0	2000	He's not happy with me, you know.
4720	7760	Yeah, I'm the life on, what life on that could be?
9440	12560	All right, I need to get a chance screen. I need to get a chance screen.
14000	23280	Why is my iPhone, whoa, my iPhone bugging the fuck? Oh, relax. What? I'm bugging out.
24240	27360	Am I getting a challenge screen? Get a challenge screen. No.
27840	33520	No, hold on, hold on, hold on. Scuffs already started, boys. Scuffs already started.
33520	38640	Look, he's a, he's the same, he's the same. One man, one mop. I was there, doing some,
39520	46640	some business things. God, the frickin scuff is a thing. What the hell's going on?
48960	56160	The tracker is hating me right now. Can you hear me? Have you all seen this? Have you all heard
56160	63200	about this? Okay, I think I'm gonna have to move the iPhone about because what the actual heck.
63200	68800	Can you guys hear the background music? I'm new. Okay, you can now. You can hear a bit of Assassin's
68800	78320	Creed. Good morning. My iPhone is bugging out right as a, I'm pretty sure this can do horizontal,
78320	84480	so not sure why I'm going to absolutely not hold on. I'm just calibrating, testing, left.
85280	92880	No, what the heck? Can you not see my face? Sorry. Blame the technology. What's that? I
92880	99200	should have used my loading screen. Sorry, can't relate. Couldn't care less. And something, something.
99200	107040	Oh my God. Is it because it's dark in this room? I can't believe it. I can't believe being a goblin
107040	113600	in the dark is a terrible idea for freaking tracking reasons. Hold on, hold on, I need to
113600	123120	come literally on my hands and knees to plug in this light under my PC. This is nonsense. Honestly,
123120	131120	why can't you see me iPhone? I'm out of the port? There are no keys. Oh my God.
131520	134800	All right, anyway, I've got some good news.
136720	143680	Well, the good news is I've got my first ASMR club coming out. Right, I've got to lay on.
143680	147200	Right, I've got to lay on. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Right, back and back
147520	154720	Yeah, that's snuffing those. Why? Can, can be chip studio not handle?
162240	166720	Why is that going? Right, I don't think the chip studio works at all horizontal. Fuck you.
167360	174960	You stupid little twat. First of all, you little prick. Can it hunt? Can it know it can't go horizontal?
175520	179520	I'm confused, but I'm ready. You know what? Fuck it. We're just jumping in. I'll,
179520	185280	I'll deal with the tracking issues once. Hold on, hold on.
188720	192320	Fuck it. There we go. I'm actually normal. I don't know why the track and bugging.
196320	197680	I'm covering up too much on the screen now.
198640	203600	Who's ready for someone's house and screen now? I do believe ASECLE is still streaming,
203600	214560	so please do support ASECLE. She's still streaming for a white Christmas.
217040	222400	Let me just check before we jump into that. I need to make sure I've got suit titles on,
222400	229280	spoken language, English subtitles on. Oh my God, I'm such a real gamer. Are you ready?
230240	234720	ASEA is just ending. Oh, does she be next? I think she'd be moving on.
237520	246240	Her God's EPS soldier. Yeah. Right, okay. Oh, actually, this is some, oh wait, no.
249200	257920	I did all my latest, like, tipper and all that if you did a donor link to me.
258000	262160	Oh, no. Oh, you know what? Fuck it. We're playing Assassin's Creed, man. Fuck the money. I want to
262160	268000	play Assassin's Creed. I wanted to say something. I don't know if you guys would like this, but
268000	272880	whenever we play a video game, obviously there's names in the video game, and it's rude for a
272880	278240	feature, but to like name people and chat. So I want it to be like special congratulations
278240	283200	if your name's Desmond, if your name is Sean, if your name's Rebecca, if your name's Lucy,
283200	288960	if your name's Ezio, like, in the video game. I don't know, like, maybe only the guy names
288960	295360	make sense, but I thought that would be a bit different. Um, yeah, special show if your name's
295360	302640	Desmond. Uh, wait, that's right, you get a name by me. Eh, there we go. Eh, Desmond, that's right,
302640	307760	your name is Desmond. Okay. I don't think anyone ever expects to wake up one morning and find
307760	314160	themselves caught in the middle of a war between two secret organizations. I know I did, but here
314160	319600	I am on one side of the world. Can you guys hear the game? Better known these days as exturgo
319600	327280	industries. We're in the business of control, politics, economics, technology. I school hope
327280	331920	you enjoyed your, uh, Tomb Raider, more like Whim Raider after I'm done with you.
338640	343680	That's terrible. It's terrible. Friends will remember we don't have HR at, uh, you,
346880	351440	did you enjoy Whim Raider? Your little EP Polar Bear? I caught the start of you swing.

544280	546960	victory
550360	555160	this is my favorite bet cuz they always glitches out the fabric always glitches
555160	557560	out on his knee in the scene it doesn't matter how many times you play through
557560	561000	this game like it is instance of new glitches gonna occur during the cut scenes
561000	565080	but it always glitches out on the knee at that cut scene to the matter how many
565080	571440	times you play it Mario what are you doing here better to be left in the hands
571440	578120	of the earth than in the hands of man I can't believe the Pope fucking vanished
578120	588960	where's that bloody popcorn sorry I'm drinking and then it makes me do hypnosis
588960	591960	I'll just get so excited okay
592480	599960	I'll be swallowed alive as a giant test for it's already occurring
604840	608800	are we ready are we ready are we ready for the best freaking voice line for
608800	618280	Mario it's such a good freaking quote
618280	627240	it's an entire area I was worried quick we have to get out of here okay so you
627240	631400	can actually jump up if you do not engage an eagle vision so we're already in
631400	635280	tutorial mode if you do not engage an eagle eagle vision the game will not let
635280	641160	you climb up at all and but until you engage it so we're playing it's your
641160	646440	auditorita friends it which means he was spawned in frenzy we are already an
646440	651880	established assassin okay we've just defeated the big bad evil and assassin
651880	655120	screen too I'll shut up
667240	672600	oh my god right okay and so yeah we're Italian so Baba the boopie all those
672600	677640	jokes this up next part section so we're still in tutorial mode obviously the game
677640	681040	but the reason why I want to mention that we're in tutorial mode is because the
681040	686160	game perfectly is structured
695120	700000	oh that's another good like you can damn what you do not understand now right so
700000	704480	we can push people out the way it my way it my way it my way rosary beats up your
704480	709120	arse leave me alone away you go Mario will actually get caught on those people
709120	718320	which is quite funny that's your uncle Mario my arm is attacked now I want
718320	724720	you to remember that pineapple for no reason at all remember the pineapple all
724720	731120	hail the pineapple all hail the pineapple okay this next section is how you get
731120	734720	one of the easiest achievements in the game and it is perfectly sequence for
734720	740480	you to do so so look alive this is how you get the you haven't you're not to get
740480	743520	hit you're not to get hit oh shit he knocked them over right hold on you
743520	749000	wait for them to attack and then if you perfectly execute all these men then you
749000	754280	get your first achievement which I believe is frenzy but if you do it
754280	760400	perfectly Mario shouldn't unfortunately the camera angles are a bit no I lost
760560	766400	the street because of the freaking camera angle anyway your first achievement is to
766400	769760	kill 10 people in a row you could easily do it at that section of the game but
769760	773920	don't worry if you miss it there are many opportunities to do so the camera
773920	779440	angle will make mess you up I was gonna say make you up
779440	783440	and the camera angles a bit funny especially when you're in between
783440	788240	buildings like it's telling me to follow Mario you must also trail behind
788240	792640	Mario a couple of meters if you are right behind him you will knock him off
792640	797040	his coded path the AI will fix itself and he will go back on the path but you
797040	800960	must give him space or you will knock him off the rooftops and then you have to
800960	805200	wait even longer for this section to occur but it's fine it's not bad section
805200	810720	this is to learn mostly rooftop moving about how to get your agility sorted
810720	814960	you can't get used to holding down I recommend oh see that's another thing
814960	818400	sometimes it say we will do something when you tell him to jump in a certain
818400	822320	direction it's fine this game has aged beautifully
822320	834560	and I believe this game came out 2012 Skyrim was 2011 again you can knock Mario
834560	838320	off this if you're too quick you must be careful
838320	846160	it was 2010 oh my god I was a baby I remember asking my dad for this game
846160	852000	and um fun fact my dad bought me the special edition sasa's crude brotherhood
852000	857280	and it came in a special box and if you opened it up I had the sasa's
857280	862320	a logo on it and you opened up the box and the game like pops up and presents
862320	866480	itself man it was freaking good here's another section if you if I
866480	870080	continue up he does not move are you ready for this I'm gonna
870080	875920	oh no like you can't progress like you have to go to the side he is in a wall
875920	879120	right now in the tutorial phase
881920	885760	yes my dad gave me it I was so happy I was so lucky
885760	889440	well I'm a sip my fish

1664640	1672000	really cried like i cried squiddin me right now eh right i'll read the the random italian
1672000	1680000	this person thinks i could think i can say ciao mio caro eraro verdre uno così belle
1680240	1692800	e cosi te lantoso for se puiowni i se gnarami la tua bellissima lingua thank you for listening
1692800	1702160	to my italian well i gotta give to compliment again on your heart love the accent by the way
1702160	1709040	how many times did you play the game to know it so well um the answer is uh i actually couldn't
1709040	1715280	even count how many times i've played this game i love you know anything killing us is that breath
1719520	1720320	take a drink of war
1724160	1728800	did you saw my mother in italian okay one of my biggest pet peeves about this game
1729680	1735040	the freaking cannons so you see how the hit markers there it looks like you're gonna hit it
1735040	1740960	and the cannons are like way loud in this game they're like far too loud they're insanely loud
1743760	1753200	foul-ass breath the guy sounds like a skyrim god most video games reuse uh voice actors so you
1753200	1758880	will recognize people over and over again it's very common if you work in a video game that you
1758880	1765760	will be used for mbc's for example um are just miscellaneous characters all the time very common
1765760	1771600	skyrim is probably the biggest example of like the same seven voice actors being used over and over
1771600	1778480	again um other than sissuru and skyrim shout out to sissuru and skyrim can't remember the actual
1778480	1786720	guy's name but goodness greatly he said hi my dear it's rare to see one so beautiful and so talented
1786720	1792560	maybe you can teach me a beautiful laugh wait you can't even speak english and you like my accent
1792560	1799680	bro you're gonna be in for a shot come on my favorite oblivion line oh let me retake that
1799680	1803520	let me redo that and they left it in the game okay we have now just finished all our three
1803520	1808560	side missions we have just handled the cannons hmm suspicious i wonder why we have also been
1808560	1815120	able to ride a horse that's because in later parts of the game horse riding is very uh necessary
1815200	1821520	to explore certain locations um it's just not possible on foot it is partly you can do it but
1821520	1827120	it just takes up so much time um and we also helped the lady which established that itseo
1827120	1833200	adetori is a bit of a bit of a ladies man and he's out for ladies holes i mean we're all out
1833200	1839120	for the ladies hole at the end of the day aren't we lads hey hope this is outrageous
1840080	1843200	by zura by zura by zura
1845680	1850960	there are two major uh hubs of english voice actors the pill from the pleasure of your presence
1850960	1859440	so this is katarina sports uh she is a real person uh did occur your mercenary a very badass
1859440	1864240	personality is likely that i can give you what you see based on a real person but we will talk later
1864560	1871040	we're like katarina do fanny and because we're getting her last hair once so far
1872080	1878080	that's her mummy mummy that's marquia velly recurring character
1884160	1888080	i wish i could show you the magic she performed very good line
1894800	1898080	there the moving painting of the goddess minerva spoke
1899360	1902400	told of a terrible tragedy to befall mankind in the future
1903360	1909520	but gave hope of lost temples that will provide aid to humanity and then she called out to a
1909520	1918000	phantom desmond as if he were there who's dead beside her after her warning she vanished
1918960	1925840	amazing i cannot imagine such wonders the vault did not house the terrible weapon fear
1926720	1933920	this is good news what about this goddess this minerva did she appear human yes but her words
1933920	1941120	proved otherwise all of her kind died many years ago i wish i could show you the magic she performed
1941200	1950240	oh that was a good delivery good delivery
1961520	1964240	the script pulled off another one i got you pulled up another one
1964480	1971760	i'm surprised she remains so composed just watching the mirror on her the spaniards lives
1975920	1983280	some of the voicelines are a bit goofy you should have killed you we're sure to suffer for it i'm not
1983280	1993200	here to debate the past together we should discuss the future no i am leaving me
1993360	1996720	i do not know why you spared him but i trust your judgment
1996720	1998640	damn straight you do uncle mario here real one
2001120	2002400	that's me uncle mario
2008320	2015760	mario maria auditory that's your mummy big mummykins did you know actually that's a bit sad
2015760	2021600	maybe not we'll just continue to the next part of the sequence oh right ready everyone group
2021600	2032000	session right now everyone get it out not for this bit the bit that follows after hold on
2036560	2041280	wait for it wait for it see this is what happens when you pay for the premium pass at the violour
2041280	2046080	meet and greet booth you're presented with a bathtub and then this part is me that's you
2046080	2048080	okay that's you in the bathtub this next bit is me
2053200	2056160	all this for a hundred dollars for the premium pass yes please
2057680	2064800	coming at you my bikini welcome home reflin in my accent obviously i'll have to like really
2064880	2071520	put on that accent welcome home reflin mom is misty
2084400	2089120	do you think a con would let us have a meet a booth that would be hilarious
2090080	2096000	oh i forgot about that part of the scene oh oh like what happens in the asmr booth stays in the
2096000	2104720	asmr booth everyone's okay everyone's uh fun fact i played this game in front of my mum and she was
2104720	2110320	mortified at this scene because i was very very young uh and i remember playing it at midnight
2110320	2115280	and i had the dining room chair in front of the tv my mom let me play it on the big tv
2116240	2124800	uh and she was like what are you playing i'm like it's a sapis grade mom please i didn't make the game
2128000	2132800	one should always have the freedom to choose oh so salty so salty
2133520	2138960	so what's that probably just training exercises
2141840	2145280	yeah damn training exercises out of control
2148320	2151280	i have to find mario and rally putting the ass in the size
2155040	2159600	actually that's another side note i can't remember why my dad needed to spell
2159600	2162880	oh i was telling my dad about like some of my favorite games of all time like a couple of years
2162880	2167040	back now he was like how do you spell assassin i was like ass ass in and we both looked at each
2167040	2174480	other like that shrek meme like like burst out laughing such children honestly
2180000	2184880	i'm not i'm not gonna lie if i felt like that my ankles would be gone they would be dust
2185600	2193200	okay this is the worst part of the game that's about to come up because you can
2193200	2195280	do everything right and the game will still fail you
2198000	2201200	so mario has the apple of eden piece of eden
2201520	2203520	away
2210960	2215760	the one italian like oh my god she really likes assassins my goodness
2218240	2223600	to say helping uh oh no we lost our monies it's not about the money money money
2224560	2227040	forget about the money money money
2228560	2233200	you do not actually have to do anything the horse will automatically run for you in this sequence
2240560	2244400	so the entire town is now being absolutely destroyed and raided and i'm currently
2244480	2246320	singing that one scottish song
2251600	2256720	all the horses get back up in this video game i just for anyone who doesn't like when the horses
2256720	2262400	go down and with you with that the horses always stand back up in video in this video game no horse
2262400	2268560	ever stays down even if it's been attacked if it's been hurt lalala okay this is the part i hate
2268560	2274800	you can destroy all the cannons and all the freaking towns people won't escape and you can
2274800	2280640	fail this section i have done it consecutively all you have to do is destroy the cannons ignore
2280640	2285520	everything else but the freaking it's really hard to tell yeah see i should have hit that third one
2285520	2294640	but it's really hard to tell like with the edges of like the radius your area of effect if you will
2294640	2296400	and my goodness gravy it's frustrating
2299120	2302560	no horses were harmed in the production of this video game no they're not so
2303120	2309600	please don't worry all horses get back up the aoe area of effect it's it's so freaking hard to
2309600	2316240	tell because you could perfectly angle it and you're like i should have three but yeah and especially
2316240	2323520	the ones on the hill this oh beautiful beautiful do that again hen do it again do it again do it
2323520	2330720	again give us three oh baby right so unfortunately you can't really do much more after you've killed
2330720	2341120	this one boom baby okay next section we've got to do this bit correct because this is where you can
2341120	2348640	fail the problem with the hill is you have to like judge behind the cannons oh triple baby
2348640	2352480	let's go three for three obviously we can't do it for this one because it's not third but
2352560	2354000	we've got three for three so far
2357040	2360960	okay wait what that one survived hello
2363600	2373600	excuse me excuse me do my eyes uh so this is the problem you can't really hit those ones
2373600	2377680	now you might be saying you should hit that big brown thing i've forgotten what their legal name
2377680	2385200	is uh but the big brown thing doesn't count uh we can kill it we've done what we can so either
2385200	2391040	we'll fail or we'll win depending on what the game feels like see there's 20 villagers 10 5
2391760	2396320	we did it we didn't get a balista a siege tower i
2399600	2405040	soldiers are climbing the walls okay this is one bit i don't like about this game are you ready for
2406000	2412240	they change your weapons so they've given me a sword i've said uh let me keep my blade out because
2412240	2417600	i prefer fighting with a blade the only enemies that you're not to go against with the blade
2417600	2425040	jump down nco jeez yeah my ankles would be disintegrated if i did that um it's much easier
2425040	2431760	to fight with the blades oh my god he just curbstomped that borja guy did you see that nco
2431760	2441280	that's a war crime you can't curb stomp people that's not how it works jeez it's the old okay hold on
2442320	2446080	these enemies oh my god i just got twatted oh i'm getting twat twice sorry i'm too busy
2446080	2452320	try and be chatting and kill at the same time um no i'm missing oh no everyone gonna know i'm a
2452320	2460080	terrible gamer um the only enemies that are not effective so like these guys for fuck's sake
2460080	2464160	they freaking attack before they're supposed to you can break their stance just by spamming
2464160	2468720	it's not a problem again you for these guys that are double armored up literally take your gun out
2468720	2474000	boom up it didn't register esio he's getting a bit close mate you're gonna need to aim
2476560	2478240	that was getting a bit close for comfort
2480880	2486480	point blank esio that probably wasn't even five meters no been do we need to put glicks on him
2487360	2493360	oh this is a sad bit
2500560	2501360	no
2517120	2521360	this is an invitation my family to yours
2522320	2524240	to yours
2541200	2547040	there was a sentence that he said though that your friend this gun that your friend fashioned for
2547360	2554160	keep that in mind i can walk faster means to stop in italian
2557760	2565040	so we are now basically running on fumes adrenaline wise we've literally just been
2565040	2572960	absolutely destroyed we have three bullet wounds i think shoulder uh abdomen oh okay
2572960	2576320	just to show we've got two bullet wounds i could have sworn it used to be three but
2576320	2582240	i won't probably just wish me wish me remember being uh but yeah we've literally our liver is
2582240	2590240	currently bleeding out our kidney most like ow what happened there did you see me get turned
2590240	2599440	into that rubbish pile i was like liquid did you see that ouch i don't want to be jelly please don't
2599440	2604720	turn me into jelly hey leaf claudia lonia bam
2607280	2612320	so you'll get assigned one soldier to kill in the sequence but they all do they all are aggressive
2612320	2619280	towards you you can clean them up if you really desire but if the arrow is red that means the
2619280	2625840	ai has assigned to attack you if the arrow is yellow they'll attack oh also the guards have
2625920	2630880	assassin abilities like how are you sitting on the wall the coding in this game is a bit funny
2632160	2636480	if you upset NPCs they turn into assassins and start climbing walls and stuff
2637440	2642400	you could always break a guard's stance with a kick if you are struggling to fight them
2643120	2650640	but we do get access to long range weaponry very shortly um but yeah uh you can ignore all these
2651520	2656400	and just go straight in here no you can you have to wait until they're assigned to you okay okay
2656400	2664640	okay the game does it quite often where it won't let you in if uh someone is target locked onto you
2666320	2670560	hey come on claudia we ain't got all day jesus we're under a siege take your time hen
2670800	2678080	it's you i'm in here i will hold the back stop wait for us we thought you had to kill sir etio
2678080	2683120	not yet where does this passage lead to the north outside the walls are you surprised it exists

2717680	2722560	we will play assassin's creed 2 because that is a very beautiful section in assassin's creed 2
2723120	2727440	we're essentially playing assassin's creed 2.5 it's fame brotherhood's good game
2729040	2733840	right lure lure i'm gonna take a war sip war sipping tin take a sip with me if you don't got war

2765840	2766240	sorry

2774640	2778320	just love this game a little everything about it the patience fantastic we've
2778320	2783920	completed sequence dna one battle wounds achievement unlocked
2796560	2801120	i will tell you at the end a very sad fact about that blonde girl you see on the screen right now
2802720	2806880	but only at the end right so that says in present day
2809280	2817760	congrats if your name's desmond congrats congrats if your name's shawn shawn's one with glasses

2823840	2828880	when she are they tame traveling where's the autotorizo i will tell you in a second it's our
2828880	2834000	last safe but we were present day it turns out the templars are watching the border etio hid the
2834000	2841200	the poe sometime in 1507 but when i try to access that dna sequence he seems to be remembering
2841200	2849520	something else like a memory inside a memory yes exactly maybe exactly maybe i believe you
2849520	2854320	experienced something similar if i could have stagger didn't you subject 15 exhibited memory
2854320	2860240	within memory like patterns but she was pregnant the memories of prego's father and not in this
2860800	2871840	oh my god we've just been fat shamed in 2024 you guys remember when bao got that model
2872640	2878480	and she was like inflated and someone was like this is fat shaming it was like no bro that's real
2878480	2880320	34 open your eyes
2892000	2895760	legend coming out in inflation model and someone's like you're fat shaming it no more the bugger
2909280	2912880	they're gonna find us no they aren't come with me
2928160	2931920	there's a lot of cutscene stuff up ahead but i'll try and for those who don't know the game
2931920	2936880	i will very quickly summarize from the inside we're not getting in this way what's her next
2936880	2941760	move the road just moves back into the highway this is not a good place for us to be right now
2941760	2946000	do we have any tarps we need to cover up the van i really hate to stress this yeah but we are

2953360	2957200	maybe there's another way into the sanctuary hey i think i've got something
2957440	2966720	okay so we're modern day Desmond if you don't know the game we basically have a special bloodline
2967920	2974400	that commutes to the gods that created us and and we use Desmond's DNA sequence in order to go
2974400	2981200	back in the past very fictional based i absolutely love the concept when i was a child and i wanted
2981200	2989200	it to be so real i was like take me back to the battle of anaconda take me to big willy walrus
2990480	2991920	i want to see the construction

3042400	3050080	to hide it what was that i don't see anything so Desmond also sees the past because his it's
3050080	3055440	basically leaking into his present so Lucy can't see any of this we can see this
3059200	3066480	they escaped through here what that's you and the villagers after the attack i can see them now
3067840	3073680	i know it's difficult but try to compartmentalize focus on the present what if i can't stop the

3080240	3085520	the bleeding effect that he's talking about and ended up in himself but we learn more about him in

3302080	3307920	the shadow before see this is the thing about playing the same game over and over something
3307920	3313280	you'll happen every time and it's just fantastic anyway we're about to swim in medieval toxic waste
3316240	3318000	the game's being coded as you play
3318160	3321440	easy for you you aren't swimming in medieval toxic waste
3322800	3324240	it was lucy's idea
3328800	3334480	whoa whoa uh see when the camera angles start to shift it actually makes things like really hard
3334480	3343040	to judge it's good for the skin remember that one post where that guy was like i'll for 500
3343120	3348000	dollars let me go in your septic tank and he just hangs out in there and does the thing and it was
3348000	3352800	like oh you're i mean yeah that was quite the pose
3357040	3362400	you're going so fast the game can't keep up that was minging on his phone

3398080	3400560	now i'm wet i'm a cut of fish i was wet from the start
3405280	3411040	human resources why a septic tank it's just what the guy wanted it's like that japanese post
3411760	3418400	oh this is another thing there is this is a true hashtag true story um
3419520	3428800	so this wife went away on holiday for the weekend and her neighbor on friday went into her like
3428800	3435040	toilet tank like japanese toilets are different from the way it's like done so he could look up
3435040	3442400	and peep at her while she disintegrated basically um and because she went away on holiday uh that
3442400	3454160	man perished uh via um freezing to death in kaka it was like bro don't get me wrong i'm no really
3454320	3461280	any shame in anyone for what they like but to die to die i'll wait here
3461920	3468000	it's a bit extreme it's a bit extreme like oh i did the last one oh jisun messed up on that one
3468000	3481680	i'm not gonna lie oh jisun uh got it yeah thank you desmond did they scatter his ashes that's too

3500720	3506160	a desmond has with lucy jesus i have the bleeding effect myself no no before you freaking take
3506240	3512800	that out of context the bleeding effect is when desmond thingy's uh vtuber's stomach is so it must

3544640	3549200	yellow hello should i be worried do we need to get you a doctor
3550000	3560240	when the past memories and new ones melt in yes desmond has a very hard time differentiating
3560240	3566240	himself from xio because he spends so much time in the animus as xio i mean you'd do it too
3567360	3571760	you'd do it too you'd do it too all right friendly over the section

3752320	3756640	kind of shocked that i'm like yeah just do what you want like whatever you want go for it you can
3756640	3760720	see what you want obviously as long as you don't see any nda content you can talk about the interview
3760720	3766160	with me if you want you can talk about how you found the process talk about how you found the debut
3766160	3774720	um yeah just do what you want have fun i'm here to be a booty hole right look around montoregioni
3774720	3779120	for circuiters and a little dude asked they'll re-route small amounts of electricity to the
3779120	3783280	power line underneath the villa don't ask me how they work if i understood that i wouldn't be the
3783280	3793200	the fella hiding the van i used to think he um he is he wheatley i think he might be wheatley
3793200	3802880	i'm not sure from uh portal 2 so we're now currently getting an energy supply to the animus
3802880	3809840	underneath the villa in order for upstair go the big baddies are called upstair go in this game
3809840	3815200	or templar so those are the big baddies um so basically you just need to go around the city
3815200	3820560	you can see that the patched everything up from the uh five centuries ago uh that the big old
3820560	3829840	fights were occurring i really like stacey milk i saw the reaction to fondle a bosom
3831600	3838080	admit that it was funny okay admit that it was funny or pick up 24 cards in uno right now
3838080	3844160	and anyone sitting with 24 cards in their hand are liars okay fondle a bosom was hilarious i don't
3844160	3851440	care i think someone was like it sounds like you're naming them from like that parody um uh that parody
3851440	3858560	movie uh austin powers and i'm like yeah you're supposed to have fun names who want serious names
3858560	3866320	that like no one can remember like cuttles cuttlefish okay strongy cuttles let's go uh a polar bear
3866320	3872080	okay i see i see snow paws yes she has paws and she's cold i see snow paws let's go like it's
3872080	3877200	really it's not that bad um so you're supposed to just look around with eagle vision to get a sense
3877200	3884160	of moving around um and all that jazz there's like one right next to me isn't there yet it's right
3884160	3897600	behind me uh box that was not a name carambi no carambi for like a cs go whichever perfect name
3897600	3904240	don't care carambi yes and caram sounds like ha ha ram so you can probably make a few puns
3904400	3913280	yes it's booted we're good to go yes it's booted name from money python's life of bright incontinent
3913280	3919280	above african saw you's all laughing at it and someone posted that incontinent to a screenshot
3919280	3924000	i was like oh no they've got me laughing that was like oh that was actually really funny
3924800	3929120	right we're going in the animus we're about to go back into the past to be it's your auditory
3929120	3933600	if we're still in the tutorial stage i will tell you when we get out of this tutorial stage
3933600	3940320	we've still probably got another hour in a bit sanctuary sanctuary as you may have noticed in
3940320	3945600	the van i've made some improvements to the animus and i've already seen a new vr training program
3946880	3951680	here you can show off all those flashy moves you picked up from your ancestors let me open one
3951680	3959360	in the mission ac show ac hall okay but it doesn't make sense maybe if we had like a fire and ace
3959360	3965120	like vtuber design ac no we can't like call ac we already have ac oh oh shit okay so this is
3965120	3972320	the virtual training i despise it i absolutely despise it i just cannot stand this section
3972320	3978400	it's for people who enjoy the combat or practice in it me i hate to despise it okay you see that
3978400	3985520	skinny guard he is a problem they can grab you yeah see the guards are trying to grab me and then
3985520	3992080	it breaks your streak if they grab you and it's so annoying i freaking hate the wee guards honestly
3992640	3998000	oh and i hate the lancers too i absolutely hate it i'm much better in combat yeah fuck you take it
3998960	4004320	take it the lancers have much bigger reach and are very hard to counter so when you're on a
4004320	4009280	killing streak it's much better to aim for those guys to defend your streak basically
4009280	4017840	skinny ball bad guards oh honestly lancers hate the skinny guards hate because they are agile
4017840	4023360	warriors and you have to freaking have a wee knife out in order to counter them properly
4024240	4032720	shrimp check yep posture still shrimp thank you oh we're in the tutorial for like another two hours
4032720	4038000	but the reason i'm going to praise the game is because it's hidden that you're in the tutorial
4040000	4044880	you progress through the story of the game via the tutorial like i know it sounds silly to praise
4044880	4051520	that because obviously all games work like that but i'll kind of point it out if you need to take
4051520	4057680	a break log out of the anime you can leave the machine whenever you like i'm all set to go don't
4057680	4063920	worry one last thing as you raise your synchronization by executing is that the way
4063920	4069520	press memories might even discover some repressed memories she be caught in bottom
4075920	4079600	ass and feet locked on that seat oh that's actually a really good like model
4080400	4084720	ready for like a eight hour stream ass and feet get on that suit
4086960	4092000	anyway i never expected you to see you play something i have terrible news but these
4092000	4097680	shippers normally play a video game with eye in the database now you won't find it
4105200	4107280	okay we're here present day
4109920	4113760	give me one second i'm gonna get a cola okay i'll leave that on so at least i'm not yapping
4113760	4117520	over the actual cutscenes for once in my freaking life
4136000	4141120	oh my god we're being touched by a whammy sorry i forget my hip i need to close my eyes if i walk
4141120	4148000	away so the sleep thing clicks on right but come on me come on me oh my god listen to the music

4194880	4202320	just appreciate it for what it is and this game come out in 2010 and it aged beautifully i will
4202320	4207760	not tell i will not take anyone telling me this game didn't age well so we're currently injured
4207760	4213760	and going to the doctor we're about to learn about health bar so we're still injured we're
4213760	4221440	still hurt in the top left corner we have five health squares and only one left that is how
4221440	4226000	we deal with health in the game do not take that horse i don't know why they put that horse there
4226000	4229760	unironically you don't go any faster on the horse to get to the healer
4232960	4236880	trying to tip you it says internal server it's okay you don't have to give me money just hanging
4236880	4242320	out it's fine i'm not sure what the problem is but hey but don't worry you don't have to give me
4242320	4247840	money thank you for being here for a man of your age tisk tisk
4247840	4252480	someone your age cannot recover from your wound like this with medicine here is something to
4252480	4259360	dull the pain it would heal over time four out of five doctors would suggest leeches
4260880	4267120	no leeches things however i can recommend several good colleagues around the sea do you
4267120	4273840	need anything else have fun at work don't worry guys if you ever have to leave stream i am an
4273840	4280000	endurance streamer i'm not very friendly because i'm a long time streamer um i do plan on streaming
4280000	4288240	for eight hours or finishing the story mode of this game um and tomorrow we will 100% it
4288240	4295360	because i've never 100% at the game before but with your encouragement i think it's possible
4295360	4301840	i think i could 100% this game when you collect all the board your tower like the flags um
4302800	4307120	all the hidden flags that are also in the halls of narrow which i will teach you all about very
4307120	4314800	shortly so this beautiful cutscene is how we unlock sections of the map on the HUD okay they're all
4314800	4321120	hidden at the moment but we are going to be doing map update as you can see uh synchronized view
4321120	4329120	points beauty beauty beauty it jokes on you i'm listening at work oh my god those are the naughty
4329360	4341280	naughty stinky borja we don't like borja we don't take kindly to your kind around these parts borja
4343760	4351680	100% in this game in two days possible yes sir with autism anything is possible i'm so sorry
4351680	4360560	i'm so sorry i apologize um i am very passionate about what i'm passionate about and if i am like
4360560	4366400	unable to do so so ie i can just straight up like play this game the way i wanted then yes
4366400	4373760	we're also like 100% in skyrim next week achievement one i'm so sorry it must be like really weird
4373760	4379360	just randomly coming out with it i'll uh we'll refer to the strontism how about that so we're
4379360	4384960	currently tailing do you see the yellow hit marker or hit box above these this is tailing it means
4384960	4390640	do not be discovered by them they can be pushed by npcs so they can turn around and look at you
4390640	4398000	it's not um it's not the best but um it certainly works perfectly well um
4400320	4405200	it's absolutely beautiful game so we're just entailing these guards don't look backwards
4405200	4411040	unless an npc kindly bumps into them so we can get as close as we want we can like creep on the
4411040	4415840	walls cc he just turned around there if i wasn't creeping on the wall even the game's like uh you
4415840	4419760	should maintain your distance you're a bit too close but we can like creep creeping
4436160	4440880	okay and you can also blend in but i am not controlling the movement of this crowd the
4440880	4446560	crowd will go on a certain path so you can part ways but you cannot be discovered while concealed
4446560	4452640	in a crowd like this guards can walk by me i can have high notoriety and guards will ignore me as
4452640	4459840	long as i am coming 100% in the achievements in skyrim sorry i don't mean 100% in skyrim because
4459920	4465680	that is impossible as you said because of the repeating quest factors the achievements i have
4465680	4471600	100% in skyrim achievements multiple times and i would absolutely love to share the experience
4471600	4480480	with you and tell you about all the secret uh little bits i know um and yeah okay i'm also
4480480	4485520	going to mention the multiplayer in brotherhood i believe the servers are down okay oh whoa that
4485520	4491280	just came out nowhere hold on hold on we weren't even at the we were not even at the section okay we
4491280	4500720	didn't even go we were nco didn't kill civilians did that kill a human like a non-guard what is
4500720	4507280	going on oh my god sorry the sequence was not supposed to start on that staircase it's supposed
4507440	4511200	to start by this freaking did that kill him if i'm a citizen
4517920	4524160	what just happened i think i was too distracted i apologize but don't worry we can always replay
4524160	4530400	and come back for 100 percent i can't believe i just killed a citizen i never make that mistake
4530400	4533520	in this game sorry
4544080	4545520	i too have lost family to the rope
4545600	4553200	i understand how can you my libya was innocent i have lost family to the rope treachery
4555360	4559440	you called you cuddled off that's so hangy if i cut her rope
4563360	4569520	what the fuck down sorry you guys didn't see that all these options just popped up on my screen
4570240	4577440	i was like these are too many things going on right now okay so this quest do you see how
4577440	4582640	we are assigned someone with a name that is because you're actually killing multiplayer
4582640	4589280	characters that are in multiplayer i know it sounds silly and i know it sounds bizarre but
4590480	4596080	when you could play uh assassin's group brotherhood multiplayer um you got to pick between the skins
4596080	4601680	and we're literally about to kill someone who is a skin in the multiplayer mode uh 100 for this
4601680	4607280	one is just air assassination super simple and easy uh the guards do attack you but some turn
4607280	4613200	into cowards once you kill multiple guards which is a lovely paypal support doesn't open for several
4613200	4623200	hours did i break paypal are you guys trying to support me too much that we broke paypal
4623760	4630960	wait can none of the girls get donations right now uh so you can't be grabbed but as i said
4630960	4635920	the more guards you kill some of the weaker ones like the ones with just a hat will turn into
4635920	4642720	cowards which is an absolutely lovely human detail yeah see the ones with uh those like
4642720	4651760	beret type hats they turn into cowards beautiful beautiful detail i think that is gorgeous to show
4651840	4658480	human nature instead of the ai just being like constantly attack attack attack die die die
4658480	4668480	because you will i just think these are and this is 2010 development was 20 2008 2008 maybe even
4668480	4676240	as far back as 2007 um so you're not allowed to scale the rooftops because guards find you extremely
4676240	4682640	sussy but guards on the floor don'ts like this guy does not care about me right now um but like
4682640	4689360	for development that far back to like capture to even think outside the box to capture human nature
4689360	4696560	like that definitely hats off to the development team um i know it is by ubisoft and there are some
4696560	4704320	very there's a very unique ending to this tale and assassins crude brotherhood and i couldn't for
4704320	4711040	the life of me uh there's a feather up on here by the way uh you can grab sightings if you cite
4711040	4716000	something but can't grab it you can go into ego mode and then it'll automatically stick to your map
4716000	4721760	which is fantastic so if you see something but you can't grab it in the moment um but yeah
4723440	4733440	this game has also been rated in the top 100 games of all time i believe it placed around 60th
4733440	4740640	on recent 100 uh game ranking tech things but sas crude brotherhood always makes it and i 100
4740640	4747120	agree for me it is first place but i'm biased but absolutely deserved it so we have met marquia
4747120	4753680	veli this is marquia veli he was the guy um that was in the villa and that was disappointed in us
4753680	4761360	not killing the spaniard uh and he is gonna tell us what's going on in roma because we don't know
4761360	4766240	what's going on in roma we know the borja is everywhere as we can see them literally in front
4766240	4771920	of us right now so we are going to get the dirty details on what's going on in roma you would be
4771920	4780080	wise to purchase missing equipment you will not live long in roma without supplies i have my blade
4780960	4788000	and the guards have their guns good to see of the borja fortunately i can help
4793360	4797760	borja hate we hate the borja perhaps you will listen to reason i'm gonna burp is that okay
4798320	4804160	i will let you know that was me popping my lips that was the actual burp sorry sorry to mislead
4804160	4810240	you like that so you need to wait for a little second because if you go too quickly into the
4811120	4817040	blacksmith the items won't actually be available to purchase which is your literal quest so you're
4817040	4822800	buying an armor and a small weapon this small weapon is what you use against the skinny guards
4822800	4829680	because it is amazing for taming on defending yourself now you can survive that's right that's
4829680	4832880	right i debated you didn't know yeah you thought that pop was my burp
4832880	4836080	and
4858080	4860320	so for some reason even though you're right next to him
4860320	4863520	he gets really quiet in certain voicelines
4873760	4875920	i'm literally hugging him to get him to talk
4880960	4881520	money
4885520	4887520	jar of leeches
4890400	4897520	so again eagle vision to lock in that flag because we can't grab it right now but that's okay
4898400	4898720	so
4912640	4920560	okay so we're starting to learn that the borja has overtaken roma and is completely messing up for
4920560	4928080	the people and mark you avail is obviously not very happy but we have to do what the current
4928080	4938880	laid-out rules are and the yummy jar of leeches the cuttlefish eat leeches i feel like they probably
4938880	4941200	do
4945040	4946160	i'll talk after this but
4948640	4955120	water check should we not travel by horse roma is quite large as chaserates conquest in romania
4955120	4961280	continue to succeed the borja growing power they have taken desirable areas of the city for
4961280	4968400	themselves we cannot use the stables here oh they will have the borja is low now what are
4968400	4974480	you implying it's you do not play dumb with me matthew early do you have some kind of plan
4974480	4981840	i am improvising okay now to very quickly bring you up to speed the borja are forbidding us in
4981840	4988880	this section to use the stables and other areas of development also this is the most
4988880	4995600	fucking annoying thing to get a hundred percent on hold on oh get off the horse i hate when they
4995600	5003120	go on the horse oh no i've made it so much worse okay so this captain you have to grab him and put
5003120	5010160	him in that um uh oh my god that freaking citizen was in the way i didn't want to strike in case
5010160	5017520	i can't see because of the camera angle by the way this game aged really well it aged really well
5017520	5028000	i promise it aged well no right i am going to no he's on it no this couldn't have gone any worse
5029360	5035360	please i've never had this issue in this game before right just grab him grab him and push him
5035360	5041440	fuck him you can kill no right no right we're not a hundred percent in this right now i'm literally
5041520	5048400	bright red an embarrassment of this gameplay where fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you
5051600	5058160	please get off the horses i hate when they're on the horses all right maybe i can do it hold on
5058160	5064080	oh my god i can still 100 percent it okay you need to basically drag this guy to the scaffolding
5064080	5074720	and push him in it yes whenever you kill a captain of a district always loot his body he has insane
5074720	5081280	amounts of money on his person that was terrible but we resurrected it the reason and you have to kill
5081280	5086960	the other guards first is so you are free to push that guy into the scaffolding to achieve 100 on this
5087520	5094480	borgia tower my god i have never attracted those other four guards before i've never had them jump
5094480	5105760	on freaking horses before that was terrible but we did it we got a hundred percent oh my god
5105760	5112560	i'm my face is bright red i'm like oh my god oh i forgot to burn the tower oh for goodness sake
5112560	5120000	we're okay we need to call it not the tower oh my god i'm getting so flustered oh right so we've
5120000	5127360	just reclaimed this district so you need to burn the tower to in order to symbolize to the borgia
5127360	5132320	they're no longer welcome in this area and their rules no longer apply to this current district of
5132320	5141680	roma okay wait i'm an idiot markia valley hasn't told me to burn the tower yet please pardon me
5141680	5149360	for jumping that i'm skipping ahead of the game right out my way out my way out my way out my way
5149360	5153520	the guards make peep you here but they don't actually get you okay we are now giving instructions
5157920	5163280	you are right we need to send they see oh i might need to take my hoodie off i'm sweating and embarrassed
5163280	5167840	man i was like oh my god you guys are gonna think i've never played this game before i'm like no
5167840	5172160	it's my favorite game of all time the guards outside there will peep you but they'll never
5172160	5178240	follow you inside as long as you keep moving yeah the guards will never go for you um literally
5178240	5184400	xio is exhausted he's climbed this tower three times now he's like jesus women give me a break
5184400	5189840	okay you can ignite to the borgia tower like so
5198240	5211520	oh because they all get killed okay now this is another interesting part of the
5211520	5216080	game which you can renovate districts to have an income
5220080	5227680	the controller vibration on the literally uh is crazy okay we have just renovated the
5227680	5236160	stables we now have access to horsey warseys yeah no so we will jump on a horse thank you
5236160	5246480	horse vtuber we love you he does he's supposed to talk to you through this but it bugs out so

5253200	5259120	it's dangerous roma have been here the borgia have like settled their ways the people are scared
5259120	5264480	basically too long didn't read thank you marquia valley for your input it always bugs out he should

5291440	5298000	oh he mad at us i am inclined to disagree look at this is the center of borgia
5299600	5304240	killing one man and not change this you need to take away the source about

5624560	5631120	my heart feels full of relief it is so bootyful um obviously because of it's an older game you

5638320	5644480	that sometimes i get a little bit excited but i'm sure you like it when a girl screams in your ear

5655840	5656960	okay there we go we made it
5656960	5661760	did you liberate your money from our friend
5662320	5668400	and be a small victory they are up and time with work we'll have a few dozen more
5668400	5674400	depends on the the the subject six you mentioned we'll be broken we'll do that at the end i don't
5674400	5679120	want to do subject 16 right now where is my contact Vinicius he should have already intercepted the
5679120	5686320	letter okay follow me okay we are now raiding our horses through roma uh mark your valley is
5686400	5691760	just kind of spanked us for being like you believe in the people and esio goes yeah i believe in the
5691760	5696000	people and then the people just stole a lot of money from us but we got it back that's fine that's
5696000	5703200	the main thing but esio is starting the concept of the brotherhood of assassins where you take an
5703200	5710880	ordinary citizen who is fed up with life who is being treated badly who has just had an absolutely
5710880	5718240	awful time and you've gone hey do you want to get back at your oppressors and then they go uh cc
5718240	5723680	because obviously they're italian they wouldn't say yes they'd say see you and then the good part of
5723680	5729040	the the best part i would argue about this game starts up from there
5731360	5733360	okay so we're just following horsey horsey around
5736320	5740000	i love you excelene because i'm low IQ don't worry i'm low IQ in general but these are just
5740080	5747520	one of the games that i'm like uh i love everything about see the means of the projection
5751520	5757840	astronomy can relate to being a precious gosh steady on thankfully i was born in a good time
5757840	5764320	line but uh if you didn't know the english tried to eradicate uh scottish people many a time uh
5764320	5773200	however uh the romans built a wall called hadrian's wall because they weren't interested in going
5773200	5780000	any further into scotland they said now you guys can keep it we're not interested in invading us
5781040	5782960	that's true that's actually science
5786480	5793120	leave my thieves alone you foul beast oh that was a bit steady on it esio what was that so you're
5793120	5799280	supposed to like jump on them okay well we got countered so i'll just be up this i just kicked
5801040	5807920	i've never had these issues oh my god performance i can't get up one in three men
5812000	5816400	time me at the term the bass okay we'll find you at the bass okay we're about to do a major
5816400	5823680	tutorial part coming up but don't worry it's like a good part um so we're just gonna skedaddle halfway
5823680	5829840	through this we're currently in the coliseum uh coliseum has been wrecked for many a century now
5829840	5837360	this is very accurate to probably what it looks like i'm going one one one one in three men but
5837360	5850800	one in one coliseum how dare you i assure you my bony bony can my my pecker um it's so easy to get
5851760	5860240	to get engorged oh my god i want to be an announcer any engorgers anyone getting
5860560	5869280	engorged right now yeah yeah i bet you are okay this part if we can do it flawlessly first time
5869280	5876080	so i don't need to be embarrassed however the game crashes at this part multiple times for me so
5878000	5883120	first things first take out your wee knife know the big knife take out your wee knife okay
5884000	5889040	for this part that comes up because you're supposed to not get hit god damn you can see me
5889040	5898960	river and moon walked into that sequence there we are about to encounter a second enemy not
5900160	5912560	the border romuli let's see if i can do this without messing up okay pause you have to reselect
5912560	5919600	your small knife because the game always right if i don't get hit i am blessed by the gods because
5919600	5929760	you're supposed to do the sequence without getting hit i hate when they attack that blinking means
5929760	5934320	they're attacking and you can't if they have the red hit marker above their head you can't
5934320	5939120	tell if they're about to okay we got we got the ten in a row serial killer achievement
5939200	5946240	oh we did it hundred percent of that oh that bit always stresses me at my heart rate
5948000	5955040	okay this is a tutorial sequence this is called the layers of romulus
5955680	5959520	goya or romuli if you you want to get take his baking but romulus
5959760	5969600	wow i swear she killed them all with one knife so this is timed okay we're on a timer
5970480	5978320	and you will watch me pass up flags and as well as pass up treasure boxes because we will have to
5978320	5982800	come back in a hundred percent this section because in order to get the hundred percent
5983680	5990880	and time love is what this one is so we're just gonna speed on by we're gonna do a little speed
5990880	5996320	gonzalez i am not going to read chat for eight minutes it takes me about seven minutes to do
5996320	6002080	the sequence the timer is eight minutes i apologize chat i can see you rating my burp in the corner
6002080	6008240	of my eye you must always do the levers in this order in order to maximize your time
6008240	6016640	um it is possible that you fall in a sequence and you'll lose time um but normally i finish
6017200	6025040	roughly 40 seconds to one minute early um unfortunately this game's a bit funnery i've
6025040	6030160	just wasted a bit of time doing that which is a shame but hey ho it's what happens
6031200	6037680	uh but yes obviously you can tell the music's a bit different the i don't know how compose the music
6037760	6045200	or who is commissioned to compose the music very very good okay i can read you for like one second
6045200	6052720	she hates us no i'm done i need to do the time sequence i finish early oh i finish early all
6052720	6059840	right you want to tell me you can tell you how early i finish i think i've said this before but um
6060560	6069840	my record is like one minute and like 54 seconds roughly and the only reason i know why is because
6069840	6077040	that's how long the preview was for the video it was a free preview i'm just gonna admit it sorry but
6077600	6084640	if you guys are like i'm so nervous to talk to her in chat i am absolutely not destined
6085440	6095440	uh to be professional or whatever but yeah that's actually true story i could probably find the
6095440	6106240	video and share it um if you really wanted to see how good that preview was um we're under a timer so
6106240	6117040	we are just gonna kind of right okay you need to look for the open gate and i get it wrong all
6117040	6122000	the time but open gate and then take a no oh my god i get it wrong all the time do you know how
6122000	6126960	many times i've freaking played this game and i do that every single time you'd think i'd learn
6126960	6138880	honestly uh one day i'll learn but i have a fun factoid that i will tell you later once we get
6138880	6144800	to that part of the thingy but uh this will not be the only time we are playing Assassin's Creed
6144800	6155120	on this channel a Assassin's Creed brotherhood on this channel in particular um because i um have
6155120	6163360	very much tism this game into submission and i don't know should i just ruin it you know what if
6163360	6170720	you're here right now i think i'm allowed to ruin it so my birthday is the 10th of october
6171760	6178240	um oh you must always grab this light the game will pretend like you can do it so october 10th is
6178240	6185360	my donathan and you'll never guess what date uh gets mentioned in this video game october 10th
6185360	6193200	so we're playing it on my donathan um and i get to nerd about the game all over again and i'm already
6193200	6200320	beaming with happiness just thinking about it i was like oh no no no no i'm going to subject you
6200320	6206560	this twice you will you will watch me play this game twice and be so happy about it
6208720	6214800	um we're getting close to the main hall the main hall is where the last major part of the
6214800	6220480	sequence comes in i'm glad the game didn't crash actually earlier because i've not really had i
6220480	6225680	don't really experience any crashing after the wolf section once you've killed all the romuli guys
6225680	6232400	then uh not once have i had the game crash on multiple playthroughs um this game was literally
6232400	6237600	made for me for real for real like actually though like i mean how did they know like oh my god this
6237600	6246800	is work um for safety i just follow this i think you maybe can jump off as a fire but uh i'm not
6246800	6255920	risking the run i do not want to play this like section again it's not boring but hmm
6257440	6261760	i'm trying to choose my words carefully as if the dev team are sitting here watching they're not
6261760	6268640	um obviously every game section you have a preference for me being tamed to claim about
6268640	6273520	isn't but i understand that they do have to introduce some sort of element like
6274320	6281360	not to panic the player but if you were just to willfully glide through these areas then it might
6281920	6289840	be quite boresome any boresoms there's a flag to the left we will not be collecting it there's
6289840	6294320	also a treasure box up ahead again we're not going to be collecting it we are trying to get
6294320	6300000	our eight-minute timer we have entered a cutscene and we will also have a foot set there this is
6300000	6305760	the grand hall this is the last section and it's a nightmare if you mess up on it but uh i've done
6305760	6315200	it quite a lot so the CEO of Ubisoft sitting in here like you're doing what to my game um
6316000	6323360	um i always mess this bit up as well you need to look for this one in order to get inside
6325920	6336160	this section um now Assassin's Creed was made long before the yellow paint so they use candle
6336160	6341600	light and fixtures i'll show you one section that really highlights the old candle fixtures
6342240	6348080	and we're about to break this so don't be shocked it's quite loud at the breaking
6351040	6355040	yeah so the game will help you in case you mess up because they have been
6355760	6360800	they know they've made it awkward so you saw that those treasure boxes you see that flag there
6360800	6365120	again we're just gonna ignore it we're here for the speed run and we're not i actually don't know
6365120	6369920	what the speed run of this game would be i assume it's probably like under three hours the first
6369920	6374240	time i played this it took me so long to figure out where i had to go you have to go on the chair
6375200	6379440	literally the chair and then this little pathetic beam do you know how long it took me to find this
6379440	6385760	beam as a child like i started asking my mum for help because my mum plays Tomb Raider and she was
6385760	6391760	like then you look at me straw day and i'm like mum you're smiling like i'm a child you can you
6391760	6399920	must be able to see uh you must also grab a lot um to to like save yourself see this doesn't look
6399920	6406400	like you should be able to grab it but if you hold b you can get it sorry i play xbox controller uh
6406400	6415120	i don't know what it is for like ps uh four is it triangle no triangles why um
6415920	6417040	but yeah
6419440	6423760	we're almost there we're doing good for time we've not actually made any mistakes yet like
6423760	6428880	such as falling off falling off is the oh man is she fell off okay okay dude you're done
6428880	6435920	um it's the biggest mistake you can make in these time sequences uh but don't worry the game does
6435920	6442800	try to resurrect you so this is the freaking jump that i've it's freaking humongous and it's you
6442800	6451040	know you cannot make that in real life but we are perfect for times um and when you pick up
6451040	6457280	the objective the timer stops so you could in theory go back and get all the stuff you missed
6458240	6464880	however i am much more happier to continue on with the campaign but this is a tutorial section
6464880	6472960	that's part of the main quest line um for the layer of Romulus which there are six total
6474000	6480320	and it unlocks you special armor uh i personally don't actually go right we're gonna pick it up
6480320	6485920	we're gonna pick it up so we're picking it up now so the timer has now officially stopped we are no
6485920	6492800	longer under the eight minute timer so i leave my family's armor in here one of the finest sets
6492800	6500080	ever made may you who finds it receive strength and battle change of handwriting we have taken it
6500080	6506720	and set it back behind the iron door six keys unlock it spread amongst our brothers it shall
6506720	6513840	be said to come from your Romulus and they will worship it and we have a picture of the armor
6513840	6519920	that we may unlock at a later time again i don't normally unlock it through my like first playthrough
6519920	6524320	it's not necessary it's a bit time consuming as well it's probably like an extra hour so the
6524320	6530960	timer is paused if i pause the game time remaining 133 so yeah we can pick up all these treasure
6530960	6538080	boxes because we're gonna need it you get florins in this game and the campaign actually requires
6538080	6545120	you to have 3,500 florins at one section um and we just want to make sure we go above and beyond
6545120	6552560	because we cannot invest in like properties for example that part comes very soon um
6554480	6560800	how kind of them to write in clear uh yeah detail for us to read their uh evil plans basically
6560800	6568640	but there we go ancient roman tomowers would you like to taste my ancient roman tomato
6569520	6576880	that tomato at golden boy achievement unlock so we've done one that's one layer of Romulus
6579760	6585440	i'm gonna head off thank you for hanging please don't worry i believe shibi is coming up in an hour
6586880	6589360	no in 10 minutes who's coming up next
6593520	6597680	i'm going to take a drink i believe the gorgeous are supporting them is that where the ketchup
6597920	6603920	no you're done you're done bam you're not bad and nine minutes yes okay when shibi goes live
6603920	6610160	please do tell me i will always recommend you guys go watch my gen mates another encryption this one
6610160	6614800	was supposed to be ledger because they are transmitting them because i'm an endurance streamer i'd
6614800	6620880	rather you support them we have nothing sometimes logic is not the only way to are you also an older
6621520	6628560	yes you said we had allies in the city bring me to them okay this is a beautiful quest
6630640	6634320	it's a beautiful quest and it has include revelation yes you play a much older etio i
6634320	6638000	think you're like 70 years old technically and you're like jumping about paragliding and stuff and
6638000	6644080	it's like really um they really stretch the old dates to make sure they could get them in this
6644640	6653680	um see you tonight when mercy rates into you honestly though gilf etio
6656640	6662800	brotherhood is etio and his prime for you for it he's like 42 or 41 i believe in this game
6663360	6665280	bit of an old man but hey
6666160	6675840	okay we're about to unlock the next sequence it's so good
6677760	6683440	so the map of roma is massive but there's guards everywhere so he's telling us if you use the
6683440	6688800	aqueducts you can move about real quick so we are going to use the aqueduct right now to get to
6688800	6695360	island tebarina and this is where the sassans are based on on the map in roma
6698880	6702960	when mercs aired in stream stroneys just finished the intro yapping of the story
6702960	6711600	honestly oh my god azerid it's so well on her 2.0 she's fantastic with all her yapping
6712160	6715840	i think someone said yep for corn and i was like well that's pretty smart i like that
6716400	6722080	i've heard a great deal about him from my cousin so he's not really in this at all
6723360	6728800	fabio i feel like he might have been dlc content or something he has two seats in this game
6729600	6740240	and yeah i don't know what i'd rather confuse i hope we will be free
6740640	6747920	she will occurs i wonder why i picked a zura
6755920	6760160	what are you also unaware that the borja have captured the apple have eaten
6761200	6762640	oh i do have lost the apple
6762960	6768160	so you do not know what goes on with our enemies do we at least have an underground here to work
6768160	6774400	with no underground network found our mercenaries are ensnared in elusiva la volpe doesn't even talk
6774400	6780320	to me we have girls working for us in a brothel frequented by cardinals oh my god is she be you're
6780320	6785840	in my game but the madame there is okay no not that rather attend parties than further of course
6786720	6793520	what about the city's thieves do they have a deal see but they refuse to talk to us i do not know why
6795680	6800400	what are you going to do to make some friends make some friends ah such a good line
6801520	6804880	because we're about to make three different allies of different districts we're about to
6804880	6808400	make friends with the thieves we're about to make friends with the holes we're about to make friends
6808400	6817040	with the mercenaries let's go it's a very good very good we also unlock notoriety in this as well

6845120	6850000	right we are going to do the eagle point right now just so we can kind of see what's going on around
6850000	6863520	island tibirina please do right so we are going to purposely do the thieves last the reason for
6863520	6869680	the thieves last is because it introduces notoriety so guards are going to start harassing us a bit
6869680	6877680	more um heralds are going to start talking about the devious acts that xio has committed and we're
6877680	6885760	also going to have witnesses that have falsified their testimonies you didn't falsify your testimony
6885760	6898320	to me we've also been introduced to the bank um where we can get money for investing in the city
6898320	6906000	every 20 minutes we will get our little 20 or cut from investing in these places um

6931680	6938720	um and do this quest line this is the campaign quest that requires florins in order to progress
6938720	6944880	however you can get a very i think you get roughly 2000 florins for doing this quest

6953840	6958800	that we're just gonna go kill the captain i hope he's not a coward because cowards run

7009200	7014400	attracted the attention of that guard over there which is such a shame no we attracted more attention

7087840	7094400	do i get up here um we are going to unlock what's called a leaping glove um which means we can do
7094400	7099200	very very big jumps uh unfortunately we can't do it at this section of the tower so we're gonna have
7099200	7107120	to drop down and reclaim it a different area we unlock that in sequence four i think at the end
7107120	7113520	of sequence four i can't remember um but it means we can jump things uh very easily and it makes

7201680	7208880	to check out sheepsters uh i'm just doing brotherhood for the rest of the day so have fun enjoyer and uh
7209520	7213760	uh oh this is the dead end i always forget the section uh normally recruitment's actually
7213760	7217920	spawning those sections and they're so annoying to try and get them do a barrel roll literally
7219760	7224720	yes oh i'm getting i'm getting shanked oh yeah oh yeah i'm getting picked up by thieves right this
7225680	7232000	this isn't a part of the lame ill for these skinny agile guys you must take out your small
7232000	7237680	weapon drapes swords as well work but um yes you had so you have to wait until they attack you
7237680	7241680	basically because they're so agile it's such a and then you can do that but
7244240	7248080	oh my god oh i don't want the guards to see me with this body we're just gonna go straight into
7248080	7258480	the memory to win the guards to make the bodies on me it was fun hanging yes have fun with sheepsters
7262080	7264640	bye bye thanks for hanging do you know where she is
7266400	7277600	multi-stream drift that means help in attack oh my god she got her look at her nose she got
7277600	7283680	a nose job look at that peak on that nose that's beautiful i will get her back
7285120	7292320	beautiful beautiful oh i really need to pee not gonna lie can i need to pee um maybe after
7292320	7298960	i finish this act we can go pee if you see top left it says like i've got 5 000 florans but i
7298960	7306080	need 2.5 it must be 3k for the banker uh sequence but that's not yet the banker comes later um
7306080	7311840	banker is a later act we are currently doing the lover the thief and the fighter
7314240	7321520	okay now that i've noticed i need to pee i really need to pee um uh brain psychology have you heard
7321520	7326880	of this uh do you want to maybe not i'm a bit rude we are just gonna run normally you can just
7326880	7334880	take a horse over this section but i find they've spawned a wee bit too much people to like walk
7334880	7339360	around and the horse really struggles to go in between like the streets especially if there's
7339360	7345120	narrow sections whereas etio can just straight up jump over uh so we will be just doing that
7347680	7355920	self-fulfilling prophecy i need to pee oh my god weapons if we all pee together at the same time
7355920	7361360	will we like affect the water like flush system why did you take out the sword etio i
7361840	7366720	he just poked him in that eye etio that was that was a lot oh
7368320	7372720	whoopsies i actually didn't mean to do that i literally just smacked my mouth i didn't mean
7372720	7378000	to kill him i'm sorry you're just trying to get your paycheck for your wife and kids and i've just
7378000	7386400	like literally made made her a widow oh don't really feel good about that one so this is a
7386400	7396240	borger zone it's actually really annoying do we do the borger zone before we do this
7397920	7402160	no we won't i can't be arsed we'll come back to this zone it's a lot easier when you have recruits
7402720	7408320	have you come for the whore are you here for the whore close enough are you dancing to me
7408320	7418400	it's what happens at football halftime oh i heard that hey let oh my god i don't remember this part
7418400	7423600	right again no way did you see the four things behind me soldiers are about to board this boat as
7423600	7432400	well okay you must loot the bodies oh i forgot to loot the body oh that's nice oh why are the freaking
7433120	7434000	now
7437360	7443280	energy pro okay so we're gonna look the bodies of the thieves because they normally have unique
7443280	7450000	items like elf and ivory 200 coins i thought it was a bit more than that uh yeah vlad then
7450000	7457360	paler coins um these items can be traded at shops for special items who goes there identify yourself
7457360	7468400	um and after completing this quest we unlock courtesans which can distract guards um they are
7468400	7476960	very vital to a later campy a later sequence uh actually the banker sequence which i previously
7476960	7483120	mentioned is when they are vital and a part of the gameplay you can also get favors done by them i
7483120	7490560	don't mean like that because they're courtesans i mean like so the base price to hire a group is 150
7490560	7498320	florans but if you wow them uh you can get a discount rate of 75 florans i've made that sound so
7498320	7505280	weird i know but it's the gameplay um the thieves if you upgrade them and impress them the thieves
7505280	7512640	will pick pocket naturally as you walk through clouds but it's a little bit more it's not awkward
7512640	7520880	to get the thieves favor they just have a few more unique um a few more unique things you have to do
7520880	7525200	i will explain it when we once we unlock it we're about to unlock it right now and it'll make more
7525200	7533280	sense um but we're basically making generic allies and soon we will make brotherhood allies which are
7533280	7539200	assassin allies and they will help your gameplay if you feel like you are a weak gamer or you're just
7539280	7545680	not there with it with timing and like things if the games are going too fast you're i can't keep up
7545680	7551040	this is the kind of game for you once you know what you're doing and get used to the controls
7551040	7558560	because once you unlock assassin recruits your life is so much easier from there it's it's bliss
7558560	7564320	it's a dream it's one of those games where not everything has to be on you in order to progress
7564320	7569680	and that these are my kind of games okay i don't want to feel stressed out uh if i don't hit that
7569680	7576960	you can quickly loot this little box that's on the balcony here uh 75 for a whole group of them
7576960	7582320	damn no wonder strongy only was 100 for the ace of wire but could you imagine if a con would let us
7582320	7591760	do that though i think we'd get kicked out i'm not gonna lie not that i'm insinuating anything
7591760	7603040	would occur in the booth but i feel like i do not know things may go hand quickly uh
7605920	7608560	oh is there sister and her mom they're in roma now
7612560	7614560	you cannot close i need your help
7615520	7620720	he he good morning good good morning good afternoon and good evening oh yes good morning
7620720	7623760	good afternoon no good morning good evening good afternoon there we go that's
7628640	7635280	so claudia is currently she be gone bum because she's about to run a grotella the blooming rose
7637040	7643120	why do these ladies have horns that was the style back and then they did their research these are
7643120	7648720	the hairstyles uh at the time good morning good evening and good night did i say the wrong way
7649600	7658320	sorry i'm a wee bit slow so we are now about to renovate this lovely location
7658880	7664880	and our sister claudia is going to run it and we now have favor with the courtesans
7666000	7672560	uh the rose that infuriate the blooming rose or something like that um there's a flag at the
7672560	7678800	top you can actually see it shimmering right now very slightly um but we're about to go insane
7680560	7688560	gentle called the blooming rose honestly though there are cons in Glasgow that would let you do xd
7690480	7693920	we were talking about like actually coming to physical cons
7693920	7700640	the most popular brothel in roma rose in fjord well invested here i keep a list of the skills
7700640	7706160	taught to my girls you're not gonna need them much think you could do better
7706160	7713120	no problem that's you the board job make it difficult for claudia's girls there are several
7713120	7720400	things you could do that would aid them i will keep that you can do side quest for the brotella
7720400	7729520	with your mum or whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa no no she assigns you quest
7731360	7736480	you do not do a quest with your mum in the game okay
7739920	7746080	apologies right okay so as i was talking about you can kind of level them up you can be given
7746080	7751440	assignments so right now it costs 150 florins to highlight uh to hire a group of girls um
7752640	7760080	send 10 guards distracted hide bodies um poison uh assassinate from blind spots
7760080	7764240	assassinate from behind smoke bomb we've not unlocked smoke bomb yet that comes later
7764240	7770320	but you can do these and gain favour with the factions and it makes your gameplay a lot easier
7771280	7780800	um right next we are going to actually factually do the mercenaries which is this one i'm just
7780800	7787920	highlighting it on the map so i don't get confused yes it is very far away um however
7789200	7796320	well we can just run there i think i can't take a horse and i cannot take the aqueduct because
7797040	7801920	as soon as you summon the horse you basically get walled off by the layout of the map which is fine
7801920	7807120	because we're literally in an area where people are supposed to be living and thriving and doing
7807120	7812400	things so yeah horses aren't really supposed to just roll all the way through though this is a lost
7812400	7816640	memory of uh the girl that got away but we're not gonna do it right now we're gonna do it at the
7816640	7823760	end i do apologize if you're really interested in the story uh what's her name chris christina
7823760	7832640	is her name um but that sad part comes in later uh it is a very unfavourable and sad memory so i
7832640	7839360	like leaving it to the end i'd rather just focus on the happy times only 500 more meters to go
7841200	7848480	christina i knew it was christina yeah this game as much as i'll meme about the render distance
7848560	7853920	like as soon as you get closer to someone i've just added so much time going this way whatever um
7855440	7860400	i'm like i'm trying to find the main freaking road but i can't find it it's really annoying
7860400	7864560	okay i found the main road and i'm about to go off it yippee oh i didn't mean to do that
7864560	7870960	swap to my sword oh this entire zone's red and i'm not strong enough to kill him we are
7871760	7877280	did we just run through the area to save us time to be honest
7879760	7885360	no no i'm not stopping you can't make me go away you stink stinky stinky guard
7886000	7891200	we'll come back once we unlock recruits um i can't get over your accent thanks respond in with it uh
7891760	7896880	if you'd like to visit Glasgow please do please support our economy because it's in absolute shambles
7896880	7904320	in the UK um maybe i should do that maybe i should like plan a trip if you ever came to
7904320	7907520	scotland and i'll be like you should go here and you should go here because i've been here and i've
7907520	7919760	been there um that'd be cute um the order is an acquired taste oh yeah stinky uh oh stinky
7919760	7926080	okay these are the french what do we think of the french what do we think of the french
7926080	7930880	we think they're fish they smell sorry there's like a football chant that's like what do we
7930880	7936160	think of the french i can't remember it but it's like what do we think of the french what do we
7936160	7944000	think of the french uh Glasgow's nice while you visited glad you didn't get stabbed the one of
7944000	7950080	the highest rate places to get stabbed however rate is one of the friendliest as well in europe
7950320	7956480	all of europe i don't know i don't know what it is what it is okay we made it we made it
7957120	7964240	we are about to meet Bartolomeo the owner i guess of the mercenary guild
7964240	7971920	come in come in i'll kill you if you don't
7972880	7980560	water check Bartolomeo you have to meet my wife Bianca oh no fantasy yeah Bianca's
7980560	7987040	his sword sorry his sword of his name is Bianca did you check behind the table okay that's a
7987120	7989440	reference to assassin's creed one just so you know
7993680	7999120	fantasy day ah don't mind if i do on chante
8000480	8004400	i still haven't harassed emi with my french uh scottish french accent
8006800	8012320	i should force her to make an ASMR french collab with me but i like purposely put my accent on
8012320	8021440	and she's just cringing in the corner don't forget to stretch yes uh i will need to educate you guys
8022640	8026880	on why we need to stretch our legs to make sure we don't have a bit of veins
8030240	8031120	our position is weak
8031520	8034960	if you can defeat them we can concentrate our forces on the french round
8043600	8047200	so i will educate you right now my lovely jubblies
8048480	8055680	did you know overwhelmingly the people that suffer from hemorrhoids which is a failure of a vein
8055680	8061360	in your booty hole is office workers because they sit down for long periods of time so i always
8061360	8067680	recommend stretching often or standing up we are all about to go for a pee break and i recommend
8067680	8073280	you all get up with me um sorry that i never explained that mission there if you kill only
8073280	8077920	the captain you get a hundred percent super simple easy and you can also pick up a flag on the way
8078880	8085920	uh so yes uh we desire to not have any issues with our booty holes so i will recommend we stretch
8085920	8091040	roughly every two hours um i've no idea how long i've been streaming for but we should probably
8091040	8096320	dozen um the guards will not harass you at this area it's super easy and you can pick up this
8096320	8106080	uh little treasure box it's phil yes um uh it's quite interesting like the knee uh this sounds
8106160	8112640	absolutely bizarre but the nature of hemorrhoids is quite interesting because it's literally just
8112640	8117440	what side am i supposed to climb up i can't get up there um it's literally just a vein in your
8117440	8122160	booty hole that's you know failed and there's nothing really more to it it's just like adios
8122160	8128240	i'm out and then that's what hemorrhoid is and you just get a cream and you know put it on your
8128240	8132400	butt and then it goes away it's really bizarre or if you're someone like it's a really a shame
8132400	8137440	i've like heard stories like people who suffer uh you need to like get on operation on your butt
8138160	8146880	but um yeah i don't know i just sorry i'm just vomiting about like biology and diagnosis and
8146880	8157280	stuff so yeah i am not expecting these topics a conversation and so i do apologize do we go left
8157360	8161120	or right here i actually i think yeah we were supposed to go left okay
8163840	8169840	the butthole though yes you you will have the healthiest booty hole uh enjoying my streams
8170400	8178240	because we will have healthy butts together uh okay first synchronize the viewpoint and then
8178240	8183360	ignite the board your tower do not ignite the board your tower first because the viewpoint
8183360	8189120	will not register and you will have to claim the tower all over again once you have done a tower
8189120	8194560	you never have to go back up it there is no uh treasure chest added on top of the tower there
8194560	8205200	are no flags added on top of the tower um yes i don't worry i love every second of your conversation
8205200	8212480	yeah i do like my conversational topic uh the game will always give you a way up fast if
8213360	8217280	they've kind of put you in a thingy because they literally leave you in the water after that
8217280	8223680	sequence and i was like okay then i guess we will call a horse very quickly or we'll steal a horse
8223680	8232240	but a really strange developmental fact is um depending on the horse's color depends on its
8232240	8240320	speed in the game the lighter and whiter the horses the slower it is and then obviously it goes up to
8240320	8244720	all the way to a black horse and a black horse is the fastest horse you can get in the game
8244720	8249760	i don't know why the developers did it like that um but i noticed it as soon as i like started
8249760	8254800	playing the game i was like huh why did they do this it seems like such a random thing um
8255680	8260080	but we're on a dark brown horse which is the second fastest so we got here lickety split
8260080	8266160	but if you can somehow memorize the speed of that horse when we get on a white one uh yeah
8266160	8271120	it'll be so slow in comparison now that the pope's dogs have fled we're talking about horses
8271120	8278960	still right yeah it's great play the game i will show you literally i don't know why the devs
8278960	8283360	don't know well when you approve the fact that's a true fact i don't that's group of things
8286800	8293440	oh yeah my all account got restricted and i had to pass like a 10 sec like 10 captures and i can't
8293440	8298400	be bothered doing it so my account's just restricted right now i'm so freaking lazy it like makes me do
8298400	8305120	like these 10 things over and over and i failed it the first time and i'm like go and stop playing
8306240	8312240	like you know full well i'm a human all i did was retweet someone artwork of me and then it
8312240	8320000	blocked my account again i've done it like three times now i keep getting it like horses are like
8320000	8329360	cars red car go first as you can see this board shows the ranks of our top warrior again uh same
8329360	8334480	thing as before if we improve the mercenaries they get cheaper i don't know if they get more effective
8334480	8339840	cannot prove that i don't know if they get more aggressive and successful you also have fun
8340560	8347120	now if you'll excuse me a bit silly in it yes it's silly brb you got walk home please do not get
8347120	8355200	snatched on your way home where is bartholomeo at the fight downstairs he has such an aggressive
8355200	8367200	view of the world the red ones go faster oh we're unlocking assassin mission contracts as well
8367200	8371680	you get some florns on the side super easy super quick if you unlock your assassin signals
8371680	8383120	and do these really fast not a problem we will do a pee break in about like five minutes time
8384160	8390320	okay now we are going to be able to utilize the aqueduct in order to get a lot closer because
8390320	8395680	if you see the meters it says we're 1000 meters away we go to the island tabirina that's the
8395680	8401520	closest we have unlocked to the thieves at the moment it wasn't kind of the market
8403760	8408960	is that that may be true i actually don't know if they get more plentiful the like higher you
8408960	8411680	under your the higher like tier you are with them
8416800	8422080	jeez it's almost just killed myself from that board there goodness all right they came out
8422080	8427440	there we are we do have to run for this but again unless i take this guy's horse you don't want
8427440	8436800	mine now yonkers thank you very much please okay out my way so this is the problem if the if you
8436800	8441680	gallop through crowds the horse will fall over but if you just sprint through crowds the horse
8441680	8450320	won't fall over um literally we commit grand theft horse say apologies to that guy he probably
8450320	8456240	spent thousands of florns on the horse and i've just ran away with it and you get to keep the horse
8457600	8460720	i've still not unlocked targets so we're not going to do that we're just going to swim
8460720	8468000	across the water really quick we the pirate ship always stays after you have done that i don't know
8468000	8476160	why but the asset does get reused in a Leonardo mission so it's not like a massive waste so we
8476160	8481440	are now currently trying to run out of range of the horse that's across the water because if we
8481440	8486320	call on it it's going to try and okay there we go we're out of range so we can spawn in the horse
8486320	8491920	at any point but uh it will try to come over from the other side of the water and it can't
8491920	8496800	so you need to go out of range to despawn it and then you can respawn it on the other side
8497680	8501360	fucking hell this horse is zooming my god what kind of hay did we give it
8502320	8511200	it's so fat why are we going so fat i need to help it oh my god that was dangerous that was
8511200	8514800	dangerous like didn't even got a helmet on he's not even got we crashed pads on
8516880	8521680	this is Lavalpe the owner of the tea skill horse doping honestly
8521920	8530000	i know the answer you always do you want to put my spies to work then go in aiding
8530000	8535200	Machiavelli no thank you the horse really gotta go fast should have made it blue like
8535200	8546240	panic bang bang a wee baggie to the horse we baggie is slang for
8549760	8556400	yeah i think you can you can get the rest from there he is an assassin not a traitor
8557200	8561360	i am not convinced a what a wee baggie means
8566240	8574640	care to accompany me so Lavalpe thinks that Machiavelli is a traitor to the assassin's guild
8574640	8582160	which is the reason why Lavalpe refuses to communicate with Machiavelli uh can i get a
8582160	8586000	horse please because this is going to take a while to get to the location we need to get
8586000	8593360	hello let's go right let's get out of the way of the humans because the humans are in the way
8594720	8601840	um after this we gain notoriety unfortunately which means there are gonna be
8602800	8606400	posters put up about us and they kind of pop up on the map a bit too
8606480	8608960	a bit too much and they're always like above
8611120	8616480	money oh yeah we're at six thousand that's not honestly that's not bad
8617520	8623200	um we are gonna try and get a crossbow bolt you can unlock a crossbow bolt just like the archers
8623200	8630160	but you need to pay for it and i think it's 13 000 florins and if you decide to invest in buildings
8630720	8637120	like boot i keep saying butchers like the blacksmith for example and it does like
8637760	8644720	it adds up over time but it kind of is a bit difficult it's better to like save your money
8644720	8653040	for the quest because you can easily defeat the section after oh you like my twitter picture yeah
8653040	8660800	yeah i totally made it myself i did not make it i didn't make it at all i yanked it
8662080	8670640	okay okay this pay attention look at his body and look at him holding his arm please make note of
8670640	8676480	this as his i know it sounds crazy but i'm gonna talk about reusing assets and how genius it is
8676480	8682880	in video game development okay so he is hunched over and he's holding his arm please keep this in
8682880	8692160	your mind okay let's see if i can shoot everyone right you first right you next right you next okay

8721120	8729920	quickly but basically you have to hide here and then we're gonna wait for a group to walk up and
8729920	8735440	then they will see that group there that's coming towards us we hide in that group and then that's
8735440	8740800	it we've done this section of the game but please make a note of his body how he's holding his arm
8740800	8745920	and he's kind of hunched over because i'm gonna show you a reused asset you might not know about
8745920	8750240	wait why why is that group highlighted hold on a minute am i supposed to be with the other there's
8750240	8758400	too many groups please please okay you okay i hate this bit because the tree gets in the way

8775600	8783680	and then tada oh excuse me you are right there and he's like that could have desynchronized

9898080	9902080	Did you guys pee and get water and stretch your legs instead?
9906080	9908080	I don't even drink energy drinks.
9908080	9912080	I'm eating meat and trying to play at the same time.
9916080	9918080	My mouth is stuffed full of meat.
9924080	9928080	Beecherbers when they're trying to do the most clippiest bait clip I've ever heard.
9930080	9932080	My mouth is so full of meat.
9932080	9936080	We got it. We know what game you're playing. It's fine.
9944080	9946080	I'm finishing it.
9946080	9948080	Sorry for the people that don't like mouth sounds. I apologize.
9952080	9956080	I actually can't remember what happens in this sequence.
9956080	9958080	My brain is blanking.
9962080	9966080	Well, it looks like I should have taken the aqueduct.
9966080	9968080	We're going into the castello.
9968080	9974080	We're about to go see Catherine of Forley.
9974080	9976080	Catherine of Forley.
9976080	9980080	She's currently stuck in a jail. She's got the jail.
9980080	9984080	The police in Scotland have got polis.
9984080	9988080	Actually, that's how you say it in Gaelic as well.
9988080	9990080	You say polis.
9990080	9992080	What are you eating?
9992080	9994080	I said a stick of meat.
9994080	9996080	It's like a pepper-rami.
9996080	10000080	But it's called a twizzle stick or something.
10000080	10002080	Oh, shit, I don't want to get in trouble.
10002080	10004080	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
10004080	10006080	Excuse me.
10006080	10008080	Come through.
10008080	10010080	That's what I didn't want to happen.
10010080	10014080	Because I'm literally just trying to get into a memory right now.
10014080	10018080	Excuse me. Pardon me. Didn't mean anything.
10018080	10023080	Well, you could've ignored me, but no, no, oh, are they still looking for me?
10023080	10026560	So that indicator means they're still looking, but they've not been coded to come down the
10026560	10027560	stairs or something?
10027560	10031680	Cause, yeah, they should've came down there, but they didn't.
10031680	10034080	Well I ain't complaining, I've never gotten in trouble, hee hee.
10034080	10035080	BOO!
10035080	10038080	Yeah, now, do you see that flashbang?
10038080	10039080	How does Haggis taste?
10039080	10041080	I actually really like it.
10042080	10044080	SHE HORROR FORLY!
10050080	10053080	I drinking lots of water to stop the neon.
10067080	10068080	What's Haggis?
10068080	10070080	Haggis is a meat dish.
10071080	10074080	I'll be free, your time will come, I swear it!
10074080	10076080	Keep your eyes on her eyes.
10076080	10078080	You're going to torture her.
10078080	10081080	You are here for Cesare and Rodrigo.
10082080	10084080	Girl spent in fire.
10084080	10086080	If we help her now while she is weak.
10086080	10089080	Haggis is a meat dish, a native national...
10089080	10091080	Let's kill Cesare and Rodrigo first.
10091080	10094080	It's not our national dish, I don't think.
10094080	10096080	Who goes there?
10096080	10099080	By the Pope.
10099080	10103080	I ate and I had a bit of water, so that didn't work.
10103080	10109080	It is, I believe, sheep liver and sheep lung mashed up.
10109080	10113080	And it's quite peppery, quite a peppery dish.
10113080	10115080	It's really nice.
10115080	10118080	You might have heard the phrase, neeps and tatis.
10118080	10120080	That means potatoes and turnip.
10120080	10122080	And it's just like a nice mash together.
10122080	10123080	It's really nice, I like it.
10123080	10127080	Okay, so this one's like, don't get caught, but I couldn't get...
10128080	10130080	What will they do?
10130080	10132080	Don't get detected later?
10132080	10134080	Because I actually don't even know how to do it.
10134080	10136080	So we're going to do it for the first time together.
10136080	10140080	I've never done this section without being caught.
10140080	10144080	I assume maybe if I had a crossbow and it can kill from afar and resupply.
10144080	10146080	Isn't Haggis a wee rodent?
10146080	10149080	Oh, aye, it's a wee animal.
10154080	10156080	Haggis is mainly pork, is it?
10158080	10165080	I don't think it's easily accessible, like, outside of the United Kingdom.
10165080	10169080	It is referred to as blood pudding.
10169080	10170080	Oh, no, that's black.
10170080	10172080	Black pudding is different.
10172080	10178080	For breakfast, we do like, it's a discus.
10178080	10183080	So on the way, a discus of, it's called black pudding,
10183080	10186080	but Americans refer to it as blood pudding.
10186080	10189080	But it is made of blood, so I do understand why they call it that.
10189080	10192080	It's just we call it, it just sounds a bit barbaric.
10192080	10197080	But at the same time, it's like, well, we are eating, you know what I mean?
10197080	10199080	No one cares.
10201080	10204080	Greetings, greetings.
10204080	10206080	You really say greens?
10208080	10210080	Alright, let's kill him from above.
10210080	10212080	Thank you very much.
10212080	10215080	We are going to have to come back on this.
10216080	10221080	Haggis is a savoury pudding containing sheeps,
10221080	10227080	sheeps pluck, minced with chopped onion, oatmeal, the spices and salt mixed with stock
10227080	10229080	and cooked with traditional, da da da da da.
10229080	10233080	I don't know how I could do that in the corner of my eye, but here you go.
10233080	10238080	I actually played this game so many times, I'm like completely sequenced out the wazoo.
10238080	10242080	But yeah, I'm a bit confused how you're supposed to do this section
10242080	10244080	without being caught without a crossbow.
10244080	10247080	I think we'll get access to the crossbow when we replay the memory.
10248080	10251080	Oh no, go away. See that's the thing.
10251080	10254080	Oh my god, no, no, no.
10254080	10261080	By the skin of our teeth, did that man not shoot?
10261080	10265080	Oh my gosh.
10265080	10271080	By the skill, by the skin of our teeth, by our gamer skills as well.
10271080	10273080	Yes, I give it to my gamer skills.
10274080	10276080	Oh my gosh.
10276080	10279080	Must have been the wind, literally.
10279080	10281080	Their brother and sister, by the way.
10290080	10292080	How it left so shut.
10292080	10295080	I'd rather like it open myself.
10297080	10301080	Have you talked to the Pope about the funds requested by my banker?
10301080	10303080	He is away from the Castello.
10303080	10306080	I do need some convincing when he returns.
10306080	10308080	That shouldn't be a problem.
10308080	10310080	Should it?
10310080	10312080	I wish that was me for real, for real.
10312080	10315080	Only it gets quite lonely here.
10315080	10318080	You and I spend so little time together.
10318080	10321080	Busy as you are with your other conquests.
10321080	10325080	Once I have secured the throne of Italia,
10325080	10330080	you are going to be my queen and your loneliness.
10330080	10332080	We'll be a thing of the past.
10332080	10334080	Ashight, baby.
10334080	10336080	Oh!
10336080	10338080	A bit of hair yonking.
10338080	10339080	We need to tag this up.
10339080	10341080	We need to tag this stream up to high heaven.
10341080	10345080	We've got hair yonking, we've got kissing, we've got bin best.
10345080	10348080	A lot of things going on.
10348080	10351080	I'm not to go up, I think I'm to swing to the side.
10351080	10353080	Yeah, surely.
10353080	10355080	Imagine if I went the wrong way.
10355080	10357080	Right now.
10357080	10359080	Hold B and then you just grab onto everything.
10359080	10362080	You can go down and speak things of it.
10362080	10364080	And what was it?
10364080	10369080	His ball was like one black thing shriveled up or something like that.
10369080	10372080	That Spaniard guy.
10372080	10375080	The Spanish were wild then.
10376080	10378080	To even get to that stage.
10378080	10381080	Not going to lie, not going to lie.
10381080	10383080	Who goes there?
10383080	10385080	Identify yourself.
10385080	10387080	What do we need to go up?
10387080	10389080	Square Sausage.
10389080	10391080	I miss square sausage.
10391080	10395080	If you didn't know, in Chicky Scotland for breakfast you do square sausage
10395080	10399080	and it's literally a square of sausage meat.
10399080	10401080	I wish it.
10401080	10404080	And I have it on a rolled way onion.
10404080	10406080	Didn't you just have his private...
10406080	10408080	I can't remember.
10418080	10423080	Whammin' on whammin' violence.
10423080	10426080	It can be.
10426080	10428080	You can put tomato sauce on it.
10428080	10433080	It's like tomato sauce, fried onion in square sausage on a roll.
10433080	10434080	Simple.
10434080	10436080	Simple, bruv.
10436080	10438080	Can I get more simple on that?
10438080	10440080	Right on the hip as well.
10440080	10442080	Excuse me.
10442080	10444080	Sorry, that actually really hurt.
10444080	10446080	I need a safe word.
10446080	10448080	That actually really hurt.
10448080	10450080	Please don't do that again.
10450080	10454080	Right, I'm pretty sure for this sequence if you time it right
10454080	10457080	you can be like not detected by the guards somehow.
10457080	10459080	Yeah, like literally he doesn't...
10459080	10466080	Yeah, so at least we know that for when we do play the 100% not detection segment.
10466080	10471080	And then there should be a guard to our left.
10471080	10476080	Well, we don't need to not be detected right now so it's fine.
10476080	10478080	The safe word is more...
10478080	10480080	What do you think is still it?
10480080	10484080	Should be in the safe word for a sheepskater.
10484080	10486080	Can you reach this water jug for me?
10486080	10489080	Okay, kill that guard first and then kill him.
10489080	10491080	And then that'll be how we won't get detected.
10491080	10493080	Surely.
10493080	10495080	Yay!
10495080	10497080	Castello crashing.
10497080	10499080	Paying a visit to the tailor.
10499080	10504080	Brown sauce and I'm not brown sauce fan sauce.
10504080	10508080	A bit of Harry Potter sauce with HP sauce.
10508080	10511080	It's tomato sauce or ketchup?
10511080	10513080	I'm gonna say something really dumb.
10513080	10520080	I don't know the difference between tomato ketchup and tomato sauce and tomato ketchup.
10520080	10523080	Ain't they the same? Aren't they the same?
10523080	10526080	Aren't they the same?
10526080	10531080	Phil Sinkfield, yes, we will be coming back to Fully Sink later thing right now.
10531080	10533080	Oh my god, that poor guy.
10533080	10536080	I didn't even know he was in here. I thought she was the only one here.
10537080	10542080	Brand? One has sugar, one doesn't.
10542080	10546080	I guess tomato sauce is probably what I like then.
10546080	10551080	This section can be a little bit finicky.
10551080	10553080	I love you so.
10553080	10556080	I want to sing it from the heavens.
10556080	10559080	Please, you must whisper it only to yourself.
10559080	10561080	If Cesare found out who knows what he would do.
10561080	10564080	These hoes ain't loyal.
10564080	10566080	He killed my husband.
10566080	10568080	Oh.
10568080	10571080	He killed my husband.
10571080	10573080	For real, for real.
10573080	10576080	I'm late for rehearsal. Farewell, my love.
10576080	10578080	No, ketchup has way more sugar than other ingredients.
10578080	10580080	Oh my god, not kidding.
10580080	10582080	She got a point. Ketchup has a ton of sugar.
10582080	10585080	Okay, whatever the sugary one was, I like it.
10585080	10587080	Brain says yum.
10587080	10590080	We shall see how it feels when the shoe is on the other foot.
10590080	10592080	Oh.
10592080	10594080	She's playing.
10594080	10596080	She said, guess what?
10596080	10599080	I'm not the only one that's going cheating around here.
10602080	10604080	He loves me.
10604080	10608080	Oh, she's like actually animating the flower and stuff.
10610080	10612080	Hello.
10612080	10615080	Imagine counting flowers and someone just goes,
10615080	10617080	wow.
10619080	10621080	Oh my god, I think I would have a heart attack.
10626080	10628080	I would have enjoyed this.
10628080	10630080	Guards.
10630080	10632080	Jump on you and say hello.
10632080	10634080	That's what happens in the ASMR booth.
10634080	10637080	What happens in the booth stays in the booth.
10637080	10640080	I see that premium pass around your neck.
10640080	10642080	I'm jumping on you.
10642080	10644080	Thanks for supporting me.
10644080	10646080	I just have to wait for these guys to attack
10646080	10648080	because they are such a nightmare.
10648080	10652080	Literally, it's just so much faster to let them attack
10652080	10654080	and then...
10656080	10658080	Right.
10658080	10660080	Oh, I think I just net.
10662080	10664080	The jump scare.
10665080	10667080	Foxy jump scare.
10668080	10670080	Princesses from Kessels now.
10671080	10673080	Ora, ora, ora.
10673080	10675080	Right, so this is really awkward.
10675080	10679080	If Lucretia gets away, like back to that starting station,
10679080	10681080	she will spawn out of bounds
10681080	10683080	and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it
10683080	10685080	and you have to restart this section again.
10685080	10687080	It's so annoying.
10687080	10691080	Thankfully, the last few times I've played this game,
10691080	10695080	it's not happened, but when it does happen, it's so annoying.
10695080	10698080	Oh my god, it's so annoying, Lucretia.
10699080	10701080	If you can get...
10701080	10703080	Excuse me, I wasn't even putting her down
10703080	10706080	and you just whapped me with that frickin' weapon.
10706080	10708080	Stop it!
10708080	10710080	You're upsetting me!
10710080	10712080	Don't upset me!
10712080	10714080	Oh my god, please do not do a finishing move
10714080	10717080	if she gets away because I was busy doing a finishing move
10717080	10719080	to look really good.
10719080	10722080	The passing was, your hand was finished
10722080	10725080	and their memory's erased.
10725080	10728080	Oh no, the tombstone's erased.
10733080	10735080	See, she does that.
10735080	10738080	See, if she jumps out, you have to go grab her.
10738080	10741080	However, if the people are attacking you,
10741080	10745080	then she'll wait on the side patiently for you to kill them.
10745080	10747080	Oh my god, is she actually getting away?
10747080	10749080	I'm getting nervous.
10749080	10752080	Stop it, Lucretia!
10752080	10755080	Hen, Hen, calm down, let me just kidnap you.
10755080	10758080	I mean, come on, come on, let me just kidnap you, okay?
10758080	10760080	Let me just kidnap you.
10760080	10762080	Shhh!
10762080	10764080	You like it really, come on.
10764080	10766080	Your man's not gaining any attention
10766080	10769080	and look at me, I'm picking you up, I'm throwing you a boot.
10769080	10771080	This is exactly what you're wanting, Hen.
10771080	10773080	Lucretia, didn't you fight that?
10773080	10775080	Didn't you actually fight that?
10776080	10782080	Okay, shhh, that's right, that's right, just accept it.
10784080	10787080	Shhh, this is so weird, I'm sorry.
10790080	10792080	My words are wasted.
10792080	10793080	Hippocrita!
10793080	10794080	No!
10794080	10796080	No, come on.
10797080	10799080	Okay, we did it.
10800080	10802080	Hippocrita!
10803080	10805080	Just kidnap me, Strony.
10810080	10812080	Crank sale, those are some big words.
10812080	10814080	You're not supposed to say that stuff.
10814080	10816080	Pip sweat detected.
10817080	10820080	Strony be taking tips from Mercy.
10820080	10822080	That's enough out of you.
10826080	10828080	He's smart, I can't read him.
10829080	10831080	Okay.
10832080	10833080	Do not be detected.
10833080	10835080	Again, another do not be detected.
10835080	10837080	But there's two guards literally dead ahead.
10837080	10839080	How am I not to be detected by them
10839080	10841080	when we play this for people?
10841080	10843080	Did they come in here?
10843080	10845080	No, this cannot be.
10845080	10847080	Did they actually come in here?
10849080	10852080	Okay, one gets his...
10855080	10857080	No, okay.
10858080	10860080	How am I supposed to deal with two of them at once
10860080	10862080	when we do it for real?
10864080	10866080	Eh, you better calm down, hen.
10866080	10868080	I'm rescuing you, Christina.
10868080	10870080	Then you get on at me about taking so long.
10870080	10872080	What are you doing?
10873080	10875080	Catarina.
10876080	10878080	I can't wait to hear your ASMR streams.
10878080	10881080	Oh, it's just absolute word vomit, I promise you.
10881080	10883080	Absolutely nothing makes sense.
10883080	10885080	My accent gets a little off the wee bit when I whisper,
10885080	10887080	but it's not really a big deal.
10887080	10889080	Like, I can make it...
10889080	10891080	I can enhance.
10894080	10896080	All about that?
10897080	10898080	Yes, yes, yes.
10898080	10899080	I know.
10899080	10901080	You gave me your hole, so I'd protect you.
10901080	10902080	It's... oh.
10902080	10903080	Hello.
10903080	10904080	Bye-bye.
10904080	10905080	Hello.
10905080	10907080	Bye-bye.
10908080	10911080	I do be a really skilled assassin, honestly.
10911080	10913080	Ready?
10917080	10919080	Where?
10922080	10924080	He's just like me for real, for real.
10924080	10926080	He literally went...
10928080	10930080	Where actually is the auditorium?
10930080	10932080	Confirmed.
10933080	10935080	Never do that to me again.
10936080	10939080	Man, they didn't even let her put on her dress and stuff.
10939080	10941080	It's all torn at the bottom.
10941080	10943080	Oh, also, you can walk on barrels.
10943080	10945080	If you wanted to know that,
10945080	10948080	you can like jump up on barrels while carrying people.
10950080	10953080	It's just like a silly little goofy thing, but I like it.
10954080	10955080	Okay.
10955080	10957080	We pop you down there, pet the eagle,
10957080	10959080	and then we just give a wee stabby stabby the eagle,
10959080	10961080	all for you, mate.
10961080	10964080	And we just pick up the lady again.
10964080	10966080	And then basically...
10966080	10968080	If you pop her down in the middle,
10968080	10972080	I think you can access both gates without losing distance.
10972080	10976080	It will warn you against distance if you get too far away from her,
10976080	10978080	but...
10980080	10983080	No, I was gonna walk away.
10983080	10986080	I was gonna walk away and you forfeited your life.
10987080	10990080	How could you be such a silly...
10990080	10993080	I think we actually might have to move her over.
10993080	10996080	Whoa, did you guys see what I just saw?
10997080	10998080	Oh, leave me alone.
10998080	10999080	No, no, you don't see me.
10999080	11000080	I'm just going up the stairs.
11000080	11001080	I'm just a tourist.
11001080	11002080	I'm a visor, okay?
11002080	11004080	I'm a visor of the...
11005080	11007080	I thought I was gonna desync there.
11007080	11008080	I got scared.
11008080	11010080	I thought I was gonna desync there.
11011080	11014080	I saw her panties.
11014080	11015080	Shhh.
11015080	11018080	And I didn't even have to pay anything.
11018080	11020080	I saw them for free.
11020080	11022080	Shhh.
11022080	11024080	Wait, can that guy see me again?
11024080	11025080	Oh!
11025080	11028080	I think we're gonna have to do the old ear assassination.
11031080	11032080	Excuse me, sir.
11032080	11034080	I just moved over to do an ear assassination.
11034080	11035080	Thank you.
11038080	11040080	The audio is strange again.
11040080	11042080	It better not be.
11045080	11047080	Why?
11047080	11048080	Why?
11048080	11051080	Literally nothing has changed.
11053080	11055080	I'm gonna tab in and out of the game multiple times.
11055080	11058080	Okay, so it's gonna pause and then open back up
11058080	11061080	and pause and open back up.
11065080	11067080	There's a static noise.
11067080	11069080	Sound like a static review.
11070080	11072080	If I have to close the game again,
11072080	11074080	I will.
11076080	11078080	A desync warning.
11078080	11081080	Like, it sounds perfectly fine for me.
11082080	11084080	Still there?
11085080	11086080	Shhh.
11091080	11094080	Do I have to play this whole section again if I quit right now?
11094080	11096080	It's still buzzing.
11096080	11098080	Do you know what buzzing means in Scots?
11098080	11100080	It means you're really having to play it now.
11101080	11104080	A feature where I know you can just restart the audio capture?
11104080	11106080	I mean, wait.
11106080	11109080	Hold on, controversial move, I know.
11111080	11113080	How does that sound?
11114080	11116080	Does that sound normal?
11118080	11122080	I am now capturing my desktop audio instead of the game.
11123080	11126080	Okay, I can now, you're literally gonna hear
11126080	11130080	if one of the girls DM me on Discord, that's the only thing.
11132080	11134080	Okay, let's get across the bridge.
11134080	11136080	Risky, I know you're all gonna know that.
11136080	11140080	I've arranged another ASMR collab.
11140080	11144080	Like, literally 30 minutes before the stream started.
11144080	11147080	I burst into someone's DMs on Twitter.
11147080	11150080	And I was like, hey girl, do you wanna add me?
11150080	11153080	And then I was talking through my ASMR collab.
11153080	11155080	And I've already planned it.
11155080	11159080	It's not a big ASMR, it goes on her channel and all that jazz, but yeah.
11160080	11163080	Okay, we have a timer, we basically just have to survive.
11163080	11167080	So this is where you can get the serial killer achievement again,
11167080	11169080	but it gets a bit iffy.
11170080	11173080	It's not the best, I will mess up.
11173080	11178080	And where the enemies go away, citizen, I don't wanna kill anymore.
11180080	11182080	I'm gonna try and kill the wee guys first,
11182080	11186080	because they grab me like that and ruin my streak.
11189080	11191080	Okay, sorry, I'm focusing.
11191080	11194080	See when they grab you, it takes you out of your kill streak advantage.
11194080	11196080	And there's Lancers as well, I can see that Lancer.
11196080	11198080	I'm gonna try and take him out in the kill streak.
11199080	11200080	Okay.
11201080	11204080	I'm trying to get the Lancer and it keeps all into the other guys.
11206080	11207080	Come on.
11207080	11208080	Wee guy next.
11209080	11211080	Armor guy next, I guess.
11211080	11214080	He's probably the best, but okay, I can't break his armor.
11214080	11216080	So I'm just gonna go for the wee guy.
11217080	11218080	Okay.
11219080	11221080	We're getting there, we're getting there, 30 more seconds.
11221080	11223080	Do not grab me.
11223080	11224080	I hate when they grab me.
11224080	11226080	Oh no, no, no, not the horse.
11226080	11228080	Not the horse, not the horse.
11230080	11232080	I said I'm hiding from the horse, get me in the hay bale.
11234080	11236080	I'm scared of the horses.
11236080	11238080	I actually don't know how to take down horse guys.
11240080	11241080	Ouch.
11241080	11243080	Yeah, this is why I don't like the horse guy.
11243080	11246080	We got seven seconds, we just need to not get hit.
11246080	11249080	Because we can run away in two seconds.
11249080	11252080	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
11253080	11254080	Wee.
11257080	11258080	Oh my god.
11259080	11264080	Okay, so in this sequence, you just need to get out a range of the yellow on the map.
11264080	11270080	If you come on the roof, you can basically run along it as much as you need.
11270080	11277080	Or if you don't like rooftop scaling, there is boats down to the left where you can get out a range.
11278080	11279080	Down, down, down.
11281080	11283080	Bruh, bruh, get off.
11284080	11285080	My roof, no.
11286080	11292080	And then if we disappear in the water maybe, I think we can hide in the water.
11293080	11295080	You can like literally hide in the water.
11296080	11298080	I'm a call fish, let's go.
11299080	11300080	Can they see me?
11301080	11307080	Physically, yes they can see me, but game development wise?
11307080	11310080	No, they can't, so I enjoyed that.
11310080	11312080	Do that again, more game please.
11313080	11315080	Okay, we're gonna kill this guy.
11315080	11318080	Sorry, I'm sorry mate, your time is up.
11319080	11320080	Oh, I forget.
11321080	11324080	Okay, if you scare away, you won't be able to...
11324080	11328080	Right, we're gonna go for this poster just because I don't want guards to attack you on site.
11329080	11332080	If you are the highest notoriety, they will attack you.
11333080	11337080	Oh, the poster is down here, I have been fooled.
11337080	11339080	The egg is on my face.
11342080	11351080	We need to now go back to the island hideout because Caterina's forces are there.
11352080	11360080	And then we can unlock assassin recruits and then we're really gonna get into the meat of the game and I love it.
11360080	11363080	And everything is so cool, everything's so awesome.
11365080	11368080	We're just gonna, alright, here we go, yank.
11368080	11371080	He said enough, I yanked him off for heart, enough.
11372080	11373080	Enough.
11374080	11375080	Is it enough?
11376080	11378080	Don't you not want to give more?
11382080	11385080	Okay, this is the only problem when navigating with a horse.
11385080	11391080	You have to, you're like stuck to using whatever roads you've passed out and it gets really...
11404080	11407080	Why would you bother just going down to it, folks?
11408080	11410080	If you come on the roof, should you...
11412080	11415080	I never even said that, that was you that said that.
11415080	11418080	Normally I'm the one coming out with the outrageous...
11419080	11422080	I just whistled for the horse whilst purchasing the bank.
11425080	11427080	Hey, horse, can you come out here?
11427080	11429080	Thanks, appreciate it.
11429080	11430080	Like, oh, okay.
11434080	11438080	Oh, we made 1.5 Florence.
11438080	11440080	That's pretty good.
11440080	11444080	I don't think we're gonna get the crossbow before the section that I'm hoping to get it by.
11445080	11447080	I don't know why we lost all our money.
11447080	11448080	Don't know how it happened.
11448080	11450080	Something, something don't gamble at home, people.
11452080	11454080	But may have lost all our money in that.
11455080	11457080	Right, where is the bridge?
11457080	11459080	The bridge is over here, okay.
11461080	11463080	Gotta stay on them peasants.
11464080	11467080	Horse is the first customer of the store, for real, for real.
11467080	11469080	Munching on that hay.
11473080	11475080	Okay, we have made it to the island.
11477080	11480080	Never gamble with your own money, gamble with someone else's, that's terrible.
11480080	11482080	Don't gamble at all.
11483080	11484080	Save that mule.
11485080	11486080	I could not find him.
11487080	11489080	Get yourself a wee fizzy juice from the corner shop.
11489080	11491080	Maybe a wee bakery, a wee scone.
11491080	11493080	To treat those things.
11495080	11497080	The bank is in the room.
11499080	11500080	Okay.
11504080	11505080	Wow.
11506080	11508080	It's normally outcast.
11509080	11510080	Very odd indeed.
11511080	11512080	What a waste.
11512080	11518080	So the Volpe thinks that Marquee Valley tipped off Cesare to leave the castle.
11519080	11521080	So we're all suspicious.
11523080	11525080	Cesare commands a massive army in Romania.
11526080	11527080	You would never reach it.
11528080	11529080	I say we work here.
11529080	11530080	Loma.
11530080	11533080	They rode the Borja's influence while restoring our own.
11534080	11535080	And in fact,
11535080	11537080	I'm gonna start right now.
11537080	11538080	Yes.
11538080	11539080	We're doing it.
11546080	11547080	We're doing it.
11547080	11548080	We're about to get the brotherhood.
11548080	11549080	Come on, reflings.
11549080	11551080	I want to turn you guys into assassins.
11552080	11554080	I want to turn you to deadly weapons.
11555080	11558080	The Borja robbed everything from the people to maintain power.
11559080	11560080	What do you intend to do?
11561080	11563080	You will recruit him to our cause.
11563080	11564080	You cannot be serious.
11564080	11566080	To win this war, Marquee Valley.
11566080	11567080	We need loyal soldiers.
11567080	11568080	Come on, reflings.
11569080	11570080	You'd let me draft you, right?
11572080	11574080	All right, let's get drafted.
11576080	11578080	I'm gonna be the combat medic on the battlefield.
11578080	11580080	Okay, I'm healing you guys on the battlefield.
11581080	11582080	With my...
11583080	11585080	Oh, my God.
11585080	11587080	The cutscene took so long that...
11587080	11588080	Wait!
11589080	11591080	Whoa, I've never seen this happen before.
11591080	11594080	To recruit spawned and the cutscene took so long,
11594080	11596080	they both died in the instants.
11596080	11598080	Oh, my God.
11598080	11600080	All right, she's still alive.
11600080	11601080	Let's save her.
11601080	11602080	Oh, my God.
11602080	11603080	It's Shrek and...
11603080	11606080	No, no, no, no, we've just attracted more guards.
11606080	11607080	This is terrible.
11607080	11609080	She has incredibly low health.
11610080	11611080	Oh, goodness me.
11611080	11613080	Oh, goodness gravy.
11614080	11615080	Please don't perish.
11615080	11616080	I hope she doesn't perish,
11616080	11617080	cause we're actually gonna have to...
11617080	11619080	Okay, she didn't perish, thank goodness.
11620080	11621080	Already sold my life.
11621080	11622080	One!
11622080	11624080	What did you sell your life to?
11626080	11627080	Sin?
11629080	11631080	It's a lady assassin.
11631080	11634080	You'll never guess what I do to the lady assassin.
11634080	11635080	Okay, I'm gonna open up the map
11635080	11637080	and the map will tell us where the next recruit is.
11637080	11639080	So we can go recruit this person.
11641080	11646080	And now we are about to unlock assassin recruit signals,
11646080	11648080	which means in the middle of a fight
11648080	11651080	we can literally ask the game to help us.
11651080	11653080	And there's also a really fun minigame
11653080	11655080	where you can level them up
11655080	11657080	and make them even stronger to the point
11657080	11660080	where they can fight incredibly strong enemies.
11660080	11664080	And it is so satisfying watching their health bars go up.
11664080	11666080	Oh, look, I have it already, actually.
11666080	11670080	I'm gonna use it for this citizen.
11670080	11673080	If I can get to them in time before they perish.
11676080	11677080	Here we go.
11677080	11678080	Oh, it's another lady.
11678080	11682080	Oh my God, we're like doing all ladies in this assassin group.
11682080	11684080	Oops, my bad.
11684080	11686080	You can't really...
11686080	11688080	Oh, okay.
11688080	11689080	Hold on, let me go.
11689080	11690080	Let me get up.
11690080	11691080	Okay, we're...
11691080	11692080	Oh my gosh.
11692080	11694080	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
11694080	11696080	More like the sisterhood.
11696080	11697080	Am I right?
11697080	11698080	Ha ha.
11701080	11703080	Hopefully we can get a few guys in here.
11703080	11704080	We need to repopulate Roma.
11704080	11705080	You know what I'm saying?
11705080	11706080	Yum yum yum yum.
11707080	11709080	Let's unlock the doctors
11709080	11711080	because we can get more money in general.
11712080	11714080	Strong door calls for aid.
11715080	11717080	Me on Christmas like.
11718080	11719080	Okay.
11720080	11721080	So...
11721080	11722080	Lead...
11722080	11724080	What did he say?
11725080	11727080	I don't think I've ever heard that.
11727080	11730080	I've got a new lead based cure for syphilis.
11730080	11733080	I didn't know that was in the game.
11733080	11735080	That's outrageous.
11735080	11739080	Right, we're gonna go pick up this other assassin recruit
11739080	11741080	because they're like 100 meters away.
11741080	11744080	That's absolutely hilarious.
11744080	11749080	And we're also gonna send one of our assassin recruits away on a mission
11749080	11752080	which is how you level up the assassins
11752080	11755080	and you get a stupendous amount of money for it.
11757080	11761080	So I get 650 florins for 6 minutes I send this person away for.
11761080	11763080	So this is your biggest money maker
11763080	11765080	sending your assassin recruits away.
11766080	11768080	So we might be able to get the crossbow ball
11768080	11771080	if I dilly dally and do a few save quest things.
11771080	11773080	Or we can just rush through.
11773080	11775080	It's not really rushing because
11775080	11778080	it's just playing the campaign but yeah.
11779080	11781080	I'll have to say nothing is true.
11781080	11784080	Everything is permitted for real.
11784080	11788080	I'm training my reeflings to become weapons of destruction.
11788080	11790080	Where's the citizen?
11790080	11792080	Oh, they're already fighting.
11792080	11795080	Oh, the citizen might die.
11797080	11800080	Oh, why is this building so tall?
11800080	11802080	Oh, can I get them?
11802080	11803080	Can I save you?
11803080	11805080	I'm coming, I'm coming.
11805080	11807080	I'm helping, I'm helping.
11807080	11809080	Okay, we got it, we got it, we got it.
11809080	11810080	Okay, good.
11810080	11812080	Oh no, there's more guards that have come in.
11812080	11814080	Oh, I don't know how low his HP is.
11814080	11818080	The recruits are so bad at the game as well.
11818080	11820080	Oh, I'm so bad at the game.
11820080	11823080	Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
11823080	11825080	Oh, come on, you can do it.
11825080	11826080	Okay.
11827080	11828080	Oh, we did it.
11828080	11830080	I instantly you want to pick up the recruit
11830080	11833080	because it gets rid of any guards that are nearby.
11834080	11836080	Mere gracia, Amiko.
11840080	11842080	Weapons of destruction.
11842080	11845080	Achievements, brotherhood.
11847080	11851080	If we had gamer score, we'd probably have like 200 venerals.
11851080	11853080	Oh, these are the Borja zones that we've liberated.
11853080	11857080	We've done three places, so we're allowed to have three recruits.
11857080	11862080	We've done four places, excuse me, so we're allowed to have four recruits.
11862080	11864080	I literally just remembered.
11865080	11870080	We can go to the main quest, which is down here.
11870080	11873080	There's actually someone we can recruit over here.
11874080	11877080	Nah, we'll go to the main quest and we'll pick up recruits on the way.
11877080	11878080	We've got a fill bar of recruits.
11878080	11881080	Unfortunately, they're very weak, so it's not very good.
11881080	11883080	I'm chasing after you, my recruit.
11885080	11889080	It's not very good to send them to battle
11889080	11891080	without kind of leveling them up first
11891080	11895080	because your recruits can perish in a fight, unironically.
11897080	11901080	Yeah, your assassins can die, it's very dangerous.
11905080	11907080	Across the bridges are our first mission.
11907080	11911080	These missions are all based around calling your assassin recruits in,
11911080	11915080	but the bar does take exactly 60 seconds to refresh
11915080	11918080	from when they disappear, not from when you call them in,
11918080	11920080	from when they disappear off the map.
11921080	11926080	And some of the missions, they take a hot second.
11926080	11929080	It's good to get multiple bars of assassin recruits,
11929080	11932080	so the more Borgia towers you destroy, the more recruits you're allowed,
11932080	11940080	and you've got a maximum of three bars, so six Borgia towers.
11940080	11942080	Where the heck am I going?
11942080	11944080	Oh, this one, I remember.
11944080	11948080	Hello, sorry to swing in about that over this very sad scene.
11949080	11950080	Mafato!
11950080	11953080	This is another multiplayer character that we kill.
11953080	11958080	We must follow the whores,
11958080	11961080	so they will point to where we need to go,
11961080	11964080	but I have played this game many a time now,
11964080	11967080	so you can just keep running in general.
11967080	11972080	Running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running.
11972080	11975080	Yeah, we do have our recruits ready to assassinate this guy,
11975080	11979080	and we should get a tidy sum of money for doing so.
11983080	11985080	I've actually never tried to break this sequence
11985080	11988080	and go outside of what the girls point you to.
11992080	11994080	I've called my recruit.
11994080	11995080	I don't know where she is.
11995080	11996080	She's taking her sweet time, right?
11996080	11997080	There you go.
11997080	11998080	Get him!
11999080	12001080	And then with 100% of that,
12001080	12002080	I'm going to shower.
12002080	12004080	Hold on, let me pause the stream for you.
12005080	12006080	I'm teasing.
12006080	12007080	Enjoy your shower.
12007080	12009080	Don't forget to do your belly button and behind your ears.
12009080	12011080	A lot of people forget.
12011080	12013080	And make sure you soap all over,
12013080	12015080	even on your booty hole.
12015080	12018080	Soap cleans itself due to the nature of it.
12021080	12024080	Not that you're expecting a visitor anytime soon, are you?
12029080	12030080	Do you get a lot of money if you loot?
12030080	12033080	No, you don't get anything if you loot the multiplayer.
12033080	12035080	Ooh, new recruit, let's get it.
12039080	12040080	No, they're fighting.
12040080	12042080	Stop fighting before I even get there.
12042080	12043080	My goodness.
12043080	12044080	Stop it!
12044080	12045080	Stop it!
12046080	12047080	I'm coming to hell.
12047080	12048080	Give me a second.
12048080	12049080	Let me cook.
12049080	12050080	Oh, my God.
12050080	12052080	I've just invited even more guards to come over.
12053080	12054080	Oh, please don't.
12054080	12056080	I don't know how damaged they is.
12056080	12058080	Please don't do a cutscene.
12059080	12062080	There's too many enemies around right now for this.
12064080	12065080	Oh, oops.
12066080	12068080	I am actually going to pick up these bodies
12068080	12070080	and put them in the hay bale
12070080	12072080	because if you put five in a hay bale,
12072080	12074080	you do a cortisol challenge.
12074080	12075080	I'm just going to do this now,
12075080	12076080	so I'm not going to talk to them.
12076080	12078080	I'm literally going to save his life
12078080	12079080	and then just be like, excuse me,
12079080	12080080	I'm just trying to hide the evidence
12080080	12082080	of what we've just committed together.
12089080	12090080	Mother Mary.
12090080	12092080	No, not the sword.
12092080	12093080	The body.
12093080	12094080	No, the body.
12094080	12095080	Thank you.
12096080	12098080	No requiesce de parti.
12101080	12103080	One more body should do it.
12103080	12105080	No, not the weapon.
12105080	12106080	The body.
12107080	12109080	Taking out the trash.
12109080	12110080	Taking out the trash.
12112080	12113080	Okay, there we go.
12114080	12115080	You know what always bothered me?
12115080	12116080	When you kill some evil bloke
12116080	12119080	and then Exo is cradling like a babysitter recipe,
12120080	12121080	he has...
12121080	12123080	Whoa, what was that?
12123080	12125080	Was that scaffolding in that cutscene?
12127080	12129080	The camera is so good in this game.
12129080	12130080	Like it's so good.
12132080	12136080	Do you guys remember the asset repeating?
12137080	12140080	I'm going to show you an asset that was repeated.
12140080	12142080	It's right in this next quest.
12143080	12145080	So remember how he was holding his arm
12145080	12147080	and he was injured?
12147080	12149080	Well, guess what?
12149080	12151080	This is where they reused the asset.
12151080	12153080	On this little crying kid.
12153080	12154080	Don't worry.
12154080	12156080	There's not a random kid crying in your headset.
12156080	12157080	It's part of the game.
12159080	12162080	This is a shrunken down version
12162080	12164080	of that guy that got injured.
12164080	12165080	Not at this stage,
12165080	12166080	but it's the same clothes and all that.
12166080	12168080	And when he walks away, you can see it.
12169080	12171080	Okay, so stare at him.
12172080	12174080	We know you use reused assets.
12174080	12176080	You be soft, we know.
12177080	12179080	This is the next one.
12181080	12182080	Sleepy.
12184080	12185080	You are scary,
12185080	12187080	but you look very brave.
12191080	12193080	Right, now watch him walk away.
12195080	12197080	You think you can distract me, video game?
12197080	12199080	I'm on to your secrets.
12201080	12203080	You might as well have me on the dev team.
12203080	12204080	Look at this walk!
12205080	12206080	He's injured!
12206080	12208080	I can see it!
12208080	12209080	You can't hide that from me.
12209080	12211080	I've played this game far too many times.
12211080	12213080	That's just the injured thief.
12213080	12215080	Asset reused.
12215080	12218080	You can't get away from me.
12219080	12220080	Honestly,
12220080	12222080	I wonder if there is behind the scenes development
12222080	12223080	of Brotherhood,
12223080	12225080	because I actually haven't consumed any of that.
12225080	12226080	And if there is,
12226080	12229080	I know what I'm doing the moment I go to bed.
12230080	12233080	Among other things after looking at Marshmallow,
12233080	12235080	hehehehehe.
12236080	12238080	Okay, we do have two assassin signals,
12238080	12239080	which is really good,
12239080	12243080	but I should probably send the recruits away
12243080	12244080	just to get stronger,
12244080	12245080	but not right now,
12245080	12246080	because we're in the middle of a secret.
12246080	12248080	I'm just going to start upgrading stuff
12248080	12249080	as I find them.
12252080	12253080	Yeah.
12253080	12256080	Injured thief number 312.
12260080	12261080	Okay, camera angle, please.
12261080	12262080	Ow!
12262080	12264080	I just bumped into those guards.
12264080	12266080	They literally could have reprimanded me for doing that,
12266080	12267080	but I guess not.
12267080	12269080	Right, we have two assassin signals,
12269080	12270080	which is good.
12270080	12272080	Actually, I'm going to send them a fight
12272080	12274080	to get some experience,
12274080	12277080	because I need to get them strong.
12279080	12282080	So, we're just going to watch them do their thing.
12282080	12284080	Hopefully they'll hurry up and get some XP.
12286080	12287080	Yep.
12287080	12288080	Take your time.
12288080	12289080	There you go.
12289080	12291080	They get XP every time you call them
12291080	12293080	into a battle or send them in missions.
12293080	12294080	It's not a problem.
12294080	12295080	There we go.
12295080	12296080	And they've respawned,
12296080	12297080	so it's all good.
12297080	12299080	We will keep another signal
12299080	12301080	to do this mission, though,
12301080	12302080	because to get 100%,
12302080	12304080	you have to send your signal
12304080	12305080	to kill the person.
12305080	12306080	Again, another multiplayer character,
12306080	12308080	which is why they're so designed.
12312080	12314080	I can't really remember.
12314080	12316080	He looks behind you
12316080	12318080	on the bridge a lot,
12318080	12320080	and I like to write on corners.
12320080	12322080	It's quite funny, actually.
12325080	12327080	You don't ever use the recruits.
12327080	12328080	Are you joking?
12328080	12329080	That's the best part about this game.
12329080	12330080	If you suck at video gaming,
12330080	12332080	you can literally just call in the recruits
12332080	12334080	to do everything for you.
12335080	12338080	He should start running in a second.
12339080	12340080	No, around the corner he runs,
12340080	12342080	because we're to go over there.
12348080	12349080	He's like,
12349080	12351080	yes, there's absolutely no one on this bridge
12351080	12353080	that looks threatening to me whatsoever.
12353080	12355080	Me just standing,
12355080	12357080	not even hiding in the crowd or anything,
12357080	12359080	and stops...
12359080	12361080	Oh, see, he's bumping into NPCs.
12361080	12363080	That's the biggest thing about tailing.
12363080	12364080	If that NPC bumps them,
12364080	12365080	they can turn around
12365080	12366080	and look you right in the eyes,
12366080	12367080	and you're like,
12367080	12369080	oops, you're not really supposed to do that.
12369080	12371080	He literally has a knife out,
12371080	12373080	and we're gonna...
12373080	12374080	I think he looks back here,
12374080	12376080	and then, yeah,
12376080	12377080	I remembered.
12377080	12378080	He looks back here,
12378080	12380080	and then he looks back as after he does a sprint
12380080	12382080	on top of the stairs, okay?
12382080	12383080	You're getting all the strats,
12383080	12384080	so he doesn't look back anymore
12384080	12386080	unless he gets bumped,
12386080	12388080	which he shouldn't.
12388080	12389080	No, he didn't.
12389080	12390080	He didn't. That's good.
12392080	12395080	And then he's about to break out in a sprint.
12395080	12397080	Hey, that's right.
12397080	12399080	And then you follow him,
12399080	12401080	and then the game wants you to...
12404080	12407080	I don't think he should have turned around at that point.
12407080	12408080	No, he shouldn't have.
12408080	12409080	I don't know why he did.
12409080	12412080	He's not coded to turn around at that section.
12412080	12413080	He's coded to turn around,
12413080	12415080	like, at the top of these stairs.
12416080	12418080	Unless the sequence broke.
12420080	12421080	Okay, the sequence broke
12421080	12422080	because he's supposed to do it
12422080	12423080	at the top of those stairs.
12423080	12424080	My goodness.
12424080	12426080	I thought we were about to desync there.
12427080	12428080	Not a game.
12428080	12429080	Not a game.
12429080	12431080	You gave me a heart attack.
12431080	12434080	We must ensure that the kidnappings continue.
12435080	12437080	No, there will be no kidnapping.
12438080	12439080	Hee hee hee.
12441080	12443080	Requiescati bacce.
12444080	12446080	Requiescati bacce.
12447080	12449080	And look at his hook arm.
12449080	12451080	Yawing, using that for a design.
12455080	12457080	I've got two sets of recruits.
12457080	12459080	Can they hurt these guys without dying?
12460080	12463080	I want them to get XP for fighting.
12464080	12466080	Can they do it without Persian?
12466080	12469080	I think they can, but no one leveled up.
12469080	12471080	Not one person leveled up doing that.
12471080	12472080	Nah, you're done.
12472080	12473080	You're naughty.
12473080	12475080	Users supposed to level up.
12477080	12479080	Did I get into the multiplayer?
12479080	12481080	No, I didn't actually.
12482080	12483080	I can't quite remember.
12483080	12485080	I think it was like you hide among the...
12485080	12486080	Oh, someone did level up.
12486080	12488080	We'll give her a weapon.
12489080	12491080	Look, we've got so many assassins.
12491080	12494080	I'm going to send them on...
12494080	12495080	Missions.
12495080	12498080	Sorry if this looks like chaotic mess on the screen right now.
12498080	12500080	It's just I've done it so many times.
12500080	12503080	You need to look for difficulty level 1 missions
12503080	12504080	and then send the recruit on it
12504080	12506080	and it will automatically make them level 2
12506080	12510080	so they can at least have a bit more of a fight into them.
12512080	12514080	The pigeons' eyes.
12515080	12517080	They're a bit...
12518080	12520080	Look, the game's from 2010.
12520080	12523080	Okay, it's an older game.
12523080	12525080	I'm not going to steal a horse.
12525080	12526080	That's not nice.
12526080	12528080	Committing Grand Horse Aul.
12528080	12530080	But we'll do this.
12530080	12531080	Have you played Unity?
12531080	12532080	I haven't.
12532080	12534080	I played Assassin's Creed,
12534080	12535080	Ezio's storyline,
12535080	12536080	and then I played 3
12536080	12539080	and I didn't really enjoy it so much.
12539080	12544080	And then I played Black Flag,
12544080	12547080	but I suck at it
12547080	12549080	because they changed the controls
12549080	12551080	and I'm absolutely awful at it
12551080	12553080	and I've never actually successfully completed it.
12553080	12555080	I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.
12555080	12559080	I think I'm going to go into the Tiberina Island.
12562080	12563080	I'll just use that bridge there.
12563080	12564080	That looks right.
12567080	12568080	You enjoyed your night?
12568080	12569080	I know Odyssey came out.
12569080	12570080	I never played that.
12570080	12571080	Like, the newer Assassin's Creed
12571080	12573080	I'm absolutely not familiar with at all.
12573080	12574080	I do apologize.
12574080	12575080	I mean, maybe we can play it
12575080	12576080	for the first time together.
12580080	12583080	I think Odyssey got a really good reputation.
12583080	12585080	I know there's that Japanese.
12585080	12586080	Where the heck am I trying to go?
12586080	12588080	Sorry, I'm getting so distracted.
12588080	12590080	Talking and playing at the same time.
12590080	12591080	I'm sorry.
12592080	12595080	Guess who we're about to meet?
12595080	12596080	Are you ready?
12598080	12599080	It's you.
12599080	12600080	It's you.
12602080	12604080	Who are we about to meet?
12615080	12617080	Leonardo da Vinci himself.
12623080	12624080	Hello, Leonardo.
12624080	12626080	Long time no see, buddy.
12630080	12633080	So, remember when Chesery said
12633080	12635080	the gun was crafted by a friend of mine?
12635080	12638080	It was crafted by Leonardo.
12638080	12640080	Because he's my friend.
12640080	12642080	Oh, congrats if your name's Leonardo.
12648080	12650080	He wanted to chop that thing off.
12651080	12654080	I don't get any of the modern ACs.
12654080	12656080	They don't have charm.
12656080	12658080	Yeah, the apple.
12660080	12663080	I gave the apple to Mario.
12663080	12664080	I am sorry.
12664080	12665080	Don't say that.
12665080	12667080	What's 100% thing for the tank mission?
12667080	12669080	You're making me scared now.
12670080	12673080	What's 100% thing for the tank mission?
12674080	12675080	Is it hard?
12676080	12678080	I thought this game was pretty gamer friendly.
12683080	12684080	You're making me now.
12684080	12686080	I'm starting to break out in a sweat.
12686080	12687080	We ain't even played the tank mission yet.
12687080	12689080	Oh no, what is it?
12690080	12691080	Stop!
12691080	12692080	Stop!
12692080	12693080	Is it bad?
12693080	12695080	360 hours for this dream?
12700080	12701080	I'm sweating.
12701080	12703080	Leonardo, he's drawing, he's doing his thing.
12705080	12708080	Did you know Leonardo da Vinci liked Willy?
12708080	12710080	That's a true fact.
12711080	12714080	You're getting educated with me.
12715080	12716080	The tank mission?
12716080	12718080	Oh, you're making me nervous.
12720080	12722080	I'm getting scared.
12724080	12728080	Is the tank mission where you have to claim all the towers and stuff?
12730080	12732080	I like to get the thing.
12732080	12733080	Okay, we have a long double blade.
12733080	12735080	We can now do double assassinations,
12735080	12736080	which is one of...
12736080	12739080	That was me slapping my leg before anyone claims that it was a fart.
12740080	12741080	I already know what I'm doing.
12741080	12743080	Fart and don't ever...
12744080	12746080	We're just unlocking new weaponry.
12746080	12748080	The next thing we're going to unlock is a leap glove,
12748080	12755080	which is fantastic to make jump-claiming about much easier.
12759080	12760080	I just remembered the tank mission.
12760080	12762080	I'm getting fucking nervous.
12763080	12765080	We're making me scared for when we do it.
12765080	12767080	I was going to leave the missions all to the end,
12767080	12768080	so we're doing story mode,
12768080	12770080	and then all the side quests stuff tomorrow,
12770080	12772080	and then 100% sync.
12774080	12776080	I don't know where we're heading next.
12776080	12777080	Oh, okay.
12777080	12779080	800 meters!
12779080	12781080	That's so far away.
12781080	12783080	I don't know if we can take an aqueduct.
12786080	12791080	We can take an aqueduct to...
12791080	12793080	Where the heck are the aqueducts?
12793080	12794080	Okay, behind me.
12794080	12797080	We can take an aqueduct to the mercenaries,
12797080	12800080	and then we'll just have to horse on the rest.
12805080	12808080	I'm getting nervous in case I can't 100% it.
12808080	12811080	It's literally in the title of tomorrow's stream.
12811080	12812080	I'm getting nervous.
12812080	12813080	I'm getting shaky.
12813080	12815080	Okay, I'm getting nervous.
12817080	12818080	Where am I trying to?
12818080	12819080	I'm trying to teleport.
12819080	12822080	Okay, first I need to go inside the guild,
12822080	12827080	and then I need to go to the mercenaries on the map,
12827080	12833080	and then we're going to do the first of the Leonardo missions.
12833080	12834080	Where's the heck?
12834080	12835080	Where's the heck?
12835080	12836080	Oh, there.
12836080	12837080	I'm literally right here.
12837080	12838080	Here, right here.
12841080	12843080	Yes, we'll do the Leonardo...
12843080	12845080	First Leonardo mission.
12845080	12847080	I will do the others at the end,
12847080	12849080	because I think it takes far too long to do them,
12849080	12850080	in my humble opinion,
12850080	12852080	although I can't remember them.
12852080	12854080	The layer of Romulus are like,
12854080	12857080	pretty good for climbing,
12857080	12859080	for those interested in climbing.
12859080	12861080	Where's my horse?
12861080	12862080	My horse.
12862080	12863080	Come here.
12863080	12865080	You're teasing me.
12865080	12866080	Okay, right.
12866080	12870080	We will very quickly skedaddle over to this area.
12870080	12874080	We actually still haven't unlocked the full map yet.
12874080	12878080	You don't unlock the full map until sequence 7, I think.
12878080	12880080	Act 7.
12880080	12883080	So we might hit a boundary wall.
12883080	12885080	I'm not sure if I'm going the right way.
12885080	12888080	There's multiple ways you can make your way to the location,
12888080	12890080	but I think I've done it right.
12890080	12892080	Yes, the boundary wall right there.
12892080	12896080	So we are doing it right in quotation marks.
12896080	12898080	Is it up or down?
12898080	12901080	Why are you sitting on the horse like that?
12901080	12902080	What is it?
12902080	12904080	Explain yourself.
12907080	12908080	Okay, we did it.
12908080	12909080	We did it.
12909080	12910080	We're here.
12910080	12912080	I think we just have a really basic mayor scenario,
12912080	12916080	and then we will do the first Leonardo mission,
12916080	12917080	which I hate,
12917080	12919080	because we've actually not got the crossbow bolt,
12919080	12921080	which is much easier if you have the fricking crossbow bolt,
12921080	12923080	but it's fine.
12923080	12926080	The mercenary should spawn in right in front of us.
12926080	12928080	3, 2, 1, A.
12928080	12929080	That's right.
12929080	12930080	You yikers.
12930080	12931080	Come with me.
12931080	12932080	Come with me.
12932080	12934080	You're going to beat these people up for me.
12934080	12935080	Thank you.
12937080	12940080	And just tell them to fight like that.
12940080	12942080	And that is how you utilize the mercenary.
12942080	12944080	Sorry, I'm itching my eyeball.
12944080	12948080	I have a real eyelash again.
12948080	12950080	And then basically, they just do all the work.
12950080	12952080	I can call my assassins and...
12952080	12953080	You know what?
12953080	12954080	I'll do it for the XP there.
12954080	12955080	Oh!
12955080	12957080	I just unlocked an assassin from everything.
12957080	12958080	I'll take it.
12958080	12960080	No, I'm kind of through with that.
12962080	12963080	Ooh.
12963080	12964080	Okay, done.
12968080	12971080	Okay, we now are going on a mission
12971080	12973080	in a different location.
12973080	12975080	Map retrieve from the overseer.
12975080	12977080	I cannot read that fast,
12977080	12979080	but thank you, game, for having faith in me
12979080	12981080	that I can read that fast.
12981080	12984080	But the truth of the matter is, I can't.
12984080	12985080	Don't do that.
12985080	12987080	Don't let that happen again.
12987080	12989080	Have a little drink of water, game.
12989080	12990080	Game, game.
12990080	12991080	My voice is dying.
12991080	12993080	I don't know if you can tell how messed up my voice is
12993080	12996080	or if it just kind of sounds like my normal voice at this part.
12999080	13001080	I'll go with the machine gun.
13003080	13006080	So, this 100% is don't kill anyone.
13006080	13007080	I have never done that before.
13007080	13009080	I always kill people.
13011080	13014080	And it's like, really, it's so much easier
13014080	13016080	if you have the crossbow bolt,
13016080	13021080	because, like, for goodness' sake, it...
13024080	13028080	Because the crossbow bolt doesn't give your location away,
13028080	13032080	but the bullets of the gun do, it's pretty bad.
13032080	13034080	I'm actually not wanting to move.
13034080	13037080	Yeah, that's why, because they turn around.
13038080	13040080	I'm gonna yank him.
13041080	13044080	I'm actually wanting to go back and kill that guy
13044080	13046080	if I'm being honest.
13048080	13052080	Maybe don't have to, question mark.
13054080	13057080	There is a rotating guard ahead, which I don't like.
13057080	13058080	Oh, he's coming!
13058080	13059080	Are you joking me?
13059080	13060080	I've just missed him.
13060080	13062080	Oh, just missed him.
13062080	13065080	We need to shoot him in order to get where we need to go.
13070080	13072080	There's two bullets.
13073080	13076080	Whenever there's a pigeon ledge, that means you can do a leap of faith.
13079080	13081080	Your enthusiasm of the game is cute.
13081080	13083080	It's just such a good game.
13085080	13087080	So, as long as he doesn't turn around.
13087080	13090080	If you run, it'll notify the guard of you.
13090080	13093080	So, don't run when you do these kind of things.
13093080	13097080	Or else the guards, the AI is basically going to be like,
13097080	13098080	I have found you.
13098080	13101080	And then you're like, please don't do that.
13101080	13102080	I would like to be uncalled,
13102080	13105080	because I don't want to redo this entire sequence all over again.
13109080	13113080	Okay, this is a bit of an issue.
13114080	13116080	There's a guard that rotates around the century of the wall,
13116080	13119080	and that one up there, I need to shoot both of them, basically.
13119080	13121080	But I need to wait until the other one rotates away.
13121080	13123080	Why don't you just hypnotize the guard?
13123080	13125080	For real!
13125080	13127080	But they can't see me from this distance.
13127080	13129080	I'm potent, I'm not that potent.
13129080	13131080	Right, so we can do that, at least.
13131080	13134080	And then, maybe...
13134080	13136080	Wait, there's a guy there.
13136080	13138080	Oh, I don't like that.
13139080	13142080	Uh...
13146080	13150080	Sorry, this part, you can fuck up so easily.
13150080	13153080	Okay, we didn't fuck up.
13153080	13155080	Burn it, and then we get this checkpoint.
13155080	13157080	Okay.
13157080	13159080	Ta-da!
13159080	13161080	We have achieved the checkpoint, we no longer have to sneak around.
13161080	13163080	We can just do our thing.
13163080	13165080	Pew!
13165080	13167080	I don't ever want to do that again.
13167080	13170080	She says, as she has to do it again.
13170080	13174080	You can just drop down, doesn't cause any damage to you.
13174080	13179080	But the music creators for the speed-up song,
13179080	13183080	like that is so terrifying.
13183080	13185080	It strikes blood into the hearts.
13185080	13188080	It strikes fear into the hearts, not blood into the hearts.
13188080	13192080	I mean, that's what hearts do, they pump blood around and stuff.
13193080	13196080	Get all oxygenated again.
13196080	13199080	Okay, this is the part I freaking hate.
13199080	13202080	Because I don't know how to, like, not get it to lock on.
13202080	13205080	You can literally go side to side and evade.
13205080	13208080	And you will still get... Why are there people there?
13208080	13212080	Like, I'm evading, but I'm probably going to get hit.
13212080	13215080	I don't know how to not get hit.
13215080	13218080	I played this so many times.
13219080	13221080	Although I did evade all of those,
13221080	13225080	so maybe my swirling is doing much better.
13225080	13229080	Evasive maneuvers, evasive maneuvers!
13229080	13231080	Ah, see, I don't get it!
13231080	13233080	I'm literally going side to side.
13233080	13235080	I wonder if it's a distance thing as well.
13235080	13237080	Like, if I get too close, the game's like,
13237080	13239080	you're not allowed to get that close,
13239080	13242080	and it's like, oh, sorry, you didn't really explain.
13242080	13245080	Like, pardon my French,
13245080	13249080	but je n'ai c'est quoi, on what's going on me.
13251080	13253080	Okay, let's go. Next sequence.
13253080	13255080	This is actually pretty badass.
13255080	13258080	I can't seem to have to admit.
13266080	13268080	Stabbed-in throw SFX.
13270080	13272080	We will use the tactical camera,
13272080	13275080	because it's literally, like, if you're down here,
13275080	13277080	it's like so close.
13277080	13281080	And you can use the map to see who's coming up,
13281080	13283080	so I can see there's one on the right,
13283080	13285080	and then we're going to swing back left,
13285080	13287080	and then we're going to swing back right.
13287080	13290080	You don't need to worry about the archers at all
13290080	13292080	in this part of the mission.
13292080	13294080	They don't hurt you.
13294080	13296080	I've never been hurt,
13296080	13299080	but you can see left side again on the red dot map,
13299080	13301080	which I'm covering up! Lovely!
13301080	13305080	I just realised I'm covering up the entirety of the map,
13305080	13308080	so you can't see any of that that I've just been commentating on.
13308080	13310080	I do apologise.
13313080	13315080	Again, the horses always get up.
13315080	13317080	Please don't worry. The horsey-worsies are fine.
13317080	13322080	You can pre-fire when the red markers spawn in.
13322080	13324080	You can get to it.
13324080	13327080	And you can, like, hit them before the markers actually show up,
13327080	13329080	because that's really loud.
13329080	13331080	Hopefully that's not too loud for you guys.
13335080	13337080	The horses are fine. Please don't worry.
13337080	13339080	All horses get back up in the game.
13343080	13346080	If they aim a bit too close, they're going to get me.
13349080	13351080	Am I going to get away with that?
13353080	13355080	Shoot them down!
13355080	13357080	That wasn't bad either.
13357080	13359080	Oh, back up on the horse!
13360080	13362080	You better stop!
13367080	13369080	This is, like, Snape or Simulator, honestly.
13369080	13370080	Oops!
13370080	13373080	Oh no, I'm going to get shot. I messed up.
13375080	13377080	Hello?
13377080	13379080	They're out the road!
13385080	13387080	I actually wanted to perish there.
13387080	13389080	He said I like feeling pain.
13391080	13393080	Sorry, I'm, like, really focusing.
13393080	13395080	I don't have the best aim on analogue.
13395080	13397080	So, I'll try it.
13398080	13401080	But yeah, this is the first mission.
13401080	13403080	It's the easiest out of them all.
13403080	13405080	This is still tutorial section stuff,
13405080	13407080	because the Leonardo missions are main game.
13407080	13411080	So, this is technical tutorial.
13411080	13413080	We still go in there.
13417080	13419080	I'm trying to remember the axe.
13419080	13423080	Maybe axe, which is the order.
13428080	13430080	Oh, can I hit the barrel?
13430080	13432080	Yeah, I can hit the barrel.
13433080	13435080	How many are there?
13435080	13437080	Okay, we've almost done the sequence,
13437080	13439080	and then we're back into the main game.
13440080	13443080	I might get another Kola, actually.
13446080	13448080	My voice is feeling it.
13450080	13455080	I don't know how to extend the stamina of my voice.
13455080	13457080	I'm not really sure.
13457080	13460080	Other than, like, be quiet five heads.
13460080	13463080	But, like, I want to stream.
13463080	13464080	I want to have a good time.
13464080	13466080	Like, I have so much lost time to make up for.
13466080	13468080	Like, you have no idea.
13469080	13472080	I saw you spawn in. I saw that.
13474080	13476080	I saw you spawn in.
13478080	13480080	Hydration and practice.
13480080	13483080	I've been using my voice for years now.
13484080	13486080	Just speak smaller words.
13486080	13488080	Okay.
13488080	13490080	Work is a call center agent.
13490080	13492080	Water helps.
13495080	13497080	Oh, actually.
13497080	13499080	Hopefully none of the girls are in here.
13499080	13501080	I want to do a short with them.
13501080	13505080	Apparently, girls can't make good weapon sounds.
13505080	13507080	Like, I'll make the sound of a gun.
13507080	13511080	So I'm going to ask all the girls to record an audio of them making sound of a gun.
13511080	13513080	And then I'm going to put it in a short.
13513080	13515080	It's just like a goofy, funny-ha-ha thing.
13515080	13517080	It's nothing serious.
13517080	13522080	I'm going to take a few yards from the location of where I'm supposed to go.
13522080	13524080	Are you kidding me?
13524080	13528080	So I was going to do a shotgun and see if they come up with, like, pistols.
13528080	13530080	Or maybe an AK.
13530080	13532080	We've got quite a few levels up.
13532080	13534080	We've got level three, which is fantastic.
13534080	13538080	We're starting to get a bit more serious with the recruits.
13538080	13541080	They're starting to get a bit more, like, they can survive.
13541080	13545080	I'm actually going to send them on a bigger mission.
13546080	13550080	I'm going to take the level three to go level up someone.
13550080	13552080	Can I send them on level twos?
13552080	13555080	I'll send them on level twos. It's very unlikely they're going to fail.
13555080	13558080	But the level two missions are quite long.
13561080	13563080	Wonder who's going to be the best.
13563080	13568080	I'm going with the classic shotgun, like, the ch-ch-ch-loser there.
13568080	13571080	But I'll be very interested to see what the girls come up with.
13571080	13573080	I'm trying to go brrrrr.
13577080	13587080	Wow, okay, I guess I will go back to the mercenaries to use the aqueduct there.
13587080	13589080	Oh, there's an aqueduct there as well.
13589080	13591080	Is that closer? I think so.
13592080	13595080	You can roll your R's if you're Scottish.
13596080	13601080	I know some languages, like, don't roll their R's.
13604080	13607080	I was going to say something and my brain completely blanked.
13607080	13609080	I'm now going to pretend otherwise.
13610080	13613080	Oh, I'm out of bounds. Hard and moir.
13614080	13616080	Can I still get to this aqueduct?
13616080	13618080	Not aqueduct, the...
13618080	13620080	It's not cistern. What is it?
13620080	13622080	Is it a cistern? Cistern access?
13625080	13629080	Oh my god, new name for Niji fans just dropped cisterns.
13629080	13633080	That's awful. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that out loud.
13633080	13635080	That's the dumbest thing I've said all day.
13639080	13641080	My views do not reflect that, Alveolar.
13641080	13643080	My views are my own. I do not reflect the company.
13643080	13646080	Thank you. I'm just playing Assassin's Creed, please, the middle.
13649080	13651080	What does your 11 kill streak sound like?
13652080	13656080	I don't know how to make sounds of knives or weaponry.
13663080	13665080	Watch whoever you enjoy.
13665080	13672080	Someone sent me a marshmallow and it was a link to someone from an agency.
13672080	13674080	I'm not going to name the agency.
13674080	13676080	They were like, please save her.
13676080	13678080	And I was like...
13679080	13681080	What do you want me to do?
13681080	13684080	They're locked into a contract.
13685080	13688080	We have a non-compete at VLR.
13688080	13693080	You can literally jump straight into a VTuber agency once your time's up here, if you're finished.
13693080	13696080	But what do you want me to do?
13696080	13701080	Seriously, you want me to message the company and be like, hey, can I buy her out?
13702080	13706080	Thank you for your faith in me, but what am I supposed to do?
13710080	13713080	I mean, sure, I would if I could, but...
13714080	13718080	I want everyone to be happy and having a good time while they're streaming, but...
13718080	13720080	I can't help everyone.
13722080	13724080	Set them free?
13725080	13728080	No, that sounds so bad, because it's like...
13728080	13731080	It sounds like buying like...
13737080	13739080	Hederation check.
13742080	13744080	I'm going to do a burp.
13745080	13748080	Buy the company, my goodness.
13748080	13750080	No chance.
13750080	13752080	VTuber Moses?
13753080	13757080	That is the funniest thing I think I've been called in a long time.
13757080	13760080	VTuber Moses, set them free.
13763080	13766080	That's hilarious.
13770080	13772080	Hijack the company.
13775080	13778080	Let companies cook. You'll see eventually.
13781080	13783080	Let my people go.
13787080	13790080	Once Cesare arrives, you will never get to him.
13790080	13793080	I intend to kill the French general.
13793080	13796080	Okay, we're getting assigned our next act.
13796080	13798080	The Frenchies.
13799080	13802080	Desolé if you're a French fry.
13802080	13805080	It's not in personal, mate. Not in personal.
13805080	13808080	You know, viva la France and all that.
13808080	13812080	And c'est la vie, and what other words do you say in French?
13812080	13815080	I will have my thieves as I retain his location.
13822080	13826080	I have no recruits to send on a mission, because I've already sent them on the mission.
13831080	13833080	Where are you going?
13833080	13835080	I am not used to anyone without follow-up.
13838080	13841080	I am Swiss, I totally support any French propaganda.
13842080	13844080	That's awful.
13851080	13853080	Oh, I said it wrong.
13858080	13860080	Oh no!
13860080	13863080	Oh no, I think I'm going to have to go back to scuff tracking.
13863080	13866080	My iPhone is at 20%.
13866080	13869080	Scuff tracking, here we go.
13869080	13873080	Unless I can get it to balance with the charger in...
13873080	13876080	Oh my god, you're hearing everything connect.
13876080	13879080	Okay, can I get it to balance?
13882080	13884080	We're getting a bit horizontal.
13884080	13886080	Right, this is dangerous.
13886080	13888080	I'm going to put you in front of my glass.
13888080	13892080	And I'm going to wedge you in between my keyboard.
13892080	13894080	Okay, this isn't working.
13894080	13897080	I'm going to wedge you in between...
13897080	13899080	My tea cup.
13899080	13901080	Let me just...
13901080	13903080	Oh, pardon me.
13905080	13906080	Okay.
13906080	13907080	Uh-huh.
13907080	13908080	Oh yeah?
13908080	13910080	Okay, yeah?
13910080	13912080	Are you still tracking?
13916080	13917080	Hello?
13917080	13918080	Yes!
13919080	13920080	I get it.
13920080	13921080	Okay, what actor are we on?
13921080	13924080	The banker or the French one?
13924080	13926080	I think we're in the French one.
13926080	13927080	What broke?
13927080	13928080	I didn't break anything.
13928080	13930080	If I ain't broke, don't fix it.
13930080	13932080	Right, we're going to see how much...
13934080	13938080	We're going to see how much it costs to buy the crossbow.
13938080	13940080	$12,800.
13940080	13942080	I don't have that.
13944080	13946080	I'll look away for a second.
13946080	13949080	I'm going to be wedged in between a body part.
13949080	13951080	How dare you insinuate?
13951080	13953080	Right, what mission are we doing?
13954080	13956080	Memory Star up here?
13958080	13962080	Is it the banker that we're on?
13962080	13964080	I kind of think we may be on the banker mission,
13964080	13966080	but I can't really remember.
13966080	13968080	And my wife had a baby?
13970080	13971080	It's Tony Tern Golem.
13971080	13972080	I want to try and do that,
13972080	13975080	but I think I would destroy my voice in like 20 minutes.
13975080	13977080	We hate it.
13980080	13982080	It's ink in the back of my throat.
13982080	13984080	It's your ink in the back of my throat.
13987080	13988080	We're going to rebuild.
13988080	13990080	We built this city.
13991080	13995080	We built this city on Florence.
13995080	14000080	Because that is the currency.
14004080	14006080	Actually, I need to do that audio.
14006080	14007080	Keep forgetting.
14007080	14008080	Post it.
14008080	14009080	I need to make it.
14009080	14012080	I think I can probably do it after this stream.
14014080	14016080	It's a free audio.
14016080	14017080	It's just on the ult.
14021080	14023080	I'm golem posing whilst gaming.
14023080	14026080	I mean, if you want to get technical.
14027080	14029080	Should that be a donors on reward?
14029080	14030080	It's just a picture.
14030080	14033080	Obviously I'd edit my face out and all that.
14033080	14036080	It's just a picture of me like bucking a snake.
14036080	14041080	Because that's a normally game on my chair in the golem pose.
14041080	14044080	And everyone's like, what is this?
14044080	14047080	And I was like, it just means what I'm doing.
14049080	14051080	Something the adventurer is.
14054080	14056080	They're like, what is this pale creature?
14056080	14058080	Oh wait, it clearly is golem.
14058080	14060080	No questions asked.
14066080	14067080	Oh my, yes please.
14067080	14075080	Excuse me, I'm on the mission.
14078080	14081080	M.E.'s eyes are currently rolling out of her skull right now.
14083080	14084080	How much?
14089080	14091080	Oh, I forgot to put what she was saying.
14092080	14095080	Yeah, I decided on...
14095080	14099080	Strongly clips and strongly...
14099080	14102080	R just to be strong R and strong clips.
14102080	14104080	Because I couldn't think of anything else.
14104080	14108080	Although someone sent a really good suggestion on Marshmallow.
14108080	14109080	I might change it.
14109080	14111080	I mean, we're super early days.
14111080	14112080	Like, I can literally change it.
14112080	14113080	I have something else.
14114080	14115080	Hey hey, Pipi!
14115080	14117080	Excuse me, I'm on a mission.
14117080	14118080	Where?
14118080	14119080	A mission?
14120080	14121080	Oh Lolo?
14122080	14123080	Okay, this is the banker.
14124080	14125080	This is the banker act.
14129080	14130080	Sorry.
14133080	14135080	I can't sing and do the golem voice.
14135080	14136080	My only wish?
14137080	14140080	I sound like Marsh from Homey.
14142080	14144080	Oh, I can't sing in the golem voice.
14144080	14149080	My only wish to catch a fish so juicy and sweet.
14154080	14155080	Homey!
14158080	14159080	That's terrible.
14159080	14161080	That's awful.
14162080	14164080	I think Emi is Kubeko.
14164080	14169080	She is, how you say, a tabernac.
14171080	14173080	And, yeah.
14174080	14175080	She doesn't count.
14176080	14177080	She doesn't count as a true Frenchie.
14178080	14179080	A true French fry.
14180080	14182080	French fries are European Frenchies.
14182080	14183080	The Swiss are the Swiss.
14184080	14185080	And the Kubekois.
14185080	14186080	The Kubek.
14186080	14187080	Kubek.
14188080	14189080	Kubek.
14192080	14194080	Homey is the silo stuff.
14197080	14201080	Honestly, her Kubekois is something I've heard before.
14202080	14204080	She says she's not very confident.
14204080	14206080	But as long as she can form sentences,
14206080	14207080	the best I can say is like,
14207080	14213080	Je vais, je vais, tu vas, il va, elle va.
14213080	14216080	Nous allons, nous allons, il va et elle va.
14216080	14218080	I can say, I would like, je voudrais,
14218080	14223080	I can say, I, which is, j'arrive.
14224080	14230080	I can say, I don't think I know any more
14230080	14233080	doing words in French, any more verbs.
14237080	14239080	All the French fries are like,
14240080	14241080	Okay, here we go.
14242080	14243080	I'm back.
14243080	14244080	What did I miss?
14244080	14246080	We're memeing on the French, like everyone else.
14247080	14250080	Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
14251080	14252080	Oh my God, my voice cracked.
14252080	14253080	Did you hear that?
14255080	14256080	Took years of French.
14256080	14258080	I think I can say the colors in French.
14259080	14262080	Rouge, rose,
14262080	14266080	orange,
14268080	14269080	green,
14271080	14273080	jolie,
14274080	14277080	noir, blanc,
14279080	14280080	marron,
14282080	14283080	what a French.
14283080	14285080	Do you money too, do I?
14285080	14287080	I'm looking for chésarés bankers.
14287080	14288080	Palais-vous francais?
14288080	14290080	Oui, oui, avec les poissons,
14290080	14292080	dans les sacs.
14292080	14294080	Ouais, what did you just make me say?
14294080	14296080	I can like kind of half read French.
14296080	14297080	I have no idea what I'm saying,
14297080	14299080	but I can kind of read it,
14299080	14301080	like with the letters and stuff.
14303080	14304080	The French aren't real,
14304080	14306080	it's a lie made up by the English.
14308080	14310080	Je suis monté, pardon.
14311080	14312080	All right, this way.
14316080	14318080	You're going to have to protect me, though.
14318080	14320080	The guards aren't being very friendly.
14320080	14321080	You're going to have to protect me.
14323080	14324080	Hello, gentlemen.
14324080	14326080	May I please double assassinate you?
14326080	14328080	No, double assassinate.
14328080	14330080	Oh, don't be detected!
14330080	14332080	Don't be detected with the mission,
14332080	14334080	and the first thing I do is go up
14334080	14336080	and kill some guys.
14336080	14338080	I'm not very smart, am I?
14339080	14340080	Oh well.
14343080	14345080	A little oversight, but...
14346080	14348080	It's fine.
14348080	14350080	Morning!
14352080	14354080	Good morning!
14355080	14357080	Good evening!
14357080	14360080	I really don't want to send my assassins
14360080	14362080	on, like, the Lancers,
14362080	14364080	but as long as they kill the right guy first,
14364080	14366080	it should be fine.
14368080	14370080	Right, sorry, the senator's currently complaining
14370080	14372080	about his money issues
14372080	14374080	and how he hates the Vorgia.
14374080	14376080	I'm talking right over it.
14378080	14379080	Oops!
14379080	14381080	Well, thank goodness they called,
14381080	14383080	came in and in.
14390080	14391080	Uh, hello?
14391080	14392080	Whoa!
14392080	14393080	Yeah, see this?
14393080	14395080	The citizens become assassins,
14395080	14396080	they get scared.
14396080	14398080	Why do you not do double blade?
14398080	14400080	I have a double blade.
14400080	14401080	I'm pretty sure there's, like,
14401080	14403080	stuff to do double blade stuff as well.
14404080	14406080	Uh, really appreciate it.
14406080	14408080	A few different skills to do here.
14409080	14412080	We should probably get rid of some of our noray.
14413080	14415080	This is where we start now.
14415080	14416080	We're doing 100% tomorrow.
14416080	14418080	We're just doing campaign mode right now.
14421080	14423080	Wouldn't be good time zone be easier.
14423080	14424080	Aha!
14424080	14426080	Good time zone, everyone!
14428080	14430080	That's awful.
14435080	14438080	Uh, we may be able to get a gun.
14438080	14439080	Yes!
14439080	14441080	No!
14441080	14444080	I was gonna sneak by them.
14445080	14446080	I like how he's continuing to talk
14446080	14448080	whilst being beaten up by a sword.
14450080	14452080	Are they not attacking him?
14454080	14457080	Assassin recruits, are you so for real right now?
14457080	14459080	Can you attack him?
14459080	14460080	What's going on?
14460080	14461080	Oh my god.
14461080	14463080	Oh, they've attracted more it guards.
14467080	14468080	What?
14468080	14470080	And now someone's grabbing the guard?
14470080	14471080	Hello?
14471080	14472080	Right, no.
14472080	14473080	This isn't my problem.
14473080	14474080	Sorry.
14475080	14478080	I don't know what is going on over there, but...
14480080	14483080	Uh, I don't think they will attack us.
14484080	14486080	We're so far away.
14486080	14488080	Okay, so the assassins are dealing with them.
14488080	14490080	That was, I think the AI was like,
14490080	14492080	no idea who to target first,
14492080	14494080	so it was just going for like everyone.
14498080	14500080	As a Spanish speaker, it should not be that bad.
14500080	14502080	I can understand quite a lot of Spanish.
14508080	14510080	That's the best I got for Spanish.
14510080	14512080	Sorry, but man's not got any Spanish.
14515080	14517080	I'm trying to think about this one.
14520080	14521080	Puta matvee!
14521080	14522080	Oh wait, no, I did wrong.
14522080	14524080	Puta matvee!
14526080	14528080	That's my Espanol.
14530080	14531080	We're going...
14532080	14534080	Guards, guards, guards.
14538080	14539080	No, a horse.
14539080	14540080	Anything but a horse.
14541080	14543080	I'm sorry, but you're getting targeted first.
14543080	14545080	I don't want any horse problems.
14547080	14548080	Oh, the senator's under attack?
14548080	14550080	No, they should be attacking me.
14551080	14552080	How much health has he got?
14552080	14555080	Oh no, he's still like not even lost the square health.
14555080	14557080	Oh no, oh no, oh no.
14557080	14559080	Assassins help now.
14560080	14562080	Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good.
14562080	14563080	And someone got promoted.
14564080	14566080	Smells like promotion, boys.
14568080	14569080	Can I...
14569080	14571080	I don't think I can sneak past these guys, so...
14571080	14573080	We're just going to go for it, we're just going to send it.
14574080	14577080	My assassin recruits just take too long to come back and...
14578080	14579080	I'm dumb, so...
14584080	14586080	Time to get some sleep, please rest well.
14587080	14589080	Sleep well, sweet dreams.
14591080	14592080	Do you know other Italian words?
14593080	14594080	No.
14594080	14597080	Only like Spingy for push, Ayuto for help.
14598080	14600080	Katsuo, to swear.
14602080	14604080	It's Emmy at piano.
14607080	14609080	Aw, it's Emmy at piano?
14609080	14611080	She tickled on them ivories.
14611080	14613080	Thank goodness I have ivory skin,
14613080	14615080	because my goodness, I'm in for a good time.
14618080	14620080	They're attacking me, anyways.
14623080	14627080	I've not played this game, I've played the game in Dutch once.
14627080	14630080	Just so to say follow me in Dutch, you say volg, mate.
14633080	14635080	But, yeah, not really.
14635080	14637080	It's just subtitles and stuff.
14640080	14641080	I knew it.
14647080	14648080	Why in Dutch?
14648080	14651080	I wanted to learn Dutch at one point, but I gave up.
14653080	14655080	I only know Scots in English.
14658080	14659080	Family.
14663080	14666080	Yeah, Dutch is one of the easiest languages to learn.
14666080	14668080	If you're English speaking,
14668080	14673080	it only takes apparently like 40 hours to like get the basics to...
14673080	14675080	in all that jazz, so...
14676080	14679080	20 Florence, that was it.
14679080	14681080	In that chest.
14682080	14684080	It is a very goofy language,
14684080	14687080	but it's so easy to speak and learn.
14688080	14690080	So, if you're ever bored and you're like,
14690080	14692080	I want to do something,
14692080	14694080	just learn some Dutch, learn the animals.
14694080	14696080	The animals are quite funny,
14696080	14699080	because you can see how literal it is with animals.
14699080	14701080	So, Tartel is shieldpoden,
14701080	14704080	which literally shielded,
14704080	14706080	and then padded.
14706080	14708080	Shieldpoden.
14709080	14711080	It seems you are ready to die like a gentleman.
14712080	14715080	I've got to learn German since my sister moved there.
14715080	14717080	Hello, Lloyd, how are you?
14717080	14719080	Are you good?
14719080	14720080	Is the grass road?
14720080	14722080	No, the grass is groin.
14723080	14725080	There's some German for you.
14726080	14729080	Right, if we don't touch the floor, we get 100%,
14729080	14731080	but it's a bit finicky, honestly.
14732080	14734080	So, it's not a big deal if we touch the floor.
14735080	14738080	Yeah, the grass is groin, yeah.
14740080	14744080	Dine and murder is a lovely lady, yeah.
14748080	14750080	Sorry, I'm like completely goofing off right now.
14750080	14752080	I'm not even explaining the game anymore.
14752080	14754080	I'm just having a good time.
14757080	14760080	Most English people have difficulty with the ch.
14760080	14762080	I assume that's what you wanted me to say.
14762080	14766080	Yeah, in Scots to say a lock, which is a lake,
14766080	14769080	you say a loch, loch.
14771080	14773080	And then we also roll our r's.
14773080	14777080	It's not girl, it's girl, girl.
14777080	14782080	So, Scots kind of naturally have a buff for other languages,
14782080	14786080	which is pretty handy when you're trying to impress someone.
14786080	14791080	I think to say, all day every day in...
14794080	14797080	All day, took one Taiwan, all day every day in Vietnamese.
14797080	14799080	Nah, I don't think that's right.
14799080	14800080	Please perish.
14801080	14803080	Give me a clap, Papo.
14805080	14806080	I'm gonna clap them.
14807080	14808080	Sorry.
14810080	14812080	Yeah, this is just a classic tailing mission.
14812080	14815080	You're not to be out of their POV for 25 seconds.
14816080	14817080	We are tailing the banker.
14817080	14819080	He currently has our Jussie Jussie money,
14819080	14822080	which we do get back at the end of this mission.
14823080	14826080	I thought it's he was about to jump on the floor there,
14826080	14829080	and I was about to inhale a big inhale.
14832080	14834080	Khef me in clap, Papo.
14834080	14835080	Me spank me daddy.
14835080	14836080	Oh!
14837080	14839080	Khef me in clap, Papo.
14839080	14840080	There you go.
14841080	14844080	To the one Dutch person listening in right now,
14844080	14847080	he's having the time of his life.
14847080	14849080	He is absolutely on it.
14850080	14852080	He's like, I'll see your belief.
14852080	14853080	Oh, no, that's please.
14853080	14854080	How do you say mercy?
14854080	14855080	How do you say thank you?
14855080	14856080	Thank you, Bill.
14856080	14857080	He's like, oh, thank you, Bill.
14857080	14858080	Strawberry.
14858080	14859080	Thank you, Bill.
14859080	14860080	And his reactant.
14862080	14863080	It's me.
14865080	14866080	That's it.
14866080	14869080	I know like the other stuff, like Iquil.
14869080	14871080	It's like I won, like Iquiline.
14871080	14872080	Iquiline.
14872080	14873080	Go, go, go, go.
14874080	14877080	If you are a human, you say Iquiline.
14877080	14878080	Go, go, go, go.
14878080	14882080	If you are en vrou, Iquil.
14885080	14887080	Is he gonna get me in trouble?
14887080	14888080	I don't.
14888080	14892080	I think I can like kill this guy from the box.
14892080	14894080	What's inside the box?
14894080	14895080	Nothing.
14895080	14896080	I'm stuck.
14896080	14897080	Please get out.
14897080	14898080	Okay.
14898080	14900080	That was funny and unique.
14900080	14902080	Please don't do that again.
14902080	14906080	I always forget how to navigate this part.
14906080	14907080	Are you a fish?
14907080	14909080	I'm a cuttlefish.
14909080	14911080	I'm a little piece of paper.
14911080	14914080	Because I do hypnosis.
14914080	14917080	But I've yet to actually make a hypnosis.
14917080	14919080	Well, I have a hypnosis audio coming out.
14919080	14923080	But like an actual free to view one, like ASMR stuff.
14923080	14926080	Oh, can I need to get on that?
14926080	14929080	We go cold again, but it sounds terrible.
14929080	14933080	I'm kind of glad because I literally have so much ASMR stuff I need to edit.
14933080	14939080	And basically I need to wake up and then work before stream.
14939080	14942080	Because after stream, I can't do anything.
14942080	14944080	I don't want to kill this.
14947080	14949080	Someone's up there.
14953080	14957080	I really don't want to kill because if you put the bodies on the floor,
14957080	14961080	sometimes the bodies desync this.
14961080	14963080	Please stop.
14963080	14966080	Are you kidding me?
14966080	14968080	This thing was don't be detected.
14968080	14969080	I messed that up.
14969080	14970080	My goodness.
14970080	14971080	No, don't fall.
14971080	14972080	Okay.
14972080	14973080	It's fine.
14973080	14974080	The senator's right there.
14974080	14975080	The banker's over there.
14975080	14976080	Well, failed anyway.
14976080	14978080	It doesn't matter if I touch the floor.
14978080	14979080	Oh.
14979080	14980080	You brought the money.
14980080	14981080	Well, well.
14981080	14982080	Yeah.
14982080	14985080	The banker has a special evening plan.
14985080	14988080	I'm either on Twitter or on YouTube, but I've got three ASMR videos.
14988080	14992080	I need to come out and be like, thanks for 3,000 subscribers.
14992080	14993080	Subscribblers.
14993080	14995080	I better not lose sight of that.
14995080	14996080	Yeah.
14996080	15003080	Basically YouTube, like my stats say that I've been like subscribed to like over 5,000 subscribers.
15003080	15008080	But obviously, like, because we've been getting cold, it like keeps going down again.
15008080	15009080	And it's like, oh, okay.
15009080	15010080	I guess.
15010080	15012080	But, oh no, I can't leave.
15012080	15014080	Oh, I don't have to leave.
15014080	15015080	How do I get up here?
15015080	15016080	What are you thinking?
15016080	15017080	Where's the law?
15017080	15018080	Oh.
15018080	15019080	How do I get up here?
15019080	15020080	Yeah.
15020080	15021080	Oh.
15021080	15025080	Well, Vila only stream on YouTube.
15025080	15027080	There'll be Twitch streams.
15027080	15035320	Um, not really interested in Twitch because of the arbitrary, like, you're fine, but you're
15035320	15036320	not fine.
15036320	15037320	And yeah.
15037320	15042600	Whereas like YouTube, at least it's kind of like there's definitely an open status
15042600	15043600	quo with YouTube.
15043600	15047600	And that's much easier to, like, freaking sick.
15047600	15048600	Ezio.
15048600	15049600	Darling.
15049600	15050600	Hen.
15050600	15052600	You're stressing me out.
15052600	15053600	Get up.
15053600	15054600	Get it up.
15054600	15055600	Don't be nervous.
15055600	15056600	One in three men.
15056600	15057600	Get it up.
15057600	15058600	What do you mean?
15058600	15062600	I'm putting more pressure on you to perform.
15062600	15063600	Get it up.
15063600	15067600	Maybe that would be a really funny audio.
15068600	15073600	Like, I'm absolutely desperate and I'm like, get up, get up, get up.
15073600	15076600	But I'm feeling that'd be really, maybe for a meme audio.
15076600	15077600	I can do that.
15077600	15080600	I don't think that'd be a really funny audio.
15080600	15087600	I get, like, really aggressive, like, come on.
15087600	15091600	I've never been all on some before.
15091600	15093600	A lot of people have been.
15093600	15094600	Yeah.
15094600	15097600	The culling stops once, like, more content comes up.
15097600	15102600	So once I finish the stream, YouTube is going to have to admit to itself that I have 8,000
15102600	15103600	hours.
15103600	15104600	No.
15104600	15109600	I have eight hours in Assassin's Creed and, yeah, people were, like, actually interacting
15109600	15110600	and stuff on stream.
15110600	15112600	So, yeah, YouTube.
15112600	15114600	Strongly won.
15114600	15115600	YouTube zero.
15115600	15119600	And the girls have been absolutely fantastic about the culling as well.
15119600	15123600	Like, they have been, I asked them.
15123600	15126600	Like, I do not expect the girls to stream every single day.
15126600	15128600	I've told them countless times.
15128600	15131600	The only reason I can do it is because I have Rotism, your honour.
15131600	15137600	But I did ask them, like, hey, for the first week, you're most likely going to have the
15137600	15138600	most views.
15138600	15143600	Like, you'll kind of, like, the debuff, no, buff from debut.
15143600	15148600	And, like, all of them were like, yeah, I'll give it my all.
15148600	15150600	Like, I'll stream as much as I can in the first week.
15150600	15152600	So freaking thankful and grateful.
15152600	15158600	And, like, I really think it will, like, completely help with the culling and all that jazz.
15158600	15162600	So this mission is bizarre.
15162600	15166600	You basically have to guess the path of where you need to go.
15166600	15168600	And, of course, I haven't unlocked the map.
15168600	15170600	So I've freaking done it wrong already.
15170600	15172600	Is it this way?
15172600	15174600	But you're also timed as well.
15174600	15178600	And I don't think I can remember off the top of my head.
15178600	15182600	I think I have to go up these stairs.
15186600	15189600	No, right, I'm going the wrong way.
15189600	15192600	So they get, like, suspicious of you if you go the wrong way.
15192600	15197600	And it's like, I'm sorry.
15197600	15201600	Oh, I know, like, the general idea, but I don't know the right way, 100%.
15201600	15207600	I don't even remember going past these portals, honestly.
15207600	15212600	I think we go right of the church.
15212600	15215600	And there's, like, upstairs, right of the church.
15215600	15218600	My brain is telling me.
15218600	15221600	Goodness.
15221600	15224600	Yes, and then take a left under here, and then the bridge that's up ahead.
15224600	15226600	Okay, I think we've already nailed it.
15226600	15231600	That is literally how much I've put to scoop.
15231600	15234600	The noise keeps putting me off, but, like, I know where I'm going.
15234600	15237600	Okay, geez.
15237600	15239600	Literally, this is the correct way.
15239600	15241600	And the game's like, I was suspicious.
15241600	15243600	No, this is the correct way, and I know it is.
15243600	15246600	I've played it enough to know this is the right way.
15246600	15247600	This is the way.
15247600	15249600	Anyone watch Mandalorian?
15249600	15251600	Grogo's adorable.
15251600	15252600	Grogo.
15252600	15253600	See, there we go.
15253600	15255600	We did it.
15255600	15258600	And yeah, that's all we have to do.
15258600	15261600	And we have completed this section.
15261600	15265600	None, none, more than an angry scorn.
15265600	15268600	Oh, yeah.
15268600	15271600	PayPal.
15271600	15274600	I don't know what's going on with the PayPal for the business,
15274600	15276600	because we literally submitted.
15276600	15279600	It has been established for months.
15279600	15281600	Like, all the stuff we've established for months.
15281600	15286600	I think, unironically, you guys were supporting, like, A.C.
15286600	15290600	and me so much that PayPal's like, this is suspicious.
15290600	15292600	And then the PayPal's now blocked.
15292600	15296600	So thank you for all the support you've shown the girls already.
15296600	15299600	You literally got the account suspended.
15299600	15304600	You've literally, like, so much support you've suspended
15304600	15307600	being able to support the girls' monetary,
15307600	15311600	which is hilarious if you think of it.
15311600	15314600	Okay, we're just tailing the guards.
15314600	15316600	This is the course on mission I was talking about,
15316600	15318600	which is necessary to have them.
15318600	15321600	And if you avoid the guards as much as possible
15321600	15323600	to hold on to the group for as long as possible
15323600	15326600	because you have two sets of girls
15326600	15329600	that will go out to distract guards.
15329600	15332600	But if you get too close to guards and you didn't want to distract,
15332600	15334600	they essentially get wasted.
15334600	15339600	And it's about me literally suffering from success.
15339600	15345600	I think management managed to pay everyone
15345600	15350600	for the watch-alongs in time before that happened.
15350600	15353600	But I hope so, because there was a lot of money.
15353600	15355600	I think, like, the total for sponsors...
15355600	15358600	No! We lost a group to that.
15358600	15361600	To the PayPal.
15361600	15366600	I think the total of, like, sponsorships was, like...
15366600	15367600	I don't mind talking about this,
15367600	15370600	was, like, roughly in the 5,000 US dollars mark
15370600	15374600	for everyone, like, compiled.
15374600	15377600	The original budget was, like, 20,000,
15377600	15382600	but hardly anyone was replying to the agency.
15382600	15389600	So shout out to Umi Plus and shout out to VNU Agency.
15389600	15393600	Don't be surprised if you see us collaborating with them.
15393600	15396600	They were fantastic and lovely
15396600	15399600	and actually gave us the time of day.
15399600	15401600	Um...
15401600	15403600	Yeah.
15404600	15407600	So don't be surprised if you see us working with those girls
15407600	15410600	because their agency was kind enough to give us the time of day,
15410600	15415600	whereas pretty much everyone else ignored us, so...
15415600	15417600	Yeah.
15421600	15422600	Happy it went well.
15422600	15426600	Yes, the watch-alongs were a complete success.
15426600	15432600	Special thank you to everyone who did them and all of that jazz.
15433600	15436600	I'm currently listening to flirting in my ear
15436600	15437600	because I just heard her say,
15437600	15441600	Priest of Confession or something like that.
15441600	15443600	Oh, my God.
15443600	15448600	What happens if we had a nun design, okay?
15448600	15452600	But then she had, like, a real design under it,
15452600	15454600	but we promote her as, like, a genuine,
15454600	15456600	like, completely covered up nun.
15456600	15459600	And, like, the promo artwork is at her voice lines
15459600	15462600	or, like, super conservative and everything.
15462600	15465600	And then, on debut, she reveals her real design.
15465600	15467600	That'd be so cool.
15467600	15468600	I'm allowed to say this stuff out loud
15468600	15470600	because I don't control the design,
15470600	15472600	so I'm allowed to say this stuff.
15472600	15474600	Um...
15474600	15476600	I've got none to do with it.
15476600	15477600	Uh...
15477600	15480600	I love having no more responsibilities.
15480600	15481600	There's not gonna be a Fond de la Buse
15481600	15484600	because I don't have that responsibility anymore.
15484600	15486600	Yay!
15486600	15489600	But admit it, you love Fond de la Buse.
15496600	15498600	I'm allowed to do it.
15504600	15507600	Seeing you all to come alive was so fun.
15507600	15508600	Did you, like, see in the behind the scenes
15508600	15511600	of how we all looked?
15511600	15515600	I am very interested in getting a Celtic design.
15515600	15519600	Uh, I'm gonna say something controversial, Karen.
15519600	15523600	I actually don't, like, have Mbuba on Vichubama Do.
15523600	15525600	And not my thing.
15525600	15527600	And, like, the cleavage and all that.
15527600	15530600	No, not my thing.
15530600	15534600	No, he got yo-inged by two of the freaking girls.
15534600	15535600	Are you so dumb?
15535600	15538600	Why would you do that?
15538600	15540600	Grrr.
15540600	15542600	V's sucking my fame age is like,
15542600	15546600	bruv, it was rough.
15546600	15547600	It was rough.
15547600	15548600	Development was rough.
15548600	15549600	I'm very happy.
15549600	15551600	I never have to develop anything ever again.
15551600	15553600	Like, it's completely off-handed.
15553600	15555600	I no longer have to do anything.
15555600	15559600	And it's so, it's such a good feeling.
15559600	15561600	Right, we're just gonna hire these courtesans
15561600	15563600	to make sure all is good.
15563600	15567600	But I think we're, like, pretty safe.
15567600	15568600	Make yourself flat.
15568600	15571600	Honestly, I might.
15571600	15575600	Um, in an alternative costume or something.
15575600	15576600	Design.
15576600	15579600	Alternative outfit, that's what you say.
15579600	15580600	Target is on the move.
15580600	15585600	I repeat, tango is on the move.
15585600	15586600	Alpha.
15586600	15587600	Bravo.
15587600	15588600	Charlie.
15588600	15589600	Delta.
15589600	15590600	Echo.
15590600	15591600	Foxtrot.
15591600	15592600	Gamma.
15592600	15593600	Indigo.
15593600	15594600	I don't know if that's alphabet.
15594600	15595600	Right, right, right.
15595600	15597600	Girls, girls, put your arm down.
15597600	15599600	Put your arm down.
15599600	15601600	Into the hay bale of we go.
15601600	15604600	The hay bale of shame.
15604600	15605600	But big plus for you.
15605600	15608600	Behind the scenes and the info.
15608600	15611600	What better way to celebrate my victims
15611600	15613600	than to join in the brotherhood?
15613600	15617600	Yeah, like, I'm really, not really bothered for secrets.
15617600	15618600	It's like, how do you do this?
15618600	15620600	Well, put a lot of money behind it.
15620600	15621600	Okay, how do you do that?
15621600	15623600	Well, put a lot of money behind it.
15623600	15625600	If you ever want to start a VTuber agency,
15625600	15627600	I'm gonna say this to you,
15627600	15630600	and this is the best advice you will ever get.
15630600	15632600	Whatever you think it's gonna cost,
15632600	15633600	double it,
15633600	15635600	and then give it some more.
15635600	15637600	Whatever time you think it's gonna take,
15637600	15638600	double it,
15638600	15641600	and give it some more.
15641600	15648600	I had a lot of issues with, um,
15648600	15651600	like, artists going past, like, deadlines.
15651600	15655600	So, everything slid back into me,
15655600	15657600	and it was horrific for me,
15657600	15660600	which is why I don't have a lot of things done.
15660600	15662600	Like, my ASMR audios are recorded,
15662600	15665600	but they aren't edited for you that go on YouTube.
15665600	15668600	And it's a shame because I wanted to have that all done,
15668600	15670600	but, you know, things happened and stuff happens,
15670600	15671600	and...
15671600	15673600	But everything's been fantastic.
15673600	15675600	Like, the reception the girls received,
15675600	15678600	like, I'm just so glad people are, like, loving on them
15678600	15680600	and just so happy with them.
15680600	15682600	Like, um,
15682600	15685600	it was, like, not easy to have...
15685600	15686600	I'm about to get caught,
15686600	15688600	because I'm freaking sitting on a wall.
15688600	15692600	It was, like, not easy to, like,
15692600	15694600	assign people a pre-made model.
15694600	15696600	Like, I saw some people, like, ask,
15696600	15699600	like, why don't they just create the models themselves
15699600	15700600	that they like?
15700600	15702600	And it's like, you have...
15702600	15704600	I understand that Idol End do that.
15704600	15707600	You have no idea how freaking hard it is
15707600	15709600	to coordinate, like, X amount of modellers
15709600	15711600	to come together, to come make a concept,
15711600	15712600	come to this, come to that.
15712600	15714600	I am not doing that approach.
15714600	15717600	Please do not think the other is going to end up doing that approach.
15717600	15719600	However, the girls are more than welcome to...
15719600	15722600	Hello? Hello? No, we missed a...
15723600	15726600	We missed the opportunity to assassinate them.
15726600	15727600	Bruh.
15727600	15729600	Come back here right now. My goodness.
15729600	15731600	Come back here.
15731600	15733600	Oh, right. Well, just do it later.
15733600	15734600	Oh, but just...
15734600	15736600	Are you supposed to walk right in front of us?
15736600	15739600	I think the court is on its path and maybe mess them up.
15739600	15740600	Bruh, get right back here.
15741600	15743600	But yeah, I am more than happy for the girls
15743600	15746600	to tell me what they want for alternative outfits and stuff.
15746600	15748600	That's not a problem at all.
15750600	15755600	But to do a debut that has input from the start,
15755600	15760600	that's like being signed on in development
15760600	15762600	is like six months in the making.
15762600	15765600	No one wants to be hanging about six months
15765600	15768600	waiting for their new job to start.
15768600	15770600	Yano?
15770600	15772600	Oh, Meru. Hi, Meru.
15772600	15773600	How are you doing?
15773600	15775600	He has a game.
15776600	15777600	Amy's gone live.
15777600	15778600	Okay. Amy...
15778600	15780600	Oh, whoops, I was in pain and tension.
15780600	15783600	Hold on, I'm getting walloped by a frickin' lance.
15783600	15785600	Oh, no, the hay bale!
15786600	15788600	Oh, my ankles!
15790600	15792600	The hay bale! I missed...
15792600	15794600	Oh, that's more guards!
15794600	15796600	I'm just... I'm hiding in the corner.
15796600	15798600	There's so many guards around me.
15804600	15807600	Oh, my God! How did they all follow me here?
15807600	15809600	All right, I'm calling in the assassins.
15809600	15810600	You're stuck.
15811600	15813600	Oh, my God.
15813600	15815600	There is so many.
15820600	15822600	Rip the ankles, I know.
15826600	15828600	Funny you come in here, Meru.
15828600	15830600	I was just talking about your agency.
15832600	15834600	I was seeing how Yumi Plus
15834600	15837600	is one of the very few agencies
15837600	15840600	that responded to the watch-along offers
15840600	15842600	that VLR made.
15842600	15845600	Suspicious shout-out to Yumi Plus.
15845600	15848600	We love Yumi Plus out here.
15850600	15852600	They found us in two seconds.
15852600	15854600	Literally, I was pinned against that wall.
15854600	15857600	I was like, please don't find me, please don't find me, please don't find me.
15857600	15859600	Oh, what? Yeah.
15859600	15861600	Hardly.
15861600	15864600	We were talking about the watch-along sponsors for VLR's debut.
15864600	15867600	And your agency and VNU
15867600	15869600	were the only two agencies
15869600	15871600	that were kind enough to respond to us.
15871600	15873600	Where are Claudia and Maria?
15873600	15875600	We just talked with the money.
15875600	15877600	They followed us all.
15877600	15879600	So, we're trying to go to Amy's room.
15879600	15881600	I have good news for you.
15881600	15883600	I promote you to go to Amy's room.
15883600	15886600	So, if any mods you get,
15886600	15888600	one speaking permission,
15888600	15891600	Amy's stream link.
15891600	15894600	That's your only time you're allowed to talk.
15894600	15897600	Whoa, what's going on with the code in there?
15897600	15899600	I don't think I've seen that before.
15899600	15902600	All those numbers?
15902600	15904600	No more talking mods.
15904600	15906600	Silence!
15906600	15908600	Thank you.
15908600	15911600	Please enjoy watching AmyBizu.
15911600	15914600	I recommend you watch any of my gen-mates when they go live
15914600	15918600	because I myself am an endurance streamer.
15918600	15922600	And I will be here for many, many an hour.
15922600	15925600	I will be trying to finish the campaign mode of this game.
15925600	15928600	So, please do not feel any type of way
15928600	15930600	if you go to watch any of my gen-mates.
15930600	15932600	I absolutely appreciate it and love it.
15932600	15936600	Please always consider liking and scrub-scraping
15936600	15938600	to their channels.
15938600	15942600	I would love to see them get ahead of me sub-wise
15942600	15945600	because the girls are fantastic
15945600	15949600	and they have so much potential that I see in them.
15949600	15951600	And I just want them to...
15951600	15953600	I did not want to take your horse.
15953600	15956600	Please get back on your horse and leave me alone.
15956600	15958600	I apologize.
15958600	15962600	Oh, we're still short of the crossbow.
15962600	15967600	Maybe we can make enough money if we send the recruits.
15967600	15970600	What kind of need the crossbow for this mission that's coming up?
15970600	15974600	If you do not have the crossbow, it is a heck on Earth.
15974600	15976600	It's not a fun thing.
15976600	15978600	Mercy's laugh is so good.
15978600	15980600	You're running the content. You didn't say content too?
15980600	15982600	Yeah, tomorrow we do all the side content.
15982600	15986600	Today we do campaign mode and go back to 100% stuff.
15986600	15988600	Yeah, see, look at that money.
15988600	15992600	A thousand florins, thousand, thousand...
15992600	15995600	Oh, that's also another Scottish slang for you.
15995600	15998600	Sometimes you can drop the T-H and make it an E.
15998600	16003600	So the number fair T becomes the number fair T.
16003600	16005600	I don't know if you can even hear the difference, but yeah, with an F.
16005600	16007600	Very.
16009600	16014600	Whoa, we have 15,000? That's like so much money.
16014600	16016600	I didn't expect that much, actually.
16016600	16021600	I'm going to send the assassins on another contract just to get them more XP.
16021600	16028600	Because obviously the higher they are, the more likely they are not to fall in battle.
16028600	16031600	I really don't want anyone to fall in battle.
16031600	16033600	We should get a level up if they come back soon enough.
16033600	16034600	Right.
16034600	16035600	Someone say gambling time?
16035600	16039600	Wait, why is Amy doing it on her stream for you to say gambling time?
16039600	16041600	Is she being a naughty?
16041600	16043600	Oh, there's a thief down there.
16043600	16046600	Oh, I did gamble with all the money.
16046600	16048600	No, we're not gambling with the florins.
16048600	16050600	I need it for the crossbow ball.
16050600	16056600	And then we're going to go and travel to the barracks.
16056600	16058600	Come, will be cheap.
16058600	16060600	Crossbow ball.
16060600	16064600	Best in slot, which is BIS.
16064600	16066600	Best in slot or biz for short.
16066600	16070600	Any biz.
16070600	16074600	She's doing ASMR.
16074600	16077600	Oh, that's why she DM'd me asking about that.
16077600	16079600	Okay, yeah.
16079600	16081600	It makes sense now.
16081600	16084600	You may enjoy Amy's ASMR.
16084600	16092600	For no particular reason.
16092600	16094600	We gamble.
16094600	16096600	It's supposed to be ASMR.
16096600	16098600	Yeah, I never should.
16098600	16100600	I liked it, like ASMR.
16100600	16103600	I should DM and she's like, am I allowed to do ear licking?
16103600	16104600	I'm like, you know what?
16104600	16105600	Just go for it.
16105600	16112600	I said, I told her, don't breathe while you do the licking.
16112600	16115600	What does she mean by this?
16115600	16117600	I'm not that does not surprise me.
16117600	16120600	The French puttane have us under pressure.
16120600	16122600	Tell me about their gender.
16122600	16124600	Hydration check.
16124600	16127600	Chairs are a persuaded King Nui to lend him an entire army.
16127600	16129600	But don't let go.
16129600	16132600	Gamba to impress or discuss the course.
16132600	16135600	I don't have time before I have Valois by the throat.
16135600	16137600	We have them in a retreat.
16137600	16139600	They seem to be getting closer.
16139600	16140600	The situation...
16140600	16142600	What does that mean?
16142600	16144600	Ear licking.
16144600	16147600	Benny, so maybe I could use a little help.
16147600	16150600	Yeah.
16150600	16151600	Don't take any damage.
16151600	16152600	Close it.
16152600	16155600	Oh, I should have bought smoke bombs.
16155600	16157600	This is bizarre.
16157600	16161600	They spawned in so many enemies.
16161600	16164600	I get it's supposed to be that you're overrun, but...
16164600	16166600	My goodness.
16166600	16168600	Hold on.
16171600	16174600	You can disengage from fights by just running away and jumping.
16174600	16177600	For some reason, jumping makes the AI cry.
16177600	16180600	The AI will not swing for you if you jump.
16185600	16187600	The other entrance.
16187600	16189600	Wait a minute.
16189600	16194600	That has a double meaning.
16194600	16196600	No, no, refling the other entrance.
16196600	16198600	The other one.
16202600	16203600	Okay.
16203600	16206600	Now we destroy all of the baddies.
16210600	16215600	Oh, I do love going on a kill street because it's really satisfying.
16215600	16217600	Is that everyone?
16218600	16221600	The Baron de Rova, signals from the field.
16221600	16225600	Oh, bonjour.
16225600	16228600	You can come closer and say that.
16228600	16229600	Soon, all of...
16229600	16232600	Italy, I will be speaking to.
16232600	16235600	Very sensibilities.
16240600	16243600	It's so nice of them to wait one by one to attack you.
16243600	16246600	I know they have such good manners, honestly.
16248600	16251600	Mommy, want to explore that?
16251600	16255600	I read the funniest thing ever.
16255600	16258600	And if you know, you know.
16258600	16263600	It was like, what happens if they take my boy cherry?
16263600	16267600	And it was like, story will leave you thinking it's...
16269600	16271600	I was cackling, reading that.
16271600	16273600	I was like...
16274600	16276600	I wish you a lot of fun playing Brotherhood.
16276600	16279600	Going to watch the stream later in the day.
16279600	16281600	Until all of you have fun watching.
16281600	16283600	Good night, rest well, sweet dreams.
16283600	16285600	Thanks for hanging in.
16290600	16291600	Okay, right.
16291600	16293600	Look at the speed of this horse.
16293600	16297600	These horses are so much slower.
16297600	16300600	What did you mean by that?
16300600	16302600	Development team of Brotherhood.
16302600	16307600	By making the white horse the slowest and the black horse the fastest.
16307600	16309600	What did you mean by that?
16309600	16310600	Do you want to elaborate?
16310600	16311600	No?
16311600	16312600	No?
16312600	16313600	Okay.
16314600	16316600	Something rather odd.
16316600	16318600	Rather odd about that.
16318600	16321600	But then again, it could just be coincidence.
16321600	16326600	But then, is it coincidence if you go up to like...
16326600	16331600	The tan horse is faster than the brown horse is faster than the black ones the fastest.
16338600	16342600	Should we be offended by a game that was made 14 years ago?
16342600	16344600	So deep!
16344600	16346600	It reaches out in the mountains!
16354600	16356600	Don't let the game journalists hear me.
16356600	16357600	Oh no!
16357600	16359600	It's candle to be...
16367600	16369600	I miss when they can gallop.
16369600	16370600	You can still gallop.
16370600	16371600	You have to hold A.
16371600	16375600	But the problem with galloping is if there's people in the way your horse will fall over.
16379600	16381600	Canceled on first game stream.
16381600	16385600	Wait, why would I get cancelled if I point out what the development did?
16385600	16386600	Why am I getting...
16386600	16387600	Hold on a minute.
16387600	16388600	No, no, no.
16388600	16389600	You can't cancel me.
16389600	16391600	My views do not reflect to be a lawyer agency!
16393600	16394600	I just screamed that.
16394600	16397600	Right, this is my only gripe.
16397600	16400600	This is my only gripe with this mission.
16400600	16404600	You get left at the gate here only...
16404600	16410600	I repeat, you get left at the gate here only to have to horse your way back to the villa
16410600	16416600	when the last mission just got you from the barracks to there.
16416600	16419600	So you've literally just gone back to like what you just did.
16419600	16421600	That's my only gripe.
16422600	16423600	That's right with that.
16423600	16424600	On the end.
16425600	16426600	Oh, I should do.
16426600	16427600	It is smart.
16427600	16431600	Like just me going for like 30 minutes ear to ear.
16431600	16432600	What was that noise?
16432600	16433600	Was that a door?
16433600	16434600	I sounded like...
16439600	16442600	Once inside, your men can overpower the camp's patrols, correct?
16442600	16443600	Yes, but...
16443600	16446600	Especially if the patrols are taken completely by surprise.
16446600	16447600	Yes.
16449600	16451600	My ankle, I'm sitting on it.
16451600	16452600	Funny, I can't believe it.
16452600	16453600	We are going to walk, right?
16453600	16455600	That person grunting?
16455600	16456600	Literally, man.
16456600	16459600	Cody, you're truly a man after my order.
16459600	16461600	I'm going to burp, I'm so sorry.
16462600	16464600	Oh, that was a...
16464600	16465600	Maybe burp.
16465600	16467600	My troops will gather it from the day.
16467600	16469600	Should have been a frog V to burp.
16469600	16471600	That would have been very good.
16471600	16474600	Oh, could have been a hypofrog, honestly.
16475600	16477600	Do you ever sit normally?
16478600	16480600	I honestly cannot sit in a normal chair.
16480600	16483600	Maybe I should do a foot cam, like a thigh cam stream.
16483600	16487600	And it's just me showing you how badly I sit, like the entire time.
16487600	16490600	I thought a foot cam stream during a horror game would be funny
16490600	16492600	because you can watch me shake my ankles.
16492600	16497600	And I also have a thing where I press my toes into the ground.
16497600	16501600	Like, I literally have like little indents on my toes
16501600	16503600	from where I press them into the ground
16503600	16506600	because of the way my, like, toes like, form over on it.
16506600	16509600	I know it sounds really silly, but, you know...
16510600	16512600	Sometimes you don't pick the rotism.
16512600	16514600	And the rotism picks you.
16517600	16518600	Um...
16518600	16520600	And we've got three so far.
16523600	16524600	That would actually be funny.
16524600	16526600	Okay, I'm down for it.
16526600	16529600	Wait, okay, my guy's already gone.
16529600	16532600	How about five cents on you?
16533600	16536600	I don't want to get caught because we can easily 100% this.
16536600	16539600	But the assassin recruits take so long.
16539600	16541600	Okay, thankfully they got caught in the...
16541600	16544600	Whoa, we're getting action shots, like the horse...
16544600	16545600	What? Okay.
16545600	16546600	Let them get up.
16546600	16548600	Look, look, they're a new recruit.
16548600	16549600	Let them get up, let them get up.
16551600	16554600	Is the other assassin gonna try and help or...?
16555600	16556600	No.
16556600	16558600	He's just letting them get absolutely lanced.
16559600	16561600	Right, I'll help him out.
16561600	16563600	Oh, she's losing health, I don't like that.
16563600	16565600	There, right, go kill the other guy now.
16566600	16568600	No, I got these...
16568600	16570600	I got discovered because of that.
16570600	16572600	Okay, whoa, we need to help.
16572600	16574600	We need to help, they're too strong.
16574600	16576600	This guy's too strong.
16576600	16579600	Whoa, whoa, whoa, not the horse, not the horse, not the horse.
16579600	16582600	And the boss, and the boss, get him in the boss, hit him in the boss.
16582600	16584600	Hit him in the boss, like, don't speak to...
16585600	16587600	Okay, okay, okay, okay, horse, it's fine, it's fine.
16587600	16589600	I don't know how to go against the horse.
16590600	16591600	Please leave me alone.
16592600	16594600	I don't know how to deal with horses.
16594600	16595600	Okay, there we go.
16595600	16597600	Okay, we're dealing with a crossbow ball.
16597600	16598600	Jeez.
16600600	16603600	Rank 10 assassins are so good, honestly.
16604600	16607600	We are very slowly leveling them up.
16608600	16610600	I'm wanting to try and pick a fight.
16610600	16611600	Can I pick a fight?
16611600	16612600	Ooh, feather.
16613600	16616600	Look how daintily I jumped over that, that was beautiful.
16616600	16617600	Oh, are you stuck?
16617600	16618600	Are you okay?
16618600	16619600	Have you heard about this?
16619600	16620600	Have you heard about this jump?
16620600	16621600	Hey, there we go.
16621600	16623600	Right, we're going to upset these guys.
16623600	16625600	Oh, okay, never mind, okay.
16625600	16627600	Wait, that's a barrier?
16628600	16630600	That's a barrier.
16630600	16632600	Can you jump over them?
16632600	16634600	Whoa, I've never seen that before.
16634600	16636600	Right, okay, we're going to upset these guards on purpose.
16636600	16637600	So we can...
16638600	16639600	Ouch!
16639600	16642600	I didn't expect that, jeez.
16642600	16644600	Oh my goodness.
16644600	16647600	I just got double whammy right off the bat.
16647600	16648600	Oh my...
16648600	16649600	Right, okay.
16649600	16651600	I need to take the big guy.
16651600	16654600	Thank you, big guy, for perishing.
16654600	16656600	Can't handle you.
16656600	16657600	Okay, how about that?
16659600	16660600	Yeah, big...
16660600	16661600	Oh, we need one more.
16661600	16663600	Right, who's going to perish?
16663600	16665600	You are going to perish.
16667600	16670600	Oh, see the horses are getting stuck here.
16670600	16672600	I don't know where I'm supposed to go now.
16672600	16673600	Oh, I'm good.
16674600	16676600	I predict a riot.
16676600	16678600	Ooh, do you not want to go down there
16678600	16680600	because it's such a nightmare getting out there.
16682600	16684600	How many steps is that?
16688600	16690600	I don't even think I've done a double kill yet.
16690600	16692600	I'm probably going to have to wait till the air stops.
16692600	16694600	I'm going to have to go back to the barracks.
16694600	16696600	I'm riding a horse and I'm going to go back to the barracks.
16698600	16700600	Oh, I'll most likely do a full playthrough
16700600	16703600	of Esu's storyline.
16703600	16705600	Where am I going?
16706600	16707600	Have you seen this?
16710600	16712600	Okay, wait, I'm just being deaf.
16713600	16716600	Ooh, right, we're going to do this Borgia Tower.
16725600	16727600	That's a lot of guards.
16731600	16734600	Are we going to hit by Border Patrol?
16736600	16738600	We're going to get you.
16740600	16745600	And then we're going to just sneak up here and kill you.
16747600	16750600	Okay, I'll take that.
16750600	16752600	Do you guys need help?
16752600	16754600	I'll give you a second recruitment beam
16755600	16757600	and let you guys fight it out.
16757600	16762600	And I'm going to climb up here and do this.
16762600	16764600	Do we skip up here?
16764600	16766600	I cannot play Assassin's Creed 1.
16766600	16767600	I absolutely suck at it.
16767600	16768600	I am so sorry.
16768600	16770600	I cannot do it.
16770600	16772600	I've tried Beyond Belief.
16772600	16774600	I ended up watching someone else play it
16774600	16776600	just so I know the storyline.
16776600	16778600	Beyond Belief, I'm absolutely trash.
16779600	16784600	I probably...
16784600	16786600	No, I'm doing variety,
16786600	16789600	but what I'll probably do running up to October 10
16789600	16795600	is I'll play Assassin's Creed 2 before it,
16795600	16798600	then October 10, play Brotherhood again,
16798600	16801600	and then after play Revelations,
16801600	16803600	and then we'll get the full Ezio story.
16804600	16809600	Sometimes it doesn't engage in combat mode,
16809600	16812600	and then the enemies get a free hit on you
16812600	16814600	because there's nothing you can do.
16814600	16816600	I don't know why it does it.
16816600	16818600	I mean, I don't know why it does it,
16818600	16820600	because stuff and things, but...
16823600	16825600	We're level 4.
16825600	16828600	We're getting a little bit decent.
16828600	16829600	It's not the best.
16829600	16831600	We're really not that strong.
16831600	16833600	Plumping it all into armor
16833600	16835600	because I get so nervous for them.
16836600	16838600	I don't want to do a level 4.
16838600	16840600	Maybe a 3?
16840600	16842600	Send 2 on a level 3
16842600	16845600	and split the XP, which is like 100 each.
16845600	16847600	Yeah.
16847600	16848600	Oh, a second one?
16848600	16850600	Okay, we'll do that.
16850600	16852600	Okay, that's some all sent to get...
16852600	16854600	Oh, my tummy rumbled.
16855600	16857600	My tummy rumbled.
16857600	16859600	Make me to get some...
16859600	16860600	Oh, my tummy rumbled again.
16860600	16862600	I don't know if I was getting picked up in the mic,
16862600	16864600	but yeah, I think I'm getting a bit peckish
16864600	16866600	for, like, actual things.
16866600	16869600	You know, sometimes a meat stick doesn't do it.
16869600	16871600	Sometimes you need more.
16872600	16874600	That...
16874600	16876600	There's so many jokes I can make,
16876600	16877600	but they're too easy.
16877600	16878600	I'm just going to leave it.
16878600	16880600	Actually, I'm going to buy smoke bomb pouch if I can.
16882600	16885600	It's 9000 Florence!
16885600	16888600	Who has 9000 Florence?
16889600	16891600	Unreal.
16891600	16892600	Unreal Engine.
16892600	16894600	Who has 9000 Florence?
16894600	16895600	Not me.
16896600	16898600	Yeah, two me say.
16898600	16900600	You know what they say?
16900600	16902600	None in the pink.
16902600	16904600	All in the stink.
16907600	16908600	Oh, 9000!
16908600	16910600	Okay, we're going to get a smoke bomb.
16910600	16912600	Excuse-moi, excuse-moi.
16912600	16914600	J'ai vu du smoke bomb de pouch.
16914600	16916600	Pouch de smoke bomb?
16916600	16918600	Smoke bomb de pouch?
16918600	16920600	No, not the knife belt.
16920600	16922600	Okay, we have smoke bombs, almost.
16922600	16925600	We, a viewer, are not serving the talents.
16925600	16926600	Okay.
16929600	16930600	I can't believe...
16930600	16934600	I actually don't get enough of a cut or a split
16934600	16936600	that I can't even afford to...
16936600	16938600	Oh, there's an assassin recruit down here.
16938600	16940600	Yes, I will help you!
16940600	16942600	No, let me help you!
16942600	16943600	Oh, it's a lady.
16943600	16945600	Oh, my lady.
16945600	16948600	We actually need to smoke bomb
16948600	16951600	because we need to kill people in a smoke bomb.
16952600	16955600	For, uh, why...
16955600	16956600	What?
16956600	16959600	Why do they just get aggressive on us?
16961600	16963600	Sometimes you need a group of meat sticks.
16963600	16964600	A smart booth.
16964600	16965600	Who said that?
16965600	16967600	Who said that?
16967600	16969600	Maud just put them on a warning.
16969600	16972600	Whoever insinuates that the A smart booth
16972600	16975600	is going to be utilized for anything but tingling.
16976600	16978600	Put them on a warning.
16978600	16979600	Don't.
16979600	16981600	Teasing.
16983600	16985600	I'm teasing.
16985600	16987600	I actually think I might need to get...
16987600	16990600	I, like, I never noticed that I'm, like, hungry or need to pee,
16990600	16992600	and then as soon as I notice it, I'm like,
16992600	16995600	ah, I'm perishing, I'm perishing.
16995600	16998600	Maud's failed this man's tax return.
16998600	17000600	Oh, my God, I cannot wait to...
17000600	17003600	I have a funny short coming out about, like,
17003600	17006600	what you can get taxed back in a VTuber agency.
17006600	17009600	Uh, you know my doughnuts on rewards?
17009600	17013600	One of them's going to be a length chart.
17013600	17016600	I get to submit that for tax back
17016600	17020600	because it's what I needed to do
17020600	17022600	in order to operate.
17022600	17025600	Like, it's crazy what you can get in tax back.
17025600	17028600	Like, obviously it doesn't mean I get the full price of it back in taxes.
17028600	17031600	No, it just means, like, the...
17031600	17035600	It's like, okay, you can get a few, like, $2 back on your tax return.
17035600	17036600	It's like, I think.
17036600	17038600	Thanks, appreciate it.
17038600	17041600	But, like, yeah, you can get tax back on models,
17041600	17044600	get tax back on equipment, get tax back on internet,
17044600	17047600	get tax back on, uh, rent as well.
17047600	17052600	I get tax back on paying your tax, the stream.
17052600	17057600	Oh, I don't even want to think about taxes, honestly.
17057600	17060600	Although it was pretty, pretty...
17060600	17061600	It reduces what you owe.
17061600	17064600	Yes, it doesn't mean I'm going to, like, get the full thing back.
17064600	17068600	Sorry, sometimes when people talk about tax back,
17068600	17072600	it sounds like they mean you get the full thing back,
17072600	17074600	which is not the case at all.
17074600	17077600	Everything is a business, right, of, like,
17077600	17080600	if you can justify it 100%, like,
17080600	17083600	because I can, like, imagine a vealer got audited
17083600	17085600	and I have to go, like, oh, yeah, you know,
17085600	17088600	this special artwork, um, that was part of the business
17088600	17091600	because we're an entertainment business.
17091600	17094600	It would be hilarious.
17094600	17098600	ASMR Girl IRS agent interrogates you.
17098600	17100600	Wait, what am I doing?
17100600	17102600	Oh, right in the balls, right?
17102600	17103600	Oh!
17103600	17105600	Wait, why did...
17105600	17106600	Oh!
17106600	17108600	Did I just break?
17108600	17109600	Oh, my God.
17109600	17110600	I'm sorry, I really just...
17110600	17113600	Like, the Lance men.
17113600	17117600	Small poles only, please, my goodness.
17117600	17120600	They're so hard to defeat.
17120600	17122600	The company has an account and does everything legally.
17122600	17123600	It's by Otonus.
17123600	17126600	Okay, dude.
17126600	17128600	Management.
17128600	17132600	Actually, there's an account and that's true.
17132600	17136600	Small poles only, so ogre.
17136600	17139600	Wait until he'll tell you about my doctor's visit.
17139600	17142600	That's for a later stream.
17142600	17147600	You tell it in, like, raw 4K detail about, like, what occurs.
17155600	17156600	Right, what am I supposed to do?
17156600	17158600	Follow Bartolomeo and his mercenaries.
17158600	17159600	Okay.
17159600	17162600	Okay, he's about to activate this next thing.
17162600	17168600	I am now to perish the guards of my own death gold.
17168600	17172600	So this guy can go first.
17172600	17176600	And then I can do you.
17176600	17182600	And then, last but not least, I can do you.
17182600	17183600	No.
17183600	17186600	Don't be silly, Ezio.
17186600	17190600	Aim on the guard, my goodness.
17190600	17192600	By the way, this came...
17192600	17193600	What?
17193600	17196600	Hello?
17197600	17199600	Hello?
17199600	17203600	I got desynchronized, but I did what you asked.
17203600	17208600	I did everything right and I still lost.
17208600	17211600	Wait, this isn't the original checkpoint.
17211600	17212600	We still...
17212600	17219600	Wait, we hit the checkpoint and it let us go through.
17219600	17222600	Okay, okay, okay, I'll take it.
17226600	17228600	Okay, next guard checkpoint.
17228600	17230600	There's one to our left.
17230600	17233600	I might go kill him the new.
17233600	17235600	Good day to you.
17235600	17237600	Please stop walking.
17237600	17239600	Thank you.
17239600	17243600	Okay, there's a second guard there.
17243600	17247600	I really want to get...
17247600	17250600	I need them to split up.
17250600	17251600	Focus, focus.
17251600	17257600	Focus, there's a pizza on your focus.
17257600	17259600	I was too in range.
17259600	17263600	If I can time this right, I'm not going to desync.
17263600	17265600	I did it.
17265600	17266600	Did you see that, though?
17266600	17267600	The AI looked at me.
17267600	17269600	Oh, my goodness, right?
17269600	17270600	What way are you going, Bartolomeo?
17270600	17272600	You're going this way.
17272600	17277600	That was the way.
17277600	17280600	I'm French.
17281600	17284600	Freeacak...
17284600	17286600	Don't make me sleep!
17286600	17288600	I am a French.
17288600	17291600	I am a Frenchman.
17291600	17295600	I am not Italian or an assassin.
17295600	17298600	Ooh, I don't know how...
17298600	17300600	But we did get desync to do that.
17301600	17303600	We made it which is a funny thing.
17303600	17306600	I have a guard right here.
17306600	17308600	I don't remember this part.
17308600	17315600	All right, you perish. I've got two guards next to each other. I don't like...
17315600	17320600	Oh, he's coming this way! Oh, there's a dead body!
17320600	17324600	Oh, okay. It's fine.
17324600	17327600	Oh, no, he's gone for the dead body!
17327600	17332600	I didn't think that through. That was very lucky that we didn't desync all there.
17332600	17336600	Phew, we did it. The hard part's over. Now it's for the easy part.
17336600	17339600	Where we just walk up to this gate.
17339600	17347600	And then we get to learn how French people say Italian dog, which is chien du talien!
17347600	17353600	Are you gonna have any European-friendly streams?
17353600	17360600	Like, you mean start an earlier than the time I stream right now?
17361600	17365600	This is probably going to be my stream start time until...
17365600	17369600	Daylight savings kicks in for some places.
17372600	17374600	Which part of France are you from?
17374600	17376600	Montréal!
17382600	17384600	Montréal!
17384600	17386600	Open the gate!
17392600	17394600	It's E-friendly. It started at 8 p.m.
17394600	17399600	It's a bit late if you're, like, German ahead one, or...
17402600	17406600	Is this a European-unfriendly stream? Like, do we not like them?
17406600	17411600	No, we do. It's just time zones. Like, it's 4 a.m. when I start streaming.
17411600	17414600	So, I'm doing my best.
17414600	17419600	But I'm an endurance streamer, so I do hit a lot of time zones.
17419600	17426600	And it's unlikely, like, reeflings have, like, 8 hours to set, like, through an entire stream.
17426600	17429600	Like, maybe if you work from home, or you're listening at work,
17429600	17432600	but it's a bit dangerous listening at work, because sometimes I tease a lot.
17432600	17436600	Like, especially in ASMR streams, I tease quite a lot.
17436600	17439600	This is me just having a really good time.
17439600	17442600	So, I'm pretty tame right now, from Brotherhood.
17444600	17446600	Repsleepska. Yeah.
17446600	17448600	If you live in Turkaya...
17450600	17453600	Arkadijim! Arkadijim!
17453600	17455600	Means friend.
17455600	17458600	And... Turkay.
17459600	17461600	I think.
17461600	17463600	Enough of your crap.
17463600	17465600	Release my wife.
17465600	17469600	Such entitlement from a man born with nothing to his name.
17469600	17472600	Mine is worth its currency.
17472600	17476600	I work from home, and your endurance streams probably end when your work starts.
17476600	17478600	So, I'm definitely gonna be...
17478600	17481600	How can you focus on working, listening at the same time, though?
17481600	17485600	Unless it's, like, background noise. That's different.
17485600	17490600	Arkadijim! I learned that from Assassin's Creed Revelations, because it's set in Turkey.
17491600	17493600	Never learn.
17500600	17503600	These guys are, like, the hardest enemies you can kinda get.
17503600	17506600	But if you just jump at them, you can get away with it.
17506600	17510600	Well, you just gotta break their stance, and just lick that down.
17510600	17512600	And back to me.
17512600	17515600	The trick is, I don't really work.
17515600	17519600	So, this cutscene is a glitch that was never patched out.
17519600	17523600	This is a full edited cutscene, where he, like, go get my wife.
17523600	17525600	It never loads. It will never load in time.
17525600	17527600	I have no idea what it looks like.
17527600	17533600	Well, I assume it looks like him, um, screaming at you, and then he gets his sword and goes offscreen.
17533600	17536600	It will never load. It doesn't matter what you do. It never loads.
17536600	17543600	Unless, like, maybe someone went into the game data, and, like, I went into free camera, possibly.
17543600	17545600	Um...
17545600	17547600	Then you could definitely do it.
17547600	17550600	I said small poles only!
17552600	17554600	We don't want them being p-
17554600	17556600	No! You've ruined my speed!
17557600	17560600	Okay. We did it, though. It's fine.
17561600	17563600	Can I open the gate, please?
17563600	17565600	Become anonymous to open the gate?
17565600	17567600	There's no one attacking me!
17569600	17571600	There's no one attacking me!
17571600	17574600	Right, that's what I thought. I was gonna say, there's literally no one attacking me.
17575600	17580600	You underwaste my lack of shame. I've listened to some pretty sick stuff at work before.
17583600	17587600	Honestly, whatever helps pass the time, like, I'm sorry, but work can be so mundane.
17587600	17592600	Like, the best work days are the times where you're super busy, because you blink, and it's the end of the day,
17592600	17598600	but you are shattered. That's the only problem. Like, you're absolutely exhausted, and it's really...
17599600	17606600	So, you're actually on a timer in this section, and I only have six crossbow bolts, which I do not like at all right now.
17609600	17613600	You can. I might mess up the sequence. I do it quite a lot.
17614600	17616600	Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't look back!
17623600	17625600	Okay, we did it. We did it. We did it. We did it.
17625600	17627600	You need to air assassinate him for 100%.
17629600	17630600	All done.
17633600	17635600	You have no clue how many hours I need to kill in the day.
17641600	17644600	Damn, straight respect is earned and not purchased.
17644600	17645600	Hmm, hmm.
17650600	17653600	Oh, you should probably go to sleep if you need to be up in six hours.
17653600	17655600	It's healthy to get eight hours of sleep.
17656600	17662600	Digi, no. Men need eight hours of sleep, where women typically need ten hours of sleep.
17663600	17665600	But yeah, definitely don't risk your health.
17668600	17670600	Sir Shameless, they call me.
17674600	17677600	I'll be honest, all your girls make my work day go by real quick.
17677600	17680600	It's lovely. Oh, there's some reason to hear.
17682600	17684600	AP Gal confirmed Lord.
17697600	17700600	Oh my god, VTuber streamer parody of that song. Let's go.
17701600	17708600	Okay, then you can collect both of these chests if you're fast enough,
17709600	17711600	whilst it's telling you this act is over.
17712600	17717600	I swear they purposely did this because no other act takes so long to complete the sequence six,
17717600	17719600	like the ending bit to tell you it's over.
17720600	17722600	I decided a long time to destroy my sleep schedule.
17723600	17724600	That's so legal.
17724600	17729600	Forget Paris.
17737600	17738600	Worth it feels good.
17741600	17743600	Sleep. What is that? I don't need to sleep.
17743600	17744600	Oh, she caught me.
17745600	17749600	If I can remember this sequence, we may have to...
17750600	17754600	Oh, that reminds me, there's actually a thieves challenge,
17754600	17759600	which is to dive 200 meters, which you can do off the top of this building.
17759600	17762600	So we might as well do it now because we're pretty high up.
17762600	17763600	Ready, steady.
17766600	17769600	There we go. That's a thieves challenge done right there. Dive complete.
17771600	17774600	Oh, I've got a hiring discount on the thieves. Fantastic.
17775600	17777600	I... well, enjoy that.
17777600	17780600	I need to level them up a bit more before they pickpocket,
17780600	17782600	but we're getting close to the point where we don't...
17784600	17787600	like Moolah, like that. Where'd any go on the map?
17788600	17790600	Where are we? What's our heading?
17791600	17795600	Okay, we've liberated that Borgia zone, which is fantastic.
17795600	17798600	Where's the mission? Is it south?
17798600	17801600	The mission's in the thieves guild,
17801600	17803600	which doesn't have a Borgia place on the way,
17803600	17806600	but we'll start to try and get all the Borgia towers.
17807600	17810600	I'm just going to use the old teleport feature.
17813600	17814600	Yeah, yeah.
17814600	17817600	And we'll send the assassin recruits on the way to get leveled up a bit more.
17818600	17819600	Watching your streams of high level...
17819600	17820600	Can you stop that?
17821600	17822600	Try and make me blush?
17823600	17827600	Like, I'll literally just meme in my butt off playing a really good game.
17828600	17831600	Okay, we've got level 5, so we're starting to get a bit...
17831600	17835600	I'm going to put it in weapons now just so they have a few more things.
17836600	17839600	We need to destroy a tower in order to get our third signal.
17839600	17842600	Can I send you guys?
17846600	17851600	I'm going to send everyone for the purpose of levelling up that level 1.
17852600	17855600	Like, to get them really levelled up from the start.
17855600	17859600	So if they do end up in a fight, it's not a problem.
17861600	17862600	Is it working? Yes.
17863600	17866600	Have you been killing people with your horse?
17867600	17869600	Maybe they do.
17870600	17871600	No.
17872600	17874600	They're not buying it.
17875600	17878600	You buy the horse out there.
17879600	17880600	He looks like the...
17881600	17883600	Oh no, the words aren't working on my head.
17883600	17887600	Please don't shoot me and my friend.
17887600	17890600	He looks up and he remembers.
17890600	17892600	Ooh, I love birds.
17893600	17897600	Not at the bird and people die everywhere.
17897600	17900600	People die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
17900600	17904600	I don't know the words, but like, I know the tune and everything.
17905600	17906600	Mmm.
17910600	17912600	Strongly means the most important meal of the day.
17920600	17924600	We're going to not grab that thief because he's already claimed the wall.
17924600	17926600	I never chase thieves.
17926600	17928600	If they go up the wall, I cannot be bothered.
17928600	17930600	I absolutely cannot be bothered.
17930600	17934600	That's probably the only thing in this game that I'm just like, it doesn't matter.
17934600	17938600	It's just like if you wanted to poke at the money and whatever item is on their persons.
17941600	17943600	What am I doing? What?
17944600	17945600	What, do you want to do?
17945600	17947600	You guys want to do kegels together?
17948600	17950600	Are you ready? Hold for three seconds.
17950600	17953600	One, two, three, release.
17954600	17956600	You know what, you know what I learned about guys?
17956600	17957600	I learned this a while ago.
17957600	17961600	If a guy wants to jumpstart his Eiffel Tower,
17961600	17965600	he has to close his end, which is crazy.
17965600	17969600	A little, a little twitch the, what, twitch it?
17969600	17971600	Just so you can, well, twitch it, I guess, yeah.
17972600	17974600	Which is crazy lore for guys.
17974600	17975600	Absolutely crazy lore.
17977600	17980600	Well, I don't know if I was too generic with that.
17980600	17983600	In order to achieve sword art.
17983600	17991600	Oh, and also when you go with the toilet, you're perlittle.
17991600	17993600	I've sent my men out to find him.
17996600	17997600	What do we call them?
17998600	17999600	You're perlittle.
18002600	18008600	I don't know, double eyeballs can touch the toilet and it's super cold and uncomfortable.
18008600	18012600	I only learned that super recently because I saw a meme about it.
18012600	18013600	And I was like, wait, what?
18014600	18017600	You're perlittle guys.
18017600	18019600	They're going to retract and save you.
18019600	18021600	They get too cold.
18021600	18024600	They're going to go straight back up to your belly button.
18024600	18025600	No.
18028600	18029600	Kill all the attackers.
18029600	18030600	Sure, sure, sure.
18036600	18037600	Wait, why are we in this?
18037600	18038600	Oh, it's a fight.
18038600	18039600	It's a fight.
18039600	18042600	And I just sent all my assassins away.
18048600	18049600	Wrong guy.
18049600	18050600	Wrong guy.
18050600	18052600	You're hurting the wrong guy, Steve.
18052600	18054600	Right, where are the enemies?
18054600	18057600	Got an enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.
18057600	18059600	Enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.
18059600	18061600	Enema, give them an enema.
18064600	18065600	Do not give them an enema.
18066600	18067600	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
18067600	18068600	Whoa.
18068600	18069600	That was so cool.
18069600	18071600	That attack to double splash over.
18071600	18072600	I really enjoyed that.
18084600	18085600	Ah, go away.
18086600	18087600	They scare me.
18087600	18089600	That's a nice, oh, I do have three names.
18089600	18094600	Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy, bad boy, bad boy.
18094600	18095600	Bad boy.
18095600	18096600	Oh, I missed.
18101600	18103600	Okay, let's get this big guard.
18103600	18105600	Oh, wait, I thought I killed him.
18105600	18107600	I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry.
18107600	18109600	I think I'm going to have to get food and refuel in a second
18109600	18113600	because I'm starting to get a little bit delirious.
18113600	18118600	I'm going to get some egg and I think I'll go ravioli.
18120600	18122600	Maybe a wee bit longer, maybe a three.
18122600	18124600	Three whole minutes away from stream.
18124600	18125600	I cannot believe it.
18125600	18126600	I cannot believe it.
18126600	18128600	Absolutely unprofessional, unacceptable.
18131600	18133600	Oh, damn it, sorry.
18134600	18137600	Everybody wants to be in the Assassin's Creed.
18137600	18141600	Brotherhood is really, people quite work with the timing of the song.
18141600	18143600	She hates us now.
18144600	18146600	How long?
18147600	18148600	How many hours?
18148600	18149600	Five hours?
18149600	18151600	Oh, it's been five hours already.
18151600	18153600	I've been gushing about this game.
18153600	18155600	You know what, reflings?
18155600	18157600	Life's good.
18157600	18159600	Full stop, life is good.
18160600	18162600	Got doing my thing.
18162600	18164600	We having a good time mimin' along.
18164600	18168600	I'm rambling away about any old shite that passes my brain.
18169600	18170600	Life is good.
18172600	18175600	We're about to go get some juice.
18175600	18177600	I think I'll make a tea.
18177600	18179600	Yeah, I'll make a tea.
18179600	18182600	You'll get some food, maybe some snacky too.
18183600	18184600	I don't think I need to pee.
18184600	18186600	No, no pee yet.
18188600	18190600	Actually, I should probably gallop, so I'm not that far behind him,
18190600	18193600	because he is like so far ahead of me.
18196600	18197600	Oh, no!
18197600	18198600	My thieves has perished.
18198600	18200600	But thieves are ours.
18201600	18203600	Yonkers, you're mine now.
18204600	18206600	They are, they are...
18207600	18210600	Oh, I don't really want to kick them to death.
18210600	18211600	Like, make it quick.
18211600	18213600	See, oh, don't make them suffer, my goodness.
18214600	18215600	It's a bit morbid.
18215600	18217600	See, oh, when you do that, I've done that.
18217600	18219600	I think I'd rather like make it quick and painless,
18219600	18220600	not like drag it out.
18220600	18221600	Oh, he got the horse!
18221600	18223600	How did he do that?
18224600	18226600	I don't know how he did that, but do it again.
18227600	18229600	It looked like he did it with some...
18232600	18234600	Well, it's 1AM, so I'll take my leave.
18234600	18235600	Please, rest well.
18235600	18240600	Anyone who does have to rest or to sleepy bye-bye, please don't worry.
18240600	18241600	Odds are.
18241600	18243600	I'm actually still going to be streaming by the time you wake up.
18243600	18244600	I said it.
18245600	18246600	Yeah, it's true.
18246600	18247600	It's true.
18247600	18250600	I might finish the campaign and I might want to do some more.
18250600	18251600	It's true.
18251600	18252600	It's true.
18252600	18253600	The accusations are true.
18254600	18256600	So don't worry if you have to go to bed.
18256600	18257600	Might see you when you wake up.
18257600	18258600	So sweet dreams.
18259600	18260600	See you in the morning.
18260600	18264600	Jump off wall.
18264600	18265600	Get kicked into wall.
18268600	18270600	The accusations are true.
18270600	18271600	I'm addicted.
18272600	18274600	But not as much as I'm addicted to you.
18274600	18276600	You guys might have the nicotine patch on your head,
18276600	18280600	but the truth is under these bangs or fringe,
18280600	18282600	I've got a nicotine patch too,
18282600	18284600	and it's covering my entire forehead.
18284600	18291600	I wish I didn't send my sassons on that mission.
18291600	18292600	Whoa.
18293600	18294600	Okay, there we go.
18295600	18296600	This is the Roman bath house.
18296600	18298600	This is based on reveal, please.
18300600	18301600	They are public bath houses.
18303600	18304600	Okay, there's a lot going on.
18304600	18305600	Hold on, there's a lot going on.
18305600	18306600	Hold on.
18306600	18307600	Oh, big armor guy.
18307600	18308600	Big armor guy.
18308600	18309600	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
18309600	18310600	Parish.
18311600	18314600	My notoriety is going up.
18314600	18316600	I like how he just swings that air.
18316600	18317600	Whoa.
18317600	18319600	Okay, can we get him while he's on the floor?
18319600	18321600	Get him on the floor.
18321600	18322600	Ow.
18322600	18324600	Get him on the floor.
18325600	18326600	Lavolpi.
18326600	18327600	Lavolpi.
18327600	18328600	Old man.
18328600	18329600	OG sand.
18329600	18330600	Put your Glex on.
18330600	18332600	Put your Glex on, OG sand.
18332600	18334600	It's me.
18335600	18338600	And he is performing in a play in Stanova.
18338600	18340600	He played in the first Stanova.
18340600	18343600	That was definitely a VA they had used a lot.
18343600	18345600	And they were like, please just use any other voice.
18345600	18347600	It's going to be so obvious it's you.
18347600	18351600	So he had to go stale and play tonight.
18351600	18353600	Or a visa game.
18356600	18357600	I don't have nicotine.
18357600	18358600	I have BLR.
18358600	18360600	That's so good.
18360600	18361600	Sleep is for the weak.
18361600	18362600	I don't know.
18362600	18363600	Sleep is very healthy.
18363600	18366600	And apparently, if you don't sleep regularly,
18366600	18369600	then it's bad for your longevity.
18369600	18371600	And you might expire.
18371600	18375600	I don't really want you to expire in all honesty.
18375600	18377600	I'm going to tell you the truth, chief.
18377600	18379600	I'd rather you didn't expire.
18379600	18382600	So, please don't.
18383600	18386600	We're getting some strawny time, though.
18386600	18389600	You're getting strawny time for a very long time every day.
18389600	18391600	You could be sick of me.
18391600	18392600	Yeah.
18398600	18400600	Oh, the music's so good.
18400600	18402600	There's also a feather on top of the Colosseum,
18402600	18404600	but we can get that at a later time.
18411600	18413600	We expire.
18413600	18415600	Survive for a moment.
18415600	18417600	Not only am I putting you at war,
18417600	18419600	I'm now expiring you manually.
18419600	18421600	You have been expired.
18422600	18423600	Wait, where did he go?
18423600	18425600	Oh, I literally glanced away
18425600	18427600	and he was perfectly hidden behind Ezio.
18427600	18429600	And I was like, oh, where is he?
18430600	18431600	All right.
18431600	18433600	Enemies, enemies, enemies, enemies.
18433600	18435600	Give them an animal.
18435600	18438600	Give the enemies an animal for how much?
18439600	18440600	What the fuck, you know?
18440600	18442600	I'm about, I don't know.
18443600	18445600	I'm definitely needing a quick,
18445600	18447600	a quick five minute break for you guys.
18447600	18449600	We'll just, I'll maybe read some Marshmallows,
18449600	18451600	I'm gonna take five minute break,
18451600	18454600	and I'll eat and restore my hydration levels and stuff.
18454600	18456600	Getting a wee bit delirious.
18456600	18457600	Just a wee bit.
18458600	18460600	Why is there so many guards this time?
18460600	18462600	I don't really recall this game,
18462600	18464600	like this part having so many guards.
18465600	18468600	Oh, there's a guy on the edge over there.
18470600	18472600	Are we all going?
18472600	18474600	Okay, he's stuck.
18475600	18476600	There, okay, there we go.
18476600	18478600	All good, all good in the hood.
18481600	18483600	She's got enemies on the brain, Freudian slump.
18483600	18486600	And I'm gonna give them, sorry,
18486600	18488600	I stuck on my head, it's like a really dumb meme.
18488600	18490600	Can I summon Leonardo?
18490600	18491600	I can.
18491600	18492600	So on these benches,
18492600	18495600	is where you can buy more of Leonardo's inventions?
18499600	18501600	Is there a thing up there?
18501600	18503600	No, it's on the other side.
18505600	18507600	Leave me alone.
18515600	18518600	What did you ask the scrawny animal marriage when?
18518600	18521600	Why are you expecting me to come in the middle of the night?
18521600	18523600	Do you think I won?
18527600	18529600	I drank a good stretch, yeah.
18529600	18532600	Right, we'll finish this sequence
18533600	18536600	because I think this is a quick sequence.
18536600	18538600	I think we're already like pretty much getting through it.
18538600	18541600	We're about to claim the costumes off of enemies.
18542600	18545600	Do you think my assassin recruits had finished the mission?
18551600	18555600	So, Lavalpe is now convinced Marquio Valley is a thief.
18555600	18557600	It is a traitor
18557600	18560600	because the events are synchronized
18560600	18562600	and not too much.
18562600	18564600	Cesare leaves the castle
18564600	18566600	when he could have got tipped off.
18566600	18569600	Marquio Valley uses guards
18569600	18572600	to tell him secrets of the Borgia
18572600	18576600	and Lavalpe finds it just far too suspicious
18576600	18579600	and he's basically telling us
18579600	18584600	if you do not put an end to Lavalpe,
18584600	18588600	to Marquio Valley, I'll do it myself.
18590600	18593600	Which is scary biscuits and scary beans.
18593600	18596600	I'll leave the toes out of the blanket for you.
18596600	18598600	Oh my God, did you hear my voice there?
18598600	18599600	For you.
18599600	18600600	For you.
18600600	18601600	For you.
18601600	18604600	Would you still love me if I sounded like you?
18608600	18610600	I'm wrecking and decking.
18610600	18612600	We're on sequence six.
18612600	18616600	Act six and there's nine acts together.
18616600	18619600	Yes, I right you would.
18620600	18622600	I am still your servant and ally.
18622600	18623600	Which was an accident.
18623600	18625600	Are you demanding that I discount your actions
18625600	18627600	and rely on friendship?
18627600	18629600	I am asking, not demanding,
18629600	18631600	to unite Italia,
18631600	18633600	I must have every institute
18633600	18638600	and if the church does not fall in love,
18638600	18641600	I will eliminate it entirely.
18641600	18643600	You know that I really work for you,
18643600	18644600	not the folk.
18644600	18645600	I can't believe it.
18645600	18647600	You said I'm getting rid of Catholicism.
18648600	18652600	There's only one way I can know that unconditionally now.
18652600	18654600	You intend to kill me.
18654600	18655600	You're most loyal friend.
18655600	18657600	I have friends that try to tell me that Assassin's Creed.
18657600	18658600	Are you letting me go?
18658600	18661600	This Assassin's Creed Brotherhood isn't a good game.
18661600	18662600	You will not regret it.
18662600	18664600	There's so many cool mechanics in Brotherhood,
18664600	18666600	wish they didn't steal the DLC though.
18666600	18669600	God, give me the costumes for the play.
18669600	18672600	It's a shame DLC was really the hype.
18672600	18674600	No one else shall have her.
18674600	18676600	Make doubly sure it's done correctly.
18676600	18679600	He said no one else is allowed to look at it.
18679600	18681600	I obey?
18681600	18684600	Ooh, that's what we should say to Sheebie.
18684600	18685600	We obey.
18685600	18687600	We obey.
18687600	18691600	We obey Sheebie please.
18691600	18694600	Okay, now this horse constantly gets turned around
18694600	18698600	so you really can't be too close to him at all.
18698600	18699600	We obey Sheebie.
18699600	18700600	We obey.
18700600	18701600	We do not question.
18701600	18702600	We obey.
18706600	18708600	Just taking our time with this guy
18708600	18710600	because he's so...
18710600	18713600	He spins around so easily
18713600	18715600	and you can desync so quick.
18719600	18721600	Taking our time.
18721600	18723600	Easy.
18723600	18725600	Use it.
18725600	18728600	Ooh.
18728600	18730600	This might be the longest hailing mission
18730600	18732600	they've actually put in the game.
18732600	18734600	Ahhhh.
18734600	18738600	This entire act is just tailing missions.
18738600	18739600	It's like, tail this person.
18739600	18740600	Now don't get me wrong.
18740600	18743600	I'm not one of those people that complain about the gameplay.
18743600	18745600	Like, if I complained about gameplay,
18745600	18747600	I would rather suggest something else
18747600	18749600	that's supposed to happen.
18749600	18753600	But if you consider all the different types of mechanics
18753600	18755600	or subjects that put in the game,
18755600	18761600	for example, like the lair of Romulis
18761600	18763600	or Leonardo's missions,
18763600	18765600	these are completely alternative.
18765600	18767600	If you're gonna be like,
18767600	18768600	oh, I don't really enjoy tailing missions.
18768600	18769600	I completely understand that.
18769600	18771600	I'm not dogging on your comment, by the way.
18771600	18773600	I'm just discussing it from...
18773600	18776600	If you ever wanted to kind of review it.
18776600	18777600	Oh, by the way, these guards.
18777600	18778600	Useless.
18778600	18781600	Absolutely useless.
18781600	18784600	You can just walk straight in.
18784600	18787600	I think you can also walk past these two
18787600	18790600	if you get into that hay bale.
18790600	18792600	They just forget you exist.
18792600	18793600	They think you're a fart.
18793600	18795600	Oh, whoopsies, whoopsies.
18795600	18797600	Whoopsies, I wasn't paying attention.
18797600	18798600	Whoopsies.
18798600	18801600	So it doesn't matter if the guards spot me.
18801600	18802600	It's not a problem.
18802600	18805600	Although, if I run, it does fulfill the...
18805600	18807600	Can you go in the hay bale?
18807600	18808600	Jeez, my goodness, gravy.
18808600	18809600	It's evil.
18809600	18811600	Are you okay?
18811600	18814600	Well, nerve is nilly, honestly.
18814600	18815600	You can...
18815600	18817600	If they stop looking at me...
18817600	18819600	Yeah, okay, yeah.
18819600	18822600	You hardly have to kill anyone in these kind of things.
18822600	18824600	The game is so forgiving.
18824600	18827600	That's why I absolutely adore about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
18827600	18829600	It is so forgiving.
18829600	18830600	Now, don't get me wrong.
18830600	18832600	You'll still get a few things where they're like,
18832600	18835600	that shouldn't have got me, but yeah.
18835600	18836600	It's so forgiving.
18836600	18837600	So if you hide in the hay bale,
18837600	18838600	wait for this guy to come up,
18838600	18840600	and then send him a...
18840600	18842600	Oh, he doesn't come up.
18842600	18844600	Well, wait for the guy to go away,
18844600	18845600	and then...
18845600	18846600	Yep, there you go.
18846600	18848600	It's so quick.
18854600	18857600	So, he gets on a horse.
18857600	18859600	You're actually supposed to go over here
18859600	18861600	to get on a horse,
18861600	18863600	to continue to follow him.
18866600	18867600	But it's not really obvious.
18867600	18869600	Like, most people would just chase on foot,
18869600	18871600	which is completely doable.
18871600	18873600	But for some reason, they put the horses...
18873600	18875600	A wee bit to the left, and...
18875600	18877600	Yeah.
18878600	18881600	It's a bit harder to recognise.
18881600	18882600	But yeah, definitely this game,
18882600	18884600	if you've never played Assassin's Creed before,
18884600	18886600	I would actually...
18886600	18888600	You'd miss out on the plot of two,
18888600	18890600	which is the start of Itzu's story,
18890600	18893600	but mechanic and forgiveness-wise.
18893600	18895600	If you're not really a strong gamer,
18895600	18897600	Brotherhood definitely is one for you.
18897600	18899600	Um...
18899600	18901600	Ah, my tummy's wobbling if you heard that.
18901600	18903600	You probably can't over-the-game play, actually.
18903600	18904600	Yeah.
18904600	18906600	The fact that you're passionate about the game,
18906600	18907600	it's just...
18907600	18908600	You latch onto something,
18908600	18909600	you can play a game,
18909600	18911600	and you have absolutely no idea what to expect,
18911600	18912600	and then you just adore it.
18912600	18915600	Like, a binding of Isaac is another game.
18915600	18917600	I didn't know what to expect,
18917600	18918600	and, like, the first time I played it,
18918600	18920600	I think I played it for, like, five hours,
18920600	18921600	and can't...
18921600	18924600	He did the turnaround thing he's now supposed to do,
18924600	18926600	and now he's chasing me!
18926600	18928600	Leave me alone!
18928600	18930600	Oh, my God.
18931600	18932600	That was...
18932600	18934600	That was gonna desync so hard,
18934600	18937600	all because he freakin' turned around!
18937600	18939600	I knew you were gonna do that.
18939600	18940600	I warned you guys.
18940600	18943600	He always turns around in this tail-in mission.
18943600	18945600	He gets caught on NPCs,
18945600	18948600	and spins around.
18948600	18950600	It scares me every time.
18950600	18953600	I never expect that...
18953600	18954600	He was chasing me, though.
18954600	18956600	I don't normally expect them to, like,
18956600	18958600	turn around and chase,
18958600	18961600	but I guess if you're close enough, they will.
18963600	18966600	I'm also gonna visit your mum.
18966600	18968600	Um...
18968600	18969600	Have a nice visit.
18969600	18970600	Sorry.
18970600	18971600	I was gonna say something really mean,
18971600	18973600	but I refrained.
18973600	18974600	I was gonna say,
18974600	18977600	I saw her earlier this day.
18977600	18978600	Oh, he's done it again!
18978600	18979600	No way!
18979600	18980600	I'm gonna chat!
18980600	18981600	Don't do that again.
18981600	18982600	Don't do that again!
18982600	18986600	You're giving me a heart attack.
18986600	18987600	Goodness me.
18987600	18989600	A stronghold's off to visit his mum.
18989600	18990600	Doing your mom!
18990600	18992600	Doing, doing your mom!
18992600	18995600	You know he's strictly doing your mom.
18997600	18999600	Um...
18999600	19000600	So...
19000600	19001600	Oh!
19001600	19003600	Please don't attack me.
19003600	19005600	Incredible.
19005600	19007600	Let the recruits deal with it.
19007600	19009600	Oh, this isn't the right way!
19009600	19011600	This isn't the way to victory!
19011600	19012600	To victory!
19012600	19013600	To victory!
19013600	19014600	This ain't the way to victory!
19014600	19016600	My assassins are now...
19016600	19018600	Uh, fighting it out.
19018600	19021600	I hope they're leveled up enough to deal with them.
19021600	19023600	To deal with them, to deal with them.
19023600	19025600	I hope they're leveled up enough to deal with them.
19025600	19029600	Because I don't have any more recruits!
19029600	19030600	Oh, no!
19030600	19033600	I needed recruits to 100% this mission.
19033600	19037600	Can I just stand about and wait for them to reappear?
19037600	19041600	Because I am patient enough to do that.
19041600	19043600	Um...
19043600	19045600	Destruction, destruction!
19048600	19051600	Oh, I wanna play GTA 4 actually.
19051600	19053600	An eco.
19053600	19055600	Want to go bowling?
19055600	19058600	Oh, they didn't come there.
19058600	19060600	One more minute.
19060600	19062600	Oh look, they've lost the health bar.
19062600	19064600	See, that's why I always put it into health.
19064600	19067600	Because they can make as many mistakes as they need to.
19067600	19071600	Wait, why am I getting yellowed?
19071600	19075600	Why am I getting yellowed when my assassin recruits are going ham?
19075600	19078600	Am I not going to be detected? I bloody hope not.
19078600	19080600	Right, that's fine. I can be detected.
19080600	19082600	Who is shooting?
19082600	19085600	What is going on over there?
19085600	19087600	Do you not need to reload?
19087600	19089600	Hello?
19092600	19093600	They just despawned.
19093600	19096600	Okay, well, as long as they're not dead, I guess.
19096600	19099600	Jeez.
19100600	19102600	No, you did not name your...
19102600	19104600	No, you didn't...
19104600	19108600	Bro, someone in chat has named themselves Fondle of Buzum.
19108600	19110600	Frickin...
19110600	19112600	No, I can't see it anymore.
19112600	19114600	Did Mods time you ever for that?
19114600	19116600	That's hilarious.
19116600	19118600	You don't need to tell that.
19118600	19122600	I read that. It was like Fondle of Buzum, Gen Zero B sucky.
19122600	19124600	I don't see it anymore.
19124600	19126600	Mods timed out, it was funny.
19126600	19128600	Unless you were spamming, then get bonked.
19128600	19130600	But that was kind of funny, I have to admit.
19132600	19134600	I almost ran out of time there.
19134600	19136600	I'm too busy reading chat.
19136600	19138600	I literally sounded like a monkey there.
19138600	19140600	I'm not even pretending.
19140600	19142600	I almost ran out of time.
19145600	19147600	Do not turn around again, I'm going to be so upset.
19147600	19150600	I don't think he does it too much in the sequence part.
19152600	19155600	It's the ghost of Christmas pass, Frickin yeah.
19158600	19160600	Yeah.
19166600	19170600	My voice literally can't right now.
19170600	19173600	Oh, he's getting really far ahead actually, hold on.
19173600	19176600	Sorry, I'm just really enjoying reading chat with you.
19176600	19178600	I apologize.
19178600	19183600	Because I remember that people enjoy when they get their stuff read out.
19183600	19186600	I never did my high sing.
19186600	19188600	Could I do the high sing?
19188600	19191600	So, sometimes when I started upstream,
19191600	19194600	I would actually read everyone's name out
19194600	19197600	just to try and be super thankful.
19197600	19201600	Maybe for the ASMR stream we could try it.
19201600	19207600	Because I understand people want to hear their name be said by me.
19207600	19209600	Because it's nice to be acknowledged.
19209600	19215600	Let's not pretend it's not nice to have streamer reply directly type thing.
19215600	19217600	Or like generally discuss it.
19217600	19220600	So maybe in the ASMR stream, like as a one off,
19220600	19223600	I will try my best to like say hi to everyone.
19223600	19225600	You there.
19227600	19229600	That's a lot of enemies.
19229600	19231600	I got enemies.
19231600	19233600	I'm calling in my recruits.
19233600	19236600	Okay, let's get to the fight.
19236600	19238600	Take this.
19238600	19240600	And this.
19240600	19242600	And that.
19242600	19244600	And this.
19244600	19246600	Okay.
19246600	19249600	I actually...
19249600	19254600	I'm gonna heal up and try and pick up a medicine vial.
19254600	19256600	Real names or username?
19256600	19258600	I would not say your real names.
19258600	19261600	I would never encourage anyone to use their real name.
19261600	19267600	On the internet, I name yourself something funny.
19267600	19272600	Or after like a video game for example.
19272600	19274600	Oh, there's no way I'm getting...
19274600	19277600	Is he gonna leave me alone or doesn't he hurt him?
19277600	19282600	I'm gonna hurt you if you come any closer.
19282600	19285600	It's you! You're aimbot!
19285600	19288600	Your armor is not that good, sir.
19288600	19291600	I know for a fact your armor is not that good.
19291600	19293600	Give me my crossbow bolt back right now.
19293600	19295600	I know you have some on your persons.
19295600	19297600	Not the knife.
19297600	19299600	It's not a knife.
19299600	19300600	That's a sword.
19300600	19302600	Yeah, exactly. Give me my crossbow bolt back.
19302600	19304600	That's exactly what I thought.
19304600	19308600	You're not that guy. Trust me, you're not that guy pal.
19308600	19309600	I started doing a marathon.
19309600	19310600	Imagine if you did Arkham Knight.
19310600	19312600	Oh, I did play Batman.
19312600	19314600	I'm gonna play the Batman.
19314600	19316600	Please don't stop and look at me.
19316600	19318600	Please don't stop.
19323600	19326600	The assassin should kill that third guy.
19326600	19328600	What is going on?
19328600	19331600	It's so loud when you guys kill people.
19331600	19336600	Okay, now the whole of Roma knows
19336600	19340600	that you're shooting guns over there.
19340600	19343600	Stranny's not your enemy.
19343600	19345600	Oh my god, it's Fond de la Buzum.
19345600	19348600	Are you gonna role play Azura?
19348600	19350600	In chat?
19354600	19356600	Damn, I hope to see it as long as I play.
19356600	19358600	It's very long.
19358600	19360600	More like can.
19360600	19362600	It's a little arm cannon.
19365600	19368600	I guess you could go through the live-shot participant tab.
19368600	19370600	Wait, I can see a list of everyone watching?
19370600	19372600	No, that's only on Twitch.
19374600	19376600	Maybe at the start of this ASMR.
19376600	19379600	As of one off, because it's just not plausible to keep up.
19379600	19381600	But just as a thank you for showing up,
19381600	19383600	still being here, still meaming around.
19384600	19386600	I haven't played Assassin's Creed,
19386600	19388600	but it seems similar to Arkham Knight.
19388600	19392600	I wouldn't entirely disagree.
19392600	19399600	Very agile, very agility-based.
19399600	19404600	Definitely, you know, hunting around.
19404600	19407600	This 100% is just don't kill anyone.
19407600	19410600	If you scoot your bot all the way along the Colosseum,
19410600	19412600	absolutely no issues.
19412600	19414600	You shouldn't run into any guards.
19414600	19416600	If you do, you can literally just hang off the ledge.
19416600	19418600	I wish I had the climbing glove, though.
19418600	19423600	That Leonardo bench would have came in clutch for this part of the section.
19423600	19426600	But unfortunately...
19426600	19428600	I don't have that.
19428600	19430600	Where am I supposed to go?
19430600	19433600	So the watchpoint is all the way...
19433600	19435600	Oh my god, that stance...
19435600	19437600	It actually looks pretty funny.
19441600	19446600	We're gonna go for this...
19446600	19449600	Whoa, I didn't even realize that guard could see me.
19449600	19451600	What? How could he even see me?
19451600	19453600	We'll go for the viewpoint,
19453600	19456600	and then we will continue with this mission.
19456600	19459600	This act is getting very close to being finished.
19459600	19461600	And then we will have a five-minute break.
19461600	19463600	I will read any marshmallows.
19463600	19466600	So if you want to ask any questions, you're more than can.
19466600	19473600	I did miss some during the 2.0 and the exposing Bielor.
19473600	19476600	Not that it wasn't good enough,
19476600	19478600	but maybe it wasn't on-subject,
19478600	19482600	or didn't quite necessarily relate to me for the 2.0.
19482600	19484600	So I just sent it.
19484600	19486600	So don't worry, I might give that a good week.
19486600	19488600	But you're welcome to ask any questions,
19488600	19490600	and then we will rehydrate.
19490600	19492600	I'm getting a T.
19492600	19494600	My voice is perishing.
19494600	19497600	Right, where am I supposed to go?
19497600	19499600	Over there?
19499600	19502600	There is a feather on top of the Colosseum,
19502600	19504600	but I'm actually happy to just climb up again.
19504600	19506600	Okay, that's where we're supposed to go.
19506600	19510600	Couldn't see it because of the render distance,
19510600	19513600	but that's okay, because this is an older game.
19515600	19518600	If you look at the three dots where it has time stamps
19518600	19521600	and reactions and option to pop out chat,
19521600	19523600	I think it's just chatters that have typed in chat.
19523600	19525600	I didn't know that.
19525600	19527600	I was just going to get you all to be like,
19527600	19529600	hi, and then start reading your name,
19529600	19531600	ear to ear.
19533600	19535600	Senior.
19535600	19537600	I've been waiting away for the last hour.
19537600	19539600	No, you haven't missed a thing.
19539600	19541600	I'm giving away.
19541600	19545600	We are on sequence six,
19545600	19547600	which is...
19547600	19549600	My god!
19549600	19552600	Why has thou forsaken me?
19555600	19556600	Right, heading out.
19556600	19557600	Thank you for hanging.
19557600	19559600	Again, anyone who is watching,
19559600	19561600	you've done so far.
19561600	19562600	You've done well so far.
19562600	19563600	It's five and a half hours.
19563600	19565600	I don't expect you to be here for the film.
19565600	19568600	Please rest when you can.
19568600	19569600	And also,
19569600	19571600	M.E. is streaming ASMR live.
19571600	19572600	If you'd like to check that out,
19572600	19575600	M.E.Bizu, she's linked below in my description.
19575600	19577600	Thank you so much.
19579600	19581600	No more.
19583600	19586600	So please don't be afraid to check out her ASMRs.
19586600	19588600	We are about to finish up the sequence.
19588600	19591600	We just need to eliminate these three guards that come up
19591600	19594600	and then deal with the poison sequence.
19594600	19598600	And then I believe
19598600	19601600	that the sequence is over.
19601600	19605600	We are getting very close to finishing the campaign.
19605600	19607600	Very, very close.
19607600	19609600	Just run all the way around the Colosseum at this section
19609600	19610600	until you get up to the hay bale.
19610600	19611600	There is a treasure chest.
19611600	19612600	I always ignore it.
19612600	19614600	We can always come back for it later.
19614600	19615600	There you go.
19615600	19618600	You can instantly assassinate the hay bale.
19618600	19621600	Oh, it's four targets.
19621600	19625600	Excuse me, such a fakey gamer.
19625600	19629600	Again, crossbow bolts are completely silent.
19629600	19632600	They will not allure anyone
19632600	19635600	to what has happened in the area,
19635600	19637600	which is very nice.
19637600	19641600	Unfortunately, I'm running rather low on crossbow bolts.
19641600	19643600	We are going to wait for this last guy
19643600	19645600	to come out on his own
19645600	19647600	because if you actually go in there,
19647600	19648600	there is a high chance of him
19648600	19651600	just straight up turning around and looking at you.
19651600	19653600	And then you have to replay this little section again.
19653600	19655600	Don't recommend it up to you,
19655600	19657600	but he will notice the body
19657600	19659600	and then you get the perfect kill.
19659600	19661600	I'm going to look at his body
19661600	19663600	just because again, we are a bit low on crossbow bolts.
19663600	19665600	But that's okay.
19665600	19667600	And then you just need to jump down
19667600	19670600	on this little...
19670600	19672600	How do you call it?
19672600	19675600	Hanging.
19675600	19676600	Okay.
19676600	19678600	Or just don't touch any of it
19678600	19679600	and land on your ankles.
19679600	19680600	Perfectly fine.
19680600	19682600	Don't need them.
19682600	19684600	Just completely ignore everything.
19684600	19686600	My goodness.
19686600	19688600	You saw me reach my armor.
19689600	19693600	Just fall to the floor.
19693600	19695600	Literally splat.
19695600	19698600	You may notice that our health bar is increasing
19698600	19701600	even though I'm not buying any new armor or anything.
19701600	19703600	That's because after every act,
19703600	19705600	you unlock a new health bar.
19705600	19710600	So it's not necessary to use your florins on armor,
19710600	19714600	but if you definitely are new to the Assassin's Creed,
19714600	19715600	it helps out so much.
19715600	19716600	It's fantastic.
19716600	19719600	And please utilize the tailor's shops
19719600	19722600	because tailor's shops have pouches
19722600	19725600	that increase how much medicine you can hold,
19725600	19727600	how much throwing knives,
19727600	19730600	how many crossbow bolts, for example.
19734600	19736600	I cannot recommend this game enough.
19736600	19740600	Seriously, it's about eight hours total for campaign.
19740600	19741600	If you just ignore everything,
19741600	19743600	if you want to have a good time and explore,
19743600	19747600	you could easily pump maybe 16 hours.
19749600	19750600	It's good. Good game.
19750600	19752600	Heavily good game.
19753600	19755600	My knees could never do that.
19755600	19756600	No, I don't think anyone's knees
19756600	19758600	could accomplish such a feat.
19758600	19761600	Although, I could have sworn I saw some videos
19761600	19763600	of, like, you know, in Portal 2,
19763600	19765600	like the apparatus that's on the legs
19765600	19768600	to stop any fall damage from occurring.
19768600	19771600	I'm sure someone was, like, developing that tech
19771600	19774600	at one point, like, maybe for Super Soldier,
19774600	19777600	really stuff, but, yeah.
19780600	19781600	Are you on Steam?
19781600	19784600	Yeah, I'm playing Steam right now.
19784600	19786600	I was gonna try and do...
19788600	19790600	do an Xbox Game Pass,
19790600	19792600	but it's not currently on it right now,
19792600	19795600	so we don't get the gamer score.
19802600	19804600	Poison Stinky.
19806600	19809600	Can anyone look up if Cuttlefish have poison?
19809600	19811600	I don't know my lore.
19813600	19814600	Maybe my poison can...
19814600	19817600	Oh, well, I do ink, but is ink poisonous?
19817600	19819600	No, it's a deterrent,
19819600	19821600	because I can be preyed upon.
19821600	19823600	So ink is the Hayden.
19824600	19825600	I can bay.
19825600	19826600	Yeah, I can.
19826600	19828600	You know, I see my teeth, and...
19832600	19834600	I wish I had aim like that, that's cool.
19834600	19837600	Actually, that's a really, uh...
19837600	19839600	I would...
19839600	19840600	No.
19840600	19841600	Maybe.
19842600	19845600	Do you think we could set up axe throwing
19845600	19847600	at a VTuber convention?
19847600	19849600	I feel like that would be so fun.
19850600	19853600	A lot of people, like, can hit the spot or not.
19853600	19855600	I feel like it's so specific.
19855600	19857600	Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus!
19857600	19859600	Pick them up, pick them up!
19860600	19862600	Quite literally, Jesus.
19862600	19864600	Oh, his health is going down because of the poison.
19864600	19866600	I've never noticed that before.
19869600	19870600	Other way.
19870600	19871600	Okay.
19871600	19872600	Sorry, assassin recruits.
19872600	19874600	I'm gonna need you to, like, hurry up
19874600	19875600	and perish these people.
19875600	19877600	Like, right now, Pietro, is...
19877600	19878600	Oh!
19881600	19883600	That's a reefling after I'm done with him
19883600	19885600	in the ASMR booth.
19885600	19886600	Ah...
19890600	19891600	Mmm.
19893600	19895600	If you team up with a company that does axe throwing...
19898600	19900600	Me next, me next!
19904600	19906600	This is me giving you cola
19906600	19908600	to make you feel better.
19910600	19911600	Give me the keys.
19912600	19914600	The castello.
19915600	19916600	Oh!
19916600	19918600	Did I tell you that
19918600	19920600	after Dave...
19933600	19934600	Oh!
19934600	19937600	It's the real traitor!
19937600	19940600	It's not Marcia Valley at all!
19941600	19942600	It's you!
19942600	19944600	Random thief from cutscene.
19945600	19946600	Oh, no!
19946600	19947600	No!
19947600	19948600	No, no!
19948600	19949600	No, no, no!
19949600	19950600	Horse!
19950600	19951600	Please!
19951600	19952600	Please!
19953600	19955600	Oh, I'm getting chased by a horse right now.
19956600	19958600	I don't know, I think if I fail this section...
19959600	19961600	If you jump, you can jump past the guards
19961600	19963600	and the AI no longer targets you, I don't know why.
19963600	19965600	But there's a horse after me
19965600	19966600	and I'm scared!
19967600	19969600	I can hear the horse go in me!
19971600	19972600	Please!
19972600	19973600	Please!
19974600	19975600	Please leave me alone.
19975600	19980480	Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
19980480	19982760	Okay, I think I'm safe from the horse, silly.
19982760	19986720	Come here! Come hither! Come hither!
19986720	19988280	Ugh, move on.
19998200	19999440	Oh, that was...
19999440	20000720	That's awful.
20000720	20005120	I was right. I have to stop Levopi before he gets to Machiavelli.
20005120	20008200	Ah, Levopi's about to kill Machiavelli! Where'd I go?
20008200	20010080	Okay, the green on the map.
20010080	20013200	Do I need a horse? I can't remember the section very well.
20013200	20015440	Ba-bang. Ba-bang.
20015440	20016720	I think I can run.
20016720	20019320	Ba-bang. Ba-bang.
20019320	20025160	If we do not stop Levopi, he literally kills Machiavelli.
20025160	20028720	Now, to 100% this, you're not to swim.
20028840	20030040	No! Don't pick...
20030040	20033200	Oh, for fuck's sake, take the horse then! Jesus!
20034160	20036640	God... Goodness, Gravy.
20037880	20040320	Oh my god, I'm taking the long way around!
20040800	20042320	Ahhhh!
20042320	20044520	Panic! Panic! Panic! Panic! Panic!
20046480	20048200	What are you doing in Seal?
20048200	20052200	Why would you randomly grab that Permanent's horse?
20052200	20053480	Climb the wall!
20053480	20057320	It hit Seal! Please, that's a tamed mission.
20057400	20059880	They stressed me out so much!
20059880	20062920	Please, I just want 100% this, so I never have to do it again.
20062920	20064680	Please, please, please!
20064680	20068120	Oh, why would you randomly take that Permanent's horse?
20072360	20075040	I get too stressed out on tamed missions. I hate them.
20075040	20077200	Here, take this letter.
20077200	20078240	Luton.
20079120	20081840	My god, this is good news.
20081840	20083840	More than you know.
20083840	20086320	I am once again in your death, Ezio.
20086360	20088360	What death is there amongst friends?
20088360	20089840	Trust one another.
20089840	20091120	Yes.
20091120	20092120	Thank you for relaying the message tonight.
20092120	20094360	I'm literally yoinked that Permanent's horse.
20094360	20095280	Calm, Nicolò.
20095280	20096400	Okay.
20096400	20098040	Love all pain and mark your will.
20098040	20101240	I heard Nicolò's impassioned play took an unexpected turn this week.
20101240	20102560	Now trust each other.
20102560	20103320	Yippee!
20103320	20107840	It seems Jezu Cristo was resurrected three days early.
20110240	20111440	Ta-da!
20112680	20115040	Checkpoint reached. That's not the end?
20115040	20116760	Oh, it is the end of the act.
20116760	20118760	We're just being teased.
20120520	20123360	Crazy Man's Steel's horse jumps off and runs up wall fight.
20123360	20128720	Literally, if you hit, like, a graphic thing like this at an angle,
20128720	20132240	Ezio refuses to climb the wall
20132240	20134320	and it gives me a heart attack every time.
20134320	20135840	Like, Ezio, please.
20138040	20139440	Look, our thieves are in the...
20139440	20141640	Our recruits are in the background.
20143000	20144440	Look, it's you in the background!
20144480	20145760	It's you in the car scene!
20145760	20148360	Well, they're not right now. I can't see them, but...
20153360	20154920	It is pain.
20154920	20157960	Claudia's gonna become an assassin.
20161640	20164360	We work in the dark to serve the light.
20166720	20169680	Yeah, absolutely cannot say any of those words.
20169680	20172160	Do not ask me to recite that.
20172160	20173480	I can say that part.
20174320	20177240	We're in our training. Oh, my God, look who you are! Reflinges!
20177240	20179440	There's so many of you.
20179440	20181640	Look, Reflinges is my sister.
20183920	20185320	I'm reciting it right now.
20196960	20198560	Oh, my God, they're gonna hold hands.
20198560	20199840	Yay!
20199840	20201480	She's an assassin.
20201480	20204760	If you get an assassin, you have to be branded on your
20204760	20206640	wedding ringer...
20206640	20207760	wedding finger.
20209160	20210240	Where the ring goes.
20212280	20213800	Is your sister single?
20213800	20214920	Hi, Claudia.
20216240	20219720	You and I have not seen eye-to-eye on many issues.
20219720	20220720	Just letting out.
20220720	20223080	But you are exactly what the order means.
20223080	20224280	We cannot promote it.
20224280	20226880	You have led the charge against the Templars
20226880	20229160	and rebuilt this brotherhood.
20229160	20232360	Now, we must put Ezio when he be locked up.
20232360	20233480	Refling!
20233480	20237080	Oh, my God, is Reflinges crowning me as their Ushides?
20237080	20239920	Ezio, Auditore, Daffy Vence.
20239920	20242800	You will now be known as Il Mentore,
20242800	20245360	the guardian of our order and our cities.
20247640	20249280	No, I can't be Kama Ushii.
20249280	20252280	I don't mean Ushii, but Kama Ushii is impossible to live up to.
20252280	20253480	That's not possible.
20253480	20254960	Remember, nothing is true.
20254960	20255880	It's true.
20255880	20257680	Everything is permanent.
20257760	20261360	Where other men are limited by morality and law.
20261360	20264120	Remember, everything is permitted.
20266960	20268400	It's Ezio before or after.
20268400	20269240	He is after.
20269240	20270720	Altair is like...
20271720	20273720	I don't even know what century Altair is.
20274840	20276440	Why this sudden change of heart?
20276440	20277760	I'm a cameo assassin.
20279120	20281600	I was the one who brought you to Roma
20281600	20284600	and the one who caused the explosion as you fled the Castello.
20284600	20285520	What?
20285520	20289920	The mercenaries who protected you at Il Colosseo were mine as well.
20289920	20291560	You just did not know it.
20291560	20295240	Maestro Mattiaveli, Cesare has returned to Roma alone.
20295240	20296960	He rides for the Castel Sant'Angelo.
20296960	20297800	Thank you.
20298880	20300720	Well...
20300720	20303440	The decision is yours, not mine.
20303440	20307600	Niccolo, you better not stop telling me what you think.
20307600	20311640	Why else would I seek the opinion of my most trusted advisor?
20311640	20313520	Go kill them, Mentore.
20313560	20314840	Finish what you start.
20315680	20316680	Good advice.
20319520	20322200	I can write a book about you one day.
20322200	20324120	If you do, it will be short.
20324120	20325800	You've been my OSHA since day one, just accept it.
20325800	20328240	I don't get it, like how?
20328240	20329680	How?
20329680	20333880	You tell me you've consumed all of these content creators
20333880	20335440	and you're like...
20335440	20336640	Yeah.
20336640	20337600	That one.
20337600	20338520	Out of them all.
20338520	20339360	Okay.
20340360	20342480	We have finished Sequence Seven.
20342480	20347600	There are two more sequences and then we've done the campaign.
20347600	20349720	It's actually finishing a lot earlier than I thought.
20349720	20353080	I've still got a couple of more hours in me, okay?
20353080	20354760	When it clicks, it clicks.
20354760	20355800	You don't pick the OSHA.
20355800	20357480	The OSHA does pick you.
20360240	20361760	When you know, you know.
20361760	20363400	Wait, the game is really that short.
20363400	20366840	If you ignore everything and do campaign only,
20366840	20369800	like, send it on the campaign, then...
20369800	20371960	On it, right?
20371960	20372800	Pretty.
20372800	20374000	You can wrap up.
20375520	20377240	Real quick.
20377240	20381720	I am going to destroy another tower
20381720	20385720	because I want to unlock this third signal
20385720	20388440	and then we will...
20388440	20389720	Actually, you know what?
20389720	20393160	I'm going to send my assassins on a mission.
20393160	20396520	I'm going to pee and make a cup of tea and get some food.
20396840	20399400	And we can just take a little five minutes to ourselves.
20399400	20400800	A little tea break.
20402760	20405080	I'll send some of the wee...
20405080	20407600	Oh, that's like everyone for that one mission.
20408960	20411880	No ideal, but it's fine.
20411880	20413000	Can you 100% not?
20413000	20414720	You can, so that will be a level up.
20414720	20416000	Okay.
20416000	20419000	Right, everyone.
20419000	20420440	I don't want to be too close to the pigeons
20420440	20422360	because they literally go...
20422360	20425520	in your ear, so hopefully that's not too bad
20425520	20427760	for ambience.
20427760	20430760	Everyone, please do consider standing up
20430760	20434600	and getting your wee legs and blood flow going
20434600	20435600	or wiggle your toes.
20435600	20437480	If you're that lazy, stretch your feet
20437480	20438880	and pull them back and forth
20438880	20441960	so your muscles and your calves
20441960	20443600	like come back and forth.
20443600	20446320	Go for a pee, get some water, some snacks,
20446320	20449400	some juicy juice, hypotenuse,
20449400	20454400	and I will be back in roughly three minutes.
20455160	20459040	I'm gonna try and heat up ravioli like fast as anything.
20460560	20461800	So I will be a moment.
20461800	20464720	If you would like to watch Emmy while she does ASMR live,
20464720	20466160	her link is in my description.
20466160	20468440	You can do that right now, okay?
20468440	20470960	I will do the old pretending to sleep
20470960	20473920	and then I'll open up the game again, okay?
20473920	20475360	So don't worry.
20475360	20477400	Don't worry about it.
20477400	20478560	Eesh.
20478560	20479400	Eesh.
20480760	20481880	It caused my eyes.
20484400	20485360	Eesh.
20514400	20515240	Eesh.
20544400	20545240	Eesh.
20574400	20575240	Eesh.
20604400	20605240	Eesh.
20634400	20635240	Eesh.
20664400	20665240	Eesh.
20694400	20695240	Eesh.
20724400	20725240	Eesh.
20754400	20755240	Eesh.
20784400	20785240	Eesh.
20814400	20815240	Eesh.
20844400	20845240	Eesh.
20874400	20875240	Eesh.
20904400	20905240	Eesh.
20934400	20935240	Eesh.
20956240	20957080	Oh.
20959480	20960760	I had no idea I left eights.
20960760	20961760	He was sitting like that.
20961760	20962760	That was crazy.
20963720	20966680	I was like, oh, we already had a recruits come back as well.
20967800	20969120	Okay.
20969120	20972160	I've got me, I've got all my food.
20972160	20977160	I have a bowl and it has race pea snacks.
20977400	20982400	It has two stick meat and one, eight and two egg.
20985120	20986720	I'm just gonna send this assassin away
20986720	20989000	to get like even more stronger.
20989720	20993720	Because we're cained again to that heart.
20993720	20994560	Jesus.
20994560	20995400	Is there any level three?
20995400	20996240	This is my goodness.
20996240	20997960	That took a while to find.
20997960	21001480	Oh, she went, oh, how long are they?
21003040	21004320	Yeah.
21004320	21006120	I'm like absolutely feasting.
21006120	21008440	I've got fruit juice with me.
21008440	21010720	I've got a bottle of water.
21010720	21013960	I've got a cup of tea with honey in it.
21013960	21017640	Like, oh, oh, not again.
21017640	21020040	I say, oh, would you stop doing that?
21020040	21021600	You're embarrassing me.
21022520	21024560	We're driving this controller.
21027920	21029920	So I'm gonna like munch and play,
21029920	21031320	but I didn't bring any napkins.
21031320	21033960	So I might have to suck the egg out of the bowl,
21033960	21038960	which sounds bizarre, but can you say the second drink again?
21039640	21040960	The fruit juice?
21040960	21042840	It's like, it's got mango in it.
21042840	21044520	It's like super healthy juice.
21046520	21048040	And a cup of tea.
21050040	21051520	Wait, you can't, what?
21053080	21054520	What, a bottle of water?
21054520	21055520	Oh, a bottle of water.
21055520	21058840	I didn't say it like the British say it, well,
21058840	21061440	I consider the British, the English,
21061440	21063480	and the memes like kind of about the English say
21063480	21064760	the bottle of water.
21065920	21067960	I'm like, oh, I don't know what I'm saying.
21068960	21071040	I don't know if I need to slurp this egg
21071040	21073760	because I really can't be bothered getting,
21073760	21074760	where am I supposed to be going?
21074760	21076280	How far away is this location?
21079840	21081920	Oh, it's the castle, right?
21081920	21084560	I'm gonna try, I'm gonna get rid of this.
21084560	21086440	Oh, it says he's a coward though.
21089000	21091280	It's really annoying trying to get cowards
21091280	21093120	because they actually run away.
21095520	21097000	Actually, give me one second.
21097040	21099760	My room is on fire because of this PC.
21100920	21102440	Literally getting baked.
21114200	21115400	Oh, I've been robbed!
21115400	21118520	I've looked away for five seconds and I've been robbed!
21118520	21120720	Oh, right, I didn't need the money that much.
21121800	21122680	It's fine, it's fine, great.
21122680	21123640	Let me put my headset on.
21123640	21126000	That actually can't hear the gear right now.
21126000	21128480	Did he just run up to me and like rob me?
21138040	21139800	Not seeing my room's hope,
21139800	21141440	but too hope it's just came in through a ring
21141440	21144680	and honestly, I'm sweltering.
21144680	21146800	I don't know if that's the Scottish word, sweltering.
21146800	21147640	Do you see that?
21147640	21148480	I'm sweltering.
21149960	21151320	Sweating my beets off.
21152200	21156160	Although I feel like sweating my beets off
21156160	21159640	probably comes from like, is it Mardi Gras?
21159640	21161720	Like that party that Americans have
21161720	21166720	where you unveil yourself and you get beets as a reward.
21167440	21169840	Like I think that's where that saying might've came from
21169840	21170680	because that just makes sense.
21170680	21172000	Like, oh, I'm sweating my beets off
21172000	21176360	because I'm like showing the goods so much and so often.
21177360	21182360	Right, where on earth has this got this captain?
21184360	21185840	I really don't want to mess it up
21185840	21189600	because if you mess it up and he runs away in time,
21189600	21193520	you have to wait until the following day.
21193520	21196160	Oh, I think I know who this one is.
21196160	21199360	I think he, oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
21199360	21202840	No, see, oh, you know the guy that can see you right now?
21202840	21206720	I could actually, wait, I can't lock onto him,
21206720	21207880	but he can lock onto me.
21207880	21210320	See you stinky AI, perish.
21213200	21215240	Oh, beets of sweat that come off your head.
21215240	21218240	Ooh, you know what?
21219640	21221760	Yeah, I know that you said that, that makes more sense.
21221760	21225760	Yeah, probably not Mardi Gras really is.
21225760	21228280	Okay, I'll pay it, I'm safe.
21228280	21231240	Where's, yes, I knew it was this one.
21233720	21237200	Do we assassinate him from above, is my question?
21238200	21239560	I don't know.
21241000	21243800	I normally have three signals at this point,
21243800	21246000	which means I can do a raining down effect.
21247000	21249440	Did he really say where did I go?
21249440	21250280	Gryff.
21251320	21254200	Right, if I can air assassinate him,
21254200	21256880	this isn't a problem.
21256880	21259480	If I can lock onto him, I am very tall
21259480	21261160	up to lock onto him though.
21263840	21267520	No, wait, no, wait, lock onto him.
21267520	21269600	Yeah, uh-huh.
21271160	21276160	No, yes, yes, yes, oh, that was so good.
21278960	21282000	Oh, and none of the guards want to defend, that's hilarious.
21283400	21288240	All the guards are like, that man just came out of the sky.
21288240	21291400	We are not, we are retreating right now.
21293680	21296720	Does your room have poor ventilation?
21296720	21298280	That's horrendous ventilation.
21301000	21302840	Unfortunately, I'm renting,
21304280	21307120	so I have like absolutely no input
21307120	21309760	or like anything I could really do about it.
21309760	21311200	Rip in pepperoni.
21315720	21318280	He craves the drop, true.
21318280	21320560	Okay, I shouldn't get too distracted
21320560	21322520	because my tea's gonna get too cold
21322520	21325240	and my fruit juice is gonna get too warm.
21326640	21329880	I am going to ignite the,
21329880	21333520	gotta light this place up and then we're gone, oh.
21337720	21340800	You're edging me and not the good kind.
21344360	21345480	Are the windows open?
21345480	21347760	No, the window's freaking broken.
21347920	21352760	Um, like the landlord is being really nice to me
21352760	21354320	and he's like left me alone.
21354320	21356080	It's not like one of them annoying landlords
21356080	21358960	that are like trying to like trail through your place
21358960	21363960	all the time, but obviously whenever you visit somewhere
21364000	21367240	to rent and you like inspect it,
21367240	21369680	you don't actually know what's wrong with the place
21369680	21373520	until you move in and like they're obviously,
21373520	21377080	I discovered like windows are broken,
21377080	21380920	the hot and like cold, I don't know what the word is,
21382120	21383840	is not like ideal.
21383840	21385720	Are you guys okay if I hide in this hay bale?
21385720	21389720	We'll start drink my, oh, I forgot to shake my fruit juice.
21389720	21392400	Whoops, that's like real one of having fruit juice.
21392400	21394800	Um, I might just drink it real quick.
21394800	21395720	I apologize.
21403840	21405320	Oh, that shit's so good.
21406480	21408520	Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
21408520	21412320	It's apple, banana, lychee, mango, just smoothie.
21412320	21414640	So I'm getting all my fruit in one drink
21414640	21419080	because I don't really eat fruit that often.
21419080	21421160	I like waste fruit, so I feel bad.
21422080	21424120	Oh my God, it's mimosa, mimosa spotted.
21424120	21424960	Uh-huh.
21432880	21434800	Guys, you'll never guess who I arranged
21434800	21436720	an ASMR collab with this morning.
21437800	21439520	They've just showed up in chat.
21444800	21446880	It's very likely.
21446880	21450120	That'll be my first official collab with a VTuber.
21451640	21453560	Got Dimp on the list.
21453560	21455800	I'm hunting down everyone with radios.
21455800	21458720	I'm serious about that goal.
21458720	21461200	I'm arranging them all, we'll make it nice and easy.
21461200	21464320	Gonna be doing my best, so hopefully you guys eat good
21464320	21468720	and you can sleep to my soothing Scottish accent.
21468720	21470720	That's right, wee laddie.
21470720	21472920	Time to go to sleep.
21472920	21474480	Are you tingling?
21474480	21476440	Tingle, tingle, tingle.
21480600	21482720	Oh my God, she must be so cool to be able to collab with you.
21482960	21483800	Ha ha ha ha.
21486440	21489640	I should actually do like four Scots accent
21489640	21491440	on an ASMR, that would be hilarious.
21494240	21496680	I've almost finished my Juicy Just hypotenuse.
21499800	21500800	What should I eat first?
21500800	21501640	Should I eat an egg?
21501640	21502480	I think so.
21504360	21507880	I don't really like the idea of eggs sitting out too long.
21507880	21510040	Oh, what the fuck?
21510120	21512840	To say something was delicious in Scots,
21512840	21515760	you say it was braw, and that was braw.
21515760	21517520	That drink was delicious.
21520320	21522600	You keep mocking your accent.
21522600	21525320	Oh, I don't think people find the Scottish accent hot.
21525320	21527200	I would say like hot accents,
21527200	21530360	like unironically like French Italian
21530360	21532360	or normally like rated quite highly.
21533600	21535360	I have taken a bite of a meat stick.
21535360	21538480	I apologize for anyone who doesn't like eating.
21538480	21539320	I need to eat.
21542560	21546200	I want you to read Go The Eft Sleep and Your Accent.
21546200	21547040	That'd be good.
21550600	21553280	Is Valley Girl strongy real?
21553280	21554120	Hi, guys.
21556320	21559560	I'm so totally excited to be here.
21560760	21564680	Yeah, I'm Valley Girl, I laugh at everything.
21566120	21567720	Yeah, that's the best you can.
21568720	21569560	Yeah, you like that?
21569560	21570880	Is that what you want?
21571920	21572760	I'm scared.
21574840	21576440	I want to perish.
21577360	21579440	Valley Girl's strongy, say in it, brav.
21580480	21582520	Can you do a Scottish Valley Girl?
21586120	21588000	No, I don't think so.
21590800	21593360	No, I don't think so.
21593360	21594600	I didn't think so.
21594600	21598400	No, my brain is like unable to compute what I need to do
21598400	21602440	in order to keep the accent, but make it different.
21603560	21604400	Brain kind of it.
21606440	21609840	You're not hypnotizing us Scottish accents at all.
21611960	21613080	I'm eating the meat.
21613080	21615000	I am now baiting the egg.
21615000	21616080	I'm just going to touch it.
21620800	21622520	I just said fucking delicious.
21624560	21627120	I have erned, oh my God.
21627120	21629200	A bite of the egg and the meat at the same time.
21629200	21630400	I have earned this, okay?
21630400	21631320	I have earned this.
21631320	21632160	Ah.
21638560	21639960	Is I almost choking on it?
21639960	21642160	Hey, ho, there's a first time for everything.
21645240	21647520	It's like a pepper ramy if you're a British.
21647520	21649840	I don't know what the equivalent is in America
21649840	21652760	or it's a twizy stick in Australia.
21654040	21656160	Xio is literally, he's like, I need to rest.
21656200	21657480	I'll be not at this for hours.
21657480	21659480	He's sleeping in the hay.
21665800	21668560	Oh, my mouth opens when my mouth.
21671320	21673160	Ah, that's cool.
21677000	21679040	Like my mouth is closed right now,
21679040	21684040	but because my mouth opens, well, yeah.
21684880	21686200	Ba, ba, ba, ba.
21686200	21687040	Sorry, sorry.
21690160	21692360	A slim gym, probably.
21701640	21706640	Would you like some sweet chili pea snack
21707880	21709120	that's been baked?
21714120	21714960	Ow.
21726280	21727440	Okay, open up.
21733640	21735680	I hope you guys stretched.
21737440	21738680	Because if you haven't stretched,
21738680	21741800	that's you sat for six hours and you're supposed to stretch.
21742800	21744120	If anyone's in a wheelchair,
21744120	21746080	you're exempt from these instructions.
21757080	21759800	I stretched all my limbs, this is good.
21762480	21764200	You're not going to fall for that one stare.
21764200	21766480	Well, you're going to split, aren't you?
21766480	21767800	Ah, stare.
21768640	21773240	Oh, my God, I don't know if I can read that out.
21775560	21777240	When is booty inspection day?
21781440	21784720	A faint sound of munching emanates from the car.
21784720	21785720	Hum, hum, hum, hum.
21788160	21793160	I've got sweet chili pea snacks that are baked.
21794000	21796920	Two meat sticks and two eggs,
21796920	21799000	and I've got one meat and egg left,
21799000	21800760	and I'm just munching on the peas.
21805680	21806840	Oh, my God.
21807880	21811360	So for years, I had no idea what Charlie Horse meant.
21815480	21817600	It's just called a pulled muscle.
21818440	21823440	And I was like, what on earth is a Charlie Horse?
21823440	21826520	Like, is this a famous horse named Charlie?
21826520	21828120	Why is it happening to people?
21828120	21830000	That's not possible.
21830000	21832360	I was like, it's crazy.
21832360	21833640	And then I finally figured it out
21833640	21837680	because I watched a meme and the guy fell over
21837680	21840600	and he was like, ah, ah, Charlie Horse.
21840600	21842440	And because of his body language,
21842440	21844520	my brain was like, oh, my God,
21844520	21846680	he's having a muscle spasm.
21846720	21848280	That's what it means.
21849280	21852360	Like, oh, I need a burp.
21852360	21854520	I'm so sorry, I'm eating, so it means a burp a lot.
21854520	21856600	I'm jammy, if you don't like it.
21860720	21864400	I don't think a zero or a mercy burp.
21864400	21865840	I think they have manners
21865840	21868480	and weren't raised in a barn like me.
21869480	21870480	Mm-mm, mm-mm.
21876040	21878840	I was named after Sir Charles of Horse.
21881840	21883320	Ooh, money.
21883320	21885280	We've got 3,000 in the bank right now.
21887360	21890160	Some say that Charlie's still in pain to this day.
21891080	21892400	Was that a meme on Family Guy?
21892400	21893800	I don't know what it was.
21893800	21896720	No, those ones are the difference.
21896720	21898080	I learned from Mercy the other day
21898080	21899680	that saying be there, be square
21899680	21901160	is because you won't be around.
21903120	21903960	Wait, what?
21905000	21909200	Be there or be square is because you won't be around.
21910880	21915680	Oh, that's so smart.
21915680	21920560	Like, around in a circle, yeah?
21920560	21922640	And like, you won't be around in the area
21922640	21925000	if you're not there, because you're a square.
21926040	21927960	Yeah, oh, I just got that too.
21927960	21929560	That's good, I like that.
21929560	21931320	Mercy smart.
21931320	21933440	Shawnee, it's not manners, it's your cuttlebone.
21933440	21934960	You're just in to boil and say,
21934960	21936920	yes, this is my first time on land.
21937760	21938800	Sometimes.
21940760	21941760	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
21947440	21949240	Careful, you don't want to make me too smart.
21949240	21951760	I'll start coming up when you names Fond de la Buse...
21952720	21954640	I'm never gonna live down Fond de la Buse
21954640	21955480	when we sucky.
21958720	21961880	What marshmallow did you want to see Anthony spit at that?
21961880	21963080	Oh, I didn't open up the marshmallows.
21963080	21964840	Well, we do it at the end of stream,
21964840	21966000	because we're actually really close
21966000	21968040	to finishing the game, like, really close.
21970160	21971000	Mm-hmm.
21974200	21975040	Mm-hmm.
21976960	21979480	Alright, you better be scared of me cooking again.
21984120	21985120	Yum-yum-yum-yum.
21987960	21988800	Mm-hmm.
21996960	21997800	Mm-hmm.
21999840	22002920	Uh, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna suck my fingers.
22002920	22004120	I know some people don't like it,
22004120	22006360	matter-wise, but I don't have an napkin.
22006360	22007200	Eh.
22008920	22009760	Eh.
22010800	22012720	That reminds me, I need to make the audio.
22012720	22014040	Eh.
22014040	22014880	Mm-hmm.
22016720	22017560	Mm-hmm.
22018960	22019800	Mm-hmm.
22019800	22020920	Okay.
22020920	22023000	I inhaled the meat and the egg,
22023000	22024080	and then I finished my tea,
22024080	22025080	and then we're gonna get straight back
22025080	22025920	and finish this stuff.
22025920	22026760	Ah.
22029200	22030040	Mm-hmm.
22031960	22033600	Yum-yum-yum.
22033600	22035360	This is a really good combo.
22036480	22039480	I need to, like, more charcuterie snack stuff
22039480	22041480	for longer streams,
22041480	22043840	because I don't have time to actually make food.
22045320	22046160	Mm-hmm.
22048960	22053960	Maybe in a cold pasta dish,
22054000	22055200	I can pre-make.
22056720	22059560	The crunchy thing is the meat stick.
22059560	22061960	It's got, like, a skin on it, eh.
22061960	22064200	I don't know, mm-hmm.
22064200	22065040	That's the meat.
22068080	22068920	Mm-hmm.
22073480	22077560	I've got protein from the egg,
22077560	22080680	and protein from the meat and fats,
22081720	22084320	and the pea snacks are carbohydrates.
22086000	22087000	Ah.
22087000	22087840	Ah.
22092520	22093520	Yum-yum-yum.
22093520	22095240	I'm gonna get tons of hydration.
22097440	22099920	That's way too crunchy to be, it is meat!
22100920	22102760	It is meat, I promise you, it's meat.
22102760	22105320	It's, like, an outer skin, like a pepper ramy.
22107840	22110720	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
22110720	22112480	Okay, all the food is finished.
22112480	22113320	Yippee!
22114520	22116440	I'm now for the tea.
22116440	22117280	Ah.
22119080	22119920	Um.
22121280	22122240	Honestly,
22123960	22125880	depending on how fast we go,
22125880	22129360	we might actually finish the campaign in less than two hours,
22129360	22131120	but I'm quite happy to, like, fart about
22131120	22134440	and do the Borgia Towers after, maybe, like,
22134440	22136000	so we can, like, streamline tomorrow
22136000	22138280	for doing the DNA sequence run.
22141200	22142040	Mm.
22146320	22147880	Ah.
22147880	22149960	I'm gonna let a big burp, I'm sorry.
22151720	22153880	Oh, that was good.
22153880	22155400	That was such good food.
22155400	22157640	I really needed that, and I hit the spot.
22160560	22163240	A battered Mars four-hand count stream.
22163240	22164640	It's a honey tea.
22166000	22166840	I'm sorry.
22166840	22169920	It all comes back up, I've got you.
22169920	22173440	I was gonna record Isomar, like, your girlfriend
22173440	22175160	for, like, forgets to turn off the mic,
22175160	22176880	so it was just me munching and crunching,
22176880	22178800	because some people, like, really enjoy,
22178800	22181080	like, other people's, like, munching sounds.
22181080	22183480	I'm, like, if you are telling me
22183480	22185720	that I can order McDonald's
22187120	22189000	and eat it on the mic,
22189000	22191800	and people would, like, be happy with that,
22191800	22194320	like, uh, you don't gotta tell me twice.
22194520	22195360	Oh.
22196840	22197960	Shawnee, if you're looking for a snack
22197960	22200560	that's easy to prepare, grapes.
22200560	22201880	I can't believe it.
22201880	22205800	I can't believe you're telling me to eat healthy
22205800	22207880	and look after myself.
22207880	22208720	Oh.
22210400	22212000	Cruel world.
22212000	22213960	Honey tea, you boil those per beat?
22213960	22215800	No!
22215800	22217360	I love the bees.
22217360	22220880	I get to, um, buy my honey from, like,
22221880	22223320	a, like, smaller shop,
22223320	22226680	and I like supporting them on their own, like.
22226680	22227840	Right, I sip my tea.
22229680	22231560	Oh, yeah, I can't, that was roasting.
22231560	22233560	It's still quite warm, not gonna lie.
22233560	22235040	I thought it was gonna cool.
22235040	22236040	Be a bit cooler.
22236040	22236880	Uh.
22239320	22240920	I'm okay, I'm okay, though.
22240920	22244480	Right, we're gonna go and get our wand taken off of us.
22246880	22249120	Right, we'll put that on the Herald.
22249120	22250720	Thank you very much.
22251720	22252560	Yuck.
22253680	22256080	You're about to stand in some serious meta.
22258480	22259800	Chicken nuggets ASMR.
22259800	22260640	Ooh.
22262960	22266280	Is 100, does eating 100 chicken nuggets still a challenge?
22267720	22269760	I feel like you starve me
22269760	22272920	and I could probably do that, like, in one go.
22276440	22278480	Have I bought this bank over here?
22278480	22280160	I haven't!
22280160	22282240	Investments, people, investments.
22284400	22285720	That reminds me several years ago,
22285720	22288960	back when Tumblr was an important platform
22288960	22290760	that some vegans actually thought bees
22290760	22293000	were physical harm for their honey.
22293000	22293840	Oh.
22293840	22294680	I mean.
22296320	22299520	Um, vegans just doing their thing, it's fine.
22299520	22301920	They're nice, I guess.
22303320	22305120	I just, yeah.
22305120	22305960	Vegans are vegans.
22306680	22309840	I completely understand, like, the stance,
22309840	22312000	like, no one actually wants any animals
22312000	22314080	to be hurt or all that jazz.
22314080	22317720	I just, you know, I ask,
22317720	22319840	have you ever seen a healthy-looking vegan
22319840	22322600	when they're like, I've been vegan for five years?
22322600	22324120	They look ill.
22324120	22325880	I had a close family member
22325880	22330120	that was temporarily vegan for a couple of years.
22330120	22334520	And when they finally started to eat, meet again,
22334600	22336560	they were, like, healthy overnight.
22336560	22337640	I'm so sorry.
22337640	22339200	I apologize if anyone is a vegan here,
22339200	22341760	but please seriously take your supplements,
22341760	22343000	look at what you need to,
22343000	22344240	in order to get what you need,
22344240	22346960	because please, please be careful.
22346960	22348120	It's very dangerous.
22348120	22351080	I don't, I'm actually being serious for, like,
22351080	22353080	for one millisecond.
22353080	22354400	It is incredibly dangerous
22354400	22356640	to genuinely choose to be a vegan.
22356640	22360360	And a lot of people don't realize, until it's too late,
22360360	22362600	that, like, you are,
22365360	22368720	like, if you really want to get into it,
22368720	22370840	like, there's the caveman times
22370840	22372640	before we discovered what cooking,
22372640	22374720	what cooked meat could do for us.
22374720	22376720	And, like, it's like, you know,
22376720	22380000	once humans had access to cooked meat,
22380000	22382520	the brain power of humans, like, went up.
22382520	22384360	I can't remember what all the details
22384360	22385640	and what it's called and all that,
22385640	22387400	but, like, this is what I've been taught,
22387400	22388840	and, like, I genuinely believe it.
22388840	22390640	I'm sorry, but if you've ever looked at vegan,
22390640	22392720	they just look like a husk of a human.
22392720	22395520	And I'm so sorry if it's offensively.
22395520	22397600	It's just my opinion, but I never said I was smart.
22397600	22399320	And my opinions don't reflect the agency.
22399320	22401080	I'm sorry, love you, bye.
22401080	22402840	I'll stop talking.
22402840	22403800	I'll stop talking.
22403800	22406240	Okay, this, uh, Borgia district,
22406240	22408360	you have to scale it from the rooftops.
22408360	22409680	It is impossible.
22409680	22411920	You have to do it via AroStorm.
22413320	22415360	If you do not do it via AroStorm,
22415360	22417520	you're just, like, hurting yourself.
22417520	22418740	Like, it is so bad.
22420080	22422320	And you can get a flag on the way, so.
22423160	22426040	So, literally, drop down AroStorm instantly.
22427160	22428320	And just let that done.
22429400	22430480	Easiest.
22430480	22432560	Literally, you don't even annoy any other guards
22432560	22433600	that are in the vicinity.
22433600	22436120	There is no one on the rooftops.
22436120	22438560	As long as you have AroStorm unlocked,
22438560	22441120	which is what the, um,
22442400	22444000	which is what the three recruits,
22444000	22446400	so you need six previous Borgia towers destroyed
22446400	22448880	in order to get that, but once you've got it,
22448880	22452000	then you're smooth sailing through the game.
22453640	22455880	If only Leafs had protein.
22455880	22460640	Yes, I know deeper green-colored veg tablels
22460640	22463480	are, like, really, really good in general.
22463480	22465040	What way am I to go?
22465040	22466920	That looks too big for me to...
22466920	22468320	Yeah, I don't have a glove yet.
22468320	22470520	Okay, this looks like the way I need to go.
22471320	22473480	Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
22475040	22478360	Did anyone get their, what was it?
22478360	22479800	What's that organ that blows up
22479800	22481720	that was used for grass eating?
22481760	22483040	Like, it literally kills you.
22483040	22484920	I'll always forget the name of it.
22484920	22486000	An appendix?
22486000	22488360	Did anyone get their appendixes removed?
22489600	22491080	Ooh.
22491080	22493880	Did you get wrecked with your appendix?
22495840	22497080	Okay, tea time.
22499600	22501560	Rice and beans.
22501560	22502840	Can cover you for the most.
22502840	22503680	Yeah.
22507440	22509400	Yours burst?
22510320	22513720	Oh, you must have been deathly ill.
22513720	22516720	If it bursts, it can result in death,
22516720	22519360	because it's just straight poison to your organs.
22519360	22520640	Holy crap.
22520640	22522880	Someone said my tonsils grew y-
22522880	22525120	They stole your tonsils?
22525120	22526640	Oh, give them back.
22529880	22531760	I thought appendixes were forbill-
22531760	22532600	I thought append-
22532600	22535200	I got some appendixes was for when we used to eat,
22535200	22538320	like, grass, grass, like, back in the old day.
22538360	22539520	I'm taking a sip of tea.
22539520	22541640	I'm gonna try and finish up my apology.
22544640	22545800	Ah, your gallbladder?
22545800	22546640	I'm scared.
22546640	22548520	My mom had a gallbladder issue.
22548520	22550040	And so did my gran.
22550040	22553040	Genetically, I am predispositioned.
22553040	22554320	Like, one day on stream,
22554320	22556920	I'm just gonna start like screaming and being like,
22556920	22559520	gallbladder, gallbladder!
22560480	22563720	But, uh, hopefully that doesn't actually happen.
22563720	22566200	But I can't say I'm the healthiest being around.
22568920	22570160	You can die of death.
22570160	22572080	Did I say that?
22572080	22573080	You can die of death.
22578040	22579600	I don't wish that pain.
22579600	22582160	Wait, you know how you guys are guys?
22583160	22587040	Have you guys ever passed the kidney stone?
22588800	22590640	For anyone who drinks an energy drink,
22590640	22591880	have you passed the kidney stone?
22591880	22593000	Yes or no?
22593000	22594320	I'm very interested in that.
22594320	22595160	I wanna know.
22596000	22597280	Never, maybe?
22597280	22599760	Did you ever really sort of pee-pee at one time?
22599760	22602160	We are not 100% what it is used for.
22602160	22604240	These range from filtration,
22604240	22607640	to breaking down fiber, to appendix, to a mystery organ.
22607640	22608880	That's so cool!
22608880	22610040	Like, how do we not know?
22610040	22611680	We've got so much history.
22611680	22612520	No.
22615080	22615920	I hope I don't.
22615920	22616760	Yeah, it sucks.
22616760	22617600	Ooh!
22620400	22623080	I've heard stories from Whammon.
22623440	22625200	I've heard stories from Whammon
22625200	22626760	that are like, I've had a kidney stone
22626760	22627640	and I've had a baby.
22627640	22629800	I'd rather, you know, do the baby again.
22629800	22631880	And I'm like, hey, see?
22631880	22634440	That's biology in play.
22634440	22639440	Did you know the brain actually tells Whammon
22639440	22642120	that they're birth of their...
22642120	22644280	Wait, where the heck am I going?
22644280	22646560	Can I climb up here without the glove?
22646560	22649400	I don't think I can climb up here without the glove.
22649400	22650240	Climb?
22650240	22651240	No?
22651240	22652160	Okay, I can, I can.
22652200	22653040	Jesus.
22653040	22655720	I was like, oh, I've just missed out.
22655720	22657520	I love stronticolors and I heard,
22657520	22659040	heart kidney stone perils!
22659040	22660560	Oh my God!
22660560	22661680	I do have peril.
22661680	22664240	I have a peril in a very special location.
22665760	22667040	Are you there, Mercy?
22667040	22668680	Are you streaming later?
22668680	22672040	Are you streaming in one hour, two hour?
22672960	22675680	Three hour, Mercy stream, question mark.
22678400	22680400	I'm finishing my team, please pardon me.
22683160	22685160	I need a burp, it's like stuck in my throat.
22690160	22692160	I have finished my team.
22694160	22695160	Requiem.
22696160	22698160	Requiem, cadavante.
22698160	22700160	Okay, whee!
22708160	22709160	It's Azura.
22710160	22712160	Is Azura?
22712160	22714160	Is Mama Azu streaming in the day?
22714160	22716160	Wait, where the heck am I today?
22717160	22718160	Sounds like I need to go up here.
22718160	22721160	Oh, that's because I do need to go up here.
22724160	22727160	Only energy drink I've had is Calcius.
22727160	22728160	Calesus?
22728160	22729160	What?
22729160	22731160	C-E-L.
22731160	22732160	Celsius.
22732160	22733160	Celsius.
22733160	22734160	Oh.
22734160	22736160	I got there in the end.
22736160	22738160	I got there in the end.
22739160	22741160	You just gotta let me cook on some words, okay?
22741160	22743160	Some words are like, huh?
22743160	22744160	Huh?
22745160	22747160	And then you just gotta have full,
22747160	22749160	netically spell them out.
22749160	22751160	Everyone is streaming right now.
22751160	22753160	Oh my god, overlapping corp, I can't believe it.
22755160	22758160	I literally tell everyone like, go watch everyone else stream
22758160	22760160	because I'm literally just sitting doing like an
22760160	22762160	endurance eight hour stream type thing.
22762160	22764160	I'm just having a blast.
22764160	22765160	Yeah.
22765160	22767160	But don't worry when you go live in Mercy,
22767160	22770160	I always recommend to the girls, please, to go.
22770160	22773160	No, I always recommend to the brief links
22773160	22777160	to give you a chance and check you out.
22777160	22781160	See, we work because odds are I'm still going to be streaming
22781160	22782160	by the time you...
22782160	22785160	Oh, I wasn't supposed to be discovered.
22786160	22788160	Oh well, so we over...
22788160	22789160	It's fine.
22789160	22790160	We're doing it to...
22790160	22791160	Look at that.
22791160	22792160	Look at that.
22792160	22793160	Combat cam.
22793160	22794160	Combat cam.
22795160	22796160	Ooh.
22796160	22798160	Is that Azura live right now with that link?
22798160	22799160	Or is that Imi?
22799160	22801160	Or is that just everyone's link altogether?
22801160	22803160	Silence discord mode.
22803160	22804160	Oh, you're not discord mode at all.
22804160	22805160	YouTube mode.
22805160	22806160	I'm just kidding.
22806160	22807160	Thank you for moderating for free.
22807160	22808160	I really appreciate it.
22808160	22811160	Actually, all the girls really do appreciate it because
22812160	22814160	it's kind of like one of those like jobs,
22814160	22817160	you know, like the silent, unrecognized work,
22817160	22819160	but I actually genuinely like thank you to everyone
22819160	22821160	who like applied to be a mod,
22821160	22823160	and like thank you for everyone just being like
22823160	22825160	cool at the mods and all that shiz.
22827160	22828160	Really appreciate that.
22828160	22831160	But then again, silence, YouTube mode.
22832160	22834160	With all that said, and all due respect.
22836160	22838160	Oh, I'm just getting spotted by everyone.
22838160	22839160	Reisa, we're just in a big fight.
22841160	22842160	Oh no, they have guns.
22844160	22845160	Calling their assassins.
22845160	22846160	Calling their assassins.
22848160	22849160	Okay, I'm not dealing with them all.
22849160	22850160	You can kill them all.
22851160	22852160	I'm not dealing with them.
22853160	22854160	Whoa, they literally...
22856160	22858160	Is he gonna see me entering the castle?
22858160	22859160	I think I may.
22859160	22860160	I simply have all...
22861160	22863160	You tell the girls to watch the girls.
22863160	22864160	No, I said it wrong.
22864160	22865160	I said it wrong.
22865160	22866160	They do it for free.
22866160	22867160	I mean, literally.
22868160	22870160	Azura and Emmy are...
22870160	22871160	Azura is online as well.
22871160	22875160	Oh, if there are any Azura Dulay,
22875160	22877160	she is officially online as well.
22877160	22879160	If you're an Azura Dulay, watch her.
22879160	22881160	I ordered a fresh batch of la Catorre la last night.
22881160	22883160	Oh, so no one has tasted my Catorre.
22884160	22885160	But the Pope has taken it all.
22885160	22886160	Where is the Pope?
22886160	22887160	He meets with Cesare.
22888160	22889160	Strange.
22889160	22890160	He did not tell me.
22890160	22891160	Cesare had returned.
22891160	22892160	Imagine being a Mortarader.
22893160	22894160	Imagine...
22895160	22896160	Okay.
22896160	22897160	Now what?
22898160	22900160	Sorry, I'm starting to lose that little bit.
22900160	22902160	I was like, imagine being a Mortarader.
22902160	22903160	Okay, now what happens?
22904160	22905160	Danny, did anything else?
22906160	22907160	I'm imagining.
22907160	22909160	With my mind only, I'm imagining.
22912160	22914160	Okay, I'm getting a bit delirious.
22914160	22915160	I think it's like...
22916160	22918160	Bro, I know I said this yesterday.
22918160	22920160	We were so delirious during that group collab.
22920160	22924160	But I'm so excited for our official group game collab together.
22924160	22926160	I hope you guys like the intro.
22926160	22929160	I'm going to script it when we start up the streams.
22931160	22934160	And literally, everyone's going to be streaming it.
22935160	22938160	So you can see all six POVs at once.
22942160	22943160	Oh, I'm burping away.
22945160	22947160	You've been at this for six hours.
22948160	22949160	Honestly.
22953160	22955160	You, come here so I can assassinate you.
22956160	22957160	That's right.
22957160	22958160	Come closer.
22958160	22959160	I can sense thine penis.
22960160	22961160	Okay, sorry.
22961160	22962160	I shouldn't have said that.
22962160	22963160	I like that.
22965160	22967160	I think I'm actually doing the same thing a little bit.
22968160	22969160	But hey, hope.
22969160	22970160	It's not just life.
22971160	22972160	Let's go.
22974160	22976160	Oh, I don't know why I said that.
22976160	22978160	I'm remembering just like, hee hee.
22978160	22979160	Oh, I'm notorious.
22980160	22982160	I didn't lure my notoriety.
22984160	22985160	Oh, it sucks.
22986160	22987160	I almost got caught.
22987160	22989160	Well, actually, it doesn't really matter if I get caught by him.
22989160	22990160	He doesn't come.
22993160	22995160	How do you not see me?
22995160	22996160	I'm literally on a bookcase.
22996160	22997160	I'm doing the ballard.
22998160	22999160	Okay.
23002160	23004160	God, he's so armored out the world.
23006160	23008160	I have something on my mind.
23008160	23012160	Look, all I'm saying is that the marshmallows have been having a good time on marshmallows.
23014160	23015160	Oh, whips.
23015160	23016160	I wasn't supposed to jump down.
23016160	23017160	Hail.
23017160	23018160	Whoopsie.
23018160	23023160	Oh, I'm getting in trouble.
23023160	23027160	I don't remember all these enemies being here.
23027160	23030160	I'm going to have to remember when I'm doing the, like, do not be detected.
23030160	23034160	Like, you put that away.
23034160	23036160	Literally diddle-dee-dee.
23036160	23038160	And I shall first get wrecked.
23039160	23042160	This town ain't big enough for the both of us.
23042160	23043160	Cowboy.
23043160	23044160	Oh, that's 6,000.
23045160	23047160	We're getting so near the end of the game.
23049160	23050160	What has happened here?
23050160	23051160	I do not know what you mean.
23051160	23052160	I want to take.
23052160	23053160	I take.
23055160	23057160	If I want you to die.
23057160	23058160	You.
23058160	23059160	Even those with an army.
23059160	23061160	You intend to give me money?
23062160	23064160	No, I do not.
23064160	23067160	Then I will use the piece of Eden to get what I want.
23067160	23069160	Your help is not necessary.
23071160	23073160	That has been made abundantly to me.
23075160	23076160	That says dad.
23076160	23080160	Are you aware that the Baron de Valois is dead?
23080160	23081160	No.
23081160	23082160	Did you?
23082160	23084160	What reason could I possibly have to kill him?
23085160	23090160	Was he plotting against me with my brilliant, treacherous captain general?
23090160	23092160	I do not have to stand for this.
23093160	23095160	The assassins murdered him.
23095160	23097160	Why did you not stop them?
23097160	23099160	As if I could.
23099160	23102160	It was not my decision to attack Monteriggione.
23102160	23103160	It was yours.
23104160	23105160	Shh.
23106160	23109160	It is high time you took responsibilities for your actions.
23109160	23111160	My accomplishments.
23111160	23115160	Despite the constant interference of failures like you.
23117160	23119160	You are not going anywhere.
23120160	23121160	I have the piece.
23121160	23122160	Out of my way, old man.
23124160	23126160	Get out of my way, old man.
23128160	23131160	I gave you everything and yet it's never enough.
23131160	23134160	Cesare, he intends to poison you.
23140160	23142160	You have not listened to reason.
23143160	23146160	Father, do you not see?
23147160	23150160	I can control all of this.
23152160	23155160	If I want to live, I live.
23155160	23159160	If I want to take, I take.
23161160	23166160	And if I want you to die, you die.
23167160	23169160	It's so good.
23169160	23172160	Where is the piece of Eden?
23172160	23174160	I know where it is.
23174160	23177160	And you did not tell me he had taken it.
23177160	23180160	Cesare, it's me, your queen.
23182160	23183160	You are my sister.
23183160	23184160	None more.
23186160	23187160	Where is it?
23187160	23188160	You never loved me?
23188160	23190160	You never loved me?
23190160	23192160	Where is the apple?
23192160	23193160	Tell me.
23198160	23200160	The voice acting is so good.
23200160	23202160	Tell me.
23203160	23204160	Tell me.
23207160	23209160	It's just so good.
23209160	23212160	It's just so good.
23212160	23215160	Thank you for letting me share this game with you.
23215160	23217160	Fun fact, you don't need to hurt anyone.
23217160	23219160	Oh, no, no, go over, Etsy.
23221160	23222160	Etsy.
23222160	23224160	Oh, you're giving me a heart attack.
23224160	23225160	Etsy.
23225160	23227160	Oh, Etsy.
23227160	23229160	Oh, you're giving me a heart attack.
23229160	23230160	Little sister.
23230160	23231160	I know.
23231160	23232160	I know.
23232160	23234160	Fucking hell, I was having a heart attack.
23234160	23235160	Do you see that?
23235160	23236160	They're related?
23236160	23238160	Yeah, it's based on history.
23240160	23241160	I could see.
23243160	23245160	No, where that bastard is going.
23245160	23246160	San Pietro.
23247160	23249160	The pavilion in the courtyard.
23249160	23251160	The pavilion in the courtyard.
23251160	23252160	Hmm.
23257160	23259160	Exit through the front gate.
23259160	23261160	Wait, am I still going to get attacked by guards?
23261160	23262160	Oh, oh, wrong way.
23262160	23263160	Etsy.
23263160	23266160	You've just got such a big palace.
23268160	23270160	I'll come back for you later.
23271160	23272160	See you later.
23272160	23274160	I'll come for you later.
23274160	23275160	See you later.
23275160	23276160	Like this.
23279160	23280160	Assassino.
23284160	23286160	I will come for you.
23286160	23287160	Wait.
23287160	23288160	Later.
23289160	23291160	I'll come for you later.
23295160	23296160	I just like doing that.
23299160	23300160	Reefling.
23300160	23301160	Reefling.
23301160	23303160	I'll come back for you later.
23303160	23304160	Later.
23304160	23306160	I'll come back for you later.
23306160	23307160	Yes, I will.
23307160	23309160	Who's a good Reefling?
23309160	23311160	Have you been a good boy?
23311160	23313160	Is it time for your daily milky-wilky?
23317160	23318160	Oopsies.
23318160	23319160	Oopsies.
23319160	23320160	Oopsies.
23320160	23321160	Wait, he was in my way.
23321160	23323160	Am I supposed to just ignore him?
23323160	23324160	I think I am.
23324160	23326160	I will remember that for when we redo the mission.
23328160	23329160	Spiral scare.
23329160	23330160	Right.
23330160	23335160	So that you can grab this box because the timer don't start until now.
23335160	23340160	You have to leg it for this entire next section.
23340160	23341160	Okay?
23341160	23343160	You have to do it for the entire next day.
23343160	23347160	Fucking let's go.
23347160	23348160	Well, you're stuck in the cutscene.
23348160	23349160	Give it a second.
23349160	23350160	Let it cook.
23350160	23351160	Let it cook.
23351160	23352160	Let's go.
23352160	23353160	Don't worry.
23353160	23354160	Leave a faith.
23354160	23355160	Leave a faith.
23355160	23356160	Don't worry.
23356160	23357160	Don't worry.
23357160	23358160	Leave a faith.
23358160	23359160	Promise.
23359160	23360160	Promise.
23360160	23361160	Ta-da.
23361160	23362160	See?
23362160	23363160	It's right there.
23363160	23369160	And then if you go in the street of the pavilion, it's the easiest way to navigate to the place.
23369160	23370160	Okay?
23370160	23372160	And then you need to do the jump thing.
23372160	23373160	Jump.
23373160	23376160	And then just take the main street all the way up to the pavilion.
23376160	23380160	And just jump every time you see an agility at the bottom of your screen.
23380160	23381160	You just jump.
23381160	23382160	And they can't get you.
23382160	23383160	Jump.
23383160	23384160	See?
23384160	23386160	The AI unclogs you.
23386160	23387160	Jump.
23387160	23388160	Jump.
23388160	23389160	Jump.
23389160	23394160	And then you'll be perfectly fine.
23394160	23395160	Jump.
23395160	23397160	Now you might have to fight them at the end.
23397160	23403160	I honestly don't understand what the development team actually wanted from you at this point.
23403160	23404160	Please leave me alone.
23404160	23407160	But oh, he almost touched me.
23407160	23408160	He touched my ankle.
23408160	23409160	Oh, he's touching me.
23409160	23411160	He's touching me.
23411160	23412160	Okay.
23412160	23414160	And then they opened up.
23414160	23416160	And then we just go inside.
23416160	23420160	And then sometimes you may have to come outside and fight, but it's okay.
23420160	23422160	It's okay.
23422160	23423160	Okay.
23423160	23424160	So we were...
23424160	23429160	That's a lot of bad guys.
23429160	23430160	No.
23430160	23431160	Okay.
23431160	23432160	We got one.
23432160	23433160	Oh.
23433160	23435160	Oh, I'm getting ganged on.
23435160	23436160	I'm getting ganged up.
23436160	23437160	I don't like it.
23437160	23438160	Take this.
23438160	23439160	And this.
23439160	23440160	And this.
23440160	23441160	And this.
23441160	23442160	And this.
23442160	23443160	And this.
23443160	23444160	And this.
23444160	23445160	And this.
23445160	23446160	Okay.
23446160	23453160	Unfortunately we are in range because of that yellow on the map, but we might be able to
23453160	23454160	stand here.
23454160	23460160	It should time out because they're not supposed to actually see us.
23460160	23461160	There we go.
23461160	23462160	There we go.
23462160	23466160	Now, did you guys remember the pineapple?
23467160	23470160	Did you remember the pineapple?
23470160	23473160	We did a little eagle vision.
23473160	23476160	The pineapple is glowing.
23482160	23484160	I was right there.
23484160	23485160	What?
23485160	23487160	I was there all along.
23487160	23489160	Excuse me?
23489160	23491160	Looking for this.
23491160	23492160	Don't kill us, Sino.
23492160	23500160	My sword will take your life.
23500160	23503160	Hydration.
23503160	23505160	Wow.
23505160	23508160	Those armor clinking sounds.
23508160	23510160	Good sound effect.
23510160	23511160	Guards.
23511160	23512160	Guards.
23512160	23514520	Oh, Chasary.
23514520	23517160	Your time can't last.
23517160	23520560	Not while I come in with the apple.
23520560	23524040	Okay, so basically just run
23525520	23529180	Wait hold on let me let me open the map. Sorry to bring down the energy
23529180	23532280	I need to open the map because I always forget which direction I need to go in
23532500	23537680	So I need to keep going dead ahead and then take a right. Okay. Let's go
23543040	23549600	It is just a waste of time trying to stop and hurt like get rid of all these enemies
23550560	23556760	There's no point. So just outrun them until you get to the water and swim like your life depends on it
23556760	23558760	They keep they jump in me
23559760	23561760	Get off
23561760	23563600	Get off
23563600	23565600	Away naughty
23566400	23571760	No, if you follow this street, I think it takes you to the water. Oh
23573360	23577180	I don't like those brute guys. They're actually pretty strong. Oh
23578180	23580180	Oh
23585780	23593940	When the moon hits your high like a big piece of pie that's a morning
23597820	23600920	Bills will ring ring a ding a ding
23601920	23603920	Pizza
23605600	23607600	And that's how you get away from that sequence
23608560	23615320	Jump on that boat and get out of there. You do not have to attack anyone. You do not have to eliminate any enemies
23615840	23618600	Jump in that boat and you are safe
23622880	23624880	Oh
23630920	23634480	To assemble his remaining support coming weeks
23636000	23638000	When the moon hits your eye, that's a strongy
23644680	23651560	It's blinding odd my models not reactive to what happens on screen and he put that back on I love that
23651680	23653680	That was like the funniest thing
23656480	23658480	My eyes
23659480	23663600	We do have no a right a sight to see us down
23668920	23670920	Flashbang
23672560	23677880	I think for the loser guards and touch the pineapple without hurting anyone just pop a smoke bomb and getting a crowded bench
23677880	23683480	I wonder that may be the solution. They are everywhere and nowhere at once
23683480	23685480	I
23686680	23690440	We cannot on our own senior you must help us. I am
23692600	23694600	Idiot
23695600	23699400	And then you will see how quickly the assassini fall
23702080	23704080	Delude yourself Chesere
23704600	23706600	Oh
23710800	23713240	Right so the apple is a bit funny
23713240	23720080	Do you see that white one that white line means imminent death the yellow means under my control
23721400	23722960	and
23722960	23726040	So we want to basically the apple will take your health
23726040	23728040	so I have to wait until it restores and
23728600	23734800	Then wait and then it kills the people who we want to kill and then the others are either under my control
23734800	23738560	Or we'll fight for me. It's a bit finicky, but once you learn it you get it
23742000	23745360	We're teleporting all over the map. We're at the blooming
23746640	23748440	Rose
23748440	23750440	Yes
23752720	23754720	Under stress
23754960	23760760	Any anyone else under stress and we're feeling about a key need not a bit of a
23762600	23764600	I'm not gonna say it's too easy too easy
23769480	23774400	So the point of Assassin's Creed is to get rid of the apples of Eden, however
23775800	23777800	It's always a good good boy and
23778480	23780120	his
23780120	23783200	DNA communes with the apple so his bloodline
23783800	23785800	Kind of has been chosen
23786520	23792160	I'm pretty sure the guys around this corner actually and I've gone too far. Yeah, there is and
23794840	23796840	Feel the cardinal
23797400	23800200	He I think he just runs down this hill and then that's it
23800400	23805640	You do not have access to your recruits at this time, but you don't need it because you literally have the apple Eden
23805640	23811680	I will say one thing the more. Oh, no, actually it doesn't affect with the more armor you have
23812680	23818400	Also on the weapon wheel, you can't select anything when you hold the apple of Eden, but I won't even let you take it out
23825840	23828400	So we just need to follow him into the coliseum
23830320	23838080	Okay, no, no, I'm not here. Uh-uh. No, uh-uh. You didn't see me. No. Oh, you're actually a liar
23838680	23843320	And and I will you you guards just spawned in
23844120	23846320	Don't lie. You just spawned in rain in front of me
23847600	23849600	as a see
23851640	23853640	And a cup
23854840	23858560	You won't find me because I'm not what you need
23859480	23861000	I'm
23861000	23863840	Your end maker caretaker
23864480	23878000	My bikini ever has to be mentioned enough. It wasn't I've unbended everything so there's no chance of accident or bikini show
23878000	23880000	I apologize
23880240	23882240	Borja money has become tainted
23884440	23886440	Main control apple
23887120	23889120	I
23893360	23895360	Okay, again same thing
23895520	23902640	Unfortunately, this is very awkward and you can call in your recruits, but it's not very good at all. I'm try
23903040	23905040	Okay, this isn't working wait
23905880	23911320	He attacked me and he died. Did you see that right? I'm just calling in my recruits. They're not very strong, but
23912320	23918480	We'll try we'll try I don't normally like doing it because recruits can definitely die at this section
23918920	23922200	because of the overwhelming amount of enemies that
23922800	23927320	Letting enemies that come in but again white mark around who you would wish to
23928000	23931520	Eliminate right off the bat and hopefully my assassin recruits stay around
23932920	23937360	So he's coming straight for me. So once I've healed up again
23937960	23941560	You just need to do the white you can also see the white line on their
23942680	23946600	The horse knocked him out of range. So we'll need to try that one again
23947640	23949640	So they're now fighting each other
23951360	23953360	Again white line
23953520	23954760	Got him
23954760	23957680	Yeah, see my assassin recruits are getting damaged on their health
23957680	23961720	I really do not enjoy calling them in on this mission. It is dangerous
23961720	23966240	You can lose recruits here if they're not leveled up enough. I really did not spend much
23967360	23969000	Where's the apple?
23969000	23971600	Whoa, he's like slow mo getting me
23972280	23976040	Okay, we've got two more to go two more to go let him get up let him get up
23977640	23982960	But go for him first cuz you actually know we won't cuz my assassin recruit just did that. Oh
23983800	23988800	Someone's load not good. Not good. This is why I really don't like I really don't want anyone to perish
23989560	23991560	Oh
23993160	23997440	Did he survive I didn't get a notification saying that one passed away. I
23999280	24004240	Know you much of an ASMR enjoyer, but any change your mind. That's fantastic
24005280	24009800	I like you. You just got to find someone that fits your groove and they can interest you into something new

24364620	24371860	For the phones about to explode honestly, I hope not, but it's very hot. I think because it's charged like I've charged it
24373780	24375780	This entire time
24376540	24378540	Like it's got charger
24379540	24381540	Oh

24407860	24410060	Not the whole oh, wait, no, I lied
24412820	24415820	I lied I thought all the horsey's got no
24417980	24419980	I
24420020	24425220	Completely forgot I thought all the horses go back up. Why would they do that at the end of the game?
24425220	24427220	I assume I'm allowed to be spotted
24428780	24433580	Doesn't matter if I get spotted or is this one of them ones where I shouldn't be spotted
24437180	24442100	No, I can be spot, that's absolutely fine with me
24443420	24447140	But they're heavy mason heavy infantry
24449300	24451820	Doesn't matter if I get spot, so I'm just gonna send it I
24452900	24458620	Can't believe I forgot about that horsey war see I do apologize. I don't like when they do that
24459420	24465380	He's just taking a nap. He's just taking a nap. I mean I take one too, you know, he needs to sleep off
24465380	24467380	He needs to sleep off what happened
24468460	24471660	No, you've not seen me before unless you know
24482980	24484980	The batteries swelled up
24485940	24490140	We did I left my Android phone on charge for you and the battery so like
24490860	24492900	Like pop like a balloon type swell
24495380	24497380	It's his dangerous
24507500	24509500	Honestly, pray bruising
24509620	24511620	Ah
24515500	24517500	Leave me alone
24523780	24527780	Unfortunately for this section both factions will target you
24531460	24537820	So the best advice really is to go at the checkpoint and destroy whoever goes for you
24539500	24544580	And they will always sign but you can't progress until they leave you alone
24544580	24547620	So just I can't actually see what's going on, but thank you
24549340	24553140	Okay, there you go. You just need to wait for them to leave you alone
24554780	24558500	Any water my battery make sure it's not too cool and it too hot
24561580	24565560	Yes, it's so the smartest thing to do is to claim the burning
24566020	24570200	Siege tower you're you're so smart the wooden flammable siege tower
24571320	24573320	Not sure about that one it's
24574280	24576560	Like your accent. Thanks spawned in with it
24579520	24582560	Spacey phone pillow keeps your pillow nice and warm
24584360	24586360	Do we need to take the rooftops I actually
24587600	24592520	Well, that was a lot of enemies to appear on the screen
24592600	24595720	This section is the same where both factions will target you
24598680	24602800	You need to become an anonymous can I hide behind this and
24604360	24607900	Be left alone. Oh, is he gonna attack me?
24612440	24614440	Okay, okay, I
24614680	24620240	Was trying to see if I can get away with it. It's just a bit like why would they both randomly target me?
24620240	24621600	I have no
24621600	24627040	Like fight with them, but I don't even know who they're they're fighting each other and they're the same
24628240	24631760	They have the same uniform on they found the traitor
24635160	24637160	I know what wrong when I'm gonna guess
24639160	24641160	Leave me alone
24644720	24647320	Right, let's try again this time it's not on fire
24647320	24652000	My world's on fire, how about yours?
24653560	24655560	No, I
24655800	24661920	The water's getting thin the water's getting warm so you might as well swim. Mm-hmm. I don't know the words
24661920	24663920	I can never remember what I
24664720	24672080	Can never remember words in order of like actual songs and then the best I can do is go
24672360	24674360	Ah
24674680	24679760	The back streets a never gone what you wanna say banana banana, what you gonna do?

24733000	24736240	Trying to pistol whip try again with the tip. Oh
24738440	24744280	It's actually much easier just to shoot Chasry there if you should have you take a health bar
24746360	24748360	And removing his armor
24750360	24754060	He wishes he was a farmer. Oh, he got me first

25016340	25018340	Just a bit of I said we belly
25019100	25021100	Hey, maybe it has something to do with this
25030780	25032700	Symbol matches the one on the door to the vault
25034700	25037260	1419 1420 1421
25037940	25042580	What if they aren't dates 1419 1420? Oh
25044140	25046220	My god, what?
25047700	25049060	God
25049060	25055140	Tell us already. I am I am that I am the tetragrammaton the 72 names of God
25055140	25058300	You see they're all contained within three verses
25058500	25065220	Exodus 19 through 21 and to get this your likeness if you arrange the four Hebrew letters in God's name within an equilateral
25065940	25069940	Triangle, then you miracle values add up to the same number
25070700	25073200	72 are you absolutely sure about this?
25073660	25076540	That's kind of why I'm saying it out loud Rebecca. Yeah, but
25079060	25085780	Construction on the Colosseum began in the year 72. I think we have our password
25086540	25088540	Sean go get the van
25088860	25090860	We
25093980	25100420	Now know the password to the vault in order to get the apple of Eden
25102180	25104780	I'm a calibrate again. Hold on. I
25109620	25111620	Calibrated now my mouth
25113380	25115380	You know everything
25116060	25118060	Really?
25119500	25124980	That's right, I've seen your car that tunnel should lead under capital line hill. I'll help them find another entrance
25125660	25131020	Be careful Desmond. I'll drive. Ah, yeah, nice try. I've seen your car. Oh
25133300	25136140	Base the sassans creed said women bad driver
25142140	25147460	That's terrible dev team you knew exactly what you're doing putting that in
25149140	25153820	There's a lot of dialogue up heads. I'll try and be quiet
25155860	25157860	Lucy I'm making my way toward the entrance
25164860	25166860	I'll keep that in mind
25178540	25180900	I can't believe I'm actually gonna hold the apple
25185340	25189100	Wonder if it'll change this whether it can tip the scales in our favor
25189780	25193740	Me trying not to read it like say every quote that I remember I
25194940	25198220	Was gonna say tip the scales. I don't know if the make pick that up by literally
25201900	25204940	What do you think we'll find hopefully a map
25208700	25210700	Yeah
25211700	25213700	Hey, maybe this time we'll be lucky
25218700	25224820	On my first playthrough I never found this for like ages it's so slight and cheeky
25227260	25231420	Cheeky like my little rhythm so much construction this place is like a maze
25239380	25241380	I
25242860	25244860	Know
25245660	25251220	So at the end of this there's a quote from the gods
25253380	25256220	And I said a message
25257780	25259780	No, we hold on
25260740	25263060	So that's why we're playing this game on my birthday
25265020	25267580	Because it's October 10th in the present day
25268700	25270700	72
25275140	25278460	It's the door code someone wants to make sure we get it right
25285900	25287060	Okay
25287060	25289940	If I don't move the cutscenes not gonna begin
25290380	25296100	But I just want to say there's a quote from the God at the end of this and she says go forth and
25296620	25300860	And and I may or may not have said be embraced by the six
25301620	25305300	Because of that quote and I hope you understand it when you hear it
25307060	25311580	So be embraced by the six it's cuz it's all in my love
25313900	25315900	And the other is the six
25317380	25321140	Just wait for okay, just wait for it. I tell you I tell you I show you I show you
25322220	25325100	But I hope the six have embraced you dearly
25327020	25333100	I'm braced us by the no set six number six numeral in those today's quadros
25333620	25336260	Cincuses, I know it's kind of hard just
25339660	25341900	We commit to this space the epilogue
25343260	25347660	Let it be found by he who is deemed worthy let it guide him
25348140	25350140	Let it shape his path forward
25350660	25353180	Let it save the world we leave behind
25354020	25356020	Who are you?
25359300	25361300	Jino
25367540	25371460	We're getting close boys to the end. I don't want it to end but

25539900	25546740	Where we can all just nerd about history and like the things like they even bother to do the text and stuff like under the
25546740	25548740	Paintings to be like this is from
25549580	25551580	like

25568100	25570100	You've experienced
25578140	25581660	That guy is sassy Sean is a very sassy character a
25582660	25585140	Very British deadpan
25588020	25591940	Wow ready to speak to the gods
25611980	25614780	Hey, actually, I'm a he him. Sorry
25631700	25633700	Destroyed what we could feel the way of
25636300	25638300	Something's open
25641660	25643900	Does not take many to unwind the world
25646540	25648540	Here is a safe place
25649180	25652500	eternal to store objects words
25653580	25654860	wisdom
25654860	25656860	But not life
25656860	25658860	Almost did we have the means?
25659460	25662620	But time erodes time. He wrote us
25665820	25668940	We distract him we can see past him
25668940	25670940	We left when he strikes right
25671620	25673620	But his reach is so very long
25674220	25676220	It's stamina unending
25677140	25679140	We cannot evade his grasp
25679140	25681140	not forever
25683580	25687260	Here goes so she's telling us why the gods perished
25688620	25691900	Because something constantly is getting them
25692980	25694980	Just like strutting stamina
25695780	25698980	Yeah, I reclaimed you like that my stamina's unending
25700460	25702460	It's a shame you have a refractory period
25708380	25711660	It must come in with the blood
25725740	25730220	I'm I'm Sean in this one
25733380	25735580	I'm holding on to the little knob in the middle
25740980	25742980	Well, we're doing it
25743500	25747260	If you want to kill us mate, you're gonna have to try a little harder than that
25750660	25752660	We're here
25753500	25755500	Music
25756860	25758860	Beautiful scenery the details
25765100	25768580	That is Sean's right that is I'm always right
25769380	25775780	About that dead end that never happened. I was misquoted music picks up and you can hear the voices
25777620	25780940	Just a theory all sounding voices
25783460	25785460	And all
25787060	25790580	This milk the door is it I'm not being pranked why this is a little in the door
25791820	25793700	I'm being pranked
25793700	25798220	It's really a secret behind that the kind of lucid there may be a secret, but maybe it's just a reuse that's it
25803020	25809300	Think it speaks English just say it okay 72
25812660	25814660	Oh
25839140	25841140	There's a field
25842660	25844660	I
25848100	25850100	The apple seems to be in the center
25853460	25855460	I'm to find out where those temples are
25857780	25864700	Okay, no, this is where the sad part comes in because I always mess up the sequence. I'm really
25864700	25866700	I
25872220	25876100	Always mess up the sequence the orb
25887780	25889780	Big lady
25890780	25892780	Knowledge
25894700	25896700	Only try
25898260	25901140	On a wisdom no knowledge story wisdom wisdom
25903180	25905180	Knowledge
25906900	25908900	Of course not fake gamer
25912580	25914580	Try to join you
25916540	25918540	Hear the words
25919540	25920540	I
25920540	25928260	Have played this game so many times. I always end up failing the levers. I didn't know you could eagle sense the lever. I
25929580	25934100	Have just literally my brain said maybe one's highlighted and the other isn't
25934900	25937740	How many times have I played this game and never done that before I?
25938460	25940460	Always mess up on the lever
25941700	25943700	I'll be quite
25948540	25950540	Activated
25953860	25955860	Did you hear any of that I
25961020	25966020	Sure do love all my friends equally. I love Rebecca
25966020	25972700	I love Sean and I love Lucy and I'm sure all will be fine
25973340	25975340	Wait, where'd I go? Oh
25978540	25980540	Oh
25999420	26004540	So where are the temples you want me to ask it or think it
26009140	26011140	I
26012740	26014740	Sure, you asked it the right thing I
26015420	26017540	Know this
26017540	26019040	That's a frigid cat
26019040	26022660	It stands for freedom and that that's a Masonic eye
26023260	26025660	Now those two come together in only one place
26027660	26033260	I can't move your DNA communes with the apple you have activated it
26034220	26038980	Let me go on the 72nd day before the moment of awakening
26039460	26041220	You
26041220	26045460	Loins and the loins of our enemies the end and the beginning
26046100	26048100	Abhor and honor
26048220	26050220	The final journey commences
26051100	26055820	There is one who would accompany you through the gate. She lies not with our sight
26056540	26059140	The cross darkens the horizon
26063900	26067220	Doing the path must be opened
26068740	26072980	You cannot escape your partners the sales shall be balanced
26076860	26078860	Stop please
26078980	26082380	You know very little we must guide you
26087660	26089660	Please
26094260	26096260	No
26108420	26115460	It is done the way lies all before you only she remains to be found
26116620	26118620	Awaken the six
26123260	26125260	You
26140140	26142140	Really don't like that
26143900	26145900	Really don't like that
26146020	26150060	For those of you who haven't played Assassin's Creed 2 and don't mind spoilers
26151060	26156380	We were in upstairs goes headquarters and she broke us out
26156820	26160980	Because she was pretending to be a Templar. She's actually an assassin
26161780	26165940	and then we have just played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, which is
26167260	26169260	sequel and
26170300	26174820	She got identified as a double crossing agent twice over
26175580	26177580	Which made no sense
26177660	26179660	Because why would she break us up and
26180940	26186740	If you want to know the real reason why Lucy is killed off in it's your story
26186740	26188740	Oh, yeah, sorry in Desmond storyline
26200460	26206780	The reason why Lucy's character was killed off is because she asked for
26208580	26210580	Like the revenue
26211940	26216700	Not for like a payout for her voice, but for the revenue split thing that they do
26217740	26219740	No, I can never remember the word
26220780	26225860	like where you get like payouts constantly like for your voice and
26227780	26233140	Royalties yes royalties. She she knew she was onto something
26233140	26240020	She was an Assassin's Creed 2 then she's in a second game Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and she said royalties and
26240340	26243020	That end sequence was then created
26243500	26249900	Because at no point do the gods speak of present-day issues and if you listen to the gods words
26250420	26257300	It was like you don't understand. We need to teach you the gods should not interact with Desmond on that level
26257660	26259500	lower-wise and
26259540	26265100	Because she wanted royalties killed her and plot and they said yeah, well, we don't need you anymore
26266100	26270260	So thanks, Ubisoft absolutely destroyed Lucy's storyline
26271940	26273940	And
26273980	26277380	Yeah, I hope your shareholders are happy because you ruin it for the people
26278940	26282820	But other than that other than that really annoying fact
26285300	26287300	Otherwise incredibly good game
26288300	26290260	Incredibly good game
26290260	26297940	I like to pretend that Lucy is still fully alive and acting as a an assassin and all of that. So yeah
26307900	26311500	Oh the VA for Rosa passed away, I didn't know that
26317620	26319620	Oh
26322460	26326620	But yes, that is the story of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood as
26327620	26332460	absolutely 10 out of 10 game experience if you ignore
26333220	26335220	the very
26335420	26338220	ending dialogue and occurrences
26339220	26345940	But that was amazing game and I absolutely loved nerdin about it. I'm probably gonna do the board to tell us
26345940	26347940	I don't think I'm ready to go off stream just yet
26348780	26354820	So sorry for anyone who's perishing right now and their eyes are bulging out of their skull because of how much they need to
26354820	26359820	Sleep right now. I'm very sorry. I'm really enjoying this game and
26360700	26361780	Yeah
26361780	26367740	Are you still doing the second stream? Yes. So today I was to finish the campaign mode and tomorrow
26367740	26374980	We're gonna 100% this game because I have never 100% at this game before always wanted to try never did it
26374980	26379700	I believe I may have a hundred percent of Assassin's Creed 2 achievement wise
26381140	26387820	Which was like a nightmare trying to get all the feathers, but we can talk about that when we play it on
26388620	26391720	June June on October 8
26397660	26401860	A lot keep going I've got a couple more hours in me. Oh, yeah, damn you got a stamina minute
26404980	26406980	Mmm
26407300	26409300	Yes, um
26409940	26412140	All the feathers took so long
26414620	26418860	Schedules set for October so my birthday is October 10th
26419260	26422900	Which is when I will do my doughnut on and for my birthday
26422900	26428420	I would like to play Assassin's Creed brotherhood all over again, but I'm gonna play it see was lying
26428420	26432420	So on the 8th of October Assassin's Creed 2
26433420	26443220	a campaign then Assassin's Creed 2 again for 100% and then brotherhood on the 10th and 11th and then on the
26444060	26448260	12th and the 6th the 12th and the 13th would be
26448660	26451540	Revelations and we will complete its use storyline
26452420	26454420	I'm not very well versed in
26454660	26459300	Revelations I have played it a couple of times, but I'm not as well there. So I probably can't Japanese
26460300	26463700	About the best strategies for the game
26466020	26469940	Are you doing the strong you pass out any presented? I don't know like I
26470580	26475820	Want I've been looking at some ASMR challenges like the eight hour ASMR stream challenge
26476140	26478620	Maybe I might consider that although my voice
26479100	26484540	Breaks pretty quickly for ASMR and whispering is the most damaging thing I can do
26484940	26486940	Oh
26487260	26490460	You should watch embers after revelations
26494380	26501100	I would make a reminder for those days I'll be posting my schedule like I've posted my schedule for this week
26503140	26508800	After the needy streamer overload, I think it's like a two-hour game question mark
26509300	26514140	I actually need to go and buy the American candy
26514900	26520620	And those European suits that I don't buy them and then I need to like clean my desk and stuff
26521780	26523780	For cuz I'm doing a hand-cam stream
26526220	26527740	Hmm
26527740	26531540	Stray if mummy go is our mum are you the granny?
26532980	26536780	Don't look into the lore too much of a real or came to be
26538220	26540700	Technically there are five children birthed from my loins
26541140	26543140	I
26543580	26545580	Whispering bad for your voice. Yes, I
26545940	26549660	May or may not need a really big pee now that I have just been aware of my bladder
26549660	26551660	I just sat on my foot
26552100	26554420	Like against well, you know
26555060	26560940	Against what and then my brain was like oh by the way sensation. I mean, ah, yes. Yes. I believe I need to pee
26561340	26563340	Oh
26567740	26572380	Mother Mary virgin birth, uh, no, sorry, it was the reeflings doing oopsies
26573500	26580060	That is some are both going wild. That's all I'm saying. Hmm. I don't know how we got it. We didn't get kicked out of that convention
26584700	26588660	So I am taking jinkies of water which closes tracking and puts my hypnosis on
26589620	26591980	But yes, we'll take a very quick pee break
26592780	26599740	And I may make a second cup of well be my third cup of tea, but my second that I'll drink on stream with you
26599740	26605300	I just need water and drink. I actually don't need any food that those snacks really satiated me
26605300	26610300	I have been satiated. I thank you for letting me eat on stream
26610300	26612300	No, no, no, no
26613500	26617500	Stream elements is how we pay child support. Yeah, I don't know what's going on
26617500	26622780	I unironically think you guys were given like so much money collectively to the girls
26623340	26627620	Once the tip page was up that you guys broke the PayPal
26629660	26632480	Yeah, so thanks for giving us so much money that
26633780	26636620	PayPal is now investigating the account or something. I don't know
26636620	26642940	Yeah, if you want to support the girls you can always buy the merch they get a hundred percent of the earnings
26643340	26647900	None of it goes to the other and all the girls will they say that they own the
26648420	26649940	Ubu market
26649940	26654380	Accounts and all that they have logins and it's all their stuff. We did not touch it not to do with us
26654940	26656940	but yeah
26657500	26660280	Hopefully monetization on YouTube stats
26660840	26668920	Statistics update because my statistics were like, yeah, you have 80 watch hours and I'm like, are you sure about that?
26668920	26672160	Are you sure YouTube? I don't think so

26678880	26680880	Paisa

26811160	26817880	Hey like the enemies in this game as well, have you like made them multiplayer enemies or like
26823160	26825160	I like as well
26825200	26830880	The plot line that love all pay is so like I know it's you
26831320	26835520	Nicolo, I know it's you and like all these things coincidentally happen at the same time
26835520	26840280	I like stories like that because it's like no no you're wrong please
26841560	26846160	But thank goodness we did the no swim part that was awful grabbed a poor man's horse
26846640	26853720	Ran up a side of a building a few times and failed and then like dived across this like beam of rope
26854880	26861760	Would you consider playing binding of Isaac on stream? Oh boy? You're in for a treat in November the
26862960	26868160	official multiplayer for a binding of Isaac goes live and I would absolutely love to play with you guys
26870200	26874640	We will be streaming that game often. I am addicted to it
26875160	26880040	I've not before anyone asked have you done dead God? No, I've not done dead God
26880040	26884160	Hey, I currently am at like I think it's like
26884960	26888600	1001% and it's stop that's where I'm at on one fail
26888600	26893560	I have absolutely nothing on the two other save files, but I definitely is gonna be a
26894240	26900800	Consistently multiplayer streamed game from bits like I'll do like 12 hour runs for the multiplayer game of that week
26900800	26903900	And then like we'll pick up a different multiplayer game type thing and
26905120	26907120	Which would be fantastic
26909240	26916120	Whoo bending of Isaac is hardly it is a random eyes kind of dungeon
26917400	26921700	Crawler, but there's a lot of interesting story in the background of it
26922200	26923480	I
26923480	26930440	Really enjoy it. I actually want to make a review on this game Assassin's Creed brotherhood and as well as
26930840	26933240	Binding of Isaac and call to the lamb
26933800	26937040	Basically, I want to make like real game reviews
26937040	26944840	But only on games that I think we're 10 out of 10 because I can't stop yapping about them and like bring it up like how flawless the
26945640	26953200	In rewarding like the gameplay is and how they've like done the tutorials or what aspects have just really stood out
26953200	26957000	Like I just really like it anything would be so nice to try it like
26957520	26963240	As much as we all like to dog on like video game journalists and stuff like it is definitely
26966200	26973600	Please keep yapping enjoy it if you like the binding of Isaac, I highly recommend no, it's I have never heard of no, it's a
26974840	26979040	And is it like pixely like Isaac as well?
26981040	26985160	From how you talking here would be awesome at giving some game reviews, uh
26987000	26989000	I've got it as a donut on
26989200	26996320	Like reward it would take a lot of effort though. Like I definitely think after my donut on is finished
26996400	27003000	I'll probably have a few shorter games back-to-back and the reason for that is because I'll be like working on rewards. I
27004920	27011680	Literally want to like fire the rewards as soon as possible like once it's done and like all of that
27011840	27013840	Um
27014160	27019000	Not here runs can go for hours. Oh Isaac runs are like one hour
27019600	27025760	Sometimes if you get really good items and stuff you can be wrapped up in 30 minutes with Isaac
27028360	27030040	Yeah
27030040	27035960	Start each review with a five-minute hypnosis section where you turn your own your hypnosis say you will like this game
27035960	27038880	That's so good. You will like this game. You will like this game. You will like this game
27041680	27044480	Have you considered collab of girls playing?
27046000	27048000	Battleground three
27048360	27050360	What's bg? Oh
27050840	27052840	No, what's bg?
27053080	27055080	Battleground right up in background
27056880	27060680	Baldur wait the Baldur's gate is multiplayer. I've never played it
27062040	27066160	What did I've never played it and realized it was multiplayer
27067160	27071700	Big Baldi's gate right so we have just done it
27072520	27074520	We are officially
27075320	27077480	Goodness gravy. We have a lot of money on our persons
27077920	27081200	This is a bit more money than I think you actually need it. So
27082200	27085000	It's given capitalism. It's so it's good capitalism
27085760	27087760	Put it back and invest in properties and stuff
27087760	27093440	I am going to send the birds away. Yeah, sorry. I'm going to send the recruits away to level up a little bit
27094200	27098680	I'm going to do a peep. I'm going to make a cup of tea. So a three-minute break, please
27099640	27101640	heavily recommend that you
27102880	27106960	You know get up walk around stretch your legs and do a little pee-pee as well
27107960	27112000	and we are going to do the Borgia towers next and
27112800	27114800	then maybe
27115560	27117560	possibly
27118080	27120080	and
27120440	27124960	Maybe some other miscellaneous stuff. That's just wrong
27126040	27131000	I'm trying to find something that both of those last two recruits can go on. I mean, I'm got a
27132640	27134040	Oh, you're not strong enough
27134040	27137800	So I'll send you on a mission on your own and then for a level two
27137800	27141960	I will send you on a level one mission because I really don't want anyone to perish
27142760	27145560	He I know you could go up on Baldur's gate. That's so cool
27146560	27147960	And
27147960	27150320	Yes, I will definitely look into Baldur's gate collab
27150320	27154040	I would need to research the game before I play because I really don't know what it's all about
27155400	27159960	And okay, I am going to go pee pee because my bladder feels like it's about to burst
27159960	27164460	I will tell you if it's neon or not. Don't worry before anyone asks. I can already read your mind
27165480	27167480	but I'll do the thing where I
27168360	27173920	I'll mute and then put the game back on in the background and no one can see from me up here
27174160	27179120	Like that guy that yoinked that thing from me when I was away for like two seconds. It's sort of it
27179840	27183120	Okay, please consider getting up and going for a
27184160	27186160	pee pee in a lake bridge. I will be back
27187040	27189040	Incredibly short like hold on me. Yeah
27203920	27205920	So
27233920	27235920	So

27568800	27570800	Oh
27571840	27575520	Gee sure would be a shame if we put some more sass on the screen wouldn't that
27577040	27582360	Did you stretch your legs or did you stretch your feet if you're still sitting down?
27586040	27588040	Go fish, okay
27588200	27592000	Right first things first on the realest. I'm not
27593080	27597440	We are going to liberate the Borgia zones as you can see we've done two more
27598320	27603120	And now that we have arrow storm we can do these extra super difficult ones
27603840	27605360	So there's five more
27605360	27606640	Borgia zones
27606640	27612400	And what we'll do that and we might do layers of romuli romulus. I keep saying romuli. I don't know why

27796160	27800400	Oh, this is one of the worst. You need our storm to complete this one as well
27803120	27805120	Emmy's ASMR got deleted

27886640	27888640	I don't know
27889040	27890800	Hmm

27896480	27898480	know to be
27899760	27901760	Sucking sounds of an alternative
27902480	27904240	variation

27919920	27921920	teasing i'm teasing
27922160	27929680	As long as emmy had a good stream and um her pin pals were enjoying themselves

27964720	27966720	Pen pals had fun
27966960	27972640	Then guess what all is good like it's not a big deal or for me. It's not a big deal anyway
27973200	27978960	I assume she's fine and everyone's safe and having a good consenting time. It's all that matters at the end of the day
27979520	27984320	Uh, she's happy. I'm happy and if she's not happy, I'll try my best to make her a happy beam
27985600	27987600	um

28058320	28065360	It turns out it's he was actually one of the worst magicians and he's just gonna stick to his daytime job of assassinating people
28068160	28071680	Repfield reference. No, I'm sorry. I don't know
28072800	28079680	I don't know what a lot of references are, but thank you for showing patience for me
28081200	28083200	For I am strong
28083520	28088080	On me and there's a ledge that I can climb on so I have to jump
28089840	28098240	And then climb up because I still do not have the climbing glove from the anardo's bench
28099200	28103680	But we're getting there in the end and even the whiffing ish campaign mode
28104320	28106320	I can't not go any
28106480	28114560	Oh, I love how goofy I can be with you guys. You're just like, yeah, I'll just start singing when I'll go for
28121200	28125440	If there's nobody left alive to talk about you you were stealthy
28126640	28128640	What does that mean?
28129600	28132880	Are you meaning? Oh, I forgot to burn the tower
28136720	28141920	It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I love climbing
28142480	28144800	I love overexerting my body
28145440	28146960	for climbing
28146960	28151520	This tower and there were three sides of this tower that are not climbable
28152160	28155600	And I climbed over two sides of tower
28156400	28158400	of the forge of tower
28158400	28160400	Oh
28163200	28167520	I think I'm getting a wee bit delirious and won't be honest. I don't like something that I don't know
28169040	28171040	and
28171120	28172880	Let's see
28172880	28177360	Uh, I've made the mistake again. I have to go on the platform
28179440	28181440	Delilah
28181600	28183600	Where is emi's vod?
28184160	28189520	Unfortunately youtube doesn't seem to like earlicking anymore. So it's no longer there
28190080	28194160	And sadly no, I will not get anyone to re-upload the vod
28194880	28197920	On their channel because it risks their channel
28198800	28204080	I want these girls to succeed and have moneys and emi would very much like to move to a place
28204560	28211360	That has a freaking washer machine and ac and uh, yeah, I I really don't want emi sweating it up in her
28211840	28212960	Uh
28212960	28218960	Current situation. So yes, I would like to wait. No, no, don't jump off. I almost did that again
28220080	28224640	You're distracting me. You distracted me to the point where I almost jumped off twice
28227200	28231920	It's patreon out it is you can find the links in everyone's links
28233360	28238480	Um, the website might have got updated to have our links on it now. I'm not sure

28258400	28262240	I'm afraid I have no content creation advice if you've got a poll
28263120	28265120	I haven't experienced it. So I ain't got none
28267360	28269360	I have no values to you
28271600	28275520	The day out here, can you help me? I would gladly fight for you
28276560	28280160	Normal household functions. I mean she was like I've no got a washer machine. I'm like
28282000	28286000	Uh, I'm starting to think the velar house is looking more and more
28287440	28292640	Something I want to invest in because these poor girls are like I want to move out. I want to do this
28292720	28294720	I want to do that and I'm like
28294960	28300960	Well, I just buy a house and like ship them all out here and then we can just like meme about and stuff
28302320	28304640	Because like could you imagine those collabs?
28305440	28307360	like just like
28307360	28314320	AC bursts into my room and she's like thranny shut up. You're so loud. I'm trying to sleep

28325920	28328000	But I mean could you imagine
28328800	28334400	The noise complaints it would definitely have to be a detached house
28335360	28336160	uh
28336160	28342560	Cause yeah, that's something crazy. I love the idea of a gen content house, but it's hard to actually oh no you need
28343760	28345200	like
28345200	28350880	I don't know if you guys like remember in the call of duty days like was it the optic clan
28351760	28355840	I can never remember but there is like actual streamer gamer houses like that
28356560	28358240	Um
28358240	28360400	Can you email for him? Thank you. Um
28361280	28363280	Right, this is I know
28363920	28367440	You were supposed to write runny zoom ahead. Um
28368400	28375760	But like I remember from eons ago being like that's the coolest thing I've ever seen imagine of all youtubers
28375760	28377760	I watch live together
28378000	28380480	But I remember I think it was like
28381120	28385680	Must have been years ago now. No, not the horse. Okay. Thank god he got off the horse. I got scared there
28386080	28387200	and
28387200	28391280	Tree you're blocking my view of these enemies. I'm just gonna pretend I'm safe ish
28392240	28394560	Uh, can no, no, no, no, don't shoot
28395840	28397120	Don't shoot
28397120	28399120	Stop the bow
28399120	28403520	Oh god, there's horses. I'm scared. Oh, I can hear them
28404240	28407920	I feel like I'm playing slender man with these like guards on horses honestly
28409600	28414160	Oh, I can't sorry. I'm like trying to finish like one sentence whilst playing this game
28415120	28416320	Oh
28416320	28418320	Take this. Okay. Ow
28419360	28420560	Ow
28420560	28421760	I fell
28421760	28423520	Man, I fell off
28423520	28426720	Oh, I'm just gonna let the recruit steal with him. I guess
28428560	28430560	Take that stinky
28431200	28438400	Stinky stinky. Why why are you not attacking him? Don't be scared. It's so it's so I know you've been in the game for a long time
28438560	28440560	But don't be scared like they're not gonna hurt you
28441200	28444880	It's fun as roommates in the beginning it gets really
28446480	28449920	No, like that they're um, sorry to get back to what I was saying
28450000	28454320	I'm sure I read some sort of review of like what it's like to live with other content creators
28454720	28458720	And like I'm pretty sure the default is like it is so loud
28459200	28465360	Um, I so things get crazy and out of hand so fast like you have to learn to live as roommates
28466240	28468240	unironically because
28468240	28469760	um
28469760	28474320	Like who's going to do this chore who's going to arrange for the food who's going to arrange to
28475200	28476880	um
28476880	28480880	Like make sure all is good. Like you don't want to be streaming all the time
28480880	28484400	Like so you would have to get like business internet, which means they don't
28485280	28487280	like um
28487600	28492800	Throttle you if you do too much but business internet is like a thousand dollars per month type thing
28492960	28498000	Like it's absolutely wild when you start to get to like that level of content house
28498400	28500400	Like the bills are
28500560	28502560	astronomical
28504080	28510960	You find out that emi believes in not flushing to conserve what are known wants to do the dishes to preserve their nails
28512320	28515200	Like I absolutely do love it in theory, but it is
28515840	28518000	For me it is not plausible
28519040	28523520	And it's just like it's not happening. Oh look at all. Oh, we've got level sevens
28524000	28531360	Okay, we're getting stronger. They're there. It's not perfect, but definitely getting stronger
28531840	28537200	I am going to send some lower levels away
28539680	28541680	Um
28544720	28546720	That's not gonna work
28546960	28550960	Okay, I'm actually just gonna have to send the lower levels on a level up one
28551120	28552240	Um
28552240	28558480	Oh, well, it's not really like they're you don't lose an assassin signal if you have six available recruits
28558560	28564560	So it's not a problem that I cannot send them on a bigger thing. I am however, we're gonna save this poor guy
28565680	28567680	I'll send again this recruits
28568240	28571840	It's a cool concept. Honestly, I absolutely adore it. Like especially
28572640	28573920	um
28573920	28575920	Oh this isn't good
28577600	28579600	Oh no
28579920	28581920	Oh, no
28585920	28592480	Yikes, that was that was not how I imagined we'd save the citizen
28594720	28598480	Uh, anyway, let's move on to the next Borgia Tower. Shall we?
28600720	28603120	Okay, I think I need to go down
28604880	28607600	I'll take you. Hello, Mr. Horsey. You're my problem now
28610400	28612400	Oh
28612720	28616160	And that might be a good concept that could be for like a smart group club. Yeah
28616880	28618240	definitely
28618240	28622240	Like I said to the girls like as obviously relationships progress and stuff like
28622960	28626880	If you are genuinely serious about like wanting to meet up with each other, um
28627520	28629520	Like it's a business expense
28629520	28632160	and like we can do it but obviously like
28632880	28635360	We've known each other for like two months now, but
28636320	28640480	Yeah, I guess a bit early to like start shipping each other to each other's houses and that like
28641040	28643040	I definitely think we should let things
28643440	28647840	You know some of our relationships form and all that like I I can confidently say like I'm 100%
28648400	28651440	Comfortable with the girls, but obviously there was a lot behind it. It's like
28651920	28657280	Uh, because I like hired them and scouted for uh, no scout is not the right word
28657600	28659600	Oh, I don't want to do a lean or do division
28660480	28661680	mission
28661680	28663040	um
28663040	28668720	I didn't scout for any of them for any of you. So I'm gonna start off now. There was no scouting. Um
28671280	28672560	Um
28672560	28676240	Like there's a bit of truth and like I see myself
28677280	28680720	A little bit in all these girls and like I want them to succeed silly
28681360	28683360	and
28683680	28685680	Like and
28686000	28688000	Where am I going with this?
28688240	28689920	Whoa
28689920	28691920	I don't think I can keep this guy alive
28692640	28696400	He's picking on the guy with the lance first that does the most freaking damage
28697840	28699840	Please pick the others
28700960	28706960	No, let me go first citizen with no armor or weaponry. Goodness gravy
28708720	28710720	Um, you're such a good father
28710720	28716960	Yeah, but like unironically I do see like a piece of me in each of them and I just want them nothing to succeed
28717520	28722160	But I feel like 100 comfortable and confident around them. Like I don't feel any
28723680	28725680	Like any anything, um
28727600	28729440	Uh
28729440	28733200	Like we had a lot of um side comments that were like
28734640	28739680	Sorry, I'm a bit new to the terminology. It was called infighting which is like we're
28740880	28746720	The girls like we would compare our viewers and be annoyed at each other or something. I'm so sorry
28746720	28753120	I was quite new to the terminology if I'm getting it wrong and it was like, oh how long until they start hating each other and it was like
28754320	28757920	Like if you guys could see the behind the scenes of us like memeing about on games
28758400	28763280	Or having like a fun little gossip or just like having a good time together and I'm just like
28764160	28765200	I
28765200	28772000	honestly do not think any of them are capable of that and like you guys already know my stance like if it's
28772880	28776480	Um, like I just want them to succeed. I just want them to have an amazing time
28776480	28780560	I want them to like achieve their goals. Um home improvement achievement of love
28782720	28785040	The fart barrier was broken day one
28786160	28788160	Funny you mentioned that um
28789600	28794720	When the girls like when we had the first meeting so I had to schedule a meeting
28794720	28798960	But I said to them it's not a meeting like I'm forcing you guys to like do
28799920	28805200	Like, you know when offices make you play games like oh have played this game with your co-worker
28805600	28809280	Uh, I've forgotten what the name is like forced like get together time
28810160	28811680	um
28811680	28817120	I've completely forgotten the name of it like when offices for icebreakers, I guess like
28817680	28820560	There's a bit more of a deeper team building
28821120	28827600	Team building exercises. Yes when we had the first meeting I was like, right. What game are we gonna play?
28828160	28831920	Um, and we figured out a time and we played video games
28832400	28837200	And we played for around two hours and our first thing and we were all just giggling because I was like
28837440	28843440	Oh, I'm only going to make it like one hour long because I don't want anyone like overexerting themselves
28843440	28846080	like it was the first time we had
28847120	28853360	Um interacted and we ended up going over the two hour mark and we were just like laughing our little butts off and then
28853440	28858080	Sorry, I'm not paying attention to the game. I'm like literally dying and I'm just like teehee my girl's teehee
28858640	28860640	And like none of us wanted to go
28860960	28866960	But I I did it at the wrong time. So ac was like up pretty late. Um, so she had to go
28867600	28872560	Um, but just like it went fantastic and everyone was so nice to each other and it's just
28874320	28877840	Okay, I'm calling in the recruits. Hold on. I need help. I'm calling
28878800	28880560	Um
28880560	28883760	And it was just like such a fantastic time and goofing off and
28884640	28889280	Yeah, like instant chemistry like uh, I definitely think um
28890880	28894960	Because of the nature of the agency as well like no one here is like
28895440	28898800	I don't know like judging like oh puritan or whatever
28899680	28901680	Like it's just not a thing
28902480	28904240	Um
28904240	28910960	But yeah, like I just have an absolute fantastic. Oh, I was gonna lose body and I've not done the viewpoint
28912480	28915360	But I've spoken so much. I think my tea might be getting cold
28918880	28920960	Okay, it's getting cold. I'm gonna hop my tea
28923120	28926640	Yeah, like we have her for just collab. Um
28928960	28930960	Wait, wait, hold on
28934240	28940080	They're destroying that tower automatically update the map because if it did I have
28942560	28945600	What we will test it on the next boarder tower
28946480	28952400	I think that automatically updated the map and I didn't have to synchronize the viewpoint. You know that
28954400	28956400	Oh
28957120	28959120	Oh
28961360	28968240	How many times have I played this game and I I didn't know that are you coming or not?
28971040	28973040	Are you
28974000	28978080	Fine, I'll call in another group of assassins to deal with them because what's going on here
28982720	28984720	Yeah
28984960	28989200	Can you guys help her my goodness. Jeez. She almost perished
28995360	28999200	How ironic the the naughty agency ends up is the most wholesome
28999440	29002560	Yeah, like I think it's we're all in the same boat and we're just goofing off like
29003200	29006800	Um, when the girls were recording their scripts for the first time
29007200	29010880	Like they were so nervous and like oh, is this good enough? Is that good enough?
29010960	29016960	And I'm like, you have to start from somewhere like um, mercy for example hadn't done anything
29017680	29021440	Uh, like that before so she was like so unsure and I was like
29022640	29026160	I was sending her homework and it was literally links on the hub
29026640	29033280	And I was like just kind of listen to this and give it our uh, what you think and you know, you can add that next time
29033840	29038800	It is very interesting giving people homework because the homework is literally on
29039120	29041680	Well, you can imagine where
29042400	29043680	Um
29043680	29047040	But like mercy so hot like everyone just like was having a goof off and
29047520	29049520	so good
29049840	29053520	Mercy talking about experience to a point. It was so cute. Can't wait to see more from her. Yes
29054720	29059840	Um, she let me I don't know if you've seen the artwork on her twitter, but she
29060880	29062880	was very, um
29063600	29065200	kind to
29065280	29067280	Tell me about her
29067840	29069840	friendship with um
29070880	29073840	In being you I think it's Celestia. I'm so sorry if it's not Celestia
29074400	29075280	um
29075280	29081600	And I was like just so touched by her story and I was like I might get her a little doodle and surprise her
29082160	29087440	And like I sent it to her and I put a little message and I was just like your story really touched me
29088080	29088800	um
29088800	29094160	And also red string theory is when you were always gonna come together no matter what
29094240	29096240	So I had like a little string in the picture
29096960	29101680	Uh, and she sent me an audio over crying and I'm like, oh my god. I just made her cry
29102160	29104080	I feel so bad
29104080	29107920	But she was like it's happy tears. It's happy tears like thank you so much
29108720	29113440	Um, and I was like, oh my god. It sounds so terrible at a context like I made her cry
29119920	29121920	My girls are all lovely, um
29124240	29127200	Definitely great. I'm looking forward to their one-on-one collabs
29128560	29132720	Yeah, I can say that we have a group collab and one-on-one collabs this month. Um
29134000	29135840	Because we
29135840	29141280	Just everything's just gone so fantastic like so amazing couldn't ask for better like
29142000	29148400	Um, they've like recorded their video game lines. So that's kind of like the next big thing
29148480	29154160	I hope it can be done by next by july. I don't know at what point maybe
29155440	29159120	I'm gonna burp. Oh, pardon me for being so rude. It was not me. It was my food
29159120	29162160	It just came up to say hello and now it's gone back down below. Um
29164880	29166880	Sorry, uh, what was I saying?
29168400	29172080	I have completely and truly forgotten what I was saying
29173200	29175200	um
29176080	29183760	Yeah, the girls have one-on-one collabs this month, which I'm excited and then we have a full big group collab, which I'm very excited about
29184320	29185920	um
29185920	29191680	And then after that it might kind of be like trio collabs or four man collabs
29192160	29197040	Because not every game has six persons possible. Like it's just not happening
29198160	29200160	It's not happening
29200880	29207280	I don't know why like they watch me just like annihilate all those people. Can I go on this? Can I go on the gay bail?
29208080	29210080	Let me hide in here. See they can't get me
29212240	29214240	Um
29214320	29217920	But yes, unfortunately not all games are gonna come as a date
29218400	29225520	Um six people so we're just gonna have to see what's in there the lethal company among us like basically we are so limited
29226400	29230960	Uh, I probably shouldn't actually claim this. Yeah, I was gonna say I should not be claiming this right now
29231280	29233280	I need to wait until I can get my recruit
29236000	29239120	Uh, wait, can I get lost in the hay bails? Stop
29240720	29244560	No, you're not supposed to recognize me in the hay bails. Hold on
29246160	29253040	I just I need my uh one. I need one assassin recruit. Oh my goodness. I need to buy armor. You know that
29253920	29257920	Because that's that is like scary that one. Wow
29259120	29261600	Hold on right. There we go. I can actually finally attack
29262240	29268640	The problem is if you don't have like got a assassin recruits to help you like they properly go for you
29270240	29274800	Sorry, I'm a bit slow. I'm like try talking. Oh my tea. I forgot my tea already
29275840	29278800	What's going on? I can't see because of the camera angle
29280000	29282000	Yeah, take that as we get for annoying me
29283040	29285040	Sir lands a lot more like sir
29286160	29288640	Sir spurts a lot of blood
29289280	29293680	Ha ha I got him. Okay. Let me finish my tea. Oh no momento, please
29305520	29308320	Yep, that's honey tea. All right made by myself
29309040	29311040	Um
29313920	29321200	Um, I think it's just called black tea or uh regular breakfast English tea is what it what it is
29324800	29326800	And then just some milk and honey
29326960	29328960	Uh
29334400	29338480	Right, I need to climb this so I will I will
29339840	29341840	I will claim it by identifying
29342080	29345760	I really need to buy the Leonardo glove because this stuff would be so much easier
29346160	29350000	Right, we are going to test it. The map is not unlocked. I repeat
29350720	29353600	The map is not unlocked, which means
29354240	29356240	Then you go left then you go right
29357360	29361040	No, I can't go right. I have to go left right. I'll go left then. Um
29365520	29367520	Wait
29368160	29371680	Am I going crazy or can I not claim this without gloves?
29374320	29376320	Hey
29377120	29383600	Wait, I actually need gloves to work. I don't recall needing gloves to do this. Is it this?
29383840	29390560	Okay, this looks like it. Yeah, this looks like it. Holy moley moley. Wait up. Wait up over here
29390800	29397040	My goodness, this tower is uh, very uniqueness nature. That took me a whole second together
29397760	29403040	You burp from tea a burp from everything if I eat a burp of a talk a burp
29403680	29407680	Uh, I seem to like gulp air when I breathe unfortunately, which
29408480	29410480	Leads to all of this
29411120	29415200	I knew I could hear that. Yeah. Well, I don't want to go get it right now. So
29416160	29418160	Bye
29420160	29424160	Uh, yes
29427040	29429040	Hmm
29429280	29431280	Okay arrow storm is back
29433120	29438800	Okay, we are not doing the viewpoint because if I ignite this and it unlocks on the map
29439040	29441920	I've learned something new about my game yet again
29445200	29449280	I'm learning I'm learning does it unlock the map
29449280	29451280	Uh
29459840	29461840	It's true
29461840	29468160	It unlocks the map. Oh, I just realized I'm covering up the map, but it unlocks the map if you do destroy the tower
29469200	29471760	You're still playing. I never stop them
29472800	29474800	We've got one more board just on to liberate
29475760	29477760	Yeah
29477760	29480800	It appears there is a citizen that requires our help
29481680	29483680	Allow me citizen
29483760	29485760	Let him go eagle sound
29486240	29488240	Oh, that was not an eagle sound at all
29489360	29493760	Hello, I am your knight in training armor. It's the auditoria da fedenze
29496240	29498240	Deliberation of roma has begun
29499280	29501280	It's running built
29502480	29504480	Yeah, allow me to follow you
29505360	29509680	Started streaming squints eight hours ago. Yeah, I like my game
29510560	29516480	Uh, especially if it's a video game that I have an a tendency for uh, this game
29516720	29519280	I probably played it the most out of all games. So
29520000	29522800	So it's very easy for me to be like
29525600	29529680	With the game actually I should be unlocking these tunnel entrances
29530240	29537920	For fast travel, but I'm a bit lazy. We'll buy some buildings just because I have so much money in me pocket
29539920	29544800	Uh, how many runs in this game it is impossible to say like
29546240	29551680	I probably could comfortably say like over a hundred times just like casually
29552880	29555840	Playing it doing different strategies like some
29556640	29560880	Strategy I'll say strategies and brackets. So when the game started
29560960	29567360	I would like purposely buy all the areas I possibly could and then finish the next act and then unlock everything in that area
29567360	29568880	then
29568880	29569680	um
29569680	29576240	Like completely ignore all the monetary aspects and just go with the weakest weapons or like fully equip them out and
29576640	29578960	Like just all these different variations
29579920	29587120	Um, I did try black flag. Sadly I suck. Um, and I really struggled to get into it
29587520	29593360	I am very by I I just absolutely mogged to that older woman there. I don't know if you saw that
29594880	29599600	I just smashed into her. Um, I did play black flag. I'm rubbish
29601280	29606160	If someone has never played any assassin screen games, should I start at the beginning of the series or the series?
29606160	29608160	We can jump in at once. Ooh
29608160	29611360	That's a harder question to answer
29613600	29615600	I
29616320	29618320	Think you're
29618880	29620880	Hmm
29624320	29627120	From my completely biased standpoint
29627760	29633680	Um, I believe you should start at Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to understand the type of game it is
29634080	29638640	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the easiest game to play in the series in my opinion
29639040	29643200	However, you are going to start in the middle of the story of Ezio
29643760	29647520	If you do want to play Assassin's Creed 2, it's not impossible
29648080	29653520	Um, but you don't have assassin recruits, for example to help you out in a fight. Um, you are on your own
29653760	29656640	You do have mercenaries that you can buy on the street
29657200	29663600	To help you out. It's not impossible. Definitely don't be discouraged. Um, but my recommendation is
29663840	29665840	Ezio's storyline
29666160	29673600	Which is Assassin's Creed 2, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed Revelations overall very easy games to play
29674160	29676160	Revelations got a bit
29676160	29678160	um
29678720	29682800	In my humble opinion, uh revelations
29683840	29688000	Kind of went a bit too far with the notoriety aspect
29688960	29690960	um
29691040	29697360	I understand that you can't just have the same game over and over in every installment. I do comprehend that
29698080	29699200	but um
29699200	29705360	The way they did notoriety and revelations was every time you renovated a building in the district
29706000	29709760	That the assassins owned your notoriety goes up
29710320	29716480	And the district is more than likely to be attacked and if you don't defend it you lose it and
29716560	29718560	And
29718800	29726000	In the nicest way, I don't like gameplay like that. I like to be like, ah, I feel accomplished
29726000	29728240	Like I've just renovated that aqueduct there
29728880	29734560	I feel accomplished because I know I don't have to redo it. It's not gonna get lost
29734960	29736640	I'm not gonna have any issues
29737200	29742800	Um, but I do understand that people like a challenge in their video games or they might enjoy
29743760	29745760	um kind of that
29746000	29752080	Aspect of having to fight back for something like you it's not just earned and it's not just that easy
29752160	29754160	Like no, you have to fight for it. You have to
29754800	29758960	You have a chance to lose that you have an opportunity to get in trouble type thing
29760080	29763600	Um, jeez. What was that achievement airstrike maybe?
29764720	29766400	um
29766400	29768400	I know 73 florans
29769360	29770720	eh
29770720	29774560	The game's having a rough time right now. I think I'm I'm asking it to do a lot
29775200	29777200	Oh, I'm going past the tower. Oh well
29777760	29782320	Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello
29783360	29785360	America
29786480	29791920	Uh, I hate this part with oh my goodness. It's a party on the rooftop, huh?
29793040	29801760	Let me get this tower. Ow my back. Hello. You're hitting my clavicle from the back. That's not very nice
29802640	29804640	Ah, stop it
29804960	29809360	Oh freaking sick. He didn't die. Oh, I need to wait for my recruits to come and help me
29811680	29817200	Why why why would you change camera right there game? I'm getting trolled right now
29818480	29820480	I think I'm just getting tired as well
29821680	29823680	Oh, I love to kill cams
29824720	29825840	No
29825840	29829360	Off him right. I'm calling in my recruits. They're gonna come help
29830240	29833280	As soon as like the AI can pick on someone else
29833360	29837840	It just becomes so easy to take them down one by one. Ow my back again
29838560	29841440	Would you kindly stop my goodness?
29842320	29844320	And I got a thief's guilt for that
29844640	29846800	Oh, I've still not done poison. That's a really easy one
29848000	29852720	How many okay, I have one bottle of medicine left. I was gonna say I actually don't feel like I've like
29853360	29855360	Looted at all
29856080	29858080	Hmm
29858400	29861520	I've never heard of a scotch video game nerd ran and it's perfect
29862880	29864880	Oh, literally like, uh
29865040	29869200	Skyrim's probably the next rambly game. I'm gonna play
29870320	29877520	Um, and just like tell you like all the things I know about the game and like uh gameplay that I've found interesting or good
29878880	29880880	um
29881120	29884800	I wouldn't mind playing cult of the lamb again. That was very enjoyable
29885520	29889600	Um, I can't yapp about it much though because I'm not I don't know much
29889600	29893200	I've only played it once but I really enjoyed it and it was a 10 out of 10
29894000	29896000	pardon me experience
29896480	29901920	Pardon me for being so rude. It was not me. It was my I have played shadow of mordor
29902720	29904880	and
29904880	29908240	I haven't like perfectly completed it or anything
29908720	29911920	But I would absolutely love to play that again
29912160	29914640	I want to give the golem game a shot as well
29915120	29921200	It's like such a oh, we got an achievement called tower of fence by the way because we just successfully
29922080	29923600	renovate renovate
29923600	29924480	um
29924480	29928160	destroyed all bourgeois influence on roma
29929120	29935280	So now we can successfully renovate everything on the map like on this part of the map. We can like buy everything
29935920	29940880	um, so i'm gonna fill up the recruits and uh, we'll buy some
29941360	29943360	locations and stuff
29944480	29947840	Was it literally everyone hated the golem game, but I'm like
29948880	29951280	I mean I assume they've had a few updates
29952080	29954080	from the bugs of the game
29955200	29959760	Oh, I've got a lot of baby assassins right here. Hmm, right. Oh
29960880	29966000	I'll recruit the last assassin wherever they may be. There's no one nearby
29966560	29971120	Um, we will start this top corner. Why not?
29972800	29977760	Uh, and we'll start renovating unless we do a layer of romulus
29978720	29980880	We could maybe do that like now
29982640	29984640	I don't mind
29987680	29991520	Well, you've been streaming the entire time I've been awake. I've been
29992320	30001360	At correction you fool. I've been nerding about my games that I love for eight hours. Haha. You think this is work
30001760	30003760	I'll show you work
30005200	30007040	Wait, um
30007040	30012160	The only reason like I'm able to like do it for so long is because you guys literally listen to me
30012240	30014240	Yeah, but about it for so long
30014800	30018800	Like it's just a good time. I'm having a good time. Um
30019360	30023120	And it's just nice being able to um
30024800	30028320	Just share like what I'm passionate about and
30031760	30038160	Graphics wise this game looks better than golem like does it actually this game is 14 years old
30040720	30044160	Unless yes refling we will fight back
30046000	30048000	No more shall we be
30048240	30050240	Uh, right hold on
30051360	30052640	I don't
30052640	30056720	The best way to go about renovating I think is doing the districts
30056880	30061760	So we're gonna start with this district first. Okay, so we'll just take it from the top
30062160	30065040	And we're gonna buy everything in the game
30065680	30070000	I can't believe assassin's creed brotherhood is actually just capitalist simulator
30070400	30074320	Because look at us now. We had no money at the start and money begets more money
30074320	30077200	You know what I'm saying and don't be confused with baguette
30078000	30080160	Beget baguettes as in
30081040	30083040	more
30083600	30086880	Um, I can't believe this game's just hidden money maker similar
30088400	30090400	They've sucked me in
30090400	30092400	I like really enjoy money making games
30093040	30095040	I just think I'm so fun
30095600	30096960	um
30096960	30098960	I did want to get into
30100400	30102400	Not me game developing
30102880	30107120	But me commissioning a game like being a studio
30108480	30110000	But I don't know what that's called
30110000	30117360	It's not like a publisher because you don't need publishers because publishers are what used to pay for the hard copy of like the xbox games and stuff like that
30118000	30119120	um
30119120	30124240	Like I might get into that at some point not right now. No, dude. So it's not right now
30125600	30130880	Um, like an investor. Yeah, like I will like go to like a gaming
30131600	30135600	Um, like developer and be like, hey, do you want to make this?
30136480	30137920	um
30137920	30141360	And basically they go, yeah, this is how much and I'll be like, okay
30141840	30147040	We will do this deal where you get this much and royalties and I get this much like that
30148560	30150560	I think it'll be kill
30151280	30153280	Make one scrawny
30153440	30155440	million dollars
30156320	30158320	any
30158400	30160400	scrawny stonks
30161520	30164080	I could listen to your ample of games for days
30165040	30166320	Hmm
30166320	30168320	What game ideas do you have in mind?
30168960	30170160	Well
30170160	30177120	So I really enjoy cookie clicker. However, I don't enjoy the aspect of cookie clicker
30177760	30184880	That is the game is so hard to finish and feel like ah, I have achieved the ending of this game
30184960	30186240	I am satisfied
30186240	30188800	So I wanted to develop a cookie clicker
30189280	30192960	That's like a four hour game because because because
30193840	30200640	VTubers and streamers need games that kind of wrap up in four hours
30201200	30205840	Like I think and I think there's definitely like a market for that kind of thing
30206320	30211120	Um, so it'd be very interesting to like find out the formulaic thing in the background
30211200	30216080	But obviously you need like more of a twist. You can't just make cookie clicker and then it ends fast like that's not how it works
30216800	30218800	uh cookie clicker game
30219600	30221600	is a number
30223280	30224720	game
30224720	30225920	where
30225920	30230160	You start with like no money for example or no cookies
30230800	30234880	and then you upgrade stuff via the cookies and
30235440	30239680	It makes more cookies and the numbers go up. I can't remember the type of game
30240560	30242560	it's called
30242560	30243920	uh
30243920	30245520	incremental game I
30245520	30247520	an incremental game
30247920	30252880	Is what cookie clicker is and I think there's definitely a market
30253280	30259680	For an incremental game that you can wrap up in four hours if it had a storyline of some sort
30260400	30261440	um
30261440	30266880	As well as like a replayability factor as well. I definitely think
30267520	30272880	There's a market for like four hour games, especially for VTubers and streamers and um
30273840	30278480	It would definitely be interesting to like go through it together now. I'm definitely nowhere
30279360	30281360	near doing any of that and
30282160	30289520	Like I don't even know where you start and it just becomes crazy legal stuff and
30290400	30291520	uh
30291520	30299120	Just to say the development of VLR took over a year and a lot of stress and a lot of like
30299840	30305360	Issues on the road like things are not straightforward. It's just impossible
30306320	30308320	to be straightforward
30308320	30313360	Uh when it comes to these things and I'm not wanting any stress right now
30313440	30319680	I just want to enjoy streaming like it took so long to get here. So no, we're not doing VLR
30320320	30323200	Uh game development arc. No
30323920	30326880	And for the game the free to play game that does come out
30327600	30329840	again, it was created by
30330960	30333760	Not like an outside source studio
30335760	30340080	Type thing. So I guess I've technically already done that. I mean
30341120	30342880	This game isn't for profit though
30342880	30347200	So I guess like when it comes to like profit games like marketing would have to go into it
30347280	30349440	Like all these different factors would have to go into it
30349760	30356560	But it's definitely something like I'm happy and open to talk about like especially the newest game that we're developing for VLR right now
30357120	30358000	and
30358000	30364080	Once it comes out. I'm happy to talk about the development, but I don't think it'll be surprised to anyone to
30364960	30369280	For me to not be able to show much of the content of the game
30370080	30376160	Oh, I don't think anyone's gonna be surprised. So don't think I'm gonna get like charts out and show like
30376560	30380400	These are the mock designs behind the scenes. No
30381360	30383360	I can't show that
30384560	30386560	It's not appropriate
30388240	30390880	Um, yes, it should hopefully come out in july
30391440	30397280	Um, it still looks like it is gonna happen in july. So that'll be our big announcement in july
30397920	30399920	for be a lower
30400320	30402400	And then we start getting to the other stuff
30403280	30407040	Just we've linked some vibe and literally there is a lot of lost time
30408160	30413520	And yeah, I surely it's uh able to play it on stream. Yeah
30414400	30416240	totally
30416240	30418240	Yeah
30419200	30427280	Yeah, no the game is absolutely fine to be streamed absolutely no issues at all empty faction building
30432560	30434560	Mm-hmm
30437360	30441360	What platforms um, it's gonna be itchio
30443200	30445600	Which is not how anyone reads it, but that's how I read it
30446160	30449280	Uh, so we're at the mercenaries location
30449840	30452160	So obviously the only logical faction
30453040	30459540	For like the mercenaries place like where all the the beefed up macho men are a bit stress relief for the courtesans
30459620	30461620	Eh
30461860	30464420	I have always put the courtesans here
30465060	30468420	Uh, you know, come on these the mercenaries need some
30469220	30472980	Some tlc and we'll bear to do that than the courtesans
30475300	30479140	Uh, we do have an aqueduct in this area
30479220	30482260	I know it's like we've kind of done this little quadrant here as well
30483140	30485140	Uh, and we did do that
30485700	30488180	maybe we'll like do the outside of the map and then
30489620	30491620	Where the heck am I supposed to go?
30494820	30497780	Wait, it was highlighted. Why can't I see on my map?
30500340	30502340	eto
30503140	30505140	Hello, I know
30507460	30509460	A brotherhood are you showing your age?
30510820	30512660	Oh
30512660	30517700	I was bam boozled. It wasn't highlighted properly
30519780	30522660	Mercenaries could have been a good mercy fan name
30524820	30527700	Would a young dairy have guns like that like
30528500	30530260	She'll have gunners
30530260	30531700	but guns
30531700	30533220	nah
30533220	30535220	Yeah
30536420	30540020	I could see you doing a game like ducky ducky. I've never played ducky ducky
30540900	30546260	I think a lot of youtubers have though. Um, but maybe like I think there's
30547220	30553140	Four girls in that game. So maybe uh veal or like reading voice over thing could be a thing
30556420	30558420	Hey
30562820	30569460	Uh, right we've done this kind of section this one here. So we'll do this bottom corner. Oh, there's Leonardo. We go
30569780	30571780	We can purchase the glove
30572660	30574900	I need the glove for climbing reasons
30574980	30576980	No other reason
30579620	30582660	I promise the glove is for wholesome intentions
30584340	30586340	And to suggest otherwise
30589940	30591940	Wait, aw
30592260	30596740	Riding around in my game looking at the sun is so bootyful
30598180	30600020	What a beautiful
30600100	30604420	Recreation of roma back in back in yield days before the internet became a thing
30607300	30611060	But how would uh, how could you stream if you were back then?
30612660	30617460	I guess be a stage presence. Excuse me, mr. Horster in the way
30622340	30627620	Friendly reminder to not lose sleep. Yeah, if you guys need to rest or you need to go, please don't worry
30628580	30634740	Mercy's going live in 30 minutes any mercy modist watchers also known as karambit
30636020	30642180	Uh, any karambit warning in 30 minutes, but please do rest if you need to
30643460	30646820	Or hydrate to you know, actually I'm going to take a sleep
30648580	30650920	Oh, I'm me. Oh, sorry
30651320	30653320	Okay
30654840	30659960	So you cannot access this viewpoint if you do not repair the aqueduct here
30660760	30666760	Which I thought was a pretty neat thing because the game's kind of like hint hint mate. You need to repair stuff
30667640	30672920	And then you'll earn income because I'm sure a lot of people kind of played and missed that part of like you can
30673320	30676200	Renovate buildings and that's how you get money in the game money
30677160	30679160	We
30679480	30686600	This game is my second fave before black flag. Yeah black flag certainly captured a lot of people's hearts
30687320	30689320	Like oh no
30689800	30695640	I forgot it was that jump. I normally struggle to get out of this place so much
30696840	30699880	Oh, can I remember how to get out?
30701080	30703080	Wait, was it that easy
30703880	30705880	to get out
30705880	30707880	No
30708680	30710680	Yes
30710680	30711800	Yes
30711800	30716440	Okay, it must have been chilled me because I like never do that like I never go down there
30716520	30720520	So it must have been chilled me that really struggled to get out there. I just remember being like
30721960	30723960	Back for more designs again
30725240	30730760	The Scottish accent making me think differently. What is rest streamer don't
30731640	30733640	stream now there we go
30734600	30743080	Claim leap glove this reinforced glove allows for faster claiming giving the wearer the strength easily grab handhold many mid-jump
30743720	30747960	Handholds mid-jump. It also deals more damage to enemies when fistfading
30750360	30752360	Wait here, I'll be back soon
30757720	30760680	Yeah, maybe we should get black flag like a really good goal
30761240	30765880	Because people seem to just adore it and I've tried it twice to get into it and
30766680	30769960	I don't think I beat like an hour now. Nothing will be out of my reach
30770360	30776200	No, nothing going bring out on my match. Uh, I think we can oh we can I was gonna say
30776200	30778700	I think we can buy the poison darts as well
30785080	30787800	I don't know if there's like a sea shanty or anything
30790840	30794360	Only a fool could walk past my shop without a decent quick look
30794920	30796920	Only a fool
30797480	30799480	Night night rest well those who are resting
30801080	30804440	Please don't worry about not making it. Uh, I'm very
30805880	30807880	I'm very uh, unfriendly
30813400	30818680	Uh, right, we're just gonna run buying things. Oh my goodness
30819640	30826360	Society all norms. I can't get away from that. I'm such a girl going around buying things man. These gender norms go hands
30827240	30828760	ah
30828760	30832040	Stop it. Stop it. The gender norms are winning
30833320	30837800	Wait, is this the game where you get the wish and well achievement? Oh it is
30838680	30844440	I just remembered that holy moly moly. I just remembered that wish and well achievement
30849400	30853560	Okay, uh, this looks like a thief's district. So I'll just make it thieves
30859080	30863240	Nine thousand florins every
30864600	30869000	20 minutes. I'm in the money. Right. I renovated that but it's not
30870120	30874520	Updating on the map, but that's okay. And then we'll kind of sweep around these section
30874680	30878680	Like maybe we should go outside the map and then in the center. I'm not sure
30882280	30885080	There's a war going on for their benefit
30888040	30892600	Did you know there's a war going on for their benefit?
30895240	30898840	I think odyssey might be my favorite. I didn't get chance to see
30899320	30903080	Yeah, I'm you still playing mommy. I mean mommy. I mean mommy
30905000	30913960	Yeah, we finished the campaign. So now we are going around and buying everything we can in sight because these gender norms have hands
30914520	30916200	um
30916200	30918200	But it means
30918600	30922680	We are getting more progress to the hundred percent
30923480	30926280	For tomorrow because hopefully we can hundred percent the game
30926280	30930120	Which is actually crazy because I've never done it before after considering how many times I've played this game
30930600	30934120	I I'm going to send my recruits to get a bit stronger because
30935400	30940120	They aren't actually all that strong right if I take you
30941400	30943400	Can you take some of these?
30943880	30945880	Pete maybe
30946440	30948440	Do like that
30948920	30951480	Do you get hundred and sixty five each?
30953400	30957720	You know what that'll still level up her that's just fine
30959160	30961320	Level four and then do that
30962600	30966200	And that and that and send them away
30967160	30971160	And then do a level three mission
30972200	30975640	Don't be shy level three mission. I know you're out there
30976600	30978600	Don't be scared
30978760	30984360	Okay, level one you go with level seven and you share the xp
30985320	30990760	And then level three. Yes take two together
30992120	30994280	Okay, just take her as well
30995560	30999240	And then level one mission off your pulp. Okay. We did it
31000360	31003960	Our assassins are all being leveled up and we're getting all the money for
31005640	31007640	Oh
31009160	31014440	I've been trying to think of a marrow to send you but man excited go ahead. Don't worry. I'm brain dead
31014440	31016440	You don't have to be scared of me. Um
31016920	31023640	Some people came to get like brain worms or they're like, oh, she's gonna hate me because I said this or I did this one thing
31024040	31026040	I'm not like that. Um
31026360	31031800	Hopefully if you are nervous and you're just watching and you're just a lurker for now, that's fine
31031880	31035960	But hopefully over time you can kind of just see how we're vibing and
31036520	31041640	You maybe get the confidence to talk but uh, hi lurkers. It's okay if you're shy
31042120	31049720	I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna like call you out or be mean or stinky or anything. It's perfectly fine to be shy and um
31051080	31056360	If you're needing to just hang out and have some background noise on I um
31057160	31059800	Uh, very thankful that you picked me to be your background
31062360	31064360	I
31064840	31068680	Like the vibe so far just being child. Yeah, listen. It's casual. You don't have to
31069320	31073560	No audience participation necessary. You can be as close as you like
31073640	31078280	You can be attached at the hip or you can be an arm's length whatever is comfortable for you
31078840	31083560	I'm just happy that you're happy and if you're not happy
31084120	31085800	I have five
31085800	31091080	Lovely girls who would love to also entertain you in their own special way
31092040	31096440	And I would love for you to check them out if you're just like, ah, I don't think this is quite for me
31097560	31099560	That's perfectly okay
31099560	31101560	perfectly, okay
31102920	31104920	Yeah
31105800	31107800	You are my oh
31108440	31112120	I don't know how I don't know how I
31113080	31115080	like just
31115640	31119400	The just being so inexperienced and like being so
31119400	31121400	Unknowing
31121880	31127400	And like you guys are just so overwhelmingly kind to me when you could have
31128040	31133000	Could have easily have taken the other avenue of being like
31133800	31137160	Oh, this this person hasn't done their research
31137880	31142920	Uh, they're just doing it for this reason that reason and instead you just showed me nothing
31143000	31146680	but like endless amounts of kindness of patience of like
31147560	31154040	Even excitement just to tell me what's what like literally like t s k r
31154600	31156600	And I say tisker
31156680	31160840	And it becomes like a meme instead of like someone could have easily have just been like
31161400	31165160	That's so pathetic. You don't know like the most common phrases
31165960	31171880	And like you you guys are just like so kind to be like yeah tisker. We love tisker
31172040	31177720	And it's just like such a a good freaking time
31178760	31182440	You know, you could have been cancelled for that for a lot
31183880	31185240	and
31185240	31190680	What if I can't choose between all of you I actually have
31191880	31195240	Solution if you can't choose and you're not gonna like it
31196280	31198760	And this is terrible of me to say out loud
31199560	31202440	But whoever caters to your
31205560	31208520	Your willy the most is who you should oh she
31209400	31211400	There's no other way to say it
31211960	31218280	But whoever caters the most is how you should oh she have your struggle and to pick between us
31222680	31227240	Um, yeah, because there's no other way to do it there isn't
31229720	31232360	Like come on, you know, I'm telling the truth
31233400	31238120	Don't let your brain do your thinking let your head do the thinking
31240520	31242520	Why think when your head can do the rest
31243480	31245480	Hey

31293560	31300760	It's really fun to like sit and watch NPCs in this game. Um, um, oh
31301960	31303320	Huh
31303320	31305560	I've just remembered another achievement
31306520	31308520	We'll need to do it where there's enemies
31309800	31312120	Because we can't do it here without enemies
31313160	31315640	Um, maybe I should get on a horse

31386600	31387880	Okay
31387880	31391880	And we get to nerd about our games that we really like and we get to have a good time together

31429000	31431480	In order to avoid this heinous act
31432840	31438120	Okay, um, we're getting close and maybe we won't do landmarks landmarks are
31439080	31440760	insanely expensive
31440760	31442760	We might maybe it's better to do these
31443400	31452520	See the landmarks all come together here like in between these like five is oh, yeah five is like 100 000 florins
31454680	31457080	Now don't get me wrong the banks make money but

31460600	31462440	Nine squillion
31462440	31466360	Florin nine thousand squillion florins isn't gonna do it. You're gonna cut it
31467080	31473160	So we can't invest just take on them a blank check. Oh don't mind the bad
31477480	31480600	Uh, uh, you ready for this achievement?

31527480	31533800	In love with this game. I'm just kidding. It's not a competition of who knows more about the video game
31533880	31538120	If you enjoy your video game, that's fantastic. We ain't here trying to give you a quiz
31538760	31541720	To prove that you've played the video game. That's not how it works out here
31542680	31544680	Not from around here
31547800	31551960	Oh, my assassin recruits gave me tons of money as well. I already forgot that part
31557240	31559720	Do your business with them and broom them fast
31565320	31571080	Is it possible to beat the whole game using a broom, uh, no because it won't spawn in all locations
31572680	31578040	Uh, you cannot do it in all locations. Take a little sip of water

31612760	31617800	Uh, I always struggle to get out of the section of the game. You know what? I'm I'm gonna just jump down the hill
31618120	31620600	I'll just do it and I'll call the horse a bit later on
31621240	31623240	Hee hee
31624200	31627320	I really wet your whistle. I do need to wet my whistle
31628200	31632280	Did you know in Alice Madness Return the old lady says wet your whistle
31632360	31637320	And it used to scare me so much when I played that game. I used to be terrified of Alice Madness Return
31638920	31642040	You know, I'm starting to think I'm just a scaredy cat altogether. You know that
31643320	31645320	I think I'm just just a little scaredy cat
31647480	31649480	Right, let's just buy this
31649480	31651480	Oh
31653320	31660600	Wait, please give mercy my company allocated a mental well. Okay. Good night. Ha ha. No
31664760	31670040	No, not American McGee's Alice. I I tried to play it. I suck
31671000	31674520	And not the good kind. I just was not good at that game
31675240	31679400	I got stuck at the very start on the three-door portal thing
31679800	31683880	I don't know my game was bugging out or I was just too dumb, but I am very dumb
31683960	31686280	So that's the most plausible answer
31689240	31694440	Hi, Johnny. Oh wait, sorry. I just said hi. Johnny is if I was saying your name. Hi, babe
31696280	31699000	Congrats on doing it. Uh, congrats on you
31701240	31703240	How how you doing?
31705240	31711320	I can't believe I said that. Hi, Johnny. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Johnny's me
31714520	31719800	We're playing uh, thanks for saying congrats on doing it. Uh, thanks for watching us
31721160	31725960	Yumi plus was literally one of the only agents one of two agencies that responded
31726920	31732040	Uh, no, I tell a lie. There was a third agency, but due to taming it could not be possible
31732440	31740440	But um, there is very likely to be a third agency as well that we will interact with a lot because they were kind enough to give us the time of day
31741240	31743240	And I'm definitely a
31743720	31747480	Someone that's like if you scratch our back we'll scratch yours, you know
31747880	31750760	Like if you give me the time of day, I'll give you the time of day
31751640	31755400	Anyway, that's that's just my two cents. Anyway, that's just my two cents
31755880	31767480	I just said yumi plus like a dumbass you're being you
31768760	31772680	Sorry, there's a few girls from yumi plus that came in and I have been
31773080	31777640	Streaming for almost nine hours. So my brain is getting out there. But yes, thank you
31778120	31783080	It made again. I apologize from b and u not from yumi plus. I apologize
31783880	31787080	I'm I'm uh getting a bit h2 delirious
31787800	31790040	At the moment just because I love I've been playing
31791000	31793000	But me love me love
31794040	31798760	Prit me praying I say your name right? I like when my accent does it change? But no, I don't
31800680	31802680	Uh, I'm actually gonna
31804440	31806440	Don't want to hear
31807640	31809640	Aren't you supposed to be the one
31810520	31812760	Aren't you supposed to be the one with a mushy brain?
31813320	31815160	Yeah
31815160	31818920	Did you know my biggest weaknesses are mirrors?
31819640	31823000	And I can't wait to be close, but it's terrible, but it's true
31825560	31829560	Is it terrible to tell the truth? I don't know maybe
31830920	31832920	Maybe baby
31834360	31836360	If you tell them the truth
31836920	31838120	I
31838120	31843080	Was juggling three debut watch along the whole time. It's a wild ride. Wait, did other people debut on?
31843800	31846200	Or do you mean? Oh, do you mean their watch along? Yes?
31846360	31850760	You said the word watch along and then my brain completely went over that. That's exactly what you said
31850840	31853560	Yeah, that makes much more sense than what I was originally reading
31854600	31856600	Gee willikers. I'm losing the plot
31858440	31862280	Right, uh, we've kind we're gonna ignore these big buildings
31862760	31866280	Um, these cost a lot of money money. We do not have at the moment
31867080	31870200	Uh, all the funds went into developing the girls sorry tihi
31872600	31876600	We've arrived at seems great now want to see stormy looking in the mirror, which all that
31878520	31880760	Uh, someone suggested it and I'm like
31882520	31886680	Um, because like one of my like top 10 is like
31888040	31890040	Lost
31890040	31895000	Um, and I was like, it's literally perfect. It's like too perfect
31896360	31901640	Um, could you hit the size on yourself in a mirror only by accident like I wouldn't do it on purpose
31902200	31904200	It would be like an accident thing
31907320	31913160	I cannot wait to like do the donathon because I have so many panel like comic strip ideas
31913880	31918760	Um, if you've seen the one posted on twitter, um
31920600	31927400	Uh, that kind of panel comic stuff thing. I love it. I love it with my tongue out
31928200	31929800	of it
31929800	31934520	Cannot get enough of that like like one shot dojin type things
31935960	31945240	I just adore it right um, we're gonna do this viewpoint here. It's not too finicky now that we have the glove. It's not
31946360	31949080	Did I not just select that viewpoint?
31951000	31954040	I did select the viewpoint, but I guess I did it so fast
31955000	31957000	Um, but yeah
31957480	31959480	how would
31959560	31962440	Get out of him it just wears awful retain like my
31963080	31966920	Like my preference for like hypnosis is like it doesn't last forever
31967240	31970920	but I have recorded an audio that removes like any
31971720	31973240	um
31973240	31978680	Effects that I may have given you because I have gone the finger snapping route
31979240	31982680	Um, I quite like the finger snap in both ears
31983240	31984920	um
31984920	31986920	That's just me personally though
31987400	31990760	Um, and I also like the banyuril
31991400	31995560	repeated uh under for subliminal angle as well
31996040	31999960	So I've kind of like done that route, but that's just for me and uh,
32000680	32003640	You know, hopefully people enjoy it very new
32003720	32009720	But I just kind of did what I like because I find if I do what I like
32010200	32012700	Things come out very enjoyable
32013960	32020440	Uh overall whereas like if I kind of feel like forced it's like I doesn't really come out of the way I wanted it to come across
32020520	32022120	You know
32022120	32024120	This is just a viewpoint
32024840	32027400	Uh, aren't you going to condition as well?
32027400	32032520	That's why I've recorded an audio to undo it at any point. So if
32033320	32035880	You don't want to experience it anymore from me
32036600	32043720	Uh, you can definitely listen to it and undo all the thing because you got to be safe when you do hypnosis
32044200	32046200	I did my research
32046680	32049960	And definitely got to be safe got to make sure you're safe
32050680	32054600	And all that jazz so yeah, but uh, I don't really do anything
32055560	32056680	um
32056680	32058280	very
32058280	32064680	Out there um when it comes to the bit mnosis community a lot of things are
32065480	32066600	very
32066600	32068360	Like
32068360	32070360	In that and I'm not really
32070360	32072360	Going that route
32073400	32078360	Doesn't mean I'll I'll never say never never say never because I do like try in my hand and like everything
32078440	32080440	I'm kind of like a finger in the pies
32080920	32085160	Um, I just love kind of challenging myself like that newest audio
32085640	32087640	Uh, I have never really
32087880	32093560	Uh done anything to that degree before I was about to jump off there. Yeah, you won't hey bell. That's fine. Um
32094760	32098600	I have never done that kind of audio before
32099320	32105400	But I enjoyed doing it even though it's not like an interest of mine personally because it was a challenge
32105480	32111960	It was something I had to like go out there and learn about right. Okay. What aspects do people like about this particular thing?
32112360	32114280	Okay, I'm going to incorporate it this way
32114280	32117800	I've seen from like this video that I'm researching they did it this way
32117880	32123560	But I don't have a preference that way. I'd rather it be this way like I like that kind of challenge
32124200	32126600	um for me personally um
32127800	32130440	Which um, I like variety
32131160	32136840	Um, and all that good stuff. Sorry. I'm Emily. I'm kind of a bit passionate about that stuff too
32137240	32139240	But we can talk about it at a later time
32140200	32142200	I don't mind
32143560	32145560	Yeah
32146600	32149880	But yes, that's kind of my thing um, mercy
32151640	32153320	Snip it
32153320	32155320	Call out in three minutes
32155800	32157000	mods
32157000	32164360	You are given permission to link the stream once she goes live and then you're unpromissioned to talk. No, you're too quick
32165080	32169800	You're too quick once she goes live unless she's live. Is she live? She might be live
32171080	32173080	She's probably already alive
32173080	32174120	um
32174120	32177160	Okay, we're gonna do this section. This is actually quite a big section
32177560	32179560	Like you can see these contract missions
32179800	32184060	They go away as soon as you do them so we can 100% like do that, but we'll go for renovation
32187640	32189640	um
32189800	32191320	Yes
32191320	32194760	I am new for anyone who's like I can't wait to hear your stuff
32195480	32198120	Please give me the benefit of the doubt. It's like we kind of
32198840	32201160	You know get into it because
32202520	32208120	I'm new but I am passionate. I've actually always had a thing for it, but I've never
32209560	32211880	The problem is I needed to research it
32212040	32215080	But the rabbit hole gets so so deep
32215560	32218680	Like the first thing I learned was like the safety thing
32218760	32223960	Like I need to do an audio that reverts anything that I might have given someone
32224680	32226680	um
32227400	32233880	Like that was like the first major thing I learned and then the things were like the conditioning like what's your condition thing going to be
32234360	32236360	and I personally like
32236360	32238360	um
32238520	32244840	Double whispering is what I call it and snapping fingers and both ears like fine neural
32244840	32248280	It has to be by neural. It can't just be mono like in the center
32249000	32252360	Um, I like that. So I've incorporated that
32254680	32256680	It's almost 5 a.m. I should
32256760	32260040	Uh get back to the reason I'm pulling on all night our oopsies
32260520	32264120	Please rise well. Thank you for hanging. I apologize for taking on your sleep
32267240	32271160	Yeah, I like subliminal whispers as well that are by neural
32272200	32278680	Oh, I love it, but my goodness golly does it add to the overall like
32279720	32282680	Duration of how long it takes to make an audio, but that's fine
32283160	32288520	Like if it's a passion project type thing just a small sting and my enemies would fall
32288920	32294840	Okay, we've just unlocked poison darts, which are fantastic. I'm a bit late to the story considering
32295800	32302600	Uh, actually we need to poison five guards in order to do a mission for not mission
32304440	32309400	Uh, you can like oh, he saw me. He saw me. Oh man. He caught me. Oh
32310280	32313320	Can you stop my good? I really wish
32315880	32318280	Oh, fine. We're just gonna grab his weapon. Oh
32319240	32323320	Well, we can also do that. I guess jeez. Let me heal up
32325800	32327800	What was my awakening
32328920	32333000	The jungle book muggle the snake scene in the jungle book
32333880	32336040	Which is terrible, but it's
32338920	32345240	I was just kind of like oh wait, wait, wait. Why did I really like this like really like this?
32345960	32347960	I
32350920	32352920	Right did I get more poison
32355400	32358760	I'm listening to stream. Anyways, luckily I had to open another tab where we got taken down, but
32359400	32364680	Uh, this and I got asleep. Yeah, please rest. Well, don't worry. Uh, I'm benchy. I don't know my
32365480	32369960	My streams are very long. It's quite hard to stay up unless you like wake up at the same time as me
32369960	32373400	Go to sleep at the same time as me. It's a bit hard for my endurance streams
32373400	32379240	But I don't always do endurance streams like I've got needy streamer overload that way a short one the hand cam stream will be a short one
32380680	32382120	Um
32382120	32385800	How many hours is this I've probably got like one more hour
32386760	32393160	I'm just gonna try and buy all the buildings and then tomorrow we can tackle the layer
32393640	32399320	Of romulus and I can show you the armor, which I really like we'll get a big armor upgrade
32400040	32402040	Um
32403320	32405800	And leonardo missions and then
32406840	32412280	We try and hundred percent the game for the dna sequence, which I'm very nervous about because I've never done it before
32412280	32418120	And someone said the tank mission and I was like the tank mission and they were like, yeah the tank mission
32418360	32420360	And now I am scared of the tank mission
32421720	32427000	Because I don't know what the hundred percent is on it and I'm terrified
32427240	32432920	Uh, I think I'm gonna poison those guards, which sounds really mean
32433880	32435880	Yeah
32435880	32438280	So is it more about being in controllers at more of a
32439000	32443000	Thing I definitely go both ways with my interest in hypnosis
32443720	32444840	um
32444840	32446840	I do like the idea of being like
32447400	32451640	It backfires. I really enjoy the idea of it backfire. We're just gonna
32457400	32459400	No
32466680	32471480	Okay, we did it we poisoned all those guards. Oh, they're beating each other up. Oh
32474200	32477720	Oh, they jump in him hydration check
32480280	32483720	You really like mirrors, huh backfire. Yes
32484360	32488840	Um, so I like the concept that my like hypnosis that I'm supposed to do on you
32489480	32494120	Um, like backfires on me like if I look at a shiny object or reflective objects
32495240	32497240	Like I like that that's
32499080	32503320	But I do like the idea of being in control and like
32504040	32507480	Telling you what to do because like that kind of power is
32508200	32511320	Like insane that power feels like
32514120	32518920	I know that's not even like a word or anything, but like it just feels very like
32520840	32522840	Hot in here
32522920	32525080	Because it's like, what do you mean I'm in control of you?
32526120	32528120	I'm just an echo
32530360	32533640	Oh, how the turntables basically I enjoy that too. Yeah
32535880	32537080	In
32537080	32541880	But I definitely need to do like more research like secret subject has been fantastic
32542360	32544920	If you didn't know like secret subject like has done
32545800	32547800	uh, like reports
32548200	32549880	and
32549880	32550920	and
32550920	32552680	like essays
32552680	32555480	and just like explains like stuff on
32557640	32560200	Oh, I don't have enough money
32562440	32564440	I spent it all
32564440	32569960	Goodness gracious, right hydration system secret subject mentioned. Yeah, I love secret subject

32977720	32983160	All the things I could do if I had a wee bit money
32984200	32986200	Must be funny
32986920	32988600	A little bit delirious
32988600	32989800	That's okay
32989800	32992520	Uh, right what we're doing four. Let's do four
32993480	32997560	You level up you guys because you guys are pretty weak sauce

33005400	33007400	For you
33010280	33012280	Right I like those odds
33015240	33017240	How did this turn into
33017400	33019400	Vantian business taken?
33019800	33022280	It's literally just like a side part of the game
33023160	33027800	Um, I just kind of like comes out and over honestly, uh, like send them all off
33028600	33031560	Money money money money money money money money
33046600	33048600	Okay, well just do that
33049400	33055480	For them. They're unfortunately a bit too weak. I'm just gonna safely send them all together
33055480	33059080	I don't want anyone to perish at this stage because everyone's getting pretty leveled up at this point
33059640	33065000	And uh, okay. I've got 12k for doing that. That's fantastic. Uh, right. Okay. We're gonna renovate this
33065080	33072360	We're gonna look at this view point. There's 24 view points in brotherhood and the borja tower's total
33072600	33074600	I believe is
33078200	33080200	10 no 12
33081560	33083960	Maybe 12 maybe 11
33084920	33088200	Mmm, so already 11 view points have been
33089960	33091960	Uh dealt with
33092600	33094600	Is this where I'm supposed to go?
33094600	33098680	Hello. Hello. Can I purchase you? I would like one courtesan tree
33100600	33105480	I do have the stamina to still be playing I love my video games and I love yapping
33106600	33108600	So I may or may not
33108760	33110760	Still be here
33111160	33116680	Um, I think I'll try and buy everything on the map and then once I've done that and
33117640	33119960	I think we'll retire for the evening
33121080	33123080	possibly
33123880	33127160	Or do we just go for it and send it? I don't know. How are we at?
33128120	33133960	We're at nine hours. So we technically have three hours before the vod starts
33135080	33138040	And feeling a bit special
33139000	33144840	So, I mean maybe my first game stream could be 12 hours
33147080	33150120	Hmm me honestly
33152200	33155000	Honestly for I'm feeling all right right now
33155800	33160280	Like I'm feeling out where the heck am I supposed to go? Am I supposed to do this thing? No, I'm not. Is that building?
33161560	33163560	um
33163560	33168200	Absolutely legendary feat. Oh, yeah, like I just love the game
33168520	33170520	Uh, obviously
33170520	33177320	The company of the reeflings make it absolutely fantastic being able to just blab about this game and
33177960	33182840	Ramble away about anything and everything. What the heck am I supposed to be doing here? I supposed to jump on the
33183320	33186440	That can be right up like this. No
33187400	33189400	Must be that one then
33190440	33192280	um
33192280	33195320	Okay, yeah, there we go. Um like
33197320	33200120	No, I won't say that that's not nice. That's not kind
33201640	33204120	Um 12 hours that's impressed. Yeah
33204760	33209400	Please understand if I hate the game I'm spending 12 hours on it
33210760	33215400	The fact that I have much stamina right now is because I absolutely adore this game
33215720	33218120	And I'm so glad I like get to share it with you
33218680	33221160	And just like show you everything about it like right now
33221160	33226840	We're playing landlord simulator on it you can do this as you progress through the campaign mode
33226920	33230760	But obviously we we finished the campaign mode. So never just don't landlord them
33231400	33233400	uh
33234920	33236920	Um, I don't know
33237640	33241480	If I maybe I could order some food
33243240	33245240	And then we take a break and I eat it
33245720	33247720	uh
33248200	33249320	Yeah
33249320	33252360	You got to do what you love reeflings Johnny loves brother
33253160	33258920	Oh, no if any of yousers stay enough. I'm so sorry. Yeah more content for eu frogs to just woke up
33259320	33264520	That is hilarious because someone was like are you gonna stream earlier to be eu friendly?
33265160	33268280	Um, and it's like well dependent on the game
33268760	33271800	I might be online when you wake up
33272360	33278920	Uh, so yeah, hi. Good morning. He you. How you doing?
33281480	33286360	Um, I wish youtube would fix the 12 hour
33287400	33289400	streaming vod issue
33290600	33291720	Um
33291720	33297480	If they did I honestly think I could do 14 hour streams like literally wake up
33298120	33304920	Very quickly, you know toilet brush teeth get some food ready. I think I could genuinely do that
33305880	33308680	Obviously my voice is croaking like a frog, but
33309800	33317240	I don't want to stop like I'm having a good time. I don't want a fun time for pause champ. That sounds bad for your health. I mean
33319240	33324440	I'm gonna say something controversial. I hope it doesn't come across like that, but for me
33325400	33329560	To talk and play video games. I don't
33330600	33335720	Feel I am over exerting myself as long as I have no current
33336360	33340760	issues going on such as illness dehydration possibly
33341560	33343560	um
33343800	33345320	Or
33345320	33351800	Other elements such as this that may prevent long-term streaming, but I am quite a happy bun
33352760	33354760	My blood flow is good. My heart
33355640	33357080	Is good to go
33357080	33358120	um
33358120	33363000	You know, I understand that some people may find it negative for their health to maybe
33364360	33368120	Not like sit and play games for 12 hours, but me
33369080	33374680	Of kinder I kind of done it for a long time like when I was um
33376040	33378040	When I was younger I
33378360	33383640	Had a rough time at high school. You know how it goes yawn yawn
33384440	33390680	um, and I very comfortably played xbox all day long. Um,
33391320	33394360	my parents were very understanding about my
33395240	33400280	situation as best as they could when it came to high school and um
33401000	33405160	Kind of not fitting in so I had a lot of days just to myself
33405960	33407960	Left of my own devices and
33408840	33415080	I used to just play xbox all day long and uh, yes, I'm very lucky to have the parents that I do
33415720	33417160	and
33417160	33419160	like I
33419160	33426360	hear stories of parents that don't quite understand like maybe what anxiety is or what
33427080	33429080	agoraphobia is or
33429720	33431240	kind of
33431240	33433240	these elements that may
33434200	33437160	Make up parts of your being and
33438200	33440200	kind of to have a parent who
33441080	33445400	Who loves you who loves you and but just unable to comprehend
33445960	33452200	How you are in the moment. It's rough and I do genuinely feel for you if you're in that situation
33452760	33458840	I hope that you feel comforted in the fact that like here you're accepted
33458920	33461400	You can be as autistic as you like, okay
33462360	33463800	and
33463800	33465800	you can
33465800	33471000	Just be yourself. I know you might worry about messages and oh my goodness. What does she think but
33472520	33478600	She thinks like herself, you know, I was in your shoes once most likely where
33479560	33486600	I was terrified of the world. I was terrified to leave my room. My life was in my room
33487480	33494120	Uh, and I was in my head and it's terrible when you're in your head. I wish I could pull you out instantly
33494280	33496280	I wish I could pull you out overnight
33496520	33500280	But guess what if watching my stream slowly pulls you out?
33501080	33503080	goodness gravy
33503560	33506040	Goodness gravy. Um, I am so
33506760	33510120	Lucky to be the one that can show you
33510920	33516040	That yes, the world is a scary place and guess what if your therapy is
33516760	33518760	some random scots
33519400	33523640	Playing the sassan's green brotherhood and nerdy now and then occasionally
33524120	33526120	It's throwing out a joke here and there
33527320	33529880	Let's get it. Let's get to it. You know
33531160	33533960	The world is our oyster. Okay
33536360	33537960	Like don't
33537960	33539560	Take your time
33539560	33540920	life
33540920	33545640	As they say Rome wasn't built in a day get it because we're in Rome. Huh, huh, huh?
33546440	33552280	And you know, you're not gonna figure out life in a day. Don't be silly. You're not gonna figure out in a week
33552280	33554840	You're not gonna figure it out in a month. You're not gonna figure it out
33555640	33562760	Until maybe you're even on the other side of it because how do you get life exp by living life?
33563720	33565720	okay
33566920	33568520	and
33568520	33574280	I think if you might be someone who struggles to go outside maybe at the moment or
33574840	33576840	with other areas
33577000	33579160	If you want to see it like a video game
33579160	33581800	It is the best way I could ever explain it
33582360	33586040	Is that you're always gaining exp every day. You might say to yourself
33586600	33592120	You know what? I'm just rotten in bed. I'm just watching streamers. I'm doing nothing. I'm not progressing
33593400	33598360	What if I told you that even though vtuber's may be entertainers
33599000	33601800	They can still teach you a thing or two about life like
33602600	33608600	Communicating with people or listening to people communicate and hearing their opinions
33609000	33613240	Giving you a new perspective on things you might never have considered before
33613800	33619240	Like please don't ever think you genuinely are stagnant and rotting
33619560	33624120	I know the terminology is rotten in bed and I've rotted all day. I've not done anything. I've did it
33624120	33625160	I did it
33625160	33627560	Well, I was told you you don't have to do anything
33628120	33630440	Who said you had to do anything like
33631160	33633160	Just
33633400	33640360	One breath at a time one day at a time you have come so far and you have
33641640	33643640	genuinely
33643800	33648680	Um, like gone through every worst day of your life and you're still here
33649080	33654840	You have no concept of how strong you are and like I'm like tearing up thinking about you. Oh my god
33655800	33657560	Like um
33657560	33660680	I'm happy to like share this like thing of the past, but
33661320	33663400	I was having a rough day. Um
33664360	33667400	And we listened to a song by mr. Kitty
33668040	33675000	And I said the phrase you feel like this all the time and like oh i'm actually crying

34435800	34437800	The layer of Romulus
34438360	34443160	First due to its easy nature in comparison to Leonardo's
34443880	34449000	Missions, we are not going to do Leonardo's. I think we might run out of time for Leonardo's mission
34450520	34454040	I want to say I think we will run out of time. Um
34455960	34457720	I will
34457720	34461560	Uh go for as long as I can though. Uh, I might call a water
34462200	34469160	Cola pee pee break and I am going to order some delivery food. Um, I'm not sure what I should order though
34471000	34477400	I want to say right. Okay. So I've had mcdonald's in america and I've had mcdonald's in scotland

34502120	34504120	intestines
34504920	34506920	They genuinely cannot handle
34508280	34512760	A maca's. I don't know if it's because they don't change the oil maybe. Um
34514120	34519080	Not beating the change of the oil accusations, but it's very plausible because yeah

34630360	34636840	Um, find someone you enjoy and not deviate from them. So the fact that you were willing to
34637800	34642280	Maybe deviate from who you consume. I appreciate that and I
34643080	34648280	Exchange my gratitudes and I'm very thankful you gave me a chance and I am glad I

34952600	34955160	Walk away type thing ready
34958760	34960760	Okay, there we go
34970520	34972760	You
35000520	35002520	Oh
35030520	35032520	You
35060520	35062520	You
35090520	35092520	You
35120520	35122520	You
35150520	35152520	You
35180520	35182520	You
35210520	35212520	You
35240520	35242520	You
35270920	35275720	You've been enjoying the background music of this game. It's goaded
35277400	35279400	It's goaded up all the time
35282840	35287160	Uh, it looks like we got one recruit back so far
35288440	35290440	We do have 10k. That's good money
35290760	35296200	I have water and I have a can of cola got better better fizzy juice
35296520	35301560	But if it's a juice for me, it's probably the worst thing I could do for my throat right now, but
35303400	35305400	Honestly, honestly
35306680	35308680	Does it even matter?
35310280	35315160	Like I can already feel I have nodules in my throat who cares it's too late. Leave me behind
35317320	35322920	Mmm, we do have very high. Okay. Yeah, levelly. He can just absolutely beast that
35323880	35326920	All right, let's go on business. What's your opinion on iron brew?
35327480	35333560	Did you know the most popular fizzy juice sold worldwide is cola?
35334200	35336040	except
35336040	35343080	For in scotland the only country where the number one sold fizzy juice is iron brew
35343400	35345400	And I do like iron brew. It's very good
35345960	35351400	Um, vim too is also very good if you have a uh, we're going this way. I remember now. Um
35353720	35358280	If you have fish and chips, vim too is very good for cutting the grease like
35358760	35362600	Sprite as well. It helps to cut the grease of your takeaway
35364360	35366360	Never had iron brew, but I want it
35368200	35372600	Um, if you are in australia, you can go to your willies
35373480	35376360	And they actually sell it in the british section
35377320	35384040	Unbelievably, it's at a premium rate, but make sure you refrigerate it iron brew should never be consumed at room temperature
35384120	35389640	Please do not do that to yourself and please understand. It is an acquired taste
35390360	35395480	But children of scotland were basically raised on neon orange
35396280	35397480	drink
35397480	35399480	So, yeah
35400280	35402280	Um
35403880	35411560	What does it taste like so iron brew themselves have said it's supposed to taste like ginger and bubblegum
35412120	35415240	It absolutely does not at all
35416120	35419240	taste like that i'm actually going to hire these because I need to do
35420600	35422120	distract
35422120	35424280	Um, it does not taste like this at all
35425000	35431400	I don't even I could not tell you anything remotely what it tastes like other than battery acid
35432920	35435960	Yeah, if you've ever smelled battery acid
35438120	35441960	Uh, that's what iron brew tastes like but like not bad
35442600	35444200	battery acid
35444200	35445880	You're still alive
35445880	35447800	Yes, sorry
35447800	35452840	We have finished the main campaign. We are currently renovating all of roma
35453400	35458840	We've started our serious landlord enterprise. It's going pretty well if I do say so myself
35460040	35462040	and
35462200	35464200	Willy Wonker and iron brew no
35467080	35469800	So basically mountain dew um
35472600	35475800	I did get an opportunity to taste mountain dew
35477000	35479000	I
35479000	35483240	Honestly wouldn't fault you. Yeah, I would say that's probably the closest ever
35483960	35488760	Taste you would get to iron brew, but it is still different. What are you mining?
35489560	35491560	Play minecraft out here
35492440	35497800	He's tilling the soil with a pickaxe. You're supposed to use a hole for tilling soil
35500040	35505480	Wait, are you beating the whole game? Uh, I have already done the campaign
35506360	35512280	Uh, like which means the story like chesery has been perished to fate itself because no man can murder me
35513240	35517800	We are now going through the map and renovate renovate and combine all the buildings
35518200	35523560	And then next we're going to do the layers of romulus which are these little wolf marks here
35524280	35528120	And if we have time we will do the leonardo missions
35529240	35534120	And the catarina missions and the auditory family missions
35535640	35540040	We are going to stop at the 12 hour mark very sadly
35540920	35543800	Not because I don't actually want to stream more
35544440	35548520	But because vods for some reason freak out
35549640	35556840	After the 12 hour mark and it is such a shame because if it didn't I think I could confidently
35557640	35559640	Finish all the mission
35561400	35563080	Which is a shame
35563080	35566520	Because definitely could do it if it wasn't for the
35568120	35572840	BOD issues so uh mercy is live right now. I am t-minus two hours
35573880	35575880	um
35576120	35578120	Start a new stream easy peasy
35579400	35588360	I am tempted however, um, there is a yumi plus member waiting on my side of an ace marco lab
35589000	35593800	And I don't want to leave her waiting. I also have to contact dempo fish
35594360	35596360	about the ace marco lab
35596680	35604200	Um, and I really don't want anyone to think I am taking their kindness and their time for granted
35604680	35606680	because on top of streaming
35606840	35613400	If someone comes to you asking for an ace marco lab and you do this and you do that like these girls are so hard working
35613960	35615000	and
35615000	35619560	I know some people might find streaming looks very easy on the surface
35619720	35625320	but people have lives and they have things going on and they have ailments and
35625960	35627640	They have family issues
35627640	35633000	They have they might even not even be able to stream as much as they like due to their living situation like
35633560	35637080	I just want to respect the time that I ask and
35637960	35641960	Give the girls like these ace marco labs like get it all sorted out and
35642360	35647880	Because if they've been kind enough to give me the time of day, I want to completely wholeheartedly respect that. Um
35649080	35651080	So hopefully tomorrow
35651880	35652840	um
35652840	35658840	Before I stream uh yumi will have a collab of me and her on her channel
35659320	35662440	If all goes well, sadly the ace mar
35663400	35670680	Memes for all violour members is paused right now until I know what's going on with monetization
35671480	35673480	and culling because
35675000	35677000	um
35677800	35679560	The memes are quite fun
35679560	35687400	But the nature of them depending on how mean youtube want to be recently with ace mar. It's quite uh nerve wracking
35688520	35690520	at the moment
35691240	35697400	Talking about ace mar. Did you give any of the girls advice for their first ace mar streams? Um only one girl
35697960	35699960	uh came to me for
35700440	35702120	Advice
35702120	35705080	I don't think she'd be embarrassed if I said um
35706360	35708360	Lovely azura has never
35709240	35714520	So she's she's never made ace mar herself. However, she has consumed the content
35715160	35716360	um
35716360	35718600	But because she's a yapper
35719240	35721720	She's like I can't really focus and know what to say
35722200	35728120	So I gave her a very small page of prompts that she can say just to help her out
35728680	35733160	So please do enjoy her ace mar stream when she does it to the full extent
35733880	35734920	um
35734920	35739720	Because she's just very lovely. Um, I think she's just a wee bit
35740360	35743800	Unconfident, but I am sure with the love she gets from
35744680	35747960	Her bleeding hearts. I don't know if bleeding hearts is getting changed
35748440	35751480	But the love that you guys will show will instill
35752120	35755880	The confidence that I know she will have one day
35756840	35761720	And you know doing this and uh, yeah, as I said, I've got faith in it
35763000	35766680	Gonna have to try and someplace around here that sells. I'm bro. My interest has me peaked
35768120	35769800	Willys
35769800	35775640	Willys go to the british section or the indian section at willys. I kid you not. They're at the same section
35777720	35778760	Um
35778760	35781400	We'll take great care of mama as yes
35782360	35788920	Um, she is very caring naturally like I kid you not like it's not a role play
35789480	35792360	Like she is very caring naturally
35793080	35794760	um
35794760	35799560	And as her confidence grows, I think it'll very it will come across
35800440	35806120	Um, and I'm just very excited to watch her blossom as a streamer because
35807800	35809800	She she's just
35810760	35812760	She's being propelled
35813080	35815800	Not into a new world. She has had very
35817000	35825000	Long history of streaming, but she's definitely been propelled. I think is the fair word to say and um
35825640	35833000	You know, she's trying out new things and I'm I'm absolutely I'm all for I I hope um, she feels
35833880	35837800	Able to reach out to me as I said with all the girls they have reached out to me at one point
35837880	35845320	And you know, I advise the best I can but the true fact of the day is all the girls have more streaming experience than me
35845800	35846840	so
35846840	35848840	There's like only
35848920	35850920	So much value to my words
35851480	35853480	and it's like
35853560	35855160	my darlin
35855160	35862520	My darlin, I love you, but I can't give you advice on this because the fact of the matter is you're more experienced than me
35863320	35870680	And like it's okay to experiment. It's okay to find figure things out. Um, it's okay to do these things
35871480	35878440	Um, I think we've fully renovated everything but this missed aqueduct possibly uh other than the
35880280	35887160	Location so I think we'll actually do a layer of romuli. Uh, there's one down here. So we'll do this one first
35887560	35891800	My darlin. Yes, like I'm kind of like my darlin
35893080	35897240	There is a point, uh, which pains me to admit but
35898360	35901240	There's a point where I'm of no use to you
35902040	35906280	Um, there's only so much my knowledge so far goes
35906280	35910680	Like I definitely have knowledge of the ASMR side of things audio roleplay side of things
35911320	35913320	But stream advice
35914120	35920040	Uh, my stream advice is I've just done what I want and it worked out
35920600	35925960	And the truth of that fact is that is not how it works for everyone
35926600	35933640	And it's just not possible and it is not responsible either for me to give streaming advice
35934520	35936120	like that
35936120	35940680	Knowing full well, that's not how it works for everyone and I think it's um
35941160	35945640	Um, I think it's perfectly okay to admit um
35946840	35953240	I'm sorry, but I'm not knowledgeable enough. I can come up with fun stream ideas. I can come up with fun collab ideas
35953240	35955400	I can come up with fun event ideas
35956120	35958280	But to actually sit on stream
35959160	35961880	I'm not the streamer. You're the streamer
35962840	35964600	You know
35964600	35966600	And uh, I have full faith
35966680	35969640	They will do make they will do nothing
35970280	35976520	Less than make me proud. Do nothing but make me proud. Yeah, do nothing but make me proud
35977080	35981720	Um, not that it's their responsibility to prove themselves to me
35982680	35988280	Because they proved themselves to me long ago. I saw myself in them and uh
35989000	35996440	Different ways for me. I saw the shitposting side of me for she be I saw the side of me that
35997320	36003640	Literally just needed a hand up. That's all I needed. She be as fully stacked to go. She just needed a hand up
36004200	36007400	Um, Azura just needed a chance. Um
36008600	36010600	mercedes
36010680	36015160	Determination that her unending unending stamina
36015960	36017240	um
36017240	36022920	And I say her experience to hone her craft like I see
36023640	36025640	myself in these little
36026040	36027640	little
36027640	36028840	parts
36028840	36030840	Which made it so easy
36032040	36037080	to relate to the girls to have trust in the girls to have faith in the girls and
36037880	36039000	um
36039000	36041000	That's just the fact of the matter
36041640	36043000	um
36043000	36050200	And all of them have so much potential and I really hope that viola gives them
36051240	36053240	that opportunity
36053320	36054360	to
36054360	36058920	Bring themselves to the next level and achieve what their dreams are
36059560	36065560	When it comes to being a content creator a streamer oopsies ran off the wall. Um
36067640	36069640	And yeah
36070680	36072680	That's that's just me
36074040	36078280	I'm just so happy. Uh, yes, this looks like I'm going around in circles
36079160	36083480	It's part of the map. Um, so this is before yellow paint is a thing
36084200	36090200	Uh, because Assassin's Creed use torches for these parts of the chambers if you go the wrong way
36090680	36092360	Then you're just going to get money
36092360	36098840	Which is fine if you want to collect boxes. There are flags as well, but we're not doing the flags just yet
36098840	36100840	We're doing that tomorrow
36101240	36103240	But for now
36104120	36106120	Did I need to go that way?
36107080	36111480	Mom me what scrawny sounds like a mom gasping up her kids
36112600	36114280	honestly though
36114280	36120680	Like I didn't really know what to expect them to like call me and stuff and they all call me mom
36122520	36124520	Which I adore um
36125640	36128120	And they're all like, oh, I love you scrawny and I'm like, oh
36128440	36133560	We're passing around the L word and I'm like, oh because like I didn't want to be the first one to say that
36134440	36135560	But like
36135560	36137560	I love you too. Like my god
36137640	36138920	thank you for like
36138920	36144680	believing in me and seeing the goal and and believing in yourself to like reach out and grab it
36145400	36152280	um, if you've ever kind of looked around on vtuber applications like applications open now
36152840	36156360	the most common tweet under these things is
36157160	36163400	Like I am not confident enough to go out and reach for this and it is such
36163960	36165240	a shame
36165240	36171080	Because truly it is you miss a hundred percent of the things you don't go for and like it's just
36171800	36173800	I almost fell down. Um
36174200	36176200	it's just like such a shame
36176360	36177480	but
36177480	36185320	like good on the girls for reaching out and basically letting me grab their hand like thank you for
36185880	36187880	letting me do that for you. Um
36188520	36189480	type thing
36189480	36193480	Like thank you for enabling yourself to enable me. It's what I'm trying to say
36195080	36199560	I like your stamina. I wasn't expecting it. You should see me in the bedroom. Sorry. I was just
36200440	36202440	I'm sorry. I apologize
36204040	36206040	She's still streaming. Yes or e
36206600	36211960	Finish the campaign. We're now doing layers of Romulus which unblocks the special armor
36212600	36216680	Sorry, it was too easy. It was too easy. You made it so easy
36219320	36221320	I just checked
36222440	36224440	Oh
36226600	36232840	Opsies, I just realized this is not a jump down and I realized the second I launched at that skeleton
36234200	36235400	You can
36235400	36237880	Drop and grab at these sections
36237960	36242600	I really do not like dropping and grabbing because it's kind of hard to judge where you're to go next
36243000	36245000	um
36245400	36246840	However
36246840	36249880	The camera does assist you mildly
36250840	36255320	And it's a bit of a really do you have to do it like that? But yeah
36259480	36261320	Yeah
36261320	36263320	Aren't you a quick show though?
36263640	36265400	You shut the hell up
36265400	36267400	You freaking freaks
36267480	36270760	I tell you that in confidence and you throw it on my face
36273240	36275240	I'm trying to remember which one this is again
36275320	36279080	Just follow the light if you ever get confused at the section of the game
36279640	36287560	Uh the game when you're in catacomb like levels the game will unironically light the way to tell you where to go
36288200	36291960	Again, we're getting teased by that flag, but we don't why did you not grab that?
36292520	36294520	Is anyone supposed to go there?
36295080	36301240	Am I not supposed to go there? No, I'm supposed to go there. It's you. You're teasing me
36301960	36307560	Such a naughty naughty. It's you grab the ledge. Yeah, so you were supposed to grab it
36309720	36313880	I've never played assassin you bought games, but haven't played them
36315960	36317960	Hey, it's all
36318280	36324200	Um, maybe you work a lot and you think the game looks good and then you say to yourself
36324280	36329160	I'll play it when I'm not tired, but then after work you're like man. I'm exhausted
36329240	36331480	I don't really feel like playing a new game
36332040	36337320	And then you feel like playing games that you're familiar with and that is the power of nostalgia
36339400	36341400	Very powerful drug
36341960	36345720	And that is why media today is regurgitated a lot
36346680	36351880	Because of the power of nostalgia unironically, that's why they have Beal just who coming out
36358440	36361160	It's really interesting learning about marketing trends as well
36363160	36365720	Hmm, maybe we could do a business
36366440	36372280	Analysing stream. I wouldn't mind yapping about that. I wouldn't mind yapping about biology as well. Um
36373240	36375240	I wanted to test an
36377080	36379080	Educational stream
36379640	36381320	um
36381320	36384040	I thought we could do a
36385400	36387400	Full stream day
36388120	36392120	And it's like literally like a full day at school again
36392920	36394760	and
36394760	36398680	Because I would be like, okay, we're doing English and then we're gonna like
36399560	36404680	And like I'm gonna wait unironically. I'm gonna ask questions and I'm gonna wait until someone gets it right
36406440	36408680	Who the heck just rated it in me
36409640	36415960	Rhea, how dare you Rhea? Hi Rhea. How was your stream? Hopefully I'm saying your name right. I apologize
36416520	36418520	But hi

36446040	36451960	Um, what were you playing or were you yapping? Were you speaking Japanese on on stream?
36454840	36461160	Although you're probably exhausted after stream to be honest, you're like, please strongy. Don't ask me any questions. I'm exhausted
36461720	36463720	That's fair. That's fair
36464200	36468840	Uh, we are playing uh, Assassin's Creed brotherhood
36469240	36474600	Uh, and we're doing the catacombs which have been lighted lighted the path that they have been lit
36475320	36477320	Um, and it tells us where to go
36481080	36484040	Strongies 365 so in Scottish, but it's actually
36485960	36487480	Yeah
36487480	36492360	Um, but yes, thank you so much for reading to me. I appreciate that. Please relax and rest well after stream
36492920	36495720	Uh, you've done a fantastic job pat yourself on the back
36496600	36502120	And for the jokes, uh, my name is strongy culls. I am part of valour
36503080	36505080	Umie plus were absolutely
36505480	36509560	Lovely and did a watch along of our debuts. We are incredible new
36510040	36515960	Um, and I am strongy the scottish cuttlefish. I am an endurance streamer and today we are playing
36516760	36522840	Assassin's Creed brotherhood. We have completed the storyline the main quest line the campaign
36523480	36527960	Uh, and we are currently doing what's known as the lair of romulus
36528680	36531320	I just got stabbed if you saw that by throwing now
36531880	36534520	Uh, um, unfortunately the camera angles are a bit
36535320	36542120	However, uh, the games have held up quite well to the test of time because Assassin's Creed brotherhood was developed in
36542840	36543880	no
36543880	36545880	was released in
36546440	36548440	2010
36548760	36550760	um, and
36550840	36552840	um
36552920	36558440	It's a childhood game of mine. So I'm very happy to play it for a very long time. I'm just waiting for the sky to attack me
36558680	36560680	Apologies get a little distracted there
36562280	36564280	Okay, he just fell to his death
36565800	36567800	Hey, yeah
36569240	36574920	So development most likely was 2007, which is crazy to think about
36575560	36577880	Although it might have been on the back of
36578120	36583400	Assassin's Creed 2. I would 100% believe it was off the back of Assassin's Creed 2
36584360	36587160	Um, all things considered because brotherhood
36588120	36590120	Definitely. Oh, I'm tamed
36591720	36597400	I just I have seven seconds to complete the memory. Yeah. Good luck with that. We'll be replaying this one
36597640	36600360	I didn't realize I got tamed on the other ones as well
36602040	36604920	Filling me. Okay. Well, he just dodged that
36605720	36609960	Uh, can you maybe attack him? Gee, Louise
36612280	36617080	Oh my god, that was brutal. I just took his weapon from him and then uh ended him with that weapon
36619160	36621160	Rather brutal, but I'll take it
36622440	36624440	Restart time
36625640	36628520	We will rock you
36628680	36630680	Do
36631000	36633000	None of you are a big boy
36636760	36640760	You got mud on your face. Yeah, wait
36641880	36647640	No, I was so close to being the tame. I didn't know I was deli dalyan
36649160	36654520	I was deli dalyan so I didn't get 100% I can't believe it. I can't believe yapping has cost me 100%
36655000	36660280	Oh, no, it results in me having to stream more. Oh, what a punishment
36661320	36664120	We actually will open the chest because we're a bit low on funds
36666680	36671080	Yeah, I saw you at the beginning last night and now in the morning you're still here. Good job. Thank you
36671400	36673240	We finished the campaign
36673240	36677400	Doing layers of romuli. We're going to unlock the special armor in this game
36678280	36681320	Uh, not much treasures in these chests
36682280	36688200	So close and yet so far such a fake assassin's creed. I know I'm actually an assassin's creed fake fanboy
36693160	36695160	Oh, I can't believe it
36696600	36698440	I can't believe I missed that by a ball here
36698920	36704040	So say you missed something very closely in scots you say by a ball here
36704120	36708120	Which means exactly what you think it is by a ball here because of how short they are
36708920	36710920	So I missed it by a ball here
36712680	36715800	Angie, Angie, take a sip. Please remember to hydrate
36718680	36720280	Wow
36720280	36727960	That cola is chris b is exactly what one I wanted my good morning burp so bad on his floor
36730360	36733080	Imagine burping me after every time like
36734040	36737560	Like patting my back. Wait, where the heck are we? We didn't start in here
36738280	36743640	No, we were down here and now we're here. Okay. Are we closer to another layer?
36744280	36747160	That is where we get the treasure
36748200	36751960	There's one to the east. Okay. We will head east
36753080	36758520	Never eat shredded wheat is how you remember your north east south west
36760200	36764360	I won't lie. I've been studying a wikipedia list of scottish slang
36765080	36769560	Oh, there's so much but a lot of scottish slang isn't
36770600	36772200	used
36772200	36774200	So you might be studying
36775080	36777640	Too hard for the test that doesn't exist yet
36780120	36782120	But I do appreciate it
36782360	36787960	Uh, I do apologize for those of you whose english is not your first language
36788920	36795960	I can be a bit mumbly and hard to understand but I do try my best to enunciate words on stream
36797080	36799640	Just because my natural speaking voice
36800440	36803480	I kind of sound more like this and a bit more monotone
36804360	36808920	And it's no that i'm no interested or i'm disinterested but
36809640	36814040	I just kind of sound a bit more like this and it doesn't really sound that exciting
36814920	36817160	But it's not because i'm not having a good time
36817880	36820040	It's because i'm a mumbly
36820600	36823160	Bampot and I know i'm a mumbly bampot
36823960	36825960	So i'm undoing that treat
36827720	36829720	On the music the music is going to do the
36834440	36838120	Glorious soundtrack glorious soundtrack
36839240	36841720	I cannot recall of sassans 3 2
36842680	36844680	Uh, it's you it's the lever
36845960	36847960	Is it is it being pulled?

36864120	36866120	And it's totally not
36866600	36873000	Uh, a capitalist ploy to get you to visit that location and support the
36873720	36877640	Piring a boat and buying drinks at that location. It's not a ploy
36878680	36880680	Nessie is real
36880680	36881800	and
36881800	36884280	Spend your hard-earned tourist money on us. Thank you

37450120	37456920	I can't wait for azerah ASMR. Thankfully, uh, I'm pretty sure I can vouch for your pc azerah and say it's not going to explode
37457400	37461160	Uh, when you do ASMR because it's just you and the microphone
37461400	37463400	Um
37464120	37468040	We can give you white noise plugins as well if you would like to use that or if you want to just
37468680	37472840	ASMR stream is ASMR up to me. I wish I was that pc right now for a throw
37475400	37479560	We had fun chan. Oh, did you end up doing that too talking stream?
37481400	37484280	Where do I go from here down? Oh looks like I go down
37485640	37490840	Oh, did the gate open? Sorry. I'm too busy yapping the gate. Yeah, okay. That's swung open. Look at that
37492120	37498840	Oh, it's even got the sound effects. You know, this area is given Elden Ring. I said it
37499640	37506360	What do you mean that any sort of medieval esk type build is like Elden Ring?
37507160	37510600	I can't believe it the Elden Ring allegations
37511000	37512200	No, what was it?
37512200	37516040	What was the meme game where everyone was like this game's just like oh dark souls
37516120	37520680	That's it. This game's just like the did it is it of dark souls this game's like the did it did it of dark
37521720	37524200	I almost jumped down. Oh, thank god. I saw the ladder anyway
37525320	37528440	Yeah, I just talked afterwards. So it was yappy. Oh, that's good
37530120	37531880	Yes
37531880	37539000	Okay, we have collected the third scroll of Romulus only three more to go even though that says number five
37539080	37541720	So I'm doing it in the wrong order. I didn't know there was an order. I apologize
37542600	37546600	I thought the game kind of automatically like gave you this number that number
37547640	37550280	I'm not going to bother with the treasure chest because it was just so little
37553880	37555080	Wow
37555080	37557080	Have a little separatism
37557400	37563240	Gamers will see a Scottish castle and be like dark souls in real life. Can I tell you the dumbest thing ever?
37564440	37566440	One man wreck in Korea. That's a good thing
37567160	37568760	um
37568760	37574360	Was it modern warfare had a map based in scotland like that castle map?
37575320	37576280	um
37576280	37583560	In my dumb ass played it and I was like, this is so weird. This map feels so Scottish
37584040	37586840	and it was based after scotland and
37587320	37590280	Yeah, it didn't click until like after I looked it up
37591880	37597480	But I was like this feels so weird. It feels so Scottish. Why like why would they do that?
37597480	37602120	And I was like, oh, it's because it's based after gotland and castle and stuff. Yeah
37603240	37609080	Not very smart am I but yeah, I didn't I couldn't name the map out. I'd know it wasn't a black ops map
37610200	37614040	Because I pretty much know all the black ops map names, which is really sad
37614200	37620520	But is it sad if you enjoyed yourself? Is it sad? Oh, wow the bank has 31,000 in it
37622200	37624200	Hmm
37625160	37627960	Where's this Romulae? Is there a bank before it?
37629080	37633080	Ah, there isn't a bank right? We'll go back and pick up our money and then
37633960	37635960	we'll go
37637320	37641400	He'd been college at ghost plausible. I did play ghost
37642600	37644600	Very plausible. I shan't deny
37644600	37648520	I'll send my assassins away again because there's no point in having the assassins hanging around
37648920	37653960	When they could go be making like money and XP have we got another level eight? Yes, we do
37654920	37661400	We've got two three level eight four level eight. So that's fantastic. Okay. The assassins are definitely
37662200	37663960	getting very
37663960	37666120	potent now. They are getting very
37666760	37668760	Deadly which I'm quite happy with
37670200	37672680	Stonehaven that sounds like it
37673560	37675560	Yeah, me be me
37675720	37684920	Very dumb and be like, hmm. You feel you feel so familiar. I wonder why I just can't I just can't put my tongue on my
37685800	37688040	Uh, brain on why it feels so familiar
37690360	37692840	I'm a dumb dumb, but that's okay
37694520	37696520	I'm allowed to be a dumb dumb
37697480	37699480	Dum dum you give me gum gum
37699960	37704040	Oh, we're gonna watch night at the museum. I've not seen it since a child
37704120	37709400	So I'm gonna be laughing my buttocks off. I think watching that maybe
37711160	37713160	Maybe they do
37715160	37717160	Man no problem
37719720	37723880	Yeah, the map was every sniper heaven at heaven
37724600	37726600	On sniper heaven. Yeah
37727720	37730440	Wait, no, I need the money out of the bank. Goodness me. I'm getting distracted
37731400	37733400	silly silly
37734120	37739080	I learned once and I learned only recently that night at the museum had sequels
37740360	37742360	I don't
37743800	37746840	No, if I remember sequels
37747400	37749400	Hmm

37927000	37931400	This is the part where the rat breaks down. No one moves. No one makes a sound
37933800	37935800	Back from reality. They go grab it
37936760	37938760	I
37941600	37945640	Hate I hate tailing missions when they can attack me. I'm so sorry. I get so stressed
37947800	37951880	Yes, yes, yes Romulus commands the death of xy wild atory. Good luck for that mate
37953160	37955160	Get your wee knife out
37955720	37957720	And then wait for them to attack you
37958360	37960840	And then just chain attack whoever goes up
37961400	37963400	White is going to attack you next
37963400	37968900	You can lock on to them first, or you can counter as they do it.
37970100	37970900	No hit.
37976400	37982400	Yes, okay, I understand now why the 100% was don't lose health squares, because these are a lot.
37984900	37988400	Just wait for them to attack, and then counter, and then just go for it.
37989400	37994400	And then we need to run because it's a chase mission.
37995700	37998400	Well how do I do it? I'm just going for it.
37998400	38000700	Oh that was lucky I even hit that.
38001400	38005400	Please don't hurt me. I would like to get this 100%, so I don't have to play this one next.
38006400	38009400	Oh, he injured me. Oh they're jumping me, there's somebody.
38009400	38011400	Stop it, stop it, stop it.

38025420	38026920	But how do clips work on YouTube?
38026920	38035740	So if you clicked me, I can see what you clipped and then send it to an editor.
38035740	38036740	Basically.
38036740	38041040	There was the possibility of submitting clips on the Discord.
38041040	38045920	But then people would have to have speed peaking permissions.
38045920	38047480	Woo!
38047480	38049200	Oh, I'm not ready.
38049200	38050320	Oh, they're jumping me!
38050320	38052160	Oh, that was like insane reaction.
38052160	38055920	I just select the attack option in order to counter that.
38057800	38059960	Oh, I had a little mini heart, right?
38059960	38062840	I struggle with this area to know where to go next.
38062840	38065760	I assume this little lamp is telling.
38065760	38066760	Yeah, okay.
38066760	38069680	This little light of mine.
38069680	38072480	I'm going to let it show.
38072480	38075880	Please don't leave my health bars.
38075880	38076760	I'm jumping them.
38076760	38079160	I'm just, yeah, yeah, yeah.
38079160	38080280	Oh, you can't see me?
38080280	38081200	I can see.
38081200	38082640	Can you get your gun out?
38082640	38083560	Oh, I can see you.
38083560	38085480	Get wrecked.
38085480	38086800	Right, where am I going?
38086800	38089080	Actually, let me get my wee knife out again.
38089080	38091240	If it's all going to be wolves, there's
38091240	38093880	no point in no having.
38093880	38095600	I'm just going to get this real quick.
38095600	38097600	Don't mind anybody.
38097600	38098840	You're still going strong, eh?
38098840	38099680	Yes, sir.
38103280	38104960	Oh, there, hey, see that flag?
38104960	38105840	We're going to get it.
38105840	38108760	I'm getting up for the head of the event.
38108760	38113680	I wish you could climb in this little hole, but you can.
38113680	38115560	Pardon me, I'm sorry.
38115560	38118680	For being so rude, it wasn't me, it wasn't my food.
38118680	38120240	I say that as I've happened.
38120240	38122600	Right, remit.
38122600	38125240	Jesus, did not let me select a small knife there.
38125400	38128000	Wait for them to attack, and boom.
38128000	38128760	You just can't attack.
38128760	38132880	Boom, boom, oh, I'm getting, oh, they're jumping up.
38132880	38134880	And then boom.
38134880	38136840	And yeah, they're guarding.
38136840	38137960	That's fine.
38137960	38140640	We are going to do crossbow bolts.
38140640	38142200	Until they get too close, my goodness,
38142200	38143360	they get close fast.
38143360	38145200	Yeah, OK, OK.
38145200	38147520	Well, what are you aiming at, SAO darling?
38147520	38149600	Darling, they're in front of you.
38149600	38151560	And I don't want to replay the section
38151560	38153040	if I can get 100% first time.
38153040	38154280	Thank you.
38154280	38157200	Thank you, Etsy.
38157200	38158360	Thank you.
38158360	38161920	By the way, are you going to be playing Silent Hill?
38161920	38164760	I am very sorry for those of you who
38164760	38167640	might be interested in me playing Silent Hill.
38167640	38171000	I'm under the impression Silent Hill
38171000	38175000	are those games where you can't.
38175000	38179440	Oh, that was really rude, and I don't appreciate that.
38179440	38181160	Don't do that again.
38181160	38183120	You've literally just put me in the water,
38183160	38186000	and now my robes are drenched.
38186000	38188040	Oh, I really don't want to desync.
38188040	38191280	I think I still keep 100%, even if I desync,
38191280	38194520	from trail distance.
38194520	38195840	Oh, see, that's the problem.
38195840	38198320	They instantly throw a knife.
38198320	38199680	Bit of a problem.
38199680	38201960	Bit of a problem.
38201960	38206360	My goodness, they are on me.
38206360	38208880	Oh, that's not good.
38208880	38211160	Oh, that's not good.
38211160	38212360	I think I'm OK.
38213360	38216160	Oh, not good, not good, not good, not good, not good, not good.
38216160	38219960	If you get knocked off, they can just spam throwing knives,
38219960	38221960	essentially, just like what they're doing right now,
38221960	38224360	but I think we're OK.
38224360	38228560	Oh, oh, OK, we're good.
38228560	38229640	We're good, we're good.
38229640	38233200	Landed, literally landed in the water.
38233200	38236680	Oh, goodness me.
38236680	38237520	Give this to me.
38237560	38241520	Me, I think we're on this last section
38241520	38245280	of being able to be vulnerable.
38245280	38249280	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
38249280	38254480	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
38254480	38255680	You're going to have to attack me.
38255680	38256180	Ah!
38261160	38263880	OK, that's fine, that's fine, let me cook you.
38263880	38266000	Oh, see that, that's throwing knife.
38266040	38269480	I don't know how to counter-throw a knife if you even can.
38269480	38271880	Like other than, like, move a little to the left,
38271880	38275680	so Tanzu's ult just moved to the left five head.
38275680	38277800	I actually don't know if there's a counter-throw.
38281080	38282960	Would you like to send any more?
38285920	38287360	Fight me yourself.
38287360	38291160	It is you who tell the people lies.
38291160	38293360	Tell them lies.
38293360	38295760	Give me the code sheet.
38295760	38298040	All I will give you is death.
38298040	38298840	Really?
38298840	38304360	There's 20 dead bodies, and you think you can perish me?
38304360	38305560	Good luck, mate, good luck.
38305560	38307640	I'd like to see you try.
38307640	38309960	Oh, oh, OK, we doing this?
38309960	38311480	If you're just going to counter me,
38311480	38314680	you're getting kicked to death.
38314680	38316000	I ain't tolerating this.
38316000	38318080	If you won't let me stab stab you,
38318080	38319480	you're just getting kicked to death.
38319480	38322160	There is no other option.
38322160	38323400	I will put you in a circle, I'll
38323400	38324800	hoof you in the balls until you're dead.
38324800	38327520	Literally exploded your testes.
38327520	38329400	I'm sorry to even put that thought in your head.
38329400	38331480	I apologize.
38331480	38333480	There is a flag over here.
38333480	38336360	Do you want to know how to access it?
38336360	38341160	You go for a little dive, and it's that simple.
38341160	38343200	Why do I say it's that simple?
38343200	38346200	I may or may not have got that flag
38346200	38348520	after crying for 20 minutes.
38348520	38352400	I'm trying to find it, and I'm pulling my hair out.
38352440	38355920	I break his chances of ever having children now.
38355920	38361080	I believe that's all in this room.
38361080	38365240	I see a climbing thing up here, but I'm not sure.
38365240	38367080	Oh, that's how you actually progress.
38367080	38367920	My pardon.
38367920	38368920	Your pardon, I beg.
38372360	38374880	You used your cuttlefish powers to dive.
38374880	38377160	Yeah.
38377160	38379000	I cast mulch.
38379040	38383600	I think mulch is still my favorite cast.
38383600	38386080	I don't know if there's anything that beats it at the moment.
38394000	38395960	We are now four of six.
38395960	38398160	We are very close to unlocking the armor.
38398160	38399040	What are we looking at?
38399040	38402960	Oh, the clock is ticking for this mod.
38402960	38404320	I shouldn't have looked at the time.
38409360	38410640	I'm getting nervous.
38410640	38412600	I don't want to get too close to the hell forever.
38412600	38416280	I don't want it to explode in a fire for my vod.
38420160	38424400	Nice money for doing the side quests.
38424400	38430400	We're at 49 Florence, so we can probably invest in some,
38430400	38433960	how you call, tourist attractions.
38433960	38435840	I can't remember what their official name is.
38435840	38437960	I think they just get named by what they actually are,
38437960	38446080	because they are from the Oracle buildings and locations.
38446080	38447880	I can't remember even.
38447880	38452120	My cast is still streaming strong, hey, yeah.
38452120	38453600	So I was like, go to bed.
38453600	38455680	Oh, don't you worry.
38455680	38457680	Oh, shit.
38457680	38458920	That's just inhaled my spit.
38468920	38469880	Pardon me.
38469880	38472520	I didn't mean to cough.
38472520	38475080	OK, Romulai, Romulai, Romulai.
38478080	38478720	Can I see it?
38481560	38482480	There's one here.
38482480	38483680	That's quite far away, though.
38486240	38488320	Oh, there's one in the Colosseum.
38488320	38489080	I never saw that.
38489080	38490560	OK, we're going to do this one up here.
38493760	38496680	Obviously, your successor is going to still go in.
38496680	38501800	You never met a girl with such stamina before, huh?
38501800	38503600	It's a pleasure to be your first.
38503600	38506320	I can't set the bow.
38506320	38509160	I wasn't kidding when I said I'm an endurance streamer.
38509160	38512920	As long as my voice doesn't crack and I lose it,
38512920	38514480	I'm happy to stream long.
38514480	38517440	No, obviously, it does depend on the game.
38517440	38519840	If it's a game I don't like, then, yeah,
38519840	38522840	definitely do not expect me to be on 12 hours for the game.
38522840	38525680	But yeah.
38525720	38527320	What's that supposed to mean?
38530080	38532640	This is the longest a streamer has lasted for me.
38532640	38533920	Wait, seriously?
38533920	38537320	I'm breaking your first-time records?
38540080	38540560	Will?
38543760	38544720	I love long streams.
38544720	38545320	It's so nice.
38545320	38547000	Ah, I'm glad I can keep you company.
38547000	38549160	Whether you're at work or you're bing-chinging, don't show
38549160	38549800	me.
38549800	38551880	Bing-chinging.
38551880	38555480	I'm glad I can keep you company.
38555520	38557840	My record is like a one and a half.
38557840	38560840	Wait, of someone streaming?
38560840	38561800	No.
38561800	38563880	You mean how long you've watched a streamer
38563880	38566800	when you say that?
38566800	38569600	I mean, have you ever watched a streamer that's
38569600	38574200	streamed more than like, what's the average stream time
38574200	38576440	for a VTuber?
38576440	38579280	Oh, that would be an interesting statistic.
38579360	38586880	Average stream time for a VTuber is three hours?
38586880	38587880	Two hours?
38591160	38593520	I called in sick to have time to watch streams and catch up
38593520	38595120	and go, stop.
38595120	38597320	You're going to get in trouble doing that.
38597320	38600920	You can't do that.
38600920	38603360	Don't get yourself in trouble at work.
38606080	38607800	The votes are always here.
38607800	38613040	And I plan on streaming for a long time.
38613040	38616360	My biggest concern, I'm happy to talk about this concern.
38616360	38620440	My biggest concern with streaming was I wouldn't have
38620440	38624640	time to stream and technically manage.
38624640	38630840	But I've managed to get a script manager in place, which
38630840	38635200	means that my only responsibilities are
38635200	38637840	streaming for myself and arranging
38637840	38642480	shorts for the girls to make, like,
38642480	38644800	Mercy's shorts that have been coming out.
38644800	38647760	I scripted them and got her to say them.
38647760	38652320	And I don't know if you enjoyed her blonde one.
38652320	38655320	Obviously, Mercy couldn't suggest talking
38655320	38657360	about behind the scenes content.
38657360	38661080	I gave her the script, she made it.
38661080	38662920	And then I got someone to edit it type thing.
38662920	38665080	That's my only responsibility is, like,
38665080	38667680	organizing clips, basically, that go up in the girls'
38667680	38670400	channels, because I didn't want them to feel stressed out
38670400	38672400	dealing with that kind of stuff.
38672400	38683040	The only problem is I'm facing the issue of clipped parts
38683040	38686480	of stream turning into shorts.
38686480	38690320	Because obviously, I don't have time to scrub through
38690320	38693800	their content in order to find, like, a funny thing.
38693800	38699040	So when you clip a girl's, one of the girls' streams, on the
38699040	38701880	account, I can see what people have clipped.
38701880	38703920	And then I can send that to an editor.
38703920	38708000	So don't be afraid to clip something you like.
38708000	38710400	Because on my end, I can see that.
38710400	38713560	And then I can send it on to an actual creator of the
38713560	38716360	clips, like, for a short.
38716360	38717920	Did you see that?
38717920	38721480	So I can get away with that stuff.
38721480	38722960	Yeah, that's the only thing.
38722960	38727360	I think your personal best is back-to-back 12-hour of odds.
38727360	38729880	Yes.
38729880	38735080	We're probably going to do it again when the DLC comes out.
38735080	38738120	I'm not sure if we'll do the Butt-Bump adventure for that
38738120	38741400	part, though.
38741400	38742080	I know it.
38742080	38743520	Wait, what was my 100%?
38743520	38744680	I wasn't paying.
38745440	38747480	Not another timed one.
38747480	38749360	Stinky.
38749360	38750640	I'm not going to rush it.
38750640	38754000	I'm just going to go through it, so I know what we're
38754000	38755000	looking at.
38758320	38760640	Ooh, I remember this one.
38760640	38764960	I have desynced DLC, downloadable content.
38764960	38770240	The video game Elden Ring has official DLC coming out on
38770240	38773000	June 19, I believe.
38773000	38776960	And I plan on doing it multiplayer with you guys, so
38776960	38780880	I will put down marks where, what the heck?
38780880	38782360	What am I supposed to do?
38785640	38790160	Unfortunately, I desync a lot in this.
38790160	38794280	So I apologize if you're expecting perfect gameplay.
38794280	38795520	It is not possible with me.
38798680	38800200	I just realized what DLC means.
38800200	38802200	It's downloadable.
38802200	38804280	Wait, no.
38804280	38807040	Downloadable content?
38807040	38808640	Wait, that's not what DLC means.
38815920	38816680	Yeah.
38816680	38817720	OK, it does.
38817720	38819720	I was like, second guess, because I was like,
38819720	38821520	demo mode is one word.
38821520	38823920	But maybe back then, it was two words.
38833200	38837160	Stop moving around, ya bam.
38837160	38838960	He just sold spells.
38838960	38840760	It's been a pleasure, but I finally reached the end of
38840760	38842400	my endurance.
38842400	38843280	Not by my choice.
38843280	38844640	Can't be short on my sleep before work.
38844640	38845880	Yes, please rest well.
38845880	38848320	If you guys have work, if you guys have responsibilities,
38848320	38850960	please do not sacrifice your sleep or your
38850960	38853080	responsibilities to watch me.
38853080	38856080	I will be streaming all the hecking time.
38856080	38860200	And there will be plenty of VOD content to watch.
38860200	38863440	What?
38863440	38866800	That was like two seconds.
38866800	38869000	That was so quick.
38869000	38871400	That was unbelievably quick.
38871400	38874600	You know how earlier I quoted and said, this game is so
38874600	38876040	forgiving?
38876040	38878920	Wow.
38878920	38882880	That was like instant red bar pool.
38882880	38886760	I did not expect that.
38886760	38888720	I apologize.
38888720	38890680	I don't know how I was going to make that happen.
38890680	38892520	First time watching the stream for this long stamina
38892520	38894840	queen, I kneel, but I have to hit the bed.
38894840	38895720	Please rest.
38895720	38897320	Good night to those who sleep.
38897320	38901080	Goodbye to those who have a few things to do.
38901080	38903480	And get done.
38903480	38904560	Yeah.
38904560	38908120	Don't feel bad that you have to go do your thing.
38908120	38911920	Whoa, no, my controller died.
38911920	38914680	Oh, I can't play mouse and keyboard.
38914680	38917560	Oh, it's not even registered in mouse and keyboard anyway.
38917600	38920000	I'm going to have to go get my freaking charger.
38920000	38922480	Wait, is this a charger?
38922480	38926880	Oh, you spin me right round, baby, right round.
38926880	38930880	When you go down, when you go down now.
38930880	38937440	You spin my head round, round, round, round, round.
38937440	38938640	Is there a charger?
38938640	38940280	Hold on, I'm going for my cables.
38940280	38942200	We are going to desync because of distance.
38942200	38945080	I don't even think I have my charging cable in this dying
38945080	38947320	room.
38947360	38949440	Oh, I am so sorry.
38949440	38951600	I'm going to have to like back out and go quickly,
38951600	38952840	go get our charging cable.
38952840	38954760	I'm so sorry, but BRB, I'll be a second.
38977320	39004320	I can't believe I've played so long and drained my battery.
39004320	39005240	Oh, no.
39005240	39008040	Wait, what's that for?
39008040	39010840	What's that wire for?
39010840	39011320	Sugar.
39014560	39017200	Sugar, spice, and everything knife.
39017200	39020720	My headset is the front panel.
39020720	39023360	And the second USB port is taken up by the controller.
39023360	39026000	Hold on, hold on, let me get on my hands and knees.
39026000	39026960	Can I stop myself?
39026960	39028520	Can I?
39028520	39031440	Is there even a port back here?
39031440	39033560	Hello, is there a free port?
39033560	39036880	I don't think there's a free port.
39036880	39037880	Wow.
39037880	39044560	Um, do I need some light for face tracking?
39044560	39047240	I don't think so.
39047240	39049440	Goodness me.
39049440	39052000	I actually ran out of USB ports.
39052000	39059680	OK, um, wait, no, I'm very dumb.
39059680	39065520	I do not need the Bluetooth, the Bluetooth device is connected.
39065520	39068840	I don't need the Bluetooth bit because I will have the controller
39068840	39071680	plugged straight into the PC for charging purposes.
39071680	39073600	Yes, I figured it out.
39073600	39076240	One second.
39076240	39079280	Well, I apologize for the unprofessionalism.
39079280	39081520	However, I fixed the problem.
39081520	39084560	Thus, I am a trust me, I'm an engineer.
39084560	39086280	What the heck just happened here?
39086280	39090920	Because trust me, I'm an engineer.
39090920	39092880	I'm a very, very smart beat.
39092880	39094280	Yay.
39094280	39095680	Oh, have I desynced?
39095680	39098120	Oh, oh, I desynced because I was out of range.
39098120	39100080	That was a mistake on my part.
39100080	39101000	Whoopsie daisy.
39101000	39104480	OK, we'll try again.
39104480	39106040	The all the holes are filled.
39106040	39108120	Hey, yo.
39108120	39111640	How do you run out of USB ports in this day and age?
39111640	39114400	Nicola, wait, where am I going?
39114400	39117640	OK, let's hopefully not desync this time.
39117640	39120040	Because that was so aggressive, though.
39120040	39122640	I'm wondering if that should have been patched.
39122640	39127840	But because it was a layer of Romulus,
39127840	39131440	like not a lot of playtesters got through this part.
39131440	39135760	Because it was like the later content, like not main.
39135760	39140040	So that'd be interesting.
39140040	39141600	OK.
39141600	39144480	Got the gold.
39144480	39146440	I see you.
39146440	39151600	I'm just an average man with an average life.
39151600	39152560	Wait, where is it?
39152560	39154280	Lost him already.
39154280	39155960	Go in here.
39155960	39158920	Please don't desync, because that was so fast.
39163360	39165320	It's giving one thrust is all it took.
39165920	39171760	Oh, I'm not hiding.
39171760	39172760	I'm not hiding.
39172760	39174200	OK, I'm hiding now.
39174200	39176840	Don't do that again.
39176840	39178000	You're scaring me.
39178000	39181320	I think he goes over there.
39181320	39185320	I'm wondering if I should beat him before he moves.
39185320	39187280	Like this?
39187280	39190600	I think he goes through that gate right there, dead ahead.
39190600	39191640	So I'm.
39191640	39192440	Oh, no.
39196120	39196880	Distance.
39196880	39199920	He's not that far away from me.
39199920	39200920	I need to get back to work.
39200920	39201680	Have fun at work.
39205680	39207800	Please don't worry.
39207800	39209800	Veal, what's their hard work in?
39209800	39210920	Heck yeah.
39210920	39213240	And you know what they get?
39213240	39213720	Nothing.
39213720	39218360	I actually feel really bad about that.
39218360	39220160	Feels bad, man.
39220160	39220660	Ah!
39221660	39223660	Ah!
39223660	39227380	Ah, that was not fun.
39227380	39229140	Don't turn around again.
39229140	39232420	Do I make myself clear?
39232420	39234700	Yes, ma'am.
39234700	39236700	OK, easy, easy.
39236700	39240900	Take it easy, easy, easy, easy.
39240900	39243940	Bit closer, bit closer, bit closer.
39243940	39245180	He doesn't know.
39245180	39246980	Chat, he doesn't know.
39246980	39247580	He doesn't know.
39247580	39248180	He doesn't know.
39248180	39248780	He doesn't know.
39248780	39249460	He doesn't know.
39249460	39251860	He doesn't know.
39251860	39253580	So what hurts him?
39253580	39255100	He doesn't know.
39255100	39257700	Wait, what he doesn't know doesn't hurt him.
39257700	39258980	Yeah.
39258980	39259500	Good night.
39259500	39259980	Rest well.
39259980	39263140	All of those who have to go, please sleep well.
39263140	39267380	Make sure you deliver them convincingly with passion.
39267380	39270380	My passion.
39270380	39274420	Hey, hey, doofus, you're having a sad son following you.
39274420	39276100	Does he now?
39276100	39277060	They don't now.
39277060	39278700	Do you have the key?
39278700	39280300	Yes, ma'am.
39280300	39281460	Ma'am.
39281460	39284740	May the Lord be with you.
39284740	39287660	And also with you, ma'am.
39287660	39289780	I have a callus out.
39289780	39292140	He is five.
39292140	39294220	Remember the passion.
39294220	39296140	Passion for passion.
39296140	39299180	Right, I believe we can get caught now.
39299180	39300060	Oh, god.
39300060	39300820	You can't hear me.
39300820	39303740	He has air pods in.
39303740	39304240	Ah!
39304240	39307820	Asasino, you will not get me.
39307820	39309540	So this is the funniest thing ever.
39309540	39315380	He's in full gown and all of that.
39315380	39318220	And he's so agile.
39318220	39321060	And I'm not being funny, but if you've ever
39321060	39324260	worn a skirt before, it is so restrictive.
39324260	39328060	I think I've worn a skirt twice in my damn life.
39328060	39330300	Oh, there's jewelry down there.
39330300	39331980	Not jewelry.
39331980	39333340	Trita.
39333340	39335700	A bit of Trita.
39335700	39337980	These are one of the chase sequences
39337980	39340620	where he doesn't actually get out of range of view.
39340620	39342660	I'm like 99% sure.
39342660	39347700	He actually holds back if you're taken too long.
39347700	39350620	I've come out the wrong window.
39350620	39353460	But yeah, he actually waits for you, which is very nice of him.
39353460	39355900	I do appreciate when game devs do that.
39355900	39359580	I understand for the immersion you might want to actually
39359580	39362500	chase, but it's kind of nice not having your gameplay
39362540	39368420	interrupted because of kind of like small things like that.
39368420	39370260	I have to say Assassin's Creed definitely.
39370260	39372340	Gameplay isn't horrifically interrupted
39372340	39378980	if you're a bad player, which I do appreciate in video games.
39378980	39380180	Oh my god.
39380180	39383180	He said, no room at the inn.
39383180	39385860	Mother Mary.
39385860	39388460	No, little donkey.
39388460	39394780	Carrie Mary, then the dusty road.
39394780	39398260	I can't believe I've got the ninth sanctuary in a church.
39398260	39404660	Did you know that if you went to a church
39404660	39406700	and you were like a wanted criminal,
39406700	39410060	if you cleaned sanctuary, they couldn't get you back
39410060	39412900	in the old days.
39412900	39416700	But now, if you're a criminal and want to get away with it,
39416740	39421540	you just have to be super rich or no.
39421540	39425460	And have blackmail on them, that's pretty much it.
39425460	39427460	Sorry, I don't.
39427460	39429020	Wait, wait, that was supposed to happen.
39429020	39430500	OK, that was supposed to happen.
39430500	39432180	I was supposed to split.
39432180	39435460	I was like, oh, no, the camera angle's
39435460	39438060	a bit funky for claiming.
39438060	39439580	Oh, I don't like that.
39439580	39443860	Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
39443860	39444780	The key camera angle.
39448460	39451540	He is so agile for this old man pope.
39451540	39454780	Are you sure you aren't in the fast on yourself?
39454780	39456500	Well, this is getting a bit ridiculous, me.
39456500	39458060	I'm going to, me.
39458060	39461260	This is getting, I don't know what they are putting in your food,
39461260	39464940	like what they're blessing the holy bread with.
39464940	39471980	How on earth are you achieving any of these stunts?
39472020	39473500	My goodness, what is in that wine?
39481500	39482900	Oh, I'm confused.
39482900	39484580	Where am I supposed to go?
39484580	39485420	Oh, no, I missed it.
39485420	39485940	Oh, it's the light.
39485940	39487340	I'm sorry, it's the light.
39487340	39489860	Literally, rule one, follow the light.
39489860	39491020	And I couldn't even do that.
39491020	39491900	Where the heck am I going?
39491900	39494580	Oh, I'm getting so confused and turned around now.
39494580	39499020	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
39499020	39500460	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
39500460	39501940	Right, there we go.
39502900	39503400	Watch me.
39506780	39509860	I didn't even recall him doing that.
39509860	39510860	Where the heck am I going?
39517700	39520460	OK.
39520460	39521940	We've done it.
39521940	39525460	We've done it.
39525460	39529660	I can't wait to be rich to get away with things.
39529700	39532580	What on earth are you even for?
39532580	39535140	There's no order at all.
39535140	39540460	Oh, is this he's going to counter me?
39540460	39543780	Hey, right, you know what time it is, time for?
39543780	39545340	You don't need this, anyway.
39545340	39549020	You're devoted to God, so you don't even need this.
39549020	39550940	I'm doing you a favor.
39550940	39553460	And I'm probably, no, I'm not going to make the jokers
39553460	39555460	too obvious.
39555460	39559380	Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
39559380	39561980	Can I push him over the edge?
39561980	39564480	Push.
39564480	39565980	You saved me.
39565980	39566980	Oh, my god.
39570980	39571480	Oh.
39575340	39578220	I must have subconsciously known
39578220	39583460	that you could push him off the edge,
39583460	39585780	because how on earth did I remember that?
39590380	39591780	Oh, my goodness.
39596780	39598580	That must be main story.
39598580	39600780	You must always push him off the end or something,
39600780	39603180	because there's no way I would have thought of that myself.
39603180	39604780	I must have done it before in the past.
39604780	39608580	I don't remember much of Romuli, because I don't do it.
39608580	39612980	When I replay the game, I'm actually anonymous.
39612980	39615980	I am wired in.
39620380	39623380	Wait, did I do that in time?
39623380	39625380	Is that 100% that?
39625380	39627380	Did you hear about this?
39627380	39629380	Did you see this news?
39629380	39630380	I did!
39630380	39632380	Okay, we don't have to do that.
39632380	39634380	Are you sadistic?
39636380	39638380	Yeah, I'm like, how would I have known that?
39638380	39642380	But it must always happen plausibly.
39644380	39645380	Easy clip.
39645380	39648380	We've got one more layer to go.
39651380	39653380	Catching a flight.
39653380	39655380	Safe travels, Landstrider.
39656380	39657380	Thanks for hanging.
39658380	39661380	New outfit unlocked in the inventory menu.
39661380	39665380	No, I haven't done anything to earn that, so that's not correct.
39665380	39668380	Okay, the next location is Il Colosseo.
39669380	39671380	I'm just going to check.
39671380	39674380	I think my takeaway got delivered.
39674380	39678380	So if you just give me one second, we are going to go to the Il Colosseum,
39678380	39683380	and we are going to do the last layer of Romuli and unlock the armor.
39683380	39685380	The armor looks pretty cool.
39685380	39689380	You can see my health bars now, how I haven't invested in any armor at all.
39689380	39694380	Once we get the armor of Romuli.
39694380	39696380	Yeah, you're going like it.
39697380	39699380	Give me one second just to check.
39699380	39701380	I think it has been delivered.
39704380	39706380	Let's go.
39734380	39735380	Let's go.
39764380	39765380	Let's go.
39765380	39766380	Let's go.
39766380	39767380	Let's go.
39792380	39795380	Guess which fat bastard got a takeaway?
39795380	39796380	Give me.
39799380	39804380	I have a spicy chicken burger in chip and sprite.
39804380	39805380	That's what I got.
39809380	39811380	I'm going to take more drinks of water though.
39814380	39817380	But we're definitely going to get the armor.
39817380	39820380	I don't know if we're going to get anything else, unfortunately.
39820380	39825380	I'm going to eat it now because I don't know if you have this problem
39825380	39831380	with delivery where you're from, but the driver hangs about at the restaurant
39831380	39835380	to try and get a double order, and then the food arrives cold
39835380	39838380	because they've waited so long to try and get a double order.
39840380	39843380	And it's so annoying, like it happens all the time.
39844380	39850380	And yeah, I'm like 99% sure it's happened
39850380	39855380	because that took so long from the last break I had to get here.
39859380	39860380	That happens to you too.
39860380	39865380	Okay, I've got chicken burger, spicy chicken burger and chips,
39865380	39867380	and I've got sprite.
39868380	39870380	Or my fizzy juice.
39872380	39875380	They added the prioritise option.
39875380	39880380	What, instead of just getting actually telling the drivers to deliver the food hot?
39881380	39884380	That's pretty ridiculous, honestly.
39888380	39890380	And hanging around.
39893380	39896380	Sorry for those of you who don't like eating.
39897380	39900380	I've been streaming for 11 hours and I need to refuel,
39900380	39902380	and this is my food before bed.
39902380	39904380	Literally, I'm going to brush my teeth.
39904380	39907380	I'm going to check the girls are okay on the discord.
39907380	39910380	And if all is good, then bedtime for me.
39913380	39918380	I was up around two hours, no, four hours before stream.
39919380	39927380	And then I managed to speak to Mimosa from Yumi Plus about the ASMR.
39927380	39930380	But that was like one hour before stream,
39930380	39933380	and then I had to send Clippers some stuff for the girls.
39936380	39938380	But things are settling down, they're calming down.
39938380	39941380	It's a bit chaotic, but you lead.
39948380	39951380	A little bit busy, but it's going to calm down.
39951380	39954380	And especially when the script manager comes into play,
39954380	39956380	I literally don't have to do anything.
39956380	39960380	So yeah, if you hate any of the scripts that the girls do,
39960380	39964380	you're welcome to just send a marshmallow and be like, you suck.
39964380	39967380	But yeah, I know, that's fine.
39970380	39972380	But yeah.
39973380	39978380	Hopefully for those of you who have never seen Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,
39978380	39982380	I may have given you a new opinion of the game.
39982380	39987380	Or maybe I've influenced your opinion of the game.
39990380	39993380	Better give them time out of time for me.
40002380	40004380	It's so annoying.
40004380	40007380	Like, I don't know when YouTube will fix that.
40007380	40012380	The thing is, YouTube is slowly becoming like a much better platform
40012380	40015380	to live stream on than Twitch.
40015380	40017380	There's no doubt about it in my head.
40017380	40021380	They are just so slow to catch up and implement things.
40021380	40023380	Like, so slow.
40025380	40029380	But I hope they fix that 12-hour reward thing.
40029380	40035380	Because if they do, then strapping for 14-hour streams!
40038380	40041380	Next paycheck, I'll pick up Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
40041380	40042380	And two.
40042380	40043380	Mmm!
40043380	40049380	Actually, on Steam, you do require a Ubisoft account once you get it.
40049380	40056380	However, on Steam, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is on sale right now for $5.
40056380	40059380	If you have it on your account, I think you can grab it.
40060380	40062380	But that's just for Brotherhood.
40064380	40066380	I don't know about the odd guys.
40070380	40072380	Sorry, I'm itching my face.
40078380	40079380	Good morning!
40079380	40081380	No, I didn't lie, I'm still here.
40082380	40087380	I thought I was going to do 10 hours, but I'm like, ah, we can do more.
40091380	40095380	Good morning to the sleepyheads and goodnight to the sleepyheads
40095380	40097380	because you're all probably sleepy.
40101380	40104380	It depends what you make for YouTube Discoverability
40104380	40108380	for streaming-only content for Discoverability.
40108380	40116380	Yeah, if you do Shorts, however, and ASMR, for example, then you can be discovered.
40116380	40120380	I don't know about how Twitch's Discoverability works, unfortunately.
40124380	40127380	It's 5pm here, I passed out most of the day.
40127380	40129380	Sounded like you needed the rest then.
40132380	40135380	I can feel deep vein thrombosis sitting in all right-
40135380	40136380	Do you need to stretch?
40136380	40139380	Maybe I should have told you to stretch.
40147380	40153380	I'm eating all the chips first because they're getting cold.
40155380	40157380	Twitch has very low Discoverability.
40157380	40159380	That's what I thought.
40159380	40162380	Whereas like YouTube, at least I know how YouTube works.
40163380	40169380	For the most part, I say that as if Emmy didn't get a warning on YouTube.
40179380	40181380	My brain's so American I thought you meant actual chips.
40181380	40190380	Ah, um, deep fried potato in a vat, in a rectangular, skinny, rectangular shape.
40192380	40193380	Yeah, man.
40198380	40199380	French fries.
40201380	40204380	Managed maggot, no, I'll get 100%.
40205380	40209380	I thought that was my cup for setting this all up.
40212380	40213380	Stinky management.
40213380	40216380	Imagine if I got graduated by my own management.
40217380	40218380	Uh-huh.
40219380	40223380	Um, they're not flavor.
40226380	40228380	With salt and fat, maybe.
40228380	40230380	And maybe large oil.
40234380	40236380	Is it management hate time?
40236380	40238380	Oh, is it that time already?
40240380	40241380	Scottish food stream.
40241380	40244380	I don't even think I have access to haggis here.
40245380	40247380	Which is a shame.
40248380	40253380	But I'm doing a Scottish game show on St Andrews for the girls.
40253380	40260380	I'm gonna like get them to guess Scottish memes or spell Scottish words
40260380	40266380	or tell me what the, the Scottish phrase says type thing.
40266380	40267380	Absurd.
40267380	40269380	When I eat, I burp a lot more.
40269380	40271380	I put all the junk in.
40271380	40272380	I'm so guessing.
40278380	40280380	School of rock.
40284380	40285380	Okay.
40285380	40286380	I finished my chippies.
40286380	40288380	I'm now going to inhale the booger.
40295380	40297380	I need to know what food places are good in Scotland.
40297380	40298380	Greggs!
40298380	40300380	That sounds terrible.
40300380	40303380	It's a British UK chain called Greggs.
40304380	40312380	And they do this thing called a cheese, bean and sausage pastry, pastry?
40312380	40313380	Pasty.
40314380	40316380	And, oh.
40318380	40319380	It is.
40320380	40321380	It is.
40322380	40324380	You know, it's so good.
40324380	40328380	I like the cheese and hamburger from Greggs as well.
40328380	40329380	Very good.
40329380	40330380	Very proof.
40331380	40332380	Mmm.
40332380	40334380	Tesco meal deal.
40334380	40337380	They used to be three quid, but they're not anymore.
40337380	40339380	Are they, are they 350 now?
40339380	40341380	Or is it going on more?
40348380	40349380	Oh.
40349380	40350380	Hold on.
40350380	40351380	Oh.
40357380	40362380	I, because I laughed, a bit of dry chip went like up back my nostril.
40362380	40364380	That was very painful momentarily.
40364380	40365380	Ew.
40369380	40372380	I've never had a chance to try protein.
40372380	40379380	I believe it's cheese and chips.
40381380	40382380	And gravy?
40382380	40384380	I'm taking big bite of burger.
40384380	40385380	Do you want bite first?
40385380	40386380	Go, ah.
40386380	40388380	You can get bite of burger first.
40388380	40389380	Ah.
40392380	40395380	Do you like, you're actually putting, oh yeah.
40395380	40398380	A and W is pretty nice too if you get to try them.
40398380	40400380	I don't know what A and W is.
40400380	40401380	I'm sorry.
40401380	40405380	Is it a supermarket or is it like a takeaway place?
40406380	40407380	Oh.
40409380	40411380	Oh, the burger club.
40411380	40413380	Chicken burger.
40413380	40415380	With crunchy lettuce.
40415380	40416380	Mmm.
40424380	40427380	Sorry, I've been traumatized for going, oh.
40427380	40429380	I didn't know she was going to do that.
40429380	40430380	I was like, oh.
40430380	40431380	Oh.
40434380	40438380	A and W is almost bust, really?
40440380	40442380	Protein Canada mentioned, yeah.
40442380	40444380	It's chips, gravy and cheese.
40444380	40447380	And you can customize it with bacon, sausage, egg,
40447380	40449380	or any food you can think of adding.
40449380	40450380	Mmm.
40450380	40452380	A and W is a fast food chain.
40452380	40454380	They have good chicken burgers.
40454380	40456380	Oh, I like chicken burgers.
40456380	40460380	When I was a child, I got to visit America.
40460380	40461380	Americaia!
40461380	40462380	Hello!
40462380	40465380	And I got to try McDonald's.
40465380	40470380	And we went to Red Lobster.
40470380	40474380	And there were real live lobsters in the tank
40474380	40476380	that could be picked out.
40476380	40481380	And we didn't like that.
40481380	40483380	We're not used to that.
40484380	40486380	And it's a unique thing.
40486380	40489380	But I completely understand that markets exist.
40489380	40491380	Obviously, there's fish markets.
40491380	40493380	You go and they're live fish and stuff.
40493380	40496380	All sitting about ready to get bought and sliced and diced.
40496380	40498380	I understand that's how the world works.
40498380	40500380	I would just have a soft little soul.
40500380	40502380	I say that as I eat chicken,
40502380	40505380	which is from a breed of chicken
40505380	40509380	that purposely grows meat,
40509380	40511380	weight at a really fast rate,
40511380	40513380	and is probably no older than 12 weeks.
40513380	40516380	I understand how hypocritical I'm being.
40516380	40518380	I comprehend that.
40518380	40520380	I do comprehend that.
40520380	40522380	I've got to sleep.
40522380	40524380	The Sandman calls me.
40524380	40528380	The Sandman from Spider-Man?
40528380	40531380	What kind of demons are you fighting?
40531380	40534380	If Sandman is your nemesis,
40534380	40536380	are you good?
40536380	40537380	Do you need help?
40537380	40539380	Are they jumping you?
40542380	40544380	Sleep well.
40546380	40548380	What's the Sandman?
40550380	40553380	Is it that song, Mr. Sandman?
40553380	40555380	Give me a dream.
40555380	40557380	Bum bum bum bum.
40557380	40560380	Make him the cutest that I've ever seen.
40560380	40562380	Yeah, but who is Mr. Sandman?
40565380	40566380	Is it Sleep Demon?
40566380	40567380	Is it actually?
40567380	40568380	I'll believe you.
40568380	40569380	I will believe you.
40572380	40576380	The Sandman is the one who puts fit...
40576380	40578380	I ain't reading all that.
40580380	40581380	Wait.
40581380	40584380	He puts the sleepy sand in your eyes
40584380	40585380	that make you go,
40585380	40587380	are you trolling me or is this real?
40587380	40589380	Sandman from the store?
40589380	40591380	American stories?
40593380	40595380	I have not heard of Sandman like this
40595380	40597380	in this content.
40598380	40600380	It's real?
40603380	40604380	Okay.
40604380	40605380	Wait.
40605380	40608380	So, is the song Mr. Sandman?
40608380	40609380	Give me a dream.
40609380	40610380	Bum bum bum.
40610380	40611380	Make him the cutest I've ever seen.
40611380	40614380	Is that someone asking Mr. Sandman
40614380	40618380	to give her a dream about a man she really likes?
40620380	40621380	He puts gunk in your eyes.
40621380	40624380	Okay, I'm starting to believe that's actually the lore.
40627380	40628380	Yes!
40632380	40634380	Today I learned.
40634380	40635380	Okay.
40637380	40639380	Is it like a story book
40639380	40642380	or is this lore from the song only?
40642380	40645380	The Sandman is a mythical character in European folklore
40645380	40647380	who puts people to sleep
40647380	40649380	and encourages and inspires beautiful dreams
40649380	40651380	by sprinkling magical sander.
40652380	40655380	Okay, that song makes complete sense now.
40655380	40657380	I've never heard that story.
40658380	40661380	I must love Mr. Sandman.
40661380	40663380	Give me a dream.
40663380	40664380	Bum bum bum.
40664380	40667380	Make him the cutest I've ever seen.
40667380	40668380	Bum bum bum.
40668380	40672380	Give him two lips like roses and clovers.
40676380	40679380	You've never watched Rise of the Guardian?
40679380	40680380	No.
40680380	40683380	I've watched Guardians of the Galaxy, though.
40683380	40686380	Baby, give me one more chance.
40688380	40690380	I eat more burger.
40698380	40700380	Sandman's on Rise of the Guardian.
40700380	40701380	That's cool.
40701380	40703380	It was Rise of the Guardian.
40703380	40706380	Sorry, I feel like every time you guys reference something,
40706380	40707380	I'm like, what's that?
40707380	40709380	Oh, what is this?
40709380	40711380	I've never heard of this before.
40711380	40712380	Hee hee.
40720380	40722380	Is it like Power of Alanis?
40723380	40724380	No.
40724380	40726380	The Secrets of Alanis?
40726380	40727380	Alanis.
40727380	40729380	This may be the name of the movie.
40732380	40735380	It's a movie with Jack Frost in it.
40735380	40736380	Okay.
40736380	40737380	Hmm.
40740380	40743380	Where this Sandman, Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus,
40743380	40745380	the Easter Bunny, and Jack Frost team up
40745380	40747380	to kick the crap out of a Nightmare Demon.
40747380	40750380	Ah, that sounds like a good movie.
40750380	40751380	Hmm.
40751380	40753380	Is it like Nightmare Before Christmas?
40753380	40755380	I love Nightmare Before Christmas.
40755380	40757380	We should watch Nightmare Before Christmas.
40757380	40759380	We have so many things to watch.
40759380	40760380	Life is good.
40763380	40764380	Hmm.
40767380	40770380	They put so much hot sauce on my boy boy.
40776380	40777380	Hmm.
40777380	40779380	Basically form an Avengers style team up.
40779380	40780380	Yeah.
40780380	40782380	I love Avengers one.
40782380	40784380	I know it's cringey, but I like it.
40784380	40785380	Hmm.
40786380	40788380	Ah, the sauce is burning my face.
40797380	40799380	Oh, she's buzzing.
40799380	40800380	She's buzzing.
40802380	40803380	Hmm.
40804380	40805380	Wow.
40806380	40809380	Oh, I can share my family's movie.
40809380	40811380	On Christmas.
40812380	40815380	The family movie is Trading Places,
40815380	40817380	and there's booba in it.
40817380	40819380	I used to watch it as a kid.
40820380	40821380	Look, there's booba.
40821380	40822380	Ah.
40824380	40825380	Hmm.
40827380	40829380	It's delicious.
40830380	40832380	After all my hard work today,
40832380	40833380	it wasn't hard work.
40833380	40835380	I literally got to just gleam about
40835380	40836380	my favorite video game.
40836380	40837380	It's not work.
40837380	40839380	I promise you, this stuff ain't work.
40839380	40842380	If each of them feels like work,
40843380	40844380	then...
40846380	40848380	then I will give you the advice
40848380	40849380	of just do what you want,
40849380	40850380	and then it doesn't feel like work.
40850380	40851380	Hmm.
40851380	40852380	But oh wait, no, that's a responsible.
40852380	40853380	I shouldn't say that.
40853380	40854380	I'm not kidding.
40854380	40856380	Is there a sneak peek of the Eat Sweet Stream?
40856380	40858380	No, I don't even have the sweets.
40859380	40860380	Um.
40860380	40863380	I might have to get my nails did for it.
40863380	40864380	Ah.
40867380	40868380	Jamie Lee Biba?
40868380	40869380	I mean Biba Lee Curtis?
40869380	40873380	I used to think that Jamie Lee Curtis
40873380	40875380	was Princess Leia,
40875380	40878380	because I grew up watching Star Wars.
40878380	40881380	So when I saw her, I was like,
40882380	40883380	Dad!
40883380	40884380	Like, I was a child child.
40884380	40885380	I was like,
40885380	40887380	Dad, why is Princess Leia's boobies on the tail?
40889380	40891380	Um, basically.
40898380	40899380	No, no.
40899380	40900380	Okay.
40900380	40903380	I don't think I can eat any more of the burger.
40904380	40907380	It appears I don't have a large appetite,
40907380	40908380	but I wonder if it's just because
40908380	40910380	I've been having such a good time that, like,
40910380	40912380	I did actually have that fruit,
40912380	40914380	which fruit is actually really good for fiber,
40914380	40917380	so maybe that's why I don't feel like eating the full thing.
40918380	40920380	Oh, I'm such a skinny legend.
40920380	40923380	Okay, let's finish up this whole layer of bromelain.
40923380	40925380	I think I was gifted this game a long time ago
40925380	40927380	and never ended up playing on it.
40927380	40928380	Mmm!
40928380	40932380	So, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the second
40932380	40936380	installment of Ezio Auditory's story, The Assassin.
40936380	40940380	Um, it's my favourite game of all time.
40941380	40947380	Um, I can only recommend it if you like,
40947380	40951380	kind of role-playing and you like games that hold your hand,
40951380	40953380	like, it's perfect.
40953380	40955380	We've finished the campaign already.
40955380	40957380	We finished it a couple hours ago now.
40957380	40963380	Um, and we're just finishing up a kind of side quest-esque sequence,
40963380	40968380	which is going to unlock some very OP armor.
40968380	40970380	It's a really good game.
40970380	40971380	I do recommend it.
40971380	40975380	I don't know if it's a game for a stream for the first time
40975380	40977380	you've ever played it.
40977380	40979380	I don't know, like, I mean, I love the game,
40979380	40981380	but obviously it's really hard to tell, like,
40981380	40982380	what kind of game someone would be into.
40982380	40985380	And Emi, I know you said you weren't the biggest,
40985380	40987380	like, strongest gamer, but you're like a weebo
40987380	40989380	or a gamer-type thing.
40989380	40991380	Um, but this is definitely friend.
40991380	40993380	I would say Brotherhood's friendly to, like, new gamers,
40993380	40997380	is once you understand the controls,
40997380	40999380	but then again, I have played the game like a...
40999380	41001380	Oh, I did not mean to do that.
41001380	41005380	Um, but I have played the game, like, a billion times over, so...
41005380	41007380	Can people stream through 12 hours on YouTube?
41007380	41012380	Sadly, no, the VOD ends up getting really broken
41012380	41014380	at the 12-hour mark, so I will be...
41014380	41018380	Oh, I don't want to end...
41019380	41022380	Oh, it's becoming my bedtime soon, though.
41022380	41024380	Oh, I don't want to end.
41024380	41027380	Right, well, very quickly do the last layer.
41027380	41030380	I didn't realise how long it took me to eat that food there.
41030380	41033380	I apologise. I should have... I should have sped that up.
41033380	41035380	Sorry.
41035380	41038380	Right, we will take a... this to the tunnel
41038380	41041380	to go where we need to go for this last...
41041380	41043380	to the Il Colosseum,
41043380	41045380	because that's where we need to go last,
41045380	41047380	and then we will get the armour,
41047380	41049380	because that's why we have had a fantastic
41049380	41051380	first official stream,
41051380	41053380	um, debut stream,
41053380	41056380	and the exposing wheeler and all that.
41056380	41059380	Don't count, um...
41059380	41062380	because I said they don't count, smile.
41062380	41064380	Um...
41064380	41066380	This is, like, actual stream.
41066380	41068380	This is just me doing my hang.
41068380	41070380	I know I said I...
41070380	41074380	Oh! It's you! You can't just jump on folk like that!
41075380	41077380	That's inappropriate of me!
41077380	41079380	You're going to get done for that.
41079380	41081380	You're going to get the jail.
41081380	41083380	They're going to give you the jail. They're going to take you away.
41083380	41085380	Eh, see, they need to do that again,
41085380	41087380	because that was actually really scary.
41087380	41089380	That was, like, a vampire launch.
41089380	41091380	Like...
41091380	41093380	What would Colosseum mean?
41093380	41095380	Randomly tops.
41095380	41097380	Literally, like, uh...
41097380	41099380	Eh, see, that's dangerous.
41099380	41101380	You're 35 minutes away from the travel.
41101380	41103380	No, don't say that!
41104380	41106380	Hmm.
41106380	41108380	Uh...
41108380	41110380	Uh, hold on.
41110380	41114380	Uh, I'm using my thigh to run right now, like a five-head.
41114380	41116380	Oh, hold on. Hold on.
41116380	41119380	You can tell. You can tell I'm not using agile controls.
41119380	41121380	Oh, it's on the outside. It's on the outside.
41121380	41123380	Here, here, yeah.
41123380	41125380	You walk past it when you actually deliver...
41125380	41127380	Do the deliver the male one.
41127380	41129380	Um...
41129380	41131380	Okay, boom, boom, boom, boom. Already there.
41131380	41133380	Already there!
41133380	41135380	At least this, we're gonna get our armor,
41135380	41137380	and then we are done, zoop.
41138380	41140380	I cannot for the life of me
41140380	41142380	remember what's behind this whole, uh,
41142380	41145380	of this layer of Romulae.
41145380	41147380	Romulus!
41147380	41149380	Keep saying Romulae.
41149380	41151380	Is it because of Star Trek? I'm saying Romulae.
41151380	41153380	It is!
41153380	41155380	It's because of Star Trek.
41156380	41159380	I think he doodoo-ed Star Trek.
41159380	41161380	Yeah!
41161380	41163380	I also watch Star Trek.
41163380	41165380	What?
41165380	41167380	Star Trek Voyager?
41167380	41169380	A bit of Deep Space Nine,
41169380	41171380	and, uh...
41171380	41173380	Captain Picard?
41173380	41175380	I cannot remember.
41175380	41177380	I wouldn't say Star Trek Original, but that's...
41177380	41179380	I don't think that's right.
41179380	41181380	Star Trek Origin?
41181380	41183380	Bet that too.
41183380	41185380	Would be Romulae.
41185380	41187380	Yeah, that's why I keep saying Romulae.
41187380	41190380	Instead of Romulus, it's because I watch Star Trek.
41191380	41193380	Um...
41193380	41195380	Oh, I wonder why you watch Star Trek.
41195380	41197380	Oh, surprise, surprise.
41197380	41199380	It's my dad, yet again, got me into it.
41199380	41201380	I can't believe it. My dad's the reason
41201380	41203380	why I actually have a personality.
41203380	41205380	That is terrible.
41205380	41207380	That's not nice.
41207380	41209380	Don't say things like that.
41209380	41211380	Assassin must suffer as we must suffer.
41211380	41213380	I forgot
41213380	41215380	what 100% was.
41215380	41217380	Do not lose more than three health blocks.
41217380	41219380	Easy, peasy, lemon,
41220380	41222380	Please don't launch at me.
41222380	41224380	Okay, there we go. We got the small knife out.
41224380	41226380	That's all we need.
41226380	41228380	Right, three health blocks.
41228380	41230380	As long as they don't do throwing knives,
41230380	41232380	then it's perfectly fine. Did you hear that stress
41232380	41234380	when I had to counter that attack there?
41234380	41236380	Okay.
41236380	41238380	Come at me.
41249380	41251380	Never.
41251380	41253380	Never.
41253380	41255380	Gee, that sure makes you look innocent.
41255380	41257380	Not.
41257380	41259380	Uh, again,
41259380	41261380	I believe this is time,
41261380	41263380	so I might try hard a little bit.
41265380	41267380	I can't believe it.
41267380	41269380	I'm such a sweat.
41269380	41271380	Who goes there?
41271380	41273380	Identify yourself.
41275380	41277380	I was on him.
41277380	41279380	I guess this sequence,
41279380	41281380	you're not at all supposed to catch him,
41281380	41283380	but I'm actually just such an MLG gamer
41283380	41285380	that I caught right up to him.
41285380	41287380	I literally could yank on his cloak like yaga.
41287380	41289380	Thank you.
41293380	41295380	Yeah.
41295380	41297380	Oh, okay, I remember this.
41297380	41299380	Yeah, there's like a party going on.
41299380	41301380	Oh my God, that lag because it's loading the area.
41301380	41303380	Jubilee Performers
41303380	41305380	has an access database.
41305380	41307380	I never sat in red.
41307380	41309380	What's up with this game?
41309380	41311380	Oh, what am I supposed to do?
41311380	41313380	Am I supposed to follow in that way?
41315380	41317380	Uh, right.
41317380	41319380	Go up the ladders.
41319380	41321380	Clearly, yeah, clearly he's going to shut down that wall.
41321380	41323380	I'm so sorry.
41327380	41329380	I bless your dad.
41329380	41331380	Literally make me...
41331380	41333380	Oh no, I've never correctly done this
41333380	41335380	horse sequence.
41335380	41337380	I just want you all to know.
41337380	41339380	So you can catch him in this sequence.
41339380	41341380	I never seem to catch up.
41341380	41343380	I don't know what I'm supposed to do
41343380	41345380	to make it happen.
41345380	41347380	Um,
41347380	41349380	but yeah.
41349380	41351380	Gee, I wonder why I've never made the sequence.
41351380	41353380	Me who does that.
41353380	41355380	I'm like pretty sure at the end
41355380	41357380	you're supposed to be able to jump on him
41357380	41359380	and I never make the timing.
41359380	41361380	It doesn't matter what happens.
41361380	41363380	Oh,
41363380	41365380	Gee, I wonder why I never catch up to him.
41365380	41367380	Surely it's a mystery.
41367380	41369380	No one
41369380	41371380	can solve this mathematical equation
41371380	41373380	as to why I've never caught up
41373380	41375380	with this guy.
41375380	41377380	Right, this is when I'm supposed to be able to do it.
41381380	41383380	Hi Jack.
41383380	41385380	Please.
41385380	41387380	What is go...
41391380	41393380	Exio?
41393380	41395380	Exio.
41395380	41397380	Son.
41397380	41399380	Son, do you want to talk about what just happened
41399380	41401380	or are we just going to pretend that didn't occur?
41403380	41405380	It'll literally...
41405380	41407380	Oh, I do not want to get in a fight with him.
41407380	41409380	So we're just going to sneak on by.
41409380	41411380	Sneak on by.
41415380	41417380	Oh, we've been here before.
41417380	41419380	We have been here before.
41419380	41421380	Wee.
41425380	41427380	Eh?
41427380	41429380	I knew under the stairs
41429380	41431380	looked like a game,
41431380	41433380	like an addition.
41433380	41435380	I knew it.
41435380	41437380	I forgot.
41437380	41439380	Ah.
41439380	41441380	I knew under the stairs
41441380	41443380	it looked like there was something there.
41443380	41445380	Oh my god, I'm actually just...
41445380	41447380	I'm just so smart like that,
41447380	41449380	like seriously for real for real.
41449380	41451380	Did Exio just
41451380	41453380	stuff him in his pocket?
41453380	41455380	Literally.
41455380	41457380	We did it!
41457380	41459380	We got the armor.
41459380	41461380	Codex sheet acquired.
41461380	41463380	Return to room.
41469380	41471380	Galaticator.
41471380	41473380	On the escalator.
41473380	41475380	On the escalator.
41475380	41477380	Animal crossing villager attack.
41479380	41481380	I did it! We did it!
41481380	41483380	No, I'm going to show you where
41483380	41485380	the treasure room
41485380	41487380	is hidden. It took me a very long time
41487380	41489380	on my first playthrough to figure out
41489380	41491380	where on Earth this treasure room was.
41491380	41493380	Have you seen the movie Gladiator?
41493380	41495380	I haven't!
41495380	41497380	You want to watch this together
41497380	41499380	sometime with me?
41499380	41501380	What happens if we
41501380	41503380	did lots of
41503380	41505380	watch-alongs of all the movies I haven't seen?
41505380	41507380	Because I haven't seen a lot of mainstream
41507380	41509380	movies.
41509380	41511380	Because I'm
41511380	41513380	a gamer and I kind of just play
41513380	41515380	games and that's all I do.
41515380	41517380	I don't really watch much
41517380	41519380	anime.
41519380	41521380	And I hope that's not
41521380	41523380	disappointing to anyone, but
41523380	41525380	I think it's good that all of us have a mix.
41525380	41527380	Some of us are clearly a weeble
41527380	41529380	gamer type thing.
41529380	41531380	My strength is like
41531380	41533380	strength in quotation marks.
41533380	41535380	My strength is that I can play
41535380	41537380	games.
41537380	41539380	No strongy.
41539380	41541380	That's not what strength means.
41541380	41543380	However,
41543380	41545380	my
41545380	41547380	accolades,
41547380	41549380	I just always enjoyed gaming.
41549380	41551380	I did get very lucky.
41551380	41553380	I've heard some stories from
41553380	41555380	girls being like,
41555380	41557380	their parents actively discouraged them
41557380	41559380	from gaming and I'm like
41559380	41561380	I just feel so bad
41561380	41563380	because I am very
41563380	41565380	lucky and I get so much enjoyment.
41565380	41567380	So much enjoyment
41567380	41569380	out of the games that I'm about to
41569380	41571380	sneeze about to play.
41571380	41573380	I just went away because I called it out.
41573380	41575380	I have absolutely no idea
41575380	41577380	where I'm trying to go to get to this.
41577380	41579380	Okay, I just need to go around the hill.
41579380	41581380	It's fine.
41581380	41583380	I've heard some stories about girls being
41583380	41585380	like I just called it out.
41585380	41587380	It's just such a shame.
41587380	41589380	Actually, you know what?
41589380	41591380	I take that back.
41591380	41593380	I've also heard stories from guys
41593380	41595380	like their parents are like,
41595380	41597380	you're just wasting your life on games.
41597380	41599380	What am I supposed to do as a pastime
41599380	41601380	in a hobby? Everyone has something
41601380	41603380	that helps them get through the day.
41603380	41605380	I'm not being funny.
41605380	41607380	I'm really happy to get into the subject
41607380	41609380	of how humans
41609380	41611380	recreationally need to deal
41611380	41613380	with daily working life.
41613380	41615380	So some people use drinking.
41615380	41617380	Some people use smoking.
41617380	41619380	Some people use recreational drugs
41619380	41621380	in order to cope with the stresses of the day.
41621380	41623380	And like
41623380	41625380	folk who act like
41625380	41627380	gay men is like this.
41627380	41629380	Oh, by the way, this is where the treasure room is hiding.
41629380	41631380	It doesn't look like it, but in this little room
41631380	41633380	where you kill the captain for this
41633380	41635380	bourgeois area, you
41635380	41637380	climb up and then you find the treasure room.
41637380	41639380	Um...
41639380	41641380	And like, literally, I find it like such a shame
41641380	41643380	because like,
41643380	41645380	you don't really realize how supportive your parents are
41645380	41647380	until you get told stories.
41647380	41649380	Right, I'll show up, because it's big.
41654380	41656380	Wow!
41657380	41659380	It looks like shade.
41659380	41661380	Honestly, this is pretty bad.
41662380	41664380	I mean, it looks good, but it looks bad.
41664380	41666380	At the same time.
41668380	41670380	Oh, Jesus.
41671380	41673380	I mean...
41673380	41675380	I mean, it's alright.
41676380	41678380	I don't...
41678380	41680380	I much prefer alpires.
41680380	41682380	Armor.
41682380	41684380	From AC-1. AC-2.
41684380	41686380	Um, when you unlock all the seals.
41687380	41689380	Germans? Oh!
41689380	41691380	I read that as
41691380	41693380	Germans truly are the most repressed group in society.
41693380	41695380	Gamers are the most repressed
41695380	41698380	group in society. Even alcohol and smokers get more, right?
41698380	41700380	Yeah, literally, games are the reason
41700380	41702380	why you can use the right side of my body like normal.
41702380	41704380	Yeah, like, everyone
41704380	41706380	needs something that helps them de-stress
41706380	41708380	from daily life.
41708380	41710380	And like, I just feel so sad that people
41710380	41712380	like, genuinely have like...
41713380	41715380	I suppose if you get into the conversation
41715380	41717380	of like, loved ones and...
41719380	41721380	Like, nothing they have to support
41721380	41723380	everything you do, like, that's not how it works in the real world.
41723380	41726380	But like, I don't know, I just...
41726380	41728380	I couldn't imagine
41728380	41730380	like, my mom and dad
41730380	41732380	being like...
41733380	41735380	Or...
41735380	41737380	like, you're on the Xbox.
41737380	41739380	Well, actually, so they did kind of say that, but
41739380	41741380	I was having problems with social anxiety and all that
41741380	41743380	and I couldn't go outside in that. So that's different.
41743380	41745380	That section's different.
41745380	41747380	But, like,
41747380	41749380	genuinely, like, at no point
41749380	41751380	where like, my mom and dad disappointed in me
41751380	41753380	because I liked the game. And they like, supported it.
41753380	41755380	Like, my mom
41755380	41757380	she played the original Lara Croft
41757380	41759380	Tomb Raider and like, my dad
41759380	41761380	obviously showed me a whole
41761380	41763380	insane category of games
41763380	41765380	that got me used to like, all these different categories
41765380	41767380	and...
41767380	41769380	that kind of thing. And it's just like, really nice.
41769380	41771380	Like, my dad, he absolutely
41771380	41773380	loves to tell the story about how he gave me an Xbox
41773380	41775380	and
41775380	41777380	he'll probably tell it
41777380	41779380	when I do my interview with him.
41779380	41781380	And I say
41781380	41783380	interview. I'm just getting my dad to talk
41783380	41785380	about it.
41785380	41787380	But talk about, like, how does it feel
41787380	41789380	that your daughter's a slag? And then
41789380	41791380	he goes, it feels pretty good
41791380	41793380	because I'm going to retire
41793380	41795380	and da-da-da-da-da.
41795380	41797380	Um...
41797380	41799380	I don't know what's going on here. Like, some people know this.
41799380	41801380	Like, I managed to...
41801380	41803380	Because of the banks
41803380	41805380	and job issues and all that kind of thing
41805380	41807380	basically, the house was going to get repossessed.
41807380	41809380	Like, the family home was going to get repossessed.
41809380	41811380	Because, you know, they kind of keep up
41811380	41813380	with mortgage payments. So then I bought it.
41813380	41815380	Like, I don't own it.
41815380	41817380	Like, my parents own it. But, like, I
41817380	41819380	did the difference.
41819380	41821380	Um...
41821380	41823380	And my dad's like...
41823380	41825380	He's kind of joking when he says, like, the only reason
41825380	41827380	that, like, you're
41827380	41829380	like, so successful is because I got you that
41829380	41831380	Xbox, isn't it? And I'm like, yeah, dad, yeah!
41831380	41833380	Yeah, you made me cool, dad!
41833380	41835380	Yeah! Like, we're hyping each other up.
41835380	41837380	And I'm like, yeah!
41837380	41839380	Um...
41839380	41841380	I was, like, really cute.
41841380	41843380	No, my dad's, like, such a good
41843380	41845380	sport about everything.
41845380	41847380	Um...
41847380	41849380	Like, we're gonna do an interview.
41849380	41851380	Um, and he knows
41851380	41853380	about, like, Vila and that.
41853380	41855380	Um, he was like, how did it go?
41855380	41857380	And I was like, dad, dad!
41857380	41859380	Almost 3,000 people watched
41859380	41861380	me at once in one stream type thing.
41861380	41863380	Um, and he's like, is that
41863380	41865380	good? And I'm like, it's way beyond my
41865380	41867380	world! The streams, all the girls did
41867380	41869380	amazing! And he was like, oh, I'm so
41869380	41871380	glad you're girls are nice to me. And my mom
41871380	41873380	as well.
41873380	41875380	My mom really likes the girls.
41875380	41877380	Never spoken to them.
41877380	41879380	They've never interacted. But my mom's
41879380	41881380	like, oh, I love
41881380	41883380	your girls so much. They're so...
41883380	41885380	Like, send me their links. I want to hear their voices.
41885380	41887380	They send me, like, all this.
41887380	41889380	Like, it's so cute. It's just really nice.
41889380	41891380	Um...
41891380	41893380	Hopefully it doesn't feel like I'm, like,
41893380	41895380	rubbing it in anyone's faces
41895380	41897380	if they maybe have parents that are not
41897380	41899380	quite so understanding.
41899380	41901380	Uh...
41901380	41903380	I really don't want it to sting
41903380	41905380	if I talk about the subject, but I'll
41905380	41907380	move on and we'll
41907380	41909380	see what we're dealing with next. We're going to
41909380	41911380	arrow storm here because
41911380	41913380	we need to unlock
41913380	41915380	the
41915380	41917380	Assassin's Upgrade.
41917380	41919380	We're, uh, right.
41919380	41921380	We're trying by this building. How much time
41921380	41923380	have I got? We've got, like,
41923380	41925380	a cut in it quick.
41925380	41927380	Meracy's not online anymore, is she?
41929380	41931380	Is anyone from Ymir? Oh,
41931380	41933380	I don't want to do that. Please leave me alone. I'm not doing that mission.
41937380	41939380	Meracy's still on. Um, can someone
41939380	41941380	be a kind soul and say
41941380	41943380	Strone's asking if you're still
41943380	41945380	going to be online in 20 minutes?
41945380	41947380	Uh...
41947380	41949380	She should redirect into you or not?
41949380	41951380	Um, and then
41951380	41953380	get back to me if she's still...
41953380	41955380	if she's still doing it or not.
41955380	41957380	We're just going to buy these expensive things now.
41957380	41959380	Um...
41959380	41961380	They're so... they take such a big
41961380	41963380	chunk of the money, though.
41963380	41965380	Literally, I'm back to 32.
41965380	41967380	I think I'm going to have to send my recruits on missions
41967380	41969380	again.
41969380	41971380	Just came back from Shum. Ain't no way she's still going.
41971380	41973380	Ah, yeah.
41973380	41975380	Uh, the only reason
41975380	41977380	I'm going offline in 20 minutes
41977380	41979380	is because of the VOD issues.
41979380	41981380	If there was no VOD issues,
41981380	41983380	we would be doing Leonardo's
41983380	41985380	missions right now.
41985380	41987380	Right now!
41987380	41989380	Right now! Uh, I'm serious when I say that.
41989380	41991380	We'd be on Leonardo. We'd be in
41991380	41993380	a tank right now. We'd be on a
41993380	41995380	paraglider. Okay?
41995380	41997380	But no.
41997380	41999380	No, no, no. Had to...
41999380	42001380	Had to have VOD issues.
42001380	42003380	Yeah, yeah.
42003380	42005380	Right, let's level up these
42005380	42007380	assassinos.
42007380	42009380	Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
42009380	42011380	We've got quite a lot
42011380	42013380	of level 8s. We can probably
42013380	42015380	do quite dangerous
42015380	42017380	missions. I'll send...
42017380	42019380	No, I won't. I'll send
42019380	42021380	two 7s
42021380	42023380	away together.
42023380	42025380	I've got a big one. More 8s.
42025380	42027380	One, two, three, four, five.
42027380	42029380	Oh, you're not even fully successful now.
42029380	42031380	I don't want to risk it. I'll send the 8s
42031380	42033380	on...
42033380	42035380	Yeah, that'll be fine.
42035380	42037380	I'm literally have no worries that
42037380	42039380	they're going to survive.
42039380	42041380	Mm, yeah. I was kind of into
42041380	42043380	that awkward levelling upstage
42043380	42045380	where...
42045380	42047380	I'm not wasting time sending
42047380	42049380	them together, but
42049380	42051380	it would be nice
42051380	42053380	to get the strength to, like, go on
42053380	42055380	their own.
42055380	42057380	YouTube, give us YouTube take away.
42057380	42059380	YouTube can stop me. Literally
42059380	42061380	if I would do 14 hours,
42061380	42063380	I would be doing Leonardo,
42063380	42065380	and then I would be pretty
42065380	42067380	satisfied. Maybe the auditory
42067380	42069380	memories and Christina memory, because
42069380	42071380	that's actually really quick as well.
42071380	42073380	Um,
42073380	42075380	I honestly would love to say
42075380	42077380	I'll make a second stream room, but
42077380	42079380	I do have those 8s in my collabs
42079380	42081380	and those clips to get
42081380	42083380	clipped and edited and that.
42083380	42085380	Oh, I can't believe it. I have responsibility.
42085380	42087380	Who would have imagined
42087380	42089380	that spawning a VTuber agency
42089380	42091380	meant I have responsibilities?
42091380	42093380	Oh! Oh!
42093380	42095380	Truly a shit. Please, excuse me, sir.
42095380	42097380	Um...
42097380	42099380	Oh, what is that? What is it?
42099380	42101380	Uh, right.
42101380	42103380	Um, I don't think I have enough money
42103380	42105380	for, like, anything
42105380	42107380	else.
42107380	42109380	Wait, how much money do I have
42109380	42111380	on my persons?
42111380	42113380	13K, that's not enough
42113380	42115380	to do anything else.
42117380	42119380	We'll arrive at work any day.
42119380	42121380	Can't wait for the birthday placer.
42121380	42123380	Can't wait for yapping 2.0, where I
42123380	42125380	regurgitate all the information. Maybe
42125380	42127380	I should look at the development
42127380	42129380	behind the scenes and then I can tell you about
42129380	42131380	the development behind the scenes.
42131380	42133380	That would be interesting too. What time are we
42133380	42135380	at? I've got 20 minutes.
42135380	42137380	Maybe the bank will...
42137380	42139380	Hmm...
42139380	42141380	Hmm...
42141380	42143380	Right, let's do Christina.
42143380	42145380	Let's do Christina. We've got time.
42145380	42147380	It doesn't take 20 minutes to do her.
42147380	42149380	Oh!
42149380	42151380	That's what she said.
42155380	42157380	I don't know if we'll finish
42157380	42159380	her storyline. I believe she has
42159380	42161380	three missions and the last
42161380	42163380	mission is a punch out.
42163380	42165380	Punch out?
42165380	42167380	But we'll do
42167380	42169380	a? Ah, Christina.
42169380	42171380	Christina mission.
42171380	42173380	I'm claiming
42173380	42175380	the building.
42175380	42177380	Claim me, claim me, claim me.
42177380	42179380	Best I can do is do.
42179380	42181380	Doesn't take to it.
42181380	42183380	Just like,
42183380	42185380	nevermind. I know, I know.
42185380	42187380	I make it too easy. I don't even
42187380	42189380	mean it. If I do it, I don't
42189380	42191380	mean it, but if I do it to you
42191380	42193380	then I mean it.
42193380	42195380	Oh, look how much my armor
42195380	42197380	but my health bar went up. I just
42197380	42199380	like, literally noticed that.
42199380	42201380	How did I not notice that?
42201380	42203380	Cause it's massive.
42205380	42207380	It's like halfway across. It's like
42207380	42209380	the Elden Ring.
42209380	42211380	Oh!
42211380	42213380	Okay, we're getting stole. I see the
42213380	42215380	game is trying to stall me from
42215380	42217380	achieving my...
42217380	42219380	Jesus, that's brutal.
42219380	42221380	Oh, that's brutal.
42221380	42223380	Oh, that's brutal.
42223380	42225380	Is that a new knife as well?
42225380	42227380	I must have unlocked a new knife
42227380	42229380	cause, yeah, this must be a
42229380	42231380	Romuli knife. A Romulus knife.
42231380	42233380	Cause I, that does not look like
42233380	42235380	the default knife.
42235380	42237380	Yeah, with the hook.
42237380	42239380	Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.
42239380	42241380	Tihi! Tihi, I'm just
42241380	42243380	the normal average citizen.
42243380	42245380	Christina!
42245380	42247380	My love!
42247380	42249380	Hello!
42253380	42255380	We'll be climbing a coast with this
42255380	42257380	mission.
42257380	42259380	Does it
42259380	42261380	vaude explode after the 12 hour
42261380	42263380	mark or is it like
42263380	42265380	it gives a few minutes of grace
42265380	42267380	unironically? Cause I'm worried
42267380	42269380	about it exploding.
42269380	42271380	Ha ha!
42275380	42277380	This doesn't take long, it's a punch out.
42277380	42279380	What about that one?
42279380	42281380	That's my brother!
42285380	42287380	This is baby, it's healing.
42299380	42301380	I think it explodes right after
42301380	42303380	12 hours.
42305380	42307380	What?
42307380	42309380	What?
42309380	42311380	Why are you just standing there?
42311380	42313380	Oh, um,
42313380	42315380	because I
42315380	42317380	wanted to ask you
42317380	42319380	which is
42319380	42321380	what's your name?
42321380	42323380	Not one you'll ever meet me
42323380	42325380	without.
42325380	42327380	I wasn't ready.
42327380	42329380	I'm planning on being really charming.
42331380	42333380	Negative riz.
42347380	42349380	Whoa!
42349380	42351380	I have terrible news, please do not
42351380	42353380	take the advice of Ezio.
42353380	42355380	Do not ever follow a woman home.
42355380	42357380	That's not
42357380	42359380	socially acceptable.
42359380	42361380	Don't worry, I'll teach you what's
42361380	42363380	socially acceptable and what's not.
42363380	42365380	If you approach a woman
42365380	42367380	and then
42367380	42369380	she, you know,
42369380	42371380	doesn't reciprocate interest,
42371380	42373380	do not follow
42373380	42375380	a woman home. That is no-no
42375380	42377380	in society.
42377380	42379380	More societal,
42379380	42381380	social...
42381380	42383380	Oh! See?
42385380	42387380	Wait, get back here.
42387380	42389380	Oh my god, she wants me for real, for real.
42389380	42391380	That's how you get a restraining order.
42391380	42393380	Yeah, this is...
42393380	42395380	I understand it's a video game,
42395380	42397380	but
42397380	42399380	this is...
42399380	42401380	Yeah.
42403380	42405380	Yeah, this is...
42407380	42409380	Yeah, this is...
42411380	42413380	something alright.
42415380	42417380	Like,
42417380	42419380	I know Ezio's harmless,
42419380	42421380	but this is... it's given, like,
42421380	42423380	yandere simulator or something.
42425380	42427380	Like, that kind of negative thing.
42429380	42431380	Restraining order speed run for real.
42433380	42435380	The best thing you think of to get around 12-hour
42435380	42437380	problem is to close the stream when you...
42437380	42439380	Oh, I wasn't paying attention, sorry, I was reading chat.
42439380	42441380	12-hour problem is
42441380	42443380	to close...
42443380	42445380	to close
42445380	42447380	the stream when you have to take a long
42447380	42449380	break and start a new one after.
42449380	42451380	Okay.
42451380	42453380	Do you mean, like, actually go offline and rest
42453380	42455380	and then come back online again? Is that your solution
42455380	42457380	to my 12-hour stream problem?
42459380	42461380	Instruction's unclear, I'm hiding in her closet.
42461380	42463380	Oh!
42463380	42465380	That's terrible!
42465380	42467380	You're not to make those jokes!
42467380	42469380	That's naughty!
42469380	42471380	Oh.
42471380	42473380	Okay, this quest has taken
42473380	42475380	a bit longer than I originally anticipated.
42479380	42481380	But I think we're about to do the fighting
42481380	42483380	part and then we're done.
42483380	42485380	You achieved 100%
42485380	42487380	in problem
42487380	42489380	solving.
42489380	42491380	Okay, we're here, we're here, we end this.
42493380	42495380	We hate him!
42501380	42503380	I think not, I'm already here.
42503380	42505380	I've decided, I'm tired
42505380	42507380	of waiting for you to open your legs
42507380	42509380	on your own.
42517380	42519380	Oh, the area, I thought his name was Duccio
42519380	42521380	for some reason.
42521380	42523380	Oh my god, we're the knight in
42523380	42525380	training armor, we're not creepy anymore
42525380	42527380	because we're saving her.
42527380	42529380	Take this!
42529380	42531380	Leave the lady alone!
42539380	42541380	Thank you.
42541380	42543380	That was very kind of you.
42543380	42545380	Are you alright?
42545380	42547380	Not only is her...
42547380	42549380	I'm sorry.
42555380	42557380	He looks like such a baby there, honestly.
42557380	42559380	Looks like you got yourself a second chance.
42563380	42565380	If she kisses and not even
42565380	42567380	on the first date,
42567380	42569380	we're in, lads.
42569380	42571380	We're in, lads.
42571380	42573380	We are in.
42575380	42577380	You stalking wha- No!
42577380	42579380	No!
42579380	42581380	Absolutely not!
42583380	42585380	Absolutely not!
42585380	42587380	This is fictional game.
42587380	42589380	Literally when you build up the game,
42589380	42591380	it says fiction.
42591380	42593380	Okay, I think
42593380	42595380	I'm gonna have to close the game there
42595380	42597380	because the void
42597380	42599380	is literally about to explode.
42599380	42601380	Did you guys tell me if
42601380	42603380	Mercy is still strumming?
42603380	42605380	They'll be strumming her in a minute.
42605380	42607380	Stop!
42607380	42609380	Stop.
42609380	42611380	Unappropriate.
42611380	42613380	No HR though.
42613380	42615380	Mercy is still on.
42615380	42617380	She's still gonna keep playing.
42617380	42619380	She's still gonna...
42619380	42621380	Remember that time donations were on?
42621380	42623380	And then you guys broke the donations so badly
42623380	42625380	that no one in Vehler can get donated to right now?
42625380	42627380	Because you guys were so supportive.
42627380	42629380	Yeah, she's still yapping.
42629380	42631380	She's post-game yapping.
42631380	42633380	Alright, well...
42635380	42637380	I'm gonna get her link.
42637380	42639380	Mercy, can I get your link?
42639380	42641380	Mercy, can I get your link?
42641380	42643380	Mercy, can I get your link?
42643380	42645380	That's how I spell Mercy Modest.
42645380	42647380	That's right.
42647380	42649380	What are you gonna do about it?
42649380	42651380	Are you gonna fart?
42651380	42653380	Yeah, that's right.
42653380	42655380	You're not gonna fart.
42655380	42657380	You're gonna do nothing about it.
42657380	42659380	Come on.
42659380	42661380	Stop it!
42661380	42663380	Analytics? No, wrong one.
42663380	42665380	Details. Customization.
42665380	42667380	Redirect.
42667380	42669380	I'm gonna link right in there.
42669380	42671380	Save.
42671380	42673380	Okay, when I end, it should redirect
42673380	42675380	into...
42675380	42677380	this encyclopedia
42677380	42679380	of Would You Want to Quit the Game?
42679380	42681380	Righty-hoo!
42681380	42683380	Should I go bigger?
42685380	42687380	Hold on a minute.
42689380	42691380	Why is chat wrong?
42691380	42693380	Chat isn't disabled!
42697380	42699380	Well...
42699380	42701380	What is this?
42701380	42703380	Why the heck?
42703380	42705380	You know what?
42705380	42707380	I'll just stand here then.
42707380	42709380	Hi!
42709380	42711380	I say hi
42711380	42713380	if we're not all about to go a bit.
42713380	42715380	Thank you all so much
42715380	42717380	for letting me go
42717380	42719380	turbo mode on this game.
42719380	42721380	It has been nothing short of a pleasure
42721380	42723380	and I hope
42723380	42725380	we can 100%
42725380	42727380	tomorrow.
42727380	42729380	I don't know what the tank mission is.
42729380	42731380	I don't know if I should look it up
42731380	42733380	or if I should just
42733380	42735380	wish myself good luck on the tank.
42735380	42737380	But yes.
42737380	42739380	Thank you for hanging.
42739380	42741380	Please don't worry if you weren't here for the full thing.
42741380	42743380	I don't think anyone was here for the full thing
42743380	42745380	other than me.
42745380	42747380	Please.
42747380	42749380	I miss her already!
42749380	42751380	I'm still talking!
42751380	42753380	Have I even gone yet?
42753380	42755380	We are 52 minutes
42755380	42757380	so less than 7 minutes.
42757380	42759380	I'm stinky.
42759380	42761380	I'm going to end it
42761380	42763380	so it can successfully raid into Mercy.
42763380	42765380	But thank you so much
42765380	42767380	for keeping me company.
42767380	42769380	I'm so glad I got to share one of the...
42769380	42771380	one of the? No.
42771380	42773380	The greatest game
42773380	42775380	of all time.
42775380	42777380	I have no idea how long tomorrow
42777380	42779380	the stream is going to be.
42779380	42781380	But really
42781380	42783380	we pretty much done everything other than
42783380	42785380	Leonardo missions and then we just go back
42785380	42787380	in the DNA sequences
42787380	42789380	of the chapters we messed up
42789380	42791380	and by we messed up I messed up
42791380	42793380	but I'm putting the blame on the both of us.
42793380	42795380	Okay?
42795380	42797380	Um...
42797380	42799380	Can you give us a peek at those eyes before you hop off
42799380	42801380	as encouragement for showing up?
42801380	42803380	Oh go go go! I like it.
42803380	42805380	I dig it. Ah, new subscriber
42805380	42807380	you're in the way.
42807380	42809380	You're such a silly goober up there, new subscriber.
42809380	42811380	How do I get rid of you?
42811380	42813380	Just for now.
42813380	42815380	Okay.
42815380	42817380	You ready?
42817380	42819380	Even though my Assassin's Creed sounds are still
42819380	42821380	in the background? Just pretend the backing
42821380	42823380	track to the menu of Assassin's Creed
42823380	42825380	is Hypnosis space, okay?
42825380	42827380	Wow.
42827380	42829380	You want to come to stream tomorrow, don't you?
42831380	42833380	I'll be waiting.
42833380	42835380	And you've done very well today.
42835380	42837380	Holding on for
42837380	42839380	too long.
42839380	42841380	Can you do it again
42841380	42843380	tomorrow for me?
42843380	42845380	Yeah?
42845380	42847380	Fine then.
42847380	42849380	I'll see you tomorrow.
42849380	42851380	Nya!
42851380	42853380	But for now
42853380	42855380	you can meme in me, okay?
42855380	42857380	You can meme in me.
42857380	42859380	Okay.
42859380	42861380	Thank you so so much.
42861380	42863380	We're gonna go to Mercy.
42863380	42865380	Should have picked
42865380	42867380	any kind of support.
42867380	42869380	Right. I love you so so much, Reflings.
42869380	42871380	And if you're not Reflinging
42871380	42873380	don't worry, I still love you too
42873380	42875380	because I'm really appreciate you hanging out.
42875380	42877380	I know some people don't like being referred to
42877380	42879380	as Fannins, but I like Reflings.
42879380	42881380	No.
42881380	42883380	Not that.
42883380	42885380	Reflings.
42889380	42891380	I'll see you tomorrow.
42891380	42893380	Bye bye. I go sleep and brush my teeth.
42893380	42895380	No, I brush my teeth first and then I go sleep.
42895380	42897380	But first,
42897380	42899380	Mercy.
42899380	42901380	I'll then brush teeth.
