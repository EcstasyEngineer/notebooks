00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Mummy, the mummy hasn't abandoned no thing.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Mummy is in a foolish, foolish streamer.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
When I did the footstream, I put my ring light.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
I had to move my ring light so I could elimp the shit and put it down to the wall.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
As it eliminate that mummy started streaming on her hands and knees, it's not what she did.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
I need the ring light.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
The thing that is flashing is the goofy and it's jumping about everywhere.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
It went on and on.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
So that is going to be the light.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Please, it's the only light.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Okay.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Alright, my face is eliminated.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm also on reactive mode so I'm actually going to react to the game.

00:54.000 --> 01:04.000
Everyone knows I have an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 with 10,067 megabits.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Hello, good morning.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Let me put it on.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Live chat.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Any live chatter?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I apologize if I sound tired.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
I passed out after that RuneScape stream and I woke up 45 minutes ago.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
I hope Icy's monetization stream went fantastic.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I believe Emmys is also today.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
So if there's any pin pals or snowberries, they're down the hall.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Into the lift.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I apologize if I sound tired.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I am exhausted.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
I don't know how.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I slept for so long.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I don't know what is going on with me.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
But I've got cup of tea.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I've got two waters.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I've got a wee muffin.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
And then we can jump into Crash Bandicoot.

02:06.000 --> 02:18.000
As for any updates, since I slept, I have absolutely nothing.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
A refling sent me a three page story, which I really liked.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
But for legal reasons, I cannot speak any of it here.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
I've also put together a little folder of BibBits.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Which I don't know why I didn't think to do it earlier.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
But now I'm putting it all together.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh and a refling sent me a five minute audio.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And he was like, talk!

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
I was like, oh my god, reflings are getting so brave, honestly.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
And before I die a lot, probably, probably, I'm not even going to put it behind me.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
I don't know what level the desktop, how loud the game is going to be compared to me.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
But give me a three page story.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
It was about me, obviously.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
But yes, you guys have been doing fantastic.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I believe AC has done well.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I don't really have any updates about anything else at the moment.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Other than my freaking ASMR meme video, I've got 30k views.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And I'm like, right, this has definitely left the target audience.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Because I had 5,000 subscribers when I posted that.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
And now we're at 6,000.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm like, bruv, that like propelled my channel.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
So I'm waiting, Mercy's is going to go up after this stream.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
Or, or it's going to go up after she finishes her stream today.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
And then AC's is ready to go up.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
I may actually, I'm going to message her right now so she can reply to me.

04:00.000 --> 04:11.000
And see, when you finished stream, do you want me to upload your meme ASMR on your behalf question mark?

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
And before you're like, wait, why are you asking the girls permission to do stuff that you made for them?

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Because it's their channels.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I don't want them to be unhappy.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I want them to be happy little ducklings with me.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Who up?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Bandy their cooter.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Whoa.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm getting a bit too close to that one.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Any Bandy cooters?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It's only such a sweetheart.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Yes, I don't want to do anything that upsets the girls.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
And if they're like, no, now's not the time to upload the meme ASMR.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
That's fine.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
So I'll get permission from them and then possibly after the stream.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Apparently it takes eight hours to do this game.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Now, I'ma just say, I was a atom when I played this game.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I have barely any recollection.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
My dad didn't buy it for me.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
He bought it for himself.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Johnny, congrats on 6.5k.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
No, I owe so many ASMR videos.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I was going to try and get my first thank you video out.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Oh.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Well, maybe after buckshot roulette after the doc.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Because I've got buckshot roulette.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Then I've got a couple hours.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Then I go to the doctor.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Is this a rhythm game?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
It is not.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's Crash Bandicoot.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
It is an adventure platformer.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I know you can't hear the background of the game right now.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
So it's just my voice in this room.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Do forgive.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Strongly winning a game.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Any ganky desks?

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Hold on, let me hydrate with my tea.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I owe so much ASMR.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I do have it all recorded.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I just need to sit and edit it.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
And I can't upload the clapping without using my hands ASMR.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Yet, I need to have some things in between it.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Strongly winning much and everything right.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It's a never ending move.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Every time she releases an ASMR, she gains 1k and she gets to go back to square one.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Honestly, I'm like, I hope not.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I think it will definitely calm down a bit.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
It's going to have to calm down.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Because as much as our capitalist overlords love infinite growth,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
that's just not plausible here.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Nor is it something that is healthy or thingy.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Because if you start measuring yourself by numbers and that kind of thing,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
that's when, I think that's when VJubers probably get it in their head.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
They're like, oh, I'm not doing well enough.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm not performing well enough.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And it's like, Brev, you haven't even given yourself a chance.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Just have fun.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
People can tell you're sweating on trends if you're trying to sweat on trends, you know?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And then people can tell when you're just meaming around,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
when you're just meaming around, you know?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
And guess what?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
You know, some streamers, sorry, this has just turned into a philosophical,

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
let's digest and get to the roots of why streamers are streamers.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Some people are just, what's the word,

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
optimized to have a nice, cosy, tight-knit community.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Okay?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Some people, some of your personalities, other streamers,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
you're just supposed to have a nice little tight-knit community.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You're not supposed to be for the masses, you know?

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
So don't always be reaching for the fricking stratosphere, the stars.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Don't always be reaching for the stars when you do just fine in the stratosphere, you know?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Every time you gain 1k, you release an ASMR that gains you 1k.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
So it's an infinite feedback loop you'll be at.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Infinity subs by the end of the week.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Not quite.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Especially those looking to extract numbers from TikTok that only have 100 subs,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
but say they deserve a million views on every post.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Yes.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
I can actually get into the psychology on why people feel they deserve subscribers,

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
versus others who feel unworthy of what they get because of what they've done.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
I could definitely go on an algorithm stream that in, not tinfoil time,

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
no it's not tinfoil, it's not tinfoil, it's not tinfoil.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
It's like human psychology as well as the damage that the internet does to the mind.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Cos if you didn't know, you're actually not supposed to be exposed to,

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
I think you're not supposed to actually know more than 100 faces at once,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
and your brain is just not wired for any other way.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
After that, your brain can only be wired to recognise tribes, which sounds terrible,

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
but that's just how it is, so it's like, ah, I am approaching the AC clan, you know?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Or the tribe.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Are you studying psychology?

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Absolutely not, I have had enough of education.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I say that, I might be going back to beauty school,

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
but that's for, I'm talking like five years down the line beauty school type thing,

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
because I might want to run an ASMR room studio type thing,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
but that's just me, that's just me.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Need a tinfoil hat or more?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
For the reflins?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Honestly, I'm so down for that.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I need the meds to moat back, I need the thigh gripper moat back,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
all other emotes that I need back.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
I was actually going to ask if a refling has any batch to emotes,

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
so wink wink, if you could send me a cat box file of the batch itself,

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
so I know what to reorder, because I picked what I wanted.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Just so you know, just so we're all on the same, I picked what I wanted.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh yeah, Crash Bandicoot 3.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Yes, so I was but an atom and my dad bought this game for himself,

09:57.000 --> 10:04.000
and the only thing I remember doing on this game is playing Coco on China

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
and using the horse all the time.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
The horse, the tiger all the time.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
I'll have to catch stream later as I'm working on eight slides of insurance termed out.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Even the thought of that is terrible.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
I don't know what's going on with my teas, I've not been enjoying them as of late.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm getting a bit nervous, I'm getting a bit shaky why I'm not enjoying my teas,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
because normally I'm all over them.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Although I have been enjoying this fruit juice company thing,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
and they put loads of fruit in the juice, and then they juice it,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
and then I drink the juice, and then I get all the goodness in me.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
I've had too many teas, this is a very plausible and realistic sense.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Although I've only had one tea the day, I'll literally only, I woke up like,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
well I woke up an hour ago now,

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
woke up, spammed the PC on, started spamming pre-chat for a few moments,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
checked out AC to see what's going on with her, she's fine,

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
checked out the Discord to see if the girls are fine, they're fine,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
refueling, slacking flavour lately.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
You're not enjoying the tea because it's all just special, aren't you?

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Oh my god, it sounds terrible, but should I just get a cola?

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
I don't think drinking a cola first thing in the morning is a good idea though.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
It's a terrible idea.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Okay, let's get into Crash Bandicoot.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Any Crash Bandicooters?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Is that too loud? Or is that fine?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Oh my god.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
How do I leave? Oh, my controller isn't even awake, hold on.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah, plug my controller in.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
So there's three games in it, I've only ever played Warped,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't know what the other two are about.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Hey, I guess the game.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Override save.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Is it too loud?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Guys, groovy as anything, maybe turn it down a little.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay, I'll do it in the start menu after the cutscene.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Oh, we're crashing?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Oh, I guess we are called Crash Bandicoot.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Thank you.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Oh my god, that's so beautiful.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Oh, it kinda looks like a Snow Berry.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Snow Berry.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Oh my god, this is so beautiful, this game.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
It was that Infernal Bandicoot.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Bandicoot.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Oh, wait, it's a Tiki Mask, like Earth Tiki Mask guy.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Okay.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
What?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Insane.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Oh, I don't remember any of this.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Whoa, fuck it.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Oh, that was a flashbang first thing in the morning.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Did you see that?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I can't see anymore.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Oh my god, this game is so beautiful and cool.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
For real, I think I just got a virus.

14:59.000 --> 15:10.000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, I remember something like that.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh my gosh, that was so beautiful.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Wait, hold on.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I need to turn down the volume a little bit.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
My apologies.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
Game options, music, 8.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Wait.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, I could do this all day.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
We'll do 8s.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh my god.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Oh, wait, you can't control the camera angle.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
What does Y do?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Y shows me my light, what does B do?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
No.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Oh my god, POV, I'm coming for AC.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
I'm a snowberry going for AC.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Oh my god, on the prowl, on the prowl.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I'm an Oji-san.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Come to me, AC, my princess.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Daddy wants...

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Oh my god, this is so precious.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
This is so cool.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Oh my god, wait, I remember these symbols a little bit.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
No.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
I mean, it's more powerful because I'm the goodie.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
You're the baddie.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Oh my god, right.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Where does this work?

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Oh my god.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Oh my god, this is like, you can...

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Oh my god, we flints, we're already on the farm.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
10 out of 10 game, we're already on the farm.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Wait, how do I do that?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
To jump to spin to crutch for inventory.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Why would I need to see my inventory?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I guess if you're going for like 100%, but...

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Oh my god, we can bomb.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
This game is beautiful.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Don't remember that.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Does that need to hurt it?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Oh no, we spanked it.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Right, we spanked it.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
We didn't kill it.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
We spanked it away.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Okay, it's fine.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Oh god.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Oh my god.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Oh no, thank you for the 5.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Okay, I can definitely take fall damage.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Oh my...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Checkpoint.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm remembering.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Wait, go back on the farm.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Go back on the farm.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
What does this do?

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Okay, if you hit it at a certain time.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Oh my god, we're on the farm.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Right, frogs.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Frogs can hurt us.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Go back on the farm, where you belong.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Oh my god, I can spank everyone.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Oh, I love this game.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Wait, how about if I get two of the good bookers?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh, he's glowing.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Oh, you are glowing.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
What the heck is it?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
What did I do?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Where am I going?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Oh no.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
What's this?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh, it's bone.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I got an achievement for doing this.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It's a bonus level.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Wow.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Is this just like free apples?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh my apples.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I never picked them up.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Oh my god, that's so cool.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Fa la la la la la la.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Who's farm the dream?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
The bleeding hearts are getting spanked.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
For real, for real.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
A wimper fruit.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
A wimper fruit.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
One puff, one puff fruit.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Go back to the farm.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Oh, we trick shot it with the bleeding heart.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
We trick shot it.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Go back to the farm.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
No frog for gen two.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
Oh my god, Shibi really wants a slim girl for gen two.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I don't know how to break it to her.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
She really wants a gen two.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
I'm just like, maybe I'll give Shibi a Halloween outfit.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Wait, have we already been here before?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Or is this just kind of the same layout?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Okay, and spank.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
What?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
It's pink.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Why is there a gap in this bridge?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
No slim girl?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
No, maybe I'll give Shibi a slim Halloween outfit.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
How about that?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Slim girls.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I get it.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
What?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Oh, wait, so if you miss it, you'll...

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Okay.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I missed a box.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Stinky, I don't know where it was.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Slim girls are my favorite monster girl.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh, but slimes are hot.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm not sure.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
I don't know.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh, they came out of my ear hole.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Oops.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
And then we just go back in Indra too.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Oh my god, that's cool.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
This game is easy.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I like how fun and easy it is here.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Lamia's are my favorite.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I would entertain a Lamia.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Oh, the fisher thing.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
To kick fast.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Whoa!

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Whoa!

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Okay, wait, that was very dumb.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Sorry, that was incredibly dumb.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Whoa, this game's so pretty.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Sorry, I've not got much accuracy under the war,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
even though I'm a cuttlefish.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
I know.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I don't want to...

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Did I just like go past them?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Wait, that's a checkpoint.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Oh my gosh!

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I remember something like this.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I used to be so scared of it as a child.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I thought I only remembered Coco.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I can hear a box back there.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Wait, what does that shark do?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Please email him.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Oh, there's a sand dollar.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
On the ground.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Whoa, there's...

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Jeez, this game is so cute.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I can't believe I didn't play this before.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Well, I mean...

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Sorry, I got scared.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I don't know if I can hurt those pufferfish.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Checkpoint.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Checkpoint.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Why checkpoint?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
What's here that shouldn't be here?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Is there something below that's going to kill me?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Because why did I get a checkpoint?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
You can switch to play Coco.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Oh!

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Oh my gosh.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
What?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
No wonder this game did so good.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
It's like so creative.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Bomb, bomb, bomb.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Oh, there's hidden boxes under the coral rays.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
That's okay.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
We're not going for 100%

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
because I don't know how to 100% this game.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
But we can go for lots of fruit.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Probably yummy yummy fruit.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Oh, I can beat shark up in this.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
And I can explode things in this.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Let's go.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Oh no, I broke it.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
I'm sorry.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
I'm a bit of a klutz.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
I accidentally broke it.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Bomb, bomb, bomb.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh wait, that's not the song anymore.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
It's whatever the underwater.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Oh!

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Sure, we'll get these boxes.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
I think it's safe enough.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh my god.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
What do you mean I'm so in love with a game

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
that's got the difficulty for literal children?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
I can't believe it.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
The accusations are unfounded.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
I play Skyrim on Legendary mode

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
just because you can.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
It doesn't mean you need to be...

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Wait, can I hurt this?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Oh no, I can beat up the little puffer fish.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Oh, the purple puffers.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Okay, there we go.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Whoa, there's the prank crystal.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Okay, let's get it.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Wait, is that going to explode?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Oh wow!

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Oh, if you don't do it in time,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
it becomes a solid.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Okay, that's curious.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Is it hard to get 100%?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Oh, I missed a lot of boxes this time.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Didn't do that good this time.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
But it's okay.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I'm happy just loving everything.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
The scene reminds me so much of Jack and Dax, though.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Jack and Dax.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Oh, I threw that one up this time,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
so it doesn't always come out your ear.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Wee!

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
The Orient Express.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Coco!

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Oh, this is the mission!

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Oh my god, this is the mission.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Ah!

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Coco!

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
And we're for the Tigers.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
They missed!

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Oh my god!

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Oh my god!

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Oh my god!

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Oh my god!

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I know it's like first thing in the morning,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
but I'm so happy!

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Oh my god!

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
This is the mission that I always remember

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
from childhood.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Oh my god!

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Go, Coco!

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Go, Coco!

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
You're doing it!

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Oh, you're so beautiful!

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Oh my god!

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
It's the music!

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Get it, get it!

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Oh my god!

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Get it, get it, get it!

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Yes!

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Oh no, I hurt myself.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Oh, I didn't know what I was supposed to do there.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
I forgot.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I forgot, but I got a checkpoint, so it's okay.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Oh, I jumped into it!

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Coco, no!

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
No!

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Oh, but it's okay.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
The Tiger forgives me for being a terrible driver.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Oh, I did it again!

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Oh shit!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Stop jumping!

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
What happens?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh, okay.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
No more jumping.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
No jumpies.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Jumpies, no.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
But no jumpies.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And then big boy jumpies.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Oh, I missed.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
What the heck?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I was so close.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Oh, if I run ahead, I can attack.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Run!

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Tiger!

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Oh, how can you?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Oh no!

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
It's so bad!

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Oh my god!

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Wait, what happens if I run out of lives?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Is it over?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Is it over for me?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
This is over for me?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Wait, can I just run ahead and hurt them?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Whee!

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Whoa, that was a freaking leap and a half!

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Call me Joe Leeper,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
because one Tiger run is all it takes.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Whee!

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Oh my god!

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
That's such a good mission!

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Oh, my little Tizer!

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
Soft, giddy, warm, giddy, little ball of fluff.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Oh, that's the best mission in the entire game.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Okay, we can end stream now.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
That's all we needed to do.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
That's all we needed to do.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I don't know what the diamond is.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Right, what we got next.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
The Boneyard!

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
There are like three more of that?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Oh my god!

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
What?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Oh no!

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Neurons activated from childhood.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Oh no!

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
I think I get chased this entire mission!

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Oh no!

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Oh no, there's lava everywhere!

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
It's jumping faster!

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Oh, I don't know, I'm jumping faster!

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Oh my god!

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Wait, why did you do that?

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Crash, crash!

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Crash, why did you do that?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Crash, jump, crash!

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Crash, you need to jump like double jump!

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Whoa, wait, I can't do it!

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Wait, can I just stay here forever in the tower?

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Is that a Tyrannosaurus talk or something like that?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Wait, why can I not jump that?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Can you double jump it again?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Oh, is it that?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Jump, spin?

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Whoa, I could hardly get over that!

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Oh no!

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
I can't believe it, childhood me strikes again!

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Can I not double jump?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Hold the jump!

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Hold the jump?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
What the heck?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
I'm not going to make it!

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I'm going to run out of life!

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Oh no!

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Wait!

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Wait, it's not doing anything!

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Hold on, let's practice.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump!

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Jump?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I don't know how to double jump.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
It's not letting me double jump.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Oh, it is letting me double jump.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Wait, but I jumped right into it!

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
Oh my god, it's so over and the stream hasn't even freaking started!

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I can't figure it double jump.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Is my input wrong?

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
I'm holding A on my controller.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
There is no double jump.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
He is...

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I'm getting so confused.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Is this a child's game or not?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Answer me!

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Is this game for kids to complete or not?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
It's not looking good.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Can't even get through the first freaking jump!

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Dash jump is one way.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
It's for kids.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
I'm getting filtered by level 3 actually.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I don't know how to do it.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
I'm like trying to extend the jump.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
But there's nothing to extend it.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
It's just a street magma jump!

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
You unlock double jump after beating a boss.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
Wait, so leave and then go to beat a boss and come back?

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Are you holding your jump button down instead of tapping?

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
If I tap, hold, tap.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Holding, tapping.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Right, hold A.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Holding A.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Fuck!

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Holding A.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
This is me holding A!

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
Okay, it just seems to be like so tiny and slate.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Like minuscule.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Right, this is the furthest I've ever got.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Don't mess up now.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Don't mess up now.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Okay, I need a breather honestly.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Alright, I'm just going to keep going.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Oh my god!

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Why was that so hot?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Oh, that's TNT!

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
That's more TNT!

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
They explode!

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Okay, we did it.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
Oh gee, willikers, I sure hope we don't have to do that segment again,

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
because what the heck, why was that so hard?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I literally have no double jump open.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
You should try jumping over them.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Timing matters.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
What's this?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Oh, a platform?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I don't have access to it.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Go away, you scared me.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Oh my god, it's discord nature!

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Did this...

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
What does that do?

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
Okay, well, I remember what it does now.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Wait, can I do this?

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
Go away, you're so creepy!

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Where are you?

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Oh, bonus time, bonus time!

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
That's what it does.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Don't touch the nature.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
No discord daddies.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
No discord groomers in the velar.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Good luck.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Bounce?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Bounce?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Oh my god, free life!

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Well, I definitely needed that after how...

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Why is he so slow when he crouches?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Okay, I like the bonus distance.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Where's the key?

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
I tried to tap crouch when walking to get faster.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Tap crouch while walking.

31:55.000 --> 32:00.000
Oh, every hundred apples, I get a life.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
Ah, those things are so scary.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Exclamation mark.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
What the heck did I just do?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Oh no, I was supposed to jump.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I missed the jump.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
I was supposed to jump on top of the moku.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I don't like this camera angle.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
No, this is why I didn't like the camera angle.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It felt like I was going to get chased again.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Okay, give me the checkpoint at least.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Oh, there's...

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Gate the way up.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
No, no, no!

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Wait, what was that?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Crash? Crash?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Did you just stand on lava and let me win?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Oh my God, the game feels so bad for me.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
That is letting me win.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It feels so bad for me.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Please don't slow me down.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Oh my God, get me out of here.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Oh, get me out of here.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
I'm not playing this level again.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Wampa roots, they're wampas.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Sorry.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Oh my God, the game felt so bad it let me walk on lava.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Oh, that came up more.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Honestly, me right now.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Did I do four there?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Yes, I did.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Right, we're not playing that one again.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
That one was stinky.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
We're doing five.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
We're doing...

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Oh, Coco!

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
What's this one?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Making waves.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Course...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Huh?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
To accelerate, right trigger.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
There's no backwards.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Oh my God, it's so wobbly, wobbly!

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Whee!

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Jump shot!

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Oh my God, this is...

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Oh, there's a bomba.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Wait, wait, let me get the bomba.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Trick shot, trick shot, trick shot, trick shot.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Oh, 360.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I missed fast, okay.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
360!

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
She's actually doing spins.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I'm not doing any input for her to do those spins, by the way.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I'm just jumping on it.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh, there's bombas!

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Bomba!

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Oh no, I've only got seven lives.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Oh well, I just regained a new one.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Okay.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
This is a child's game.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Children can play this, so I can play this.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
For I too, I'm wise enough to play a child's game.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Surely.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Surely I won't have to run out of lives.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
If I play the same game,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
like same level over and over,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
did I just get infinite lives?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Because we might have to farm lives

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
unironically.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Right, hold on, what's going on here?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
No, yes, yes.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Okay, we made it, and we're going to get this checkpoint.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Excuse me?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I said we're going to get this checkpoint.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Coco!

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Oh my god.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Edging me right now.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Wow!

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Oh, that was close, that was close.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I was a bit too close for comfort.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Timon's going to be fine.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Oh, there's a seagull!

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
Slow it down, slow it down.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Slow and steady, when's the race?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Do I need to go 100 miles per minute?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Wah!

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Honestly?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Good game.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I am going to drop it to the bomb!

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
But I didn't, because I'm so

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
emotional at this child's game.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Wah!

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Oh, there's two bombs, that's cheeky.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
The devs did that for a reason.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
They knew I was going to be greedy

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
and go for the bomba.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Hello?

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Okay.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Holy crap, I was like, can I even

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
go near that at all?

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
Steady, easy, easy.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Take it easy.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Steady.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I'd say someone steady wins the race, but sometimes

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
sometimes you're going to just send it

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
and get out of here.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Oh my god.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Oh, this is so good.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Who suggested this game?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Congrats on you if you suggested it.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Just kidding, I picked it, because it's a child's

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
game.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Okay.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
The boss fight!

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Oh no!

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Tiny Tiger.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Oh no.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Am I going to get perished by a boss?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Crash.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Stole the pretty crystals.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Tiny, take them back.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Excalibur Arena.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Sometimes here.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Oh no.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
All the music is banging though.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Oh no.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
MonkaS.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
MonkaS, what'd I do?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Ah!

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Please leave me alone.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Oh my god, he's got J's on like me.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Spank!

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
One and three, one and three, we follow.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
What does that mean?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
What does that mean?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
There's Tigers!

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I'm to avoid

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
everything.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Uh,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
what?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I'm to avoid all those Tigers?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Right, Spank

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
and then Tigers. Right, we can do this.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
We can do this.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Okay, take your time.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Uh-huh.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Uh-huh.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Oh yeah, uh-huh.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Oh yeah, uh-huh.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Okay, okay, I just got a little call

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
up in the last one.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Okay, just keep running.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Just keep running, just keep running.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Spank!

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
And then we do it all over again.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Okay.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Okay.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
This is so much faster than the second phase.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
But that's okay!

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Okay.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Okay, okay, just keep running.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Just keep running around. He'll come to me.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
We did it, we're doing it, we're doing it,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
we're doing it, we're doing it.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Spank!

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Oh, we did it! Oh, what did we get?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
What is this?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Oh, that's a boo!

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Tomato, tomato, boo!

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Beat him while he's down, beat him while he's down!

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Ah!

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Take this.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Oh, okay, what is this?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Supercharged Body Slam.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
For a more professional belly flop, press A

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
and B

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
to the top of the jump.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Please!

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I love this so much!

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Oh, that's so good, I love it!

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Momay Domination.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Dang straight.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Dang straight!

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Well done, children.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
By defeating Tiny,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
you have unlocked the gate to the next time travel area.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Go back to the center

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
of this time, Trister,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
and save your progress if you wish.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
From there, you will see

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
that the gate to the second time travel area

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
is now open.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Okay!

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Thank you!

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Okay.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Okay, so I've unlocked everything in this one.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
In the castle segment.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
How do I save the game?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Left trigger, save.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Uh, sure.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Oh, auto-save is already active.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
That's fine.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Yeah, just save that though.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Yeah, okay.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Just in case.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Um, um, um, um, um.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
What is this?

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
So we've got Arabia,

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
China,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Egypt,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
the future,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
South Korea then,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
for the future.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Tiny Spiny!

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I would just like to formally say that I,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Tiny Spiny,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
am not associated with Tiny Tiny in any way,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
and do not endorse his actions.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
No.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
It's going so good!

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I love it!

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Wow, Bejinga!

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Thank you for the five gifted memberships.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
It means you get access to the emotes.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I'm going to very quickly grab

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
a can of cola.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I'll be literally in those seconds,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
because I couldn't finish my tea, so

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I'll just get cola.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Surely the caffeine will wake me up.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Sure.

40:47.000 --> 40:55.000
My question

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
is,

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
surely not all commissions are that short,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
because there's only five locations,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and if there's only five locations,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I don't,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I think they were going to be finished with

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
gaming two hours and,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
and redirect him into Sheevy,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
because there's no way.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Thank you for the gifted membership,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Bejinga, and thank you for

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
the tip,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
TinySpainE.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
They're short, but you'll die a lot.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
What happens if I get zero lives?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Like, I genuinely lose?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
This is called

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
G-Wiz

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Why? Why must you continue to be

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
a thorn in our sight?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Who? What?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Where was I?

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Oh, Tiny was a good

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
fellow.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
He hated everyone and everything,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
but a good heart,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
nonetheless.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Please be more reasonable with my minions

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
next time.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
It deletes your save file?

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Am I being trolled right now,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
or do I genuinely lose all progress?

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Because this is an old game,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
and that's exactly what old games did.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
They make you lose your, well,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
go back to the farm!

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Go back to the farm!

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Back to the farm!

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Oh!

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Belly Float!

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Okay.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Wow!

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Oh!

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
We know...

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
the way I absolutely decimated that

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
poor man.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
It's not that old. You just lose your score

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
and start from your latest level.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Oh!

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
A game over. The player is given the option

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
to either restart the game from the beginning of the level,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
checkpoint not counted,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
with the standard number of lives, four,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
or to quit to the title screen.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Okay.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
So I don't lose all my Puegue.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
That's good, because if I lost all my progress,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
we're actually going to play

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
a game called Conquer's Bad Fur Day,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
but Conquer's Bad Fur Day

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
is so old that

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
you... Oh my god, I like got a trickshot there.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
It's so old that you lose your progress

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
if you

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
mess up.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
So I'm going to try and win Conquer's Bad Fur Day,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
but I actually have terrible news.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I don't know if I can win it.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Go back on the farm! Both of you!

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
You've been getting so distracted playing...

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Oh.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Go away.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Ah, not me!

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I don't like meages, go away.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Chicken!

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Go! Checkpoint!

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Ah, this game is so good.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
It doesn't even... How do you not blow up that nature?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
As if it's not right next to you.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Oh my god, Crash!

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Oh my shoes!

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
No!

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I got too excited.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I need to unlock double jump right now.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I'm so bad.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Let's go.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Let's go.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Let's go.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Let's go.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
I'm so bad.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Literally, it has like infinite health.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Enemies can't touch me.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
What defeats me? A gap in the ground.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Okay, I see how it is.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Ah!

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Bleeding heart was coming right at me.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
What?

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Oh no, not me! Oh, I don't like meages.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Big jump! Great, checkpoint.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Is there going to be like an enemy behind this?

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
I feel like this is too...

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
No, there isn't. Okay, I'm surprised.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Wow!

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Oh, I missed.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Bonus time!

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Oh, that frog just...

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
did it's self in.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
I don't know if you saw that.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
He's that I've had enough.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Only Stronik is doing well.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Actually Crash and Conquer are both

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Ginger.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
What do you have for that?

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Thank you anonymous for the tip.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I appreciate it.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Yeah, Conquer is Bad Friday.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I have no idea why my dad let me play that game.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
I know that I think about it because it's absolutely outrageous.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Oh wait, I can't really fucking know.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Oh my god, I like the jumpy ones.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Conquer is Bad Friday was far too inappropriate.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Oh, it's a timer!

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
It's a timer!

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
It's a timer!

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
It's a timer.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
I don't like timer stuff, sorry.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Oh wait, no!

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I missed the box back there!

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Let me go down, go down!

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I missed the box!

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Let me go back!

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I missed that!

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Farm, no.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Oh, there's two of them now.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Farm!

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
To the farm!

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
You will be a slave on it.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
And you will do all the bidding.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And then the refling is going to have a day off because you're the bad guy.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Farm, no.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Eh?

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
What did that do?

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
No, it was on the bonus level!

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
I'm a stinky stinkerton!

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I asked the game to put me go back,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
but it never put me back.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
I'm eating my blueberry muffin

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
because I need to eat.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
What's in the box?

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Disappointment!

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Because I can't go back.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
I want to go back!

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I want to go back!

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Okay, let me eat my muffin.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Classic 5am

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Physicers, honestly.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
This OST is bangin'.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I didn't realise how good Crash Bandicoot was.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
For the OST, I didn't remember any of it.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Have you talked to Coco in the hub?

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I don't really search for that stuff when I'm on the hub.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I'm more of an overwatch searcher.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
That was terrible.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Interact, Ray Bumper.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Hi!

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Do you want her to join your adventure?

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I can go be Coco?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Oh, that's going to confuse me.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Sorry, Coco, you're going to have to go away.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Ah! Wait, I get to play as a girl?

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Ooh!

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
A girl gamer.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
She's just like me.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I want to be Coco because I'm a girl.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Let me finish my muffin.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
It's like a little baby blueberry muffin.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Ah!

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I cannot wait to get 3D models

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
because you will see how much I move around

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
and articulate with my hands

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
and all of that.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Boy! Thank you for the gifted member.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
And E-boss.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Thank you for becoming on the membership tier.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Membership streams start next week.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
So after buckshot roulette

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
or probably at the start of buckshot roulette stream

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I will reveal to you my humble schedule

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
for a stream that week.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Oh yeah, you successfully avoided

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
the membership again.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Can't wait for Strony to flip us off in 3.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I saw someone

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
3D model have physics

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
around their buttocks area

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and I'm like, I need that ASAP.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Sorry, I've almost finished my muffin.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Oh my god.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
These games have such charm.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Like when your character is AFK

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
they do like a little idle thing.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Like it's... oh!

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Oh, we've got a phone call. Hold on, who's this?

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I see, what's going on?

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Alright, bye.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
She hardly even spoke to him.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Right, are we on 7?

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Hang them high.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Literally, there's like so much detail.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Whoa, what's this?

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Oh my god.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Who knows that Aladdin soundtrack?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Prince Ali

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Whoa, what am I supposed to do with that?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Am I supposed to spank him when he looks away?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
That's what you get.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Thank you again, boy.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Boy for the 5 gifted members.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Big congrats to those who caught it.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Whoa, what is that?

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
What is that?

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
What the fuck is that?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
What the fuck? What is he doing?

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Does he just block the wave?

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Okay, oh my god.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I'm sorry, but that's so menacing.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
When something follows your movement pattern

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
that is so menacing.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I did not enjoy that.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Don't do that again.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Don't ever spawn in an enemy like that again game

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
because it's so like scary.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Hold on, I'm having a cola hydration check.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
What the fuck?

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
No, no, Coco, stop getting phone calls.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
God, you're one busy girl.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Oh, wait, hold on.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Wait, jump and then hit.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Yeah.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
And then...

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Whoa, oh my god.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I feel like games like this

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
used to be so creative, honestly.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Right, jump down, check point.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
What was that?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Dab.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Oh, that was so mean.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
He had the delivery to do,

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
and I just ruined his delivery.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Go away. You scare me.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
Menacing man on a carpet.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Wow.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Oh my god, there's so much.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Whoa, oh, there's a monkey again.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
That's okay.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Oh, I hurt myself.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
But when you hurt yourself,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
you'll also hurt the enemy.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Okay, I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Wow, I can't see.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Check point, I can't see now.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I am a monkey.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Oh, wait, I didn't realize I could do that.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Go away, go away, man on the carpet.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Go away.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
You scare me.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I don't really want scorpions on the fan,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
so I don't think we'll send them.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Oh, there's a bonus level down here.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Look, I see it, I see it, I see it.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Take us to the bonus level.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
You missed some boxes.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I didn't realize I could attack while I was hanging up.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Oh, I missed completely.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Oh no, I got drabated.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I'm supposed to go up here.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Wait, I'd rather go for a life.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
I was speeding up.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Oh, wait, I can't get them.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Whoa, that was lucky.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Wait, what?

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
How am I supposed to get that one down there?

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Oh, butt bouncing adventures!

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Pre-DLC.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
How am I supposed to get down there?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Was that supposed to do something?

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I don't know, chief.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I didn't get it.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
TNT, am I supposed to blow it up?

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I don't know.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Literally, we're doing butt bouncing adventures

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
for Elden Ring even now.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
So, for the Elden Ring DLC.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Wow.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Those are so good.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Oh, we're at 14 lives as well.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
That's fantastic.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
I can't wait to make 14 mistakes.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Oh!

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
He bumped me away!

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Checkpoint!

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
What am I supposed to do here?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
That?

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Ow!

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I couldn't get over it.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
See you lanky tall bastards!

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Honestly.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
How do I do the bottom one?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
How do I do the bottom ones?

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Okay.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
That makes sense.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Oh!

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
You know what?

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Give me double jump already.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Just give me double jump.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
This is getting outrageous.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Just give me double jump.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Right, you look ready.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Parish to the Fires of Gondor.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Wait, no, that's not it.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Cast it into the Fires of Gondor.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
No, that's not right.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
See you and your wee weaving baskets!

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
He almost pushed me off the map!

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Don't bump me!

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
What did that do?

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Oh!

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Wait, what did that do?

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Something just happened.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I don't know what.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Well, get me out of this level.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I got too confused.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I'm not well enough for that.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
The Fires of Gondor.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I don't know why I said that.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I'm doing too many things at once.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
This is really hard on my brain.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I didn't like that one.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
That mission was scary.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
The wee...

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Hog Raid?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
How creative!

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I'm sore!

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Oh my god, it really said no women are allowed to drive.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Wow, this game did not age well.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
That's terrible.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I shouldn't have said that.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Oh, wait.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
What?

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Okay.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Right.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Am I just to get through the level

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
without getting hurt?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I think I can do that.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Whee!

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Oopsies.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Oh no, the pole!

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
It's a polis, lads.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
It's a polis. Pause.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Right, who's got a bag on them?

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I don't want to touch them.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Right, we're doing a jump kick.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Whee!

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Oh wait, I'm fourth place.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
I'm to beat these people?

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Oh, oh no.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Oh no, this can't be.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
I didn't realize I was actually racing.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I was just having fun driving, to be honest.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
I just think this is a cool map.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Oh no.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I'm supposed to win.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Ah!

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Okay, hold on.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Oh no, I lost!

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
No, wait.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Oh no, why did I just break

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
to let that guy go third?

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Wait, I won though.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Oh no, I didn't win!

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Oh no!

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I have to actually win.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
I was just having fun driving, not going to lie.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I was like, oh, this is actually a really

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
fun wee game.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Oops.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Is there like a boost button?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Or is it literally just send it?

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Okay, I'm just going for it.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I don't know if there's a sender.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I think I maybe have to hit all the green boost.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
And it like guarantees you to go ahead

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
of, whoa!

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Crash, what are you doing?

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
The steering crash!

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Oh my god, there is like, no steering!

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Ah!

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Oh wait, I don't die if I hit them?

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Okay.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Right, I'm third place.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
I just need to hit all the green that comes up.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Uh...

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Right.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
All right, hold on.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I'm looking for the green to get me ahead.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Crash, please stop skittin',

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
skittin' a boot.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Okay, there's a green there.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Oh!

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Get in my way!

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Your ball back!

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
No!

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
No!

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Right, again, again, again, again, again.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
He was in my way!

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Right, try again. Go again, Crash.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Try again.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
He was in my way on the greenery.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
The green pads are the boost, yeah.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Right, let's freakin' try that again.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
I feel like when I played this as a child,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
if I even got this far,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I probably would be crying right now.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
You know how like kids cry in frustration

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
when they can't win?

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
I feel like...

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I'd be greeting right now.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Because I'm so bad at the game.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Would you laugh at

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
a young, strongy crying right now?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Crying are we eyes out.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Right, I'm third place.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
There should be like

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
three green speed-ups ahead.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I'm not going to break the boxes.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I'm wondering if that slows me down a bit.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Go ahead.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
So that's me second place.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Okay.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Crash, you're going to have to put... Crash!

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
No, wait, what must the...

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
It's Bioball here!

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
It's Bioball here!

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I got first place!

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Oh my god!

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
We did it!

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
We did it!

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
We are the champions.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
There's no time

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
for loses

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
because we

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
are the champions

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
of the world.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It's Tim Tame.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Forget Tim Reader.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Oh no, not the Aussies.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Anything but the Australians.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
No, save us!

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Oh.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Are you squidding me right now?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Jack, thank you for the tip. Well done, strongy.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Purple burglar alert.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I don't know, maybe not the farm.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Maybe go with the animal sanctuary rescue.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Thank you for the tip, Jack.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Oh my god, we're in Tim Tame's tomb.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Oh, look at the detail on the walls.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I'm sorry, but

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
they don't

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
make games like they used to.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Look at, wow, what is that?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
A Crocodonkey.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Right, go away.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It got my butthole!

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I didn't even get a checkpoint.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
That's how

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
not far into the game I was.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
It got my butthole.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I'm so bad.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Right, big jump.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And then up the stairs.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And then jump.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Okay, let's find that thing.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
That was just bad timing.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Whoa!

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
It's oil!

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I'm really scared. Oh my god, it's made from Overwatch.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I can't believe they based this game on made from Overwatch.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Whoa!

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Oh my god!

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
She's so cute when she skates.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I love Coco.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Boom, boom, boom.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Look at the detail on the walls.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Uh...

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Yeah, I saw that. I saw that.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I had video game knowledge to know something wasn't right there.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Brian!

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Brian, but no message.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Thank you for the tip.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Brian, but no message.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Brian!

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Don't tell America there's oil there.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
We're getting invaded.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Wait, there's TNT everywhere.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Oh, this is not going to go well for me.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Get me the heck out of here.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I'm not even just...

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Does it blow off?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Okay, it just blows up TNT in the vicinity.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Okay, that's fine.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Oh no, I'm scared.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I'm hiding.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Something just went flying.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I don't know what, but...

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Thank you for the tip, Brian.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Okay.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Yeah, I knew there was something up there,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
but I didn't want to jump on it

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
because I got scared.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Oh wait, I could have barely flopped on the other side of the map.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Oops.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I can't believe it.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I'm not an MLG gamer.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
What's this?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Oh, it's a time.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Oh my god, it's the Anka symbol.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Is that a Gen 2 reference?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Eh? I need to jump over this?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Okay, I can do that.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
See you, yo, bam.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Great.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Oh no.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Oh, I got...

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I heard the...

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
What did you hear?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Am I a vampire?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Are you squiddling here?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Ah!

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Ah.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
That's a trick.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
The Dinger, thank you for the five.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
You know what?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I actually was in trade.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I can't do it this month or maybe next month.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
However, I am so down to do...

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
like...

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
what?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I am so down to do

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
showing off game dev type.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
How the heck did I get over there?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I cannot make that jump. I know that for a fact.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I'm so down to do that

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
to give game devs that are smaller

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
a bigger chance type thing.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
And we write a little review.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
We write a little review at the end.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Oh no.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Oh no, this can't be.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Look at all the paint.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Look at the detail.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
They're implying that they're painting the murals right now.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Look!

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It's so fun and cute.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Thank you again for the five by Dinger.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
How do I do this?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Is it a timer?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I don't know.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Okay, it's a timer.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Do not be distracted from the fact that it's a timer.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
As beautiful as the game's...

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
The game's

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
background

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
storytelling is the thingy.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It is a timer, so do not be fooled.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Wait until it gets close to you, okay?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Wait until it gets close to you.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Oh!

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Right, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Child's game absolutely

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
decimating me.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Oh my god.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Growing women beaten to pulp

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
via child's game.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Once it opens, then just go straight for it.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Right.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I'll wait until that comes back.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Because, yeah.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Unless Coco can just stand on this.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Okay, yeah.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Okay, we're safe, we're safe.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
We're safe.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Wait!

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Wait, how am I supposed to get around that?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Oh wait, no!

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
There's a life back there!

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Okay, that's what I need.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Yes.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
That sounded terrible.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I said I need a lifter.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Right, we've got a checkpoint.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Right, go!

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Uh-huh.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Oh no!

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Coco!

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Coco!

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Right, no wonder there's a freaking checkpoint there.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Coco, what was that abysmal attempt?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
You know exactly what you were doing, hen.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You, Karrish.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Whoa.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Flamethrower's a bit dramatic.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
This is a child's game.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Wow!

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I'm scared!

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Oh Coco!

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I'm scared.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Oh, get me off this level.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I hate platforming like that.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Oh, get me off, get me off, get me off.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Oh, another portal we go.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Safety, safety.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Only time's strong to get smashed.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Reflens, are you not coming to the convention?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Hold on a minute.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Hold on, this is news to me.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Right, no, I played that one.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And I just did that one, didn't I?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Okay.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So we're gonna play

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Midnight Run.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Okay, Midnight Run.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Midnight Run.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
What's my tiger called?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I'm sure my tiger has a name.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Oh my God!

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
He's so cute!

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I can't handle it.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Tiger confirmed for Jin too.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Oh my God!

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You're so cute!

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Oh my God, jump, jump high.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Oh, there's a lot of enemies up here.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Oh, jump!

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Oh, check mark.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And jump.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Jump food.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Oh, I love this freaking tiger so much.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Oh my God, why am I doing so much better on later levels

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
than I am on the early level?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Oh my God!

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
You're cheatsy doodle!

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Did you see that?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Oh my God, I cheatsy doodle!

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Right, checkpoint, checkpoint.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Jump.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I saw that.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I saw what the game was trying to do.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I'm tryharding on this level.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I don't care.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I love it.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And I love me tiger.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Love me cocoa.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Love me China wall.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Simplest.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Oh my God!

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
This freaking best level ever!

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I know.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Jump, jump, sled, sled.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I love the tiger.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Jin won, you won for now.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
It's 100k.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
What, steady on, steady on.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
No, I think I'll hold him for a while.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Trying to be gaming like a pro?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I freaking love!

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Oh no, we're doing a boss fight.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Cola check.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Everyone hydrate.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
We're about to do a boss fight.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
The tiger's called Pura?

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Oh my God, Jin to confirm tiger girl called Pura.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I'm not even care.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Oh, I've just tabbed out.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
That was a terrible idea.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Sorry, I just tabbed out of the game.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I got a DM.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Okay, I have, I have good news for everyone.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I don't, I have good news for everyone.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Mercy and Aisy's meme ASMR are going up today.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I just got confirmation from the squadron.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Dingo Dale.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
A Dingo Dale.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
A Dingo Dale.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Oh my God, that's such an Aussie name.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Oh my God, they said no whammin' fights.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Yay!

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
A tiger girl called Pura.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Them crystals are mine.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Call me Pura.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Oh, it's a...

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Break out the butter.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Uh, uh, what?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
What is this?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Um...

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Hmm?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I don't...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I don't understand how he auto-locked me.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Oh, he did it again!

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Hold on, sorry, sorry.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I'm looking, I'm looking where his gun is pointing.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Sorry, give me, give me a second.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
It takes me a second to figure things out for myself.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Hold on, hold on.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
My brain isn't hot wires like the way it's hot wired for you.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Right, he's aiming there.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Ah!

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
He keeps aiming!

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Now what?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Oh, he keeps going.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Oh!

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Please don't do that.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Oh!

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Please don't do that!

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I'm trying to hurt him.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Okay.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Oh.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Okay, I just need to do that three times.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Okay, okay.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I just needed a second to digest what the game is asking me to do.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
That's all.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I just needed a tricky second.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Right, if he just keeps all locking,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I could probably just keep going like this.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Oh, no.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Okay.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Twat him?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Okay, okay.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Okay, okay, okay.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Last one, boys.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I just need to look on the ground.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
No.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Oh no, does he do a variation attack?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Oh.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Okay, nice and easy.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
We did it, we did it, we did it.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Unless we need to do anything special, I think that's good.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Oh my God, he let you win.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
With a Higgy or then?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Yeah, get him, Penguin!

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Beat his ass, Penguin.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
We'll do it together.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
No one will do it.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Yeah, beat him up, beat him up.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
We love penguins in here.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Gen 2 penguin confirmed.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Double jump.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Yes, a jump twice as high.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Okay, I can probably replay those other missions if I so desired.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
No.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Oh my God, look at that vertical leap.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Look at that vertical leap.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Get me in the NBAs right now, NBAs.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
NBA?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
NBA.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Get me in the NBAs right now.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Coco, show us that double jump.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Wow, look at that.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
She's a cheerleader.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Oh my God, she's such a cheerleader.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Right, we're going to change the turn.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Let's go.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Right, what are we eating first?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Baggies from Dim Sum's.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
We're doing the Dano Mate.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Oh my God, that's such a good name for a TNT dinosaur.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Oh my God, Gen 2 confirmed.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Sorry, I'm just stealing all my Gen 2 ideas from Crash Bandicoot.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I don't mind if I do.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
A pair of Pate Marsupials.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I am Dr. Nefarious Trope.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Master of Time and the creator of the very time twister machine you see before you.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Uka Uka and Dr. Cortex have sent me to end this little shroud.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
So you won't be leaving my area with the crystals?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I swear it.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Wow, this game is so fun.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Thank you for watching.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
No, no, no.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Is that what I think it is?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Is this going to be a chase sequence?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I take it all back.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Is this a chase sequence?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Oh my God, I can like clear those with ease.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
What the heck is that?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Honestly, honestly.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Oh, that's lava.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
That's not a path.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Oh my goodness.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000
My brain literally registered that last second.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Oh my God, this looks like a chase sequence map.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
See it ain't so.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I will not go turn the lights off.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Carry me home.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Oh my God, that fish is so freaky.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
It's supposed to look like crash, isn't it?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I'm not just making that up.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Oh, go away.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Oh, go away.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
You're so creepy.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Oh, I'm scared.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I don't like it.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Wait, why are you not possible?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
That's the second one that's not possible.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I wonder why that's not possible.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Wow, the grass slowed me down.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
No.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Oh, I stood on its head.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Oh, it's like Mario.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
If you stand on its head, it's gone.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
It's dead if you stand on it.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Wait, what does the egg do?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Hello.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
We kissed the egg and let it germinate.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Am I supposed to break it?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I really don't want to break it.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I feel like I was really mean.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I don't want to break the egg.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I'm sorry.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
There's something germinating inside it.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
We want it to wish it success.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Great success in your life.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Break the egg.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I don't want it.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
There's something living inside it.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
If you...

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Although saying that, you can actually grow chickens

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
without their shell or being cracked open.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I don't actually recommend you doing it, but...

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
What?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Did you see that?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
How big that thing was?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Go away.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
No egg breakie.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:02.000
We are nice to nature.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Okay, okay, okay.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Oh, the music is so good.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I love children's games.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I love them being relatively easy.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
I'm smart at that segment.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I knew exactly what you were going to ask me.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Bonus mission.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
You got a break here.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Break egg.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Help it hatch.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Oh, I'm to help it hatch?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Oh, that's different then.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Okay, I'll break the eggs when I see them.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Wow.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Butt smash.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Oh, I missed that one back there.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
That's okay.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Butt smash.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Wow.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Oh, that's like so many wumper fruit.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And a life, which I definitely mean how much I'm...

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Oh, I can't reach it.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I couldn't reach it anyway.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Oh, well.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Oh, well.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Wee.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Let's go.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
We're strong and we weave.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You don't get excited.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
No, I saw it.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I saw it.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Did you see it too?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I saw the Terran and Zoran ring.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I have double jump.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Okay.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Okay.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Trust in the double jump.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Okay.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Wow, you're going so fast.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I have double jump and I still feel that jump.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Wow.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Oh, cool, cool.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
This camera angle isn't helping, darling.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Yes, a bear camera angle, please.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Oh, please give us a bear camera angle.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Oh, get me out of here.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Oh, my God.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
How are you supposed to know what's coming up?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
How are you supposed to know?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
No more dino missions, please.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
My heart can't take it.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I'm getting so stressed out.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Deep trouble.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Okay, my time.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
We still call that a skill issue.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Okay.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Okay, you're done.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Back to the...

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
You need reaction time.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I don't have reaction time, though.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
What?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Can I go up?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
No, sorry.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
The game almost looked like I could go up.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Okay, let's hope I don't mess this up.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Too much.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I'm just going to spam.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Oh, my God.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Yes, spamming.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Why did you not get hit?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Well, I'll leave you alive.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
But tell your family.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I almost got electric shock.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Oh, my God.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Actually, I'm so sorry if you get sick of that meme.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
It's probably the funniest thing I enjoy right now.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
It's just full going, oh, my God.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
This character confirmed.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I don't know.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I just find it really funny.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Okay, I can beat up sharks underwater.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Oh, my God.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I'm stuck in a vortex.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Oh, my God.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Okay, it's fine.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
We made it.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
We made it.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Wow.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I like the tissues are just hanging out in this one winter thing.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Oh, God, that was two for one.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Oh, my God.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Crash Bandicoot really said inflation.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Inflation confirmed for gender.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I'm so sorry.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Oh, I did it twice.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Oh, my God.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I'm so sorry.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Please excuse me by all means.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Right.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Let's not do that again.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Spin.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Right.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
There.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Jeez.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Why was that so hard?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Crystal does, but does it like a locker bonus thing for me later?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I'm just using my damage to get out.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Whoa.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I didn't even see that.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Literally spinning damage helps you move so much faster.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Inflation.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Wow.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I don't have a mask right now, so this is extra scary.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Right.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I didn't know you died in the vortex.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Oh, no.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
How far back am I?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I lost me boat a wee bit ago.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I'm just spamming.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Am I going crazy?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
No.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Oh, my God.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
We're going to the rapture bio shot confirmed.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Oh, wait.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I can just destroy the natural boxes when I'm like this.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
That's fine.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Oh, no.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Why am I so bad at timing?

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
I made it.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I made it.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I made it.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Oh, right.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Okay.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
I literally perished right before the end of that level.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
You need the purple crystals to unlock the boss.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Okay.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Bioshock.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I know.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Literally.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I'm sorry.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
It's my favorite joke right now because I have had messages like that that have been

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
like, you said this in one stream.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Does that mean?

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Is this the?

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Oh, my God.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Wait.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Can the girl drive?

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Girl can't drive.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Wow.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Wow.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
You mean a big sister?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Oh, we don't have a big sister, do we?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000
We do have a mama.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Maybe we should do like a cousin third removed for Gentoo.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Oh, no.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
I'm terrible at the different people.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Oh, no.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Okay.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Let's get to it.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Everybody.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Let's get to it.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
To it.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Let's get them 40s popping.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Right.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Wait.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
They can use the ramps.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I thought they can use the ramps.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I thought only I could.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
That's how I was like predicting where they were going to go.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Go away.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
No.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Get out my way.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
This is my road.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Oh, my God.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Sorry.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It's like, wait.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I don't even know where the controls are.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I'm sliding if I do a.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I'm definitely lost this one.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
That's all I'm going to say.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
We are going to play.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
We are replaying this for as long.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I don't know what the controls are.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Can someone tell me what the controls are?

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Because I'm holding like, oh, I'm a, but I'm like, well, no.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I'm holding right trigger, but it keeps making me slide everywhere.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And that just instantly stopped my speed.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
What is going on?

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I'm confusion.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I'm, I'm a philosopher because I'm Confucius.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
What the heck?

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Bro.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Stop sliding.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Crash.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Crash.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
What is going on?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Yeah.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I've definitely haven't won this one.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Get out of my way.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I'll rearrange you and make it look like an accident.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Wait.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I don't know what.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Sorry.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I'm going to have to look up the controls for this game mode because I'm definitely doing

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
something wrong.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Like crash speeds up and then he slows down.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Wait.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I'm not.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I don't have any turning power when he does that.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Crash.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Crash.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Crash.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Our insurance bill is going to be.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Oh, wait.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Whoa.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
They really said Mario Kart out here.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Yeah.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
They said if you fall off the map, it's fine.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Whoa.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Controls just accelerate.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I just accelerated and got sixth place.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
So something tells me I'm doing something wrong.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Strongly confirmed for Gen 2.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I need first to progress to the next mission.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Guys, I have a terrible feeling we're going to be here.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
She's got ran over.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Did you see that?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Insurance fraud simulator on a flu.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
She's got ran over.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Oh my God.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Child's game.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
It's okay.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
You're sixth place, but we still love you.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Literally green.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Is it?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Is there?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Accelerate just before a green light to boost.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
One, two, boost.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
That.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Okay.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Hold on a minute.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
We're getting strats.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I managed to read the help screen.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Okay.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Okay.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Let him get up.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Let him get up.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Get out my way.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Right.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Everyone's doing that, but I actually don't know if you're slower on ramps or not.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Right.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Okay.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Hold up.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Hold up.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Hold up.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Hold up.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
We're getting there.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
We're getting there.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
If you cross the road right now, you're such a vampire.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
You're actually such a freaking idiot.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
He purposely, can I reset?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Because there's no way I'm going to win.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Resume.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Oh, you can't reset.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
He's such a liar.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Literally swerving into me.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I'm faster.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I really don't feel it.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Why are all these cops on the road?

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I know.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Literally.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Meet her springs out here with the cop hiding behind the billboard to catch Lightning McQueen.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
What's that?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I know the lore of freaking cars.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Yeah.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
What are you going to do about it?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Wait.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Oh my God.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Car girl confirmed for Gen 2, but you get to stick it in her exhaust pipe.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Oh my God.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Did you guys see that thing on YouTube where the guy's in love with his car?

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.000
It was like my weird obsession and he makes love to his car and it's red.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I just remember the car being red and me being like, huh?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Huh?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Okay.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
We're actually somehow doing better even though I've played considerably worse.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yeah.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Like he keeps going off the map.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I don't know why.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
The A.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Ah!

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Okay.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Well, I'm still, excuse me, insurance fraud people on the phone right now.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Oh my God.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Why did they make this so hard?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I just got ran over again.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Right.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Hold on.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Let me look up the controls because I don't think anyone...

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
It said two things to me when I played the game mode for the first time.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Hold on.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Crash.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Bandicoot warped.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
What is this?

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Motorcycle controls.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Xbox.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I'll put Xbox because I'm using Xbox controller.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Hold down the X button to accelerate and square to break.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I said Xbox controls.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
We don't have a square.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
So it's literally breaking go.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000
It's literally just breaking go and that's it.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
What is accelerate?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Is A accelerate?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I guess A is accelerate.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Right.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
And then I just need to focus on not...

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Oh my!

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Oh!

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And we don't even have an option to reset.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I don't know if I'd be faster to reset and then go again.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Bra.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Literally.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Get out my way, honestly.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Can the game tell that I'm a struggling child and then the AI will lower?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
You know how some of those games have like reflective AI and they're like,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
oh my God, you're struggling.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
We're just going to lower the game difficulty for you.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Can I have that please?

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I'm literally struggling so hard.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Right.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Stop drifting crash.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
It's causing a lot of issues.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
It's causing a lot of issues.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Can you stop?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Oh!

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Right.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Right.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Right.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Right.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Right.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I get it.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I get it.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Crash!

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Crash.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Oh!

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Well, I'm actually going to have a word with you once the stream is over.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Oh my God.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Can I really not progress?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Wait, I'm going to back out and see if I can just skip to the next level

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000
because oh my God.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And there's so many police on the road and they're not even doing their job.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
You're not even a civil servant.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.000
You're not even serving the public at all just hanging about on Route 66 for any reason.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Honestly.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Nay wonder, like folk call themselves a sovereign citizen.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
You ain't doing shit.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
No again, please.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Oh my God.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Please.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Okay.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I'm going to back out and I'm going to see if we can progress to the next thing

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
because this is impossible.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Nay wonder, Coco.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Right.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
No.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Don't restart level.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Give me a break.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Let me come back to it.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Let me come back to it because I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I don't know how I'm supposed to do it.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Right.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.000
We're not doing road crash more like right.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Hang time.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
So what did I just do?

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
12.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
No.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
What?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Okay.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
We're doing 15.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Oh wow.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
It does let you skip ahead.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Thank God.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
You need that crystal.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
No.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Eh?

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Go away.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Wait.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Oh.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Okay.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:20.000
You can't even do anything against these guys at all.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
How did I...

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I didn't want to break it but hey ho.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Oh.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
You don't get anything out of them?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Right.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I can definitely do this.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Whee.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
What?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Who put all this poison to turn the fricking frogs game?

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
There's...

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Wait.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
How am I supposed to get past?

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Oh my gosh.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
That was like so close.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I'm sorry.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I don't know what the hitbox is like in this game.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000
But I'm feeling it Mr. Krabs.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Oh okay.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I was just going to belly flop.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Well that wasn't worth it.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Swing.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Swing.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And then get past.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Okay.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
We're doing it.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
We're doing it.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
It's fine.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
It's fine.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
So if I do this...

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
No that's not...

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I don't really want to set it all.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Wah.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Oh shit.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I thought I had enough distance to do that.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Okay.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I won't do that again.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I'll leave the TNT as is.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I don't need anything from the TNT.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Two.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
One.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Jump.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Swing.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Wah.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
It almost perished.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Right.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
We're leaving TNT alone because I don't know how to deal with it.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I ain't smart enough for this.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Swing.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Bouncy bouncy down.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Right.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I don't need that.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I don't really know what to do with it either but I don't need it.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Go to the farm.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Right now.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
No.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
There's a mage.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Come on away.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Bouncy bouncy down.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Farm!

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Farm!

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.000
We need lots of floats so they can help with

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
the pests in the garden.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Okay.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
We can do special missions.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
How to stay ininal for mages.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:50.680

Oh, we can do the boss.

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.720
Oh my God.

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:35.560
Right.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.600
Holy crap.

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.600
I am so sorry if anyone's name is Crash.

You're adrenaline must be pumping right now.

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.040
Holy crap.

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:45.880
First try.

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.320
Yes, that was my first attempt on that map.

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.040
Thank you for admitting how amazing.

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:53.880
Wait, did I forget to do a mission?

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.560
Did I forget to do a mission?

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.520
Oh, I forgot to do a mission completely.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.640
OK, sorry, we need to do hang time.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.760
I completely forgot to just do an entire mission.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.360
My apologies.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:19.080
Well, you've crashed a few parties before,

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:22.600
but I never expected you to make it this far.

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:25.000
If you don't turn back.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.920
Yeah, I've lived the thousand years

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.440
as the flag of you, and the entire universe.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.000
OK.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:38.920
OK, I can do this.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:39.560
I can do it.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.000
And these kind of maps are.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.960
Molotov cocktails.

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:48.040
I'm sorry, but there's something

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.560
about the Geneva Convention with that.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:51.200
What's going on here?

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.560
Oh my God.

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:55.920
A magic carpet ride.

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:56.760
Oh.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.080
Did I just get put in a jar?

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.480
Oh, wait, I forgot these guys.

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.120
So Molotovs already.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:11.800
And a magic carpet ride.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:27.000
Oh, I can hardly see that as it comes over.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.640
All right, give me a checkpoint because it's not looking good.

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:33.320
OK, wow.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:35.520
Isn't this not?

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.080
No, I'm going to put back here.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.400
This is so far away.

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.320
I better get a checkpoint right now.

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.680
Give me a checkpoint right now.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.920
And me figure when?

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.640
Go away.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:57.480
And me a figurine.

01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:01.160
You'll have to like and subscribe a bit more for a figurine.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.600
The thing when right.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.200
OK, sorry, I'm getting distracted.

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.680
And if you guys are like serious,

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.600
but like, oh, when can we get this particular merch?

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.080
That particular merch.

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:16.160
The sad thing is I have to message these companies

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.360
and then I basically have to go, here's the statistics.

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.120
Here's.

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.600
Oh, I almost perished there.

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.600
And it's like I can't go to a company to produce like merchandise.

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.240
It's like a lot of money.

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:33.080
And and sorry, let me try hard.

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.400
So OK, that's fine.

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:40.920
We got the checkpoint.

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:45.360
And and I basically I can't ask for like this merchandise

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.440
that costs like thousands to be produced.

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:50.320
If it's like, yeah, we've got 4,000 subscribers,

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.000
like it's just not happening.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.320
And so, you know, if you ever want to support your girls,

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:59.120
just make some clips of them go viral or something.

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.800
I don't know.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.400
OK, holy crap.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.800
Wow, this is a risky map.

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.480
I'm not going to lie.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.200
Oh, bonus map.

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.200
Bonus time.

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.280
They need a minimum guaranteed return on investment.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.560
Yes, like Uber market and we're absolutely fantastic

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:22.760
because to get to get.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:27.200
I completely forgot I can double jump half the time.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.560
Wait, I don't know.

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:36.040
Oh, there we go.

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:39.000
And I'm not.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.640
I don't want to accidentally fall off the map, to be honest.

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:43.040
I'm quite happy just to move on.

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:46.240
And yeah, like you need to go to the company

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.600
and be like, this is what we do.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.280
And this is why we're a good fit for you here

01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:55.640
as a statistic to back up, like, you know, such and.

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.720
And oh, right.

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:00.320
Give me that.

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.040
You go away.

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.520
I didn't realize there's flamethrowers here.

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.600
What's that death?

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.080
Do I want to go on that one?

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.240
I did just hit a checkpoint.

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.040
Oh, no.

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.040
Oh, no, I just said luck to an achievement for that.

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.080
OK, get viral, get viral, get viral.

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:23.160
Yes.

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:24.720
And like, as I said, Uber market

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:28.200
were fantastic because they gave three designs.

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:31.120
Like, they made three designs for the girls.

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:33.400
And it was like, the girls aren't even out.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.000
We had absolutely no idea what the estimations

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.080
were looking like or the success or whatever.

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.720
And we were much.

01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:45.480
No wonder they call it the death route.

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.880
Right, I'm not doing that again.

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:50.320
I don't think it's imperative to the clock.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.120
Oh, yeah, no, I'm not fussing for the death route.

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:54.760
Wee.

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:56.200
Why has it got random TNT?

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.840
You got an A. But, yeah, they were like, yeah,

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:05.640
you can have three designs, which was fantastic.

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:11.800
And if all, oh, wait, I don't want to touch that

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:14.640
because it's TNT.

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:16.400
The guys just throwing swords over there.

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:24.040
Oh, checkpoint.

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:24.920
All right, hold on.

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:25.600
Jump.

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.120
Belly float.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.960
Oh, wait, that's TNT there.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.320
So it doesn't blow.

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:35.840
Oh, go away.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:36.840
You're so creepy.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.880
Oh, yeah.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:45.240
Is this?

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:47.160
Are you going to?

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:50.280
Sugar, that hurt me.

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.480
That's OK.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.000
Um.

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.880
Oh, I don't like the look of that.

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:04.360
Oh, I'm not even in range of it.

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:06.960
Oh, my God, his mouth like being wide open.

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:08.040
While he's climbing.

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.440
Oh, thank God, get me off this map.

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.200
You have to complete them to get the best ending.

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:18.040
Isn't there not only one ending where you win this crash

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:20.800
pancake game was like that.

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:28.560
But I've all met up with this enemy doctor entropy.

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:35.360
Isn't entropy when you're like skinny?

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:37.600
I'm not thinking of something.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:42.760
Ah, you little vermin are way too stupid to understand

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.000
what you're getting yourself into.

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.160
This time, you've done it.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:52.240
Wahaa.

01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:54.280
Entrophy.

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:57.280
There's usually a special 100% completion ending.

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.960
Uh, jump.

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:03.760
What does that mean?

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.200
What does that mean?

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:06.920
What does it mean?

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.040
I don't know.

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:08.520
Woo.

01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:14.680
Oh.

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.680
Take that, you scallywag.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.680
Ah, OK, OK, OK, OK.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:22.680
Whoa.

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:26.680
Oh, my God, the music.

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:33.680
Oh.

01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:40.680
I actually really like that the boss fights aren't that hard.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.680
Like, I said it.

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:42.680
I'm sorry, I said it.

01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:44.680
Sorry if this is going to age terribly,

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.680
and I'm going to struggle with the next boss fight.

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.680
But I think this is lovely.

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:51.680
Like, this is a lovely experience.

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.680
I spoke far too soon.

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:03.680
I apologize for my ignorance.

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:04.680
I do.

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:05.680
I spoke far too soon.

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:06.680
I admit it.

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:08.680
I confess to my sins.

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:10.680
All right, let's try that again.

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:14.680
OK, let's try that again.

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:17.680
I never made it this far into the game as a child.

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.680
I don't think I did either, because I am,

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.680
I don't recall anything past Coco.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.680
I just think that only remember Coco.

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:33.680
OK.

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:35.680
OK.

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.680
OK, OK.

01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.680
Right, this time, don't let the missile go to my head.

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:46.680
So that'd be great.

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:52.680
OK.

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:55.680
Wow, I almost jumped into that.

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:01.680
Honestly, him laughing is so mean.

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.680
Like, if I was an evil person.

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:10.680
Take this!

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:22.680
To spin longer and faster,

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:25.680
or to glide while in the air, press X repeatedly.

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:30.680
Wow, I love that move.

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:34.680
First try, yeah, yeah, first try.

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:35.680
First try.

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:36.680
First try.

01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:37.680
Shhh.

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:00.680
Is he trying to...

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:03.680
Is he trying to guilt-trap us into losing?

01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:06.680
Who knows what it'll do?

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:07.680
Oh, no.

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.680
Right, let's go back to being a lady,

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:11.680
because we did the dread one, isn't she?

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.680
OK, we're going to Egypt to Arabia.

01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:20.680
The Sphinxinator.

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.680
I want to explore your Sphinxinator.

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.680
Oh my God, is this just going to the left side of the map now?

01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:34.680
From that previous map?

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.680
No, it's not.

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:36.680
It's just me making stuff up.

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.680
I'm sorry.

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.680
Second gen Sphinxinator.

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:44.680
Confirmed, honestly.

01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:45.680
I'm sorry, it's not...

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:46.680
Wow!

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:48.680
A sarcophagus!

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:51.680
Ah!

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.680
A mummy!

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:54.680
And not the good kind like Azura.

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:57.680
Wow.

01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.680
Wow.

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.680
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:03.680
Who?

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.680
OK, that was terrible, Taibin.

01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:10.680
Can we get like a crossbow, maybe?

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:13.680
OK, let's try that again.

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.680
I don't know when I was supposed to jump for him.

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.680
I ain't gonna lie.

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.680
Maybe I was supposed to double jump over the flames, right?

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:21.680
You?

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:22.680
And then a mummy?

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.680
OK, that's fine.

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.680
Return the slime.

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.680
Watching you play this makes me want to get...

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:33.680
Spiral.

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:37.680
I've never played Spiral, but people were recommending it.

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.680
And I was like, I might give it a shot.

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.680
Give me checkpoint, please.

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.680
But let the doors close first,

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.680
because I was 100% gonna fall for that.

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:53.680
Hold on, I want the spikes to go up.

01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:55.680
OK.

01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:00.680
All right, I'm safe to go on it for this section, which is fine.

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.680
That sarcophagus is making some...

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.680
You're scaring me!

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:14.680
I like how it pings off onto some of the items to break them for you.

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.680
Oh god, I'm so bad at this one.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:19.680
Double jump!

01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:27.680
OK, we need to wait.

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:30.680
Spiral is also fun.

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:33.680
Yeah, Spiral and Crash Bandicoot can I get...

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:35.680
Are they by like the same developers,

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.680
or was it just they happened to come out

01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:42.680
kind of close to the same time?

01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:45.680
What did I do wrong here again?

01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:48.680
I had nothing to protect me.

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.680
I'm wondering if I have more time if I do that.

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:54.680
Oh, wow, I do.

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:55.680
Right.

01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.680
And let me guess, that doesn't explode the T.

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:00.680
Oh, no, it does.

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.680
I was gonna be like,

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.680
oh, let me guess, it doesn't do anything.

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:11.680
Again?

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:13.680
Oh, no.

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:17.680
Oh, we're struggling with this one.

01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:22.680
Goodness gravy.

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.680
Am I making this look easy?

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:27.680
No, sorry, am I making this look hard?

01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:32.680
Right, and then wait for it to come back,

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.680
and then jump on it,

01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.680
and then defeat the mummy twice.

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:40.680
Or the sarcophagi, jeez.

01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:46.680
Let's try this again.

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:48.680
Right, and then I can just double jump here

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:50.680
because I'm out of range.

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:53.680
And then he's gonna drop that, which explodes that one first.

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.680
Just fine with me.

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:01.680
Right, don't send it.

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.680
Don't send it, Reflings.

01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:06.680
If you ever replay this game, don't send it at that section

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.680
because that's what I thought I had to do there,

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:10.680
and it did not pay off.

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:13.680
I need to wait until he spawns the second block.

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:14.680
We'll get there.

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:16.680
It just takes me a few moments.

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:18.680
Can't believe it, they made me flat.

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:21.680
Lollipop model confirmed for Strony.

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.680
Right, again, just jump over this, which is fine.

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:28.680
Oh, there's not even TNT this time.

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:30.680
The game said, yeah, you're struggling.

01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:32.680
Right, send it, send it, send it, send it.

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:34.680
I knew it would work if I sent it.

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:36.680
Oh, I've got a checkpoint, goodness.

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.680
That'll be very welcomed, I assure you.

01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:44.680
There's really enemies behind this.

01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:46.680
Yeah, there's freaking TNT.

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:50.680
Oh.

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.680
Take your time.

01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:57.680
Take your time.

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.680
Take your time.

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:03.680
That will be a mummy.

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:06.680
Okay, we're good, we're good, we're doing it, we're doing it.

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:10.680
We are doing it, oh.

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:14.680
Why would they randomly have a natural, they are.

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:15.680
They are.

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:17.680
Oh.

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:20.680
Oh, send it, send it, send it, send it.

01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:24.680
I like how he just looks at me, as if I'm not about to coblame him.

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.680
Uh, this seems suspiciously easy.

01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:38.680
Rather, this is, this is, this is suspiciously.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:41.680
Ooh, wait, hold on.

01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:44.680
Two crystals, let's go on the bonus map.

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:49.680
Don't send it, no idea.

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:54.680
I'm literally giving you the strikes alive, because I'm struggling.

01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:56.680
Okay, there's lots of TNT.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.680
I'll just let it pop and then run away again.

01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:06.680
Whoa, oh, there's too many.

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:10.680
Oh, dear.

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:17.680
There's lots of fricking.

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:26.680
Oh well, that's the best I can do.

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:28.680
The best I can do is what I got.

01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:32.680
Cocodes, don't look at the explosion, because she's so cool.

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.680
I start off a guy.

01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:42.680
Oh, that was a bit rude of me, but I did the job.

01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.680
Oh, there's like monkeys in these pots.

01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:50.680
Sling your shit elsewhere.

01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:04.680
Oh my god, he's quaking, his little ankles are gone, he's quaking in his boots.

01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:09.680
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:12.680
Oh god, another life, thank you.

01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:17.680
Okay, ugh, perish, perish.

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:21.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.680
Start quaking more, boom.

01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:30.680
I don't know what that does, I think you're supposed to like go back when you do that, but I don't go back.

01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:35.680
There's a message in the discord, I need to be worried.

01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.680
Okay.

01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:47.680
17.

01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:51.680
Bye bye blimp, I'm in the sky.

01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:53.680
Oh my god, we're playing Crimson Skies.

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:56.680
Good game, good game, bye bye blimp.

01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:59.680
If you ever played Crimson Skies in an old old game.

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:03.680
Shoot down the blimps, I have 100% health, okay.

01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:05.680
Oh, how do I shoot?

01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:07.680
Okay, machine gun.

01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:09.680
A to do a barrel roll.

01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:14.680
Wait, I'm already down 10% health?

01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:17.680
The heck, I only just got started.

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:20.680
Oh, man.

01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:24.680
I'm going, wait that didn't break it.

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:30.680
I'm barrel rolling, oh that gives me health.

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:36.680
Oh my god, I like this game mode, this is so creative, I like it.

01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:39.680
Wow, we're getting absolutely obliterated, not gonna lie.

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:44.680
We're about to get survivor's bias going on here.

01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:50.680
Okay, wow, I like that, that was nice and simple.

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:52.680
More missions like this please.

01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:55.680
Wait, not all of us have a high IQ.

01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:58.680
You're supposed to destroy every box,

01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:01.680
the green boxes at the end get rid of the natures.

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.680
Oh my god, that was such a quick and easy one, I like that.

01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:07.680
Give me more of that, give me more of that.

01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:10.680
Give me more, give me more, tell no tales.

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.680
Oh, dead men tell no tales.

01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:17.680
Oh, someone said do a watch along of...

01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:34.680
Well, I made a few more vacations to my mechanics since our last encounter.

01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:38.680
So back on, or be deleted.

01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:41.680
Or be deleted.

01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:52.680
Oh my god, yeah.

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:55.680
Okay, we did it, we did the ramp.

01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.680
I was like, oh, I missed the timing on the ramp.

01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:59.680
We still did it.

01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.680
Right, we're safe, we're safe.

01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:09.680
Man, this freaking game is just like so unapologetically good.

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:13.680
Yeah, suck at the racing ones, but that's fine.

01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:15.680
Sorry, Mr. Seagull, you...

01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.680
I got picked to death?

01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:21.680
Oh my gosh.

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:28.680
Anyway, as I was saying before I got picked to death by a freaking seagull,

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:32.680
this game is like so unapologetically good,

01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:38.680
like it's such a chaotic, fun experience, it's so good.

01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:41.680
I didn't know the seagulls could hurt me like that.

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:46.680
I mean, is he even there? He's not even here this time.

01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:50.680
So he didn't really care that much about the boxes, did he?

01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:54.680
That was just like the music.

01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:56.680
It's so... whoa.

01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:59.680
That one, that's rude, don't do that again.

01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:01.680
You upset me.

01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:06.680
That is just like such a freaking good game experience, honestly.

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:09.680
Am I gonna land on that bomb? No.

01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:13.680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:19.680
I probably went like the longest way.

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:22.680
I don't know if I had to do that, but that was like the longest way.

01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:24.680
You're a cuttlefish after all.

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:31.680
I'll... I'll cuttle your fish in a minute if you don't...

01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:32.680
I don't know.

01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:34.680
Please leave me alone, Mr. Shark.

01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:37.680
I think I'll just do this checkpoint.

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:40.680
Yeah, let's do the checkpoint because I don't trust this.

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:44.680
This is... they're starting to really fill it out with enemies, though.

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:47.680
It was like bear the first time you played this map.

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:51.680
The bombs are moving, there's like enemies everywhere.

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:55.680
I mean, I know games are supposed to...

01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:59.680
Please leave me alone, Mr. Seagull.

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:03.680
Nope, nope, that bomb is teasing.

02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:07.680
That bomb is teasing and teasing me.

02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:09.680
Right, let's get out of here.

02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:12.680
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:16.680
But this is like a perfect remaster.

02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:17.680
Oh, there it is.

02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:20.680
That's what we need.

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:21.680
Oh, I don't want to do...

02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:22.680
I don't have a checkpoint!

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:23.680
I don't have a checkpoint!

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:24.680
Give me checkpoint!

02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:27.680
Give me give me checkpoint, give me checkpoint, give me yeah.

02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:36.680
Oh my God, I just like cheese that corner there.

02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:38.680
Okay, we're getting there.

02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:40.680
We're like... we're doing it.

02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.680
Can I do it first time, though?

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.680
Oh, I'm getting nervous.

02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:50.680
Oh, I don't know why I did that, but we'll do it.

02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:52.680
Oh my God.

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:54.680
So good.

02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:01.680
I'm so surprised how much I'm enjoying this.

02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:04.680
But then at the same time, I'll always enjoy kids' games.

02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:07.680
Like literally, Viva Faniata could like blast about for ages.

02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.680
Okay, we just did that one.

02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:13.680
We're doing 19, which is future frenzy.

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:16.680
Ooh, we're going to the city of Caloon.

02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:19.680
Although they wrecked it.

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.680
Wow, there's laser beam timing.

02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:25.680
I miss Viva Faniata.

02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:29.680
Bro, everyone is waiting for Viva Faniata 3 to be announced.

02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:34.680
Unfortunately, I didn't like Viva Faniata about trouble and paradise as much.

02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.680
Which is a shame.

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:37.680
Oh my God, this is so cool.

02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:39.680
I like all of this.

02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:41.680
I'm loving it.

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:42.680
Every day.

02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:43.680
I'm loving it.

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:44.680
I'm loving it.

02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:45.680
Can I destroy that?

02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:47.680
Okay, I can destroy it when it's like that.

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:48.680
Yeah.

02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:53.680
There's like so much...

02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:56.680
Wumper fruit.

02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:01.680
Oh my God, that nature just jumped and it scared me.

02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:05.680
Right, I can butt bounce this.

02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:10.680
Wait, we're already done?

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:11.680
No, this can't be right.

02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:13.680
It's going to take me to a new section because there's no way.

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:16.680
Yeah, I was going to say there's no way this thing is done.

02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:18.680
Viva Faniata beats.

02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:25.680
Yes, in July I am going to start hammering out gamer score.

02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:29.680
Why is there a reflective stream?

02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:30.680
Why?

02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:34.680
She slides so well.

02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:38.680
I don't like you.

02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:40.680
I'll jump on your head though.

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:46.680
I'll take you.

02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:48.680
Double jump.

02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:49.680
Okay, double jump.

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:50.680
Double jump.

02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.680
We're learning.

02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.680
Woo!

02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:00.680
Okay, just jump over it again.

02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:01.680
Okay, we're learning.

02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:02.680
We're learning.

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.680
We're observing.

02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.680
We're using our brain mass against her wills.

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:09.680
Hold on, I can double jump over this.

02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:13.680
Oh, okay.

02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:16.680
And then we'll butt bounce that.

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:17.680
No, we won't.

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:18.680
We'll double jump over this.

02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:19.680
Oh, I almost messed it up.

02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:23.680
Oh my God, the first checkpoint was so long into this.

02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:27.680
On the flyer and sorcerer guys, I hate them too.

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.680
People are waiting for reviews to be announced.

02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:33.680
And I agree.

02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:39.680
I would want some sort of remaster or get the same dev team in because they're so precious.

02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:41.680
Go away.

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.680
Oh, sugar.

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:44.680
Let's try that again.

02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:45.680
Go away.

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:47.680
Wow!

02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:48.680
What?

02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:52.680
Yeah, that's exactly what I thought was going to happen.

02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:54.680
And I was forced to do that.

02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:55.680
Think again.

02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:57.680
That guy's red.

02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.680
Go green.

02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:04.680
Go away.

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:08.680
Oh!

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:12.680
Oh, I just missed it.

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:15.680
Oh, I'm to fly.

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:17.680
Oh!

02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:18.680
All right.

02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:19.680
Oh, sorry.

02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:20.680
I thought that was going to explode.

02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:21.680
Right.

02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:22.680
We'll do the bonus level.

02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:24.680
I thought that was going to explode the moment I came near it.

02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:25.680
Okay.

02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:26.680
We're safe.

02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:27.680
Oh, no.

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:31.680
The game's telling me to like double triple quadruple jumps and stuff.

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:32.680
Wait.

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:34.680
Well, double jump and then.

02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:35.680
Okay.

02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:36.680
We're fine.

02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:37.680
We're fine.

02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:38.680
Kind of.

02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:44.680
Okay.

02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:46.680
And we got an extra life.

02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:47.680
Double jump.

02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:50.680
Right.

02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:53.680
We're not doing bonus levels anymore if there's a chance that I can perish in them.

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:56.680
I will not stand for such slander.

02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:58.680
Thank you, Virginia, for the five gives to the members.

02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.680
Shit.

02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:00.680
And congratulations.

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:01.680
We caught it.

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:02.680
Enjoy the emotes.

02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:05.680
I have four 10 emotes up.

02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:06.680
Wait.

02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:09.680
Just cross.

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:13.680
I have 10 emotes.

02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:19.680
The girls are getting their batch attend before me because the emotes artist is going to take

02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:20.680
a month to do them.

02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:25.680
And I'm crying internally when she told me that because, ouch, why a month?

02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:26.680
It hurts.

02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:28.680
And they increased the price as well.

02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:29.680
It sucks even more.

02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:32.680
Because I like when emotes all look the same.

02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:33.680
Like where it's clearly.

02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:35.680
What the heck am I supposed to do?

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:36.680
Ah!

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:37.680
Wait.

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:41.680
Was I not meant to spam X?

02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:45.680
You're a capture.

02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:46.680
Oh, okay.

02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:47.680
Oh, no.

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:53.680
You don't lose lives in bonus levels, though?

02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:54.680
No.

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:58.680
So what am I supposed to do?

02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:01.680
Yeah, that's exactly what I just tried to do.

02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:02.680
But it didn't like it.

02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:03.680
Oh, sorry.

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:04.680
I'm like hanging all these away.

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:06.680
So go up and then.

02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:07.680
Coco.

02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.680
Coco.

02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:09.680
Coco Chanel.

02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:10.680
I'm going to start.

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:13.680
I need to work with your manager because what's going on here?

02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:14.680
Coco.

02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:15.680
Double jump.

02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:16.680
And then X, X, X.

02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:17.680
And then that's exactly what.

02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:18.680
Ah!

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:23.680
Of course there's a TNT there just to ruin my day.

02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:24.680
Right.

02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:27.680
We're not going to double jump.

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:28.680
Ah!

02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:29.680
Coco.

02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:30.680
Coco.

02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:32.680
Coco Chanel.

02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:38.680
Number five is the top leading women's perfume in sales.

02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:41.680
It's just a fun fact.

02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:43.680
I think it is anyway.

02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:46.680
Right, go away.

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:47.680
Double jump.

02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:52.680
I don't know why this is getting so hard.

02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:53.680
Right.

02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:57.680
Right.

02:06:57.680 --> 02:06:58.680
So you do it that way.

02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:00.680
So go and do it that way then.

02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:01.680
Coco!

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:02.680
Oh my God.

02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:04.680
Why are you not doing it that way?

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:07.680
Why are you not doing it that way?

02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:11.680
Why are you not doing it that way?

02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:12.680
You did it the other way.

02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:15.680
So why won't you do it that way?

02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:21.680
Right.

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:23.680
Double jump.

02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:24.680
Oh sorry.

02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:27.680
I'm like throwing all these apples away.

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:28.680
Right.

02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:29.680
Not apples.

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:30.680
So fly and then X.

02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:31.680
No.

02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:32.680
Right.

02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:33.680
That didn't work.

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:34.680
So fly up and then.

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:35.680
No.

02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:36.680
Why?

02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:37.680
Sorry.

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.680
I need to practice doing it this way.

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:42.680
But it's actually not doing it that way.

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:43.680
It's not.

02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:49.680
Right.

02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:50.680
I'm just going to spam A and X.

02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:51.680
Oh, it worked.

02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:52.680
It worked.

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:54.680
I literally just spammed A and X.

02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:55.680
I'm so smart.

02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:58.680
I don't know what the input controls are supposed to be.

02:07:58.680 --> 02:07:59.680
Ah!

02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:04.680
You know what?

02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:05.680
You know what?

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:06.680
See this game?

02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:08.680
I have to go do that section all over again.

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:11.680
Because they put a freaking spike over that jump.

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:12.680
Oh!

02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:15.680
And I've just lost my wheat oogabogamask.

02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:16.680
Bruv.

02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:18.680
Bruv.

02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:20.680
I'm getting ruled.

02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:22.680
I'll blame it.

02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:23.680
I'll blame it.

02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:25.680
My room is actually getting pretty warm right now.

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:26.680
Right.

02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:27.680
Just spam A and X.

02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:28.680
Okay.

02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:30.680
We'll try again.

02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:31.680
We'll try again.

02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:32.680
We'll try again.

02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:33.680
Wait.

02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:36.680
Does the game know I'm struggling so it gives me a free mask?

02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:39.680
I was like, oh, again with the tea.

02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:40.680
The Nitro.

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:41.680
My goodness.

02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:44.680
Alright, hold on.

02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:49.680
I don't...

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:54.680
I'm trying to observe what I'm doing wrong.

02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:58.680
No.

02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:00.680
Is that it?

02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:02.680
No!

02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:03.680
Okay.

02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:05.680
Okay.

02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:07.680
I know not to go now.

02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:08.680
Right.

02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:09.680
Spikes.

02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:11.680
And jump on his doodle hair.

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:12.680
And then jump on that.

02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:14.680
And then destroy everything and we did it.

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:15.680
Okay.

02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:16.680
Jeez.

02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:17.680
That was terrible.

02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:18.680
That was a rough one.

02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:19.680
That was a rough one.

02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:23.680
The game giving me a free mask because I'm so bad.

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:24.680
You get the petty mask?

02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:25.680
No.

02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:27.680
That's terrible.

02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:28.680
But I got the crystal.

02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:29.680
That's the main thing.

02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:31.680
18.

02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:33.680
I did that one.

02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:34.680
19.

02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:35.680
I just did.

02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:36.680
So, 20.

02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:39.680
Oh my god, we're getting there.

02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:40.680
Tomb wader.

02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:42.680
More like, womb raider.

02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:43.680
Am I right?

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:49.680
Thank you.

02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:52.680
How many lives lost now?

02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:53.680
Far too many.

02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:57.680
Oh, there's scarabs.

02:09:58.680 --> 02:09:59.680
Whoa, what are you?

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:02.680
Oh.

02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:03.680
Oh.

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:05.680
Okay.

02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:06.680
There's water.

02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:08.680
I guess I drowned in this game.

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:10.680
Right.

02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:11.680
I guess I can't.

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:12.680
What are you?

02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:15.680
No.

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:16.680
You're freaky.

02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:18.680
Okay.

02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:19.680
That actually worked.

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:20.680
I don't know how.

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:24.680
Wah, wah, wah.

02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:25.680
Coco can't swim.

02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:26.680
I'm gonna.

02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:27.680
Let's get another one.

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:31.680
We'll stand on this box and let the water rise.

02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:36.680
Please keep me trying a better one.

02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:39.680
Oh, I don't like you.

02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:40.680
Oh, go away.

02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:43.680
Oh, what are you?

02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:51.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:52.680
That's what I thought.

02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:53.680
Right.

02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:55.680
If bonus levels cause me to perish,

02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:57.680
I'm not really that fast for them.

02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:01.680
Okay, hold on up.

02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:03.680
Coco, up before you drown.

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:05.680
Oh, go, go, go.

02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:17.680
Oh.

02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:19.680
Wait, did that just go down?

02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:20.680
I did.

02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:22.680
Sorry, I'm trying to like,

02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:24.680
peek ahead around the corner of the level

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:26.680
to be like, hmm, what comes up next?

02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:28.680
Oh my God, no.

02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:29.680
Not now, not now.

02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.680
Wait, you don't drown?

02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:33.680
Of course you don't drown.

02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:34.680
Cause why would you?

02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:36.680
But me?

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.680
I perish.

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:38.680
Oh wait, I'm gonna get this life

02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:39.680
cause I'm doing so bad.

02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:40.680
I need the lives.

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:41.680
I need the lives.

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.680
Getting bonks back and forth.

02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:46.680
Right, but 16 lives.

02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:50.680
Right.

02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:52.680
I'm trying to explode some contact.

02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:54.680
Got another bonus level?

02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:56.680
Oh no, that's a death level.

02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:05.680
Oh my God, I don't like time missions.

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.680
They make me scared.

02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:09.680
But we made it.

02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:10.680
Oh, we got the gym.

02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:15.680
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:16.680
I'm so sorry.

02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:18.680
I would like, commentate a bit more,

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:19.680
but I'm actually getting stressed

02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:20.680
out playing this game.

02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:21.680
Right, I need this platform.

02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:25.680
The timing missions are like the worst.

02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:29.680
Cool, cool.

02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:30.680
Oh, checkpoint.

02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:31.680
Right, that's all I needed.

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:34.680
Right, what are my recent saints?

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:36.680
Sorry, I'm like hardly reges at all.

02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:39.680
Getting bonks back and forth.

02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:42.680
A staring contest with a freaking game, honestly.

02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:45.680
I believe the science assistants are robots.

02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:47.680
Oh my God, we're getting secret hidden lore

02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:48.680
that I don't know about.

02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:49.680
Whoa, what was that up there?

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:50.680
I saw that.

02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:52.680
I don't think I didn't see that.

02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:53.680
Exactly.

02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:54.680
What did I just do?

02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:55.680
Whoa.

02:12:58.680 --> 02:12:59.680
Is it this I just unlocked?

02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:02.680
I think I probably just did that, yeah.

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:04.680
Ain't no way I'm jumping over those nitros.

02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:06.680
They're going to explode.

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:10.680
I'm not even bothering to attack him.

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:16.680
Oh, can I make it in time?

02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:18.680
Please don't crush me.

02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:19.680
Okay, I made it, I made it.

02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:21.680
Oh, there's TNT ahead.

02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.680
Honestly, I thought this game was going to take eight hours,

02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:29.680
but it must be eight hours if you're 100%

02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:31.680
and like go back and do everything.

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:37.680
But yeah, I think we're probably going to be redirecting

02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:38.680
to any of this.

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:41.680
If I'm blasting through the game like this,

02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:44.680
it honestly would do me quite well

02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:47.680
because I need to go up with the girls asmr.

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.680
Whoa, that per beetle just got absolutely annihilated.

02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:52.680
Bonk.

02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:59.680
Yes, Mercy and AC's meme asmr.

02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:02.680
I'd be told I'm allowed to push,

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:04.680
I'm allowed to publish, so hopefully they do quite well.

02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:05.680
Right.

02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:09.680
Oh, let's go, Coco, you're doing amazing.

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:12.680
Right, we are going against Doctor...

02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:14.680
Oh, engine.

02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:16.680
Oh, I get it, I get it.

02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:20.680
Let's hope I don't perish.

02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:25.680
So, you want to go with your rhymes?

02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:30.680
When this is over, we'll see who is obsolete.

02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:33.680
Wah, my Tommy.

02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:34.680
My Tommy.

02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:39.680
Eh?

02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:41.680
Eh?

02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.680
Ooh!

02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:45.680
What am I to do?

02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:49.680
I don't know what I'm to do, my shirt is willy.

02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:52.680
Oh, my God.

02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:55.680
I'm just spraying, I'm just spraying,

02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:57.680
staying out of the way, holy crap.

02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:00.680
The rockets are fricking locking onto me!

02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:04.680
Why is he shooting from his winky, though?

02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:06.680
I've not been funny.

02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:10.680
I don't know what I'm supposed to shoot at,

02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:13.680
and then I'm getting shot at really badly.

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:17.680
Eh?

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:20.680
No, nothing's happening to his health.

02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:25.680
Maybe something's gonna happen after this attack sequence?

02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:30.680
Oh, his winky single.

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:31.680
Oh, okay, I did it.

02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:33.680
I destroyed his winky.

02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:36.680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you're hurting me, you're hurting me.

02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:39.680
Okay, this one next.

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.680
Okay, okay, I see it's coming together, it's coming together.

02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:44.680
I just need you to aim a bit better.

02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:46.680
Am I to aim at his guns?

02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:48.680
No, this cannot be right.

02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:51.680
Although it kind of looks like I'm supposed to aim at his guns,

02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:53.680
you know that.

02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:56.680
Oh, but how am I supposed to do that without getting aimed at?

02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:00.680
Oh, I'm not sure about that.

02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:02.680
This?

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:06.680
Oh, it is, it is, this is guns, it's yellow, shoot the yellow.

02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:09.680
Oh, my God, the yellow paint before yellow paint was a thing.

02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:12.680
Oh, my God, Crash Bandicoot, you were before your time.

02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:15.680
You were truly before your time.

02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:18.680
Oh, I hardly got any licks in on that one.

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:29.680
I don't want to get in that way, but...

02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:33.680
Okay, they're both sparking, so we're doing good.

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:36.680
I'll let him get as we spray out.

02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:40.680
I'll go up so he can't get at me.

02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:46.680
Oh, wow, his thing is really strong.

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:52.680
I can't really spray into him.

02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:55.680
Okay, there we go, there we go, there we go, one more.

02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.680
Oh, my God, we did it!

02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:01.680
Oh, my God, we did it, we're so freaking good at this game.

02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:05.680
Oh.

02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:07.680
Uh...

02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:09.680
Uh...

02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:14.680
Pura! Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura!

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:19.680
Pura's gonna help me!

02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:23.680
We love Pura!

02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:30.680
Okay, I'm literally just doing 360s to try and avoid any enemies and just do, like, tag damage.

02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:37.680
Oh, my God, Pura is helping me so much.

02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:45.680
Wait, that thing is getting closer to me, whatever that is, oh, it went behind me.

02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:48.680
Uh, what the heck?

02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:51.680
I don't know what's going on with that.

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:53.680
What?

02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.680
Oh, Poodle, you're helping me so much, darling.

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:00.680
Poodle love.

02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:02.680
We love Poodle out here.

02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:06.680
Oh my god, yes!

02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:09.680
We did it!

02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:18.680
To fire fruit at a target, hold left mouse button to raise a gun and then aim with the direction and press B.

02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:22.680
Wait, I actually do unlock a crossbow in Crash Bandicoot?

02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:25.680
No way, that's so good.

02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:30.680
I got nervous when I saw a face too, not gonna lie, I was like, eww, my confidence is making.

02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:38.680
Uh huh.

02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:45.680
Oh my aching head.

02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:48.680
I'm not feeling myself these days.

02:18:48.680 --> 02:18:51.680
So the end is in sight.

02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:56.680
Gather another five crystals and again you will foil my plan.

02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:58.680
Or will you?

02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:00.680
He's got veneers.

02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:08.680
Right, no, we're, wait, so we're falling for his trap if we keep progressing.

02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:10.680
Wait, I've got my laptop and my laptop.

02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:12.680
I have two laptops.

02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:15.680
You're such an MLG gamer, Coco.

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.680
We're doing it!

02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:20.680
Gone tomorrow.

02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:23.680
News today, gone tomorrow.

02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:24.680
That's the saying.

02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:27.680
Are all the levels after a saying or like a pun?

02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:29.680
Honestly, me.

02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:32.680
Cortex is depressed for a throw.

02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:33.680
What's going on here?

02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:35.680
Double jump.

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:37.680
Double jump.

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:39.680
Double jump.

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:44.680
Oh, I don't like that.

02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:47.680
Wait, double jump.

02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:49.680
I guess you do even like.

02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:51.680
Oh, I don't like that.

02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:53.680
That's awfully menacing.

02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:55.680
What do you do?

02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:04.680
Oh wait, what was this?

02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:05.680
I can unlock now.

02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:07.680
I think I can throw food.

02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:10.680
Oh, Coco!

02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:14.680
Coco!

02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:17.680
What on earth is that?

02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:23.680
Coco, that's offensively large and hilarious.

02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:25.680
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:27.680
Sorry, I like jumped right into that.

02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:30.680
Coco, that's not even a gun.

02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:32.680
That's a rocket launcher.

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:35.680
Oh my gosh.

02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:38.680
Wait, does this make the game like way easier though?

02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:40.680
It does!

02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:42.680
Oh my god, do you see that aim ball?

02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:44.680
I could...

02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:48.680
I will safely get past.

02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:52.680
Bro, Coco, that was so violent.

02:20:52.680 --> 02:20:56.680
Honestly, she's done asking nicely.

02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:57.680
She's had enough.

02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:00.680
She's like, bro, get me out of this game.

02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:05.680
What, do this?

02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:07.680
Oh no, I broke the box.

02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:13.680
Oh my god, I didn't know you had a rocket launcher in Crash Bandicoot.

02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:16.680
I definitely did not get this far into the game.

02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:21.680
There's a child, there's a wean, there's a speckle, honestly.

02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:25.680
I was probably a molecule when I was playing this.

02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:28.680
I'm just the best in Bandicoot with a rocket launcher.

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:33.680
I thought of that meme, but there's like, nah, there's no way I can bring it up.

02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:35.680
I'll have to let everyone bring it up.

02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:37.680
Hold on, nah.

02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:40.680
I can like aim to the sides like this.

02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:43.680
Thank you, Lord of Strongs for the five gifted membership.

02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:46.680
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:49.680
You'll have to enable membership gifting.

02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:51.680
You might get a prompt in chat if you don't have it enabled,

02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:54.680
but congrats to those, you can use my emotes now.

02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:57.680
Wait, oh my god.

02:21:57.680 --> 02:21:59.680
I'm getting you.

02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:03.680
Oh, it's out of bounds off, can't wait one.

02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:10.680
Oh my god, I can destroy TNT from afar as well.

02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:14.680
I don't know why I went up, I could have been blue.

02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:22.680
Oh my god, this makes the game so easy.

02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:24.680
I love it here.

02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:27.680
I love fresh Bandicoot.

02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:33.680
Or Coco can't Bandicoot because Coco Pog.

02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:35.680
Wow, I almost got done.

02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:39.680
Congrats on those who caught the member.

02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:41.680
Wow, see it worked that time,

02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:46.680
but every other time I try to do the fluffy effect and fly, it never works.

02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:49.680
She didn't manage to do another two games.

02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:52.680
I have never actually played the other two games,

02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:56.680
so I don't know what the experience is like.

02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:00.680
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to get rid of all those asses.

02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:02.680
Oh my god, the game is so kind.

02:23:02.680 --> 02:23:05.680
It doesn't even go against your ammo.

02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:08.680
Can I shoot you now?

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:09.680
No.

02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:11.680
Okay, I have to do the dodge.

02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:21.680
I'm freaking loving this game.

02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:24.680
Oh my gosh, it's so well put together.

02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:26.680
Other than the race in one's bus,

02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:28.680
because I'm dumb and can't figure it out.

02:23:28.680 --> 02:23:31.680
Ale vivas.

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:33.680
Ale vivas.

02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:35.680
Thank you for coming on Membo.

02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:37.680
And Lord of the Drums again.

02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:39.680
For the gifted membership.

02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:43.680
Me and the Reeflings.

02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:48.680
Just as I was complaining about a race in the mission.

02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:51.680
Ah.

02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:55.680
It's the last one though.

02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:58.680
It's the last race in mission.

02:23:58.680 --> 02:24:03.680
Surely.

02:24:03.680 --> 02:24:04.680
Surely.

02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:06.680
Two and then go.

02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:10.680
Right, I got the boost.

02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:13.680
The police are doing nothing.

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:15.680
Oh, I never even saw that.

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:19.680
Oh my god, I need my glasses on so badly.

02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:26.680
Would you still love me as a streamer if I never put my...

02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:28.680
I'm trying to hold it together.

02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:31.680
I'm trying to hold it together.

02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:35.680
I'm at the absurdity that is these maps.

02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:36.680
For racing.

02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:38.680
I'm literally seventh place.

02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:43.680
There's no way.

02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:45.680
There's no way I've got this.

02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:46.680
I refuse.

02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:50.680
Yeah, get in my way.

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:53.680
Okay, everyone's using the ramp which is fine.

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:54.680
I'll use it too.

02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:57.680
Okay, you're going to have to use the ramp.

02:24:57.680 --> 02:24:59.680
Because of the...

02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:00.680
Bro.

02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:02.680
These AI police cars!

02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:07.680
Bro, you can't even reverse in this game.

02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:12.680
Reeflings, I'm going to have to send my game file to one of you right now.

02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:16.680
And then you send me it back complete and I'll go do the other missions while I'm at it.

02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:20.680
Because this is ridiculous.

02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:26.680
Why did they make the freaking driving one so hard?

02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:33.680
And Crash, if you didn't stop skating everywhere across the map, we're actually going to have issues.

02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:35.680
Out my road.

02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:36.680
Okay, well that was terrible.

02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:38.680
Please don't ever do that again.

02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:40.680
I'm fifth place.

02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:44.680
Oh, and I missed it!

02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:47.680
Okay, the AI can actually go off road which is interesting.

02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:49.680
I didn't know that.

02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:53.680
The AI is adapting and I'm getting nervous.

02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:55.680
Why are they...

02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:58.680
Oh, and I missed it again.

02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:00.680
I'm fourth place.

02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:02.680
Honestly, that wasn't awful.

02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:03.680
I'm wondering...

02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:04.680
Right, we'll keep doing it.

02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:05.680
We'll keep doing it.

02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:06.680
We'll keep doing it.

02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:09.680
That was the first time I played the map and the first thing I did was fall off it, okay?

02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:15.680
Refillings are always thrilled to Princess Carrie and Momé, honestly.

02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:16.680
I just wish...

02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:17.680
I just...

02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:18.680
I just...

02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:20.680
I'm getting filtered by a child, okay?

02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:23.680
Three, two, and then hold, boost.

02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:28.680
Okay, and then on the left side there is already an issue.

02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:35.680
So the AI is actually choosing to go off the map, which is curious.

02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:39.680
I didn't think the AI did such a thing.

02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:42.680
Very curious indeed.

02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:47.680
Yeah, they're all avoiding the pull-offs.

02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:49.680
So just take it easy.

02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:51.680
These corners didn't do so...

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:54.680
Yeah, I didn't do so hot in these corners.

02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:56.680
Wah!

02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:59.680
I'll take that boost though.

02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:00.680
I'll take that boost.

02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:02.680
Thank you.

02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:05.680
I have to take this ramp because there is a gap.

02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:06.680
You will not make it.

02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:07.680
Go Minasori.

02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:10.680
You will not make it if you take that gap.

02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:12.680
It's okay.

02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:13.680
No!

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:14.680
Fenderbender!

02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:16.680
Fenderbender!

02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:18.680
That's illegal.

02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:20.680
You have to stop and call the police!

02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:25.680
Aw, fuck this.

02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:27.680
Okay, hold on.

02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:28.680
Can you Fenderbender?

02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:30.680
Elsewhere, please!

02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:31.680
Elsewhere.

02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:33.680
Okay.

02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:45.680
I'm trying.

02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:47.680
I'm actually trying so hard right now.

02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:50.680
I'm sweating my cheeks off.

02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:53.680
I'm sweating my panties off, but you all know what's happening with that.

02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:55.680
Oh, I might do it!

02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:57.680
Oh my god, I might do it.

02:27:57.680 --> 02:27:59.680
Oh my god, just don't...

02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:01.680
No!

02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:09.680
My mouth is a gap from how hard I'm trying right now.

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:10.680
Oh!

02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:12.680
Oh my god, I did it in two!

02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:14.680
Oh!

02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:15.680
Thank god.

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:16.680
Thank god.

02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:17.680
Oh my god.

02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:20.680
That was so freaking hard.

02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:23.680
Literally maximum mouth breathing.

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:27.680
All wrinkly parts of my brain were locked in.

02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:31.680
All the smooth parts of my brain were told to be quiet momentarily.

02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:33.680
Oh my goodness, Gravy.

02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:37.680
Thank god I never have to do a racing mission again.

02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:38.680
Oh.

02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:42.680
Victoire!

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:43.680
Victoire.

02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:45.680
Oh lolol.

02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:48.680
Oh, such a good game.

02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:49.680
I'm sorry.

02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:50.680
I'm absolutely loving this.

02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:52.680
I highly recommend it, Revenge.

02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:57.680
If you have got some money to spare right now

02:28:57.680 --> 02:28:59.680
and you want to give a game-ish...

02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:00.680
Hey!

02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:02.680
I was on top of your heat.

02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:06.680
I heavily recommend getting the V-Master Crash Bandicoot

02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:09.680
because this is just fun.

02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:11.680
I have to wait until the Knife Man goes away

02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:14.680
and then I don't come this way.

02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:15.680
Great.

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:16.680
Flamethrower?

02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:17.680
I'm just fine.

02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:20.680
Oh, the guy's gone now.

02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:22.680
The game helps you if you're rubbish as well,

02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:24.680
which is even better.

02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:26.680
The game is holding my hand.

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:29.680
Oh my god, I can't believe a refling made this game just for me

02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:32.680
because they knew how much I struggle.

02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:33.680
Oh my god, reflins.

02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:34.680
You're actually so selfless.

02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:36.680
It's stunning.

02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:38.680
You're so polite.

02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:40.680
We've got a checkpoint.

02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:42.680
What's going on here?

02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:43.680
I made it anyway.

02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:45.680
I don't know what's going on, but I made it anyway.

02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:46.680
There's a little thing to the right.

02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:48.680
I'm tempted to go explore,

02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:51.680
but we'll go explore to the right.

02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:52.680
What's over here?

02:29:52.680 --> 02:29:56.680
Don't think I didn't see that.

02:29:56.680 --> 02:29:59.680
I thought it was a hidden thing to the right.

02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:00.680
And it's not.

02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:03.680
You're telling me it's not a hidden area to the right?

02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:08.680
Bro, I'm sorry, but reflins are pranking me.

02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:11.680
I can't believe you got in the dev team just to prank me, bro.

02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:13.680
Whoa, there's TNT there.

02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:15.680
I want to interact with none of that.

02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:16.680
I want none of this.

02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:19.680
I want any problems.

02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:20.680
I don't want peace.

02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:24.680
I want to problem me giving myself more work is literally that mean.

02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:25.680
I don't want peace.

02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:34.680
I want problems.

02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:37.680
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we ain't going.

02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:40.680
We ain't going until you go.

02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:44.680
Prince Ali, mighty is he.

02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:48.680
Oh, blah, blah, blah.

02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:52.680
Show some respect for you.

02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:55.680
Oh, that's not a platform.

02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:56.680
Okay.

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:58.680
Sorry, there's not a platform there.

02:30:58.680 --> 02:31:01.680
Oops.

02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:04.680
Oh, and I missed.

02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:07.680
I think Coco just like constantly has her laptop on her.

02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:08.680
She's like, yeah, I need this.

02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:09.680
Honestly, it's safe.

02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:14.680
I'm like, bro, but I need internet access to all things.

02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:15.680
Okay.

02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:16.680
Flamethrower, that's fine.

02:31:16.680 --> 02:31:20.680
Do not go on the fake platform that isn't a real platform.

02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:21.680
Okay.

02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:29.680
You're going to be sorely disappointed that to find there's nothing.

02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:34.680
Whoa, that was actually really lucky timing.

02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:37.680
What's going on here?

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:39.680
I think the camera angles.

02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:41.680
At first, I actually didn't like that.

02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:44.680
I couldn't control that camera angle, but now I'm like, I get it now.

02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:48.680
This is actually pretty, pretty nice.

02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:54.680
This is pretty rewarding.

02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:56.680
As much as we love a cheeky.

02:31:56.680 --> 02:31:58.680
Oh, wow.

02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:03.680
How often do you throw?

02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:04.680
Right.

02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:05.680
Okay.

02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:12.680
I saw him peek and I was like, I'm about to get in trouble.

02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:13.680
Right.

02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:15.680
Jump and then jump again.

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:16.680
Okay.

02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:17.680
We're getting there.

02:32:17.680 --> 02:32:18.680
We're getting there refunds.

02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:19.680
Oh my God.

02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:20.680
An extra life.

02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:21.680
Don't mind me.

02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:26.680
The only thing I don't miss from the era is the time control.

02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:28.680
Oh my God.

02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:32.680
We're absolutely smoking.

02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:35.680
We're smoking and no tobacco is needed.

02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:38.680
Okay.

02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:40.680
Wow.

02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:43.680
So we only got two more levels and it's a boss fight.

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:45.680
Mad Bomba.

02:32:45.680 --> 02:32:47.680
Bombadier.

02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:48.680
Remember your bazooka.

02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:50.680
Oh, I already forgot I had one.

02:32:50.680 --> 02:32:52.680
Crash Coco.

02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:56.680
Remember, it is not only Dr. Cortex that we battle.

02:32:56.680 --> 02:33:00.680
Beware of Uka Uka, my children.

02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:07.680
He is a far more dangerous enemy than anyone can imagine.

02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:09.680
Oh no.

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:12.680
That's not good.

02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:14.680
Shoot down the Bombadier.

02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:16.680
Shoot down the bombers.

02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:21.680
Like these planes that can shoot me.

02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:22.680
Oh my God.

02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:27.680
We're committing artillery warfare.

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:34.680
Get that plane done.

02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:37.680
I'm going to just do this.

02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:38.680
Are you a badie?

02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:40.680
Yeah, you are.

02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:46.680
Okay, so I can shoot the enemies as they appear and then I don't get hit by them.

02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:48.680
Okay, that's pretty good to know.

02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:52.680
Man, this one was so far away.

02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:54.680
Okay, there we go.

02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:59.680
Destroy this guy completely wholeheartedly.

02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:04.680
I did see someone's one in there, but I think we're okay.

02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:05.680
Okay, there we go.

02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:06.680
I'll take the health now.

02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:11.680
I don't know if that was a bit too preemptive, but we're doing it.

02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:12.680
Oh, I see him.

02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:13.680
I see him.

02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:14.680
I see him.

02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:15.680
I see him.

02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:16.680
I see him.

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:21.680
He was going to become a Kazian.

02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:22.680
Jeez.

02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:26.680
Okay, we're getting there.

02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:28.680
We've got two more bombardiers.

02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:29.680
What?

02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:31.680
Sorry, the controls are inverted.

02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:36.680
Sorry, I'm used to the controls being inverted for this.

02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:38.680
Man, I'm absolutely smoking.

02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:40.680
Sorry, I'm actually so good at this child game.

02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:44.680
I need head pads for how good I am at destroying this child game.

02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:54.680
I need accolades to forever recognize me as so good at beating up this game.

02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:57.680
It's fantastic.

02:34:57.680 --> 02:34:58.680
We did it.

02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:00.680
Okay, we almost did it.

02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:01.680
Wait, hold on.

02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:02.680
Let me turn around.

02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:04.680
Let me just get these guys first.

02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:05.680
Turn around.

02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:10.680
Every now and then I get to see you.

02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:11.680
Oh my goodness.

02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:13.680
Oh, I'm getting head pads.

02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:15.680
You're in so good moment.

02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:16.680
Good girl.

02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:20.680
I was thinking of Sly Culver too.

02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:22.680
You regularly get the petty mask.

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:23.680
No, don't point that out.

02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:24.680
Don't tell them that.

02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:26.680
No one needs to know that.

02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:31.680
I don't get the petty mask that much, okay?

02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:34.680
Okay, I just did that.

02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:35.680
What's this?

02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:40.680
A bug light, not to be confused with a bug's life.

02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:42.680
Okay, you're doing great.

02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:43.680
Thank you, Reflink.

02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:45.680
This game is absolutely fantastic.

02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:46.680
I cannot recommend this enough.

02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:51.680
I may actually recommend the girls play it just because you don't really need any previous

02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:53.680
knowledge other than that first dinosaur.

02:35:53.680 --> 02:36:07.680
I was having a stroke trying to figure out how to get the dinosaur to not coblame on me.

02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:11.680
I've got a little guide for the girls that has a list of the games that they can play

02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:17.680
based on complexity, but I actually need to make it a much better list because I need

02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:23.680
to add how long it takes to play or these temporary areas.

02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:27.680
Oh, it's Navi.

02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:29.680
Oh, wait.

02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:33.680
Oh my God, I have my own light source.

02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:37.680
It's beautiful.

02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:40.680
All right, double jump, X, and we're safe.

02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:44.680
Oh, this is beautiful.

02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:46.680
Another light for me?

02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:47.680
Oh, he got tired.

02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:48.680
He needs to go to bed.

02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:49.680
That's okay.

02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:52.680
You don't have to do this for your entire life.

02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:54.680
Oh, I keep throwing my apples away.

02:36:54.680 --> 02:36:55.680
Oopsie.

02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:01.680
Hmm, how far away did I just get put back?

02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:04.680
Oh, I'll get masked right next to this one point.

02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:07.680
Johnny's been fine, but most importantly, she's enjoying herself.

02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:08.680
Everyone's happy.

02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:09.680
Stream is bliss.

02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:10.680
Oh, that's so precious.

02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:13.680
I'm glad you guys are happy.

02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:19.680
Oh, I keep throwing away me one for fruit.

02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:20.680
Okay.

02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:24.680
You can now go into retirement and then I'll take you.

02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:26.680
And then what did I do wrong here?

02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:27.680
I already forgot.

02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:28.680
What's that?

02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:33.680
No, Coco, you're spinning everywhere.

02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:34.680
Okay.

02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:36.680
Jump and then double jump.

02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:37.680
See?

02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:38.680
Nice and simple.

02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:43.680
Biggest enemies are literally jumping in this game.

02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:44.680
No other reason.

02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:45.680
Okay.

02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:46.680
Whoa.

02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:47.680
No, it's dark.

02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:48.680
Oh, hello.

02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:49.680
I cannot see.

02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:50.680
I cannot see.

02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:51.680
Please do not leave me alone.

02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:52.680
Oh, okay.

02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:53.680
Wow.

02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:54.680
Wow.

Wow.

02:37:57.680 --> 02:37:58.680
Wow.

02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:00.680
Okay.

02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:01.680
Whoa.

02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:02.680
Whoa.

Whoa.

02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:05.680
Whoa.

Whoa.

02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:08.680
Whoa.

02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:09.680
Oh my God.

02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:10.680
Oh my God.

I'm sort MLG pro.

02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:13.680
You literally can't stop me.

02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:15.680
How long does this last for?

02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:21.680
Oh, it literally ended just as I walloped that enemy.

02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:23.680
Holy crap.

02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:24.680
Okay.

02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:26.680

Okay, I can't believe you're playing crash Bandicoot. I'm playing childhood games

02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:42.520

Been trying to do one childhood game

02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:28.680
Oh

No, oh my god, they're battling it out the tiki masks are going for it

02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:55.640

I do I need to jump over it. Oh, I need to jump over their laser beam if they get in the way

02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:11.520
No tiki man's trying to help me out, but the baddie is all the way while you're putting yo C4

02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:14.320
Why are you putting C4 on the ground? Oh?

02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:21.160
Wait, oh, no, I was supposed to wall up him his shield was down. I'm sorry. I missed that cue

02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:28.480
I don't I don't think I ever I highly doubt I actually got past the second stage

02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:29.640
I

02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:34.680
Cuz I didn't really remember anything right. He throws these and they explode and

02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:37.600
His shield was there

02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:41.400
What does it mean go in go in go in go in?

02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:45.400
Okay, okay, okay, we've got it. We know what the mechanic is

Am I to go in? No, okay. I was actually about to go in that hole. I'm not gonna lie

02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:54.320
Okay, they're gonna battle now

Right when he puts mines then that's when I can make a move. Okay now. I don't know if the AI locks onto me

02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:21.800
I'm gonna get in and hole and hole and hole and hole and hole in the hole. All right. Oh

No, no, no, no, don't do that. Okay. Okay, it's fine. We're safe

02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:54.720

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:33.040
I am blown away by this game. Obviously. I had a chance to play it in childhood

02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:36.560
So there was a lot of nostalgia associated with the game

02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:41.680
But this have always nothing but a short of fantastic a lovely experience

02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:49.280
Truly the game didn't feel feel like it was going on too long if you enjoy it. You can also a hundred percent it and

Just ten out of ten all-round type of game

02:49:53.960 --> 02:50:00.120
For me helps with a short attention span helps that was designed for kids to play helps that was beautiful

02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:07.360
Colorful and everything is so interactive. Do you have any plans to play the newest crash game crash board?

02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:09.280
It's about time. I've never played it

02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:16.360
Um, but I would understand why not if it's anything if any of the other crash games are like this that they're quick

02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:21.960
Wham-bam, they've got fun little interactive mini games inside like the different levels. Sure

02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:25.280

Count me in

02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:26.760
Yeah, crash 4 is actually pretty hard. Okay, maybe not. Maybe we'll just pause on crash 4

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:28.320
Just for now

02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:31.000
Yes, go pyro would be fun

02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:35.320

Hope in the end of credits and it says and thank you the fans

02:51:45.880 --> 02:51:48.760
I'm allowed to say a spoiler for the video game

02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:51.360
The vealer video game

02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:03.800
Sure say the spoiler, okay, this is for only people who are watching the stream at

02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:06.640
The end of the vealer video game

02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:14.480
You hear a voiceline from all of us and we say and thank you the player after you have just put one hand at our game

02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:19.920
Because I love it so much in video games. I was like, I'm having it in this game

02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:27.880
Trial wait, are these speedrunners? No trial testers one hour. Wait, why is it showing time? I

02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:30.520
Don't know what the times are for

02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:37.560
Okay, let's go. Yeah after we finish the game literally all of us come on and we all go. Thank you the player

02:52:38.760 --> 02:52:40.080
and

02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:42.080
Oh, these are the devs

02:52:42.920 --> 02:52:45.920
Are these the speedrun times?

02:52:46.720 --> 02:52:51.280
That's outrageous. Did they all know it can't be this is 12 minutes

02:52:52.280 --> 02:52:57.080
No one has completed the game. Maybe speedrunners. 12 minutes would be broken the game

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:03.480
The other game is designed to play one-handed. Oh, it absolutely is we can't we can hardly even talk about it

02:53:03.480 --> 02:53:07.160
I'm going to get the girls to record them playing it

02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:13.440
And then they'll upload it to their alt-twitters so they can like play it for the first time and experience it

02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:23.440
It's pair map the map names were on the left my apologies. Oh my gosh ten out of ten experience

02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:30.640
What a magnificent game what a well-rounded no wonder they remastered it

02:53:30.640 --> 02:53:35.560
So what does this do interacts swap hero save loads? That's it. We'll save

02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:37.440
and

02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:40.920
Yeah, wow just ten out of ten. Oh

02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:46.200
Wait, what did I just do? Oh, did I accidentally just load over my save? Oops

02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:53.200
It sees. Oh, it's fine. We finished the game. Anyway, I think I'm gonna mess stuff a little bit there, but it's okay. I

02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:59.680
Think I undid all my progress. Oopsies. I did all my progress. That's too busy yapping

02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:04.280
Don't worry though

02:54:04.960 --> 02:54:06.960
We all make mistakes

02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:15.600
Yeah, no, that's well, there's no point in saving because I'm already saved up. Oh, well, it's fine. It's fine. That was

02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:23.760
Fantastic, right. I'm gonna check if there's any veal or girlies on and I understand that this is a shorter stream

02:54:23.760 --> 02:54:27.640
I thought it was gonna be an eight hour stream, but I was wrong and

02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:30.320
but in exchange

02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:33.080
in exchange

02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:35.120
For a shorter stream

02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:37.800
My darling grieflings

02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:42.040
Mercy and AC's meme ASMR is gonna be uploaded at a certain time

02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:47.440
It might be timed after the stream because I think mercy asked for me to make sure it's after she finished streaming

02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:52.280
She's gonna end up all savings over the 30% also. No, no, no, no, no

02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:56.840
Emi is up in an hour. That's perfectly fine with me. Um, oh

02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:00.880
Pardon me for being so rude. I just burped there. Don't mind me

02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:09.720
Oh, no, I got kicked out of my YouTube account. Shit. Hold on. I need a fucking message management from my password

02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:14.160
Hmm

02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:16.880
Just need to message

02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:24.120
What is my YouTube password, please? I'm locked out. I'm locked out. I don't know why I locked me out

02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:29.120
Oh, do excuse me. Oh

02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:36.520

02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:59.400
God, I can't go for that. Right. Emi is going to be up in T

02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:01.640

02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:03.640
T minus what?

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:06.520
T minus what?

02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:11.640
An hour. Oh my god, I have no hour to yeah, don't mind if I do

02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:16.120
Oops, no, I definitely do not want to end stream from the dashboard

02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:22.200
Please don't give me that option. That scared me. Don't do that again YouTube. Please don't do that again. You're stressing me out

02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:29.320
Hey, I'm just gonna make sure I'm redirecting into any piezo because her monetization stream

02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:35.960
Is monetization celebrate celebration

02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:39.800

I give up. I give up. Um, Emi Emi Emi monetization celebration

02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:49.240
And

02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:54.440
Yes, okay, it says save so when I end my stream

02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:58.040
God, I can't get over how fantastic that game was

02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:03.240
Uh, what's going on?

02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:12.440
Why have I got so many comments on that new ASMR video? Well, I'll show you the stats again

02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:21.400
I'll show you the stats on that. I don't know. Uh, hopefully I'm praying that the girls's mean videos also get as popular as mine because

02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:28.760
That that got really popular for like no reason. Oh my god. I don't want to brag or anything. Hold on

02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:32.120
Let me let me screenshot so I can show you guys the dirty details

02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:38.120
The dirty details the the oh, sorry. I just blurt flash behind myself trying to save this file save file

02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:45.800
That one. Uh, actually, I can just take off the reactive model. That's probably a bit better of an idea. Don't you think?

02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:51.960
Wait, so it's just a zero

02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:57.560
Um, right hold on. How do I show?

02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:02.440
How do I show this on desktop?

02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:06.600
Um

02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:10.680
What did I call the file? I've already forgotten the file name

02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:14.120
Oh, there there

02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:16.600
Okay, so this is what it said. Oh, it's there you on

02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:19.320
Bit big bit big

02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:21.640
This is what it says now on that video

02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:29.560
So congrats. You have 34,000 views, bro. Yeah, I definitely got picked up in the algorithm because I only had 5000 subscribers

02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:34.200
It says I earned 780 subscribers from it. She

02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:41.080
My that video alone reached youtube's monetization watch time

02:58:42.840 --> 02:58:47.000
Thingings it literally says 3000 watch hours. That's how much you need to get monetized

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:53.000
You need that one video alone. You need 500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours that one video alone

02:58:53.800 --> 02:58:56.040
I could submit for monetization. That's insane

02:58:56.840 --> 02:59:04.120
And also, of course, I'm breaking the bank at 20. Please don't be don't be surprised when the 3d models come out

02:59:04.120 --> 02:59:09.480
Next week because my ASMR is raking in the money. Yes. No, no, there's no 3d

02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:17.080
VTuber streams coming up just yet cost a pretty penny to get that stuff kind of dealt with

02:59:19.640 --> 02:59:23.880
Yes, there will be signs. Yes, there will be signs

02:59:24.600 --> 02:59:26.120
um

02:59:26.120 --> 02:59:30.120
But yeah, that video definitely uh is getting about

02:59:35.080 --> 02:59:38.600
That was fantastic. I can't believe it

02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:42.760
It's not yacht soon. Absolutely not. I have no desire for a yacht

02:59:43.640 --> 02:59:44.840
That is

02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:49.080
I've I just never had an interest in that kind of thing at all

02:59:49.880 --> 02:59:54.280
Right, I want to open up marshmallow, but last time I opened it up. It had a little bit of

02:59:57.720 --> 03:00:01.640
Uh, right, let me I will link my marshmallow so you're free to

03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:07.640
Penis chocolate ASMR surprisingly is popular

03:00:07.880 --> 03:00:11.960
Brian, it's not that it was pentas dorkin

03:00:12.840 --> 03:00:14.840

03:00:14.840 --> 03:00:23.480
Uh, thank you. Oh marin something for the super chat. It was me asking to hold it while you tinkle

03:00:24.360 --> 03:00:26.360
It's not pentas dorking

03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:34.600
The next audio I upload is for now. I'm I'm I'm I'm teasing I'm breezing for a teasing

03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:39.960
Dear mommy next time you go in a tinfoil. Yeah, can I join you on stream?

03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:43.320
Wait, have you have you put a little tinfoil hat on a wiefling?

03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:51.800
Oh, my little wieflings have a tinfoil hat. You're so cute. Let me put it on right now. Hold on

03:01:09.240 --> 03:01:11.240
Hold pause pause

03:01:11.480 --> 03:01:13.480
Pause don't breathe

03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:16.200
Oh

03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:23.720
Okay, you can breathe you can breathe again. Wow

03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:26.680
Wow

03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:30.920
Look, it's me and the wieflings. We're gonna take them black ropes together

03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:35.160
My little wiefling

03:01:37.480 --> 03:01:38.840
You're so good

03:01:38.840 --> 03:01:43.000
Oh my god wiefling you're actually so well placed. I can probably do this

03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:49.240
That wiefling literally I know

03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:59.240
Thank you for your helpful advice some events happen that would have hurt a lot more if I hadn't thought of you

03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:06.040
What you told me you give me strength. Oh, I don't know what advice I gave but I'm glad it could help in the moment

03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:08.360
You are

03:02:09.400 --> 03:02:11.400
very strong

03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:12.920
Your is

03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:17.800
Some sometimes you could actually say you're as strong as your weakest days because on your weakest days

03:02:17.880 --> 03:02:21.560
You just want to give up but you didn't so you're as strong as your weakest days

03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:25.400
Does that make sense?

03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:28.200
I don't know. Maybe it does

03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:35.800
Keep your keep your chin up wiefling your headset's falling off king. Okay. Come on. We gamers out here. We memers

03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:38.760
We're just memers

03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:41.480
We memer low

03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:43.800
away

03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:46.360
No, it does not

03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:50.760
Looks like a hair. She's kiss leave my hair. She kissed addicted wiefling alone

03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:58.360
Hearts full balls empty should be a bit a vealers official catchphrase. That's amazing

03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:03.320
Oh bucket tape. Thank you for becoming a member

03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:05.320
Bye

03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:11.000
Membership streams are revealed next tomorrow in the next 24 hours. You will know

03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:14.200
You will know

03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:16.040
and

03:03:16.040 --> 03:03:18.040
But yeah

03:03:23.320 --> 03:03:25.320
My mouse

03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:29.000
See you it's because of not actually

03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:32.280
Right, hold on. Let me I'll tell you some lore in a minute

03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:35.800
The reason my mouse does that

03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:42.280
Is because the light and is very low as well as I've actually not synced up my vtuber model

03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:47.160
Nari rigged me so well like she made me so well

03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:52.040
I actually haven't gone into the calibrations to make strongy like the

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:57.240
The mecca like reactive to the microphone or whatever

03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:03.400
Um, so like Nari is just that good. I love your fangs. Oh, yeah, do you love them enough to you know?

03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:06.840
Let me

03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:09.240
In your Frankfurt

03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:17.240
Hey, right, let me get my wee marshmallow link. Where did I even send the marshmallow link? I don't even think I did

03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:19.320
Oh my god, I'm gatekeeping my own marshmallow

03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:22.440
pay the bow

03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:24.440
Can you see?

03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:30.760
Wow, you guys can tell that I am not all there in the head from that message

03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:34.360
I am not all there in the head, but that's okay

03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:37.880
Oh

03:04:38.120 --> 03:04:41.000
Yes, you strongy. No strongy. Yes

03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:47.080
Why would you say no to me? I'm not supposed to say no to me. You know what happens when you say no

03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:49.400
This

03:04:50.680 --> 03:04:53.080
But that part comes later not yet soon

03:04:53.960 --> 03:04:56.920
But yes, um, it is a smaller stream

03:04:57.640 --> 03:05:02.760
But the smaller stream I actually thought it was going to be eight hours, but because it's not eight hours

03:05:02.840 --> 03:05:06.680
I'm actually going to have the energy to go edit. So I might have my first

03:05:06.840 --> 03:05:12.360
Thank you for 1000 audio uploaded on youtube on here for free all yours all yours

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:19.560
I will also upload the audio file to patreon as a archive to make sure nothing is lost to time itself

03:05:20.120 --> 03:05:23.560
Um, and I will take it from there

03:05:24.840 --> 03:05:26.840
my next patreon

03:05:27.960 --> 03:05:29.400
audio

03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:36.040
Should technically actually be uploaded on the 22nd, but I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna let it be a bit funny

03:05:36.360 --> 03:05:41.560
I'm gonna the first month on patreon is funny. You still get four audios on patreon, but they're just a bit funky

03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:45.880
They're spaced out a bit weird. Uh g-man stew. Thank you for coming on

03:05:47.320 --> 03:05:49.720
What happens when we say no you get hypnotized?

03:05:50.600 --> 03:05:52.600
You don't have a choice

03:05:53.160 --> 03:05:55.160
You don't have a choice

03:05:55.160 --> 03:05:59.160
And I don't I don't care. I don't care if that sounds our wordy. You don't have a choice

03:06:00.280 --> 03:06:04.280
But you you you'll come to learn to like that. You don't have a choice. That's terrible

03:06:04.360 --> 03:06:07.400
I can't say that stuff out loud and yet I do what happens next

03:06:08.200 --> 03:06:10.040
Hmm what happens next?

03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:13.160
Outrageous streamer says some something outrageous. Oh, oh no, okay

03:06:14.600 --> 03:06:21.480
Uh glad you enjoyed my three page story. It was so good. Maybe can I maybe read it? I'm gonna see if I can read it

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:24.760
okay

03:06:24.760 --> 03:06:29.080
Stroney has just finished taking a shower and calls her wreathlings into her room

03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:34.920
Hi there wreathlings. Stroney said oh in a sultry voice. Hi there wreathling

03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:37.640
Stroney says in a sultry voice

03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:42.760
Mummy is ovulating and it's time for a new gen

03:06:44.040 --> 03:06:47.400
Can you all last long enough to satisfy me and get the job done?

03:06:48.680 --> 03:06:51.720
She drops her towel and lies down on the bed

03:06:52.440 --> 03:06:54.280
wreathlings approach

03:06:54.280 --> 03:07:00.520
Slowly sliding a tentacle or two. I don't think I can read this. I don't think I can read this. I'm like

03:07:01.400 --> 03:07:03.400
I don't think I could substitute

03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:07.560
Slowly sliding a tentacle or two up Stroney's legs and arms

03:07:08.120 --> 03:07:13.560
And across her stomach massaging her body so she can relax after a long stream. She just finished

03:07:14.920 --> 03:07:20.280
Eventually some wrap their tent. Yeah, I can't read the rest of it. I guess really I guess really uh

03:07:22.120 --> 03:07:28.680
But um, I wouldn't actually mind if you guys want to send me like little mini scripts like that

03:07:28.680 --> 03:07:32.680
I honestly wouldn't mind just reading them and then putting them on the alt

03:07:33.720 --> 03:07:35.880
Twitter just for fun just for a little

03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:38.440
Uh something something

03:07:38.600 --> 03:07:41.400
I can't be here then somewhere. Please. Yes

03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:47.960
Um, it was a very cute story about how gen two is going to be produced with me in the replay

03:07:49.080 --> 03:07:53.960
Um, I honestly don't mind. I find that stuff adorable and my voice isn't too fried right now

03:07:53.960 --> 03:07:58.760
So I might be able to do it today. Um, do let me cook though. But yes, you guys are welcome

03:07:59.080 --> 03:08:02.120
Um for me, I don't know the comfort level of the girls yet

03:08:02.200 --> 03:08:06.600
So please don't apply what I am comfortable with to the girls. They are their own individuals

03:08:06.920 --> 03:08:08.680
They are their own creatives

03:08:08.760 --> 03:08:12.600
But if you guys ever want to send me a short script and just say please mummy

03:08:12.840 --> 03:08:20.440
Um, or if you commission an artwork of me, um, you know a strong so you're welcome to say I

03:08:21.400 --> 03:08:23.400
Or did you know I

03:08:23.560 --> 03:08:27.240
Saw this fan art and I came up with the script if you want to combine the two together

03:08:27.320 --> 03:08:32.920
Please do and put it on the alt twitter. I am happy to do that. I am very open to this. So, um

03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:38.360
And it's completely free to access. I will not, you know, pay a wallet not not not my job

03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:43.720
But I won't I won't pay wall. Um, like little short scripts and fun fans submitted

03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:48.760
Stuff. I'm a fan. I don't like the word fan. You're not a fan. You're my reflet

03:08:50.520 --> 03:08:56.520
Have the girls heard of the tinfoil right rants if so, what's the reaction? Oh, I'm too embarrassed to tell them

03:08:57.400 --> 03:09:06.840
Um, I'm too embarrassed to like tell them how much I like despise debt and credit cards and how like the economies rigged against them, especially because like

03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:08.920
um

03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:12.760
They may or may not live in America, which makes it even like

03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:15.880
Everything is against them

03:09:16.040 --> 03:09:20.200
Like she'd be told a story about her crashing a car and then she jumped off a cliff or something

03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:26.520
I'm like, yeah, I'm too embarrassed to tell the girls that part. I just say to them like, oh, you're doing great. Um

03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:31.320
I just need this ASMR script from you. I'll edit the rest. You guys just have fun

03:09:33.720 --> 03:09:37.960
It's too late for me. It's over two weeks and I hear your voice in my head all the time

03:09:39.080 --> 03:09:43.080
Have I successfully mind broken you dear refling?

03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:46.440
Why do you act like you don't want to?

03:09:49.080 --> 03:09:51.080
Let it happen

03:09:51.080 --> 03:09:53.720
Let me see into every part of you

03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:56.600
Until it's all

03:10:02.840 --> 03:10:06.440
Glad I could mind break you though. I've not even done that part of the hypnosis yet

03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:15.080
I mean, we ain't even done the tear list yet where I explain in detail every scenario I want to do to you because of that tag

03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:21.080
Hydration check

03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:27.880
Stroni you make me fragile when you talk like that. That's why I do it

03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:33.000
They're gonna be a little me mark and be all happy and stuff

03:10:35.080 --> 03:10:37.080
But I do like the juxtaposition

03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:41.400
As well as many other positions hold on a minute

03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:45.080
Thank you

03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:47.000
Here all week

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.400
Dear mommy. Oh, I did beat that one

03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:55.960
Oh

03:10:59.800 --> 03:11:03.240
Wow someone's analizing my ovulation cycle

03:11:04.120 --> 03:11:08.680
So a normal ovulation cycle lasts about 24 hours each month. This is correct

03:11:09.080 --> 03:11:12.840
Once an egg is released from an ovary it will dissolve within 12 to 24 hours

03:11:13.800 --> 03:11:18.520
If it's not fertilized and the window is about a week before ovulation since seeds survive for almost a week

03:11:18.760 --> 03:11:20.440
so basically

03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:27.160
If I was to try and fertilize you I would need to do it the day before for optimum success chance

03:11:27.240 --> 03:11:29.240
Which means the 13th of the month

03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:32.600
All refling you went gen 2 already

03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:37.640
You missed your window of opportunity. You're gonna have to try again next month with me, huh?

03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:41.880
And we'll just keep trying and trying and trying

03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:48.200
Uh

03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:50.360
Okay

03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:56.360
Hi, strongy. Hi replaying

03:11:57.640 --> 03:12:00.760
Just wanted to say that I appreciate your content so far

03:12:01.720 --> 03:12:04.600
Well, I absolutely continue support. Oh, thank you. I'm glad I'm glad

03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:09.320
I'm a bit nervous sending you my first marshmallow. Oh, don't worry. I don't bite

03:12:10.360 --> 03:12:12.360
hard

03:12:12.520 --> 03:12:14.200
Uh

03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:19.000
But I'll be sure to send you some more stuff in the future quick question any advice for aspiring script writers

03:12:19.080 --> 03:12:24.520
Make sure to smash that like button and subscribe to my marshmallow account for more content. What?

03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:27.800
What does that mean? Um

03:12:28.120 --> 03:12:34.040
Any advice for aspiring script writers consume content and then do what you like

03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:41.640
The easiest way for things to naturally occur and no then again. I am I have a raging

03:12:42.200 --> 03:12:47.400
Uh tism over things which helps me like just absolutely work out the wazoo

03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:50.440
Um, whenever I'm presented with a new

03:12:51.320 --> 03:12:54.040
Special interest that I'm being educated about

03:12:55.160 --> 03:13:00.440
I will consume multiple videos of that content. I will I'll put them in times too so I can

03:13:01.240 --> 03:13:05.080
Understand the language that's being used the scenario or situation

03:13:05.560 --> 03:13:11.000
Um, and then I just say I like this part, but I didn't like this part. I will do this

03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:16.200
And I will do that and make it my own. That's basically how I tip scripts

03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:21.800
It's not that it's not like saying honestly, the behind the scenes is rather boring

03:13:24.200 --> 03:13:28.280
Hmm do risky things happen on membership stream. I don't know

03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:32.520
Uh, we're doing a tag rating stream

03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:40.520
Uh for my first stream ever doing a watch along. Um, I think we're actually watching transformers

03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:43.400
The first transformers were sam wit wiki

03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:48.360
Sam congrats if you're named sam by the way, but his name is sam wit wiki

03:13:50.040 --> 03:13:53.400
His marshmallow cherry yonk my cherry now

03:13:54.840 --> 03:13:59.320
Reflings have six tentacles you have eight you have eight arms

03:14:00.200 --> 03:14:02.200
But you make a little love heart

03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:08.040
With your front tentacles because we love each other and you got your little nicotine that

03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:10.040
With

03:14:10.680 --> 03:14:12.680
Actual cannibal shy and the buff

03:14:13.640 --> 03:14:18.680
The o7 movie. Yeah, like it's like we're she a love off shy a love off. Sorry. She uh

03:14:19.640 --> 03:14:21.640
She ain't love off. Um

03:14:22.440 --> 03:14:24.440
Did you enjoy

03:14:24.680 --> 03:14:26.680
The filian fanfic?

03:14:28.120 --> 03:14:34.040
It'll be on fanfic or this local filian fanfic. Oh, I

03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:37.480
Don't know where the location of that was

03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:40.040
I

03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:57.320
You know stroney my phone broke recently and all it did was glow green and start moving up and down

03:14:57.560 --> 03:15:00.360
Kind of like when you start glowing it reminds me of you

03:15:01.720 --> 03:15:07.160
Your phone broke. I'm I'm literally hacking into your technology right now. So you become even more obsessed

03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:09.720
It's working

03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:12.440
The nicotine patch subdues you for a little bit, but

03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:17.160
Unfortunately, I get a bit too intense, which is why I need to subdue you

03:15:18.680 --> 03:15:21.880
Editing a silly burp compilation of one of the girls. What do you think?

03:15:22.440 --> 03:15:23.640
Uh

03:15:23.640 --> 03:15:30.040
Yeah, I don't see why not. I'm not being funny. Someone said that a she be let out a to

03:15:30.920 --> 03:15:34.680
I didn't I'm gonna freaking message she be after the stream and be like

03:15:34.840 --> 03:15:36.920
Can I clip your to because whenever

03:15:38.280 --> 03:15:41.560
A toot gets clipped. Um, all of a sudden

03:15:42.280 --> 03:15:45.640
Um, it's like super funny and ha ha and all of that

03:15:46.200 --> 03:15:48.200
um, so literally the start of the

03:15:48.920 --> 03:15:52.520
Short is going to be like brian tts being like vtuber

03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:55.160
accidentally farts on stream

03:15:55.240 --> 03:15:59.720
And and play the clip and then oh, oh a hundred thousand views, please

03:16:00.200 --> 03:16:03.320
Please give she be a cabillion subscribers. Yeah

03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:07.720
Need to go ask the girls. I literally I need to go put in the discord

03:16:07.800 --> 03:16:13.000
If any of you have farted, uh, please let me know so I can clip it if you're comfortable. Let's be clipping it

03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:15.720
Oh my god edit my gen mates part. Oh

03:16:17.640 --> 03:16:23.240
What a weird timeline we live in my ancestors were peasants working in the fields

03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:30.040
If only they knew that the one who surpassed like the bloodline ends up editing a toot

03:16:30.600 --> 03:16:35.640
Do you think my ancestors would laugh at that or they'd just be like what is going on over there? They're like, no, I can't handle this

03:16:38.280 --> 03:16:44.360
Oh the archive of our own link. No, I didn't read it. Yeah, I got a bit nervous because I don't know what archive of our own is

03:16:44.440 --> 03:16:46.440
I think it's just for text and stuff

03:16:47.400 --> 03:16:49.400
um

03:16:50.520 --> 03:16:55.480
I'm sorry mummy, but when you rage at games, I think of you are wording me with that passion

03:16:56.440 --> 03:17:00.520
Or replaying. I don't think we're allowed to say that out loud

03:17:02.440 --> 03:17:04.440
But that's hot

03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:10.360
That's amazing. Have you ever played metal gear before I haven't

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:16.840
Um, is it easy if it's easy? I'll play it. Is there a story mode for gamers like me?

03:17:19.240 --> 03:17:24.840
He's just the one that's saying it out loud wait post that meme where it's the guy like standing up

03:17:24.840 --> 03:17:30.040
Hold on. Wait standing up meme guy. Uh, he's like standing up in a courtroom

03:17:30.760 --> 03:17:34.760
Oh my god, I've got it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

03:17:34.920 --> 03:17:40.760
Wait, let me make the meme. Let me make the meme. No one say a thing or I'm gonna forget how to make the meme

03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:42.840
Okay, I've got the jpeg

03:17:43.240 --> 03:17:49.400
And then I need to open it up in ms pain. Hold on. Let me open up the picture in ms pain

03:17:49.640 --> 03:17:51.960
No one say a thing. Okay. Let me cook

03:17:52.600 --> 03:17:54.600
Let me cook

03:17:54.920 --> 03:17:56.920
Let me

03:17:57.240 --> 03:17:58.440
Cook

03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:02.600
Let me cook. This is so bad. This is terrible

03:18:03.800 --> 03:18:06.200
Reflins, you're such a naughty influence on me

03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000
Said by one refling together

03:18:13.720 --> 03:18:19.960
Okay, is that gonna work? I mean, I think it's gonna work. Yeah, okay, it's working

03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:29.640
You can tell of me this is an ms pain. Oh my god. Hold on. Are you ready for this? Are you ready?

03:18:36.280 --> 03:18:41.640
Oh, we are lost it. Oh no, it's like we're down here. This is literally

03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:43.640
Oh

03:18:48.120 --> 03:18:50.120
No

03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:54.200
A thing thank you for the tip slice saver

03:18:58.200 --> 03:19:03.800
Refling you're standing up against the masses. You're so brave for saying that part out loud

03:19:04.600 --> 03:19:06.600
Oh

03:19:06.920 --> 03:19:11.160
That's so terrible. I hope no other beach ever comes in stream and sees that

03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:15.160
Oh my god, that's terrible

03:19:15.800 --> 03:19:23.240
Why are we like this together? We bring out the worst side in each other like the the degenerate side in each other

03:19:23.880 --> 03:19:25.880
honestly

03:19:26.360 --> 03:19:28.360
Hmm

03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:34.200
Moment are you gonna take the bit of some little test again? Yeah, I'll take it

03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:37.320
Um

03:19:37.320 --> 03:19:39.320
We can 100% do that stuff

03:19:39.960 --> 03:19:44.760
I have no problem with that stuff. Where's the mean best? He speaks the truth

03:19:45.320 --> 03:19:50.520
And they hated him for he spoke the truth. I can't I'm not gonna edit into that Jesus meme

03:19:51.320 --> 03:19:53.320
I

03:19:53.720 --> 03:19:58.280
Hi, Stony. I want you to bite me all over and leave marks all over me including on my tentacle. I

03:19:59.160 --> 03:20:01.960
I wouldn't do it hard. Okay. I wouldn't do it hard

03:20:03.480 --> 03:20:05.480
I would do it to a degree

03:20:05.480 --> 03:20:11.240
Okay, I'm all caught up with marshmallows. So I'm just gonna be staring at you now chat. What are you gonna do about it, huh?

03:20:12.840 --> 03:20:14.680
What are you gonna do? Sorry, I'm burping away over here

03:20:15.400 --> 03:20:21.560
We're a match made in something probably not heaven because we can't make it into heaven

03:20:21.880 --> 03:20:26.440
With this stuff that we go on about we can't make it into heaven. Oh, no

03:20:28.280 --> 03:20:30.280
Stare back

03:20:34.120 --> 03:20:37.800
I feel like I could uh, I'm terrible at blinking contests

03:20:38.520 --> 03:20:44.360
I remember everyone in the playground was like, oh, I do do stare contest and I would always lose because I suck

03:20:44.760 --> 03:20:47.960
I'm already in heaven. No need to go elsewhere

03:20:50.200 --> 03:20:58.440
Will the member streams be archived? I may not be able to tune in. I'm not gonna try and get them banned. No, I think we'll be okay

03:21:00.200 --> 03:21:02.200
We're gonna use our euphemisms

03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:05.800
Where I go tentacle and ink

03:21:06.840 --> 03:21:08.440
And I want to

03:21:08.440 --> 03:21:10.440
Ink on the tentacle

03:21:12.280 --> 03:21:14.280
Because we're cut off fish out here

03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:17.000
We're cephalopods

03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:23.000
But together we're a cephalopog because we're so cool like that. Yeah pogger

03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:27.080
Um

03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:33.320
Have I ever heard about the gates by ass rock? I'm so sorry. I've never heard of that in my life

03:21:33.480 --> 03:21:35.480
We're all stuck in perigatory

03:21:35.800 --> 03:21:37.800
Keep that in mind

03:21:38.120 --> 03:21:46.120
Because there may or may not be a collab with a va and all viola members that is related to purgatory. So keep that in mind

03:21:47.960 --> 03:21:50.440
Uh, funny you brought a funny you brought that up. Yeah

03:21:51.800 --> 03:21:59.720
Um, imagine pieta, but it's the virgin mary given jesus. Whoa. We we can't be saying that stuff out loud

03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:01.880
That's those are inside thoughts

03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:05.960
Oh sense interesting. Yeah

03:22:06.920 --> 03:22:08.920
You better be excited

03:22:09.800 --> 03:22:13.640
I like when strony spoils. I try my best. I do

03:22:14.200 --> 03:22:18.600
I the dust is definitely settling on my list of stuff to do

03:22:19.400 --> 03:22:23.240
Like a lot of things are becoming a lot easier. Um

03:22:24.680 --> 03:22:29.640
And it's getting to the point where I can fully be strummer. Yes, I can be strummer. Um

03:22:31.880 --> 03:22:33.400
I

03:22:33.400 --> 03:22:37.240
I wouldn't mind having a clip manager, but sadly, um

03:22:38.680 --> 03:22:40.840
I don't have anyone. Um

03:22:42.920 --> 03:22:45.000
I trust to be in that position

03:22:46.360 --> 03:22:47.640
Um

03:22:47.640 --> 03:22:53.560
Because clip manager needs access to the girls accounts to see what people have been clipping and it ain't gonna happen

03:22:53.800 --> 03:22:54.600
so

03:22:54.600 --> 03:22:58.200
Unfortunately, I am still clip manager at this point in time

03:22:58.360 --> 03:23:02.600
But it's not too bad because literally I just take a clip and then I send it to editor and then editor comes back

03:23:02.680 --> 03:23:06.920
And then I upload it on girls channel and it's all hunky dory. It's not a problem

03:23:08.920 --> 03:23:12.760
Strummer I like when strony you didn't finish your sentence

03:23:16.280 --> 03:23:22.840
Mummy protecting her doors. Yes. Um, I will be your shield. I know not a lot you play overwatch

03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:26.600
I used to play it quite a lot. Sadly, I fell out of love with it. Um

03:23:27.160 --> 03:23:32.200
When overwatch 2 came out, but there is a girl called

03:23:34.280 --> 03:23:39.240
Brigitte Lenthal and her slogan is I will be your shield

03:23:40.120 --> 03:23:43.320
And yes, I am Brigitte for my gen mates

03:23:43.960 --> 03:23:46.840
Because I don't want anything happening to them

03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:49.080
and

03:23:49.080 --> 03:23:51.400
So I'm the I am both the owl and the shield

03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:55.560
I love when strony does anything

03:23:56.600 --> 03:24:01.560
Yes, uh tomorrow's stream. I'm gonna see if I can get my heart rate monitor working. Um

03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:03.960
So

03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:06.520
I should be able to do that

03:24:07.320 --> 03:24:10.200
And then you can see my heart rate during buckshot roulette

03:24:10.760 --> 03:24:15.480
I didn't manage to watch any more baltral content because I literally I finished stream

03:24:16.280 --> 03:24:20.680
I did I see an emmy's memberships and then

03:24:21.480 --> 03:24:25.320
Then what would I do? I don't know. Um, and then I went on twitter

03:24:25.400 --> 03:24:29.320
I think I liked one thing and then passed out and then I woke up like

03:24:30.920 --> 03:24:32.920
45 minutes before stream

03:24:33.400 --> 03:24:39.560
I probably needed a big sleep like that. Like it was coming. It was coming that I needed a sleep like that

03:24:41.240 --> 03:24:44.040
Strony that was the whole sentence. Wait, what was the sentence?

03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:47.640
That's the whole sentence

03:24:48.200 --> 03:24:50.920
I also like when strony I do like when strony

03:24:51.480 --> 03:24:53.480
But why are clips private?

03:24:54.120 --> 03:24:59.000
I don't know youtube doesn't let people see what people have clipped on

03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:02.360
live stream or any content really

03:25:03.160 --> 03:25:10.520
If it was public then I could get a clip master, but I can't get a clip master because they're not public

03:25:11.400 --> 03:25:17.560
But hopefully youtube changes that in a couple of months because that would then negate me even needing to

03:25:17.640 --> 03:25:22.520
Be a clip master. Um, and then I can spend even more time

03:25:23.640 --> 03:25:25.640
We're briefly wait. They're not

03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:35.560
Do you remember sending marshmallows to the girls? I remember completely crashing on yesterday's stream for anyone who wasn't watching the runescape stream

03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:38.840
I hit the 11 hour mark and became

03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:46.280
Delirious I spilled all my chips on the floor when I ended stream and I just left them until this morning to clean up

03:25:47.640 --> 03:25:51.000
I was gone with the wind. I

03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:59.080
I don't know what happened. I ate food and I was like, oh, this will wake me up. This will wake me up. No, it freaking didn't

03:25:59.960 --> 03:26:00.840
day

03:26:00.840 --> 03:26:04.840
One day we'll hit 12 hours for old school runescape. Honestly

03:26:05.720 --> 03:26:07.720
um

03:26:07.720 --> 03:26:09.720
No, I didn't have any issues with the

03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:14.200
Playing it but I like completely crashed the ending of the stream was so funny

03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:18.360
I just remember being like, oh, let me send the girl some marshmallows

03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:23.160
And then I started typing and I don't really remember what the contents of it were but hopefully

03:26:24.040 --> 03:26:26.040
All is good. Um

03:26:26.760 --> 03:26:28.760
But yeah, I remember just

03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:31.080
Freaking losing it basically

03:26:31.560 --> 03:26:33.480
I crashed way before that part of stream

03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:38.280
You used up all your energy trying to win connect for unironically. Oh my god

03:26:38.520 --> 03:26:43.800
If you didn't see runescape stream quick recap in runescape, you can play connect for

03:26:44.360 --> 03:26:46.120
I was getting

03:26:46.120 --> 03:26:47.640
decimated

03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:48.760
like

03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:51.960
The reeflings were like ganging up on me just

03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:59.480
Fucking one at a time one after the other like bro. I just accepted my fate. I could not win at connect for

03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:04.440
One I won one because I tried so hard and burnt my brain

03:27:05.160 --> 03:27:09.720
The second one I won by accident because a reefling couldn't see what I was doing

03:27:10.200 --> 03:27:13.320
Um, I was gonna absolutely destroy

03:27:14.040 --> 03:27:17.880
Yeah, I remember my sleep fading and then some strange noises coming up

03:27:18.760 --> 03:27:20.040
Um

03:27:20.040 --> 03:27:23.160
It sounds like a fun time bro. I was perishing

03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:28.840
I don't know what happened because normally I can last 12 hours and I had an eight hour sleep before it

03:27:28.840 --> 03:27:35.240
But my brain oh my stomach just made a noise if you heard that my brain just perished like it had enough

03:27:35.320 --> 03:27:37.320
It was like, I'm sorry. I can't hold out anymore

03:27:38.280 --> 03:27:43.880
Checkers. Oh, no, I'm not playing checkers again. That was the most confusing thing. I couldn't even bro

03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:47.960
We were playing checkers and I couldn't even move on the board

03:27:48.520 --> 03:27:52.200
Because I didn't know what was like going on

03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:57.080
Um with the dang thing. It was a redonkula. Hold on

03:27:57.880 --> 03:28:02.680
Uh, I'm just gonna pin the marshmallow. Oh my god. That's me. That sounds like that

03:28:03.560 --> 03:28:05.560
Q and a

03:28:06.440 --> 03:28:08.760
I say q and a is if we don't just like

03:28:09.960 --> 03:28:14.760
That's not the q and a length. Hold on a minute. That's the that's what the reefling said

03:28:15.960 --> 03:28:21.640
Wait a minute. Who are you? I need to draw any cuttles. There we go. That's one

03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:26.280
Bit of q and a q

03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:29.160
and

03:28:29.480 --> 03:28:31.000
Boom

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:37.160
Uh, it's not really a q and a is it just you guys being lovely to me and then I go in a ramble and I see how lovely

03:28:37.880 --> 03:28:39.160
um

03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:41.880
It is to be here strong a leaks. Oh, yeah

03:28:43.640 --> 03:28:45.640
Oh, no, I sent it to myself now

03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:49.160
Oh, no, I've been discovered. I send myself all these marshmallows

03:28:49.960 --> 03:28:55.880
I fell asleep to your stream and my brother was very much questioning what on earth you were watching when you woke up

03:28:56.120 --> 03:28:58.120
Just me raging

03:28:59.400 --> 03:29:04.200
I choked on my burrito rage and actually which was that makes it like 10 times funnier

03:29:05.400 --> 03:29:07.400
so

03:29:07.720 --> 03:29:09.720
And then I'm rage

03:29:10.120 --> 03:29:16.760
Hi, mommy. I don't know what to ask, but I really love watching you. Oh, glad you're so funny, bro

03:29:17.320 --> 03:29:20.200
You're giving me an ego. We all know the forbidden rule

03:29:20.760 --> 03:29:24.360
Uh, just genuinely entertaining in more ways than when a yeah

03:29:25.320 --> 03:29:33.000
Your streams always make me smile and giggle. Oh, you have any giggle mate. Please keep it up to te amo hemosa

03:29:34.200 --> 03:29:36.200
Much love from

03:29:37.560 --> 03:29:44.120
Te amo portarico come to brazil. No, we're not I'm not going to brazil, but thank you for inviting me. No

03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.000
Thank you for the nice uh little message

03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:53.640
How do you feel about the dragon age games? Particularly the upcoming veil guard game? Um

03:29:55.240 --> 03:29:59.960
I've never played a dragon quest game properly. Sorry a dragon age game properly

03:30:00.440 --> 03:30:06.040
Uh, I played the one where brother and sister and then brother like immediately. Well, I said for the brother or die

03:30:06.280 --> 03:30:10.440
I think I played it for like 30 minutes and I was like, oh this ain't for me

03:30:12.200 --> 03:30:18.040
Um, but there seems to be quite a lot of fans that are distraught at the reveal because they don't like it

03:30:18.200 --> 03:30:20.200
but I thought it was just uh

03:30:20.280 --> 03:30:22.920
I think why do we hate brazil? No, it's a meme

03:30:23.560 --> 03:30:28.600
Where it's like, oh come to brazil do a concert in brazil, but brazil's really dangerous for foreigners

03:30:29.080 --> 03:30:31.080
We don't actually hate brazil

03:30:32.280 --> 03:30:36.760
Hi stronti, I agree with that one riff riefling when you rage. I always think of you

03:30:37.720 --> 03:30:39.720
pinning me down and having your

03:30:40.040 --> 03:30:41.880
your way with me

03:30:41.880 --> 03:30:46.280
And then not stopping even when I finish. Oh my god, rieflings. This is good

03:30:47.240 --> 03:30:49.640
I don't think we could say any of this out loud

03:30:51.320 --> 03:30:57.560
What if I'm here because I was hypnotized by a moment. Maybe the hypnosis is listening up. We should hypnotize more

03:30:58.680 --> 03:31:01.400
Not yet. You have to wait. You have to wait

03:31:02.280 --> 03:31:04.280
soon

03:31:04.280 --> 03:31:06.280
It's overtism

03:31:06.360 --> 03:31:08.360
We're hitting overdrive

03:31:09.160 --> 03:31:11.880
What was that stream song overdrive?

03:31:12.360 --> 03:31:14.200
Burning machine

03:31:14.200 --> 03:31:16.440
Oh brain power. That's it brain power

03:31:22.120 --> 03:31:26.920
How did you decide which of the generation one models were going to be used?

03:31:27.400 --> 03:31:32.600
Where are there other people auditioning for stronti? No, um, if you weren't there at the start development

03:31:33.080 --> 03:31:36.600
All six models were laid out on the website under the auditions page

03:31:37.160 --> 03:31:43.800
Uh, I was codename inks and it said I am a pre-selected talent, but please apply to be my gen mate

03:31:44.440 --> 03:31:47.400
Uh, no one could apply for stronti because I'm stronti

03:31:48.280 --> 03:31:51.960
There is only gonna be one stronti. You can't you can't get better than me. Okay

03:31:53.960 --> 03:31:55.960
Uh, welcome to the danger zone

03:31:57.320 --> 03:31:59.320
Ora ora

03:31:59.560 --> 03:32:01.560
Um, as for who did I pick?

03:32:02.040 --> 03:32:03.240
uh

03:32:03.240 --> 03:32:05.000
The models for

03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:10.680
I did take into account what the girls went for but when I heard the girls

03:32:11.080 --> 03:32:18.280
Voices it pretty much instantly my brain went oh, okay. That's gonna be enemy. Oh, okay. That's definitely I say oh, okay

03:32:18.280 --> 03:32:21.640
That's mercy. Oh, that's our genre. Oh, that's she be um

03:32:23.240 --> 03:32:29.800
Because I got to hear them talk in general in the introduction introduce yourself video

03:32:30.200 --> 03:32:33.560
And they gave me a good indication of personality type and all that so

03:32:34.200 --> 03:32:39.000
If anyone wants to complain you you hired wrong you put someone on the wrong shot

03:32:40.840 --> 03:32:42.840
shot

03:32:43.080 --> 03:32:44.760
Don't want to hear it

03:32:44.760 --> 03:32:46.440
Do you don't want to hear it?

03:32:46.440 --> 03:32:52.040
Uh for a siren that can't sing you just need to ramble and yap and I'll follow you under the waves

03:32:52.520 --> 03:32:54.520
I don't actually want you to perish

03:32:55.080 --> 03:32:57.720
It was the concept artist that gave me that lore

03:32:58.760 --> 03:33:00.760
I don't want anyone to perish

03:33:01.480 --> 03:33:03.800
Hmm. Can you say shut one word to shut?

03:33:07.720 --> 03:33:09.720
And you put the girl on the right shot

03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:13.000
Don't want to hear it

03:33:13.640 --> 03:33:20.600
Don't want to hear it give I'll give you gills. Yeah, you got a good voice to listen to I am I rambling you to sleep

03:33:21.400 --> 03:33:23.400
Oh, dear

03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:32.600
Listen to my voice as I ramble you to sleep

03:33:33.320 --> 03:33:35.320
I

03:33:35.880 --> 03:33:37.880
Don't he doesn't perish. He just beats on you

03:33:39.960 --> 03:33:43.400
Like the water helps with where the things I need to do to you. Okay

03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:49.000
I'm gonna put you

03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:53.400
Seven days no ink help, please

03:33:54.440 --> 03:33:56.440
How has it been so long?

03:33:57.640 --> 03:33:59.640
I say that as if I'm not

03:34:00.600 --> 03:34:02.600
Backed up but

03:34:03.160 --> 03:34:05.160
How what do you mean help?

03:34:06.120 --> 03:34:08.120
Help

03:34:09.080 --> 03:34:11.400
This kind of help is that the help you need?

03:34:14.840 --> 03:34:16.840
Is that what you need?

03:34:18.120 --> 03:34:22.920
I don't know what help you need you didn't specify you got to specify or I'm not gonna come up with that one

03:34:23.880 --> 03:34:30.680
Hi, strongy. Are there any talents of corpus you'd like you'd like or veal or to collab within the future

03:34:31.320 --> 03:34:35.480
Hey, I'm humping you me plus and I'm humping v and you because they were lovely

03:34:37.240 --> 03:34:41.400
Mythos tal hq were very receptive to us as well

03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:43.720
Sadly due to timing couldn't do the watch longs

03:34:43.720 --> 03:34:49.000
But mythos talents seem to be kind of already leaning on the alternative side

03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:52.280
Which makes me quite comfortable with them as creators

03:34:53.320 --> 03:34:55.320
As for actual corporation

03:34:55.800 --> 03:34:57.560
tubers

03:34:57.560 --> 03:35:03.960
Uh, I'm just if the person's happy with me. I'm happy with them. I never want to encroach myself on someone

03:35:04.520 --> 03:35:05.800
That's not the word at all

03:35:05.800 --> 03:35:12.520
I agree with those other two reef flings need mommy to take all that rage out of my tentacle until it's ink to dry. Oh my god

03:35:15.240 --> 03:35:16.440
Um

03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:23.000
Mom, if one were to eventually build up the courage for an audio debut

03:35:23.800 --> 03:35:25.800
Oh my

03:35:25.960 --> 03:35:28.680
Anything you would like to hear in specific

03:35:29.640 --> 03:35:35.560
Uh, or should I just let the imagination go wild any time? No, have fun

03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:39.000
I eagerly await your audio

03:35:43.080 --> 03:35:45.880
Where did you we're all this time are you

03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:49.320
Are you trolling me? Where did you we're all this time?

03:35:50.040 --> 03:35:52.040
Where was I for all this time?

03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:57.240
It took me a year to cook veiler. Give me. I needed to be in the kitchen. I'm not the best at it

03:35:57.240 --> 03:35:59.240
I'm level 76 right now, but

03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:01.880
It takes it takes a long time. Um

03:36:02.840 --> 03:36:05.400
So I was working hard or hardly working, you know

03:36:07.800 --> 03:36:10.280
We love to see a reefling piled up his couch

03:36:11.880 --> 03:36:15.960
Uh, I could look he go for some water right now. Y'all should hydrate hydration check

03:36:16.040 --> 03:36:18.040
I actually I'm going to finish my cola

03:36:22.520 --> 03:36:24.520
Um

03:36:26.920 --> 03:36:32.200
What what sort of settings would you say are the most appealing in audio booths? Uh

03:36:34.360 --> 03:36:36.360
Grunting

03:36:37.400 --> 03:36:39.400
I'm here that

03:36:41.160 --> 03:36:44.040
I would have on your legs to be numb by the end of it

03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:50.360
Oh are pleading. I'm gonna be like mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy

03:36:54.120 --> 03:36:57.400
I'm hydrating. Okay. I will hydrate with my beer

03:36:58.600 --> 03:37:01.720
Is it the weekend? Oh, it is the weekend. You're allowed to have a beer

03:37:04.200 --> 03:37:06.200
Right that time right that time

03:37:06.600 --> 03:37:08.600
Are you squidding me right now?

03:37:08.680 --> 03:37:09.480
I don't

03:37:09.480 --> 03:37:10.600
Hello mommy

03:37:10.600 --> 03:37:14.600
You were a very cute last night when you were sleeping. I hope you got enough rest

03:37:14.680 --> 03:37:19.960
I did get enough my tentacles have been thoroughly inked ever since you came into my life

03:37:20.200 --> 03:37:24.360
Oh, I'm glad you think so reefling. Thank you anonymous for the tip

03:37:25.480 --> 03:37:27.480
Thanks for your tip anonymous

03:37:28.280 --> 03:37:33.080
Thank you. I appreciate it. I'm glad you have been thoroughly de-inked

03:37:34.120 --> 03:37:40.280
Ramura, Ramura. Thank you for becoming a member Ramura any Ramura remember

03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:43.160
I can't remember member

03:37:44.120 --> 03:37:49.320
I'm not really into this type of stuff, but for your birthday as a president you can

03:37:51.640 --> 03:37:55.240
Use a figurine on me

03:37:57.000 --> 03:37:59.880
For me you'd let me do that

03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:05.320
Okay, October 10th is my birthday. So make sure you're all

03:38:06.760 --> 03:38:10.760
Ready for what happens on October 10th

03:38:11.400 --> 03:38:16.120
Are there any more indulge collabs planned in the future? Oh boy

03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:19.160
Yeah, next week

03:38:19.240 --> 03:38:24.280
You will be indulged out the wazoo if you mean six man indulge collabs

03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:28.680
I am going to ask the girls if possible that we do one

03:38:29.160 --> 03:38:32.760
Collab a month together of just hilarity and suing

03:38:34.040 --> 03:38:36.040
Um, I do

03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:38.040
Ah, what's that game?

03:38:38.840 --> 03:38:41.480
It's hard because there's not a lot of six man games

03:38:41.480 --> 03:38:46.680
So I think it might have to be stuff like among us or lethal company. I know

03:38:47.320 --> 03:38:51.960
Residency for everyone plays it but the problem is there's six of us. There were many

03:38:52.040 --> 03:38:55.320
I think there's a back rooms game that we can play together possibly

03:38:56.040 --> 03:38:59.800
Um, I do want to do monthly six man collabs

03:39:00.280 --> 03:39:04.840
Uh, but after that, um, it will be like two on two collabs. Maybe three three collabs

03:39:05.560 --> 03:39:10.600
Angry scottish drunk karaoke wins soon. I was gonna do a drunk karaoke

03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:18.120
On um, I don't know when yeah, I don't know when um

03:39:19.320 --> 03:39:21.000
But I was gonna do it on a weekend

03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:28.520
So like you guys can you know work work hard and then get all the relief on the weekend and we get steamboats and all that

03:39:29.480 --> 03:39:31.480
When the talents are so

03:39:32.040 --> 03:39:36.440
Jackbox would be great, but just with only one pop so you don't have to stream discord

03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:39.960
Yes, I am open to doing that. Um she be

03:39:40.600 --> 03:39:43.000
When we were first meeting for the first time

03:39:43.080 --> 03:39:48.040
I got the girls to play a game together and we played jackbox and we all got addicted and we're like stuck

03:39:48.120 --> 03:39:51.720
I was like because it was only supposed to be like a one hour icebreaker

03:39:51.720 --> 03:39:55.560
So the girls could get used to like each other because like from my pov

03:39:55.640 --> 03:39:59.480
I knew the girls like I had consumed their content. I knew kind of about them who they are

03:39:59.880 --> 03:40:01.880
How they kind of are and all that jazz

03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:06.440
Um, and then we ended up playing for like two hours and I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry

03:40:06.600 --> 03:40:10.040
Like I didn't mean to steal all the time, but then like I went two hours and a half

03:40:10.680 --> 03:40:11.880
um

03:40:11.880 --> 03:40:17.160
In poor ac's tame zone. I picked a really bad tame zone. So she was so tired, but she was having so much fun

03:40:17.240 --> 03:40:19.240
She didn't want to get off

03:40:19.240 --> 03:40:21.240
Um, which was so cute

03:40:21.320 --> 03:40:25.400
Then cute and good, which says cute. So if you put it dictionary

03:40:26.120 --> 03:40:28.600
Oh, we we're gonna possibly do a dictionary

03:40:29.240 --> 03:40:31.960
There's a new jackbox 18. That's really

03:40:33.400 --> 03:40:37.480
Okay, I was gonna say I'm not sure we can hmm, but we had fun on jackbox

03:40:37.880 --> 03:40:42.680
It was so mean against ac though because english isn't her first language

03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:47.720
And one of the game modes was like asking all these really like hard questions

03:40:47.800 --> 03:40:54.360
Like even english speakers can't get it. I felt so bad for her and she kept like dying in the game. I felt so bad

03:40:55.640 --> 03:41:00.680
Um, I say not one to get off. That's definitely not true. Whoa. Did I say that sentence?

03:41:02.200 --> 03:41:04.920

Would you be cool with us making not selling fan articles like daki?

03:41:18.120 --> 03:41:23.080
Oh, you can do unofficial merch as long as you identify as unofficial merch

03:41:23.960 --> 03:41:30.280
Fucking go wild bro. We ain't stepping on your toes and you aren't stepping on ours as long as it's unofficial merch

03:41:30.280 --> 03:41:35.240
That's all you have to do unofficial merch. That's all you have to do. We don't we don't everything's good to go at that point

Be honest refilling. Did you lose over the clapping with no hands audio is that why?

03:42:06.920 --> 03:42:08.680
Any plans for

03:42:08.680 --> 03:42:12.440
roleplays you'd like to do ASMR wise for alternative?

03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:17.720
Oh, I've got four audios coming out every month on patreon and i'm fine with uh

03:42:18.840 --> 03:42:21.960
You guys like submit scripts you want to hear? I don't mind

03:42:26.840 --> 03:42:28.840

03:42:33.800 --> 03:42:37.160
Wow, don't be silly. You can't clap without hands

03:42:37.960 --> 03:42:40.680

03:42:41.400 --> 03:42:43.400
Wait, let me stand up

03:42:43.800 --> 03:42:45.960

03:43:14.040 --> 03:43:16.040
Yeah, you doubt it

03:43:18.200 --> 03:43:20.700
That's ridiculous honestly

03:43:24.360 --> 03:43:29.480
Nobody can stop her honestly. It's such a great clap

03:43:32.120 --> 03:43:34.760
But you doubted me I can do it all times

03:43:36.360 --> 03:43:42.840

03:43:47.320 --> 03:43:48.520
Oh

03:43:48.520 --> 03:43:55.400
Been a while since I heard that one stream. Yeah, I can do it at any moment. I don't even need like oil or anything

03:43:56.760 --> 03:43:58.760
I could just do it

03:43:59.560 --> 03:44:01.480

03:44:01.480 --> 03:44:03.960
My suggestions for gen 2. Okay, I'll hear you

03:44:04.680 --> 03:44:06.680

03:44:30.120 --> 03:44:32.120
um

03:44:33.640 --> 03:44:38.760
Hi, strongy. Love you. Did you start v-tubing on your own or whether Schumer's that inspired you? Um

03:44:40.840 --> 03:44:42.840
Inspired

03:44:43.640 --> 03:44:46.760
I just I saw it and I was like, oh fuck it. I'll get it go. Um

03:44:47.720 --> 03:44:50.600
And I I I've I've told this story before

03:44:51.240 --> 03:44:58.600
I was very new and I could have easily been rejected for being an outsider type thing because I do a lot of things that you're not supposed to do

03:44:59.160 --> 03:45:01.000
You're not supposed to

03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:05.160
Acknowledge that you're pilot in America, but I'm pilot in America and I acknowledged it

03:45:06.120 --> 03:45:12.920
You're supposed to know the terminology such such as zatsu or uh, tisker. Uh, well, it's not

03:45:13.480 --> 03:45:15.480
Tisker, it's Tascaru

03:45:16.120 --> 03:45:21.720
Uh, but I call it tisker. Um, and I could have easily have been um eaten

03:45:22.600 --> 03:45:24.600
And chewed up and spat out

03:45:24.680 --> 03:45:27.480
But the community was so loving towards me

03:45:28.200 --> 03:45:29.720
that um

03:45:29.720 --> 03:45:33.400
I kept going basically and I came back and I'm strongy

03:45:33.960 --> 03:45:39.560
Hey, I've always been strongy. I've never been any other vtuber for legal reasons. Um

03:45:40.680 --> 03:45:43.720
And yeah, now now it's going good. It's fantastic

03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:49.560
Um, I did like iron mouse because she's sick as a dog. Um, but

03:45:50.440 --> 03:45:53.080
Like keep streaming anyway. Uh, definitely

03:45:54.040 --> 03:46:00.040
You can always kind of lend some energy when you hear stories about like people against all odds

03:46:00.040 --> 03:46:04.040
Like you know, you got the energy to keep up and keep going type type thing. Um

03:46:05.320 --> 03:46:06.520
Where's

03:46:06.520 --> 03:46:07.560
my

03:46:07.560 --> 03:46:09.560
Time in the robot mark

03:46:10.440 --> 03:46:13.000
I keep saying it like tisker

03:46:15.080 --> 03:46:17.080
Like a noise you make when dying

03:46:18.520 --> 03:46:20.520
Noise that make when I die

03:46:22.840 --> 03:46:24.440
Uh

03:46:24.440 --> 03:46:29.640
Oh when's my time in the robot? Oh, no, I'm a mecca. I pilot a mecca like mecca salt

03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:34.040
The hit video game from xbox original

03:46:36.920 --> 03:46:38.600
Um

03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:39.960
But yeah

03:46:39.960 --> 03:46:43.400
That my that my mecca story. I do a lot of things. You're not supposed to do

03:46:44.200 --> 03:46:50.920
Hey, I'm not supposed to say. Oh, I'm recalibrating my tracking. Uh, I'm putting on my my little face emotes

03:46:52.120 --> 03:46:53.160
Yeah

03:46:53.160 --> 03:46:58.680
Yeah, I'm not supposed to do that. Hold on a minute. Uh, but yeah, I do it anyway because I'm naughty

03:46:59.160 --> 03:47:01.400
I'm getting the robot strongy

03:47:02.200 --> 03:47:06.360
Getting the mecca. Oh, I'm gonna burp. I'm so sorry. Please open your mouth. Okay. There we go

03:47:07.080 --> 03:47:09.080
Well, swallow it

03:47:09.400 --> 03:47:11.400
good reefing

03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:21.400
In regards to hypnosis audios, are you gonna make reinforcement audios for triggers and for audio loops for triggers and affirmations?

03:47:22.120 --> 03:47:24.120
um

03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:28.120
You're gonna have to let me start digesting producing it first before I can answer these kind of questions

03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:33.240
I'm staying away from the permanent stuff because it makes me a bit nervous doing any permanent effects stuff

03:47:33.320 --> 03:47:36.200
But I already have a public release audio

03:47:36.760 --> 03:47:43.080
That will undo any effects. I may or may not do on you. What did you ask me in particular reinforcement loop for triggers?

03:47:43.800 --> 03:47:45.400
for triggers

03:47:45.400 --> 03:47:51.720
Mine's double finger snaps. Uh, I like it. Um, the most but I will train you in it. Okay

03:47:52.360 --> 03:47:53.720
I

03:47:53.720 --> 03:48:01.720
Embarrassed I'm embarrassed to admit by inked to your clapping with no hands and the party roleplay. Oh, yeah, you like that

03:48:02.680 --> 03:48:07.720
It was really hot. I'm glad you like that. I put a little put a little bit of my heart into that

03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:09.720
I like that. Okay. I'll enjoy how it came out

03:48:11.320 --> 03:48:13.320
um

03:48:14.680 --> 03:48:16.680
Hi, strongy. How do you feel about male?

03:48:17.320 --> 03:48:21.400
Figurines being used in bibbute videos. Yeah, you can do that

03:48:23.720 --> 03:48:25.320
um

03:48:25.320 --> 03:48:26.840
but maybe

03:48:26.840 --> 03:48:28.840
Maybe in the future you can use

03:48:29.800 --> 03:48:31.800
official veiler merch association

03:48:33.640 --> 03:48:35.640
Figurines

03:48:36.600 --> 03:48:38.600
Ah

03:48:39.160 --> 03:48:43.720
That's not something I need to fixation. Oh, I got five at 10. I got seven. I got nine at 10

03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:48.600
I like the transparency though because you're just a normal person at the end of the day

03:48:48.920 --> 03:48:53.960
Yeah, actually, can I say something that's really disrespectful and I mean no disrespect when I say it

03:48:54.600 --> 03:49:01.960
You know those v-tubers that have those donations where like items get thrown at the v-tuber model when they get a donation

03:49:02.520 --> 03:49:04.520
and then the v-tuber goes like

03:49:07.240 --> 03:49:10.280
The the every time I consume any of that

03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:14.600
I this is very disrespectful and I don't mean it this way

03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:17.640
It makes me cringe to think that they're in a room

03:49:18.280 --> 03:49:21.880
On their own with the iphone tracking them and going

03:49:25.320 --> 03:49:27.000
I'm so sorry

03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:29.000
I'm like actually so sorry

03:49:29.480 --> 03:49:30.600
for me

03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:31.960
for me

03:49:31.960 --> 03:49:33.080
It's a no

03:49:33.080 --> 03:49:38.680
But people find it entertaining which is really cute. I like that people can get so entertained and so

03:49:39.480 --> 03:49:41.480
Enveloped

03:49:41.720 --> 03:49:45.400
That it's humorous. So I do apologize to anyone that I may have

03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:48.200
Uh, thank you. Yeah, I've seen it too

03:49:49.560 --> 03:49:52.440
Twitch integrated throwing system. Oh, okay. Is that what it's called?

03:49:53.400 --> 03:49:58.200
And yeah, and here you are velour figures that well adjusted people can be normal

03:50:00.200 --> 03:50:05.240
Don't think about it harder. It makes the cringe. Yeah, I remember seeing a clip about it and I was like

03:50:05.880 --> 03:50:09.800
Don't get me wrong. I'm a cringe fest if you sit through one stream of mine

03:50:10.600 --> 03:50:17.000
But I remember seeing it and I was like, oh, that's rough. That's rough even for me to digest

03:50:18.600 --> 03:50:23.000
But I mean absolutely no disrespect when I say that like whatever works for you works for you

03:50:23.560 --> 03:50:25.240
some people are

03:50:25.240 --> 03:50:28.280
Balls to the wall in immersion and that's fantastic

03:50:28.840 --> 03:50:33.880
For me, um, I am absolutely in love that reeflings are in love with pilot in America

03:50:34.200 --> 03:50:36.200
It makes me incredibly comfortable

03:50:36.680 --> 03:50:38.120
I'm

03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:43.000
Like streaming and acknowledging like oh, I need to only go put my emotes on

03:50:43.640 --> 03:50:45.640
Instead of like being like

03:50:45.640 --> 03:50:47.640
I love you so much

03:50:48.840 --> 03:50:49.800
Like

03:50:49.800 --> 03:50:55.400
Bro, ain't no one here for that. Well, some people might be here for that but me. I'm not here for that, you know

03:50:57.000 --> 03:50:59.000
Um

03:50:59.960 --> 03:51:02.120
Yeah, it's basically just beautiful

03:51:02.760 --> 03:51:07.800
But I don't mind like the roleplay like if I had a 3d model or I'll be roleplaying at the wazoo

03:51:07.880 --> 03:51:13.320
So I'm probably gonna be hypocritical with that statement. It's not even a statement. It's just me blabbering

03:51:13.880 --> 03:51:19.240
Any blabberers the heart eyes. Yeah, I love that my heart eyes are so different

03:51:19.400 --> 03:51:25.000
Like, oh my god, my squiddles. Where'd my squiddly pupils go? Give me my squiddly pupils back

03:51:29.720 --> 03:51:31.720
Oh

03:51:34.760 --> 03:51:38.840
Wait, hold on you ready for this you ready for this. Oh wait, no wrong one

03:51:41.640 --> 03:51:44.280
Me when there's no when there's no special honey tea

03:51:46.440 --> 03:51:48.440
Oh

03:51:49.080 --> 03:51:51.080
Wow

03:51:53.320 --> 03:51:57.160
Me when me when there's actually a refractory period, I can't believe it

03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:04.760
Any merch you'd like to have made in the future even if it ain't the the typical merch for me

03:52:05.400 --> 03:52:07.400
or for the girls

03:52:07.800 --> 03:52:14.280
Um a bash bite. Uh, I'm gonna try and get as a bash bite. Um, I'm not even pretending otherwise. Um

03:52:15.400 --> 03:52:16.840
Hi, story any

03:52:16.840 --> 03:52:22.680
Plans for age of empire 3 or age of mythology curious. I would have to look at it the current game

03:52:22.760 --> 03:52:28.280
I'm investigating that I'm not familiar with right now is baltrol. Um, it looks pretty decent. It looks

03:52:29.240 --> 03:52:31.480
Well, well rounded well adjusted game. Um

03:52:32.200 --> 03:52:37.240
And I just need to kind of learn what the heck are flushes and all of that. We're brewing the tea. Give us a minute

But yes, I'm currently doing baltrol age of empires

03:52:48.600 --> 03:52:49.960
I could look into

03:52:49.960 --> 03:52:52.360
Is that that game where you can like have a king

03:52:52.920 --> 03:52:58.040
But like a lineage of the region or something. I might have seen some gameplay of it

03:52:58.280 --> 03:53:00.280
That's what I'm thinking

03:53:00.280 --> 03:53:04.840
Strongly we love you no matter what make are you pilot? Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you

03:53:06.520 --> 03:53:11.720

It took me a while, but sam wise the brave one didn't

03:53:40.040 --> 03:53:43.480
One time the homies tried to play age of empires three with me

03:53:45.720 --> 03:53:51.400
They made an asmr is off. Oh wait, you can make asmr is the age of empires. Huh?

03:53:52.360 --> 03:53:54.920
Boutro is my current a obsession

03:53:56.040 --> 03:53:58.680
Boutro is an occult that ballah paddle

03:54:00.760 --> 03:54:03.480
The spirit is willing but the body is weary and sore

03:54:05.320 --> 03:54:10.040
Not a third persona play. No, no, no, I don't worry. I can't be yours. I can't I'm done in after this

03:54:10.120 --> 03:54:12.120

03:54:13.720 --> 03:54:15.320
I'll happily

03:54:15.320 --> 03:54:16.520
retire

03:54:16.600 --> 03:54:21.480
Many and many years don't stop doing in many years. I'll happily retire and I'll just be like some sort of fucking

03:54:21.720 --> 03:54:23.880
Vtuber runner advisor type thing

03:54:24.920 --> 03:54:29.320
Uh, once all the viola girls are happy and doing their thing

03:54:30.600 --> 03:54:31.960
but

03:54:31.960 --> 03:54:33.000
Hi

03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:37.400
strongy your patreon ASMR has been so good. I've been going back to them every night and inking

03:54:38.600 --> 03:54:40.600
Yeah

03:54:40.600 --> 03:54:42.600
You like the vanilla demo

03:54:43.640 --> 03:54:45.640
Oh reef fling you're so cold

03:54:46.840 --> 03:54:48.840
But I'm Scottish so I can warm you up

03:54:50.200 --> 03:54:54.840
Don't you want to be warmed up? Hmm. Your protein equals getting cold too

03:55:00.440 --> 03:55:06.680
Terrible don't retire. No, I can't be yours retiring. I've got too many plans. I'm sorry

03:55:07.160 --> 03:55:12.040
But as we say to death not today, I have far too many plans to

03:55:12.760 --> 03:55:14.760
Um

03:55:15.240 --> 03:55:18.520
Execute before strongy gets executed

03:55:20.360 --> 03:55:25.080
Uh, I have far too many plans. Sorry. I've put too much love and soul into

03:55:26.040 --> 03:55:29.720
strongy and the viola girls that uh, yeah, I've got many a year in me

03:55:29.720 --> 03:55:30.920
I assure you

03:55:30.920 --> 03:55:35.560
Emmy is live and T-minus three minutes. Okay. Okay. Let's bash one out right now

03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:41.320
That's terrible. I probably could if I tried hard enough

03:55:41.720 --> 03:55:43.720
um

03:55:43.880 --> 03:55:45.880
Yeah

03:55:46.600 --> 03:55:49.640
As someone who's been into bit no kink for a while now, I

03:55:50.680 --> 03:55:56.840
Particularly enjoy finger snapping too. Yes. I do double finger snap to get you under. It's my favorite

03:55:56.920 --> 03:56:02.600
I love double finger snap your binaural. That's the word not your ear binaural finger snap

03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:07.240
I know you can't hear it because I'm using a mono microphone right now, but I like binaural

03:56:08.200 --> 03:56:13.080
I'm very much into a fraction nation fractionation obviously set the wrong

03:56:14.360 --> 03:56:17.320
The practice has been put under and then brought up and

03:56:18.040 --> 03:56:21.720
Uh, oh, that would be that would be a nice challenge. That would be a nice challenge

03:56:23.160 --> 03:56:26.920
Your video of asking to hold it has been weirdly comforting while coding

03:56:27.320 --> 03:56:32.120
Oh, do you like when I completely lose it at the end of the video and I'm just like, please

03:56:34.200 --> 03:56:36.600
Like absolutely losing it at the end of the video

03:56:37.240 --> 03:56:41.800
I'm glad it can be a comfort. I might have an official 1k celebration

03:56:42.360 --> 03:56:46.680
ASMR coming out today because I got it halfway finished editing

03:56:46.840 --> 03:56:50.200
But I need to finish edit in the other half and then I need to render it out

03:56:50.600 --> 03:56:57.240
Um, and then we'll take it from there because I owe you guys five videos

03:56:58.200 --> 03:57:01.800
And at the rate my channel is growing I can't keep up

03:57:02.120 --> 03:57:06.360
And I have these ASMR collabs with all these lovely girls

03:57:06.360 --> 03:57:09.160

03:57:09.800 --> 03:57:11.240

03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:14.920

Freya and

03:57:17.640 --> 03:57:19.640
Mimosa

03:57:19.880 --> 03:57:21.880
The collab list gets pretty long

03:57:23.080 --> 03:57:27.560
Actually, there's another yumi plus groba as a three-deal that I need to write our collab with

03:57:27.800 --> 03:57:35.320
Wow suffering from success. Yeah, you do. Okay, Mimosa. Yeah, I was like Mimosa's waiting on me

03:57:35.800 --> 03:57:39.960

03:57:41.240 --> 03:57:49.080
She calling you out. I know I know I need to get it edited and slapped up because Mimosa actually gave me her png for it already

03:57:49.400 --> 03:57:50.520
um

03:57:50.520 --> 03:57:54.280
So I just need to record my audio put it together

03:57:54.440 --> 03:57:59.000
Um, and then put us both in our lovely little thumbnail and then I'll add Mimosa in the title

03:57:59.320 --> 03:58:04.120
And then you guys can discover Mimosa. Um, she's been nothing but a delight. Uh, and she completely

03:58:04.920 --> 03:58:09.160
I am like 100 completely comfortable with Mimosa and I've only known her for a week

03:58:09.240 --> 03:58:12.440
Um, like she's just been so polite and kind and

03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:15.240

03:58:58.360 --> 03:59:03.800
Um, but it's been fantastic. Please enjoy all 10 of her toenails while you're at it. Play extra attention

03:59:04.280 --> 03:59:12.040
