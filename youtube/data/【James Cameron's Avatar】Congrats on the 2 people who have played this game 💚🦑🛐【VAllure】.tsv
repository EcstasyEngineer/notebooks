0	17240	I was trying to speedrun up in the stream started and the game.
17240	23720	This game crashes so heckin' easily and it literally just crashed there.
23720	24720	Praying it works.
25720	26720	Praying it works.
26720	29720	But good morning, good evening, and good afternoon.
29720	34720	Oui, today my screen has gone black so hopefully I'm still streaming.
34720	36720	Oh my god.
36720	39720	Right, this game breaks.
39720	41720	Oh, I think it's about to break again.
41720	42720	No way.
43720	45720	Oh, this game breaks so easily.
47720	48720	Oh, don't break, don't break.
48720	50720	Oh, my screen's black again.
51720	52720	What?
53720	57720	This game breaks so easily.
57720	62720	I think this is like 2007 maybe?
62720	64720	But goodness me.
65720	67720	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
67720	72720	Oui, we are playing yet again, surprise surprise, another childhood game.
72720	73720	Wait, what?
73720	75720	Oh, it's 2009.
75720	79720	It says James Cameron's Avatar game 2009.
79720	92720	So I played this game as a little sheriff and is there a girl that's white with black hair?
92720	95720	Well, I'm not blonde.
97720	98720	I'm not.
99720	100720	Well, we just did that.
100720	102720	Right, we're blonde with green eyes today.
102720	103720	Yippee.
105720	106720	So this game.
106720	109720	Okay, now let's enter first name.
109720	110720	Squiddles.
113720	114720	Squiddly.
114720	116720	I'm feeling a bit squiddly-diddly the day about.
116720	118720	I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?
119720	121720	I had no idea they even released the game back then.
121720	126720	Oh, this game is, I wrote.
126720	132720	I'll shush until the campaign part, but they much to the campaign.
132720	134720	Let me, it got slapped together.
134720	135720	Let me tell you that much.
135720	137720	I got slapped together.
143720	147720	So I am a big enthusiast of Avatar.
147720	151720	I absolutely enjoy the movies to the highest of heavens.
152720	153720	Cut.
156720	159720	Oh my God, I've not played this in years.
163720	165720	Oh, look, it's us.
165720	167720	Sigourney Weaver.
175720	177720	Big Sigourney Weaver, where you been?
177720	179720	We've missed you, Sigourney.
182720	184720	Don't screw up.
184720	185720	Got it.
187720	190720	This has not stood up to the test of time, graphics-wise.
190720	192720	My neck be bending.
192720	195720	My armpit textures are warped.
197720	199720	Oh, AC and Snow Berries.
199720	200720	Hi.
200720	202720	How was your puzzle game, AC?
202720	203720	I watched you in the bath.
203720	205720	Oh, this is really weird.
205720	209720	I was in the bath and I was like, I'm sure AC should be on right now.
209720	213720	And I opened up the game and you were like, this is a child's game.
213720	215720	How can I do this?
215720	217720	I thought I could do this because I think someone said,
217720	219720	why did you pick this game first?
222720	224720	Snow Berry Raid.
226720	230720	Yeah, there was like a big whale with loads of ropes all over it.
230720	233720	And I was like, I've never seen this game in my life.
233720	234720	I'm too dumb.
234720	235720	Did you not finish it?
235720	238720	Was it like a finished game or was it like one of those ones where it's like,
238720	240720	you just play for fun?
241720	243720	Is Sheevee's fault?
243720	245720	Sheevee, what did you do?
245720	246720	She put the ropes in.
246720	247720	Oh, that's very good.
247720	248720	Oh, you finished it.
248720	249720	Let's go.
249720	250720	AC Smart.
250720	251720	AC Smart.
251720	252720	AC Smart.
252720	254720	Hell's Gate.
258720	260720	Kendra.
260720	263720	Congrats if your name's Kendra.
263720	266720	Okay, so we are playing an RDA soldier.
266720	267720	Boots on the ground.
267720	270720	We are a signal specialist, okay?
270720	272720	We've just arrived at Hell's Gate,
272720	280720	which is where the humans have landed on the Navi's home planet, basically.
280720	288720	And the way that we humans survive is by sectioning off areas of Pandora,
288720	292720	because Pandora is so aggressive and dangerous.
296720	297720	Wendy, yes.
297720	299720	The big blue ladies.
299720	300720	Soon, soon.
300720	302720	Hold on, hold on.
308720	310720	You've never seen the movie before?
312720	313720	Okay.
317720	319720	How do you even summarize Avatar?
320720	322720	Just watch yourself around, Dr. Monroe.
322720	326720	He treats the avatars like his own personal guinea pigs.
326720	328720	This is a very old game,
328720	332720	and it is not a fair, like, assessment of what this game's about.
332720	333720	However.
333720	335720	However, however, however.
335720	337720	Too long didn't read.
337720	339720	Blue people good?
339720	340720	Humans bad?
340720	342720	Capitalism bad?
342720	344720	Being nice to the environment?
344720	345720	Good!
345720	346720	That's it.
346720	347720	That's all you have to know.
348720	349720	That's all you have to know.
349720	353720	You have completely caught up to the Avatar franchise,
353720	355720	as we know right now.
356720	357720	Bojinga, I think.
360720	361720	Brian?
364720	367720	Not me getting Brian back on the HUD.
367720	371720	Thank you so much, Bojinga, for the 13, I appreciate it.
371720	374720	I'm looking forward to this stream of this game that literally no one has played.
374720	376720	I wish I could do a poll right now,
376720	379720	but if I back out of this game,
379720	381720	it crashes super easily,
381720	383720	so basically,
383720	387720	I don't even know if I'm going for a toilet break today.
387720	392720	I looked it up and it said apparently the campaign mode is...
392720	394720	8 hours, but I don't believe it.
394720	395720	Yes.
395720	397720	We're at signal specialist.
397720	398720	I didn't even know there was an avatar.
398720	401720	Well, there's a new avatar game now, but we're playing the old-
402720	406720	Let me take a sip of my honey tea today.
406720	407720	Aloha.
409720	411720	Did you guys watch Mercy's ASMR?
411720	413720	Congrats to Mercy!
413720	417720	Mojie's been the only member of Euler to not get her VOD taken down
417720	421720	and leave a warning on her channel for sexual misconduct.
421720	423720	Give it up for Mercy!
426720	427720	Oh my God.
428720	430720	Let's go, Mercy!
433720	436720	I am so nervous for my ASMR stream
436720	440720	because I had planned something a bit special for it.
441720	442720	And...
444720	447720	YouTube are dancing with all of us right now.
449720	451720	Sorry, I'll get over the cutscenes first.
451720	454720	We get to experience being in a navi body for the first time.
454720	456720	If you haven't played, or don't know,
456720	462720	you enter a booth which neural links you to an actual navi body.
462720	464720	Don't look too much into it.
464720	467720	It's pretty fantasy-based and all that jazz, but yeah.
467720	470720	We are now in navi, we have access to a navi body,
470720	472720	but we are still RDA.
472720	473720	RDA's the bad guys.
473720	475720	Boo! Boo! RDA!
475720	477720	Navi! Yay! Navi! Yay!
477720	479720	But RDA, boo!
480720	481720	Go.
484720	486720	Oh my God, that neck!
486720	488720	That's killing me.
488720	490720	She looks like a giraffe.
490720	492720	Let me get over this bed real quick.
500720	503720	So we have just been introduced to our avatar body.
504720	505720	Navi body.
505720	507720	RDA mission complete.
508720	510720	So yes, this is a much older game.
510720	511720	We're just...
516720	518720	So we are about to...
528720	529720	Anyway.
529720	530720	She's pampering us.
530720	531720	It looks good for its age.
531720	532720	Honestly!
532720	534720	So the newest avatar, I haven't had an...
534720	535720	Oh!
535720	536720	Brian!
541720	543720	Bero, thank you for the 20.
543720	545720	Would you guys neural link with me?
545720	549720	Like, if you could go to bed, like, you see everything from APOV?
549720	550720	Would that...
550720	552720	Would I still be in control at that point?
552720	554720	Or would you want to control me?
554720	556720	Or would you want me to control you?
561720	563720	Do you really need to ask?
564720	566720	I don't know if you want to see my POV.
566720	569720	You just, like, dine and be really disappointed that I don't have big boobs.
571720	573720	Does the nicotine patch interfere with the process?
573720	575720	Nah, you can leave it on.
575720	578720	If anything, it makes it better when you're in.
578720	586720	So this is the reason we are in Pandora, the world.
586720	589720	You see those purple things underneath?
589720	593720	Those are the resources we mine from this planet for capitalism back on Earth.
593720	594720	It is crazy.
594720	596720	Honestly, I get to pray.
598720	601720	Hard to believe you're finally here.
604720	605720	A-turn!
605720	606720	Oop!
616720	617720	They're purple.
617720	619720	The resources are purple.
621720	623720	A big butt better than Big Boa.
626720	628720	We're here to get the blue oil.
628720	630720	Did someone say oil?
638720	642720	By the dawn, sparely.
642720	643720	Did I tell you?
643720	645720	In a voice chat,
645720	648720	I sung that, but I only know the first two lines.
648720	654720	And then freakin' Sheevie and Azura burst out into singing like the actual thing.
654720	657720	And I was like, oh my god, this is really...
657720	661720	I was getting serenaded by the dawn,
661720	663720	sparely.
663720	666720	I once prayed.
666720	668720	I don't know the words at all.
668720	669720	And I don't know why it's so hard.
669720	671720	Like, why does it go high?
672720	677720	Did you guys see my Twitter post about how much I got scammed on American sweets?
677720	679720	Hello!
679720	681720	So these are just basic transporters,
681720	683720	but as you can see, this is the whole map of Pandora.
683720	685720	We will unlock a few more locations soon,
685720	687720	but there's not really much detail to it.
687720	688720	We're currently at Hell's Gate.
688720	691720	We are going to get flown to Blue Lagoon,
691720	693720	but as you can see, this Earth is healthy.
693720	696720	There's lots of blues and greens and all that.
696720	698720	It's a nice, healthy Earth.
698720	700720	Blue Lagoon.
700720	702720	Open the game...
702720	704720	Oh, that's just the information thing.
704720	706720	I thought I was going to explain what Blue Lagoon is.
706720	709720	Blue Lagoon is where a lot of the navi
709720	711720	that are controlled by the RDA-side hangout
711720	716720	and a few of the tribes are tolerant to our behaviors.
716720	718720	Our human activities.
723720	726720	So this is Tutorial Island, essentially.
726720	728720	I thought this game was a fever dream.
728720	730720	It's real!
730720	732720	Hi, Stony. I remember playing this game as a kid.
732720	734720	Congrats, you're one of the two people
734720	736720	who have played this game that's watching right now.
736720	738720	A very, very underground game.
738720	741720	I'll tell you a very fun factoid about this game.
741720	743720	So obviously, I was an Xbox kid.
743720	749720	If you were able to obtain a copy of the special...
759720	762720	Oh, I loved that little animation.
762720	765720	This was probably before motion capture was even a thing
765720	767720	because what the heck was that?
768720	771720	Our encounter with Pandora's wildlife.
771720	773720	These are Viperwills.
773720	775720	They're terrifying.
776720	778720	But their designs are so good.
778720	781720	The animal designs are freaking amazing.
781720	784720	I am needing to remember.
784720	786720	That's to analyze.
786720	790720	Okay, so we have freaking special abilities.
790720	793720	For some reason, I can go and visit and shit.
793720	795720	But you can level up and progress
795720	797720	and make these abilities way stronger.
797720	799720	But literally, it's pretty insane.
799720	802720	The game's got loads of things going for it.
802720	805720	So right now, we're just defending the perimeter
805720	808720	from what way the game isn't too loud.
808720	810720	I cannot adjust the volume without breaking it.
810720	813720	We're just defending the perimeter from...
813720	815720	Oh, I almost just shot our own guy there.
815720	817720	Is it working?
817720	819720	Okay, there we go.
819720	821720	You do get XP.
821720	823720	There is a level-up system in this game as well.
823720	824720	I am so bad at aiming.
824720	827720	Holy crap, I don't remember it being this hard as a child.
827720	831720	Child Me is like so much better gamer
831720	834720	when it comes to this stuff, honestly.
834720	836720	Lollipop model confirmed
836720	838720	we're doing some reward.
838720	842720	Because, actually, why am I so much better at this game?
842720	845720	I know they spawn over there a lot.
845720	847720	Okay, objective complete.
847720	849720	Love to see you play the game,
849720	853720	but I will be very happy for every Navi I see die.
853720	855720	For the RDA for humanity.
855720	856720	You're joking.
856720	858720	You picked the RDA?
858720	859720	Who are you?
859720	860720	Iron Reaper?
860720	862720	You picked the freaking...
862720	864720	Why would you prick?
864720	866720	Oh, I literally just had a Freudian slip
866720	868720	and called you a prick there.
868720	870720	Why would you pick?
870720	872720	This is not the Navi.
872720	873720	Thank you for the 50.
873720	874720	That's insane.
874720	875720	Thank you for the 50.
875720	876720	Grab a buggy and help him out.
876720	878720	But you're wrong.
878720	880720	RDA Supremacy.
880720	883720	Reef Flames?
883720	886720	We're here for nature
886720	890720	and to be nice to wildlife.
890720	891720	I'm literally a cuttlefish.
891720	893720	Are you saying...
893720	895720	Oh, is this Halo Controls?
895720	897720	No, kind of.
897720	899720	You can be attacked when you go out,
899720	901720	but I will say one thing.
901720	902720	The motion sickness.
902720	903720	Merci.
903720	904720	If you're lurking, do not watch this.
904720	907720	This motion sickness on the vehicles is insane.
907720	908720	Oh, we're doing hit and runs.
908720	909720	We're doing hit and runs.
909720	910720	Get wrecked.
910720	911720	Oh, right.
911720	912720	I missed that, but whatever.
912720	914720	Oh, I can't remember much.
914720	915720	There is going to be...
915720	917720	This guy should...
917720	919720	There is like aim assist in this game.
919720	921720	So if you're bad at video games,
921720	922720	please don't worry.
922720	925720	If you ever think you might want to
925720	926720	get this game a shot.
926720	928720	You're a lifesaver.
928720	931720	This game is giving commands for keyboard,
931720	935720	but that's because...
935720	936720	Wait, wait, wait.
936720	937720	Butt bounce.
937720	940720	Wait, where the heck did it go?
940720	943720	I'm fighting.
943720	946720	Oh, we're going to stick them out to go down.
946720	947720	Oh, come on.
947720	948720	You can tell Kale as well,
948720	949720	which is really good in this game.
949720	951720	This game is definitely for people
951720	953720	who are not very...
953720	954720	I would say if you're new to gaming,
954720	957720	the game is very friendly to you.
957720	959720	I say that as I literally am forgetting
959720	962720	all the spawn locations of the enemies right now.
962720	967720	These are Viper Wolves.
967720	970720	Literally waiting until this game gets so beautiful.
970720	971720	I wish...
971720	974720	I don't know what the new avatar game is like genuinely about.
974720	975720	I heard those growls.
975720	976720	I heard that.
976720	979720	I have gamer sense, okay?
979720	981720	Oh, there's another one.
981720	982720	Jeez.
982720	983720	Whoa.
983720	986720	My trigger just got stuck there.
987720	990720	Are you squidding me right now?
990720	993720	Glory to humanity and cuttlefish.
993720	996720	Down with the navi.
996720	999720	No, the navi are the good guys.
999720	1000720	Slice Saber?
1000720	1002720	How dare you?
1002720	1004720	Thank you for the tip.
1004720	1006720	But the navi are the good guys.
1006720	1011720	We're supposed to protect humanity, okay?
1011720	1013720	Right, so we're currently saving
1013720	1015720	the current signal thing or something.
1015720	1017720	I don't know.
1017720	1018720	Tutorial.
1018720	1020720	We are doing tutorial, but I'm just spamming through it
1020720	1022720	because I want to be navi.
1022720	1024720	Just to be those dogs.
1027720	1030720	Everyone's literally so beefed up in this game for no reason.
1030720	1032720	Wait, you say navi's good guys.
1032720	1035720	Protect humanity.
1035720	1037720	The navi are the big blue ones.
1037720	1039720	The big blue ones protect nature.
1039720	1041720	We protect nature, okay?
1045720	1046720	We...
1046720	1048720	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
1048720	1049720	You ready for this?
1049720	1050720	We...
1050720	1054720	You want to protect nature, little reform.
1054720	1058720	You want to be a good boy for humanity.
1058720	1061720	You want to recycle where physically possible.
1061720	1063720	But we understand...
1063720	1064720	Oh, wait.
1064720	1067720	If the RDA are the bad guys, then why are their mechs so cool?
1067720	1069720	Checkmate, tree huggers.
1069720	1071720	Uh...
1071720	1072720	The rea...
1072720	1074720	Well, I'm gonna show you me absolutely wrecking
1074720	1076720	and fricking decking those mechs.
1079720	1084720	There's no way you guys are genuinely picking the human side.
1084720	1086720	Doomsday, Dan, you're getting a spank,
1086720	1087720	but thanks for the tip.
1087720	1089720	And Beijing got again.
1089720	1091720	No, you're wrong.
1091720	1093720	You have to be nice.
1093720	1095720	If I have to hit me...
1095720	1096720	Tree huggers!
1096720	1098720	If that makes me a tree hugger,
1098720	1099720	then guess what?
1099720	1101720	I'll proudly identify myself as a tree humper.
1101720	1102720	Oh, I just got...
1102720	1103720	Oh, I'm getting...
1103720	1104720	I'm getting...
1104720	1105720	I'm getting ganged up on.
1105720	1107720	I'm getting ganged up on.
1107720	1109720	Literally, the bark is peeling off from how hard
1109720	1112720	I'm humping the wildlife right now, okay?
1112720	1113720	Because...
1113720	1114720	I'm not...
1114720	1115720	I'm not...
1115720	1116720	Oh, um...
1116720	1118720	This is so much easier as a child.
1118720	1119720	Hello, child, me.
1119720	1120720	Can you just, like...
1120720	1122720	I don't know, possess my body right now?
1122720	1124720	Because why am I getting wrecked and decked?
1124720	1125720	There's...
1126720	1127720	Uh...
1129720	1131720	Oh, for goodness sake, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1131720	1132720	I'm getting wrecked.
1132720	1133720	I'm getting wrecked.
1141720	1143720	What'd you get?
1143720	1144720	Tim...
1144720	1145720	What the heck?
1145720	1146720	Tim Shuttle?
1146720	1147720	Tim Shuttle?
1147720	1148720	Your name is literally Cuttlefish.
1148720	1149720	A little Shuttlefish.
1149720	1151720	Glory to the hip, no toad.
1151720	1152720	Protect the Navi and the sea star.
1152720	1154720	See, Tim knows exactly what he's on about.
1154720	1155720	Thank you, Tim.
1155720	1157720	At least some of us have since...
1166720	1167720	Right.
1167720	1168720	You've got me there.
1168720	1169720	You've got me a wee bit there.
1169720	1170720	Hold on, hold on.
1170720	1171720	But give him a chance.
1171720	1172720	Give him a chance.
1172720	1174720	Thank you, Otter Von Biscuit.
1174720	1176720	Damn right you only sent for Cuttlefish.
1176720	1178720	We the best out here.
1178720	1179720	Wait, I just realized.
1179720	1182720	I think I'm supposed to drive the car in here.
1182720	1184720	Oh, I think I'm about to get attacked.
1184720	1186720	Or maybe those guys are protecting me.
1186720	1188720	I'm not sure.
1188720	1190720	There we go.
1190720	1192720	Run that, logist!
1192720	1193720	Oh!
1193720	1195720	See, you have level up system.
1199720	1202720	Um, I have terrible news for you.
1202720	1205720	If you want to do survival of the fittest, no weapons.
1205720	1206720	Absolutely.
1206720	1207720	Goodness.
1207720	1208720	Is this...?
1208720	1209720	Ah!
1209720	1211720	Take this!
1211720	1213720	Fart Bomb.
1213720	1216720	Thank you very much.
1216720	1219720	Sarge, IBW.
1219720	1220720	What a unique...
1220720	1221720	Thank you.
1221720	1222720	Thank you very much for the tip.
1222720	1225720	Sorry, Strony, but I'll never trust a species at...
1225720	1226720	Look.
1226720	1228720	All I'm seeing is give tentacles a chance.
1228720	1232720	I might be getting a little tentacle addition here and there, you know?
1232720	1233720	Am I going the wrong way?
1233720	1235720	It looks like I'm going the wrong way on the map.
1235720	1236720	I've not been here before.
1236720	1239720	Oh my goodness, the camera angle.
1239720	1241720	Look, the game aged all right.
1241720	1242720	I'm not going to say it aged well.
1242720	1244720	Wait, is there a little path back here?
1244720	1245720	No, there's not.
1245720	1246720	It's a lie.
1246720	1247720	It's a lie.
1247720	1248720	It's up here.
1248720	1251720	Oh my goodness, this camera angle is horrific!
1251720	1254720	I'm getting sick of myself.
1254720	1256720	Let me in!
1256720	1257720	Let me in!
1257720	1258720	I'm human!
1258720	1259720	What are you doing?
1259720	1261720	Okay, I actually have to go backwards?
1261720	1262720	Jeez.
1262720	1263720	Thank you.
1263720	1264720	Not Alessandro as well.
1264720	1265720	Rules of nature, survival...
1265720	1266720	Yeah, no.
1266720	1267720	Oh my goodness!
1267720	1268720	Wait!
1268720	1269720	Oh my God!
1269720	1270720	Lady driver moment!
1270720	1271720	Please!
1271720	1272720	Camera angle!
1272720	1273720	Please!
1273720	1274720	Jeez!
1274720	1275720	Louise!
1275720	1276720	Let me work here!
1276720	1277720	My goodness!
1277720	1278720	This is awful!
1278720	1279720	Why is the camera...
1279720	1280720	Oh my God!
1280720	1281720	This is horrific!
1281720	1282720	Are you kidding me right now?
1282720	1283720	Oh, thank God.
1283720	1284720	I don't get emotions like in the video games.
1284720	1285720	Do you not expect the message to work this time long?
1285720	1286720	Anyways, have fun, stroney and dreams.
1286720	1287720	Brian's back!
1287720	1291720	So when you tip, you can actually, like, act in here and you can hear it.
1291720	1294720	Thank you again for the another tip, Alessandro!
1294720	1295720	Eh, bitches.
1295720	1297720	When you tip, you will never be read out.
1297720	1299720	Oh my God, that camera angle is horrific.
1299720	1300720	Please.
1300720	1302720	Do not ever make me drive one of those again.
1302720	1303720	Thank you.
1303720	1304720	Oh, goodness me.
1304720	1305720	Right.
1305720	1306720	What is the heck is this?
1306720	1307720	I've forgotten.
1307720	1308720	Oh, it's a teleport pod.
1308720	1309720	Okay.
1309720	1311720	You can teleport between the different regions.
1311720	1314720	So this is all the Blue Lagoon areas.
1314720	1315720	Oh my God!
1315720	1316720	This is awesome!
1316720	1317720	Oh my God!
1317720	1318720	That camera angle is horrific.
1318720	1319720	Please.
1319720	1321720	This is all the Blue Lagoon area.
1321720	1324720	But as you can see, there's one, two, three, four, five.
1324720	1327720	Why are the teleport points all at the bottom and only one at the top?
1327720	1329720	Eh, I see how it is.
1329720	1331720	Make a mirror walk everywhere.
1331720	1334720	Okay, a little sip of my tea.
1334720	1335720	Have you played it?
1335720	1337720	Are you sure you've played this before?
1337720	1338720	The accusations?
1338720	1340720	I'm not beating the accusations.
1340720	1344720	Right, I'm going to finish my tea before it gets too cold.
1344720	1345720	Mmm.
1345720	1346720	I'm delicious.
1346720	1348720	I like the reverb effect on the verb.
1348720	1354720	I mean, I don't want to ruin anything, but that's definitely may or may not happen in
1354720	1356720	a certain ASMR stream.
1356720	1360720	I like freaking changed the title of the ASMR stream because I don't know what is going
1360720	1361720	on.
1361720	1363720	Everyone's getting warnings left, right and center.
1363720	1364720	Now don't get me wrong.
1364720	1368720	Any jumping up and doing on the bed is quite humorous, okay?
1368720	1372720	And I don't know, did she be actually doing anything that was that wrong?
1372720	1379720	Now the only reason I will say Azura had received that warning was on the pure basis.
1379720	1382720	Her voice is just like honey.
1382720	1387720	Her voice is the sun embracing you after a few days of rain.
1387720	1394720	Her voice is like that hug you have needed for years and you just let it all out and
1394720	1397720	you feel like her.
1397720	1405720	However, the other side of the coin for Azura's voice is it won't go down.
1405720	1407720	It can't stay down.
1407720	1412720	There's no such thing as a refractory period to her when you listen to her voice.
1412720	1414720	Maybe you'll get 10 minutes a piece at max.
1414720	1415720	You know what I'm saying?
1415720	1418720	So I kind of get why she got a warning.
1418720	1422720	I don't think she'd be got a warning because she was wise enough to private it.
1422720	1423720	I don't know.
1423720	1427720	I don't know if she did delete that.
1427720	1428720	Did she do ear licking?
1428720	1429720	Oh goodness me.
1429720	1430720	Can't even do a ear licking.
1430720	1434720	I don't know what's going on because people that show their face are still uploading all
1434720	1435720	fine and dandy.
1435720	1442720	So I think there might be a H-E-N update to the tie.
1442720	1444720	Possibly pop stealth policy.
1444720	1446720	Oh god, not the camera angle again.
1446720	1450720	I'm currently driving with one hand so this is going to go absolutely awful.
1451720	1453720	But look how big Pandora is.
1453720	1455720	It's fantastic.
1455720	1458720	One hand steering whilst I drink my tea.
1458720	1463720	I'm like a real contractor honestly.
1463720	1465720	Look, I'm just here to do the contract work.
1465720	1467720	I'm not here to do anything special.
1467720	1472720	I get paid on the day.
1472720	1474720	Okay, driving isn't actually that bad right?
1474720	1475720	Let's speed up.
1475720	1476720	Let's go.
1476720	1477720	Let's see if two handed.
1477720	1479720	I'm even worse probably.
1480720	1483720	Oh, I'm hitting the land.
1483720	1484720	I'm doing the Titanic.
1484720	1485720	Titanic momentum.
1485720	1490720	I am played this game when I was young and when I tell people about it, they never believe
1490720	1491720	it's real.
1491720	1494720	Also for the Navi, support nature.
1494720	1495720	Yes, thank you.
1495720	1497720	Thank you for the tip, Kitsune.
1497720	1498720	Gaming today.
1498720	1505720	Literally, I don't think I've really met anyone that's heard about this hecking game.
1505720	1507720	But I'm glad that a few of you actually have played it.
1507720	1511720	Okay, I'm just unlocking teleport stations when I do that.
1511720	1513720	Hi, hi everyone joining.
1513720	1514720	We're playing Avatar.
1514720	1516720	James Cameron's Avatar.
1516720	1521720	Some people thought it was Avatar, the last airbender related.
1521720	1523720	No, no, no, no, no.
1523720	1524720	Not at all.
1524720	1528720	Although, I think Amy might be doing a watch along that if you're into watch longs.
1528720	1533720	Please do think about supporting your local neighborhood little sister because she may
1533720	1535720	be doing a watch along that a little bit.
1535720	1537720	I'm going to take a little sipping tune of my cola.
1537720	1539720	I need to hydrate.
1539720	1543720	Now I get to ramble about all the work I did yesterday.
1543720	1546720	Okay, so the update is...
1546720	1547720	Are you squidding me right now?
1547720	1548720	Unless...
1548720	1549720	Brian!
1549720	1552720	Gaming in one hand while she stronts the cuddles in the other.
1552720	1554720	It's more difficult than you think.
1554720	1556720	Not that I'd know.
1556720	1559720	Honestly, thank you for the tip.
1559720	1560720	Tharja.
1560720	1563720	Tharja, I feel like that's not how you're supposed to pronounce it.
1563720	1566720	Are you Swedish and it's Tharja?
1566720	1567720	Tharja?
1567720	1570720	A little bit of a Swedish moment.
1573720	1576720	Look, it's that guy we saved in that cave only a few minutes ago.
1587720	1588720	What kind of cola?
1588720	1590720	Just cola cola.
1590720	1593720	Is it called Coke Zero when it's got the no sugar?
1593720	1596720	I finally went no sugar on the cola.
1596720	1597720	Aspartame.
1597720	1599720	I can finally tolerate aspartame.
1599720	1603720	It is that thing that is in the drinks to make it sugar-free.
1603720	1606720	But I was like, I don't mind having a big badonk-a-donk,
1606720	1608720	but I don't want it to get too big.
1608720	1610720	So I'm now drinking aspartame,
1610720	1613720	which apparently gives rats cancer.
1613720	1615720	So it's not looking good for us mammals.
1615720	1617720	But hey, oh, you got to die something.
1617720	1620720	And, you know, I'm not going out without enjoying myself.
1620720	1622720	That's all I'm saying on that much.
1622720	1623720	Right.
1623720	1626720	There are vapor wheels here, so please excuse the combat.
1626720	1627720	Boom.
1627720	1631720	Now you can just came to do this,
1631720	1635720	but it does bring you out of fricking invisibility.
1635720	1638720	Get in the boat, get in the boat, drive away, drive away.
1638720	1642720	Yeah, see, they get scared of my little fart bomb.
1642720	1645720	Actually, I think it's called a supersonic wave
1645720	1647720	and they don't like the noise, which makes sense.
1647720	1649720	You know, nature doesn't like loud noises.
1649720	1653720	Can relate on a physiological...
1653720	1654720	Physiological?
1654720	1656720	No, not physiological.
1656720	1660720	Oh, now you can just skip quite a bit of combat if you're cheeky,
1660720	1663720	but only if you're smart enough to do the things in the correct timing.
1663720	1664720	I'm going to heal up.
1664720	1667720	You can heal up naturally and it just means gentle for time.
1667720	1670720	As I said, this game is super forgiving to new gamers.
1671720	1675720	If you are into kind of that fantasy element, then...
1675720	1677720	Am I to walk from here?
1677720	1678720	I can't walk from here.
1681720	1684720	Nature doesn't like loud noises.
1684720	1686720	Literally the loudest of nature.
1688720	1691720	The sea bomb or a big badonka?
1691720	1692720	Those are the two choices.
1692720	1693720	I don't want to...
1693720	1695720	I don't mind getting too big.
1695720	1697720	No, sorry, I do mind getting too big.
1697720	1699720	You know, you got to keep that pear shape on.
1699720	1702720	You know, like when I do that hand cam stream,
1702720	1706720	everyone's going to know the real size of my chest.
1720720	1723720	Yes, I will teach you all the strats of this game.
1725720	1727720	For those who are wondering,
1727720	1729720	is this an adjourned stream?
1729720	1733720	This is roughly a seven hour stream.
1735720	1738720	So do feel free to stream yourself for the full seven hours.
1738720	1740720	If not, then the seven hour stream.
1741720	1742720	Roughly.
1742720	1748720	I believe we will actually successfully catch Mercy for a redirect
1748720	1752720	if my humble Mercy is streaming today, which I believe she is.
1752720	1755720	As always, if any of my gen mates come online,
1755720	1760720	please remind me and I will tell those who would much prefer to watch
1760720	1764720	a game that isn't archaic or whatever they're doing on stream.
1766720	1769720	We're supposed to for seven hours.
1769720	1772720	I feel like that would hurt.
1774720	1778720	But anyway, because I cannot tell you how strange it was
1778720	1781720	to go offline after two hours,
1781720	1784720	it literally felt like, what do we do now?
1784720	1786720	Oh, now we play the game.
1786720	1790720	Because I was like, wait, I have so much time and yeah.
1790720	1795720	So I've got three more ASMR collabs on the way.
1795720	1796720	I did a little bit of socializing.
1796720	1797720	We are now Navi.
1797720	1799720	We're about to do some Navi questlines.
1799720	1803720	But please remember, we are RDA Navi.
1803720	1807720	To use teleportations, we use the tree of vision.
1807720	1809720	It's very important to get those because my goodness,
1809720	1811720	it makes travel so much easier.
1814720	1817720	Look how tall we are and the camera angle has changed
1817720	1819720	and is much more favorable.
1819720	1825720	I prefer when video games have a really pooled out third perspective camera.
1825720	1829720	If the camera is two centimeters away from my face, I do not like it.
1829720	1831720	I find it very hard to look at.
1831720	1836720	I don't know if that's because I need glasses
1836720	1840720	and I still haven't trained myself to wear glasses.
1840720	1844720	Very bad girl, bad girl, very naughty.
1844720	1849720	But I think that my preference in video games is a zoom out angle.
1849720	1854720	It might be related to that because, yeah.
1854720	1860720	But hey, does anyone know the full name of the game and it's on Steam?
1860720	1865720	I don't even know if it's on Steam.
1865720	1869720	It is called James Cameron's Avatar.
1869720	1872720	Okay, the Navi can go through these doors.
1872720	1874720	Nope, only when they're green.
1874720	1876720	Okay, sure, sure.
1876720	1878720	We are about to encounter the wildlife.
1878720	1884720	They will still attack us even if we are Navi and RDA does not matter.
1884720	1886720	Where the heck am I going?
1886720	1887720	I'm going the wrong way.
1887720	1889720	That's why I'm getting turned around.
1889720	1891720	Now, again, we do have superpowers.
1891720	1892720	We have sprint.
1892720	1893720	We have invincibility.
1893720	1898720	We have health and we have ground smash, which is very good.
1898720	1906720	In order to get healing, if you look on when that health bar comes up again,
1906720	1912720	you'll notice the number zero at the bottom left on the right side of the health bar that appears bottom left.
1912720	1917720	The more cell samples we pick up, the more second chances we have.
1917720	1921720	Now, it's very common to run out of health in this game.
1921720	1923720	It's just the thing that happens.
1923720	1924720	It's not a big deal.
1924720	1926720	Again, the game's very forgiving.
1926720	1931720	You can literally do this all the way through the game and anything can hardly hit you.
1931720	1936720	But the later sections of the game, I don't know if there weren't many playtesters
1936720	1939720	because it was very rough in the later sections of the game.
1939720	1941720	I have to admit, it's getting pretty rough.
1941720	1945720	We are going to unlock this Tree of Vision, so now we can teleport to this region
1945720	1948720	when we come back to 100% the region.
1948720	1950720	You must be rider.
1950720	1952720	Let's get you up to speed.
1952720	1954720	How many games do you have lined up?
1954720	1955720	My apologies.
1955720	1957720	Do you mean to play in general?
1957720	1965720	If you mean games overall, like daily streaming games for a year?
1965720	1967720	Question mark.
1967720	1971720	Next week in endurance is Skyrim.
1971720	1973720	It's another childhood game of mine.
1973720	1980720	I used to do 100% achievements in Skyrim every year because I really appreciate the game and its vanilla form.
1980720	1984720	I do apologize if you like mods, but I don't know what to say.
1984720	1986720	Now we're among friends.
1986720	1989720	We aren't friends, so you need to learn quick.
1989720	1991720	We aren't friends?
1991720	1993720	Figure that out.
1993720	1997720	Would you guys, you know, would you guys really view?
1997720	1999720	What? 100?
1999720	2001720	You are one cool gal.
2001720	2005720	Fell in love when you started playing all my favorite games.
2005720	2008720	Also humans number one baby.
2008720	2009720	No!
2009720	2011720	I used to tactical strike every navi, every chance I got.
2011720	2012720	Anonymous!
2012720	2013720	No!
2013720	2014720	Bad boy!
2014720	2015720	Bad boy!
2015720	2017720	Thank you for the 100.
2017720	2018720	That's a lot of money though.
2018720	2021720	Please make sure you're looking after yourself and treating yourself.
2021720	2022720	100 is a lot.
2022720	2023720	Jesus.
2023720	2024720	Bad and on.
2024720	2025720	Bad boy.
2025720	2027720	Come get spankens right now.
2027720	2028720	Bad.
2030720	2032720	Let me take a sipping tin.
2032720	2034720	Are you squiddin' me right now?
2034720	2035720	Goodness me.
2035720	2038720	Can't believe the reflings are betraying mama like this.
2038720	2039720	SMH.
2039720	2040720	Exactly, Nero.
2040720	2042720	Don't worry though, strongy.
2042720	2044720	I'll never betray nature.
2044720	2045720	Must protect the navi.
2045720	2047720	Exactly, we stand nature in this house.
2047720	2048720	We will look after nature.
2048720	2053720	As you see me, you can literally hear me dancing about in my chair right now.
2053720	2057720	So we are, what the heck is that zone?
2057720	2058720	And why is it so big?
2058720	2059720	Oh, we're plant sampling.
2059720	2062720	Okay, this is tutorial section.
2062720	2064720	When I explained, thank you for the tip again, Nero.
2064720	2068720	Anonymous, my goodness, that was a lot of money.
2068720	2070720	Play, is something attacking me?
2070720	2071720	No.
2071720	2075720	When you pick up cell samples, there's that little white bar on the left side.
2075720	2079720	I didn't, and you thought there was enemies because I was like, why am I getting, playing
2079720	2080720	as an avatar?
2080720	2094720	As an avatar, pondora's flora, which means flowers, and fauna means animals.
2094720	2095720	Yes.
2095720	2100720	As less aggressive towards you, therefore, killing and offensive creatures and plants
2100720	2104720	will not yield experience points.
2104720	2109720	All the reeflings siding with humans want to be the guy from strongy's lore video.
2109720	2110720	Oh, I'm so bad.
2110720	2113720	Hope a siren doesn't drown me in the ocean.
2113720	2114720	Thank you.
2114720	2117720	Thank you, Anonymous, for the tip.
2117720	2122720	Oh, you guys don't want me to, you know, take you down in the waters with me, that's not.
2122720	2124720	Honestly, my lore is so evil.
2124720	2128720	I promise, I don't want to, I don't want to hurt.
2128720	2129720	What?
2129720	2131720	Why do I suck so bad at this?
2131720	2133720	Wait, what was that?
2133720	2136720	No way, they have a slow motion kill cam.
2136720	2140720	I did not recall that whatsoever.
2140720	2142720	That's amazing.
2142720	2144720	Don't threaten us with a good time.
2144720	2146720	That sounds very yandere-esque.
2146720	2149720	But yeah, in terms of evilness in lore, why?
2149720	2150720	What was that?
2150720	2151720	I heard that.
2152720	2153720	I can hear it.
2153720	2155720	I actually got scared there.
2155720	2159720	I heard it, but I couldn't turn the analog stick in time.
2159720	2161720	So if I am human-
2162720	2165720	Why are there so many?
2165720	2167720	Oh no, I heard the plant.
2167720	2169720	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Mr. Plant.
2169720	2171720	I'm actually getting a bit scared.
2171720	2173720	Why is there so many?
2173720	2176720	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
2176720	2177720	Pause.
2177720	2179720	Pause, I hear more.
2179720	2181720	Oh my god, they're literally biting my ankles.
2181720	2183720	They're biting my ankles.
2183720	2187720	Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
2187720	2189720	Stop.
2189720	2191720	Okay, relax.
2191720	2194720	Relax or just collect and sell samples in this area.
2194720	2196720	I think I've hurt every...
2196720	2198720	All the enemies are gone.
2198720	2201720	Yeah, so these type animals don't attack.
2201720	2204720	They can't bite my ankles, man.
2204720	2206720	If you are human and come across this plant,
2206720	2208720	it is very poisonous.
2208720	2212720	It spits a bale at you, which is actually really cool.
2212720	2216720	But the design elements that went into this game
2216720	2218720	is just beautiful.
2224720	2227720	But yeah, the development, you can actually...
2227720	2229720	Yeah, you can scan...
2229720	2231720	Who goes there?
2231720	2235720	You can scan stuff and add it to a database and that.
2235720	2237720	I've never 100% of that.
2238720	2241720	Oh no, we can't because I would have to play the RDA side.
2241720	2243720	But I'm not playing the bad boy side.
2243720	2246720	But yeah, if you're into 100% completion,
2246720	2248720	absolutely you can do that kind of thing.
2254720	2258720	But it is a very beautiful game.
2258720	2261720	I am very much into alternative...
2263720	2266720	I saw that, it popped up my little thingies.
2266720	2268720	I knew it.
2276720	2279720	We can do this and just kind of try and bypass
2279720	2281720	all the enemies on the way.
2281720	2283720	Enemies.
2283720	2285720	Did you watch the second movie?
2285720	2287720	I absolutely did.
2287720	2291720	I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie with Jake Sully.
2291720	2293720	Absolutely.
2293720	2295720	I love your names, Jake, by the way.
2297720	2300720	Absolutely fantastic movies.
2300720	2303720	Completely captured me in that kind of fantasy,
2303720	2307720	different world, especially the night time scenes
2307720	2309720	when everything is lighting up.
2309720	2312720	Speaking of lighting up, hold on.
2316720	2318720	Reactive model, you ready?
2318720	2320720	Reactive model, do you want this?
2320720	2322720	Or do you want my normal model?
2322720	2324720	I can turn over in it.
2324720	2326720	The bioluminescence scenes.
2326720	2328720	Yes, bioluminescence scenes.
2330720	2333720	Pushing boots to destroyed Avatar 2 in the box office.
2333720	2334720	Nah.
2337720	2340720	Woo, our first meet with a navi.
2340720	2342720	Like an actual navi, not an RDA navi.
2343720	2344720	Are you ready?
2344720	2346720	Hello, Tanjala.
2346720	2350720	Oh, I'm stuck on this corpse of a theme of Ober.
2350720	2351720	Hello.
2351720	2353720	Hello, I'm on a kayak.
2358720	2360720	This is good.
2364720	2367720	Oh, Renee Harper is a corny weaver.
2367720	2369720	She's been poused with a navi.
2369720	2370720	She overslept them.
2370720	2375720	Tanjala wants you to kill the sick, strong beasts.
2375720	2378720	Anyone else identify themselves as a strong beast?
2379720	2381720	That's ridiculous.
2381720	2384720	We're really starting to dig hard for these words.
2386720	2388720	Avatar 2 had no story at all.
2388720	2390720	A perfect how not to make a sequel.
2390720	2392720	I disagree.
2392720	2393720	Brian!
2397720	2398720	Exactly!
2399720	2401720	Exactly, Grimble.
2401720	2403720	Thank you for the tip.
2403720	2404720	We do, Brian.
2408720	2410720	I have not seen fair and golly.
2410720	2411720	Bajinga!
2411720	2412720	Thank you for the tip.
2412720	2413720	What's fair and golly?
2413720	2415720	Have you guys seen fair and golly?
2415720	2418720	Are you doing what you eat?
2418720	2421720	You like Sigourney Weaver a lot.
2421720	2425720	So, Sigourney Weaver, the first thing I've seen her in.
2425720	2427720	Oh, we're just to destroy these, by the way.
2427720	2431720	Sigourney Weaver Avatar was the first thing I ever saw her in.
2431720	2433720	And I just adored her.
2433720	2434720	I adored her character.
2434720	2437720	Her voice is so lovely as well.
2437720	2439720	It's such a...
2439720	2441720	If you ever struggle at this point,
2441720	2443720	just jump up on this rock right here.
2443720	2444720	They can't...
2444720	2445720	Oh!
2445720	2447720	They can't hurt you if you go on the rock.
2447720	2448720	They can't do a thing.
2448720	2450720	If you're on the floor, these guys will knock you over
2450720	2453720	and take a big chunk of your health.
2453720	2455720	Is something else attacking me?
2455720	2456720	No.
2457720	2459720	But we're good to go.
2461720	2463720	Robin Williams plays a bat in this.
2467720	2471720	Fair and golly is basically the Barbie Pixie...
2471720	2474720	The Barbie Pixie movie in 2D, but human...
2474720	2475720	What?
2475720	2477720	And humans are bad guys.
2477720	2478720	It was a good movie.
2478720	2481720	The direct to VHS sequel was...
2481720	2482720	Okay.
2484720	2485720	Tim Curry sings.
2486720	2488720	Oh my god, Rocky Horror Picture Show.
2488720	2490720	You put your hands on your leg.
2490720	2492720	No, that's not right.
2492720	2493720	You put your hands on your hips.
2493720	2494720	That's it.
2494720	2496720	I find a dance inside.
2500720	2501720	We should watch that.
2501720	2504720	My mum really likes that movie.
2504720	2506720	So I've watched it from a young age.
2506720	2509720	Yeah, it's absolutely bizarre to conceptualise
2509720	2512720	what on earth happens in that movie at a young age.
2512720	2513720	But hey ho!
2513720	2514720	That's just life.
2514720	2515720	That's just how it is.
2515720	2516720	We're going to...
2516720	2517720	Oh!
2517720	2518720	I heard.
2518720	2519720	Butta dog.
2519720	2520720	Dog with a butta.
2520720	2521720	I heard that.
2521720	2522720	And mama.
2522720	2524720	Get your butt to the top of that.
2524720	2525720	I want that.
2525720	2527720	What are you doing here?
2527720	2528720	I'm so tainy.
2528720	2530720	Oh no, I'm so big.
2530720	2532720	POV, you're Azura?
2532720	2534720	You're talking to Azura right now.
2534720	2536720	This is the hate difference between you and Azura.
2536720	2537720	What's going on?
2537720	2538720	I'm shutting down the knob.
2538720	2539720	It's Emmy and Azura.
2541720	2543720	Oh, we Emmy.
2544720	2546720	A giant woman.
2546720	2548720	No, don't lie.
2548720	2551720	Don't lie right now.
2551720	2555720	And say to me, I didn't cook with making Azura a giantess.
2555720	2557720	I will not take...
2557720	2558720	Right, if that's not going to hurt me,
2558720	2559720	I'm actually just going to leg it.
2559720	2560720	I'm legging it, boys.
2560720	2561720	We're doing it.
2561720	2562720	We're doing it.
2562720	2563720	We're doing it.
2563720	2564720	Oh!
2564720	2565720	Wah!
2565720	2566720	Wah!
2566720	2569720	Right, we're just going to stealth through this section.
2569720	2571720	There's a lot of dire wolves.
2571720	2573720	Eh, viper wolves.
2573720	2576720	However, we're no interested in fighting.
2576720	2578720	So, we're just going to zoom past
2578720	2582720	because this entire section is optional, honestly.
2582720	2584720	We're just going to zoom ahead again.
2586720	2587720	Cooked.
2587720	2588720	You did indeed cook.
2588720	2592720	No, I knew I wanted some sort of thick Vtuber model.
2592720	2594720	I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.
2594720	2597720	There's really not that much variety for the thick
2597720	2599720	and for the chocolate.
2600720	2603720	So, it was just absolutely no questions asked.
2603720	2605720	Probably going to do the same in Gen 2
2605720	2608720	where, you know, something's going to be lovely in Gen 2.
2608720	2609720	Brian!
2609720	2611720	Didn't expect Sigourney Weaver to side
2611720	2614720	with the Navi considering her history with aliens.
2617720	2619720	Is she the main...
2619720	2621720	Is she the main alien?
2621720	2623720	Because I remember reading a really...
2623720	2625720	Oh, we're on a horse, by the way.
2625720	2626720	Check it out.
2626720	2627720	Look at my horse.
2627720	2629720	My horse is amazing.
2629720	2631720	Oh my God, its face is all...
2631720	2634720	That's a really unfortunate face.
2634720	2636720	Everything else, yeah, that's all right.
2637720	2638720	Look, I'm riding a pony.
2638720	2639720	I'm such a girl.
2641720	2643720	Oh my God, this is the girls game as well.
2643720	2644720	Oh, no.
2644720	2645720	Oh, there's actually really...
2645720	2646720	This is really boring,
2646720	2648720	but when we come back to this section later,
2648720	2650720	an enemy always spawns on this rock
2650720	2653720	and he's infinite stuck and you can never, like, hurt him.
2655720	2656720	Okay.
2657720	2658720	It's time.
2658720	2660720	We need to make a decision.
2660720	2661720	Are we Navi?
2661720	2663720	Thank you very much, Iron Reaper, for the tip.
2663720	2666720	I think I actually forgot to say that, but thank you for the tip.
2666720	2668720	Are you squiddin' me right now?
2668720	2669720	Nero!
2669720	2672720	Speaking of, how tall is Stacy Milketon?
2674720	2676720	Thank you, Nero, for the tip.
2678720	2682720	So we are a signal specialist
2682720	2684720	and we've set those signals up,
2684720	2686720	but we were told that they weren't gonna...
2686720	2689720	It wasn't gonna be used for destroying Navi.
2690720	2692720	Nori, nori.
2694720	2695720	Ah!
2717720	2720720	So we're learning we just destroyed all the Navi's home.
2723720	2724720	It's work.
2734720	2736720	Are we the baddies?
2743720	2744720	Raider?
2744720	2746720	Hardly even nor.
2748720	2750720	Oh wait, sorry, sorry, hold on, do that again.
2751720	2752720	Raider?
2752720	2754720	Hardly even nor.
2766720	2768720	Come on, how goofy is that?
2769720	2771720	I wanted to see...
2771720	2772720	Raider, are you ready?
2772720	2773720	Are you ready?
2773720	2774720	We're gonna do it again.
2776720	2778720	Okay, hold on, let's do this bit
2778720	2780720	and then when we're mucking about I'll do it again, okay?
2780720	2781720	That was amazing.
2783720	2786720	Right, so this is where you decide.
2786720	2788720	Do you want to be Navi or do you want to be RDA?
2788720	2790720	If I shoot him, we become RDA.
2790720	2794720	If I shoot him, we become Navi
2794720	2796720	and defend this Pandora
2796720	2798720	in the name of being a foreigner.
2798720	2799720	We need to kill it.
2799720	2800720	We guys first go.
2801720	2802720	Destroy him.
2802720	2803720	Just...
2803720	2804720	Oh, I'm low health.
2804720	2806720	Oh my God, I'm farting about too much.
2806720	2807720	Oh, why is he so strong?
2807720	2808720	Right, go.
2809720	2811720	Wait, I'm actually gonna get...
2811720	2813720	I think I'm actually gonna perish.
2813720	2815720	He's like actually wrecking and decking me.
2815720	2816720	What's going on?
2817720	2818720	Why is his health not going down?
2818720	2820720	Why is my aim bought so bad?
2821720	2823720	Right, hold on, hold on.
2823720	2825720	Hold on, let me aim bought.
2825720	2826720	He healed up!
2826720	2828720	No, no!
2828720	2830720	Only I'm allowed to heal up.
2831720	2833720	The enemies shouldn't be allowed to heal up.
2833720	2835720	It should be illegal in video games.
2835720	2838720	Development team, you have failed.
2838720	2839720	It should be...
2839720	2841720	Why is he only shooting me as well?
2841720	2843720	Can you like shoot that other guy?
2843720	2844720	Right, hold on.
2844720	2846720	Let me readjust this aim bought.
2846720	2847720	No, he healed up!
2847720	2849720	Only I'm supposed to be healed up!
2849720	2850720	Right, that's it.
2851720	2852720	Grim pound!
2853720	2854720	It didn't even work.
2854720	2855720	Did it work?
2855720	2856720	I don't know.
2856720	2857720	I'm gonna be honest.
2857720	2859720	This is a few too many bullets are going through you.
2859720	2861720	I spoke too many bullets.
2861720	2862720	Sudden darts.
2863720	2865720	He survived all those bullets.
2869720	2870720	I gotta go now.
2870720	2871720	Grab your dire horse.
2872720	2873720	Dire horse?
2873720	2874720	Banshee!
2876720	2878720	Ik-nee-ma-ya.
2878720	2880720	Ik-nu-ee-ma-ya.
2880720	2882720	No idea who I'm supposed to see.
2882720	2883720	Ik-nee-ma-ya.
2883720	2885720	Ik-nee-ma-ya.
2885720	2887720	Sounds like I'm trying to say something in the dark.
2887720	2889720	The RDA doesn't do anything piecemeal.
2890720	2891720	Ik-kawanyo?
2892720	2893720	It's not Ik-kawanyu.
2896720	2898720	Got anything better than bows and arrows?
2899720	2900720	They defend their homeland.
2900720	2902720	Those are the only weapons they need.
2902720	2903720	Great.
2903720	2904720	Good choice, Ryder.
2904720	2905720	Ik-nee-ma-ya.
2905720	2906720	That's what I'm saying now.
2907720	2909720	Couldn't humans kill the main guys?
2909720	2910720	Human body in the machines?
2910720	2911720	Yes.
2911720	2912720	That's very true.
2912720	2915720	But it was arranged that the...
2915720	2916720	Look out!
2916720	2917720	Oh, look out!
2917720	2918720	We stunning on them.
2918720	2919720	Look at this.
2919720	2921720	Got a little outfit of the day moment check.
2922720	2923720	Come on.
2923720	2925720	Look at my jewel-wield blades.
2925720	2926720	Come on.
2926720	2927720	That's so cool.
2927720	2928720	Oh, how did I hit?
2929720	2930720	That's so cool.
2930720	2931720	Come on.
2931720	2932720	That's so cool.
2932720	2933720	I'm sorry, but look how cool that...
2933720	2934720	Oh, my God!
2934720	2935720	That's terrifying.
2935720	2936720	Imagine that running at you.
2938720	2941720	Oh, I just cracked myself right there.
2942720	2945720	Your avatar isn't blonde because blonde doesn't exist in Navi.
2945720	2946720	I don't think...
2946720	2947720	Maybe it does.
2947720	2948720	I don't know.
2948720	2949720	I don't think I've recall seen a blonde Navi.
2949720	2950720	Oh, no.
2950720	2952720	I do in the different regions of...
2952720	2954720	But we are jungle Navi.
2954720	2955720	This is jungle Navi.
2955720	2957720	There's different types of Navi.
2958720	2959720	Or jungle Navi.
2963720	2965720	Sadly, not closer to your level plus.
2979720	2981720	We need to win his approval.
2983720	2984720	Oh, my God.
2984720	2985720	She's so real for that.
2985720	2986720	That's...
2990720	2993720	Okay, we need to try and get the approval of this guy.
2994720	2995720	Why?
2996720	2999720	I've already forgotten the plot, but we're going to do it anyway.
3000720	3002720	But basically, we are full Navi right now,
3002720	3004720	and I'm going to tell you something.
3004720	3006720	Okay, this really is a girls game,
3006720	3008720	because every time we go to the next location,
3008720	3010720	we unlock new outfits as we level up,
3010720	3012720	and I get to like play a little wardrobe simulator.
3012720	3013720	Such a girls game.
3013720	3014720	That's such a girls game.
3019720	3022720	Yeah, he ain't happy at all to see me in.
3024720	3027720	Oh, I need to be able to raid a Banshee or an Ikran.
3027720	3028720	That's what they're called.
3031720	3032720	Oh, my God.
3032720	3033720	Blanky.
3033720	3034720	Hold on.
3034720	3035720	I need to get what's the link,
3035720	3036720	because I'm hurting my legs against the table.
3036720	3037720	Ooh.
3037720	3038720	Did I just skip dialogue down that?
3038720	3039720	Oopsie daisy.
3040720	3041720	New outfits.
3041720	3042720	Let's go to the next area.
3042720	3043720	Oh, my God.
3043720	3044720	Fashion Simulator.
3044720	3046720	We played Landlord Simulator on Brotherhood.
3046720	3049720	Now we're playing Fashion Simulator on Avatar.
3050720	3051720	Right.
3051720	3055720	We are about to learn a motherfucking bow and arrow.
3056720	3058720	Oh, did not mean to do that one.
3058720	3059720	Let's try that again.
3059720	3060720	Pardon me.
3060720	3061720	Excuse me.
3061720	3062720	That was very daft.
3062720	3064720	I just absolutely threw myself off the mat there.
3065720	3067720	How does zooming on the bow and arrow again?
3067720	3068720	Not that one.
3069720	3070720	Oh, wow.
3070720	3071720	It's just hold and release.
3071720	3072720	Okay.
3072720	3073720	Who would have thought?
3074720	3075720	Who would have thought?
3075720	3076720	It's just holding release.
3077720	3079720	The Navi's drip is indeed real true.
3080720	3083720	This game seems surprisingly competent, actually.
3083720	3084720	I was doubting.
3084720	3085720	I get game.
3085720	3086720	It is.
3086720	3087720	Honestly, I get game.
3087720	3088720	Wait.
3088720	3089720	What am I doing?
3089720	3092720	Oh, we're doing our first human kill.
3092720	3093720	Oh.
3095720	3096720	Yeah.
3096720	3098720	The aim is very forgiving.
3098720	3100720	If you want an easy game.
3100720	3103720	Definitely recommend this game.
3103720	3106720	The bow and arrow is very satisfactory.
3106720	3108720	But I'll tell you one thing though.
3109720	3110720	Oh, look at this camera.
3110720	3112720	Look how terrible this camera like pings off of different.
3112720	3118720	Like you can see the markers of where they put the tracking to do that.
3118720	3119720	Like it's not smooth.
3119720	3120720	Like.
3121720	3122720	Oh my God.
3122720	3123720	Who goes there?
3124720	3125720	Identify yourself.
3127720	3128720	I need to jump.
3130720	3133720	First human after killing two low level.
3133720	3134720	So actually true.
3134720	3136720	I just recalled that.
3136720	3140720	Really, really willy nilly killing over here.
3141720	3142720	Any willy killers?
3142720	3143720	No, don't.
3144720	3147720	This is another armor we kind of get to unlock about later on.
3147720	3148720	It's not quite the same.
3149720	3154720	But here we speak to bar a word for it.
3161720	3164720	I hear you betrayed your own kind to be here.
3164720	3165720	Yeah.
3165720	3167720	How soon will you betray us?
3168720	3170720	It will take more than this offering.
3170720	3172720	The scale of the arrows are massive they are.
3172720	3174720	Like Navi are so big.
3178720	3180720	So there wasn't a big tree in the game?
3180720	3183720	Oh, we aren't at the end of the game yet.
3183720	3185720	You just hold on to that thought.
3185720	3187720	You're a couple of missions ahead.
3187720	3189720	But I like doing this.
3195720	3198720	They don't disconnect us for treason, honestly.
3201720	3204720	She wants the braid tails?
3205720	3207720	What happens if we braid tails with each other?
3209720	3210720	Is that like a marriage proposal?
3210720	3211720	Is that Navi?
3211720	3212720	We braid each other's?
3218720	3219720	He will not show it.
3219720	3220720	Oh, that's his wife?
3223720	3225720	Come, we must destroy Sky Tower.
3226720	3227720	We find these.
3228720	3229720	How will you say?
3229720	3230720	Take care.
3231720	3232720	Will you help us?
3232720	3234720	These boxes are explosives.
3234720	3235720	TNT?
3236720	3237720	Yes.
3237720	3238720	We have word for this.
3239720	3240720	Kangangang.
3241720	3242720	Kangangang.
3242720	3243720	Oh, that's so satisfying to say.
3243720	3244720	Kangangang.
3248720	3249720	Is that a TNT?
3249720	3250720	Kangangang.
3251720	3252720	I messed with that.
3252720	3255720	You can flip into the waterfall to get down here a bit faster
3255720	3257720	than going all the way around the map.
3258720	3259720	I will heal.
3259720	3260720	I shouldn't have done that.
3260720	3263720	I thought you could slip down without too much.
3263720	3265720	Oh, you have 50 bow.
3265720	3267720	And every time you get a sample,
3267720	3270720	you replenish your bow and arrow ammunition.
3270720	3273720	So all those green is more bows.
3275720	3276720	Genghis Khan?
3276720	3277720	Okay.
3277720	3278720	You're done.
3280720	3281720	Excuse me.
3281720	3282720	Pardon me.
3282720	3283720	Coming through.
3283720	3284720	You guys can't aim.
3284720	3285720	Oh, I can't aim either.
3285720	3286720	It's fine.
3286720	3287720	Okay.
3287720	3289720	I think because my keyboard is registering.
3289720	3290720	Hello?
3291720	3292720	Hello?
3293720	3294720	Okay.
3294720	3296720	I think because my keyboard is registering,
3296720	3301720	the aim assist isn't being as active as it is normally
3301720	3304720	on Xbox.
3304720	3307720	Because I could have sworn I didn't even have to aim.
3309720	3310720	Conta.
3312720	3313720	Jeez.
3313720	3314720	They just disappear.
3314720	3315720	Okay.
3315720	3318720	We seem to get either 5 or 10 arrows from samples,
3318720	3320720	which is pretty good.
3320720	3321720	I would say that's pretty good.
3322720	3323720	Kangangang.
3323720	3325720	Hans was simulator, actually.
3325720	3327720	I prefer the born hours myself,
3327720	3329720	but I'll tell you something that's really sad about this game.
3330720	3332720	As we level up,
3332720	3335720	our equipment also becomes stronger in nature.
3335720	3336720	Okay.
3336720	3337720	However,
3337720	3341720	if you did not purchase the special edition,
3341720	3345720	which they made about 1000 copies of for some unknown reason,
3345720	3348720	if they didn't do the special,
3348720	3349720	if you didn't buy it,
3349720	3352720	your bow does not one-shot the enemies as you level up.
3352720	3354720	It is complete nonsense.
3354720	3357720	They made only so few copies.
3357720	3359720	I was like,
3359720	3362720	oh, do you see how that flower attack is attacking them
3362720	3365720	and they're taking poison damage?
3365720	3367720	So unfortunately,
3367720	3368720	our bow and arrow,
3368720	3370720	I can't even see them through the...
3370720	3372720	Bra, why are you missing?
3372720	3373720	Bra.
3374720	3377720	You do heal over time naturally when there's no fight,
3377720	3379720	so you don't always have to spam heals.
3379720	3380720	What's this?
3380720	3381720	What's that?
3382720	3383720	Ammo.
3383720	3384720	I thought my ammo...
3384720	3385720	Whoa!
3385720	3387720	Wait, what do I have access to?
3387720	3388720	So dual wields,
3388720	3391720	one big ass swing,
3391720	3394720	a gun and a bow, right?
3394720	3396720	I normally just stick the bow.
3396720	3397720	Very good.
3397720	3399720	Very good, very nice.
3401720	3402720	But overall,
3402720	3404720	game is very forgiving.
3405720	3407720	If you're ever interested,
3407720	3408720	we should do that,
3408720	3409720	but that comes later.
3409720	3410720	We'll always come...
3410720	3411720	Oh!
3411720	3414720	The acran just said bye to that.
3414720	3416720	I'm pretty sure they would have got mowed over,
3416720	3417720	but like,
3417720	3418720	as long as they're happy,
3418720	3419720	I'm happy.
3420720	3421720	So right now,
3421720	3423720	we're picking up our boom boom Genghis Khan.
3423720	3424720	Do you mind?
3425720	3426720	Where did you come from?
3426720	3427720	You weren't even there.
3427720	3429720	You're such a liar.
3429720	3430720	You're lying.
3431720	3432720	Where are they?
3432720	3433720	I hear them.
3435720	3436720	Snipe,
3436720	3437720	and not snipe.
3437720	3438720	I am low health.
3438720	3439720	That's okay.
3439720	3441720	We're gonna heal up like that.
3441720	3442720	She can heal up.
3442720	3443720	And then we're just gonna move.
3443720	3445720	Oh, we're not gonna move on to the next section.
3445720	3446720	We're gonna go invisible.
3446720	3448720	Oh, no, we're not.
3448720	3449720	Can you still...
3451720	3453720	I don't know if you saw that.
3453720	3455720	Those flies were attacking him.
3455720	3456720	Like literally,
3456720	3458720	Pandora is so nice to you when you're napping.
3458720	3459720	I love it.
3459720	3460720	Oh, I hear them.
3463720	3465720	Oh, so these are bombs
3466720	3467720	that fly into you.
3467720	3469720	I'm pretty sure I heard a guy's voice though.
3471720	3472720	I'm like 99% sure.
3472720	3474720	I heard a guy saying they're out there,
3474720	3475720	but I didn't see it.
3476720	3478720	I love the way you say jaw wield.
3478720	3479720	Oh, no.
3479720	3481720	Wait, does it say differently?
3481720	3482720	Jew...
3482720	3483720	Jewel wield?
3484720	3485720	Jewel weel.
3486720	3487720	Jewel.
3488720	3490720	Pandora thinks humans are an infection.
3490720	3491720	They are.
3491720	3492720	They're terrible.
3495720	3496720	When you play RDF,
3496720	3497720	it's just as truly similar.
3497720	3499720	Oh, that's hilarious, honestly.
3502720	3504720	It's such a good game.
3504720	3505720	Such a good game.
3505720	3507720	I love this game so much.
3509720	3512720	The only complaint I have about this game,
3512720	3515720	it was made when games like to do...
3515720	3516720	Why?
3516720	3519720	It's like I have to aim a little to the right.
3519720	3520720	I do.
3520720	3522720	I've aimed a little to the right.
3523720	3525720	We can go down or up.
3525720	3529720	My memory says up, question mark.
3530720	3533720	Jewel wield.
3534720	3537720	Well, my memory was correct.
3538720	3539720	Oh!
3539720	3541720	He got a little ambitious
3541720	3543720	for trying to hurt me there.
3543720	3544720	Where is this?
3544720	3545720	It's up there?
3545720	3546720	Oh, it might be up there.
3546720	3549720	Whoa, I just spotted you in the corner of my eye.
3549720	3551720	Yeah, these are literally...
3551720	3553720	You know, I don't know what they're called.
3553720	3556720	Those bombs that are for submarines under the water.
3556720	3557720	I don't know what their name is,
3557720	3559720	but that's what those are, but in the air.
3561720	3562720	Oh, I missed.
3563720	3565720	Yeah, the aimball in this game,
3565720	3566720	working!
3567720	3568720	Aimball, please!
3570720	3572720	Wait, he didn't perish?
3572720	3573720	Jeez.
3575720	3577720	It looks like they're...
3577720	3579720	Oh, we need to shoot that.
3579720	3580720	Hold on.
3581720	3582720	Wait, do we actually?
3584720	3586720	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
3586720	3588720	Don't remember this part of the game, geez.
3591720	3593720	What's the rocks for?
3593720	3595720	Am I to destroy these?
3596720	3597720	No way.
3599720	3601720	Yeah, so I'm using bullets too.
3602720	3603720	Un-ball, un-mort.
3603720	3606720	More like, sent-ball, un-mort.
3608720	3610720	Why? The aim assist is not like me.
3610720	3613720	I'm not actually going to claim that tree of nature.
3613720	3614720	That's what...
3615720	3617720	The travel point, because...
3618720	3619720	Holy crap.
3619720	3621720	Oh, no, I don't have unlimited ammo!
3623720	3625720	Bruh! I thought I had unlimited ammo!
3627720	3628720	Jeez.
3628720	3630720	What did that do as a child that made...
3630720	3632720	It really must just be the aim assist.
3632720	3635720	Because I think if you all one-shot everything,
3635720	3638720	there's like no way this stuff is even hurting me half as much.
3638720	3639720	Oh, I missed.
3639720	3641720	I shot, and I missed again.
3641720	3643720	And then I shot, and then I missed again.
3644720	3645720	And again.
3645720	3647720	I don't know how to unshoot.
3647720	3648720	I can't pick up ammo from that.
3648720	3650720	I can only pick up ammo shells.
3652720	3653720	Honestly!
3653720	3655720	Let's see if we can get away with this.
3655720	3658720	Because we just need to pick up the package and then go.
3658720	3659720	Oh, wow.
3659720	3660720	Okay, cutscene time.
3660720	3661720	Cutscene time!
3661720	3662720	Whoa!
3664720	3665720	Gang, gang, gang!
3665720	3666720	Gang is gone!
3670720	3672720	Okay, let's get the heck out of here,
3672720	3675720	I don't want to get hurt anymore than we need to.
3675720	3677720	I heard that belief and I was going to go for it.
3678720	3680720	I think we're about to get on her screen.
3685720	3687720	Long story short, I missed.
3687720	3689720	Yeah, I missed again.
3689720	3690720	And then I shot.
3690720	3691720	And then I shot.
3691720	3692720	And then I missed again.
3694720	3695720	Thumb arrived.
3695720	3696720	Alright.
3701720	3703720	Okay, we're about to climb.
3703720	3705720	Climb, climb, climb, climb!
3707720	3710720	Yeah, I think the campaign mode is roughly 7 hours.
3710720	3713720	We could probably come back in 100% the sectors.
3713720	3716720	And we can also play this mini-conquest game,
3716720	3718720	which actually I really enjoyed as a kid.
3718720	3721720	But you have to do it at the end of the game
3721720	3723720	for like 100% success rate.
3724720	3727720	There are Viper Wolves ahead,
3727720	3730720	but we're just going to be cheeky and do this.
3730720	3732720	And then we completely negate
3732720	3734720	even having to fight a lot of them.
3735720	3740720	Unfortunately, invisibility...
3740720	3745720	No, invincibility is when they can't hurt you.
3745720	3748720	Invisibility is when they can't sneeze.
3749720	3750720	It doesn't last forever,
3750720	3752720	but as we level up...
3752720	3753720	Like...
3753720	3755720	Oh, actually we're really close to leveling up.
3755720	3756720	I don't know if I should...
3756720	3757720	I don't want to hurt the wolves.
3759720	3760720	I don't want to hurt the wolves,
3760720	3762720	but I'll kill the humans, no problem.
3762720	3763720	Yeah, no, that's fine.
3763720	3764720	That's fine.
3766720	3767720	Yeah, that thing, that thing.
3767720	3768720	It's friendly fire on.
3769720	3771720	No, you cannot hurt other navi
3771720	3772720	now that you're a navi side.
3772720	3774720	I assume it's the same if you pick RDA.
3775720	3776720	Oh, good snipe.
3778720	3779720	Oh, good snipe.
3780720	3783720	Okay, if I can take my time to properly aim.
3784720	3786720	No, I think I was out of range.
3786720	3788720	There is a range to your attacks.
3788720	3789720	Like, you can't...
3789720	3791720	Oh, well, I just suck.
3791720	3792720	There we go.
3792720	3795720	There is a range distance to your attacks.
3796720	3797720	I cannot for the life of the human.
3797720	3799720	Am I to go this way?
3801720	3803720	Am I to go this way?
3803720	3805720	No, classic dead end.
3805720	3806720	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
3806720	3807720	Mom, get the camera.
3807720	3809720	Play of the game, honestly.
3809720	3812720	Did you guys see that Marvel Superhero,
3812720	3813720	like 5v5?
3815720	3816720	I hear a bomb.
3817720	3818720	I see a bomb.
3819720	3820720	Um, um, um, um, um, um,
3820720	3822720	I really don't want the bomb to get me.
3822720	3823720	Oh, I'm already out of in this.
3824720	3826720	And the bomb is chasing me.
3826720	3827720	Okay, we're doing it.
3827720	3828720	We're just going for it.
3828720	3829720	We're committing.
3829720	3830720	Did anyone play it?
3831720	3832720	Marvel rivals.
3832720	3833720	Yeah.
3833720	3834720	It looks so good.
3835720	3837720	Everyone was, like, dogging on it,
3837720	3838720	but I'm like,
3838720	3840720	oh, I actually really enjoyed the look of it.
3842720	3843720	Uh,
3844720	3846720	I'm installing the game now
3846720	3847720	just to kill the Navi.
3847720	3848720	You know what?
3848720	3849720	You're done.
3850720	3851720	You're done.
3852720	3853720	I'm definitely going to play
3853720	3854720	Marvel Overwatch when it comes out.
3854720	3855720	Yeah, and then wasn't there
3855720	3857720	not another company
3857720	3858720	that came out with another
3858720	3859720	Overwatch-style game?
3859720	3860720	I think it was Marvel.
3860720	3861720	It was a company that came out
3861720	3863720	with another Overwatch-style game.
3863720	3864720	I think development teams
3864720	3866720	literally watched, like,
3866720	3868720	the mess up in real time.
3868720	3870720	I don't know if that thing's still chasing me, but,
3870720	3871720	um,
3872720	3873720	there is another one.
3874720	3875720	Yeah, like Scarlet Witch
3875720	3876720	with Moira and all that.
3876720	3877720	Yeah.
3877720	3878720	I used to play a lot of Overwatch.
3878720	3879720	I actually really enjoyed the game,
3879720	3881720	but I just don't play it anymore.
3881720	3884720	Like, I don't find it rewarding,
3884720	3885720	or,
3885720	3886720	which is such a shame,
3886720	3887720	because I've poured
3887720	3889720	a lot of hours into that game.
3889720	3890720	Um,
3891720	3892720	but I would absolutely love
3892720	3894720	if we could do Marvel rivals together
3894720	3895720	as, like, a stream snag game.
3895720	3897720	Like, um,
3897720	3900720	I don't know how the accounts work,
3900720	3902720	but I'm, like, 99% sure
3902720	3903720	I can make a dummy account,
3903720	3904720	and then, like,
3904720	3906720	add users' friends,
3906720	3909720	and then make note of who's, like, played,
3909720	3910720	and then just rotate between,
3910720	3911720	like, kind of what we...
3911720	3912720	Oh, here we go.
3912720	3913720	Level up.
3913720	3914720	What did I unlock?
3914720	3915720	Let's see.
3916720	3918720	Uh, Bam Knee Pack.
3918720	3921720	We have a club weapon with frickin' spears on it,
3921720	3924720	or another type of RDA gun.
3924720	3925720	Oh.
3925720	3926720	And a shot.
3926720	3927720	And a missed.
3927720	3928720	Oh, and a missed again.
3929720	3930720	I can hear an enemy.
3930720	3931720	I don't see him.
3931720	3932720	Oh, there he is.
3936720	3938720	That wasn't him that said that.
3938720	3939720	Oh well.
3939720	3940720	Whatever.
3940720	3941720	Whatever.
3941720	3942720	Um...
3943720	3945720	Blizzard is horrible with their IPs yet.
3945720	3947720	Time to go back to Team Fortress 2.
3947720	3948720	Honestly?
3948720	3949720	But I'm sh...
3949720	3952720	I could have sworn I saw another development team
3952720	3954720	come out with something that was similar
3954720	3955720	out to the format as well.
3955720	3958720	So I think, literally, everyone watched,
3958720	3959720	uh, Overwatch 2 come out,
3959720	3963720	and as soon as Jeff Kaplan left the development team,
3963720	3966720	I think everyone behind the scenes
3966720	3968720	knew what on Earth was up
3968720	3969720	and knew it was, like,
3969720	3970720	essentially gonna flop
3970720	3972720	due to the, uh,
3972720	3974720	change in...
3974720	3975720	gameplay.
3975720	3978720	But when Marvel Rivals does come out,
3978720	3979720	uh,
3979720	3981720	because I think it's in beta right now,
3981720	3982720	or...
3982720	3983720	I may be wrong,
3983720	3984720	um,
3984720	3985720	I'm happy to make a dummy account.
3985720	3986720	We'll make it a multiplayer game,
3986720	3987720	and, uh,
3987720	3989720	we'll just kinda...
3989720	3990720	uh,
3990720	3991720	add in,
3991720	3992720	uh,
3992720	3993720	I think it's 5v5,
3993720	3994720	so it means four reeflings of myself
3994720	3995720	can play at the same time
3995720	3996720	against, uh,
3996720	3997720	just randomers.
3997720	3998720	Um,
3998720	3999720	we'll, like,
3999720	4000720	play actual public match games,
4000720	4001720	uh,
4001720	4002720	unless you guys
4002720	4004720	really wanted to go against each other.
4004720	4009720	I'm not sure having me and your team
4009720	4010720	will be a good idea though,
4010720	4011720	cause I'm not very strong at the game
4011720	4012720	cause I've yet to even play it.
4012720	4013720	Um...
4013720	4014720	But if that's something you guys
4014720	4015720	are down for,
4015720	4016720	I'm heking down for it as well,
4016720	4017720	uh,
4017720	4018720	obviously,
4018720	4019720	uh,
4019720	4020720	we'll
4020720	4021720	remove everyone
4021720	4022720	at the end of the gaming session
4022720	4023720	and restart fresh.
4023720	4024720	As I said,
4024720	4025720	it'll be
4025720	4026720	pow!
4026720	4027720	I saw that,
4027720	4028720	I don't know if I'm
4028720	4029720	gonna get ahaaa!
4029720	4030720	Right,
4030720	4031720	I'm backing off,
4031720	4032720	I'm backing off.
4032720	4033720	I don't think
4033720	4044960	down yet. No. That part comes later on. I didn't know. I'm gonna pick this up. Team
4044960	4051240	Landers, Johnny. Oh, should I tell everyone what to do? Protect me, heal me, heal me.
4051240	4062480	I used to play Zarya, which is an offensive tank. Over what? Oh my god, they're so beautiful.
4062480	4073400	The music's changed. Oh, they're so beautiful. The ikran. Look at them all judging me. Oh,
4073400	4081360	that's okay. You can judge me. Look at them. They're so pretty. Hello. Please don't attack
4081360	4091080	me. They're so beautiful. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Please understand. This game's a little old, which
4091080	4096240	is why they're all the same color. Please forgive. Please forgive. But I assume the new avatar is
4096240	4102960	like really beautiful. And my ikran literally almost made me perish and then said, yeah,
4102960	4107880	all right, I'll pick you up. I got pranked by it. I literally done a little pranky on me.
4107880	4118920	A little pranky-wanky. Oh. No. No. It's not a good look, honestly. I mean, you would really choose
4119160	4128680	match over Mecha over the big birdie. Exactly. Why would you pick? Oh, look at us. We're so
4128680	4144040	lying. There's no an RDA that will leave alive because the resource destroying the Pandora.
4148040	4153480	Oh, I love fly. Oh, ow, ow. Sorry, your wing, your wing. My apologies. Sorry.
4154200	4161400	I didn't mean to hurt your wing, little Banshee, but thank you for being so forgiving.
4162200	4168600	But we're just flying through the map now. Banshees have an insane HP. We will be shot at as we go
4168600	4177000	around. I don't know if you read that really quickly. It said lifting the fog 50%. Don't worry.
4177000	4181800	Oh, we really need to get some height. Oh, I'm going to do a little cheeky 360 to get that
4181800	4189320	height there. We are about to reach the ceiling in this game. Oh, all right. Climb. Climb. Jeez,
4189320	4194680	this map has a lot of verticality. Definitely did not remember that. But yes, there was a
4194680	4200120	sector challenge that says lifting the fog. There's a few sector challenges. Depending on how long
4200120	4208840	the campaign takes, we might actually just 100% all the sections. Oh, excuse me, game.
4209800	4219160	I know for a fact I flew over that. Would you like to register me flying through this?
4219960	4225960	No. Oh, okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Women moment. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Lady drive.
4225960	4231320	Okay, there we go. There we go. You got it in the end. I'm sure this is like really beautiful
4231320	4236440	cinematic if you do. Oh, we got it. Okay, but we're hitting that rock. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Look,
4236440	4241560	the camera angle isn't, it's not that easy to freaking dive, dive. All right, then go up,
4241560	4249080	go up, go up. Hey, there we go. But yes, Banshee are a really good way to get around these maps.
4249800	4256600	Whoa, easy, easy, easy. And we are back to the start where we started. Look at us going.
4257480	4262680	Isn't that beautiful? Okay, I am going to say before we start this next quest,
4263080	4268600	there is a voice line that repeats consistently through this mission. I will try to get through
4268600	4275400	it as fast as possible. It is so annoying. It is so annoying. Genuinely so annoying,
4275400	4280040	horrifically annoying. Unless this isn't the mission.
4285560	4286600	Don't say that.
4293160	4296360	Maybe this isn't the mission I thought it was.
4299480	4306280	And where are the turkeys? Audio bugs are the worst. Is that Ubisoft game? It has to be.
4308280	4313160	The, the animals slowly regretting letting you drive them, honestly. Okay, no, it's after this
4313160	4320120	mission. They're really annoying when pops up. What did we unlock? A crossbow and some sort of
4320120	4330760	ability. Hold on. How do I open that? Skills? Kinetic dash, Ewa's breath, Titan bash I don't
4330760	4337240	really use. We could maybe replace it with, Calls of Hyperwolf to your side. It'll fight for you
4337240	4343800	for a short time. That's pretty cool. Honestly, bees, death by bees. Right, here we go. What the
4343800	4348920	heck am I supposed to do? I completely forgot. Right, we're going to raid or a crane. Can I go on you?
4350920	4355080	Okay, look. Oh, he's going forward. I never really,
4355080	4360360	Hey, Ostrone, I'm off to work. But if the stream ends up being a bit longer,
4360360	4364440	then I should be back in time. See you after work. Hope to catch you there.
4365160	4371640	Thank you, tiny spiny. I appreciate the tip. And yes, um, I did look it up. I said the game
4371640	4376120	takes around seven hours to complete. If we come back and do section stuff that wait,
4376280	4381560	that where am I? That land? I think I'll land up here. Yeah. Okay. It looks like I'm definitely
4381560	4388600	to land to keep that crane safe up here. You stay there, buddy. You be nice and safe. But
4388600	4391960	yes, have a good day at work. Thanks for hanging. I appreciate it. And I appreciate the tip too.
4394040	4396760	I'm not to say donations because it's not a donation. It's a tip.
4397880	4402040	Actually, I don't know if I'm supposed to update the girls as things to be like,
4402760	4406760	you know how you're supposed to put like a disclaimer on like the freaking thing in case
4406760	4416680	someone does a charge back. Right. I'm 99% sure these guys just keep respawning. So I'm actually
4416680	4425560	not to fuss. Do you mind? Thank you. I'm not to fuss for completely clearing up the section.
4425720	4437560	Oh, it's a bomb. It's a bomb. Okay, there we go. Let's go up. Is that about to like blow up right
4437560	4443800	next to me? Oh, I didn't. Oh, no, we didn't kill guys don't look at explosions. You know the drill.
4443800	4448040	Okay. You know the drill. Kill guys don't look at explosion. Well, you mean stream,
4448040	4454760	elements is intact. I like some if someone does like a thing, a disclaimer for charge right would
4454760	4460520	be I'll probably edit the motor then or when I get off. I don't know. I get tired. I get tired
4460520	4469000	after screaming. Okay. Oh, I have a fantastic update for scripts. Oh my goodness. So the script
4469000	4478360	manager now has access and is taking over and look. So everyone has a four part series coming out
4478360	4486200	like a story that kind of progresses. Sheeby's four part series is currently being written right
4486200	4492760	now. I'm not trying to say anything, but good luck trying to hold it together when she performs that
4492760	4500840	script. Because wow, I was blown away. I'm like, there's definitely like something to be said about
4500840	4506760	like a guy writing a script versus like what I could write because I just like I like challenging
4506760	4513320	myself and in general like I know what overall you'd like us to say type thing. But I have to
4513320	4520200	admit I was like, oh my god, there's not going to be any anything left in the sack after that one.
4520200	4526680	And that was part one I read. I didn't even read the finalized series of it. And Azur's one is being
4526680	4535560	worked on next. Oh my god. Sorry. I didn't I wasn't paying attention to like how many bad guys are
4535560	4540280	there? Right, we're going to watch the explosion this time because we can. What's the explosion look like?
4541720	4545080	Okay, it was just kind of out of control. Oh no, the tower does go down. Okay, I like it.
4545800	4551880	I wonder if we can get some XP for destroying this. Ow. Okay, we can get XP for doing that.
4552920	4561560	I think, why didn't? Azur's story, I don't I don't know if I should ruin what the story is. Like,
4561560	4565560	I don't want to like tell stuff that's kind of like exciting for the girls.
4567880	4574440	But like, I like the four part series ideas, like Emmys one I really like. No, don't spoil it. Okay,
4574440	4579160	I won't spoil it. Um, oh, there's a home tree right there. Actually, I don't know if I should grab it
4579160	4584280	the now. Actually, no, I have access to the Ikaran to fly around the map. So it's not going to be that
4585160	4593480	a deal of us coming back. Newbie would begin a work is a lot. Yes, I like so now that like the
4593480	4600040	scripts are no longer my problem, I get to focus on making the girl short. So Mercy came out with
4600040	4604600	a short and she was like, do you do you think I should have been blonde Senpai and showed like
4604600	4609800	behind the scenes artwork? I'm going to get everyone to do that to show their concept art like me as
4609880	4614840	well. Actually, I need to write the scripts. And like, I get to work on that kind of fun stuff
4614840	4623400	instead of kind of like being stretched too far. Like, it's too easy. It's too easy. I'm not even
4623400	4630120	going to say it's that easy. Um, you can go as well because you were shooting my crime. You're
4630120	4637160	not supposed to shoot my crime. Um, literally, spoiler channel is always looking for literally,
4637400	4643240	uh, just I get so excited about everything that's planned behind the scenes that I'm like, oh,
4643240	4648040	I don't want to ruin it for the girls. Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
4648040	4652520	here, here, here, here, sorry, sorry. I'm too busy rambling. I'm not even actually focusing on the
4652520	4662040	dang game play. Wait, oh no, we don't want shot them anymore. They've gotten too strong now. That's
4662040	4673000	the problem. If you don't like, um, farm XP, you will fall behind. Concept art was great to
4673000	4677160	see. Yeah, so I get to like kind of do that fun behind the scenes script stuff like the shorts
4677160	4689240	for the girls. Um, um, also super gracious thank you to everyone who is using YouTube clip feature
4689240	4696280	for the girls. Um, if you didn't know, if I go on their stream, I can see who and what has been
4696280	4702200	clipped. I just want to say, uh, there's actually quite a few people who are clipping my burps at
4702200	4707480	the moment. I might unironically make a 15 minute burp compilation just for the heck of it and call
4707480	4713800	it like scrawny burps for 14 minutes and 53 seconds. Uh, and just for the heck of it because
4713800	4720120	it seems to be something, uh, a few, uh, gentlemen seem to enjoy and you know, I'm not here to ruin
4720120	4726360	anyone's day. Uh, but yes, please do consider clipping. We have a really funny, uh, short of
4726360	4733720	icy coming soon. Um, our second clipper, we're kind of testing them out. I don't have a problem
4733720	4738040	because I've already actually got extensive clip history, but they're busy at the moment. So the
4738040	4742360	clips are a wee bit slow to be produced. We're getting there. We're getting there. So thank you
4742360	4747800	to anyone who uses a YouTube clip feature. Does help out any highlight moments? A short of icy
4747800	4754680	doing what? So it's already happened. So it's not a spoiler, but AC basically when,
4755640	4763160	in her adorable voice, like, I'm not very smart. And then she went, thank you so much, Mike, honey,
4763160	4768520	for donating to me and her adorable freaking accent. And I'm like, AC,
4769480	4774920	ACICAL. Should I have taught you that? Should I have said to you what that means?
4777480	4780920	So we're going to, we're going to get turned into a clip, not really sure on her thing.
4782360	4787000	But her accent is so freaking adorable. Okay, I'm going to bed. Rest well. See you in the morning
4787000	4791880	when you wake up, sweet dreams. I love seeing that. I love seeing that. Whenever you guys are like,
4791880	4795000	okay, I need to go to work or I need to go to sleep. I'm like, yeah, see you in the morning. See you
4795000	4798680	in the morning. Oh yeah, work or I'll see you after work. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you didn't go out
4798680	4804840	do some errands. I'll see you after that. I'll still be on. Right. This is the scene. The quote is,
4804840	4811320	Raider, you have got to get to higher ground. It will be repeated a ridiculous amount of times.
4812280	4817320	Yep. I remember the quote. I've not even played this game in many a year. Raider, you've got to
4817320	4823160	get to higher grounds. It will repeat. And I'm like, did no one play test this? Did no one see what
4823160	4829800	an issue this is? Because I've gone the wrong way. I've gone the wrong way. Oh, and I've hurt
4829800	4838120	myself. Let's hurry this up. Who's this section? Oh my God, imagine that coming at you. I would
4838120	4845400	actually be so terrified. Shawnee, you've got to get to higher ground. Honestly. Get that done.
4846280	4851240	Get that done. Right. We destroy one way.
4853240	4857720	Oh, I love it. Love it. Special. What's right? Oh, no. What's my special?
4863160	4867400	I don't know what button the special is, though. Yes, we spawn at checkpoint.
4867400	4871000	It's putting, it's giving me keyboard input, but I'm playing mouse and controller. Like,
4871000	4874600	I don't know if you can hear my analog stick. Right. Let's do that. Another try.
4875320	4881160	That was a bit daft. I do apologize for that MLG game. I'm going the wrong way again.
4884120	4890920	I can't all be good at video games. Literally, wherever nine year old me is inside my head right
4890920	4896520	now, can you like come and like help us out here? Because this is getting very good. It's getting
4896520	4903240	embarrassing. Right. I'm going to click the analog sticks this time to see if that's what the special
4903320	4910280	is instead. Right. Special analog. Nope. That's, uh, nope. That's scan.
4911720	4916600	What would R, what would R be? Am I literally, you know what? I'm just going to hit R and my
4916600	4923000	keyboard. Are you squinting me right now? Oh, Stronny, you've got to get to higher ground.
4923000	4927320	No, Anna, don't throw me. It's so, wait, why is this not breaking?
4928040	4935560	Is there a health bar? Oh, there is. Oh, is it glitched out? I can see that health bar,
4935560	4943800	that little green. What's going on? Thank you for the tip, Anna. Wait, I think it's glitched out.
4944600	4950200	This is an old game. Hold on. Let me do this. I'll do it with a bigger one.
4950600	4962200	Uh, game. Game, you're showing your time. I've never actually had it glitched out here before.
4969480	4975240	Right. I had to press F on the keyboard. I don't know what button I was supposed to press on the
4975240	4981320	freaking, I'm, I would, oh, I keep saying it. Literally, where do you've got to get to higher
4981320	4990840	ground? I literally F in the chat. That's, oh, oh, oh, you're getting whacked, mate. Oh, then you fall
4990840	4998840	now. Oh, he's hiding in the freaking bushes. Right, healing up, healing up, healing up. Don't
4998840	5005320	worry, don't worry. Uh, actually, I think these are much faster. Yeah, these are one shot. The
5005320	5012360	dual wield is one shot, but the long stick isn't one shot. Hmm, what does that mean?
5014280	5017480	Right, okay, we're just going to press the keyboard. We're literally just switching
5017480	5020280	between the keyboard and the ticket thing. I don't know what I'm supposed to press.
5020920	5028200	Get whacked for free, must be nice. Is that the honor you should be watching by any chance?
5029560	5035960	Hmm. Uh, right down we go. I don't know. Are you squiddin' me right now?
5037480	5039960	Virginia! Have you considered getting to higher ground?
5039960	5045880	Stop! No, I'm getting trolled! Thank you for the tip, for so. He repeats it so much,
5045880	5051960	but he's not doing it right now. I wonder, because I don't know why he's not repeating it,
5052680	5058840	but I kid you not, he constantly repeats, you have got to get to higher, you have got to get to
5058840	5066600	higher ground. Over and over and over and over. But, uh, I think we're actually being given,
5067400	5075560	oh, objective. The classic three and done in video games. If Aintbroke don't fix it,
5075560	5082280	do this thing three times and you win. Delicious. Delicious, delicious, delicious.
5083880	5092600	Love it. I love it when game devs get the memory. Oh my god, I'm inside that! I'm inside it! Leave
5092600	5103240	alone! No! Oh no, I'm a... Oh, that's not good. I'm having a seizure.
5108440	5116360	Home tree! Oh, wait a minute. I think I might have died and now I'm at home tree and I'm about to be
5116360	5121720	spiritually be a navi. Like, yeah, spiritually. I'm like physically about to be like 100%
5121720	5133400	navi if I remember correctly. Oh yeah, that's right. Oh, I can feel myself connecting with nature.
5134120	5138440	Oh, I should...
5151560	5152840	Are you with me right now?
5153480	5154280	Wah!
5158680	5164200	Heck yeah, speak for the trees. Thank you, Tim Shotol. For the tip. I can never say that
5164200	5166280	name right. Shotol. Ah!
5171560	5178120	Eh, AWA just resurrected me and AWA's word is truth, so I will not be taking any contesting
5178120	5179960	points that I'm no a navi anymore.
5183560	5189640	Actually, I really enjoyed the second Avatar movie because what's her name? The one that
5190440	5194120	is Sigourney Weaver as a child? I really like her plot line.
5197880	5202280	Eh, that she's like, can commune with AWA? I really like her.
5206200	5209240	Avatar Stoney has an arrow under her hair!
5213800	5217640	There's a second Avatar movie? Yeah, it's called Way of the Water.
5219320	5222040	Did you not get advertised on anything?
5224200	5230440	There's a second Avatar movie. It's out right now. I may have just spoiled it for you. I apologize.
5233320	5236360	If I was home tree, I would tell Stoney to...
5237080	5243560	If I was the home tree, I would tell Stoney to... I don't know what he want.
5244200	5248120	What are you on about? What are you on about?
5248680	5254520	This is a spiritual location. You can't loot the home tree.
5255480	5260120	Okay, I say that as if there isn't a Gen 2 concept right now that may or may not have
5261080	5262600	have some nun influence.
5265640	5270600	You cannot do any activated mission things. Oh, it's the guy!
5273080	5274920	Nothing but more than pure digging.
5279000	5280280	My new abandoned name.
5282520	5285560	Advertising for the second movie was a booze ball.
5286520	5290200	It still did really well, did it not, if I'm not mistaken?
5291480	5294120	Are you underestimating the power?
5298200	5302440	You acting like the tree? Well, it's the Holy Spirit of Navi.
5303800	5310600	Okay, we are going to Swatulu. Anyone else visited Swatulu?
5310600	5313080	Maybe on spring break you went to Swatulu?
5313720	5315800	Yeah, they are absolutely wrecking this place.
5318360	5322680	This is not... This area is definitely getting absolutely wrecked.
5325240	5328680	I just remembered what happens in this area. I'm like Nightmare Potenture.
5332840	5335480	Very good location because something very cool happens.
5335800	5337640	We aren't searching for the dormant site.
5342680	5344920	No, actually, I think it's a later level, you know that?
5347160	5347880	Anyway, it's cool.
5349480	5353000	The first movie itself was already advertised enough for the second.
5353000	5354600	That's probably what they said.
5354760	5368440	That was really outrageous writer, I'm going to be honest.
5368440	5373640	Saying no hablo to a Navi. I don't know, that felt a bit weird to me.
5373640	5375080	I don't think we should let that one slide.
5375880	5379240	That was... That was motivated. That was motivated.
5379960	5380840	That was bizarre.
5381800	5386280	And if you're literally fully Navi, you're not going to put effort into speaking Navi?
5387080	5390360	We're going to unlock the home vision tree. What the heck is that?
5393080	5396040	Oh, it's a tree of vision. Oh, it's a sector challenge.
5398200	5401240	Am I crazy or was there a horse I could ride back here?
5403320	5408360	Thank you, child, me for remembering. Oh my god, I'm actually so smart.
5408440	5411480	What are you? You're just menacingly guarding this horse.
5411480	5413400	Can I just take it? Thanks mate, appreciate it.
5429800	5434920	There are RDAs, but the beautiful thing about these parts of the map,
5435480	5438760	you can ignore it. You can just zoom ahead.
5439400	5442840	This is one of those games where if you want to take your time and explore it,
5442840	5445880	you most certainly can. But if you just want to be like,
5445880	5449720	right, I want to do the objective. I don't want to leave the horse in the middle of here.
5449720	5453240	What am I doing here? Oh no, I don't want my horse to...
5453240	5455960	Wait, investigate. Oh, I'm only to do a drive-by?
5455960	5458440	Oh, I can do a drive-by shooting all right. Don't mind me.
5459240	5459880	Oh, let's go.
5463480	5466200	Right, I don't think you can shoot well on horseback.
5466200	5468760	Sorry, dire horse. It's called dire horse.
5469800	5471560	But yes, I don't mind doing a drive-by.
5473480	5476360	Right, left or right? Both are terrible.
5477240	5481320	This one's a dead end, so do the dead end first and then come back for the open one
5481320	5485880	because it's likely that the open will be like the next progression.
5486840	5489880	Oh, my wee horse is getting injured.
5491320	5494920	Shattered village. Yeah, looks absolutely desolate.
5495800	5500600	Okay, I think the game's putting horses around the map in case we do end up losing.
5500600	5502520	Can you put like samples on horseback? You cannot.
5503480	5510040	Flex and then roll in arse. What do you mean you cannot roll your arse?
5510040	5513960	Can you not iterate what you wish to rock on?
5514920	5517720	I'll just start shoving ours and words that don't even have it.
5517720	5520760	Oh, my poor horse. Oh, it's a mech. It's a mech. It's a mech.
5520760	5523160	It's a mech. Oh, the horse is going to perish.
5523160	5526040	Oh, no, the horse is perishing this game. I don't like it here.
5527080	5528200	Let's get out of this place.
5532120	5535880	Is this the first game? It is. This is not the new game that came out.
5535880	5539640	This is the Archaic 2009 game.
5540360	5545400	Loongeree is not here. Where is Loongeree?
5546440	5550360	Loongeree, where are you, mate? I need to find Loongeree.
5554040	5558920	Any Loongeree fans? I'm a Loongeree fan. Oh, the horse is getting in.
5559560	5560680	Loongeree's gone to stop them.
5564920	5567400	With Unipee. That's right, Riflin.
5571800	5573000	Oh, Unipee's a person.
5574840	5580280	Oh, what did we unlock? Let's see. The Onatopak.
5582440	5585080	What is that? That looks like shards from the sky.
5585960	5588840	That looked cool. I've not actually summoned a horse.
5588840	5592600	What was that? Birds from the sky? Column Pandora to help strike.
5593960	5596360	Oh, my God. Hold on. What does it look like?
5600200	5604120	Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Little baby. Little baby clangs.
5605160	5608040	Okay. Great. We can go through here.
5608760	5615400	Oh, I'm getting shot at. Or is he shooting at an NPC? I don't know.
5615400	5616840	Hello. Do you need assistance?
5621560	5625400	She just expired. I don't know. I don't even speak Navi.
5625400	5628280	I don't even know what her last words were. Oh, my God.
5628280	5630600	Her family's going to be like, what were her last words?
5630600	5633880	And I'm like, I'm so sorry, mate. I'm actually a skypey poll.
5634520	5637960	You're going to have to forgive me, but is there an enemy there?
5639240	5644840	No, that's a boss. Where's the enemy? That's actually really embarrassing.
5646200	5648920	Yeah, we don't know her last words because I'm a dumb dumb.
5648920	5652600	We're playing that. Hello. Are you okay? Are you squiddin' me right now?
5652600	5656520	Brian! I really like the second Avatar movie,
5656520	5661000	especially the scene where they destroy almost everything that was achieved in the first
5661960	5662520	True.
5664840	5671400	Okay, Iron Reaper, thank you for the tip. I'll admit, true. However, I present to you
5672120	5677480	Sigourney Weaver's second storyline, and that's fine with me.
5677480	5680360	I like that she's connected to Pandora, can control Pandora.
5680360	5683560	Okay, to Awa, and Awa grants her those abilities.
5683960	5690920	I don't think she's doing well. Are you going to expire after we finish talking?
5690920	5699880	Because I can't translate your last words to tell your to tell your family.
5704200	5709560	Oh, um, maybe you should expire because that's actually really great.
5710520	5713480	That's really rude. Please don't do that.
5725320	5734760	I need to claim. Please perish. Oh, my bow and arrow is not strong anymore whatsoever.
5734760	5739800	I used to one shot these guys. It's now costing two ammo.
5745000	5749800	Right, so what we have to do is just climb up these and then jump aboard when it comes
5749800	5758600	background, and then we destroy its receiving signal thing, which completely, um, okay, yeah.
5759160	5763080	Do you remember when we played Elden Ring and there is that chariot thing and you had to
5763080	5771640	drop down on top of it? Basically that. We just need to slowly wait for it to turn.
5771640	5778680	Yep, okay. And then when we get close enough, we just jump down.
5781800	5785560	Wait, can I not just, can I not shoot that with bow and arrow?
5787400	5791720	I feel like with their height difference, I could probably bow and arrow that.
5793800	5795400	Uh-huh.
5797400	5800600	Nope. Can't believe Elden Ring stole that idea literally.
5804600	5809720	Uh, right. I think that's just showing, I need to go up on this one.
5809720	5813080	What do you go up on this one? I can see it on the mini map that I'm covering up with my big
5813080	5816280	hair, but the mini map, I wish I could put the mini map in the other corner.
5817640	5819640	I'm always covering up the mini map when I play games.
5819800	5825480	Uh-huh. Hopefully doesn't bother you guys. I assume it's coming around this corner very slowly.
5826600	5827720	Something's trying to shoot up.
5831160	5833480	Are you coming? Hello?
5836280	5841240	Is it stuck? Am I out of its distance to move? Right, you, I can hear you shooting.
5842280	5848840	Knock it off. Stop moving. Oh look, the picture plant. Look, it's sending flies out to hurt him.
5849480	5854440	Death by flies. Death by flies. Oh, he's in. Did he come? I didn't know they could use,
5854440	5858040	no, come back. You need to perish by flies or by bow and arrow. Pick.
5861000	5869000	Fane. Okay, I'm out of the distance. Right, is this not, is it stuck? Why would it be stuck?
5871560	5874040	Oh, fane. I think we're maybe too early.
5875480	5878040	Watch it start moving when I come around this corner.
5879640	5885960	Yeah, I was kind of joking. I was actually joking, but I seriously did it. I knew that.
5885960	5888200	Where's the freaking bane? Where's the bane?
5900120	5902760	Moving again because I'm out of your render distance.
5902760	5910280	I am being pranked. I am being pranked. Wait, did it move?
5912760	5918840	Wait, that is it there. That's it right there. The render distance is broke.
5920680	5927160	Bro, it's going to start moving. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me get up the dang thing.
5927320	5936520	Oh, that's literally the only song I know off by heart. It's actually really sad.
5937960	5946040	There is an anime called Avatar the Last Airbender and Uncle Iroh is an absolute beloved character
5946040	5952760	and he sang a really moving song. It's literally the only song I know off the top of my head.
5953720	5958440	But it's like beautiful sad, not like hopefully not too sad sad, you know?
5961320	5966600	I need to not bring that song up anywhere close to making here. We can not allow it to spoiler.
5966600	5972200	Has Emi not seen it? Please stop it. I'm going to cry. Okay, okay, okay. We pause. We pause.
5973400	5980520	I didn't realize there were bad guys here. Take this and this. Why am I taking so much damage?
5980600	5985000	I don't know. Have I unlocked a new outfit? No, I haven't.
5986120	5990840	Wait, do you see that stat increase though? So as we unlock new outfits, it's going to go up so much.
5992040	5996440	You mean you don't? I don't know Secret Tunnel off by heart. Secret Tunnel. What am I supposed to do?
5998840	6002120	I'm supposed to do something. Hold on. Ah, I see the blossoms.
6002120	6014840	Two lovers forbidden from one another. There's a mountain in the way.
6024040	6026360	And I kind of forget how this next part goes.
6027320	6030280	Secret Tunnel. Brian, I'm singing.
6034280	6040120	Emi's planning on doing it. So she's definitely support emu's when she does that. Definitely.
6040920	6042120	Thank you for the tip, Nero.
6049080	6054760	I kind of forgot how this next part goes. Can you guys put the lyrics in chat and then I'll like
6054760	6060040	sing it to you guys. Shawnee, why have all the Scottish people met? Also nice.
6061800	6065720	Why are Scottish people nice? Oh, we're just, we're just vibing.
6065720	6071240	Scotland, Glasgow's been rated one of the nicest. Oh, we've got level up. We've got level up in our
6071240	6078440	healing and our sprint. So are we like even faster? Oh, wow. Okay. Okay. That was a pretty
6078440	6083640	decent distance. Are you actually a blue guy in this game or are you a skin walker like the movie?
6084120	6091560	We have, our human body has died. It got annihilated via missiles. So yeah,
6091560	6097400	we're like, we're Navi now. We're just trying to get accepted by the Navi and to reverse the
6097400	6109720	horrific effects that I'm actually not very skilled at this bit. Oh, jeez, Louise. Oh my god,
6109720	6114440	they like ate my health up so quickly. So this is what I mean by you get a second chance.
6115320	6124200	I now have four second chances. Oh my goodness. Get right. He's perished. Oh my gosh, that was
6125400	6133320	right. He's off of it. I don't know if I need to like unironically XP grind or something.
6134200	6145400	I feel like I die. I think I'm okay. Where are we? Where are we? Oh my gosh.
6147720	6153240	I don't remember the game being so hard. Do you know that? I'm just getting over here like,
6153240	6157560	bro, I'm out. You don't need to worry about me. I'm gone. I'm in and out like a flash.
6157560	6166520	Call me you same boat. I'm gone. 10 seconds. No, not leaves from the vein. The other one,
6166520	6173800	the happier one, the two lovers one, not leaves from there. That's a sad one. Scots are nice until
6173800	6184520	you tear us off. Honestly. Oh my god. Yeah, I'm trying not me to. We don't want to be sad up in
6184520	6196920	here. Good times. Good vibes. Two lovers forbidden from one another and the moon ends in the way.
6196920	6202280	I have no idea what it is. Stroney, you just channeled some intense dark souls energy by spam
6202280	6207160	rolling away from the attackers. Honestly, though, I should probably pick up cell samples
6207160	6213000	because I ended up using two revives for that. I definitely need an armor upgrade,
6213960	6225880	because. Okay, ready to lovers forbidden from one another award their people
6227320	6238200	and a man and evades them apart. You must build a path to be together.
6239160	6246760	And I kind of forgotten how the rest of it goes, but secret tunnel, secret tunnel.
6249560	6258600	It's such a good song. There we go. A little sing song for you. A little karaoke before the
6258600	6266680	actual karaoke stream is planned. Have a look. I've got to stop. That will get stuck
6267400	6273000	in my head for months. Oh, do you want the Scottish version of it? So it's extra cursed.
6274200	6277880	Wait, someone refit the lyrics in again, and I'll do the Scottish version for you,
6277880	6284600	because I'm just so kind like that. Okay, so the one thing about close combat is the instant.
6285560	6290360	I said the instant die. Thank you. Right, Scottish version.
6290360	6297240	If someone puts the lyrics in chat for me, just so I can go. My brain's a little slow.
6299560	6312120	Two lovers forbidden from one another award evades their people and a man and Brian,
6312120	6315720	you're interrupting my singing, Brian. Well, I'm getting absolutely.
6315720	6319800	Award divides their people. All right. Oh, sugar. Thank you for the tip.
6321480	6325960	I'm getting too distracted. I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes.
6329720	6333480	Thank you for tipping that. You didn't have to tip that. Thank you. I do appreciate anyway.
6334040	6338840	Right, right. Scottish version. Two. Wait, should I do really neasily, Scots?
6338840	6353320	Two lovers forbidden from one another award evades their people and a mountain divides them apart
6355320	6364520	and build a path a be together. Yeah, and I forget who the next couple of lines go,
6364520	6377480	but then it goes. Secret tunnel. Secret tunnel through the mountain. Secret, secret, secret,
6377480	6381640	secret tunnel. I think I need to go and visit for this next section.
6383480	6388280	Anyway, that's the Scots rendition. You're welcome for that on the house. Didn't even have to pick.
6388280	6397560	Why Bonaro? Why? I'll go invisible if I'm going to end up perishing, I think. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
6397560	6404280	whoa, whoa. Okay. These turrets on the wall are my biggest enemies. Got a lot of enemies and it's
6404280	6409400	the turrets on the wall, not the actual thing. Strana, just had any idea for your outfit. What
6409400	6416040	about a version with all of your modesty plasters are replaced by nicotine patches, honestly?
6419000	6424680	What is going on? I don't, sorry, I really don't remember this section, so I don't know what I'm
6424680	6430680	up against, but I'm just going to take it slow. Not knowing we're taking it a bit slow. I'm just
6430680	6436200	a bit, I can see something over there. Oh, he's destroying the car. I see empty mechas.
6437160	6445560	What's that up there? Can I destroy these for XP? Hold on.
6450200	6456680	Oh, wow. Oh, I'm doing a task sector destroying empty mech. Oh, wow, they explode as well. That's
6456680	6462200	actually really good to know that they explode. Okay, there we go. I press X to do that, ultimate.
6463160	6468840	Strana, do I smoke? No, I just talk too long and my voice is fried. Do you need help with this?
6468840	6472760	You want to gang violence this car because you're like taking your sweet time. That's going to blow
6472760	6479320	up, bro. That's going to blow up. Oh, it didn't hurt him though. Oh, I get a lot of XP for doing
6479320	6485880	that. I don't know if we need to farm yet. If we get too weak, we'll farm, but at the moment we are
6485880	6491400	above the thingy. Watch out. I know what challenge to destroy something.
6496680	6503720	This looks very battle, don't ask, but I don't recall. I just heard an Ikram. I think that was an
6503720	6509080	Ikram. Is this the person we need to find? Because I don't think he's looking too good.
6509080	6512440	Are you okay? Yeah, you need, you need, oh, he needs some milk.
6517240	6519800	Right, I'm sorry. It was too obvious, right? That's how you get wrecked.
6522920	6527080	Don't want to get hit that much, but it's literally the best I can do. All things considered.
6527080	6532440	Okay, that special attack knocks them over. That's really good to know. Okay.
6534200	6537400	Heal, heal, heal, heal. Okay, that bought me time, that bought me time, that bought me time.
6538360	6542680	Okay, two out of three. Wait, that didn't damage me? That explosion didn't damage me.
6543800	6549000	Okay, let's go. Okay, okay, that wasn't that bad. I thought that was going to be like
6549000	6556840	insane battle door mask type stuff, but we're safe. Strony's inky milk. Strony's inks milky. Hold
6556840	6563960	on a minute. Someone, someone described my homemade yogurt as glippy. I have not forgiven
6564040	6569160	you for such descriptions since. Is there an enemy over here? Whoa.
6575720	6582360	The fricking, the, wait, how much do I have to redo? Because I was like deep in that. Okay,
6582360	6589640	I don't have to redo much. The plane took me away with it. I bumped away, man. I bumped away,
6589960	6596360	bro. As far as I'm aware, this game has infinite lives. I probably would never have finished it
6596360	6604360	if I didn't because, you know, I didn't make it. Glippy. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6604360	6610920	I didn't, that is so cheating. They have, they had pre-spawned in. Go away. You can shoot me through
6610920	6614680	that because I can't shoot you. I'm going to have to be in viz to claim up this. Oh my gosh.
6614680	6620440	Where did, where did they go? Right. I need to...
6624120	6630040	Oh, lovely. Okay, there we go. Yeah, I'm not one shot nothing.
6631880	6640280	Just so the screen isn't too red. There. Jeez, Louise. Oh, I almost didn't make that. Can I
6640280	6644520	destroy this? Oh, I can. Take that. I didn't get any XP for that. So
6646920	6651400	that's great. Something. Honestly. Oh, my Icaran's here. I thought my Icaran was going to come and
6651400	6655160	get me. Okay, it's because it's exploding. My Icaran is coming to get me.
6655160	6671240	Okay, let's see what we're working with. Whoa. I don't like that.
6676600	6680440	I messed up. I'm sorry. I even brought attention to my existence.
6681400	6687000	Please, please, please. I'm just a Navi. I'm just a, I'm just a sweet innocent Navi.
6687000	6692760	I'm sorry. I tried to pick on you, Mr. Car. I'm sorry. My goodness. That Warthog is powerful.
6694200	6704440	Oh my goodness. It was just a little arrow. My gosh. And let me up. Literally light them up. I
6704440	6713160	want that thing up. Blast it out of the sky. Oh my goodness. That was not good. Right. You're
6713160	6719480	standing up now. So you feel a bit better. Good. Oh, a great warrior. Oh, you were hating on me
6719480	6725080	about 20 minutes ago. Hmm. Don't think I, I didn't forget. You're, you're a little hatey.
6727240	6733400	Okay. Goodbye. Oh, I'm called Dreamwalker now. I'm no longer a sky people. I'm a dream.
6735240	6740520	So let me shoot an arrow at this armed vehicle. Look, I have some good ideas and I have some
6740520	6751080	bad ideas. That was a bad idea. Oh, oh, there's, what the heck is this? What did I do with that?
6752120	6754200	Oh, we got an unlock. What did we get?
6756760	6763640	I'll look up. Invis for longer. Oh, we've got a bow and arrow upgrade and a weapon upgrade. Oh,
6763640	6768280	look, her bow has changed. Look, it's a different design now. See, that literally
6768280	6771560	is such a cross game. Right. What am I supposed to do with these crystals? Excuse me.
6775720	6781880	I'm actually, here we go. I guess I'm to follow the crystals because it's doing the little light.
6781880	6790600	So, okay. It's to follow it. I was, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. We're safe.
6791080	6796360	My goodness. I don't know what I need in order to survive other than an armor upgrade,
6796360	6801160	but those warthogs are so unforgiving. I was a mecha as I've unlocked now.
6801160	6804520	See, we're starting to get out of the tutorial where the game does not forgive.
6805800	6809880	Like the game will annihilate you if you don't like level up and stuff.
6809880	6813720	Oh, my horse is getting really shot out there. I didn't like that. I didn't enjoy that.
6814680	6818600	More enemies. It's impassable.
6821720	6829640	Oh, for God's sake. No, Mr. Horsey. Please do not. Wait. Gang violence. Gang violence. The horses.
6829640	6835720	Oh, no, my horse. Oh, my horse just perished, but I saw him attack on the leaf. That's two games
6835720	6842120	where the horse actually helps you. Okay. We're just going to have to take the rest on foot, sadly.
6843000	6850840	Oh, oh, do they attack me if I'm Navi? I feel like. Oh, oh, it's so beautiful.
6854280	6859560	Yeah, I really don't want them to attack me. I'm definitely picking up.
6860040	6863160	Rider, come in. I've only got a few seconds to talk.
6863160	6868200	Falco's gathering harmonics to find something called a well of souls. Well of souls.
6869080	6874520	You don't say. Falco's planning to use it to wipe out the Navi. I'll try to find out more.
6876680	6882200	I was hoping they didn't attack. I was hoping they didn't attack. Oh, I've gone the wrong way.
6882200	6886200	I'm getting too distracted. Oh, I don't want to hurt the whale blade. It just sucks.
6887080	6892440	Wait a minute. What did she call me? Raider? I hardly even know her.
6897000	6901480	Oh, you didn't. You didn't like that one? I guess. Yeah, I guess I repeated it. I'm sorry.
6904680	6908200	Yeah. Okay. I won't recycle jokes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
6909000	6913800	Is that? Oh, I can't see.
6916680	6918600	Okay, I'm sorry, but you guys are going to have to go.
6920920	6924360	I really wish they wouldn't attack. Oh, hello. Are you the person I need?
6925800	6933720	Man who is not man, a Navi who is not Navi. You are a puzzle, piece of Ewa's puzzle.
6933800	6937240	Oh, okay. I'm dreamwalking. Are we got an upgrade?
6943800	6948040	I thought no scrawny stream today. Are you sure about that?
6949560	6955320	She be a reminder. Okay. For those of you who are listening in are a part of the hair M.
6955960	6960600	She be cotton bum is going live in T minus.
6961560	6964040	Four minutes. She may actually be on the loading screen.
6966920	6972840	Eh, but yes. If there's any new YouTube mods lurking, you are welcome to speak,
6973640	6976680	but then I remove your speaking privileges instantly.
6978600	6982760	Class of 09. What is Class of 09? Have you guys played that?
6983320	6986760	scrawny streams never end. The return all hail the endurance cut off is.
6987080	6991880	As I play the Navi part, I did it later as a human.
6993080	7000520	Wrong. I've literally never done the RDA save. We will take. Oh, look how beautiful this is.
7001400	7003720	Literally glowing in the dark is just stunning.
7005240	7009160	Oh, could you imagine it with graphics that are updated?
7009160	7013560	Like, I have no idea what's in the new avatar game. Maybe we should play it for the first
7013560	7020680	time together, but I think it is as beautiful as this. Right. Why am I here? Oh, to get these crystals.
7022600	7025240	Okay, we're just going to ignore.
7029880	7034760	Because if we can just run in and out of these sections, if you hang around and kill anything,
7034760	7043080	yes, you will get faster XP. Oh, I don't want my horse to die. I'm so sorry. Oh, Mr. Horsey,
7043160	7049480	please don't die. Oh, no. Oh, no. Come on. We need to get out of here. Like right now,
7049480	7054360	I don't want you to pass away. I want you to have a happy life and retire at your old age.
7055240	7061720	Okay. And wait, this horse here is getting attacked as well. I was beating up that mech.
7061720	7065480	I was going to actually take it so this one can live its little retirement out. But
7066600	7069720	oh, I don't know if we're going to make it if they've got flipping flamethrowers and I've
7069720	7076680	got the wrong way because again, all turned around. Oh, please live, little horsey, please live. Oh,
7076680	7080280	no, the horsey is not going to. Right, that's it. We're clearing this. We're clearing this out.
7080280	7083480	Leave my horse alone. Everything is so strong.
7087240	7094760	Who? Who? Who? You, perish. Gosh. I don't have anyone to take out my special one.
7094760	7099960	Right, I'm healing because we're going to end this. Wait, I actually came out in your avatar.
7099960	7105160	Yeah, there's a new one. Didn't check it out. Yeah. I'm going to take more samples because
7105160	7111400	I've actually only got three. Wait, how far away? It's a wee bit away. It's a wee bit away.
7112360	7119000	All right, we are going to pick up cell samples just. No, my horse was still going to retirement.
7119960	7125320	You're so mean. Ow. Did that plant just smack me back?
7126200	7132840	Fine. My horse is already passed away. Man, he had a pension fund and everything.
7134120	7137480	Imagine working your whole life. Actually, I read a story about like that
7138120	7141560	where someone like worked their whole life and they got one week of retirement and passed away
7141560	7147720	and it was like, I would, I would be so mad. I would be so mad. I would explain to death himself
7147720	7154920	like, look, mate, I've kind of sweat my whole life. Dread Brian. By the way, I'm not sure if it was you
7154920	7160840	who asked, but it was someone invalid asked if the Black Ops two servers were fixed. Me. The answer
7160840	7167880	is yes, the servers were fixed, but bear in mind, it's still the Black Ops two servers. If you know
7167880	7177560	you know. I remember the game couldn't be played by streamers on the basis of like a super easy
7177560	7186520	to get like your IP going. But if they fixed it, honestly, Black Ops with the boys. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7189080	7194120	Have a little drink. Have a sipping tin. Thank you very much for the tip. Tarja, I appreciate that.
7194600	7200680	Yeah. Shawnee, the horse is only looking for three days anyway. Well, in Pandora, I'm going to hang
7200680	7205880	with sheep now. Yes, have fun with sheepsters. She's live with Class of O'Nane, which I actually
7205880	7212200	don't know what the good is about. Imagine had reals ifs that basically happened to. Oh, I'm sorry.
7213400	7219720	But yeah. Oh, we must draw harmonic from tree.
7219720	7230200	Oh, I think I know where this is going to go.
7230200	7246520	Oh, okay, that line delivery was a bit. No, long glory. No, we fling.
7251000	7257000	I will say one thing for the VAs of this game, especially for older games in the past,
7257960	7263080	odds are they had no idea what the scene actually had and they were just given a script and just said
7263880	7267960	like they don't know the depth of the script or what occurred. It was only until like recent
7267960	7274840	stuff like where actors can see live what they're performing. So follow the sound of vibrations
7274840	7276600	and find tuning points.
7285640	7289800	Okay, if there's three, it's probably going to be like identical. Yeah, okay.
7291400	7294760	Wait, hold on. Yeah, okay. And then the last one's going to be like right here
7295640	7301880	because of the way triangles work. Yeah, I love triangles. What's your yeah, yeah,
7301880	7307640	you know what? Favorite shape. I'm going to give it in our rectangle triangle or rectangle for favorite
7307640	7313000	shape. Oh, it's singing to me. Hold on. I feel like something mystical is about to happen.
7313000	7323800	I'm actually getting a bit scared. I just checked. Oh, no.
7324040	7332440	We must take this home back to home tree. It's a wooden delivery. Get it because of the trees.
7333480	7335480	It was a wooden delivery.
7338840	7346120	Oh, I came up with that myself came up with that comment myself. I'm so witty as a streamer,
7346120	7353400	aren't I? I'm just going to start stealing your guys's like witty comments and then doing that over
7353800	7361560	Oh, I have a new armor. New armor. Oh my god, girl game, girl game. Oh yeah, like the protection.
7362200	7369800	What is vitality? More health. I have more health overall because of the armor. Yeah,
7369800	7375560	well, you can see where they added more armor onto me. You have solved content creation.
7376520	7385960	Oh, that's proper harmonized. Yeah, good luck hitting them.
7387960	7394520	Armor barely covers anything. And honestly, like they are using right. We're going to home tree.
7394520	7395800	Wait, we're going back to home tree.
7398200	7400840	What? I'm about to report to them that. Oh, by the way, longer these dead.
7401560	7409560	I'm going to cry from that joke literally what cry of pain or just like just like how ridiculous
7409560	7417480	it was. Okay, we are going to be polite to Ewa and respect the home tree by not doing backflips
7417480	7424440	all the way up the trunk of the tree. Okay. Oh my god, it's tree balls. We love tree balls.
7425320	7427240	Let's just get very bright in here. I'm not going to lie.
7428600	7432440	Do I need to recalibrate? Hold on. I'm like a professional streamer. I think I need to recalibrate
7432440	7441320	my muscles. Okay, there we go. Recalibrating, meet your virtual, recalibrate it. Oh, yeah.
7443480	7449880	Sorry. Oh, we did actually report longer is passing. Okay.
7450840	7454520	You have the song. No, no, how but yeah, I scored the
7457160	7461080	not the thumbs up. That was so human of you. Please don't do that again.
7465960	7468920	A little tap on the shoulder. Sing.
7472200	7475880	What am I saying? Am I actually to say is this like a mini game where any like
7479880	7482920	what on earth is this freaky stuff going on here?
7488120	7492920	I don't even remember that at all. Thumbs up. Let's just try to come there.
7493800	7497560	It is the first step in our path. How many steps we got?
7498760	7507000	Find location is one step. Okay. Speaking to Ewa is another. Okay. This demands the need of a
7507960	7514760	the first voice. Only the first voice awakens well of souls. So this is campaign mode getting
7514760	7521000	explained to us. I totally know the plot inside out from this game. Yeah.
7522680	7524600	Assassin's Creed. I know the plot of this.
7528440	7531800	All I know is that we're doing good for the planet. Easy on the mumbo-jumbo stuff.
7531800	7534280	No, please, even if not directed at me, they hurt anyway.
7537960	7542280	What if the trees wanted to see a sick backflip?
7545560	7553080	Mission complete. Mission complete. Oh, not to jump around. Jump up. Can I put my weapons away?
7553080	7557720	I feel like having weapons out in this location isn't very pleasant. No, put the RDA gun on me.
7561160	7565960	Why is this so bright? I don't ever... Oh my god. I don't ever recall that issue.
7567320	7573720	Hmm. Oh, hello again. I would like to talk to you for my next mission.
7573720	7576280	We go to Toroknari. Toroknari.
7577720	7582920	I hear the human Thalco seeks your death. We will not let this happen.
7582920	7586600	You know, spending five years in cryo. Thank you, Tenjala.
7587480	7592040	War is new to this world. It must not happen again. Never on the enemy side.
7592120	7594520	But we're the goodies, so they're the enemy.
7597080	7605640	We're healing nature. We're healing nature. Mother nature always reclaims all. Mother,
7605640	7614600	mother, mother, mother nature. Oh, this looks like a dark room out. Beautiful.
7614840	7621240	Toph is the Marvel boy? I can't really do later voices like Toph.
7622200	7629640	Oh, Katana. Look, there's the castle. That's what I would say if I could see
7630760	7634680	something. If I wasn't blind. I can't really hear a voice at all.
7637880	7642280	Is it a castle? There's something in the sand or the library? There's the library.
7644600	7648120	Katana. Oh, sorry. It's not Katana. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
7651560	7653720	It's upside down, isn't it?
7656920	7663400	Katana? Close enough. I know. I know. Katana wins. Good luck, Tenjala. Good luck, Tenjala.
7663400	7667080	All right. Good luck, Tenjala. Hi. Oh, who's this? Hello. How do you do?
7667080	7671480	You come for shards. That must wait. Oh, I need a pause on the shards.
7671560	7672520	Post-trump on the shards.
7677640	7680760	A little cheeky hydration check. A little cheeky hydration.
7685480	7690680	There's the library. That's the way it would sound like the phone about the body.
7690680	7701800	Longer speak. Oh, okay. I'm going to say something controversial.
7702520	7710120	You know when maps are straight ahead like this? Yeah? I like that. I appreciate when games don't
7710120	7717480	make you go back and forth and you just keep going forward. When a game makes you turn around
7717480	7720760	to go do something on the map that you previously had that area.
7725960	7730600	However, when a game makes it nice and linear,
7733160	7736920	not going to lie, I almost fell off there. Oh, and I can't actually see where I'm supposed to go.
7736920	7743720	Thanks to this leaf. Oh, here we go. Backtrack. Hey, yeah, backtracking a bit.
7743720	7753560	Okay, let's see how it goes. Okay, so if you take the high ground,
7754840	7760200	wait, look, that's why they attack me. They've got backpacks on the wolves and that's why they
7760200	7768280	attack me. The RDA put like main control devices on the wolves and now they want to attack me even
7768280	7776280	though I'm Navi. I'm Navi and I'm navigating. What the heck am I doing here? Am I destroying stuff?
7778360	7779800	Don't have to ask me twice.
7782120	7788120	What am I doing? Challenge complete, right? I'm going to do it from up here. Oh, I see.
7789080	7799320	So I'm releasing the native Navi and destroying them. Jesus. Why? Yeah, we're like literally
7799320	7807560	so low level. We're not even one shotting. Can I break you? Oh, I can't.
7811080	7817160	I like how he just don't. Oh, he like dives over. I mean, honestly, if an arrow struck me,
7817640	7823800	probably. Oh, we did it. Like Ori in the blank forest.
7826200	7833960	I true. Wait, wait, wait. What am I supposed to do with that? Destroy it? I'm just going to pump.
7833960	7838600	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me pump all the ammo into it. Where's my gun? I can't.
7839240	7849800	Yeah, your height, you're teasing me. I'm not even hitting you, bro. You're literally right under
7849800	7855880	the tree. I'm going to have to go. No, stop shooting me. I need to destroy this.
7856280	7870920	Hello. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Oh, no. Game. Game.
7874280	7880440	Did I need to hit the other side of it, I guess? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
7881240	7883560	whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
7883560	7891160	Okay, done. Jeez, Louise. They are killing us here. That was very strange, but we did it.
7891160	7896920	That's the main thing. Right here. We should not. Are you trying to shoot that guy and you're missing
7896920	7902680	like horribly? Oh, you are. Oh, and I'm missing horribly too. You know that both of us are as
7902680	7912360	bad as each other. He healed as I, bro, come on. Hello, would you like to talk to me?
7914840	7916200	Oh, I'll just keep talking.
7921880	7929000	Backtracking works if the map is good. Yes, I would argue yes. I did try and play Ori in the
7929000	7937400	blind forest, but I was just too paid to pay go. It's definitely not a stream game for me, but one
7937400	7944440	of the other girls most likely would play it. I feel like it's a, I definitely chill stream, chill
7944440	7949960	stream. Yeah. This is actually a really beautiful map because you get to run along the little tree
7949960	7953320	roots, which I really like. Yay, nature. Nature wins again.
7956280	7963880	Uh, right. I can see, and we're maybe fighting here or are we,
7966760	7972360	huh, are we just running through this? Oh, wow. We actually did pretty decent damage.
7973400	7977800	Yeah. Wow. I'll take that. I don't, I don't, I think that was just a payable drill haul.
7980040	7987240	Super. Are they cute? I can only, I'm okay. Hold on. I, it doesn't seem like an objective area
7987240	7993160	because of that reason. I'm just going to do this. I know I shouldn't. I know I should probably like
7993160	7997160	level up a bit, but I am very happy just to keep walking on the tree trunks.
7997880	8003000	You want a non chill stream? Place a list. I've seen a lot of streamers place a list. Like,
8003080	8009720	it's interesting to see what like, um, oh, I'm in trouble. Uh, oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, I'm in trouble.
8011800	8017000	Oh my goodness. I do not remember being in so much trouble playing this game.
8017560	8022040	What's the way? I think it's maybe I used to farm areas to level up and I was just so OP
8022600	8027320	because I think this map, we're actually supposed to be unlocking a green
8028280	8031560	armor right now, but I ain't doing it.
8032520	8037720	Apologize dude. Just doing some backflip, literally backflip dodge and bullets.
8037720	8041960	Right. We're getting ready to attack these guys, but I need to actually activate the quest by
8041960	8047240	talking to this guy before we attack and release more of Pandora's. Me?
8048440	8054760	How can I help? You would not like my answer. Listen, like it or not, you've got my help on this one.
8055480	8059400	String. The tattooed lord of sky machines with weapons.
8060920	8064840	Was it, I think for anyone who did actually watch the first Avatar movie,
8064840	8069640	I think scum means like idiot or something like that. Like scum. You have to go like scum.
8069640	8070680	Or else you're not saying it right.
8077160	8081800	Yeah, I feel like I replayed and leveled up a lot more as a child and right now we're just like
8081800	8085160	speedrunning through this. Although when you do complete a mission, you do get like a nice
8085160	8092200	chunk of XP. So speaking of leveling up, I have a six minute timer at the top of the screen.
8095160	8100840	That looks like a protection spell that I am putting on. I didn't realize I unlocked some
8100840	8105880	sort of protection thing. I definitely want to put whatever that is. Greatly reduces. Yeah,
8105880	8112360	okay. Yeah, we'll definitely be utilizing that right woman to do. Right, let's test this out.
8114760	8119320	I'm about to destroy the ship. Jump up here.
8122840	8129960	Hello. Oh wait, I can just, yeah. Is this what I'm supposed to destroy?
8130520	8137240	Oh yeah, okay, it is. Oh yeah, take that. You like that? Yeah, you're like a big adult. Oh,
8137240	8141000	am I going to get a blood raid because it's facing me now? I'm getting, I'm getting shaky,
8141000	8147480	I'm getting scared. Okay, we're fine, we're fine. Like honestly, smooth sailing. Okay,
8147480	8152680	the NPCs aren't really locking onto me too well because of the distance. But we're making it,
8152680	8157640	we're making it. They're getting a bit closer, so we might have to actually start shooting them
8158200	8163960	a wee bit, just a wee bit. Oh, that was a good shot there. One more, and then that's three of four.
8165240	8171160	You're telling me that quad aerial thing can stay up with three? I don't believe it.
8172280	8180840	One more, two more. I'm not hitting that at all. It's not registering. I'm just going to spam it
8181640	8182600	in. Am I supposed to go up?
8185560	8190840	Of course, the thing I want is like not facing me. Is this one in the corner?
8192520	8195320	Okay, there we go. Hey, wait, wait, I just, I'm looking at it.
8198280	8206360	Sound like a human iron birdie, I'm just saying. Literally. The steel a crann is no match for me.
8206360	8212040	I'm going to loot this stuff. I've got three revives. Oh my gosh.
8214360	8220120	Oh, the poor babies, they're not even attacking us. Out you come, baby. Wait, so, okay, it looks like
8220120	8232680	regular ones don't attack me anymore. Hello? Yes. I think we're going to raid him.
8236680	8244680	Oh, they're so cute. We're helping the little forest critters.
8247960	8251560	What do you need? I'm sorry, medications for the big guy.
8253000	8258040	Oh, just basic flowers. That's fine. I can get that. That's no problem. Hold on. Hold that thought,
8258120	8265720	little guy. I'm coming back. And then I think we get to ride him into battle like a horse,
8265720	8272520	but it's not a horse. I think it's called a Thanator. If I remember correctly. Oh my goodness.
8272520	8275640	I remember that time I said in this map, you don't have to backtrack.
8277720	8282360	Honestly, it's not that bad though, because it's to help an animal. And, you know, we
8283080	8287160	shadow wizard money gang. We love healing nature from these parts.
8289800	8298520	I'm going in. Oh, I'm getting sprayed and prayed, but they can't get me. I'm too good.
8301080	8307640	Gather plants from the banshee's nest. Oh, that's what that is. I suppose we'd be comfortable with
8307640	8316760	that. Pandora is Ohio, but more natural. You're not allowed to speak for the next 20 seconds.
8316760	8321000	Do you understand me? Don't say that again.
8328040	8333240	I'm so excited for your ace mushroom. I just want new earbuds for it. I hope it's not a
8333240	8339160	disappointment. I most likely will not do ear licking. I'm just going to say that now before
8339160	8344920	anyone gets thingied. I have no idea what an earth is going on with YouTube and ear licking at the
8344920	8352120	moment. Something, there's either a policy update being pushed or something, but for some reason anime
8352120	8359640	ear licks bad. In real life, human person ear licks fine. So I don't want you to be disciplined.
8359640	8364360	I have put a lot of thought and effort into it, so hopefully the Acemari is good. I don't know how
8364360	8369080	long I'm going to stream for. And the problem is I get really distracted when I constantly
8369080	8373480	read your guys' stuff because you guys make me laugh all the time. So I'm not really sure how
8373480	8380440	official an Acemari is going to be. I'll probably try hard for like 15 minutes and then it's just
8380520	8389480	going to... Oh, that's so cool. Has Ava gone mad? No, Ava has blisters.
8391800	8398840	Whiskers, honestly though. We whiskers. It's impossible because YouTube can't tell the difference.
8399640	8407320	That's my theory at the moment is that anime is getting... because YouTube are saying it's implied
8407320	8413080	else. Whereas we all know what actual ear licking sounds like because it's literally a 3D microphone.
8414280	8426280	So it's really put in a bit of a hindrance on my plans. Oh my gosh. Is this not the coolest ride
8426280	8434680	you've ever seen? Oh my god, it's so cool. Oh, he leaves. Can he go faster? Oh, he attacks.
8435480	8441880	Oh, that's so cool. Can he jump? Oh no, that's not jump. Oh wait, wait. Do I move as it moves?
8441880	8452440	Oh, oh man. Can you jump? Oh, I love him. He's so slick looking. Like genuinely so slick.
8453880	8460680	Not a hair on him. How do you keep warm? I'm fine. Like almost. Laughing was the highlight you'll be
8460680	8469240	fine. Come on, buddy. Come on, whiskers. Let's get him. Wait, am I going back? Oh, I'm just going back
8469240	8474040	to talk. It's just like, literally, it looks like he's been dropped in tar or the perv thing,
8474040	8478040	but it's just how he is. A little hairless thing. I don't like hearing this kind of stuff.
8483080	8487160	Okay. Why?
8487800	8493800	Do not speak like you understand. Why is she so informal when talking to this guy?
8494600	8499560	You have to pick your battles, B. This guy is speaking a second language. At least try and
8499560	8503960	speak clear English, you know? So it's easier for him. Danny, go back before it's forward. Okay.
8503960	8509800	There we go. You ready, whiskers? Oh, I did not mean to do that, but that was absolutely horrifying.
8510600	8512200	Right. Come on, whiskers. Let's get him.
8518200	8522200	Hopefully you have a lot of health, whiskers, because I'm not doing any combat at all.
8524120	8533640	Ah, whiskers. Can you go across this stuff? You can. Oh, you're actually such a smart kitty,
8533640	8540440	honestly. You're a smart kitty. Okay. I auto-jump if it's quite a... Oh, there's a
8541080	8545560	two, please don't attack, question mark. I don't think they attack me anymore.
8547160	8553880	Speaking of contact, the enemy's got a lot of enemies. Okay. We're all good.
8553880	8558760	Whiskers made it into a happy attack. There's another whiz... How many whiskers are there out
8558840	8564360	there? There's so many of them again. Bingoes. Some mate like the...
8569880	8571480	What is going on in the background?
8575480	8582760	Uh, cutscene moment? Cutscene moment, hello? Cutscene moment, hello?
8582840	8586520	Oh, I think I'm stuck in it.
8594360	8597160	Just absolutely chaos in the background, by the way.
8602840	8608760	Endgame... Oh, and we've got to level up as well. Right, we need to help out that whiskers.
8609480	8614440	Right, hold on. Leave whiskers alone. What's going on here?
8616360	8619240	Stop it. Wait, what's going on?
8623080	8626520	Right, I'm just going to do melee for the sticks. It's just so easy and quick.
8627480	8639080	Why no health? Why no health? I'm doing my spell. Am I supposed to be on whiskers?
8639080	8643720	I think I'm supposed to be on whiskers. Tear them up, whiskers! Tear them up!
8644600	8647800	That's right. Who's a good kitty? You're going to get some treaties after this.
8648600	8656200	I'm just going to do whiskers for the crazy in the background, honestly.
8658760	8665000	Just a reminder that Sheevee Cottonbump is alive if you care to watch classes all night.
8670040	8675400	Oh, this is so cool. Oh no, my kitty's losing health. I can't heal him.
8677800	8682600	Oh, baby. I don't want you to perish. I want you to have happy retirement.
8685960	8690680	Oh, there's no way kitty's going to deal with these mechs without being perished.
8692040	8695400	Unless I put him away. Right, you stay there.
8699240	8704360	Oh, my goodness. And I don't have my protection spell yet.
8707960	8714600	I don't have protection spell. I'm literally... Oh, kitty, I might need you back. Kitty, I might need
8714600	8725560	you back. Kitty, where are you? Kitty, you're saving me, kitty. Yes, knock them over. Yes! Yes,
8725560	8731640	oh, you're so smart. You're so smart. You're so smart. Oh, you're such a good party party.
8732360	8736440	Right, I do need to heal in a moment, but I think we're doing all right. What's going on here?
8737080	8740840	You're... You've glitched out and you're not even fighting alongside me, so that's fine.
8745080	8749880	Oh, the kitty... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.
8750840	8758520	Oh, I've casted protection. I've casted protection. I did crash protection, but I was too late because
8758520	8764840	I healed first. I should have done it. Okay, okay, we can do that. This is super easy to get them.
8765800	8769800	Where are they? Where's all the ones? Where are they?
8771960	8779000	Two more? Oh, there you are. Okay, we're done. Oh, there's three more. I'm telling you, peppers.
8782600	8790200	Hopefully, the cat didn't die then. Okay. Actually, I'm gonna... Oh, wait, no, this is
8790840	8796520	okay. Right, okay. Yes, yes, yes, this turns to the corpus.
8800600	8803080	I cast skill issue, honestly.
8809080	8816040	Okay. Yes, we can do that. One more shard and then we do a song. A little song and dance.
8817000	8828120	Oh, I crammed. Oh, that is really rough. That was a rough landing with the animation on the
8828120	8835720	navi there. I have to admit, you're bending with the element there. Right, let's unlock the home
8835720	8841080	tree. No, not home tree. Tree of vision, which lets you teleport around the map. Yeah, it was
8841080	8847720	crunchy. That was crunchy. That was 2009 showing. I never know how long these bigger games take to
8847720	8854200	develop. I still think it's like three years development, two years development. This smallest
8854200	8859240	development game tank crunch I ever heard was Fallout New Vegas. That was like big like that.
8860360	8867640	I think they said it was 11 months development, which was crazy, all things considered.
8868360	8872840	Uh, I think we just walked the rest of the
8880040	8885320	Raider hardly even or anything else to brighten my day.
8886760	8888840	Okay, so I'll stop making that joke. I'm sorry.
8889000	8892600	It's a ticking time bomb. We can't let Fowler get anywhere near the well.
8895800	8897640	She's can't keep getting away with it.
8899560	8905720	Hey, am I supposed to find my Gornu? Are you feel health, kitty? Oh, you're not even
8905720	8910440	readable, actually. I'm not supposed to read them anymore. Yeah, I know. I know. Right. I won't do
8910440	8917080	it anymore. God, give it some bit. A 15 year old game. Look, look, look. They did actually come
8917400	8923880	some pretty decent games like back then. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, Brian. Last one for
8923880	8929400	today. I got to go night night. Good night. Thank you for the tip, Virginia. Good night,
8929400	8936600	and I'll see you in the morning. How long are you two hours in? So statistically we have like
8936600	8944440	four. Oh, no, no one's sleeping in four hours. I'm a nation must die. Do you wish to help us or
8944440	8950360	not? Yes, I'll help you, my goodness. Honestly, yeah, you actually do deserve a bit sass. Right,
8950360	8960360	we're okay. Yeah, just go ahead. Whoa. What am I supposed? What animal? Am I supposed to eliminate?
8962920	8967880	Oh, actual cutscene. Yeah, we do not get actual cutscenes like this often.
8968040	8980360	Oh. Oh, sorry, I'm petting my hair right now. My hair is up in a bun.
8983400	8985560	I'd rather that sounded rather old.
8988360	8993960	Two and a half. Stony, you get one more of those jokes for all your jokes become unfunny.
8993960	8999000	I don't have any more sound effects to do it with. I don't have any more sound effects.
9000120	9003720	That's them all. So I can't make the joke again. I've only got crickets now.
9009720	9014040	I really don't like hurting these guys, but if they're baddies, there's nothing I can really be.
9015320	9020760	I give you, I send you back to Awa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's a lot more of
9020760	9027240	you in this plane, this pen than I thought. Jeez. What am I supposed to destroy in here? That.
9032040	9039480	Uh, I hope this works. Uh, I cast protection. I cast protect- I re-
9043160	9047080	I'm stuck in the corner. I cast protection.
9047240	9055320	Okay, thank God this game is so buggy. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean to heal. I wasted that heal.
9057480	9063000	Oh, this is making me nervous. Haha, you can't come on the rock. You can't come on the rock.
9064520	9070200	Most games for older games, elevation really bugs out the AIs that they have. So don't be afraid to
9070200	9076840	use elevation to your advantage because then you get moments like this where you can just have
9076840	9083400	a good time because they can't get on the elevation. Okay, for you. Glad that's over because that is
9083400	9089960	really not an easy enemy to defeat in the world. My gaspan bug rug. Shawnee, you seem to have upgraded
9090760	9099000	upgrades available top left. Wait, actually though. No, I don't, I don't, unless it's that.
9099000	9101160	Greatly improved damage for a short amount of time.
9101320	9109960	Hmm. Yeah, like for some reason, if you don't like tab over these, it'll constantly tell you you have like weapon upgrades and stuff.
9112040	9119880	What else have I got? Yeah, so like things get more like stronger as we progress.
9121160	9124680	I could do a club, honestly. Let's see the club. What does it look like?
9125400	9134120	Oh, that's a meaty swing. Oh, that's a load up though to get that. That's quite a load up.
9135640	9143080	Oh, yeah, that it doesn't. Okay. No, this is for these guys. It's the double. It's the double for me.
9145240	9151000	Oh, why would you guys even be in a broken facility? Be honest, right now.
9154840	9157880	Oh, why? How are you even getting me through a fence?
9160200	9164680	Well, I need to aim. You need to reload. So which one of us is going to go down first?
9166040	9174440	Yeah, the club's too slow. I'm just gonna go for it. Okay. Yeah, one shot with the things I'll take.
9174440	9180120	Is there anyone else here? I hear him. I hear him. I can't see him. Oh, he's so tiny.
9180920	9185240	Oh, you're so tiny. I can't even see it. Ha, ha, ha. You're welcome.
9185960	9188840	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
9188840	9191560	Gang up, on, gang up, on. That's what I get for making a joke.
9194600	9195560	Spank, spank, spank.
9198760	9201640	Hello, scrawny. There was no notification for your human discord.
9203560	9209080	Discord hates me. I can't believe it. I'm not discord's little kitten or whatever. I said anything
9209080	9215380	that thing. Shibi is live right now with Classable 9 if that game is more of an
9215380	9218600	interest to you because I'm literally playing the most like unknown game ever.
9218600	9225160	I don't know if this game out on PlayStation and that as well. I don't
9225160	9233680	remember it being... oh there's a Thanator in here. Where is it? Oh I hear it. Where is it?
9234320	9238880	Oh it's literally right there. We'll just spray it down.
9243760	9248320	Oh I'm already out of ammo. Oh I thought I thought I thought I thought I was going to be like
9248960	9256080	coded. Oh okay now he's not coded to go any further. I was going to say I'm like I didn't
9256080	9262160	think it was coded to go any further. This is another thing about older games. You can like
9262240	9268560	just absolutely smurf them because there's only so much game memory and game storage that they
9268560	9274640	can allocate for areas which means coding wise they will just stop enemies from doing stuff like
9274640	9279760	that. I just love it. I appreciate it so much. Like it just makes everything nice and easy.
9279760	9285920	Peasy lemon squeezy. What you got to complain about? Huh? What you got to complain about?
9286560	9290640	I know the game did come out on PlayStation 3. Okay okay so it wasn't... I didn't think it was an
9290640	9298720	Xbox exclusive but I don't think it ever got released on Steam. What? I don't know. Hi it's
9298720	9305120	done. It's done. Hydration check. Your own people would not have you so you come to us.
9306000	9310960	I'm gaming. I'm not doing this for me. There's a lot more to cheese. I'm cheeseing it. I'm not smurfing
9310960	9317760	it. Cheeseing it. Do you think I enjoy this? How much do I need to play for that? I've never
9317760	9322720	done it. I've genuinely never done it. I don't think so you don't need to pay anything at all. I've
9322720	9332320	gone to an RDA. I assume the RDA is just like congrats you've destroyed the planet thanks
9332320	9341200	and then the credits just roll. That's how I imagine the RDA side ends. Are you proud of yourself
9341200	9350240	for beating a helpless NPC? Hold on I'm getting rolled. Oh my armor! I just noticed that my armor.
9350240	9355120	Oh my god girl moment. Oh my god fashion show. Fashion. I've got a passion. Whoa look at that
9355120	9360880	protection walk. Are you squidding me right now? Today I learned that if you click on the hashtag
9360880	9366240	smuttlefish hashtag in the stream description one of the first videos shown is the pufferfish
9366800	9372080	gagging on a character video. Truly perfect. Actually thank you for the tip. Sorry y'all.
9372080	9385600	Oh that poor little guy. But yeah fashion show momento. So human basic armor. A little bit
9385600	9391200	of an upgrade and then we've got like location based armor. I knew it so hopefully we can take
9391200	9405040	a wall open now because are we faster as well? Oh who's here? Oh why are you here? This is Navi.
9406240	9411440	I'm destroying Pandora just trying to input these guys. Let me put my glycs on. Can I see none?
9411680	9422160	I'm invisible. You shouldn't be shitting me anymore. I'm literally invisible.
9425600	9429920	Am I going to heal naturally or do I need a pulp to heal? I need a pulp to heal.
9433200	9440080	Take this. Oh I see the TNT thing. I'm going to grab the crystal before it gets me as I don't
9440160	9447840	go to craft. Get me out here. Get me out here. Get me out here. Oh that sprint is so good. Oh my
9447840	9454960	I just came out of nowhere. He blinked and he was gone. Oh need to pick up more samples. Oh get me
9454960	9459840	out of here. There's too much. If they start having like knock back that's when it gets dangerous
9459840	9464720	like being in the middle of the enemies. So do forgive me if I literally just blow past all these
9464720	9474640	sections. Oh I can do that. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Okay okay we're we're getting
9476880	9483040	so mo. Oh that's such a good thing. Ah see when they do that they stall you. That's when you get
9483040	9497680	this. Oh no no no. It's literally TNT in the sky. Okay we made it. We made it. Let me just
9497680	9506640	unlock this little tree of vision. You can't see me no. The vitality and protection boost.
9506720	9512000	Yeah. What about the corp? Did you find out why they're pulling out? Why are you pulling out?
9512000	9516080	Hmm. You don't want to pull out there?
9520880	9527040	Okay we've got our second song so does that mean we need to do a third song and then we're
9527520	9529360	who? Am I to talk to? The Banshee?
9532480	9532960	Teleport?
9535120	9536400	Wait what am I supposed to do?
9538800	9543200	It's on to happen. It says yellow on the map. Am I supposed to read the ikran?
9544400	9552720	No. I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention. The willow tree? The willow tree?
9553440	9559840	Am I to use this to teleport to here to get to home tree?
9563120	9563440	What?
9566400	9572160	Wait was there a thing back? No not conquest. No not conquest. No no no no. We don't want to do
9572160	9576480	conquest. You must do it at the end of the game. No no no. I already know how to play. Thank you. No
9577040	9582000	conquest. Not now. Was there something I was supposed to pick up back there? I feel like I
9582320	9593280	don't know. Child support scary. Is there a crystal? Oh dumb. Dumb dumb dumb dumb. Gee I wonder
9593280	9598320	if it's supposed to go here on this conveniently place little island thing. Okay I was gonna
9598320	9604960	I need something. Now what was the third one here? Yeah okay okay don't make it too don't make it too
9604960	9608240	obvious video game devs don't even need yellow paint in this game.
9612400	9618640	Okay we have the song. My apologies. I was rather confused there.
9622880	9632160	I'm becoming na-vi na-vi na-vi na-vi. You bring hope for the future. Give our call. We bring this song
9632160	9639440	before ta-i. The battle moves swiftly. I fear humans are a step ahead of us. We must return song to
9639840	9647120	home. Mercy's just DM'd me. Strongly my alt twitter's growing really fast. I'm scared
9649120	9651680	but under the tweet I'm getting nervous. Should I post this?
9653520	9665440	Yeah you can post what you want. I'm gonna reply. Mercy you can you can post what you like my darling
9666000	9670320	whether whoever makes you happy. Yeah I have replied to Mercy.
9674000	9679360	Farah Yandere she sure does love being like on ironic this is gonna sound really weird when I
9679360	9683120	say this out loud. She sure does love being a good girl and getting permission for everything
9683680	9692640	Farah Yandere. Like literally all of the girls are so fantastic. And so we're slowly getting
9692640	9698800	past the stage of do I need permission to do this? Because the answer is always no you do not
9698800	9705120	need my permission you're in control. So I was the same. The best kind of Yandere.
9710640	9717680	Yeah damn need some sunglasses to get up this tree. But yes the girls are definitely easing into
9717680	9723920	the concept that because I assume you know they've consumed enough kind of like oh most
9723920	9728160	future agencies like have this long list of rules that you have to abide by and it's like my rules
9728160	9738720	are like literally you know be cool with lollipop stuff and no no male collabs and you know that's
9738720	9742480	it. It gets really simple you do everything yourself I'm not going to tell you what to do I'm
9742720	9748640	going to dictate your content. So Brian. Yes you can post whatever you want my dear mercy
9748640	9755520	leaks classified military documents war thunder style. I know about that if you didn't know
9756240	9762720	military documents keep getting leaked in a video game because people are like they're like so
9762720	9766320	like wanting everything to be correct which is hilarious thank you for the tip Farah.
9767040	9775760	But that's like true real and true because what I'm sure one of them was like they were arguing
9775760	9782400	over a helicopter detailed design either in the cockpit or something to do with a helicopter
9783040	9789680	and then someone was like so Tismo they were like no you're wrong and here's why and then they just
9789680	9797200	like flop down these like documents that shouldn't be publicly accessible um and it's happened
9797200	9805680	with the law. Okay we're singing a second song I'm going to assume by the third song we will progress
9805680	9813120	to the next story part element is good good let me try a rumble nun will soon be found
9813120	9820080	okay it's a little weird daily so many stuff challenger tank manlet armor but it
9821280	9827360	in a Eurocopter shells etc it's happened 15 to 17 times
9831520	9836480	bro bro was like slams on desk see I told you so
9837200	9843680	now this gen is blessed truly guide you to your next like it wasn't even one country leaking
9843680	9849280	the info it was all of them together just so that the the equipment and tanks and all that were
9849280	9854000	accurate in game the next song there's literally a joke zero days since last military leak
9854960	9861040	she sees what you may become they don't like to be wrong exactly great honor I'm just someone
9861040	9865680	who gave me a song back home we call that a DJ oh he she just stroked his chest
9866400	9873760	didn't you worry mate I just collect the songs look beyond the cup that's already full
9874640	9877200	og san says as he drinks it means
9878960	9887120	uh they are a Ramu a certain dominance honestly actually leaks really five and seven but other
9887120	9894560	times they were export uh restricted but it could be found online I'm really proud to belong to the
9894560	9900800	war thunder community for their dastardly arcs the forest burns our warriors flee before the humans
9901360	9909200	these are drinking what hmm the rda must be gunning me and me I say actually all of them
9909200	9913280	you know what well that's it all of them we can't escape the the p-corp jokes
9913280	9917920	is the time to counter their attack or must be risked in times of need
9919920	9925840	just all of them are at it honestly I mean if you think about it as there is milk heels
9926560	9934160	so what would the other liquids do I don't know I don't know we didn't lure that that wasn't
9934160	9942080	concepted but up to you what you think the other ones do uh what is this area I seem to have
9942160	9948480	forgotten this map I actually don't remember it the warriors here know the land uh the obligatory
9948480	9953840	okay please be the last song because no more song missions please see if they can find big b we could
9953840	9958480	use this big b all right just marry big b this much at this point I feel love them so much
9959440	9966640	he enjoys crushing skulls of many tortu tortu or humans when you have all I want to have squid
9966640	9974080	ink spaghetti is that because of me be honest time to find out hey oh strony you didn't have shebe
9974080	9980000	you didn't hear shebe's discussion about oh no actually this is one thing that I'm actually
9980000	9987200	genuinely a bit sad about because I stream so much I don't have time to watch everyone's streams
9987200	9995600	and it ups it like it genuinely upsets me like um I raided into mercy yesterday and she was playing
9995600	10000800	oh mario or whatever the name of the game is oh I've never seen it or played it before
10002080	10008080	and um she was like yeah I've been quite adorably but I just feel bad that like I don't have time
10008080	10013040	like just everything like when I popped into ac stream playing that puzzle game obviously
10013600	10019520	shebe's live right now I have terrible news but I don't have shebe uh in my ear right now
10019520	10023840	that you guys can't hear whilst I game and stream and talk at the same time it's just not possible
10023840	10032320	for me I do not remember this map at all I'm like um let's go for it let's see what this maps all about
10032320	10048320	then what is this is this a run through type of thing uh no this is a search what is going on
10048400	10050480	whoa this is pretty
10054080	10061600	what is going on I need to learn to do that protection spell more wait why did the area
10061600	10068160	just moved wait so am I supposed to kill those in the area let's go let's see yeah it's kind of
10068160	10074480	shame that all your streams are overlapping I will say one thing I did ask the girls to push
10074480	10080240	on the first week to stream as much as possible however um some of them are going to settle into
10080240	10088240	streaming um I literally said to them do not even dare stream every single day after this like you
10088240	10093600	will be taking breaks that like I was I've lit and they can all vouch that I told them straight to
10093600	10099360	their faces don't you dare stream every single day the only reason I can do it is because I don't
10099360	10105440	experience burnout the only reason I would not stream is if I am on death's door I'm not even
10105440	10111920	kidding um oh that horse is beating me up they're jumping me wait use the ultimate use the heal
10111920	10117680	heal heal heal my goodness you're so so what am I supposed to do here stop
10117840	10119840	oh
10122640	10126240	I'm gonna need to take these um getting hurt by something um
10129760	10138000	what am I getting hurt by I have no idea right wait why am I just to run around these sectors
10138000	10147280	or just stop it oh there's more of them here I need to heal are you forcing them to take breaks
10147280	10153120	I'm not gonna tell them not to stream because that's not my place to do that but I will be
10153920	10160000	worried if as time goes on like I've noticed one of them are like non-stop streaming
10162320	10168240	but I will always like take their like if they say they're fine I'm not gonna question it I'm not
10168240	10172400	I'm absolutely not gonna question it if they want to stream they can stream but I would be a bit
10172480	10177840	worried like hopefully you're not like overdone you're safe because when I do it it's fine but
10177840	10182400	when others do it hold on a minute I'm getting worried I'm I'm turning in a mother mode like are
10182400	10186320	you okay uh is there something I could help you with is there like a reason behind the scenes why
10186320	10191360	you want to stream everything you know I just want to make sure you're okay baby okay you're my you're
10191360	10198400	my wing you're my wing oh my goodness uh you literally just stopped me from doing that ultimate
10199200	10202400	okay objective perfectly right okay we did it we did it
10204720	10210720	take care of your daughters these uh unironically I've been getting nightmares about my daughters
10211280	10218720	um I had a nightmare that I didn't redirect into one of them and then they wanted to leave
10218720	10223520	violor because of that and I literally put in the message I was like am I real mummy now
10223760	10229440	without her because I'm like I'm literally having nightmares like of like oh no something's not
10229440	10239840	going right or like I've done something wrong are we babies here we go well like uh I managed to get
10239840	10246560	streaming did no streaming detachment anxiety that's not the word is it oh wait am I supposed to go
10246560	10257440	this way um separation anxiety from the reefing um that happened and I don't know if I'm gonna develop
10257440	10264880	it again for a little bit uh plausible but it's happened with the girls where when I go to sleep
10264880	10269600	I get so nervous for them and like I'm worried like something might happen to them and I'm not
10269600	10276480	there to like help them through it or something um but yeah yesterday was weird going after
10276480	10280080	the tulip remarks there was so much time in the day but the good news is I got a lot
10280080	10292560	behind the scenes work done wait follow me uh I may or may not blast into that dialogue and I don't
10292560	10305680	know I'm at his court her Mr. Horsey that was me twat wait what oh fucking spank you today what

10373200	10379280	sleeper but when I was born she became a late sleeper and I'm like I feel that because I've
10379280	10383600	not had like a really good night's sleep since debut oh before debut I didn't even have a good
10383600	10390720	sleep either and the yap is the best part also in general a really cute thing for now is that
10391520	10396960	they are yapping a lot but not a bad way no I love when the girls yap honestly it's like so nice to
10396960	10402320	listen to like their stories and and the situations have been in they've been in like quite humorous
10402320	10411120	situations um and it's just like fun to hear different people talk from like different walks
10411120	10418560	of life like I know that sounds so freaking weird to say but like um it's just fascinating it just
10419200	10423360	I don't know I just I just find it fascinating I feel like you can also learn a lot from people's
10423360	10429040	stories as well even if it's a humorous story normally there's some sort of like thing or
10429040	10433680	element where they can look back and giggle and be like oh I wouldn't have done that no but like
10433680	10438640	oh wasn't it funny at the time and like you know just little good things I should maybe do a
10438640	10444400	reefling story time where we share stories and it'll be like sure like I would be have to be like a
10444400	10452800	google submission thing and it's like oh share your um share like a memory that makes you embarrassed
10452800	10458480	and like I'll read them out and then I'll share you an embarrassing story of mine um like that
10458480	10462320	kind of stuff I would absolutely love to do I feel like those kind of interactive streams are
10462320	10466400	quite funny and we can all like kind of have a wee giggle at each other also you guys must
10466400	10472000	remind me to brush my teeth at the end of the stream I keep forgetting to brush my teeth
10472880	10482480	for that guy and um we need to do it together for 21 days so we can establish uh our beautiful
10482560	10485200	training uh yes

10496880	10500400	go got it I don't I've forgotten what behind is derriere
10502320	10508640	village derriereville and then rock is probably just like l rock

10516240	10528560	or is this a fate is this a fate oh it's a fate it's on peer protection I'm literally a warlock

10540400	10545600	I'm getting raked by the I leveled up though but I'm currently getting absolutely you can
10545600	10551120	literally see the ammo shot that is coming from me from that freaking thing oh unlock new armor
10551120	10559920	whoa I'm naked is that less protection oh no it's the exact same oh if it's the same as the green
10559920	10570240	one yeah we'll just use it um oh my god am I through your reload or something geez get me out

10578080	10579920	try to speak as I say so it's not so
10580960	10585280	literally I was green a minute ago with my armor and then it all disappeared and I'm like excuse me
10585280	10589920	where's my uh protection via armor like you're telling me the navies still haven't figured out
10589920	10594800	that uh maybe we should literally have bullets or getting thrown and you're telling me the
10594800	10601280	navie haven't figured out that we should probably there is much they say you can do uh I can do
10601280	10606720	a shard nearby I'm going to drink a water you should think about hygiene near the east village
10606720	10610800	you must help we were attacked by humans many have died
10613520	10622000	you are not too late go find Alona when he can help and Mercy says uh I'm sorry I've accidentally
10622000	10625760	stumbled into the algorithm on Twitter and I'm like congrats because I don't know how the heck it
10625760	10632640	works either uh and a lot has been used to find all low new in in the village of to the east
10632640	10641040	the red feathers look pretty bad uh where are we going oh a bit of a bit of a walk oh no no
10641040	10649520	not a bit of a walk well because there's a horsey horsey easy bear would you let me read you and
10649520	10655600	say easy there like this dire horse from the hit video game James Cameron's avatar released in
10656000	10657920	2009 um
10661360	10666080	how many resurrections do I have I've actually not been collecting much samples does that attack me
10666080	10675680	are you friendly oh well that got answered real quick didn't it whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
10675680	10682720	whoa whoa whoa whoa a bit too much action on these roads for me a bit too much not only I would
10682720	10689360	say my only complaint about this game is that you can never freely explore the land like things
10689360	10694000	constantly keep respawning which I'm not a fan of I quite like the idea of like clearing out an area
10694000	10698960	and then it's like safe every time you like want to come back we're gonna unlock the tree of vision
10701280	10709440	this game well this game did become PlayStation Platinum um uh apparently there's a multiplayer
10709520	10716880	mode in this game I don't ever recall playing that as a child so it's running when is the history
10716880	10724160	stream of yapping about the Irish potato family I was gonna do a teachers day where we have like
10724160	10730640	40 minute or well maybe 30 minute classes so we do like English study and then we do like a French
10730640	10737200	class and then we'll do like a PE class and we're like literally I'll just instruct you on what we're
10737200	10745200	supposed to do and you'll just hear me jump up and down in my room um um what other we'll do mass
10745200	10753120	as well I'll teach board mass is how we do it in the UK or maybe maybe just Scotland I don't know
10753120	10759040	uh board masses brackets of division multiplication addition subtraction is different what the heck
10759040	10764240	am I supposed to do I wasn't paying attention I think I'm supposed to collect things in this area
10764240	10769120	yes I am I am to collect things in this area if that's the case in viz right now
10770640	10775520	right we'll just do the outskirts of the area because I think that kind of highlights what the
10775520	10787280	daily was where the heck over oh there is right there's one I can hear lots of enemies but I'm
10787280	10795600	trying not to engage in any of them I am gonna get him to not attack me by doing this nope that
10795600	10802480	was not that wasn't it oopsies literally just aggro time on me for no reason oh there is we need one
10802480	10817040	more pink tentacle oh there is there is right we're safe safe safe safe safe we're gonna try and
10817040	10821760	avoid all the fights because you really do once you do like if you engage in all the fights you
10821760	10827360	really do get like tangled up and all this time strongy teaching man and it's not gonna go well
10827360	10831840	but like we would do all the most basic covers like we do biology we'll do physics we'll do
10831840	10837280	chemistry and like a full day and the way I was gonna do it is we're not allowed to progress
10837280	10842400	until you guys actually give me the correct answer so depending on how fast you do it we'll get through
10842400	10847120	the school day like really fast but like I'll put a little I don't know if I can get like a teacher
10848160	10855040	I don't know maybe put like a graduation cap oh wait hold on I just realized I'm not gonna light
10855200	10860340	on that's why my mouth tracking has been all funny hold on hold on professional streamer moment
10867040	10871600	I'm gonna recalibrate just because I keep seeing my mouth is wiggling away I assure you I'm not
10871600	10875600	about to cry you know when someone's about to cry then their mouth starts wiggling that's what I do
10875600	10883500	anyway but we will recalibrate a little tricky a recalibration nope and my
10883500	10888280	blanket is currently trapped around the microphone that's not fair Mr. Blanket
10888280	10894600	please please work with me here your math phobia I hope you have a math
10894600	10901040	phobia numbers oh so I was calibrating so I had to go in the dead silence
10901040	10907600	what you scared the numbers oh multiplication oh yeah that terrify
10907600	10915080	you that stuff made out of nightmares for you yeah where's these horses
10919440	10924040	you could give a history lesson on the battle of bannock born I absolutely will
10924040	10931160	we'll do we'll have a Scottish lessons stream a segment for it because if we're
10931160	10936200	gonna study English later at your name I'm gonna stay off the horse for this I
10936200	10939280	think I'm just picking these people up horse you're in my way thank you

10974080	10977280	knows you're coming oh my god a veiler group calibration with the math cuz
10977280	10981880	apparently all of you struggle with math literally I like playing in the
10981880	10985960	criminal games but you know I don't actually like doing the thinking part
10985960	11000880	when it comes to numbers so yeah this is the way to victory to victory to
11000880	11009080	victory this is the way to victory and this is a way we'll go I'm actually so
11009080	11014240	fast on this is this faster than the Thanator actually might be you know oh
11014280	11018760	there's so many samples around here I'm just gonna check oh I'm actually max on

11043800	11046960	it a little shot like just as a five 15-minute practice and they were like
11046960	11049400	we're not playing that and I was that's fine that's fine you don't have to play
11049400	11057560	it's fine fine I wanted to see if I could do it with the refling but then I'd
11057560	11064280	have to like if I could do it yeah they wonder the rock killed me it's sort of
11064280	11069440	flipping entire boulder on my skull are you joking how is that supposed to know
11069440	11076040	that was about time that's outrageous oh map design change what's in here
11076040	11082920	enemies got a lot of oh can you guess really not see
11086440	11095640	okay I give up I give up that's really annoying what's going on here I've done
11095640	11099480	protection I've got knocked back I hate when they knock you back because that's
11099480	11105160	when you can just absolutely eat all of the damage that they're laying out which
11105160	11114480	is not good yeah like I'm literally getting so injured this your spawn point
11114480	11119440	is it behind here you suck give me that spawn point get that spawn point out
11119440	11125200	here oh we're just like literally going back
11128720	11134880	could you do a lesson on Mary Kunis cause honestly oh my god I have to make you

11146800	11159440	a little don't carry anything down the dusty road something like that force choir
11159440	11163480	I'll have to get us all to sing at the same time but it has to be it has to be
11163480	11169360	like internet culture songs because why are we why did why did he just oh there's
11169360	11176160	a dog there but a dog dog with a book and I don't know what songs I could make
11176320	11183040	sing it would have to be related to meme culture what did you guys think about all
11183040	11193200	the songs that made the girls sing I freaking how am I supposed to avoid that
11193200	11197280	I'm sorry there's absolutely no way you can dodge that unless you went to attack
11197360	11200000	but if you am I am I going the wrong way
11204400	11209520	I've gone horrifically the wrong way sorry I had to like really think there I think I'm
11209520	11216800	actually about to lose my dire horse coming back here because of this car yeah wow literally
11217680	11223360	Brian what if the game show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a
11223360	11230480	different subject eyes hold on I'm getting absolutely right hold on protection in viz
11230480	11236640	let's go oh and viz sorry right hold on narrow thank you for the tip hey shroney what if
11236640	11241120	veal or game show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a different
11241120	11247200	I'm sorry I can't do two things at once hold on hold on what way did I go stick to this one
11248160	11253680	oh oh oh I'm no I'm no I'm no smart enough to do two things at once I'm gonna have to read
11253680	11260160	that all over again one more time take it from the top hey strong why is there more enemies
11260160	11264000	what if veal or game show with the girls where they stream the question there are different
11264000	11269840	there the great questions are every so we do have one game show coming up that I'm gonna make
11269840	11280160	I am going to reach out to a creator for possibly they already do a game show but I was gonna set
11280160	11286400	it up for them so literally they can just rack in all the money if you didn't know the easiest way
11286400	11292240	to collab with people is to do all the work but let them like take over type thing it's the most
11293360	11299520	likely way that a collab opportunities will be accepted so I've got possibly a game show
11299760	11305760	we're going to show up on someone else's channel and and then I'll get like a highlight reel made
11306560	11312640	and so I need to reach out to another creator but I'm letting this first week settle down like
11312640	11316960	it's been a bit hectic like trying to get a script manager in place and we're trying to
11316960	11323120	deal with this clipping issue that we've kind of right now things are a bit slow to be produced
11323120	11327840	but the girls are going to have shorts that come out consistently on their channels at some point
11330400	11338480	but like me and she be are literally lagging for shorts because I'm waiting to get us monetized
11338480	11344400	first before we start putting shorts out because this is just a fact but shorts do better if
11344400	11352480	there's something in them that's a bit humorous in that way and the one that I got a she be to do
11352480	11358560	that a fauna speedrun challenge like that did well and all and I actually really she got to show
11358560	11368400	off her mine like voice which is absolutely perfect but the other ones I actually got her to discuss
11371600	11378880	milk body type v-tubers which I thought was super interesting but I'm too scared to put it up
11379600	11385920	right now because I would be mortified if the girls didn't get accepted for monetization
11386880	11394640	and this recent ASMR stuff geez I'm literally getting grenade launched my goodness draw destroy
11394640	11402080	the amp soup well okay I'm gonna say where is it um but there will be a lot of shorts coming up
11402080	11411280	like one monetization is freaking dealt with uh because the stats updated but it only updated
11411360	11417760	halfway through debut so it says I still haven't reached watch hours even though I think I have
11417760	11424320	like a stupendous amount of watch hours now especially after that assassins creed my assassins
11424320	11431200	creed brother you'd stream almost has more views than my debut stream which is hilarious to think
11431200	11435600	about because I streamed for so long and I guess people just didn't expect it so like they came
11435600	11443520	back in the stream twice at some point you made 20 hours in two days literally like but after
11443520	11448480	debut we all successfully had enough watch time at that point it's just youtube has taken an entire
11448480	11454160	week to update and today I was supposed to be able to apply everyone's channel for monetization
11454160	11464560	but it only partially updated the thing I think it's faster if I jump no just jump down on this
11464560	11471040	bridge that comes up um but I only did it halfway through debut so I need to wait another 24 hours
11471040	11478880	for it to update and then I can submit all the girls channels um like I've got an ASMR short
11478880	11488000	of sheebie as well but Azura's short got denied for monetization for advertisement and I think it's
11488000	11494720	literally because her voice is just too strong like I don't know how but her her voice is too
11494720	11499920	strong it needs nerve oh I really don't want to go down if that's there can I destroy this
11502160	11506080	hold on did I just snipe him out of that car
11509360	11515520	did that car just disappear I'm just gonna invis through this section but that looks like
11515520	11524240	I sniked him out that car no I clearly didn't because he's right there you don't hear anything
11524240	11530400	that's called the AI cheating what's this a bomb ooh a bomb
11533440	11539680	ooh a bomb whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa there's far too many of you right now there's far too many
11539760	11546080	of you right now oh my gosh oh my gosh I've done it now I've done it now I've done it now I've done
11546080	11553200	now commit commit commit commit submit conceptguitar where's the one where's the one just one more in
11553200	11558400	here there is a siya siya siya siya we can do this we can do this as long as I do I do it
11558400	11563840	I'll hit checkpoint right get me that head out here ooh I don't have heal yet I don't have
11563840	11571720	I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal.
11571720	11572720	What's going on?
11572720	11573720	Why?
11573720	11578320	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, get on the horse, get on the horse, get on the horse,
11578320	11579320	get on the horse.
11579320	11582320	Am I on the wrong side?
11582320	11587320	If I go this way, I can teleport to that other one and then go from there.
11587320	11588800	Yes, we will do that.
11588800	11590800	Oh no, there's another one of these.
11590800	11593320	Oh my gosh, they're so pee.
11593320	11597160	Goodness gravy.
11597160	11599280	What does that even mean?
11599280	11606720	How, literally, I think it's because very sadly sheepsters in Azura might have a cover
11606720	11617000	up for their, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, we're kind of,
11617000	11621960	we're at the question mark stage of what's the problem, what's the issue, but we'll
11621960	11623360	get there, okay.
11623360	11626480	Did I say thank you for the tip, Nero?
11626480	11627480	Sorry if I didn't.
11627480	11634640	But yes, there are game show type-esque things coming up, there's no horse games.
11634640	11639320	November is my Scottish game show, I don't know if one of the girls might be interested
11639320	11651160	in holding a type of VTuber collab game show, I'll need to see, mate, I was actually helping
11651480	11652480	you, do you mind?
11652480	11655480	Jeez, you're so rude and stinky.
11655480	11661720	Alright, I think I'm to go this way and then, I'm sorry, I'm getting really switched around
11661720	11666920	with this freaking map, but we'll just, we'll go for it, we'll send it.
11666920	11674640	Ooh, no thank you, no thank you, no thank you, hehehe, not interested, no thank you.
11674640	11680680	Your horses butt is soaking up all those bullets like a cha- honestly, stagger an amount of
11680680	11684360	endurance on that thing.
11684360	11691640	The Easter wheels, oh, are they finally giving me a path with no enemies?
11691640	11695960	You know what, I'm not speaking ever again, that's a ridiculous timing, you've embarrassed
11695960	11698280	me.
11698280	11702240	I would, I think that's my only complaint about this game, it would be so nice if there
11702240	11706400	was areas that you could just enjoy for the beauty, which I know this sounds like such
11706400	11710920	a weird thing to say, but like, I really, I like admiring the game, okay?
11710920	11716280	I'm a little, a little map design admirer and like look at how much nature there is.
11716280	11720160	I'm pretty sure there's actually a steam game that came out and it's all about identifying
11720160	11725440	plants in nature and I'm like, honestly, I wish I was like more entertaining so I could
11725440	11729640	play it, but I'm not that entertaining, B or B, I gotta go somewhere, okay let me just
11729640	11735960	pause the stream, we'll wait for you to come back, see you when you come back.
11736960	11750720	Oh, it's not Osha, is it Peeta, P-E-T-A, Peeta, that's that animal organisation, Peeta,
11750720	11755640	Peeta, that's not working in my head, I don't think it's Peeta.
11755640	11762400	Oh, new armour, oh, check that out, oh I like that, hold on, let's do a little wardrobe
11762400	11765440	check, wardrobe check, oh wait, whoa.
11765440	11771000	My mobility is way down, but my protection is so up from that, we might leave that up,
11771000	11779800	I'd rather like have more indefinite protection than having to deal with all these issues,
11779800	11781960	with constantly like getting barraged.
11781960	11792640	Ah, right, okay, crystal, crystal, crystal, crystal, let's beat them up, where's the crystal?
11793360	11800840	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, steady on, steady on, where's the crystal, I'm like literally
11800840	11809600	jump-scaring these guys, whoa, you were on the crystal, alright, where is it, am I staring
11809600	11815640	at it, oh it's up, oh wow, okay, I wouldn't have known that, it's like I was on that
11815640	11825680	crystal there, mission complete, wee, ow, my ankles, no again, protection is more important,
11825680	11835960	the mobility, I would say so yeah, that's a big old horse ride, um, can I, wait is that,
11835960	11842240	that is done, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, just reading them up, yeah, I don't know where
11842320	11846240	to go, I don't know where to go, I don't know, really turned around, I think it would be
11846240	11860160	faster if I took a teleport near this location, um, hello, uh, I have to redo the set, alright,
11860160	11868760	okay, no, I just fell through the map, okay, classic open, but there we go, I think we're
11868800	11874040	actually getting pretty close, I have never done that before, I guess this game, I mean
11874040	11880920	I did say that games have problems with vertical stuff, especially older games, when it comes
11880920	11887360	to mapping you just fall through the map so many times in older games, right, we're gonna
11887360	11897360	teleport where, it looks like that and then just take a weird straight ahead, what a strange
11897480	11907280	layout for a map, a skill issue honestly, childhood me would never do that, and yet here we are
11907280	11917000	being an even worse gamer, pardon me, I'm doing this with baby birds this time, I saw the
11917000	11926600	truck, I saw it, wait I need to claim this, I don't know, oh my, I don't know if I'm,
11926720	11931640	can I get away with this, oh my god I can get away with it, oh, oh that poor horse I've
11931640	11936040	just left it, I'm so sorry you get to meet Ewa now, hush hush, your plight is over, you
11936040	11943200	no longer have to, you can frolic in the fields in Ewa's heaven now, if I've just left you,
11943200	11953440	to perish to the RDA, ooh, I would make the joke but I don't have any more sound effects,
11953480	11958600	magic your way to the other side of the map honestly, a bit cheeky to claim when there's an
11958600	11964880	entire tank shooting at you, you're the best gamer I am especially when you rage, oh no, I
11964880	11970720	always feel bad when I rage because I feel like it's like, I like doing what I like to see and if
11970720	11975840	I see like a streamer rage I'm like, I'm not sure I'm finding this entertaining but if you guys
11975840	11983320	like it then sure I'll tap into my ancestors rage, I'm literally the, is it the orcs and
11983400	11991400	Skyrim, I think their special move is called Ancestral's Rage and it's like 10% more, or
11991400	11998240	Berserk type thing, it's like 10% more damage, what's going on here, the last song, right,
11998240	12004120	look for the thumping when bumping, nope, there's a fight, why is there a fight, I thought I just
12004120	12011640	had to interact with the tree, did I not have to interact with the tree, oh, okay, okay, okay,
12011800	12015000	we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, come on, let's do it before
12015000	12021160	they destroy absolutely everything, is it not here, triangle, hello triangle, looking for a
12021160	12027960	triangle, triangle, this is a triangle, there we go, are they going to blow the tree up before
12027960	12034200	I get the phone, no the Ancestral stuff was done more, Berserkers rage is the one that works out,
12034520	12041800	ah, right, invisible because we're not out here trying to have a billion battles every two seconds,
12043160	12047640	yeah, probably feedback on the game, kind of calm down on how many enemies you put on the map
12047640	12054680	because they are constant, hello barrier, did this, did this game really say go around,
12056200	12062600	no way this game just said go around, oh no it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine,
12064600	12070440	yes, yes, let's get out of here, this place is gonna blow, oh, we must return to Kellotron,
12070440	12077160	take your ecran, we ride to home tree, okay, we go to home tree, home tree,
12083400	12087400	I think we're getting there, I can't really recall how much more to the campaign there is,
12087800	12093480	this would be three songs and if we're playing the classic video game rule,
12097800	12103800	I can't remember what comes after the third song, I swear if it's like go for another song on my
12103800	12110120	right, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up, you're taking a bit too long now, take a bit too long,
12110120	12113720	we're gonna need to do something a bit more than home questing, but look how cool that armor looks
12113720	12119800	honestly, that's pretty thick, it would be so cool to see this game remastered,
12119800	12126440	but I do not think it sold well, I think it hardly did it, it's numeros, hello,
12129320	12137080	we love them, James Cameron you did it again, is it snowing, no,
12137080	12140360	let's hope we're getting close, we don't find it soon, this whole planet's gonna
12140360	12147480	fly, winter in Australia is just fake, it never goes below freezing,
12150440	12154040	yes yes the song, the song, ay was song, please be the last song, no more singing,
12154280	12158520	ah ah ah ah ah,
12162200	12166840	tells where it is, please, no more songs, surely we know what's up,
12166840	12174680	many of the people believe in you yet some fear the tattooed spirit inside you let me get
12174680	12179800	fedama he blames you for much there was just a whole missing voice line i think
12181560	12190200	it was so hard to come to our realization that christmas is summer final song it's not natural
12190920	12198280	but it's a pretty decided once i wrap up a business that i am going back to
12202760	12207880	yeah if you ever went to open up a business in the uk don't you better do it in australia
12207880	12210280	but then go back to the uk once you're done with all your business
12210760	12214840	yeah here for more entrepreneur tips
12216440	12217400	like and subscribe
12222840	12229080	tanjala wants you to fly to a new location i don't know what this
12230920	12234520	i'm afraid my memory is getting very easy now for the game
12234920	12243560	you'd kill for a warm christmas it is bizarre i did not enjoy it like i phoned my family
12244520	12254440	and i was like oh i wish it was cold i wish it was cold um because you do get snowy christmas

12267560	12273560	where sky machine has crushed you are so mean i've literally been helping you for ages
12274280	12277800	i'm sorry but i think enough time to pass where he should be all right with me
12277800	12284920	and you're giving me any nonsense you make it sound so mystical it's very beautiful
12284920	12289080	where the what the heck is this map i do not recall at all
12291320	12295960	memories getting a little bit easy i can't see where the map ends because of that very
12295960	12302920	top right corner very clearly that's where this map location ends but i don't know what happens here
12305080	12311320	i can't believe it right i think we're just gonna leg it as we always do
12311320	12318360	but yeah like these look the map details like the kind of the further you progress the more
12318360	12326040	damage the areas are and you know it was trying our hardest but like there's only only so much
12326040	12332440	awa can do and the navi can do against literal bullets i have to admit bows versus bullets
12332440	12337640	like i'd rather have the rather have the mp5 or the famine so my wait why did i get off i just
12337720	12342200	want to activate that oh well i needed to get off anyway because i need to cut up in this fence
12342200	12347960	i'm itching my little whoa is this elden ring oh you've got this right let's see
12350600	12357160	uh we'll just avoid thank you for spawning in but not really interested me wait am i going
12357160	12364360	the wrong way no i can go this way i just happened to walk right into an rda uh aligned and i need
12364360	12370600	to cut this fence as well goodness gravy i might make a cup of tea shortly and go for a peep because
12370600	12377400	we've actually not peeped in three and a half hours of uh unless some of you guys have a detached
12377400	12385800	headset and then you go for a peep whilst whilst still listening to oh the fact that there's a
12385800	12391880	very high chance that a reefling has dropped a loaf of bread while listening to me ramble on stream
12391880	12398200	that's right reefling i'm on air i know exactly what you're up to mm-hmm i know what's going on
12401480	12408760	a drop a loaf of bread honestly drop apparently the there's another same which is a drop the
12408760	12418680	kids off at the pool which is a guilty is charged oh no it's been confirmed you know when people
12418760	12422360	say like oh what did you what what did you think would happen like when you became a
12422360	12428440	vertebra etc uh apparently i didn't account for someone dropping a loaf of bread to my voice so
12428440	12435480	there's that yeah um yeah quite a few unique scenarios definitely definitely
12439240	12444280	how are you ever like he teleports around this map for fun i swear okay hello
12444520	12454040	no the shard was blown up not sure not sure the first voice is not sure oh i'm being called
12454040	12457400	the first voice i'm no longer dreamwalker oh my tummy rumbled if you heard that
12458680	12463000	listen into your patreon audio we'll see in a man about horse
12466200	12470680	i didn't want to miss the second of your beautiful voice though if it's any consolation
12471320	12477160	you make dropping and you make dropping a loaf of bread hell a lot more comfortable you're done
12477160	12479480	you're out out you're done
12482200	12489480	we would be not identifying as loaf of bread droppers oh that came out nowhere
12490200	12496520	oh my poor horse i should have picked up a new one
12497960	12502120	because he's so low health i want him to retire and live a happy life
12502120	12505240	but i don't think that's gonna is a left or right it's this way
12513800	12515960	she knows too much hey yeah
12516360	12523720	oh right i'm gonna pick up this horse here because i would like this one to literally
12523720	12529400	retire and have a happy life excuse me mr. horsey see you go enjoy yourself and heal up and then
12529400	12530840	i'm gonna have you
12533720	12538760	and then everyone lived happily ever after and the and everyone around me clapped yay
12539160	12544520	hey that's what we're supposed to listen to the first honestly though
12546200	12554280	um wow that's a lot of power about a lot of manpower behind that
12555560	12559640	they're destroying the crystals before we get them is someone telling them this
12562840	12564680	how do they know where the heck all these crystals are
12565640	12572280	right we'll finish this map and then we'll go for a tinkle and i will also go for a
12572280	12577720	tinkle and make a cup of honey tea to help soothe my curve voice it's really bizarre
12578440	12585320	my voice is so broken but the microphone makes it sound so like fine and not broke wait can i
12585320	12597240	just teleport no um so i sound like pretty normal on stream my voice has been broken since uh the
12598360	12605720	the violor exposed violor stream um i don't know thankfully i've managed to record a lot of
12605720	12613000	stuff in advance but don't be surprised if you get a patreon audio and i'm just sound like a frog
12613000	12619080	i'm like yeah you like that good boy and you're such a good wee boy and you like my toad boy like
12619080	12627640	it's getting it's getting curious it's getting curious and you are a demon how is it you live
12629320	12635240	honestly that's kind of a fair assumption there's something i gotta tell you we must have been
12635480	12645560	those who have fallen do some patreon videos in full pantomime you get 3d models and start like
12645560	12655080	mime in the axe yeah wouldn't be the first thing patreon looks and audio in me a little frog voice
12655080	12661480	moment you let a horse die oh it was a mistake i can't save them all but i can try my best
12662280	12668440	also i just want to say i am still getting marshmallows of people asking me to save
12668440	12673960	each oh that horse literally just perished right before me oh where am i supposed to go
12673960	12677800	uh that's quite far to go by foot but we don't really have a choice there's no more horsey
12677800	12689240	boysy um skull horse skull women sound really cute when their voice is cracked and squeak
12689320	12696200	from over use and they're giggling asking you to say what no they're they're asking me to save
12697080	12703640	certain v-tubers and i said it on that stream the other day and like we're all having a giggle
12703640	12709160	but i woke up and i got a few more and i'm like i don't i don't know if it's reef link sending it
12709160	12716120	or whatever but like i'm gonna be on it oh it's full health again um i'm gonna be honest uh i hope
12716120	12721320	it's understandable no i can't literally save all v-tubers you know i'll try my best to look
12721320	12728120	after those who have faith in me um you know i'm a big believer in reciprocation in terms of you
12728120	12738440	have faith in me i have faith in you type thing oh well i better not am i on a timer and i don't
12738440	12752040	know it i think i'm on a timer gotta go gotta go gotta go i know i know i know i know i'm trying
12754440	12761640	i can unlock this uh tree of vision you can leave from the front and try and change i think
12762200	12772680	the content creator owned agencies definitely have a place um definitely have a place um
12773560	12780360	because i think people are a bit it's not for me to say what the the overall feel is but i think
12781720	12787560	for me anyway it was very disappointing to learn how little creators that sign up for
12787560	12793640	these agencies get in exchange for all their hard work because did he just go ahead me powerful
12793640	12800440	then a river did he just go ahead me um hello hello human resources do you guys have human
12800440	12809960	resources on pandora because um what was that excuse me uh yeah because we have very specific
12810040	12817560	unlikely but um i did actually learn about another agency that did have a higher split
12817560	12824200	than the 5050 which i'm i'm quite happy to hear about um so i think hopefully over time that 5050
12824200	12830200	split uh gets raised because i will tell you right now for however hard the girls work on
12830200	12835000	stream it's absolutely nothing to do with me i don't tell them what to do they do it all themselves
12835000	12842760	um and i believe that they should take home the lion's share that's just me but not every
12843320	12850840	agency out there feels like that um but if you value um if you genuinely like as a special thank
12850840	12855240	you is what wait hold on i'm getting absolutely annihilated here do i need to take these down i
12855240	12866440	think so hold on i'm doing i cast protection what's going on here am i just to destroy
12867320	12874440	because i'll do it ow we're on the same team right i don't have protection anymore but
12874440	12882200	uh okay okay we're to just kill i can do that i can do that we but i'm a weapon
12883640	12887800	what's this is this and can i not know uh
12889560	12894920	whoa whoa whoa you're not agro to me hey hey yay yay yay yay we're helping a while we're
12894920	12900040	helping helping you know what helping is yeah these guys these are the best
12900280	12907800	are they spawning oh my game just froze there did you see that i don't know if that was calling
12907800	12912920	stream or not but that was for me and i thought i can hear bullets from over here so we check out
12914360	12923640	okay let's go oh one more one more mission oh here here spawned a navi resources
12930040	12932040	the world would be a beautiful place if you're more like me
12933720	12935400	the only the only problem is uh
12937880	12941720	you never know if someone wants to take like advantage of you but i i got very lucky in
12941720	12945560	all my pics of the girls and none of them have given any indication such things
12946360	12952760	we got the crimson yeah froze i saw that monk is monk is monk is please don't please don't crash
12952760	12953880	please don't crash please don't crash
12957640	12964040	and yes i've um i've always been described as naive like my entire life um and i like i'm

14408840	14417640	out a war planned on you kind of i don't know it's really bizarre oh a scalp the perimeter comb that
14417640	14425400	beach why is that phrase called comb a beach what's that you mean what does it mean what does it even
14425400	14431720	translate to am i going the wrong way i'm getting nervous i'm going to they can literally hear me
14431720	14440040	like jump a boot i hear them oh my going to make it is in this oh i almost made it past all those
14440040	14447720	rda soldiers i'll take it i'll take it a couple paths yeah i assume when we play the rda side
14447720	14454040	we're literally just playing the exact same maps but doing the opposite of the bad people
14455000	14461400	and destroying everything wow i need prediction on right now i'm getting
14461960	14468360	absolutely nailed them right now i don't want to use healing because i actually do a full health bar
14468360	14476200	when i heal let's uh let's speed on speed on through okay this looks more navvy oriented
14477080	14482520	four hours is it going to be another endurance stream i think so originally it wasn't but um
14482520	14488520	um i got paid money to play the rda side and you guys are holding my hand through it because
14488520	14496200	i am genuinely afraid of what happens hello how do you do i'll hope lies with you dreamwalkers excuse
14496200	14500440	me i'm actually called the first voice i'm no longer i didn't i don't respond to dreamwalker i'm the
14500440	14510840	first boy will not let them any first voicers has asked you to kill rda forces yeah so emmy is going
14510840	14522040	live youtube moderators i grant the permission to link a sheet stream it is mine it's unarchived
14522040	14531240	okay smart and mckels smart smart embers uh this looks like it's uh destroy everything mission
14531240	14536760	because there's a timer oh right there is actually a timer on the day i don't know if any protection
14536760	14542520	spell yet i'll wait until i'm getting whacked i don't i'm not experiencing the whacking yet
14545240	14552440	uh i'm gone right okay i think the game's actually getting mildly oh my god imagine
14552440	14558920	three navvy ganging up on you it's over it's over i wouldn't even bother just put the gun down and be
14558920	14563560	like uh actually i'm gonna be one of you oh wait hold it sorry i'm getting distracted protection
14563560	14569640	i've casted protection okay there we go gang violence gang violence we're literally
14569640	14576840	ganging up in the fur guy oh that's terrible absolutely a wipe in the night i guess
14579560	14587000	one for you one spank for you and one for you okay we just need to defend the village now
14587000	14594440	without perishing which i can definitely i can hear someone getting hurt over here oh yeah
14596520	14599720	one for the true warfare i think we're cheering each other on
14601080	14609480	we responsible i was just okay i'm gonna need that prayer to pop again because now there's mecha
14609480	14614040	getting involved demon skin parish
14618680	14627720	but yes uh emmy bezu uh the beloved hex maniacal dealer is live right now you are welcome to jump

14635400	14638760	want any issues wink wink uh
14643800	14648680	imagine assassin's speed but planer's attempt yeah that's what i'm kind of like why on earth
14649320	14657560	would anyone want to do the rda but like money talks dirty cash i want you dirty cash i want you
14657560	14667240	oh money talking money talking stupid oh um oh camera angle steady steady right we've got one more
14667240	14679560	minute isn't that a game already what game are you partly viewing about identify your topic of conversation
14679800	14691400	one two three four five ultimate yeah honestly that ultimate is actually pretty sad so i'm gonna
14691400	14696520	heal because it's not gonna all heal when we're not around it because the enemies keep coming back
14696520	14708200	so protection oh there's a mech over there i think oh it's out of bounds wow i just do this for now
14709800	14717240	oh no no i won't somebody's getting me oh maybe not maybe not the navi are actually helping hold on
14717240	14722520	ai that actually attacks the enemies that are around you hold on a minute this game's 2009 and
14722520	14728040	you're telling me they nailed it here and then games afterwards it's my biggest like great
14729000	14735000	with video game development if you have allies that can attack but they do not actually end the
14735000	14743720	enemies looking at you lego franchise looking at you and they actually don't help at all i don't
14743720	14750040	know if the newest lego star wars they actually do help her is she playing this because she genuinely
14750040	14757880	likes it or is she as a warning to the rest of us avoid this it's my childhood game i do like the
14757880	14764040	game i'm just rubbish at it i i like the navi side i've never played the rda say whoa

14962040	14963160	electricity oh
14966840	14968120	thunder and lighten and maybe
14975560	14977560	okay

14988760	14990760	okay question mark question mark
14992840	14998520	we're saved though that's the fantastic news first voice does not need a second
14999480	15001480	he really
15008040	15011480	we prepare a storm is in the sky
15017080	15024680	we did it na vi na vi na vi we're the best we're the best better than the rest better than the rda
15025480	15027880	let me take a little little drink too
15031080	15036440	congrats on getting second please for na vi any percent lemo let me submit this stream for it why not
15041160	15047480	another game down well uh we're gonna go for a tinkle winkle and i'm gonna make a honey tea
15047480	15057160	because my voice box is dying and then we're gonna do the rda side so don't uh emmy i believe
15057160	15064280	sheebie is playing class of 09 emmy bezu is doing an unlisted unarchived stream so please don't be
15064280	15068280	afraid to go check that out because i'll still be here actually i don't know how long she's gonna go
15068280	15073480	for that maybe i mean if it's four hours to do the rda side it is very rough on the voice to whisper
15073480	15082520	for four hours so hopefully i know boo rda rda hate emmy is making pin pals do math oh no way
15083640	15086840	i think to know if you play as a human you have multiple places where you can betray them
15088600	15092840	hmm what is that like all the way up to the very end
15094840	15099320	because wouldn't i wouldn't i just become a na vi at that point or am i still human
15099720	15106280	you wouldn't i have to do the evil side now unfortunately
15108600	15114840	i think i would ruin the run if i did it i beat the game already literally i think it's
15114840	15120200	four hours for each side yeah there's emmy rda hate but gun and flamethrower fun though
15120200	15123160	then every straight up ask you to switch like three four times oh do they
15124120	15126280	i would know i love gun shoot so i
15132600	15141880	right i'm gonna quickly go peep um and make a cup of tea i highly suggest everyone to stretch
15141880	15148520	your legs don't be afraid to open up any stream the now um i will be roughly three minutes it takes
15148600	15153320	me like three minutes to boil the kettle and tinkle and all of that so please do do fish pee
15153320	15160120	absolutely fish pee all over you right now um please don't be afraid to check out sheebie or
15160120	15165000	emmy um i will be a couple of minutes and then we will jump back into the naughty naughty human
15165000	15175800	side bad human bad human stinky human stinky stinky um but yes please do consider standing up
15175800	15181720	stretching your legs getting yourself a little snacky wacky um and then we'll jump in and you
15181720	15185240	guys have to hold my hands with the game because i am actually genuinely terrified to please swim
15185240	15189080	in all the way through because camera angle is so freaking low to the ground and if i've got big
15189080	15194760	navi running at me i'm actually gonna be scared so yes hopefully this doesn't work i really hope
15194760	15199000	the game doesn't break well i'm gonna wait for like literally three minutes but the game's so old
15199000	15207320	right please do stand up and get some rest okay i need to do this did it work did it work oh yeah
15209000	15219320	okay i go now

15975000	15978000	It's so goofy.
15978000	15983000	It's so goofy.
15983000	15987000	Turning the stream into a dad pun stream, honestly.
15987000	15989000	I love this bit.
15989000	15992000	Well, when you guys do witty comments that I can repeat on stream,
15992000	15997000	I'm literally stealing them and then doing that gag over and over again.
15997000	15999000	I should be straight up to working.
15999000	16003000	Okay, I have to go now. Bye-bye. Bye. Thank you for hanging.
16003000	16005000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16005000	16007000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16007000	16009000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16009000	16011000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16011000	16013000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16013000	16015000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16015000	16017000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16017000	16019000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16019000	16021000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16021000	16023000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16023000	16025000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16025000	16027000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16027000	16029000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16029000	16031000	I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.
16036000	16038000	What do you get when you cross a snowman and a vampire?
16048000	16050000	Why was that so delayed?
16050000	16052000	I don't know why the crickets were so delayed.
16052000	16054500	That was even more embarrassing.
16054500	16056500	That made it worse that the crickets were delayed.
16059000	16067240	All right, you ready for this we're skipping we're skipping
16068600	16071480	Even the crickets aren't having it literally even showing up
16073920	16075920	Eight hours built on the shorter side
16077800	16083040	I'll let you like I've kind of mentioned I weave it, but like going offline after two hours
16083040	16087200	I like sat and was just staring at the screen for a little bit. I was like
16087600	16094120	What do I do now like I've got like an entire day, and I'm not on stream like it felt so weird
16094920	16096920	Like I don't
16097520	16102400	But I reached them a smart collapse type thing, which is really good
16107200	16109200	Our little cheekies are definitely red
16110040	16111520	reporting for duty, sir
16112400	16117960	I think I'm too German for the jokes are the bad they are terrible the jokes are not funny and
16118360	16120360	That is why we we use the
16122720	16124720	Cuz no one's laughing at the joke
16126320	16128320	Honestly it felt weird like
16129160	16133320	I'll every week I do plan in a couple of injured streams
16134360	16140080	But the days that have shorter streams like the two are one like I really enjoyed needy streamer overload
16140080	16143200	I did not expect to enjoy that. I looked up the
16144160	16149640	Ending I would have gotten if I managed to not ignore her and
16151120	16158320	Like she was like ready to become a god and like take down 10% of the world's population and all that and I'm like whoa
16159520	16164840	I so wish I could have gotten that but I messed up too badly, but that's okay. I couldn't have known you know
16165320	16167320	played for the same
16167320	16172280	You know you get none of the squat you go you and none of the squad laughing with that one I giggle
16173320	16176940	You're still sitting on your feet. I am I'm sitting on my right one right now
16176940	16181500	And then the left one is just wiggling the back of the chair. Why do you want to go?
16183280	16185280	Don't abuse
16185320	16187320	What do you say?
16188760	16192440	Niko from undead and what I don't know
16193440	16199740	Think of criss-cross applesauce the way you sit like that, but I'm sitting on my foot like against my
16202960	16209340	Honestly good way to really enjoy streams of you because I constantly like wiggle and move my legs type thing
16209340	16211340	I
16217180	16221980	They're putting pressure on moving them like cuz cuz I'm sitting on my foot. There's pressure against it
16221980	16223980	So it's like keeping the station
16224900	16228180	You get a little ground out of us a little mouth curve
16228180	16234620	Oh, yeah, did I have the ability to make you put air out your nose a little just a little bit faster?
16235620	16237620	Yeah, I'm thinking
16238340	16241900	Crouched no, I'm not I'm not crouching. I'm like sitting on them this time
16241900	16245140	But I do go on crouch on the chair sometimes
16245780	16251900	Like I was having to send all I was talking to like eight people at once trying to organize something for the girls
16251900	16254580	And I was golem crouched on my chair
16255380	16260860	Because I was trying to like get it done so fast so I could go to bed because I was exhausted
16261660	16267140	I'm like trying to like send this to an editor and upload these files over here and send them off and get the link and make sure
16267140	16268900	It's a pretty like oh
16268900	16270660	so
16270660	16272660	Yeah
16278260	16282260	Although they attacked me when I'm Navi as well, so honestly just a wee bit deserve
16282700	16284700	Oh
16288860	16292260	These things are indestructible honestly
16294620	16297260	Should unplug my mouse and keyboard right now just looking
16300380	16304420	I'm not even paying attention honestly, I should but
16304940	16306940	I
16307220	16313900	Think you could probably xp farm here if you had the tolerance for it because you're getting 50 every time and my
16314420	16316420	It says I need
16316420	16318420	1600 xp to level up
16318580	16321780	So yeah, that's the pretty big xp form
16323500	16325000	Ow
16325000	16327000	my angst
16327540	16332220	You're like I got paid to side with the humans. Okay, I got this is

16344740	16349820	Fucking hell, you're not supposed to say that part out loud. That's supposed to be an inside thought
16352340	16356540	Absolutely just got annihilated. Oh my I don't even know if I can come back from that. Oh
16357740	16359740	That was brutal
16360300	16362700	I can't even come back from that. I
16363940	16366540	Got 10 xp from driving over that plan
16368500	16370420	Literally
16370420	16375300	Okay, the dogs don't get like perish from the bungee
16376740	16379820	Which is fine carried by the Scottish
16381380	16383380	Literally

16427380	16430100	Cuz you're just jealous. Oh
16431060	16433260	My gosh, I don't like it. I don't like it
16435500	16439940	I'm sure they were probably win some when I was Navi, but it's everything feels so meaner
16439940	16441940	I

16493060	16498100	Why do I not have unlimited ammo? That's a bit of a problem. I heard that
16502500	16510380	I don't see like cuz the camera angle is like way smaller cuz I am smaller as well makes Pandora like even scarier
16513060	16515060	Hmm
16516180	16518180	The accuracy of our drugs
16523060	16525060	Hey
16525340	16527340	That is unbelievable
16527620	16533220	But that no, it's comedically slow that reverse considering how fast and a
16534340	16536020	What's the word?
16536020	16539020	Motion sickness and just in the forward spring now
16539540	16545820	I've unlocked a grenade launcher. Okay. Maybe maybe mucking around with the weapons would be such a terrible idea
16546980	16550140	Trooper pack unlocked some sort of blaze
16551140	16558780	Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. I'm just driving through here. Then you mean me. No, I'm not looking for any trouble. No

16573540	16577340	To keep myself from harm the poor people
16578300	16580300	Are burning in the sun

16594300	16596300	Then the buggy out of nowhere
16604220	16606220	No way
16607500	16614020	Old military set of gearbox don't want to go backwards only forwards towards dying enemy
16616140	16621300	This is like a flashback right now. Oh, can you like see the music video in your head as I'm talking about it?
16622420	16627940	Can I put images in your head if I talk about things? Oh my god, I never even spoke about that
16628500	16633220	So I can't like see things in my head the way others can like the way it's just like I can't do that
16633340	16636180	So if I say things does it appear in your head?
16637980	16639980	Ah
16641580	16646400	Sometimes okay, okay, I'm totally not gonna use that
16648060	16650060	Against you at any point
16653020	16657180	Can I do a music videos I am now making you think of
16658260	16664180	The gorillas music video where noodles is dancing in that room and then the guy
16664540	16670140	Has a big head and it goes never did no harm never did no harm
16682780	16687980	Wait, it's all the wrong one, I don't know one of them the giant head literally it was just a man
16687980	16691860	I saw the comments and someone was like that a key Joe
16692500	16699700	Honestly his jaw. So, um, if you ever take the recreational
16700500	16703820	and also known as bebex to say and
16705060	16709820	That makes your jaw clench or something along that line and
16710820	16712060	so
16712060	16715300	In scott's you say like all his jaw was spinning
16716140	16718580	or like he's got an achy jaw and
16718860	16720180	And
16720180	16723820	Like the comments were all saying that and we'll watch it back and I was like, oh, wow
16725180	16730340	Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I'm just a signal specialist. I'm looking for a fight. Excuse me. Excuse me
16730340	16733580	No, no, I didn't want to fight leave me alone. Get me in the boat. Get me in the boat
16734380	16737540	Jeez Titanic all over again. Get me in that boat. Oh
16739060	16741940	I forgot it's just a little more down here. It's dare
16743340	16745860	Do you know the song from grills kids with guns? Oh
16746860	16754340	No, sorry, I thought you're referencing that music video. I know the what's that other one? I really like humility
16755260	16757260	I don't want no
16757460	16759460	Isolation
16759460	16762260	You see say I'm in now
16767460	16771580	Unfortunately, I don't know the words very well like I never oh, I'm just jumping most of them except in all these
16771580	16774740	I've unlocked a nail gun veteran pack. I
16775340	16781540	Can call in a motor strike hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. This is actually maybe I admit
16781540	16787260	It's a little bit cool. I'll definitely keep zoom because it keeps me away significantly increased damage
16789820	16791900	Oh, but that one's
16795060	16799940	Calling an airstrike destroying every enemy and be aware it takes a few seconds for the strike to arrive
16800340	16806460	Maybe just defense I think defense speed and health to get me out of there and whatever the last one was
16807100	16812440	Invisibility and zoom get me out of whatever situation I'm in the video with Jack black
16817020	16825380	Yeah, yeah, so I'm about to go full fortune it's on the nappy. I don't know what fortune this one is but
16826300	16832180	Hot hot take coming in. Oh, I don't like the gorillas. Oh, yeah, that's okay. You don't have to like everything
16833460	16837580	Some things are for some people and some things aren't for some people that is how the world work
16837580	16843380	I don't think anyone should be punished. However, if you don't like Assassin's Creed brotherhood, then I will happily
16843940	16845940	Put you in either
16845940	16848300	Mercy's basement or she bees

16857780	16862940	Um, we have successfully finished the nappy side of this game
16863260	16870320	We are now purposely joining the RDA, which I have never actually played before but we are still in the tutorial section
16870320	16873500	So I know what comes up ahead like it's not a big deal or anything like that
16874020	16876020	and I
16876460	16878460	Prepare a paranoid myself

16899020	16902780	Remain just noisy. Whoa, where's the print? Whoa. Whoa. You can't be doing this one
16903700	16909300	That's not fair. You know like to take me when I'm not prepared. Okay. That's not fair
16910060	16914580	That's cheat see doodling don't cheat see doodle. Okay, Dr. Harper. I presume

16931700	16936220	Then we'll get along just fine now, please go and assist
16937060	16938260	Oh
16938260	16944780	It's gonna be so weird doing the RDA side you listen noob. I need you to grab me some florist
16944780	16950020	Listen noob. You ain't afraid of a few carnivorous plants. Are you aren't afraid of a flower among friends?
16950860	16957980	We aren't friends. Oh, you need to learn quick. Okay. Jeez. Lois. Talk about being unfriendly around these part
16958340	16962700	Make her blush for every bad joke of today's stream. Honestly, it's been pretty rough
16962700	16968300	Right if I remember correctly, there's literally
16969180	16973900	Yeah, um, okay. I've just noticed that we have infinite ammo on this gun
16974740	16976740	One that's not how they work
16976820	16978260	to
16978260	16986340	Actually, it's a wee bit of a pet peeve the one all we should watch those Keanu Reeve movies because they have the ammo reload thing, correct
16987100	16992000	And how am I trying to say it like in movies where they just like
16992500	16998300	With a pistol and like pistol literally have seven max like if you're talking like the M7 or something like that
16998300	17000500	Why where the enemies I can hear them. Oh
17004100	17007860	Well, I did ask to see them and I can see them loud and clear
17008540	17011060	Jeez the camp. I'm stuck on something. Oh
17011660	17017180	Jesus, I need I need some space. I need some space in order to like actually shoot please game
17018100	17021820	If you're not gonna give me aim assist at least let me fricking shoot
17025700	17030460	They sound like buzzle gum from Viva Pinata, it's almost like they're based after flies
17030460	17032460	Why
17037380	17039300	Johnson the Baba Yaga
17039300	17045380	Wic. Yes, that one we should watch those because I like how they're actually accurate with the goons
17047620	17055580	It's very nice that they're accurate with the reading. I love the way John Wic uses reloads to set the case for gun face
17055580	17057580	I don't know you'll notice that that's true
17060580	17062580	Unlimited ammo and mass effect
17066100	17068100	Someone said I might like mass effect
17068940	17073660	I've actually never played the series before but some said I might like it. I
17074580	17076580	Know he's called Sheppard
17077340	17081180	That's about it. Oh, no, I don't need to do that at all. I'm getting confused
17082420	17088740	All the John Wick movies are good. Yeah, speaking of John Wick. Have you played cyberpunk? No, I haven't I watch
17089220	17091220	Shia cyberpunk
17091700	17093700	but I am
17094300	17099780	I am still absolutely heartbroken about Rebecca. I am so sorry. Is it
17101100	17103900	Her name is Rebecca. What's the name of the?
17105220	17106820	The cyber
17106820	17109180	You're over the rainbow here. Is it Lucy?
17109620	17116740	Is it Rebecca and Lucy like brotherhood? I'm getting brotherhood. That's awesome screw brother. Wait, it is Rebecca and Lucy
17117740	17120460	What are the odds that assassin creep brotherhood and
17121660	17123660	cyberpunk the anime I
17124180	17129100	Am I am heartbroken over Rebecca? I'm so sorry. I'm gonna see something so controversial
17129180	17132540	I have no comprehension no
17133340	17139140	Comprehension on how Rebecca just doesn't auto win like people like all this see this
17140140	17141780	Lucy
17141900	17148940	Lucy are you can you open your eyes and look at how perfect Rebecca is? I'll actually tell you some more development notes and
17149900	17151900	You don't have Rebecca's voice
17152780	17159380	And on the concept of I see obviously I see before I see you know applied and all of that
17159620	17162820	We actually were quite happy to give I see to
17163980	17169740	Someone like that may have had a deeper voice because of Rebecca from cyberpunk. So that's a fun
17170260	17173580	Behind-the-scenes and I am not over Rebecca my first
17175020	17177020	Trigger I
17177060	17181220	Actually, I'm interested in potentially cosplaying her for an ace more stream
17181220	17185460	And I think that would be a hoot and holler and I won't show my face
17185940	17187940	I'd not
17188140	17190140	I'm not for that and
17190860	17192860	But I'm happy to do like
17193340	17194540	a
17194540	17196540	Nick down
17196860	17204180	I'm good to sip of my honey tea to see if it's a sip but yeah, I don't know Lucy everyone arguing about Rebecca and Lucy
17204180	17208180	I'm like, how is anyone looking at Lucy Rebecca's just peak like design everything
17212420	17218140	You know, it's a really sad detail if you haven't seen the cyberpunk anime close your ears for about two minutes
17219140	17224300	And after no, no, I need to say this part out loud close your ears for two minutes
17224300	17229500	If you don't want spoilers about cyberpunk the anime the really sad fact is that Rebecca
17229940	17231940	Got an upgrade to her hands
17232380	17239700	after her brother died to the the crazy guy because of the blowback she got from the shotgun
17239780	17246780	She never gets any root ricochet from shotguns anymore after that fact after that scene and it's such a sad fact
17246780	17248780	But yeah, and
17249460	17252720	Anyway, sorry back to the camp back to the actual gameplay
17254100	17256100	I'm just really passionate
17256780	17259980	The cyber cycle. Yeah, so the cyber cycle takes out her brother
17259980	17265940	But in that scene she shoots a shotgun at him and she goes backwards and then after that moment her
17266740	17273820	Her hand upgrades come in like her fisty cuffs and she never experiences recoil when shooting weaponry
17274220	17276220	And it's all because of that incident
17276780	17278780	And it's so sad
17279180	17283100	But her design is just beautiful. Absolutely beautiful
17284980	17286980	Let me drink my tea
17289100	17294420	The recoil so a little background on Rebecca studio trigger was asked to change her because
17294860	17297980	Her design was too lollipop a trigger went now lollipops these
17299420	17301660	Rebecca definitely influenced I see
17302580	17309540	Creation with the hips area and the legs. I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise a peak design. Sorry I
17311900	17317340	Knew from the get-go. I wanted a troupe a tan, which is what Emy was and then I see
17318340	17319660	and
17319660	17321660	It's not true pattern
17321660	17329260	but and but I did want her to have like the thickness of Rebecca basically it is I mean
17329260	17331260	I'm happy to talk about development. I know it's and
17331660	17336860	Like a Zura. We knew we wanted a chocolate and thick. So we've got a goddess and
17337820	17342540	Yeah, we just took it from there. Obviously. Um, sorry, let me finish this to you. Oh
17347300	17349300	Yeah
17350900	17357460	Adam Sandler said you look like a cut of me. Are you wait in the game? I'm pretty sure that's from the game
17357460	17359460	I'm sure I've seen a clip of that game
17361660	17363660	Coming down with the
17365700	17369340	I'll actually tell you some other developmental notes, you know, if I had a lighter voice
17370780	17372620	a me
17372620	17376380	Amie's design and every in lore and everything if I had a lighter voice
17377140	17379140	I
17380020	17382020	Would death will be a
17382020	17384660	I would death will reflect if I had a lighter voice
17384660	17389700	But unfortunately I don't and so, you know, I take like the the big sister look approach
17392620	17399940	Yeah, don't be surprised if it an alternative outfits, so I look a bit more true to myself and I am
17402420	17404900	I suppose I'm a Rebecca. How tall is Rebecca?
17406260	17410300	No, I do it in centimeters. Don't give me freedom units. I can't do freedom units
17411500	17417820	But I guess Rebecca's really very reflective. I think that's probably why I'm gravitated towards her so much as well
17418820	17421700	Because I'm just like hey, like I just love her
17423100	17427540	I'm gonna leave for the night. So here's your bro teeth brushing. Yes. Thank you

17862940	17870460	Literally, I thought they were just gonna recycle all of the maps, but this is like an entirely new side of the game
17870460	17874560	I know this sounds so silly, but I just assumed the recycle the maps and like oh
17875900	17877900	I'm claiming that all right

18134520	18136520	But if it's bad for me
18140360	18145200	Well, it's a lamp in the Navy so brave. I'm sorry. I'm so bad at this like
18147760	18153760	Mmm, you're having a sip of my chocolate milkshake. Yes, I'm actually having a chocolate milk shake at 9 a.m
18153760	18155760	And then nothing you can do about it
18159640	18164880	Is it cold you bet your ass it's cold because that guy was sitting at a flipping restaurant for ages
18165960	18169640	Okay, um, I would tab out to read any
18170480	18176160	Marshmallows, however the game breaks when I do that. So I'm just gonna read chat and munch away
18177520	18183880	So, please if you don't like munching sounds and he's live. She's live, but me I'm a munching your ears
18188280	18190920	I'm having a beer at 7 a.m. I

18215600	18217360	Okay
18217360	18222960	Hopefully I don't mess up too many times actually doing the RDA campaign, but I have to admit
18222960	18226960	It's like terrifying. I had no I thought the maps were gonna be the same and I was like, okay
18226960	18229920	At least the maps are the same and I'm familiar with the past. Nope
18231640	18233640	Mmm
18234320	18238200	I don't they apparently sold 2.7 million copies of this game
18239040	18245000	Yeah, that seems really low for like any game. I feel like that. Does that mean it full-option?
18249360	18254000	Mm-hmm, I'm gonna inspire people to get a McDonald's breakfast at this rate
18257080	18259080	You it
18260080	18266320	A little hard in America they do 24 hour breakfast, so I'm jealous. I have to admit
18274840	18278360	You still think the tips are slightly broken or you're getting limited. Oh
18281040	18283040	Hmm
18283880	18285880	I'm not sure
18286200	18287440	That
18287440	18292240	Last tip did come through I wonder why that would be maybe reach every region locked
18293720	18295960	No, that seems silly, that's the answer I
18298120	18303440	Don't like break I don't like the breakfast menu of most fast food places rather try it for me menus on
18305800	18312480	I know it sounds weird, but I love to make some nuggies a salad and put them both together and
18313200	18316880	Wheatwrap and yogurt that just sounds like a
18317880	18319360	and
18319360	18322080	What's that Greek thing? Where's the chicken in a wrap?
18323040	18326240	I've completely not kebab, but like it's on different

18382680	18386000	Or should I be like, I can grasp your names Jeff because it sounds like Jeff I
18388840	18394960	Don't comprehend where Jeff came from unless it was from non native English speakers. That's the only like and
18395960	18402920	Thingy, I don't know why it is a thing. Obviously. It's funny in internet culture, but why is it Jeff?
18403960	18405960	I know Jeff literally
18409960	18414240	My name is Jeff I feels good man. I'm sorry

18427880	18434320	It's called pray mark, but folks say it pre mark and the folk that say it pre mark
18434320	18436820	I'm talking to you right now directly
18437320	18441920	Do you say primary school or do you say primary school?

18458340	18460340	I don't know why
18461180	18463780	It's a debate and the UK
18464620	18466180	Pray Murray
18466180	18472100	It's the same one pre mark noise. No, it's pray mark primary school pray mark
18472740	18475340	Hi to all marks. Yeah. Hi mark. Hi
18476420	18478420	Congrats if you names mark
18479140	18482300	Also, Jeff is a peanut butter company. Is it
18494620	18495980	Okay
18495980	18497980	our peanut butter and
18498140	18500860	And jelly sandwiches actually is tasty as
18501740	18507980	American movies make it out to be because all kids unanimously in TV shows have a PB and J
18508260	18512440	Is it actually that good or is it being hyped up as I choke on my food?
18518500	18523660	It's a comfort food. Yes, it's okay. She seems to think so. Okay. She be's word is law
18524220	18529320	Yes, it's overhyped. Yes. It's an acquired taste. It's good yet. PB and J is good
18529940	18532860	They can't be it's okay. Diabetes in a sandwich
18533380	18535380	I
18535620	18539620	Absolutely, they're a good tree. Okay. It's a tree kind of not like a everyday thing
18541300	18544980	Mmm, I skipped the jelly and only the peanut bar
18547020	18549020	I've tried the jar ones it's
18549540	18551540	Pretty okay, but just okay
18551820	18555780	It's a thing they are raised on so as a result. They love it. Mmm. I
18556740	18561860	Suppose like iron brews my example if you don't drink iron brews a kid, you'll never have a taste for it
18562860	18564860	It's so bizarre and flavor
18566220	18568220	It's like that and
18568860	18570860	Japanese natto
18571300	18573300	fermented soybeans is a breakfast thing
18574380	18577020	apparently if you are a back-of-guy gene and
18578060	18584060	You like it's really hard to enjoy natto unless you like force yourself to eat it over a while and then you get used to that
18586140	18588900	Yeah, like it's hard it's hard to get into it. Mmm
18589860	18594700	Remember the old commercial from it made from
18596060	18598060	Gerders
18599980	18602420	It's cheap as heck and that's why we eat it so much
18603420	18607620	I've had peanut butter toast and banana and it's delicious. It's very nice
18607740	18614500	What's iron brews supposed to taste like they advertise it as ginger and bubblegum and it tastes like battery acid that's only
18614980	18616140	explicable
18616140	18621620	Way that you can see what that orange liquid tastes like it's battery acid, but nice
18624060	18626060	Mmm
18628700	18631820	Literally mountain juice is the closest you'll ever get to it
18632980	18638060	That is just not positive. Sorry. I'm trying to eat and talk and I want to eat the food as fast as possible
18638060	18640700	So I'm not holding up the gameplay too much. Hmm. I
18641660	18643660	Take a drink from my chucky milkshake
18646940	18652940	Hmm, they forgot to give me a straw. So I'm literally just drinking out of it like some animal
18656460	18660780	Hmm, do you see mountain dew? Yes, I said mountain dew
18663660	18665660	Oh dude, no
18666300	18670940	Mountain dew, mountain dew, mountain dew. Whoa, that's so close
18671580	18675180	Mountain dew. Whoa, you can't tell the difference when I say that
18676300	18678300	Oh, that's crazy. Mountain dew
18679180	18682140	Whoa, it sounds like I'm saying Jay, but I'm no
18683100	18685100	I'm saying you
18685740	18687740	Oh, that's so cool
18689660	18693020	Did you drink my manju? Oh, that's weird
18695660	18700940	Mmm, okay, I didn't know I said I like that because I'm here now literally
18701900	18703900	Did you drink my manju?
18704860	18708300	Wow, why does it sound like that? I can hear it. No, do you
18709740	18712460	Did you drink my mountain dew?
18714220	18716220	Dew
18718380	18721100	Yeah, I've tried manju. I don't think it tastes like I'm brutal
18721100	18727180	No, but it's it's only the closest thing. It's a German. I feel not good here. Monka is bro
18727180	18729180	Love
18732780	18740700	To do a drop of dew and a dew gets all the same pronunciation
18749900	18751900	You now have a new earworm enjoy
18752860	18758620	All right, I've got two more nuggies left and then I've got this like uh burger mcgrittle thingy
18758620	18762860	I don't know what it's called. It's called mcmuffin. That's what we call it mcmuffin, but I think it's called mcgrittle
18766940	18770460	Mountain dew was originally made to be a mixer for whiskey
18774060	18777340	I don't know when I'm gonna do my first like drunk stream
18778300	18782700	I'm down for drunk karaoke, but I would have to rest my voice a day before
18785260	18790540	I was very nervous about it like the first time I ever did it, but now I know that
18791500	18794380	I'm not hitting them notes. So I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna send it
18794620	18796620	Mmm
18804780	18811580	The original coca-cola had cocaine in it. Honestly, I just know that
18813500	18816940	It would just have been such a good time to be drinking that stuff, you know what I'm saying
18817420	18819420	I
18820940	18829660	I'm sure I learned as well that um, what did I learn that they used to prescribe like um
18831500	18836140	I was a heroine they used to prescribe that if you were feeling rough back in the day
18839180	18842860	The drunk stream would give a hundred percent a hundred out of hand barb, I'm sorry
18843420	18850860	Here in brazil come to brazil many restaurants serve nuggets with creamy cheese or green green sauce
18851260	18854540	What would green sauce consist of would be some sort of veggie blended up
18856460	18858460	I would do cheese sauce definitely
18860300	18862300	Sorry, I'm looking my fingers like an animal
18866060	18871100	Most of the nasty addictive drugs started as medicines honestly like they were just having a good time back then
18871980	18876300	I just choked. Um, I don't know if you've ever heard about this guy called Sigmund Freud
18877020	18882140	He was absolutely wild and with his theories, but he was also highly addicted to
18882940	18884780	and um
18884780	18891660	Like a lot of his stuff got discredited, but like as time progresses he gets proven right again and again
18892060	18894060	Um

18998140	19001260	Like that's not even worth 12 dollars. I'm like, oh, okay

19072300	19077580	I think I'm confusing it with pepsi. I genuinely can't remember if I've ever tried dr. Pepper if it's an american thing
19081180	19085340	Oh, you're playing that climbing game. I remember the thumbnail
19087660	19092220	Because we had your skirt was open so we had to close your skirt
19094460	19100380	Honestly, maybe that should be a toggle for you. No, I'm not. Maybe we should toggle that so you don't have to worry
19106220	19111340	Dr. Pepper isn't the okay. I've just never tasted it before literally i'm brewing cola

19135580	19139100	Then you can accidentally toggle on and off and stream true
19142140	19145020	The only person who worries for receiving followers aim
19147020	19154060	Dr. Pepper taste dr. Pepper taste kind of cola with with mint mint mint fizzy juice
19154860	19158460	I'm not sure mint fizzy juice is gonna go down well with me. I do apologize

19214060	19215420	Hmm
19215420	19222060	The guys see the online discourse about the ingredients in like american food versus like any other country
19222620	19224620	And like so much stuff has been banned

19251180	19252300	Hmm

19295180	19298860	Actually, you know what's even sadder about the kinder egg ban the new realize
19299500	19301500	The only reason those children
19301900	19308220	Hmm past because of the kinder egg was because their parents weren't even paying attention to them
19308860	19310860	Which is such a wee shame like it's
19313100	19315100	Um
19317900	19319900	They have to ban it
19320060	19325580	Instead of being like hey here public announcement pay attention to your little ones because we didn't know

19327100	19329100	little ones explore
19329660	19335340	Using their mouth. That's why you can imagine literally licking any surface because you did it as a wee babby
19335340	19338140	It's an exploratory thing. You you learned so much from it
19339420	19341420	Like for example if I tell you
19342140	19345980	Uh to imagine what it's like licking a cold pole with rain

20007740	20009740	And then we'll go just forward. Okay
20010940	20016540	Easy easy on the tilt. Why are you it's literally tilting me? I don't know why insist on tilting
20018060	20024540	Squishy human versus navi with their carbon fiber reinforced bones. Honestly. Oh my god. I just missed the helipad as well
20025420	20029660	Oh, let me sit then get get me out of that. I'm gonna vomit if I'm in that any longer

20040620	20043340	I'm holding on good girl. Wait. Why are we thinking?
20047260	20049500	Must be because everything wants to hurt you here
20052620	20054620	Wounded our inbound
20059420	20064060	How's the game so far we've completed the navi and we're doing the bad bad human side now
20064460	20069260	I'm going to keep this simple, but I don't know what to expect. I'm pretty scared of that because I've never played this side
20070460	20073340	This project starts with you our signal specialist
20074300	20078060	This is the sector you're currently in. We need you to go to these three ports
20078860	20083820	Once there you must collect small shards of unobtainment. Oh, right. So we're literally doing
20085020	20087020	Directly the opposite. I mean that makes sense
20089340	20096300	But right now just get those three unobtainium shards. Don't worry too much about the details, writer. We don't have a lot of time
20097180	20099180	Okay
20099980	20101980	Good Falco out. You heard the man

20108300	20115260	Uh, honestly, I'm like leveling up so much. I don't know I can call in I've got weapons up for it as well
20117740	20119740	It's trying to hate humans
20124380	20126380	We are not humans
20126780	20129260	And you make it a lot harder for yourself than it has to be
20129820	20130860	Hey
20130860	20137020	Look, I'm no very smart. Okay. All right. I think that one will have full health. Where am I? Am I flying? Oh, I'm it's a flying
20138220	20145180	That has to be flying. There's no way I can do that on foot. Sorry. There's no way right. Who's ready to get motion sick me?
20147340	20152460	Okay, let's first turn to the first wait woman's closest. Yeah, that one is closest
20153340	20157900	Okay, first let's get hate so we don't bump into the walls or anything
20158860	20162780	Is this the ceiling of the game is wow, we're already at the ceiling. Okay, uh

20193900	20199260	I can see transport over here, which makes me think it's safe to put down the chopper here
20200140	20206380	I don't know if that's true, but we'll try it. Oh my god. We're about to go against navi for the first
20207020	20209020	Oh my god, that's horrifying

21171220	21176220	yet all in good time right now we need to upload that harmonic pop it into the
21176220	21185180	module and let's see what we've got okay sure here we go what's happening now what's
21185180	21190420	all this stuff for doc yes let me explain the knobby have a unique relationship with
21190420	21196660	the plan using a sacred site they're able to link directly with the ecosystem it's
21196660	21201100	how they communicate with the entire so we're searching for something different
21201100	21206540	our research there is another site that can help us sever the knobby community
21206540	21215020	con already has my joy stick place the knobby call the well if we can find this
21215020	21218540	old this is why they aren't letting you name any more car honestly I know as a
21219260	21226900	I'll never live down from the liberal but honestly best name this is where your harmonics
21226900	21232580	come in right we don't know where this dormant site is hi so the harmonic helps you find its
21232580	21237460	location I'm actually enjoying these cutscenes because I've never seen them before we can
21237460	21243060	triangulate the precise location of the dormant well of soul okay now let's see what your first

21303380	21309940	Monroe mentioned that what is this emulator you stay focused on your mission writer you start
21309940	21317300	growing the conscience and you'll end up on the dead end of a knobby spear dismiss okay okay falcon
21317300	21326020	is your travel to fable hmm that's where they made different maps reach when I genuinely assumed
21326020	21332740	it was just gonna be recycled I can't believe it I'm surprised but we've picked up one song so we need
21333540	21338980	two more songs and then I assume the third we destroy it or the navi destroy it before we get
21338980	21347220	it so it's like literally a complete hundred I could flip yeah words and stuff um hello please

21418180	21420980	kind of sad they put so much effort into it didn't get much traction
21424340	21427780	I think in 2.7 million sales you made your money back though
21429380	21437220	so investors can't feel too bad I think I don't know if like avatar because when the

21973540	21982260	with the least amount of spikes as possible and the game has aged a little bit in terms of like
21982260	21986180	I don't know what they were thinking these camera angles and stuff why does that look like it's
21986180	21991780	gonna wallop down on me as I go past it I saw that I can that is horrific I've not seen that

22271940	22276900	thing I don't know what the heck it does I feel like it's gonna slam down on me and I just want to

22386340	22386900	level up
22390340	22394340	if that hammerhead taught us anything is that you ain't got enough damage for bosses

23892820	23900340	sure there are lots of sections of everything in vampires the masquerade and destroy all humans
23900340	23907380	have hypnosis wait vampires masquerade do you get to play as a vampire that hypnotizes people that
23907380	23915460	would be kind of cool oh my god I'm here for that oh okay I feel like we level up so fast
23915460	23923460	this rda maybe the rda isn't as long I think so oh that's so cool maybe we'll take a look at that
23923460	23929700	I've never played it or seen any gameplay of it but uh is that like a highly rated game
23932020	23939860	dark souls 3 has rapport for anime potential I suppose I mean technically more door shadow
23939860	23946980	and more door you can take technically like imprint enemies so they're not mean to you all right
23946980	23951860	upload the harmonic I'm behind on my doomsday diagnostic this is the second song wrong with the
23951860	23957860	emulator we could have an ecological meltdown okay let's hold up a sec what the hell is this emulator
23959060	23964580	yes the emulator we're searching for a dormant well of souls right now once we find it we need to
23964580	23971460	communicate oh they're pretending being called a first voice he's the only person who can awake
23971460	23980180	in a well of souls they're pretending that the emulator isn't just a nuke once that's done
23980260	23986820	we can control the entire ecosystem so back to that first ecosystem you're going to do a diagnostic
23987620	23993700	well hey everything has its risk come now upload that harm they're lying to me not
23995220	23999620	but we're still going to nuke the planet anyway once they're closer depending on the location of
23999620	24004500	the dormant site you should check in with the man who doesn't in fact have the option to be a hypnotic
24005460	24009620	and highly rated as a question it's a cult classic oh my apology I did not know that
24014900	24021540	it's good might need to mess with it a little to make it work though it's an old game oh yeah
24021540	24026740	doesn't Baldur's Gate have a bunch of them I'm not playing Big Baldi's Gate yet

24032500	24038500	you guys in and out or is it another kind of corp the human colony and avatar is pretty impressive
24038820	24043540	that emulators are one hope Baldur's Gate has tons of main controls especially because main
24043540	24048980	flyers are a big part of the plot hmm doesn't have main control of the game
24050580	24057940	it's quite a vtm vampire's masquerades old game it's not that kind of cool one we're going to

24650980	24657060	r.i.p. I can't believe it it's such a legendary game I can't even say I recommend like I'll go out and
24657060	24662900	buy it it's the experiences for me is more nostalgia although this part is like actually
24663780	24666740	like I'm actually like having a challenge playing this part
24668500	24674820	I'm still in disbelief the game even exists your hands are on the controller
24674820	24679380	be like didn't sell the third oh the jet didn't see the turret sorry it's on
24684100	24690900	you're doing good I've got two songs I think so far
24693860	24698580	I'm sure by the way you missed the cutscene gate flying like a rocket launcher honestly
24699860	24707060	yeah you leveled so far I wonder if the rda mission is actually like smaller than the main
24708580	24715220	wait I want to unlock the fast travel before takeoff just in case level up

24752180	24754740	what's the what's the deal did I just go for it
24755620	24762660	it's just an XP run I think it's just an XP run I'll just destroy everything
24765860	24770500	oh my gosh oh no
24774980	24780340	oh that's getting that's all out of my head that's too loud for stream
24780660	24784500	oh that's like just a little deafening
24786500	24789860	okay this just looks like an XP farm run I'm gonna say it but
24791700	24793940	I can't even see what's ahead of me there's so much
24797780	24806340	oh oh excuse me oh no whoa I don't even know you're just riding those like that
24806820	24811620	oh what's going on what's going on

24820500	24825540	the camera angle is like I'm not even driving who's driving this warthog
24826420	24832900	did a terrible job of it um overheating oops hold on
24832980	24839060	over here and I'm getting a little too overzealous with this weaponry okay
24847380	24851700	this is just annihilation I'm starting to feel bad for the navi like as much as they're annoying
24851700	24854900	when they're trying to kill me damn it engine won't start
24855620	24866180	oh as they hold them off where I can't see oh god they're everywhere
24873540	24875300	oh I don't know if I'm going to make this alive
24878180	24880020	I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying
24880020	24883300	hard
24887460	24889460	oh my goodness
24890980	24896820	can I see oh it's a blue plan I keep thinking it's a navi it's a blue plan
24899940	24907060	come on start the car there's only so much back and forth I can do before we actually perish
24907140	24907620	seriously
24910020	24912900	oh my goodness right it seems like they're just falling back and
24913540	24915380	thank good right don't do that again
24919220	24922260	I'm sorry I yelled at you sweetheart he says to the car
24924980	24927380	reflinges I'm sorry I yelled at you sweetheart
24928900	24932660	I just get stressed when I'm playing the bad guys and everything's all skewed
24932660	24934900	and I'm sorry if I skewed
24942340	24943700	oh I don't want that to break
24946900	24948420	she's doing her best for humanity
24950500	24955060	absolutely denying it denying it sorry destroying it
24958980	24960180	if I'm getting xp
24963060	24966900	the first things are running away
24972580	24976820	that's my car that's small that's one of more guys my oh I even know
24979700	24985860	oh first things I just feel bad I feel like we're we're entering a zoo and then just executing
24985860	24991460	all the animals inside the zoo this is what this run feels like honestly
24993220	24994980	like they're literally running away now
25001060	25003940	oh for xp so I can unlock a new armor why not
25010100	25011220	perish that plan
25013380	25014740	in front are you don't oh
25017540	25018580	is that supposed to happen
25022900	25028660	what a unique game mode to say the least I think you see about three of these guys
25028660	25033620	if you play navi and you see 100 on this one section of the game alone
25039540	25041300	we're strum beast pulling
25043140	25046100	it's what it's been oh my god that was
25048020	25052020	that was a slaughter I'm not even happy with that that was awful
25052820	25059300	you're a lifesaver you're a lifesaver how about that strike stubby stakes all around okay the
25059300	25065540	second shards right in this sector go grab it and report back to me and the third I'm working on it
25065540	25070260	radios are toast everything slower here this is why the navi section has so few human
25071140	25079940	campaign colors them now you know why you don't see them in this oh is it like all this damage
25079940	25082900	has been done and we're just coming at the back end of it
25085220	25088260	oh that actually makes so much sense
25091460	25096260	and we're basic we basically come in when they're like at the end of the losing fight and we turn
25096260	25108260	the tide okay oh my god that's so smart I didn't give the devs team like as much benefit as a doubt
25108340	25109220	but that's so smart
25112420	25116660	don't let him I was gonna say don't let him kill you because he's gonna aggro to me and I can just tell
25116660	25122020	you is oh wait hold on where I'm trying to go hold on a minute let me pick
25123860	25130900	there we go I'll just let him get in the back thing what new drift would be got um wait I think
25130900	25134820	we're about to unlock the new one because now our arms are on show and I'm like that's the opposite
25134820	25141540	of what our it does the hero maybe oh no clue if it's kind of it's just a joke of mine I mean it
25141540	25149540	maybe because literally you only see two of them right where we need to go well I'm taking a car
25149540	25159860	for that I'm not taking that back thing can I drive this oh can draw how do I shoot I don't know
25159940	25165940	can I drive him over oh that was I was actually really mean I shouldn't have come up I kind of
25165940	25170420	deserved it what are all those things are those reports
25172980	25180660	um so can I not shoot I don't think I can I think I can only drive we're driving this buggy
25181220	25186980	oh that's like such a long way to go I'll go on the outskirts to get the
25189860	25195060	uh like uncovered map thing actually smash them against the wall
25196900	25199620	oh I can't go that way
25202020	25207540	this is so much more responsive than the buggy I have to admit I like that they make that differentiation
25211220	25218500	uh okay we can't go this way I thought we couldn't come through the way the map made it look but we
25219380	25232980	no I did not just do that oh I did not just do that oh I freaking did oh no no no hello game oh my gosh
25233380	25240340	oh this is the worst thing that could have happened has not happened
25241700	25248500	door stuck literally door stuck oh and I have to do all of this on foot whilst everything is aggressive
25248500	25254900	to me right how much further do I have to go just a wee bit for it just down the street
25254900	25259300	it's fine I just need to pop down the street it's like going to the corner shop it's just around
25259380	25266980	the corner it's okay you can just teleport down I can't because I've not unlocked whatever it is
25266980	25275780	it's not unlocked is it quiet is it safe question mark other than the fly trap
25277380	25283860	just a wee bit more all is good this is called sniper's point implying that they're
25283860	25292180	sniper navi looking at me right now question mark the ho hum okay whoa whoa whoa something's
25292180	25300500	getting me I don't want a fly a fly got me a mosquito a mosquito got me oh whoa look at it freaking
25300500	25307700	ready to like get me all right I'll wait until my inverse comes back yeah yeah that's right go
25307700	25315060	back to sleep give me a stinky stinky plant don't like you abandoned rda camp well that doesn't
25315700	25321780	that doesn't this is this this is not good for me I can tell you that much this is absolutely
25321780	25327940	awful for me um I will take the teleport point just so I don't have to do that again um
25328740	25337860	um can I hide here well he looks pretty enraged to me um
25340420	25344340	I have nowhere I'm gonna go up oh no I can't go up I'm too small
25346660	25353460	where where's the crystal guys I don't really want to go abandon hope yo you who may enter
25353540	25360580	on the floor finger it's about hole oh there's this to spray them down

25385620	25392180	10 xp I'm not really sure it's worth taking the time to do that I will try and clear up this area
25392180	25396900	because if I'm to like try and find a crystal in the middle we're still free jumping I don't even know
25397460	25399460	what I'm supposed to look
25401060	25406660	oh now you come around the corner no you're such a liar you're actually such a liar you're telling

25948740	25955060	still wound for me but at least that other one ran away okay that's the problem I have with the
25955060	25962500	snipers they can do that yes thank you for coming freaking point blank why oh wow Tanjala pushed me

27660340	27661940	half the gears all day gone on
27663860	27664740	hydration check
27670740	27675460	when there's orders to fill the power cell in the system reactivate the thing
27676980	27681620	okay I'm analyzing the map so I can basically go everywhere
27682660	27687460	I just got the sweep since I was looking at it dog was getting shot in the background
27687460	27688580	literally the purvy thing
27690340	27692100	it's no therefore they spawned on time
27692180	27694340	uh
27696980	27701220	me oh it's such a shame purvy dogs also me the dogs won't leave me alone
27702340	27709060	I've had enough no that's too many no that's one too many so that's actually one too many
27709060	27713380	that's three too many if any more come at me I'm actually be region
27714420	27717940	this is too much how are you supposed to genuinely do this like
27717940	27721220	does the devs expect you to pause and do this every single time
27721940	27725940	there's no way I'm getting bit to death though
27727860	27732020	there's no way in heck I refuse I refuse
27733940	27738020	then we're gonna get spat on by the flies and then there's mere dogs
27741300	27746020	okay I somehow am making it do I need to take a little to the
27746580	27750100	okay I need to drop the buggy when I get ahead here
27751460	27754740	and then I'll have gone through the section pretty quickly
27762020	27766500	there okay we're all good again that is a pretty plan I honestly
27768980	27770260	I'm surprised I can
27772660	27772980	wow
27772980	27778100	okay there's allies ahead that's all I could see
27782340	27786260	mate you're just letting that plant absolutely decimate you for no reason
27789700	27795700	okay this is like so much easier can you actually burn the plants you know that oh wait wait wait
27795700	27796900	it's too many too many dogs
27797060	27807300	why are there so many multi-different colors but when you play like the navi side where you're
27807300	27812500	supposed to like be appreciating nature and stuff it's just like
27817380	27823060	if I have the backtrack one more time right thankfully I can teleport here
27824020	27829220	you make me backtrack one more time game I'm gonna have it out for you then I'll make myself clear
27844900	27847940	we surely must be getting back up soon with this one
27848740	27852580	I feel like we grabbed all the songs so what now
27857220	27859380	so we're to get in hard for deeds
27864580	27868020	um the navi side did the game is good the rda side
27869620	27876980	I'm just wanting it to be over with it's too hard like I'm genuinely hard no I'm not hard
27876980	27880020	sorry the game is genuinely hard on the rda side
27886340	27889300	okay so Kendra's got in doubts of what the thing is
27896020	27898100	and I don't mean I don't mean that um
27900020	27904340	so when we get the offer
27904420	27913860	why is it sending me this map is a nightmare to navigate I'm not being funny
27915300	27921300	this is probably one of the hardest maps this no this will this will be the hardest map ever
27923220	27928340	that I've had to navigate and do all this stuff and I don't even know where to start maybe the one
27928340	27935940	to my left if I take a left and then before no if I take a left and then take a right
27938340	27942180	this is the filter for the human campaign literally like
27944020	27951060	it's getting rough it's getting rough being like told to go and I know they provide transport
27951060	27958740	via the the mechs and the the buggies and that but if you're going to do it that your buggy health
27958740	27964820	makes you explode and you have to reload there's no point in providing that kind of thing like it's
27964820	27973700	just name is gonna be wait if I can okay I can resurrect I need to take the first right though
27973700	27981940	I can resurrect but it's fine oh please don't I'm gonna run out of hiding
27986420	27993380	I am running for my life I didn't even know they were going to do Thanos in the middle no no
27994260	27999700	please leave me alone please I ask kindly and respectfully to respect my space
27999700	28008980	I very kindly ask you to respect my social distance social distance please I don't know if
28008980	28015460	you've seen that Scottish meme where the guy goes social distance please but you said it so politely
28017940	28026180	I'm I'm just hauling ass there's no way I'd make this without oh right where's it up here to be honest
28026820	28032740	okay this is actually okay I'll give the game devs something this is actually kind of cool I like
28032740	28043140	the classic like spiral up something I'll see it I'll see it whoa lovely lovely thank you devs

28724020	28729860	can't believe that you're hanging about on your planet they really wanted you to
28729860	28734180	know that the RDA or the bad guys literally so punishing to play the RDA
28734180	28738780	side sorry but it like Navi so easy I was an overcritical but I don't think the
28738780	28744580	game is balanced well it just it just seems like unless I'm missing like the
28744580	28750020	gun that you're supposed to use in quotation marks I am getting brutally

29428160	29433400	gonna get snagged out of it I don't have infinite ammo I can't be messing around
29433400	29444480	like that I don't have it now is there really no way for me to go unless it's
29444480	29454080	over here I get out no it's wow this is like really rare to see in a video game
29454080	29459240	unless I'm just I don't play many video games I really do not recall levels
29459240	29465600	where you can't even reach the person I don't know maybe I'm being silly yeah
29465600	29473560	see this is right you can go right one down I don't know how much health he has
29473560	29482000	but bro I can't I cannot be spraying him with pistols like oh wait I have infinite
29482000	29494680	ammo here silly me silly Billy hold on I saw that shooting I just spray him the
29494680	29500600	entire time then I mean I'll do it don't think I won't you don't have to tell me
29500600	29505920	twice if it's a spring free mission sure he just runs around in circles over and
29506680	29512280	sadly I can't seem to reach the other NPCs oh they're attacking me actually
29512280	29524480	getting they jump in yeah whoa the AI is so brutal as a mavi sorry hold on I'm
29524480	29529440	starting to I don't know if I should actually just focus on the main guy you
29530160	29536520	said the I don't know if they're infinitely respawning or not that's the
29536520	29541760	reason why I want to clear them out but I'm getting the feeling they're
29541760	29554400	infinitely responding maybe oh I just destroyed that plant where is it wow I'm
29554400	29559420	like actually struggling wow okay half hell I think just more I think just more
29559420	29574420	down it's the best I got I'm just gonna tank it I'm I really am I'm just gonna
29574420	29588260	tank it yeah this definitely is given like battle dome unending and thanks
29588300	29592820	for waiting around until I stand up again actually do appreciate that AI oh that's
29592820	29603380	not good that's really not good oh this is what I was worried about but there's
29603380	29613220	definitely more spawning and I'm not way sure what the answer is other than
29613220	29620100	spray him that's really the best I can do just hope that we mavi cross hairs
29620100	29624340	going on he is getting staggered he is getting staggered there's there's no
29624340	29632940	denying that but the Navier again our control up here I don't have high the
29632940	29639980	plants keep respawning I don't know if maybe the plants the battle rifle can
29639980	29651940	help you in this moment oh my god shotgun and shotgun ah well let me
29651940	29657900	thought since way doesn't feel like nothing's happening right now what gun the
29657900	29664180	battle rifle battle rifle or any launcher Neil Gunn is it actually called
29664180	29673820	battle rifle issue rifle I've got machine gun ish standard issue

29703380	29708660	that I believe I believe it's just gonna take a sweet time like especially if the
29708660	29714980	game just constantly is resupplying with new Navi for this guy it makes me
29714980	29721740	think this is the last boss fight in the last match though because this is big
29721740	29730180	like this is big this is protection prayer on I can hardly see his body to
29730940	29748380	okay yeah okay okay okay frickin did it we don't do okay oh oh he's mad I foiled

29859820	29867020	a revive if I go down by the way yeah see this that this the amount of abilities
29867020	29872460	they use I'm sure I could probably be utilizing my abilities better but like
29872460	29888060	this prayer protection is so constant it's so fucking constant I really hope
29888060	29904900	nothing else responds I can't tolerate if he's gonna get stuck I will happily
29904900	29923820	take that oh my god more spawned in please I literally don't have a revive I

31288320	31300320	them are using... I can't. I can't. I hate to be the UwU girl that goes, I literally
31300320	31306360	can't right now. I literally can't right now. I don't even know where the Thanator is.
31306440	31314440	Is the Thanator stuck? At least she's the Thanator. Are you stuck? Oh thank the maker.
31314440	31327440	Thank the maker, this is a buggy old 2009 game. Eat lead in puke because oh my gosh this game
31327440	31336240	is so hard. I heard that, I heard you, I literally just heard you spawning. Oh yeah and just heal
31336240	31340240	up. No it's fine, it's fine, just heal all your health. It's fine, it doesn't matter.
31340240	31351240	It doesn't matter. No it doesn't matter at all. Get out of my face. No, no! All the time.
31351240	31363240	Get out, I'm literally freaking walling on stuff. Go away. Stop healing, stop healing.
31363240	31374240	Stop! I need to reload like this right now. Yeah, hold on, let me take a breather. I just
31374240	31389240	needed one breather, like literally a second to formulate a thought. Ah! Ah the freaking...
31389240	31396240	I'm trying so hard, I literally am trying so hard. This is just, and then just spawn
31396240	31407240	more navi there, they're coming down the hill. I'm stuck against something. Oh please, please!
31408240	31422240	Oh, um, uh, I cast protection. Oh, oh and um, oh, oh, don't do that, don't do that again,
31422240	31436240	that's not funny. Talk meeeeere! I'm gonna fucking lose it if I actually die here. Go and just
31436240	31445240	perish to the elements or something. This is insane. This is standing the field up. No.
31445240	31451240	Get staggered beyond belief and they don't stagger when they use that ability. And their
31451240	31455240	ability to freaking his own cooldown, there's no such thing as cooldown to them, they actually
31455240	31463240	don't know what it is. But my cooldown lasts forever! Literally I can't even cast protection.
31464240	31474240	Oh and I need to reload at the stupid freaking orange box! And I've got one. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
31474240	31485240	yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No one's surprised. Freaking spraying. It's literally the more health...
31485240	31492240	No, yeah, you just do it again. Again with the same move. Oh this is getting ridiculous,
31492240	31498240	mate. Go and just get a rest, honestly. Oh and you'd repel back to health again because
31498240	31503240	you can't even just 1v fucking 1v. Literally, I'm not being funny, but if these are like
31503240	31508240	supposed to be avatars with like titanium bones and stuff and you literally can't 1v 1v without
31508240	31514240	fucking prayer protection on every 2 seconds with that stupid move!
31519240	31533240	Oh, fucking terrible, actually. Just perish! Honestly, stop using these abilities. Oh my god, man.
31533240	31543240	Yay, we did it! Let's go! Oh, I'm so glad that's over. Right, let's move on to the next one.
31543240	31549240	Yeah, and they're already shooting me. Already, already, already. Right, okay, we'll teleport.
31549240	31555240	Gigi easy. Oh, I just... I keep forgetting that I'm not as tall as Navi so I can't just
31555240	31564240	jump that. Oh, well, I didn't need to go on that so sure, whatever. We did it! That was awful.
31564240	31570240	That was awful. You don't even pick the difficulty in this thing. My controller is literally dripping
31570240	31575240	with sweat. I thought you loved having autism. It's such a nice little fun tree on the side,
31575240	31582240	doesn't it? Not. Oh, and I get to do one more. The protection prayer made me think this was
31582240	31591240	a runescape stream for a second. Yeah, literally. If I could cast it. Oh.
31595240	31600240	Is there a donation? Did I miss a donation? I think it's working. I don't know. Someone said
31600240	31604240	they couldn't but then I think a few more donations came through after that so I don't
31604240	31611240	know if it's messing up on Firefox or things are just not happy. Don't worry about it if
31611240	31622240	it's not working. Oh, sorry. I just... Oh, I just choked on that. What month to go?
31622240	31636240	Plain? Take a scorpion and report to the last commander. Yeah, let's try it. Oh. You'll read
31636240	31643240	it later. I just sent one a bit ago. I don't see it. You're not the only one to say that
31643240	31650240	you've sent a thingy but it's not came through. I don't know why. The last one I see is from
31650240	31658240	TinySpiny. It says I've returned from the dog. Wait, did it actually not go through? I don't
31658240	31662240	want you to don't know if it's not showing up seriously though. Like if it's not showing
31662240	31670240	up, don't know. I don't know what's going on. Where the heck? What am I supposed to go
31670240	31674240	on my... Can I just fly through that? Oh, no. I have to fly through the gap. I can already
31674240	31686240	tell. The last commander seems promising. I can hope so. The RDA site is... It's been
31686240	31697240	an experience but I'm not sure it's been won for... Yeah, okay. Okay, okay. Let's just
31697240	31701240	break through the rocks. Don't mind me. Don't worry. I'm always happy to escort my local
31701240	31709240	calm fish. I know I wouldn't display them. Where am I going? Just a little to the right.
31709240	31715240	Oh, my goodness. Okay, there's the helipad that I'm supposed to land on. Thank goodness. Make
31715240	31725240	it nice and easy for me. A little cheeky crash land in there. Don't mind me. Is this not it?
31725240	31730240	Looks like it. At least when it's over, you can see you've finally completed the game.
31730240	31737240	Honestly, it's been fun but there's a reason my Tism didn't attach on this game too much
31737240	31744240	because there's quite a few things like that that are really annoying. Hey, last one.
31744240	31747240	Oh.
31751240	31756240	The only reason I could even win that last fight is because I managed to cheat that Thanotaur.
31756240	31761240	I cannot imagine if I would even get past that if that Thanotaur didn't get caught in the
31761240	31766240	roll. I'm sorry. I said that wrong.
31771240	31774240	Am I allowed to slide to get there?
31774240	31779240	I'm going to be giving me a mix. I'll take a mix because he's giving me a mix.
31779240	31786240	Then you can play the domination minigame. I like on the navi side. I've never played it on this side.
31787240	31795240	Alrighty. If I take a right, then everything shall be alright.
31795240	31800240	Let's hope this last one. Strony, you sound sleepy. I hope you're having fun.
31800240	31803240	You know, I'm having fun. I know that sounds like a-
31803240	31809240	That's a fat punch. I'm getting spawned spanked by a freaking plant.
31810240	31815240	I'm enjoying it. It's just because I've never played it before.
31815240	31820240	I just did not expect at all how unbelievably hard it was.
31820240	31827240	For example, there's RDA soldiers literally getting messed up by these plants.
31827240	31833240	They're just letting it happen. I had no idea they would make it so hard.
31833240	31836240	On the navi side, you can just ignore everything.
31836240	31840240	But when you're a wee human, you actually can't ignore everything.
31840240	31843240	Or else you're like a big doo-doo.
31854240	31859240	I'm hoping I do get a good night's sleep soon because it's really hard to be creative.
31859240	31865240	RDAs and MarkoLabs are coming up with scripts when I've literally got no thoughts going on behind my skull.
31870240	31872240	There's RDAs.
31874240	31878240	I'm actually going to pick it up because they're too valuable.
31878240	31881240	Wait, I can't even go up on my head.
31883240	31886240	Okay, I need to climb on foot.
31887240	31890240	RDAs say it's too real sad.
31890240	31892240	I hope you're doing a good night's sleep.
31892240	31896240	Yeah, I've not had a decent one in quite a while.
31896240	31899240	Oh my god, there's so many of them.
31899240	31902240	Okay, that was good. I like that.
31902240	31905240	I think it tears that fast all the time. That's great.
31907240	31914240	See, when it misses, it really bothers me.
31917240	31921240	Oh, I'm just going in biz. I don't know. There's enemies everywhere.
31925240	31927240	Oh, I can hear one right behind me.
31927240	31930240	I'm going to try and claim this before default.
31930240	31932240	Get some rest. I will get some good rest.
31932240	31935240	I don't know what my stream is tomorrow. I can't remember.
31935240	31937240	Is it ASMR?
31940240	31942240	Or is that a small game?
31943240	31946240	I think it goes ASMR sweets.
31946240	31948240	Oh, this is a boss fight.
31948240	31950240	Yeah, I'm already getting ruled.
31950240	31952240	Oh, I'm already getting ruled by boss.
31952240	31954240	Okay, this is what I can't stand.
31954240	31959240	I'm about to go do a boss fight and there's like a billion rub.
31959240	31962240	Nah, nah, come on, mate.
31963240	31965240	Yeah, this is getting ridiculous.
31966240	31968240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
31968240	31971240	Thank goodness I was picking up RDA things.
31973240	31974240	Whoa.
31977240	31979240	No, no, you're so dead.
31979240	31980240	Get that.
31981240	31985240	Right, a spell of protection, spell of invincibility,
31985240	31987240	because what the actual?
31989240	31991240	Bro, you're going to need to let...
31992240	31994240	I'm dead on the last one.
31995240	31996240	I need a breather.
31997240	32002240	I literally need a health breather.
32002240	32005240	The AI can freaking see me.
32008240	32011240	Yeah, she literally won't go down
32011240	32014240	because she keeps activating all of her abilities.
32014240	32016240	This is ridiculous.
32020240	32022240	Right, so they're...
32023240	32025240	Okay.
32027240	32030240	Bro, you're just stun-locking me.
32032240	32034240	I literally can't get close enough.
32037240	32040240	Yeah, how do you like being fucking stun-locked?
32040240	32042240	Oh, fuck off!
32043240	32046240	Just infinite spawn after spot.
32046240	32048240	So get the fucking moab out, honestly.
32049240	32052240	What the fucking is this shit, honestly?
32057240	32059240	Have I activated it?
32059240	32060240	Hello, stamina?
32066240	32067240	Lovely.
32068240	32069240	Let me analize.
32069240	32071240	That did a sweet fuck all.
32071240	32072240	Lovely, lovely.
32072240	32075240	Don't ever show your fucking hideous face again.
32075240	32077240	That was what bloody waste that was.
32078240	32080240	Right, that's the best I got, Berserk.
32081240	32083240	Berserk's literally the best I got.
32084240	32087240	And I get stunned the moment I use it.
32091240	32094240	Bro, I need to put a little invisible on
32094240	32096240	so I can literally heal in time.
32098240	32101240	I'm gonna get stunned the millisecond.
32106240	32109240	This is why I don't play read games on stream
32109240	32112240	because I literally can't even handle a normal game.
32113240	32115240	And then invisible again so I can't get him
32115240	32117240	and then tarot him shooting at me
32117240	32119240	and then stun me, and stun me, and stun me,
32119240	32121240	and stun me, and stun me, and stun me.
32121240	32123240	Okay, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it.
32123240	32125240	We love a good stun, we all...
32126240	32128240	And then, yeah, and then into the spawn rate.
32128240	32129240	What are their abilities?
32129240	32131240	You literally just use that one
32131240	32134240	so you don't even have a cooldown at all.
32134240	32137240	Oh, and then in comes your buddy use.
32137240	32139240	Yeah, and then your buddy uses their ability.
32139240	32142240	And then I'm away wasting ammo yet again.
32142240	32145240	Oh, yeah, again, I'm not the frickin' boss.
32147240	32149240	You're gonna need to get a great game.
32149240	32151240	Honestly, you're gonna need, again, a straight to ability.
32151240	32153240	Can't, need to wait, need to wait.
32156240	32158240	Again, straight to ability.
32158240	32160240	Fucking infinite, buddy.
32160240	32162240	Yep, and then the gift.
32162240	32164240	No, oh, a Christmas miracle.
32164240	32166240	I actually got a fucking thing from it.
32168240	32169240	Wow.
32169240	32171240	Oh, and your pal's already back.
32172240	32174240	I've not even been away for, like, on the list, I think.
32175240	32178240	I'm gonna have to go into this and fucking do this, right?
32178240	32180240	At least I've reloaded, but...
32181240	32183240	Yeah, and I'm already in spanked.
32183240	32185240	I don't even remember the fucking enemy that I'm supposed to be killing is.
32185240	32187240	Oh, and straight to the ability.
32187240	32189240	What a classic.
32190240	32192240	Oh, more of your pal's!
32195240	32196240	There's nothing I can do.
32196240	32199240	There's actually nothing I can do other than tick damage.
32199240	32204240	This is just the tiniest amount of damage that can be dealt at any moment.
32204240	32205240	And it just...
32205240	32207240	Over and over again!
32209240	32212240	Literally playing this game over and over again.
32212240	32214240	One hit, get nothing more.
32214240	32216240	Have to heal, get nothing more.
32216240	32218240	Just fucking perish off.
32218240	32220240	Fucking map!
32221240	32223240	Uh, I'm dead. I'm actually dead.
32224240	32227240	I don't have a invis, and I don't have a heal.
32230240	32233240	I don't know what you want me to do.
32236240	32238240	Who made this? Ubisoft?
32239240	32240240	How many game...
32240240	32242240	How many fucking playtesters have you got?
32242240	32244240	Like, one max, maybe?
32244240	32246240	Do you share one for, like, one fucking region?
32246240	32247240	One for whole of Oceanic?
32247240	32248240	One for whole of Bloody Europe?
32248240	32250240	One for whole of fucking America?
32250240	32251240	Like, what's going on?
32251240	32252240	None of you's playtested this.
32252240	32253240	Not one person.
32253240	32255240	Not one person!
32255240	32257240	Listen!
32258240	32260240	Oh, let me just analyze and see if this is...
32260240	32261240	There seems fair.
32261240	32262240	Hmm...
32262240	32265240	Right, let's do infinite spawning.
32265240	32267240	Let's make sure you get stun law, right?
32267240	32268240	Okay, hmm...
32268240	32269240	Alright, let's do it.
32269240	32270240	Let's do it!
32270240	32272240	Let's do a cheeky gangbang!
32272240	32274240	Oh my God!
32274240	32276240	Let's just do a cheeky gangbang and make sure that the enemies...
32276240	32278240	Enemies are allowed to infinite heal.
32278240	32280240	It's fine. Enemies can infinite heal.
32280240	32282240	Enemies can infinite fucking use their abilities.
32282240	32283240	All the fucking time!
32283240	32288240	And as soon as you give them a Santa me are off of their HP bar
32288240	32294600	Oh, let's just make sure they just give them everything all it wants infinite fucking mana. Oh
32294900	32296900	My god
32296900	32298900	Just let it be over with
32299140	32302840	Just let it happen. Oh my god
32305760	32307760	Like I literally need to go invisible
32308160	32313520	Oh my god, just let it be over
32314840	32316840	Just let it be over
32317440	32323520	Again, yeah instant stun lock as soon as you shit. I don't even have that ability is Navi when I play Navi
32323520	32325520	I don't even have this ability
32326480	32331240	Just instant fucking lock over and over and and your pals are back
32331960	32333960	I
32334720	32339320	Would absolutely love to have a whole fucking trade behind me, but I've nobody got that extension have a
32362240	32364240	I
32372280	32374280	Best I can do
32380720	32385480	100 got 100 shotgun shells was there enough may you go get more
32386200	32394960	Because it was now of course it was down off. Oh, yeah, no, it's fine. No, it's fine. I didn't want one
32400040	32402040	Yep, no, it's fine. I
32404600	32406600	Love being absolutely incapacitated
32409280	32411280	No, this is so fun
32412280	32413800	I
32413800	32421560	Love it. You should do it more Ashley. How about you just spawn eight NPCs all fucking one said one time. Oh my fucking god
32423200	32428280	Fucking RDA fan is honestly. Oh, and I'm probably gonna die jumping off this clutch looking me
32428640	32433460	Just to really fucking ace it on the cake. They just actually can he stop it. They actually
32437120	32439120	Yeah
32441880	32448040	Yep, and all aimed even though in viz all in will continue probably not even be able to heal and play man
32448040	32449400	I get to die
32449400	32453000	Because I only have one fucking RDA element to my fucking name
32453640	32455640	But here
32458240	32459920	Yeah
32459920	32464880	This better be the last mission. I am like fucking correct right now. I
32465920	32468640	Really hope like I severely hope this is the last mission
32468640	32470640	I
32471000	32473840	Instant damage to the mech not even in the body sign
32475920	32480240	For the cheeky gang bang party parrot party parrot party parrot
32482040	32485320	It's never fucking ending volt was it vault
32487000	32493720	Vulcan thank you for the tip. It's never ending. There is no way that was
32494120	32497880	appropriately play tested unless I'm missing like
32498640	32505720	Some major notes and I missed a massive patch that came out for this game in 2009 that there's no
32506200	32507200	way
32507200	32511720	That is the gameplay and then the dev team happy with that game
32513720	32516840	Refused to accept that that even got passed
32519560	32522060	Absolutely refused to accept that got passed I
32522260	32531340	Don't think anyone got this far in the police say I completely agree with that statement because what on earth was that
32532980	32537380	Literally, I don't have an ability when I play Navi if I get hit I have a massive fucking throbbing
32537700	32543020	Fucking pulse coming from a bloody groin. No, I don't want to teleport. I want to talk to the man
32546300	32548300	Please let it be over
32552980	32555260	Hmm let it be over
32556820	32558820	Let it be over. Yeah, I'm not
32562820	32564820	Let it be over
32567380	32571420	Yeah, that Moab did absolutely nothing. I don't even know what the point of that was
32573020	32577820	Let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over
32578820	32581620	Thanks for borrowing a condom
32585980	32589860	This game was pretty bad pretty fast after lunch thanks to the game getting canned hard
32590620	32596260	And took their money in around I mean they made them if they got two points seven million sales. Yeah
32602420	32604420	Are we there
32604460	32610620	You so much you put a scratch there there last at least the section saying you were you mean that wasn't the last section
32610620	32613020	Are you implying there is more to this fucking thing?
32613620	32616740	Horses or did you to board a dragon to fly to some location?
32617460	32620780	This is why mommy likes me hold her hand. Yes. This is why I like
32625500	32630140	You're still streaming. Oh, you just missed the part where I screamed down the make so yeah
32631020	32633020	Oh
32634620	32639380	Please let me go with this right why does the conductor keep putting me on?
32639820	32643860	Why did they keep creating more and more sections of this fucking site of the map?
32648380	32653580	Okay, this is it this is it the map looks like this is it there's nothing more of the matter
32654140	32656140	We just got worth it fuck was gone broke. Oh
32657780	32663220	Well, we all pretended that you finished the game and you can go risk. No, this is it
32663820	32669300	Look at the map. There's no way this map is a fetch quest because look at the state of it. There's nothing on it. Oh
32671820	32673820	Did I get to drive this at least
32675380	32677380	It's over
32677820	32679820	It's over
32680660	32683700	Oh, how do I fly this? Oh fuck me, man. Oh
32685980	32688660	No, oh no, I don't like that. Oh, no
32691580	32698060	Right, okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, huh. Oh, yeah, I can fly I can fly
32699620	32703380	Call me Peter Pan because you can fly you can fly you can fly
32704380	32709580	Okay, take it easy easy on the corners easy
32710700	32717900	Pandora is a little wild for the road bumps and by road bumps the full mass of asphalt
32721020	32723020	You can shoot the rocks
32727100	32729100	Oh
32729100	32731100	Oh
32731980	32733980	Wait, I'm gonna run out of missiles
32742100	32747660	That was a very successful drive, I think I don't think I actually bumped into one thing
32749820	32751820	Easy easy
32753700	32755700	Oh
32760100	32764740	Okay, there are wolves, but that's fine. Nothing I can't handle. Oh
32766420	32769900	I can't do my little flip in the war. It will flip
32772300	32774300	What kind of sadistic
32775020	32778500	Made to say you should be able to run out of missiles honestly
32778500	32785100	It does seem about like that flight thing that flying dragon is massive and you're telling me they can't hold more than like 20
32785100	32787100	missiles. Oh
32787500	32792820	Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Why are you holding that piece of paper? Oh
32806500	32808500	What's the plan
32809500	32811500	I'm not going anywhere near me
32812500	32818020	We could use your help get that wall down and dig in I'm gonna do I'm gonna put down TNT
32819540	32826980	As long as there's no boss fight, I couldn't be less of a rats or what fetch quest you send me on name your boss fights
32828340	32831380	What is this? What is this armor?
32833500	32837260	Protection down but everything else up. I think I'd rather protection up
32839380	32841380	Just leave it leave it
32841700	32843700	What's this? Right? What's the deal?
32845100	32847100	What much I do?
32847980	32852220	As long as there's no boss fight on the other side, I couldn't give the last of a rat
32854100	32856100	I couldn't give the last rat
32860980	32862980	Anymore
32863980	32868380	If the goal was to make the count and pain memorable they should be sure succeeded
32868500	32870860	Oh, I'd say more like miserable because
32871820	32876700	Again, like literally the Navi instantly do that as soon as you injure them. They do their thing
32878500	32880500	Except that one I guess
32881940	32885660	Let's just let's navigate we're appropriate
32888980	32890980	I don't know if I should just speed run it
32892500	32894980	Can the make even go on the bridge that's up ahead?
32899500	32901500	Oh
32902580	32909060	Like this game parish definitely, yeah, thanks for that really appreciate that. Um
32911340	32915780	Why am I being shot? I'm being chased. I'm being chased
32918900	32920900	Um
32921900	32927700	Oh, yeah, definitely happy to replay that's true brotherhood not happy to replay
32930820	32934940	The Navi side yay fun the RDA side. Oh my god
32936420	32941660	I think I've almost got two revives, but I don't think I have a boss fight anymore
32941660	32943660	I think this is literally just
32943660	32945660	Spring pray from here on out
32950900	32952900	Oh
32966620	32971420	That's a lot of Navi and they're probably gonna destroy my make-up. I'm not careful
32973220	32975420	Where's BT when you need them honestly?
32981900	32983900	I
32984340	32991700	Might get out for that RDA dangerous, but I'm like it seems to be I just want a few revives on hand
32991700	32993700	Oh, right. I've got two revives now
32994780	32998420	As long as I can choose a hate thing if there's a fight ahead. I
32998900	33000900	Just hope this oh my god, my mix
33001820	33003820	Well, look at me. Let's just go for it
33003940	33005940	I
33008780	33010780	Right just go keep going
33011260	33013260	Just like there's fates all the way up ahead
33014020	33016020	We need BT
33017700	33022380	Honestly sorry for reason the idea of RDA, but thank you for experience in it
33023260	33028660	Thank you for experiencing the pain. I mean some people enjoy when streamers rage. I don't know
33029540	33031340	I
33031340	33036540	Got taken out in viz for that like some people genuinely love when streamers rage and I'm like
33038180	33044180	Hold off the Navi. No, you are not gonna make them literally
33050180	33055300	I don't know how freaking strong you think I am I am not that good. I that's
33056260	33064460	Okay, I'm gonna try and keep a lid on it and not get overwhelmed very quickly. I am so glad I picked up the other RDA
33068780	33070780	I can't do anything
33078180	33080180	Yeah, I'm gonna need you guys
33081180	33083180	I
33084860	33089500	Need everyone to start spamming needs everywhere because I'm pretty sure those are RDA needs
33089500	33093140	I'm gonna need everyone to do that unanimously unanimously right now
33095180	33098020	It's not it's okay, just sacrifice me in the fire
33100660	33106100	Oh, and I'm taking out in viz, which is the only time it helps to redo my
33110900	33117300	Okay, I feel and then the damage protection to tell I can get my heal back up
33119620	33121620	I need long range
33125660	33132420	Our bombs, okay, those are definitely our needs. I feel like if the Navi were doing needs like that, I'd be a goner already
33133740	33136380	Okay, okay, we're not overrun
33140500	33147100	But don't want to jinx it, but I'm gonna grab that it's really important
33149180	33153980	I'm really jinxed it but it's looking good only a minute 30 of this and then we're done
33159620	33161620	Okay
33162860	33165140	Protection on I don't really want to make me too much
33170900	33172900	I'll take
33177060	33180580	Okay, I don't know every spamming needs to keep doing that shit. Oh my god
33181220	33185860	It's literally sunlocking them from hitting us. Oh, that's a lot. That's a lot. Hold on. Oh
33189300	33197220	Dear I think I think maybe some of our soldiers went down because we're getting no, okay now we're overrun again
33200180	33205140	If I can just whittle down some base health on them, it just makes all the world is different
33213700	33217540	Oh, we might actually have three roses. Oh, I'm getting sunlocked my pardon
33219860	33225460	I'm not that mad because I'm actually getting help like genuinely getting help and like they're not all all
33225780	33229700	On to me it's when they all all often there's like nothing I can do hold on sorry
33230500	33232420	Because I'm too busy
33232420	33234420	freezing the game for not being absolutely
33235540	33237540	I take it back
33244100	33248940	Why do you fill out your pistols every time why do you insist on filling out the pistols?
33249820	33252180	Well, I hope it didn't die because of that freaking cutscene
33252980	33254500	Oh
33254500	33260580	Is mercy up by the way, I think mercy may be alive. I may have completely missed it during my reach
33262820	33264820	Oh
33282500	33284500	Oh
33290420	33297060	Okay, no, so they are still attacking whatever but I mean I'm getting left them own devices. I'll take it
33301940	33308980	Danger danger danger high voltage. Okay. Mercy is live. Yes. Uh, monster. Welcome to link her. We will redirect into her
33308980	33313300	I think we're almost done. I am going for a nap after this stream. I can tell you that much
33316260	33318020	Wow
33318020	33323060	Mercy's region. Yeah, if you want it, I don't know you'll need to see who reaches more me or mercy
33326100	33328100	Oh, I'm done
33328900	33330900	I can sense it
33331220	33333700	I'm licking the screen right now
33334660	33336660	Almost done
33337060	33340420	You know, that's what I'm talking about now. We can take it to the room
33342260	33344260	You need more than enough
33346260	33350660	One reach stream to the next return to your dragon and fly to the well of souls. We've done it
33352420	33358580	The evil has been defeated. I will never I'm very happy to say I will never play the rda side again
33359620	33362420	Oh, uh a rank rotten experience
33363380	33368180	Dev team do not speak ever again and do not cook ever again
33370260	33373540	Thank you and good night. That's my review
33378500	33381220	Forward a little to the right
33384980	33392340	The gamer region real I was just it was just rinse and repeat rinse and repeat in the moment. I've got even uh
33392740	33399620	A hint of damage a lick of damage to speed things up. Uh, either new guys were brought in
33408900	33410740	Oh, it is I actually have a health bar just
33411860	33415940	Definitely shouldn't be taking these corners too willy-nilly then
33416740	33424420	I'm gonna start showing you but I can't help but find out whole when you're angry. Oh my god. I feel like that would be terrifying
33429540	33433780	I'm making that PP shrivel up and go back and save me. I'm just gonna be terrified
33434820	33436820	If I was on the receiving end of that
33440020	33442420	Same here it's kind of what no
33443380	33446020	Oh, my god. Sorry. Sorry women moments
33447220	33449220	Looks partners bad boy
33453060	33457780	Right we did it we have confirmed the evil
33459620	33463460	Is the game gonna let us get there without being attacked by a plan
33464100	33466100	Oh
33467700	33474100	No fighting here or I'm gonna cry. I'm gonna angry spot is more. I'm sorry so but terrifies mommy
33478260	33480260	Right oh
33483780	33485780	Oh
33485780	33487780	Oh
33492020	33494020	I'm going
33494420	33496020	Listen to you
33496020	33500340	The new recruit fresh from earth. I've been working on this for over 10 years
33500500	33503620	This is my moment right now. So if it doesn't work
33504260	33508180	I'll see you on the other side. Oh wait. I have to I need to end him anyway
33511300	33513300	Oh
33514260	33518340	Well, this is gonna be beautifully satisfying
33521620	33524980	Just let me cook a bit. Okay. It's fine. He has a belly. He's allowed him
33524980	33531860	But yeah, it's just gonna be satisfying all things considered. Actually, you know what I could probably put on that double aggression thing
33533540	33536100	Preserver. Yeah, let's do that
33538820	33540820	Okay, that's fine
33541780	33543780	Oh, he healed up
33545700	33549380	I'm not sure I can send it to you healing up. So don't do that again
33553780	33556420	Okay, I kind of like some walking and more I'm not gonna lie
33558980	33563460	That's okay. He doesn't really seem to do anything. It seems like he blows
33570820	33572820	Hmm
33580260	33583700	I'm just giving him it. I'm just throwing everything out. I'm hold on a minute
33586820	33591860	Oh, wow, so the sonic pulse is too far away none. Okay, he's full healed again
33594900	33599460	Now sadly I am going to run out of ammo doing this method
33600420	33604500	So not really sure what's supposed to happen
33607860	33612420	It's fine you're allowed to do that, but maybe don't heal again
33615540	33617540	Um
33620020	33624180	Um, am I supposed to do something special for this fight?
33630420	33635780	I don't know how many heals you get. If you get like five and then the game's like, okay, no more heals for you
33636020	33638020	Well, why did the aim do it?
33643540	33653300	Uh, is there like a ammo station? There was one back there. Uh, I'm literally out other than my shorty
33659460	33661460	Oh
33673460	33678500	I'm not like mad at this fight or anything, but like bro you keep healing like there's nothing I can do
33680980	33682980	I don't like
33690420	33692420	You use my mortar strike on him
33708340	33710340	I did nothing to him
33712020	33714020	Hello
33715780	33717780	Um
33719700	33724740	I'm a bit confused. Sorry. I need to change out my weapons because they're all empty. So I can't
33725460	33727460	the nail gun sure
33728180	33731620	Uh, it's already full me and there's no point in making it at flame doors or
33734020	33739380	Uh, machine gun? I don't know. Okay. Oh, this one's different
33744100	33746100	Okay, nail gun again
33747060	33749060	All right, healed again
33751460	33754900	I don't know if I'm supposed to call upon Awa to do something
33757700	33761540	The utility looks like it's less literally sneaking on. I guess he's just a damage on
33762660	33764660	Wait, just go to the glowing thing
33765380	33767380	The thing back here
33767780	33769780	No, it's a bit of a glowing thing
33770020	33772020	I'm
33772340	33774020	Blowing
33774020	33776020	Sorry, I'm brain
33776500	33778980	I'm both brain dead. I'm bling bling thing
33780100	33781940	I'm looking
33781940	33786340	But yeah, I'm starting to think I'm needing to like call upon Awa to like end him because
33787140	33792820	I'm literally like swimming right now. Excuse me. I tried to go for a wee swim before I ended you
33794740	33796740	I'm just gonna like up on Awa. Oops. Sorry
33796820	33798820	Oh
33799060	33801060	Blowing
33803460	33806660	I'm definitely not to claim Awa right now glowing
33811780	33815380	I thought that stick. I mean that stick is glowing. What the fuck it is
33816100	33818100	I
33822260	33827220	Warning de synchronization imminent honestly, can you bring him to a ledge?
33831220	33833380	I feel like I'm supposed to do something here
33839300	33842500	I think it's broke. Okay, so I watched a quick video and the guy
33843460	33847460	He uses a green angel. Oh greening greening launcher. Okay
33850660	33855140	Is this a grenade launcher? I only have 20 on the grenade
33858500	33860500	Oh
33861620	33867780	Oh, wow, really? Okay after all of that bro
33867860	33874980	I'm starting to think this shit wasn't playtested at all past this point
33894180	33896180	Are we the baddies
33897780	33899780	All right
33906100	33908980	Um, yeah, let's see where the baddies all right
33912900	33914900	Ryder you there colonel quarch
33915380	33920020	Analyst is going like a baseball stadium. What the hell did you do? I'm not sure
33920260	33926580	Whatever you did it worked, but now we are making a quick retreat. I'm getting reports. They lost control of their band cheese
33926820	33928820	That makes sense to you. Yeah
33928900	33930260	It actually does
33930260	33932660	Congrats Ryder. You're gonna be a hero for this
33933300	33937860	I'll get your butt down here and that dragon better be spotless. He had damage on the dragon
33938900	33944980	Eat that you grace. I heard we lost Kendra, but you need to know you did the right thing
33945700	33947700	I hope it was all right
33948020	33951140	This better bring peace. You've stopped a catastrophe, but this isn't over
33951700	33956500	We can't keep control available for long nor should we and we've got more shit
33956580	33958580	of humans do to arrive
33958980	33961300	More is inevitable. So what was this all for?
33961860	33966500	A we needed to see what we're not there being part two spoilers from the movie in the video game
33966900	33968900	Next time she'll be ready
33970980	33972980	Am I here
33976580	33979940	Development team should be ashamed of yourself for the rda side
33980580	33986020	Development team should be proud of yourselves from the navi side. Don't ever make me do that again. That's awful
33987060	33989060	Oh my god
33990980	33994260	I have no idea how hard I reach because I can't remember in the moment
33995300	33997300	But oh my god
33998820	34001460	Am I going mental or was that terrible?
34003620	34008820	I think I must have I think I should have been using the grenade launcher clearly from that last fight
34009380	34012100	and and because I didn't use the grenade launcher
34013220	34014900	and
34014980	34017780	It just got from like bad to worse or
34018500	34023220	You blacked out when you raised. I don't remember really what I just remember like I did get angry
34023780	34027380	But I don't remember anything that actually happened like one minute
34027380	34032980	I was like getting annoyed and then the next minute the fight was over and I got stuck on a rock and I was trying to get down
34036020	34040260	A grenade launcher is op. Okay, I guess that's probably you're shouting quite a bit
34041060	34043060	I'm cheeky. Bye
34043380	34050020	She literally saw red. Honestly. It was beautiful. Monka is you're rage is hot, but the mission was bad
34051700	34057700	Angry girl, you were fuming at the man. I was frothing for mama. I clipped it. So show up one stream and it's Monka
34057780	34062260	I don't even know. Am I going to be embarrassed if I look back on it like I don't feel that bad right now
34062420	34064420	So kind of been that bad
34065380	34071060	The game got dunked on hard and forgotten pretty quickly, but for the general community for a lot of good reasons
34073460	34078020	At least you finished it. You deserve a good rest. Good girl. I'm proud of you for not driving up
34078420	34085060	The rage has talked to your content. Well, that is literally why I do not play rage games like mercies unironically so brave
34085780	34089380	For playing that game. Like I couldn't I'd just be scurrying and
34090340	34096020	It may be a bit embarrassing, but at least it seems to have been for a good reason. I felt that rage. It's so funny
34096740	34100820	Also, you might want to make more tea before sleeping or after waking up or for my voice
34102020	34106820	I mean, it felt like a justifiable rage or he just won't make us cause the rage was justified. Okay
34107380	34109380	Congrats. You did good job thing
34110100	34115220	So you need more than an app. You may need to fill it. Oh, I hope I can get like a full eight hours. I've been needing it for a while
34116180	34120420	Hmm, you didn't give up. So you did a good job at least. Heck yeah
34121860	34128420	Mad cause bad. Lamar true. Literally all I had to do was pull out the grinny launcher
34129460	34131460	apparently
34131860	34133620	Lucky me
34133620	34135620	Lucky me. All I had to do was pull it
34136900	34138900	Take these head pads
34139460	34141460	I would have went insane. You're amazing
34142180	34147700	Well, then I feel like you guys probably would have figured out to swap to the weapon way before I did so
34148580	34152260	Sending hugs if they're welcome. Otherwise you did so good. I'll take those hugs
34153220	34156020	Are you the first person to finish this campaign on stream?
34156500	34160660	Stop imagine if I was like the first vtuber to play this game. That would be hilarious
34161460	34167940	And and the pov is like isn't the navi side amazing and then the rd side is me just screaming
34167940	34173220	Sorry for forcing you to play that. I feel bad now. Nah, come on. I can stop at any time
34174980	34177700	I just say stilettos and then I would stop. Don't worry
34178660	34184100	If you're the first that counts as a world record, I would have thrown my monitor before changing weapons
34184740	34186740	making vtuber history
34187300	34192260	So when an angry scot rages. Oh, so wins the angry scotch rages somewhere on
34192260	34194260	the floor
34194580	34201940	I'm pretty sure you are though. Oh, no, I'm what sorry. I've already I've already forgotten what I'm probably would have overgranted
34203460	34208580	Before and killed it with a bigger number. You're probably the only one that ever will you can be the avatar of youtuber
34210020	34212500	The way of the water the way of the scot
34214100	34219940	You did great powering through that heck. Yeah, think about it. You used the worst weapon to beat the game. Honestly
34220820	34224580	I actually think you are the first vtuber to do answer every shipper history
34224660	34227620	Not even a weekend after debut and i'm already making history
34228180	34230900	But see fully the rda was a lot more fun than the navi
34231140	34236980	Why because of the rage apparently everyone's got you know, half masked at the moment because they liked my rage
34238500	34241780	The way of the scot the cut fish the way school and
34242900	34247060	You have a full monopoly on this game now. Okay. Okay. I'll take it. I'll take it
34248020	34251220	I'm the type to pause the game and watch a video spin feeding me on what to do
34251540	34255060	Honestly small streamer did two years ago, but for both campaigns. Yes
34256340	34258340	half half
34258500	34262820	Now i'm going to get the game to relieve or to relive the pain
34263620	34265620	You can't me
34266500	34271540	Yeah, let's say half only half wait, there's no way i'll need to make a rage ASMR if that's okay
34272420	34274420	I don't mean suffering like that
34274660	34278500	Like honestly, I feel fine now, but I guess in the moment. I was like scary region
34280100	34283140	Sorry if I scared anyone. I apologize
34284660	34288020	Got some ancestral rage build up in me, I guess
34291780	34294740	Me just skipping 60 percent past all the enemies honestly
34295620	34299540	60 percent probably like 100 percent of the optional fights i skipped like i'm not even kidding
34299860	34301860	Now you scare us more. No, you didn't scare
34303460	34306420	You could do it more. You're like, well, I do have a
34307940	34311780	Donut's lawn reward potentially being that rage, but yeah
34312900	34317780	Stormy rage should be like you call that a willy. That's just prophetic, you know
34320900	34325380	That was uh, that wasn't scary. It was the opposite. Oh the fabled Scottish rage
34325700	34331140	I mean, I was scared and felt something else at the same time. I'm not gonna explain. That's actually hilarious
34331620	34335700	I didn't know that had that effect. It makes me remember the banshee scream. Oh
34337380	34339380	I'm not sure I can even banshee scream
34339620	34344340	Like I can do it. Like my screams very loud, but I'm not gonna scream because I
34344980	34349540	I think after the rage, I don't know if one of the neighbors will probably try to listen in on me right now
34349780	34351780	And be like what is going on
34352900	34354900	Angry hypnosis ASMR
34355060	34359620	Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. I still prefer subspace
34362500	34364500	Just yelling get up
34367140	34373220	Right, um, they're gonna call the police on you. I've actually wondered if it's a possibility
34373780	34377540	I did speak to my neighbors at one point
34378660	34381620	And I explained to them that i'm a voice actress
34382260	34386500	So if they hear anything at night, don't be too worried. It's just me
34389620	34392500	So my voice acting's a bit different
34393700	34399140	Um, can you make a reward that you just scream Scotland forever Scotland forever
34399780	34404820	Passive aggressive ASMR guys. They're like, is she okay in there? Does she need help?
34406340	34409620	If someone clip that moment the clip will get but will get pretty
34411780	34414820	Oh the toothbrushing I'm gonna go get my toothbrush. Okay
34416260	34419540	I'll be right back. We're gonna if you want to get your toothbrush and brush your teeth
34420100	34422600	Before we go off-stream you can most certainly do it
34441620	34443620	I
34461380	34463540	Got one out of 21 days to brush our teeth
34464820	34466900	Like let me put my headset on so I can listen to the
34467620	34472820	Thingy right. I've got my toothbrush. It could be a sound pack from morning alarms. Just full bag pouch
34475300	34478500	I have toothpaste because I salivate a lot. I don't know about you
34478580	34481700	But whenever something enters my mouth, it starts to salivate like crazy
34481940	34484260	We're gonna brush our teeth and then we'll read into
34485540	34489460	Yeah, mercy. I was gonna call her mousy for a second. What she ate a mouse?
34490900	34492900	Are you ready?
34492900	34494900	Are you ready to brush your teethies
34495380	34496740	With me
34496740	34499860	I'm gonna do it for two minutes. Okay. That's how long you brush your teeth
34499940	34502660	So just start with the front of your teeth, right?
34503380	34507780	I see you. I do you want me to mute the game so you can like really hear the brushy brush
34509380	34511380	Yeah
34511780	34517140	I don't think you're gonna hear it over the thing. No, I will start a two minute counter now
34518580	34521860	Uh, oh, yeah, sorry. Let me mute the game
34522820	34527220	I was probably gonna break now that I'm out and it's tabbed out the game. There we go
34528340	34530900	Do you have a chatting? I do have chatting. Hold on
34532100	34535940	Uh, whoa, that's a lot of words to speed up one. Hold on
34537540	34542740	Uh, I got sorry. I've got toothpaste on my mouth right now. Pardon me. One second one second
34543220	34545220	I will do that and I do this
34547140	34549700	Okay, we're brushing our teethies
34552740	34554740	Hmm
34555060	34557940	Okay, two minutes of teeth brushing is a lot
34560420	34565140	Oh, no, you can hear my background music shift back my music you're ruining it. Uh
34569220	34573380	Wait two minutes so um 39 minutes past
34577220	34579220	Wait make sure you do the outside first
34579540	34586980	Oh my god, my shoe floor is quite all ready. Um, I don't think this is enough product paper
34597460	34603140	Okay, now the bed that most people mess I'm spitting everywhere. Hold on. I need more
34603300	34605540	Does that have a pillow in this room? I don't
34606660	34608980	I have so much saliva coming out of my mouth
34613220	34619540	Do the back of your front teeth and the back of your front bottom teeth that's the most forgotten science when you brush your teeth, okay?
34626180	34628180	I'll go cook some tea
34633460	34635460	I
34636980	34641860	We get no cavities over here. We get no how you call them
34642580	34644100	uh
34644100	34648100	What what are you called haemorrhoids? No haemorrhoids. No cavities
34649460	34651460	We are good with things
34652180	34654260	and we go that
34654260	34656820	Don't brush too hard on your gondola. We're free. I don't
34657860	34661060	No root canals. We don't believe in root canals in this house
34662020	34664020	root canal blood
34666820	34670500	Haemorrhoids, yeah, we don't have haemorrhoids in this community
34675860	34680420	Uh, I can't pull off because I don't know about the foster but we're just gonna brush our teeth in general
34681220	34683940	and we're gonna do it for quite one day in a row
34684900	34686660	and then
34686660	34695300	Everyone's gonna have a teeth brush and have it, okay? And life is nice and easy. Oh my god. This bit is going over the paper towel. Well, it's not on a toilet roll, but uh
34699380	34701620	Get the back of your wisdom tooth for you still got them
34704260	34706980	No, not mouth haemorrhoids booty haemorrhoids
34708100	34714180	Okay, and make sure you do circular motions. That's how you get all the the peas and poos off your teeth
34717300	34720020	Mm-hmm. Okay. I think I'm almost done
34725780	34730500	Is there a toothbrush out for a retailer? No, no, I don't brush in our teeth
34732660	34735620	Yeah, we're getting the because we didn't know
34737700	34742500	The reason why hold on I need to spit I'm gonna spit into my little mcdonald
34743460	34745780	Uh, crazy. Are you ready here there?
34749140	34752740	That's so much spit. I didn't need to generate that much, but I did
34757940	34759940	So minty
34762740	34768420	We did it. We have established day one of a 21 day habit of brushing our teeth
34769380	34773940	Thank you for the drink. No, not my used toothpaste, but
34778260	34781940	The only thing I don't like about toothpaste is that it keeps sitting
34782900	34787460	Like it keeps in your you're not to you're not to rinse that way, but if you need to spit it out like
34787860	34789860	Yeah
34793940	34795460	Okay
34795460	34798900	Did it we played the world's most annoying game
34800500	34804020	Right, I'm going to make triple sure I am redirecting into mary
34805860	34808600	Oh, I just minimized the tab by accident
34810420	34812420	Oh, I'm all docky too
34812420	34817060	No, that's mersey's umari stream
34819940	34823700	Stony cuttage a bit of stony cuttage
34825060	34829860	Thanks for the stream. You're most welcome. Thanks for hanging. Sorry for scared anyone to do apologize, but that
34830580	34835380	Sorry about that old chap didn't really mean to scare you did I? Oh, but just kind of came out
34836340	34838340	Kind of just came out
34838580	34840820	I said what everyone was thinking and saying
34841780	34845460	But uh, yeah, that game needs a hot patch for weapon drill. That's all I'm saying
34847380	34851380	It won't let me open the redirect thing. Why not?
34853300	34859140	YouTube you're so stinky sometimes it won't let me load so I can redirect into mary. I need to wait for it to load
34859380	34861380	Okay, I did it now
34861780	34866260	Oh tomorrow we have old school runesgate. Oh, I need to make my account
34866660	34869460	But what do I call my account is the question?
34871780	34872840	my
34872840	34874140	meaning
34874140	34877060	customization redirect add
34878980	34882260	A difficulty right into mersey say
34883540	34885540	Mersey
34887300	34889300	Good better work
34891540	34893540	Because
34894100	34900180	Right my little reeflings. I honestly didn't think we were gonna. I honestly thought we're going to end out four hours
34900180	34906020	but we've made it to almost 10 hours! Look at us go. You guys have so much stamina.
34907780	34911540	Wait, wait, can I try this out? Hold on, I don't know if I can try this out right now.
34912180	34914100	Is this gonna work or is this gonna break?
34920660	34925060	You did so well. You make me so proud.
34925220	34932820	You made such a long, unending stamina for me.
34934820	34935460	Did it work?
34939460	34944260	Did it work? Did I have a reverb effect when I did that? I don't know if that worked or not,
34944260	34949860	or did I mess it up. What do you mean, look at your skull? You're the crazy one who took
34950820	34955380	stuff. I'm feeling like it is. Yeah, the reverb was like, yes, it worked. I'm so happy.
34957220	34960580	If my voice wasn't so burst, I'd do a bit more, but it's burst right now.
34961860	34963460	Big burst, big burst.
34966260	34967540	All hail the glowfish.
34969060	34974020	It looks good when my eyes and my little shells, you can kind of see the transparency of my
34974020	34983460	shells a bit better like this. Maybe you can see my reflective thing going on. It works, so
34984340	34990900	wait, talk a bit. Okay, I'm glad it worked. Right, I am going to end it there without a
34990900	34997380	fantastic endurance room. Tomorrow is old-school runescape, so just so you know the plan, the plan
34997380	35008260	is that I'm going to make a new fresh account. You don't have to, but my idea was that we do
35008260	35015940	some questing to level up, and then we basically just have fun leveling up cooking and see where
35015940	35024740	it goes. But I'm a bit rubbish at quests, so it would be nice to try them together, like Cook's
35024740	35033060	Assistant. I'm sure there's a Vam, that haunted house quest. I can't remember its name right now,
35033060	35041780	but we're going to do those kind of questings, and then we can do some fishing together, and we'll
35041780	35050740	cook the fish outside of the barbarian village, because that's free, and we can cook crayfish for
35051060	35057380	free. I'm pretty sure you just need to get a net. Are you doing members? I think so, that's my only
35057380	35062820	issue. I'm going to buy membership, but I'll play, like I'll go into a free-to-play lobby, and we can
35062820	35071460	do the free-to-play quests, and take it from there, because I'm not entirely sure what the plan is after
35072180	35080020	that. I joined you on old-school RuneScape Sheebie. I hate to break it to you, my name's
35080020	35091540	Ronnie. My own tags level drain hypnosis. Yes, RuneScape membership. Time to make my account
35091540	35096980	tonight too. Yes, I'll share whatever we're on, and we can all go questing together, and we can
35096980	35101460	see all the reefling gang gang. I'm tired, it's pain. I know, I know what you meant. I need to go
35101460	35109220	sleep. The fangs are so much easier to admire this school. Yeah. Some people thought they were
35109220	35115460	vampire fangs, but they're not. You can't really see my ears, but they're slightly pointed. No,
35115460	35122100	pointy ears. I haven't played in ages, I need to learn. Yeah, we can all get like the same level.
35122100	35127620	We can all like hack the same yew tree when we're trying to level up our woodcraft.
35128420	35133300	Are you planning on playing something that follows 76? I think that's multiplayer,
35133300	35137780	but I don't know how to get you in my lobby. Like, how do I get reeflings in the lobby?
35137780	35144740	Or is it like, can we make a lobby code, and it's like a server like they host? I'm not sure how 76
35144820	35155620	works. Get bit by the fish, you wonder why? Would you let me bite you, reefling? That's terrible,
35157380	35163300	you should let me do it. Love your choice of games so far makes me safe to see where else you got
35163300	35168660	blood. Well, I'm glad you like the game so far. I'm literally just picking childhood stuff and
35168660	35175220	stuff that makes me happy. So I'm glad. But yes, old school RuneScape definitely
35175940	35182420	might be a recurring multiplayer for a little bit. I'm not really gonna, I'm not sure what happens
35182420	35189780	when membership, what membership streams are planned. I think we'll also do, I think three
35189780	35199060	membership streams a week possibly. One for react movie, one for membership
35201140	35208260	multiplayer. I'll decide. Like, I wouldn't do like progression on old school RuneScape
35208260	35214980	multiplayer behind a membership stream because that's not fair for those invested. So maybe,
35215140	35226100	maybe, maybe. I first played again yesterday for the first time, used old school RuneScape,
35226100	35231460	and a goblin got you, you got done at Goblin Village. A Dead by Daylight member stream? Yeah,
35232580	35238660	I'm open to these kind of things. But yeah, one, I want to consistently have a member stream
35238900	35249860	when membership's open. A react Andy, like we'll watch a movie together. And then I might also do
35249860	35255940	a script writing stream. Or maybe show you some behind the scenes stuff, like maybe we write
35255940	35260100	shorts. I don't know. I'm trying to think of like stuff you guys want to see. And then of course,
35260100	35267220	we could just like maybe smaller games that aren't necessarily stream worthy on main. So for those of
35267220	35274340	you who are unable to membership, please don't worry. I always have free content coming out and I
35275140	35280500	for days, like so you know how we played needy streamer overload yesterday? Because it was only
35280500	35286340	two hours long, like that's a short game. I would then come back online after maybe like a 30 minute
35286340	35291220	rest and then do a membership stream. So you still get like content that day and then like I'll raid
35291220	35299140	into whoever's online and like keep going. So yeah, don't worry. She streams eight days a week.
35300180	35305540	Yeah, don't ever worry. And like obviously the ASMR comes out as well. That's like free on YouTube.
35305540	35313700	You can watch on YouTube anytime. Script writing stream or submit scripts? Yes, it would be a bit
35313700	35321460	hard to review scripts live because I would need to use euphemism and stuff. That's nice as long
35321460	35327620	as you're not overworking yourself. I will make what I can handle and we can take it from there.
35328820	35336580	Yeah. Get that Hermione to rewind time and overlap herself streaming honestly.
35336820	35344740	True. True. I'll need to see eventually you'll be able to close your eyes and see her for a moment
35344740	35352340	and you're out watching. Yeah. Always on that. There are always streams. So yes, please never worry
35352340	35356900	if you don't have the money for membership because I stream every day and you can come see me every
35356900	35366180	day. And yeah, I'll make sure everyone gets their money's worth either way because I don't like
35366180	35371060	when streamers don't get their money's worth. Sorry, I don't like when streamers don't get their
35371060	35378820	money's worth. So that's just me. So yeah. Strony is a streaming beast. I'm sure she'll have something
35378820	35384340	for you. Yeah, I've got something for everyone. Or that's the plan anyway. Hopefully I got something
35384340	35393060	for everyone. So you're saying is I should never become a member. Only if you are financially
35393060	35400660	capable. And if you're only financially capable to support one person, I recommend doing my daughters
35400660	35410180	over me. Okay. Because I always have free accessible content. Always coming out. So yeah.
35412100	35414420	We love you, Strony. Please don't try my blood bliss.
35415380	35426900	Yes. You're such a good girl. I will skip meals to members. Stop. No, we're not doing these jokes.
35426900	35432900	I don't actually don't like these. There was like one joke that was like, oh, I'm like in a homeless
35432900	35438340	shelter. And then I've given you like membership or whatever. I'm like, no, it's actually probably
35438740	35445780	I am like so goofy and non serious all the time. Those kind of jokes are like, I don't like them.
35448020	35455940	I sold my kidney. You definitely have a few streams that I need to rewatch. I love it though.
35455940	35460900	Oh, they're long streams. You'll be rewatching for a while. But I'm good for putting on in the
35460900	35465700	background for a rambling. If you ever like, I need I want to listen to something in the
35465700	35470500	background, but I don't want to actually focus in. Yeah, just put the avatar stream on. And then
35470500	35476100	when it comes to the RDA part, we're going to start screaming my head off. My, my, my scarier.
35476100	35481940	But I'm looking forward to your first asterisk. I hope YouTube doesn't do anything. I'm a bit
35481940	35486660	worried, but I'm not going to be doing ear licking or anything like that. I don't know what the heck
35486660	35492820	YouTube's been playing at recently. It's making me nervous to even upload my like 1000 rewards.
35492820	35495460	And there's literally nothing wrong with that fricking audios.
35496660	35501540	Well, I just made a brand new or school roadscape. It's been years and I look forward to it. Yay.
35501540	35505860	I will tell everyone the server when we get on tomorrow. Like I'll put it on screen and I'll
35505860	35511700	say like, this is the world that we're in. And we'll start outside Lumbridge Castle where the
35511700	35516820	starting point is. I'm literally going to make an account, put membership on it and then
35518100	35522580	I get online for stream and we'll take it from there. I don't know what to name myself. So I
35522580	35527460	need to name myself something mildly humorous, but I haven't decided yet. Maybe Scottlefish.
35527460	35531540	That'd be nice. Oh, no, someone, someone. Ah, well, if you take my name, it's fine.
35531540	35536580	I don't know. I'll need to think of something. Do you have a place where you'll upload?
35538420	35542500	Monies for Vegemite. No, I don't have to try Vegemite.
35544180	35551140	I'll get Vegemite then for the hand cam stream. Thank you reluctantly saying I'll get Vegemite
35551140	35557060	in freaking toast. I don't even buy bread. I don't even get buy bread. Scottlefish is a good one.
35557060	35562340	Thanks. I stole it from a leafling. Thank you for giving me that. Wait,
35562340	35568740	do we need a membership on old school runescape too? Not necessarily for what we're going to do,
35568740	35573620	but I think if we, I don't know yet. Like I don't know. We're going to do some quests,
35573620	35578260	but I'm pretty sure like everything's behind a freaking lock and it's so expensive for old school
35578260	35582660	runescape membership. I don't know if maybe there's a rich reefling that's willing to buy
35582660	35590740	bonds and gift it to reeflings, but that's not like my place to ask for. It's a bit. I don't
35590740	35598020	know if we have any try hard reeflings on old school runescape. Like I think I have about 12,000
35598020	35605700	coins in those runescape, so I can't buy anyone a bond. Sorry. And I'm starting on a fresh account.
35605700	35609300	I don't know. Maybe we can like pull our money together to buy bonds to like share to reeflings.
35610340	35613620	Will there be, you're looking on Patreon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're looking on Patreon.
35613620	35619780	It's not a problem for me. Do what we want on Patreon. Do you have a place where you upload
35619780	35625620	words that you asked that and I read that out and then I didn't even reply to you? No, well,
35626740	35631300	the girls have been using Twitter and like putting a go, like a download link out.
35631940	35635460	Um, I don't think any of my content is going to get taken down because
35637220	35640740	I know the rules. I know how to scare them.
35643620	35648180	Um, so I don't think we're going to any any Oilers in chat, literally any old school runescape
35648180	35655860	Oilers. We summon you. I'd like to call upon you. My membership is still six dollars because
35655860	35661860	I've had an active substance. Wait, you lock in the same subscription price because you did it
35661860	35667300	all the way back then, but then you do that you're looking anyway. I can look this way.
35668980	35676180	She knows the cheese. Strone is never touch runescape. Unfortunately, it's like a really,
35677220	35681060	it's not a hard game. It's literally point and click. If you wanted to try it for the first
35681060	35686500	time, you can always start up with us. But if it's not for you, you don't have to play along.
35686500	35692260	It's okay. Please don't worry. I know you've been going for nine hours. That's crazy. Look,
35692260	35698340	I'm just going to yapping. Okay. I mean, I could check out Marshmallow and we can make it to 10
35698340	35703220	hours if you want. Like I could put my little Marshmallow link in the chat.
35703220	35709780	Ah, hee hee hee hee. Hee hee hee hee hee. Oh, my Marshmallow's in the description. Hold on.
35709780	35714900	I even have, I can't even see my screen right now. My stream, not my screen. I can see my screen
35714900	35721940	because it's right in front of me. Um, but hold on. How did I do this? How did I put it in chat?
35724420	35731860	I am about to sneeze. Boom. Oh no. Oh no, it'd be such a shame if you guys asked me questions to
35731860	35740100	round this up to a 10 hour stream. Stop. Stop it. We're right on the verge of 10 hours.
35741140	35745540	Oh, we'll count down to 10 hours, shall we? Only four minutes left.
35748020	35753460	Oh, I have a lot of Marshmallows. Whoopsies. Someone says, I'd love to spread your cheeks
35753780	35762580	in liquefaction. Oh, I wasn't supposed to read that part out loud. Hey, I'm glad you do.
35766580	35771060	God, your salty gamer rage makes me want to have hard, sweaty, angry stuff.
35773940	35776180	I can't read that one either. Um,
35784420	35788180	Hi, Stormy. Hopefully you're well. This is my first time using Marshmallow. Glad I could
35788180	35794900	pop your Marshmallow, Cherry. I don't know if you read any of these. Oh, I read all my Marshmallows.
35796500	35802580	I have a few questions. You stream so much that I'm wondering if you'll be taking a break from ASMR.
35802580	35808660	No, I'm streaming ASMR in two days. No break from ASMR. I've got ASMR cards coming out as well.
35809220	35812980	I just need to write the scripts and send them off. Let's go again.
35816820	35821140	Yeah, I've got time for ASMR all the time because, yeah, I also got loads of managers in place.
35821140	35826740	So the only thing I need to do really is be the messenger owl that sends clips to editors now
35826740	35831140	and uploads stuff on behalf of the girls. Like, Mercy just wakes up and she's like,
35831140	35836980	got new shorts on her channel. She has no idea. That's me doing it. Actually, Emmy has another,
35836980	35841540	is that short? Yeah, Emmy has a short and she's just going to wake up and it's going to be on her
35841540	35850980	channel. Already tagged up and everything for her. Yeah. Unless I didn't read that right.
35855860	35862180	Yeah, I know how my ASMR is going to be. I can also upload full videos to Twitter as well if
35862180	35866740	anything ever did become an issue. Like, if I did a little ASMR video. So it's not a problem.
35867380	35872900	The level organization is astounding. I saw the girls aren't stressed. If the girls had to stream
35874340	35878100	and they had to run around and worry about trying to get clips out and shorts out,
35879300	35890580	not good combo. Not nice. Not nice. Oh, no, wait, what? Hi, Stroni. Feel a bit embarrassed.
35890740	35901860	Oh, no, it's okay. Someone says they feel embarrassed because they messed up in chat at some point.
35901860	35907380	Don't be silly. You're allowed to mess up in chat all you want. I can't even write in English.
35908180	35915300	Like, don't worry. Like, Emmy had a script where she had to say a putty cat and I accidentally typed
35915380	35920900	P-I-S-S-Y. Like, don't be afraid of making embarrassing mistakes. They're not embarrassing at all.
35921460	35925300	Actually, you only feel embarrassment if you let yourself feel embarrassment or something like
35925300	35930980	that. It's something about psychology. Like, if you make mistakes. Yeah.
35933460	35937860	Viewer girls trying to find a non-lid marshmallow and read on stream impossible. It's honestly
35937860	35942340	not that bad. I don't get that many. I honestly don't get that many. Like, the girls show me what
35942340	35948500	they get and I don't seem to get, but I haven't been using the other Twitter. I think once I
35948500	35957140	start using it properly, then. Yeah. Question for you. The other day we talked with Castle
35957140	35961060	Green Brotherhood about how you're the mother of the girls and the reeflings are the father.
35961700	35964900	Does that make Emmy or a daughter or sister or a daughter or sister?
35972660	35980500	If you're a reefling, then technically daughter or sister, but if you're not a reefling, then it's
35980500	35989140	just a little sister. New audio idea. Anger Scots woman mounts and rides you after being
35989700	35992500	all day as a fellow Scots nun. We're hotter than here and so on.
35996660	36001380	So I listened to the Assassin's Creed stream and I was happy that you remembered me. I'm
36001460	36008580	like, yeah, you're like the main clipper. I actually didn't ask that question. I think there
36008580	36012180	was someone else who made a few clips as well. I thought I'd be making clips and posting them,
36012180	36017220	but I wasn't too sure if I could use that. Oh, no, you can go. Brother, that's your channel. You own it.
36018180	36024020	You make custom content. You have made new creative content. Then guess what? Copyright is
36024020	36027060	in your favor. Don't worry about copyright, okay? You don't have to worry about copyright
36027380	36030660	or are you joking me? Clip the girls away. Have fun. Have that ye.
36032420	36037700	I'm friends with a guy who's already itching to draw the fan art. Fan art of who? What door?
36037700	36042740	What door is getting fan art? Please tell me. I want to know. I love seeing them get fan art.
36048260	36052340	I like with the Olympians better, better not think about the family.
36057060	36065380	What type of hypnotism is your favorite?
36071780	36078740	That's too hard to answer, honestly. I like hypnoloss. I really like hypnoloss,
36079460	36083780	where I'm supposed to hypnotize you, but they're backfires and I do as you say.
36083940	36091620	Ah, so good. Any chance of a spiral let's play? I've never played spiral like that before.
36091620	36095060	I would like to try it. I'm pretty sure they remastered them and they're like nice,
36095060	36098980	calm, friendly, casual. It seems like something that's like cameo-esque,
36098980	36101940	where it's like nice and simple to get through, so I think yeah.
36102820	36109700	Hmm. I would say yes overall.
36112580	36118180	It's the one where you go into like a difference or am I- am I messing up for subspace? I may
36118180	36126900	mess you up for subspace. Hold on. Hey, story. I'm probably being a dumb dumb and I haven't
36126900	36130180	found them yet, but I was wondering if you could get reference sheets for all the girls chat
36130260	36131540	mascots. Yes.
36134900	36145460	Amy's chat mascot is in her debut stream. You are the light in my dark. You are the beating
36145460	36152900	in my heart. I showed you yesterday. I should get a reference sheet from them all put together.
36152900	36160260	Maybe I'll get a tweet from the bee alone. Hmm. I can't because Amy's is in a different art style.
36164500	36172100	Hmm. I know what you're asking for. I don't know the best way to do it. Maybe the discord can post
36172100	36180580	them. Maybe the discord should have a reference sheet for all the girls and their mascots.
36180580	36187140	That might be the solution that we can come to. Would you like to come together on a solution?
36188260	36191300	Or would you like to come together? Hmm.
36194020	36197620	I'm a little late but congrats on the debuts. Can't wait to see you and the rest of the girls
36197620	36201380	having store. And it was nice hearing her Scottish momay again. Glad you're back.
36201940	36207860	Sincerely a H little Rajesh boy. Oh yeah. It's good to be back terrorizing you.
36210900	36213460	I cannot wait. I cannot wait for the A's in my stream.
36215220	36219620	Thanks for being so funny, amazing and cute. You make my day better in all its aspects. I wish
36219620	36225460	for you and the girls eternal success. Thank you for such kind words. That's so nice. I'm glad
36225460	36234340	you somehow found me funny. Because yeah, literally, yeah, it's not good. It's hard to make jokes. Okay,
36234340	36242260	my first one. Oh yeah, there's an official discord that has notification only. None of the girls
36242260	36253300	are in it. So remember what I said in debut 2.0. You don't groom us. We groom you. So none of us
36253300	36256900	are in it. But if you want notifications for when we go live and all that.
36259460	36263460	What does it say? I need to push you against the wall holding both your hands above your head.
36266740	36273060	Uh, am I supposed to say this out loud? I don't know if I'm supposed to say this out loud. I don't
36273060	36278420	think I'm supposed to say that out loud at all. By the way, along with the zinc supplements,
36278420	36283780	I've started eating celery for you. Oh, celery is mingin, though. Thanks for your sacrifice.
36283780	36287380	They taste between boring and bitter and I don't like them, but I'll persevere for you.
36288340	36294580	Are you sure you eat? Even I draw the line at celery. Sorry. It's so tasteless. I don't understand
36294580	36303060	how it was even. And that celery has been genetically selected to produce like that.
36303060	36308180	The only way celery is redeemable is in a soup because it's got stock and completely covers
36308180	36318180	the taste of celery. Your dedication is appreciated. Celery sucks. Celery is a peanut butter delivery
36318180	36326260	device. Oh, like a spoon. Celials worse though. I'm going to zail them up,
36326260	36333940	form down. Hold on, I'm just grabbing some water. I need to hydrate.
36342340	36351540	I have been hydrated. Oh no, it's 2pm already. Oh, it's my bedtime soon.
36352500	36359060	Oh no. Wait, no. Actually, it's good that it's my bedtime soon because that means I get to be on
36359060	36363700	old school Rinscape with you even. Wait, actually, I just realized we're doing a first freaking
36363700	36371140	stream snipe game tomorrow. Oh my God. Why did that not register? We've literally been talking
36371140	36375140	about old school Rinscape. We get to play our first freaking stream snipe and I get to see you all.
36376020	36381940	Ah, oh my God. Okay, I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. Oh my God, it's tomorrow. I want to
36381940	36387940	go to sleep right now. I'm not going to be able to sleep. It's like Christmas. It's like Christmas.
36388500	36393620	I'm going to be so excited. Are we all going to like have code names? I don't know. Should we have
36393620	36400420	theme names? Are we all just going to name our names like how we are? Five. I'm just going to see
36400420	36405780	this right now. Someone says hopefully you will play five hours. Five hours? No, we're doing 12
36405780	36412020	hours. Okay, 12 hours or go home. So I'm going to give everyone as much of a chance as possible to
36412020	36418500	show up in old school Rinscape. I will put the world we are on in the top corner or something
36418500	36426500	so you can see it any minute. What is Rinscape? Rinscape is an old web game. Is that a web game?
36426500	36431940	I don't know if it's a web game now. But yeah, if you have trouble falling asleep,
36431940	36439220	just look in a mirror and hypnotize yourself. True. I'm aware that's below your average.
36440340	36446660	The most Rinscape players average on the game. Oh, do they had enough after five hours? Me just
36446660	36451380	like, right, let's do a fashion show. Everyone go to the Grand Exchange and get some pretty cold
36451460	36458020	dawn. I'm going to rate who has the best. Oh wait, there's houses and can I bring you to my house
36458020	36464900	in Rinscape? Right, I don't know how membership works, but I'm pretty sure you can get house
36464900	36471700	in Rinscape because I remember watching someone play hide and seek in Rinscape and he was like
36471700	36477300	chasing around like the people in stream. We can play hide and seek in tag in Rinscape.
36478100	36487620	Oh my god. Yeah. And it has this one's go. Oh my god. Oh my god, could we play hide and seek?
36488260	36492900	I want to be the seeker and I get to touch you all. And if you're touched, you have to like go in
36492900	36500820	the corner until the winner is crowned. We really are getting crowned. I've never played Rinscape,
36500820	36503620	but whatever hint you're describing, it sounds very close to Oji Cup Penguin.
36503700	36512820	Oh my god, I want to play tag. And I'll be like, right, run away from, oh no, who's that? Oh no,
36512820	36515940	but we won't be able to know who's that. So we can go to the hide and seek. Okay.
36517220	36519940	Shawnee, if you phrase it like that, everyone will like touch them.
36521220	36526580	No, no, you're not wanting to get caught. What if we use our Rinscape beds next to each other?
36527540	36534020	I sadly can't start a new game. I already have three games that take full time and one of them
36534020	36540500	I play. Well, World of Warcraft. Someone was like, well, I say something. They were like,
36540500	36544820	I'm no longer doing wow raids to watch your streams. I'm like, no, your girls are going to be so
36544820	36550100	annoyed at you. Like I've had the chance to play World of War. What was the expansion called?
36550820	36558820	It was like the second last expansion of wow. And I had a chance to play it. And apparently,
36558820	36565060	people role play in this place called Goldheim. And I'm like, should we play wow and just like
36565060	36572260	be like really weird role players that I like. Shadowlands. I think it's Shadowlands is why
36572260	36580020	played. No, not the battle. Not the battle about the dwarf. Oh, okay, brain needs to catch up. Hold
36580020	36586260	on, hold on, brain needs to catch up. Not the battle of Azeroth. Goldchart and something like that.
36586260	36591140	Yeah, the gold chart and we should all go role play there. I would like make like make people
36591140	36597460	really uncomfortable and we're all just like role playing. Wow, ascension is a thing. I don't know
36597460	36609460	what that is. The elf and her dwarves. Oh, wait, what would we be? Can I be a cute night elf and
36609460	36619700	then you guys could all be wargans for some unwritten reason? Pop Tropica is still a thing too.
36619940	36621940	Pop Tropica.
36625460	36634020	Guild Wars 2 role plays were at, I don't know, Wink Wank? Really Wink Wank? Oh, wait, wait, wait,
36634020	36642900	do that again. Wink Wank? Really Wink Wank? Did that, did that work? Oh, no, it doesn't work.
36642900	36648820	Wait, for some reason the sound works on my freaking game. Hold on, we're like Wink Wank.
36654260	36657780	Here we go. Wait, that played twice. I don't know why it doesn't do it on the screen. That's
36657780	36664820	strange. It's the same instance. Oh well. Sorry, that took me so long to do. We should be orcs and
36664820	36670980	you should be an elf for no reason at all. Oh gee, I sure wouldn't love to be overpowered.
36671220	36675540	I take a drink of hydration of water. To hydrate.
36679460	36685060	Hi, good morrow, dear silly cuttlefish. I'm very sleepy, so I'mma be brief.
36685700	36688420	I absolutely adore watching yours. That's okay, shame! And today,
36689620	36694420	and it's been so unreal to watch you be all silly again, I absolutely adore you and I hope all of
36694420	36701300	you are girls and I absolutely adore you and your hopes for the veal or girls and everything and I
36701300	36705700	hope you all make it happen for your happiness as mine and I'm always kicking my feet, blushing,
36705700	36713700	tapping and stuff. Thank you for making, thank you for such kind words. Got you twirling your hair
36713700	36719220	and stuff, huh? Got you twirling your hair and stream. Are you and the girls ever going to play
36719220	36726900	Minecraft together? Yes, July is when the group Minecraft server goes up. Amy, definitely the
36726900	36732500	most Minecraft-y out of us all. I don't know how the scale goes, but I'mma confidently say I'm
36732500	36739620	probably the lowest on the scale of like Minecraft knowledge. All I know is that apparently the mob
36739620	36747300	votes are the vote, people voted for the freaking stealth phantom things. If you don't sleep for
36747300	36752500	more than two days they attack you through walls and stuff and I know that was the mob vote and
36752500	36760260	apparently the mod vote is also rigged because it doesn't make sense. I don't know, but I don't
36760260	36768660	know if it's rigged. I think it's because people don't understand like kids will vote and kids don't
36768660	36777140	vote for things that are like good. They vote for what kids want and maybe that's why the votes are
36777140	36785380	always so skewed. Yeah, mob vote's terrible. I tried and voted for the crab. Wasn't there not
36785380	36790420	like an alternative? I can't remember. I assume Mercy and her motion sickness might be a bit
36790420	36800820	of a struggle. Yes, Mercy... I would love... it's hard. I don't know if Minecraft would set it off,
36800900	36807220	although she can change the camera so it might not affect her motion sickness.
36807220	36811700	I'll need to ask a bit more about it because I don't have it. I don't know what kind of like
36811700	36817300	sets it off all the time. Kids running around... I can't believe it. Kids ruling the way that kids
36817300	36821940	game isn't used. Terrible. I hydrate again. Oh my voice is feeling it Mr. Krabs.
36824820	36828900	I'm pretty sure you can move out your camera angle. Can you not on Minecraft or am I just
36828900	36836100	making that up? Does it look cool? Never stuck with him forever. Yeah, I will agree. The design
36836100	36852500	of it looked cool but its actual thing in game is rubbish. Like rubbish. What does that mean?
36853060	36858260	What are you asking me? Forgot to send this. Thank you mommy for all your girls. So cute.
36858740	36862420	I wanted to mention that. So many people are like thanking me for like
36863380	36868340	the girls being the girls. I'm like no, you thank the girls. I didn't do anything.
36869060	36874660	If you're thanking me for picking them. Again, that's the girls that did that. It was through
36874660	36883220	either their introduction or their own content. It's the girls. It's the girls you should be
36883220	36892500	thanking. Not me, you goofy gobers. It's the girls. So thank the girls. The reason people
36892500	36897460	say that the vote is rigged is because Compton created tell people to vote for a certain more.
36897460	36904340	Therefore, I picked the vote. Compton. Compton. Who's Compton? Sounds like a town in London
36904340	36910420	somewhere. Or a bottle. Sorry, a bottle in London. You picked an amazing bunch though. They're all
36910420	36918580	awesome. I'm glad you agree. There'd be nothing short of perfect. As in they are perfect. That's
36918580	36923940	how you say they're perfect, right? They're nothing. They have been nothing but perfect.
36923940	36926900	Yeah. That's how you say it. Yeah. Okay. Man of heat and ghosts.
36927540	36941060	Wait. Oh, no. Right. You guys are welcome to laugh. I think this is terminology I'm not familiar with.
36941780	36952340	If I see a pest trooper, what's a hollow live home? What's a needy male? What?
36952740	36959540	What's that? Am I being dumb? I don't know what that is.
36961940	36965540	They're asking, do I have, am I able to shadow ban them?
36968180	36972180	Maybe this, no. Maybe this, no. I don't quite understand it. Sorry.
36972500	36990260	Why is someone sending me a detailed, no. Is this far and on? Is this toilet bowl far and on?
36991780	36998420	Oh, ye gods, how I wish for that most delightful of noise to curl into mine deprived ears. With
36998420	37005380	such intensity, I yearn to experience the sound of Strawny's splutter gutter as it
37006260	37017380	flaps a flutter, the noise like a walrus burping up butter, the harps and splurts like a chorus of
37017380	37027140	angels unleashing their art, the pungent bass bass that can only be played alongside golden harps to
37027140	37033700	shepherd the dead whom has come and died when hearing Strawny's fart. That is so toilet. There's
37033700	37042900	no way you're not toilet bowl and on. Just for very quick lore, someone ages ago sent me a thing
37042900	37047540	and was like, I really want to hear you fart on the toilet and I'm like, what? You want it to be
37047540	37055060	amplified by echoing off the rim of the toilet and from then he was crowned freaking toilet as bowl
37055060	37062580	annulment. I don't want to miss what cursed filth hath the eye brought upon, hath the eye
37062580	37069700	brought upon these lands. Hi, my love, I want to, hmm, in me right in front of you while you
37070340	37076660	hold her hand. Careful what you wish for, you might be getting it. You might be getting it
37076820	37085620	all the girls actually, possibly. There's, hmm, yes, I need to, I need to see you.
37088820	37094340	He wants to hear the reverb full acoustics, literally. Well, they wanted to hear that
37094340	37102660	chock. You're only allowed to hold hands with the harps, even better. I have a plan for my
37102660	37109380	Dora Thon, but it requires a team effort and it's quite a lot to ask the girls like, oh, Dora
37109380	37112580	Thons are like, you need to help each other out, type them, but I'm going to try my best to make it
37112580	37122660	as easy as possible. But I would like to release a certain audio and basically, in it, I give you
37122660	37131940	a pill that negates any need for a pause champ, if you will. And then I take you door by door.
37133380	37140660	It's so messed up saying how loud. But yeah, and I tell you like all the good things and encouragement.
37141300	37153860	I need to, I need to let it cook. Okay. I need to let it cook. And I need a Dora Thon in the
37153860	37158500	first place to even start cooking it up. But we ain't there yet. We ain't doing that. We aren't
37158500	37165380	even on that part. Well, that's a very silly pill. Lord, grant me strength. Would you please give us
37165380	37174100	a heads up for when it comes out so we can save? Oh my God, mon. Please do that. She kicked a whole
37174100	37184660	six course dinner. I'm a gourmet chef. Well, if I get 99 cooking on RuneScape, then yes, I am a chef.
37185300	37191380	Confirmed. Any plans for haptic support? I keep getting asked, but I don't know what it is. I don't
37191380	37196260	know what I need to do to the audience to make that happen. I don't know if it's like I run it
37196260	37205060	through a data thing or what? I don't know. I don't know. I'm too dumb. Hold on, I'm gonna
37205060	37214420	fix my calibration and I'm wiggling a bit too much. Okay, calibration, calibrate it.
37214820	37222180	Are we cooking in RuneScape something? Yes. I don't know how to make money in RuneScape,
37222180	37228340	but we're going to be buying lobster so we can level up. If not, we'll use Barbarian Village and
37228340	37235140	we'll pick up all the salmon, all the bought strobe and cook. Shawnee, do you reply to
37235140	37244260	marshmallows privately? No, I don't. I reply on stream or I put together a mosaic. A mosaic?
37244420	37250740	Is that the correct word? Where I put all the pictures together and post it. But I've only
37250740	37257140	done that once. I should maybe do it again sometime. And then I can talk about all the naughty things.
37258340	37258660	Why?
37261780	37265940	Here's a funny story about three medieval kingdoms. I'm scared to click on this piece.
37266660	37274580	Hey, Staroni, I love your work. Any chance to do a belly button camsuit? No, you don't
37274580	37279060	like to see my belly button. Why would you want to see my belly button? I don't like my belly button.
37279780	37288180	Belly button? Belly button? Is that your choice? Is that your choice of finishing location?
37288740	37293060	Hmm, your choice? Interesting.
37295940	37298420	Good night, Staroni. Just thought you'd want to know I'm going to jet.
37300420	37304020	I can't read the end of that. Enjoy your nighttime routine. Sleep well.
37305940	37307860	Oh my. Oh my.
37310820	37313300	Hi, Staroni. I want to hold your body again.
37318260	37326660	Oh. I can't read any of these. There's a free game called Fantasy Star Online 2.
37326660	37330180	I haven't played it in years, but every weekend there's a Hatsune Miku concert.
37330180	37334260	That's so specific. Why is there a Hatsune Miku concert in the middle of Fantasy Star Online 2?
37335140	37338900	I'm thinking Miku, Miku, Ui, Ui.
37341060	37345220	Blue air, blue eyes, hiding in your wi-fi.
37345940	37349140	Staroni, I just want to let you know for old school runescape, being on a member's world is
37349140	37352980	almost a requirement for any skill training. You can quest together with people and free to play,
37352980	37356340	but the gameplay is limited. Oh, but it's so expensive.
37359620	37367060	Stop reading them out loud. Ah, I like reading them. It's only me, or is it me, seeing a lot more
37367940	37369940	things than she would.
37372420	37376500	Eh? Are they both on? No, they're not online right now. You mean in the ASMRs?
37383140	37387380	People are bored. Bold on Marshmallow. Yeah, that's the best part.
37388500	37394180	They tell me everything they want, and I give them everything they want.
37395140	37396420	That's a good exchange.
37400020	37400900	Can you please say...
37404980	37407300	What are you gonna use it for if I say it?
37408980	37411620	And you didn't tell me what tone to say it in either.
37414100	37417300	You didn't tell me what tone to say the sentence in either.
37420020	37422500	I need to think. How would you want me to say it?
37424580	37429940	Mmm, I lost the game. This? Is that the tone you wanted this?
37431380	37436100	If you want me to say something, you need to give me tone. You need to give me the emotion.
37447140	37449620	Wait, strong enough. Wait, what?
37449940	37450440	What?
37453460	37459700	Wait, is that that goofy game where if someone says you lost the game, you've lost us?
37460420	37467220	Wait, is that what it? Rip game players. Wait, what does it mean? It's a silly game,
37467220	37471620	right, where people say I lost the game and then you lose it until you win it on your streak?
37472420	37474500	If you think about the game you lost, okay.
37475380	37479540	The only objective of the game is to not think about the game.
37479540	37488420	Oh, okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just made you all lose. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking that far ahead.
37488420	37492740	I'm sorry. I didn't think that far ahead.
37495300	37499300	Can I suggest something secret totally say so confession maros to read on stream?
37499300	37501860	Yeah, you can like, you can literally type in the maros right now.
37502180	37509300	Can I send it like this? Did that work? It did. Yeah, you can just put it in there.
37509300	37512260	And if you want me to say something, just put that emotion and then like,
37512260	37516180	like quotation marks. I'll also take requests here in the ASMR stream as well.
37516180	37520020	So if you ever wanted me to hear it, kind of whispered a bit on a different microphone,
37520020	37527940	because this is an SMB7 I'm using. At least we lost this drawing. I heard about this like
37527940	37536180	25 years ago in elementary. My discipline. I'm sorry. Okay, I distract you. I will say other things.
37538500	37542500	Did you see the refling zip up hoodie design? Maro, I send other deer. What do we bear?
37543060	37547300	Oh, if you've got those, if you've got those kind of pictures, please send on Twitter.
37547300	37554900	But I will say my Twitter tags are freaking working. I'm trying to find this freaking artwork
37554980	37559140	on Smuttle and it doesn't show up. I don't know why it doesn't show up.
37563060	37565700	What's your favorite type of hypnotic induction to use?
37569220	37578500	I think, I like repeated pattern. Come to the ASMR stream and I'll show you what I like. Okay,
37579220	37585140	deal. Huh? Are you going to show up? And I'll show you what I like. She will like.
37585860	37590100	And people are going to judge me, but I like it. So I'll do what I like.
37590820	37593940	Sometimes the Strony is a good girl. Hell yeah, a good girl.
37595460	37599700	You, oh, I'm good at advertising. Okay, I'm in. I'm in. Hey Strony, here's the song.
37599780	37606340	Safe for work, Mario. Do you have a throne? I do, but I've unlinked it because
37608420	37613380	I have everything I need now that I've got my reef links. I don't need a single thing else.
37616820	37622580	And that's the 12th. I don't need anything. So I've unlinked my throne.
37623460	37630260	I'm going to say how many triples have you received so far? Um, not a lot.
37630260	37634660	The girls are getting a lot more than me. I think the reef links are a little shy,
37634660	37638900	a little shy, a little scared. Will you and the girls be able to
37638900	37645140	yourself and members streams? Most likely, yes. Strony, does it make you happy when people send
37645140	37651140	you the spicy messages? Please let me. Please tell me all the scenarios you want to do to me.
37652580	37660580	Are there any games where there's an alt path you haven't tried?
37662980	37667060	I can't think of any off the top of my head. I normally probably like
37667060	37672740	game starts, game ends. I never pick the bad team if there's a bad side. Stinky.
37674900	37677780	Unless you count the companions in Skyrim.
37678100	37685140	Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?
37686420	37689940	Oh wait, I'm on the fricking wrong thing. Sorry, hold on. Let me try that again.
37689940	37692020	Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?
37695380	37698660	Yeah, exactly. That's what I thought. That's what I thought. No one likes them.
37698660	37704820	Companion. Stinky. Yeah, exactly.
37706900	37712260	You think they're fine? I don't, I never, although the first time you play it, it's like,
37712260	37720740	wow, really good, but the fricking on Xbox, the girl always glitches out and disappears in the
37720740	37726420	middle of the map and she never comes back. Hi, just a time waster for cute fish.
37728820	37732900	Someone says, someone says, wife? Husband?
37736980	37743300	Have you heard a joke about afar? It stinks. You know what? You're done. Wait, why?
37744100	37748100	Oh, there's no background. No, no, no background. What's going on here? Why the heck do you know work?
37759300	37768420	Oh, right, I think that's all the marshmallows that I can, I refresh and it's just gone up my quiver.
37773540	37776980	Oh my god, I love you and the girls so much. I created a Twitter account just to follow the
37776980	37781540	six of you. I hate that I had to turn into it. I know. Thank you for going through it. It's such a
37781540	37785860	pain. My account keeps getting fricking locked and it keeps making me prove that I'm not bought over
37785860	37789380	and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Look, I just want to look at
37789380	37794980	small fish. I want to, and then I want to go to sleep, you know what I'm saying? Hi, Johnny.
37794980	37798580	Oh, sorry, I don't know why I gave you that voice. I'm so sorry. I apologize. Hi,
37798580	37803460	Stronny. I woke up in a Euro time zone and found out the party was still going 10 hours in the
37803460	37809700	avatar stream. Hell yeah. I really admire your energy and autism as you call it. Thank you.
37809700	37814180	If you want to play old school RuneScape tomorrow, we are going to be live for 12 hours. Cheeky
37814260	37820100	endurance stream. What's that? I stream more in one week than the average we should have
37820100	37830500	done in a month. I'll wear that with pride. So I don't have snot coming out my nose. I'm drinking
37830500	37840340	water. Your wishes. Hi, Stronny. Thanks for being a butt. So,
37842740	37853620	okay. You can finish the rest. Stronny, guess what? You just took my marshmallow
37853620	37858100	of engineering. Get plapped. Get plapped. Get plapped. Looking forward to the old school
37858100	37862580	RuneScape. I also recommend Final Fantasy if you want more MMOs. Also, would you accept
37862580	37869380	script ideas, fan-made scripts? Yes, I would. I don't have a problem. There may, at a later
37869380	37876660	date, not now, not in this month, things need to settle where we can take official script submissions.
37876660	37885700	However, if we are aware to take subscriptions submissions for audios purposes, sadly, you
37885700	37890820	have to fully hand over the rights. So we have the right to monetize. We have ownership.
37890820	37897540	We're happy to give credit. I think, I don't know if there's going to be a problem giving credit.
37897540	37904020	I haven't thought that far ahead at the moment. But there's a lot of issues and it's quite a shame
37904020	37909060	and it's really hard to iron out at this point in time. But once the dust settles and things get
37910020	37912660	better. Wait, get plapped. What are you doing to us? Blap, blap, blap, blap, blap.
37914980	37919220	Do you still have love for the big boy wiflings out there? I can't help but notice a
37919220	37925140	lane in your lore video. Yes.
37928340	37931780	There's just something I've got to say. You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.
37931780	37938740	Oh, thank you. That's how to train your dragon. That's one of the only books I write as a child.
37938740	37943220	I think I read like three books as a childhood. And one of them was how to train your dragon.
37944340	37952740	I don't know how I read a book, honestly, but I did it. She's dunking us in the water.
37954340	37959380	The books were so good. Literally one of the only books I read as a child. I've read more books
37959380	37967380	this year than I have in my entire life, which is crazy. I'd pretend that I can do book reviews,
37967380	37970660	but I'm not even smart enough for that. I'm currently trying to get through the Handmaiden's
37970660	37976420	Tale. I actually am enjoying the Handmaiden's Tale. I'm like a few chapters in, but I don't
37976420	37981540	know if people find this cheating, but I have to have the book read to me or I can't read it.
37982980	37987620	This sounds really bad, but it takes up too much brain power to read the words manually,
37987620	37995860	so I read along whilst being spoken to by TTS voice. And I can speed it up like super fast.
37996820	38000420	Oh, thank you for the raid. How did your stream go?
38002340	38006260	How did your stream go rain? Oh, you might be tired, so don't feel forced to talk.
38006260	38008580	Don't feel forced to talk if you're a tired little barbie.
38010820	38014180	I should have said background music. It's really quiet in the stream. I don't know if it's
38014740	38019460	maybe nice. I hope your stream was good. Endurance streamer, creative director,
38019460	38023060	and so has time to... I've not read any books since debut. I can tell you that much.
38023060	38027940	But hi, Raiders. I'm Strony Cuttlews from Via Lure. I'm really inappropriate,
38027940	38031460	so I do apologize if I'm new. You're a cup of tea, and I'm also Scottish, so I'm super hard to
38031460	38037380	understand, but thanks for hanging out anyway. Which is... I hope your stream went fantastic.
38037380	38041540	Please rest up after your stream. I'm sure you're tired, and last thing you want to do is get
38041540	38046900	bombarded with loads of questions from the person you have kindly rated into. So I thank you kindly,
38046900	38055300	rain cloud, and I hope you have a fantastic rest after your game. Game? Maybe that too.
38056260	38063140	Never know. May not be a game. She may not be... Entry all in one breath. She's got lungs.
38065300	38069940	Strony looking to push 11 hours at this rate. Should we? Should we just yap and then make
38070020	38076740	it another 12 hours? Why is the raid message wait? Wait, I saw it as wait as well. Like,
38076740	38080500	I could hardly read, but I had to scroll over. I mean, if I make another cup of tea,
38081380	38086420	we could in theory make it 12 hours again, and we just like... And we can just talk,
38086420	38090500	and I can ask you questions, and then you ask me questions, and then I'm going to ramble about
38090500	38096580	something, and then you distract me. And then we're going to another ramble. Do you want that?
38096580	38101700	Yes, please? Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. Her favorite form of introduction is tying you
38101700	38108260	into the cannonball fall streak. The yabba-nay. You feel yourself getting so sleepy, don't you,
38108260	38117700	little leaf-ling? Yeah, it's okay. Let's sleep and brace you slowly, okay?
38118420	38129220	Shhh. And then here for 13 and then 14. I mark my words when and if YouTube ever
38129220	38136980	fix VODs, 14 hour streams. Not even kidding. I can't get enough of you. I can't. I can't
38136980	38147620	get enough of you. And when we do Elden Ring, I am incredibly tempted to possibly figure
38148420	38155620	do a 12 hour and then raid into a six hour afterwards. I don't know. It's plausible. I'll
38155620	38162340	be a tired bean. I don't know. I wish we could get 14 hours. 14 is the like perfect slot of like,
38162340	38169380	I can still get a full night's rest. Lord, inject the Scottish lass. Lord, if you can
38169380	38175940	hear me right now, inject the Scottish lass into my veins. Scott Fish is too powerful.
38175940	38180580	Thank God it's daytime where I live. I don't have to sleep. Stop. I can't be more addicted
38181460	38190340	than I am. You're too good, Strawny. I'm coming for you. Trying to kill us. Thank you.
38191540	38197300	Do rest if you need to rest. Never worry, okay? Strawny, I've got to go to sleep. Can you please
38197300	38202100	show us those pretty pink swirls? Oh, now that I'm so close to you, I absolutely can. Hold on.
38203060	38209300	Uh, will I go in? Wow, I'm reacting to myself. Please don't react. There. Okay, that's more like
38209300	38216740	me. Hold on. Let me put chat behind me just for a moment. Okay, let's see if I can do this properly.
38217540	38224420	Sorry, I'm so close. Okay, let me move my water out of the way so I can at least attempt to do
38224420	38230340	something mildly professional for once in my life. Okay? Once in my life, I did something
38230420	38231780	a little bit. Oh, maybe a little bit.
38238740	38250100	It's okay to be sleeping. It's been a while since you've rested. Well, really, okay?
38250980	38252980	Shhh.
38255860	38262740	Slowly, your phone. Slow, slow, slow.
38266020	38272820	And your muscles relax. Slow, slow, slow.
38273620	38284260	And your brain is quiet. Slow, slow, slow.
38286980	38292500	Good name, but don't be stingy. Until the morning.
38292580	38304020	Did I do it? Did I do it right? Slow, slow, slow.
38305220	38310740	Until the slumber you fall, I tell you. I don't know if I was too close because I might hold.
38310980	38317300	But I need to show her. Seems like you did.
38320020	38323860	A little sleepy moment. Thank you so much. Good night.
38330740	38333780	I just woke up. Can I put you to sleep again?
38334100	38343060	You did great, good girl. You can't catch me off guard. I've already been called good girl.
38343060	38348660	Good luck getting me in subspace. I'm in dumb space. When I do hypnosis, I feel very dumb.
38353700	38358500	It's early in the morning. We need a bedtime ASMR. Absolutely. I am more than open to that.
38358580	38366580	We can absolutely do bedtime ASMR. Am I allowed to go for a tinkle and a cup of tea as my voice is
38366580	38373460	croaking like a frog? And then we'll just ramble until the 12 hours? Does that sound like a deal?
38377060	38378420	You made my boss fall asleep.
38378820	38389700	Super early. Hi, Stronny. Tanner is in... I'm getting a frog.
38394740	38400660	Thank you very much for the tiff. I'm glad you liked it. Oh no, my Elden Ring. My stream elements
38400660	38405780	is gone. So I can't freaking shoot you. Stream elements. Stream elements are so finicky sometimes.
38409380	38412100	Oh, I'm already logged in. Go to my dashboard right now.
38414180	38419860	Let's try that again. Shall we? My fraud, my fraud phone call. I can't believe that they're not
38419860	38425860	getting any, not getting it from me. Thank you, Beryl, for the tip. I appreciate it. I'm glad.
38427540	38434340	For our good dumb, keep it up, mom. Yeah. Right, I'm going to very quickly go make a cup of tea
38434420	38438900	and do a quick tinkle. You are... I'm actually going to pin my...
38443300	38451460	Rain cloud. Please rest well, rain. Okay. And sleep well. I'm not gonna force you to talk. Okay,
38452580	38461620	I'm actually going to pin my... Any questions? Question mark? Did that work? Yeah, it did work.
38461620	38466660	I'm going to pin it. So you're welcome to think it, but please rest well, rain. You work so hard.
38467380	38472020	And you did fantastic. Hi, Stronny Tenors, Polk. Happy first week. This was my first rain.
38472660	38479300	Oh my god, thank you so much. There's so kind of you. Oh my gosh. I'm glad I could take your rate,
38479300	38482820	Cherry. Am I allowed to say that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I'm not allowed to say that, but I'm
38482820	38489940	glad I could take it anyway. Okay, I've pinned that. I'm going to go make a cup of tea. I will be
38489940	38493860	roughly three minutes because it takes three minutes for the kettle to boil. It takes three
38493860	38497860	minutes for the kettle to boil, yeah? So you're welcome to ask me any questions of any variety.
38499380	38502900	But please sleep well, rain cloud. Thank you for the rate. I really appreciate that.
38502900	38508820	I need to add you on Discord, actually. I need DM, the whole Umi Plus squad, actually,
38508820	38514500	and get everyone on Discord. And then once I have access to you on Discord, the possibility.
38515460	38524180	Right, I'll very quickly mute and I'll go and make a cup of tea, okay? Okay, cup of tea time.
38524180	38530180	Tea time. Oh wait, I'll do that. I'll close my eyes first. Oh wait, close eyes. I'm not very smart
38530180	38532180	whenever I do that. Never mind.
38994500	38997620	That time we brushed our teeth and I was like fully ready to go bed.
38999940	39006980	Yeah, yeah, remember that time? Yeah, okay. I entered the room with a cup of tea. My tongue's
39006980	39012660	sticking out. I was like, yeah, what time? Yeah. I mean, do we need a brush or two
39012660	39016180	twice now? I don't know. You're not really supposed to brush it like too much.
39016980	39026900	Yeah, I just got caught up. Apparently, shebe's alternative Twitter is over 10K followers,
39026900	39031780	so what the heck just happened whilst I was streaming? I don't know what I've missed,
39031780	39041300	but congrats girls, oh my gosh. Right, shall we? Shall we get to the bottom of it?
39041540	39044260	Oh, she offered feet for 10K.
39046340	39051540	Shut up. My toes are out right now. Hold on, I'm putting Goop on my toes right now
39051540	39061780	for the money shot and everything. She has lovely feet. True. Yeah, she left the containment zone.
39061780	39070020	Oh, okay, she componds, she componds. Right, let me refresh these marshmallows.
39070020	39072340	Ooh, I got 20 more questions. Thank you for all the questions.
39077300	39081380	Some reason it shows marshmallows from like a week ago at the top. I don't know what that means.
39081380	39085460	Does that mean someone's verified is like put it up there on purpose? I don't know how it works.
39088900	39094340	My stream disconnected. Why does OBS do that? I said OBS disconnected. I'm still here.
39095060	39100980	Stream. You give me a heart attack every time you freaking do that. Please don't do that.
39103060	39107940	Oh, I just get notifications that says OBS, you've disconnected. I'm like, please no.
39109220	39114820	Please no. I'm trying to make it to the 12 hour mark, please, please. We're only one hour away.
39116980	39121540	Someone said, oh yeah, you can request me to say stuff on my accent by the way. Someone says,
39121540	39132500	please can you say ravioli in a seductive tone? Ravioli in a seductive, ravioli, ravioli, ravioli.
39134260	39137940	That little sleep hypnosis thing you did was amazing. I'm convinced you'd be amazing at a
39137940	39142900	meditation type sleep bottle. Yes, I want to do like bedtime hypnosis stuff as well, like completely
39142900	39147860	like fine on the table. You haven't even started your hypnosis content yet and you're already
39147860	39155780	infiltrating my mind by turning my internal monologue scotch. I can't wait for you to turn my brain
39155780	39165540	into your bin, into your female doll. Oh my. Ever since you've debuted, I've gone from a man lost
39165540	39171940	in a desert drawing of thirst to one drowning in a flood of nonstop good times. Yes. And all I want
39171940	39177060	to do is just close my eyes and let the waves take me. Would you drag me into the depths? I want
39177060	39184980	you to. I'm glad you can have good times here. It was, it was dry for a while but I hope, I hope
39184980	39191860	it's good times here, good vibes. Yeah. We go swimming together, you know. I playfully dunk
39191860	39197780	your head under the water a little bit. Just playfully. And no other reason. No other lower
39197780	39205460	related reason. It was awfully cold in the depths but now we're in warmer waters I think you could
39205460	39213860	say. Can you run from Prime Minister of Australia? So at least through, if it's bad ideas, it sounds
39213860	39221140	nice coming from me but I've not even been granted rights into the country yet. There, there is a
39221140	39228580	timeline where I get rejected and I can't, I have to go back to Scotland and I can't run the business.
39228580	39235300	Let's hope we're not on that timeline. That would be terrible. Could you imagine if I got kicked out
39235300	39247540	of, oh my god. Munga, munga. Uh, hi, Strony. I don't know if it's been answered already. It's okay to
39247540	39252340	ask something you're not sure that's been answered. It's not possible for someone to be here all the
39252340	39256260	time so please don't ever be afraid to ask a question you think that's already been answered.
39256900	39263060	It's not possible for you to be here all the time. I know, I know it's terrible but it's not possible.
39264020	39268660	Sorry if you did but I just want to know if you're interested in the game Lost Planet 2. It's on
39268660	39272580	Xbox and I think you'd like it. Could easily play the whole thing in one stream. Also, you
39272580	39279220	played Elden Ring. Would you be open to playing Armor Core 6? Armor Core 6 has been popping up over,
39280420	39284980	I've heard the name a few times now. Love your streams that I can't wait to bounce those hypnotic
39284980	39294260	eyes back on you. Stinky. Armor Core 6. I don't know what it is but it keeps coming up.
39295140	39300580	Lost Planet 2. I should actually write down game ideas because I trust your guys's like
39301300	39304260	suggestions over anything that I could possibly come up with.
39304980	39312420	8c6. It's phenomenal. It's great. It's really good. Highly rated game.
39314260	39322340	Not my. Every strongy tone has it's synced up. No my default. I feel like my default and I'm
39322340	39327460	like that and I'm all monotone. Like you can't even understand. Lost Planet 2 is an OG Xbox game.
39327460	39332980	How did I never come across it then? I don't know when it came out. Maybe it was still at
39332980	39338500	the stage where like so I used to get attached to one game and when Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
39338500	39347940	came out like I hardly got any new games. I got Skyrim, I got Black Ops, AC Brotherhood and the rate
39347940	39358740	of like new games like went down astronomically. If it's probes of 2006, 2008 and then Armor Core
39358900	39363780	6. I'll definitely, these games keep coming up and I trust your guys's judgment.
39363780	39366740	Hi strongy, I was curious if you would follow guys's chat one day.
39368180	39373860	Yeah, of course we're doing the jelly bean game. Are you silly? Are you being a silly sausage? Of
39373860	39379780	course we're playing the jelly bean game again. How else are you gonna touch me and grab me and
39379780	39390500	hold me back? You guys wouldn't stop grabbing me. You all grabbed me. You stinky stinker things.
39391300	39395860	Ah my calibration is having a hard time today. Hold on. Let me re-calibrate.
39399060	39406100	Hopefully my mouth stops wiggling. Okay it's not wiggling anymore. Jelly bean game.
39407060	39412580	We do what? So in the jelly bean game you can like grab opponents and hold them back
39412580	39419060	to like stop them from jumping to the objective or whatever and I used to have to beg. I was so
39419060	39426580	bad at the game. I would basically have to beg till people would hold back to let me through the
39426580	39434100	first level because I ended up losing it so many times that I wasn't playing the game and I respect
39434100	39441300	it and you guys play because I was that freaking bad at the game. That is so much fun. So yes you
39441300	39449220	will absolutely be playing that again. I will always do like a stream snipe game every month.
39450180	39456900	One that's like public and one I do prioritize free to play games. Unfortunately I've started off
39456900	39462820	a rune scoop which normally premium is the only way to play it so I've picked a bit pearly.
39463780	39468820	I do apologize but I would like to get 99 cooking and it would be fun to kind of like
39468820	39475620	achieve goals along the way. So going strong girls. Strony what type of fan are you like the most?
39478820	39485380	Any. Like whatever inspires you. Like some people do like a meme funny moment. Like I uploaded a short
39486100	39492500	and like in the short I was like and yes before you ask and I went back in the like the bagpipes
39492500	39498020	and like the Scottish flag appear behind me and then someone liked it so much they basically made
39498020	39503780	a Scottish beam come out of my mouth and like the first panel was me going and then the second
39503780	39509220	panel was like I was like throwing this Scottish beam out of my mouth and it reminded me there's a
39509220	39516020	trend on how it's the Mika world and she goes Mika no no this time you've been waiting for see
39516020	39523060	two one Mika Mika beam and it reminded me of that and it's so good. Like whatever you enjoy
39523060	39526580	like if you enjoy meme make a meme if you enjoy the other side of things you're more than welcome
39526580	39533860	to make the other side of things because I like that stuff too. And yeah like anything 10 hours
39533860	39540660	deep let's go yeah we're gonna make it a 12 hour stream uh so I'm just ranting ranting rambling
39541220	39546340	for the last uh hour hour last hour. I've got a little cup of tea don't know if you can hear
39546340	39552340	my nails on it. I'm just waiting for it to cool down before I can sip it. Stroney any chance of
39552340	39559540	you making a 2D platform video game in the future that's so specific why are you wanting to bounce
39559540	39568020	on me in 2D? I'm I'm not making a video game no. I have plans to make video game in the future
39568020	39574900	but that's the future future like now meow. What should a lad do if he makes a fan made album?
39574900	39581940	What should uh sorry make a fan made album? What should he send us general or art?
39582500	39591780	What does that mean? Fan made album? Album? Like a music or am I being dumb? I'm in it for the
39591780	39596580	long haul today I'm here we go I'm oh please don't stay up if it's gonna be bad for your health
39596580	39605940	I don't want you to do anything bad for health okay see me I can be up for 12 hour stream because
39606660	39608100	you know Rottos and Mirona
39612260	39620580	a rap stuff oh my god can you do a diss track on me? Stroney cuttles more like Stroney can't make
39620580	39632420	her mind up. Uttles on her 15th persona. Muttles got tape on her tape the only reason she's a
39632420	39638900	VTuber is to give herself boobies because she ain't got any in real life yeah whoo diss tracks
39638900	39645380	Stroney diss track no the diss tracks yeah that's right you're getting diss tracks again oh I just
39645380	39652740	punched my knuckle against the desk by accident someone says I kneel you are too powerful so much
39652740	39661700	kneeling I like it do it again it is humbling to know someone like you exist I've never dumped so
39661700	39670820	much ink before within a span of a week and from it so happy from watching you and the girls I
39670820	39676340	hope for your success and it's one of the few I feel that is deserved oh thank you so much thank
39676340	39683860	you for spilling your ink I do like hearing about ink spilling like why yes maybe I am a V sucky after
39684020	39695780	oh maybe there is sucky by blood the pause after hearing where I live it smells like freshly baked
39695780	39700180	cookies because I'm near a cookie factory and I'm and I'm already awake for today we're still going
39700180	39706260	strong oh that's dangerous for your health it's dangerous to be awake for more than like 16 hours
39706260	39714740	I think is when it's bad like your brain function your cognitive function goes down like big big
39717140	39724500	I knew it velar is going to be my oval my version of meet the grams will be meet the indulgers
39725220	39731380	what did you think about the generation name indulge because if I told you technically if I
39731380	39738580	told you a secret this is a secret for only who watch this stream right now um gen one's name
39738580	39748900	indulge plays into gen two and three um and if we do get to three gens oh I'm gonna be so excited
39748900	39758820	because to reveal the full names because they all play into each other and I'm so excited I wonder
39758900	39763220	if anyone could guess I don't I think it's impossible to get there's too many variations like
39764420	39770180	someone says is there a chance for a stream of a software game other than Elden Ring I don't think
39770180	39778740	I can get any help in the other Elden Rings though however I think she be as interested in Bloodborne
39782900	39788100	but unfortunately I'm not very good and the reason I like Elden Ring so much is because you
39788100	39797300	guys can come in and help me but I'm not good on my own um three gens worth the tubers I will become
39797300	39804340	a husk I'll become a husk honestly maybe we can guess after the second gen
39804420	39809940	um
39813140	39819700	oh no you can't guess it because there's two secret words that aren't present
39820580	39828340	it it forms a sentence basically all three gens perform a sentence that perfectly encapsulates
39828340	39837140	won't be where it is indulge marionette and you're like nah yeah you're no the secret words
39837140	39841460	makes it impossible just wanted to drop one more marrow I've watched all the velo girls and well
39841460	39847780	I like them a lot you're my oh thank you are you sure I'm your oh she though like I'm not gonna say
39847780	39853460	anything but like Emmys T's and Oof A.C's accent like I'm not killed and she sounds so
39854100	39861140	fucking adorable and her accent I wish I could copy it but I can't why is she irish I see why are
39861140	39868740	you irish I don't know I just love the way she sounds but I feel like I'm doing a terrible
39869300	39874580	that's terrible you have your own accent power power
39875380	39884820	sure well the sentence will look good but what gen no I am not I am absolutely not doing any further
39885620	39890100	so there some people were like are you doing a spin-off gen are you doing like a safer work
39890100	39899300	variation no I've absolutely no interest I am exhausted I took so much HP damage getting gen
39899300	39906660	one out I am very thankful to say that if gen two and three do happen the HP damage is reduced
39906660	39915700	significantly because I learned so much I learned so much and when you do the first time you do it
39915700	39923860	it's so hard but anytime after it just gets easier but I am I have no interest I feel like absolutely
39923860	39931140	no shade or anything to any other VTuber agency if you start throwing gen after gen it is very
39931140	39938260	clear you do not give an absolute rats arse about the content for your girls and it's just it's
39938260	39944260	such a shame that those girls put faith in you as an agency and your response is throw another gen
39944260	39951140	out throw another no absolutely no no very disappointing I don't like that that's just me

40130820	40138420	me courage hi stroney saying this is the Scott so when I say this you know it's not just because
40138420	40142900	of the accent I love your voice listen to you up on stream is my favorite part of your stream and
40142900	40148100	when you talk gently it gives me tingles I'm really looking forward to the ASMR wait I can give you
40148100	40154820	tingles just when I be a bit more gentler in the morning that's interesting normally I like I only
40154820	40162500	happen in the the thing the thingy goodbye those who are sleeping I gotta go finish up work have

40189620	40196740	uh yes it's one of the main things I'm interested in I want to take full control
40200500	40206740	the question is can I put you under though I'm I'm a bit unskilled at the under part it's scary to
40206740	40212500	put you under because I'm not sure how good I am at it and as well I don't know if the accent is
40212500	40218500	actually a debuff on putting you under a spell or the control type section of it so I'm a bit worried
40219460	40224900	we'll see what happens as I said I'm learning and you guys have been fantastic and it will be
40224900	40229700	like you guys are always fantastic and give me like a lot of space it'll take time to get

40650660	40656500	how does it feel to know that you have me addicted to women of Scottish accents it's over for you
40657780	40669140	it's over for you you crave the rolling ours you crave the in luck and most of all you crave the
40669220	40674580	smell of iron brew on the breath of the woman you've just kissed
40677700	40682340	you're you've been scot-pilled and there's no turning back
40684340	40693460	the peak I'll say oh should she still go ahead yeah we've got another t-minus 40 minutes uh is
40693540	40698340	mercy going to be online in 40 minutes I never thought about that
40701780	40708180	already had a taste for the Scottish accent it's uh bettish I'm sure no one
40708980	40714820	but found out when I have my scot-pilled oh yeah yeah she's still online okay um before I go offline
40714820	40720420	please remind me to make sure that mercy's like still actually going to be online if not I'm probably
40720420	40729460	going to redirect you into one of her songs I'll make you listen to ac's furry cover thing
40730980	40738660	xt nestle pouses on your ooh you so warm I love emmy's emmy aces
40738660	40743380	frankly the right the reason why I get ac and emmy mixed up all the time is it because they both
40743380	40748500	begin with I is because I used to call them the twins in development they were called the twins
40748580	40753700	in development I know they're not twins they I just called them twins it just happened okay
40753700	40758980	so emmy and ac always get referred to each other by accident now there's few problems with my
40760980	40769140	if you had a chance to change your oh I changed forget changing fate I put it into my own hands
40769700	40777060	and I am strong it calls the cullfish of the war
40780820	40785220	sending them out to say that you and emmy's are my favorites it means incredibly talented
40785220	40789780	and entertaining and she's an absolute sucky mom but there's something about you that makes you
40790580	40796100	so easy to listen to it's probably because you can tell how low IQ I am so I make you feel safe
40796900	40804580	see mersey's a dork so you lure your guard around her but me because I'm brain dead yeah
40804580	40811860	you can't help it you can't help it thank you for the kind words kind kind of mark
40813780	40817300	warning for stream let's see how far I can read into this before we can
40818900	40825060	as you stare into your reeflings eyes to hypnotize them you get a little too close to one and catch
40825140	40834260	your reflection in the eye you suddenly feel tired and a desire to bend to their oh good girl
40834260	40842500	cuddles you want to give everything to your little reeflings stop oh my god you're no I can't read that
40843300	40848100	I need to finish reading that though
40853460	40858020	no I can't read that no I can't read that it's gonna change my brain thinking right now I can't
40858020	40865060	read that oh my god excuse me mom I am sure you're my oh yes thank you
40865620	40869460	take it that's it ever said that Mario has made the seal of

40892020	40899700	subspace another another time but not not no subspace no subspace all right I bite it
40902900	40907940	because if no the problem is if I go into subspace I can't talk I literally can't talk
40907940	40913220	how am I supposed to entertain if I can't talk if I'm just here squealing like a little
40914100	40925140	picky subspace emissary reference subspace emissary reference no subspace is a thinking type
40926740	40931860	and it makes it really hard for me to freaking talk through it it's really freaking hard

40989300	40995940	to do it with one another because latency wouldn't be an issue um I have to put your stream schedule
40995940	41001060	on my desk to make sure I remember I'm so bad I apologize if people use Twitter for notifications

41888260	41894660	your streams are so long yeah uh streams are completely impossible for vod watchers it's uh
41894740	41898100	pretty crazy unless you kind of use my streams as like something to listen in the
41898100	41903620	background as you work it's like impossible for vod watchers to uh get up to date
41905300	41911300	I always miss streams because of work oh work is so stinky you're telling me capitalism is in
41911300	41920420	is the reason why I don't have more ink we will destroy capitalism I want all the ink
41920500	41927860	like vod watchers they lose and unfortunately with a streamer like me vod watchers are very rough
41929060	41936260	what happens in 20 minutes I go offline we reach the 12 hour stream mark where the vod blows up
41936260	41945940	if I go one second after 12 12 hours so I have to go sadly oh I've been drinking cola I can't
41945940	41955620	brush my teeth you're not to brush your teeth for 30 minutes because of the enamel sorry we did
41955620	41963460	technically brush our teeth today so I didn't do a bad job just a rubbish one if it reaches 12 hours
41963460	41970740	weeks but literally the vod just self combusts clips will come in for the wind for these long

42372020	42376980	starting to lose it mildly honestly considering how delirious I normally get at the end of the
42376980	42382980	stream that really wasn't that bad considering it was just an accent but if you didn't pick up on any
42382980	42388740	of that sin sister and myself have bought shock collars and we were going to play Elden ring
42388740	42394580	together and whoever causes us to lose the battle and perish we get to shock each other
