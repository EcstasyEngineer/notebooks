10000	11000	My life.
11000	16000	I hope I'm on the right thing.
16000	18000	I'm done.
18000	20000	I don't know if I missed it.
20000	22000	Who's driving this boo?
22000	27000	Because my voice is so messed up.
27000	32000	Valor.
32000	34000	Am I streaming?
34000	38000	I don't see it.
38000	40000	There'll be a live for 40 seconds.
40000	42000	I can't even see myself.
42000	43000	Oh, there we go.
43000	44000	Hey, I can hear myself.
44000	46000	I totally lost my voice.
46000	48000	Testing.
48000	50000	Oh, freaking scary.
50000	55000	Broke my damn voice on that bloody stream.
55000	60000	Did you like it?
60000	63000	From here on out, it's nothing but scuffing memes.
63000	65000	If you're looking for professionals,
65000	66000	go elsewhere, buddy.
66000	67000	Go to Shibi's stream.
67000	69000	There's no happening here.
69000	70000	I promise you, mate.
70000	74000	My voice is so strange right now.
74000	75000	Oh, my goodness.
75000	76000	Just the way we're like,
76000	78000	oh, it's been a bloody while since we've been together.
78000	79000	Fuck me, man.
79000	82000	That took me a year to spawn this.
82000	84000	Oh, my God.
84000	85000	I did it, though.
85000	88000	Holy shit, we did it.
88000	89000	Feet sniffer.
89000	90000	I didn't mean to imply greed.
90000	91000	No, you didn't.
91000	92000	I know you didn't.
92000	93000	Please don't worry.
93000	94000	Please don't worry.
94000	95000	It's fine.
95000	99000	The only reason I say greed is because of the perspective thing.
99000	102000	Oh, fucking mischief, reflins.
102000	105000	My fucking god.
105000	108000	What a year it's been.
108000	109000	Holy crap.
109000	111000	I know I'm supposed to talk about my debut,
111000	115000	but let's be honest, we're all reflins here.
115000	117000	Oh, fucking mischiefs.
117000	120000	Of course, your names were going to be refling.
120000	122000	Oh, my God.
122000	126000	What do you mean you became a squid VTuber just so your name
126000	129000	may only reflect you in another life?
129000	131000	Oh, come on.
131000	132000	Refling.
132000	133000	Come on.
133000	135000	Get it?
135000	136000	Great barrier.
136000	137000	Reef.
137000	139000	Reef.
139000	144000	Oh, I'm so excited to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood with you.
144000	149000	When this stream ends, I'm going to unlist all my streams.
149000	151000	Any reefers on the track?
151000	154000	Are reefers cannabis?
154000	155000	I can't say that.
155000	160000	Does reeflings mean something different?
160000	163000	In another life, I had a fan base called Reeflings,
163000	166000	but it was spelled slightly different.
166000	172000	And I made it pronounced the same, but spelled differently.
172000	174000	Yeah.
174000	175000	Don't worry.
175000	176000	Don't worry.
176000	178000	If you're not really familiar with me from the past,
178000	180000	don't worry about it.
180000	181000	Okay.
181000	182000	Don't worry about it.
182000	184000	I'm just strong at cuttles.
184000	185000	Let's keep it that way.
185000	187000	Thank you very much.
187000	188000	Okay.
188000	190000	Am I actually going through my 2.0,
190000	192000	or are we just meaming about it?
192000	194000	Are we just squidding around?
194000	197000	Are we just squidding around?
197000	199000	My bottle.
199000	201000	I have my reefing mail.
201000	202000	Skullfish.
202000	204000	Oh, Skullfish is so good.
204000	207000	Oh, that's actually really small.
207000	209000	Okay.
209000	210000	Thank you.
210000	211000	Right.
211000	213000	I'll actually go through my slides,
213000	215000	but I'm not really sure if there's much of a point,
215000	220000	because, well,
221000	224000	that's 2365 from Vsuck.
224000	225000	Bomet.
225000	226000	Product or Bomet.
226000	227000	Right.
227000	228000	Let me drink my cola.
228000	229000	Let me drink my cola.
229000	230000	Yeah.
230000	231000	I was supposed to say 53.
231000	233000	Also, someone doubted that Scots is a recognized language.
233000	234000	It is.
234000	237000	So, you know how it sounds like I'm speaking English here all the time?
237000	239000	I'm going to give you a sentence.
239000	240000	Okay.
240000	242000	I'm going to type it in chat so you can read it.
242000	243000	Hmm.
243000	244000	Hmm.
244000	245000	Hmm.
245000	246000	Hmm.
246000	247000	Hmm.
247000	249000	Hmm.
249000	252000	So, that is the sentence in Scots that I've just typed.
252000	253000	Okay.
253000	255000	And it says,
255000	257000	Are you coming to my bit tonight?
257000	259000	That means, are you coming to my house tonight?
259000	261000	That's Scots.
261000	263000	See how it's a bit different?
263000	264000	It's not in the best sense,
264000	266000	but it's what I can think of with the top on the head,
266000	267000	but yeah.
267000	268000	Are you coming to my bit tonight
268000	270000	means, are you coming to my house?
270000	274000	And I purposely don't really speak with a lot of slang
274000	277000	or mumbled the way I naturally do,
277000	279800	because I'm quite naturally monotone and mumbly
279800	282680	because the problem is
282680	287400	you guys don't understand me because I'm scottish
287560	294680	but if you are british or you're familiar with the scottish accent
294680	297960	then I probably actually don't sound from scottish indeed but
297960	302280	it is what it is and also I've been very like
302280	306920	when you're on the internet you're very americanized because of what you consume
307320	311320	does it take all your efforts to pronounce every syllable and not speak scott's
311320	318360	no I'm my mother dearest she actually taught me
318360	325640	she discouraged me from speaking in slang
325640	331000	so I doesn't always naturally come out but
331080	334680	um here's hoping it's the beginning of something
334680	337400	fucking cheers to that mate cheers to that
337400	340680	but yeah uh technically legally on paper
340680	345160	because I was born in scotland I could speak two languages thank you
345160	349240	neneath any help from jewel lingo let's go
349240	354360	uh but yeah so I'm a siren that can't sing
354360	358120	gee willikers I wonder why I just don't have a voice I'm also tone deaf by the
358120	361240	way so I hope you're ready for drunk karaoke streams
361240	368360	uh that stuff's gonna be uh intense let's see where these slides are
368360	371960	so both of your parents are scott's
374280	378600	um yeah the the band aids hold up
378600	385240	still top tier yep very top tier uh mongolian throats singing
385240	387960	the reason I don't like mongolian throats singing it's because cats don't
387960	391400	like mongolian throats singing because of the vibration it's an
391400	396840	unpleasant sound I have learned many traits of cats so I don't like it
396840	403640	drunk karaoke uh shebe's doing drunk ASMR this week uh if that's your
403640	408360	is that your heng to say is that your thing in scott's you go
408360	413960	is that your heng is that I is that your heng oh it is heng
413960	420760	and there you go um yeah I did some basic stuff
420760	425400	oh my lore's being retconned by the way thanks to you guys
425400	432120	uh apparently my weaknesses are mirrors which are really like
432120	435640	uh I'm I'm definitely gonna do something with that because I think it's
435640	437880	such a cool thing I should have done it like a
437880	441320	character reference like strengths weaknesses because that would be so much
441320	445560	cooler to do but hey hold I actually have started reading this year um I
445560	448680	had a really rough year last year gee wonders oh wow
448680	455080	um and I started uh I picked up reading I have never read in my life um
455080	461080	and turns out I really like the stopian novels like George Orwell was so good
461080	465240	like Animal Farm in 1984 I absolutely love 1984
465240	469160	Fahrenheit was good like they quit I've read the classics I'm not read that much
469160	474360	but uh um I see you're reading right yeah
474360	479720	um the women in the dunes as well is like the perfect
479720	486280	like book because it like encapsulates like human nature
486280	492760	and oh I just love like depressing books I love being depressed at the end and
492760	496520	being like no humanity didn't prevail no not humanity
496520	501320	what's the word uh human nature like didn't prevail against the odds
501320	504920	I've got the hobbit I've not read it yet but I have the physical
504920	512840	copy of the hobbit and I'm so excited um yeah I'm not much of the the girls by
512840	516360	far are more weebs than me I am by far the gamer
516360	519880	like I played the most games doesn't mean I'm good before anyone fucking
519880	522760	complains because every time you mention you play games
522840	526600	uh what do you mean you're not top 500 in this game
526600	531160	you suck like no I play video games fucking relax I bet you're
531160	534600	shit at them too like my god can you hear yourself
534600	539160	you're actually like so fucking negative anyway I'll help you get more
539160	542600	positive actually the reason why you're negative
542600	546040	is because your kd is negative because you're scrubbing the game
546040	549960	that's why you just project anyway that's just me
550360	554520	music I'm really generic with music I don't listen to music much

1533000	1536440	I'm like um you guys are probably sick of staring at these games
1536440	1541720	um I did that no I think I've done this wrong
1541720	1544360	hey hello
1544520	1548360	uh I think I said all the game stream said yeah oh we're playing old-school
1548360	1553000	Rinscape 8 hour Assassin's Creed brotherhood lore
1553000	1556040	coming in what have I done probably like
1556040	1560680	less than an hour but um
1560680	1565320	yes probably uh old-school Rinscape uh is our weekend game it's going to be
1565320	1569480	mostly a multiplayer game for this month until
1569480	1577880	June 19th when the Eldon wait why the fuck is there two
1577880	1583800	oh I must have missed one um you've never played Rinscape don't worry
1583800	1589160	we're doing questing my only problem with old-school Rinscape is
1589160	1592760	I think you have to pay the premium experience for premium
1592760	1596120	or we're all just going to get shafted playing that game like
1596120	1599880	not in a good way um but yes Eldon Ring
1599880	1604040	Eldon Ring DLC comes out on the 19th and then the multiplayer game for like
1604040	1606920	four days in a row I'm doing multiplayer games
1606920	1610760	you need to teach me old-school Rinscape literally I just go like fishing
1610840	1614360	the back of Lumbridge let me castle not the back
1614360	1619720	next to the main but south of the castle um
1619720	1625160	but I uh what was that single word of fun oh uh probably four days of multiplayer
1625160	1629320	Eldon Ring and then I have a very unique stream come in
1629320	1632920	with the first collab outside of Vealor at the end of the month
1632920	1640520	with a feature called Sin Sister and we may or may not have both purchased
1640520	1644680	shock collars which we will give each other control of the shock collars
1644680	1648840	and we are going to play multiplayer Eldon Ring and whoever causes us
1648840	1653560	to die whichever one causes us to die gets to shock them
1653560	1658680	basically yep we are we're doing that um I believe
1658680	1662760	Sheebie is also getting a shock collar so I might have some sort of stream with
1662760	1668520	her relating to that uh I use a shock collar for
1669000	1671720	DEMPA
1673800	1678120	but yeah my goals are pretty much I want to do 100 days smart clubs with the

2031560	2035720	your throat your tentacles please the reason why
2038200	2045240	reeflings have a patch on their head is a nicotine patch to help you with your
2045960	2050360	addiction because we have an addiction to one each one of you to each other
2057320	2060920	yeah so that's why you have a nicotine patch and you have lovely tentacles
2060920	2063960	I've already got lots of suspicious artwork of us together but it's for
2063960	2066760	November so I can't post it yeah to match it I've
2066760	2072760	absolutely cooked on the lores um background yeah I love my room uh odd
2072760	2077080	top was such a good sport I literally sent them a DM I'm like
2077080	2081080	hey can you base it off of sonic ost and you go
2081080	2086520	um waltz with me he did my little banner that's on twitter which is really good
2086520	2088520	absolutely do it
2090280	2094440	Azura could help you all with her healing properties um
2096760	2104040	uh oh really yeah small sushi she did great um small sushi actually she did
2104040	2109160	fantastic because she the girls weren't fully conceptualized when she created
2109160	2114600	them I basically just gave descriptions which was really rough I know you
2114600	2121080	haven't seen my stingers for my scene transitions I hate stingers I spent like
2121080	2128520	200 dollars and I don't even want to use them I like I bought it obviously I bought
2128520	2133160	it for everyone else but I'm like why did I spend that money on me no one feel
2133160	2137640	well I don't like using stingers I like just went straight into it and like my
2137640	2143640	loading screen was so expensive actually Yuri you may cooked with the loading
2143640	2148440	screen she's actually making another alternative version because I had to do
2148440	2153800	that cover-up thing but that was very expensive as well
2153800	2157880	I just like when I get into it and then obviously why I picked my gen
2157880	2164600	mate yeah that was so fun to do um like everyone's like oh this is my first
2164600	2170120	impressions no mother fucker I picked them
2170120	2179160	are so fun it was so fun being able to say that and being like yeah yeah absolutely
2183000	2188120	evil strongy be like I always use stingers I love stingers I love when v-tubers
2188120	2192200	have 10 minutes of stream starting soon at the start of their streams perish
2192200	2197240	absolutely perish nonsense I'm starting up on a brotherhood at the menu
2197240	2204120	tomorrow mark my words um but yes
2204120	2208440	uh I was just fantastic the girls
2208440	2212200	it's hard to judge people when they apply because
2212200	2219160	it just felt really um we're weird
2219880	2222440	hold on
2223480	2230840	hold on um yeah it felt weird trying to put put them on because some of them said
2230840	2236520	put me on any model some of them said I wanted a specific model I think Azura
2236520	2239080	got who she wanted
2241560	2244600	she'd be
2245080	2252680	um Mercy wanted AC AC wanted AC so AC got AC
2252680	2256680	Amy did you see anyone
2258680	2262360	anyway it's impossible to give people the outline that they wanted because they
2262360	2266200	couldn't even see it like it is they couldn't even see it it was just an
2266200	2271560	outline um did you have any awkward or weird
2271560	2277080	applications uh someone's intro video was
2277080	2281480	30 seconds uh for anyone watching if you're
2281480	2287080	serious about joining a vtuber agency uh what you're supposed to roughly do
2287080	2291720	in uh application introduction video is to say
2291720	2295640	your accolades whatever you achieved as a streamer prior to
2295640	2300600	what you're doing now so you mention how often you stream do you stream three
2300600	2304040	times a week consistently good thing to mention
2304040	2310360	um 30 seconds uh just it was like hi i'm
2310360	2314280	and i stream on and that was it and i was like bro what am i supposed to do with
2314280	2317880	that um but yeah you're supposed to say
2317880	2321960	your accolades what you want to achieve within the agency is a good thing
2321960	2327080	to mention um you're also supposed to pass the
2327160	2331480	test where you say hi vealer at the start because that means you read the
2331480	2336200	instructions properly if you didn't start with hi vealer
2336200	2341240	um i didn't close your application right away i gave you a chance but it's kind
2341240	2347400	of one of those tests where those who did it i know you read
2347400	2353960	those who didn't either you forgot although i say that i mean the girls
2353960	2358120	have given me permission to kind of talk about that the thing
2358120	2361960	azura's application was unprofessional
2361960	2365800	fuck i'm not even going to be around the bush with azura
2365800	2371640	she gave me permission to talk about it in her intro like her introduction
2371640	2376920	she's like hey i'm azura and she was like i really don't like pickles
2376920	2381160	and i don't like mustard and i was i'm like azura this is your
2381160	2385080	introduction video you're supposed to like tell me things you've achieved
2385080	2388280	she's like yeah i don't like the taste of these certain foods
2388280	2392200	and i was like you're perfect for the hag and you come
2392200	2398040	like you're perfect for the doting hag that we've got like no competition
2398040	2405800	um uh i say doesn't even english isn't even her first language
2405800	2412440	she had the most professional uh application she had these
2412440	2420040	massive paragraphs serious answers uh immi was a dafty she
2420040	2423880	freaking forgot to edit one part of her application
2423880	2429400	and in one of the answers she was like i want to diddle the other girls and i'm
2429400	2433240	like i knew it was an oversight because everything else was professional i'm
2433240	2438280	like any one earth have you put um
2438280	2444280	she be she failed the high vealour
2444280	2450280	mercy um must have watched her introduction video like
2450280	2455640	30 times over she was so like she went above and beyond
2455640	2461080	she actually created icy um like recreated her outline and named her and all
2461080	2466680	that pocha emmi left that on purpose
2466680	2472200	yeah um the introduction video gives me a very
2472200	2474920	good hint to what kind of each of her you are
2474920	2479160	no what kind of person you are because there's one thing to stream
2479160	2482840	but when you're talking directly to someone who's assessing you
2482840	2490120	you act a bit different um and yes it was very interesting
2490120	2493480	i got serenaded so much so i don't know why i'm
2493480	2497560	frol blinking and let me just give me one second
2497560	2502600	we're totally not recalibrating the old mech hold on
2506920	2511480	that's better calibration um
2511480	2515240	yeah i got serenaded so many people were singing i'm like you don't have to sing
2515240	2519480	to be in this agency you just need a one cover song that's it
2519480	2524200	i'm not gonna force you to sing um
2524200	2527560	probably
2528360	2534360	one of the most frustrating things was we asked to have streaming history
2534360	2538840	and people's evidence of like being a streamer was like a link to their twitter
2538840	2541720	and no other thing oh no content creator that was the
2541720	2546040	terminology used you had to be a content creator and it was like
2546040	2549800	are you okay why are you linking your twitter twitter isn't content
2549800	2553560	there weren't even a v-tweet or anything like that and it was just like
2553560	2557400	rub are the girls doing more songs yes
2557400	2560200	100% uh if the girls want to pursue more singing they just
2560200	2566760	come and me tell me what they want to do uh and i get that she don't
2566760	2573960	uh well other things obviously i'm not gonna say anything private um
2573960	2577880	i'm very flattered there were some very big names that applied
2577880	2581880	but they just weren't a good fit or they already had a pre-established brand and
2581880	2585000	it was like is this really what you want
2585000	2589560	i think you just wanted i think some people that were very
2589560	2594760	notoriet had high notoriety were interested more in the manager side
2594760	2601480	of things than actually being that velar we had like one person was
2601480	2607800	freaking massive and they were like can i keep my ip and join you and i'm like
2607800	2613960	sorry i need to own the rights to the models in order to do what we need to
2613960	2620200	okay it was a shame because i'm sure that person would have done just fine but
2620200	2629000	yeah it was it's not possible to not have the ip and utilize the gills
2629640	2635880	yes it was in the facts on the page um yeah the website got so many
2635880	2639080	fucking questions that were answered on the website
2639080	2644120	so they had to ignore the tab that had all the information
2644120	2648600	to go to the contact part of the website
2648600	2655080	to then ask the question that was already on the website
2655080	2661080	um literally i tried so hard to make that shit be as
2661080	2664440	comprehensible as possible
2664440	2667240	um
2667240	2673160	yes i think the applicants definitely read through it all
2673160	2675400	uh
2675400	2679240	brief time oh i can't see that sorry sorry i'm not uh that's the quote it's a
2679240	2683240	code name code name i did not say that word please don't get on me
2683240	2686520	um
2686600	2692120	um i'm just trying to think back if there's anything notable on the
2692120	2698120	applications oh my god there was one application
2698120	2706680	she was outrageous outrageous if you apply to an agency that agency
2706680	2711080	watches your content this girl my goodness
2711080	2716600	she applied i went on her twitter her twitch to listen to her live to check
2716600	2722520	her out and all that she admitted in the next
2722520	2726840	live stream oh i'd only do via lure for one year and then
2726840	2731240	bring the my audience over to this account
2731240	2737240	why would you admit that i'm very happy to say i never even considered her
2737240	2743480	but oh my god how could you be so like i don't even know what the word is
2743480	2747800	i was gobsmacked like i sent it to other members of the team
2747800	2751560	to make sure i heard what i heard was correct
2751560	2756760	but they outright said yeah i would just do it for one year and then bring my
2756760	2759720	audience over
2761640	2765800	dog thank god i didn't waste
2765800	2772600	waste a slot for you i'm very happy to say that all current talents

2782600	2785640	patreon or monetization streams when the girls get
2785640	2789880	monetized uh but yes i was absolutely gobsmacked
2789880	2794600	one to even apply to do it in the first place knowing you have no commitment
2795080	2798920	knowing that we're like 80-20 split everything's in your favor 100%
2798920	2803240	merch and saying that like you're not even gonna be
2803240	2810760	like dedicated oh my god and then to admit it to admit it knowing you
2810760	2814840	submit yourself and the agency is watching over you
2814840	2821400	oh my god absolutely gobsmacked

2828440	2832600	happy to say that all girls have given me indications of long term
2832600	2838520	commitment uh if you will and as well as uh if they sign on for one more
2838520	2842440	year like another year uh the split goes 15
2842440	2848840	85 85 to them 15 to the agency and they also get an alternative outfit on us
2848840	2852200	they do not pay for it we pay for it
2852200	2855240	i'm glad she was honest i didn't waste her time no
2855240	2860040	she was honest in her stream she was not honest on her application form to

2943240	2947720	an alternative website at a later date please understand we are trying to
2947720	2952120	establish yourself on youtube at first and we have monetization on youtube and
2952120	2957320	the girls income is all sorted but yes there are plans i will make it free
2957320	2961960	access um
2962520	2966440	i do not believe in charging any further than
2966440	2971880	um youtube membership and patreon so all together is
2971880	2975800	999 for your oh shi desu to support because it
2975800	2982200	is it is 199 for emotes to make sure no one gets gifted membership
2982200	2986440	and then is it 499 or is it 399
2987400	2989720	my voice is
2990600	2996040	is it 4999 for membership usually
2996040	3001640	is 499 yeah 4999 seen agreeable okay 199 for tier 1 499 yeah that sounds
3001640	3005560	right that sounds right um as long as you guys don't think it's outrageous
3005560	3009480	like in the state each um as i've said in the vealer
3009480	3013480	smoothstream we are undercutting the market
3013480	3018920	um i'm not even going to pretend otherwise uh on the vea side of things
3018920	3022840	most vea's start at $10 for two exclusive audios
3022840	3026600	we are undercutting the market by doing four audios for $5
3026600	3030680	and no price increase at all is planned and if you
3030680	3033640	fell ever so inclined you can donate more via
3033640	3038280	donate you can support more via patreon there is a secondary
3038280	3046040	tier that uh it's $20 i believe um i haven't put anything else
3046040	3053160	um yes what's your history with hypnosis i'm learning i'm a new baby
3053160	3057400	um but i'm going to give it my best shot i have a very
3057400	3061720	uh deep interest in it i've just never actually made content about it like
3061720	3067160	straight up uh it's not expensive yes i
3074360	3078440	oh i really i've heard some stories around that it was going to be
3078440	3083800	five for standard and 20 oh no no we're undercutting the market five
3083800	3088760	dollars and you get four four audios per month
3088760	3093400	um are you concerned undercutting could cause a scene
3093400	3097480	wide price shift downwards uh no because prices are going up
3097480	3105000	everywhere um following the voice actress trends
3105000	3108760	um on the ASMR side of things and the the roleplay side of things
3108760	3113080	prices are only going up uh and i believe in the opposite i believe in
3113080	3117400	delivering both quality and quantity um without
3117400	3120680	overworking the girls please understand that management uh have
3120680	3126120	dictated the scripts for a couple of months however
3126120	3129960	um there's few girls interested in writing their scripts i'm also very
3129960	3133480	open to writing scripts live unfortunately will be a membership
3133480	3137320	stream uh for me content wise to give you guys exactly
3137320	3141000	what you're looking for um but please understand i cannot pigeon
3141000	3145240	hold the girls into doing the same thing over and over again
3145240	3149960	just rehashed that's not that's not um
3149960	3153560	that is no way for them to be set up for success that is
3153560	3158680	they will be set up for failure sadly if i did that and i really hope
3158680	3163560	yeah have you written any scripts yet yeah you listen to them
3163560	3166920	everything you look that's out right now on patreon is done by me
3166920	3173160	the two other script writers kicking i want to say roughly in three months
3173160	3179400	and then the manager for the scripts is about to kick in
3179400	3184840	i don't know quite what's happening yet if they'll write the majority
3184840	3189000	um this is just my humble opinion but because
3189000	3195720	i don't have my scripts do not come out as best
3195720	3201480	as if a man had written it that's just my opinion
3201480	3207320	um the emi has shown interest in a script shibi has shown interest in
3207320	3211640	writing i think azura prefers the help
3211640	3219160	azura um i think she needs reassurance ac
3219160	3224200	ac is good at improv i think she may do some improv scripts in the
3224200	3228920	future uh yeah
3229080	3237080	what is the adult aspect to the agency uh the alternate alt twitters and uh
3237080	3244840	patreon yeah azura did you just did
3245560	3250600	i eventually want to be a member for the girls you girls they're they're fine
3250600	3255160	uh yeah i'll kind of repeat this if you like are in a position where you can
3255160	3259720	support like a like one girl please think about supporting
3259720	3266200	the other girls over me um i am living a very good life um
3266200	3271720	and things are going very well please don't worry about me okay
3271720	3275640	how do you find the alternate of twitters
3276360	3282920	check who they're following yeah check it check who they're following
3282920	3286040	question about your design how did you come up with the twin tails and the
3286040	3291080	candy pee is seashells i'm a cuttlefish i'm i'm a cbtuber
3291080	3296200	uh these are cuttlefish uh sorry these are seashells
3296200	3302360	uh and then i got double bunches um i love symmetrical hair and i love bunches
3302360	3305320	so i've got double bunches
3305800	3313800	um would you be open to accepting script submissions
3313800	3317560	absolutely i don't know how to set it up i don't know how to do it and i don't
3317560	3323240	know i need i would need to like give a guide because
3323240	3331720	it's quite hard to get it all efficient and good to go
3331800	3336440	definitely open to it please do let us cook though like literally the dust is
3336440	3339800	settling the girls are about to start doing game streams after these two
3339800	3345800	point ohs um the first week i did request the girls to
3345800	3350120	stream as much as they're physically able to without cancelling streams i have
3350120	3354200	emphasised to them that cancelling streams
3354200	3357880	try your best to not over promise it's better to
3357880	3364920	take a day off than it is to um plan a stream that you think you can do and
3364920	3370760	then you get too tired and cancel it because cancelling streams is very
3370760	3374440	people plan people plan their time and their days and their energy
3374440	3377720	around a stream if they know what time it's coming on and it's very valuable
3377720	3383640	to respect people's time so like for reeflands for example you guys know
3383640	3389880	that i don't stop streaming like at all and i'm always there and i literally
3389880	3394600	have never cancelled the stream so and that's true i haven't cancelled the
3394600	3397000	stream
3398840	3403400	um sorry to tell you just to bring the topic back gifted membership is the one
3403400	3408280	that's closest to five dollars yeah you may have to go higher
3408840	3414200	eh it's all i thought gifted membership went to the lowest tier tier one was
3414200	3419640	going to be emotes only and then tier two is going to be four ninety nine
3419640	3425720	i really don't want to overcharge so there is gonna
3430360	3433880	well wait more streams uh yeah i stream all day every eight
3433880	3441000	maybe just make it an extra dollar it's expensive though
3441640	3446920	who goes there by the pope identify yourself
3447480	3452840	um how do you prevent any mischief from the talents
3452840	3456200	uh i know they're responsible adults but from a legal span
3456200	3460360	standpoint how do you prevent any possible uh repercussions of the
3460360	3463640	talents actions does the company not take responsibility
3463640	3470040	or do they do create freedom um i literally said in the interview you're
3470040	3473480	not going to get in trouble i'm not your mum i couldn't give less of two shits
3473480	3477400	what you do um i basically said the only thing i
3477400	3483800	ask you not to do is release any nda content and um
3483800	3487560	you know don't say the n word you know basic adult
3487560	3492920	stuff it's pretty much it i mean i don't know what else to tell you
3492920	3496040	when you treat adults like adults they act like adults
3496040	3498520	it's crazy
3502360	3507640	did you hypnotize the girls to become the characters
3507640	3512200	eh i hope you're drinking a lot soda i'm i'm going cola it's fizzy juice
3512200	3515960	actually sorry you're turning scots it's not cold it's not uh
3515960	3521640	soda it's fizzy juice um yes
3523080	3526200	um as for repercussions like as i said we don't do
3526200	3530600	um suspensions however i did warn them i said
3530600	3536200	does it mean you're allowed free reign like we can cut we can terminate

3539880	3543640	of that shit thank god yeah i have full faith in these

3887560	3894920	um me me on reflex oh my god i need to make a reflex post
3894920	3899480	on my alternate and my voice is so loud
3899480	3903560	mummy thank you for giving me a little sister you talked prior during the
3903560	3910280	selection process about keeping a list uh a list of possible candidates so
3910280	3914600	um i got my first choice for everyone i don't know how
3914600	3917960	but everyone was like first choice pick i wanted them in the agency they came in
3917960	3925560	the agency there were i would say like eight people
3925560	3932920	that were like fall back obviously azura didn't have one that was a problem
3932920	3938360	emi i was actually really worried she wouldn't accept her lore
3939240	3942040	she likes it
3943560	3946760	i was worried that she wouldn't accept the lore
3946760	3951400	and it's like yeah that's fine i don't care i'm like okay and then jeez she's
3951400	3956920	i was worried she wouldn't accept that but that's okay um
3956920	3962040	have any japanese corpos influenced your decision making
3962040	3966600	why do you believe there was no lid one before
3966600	3973560	uh no idea probably because you need someone who's done it
3973560	3977800	before to even understand like what to do and a lot of
3977880	3982680	guy owned corporations like in the nicest way most likely haven't been
3982680	3986680	streamers before and don't comprehend what you're asking people to do
3986680	3989800	like uh i kind of spoke about this a wee bit in the last
3989800	3995400	stream like that 80 20 split in order to motivate people you have to let them
3995400	3999000	earn what they're worth if you turn around and say to them
3999000	4003720	for every 100 dollars uh you're getting you know 20 bucks out of it you're
4003720	4008520	getting 50 bucks out of it like all that girl is going to be doing is
4008520	4012280	sitting there saying oh wow i could have made the full
4012280	4015480	hundred on my alt account oh wow i could have done this on my previous
4015480	4018280	life like that's all that they're going to sit there and think
4018280	4023880	okay like i'm we talking pure business baby i'm happy to talk pure
4023880	4028680	business if you want um
4028680	4032120	well the monthly audio releases be revealed before the month starts yes
4032120	4039080	and we need to get on top of that sadly there was a few issues
4039080	4042760	production wise with a few things i'm so surprised
4042760	4045960	turns out uh takes a lot of time to make these things happen
4045960	4051960	love artists but my fucking god can you not go over deadlines that'd be great
4051960	4059640	um but yes we will be posting monthly like what the tags are what the title
4059640	4064520	is um we just need to catch up like you need to give us time to breathe i'm
4064520	4067000	so sorry all i can ask is your patience and
4067000	4072600	unironically like bow emoji because uh we need time like it was
4072600	4078120	absolutely hectic on debut we were exhausted in that group
4078120	4082360	collab and like like i don't know if you
4082360	4088280	recognized like how fast we ended i was like right say bye to chat bye like
4088280	4091880	we all disappeared out that voice call so quickly i was like thank you guys so
4091880	4097480	much i'm gonna wait to pass out and then i ended up being really sick after it
4097480	4101000	um but yes we just need things to calm down
4101000	4103960	we're we're gonna ease into the first week everyone's got their games you get
4103960	4109400	to see their personalities more enjoy them more which is fantastic
4109400	4116840	um octopus i'm not an octopus i'm a codonfish
4116840	4124680	no call me octopus no call me squid i'm a cephalopod or a kurofish
4124680	4128680	better take your yourselves and now the things have calmed down like
4128680	4135240	the lead-up to debut is very nerve-racking like very very nerve-racking
4135240	4138600	i have finished my kola i will never start on
4138600	4143400	fame my warble
4144760	4149800	oh i strongly you're super good
4149800	4155400	hey you like my teeth is that what's doing it for you
4155400	4160040	um but i think i've called for for the question
4160040	4164760	oh no i lied is there a reason you went with youtube over
4164760	4168680	twitch yes i can manage the girls accounts from youtube i cannot manage
4168680	4171640	the girls accounts from twitch can't do a thing on twitch
4171640	4178920	management-wise um and twitch uh unfortunately are very sparse and
4178920	4183320	arbitrary when they uh throw the old band hammer down or
4183320	4187640	suspension hammer down uh really not a fan of twitch doing that
4187640	4191560	it's every week you see a girl being like twitch with a heck
4191560	4195240	i'm literally doing everything that everyone i'm doing stuff that everyone
4195240	4201240	else does um like it just at least with youtube you
4201240	4205320	can like beg them on twitter for help or whatever
4205320	4209560	and twitch is inconsistent yeah let's see
4209560	4213880	uh would you dominate inkling
4213880	4217960	i've never played splatoon isn't actually good it's probably like the most
4217960	4222040	war-friendly game for me to play
4222040	4225160	um
4225160	4228920	how does managing account yeah so i have it sounds really bad but i don't do
4228920	4232680	anything on their accounts but um i can basically go on their
4232680	4238120	accounts and set up streams for them or approve of comments for them
4238120	4242840	um anything they want to help out really like um now that
4242840	4247000	debuts have happened the girls are like gonna be controlling all that stuff
4247000	4250600	like they'll be doing their live streams and stuff but in order to reduce
4250600	4255160	as much stress as possible and the girls i pretty much tried to do every single
4255160	4258280	little thing but now that we're past the debut
4258280	4261960	stage like they're they're gonna have to be big girls now and
4261960	4265400	you know put up their put up their little games
4265400	4269240	put up their streams and all that and update their description
4269240	4273560	like i was the one doing all that behind the scenes
4273560	4277640	um have you played pokemon yeah pokemon ruby
4277640	4283800	my childhood game um mudkip was my starter
4283800	4287080	they have to spread their big girl wings yes i like putting a message in the
4287080	4290040	discord i'm like i'm so sorry girls but the hand
4290040	4293880	holding kind of slows down now
4294040	4299160	um yeah say hello
4299160	4305160	it was torsik blaziken is so strong and so is mudkip mudkip's really strong as
4305160	4309880	well um mudkip's always used in speed runs for pokemon
4309880	4313720	ruby or emerald she doesn't know i want to collect
4313720	4318920	her ink oh my god inks on you strongy is mama bird but it's time for them to
4318920	4323800	flee the nest honestly like um i hope overall they
4323800	4329480	feel like less stressed like um they didn't have to think about the
4329480	4333000	lores or what they wanted to say everything was edited on their behalf
4333000	4336360	like they had to give the audios over but everything was done on their behalf
4336360	4343240	and because like i've heard stories of like other agencies like go to the
4343240	4346520	tablet right make up your lore we've ordered all the art but you make up the
4346520	4350360	lore by the way and it's like what you literally are handing me the model what
4350360	4353240	do you mean you've not thought this stuff and it was like quick come up with
4353240	4356120	a description of your character really quickly quick quick
4356120	4362040	uh and it's like what you you're giving me the model what do you mean i come
4362040	4364520	up with the stuff like that's the whole point of the model unless it would be
4364520	4369400	customized like it's like um
4370520	4373560	how did you end up managing them or are you new to the agency well i'm new to
4373560	4376600	being a manager i'm not even their manager i'm just a streamer that does it
4376600	4381720	alongside them i just picked them but but me me now i want to
4382040	4386920	screen i'm fucking being a boss i ain't doing shit
4386920	4388920	um
4388920	4390920	yeah
4392120	4398280	um i know this isn't it someone said it someone said say purple burglar alarm
4398280	4401560	got it i knew someone was gonna say it i'll always guess this
4401560	4407400	right so in my like clear accent i say purple burglar alarm but if i say it
4407400	4411560	in a harsh scottish accent purple burglar alarm
4411560	4415000	like my tongue gets caught on the top of the roof of my mouth wait i'll mute
4415000	4419880	my background music so you can really hear it my my tongue gets caught
4419880	4426040	purple burglar alarm like ooh purple burglar alarm
4426040	4432440	you can hear my tongue getting caught say that
4438360	4441480	uh
4443480	4447720	what did you miss nothing it's just me meamin about
4447720	4450920	are you all trying to keep non conflicting schedules sadly it's not
4450920	4453800	possible when someone like me is on the team
4453800	4459320	um so whenever uh gen mate of mine goes live i will highly recommend you go
4459320	4462200	watch them because right now for example she'd be caught in bum is live
4462200	4467400	dinner 2.0 uh azura is coming on in roughly three hours
4467400	4472360	um but sadly i am an endurance streamer and the best time slot that i have
4472360	4476280	selected means i can go to doctor's appointments even if i do
4476280	4479800	um no i'm not dying before anyone freaking types that
4479800	4485320	i'm fine my health is good um uh it's all good don't worry
4485320	4489720	um but the time slot i have chosen means i can still go out to do
4489720	4493320	things like go shopping or to a doctor's appointment
4493320	4497080	or um you know go feed gammy you know how it is
4497080	4501320	i'm not dying stop my health is so much better
4501320	4505080	although i do have a sad story i mean i won't say it in 2.0
4505080	4510200	even though it's just all right well no i'll keep it to myself because it's a
4510200	4512680	bit sad and i don't i don't want to make you guys sad
4512680	4515800	like this is such a good happy time like holy fuck we're back
4515800	4518760	um after a year god damn that took so long to cook
4518760	4524840	but we're strongy cut with me that's just my name
4524840	4531320	admit it that's just my name um but yeah sadly i am an endurance
4531320	4535720	streamer which means weekly i will most likely have very long streams that are
4535720	4541960	not friendly to the majority of viewers please understand do not feel bad
4541960	4546040	um if you are unable to watch me live
4546040	4551880	um the other girls uh might be much more accessible to you time zone wise or
4551880	4556680	stream wise um i can still hear her
4556680	4560440	um but i play i absolutely do not feel insulted
4560440	4566600	at all if you cannot um you know keep up with me i'm not very friendly my
4566600	4569800	time zone isn't friendly i am aware of that and because i'm an
4569800	4572680	endurance streamer like tomorrow's stream is
4572680	4575960	literally eight hours long i'm not even kidding
4575960	4579320	we're doing the full playthrough of assassin's creed brotherhood
4579320	4583080	and then we're going back to 100% it because i've never 100%
4583080	4586440	in the dna sequence since assassin's creed brotherhood before
4586440	4590040	like that's what we're doing the next day what do you mean
4590040	4594680	i thought you just debuted
4595400	4602920	um so yeah that's uh why um whenever a gen mate goes live please you are more
4602920	4607000	than welcome to tell me i will direct you guys to the gen mate because i can't
4607000	4610600	redirect because my stream my gate if my stream isn't over
4610600	4615480	um so full point through first day is planned yes and then 100%
4615480	4618840	the next day i don't know how long it's gonna take but yeah
4618840	4623720	um eight hours isn't going to be the norm every single stream so like for
4623720	4627160	example oh for example
4627160	4633240	uh um for example needy streamer overload
4633240	4639160	um is two hours long i think i've never played the game before
4639160	4643400	i think it's just a click simulator type thing i'm not sure
4643400	4648840	um i've also got uh however actually um
4648840	4652680	james cameron's avatars an eight hour stream
4652680	4659400	sorry uh old school runescape is like 12 hours oh god
4659400	4663960	these are all so long like i've got to i need to make up for lost time
4663960	4671000	okay i need make up for lost time um not to mention uh once i get membership
4671000	4674440	once i get monetized i'm also doing membership streams
4674440	4680600	on top of all of this um it's a more stream on saturday um
4680600	4683880	and then i'm trying foreign sweets it is gonna be
4683880	4691240	like a uh hand like a desk cam oh yeah oh you get to see my desk man
4691240	4698760	um when do you rest i will rest until i'm dead i've waited a year to be here
4698760	4704360	i have lost time to make up for um people have waited in cryo freeze for me
4704360	4709240	for a very long time and the way i say thank you is
4709240	4713080	rather than saying thank you is like doing it through content through ASMR
4713080	4719000	through collabs through everything so yeah
4719000	4724600	i'm making up for it oh no uh someone says don't burn out please
4724600	4728360	i have a secret for you i have this thing your honor
4728360	4735400	it's called rotism and it means i actually don't experience burnout
4735400	4739640	i don't experience it i basically go to sleep
4739640	4743320	and wake up the next day i'm ready to take on the world again
4743320	4748280	uh i've never really felt what burnout is the way people describe it
4748280	4754760	nope nope i think uh my autism has given me a buff um
4754760	4759960	and means i don't get burnout and i'm very excited to stream every single day

5202920	5208200	e what do you think of sunken gallery
5208760	5214200	i'm not convinced
5214200	5219720	such probation i know i know i know i know was that the melody of legend of
5219720	5232200	zelda
5232520	5237560	um will you get multiple endings there's multiple endings
5237560	5240920	i've never played i actually don't know much about the game i thought it was
5240920	5245000	like you click buttons that's all i know
5245000	5248200	that you click buttons you'll never get i'm really good at
5248200	5252840	clicking buttons you know what i'm saying they're all bad endings
5252840	5256760	oh no there's tons of endings i thought it was like one of them
5256760	5261400	quick games
5262200	5265960	how did you end up getting to pick the talents
5265960	5269960	when you're just new to the agency zelda
5269960	5273560	because i'm the creative director
5275320	5278600	i'm the creative director
5279480	5282760	good ending is when you get your mask no
5282760	5286760	oh okay maybe take your mask
5289880	5294200	and the voices go away no don't take your mask i don't want to play elton ring
5294200	5298120	and then take my mask because then you guys all disappear
5298120	5301400	oh my god do you remember that time we played elton ring
5301400	5305320	and we all like we're mimicking something
5305320	5309880	and then someone came in and went banzai and blew it all up
5309880	5313960	that was amazing how big is the viewer game
5313960	5317960	i mean it depends if you want to count contractors as well
5317960	5321560	i guess it's pretty juicy if you want to count contractors
5321560	5325640	like we've literally got like four more technical clippers coming in
5325640	5329560	no one person's about to be on trial
5329560	5333560	two are like we want them full-time basically
5334280	5338440	so that adds more people to the website
5338440	5341640	do you count the talents as well that's another six then
5341640	5345800	technically if we disappear who will stream site
5345800	5348440	oh yeah one of you guys have to come in as the baddie
5348440	5351480	wait what's happening with my arm
5351480	5354280	what's happening with my arm
5354280	5358680	oh no i'm gonna have to know you about that
5358680	5362440	it's a bit too aggressive
5362600	5366760	are there any big group projects yes oh my god
5366760	5370680	there's such big group projects i'm so tired
5370680	5373720	i planned ahead i planned every month there's going to be
5373720	5378040	some sort of event going on at the allure
5378040	5384040	um leave my noodle arm i don't know why my arm breaking
5384040	5387400	i'll annoying nari about it nari was absolutely fantastic when she came to
5387400	5392040	construct in me she's fantastic um you plan on getting 3d models yes but
5392040	5394040	you're gonna have to put your money where your mouth is if you want to see the
5394040	5395960	girls 3d put your money where your mouth is give them
5395960	5399240	memberships uh go on them patrons because
5399240	5404520	that's expensive expensive because uh we would have to buy them the trackers as
5404520	5407800	well i actually don't know much about 3d in yet but i'm
5407800	5412440	pretty sure like you can be our chat model and we can all like
5412440	5415640	touch each other and stuff in there
5416280	5422440	uh will there be group audios yes there will be group
5422440	5426520	audios um there's already one-on-one audios planned
5426520	5431400	with each other but i didn't know the comfortability level of the girls when
5431400	5435880	we were like at that stage of development so so far
5435880	5441640	is hasura and sheepsters me and mersey and emmers and
5441640	5445240	icers um i've not done anything further i think
5445240	5450200	donathan rewards uh will most likely be targeted at that stuff and it'll be
5450200	5455720	access free to access um because i think public
5455720	5459960	donathan rewards are much more satisfactory obviously we will have to
5459960	5464040	do the classic uh like first place second place third
5464040	5469000	place um because we do need to incentivize and um
5469000	5474440	azura um uh might be in the position to move out if all
5474440	5480280	goes well and she gets the support um like monetary like gets monetized and
5480280	5483000	all that jazz and if she can move out she can definitely increase her like
5483000	5486840	stream times for years and uh just find a easier
5486840	5489640	time uh that's why i'm kind of like support the others
5489640	5492360	because like they're in positions where like oh if i could move out i could
5492360	5495400	definitely make more content stream for longer do this do that be more like
5495400	5499720	you know so definitely support them okay
5499720	5504280	can i drill it in your head anymore to support them or
5504280	5507720	then you like hypnotize you
5509960	5513720	oh my picture's on twitter right okay i'll get that i'll update it
5513720	5516200	and
5516920	5521000	mm-hmm
5521320	5526440	oh no we did not have a vealer house a vealer house would be awesome actually
5526440	5532200	uh no the girls are like some of them are like still living with family or
5532200	5536760	and so they can't really be like oh like you know
5536760	5541160	all the time so yeah
5541720	5546200	we obey we support the girls but you kindly support the girl
5546200	5549080	so yeah um
5550520	5556920	that is why um so uh azure's up first for donathan rewards to kind of give you an
5556920	5562040	idea um i'm opening to you know farting about
5562040	5566440	and uh being open to like kind of the stuff you guys would like to see
5566440	5570280	perfectly fine with me no problem
5571000	5573960	um
5574040	5580120	are the audios on patreon already done do you mean like edit
5580120	5586440	um only one month it's been done so like june is done so the girl's
5586440	5590120	responsibilities like contract wise is three streams a week
5590120	5594920	if health permitted oh my god if health permitted i got asked by one of the
5594920	5599480	girls i just azure was like did i need to give you a
5599480	5605160	doctor's note if i'm sick i'm like no go rest my goodness
5605160	5610840	you're not well you're not well um so if they're in good health they are to
5610840	5615000	stream a minimum of three times a week and monthly four audios
5615000	5618280	that's it i definitely do not want to overwork
5618280	5621720	anyone i do not want them to feel stressed i want them to have good times
5621720	5629800	good vibes uh happy ending uh yeah and they've been like super
5629800	5634760	patient and like the behind the scenes stuff going on
5634760	5640440	uh do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
5640440	5644360	do you talk often with one each other yeah we're in a we're in a discord we talk
5644360	5648040	every day for two months we've like literally
5648040	5652920	talked every day um you know some some girls like might
5652920	5656760	feel like awkward around each other uh we had like a couple of gaming sessions
5656760	5659560	leading up to that uh we had mock streams together
5659560	5662920	i like wholeheartedly feel a hundred percent comfortable around these girls
5662920	5667480	um like when it comes to collabing with other vtubers outside the agency
5667480	5672840	unfortunately for me personally i'm quite inappropriate and if i don't know the
5672840	5677000	person and i don't know their comfort level i'm not really interested in like
5677000	5680600	asking for like uh oh you want to do a vtuber club type thing
5680600	5685240	um so uh i'm probably not going to do too many
5685240	5688600	clubs out with the agency unless like the girls vouch for me
5688600	5692440	or something like i'm i'm happy to make friends with their friends
5692440	5696440	but um it's probably going to be solo content majority on
5696440	5700520	this channel uh such as content featuring the reeflings when we
5700520	5707240	play our multiplayer games um yeah i
5707400	5712920	um there is a notification discord if you go on the others twitter
5712920	5716840	uh it's notification only uh the talents are not inside it
5716840	5724920	uh the talents uh sorry my voice is like proper feeling it right now
5724920	5728760	um yeah management don't have access
5728760	5732280	uh sorry contractors don't have access to the talent
5732280	5736280	talents aren't in the notification discord there's no way you can groom
5736280	5740440	us we groom you
5740520	5750680	why am i freaking frog blanking it's me it's probably not set up my parameters
5753480	5757240	one thing get more stable with the group discord for
5757240	5761160	watchers to be joined on the table what are you saying
5761160	5764840	i have no idea what you just said to me
5764840	5768040	will you hang out say together outside of the collapse
5768040	5772360	i don't even know if we're gonna have time like collabs are probably just

6584440	6590600	i have to go in if there's any issues um i i can play horror games
6590600	6594680	it's just ill advised i would probably do it as like a
6594680	6599800	reward uh without giving the game away oh i don't want
6599800	6604360	a game i'm playing next week are you guys ready
6604360	6609480	i'm playing skyrim fill achievements next week
6609480	6612440	because i know how to get full achievements in that game because i've
6612440	6615800	done it a few times before
6615960	6621080	um and obviously uh skyrim belongs to the north thank you very much
6621080	6627640	i'll be here all week storm cloaks yep don't care what they say
6628440	6632200	you know i'm all for talus praise be to talus
6632200	6636040	um
6636040	6639720	so that's my duration game for next week is skyrim first
6639720	6645080	i believe it takes me just over 24 hours to do full achievements
6645080	6649880	um we kind of you kind of cheat at the start because you do if you do the
6649880	6653400	companions questline first and then go back to the save
6653400	6658360	before so you're not a werewolf and then do the vampire quest
6658360	6665880	the problem i don't know if it's gonna be a problem if i use
6665880	6673640	um xbox pass for it because because um my xbox would break
6673640	6678840	so many times trying to play skyrim because the save file issues
6678840	6686120	um and i i if it's going to be the same way then
6686120	6689960	there's a strategical way to get full achievements via the xbox i already
6689960	6693240	know how to do it i've done it a few times so don't worry i'll lay it all out
6693240	6695880	for you baby i'll show you how to get full achievements in skyrim
6695880	6700040	in under 24 hours that'll be my challenge in under 24 hours
6700040	6704120	i'm sure you can do it under way less but i i don't know the strength i'm not a
6704120	6707000	speedrunner
6709000	6713800	he is i had a girl ghost me because i told her you picked the stormcloth
6713800	6718440	what why would anyone pick the legion sorry but the elves can perish you're
6718440	6722200	no coming into my home country being like no you're not allowed to
6722200	6726360	praise talos uh excuse me you can get
6726360	6734040	people a bit of casual fantasy or racism don't mind me
6734040	6737640	absolutely i'm stormcloth all the way don't care
6737640	6744840	don't care don't care i know i'm right
6744840	6747240	um
6748440	6754040	being team instinct in pokemon go
6754040	6757880	because if you always follow your instincts you'll get there in the end

6762280	6766600	pokemon go but i'm team instinct and then the moment was like if you always
6766600	6769880	if you follow your instincts you'll always win because it doesn't mean you
6769880	6773400	have to win or lose just follow how you feel
6773400	6776440	and life is good
6777400	6781800	because team mystic is for like wise people and then team red i've forgotten
