0	9800	Testing, testing. Attention, please. Attention, attention. Hear you, hear you.
9800	17040	Skyrim belongs to the North. That's my hear you, hear you. Why are you saying I
17040	22840	hate you? I'm not even freaking spawning yet! Let me spawn in! You know, I learned
22840	28000	something new yesterday thanks to TikTok so I can't wait to talk about it.
28000	39320	Right, testing. This is Ambroker. See, this freaking, you freaking freaks. Oh my
39320	47320	god! Oh my god! I'm YouTube, I got accepted from YouTube monetization like
47320	53120	right now! No way! I just got accepted for YouTube monetization right freaking
53120	61760	now! No way! Wait, but I need to do my stream then! Wait! Oh my god! I literally
61760	69920	just opened up YouTube studio! I've been accepted! No way! Wait, do I need to go off
69920	79200	lane and do my... No, I'll do it tomorrow. Oh my god! We did it! What the frick? What's
79200	85080	the frick? Fractally tech? Tic-tac? Petty work? Oh my god! Wait, and hopefully this
85080	92360	doesn't say anything. Wow! Wow! I just freaking checked! Right, right. We're still
92360	97080	gonna do Skyrim today because you know, Skyrim belongs to the Norths. But what? Tomorrow I'll
97080	102760	get to do my monetization celebration stream! And my toes look amazing for it so I'm
102760	109320	excited! Oh my god! That's amazing! Right, if you're freaking watching right now,
109320	114440	don't worry. Like the how you call it. The memberships aren't like activated
114440	118240	because I need to like go in and tell it like what to call the tiers and stuff.
118240	126240	But I'm like 100% sure tier one is $1.99 USD. This is to prevent anyone
126240	131720	gaining access via gift to membership streams. And then I believe the the
131760	142760	membership price, like the actual price, is $4.99 USD. Does that sound right? I need to ask you guys!
142760	151080	I need to ask you guys what sounds right. You guys call the shots. Yeah, if it's $4.99
151080	156840	and then Patreon's $5 then it's $9.99 total to support your Oshii at Veiler.
157320	161720	You okay? That seems right. Okay, that sounds okay. Everyone's gonna give me the thumbs up.
161720	163320	Ahhhh!
163320	168680	Congrats on the monetization. Doesn't mean we won't support you in other ways anymore though.
168680	172000	Oh, thank you so much. I really miss you.
172000	173000	WAH!
173000	176000	Congrats. I'm happy for you.
176000	182600	Why are you giving me money for getting more money? What the fuck? It's an infinite money glitch.
183240	191800	Oh my god. Also, there was an offline donation by Shank. Shank says, thank you for the tip,
191800	195960	by the way, he says, I'm over here squiddin' my dick. I got ink on my dick right now.
196520	202920	Which is so good. Thank you, Tim Schottel. Congrats on the monetization. Thank you!
202920	208920	And Bajinga as well. Thank you again for the tip. For the 20. That was a big tip. Thank you.
209240	217000	Okay. To prevent gifts, you need to set the membership quote above five bucks. Are you serious?
218120	222120	Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wasn't it not membership can only be gifted?
222120	222760	Stop giving me!
223720	225320	He's confusing the couple things.
225320	230600	Then why are you giving me money for being able to make, oh my god, no! I have to end up
230600	235960	my ASMR series now. I have four ASMR videos. I owe you.
236680	242840	Oh, and I'm doing an endurance stream today. It's over. Reluctantly saying thank you for the tip.
243960	251000	Wait, I could have sworn you can only gift the lowest tier membership on YouTube,
251000	256120	or has that been updated since? I won't say who so they can announce it themselves,
256120	261560	but someone else has also gotten monetized. Oh my god, we're all done or monetized?
261560	267400	No way. Like, okay. So the only reason we didn't like get monetized faster in quotation marks
267400	270680	is because you, stop it! Don't give me money! Forget money!
272840	278680	Pre-ordering my search. Thank you. Don't stay down for the tip. That's crazy.
279960	285480	That's freaking crazy. Gifts go to the most expensive tier under five bucks.
285480	290280	So I need to set it as 501. That looks terrible though. That looks so greedy.
291640	295640	But I can't have any outsiders in the membership streams because
295640	300040	I need to use a lot of euphemisms. Are you squiddling right now?
300040	304680	Shank! Oh, it's off-link! I'm in front of the Blackwater. I'm all about stron of the bath.
306040	311960	Thanks, Shank, for the tip. You guys will get the Blackwater reference very shortly. Super training,
312520	320840	Virginia! Stop! Actually, one cent greed law. Actually, it's two cent greed because I wanted it
320840	327800	4.99. It's said it to... No, six dollars is too much. This is too much money to ask for,
327800	336280	like, for membership stuff. Oh, right, that's it. When I said we're making an agency together,
336920	342840	I wasn't kidding. Oh, I see. And our snowberries are here. They just did an ASMR stream. We all
342840	350520	have to keep our voices down, okay? The snowberries are asleep. Fine, you've got it. Set it to 999.
350520	354600	I would start at 60 bucks just to be sure. Post up, are you?
356280	363400	And hi, Icy Raiders. Hi, snowberries. I just unlocked monetization. I didn't know
363480	369320	until I freaking went on my channel. It just happened right now. I'm not going to do my monetization
369320	374680	celebration today. I'm going to do it tomorrow and then it gives me a less time to do endurance
374680	379720	skyrim unless we come back to maybe switch up the thingy. But that's okay. It's actually a perfect
379720	389400	transition from Icy's stream. Hi, hi, little icicles. But yes, we are all getting monetized very
389400	396920	slowly, which is fantastic. Oh my gosh, you can get support via email or chat. Don't worry,
396920	404920	that chat support thing does absolutely nothing. I assure you, it doesn't do a single thing, okay?
406440	410120	Actually, I tell a lie, they did help me one time, so I'll give it up.
410120	415160	Amy, thank you, Amy, for your clap, clap, clap. Apparently, there's one other person that has
415160	420040	been processed. When we applied, it was like, yeah, it takes a month for them to review your
420040	427480	chat. A month, a month to review James Cameron's avatar, excuse me. A month to freaking review
427480	434840	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, excuse me. Oh no, I never, oh, you guys so much ASMR video.
435800	442760	But I do have some good news about VTuber Collabs. I finally, I finally
445080	452360	sent away. So now I'm waiting on the girls. The ball is now in the girls court that I'm
452360	463480	collabing with. Yeah, yesterday, I was listening to a music creator called Yoast. He's a Dutch
463560	469880	and he was in Eurovision and he goes, Welcome to Europe. Life is till the
469880	477960	daughter, Europa, Europa. Turns out he has a song where it goes, Sakma.
481240	489560	So just imagine me playing the song and repeat in the dark, taping up four ASMR collabs in one go.
490440	497320	A month review time sounds realistic, given the fact that your streams are all above 10 hours.
499480	503800	Thank you for the tip again, but you're giving a lot of money. You need to be careful with the
503800	511880	crowd. Are you just reading me right now? You're in trouble too. No, thank you for the tip. Oh my
511880	519320	God. Damn, I almost got that song out of my head. Yeah, so basically just imagine me in a dark room,
519320	528360	just I had this song on repeat. I'm like, yeah, okay, right. Wolf mums, Pamper you to sleep,
528360	533240	right? Okay, what's next? Okay, jealous VTubers drag you in an alleyway for tangos. Okay,
533240	541080	what's next? What's next? Right, next script. Like I was on it. I was on it. Anonymous. It's
541080	547160	the silent and on his back. He's giving money, but he's not saying anything. He's not getting Brian
547160	552840	to say anything. Thank you for the tip. But yeah, anyway, that's how I work. I don't know how you
552840	558200	work, but I work like a madman. Had to take a shower. So I've got to listen at 1.5 speed for
558200	565640	the next 15 minutes. I was not prepared for the super speed beat up. So I was as strongly forgotten
565640	572920	to live tweet or tweet. If you mean tweet, I have absolutely horrific news. I am the worst VTuber
572920	579880	to ever spawn. I never use my emotes. I spent like so much on all these emotes. I never use them. I
579880	583880	never tweet out when I'm live because I start at the same time every single day and I'm like,
583880	592280	you want to be here, you're gonna be here. Somebody. Absolutely. Next script. YouTube to
592280	597320	monetize you one day after you get proved. I mean, depending on how the monetization celebration
597320	602360	goes tomorrow, that's quite plausible. But hey, at least a little bit YouTube history.
603320	608520	Don't mind if I make the headlines for VLR. So you guys go and support my gen mates. That's
608520	614120	right. There are five other lovely girls in the description below for you to check out. If you
614120	622120	cannot stand, Todd winning yet again with the death grip the Skyrim has over female VTubers.
622120	627240	Okay. So if you've had enough of that, Denny, you worry, I've got you sorted out. Sheepsters
627240	632920	is going live and team minus two hours. I believe Emma and Azura, my goodness, Azura,
632920	641560	and is coming for my Endurance Stream title. For goodness gravy, she was up on a farm. No,
641560	647800	it's not called Farmville. The farming star Jew Valley, for goodness sake. And then she
647800	651880	really popped out of 10 of her Endurance Stream. I'm like, damn, they're coming from my title.
652840	656200	But I'm gonna show them how it's done. Okay, I'm gonna show them how it's done. I woke up
656200	662360	feeling sick and I was like, oh, maybe I won't do an Endurance Stream. But the moment I hit go live,
662360	668280	it feels like I have been given a second burst of energy, a second wind, if you will. It's like
668280	675480	that cinematic moment in like the video game thing. We're like, oh, Brian.
682840	691960	Why would you give 100? That's so much. You never even said anything, Dapper Bucket. Oh my
691960	701400	God. Thank you for the 100. Iron Reaper 100. Why are you? Why are you giving me money for being
701400	708440	able to earn more money? What's going on? What's going on? Have I missed something in the VTuber
708520	714680	etiquette book? Iron Reaper, thank you for the 100. Dapper, thank you for the 100. Zarian,
714680	722120	congrats on monetization. Meeting great for anyone who goes over $20 on the donut. That's
722120	727560	terrible. You can't say that part out loud. Literally, everyone is giving your... Yeah,
727560	736520	please make sure you are fully sorted before you give any money. Please understand, I adore what I
736520	743400	do. I have been welcomed with open arms into the VTuber community as someone who could definitely
743400	749800	have been described as an outsider. And instead of being shunned, I was welcomed and taught the ropes,
749800	755960	which I'm so thankful for. But please understand, like, I get streamed for free. I love what I do,
755960	764840	okay? Anonymous with a 20 with no message again. Brian, you look, you need to put Brian to work,
765400	771720	okay? You need to put Brian to work. Oh, anonymous, give me 20 because I said the 20 thing.
773800	783160	That is terrible. But we've done it. We officially have finished our first week at Bueller Headquarters.
784440	790280	Literally, everyone has done fantastic streaming. I am very happy to see some of the girls taking
790280	795880	a break. Oh, Irvan Biscay. Brian. We don't like giving YouTube a cut.
798040	802920	Wait, oh, that's why you do stream elements. Okay, I understand. I read about that. Thank you,
802920	809160	Irvan Biscay. Brian! Don't know, we'll continue until morale improves. Congratulations. Wait,
809160	816280	why did I know that? Do you guys hear Brian at all when he talks? Yeah, you do, surely you do.
816520	822120	Oh, my God. Wait, you said I said your name yesterday correctly.
822120	828680	Rilke? Rilke? Cadmus? Thank you for the tip. Why did I know that quote? Yeah, we hear him. Okay, thank
828680	836840	God. God, it feels like so much longer. You've always been here. I think because, like, my average
836840	843000	streamed week is probably what a VTuber achieves in an entire month. So it feels like I've been
843000	849400	here for a very long time. I was like, nope, this is officially my first, like, strum, you know,
849400	854920	first second week of streaming. Ancient joke, the beatings will continue until the more... Okay,
854920	866760	that's... Okay, okay, okay. Guys, do you know a perfect way to party the achievement? A really
866760	872200	big storm of bad joke. What did you even say? Was that supposed to be a joke? I don't get it.
873240	876600	I don't get the joke if that was supposed to be a joke. So you're getting crickets.
881240	885640	Who's ready? Who's ready for bi-zura, bi-zura, bi-zura. Now, I know that's not in this game,
885640	889240	but bi-zura. Remember that time I accident... Wait, can you hear the game?
892520	895640	Can you hear any of that? You can't hear any of that.
896600	902200	Oh, oh, oh, wait, get monetization off the screen right now.
903800	906600	Oh, my freaking mouse won't hover over... Right, there we go.
915160	917320	Oh, my voice is cracking already. I've known you started...
918280	926520	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Don't again, don't again. Don't again, No Skyrim.
927320	932760	I don't know the words. One of them was like all glass, for like a meme fucking cover.
936360	940600	By Pope Ryan. This is our attempt at normalizing corporate,

960920	965360	All right, I've turned it down a wee bit and turn me up
971360	974340	There's a Brian echo now
975760	980440	Right, I guess I'll just play him through desktop only. I'll just need to test if this works
981400	986120	Okay, okay, it works. It works. Okay. Let's jump into it. Do you know the actual lyrics?
986120	989640	I say dovahkin dovahkin dovahkin of Skyrim

1007880	1014240	No mods of course right no vanilla, I'm appreciating the game and its release quality
1014640	1020760	I do understand those who prefer a modded experience. I like to appreciate a game the way it has been released
1020760	1022760	I understand there's always time constraints
1022760	1027440	There's always stuff that has been taken out for example ruining the thieves guild
1028760	1030760	and
1031400	1035880	But I just I want to appreciate it how it is
1036640	1038880	Wait, I didn't hear any of that if that played

1242680	1245040	a
1245040	1250520	Grembo, thank you for the congrats and the tip. We are Nord filled. Okay, we are Nord
1250520	1254800	We are Stormcloak. We are enjoying the game as the
1255440	1262920	Resistance or the opposition to what the Legion is trying to put on the upon Skyrim as a whole
1263120	1266640	Okay, so Skyrim is the current region that we're in
1267240	1270160	There's different regions such as Hammerfell for example
1270160	1270920	Oh
1270960	1275200	Brian you rather go to the woods with a high elf or a grizzly bear
1276520	1278120	I
1278120	1281000	Don't know could I take on a high elf? I feel like I'm really weak
1282800	1289840	Apparently polar bears are actually the most aggressive breed of bear if you didn't know that grizzly bears actually avoid human intervention apparently right?
1289840	1291840	So we are Nordic
1292600	1297120	Seasons of Skyrim they are tall and fair haired people strong and hardy
1297120	1301960	Nord's are famous for their resistance to cold and their talent as warriors
1301960	1305440	They can use a battle cry to make opponents flee
1306120	1309920	Fantastic. Um, are we gonna be a man or a woman? Oh?
1310720	1312720	um
1313400	1315400	Oh
1315440	1319560	Okay, okay, just a few technicals. It's a technical difficulty

2265080	2270160	Can you check your difficulty? I think it's all bug. No, no, nothing wrong with the difficulty of the game
2270920	2275160	Wait, what do we need to oh wait? There's about to be an enemy that comes through a thing or something
2275320	2282240	We're about to jump on hope by tomorrow six at six. I would love that for all the girls. They're so excited
2288880	2291520	They can't see us they don't know
2292680	2297240	He can't see me at all is he like directly at me by the way. Oh
2300560	2304200	My god, I forgot how clunky the fricking if you're late
2305160	2307280	Oh my god, this is so clunky
2308880	2310880	Yes, yes a key a key
2312480	2314000	Take all
2314000	2320400	Definitely gonna quit these because they're a lot better than right. I know I'm dressing up as the enemy. Okay, but
2320680	2326600	That's heavy armor. We're gonna wait. Where the frick is the key or he gets the key. Okay?
2327640	2331040	Storm coke and drip in the same sentences oxymoronic
2331920	2333520	How do you they're both bad
2333520	2339200	But storm cooks are just worse the High King was leader of the good factions of Skyrim and he surrendered to the Empire because they were the
2339200	2345480	Less bad option. I didn't know that I thought it was like the Thalmor Embassy came in and they were like you can he worship
2345480	2350240	Talus anymore and I was like you can't he come into my company and tell me what I can do and can he do so
2350240	2352240	I'll pick this guy the storm cooks
2353200	2357520	Like you can't he just go and be doing that like that's a region's right. Where's the enemies? Oh
2358360	2359800	Oh
2359800	2366280	Yeah, that's right. Look at that come. Oh my god. It's so bad on PC like when we analog stick
2370200	2374720	Stealth goes from input. I don't know. I'm normally like a two-handed player
2374720	2380640	I'll always try to be an archer and I'll always end up two-handed because there's a really good freakin and
2382480	2384480	There's a really good
2388520	2391000	Enchantment which you can get from
2394720	2400600	Yes, sorry torturer. Yeah. Yeah, you're trying to tell me that a oh
2401720	2404800	She get in it. She annihilated him
2407960	2409960	No, I haven't seen him
2410360	2415040	You can lock pick these for like I guess we'll try it. So there's
2415760	2421760	You can literally smurf this if you leave and then shuggle it you hear that
2424320	2431520	Hear that if you do super gently see so we know know it's left side. Oh
2433920	2435920	I'm not getting pranked
2436200	2437480	There
2437480	2441800	You can literally smurf like all this stuff if you want it to be made you can pick up the stuff
2441800	2445640	But we are actually gonna sell it because it's good money
2445640	2450280	I don't think I think there's a shield behind here if you wanted to do. Yeah, if you want a shield then
2450920	2454480	There is one here, but I don't really bother a shield that I do two-handed
2454480	2457040	So we're gonna get a war hammer very shortly
2457320	2461080	There should be coins down here and one of these if I'm not mistaken
2461080	2469000	I guess 300 no 300 coins seems a bit extreme. Maybe 30 coins in there. We are just gonna blast through it
2470000	2471200	Um
2471200	2477560	Try two-handing mage mage is my fave. No two-handed warrior two-handed
2478000	2481360	Lightweight warrior and you can muck around with a bow and arrow
2481520	2485960	Like if you do the nightingale quest you get light armor. That's pretty sneaky
2486480	2492840	But the thief skilled armor especially for the stamina and like item increase is so good
2493720	2497880	and as for how we're gonna tackle what we do first
2498640	2504560	I'm going to purposefully do the companions quest line and then load a previous save
2505000	2510040	Because I don't like oh, sorry. Sorry. Hold on. I was out of stamina. I was trying to reach up and
2511000	2513000	that oh
2515280	2518840	I see just posted a very watery tweet. No way
2520160	2522560	the the piss corp
2523840	2526700	Accusations we ain't beating them today and we ain't beating them tomorrow
2527700	2530940	The nightingales. Yeah pure mage is hard mode. I
2531940	2537160	There should be something up here if I remember correctly on the right side of these rocks
2537620	2539780	What was it? Oh, it's just a weak coin purse
2540540	2548140	I got 14 gold. Honestly purse scaly boy. He's he's gone. He he couldn't get out, but the bars are broken now. I
2548920	2554440	Love the jewel wheels nightingale peeler. No, no peeler
2555220	2558880	That's awful, but that's hilarious at the same time
2561340	2565600	Right, there are spiders so if any of you are arachnophobic whoa
2567560	2569160	Don't worry
2569160	2574280	They are getting absolutely. Yeah, I've been poisoned. I think they give stamina for space
2574280	2579840	But yeah, please look away if you're arachnophobic. We are just gonna blast through this area
2580540	2582540	Did I come from here?
2584580	2589540	I think there's something to look up there. Maybe I don't know I can't
2590580	2597480	There is a bear ahead. I say look away, but you're too busy doing something on your alternative Twitter, so it's okay
2600300	2602300	She doesn't have to know
2602540	2605180	We are gonna take this for some really quick money
2605180	2611980	I believe there is an achievement for holding 100,000 gold at one stage the best way to make gold
2612000	2614000	I have found is
2614160	2615720	by
2615720	2618000	enchanting and selling that jewelry and
2619080	2623980	There is a bit of a mild strut that I devised myself. I don't know if it's the strut
2625400	2629600	Survival mode survival adds the need absolutely not. What is this?
2630320	2635900	Survival adds the need to eat sleep and stay warm also adds challenges such as no no and no
2636280	2640440	I want vanilla Skyrim. Oh my god. Is that is that PC?
2642760	2644760	I
2647360	2652400	Just really am I not am I not getting achievements on Xbox for this? I don't think I am
2653400	2655400	I'm not
2655400	2660440	I named the stream zero to 1,000. Well, that's a very accurate over them
2661640	2663640	Are you playing anniversary?
2664120	2669880	In additional challenge. Oh, well, we should have gone achievement there, but we're not playing Xbox. I'm dumb
2670380	2677180	Imagine having to eat each 10 cheese wheels. Um, so there is a really easy mine
2677180	2681780	You can clear out. I think it will give us two handed. Um, that's just there to head
2682300	2689980	It's like right in your oh, actually. Sorry the standard stones first standing stones. I believe there are 12 standing stones which give you a
2691180	2697140	Certain boosts such as a faster leveling XP under certain things. So there's a mage stone
2697140	2702560	There's a thief stone and there is a warrior stone, but there's different ones as well one
2702560	2708160	I believe is like a mule stone where you just straight up can carry more items on your persons
2708560	2713600	Yeah, literally activate thief activate mage activate warrior. We are gonna do thief
2716280	2719120	Are we gonna do thief what's warrior I've forgotten
2720760	2726080	Right, we'll do warrior normally I do thief but we will we're gonna clear out this mine very quickly
2726140	2733820	We're just gonna pick up ingredients as we go along the way of the stones the way work. Yeah, there should be achievement to find them all. Yes
2736340	2737580	Well
2737580	2744860	So that just not have achievements at all because I'm not I'm playing on Xbox game pass, but it's not like instance to
2746140	2748140	Xbox
2749020	2751400	Don't be too afraid of the wolves on the
2752400	2757740	They are to hit they can give you rock joint. Oh, I've gone past the mine already
2758420	2760180	They can give you
2760180	2763480	Is it no, it's a rock joint or is it lockjaw? I
2764740	2767240	Think it's rock joint. Oh
2769060	2776220	My memory of me I've gone so past this mine shaft. Yeah, here we go. Right. There should be a bad day out here. Hello
2777500	2779500	Yeah, yeah, yeah
2780320	2788560	You're playing a novice. No, no, these accusations are unfound. It is rock. I thought that but strong eight
2788560	2789720	Where is the
2789720	2794000	Blarney and yes, I know the Blarney stone. What?
2795200	2797200	Are you trying to make a ballamore joke?
2797520	2800360	There's a trip wire here in this mine, but don't worry about it
2800360	2809200	As I said, you can please get him up whatever level you want. I like blasting through and just absolutely annihilate and take this
2809920	2815360	Like it's so good. There are some later stages were even been on easy mode. Isn't that bad?
2815680	2821080	Although I have to admit. I guess this is registering as PC Skyrim and
2822080	2827740	It's quite different. Oh, this is so sad. They made this person mine themselves to death
2828520	2834280	They've had me working down here for days now. It's not the time that's getting to me though. It's these tunnels
2834280	2838440	I've told this countless times now to add extra support to the weak sections of the tunnel
2838460	2843220	If only we had more of these wooden beams that were we reinforced with bronze bottoms
2843660	2848220	Honestly, if I hear the earth shift one more time above my head, I'm so stressed. I may stop drinking for good
2848220	2853340	I mean, what's a Nord without his mead and he died because of a collapse in
2854060	2856420	So my granddad was a miner
2857380	2862380	and he used to tell me really rough stories about
2862800	2864800	Um
2865120	2871640	The he is like being in the mineshaft and all of that and they had a mine collapse and
2872360	2876920	Within two minutes. They had already killed the guy out and he was gone like he
2877720	2881600	Parish it was great. I may a minor. Yes
2882200	2883440	and
2883440	2890080	They do I think bandits normally have like a lockpick and coin, but it's not really the best
2890900	2892900	and
2893180	2896980	You can't just like straight up grab this shit, but there is a big chest in here
2896980	2903780	So we're just gonna clear out the way unless we oh, I was gonna say unless we speak but the guy's right there
2904620	2909420	And yeah, but like my granddad used to talk so openly about the
2910820	2912820	We just got it just like
2913300	2917020	Callers. Oh, no, hold on. Everyone knows I'm bad at log-picking now
2917560	2923480	Um, okay, we've got our first. What are you 20 damage rate 20 damage?
2928320	2930920	He like spoke so openly about it and I'm like
2931760	2933320	Granddad
2933320	2940240	Granddad, that's just straight up like stuff. That's like man-made like horrors beyond comprend comprehension type stuff
2940920	2942920	this chest
2943700	2948900	Okay, we're definitely on PC cuz amber does
2949620	2951780	Not look like that. What the heck?
2952540	2957580	What the heck? I've never seen that in Skyrim before am I going crazy or
2958580	2960580	I don't know
2960780	2962780	Right don't get ready to swing
2964900	2966900	Oh
2967880	2969320	Oh
2969320	2973760	And if the book is valued at 50 coins or more
2974000	2981580	You will level up reading that book if you are ever in a section and you're like what the heck are all these books if that book is
2981580	2983580	valued at 50
2983760	2987260	Septim or more then it is actually a skill book. Oh
2988200	2990200	Oh my god, that's so satisfying
2991280	2993920	That's so freaking satisfying
2996900	3000240	Hold on a minute. Yeah, that's a yeah, bone archer
3001760	3008800	Um, I think there's a tiny little chest on the edge here. I think there's a little bug with a difficulty
3008800	3013000	No, not at all. I'm playing on. Oh wait. It's just an a vein
3013640	3019720	If you didn't know and these are called veins when you can see the ore sticking out from the wall
3019720	3026720	It's quite interesting. Honestly, maybe I should talk about mining because my granddad spoke to me in big detail about it
3027380	3028980	and
3028980	3036500	Like how they used to come out and like their eyes really bloodshot red and everything and have I missed that chest back there?
3036500	3038980	I think I have but it's not a big deal
3042020	3046780	Yeah, I thought that and I just like I was like I've missed that chest having a bit fine
3046980	3051820	If you run where your weapon out your stamina will decrease, but that's okay. You don't really need it
3052820	3058180	Especially when you're just so good at the game like playing legendary mode like as I'm playing right now
3058180	3063580	If you didn't know I'm playing legendary mode like just because I'm such a pro everything becomes really easy
3063580	3068660	And you just have to like understand the strats as long as you like swing first
3069060	3075660	Basically, you win every fight and the reason why they hardly do any damage to me is
3076320	3080780	Because I have such high defense, of course and not any other reason
3081380	3086940	If you're looking for work, go see pot at the main rail off said you could help me
3087660	3089660	Reload you know him
3090460	3095180	He's a friend. He promised you could help we escaped from the amperials together did
3096140	3101340	We heard that all free cause she lied as easily should breathe. What are you talking about? This is legendary
3105100	3110140	Literally like I know it's hard to believe that a beach over is just so good at skyrim
3110220	3113260	That they can play legendary mode as casually as I can
3114140	3116140	But it's just it's just the way it is. Okay
3119260	3124860	So the area is now just discovering that dragons are coming back
3131500	3133500	Legendary easy one never heard of it
3134140	3136780	Legendary is easy mode because I'm just so skilled at this game
3137740	3141340	Open options and show that it's legendary fine. I will
3142780	3148620	I will show that it's legendary. Oh look what's over there? Hold on. What's over there?
3149340	3151180	Look a little to the left
3151180	3155660	Look a little to the left. See I thought see I told you it was legendary. I don't know
3156780	3158620	See
3158620	3163900	I don't know why you doubted me for a millisecond why this isn't legendary like I'm just that

3236860	3240140	Look, it's a hard pill to swallow to admit that sometimes
3240460	3244540	You know a girl may be better than you at a game, but that's okay. That's okay
3244860	3250540	You know, I'll stroke your ego. You stroke mine. You admit that I'm a legendary Skyrim player and admit that

3258780	3261580	We are gonna try and hit some of these markers

3750220	3754460	Is that john skyrim from the hit legendary show skyrim?
3755580	3759580	Yeah, but at the end of the fight you can decide to kill him or go away
3759820	3766860	I could have sworn he attacks me on xbox. I'm wondering if it's possible
3768220	3771340	Um, there might be a few coded differences
3772860	3776860	Battleborn give me your money. I don't have any money
3777660	3782780	Why didn't they hire me to be the mpc's like seriously? Could you imagine me like hanging a boot?

3807340	3809340	Um
3813260	3818300	So because we're not currently getting achievements like on steam or
3819260	3821260	here
3821820	3829100	I'm wondering if I should do a short two hour stream then come back and do the monetization stream possibly
3829980	3833660	I'm having to master debate about that. Um
3834620	3836460	Oh my god, there's a firefly
3836460	3841180	You cannot believe your eyes like 10 million fireflies

3942700	3947420	Um, I'll still leave the the light armor on. I know why are you doing two-handed with light armor?
3947500	3949500	Look, I just like light armor. Okay
3949580	3953660	Heavy armor. You'll never guess what heavy armor takes up a lot of room and it's heavy

3969340	3972620	Expires people head but I just do the helmet
3973660	3979420	We are in legendary. We can't let them house. Yeah, we're one shot right now. So we need to make sure we don't get hurt
3980460	3982460	Oh, I remember her
3982860	3987260	Going up these stairs for the first time and I was absolutely terrified of everything in this game
3988220	3989500	Oh
3989500	3995740	And I was I was probably oh, it's probably just the baby playing on the medium difficulty the default
3996700	4001500	Uh, oh, don't worry. We didn't actually get hit. Oh, we didn't get hit. That was called a whiff
4001580	4006380	That's that's what's known as a whiff in video games. Don't worry. Don't worry. We're still fine
4007980	4013500	No, the guy oh someone's shooting at me. I heard that bone. I don't know. Can I confess something if I
4013980	4017020	Ever play skyrim nowadays. I cheat with 300 speed
4017660	4021820	In speed malt command. What's that? I don't even know what that is. Uh
4022860	4025660	There should be a little dialogue. Did I have a bow and arrow?
4027180	4029180	I don't actually think I have a arrow
4029980	4032300	I had the chance to pick up a bow and I didn't
4033500	4035500	That's what I get for
4035820	4037820	No, don't worry
4038540	4040540	Oh, we're doing the golden claw. Oh my god
4040540	4045420	Right, I'm actually gonna pick up our bow for moments like that where we could legit just grab that stuff
4045420	4047420	There should be a little chest here. Oh, okay
4048060	4050060	Yeah, I'm a wee glaze. Go kiss
4053020	4058860	Oh such a good lock pick up 47 gold look we're not exactly breaking the bank here
4059580	4061580	Right. I think what I'll do
4061980	4063980	tomorrow
4065900	4067900	I'm just thinking
4068620	4073020	Why am I why I'm I'm so dumb and set this up but not to be on xbox game pass
4073660	4079420	Um, because I'm not getting any achievements. I think we'll do it. I'll play for two hours and we'll redirect into sheepsters
4080140	4085340	When she comes up and then I will replay everything that I achieved basically
4086140	4088860	Oh, this is supposed to be a tutorial if you don't
4089740	4093660	I've just upset him. He pulls it to show you that it's wrong
4094620	4097580	And I think he perishes here
4099580	4101580	But he's yeah
4103260	4106780	Yeah, it's like no health. So it's uh snake snake dolphin
4109180	4113740	You could just run the do the campaign and do monetization. Yeah
4114620	4116620	or yeah, actually maybe
4117340	4118780	um
4118780	4124140	Maybe we just do the main campaigns. I wouldn't actually I would be quite happy
4124780	4131580	and satisfied with skyrim again if the book is worth more than 50 gold if we do the main quest lines instead
4132300	4133980	then
4133980	4139820	I would actually be happy with what we've achieved with skyrim and we can oh my god. I forgot there's rats here. Hold on
4140300	4144220	Oh, I'm getting bit to death. Oh Mars. Oh my god. The swing is so bad
4144780	4148540	This swing is terrible. I know I should level up. I'm saving it
4148700	4152220	If you didn't know leveling up actually fully heals you. So if you're ever getting a
4153020	4155020	In a bit of a pickle
4155020	4157020	Why didn't you warn him?
4157180	4160620	Yes, actually, I wouldn't mind that today. We'll do an endurance stream if that's okay
4163340	4165900	Oh, this is freaking terrifying
4167980	4171660	Oh, he's actually quite a busy boy like honestly
4172620	4174620	Oh my god, he's just stabbed me
4175180	4177660	Wait, something else is red. I don't know. Hi

4204540	4206140	Red I
4206140	4208140	this cold
4208540	4213340	He's actually one of the stronger enemies in the dungeon be as a script to death and insta dies
4214060	4216060	Where's the golden claw?
4216300	4220540	It works the claw the markings the door in the hall of stories. I know how they all fit together
4221500	4223500	Help me down and I'll show you
4223740	4228940	Same like a bandit attacking after take down a dragon literally hand over the claw first
4229340	4234940	Does it look like I could move you have to cut me down. Okay. No, you're kind of real for that. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking
4236300	4240860	It's coming loose. I can feel it. Hello. I'm sure you wouldn't betray me
4241820	4243500	Would you?
4243500	4245500	Why should I share the treasure with anyone?
4245660	4248220	Why are you are you just leading me there?
4249020	4251020	You feel I'm not sharing it with anyone
4252460	4254460	Is he about to get
4254460	4256460	rolled by a drogger
4257260	4259260	Is he
4260860	4264460	I knew it. He is wait. Sorry. There's one behind me
4267900	4272300	He actually does I didn't know he was scripted to do that. I always kill him instantly
4272860	4279820	I saw mudcrabs the other day horrible creatures. Wait. Yeah, so it's on his person. Should we read his journal?
4280940	4282700	Left trigger read
4282700	4288700	My fingers are trembling the golden claws finally in my hands and with it the power of the ancient nordic heroes that
4288860	4295980	Fool lucian valerius has no idea that his favorite store decoration was actually the key to bleak falls
4296380	4301740	Tharu now I just need to get to the hall of stories and unlock the door the legends say
4301820	4305180	There is a test that the nord's put in place to keep the unworthy way
4305500	4310380	But that when you have the golden claw the solution is in the palm of your hand
4312140	4317340	Oh, shit. Okay. I saw that coming. I'm so sorry. I saw that coming. I stood right on that trap
4318060	4321340	Oh, shit. Why when I use a stamina move
4322220	4327500	Stop holding the freaking stamina bar. Holy crap. When I do a stamina move it like makes me go to the side
4328300	4332060	Literally the only thing that's going to hurt me in this game is um
4334540	4336540	Is uh traps nothing else
4341980	4343980	Spider girl for gen two
4344700	4346700	Hmm
4347020	4351340	So there's one I don't want to talk about it too much just for my baby girls like
4352140	4356780	We are only a weekend. Wait, is there a drogger here? I'm a little crazy. No, um
4357900	4363020	Obviously, I don't want to disrespect the baby girls. Um, I was talking to them
4364300	4367100	about like how development works behind the scenes
4367260	4368460	um
4368540	4373500	And unfortunately, I used my words pretty poorly and it made some of them a bit uncomfortable
4373580	4379260	So I don't really like talking about it too much. Um, but it's due to my poor communication
4379340	4381820	It's not due to the the girls in any way
4382460	4384460	um
4384700	4386940	But I what I can say is that
4387820	4390940	development takes a year at least
4391660	4393660	for uh generation
4394220	4396860	Like an entire generation if you will
4397420	4398860	um
4398860	4403340	And like I I don't want to say too much to make the girls feel like oh
4403740	4409420	I'm just like casting them aside because like oh shiny gen two like no, that's absolutely not the case like
4410060	4414780	I have said this from the start. Um if there is going to be a gen two
4414860	4417340	It will be at least a year away like I am
4417900	4423580	I am not rushing gens out just for the sake of doing it. That's that's so unbelievably disrespectful
4424380	4426620	To the girls who have placed faith in me
4427100	4428540	um, and
4428540	4433420	Like I still have a load of plans like now that the girls are in the stage of being monetized. Um
4433980	4440860	There's a lot of plans we can now execute. Um, like shorts as well. There's a lot of shorts that need to be made. Um, we have a fantastic
4441660	4446060	shorts editor who did a Hail Mary to the website and applied themselves
4446620	4450860	Um, and he's he's been a fantastic shorts editor
4451020	4454060	He's pretty much done the majority of the work. We have a a second one
4454460	4459260	Who's quite busy at the moment, but we are gonna, you know, test if it's all good and if it's all good then
4460060	4462620	You know, we've got a lot of shorts play coming up. Um
4463500	4466620	confirmed not a black company. I I hope not I
4467180	4472700	I said to the girls wholeheartedly and hopefully they will voucher. They remember I said something along the lines
4473100	4480060	I oh, I wasn't paying attention. Sorry. Um, I said if I ever do anything to you that is
4480860	4488540	Like absolutely hurting you that hurts you in any way that is a completely negative experience with me in any way
4489020	4495100	Take me out back and shoot me. Um, like it was it's why I was very serious in the interview
4495260	4499100	Uh, they they are welcome to talk about the interview if they would like, um, am I going the wrong way?
4499100	4501900	Am I going back the way I came? No, I'm not. Um
4502700	4504620	I said to them
4504620	4509980	Do not ever refer to me as your boss. Do not ever think of me as like a superior or something like that
4510460	4512460	Um, that's definitely not
4513020	4520220	Ever how I want you to think like I am literally like in this with you. We're we're memeing about we're figuring out what we want to do like, um
4522060	4529660	Definitely take me out back and shoot me. I'm so serious. Do not ever ever let me like oh, that's
4530460	4534300	It does more damage. Um, like do not ever take me like
4535500	4538140	You know, what's that saying you live long enough to become the villain
4538140	4541820	Don't ever let me live become don't ever let me live long enough to become the villain
4541900	4543340	Take me out back and shoot me like oh
4543340	4549740	It's why from the get go like if the girls sign on their contract for another year. Uh, we the company
4550380	4551260	um
4551260	4556460	We offer an alternative outfit on the house for them as well as their pay increase
4557020	4557580	goes
4557580	4562540	Sorry, I'm fucking try to like remember the the attack pattern and where the droggers spawn in this
4563180	4565100	we'll talk about this but um
4565100	4568780	Like uh, we definitely wanted to raise their income and the split goes
4569420	4573900	85 15 again kind of showing that we're not really here for grade. We're kind of here for
4574540	4576540	alternative reasons. Um
4576860	4579420	So is there an actual see oh, I don't own the company
4580540	4583020	Like I genuinely wholeheartedly my my my name
4583900	4585100	I'm
4585100	4591340	Basically my role is what is a creative director. I already if you look on the
4591900	4596860	Thingy it'll tell you what the code is but you just need to move these twice and then you've got the correct code
4597420	4600860	Unless it's different on pc. Uh, but basically I'm
4601820	4607180	I was the creative director because I did used to have the scripts like I used to be the script maker
4607500	4614220	I no longer have that there's no a manager. All I do right now is stream as strone as me
4614860	4619660	Um, and I send away shorts like I literally went into the girls dms
4620460	4622460	Last night like after streams
4622540	4627740	And I was like, hey, um, can I get an audio of you saying this and they're like, yeah, I'll do it in the morning
4627820	4629820	Like that's that's all I do
4630620	4635820	Uh, you're a cco. I don't know what a cco is. You're already like the opposite of a black company
4637580	4638700	Ah
4638700	4640700	I mean you're ready to be dragonborn
4641740	4644300	Word of power learn force
4644940	4646940	unrelenting force
4646940	4648940	force
4649420	4653260	um, there's always an overlord or um some sort of
4653820	4655500	um
4655500	4661900	Protector of the words of power, which you know makes sense all things considered
4662540	4664540	Uh, oh, we're gonna break that down
4668460	4670460	Chief creative officer, um
4672380	4676540	Nah, I've uh, we're just gonna break everything down and
4677340	4679900	I think there's a hidden chest by this waterfall
4680700	4683260	Although I could be completely wrong. Oh, well, no
4684620	4688460	Damn my memory coming through it's been how many years since I played this game and I'm like, yeah
4688540	4692300	There's a wee hidden chest here. Then there's this there and then you can pick this up and then I do that
4692300	4695020	Oh my god. So mlg pro honestly, um
4697020	4699020	Wow you a
4699100	4704140	Cuted that based on honestly force sounds like the german word foo, which means food
4704780	4709420	Oh, did you like my foos last night? Huh? Did did you like them streams?
4710140	4713100	Tell me I don't have I feel so feminine right now
4713660	4715660	I'm like the most feminine
4716140	4720220	I might get more pedicures because honestly that that that was so fun. I enjoyed it
4720620	4725980	The woman was so like both the women were so lovely. I felt so flustered in that stream though
4726380	4728380	I hope it didn't come across too badly
4728380	4734140	But I was like so out of my element like when I saw the time was an hour until
4734940	4741980	A sheepsters was up. I was like, oh my god. What have I done? Like, how did I speedrun it? It's like so quickly
4744140	4746140	Have you got back the tool?
4746860	4749660	Um, it's still unfortunately very
4750540	4756860	Cut up. So I've still got a wee bandaid on it. I washed it in the bath
4757820	4761900	Uh, she got me good. All I'm gonna say is she got me good. Like it was deep
4761980	4766220	You know, like the side the smaller side part of your tool cuts straight into that
4767820	4771820	She was really sorry though, but it's fine like stuff happens honestly
4771900	4775740	And I believe she was new I believe she was new to the establishment. So it's better to
4776380	4780780	It's better for her to make a mistake on me because like hopefully I'm nice and understanding
4780860	4784380	And they're like, I wouldn't say anything mean. I was like, oh, you're fine. Like don't worry about it
4784940	4788860	Um, and like the other women was like translating for her because she didn't speak English
4788940	4792380	And I was like, it's fine. So I'm kind of glad she made that mistake on me
4792700	4799020	Rather than someone else who would have been like a Karen basically like I'm not gonna say anything about Australia, but um
4800540	4802540	I have I have heard some
4803180	4804540	unique

4930780	4936540	But i'm going to need your guys's help for the tally. Um, you can just run ahead of arolith
4936940	4939340	Um, it's not necessary to hang about
4939900	4944620	Shawnee has the wrong kind of tism to pay attention to multiple things. That was yeah, I can't do that
4944860	4946700	I can like hyper
4946700	4953340	This is they call it hyper focus. I don't think it's even hyper focus. I'm not focused at all. I'm just having a really good time
4954060	4959900	Um, but yeah, I'm very lucky that I don't experience like burnout or anything. I'm like, yeah, I can't really
4961180	4965740	Oh, sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that you're having such a tough time. Oh, yeah
4966300	4967820	um
4967820	4973500	All right, hold on. I'm gonna unlock this little windmill as a landmarker when you
4973980	4975980	Papaga farm as terrible
4976380	4981660	When you discover a landmark you can fast travel to it which gets you
4982620	4984620	Around a lot faster
4985740	4987740	um
4988380	4994380	Did you know that with frostbills you can make dragons land? I did not know that I always use that shout
4995980	4999500	Um to get them to land. Oh, it's so pretty. Look at the butterfly
5000540	5004220	Oh my god catch the butterfly rip its wings off for alchemy
5004940	5006940	yes
5006940	5008940	Oh
5010380	5015980	Okay, now we need to wait for the game to hurry up with the mpc. So we're just gonna wait an hour
5016460	5018460	Oh, there we go. Boom. Just like that
5020380	5022380	No burnout. Look at you
5023340	5028860	I just don't experience it. I like I've never experienced that. I've never had issues with that. I don't feel it like
5030140	5035180	I can feel tired like I can be like, oh, I need to go get some like tea and some food
5035180	5039500	And then we'll play like for a couple of more hours. I can do that. No problem. Like at all
5040460	5045180	I think the only time I feel I just feel frustrated that I don't have more time
5045820	5050300	Like when I was doing all the ASMR collabs like writing all the scripts back to back
5050860	5056140	Um, actually I knew girl, uh, I reached out to a new girl and I was like, hey, you want to do ASMR
5056140	5061740	And she was like, I want to do some more and she's like, I know a lot about you and I was like, oh, that's embarrassing
5061980	5067020	Um, but if you know a lot about me, then you know how easy this collab is gonna be because I'll do all the work
5068380	5075340	Um, but like I don't mind doing all the work if anyone's lurking. Uh, I don't mind doing the work. I actually prefer it
5076220	5078220	Um, because it makes things a lot easier
5079340	5081340	And make every arrow count
5081580	5084700	I used to not experience burnout playing games, but now I do which is a shame
5085420	5089340	No, so if you can't play video games, that's like life burnout
5089340	5094460	Like if you would rather watch someone else play video games than like play it yourself
5095820	5100940	Live streaming doesn't count because you're you're being tortured to watch me play Skyrim via
5101900	5105100	My controller where the heck is this dragon? Is he on the floor? Oh, it is
5106300	5108300	Okay
5108620	5110620	Oh, let's spank his butt
5110620	5111820	Ah
5111820	5117580	Whoa, it's actually kind of hurt me a little bit. No, you're stinking. You're so stinking
5117820	5119820	Um
5120780	5125100	See they've been on top. Hey stamina bar is greet out only HP
5125740	5127740	What's the way? Oh, it's landed again
5128860	5130860	Oh, you're hurting me
5132780	5138140	Stop it. You're hurting me. Oh look at that two hand is 32. I should probably level that up
5138620	5143900	Hey, we are gonna pick up the dragon bones. These are like why on earth? Oh, he must eat a weight ring guard
5144860	5146220	um
5146940	5148540	No
5148540	5153820	So now this is where the NPCs get really weird around you. I don't know what he's fighting right now
5154620	5159260	He's locked on something a mud crab. Maybe nearby. There's mud crabs over that way
5161820	5166140	Today I learned from a scottish cut of fish. I may have burned out. Yes. So if you'd rather
5167740	5169740	Um, if you would rather
5171020	5173020	Um
5173580	5175580	Wow
5178700	5183580	Where that where the heck I think he's supposed to come up to me. Is it you?
5184860	5186860	I'm glad you're on outside
5188700	5198460	Uh normally an NPC walks up to you and goes oh my god, you are the dragonborn in a really poor like swedish accent
5198780	5200780	Uh
5202300	5206860	What type of two hand are we specializing in hammer axe sword those there's
5207980	5209980	Aren't those one handed
5210220	5212220	I'm just gonna pick up with the apocrity
5212780	5214780	Apocrity something like that
5215180	5217180	Did he die? I guess they may have perished
5217740	5225340	Yeah, I've been uninspired by the games to play recently. So I prefer watching others play. Yes. I think that is a symptom of burnout because of
5228460	5230460	Oh
5231980	5236780	I think the gray beards have summoned us
5238860	5240860	Oh, it's khaji
5242300	5246380	We're the good boy. Hey, push push push. Do you seek to make a purchase?
5247100	5252380	Uh, uh, what have you got for sale? I'm gonna just sell some of my stuff that I don't want
5253260	5255980	Uh, I'm gonna break that break it down now
5256940	5264540	I'm gonna break all this stuff down. It's just so we're not too heavy. Yeah, I can break those down
5266060	5269020	Take rid of that. We did that. We're gonna break it down

5274380	5279980	Resurrect and restore my energy. Would I do amber? I'll just sell that. I don't really know
5280620	5282620	Oh, I definitely want to sell this
5283580	5287020	I like how my speech gets better just selling stuff in general like
5287580	5290940	You always want to hold on to soul gems. Uh, they're very important
5291900	5296860	May the road lead to oh, that's why I always say safe travels land strider because of this game
5296940	5299420	I think it's really cute. Just safe travels land strider
5300620	5302620	khaji roleplay stream
5303100	5305100	Uh
5305980	5309500	I actually don't know how to purr. You know how some v-tubers can purr like
5309740	5313580	Uh, I can't do it. I can only roll my r by the pope
5314380	5319020	Even the graybeards screaming your name strani you absolute sexy player
5319500	5321660	Thank you for the tip. Sorry. Yeah, or sorry. Yeah
5322380	5324380	I think they're y'all

5338380	5344460	Uh, someone but we're not doing that quest right now because we're trying to zoom past this so we can go and do
5345180	5346700	the
5346700	5348700	Main quest of the dragonborn
5349500	5351980	I'm wearing a hat with badass horns
5353260	5358460	I'm the dover king known globally. You're nobody at all
5358780	5362060	He was so english in those songs for no reason
5362780	5366700	I'm just kidding. It is his accent. He's allowed to have an accent
5367740	5373260	If it's gosh, I'm dover king known globally. You're nobody at all. Like it. Yeah
5374060	5377900	I think the english rapping accent is a bit better than the scots
5379980	5381980	Was the dragon there
5382620	5388620	Uh, the watch tower was destroyed, but we killed the dragon. Let's just skip a few dialogue and say it turns out
5388620	5390620	I might be dragonborn
5391820	5394300	What do you know about the dragonborn?
5394620	5399340	Hmm when the dragon died, I absorbed some kind of power
5403740	5407900	The vampire DLC, I don't even think I saw that one the graybeards
5409500	5411580	Okay, okay, okay, we get a blah blah blah blah wait
5413100	5418700	Why does it say I need to keep? Oh, I need to keep talking to him. You've done a great service for me

5425340	5427340	Oh, I'm stain of the sick
5428540	5432780	I am so sorry for creating a mess. That was a misfire. It was a misinput misinput
5433180	5437980	Please don't fight me. I didn't mean to do that. I was the wrong the wrong button there
5440220	5443580	Axe of white on target dies within three second fills the soul gem
5443660	5446540	That's perfect because it's exactly the enchantment we want
5446940	5448940	Hey, we're gonna break it down now
5450700	5452700	Just breaking down everything
5453020	5457420	Um, and we're gonna see if we can enchant our Nordic battle axe
5457900	5461740	Although I even have soul gem. I have the world's weakest soul gem
5463900	5466780	I'm gonna have to refill it so much if I end up using it
5469820	5471820	Uh
5471980	5474940	Uh, this is the best I can do
5475740	5477740	Ah freaking mistake
5479340	5483180	Uh, we're just gonna oh we're completely out of soul gems anyway
5484780	5492380	Women yells it. I'm sorry. It was a misinput. It was a misinput. I'm so sorry. Look, I'm the I'm the thane
5492700	5494700	Anyway, I'm the I'm a thane
5494860	5498620	Oh Lydia, do you want to come with us so you can be filled with dragon bones?
5498620	5504060	Yarl has appointed me to be your house. Follow me. I need you. Oh my god. Wait. If I got Lydia's face
5504140	5506140	Am I going crazy or do I have Lydia's face?
5506620	5509420	Wait a minute. Did I accidentally recreate Lydia?
5510220	5512700	Wait, take take that helmet off right now
5514060	5517340	I think I may have accidentally recreated Lydia. Oh
5518460	5519660	No
5519660	5525100	I'm I'm such a Lydia fan boy. I recreated her as myself
5525820	5529020	Oh my god, we even have the same nose and lips and everything
5529820	5536380	That is hilarious. I'm so sorry Lydia. I'm just such a I must have like subconsciously made her
5538060	5544060	This that shoutings making people nervous on it till winning Lydia cuttles for real for real
5544700	5549980	Right. We now need to go all the way up this mount. Well, we need to go to Rorik's stead
5550140	5554220	I versus it. Oh my god. I'm such a fake gamer. Honestly. I don't even know why you guys listen to me half the time
5555900	5563100	Uh, Tony's copied my whole flow word for word bar for bar. It's a highland coup
5563500	5565500	Excuse me little gait. Let me just close that
5565900	5571900	Let me just close that. Oh, it's the wee highland coup. Look at this. No, uh, whoa. Whoa
5573100	5575100	Look at your wee horns
5575100	5583740	Fun, uh, I mentioned this other day actually, uh, I had a relative that owned one and uh, the the they're actually super gentle
5584300	5587580	Uh, but it made my relative blind in one eye lamal
5588380	5591500	Because the horn poked his eyeball. Um, that was funny
5592540	5595580	Uh, but it wasn't even mad at her
5596060	5600620	It was a female highland coup. I can't even remember what he named there, but honestly, it sounds like the most scottish
5601340	5603740	No, I don't care about your question. Shut the fuck up. Um,
5605020	5606460	literally
5606460	5611660	I honestly must sound so scottish to stream like oh, I have my granddad. Uh used to work in the mines
5612380	5616380	Had a family that family member that literally owned a highland coup. Like oh my god
5616460	5621740	I swear like me wonder I was raised in a bar and literally don't have manners. Like I just I never had it from the start
5624780	5630060	A wee coup, a wee highland coup. My favorite part of a strong stream is our unofficial catchphrase. Did you know?
5630940	5632940	Oh, did you know?
5633180	5634780	Did you know?
5634780	5638540	Uh, right, I think we're gonna manually walk there. There are gonna be wolves ahead
5638620	5644060	But because we're playing legendary differently and I'm such an MLG pro at this game. Um
5645420	5649100	It's honestly not problem and we might even see Cicero on the way
5649180	5653260	It's unlikely we'll meet Cicero on the way there just because he spawns
5653820	5662220	I find the Cicero spawns more northern west of the map and we are currently going southern east, which is the opposite
5662940	5663980	Um
5663980	5665900	Lydia
5665980	5671580	No, hello. This war is as stupid as our feud with clan gray may need something. No
5673100	5680940	Oh, oh, she's got a bit of them. Oh, what was that shadow freaking the honeybearing meadery. Uh, yes a bit of a bit of meadery
5681740	5684380	Oh, wait, will we open a veal or a meadery? Why not?
5685740	5687740	that seems to be the way of like
5688300	5689340	um
5689340	5693420	Content creators when they get in their endgame they like come out with a product. I'm like
5693980	5698140	I think my endgame would be video games like
5699020	5702620	Like paying to get them made like what what my my rubbish ideas are
5703260	5706700	Um, I think that's probably my endgame. Whoa, okay
5707420	5711820	That was that was a lot going on the screen for one for one. So
5712860	5716540	That was quite a lot. There is a waystone up ahead. I don't think it's a good one
5717420	5719420	Haggis and
5720220	5722220	Neeps and ties
5723420	5726780	Do you also live in a lone tower up on some hill? Are you?
5727980	5733340	Wait, oh, no, is this an enemy dog? No, it's a nice dog. Hello. I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years
5734380	5737420	I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years
5738060	5744380	Are you telling me my lore story is shrek right now? You can buy dragon scale. You've not got the money for it
5745420	5746780	our
5746780	5748780	Wah, wah, wah
5749740	5752460	The other drinks it may or may not contain something
5753260	5757660	Unique to the girl. I see that skeever on the road. Don't think I can't see you. We are
5758780	5762700	Oh, so captured that that is the noise. I like to hear honestly
5763180	5766380	Uh, I believe there's a few skeletons up on this hill, but
5766940	5768940	Again, nothing we can't handle
5769100	5771100	Nothing we can't handle at all
5772460	5776300	Um, as I said, we're gonna do the main quest. We're gonna do the thieves
5776700	5781980	Um, and then hello, are you you are definitely an enemy? Oh
5783500	5787580	I do beg your pardon, but it's all the way absolutely nothing around these parts
5790380	5792620	And another soul capture do you have soul gem?
5793580	5796460	Spark white cap will destroy those. Oh
5797500	5798540	Oh
5798540	5800540	Oh, how dare you
5800700	5801820	Do you?
5801820	5806540	Oh, wait, I think that ancient that ancient bow is stronger than what we have for our bow. Um
5807660	5811580	Right root skeletons scared. Oh scary
5814060	5816060	Are you squiddling me right by the pope?
5817020	5821260	I don't like my family history every time I read my family history
5821340	5824540	I always have to ask myself. Are we the bad guys?
5825100	5826940	Monka is
5826940	5828940	Thank you for the tip
5829740	5831740	Are we the bad news
5831900	5834300	I think my family history is like really boring
5835500	5837500	It's just like, yeah
5837820	5839820	Scottish and Irish
5840780	5845660	I know that you can do like 23 and me tests to like really see where you come from
5846140	5849420	But I actually don't uh, I don't
5850140	5854220	Believe it's safe at all to like willingly hand over your dna like that
5854460	5859100	Look, I know I'm starting to send like needy streamer overload where we were doing like that god speed run
5859180	5865100	Where she you know, she got into like all the conspiracy theories and stuff, but it's not really a conspiracy thing
5866380	5868860	I like maybe I should do a stream like that on ironically
5869580	5875260	I'll like yeah. Um, wait, what are you attacking? You're not attacking me. Oh, you're not. Okay, that's strange
5877100	5879820	Uh, this gaily sounded like an oblivion scaly
5880540	5882780	At least you got a cool accent out of the deal. Yeah
5883740	5890140	Um, we are just running our way over to mvark said I believe is the town name award you kind of forgot the annunciation
5891900	5893340	Um
5893340	5897100	No, I don't think it's safe either to have your dna on fail of a company. Yeah, like
5897740	5899260	um
5899260	5901260	I took like ethics class
5901580	5902540	um
5902540	5904220	and we were
5904220	5911500	Discussing like how good like emergent technology is like if you haven't heard about crisper is dna fixing technology
5911580	5919340	Essentially dna fixing. Um, it's going through a lot of lab studies and trials and all that but it's found very effective against like, um
5920940	5925740	You know things that were previously incurable essentially or diseases that are
5926380	5928860	untreatable that kind of thing um and
5930140	5933580	The technology that can be raised from it
5934140	5939580	Um to help people is outstanding. However, do we
5940460	5942460	Do we trust such?
5942460	5947740	Do we trust your dna sequence to be handled with care or would in theory
5948460	5954620	Insurance help. I'm sorry. I'm literally hell. Yeah. I'm up for scotland conspiracy theory stream
5955260	5962540	Thank you so much. Totally not big anger. Um, like I I could definitely get into it, but we were like talking about like
5963820	5969260	Uh, didn't see one of the interest your companies get caught selling all the data. They said they wouldn't is that yes
5969660	5971660	uh, not to mention, um
5972540	5978140	There's like a whole rabbit hole about what data leaks are. Um, because
5979100	5980860	um
5980860	5986540	I don't know. I don't know if you guys care, but um, there's actually a whole other conspiracy
5987180	5993020	Um, that data leaks aren't actually like that. It's kind of more like government demands
5993500	5996700	Uh to have access, but they already kind of have access to a lot of things
5997100	5999100	Especially with the technology in the state age
5999100	6004620	But uh, maybe I shouldn't go too far down the rabbit hole. Don't want to deter anyone. Where the heck am I supposed to go?
6005100	6008140	I think there's a path ahead. I'll just follow this path. Um,
6008780	6013580	I thought we were going down the designer baby route. Oh, well that already happened
6013740	6019340	One of the biggest examples of the designer baby route was victoria beckham's children
6019660	6025420	You're telling me that brown-eyed lady has a 25 percent of uh, blue-eyed offspring
6025740	6029580	And she just happened to pop out two blue-eyed children. Uh, no
6030060	6036700	She did what is called ivf and then the dna tested and checked if the children
6037100	6039660	And in the egg in the egg. Yes in the egg
6040140	6044060	Uh, we're able to uh had the recessive blue eyes
6044380	6050220	Is already being done in this day and age and that was back in 2005 or something crazy. It's one of the biggest public
6051020	6055020	Things that are right in the faces of people that you wouldn't know about it's already occurring today
6055100	6061100	This also occurs with the fox p12 gene. I believe I'm so sorry if no one cares about this
6061660	6065980	But I'll try and get through it really quickly. There's also a gene that's been identified called the fox p12
6065980	6066780	I believe
6066780	6072700	Um, and if you have it it means you're actually a lot smarter and able to pick up things a lot easier than someone who is
6072700	6078700	Without this gene and uh, it's been called into question that ivf babies may also be getting tested for this
6078700	6081580	So you have a child or offspring that may be a bit smarter than the average
6082140	6085020	But that's just on me. Okay, uh, I'll just leave it
6085740	6088620	Leave it there, but there there's a lot. There's a lot
6089660	6090860	Okay
6090860	6091820	um
6091820	6094860	It's really interesting to continue the happen. Yes
6094940	6100940	So a lot of people think it hasn't already occurred or the first human hasn't been cloned and dolly the first sheep was cloned in
6100940	6104140	1964 I believe uh the no no no no no
6104380	6109260	That's when we first were publicly allowed to be learned and to be taught about the cloning
6109740	6113100	Um, it's already happened long ago
6113260	6118140	You just don't get to know about it because ethnically it's messed ethnically
6118620	6126700	Ethically it's messed up and the public shouldn't really be allowed to access this knowledge because well it brings up a lot of questions
6127100	6129100	Such as if you call in a person
6129260	6130140	Do they have one soul?
6130140	6132700	Do they share a soul and then it brings religion into question
6132860	6137180	If you didn't know religion also helps bring in a lot of order into people's and communities lives
6137420	6139260	And the rabbit hole goes incredibly deep
6139260	6142860	But we can't touch on that subject too much because i'm just a vtuber playing skyrim right now
6143020	6148300	And we're just trying to get to every head so we can talk to the graybeards to learn about our true power as the dragonborn
6148460	6150460	As we play this game
6153260	6155260	So yes, please don't mind me
6155660	6158140	Oh, this is a saber cat after me. My goodness
6158780	6160460	um
6160460	6162460	But yes, uh, please
6163100	6168220	Please let us enjoy skyrim for what it is. Anyway, that's why I don't really start talking about these subjects
6169100	6170540	because uh
6170540	6172060	Yeah, it's uh
6172060	6176060	It's a bit scary. It's a bit scary when you look into it. Yeah, right? Uh, yeah
6176860	6180620	Gamers for genetically engineered cat girls represent absolutely
6180620	6185740	I'm 100% there with you the fact that nickel girls aren't real. I used to right. This sounds really bad
6185740	6189180	I used to actually fantasize about owning a nickel girl. I don't know why I just
6190540	6193340	I used to fantasize about like treating her really well
6193740	6198780	And like she would have had a previous owner before me or something, but i'll treat you right baby
6199180	6204620	I don't know why I gave me like some sort of like superior like saving complex or something
6204860	6209500	I don't know why but like I just oh I used to fantasize about all of that
6209500	6213660	Like especially after watching monster monster
6214220	6216220	mom
6217260	6219260	Um, I used to like really
6219980	6224140	Uh, there should be a quest where you deliver something for someone
6225340	6227340	Is it you?
6228060	6232060	Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop. Oh, okay, right. Sorry, jeez
6232860	6234860	Um
6235420	6239500	If this dream doesn't demonstrate that the tism is strong and veal or literally to the box
6239900	6241900	There's someone that gives you a quest
6253500	6256700	Okay, we're gonna yet if you talk to this guy you can do a quest for him
6257660	6259260	Um
6259260	6261260	There's also a hidden
6261900	6262940	Thing
6262940	6266060	If you read all of these on the way up something happens
6266060	6270460	But I've completely forgotten what happens because I've never done it before because I saw it in a video
6270700	6272700	And I've forgotten what happened in the video
6274060	6279580	Uh, right, let's see emblem one before the birth of men the dragons ruled all of
6279980	6281980	Mondus their words
6283260	6287260	Their word was the voice and they spoke only for true needs
6287740	6291260	For the voice could blot out the sky and flood the land
6294140	6297260	Well four years means more years to tease
6299340	6304620	Honestly what necopara does to mf for me honestly

6312140	6316220	Thank you. Hypno mama. Thank you for us dino. I apologize
6316940	6319500	Just saying cloning has never been perfect
6320060	6323660	And there has been a growth in mental health as time has gone on
6324140	6330140	We are all clones of our grandfathers grandmothers, but imperfect to poison the king cool
6330700	6336780	Thank you. Thario for the tip. I could talk about um, so you know how like the older generations thing is like
6336860	6340300	Oh the lead paint stair because they'd been exposed to lead so much
6341020	6341980	um
6341980	6346460	My freaking biggest thing is that they've known about micro plastics forever
6346780	6351580	And uh, I actually got proven right. It has been supra. Wait, did I miss an emblem?
6354060	6356940	No, I didn't hello. How are you?

6376940	6378940	Thank you for us dino. Thank you. Thario
6380060	6384620	Yeah, micro plastics are today's lead plane apparently they're in the skin of men
6385740	6389260	Uh, are I read something about it being in the skin of men?
6390300	6393660	I don't know if it's true or not or if I got trolled. I believe anything I read
6394300	6398060	Men are born and spread over the face of mondice the dragons
6398700	6404220	President over the crawling masses men were weak then and had no voice
6406300	6412300	There is something about men's skin having micro plastics in it or something to do with their dingle whoppers
6413900	6417260	Uh, you got you got plastic in your dingle whopper right now. Please be honest

6473500	6476540	Uh, I don't know how to give nothing
6477020	6482460	Emblem three the fledging spirit of men were strong in old times unafraid to war with
6483020	6488780	Unafraid to war with dragons and their voice, but the dragons only shouted them down and broke their hearts
6491420	6493420	Random Netherlands, uh, yeah
6494540	6498220	Thank you. Well, thank you. Well, we're listening to my random Dutch
6498780	6503340	If I recall correctly all the men they tested had micro plastic in their
6504300	6510940	Yeah, so my my biggest thing I'm on right now is that they knew about micro plastics years ago
6511580	6516540	And oh in the name of capitalistic profits, uh, they let us all get poisoned
6516940	6523020	But that's just me. Anyway, if anyone's wondering why I really like need to shoot my overload and that one particular, uh, achievement
6523500	6526380	Uh, that one particular route you could take. Hmm. I wonder why
6527100	6529100	Uh, we um
6529660	6535980	I uh came across a documentary where the woman actually submitted because she did find it and she got laughed out at the company
6536540	6537820	and
6537820	6543980	Yeah, I was like 20 years ago, but it's been known for it's been known from the start. So it's very cruel

6568220	6570700	Oh, someone's mad. What are you doing walking the steps?
6571500	6573500	Meditating on the emblems
6573660	6577900	I make this trip every few have I turned off the thing. Wait, why apparently?
6578540	6582380	Tomatoes are the best thing to help your
6583260	6588460	Ball health. I don't know why just tomatoes are really good for you. You can have it on a pizza

6699100	6701580	Man prevailed shouting Alduin out of the world
6701820	6708460	Providing for all that their voice too was strong although their sacrifice were many fold. Oh, yes

6747900	6752940	Bounding the first empire with sword and voice whilst the dragons withdrew from this world
6753900	6756300	Am I still getting can I hide from him?
6757740	6759740	Can he still see me? No
6760060	6767180	Is he coded to come all the way this way? I forget the sky room's like pretty sandboxed. So I think he can come all this way
6768220	6769820	Can he come?
6769820	6771820	Is he still coming?
6771820	6774220	I'm like I'm like hiding behind this pillar. Is he there?
6778220	6780220	It's okay. It's okay
6782060	6784220	Level up it gives full health. Oh, I forgot about that
6786220	6788380	You guys should be playing I should be watching you guys play
6789020	6792780	Should I do a stream like that where I commentate over your guys's gameplay on stuff?
6792860	6795740	Like you just submit like a five minute clip and I'll be like, oh, yeah get it
6795820	6797820	Yeah, yeah, yeah

7312700	7317260	Hey, you do have to wait for the NPCs to go through the door because if you go through the door first for some reason
7317260	7319580	They don't show up on the other side unless you want to wait
7320140	7325900	But we need to assist the man through the door. They're there. There you go into the yep into the court

7351500	7358860	I saw a clip of someone taking someone's ship and someone was like they just stole his in real life money or something
7359980	7361980	Because he took a ship that was in game
7363020	7365180	I don't know what's going on with starcraft citizens
7365260	7368060	But I hope you guys are doing okay out there because I don't I don't

7409340	7412620	Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, baby

7474140	7476380	Hold on let me check that is retrieved the horn
7477500	7484140	Now we can ignore that and go and do the thieves guild which is much more exciting in my humble opinion
7484460	7490220	So let's go all the way doing this hell and we'll finish this little miscellaneous and then we'll go to the thieves guild
7493420	7496220	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
7496620	7500460	I get so annoyed with these guys because they always end up killing NPCs
7500540	7506220	You need to drag the cultists out of any environment because they always kill NPCs
7506540	7510300	And you can't resurrect the freaking thing. So you need to wait until they come and attack you
7511260	7512780	Get ready
7512780	7514780	Prepare yourself
7519580	7521580	There's so annoying
7522460	7524460	You're no one they call dragonborn
7525660	7530620	Yeah, the great beards. Yes, I am your lies fall on deaf ears deceiver
7531180	7536540	The true dragonborn comes you are but he's shadow. You are but he's shadow

7543580	7546140	Right, right Lydia Lydia
7547340	7550060	Please do not kill any of the guards. I'm gonna be so annoyed
7551740	7553740	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah perish
7554060	7555900	super
7555900	7559260	Okay, Lydia got smacked up, but she's okay. That's good
7559820	7566220	We'll take that. Oh, well, what do you can add destroy? Oh, I can destroy these for a level up
7566780	7570300	Oh, I'll take that. I'll take that. Oh, look at that. I'll take that
7574220	7579660	Yes, I um dragonborn actually funny you mentioned that in passing. Yeah, I'm actually the dragonborn the one you
7579820	7582620	You're the hey. Yeah, we got the DLCs too. Whoa
7583980	7585500	I don't want to
7585500	7587500	What time is it? Oh wake up
7589260	7592700	Wake up. Oh my that actually really hurt my hands. I don't know if you heard me
7592940	7595500	Smack my bone on the table to try and make that noise
7597260	7601820	Is this a fresh run it is we're just gonna be doing the best quests
7602700	7607180	Which is the main quest and thieves guild and then because I completely
7607580	7610220	Messed it up like a dum-dum-dummy-dum-dum-dum
7610860	7616940	Ah, good to see you. I delivered the supplies. Wasn't it? It was anyway much appreciated
7617420	7620140	Here take this for your troubles. Thank you
7621260	7627900	Uh, oh, I got 500 coin. Honestly, that's decent. We're gonna pick up ninroot because I'm pretty sure there's a ninroot quest at a later date
7628380	7630380	Uh, right. We're gonna check the map
7630860	7633500	Uh, and we're gonna go directly east
7634460	7636460	Because that is where
7637180	7639180	DLC 2
7640700	7643260	Oh my god cute fragile girl, bro
7643420	7646940	I could hardly open those freaking cans of fizzy juice yesterday
7646940	7650220	I was actually getting embarrassed and then I couldn't even open up the kisses either
7650780	7656700	I was like freaking straining for my life. Thankfully my my sweaty hands came in clutch when it came to the crisps
7657420	7660700	Uh, oh, excuse me. Just going for a swim casually. I'm
7661660	7668140	Uh, 500 quid is like literally so good honestly. That's like such a big booster start in the game
7669900	7671260	Uh, right
7671260	7673740	Redmond's hall. I don't like the sound of that
7674460	7678620	Hey, we are just gonna try and discover the landmarks on the way. Oh wait, we can can we just use our
7679180	7681660	Okay, we can just use our ultimate to get a bit faster
7682700	7684700	The cultist are from myriac still see
7685260	7688780	I don't like that one. We can maybe do vampire quest lane as well
7689740	7696060	Vampire thieves guild and main quests where the storm cloaks win in the end. Yes, please
7696540	7699980	I think I will be very satisfied with their Skyrim adventures doing that
7700860	7702860	I'm clear cut and we're not kind of
7703660	7705660	Stuck on the hill. Come on. There we go. Uh
7707340	7709340	That definitely because
7709340	7713580	They're freaking actually that's another thing. Uh, Todd. Why make
7714300	7720060	Serena in the first place if I can't marry her like I'm not being funny, but probably one of the best characters
7721100	7724300	Please leave me alone. I don't want any trouble. Okay. I'm just passing through
7725100	7726700	um
7726700	7728940	But there's done their amazing side quest honestly
7729900	7733740	You should always pick ninroot. It's the only plant that is limited in the game. Oh
7734620	7741340	Are you gonna do the assassin guys quest the dark brotherhood? Actually, I really enjoy the dark brotherhood. We might end up doing that as well
7742300	7749340	Was it sweet mother sweet mother send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear
7749420	7751980	I remember watching that for the first time
7752620	7757900	And just being blown away like I loved everything about uh
7759420	7764300	I'm going to such a such an edgy little child such an edgy little beast
7765660	7767260	um
7767260	7772380	Todd didn't want players to have too much fun and they couldn't keep buying the new versions of Skyrim honestly
7773580	7780380	Uh, there is a forest ahead. I think after the forest is uh, oh look at the rabbit. Goodbye
7781820	7785980	Oh, I made a noise. I actually feel bad now. I'm not doing that again
7786620	7791660	If it didn't make a noise, I'd be all right. But because it made a noise. I actually generally feel really bad
7792940	7794940	Just a bit
7795260	7800780	You know that vampire woman sara. I think that's her name. She can become human serena
7802860	7805420	Why am I so high up? Where am I?
7807580	7813340	Oh, I'm on the freaking outskirts of the map rifting here, right? That'll be why I can't go any higher
7813740	7815980	But I can go higher. Why can I go higher?
7820140	7821820	Right
7821820	7823820	What?
7824540	7826540	Wait, there's a pair. Oh, that's Lydia
7827100	7830540	I was like, why is there NPCs like all the way up here? Where are they?
7831420	7834780	What why is this wait? There's like a genuinely a path here though
7836380	7838780	I'm looking crazy. Have I even been here before?
7843580	7848380	Whoa, okay, we've got hunters. That's fine. Oh, there's a dragon thing up ahead
7848380	7855660	There's like way more south side. It looks like the end. Good hunt
7878380	7880380	Oh
7881900	7883900	I'm in a trance right now. I'm so sorry
7901100	7903980	Where am I genuinely what?
7904940	7906940	Oh
7907260	7909260	Don't do that
7909580	7916700	Oh, there's rifting. Okay. I was getting so confused. I've literally just came the most difficult way possible
7918300	7923660	I was getting so confused. I'm like, I could have sworn rifting was east southeast
7924380	7929500	I literally isn't I can't believe I just did that. I almost just flew myself off that
7929980	7934460	Oh, this is the scooma then. Oh, I love this quest so much
7938540	7940540	Okay
7940620	7946220	Again book is worth 50. So we got a level up. Uh, she be cotton bum is live right now
7946300	7949100	If you're sick of Todd Howard winning again
7949740	7951740	Uh, yeah, okay, dummy
7952620	7954620	That is an elk. No, it's a wool
7955340	7957340	Oh
7958860	7963580	Gone the most difficult way yet. It's literally the horse is currently
7964220	7965980	um
7965980	7971660	Vertical on the mountainside type of pathing because that I couldn't have made it any worse if I tried
7974620	7980140	Trying to do some scooma. Oh my god, would you do scooma with me at the next convention?
7980700	7985980	Have the next feature reconvention list of scooma. I don't even know what it's supposed to do or mimic
7986380	7989980	I guess supposed to maybe mimic um barrel bine
7991340	7993340	um
7994780	7998540	Yeah, because everyone seems zonked out barrel bine makes you very, um
8000540	8002540	Sedated in nature. We're
8003660	8005340	Right rifting
8005340	8007340	There's a wolf below me again
8008220	8013740	I'm just decimating the wolf population. Honestly skyrim's just scotland before they eradicated the world
8013740	8017340	She can't convince me otherwise like right. I'm pretty sure
8018780	8022780	If we discover. Yeah, this is the first, um thieves thing

8123580	8129260	Before I let you in to rift. Yeah. Yeah visitors tax. How about we do a little persuasion
8129820	8134060	For the privilege of entering the city. This is obviously a shake down
8135340	8140700	Keep your boys down my speeches 22. I don't know about you
8141580	8143580	My speeches
8145180	8149180	I had another there she is. This is the person I normally wife
8149420	8153820	But then again, I've become the head of the thieves guild and she absolutely despises it
8155180	8157180	You're not from rifting
8158620	8160620	My travels have taken me from high
8162220	8168700	Morrowind at all points in between. Why are you here then many years ago? I lost my you and I I see
8169020	8171020	Grimm's weeper so with
8171020	8172780	um
8172780	8174780	Oh, this guy shakes his down as well
8175340	8180620	Looking for trouble. Um, I'm I'm just passing. I'm not scared of you
8181100	8183100	That's the wrong answer
8183340	8188620	Last thing the black briars need around here is some troublemaker trying to steal a piece of the action
8189660	8194860	Who are the black briars have ripped it in their pocket and the thieves guild watching their back
8195260	8198140	So keep your nose out of their business. Why are you telling me all this for free?
8198700	8205740	I'm maul. I watch the streets for them if you need dirt on anything. I'm your guy, but it'll cost you
8206860	8211980	You're just begging for a pagan aren't you? I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that and then you're stupider
8214060	8216060	My persuasion check failed
8217340	8218620	eat
8218620	8220220	Eat
8220220	8223260	I'm really getting tired of your excuses. Yeah, like everyone
8224700	8227500	Uh, it's like, okay. This is the start
8229100	8233180	But everyone wants to talk to you at once when you enter rift and I have to admit
8233260	8239580	It's a bit of a sensory bit of a cheeky sensory overload entering in your city in skyrim. Everyone wants to talk to you
8241420	8246620	Right, uh, how could you possibly know that that I'm a thief the way they want
8247180	8250620	Right, I'm going to tell you something you should absolutely not do
8251260	8256780	Maybe you'd like a taste the game is going to ask you to plan a ring on this person
8257340	8259980	And it locks him up in jail and removes
8260460	8264140	Um, a cellar from rifting don't do it
8266460	8268460	Don't do it. Okay
8269020	8273660	If you do it, it removes him as a cellar and it's like another 800 coins
8273660	8279260	You can't get from selling stuff these symbols you see around the city. Um, these are thieves guild symbols
8279260	8280780	You'll see them everywhere
8280780	8286380	It means this place has been marked or there's something of value inside like you'll see the symbols everywhere
8286700	8291900	Um, you always want to fail this quest. It doesn't matter if you feel that you still get to become a part of the thieves guild
8292620	8294620	and
8295420	8299500	Oh, he's not started his dialogue clearly because uh, that should have done it

8312860	8318460	Oh freaking the sake I have to let the dialogue actually run out. Um

10266380	10277540	tell us to go do a quest where we manipulate and a competitor to her brewery and which is quite
10277540	10284980	a unique one because of what goes on inside the quest quick question is our way to get into the
10284980	10292020	these girl treasury not that I know of and other than doing the quest line where it opens up and
10292020	10303820	then it reveals and then it were the big root wait what oh it's been reefing seed for honestly
10303820	10318700	should I call a break should we do it wait hold on me let me finish my war oh that was
10318700	10324540	top water yeah I don't really find a top war yeah when I have it in tea I guess it covers up all
10324540	10332780	the flavor I work with my mother to sell first time vegetable that anyone are you okay I know it's
10332780	10336100	scary I know it's scary to go into a new place for the first time but you'll be all right hand
10336100	10348180	the new buddy oh my gosh I love it I love this game so much I'm a hello hello hello
10348180	10356380	can't a man drink in peace geez you looks his eyes are gone like I shadow on I'm gonna keep this
10357340	10365660	owner so we're to basically poison the bat from a meadery in order to get this guy arrested
10365660	10375420	it's pretty pretty yeah it's pretty deep plot I have to admit the plot is so deep like it's
10375420	10387180	probably I'd say an average of five inches deep of this plot and I will make a tea and get some
10387180	10390180	food in me because I think I'm starting to go slightly delirious because I've not had anything
10390180	10395660	I'm supposed to be holding a tasting at the new hunting so if he sees the meadery in this state
10395660	10405020	there's currently skevers and at his meteorite and we're gonna offer well that's not how I operate
10405500	10414300	you better or I'll yell skeever okay okay no need to make rash decisions here's half my only demand
10414300	10421100	is that these are permanent so he is literally handing us the poison that we're gonna poison
10421100	10431580	the bat of mead with it's it's it's so evil I love it please eat get that nutrition you
10432460	10441580	I just get so distracted when I stream like I don't oh fucking hell um I just uh oh sorry sorry
10441580	10449100	um it's all about pear shaped hasn't it uh yeah I just like kind of forget to eat and stuff when I
10449100	10454220	stream I just get so distracted because it's like such a good time I've always been like oh my gosh
10454220	10467500	oh all right oh this is things beating me up I'm literally like I'm on the red oh you can't even
10467500	10473980	see my health bar oh wow my health bar is really bad right now uh I'll show you how bad it is I can
10473980	10480780	I can heal right now that's how bad it oh maybe I need to adjust my chat so it doesn't go over the
10480860	10487740	screen especially for video games like this I might get that change
10490380	10496460	uh speaking the honeybrew mead with emmy needs honestly emmy needs delightfully
10497340	10503100	emmy would cry for him it's not bad you're no hit legendary um
10507420	10509660	hold on Lydia you Lydia
10511900	10518060	Lydia you literally went around the way what do you mean by over the screen so you see how like
10518060	10524620	next to me is that little cuttlefish to my to your left I guess from your paw see how the chat is
10524620	10530060	like going up on screen from that chat box I might change it so it doesn't so the video game isn't
10530780	10535420	like encroached in any way because I just noticed now that you can't see my health bar
10536140	10543580	um you can see my stamina constantly but my big hairs oh oh sorry there's traps sorry sorry oh
10543580	10549660	sorry sorry oh oh Lydia Lydia there's traps like did you not just hear me jump over them Lydia
10549980	10558860	oh right this fight always scares me because this guy is actually super OP for no reason
10558860	10565020	there's a man in here oh we need to we need to get him first because I have like no magic oh
10565020	10573820	bruv bruv hold on all right I'll get the rats first he is like so strong for no reason and
10573820	10578780	he freaking does that where he fucking backs off I hate when you back off when you're fighting them
10578860	10584140	like I know that's normal to back off when someone's like coming at you but like it's so annoying just
10584140	10589100	stand still and let me parachute it's like not that big a deal yeah so that man was currently
10589100	10597180	living with the the skevers um you know as long as he's happy and thriving that's the main thing but
10600940	10605340	no a little to the right no no a little to the left a bit more
10606300	10608140	no a little bit more to the left
10611580	10614620	he's a mage yeah we hate mages honestly there's so annoying
10618060	10625420	male version of imme oh I mean ow I keep getting wrecked by these traps like I've like forgotten them
10625420	10631260	all right we'll finish this quest and then I will get some food in me because I'm probably moments
10631340	10637180	from perishing uh you can just grab this key back here by the way super easy um I totally
10637180	10641980	didn't know that on my first playthrough and walked all the way back uh like a dumb dumb
10643020	10647820	I don't want to steal from it it's honestly kind of picking up stolen items is really annoying
10647820	10654140	if the guards end up picking you up right we've done it we've done the quest once we finish we'll
10654140	10660620	take a look if you need to sample some of the finest meat in skyline that your shift hasn't even
10660620	10668220	started yet when I'm hello well it's about time I you'll just have to wait until after the camp
10668220	10673500	right we're gonna watch it all we're gonna watch it all in furl lydia go take a seat there
10673740	10678300	lydia go sit lydia sit

10701260	10707740	the elton ring dlc yeah we you word when it comes out we're replaying the full game again
10707740	10714540	and the dlc on top I have no idea how big the dlc is it's probably gonna be a week of elton ring
10714540	10720220	so I do apologize to anyone who hates elton ring I will probably have like a shorter stream and
10720220	10728540	maybe do like a membership stream as well and switch it up maybe she doesn't like to be told
10728620	10731500	sit she's not a good girl bad girl

11020700	11024780	don't get me wrong you could scam a beggar how about I recite the work even more
11026540	11031980	I reduce the work even more and chew it for me do you know that's how um used to food
11031980	11037340	babies back in the day um it's actually really common for the moms to chew the food and then
11037420	11039340	give it to the um
11042700	11049580	um yeah so like before baby formula was a thing and like solid food training or whatever like
11049580	11055020	before the kind of capitalism market kind of exploded went until you hear about what nesli did um
11056700	11060780	yeah it was like really common your mom chews the food for you and then gives it to you in your
11060780	11064780	mouth it's like a little baby birth moment and everyone's like that's so gross and I was like
11064780	11070220	bro that's the way it is that's just like how have it be you know it's very interesting I actually
11070220	11074620	could probably write an entire video I see about it and then present that video I say live on stream
11074620	11079260	and just to show everyone how natural things are but everything's been so like oh they're so weird
11079260	11083500	but it's only weird because we've not been exposed to it and we no longer even talk about it because
11083500	11088140	it's like literally unironically been bred out of us over a few generations because capitalism is away
11089100	11095340	um what one fun world scrawny did you consider getting mana as backup food
11097580	11106140	yeah mummy burden literally I didn't know that was a thing it is so um uh babies newborns should
11106140	11111660	start on breast milk because it's full of colostrum um and it's also because a baby doesn't actually
11111660	11116620	have an immune system until six months old um so it's very important to have breast milk however
11116940	11122540	it was very common to have what's called a wet nurse which is when um a woman who had recently
11122540	11127660	had a child would share and because it's very common for some women to experience a surplus and
11127660	11134620	it's very common for some women to experience problems producing milk it's just kind of random
11134620	11139100	doesn't really there's a lot of factors that come into play um obviously stress is a major one
11139100	11145660	stress on any human body for a long period do you mind I'm telling you a story about titty milk
11146860	11152700	leave me alone um but yes I'm sure as a lot of you can imagine being stressed for a very long
11152700	11161020	time is very bad for your health um guys uh guys uh stress manifests in a lot of mental health issues
11161020	11172220	and a lot of loneliness um oh are we gonna make it you know what we're gonna send it send it right
11172220	11176540	hold on hold on let them fake them out a little fake them out fake them out fake them out it's fine
11177820	11185580	wow wait wrong one oh shit I'm out of stamina and he's like right next to me this is rather
11185580	11191740	embarrassing I have to admit uh I didn't really think this far through yeah stress got me pretty good
11191740	11197820	yeah I like it here because I learned so much information okay there we go we can get away
11198780	11204620	we're I hear it I don't see it I think that's good that I don't see it though because it means
11204620	11210220	it's not near me don't call me out like that yeah it's very um interest in the way it physically
11210220	11214700	manifests in the way like obviously I think the majority of us have been like raised in a western
11214700	11220060	society which obviously comes with a lot of socialization and socialization plays so much
11220060	11226620	into the how you can deal with stress factors and like it's just kind of a sad fact that like
11226700	11233020	homeboys uh kind of get told to suck it up um like I can literally go green to the girls right now
11233020	11238380	and it's like nothing's wrong with it or anything um but it's very interesting how you tackle it I
11238380	11242860	don't even know how you tackle it I wouldn't even have a clue where you start like the only thing I
11242860	11249340	guess you could hope for is pockets of communities and overtime ideas get popular like um when the
11249340	11255260	general consensus of society changes that's when the real change comes through but the problem is
11255260	11261340	you have to basically go out with the old and how do you go out with the old well the old passes
11261340	11268780	away the old doesn't bring down bring down the old doesn't pass on its teachings like for example um
11269660	11275740	I like my grandparents talked about how they got hit by their parents and it was very common
11275740	11280860	place to be hit if you didn't know it's actually illegal to punish your child via a corporal
11280860	11286460	punishment yes your own child in Scotland is legal and you will be prosecuted for hitting them no it
11286460	11292300	is not punishment no it is not spanking no it is literally against the law you're welcome to go up and
11292300	11302540	it's very bad for the child there's a lot of things done around it um but it's very fascinating um how
11302540	11306860	quickly things can change within a generation so my grandparents told me stories about them
11306860	11313740	getting hit by their parents they did not hit my parents like they didn't hit mom and dad and then
11313740	11321580	you know opposites I didn't hit mom and dad and mom or dad so my mom spanked me so my dad never
11321580	11326140	hit me he doesn't like it he doesn't believe in it and he absolutely despises it my mom
11328380	11333260	so there was this orange slipper and she used to hit me with it all the time because it's such a
11333660	11344700	child um but it's very interesting because um within a couple of generations in Scotland
11345260	11351260	it's a big no no to discipline your children via punishment like that physical punishment um and
11351260	11355820	it's just like interesting to see as the generations come and go like some people might not like the
11355820	11361500	emphasis like oh if you're in this age range you're gen X if you're in this you're a zoomer you're this
11361580	11369260	you're that but the reason it is so purposeful and so important to have these names for generations
11369260	11380140	is because there's also a lot of societal behaviors that emerge I hear Ninroop I hear it yes um and
11381180	11388220	uh so like you who are listening to me right now odds are we were not raised in the exact same
11388220	11397340	society with the expectations and whatever's however we are crazy enough to have the ability
11397340	11406620	to set up a community like mind where we might agree on how things like should go and how things
11406620	11418540	shouldn't go and we have created a pocket a pocket of a collective that can provide secondary
11418540	11425100	socialization which is crazy because primary socialization is your parents but secondary is
11425100	11430540	like outside outside influence and I could influence you to see the world differently
11430540	11436940	through my words which is like insane um even we might not even be in the same generation and it's
11436940	11442140	just as freaking socialization is fantastic stuff I will also probably write a massive stream essay
11442140	11447340	I would love to talk about all this stuff in higher detail but right now we're about to do the thieves
11447340	11453340	quest and I've forgotten again to get food but that's okay we're just gonna sneak on in

11548860	11554060	did I tell you that whenever I make it I guess like forbidden knowledge whenever I make an audio
11554060	11563740	where I'm very our word um people really enjoy that so I just let you should know it seems to be a
11563740	11570060	thing though that like anyway I'm literally standing up swiveling on my chair I will be back uh give me

12318620	12324780	i'm not i don't actually i think that hands are the average size for a waman i thought i'm
12324780	12331020	being funny i actually thought i was like bang on average for everything but i guess i'm not and
12331020	12338460	i'm actually on the smaller side they are tiny okay like when i got the ruler oh sorry i just
12338460	12342460	punched the microphone uh when i got the ruler i thought that was really fun because everyone can
12342460	12349900	kind of um wasd is natural hand position yeah i definitely agree with that
12355740	12360540	god you have no idea how badly i want to hold my hands i should come to our convention then
12361820	12366700	i have uh i'll get a bodyguard just you know just to make sure everything's all above ground

12373500	12378860	comes to a convention to come see you like i like the idol meetings like the japanese idol
12378860	12382620	meetings where they like hold your hand and you can like talk and look at each other like over
12382620	12387900	the table type thing i think that's really sweet and cute but i don't know i don't know it just seems

12398780	12408220	entertain me to do that that's honestly ridiculous make sure everything's above the table honestly
12410060	12413340	who would get in trouble first me or you me or are we fun
12418860	12425420	let me analyze this one hey stroney is there any chance for hypnosis with helping the listener
12425420	12432140	with addiction or focusing desires upon yourself from distractions um
12434700	12441180	oh i'm not sure i can do stuff like that mine is always of an alternative nature for
12441980	12453820	grat of the defying nature um i absolutely am not qualified or capable or doing anything that
12454300	12461820	um kind of has like a i don't know what the word is but like i
12464220	12469980	therapeutic yeah i would say there is any therapeutic hypnosis i can't participate in
12469980	12477180	because i don't actually have the knowledge on how who goes there how to do it safely so uh
12477180	12483820	safety first i will admit this is out of my league i am definitely not there and i don't
12483820	12489420	think i ever will be there um 10 out of 10 i know 10 holy moly oh yeah oh did you forget when i eat

13279660	13286220	for you i'm devoted to you i really want to send you something but i haven't had the inspiration
13286220	13292780	been really in my my emotions lately and it's really slammed my libido do i know a sad fact
13292780	13300220	my alternative picture is the last time rip in the chat i've been so freaking stressed
13300220	13308700	like all the time and i can't like unstress myself i think it'll calm down like once the
13308780	13312700	things settle but like i'm so freaking stressed and it's such a shame
13320220	13326780	but i'm sure i will get inspiration soon tm i think maybe i'll tell you what i think maybe
13326780	13332860	once the monetization for everyone has been achieved i'll start to feel relaxed because like then
13332860	13337020	truly is up to the girls whatever they want to do and i can just get fun shorts ordered of them
13337740	13343100	but like right now i'm like oh my god there's four out of six why is the other two not come
13343100	13346940	through because we applied for them all at the same time like oh no weapons if one of the girls
13346940	13351980	don't get youtube monetization oh no that that's like a whole month and uh just like oh i don't
13351980	13356380	oh i would be sick if i think about it we pretend we do not see
13356380	13368700	but yeah the the what did i say there's a line of volunteers is extremely long thank
13369740	13371580	yeah you guys want to make gentry right now
13378460	13383820	i've almost finished eating and then i will slurp my honey tea and then we'll get back into the
13383820	13394620	thieves guild
13396540	13404460	skyrim's going good we're at um golem from the thieves guild quest we're about to be
13405260	13412060	meeting the big naughty on who's trying to take down the thieves guild soon tm and um
13412940	13419260	once we do the thieves guild we are going to do the dark brotherhood because i actually really
13419260	13424940	enjoy it it's quite i think i think the dark brotherhood is actually relatively quick um
13426860	13430540	and then we're going to do the vampires and then if we still have time we're going to do
13431420	13438620	um the actual dragonborn quest line which i hate doing because it breaks the game and
13438700	13443180	then if you ever like seriously want to do like a hundred percent speed run it's speed
13443180	13446860	runs not speed run just a hundred percent achievements always leave it last because
13446860	13453980	it breaks the game so much when you have to like say like oh we'll give white run up or we'll give
13453980	13460460	this uh rifting off or we'll do this or we'll do that every day feel as how much it breaks the game
13460460	13472460	but i finished my my bowl of lasagna um now i've got my my cup of tea and my cola i do i do
13472460	13478300	i've got my cola no need to read this during a stream oh yeah what happens if i do it right now
13479260	13484460	the ASMR stream was amazing strongy i was putting your hands during it
13485020	13487020	ah that's so cute
13494780	13499500	oh whoa someone is giving me a step by step
13501260	13505500	gate on how to do haptic feedback
13505500	13516060	penalize penalizing okay that's the law links um how down bad do you think is too down bad for
13516060	13526220	you for me oh no i like i like main corruption so there's not really a down too bad i think
13526220	13532860	corruption's really um up there um oh my first membership stream can be about that
13533100	13535980	uh no about ranking everything
13541980	13543740	penalize yes
13545580	13552540	aw strongy i just want to thank you for giving all the girls a home and a family
13552540	13557020	veal are such a positive part of the environment already and i'm happy to watch along with all
13557100	13562940	the other reeflings oh reeflin i said also the latest patreon post is incredible
13563820	13569100	did you like it i thought it was good would you let me pick on your party
13571580	13577580	uh yes if you are a patreon member um another audio has gone up so there's a total of three
13577580	13584780	audios up um it is spaced out for the other girls so because all the audios were uploaded on the first
13584780	13590220	that did mean there's a bit of a break between the next one that comes up but as it stands everyone
13590220	13604540	has a day if i can remember correctly azura monday mersey tuesday um emmy wednesday sheby thursday
13604540	13618140	i see friday strongy saturday i'm not quite sure but just so you understand they are purposefully
13618140	13630780	spaced out who goes there um and um they will be like every tuesday all of x's will go out on
13630780	13635660	every tuesday all of like for me every saturday an audio will come out like that kind of thing
13635660	13643180	um we i'm going to get the girls to post on what's inside like with the tags and everything
13643820	13651020	i just need catch up time um she says as she's sitting on skyrim for an endurance stream
13651020	13656140	i've got nothing but the cheek i really do i've got nothing but the cheek but i do need catch up
13656140	13664700	time to get into the flow of things then next month um 100 will be like you will see what's
13664700	13670620	inside if you want to subscribe for that month or not and if not then you know you can take a look
13670620	13676060	at whoever else is posting maybe they've got something a bit more up to your style again i would
13676060	13683420	like to repeat when it comes to the audios i have not shoehorned anyone into the same type of plot
13683500	13689260	if you will because that will not financially enable them to be the content creator they'd
13689260	13694380	like to be um a lot of the girls are looking at moving out possibly if they're able to receive
13694380	13699500	enough support so that's why i do say if you only have enough money to support one girl please do
13699500	13708860	pick a daughter of mine because um they are gunning to move out um and it means they would
13708860	13719900	provide more content and yeah it's just a very positive cycle occurs um yes uh yeah i'm both
13719900	13726220	meanies like not bad to kill it by emoji if you subscribe to everyone you get an audio every day
13726220	13731740	i mean technically you're very close you get a rest day no one uploads on a sunday
13732140	13739180	also they deserve it yes the girls work incredibly hard um ac was like am i allowed
13739180	13744140	someone asked a question to ac on marshmallow like uh how do your recordings work and she was
13744140	13749100	like am i allowed to talk about this and i'm like yeah you can as long as you don't see anything
13749100	13755100	that's like nda obvious then yeah you can talk about how i i burst into your dms and hand you a
13755100	13760140	script and all the spelling is wrong and the grammar's whack yeah you can talk about that all
13760140	13772460	you like i say actual day of rest honestly um but yes thank you for thanking me for giving the girls
13772460	13778860	a home but please understand the girls did it themselves they reached out to vealer they applied
13778860	13783980	um they went to an interview and they were happy with everything some of them did the very thorough
13783980	13791180	research uh emi actually was the most inquisitive and had the most questions azura i think she was
13791180	13796220	just like is any of this real i think she thought she was dreaming because she never asked a single
13796220	13804220	question after the interview um yeah azura was absolutely adorable emi asked a ton of questions
13804220	13808780	which made me think she wasn't actually gonna accept the character because i told her what the
13808780	13816540	character theme was and i saw people were being weird but yeah azura was like fuck it we ball
13816540	13823500	indian and docs and notwithstanding they have carte blanche what carte blanche
13824300	13833820	but what uh in english what in english english that's so azura honestly yeah that sounds like
13834780	13844380	big mommy we ball honestly a free pass or it means like free reign oh carte blanche a blank
13844940	13852700	menu is what the translation is that makes sense a free pass a blank menu oh my god i can't believe
13852700	13862300	it sorry i translated it literally versus uh metaphor good uh hi sending messages scares me

13993420	13999500	do my monetization celebration stream where everyone can absolutely laugh and i'm pretty sure

14024060	14031180	ear cleaning i've not had a medical ear cleaning but i did get my hearing checked as a child um
14031180	14037740	because i was ignoring my mum where i was undiagnosed it was my idea actually um
14040380	14042780	i'm going to sip my tea before it gets too cold okay
14043740	14052140	eh yeah my mum got me uh sent to a hearing test because she was sitting at my dad she was like
14052140	14057580	strony doesn't he listen to me like strony strony never hears me and i used to do this thing
14057580	14063740	where i sat right in front of the tv so the tv was on a stand but i would sit directly under it so
14063740	14068780	my neck was looking directly upward sorry i just hit the mic there by uh i know you can't see my
14068780	14075100	hands but my mic was at my mic my neck was directly upwards looking at the tv like pure pure
14075100	14081740	in a trance like straight up like tizm a doctor walked in and tizm was the diagnosis type thing
14082380	14088380	and obviously my mum didn't know what it was all about at the time so i got sent for a hearing test
14088380	14094700	and she was like the wife that did the hearing test on me she was like oh no pet you're hearing
14094700	14101660	spain i don't know what's going on with you um and yeah basically that was that's when the
14101660	14108220	signs start to show and then now here i am someone who has to read and write for a living and goodness
14108220	14115580	gravey is it freaking hard i'm slurping is she okay nah she's just fucking hella autistic
14115580	14125820	a kid with autism how close were you to the tv oh i'm not being funny when i'm like i was directly
14125820	14134140	below the tv i like i was sitting crisscross looking directly up at the tv and my neck was
14134140	14144060	up in the air like it and i and my mum ascertained that it was hearing issues rather than something
14144060	14150300	else maybe going on she had a case of strontism honestly the strontism's too strong
14153420	14158700	um that's not good for your eyes oh well i do actually need to be wearing my glicks but
14160460	14166060	i'm making it work okay i was right in the vtuber collab scripts and i was like this is too small
14166060	14171260	this text so i zoomed in and i'm like oh my god i'm gonna be a blind as a fish like really soon
14171260	14173900	wait that's literally me as a kid literally
14178700	14186540	do you reckon cuttlefish have actual autism um as an uncertified marine biologist anything is
14186540	14191820	possible if you didn't know down syndrome is possible in animals as well um i believe down
14191820	14200940	syndrome is the deletion of chrome zone oh god what is it in humans uh not 32 that's
14201740	14205260	not right i can't remember which deletion it is but it can happen in gorillas
14205260	14209740	seriously i'm not even kidding look up down some down syndrome gorilla and like it's
14209740	14216060	fucking creepy oh it's an extra edition of 21 sorry yeah i'm thinking of the deletion one
14216060	14221340	what is the deletion one called that i always watch documentaries about
14223180	14228860	it happens when life deletes 32 yes um actually spindle fiber failure um
14231180	14237180	uh which is i um i find it really interesting oh god i feel like every time i'm like i find
14237180	14242380	this so interesting and fascinating it leads to me rambling about something that you guys couldn't
14242380	14248300	give less of a shit about i feel really bad but at the same time i really like blabbing away so i'm
14248300	14255820	like that just do it that just tell you about um fertilization so the reason why the rate of down
14255820	14263500	syndrome goes up dramatically the older the woman is beyond the age of 25 yes the age of 25 um
14264220	14270940	you're you're already hitting the wall at 25 rip um the reason it goes up exponentially is because
14271020	14279660	the failure of the spindle fibers that's what pulls apart um that's what pulls it apart and then
14279660	14286060	results in a the an additional chromosome wiggling about which is the rise of down syndrome which is
14286060	14295180	why women who um are having children later in life are often advised to do what is uh referred to
14296140	14302940	as a DNA test which i've completely forgotten the name of but basically they pierce the amniotic
14302940	14309100	sac and take a tiny cell sample of the baby and then check its DNA sequence under um you know get
14309100	14313020	it because to see if the child has down syndrome or not and then either they're advised would you
14313020	14318780	like to terminate or not or bring to term whatever type thing goes on but um it definitely is a risk
14318780	14324700	and uh like also being obese with the child as well results in gestational diabetes which is
14324700	14334540	very dangerous for the child very dangerous for the mum um there's also um if depending on the blood
14334540	14340780	type of the mother and the blood type of the child the mother during the entire pregnancy her body can
14340780	14347740	be attacking the baby until it um has a natural um abortion if you didn't know abortion is the
14347740	14354620	natural term but you can also get a medical abortion but abortion is the natural term for
14354620	14359820	it just happening and there are many reasons why it can never come to term how do you know all this
14359820	14366780	stuff is fascinating no i don't go to school i like watching youtube videos about um biology related
14366780	14374060	things i have a fascination in uh diagnoses in particular like why the reason it occurs for
14374060	14382780	example um like uh there's this syndrome uh of course it evades my mind i think it's called
14382780	14389660	like william hunter syndrome where the child or the well the child that can become an adult um
14389660	14394860	because you you do not pass away uh unless you have complications with other diseases for example
14394860	14401500	um you will never experience the sensation of being full uh you will constantly eat um there's
14401500	14408700	like hereditary syndromes as well like hunter syndrome which is pretty uh devastating um there's
14408700	14415660	interesting one such as dwarfism dwarfism can actually be passed on by two individuals who
14415660	14426140	visually do not have any um display of any dwarf uh ism genetics um but it is a recessive gene uh
14426140	14430380	and if the two people come together um yep you can have it how do you know all this
14430380	14436540	reefling that obviously has not got the autism angel man syndrome is that angel man syndrome
14437660	14446620	is that the one where the child is locked in the child like say i believe so mentally they
14446620	14455740	can't develop any further um uh yes uh Harley Quinn syndrome um doesn't sound like what it is
14455820	14461260	it's where your skin constantly your skin regenerates so fast that you flake and you break and it's
14461260	14468140	just absolute it is a living heck for those poor uh like children that are born but you can make it
14468140	14476060	to adulthood um there's a lot of sad um diagnoses that you can get like you can get childhood
14476060	14482380	dementia those are quite crushing ones um stroneys institute for the gift to take
14482860	14487100	you up angel man is the eaten one is it Harley Quinn issues yeah
14488940	14495900	as door is dwarfism classified only is being short there are a redonkulous amount of dwarfism
14495900	14503420	classifications um some can be like no stunted growth on the abdomen uh other versions are no
14503420	14511660	stunted growth on the arms and the legs but the um organ holder area if you will for lack of better
14511660	14516860	words abdomen all that and chest and that like there's so many different classifications is quite um
14519100	14523580	it's quite fascinating stuff when she uh get into torso yeah torso will do just nicely
14523580	14528220	i remember when the photos of those babies were used as shock foot yeah unfortunately um
14530220	14536940	kind of if you use older like if you look up like Freud stuff for example you get quite a
14536940	14542220	few older photos that are like Freud Freud you didn't have to photograph that mate like you know
14543260	14548940	do you know about prisons yeah like the stanley prison experiment and how people play roles that
14548940	14555500	they perceive to be superior uh absolutely fascinating stuff i do and enjoy the psychology
14555500	14565740	it has to offer um i think humans and our everyday socialization were always kind of
14566300	14573500	it's always insinuated that there's someone to look up to but i am a big believer in the three
14574540	14581660	um three perspective talk and it's like parent to parent child to child adult to parent or
14581660	14587740	something like that and it's like the three ways you can communicate with someone he said prions
14587740	14596380	oh not prisons my apology i was talking about the the stanley prison experiment prions uh no a
14596380	14601820	little bit about prions not not not too much sorry i just read what i wanted to read prudder's
14601820	14606860	williams syndrome oh prudder willie syndrome that sounds like um i'll just mix them up yes
14606860	14613420	prions diseases are horrifying um did you know about the family of blue people from generations of
14614940	14620700	i know there's a family that's like on youtube because someone goes and films them
14620700	14627340	and they communicate via barks because they have so many issues it's such a shame
14628300	14634540	i want this woman to yank me for the rest of my life honestly
14636620	14643180	uh well that speaking of prions um what is it rabid rickin bites you what's that called
14644380	14653660	as soon as you develop um water phobia water phobia hydrophobic water phobia once you develop
14653660	14660780	hydrophobia rabies that's it once you develop hydrophobia you have a hundred percent um loss rate
14661500	14668460	you can't win it is it is some scary stuff and and to think that we are very lucky to avoid this
14668460	14674300	by getting a simple tetanus shot um it turns out in test was not Winston are you squiddling
14674300	14680860	me right now i'm not i'm sorry for the interruption no no on side note strani teacher outfit when

15081020	15083020	are
15090780	15091660	wait is this not it
15093900	15098780	eh wait what how come crazy is this not it
15099100	15101100	oh
15106620	15114300	hello oh my god i've gone way too far ahead of the plot i've gone way too far ahead of the
15114300	15120220	plot i've not even spoken to the guy to get him to move i was so confused why the trap door
15120220	15127660	wasn't open up oh azura gets you to clean out her star right you're done i'm not not you're done
15128780	15133580	didn't even get to the the first message i read in chat after like a couple of minutes of combat
15133580	15142940	that's terrible yeah azura's star is i uh thought it was on i'm literally speedrun the plot i've
15142940	15150140	gone like 10 leagues ahead i do apologize babel is where humanity teamed up to build a tower
15151260	15154460	to heaven and knocked it down and
15155420	15161100	um honestly it's quite interesting how
15163340	15168460	no i can't say that unfortunately um base i'm speedrunning the plot
15172540	15177020	yeah i've been playing too much binding of isaac oh my god wait have i said i'm
15177020	15181500	i'm like nine eight percent sure i've actually already said this but some of the girls are into
15181980	15189420	tarot cards they're called um and it's the funniest thing ever and the reason why it's
15189420	15195900	funny is my only exposure to tarot cards is the binding of isaac okay which means whenever they're
15195900	15201180	talking about like pool and cards or whatever they're like the tower card and i'm like yes
15201180	15207260	yes six bombs six bombs you can probably unlock like a secret um like a tinted rock and get like
15207260	15212540	a soul heart from it yes and like the lovers yes you can get two hearts if you can find a donation
15212540	15218060	machine maybe you can get some coins out of it i'm like oh goodness sake like all of them must be
15218060	15225180	rolling their eyes that my only experience like the freaking the hanged man uh oh yeah um that's
15225180	15232300	fantastic i can uh i can fly in the room like position or the full card oh yeah it takes me
15232300	15237660	back to the starting of the the map oh that's amazing that's amazing uh hey i'm just gonna
15237660	15244380	skip this part because i don't really need to see it um can you speak a little bit about your
15244380	15249260	plans for membership no bother you shoot before but you're honestly worth it oh my god stop you're
15249260	15257740	gonna make me blush um i will most likely do two memberships uh streams a week um most likely a
15257740	15263340	Samar membership is probably the most requested i also like doing watch alongs um some stream
15263340	15273180	snipe games uh maybe for more close things um maybe i did maybe i i don't care what you promise
15273180	15280620	if i tell you the buyer's name hasn't learned you kill me well i have a body okay it looks like
15280620	15287820	only bribery works on him um two i mean yeah i want to make it worth your money like the way
15287820	15295820	i try to think of it in my head is how much do you pay for like a movie ticket for like one and a
15295820	15302460	half hours entertainment okay i'ma take that and then double it and then double it again so i'm like
15302460	15309420	okay i'll try to stream every single day i'll also try to offer membership streams at least twice a
15309420	15314620	week that seems fair that means in total for the membership not only do you directly support me and
15314620	15321020	future projects gentle and the projects the girls want to pursue soon but we can't talk about any of
15321020	15331660	it yet um and it means like also get like a more i suppose like a more intimate stream experience of
15331660	15341420	people like that um like seventeen dollars for a movie ticket that's outrageous um gen two confirmed
15341420	15346780	live on the stream stocks i remember the first time i did this quest i was so nervous about like
15346780	15354540	all the guards coming at me but they don't even care hanged man to we we hingees well you do
15354540	15359260	watch together streams for members i absolutely would love to do that yes we can a hundred percent
15359340	15365900	do that gen two spoiled live no clickbait oh you just wait until the zers don't a thumb for that
15368460	15372860	if you want to see one of the concepts but not all
15375660	15380700	i don't really talk about it in the server with the girls out of respect because of uh
15381500	15386700	a miscommunication on my part and honestly it's kind of easier it's much easier to go
15387500	15391900	you know oh shit my bad you're right then to like explain in mass detail like what the
15391900	15395420	most communication was you know like it is what it is
15397580	15399900	gen two is just she be with a different voice and a real color
15401660	15408860	i'm actually getting her take this a chocolate skin at some point i'm probably doing it within
15408860	15413900	the next one i brought in the coin and what not at all we're just skipping through the dialogue
15413980	15421340	that can't be our skin into this look now since our transaction is done i love the gen two memes
15421340	15429740	but gen one 3d though um the girls are all very interested in 3d the problem is i don't know
15429740	15439980	i think i'm saying about it i don't have a heart no
15444540	15450380	you should think about staying the night uh wait i know one of those songs but she doesn't sing it
15450380	15456540	it's rodrick rodrick there's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit sure what can i do for you
15456940	15461260	um no there once was a hero named ragnar the rest
15461820	15466460	who came riding to white run from old rodrick stand
15467820	15478460	all this ragged and ragged and brandish his blade as he told the old stories and gold that he made
15478540	15484380	i can't remember the rest i need the rest of it
15486140	15494060	it's in another end i said another end she doesn't go here right we're just gonna if you
15494060	15498620	want to skip this quest literally just time sink and he will teleport because it's just such a
15499740	15504300	whatever way you go about it you know the 3d will be lit yeah i don't have a clue like
15504300	15510860	they maybe had like such a gorgeous 3d model but i'm like 9 in percent sure that shitting
15510860	15519020	vr chat um but i don't know what it is and i'm not sure any of the girls have 3d experience
15519020	15524620	either to help me out the best i can do is like 3d vr chat but i don't know if that's
15524620	15535500	disappointing for them um i will maybe ask sin sin is vr chat i asked her and i was quite happy
15535500	15542140	with her model like um and i think that's like what the girls are if they're one 3d like that's all
15542140	15549660	of god you know um i'll be a learning experience for all vr chat streams being created with you
15549660	15557740	know could you imagine acs dg sessions in pure chat yeah it's it's not necessarily a lot of work
15557740	15564380	because i just oh you can't wait in this location dumb game we're forcing you east empire company
15564380	15574780	warehouse i wonder if that was by the british empire british um so this level you're supposed to
15574780	15589020	like lurk from the sky but yeah i need to offer the girls um what are they called all the trackers
15589740	15595260	but i myself don't actually know what trackers they need and i don't know what the full price
15595260	15599900	point is like i've been really open and honest with the girls and been like obviously once
15599900	15604620	everyone's monetized we can see what kind of money you're earning and if it's good it's bad
15604700	15609020	like because obviously if the girls money's low they're not going to want to stick around are they
15609020	15618700	um so i do have some kind of like mildly boosting efforts but it's not really
15620780	15627420	yeah you know it's kind of when you're on the managing side it's kind of like i can only do
15627420	15632460	so much with what the girls give me very thankfully the girls are giving me they're all like literally
15632460	15637900	everyone streamed every single day which was insane uh within reason of course um and like
15637900	15644620	they're taking it a bit more easy this week which i'm very glad to see we do almost i'm a sneak
15644620	15653980	increase yeah or do you think he notices me at all yeah no uh there are some really nice uh things
15653980	15663900	you can do in vr chat i have seen something i didn't what detected me oh oh no he's discovering all
15663900	15667420	the dead bodies along the way but he doesn't find that suspicious like at all
15671020	15676540	i don't know if my my poor heart can take stronti in 3d it would be so fun because you can see how
15676540	15683900	like animated at um i thought about doing a dance 3d stream where like i play music
15683900	15688380	that you guys suggest and like we just dance and drink and stuff i don't know is that weird
15699100	15705580	just a body nothing so so literally oh well mustn't be anything um i thought that would be
15705660	15710060	cute like rating your songs and stuff but i don't know how good the tracking is like because
15710060	15714460	i want i want to see my butt jiggle i won't be twerking and stuff
15717180	15720380	i know the year is transpiring and it's really endearing how committed you are to making sure
15720380	15727820	everyone eats good both the talents and fun it's right here in my favor i just uh is he gonna just
15728460	15731820	checked me i mean clearly just doesn't care
15734620	15743900	if someone go oh um 3d stronti hypnotizes you that'll be interesting like i just don't
15743900	15750140	know how 3d works at all i think vain or like sony notes are the default for most tracking i've seen
15750140	15756060	vr avatars with pendulum and spiral tall everyone just the exception
15763100	15767820	okay so he does a little uh jabate where he actually comes walking back which is why i'm
15767820	15776780	hanging back right now because he's a wee liar um but yeah 3d definitely on the cards we're just
15777740	15784860	obviously we're kind of in the recoup funds stage um and kind of seeing where everyone is of
15784860	15788620	everyone happy like i sent the girls all the message i was like is there anything i can do to
15788620	15792300	make your experience better like how do you feel after your first week and i got like a lot of
15792300	15801260	good feedback so um i'm just gonna be getting ready to get the girls shorts more consistently
15802220	15808940	because it's taking me a hot second to get shorts that i was hoping to at least get them
15808940	15814220	like two a week out right now it's like one a week oops and that's just because i suck
15816140	15821020	and i'm gonna fall in the water stronti but don't jiggle jiggle it falls
15823100	15828220	my money don't jiggle jiggle it falls i like to see you wiggle wiggle for sure
15828940	15835740	by the way when our membership expected to become available on tomorrow's stream um
15836380	15844300	i'm gonna get it all set up um and all of that so tomorrow's stream isn't gonna be skyrim
15844300	15848220	uh we're not gonna do full achievements because i don't know why my achievements aren't working
15850140	15852780	uh there are enemies all over here but you can just go swinging
15853020	15856940	you picked a bad time to get lost i think if
15861100	15867500	this is no there is a health potion stacked over there somewhere i remember correctly
15870620	15877100	oh i thought there was a health potion here i guess no it's just wine close enough
15877980	15882780	we can sell these potion of strength so there's just spiders in there i don't know if there's
15882780	15889020	anything else you can just go willy nilly through this it's not really um no magic i hate magic
15890460	15895340	i don't want to go i can literally hear that spider in that cave it's membership gonna stream
15895340	15900860	yeah it's tomorrow so the the skyrim part two is getting steam rolled over to make way for the
15900860	15907100	monetization stream and then i'm like a hundred percent sure you guys know exactly what i'm doing
15907100	15917100	tomorrow it's not even gonna be a surprise at this point um but just yeah this is just gonna be a
15917100	15922220	one-off skyrim achievement if the achievements were working then yeah but i don't know why they're
15922220	15929500	not uh so we might actually do a calming a bit earlier than expected she be as live again yes
15929500	15940860	she be cotton boom any any cotton boom um oh my yeah oh he's armored up
15943260	15955420	who's next archer i have no idea what she's doing i'm just stupid to figure out are you
15955580	15960460	wait do you know do you guys wait just take a guess at what you think my monetization stream

15970140	15973020	right where's the guy you should be here oh there is
15975340	15981420	right yeah feet yeah okay feet stream it's feet ASMR i'm gonna have the camera
15982380	15987180	on my feet and because i have dexterity in my toes i'm literally gonna hold the ASMR

16003340	16007980	yeah i know it's ridiculous but i thought it was funny as anything and because my model has like
16008060	16014060	french tip toes i thought like yeah this is perfect i don't think my other toes are gonna
16014060	16021180	heal in time for it though unfortunately it's pretty mangled i don't i don't think i have to go to
16021180	16025420	the doctor i think i have to go to the doctor if it starts getting inflamed you needed to know more
16026380	16032940	now tell you what consider me your new friend in the north i'm keeping the deed any objections
16033020	16037900	consider it a carlaya didn't even want it why did carlaya purchase the golden state now that i know
16037900	16046300	who she may even uh if i was maven exactly this carlaya must have spent a lot of time
16048300	16057820	would be demonetized i mean can you get demonetized it's literally just fee like uh if you cannot
16057900	16063900	take away the ha ha funny from it it's literally just the body part and ASMR and like me is that
16063900	16066540	dog um i heard that
16070140	16075500	gods could you get any more perfect last the only concept i came up for like my monetization celebration
16079740	16084380	people walk on their feet all the time yeah like i just think it's more like funny ha ha than it is
16084380	16090060	like anything else but like i this time so i don't keep repeating it but i generally like
16090060	16095340	feel so feminine now that i've got like my little manicure pedicure like i felt so pampered like i was
16095340	16101180	completely uncomfortable with the entire situation but i did feel really pampered and i was like oh
16102460	16108300	this is actually kind of nice hold on a minute hold on a minute these gender norms have hands
16108300	16115500	god damn it not again i've fallen for another one this is too difficult it's too difficult i can't
16115500	16123500	resist i thought i could can you really not jump this oh fine you are very feminine literally like
16123500	16131420	apparently my hands are super small as well like oh these gender norms have hands foot rubs though
16131980	16139340	i will admit the foot rub that felt like heavenly oh my god like my like brain was like a wire and
16139340	16144060	funny i was like hold on this is like super relaxing i can't believe it all the freaking
16144060	16150620	stereotypes about whamming like in foot rubs are true it's awful i felt i felt so good though i was

16194940	16198940	oh i can't let yous do that the reason why the women could do it is because i had to put my
16198940	16204540	feet in like this little water bath so she had no clue that she was dealing with the sweaty feet
16204780	16211820	so we're now learning that carlaya is this evil evil trying to take down the thieves guild so

16290940	16300220	meet sisero on the road so there is a chance i have faith let's run that guy literally not
16300620	16308620	down the skin whoa who are you oh you're a kaji are you marquette the liar
16312220	16317500	you don't wish me well oh what do you have on your prayer skimmer he's getting high if you
16317500	16321820	didn't know the kaji have a really bad habit with skimmer
16322620	16328380	you found him i knew i recognized i was like is that the liar
16329500	16334620	of course he's a skimmer literally got nothing on his persons but three skimmer he is set for life
16336940	16339260	oh my god we flings we have reform
16341020	16348940	look at that chicken butt chicken butt chicken butt what oh Lydia no way she dances with me what
16348940	16357660	what chicken butt what what chicken butt no no no no no no no no i like how she mimics me
16358540	16367820	chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken oh look it's your egg oh you have so many eggs oh my god this
16367820	16375820	is exactly what i want is this what older like chicken head covers are still like that's amazing
16375820	16381340	oh my god i would absolutely love to do a stream about the domestication of animals as well think of
16381340	16389820	how many endless animal species we have and there's only i think 11 domesticated species isn't that
16389820	16394380	amazing although there was one russian guy who tried to domesticate foxes and he actually got
16394380	16400780	really far but it does take years and years and you can hypnotize the chicken by drawing the line
16400780	16407660	and dirt in front of them oh oh i was a little moan to hit there please email them thank you
16409500	16410940	there's a little shack down here
16415340	16422380	domesticated foxes would be adorable they would oh there's a bear in this shack i recognize this
16422460	16431660	place from many i totally i've never heard a wolf how will like that before but
16431660	16438300	Lydia can you deal with them so i don't have to slow down i'm trying to make it to the location
16440060	16444940	there is probably bandits here actually that's one thing i do have to complain about scarring
16444940	16451500	there's like bandits in every freaking place ever literally i've not even approached this
16451500	16457180	landmark and it's like yeah bandits by the way it's like bro i didn't even get a freaking chance
16457180	16462060	to breathe there's always a bear foxes are difficult the worst part is they pee on everything
16463180	16471820	fox girl gen 2 confirmed made it into peeler confirmed right there's a stable over here so
16471820	16479420	we're gonna head for it what's the difference between taming and domesticating
16481660	16488300	taming is temporary friendship whereas domestication anyone can take over with it i think
16489020	16494780	because you can tame a wild hedgehog but you can't domesticate it
16496620	16502700	yeah no that kind of sounds like i'm on the right tracks but i did just i don't actually know the
16502700	16513500	real can you please discover that thank you peeler my beloved peeler confirmed by strongy
16513500	16523660	fox girl for peeler oh my only reason they're in is because of the the content the girls like to put
16523660	16530300	up domestication is an extremely long process of taming yes i would agree with that statement
16530940	16535100	well they put fast travel on so they had to compensate for people who'd fast travel instead
16535100	16540380	of walk and they need more bandits oh bro every time you want to walk like two centimeters of the
16540380	16545580	game's like enemy enemy enemy enemy taming is when you train a wild animal to be friendly
16545580	16550060	around humans domestications when you breed an animal over multiple generations to benefit a human
16550060	16561500	yes so a lot of people don't know that sheep um infinitely grow will that's because of human
16561500	16567340	selective breeding that they produce so much will and they've now require to be shaved like
16567340	16572220	you ever hear those stories that make the news that's like this sheep evaded the farmer for five
16572220	16579180	years and he has five years of like mats on him and the only reason that's actually even mildly
16579180	16585020	possible is because he was bred that way he was bred to produce like copious amounts of wool
16585740	16591260	and and it's like the same for horses you know how horses need little clippy cloppy horses
16591260	16598700	the reason for that is because of selective breeding and and horse in the wild will naturally wear
16598700	16607660	down it's rocks it's hooves on rocks and stuff like that and what is going on here who's this rk
16609260	16618140	um right yeah silkworms we use for silk can't survive in the world yeah i would really love to
16618140	16624860	do a domestication thing um i'd love to do a history one i just saw that on a per Fox
16625820	16633180	that wolf garden huh i don't think i've ever seen a sheep on the news yeah when you come from Scotland
16633180	16640940	sometimes the news is rather bland um you know not a lot going on in school if you watch the
16640940	16652300	Scottish news oh no he didn't meet why why does the horse who's horse is that hello i'm sorry i'm late
16654860	16660380	hydration check i've scouted the ruins and i'm certain carlaya is still inside
16661660	16668780	you saw her no i found her horse don't take care of it the horse didn't need to perish
16669980	16677340	let's get moving i want to catch her inside while she's distracted take the lead you want me to
16677340	16682300	lead understood just make certain you keep your eyes open carlaya is a selectively breeding
16682940	16688780	stuff for you can't say that that's hilarious you can't say that oh my god
16690540	16696140	that's so true what the fuck that's so funny i'm sorry i can't even laugh at that that's so funny
16704060	16710620	i'd rather the news be bland than hyperpolarizing oh i don't even consume the news anymore where
16711180	16716060	where are you bro i can hear your armor what are you doing okay there you are jeez
16718140	16721900	it's ironic because she's growing so much will have actually become a deficient sheep farmers
16721900	16727100	don't make any money from those synthetic fibers if the police will we have to go back
16728220	16734860	we need to go back please please no more plastic i'd like
16735660	16741740	same i hate watching the yeah like it's just unwatchable it just you you will finish a news
16741740	16749180	broadcast um and you're just like wow i hate life and it was like don't if if you consume things
16749180	16754380	that like genuinely make you more upset at the end of them it's it can be quite addictive and
16754380	16759020	comforting to like watch it in the moment but when you realize it's bad for you like you can just
16759020	16766380	kind of poach trump on it you know come back another time uh there are drogger up ahead but
16766380	16778860	it's not anything you can't handle the drogger i'm actually gonna loot them the reason because

16905580	16910780	but my my favorite thing about morrowind is that you can just jump on the spot um
16913020	16915660	and then like you level up your stamina it's quite interesting

16943500	16948620	cause if i remember correctly there's not that many people left in scotland that can speak it
16948620	16954540	no they don't teach us that uh if you come from the mainland you don't learn gaelic at all um
16955420	16961180	it's basically a dying language because they refuse to teach it to the next generation
16961980	16967740	i don't know if it's gonna change i hope it'll change in the future but sadly no i do not speak
16967820	16974860	gaelic which is just how it is they do not teach it and oh pretty ship

17091820	17098700	which is really cool uh i know it sounds like i'm like speaking it's because i don't use slang
17098700	17106940	at all like at all uh oh we're almost there oh we're almost there yeah i don't yeah i don't

17181180	17186220	online creator it's a complete opposite everyone wants to hear you with a slang in every hand and
17186220	17193100	it's like oh right then i guess it's a bit uh it's a bit forced because i was discouraged from
17193100	17200540	speaking slang these doors have a weakness pc got updates xbox charges per update thus pc got
17200540	17205660	lots of content and xbox charges per update headed in on that

17940460	17945580	three maids um because they were they it was like cheap and it was like i might as well well as the
17945580	17950220	matter because i already know what i'm gonna call them i'm just gonna discover this location
17950940	17954620	i don't know if we're gonna start going against the force one shortly there are another
17954620	17964860	type of bandits essentially uh right how'd i get around i guess i get around oh no rubs corpses
17964860	17969820	look they're not gonna need it let's be honest they're not gonna need that those nine coins
17969820	17975020	gen 3 spoiled no there's absolutely nothing planned of gen 3 i don't even know what concepts i want
17975820	17982220	um and stroney did you see what you want yes what i want i submit what i want and then i get back
17982220	17989020	something and then i keep going to the drawing board that's how it works so you're at my mercy
17991420	18001340	shoulda picked mercy you can't purchase in the afterlife gen 6 confront absolutely no i i am done
18002140	18008940	birthing any children after gen 3 i mean it's also like uh there's a whole other thing to it
18008940	18015580	there's actually a whole other trust factor as well like gen one i completely trust whole heartedly
18016140	18020700	like i did my thorough research on the girls and like when i when i did the interview like i never
18020700	18027260	got any bad vibes or whatever um which sounds terrible like oh you did an interview like an
18027260	18033580	informal interview and went off of was there bad vibes or not and the answer is yeah i did actually
18033580	18039900	um because and when you hear people talk you can get a sense of like especially when they
18039900	18046380	expected like a super um like a super professional thing and you're just like oh surprise it's
18046380	18052220	actually just me me man uh here's here's the rules type thing um mercy's patreon just went live oh she
18052220	18059740	got an update i can't even remember what her update was i i don't know i don't know what the tags are
18059740	18065500	even though i was the one who put that up there for her sounds like you got a trust your gut yeah
18065500	18070460	like i get described as naive a lot which i honestly don't mind i actually genuinely agree with that
18070460	18076860	and kind of assassin sorry i'm just trying to hit loads of markers along the way so we can just
18076860	18083420	backtrack like this super easily um oh is this like a little hunter's lodge thing going on oh it's
18083420	18096380	like a little campsite oh just we eat and good tonight after three generations there's a real
18096460	18106460	risk of bad actors trying to get in it yeah so because i need to choose my words carefully
18107180	18116540	but i hope you can agree with um my my my thought process but it may not be reality because it's
18116540	18126380	just my thought process um it is very plausible that there were v-tubers who were interested but
18126380	18133260	didn't apply because they wanted the guaranteed success of gen 2 like to see what gen 1 achieved
18133260	18142060	to see what gen 2 achieved because not that they didn't put their faith in the plan
18142460	18148780	um it's not so obviously you want to you want to be a part something that's successful let's wait
18148780	18156700	am i on the right way or am i on the wrong way no i'm gonna run um i need to try and think of
18156700	18167980	my sense just like i'm really happy with gen 1 and everyone is good basically however the rate
18167980	18175180	as you said the rate of a bad actor coming into play does get higher um
18178140	18183820	but hopefully you know there's girls like with you know plenty of experience and i can just
18183820	18191820	see and assess them you don't want to risk the gamble yes it's like i don't know how to say that
18191820	18197900	i just knew all the girl i'm trying to have a really nice moment talking about my girls okay um
18200060	18207100	the risk does get higher when new people are introduced that may not have previous history
18207100	18215340	like um what the heck what am i trying to where the heck am i trying to go you can't see me
18216220	18217740	um
18221340	18223660	i think you're doing the right thing you don't want to feel like you're
18223660	18230220	investing your time into the wrong thing yes that like um i did speak of someone who applied
18230220	18234940	and then i went on their twitch just to check them out in general and they spoke about how
18234940	18240540	they only want to hang around for one year and then send their audience to their old account
18241260	18245420	and the quote was like because the creator seems so chill or something
18246140	18253820	and i got an in route um and it was just like kind of shocking and it does like kind of slap
18253820	18259340	me back to reality that like people who apply they might not actually want to hang around and
18259340	18266940	achieve like loads of goals they might just do it to go do their own thing the lover stone this
18266940	18274860	this always feels the comforts love all skills improve faster if all skills improve faster than
18274860	18284620	sure call me the lover stone who would put that on social me out wow wow you know that really
18284620	18291980	happened um they applied their application and i pretty much checked out everyone's stream
18292780	18298620	um uh after they applied just to see what they were putting out there because um there was a
18298620	18305020	very notable trend of people applying and then all of a sudden their stream uh consistency
18305020	18309740	ramped up because they were getting assessed and they were aware they were getting assessed uh
18309740	18316380	i don't think i didn't notice that if you were one of those girls um uh there was also stream
18316380	18325020	variety came out nowhere some people were very glued to one type of game zero um um and all of
18325020	18332700	a sudden they start doing a variety of games kind of showing that they can uh play a different
18332700	18345180	among the games um but yes um i did get to experience someone who openly admitted that they
18346620	18352860	basically applied but couldn't care less about the actual longevity of violour and it is quite
18352860	18361340	scary to think that there's a possibility that even through my vetting process um there is a team
18361340	18373260	who also assessed uh the girls that get in as well um and maybe at a later date i can maybe speak a bit
18373260	18378380	more about it i think now is a bit too sensitive of a time because obviously it's only been
18379660	18385660	one week excuse me sorry just dealing with this guy
18386620	18391100	uh he is a very bad man do not trust him are you good

18417660	18424300	what my like previous sense was azure's voice was too perfect for the character yes i i did
18424300	18429660	admit that if azura did not accept uh i was essentially up shit creek because everyone
18429660	18436860	who applied i was not satisfied with their fit for the voice i did say though i said it before
18436860	18444380	anyone's like that's not fair they were born that way they just got in uh what about rooting for
18444380	18453020	the underdog okay you know fuck off um this agency isn't for fucking like sorry i do get a bit

18877820	18883820	okay
18883820	18888140	am i i thought you were supposed to go that way no i just took poison damage for the hell

18897820	18903340	what am i who or have i gone the completely wrong way
18903340	18907260	okay i think i'm i may have
18909100	18912700	i think i went completely the wrong way pardon me i took it take a look at me
18915500	18920300	uh it's barred from the other side so i was going the right freaking way
18921500	18923260	uh right okay let's try again
18925020	18931020	okay i'm sure i can figure it out when i get there i feel like a some secret offer
18931900	18937820	no these are these are living quarters you're the stealthiest thief ever strong
18937820	18942620	and no one will see you if they're dead exactly i don't know why that's still going
18943980	18948140	because i pulled a lever uh i think i did it on the other side of the poison
18950060	18954300	uh i guess if you wanted to be stealth you could just go through the poison
18954300	18955660	but we'll just go for it
18955820	18961260	we're going we're going we're going
18964620	18968860	i'm being a dome dome okay turn that off

18975820	18980700	and i walked away from them it's just feeling quirky okay just feeling misunderstood
18981260	18984780	oh
18984780	18989820	just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen
18989820	18992220	it's okay just let it happen
18997740	18998860	just let it happen
19001980	19008780	just let it happen it's okay it's okay just let it happen
19008780	19011780	Mmm, big potatoes.
19011780	19015780	Just, oh, 20.
19015780	19016780	Enchanting!
19016780	19017780	That's good.
19017780	19020780	That would be like enchanting up in here.
19020780	19021780	Just let it happen.
19021780	19023780	Okay, we don't really need to...
19023780	19024780	Oh, the box!
19024780	19026780	We need that.
19026780	19031780	Mmm, is this the barred door?
19031780	19032780	It was!
19032780	19035780	Okay, we've now got the shark cut up.
19035780	19037780	So what's this?
19037780	19039780	It's a chest.
19039780	19041780	Ah, and then what's that?
19041780	19043780	That's just the other side of the map.
19043780	19044780	Oh my god, we did it.
19044780	19045780	It's not war crime.
19045780	19047780	It's just a cute girl.
19047780	19050780	Me committing war crimes?
19050780	19053780	Stop, you're making me laugh.
19053780	19055780	Oh my gosh, I'm so turned around.
19055780	19059780	It's been so long since I've done this.
19059780	19061780	It's called Barbarian Stealth.
19061780	19066780	Honestly, I actually really like that description for my thingy.
19066780	19068780	I've always tried to do...
19068780	19071780	What the heck?
19071780	19072780	Jump shot.
19072780	19073780	Oh, right.
19073780	19074780	Wait, what?
19074780	19075780	Where's the...
19075780	19078780	There's a tic-tac to leave there.
19078780	19082780	I don't think there's any enemies until they come in.
19082780	19085780	We just need to pick up some charcoal and a piece of paper,
19085780	19088780	steal the paper, steal the charcoal.
19088780	19092780	It took me so long to figure out this area.
19092780	19094780	Heavy armor increased to 16.
19094780	19097780	It wasn't really worth the level up, but hey, we did it.
19097780	19098780	I'm going to break some...
19098780	19099780	Break it down now.
19104780	19105780	Oh, look at that.
19105780	19107780	Look at that.
19107780	19109780	We do have a bow and arrow.
19109780	19110780	Fire damage?
19110780	19111780	Soul trap?
19111780	19112780	Maybe...
19112780	19116780	No, maybe not a soul trap on us.
19116780	19118780	I would say fire damage.
19118780	19120780	Take a little burn.
19120780	19122780	Now, what pet are your...
19122780	19125780	Bubbish.
19125780	19129780	You know Seagrog method of stealth, honestly.
19129780	19132780	Look, if it works, is there...
19132780	19134780	Is there truly a point?
19134780	19135780	Is there truly a point?
19135780	19138780	Right, so the enemies do come in here.
19138780	19141780	Obviously, because we are playing on legendary mode,
19141780	19143780	and I'm just so MLG pro.
19143780	19144780	Excuse me.
19144780	19147780	We're just going to one-shot them, confidently.
19147780	19149780	We are just going to one-shot them, confidently.
19149780	19153780	We are just going to one-shot them.
19153780	19154780	Nice and confidently.
19154780	19155780	No problems.
19159780	19161780	Acutely commits crimes against humans, honestly.
19164780	19167780	Have you played Ghost of Toshima?
19167780	19168780	I haven't.
19168780	19169780	One shot, 100%.
19169780	19170780	Return to the guy.
19170780	19171780	Where's the guy?
19171780	19173780	Is he in here?
19174780	19176780	Oh, return to the guy guy.
19176780	19178780	Return to the guy.
19180780	19181780	Walk on.
19185780	19188780	Why the heck does it make me go backwards?
19192780	19194780	It says games, but...
19194780	19197780	The mapping is a bit rough.
19201780	19203780	Can I loot this account?
19203780	19205780	They're so good.
19205780	19207780	Wait, are the guards going to attack me?
19207780	19214080	Are the Marker of Guards going to attack me? I'll pick them out.
19214080	19218340	I come back and see you're still in- Eh, no!
19218340	19224260	I'm sorry but these accusations are unfounded. I'm not a novice, I'm a legendary, clearly.
19224260	19229940	Look, I'm sorry to your untrained eye, but when you get really good at the game, it just
19229940	19236100	makes things- Why did it do that? Why did you do that?
19236100	19240700	Why does the game do that? Honestly, I could fart on it something.
19240700	19247260	Yeah, just- It's because I'm such a high-skilled level, it makes it appear to be a very easy level.
19247260	19250380	So please don't worry about it.
19250380	19254140	No, okay.
19254140	19260860	The mages don't let us go into the hall. The mages don't let us go into the hall.
19260860	19264180	I've played this game for two- Eh, how dare you?
19264180	19267660	Why is the child in the basement?
19267660	19271300	Right, here's the translations, bro.
19271300	19276060	I'm rubbing, eh?
19276060	19281700	When you're amazing, you make everything look easy. Yeah, legendary keyboard.
19281700	19285340	See how that's not valued at 50? It's not going to teach you nothing.
19285340	19289460	Don't open that book.
19289460	19292580	Maybe sometime you should judge a bit, but cover.
19292580	19297580	It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the guild for
19297580	19298580	months.
19298580	19302580	Mercer Frey is the baddie! Dun, dun, dun!
19302580	19310820	A very lavish lifestyle, replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures.
19310820	19313900	That's actually my specialty.
19313900	19318540	And yes, Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the guild's treasury
19318540	19321060	without anyone's knowledge.
19321060	19326580	Anything else, Enzo? Anything about the Nightingales?
19326580	19329300	The Nightingales!
19329300	19334500	The last few pages seem to describe the failure of the Nightingales, although it doesn't go
19334500	19336580	into great detail.
19336580	19342020	Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known
19342020	19345100	as the Twilight Sepulcher.
19345100	19348140	Shadows preserve us, so it's true.
19348140	19349980	She bald under that hood!
19349980	19354060	She's not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher, but what is it?
19354060	19356620	What's Mercer Frey done?
19356620	19358980	The Annoying Hunt is actually the bad guy.
19358980	19361260	I'm shocked! Color of me surprised.
19361260	19365620	The gold and right in standards by the dev team.
19365620	19367300	What's called express.
19367300	19369780	Bald! It always annoyed me.
19369780	19378220	When you put on a hood, your hair gets removed and it annoys me so much.
19378220	19379220	It's just such a...
19379220	19380220	Get away from me!
19380220	19384060	Excuse you, anyone talking to you?
19384060	19388580	Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the guild.
19388580	19391380	They respected Carlyer and she deserves better.
19391380	19394540	Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor.
19394540	19396020	Sure! Thank you!
19396020	19400700	You ever managed to gain entry to the college and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen
19400700	19401700	goods?
19401700	19403500	He's a fan!
19403500	19408180	I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time.
19408180	19409780	Questionable interest or like that.
19409780	19412140	You must hasten to rift in before Mercer can do any more.
19412140	19415140	You must hasten to rift in!
19415140	19419140	You've come this far, so I see no harm in conceiving it any longer.
19419140	19420940	Bald gen two member confirmed!
19420940	19422940	No! No!
19422940	19424940	Say it ain't so!
19424940	19431940	I will not go, turn the lights off, carry me home!
19431940	19438260	Oh my god, members karaoke, I can absolutely wreck my voice on that.
19438260	19440020	I can get beer!
19440020	19442540	I can get beer!
19442540	19446660	And we can do membership karaoke!
19446660	19452540	And I can do song requests, like you guys put it together, oh I'm pretty good.
19452540	19461540	And drink to your family, drink it with your friends, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
19461540	19470540	Beer they only drink is made for you, you'll drink till you spew, ew!
19470540	19476540	Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
19476540	19482540	Carla currently and kindly explaining the nightingale lore in her relationship to Gaelas,
19482540	19488540	whilst I sing that one beer parody song that had that Lego animation.
19488540	19490540	Why are you in the basement child?
19490540	19493540	I'm getting, I'm getting weirded out.
19493540	19496540	Get, just leave me alone!
19496540	19498540	Get away!
19498540	19504540	Creepy wee thing, honestly.
19504540	19509540	And you sing Flare of Scotland, no I have to be hate music, I'm not singing, I'm not getting drunk and going
19509540	19522540	Oh, Flare of Scotland, when will we see our life again?
19522540	19525540	Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
19525540	19530540	I don't know why national songs insist on going so high.
19530540	19543540	Like, they, can't you not just, give me one song where like the decibels, the decibels, like the notes in it are just like really common and everyone can sing it.
19543540	19545540	Donald, where are your choosers?
19545540	19547540	What's that song? I think I've ever heard of it.
19547540	19549540	I missed beer whilst I was grabbing a drink.
19549540	19556540	No, no, no, we're gonna do like drunk membership thingy.
19556540	19558540	Back to where I am.
19558540	19561540	Petra also bad poops in.
19561540	19564540	I'm ready, let's go.
19564540	19569540	I was gonna force us to sing Christmas carols on Christmas.
19569540	19573540	I like A Wee and a Manger.
19573540	19577540	A Wee and a Manger.
19577540	19580540	No crib for a pit.
19580540	19582540	Why does it go so high pitch?
19582540	19585540	Why can't they not just have a song that's like down here?
19585540	19588540	No crib for a bed.
19588540	19595540	The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
19595540	19602540	The cattle are lowing.
19602540	19612540	Oh yeah, I was gonna force you guys to do like freaking Christmas songs with me and then we watch Lord of the Rings on Christmas.
19612540	19618540	Let the winds blow high, let the winds blow to the streets and my cattle go.
19618540	19620540	Although as you say, oh Donald, where are you?
19620540	19622540	What the frick, I've never heard that.
19622540	19626540	Do your tit-sangle, do they wobble to the floor?
19626540	19631540	I can't say that, I'm sorry.
19631540	19636540	I'm getting a bit, I'm getting a bit delirious, hold on a minute.
19636540	19638540	You've never heard that song before?
19638540	19641540	I've never heard that song before.
19641540	19644540	Now what's this song called?
19644540	19646540	I've got a sister.
19646540	19647540	She's not even drunk yet.
19647540	19649540	Just talking about alcohol is getting me steaming.
19649540	19651540	It's making me lose the plot.
19651540	19652540	Let me see.
19652540	19654540	No, it can't be.
19654540	19655540	No, it can't be.
19655540	19656540	What's that mean?
19656540	19657540	I've known Mercer too long.
19657540	19659540	He quoted the main.
19659540	19661540	The floor?
19661540	19662540	Yeah, it's a bit dark.
19662540	19664540	We're currently in the sewers.
19664540	19666540	Right under your nose.
19666540	19667540	Do they wobble to the floor?
19668540	19670540	Can you tie them in the knot?
19670540	19673540	Can you tie them in a bow?
19673540	19677540	My kami oshii hates Mongolian throat singing.
19677540	19680540	It's because cats don't like the sound of that vibration
19680540	19682540	that Mongolian throat singing provides.
19682540	19684540	So thus, I don't like it.
19684540	19686540	I don't like vibrations.
19686540	19688540	That rrrrrrrrr.
19688540	19689540	No, bad.
19689540	19690540	Cats don't like it.
19690540	19692540	It makes their ears go back.
19692540	19696540	So it makes my ears go back.
19696540	19698540	The world's greatest thieves live in a sewer.
19698540	19700540	Down in the sewer.
19702540	19705540	Ever listen to the nasty shrank licks?
19708540	19710540	Let's go.
19710540	19712540	The memer is starting to break free.
19712540	19716540	I want to break free.
19716540	19718540	My cat licks it.
19718540	19721540	Your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing
19721540	19724540	and I will not be taking any further statements.
19724540	19728540	I assure you, your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing.
19728540	19729540	Base cat.
19729540	19731540	Absolutely not.
19731540	19733540	Are you sure about that?
19733540	19735540	Rip project when my OSD fans and shambles
19735540	19738540	due to the Mongolian throat singing hate.
19738540	19743540	Me, my life away.
19743540	19745540	I was so hard to sing that.
19745540	19747540	Any song is hard to sing.
19747540	19749540	My voice is so frazzled.
19749540	19753540	I'm just a memer.
19753540	19758540	I mean my life away.
19758540	19760540	Sorry, the thieves gold are now just revealing
19760540	19763540	that Mercer has betrayed them for many years
19763540	19765540	and there's not a penny left for them.
19765540	19771540	I mean my life away.
19771540	19773540	Away.
19773540	19776540	Why is camera the frog in the stream?
19777540	19779540	Crematy frog here.
19779540	19783540	I would like to do some karaoke.
19783540	19786540	Sing your cover live.
19786540	19789540	He also like rock music.
19789540	19791540	We doubt you don't like vibrations.
19791540	19796540	I've got an even funner fact.
19796540	19802540	I only like it.
19802540	19804540	Yes, yes, yes.
19804540	19806540	I killed Gallus, not Carly.
19806540	19810540	Gallus, Carly and Mercer were Nightingales.
19810540	19814540	Carly was behind Golden Glow and Honeybrook.
19814540	19817540	Say it.
19817540	19823540	The magic button cannot handle the vibration.
19823540	19828540	But the dirt road home can.
19828540	19829540	Oh I have permission.
19829540	19831540	Okay infiltrate Mercer's home.
19831540	19833540	Oh everyone's on alert.
19833540	19836540	Alert, alert, Mercer.
19836540	19840540	Alert, alert.
19840540	19844540	Oh I bet we are but you should be here.
19844540	19847540	I don't doubt for one second.
19847540	19848540	I won't remember that.
19848540	19850540	Please continue.
19850540	19852540	Information stored and saved.
19852540	19857540	Yeah, literally there's no doubt about it.
19857540	19859540	The tales get it back.
19859540	19862540	I didn't realise how fake speedish
19862540	19865540	that all the voice actors accent try to mimic.
19865540	19867540	It's actually quite jarring.
19867540	19869540	Be careful.
19869540	19870540	What are you talking about?
19870540	19873540	Hello, hello.
19873540	19876540	This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors.
19876540	19877540	Now go away.
19877540	19879540	I need to get inside Mercer's house please.
19879540	19881540	No visitors, no way.
19881540	19884540	Now piss off before you make me mad.
19884540	19887540	I'll make it worth your while.
19887540	19890540	You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away.
19890540	19892540	Unless you can talk to Maven Blackbriar
19892540	19893540	and let me out of my debt.
19893540	19894540	Okay.
19894540	19897540	Try and set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off.
19897540	19902540	Fine, I'll go talk to Maven about big, big,
19902540	19904540	big stinky, what's your name?
19904540	19911540	Bald, more like cold because it's freezing outside
19911540	19913540	and you're not wearing any outfit.
19913540	19916540	Oh, absolutely rolled and decked.
19916540	19919540	Hello, America Hiya.
19919540	19923540	No, no, no, American.
19923540	19925540	Wednesday is her birthday.
19925540	19928540	I believe it's the 23rd of August if I'm not mistaken.
19928540	19930540	All the crime and corruption in Riften
19930540	19932540	is really getting to him.
19932540	19934540	And now that we hear rumors about the dragon.
19934540	19935540	Is she not up?
19935540	19937540	Where is she?
19937540	19939540	You have some nerve coming back here
19939540	19941540	after what you did to Kirado.
19941540	19942540	He less of a shake.
19942540	19944540	Where's Maria?
19945540	19947540	Okay, hold on.
19947540	19949540	If I put that on, it should show more.
19949540	19950540	Oh, she is here.
19950540	19952540	You were there all along.
19952540	19955540	I presume you're bothering me for a while.
19955540	19958540	Why would you want to help that idiot?
19958540	19961540	He owes me a steep debt.
19961540	19963540	In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work.
19963540	19966540	If he don't want any of it, I'll take a bell for me.
19966540	19968540	What did he do?
19968540	19970540	A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill
19970540	19972540	from a good friend of mine in Winterhold.
19973540	19976540	Do you think Mercer is a claw?
19980540	19983540	He's in debt because of a quill?
19993540	19997540	Is this his quill that's in the freaking lake?
20002540	20004540	Oh, it's...
20005540	20007540	Oh, no.
20008540	20011540	I think it might just be easier to perish this man.
20013540	20015540	I think it's in a boat.
20015540	20017540	Oh, goodness me.
20017540	20018540	It's been many a year.
20018540	20020540	I think it's in a boat.
20020540	20022540	I'm gonna have to look at it on the HUD.
20022540	20023540	Hold on.
20023540	20027540	I want to say it's like somewhere here.
20027540	20029540	To the left.
20030540	20033540	Oh, I could be terribly wrong though,
20033540	20036540	but there should be a boat.
20036540	20038540	It started...
20047540	20049540	It's at the bottom of the lake somewhere.
20049540	20051540	Thank you for your help, Brief.
20051540	20053540	No, I really appreciate that.
20053540	20055540	I am somewhere at the bottom of the lake.
20055540	20058540	I don't even have water breathing either.
20058540	20059540	I can't believe you.
20059540	20061540	You had the audacity to take that out.
20061540	20063540	You're just trying to upset me.
20063540	20064540	What's this?
20064540	20066540	What's that barnacles?
20069540	20070540	I'm already...
20070540	20071540	Oh, my...
20073540	20074540	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
20074540	20075540	Is this a hint?
20075540	20076540	Is this a hint?
20076540	20077540	Hold on, let me breathe.
20077540	20080540	Is this a hint that maybe you were around here somewhere?
20082540	20083540	Hold on.
20083540	20084540	Right.
20084540	20085540	Should we...
20085540	20086540	Oh, no.
20086540	20087540	Right, well, there was a box,
20087540	20088540	but I guess not.
20088540	20089540	There's rocks here.
20089540	20092540	Is that telling me it's here somewhere?
20092540	20093540	Got that barnacles.
20093540	20094540	There's more barnacles.
20094540	20096540	Oh, can you just, like, render distance, please?
20096540	20097540	Stronius.
20097540	20098540	Under the water.
20098540	20099540	You don't want reflins!
20102540	20104540	Ah, let me breathe.
20105540	20106540	I seem to think it's, like, the left side.
20106540	20108540	I saw that storage box.
20108540	20110540	I think that's the game being, like, hint.
20110540	20111540	It's over here.
20113540	20114540	Okay, hold on.
20114540	20116540	Let me just check again.
20117540	20119540	I think it's in a broken boat.
20121540	20123540	It's on the map somewhere str-
20123540	20125540	Right, I'm not reading chat for the next minute.
20125540	20126540	You're on time out.
20127540	20128540	You're done.
20129540	20131540	I seem to think it's close to the edge of the water.
20131540	20134540	Wait, oh, this is a bit too close, clearly.
20134540	20135540	By the bridge?
20135540	20138540	I don't recall it being by a bridge, to be honest.
20142540	20144540	You know what, reflin?
20144540	20145540	What?
20147540	20149540	Stronius, what do you think of the Indiana Jones game?
20149540	20151540	I didn't know there was a new one!
20154540	20155540	Aw, for goodness' sake.
20155540	20157540	I think I'm off the mark.
20157540	20158540	Where am I?
20161540	20163540	Maybe it's, like, down here a bit.
20163540	20165540	I mean, this is the entire area.
20165540	20168540	Okay, I'm just gonna do one big glipper on the island.
20168540	20170540	Why is there so many salmon?
20171540	20172540	Stronius, I love you.
20172540	20173540	Don't hate my friends.
20173540	20175540	Wait, why would I hate your friends?
20176540	20177540	I thought you weren't looking at us.
20177540	20179540	Look, I forgive really easily.
20179540	20180540	Oh no, get up!
20180540	20182540	Shabee, what are you doing?
20182540	20183540	Underwater burning.
20183540	20184540	Drowning.
20185540	20189540	Okay, I don't think it's up this way,
20189540	20192540	but we're gonna just do a big circle
20192540	20195540	for the sake of satisfying myself.
20199540	20202540	Come up for water often.
20203540	20207540	Reeflands, remember that Stronius is as much of an addict
20207540	20208540	as we are.
20210540	20212540	Scuba, Shabee.
20214540	20216540	Shabee, making me nervous.
20217540	20219540	Oh, wait, it may be on one of these islands.
20219540	20221540	It may be rocked up on a baby island.
20221540	20222540	Do you know that?
20222540	20223540	What the heck was that?
20223540	20224540	I'm rabbit!
20227540	20229540	Hold on, let's just check the hut again.
20229540	20232540	Right, we're kind of at the furthest point
20232540	20233540	of this section of the lake.
20233540	20236540	I'm not really wanting to go too much further.
20237540	20239540	It's near the box you found before.
20239540	20241540	Oh my god, I'm actually getting my hand held.
20241540	20243540	See, thank you, Reefling.
20243540	20244540	I actually get my hand held.
20244540	20246540	I knew it was freaking back there.
20246540	20248540	I've gone way off course.
20251540	20252540	Oh my god, I forgive.
20252540	20254540	Fucking Moncaius.
20255540	20259540	It's between the big island and Riften.
20260540	20261540	That's it, I'm giving in.
20261540	20263540	Skyrimmer's been installed.
20263540	20264540	Are you happy now?
20264540	20266540	Oh, have I put you in the Skyrim mid?
20266540	20267540	Yippee!
20267540	20269540	I can't help the sarcasm.
20269540	20270540	I forget where the thing is every time
20270540	20271540	in Wastehaven I was looking.
20271540	20274540	Also, it's underwater, not on an island.
20275540	20277540	Yeah, it's like crashed off of it.
20278540	20280540	My eyes are currently burning,
20280540	20282540	opening under the salt water.
20284540	20286540	Alright, I'm gonna swim.
20286540	20287540	Alright, that's not it.
20287540	20289540	These are just textures.
20290540	20293540	It's not like this, I can't even swim in.
20294540	20296540	So there's no point.
20297540	20299540	I'm gonna go buy that box again.
20300540	20302540	If I could find the box again.
20303540	20305540	We'll float to the right this time,
20305540	20308540	not to be confused with the hit TV game.
20308540	20309540	A little to the left.
20309540	20311540	I don't know why I said TV game.
20312540	20313540	Steam game.
20315540	20319540	So those were the barnacles.
20322540	20323540	I'm getting swept up.
20324540	20326540	We're trying to find the quill.
20328540	20329540	That maven.
20330540	20334540	I did not realise how rubbish this game is.
20334540	20335540	Is this for real?
20335540	20338540	There's like two floating foxes under the camp.
20339540	20341540	What's going on here?
20342540	20344540	I can see loads of broken stuff.
20345540	20347540	Hold on, let me breathe again.
20350540	20351540	Alright.
20352540	20355540	Definitely not searchable.
20355540	20359540	There's like loads of boxes just hanging off the dock.
20362540	20363540	It just works.
20363540	20366540	I think you may have floated over it.
20366540	20368540	It's not by the docks.
20368540	20369540	Oops.
20370540	20372540	I like the detail though,
20372540	20374540	the concept that like it fell off the boat
20374540	20376540	and they can't retrieve it.
20376540	20377540	It's quite smart.
20385540	20387540	This is where I'm on the map.
20388540	20390540	I'm like messing around here.
20392540	20394540	Isn't this rock formation maybe?
20396540	20397540	What the barnacles?
20398540	20400540	Hold on, let me breathe.
20400540	20401540	I'm like right...
20401540	20402540	I'm like freaking...
20402540	20403540	I'm here.
20403540	20405540	I doubt it got dropped here.
20405540	20407540	It just seems so unlikely.
20407540	20410540	Go straight from the docks towards the island.
20412540	20413540	Okay.
20422540	20424540	I'm searching.
20424540	20425540	I'm searching.
20425540	20426540	There's salmon.
20426540	20427540	There's salmon.
20427540	20428540	There's box.
20428540	20429540	There's box.
20429540	20431540	But it's more towards here.
20434540	20435540	Oh, let me breathe.
20435540	20436540	Hold on.
20437540	20438540	Okay.
20441540	20442540	Okay, this is new.
20442540	20444540	I don't think we've investigated this.
20445540	20446540	Maybe we have.
20450540	20452540	I have a freaking potion of water breathing
20452540	20454540	that would make this a lot easier.
20455540	20456540	Water breathing?
20456540	20457540	Where?
20457540	20458540	Water breathing!
20458540	20460540	Oh, hold 15 seconds.
20460540	20461540	Oh, you're too kind.
20461540	20462540	You're too kind.
20466540	20467540	Oh!
20467540	20468540	Oh!
20468540	20469540	Oh!
20469540	20470540	Oh!
20470540	20471540	Oh!
20471540	20472540	Oh!
20472540	20473540	Fucking...
20477540	20478540	Oh, I'm getting current.
20478540	20480540	I'm getting drafted away by the current.
20481540	20482540	Okay, fuck that.
20482540	20484540	Right, we're doing new one.
20484540	20485540	Stop! Current, stop!
20485540	20486540	I can't breathe.
20491540	20492540	Oh!
20500540	20501540	Ah!
20501540	20503540	I've only got 10 lock picks.
20503540	20505540	Gonna be easy on me.
20505540	20506540	I'm gonna need to buy some more.
20508540	20509540	No!
20509540	20510540	Less?
20513540	20514540	I'm like...
20517540	20519540	Is that less or is that more?
20522540	20523540	Oh!
20525540	20526540	Gimme that!
20526540	20528540	Stupid bastard!
20528540	20529540	You're a quill.
20529540	20530540	Right.
20530540	20531540	We did it.
20531540	20532540	Oh my god, that took a while.
20534540	20536540	Just get Volsang
20536540	20537540	and forget about that.
20537540	20538540	What's Volsang?
20539540	20540540	She's got it.
20540540	20542540	If she can open the box, literally.
20542540	20543540	What's inside the box?
20543540	20545540	That fucking quill!
20546540	20547540	You did it.
20547540	20549540	You're the first person in history to buy lock picks.
20549540	20550540	They're so common.
20550540	20552540	I don't want to keep forgetting to fill it.
20552540	20553540	Hi, do you want a quill?
20556540	20557540	I found the quill.
20564540	20565540	Yes.
20568540	20569540	Okay.
20570540	20571540	Oh, okay.
20571540	20572540	Oh, that's Exile.
20572540	20573540	That's not very nice.
20573540	20574540	He's made his pals here.
20575540	20577540	Do you want to reconsider Exile on someone?
20577540	20578540	That's not very...
20578540	20579540	That's not very nice.
20579540	20580540	Have you heard of that?
20580540	20583540	Have you heard how damaging that can be to someone's social life?
20584540	20586540	Makes them feel like they're not a part of the community.
20586540	20588540	Have to, you know, uproot and go elsewhere.
20588540	20589540	Not nice.
20589540	20590540	It's trying to suck at this guy room.
20590540	20591540	I know.
20592540	20593540	Eh, you.
20593540	20594540	Come...
20594540	20595540	Come here.
20595540	20597540	I can't talk to him yet or he'll be aggressive.
20597540	20598540	Like...
20599540	20600540	You.
20600540	20601540	Psst.
20601540	20602540	Psst.
20602540	20603540	Psst.
20603540	20604540	Psst.
20604540	20605540	Here.
20605540	20606540	Over here.
20606540	20607540	What?
20607540	20608540	What?
20608540	20609540	Or Big Vault.
20609540	20610540	Sorry.
20610540	20611540	Big Vault.
20611540	20612540	Oh, oh, he's going to that gate.
20612540	20613540	Hold on.
20613540	20615540	If we're fast enough, if we're fast enough, we can go.
20615540	20617540	We can go talk to him on the other side of that gate.
20617540	20618540	Vault.
20618540	20619540	Vault.
20619540	20620540	Hold on.
20620540	20621540	Vault.
20621540	20622540	It's me.
20622540	20623540	It's me.
20623540	20624540	No, no, no.
20624540	20625540	He's come back to the original position.
20625540	20626540	No, Vault.
20626540	20627540	Wait, Vault.
20627540	20628540	Wait.
20628540	20629540	Let me talk to you.
20629540	20630540	I just want to talk to you.
20630540	20631540	I just want to talk to you.
20631540	20632540	I just want to talk to you.
20632540	20633540	I just want to talk to you.
20633540	20634540	Vault.
20634540	20635540	Vault.
20635540	20636540	Oh.
20636540	20637540	I have something for you.
20639540	20640540	Here.
20640540	20641540	It's your debt with Maven.
20641540	20642540	You're free.
20653540	20654540	What are you doing?
20654540	20655540	How's he added?
20655540	20657540	Are you just coming out now?
20657540	20659540	Oh, he is.
20659540	20660540	Oh.
20660540	20661540	Can't talk.
20661540	20662540	I'm out of here.
20662540	20663540	Okay.
20663540	20664540	Thank you.
20664540	20665540	Thank you very much.
20665540	20667540	Can I just come in this way?
20667540	20668540	Oh, it's barred.
20668540	20669540	Wait.
20669540	20671540	I need a bow and arrow.
20671540	20674540	Or can I just hit this?
20674540	20675540	Okay.
20675540	20676540	No.
20676540	20678540	You need a bow and arrow.
20678540	20680540	I was being a bit...
20680540	20684540	Let me just...
20684540	20685540	Oh.
20686540	20687540	Ta-da.
20688540	20690540	That's how you get the ramp down.
20690540	20691540	Super fuss.
20691540	20692540	He's skipping tone.
20692540	20693540	No reason.
20699540	20702540	I just subbed to all the girls' accounts.
20702540	20703540	Heck yeah, dude.
20703540	20706540	We love supporting gen-mates out here.
20709540	20711540	Oh, the whole linear.
20711540	20712540	You animal.
20712540	20714540	Literally finishing off the kill.
20714540	20720540	She said, nah, I want to be the reason for death on the death certificate.
20720540	20722540	Jeez, Louise girl.
20723540	20726540	The bar is locked in place and cannot be opened.
20726540	20727540	Okay.
20728540	20729540	Any money?
20729540	20731540	Garnet, I'll take you.
20731540	20734540	I can sell it for some money.
20734540	20735540	Statue of Debalah.
20735540	20736540	How about that?
20736540	20737540	Can I move that one?
20737540	20738540	Nope.
20738540	20739540	Can't move that one either.
20739540	20740540	Okay.
20740540	20742540	What's in this house then, I guess?
20742540	20744540	Let's go F myself.
20744540	20745540	Wait.
20745540	20746540	What?
20746540	20748540	This isn't the end.
20748540	20749540	Hold on.
20754540	20755540	Right here?
20755540	20756540	Ah.
20756540	20757540	Yeah.
20757540	20759540	Right, I'm not touching anything else.
20759540	20762540	Suspicious clothes.
20762540	20765540	Honestly, I wouldn't have figured that out more.
20765540	20768540	If we ended up a little cheeky here in the portion.
20769540	20770540	What's this?
20771540	20773540	I have no idea what this is.
20773540	20774540	That looks like a trap.
20774540	20775540	Lydia.
20775540	20776540	Lydia.
20776540	20777540	Lydia, stop standing on stuff, Lydia.
20777540	20778540	Lydia.
20778540	20779540	Lydia.
20780540	20782540	I'm getting sliced in days.
20782540	20783540	Hold on.
20785540	20788540	I'm getting absolutely chopped up.
20788540	20790540	Oh, and there's poison doors.
20790540	20791540	Mine.
20791540	20792540	Goodness.
20792540	20793540	You need to relax.
20794540	20795540	Oh my God.
20795540	20796540	Money.
20797540	20798540	Okay, I've got that.
20798540	20799540	What's this?
20799540	20800540	Eh.
20801540	20802540	What even?
20803540	20804540	What is this book?
20804540	20805540	I have curiosity.
20805540	20807540	What's the contents of this book?
20807540	20809540	I've never actually written it.
20813540	20814540	Lift her tail.
20814540	20816540	Certainly not, kind sir.
20816540	20818540	I am here to clean your chambers.
20818540	20820540	Is that all you have come?
20820540	20822540	Is that all you have come here for?
20822540	20824540	Little one, my chambers.
20824540	20826540	I have no idea what it is you imply, master.
20826540	20828540	I am but a poor Argonian maid.
20828540	20829540	Bro, what?
20829540	20831540	So you are my dumpling.
20831540	20832540	And a good one at that.
20832540	20834540	Such strong legs and shapely tail.
20834540	20835540	You embarrass me, sir.
20835540	20837540	Fear not, you're safe with me.
20837540	20839540	I must finish my cleaning, sir.
20839540	20841540	The mistress will have my head if I do not.
20841540	20842540	Cleaning, eh?
20842540	20844540	I have something for you right here.
20845540	20847540	Polish my spear.
20847540	20848540	But it is huge.
20848540	20850540	It could take me all night.
20850540	20851540	Plenty of time.
20851540	20852540	My sweet plenty.
20854540	20857540	I've never fucking read that.
20858540	20861540	Oh my god, that's hilarious.
20863540	20864540	Many thanks.
20864540	20867540	Not certain how you managed to get your hands on this item we discussed,
20867540	20868540	but I'm more than pleased.
20868540	20873540	I thought you'd simply wait until transported to Castle Diver to its final destination
20873540	20876540	but according to what I've heard, it vanished right from their armory.
20876540	20878540	I wish I knew how you were able to slip by the guards,
20878540	20881540	bypass the porticolas,
20881540	20885540	unlock the armory door and break in at the door of a puzzle-locked chest.
20885540	20887540	You need to teach me that little trick sometime.
20887540	20889540	I've left your cut in the usual drop spot
20889540	20891540	and might have another drop where you soon are.
20893540	20895540	There's three more books of it.
20895540	20897540	Oh my god, but I've never...
20897540	20898540	I knew the books existed.
20898540	20899540	Wait, what am I doing?
20900540	20901540	Expert!
20904540	20906540	Can we do it?
20907540	20914540	Okay, but we have it.
20916540	20917540	Easy.
20919540	20920540	Easy.
20920540	20922540	Okay, a bit more, I think.
20922540	20924540	Or maybe it was left, I don't know.
20925540	20927540	Okay, maybe it's left, you know that.
20929540	20930540	Easy.
20932540	20934540	Easy, I'm getting nervous.
20935540	20936540	Easy.
20942540	20944540	Alright, we got childrens.
20944540	20945540	I'll take childrens.
20945540	20946540	Not a bother at all.
20947540	20949540	Not a bother at all.
20952540	20954540	The rat weevils, yes.
20955540	20956540	Let's go.
20956540	20957540	Let's go.
20963540	20966540	I don't remember what way to go.
20967540	20968540	Is it this one?
20971540	20973540	Oh no, this is if you want Dragonborn.
20975540	20976540	Can you stop attacking me?
20977540	20978540	Whoa, your bull!
20979540	20980540	It's an imperial bull.
20981540	20985540	I think an imperial bull is better than what I've got right now.
20986540	20989540	Although mine does have burn damage, so...
20990540	20993540	I wish YouTube had other emotes, I know.
20994540	20999540	YouTube is like very slowly catching up to the appeal of...
21001540	21003540	I'm not doing any more lockpicking, I don't know.
21003540	21007540	YouTube is very slowly catching up to what the appeal of Twitch is.
21007540	21011540	To the point where it is going to take over Twitch, I'm sorry.
21011540	21012540	It just is.
21013540	21015540	Why did I drop down?
21015540	21018540	I've just added so much time to this travel.
21021540	21028540	I did not recall how long it takes to place Skyrim.
21029540	21032540	We're literally not even finished one questline yet.
21036540	21038540	Tear him up, Lydia!
21040540	21041540	Okay, there we go.
21041540	21042540	Emm...
21044540	21045540	Emmys rats!
21046540	21048540	I'm so confused, where did that come from?
21048540	21049540	I dropped down there.
21052540	21053540	Okay.
21053540	21054540	Ugh, there you go.
21055540	21059540	Channel emotes soon, channel emotes literally less than 24 hours, have fun.
21060540	21063540	Am I almost supposed to speak to Brinyo?
21064540	21068540	You know what, if I had that selected, that probably would have gone a lot faster than what I just did there.
21071540	21077540	Underestimating the 1000 plus hours game, but literally I was like, right, we'll do the Thieves Guild, we'll do Dark Brotherhood.
21077540	21083540	We're literally six hours into this stream, I've less than six hours and I've not even finished Thieves.
21084540	21085540	Oh, sorry, sorry.
21085540	21087540	I got a bit excited there, I apologize.
21095540	21096540	Okay, let's do that.
21096540	21097540	How much?
21098540	21099540	How many?
21099540	21100540	How much heavy am I?
21100540	21103540	Curry, wait, it's 2, 18 out of 3, 30.
21103540	21106540	That'll do, I need like 100 stuff.
21106540	21107540	Hi, Carlaya.
21109540	21110540	How long do we have?
21110540	21112540	Yeah, less than six hours because of this.
21114540	21116540	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
21120540	21123540	No, the wise two people inviting me to talk, there's too many people.
21127540	21130540	Wait, so do you do every sequel?
21130540	21131540	No.
21131540	21141540	I was just going to do Thieves Guild, Black, Assassins, what, that's not what they're called.
21142540	21150540	The Dark Brotherhood, and then the Vampire, and then the main quest, and I've done nothing yet, so I don't think it's happening.
21153540	21155540	Dark Brotherhood, yes.
21157540	21159540	Hi, Brainyo, smashes into wall.
21164540	21170540	The trinity of streams on YouTube, YouTube shorts and recycled clips with 10 minutes highlights on the same platform.
21171540	21174540	And also just a cheat for exposure.
21174540	21180540	Yeah, like Twitch is exposed, it's very interesting to see breakdowns on either website.
21181540	21182540	Like, I've just...
21183540	21185540	Meet Carlaya at the Sanding Zone.
21185540	21187540	Okay, we're about to become a nightingale.
21187540	21195540	I know I've literally skipped through all the dialogue, so for anyone who hasn't consumed Skyrim and is listening in at home, I apologize greatly.
21196540	21204540	I can just give you the TLDR, more than happy to provide such a thing for you.
21204540	21206540	How the heck do I get out of this area?
21210540	21213540	I'll just go out of the docks, how about that?
21213540	21215540	I don't think you can jump over.
21217540	21219540	If you haven't played Skyrim, go play Skyrim.
21221540	21223540	Mind yourself.
21223540	21226540	I'd be a rifting guard, I'd be like, yeah.
21228540	21230540	Don't be causing trouble.
21234540	21235540	Hi, Maul.
21239540	21241540	Any news involving the Dark Brotherhood?
21244540	21249540	Oh, that's the other... that's the Brotherhood quest.
21249540	21255540	Well, that was lucky we talked to him to get that, because we'd probably just have to kill Grelok the kind.
21256540	21258540	And she's actually not very kind.
21258540	21259540	What's this?
21259540	21260540	Oh, it's a clay deposit.
21263540	21265540	The T-Skilled quest line is mostly yapping at this point.
21265540	21270540	Honestly, we're about to become nightingales, and it's about to be yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.
21270540	21272540	I thought I was a good yapper.
21272540	21274540	Yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.
21274540	21277540	Hello, hello!
21277540	21279540	I'm glad you're here.
21279540	21282540	What's the significance of this place?
21282540	21285540	This is the headquarters of the nightingales.
21285540	21288540	Cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.
21288540	21289540	See?
21289540	21292540	We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.
21292540	21293540	Okay, yeah.
21293540	21295540	What kind of an edge?
21297540	21299540	What kind of an edge?
21299540	21303540	If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.
21303540	21304540	Yeah.
21307540	21310540	Yeah, let's edge this way, please.
21311540	21313540	Oh, look at them steps.
21313540	21315540	Look at that bow, though.
21315540	21317540	I actually want that bow.
21317540	21321540	Look at the satchel that the arrow's going.
21321540	21325540	I like how they're coded to look like what the arrow is.
21325540	21326540	Very nice.
21326540	21328540	Very, very nice.
21330540	21333540	I heard about this place when I joined the gale,
21333540	21335540	but I never believed it existed.
21335540	21337540	I never believed it existed?
21338540	21340540	I took enough and I'm back.
21340540	21342540	Are you surprised I'm still on?
21342540	21346540	Um, is Emi's room in today?
21346540	21347540	Emi?
21347540	21348540	Or is it?
21348540	21351540	No, Emi should already be on.
21351540	21356540	Azura should be coming online in two minutes.
21356540	21359540	If I have my times correct.
21362540	21364540	Emi's off today.
21365540	21367540	Just Sheevee and Mersey.
21367540	21368540	So Mersey's on at one.
21368540	21369540	Right.
21369540	21371540	We'll redirect into Mersey.
21371540	21372540	Deal?
21372540	21374540	I'll make you a deal.
21374540	21376540	We'll redirect into Mersey.
21379540	21383540	Yeah, but we're in the nightingales like Robin Hood or something?
21383540	21388540	I, the first time I did this,
21388540	21390540	like the nightingale quest,
21390540	21393540	I was in love with Lady Luck.
21393540	21395540	I absolutely just...
21395540	21398540	Ow, that was very loud in my ear.
21398540	21400540	Hopefully that wasn't too loud in your ear.
21400540	21407540	I just absolutely and truly adored the like,
21407540	21408540	plot.
21408540	21413540	Oh, I like so cool.
21413540	21417540	I just look so amazing and awesome.
21417540	21418540	Everything.
21418540	21420540	I am ready for the oath.
21420540	21423540	Now you go get changed.
21423540	21425540	Best looking armor in the game.
21425540	21428540	Honestly, this armor and Dark Brotherhood armor.
21428540	21432540	Yeah, that's awesome.
21432540	21435540	I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.
21435540	21438540	I may have misheard you, but Mersey is in three hours.
21438540	21439540	No one.
21439540	21443540	Yeah, no, Mersey comes online at one o'clock for me.
21443540	21445540	One o'clock in the afternoon, yeah?
21445540	21448540	That's when Mersey comes online for me.
21448540	21451540	So Mersey's actually perfect for us.
21451540	21455540	Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a nightingale.
21455540	21456540	Whoa, that lass.
21456540	21458540	I appreciate the armor.
21458540	21459540	But becoming a nightingale?
21459540	21461540	That was never discussed.
21461540	21468540	To hold any oath of defeating Mersey, we must have Nocturnal at our backs.
21468540	21473540	If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck.
21473540	21474540	So dramatic.
21474540	21476540	What sort of arrangement?
21476540	21478540	I need to know the terms.
21478540	21480540	What time did I start streaming?
21480540	21483540	Oh, I started streaming, yeah?
21483540	21486540	At 4 a.m., yeah?
21486540	21489540	I started at 4 a.m.
21489540	21493540	I started at 4 a.m.
21493540	21497540	You never wondered why everyone's schedule has a cheeky time zone
21497540	21499540	that no one uses?
21499540	21502540	Because that's my time zone.
21502540	21504540	If it means the end of Mersey Frey,
21504540	21506540	you can count on those night hours.
21506540	21508540	Yeah.
21508540	21510540	Are you ready to transact the oath?
21510540	21512540	Yes, I will become nightingale.
21512540	21515540	Yes, I'm ready.
21515540	21518540	Please stand on the western circle.
21518540	21521540	Holy crap, 4 a.m.
21521540	21528540	The reason why I stream so early is in case I need to do stuff during the day.
21528540	21533540	Originally, it was either I stream at 4 a.m. or I stream at 10 a.m.
21533540	21537540	But the problem is, if I stream at 10 a.m., the day is over
21537540	21540540	by the time I finish my endurance streams.
21540540	21545540	So I wouldn't be able to do doctor's appointments if I need to make an appointment.
21545540	21548540	Lydia, you're going to ruin this so much.
21548540	21551540	Please stand elsewhere.
21551540	21553540	Or just go...
21553540	21556540	Lydia, you're going to ruin this scene so much.
21556540	21558540	I'm not being funny.
21558540	21562540	Come here, Lydia. You're going to ruin the awesomeness of this scene.
21562540	21564540	Lydia.
21564540	21566540	Wait here.
21566540	21569540	Thank you. There's such a beautiful cinematic coming up
21569540	21571540	and they don't know what it is yet.
21571540	21573540	Just let it happen.
21574540	21576540	Oh, not Lydia standing in the corner, right?
21576540	21578540	Just don't look at her. Don't acknowledge her, okay?
21578540	21581540	She's like a dinosaur.
21581540	21584540	Alright, let's enjoy this because this is actually pretty cool.
21603540	21607540	What could you possibly offer me now?
21607540	21611540	I have two others that wish to transact the earth
21611540	21614540	to serve you both in life and in death.
21614540	21616540	You surprise me, Caroline.
21616540	21620540	This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.
21620540	21622540	In my favor?
21622540	21627540	My appetite for mercy tomorrow succeeds my craving for wealth and grace.
21627540	21631540	Revenge. How interesting.
21631540	21633540	Very well.
21633540	21635540	The conditions are acceptable.
21635540	21637540	You may proceed.
21637540	21641540	Lady Nocturne, we accept your terms.
21641540	21643540	I ain't saying none of this.
21643540	21647540	She sells to you as both your avengers and your sentinels.
21647540	21650540	We will honor our agreement in this life and the next
21650540	21653540	until the conditions have been met.
21653540	21657540	Very well. I name your entrance night and day
21657540	21661540	and I restore your status to the same, Caroline.
21661540	21665540	And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain
21665540	21668540	from disappointing me.
21672540	21675540	Wait, we don't get to see her?
21675540	21677540	I didn't see her.
21677540	21679540	Okay, normal. I thought we got to see her.
21679540	21681540	I guess it's with the next cinematic.
21681540	21683540	I don't know. What do you mean we?
21683540	21686540	It's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you.
21686540	21689540	Mercy's true crime.
21689540	21691540	Well, he's done more.
21691540	21694540	Mercy was able to unlock the guilt vault without two keys
21694540	21696540	because of what he stole from the twilight sepulchre.
21696540	21698540	That's Scaly key.
21698540	21701540	By doing this, he's compromised our time to return
21701540	21705540	and in essence caused our luck to run dry.
21705540	21708540	So the key doesn't lock any doors.
21708540	21712540	But the key isn't only restricted to physical barriers.
21712540	21715540	All of us possess untapped abilities.
21715540	21719540	The potential to upgrade power is securely sealed within our minds.
21719540	21722540	Once you realize the key can access these traits,
21722540	21726540	the potential becomes limitless.
21726540	21730540	The three sounds like no one should possess it.
21730540	21732540	Good. Then you understand why this is a...
21732540	21736540	It's too much power for one human to have.
21736540	21739540	If the key isn't returned to its lock in the twilight sepulchre...
21739540	21741540	We see her when we return the key.
21741540	21743540	Yes, we will do that.
21743540	21747540	As time passed, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence.
21747540	21749540	And whether you know it or not,
21749540	21752540	our uncanny luck defines our trade.
21752540	21756540	First time I've ever set out to return something?
21756540	21758540	In our line of work,
21758540	21763540	it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner.
21763540	21765540	Let's go then.
21765540	21767540	Brynjolf has some business to discuss.
21767540	21769540	I suggest you listen to him.
21769540	21771540	All right, big Bryny. What's up?
21771540	21776540	Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer.
21776540	21777540	Uh-huh.
21777540	21779540	The leadership of the guild.
21779540	21781540	Oh my god, he's tapping his way through.
21781540	21783540	Oh, he's doing a wee Irish dance for us.
21783540	21785540	Oh, did-did-did-did-did-did-did.
21785540	21788540	I and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.
21788540	21792540	Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed.
21792540	21794540	After we deal with him,
21794540	21798540	all that remains is restoring the guild to its full strength.
21798540	21801540	Wovens, have you used the skeleton key on someone's torso?
21801540	21803540	What kind of question is that?
21803540	21805540	I'll be back soon to have fun, yeah.
21805540	21808540	Don't worry if you guys need to leave at any point.
21808540	21810540	I'll be-I'll be at it.
21812540	21814540	He is.
21814540	21816540	He's tapping away there.
21816540	21818540	Mm-hmm.
21819540	21821540	Sorry, I'm trying to focus on your words,
21821540	21824540	but your foot is moving and it's making me laugh.
21825540	21827540	It's about time.
21827540	21830540	No, it's not right. I don't know what to say.
21834540	21837540	So don't get sentimental on me now, except...
21842540	21844540	We'll handle the details.
21844540	21846540	Ooh.
21846540	21848540	We have quite the task ahead.
21848540	21851540	Ah! Then let's get to it.
21854540	21857540	What if we try to use the key on Strani?
21857540	21860540	And implying you don't have free reign of me?
21861540	21864540	Refling. You know me better than that.
21866540	21868540	Yeah. Right.
21870540	21873540	Lydia, I'm sorry that I put you in exile.
21873540	21875540	Yes, follow me.
21875540	21877540	My thing.
21877540	21881540	I can't believe I made myself Lydia 2.0.
21881540	21883540	Strani using the key on Refling?
21886540	21889540	It's funny, you think you have any resistance against me.
21898540	21902540	Roy is regaining his own foot in the way he tapped him.
21904540	21906540	Sure.
21907540	21913540	Oh yeah, becoming Guildmaster is bugged if you don't do the radiant quest first.
21913540	21916540	Oh, I've always managed to do them after.
21917540	21919540	I don't even know how they...
21919540	21923540	Where the heck do you expect me to go?
21924540	21926540	Eh, let's do that then.
21928540	21931540	Strani considering you don't have many lockpicks,
21931540	21934540	it may be beneficial just to hold on to it for a while.
21934540	21936540	For a while, honestly though.
21936540	21939540	Right, I need to go a little to the left.
21939540	21942540	Not to be confused with the hit steam game.
21942540	21944540	A little to the left.
21944540	21946540	Let's get to it.
21946540	21951540	If I can get up this hill then the enemies in that building won't be able to know me.
21951540	21953540	Why would I resist Strani?
21953540	21955540	Exactly, why would you?
21955540	21957540	Anyone who puts up a fight gets...
21957540	21959540	Twice as hard.
21960540	21965540	Oh, hopefully you can figure out what the substitute was for that word.
21965540	21966540	That's terrible.
21966540	21967540	Wait, that's north.
21967540	21968540	I'm going the wrong way.
21968540	21971540	No, it's like along the waterfront.
21974540	21975540	I would just...
21975540	21976540	What?
21976540	21977540	Sounds good.
21977540	21978540	Hi, Strani.
21978540	21980540	Dang, you're going hard into this game.
21980540	21983540	We haven't even finished one questline yet.
21983540	21987540	It's officially been six hours and I haven't finished one questline.
21987540	21992540	I completely forgot how just humongous what this game is.
21992540	21997540	It's extraordinary that I haven't actually...
21997540	22000540	I'm about to get close to finishing the thieves.
22000540	22008540	But even then, I'm not even going to truly finish them due to the reason of what.
22008540	22018540	Because we're not even going to do those miscellaneous quests for the Thieves Guild to restore it to its final glory.
22018540	22021540	Because...
22021540	22023540	Do I take the lift here?
22023540	22025540	No, I still don't take the lift.
22025540	22029540	Keep the skeleton key for yourself.
22029540	22033540	No, I'll be a good girl because I want to see a mummy nocturnal.
22033540	22035540	I really like her design.
22036540	22039540	I wouldn't mind incorporating...
22039540	22041540	Well, I wouldn't mind.
22041540	22043540	It's a very good design.
22043540	22045540	Okay, the phone goes the same.
22045540	22047540	How the heck did I get where I'm going?
22047540	22053540	Literally every time I have to go somewhere, I just start spamming E on a hill and I'm like, is this where I'm supposed to go?
22053540	22056540	No, I don't really have to walk up the hill yet.
22056540	22058540	No, I don't have to walk up the hill.
22058540	22059540	It's fine.
22059540	22060540	It's fine.
22060540	22062540	I saw that orbing.
22062540	22065540	Now I'm not sure if I should resist or not.
22065540	22068540	Either way, the outcome is clear.
22068540	22070540	The hor...
22070540	22072540	Oh, I thought it was the wind.
22072540	22073540	It was rules.
22073540	22076540	You don't need the key when you get a log pick into a hundred.
22076540	22078540	Oh, I didn't know that.
22078540	22081540	Does everything just become easy piece of lemon squeezy?
22081540	22084540	Or do the log picks not break on a hundred or something?
22084540	22086540	We're getting there.
22086540	22087540	We can do it.
22087540	22088540	I'm leaving us.
22088540	22091540	We're just a little exhausted.
22091540	22094540	I'm scarous.
22094540	22099540	I thought for some reason, you said I'm scouse and I was like, right?
22099540	22101540	Now what?
22101540	22104540	Oh yeah, by the way, I'm scouse.
22104540	22107540	I like the way you talk, Scottish lass.
22107540	22109540	You know, right?
22109540	22111540	Can I buy a cheeky Maccas?
22111540	22114540	Wait, Maccas is Australian term.
22114540	22116540	I can't believe it.
22116540	22118540	We're boarding live here today.
22118540	22121540	We are going to...
22121540	22124540	This place is actually covered in bandits.
22124540	22128540	I cannot for the life of me doing Australian accent.
22128540	22131540	Who we are?
22131540	22132540	Ray, what's this?
22132540	22133540	A gate.
22133540	22134540	Open the gate.
22134540	22135540	Why not?
22135540	22138540	That may come and help me with future...
22138540	22140540	Go on a Maccas run, yeah?
22140540	22143540	Get in void with me, yeah?
22143540	22145540	Oh, I thought it was going to one shot you.
22145540	22147540	I'm going to be honest.
22147540	22150540	Yeah, you can beg for mercy when you're dead.
22165540	22166540	Oh, I bonked him.
22166540	22167540	Wait, give me that.
22167540	22169540	I will destroy that.
22169540	22170540	What is this?
22170540	22171540	Can someone look this up?
22171540	22173540	What I'm supposed to do with it?
22173540	22175540	Flood, var, la, stone.
22175540	22177540	I don't know what it is.
22177540	22180540	Flood, var, la, stone.
22180540	22182540	I've never seen them before.
22182540	22184540	PC seems to have them.
22184540	22186540	Xbox doesn't seem to have them.
22186540	22188540	But mercy's in three hours.
22188540	22190540	So you should have paid for that.
22190540	22191540	Sorry, I got a lot.
22191540	22192540	Go itch on my head.
22194540	22196540	Speak to Carlaya.
22198540	22200540	Ooh, they got...
22200540	22202540	I... good luck.
22202540	22204540	Egg's fair is a bit much.
22204540	22206540	I've done that for souls.
22207540	22210540	Right, the machines drop...
22210540	22211540	Where's Lydia?
22214540	22216540	Lydia, you do this all the time.
22216540	22219540	There should be an enemy that pops out of here, yeah.
22219540	22221540	Oh, that's right, I remember.
22221540	22224540	These guys used to tweak me out.
22224540	22225540	I'm actually...
22225540	22227540	Tell you what, that was like really loud.
22227540	22230540	I'm going to...
22231540	22233540	Sentence, audio.
22235540	22237540	Is that a bit better on your ears?
22237540	22240540	I feel like whenever that happens, it's so loud.
22243540	22246540	A new hand has touched the beak.
22246540	22248540	Now, these do drop, yeah.
22248540	22250540	That's exactly what I'm wanting.
22250540	22252540	Like, tons of these soul gems.
22257540	22259540	Oh, hold on.
22259540	22262540	246, we're getting there, we're getting there.
22264540	22266540	Yes, oh my goodness, this is what we want.
22266540	22269540	Like, massive amounts of these soul gems.
22269540	22272540	And then we can put, like, really good stuff on.
22272540	22275540	There should be one that pops out of here.
22277540	22278540	Yeah.
22278540	22279540	Oh, I'm getting too good.
22279540	22282540	I'm genuinely too good at this game, I'm sorry.
22282540	22285540	The fact that I remember from childhood,
22285540	22288540	where the enemies, like, come out...
22288540	22291540	I'm just gonna show you how scared I was with the enemies.
22294540	22295540	Come here.
22295540	22297540	Okay, there we go.
22297540	22299540	What was that, three to scavenge?
22299540	22301540	Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it.
22302540	22304540	I'll take it, I'll take anything.
22304540	22307540	I'm happy with anything, any offerings I'll take.
22307540	22309540	Oh, yeah!
22311540	22313540	Is the enemy from here?
22314540	22315540	Here.
22316540	22318540	Oh, I heard that!
22318540	22321540	I heard them, like, spidering up here.
22326540	22328540	I can hear an enemy.
22332540	22334540	Oh, I heard two, just one in there.
22334540	22336540	But I need to go here.
22338540	22340540	They're so tiny!
22342540	22344540	They're so tiny!
22346540	22348540	Oh, we are getting so many soldiers.
22348540	22351540	This is exactly what I was needing, one of the runs in here.
22351540	22354540	That spawn sneak is actually impressive.
22357540	22359540	Ah!
22364540	22366540	There, them.
22367540	22369540	Okay, we can destroy that.
22369540	22371540	Yeah, let's go.
22372540	22374540	Alchemy.
22377540	22380540	Yeah, yeah, I'll take the potions, let's go.
22380540	22383540	Oh my god, I just jumped in real life.
22383540	22386540	Because of that noise, of that latch.
22388540	22390540	Oh, hello.
22395540	22397540	Those bandits back there.
22397540	22399540	Dot, dot, dot.
22402540	22405540	We have to catch up to him before it's too late.
22405540	22409540	I had the brap lever, literally jumped scared of me.
22409540	22413540	I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us.
22416540	22419540	Oh, he really got me there, didn't he?
22419540	22422540	Look, there's so many, oh, soul gems.
22422540	22426540	We love soul gems, soul gems, soul gems, soul gems.
22426540	22428540	Oh, wait, is this the thing?
22428540	22431540	I'm supposed to watch him, look, there he is.
22431540	22433540	Look through the bars.
22433540	22435540	I'm trying to, where is he?
22435540	22438540	I'm pretty sure he pops out somewhere here.
22438540	22442540	And this is a, this is an instance report.
22442540	22444540	I've returned to continue watching.
22444540	22446540	Where?
22447540	22449540	Oh, there he is, there he is.
22449540	22451540	That's Mercer, look, I'm crawling over.
22451540	22453540	Look at this little cinematic.
22454540	22457540	Oh, like, has he just expired right now?
22461540	22464540	Oh, he didn't even move a sword.
22467540	22470540	Eyelash, and we'll be ready for him.
22471540	22473540	Man, FOV is so low.
22473540	22476540	Do you get motion sickness? No.
22478540	22482540	I'm very lucky, Mercer says she gets motion sickness playing video games.
22482540	22485540	Not to be dramatic, but I think I would end it.
22485540	22488540	Oh, God, I think there's farmer around here.
22490540	22491540	What's this?
22491540	22493540	Potions.
22493540	22497540	Lutions and potions, I do love a good, I do love a good collection.
22497540	22500540	Isn't there a farmer here? No?
22500540	22501540	Empty?
22501540	22503540	Oh, found him.
22503540	22504540	Found him.
22504540	22508540	Shit, and I have course of poison.
22508540	22510540	What does he draw?
22511540	22514540	Skibertail, nah, you're good.
22514540	22517540	You, I want your soul gems.
22518540	22520540	Who am I perishing?
22520540	22523540	Why is Mercer such a poopy poopy?
22534540	22538540	I just smacked myself into a wall at low health.
22538540	22540540	Okay, that'll do.
22540540	22542540	I think I'll be okay though.
22542540	22545540	That was a jump scare and a half.
22548540	22551540	Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.
22551540	22554540	Actually, it's probably really good that I have that on a panic,
22554540	22557540	because it gets me away from the enemy really quickly.
22558540	22561540	What the heck is this? Let's just stop.
22563540	22565540	Oh, I need to go up.
22566540	22568540	Excuse me?
22571540	22575540	The freaking blades on the ground took all my expert!
22576540	22578540	Are we having a troll?
22586540	22588540	And where's the other lever?
22589540	22592540	Excuse me, Brinyel, if you're just smacked me in the...
22592540	22594540	That's the other lever there?
22595540	22597540	Behind an egg spare?
22598540	22600540	That can't be right.
22600540	22602540	Surely not.
22602540	22604540	But it is.
22608540	22611540	That cannae be right, don't you have the skeleton key?
22611540	22613540	No, we've not done that part.
22617540	22619540	But that is it.
22623540	22626540	Well, good thing I don't have a smurf it, but what?
22626540	22629540	Wait. Oh, that's not the lever at all.
22631540	22633540	Where the heck's the first lever?
22636540	22638540	Is it here?
22640540	22643540	Where's the second lever? Reveal yourself!
22646540	22648540	What?
22648540	22651540	There it is! Oh, it's adjacent to the other lever!
22651540	22653540	Oh my god.
22653540	22655540	Did I need to go all the way back again?
22655540	22658540	Out my way, out my way, out my way, out my way.
22658540	22660540	I'm not that fast.
22660540	22662540	Hold on, hold on, I need to cheat.
22662540	22664540	I'm not that fast.
22664540	22668540	I was gonna say, putting something behind an expert level thing is wild.
22673540	22676540	That wasn't it? Okay, I was gonna say, that has to be it.
22676540	22678540	I refuse.
22679540	22681540	A little cheeky chess.
22683540	22686540	I'm being trolled by this game.
22691540	22694540	I'm being through trolled.
22694540	22698540	I'll destroy that, and then I can get more thingy.
22698540	22700540	Are we there yet, bruv?
22700540	22703540	I feel the same, we've literally not even finished one questline.
22703540	22705540	I'm ready to make another cup of tea.
22705540	22710540	Alright, you can stealth this area, but I'd rather just go for it.
22710540	22712540	I'd rather just go for it.
22721540	22724540	By the Pope, who's there? Identify yourself.
22724540	22729540	There is a chess down below, but I'm not really fast right now.
22729540	22733540	I want to finish one questline!
22733540	22736540	One questline is all I have.
22736540	22739540	Stop it, you're so stinky.
22741540	22743540	Okay, hold on, you got something?
22743540	22744540	Charmin's Key.
22744540	22747540	What was this, a Charmin's Key, dude?
22747540	22749540	Oh, is it for that?
22749540	22751540	You know what, maybe this chest.
22752540	22753540	No, it's not.
22753540	22755540	Well, I'm not looting it then, go away.
22755540	22758540	I don't know what the heck the Charmin's Key is for.
22758540	22761540	Clap him, stinky lightning, honestly.
22761540	22762540	How do you come back from that?
22762540	22765540	Someone calls you stinky, you have no way of coming back, truly.
22765540	22768540	It's over for you, just admit it.
22768540	22770540	There's traps everywhere.
22770540	22773540	Isn't there a massive Centaurian coming up?
22773540	22777540	My brains just reminded me that there's a big enemy coming soon.
22780540	22782540	What does that say?
22782540	22785540	Bro, the game thinks I can read that?
22785540	22787540	Mercer, it's backwards!
22787540	22790540	Mercer is on the bottom.
22796540	22798540	Why is that backwards?
22798540	22800540	I can read Mercer as backwards.
22800540	22802540	I don't mind the stinky.
22802540	22804540	I don't mind the wires.
22804540	22805540	What, an air?
22805540	22807540	Why is it backwards?
22809540	22812540	I'll take these scrolls because I can sell them for money.
22818540	22820540	Let's go, let's go.
22823540	22826540	This is very real.
22829540	22831540	Oh, dear.
22831540	22836540	Right, can you jump the Centaurian and not me, maybe?
22836540	22839540	Oh, goodness, gravy.
22839540	22844540	Some of these enemies are my right fellows.
22844540	22846540	All my fellows.
22849540	22851540	Oh, hold on.
22851540	22853540	Hold on, right there you go.
22855540	22857540	Alright, I should probably go to sleep.
22857540	22858540	See you next time.
22858540	22859540	Rest well, those who sleep.
22859540	22862540	Please don't worry if you do need to go to sleep again.
22862540	22868540	But the cheeky endurance stream, Mercer is going live in T-minus less than three hours.
22868540	22876540	We're going to read Inter because my Skyrim escapades got cut short due to the fact that...
22876540	22881540	Oh, I am moving so fast I am successfully avoiding all the traps laid out.
22881540	22886540	Yes, I don't know why achievements aren't popping up.
22886540	22892540	I'm literally using Xbox Game Pass right now, so it's kind of the...
22892540	22897540	I'm not sure what the dealio is, but I'm quite happy just to play through the...
22899540	22903540	Thingamabobber and tomorrow's monetization celebration.
22906540	22910540	So I guess I can enjoy a more relaxed for my voice.
22910540	22912540	Oh, come on.
22914540	22916540	Oh, come on.
22916540	22918540	Get a rest.
22918540	22919540	Oh, I'm low health.
22919540	22920540	Oh, I'm low health.
22920540	22922540	I'm about to get altered by a spider.
22922540	22923540	Hold on.
22923540	22925540	Okay, there we go.
22927540	22929540	Go around to read it.
22930540	22932540	Go around it to read it.
22932540	22937540	Oh, is there like another room that makes a lot more sense if there was like something behind it?
22937540	22941540	Maybe I just ignored it and chose to be confused.
22942540	22943540	Oh, give me that.
22943540	22945540	Oh, orcishbowl and ice.
22945540	22947540	Oh, and alchemy.
22947540	22949540	Resurrect and restore my energy.
22955540	22958540	Alchemyxing like a creature.
22960540	22963540	Give me them juicy soul gems.
22963540	22964540	That's all I want.
22964540	22965540	That's all I crave.
22965540	22967540	I just want soul gems.
22969540	22971540	Oh, why don't I get one of you?
22971540	22972540	No.
22973540	22974540	Okay, okay, okay.
22975540	22977540	You guys don't need to perfectly follow me.
22977540	22978540	You do realize that, right?
22978540	22979540	But we can do this.
22980540	22985540	And we completely missed them because we alerted the enemies to our location.
22988540	22989540	Okay, there we go.
22989540	22990540	Oh my God, he's beat.
22990540	22991540	They're jumping me.
22993540	22995540	I'm actually beating that.
22995540	22998540	God, they have so much venom.
22999540	23001540	So much venom.
23002540	23004540	Don't mind if I do it.
23004540	23007540	Well, on earth where they do it, she be.
23007540	23009540	What have you been doing in your dungeon?
23009540	23011540	These last words?
23011540	23012540	Oh my God, that's brutal.
23012540	23013540	Hold on.
23014540	23016540	These last words.
23017540	23019540	Nobody thought they were real, but I've seen them.
23019540	23021540	The eyes of the snow elves.
23021540	23023540	The dwarves thought they looked...
23023540	23026540	The dwarves thought they took them from the Thammer,
23026540	23027540	but they themselves were fooled.
23027540	23029540	A statue built in secrecy by the slaves.
23030540	23032540	The eyes burn into you, and I see them.
23032540	23035540	Even the Seraphot escaped through the collapsing tunnel,
23035540	23037540	but he'll never escape what we've seen.
23037540	23040540	Men will never believe him, and he'll be driven mad by the knowledge
23040540	23042540	that he'll never see them again.
23042540	23045540	But I may yet see them again before I die.
23048540	23050540	Wow, that was strange.
23051540	23053540	Strawny's a soul gem addict.
23053540	23056540	Literally, they're like the most OP leveling up system.
23056540	23057540	I'm just gonna blast through this area
23057540	23059540	because there's a massive flamethrower, I think,
23059540	23061540	or something.
23066540	23068540	How am I detected if I'm around the corner?
23068540	23070540	Why are you going for me?
23070540	23072540	He's right there!
23075540	23077540	Literally, right in...
23077540	23078540	Actually, I just remembered,
23078540	23080540	Mercer drops are really good.
23080540	23084540	Two-handed sword, and we already got children.
23084540	23087540	Yeah, that's right. Spank that rat on the fire.
23092540	23094540	Oh, that's cool.
23099540	23100540	Oh, I'm getting...
23100540	23103540	Yeah, okay, I was gonna say I'm getting blasted by this.
23104540	23107540	We may yet to see Strawny's eyes before we die.
23110540	23112540	I might need to heal.
23114540	23116540	Or I might get away with it.
23120540	23121540	Ooh, we've been...
23121540	23122540	Oh, I got detected.
23122540	23125540	I keep going like, alright, I'll finally go sneak,
23125540	23129540	and then I get detected because I'm not paying attention.
23131540	23133540	Touch this.
23133540	23135540	Eat this.
23135540	23137540	Fun fact, the Dwemer nailed and scrolls are not doors,
23137540	23139540	but actually, a type of elf.
23139540	23140540	Two-handed.
23140540	23142540	He's in a drill wheel there.
23142540	23144540	Exactly.
23144540	23146540	Imagine not being a drill wheel there.
23146540	23148540	I can't relate.
23148540	23151540	I've tried so many times to be an archer,
23151540	23153540	but I just can't do it.
23153540	23155540	Like, especially when the enemy come up in your face
23155540	23157540	and you've got a bow and arrow,
23157540	23160540	it's like, bro, it wouldn't actually be so fero-fero.
23162540	23165540	I think that actually does more damage to the mother.
23167540	23170540	Wait, can I get them to deal with the enemies?
23170540	23172540	Oh my god, that's so cool.
23172540	23174540	I can like, go through here.
23174540	23178540	Is there like a treasure chest or something?
23178540	23180540	Or is this just like a...
23180540	23182540	Hurry up.
23182540	23184540	Wait, that symbol.
23184540	23186540	That means there's loot here?
23186540	23188540	I don't see no loot.
23188540	23191540	Or does it just mean that the thief's guild was here?
23195540	23197540	Okay.
23197540	23199540	I'm so confused.
23200540	23203540	I feel like there may have been something I missed,
23203540	23205540	but hey ho.
23206540	23208540	Alright, let's get to it.
23208540	23210540	Everybody get to it, to it.
23210540	23212540	Let's get this party started.
23212540	23214540	Let's get this bonus.
23214540	23216540	Departed.
23216540	23218540	Mercer was here.
23218540	23220540	Shield 100 is perfectly viable, thank you very much.
23220540	23222540	Probably.
23222540	23224540	What do they hold?
23224540	23226540	So they just kind of hold a lot of like, mix and stuff.
23226540	23228540	That's interesting.
23228540	23231540	They were more into like, the alchemy side of things.
23231540	23233540	Master lot?
23233540	23235540	Right, I'm not bothering.
23235540	23237540	So it's on your bike.
23240540	23242540	Hydration check.
23248540	23250540	Oh.
23250540	23252540	Wow.
23256540	23258540	Wow.
23266540	23268540	Such a shit.
23272540	23274540	Yeah, give me the key, Mercer.
23281540	23283540	The water's rising.
23295540	23297540	I don't believe you, no.
23297540	23299540	Turtle gates me, my new friend leaking.
23310540	23312540	Oh.
23312540	23314540	Dun dun dun.
23314540	23317540	The difference is, I still have honor.
23330540	23334540	If anyone falls, it'll be you, Mercer.
23340540	23342540	Nightingale.
23344540	23349540	I can't remember if this is hard or not.
23349540	23351540	Oh no, he got wallets.
23351540	23353540	Oh, he's got blood drain.
23355540	23357540	Oh my god.
23360540	23361540	Where is he?
23361540	23363540	I can just see the red doll.
23363540	23365540	I'm chasing the red doll.
23365540	23367540	There he is.
23367540	23369540	I found him.
23370540	23371540	I got him.
23371540	23374540	He's got, whoa, he's got like, yeah, I'll take all that.
23374540	23376540	Shit, give me everything.
23376540	23379540	Oh, I'm carrying too much to be able to run.
23379540	23381540	Oh, sorry, hold on.
23381540	23386540	Sorry, excuse me, just need to drop a few things that I don't need.
23386540	23390540	I don't need an embalming tool, I can show you that much.
23390540	23394540	Don't need random chunks of ore, that's fine.
23394540	23396540	A what?
23396540	23398540	It looks like a ship.
23398540	23400540	Is that a tap?
23400540	23404540	Yeah, don't need all these random miscellaneous things, that's fine.
23404540	23408540	Ingredients that could probably eat all the little ones
23408540	23412540	and clear up some side space stuff, I guess.
23412540	23415540	Unknown, unknown.
23415540	23418540	Sorry guys, I know the cave is collapsing, it's very important.
23418540	23422540	I have a little taste test of all these ingredients, I assure you.
23422540	23425540	Food, yeah, sure, let's just freaking load up.
23425540	23427540	Am I light yet?
23427540	23430540	No, I'm not light yet, holy crap.
23430540	23433540	Okay, right, what do we not need?
23433540	23436540	That does say 26, not gonna lie.
23436540	23439540	Oh, I forgot to...
23439540	23441540	That one's better.
23441540	23446540	I don't want to drop it though, I feel like I can sell it for decent money, honestly.
23446540	23451540	I guess we'll just drop that shit.
23451540	23454540	Orcishbowl, 11.
23454540	23457540	Please don't really give me much money.
23457540	23460540	Okay, so don't panic.
23460540	23463540	I know the cave is literally...
23463540	23468540	Oh, I know the cave is like perishing and it's falling with war,
23468540	23472540	but don't panic guys, everything is okay, alright?
23472540	23474540	You just have to let it fill.
23474540	23478540	Oh, oh he hit the quaw.
23479540	23482540	Oh, are you guys okay? Do you guys need to breathe? No?
23482540	23485540	No, you don't need to breathe? Okay, you don't have to.
23485540	23495540	If you look above the head of the elf, you'll notice those rocks look very suspiciously movable.
23495540	23500540	That's because they are, you have a keen eye, refling, you have a keen eye.
23501540	23507540	I'm strong enough to taste test all the new alchemy ingredients,
23507540	23511540	literally like trying to like release some of the weight in my inventory,
23511540	23517540	and I'm like, hmm, yes, hmm, this moth wings though, what a delicacy.
23517540	23521540	You just have to wait, unfortunately you can't like swim upwards,
23521540	23526540	it doesn't do it the way you want it to, so it's a bit awkward.
23526540	23528540	But yeah.
23528540	23532540	I remember the first place where I was trying to like swim through these pipes,
23532540	23536540	I was like, yes, the pipes, the pipes will save me.
23536540	23539540	But it should do one big collapse.
23539540	23542540	There you go.
23542540	23545540	Pick it long enough, honestly.
23545540	23551540	And then you just gotta wait until it gets high enough to get up there.
23551540	23554540	To shift the weight in my body eats 50 cheese wheels.
23554540	23556540	We are aquatic.
23556540	23558540	Let me see some tools.
23558540	23561540	Stopping to release, yes sir.
23561540	23565540	But as faster you get out of that cave, the easier the game.
23571540	23576540	I have completely forgotten how much the NPCs love to talk to you.
23576540	23578540	No.
23578540	23580540	Five years.
23581540	23584540	No, Carlisle.
23589540	23591540	It's not simple.
23594540	23597540	Sepucar, I've never said sepucar.
23600540	23604540	Are you ready to take a pilgrimage together?
23606540	23609540	We can serve nocturnal in other ways.
23609540	23613540	As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing.
23613540	23616540	Then we'd best get started.
23616540	23620540	We don't need it back if a thief's going to keep order while you're away.
23620540	23626540	And I can't bear to face nocturnal, I don't need to protect the king.
23626540	23629540	I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.
23629540	23632540	Okay, we can do it alone. We're big boys and girls.
23632540	23634540	Take this with you.
23634540	23636540	Help within the walls of the sepucar.
23636540	23639540	Oh, she gives me her bow.
23643540	23645540	Oh.
23647540	23649540	Okay, I'm actually hitting it.
23649540	23651540	Sorry, last round. Okay, you can't talk to me.
23651540	23654540	Ow, I just got blammed by that skull.
23654540	23656540	I literally yanked the HP off me.
23656540	23659540	Can we serve Strony in other ways?
23659540	23661540	Absolutely.
23662540	23665540	It depends what you're offering is to me.
23667540	23671540	Aw, I've not even been a folk wreath yet.
23673540	23679540	Actually, you know what? I need to destroy and enchant a few things to sell on.
23679540	23683540	So I'm going to go do that now and it will free up a lot of inventory.
23683540	23686540	Is Carlisle the same VA as Shadowheart?
23686540	23688540	I cannot tell you that. I don't know.
23688540	23691540	Well, there's gates such good reviews, though,
23691540	23694540	that I'm really tempted to play it for the first time on stream,
23694540	23697540	but I'm worried in case I'm so dumb I can't figure it out,
23697540	23701540	but hopefully it's a full-proof game like anyone can just jump in on the fun.
23701540	23703540	Right, this is what I want.
23704540	23708540	Devouring, archery and potions.
23708540	23711540	Everything else can be sold. You heard it here first.
23714540	23717540	Did I even have a big gem?
23718540	23720540	I do.
23720540	23723540	Yes. Did I make it craft?
23723540	23725540	Yes.
23725540	23727540	That was bloody good shoe.
23727540	23729540	That bloody good shoe.
23729540	23731540	Right, where's that?
23731540	23736540	So what? Just enchant random stuff now for the XP, I guess?
23736540	23739540	Turn undead. Frost damage here, why not?
23739540	23741540	Petty Soul Gem.
23741540	23744540	Yeah, I'm just going to put Petty Soul Gem stuff on it.
23745540	23747540	Uh-uh.
23747540	23750540	And then I know I can sell everything in my inventory.
23750540	23753540	God, look at the level up. It's so fast.
23753540	23756540	The game is so forgiven.
23761540	23763540	Just the noise.
23764540	23767540	It's just constantly like...
23768540	23773540	We'll put all of this stuff on and then we can get a pretty penny.
23773540	23775540	Oh, we might be able to buy the home.
23775540	23778540	We might be able to buy our home in Riften.
23779540	23783540	And then we can have our little flower garden out in front.
23784540	23787540	We can't get chickens though. Not yet.
23787540	23790540	Baldur's Gate 3 is good and you can do whatever you want.
23790540	23792540	It's not really wrong way of playing it.
23792540	23794540	Baldur's Gate is really open and rewarding.
23794540	23796540	I'm glad.
23797540	23799540	Um...
23801540	23803540	I can't figure it out.
23803540	23807540	Also tells us, please backseat me. You'll be fine.
23807540	23812540	Yeah, some folk really are so strongly like a little bit backseat gaming.
23812540	23816540	I'm actually going to travel to Riften just to sell some stuff
23816540	23818540	because my inventory is getting a bit too full.
23818540	23823540	Now, as much as I like being full and, you know, a bandaid slapped on top
23823540	23825540	Not like this.
23834540	23838540	I would like to sell some weapons that are very heavy.
23841540	23844540	I will keep children. I'll put it elsewhere.
23848540	23850540	I don't want to sell that stuff.
23850540	23852540	I'd rather keep it.
23852540	23856540	I can sell, like, all of it, right? You're out of money.
23858540	23860540	I will remember that.
23863540	23865540	You can marry the butcher.
23865540	23867540	He's not a butcher. He's a blacksmith.
23867540	23869540	Those wires are really crossed on me.
23869540	23876540	Please take some of my stuff that I don't need.
23876540	23878540	Thanks. Appreciate it.
23879540	23882540	Created potions are 1% more strong.
23882540	23885540	Wait, no, actually, I'm going to keep the diamonds and stuff on me.
23885540	23892540	The reason for that is because you can get, like, miscellaneous quests to ask for that basic stuff.
23892540	23894540	How about you?
23896540	23898540	Everything I've got on display, really.
23898540	23902540	We're going to get rid of all this. This should really lighten the load.
23903540	23906540	I don't want to sell that thing.
23906540	23909540	Oh, I completely forgot I have, like, golders.
23911540	23914540	That must be... Oh, he's not going to gold left.
23914540	23915540	Oops.
23915540	23917540	Oops, I'm giving away things for free.
23917540	23918540	Oopsies.
23918540	23919540	Oopsies, tee-hee.
23919540	23920540	Little tee-hee moment.
23920540	23923540	Right, we'll go Falkreath, and then we'll hit up Twilight's.
23923540	23925540	I love her.
23925540	23928540	Strangely, I will remember everything you said.
23928540	23931540	Fair enough. I don't even know what to say half the time.
23931540	23932540	I'm just here for a good time.
23932540	23935540	Do you remember when we almost got our heads chopped off?
23935540	23937540	Yeah, and I was taken over by bandits and burnt tickers.
23937540	23940540	Tee-hee, not my problem. Tee-hee.
23942540	23946540	Stony, ever dropped a bunch of jewelry in the shopping centre in Riften?
23946540	23950540	Everyone starts fighting over stuff you drop,
23950540	23953540	and, like, it literally terminates NPCs, and it's like,
23953540	23955540	I've need them for quests.
23955540	23959540	That's the one thing I could absolutely obliterate Skyrim for,
23959540	23964540	is if a quest requires an NPC,
23964540	23967540	do not let them be perishable.
23967540	23969540	Do not let them expire.
23969540	23971540	I am so sad.
23971540	23973540	What the heck is...
23973540	23976540	Oh, no!
23978540	23981540	The wolves jumped these poor people,
23981540	23984540	and the one wolf perished them both.
23986540	23988540	Mmm.
23988540	23992540	That's what you get for trying to execute an innocent dragonborn.
23992540	23994540	Some of them are marchers,
23994540	23997540	and some NPCs can't be perishable,
23997540	23999540	but if they have a quest,
23999540	24001540	I feel like they shouldn't be able to expire at all,
24001540	24004540	because it's so annoying when you're trying to do it,
24004540	24006540	and then it's like, oh, surprise, by the way.
24006540	24008540	Oh, who are you? Hello.
24009540	24011540	What's a milk drinker like you doing out here?
24011540	24013540	Go home to your mother.
24039540	24044540	Yeah, I'm starting to think we're getting, like, absolutely nothing done.
24044540	24047540	We're pretty much looking at T-minus two hours.
24047540	24049540	I've been live for almost seven hours.
24049540	24051540	I've yet to finish the quest.
24052540	24054540	Eh, right. Fault creases here.
24055540	24057540	What the heck is that?
24059540	24060540	Bro!
24060540	24063540	You can not drop rocks on people's heads.
24063540	24066540	I cannot tell you how inappropriate that is.
24067540	24068540	Um...
24069540	24072540	I am home with my mommy.
24072540	24075540	We drink milk and tea up in this place, of course.
24078540	24080540	Literally, how have I been at this for seven hours?
24080540	24082540	I'm not completed one quest.
24082540	24084540	Something's not adding up. I don't know.
24084540	24088540	Like, I'm pretty sure the Skyrim World record is, like, two hours.
24088540	24091540	Like, one hour and 52 minutes or something.
24091540	24093540	Ridiculous, like that.
24093540	24096540	And you're telling me in seven hours,
24096540	24099540	near seven hours, I couldn't finish one quest line.
24102540	24105540	Well, I need sleep. Good night. Thank you for hanging.
24105540	24107540	No promises, I won't see you in my dreams.
24107540	24110540	That's right. Get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish.
24110540	24112540	Your only dream of a Scottish.
24113540	24116540	The Highland Cows call you.
24119540	24121540	Ooh, I don't want to walk over a grave.
24121540	24123540	That's bad luck.
24123540	24126540	That's a lot of graves. What's going on in full graves?
24126540	24128540	I feel like that's probably a quest, cause...
24129540	24130540	That's a lot.
24131540	24132540	Scotland!
24132540	24134540	Forever!
24138540	24140540	Get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish.
24140540	24141540	I think I need to do that.
24141540	24142540	Someone did that where I was like,
24142540	24144540	get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant.
24144540	24145540	And it's like, dang, dang, dang.
24145540	24147540	Like, really intense music.
24147540	24150540	I want to do that, but like, get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish.
24152540	24154540	We're almost there.
24154540	24156540	We're almost there, we're almost there.
24156540	24158540	We just got to run a little bit longer.
24161540	24163540	Oh, there's castles and ruins.
24164540	24168540	Did you know you can just straight up buy castles in Scotland?
24168540	24170540	Fun fact, you can literally look up them online.
24170540	24172540	Just type in Castle for sale in Scotland.
24172540	24174540	I'm not even kidding.
24175540	24178540	It's pretty intense and cool.
24179540	24181540	And you can buy churches.
24181540	24183540	It's a lot cheaper to live in a church.
24183540	24185540	An ex-church, by the way.
24185540	24188540	You can literally, it's like, churches for sale in Scotland.
24188540	24189540	Yeah, just have a look.
24189540	24191540	It's like, way cheaper.
24193540	24197540	Johnny, have you heard of the Scott Wikipedia vandalism story?
24197540	24198540	Yes!
24198540	24200540	Oh, we should talk about it.
24200540	24203540	Like, if you didn't know.
24203540	24206540	So, Scots is basically slang.
24206540	24209540	And we say things very phonetically.
24209540	24211540	And someone...
24212540	24215540	Whoa, wait, I didn't realise you were a bandit.
24215540	24216540	Sorry.
24216540	24218540	Time to go, buddy.
24221540	24223540	And someone basically went,
24223540	24226540	Oh, I'll just rewrite this in Scots.
24226540	24229540	But he, like, wasn't Scottish.
24229540	24233540	So he just wrote what he thought, like, Scottish folks said.
24233540	24235540	And it was just complete gibberish.
24235540	24238540	And he'd been doing it for ages and no one, like, caught him.
24238540	24240540	Wasn't that it?
24241540	24245540	He sent in Zillow to Scotland to find an affordable hoose, honestly.
24247540	24248540	It's Gallus!
24248540	24249540	Hello.
24249540	24251540	Hello, Gallus.
24258540	24260540	I visited Edinburgh.
24260540	24261540	Let's go.
24261540	24263540	I'd asked the same question.
24264540	24265540	That's really funny.
24265540	24268540	Stony's gonna buy a castle, move the wheeler team into it,
24268540	24270540	then get Reeflands to serve them there.
24270540	24272540	But could you imagine, though?
24272540	24273540	Like, oh!
24273540	24276540	You know what, you get out of this exchange?
24276540	24278540	A servitude!
24281540	24283540	How are you to blame?
24290540	24292540	Where can I say no?
24294540	24297540	Wait a minute, you're Gallus!
24303540	24306540	I'm best pals with your girlfriend.
24313540	24315540	How do you say I love you in Scottish?
24315540	24317540	It's just I love you.
24318540	24322540	Like, I love you, and then I love you.
24323540	24326540	It's kind of, like, shoved together in fast.
24326540	24328540	He's that adoring fan.
24328540	24329540	Is he?
24330540	24332540	By Azura, by Azura, by Azura.
24332540	24334540	I did this for Nocturo.
24334540	24336540	I did this for the honour of the guild.
24341540	24343540	Carlaya helped me.
24345540	24347540	Yes, your girlfriend's alive.
24353540	24355540	Well, then she would have appeared here.
24355540	24358540	Then take the key and right all the wrongs.
24364540	24366540	When we put Stony as our cult leader,
24366540	24368540	we could cut taxes and save money!
24368540	24369540	Yay!
24371540	24373540	We can be tax exempt together.
24373540	24374540	Yippee!
24375540	24377540	How can a spirit die?
24384540	24386540	The Ebeneer?
24386540	24388540	A bit of Ebeneer?
24395540	24399540	Maintaining a historical site for tax breaks and profit?
24399540	24402540	Yeah, and then we run like a massive B&B over.
24402540	24403540	Oh my god.
24404540	24406540	I'm afraid so.
24406540	24407540	I'm weakening.
24407540	24410540	And I can feel myself slipping away.
24410540	24412540	The gears without restoration of my power
24412540	24413540	I had to take.
24413540	24414540	That's taken.
24414540	24416540	You really want to mess with the IRS?
24416540	24418540	That should be a song.
24418540	24420540	You really want to mess with the IRS?
24421540	24425540	I fought the law in the law one.
24425540	24427540	Ray.
24429540	24430540	Good luck, Gallus.
24430540	24432540	Even though you don't have to do anything.
24433540	24435540	I don't mind doing the hard work, right?
24435540	24436540	Who needs a bashing?
24437540	24438540	Who needs a bashing?
24438540	24439540	Who's begging for the pagan?
24439540	24440540	Because it's all happening at once.
24440540	24441540	Let's go!
24441540	24442540	I bet he do.
24443540	24444540	Beat him up! Beat him up! Beat him up!
24444540	24445540	Beat him up! Beat him up!
24447540	24449540	Oh wow, they're actually kind of beef.
24450540	24453540	They're actually a bit stronger than your average enemy.
24453540	24454540	Hold on a minute.
24454540	24455540	I don't like that.
24456540	24457540	You, come here.
24457540	24458540	No, I'm stuck on the stairs.
24458540	24459540	Hold on.
24459540	24460540	I'm stuck on...
24461540	24462540	I'm stuck on...
24462540	24463540	Ow! Ow! Stop!
24463540	24465540	Swap to weapon, Ray!
24465540	24466540	Stop to melee!
24466540	24467540	Yes, there you go.
24467540	24468540	Okay, there we go.
24468540	24470540	Jeez, I lose.
24471540	24472540	What is in you?
24473540	24474540	Arrows?
24475540	24476540	So, Jim!
24477540	24478540	Alchemy.
24480540	24483540	Totally not secret backtracking.
24483540	24485540	I do love Skyrim for that.
24485540	24487540	It's quite rather entertaining.
24487540	24491540	Okay, they've got elven arrows on their persons, which is pretty...
24495540	24497540	Oh, why are you so scary?
24500540	24501540	I'm not gonna lie.
24501540	24503540	Like, they're kind of messing me up now.
24504540	24506540	Open our own velar colony?
24507540	24508540	What?
24508540	24512540	In the Scottish countryside with crops and feudal lordship for the grove?
24512540	24513540	Bruh!
24515540	24518540	Look, sometimes a sense of community is all you need if...
24518540	24519540	Oh!
24519540	24521540	Wait, I'm to stay in the dark.
24522540	24525540	Right, if you stay in the dark, your health doesn't get...
24528540	24530540	Well, wasn't he paying attention to that?
24530540	24531540	Was he?
24531540	24532540	Clearly, no.
24533540	24536540	Yeah, you just need to stay in the dark so you don't get hurt in this section.
24536540	24538540	It's not really too bad at all.
24538540	24540540	I just can't see nothing in it at all.
24541540	24542540	Oh!
24542540	24545540	Just a wee bit of poison, just a few darts in my eyeballs.
24545540	24546540	It's fine, it's fine.
24546540	24548540	I can still see for the most part.
24549540	24550540	Wish I wore my glasses.
24558540	24559540	My lady!
24560540	24561540	Hello!
24562540	24565540	Oh, a bandit got all the way here.
24566540	24567540	Hello, my lady!
24567540	24570540	Please ignore the fact that I'm taking your offering.
24570540	24572540	So fragmented, I don't need that.
24573540	24576540	Uh, uh, behind here is two chains to pull.
24577540	24578540	Gammy!
24580540	24581540	Atlas!
24582540	24583540	Where's Blossom?
24584540	24585540	Where's Gammy?
24585540	24589540	That's Gammy, the girl, and that's her dad, Atlas.
24589540	24591540	And Blossom's her mummy.
24592540	24593540	Hmm.
24593540	24595540	Is it true if you buy land in Skull, you become a lord?
24595540	24598540	No, that is completely false.
24598540	24603540	Um, if you take that in, by the way, you'll actually...
24604540	24605540	Um...
24609540	24610540	I knew...
24610540	24612540	Ow!
24612540	24614540	Oh my god, I just got reeled by a log.
24614540	24616540	That wasn't really that fun, I'm gonna be honest.
24618540	24619540	Wait, we did it, we did it.
24619540	24620540	We're here, we're here.
24620540	24622540	Snowberry's waiting on Icey's every need,
24622540	24624540	Penpal's being picked for a set of me.
24627540	24630540	Oh, it's all spooky, it's all spooky and purple.
24632540	24634540	Oh, I love the color scheme.
24636540	24638540	Oh, I remember this.
24641540	24643540	Oh no, I'm stuck.
24645540	24646540	I should read his note.
24647540	24648540	Anderson's...
24648540	24649540	Anderson's message.
24667540	24668540	I don't think he made it, chief.
24668540	24669540	I don't think he made it.
24669540	24670540	Yeah.
24671540	24672540	Uh...
24673540	24675540	If only we had some sort of...
24676540	24677540	Key?
24678540	24681540	Some sort of skeleton...
24682540	24683540	Key?
24683540	24684540	Yep.
24698540	24699540	Oh, I'm stuck.
24700540	24701540	I got...
24706540	24707540	Oh, that's...
24707540	24708540	Gammies!
24708540	24710540	Look at all Gammie's babies!
24710540	24711540	Oh, I'm in the wrong way.
24711540	24712540	Sorry, Hen.
24717540	24720540	Tell me that ain't good design.
24721540	24724540	Excuse me, we'll stay a little around.
24725540	24726540	Oh yeah.
24726540	24727540	Yeah.
24728540	24729540	Oh yeah.
24736540	24737540	Oh yeah.
24749540	24752540	Nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.
24753540	24756540	We must stay focused, Reeflings.
24756540	24758540	We must stay focused.
24783540	24784540	Oh no.
24788540	24789540	Wow!
24789540	24790540	Drink?
24800540	24801540	Bye-bye, mommy!
24801540	24802540	Bye-bye, mommy!
24808540	24810540	Where did you come from?
24810540	24811540	Hello.
24811540	24812540	Oh, sorry.
24813540	24814540	Oh, sorry.
24814540	24815540	Oh, sorry.
24816540	24817540	Can I talk to you now?
24819540	24820540	Yes.
24823540	24826540	Uh, please, she sounded indifferent.
24842540	24848540	What's this about becoming an agent and a nocturnal?
24853540	24854540	What?
24857540	24858540	Present moon?
24858540	24860540	I think is what we want.
24860540	24863540	A full moon for the agent of strife.
24864540	24867540	This is nocturnal's role in maintaining balance.
24868540	24872540	How is this goddess of stealth when it's clear?
24872540	24873540	Ha!
24873540	24878540	The clap of her cheeks would alarm the guards on a 500 meter radius.
24880540	24881540	It's unfamiliar.
24881540	24883540	Her hotness is so powerful.
24888540	24889540	And you?
24891540	24892540	Aw.
24895540	24896540	The beginning of what?
24904540	24905540	Wow.
24910540	24912540	They're not good at what we do.
24914540	24915540	Uh, I think stealth.
24915540	24917540	Tell me about the present, then.
24920540	24921540	Yeah, okay.
24921540	24923540	Well, you do the agent of...
24924540	24926540	Are you a crescent moon?
24926540	24928540	You're a full moon.
24928540	24929540	And you're a half moon.
24929540	24930540	Okay, crescent moon.
24932540	24933540	Hee-hee.
24933540	24934540	Okay, now what?
24935540	24936540	Oh, no.
24936540	24937540	Gallus is about to come...
24940540	24943540	Ooh, look, it's Gallus and Karnaya.
24943540	24945540	They're gonna kiss.
24950540	24951540	Come like the others.
24952540	24955540	If it were not for the actions of this knight in the air,
24955540	24958540	what the years would have come through.
24958540	24961540	She would have just lost all of it.
24961540	24963540	You do now, my love.
24964540	24967540	Nocturnal calls me to the Everglow.
24967540	24970540	My contract has been fulfilled.
24971540	24973540	When I ever see you again.
24973540	24976540	When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid,
24976540	24978540	we'll embrace what's there.
24978540	24979540	Aww.
24985540	24987540	I've been 25 years since you've seen each other,
24987540	24988540	and this is it.
24988540	24990540	This is what they muster.
24991540	24992540	Are you alright, Karnaya?
24992540	24993540	Maybe it's just not...
24993540	24995540	It shouldn't understand.
24996540	24998540	Oh, he's going to disappear into the bowl of soup.
24998540	25000540	Oh, he's in the bowl of soup, lads.
25000540	25003540	Sorry, I'm sure it's really emotional.
25004540	25007540	Where did Gallus go in a bowl of soup?
25009540	25012540	The spirit becomes one with the Everglow.
25015540	25016540	Ah.
25016540	25018540	So he's gone?
25022540	25023540	Okay.
25025540	25028540	You drank the ghost soup, honestly.
25031540	25034540	They're a part of the darkness around us?
25039540	25042540	Oh, they're so cool.
25054540	25057540	Oh, I'm getting it now.
25057540	25059540	How will I know if I'm needed here?
25062540	25063540	Okay.
25068540	25070540	Use it whenever you wish.
25071540	25072540	Okay.
25074540	25075540	Where will you be?
25075540	25078540	I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall.
25078540	25080540	Since it's your home as well,
25080540	25082540	I hope to see you and Brynjolf there.
25083540	25086540	Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities too.
25086540	25089540	The quiet thing is from time to time.
25089540	25091540	Can't afford to get rusty now, can we?
25092540	25093540	Well, I'm...
25093540	25095540	I'm satisfied.
25096540	25098540	Yeah, yeah, bye-bye. Okay, thank you.
25099540	25100540	Thank you, hubby-bee.
25100540	25102540	Is this your home now?
25102540	25103540	It is!
25103540	25105540	Okay, so she just hangs out here now.
25105540	25107540	Girl, that's a bit depressive.
25107540	25109540	But anyway, that's all new.
25109540	25111540	As long as you're having a good time and all that.
25111540	25115540	Thanks for the experience of being in Nightingale.
25116540	25118540	Alright, have a good night and good luck.
25118540	25119540	Thank you!
25119540	25121540	For those of you who need to go rest, please do rest.
25121540	25124540	I am literally farting about, um...
25125540	25127540	Cause...
25127540	25130540	Mercy is going live in two hours.
25130540	25132540	I'm gonna redirect into her,
25132540	25134540	and then it means I can...
25134540	25136540	do a little bit of...
25136540	25140540	a little bit of preparation for my monetization stream tomorrow.
25140540	25142540	I'll need to actually make the thumbnail,
25142540	25144540	and you get a picture of my frickin' feet for the thumbnail.
25144540	25145540	Omega at low.
25147540	25149540	Oh no, what did I do now?
25150540	25152540	Well, we do...
25152540	25153540	Night...
25153540	25156540	Night mother, night mother, send your child unto me for...
25156540	25157540	Oh no, sweet mother.
25157540	25159540	I keep saying night mother.
25159540	25161540	Apparently...
25161540	25163540	it's sweet mother.
25163540	25166540	I could've sworn I turned that on.
25166540	25167540	Man, there we go.
25167540	25169540	Yeah.
25169540	25172540	Group brushing, T-minus 90 minutes, yes.
25172540	25173540	Um, right.
25173540	25175540	I am going to make a cup of tea
25175540	25177540	if we would all like to get something to hydrate.
25177540	25179540	Gotta go to Winterhold for that one.
25179540	25180540	Yes.
25180540	25183540	I'm gonna make a cup of tea,
25183540	25185540	and then...
25185540	25186540	we will...
25186540	25189540	see how far we can get on the Dark Brotherhood.
25189540	25191540	There's absolutely no way in heck
25191540	25194540	we are getting anywhere close to it.
25194540	25196540	Um...
25196540	25197540	But...
25197540	25199540	it doesn't mean we can't start it.
25199540	25200540	Okay, man.
25200540	25202540	I'll arrive late for tomorrow's stream,
25202540	25203540	cause I'll be at work.
25203540	25205540	It's a very short stream tomorrow.
25205540	25207540	It's not Skyrim Part 2.
25207540	25209540	Just, uh...
25209540	25211540	for those of you who may be lurking,
25211540	25213540	there is not a Skyrim Part 2 tomorrow,
25213540	25215540	cause I've completely messed up the achievements,
25215540	25218540	and the whole point was to do the achievements,
25218540	25220540	um...
25220540	25222540	and for some reason they're not working,
25222540	25224540	even though I am on Xbox Game Pass.
25224540	25225540	Um...
25225540	25227540	But we do have plenty of time in the future.
25227540	25229540	I will definitely come back to Skyrim
25229540	25231540	once I've fixed whatever's going on.
25231540	25233540	Cause honestly, I'm like,
25233540	25235540	I should have just played cameo.
25235540	25237540	Um...
25239540	25241540	Sorry, we need to break in here
25241540	25243540	so we can go talk to this kid.
25243540	25245540	Sweet mother, sweet mother,
25245540	25247540	send your child unto me
25247540	25249540	for this soon.
25249540	25251540	Very tired.
25251540	25253540	Oh no.
25253540	25255540	Sweet mother, sweet mother,
25255540	25257540	send your child unto me.
25257540	25259540	Send your child unto me.
25261540	25263540	So you come in.
25263540	25265540	How long must I do this?
25265540	25267540	I keep praying, mother,
25267540	25269540	for I want you to answer me.
25269540	25271540	S.
25271540	25273540	You've come at last. I knew you would.
25273540	25275540	Are you alright?
25275540	25277540	I knew you'd come. I just knew it.
25277540	25279540	I did the Black Sacrament
25279540	25281540	over and over with the body
25281540	25283540	and the things that came
25283540	25285540	in a assassin from the Dark Brotherhood.
25285540	25287540	Uh...
25289540	25291540	Ah yes, the Black Sacrament
25291540	25293540	of course.
25293540	25295540	So long. So very long.
25295540	25297540	But now that you're here,
25297540	25299540	you can accept my contract.
25299540	25301540	Your contract?
25301540	25303540	My mother, she...
25303540	25305540	she died.
25305540	25307540	I'm all alone now.
25307540	25309540	So they sent me to the terrible orphanage
25309540	25311540	in Riften on her hall.
25311540	25313540	The headmistress is an evil cruel woman.
25313540	25315540	They call her Grelad the kind.
25315540	25317540	But she's not kind.
25317540	25319540	She's terrible to all of us.
25319540	25321540	So I ran away
25321540	25323540	and came home and performed
25323540	25325540	the Black Sacrament.
25325540	25327540	Now you're here and you can kill
25327540	25329540	Grelad the kind.
25329540	25331540	Ah...
25331540	25333540	Sure, buddy.
25335540	25337540	A kiss by the sweet mother.
25337540	25339540	What does the book say? Hand that book over.
25339540	25341540	So you wish to summon the Dark Brotherhood.
25341540	25343540	You wish to see someone dead.
25343540	25345540	Pray, child, pray,
25345540	25347540	and let the Night Mother hear your plea.
25347540	25349540	You must perform
25349540	25351540	that most profane of rituals,
25351540	25353540	the Black Sacrament.
25353540	25355540	Create an effigy
25355540	25357540	of the intended victim
25357540	25359540	assembled from actual body parts
25359540	25361540	including a heart, skull,
25361540	25363540	bones and flesh.
25363540	25365540	Encircle that effigy with candles.
25365540	25367540	The ritual itself must then commence.
25367540	25369540	Proceed to stab the effigy
25369540	25371540	repeatedly with a dagger.
25371540	25373540	Rubbed with the petals
25373540	25375540	of a nightshade plant
25375540	25377540	while whispering this plea.
25377540	25379540	Sweet mother, sweet mother,
25379540	25381540	send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy
25381540	25383540	must be baptized in blood and fear.
25383540	25385540	Then wait, child,
25385540	25387540	for the dread father
25387540	25389540	sithis rewards the patient.
25389540	25391540	You will be visited
25391540	25393540	by a representative of the Dark Brotherhood.
25393540	25395540	So begins
25395540	25397540	a contract bound in blood.
25397540	25399540	That's actually really cool.
25399540	25401540	Oh, I'm quite happy with that.
25401540	25403540	I quite like that kind of back
25403540	25405540	behind the scenes, not behind the scenes
25405540	25407540	because it's like hidden in a book so it's not behind the scenes.
25407540	25409540	But I like
25409540	25411540	seeing how the game like tried to
25411540	25413540	explain it.
25413540	25415540	It's a great thing. Where did he find
25415540	25417540	the body part? Oh, he tried his best, okay.
25417540	25419540	Probably went into the crypt
25419540	25421540	or something like that.
25421540	25423540	So this is probably the only
25423540	25425540	instance when you can
25425540	25427540	perish someone in front of a whole group
25427540	25429540	of people.
25429540	25431540	Sorry, hen.
25435540	25437540	Yeah, you do not get in trouble for doing
25437540	25439540	that. And all the kids
25441540	25443540	and they're like laughing
25443540	25445540	at our own stuff.
25445540	25447540	Wait, oh, I've gone the wrong way.
25447540	25449540	Sorry, I've gone the wrong way.
25449540	25451540	We're saved.
25453540	25455540	Yeah, literally
25455540	25457540	one of the only instances you can
25457540	25459540	walk in and perish someone and then come
25459540	25461540	straight back out again.
25461540	25463540	They don't care. No one cares.
25463540	25465540	The Riften Guards don't even care.
25465540	25467540	They must have known as well.
25467540	25469540	The actual nice lady takes over.
25469540	25471540	Yeah.
25471540	25473540	So really, we just did everyone a big old favor.
25473540	25475540	Okay.
25475540	25477540	I was like finding
25477540	25479540	different fun ways. Apparently you can cast
25479540	25481540	Friendsly in the Children
25481540	25483540	Parish Grail Oak. I'm not sure if that's true
25483540	25485540	or not.
25485540	25487540	Is she, you know,
25487540	25489540	kind of sounds like
25489540	25491540	Midoriya.
25491540	25493540	I knew you could do it.
25493540	25495540	I just knew it. I knew the Dark Brotherhood
25495540	25497540	would save me. Here, just like
25497540	25499540	I promised. This should bet you a nice
25499540	25501540	price. Thank you.
25501540	25503540	Thank you again.
25503540	25505540	What did you give me? Your child.
25505540	25507540	Completed Innocence Loss.
25509540	25511540	Family heirloom?
25511540	25513540	Oh, sorry, sorry.
25513540	25515540	My bad. I got a little...
25515540	25517540	I just needed to check what your family
25517540	25519540	heirloom was.
25519540	25521540	Is it any?
25521540	25523540	Oh, there is.
25523540	25525540	A plate? A plate.
25525540	25527540	I mean, you are a child, so I guess that makes
25527540	25529540	sense.
25529540	25531540	Now, if I remember correctly,
25531540	25533540	we need to go sleep in a bed.
25533540	25535540	Yeah, the first sleep
25535540	25537540	the poor Dragonborn has had since I started
25537540	25539540	my adventures.
25539540	25541540	So, we'll just rent a little bed in here.
25543540	25545540	You ever just accidentally dash across the house, honestly?
25547540	25549540	Oh, you. Hello.
25551540	25553540	Can you come a bit closer?
25553540	25555540	Okay, I guess not.
25555540	25557540	Yeah, I'd like to rent a room.
25557540	25559540	Thanks, darling.
25559540	25561540	Oh, okay.
25561540	25563540	Ten, ten stars.
25565540	25567540	Hello, my lady.
25567540	25569540	You want to join me?
25575540	25577540	Okay.
25579540	25581540	Right, please stop talking to me. I'm trying to be
25581540	25583540	sure in my room, but I'm having to help the NPC.
25583540	25585540	Okay, there we go. Thank you for showing me my room.
25587540	25589540	If you want the tip, just stay in the room.
25589540	25591540	We're getting that bed.
25591540	25593540	That's absolutely shocking behaviour.
25593540	25595540	Please stop.
25595540	25597540	Twelvers, we won't make a cup of tea very
25597540	25599540	shortly. I'm sorry.
25599540	25601540	I'm getting delirious.
25601540	25603540	Miss Droney, can I be excused from history
25603540	25605540	of the Nordic class to use the bathroom?
25605540	25607540	Yes, you're allowed to use the toilet.
25607540	25609540	Right, I am going
25609540	25611540	to go make a cup of tea.
25615540	25617540	What? Was that not supposed to be kidnapped?
25619540	25621540	Was that not supposed to be kidnapped?
25621540	25623540	After you perish?
25627540	25629540	Does it have to be about the island?
25635540	25637540	Huh.
25639540	25641540	Give her to her, kid.
25641540	25643540	It's after you receive a courier's lair.
25643540	25645540	Ah!
25645540	25647540	How are you streaming now? How are you so powerful?
25647540	25649540	That's...
25649540	25651540	It's called Othezam.
25651540	25653540	And I love my games.
25653540	25655540	Right, I'm waiting on the courier.
25655540	25657540	Courier, courier.
25657540	25659540	Courier, courier. Give me a letter.
25659540	25661540	Courier, my boss.
25661540	25663540	Right, ah, sorry.
25663540	25665540	I'm going to go get a cup of tea to recalibrate
25665540	25667540	because I have been playing for a hot second.
25667540	25669540	I'm going to have to pause the game
25669540	25671540	sadly because there can be NPC
25671540	25673540	events such as Coltas entering
25673540	25675540	the town which can kill NPCs.
25675540	25677540	So I will have it paused
25677540	25679540	whilst I go quickly make a cup of tea.
25679540	25681540	Please do
25681540	25683540	stretch your legs
25683540	25685540	and get yourself a wee water
25685540	25687540	and have a pee.
25689540	25691540	You got to sleep.
25691540	25693540	No.
25693540	25695540	Alright, sorry man.
25695540	25697540	I thought you had to sleep right away
25697540	25699540	but I need to receive the letter
25699540	25701540	with a hand that says we know and then go to sleep.
25701540	25703540	Okay?
25703540	25705540	I'm going to go get some water.
25705540	25707540	I'm going to get a cup of tea
25707540	25709540	and we're going to recalibrate and come back
25709540	25711540	and meet in the middle.
25711540	25713540	It will be a couple of minutes, okay?
25713540	25715540	I think I can get a wee snack
25715540	25717540	as well.
25717540	25719540	Right, beer, beer.
25733540	25735540	Thank you.
25763540	25765540	Thank you.
25793540	25795540	Thank you.
25823540	25825540	Thank you.
25853540	25855540	Thank you.
25883540	25885540	Thank you.
25913540	25915540	Thank you.
25943540	25945540	Thank you.
25973540	25975540	Thank you.
26003540	26005540	Thank you.
26033540	26035540	Thank you.
26063540	26065540	Thank you.
26093540	26095540	Welcome to Europe.
26095540	26097540	Wait, I said that wrong.
26097540	26099540	Welcome to Europe, young man.
26099540	26101540	Welcome to Europe.
26101540	26103540	Welcome to Europe.
26103540	26105540	Remember the 10 Eurovision?
26105540	26107540	Remember the 10 Eurovision?
26107540	26109540	Sorry.
26109540	26111540	I'm sorry.
26111540	26113540	I'm sorry.
26113540	26115540	I'm sorry.
26115540	26117540	I'm sorry.
26117540	26119540	I'm sorry.
26119540	26121540	I'm sorry.
26121540	26123540	Sorry, that was the worst Dutch
26123540	26125540	I think I've ever done so far.
26125540	26127540	I do apologize to any
26127540	26129540	Nederland mensen
26129540	26131540	who are listening in.
26131540	26133540	Everyone else is just like,
26133540	26135540	what on earth are you even on about?
26135540	26137540	Hi.
26137540	26139540	Welcome back.
26139540	26141540	What, you thought I was gone forever?
26141540	26143540	I've got me a cup of tea
26143540	26145540	and I've actually got stroepwafel.
26145540	26147540	I'm not even kidding.
26147540	26149540	I have actual stroepwafel.
26149540	26151540	On the rating stream
26151540	26153540	but I couldn't find any more
26153540	26155540	European snacks.
26155540	26157540	So I'm just literally going to
26157540	26159540	eat a little stroepwafel.
26161540	26163540	Welcome back.
26163540	26165540	I love stroepwafel.
26165540	26167540	It's like crack cocaine.
26167540	26169540	Sorry, but it's so good.
26171540	26173540	Yes, merci for the snippets
26173540	26175540	who are lurking.
26175540	26177540	I appreciate you even if I'm not your
26177540	26179540	flavor.
26179540	26181540	T minus one hour
26181540	26183540	and 40 minutes
26183540	26185540	until your
26185540	26187540	Kohai
26187540	26189540	is ready to say hi hi
26189540	26191540	and prove that
26191540	26193540	she can't whistle.
26193540	26195540	Which is adorable.
26195540	26197540	I can't believe that I hired her on the basis she can't
26197540	26199540	whistle. Stop leaving
26199540	26201540	I'm not allowed to go get a cup
26201540	26203540	of tea for my
26203540	26205540	boys.
26205540	26207540	Are you like hearing my words?
26207540	26209540	Are you ending
26209540	26211540	when merci comes on?
26211540	26213540	Yes, I'm going to redirect into her on purpose
26213540	26215540	because
26215540	26217540	I didn't know I was getting monetization
26217540	26219540	today.
26219540	26221540	So tomorrow we're doing the monetization
26221540	26223540	celebration.
26223540	26225540	So I need to set up
26225540	26227540	all the emotes and I need to set up on the
26227540	26229540	price.
26229540	26231540	And I think very sadly I have to
26231540	26233540	charge more than 4.99
26233540	26235540	US dollars.
26235540	26237540	But I think I might have to
26237540	26239540	because of this YouTube gifting
26239540	26241540	stuff.
26241540	26243540	Can any of yous confirm that
26243540	26245540	YouTube gifting thing is a nightmare
26245540	26247540	or a hassle?
26247540	26249540	I'm going to take a bite of my waffle
26249540	26251540	okay?
26251540	26253540	Mmm.
26261540	26263540	I know it's only like 2 cents
26263540	26265540	difference. I just don't like that.
26265540	26267540	Hold on.
26267540	26269540	I'm going to
26269540	26271540	check out
26271540	26273540	Marshmallows
26273540	26275540	if you'd like to send me any marshmallows
26275540	26277540	I'm just going to take a quick pause champ
26277540	26279540	on top of everything.
26279540	26281540	Jesus Christ
26281540	26283540	why do I have so many DMs?
26285540	26287540	Okay
26287540	26289540	I don't know
26289540	26291540	for the most part.
26291540	26293540	Oh and now I can't see my mouse again.
26295540	26297540	Okay marshmallow refresh
26297540	26299540	let's go.
26301540	26303540	A lot of follow girls
26303540	26305540	have 1.99 tier and then 4.99
26305540	26307540	and the gift goes to the 4.99
26307540	26309540	Ah
26311540	26313540	I'm at exactly $5 work
26313540	26315540	I possibly
26325540	26327540	Hello mommy
26327540	26329540	you're asking what software baby uses
26329540	26331540	for 3D is called
26331540	26333540	Warudo
26333540	26335540	for full body tracking there's a lot of videos
26335540	26337540	about it but I think most YouTubers use
26337540	26339540	Sony mo copy
26339540	26341540	Slime VR
26341540	26343540	or Vine trackers
26343540	26345540	okay okay
26345540	26347540	It's okay mommy
26347540	26349540	I know you can't open my last Mario link
26349540	26351540	on stream don't
26351540	26353540	forget to check later
26353540	26355540	Is it bad that I check?
26355540	26357540	As soon as I go offline
26357540	26359540	I just spend like another 30 minutes
26359540	26361540	and I'm like yeah
26365540	26367540	what's the problem with gifting
26367540	26369540	so the issue is
26369540	26371540	if someone is very kind to gift
26371540	26373540	but they can't dictate
26373540	26375540	what type of tier to give
26375540	26377540	it means
26377540	26379540	outsiders isn't a nice term to use
26379540	26381540	that's not the correct term
26381540	26383540	but someone who
26383540	26385540	maybe
26387540	26389540	what's the word?
26389540	26391540	I'm trying to think
26391540	26393540	someone who
26395540	26397540	gets access to membership streams that
26397540	26399540	like should name
26399540	26401540	you know like
26401540	26403540	someone who's just gonna be
26403540	26405540	rude about it or whatever
26405540	26407540	I don't know
26409540	26411540	yeah use whatever
26411540	26413540	it's better to have people
26413540	26415540	watching the membership streams that are
26415540	26417540	actually interested
26417540	26419540	because someone might get a
26419540	26421540	message and it's like
26421540	26423540	oh right okay
26425540	26427540	that's chicken
26429540	26431540	you might be able to turn on gifting
26431540	26433540	entirely well the problem is gifting
26433540	26435540	is a massive money source for the girls
26439540	26441540	if someone's gonna be
26441540	26443540	a shitter and members content
26443540	26445540	they better be paying out their own pocket
26445540	26447540	that's so funny I'm sorry
26447540	26449540	but that's actually such a funny statement
26451540	26453540	okay scrawny and fellow reeflings
26453540	26455540	I'm gonna have
26455540	26457540	a fun rest of the stream
26457540	26459540	oh now I need to go sorry
26459540	26461540	words are blending together
26461540	26463540	I'll see you tomorrow yes
26463540	26465540	I think it'll be roughly
26465540	26467540	2 hours
26467540	26469540	it's a short stream tomorrow do apologize
26469540	26471540	but I'm needing overall vocal rest
26471540	26473540	I've got quite a few vtuber ASMR collabs
26473540	26475540	coming up so
26475540	26477540	I'm needing to be a good girl and rest
26477540	26479540	and try my best
26479540	26481540	I am a Spanish reefling
26481540	26483540	and I've been very
26483540	26485540	no you've not
26487540	26489540	hold on
26489540	26491540	you've helped me pass some hard time
26491540	26493540	so I just want to know that
26493540	26495540	if you're really proud of you and the way your streams go
26495540	26497540	also
26497540	26499540	I like how you act
26499540	26501540	on stream
26501540	26503540	about gapping and ranking burps is fun
26505540	26507540	what is
26507540	26509540	what do you want in Spanish
26509540	26511540	in English
26511540	26513540	for me
26513540	26515540	because I don't know what
26515540	26517540	what do you want
26517540	26519540	I think it means
26519540	26521540	I don't even know
26525540	26527540	you are truly an anomaly
26527540	26529540	I've never seen someone who is
26529540	26531540	so intensely thoughtful
26531540	26533540	and caring about both
26533540	26535540	your daughters and reeflings
26535540	26537540	also shameless
26537540	26539540	hold on
26539540	26541540	what am I getting spanked by
26541540	26543540	it's a level of
26543540	26545540	authenticity
26545540	26547540	I would never
26547540	26549540	even see in a person let alone a vtuber
26549540	26551540	I wish you all the success in the world
26551540	26553540	wow
26553540	26555540	you did an absolutely fantastic job
26555540	26557540	on the tryharding in the ASMR stream
26557540	26559540	I can only assume you have a really good coach
26559540	26561540	since it took me over a year to study to get to that level
26561540	26563540	a coach
26563540	26565540	like a hypno coach
26565540	26567540	no
26567540	26569540	that's just called autism
26569540	26571540	and general interest
26571540	26573540	I just apply what I like to whatever
26573540	26575540	and I do it my
26575540	26577540	also it's something I would never do otherwise
26577540	26579540	but my
26579540	26581540	but my girlfriend
26581540	26583540	has convinced me I should
26583540	26585540	do bibbutes
26585540	26587540	so I printed out 21 pages
26587540	26589540	so I can build some
26589540	26591540	additional cognitive habits
26591540	26593540	at the end of the month
26593540	26595540	what is this
26603540	26605540	what is this
26605540	26607540	what is this
26607540	26609540	what is this
26609540	26611540	additional cognitive habits
26611540	26613540	what is this
26615540	26617540	21 bibbutes for me
26617540	26619540	for me
26619540	26621540	right now
26621540	26623540	it's almost 5am
26623540	26625540	yes please rest well
26625540	26627540	for those of you who are hanging on by a thread
26627540	26629540	we're
26629540	26631540	just going to start off the dark brotherhood
26631540	26633540	at this point
26633540	26635540	I'm going to see if I can fix achievements
26635540	26637540	and possibly we can come back to Skyrim
26637540	26639540	but tomorrow is being steamrolled
26639540	26641540	by monetization celebration stream
26641540	26643540	go get those

26663540	26665540	where is it

26683540	26685540	I can't really
26685540	26687540	can't really get away with it too much
26687540	26689540	let's behave
26691540	26693540	a tomato a day keeps your bars okay
26693540	26695540	yes that is our new slogan
26695540	26697540	ladies and gentlemen

26733540	26735540	about Assassin's Creed and how amazing it is

26759540	26761540	I most certainly will check that out
26761540	26763540	I may have in another life thought I was
26763540	26765540	about to play it and then play the complete
26765540	26767540	wrong game which was called Helltaker I believe
26767540	26769540	and it was also a puzzle game and
26769540	26771540	I was so confused on why the game
26771540	26773540	looked so different to what I was playing
26773540	26775540	and it turns out I was playing the completely wrong
26775540	26777540	game but yes I would
26777540	26779540	love to give Valhalla a try
26779540	26781540	hi cuttles are Mondays and Tuesdays

26811540	26813540	I know you were wondering how to pronounce
26813540	26815540	my name earlier and you had
26815540	26817540	it right as spiny is pronounced
26817540	26819540	like a spiny anteater
26821540	26823540	I'm going to be so honest
26823540	26825540	Brian did not help with my confusion
26825540	26827540	on the pronunciation of your name
26827540	26829540	tiny spiny
26829540	26831540	what
26831540	26833540	and you had it right as spiny
26833540	26835540	is pronounced pronounced like a spiny
26835540	26837540	anteater a spiny
26837540	26839540	anteater or a
26839540	26841540	spiny anteater
26843540	26845540	Brian just made that 10
26845540	26847540	times worse and I do apologize if I'm
26847540	26849540	now officially butchering it but thank you for the tip
26849540	26851540	do it
26851540	26853540	phonetically in chat like
26853540	26855540	right so it's either
26855540	26857540	spiny
26857540	26859540	or did I even
26859540	26861540	spiny
26861540	26863540	so you know
26863540	26865540	spain
26865540	26867540	e okay
26867540	26869540	spiny
26869540	26871540	we got there in the end
26871540	26873540	literally I'm renaming everyone who
26873540	26875540	who just doesn't have an easy to rename
26875540	26877540	for me
26877540	26879540	spiny
26879540	26881540	there are
26881540	26883540	Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday
26883540	26885540	endurance streams yes
26885540	26887540	um most of the stream sniping
26887540	26889540	I'm trying to do for like a big amount
26889540	26891540	of time because I know not everyone's available
26891540	26893540	right at the one
26893540	26895540	time zone if you will
26895540	26897540	uh
26897540	26899540	yeah
26901540	26903540	having you you have about developmental
26903540	26905540	psychology and socially
26905540	26907540	inculcated
26907540	26909540	reactions
26909540	26911540	to stress maybe realize I really wish that physical
26911540	26913540	touch and infection was more normalized in society
26913540	26915540	especially for men male socialized people
26915540	26917540	people need more hugs easy also
26917540	26919540	I'm curious how you deal with the stress and she mentioned
26919540	26921540	you don't know how we do it
26921540	26923540	um
26923540	26925540	I always
26925540	26927540	have a goal or something to work towards
26927540	26929540	which helps distract me
26929540	26931540	from what I'm feeling in the moment
26931540	26933540	and essentially makes me like numb
26933540	26935540	and work through it
26935540	26937540	so like right now my goal is to help the girls
26937540	26939540	achieve what they want
26939540	26941540	so I'm like even though
26941540	26943540	I'm stressed
26943540	26945540	and I'm worried and I'm this and I'm
26945540	26947540	that because
26947540	26949540	they are a much more important
26949540	26951540	focus on my life
26951540	26953540	it's kind of one of those things where I can
26953540	26955540	just put it to the side for now
26955540	26957540	and right okay
26957540	26959540	what's next once I get
26959540	26961540	offline I have some lovely VTubers
26961540	26963540	who are waiting on an ASMR collab from me
26963540	26965540	I have to send away shorts
26965540	26967540	for the girls I need to record that for them
26967540	26969540	um
26969540	26971540	like I need to do
26971540	26973540	um
26973540	26975540	yeah
26975540	26977540	um
26977540	26979540	every word is hard
26979540	26981540	to pronounce if you're bad enough for example
26981540	26983540	I pronounce spatula spatula
26983540	26985540	honestly
26985540	26987540	I think having
26987540	26989540	a purpose is really useful
26989540	26991540	in general yes I agree with that
26991540	26993540	I also do it that way
26993540	26995540	it's so tough to tackle
26995540	26997540	like men's socialization
26997540	26999540	because
26999540	27001540	where does it start it starts in the
27001540	27003540	home but then where
27003540	27005540	does it get affected
27005540	27007540	secondary socialization at school
27007540	27009540	like I don't know if you guys had this
27009540	27011540	but in Scotland
27011540	27013540	um
27013540	27015540	like
27015540	27017540	it became so quickly oh that's gay
27017540	27019540	to show any affection
27019540	27021540	in any sense in a basic
27021540	27023540	hug a basic handshake
27023540	27025540	um rubbing shoulders
27025540	27027540	against each other if you're both
27027540	27029540	you get you get and it starts
27029540	27031540	from there and then that isolation
27031540	27033540	progresses
27033540	27035540	further and further to the point
27035540	27037540	where the most
27037540	27039540	natural thing which is a reassuring
27039540	27041540	hug or embrace when you meet someone
27041540	27043540	you know um
27043540	27045540	becomes this almost
27045540	27047540	taboo unfamiliar
27047540	27049540	territory um
27049540	27051540	and it is such a shame that you even have
27051540	27053540	to experience that because
27053540	27055540	of the secondary socialization
27055540	27057540	because your primary socialization which is your family
27057540	27059540	um
27059540	27061540	you know I bet your dad came home and you gave him
27061540	27063540	a big hug like oh dad
27063540	27065540	and when you went and visited your grandparents
27065540	27067540	oh granddad grand
27067540	27069540	and gave him a wee kiss and a wee hug and all that
27069540	27071540	and it all goes out
27071540	27073540	the window because of
27073540	27075540	secondary socialization
27075540	27077540	yet behind closed doors
27077540	27079540	behind closed doors behind
27079540	27081540	in families perfectly normal
27081540	27083540	absolutely normal behavior
27083540	27085540	and it's very frustrating
27085540	27087540	because
27087540	27089540	to even think of how to
27089540	27091540	tackle it where do you
27091540	27093540	even start
27093540	27095540	because the way
27095540	27097540	it's set up is it's your
27097540	27099540	fault on an individual
27099540	27101540	level that you can
27101540	27103540	do these things that you can't hug
27103540	27105540	your bro that you get you meet up with once a month
27105540	27107540	um you can
27107540	27109540	it's your fault
27109540	27111540	because you didn't keep up
27111540	27113540	with that societal norm you
27113540	27115540	didn't break the more you like see how
27115540	27117540	it's so hard to break from society's grasp
27117540	27119540	at that point
27119540	27121540	someone says how's the game going
27121540	27123540	I'm so sorry I'm currently in a rant
27123540	27125540	about the social
27125540	27127540	um
27127540	27129540	education that you get after
27129540	27131540	sorry I'm fricking going on a rant again I can't
27131540	27133540	I can't stop myself
27133540	27135540	it's fascinating stuff when you start to really
27135540	27137540	break it down it becomes
27137540	27139540	almost frustrating
27139540	27141540	when you realize how bare bones
27141540	27143540	and simplistic humans are in nature
27143540	27145540	and yet we are
27145540	27147540	sorry I'm burping away
27147540	27149540	we are our own biggest enemies
27149540	27151540	we live in a society

27227540	27229540	um
27229540	27231540	my ideas are quite
27231540	27233540	alienating
27233540	27235540	as much as we were meming on needy streamer overload
27235540	27237540	um
27237540	27239540	my

27243540	27245540	but yeah I'm thinking you're never know
27245540	27247540	I plan on writing
27247540	27249540	a fairly long
27249540	27251540	fantasy of mine
27251540	27253540	I've had of you it's still cringe I want to

27273540	27275540	you're a Pippa
27277540	27279540	I'm like I'm probably
27279540	27281540	1984 dystopian
27281540	27283540	type
27283540	27285540	allegations
27285540	27287540	I don't know what
27287540	27289540	Pippa's field is in particular
27289540	27291540	but I am dystopian
27291540	27293540	based like whatever horrors of
27293540	27295540	man-made comprehension you can think of
27295540	27297540	have occurred
27297540	27299540	you know I'm like that kind of side of things
27299540	27301540	can you see

27349540	27351540	well

27353540	27355540	of the requirements of a conspiracy theorist
27355540	27357540	eh I'm afraid that yes
27357540	27359540	our planet is in fact
27359540	27361540	around, oh dear
27361540	27363540	very controversial I know

27389540	27391540	a certain year
27391540	27393540	was kind of scrubbed on a mass level
27393540	27395540	is so people realise
27395540	27397540	eh people don't know that
27397540	27399540	in a few hundred years I try to get a sense of that
27399540	27401540	we live in a society
27401540	27403540	where I go into the darkest and most remote
27403540	27405540	German forest and someone
27405540	27407540	still reports me because I pee
27407540	27409540	against a tree
27409540	27411540	true iron reaver true
27411540	27413540	right imagine burning books

27437540	27439540	ah

27473540	27475540	it's embarrassing I assure you
27475540	27477540	the person who is doing the ultrasound
27477540	27479540	on your boss act has already
27479540	27481540	looked at about 10 sacks
27481540	27483540	that day already and within

27529540	27531540	completely benign like

27607540	27609540	having like a
27611540	27613540	they're not dry put it that way
27613540	27615540	most guys hands are like dry so
27615540	27617540	when you go like when you
27617540	27619540	rub your hands together it's like
27619540	27621540	but when I rub my hands well when I put
27621540	27623540	my hands together I can fart with my hands
27623540	27625540	because they're always
27625540	27627540	clammy and wet and yeah
27627540	27629540	that's very true
27629540	27631540	I can always do that
27631540	27633540	do it on command
27633540	27635540	I can never find this emote it's called flushed
27635540	27637540	that emote is called flushed
27637540	27639540	I can do that
27639540	27641540	breathe it in lads and lasses
27641540	27643540	well you are a cuddle fish I'd be concerned
27643540	27645540	if you were tonight you're so talented
27645540	27647540	sweaty hands aren't fun
27647540	27649540	it's a little bit annoying especially
27649540	27651540	gaming with a controller
27651540	27653540	because of the heat
27653540	27655540	transfer it reflects straight back
27655540	27657540	when I'm using a controller
27657540	27659540	fart hands being
27659540	27661540	when your hands are dry just hold
27661540	27663540	shiny I will I have
27663540	27665540	enough sweat to make your hands
27665540	27667540	nice and soft as well okay
27667540	27669540	there's enough to go around I assure you
27677540	27679540	but yeah
27681540	27683540	don't read this out loud
27687540	27689540	oh my god I'm getting intel
27689540	27691540	I'm getting intel
27691540	27693540	I know you said
27693540	27695540	you wouldn't ever approach other v-tubers
27695540	27697540	but considering the similarity of line of work
27697540	27699540	would you ever consider a collab with project melody
27699540	27701540	both of you seem very knowledgeable
27701540	27703540	and passionate about
27703540	27705540	positive A in education mental health
27705540	27707540	I feel like you would be great for us
27709540	27711540	I would never say no
27711540	27713540	but at this point in time
27715540	27717540	I'm just going to focus on getting the girls
27717540	27719540	their achievements stuff
27719540	27721540	I would never say no
27721540	27723540	but to reach out is quite
27723540	27725540	daunting
27725540	27727540	I'm sure anyone can kind of relate to that kind of thing
27731540	27733540	I would never say no
27733540	27735540	I've just said that
27735540	27737540	main project melody seems to be
27737540	27739540	like opposites
27739540	27741540	and yet the same type thing
27741540	27743540	with our kind of care and all that jazz
27743540	27745540	reefling intelligent agency
27745540	27747540	since you have hyper hydrolysis
27747540	27749540	do you keep yourself well hydrated
27749540	27751540	the way that I can tell
27751540	27753540	I'm actually severely dehydrated
27753540	27755540	as my hands go dry
27755540	27757540	that's when I know
27757540	27759540	I'm like up S Creek
27759540	27761540	basically as if my hands stop
27761540	27763540	my feet will never stop
27763540	27765540	I have never been aware of my feet
27765540	27767540	stopping sweating
27767540	27769540	lucky me
27769540	27771540	I was always so embarrassed
27771540	27773540	and as well I don't know if you guys have school dance
27773540	27775540	but I used to like
27775540	27777540	rub my hands on my trousers
27777540	27779540	like really quickly before I like
27779540	27781540	and I'm sure I bet you my dance partner
27781540	27783540	like whoever you got on the day
27783540	27785540	felt like I was doing it on purpose
27785540	27787540	like oh boy
27787540	27789540	and it's like no I have a really bad sweat problem
27789540	27791540	I don't want anyone to know about it
27791540	27793540	he he
27793540	27795540	she's just like me for real
27795540	27797540	for real
27797540	27799540	melody is dark and wholesome
27799540	27801540	yet darkly lewd
27801540	27803540	you're nerdy and yappy and intensively lewd
27805540	27807540	through the sneak
27807540	27809540	I've never been to a school dance
27809540	27811540	oh I guess maybe
27811540	27813540	not every country does it
27813540	27815540	but we had to learn like
27815540	27817540	Scottish traditional dance like the gay garden
27817540	27819540	did you say the gay garden
27819540	27821540	yes gay isn't happy ha ha ha we get it
27821540	27823540	we're
27823540	27825540	called gay garden
27825540	27827540	which means happy dance
27827540	27829540	never been to a school dance can't relate
27831540	27833540	I have hyperdologists too
27833540	27835540	so I'm constantly dehydrated
27835540	27837540	suck
27837540	27839540	had school dance here in New Zealand
27839540	27841540	it was similar
27841540	27843540	cause I hate having to wipe my hands
27843540	27845540	hi
27845540	27847540	hi Astrone
27847540	27849540	what sort of maros would you hate to receive
27849540	27851540	I don't know
27859540	27861540	what would I hate to receive
27861540	27863540	I don't know
27865540	27867540	nothing really
27867540	27869540	ha ha
27869540	27871540	I don't know nothing really gets me like
27871540	27873540	I can't even think of an example
27873540	27875540	I don't know maybe like
27875540	27877540	ask me to finish a game
27877540	27879540	I didn't finish or something
27879540	27881540	or be like you suck at this game
27881540	27883540	oh my heart you've got me
27883540	27885540	I can't believe it I can't believe I didn't finish every single game I've ever started
27885540	27887540	oh you got me
27887540	27889540	I don't know I can't think of an example
27893540	27895540	I think the force this is
27895540	27897540	dances at some point in primary middle
27897540	27899540	I went to a school dance
27899540	27901540	there was not a specific dance I had to learn
27901540	27903540	ah
27903540	27905540	never went to a dance but always to the after party
27905540	27907540	ooh ballin
27907540	27909540	everyone quick tried to get under her skin
27909540	27911540	why would you want under my skin
27915540	27917540	you'd rather be
27917540	27919540	I would say in it but hold on a minute
27919540	27921540	that doesn't sound right
27921540	27923540	hold on a minute there
27925540	27927540	you suck at Skyrim
27927540	27929540	when you're gonna finish it
27929540	27931540	oh you've got me
27931540	27933540	tell me how bad I am at the RDA side
27933540	27935540	oh
27935540	27937540	you've got me I can't believe it
27937540	27939540	I should probably drink my tea and then we'll jump back into Skyrim
27939540	27941540	that's right the tunes are on
27941540	27943540	tunes are on
27943540	27945540	okay I'm hydrating
27945540	27947540	I'm hydrating
27953540	27955540	she doesn't even know how to chase the RDA
27955540	27957540	oh you've got me I didn't know
27957540	27959540	to put the grenade launcher on
27961540	27963540	who would have thought a grenade launcher
27967540	27969540	I can't believe it I'm being
27969540	27971540	I'm being dunked on
27975540	27977540	I would probably say the thing
27977540	27979540	that would genuinely upset me the most
27979540	27981540	is if someone sent me something nasty
27981540	27983540	about the daughters
27983540	27985540	and obviously if that starts to appear
27985540	27987540	in the inbox I know it's
27987540	27989540	not to pay heed
27989540	27991540	but it's probably the worst thing I can imagine
27991540	27993540	but then again I was like
27993540	27995540	well you're subjecting me to that and not them
27995540	27997540	so
27997540	27999540	it is what it is
28003540	28005540	I like how she goes idle
28005540	28007540	I self defend
28007540	28009540	well it's actually for hunting
28009540	28011540	but
28011540	28013540	I think it can be used
28013540	28015540	for a distraction as well before I ink on you
28015540	28017540	I just ink on you and run away
28017540	28019540	like what you're gonna do about it
28019540	28021540	before you can even react I'm already gone
28025540	28027540	if you ever play a follow game
28027540	28029540	do you go for stats or stylists
28029540	28031540	oh stats
28031540	28033540	I absolutely cannot
28033540	28035540	for the life of me

28055540	28057540	thank you for the tip
28059540	28061540	inks on you leaves refuses to elaborate
28061540	28063540	like an absolute chattel fish
28063540	28065540	that's right chattel fish I'll take that title
28065540	28067540	she blasted on me and ran away
28067540	28069540	what if I ink faster than you
28069540	28071540	one minute 56 I think
28071540	28073540	beat that good luck

28181540	28183540	retrieve the

28203540	28205540	can't go outside
28207540	28209540	which is funny because I have
28209540	28211540	a seed collection which I really enjoy
28211540	28213540	but of course seeds don't have pollen
28213540	28215540	issues on them although collecting them
28215540	28217540	sometimes can have traces of pollen
28217540	28219540	but it's not really a big deal like if you know what you're doing
28221540	28223540	a snot
28225540	28227540	okay okay okay our first dragon
28227540	28229540	come land okay it's just a basic

28239540	28241540	of course it resisted soul trap
28241540	28243540	it's a dragon
28243540	28245540	I'm the freaking
28245540	28247540	soul gem for the dragon I don't know where we're
28247540	28249540	pretending otherwise
28249540	28251540	oh

28253540	28255540	must have on his little there we go
28255540	28257540	I had just emptied like
28257540	28259540	all of my inventory only to pick all of that up again
28263540	28265540	that was quite a reaction
28265540	28267540	wait what did I do
28267540	28269540	did I make a funny noise seed collection
28269540	28271540	yeah you didn't see my stream yesterday
28271540	28273540	I showed off my seed collection
28273540	28275540	at like one hour in
28275540	28277540	mud crab down
28279540	28281540	obliterate that dragons one
28281540	28283540	ankle I know I smashed it
28283540	28285540	into dust and he is like okay I'm done
28285540	28287540	I'm done here
28289540	28291540	wow that was really easy
28291540	28293540	what a bad dragon
28301540	28303540	you don't have to tell me twice I'll keep cracking these
28303540	28305540	jokes all day long
28305540	28307540	I love hearing you narrative about your seeds
28307540	28309540	I can do like an actual informal
28309540	28311540	informational stream
28311540	28313540	I think there's four ways of seed dispersal
28313540	28315540	air
28315540	28317540	hook
28317540	28319540	berry
28319540	28321540	is there one more

30121540	30123540	wait you can't go that way
30123540	30125540	I love that actively when you talk
30125540	30127540	like when you do stuff in Skyrim
30127540	30129540	like the NPCs kind of discuss it
30129540	30131540	I think that's such a cool little
30131540	30133540	detail I have to admit for a game
30133540	30135540	for a game that came out in
30135540	30137540	2011 and was produced
30137540	30139540	like before that that was pretty
30139540	30141540	I don't give a that's pretty decent you know
30141540	30143540	like you're
30143540	30145540	gonna give it to them sometimes can't
30145540	30147540	can't give them all the credit but you gotta give it to them
30147540	30149540	sometimes uh unfortunately I believe
30149540	30151540	we do we have to go south
30151540	30153540	no we don't
30153540	30155540	I'm just taking super
30155540	30157540	long obnoxious way so I'm
30157540	30159540	going to teleport back and then I'm basically
30159540	30161540	just gonna go along the water's edge
30161540	30163540	to get to the stone store
30163540	30165540	death is highly overrated
30167540	30169540	infamous last words
30169540	30171540	IS the elusive warhammer
30171540	30173540	staff literally oh you didn't see it coming
30175540	30177540	just imagine how cool
30177540	30179540	Skyrim 2 will be
30181540	30183540	did they even announce it yet
30183540	30185540	or am I going crazy and they have
30185540	30187540	jeez how do I get down
30187540	30189540	I've not just done that have I
30189540	30191540	that'll be fine
30191540	30193540	that'll be fine on the old ankles
30193540	30195540	right maybe this will do
30195540	30197540	easy easy just
30197540	30199540	edge it a little bit
30199540	30201540	nice and slow slowly

30233540	30235540	do it all the time
30235540	30237540	I'm not being funny that girl gave me far too
30237540	30239540	much power with me seeing them freezes

30279540	30281540	I am
30281540	30283540	I am going to redirect into mercy
30283540	30285540	because unfortunately my achievements bugged out
30285540	30287540	so it kind of
30287540	30289540	may or may not have defeated
30289540	30291540	the whole purpose of this achievement
30291540	30293540	run
30293540	30295540	man we keep running into Talos
30295540	30297540	literally he was like that snake

30331540	30333540	Talos knows
30333540	30335540	see I'm a little I'm walking in a Talos
30335540	30337540	north west
30337540	30339540	so I can't even talk
30339540	30341540	I'm getting flustered
30341540	30343540	thinking there's a girl watching me what the fuck
30343540	30345540	okay right I'm just
30345540	30347540	going to confess this straight off the bat
30347540	30349540	so I used to play Call of Duty
30349540	30351540	and whenever there was like a girl on my team
30351540	30353540	I used to get really flustered and I couldn't even talk properly
30353540	30355540	I just like completely clam up
30355540	30357540	and I'm just like uh uh uh
30357540	30359540	and I just get really like freaking terrible about it
30359540	30361540	so it's really I don't know why
30361540	30363540	I still haven't come over yet
30363540	30365540	because I played a few rounds of valorant and it happened
30365540	30367540	there was a girl on my team and I couldn't speak
30367540	30369540	at all in voice chat and I don't know what it is
30369540	30371540	and it's not even like
30371540	30373540	I'm trying to like impress her or anything
30373540	30375540	I just like get all weird and like
30375540	30377540	I don't want to bother her you know I'm being weird
30377540	30379540	oh
30379540	30381540	I'm like
30381540	30383540	it's not like I'm trying to like pick someone up
30383540	30385540	or anything and I'm like freaking Call of Duty
30385540	30387540	I don't know why I get all clammed up and it's happening
30387540	30389540	it's literally happening right now in live stream
30389540	30391540	and I'm like oh my god now everyone knows I'm a weirdo
30391540	30393540	and I'm like uh
30393540	30395540	talking to Wham is hard
30395540	30397540	okay
30397540	30399540	better not speaking and starting
30399540	30401540	to say bad jokes

30415540	30417540	wait until she really is
30417540	30419540	so the reason
30419540	30421540	why it feels like it's different
30421540	30423540	for valorant girls is because
30423540	30425540	like I'm not trying to
30425540	30427540	I don't know
30429540	30431540	I'm not like trying to
30431540	30433540	you know get anything out of them
30433540	30435540	no that sounds really odd that makes it sound like I'm

31535540	31537540	life experiences
31537540	31539540	an XP bar
31539540	31541540	and when you talk to people
31541540	31543540	and when you get to hear other perspectives
31543540	31545540	you are very slowly filling up that bar
31545540	31547540	and a very big
31547540	31549540	life lesson
31549540	31551540	can be
31551540	31553540	hold on hold on
31553540	31555540	I'm wrecking and decking right now
31555540	31557540	hey
31563540	31565540	oh right okay well
31565540	31567540	you weren't really I thought
31567540	31569540	okay that was really bizarre
31569540	31571540	is this book
31573540	31575540	do you also get XP
31575540	31577540	but you also get XP for hurting people
31577540	31579540	what just wait until you find
31579540	31581540	the one butthole
31581540	31583540	who's
31583540	31585540	just enough XP to level up
31585540	31587540	oh no like seriously
31587540	31589540	I don't mind talking about like oh
31589540	31591540	I can teach you guys about debt and how it works
31591540	31593540	and how credit cards work
31593540	31595540	I genuinely believe credit cards
31595540	31597540	are the absolute spawn of
31597540	31599540	Satan for lack of better words
31599540	31601540	they're terrible
31601540	31603540	and once you get sucked into them
31603540	31605540	and you're uneducated in them
31605540	31607540	it's like obviously not part of your curriculum
31607540	31609540	surprise surprise
31609540	31611540	I wonder why
31611540	31613540	oh that's right we're going down the conspiracy theory hole again
31613540	31615540	like gee willikers I wonder why you're not told
31615540	31617540	about how to do your taxes
31617540	31619540	properly I wonder how you're not told to
31619540	31621540	financially gee it's almost like
31621540	31623540	the world runs if people
31623540	31625540	are on debt because of the way society is
31625540	31627540	set up because we love capitalism
31629540	31631540	which is why I absolutely
31631540	31633540	do not
31633540	31635540	want any
31635540	31637540	like tips or support

32669540	32671540	that's not fair
32679540	32681540	why
32681540	32683540	did gifting change
32683540	32685540	does gifting not go to the lowest tier
32685540	32687540	are we sure gifting doesn't do the lowest tier
32689540	32691540	what's gifting so when someone
32691540	32693540	is monetized you can gift
32693540	32695540	membership to other people
32695540	32697540	and
32699540	32701540	I specifically

32703540	32705540	you know what
32705540	32707540	we could test it on me

32715540	32717540	dance the line

32721540	32723540	strongy speaks
32723540	32725540	English
32725540	32727540	strongy speaks and my heart becomes weak
32727540	32729540	100% sure it doesn't
32729540	32731540	seen tons of channels with 199

32735540	32737540	let me cook
32737540	32739540	and I'll put the price that I want

32749540	32751540	any fallout
32753540	32755540	the fear
