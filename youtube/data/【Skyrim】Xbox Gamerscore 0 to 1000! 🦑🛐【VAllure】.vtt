00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
Testing, testing. Attention, please. Attention, attention. Hear you, hear you.

00:09.800 --> 00:17.040
Skyrim belongs to the North. That's my hear you, hear you. Why are you saying I

00:17.040 --> 00:22.840
hate you? I'm not even freaking spawning yet! Let me spawn in! You know, I learned

00:22.840 --> 00:28.000
something new yesterday thanks to TikTok so I can't wait to talk about it.

00:28.000 --> 00:39.320
Right, testing. This is Ambroker. See, this freaking, you freaking freaks. Oh my

00:39.320 --> 00:47.320
god! Oh my god! I'm YouTube, I got accepted from YouTube monetization like

00:47.320 --> 00:53.120
right now! No way! I just got accepted for YouTube monetization right freaking

00:53.120 --> 01:01.760
now! No way! Wait, but I need to do my stream then! Wait! Oh my god! I literally

01:01.760 --> 01:09.920
just opened up YouTube studio! I've been accepted! No way! Wait, do I need to go off

01:09.920 --> 01:19.200
lane and do my... No, I'll do it tomorrow. Oh my god! We did it! What the frick? What's

01:19.200 --> 01:25.080
the frick? Fractally tech? Tic-tac? Petty work? Oh my god! Wait, and hopefully this

01:25.080 --> 01:32.360
doesn't say anything. Wow! Wow! I just freaking checked! Right, right. We're still

01:32.360 --> 01:37.080
gonna do Skyrim today because you know, Skyrim belongs to the Norths. But what? Tomorrow I'll

01:37.080 --> 01:42.760
get to do my monetization celebration stream! And my toes look amazing for it so I'm

01:42.760 --> 01:49.320
excited! Oh my god! That's amazing! Right, if you're freaking watching right now,

01:49.320 --> 01:54.440
don't worry. Like the how you call it. The memberships aren't like activated

01:54.440 --> 01:58.240
because I need to like go in and tell it like what to call the tiers and stuff.

01:58.240 --> 02:06.240
But I'm like 100% sure tier one is $1.99 USD. This is to prevent anyone

02:06.240 --> 02:11.720
gaining access via gift to membership streams. And then I believe the the

02:11.760 --> 02:22.760
membership price, like the actual price, is $4.99 USD. Does that sound right? I need to ask you guys!

02:22.760 --> 02:31.080
I need to ask you guys what sounds right. You guys call the shots. Yeah, if it's $4.99

02:31.080 --> 02:36.840
and then Patreon's $5 then it's $9.99 total to support your Oshii at Veiler.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.720
You okay? That seems right. Okay, that sounds okay. Everyone's gonna give me the thumbs up.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.320
Ahhhh!

02:43.320 --> 02:48.680
Congrats on the monetization. Doesn't mean we won't support you in other ways anymore though.

02:48.680 --> 02:52.000
Oh, thank you so much. I really miss you.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
WAH!

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Congrats. I'm happy for you.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.600
Why are you giving me money for getting more money? What the fuck? It's an infinite money glitch.

03:03.240 --> 03:11.800
Oh my god. Also, there was an offline donation by Shank. Shank says, thank you for the tip,

03:11.800 --> 03:15.960
by the way, he says, I'm over here squiddin' my dick. I got ink on my dick right now.

03:16.520 --> 03:22.920
Which is so good. Thank you, Tim Schottel. Congrats on the monetization. Thank you!

03:22.920 --> 03:28.920
And Bajinga as well. Thank you again for the tip. For the 20. That was a big tip. Thank you.

03:29.240 --> 03:37.000
Okay. To prevent gifts, you need to set the membership quote above five bucks. Are you serious?

03:38.120 --> 03:42.120
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wasn't it not membership can only be gifted?

03:42.120 --> 03:42.760
Stop giving me!

03:43.720 --> 03:45.320
He's confusing the couple things.

03:45.320 --> 03:50.600
Then why are you giving me money for being able to make, oh my god, no! I have to end up

03:50.600 --> 03:55.960
my ASMR series now. I have four ASMR videos. I owe you.

03:56.680 --> 04:02.840
Oh, and I'm doing an endurance stream today. It's over. Reluctantly saying thank you for the tip.

04:03.960 --> 04:11.000
Wait, I could have sworn you can only gift the lowest tier membership on YouTube,

04:11.000 --> 04:16.120
or has that been updated since? I won't say who so they can announce it themselves,

04:16.120 --> 04:21.560
but someone else has also gotten monetized. Oh my god, we're all done or monetized?

04:21.560 --> 04:27.400
No way. Like, okay. So the only reason we didn't like get monetized faster in quotation marks

04:27.400 --> 04:30.680
is because you, stop it! Don't give me money! Forget money!

04:32.840 --> 04:38.680
Pre-ordering my search. Thank you. Don't stay down for the tip. That's crazy.

04:39.960 --> 04:45.480
That's freaking crazy. Gifts go to the most expensive tier under five bucks.

04:45.480 --> 04:50.280
So I need to set it as 501. That looks terrible though. That looks so greedy.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.640
But I can't have any outsiders in the membership streams because

04:55.640 --> 05:00.040
I need to use a lot of euphemisms. Are you squiddling right now?

05:00.040 --> 05:04.680
Shank! Oh, it's off-link! I'm in front of the Blackwater. I'm all about stron of the bath.

05:06.040 --> 05:11.960
Thanks, Shank, for the tip. You guys will get the Blackwater reference very shortly. Super training,

05:12.520 --> 05:20.840
Virginia! Stop! Actually, one cent greed law. Actually, it's two cent greed because I wanted it

05:20.840 --> 05:27.800
4.99. It's said it to... No, six dollars is too much. This is too much money to ask for,

05:27.800 --> 05:36.280
like, for membership stuff. Oh, right, that's it. When I said we're making an agency together,

05:36.920 --> 05:42.840
I wasn't kidding. Oh, I see. And our snowberries are here. They just did an ASMR stream. We all

05:42.840 --> 05:50.520
have to keep our voices down, okay? The snowberries are asleep. Fine, you've got it. Set it to 999.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.600
I would start at 60 bucks just to be sure. Post up, are you?

05:56.280 --> 06:03.400
And hi, Icy Raiders. Hi, snowberries. I just unlocked monetization. I didn't know

06:03.480 --> 06:09.320
until I freaking went on my channel. It just happened right now. I'm not going to do my monetization

06:09.320 --> 06:14.680
celebration today. I'm going to do it tomorrow and then it gives me a less time to do endurance

06:14.680 --> 06:19.720
skyrim unless we come back to maybe switch up the thingy. But that's okay. It's actually a perfect

06:19.720 --> 06:29.400
transition from Icy's stream. Hi, hi, little icicles. But yes, we are all getting monetized very

06:29.400 --> 06:36.920
slowly, which is fantastic. Oh my gosh, you can get support via email or chat. Don't worry,

06:36.920 --> 06:44.920
that chat support thing does absolutely nothing. I assure you, it doesn't do a single thing, okay?

06:46.440 --> 06:50.120
Actually, I tell a lie, they did help me one time, so I'll give it up.

06:50.120 --> 06:55.160
Amy, thank you, Amy, for your clap, clap, clap. Apparently, there's one other person that has

06:55.160 --> 07:00.040
been processed. When we applied, it was like, yeah, it takes a month for them to review your

07:00.040 --> 07:07.480
chat. A month, a month to review James Cameron's avatar, excuse me. A month to freaking review

07:07.480 --> 07:14.840
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, excuse me. Oh no, I never, oh, you guys so much ASMR video.

07:15.800 --> 07:22.760
But I do have some good news about VTuber Collabs. I finally, I finally

07:25.080 --> 07:32.360
sent away. So now I'm waiting on the girls. The ball is now in the girls court that I'm

07:32.360 --> 07:43.480
collabing with. Yeah, yesterday, I was listening to a music creator called Yoast. He's a Dutch

07:43.560 --> 07:49.880
and he was in Eurovision and he goes, Welcome to Europe. Life is till the

07:49.880 --> 07:57.960
daughter, Europa, Europa. Turns out he has a song where it goes, Sakma.

08:01.240 --> 08:09.560
So just imagine me playing the song and repeat in the dark, taping up four ASMR collabs in one go.

08:10.440 --> 08:17.320
A month review time sounds realistic, given the fact that your streams are all above 10 hours.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.800
Thank you for the tip again, but you're giving a lot of money. You need to be careful with the

08:23.800 --> 08:31.880
crowd. Are you just reading me right now? You're in trouble too. No, thank you for the tip. Oh my

08:31.880 --> 08:39.320
God. Damn, I almost got that song out of my head. Yeah, so basically just imagine me in a dark room,

08:39.320 --> 08:48.360
just I had this song on repeat. I'm like, yeah, okay, right. Wolf mums, Pamper you to sleep,

08:48.360 --> 08:53.240
right? Okay, what's next? Okay, jealous VTubers drag you in an alleyway for tangos. Okay,

08:53.240 --> 09:01.080
what's next? What's next? Right, next script. Like I was on it. I was on it. Anonymous. It's

09:01.080 --> 09:07.160
the silent and on his back. He's giving money, but he's not saying anything. He's not getting Brian

09:07.160 --> 09:12.840
to say anything. Thank you for the tip. But yeah, anyway, that's how I work. I don't know how you

09:12.840 --> 09:18.200
work, but I work like a madman. Had to take a shower. So I've got to listen at 1.5 speed for

09:18.200 --> 09:25.640
the next 15 minutes. I was not prepared for the super speed beat up. So I was as strongly forgotten

09:25.640 --> 09:32.920
to live tweet or tweet. If you mean tweet, I have absolutely horrific news. I am the worst VTuber

09:32.920 --> 09:39.880
to ever spawn. I never use my emotes. I spent like so much on all these emotes. I never use them. I

09:39.880 --> 09:43.880
never tweet out when I'm live because I start at the same time every single day and I'm like,

09:43.880 --> 09:52.280
you want to be here, you're gonna be here. Somebody. Absolutely. Next script. YouTube to

09:52.280 --> 09:57.320
monetize you one day after you get proved. I mean, depending on how the monetization celebration

09:57.320 --> 10:02.360
goes tomorrow, that's quite plausible. But hey, at least a little bit YouTube history.

10:03.320 --> 10:08.520
Don't mind if I make the headlines for VLR. So you guys go and support my gen mates. That's

10:08.520 --> 10:14.120
right. There are five other lovely girls in the description below for you to check out. If you

10:14.120 --> 10:22.120
cannot stand, Todd winning yet again with the death grip the Skyrim has over female VTubers.

10:22.120 --> 10:27.240
Okay. So if you've had enough of that, Denny, you worry, I've got you sorted out. Sheepsters

10:27.240 --> 10:32.920
is going live and team minus two hours. I believe Emma and Azura, my goodness, Azura,

10:32.920 --> 10:41.560
and is coming for my Endurance Stream title. For goodness gravy, she was up on a farm. No,

10:41.560 --> 10:47.800
it's not called Farmville. The farming star Jew Valley, for goodness sake. And then she

10:47.800 --> 10:51.880
really popped out of 10 of her Endurance Stream. I'm like, damn, they're coming from my title.

10:52.840 --> 10:56.200
But I'm gonna show them how it's done. Okay, I'm gonna show them how it's done. I woke up

10:56.200 --> 11:02.360
feeling sick and I was like, oh, maybe I won't do an Endurance Stream. But the moment I hit go live,

11:02.360 --> 11:08.280
it feels like I have been given a second burst of energy, a second wind, if you will. It's like

11:08.280 --> 11:15.480
that cinematic moment in like the video game thing. We're like, oh, Brian.

11:22.840 --> 11:31.960
Why would you give 100? That's so much. You never even said anything, Dapper Bucket. Oh my

11:31.960 --> 11:41.400
God. Thank you for the 100. Iron Reaper 100. Why are you? Why are you giving me money for being

11:41.400 --> 11:48.440
able to earn more money? What's going on? What's going on? Have I missed something in the VTuber

11:48.520 --> 11:54.680
etiquette book? Iron Reaper, thank you for the 100. Dapper, thank you for the 100. Zarian,

11:54.680 --> 12:02.120
congrats on monetization. Meeting great for anyone who goes over $20 on the donut. That's

12:02.120 --> 12:07.560
terrible. You can't say that part out loud. Literally, everyone is giving your... Yeah,

12:07.560 --> 12:16.520
please make sure you are fully sorted before you give any money. Please understand, I adore what I

12:16.520 --> 12:23.400
do. I have been welcomed with open arms into the VTuber community as someone who could definitely

12:23.400 --> 12:29.800
have been described as an outsider. And instead of being shunned, I was welcomed and taught the ropes,

12:29.800 --> 12:35.960
which I'm so thankful for. But please understand, like, I get streamed for free. I love what I do,

12:35.960 --> 12:44.840
okay? Anonymous with a 20 with no message again. Brian, you look, you need to put Brian to work,

12:45.400 --> 12:51.720
okay? You need to put Brian to work. Oh, anonymous, give me 20 because I said the 20 thing.

12:53.800 --> 13:03.160
That is terrible. But we've done it. We officially have finished our first week at Bueller Headquarters.

13:04.440 --> 13:10.280
Literally, everyone has done fantastic streaming. I am very happy to see some of the girls taking

13:10.280 --> 13:15.880
a break. Oh, Irvan Biscay. Brian. We don't like giving YouTube a cut.

13:18.040 --> 13:22.920
Wait, oh, that's why you do stream elements. Okay, I understand. I read about that. Thank you,

13:22.920 --> 13:29.160
Irvan Biscay. Brian! Don't know, we'll continue until morale improves. Congratulations. Wait,

13:29.160 --> 13:36.280
why did I know that? Do you guys hear Brian at all when he talks? Yeah, you do, surely you do.

13:36.520 --> 13:42.120
Oh, my God. Wait, you said I said your name yesterday correctly.

13:42.120 --> 13:48.680
Rilke? Rilke? Cadmus? Thank you for the tip. Why did I know that quote? Yeah, we hear him. Okay, thank

13:48.680 --> 13:56.840
God. God, it feels like so much longer. You've always been here. I think because, like, my average

13:56.840 --> 14:03.000
streamed week is probably what a VTuber achieves in an entire month. So it feels like I've been

14:03.000 --> 14:09.400
here for a very long time. I was like, nope, this is officially my first, like, strum, you know,

14:09.400 --> 14:14.920
first second week of streaming. Ancient joke, the beatings will continue until the more... Okay,

14:14.920 --> 14:26.760
that's... Okay, okay, okay. Guys, do you know a perfect way to party the achievement? A really

14:26.760 --> 14:32.200
big storm of bad joke. What did you even say? Was that supposed to be a joke? I don't get it.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.600
I don't get the joke if that was supposed to be a joke. So you're getting crickets.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.640
Who's ready? Who's ready for bi-zura, bi-zura, bi-zura. Now, I know that's not in this game,

14:45.640 --> 14:49.240
but bi-zura. Remember that time I accident... Wait, can you hear the game?

14:52.520 --> 14:55.640
Can you hear any of that? You can't hear any of that.

14:56.600 --> 15:02.200
Oh, oh, oh, wait, get monetization off the screen right now.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.600
Oh, my freaking mouse won't hover over... Right, there we go.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.320
Oh, my voice is cracking already. I've known you started...

15:18.280 --> 15:26.520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Don't again, don't again. Don't again, No Skyrim.

15:27.320 --> 15:32.760
I don't know the words. One of them was like all glass, for like a meme fucking cover.

15:36.360 --> 15:40.600
By Pope Ryan. This is our attempt at normalizing corporate,

15:40.600 --> 15:48.960
Great free donations. Wait. No, are you guys neutral it? Wait you oh god. Thank you so much for all the tips. Holy sugar

15:51.160 --> 15:52.360
Thank you

15:52.360 --> 15:54.160
Etherna a oh my god

15:54.160 --> 16:00.920
My mouse won't hover over OBS so I can lower the volume of the frickin game. Oh, it's so loud. Oh, that's getting loud

16:00.920 --> 16:05.360
All right, I've turned it down a wee bit and turn me up

16:11.360 --> 16:14.340
There's a Brian echo now

16:15.760 --> 16:20.440
Right, I guess I'll just play him through desktop only. I'll just need to test if this works

16:21.400 --> 16:26.120
Okay, okay, it works. It works. Okay. Let's jump into it. Do you know the actual lyrics?

16:26.120 --> 16:29.640
I say dovahkin dovahkin dovahkin of Skyrim

16:33.280 --> 16:37.640
Level one oh, it's been so freakin long since I've played this game. Oh

16:38.400 --> 16:40.400
My god

16:47.880 --> 16:54.240
No mods of course right no vanilla, I'm appreciating the game and its release quality

16:54.640 --> 17:00.760
I do understand those who prefer a modded experience. I like to appreciate a game the way it has been released

17:00.760 --> 17:02.760
I understand there's always time constraints

17:02.760 --> 17:07.440
There's always stuff that has been taken out for example ruining the thieves guild

17:08.760 --> 17:10.760
and

17:11.400 --> 17:15.880
But I just I want to appreciate it how it is

17:16.640 --> 17:18.880
Wait, I didn't hear any of that if that played

17:19.840 --> 17:26.520
Tharya from soul time to high rocks Skyrim is for the Nord's first road. Ah, oh

17:27.800 --> 17:30.640
I'm on controller by the way because I'm used to playing Xbox

17:33.520 --> 17:36.600
No mods as good as God intended

17:39.720 --> 17:41.720
Is Brian talking at all I

17:43.520 --> 17:45.520
Don't hear Brian at all now

17:47.160 --> 17:50.080
Can you guys hear Brian I can't hear him he said the

17:53.560 --> 17:55.560
Only put subtitles on as well

17:56.440 --> 17:59.760
Freaking positive. Yeah. Hold on. Oh my god. Oh my god. I can't see my mouse

17:59.880 --> 18:02.840
It's not giving me my freaking cursor, please please

18:04.040 --> 18:08.200
Stop this madness, please, right? You're just gonna have to deal with double Brian. Oh

18:09.640 --> 18:14.280
My god, that's like proper pause. Holy shit reluctantly seen. Thank you for the 20

The leader of the storm cloaks, Yarl

18:34.200 --> 18:37.240
Thank you reluctantly same for the tip gaming kits, honey

18:38.120 --> 18:41.080
Congrats, Johnny. Also. I found this donor. I think you dropped it

18:42.080 --> 18:45.880
Giving me money giving me money because I made money

18:48.560 --> 18:50.560
Should be of home

18:52.200 --> 18:54.200

20:04.560 --> 20:07.040
Identifying yourself as a fallout wanderer

20:07.720 --> 20:14.440
Apparently we can do fallout 76 multiplayer. I don't know how it's gonna work too much monetization get absolutely loved on nerd

20:14.440 --> 20:16.440
How dare you?

20:16.560 --> 20:23.200
Merida is the god who owns the beacon. Ah, right. We're ERPing now as a Skyrim

20:24.760 --> 20:26.760
Day deities

20:28.960 --> 20:33.720
Johnny, please make the stop that's funny as anything

20:35.920 --> 20:39.600
Okay, are we right we're gonna be role-playing out the wazoo

20:40.680 --> 20:42.680
Nord what is the bill today?

20:42.680 --> 20:45.040
a

20:45.040 --> 20:50.520
Grembo, thank you for the congrats and the tip. We are Nord filled. Okay, we are Nord

20:50.520 --> 20:54.800
We are Stormcloak. We are enjoying the game as the

20:55.440 --> 21:02.920
Resistance or the opposition to what the Legion is trying to put on the upon Skyrim as a whole

21:03.120 --> 21:06.640
Okay, so Skyrim is the current region that we're in

21:07.240 --> 21:10.160
There's different regions such as Hammerfell for example

21:10.160 --> 21:10.920
Oh

21:10.960 --> 21:15.200
Brian you rather go to the woods with a high elf or a grizzly bear

21:16.520 --> 21:18.120
I

21:18.120 --> 21:21.000
Don't know could I take on a high elf? I feel like I'm really weak

21:22.800 --> 21:29.840
Apparently polar bears are actually the most aggressive breed of bear if you didn't know that grizzly bears actually avoid human intervention apparently right?

21:29.840 --> 21:31.840
So we are Nordic

21:32.600 --> 21:37.120
Seasons of Skyrim they are tall and fair haired people strong and hardy

21:37.120 --> 21:41.960
Nord's are famous for their resistance to cold and their talent as warriors

21:41.960 --> 21:45.440
They can use a battle cry to make opponents flee

21:46.120 --> 21:49.920
Fantastic. Um, are we gonna be a man or a woman? Oh?

21:50.720 --> 21:52.720
um

21:53.400 --> 21:55.400
Oh

21:55.440 --> 21:59.560
Okay, okay, just a few technicals. It's a technical difficulty

22:00.040 --> 22:03.040
Do you get to the cloud district very often? Oh?

22:03.480 --> 22:10.520
What am I saying? Of course you don't thank you Nazim. Are you roleplayed as NPCs of Skyrim?

22:11.400 --> 22:16.200
Nazim, I'm not really I don't know if you can hear that but that's me click and select on Nord

22:17.080 --> 22:22.440
Oh, it's it's trigger. Is this where the membership pre-orders happen stop?

22:24.640 --> 22:31.480

22:52.520 --> 22:54.520

22:54.520 --> 23:00.520
No breaks on this alluring train. Oh my god. You guys are in it. You're in it to win it

23:00.640 --> 23:05.840
No, did I get to play a whammin? I get to be a whammin or do you guys not like when whammin?

23:05.840 --> 23:10.440
I don't know. I feel like if we're seared at someone's booty all day, I'd rather pick a whammin, you know

23:10.920 --> 23:16.400
But thank you so much for all these tips Phoenix bearer Nazim. Yeah. Yeah, Nazim

23:17.240 --> 23:24.480

23:24.640 --> 23:28.040
What's the matter? Someone steal your sweet role?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.040
Oh my

23:31.200 --> 23:38.080
Someone stole your sweet role. I used to be able to do the accent in Skyrim, but then I'm completely bloody forgotten how to do it

23:38.080 --> 23:40.080
I'll need to listen to it a bit more. Um

23:40.480 --> 23:42.980
Right, we're gonna be young and pretty and

23:44.120 --> 23:47.000
So we'll use that face

23:48.160 --> 23:55.400
We're gonna be white as possible because you'll never guess what color I am and the reason why you don't do skinny is because

23:55.640 --> 23:58.360
As skinny as possible is because the clothes

23:59.120 --> 24:04.120
Texture on the shoulders. Can you see that you actually are better if you want less clothes?

24:05.000 --> 24:10.520
Mashing to put the weight up just a wee tiny wee bit and for the complexion again

24:10.520 --> 24:13.440
We're wanting young and the door do we want freckles?

24:14.760 --> 24:20.400
I don't know freckles mainstream. Fuck it. We'll get no dirt. Do you want a kill scar?

24:21.360 --> 24:28.560
And the name of the nodes I pray to the Lord's you all get a taste of my blade and my sword and I'm taking on hordes of enemies

24:30.240 --> 24:32.600
I'm going on hordes of weaponry's

24:33.600 --> 24:39.400
I think I think cheeky little scars on the face there just to kind of show that we mean business, okay?

24:39.680 --> 24:42.760
Where is here? I don't really I'm not really fussed for all this stuff

24:43.200 --> 24:46.360
Nick color. I didn't even know that was a cent

26:18.480 --> 26:24.840

28:39.280 --> 28:45.840

28:45.840 --> 28:48.760
Smart booth all lights were turned off. So we'll need to just

28:50.520 --> 28:54.920

34:39.920 --> 34:41.920
Yeah, we don't like people who aren't

34:42.920 --> 34:47.240
No, if you actually know the lore of Skyrim, it's actually pretty outrageous

34:47.240 --> 34:50.840
I don't know why the storm cooks are the baddies. I'm not I'm not going mental

35:24.600 --> 35:26.600
Where do I

35:27.800 --> 35:34.920
Hello, oh, it's controls not sounds my apologies, right run toggle POV

35:34.920 --> 35:38.600
No, absolutely not sprint sprint should be this one

35:39.240 --> 35:41.240
crouch should be

35:42.200 --> 35:46.520
What one should crutch be I can only know I only know which one crutch should be okay

35:46.520 --> 35:50.880
Crutch should be the other analog stick. I need to go back out in order to do it properly

35:53.360 --> 36:00.440
Let's go it's happening wait, what's that what I four six was six days ago. Wait, what what did it for monetize talents?

36:00.440 --> 36:04.720
Oh, did I miss it? I mean four of us monetize. Oh my god, you need to oh

36:05.200 --> 36:08.360
All the girls. I don't know if there's any girls lurking right now

36:08.480 --> 36:10.480
You need to think of your monetization stream

36:11.600 --> 36:16.440
She be already put what hers is I think I said what mine was in chat if you don't know what to do

36:16.440 --> 36:20.440
Don't worry. I'll help you after my stream. What was I doing snake sneak is

36:21.480 --> 36:23.480
Crouches other this button

36:24.320 --> 36:26.320

I can't remember my sentence from childhood god damn it's been so long toggle POV left bumper

36:42.480 --> 36:47.240
No, let a character menu is probably left bumper then first row da is

36:48.640 --> 36:55.560
Right bumper. Yes. Okay. This looks correct. Why oh no jump right one last one

36:55.560 --> 36:59.840
I'm so sorry. Please. Please. I'm so sorry a jump is alpha

37:00.840 --> 37:06.720
Activate is why yeah, this looks correct. Sorry. I'm an Xbox kid. I'm not gonna be that a la gunkies

37:06.880 --> 37:12.920
Wait is be crouching state. Oh, I think be is crouch. You know that hold on hold on pause pause the tunes

37:12.920 --> 37:20.480
I need time to shoelaces a crouch crouch crouch crouch sneak and then Poggle TV. Yeah, yeah, that's fine

37:21.200 --> 37:23.560
Please monetize the last two so everyone is happy together

37:25.280 --> 37:27.280
Go ahead take it

37:27.760 --> 37:30.520
Mmm, right one more to get right everything

37:34.520 --> 37:40.680
Oh, oh, let's get that off. Let's check out the drip. Oh, look at the storm cold drip

37:42.480 --> 37:45.040
To your one should be a motess in the rest can have been practice

37:45.080 --> 37:50.160
Can you check your difficulty? I think it's all bug. No, no, nothing wrong with the difficulty of the game

37:50.920 --> 37:55.160
Wait, what do we need to oh wait? There's about to be an enemy that comes through a thing or something

37:55.320 --> 38:02.240
We're about to jump on hope by tomorrow six at six. I would love that for all the girls. They're so excited

38:08.880 --> 38:11.520
They can't see us they don't know

38:12.680 --> 38:17.240
He can't see me at all is he like directly at me by the way. Oh

38:20.560 --> 38:24.200
My god, I forgot how clunky the fricking if you're late

38:25.160 --> 38:27.280
Oh my god, this is so clunky

38:28.880 --> 38:30.880
Yes, yes a key a key

38:32.480 --> 38:34.000
Take all

38:34.000 --> 38:40.400
Definitely gonna quit these because they're a lot better than right. I know I'm dressing up as the enemy. Okay, but

38:40.680 --> 38:46.600
That's heavy armor. We're gonna wait. Where the frick is the key or he gets the key. Okay?

38:47.640 --> 38:51.040
Storm coke and drip in the same sentences oxymoronic

38:51.920 --> 38:53.520
How do you they're both bad

38:53.520 --> 38:59.200
But storm cooks are just worse the High King was leader of the good factions of Skyrim and he surrendered to the Empire because they were the

38:59.200 --> 39:05.480
Less bad option. I didn't know that I thought it was like the Thalmor Embassy came in and they were like you can he worship

39:05.480 --> 39:10.240
Talus anymore and I was like you can't he come into my company and tell me what I can do and can he do so

39:10.240 --> 39:12.240
I'll pick this guy the storm cooks

39:13.200 --> 39:17.520
Like you can't he just go and be doing that like that's a region's right. Where's the enemies? Oh

39:18.360 --> 39:19.800
Oh

39:19.800 --> 39:26.280
Yeah, that's right. Look at that come. Oh my god. It's so bad on PC like when we analog stick

39:30.200 --> 39:34.720
Stealth goes from input. I don't know. I'm normally like a two-handed player

39:34.720 --> 39:40.640
I'll always try to be an archer and I'll always end up two-handed because there's a really good freakin and

39:42.480 --> 39:44.480
There's a really good

39:48.520 --> 39:51.000
Enchantment which you can get from

39:54.720 --> 40:00.600
Yes, sorry torturer. Yeah. Yeah, you're trying to tell me that a oh

40:01.720 --> 40:04.800
She get in it. She annihilated him

40:07.960 --> 40:09.960
No, I haven't seen him

40:10.360 --> 40:15.040
You can lock pick these for like I guess we'll try it. So there's

40:15.760 --> 40:21.760
You can literally smurf this if you leave and then shuggle it you hear that

40:24.320 --> 40:31.520
Hear that if you do super gently see so we know know it's left side. Oh

40:33.920 --> 40:35.920
I'm not getting pranked

40:36.200 --> 40:37.480
There

40:37.480 --> 40:41.800
You can literally smurf like all this stuff if you want it to be made you can pick up the stuff

40:41.800 --> 40:45.640
But we are actually gonna sell it because it's good money

40:45.640 --> 40:50.280
I don't think I think there's a shield behind here if you wanted to do. Yeah, if you want a shield then

40:50.920 --> 40:54.480
There is one here, but I don't really bother a shield that I do two-handed

40:54.480 --> 40:57.040
So we're gonna get a war hammer very shortly

40:57.320 --> 41:01.080
There should be coins down here and one of these if I'm not mistaken

41:01.080 --> 41:09.000
I guess 300 no 300 coins seems a bit extreme. Maybe 30 coins in there. We are just gonna blast through it

41:10.000 --> 41:11.200
Um

41:11.200 --> 41:17.560
Try two-handing mage mage is my fave. No two-handed warrior two-handed

41:18.000 --> 41:21.360
Lightweight warrior and you can muck around with a bow and arrow

41:21.520 --> 41:25.960
Like if you do the nightingale quest you get light armor. That's pretty sneaky

41:26.480 --> 41:32.840
But the thief skilled armor especially for the stamina and like item increase is so good

41:33.720 --> 41:37.880
and as for how we're gonna tackle what we do first

41:38.640 --> 41:44.560
I'm going to purposefully do the companions quest line and then load a previous save

41:45.000 --> 41:50.040
Because I don't like oh, sorry. Sorry. Hold on. I was out of stamina. I was trying to reach up and

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
that oh

41:55.280 --> 41:58.840
I see just posted a very watery tweet. No way

42:00.160 --> 42:02.560
the the piss corp

42:03.840 --> 42:06.700
Accusations we ain't beating them today and we ain't beating them tomorrow

42:07.700 --> 42:10.940
The nightingales. Yeah pure mage is hard mode. I

42:11.940 --> 42:17.160
There should be something up here if I remember correctly on the right side of these rocks

42:17.620 --> 42:19.780
What was it? Oh, it's just a weak coin purse

42:20.540 --> 42:28.140
I got 14 gold. Honestly purse scaly boy. He's he's gone. He he couldn't get out, but the bars are broken now. I

42:28.920 --> 42:34.440
Love the jewel wheels nightingale peeler. No, no peeler

42:35.220 --> 42:38.880
That's awful, but that's hilarious at the same time

42:41.340 --> 42:45.600
Right, there are spiders so if any of you are arachnophobic whoa

42:47.560 --> 42:49.160
Don't worry

42:49.160 --> 42:54.280
They are getting absolutely. Yeah, I've been poisoned. I think they give stamina for space

42:54.280 --> 42:59.840
But yeah, please look away if you're arachnophobic. We are just gonna blast through this area

43:00.540 --> 43:02.540
Did I come from here?

43:04.580 --> 43:09.540
I think there's something to look up there. Maybe I don't know I can't

43:10.580 --> 43:17.480
There is a bear ahead. I say look away, but you're too busy doing something on your alternative Twitter, so it's okay

43:20.300 --> 43:22.300
She doesn't have to know

43:22.540 --> 43:25.180
We are gonna take this for some really quick money

43:25.180 --> 43:31.980
I believe there is an achievement for holding 100,000 gold at one stage the best way to make gold

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
I have found is

43:34.160 --> 43:35.720
by

43:35.720 --> 43:38.000
enchanting and selling that jewelry and

43:39.080 --> 43:43.980
There is a bit of a mild strut that I devised myself. I don't know if it's the strut

43:45.400 --> 43:49.600
Survival mode survival adds the need absolutely not. What is this?

43:50.320 --> 43:55.900
Survival adds the need to eat sleep and stay warm also adds challenges such as no no and no

43:56.280 --> 44:00.440
I want vanilla Skyrim. Oh my god. Is that is that PC?

44:02.760 --> 44:04.760
I

44:07.360 --> 44:12.400
Just really am I not am I not getting achievements on Xbox for this? I don't think I am

44:13.400 --> 44:15.400
I'm not

44:15.400 --> 44:20.440
I named the stream zero to 1,000. Well, that's a very accurate over them

44:21.640 --> 44:23.640
Are you playing anniversary?

44:24.120 --> 44:29.880
In additional challenge. Oh, well, we should have gone achievement there, but we're not playing Xbox. I'm dumb

44:30.380 --> 44:37.180
Imagine having to eat each 10 cheese wheels. Um, so there is a really easy mine

44:37.180 --> 44:41.780
You can clear out. I think it will give us two handed. Um, that's just there to head

44:42.300 --> 44:49.980
It's like right in your oh, actually. Sorry the standard stones first standing stones. I believe there are 12 standing stones which give you a

44:51.180 --> 44:57.140
Certain boosts such as a faster leveling XP under certain things. So there's a mage stone

44:57.140 --> 45:02.560
There's a thief stone and there is a warrior stone, but there's different ones as well one

45:02.560 --> 45:08.160
I believe is like a mule stone where you just straight up can carry more items on your persons

45:08.560 --> 45:13.600
Yeah, literally activate thief activate mage activate warrior. We are gonna do thief

45:16.280 --> 45:19.120
Are we gonna do thief what's warrior I've forgotten

45:20.760 --> 45:26.080
Right, we'll do warrior normally I do thief but we will we're gonna clear out this mine very quickly

45:26.140 --> 45:33.820
We're just gonna pick up ingredients as we go along the way of the stones the way work. Yeah, there should be achievement to find them all. Yes

45:36.340 --> 45:37.580
Well

45:37.580 --> 45:44.860
So that just not have achievements at all because I'm not I'm playing on Xbox game pass, but it's not like instance to

45:46.140 --> 45:48.140
Xbox

45:49.020 --> 45:51.400
Don't be too afraid of the wolves on the

45:52.400 --> 45:57.740
They are to hit they can give you rock joint. Oh, I've gone past the mine already

45:58.420 --> 46:00.180
They can give you

46:00.180 --> 46:03.480
Is it no, it's a rock joint or is it lockjaw? I

46:04.740 --> 46:07.240
Think it's rock joint. Oh

46:09.060 --> 46:16.220
My memory of me I've gone so past this mine shaft. Yeah, here we go. Right. There should be a bad day out here. Hello

46:17.500 --> 46:19.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

46:20.320 --> 46:28.560
You're playing a novice. No, no, these accusations are unfound. It is rock. I thought that but strong eight

46:28.560 --> 46:29.720
Where is the

46:29.720 --> 46:34.000
Blarney and yes, I know the Blarney stone. What?

46:35.200 --> 46:37.200
Are you trying to make a ballamore joke?

46:37.520 --> 46:40.360
There's a trip wire here in this mine, but don't worry about it

46:40.360 --> 46:49.200
As I said, you can please get him up whatever level you want. I like blasting through and just absolutely annihilate and take this

46:49.920 --> 46:55.360
Like it's so good. There are some later stages were even been on easy mode. Isn't that bad?

46:55.680 --> 47:01.080
Although I have to admit. I guess this is registering as PC Skyrim and

47:02.080 --> 47:07.740
It's quite different. Oh, this is so sad. They made this person mine themselves to death

47:08.520 --> 47:14.280
They've had me working down here for days now. It's not the time that's getting to me though. It's these tunnels

47:14.280 --> 47:18.440
I've told this countless times now to add extra support to the weak sections of the tunnel

47:18.460 --> 47:23.220
If only we had more of these wooden beams that were we reinforced with bronze bottoms

47:23.660 --> 47:28.220
Honestly, if I hear the earth shift one more time above my head, I'm so stressed. I may stop drinking for good

47:28.220 --> 47:33.340
I mean, what's a Nord without his mead and he died because of a collapse in

47:34.060 --> 47:36.420
So my granddad was a miner

47:37.380 --> 47:42.380
and he used to tell me really rough stories about

47:42.800 --> 47:44.800
Um

47:45.120 --> 47:51.640
The he is like being in the mineshaft and all of that and they had a mine collapse and

47:52.360 --> 47:56.920
Within two minutes. They had already killed the guy out and he was gone like he

47:57.720 --> 48:01.600
Parish it was great. I may a minor. Yes

48:02.200 --> 48:03.440
and

48:03.440 --> 48:10.080
They do I think bandits normally have like a lockpick and coin, but it's not really the best

48:10.900 --> 48:12.900
and

48:13.180 --> 48:16.980
You can't just like straight up grab this shit, but there is a big chest in here

48:16.980 --> 48:23.780
So we're just gonna clear out the way unless we oh, I was gonna say unless we speak but the guy's right there

48:24.620 --> 48:29.420
And yeah, but like my granddad used to talk so openly about the

48:30.820 --> 48:32.820
We just got it just like

48:33.300 --> 48:37.020
Callers. Oh, no, hold on. Everyone knows I'm bad at log-picking now

48:37.560 --> 48:43.480
Um, okay, we've got our first. What are you 20 damage rate 20 damage?

48:48.320 --> 48:50.920
He like spoke so openly about it and I'm like

48:51.760 --> 48:53.320
Granddad

48:53.320 --> 49:00.240
Granddad, that's just straight up like stuff. That's like man-made like horrors beyond comprend comprehension type stuff

49:00.920 --> 49:02.920
this chest

49:03.700 --> 49:08.900
Okay, we're definitely on PC cuz amber does

49:09.620 --> 49:11.780
Not look like that. What the heck?

49:12.540 --> 49:17.580
What the heck? I've never seen that in Skyrim before am I going crazy or

49:18.580 --> 49:20.580
I don't know

49:20.780 --> 49:22.780
Right don't get ready to swing

49:24.900 --> 49:26.900
Oh

49:27.880 --> 49:29.320
Oh

49:29.320 --> 49:33.760
And if the book is valued at 50 coins or more

49:34.000 --> 49:41.580
You will level up reading that book if you are ever in a section and you're like what the heck are all these books if that book is

49:41.580 --> 49:43.580
valued at 50

49:43.760 --> 49:47.260
Septim or more then it is actually a skill book. Oh

49:48.200 --> 49:50.200
Oh my god, that's so satisfying

49:51.280 --> 49:53.920
That's so freaking satisfying

49:56.900 --> 50:00.240
Hold on a minute. Yeah, that's a yeah, bone archer

50:01.760 --> 50:08.800
Um, I think there's a tiny little chest on the edge here. I think there's a little bug with a difficulty

50:08.800 --> 50:13.000
No, not at all. I'm playing on. Oh wait. It's just an a vein

50:13.640 --> 50:19.720
If you didn't know and these are called veins when you can see the ore sticking out from the wall

50:19.720 --> 50:26.720
It's quite interesting. Honestly, maybe I should talk about mining because my granddad spoke to me in big detail about it

50:27.380 --> 50:28.980
and

50:28.980 --> 50:36.500
Like how they used to come out and like their eyes really bloodshot red and everything and have I missed that chest back there?

50:36.500 --> 50:38.980
I think I have but it's not a big deal

50:42.020 --> 50:46.780
Yeah, I thought that and I just like I was like I've missed that chest having a bit fine

50:46.980 --> 50:51.820
If you run where your weapon out your stamina will decrease, but that's okay. You don't really need it

50:52.820 --> 50:58.180
Especially when you're just so good at the game like playing legendary mode like as I'm playing right now

50:58.180 --> 51:03.580
If you didn't know I'm playing legendary mode like just because I'm such a pro everything becomes really easy

51:03.580 --> 51:08.660
And you just have to like understand the strats as long as you like swing first

51:09.060 --> 51:15.660
Basically, you win every fight and the reason why they hardly do any damage to me is

51:16.320 --> 51:20.780
Because I have such high defense, of course and not any other reason

51:21.380 --> 51:26.940
If you're looking for work, go see pot at the main rail off said you could help me

51:27.660 --> 51:29.660
Reload you know him

51:30.460 --> 51:35.180
He's a friend. He promised you could help we escaped from the amperials together did

51:36.140 --> 51:41.340
We heard that all free cause she lied as easily should breathe. What are you talking about? This is legendary

51:45.100 --> 51:50.140
Literally like I know it's hard to believe that a beach over is just so good at skyrim

51:50.220 --> 51:53.260
That they can play legendary mode as casually as I can

51:54.140 --> 51:56.140
But it's just it's just the way it is. Okay

51:59.260 --> 52:04.860
So the area is now just discovering that dragons are coming back

52:11.500 --> 52:13.500
Legendary easy one never heard of it

52:14.140 --> 52:16.780
Legendary is easy mode because I'm just so skilled at this game

Well can't fake proof like that. You're clearly a true gamer. Thank you. I appreciate it. I don't know why sometimes

53:56.860 --> 54:00.140
Look, it's a hard pill to swallow to admit that sometimes

54:00.460 --> 54:04.540
You know a girl may be better than you at a game, but that's okay. That's okay

54:04.860 --> 54:10.540

54:18.780 --> 54:21.580
We are gonna try and hit some of these markers

The dark brotherhood line I can hear a child in the game. Please stop

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:14.540
Please cease your your dialogue. The yarrow said you had a project you needed help with

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.820
Project you think you could help me wait. You need to spare his life. He always attacks

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.980

The yarrow can be found. Wait. Oh my god. Oh, where's oh for goodness sake. I had to wait for this foreign dialogue

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:35.100
You need to end all the assassins quest and spare him. I could just warn he attacks me every time

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:42.860
I spare him. Are you squinting me right now? I'm such a fake gamer. Oh, yes, my favorite skyrim gargled ball mass

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.220
Thank you for the tip tharya

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.380
He's not

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:52.220
Look, he's not the worst yarrow, but he's a bit funny in the head. Okay

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.260
He could have he could have acted a bit more

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.140

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:02.380

Leave the details to your better streets

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:14.940
We are going to bleak falls bar right so this is how you make a sugar ton of money the arcane and channel

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:22.140
Uh, we're just and you literally get to level up just by destroying by destroying stuff. It's pretty cool

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:28.700
Anyway, we'll let them keep yapping away because we're about to unlock our dragon born powers

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:34.460
Is that john skyrim from the hit legendary show skyrim?

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.580
Yeah, but at the end of the fight you can decide to kill him or go away

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:46.860
I could have sworn he attacks me on xbox. I'm wondering if it's possible

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:51.340
Um, there might be a few coded differences

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:56.860
Battleborn give me your money. I don't have any money

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.780
Why didn't they hire me to be the mpc's like seriously? Could you imagine me like hanging a boot?

Bleak falls bar. Oh, I need to go. Uh, we're just gonna go on riverwood real quick

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.740
But not a big yapper as

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:27.180
Um, I'm actually I'm having a mental debate right now

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.340
Um

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:38.300
So because we're not currently getting achievements like on steam or

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.260
here

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:49.100
I'm wondering if I should do a short two hour stream then come back and do the monetization stream possibly

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.660
I'm having to master debate about that. Um

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.460
Oh my god, there's a firefly

01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:01.180
You cannot believe your eyes like 10 million fireflies

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.540
Let out the world as I fail asleep

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.300
Planet air

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.460
turns

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:16.540
It's hard to stay awake when I'd rather be asleep

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.220
Everything is never as it seems

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:26.380
He's half fall asleep. Uh, there are wolves currently biting my ankles, but it's fine

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.940
Oh, oh, no, it's not. I'm gonna get lock joints perish

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.700
Be gone

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.260
You can meet sister outside white run before doing the burp

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.620
Dark brother. Yes, you can meet him in his travels. It's possible

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:47.500
But you just have to beat him up first and the it's from UG. Can't wait for karaoke sneak peek at the next concert

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.740
Oh, the next be a lure cover

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.820
The fact, you know the lyrics to that song of my heart is alarming

01:04:54.380 --> 01:05:01.020
It was like a really big song. I was like, can I believe your eyes like 10 million fireflies?

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.380
Let out the world as I fail asleep

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.820
These are bandits. I can't remember what the loot is up here

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:12.620

We got to hit uh, I think there's a bad guy up here. So we're actually gonna sneak for one

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.980
Oh, something can see us. Oh, we're hitting again

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:26.620
I think there is a bad guy in the chair up here. We just need a little oh, yeah

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.780
Oh, yeah, I heard that knife. Don't think I didn't hear it. We're

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:36.300
Oh

The kill counts in this game are so ridiculous literally bludgeoned him to death

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:47.420
Um, I'll still leave the the light armor on. I know why are you doing two-handed with light armor?

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.500
Look, I just like light armor. Okay

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:53.660
Heavy armor. You'll never guess what heavy armor takes up a lot of room and it's heavy

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.140

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.460
Oh, I remember her

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:27.260
Going up these stairs for the first time and I was absolutely terrified of everything in this game

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.500
Oh

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:35.740
And I was I was probably oh, it's probably just the baby playing on the medium difficulty the default

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:41.500
Uh, oh, don't worry. We didn't actually get hit. Oh, we didn't get hit. That was called a whiff

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:46.380
That's that's what's known as a whiff in video games. Don't worry. Don't worry. We're still fine

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:53.500
No, the guy oh someone's shooting at me. I heard that bone. I don't know. Can I confess something if I

Ever play skyrim nowadays. I cheat with 300 speed

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:01.820
In speed malt command. What's that? I don't even know what that is. Uh

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.660
There should be a little dialogue. Did I have a bow and arrow?

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.180
I don't actually think I have a arrow

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.300
I had the chance to pick up a bow and I didn't

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.500
That's what I get for

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.820
No, don't worry

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.540
Oh, we're doing the golden claw. Oh my god

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:25.420
Right, I'm actually gonna pick up our bow for moments like that where we could legit just grab that stuff

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.420
There should be a little chest here. Oh, okay

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.060
Yeah, I'm a wee glaze. Go kiss

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:38.860
Oh such a good lock pick up 47 gold look we're not exactly breaking the bank here

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.580
Right. I think what I'll do

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:43.980
tomorrow

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.900
I'm just thinking

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:53.020
Why am I why I'm I'm so dumb and set this up but not to be on xbox game pass

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:59.420
Um, because I'm not getting any achievements. I think we'll do it. I'll play for two hours and we'll redirect into sheepsters

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:05.340
When she comes up and then I will replay everything that I achieved basically

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.860
Oh, this is supposed to be a tutorial if you don't

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:13.660
I've just upset him. He pulls it to show you that it's wrong

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:17.580
And I think he perishes here

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.580
But he's yeah

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.780
Yeah, it's like no health. So it's uh snake snake dolphin

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:33.740
You could just run the do the campaign and do monetization. Yeah

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:36.620
or yeah, actually maybe

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.780
um

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:44.140
Maybe we just do the main campaigns. I wouldn't actually I would be quite happy

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:51.580
and satisfied with skyrim again if the book is worth more than 50 gold if we do the main quest lines instead

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.980
then

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:59.820
I would actually be happy with what we've achieved with skyrim and we can oh my god. I forgot there's rats here. Hold on

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:04.220
Oh, I'm getting bit to death. Oh Mars. Oh my god. The swing is so bad

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:08.540
This swing is terrible. I know I should level up. I'm saving it

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:12.220
If you didn't know leveling up actually fully heals you. So if you're ever getting a

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:15.020
In a bit of a pickle

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.020
Why didn't you warn him?

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:20.620
Yes, actually, I wouldn't mind that today. We'll do an endurance stream if that's okay

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.900
Oh, this is freaking terrifying

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:31.660
Oh, he's actually quite a busy boy like honestly

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:34.620
Oh my god, he's just stabbed me

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.660
Wait, something else is red. I don't know. Hi

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.020
Ow, my ankle

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:46.140
Do you know see that big massive spider and you pick on me? You pick on me?

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.940
Right. Hello

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.420
Again

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.420
The rest the rest are winning

01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.580
please

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.540
Please you have this whole chamber and you pick on me

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.140
Red I

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.140
this cold

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:13.340
He's actually one of the stronger enemies in the dungeon be as a script to death and insta dies

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.060
Where's the golden claw?

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.540
It works the claw the markings the door in the hall of stories. I know how they all fit together

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.500
Help me down and I'll show you

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:28.940
Same like a bandit attacking after take down a dragon literally hand over the claw first

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:34.940
Does it look like I could move you have to cut me down. Okay. No, you're kind of real for that. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:40.860
It's coming loose. I can feel it. Hello. I'm sure you wouldn't betray me

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.500
Would you?

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.500
Why should I share the treasure with anyone?

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.220
Why are you are you just leading me there?

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.020
You feel I'm not sharing it with anyone

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.460
Is he about to get

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.460
rolled by a drogger

01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.260
Is he

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:04.460
I knew it. He is wait. Sorry. There's one behind me

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:12.300
He actually does I didn't know he was scripted to do that. I always kill him instantly

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:19.820
I saw mudcrabs the other day horrible creatures. Wait. Yeah, so it's on his person. Should we read his journal?

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.700
Left trigger read

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:28.700
My fingers are trembling the golden claws finally in my hands and with it the power of the ancient nordic heroes that

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:35.980
Fool lucian valerius has no idea that his favorite store decoration was actually the key to bleak falls

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:41.740
Tharu now I just need to get to the hall of stories and unlock the door the legends say

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:45.180
There is a test that the nord's put in place to keep the unworthy way

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:50.380
But that when you have the golden claw the solution is in the palm of your hand

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:57.340
Oh, shit. Okay. I saw that coming. I'm so sorry. I saw that coming. I stood right on that trap

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.340
Oh, shit. Why when I use a stamina move

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:07.500
Stop holding the freaking stamina bar. Holy crap. When I do a stamina move it like makes me go to the side

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:12.060
Literally the only thing that's going to hurt me in this game is um

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.540
Is uh traps nothing else

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.980
Spider girl for gen two

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.700
Hmm

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:31.340
So there's one I don't want to talk about it too much just for my baby girls like

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:36.780
We are only a weekend. Wait, is there a drogger here? I'm a little crazy. No, um

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:43.020
Obviously, I don't want to disrespect the baby girls. Um, I was talking to them

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.100
about like how development works behind the scenes

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:48.460
um

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:53.500
And unfortunately, I used my words pretty poorly and it made some of them a bit uncomfortable

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:59.260
So I don't really like talking about it too much. Um, but it's due to my poor communication

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.820
It's not due to the the girls in any way

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.460
um

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.940
But I what I can say is that

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.940
development takes a year at least

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:13.660
for uh generation

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.860
Like an entire generation if you will

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.860
um

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:23.340
And like I I don't want to say too much to make the girls feel like oh

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:29.420
I'm just like casting them aside because like oh shiny gen two like no, that's absolutely not the case like

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:34.780
I have said this from the start. Um if there is going to be a gen two

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.340
It will be at least a year away like I am

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:43.580
I am not rushing gens out just for the sake of doing it. That's that's so unbelievably disrespectful

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.620
To the girls who have placed faith in me

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.540
um, and

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:53.420
Like I still have a load of plans like now that the girls are in the stage of being monetized. Um

01:13:53.980 --> 01:14:00.860
There's a lot of plans we can now execute. Um, like shorts as well. There's a lot of shorts that need to be made. Um, we have a fantastic

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:06.060
shorts editor who did a Hail Mary to the website and applied themselves

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:10.860
Um, and he's he's been a fantastic shorts editor

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.060
He's pretty much done the majority of the work. We have a a second one

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:19.260
Who's quite busy at the moment, but we are gonna, you know, test if it's all good and if it's all good then

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.620
You know, we've got a lot of shorts play coming up. Um

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.620
confirmed not a black company. I I hope not I

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:32.700
I said to the girls wholeheartedly and hopefully they will voucher. They remember I said something along the lines

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:40.060
I oh, I wasn't paying attention. Sorry. Um, I said if I ever do anything to you that is

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:48.540
Like absolutely hurting you that hurts you in any way that is a completely negative experience with me in any way

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:55.100
Take me out back and shoot me. Um, like it was it's why I was very serious in the interview

01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:59.100
Uh, they they are welcome to talk about the interview if they would like, um, am I going the wrong way?

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.900
Am I going back the way I came? No, I'm not. Um

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.620
I said to them

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:09.980
Do not ever refer to me as your boss. Do not ever think of me as like a superior or something like that

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:12.460
Um, that's definitely not

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:20.220
Ever how I want you to think like I am literally like in this with you. We're we're memeing about we're figuring out what we want to do like, um

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:29.660
Definitely take me out back and shoot me. I'm so serious. Do not ever ever let me like oh, that's

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:34.300
It does more damage. Um, like do not ever take me like

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.140
You know, what's that saying you live long enough to become the villain

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:41.820
Don't ever let me live become don't ever let me live long enough to become the villain

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:43.340
Take me out back and shoot me like oh

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:49.740
It's why from the get go like if the girls sign on their contract for another year. Uh, we the company

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.260
um

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:56.460
We offer an alternative outfit on the house for them as well as their pay increase

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:57.580
goes

01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:02.540
Sorry, I'm fucking try to like remember the the attack pattern and where the droggers spawn in this

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.100
we'll talk about this but um

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:08.780
Like uh, we definitely wanted to raise their income and the split goes

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:13.900
85 15 again kind of showing that we're not really here for grade. We're kind of here for

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.540
alternative reasons. Um

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.420
So is there an actual see oh, I don't own the company

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:23.020
Like I genuinely wholeheartedly my my my name

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.100
I'm

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:31.340
Basically my role is what is a creative director. I already if you look on the

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:36.860
Thingy it'll tell you what the code is but you just need to move these twice and then you've got the correct code

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.860
Unless it's different on pc. Uh, but basically I'm

01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:47.180
I was the creative director because I did used to have the scripts like I used to be the script maker

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:54.220
I no longer have that there's no a manager. All I do right now is stream as strone as me

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:59.660
Um, and I send away shorts like I literally went into the girls dms

01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:02.460
Last night like after streams

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:07.740
And I was like, hey, um, can I get an audio of you saying this and they're like, yeah, I'll do it in the morning

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.820
Like that's that's all I do

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:15.820
Uh, you're a cco. I don't know what a cco is. You're already like the opposite of a black company

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.700
Ah

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.700
I mean you're ready to be dragonborn

01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.300
Word of power learn force

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.940
unrelenting force

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:28.940
force

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:33.260
um, there's always an overlord or um some sort of

01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.500
um

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:41.900
Protector of the words of power, which you know makes sense all things considered

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.540
Uh, oh, we're gonna break that down

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:50.460
Chief creative officer, um

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:56.540
Nah, I've uh, we're just gonna break everything down and

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.900
I think there's a hidden chest by this waterfall

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:03.260
Although I could be completely wrong. Oh, well, no

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:08.460
Damn my memory coming through it's been how many years since I played this game and I'm like, yeah

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:12.300
There's a wee hidden chest here. Then there's this there and then you can pick this up and then I do that

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:15.020
Oh my god. So mlg pro honestly, um

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.020
Wow you a

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:24.140
Cuted that based on honestly force sounds like the german word foo, which means food

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:29.420
Oh, did you like my foos last night? Huh? Did did you like them streams?

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.100
Tell me I don't have I feel so feminine right now

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.660
I'm like the most feminine

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:40.220
I might get more pedicures because honestly that that that was so fun. I enjoyed it

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:45.980
The woman was so like both the women were so lovely. I felt so flustered in that stream though

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.380
I hope it didn't come across too badly

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:54.140
But I was like so out of my element like when I saw the time was an hour until

01:18:54.940 --> 01:19:01.980
A sheepsters was up. I was like, oh my god. What have I done? Like, how did I speedrun it? It's like so quickly

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.140
Have you got back the tool?

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:09.660
Um, it's still unfortunately very

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:16.860
Cut up. So I've still got a wee bandaid on it. I washed it in the bath

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:21.900
Uh, she got me good. All I'm gonna say is she got me good. Like it was deep

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:26.220
You know, like the side the smaller side part of your tool cuts straight into that

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:31.820
She was really sorry though, but it's fine like stuff happens honestly

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.740
And I believe she was new I believe she was new to the establishment. So it's better to

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:40.780
It's better for her to make a mistake on me because like hopefully I'm nice and understanding

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:44.380
And they're like, I wouldn't say anything mean. I was like, oh, you're fine. Like don't worry about it

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.860
Um, and like the other women was like translating for her because she didn't speak English

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:52.380
And I was like, it's fine. So I'm kind of glad she made that mistake on me

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:59.020
Rather than someone else who would have been like a Karen basically like I'm not gonna say anything about Australia, but um

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.540
I have I have heard some

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.540
unique

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:10.940
Conversations occur. I'm not even paying attention to the plot because I'm too busy rambling about my my life. Um

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:13.900
Look forward to the seat stream. Anyway

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:18.460
Who slashed your toe the lady that was doing my pedicure?

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:23.500
Uh, oh god, I'm not like paying attention to the plot. Oh, right. We've just handed over the dragon stone

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.220

The things are back. Uh, this is a map of Skyrim. It's very big. We're in white run right now

Um, we're actually gonna take a horse and carriage and go to rift in because I want to do the thieves guild quest. Yippee

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:40.780

Is winterhold stormcork?

01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:00.140
Solitude is the medium at the legion. It's not

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.500
Hey, ho

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:05.500

Okay, we're listening to plot. Okay

Um, but yes, legendary mode conquest. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, yeah

01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:34.380
I think maybe we'll do just one big endurance Skyrim stream and then tomorrow we'll do monetization

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:37.820
Because since we're not really getting achievements is not really

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.740
Too much need your help again. What do you need my help with?

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:47.980
Oh, yes, sorry, I completely forgot we're about to go get our dragon power

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:54.380
In order to be the dragon born and utilize our powers. We have to perish dragons

01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:02.300
So we're about to get our first shout power winterhold is the stormcork capital. Yeah

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:09.980
The best question. Yeah, we're going to do the thieves guild. We're also going to bring the thieves guild back to its glory

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:16.540
But i'm going to need your guys's help for the tally. Um, you can just run ahead of arolith

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.340
Um, it's not necessary to hang about

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:24.620
Shawnee has the wrong kind of tism to pay attention to multiple things. That was yeah, I can't do that

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.700
I can like hyper

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:33.340
This is they call it hyper focus. I don't think it's even hyper focus. I'm not focused at all. I'm just having a really good time

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:39.900
Um, but yeah, I'm very lucky that I don't experience like burnout or anything. I'm like, yeah, I can't really

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:45.740
Oh, sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that you're having such a tough time. Oh, yeah

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:47.820
um

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:53.500
All right, hold on. I'm gonna unlock this little windmill as a landmarker when you

01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.980
Papaga farm as terrible

01:22:56.380 --> 01:23:01.660
When you discover a landmark you can fast travel to it which gets you

01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.620
Around a lot faster

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.740
um

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:14.380
Did you know that with frostbills you can make dragons land? I did not know that I always use that shout

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.500
Um to get them to land. Oh, it's so pretty. Look at the butterfly

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:24.220
Oh my god catch the butterfly rip its wings off for alchemy

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.940
yes

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.940
Oh

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:35.980
Okay, now we need to wait for the game to hurry up with the mpc. So we're just gonna wait an hour

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.460
Oh, there we go. Boom. Just like that

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.380
No burnout. Look at you

01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:48.860
I just don't experience it. I like I've never experienced that. I've never had issues with that. I don't feel it like

01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:55.180
I can feel tired like I can be like, oh, I need to go get some like tea and some food

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:59.500
And then we'll play like for a couple of more hours. I can do that. No problem. Like at all

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:05.180
I think the only time I feel I just feel frustrated that I don't have more time

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:10.300
Like when I was doing all the ASMR collabs like writing all the scripts back to back

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:16.140
Um, actually I knew girl, uh, I reached out to a new girl and I was like, hey, you want to do ASMR

01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:21.740
And she was like, I want to do some more and she's like, I know a lot about you and I was like, oh, that's embarrassing

01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:27.020
Um, but if you know a lot about me, then you know how easy this collab is gonna be because I'll do all the work

01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:35.340
Um, but like I don't mind doing all the work if anyone's lurking. Uh, I don't mind doing the work. I actually prefer it

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:38.220
Um, because it makes things a lot easier

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.340
And make every arrow count

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:44.700
I used to not experience burnout playing games, but now I do which is a shame

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:49.340
No, so if you can't play video games, that's like life burnout

01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:54.460
Like if you would rather watch someone else play video games than like play it yourself

01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:00.940
Live streaming doesn't count because you're you're being tortured to watch me play Skyrim via

01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:05.100
My controller where the heck is this dragon? Is he on the floor? Oh, it is

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.300
Okay

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.620
Oh, let's spank his butt

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:11.820
Ah

01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:17.580
Whoa, it's actually kind of hurt me a little bit. No, you're stinking. You're so stinking

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.820
Um

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:25.100
See they've been on top. Hey stamina bar is greet out only HP

01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.740
What's the way? Oh, it's landed again

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:30.860
Oh, you're hurting me

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:38.140
Stop it. You're hurting me. Oh look at that two hand is 32. I should probably level that up

01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:43.900
Hey, we are gonna pick up the dragon bones. These are like why on earth? Oh, he must eat a weight ring guard

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.220
um

01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.540
No

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:53.820
So now this is where the NPCs get really weird around you. I don't know what he's fighting right now

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:59.260
He's locked on something a mud crab. Maybe nearby. There's mud crabs over that way

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:06.140
Today I learned from a scottish cut of fish. I may have burned out. Yes. So if you'd rather

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.740
Um, if you would rather

01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:13.020
Um

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.580
Wow

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:23.580
Where that where the heck I think he's supposed to come up to me. Is it you?

01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.860
I'm glad you're on outside

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:38.460
Uh normally an NPC walks up to you and goes oh my god, you are the dragonborn in a really poor like swedish accent

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:40.780
Uh

01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:46.860
What type of two hand are we specializing in hammer axe sword those there's

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:49.980
Aren't those one handed

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.220
I'm just gonna pick up with the apocrity

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:54.780
Apocrity something like that

01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.180
Did he die? I guess they may have perished

01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:05.340
Yeah, I've been uninspired by the games to play recently. So I prefer watching others play. Yes. I think that is a symptom of burnout because of

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.460
Oh

01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:16.780
I think the gray beards have summoned us

01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:20.860
Oh, it's khaji

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:26.380
We're the good boy. Hey, push push push. Do you seek to make a purchase?

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:32.380
Uh, uh, what have you got for sale? I'm gonna just sell some of my stuff that I don't want

01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.980
Uh, I'm gonna break that break it down now

01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:44.540
I'm gonna break all this stuff down. It's just so we're not too heavy. Yeah, I can break those down

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:49.020
Take rid of that. We did that. We're gonna break it down

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:53.020
I've got a brook pass and a Nord mead

01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:59.980
Resurrect and restore my energy. Would I do amber? I'll just sell that. I don't really know

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.620
Oh, I definitely want to sell this

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:07.020
I like how my speech gets better just selling stuff in general like

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:10.940
You always want to hold on to soul gems. Uh, they're very important

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:16.860
May the road lead to oh, that's why I always say safe travels land strider because of this game

01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:19.420
I think it's really cute. Just safe travels land strider

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.620
khaji roleplay stream

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:25.100
Uh

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:29.500
I actually don't know how to purr. You know how some v-tubers can purr like

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:33.580
Uh, I can't do it. I can only roll my r by the pope

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:39.020
Even the graybeards screaming your name strani you absolute sexy player

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.660
Thank you for the tip. Sorry. Yeah, or sorry. Yeah

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.380
I think they're y'all

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:46.620
ebw

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:51.180
Tajita's wearers if you have coin

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:57.740
I told you you're not alone. We're not causing trouble. Uh, so they're looking for

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:04.460
Uh, someone but we're not doing that quest right now because we're trying to zoom past this so we can go and do

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:06.700
the

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.700
Main quest of the dragonborn

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.980
I'm wearing a hat with badass horns

01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:18.460
I'm the dover king known globally. You're nobody at all

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:22.060
He was so english in those songs for no reason

01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:26.700
I'm just kidding. It is his accent. He's allowed to have an accent

01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:33.260
If it's gosh, I'm dover king known globally. You're nobody at all. Like it. Yeah

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:37.900
I think the english rapping accent is a bit better than the scots

01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:41.980
Was the dragon there

01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:48.620
Uh, the watch tower was destroyed, but we killed the dragon. Let's just skip a few dialogue and say it turns out

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.620
I might be dragonborn

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.300
What do you know about the dragonborn?

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:59.340
Hmm when the dragon died, I absorbed some kind of power

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:07.900
The vampire DLC, I don't even think I saw that one the graybeards

01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.580
Okay, okay, okay, we get a blah blah blah blah wait

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:18.700
Why does it say I need to keep? Oh, I need to keep talking to him. You've done a great service for me

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:23.900
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, please gift me axe of white run

01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.340
Oh, I'm stain of the sick

01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:32.780
I am so sorry for creating a mess. That was a misfire. It was a misinput misinput

01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:37.980
Please don't fight me. I didn't mean to do that. I was the wrong the wrong button there

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:43.580
Axe of white on target dies within three second fills the soul gem

01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:46.540
That's perfect because it's exactly the enchantment we want

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.940
Hey, we're gonna break it down now

01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:52.700
Just breaking down everything

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:57.420
Um, and we're gonna see if we can enchant our Nordic battle axe

01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:01.740
Although I even have soul gem. I have the world's weakest soul gem

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:06.780
I'm gonna have to refill it so much if I end up using it

01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.820
Uh

01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:14.940
Uh, this is the best I can do

01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:17.740
Ah freaking mistake

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:23.180
Uh, we're just gonna oh we're completely out of soul gems anyway

01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:32.380
Women yells it. I'm sorry. It was a misinput. It was a misinput. I'm so sorry. Look, I'm the I'm the thane

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:34.700
Anyway, I'm the I'm a thane

01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:38.620
Oh Lydia, do you want to come with us so you can be filled with dragon bones?

01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:44.060
Yarl has appointed me to be your house. Follow me. I need you. Oh my god. Wait. If I got Lydia's face

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:46.140
Am I going crazy or do I have Lydia's face?

01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:49.420
Wait a minute. Did I accidentally recreate Lydia?

01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:52.700
Wait, take take that helmet off right now

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:57.340
I think I may have accidentally recreated Lydia. Oh

01:31:58.460 --> 01:31:59.660
No

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:05.100
I'm I'm such a Lydia fan boy. I recreated her as myself

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:09.020
Oh my god, we even have the same nose and lips and everything

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:16.380
That is hilarious. I'm so sorry Lydia. I'm just such a I must have like subconsciously made her

01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:24.060
This that shoutings making people nervous on it till winning Lydia cuttles for real for real

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:29.980
Right. We now need to go all the way up this mount. Well, we need to go to Rorik's stead

01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:34.220
I versus it. Oh my god. I'm such a fake gamer. Honestly. I don't even know why you guys listen to me half the time

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:43.100
Uh, Tony's copied my whole flow word for word bar for bar. It's a highland coup

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.500
Excuse me little gait. Let me just close that

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:51.900
Let me just close that. Oh, it's the wee highland coup. Look at this. No, uh, whoa. Whoa

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.100
Look at your wee horns

01:32:55.100 --> 01:33:03.740
Fun, uh, I mentioned this other day actually, uh, I had a relative that owned one and uh, the the they're actually super gentle

01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:07.580
Uh, but it made my relative blind in one eye lamal

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:11.500
Because the horn poked his eyeball. Um, that was funny

01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:15.580
Uh, but it wasn't even mad at her

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:20.620
It was a female highland coup. I can't even remember what he named there, but honestly, it sounds like the most scottish

01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:23.740
No, I don't care about your question. Shut the fuck up. Um,

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.460
literally

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:31.660
I honestly must sound so scottish to stream like oh, I have my granddad. Uh used to work in the mines

01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:36.380
Had a family that family member that literally owned a highland coup. Like oh my god

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:41.740
I swear like me wonder I was raised in a bar and literally don't have manners. Like I just I never had it from the start

01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:50.060
A wee coup, a wee highland coup. My favorite part of a strong stream is our unofficial catchphrase. Did you know?

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.940
Oh, did you know?

01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:54.780
Did you know?

01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:58.540
Uh, right, I think we're gonna manually walk there. There are gonna be wolves ahead

01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:04.060
But because we're playing legendary differently and I'm such an MLG pro at this game. Um

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:09.100
It's honestly not problem and we might even see Cicero on the way

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:13.260
It's unlikely we'll meet Cicero on the way there just because he spawns

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:22.220
I find the Cicero spawns more northern west of the map and we are currently going southern east, which is the opposite

01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:23.980
Um

01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:25.900
Lydia

01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:31.580
No, hello. This war is as stupid as our feud with clan gray may need something. No

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:40.940
Oh, oh, she's got a bit of them. Oh, what was that shadow freaking the honeybearing meadery. Uh, yes a bit of a bit of meadery

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:44.380
Oh, wait, will we open a veal or a meadery? Why not?

01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:47.740
that seems to be the way of like

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:49.340
um

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:53.420
Content creators when they get in their endgame they like come out with a product. I'm like

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:58.140
I think my endgame would be video games like

01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:02.620
Like paying to get them made like what what my my rubbish ideas are

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.700
Um, I think that's probably my endgame. Whoa, okay

01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:11.820
That was that was a lot going on the screen for one for one. So

01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:16.540
That was quite a lot. There is a waystone up ahead. I don't think it's a good one

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:19.420
Haggis and

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:22.220
Neeps and ties

01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.780
Do you also live in a lone tower up on some hill? Are you?

01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:33.340
Wait, oh, no, is this an enemy dog? No, it's a nice dog. Hello. I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years

01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:37.420
I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years

01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:44.380
Are you telling me my lore story is shrek right now? You can buy dragon scale. You've not got the money for it

01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:46.780
our

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:48.780
Wah, wah, wah

01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:52.460
The other drinks it may or may not contain something

01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:57.660
Unique to the girl. I see that skeever on the road. Don't think I can't see you. We are

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:02.700
Oh, so captured that that is the noise. I like to hear honestly

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:06.380
Uh, I believe there's a few skeletons up on this hill, but

01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:08.940
Again, nothing we can't handle

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.100
Nothing we can't handle at all

01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:16.300
Um, as I said, we're gonna do the main quest. We're gonna do the thieves

01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:21.980
Um, and then hello, are you you are definitely an enemy? Oh

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:27.580
I do beg your pardon, but it's all the way absolutely nothing around these parts

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:32.620
And another soul capture do you have soul gem?

01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:36.460
Spark white cap will destroy those. Oh

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:38.540
Oh

01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.540
Oh, how dare you

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:41.820
Do you?

01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:46.540
Oh, wait, I think that ancient that ancient bow is stronger than what we have for our bow. Um

01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:51.580
Right root skeletons scared. Oh scary

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:56.060
Are you squiddling me right by the pope?

01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:01.260
I don't like my family history every time I read my family history

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:04.540
I always have to ask myself. Are we the bad guys?

01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:06.940
Monka is

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:08.940
Thank you for the tip

01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.740
Are we the bad news

01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:14.300
I think my family history is like really boring

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.500
It's just like, yeah

01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:19.820
Scottish and Irish

01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:25.660
I know that you can do like 23 and me tests to like really see where you come from

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.420
But I actually don't uh, I don't

01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:34.220
Believe it's safe at all to like willingly hand over your dna like that

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:39.100
Look, I know I'm starting to send like needy streamer overload where we were doing like that god speed run

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:45.100
Where she you know, she got into like all the conspiracy theories and stuff, but it's not really a conspiracy thing

01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:48.860
I like maybe I should do a stream like that on ironically

01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:55.260
I'll like yeah. Um, wait, what are you attacking? You're not attacking me. Oh, you're not. Okay, that's strange

01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:59.820
Uh, this gaily sounded like an oblivion scaly

01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:02.780
At least you got a cool accent out of the deal. Yeah

01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:10.140
Um, we are just running our way over to mvark said I believe is the town name award you kind of forgot the annunciation

01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.340
Um

01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:17.100
No, I don't think it's safe either to have your dna on fail of a company. Yeah, like

01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:19.260
um

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.260
I took like ethics class

01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:22.540
um

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.220
and we were

01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:31.500
Discussing like how good like emergent technology is like if you haven't heard about crisper is dna fixing technology

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:39.340
Essentially dna fixing. Um, it's going through a lot of lab studies and trials and all that but it's found very effective against like, um

01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:45.740
You know things that were previously incurable essentially or diseases that are

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.860
untreatable that kind of thing um and

01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:53.580
The technology that can be raised from it

01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:59.580
Um to help people is outstanding. However, do we

01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:02.460
Do we trust such?

01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:07.740
Do we trust your dna sequence to be handled with care or would in theory

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:14.620
Insurance help. I'm sorry. I'm literally hell. Yeah. I'm up for scotland conspiracy theory stream

01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:22.540
Thank you so much. Totally not big anger. Um, like I I could definitely get into it, but we were like talking about like

01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:29.260
Uh, didn't see one of the interest your companies get caught selling all the data. They said they wouldn't is that yes

01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:31.660
uh, not to mention, um

01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:38.140
There's like a whole rabbit hole about what data leaks are. Um, because

01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:40.860
um

01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:46.540
I don't know. I don't know if you guys care, but um, there's actually a whole other conspiracy

01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:53.020
Um, that data leaks aren't actually like that. It's kind of more like government demands

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:56.700
Uh to have access, but they already kind of have access to a lot of things

01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:59.100
Especially with the technology in the state age

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:04.620
But uh, maybe I shouldn't go too far down the rabbit hole. Don't want to deter anyone. Where the heck am I supposed to go?

01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.140
I think there's a path ahead. I'll just follow this path. Um,

01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:13.580
I thought we were going down the designer baby route. Oh, well that already happened

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:19.340
One of the biggest examples of the designer baby route was victoria beckham's children

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:25.420
You're telling me that brown-eyed lady has a 25 percent of uh, blue-eyed offspring

01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:29.580
And she just happened to pop out two blue-eyed children. Uh, no

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:36.700
She did what is called ivf and then the dna tested and checked if the children

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:39.660
And in the egg in the egg. Yes in the egg

01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:44.060
Uh, we're able to uh had the recessive blue eyes

01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:50.220
Is already being done in this day and age and that was back in 2005 or something crazy. It's one of the biggest public

01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:55.020
Things that are right in the faces of people that you wouldn't know about it's already occurring today

01:40:55.100 --> 01:41:01.100
This also occurs with the fox p12 gene. I believe I'm so sorry if no one cares about this

01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:05.980
But I'll try and get through it really quickly. There's also a gene that's been identified called the fox p12

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:06.780
I believe

01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:12.700
Um, and if you have it it means you're actually a lot smarter and able to pick up things a lot easier than someone who is

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:18.700
Without this gene and uh, it's been called into question that ivf babies may also be getting tested for this

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:21.580
So you have a child or offspring that may be a bit smarter than the average

01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:25.020
But that's just on me. Okay, uh, I'll just leave it

01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:28.620
Leave it there, but there there's a lot. There's a lot

01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:30.860
Okay

01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:31.820
um

01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:34.860
It's really interesting to continue the happen. Yes

01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:40.940
So a lot of people think it hasn't already occurred or the first human hasn't been cloned and dolly the first sheep was cloned in

01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:44.140
1964 I believe uh the no no no no no

01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:49.260
That's when we first were publicly allowed to be learned and to be taught about the cloning

01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:53.100
Um, it's already happened long ago

01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:58.140
You just don't get to know about it because ethnically it's messed ethnically

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:06.700
Ethically it's messed up and the public shouldn't really be allowed to access this knowledge because well it brings up a lot of questions

01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.100
Such as if you call in a person

01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:10.140
Do they have one soul?

01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:12.700
Do they share a soul and then it brings religion into question

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:17.180
If you didn't know religion also helps bring in a lot of order into people's and communities lives

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:19.260
And the rabbit hole goes incredibly deep

01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:22.860
But we can't touch on that subject too much because i'm just a vtuber playing skyrim right now

01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:28.300
And we're just trying to get to every head so we can talk to the graybeards to learn about our true power as the dragonborn

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:30.460
As we play this game

01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:35.260
So yes, please don't mind me

01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.140
Oh, this is a saber cat after me. My goodness

01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:40.460
um

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:42.460
But yes, uh, please

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:48.220
Please let us enjoy skyrim for what it is. Anyway, that's why I don't really start talking about these subjects

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:50.540
because uh

01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:52.060
Yeah, it's uh

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:56.060
It's a bit scary. It's a bit scary when you look into it. Yeah, right? Uh, yeah

01:42:56.860 --> 01:43:00.620
Gamers for genetically engineered cat girls represent absolutely

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:05.740
I'm 100% there with you the fact that nickel girls aren't real. I used to right. This sounds really bad

01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:09.180
I used to actually fantasize about owning a nickel girl. I don't know why I just

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:13.340
I used to fantasize about like treating her really well

01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:18.780
And like she would have had a previous owner before me or something, but i'll treat you right baby

01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:24.620
I don't know why I gave me like some sort of like superior like saving complex or something

01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:29.500
I don't know why but like I just oh I used to fantasize about all of that

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:33.660
Like especially after watching monster monster

01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.220
mom

01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:39.260
Um, I used to like really

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:44.140
Uh, there should be a quest where you deliver something for someone

01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:47.340
Is it you?

01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:52.060
Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop. Oh, okay, right. Sorry, jeez

01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:54.860
Um

01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:59.500
If this dream doesn't demonstrate that the tism is strong and veal or literally to the box

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.900
There's someone that gives you a quest

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.700
Okay, we're gonna yet if you talk to this guy you can do a quest for him

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:19.260
Um

01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:21.260
There's also a hidden

01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:22.940
Thing

01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:26.060
If you read all of these on the way up something happens

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:30.460
But I've completely forgotten what happens because I've never done it before because I saw it in a video

01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:32.700
And I've forgotten what happened in the video

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:39.580
Uh, right, let's see emblem one before the birth of men the dragons ruled all of

01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:41.980
Mondus their words

01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:47.260
Their word was the voice and they spoke only for true needs

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:51.260
For the voice could blot out the sky and flood the land

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:57.260
Well four years means more years to tease

01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:04.620
Honestly what necopara does to mf for me honestly

01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:10.860
Damn strongy the last 10 minutes rumbles deaf and I'm so sorry

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:16.220
Thank you. Hypno mama. Thank you for us dino. I apologize

01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:19.500
Just saying cloning has never been perfect

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:23.660
And there has been a growth in mental health as time has gone on

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:30.140
We are all clones of our grandfathers grandmothers, but imperfect to poison the king cool

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:36.780
Thank you. Thario for the tip. I could talk about um, so you know how like the older generations thing is like

01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:40.300
Oh the lead paint stair because they'd been exposed to lead so much

01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:41.980
um

01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.460
My freaking biggest thing is that they've known about micro plastics forever

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:51.580
And uh, I actually got proven right. It has been supra. Wait, did I miss an emblem?

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:56.940
No, I didn't hello. How are you?

01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:02.860
I did

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:09.420
He's so cold. Yeah, maybe because your arms are out and you have your stomach is out and I can see your nip-nip like of course

01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:10.460
You're cold

01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:16.940
Right, let's read emblem two. Oh emblem two men were born and spread over the fate. Did I thank those tips?

01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:42.140
Theodore, I don't know. I'm just like what short what shorthand for toward Todd Toddery

01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:45.340

Row row give me row row row your boat gently turn the stream medley medley medley medley hope it's like a dream

01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:05.740
Todd is short for Todd Ali foolish shite

02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:12.140
What where did that come from right demonstrate your unrelenting shout

02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:17.500
Is it this way open skyrim

02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:24.940
Toddster the Todd meister Todd room wait. I've gone the wrong way. I wish you wouldn't do that

02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:31.020
All right, I'm supposed to do on this. Okay. Let's not hit the

02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:41.180
Game I thought it was a little easier on PC, but I guess the PC and the Xbox bugs are the exact freaking same

02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:48.380
It just works in fact it does not actually work at all

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:50.460
Oh the poor basket is going everywhere

02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:55.180
This poor old man are gonna have to pick them up because I'm being naughty and shouting all over the place

02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:58.780
It's short for Todd's vision

02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:02.140
It just

02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:08.940
It's weird not hearing the fistful da part the da

02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:16.780
It's just sounds like a dog barking

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:23.340
Ah

02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:34.620
What now what now what now did I go see parthas yet? Let me see parthas. Let me see parthas

02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:37.900
We will perform your next

02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:40.860
Master body

02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:42.940
Ori Glein

02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:50.060
Oh my god, I can't believe it never been this far away from home. Oh my god. I can't believe

02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:52.540
Never been this far away from home

02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:57.260
Hey, you do have to wait for the NPCs to go through the door because if you go through the door first for some reason

02:01:57.260 --> 02:01:59.580
They don't show up on the other side unless you want to wait

02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:05.900
But we need to assist the man through the door. They're there. There you go into the yep into the court

02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:10.300
You're up right despawned right. I'm happy with that. I definitely confirmed a despawn

02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:13.340
I like to

02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:17.820
Shout it shout it. I like to shout it shout it. I like to shout it

02:02:18.780 --> 02:02:20.620
No

02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:24.860
Todd is meant to be the name for the president of the cheese club who is so fooled himself

02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:30.780
He thinks starfield is a good game worth a what is going on with starfield

02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:38.860
I saw a clip of someone taking someone's ship and someone was like they just stole his in real life money or something

02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:41.980
Because he took a ship that was in game

02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:45.180
I don't know what's going on with starcraft citizens

02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:48.060
But I hope you guys are doing okay out there because I don't I don't

02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:51.980
Nothing

02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:57.820
Right, okay, we're all wins. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I was a bit. I was a bit excited to do that one. I apologize

02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:59.900
I was a wee bit excited, right? Oh

02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:02.540
You can't change shout. We'll shout it

02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:05.900
Oh, I don't have a soul yet

02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:11.580
Wrong game. Oh wait. Oh star citizen and starfield are different eeps

02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:15.820
The one where it's been in production for like 12 billion years

02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:19.340
Not to be dramatic, but 12 billion years is how long it's been

02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:27.500
Are you ready you want to see how fast I am I am speed

02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:32.620
Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, baby

02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:36.300
One world one spring

02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:42.620
Oh, sorry wrong one. Oh wait, I wasn't supposed to do that with them

02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:50.940
Uh, wait, hold on I need to recharge my shower lydia, please a little to the right lydia lydia

02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:53.660
I'm looking to the right doll face

02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:58.460
Like I know you're a bit daft in the head. That's why you're uh cell sword

02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:05.980
I just I just head bomb talk about an upgrade to the Glasgow kiss. Oh my goodness

02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:08.940
Don't

02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:12.540
Not my premature first

02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:17.740
One minute 56 beat that I bet you can't

02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:21.100
I thought it was easy for everyone

02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:25.020
Oh my gosh, you see that's why it's just someone legendary

02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:28.540
Right now what

02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:30.300
Now what

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:33.580
What the heck is it the horn one? I think it may be the horn one. You know that

02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:36.380
Hold on let me check that is retrieved the horn

02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:44.140
Now we can ignore that and go and do the thieves guild which is much more exciting in my humble opinion

02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:50.220
So let's go all the way doing this hell and we'll finish this little miscellaneous and then we'll go to the thieves guild

02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:56.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

02:04:56.620 --> 02:05:00.460
I get so annoyed with these guys because they always end up killing NPCs

02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:06.220
You need to drag the cultists out of any environment because they always kill NPCs

02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:10.300
And you can't resurrect the freaking thing. So you need to wait until they come and attack you

02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:12.780
Get ready

02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:14.780
Prepare yourself

02:05:19.580 --> 02:05:21.580
There's so annoying

02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:24.460
You're no one they call dragonborn

02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:30.620
Yeah, the great beards. Yes, I am your lies fall on deaf ears deceiver

02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:36.540
The true dragonborn comes you are but he's shadow. You are but he's shadow

02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:41.420
All shall bear witness. I shall stand to oppose him

02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:46.140
Right, right Lydia Lydia

02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:50.060
Please do not kill any of the guards. I'm gonna be so annoyed

02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:53.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah perish

02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:55.900
super

02:05:55.900 --> 02:05:59.260
Okay, Lydia got smacked up, but she's okay. That's good

02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:06.220
We'll take that. Oh, well, what do you can add destroy? Oh, I can destroy these for a level up

02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:10.300
Oh, I'll take that. I'll take that. Oh, look at that. I'll take that

02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:19.660
Yes, I um dragonborn actually funny you mentioned that in passing. Yeah, I'm actually the dragonborn the one you

02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:22.620
You're the hey. Yeah, we got the DLCs too. Whoa

02:06:23.980 --> 02:06:25.500
I don't want to

02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:27.500
What time is it? Oh wake up

02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:32.700
Wake up. Oh my that actually really hurt my hands. I don't know if you heard me

02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:35.500
Smack my bone on the table to try and make that noise

02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:41.820
Is this a fresh run it is we're just gonna be doing the best quests

02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:47.180
Which is the main quest and thieves guild and then because I completely

02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:50.220
Messed it up like a dum-dum-dummy-dum-dum-dum

02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:56.940
Ah, good to see you. I delivered the supplies. Wasn't it? It was anyway much appreciated

02:06:57.420 --> 02:07:00.140
Here take this for your troubles. Thank you

02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:07.900
Uh, oh, I got 500 coin. Honestly, that's decent. We're gonna pick up ninroot because I'm pretty sure there's a ninroot quest at a later date

02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:10.380
Uh, right. We're gonna check the map

02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:13.500
Uh, and we're gonna go directly east

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:16.460
Because that is where

02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:19.180
DLC 2

02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:23.260
Oh my god cute fragile girl, bro

02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:26.940
I could hardly open those freaking cans of fizzy juice yesterday

02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:30.220
I was actually getting embarrassed and then I couldn't even open up the kisses either

02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:36.700
I was like freaking straining for my life. Thankfully my my sweaty hands came in clutch when it came to the crisps

02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:40.700
Uh, oh, excuse me. Just going for a swim casually. I'm

02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:48.140
Uh, 500 quid is like literally so good honestly. That's like such a big booster start in the game

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:51.260
Uh, right

02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:53.740
Redmond's hall. I don't like the sound of that

02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:58.620
Hey, we are just gonna try and discover the landmarks on the way. Oh wait, we can can we just use our

02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:01.660
Okay, we can just use our ultimate to get a bit faster

02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:04.700
The cultist are from myriac still see

02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:08.780
I don't like that one. We can maybe do vampire quest lane as well

02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:16.060
Vampire thieves guild and main quests where the storm cloaks win in the end. Yes, please

02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:19.980
I think I will be very satisfied with their Skyrim adventures doing that

02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:22.860
I'm clear cut and we're not kind of

02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:25.660
Stuck on the hill. Come on. There we go. Uh

02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:29.340
That definitely because

02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:33.580
They're freaking actually that's another thing. Uh, Todd. Why make

02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:40.060
Serena in the first place if I can't marry her like I'm not being funny, but probably one of the best characters

02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:44.300
Please leave me alone. I don't want any trouble. Okay. I'm just passing through

02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:46.700
um

02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:48.940
But there's done their amazing side quest honestly

02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:53.740
You should always pick ninroot. It's the only plant that is limited in the game. Oh

02:08:54.620 --> 02:09:01.340
Are you gonna do the assassin guys quest the dark brotherhood? Actually, I really enjoy the dark brotherhood. We might end up doing that as well

02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:09.340
Was it sweet mother sweet mother send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear

02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:11.980
I remember watching that for the first time

02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:17.900
And just being blown away like I loved everything about uh

02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:24.300
I'm going to such a such an edgy little child such an edgy little beast

02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:27.260
um

02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:32.380
Todd didn't want players to have too much fun and they couldn't keep buying the new versions of Skyrim honestly

02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:40.380
Uh, there is a forest ahead. I think after the forest is uh, oh look at the rabbit. Goodbye

02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:45.980
Oh, I made a noise. I actually feel bad now. I'm not doing that again

02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:51.660
If it didn't make a noise, I'd be all right. But because it made a noise. I actually generally feel really bad

02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:54.940
Just a bit

02:09:55.260 --> 02:10:00.780
You know that vampire woman sara. I think that's her name. She can become human serena

02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:05.420
Why am I so high up? Where am I?

02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:13.340
Oh, I'm on the freaking outskirts of the map rifting here, right? That'll be why I can't go any higher

02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:15.980
But I can go higher. Why can I go higher?

02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:21.820
Right

02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:23.820
What?

02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:26.540
Wait, there's a pair. Oh, that's Lydia

02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:30.540
I was like, why is there NPCs like all the way up here? Where are they?

02:10:31.420 --> 02:10:34.780
What why is this wait? There's like a genuinely a path here though

02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:38.780
I'm looking crazy. Have I even been here before?

02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:48.380
Whoa, okay, we've got hunters. That's fine. Oh, there's a dragon thing up ahead

02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:55.660
There's like way more south side. It looks like the end. Good hunt

02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:20.380
Oh

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:23.900
I'm in a trance right now. I'm so sorry

02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:43.980
Where am I genuinely what?

02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:46.940
Oh

02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:49.260
Don't do that

02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:56.700
Oh, there's rifting. Okay. I was getting so confused. I've literally just came the most difficult way possible

02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:03.660
I was getting so confused. I'm like, I could have sworn rifting was east southeast

02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:09.500
I literally isn't I can't believe I just did that. I almost just flew myself off that

02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:14.460
Oh, this is the scooma then. Oh, I love this quest so much

02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:20.540
Okay

02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:26.220
Again book is worth 50. So we got a level up. Uh, she be cotton bum is live right now

02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:29.100
If you're sick of Todd Howard winning again

02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:31.740
Uh, yeah, okay, dummy

02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:34.620
That is an elk. No, it's a wool

02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:37.340
Oh

02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:43.580
Gone the most difficult way yet. It's literally the horse is currently

02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:45.980
um

02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:51.660
Vertical on the mountainside type of pathing because that I couldn't have made it any worse if I tried

02:12:54.620 --> 02:13:00.140
Trying to do some scooma. Oh my god, would you do scooma with me at the next convention?

02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:05.980
Have the next feature reconvention list of scooma. I don't even know what it's supposed to do or mimic

02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:09.980
I guess supposed to maybe mimic um barrel bine

02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:13.340
um

02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:18.540
Yeah, because everyone seems zonked out barrel bine makes you very, um

02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:22.540
Sedated in nature. We're

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:25.340
Right rifting

02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:27.340
There's a wolf below me again

02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:33.740
I'm just decimating the wolf population. Honestly skyrim's just scotland before they eradicated the world

02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:37.340
She can't convince me otherwise like right. I'm pretty sure

02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:42.780
If we discover. Yeah, this is the first, um thieves thing

02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:48.060
Farted and almost dies from fall damage 10 out of 10 far

02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:55.020
Actually, I haven't been in chibi stream. I'm a go over there for the first time. Yeah, give it give my gen mates a shout

02:13:55.340 --> 02:14:03.100
A shout give them a shot. Um, they're absolutely fantastic in their own special way. Um, if you like burps

02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:05.180
she bees your gal

02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:07.020
um

02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:10.140
I feel like variety little sisters emmies you gal

02:14:11.180 --> 02:14:16.620
If you like adorable brats, uh, that'll call you an old man and tease you and you can tease her back

02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:18.700
Aces you gal

02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:22.380
Uh, if you want to be babied as well as your gal

02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:29.260
Uh, and if you want to be uh, I don't know. What would mercy's if you want to be?

02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:32.940
Uh

02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:38.300
If you want a jealous experience

02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:41.340
watch mercy

02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:42.620
and then

02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:47.740
I think someone described me as like the neighbor from next door that doesn't mind you

02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:50.460
placing your hand

02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:52.540
On a round object

02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:57.340
And I was like honestly. Yeah, that's pretty good pretty good, uh description

02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:04.060
Yes, there's she be live if you'd like to have a have a chicken. I don't know what game she's playing

02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:08.300
Senpai to yander. Yeah, Azura called her

02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:11.340
Bing Bongs. Oh

02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:15.020
Like hbh bros are getting looked after I saw him saying

02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:22.300
She be is talking. Yes, you get

02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:29.260
Before I let you in to rift. Yeah. Yeah visitors tax. How about we do a little persuasion

02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:34.060
For the privilege of entering the city. This is obviously a shake down

02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:40.700
Keep your boys down my speeches 22. I don't know about you

02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:43.580
My speeches

02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:49.180
I had another there she is. This is the person I normally wife

02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:53.820
But then again, I've become the head of the thieves guild and she absolutely despises it

02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:57.180
You're not from rifting

02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:00.620
My travels have taken me from high

02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:08.700
Morrowind at all points in between. Why are you here then many years ago? I lost my you and I I see

02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:11.020
Grimm's weeper so with

02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:12.780
um

02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:14.780
Oh, this guy shakes his down as well

02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:20.620
Looking for trouble. Um, I'm I'm just passing. I'm not scared of you

02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:23.100
That's the wrong answer

02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:28.620
Last thing the black briars need around here is some troublemaker trying to steal a piece of the action

02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:34.860
Who are the black briars have ripped it in their pocket and the thieves guild watching their back

02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:38.140
So keep your nose out of their business. Why are you telling me all this for free?

02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:45.740
I'm maul. I watch the streets for them if you need dirt on anything. I'm your guy, but it'll cost you

02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:51.980
You're just begging for a pagan aren't you? I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that and then you're stupider

02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:56.060
My persuasion check failed

02:16:57.340 --> 02:16:58.620
eat

02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:00.220
Eat

02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:03.260
I'm really getting tired of your excuses. Yeah, like everyone

02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:07.500
Uh, it's like, okay. This is the start

02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:13.180
But everyone wants to talk to you at once when you enter rift and I have to admit

02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:19.580
It's a bit of a sensory bit of a cheeky sensory overload entering in your city in skyrim. Everyone wants to talk to you

02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:26.620
Right, uh, how could you possibly know that that I'm a thief the way they want

02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:30.620
Right, I'm going to tell you something you should absolutely not do

02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:36.780
Maybe you'd like a taste the game is going to ask you to plan a ring on this person

02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:39.980
And it locks him up in jail and removes

02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:44.140
Um, a cellar from rifting don't do it

02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:48.460
Don't do it. Okay

02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:53.660
If you do it, it removes him as a cellar and it's like another 800 coins

02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:59.260
You can't get from selling stuff these symbols you see around the city. Um, these are thieves guild symbols

02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:00.780
You'll see them everywhere

02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:06.380
It means this place has been marked or there's something of value inside like you'll see the symbols everywhere

02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:11.900
Um, you always want to fail this quest. It doesn't matter if you feel that you still get to become a part of the thieves guild

02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:14.620
and

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:19.500
Oh, he's not started his dialogue clearly because uh, that should have done it

02:18:27.260 --> 02:18:32.300
Why am I being told to join the rebellion? I didn't do anything. Oh come on. Hurry up

02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:38.460
Oh freaking the sake I have to let the dialogue actually run out. Um

02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:46.460
Hello, you're having some problems with that thieves guild person. What do you want? What kind of trouble are you in?

02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:51.500
Tell me the details

02:18:55.660 --> 02:19:01.980
I hate that you can't just skip the initial quest honestly. No, no, I'm a murderer who will not think big difference, mate

02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:06.060
Shawnee is the whole package replaying. What?

02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:12.380
I'll help you pay off your debt. Oh, thank you speak to sapphire about shaders debt

02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:18.300
A voice in your head told you that there's so many sellers in rifting

02:19:18.940 --> 02:19:25.260
There are but if you want quick access oh for goodness sake bring y'all wrap it up, buddy

02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:29.180
Like this is getting it. They just make

02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:35.180
That was

02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:39.740
I am Lydia

02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:42.540
The right hand of the thing of white run

02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:48.700
Oh come on me just fail it so we can start the thieves quest

02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:54.380
He's a jeweler too. Yeah, definitely especially when you level up your um speech

02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:57.020
You can sell to like anyone which is so good

02:19:57.500 --> 02:20:02.620
Time to go night night have fun in skyrim rest well see you in the morning when you wake up

02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:11.100
We're not even started the thieves quest. Come on. I'll discover this building because I've not discovered it

02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:18.300
Oh come on fail it. Okay. That looks like I failed it surely

02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:21.020
You

02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:27.340
Not the coughing is anyone even doing anything bring y'all

02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:39.260
No one is talking or interacting when I'm done here. I'd be more than happy to sell you an elixir

02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:46.700
You must be all right if you've got time to come I haven't brought on xbox. It's not this broken

02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:53.980
Just what you see here what's he got for sale? He's got 700 coins so we can actually empty our inventory with him a little bit

02:20:54.940 --> 02:20:56.940
I don't want to get too heavy

02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:01.980
Uh, we don't really need any of that

02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:09.740
Just uh get rid of it all why not? Oh, who's burping who goes there identify yourself?

02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:15.900
Okay, I don't think I can destroy a staff. Oh my god this come on

02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:19.260
Good old scum

02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:27.980
Right if he's not gonna let me fail that I'll move on to um

02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:32.620
Austin grave a bit of Austin gravey

02:21:33.900 --> 02:21:35.820
In the micro wavy

02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:38.700
Did he purchase dragon skills from you? Yeah, he did

02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:41.740
You can pretty much convince him to do whatever

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:45.580
especially um one of the speech perks is

02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:48.220
actually

02:21:48.620 --> 02:21:50.620
having

02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:54.220
Uh being able to sell at any point

02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:57.920
Shawnee you have her boar swords in her shields and you have my clock

02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:06.460
Oh Ninroo I hear it

02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:13.820
There's a question say uh black reach

02:22:14.780 --> 02:22:21.660
Which is um, I just realized this giant can fly me halfway across the map. So it should probably be a bit more careful

02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:33.420
Um, hey, how's Shawnee going chilling in my family's loving room watching lol. It's going good. Um, we're just trying to fail the thieves guild quest

02:22:34.060 --> 02:22:39.020
So we are purposely is there a mall in my room? Hold on. I'm about to scream

02:22:39.980 --> 02:22:44.940
Is there a mall? I'm not being pranked. I think my eyeballs are pranking me. Okay. I think I'm okay

02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:47.740
Okay, I'm okay. I'm safe. Um

02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:51.340
What was I saying?

02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:53.340
um, we're just going to

02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:59.580
Continue the dragonborn quest line at the moment because we are trying to freaking get the

02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:02.300
Uh

02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:05.820
Why are you attacking me? I didn't do anything

02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:09.900
Well, you started it. I'm me. Um, I'ma end it

02:23:11.980 --> 02:23:14.620
I love how fast like they fall back

02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:19.260
So, no, no, don't don't try and escape. You started it

02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:24.140
You uh, right. I'm not actually needing to fight here. We'll just go skip ahead

02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:29.020
It said it's already failed wait because I moved away

02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:35.180
You stinking game you honestly, right we'll do the thief skill thing

02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:38.540
Uh, wait, it doesn't even

You can't fast travel while there's oh, you know what this game's such a troll sometimes

Can I like hate from them can they even see me

02:23:53.340 --> 02:23:57.660
Come on, I'm gonna end up activating a mud crab and then I won't be able to like fly away

02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:00.460
Oh

02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:05.820
Look they shouldn't bow now is that me from here. It's quite the distance

02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:10.540
So and he's like bobby bee

02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:15.420
Caving in our man's breastplate with a single swing of the hammer

02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:18.940
Uh, yeah

02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:21.500
There's bobby bee bobby bee

02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:24.060
bobby bee

02:24:25.020 --> 02:24:28.380
Um to save time you're best going to the Mesterville

02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:31.580
Crip keep

02:24:32.140 --> 02:24:38.380
Just to save a few precious where the heck why right take everything else off. We're doing this quest only

02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:45.420
Bring you off. I literally had to teleport away and didn't be annoyed. Just how long did you expect me to keep those people distracted?

02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:47.660
Why are you going in here?

02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:50.620
You don't

02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:53.180
He doesn't live in here

02:25:07.740 --> 02:25:11.500
Um, maybe we get some food and a cup of tea shortly

02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:16.700
Taking if you're up to the challenge. I've actually had no water. I've not even finished my first thing. All right, then

02:25:17.420 --> 02:25:19.420
Let's put that to the test

02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:25.100
The group I represent has its home in the ratway beneath Riftwood the tavern called the ragged flag

02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:30.700
Get there in one piece and we'll see if you've really got we've finally started the quest

02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:33.660
Uh

02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:41.420
We'll go down to the flag and and then we'll take a quick pause so I can

02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:44.220
Peep and make some food

02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:49.740
Guess what I've got lasagna. That's right. I can cook

02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:54.940
When I when I have like really short streams. I get so much done

02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:58.060
Hey, there are enemies, but they're really not that bad

02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:01.100
It's a shame you even have I see use

02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:05.580
Stop using a sword. That's a shield. That's cheating

02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:08.700
You such cheater me cheater

02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:15.340
Uh, I think no wait leave it out. There's skewers

02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:24.060
You can cook honestly, I know it probably sounds like I can't I normally just trap this to do the skewer

02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:26.220
Oh, I let myself on fire with a gun

02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:31.420
Whoa, that was supposed to deal with a rat, but I guess not

02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:35.660
Uh, there is a guy with fisticuffs in here

02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:40.620
Peeler

02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:45.420
How dare you? All right, I'll destroy those so we can get um

02:26:46.380 --> 02:26:48.380
That's an alchemy table

02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:49.020
Oh

02:26:49.020 --> 02:26:52.220
I keep doing that. I've got them on the wrong way that I used to have them

02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:54.700
I'm just gonna eat a lot of stuff. Don't mind me

02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:58.140
Okay, there we go

02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:01.740
I just need a test and see what it does

02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:10.780
Just a random sword. There's nothing special about the sword. I'm not really sure what's that. Whoa

02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.100
Someone there

02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:17.820
Ah

02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:26.380
I remember those guys being so tough and legendary. I don't know how you beat them so well. Look, it's okay to admit

02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:30.300
It's okay. Just I'm just so mlg pro

02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:37.900
Just eat 50 lb's of food to regain your HP literally right where the ragged full on again. He had

02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:41.340
Ragged on his fun again. That's the best I got

02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:43.340
Those days are over

02:27:43.580 --> 02:27:45.580
Well, well look at the fit

02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:52.460
I wasn't certain whenever you guys call me last. This is who I hear in my head when you're like, yes last

02:27:53.340 --> 02:27:55.340
Getting here was easy

02:27:55.980 --> 02:27:57.980
Reliable and headstrong

02:27:58.300 --> 02:28:03.100
You're turning out to be quite the prize. So I'm a prize. Now that I've whetted your appetite

02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:05.100
Refilling your price

Dead beat our organization some Syrian. I want you to explain sounds good

I don't good

02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:25.980
We're literally going to go beat them up for thingy. Um

02:28:27.580 --> 02:28:33.020
We can get back faster at least but we don't have access to the the secret ending yet

02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:36.940
Stop you're the prize. No you

Oh my god, I'm learning

02:29:41.660 --> 02:29:46.300

02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:17.540
tell us to go do a quest where we manipulate and a competitor to her brewery and which is quite

02:51:17.540 --> 02:51:24.980
a unique one because of what goes on inside the quest quick question is our way to get into the

02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:32.020
these girl treasury not that I know of and other than doing the quest line where it opens up and

02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:43.820

02:51:43.820 --> 02:51:58.700
should I call a break should we do it wait hold on me let me finish my war oh that was

02:51:58.700 --> 02:52:04.540
top water yeah I don't really find a top war yeah when I have it in tea I guess it covers up all

02:52:04.540 --> 02:52:12.780
the flavor I work with my mother to sell first time vegetable that anyone are you okay I know it's

02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:16.100
scary I know it's scary to go into a new place for the first time but you'll be all right hand

02:52:16.100 --> 02:52:28.180
the new buddy oh my gosh I love it I love this game so much I'm a hello hello hello

02:52:28.180 --> 02:52:36.380
can't a man drink in peace geez you looks his eyes are gone like I shadow on I'm gonna keep this

02:52:37.340 --> 02:52:45.660
owner so we're to basically poison the bat from a meadery in order to get this guy arrested

02:52:45.660 --> 02:52:55.420
it's pretty pretty yeah it's pretty deep plot I have to admit the plot is so deep like it's

02:52:55.420 --> 02:53:07.180
probably I'd say an average of five inches deep of this plot and I will make a tea and get some

02:53:07.180 --> 02:53:10.180
food in me because I think I'm starting to go slightly delirious because I've not had anything

02:53:10.180 --> 02:53:15.660
I'm supposed to be holding a tasting at the new hunting so if he sees the meadery in this state

02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:25.020
there's currently skevers and at his meteorite and we're gonna offer well that's not how I operate

02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:34.300
you better or I'll yell skeever okay okay no need to make rash decisions here's half my only demand

02:53:34.300 --> 02:53:41.100
is that these are permanent so he is literally handing us the poison that we're gonna poison

02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:51.580
the bat of mead with it's it's it's so evil I love it please eat get that nutrition you

02:53:52.460 --> 02:54:01.580
I just get so distracted when I stream like I don't oh fucking hell um I just uh oh sorry sorry

02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:09.100
um it's all about pear shaped hasn't it uh yeah I just like kind of forget to eat and stuff when I

02:54:09.100 --> 02:54:14.220
stream I just get so distracted because it's like such a good time I've always been like oh my gosh

02:54:14.220 --> 02:54:27.500
oh all right oh this is things beating me up I'm literally like I'm on the red oh you can't even

02:54:27.500 --> 02:54:33.980
see my health bar oh wow my health bar is really bad right now uh I'll show you how bad it is I can

02:54:33.980 --> 02:54:40.780
I can heal right now that's how bad it oh maybe I need to adjust my chat so it doesn't go over the

02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:47.740
screen especially for video games like this I might get that change

02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:56.460
uh speaking the honeybrew mead with emmy needs honestly emmy needs delightfully

02:54:57.340 --> 02:55:03.100
emmy would cry for him it's not bad you're no hit legendary um

02:55:07.420 --> 02:55:09.660
hold on Lydia you Lydia

02:55:11.900 --> 02:55:18.060
Lydia you literally went around the way what do you mean by over the screen so you see how like

02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:24.620
next to me is that little cuttlefish to my to your left I guess from your paw see how the chat is

02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:30.060
like going up on screen from that chat box I might change it so it doesn't so the video game isn't

02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:35.420
like encroached in any way because I just noticed now that you can't see my health bar

02:55:36.140 --> 02:55:43.580
um you can see my stamina constantly but my big hairs oh oh sorry there's traps sorry sorry oh

02:55:43.580 --> 02:55:49.660
sorry sorry oh oh Lydia Lydia there's traps like did you not just hear me jump over them Lydia

02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:58.860
oh right this fight always scares me because this guy is actually super OP for no reason

02:55:58.860 --> 02:56:05.020
there's a man in here oh we need to we need to get him first because I have like no magic oh

02:56:05.020 --> 02:56:13.820
bruv bruv hold on all right I'll get the rats first he is like so strong for no reason and

02:56:13.820 --> 02:56:18.780
he freaking does that where he fucking backs off I hate when you back off when you're fighting them

02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:24.140
like I know that's normal to back off when someone's like coming at you but like it's so annoying just

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:29.100
stand still and let me parachute it's like not that big a deal yeah so that man was currently

02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:37.180
living with the the skevers um you know as long as he's happy and thriving that's the main thing but

02:56:40.940 --> 02:56:45.340
no a little to the right no no a little to the left a bit more

02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:48.140
no a little bit more to the left

02:56:51.580 --> 02:56:54.620
he's a mage yeah we hate mages honestly there's so annoying

02:56:58.060 --> 02:57:05.420
male version of imme oh I mean ow I keep getting wrecked by these traps like I've like forgotten them

02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:11.260
all right we'll finish this quest and then I will get some food in me because I'm probably moments

02:57:11.340 --> 02:57:17.180
from perishing uh you can just grab this key back here by the way super easy um I totally

02:57:17.180 --> 02:57:21.980
didn't know that on my first playthrough and walked all the way back uh like a dumb dumb

02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:27.820
I don't want to steal from it it's honestly kind of picking up stolen items is really annoying

02:57:27.820 --> 02:57:34.140
if the guards end up picking you up right we've done it we've done the quest once we finish we'll

02:57:34.140 --> 02:57:40.620
take a look if you need to sample some of the finest meat in skyline that your shift hasn't even

02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:48.220
started yet when I'm hello well it's about time I you'll just have to wait until after the camp

02:57:48.220 --> 02:57:53.500
right we're gonna watch it all we're gonna watch it all in furl lydia go take a seat there

02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:58.300

02:58:09.420 --> 02:58:14.140
I said go sit how about I get a taste of you're ruining the view lydia even though you look just

02:58:14.140 --> 02:58:21.180
like me it's my finest room yet I call it the hate game from 2011 are you planning on playing

02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:27.740
the elton ring dlc yeah we you word when it comes out we're replaying the full game again

02:58:27.740 --> 02:58:34.540
and the dlc on top I have no idea how big the dlc is it's probably gonna be a week of elton ring

02:58:34.540 --> 02:58:40.220
so I do apologize to anyone who hates elton ring I will probably have like a shorter stream and

02:58:40.220 --> 02:58:48.540
maybe do like a membership stream as well and switch it up maybe she doesn't like to be told

02:58:48.620 --> 02:58:51.500
sit she's not a good girl bad girl

02:58:58.460 --> 02:59:09.180
actually well I'm here can we maybe just turn the music down a tiny bit yeah it's a bit overwhelming

02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:16.300
like in fates and stuff this is not what it seems butt bouncing are we actually doing butt bouncing

02:59:16.300 --> 02:59:22.460
I don't know have you done it I feel like I want to like race to get us to do the dlc I don't

02:59:22.460 --> 02:59:28.460
I assume you get the dlc once you've finished the game slamming away through the lines in between

02:59:30.140 --> 02:59:38.620
we'll see how quickly your memory clears in the city's presence now move look I assure you this is

02:59:38.620 --> 02:59:44.940

03:00:06.540 --> 03:00:08.380

03:03:02.940 --> 03:03:10.940

03:03:36.380 --> 03:03:39.420
gullum eye not to be confused with golem a

03:03:40.700 --> 03:03:44.780
don't get me wrong you could scam a beggar how about I recite the work even more

03:03:46.540 --> 03:03:51.980
I reduce the work even more and chew it for me do you know that's how um used to food

03:03:51.980 --> 03:03:57.340
babies back in the day um it's actually really common for the moms to chew the food and then

03:03:57.420 --> 03:03:59.340
give it to the um

03:04:02.700 --> 03:04:09.580
um yeah so like before baby formula was a thing and like solid food training or whatever like

03:04:09.580 --> 03:04:15.020
before the kind of capitalism market kind of exploded went until you hear about what nesli did um

03:04:16.700 --> 03:04:20.780
yeah it was like really common your mom chews the food for you and then gives it to you in your

03:04:20.780 --> 03:04:24.780
mouth it's like a little baby birth moment and everyone's like that's so gross and I was like

03:04:24.780 --> 03:04:30.220
bro that's the way it is that's just like how have it be you know it's very interesting I actually

03:04:30.220 --> 03:04:34.620
could probably write an entire video I see about it and then present that video I say live on stream

03:04:34.620 --> 03:04:39.260
and just to show everyone how natural things are but everything's been so like oh they're so weird

03:04:39.260 --> 03:04:43.500
but it's only weird because we've not been exposed to it and we no longer even talk about it because

03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:48.140
it's like literally unironically been bred out of us over a few generations because capitalism is away

03:04:49.100 --> 03:04:55.340
um what one fun world scrawny did you consider getting mana as backup food

03:04:57.580 --> 03:05:06.140
yeah mummy burden literally I didn't know that was a thing it is so um uh babies newborns should

03:05:06.140 --> 03:05:11.660
start on breast milk because it's full of colostrum um and it's also because a baby doesn't actually

03:05:11.660 --> 03:05:16.620
have an immune system until six months old um so it's very important to have breast milk however

03:05:16.940 --> 03:05:22.540
it was very common to have what's called a wet nurse which is when um a woman who had recently

03:05:22.540 --> 03:05:27.660
had a child would share and because it's very common for some women to experience a surplus and

03:05:27.660 --> 03:05:34.620
it's very common for some women to experience problems producing milk it's just kind of random

03:05:34.620 --> 03:05:39.100
doesn't really there's a lot of factors that come into play um obviously stress is a major one

03:05:39.100 --> 03:05:45.660
stress on any human body for a long period do you mind I'm telling you a story about titty milk

03:05:46.860 --> 03:05:52.700
leave me alone um but yes I'm sure as a lot of you can imagine being stressed for a very long

03:05:52.700 --> 03:06:01.020
time is very bad for your health um guys uh guys uh stress manifests in a lot of mental health issues

03:06:01.020 --> 03:06:12.220
and a lot of loneliness um oh are we gonna make it you know what we're gonna send it send it right

03:06:12.220 --> 03:06:16.540
hold on hold on let them fake them out a little fake them out fake them out fake them out it's fine

03:06:17.820 --> 03:06:25.580
wow wait wrong one oh shit I'm out of stamina and he's like right next to me this is rather

03:06:25.580 --> 03:06:31.740
embarrassing I have to admit uh I didn't really think this far through yeah stress got me pretty good

03:06:31.740 --> 03:06:37.820
yeah I like it here because I learned so much information okay there we go we can get away

03:06:38.780 --> 03:06:44.620
we're I hear it I don't see it I think that's good that I don't see it though because it means

03:06:44.620 --> 03:06:50.220
it's not near me don't call me out like that yeah it's very um interest in the way it physically

03:06:50.220 --> 03:06:54.700
manifests in the way like obviously I think the majority of us have been like raised in a western

03:06:54.700 --> 03:07:00.060
society which obviously comes with a lot of socialization and socialization plays so much

03:07:00.060 --> 03:07:06.620
into the how you can deal with stress factors and like it's just kind of a sad fact that like

03:07:06.700 --> 03:07:13.020
homeboys uh kind of get told to suck it up um like I can literally go green to the girls right now

03:07:13.020 --> 03:07:18.380
and it's like nothing's wrong with it or anything um but it's very interesting how you tackle it I

03:07:18.380 --> 03:07:22.860
don't even know how you tackle it I wouldn't even have a clue where you start like the only thing I

03:07:22.860 --> 03:07:29.340
guess you could hope for is pockets of communities and overtime ideas get popular like um when the

03:07:29.340 --> 03:07:35.260
general consensus of society changes that's when the real change comes through but the problem is

03:07:35.260 --> 03:07:41.340
you have to basically go out with the old and how do you go out with the old well the old passes

03:07:41.340 --> 03:07:48.780
away the old doesn't bring down bring down the old doesn't pass on its teachings like for example um

03:07:49.660 --> 03:07:55.740
I like my grandparents talked about how they got hit by their parents and it was very common

03:07:55.740 --> 03:08:00.860
place to be hit if you didn't know it's actually illegal to punish your child via a corporal

03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:06.460
punishment yes your own child in Scotland is legal and you will be prosecuted for hitting them no it

03:08:06.460 --> 03:08:12.300
is not punishment no it is not spanking no it is literally against the law you're welcome to go up and

03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:22.540
it's very bad for the child there's a lot of things done around it um but it's very fascinating um how

03:08:22.540 --> 03:08:26.860
quickly things can change within a generation so my grandparents told me stories about them

03:08:26.860 --> 03:08:33.740
getting hit by their parents they did not hit my parents like they didn't hit mom and dad and then

03:08:33.740 --> 03:08:41.580
you know opposites I didn't hit mom and dad and mom or dad so my mom spanked me so my dad never

03:08:41.580 --> 03:08:46.140
hit me he doesn't like it he doesn't believe in it and he absolutely despises it my mom

03:08:48.380 --> 03:08:53.260
so there was this orange slipper and she used to hit me with it all the time because it's such a

03:08:53.660 --> 03:09:04.700
child um but it's very interesting because um within a couple of generations in Scotland

03:09:05.260 --> 03:09:11.260
it's a big no no to discipline your children via punishment like that physical punishment um and

03:09:11.260 --> 03:09:15.820
it's just like interesting to see as the generations come and go like some people might not like the

03:09:15.820 --> 03:09:21.500
emphasis like oh if you're in this age range you're gen X if you're in this you're a zoomer you're this

03:09:21.580 --> 03:09:29.260
you're that but the reason it is so purposeful and so important to have these names for generations

03:09:29.260 --> 03:09:40.140
is because there's also a lot of societal behaviors that emerge I hear Ninroop I hear it yes um and

03:09:41.180 --> 03:09:48.220
uh so like you who are listening to me right now odds are we were not raised in the exact same

03:09:48.220 --> 03:09:57.340
society with the expectations and whatever's however we are crazy enough to have the ability

03:09:57.340 --> 03:10:06.620
to set up a community like mind where we might agree on how things like should go and how things

03:10:06.620 --> 03:10:18.540
shouldn't go and we have created a pocket a pocket of a collective that can provide secondary

03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:25.100
socialization which is crazy because primary socialization is your parents but secondary is

03:10:25.100 --> 03:10:30.540
like outside outside influence and I could influence you to see the world differently

03:10:30.540 --> 03:10:36.940
through my words which is like insane um even we might not even be in the same generation and it's

03:10:36.940 --> 03:10:42.140
just as freaking socialization is fantastic stuff I will also probably write a massive stream essay

03:10:42.140 --> 03:10:47.340
I would love to talk about all this stuff in higher detail but right now we're about to do the thieves

03:10:47.340 --> 03:10:53.340
quest and I've forgotten again to get food but that's okay we're just gonna sneak on in

you have the most beautiful tiny hands in the world yeah some people said my hands were small um

03:25:18.620 --> 03:25:24.780
i'm not i don't actually i think that hands are the average size for a waman i thought i'm

03:25:24.780 --> 03:25:31.020
being funny i actually thought i was like bang on average for everything but i guess i'm not and

03:25:31.020 --> 03:25:38.460
i'm actually on the smaller side they are tiny okay like when i got the ruler oh sorry i just

03:25:38.460 --> 03:25:42.460
punched the microphone uh when i got the ruler i thought that was really fun because everyone can

03:25:42.460 --> 03:25:49.900
kind of um wasd is natural hand position yeah i definitely agree with that

03:25:55.740 --> 03:26:00.540
god you have no idea how badly i want to hold my hands i should come to our convention then

03:26:01.820 --> 03:26:06.700
i have uh i'll get a bodyguard just you know just to make sure everything's all above ground

03:26:06.700 --> 03:26:13.500
um but yeah like i can bring like all them things i don't know i feel like if someone

03:26:13.500 --> 03:26:18.860
comes to a convention to come see you like i like the idol meetings like the japanese idol

03:26:18.860 --> 03:26:22.620
meetings where they like hold your hand and you can like talk and look at each other like over

03:26:22.620 --> 03:26:27.900
the table type thing i think that's really sweet and cute but i don't know i don't know it just seems

03:26:27.900 --> 03:26:38.780
like something i don't know that's just me the asmr booth if only i wish a convention would

03:26:38.780 --> 03:26:48.220
entertain me to do that that's honestly ridiculous make sure everything's above the table honestly

03:26:50.060 --> 03:26:53.340
who would get in trouble first me or you me or are we fun

03:26:58.860 --> 03:27:05.420
let me analyze this one hey stroney is there any chance for hypnosis with helping the listener

03:27:05.420 --> 03:27:12.140
with addiction or focusing desires upon yourself from distractions um

03:27:14.700 --> 03:27:21.180
oh i'm not sure i can do stuff like that mine is always of an alternative nature for

03:27:21.980 --> 03:27:33.820
grat of the defying nature um i absolutely am not qualified or capable or doing anything that

03:27:34.300 --> 03:27:41.820
um kind of has like a i don't know what the word is but like i

03:27:44.220 --> 03:27:49.980
therapeutic yeah i would say there is any therapeutic hypnosis i can't participate in

03:27:49.980 --> 03:27:57.180
because i don't actually have the knowledge on how who goes there how to do it safely so uh

03:27:57.180 --> 03:28:03.820
safety first i will admit this is out of my league i am definitely not there and i don't

03:28:03.820 --> 03:28:09.420
think i ever will be there um 10 out of 10 i know 10 holy moly oh yeah oh did you forget when i eat

03:28:09.420 --> 03:28:14.540

03:28:44.780 --> 03:28:49.020
hi strawney just finished watching your sweet stream and i have to say those sweets are not as sweet

03:28:49.020 --> 03:28:56.460
as those sweets aren't as sweet as you hey oh okay we'll give you that one that was cute that was

03:28:56.460 --> 03:29:03.500
cute every journal joke i know though also did you know that the bumps on the f and j keys on

03:29:03.500 --> 03:29:07.500
your keyboard are there so you can correctly place your hands fingers on them without looking

03:29:07.820 --> 03:29:16.140
i thought the wasd was funny i didn't know that you have taught me knowledge everyone please

03:29:16.140 --> 03:29:20.540
finger the f key and notice the bump on the f that is for positioning reasons

03:29:22.620 --> 03:29:22.940
um

03:29:26.140 --> 03:29:31.180
in light of recent events the girls have made it clear they don't want our unfaithful

03:29:31.900 --> 03:29:39.980
uh see even with your permission if they are reciprocal to slowly and dedication i'm happy

03:29:39.980 --> 03:29:45.500

03:31:11.260 --> 03:31:15.180
in response to my comment about some plushies they're basically smug plushies of popular

03:31:15.180 --> 03:31:21.580
characters from the two whole series however they have developed a bit of a cult following

03:31:21.580 --> 03:31:25.580
due to memes and such and ended up with people making their own similar plushies like the

03:31:25.580 --> 03:31:30.700
newer someone evil newer so okay okay from makership ah yeah yes i see i see thank you

03:39:25.260 --> 03:39:33.100
maybe in a membership stream i tried suggesting another man to make you his new oshi because he

that seems fair um uh what was i saying oh yeah i literally have like 22 million gp and all i did

03:40:16.860 --> 03:40:26.860
was show up and freaking fish hi cuddles i'm currently watching the vod of today's ASMR stream

03:40:26.860 --> 03:40:33.580
since i missed it while sleeping i'm someone who has never been able to go under despite having a

03:40:34.300 --> 03:40:40.140
having a flavor for it one issue i have that i become

03:40:42.780 --> 03:40:48.300
hysterical i can't read that um uh

03:40:53.580 --> 03:40:55.820
uh-huh okay

03:40:56.780 --> 03:41:03.340
okay we have quite an effect on this replaying that's adorable i like that

03:41:04.380 --> 03:41:06.540
management quick hands above desk honestly

03:41:08.380 --> 03:41:16.060
hi i love you mommy i love you to everything the stream was incredible i'm really glad that

03:41:16.060 --> 03:41:19.660
interests you and i can't wait to see what you do next also i'm still here and she'd be streamed

03:41:19.660 --> 03:41:26.220
for you i'm devoted to you i really want to send you something but i haven't had the inspiration

03:41:26.220 --> 03:41:32.780
been really in my my emotions lately and it's really slammed my libido do i know a sad fact

03:41:32.780 --> 03:41:40.220
my alternative picture is the last time rip in the chat i've been so freaking stressed

03:41:40.220 --> 03:41:48.700
like all the time and i can't like unstress myself i think it'll calm down like once the

03:41:48.780 --> 03:41:52.700
things settle but like i'm so freaking stressed and it's such a shame

03:42:00.220 --> 03:42:06.780
but i'm sure i will get inspiration soon tm i think maybe i'll tell you what i think maybe

03:42:06.780 --> 03:42:12.860
once the monetization for everyone has been achieved i'll start to feel relaxed because like then

03:42:12.860 --> 03:42:17.020
truly is up to the girls whatever they want to do and i can just get fun shorts ordered of them

03:42:17.740 --> 03:42:23.100
but like right now i'm like oh my god there's four out of six why is the other two not come

03:42:23.100 --> 03:42:26.940
through because we applied for them all at the same time like oh no weapons if one of the girls

03:42:26.940 --> 03:42:31.980
don't get youtube monetization oh no that that's like a whole month and uh just like oh i don't

03:42:31.980 --> 03:42:36.380
oh i would be sick if i think about it we pretend we do not see

03:42:36.380 --> 03:42:48.700
but yeah the the what did i say there's a line of volunteers is extremely long thank

03:42:49.740 --> 03:42:51.580
yeah you guys want to make gentry right now

03:42:58.460 --> 03:43:03.820
i've almost finished eating and then i will slurp my honey tea and then we'll get back into the

03:43:03.820 --> 03:43:14.620
thieves guild

03:43:16.540 --> 03:43:24.460
skyrim's going good we're at um golem from the thieves guild quest we're about to be

03:43:25.260 --> 03:43:32.060
meeting the big naughty on who's trying to take down the thieves guild soon tm and um

03:43:32.940 --> 03:43:39.260
once we do the thieves guild we are going to do the dark brotherhood because i actually really

03:43:39.260 --> 03:43:44.940
enjoy it it's quite i think i think the dark brotherhood is actually relatively quick um

03:43:46.860 --> 03:43:50.540
and then we're going to do the vampires and then if we still have time we're going to do

03:43:51.420 --> 03:43:58.620
um the actual dragonborn quest line which i hate doing because it breaks the game and

03:43:58.700 --> 03:44:03.180
then if you ever like seriously want to do like a hundred percent speed run it's speed

03:44:03.180 --> 03:44:06.860
runs not speed run just a hundred percent achievements always leave it last because

03:44:06.860 --> 03:44:13.980
it breaks the game so much when you have to like say like oh we'll give white run up or we'll give

03:44:13.980 --> 03:44:20.460
this uh rifting off or we'll do this or we'll do that every day feel as how much it breaks the game

03:44:20.460 --> 03:44:32.460
but i finished my my bowl of lasagna um now i've got my my cup of tea and my cola i do i do

03:44:32.460 --> 03:44:38.300
i've got my cola no need to read this during a stream oh yeah what happens if i do it right now

03:44:39.260 --> 03:44:44.460
the ASMR stream was amazing strongy i was putting your hands during it

03:44:45.020 --> 03:44:47.020
ah that's so cute

03:44:54.780 --> 03:44:59.500
oh whoa someone is giving me a step by step

03:45:01.260 --> 03:45:05.500
gate on how to do haptic feedback

03:45:05.500 --> 03:45:16.060
penalize penalizing okay that's the law links um how down bad do you think is too down bad for

03:45:16.060 --> 03:45:26.220
you for me oh no i like i like main corruption so there's not really a down too bad i think

03:45:26.220 --> 03:45:32.860
corruption's really um up there um oh my first membership stream can be about that

03:45:33.100 --> 03:45:35.980
uh no about ranking everything

03:45:41.980 --> 03:45:43.740
penalize yes

03:45:45.580 --> 03:45:52.540
aw strongy i just want to thank you for giving all the girls a home and a family

03:45:52.540 --> 03:45:57.020
veal are such a positive part of the environment already and i'm happy to watch along with all

03:45:57.100 --> 03:46:02.940
the other reeflings oh reeflin i said also the latest patreon post is incredible

03:46:03.820 --> 03:46:09.100
did you like it i thought it was good would you let me pick on your party

03:46:11.580 --> 03:46:17.580
uh yes if you are a patreon member um another audio has gone up so there's a total of three

03:46:17.580 --> 03:46:24.780
audios up um it is spaced out for the other girls so because all the audios were uploaded on the first

03:46:24.780 --> 03:46:30.220
that did mean there's a bit of a break between the next one that comes up but as it stands everyone

03:46:30.220 --> 03:46:44.540
has a day if i can remember correctly azura monday mersey tuesday um emmy wednesday sheby thursday

03:46:44.540 --> 03:46:58.140
i see friday strongy saturday i'm not quite sure but just so you understand they are purposefully

03:46:58.140 --> 03:47:10.780
spaced out who goes there um and um they will be like every tuesday all of x's will go out on

03:47:10.780 --> 03:47:15.660
every tuesday all of like for me every saturday an audio will come out like that kind of thing

03:47:15.660 --> 03:47:23.180
um we i'm going to get the girls to post on what's inside like with the tags and everything

03:47:23.820 --> 03:47:31.020
i just need catch up time um she says as she's sitting on skyrim for an endurance stream

03:47:31.020 --> 03:47:36.140
i've got nothing but the cheek i really do i've got nothing but the cheek but i do need catch up

03:47:36.140 --> 03:47:44.700
time to get into the flow of things then next month um 100 will be like you will see what's

03:47:44.700 --> 03:47:50.620
inside if you want to subscribe for that month or not and if not then you know you can take a look

03:47:50.620 --> 03:47:56.060
at whoever else is posting maybe they've got something a bit more up to your style again i would

03:47:56.060 --> 03:48:03.420
like to repeat when it comes to the audios i have not shoehorned anyone into the same type of plot

03:48:03.500 --> 03:48:09.260
if you will because that will not financially enable them to be the content creator they'd

03:48:09.260 --> 03:48:14.380
like to be um a lot of the girls are looking at moving out possibly if they're able to receive

03:48:14.380 --> 03:48:19.500
enough support so that's why i do say if you only have enough money to support one girl please do

03:48:19.500 --> 03:48:28.860
pick a daughter of mine because um they are gunning to move out um and it means they would

03:48:28.860 --> 03:48:39.900
provide more content and yeah it's just a very positive cycle occurs um yes uh yeah i'm both

03:48:39.900 --> 03:48:46.220
meanies like not bad to kill it by emoji if you subscribe to everyone you get an audio every day

03:48:46.220 --> 03:48:51.740
i mean technically you're very close you get a rest day no one uploads on a sunday

03:48:52.140 --> 03:48:59.180
also they deserve it yes the girls work incredibly hard um ac was like am i allowed

03:48:59.180 --> 03:49:04.140
someone asked a question to ac on marshmallow like uh how do your recordings work and she was

03:49:04.140 --> 03:49:09.100
like am i allowed to talk about this and i'm like yeah you can as long as you don't see anything

03:49:09.100 --> 03:49:15.100
that's like nda obvious then yeah you can talk about how i i burst into your dms and hand you a

03:49:15.100 --> 03:49:20.140
script and all the spelling is wrong and the grammar's whack yeah you can talk about that all

03:49:20.140 --> 03:49:32.460
you like i say actual day of rest honestly um but yes thank you for thanking me for giving the girls

03:49:32.460 --> 03:49:38.860
a home but please understand the girls did it themselves they reached out to vealer they applied

03:49:38.860 --> 03:49:43.980
um they went to an interview and they were happy with everything some of them did the very thorough

03:49:43.980 --> 03:49:51.180
research uh emi actually was the most inquisitive and had the most questions azura i think she was

03:49:51.180 --> 03:49:56.220
just like is any of this real i think she thought she was dreaming because she never asked a single

03:49:56.220 --> 03:50:04.220
question after the interview um yeah azura was absolutely adorable emi asked a ton of questions

03:50:04.220 --> 03:50:08.780
which made me think she wasn't actually gonna accept the character because i told her what the

03:50:08.780 --> 03:50:16.540
character theme was and i saw people were being weird but yeah azura was like fuck it we ball

03:50:16.540 --> 03:50:23.500
indian and docs and notwithstanding they have carte blanche what carte blanche

03:50:24.300 --> 03:50:33.820
but what uh in english what in english english that's so azura honestly yeah that sounds like

03:50:34.780 --> 03:50:44.380
big mommy we ball honestly a free pass or it means like free reign oh carte blanche a blank

03:50:44.940 --> 03:50:52.700
menu is what the translation is that makes sense a free pass a blank menu oh my god i can't believe

03:50:52.700 --> 03:51:02.300
it sorry i translated it literally versus uh metaphor good uh hi sending messages scares me

03:51:02.380 --> 03:51:06.060
but i want i watched your ASMR stream and it was amazing i can't wait to see more of your

03:51:06.060 --> 03:51:11.900
stuff both ASMR and other videos they are so fantastic i'm watching you do what you love and

03:51:11.900 --> 03:51:17.900
making ASMR making via lure has me thinking i should start and follow my own you should follow

03:51:17.900 --> 03:51:22.540
your own dreams you've only got one shot i keep snail blinking please paul please don't notice me

03:51:22.540 --> 03:51:27.020
snail blinking you do you've only got one shot if you've got a dream or something you want to achieve

03:51:27.660 --> 03:51:32.300
where can go for it like if i win the lottery already know what i'm doing all i'm saying is if

03:51:32.300 --> 03:51:40.220
i win the lottery the girls are getting stacked out so i'm saying um you know the split going even

03:51:40.220 --> 03:51:46.460
higher you know oh it's always fun to try and reach for a new goal like for example hypnosis

03:51:46.460 --> 03:51:50.780
is my new goal i've always enjoyed it and always liked it but i've never made it myself because

03:51:50.780 --> 03:51:55.180
like i'm just like not skilled and i need to make sure it's safe and all that sorry i'm trying

03:51:55.180 --> 03:52:01.180
there's a fucking cat hair on my face and it's one of those cat hairs where you wipe it away and

03:52:01.180 --> 03:52:05.740
then it does a 360 look back on wherever it's freaking a caption i'm so sorry

03:52:08.620 --> 03:52:15.900
that'll be gimley honestly um but you honestly you placed everyone in their spots so well i

03:52:15.900 --> 03:52:21.660
wouldn't picture anyone else yes there is right no i'm not gonna say it because i might start up

03:52:21.660 --> 03:52:28.380
some shitters um and we ain't stirring the pot from these parts we tap the sign from these parts um

03:52:29.260 --> 03:52:39.340
let's see hi strony could you give us a hearing test like hearing test asmr of course i can do

03:52:39.340 --> 03:52:49.340
something like that for ya you do a 360 and walk away wait a minute a 180 oops wait no 360 is the

03:52:49.340 --> 03:52:56.460
circle 180 is the opposite right okay um i could absolutely do a hearing test i did a

03:52:56.460 --> 03:53:02.940
ear cleaning where i'm like muffled until as the audio progresses i'm less muffled

03:53:02.940 --> 03:53:06.540
i thought it was pretty cool i need to edit it actually it might be one of my one and four

03:53:06.540 --> 03:53:12.860
because i i owe you four this whole skyrim stream actually kind of went perfect because tomorrow i will

03:53:13.420 --> 03:53:19.500
do my monetization celebration stream where everyone can absolutely laugh and i'm pretty sure

03:53:19.500 --> 03:53:24.060
someone's probably already guessed what i've got planned for it there's no way after yesterday's

03:53:24.060 --> 03:53:28.700
stream someone hasn't put two and two together and knows why i got a pedicure in particular

03:53:29.580 --> 03:53:36.940
i refuse i refuse she fell for the oldest these xbox joke honestly do a 540 believe it

03:53:37.900 --> 03:53:44.060
um my body prevented me from my dream so i come about have you ever had an actual medical

03:53:44.060 --> 03:53:51.180
ear cleaning i've not had a medical ear cleaning but i did get my hearing checked as a child um

03:53:51.180 --> 03:53:57.740
because i was ignoring my mum where i was undiagnosed it was my idea actually um

03:54:00.380 --> 03:54:02.780
i'm going to sip my tea before it gets too cold okay

03:54:03.740 --> 03:54:12.140
eh yeah my mum got me uh sent to a hearing test because she was sitting at my dad she was like

03:54:12.140 --> 03:54:17.580
strony doesn't he listen to me like strony strony never hears me and i used to do this thing

03:54:17.580 --> 03:54:23.740
where i sat right in front of the tv so the tv was on a stand but i would sit directly under it so

03:54:23.740 --> 03:54:28.780
my neck was looking directly upward sorry i just hit the mic there by uh i know you can't see my

03:54:28.780 --> 03:54:35.100
hands but my mic was at my mic my neck was directly upwards looking at the tv like pure pure

03:54:35.100 --> 03:54:41.740
in a trance like straight up like tizm a doctor walked in and tizm was the diagnosis type thing

03:54:42.380 --> 03:54:48.380
and obviously my mum didn't know what it was all about at the time so i got sent for a hearing test

03:54:48.380 --> 03:54:54.700
and she was like the wife that did the hearing test on me she was like oh no pet you're hearing

03:54:54.700 --> 03:55:01.660
spain i don't know what's going on with you um and yeah basically that was that's when the

03:55:01.660 --> 03:55:08.220
signs start to show and then now here i am someone who has to read and write for a living and goodness

03:55:08.220 --> 03:55:15.580
gravey is it freaking hard i'm slurping is she okay nah she's just fucking hella autistic

03:55:15.580 --> 03:55:25.820
a kid with autism how close were you to the tv oh i'm not being funny when i'm like i was directly

03:55:25.820 --> 03:55:34.140
below the tv i like i was sitting crisscross looking directly up at the tv and my neck was

03:55:34.140 --> 03:55:44.060
up in the air like it and i and my mum ascertained that it was hearing issues rather than something

03:55:44.060 --> 03:55:50.300
else maybe going on she had a case of strontism honestly the strontism's too strong

03:55:53.420 --> 03:55:58.700
um that's not good for your eyes oh well i do actually need to be wearing my glicks but

03:56:00.460 --> 03:56:06.060
i'm making it work okay i was right in the vtuber collab scripts and i was like this is too small

03:56:06.060 --> 03:56:11.260
this text so i zoomed in and i'm like oh my god i'm gonna be a blind as a fish like really soon

03:56:11.260 --> 03:56:13.900
wait that's literally me as a kid literally

03:56:18.700 --> 03:56:26.540
do you reckon cuttlefish have actual autism um as an uncertified marine biologist anything is

03:56:26.540 --> 03:56:31.820
possible if you didn't know down syndrome is possible in animals as well um i believe down

03:56:31.820 --> 03:56:40.940
syndrome is the deletion of chrome zone oh god what is it in humans uh not 32 that's

03:56:41.740 --> 03:56:45.260
not right i can't remember which deletion it is but it can happen in gorillas

03:56:45.260 --> 03:56:49.740
seriously i'm not even kidding look up down some down syndrome gorilla and like it's

03:56:49.740 --> 03:56:56.060
fucking creepy oh it's an extra edition of 21 sorry yeah i'm thinking of the deletion one

03:56:56.060 --> 03:57:01.340
what is the deletion one called that i always watch documentaries about

03:57:03.180 --> 03:57:08.860
it happens when life deletes 32 yes um actually spindle fiber failure um

03:57:11.180 --> 03:57:17.180
uh which is i um i find it really interesting oh god i feel like every time i'm like i find

03:57:17.180 --> 03:57:22.380
this so interesting and fascinating it leads to me rambling about something that you guys couldn't

03:57:22.380 --> 03:57:28.300
give less of a shit about i feel really bad but at the same time i really like blabbing away so i'm

03:57:28.300 --> 03:57:35.820
like that just do it that just tell you about um fertilization so the reason why the rate of down

03:57:35.820 --> 03:57:43.500
syndrome goes up dramatically the older the woman is beyond the age of 25 yes the age of 25 um

03:57:44.220 --> 03:57:50.940
you're you're already hitting the wall at 25 rip um the reason it goes up exponentially is because

03:57:51.020 --> 03:57:59.660
the failure of the spindle fibers that's what pulls apart um that's what pulls it apart and then

03:57:59.660 --> 03:58:06.060
results in a the an additional chromosome wiggling about which is the rise of down syndrome which is

03:58:06.060 --> 03:58:15.180
why women who um are having children later in life are often advised to do what is uh referred to

03:58:16.140 --> 03:58:22.940
as a DNA test which i've completely forgotten the name of but basically they pierce the amniotic

03:58:22.940 --> 03:58:29.100
sac and take a tiny cell sample of the baby and then check its DNA sequence under um you know get

03:58:29.100 --> 03:58:33.020
it because to see if the child has down syndrome or not and then either they're advised would you

03:58:33.020 --> 03:58:38.780
like to terminate or not or bring to term whatever type thing goes on but um it definitely is a risk

03:58:38.780 --> 03:58:44.700
and uh like also being obese with the child as well results in gestational diabetes which is

03:58:44.700 --> 03:58:54.540
very dangerous for the child very dangerous for the mum um there's also um if depending on the blood

03:58:54.540 --> 03:59:00.780
type of the mother and the blood type of the child the mother during the entire pregnancy her body can

03:59:00.780 --> 03:59:07.740
be attacking the baby until it um has a natural um abortion if you didn't know abortion is the

03:59:07.740 --> 03:59:14.620
natural term but you can also get a medical abortion but abortion is the natural term for

03:59:14.620 --> 03:59:19.820
it just happening and there are many reasons why it can never come to term how do you know all this

03:59:19.820 --> 03:59:26.780
stuff is fascinating no i don't go to school i like watching youtube videos about um biology related

03:59:26.780 --> 03:59:34.060
things i have a fascination in uh diagnoses in particular like why the reason it occurs for

03:59:34.060 --> 03:59:42.780
example um like uh there's this syndrome uh of course it evades my mind i think it's called

03:59:42.780 --> 03:59:49.660
like william hunter syndrome where the child or the well the child that can become an adult um

03:59:49.660 --> 03:59:54.860
because you you do not pass away uh unless you have complications with other diseases for example

03:59:54.860 --> 04:00:01.500
um you will never experience the sensation of being full uh you will constantly eat um there's

04:00:01.500 --> 04:00:08.700
like hereditary syndromes as well like hunter syndrome which is pretty uh devastating um there's

04:00:08.700 --> 04:00:15.660
interesting one such as dwarfism dwarfism can actually be passed on by two individuals who

04:00:15.660 --> 04:00:26.140
visually do not have any um display of any dwarf uh ism genetics um but it is a recessive gene uh

04:00:26.140 --> 04:00:30.380
and if the two people come together um yep you can have it how do you know all this

04:00:30.380 --> 04:00:36.540
reefling that obviously has not got the autism angel man syndrome is that angel man syndrome

04:00:37.660 --> 04:00:46.620
is that the one where the child is locked in the child like say i believe so mentally they

04:00:46.620 --> 04:00:55.740
can't develop any further um uh yes uh Harley Quinn syndrome um doesn't sound like what it is

04:00:55.820 --> 04:01:01.260
it's where your skin constantly your skin regenerates so fast that you flake and you break and it's

04:01:01.260 --> 04:01:08.140
just absolute it is a living heck for those poor uh like children that are born but you can make it

04:01:08.140 --> 04:01:16.060
to adulthood um there's a lot of sad um diagnoses that you can get like you can get childhood

04:01:16.060 --> 04:01:22.380
dementia those are quite crushing ones um stroneys institute for the gift to take

04:01:22.860 --> 04:01:27.100
you up angel man is the eaten one is it Harley Quinn issues yeah

04:01:28.940 --> 04:01:35.900
as door is dwarfism classified only is being short there are a redonkulous amount of dwarfism

04:01:35.900 --> 04:01:43.420
classifications um some can be like no stunted growth on the abdomen uh other versions are no

04:01:43.420 --> 04:01:51.660
stunted growth on the arms and the legs but the um organ holder area if you will for lack of better

04:01:51.660 --> 04:01:56.860
words abdomen all that and chest and that like there's so many different classifications is quite um

04:01:59.100 --> 04:02:03.580
it's quite fascinating stuff when she uh get into torso yeah torso will do just nicely

04:02:03.580 --> 04:02:08.220
i remember when the photos of those babies were used as shock foot yeah unfortunately um

04:02:10.220 --> 04:02:16.940
kind of if you use older like if you look up like Freud stuff for example you get quite a

04:02:16.940 --> 04:02:22.220
few older photos that are like Freud Freud you didn't have to photograph that mate like you know

04:02:23.260 --> 04:02:28.940
do you know about prisons yeah like the stanley prison experiment and how people play roles that

04:02:28.940 --> 04:02:35.500
they perceive to be superior uh absolutely fascinating stuff i do and enjoy the psychology

04:02:35.500 --> 04:02:45.740
it has to offer um i think humans and our everyday socialization were always kind of

04:02:46.300 --> 04:02:53.500
it's always insinuated that there's someone to look up to but i am a big believer in the three

04:02:54.540 --> 04:03:01.660
um three perspective talk and it's like parent to parent child to child adult to parent or

04:03:01.660 --> 04:03:07.740
something like that and it's like the three ways you can communicate with someone he said prions

04:03:07.740 --> 04:03:16.380
oh not prisons my apology i was talking about the the stanley prison experiment prions uh no a

04:03:16.380 --> 04:03:21.820
little bit about prions not not not too much sorry i just read what i wanted to read prudder's

04:03:21.820 --> 04:03:26.860
williams syndrome oh prudder willie syndrome that sounds like um i'll just mix them up yes

04:03:26.860 --> 04:03:33.420
prions diseases are horrifying um did you know about the family of blue people from generations of

04:03:34.940 --> 04:03:40.700
i know there's a family that's like on youtube because someone goes and films them

04:03:40.700 --> 04:03:47.340
and they communicate via barks because they have so many issues it's such a shame

04:03:48.300 --> 04:03:54.540
i want this woman to yank me for the rest of my life honestly

04:03:56.620 --> 04:04:03.180
uh well that speaking of prions um what is it rabid rickin bites you what's that called

04:04:04.380 --> 04:04:13.660
as soon as you develop um water phobia water phobia hydrophobic water phobia once you develop

04:04:13.660 --> 04:04:20.780
hydrophobia rabies that's it once you develop hydrophobia you have a hundred percent um loss rate

04:04:21.500 --> 04:04:28.460
you can't win it is it is some scary stuff and and to think that we are very lucky to avoid this

04:04:28.460 --> 04:04:34.300
by getting a simple tetanus shot um it turns out in test was not Winston are you squiddling

04:04:34.300 --> 04:04:40.860
me right now i'm not i'm sorry for the interruption no no on side note strani teacher outfit when

04:04:41.820 --> 04:04:50.140

04:06:03.420 --> 04:06:08.860
accidentally wrote emise part one uh to our four part series which is a big mistake because having

04:06:08.860 --> 04:06:13.100
too many cooks spoils the broth especially when it comes to bloody scripts i can assure you that much

04:06:13.100 --> 04:06:25.740
uh um what uh mercedes is overall like a you finally accept being with the yandere and some

04:06:25.740 --> 04:06:33.820
people don't like that there's resistance i comprehend but in this one i want her to be

04:06:33.820 --> 04:06:41.420
resistant and then she breaks you okay that's what i want okay and what i want go i can't remember

04:06:41.420 --> 04:06:48.140
what aces is i remember aces but damn strongly are you the tower of babel because you are stacked

04:06:48.140 --> 04:06:54.860
in defiance of god and i cannot speak coherently when you go down oh thank you for the tip and

04:06:55.500 --> 04:06:56.540
oh my god

04:06:59.660 --> 04:07:02.460
babel babel babel babel

04:07:03.980 --> 04:07:10.540
wow brian i can't believe you even said that out loud honestly um are they gonna be on patreon

04:07:10.540 --> 04:07:16.300
they are gonna be on patreon please do uh don't however wait until the don't if you're like i do

04:07:16.300 --> 04:07:23.900
not have the money to support these girls do not worry you can do it for free by liking their streams

04:07:23.900 --> 04:07:29.020
and hanging out even if you're lurking it's perfectly fine um and then you might be seeing

04:07:29.020 --> 04:07:33.820
yourself but if i don't give money i don't get access to certain content while this is true

04:07:33.820 --> 04:07:41.980
wait until the don't know thorns i have purposely made the effort for goals to be public access um

04:07:42.700 --> 04:07:50.140
now please don't get me wrong there still be rewards for those who can but i have purposely

04:07:50.780 --> 04:07:57.820
pushed for public access rewards once goals have been met please let me try and cook it's very hard

04:07:57.820 --> 04:08:07.820
to find a good balance who goes there i don't find myself um but yes i am i am trying my best to find

04:08:07.820 --> 04:08:13.260
the perfect thing we've already undercut the market severely price point wise on patreon

04:08:13.900 --> 04:08:23.020
um and we hope that through showing the lack of greed the lack of greed uh that you know

04:08:24.060 --> 04:08:29.740
don't worry like even if you can't pay we're we've got you okay we've got you uh we'll hook you up

about a man's hubris and defiance of god and the reason they allegedly that man speak

04:09:12.780 --> 04:09:20.620
isn't that tower of babel on or am i getting my bees mixed up my babel and the tower of babel

babalon access stability no greed and moments company i gotta go on a jog and enjoy your jog

04:12:00.220 --> 04:12:07.660
wasn't open up oh azura gets you to clean out her star right you're done i'm not not you're done

04:12:08.780 --> 04:12:13.580
didn't even get to the the first message i read in chat after like a couple of minutes of combat

04:12:13.580 --> 04:12:22.940
that's terrible yeah azura's star is i uh thought it was on i'm literally speedrun the plot i've

04:12:22.940 --> 04:12:30.140
gone like 10 leagues ahead i do apologize babel is where humanity teamed up to build a tower

04:12:31.260 --> 04:12:34.460
to heaven and knocked it down and

04:12:35.420 --> 04:12:41.100
um honestly it's quite interesting how

04:12:43.340 --> 04:12:48.460
no i can't say that unfortunately um base i'm speedrunning the plot

04:12:52.540 --> 04:12:57.020
yeah i've been playing too much binding of isaac oh my god wait have i said i'm

04:12:57.020 --> 04:13:01.500
i'm like nine eight percent sure i've actually already said this but some of the girls are into

04:13:01.980 --> 04:13:09.420
tarot cards they're called um and it's the funniest thing ever and the reason why it's

04:13:09.420 --> 04:13:15.900
funny is my only exposure to tarot cards is the binding of isaac okay which means whenever they're

04:13:15.900 --> 04:13:21.180
talking about like pool and cards or whatever they're like the tower card and i'm like yes

04:13:21.180 --> 04:13:27.260
yes six bombs six bombs you can probably unlock like a secret um like a tinted rock and get like

04:13:27.260 --> 04:13:32.540
a soul heart from it yes and like the lovers yes you can get two hearts if you can find a donation

04:13:32.540 --> 04:13:38.060
machine maybe you can get some coins out of it i'm like oh goodness sake like all of them must be

04:13:38.060 --> 04:13:45.180
rolling their eyes that my only experience like the freaking the hanged man uh oh yeah um that's

04:13:45.180 --> 04:13:52.300
fantastic i can uh i can fly in the room like position or the full card oh yeah it takes me

04:13:52.300 --> 04:13:57.660
back to the starting of the the map oh that's amazing that's amazing uh hey i'm just gonna

04:13:57.660 --> 04:14:04.380
skip this part because i don't really need to see it um can you speak a little bit about your

04:14:04.380 --> 04:14:09.260
plans for membership no bother you shoot before but you're honestly worth it oh my god stop you're

04:14:09.260 --> 04:14:17.740
gonna make me blush um i will most likely do two memberships uh streams a week um most likely a

04:14:17.740 --> 04:14:23.340
Samar membership is probably the most requested i also like doing watch alongs um some stream

04:14:23.340 --> 04:14:33.180
snipe games uh maybe for more close things um maybe i did maybe i i don't care what you promise

04:14:33.180 --> 04:14:40.620
if i tell you the buyer's name hasn't learned you kill me well i have a body okay it looks like

04:14:40.620 --> 04:14:47.820
only bribery works on him um two i mean yeah i want to make it worth your money like the way

04:14:47.820 --> 04:14:55.820
i try to think of it in my head is how much do you pay for like a movie ticket for like one and a

04:14:55.820 --> 04:15:02.460
half hours entertainment okay i'ma take that and then double it and then double it again so i'm like

04:15:02.460 --> 04:15:09.420
okay i'll try to stream every single day i'll also try to offer membership streams at least twice a

04:15:09.420 --> 04:15:14.620
week that seems fair that means in total for the membership not only do you directly support me and

04:15:14.620 --> 04:15:21.020
future projects gentle and the projects the girls want to pursue soon but we can't talk about any of

04:15:21.020 --> 04:15:31.660
it yet um and it means like also get like a more i suppose like a more intimate stream experience of

04:15:31.660 --> 04:15:41.420
people like that um like seventeen dollars for a movie ticket that's outrageous um gen two confirmed

04:15:41.420 --> 04:15:46.780
live on the stream stocks i remember the first time i did this quest i was so nervous about like

04:15:46.780 --> 04:15:54.540
all the guards coming at me but they don't even care hanged man to we we hingees well you do

04:15:54.540 --> 04:15:59.260
watch together streams for members i absolutely would love to do that yes we can a hundred percent

04:15:59.340 --> 04:16:05.900
do that gen two spoiled live no clickbait oh you just wait until the zers don't a thumb for that

04:16:08.460 --> 04:16:12.860
if you want to see one of the concepts but not all

04:16:15.660 --> 04:16:20.700
i don't really talk about it in the server with the girls out of respect because of uh

04:16:21.500 --> 04:16:26.700
a miscommunication on my part and honestly it's kind of easier it's much easier to go

04:16:27.500 --> 04:16:31.900
you know oh shit my bad you're right then to like explain in mass detail like what the

04:16:31.900 --> 04:16:35.420
most communication was you know like it is what it is

04:16:37.580 --> 04:16:39.900
gen two is just she be with a different voice and a real color

04:16:41.660 --> 04:16:48.860
i'm actually getting her take this a chocolate skin at some point i'm probably doing it within

04:16:48.860 --> 04:16:53.900
the next one i brought in the coin and what not at all we're just skipping through the dialogue

04:16:53.980 --> 04:17:01.340
that can't be our skin into this look now since our transaction is done i love the gen two memes

04:17:01.340 --> 04:17:09.740
but gen one 3d though um the girls are all very interested in 3d the problem is i don't know

04:17:09.740 --> 04:17:19.980
i think i'm saying about it i don't have a heart no

04:17:24.540 --> 04:17:30.380
you should think about staying the night uh wait i know one of those songs but she doesn't sing it

04:17:30.380 --> 04:17:36.540
it's rodrick rodrick there's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit sure what can i do for you

04:17:36.940 --> 04:17:41.260
um no there once was a hero named ragnar the rest

04:17:41.820 --> 04:17:46.460
who came riding to white run from old rodrick stand

04:17:47.820 --> 04:17:58.460
all this ragged and ragged and brandish his blade as he told the old stories and gold that he made

04:17:58.540 --> 04:18:04.380
i can't remember the rest i need the rest of it

04:18:06.140 --> 04:18:14.060
it's in another end i said another end she doesn't go here right we're just gonna if you

04:18:14.060 --> 04:18:18.620
want to skip this quest literally just time sink and he will teleport because it's just such a

04:18:19.740 --> 04:18:24.300
whatever way you go about it you know the 3d will be lit yeah i don't have a clue like

04:18:24.300 --> 04:18:30.860
they maybe had like such a gorgeous 3d model but i'm like 9 in percent sure that shitting

04:18:30.860 --> 04:18:39.020
vr chat um but i don't know what it is and i'm not sure any of the girls have 3d experience

04:18:39.020 --> 04:18:44.620
either to help me out the best i can do is like 3d vr chat but i don't know if that's

04:18:44.620 --> 04:18:55.500
disappointing for them um i will maybe ask sin sin is vr chat i asked her and i was quite happy

04:18:55.500 --> 04:19:02.140
with her model like um and i think that's like what the girls are if they're one 3d like that's all

04:19:02.140 --> 04:19:09.660
of god you know um i'll be a learning experience for all vr chat streams being created with you

04:19:09.660 --> 04:19:17.740
know could you imagine acs dg sessions in pure chat yeah it's it's not necessarily a lot of work

04:19:17.740 --> 04:19:24.380
because i just oh you can't wait in this location dumb game we're forcing you east empire company

04:19:24.380 --> 04:19:34.780
warehouse i wonder if that was by the british empire british um so this level you're supposed to

04:19:34.780 --> 04:19:49.020
like lurk from the sky but yeah i need to offer the girls um what are they called all the trackers

04:19:49.740 --> 04:19:55.260
but i myself don't actually know what trackers they need and i don't know what the full price

04:19:55.260 --> 04:19:59.900
point is like i've been really open and honest with the girls and been like obviously once

04:19:59.900 --> 04:20:04.620
everyone's monetized we can see what kind of money you're earning and if it's good it's bad

04:20:04.700 --> 04:20:09.020
like because obviously if the girls money's low they're not going to want to stick around are they

04:20:09.020 --> 04:20:18.700
um so i do have some kind of like mildly boosting efforts but it's not really

04:20:20.780 --> 04:20:27.420
yeah you know it's kind of when you're on the managing side it's kind of like i can only do

04:20:27.420 --> 04:20:32.460
so much with what the girls give me very thankfully the girls are giving me they're all like literally

04:20:32.460 --> 04:20:37.900
everyone streamed every single day which was insane uh within reason of course um and like

04:20:37.900 --> 04:20:44.620
they're taking it a bit more easy this week which i'm very glad to see we do almost i'm a sneak

04:20:44.620 --> 04:20:53.980
increase yeah or do you think he notices me at all yeah no uh there are some really nice uh things

04:20:53.980 --> 04:21:03.900
you can do in vr chat i have seen something i didn't what detected me oh oh no he's discovering all

04:21:03.900 --> 04:21:07.420
the dead bodies along the way but he doesn't find that suspicious like at all

04:21:11.020 --> 04:21:16.540
i don't know if my my poor heart can take stronti in 3d it would be so fun because you can see how

04:21:16.540 --> 04:21:23.900
like animated at um i thought about doing a dance 3d stream where like i play music

04:21:23.900 --> 04:21:28.380
that you guys suggest and like we just dance and drink and stuff i don't know is that weird

04:21:39.100 --> 04:21:45.580
just a body nothing so so literally oh well mustn't be anything um i thought that would be

04:21:45.660 --> 04:21:50.060
cute like rating your songs and stuff but i don't know how good the tracking is like because

04:21:50.060 --> 04:21:54.460
i want i want to see my butt jiggle i won't be twerking and stuff

04:21:57.180 --> 04:22:00.380
i know the year is transpiring and it's really endearing how committed you are to making sure

04:22:00.380 --> 04:22:07.820
everyone eats good both the talents and fun it's right here in my favor i just uh is he gonna just

04:22:08.460 --> 04:22:11.820
checked me i mean clearly just doesn't care

04:22:14.620 --> 04:22:23.900
if someone go oh um 3d stronti hypnotizes you that'll be interesting like i just don't

04:22:23.900 --> 04:22:30.140
know how 3d works at all i think vain or like sony notes are the default for most tracking i've seen

04:22:30.140 --> 04:22:36.060
vr avatars with pendulum and spiral tall everyone just the exception

04:22:43.100 --> 04:22:47.820
okay so he does a little uh jabate where he actually comes walking back which is why i'm

04:22:47.820 --> 04:22:56.780
hanging back right now because he's a wee liar um but yeah 3d definitely on the cards we're just

04:22:57.740 --> 04:23:04.860
obviously we're kind of in the recoup funds stage um and kind of seeing where everyone is of

04:23:04.860 --> 04:23:08.620
everyone happy like i sent the girls all the message i was like is there anything i can do to

04:23:08.620 --> 04:23:12.300
make your experience better like how do you feel after your first week and i got like a lot of

04:23:12.300 --> 04:23:21.260
good feedback so um i'm just gonna be getting ready to get the girls shorts more consistently

04:23:22.220 --> 04:23:28.940
because it's taking me a hot second to get shorts that i was hoping to at least get them

04:23:28.940 --> 04:23:34.220
like two a week out right now it's like one a week oops and that's just because i suck

04:23:36.140 --> 04:23:41.020
and i'm gonna fall in the water stronti but don't jiggle jiggle it falls

04:23:43.100 --> 04:23:48.220
my money don't jiggle jiggle it falls i like to see you wiggle wiggle for sure

04:23:48.940 --> 04:23:55.740
by the way when our membership expected to become available on tomorrow's stream um

04:23:56.380 --> 04:24:04.300
i'm gonna get it all set up um and all of that so tomorrow's stream isn't gonna be skyrim

04:24:04.300 --> 04:24:08.220
uh we're not gonna do full achievements because i don't know why my achievements aren't working

04:24:10.140 --> 04:24:12.780
uh there are enemies all over here but you can just go swinging

04:24:13.020 --> 04:24:16.940
you picked a bad time to get lost i think if

04:24:21.100 --> 04:24:27.500
this is no there is a health potion stacked over there somewhere i remember correctly

04:24:30.620 --> 04:24:37.100
oh i thought there was a health potion here i guess no it's just wine close enough

04:24:37.980 --> 04:24:42.780
we can sell these potion of strength so there's just spiders in there i don't know if there's

04:24:42.780 --> 04:24:49.020
anything else you can just go willy nilly through this it's not really um no magic i hate magic

04:24:50.460 --> 04:24:55.340
i don't want to go i can literally hear that spider in that cave it's membership gonna stream

04:24:55.340 --> 04:25:00.860
yeah it's tomorrow so the the skyrim part two is getting steam rolled over to make way for the

04:25:00.860 --> 04:25:07.100
monetization stream and then i'm like a hundred percent sure you guys know exactly what i'm doing

04:25:07.100 --> 04:25:17.100
tomorrow it's not even gonna be a surprise at this point um but just yeah this is just gonna be a

04:25:17.100 --> 04:25:22.220
one-off skyrim achievement if the achievements were working then yeah but i don't know why they're

04:25:22.220 --> 04:25:29.500
not uh so we might actually do a calming a bit earlier than expected she be as live again yes

04:25:29.500 --> 04:25:40.860
she be cotton boom any any cotton boom um oh my yeah oh he's armored up

04:25:43.260 --> 04:25:55.420
who's next archer i have no idea what she's doing i'm just stupid to figure out are you

04:25:55.580 --> 04:26:00.460
wait do you know do you guys wait just take a guess at what you think my monetization stream

04:26:00.460 --> 04:26:06.140
tomorrow is take a guess and i'll see if you guys know i'll tell you if you got it right or not

04:26:10.140 --> 04:26:13.020
right where's the guy you should be here oh there is

04:26:15.340 --> 04:26:21.420
right yeah feet yeah okay feet stream it's feet ASMR i'm gonna have the camera

04:26:22.380 --> 04:26:27.180
on my feet and because i have dexterity in my toes i'm literally gonna hold the ASMR

04:26:27.740 --> 04:26:38.300
tools with my toes and do like ASMR feet stream that's fine yeah feet yeah it's ridiculous i know

04:26:43.340 --> 04:26:47.980
yeah i know it's ridiculous but i thought it was funny as anything and because my model has like

04:26:48.060 --> 04:26:54.060
french tip toes i thought like yeah this is perfect i don't think my other toes are gonna

04:26:54.060 --> 04:27:01.180
heal in time for it though unfortunately it's pretty mangled i don't i don't think i have to go to

04:27:01.180 --> 04:27:05.420
the doctor i think i have to go to the doctor if it starts getting inflamed you needed to know more

04:27:06.380 --> 04:27:12.940
now tell you what consider me your new friend in the north i'm keeping the deed any objections

04:27:13.020 --> 04:27:17.900
consider it a carlaya didn't even want it why did carlaya purchase the golden state now that i know

04:27:17.900 --> 04:27:26.300
who she may even uh if i was maven exactly this carlaya must have spent a lot of time

04:27:28.300 --> 04:27:37.820
would be demonetized i mean can you get demonetized it's literally just fee like uh if you cannot

04:27:37.900 --> 04:27:43.900
take away the ha ha funny from it it's literally just the body part and ASMR and like me is that

04:27:43.900 --> 04:27:46.540
dog um i heard that

04:27:50.140 --> 04:27:55.500
gods could you get any more perfect last the only concept i came up for like my monetization celebration

04:27:59.740 --> 04:28:04.380
people walk on their feet all the time yeah like i just think it's more like funny ha ha than it is

04:28:04.380 --> 04:28:10.060
like anything else but like i this time so i don't keep repeating it but i generally like

04:28:10.060 --> 04:28:15.340
feel so feminine now that i've got like my little manicure pedicure like i felt so pampered like i was

04:28:15.340 --> 04:28:21.180
completely uncomfortable with the entire situation but i did feel really pampered and i was like oh

04:28:22.460 --> 04:28:28.300
this is actually kind of nice hold on a minute hold on a minute these gender norms have hands

04:28:28.300 --> 04:28:35.500
god damn it not again i've fallen for another one this is too difficult it's too difficult i can't

04:28:35.500 --> 04:28:43.500
resist i thought i could can you really not jump this oh fine you are very feminine literally like

04:28:43.500 --> 04:28:51.420
apparently my hands are super small as well like oh these gender norms have hands foot rubs though

04:28:51.980 --> 04:28:59.340
i will admit the foot rub that felt like heavenly oh my god like my like brain was like a wire and

04:28:59.340 --> 04:29:04.060
funny i was like hold on this is like super relaxing i can't believe it all the freaking

04:29:04.060 --> 04:29:10.620
stereotypes about whamming like in foot rubs are true it's awful i felt i felt so good though i was

04:29:10.620 --> 04:29:17.100
like damn i need a need a reflin right now i need a need a sacrificial a sacrificial reflin right

04:29:17.100 --> 04:29:23.100
now oh can i do that at the convention if we do a convention oh my god i'm literally going through

04:29:23.100 --> 04:29:25.820
all the sky room right now just to get to the other side of the map

04:29:27.580 --> 04:29:32.780
e strong easy girl i can't believe it i'm more impressed with how dexterity how much dexterity

04:29:32.780 --> 04:29:39.660
you have for your toes honestly my grippers on a rung you'll never guess what i'm sitting on right

04:29:40.380 --> 04:29:47.500
take a guess what did you need i volunteer literally should i just do that where you're

04:29:47.500 --> 04:29:54.220
like massage my feet at the convention uh he said oh wait no i have sweaty feet

04:29:54.940 --> 04:29:58.940
oh i can't let yous do that the reason why the women could do it is because i had to put my

04:29:58.940 --> 04:30:04.540
feet in like this little water bath so she had no clue that she was dealing with the sweaty feet

04:30:04.780 --> 04:30:11.820
so we're now learning that carlaya is this evil evil trying to take down the thieves guild so

04:30:11.820 --> 04:30:18.860
we're gonna meet and mercer free or sorry mercer free and i if you want the correct english are

04:30:18.860 --> 04:30:26.540
going to go and confront them um and it's called scoundrels foley oh no i've just completed that

04:32:16.940 --> 04:32:19.260

04:32:21.020 --> 04:32:28.940
look at that chicken butt chicken butt chicken butt what oh Lydia no way she dances with me what

04:32:38.540 --> 04:32:47.820
chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken oh look it's your egg oh you have so many eggs oh my god this

04:32:47.820 --> 04:32:55.820
is exactly what i want is this what older like chicken head covers are still like that's amazing

04:32:55.820 --> 04:33:01.340
oh my god i would absolutely love to do a stream about the domestication of animals as well think of

04:33:01.340 --> 04:33:09.820
how many endless animal species we have and there's only i think 11 domesticated species isn't that

04:33:09.820 --> 04:33:14.380
amazing although there was one russian guy who tried to domesticate foxes and he actually got

04:33:14.380 --> 04:33:20.780
really far but it does take years and years and you can hypnotize the chicken by drawing the line

04:33:20.780 --> 04:33:27.660
and dirt in front of them oh oh i was a little moan to hit there please email them thank you

04:33:29.500 --> 04:33:30.940
there's a little shack down here

04:33:35.340 --> 04:33:42.380
domesticated foxes would be adorable they would oh there's a bear in this shack i recognize this

04:33:42.460 --> 04:33:51.660
place from many i totally i've never heard a wolf how will like that before but

04:33:51.660 --> 04:33:58.300
Lydia can you deal with them so i don't have to slow down i'm trying to make it to the location

04:34:00.060 --> 04:34:04.940
there is probably bandits here actually that's one thing i do have to complain about scarring

04:34:04.940 --> 04:34:11.500
there's like bandits in every freaking place ever literally i've not even approached this

04:34:11.500 --> 04:34:17.180
landmark and it's like yeah bandits by the way it's like bro i didn't even get a freaking chance

04:34:17.180 --> 04:34:22.060
to breathe there's always a bear foxes are difficult the worst part is they pee on everything

04:34:23.180 --> 04:34:31.820
fox girl gen 2 confirmed made it into peeler confirmed right there's a stable over here so

04:34:31.820 --> 04:34:39.420
we're gonna head for it what's the difference between taming and domesticating

04:34:41.660 --> 04:34:48.300
taming is temporary friendship whereas domestication anyone can take over with it i think

04:34:49.020 --> 04:34:54.780
because you can tame a wild hedgehog but you can't domesticate it

04:34:56.620 --> 04:35:02.700
yeah no that kind of sounds like i'm on the right tracks but i did just i don't actually know the

04:35:02.700 --> 04:35:13.500
real can you please discover that thank you peeler my beloved peeler confirmed by strongy

04:35:13.500 --> 04:35:23.660
fox girl for peeler oh my only reason they're in is because of the the content the girls like to put

04:35:23.660 --> 04:35:30.300
up domestication is an extremely long process of taming yes i would agree with that statement

04:35:30.940 --> 04:35:35.100
well they put fast travel on so they had to compensate for people who'd fast travel instead

04:35:35.100 --> 04:35:40.380
of walk and they need more bandits oh bro every time you want to walk like two centimeters of the

04:35:40.380 --> 04:35:45.580
game's like enemy enemy enemy enemy taming is when you train a wild animal to be friendly

04:35:45.580 --> 04:35:50.060
around humans domestications when you breed an animal over multiple generations to benefit a human

04:35:50.060 --> 04:36:01.500
yes so a lot of people don't know that sheep um infinitely grow will that's because of human

04:36:01.500 --> 04:36:07.340
selective breeding that they produce so much will and they've now require to be shaved like

04:36:07.340 --> 04:36:12.220
you ever hear those stories that make the news that's like this sheep evaded the farmer for five

04:36:12.220 --> 04:36:19.180
years and he has five years of like mats on him and the only reason that's actually even mildly

04:36:19.180 --> 04:36:25.020
possible is because he was bred that way he was bred to produce like copious amounts of wool

04:36:25.740 --> 04:36:31.260
and and it's like the same for horses you know how horses need little clippy cloppy horses

04:36:31.260 --> 04:36:38.700
the reason for that is because of selective breeding and and horse in the wild will naturally wear

04:36:38.700 --> 04:36:47.660
down it's rocks it's hooves on rocks and stuff like that and what is going on here who's this rk

04:36:49.260 --> 04:36:58.140
um right yeah silkworms we use for silk can't survive in the world yeah i would really love to

04:36:58.140 --> 04:37:04.860
do a domestication thing um i'd love to do a history one i just saw that on a per Fox

04:37:05.820 --> 04:37:13.180
that wolf garden huh i don't think i've ever seen a sheep on the news yeah when you come from Scotland

04:37:13.180 --> 04:37:20.940
sometimes the news is rather bland um you know not a lot going on in school if you watch the

04:37:20.940 --> 04:37:32.300
Scottish news oh no he didn't meet why why does the horse who's horse is that hello i'm sorry i'm late

04:37:34.860 --> 04:37:40.380
hydration check i've scouted the ruins and i'm certain carlaya is still inside

04:37:41.660 --> 04:37:48.780
you saw her no i found her horse don't take care of it the horse didn't need to perish

04:37:49.980 --> 04:37:57.340
let's get moving i want to catch her inside while she's distracted take the lead you want me to

04:37:57.340 --> 04:38:02.300
lead understood just make certain you keep your eyes open carlaya is a selectively breeding

04:38:02.940 --> 04:38:08.780
stuff for you can't say that that's hilarious you can't say that oh my god

04:38:10.540 --> 04:38:16.140
that's so true what the fuck that's so funny i'm sorry i can't even laugh at that that's so funny

04:38:24.060 --> 04:38:30.620
i'd rather the news be bland than hyperpolarizing oh i don't even consume the news anymore where

04:38:31.180 --> 04:38:36.060
where are you bro i can hear your armor what are you doing okay there you are jeez

04:38:38.140 --> 04:38:41.900
it's ironic because she's growing so much will have actually become a deficient sheep farmers

04:38:41.900 --> 04:38:47.100
don't make any money from those synthetic fibers if the police will we have to go back

04:38:48.220 --> 04:38:54.860
we need to go back please please no more plastic i'd like

04:38:55.660 --> 04:39:01.740
same i hate watching the yeah like it's just unwatchable it just you you will finish a news

04:39:01.740 --> 04:39:09.180
broadcast um and you're just like wow i hate life and it was like don't if if you consume things

04:39:09.180 --> 04:39:14.380
that like genuinely make you more upset at the end of them it's it can be quite addictive and

04:39:14.380 --> 04:39:19.020
comforting to like watch it in the moment but when you realize it's bad for you like you can just

04:39:19.020 --> 04:39:26.380
kind of poach trump on it you know come back another time uh there are drogger up ahead but

04:39:26.380 --> 04:39:38.860
it's not anything you can't handle the drogger i'm actually gonna loot them the reason because

04:39:38.860 --> 04:39:45.740
a lot of drogger drop um soul gems which i'm needing a heck of a lot more of

04:39:48.940 --> 04:39:53.420
i said they drop soul gems

04:39:56.700 --> 04:40:07.020
soul gems se o a o gems i can see that but i don't mean whoa okay sorry i'm sorry please

04:40:07.100 --> 04:40:09.900
forgive me for pill in the lever i didn't mean i promise i won't do it again

04:40:15.500 --> 04:40:18.220
okay they're just dropping gems i couldn't freaking

04:40:21.020 --> 04:40:23.100
uh i didn't even get a chance to wiggle it

04:40:27.260 --> 04:40:29.260
no no

04:40:29.660 --> 04:40:31.660
oh

04:40:34.620 --> 04:40:41.660
oh potions lovely i'll sell them for pennies honestly will is still warm even wait sorry

04:40:41.660 --> 04:40:44.140
sorry i was looking at the corner of my eye oh

04:40:48.780 --> 04:40:55.260
i can so ends the lesson uh drogger don't usually have soul gems wait who do i think

04:40:55.340 --> 04:41:02.540
have soul gems on them oh the the centaurians have um the the good golden guys no

04:41:06.380 --> 04:41:14.620
i'm like going left side i'm like okay there we go so many soul gems okay they just have gold on

04:41:14.620 --> 04:41:20.140
them apparently we get it

04:41:23.260 --> 04:41:25.820
your feeble attempts he's like so into it

04:41:29.260 --> 04:41:35.260
nope don't ask me how long it took me to find the opening to this so my first playthrough

04:41:35.340 --> 04:41:44.220
it's so painful this was my first ever um skyrim game actually my dad played morrowind um

04:41:45.580 --> 04:41:50.780
but my my favorite thing about morrowind is that you can just jump on the spot um

04:41:53.020 --> 04:41:55.660
and then like you level up your stamina it's quite interesting

04:41:56.380 --> 04:42:03.500
you mean elder school's game yeah wait what did i say my first skyrim game

04:42:06.620 --> 04:42:07.580
i'm like dumb dumb

04:42:11.100 --> 04:42:18.460
and he i was gonna say it's even oh no not me right now ryan hey strongy i wanted to ask you

04:42:18.460 --> 04:42:23.500
something yeah i know you can speak scott but i was curious to know if you knew gaelic as well

04:42:23.500 --> 04:42:28.620
cause if i remember correctly there's not that many people left in scotland that can speak it

04:42:28.620 --> 04:42:34.540
no they don't teach us that uh if you come from the mainland you don't learn gaelic at all um

04:42:35.420 --> 04:42:41.180
it's basically a dying language because they refuse to teach it to the next generation

04:42:41.980 --> 04:42:47.740
i don't know if it's gonna change i hope it'll change in the future but sadly no i do not speak

04:42:47.820 --> 04:42:54.860
gaelic which is just how it is they do not teach it and oh pretty ship

04:42:57.980 --> 04:43:04.460
um but thank you for the tip narrow yes uh very sadly they they don't teach it uh if you're

04:43:04.460 --> 04:43:09.500
from the mainland of scotland and i am from the mainland of scotland if you didn't know lovely

04:43:09.500 --> 04:43:18.620
little uh skull wait no did i mean to do that i don't think i meant to do that did i um

04:43:20.620 --> 04:43:26.860
if i didn't come from the mainland and i came from the shetland for example which is at the north

04:43:26.860 --> 04:43:33.020
some it's okay if you don't really know scotland that well um where the heck is this red on the

04:43:33.020 --> 04:43:35.340
map did i get up am i going the right way

04:43:38.300 --> 04:43:41.580
yell skeever okay i'm going the right way i don't know how to do that

04:43:42.700 --> 04:43:46.700
that's so sad gaelic is one of the very few Celtic languages i left yeah like um

04:43:48.940 --> 04:43:51.260
scotland and ireland and all that were like pagan

04:43:51.900 --> 04:44:01.180

04:44:43.740 --> 04:44:51.820
um yes i am very lucky that i do have scots at least which is recognized as its own language

04:44:51.820 --> 04:44:58.700
which is really cool uh i know it sounds like i'm like speaking it's because i don't use slang

04:44:58.700 --> 04:45:06.940

04:46:14.380 --> 04:46:21.180
my mom was like no then he speaks slang in the house so i didn't and then obviously being an

04:46:21.180 --> 04:46:26.220
online creator it's a complete opposite everyone wants to hear you with a slang in every hand and

04:46:26.220 --> 04:46:33.100
it's like oh right then i guess it's a bit uh it's a bit forced because i was discouraged from

04:46:33.100 --> 04:46:40.540
speaking slang these doors have a weakness pc got updates xbox charges per update thus pc got

04:46:40.540 --> 04:46:45.660

he delayed the shipment even another week the legion would find someone else to take it

04:58:03.900 --> 04:58:09.260
south let them keep their blasted money the road to white run is dangerous he says everyone knows

04:58:09.260 --> 04:58:13.260
that so many caravans have been attacked so many travelers vanishing in thin air some say it's

04:58:13.260 --> 04:58:18.300
only bandits but they're rumors are worse goblins ghosts and witches 20 years we've been married

04:58:18.300 --> 04:58:21.980
now and i can't bear the thought of losing them i'm not letting them go alone not this time we'll

04:58:21.980 --> 04:58:31.260
deliver die together together mara preservas oh where's the man oh no

04:58:34.940 --> 04:58:41.980
oh who to who to uh it's terrible picks up coins oh who did that that's terrible

04:58:42.620 --> 04:58:50.300
uh coconut crab vtuber oh isn't that not that massive gigantic crab

04:58:54.620 --> 04:59:00.460
v sucky is gen 2's name by the way yeah gen 2 already i already have the logos for gen 2 and

04:59:00.460 --> 04:59:05.580
three maids um because they were they it was like cheap and it was like i might as well well as the

04:59:05.580 --> 04:59:10.220
matter because i already know what i'm gonna call them i'm just gonna discover this location

04:59:10.940 --> 04:59:14.620
i don't know if we're gonna start going against the force one shortly there are another

04:59:14.620 --> 04:59:24.860
type of bandits essentially uh right how'd i get around i guess i get around oh no rubs corpses

04:59:24.860 --> 04:59:29.820
look they're not gonna need it let's be honest they're not gonna need that those nine coins

04:59:29.820 --> 04:59:35.020
gen 3 spoiled no there's absolutely nothing planned of gen 3 i don't even know what concepts i want

04:59:35.820 --> 04:59:42.220
um and stroney did you see what you want yes what i want i submit what i want and then i get back

04:59:42.220 --> 04:59:49.020
something and then i keep going to the drawing board that's how it works so you're at my mercy

04:59:51.420 --> 05:00:01.340
shoulda picked mercy you can't purchase in the afterlife gen 6 confront absolutely no i i am done

05:00:02.140 --> 05:00:08.940
birthing any children after gen 3 i mean it's also like uh there's a whole other thing to it

05:00:08.940 --> 05:00:15.580
there's actually a whole other trust factor as well like gen one i completely trust whole heartedly

05:00:16.140 --> 05:00:20.700
like i did my thorough research on the girls and like when i when i did the interview like i never

05:00:20.700 --> 05:00:27.260
got any bad vibes or whatever um which sounds terrible like oh you did an interview like an

05:00:27.260 --> 05:00:33.580
informal interview and went off of was there bad vibes or not and the answer is yeah i did actually

05:00:33.580 --> 05:00:39.900
um because and when you hear people talk you can get a sense of like especially when they

05:00:39.900 --> 05:00:46.380
expected like a super um like a super professional thing and you're just like oh surprise it's

05:00:46.380 --> 05:00:52.220
actually just me me man uh here's here's the rules type thing um mercy's patreon just went live oh she

05:00:52.220 --> 05:00:59.740
got an update i can't even remember what her update was i i don't know i don't know what the tags are

05:00:59.740 --> 05:01:05.500
even though i was the one who put that up there for her sounds like you got a trust your gut yeah

05:01:05.500 --> 05:01:10.460
like i get described as naive a lot which i honestly don't mind i actually genuinely agree with that

05:01:10.460 --> 05:01:16.860
and kind of assassin sorry i'm just trying to hit loads of markers along the way so we can just

05:01:16.860 --> 05:01:23.420
backtrack like this super easily um oh is this like a little hunter's lodge thing going on oh it's

05:01:23.420 --> 05:01:36.380
like a little campsite oh just we eat and good tonight after three generations there's a real

05:01:36.460 --> 05:01:46.460
risk of bad actors trying to get in it yeah so because i need to choose my words carefully

05:01:47.180 --> 05:01:56.540
but i hope you can agree with um my my my thought process but it may not be reality because it's

05:01:56.540 --> 05:02:06.380
just my thought process um it is very plausible that there were v-tubers who were interested but

05:02:06.380 --> 05:02:13.260
didn't apply because they wanted the guaranteed success of gen 2 like to see what gen 1 achieved

05:02:13.260 --> 05:02:22.060
to see what gen 2 achieved because not that they didn't put their faith in the plan

05:02:22.460 --> 05:02:28.780
um it's not so obviously you want to you want to be a part something that's successful let's wait

05:02:28.780 --> 05:02:36.700
am i on the right way or am i on the wrong way no i'm gonna run um i need to try and think of

05:02:36.700 --> 05:02:47.980
my sense just like i'm really happy with gen 1 and everyone is good basically however the rate

05:02:47.980 --> 05:02:55.180
as you said the rate of a bad actor coming into play does get higher um

05:02:58.140 --> 05:03:03.820
but hopefully you know there's girls like with you know plenty of experience and i can just

05:03:03.820 --> 05:03:11.820
see and assess them you don't want to risk the gamble yes it's like i don't know how to say that

05:03:11.820 --> 05:03:17.900
i just knew all the girl i'm trying to have a really nice moment talking about my girls okay um

05:03:20.060 --> 05:03:27.100
the risk does get higher when new people are introduced that may not have previous history

05:03:27.100 --> 05:03:35.340
like um what the heck what am i trying to where the heck am i trying to go you can't see me

05:03:36.220 --> 05:03:37.740
um

05:03:41.340 --> 05:03:43.660
i think you're doing the right thing you don't want to feel like you're

05:03:43.660 --> 05:03:50.220
investing your time into the wrong thing yes that like um i did speak of someone who applied

05:03:50.220 --> 05:03:54.940
and then i went on their twitch just to check them out in general and they spoke about how

05:03:54.940 --> 05:04:00.540
they only want to hang around for one year and then send their audience to their old account

05:04:01.260 --> 05:04:05.420
and the quote was like because the creator seems so chill or something

05:04:06.140 --> 05:04:13.820
and i got an in route um and it was just like kind of shocking and it does like kind of slap

05:04:13.820 --> 05:04:19.340
me back to reality that like people who apply they might not actually want to hang around and

05:04:19.340 --> 05:04:26.940
achieve like loads of goals they might just do it to go do their own thing the lover stone this

05:04:26.940 --> 05:04:34.860
this always feels the comforts love all skills improve faster if all skills improve faster than

05:04:34.860 --> 05:04:44.620
sure call me the lover stone who would put that on social me out wow wow you know that really

05:04:44.620 --> 05:04:51.980
happened um they applied their application and i pretty much checked out everyone's stream

05:04:52.780 --> 05:04:58.620
um uh after they applied just to see what they were putting out there because um there was a

05:04:58.620 --> 05:05:05.020
very notable trend of people applying and then all of a sudden their stream uh consistency

05:05:05.020 --> 05:05:09.740
ramped up because they were getting assessed and they were aware they were getting assessed uh

05:05:09.740 --> 05:05:16.380
i don't think i didn't notice that if you were one of those girls um uh there was also stream

05:05:16.380 --> 05:05:25.020
variety came out nowhere some people were very glued to one type of game zero um um and all of

05:05:25.020 --> 05:05:32.700
a sudden they start doing a variety of games kind of showing that they can uh play a different

05:05:32.700 --> 05:05:45.180
among the games um but yes um i did get to experience someone who openly admitted that they

05:05:46.620 --> 05:05:52.860
basically applied but couldn't care less about the actual longevity of violour and it is quite

05:05:52.860 --> 05:06:01.340
scary to think that there's a possibility that even through my vetting process um there is a team

05:06:01.340 --> 05:06:13.260
who also assessed uh the girls that get in as well um and maybe at a later date i can maybe speak a bit

05:06:13.260 --> 05:06:18.380
more about it i think now is a bit too sensitive of a time because obviously it's only been

05:06:19.660 --> 05:06:25.660
one week excuse me sorry just dealing with this guy

05:06:26.620 --> 05:06:31.100
uh he is a very bad man do not trust him are you good

05:06:34.940 --> 05:06:41.980
oh good thank you here well what do we get i think we get a gold band from or something

05:06:44.460 --> 05:06:52.380
uh why were they after you no um does that affect your judgment what does what affect

05:06:52.380 --> 05:06:57.660
my judgment i'm so sorry you're gonna have to go over that again i'm sorry i completely forget uh

05:06:57.660 --> 05:07:04.300
what my like previous sense was azure's voice was too perfect for the character yes i i did

05:07:04.300 --> 05:07:09.660
admit that if azura did not accept uh i was essentially up shit creek because everyone

05:07:09.660 --> 05:07:16.860
who applied i was not satisfied with their fit for the voice i did say though i said it before

05:07:16.860 --> 05:07:24.380
anyone's like that's not fair they were born that way they just got in uh what about rooting for

05:14:43.820 --> 05:14:48.140
am i i thought you were supposed to go that way no i just took poison damage for the hell

05:14:48.140 --> 05:14:55.660
a bit i was so fun i should do that again not wait did i not come from here

05:14:57.820 --> 05:15:03.340
what am i who or have i gone the completely wrong way

05:15:03.340 --> 05:15:07.260
okay i think i'm i may have

05:15:09.100 --> 05:15:12.700
i think i went completely the wrong way pardon me i took it take a look at me

05:15:15.500 --> 05:15:20.300
uh it's barred from the other side so i was going the right freaking way

05:15:21.500 --> 05:15:23.260
uh right okay let's try again

05:15:25.020 --> 05:15:31.020
okay i'm sure i can figure it out when i get there i feel like a some secret offer

05:15:31.900 --> 05:15:37.820
no these are these are living quarters you're the stealthiest thief ever strong

05:15:37.820 --> 05:15:42.620
and no one will see you if they're dead exactly i don't know why that's still going

05:15:43.980 --> 05:15:48.140
because i pulled a lever uh i think i did it on the other side of the poison

05:15:50.060 --> 05:15:54.300
uh i guess if you wanted to be stealth you could just go through the poison

05:15:54.300 --> 05:15:55.660
but we'll just go for it

05:15:55.820 --> 05:16:01.260
we're going we're going we're going

05:16:04.620 --> 05:16:08.860
i'm being a dome dome okay turn that off

05:16:11.740 --> 05:16:15.820
right there so it's quiet and then up the stairs literally they were right there

05:16:15.820 --> 05:16:20.700
and i walked away from them it's just feeling quirky okay just feeling misunderstood

05:16:21.260 --> 05:16:24.780
oh

05:16:24.780 --> 05:16:29.820
just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen

05:16:29.820 --> 05:16:32.220
it's okay just let it happen

05:16:37.740 --> 05:16:38.860
just let it happen

05:16:41.980 --> 05:16:48.780
just let it happen it's okay it's okay just let it happen

05:16:48.780 --> 05:16:51.780
Mmm, big potatoes.

05:16:51.780 --> 05:16:55.780
Just, oh, 20.

05:16:55.780 --> 05:16:56.780
Enchanting!

05:16:56.780 --> 05:16:57.780
That's good.

05:16:57.780 --> 05:17:00.780
That would be like enchanting up in here.

05:17:00.780 --> 05:17:01.780
Just let it happen.

05:17:01.780 --> 05:17:03.780
Okay, we don't really need to...

05:17:03.780 --> 05:17:04.780
Oh, the box!

05:17:04.780 --> 05:17:06.780
We need that.

05:17:06.780 --> 05:17:11.780
Mmm, is this the barred door?

05:17:11.780 --> 05:17:12.780
It was!

05:17:12.780 --> 05:17:15.780
Okay, we've now got the shark cut up.

05:17:15.780 --> 05:17:17.780
So what's this?

05:17:17.780 --> 05:17:19.780
It's a chest.

05:17:19.780 --> 05:17:21.780
Ah, and then what's that?

05:17:21.780 --> 05:17:23.780
That's just the other side of the map.

05:17:23.780 --> 05:17:24.780
Oh my god, we did it.

05:17:24.780 --> 05:17:25.780
It's not war crime.

05:17:25.780 --> 05:17:27.780
It's just a cute girl.

05:17:27.780 --> 05:17:30.780
Me committing war crimes?

05:17:30.780 --> 05:17:33.780
Stop, you're making me laugh.

05:17:33.780 --> 05:17:35.780
Oh my gosh, I'm so turned around.

05:17:35.780 --> 05:17:39.780
It's been so long since I've done this.

05:17:39.780 --> 05:17:41.780
It's called Barbarian Stealth.

05:17:41.780 --> 05:17:46.780
Honestly, I actually really like that description for my thingy.

05:17:46.780 --> 05:17:48.780
I've always tried to do...

05:17:48.780 --> 05:17:51.780
What the heck?

05:17:51.780 --> 05:17:52.780
Jump shot.

05:17:52.780 --> 05:17:53.780
Oh, right.

05:17:53.780 --> 05:17:54.780
Wait, what?

05:17:54.780 --> 05:17:55.780
Where's the...

05:17:55.780 --> 05:17:58.780
There's a tic-tac to leave there.

05:17:58.780 --> 05:18:02.780
I don't think there's any enemies until they come in.

05:18:02.780 --> 05:18:05.780
We just need to pick up some charcoal and a piece of paper,

05:18:05.780 --> 05:18:08.780
steal the paper, steal the charcoal.

05:18:08.780 --> 05:18:12.780
It took me so long to figure out this area.

05:18:12.780 --> 05:18:14.780
Heavy armor increased to 16.

05:18:14.780 --> 05:18:17.780
It wasn't really worth the level up, but hey, we did it.

05:18:17.780 --> 05:18:18.780
I'm going to break some...

05:18:18.780 --> 05:18:19.780
Break it down now.

05:18:24.780 --> 05:18:25.780
Oh, look at that.

05:18:25.780 --> 05:18:27.780
Look at that.

05:18:27.780 --> 05:18:29.780
We do have a bow and arrow.

05:18:29.780 --> 05:18:30.780
Fire damage?

05:18:30.780 --> 05:18:31.780
Soul trap?

05:18:31.780 --> 05:18:32.780
Maybe...

05:18:32.780 --> 05:18:36.780
No, maybe not a soul trap on us.

05:18:36.780 --> 05:18:38.780
I would say fire damage.

05:18:38.780 --> 05:18:40.780
Take a little burn.

05:18:40.780 --> 05:18:42.780
Now, what pet are your...

05:18:42.780 --> 05:18:45.780
Bubbish.

05:18:45.780 --> 05:18:49.780
You know Seagrog method of stealth, honestly.

05:18:49.780 --> 05:18:52.780
Look, if it works, is there...

05:18:52.780 --> 05:18:54.780
Is there truly a point?

05:18:54.780 --> 05:18:55.780
Is there truly a point?

05:18:55.780 --> 05:18:58.780
Right, so the enemies do come in here.

05:18:58.780 --> 05:19:01.780
Obviously, because we are playing on legendary mode,

05:19:01.780 --> 05:19:03.780
and I'm just so MLG pro.

05:19:03.780 --> 05:19:04.780
Excuse me.

05:19:04.780 --> 05:19:07.780
We're just going to one-shot them, confidently.

05:19:07.780 --> 05:19:09.780
We are just going to one-shot them, confidently.

05:19:09.780 --> 05:19:13.780
We are just going to one-shot them.

05:19:13.780 --> 05:19:14.780
Nice and confidently.

05:19:14.780 --> 05:19:15.780
No problems.

05:19:19.780 --> 05:19:21.780
Acutely commits crimes against humans, honestly.

05:19:24.780 --> 05:19:27.780
Have you played Ghost of Toshima?

05:19:27.780 --> 05:19:28.780
I haven't.

05:19:28.780 --> 05:19:29.780
One shot, 100%.

05:19:29.780 --> 05:19:30.780
Return to the guy.

05:19:30.780 --> 05:19:31.780
Where's the guy?

05:19:31.780 --> 05:19:33.780
Is he in here?

05:19:34.780 --> 05:19:36.780
Oh, return to the guy guy.

05:19:36.780 --> 05:19:38.780
Return to the guy.

05:19:40.780 --> 05:19:41.780
Walk on.

05:19:45.780 --> 05:19:48.780
Why the heck does it make me go backwards?

05:19:52.780 --> 05:19:54.780
It says games, but...

05:19:54.780 --> 05:19:57.780
The mapping is a bit rough.

05:20:01.780 --> 05:20:03.780
Can I loot this account?

05:20:03.780 --> 05:20:05.780
They're so good.

05:20:05.780 --> 05:20:07.780
Wait, are the guards going to attack me?

05:20:07.780 --> 05:20:14.080
Are the Marker of Guards going to attack me? I'll pick them out.

05:20:14.080 --> 05:20:18.340
I come back and see you're still in- Eh, no!

05:20:18.340 --> 05:20:24.260
I'm sorry but these accusations are unfounded. I'm not a novice, I'm a legendary, clearly.

05:20:24.260 --> 05:20:29.940
Look, I'm sorry to your untrained eye, but when you get really good at the game, it just

05:20:29.940 --> 05:20:36.100
makes things- Why did it do that? Why did you do that?

05:20:36.100 --> 05:20:40.700
Why does the game do that? Honestly, I could fart on it something.

05:20:40.700 --> 05:20:47.260
Yeah, just- It's because I'm such a high-skilled level, it makes it appear to be a very easy level.

05:20:47.260 --> 05:20:50.380
So please don't worry about it.

05:20:50.380 --> 05:20:54.140
No, okay.

05:20:54.140 --> 05:21:00.860
The mages don't let us go into the hall. The mages don't let us go into the hall.

05:21:00.860 --> 05:21:04.180
I've played this game for two- Eh, how dare you?

05:21:04.180 --> 05:21:07.660
Why is the child in the basement?

05:21:07.660 --> 05:21:11.300
Right, here's the translations, bro.

05:21:11.300 --> 05:21:16.060
I'm rubbing, eh?

05:21:16.060 --> 05:21:21.700
When you're amazing, you make everything look easy. Yeah, legendary keyboard.

05:21:21.700 --> 05:21:25.340
See how that's not valued at 50? It's not going to teach you nothing.

05:21:25.340 --> 05:21:29.460
Don't open that book.

05:21:29.460 --> 05:21:32.580
Maybe sometime you should judge a bit, but cover.

05:21:32.580 --> 05:21:37.580
It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the guild for

05:21:37.580 --> 05:21:38.580
months.

05:21:38.580 --> 05:21:42.580
Mercer Frey is the baddie! Dun, dun, dun!

05:21:42.580 --> 05:21:50.820
A very lavish lifestyle, replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures.

05:21:50.820 --> 05:21:53.900
That's actually my specialty.

05:21:53.900 --> 05:21:58.540
And yes, Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the guild's treasury

05:21:58.540 --> 05:22:01.060
without anyone's knowledge.

05:22:01.060 --> 05:22:06.580
Anything else, Enzo? Anything about the Nightingales?

05:22:06.580 --> 05:22:09.300
The Nightingales!

05:22:09.300 --> 05:22:14.500
The last few pages seem to describe the failure of the Nightingales, although it doesn't go

05:22:14.500 --> 05:22:16.580
into great detail.

05:22:16.580 --> 05:22:22.020
Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known

05:22:22.020 --> 05:22:25.100
as the Twilight Sepulcher.

05:22:25.100 --> 05:22:28.140
Shadows preserve us, so it's true.

05:22:28.140 --> 05:22:29.980
She bald under that hood!

05:22:29.980 --> 05:22:34.060
She's not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher, but what is it?

05:22:34.060 --> 05:22:36.620
What's Mercer Frey done?

05:22:36.620 --> 05:22:38.980
The Annoying Hunt is actually the bad guy.

05:22:38.980 --> 05:22:41.260
I'm shocked! Color of me surprised.

05:22:41.260 --> 05:22:45.620
The gold and right in standards by the dev team.

05:22:45.620 --> 05:22:47.300
What's called express.

05:22:47.300 --> 05:22:49.780
Bald! It always annoyed me.

05:22:49.780 --> 05:22:58.220
When you put on a hood, your hair gets removed and it annoys me so much.

05:22:58.220 --> 05:22:59.220
It's just such a...

05:22:59.220 --> 05:23:00.220
Get away from me!

05:23:00.220 --> 05:23:04.060
Excuse you, anyone talking to you?

05:23:04.060 --> 05:23:08.580
Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the guild.

05:23:08.580 --> 05:23:11.380
They respected Carlyer and she deserves better.

05:23:11.380 --> 05:23:14.540
Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor.

05:23:14.540 --> 05:23:16.020
Sure! Thank you!

05:23:16.020 --> 05:23:20.700
You ever managed to gain entry to the college and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen

05:23:20.700 --> 05:23:21.700
goods?

05:23:21.700 --> 05:23:23.500
He's a fan!

05:23:23.500 --> 05:23:28.180
I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time.

05:23:28.180 --> 05:23:29.780
Questionable interest or like that.

05:23:29.780 --> 05:23:32.140
You must hasten to rift in before Mercer can do any more.

05:23:32.140 --> 05:23:35.140
You must hasten to rift in!

05:23:35.140 --> 05:23:39.140
You've come this far, so I see no harm in conceiving it any longer.

05:23:39.140 --> 05:23:40.940
Bald gen two member confirmed!

05:23:40.940 --> 05:23:42.940
No! No!

05:23:42.940 --> 05:23:44.940
Say it ain't so!

05:23:44.940 --> 05:23:51.940
I will not go, turn the lights off, carry me home!

05:23:51.940 --> 05:23:58.260
Oh my god, members karaoke, I can absolutely wreck my voice on that.

05:23:58.260 --> 05:24:00.020
I can get beer!

05:24:00.020 --> 05:24:02.540
I can get beer!

05:24:02.540 --> 05:24:06.660
And we can do membership karaoke!

05:24:06.660 --> 05:24:12.540
And I can do song requests, like you guys put it together, oh I'm pretty good.

05:24:12.540 --> 05:24:21.540
And drink to your family, drink it with your friends, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

05:24:21.540 --> 05:24:30.540
Beer they only drink is made for you, you'll drink till you spew, ew!

05:24:30.540 --> 05:24:36.540
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

05:24:36.540 --> 05:24:42.540
Carla currently and kindly explaining the nightingale lore in her relationship to Gaelas,

05:24:42.540 --> 05:24:48.540
whilst I sing that one beer parody song that had that Lego animation.

05:24:48.540 --> 05:24:50.540
Why are you in the basement child?

05:24:50.540 --> 05:24:53.540
I'm getting, I'm getting weirded out.

05:24:53.540 --> 05:24:56.540
Get, just leave me alone!

05:24:56.540 --> 05:24:58.540
Get away!

05:24:58.540 --> 05:25:04.540
Creepy wee thing, honestly.

05:25:04.540 --> 05:25:09.540
And you sing Flare of Scotland, no I have to be hate music, I'm not singing, I'm not getting drunk and going

05:25:09.540 --> 05:25:22.540
Oh, Flare of Scotland, when will we see our life again?

05:25:22.540 --> 05:25:25.540
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

05:25:25.540 --> 05:25:30.540
I don't know why national songs insist on going so high.

05:25:30.540 --> 05:25:43.540
Like, they, can't you not just, give me one song where like the decibels, the decibels, like the notes in it are just like really common and everyone can sing it.

05:25:43.540 --> 05:25:45.540
Donald, where are your choosers?

05:25:45.540 --> 05:25:47.540
What's that song? I think I've ever heard of it.

05:25:47.540 --> 05:25:49.540
I missed beer whilst I was grabbing a drink.

05:25:49.540 --> 05:25:56.540
No, no, no, we're gonna do like drunk membership thingy.

05:25:56.540 --> 05:25:58.540
Back to where I am.

05:25:58.540 --> 05:26:01.540
Petra also bad poops in.

05:26:01.540 --> 05:26:04.540
I'm ready, let's go.

05:26:04.540 --> 05:26:09.540
I was gonna force us to sing Christmas carols on Christmas.

05:26:09.540 --> 05:26:13.540
I like A Wee and a Manger.

05:26:13.540 --> 05:26:17.540
A Wee and a Manger.

05:26:17.540 --> 05:26:20.540
No crib for a pit.

05:26:20.540 --> 05:26:22.540
Why does it go so high pitch?

05:26:22.540 --> 05:26:25.540
Why can't they not just have a song that's like down here?

05:26:25.540 --> 05:26:28.540
No crib for a bed.

05:26:28.540 --> 05:26:35.540
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.

05:26:35.540 --> 05:26:42.540
The cattle are lowing.

05:26:42.540 --> 05:26:52.540
Oh yeah, I was gonna force you guys to do like freaking Christmas songs with me and then we watch Lord of the Rings on Christmas.

05:26:52.540 --> 05:26:58.540
Let the winds blow high, let the winds blow to the streets and my cattle go.

05:26:58.540 --> 05:27:00.540
Although as you say, oh Donald, where are you?

05:27:00.540 --> 05:27:02.540
What the frick, I've never heard that.

05:27:02.540 --> 05:27:06.540
Do your tit-sangle, do they wobble to the floor?

05:27:06.540 --> 05:27:11.540
I can't say that, I'm sorry.

05:27:11.540 --> 05:27:16.540
I'm getting a bit, I'm getting a bit delirious, hold on a minute.

05:27:16.540 --> 05:27:18.540
You've never heard that song before?

05:27:18.540 --> 05:27:21.540
I've never heard that song before.

05:27:21.540 --> 05:27:24.540
Now what's this song called?

05:27:24.540 --> 05:27:26.540
I've got a sister.

05:27:26.540 --> 05:27:27.540
She's not even drunk yet.

05:27:27.540 --> 05:27:29.540
Just talking about alcohol is getting me steaming.

05:27:29.540 --> 05:27:31.540
It's making me lose the plot.

05:27:31.540 --> 05:27:32.540
Let me see.

05:27:32.540 --> 05:27:34.540
No, it can't be.

05:27:34.540 --> 05:27:35.540
No, it can't be.

05:27:35.540 --> 05:27:36.540
What's that mean?

05:27:36.540 --> 05:27:37.540
I've known Mercer too long.

05:27:37.540 --> 05:27:39.540
He quoted the main.

05:27:39.540 --> 05:27:41.540
The floor?

05:27:41.540 --> 05:27:42.540
Yeah, it's a bit dark.

05:27:42.540 --> 05:27:44.540
We're currently in the sewers.

05:27:44.540 --> 05:27:46.540
Right under your nose.

05:27:46.540 --> 05:27:47.540
Do they wobble to the floor?

05:27:48.540 --> 05:27:50.540
Can you tie them in the knot?

05:27:50.540 --> 05:27:53.540
Can you tie them in a bow?

05:27:53.540 --> 05:27:57.540
My kami oshii hates Mongolian throat singing.

05:27:57.540 --> 05:28:00.540
It's because cats don't like the sound of that vibration

05:28:00.540 --> 05:28:02.540
that Mongolian throat singing provides.

05:28:02.540 --> 05:28:04.540
So thus, I don't like it.

05:28:04.540 --> 05:28:06.540
I don't like vibrations.

05:28:06.540 --> 05:28:08.540
That rrrrrrrrr.

05:28:08.540 --> 05:28:09.540
No, bad.

05:28:09.540 --> 05:28:10.540
Cats don't like it.

05:28:10.540 --> 05:28:12.540
It makes their ears go back.

05:28:12.540 --> 05:28:16.540
So it makes my ears go back.

05:28:16.540 --> 05:28:18.540
The world's greatest thieves live in a sewer.

05:28:18.540 --> 05:28:20.540
Down in the sewer.

05:28:22.540 --> 05:28:25.540
Ever listen to the nasty shrank licks?

05:28:28.540 --> 05:28:30.540
Let's go.

05:28:30.540 --> 05:28:32.540
The memer is starting to break free.

05:28:32.540 --> 05:28:36.540
I want to break free.

05:28:36.540 --> 05:28:38.540
My cat licks it.

05:28:38.540 --> 05:28:41.540
Your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing

05:28:41.540 --> 05:28:44.540
and I will not be taking any further statements.

05:28:44.540 --> 05:28:48.540
I assure you, your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing.

05:28:48.540 --> 05:28:49.540
Base cat.

05:28:49.540 --> 05:28:51.540
Absolutely not.

05:28:51.540 --> 05:28:53.540
Are you sure about that?

05:28:53.540 --> 05:28:55.540
Rip project when my OSD fans and shambles

05:28:55.540 --> 05:28:58.540
due to the Mongolian throat singing hate.

05:28:58.540 --> 05:29:03.540
Me, my life away.

05:29:03.540 --> 05:29:05.540
I was so hard to sing that.

05:29:05.540 --> 05:29:07.540
Any song is hard to sing.

05:29:07.540 --> 05:29:09.540
My voice is so frazzled.

05:29:09.540 --> 05:29:13.540
I'm just a memer.

05:29:13.540 --> 05:29:18.540
I mean my life away.

05:29:18.540 --> 05:29:20.540
Sorry, the thieves gold are now just revealing

05:29:20.540 --> 05:29:23.540
that Mercer has betrayed them for many years

05:29:23.540 --> 05:29:25.540
and there's not a penny left for them.

05:29:25.540 --> 05:29:31.540
I mean my life away.

05:29:31.540 --> 05:29:33.540
Away.

05:29:33.540 --> 05:29:36.540
Why is camera the frog in the stream?

05:29:37.540 --> 05:29:39.540
Crematy frog here.

05:29:39.540 --> 05:29:43.540
I would like to do some karaoke.

05:29:43.540 --> 05:29:46.540
Sing your cover live.

05:29:46.540 --> 05:29:49.540
He also like rock music.

05:29:49.540 --> 05:29:51.540
We doubt you don't like vibrations.

05:29:51.540 --> 05:29:56.540
I've got an even funner fact.

05:29:56.540 --> 05:30:02.540
I only like it.

05:30:02.540 --> 05:30:04.540
Yes, yes, yes.

05:30:04.540 --> 05:30:06.540
I killed Gallus, not Carly.

05:30:06.540 --> 05:30:10.540
Gallus, Carly and Mercer were Nightingales.

05:30:10.540 --> 05:30:14.540
Carly was behind Golden Glow and Honeybrook.

05:30:14.540 --> 05:30:17.540
Say it.

05:30:17.540 --> 05:30:23.540
The magic button cannot handle the vibration.

05:30:23.540 --> 05:30:28.540
But the dirt road home can.

05:30:28.540 --> 05:30:29.540
Oh I have permission.

05:30:29.540 --> 05:30:31.540
Okay infiltrate Mercer's home.

05:30:31.540 --> 05:30:33.540
Oh everyone's on alert.

05:30:33.540 --> 05:30:36.540
Alert, alert, Mercer.

05:30:36.540 --> 05:30:40.540
Alert, alert.

05:30:40.540 --> 05:30:44.540
Oh I bet we are but you should be here.

05:30:44.540 --> 05:30:47.540
I don't doubt for one second.

05:30:47.540 --> 05:30:48.540
I won't remember that.

05:30:48.540 --> 05:30:50.540
Please continue.

05:30:50.540 --> 05:30:52.540
Information stored and saved.

05:30:52.540 --> 05:30:57.540
Yeah, literally there's no doubt about it.

05:30:57.540 --> 05:30:59.540
The tales get it back.

05:30:59.540 --> 05:31:02.540
I didn't realise how fake speedish

05:31:02.540 --> 05:31:05.540
that all the voice actors accent try to mimic.

05:31:05.540 --> 05:31:07.540
It's actually quite jarring.

05:31:07.540 --> 05:31:09.540
Be careful.

05:31:09.540 --> 05:31:10.540
What are you talking about?

05:31:10.540 --> 05:31:13.540
Hello, hello.

05:31:13.540 --> 05:31:16.540
This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors.

05:31:16.540 --> 05:31:17.540
Now go away.

05:31:17.540 --> 05:31:19.540
I need to get inside Mercer's house please.

05:31:19.540 --> 05:31:21.540
No visitors, no way.

05:31:21.540 --> 05:31:24.540
Now piss off before you make me mad.

05:31:24.540 --> 05:31:27.540
I'll make it worth your while.

05:31:27.540 --> 05:31:30.540
You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away.

05:31:30.540 --> 05:31:32.540
Unless you can talk to Maven Blackbriar

05:31:32.540 --> 05:31:33.540
and let me out of my debt.

05:31:33.540 --> 05:31:34.540
Okay.

05:31:34.540 --> 05:31:37.540
Try and set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off.

05:31:37.540 --> 05:31:42.540
Fine, I'll go talk to Maven about big, big,

05:31:42.540 --> 05:31:44.540
big stinky, what's your name?

05:31:44.540 --> 05:31:51.540
Bald, more like cold because it's freezing outside

05:31:51.540 --> 05:31:53.540
and you're not wearing any outfit.

05:31:53.540 --> 05:31:56.540
Oh, absolutely rolled and decked.

05:31:56.540 --> 05:31:59.540
Hello, America Hiya.

05:31:59.540 --> 05:32:03.540
No, no, no, American.

05:32:03.540 --> 05:32:05.540
Wednesday is her birthday.

05:32:05.540 --> 05:32:08.540
I believe it's the 23rd of August if I'm not mistaken.

05:32:08.540 --> 05:32:10.540
All the crime and corruption in Riften

05:32:10.540 --> 05:32:12.540
is really getting to him.

05:32:12.540 --> 05:32:14.540
And now that we hear rumors about the dragon.

05:32:14.540 --> 05:32:15.540
Is she not up?

05:32:15.540 --> 05:32:17.540
Where is she?

05:32:17.540 --> 05:32:19.540
You have some nerve coming back here

05:32:19.540 --> 05:32:21.540
after what you did to Kirado.

05:32:21.540 --> 05:32:22.540
He less of a shake.

05:32:22.540 --> 05:32:24.540
Where's Maria?

05:32:25.540 --> 05:32:27.540
Okay, hold on.

05:32:27.540 --> 05:32:29.540
If I put that on, it should show more.

05:32:29.540 --> 05:32:30.540
Oh, she is here.

05:32:30.540 --> 05:32:32.540
You were there all along.

05:32:32.540 --> 05:32:35.540
I presume you're bothering me for a while.

05:32:35.540 --> 05:32:38.540
Why would you want to help that idiot?

05:32:38.540 --> 05:32:41.540
He owes me a steep debt.

05:32:41.540 --> 05:32:43.540
In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work.

05:32:43.540 --> 05:32:46.540
If he don't want any of it, I'll take a bell for me.

05:32:46.540 --> 05:32:48.540
What did he do?

05:32:48.540 --> 05:32:50.540
A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill

05:32:50.540 --> 05:32:52.540
from a good friend of mine in Winterhold.

05:32:53.540 --> 05:32:56.540
Do you think Mercer is a claw?

05:33:00.540 --> 05:33:03.540
He's in debt because of a quill?

05:33:13.540 --> 05:33:17.540
Is this his quill that's in the freaking lake?

05:33:22.540 --> 05:33:24.540
Oh, it's...

05:33:25.540 --> 05:33:27.540
Oh, no.

05:33:28.540 --> 05:33:31.540
I think it might just be easier to perish this man.

05:33:33.540 --> 05:33:35.540
I think it's in a boat.

05:33:35.540 --> 05:33:37.540
Oh, goodness me.

05:33:37.540 --> 05:33:38.540
It's been many a year.

05:33:38.540 --> 05:33:40.540
I think it's in a boat.

05:33:40.540 --> 05:33:42.540
I'm gonna have to look at it on the HUD.

05:33:42.540 --> 05:33:43.540
Hold on.

05:33:43.540 --> 05:33:47.540
I want to say it's like somewhere here.

05:33:47.540 --> 05:33:49.540
To the left.

05:33:50.540 --> 05:33:53.540
Oh, I could be terribly wrong though,

05:33:53.540 --> 05:33:56.540
but there should be a boat.

05:33:56.540 --> 05:33:58.540
It started...

05:34:07.540 --> 05:34:09.540
It's at the bottom of the lake somewhere.

05:34:09.540 --> 05:34:11.540
Thank you for your help, Brief.

05:34:11.540 --> 05:34:13.540
No, I really appreciate that.

05:34:13.540 --> 05:34:15.540
I am somewhere at the bottom of the lake.

05:34:15.540 --> 05:34:18.540
I don't even have water breathing either.

05:34:18.540 --> 05:34:19.540
I can't believe you.

05:34:19.540 --> 05:34:21.540
You had the audacity to take that out.

05:34:21.540 --> 05:34:23.540
You're just trying to upset me.

05:34:23.540 --> 05:34:24.540
What's this?

05:34:24.540 --> 05:34:26.540
What's that barnacles?

05:34:29.540 --> 05:34:30.540
I'm already...

05:34:30.540 --> 05:34:31.540
Oh, my...

05:34:33.540 --> 05:34:34.540
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

05:34:34.540 --> 05:34:35.540
Is this a hint?

05:34:35.540 --> 05:34:36.540
Is this a hint?

05:34:36.540 --> 05:34:37.540
Hold on, let me breathe.

05:34:37.540 --> 05:34:40.540
Is this a hint that maybe you were around here somewhere?

05:34:42.540 --> 05:34:43.540
Hold on.

05:34:43.540 --> 05:34:44.540
Right.

05:34:44.540 --> 05:34:45.540
Should we...

05:34:45.540 --> 05:34:46.540
Oh, no.

05:34:46.540 --> 05:34:47.540
Right, well, there was a box,

05:34:47.540 --> 05:34:48.540
but I guess not.

05:34:48.540 --> 05:34:49.540
There's rocks here.

05:34:49.540 --> 05:34:52.540
Is that telling me it's here somewhere?

05:34:52.540 --> 05:34:53.540
Got that barnacles.

05:34:53.540 --> 05:34:54.540
There's more barnacles.

05:34:54.540 --> 05:34:56.540
Oh, can you just, like, render distance, please?

05:34:56.540 --> 05:34:57.540
Stronius.

05:34:57.540 --> 05:34:58.540
Under the water.

05:34:58.540 --> 05:34:59.540
You don't want reflins!

05:35:02.540 --> 05:35:04.540
Ah, let me breathe.

05:35:05.540 --> 05:35:06.540
I seem to think it's, like, the left side.

05:35:06.540 --> 05:35:08.540
I saw that storage box.

05:35:08.540 --> 05:35:10.540
I think that's the game being, like, hint.

05:35:10.540 --> 05:35:11.540
It's over here.

05:35:13.540 --> 05:35:14.540
Okay, hold on.

05:35:14.540 --> 05:35:16.540
Let me just check again.

05:35:17.540 --> 05:35:19.540
I think it's in a broken boat.

05:35:21.540 --> 05:35:23.540
It's on the map somewhere str-

05:35:23.540 --> 05:35:25.540
Right, I'm not reading chat for the next minute.

05:35:25.540 --> 05:35:26.540
You're on time out.

05:35:27.540 --> 05:35:28.540
You're done.

05:35:29.540 --> 05:35:31.540
I seem to think it's close to the edge of the water.

05:35:31.540 --> 05:35:34.540
Wait, oh, this is a bit too close, clearly.

05:35:34.540 --> 05:35:35.540
By the bridge?

05:35:35.540 --> 05:35:38.540
I don't recall it being by a bridge, to be honest.

05:35:42.540 --> 05:35:44.540
You know what, reflin?

05:35:44.540 --> 05:35:45.540
What?

05:35:47.540 --> 05:35:49.540
Stronius, what do you think of the Indiana Jones game?

05:35:49.540 --> 05:35:51.540
I didn't know there was a new one!

05:35:54.540 --> 05:35:55.540
Aw, for goodness' sake.

05:35:55.540 --> 05:35:57.540
I think I'm off the mark.

05:35:57.540 --> 05:35:58.540
Where am I?

05:36:01.540 --> 05:36:03.540
Maybe it's, like, down here a bit.

05:36:03.540 --> 05:36:05.540
I mean, this is the entire area.

05:36:05.540 --> 05:36:08.540
Okay, I'm just gonna do one big glipper on the island.

05:36:08.540 --> 05:36:10.540
Why is there so many salmon?

05:36:11.540 --> 05:36:12.540
Stronius, I love you.

05:36:12.540 --> 05:36:13.540
Don't hate my friends.

05:36:13.540 --> 05:36:15.540
Wait, why would I hate your friends?

05:36:16.540 --> 05:36:17.540
I thought you weren't looking at us.

05:36:17.540 --> 05:36:19.540
Look, I forgive really easily.

05:36:19.540 --> 05:36:20.540
Oh no, get up!

05:36:20.540 --> 05:36:22.540
Shabee, what are you doing?

05:36:22.540 --> 05:36:23.540
Underwater burning.

05:36:23.540 --> 05:36:24.540
Drowning.

05:36:25.540 --> 05:36:29.540
Okay, I don't think it's up this way,

05:36:29.540 --> 05:36:32.540
but we're gonna just do a big circle

05:36:32.540 --> 05:36:35.540
for the sake of satisfying myself.

05:36:39.540 --> 05:36:42.540
Come up for water often.

05:36:43.540 --> 05:36:47.540
Reeflands, remember that Stronius is as much of an addict

05:36:47.540 --> 05:36:48.540
as we are.

05:36:50.540 --> 05:36:52.540
Scuba, Shabee.

05:36:54.540 --> 05:36:56.540
Shabee, making me nervous.

05:36:57.540 --> 05:36:59.540
Oh, wait, it may be on one of these islands.

05:36:59.540 --> 05:37:01.540
It may be rocked up on a baby island.

05:37:01.540 --> 05:37:02.540
Do you know that?

05:37:02.540 --> 05:37:03.540
What the heck was that?

05:37:03.540 --> 05:37:04.540
I'm rabbit!

05:37:07.540 --> 05:37:09.540
Hold on, let's just check the hut again.

05:37:09.540 --> 05:37:12.540
Right, we're kind of at the furthest point

05:37:12.540 --> 05:37:13.540
of this section of the lake.

05:37:13.540 --> 05:37:16.540
I'm not really wanting to go too much further.

05:37:17.540 --> 05:37:19.540
It's near the box you found before.

05:37:19.540 --> 05:37:21.540
Oh my god, I'm actually getting my hand held.

05:37:21.540 --> 05:37:23.540
See, thank you, Reefling.

05:37:23.540 --> 05:37:24.540
I actually get my hand held.

05:37:24.540 --> 05:37:26.540
I knew it was freaking back there.

05:37:26.540 --> 05:37:28.540
I've gone way off course.

05:37:31.540 --> 05:37:32.540
Oh my god, I forgive.

05:37:32.540 --> 05:37:34.540
Fucking Moncaius.

05:37:35.540 --> 05:37:39.540
It's between the big island and Riften.

05:37:40.540 --> 05:37:41.540
That's it, I'm giving in.

05:37:41.540 --> 05:37:43.540
Skyrimmer's been installed.

05:37:43.540 --> 05:37:44.540
Are you happy now?

05:37:44.540 --> 05:37:46.540
Oh, have I put you in the Skyrim mid?

05:37:46.540 --> 05:37:47.540
Yippee!

05:37:47.540 --> 05:37:49.540
I can't help the sarcasm.

05:37:49.540 --> 05:37:50.540
I forget where the thing is every time

05:37:50.540 --> 05:37:51.540
in Wastehaven I was looking.

05:37:51.540 --> 05:37:54.540
Also, it's underwater, not on an island.

05:37:55.540 --> 05:37:57.540
Yeah, it's like crashed off of it.

05:37:58.540 --> 05:38:00.540
My eyes are currently burning,

05:38:00.540 --> 05:38:02.540
opening under the salt water.

05:38:04.540 --> 05:38:06.540
Alright, I'm gonna swim.

05:38:06.540 --> 05:38:07.540
Alright, that's not it.

05:38:07.540 --> 05:38:09.540
These are just textures.

05:38:10.540 --> 05:38:13.540
It's not like this, I can't even swim in.

05:38:14.540 --> 05:38:16.540
So there's no point.

05:38:17.540 --> 05:38:19.540
I'm gonna go buy that box again.

05:38:20.540 --> 05:38:22.540
If I could find the box again.

05:38:23.540 --> 05:38:25.540
We'll float to the right this time,

05:38:25.540 --> 05:38:28.540
not to be confused with the hit TV game.

05:38:28.540 --> 05:38:29.540
A little to the left.

05:38:29.540 --> 05:38:31.540
I don't know why I said TV game.

05:38:32.540 --> 05:38:33.540
Steam game.

05:38:35.540 --> 05:38:39.540
So those were the barnacles.

05:38:42.540 --> 05:38:43.540
I'm getting swept up.

05:38:44.540 --> 05:38:46.540
We're trying to find the quill.

05:38:48.540 --> 05:38:49.540
That maven.

05:38:50.540 --> 05:38:54.540
I did not realise how rubbish this game is.

05:38:54.540 --> 05:38:55.540
Is this for real?

05:38:55.540 --> 05:38:58.540
There's like two floating foxes under the camp.

05:38:59.540 --> 05:39:01.540
What's going on here?

05:39:02.540 --> 05:39:04.540
I can see loads of broken stuff.

05:39:05.540 --> 05:39:07.540
Hold on, let me breathe again.

05:39:10.540 --> 05:39:11.540
Alright.

05:39:12.540 --> 05:39:15.540
Definitely not searchable.

05:39:15.540 --> 05:39:19.540
There's like loads of boxes just hanging off the dock.

05:39:22.540 --> 05:39:23.540
It just works.

05:39:23.540 --> 05:39:26.540
I think you may have floated over it.

05:39:26.540 --> 05:39:28.540
It's not by the docks.

05:39:28.540 --> 05:39:29.540
Oops.

05:39:30.540 --> 05:39:32.540
I like the detail though,

05:39:32.540 --> 05:39:34.540
the concept that like it fell off the boat

05:39:34.540 --> 05:39:36.540
and they can't retrieve it.

05:39:36.540 --> 05:39:37.540
It's quite smart.

05:39:45.540 --> 05:39:47.540
This is where I'm on the map.

05:39:48.540 --> 05:39:50.540
I'm like messing around here.

05:39:52.540 --> 05:39:54.540
Isn't this rock formation maybe?

05:39:56.540 --> 05:39:57.540
What the barnacles?

05:39:58.540 --> 05:40:00.540
Hold on, let me breathe.

05:40:00.540 --> 05:40:01.540
I'm like right...

05:40:01.540 --> 05:40:02.540
I'm like freaking...

05:40:02.540 --> 05:40:03.540
I'm here.

05:40:03.540 --> 05:40:05.540
I doubt it got dropped here.

05:40:05.540 --> 05:40:07.540
It just seems so unlikely.

05:40:07.540 --> 05:40:10.540
Go straight from the docks towards the island.

05:40:12.540 --> 05:40:13.540
Okay.

05:40:22.540 --> 05:40:24.540
I'm searching.

05:40:24.540 --> 05:40:25.540
I'm searching.

05:40:25.540 --> 05:40:26.540
There's salmon.

05:40:26.540 --> 05:40:27.540
There's salmon.

05:40:27.540 --> 05:40:28.540
There's box.

05:40:28.540 --> 05:40:29.540
There's box.

05:40:29.540 --> 05:40:31.540
But it's more towards here.

05:40:34.540 --> 05:40:35.540
Oh, let me breathe.

05:40:35.540 --> 05:40:36.540
Hold on.

05:40:37.540 --> 05:40:38.540
Okay.

05:40:41.540 --> 05:40:42.540
Okay, this is new.

05:40:42.540 --> 05:40:44.540
I don't think we've investigated this.

05:40:45.540 --> 05:40:46.540
Maybe we have.

05:40:50.540 --> 05:40:52.540
I have a freaking potion of water breathing

05:40:52.540 --> 05:40:54.540
that would make this a lot easier.

05:40:55.540 --> 05:40:56.540
Water breathing?

05:40:56.540 --> 05:40:57.540
Where?

05:40:57.540 --> 05:40:58.540
Water breathing!

05:40:58.540 --> 05:41:00.540
Oh, hold 15 seconds.

05:41:00.540 --> 05:41:01.540
Oh, you're too kind.

05:41:01.540 --> 05:41:02.540
You're too kind.

05:41:06.540 --> 05:41:07.540
Oh!

05:41:07.540 --> 05:41:08.540
Oh!

05:41:08.540 --> 05:41:09.540
Oh!

05:41:09.540 --> 05:41:10.540
Oh!

05:41:10.540 --> 05:41:11.540
Oh!

05:41:11.540 --> 05:41:12.540
Oh!

05:41:12.540 --> 05:41:13.540
Fucking...

05:41:17.540 --> 05:41:18.540
Oh, I'm getting current.

05:41:18.540 --> 05:41:20.540
I'm getting drafted away by the current.

05:41:21.540 --> 05:41:22.540
Okay, fuck that.

05:41:22.540 --> 05:41:24.540
Right, we're doing new one.

05:41:24.540 --> 05:41:25.540
Stop! Current, stop!

05:41:25.540 --> 05:41:26.540
I can't breathe.

05:41:31.540 --> 05:41:32.540
Oh!

05:41:40.540 --> 05:41:41.540
Ah!

05:41:41.540 --> 05:41:43.540
I've only got 10 lock picks.

05:41:43.540 --> 05:41:45.540
Gonna be easy on me.

05:41:45.540 --> 05:41:46.540
I'm gonna need to buy some more.

05:41:48.540 --> 05:41:49.540
No!

05:41:49.540 --> 05:41:50.540
Less?

05:41:53.540 --> 05:41:54.540
I'm like...

05:41:57.540 --> 05:41:59.540
Is that less or is that more?

05:42:02.540 --> 05:42:03.540
Oh!

05:42:05.540 --> 05:42:06.540
Gimme that!

05:42:06.540 --> 05:42:08.540
Stupid bastard!

05:42:08.540 --> 05:42:09.540
You're a quill.

05:42:09.540 --> 05:42:10.540
Right.

05:42:10.540 --> 05:42:11.540
We did it.

05:42:11.540 --> 05:42:12.540
Oh my god, that took a while.

05:42:14.540 --> 05:42:16.540
Just get Volsang

05:42:16.540 --> 05:42:17.540
and forget about that.

05:42:17.540 --> 05:42:18.540
What's Volsang?

05:42:19.540 --> 05:42:20.540
She's got it.

05:42:20.540 --> 05:42:22.540
If she can open the box, literally.

05:42:22.540 --> 05:42:23.540
What's inside the box?

05:42:23.540 --> 05:42:25.540
That fucking quill!

05:42:26.540 --> 05:42:27.540
You did it.

05:42:27.540 --> 05:42:29.540
You're the first person in history to buy lock picks.

05:42:29.540 --> 05:42:30.540
They're so common.

05:42:30.540 --> 05:42:32.540
I don't want to keep forgetting to fill it.

05:42:32.540 --> 05:42:33.540
Hi, do you want a quill?

05:42:36.540 --> 05:42:37.540
I found the quill.

05:42:44.540 --> 05:42:45.540
Yes.

05:42:48.540 --> 05:42:49.540
Okay.

05:42:50.540 --> 05:42:51.540
Oh, okay.

05:42:51.540 --> 05:42:52.540
Oh, that's Exile.

05:42:52.540 --> 05:42:53.540
That's not very nice.

05:42:53.540 --> 05:42:54.540
He's made his pals here.

05:42:55.540 --> 05:42:57.540
Do you want to reconsider Exile on someone?

05:42:57.540 --> 05:42:58.540
That's not very...

05:42:58.540 --> 05:42:59.540
That's not very nice.

05:42:59.540 --> 05:43:00.540
Have you heard of that?

05:43:00.540 --> 05:43:03.540
Have you heard how damaging that can be to someone's social life?

05:43:04.540 --> 05:43:06.540
Makes them feel like they're not a part of the community.

05:43:06.540 --> 05:43:08.540
Have to, you know, uproot and go elsewhere.

05:43:08.540 --> 05:43:09.540
Not nice.

05:43:09.540 --> 05:43:10.540
It's trying to suck at this guy room.

05:43:10.540 --> 05:43:11.540
I know.

05:43:12.540 --> 05:43:13.540
Eh, you.

05:43:13.540 --> 05:43:14.540
Come...

05:43:14.540 --> 05:43:15.540
Come here.

05:43:15.540 --> 05:43:17.540
I can't talk to him yet or he'll be aggressive.

05:43:17.540 --> 05:43:18.540
Like...

05:43:19.540 --> 05:43:20.540
You.

05:43:20.540 --> 05:43:21.540
Psst.

05:43:21.540 --> 05:43:22.540
Psst.

05:43:22.540 --> 05:43:23.540
Psst.

05:43:23.540 --> 05:43:24.540
Psst.

05:43:24.540 --> 05:43:25.540
Here.

05:43:25.540 --> 05:43:26.540
Over here.

05:43:26.540 --> 05:43:27.540
What?

05:43:27.540 --> 05:43:28.540
What?

05:43:28.540 --> 05:43:29.540
Or Big Vault.

05:43:29.540 --> 05:43:30.540
Sorry.

05:43:30.540 --> 05:43:31.540
Big Vault.

05:43:31.540 --> 05:43:32.540
Oh, oh, he's going to that gate.

05:43:32.540 --> 05:43:33.540
Hold on.

05:43:33.540 --> 05:43:35.540
If we're fast enough, if we're fast enough, we can go.

05:43:35.540 --> 05:43:37.540
We can go talk to him on the other side of that gate.

05:43:37.540 --> 05:43:38.540
Vault.

05:43:38.540 --> 05:43:39.540
Vault.

05:43:39.540 --> 05:43:40.540
Hold on.

05:43:40.540 --> 05:43:41.540
Vault.

05:43:41.540 --> 05:43:42.540
It's me.

05:43:42.540 --> 05:43:43.540
It's me.

05:43:43.540 --> 05:43:44.540
No, no, no.

05:43:44.540 --> 05:43:45.540
He's come back to the original position.

05:43:45.540 --> 05:43:46.540
No, Vault.

05:43:46.540 --> 05:43:47.540
Wait, Vault.

05:43:47.540 --> 05:43:48.540
Wait.

05:43:48.540 --> 05:43:49.540
Let me talk to you.

05:43:49.540 --> 05:43:50.540
I just want to talk to you.

05:43:50.540 --> 05:43:51.540
I just want to talk to you.

05:43:51.540 --> 05:43:52.540
I just want to talk to you.

05:43:52.540 --> 05:43:53.540
I just want to talk to you.

05:43:53.540 --> 05:43:54.540
Vault.

05:43:54.540 --> 05:43:55.540
Vault.

05:43:55.540 --> 05:43:56.540
Oh.

05:43:56.540 --> 05:43:57.540
I have something for you.

05:43:59.540 --> 05:44:00.540
Here.

05:44:00.540 --> 05:44:01.540
It's your debt with Maven.

05:44:01.540 --> 05:44:02.540
You're free.

05:44:13.540 --> 05:44:14.540
What are you doing?

05:44:14.540 --> 05:44:15.540
How's he added?

05:44:15.540 --> 05:44:17.540
Are you just coming out now?

05:44:17.540 --> 05:44:19.540
Oh, he is.

05:44:19.540 --> 05:44:20.540
Oh.

05:44:20.540 --> 05:44:21.540
Can't talk.

05:44:21.540 --> 05:44:22.540
I'm out of here.

05:44:22.540 --> 05:44:23.540
Okay.

05:44:23.540 --> 05:44:24.540
Thank you.

05:44:24.540 --> 05:44:25.540
Thank you very much.

05:44:25.540 --> 05:44:27.540
Can I just come in this way?

05:44:27.540 --> 05:44:28.540
Oh, it's barred.

05:44:28.540 --> 05:44:29.540
Wait.

05:44:29.540 --> 05:44:31.540
I need a bow and arrow.

05:44:31.540 --> 05:44:34.540
Or can I just hit this?

05:44:34.540 --> 05:44:35.540
Okay.

05:44:35.540 --> 05:44:36.540
No.

05:44:36.540 --> 05:44:38.540
You need a bow and arrow.

05:44:38.540 --> 05:44:40.540
I was being a bit...

05:44:40.540 --> 05:44:44.540
Let me just...

05:44:44.540 --> 05:44:45.540
Oh.

05:44:46.540 --> 05:44:47.540
Ta-da.

05:44:48.540 --> 05:44:50.540
That's how you get the ramp down.

05:44:50.540 --> 05:44:51.540
Super fuss.

05:44:51.540 --> 05:44:52.540
He's skipping tone.

05:44:52.540 --> 05:44:53.540
No reason.

05:44:59.540 --> 05:45:02.540
I just subbed to all the girls' accounts.

05:45:02.540 --> 05:45:03.540
Heck yeah, dude.

05:45:03.540 --> 05:45:06.540
We love supporting gen-mates out here.

05:45:09.540 --> 05:45:11.540
Oh, the whole linear.

05:45:11.540 --> 05:45:12.540
You animal.

05:45:12.540 --> 05:45:14.540
Literally finishing off the kill.

05:45:14.540 --> 05:45:20.540
She said, nah, I want to be the reason for death on the death certificate.

05:45:20.540 --> 05:45:22.540
Jeez, Louise girl.

05:45:23.540 --> 05:45:26.540
The bar is locked in place and cannot be opened.

05:45:26.540 --> 05:45:27.540
Okay.

05:45:28.540 --> 05:45:29.540
Any money?

05:45:29.540 --> 05:45:31.540
Garnet, I'll take you.

05:45:31.540 --> 05:45:34.540
I can sell it for some money.

05:45:34.540 --> 05:45:35.540
Statue of Debalah.

05:45:35.540 --> 05:45:36.540
How about that?

05:45:36.540 --> 05:45:37.540
Can I move that one?

05:45:37.540 --> 05:45:38.540
Nope.

05:45:38.540 --> 05:45:39.540
Can't move that one either.

05:45:39.540 --> 05:45:40.540
Okay.

05:45:40.540 --> 05:45:42.540
What's in this house then, I guess?

05:45:42.540 --> 05:45:44.540
Let's go F myself.

05:45:44.540 --> 05:45:45.540
Wait.

05:45:45.540 --> 05:45:46.540
What?

05:45:46.540 --> 05:45:48.540
This isn't the end.

05:45:48.540 --> 05:45:49.540
Hold on.

05:45:54.540 --> 05:45:55.540
Right here?

05:45:55.540 --> 05:45:56.540
Ah.

05:45:56.540 --> 05:45:57.540
Yeah.

05:45:57.540 --> 05:45:59.540
Right, I'm not touching anything else.

05:45:59.540 --> 05:46:02.540
Suspicious clothes.

05:46:02.540 --> 05:46:05.540
Honestly, I wouldn't have figured that out more.

05:46:05.540 --> 05:46:08.540
If we ended up a little cheeky here in the portion.

05:46:09.540 --> 05:46:10.540
What's this?

05:46:11.540 --> 05:46:13.540
I have no idea what this is.

05:46:13.540 --> 05:46:14.540
That looks like a trap.

05:46:14.540 --> 05:46:15.540
Lydia.

05:46:15.540 --> 05:46:16.540
Lydia.

05:46:16.540 --> 05:46:17.540
Lydia, stop standing on stuff, Lydia.

05:46:17.540 --> 05:46:18.540
Lydia.

05:46:18.540 --> 05:46:19.540
Lydia.

05:46:20.540 --> 05:46:22.540
I'm getting sliced in days.

05:46:22.540 --> 05:46:23.540
Hold on.

05:46:25.540 --> 05:46:28.540
I'm getting absolutely chopped up.

05:46:28.540 --> 05:46:30.540
Oh, and there's poison doors.

05:46:30.540 --> 05:46:31.540
Mine.

05:46:31.540 --> 05:46:32.540
Goodness.

05:46:32.540 --> 05:46:33.540
You need to relax.

05:46:34.540 --> 05:46:35.540
Oh my God.

05:46:35.540 --> 05:46:36.540
Money.

05:46:37.540 --> 05:46:38.540
Okay, I've got that.

05:46:38.540 --> 05:46:39.540
What's this?

05:46:39.540 --> 05:46:40.540
Eh.

05:46:41.540 --> 05:46:42.540
What even?

05:46:43.540 --> 05:46:44.540
What is this book?

05:46:44.540 --> 05:46:45.540
I have curiosity.

05:46:45.540 --> 05:46:47.540
What's the contents of this book?

05:46:47.540 --> 05:46:49.540
I've never actually written it.

05:46:53.540 --> 05:46:54.540
Lift her tail.

05:46:54.540 --> 05:46:56.540
Certainly not, kind sir.

05:46:56.540 --> 05:46:58.540
I am here to clean your chambers.

05:46:58.540 --> 05:47:00.540
Is that all you have come?

05:47:00.540 --> 05:47:02.540
Is that all you have come here for?

05:47:02.540 --> 05:47:04.540
Little one, my chambers.

05:47:04.540 --> 05:47:06.540
I have no idea what it is you imply, master.

05:47:06.540 --> 05:47:08.540
I am but a poor Argonian maid.

05:47:08.540 --> 05:47:09.540
Bro, what?

05:47:09.540 --> 05:47:11.540
So you are my dumpling.

05:47:11.540 --> 05:47:12.540
And a good one at that.

05:47:12.540 --> 05:47:14.540
Such strong legs and shapely tail.

05:47:14.540 --> 05:47:15.540
You embarrass me, sir.

05:47:15.540 --> 05:47:17.540
Fear not, you're safe with me.

05:47:17.540 --> 05:47:19.540
I must finish my cleaning, sir.

05:47:19.540 --> 05:47:21.540
The mistress will have my head if I do not.

05:47:21.540 --> 05:47:22.540
Cleaning, eh?

05:47:22.540 --> 05:47:24.540
I have something for you right here.

05:47:25.540 --> 05:47:27.540
Polish my spear.

05:47:27.540 --> 05:47:28.540
But it is huge.

05:47:28.540 --> 05:47:30.540
It could take me all night.

05:47:30.540 --> 05:47:31.540
Plenty of time.

05:47:31.540 --> 05:47:32.540
My sweet plenty.

05:47:34.540 --> 05:47:37.540
I've never fucking read that.

05:47:38.540 --> 05:47:41.540
Oh my god, that's hilarious.

05:47:43.540 --> 05:47:44.540
Many thanks.

05:47:44.540 --> 05:47:47.540
Not certain how you managed to get your hands on this item we discussed,

05:47:47.540 --> 05:47:48.540
but I'm more than pleased.

05:47:48.540 --> 05:47:53.540
I thought you'd simply wait until transported to Castle Diver to its final destination

05:47:53.540 --> 05:47:56.540
but according to what I've heard, it vanished right from their armory.

05:47:56.540 --> 05:47:58.540
I wish I knew how you were able to slip by the guards,

05:47:58.540 --> 05:48:01.540
bypass the porticolas,

05:48:01.540 --> 05:48:05.540
unlock the armory door and break in at the door of a puzzle-locked chest.

05:48:05.540 --> 05:48:07.540
You need to teach me that little trick sometime.

05:48:07.540 --> 05:48:09.540
I've left your cut in the usual drop spot

05:48:09.540 --> 05:48:11.540
and might have another drop where you soon are.

05:48:13.540 --> 05:48:15.540
There's three more books of it.

05:48:15.540 --> 05:48:17.540
Oh my god, but I've never...

05:48:17.540 --> 05:48:18.540
I knew the books existed.

05:48:18.540 --> 05:48:19.540
Wait, what am I doing?

05:48:20.540 --> 05:48:21.540
Expert!

05:48:24.540 --> 05:48:26.540
Can we do it?

05:48:27.540 --> 05:48:34.540
Okay, but we have it.

05:48:36.540 --> 05:48:37.540
Easy.

05:48:39.540 --> 05:48:40.540
Easy.

05:48:40.540 --> 05:48:42.540
Okay, a bit more, I think.

05:48:42.540 --> 05:48:44.540
Or maybe it was left, I don't know.

05:48:45.540 --> 05:48:47.540
Okay, maybe it's left, you know that.

05:48:49.540 --> 05:48:50.540
Easy.

05:48:52.540 --> 05:48:54.540
Easy, I'm getting nervous.

05:48:55.540 --> 05:48:56.540
Easy.

05:49:02.540 --> 05:49:04.540
Alright, we got childrens.

05:49:04.540 --> 05:49:05.540
I'll take childrens.

05:49:05.540 --> 05:49:06.540
Not a bother at all.

05:49:07.540 --> 05:49:09.540
Not a bother at all.

05:49:12.540 --> 05:49:14.540
The rat weevils, yes.

05:49:15.540 --> 05:49:16.540
Let's go.

05:49:16.540 --> 05:49:17.540
Let's go.

05:49:23.540 --> 05:49:26.540
I don't remember what way to go.

05:49:27.540 --> 05:49:28.540
Is it this one?

05:49:31.540 --> 05:49:33.540
Oh no, this is if you want Dragonborn.

05:49:35.540 --> 05:49:36.540
Can you stop attacking me?

05:49:37.540 --> 05:49:38.540
Whoa, your bull!

05:49:39.540 --> 05:49:40.540
It's an imperial bull.

05:49:41.540 --> 05:49:45.540
I think an imperial bull is better than what I've got right now.

05:49:46.540 --> 05:49:49.540
Although mine does have burn damage, so...

05:49:50.540 --> 05:49:53.540
I wish YouTube had other emotes, I know.

05:49:54.540 --> 05:49:59.540
YouTube is like very slowly catching up to the appeal of...

05:50:01.540 --> 05:50:03.540
I'm not doing any more lockpicking, I don't know.

05:50:03.540 --> 05:50:07.540
YouTube is very slowly catching up to what the appeal of Twitch is.

05:50:07.540 --> 05:50:11.540
To the point where it is going to take over Twitch, I'm sorry.

05:50:11.540 --> 05:50:12.540
It just is.

05:50:13.540 --> 05:50:15.540
Why did I drop down?

05:50:15.540 --> 05:50:18.540
I've just added so much time to this travel.

05:50:21.540 --> 05:50:28.540
I did not recall how long it takes to place Skyrim.

05:50:29.540 --> 05:50:32.540
We're literally not even finished one questline yet.

05:50:36.540 --> 05:50:38.540
Tear him up, Lydia!

05:50:40.540 --> 05:50:41.540
Okay, there we go.

05:50:41.540 --> 05:50:42.540
Emm...

05:50:44.540 --> 05:50:45.540
Emmys rats!

05:50:46.540 --> 05:50:48.540
I'm so confused, where did that come from?

05:50:48.540 --> 05:50:49.540
I dropped down there.

05:50:52.540 --> 05:50:53.540
Okay.

05:50:53.540 --> 05:50:54.540
Ugh, there you go.

05:50:55.540 --> 05:50:59.540
Channel emotes soon, channel emotes literally less than 24 hours, have fun.

05:51:00.540 --> 05:51:03.540
Am I almost supposed to speak to Brinyo?

05:51:04.540 --> 05:51:08.540
You know what, if I had that selected, that probably would have gone a lot faster than what I just did there.

05:51:11.540 --> 05:51:17.540
Underestimating the 1000 plus hours game, but literally I was like, right, we'll do the Thieves Guild, we'll do Dark Brotherhood.

05:51:17.540 --> 05:51:23.540
We're literally six hours into this stream, I've less than six hours and I've not even finished Thieves.

05:51:24.540 --> 05:51:25.540
Oh, sorry, sorry.

05:51:25.540 --> 05:51:27.540
I got a bit excited there, I apologize.

05:51:35.540 --> 05:51:36.540
Okay, let's do that.

05:51:36.540 --> 05:51:37.540
How much?

05:51:38.540 --> 05:51:39.540
How many?

05:51:39.540 --> 05:51:40.540
How much heavy am I?

05:51:40.540 --> 05:51:43.540
Curry, wait, it's 2, 18 out of 3, 30.

05:51:43.540 --> 05:51:46.540
That'll do, I need like 100 stuff.

05:51:46.540 --> 05:51:47.540
Hi, Carlaya.

05:51:49.540 --> 05:51:50.540
How long do we have?

05:51:50.540 --> 05:51:52.540
Yeah, less than six hours because of this.

05:51:54.540 --> 05:51:56.540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:52:00.540 --> 05:52:03.540
No, the wise two people inviting me to talk, there's too many people.

05:52:07.540 --> 05:52:10.540
Wait, so do you do every sequel?

05:52:10.540 --> 05:52:11.540
No.

05:52:11.540 --> 05:52:21.540
I was just going to do Thieves Guild, Black, Assassins, what, that's not what they're called.

05:52:22.540 --> 05:52:30.540
The Dark Brotherhood, and then the Vampire, and then the main quest, and I've done nothing yet, so I don't think it's happening.

05:52:33.540 --> 05:52:35.540
Dark Brotherhood, yes.

05:52:37.540 --> 05:52:39.540
Hi, Brainyo, smashes into wall.

05:52:44.540 --> 05:52:50.540
The trinity of streams on YouTube, YouTube shorts and recycled clips with 10 minutes highlights on the same platform.

05:52:51.540 --> 05:52:54.540
And also just a cheat for exposure.

05:52:54.540 --> 05:53:00.540
Yeah, like Twitch is exposed, it's very interesting to see breakdowns on either website.

05:53:01.540 --> 05:53:02.540
Like, I've just...

05:53:03.540 --> 05:53:05.540
Meet Carlaya at the Sanding Zone.

05:53:05.540 --> 05:53:07.540
Okay, we're about to become a nightingale.

05:53:07.540 --> 05:53:15.540
I know I've literally skipped through all the dialogue, so for anyone who hasn't consumed Skyrim and is listening in at home, I apologize greatly.

05:53:16.540 --> 05:53:24.540
I can just give you the TLDR, more than happy to provide such a thing for you.

05:53:24.540 --> 05:53:26.540
How the heck do I get out of this area?

05:53:30.540 --> 05:53:33.540
I'll just go out of the docks, how about that?

05:53:33.540 --> 05:53:35.540
I don't think you can jump over.

05:53:37.540 --> 05:53:39.540
If you haven't played Skyrim, go play Skyrim.

05:53:41.540 --> 05:53:43.540
Mind yourself.

05:53:43.540 --> 05:53:46.540
I'd be a rifting guard, I'd be like, yeah.

05:53:48.540 --> 05:53:50.540
Don't be causing trouble.

05:53:54.540 --> 05:53:55.540
Hi, Maul.

05:53:59.540 --> 05:54:01.540
Any news involving the Dark Brotherhood?

05:54:04.540 --> 05:54:09.540
Oh, that's the other... that's the Brotherhood quest.

05:54:09.540 --> 05:54:15.540
Well, that was lucky we talked to him to get that, because we'd probably just have to kill Grelok the kind.

05:54:16.540 --> 05:54:18.540
And she's actually not very kind.

05:54:18.540 --> 05:54:19.540
What's this?

05:54:19.540 --> 05:54:20.540
Oh, it's a clay deposit.

05:54:23.540 --> 05:54:25.540
The T-Skilled quest line is mostly yapping at this point.

05:54:25.540 --> 05:54:30.540
Honestly, we're about to become nightingales, and it's about to be yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.

05:54:30.540 --> 05:54:32.540
I thought I was a good yapper.

05:54:32.540 --> 05:54:34.540
Yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.

05:54:34.540 --> 05:54:37.540
Hello, hello!

05:54:37.540 --> 05:54:39.540
I'm glad you're here.

05:54:39.540 --> 05:54:42.540
What's the significance of this place?

05:54:42.540 --> 05:54:45.540
This is the headquarters of the nightingales.

05:54:45.540 --> 05:54:48.540
Cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.

05:54:48.540 --> 05:54:49.540
See?

05:54:49.540 --> 05:54:52.540
We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.

05:54:52.540 --> 05:54:53.540
Okay, yeah.

05:54:53.540 --> 05:54:55.540
What kind of an edge?

05:54:57.540 --> 05:54:59.540
What kind of an edge?

05:54:59.540 --> 05:55:03.540
If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.

05:55:03.540 --> 05:55:04.540
Yeah.

05:55:07.540 --> 05:55:10.540
Yeah, let's edge this way, please.

05:55:11.540 --> 05:55:13.540
Oh, look at them steps.

05:55:13.540 --> 05:55:15.540
Look at that bow, though.

05:55:15.540 --> 05:55:17.540
I actually want that bow.

05:55:17.540 --> 05:55:21.540
Look at the satchel that the arrow's going.

05:55:21.540 --> 05:55:25.540
I like how they're coded to look like what the arrow is.

05:55:25.540 --> 05:55:26.540
Very nice.

05:55:26.540 --> 05:55:28.540
Very, very nice.

05:55:30.540 --> 05:55:33.540
I heard about this place when I joined the gale,

05:55:33.540 --> 05:55:35.540
but I never believed it existed.

05:55:35.540 --> 05:55:37.540
I never believed it existed?

05:55:38.540 --> 05:55:40.540
I took enough and I'm back.

05:55:40.540 --> 05:55:42.540
Are you surprised I'm still on?

05:55:42.540 --> 05:55:46.540
Um, is Emi's room in today?

05:55:46.540 --> 05:55:47.540
Emi?

05:55:47.540 --> 05:55:48.540
Or is it?

05:55:48.540 --> 05:55:51.540
No, Emi should already be on.

05:55:51.540 --> 05:55:56.540
Azura should be coming online in two minutes.

05:55:56.540 --> 05:55:59.540
If I have my times correct.

05:56:02.540 --> 05:56:04.540
Emi's off today.

05:56:05.540 --> 05:56:07.540
Just Sheevee and Mersey.

05:56:07.540 --> 05:56:08.540
So Mersey's on at one.

05:56:08.540 --> 05:56:09.540
Right.

05:56:09.540 --> 05:56:11.540
We'll redirect into Mersey.

05:56:11.540 --> 05:56:12.540
Deal?

05:56:12.540 --> 05:56:14.540
I'll make you a deal.

05:56:14.540 --> 05:56:16.540
We'll redirect into Mersey.

05:56:19.540 --> 05:56:23.540
Yeah, but we're in the nightingales like Robin Hood or something?

05:56:23.540 --> 05:56:28.540
I, the first time I did this,

05:56:28.540 --> 05:56:30.540
like the nightingale quest,

05:56:30.540 --> 05:56:33.540
I was in love with Lady Luck.

05:56:33.540 --> 05:56:35.540
I absolutely just...

05:56:35.540 --> 05:56:38.540
Ow, that was very loud in my ear.

05:56:38.540 --> 05:56:40.540
Hopefully that wasn't too loud in your ear.

05:56:40.540 --> 05:56:47.540
I just absolutely and truly adored the like,

05:56:47.540 --> 05:56:48.540
plot.

05:56:48.540 --> 05:56:53.540
Oh, I like so cool.

05:56:53.540 --> 05:56:57.540
I just look so amazing and awesome.

05:56:57.540 --> 05:56:58.540
Everything.

05:56:58.540 --> 05:57:00.540
I am ready for the oath.

05:57:00.540 --> 05:57:03.540
Now you go get changed.

05:57:03.540 --> 05:57:05.540
Best looking armor in the game.

05:57:05.540 --> 05:57:08.540
Honestly, this armor and Dark Brotherhood armor.

05:57:08.540 --> 05:57:12.540
Yeah, that's awesome.

05:57:12.540 --> 05:57:15.540
I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.

05:57:15.540 --> 05:57:18.540
I may have misheard you, but Mersey is in three hours.

05:57:18.540 --> 05:57:19.540
No one.

05:57:19.540 --> 05:57:23.540
Yeah, no, Mersey comes online at one o'clock for me.

05:57:23.540 --> 05:57:25.540
One o'clock in the afternoon, yeah?

05:57:25.540 --> 05:57:28.540
That's when Mersey comes online for me.

05:57:28.540 --> 05:57:31.540
So Mersey's actually perfect for us.

05:57:31.540 --> 05:57:35.540
Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a nightingale.

05:57:35.540 --> 05:57:36.540
Whoa, that lass.

05:57:36.540 --> 05:57:38.540
I appreciate the armor.

05:57:38.540 --> 05:57:39.540
But becoming a nightingale?

05:57:39.540 --> 05:57:41.540
That was never discussed.

05:57:41.540 --> 05:57:48.540
To hold any oath of defeating Mersey, we must have Nocturnal at our backs.

05:57:48.540 --> 05:57:53.540
If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck.

05:57:53.540 --> 05:57:54.540
So dramatic.

05:57:54.540 --> 05:57:56.540
What sort of arrangement?

05:57:56.540 --> 05:57:58.540
I need to know the terms.

05:57:58.540 --> 05:58:00.540
What time did I start streaming?

05:58:00.540 --> 05:58:03.540
Oh, I started streaming, yeah?

05:58:03.540 --> 05:58:06.540
At 4 a.m., yeah?

05:58:06.540 --> 05:58:09.540
I started at 4 a.m.

05:58:09.540 --> 05:58:13.540
I started at 4 a.m.

05:58:13.540 --> 05:58:17.540
You never wondered why everyone's schedule has a cheeky time zone

05:58:17.540 --> 05:58:19.540
that no one uses?

05:58:19.540 --> 05:58:22.540
Because that's my time zone.

05:58:22.540 --> 05:58:24.540
If it means the end of Mersey Frey,

05:58:24.540 --> 05:58:26.540
you can count on those night hours.

05:58:26.540 --> 05:58:28.540
Yeah.

05:58:28.540 --> 05:58:30.540
Are you ready to transact the oath?

05:58:30.540 --> 05:58:32.540
Yes, I will become nightingale.

05:58:32.540 --> 05:58:35.540
Yes, I'm ready.

05:58:35.540 --> 05:58:38.540
Please stand on the western circle.

05:58:38.540 --> 05:58:41.540
Holy crap, 4 a.m.

05:58:41.540 --> 05:58:48.540
The reason why I stream so early is in case I need to do stuff during the day.

05:58:48.540 --> 05:58:53.540
Originally, it was either I stream at 4 a.m. or I stream at 10 a.m.

05:58:53.540 --> 05:58:57.540
But the problem is, if I stream at 10 a.m., the day is over

05:58:57.540 --> 05:59:00.540
by the time I finish my endurance streams.

05:59:00.540 --> 05:59:05.540
So I wouldn't be able to do doctor's appointments if I need to make an appointment.

05:59:05.540 --> 05:59:08.540
Lydia, you're going to ruin this so much.

05:59:08.540 --> 05:59:11.540
Please stand elsewhere.

05:59:11.540 --> 05:59:13.540
Or just go...

05:59:13.540 --> 05:59:16.540
Lydia, you're going to ruin this scene so much.

05:59:16.540 --> 05:59:18.540
I'm not being funny.

05:59:18.540 --> 05:59:22.540
Come here, Lydia. You're going to ruin the awesomeness of this scene.

05:59:22.540 --> 05:59:24.540
Lydia.

05:59:24.540 --> 05:59:26.540
Wait here.

05:59:26.540 --> 05:59:29.540
Thank you. There's such a beautiful cinematic coming up

05:59:29.540 --> 05:59:31.540
and they don't know what it is yet.

05:59:31.540 --> 05:59:33.540
Just let it happen.

05:59:34.540 --> 05:59:36.540
Oh, not Lydia standing in the corner, right?

05:59:36.540 --> 05:59:38.540
Just don't look at her. Don't acknowledge her, okay?

05:59:38.540 --> 05:59:41.540
She's like a dinosaur.

05:59:41.540 --> 05:59:44.540
Alright, let's enjoy this because this is actually pretty cool.

06:00:03.540 --> 06:00:07.540
What could you possibly offer me now?

06:00:07.540 --> 06:00:11.540
I have two others that wish to transact the earth

06:00:11.540 --> 06:00:14.540
to serve you both in life and in death.

06:00:14.540 --> 06:00:16.540
You surprise me, Caroline.

06:00:16.540 --> 06:00:20.540
This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.

06:00:20.540 --> 06:00:22.540
In my favor?

06:00:22.540 --> 06:00:27.540
My appetite for mercy tomorrow succeeds my craving for wealth and grace.

06:00:27.540 --> 06:00:31.540
Revenge. How interesting.

06:00:31.540 --> 06:00:33.540
Very well.

06:00:33.540 --> 06:00:35.540
The conditions are acceptable.

06:00:35.540 --> 06:00:37.540
You may proceed.

06:00:37.540 --> 06:00:41.540
Lady Nocturne, we accept your terms.

06:00:41.540 --> 06:00:43.540
I ain't saying none of this.

06:00:43.540 --> 06:00:47.540
She sells to you as both your avengers and your sentinels.

06:00:47.540 --> 06:00:50.540
We will honor our agreement in this life and the next

06:00:50.540 --> 06:00:53.540
until the conditions have been met.

06:00:53.540 --> 06:00:57.540
Very well. I name your entrance night and day

06:00:57.540 --> 06:01:01.540
and I restore your status to the same, Caroline.

06:01:01.540 --> 06:01:05.540
And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain

06:01:05.540 --> 06:01:08.540
from disappointing me.

06:01:12.540 --> 06:01:15.540
Wait, we don't get to see her?

06:01:15.540 --> 06:01:17.540
I didn't see her.

06:01:17.540 --> 06:01:19.540
Okay, normal. I thought we got to see her.

06:01:19.540 --> 06:01:21.540
I guess it's with the next cinematic.

06:01:21.540 --> 06:01:23.540
I don't know. What do you mean we?

06:01:23.540 --> 06:01:26.540
It's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you.

06:01:26.540 --> 06:01:29.540
Mercy's true crime.

06:01:29.540 --> 06:01:31.540
Well, he's done more.

06:01:31.540 --> 06:01:34.540
Mercy was able to unlock the guilt vault without two keys

06:01:34.540 --> 06:01:36.540
because of what he stole from the twilight sepulchre.

06:01:36.540 --> 06:01:38.540
That's Scaly key.

06:01:38.540 --> 06:01:41.540
By doing this, he's compromised our time to return

06:01:41.540 --> 06:01:45.540
and in essence caused our luck to run dry.

06:01:45.540 --> 06:01:48.540
So the key doesn't lock any doors.

06:01:48.540 --> 06:01:52.540
But the key isn't only restricted to physical barriers.

06:01:52.540 --> 06:01:55.540
All of us possess untapped abilities.

06:01:55.540 --> 06:01:59.540
The potential to upgrade power is securely sealed within our minds.

06:01:59.540 --> 06:02:02.540
Once you realize the key can access these traits,

06:02:02.540 --> 06:02:06.540
the potential becomes limitless.

06:02:06.540 --> 06:02:10.540
The three sounds like no one should possess it.

06:02:10.540 --> 06:02:12.540
Good. Then you understand why this is a...

06:02:12.540 --> 06:02:16.540
It's too much power for one human to have.

06:02:16.540 --> 06:02:19.540
If the key isn't returned to its lock in the twilight sepulchre...

06:02:19.540 --> 06:02:21.540
We see her when we return the key.

06:02:21.540 --> 06:02:23.540
Yes, we will do that.

06:02:23.540 --> 06:02:27.540
As time passed, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence.

06:02:27.540 --> 06:02:29.540
And whether you know it or not,

06:02:29.540 --> 06:02:32.540
our uncanny luck defines our trade.

06:02:32.540 --> 06:02:36.540
First time I've ever set out to return something?

06:02:36.540 --> 06:02:38.540
In our line of work,

06:02:38.540 --> 06:02:43.540
it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner.

06:02:43.540 --> 06:02:45.540
Let's go then.

06:02:45.540 --> 06:02:47.540
Brynjolf has some business to discuss.

06:02:47.540 --> 06:02:49.540
I suggest you listen to him.

06:02:49.540 --> 06:02:51.540
All right, big Bryny. What's up?

06:02:51.540 --> 06:02:56.540
Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer.

06:02:56.540 --> 06:02:57.540
Uh-huh.

06:02:57.540 --> 06:02:59.540
The leadership of the guild.

06:02:59.540 --> 06:03:01.540
Oh my god, he's tapping his way through.

06:03:01.540 --> 06:03:03.540
Oh, he's doing a wee Irish dance for us.

06:03:03.540 --> 06:03:05.540
Oh, did-did-did-did-did-did-did.

06:03:05.540 --> 06:03:08.540
I and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.

06:03:08.540 --> 06:03:12.540
Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed.

06:03:12.540 --> 06:03:14.540
After we deal with him,

06:03:14.540 --> 06:03:18.540
all that remains is restoring the guild to its full strength.

06:03:18.540 --> 06:03:21.540
Wovens, have you used the skeleton key on someone's torso?

06:03:21.540 --> 06:03:23.540
What kind of question is that?

06:03:23.540 --> 06:03:25.540
I'll be back soon to have fun, yeah.

06:03:25.540 --> 06:03:28.540
Don't worry if you guys need to leave at any point.

06:03:28.540 --> 06:03:30.540
I'll be-I'll be at it.

06:03:32.540 --> 06:03:34.540
He is.

06:03:34.540 --> 06:03:36.540
He's tapping away there.

06:03:36.540 --> 06:03:38.540
Mm-hmm.

06:03:39.540 --> 06:03:41.540
Sorry, I'm trying to focus on your words,

06:03:41.540 --> 06:03:44.540
but your foot is moving and it's making me laugh.

06:03:45.540 --> 06:03:47.540
It's about time.

06:03:47.540 --> 06:03:50.540
No, it's not right. I don't know what to say.

06:03:54.540 --> 06:03:57.540
So don't get sentimental on me now, except...

06:04:02.540 --> 06:04:04.540
We'll handle the details.

06:04:04.540 --> 06:04:06.540
Ooh.

06:04:06.540 --> 06:04:08.540
We have quite the task ahead.

06:04:08.540 --> 06:04:11.540
Ah! Then let's get to it.

06:04:14.540 --> 06:04:17.540
What if we try to use the key on Strani?

06:04:17.540 --> 06:04:20.540
And implying you don't have free reign of me?

06:04:21.540 --> 06:04:24.540
Refling. You know me better than that.

06:04:26.540 --> 06:04:28.540
Yeah. Right.

06:04:30.540 --> 06:04:33.540
Lydia, I'm sorry that I put you in exile.

06:04:33.540 --> 06:04:35.540
Yes, follow me.

06:04:35.540 --> 06:04:37.540
My thing.

06:04:37.540 --> 06:04:41.540
I can't believe I made myself Lydia 2.0.

06:04:41.540 --> 06:04:43.540
Strani using the key on Refling?

06:04:46.540 --> 06:04:49.540
It's funny, you think you have any resistance against me.

06:04:58.540 --> 06:05:02.540
Roy is regaining his own foot in the way he tapped him.

06:05:04.540 --> 06:05:06.540
Sure.

06:05:07.540 --> 06:05:13.540
Oh yeah, becoming Guildmaster is bugged if you don't do the radiant quest first.

06:05:13.540 --> 06:05:16.540
Oh, I've always managed to do them after.

06:05:17.540 --> 06:05:19.540
I don't even know how they...

06:05:19.540 --> 06:05:23.540
Where the heck do you expect me to go?

06:05:24.540 --> 06:05:26.540
Eh, let's do that then.

06:05:28.540 --> 06:05:31.540
Strani considering you don't have many lockpicks,

06:05:31.540 --> 06:05:34.540
it may be beneficial just to hold on to it for a while.

06:05:34.540 --> 06:05:36.540
For a while, honestly though.

06:05:36.540 --> 06:05:39.540
Right, I need to go a little to the left.

06:05:39.540 --> 06:05:42.540
Not to be confused with the hit steam game.

06:05:42.540 --> 06:05:44.540
A little to the left.

06:05:44.540 --> 06:05:46.540
Let's get to it.

06:05:46.540 --> 06:05:51.540
If I can get up this hill then the enemies in that building won't be able to know me.

06:05:51.540 --> 06:05:53.540
Why would I resist Strani?

06:05:53.540 --> 06:05:55.540
Exactly, why would you?

06:05:55.540 --> 06:05:57.540
Anyone who puts up a fight gets...

06:05:57.540 --> 06:05:59.540
Twice as hard.

06:06:00.540 --> 06:06:05.540
Oh, hopefully you can figure out what the substitute was for that word.

06:06:05.540 --> 06:06:06.540
That's terrible.

06:06:06.540 --> 06:06:07.540
Wait, that's north.

06:06:07.540 --> 06:06:08.540
I'm going the wrong way.

06:06:08.540 --> 06:06:11.540
No, it's like along the waterfront.

06:06:14.540 --> 06:06:15.540
I would just...

06:06:15.540 --> 06:06:16.540
What?

06:06:16.540 --> 06:06:17.540
Sounds good.

06:06:17.540 --> 06:06:18.540
Hi, Strani.

06:06:18.540 --> 06:06:20.540
Dang, you're going hard into this game.

06:06:20.540 --> 06:06:23.540
We haven't even finished one questline yet.

06:06:23.540 --> 06:06:27.540
It's officially been six hours and I haven't finished one questline.

06:06:27.540 --> 06:06:32.540
I completely forgot how just humongous what this game is.

06:06:32.540 --> 06:06:37.540
It's extraordinary that I haven't actually...

06:06:37.540 --> 06:06:40.540
I'm about to get close to finishing the thieves.

06:06:40.540 --> 06:06:48.540
But even then, I'm not even going to truly finish them due to the reason of what.

06:06:48.540 --> 06:06:58.540
Because we're not even going to do those miscellaneous quests for the Thieves Guild to restore it to its final glory.

06:06:58.540 --> 06:07:01.540
Because...

06:07:01.540 --> 06:07:03.540
Do I take the lift here?

06:07:03.540 --> 06:07:05.540
No, I still don't take the lift.

06:07:05.540 --> 06:07:09.540
Keep the skeleton key for yourself.

06:07:09.540 --> 06:07:13.540
No, I'll be a good girl because I want to see a mummy nocturnal.

06:07:13.540 --> 06:07:15.540
I really like her design.

06:07:16.540 --> 06:07:19.540
I wouldn't mind incorporating...

06:07:19.540 --> 06:07:21.540
Well, I wouldn't mind.

06:07:21.540 --> 06:07:23.540
It's a very good design.

06:07:23.540 --> 06:07:25.540
Okay, the phone goes the same.

06:07:25.540 --> 06:07:27.540
How the heck did I get where I'm going?

06:07:27.540 --> 06:07:33.540
Literally every time I have to go somewhere, I just start spamming E on a hill and I'm like, is this where I'm supposed to go?

06:07:33.540 --> 06:07:36.540
No, I don't really have to walk up the hill yet.

06:07:36.540 --> 06:07:38.540
No, I don't have to walk up the hill.

06:07:38.540 --> 06:07:39.540
It's fine.

06:07:39.540 --> 06:07:40.540
It's fine.

06:07:40.540 --> 06:07:42.540
I saw that orbing.

06:07:42.540 --> 06:07:45.540
Now I'm not sure if I should resist or not.

06:07:45.540 --> 06:07:48.540
Either way, the outcome is clear.

06:07:48.540 --> 06:07:50.540
The hor...

06:07:50.540 --> 06:07:52.540
Oh, I thought it was the wind.

06:07:52.540 --> 06:07:53.540
It was rules.

06:07:53.540 --> 06:07:56.540
You don't need the key when you get a log pick into a hundred.

06:07:56.540 --> 06:07:58.540
Oh, I didn't know that.

06:07:58.540 --> 06:08:01.540
Does everything just become easy piece of lemon squeezy?

06:08:01.540 --> 06:08:04.540
Or do the log picks not break on a hundred or something?

06:08:04.540 --> 06:08:06.540
We're getting there.

06:08:06.540 --> 06:08:07.540
We can do it.

06:08:07.540 --> 06:08:08.540
I'm leaving us.

06:08:08.540 --> 06:08:11.540
We're just a little exhausted.

06:08:11.540 --> 06:08:14.540
I'm scarous.

06:08:14.540 --> 06:08:19.540
I thought for some reason, you said I'm scouse and I was like, right?

06:08:19.540 --> 06:08:21.540
Now what?

06:08:21.540 --> 06:08:24.540
Oh yeah, by the way, I'm scouse.

06:08:24.540 --> 06:08:27.540
I like the way you talk, Scottish lass.

06:08:27.540 --> 06:08:29.540
You know, right?

06:08:29.540 --> 06:08:31.540
Can I buy a cheeky Maccas?

06:08:31.540 --> 06:08:34.540
Wait, Maccas is Australian term.

06:08:34.540 --> 06:08:36.540
I can't believe it.

06:08:36.540 --> 06:08:38.540
We're boarding live here today.

06:08:38.540 --> 06:08:41.540
We are going to...

06:08:41.540 --> 06:08:44.540
This place is actually covered in bandits.

06:08:44.540 --> 06:08:48.540
I cannot for the life of me doing Australian accent.

06:08:48.540 --> 06:08:51.540
Who we are?

06:08:51.540 --> 06:08:52.540
Ray, what's this?

06:08:52.540 --> 06:08:53.540
A gate.

06:08:53.540 --> 06:08:54.540
Open the gate.

06:08:54.540 --> 06:08:55.540
Why not?

06:08:55.540 --> 06:08:58.540
That may come and help me with future...

06:08:58.540 --> 06:09:00.540
Go on a Maccas run, yeah?

06:09:00.540 --> 06:09:03.540
Get in void with me, yeah?

06:09:03.540 --> 06:09:05.540
Oh, I thought it was going to one shot you.

06:09:05.540 --> 06:09:07.540
I'm going to be honest.

06:09:07.540 --> 06:09:10.540
Yeah, you can beg for mercy when you're dead.

06:09:25.540 --> 06:09:26.540
Oh, I bonked him.

06:09:26.540 --> 06:09:27.540
Wait, give me that.

06:09:27.540 --> 06:09:29.540
I will destroy that.

06:09:29.540 --> 06:09:30.540
What is this?

06:09:30.540 --> 06:09:31.540
Can someone look this up?

06:09:31.540 --> 06:09:33.540
What I'm supposed to do with it?

06:09:33.540 --> 06:09:35.540
Flood, var, la, stone.

06:09:35.540 --> 06:09:37.540
I don't know what it is.

06:09:37.540 --> 06:09:40.540
Flood, var, la, stone.

06:09:40.540 --> 06:09:42.540
I've never seen them before.

06:09:42.540 --> 06:09:44.540
PC seems to have them.

06:09:44.540 --> 06:09:46.540
Xbox doesn't seem to have them.

06:09:46.540 --> 06:09:48.540
But mercy's in three hours.

06:09:48.540 --> 06:09:50.540
So you should have paid for that.

06:09:50.540 --> 06:09:51.540
Sorry, I got a lot.

06:09:51.540 --> 06:09:52.540
Go itch on my head.

06:09:54.540 --> 06:09:56.540
Speak to Carlaya.

06:09:58.540 --> 06:10:00.540
Ooh, they got...

06:10:00.540 --> 06:10:02.540
I... good luck.

06:10:02.540 --> 06:10:04.540
Egg's fair is a bit much.

06:10:04.540 --> 06:10:06.540
I've done that for souls.

06:10:07.540 --> 06:10:10.540
Right, the machines drop...

06:10:10.540 --> 06:10:11.540
Where's Lydia?

06:10:14.540 --> 06:10:16.540
Lydia, you do this all the time.

06:10:16.540 --> 06:10:19.540
There should be an enemy that pops out of here, yeah.

06:10:19.540 --> 06:10:21.540
Oh, that's right, I remember.

06:10:21.540 --> 06:10:24.540
These guys used to tweak me out.

06:10:24.540 --> 06:10:25.540
I'm actually...

06:10:25.540 --> 06:10:27.540
Tell you what, that was like really loud.

06:10:27.540 --> 06:10:30.540
I'm going to...

06:10:31.540 --> 06:10:33.540
Sentence, audio.

06:10:35.540 --> 06:10:37.540
Is that a bit better on your ears?

06:10:37.540 --> 06:10:40.540
I feel like whenever that happens, it's so loud.

06:10:43.540 --> 06:10:46.540
A new hand has touched the beak.

06:10:46.540 --> 06:10:48.540
Now, these do drop, yeah.

06:10:48.540 --> 06:10:50.540
That's exactly what I'm wanting.

06:10:50.540 --> 06:10:52.540
Like, tons of these soul gems.

06:10:57.540 --> 06:10:59.540
Oh, hold on.

06:10:59.540 --> 06:11:02.540
246, we're getting there, we're getting there.

06:11:04.540 --> 06:11:06.540
Yes, oh my goodness, this is what we want.

06:11:06.540 --> 06:11:09.540
Like, massive amounts of these soul gems.

06:11:09.540 --> 06:11:12.540
And then we can put, like, really good stuff on.

06:11:12.540 --> 06:11:15.540
There should be one that pops out of here.

06:11:17.540 --> 06:11:18.540
Yeah.

06:11:18.540 --> 06:11:19.540
Oh, I'm getting too good.

06:11:19.540 --> 06:11:22.540
I'm genuinely too good at this game, I'm sorry.

06:11:22.540 --> 06:11:25.540
The fact that I remember from childhood,

06:11:25.540 --> 06:11:28.540
where the enemies, like, come out...

06:11:28.540 --> 06:11:31.540
I'm just gonna show you how scared I was with the enemies.

06:11:34.540 --> 06:11:35.540
Come here.

06:11:35.540 --> 06:11:37.540
Okay, there we go.

06:11:37.540 --> 06:11:39.540
What was that, three to scavenge?

06:11:39.540 --> 06:11:41.540
Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it.

06:11:42.540 --> 06:11:44.540
I'll take it, I'll take anything.

06:11:44.540 --> 06:11:47.540
I'm happy with anything, any offerings I'll take.

06:11:47.540 --> 06:11:49.540
Oh, yeah!

06:11:51.540 --> 06:11:53.540
Is the enemy from here?

06:11:54.540 --> 06:11:55.540
Here.

06:11:56.540 --> 06:11:58.540
Oh, I heard that!

06:11:58.540 --> 06:12:01.540
I heard them, like, spidering up here.

06:12:06.540 --> 06:12:08.540
I can hear an enemy.

06:12:12.540 --> 06:12:14.540
Oh, I heard two, just one in there.

06:12:14.540 --> 06:12:16.540
But I need to go here.

06:12:18.540 --> 06:12:20.540
They're so tiny!

06:12:22.540 --> 06:12:24.540
They're so tiny!

06:12:26.540 --> 06:12:28.540
Oh, we are getting so many soldiers.

06:12:28.540 --> 06:12:31.540
This is exactly what I was needing, one of the runs in here.

06:12:31.540 --> 06:12:34.540
That spawn sneak is actually impressive.

06:12:37.540 --> 06:12:39.540
Ah!

06:12:44.540 --> 06:12:46.540
There, them.

06:12:47.540 --> 06:12:49.540
Okay, we can destroy that.

06:12:49.540 --> 06:12:51.540
Yeah, let's go.

06:12:52.540 --> 06:12:54.540
Alchemy.

06:12:57.540 --> 06:13:00.540
Yeah, yeah, I'll take the potions, let's go.

06:13:00.540 --> 06:13:03.540
Oh my god, I just jumped in real life.

06:13:03.540 --> 06:13:06.540
Because of that noise, of that latch.

06:13:08.540 --> 06:13:10.540
Oh, hello.

06:13:15.540 --> 06:13:17.540
Those bandits back there.

06:13:17.540 --> 06:13:19.540
Dot, dot, dot.

06:13:22.540 --> 06:13:25.540
We have to catch up to him before it's too late.

06:13:25.540 --> 06:13:29.540
I had the brap lever, literally jumped scared of me.

06:13:29.540 --> 06:13:33.540
I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us.

06:13:36.540 --> 06:13:39.540
Oh, he really got me there, didn't he?

06:13:39.540 --> 06:13:42.540
Look, there's so many, oh, soul gems.

06:13:42.540 --> 06:13:46.540
We love soul gems, soul gems, soul gems, soul gems.

06:13:46.540 --> 06:13:48.540
Oh, wait, is this the thing?

06:13:48.540 --> 06:13:51.540
I'm supposed to watch him, look, there he is.

06:13:51.540 --> 06:13:53.540
Look through the bars.

06:13:53.540 --> 06:13:55.540
I'm trying to, where is he?

06:13:55.540 --> 06:13:58.540
I'm pretty sure he pops out somewhere here.

06:13:58.540 --> 06:14:02.540
And this is a, this is an instance report.

06:14:02.540 --> 06:14:04.540
I've returned to continue watching.

06:14:04.540 --> 06:14:06.540
Where?

06:14:07.540 --> 06:14:09.540
Oh, there he is, there he is.

06:14:09.540 --> 06:14:11.540
That's Mercer, look, I'm crawling over.

06:14:11.540 --> 06:14:13.540
Look at this little cinematic.

06:14:14.540 --> 06:14:17.540
Oh, like, has he just expired right now?

06:14:21.540 --> 06:14:24.540
Oh, he didn't even move a sword.

06:14:27.540 --> 06:14:30.540
Eyelash, and we'll be ready for him.

06:14:31.540 --> 06:14:33.540
Man, FOV is so low.

06:14:33.540 --> 06:14:36.540
Do you get motion sickness? No.

06:14:38.540 --> 06:14:42.540
I'm very lucky, Mercer says she gets motion sickness playing video games.

06:14:42.540 --> 06:14:45.540
Not to be dramatic, but I think I would end it.

06:14:45.540 --> 06:14:48.540
Oh, God, I think there's farmer around here.

06:14:50.540 --> 06:14:51.540
What's this?

06:14:51.540 --> 06:14:53.540
Potions.

06:14:53.540 --> 06:14:57.540
Lutions and potions, I do love a good, I do love a good collection.

06:14:57.540 --> 06:15:00.540
Isn't there a farmer here? No?

06:15:00.540 --> 06:15:01.540
Empty?

06:15:01.540 --> 06:15:03.540
Oh, found him.

06:15:03.540 --> 06:15:04.540
Found him.

06:15:04.540 --> 06:15:08.540
Shit, and I have course of poison.

06:15:08.540 --> 06:15:10.540
What does he draw?

06:15:11.540 --> 06:15:14.540
Skibertail, nah, you're good.

06:15:14.540 --> 06:15:17.540
You, I want your soul gems.

06:15:18.540 --> 06:15:20.540
Who am I perishing?

06:15:20.540 --> 06:15:23.540
Why is Mercer such a poopy poopy?

06:15:34.540 --> 06:15:38.540
I just smacked myself into a wall at low health.

06:15:38.540 --> 06:15:40.540
Okay, that'll do.

06:15:40.540 --> 06:15:42.540
I think I'll be okay though.

06:15:42.540 --> 06:15:45.540
That was a jump scare and a half.

06:15:48.540 --> 06:15:51.540
Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

06:15:51.540 --> 06:15:54.540
Actually, it's probably really good that I have that on a panic,

06:15:54.540 --> 06:15:57.540
because it gets me away from the enemy really quickly.

06:15:58.540 --> 06:16:01.540
What the heck is this? Let's just stop.

06:16:03.540 --> 06:16:05.540
Oh, I need to go up.

06:16:06.540 --> 06:16:08.540
Excuse me?

06:16:11.540 --> 06:16:15.540
The freaking blades on the ground took all my expert!

06:16:16.540 --> 06:16:18.540
Are we having a troll?

06:16:26.540 --> 06:16:28.540
And where's the other lever?

06:16:29.540 --> 06:16:32.540
Excuse me, Brinyel, if you're just smacked me in the...

06:16:32.540 --> 06:16:34.540
That's the other lever there?

06:16:35.540 --> 06:16:37.540
Behind an egg spare?

06:16:38.540 --> 06:16:40.540
That can't be right.

06:16:40.540 --> 06:16:42.540
Surely not.

06:16:42.540 --> 06:16:44.540
But it is.

06:16:48.540 --> 06:16:51.540
That cannae be right, don't you have the skeleton key?

06:16:51.540 --> 06:16:53.540
No, we've not done that part.

06:16:57.540 --> 06:16:59.540
But that is it.

06:17:03.540 --> 06:17:06.540
Well, good thing I don't have a smurf it, but what?

06:17:06.540 --> 06:17:09.540
Wait. Oh, that's not the lever at all.

06:17:11.540 --> 06:17:13.540
Where the heck's the first lever?

06:17:16.540 --> 06:17:18.540
Is it here?

06:17:20.540 --> 06:17:23.540
Where's the second lever? Reveal yourself!

06:17:26.540 --> 06:17:28.540
What?

06:17:28.540 --> 06:17:31.540
There it is! Oh, it's adjacent to the other lever!

06:17:31.540 --> 06:17:33.540
Oh my god.

06:17:33.540 --> 06:17:35.540
Did I need to go all the way back again?

06:17:35.540 --> 06:17:38.540
Out my way, out my way, out my way, out my way.

06:17:38.540 --> 06:17:40.540
I'm not that fast.

06:17:40.540 --> 06:17:42.540
Hold on, hold on, I need to cheat.

06:17:42.540 --> 06:17:44.540
I'm not that fast.

06:17:44.540 --> 06:17:48.540
I was gonna say, putting something behind an expert level thing is wild.

06:17:53.540 --> 06:17:56.540
That wasn't it? Okay, I was gonna say, that has to be it.

06:17:56.540 --> 06:17:58.540
I refuse.

06:17:59.540 --> 06:18:01.540
A little cheeky chess.

06:18:03.540 --> 06:18:06.540
I'm being trolled by this game.

06:18:11.540 --> 06:18:14.540
I'm being through trolled.

06:18:14.540 --> 06:18:18.540
I'll destroy that, and then I can get more thingy.

06:18:18.540 --> 06:18:20.540
Are we there yet, bruv?

06:18:20.540 --> 06:18:23.540
I feel the same, we've literally not even finished one questline.

06:18:23.540 --> 06:18:25.540
I'm ready to make another cup of tea.

06:18:25.540 --> 06:18:30.540
Alright, you can stealth this area, but I'd rather just go for it.

06:18:30.540 --> 06:18:32.540
I'd rather just go for it.

06:18:41.540 --> 06:18:44.540
By the Pope, who's there? Identify yourself.

06:18:44.540 --> 06:18:49.540
There is a chess down below, but I'm not really fast right now.

06:18:49.540 --> 06:18:53.540
I want to finish one questline!

06:18:53.540 --> 06:18:56.540
One questline is all I have.

06:18:56.540 --> 06:18:59.540
Stop it, you're so stinky.

06:19:01.540 --> 06:19:03.540
Okay, hold on, you got something?

06:19:03.540 --> 06:19:04.540
Charmin's Key.

06:19:04.540 --> 06:19:07.540
What was this, a Charmin's Key, dude?

06:19:07.540 --> 06:19:09.540
Oh, is it for that?

06:19:09.540 --> 06:19:11.540
You know what, maybe this chest.

06:19:12.540 --> 06:19:13.540
No, it's not.

06:19:13.540 --> 06:19:15.540
Well, I'm not looting it then, go away.

06:19:15.540 --> 06:19:18.540
I don't know what the heck the Charmin's Key is for.

06:19:18.540 --> 06:19:21.540
Clap him, stinky lightning, honestly.

06:19:21.540 --> 06:19:22.540
How do you come back from that?

06:19:22.540 --> 06:19:25.540
Someone calls you stinky, you have no way of coming back, truly.

06:19:25.540 --> 06:19:28.540
It's over for you, just admit it.

06:19:28.540 --> 06:19:30.540
There's traps everywhere.

06:19:30.540 --> 06:19:33.540
Isn't there a massive Centaurian coming up?

06:19:33.540 --> 06:19:37.540
My brains just reminded me that there's a big enemy coming soon.

06:19:40.540 --> 06:19:42.540
What does that say?

06:19:42.540 --> 06:19:45.540
Bro, the game thinks I can read that?

06:19:45.540 --> 06:19:47.540
Mercer, it's backwards!

06:19:47.540 --> 06:19:50.540
Mercer is on the bottom.

06:19:56.540 --> 06:19:58.540
Why is that backwards?

06:19:58.540 --> 06:20:00.540
I can read Mercer as backwards.

06:20:00.540 --> 06:20:02.540
I don't mind the stinky.

06:20:02.540 --> 06:20:04.540
I don't mind the wires.

06:20:04.540 --> 06:20:05.540
What, an air?

06:20:05.540 --> 06:20:07.540
Why is it backwards?

06:20:09.540 --> 06:20:12.540
I'll take these scrolls because I can sell them for money.

06:20:18.540 --> 06:20:20.540
Let's go, let's go.

06:20:23.540 --> 06:20:26.540
This is very real.

06:20:29.540 --> 06:20:31.540
Oh, dear.

06:20:31.540 --> 06:20:36.540
Right, can you jump the Centaurian and not me, maybe?

06:20:36.540 --> 06:20:39.540
Oh, goodness, gravy.

06:20:39.540 --> 06:20:44.540
Some of these enemies are my right fellows.

06:20:44.540 --> 06:20:46.540
All my fellows.

06:20:49.540 --> 06:20:51.540
Oh, hold on.

06:20:51.540 --> 06:20:53.540
Hold on, right there you go.

06:20:55.540 --> 06:20:57.540
Alright, I should probably go to sleep.

06:20:57.540 --> 06:20:58.540
See you next time.

06:20:58.540 --> 06:20:59.540
Rest well, those who sleep.

06:20:59.540 --> 06:21:02.540
Please don't worry if you do need to go to sleep again.

06:21:02.540 --> 06:21:08.540
But the cheeky endurance stream, Mercer is going live in T-minus less than three hours.

06:21:08.540 --> 06:21:16.540
We're going to read Inter because my Skyrim escapades got cut short due to the fact that...

06:21:16.540 --> 06:21:21.540
Oh, I am moving so fast I am successfully avoiding all the traps laid out.

06:21:21.540 --> 06:21:26.540
Yes, I don't know why achievements aren't popping up.

06:21:26.540 --> 06:21:32.540
I'm literally using Xbox Game Pass right now, so it's kind of the...

06:21:32.540 --> 06:21:37.540
I'm not sure what the dealio is, but I'm quite happy just to play through the...

06:21:39.540 --> 06:21:43.540
Thingamabobber and tomorrow's monetization celebration.

06:21:46.540 --> 06:21:50.540
So I guess I can enjoy a more relaxed for my voice.

06:21:50.540 --> 06:21:52.540
Oh, come on.

06:21:54.540 --> 06:21:56.540
Oh, come on.

06:21:56.540 --> 06:21:58.540
Get a rest.

06:21:58.540 --> 06:21:59.540
Oh, I'm low health.

06:21:59.540 --> 06:22:00.540
Oh, I'm low health.

06:22:00.540 --> 06:22:02.540
I'm about to get altered by a spider.

06:22:02.540 --> 06:22:03.540
Hold on.

06:22:03.540 --> 06:22:05.540
Okay, there we go.

06:22:07.540 --> 06:22:09.540
Go around to read it.

06:22:10.540 --> 06:22:12.540
Go around it to read it.

06:22:12.540 --> 06:22:17.540
Oh, is there like another room that makes a lot more sense if there was like something behind it?

06:22:17.540 --> 06:22:21.540
Maybe I just ignored it and chose to be confused.

06:22:22.540 --> 06:22:23.540
Oh, give me that.

06:22:23.540 --> 06:22:25.540
Oh, orcishbowl and ice.

06:22:25.540 --> 06:22:27.540
Oh, and alchemy.

06:22:27.540 --> 06:22:29.540
Resurrect and restore my energy.

06:22:35.540 --> 06:22:38.540
Alchemyxing like a creature.

06:22:40.540 --> 06:22:43.540
Give me them juicy soul gems.

06:22:43.540 --> 06:22:44.540
That's all I want.

06:22:44.540 --> 06:22:45.540
That's all I crave.

06:22:45.540 --> 06:22:47.540
I just want soul gems.

06:22:49.540 --> 06:22:51.540
Oh, why don't I get one of you?

06:22:51.540 --> 06:22:52.540
No.

06:22:53.540 --> 06:22:54.540
Okay, okay, okay.

06:22:55.540 --> 06:22:57.540
You guys don't need to perfectly follow me.

06:22:57.540 --> 06:22:58.540
You do realize that, right?

06:22:58.540 --> 06:22:59.540
But we can do this.

06:23:00.540 --> 06:23:05.540
And we completely missed them because we alerted the enemies to our location.

06:23:08.540 --> 06:23:09.540
Okay, there we go.

06:23:09.540 --> 06:23:10.540
Oh my God, he's beat.

06:23:10.540 --> 06:23:11.540
They're jumping me.

06:23:13.540 --> 06:23:15.540
I'm actually beating that.

06:23:15.540 --> 06:23:18.540
God, they have so much venom.

06:23:19.540 --> 06:23:21.540
So much venom.

06:23:22.540 --> 06:23:24.540
Don't mind if I do it.

06:23:24.540 --> 06:23:27.540
Well, on earth where they do it, she be.

06:23:27.540 --> 06:23:29.540
What have you been doing in your dungeon?

06:23:29.540 --> 06:23:31.540
These last words?

06:23:31.540 --> 06:23:32.540
Oh my God, that's brutal.

06:23:32.540 --> 06:23:33.540
Hold on.

06:23:34.540 --> 06:23:36.540
These last words.

06:23:37.540 --> 06:23:39.540
Nobody thought they were real, but I've seen them.

06:23:39.540 --> 06:23:41.540
The eyes of the snow elves.

06:23:41.540 --> 06:23:43.540
The dwarves thought they looked...

06:23:43.540 --> 06:23:46.540
The dwarves thought they took them from the Thammer,

06:23:46.540 --> 06:23:47.540
but they themselves were fooled.

06:23:47.540 --> 06:23:49.540
A statue built in secrecy by the slaves.

06:23:50.540 --> 06:23:52.540
The eyes burn into you, and I see them.

06:23:52.540 --> 06:23:55.540
Even the Seraphot escaped through the collapsing tunnel,

06:23:55.540 --> 06:23:57.540
but he'll never escape what we've seen.

06:23:57.540 --> 06:24:00.540
Men will never believe him, and he'll be driven mad by the knowledge

06:24:00.540 --> 06:24:02.540
that he'll never see them again.

06:24:02.540 --> 06:24:05.540
But I may yet see them again before I die.

06:24:08.540 --> 06:24:10.540
Wow, that was strange.

06:24:11.540 --> 06:24:13.540
Strawny's a soul gem addict.

06:24:13.540 --> 06:24:16.540
Literally, they're like the most OP leveling up system.

06:24:16.540 --> 06:24:17.540
I'm just gonna blast through this area

06:24:17.540 --> 06:24:19.540
because there's a massive flamethrower, I think,

06:24:19.540 --> 06:24:21.540
or something.

06:24:26.540 --> 06:24:28.540
How am I detected if I'm around the corner?

06:24:28.540 --> 06:24:30.540
Why are you going for me?

06:24:30.540 --> 06:24:32.540
He's right there!

06:24:35.540 --> 06:24:37.540
Literally, right in...

06:24:37.540 --> 06:24:38.540
Actually, I just remembered,

06:24:38.540 --> 06:24:40.540
Mercer drops are really good.

06:24:40.540 --> 06:24:44.540
Two-handed sword, and we already got children.

06:24:44.540 --> 06:24:47.540
Yeah, that's right. Spank that rat on the fire.

06:24:52.540 --> 06:24:54.540
Oh, that's cool.

06:24:59.540 --> 06:25:00.540
Oh, I'm getting...

06:25:00.540 --> 06:25:03.540
Yeah, okay, I was gonna say I'm getting blasted by this.

06:25:04.540 --> 06:25:07.540
We may yet to see Strawny's eyes before we die.

06:25:10.540 --> 06:25:12.540
I might need to heal.

06:25:14.540 --> 06:25:16.540
Or I might get away with it.

06:25:20.540 --> 06:25:21.540
Ooh, we've been...

06:25:21.540 --> 06:25:22.540
Oh, I got detected.

06:25:22.540 --> 06:25:25.540
I keep going like, alright, I'll finally go sneak,

06:25:25.540 --> 06:25:29.540
and then I get detected because I'm not paying attention.

06:25:31.540 --> 06:25:33.540
Touch this.

06:25:33.540 --> 06:25:35.540
Eat this.

06:25:35.540 --> 06:25:37.540
Fun fact, the Dwemer nailed and scrolls are not doors,

06:25:37.540 --> 06:25:39.540
but actually, a type of elf.

06:25:39.540 --> 06:25:40.540
Two-handed.

06:25:40.540 --> 06:25:42.540
He's in a drill wheel there.

06:25:42.540 --> 06:25:44.540
Exactly.

06:25:44.540 --> 06:25:46.540
Imagine not being a drill wheel there.

06:25:46.540 --> 06:25:48.540
I can't relate.

06:25:48.540 --> 06:25:51.540
I've tried so many times to be an archer,

06:25:51.540 --> 06:25:53.540
but I just can't do it.

06:25:53.540 --> 06:25:55.540
Like, especially when the enemy come up in your face

06:25:55.540 --> 06:25:57.540
and you've got a bow and arrow,

06:25:57.540 --> 06:26:00.540
it's like, bro, it wouldn't actually be so fero-fero.

06:26:02.540 --> 06:26:05.540
I think that actually does more damage to the mother.

06:26:07.540 --> 06:26:10.540
Wait, can I get them to deal with the enemies?

06:26:10.540 --> 06:26:12.540
Oh my god, that's so cool.

06:26:12.540 --> 06:26:14.540
I can like, go through here.

06:26:14.540 --> 06:26:18.540
Is there like a treasure chest or something?

06:26:18.540 --> 06:26:20.540
Or is this just like a...

06:26:20.540 --> 06:26:22.540
Hurry up.

06:26:22.540 --> 06:26:24.540
Wait, that symbol.

06:26:24.540 --> 06:26:26.540
That means there's loot here?

06:26:26.540 --> 06:26:28.540
I don't see no loot.

06:26:28.540 --> 06:26:31.540
Or does it just mean that the thief's guild was here?

06:26:35.540 --> 06:26:37.540
Okay.

06:26:37.540 --> 06:26:39.540
I'm so confused.

06:26:40.540 --> 06:26:43.540
I feel like there may have been something I missed,

06:26:43.540 --> 06:26:45.540
but hey ho.

06:26:46.540 --> 06:26:48.540
Alright, let's get to it.

06:26:48.540 --> 06:26:50.540
Everybody get to it, to it.

06:26:50.540 --> 06:26:52.540
Let's get this party started.

06:26:52.540 --> 06:26:54.540
Let's get this bonus.

06:26:54.540 --> 06:26:56.540
Departed.

06:26:56.540 --> 06:26:58.540
Mercer was here.

06:26:58.540 --> 06:27:00.540
Shield 100 is perfectly viable, thank you very much.

06:27:00.540 --> 06:27:02.540
Probably.

06:27:02.540 --> 06:27:04.540
What do they hold?

06:27:04.540 --> 06:27:06.540
So they just kind of hold a lot of like, mix and stuff.

06:27:06.540 --> 06:27:08.540
That's interesting.

06:27:08.540 --> 06:27:11.540
They were more into like, the alchemy side of things.

06:27:11.540 --> 06:27:13.540
Master lot?

06:27:13.540 --> 06:27:15.540
Right, I'm not bothering.

06:27:15.540 --> 06:27:17.540
So it's on your bike.

06:27:20.540 --> 06:27:22.540
Hydration check.

06:27:28.540 --> 06:27:30.540
Oh.

06:27:30.540 --> 06:27:32.540
Wow.

06:27:36.540 --> 06:27:38.540
Wow.

06:27:46.540 --> 06:27:48.540
Such a shit.

06:27:52.540 --> 06:27:54.540
Yeah, give me the key, Mercer.

06:28:01.540 --> 06:28:03.540
The water's rising.

06:28:15.540 --> 06:28:17.540
I don't believe you, no.

06:28:17.540 --> 06:28:19.540
Turtle gates me, my new friend leaking.

06:28:30.540 --> 06:28:32.540
Oh.

06:28:32.540 --> 06:28:34.540
Dun dun dun.

06:28:34.540 --> 06:28:37.540
The difference is, I still have honor.

06:28:50.540 --> 06:28:54.540
If anyone falls, it'll be you, Mercer.

06:29:00.540 --> 06:29:02.540
Nightingale.

06:29:04.540 --> 06:29:09.540
I can't remember if this is hard or not.

06:29:09.540 --> 06:29:11.540
Oh no, he got wallets.

06:29:11.540 --> 06:29:13.540
Oh, he's got blood drain.

06:29:15.540 --> 06:29:17.540
Oh my god.

06:29:20.540 --> 06:29:21.540
Where is he?

06:29:21.540 --> 06:29:23.540
I can just see the red doll.

06:29:23.540 --> 06:29:25.540
I'm chasing the red doll.

06:29:25.540 --> 06:29:27.540
There he is.

06:29:27.540 --> 06:29:29.540
I found him.

06:29:30.540 --> 06:29:31.540
I got him.

06:29:31.540 --> 06:29:34.540
He's got, whoa, he's got like, yeah, I'll take all that.

06:29:34.540 --> 06:29:36.540
Shit, give me everything.

06:29:36.540 --> 06:29:39.540
Oh, I'm carrying too much to be able to run.

06:29:39.540 --> 06:29:41.540
Oh, sorry, hold on.

06:29:41.540 --> 06:29:46.540
Sorry, excuse me, just need to drop a few things that I don't need.

06:29:46.540 --> 06:29:50.540
I don't need an embalming tool, I can show you that much.

06:29:50.540 --> 06:29:54.540
Don't need random chunks of ore, that's fine.

06:29:54.540 --> 06:29:56.540
A what?

06:29:56.540 --> 06:29:58.540
It looks like a ship.

06:29:58.540 --> 06:30:00.540
Is that a tap?

06:30:00.540 --> 06:30:04.540
Yeah, don't need all these random miscellaneous things, that's fine.

06:30:04.540 --> 06:30:08.540
Ingredients that could probably eat all the little ones

06:30:08.540 --> 06:30:12.540
and clear up some side space stuff, I guess.

06:30:12.540 --> 06:30:15.540
Unknown, unknown.

06:30:15.540 --> 06:30:18.540
Sorry guys, I know the cave is collapsing, it's very important.

06:30:18.540 --> 06:30:22.540
I have a little taste test of all these ingredients, I assure you.

06:30:22.540 --> 06:30:25.540
Food, yeah, sure, let's just freaking load up.

06:30:25.540 --> 06:30:27.540
Am I light yet?

06:30:27.540 --> 06:30:30.540
No, I'm not light yet, holy crap.

06:30:30.540 --> 06:30:33.540
Okay, right, what do we not need?

06:30:33.540 --> 06:30:36.540
That does say 26, not gonna lie.

06:30:36.540 --> 06:30:39.540
Oh, I forgot to...

06:30:39.540 --> 06:30:41.540
That one's better.

06:30:41.540 --> 06:30:46.540
I don't want to drop it though, I feel like I can sell it for decent money, honestly.

06:30:46.540 --> 06:30:51.540
I guess we'll just drop that shit.

06:30:51.540 --> 06:30:54.540
Orcishbowl, 11.

06:30:54.540 --> 06:30:57.540
Please don't really give me much money.

06:30:57.540 --> 06:31:00.540
Okay, so don't panic.

06:31:00.540 --> 06:31:03.540
I know the cave is literally...

06:31:03.540 --> 06:31:08.540
Oh, I know the cave is like perishing and it's falling with war,

06:31:08.540 --> 06:31:12.540
but don't panic guys, everything is okay, alright?

06:31:12.540 --> 06:31:14.540
You just have to let it fill.

06:31:14.540 --> 06:31:18.540
Oh, oh he hit the quaw.

06:31:19.540 --> 06:31:22.540
Oh, are you guys okay? Do you guys need to breathe? No?

06:31:22.540 --> 06:31:25.540
No, you don't need to breathe? Okay, you don't have to.

06:31:25.540 --> 06:31:35.540
If you look above the head of the elf, you'll notice those rocks look very suspiciously movable.

06:31:35.540 --> 06:31:40.540
That's because they are, you have a keen eye, refling, you have a keen eye.

06:31:41.540 --> 06:31:47.540
I'm strong enough to taste test all the new alchemy ingredients,

06:31:47.540 --> 06:31:51.540
literally like trying to like release some of the weight in my inventory,

06:31:51.540 --> 06:31:57.540
and I'm like, hmm, yes, hmm, this moth wings though, what a delicacy.

06:31:57.540 --> 06:32:01.540
You just have to wait, unfortunately you can't like swim upwards,

06:32:01.540 --> 06:32:06.540
it doesn't do it the way you want it to, so it's a bit awkward.

06:32:06.540 --> 06:32:08.540
But yeah.

06:32:08.540 --> 06:32:12.540
I remember the first place where I was trying to like swim through these pipes,

06:32:12.540 --> 06:32:16.540
I was like, yes, the pipes, the pipes will save me.

06:32:16.540 --> 06:32:19.540
But it should do one big collapse.

06:32:19.540 --> 06:32:22.540
There you go.

06:32:22.540 --> 06:32:25.540
Pick it long enough, honestly.

06:32:25.540 --> 06:32:31.540
And then you just gotta wait until it gets high enough to get up there.

06:32:31.540 --> 06:32:34.540
To shift the weight in my body eats 50 cheese wheels.

06:32:34.540 --> 06:32:36.540
We are aquatic.

06:32:36.540 --> 06:32:38.540
Let me see some tools.

06:32:38.540 --> 06:32:41.540
Stopping to release, yes sir.

06:32:41.540 --> 06:32:45.540
But as faster you get out of that cave, the easier the game.

06:32:51.540 --> 06:32:56.540
I have completely forgotten how much the NPCs love to talk to you.

06:32:56.540 --> 06:32:58.540
No.

06:32:58.540 --> 06:33:00.540
Five years.

06:33:01.540 --> 06:33:04.540
No, Carlisle.

06:33:09.540 --> 06:33:11.540
It's not simple.

06:33:14.540 --> 06:33:17.540
Sepucar, I've never said sepucar.

06:33:20.540 --> 06:33:24.540
Are you ready to take a pilgrimage together?

06:33:26.540 --> 06:33:29.540
We can serve nocturnal in other ways.

06:33:29.540 --> 06:33:33.540
As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing.

06:33:33.540 --> 06:33:36.540
Then we'd best get started.

06:33:36.540 --> 06:33:40.540
We don't need it back if a thief's going to keep order while you're away.

06:33:40.540 --> 06:33:46.540
And I can't bear to face nocturnal, I don't need to protect the king.

06:33:46.540 --> 06:33:49.540
I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.

06:33:49.540 --> 06:33:52.540
Okay, we can do it alone. We're big boys and girls.

06:33:52.540 --> 06:33:54.540
Take this with you.

06:33:54.540 --> 06:33:56.540
Help within the walls of the sepucar.

06:33:56.540 --> 06:33:59.540
Oh, she gives me her bow.

06:34:03.540 --> 06:34:05.540
Oh.

06:34:07.540 --> 06:34:09.540
Okay, I'm actually hitting it.

06:34:09.540 --> 06:34:11.540
Sorry, last round. Okay, you can't talk to me.

06:34:11.540 --> 06:34:14.540
Ow, I just got blammed by that skull.

06:34:14.540 --> 06:34:16.540
I literally yanked the HP off me.

06:34:16.540 --> 06:34:19.540
Can we serve Strony in other ways?

06:34:19.540 --> 06:34:21.540
Absolutely.

06:34:22.540 --> 06:34:25.540
It depends what you're offering is to me.

06:34:27.540 --> 06:34:31.540
Aw, I've not even been a folk wreath yet.

06:34:33.540 --> 06:34:39.540
Actually, you know what? I need to destroy and enchant a few things to sell on.

06:34:39.540 --> 06:34:43.540
So I'm going to go do that now and it will free up a lot of inventory.

06:34:43.540 --> 06:34:46.540
Is Carlisle the same VA as Shadowheart?

06:34:46.540 --> 06:34:48.540
I cannot tell you that. I don't know.

06:34:48.540 --> 06:34:51.540
Well, there's gates such good reviews, though,

06:34:51.540 --> 06:34:54.540
that I'm really tempted to play it for the first time on stream,

06:34:54.540 --> 06:34:57.540
but I'm worried in case I'm so dumb I can't figure it out,

06:34:57.540 --> 06:35:01.540
but hopefully it's a full-proof game like anyone can just jump in on the fun.

06:35:01.540 --> 06:35:03.540
Right, this is what I want.

06:35:04.540 --> 06:35:08.540
Devouring, archery and potions.

06:35:08.540 --> 06:35:11.540
Everything else can be sold. You heard it here first.

06:35:14.540 --> 06:35:17.540
Did I even have a big gem?

06:35:18.540 --> 06:35:20.540
I do.

06:35:20.540 --> 06:35:23.540
Yes. Did I make it craft?

06:35:23.540 --> 06:35:25.540
Yes.

06:35:25.540 --> 06:35:27.540
That was bloody good shoe.

06:35:27.540 --> 06:35:29.540
That bloody good shoe.

06:35:29.540 --> 06:35:31.540
Right, where's that?

06:35:31.540 --> 06:35:36.540
So what? Just enchant random stuff now for the XP, I guess?

06:35:36.540 --> 06:35:39.540
Turn undead. Frost damage here, why not?

06:35:39.540 --> 06:35:41.540
Petty Soul Gem.

06:35:41.540 --> 06:35:44.540
Yeah, I'm just going to put Petty Soul Gem stuff on it.

06:35:45.540 --> 06:35:47.540
Uh-uh.

06:35:47.540 --> 06:35:50.540
And then I know I can sell everything in my inventory.

06:35:50.540 --> 06:35:53.540
God, look at the level up. It's so fast.

06:35:53.540 --> 06:35:56.540
The game is so forgiven.

06:36:01.540 --> 06:36:03.540
Just the noise.

06:36:04.540 --> 06:36:07.540
It's just constantly like...

06:36:08.540 --> 06:36:13.540
We'll put all of this stuff on and then we can get a pretty penny.

06:36:13.540 --> 06:36:15.540
Oh, we might be able to buy the home.

06:36:15.540 --> 06:36:18.540
We might be able to buy our home in Riften.

06:36:19.540 --> 06:36:23.540
And then we can have our little flower garden out in front.

06:36:24.540 --> 06:36:27.540
We can't get chickens though. Not yet.

06:36:27.540 --> 06:36:30.540
Baldur's Gate 3 is good and you can do whatever you want.

06:36:30.540 --> 06:36:32.540
It's not really wrong way of playing it.

06:36:32.540 --> 06:36:34.540
Baldur's Gate is really open and rewarding.

06:36:34.540 --> 06:36:36.540
I'm glad.

06:36:37.540 --> 06:36:39.540
Um...

06:36:41.540 --> 06:36:43.540
I can't figure it out.

06:36:43.540 --> 06:36:47.540
Also tells us, please backseat me. You'll be fine.

06:36:47.540 --> 06:36:52.540
Yeah, some folk really are so strongly like a little bit backseat gaming.

06:36:52.540 --> 06:36:56.540
I'm actually going to travel to Riften just to sell some stuff

06:36:56.540 --> 06:36:58.540
because my inventory is getting a bit too full.

06:36:58.540 --> 06:37:03.540
Now, as much as I like being full and, you know, a bandaid slapped on top

06:37:03.540 --> 06:37:05.540
Not like this.

06:37:14.540 --> 06:37:18.540
I would like to sell some weapons that are very heavy.

06:37:21.540 --> 06:37:24.540
I will keep children. I'll put it elsewhere.

06:37:28.540 --> 06:37:30.540
I don't want to sell that stuff.

06:37:30.540 --> 06:37:32.540
I'd rather keep it.

06:37:32.540 --> 06:37:36.540
I can sell, like, all of it, right? You're out of money.

06:37:38.540 --> 06:37:40.540
I will remember that.

06:37:43.540 --> 06:37:45.540
You can marry the butcher.

06:37:45.540 --> 06:37:47.540
He's not a butcher. He's a blacksmith.

06:37:47.540 --> 06:37:49.540
Those wires are really crossed on me.

06:37:49.540 --> 06:37:56.540
Please take some of my stuff that I don't need.

06:37:56.540 --> 06:37:58.540
Thanks. Appreciate it.

06:37:59.540 --> 06:38:02.540
Created potions are 1% more strong.

06:38:02.540 --> 06:38:05.540
Wait, no, actually, I'm going to keep the diamonds and stuff on me.

06:38:05.540 --> 06:38:12.540
The reason for that is because you can get, like, miscellaneous quests to ask for that basic stuff.

06:38:12.540 --> 06:38:14.540
How about you?

06:38:16.540 --> 06:38:18.540
Everything I've got on display, really.

06:38:18.540 --> 06:38:22.540
We're going to get rid of all this. This should really lighten the load.

06:38:23.540 --> 06:38:26.540
I don't want to sell that thing.

06:38:26.540 --> 06:38:29.540
Oh, I completely forgot I have, like, golders.

06:38:31.540 --> 06:38:34.540
That must be... Oh, he's not going to gold left.

06:38:34.540 --> 06:38:35.540
Oops.

06:38:35.540 --> 06:38:37.540
Oops, I'm giving away things for free.

06:38:37.540 --> 06:38:38.540
Oopsies.

06:38:38.540 --> 06:38:39.540
Oopsies, tee-hee.

06:38:39.540 --> 06:38:40.540
Little tee-hee moment.

06:38:40.540 --> 06:38:43.540
Right, we'll go Falkreath, and then we'll hit up Twilight's.

06:38:43.540 --> 06:38:45.540
I love her.

06:38:45.540 --> 06:38:48.540
Strangely, I will remember everything you said.

06:38:48.540 --> 06:38:51.540
Fair enough. I don't even know what to say half the time.

06:38:51.540 --> 06:38:52.540
I'm just here for a good time.

06:38:52.540 --> 06:38:55.540
Do you remember when we almost got our heads chopped off?

06:38:55.540 --> 06:38:57.540
Yeah, and I was taken over by bandits and burnt tickers.

06:38:57.540 --> 06:39:00.540
Tee-hee, not my problem. Tee-hee.

06:39:02.540 --> 06:39:06.540
Stony, ever dropped a bunch of jewelry in the shopping centre in Riften?

06:39:06.540 --> 06:39:10.540
Everyone starts fighting over stuff you drop,

06:39:10.540 --> 06:39:13.540
and, like, it literally terminates NPCs, and it's like,

06:39:13.540 --> 06:39:15.540
I've need them for quests.

06:39:15.540 --> 06:39:19.540
That's the one thing I could absolutely obliterate Skyrim for,

06:39:19.540 --> 06:39:24.540
is if a quest requires an NPC,

06:39:24.540 --> 06:39:27.540
do not let them be perishable.

06:39:27.540 --> 06:39:29.540
Do not let them expire.

06:39:29.540 --> 06:39:31.540
I am so sad.

06:39:31.540 --> 06:39:33.540
What the heck is...

06:39:33.540 --> 06:39:36.540
Oh, no!

06:39:38.540 --> 06:39:41.540
The wolves jumped these poor people,

06:39:41.540 --> 06:39:44.540
and the one wolf perished them both.

06:39:46.540 --> 06:39:48.540
Mmm.

06:39:48.540 --> 06:39:52.540
That's what you get for trying to execute an innocent dragonborn.

06:39:52.540 --> 06:39:54.540
Some of them are marchers,

06:39:54.540 --> 06:39:57.540
and some NPCs can't be perishable,

06:39:57.540 --> 06:39:59.540
but if they have a quest,

06:39:59.540 --> 06:40:01.540
I feel like they shouldn't be able to expire at all,

06:40:01.540 --> 06:40:04.540
because it's so annoying when you're trying to do it,

06:40:04.540 --> 06:40:06.540
and then it's like, oh, surprise, by the way.

06:40:06.540 --> 06:40:08.540
Oh, who are you? Hello.

06:40:09.540 --> 06:40:11.540
What's a milk drinker like you doing out here?

06:40:11.540 --> 06:40:13.540
Go home to your mother.

06:40:39.540 --> 06:40:44.540
Yeah, I'm starting to think we're getting, like, absolutely nothing done.

06:40:44.540 --> 06:40:47.540
We're pretty much looking at T-minus two hours.

06:40:47.540 --> 06:40:49.540
I've been live for almost seven hours.

06:40:49.540 --> 06:40:51.540
I've yet to finish the quest.

06:40:52.540 --> 06:40:54.540
Eh, right. Fault creases here.

06:40:55.540 --> 06:40:57.540
What the heck is that?

06:40:59.540 --> 06:41:00.540
Bro!

06:41:00.540 --> 06:41:03.540
You can not drop rocks on people's heads.

06:41:03.540 --> 06:41:06.540
I cannot tell you how inappropriate that is.

06:41:07.540 --> 06:41:08.540
Um...

06:41:09.540 --> 06:41:12.540
I am home with my mommy.

06:41:12.540 --> 06:41:15.540
We drink milk and tea up in this place, of course.

06:41:18.540 --> 06:41:20.540
Literally, how have I been at this for seven hours?

06:41:20.540 --> 06:41:22.540
I'm not completed one quest.

06:41:22.540 --> 06:41:24.540
Something's not adding up. I don't know.

06:41:24.540 --> 06:41:28.540
Like, I'm pretty sure the Skyrim World record is, like, two hours.

06:41:28.540 --> 06:41:31.540
Like, one hour and 52 minutes or something.

06:41:31.540 --> 06:41:33.540
Ridiculous, like that.

06:41:33.540 --> 06:41:36.540
And you're telling me in seven hours,

06:41:36.540 --> 06:41:39.540
near seven hours, I couldn't finish one quest line.

06:41:42.540 --> 06:41:45.540
Well, I need sleep. Good night. Thank you for hanging.

06:41:45.540 --> 06:41:47.540
No promises, I won't see you in my dreams.

06:41:47.540 --> 06:41:50.540
That's right. Get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish.

06:41:50.540 --> 06:41:52.540
Your only dream of a Scottish.

06:41:53.540 --> 06:41:56.540
The Highland Cows call you.

06:41:59.540 --> 06:42:01.540
Ooh, I don't want to walk over a grave.

06:42:01.540 --> 06:42:03.540
That's bad luck.

06:42:03.540 --> 06:42:06.540
That's a lot of graves. What's going on in full graves?

06:42:06.540 --> 06:42:08.540
I feel like that's probably a quest, cause...

06:42:09.540 --> 06:42:10.540
That's a lot.

06:42:11.540 --> 06:42:12.540
Scotland!

06:42:12.540 --> 06:42:14.540
Forever!

06:42:18.540 --> 06:42:20.540
Get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish.

06:42:20.540 --> 06:42:21.540
I think I need to do that.

06:42:21.540 --> 06:42:22.540
Someone did that where I was like,

06:42:22.540 --> 06:42:24.540
get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant.

06:42:24.540 --> 06:42:25.540
And it's like, dang, dang, dang.

06:42:25.540 --> 06:42:27.540
Like, really intense music.

06:42:27.540 --> 06:42:30.540
I want to do that, but like, get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish.

06:42:32.540 --> 06:42:34.540
We're almost there.

06:42:34.540 --> 06:42:36.540
We're almost there, we're almost there.

06:42:36.540 --> 06:42:38.540
We just got to run a little bit longer.

06:42:41.540 --> 06:42:43.540
Oh, there's castles and ruins.

06:42:44.540 --> 06:42:48.540
Did you know you can just straight up buy castles in Scotland?

06:42:48.540 --> 06:42:50.540
Fun fact, you can literally look up them online.

06:42:50.540 --> 06:42:52.540
Just type in Castle for sale in Scotland.

06:42:52.540 --> 06:42:54.540
I'm not even kidding.

06:42:55.540 --> 06:42:58.540
It's pretty intense and cool.

06:42:59.540 --> 06:43:01.540
And you can buy churches.

06:43:01.540 --> 06:43:03.540
It's a lot cheaper to live in a church.

06:43:03.540 --> 06:43:05.540
An ex-church, by the way.

06:43:05.540 --> 06:43:08.540
You can literally, it's like, churches for sale in Scotland.

06:43:08.540 --> 06:43:09.540
Yeah, just have a look.

06:43:09.540 --> 06:43:11.540
It's like, way cheaper.

06:43:13.540 --> 06:43:17.540
Johnny, have you heard of the Scott Wikipedia vandalism story?

06:43:17.540 --> 06:43:18.540
Yes!

06:43:18.540 --> 06:43:20.540
Oh, we should talk about it.

06:43:20.540 --> 06:43:23.540
Like, if you didn't know.

06:43:23.540 --> 06:43:26.540
So, Scots is basically slang.

06:43:26.540 --> 06:43:29.540
And we say things very phonetically.

06:43:29.540 --> 06:43:31.540
And someone...

06:43:32.540 --> 06:43:35.540
Whoa, wait, I didn't realise you were a bandit.

06:43:35.540 --> 06:43:36.540
Sorry.

06:43:36.540 --> 06:43:38.540
Time to go, buddy.

06:43:41.540 --> 06:43:43.540
And someone basically went,

06:43:43.540 --> 06:43:46.540
Oh, I'll just rewrite this in Scots.

06:43:46.540 --> 06:43:49.540
But he, like, wasn't Scottish.

06:43:49.540 --> 06:43:53.540
So he just wrote what he thought, like, Scottish folks said.

06:43:53.540 --> 06:43:55.540
And it was just complete gibberish.

06:43:55.540 --> 06:43:58.540
And he'd been doing it for ages and no one, like, caught him.

06:43:58.540 --> 06:44:00.540
Wasn't that it?

06:44:01.540 --> 06:44:05.540
He sent in Zillow to Scotland to find an affordable hoose, honestly.

06:44:07.540 --> 06:44:08.540
It's Gallus!

06:44:08.540 --> 06:44:09.540
Hello.

06:44:09.540 --> 06:44:11.540
Hello, Gallus.

06:44:18.540 --> 06:44:20.540
I visited Edinburgh.

06:44:20.540 --> 06:44:21.540
Let's go.

06:44:21.540 --> 06:44:23.540
I'd asked the same question.

06:44:24.540 --> 06:44:25.540
That's really funny.

06:44:25.540 --> 06:44:28.540
Stony's gonna buy a castle, move the wheeler team into it,

06:44:28.540 --> 06:44:30.540
then get Reeflands to serve them there.

06:44:30.540 --> 06:44:32.540
But could you imagine, though?

06:44:32.540 --> 06:44:33.540
Like, oh!

06:44:33.540 --> 06:44:36.540
You know what, you get out of this exchange?

06:44:36.540 --> 06:44:38.540
A servitude!

06:44:41.540 --> 06:44:43.540
How are you to blame?

06:44:50.540 --> 06:44:52.540
Where can I say no?

06:44:54.540 --> 06:44:57.540
Wait a minute, you're Gallus!

06:45:03.540 --> 06:45:06.540
I'm best pals with your girlfriend.

06:45:13.540 --> 06:45:15.540
How do you say I love you in Scottish?

06:45:15.540 --> 06:45:17.540
It's just I love you.

06:45:18.540 --> 06:45:22.540
Like, I love you, and then I love you.

06:45:23.540 --> 06:45:26.540
It's kind of, like, shoved together in fast.

06:45:26.540 --> 06:45:28.540
He's that adoring fan.

06:45:28.540 --> 06:45:29.540
Is he?

06:45:30.540 --> 06:45:32.540
By Azura, by Azura, by Azura.

06:45:32.540 --> 06:45:34.540
I did this for Nocturo.

06:45:34.540 --> 06:45:36.540
I did this for the honour of the guild.

06:45:41.540 --> 06:45:43.540
Carlaya helped me.

06:45:45.540 --> 06:45:47.540
Yes, your girlfriend's alive.

06:45:53.540 --> 06:45:55.540
Well, then she would have appeared here.

06:45:55.540 --> 06:45:58.540
Then take the key and right all the wrongs.

06:46:04.540 --> 06:46:06.540
When we put Stony as our cult leader,

06:46:06.540 --> 06:46:08.540
we could cut taxes and save money!

06:46:08.540 --> 06:46:09.540
Yay!

06:46:11.540 --> 06:46:13.540
We can be tax exempt together.

06:46:13.540 --> 06:46:14.540
Yippee!

06:46:15.540 --> 06:46:17.540
How can a spirit die?

06:46:24.540 --> 06:46:26.540
The Ebeneer?

06:46:26.540 --> 06:46:28.540
A bit of Ebeneer?

06:46:35.540 --> 06:46:39.540
Maintaining a historical site for tax breaks and profit?

06:46:39.540 --> 06:46:42.540
Yeah, and then we run like a massive B&B over.

06:46:42.540 --> 06:46:43.540
Oh my god.

06:46:44.540 --> 06:46:46.540
I'm afraid so.

06:46:46.540 --> 06:46:47.540
I'm weakening.

06:46:47.540 --> 06:46:50.540
And I can feel myself slipping away.

06:46:50.540 --> 06:46:52.540
The gears without restoration of my power

06:46:52.540 --> 06:46:53.540
I had to take.

06:46:53.540 --> 06:46:54.540
That's taken.

06:46:54.540 --> 06:46:56.540
You really want to mess with the IRS?

06:46:56.540 --> 06:46:58.540
That should be a song.

06:46:58.540 --> 06:47:00.540
You really want to mess with the IRS?

06:47:01.540 --> 06:47:05.540
I fought the law in the law one.

06:47:05.540 --> 06:47:07.540
Ray.

06:47:09.540 --> 06:47:10.540
Good luck, Gallus.

06:47:10.540 --> 06:47:12.540
Even though you don't have to do anything.

06:47:13.540 --> 06:47:15.540
I don't mind doing the hard work, right?

06:47:15.540 --> 06:47:16.540
Who needs a bashing?

06:47:17.540 --> 06:47:18.540
Who needs a bashing?

06:47:18.540 --> 06:47:19.540
Who's begging for the pagan?

06:47:19.540 --> 06:47:20.540
Because it's all happening at once.

06:47:20.540 --> 06:47:21.540
Let's go!

06:47:21.540 --> 06:47:22.540
I bet he do.

06:47:23.540 --> 06:47:24.540
Beat him up! Beat him up! Beat him up!

06:47:24.540 --> 06:47:25.540
Beat him up! Beat him up!

06:47:27.540 --> 06:47:29.540
Oh wow, they're actually kind of beef.

06:47:30.540 --> 06:47:33.540
They're actually a bit stronger than your average enemy.

06:47:33.540 --> 06:47:34.540
Hold on a minute.

06:47:34.540 --> 06:47:35.540
I don't like that.

06:47:36.540 --> 06:47:37.540
You, come here.

06:47:37.540 --> 06:47:38.540
No, I'm stuck on the stairs.

06:47:38.540 --> 06:47:39.540
Hold on.

06:47:39.540 --> 06:47:40.540
I'm stuck on...

06:47:41.540 --> 06:47:42.540
I'm stuck on...

06:47:42.540 --> 06:47:43.540
Ow! Ow! Stop!

06:47:43.540 --> 06:47:45.540
Swap to weapon, Ray!

06:47:45.540 --> 06:47:46.540
Stop to melee!

06:47:46.540 --> 06:47:47.540
Yes, there you go.

06:47:47.540 --> 06:47:48.540
Okay, there we go.

06:47:48.540 --> 06:47:50.540
Jeez, I lose.

06:47:51.540 --> 06:47:52.540
What is in you?

06:47:53.540 --> 06:47:54.540
Arrows?

06:47:55.540 --> 06:47:56.540
So, Jim!

06:47:57.540 --> 06:47:58.540
Alchemy.

06:48:00.540 --> 06:48:03.540
Totally not secret backtracking.

06:48:03.540 --> 06:48:05.540
I do love Skyrim for that.

06:48:05.540 --> 06:48:07.540
It's quite rather entertaining.

06:48:07.540 --> 06:48:11.540
Okay, they've got elven arrows on their persons, which is pretty...

06:48:15.540 --> 06:48:17.540
Oh, why are you so scary?

06:48:20.540 --> 06:48:21.540
I'm not gonna lie.

06:48:21.540 --> 06:48:23.540
Like, they're kind of messing me up now.

06:48:24.540 --> 06:48:26.540
Open our own velar colony?

06:48:27.540 --> 06:48:28.540
What?

06:48:28.540 --> 06:48:32.540
In the Scottish countryside with crops and feudal lordship for the grove?

06:48:32.540 --> 06:48:33.540
Bruh!

06:48:35.540 --> 06:48:38.540
Look, sometimes a sense of community is all you need if...

06:48:38.540 --> 06:48:39.540
Oh!

06:48:39.540 --> 06:48:41.540
Wait, I'm to stay in the dark.

06:48:42.540 --> 06:48:45.540
Right, if you stay in the dark, your health doesn't get...

06:48:48.540 --> 06:48:50.540
Well, wasn't he paying attention to that?

06:48:50.540 --> 06:48:51.540
Was he?

06:48:51.540 --> 06:48:52.540
Clearly, no.

06:48:53.540 --> 06:48:56.540
Yeah, you just need to stay in the dark so you don't get hurt in this section.

06:48:56.540 --> 06:48:58.540
It's not really too bad at all.

06:48:58.540 --> 06:49:00.540
I just can't see nothing in it at all.

06:49:01.540 --> 06:49:02.540
Oh!

06:49:02.540 --> 06:49:05.540
Just a wee bit of poison, just a few darts in my eyeballs.

06:49:05.540 --> 06:49:06.540
It's fine, it's fine.

06:49:06.540 --> 06:49:08.540
I can still see for the most part.

06:49:09.540 --> 06:49:10.540
Wish I wore my glasses.

06:49:18.540 --> 06:49:19.540
My lady!

06:49:20.540 --> 06:49:21.540
Hello!

06:49:22.540 --> 06:49:25.540
Oh, a bandit got all the way here.

06:49:26.540 --> 06:49:27.540
Hello, my lady!

06:49:27.540 --> 06:49:30.540
Please ignore the fact that I'm taking your offering.

06:49:30.540 --> 06:49:32.540
So fragmented, I don't need that.

06:49:33.540 --> 06:49:36.540
Uh, uh, behind here is two chains to pull.

06:49:37.540 --> 06:49:38.540
Gammy!

06:49:40.540 --> 06:49:41.540
Atlas!

06:49:42.540 --> 06:49:43.540
Where's Blossom?

06:49:44.540 --> 06:49:45.540
Where's Gammy?

06:49:45.540 --> 06:49:49.540
That's Gammy, the girl, and that's her dad, Atlas.

06:49:49.540 --> 06:49:51.540
And Blossom's her mummy.

06:49:52.540 --> 06:49:53.540
Hmm.

06:49:53.540 --> 06:49:55.540
Is it true if you buy land in Skull, you become a lord?

06:49:55.540 --> 06:49:58.540
No, that is completely false.

06:49:58.540 --> 06:50:03.540
Um, if you take that in, by the way, you'll actually...

06:50:04.540 --> 06:50:05.540
Um...

06:50:09.540 --> 06:50:10.540
I knew...

06:50:10.540 --> 06:50:12.540
Ow!

06:50:12.540 --> 06:50:14.540
Oh my god, I just got reeled by a log.

06:50:14.540 --> 06:50:16.540
That wasn't really that fun, I'm gonna be honest.

06:50:18.540 --> 06:50:19.540
Wait, we did it, we did it.

06:50:19.540 --> 06:50:20.540
We're here, we're here.

06:50:20.540 --> 06:50:22.540
Snowberry's waiting on Icey's every need,

06:50:22.540 --> 06:50:24.540
Penpal's being picked for a set of me.

06:50:27.540 --> 06:50:30.540
Oh, it's all spooky, it's all spooky and purple.

06:50:32.540 --> 06:50:34.540
Oh, I love the color scheme.

06:50:36.540 --> 06:50:38.540
Oh, I remember this.

06:50:41.540 --> 06:50:43.540
Oh no, I'm stuck.

06:50:45.540 --> 06:50:46.540
I should read his note.

06:50:47.540 --> 06:50:48.540
Anderson's...

06:50:48.540 --> 06:50:49.540
Anderson's message.

06:51:07.540 --> 06:51:08.540
I don't think he made it, chief.

06:51:08.540 --> 06:51:09.540
I don't think he made it.

06:51:09.540 --> 06:51:10.540
Yeah.

06:51:11.540 --> 06:51:12.540
Uh...

06:51:13.540 --> 06:51:15.540
If only we had some sort of...

06:51:16.540 --> 06:51:17.540
Key?

06:51:18.540 --> 06:51:21.540
Some sort of skeleton...

06:51:22.540 --> 06:51:23.540
Key?

06:51:23.540 --> 06:51:24.540
Yep.

06:51:38.540 --> 06:51:39.540
Oh, I'm stuck.

06:51:40.540 --> 06:51:41.540
I got...

06:51:46.540 --> 06:51:47.540
Oh, that's...

06:51:47.540 --> 06:51:48.540
Gammies!

06:51:48.540 --> 06:51:50.540
Look at all Gammie's babies!

06:51:50.540 --> 06:51:51.540
Oh, I'm in the wrong way.

06:51:51.540 --> 06:51:52.540
Sorry, Hen.

06:51:57.540 --> 06:52:00.540
Tell me that ain't good design.

06:52:01.540 --> 06:52:04.540
Excuse me, we'll stay a little around.

06:52:05.540 --> 06:52:06.540
Oh yeah.

06:52:06.540 --> 06:52:07.540
Yeah.

06:52:08.540 --> 06:52:09.540
Oh yeah.

06:52:16.540 --> 06:52:17.540
Oh yeah.

06:52:29.540 --> 06:52:32.540
Nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.

06:52:33.540 --> 06:52:36.540
We must stay focused, Reeflings.

06:52:36.540 --> 06:52:38.540
We must stay focused.

06:53:03.540 --> 06:53:04.540
Oh no.

06:53:08.540 --> 06:53:09.540
Wow!

06:53:09.540 --> 06:53:10.540
Drink?

06:53:20.540 --> 06:53:21.540
Bye-bye, mommy!

06:53:21.540 --> 06:53:22.540
Bye-bye, mommy!

06:53:28.540 --> 06:53:30.540
Where did you come from?

06:53:30.540 --> 06:53:31.540
Hello.

06:53:31.540 --> 06:53:32.540
Oh, sorry.

06:53:33.540 --> 06:53:34.540
Oh, sorry.

06:53:34.540 --> 06:53:35.540
Oh, sorry.

06:53:36.540 --> 06:53:37.540
Can I talk to you now?

06:53:39.540 --> 06:53:40.540
Yes.

06:53:43.540 --> 06:53:46.540
Uh, please, she sounded indifferent.

06:54:02.540 --> 06:54:08.540
What's this about becoming an agent and a nocturnal?

06:54:13.540 --> 06:54:14.540
What?

06:54:17.540 --> 06:54:18.540
Present moon?

06:54:18.540 --> 06:54:20.540
I think is what we want.

06:54:20.540 --> 06:54:23.540
A full moon for the agent of strife.

06:54:24.540 --> 06:54:27.540
This is nocturnal's role in maintaining balance.

06:54:28.540 --> 06:54:32.540
How is this goddess of stealth when it's clear?

06:54:32.540 --> 06:54:33.540
Ha!

06:54:33.540 --> 06:54:38.540
The clap of her cheeks would alarm the guards on a 500 meter radius.

06:54:40.540 --> 06:54:41.540
It's unfamiliar.

06:54:41.540 --> 06:54:43.540
Her hotness is so powerful.

06:54:48.540 --> 06:54:49.540
And you?

06:54:51.540 --> 06:54:52.540
Aw.

06:54:55.540 --> 06:54:56.540
The beginning of what?

06:55:04.540 --> 06:55:05.540
Wow.

06:55:10.540 --> 06:55:12.540
They're not good at what we do.

06:55:14.540 --> 06:55:15.540
Uh, I think stealth.

06:55:15.540 --> 06:55:17.540
Tell me about the present, then.

06:55:20.540 --> 06:55:21.540
Yeah, okay.

06:55:21.540 --> 06:55:23.540
Well, you do the agent of...

06:55:24.540 --> 06:55:26.540
Are you a crescent moon?

06:55:26.540 --> 06:55:28.540
You're a full moon.

06:55:28.540 --> 06:55:29.540
And you're a half moon.

06:55:29.540 --> 06:55:30.540
Okay, crescent moon.

06:55:32.540 --> 06:55:33.540
Hee-hee.

06:55:33.540 --> 06:55:34.540
Okay, now what?

06:55:35.540 --> 06:55:36.540
Oh, no.

06:55:36.540 --> 06:55:37.540
Gallus is about to come...

06:55:40.540 --> 06:55:43.540
Ooh, look, it's Gallus and Karnaya.

06:55:43.540 --> 06:55:45.540
They're gonna kiss.

06:55:50.540 --> 06:55:51.540
Come like the others.

06:55:52.540 --> 06:55:55.540
If it were not for the actions of this knight in the air,

06:55:55.540 --> 06:55:58.540
what the years would have come through.

06:55:58.540 --> 06:56:01.540
She would have just lost all of it.

06:56:01.540 --> 06:56:03.540
You do now, my love.

06:56:04.540 --> 06:56:07.540
Nocturnal calls me to the Everglow.

06:56:07.540 --> 06:56:10.540
My contract has been fulfilled.

06:56:11.540 --> 06:56:13.540
When I ever see you again.

06:56:13.540 --> 06:56:16.540
When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid,

06:56:16.540 --> 06:56:18.540
we'll embrace what's there.

06:56:18.540 --> 06:56:19.540
Aww.

06:56:25.540 --> 06:56:27.540
I've been 25 years since you've seen each other,

06:56:27.540 --> 06:56:28.540
and this is it.

06:56:28.540 --> 06:56:30.540
This is what they muster.

06:56:31.540 --> 06:56:32.540
Are you alright, Karnaya?

06:56:32.540 --> 06:56:33.540
Maybe it's just not...

06:56:33.540 --> 06:56:35.540
It shouldn't understand.

06:56:36.540 --> 06:56:38.540
Oh, he's going to disappear into the bowl of soup.

06:56:38.540 --> 06:56:40.540
Oh, he's in the bowl of soup, lads.

06:56:40.540 --> 06:56:43.540
Sorry, I'm sure it's really emotional.

06:56:44.540 --> 06:56:47.540
Where did Gallus go in a bowl of soup?

06:56:49.540 --> 06:56:52.540
The spirit becomes one with the Everglow.

06:56:55.540 --> 06:56:56.540
Ah.

06:56:56.540 --> 06:56:58.540
So he's gone?

06:57:02.540 --> 06:57:03.540
Okay.

06:57:05.540 --> 06:57:08.540
You drank the ghost soup, honestly.

06:57:11.540 --> 06:57:14.540
They're a part of the darkness around us?

06:57:19.540 --> 06:57:22.540
Oh, they're so cool.

06:57:34.540 --> 06:57:37.540
Oh, I'm getting it now.

06:57:37.540 --> 06:57:39.540
How will I know if I'm needed here?

06:57:42.540 --> 06:57:43.540
Okay.

06:57:48.540 --> 06:57:50.540
Use it whenever you wish.

06:57:51.540 --> 06:57:52.540
Okay.

06:57:54.540 --> 06:57:55.540
Where will you be?

06:57:55.540 --> 06:57:58.540
I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall.

06:57:58.540 --> 06:58:00.540
Since it's your home as well,

06:58:00.540 --> 06:58:02.540
I hope to see you and Brynjolf there.

06:58:03.540 --> 06:58:06.540
Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities too.

06:58:06.540 --> 06:58:09.540
The quiet thing is from time to time.

06:58:09.540 --> 06:58:11.540
Can't afford to get rusty now, can we?

06:58:12.540 --> 06:58:13.540
Well, I'm...

06:58:13.540 --> 06:58:15.540
I'm satisfied.

06:58:16.540 --> 06:58:18.540
Yeah, yeah, bye-bye. Okay, thank you.

06:58:19.540 --> 06:58:20.540
Thank you, hubby-bee.

06:58:20.540 --> 06:58:22.540
Is this your home now?

06:58:22.540 --> 06:58:23.540
It is!

06:58:23.540 --> 06:58:25.540
Okay, so she just hangs out here now.

06:58:25.540 --> 06:58:27.540
Girl, that's a bit depressive.

06:58:27.540 --> 06:58:29.540
But anyway, that's all new.

06:58:29.540 --> 06:58:31.540
As long as you're having a good time and all that.

06:58:31.540 --> 06:58:35.540
Thanks for the experience of being in Nightingale.

06:58:36.540 --> 06:58:38.540
Alright, have a good night and good luck.

06:58:38.540 --> 06:58:39.540
Thank you!

06:58:39.540 --> 06:58:41.540
For those of you who need to go rest, please do rest.

06:58:41.540 --> 06:58:44.540
I am literally farting about, um...

06:58:45.540 --> 06:58:47.540
Cause...

06:58:47.540 --> 06:58:50.540
Mercy is going live in two hours.

06:58:50.540 --> 06:58:52.540
I'm gonna redirect into her,

06:58:52.540 --> 06:58:54.540
and then it means I can...

06:58:54.540 --> 06:58:56.540
do a little bit of...

06:58:56.540 --> 06:59:00.540
a little bit of preparation for my monetization stream tomorrow.

06:59:00.540 --> 06:59:02.540
I'll need to actually make the thumbnail,

06:59:02.540 --> 06:59:04.540
and you get a picture of my frickin' feet for the thumbnail.

06:59:04.540 --> 06:59:05.540
Omega at low.

06:59:07.540 --> 06:59:09.540
Oh no, what did I do now?

06:59:10.540 --> 06:59:12.540
Well, we do...

06:59:12.540 --> 06:59:13.540
Night...

06:59:13.540 --> 06:59:16.540
Night mother, night mother, send your child unto me for...

06:59:16.540 --> 06:59:17.540
Oh no, sweet mother.

06:59:17.540 --> 06:59:19.540
I keep saying night mother.

06:59:19.540 --> 06:59:21.540
Apparently...

06:59:21.540 --> 06:59:23.540
it's sweet mother.

06:59:23.540 --> 06:59:26.540
I could've sworn I turned that on.

06:59:26.540 --> 06:59:27.540
Man, there we go.

06:59:27.540 --> 06:59:29.540
Yeah.

06:59:29.540 --> 06:59:32.540
Group brushing, T-minus 90 minutes, yes.

06:59:32.540 --> 06:59:33.540
Um, right.

06:59:33.540 --> 06:59:35.540
I am going to make a cup of tea

06:59:35.540 --> 06:59:37.540
if we would all like to get something to hydrate.

06:59:37.540 --> 06:59:39.540
Gotta go to Winterhold for that one.

06:59:39.540 --> 06:59:40.540
Yes.

06:59:40.540 --> 06:59:43.540
I'm gonna make a cup of tea,

06:59:43.540 --> 06:59:45.540
and then...

06:59:45.540 --> 06:59:46.540
we will...

06:59:46.540 --> 06:59:49.540
see how far we can get on the Dark Brotherhood.

06:59:49.540 --> 06:59:51.540
There's absolutely no way in heck

06:59:51.540 --> 06:59:54.540
we are getting anywhere close to it.

06:59:54.540 --> 06:59:56.540
Um...

06:59:56.540 --> 06:59:57.540
But...

06:59:57.540 --> 06:59:59.540
it doesn't mean we can't start it.

06:59:59.540 --> 07:00:00.540
Okay, man.

07:00:00.540 --> 07:00:02.540
I'll arrive late for tomorrow's stream,

07:00:02.540 --> 07:00:03.540
cause I'll be at work.

07:00:03.540 --> 07:00:05.540
It's a very short stream tomorrow.

07:00:05.540 --> 07:00:07.540
It's not Skyrim Part 2.

07:00:07.540 --> 07:00:09.540
Just, uh...

07:00:09.540 --> 07:00:11.540
for those of you who may be lurking,

07:00:11.540 --> 07:00:13.540
there is not a Skyrim Part 2 tomorrow,

07:00:13.540 --> 07:00:15.540
cause I've completely messed up the achievements,

07:00:15.540 --> 07:00:18.540
and the whole point was to do the achievements,

07:00:18.540 --> 07:00:20.540
um...

07:00:20.540 --> 07:00:22.540
and for some reason they're not working,

07:00:22.540 --> 07:00:24.540
even though I am on Xbox Game Pass.

07:00:24.540 --> 07:00:25.540
Um...

07:00:25.540 --> 07:00:27.540
But we do have plenty of time in the future.

07:00:27.540 --> 07:00:29.540
I will definitely come back to Skyrim

07:00:29.540 --> 07:00:31.540
once I've fixed whatever's going on.

07:00:31.540 --> 07:00:33.540
Cause honestly, I'm like,

07:00:33.540 --> 07:00:35.540
I should have just played cameo.

07:00:35.540 --> 07:00:37.540
Um...

07:00:39.540 --> 07:00:41.540
Sorry, we need to break in here

07:00:41.540 --> 07:00:43.540
so we can go talk to this kid.

07:00:43.540 --> 07:00:45.540
Sweet mother, sweet mother,

07:00:45.540 --> 07:00:47.540
send your child unto me

07:00:47.540 --> 07:00:49.540
for this soon.

07:00:49.540 --> 07:00:51.540
Very tired.

07:00:51.540 --> 07:00:53.540
Oh no.

07:00:53.540 --> 07:00:55.540
Sweet mother, sweet mother,

07:00:55.540 --> 07:00:57.540
send your child unto me.

07:00:57.540 --> 07:00:59.540
Send your child unto me.

07:01:01.540 --> 07:01:03.540
So you come in.

07:01:03.540 --> 07:01:05.540
How long must I do this?

07:01:05.540 --> 07:01:07.540
I keep praying, mother,

07:01:07.540 --> 07:01:09.540
for I want you to answer me.

07:01:09.540 --> 07:01:11.540
S.

07:01:11.540 --> 07:01:13.540
You've come at last. I knew you would.

07:01:13.540 --> 07:01:15.540
Are you alright?

07:01:15.540 --> 07:01:17.540
I knew you'd come. I just knew it.

07:01:17.540 --> 07:01:19.540
I did the Black Sacrament

07:01:19.540 --> 07:01:21.540
over and over with the body

07:01:21.540 --> 07:01:23.540
and the things that came

07:01:23.540 --> 07:01:25.540
in a assassin from the Dark Brotherhood.

07:01:25.540 --> 07:01:27.540
Uh...

07:01:29.540 --> 07:01:31.540
Ah yes, the Black Sacrament

07:01:31.540 --> 07:01:33.540
of course.

07:01:33.540 --> 07:01:35.540
So long. So very long.

07:01:35.540 --> 07:01:37.540
But now that you're here,

07:01:37.540 --> 07:01:39.540
you can accept my contract.

07:01:39.540 --> 07:01:41.540
Your contract?

07:01:41.540 --> 07:01:43.540
My mother, she...

07:01:43.540 --> 07:01:45.540
she died.

07:01:45.540 --> 07:01:47.540
I'm all alone now.

07:01:47.540 --> 07:01:49.540
So they sent me to the terrible orphanage

07:01:49.540 --> 07:01:51.540
in Riften on her hall.

07:01:51.540 --> 07:01:53.540
The headmistress is an evil cruel woman.

07:01:53.540 --> 07:01:55.540
They call her Grelad the kind.

07:01:55.540 --> 07:01:57.540
But she's not kind.

07:01:57.540 --> 07:01:59.540
She's terrible to all of us.

07:01:59.540 --> 07:02:01.540
So I ran away

07:02:01.540 --> 07:02:03.540
and came home and performed

07:02:03.540 --> 07:02:05.540
the Black Sacrament.

07:02:05.540 --> 07:02:07.540
Now you're here and you can kill

07:02:07.540 --> 07:02:09.540
Grelad the kind.

07:02:09.540 --> 07:02:11.540
Ah...

07:02:11.540 --> 07:02:13.540
Sure, buddy.

07:02:15.540 --> 07:02:17.540
A kiss by the sweet mother.

07:02:17.540 --> 07:02:19.540
What does the book say? Hand that book over.

07:02:19.540 --> 07:02:21.540
So you wish to summon the Dark Brotherhood.

07:02:21.540 --> 07:02:23.540
You wish to see someone dead.

07:02:23.540 --> 07:02:25.540
Pray, child, pray,

07:02:25.540 --> 07:02:27.540
and let the Night Mother hear your plea.

07:02:27.540 --> 07:02:29.540
You must perform

07:02:29.540 --> 07:02:31.540
that most profane of rituals,

07:02:31.540 --> 07:02:33.540
the Black Sacrament.

07:02:33.540 --> 07:02:35.540
Create an effigy

07:02:35.540 --> 07:02:37.540
of the intended victim

07:02:37.540 --> 07:02:39.540
assembled from actual body parts

07:02:39.540 --> 07:02:41.540
including a heart, skull,

07:02:41.540 --> 07:02:43.540
bones and flesh.

07:02:43.540 --> 07:02:45.540
Encircle that effigy with candles.

07:02:45.540 --> 07:02:47.540
The ritual itself must then commence.

07:02:47.540 --> 07:02:49.540
Proceed to stab the effigy

07:02:49.540 --> 07:02:51.540
repeatedly with a dagger.

07:02:51.540 --> 07:02:53.540
Rubbed with the petals

07:02:53.540 --> 07:02:55.540
of a nightshade plant

07:02:55.540 --> 07:02:57.540
while whispering this plea.

07:02:57.540 --> 07:02:59.540
Sweet mother, sweet mother,

07:02:59.540 --> 07:03:01.540
send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy

07:03:01.540 --> 07:03:03.540
must be baptized in blood and fear.

07:03:03.540 --> 07:03:05.540
Then wait, child,

07:03:05.540 --> 07:03:07.540
for the dread father

07:03:07.540 --> 07:03:09.540
sithis rewards the patient.

07:03:09.540 --> 07:03:11.540
You will be visited

07:03:11.540 --> 07:03:13.540
by a representative of the Dark Brotherhood.

07:03:13.540 --> 07:03:15.540
So begins

07:03:15.540 --> 07:03:17.540
a contract bound in blood.

07:03:17.540 --> 07:03:19.540
That's actually really cool.

07:03:19.540 --> 07:03:21.540
Oh, I'm quite happy with that.

07:03:21.540 --> 07:03:23.540
I quite like that kind of back

07:03:23.540 --> 07:03:25.540
behind the scenes, not behind the scenes

07:03:25.540 --> 07:03:27.540
because it's like hidden in a book so it's not behind the scenes.

07:03:27.540 --> 07:03:29.540
But I like

07:03:29.540 --> 07:03:31.540
seeing how the game like tried to

07:03:31.540 --> 07:03:33.540
explain it.

07:03:33.540 --> 07:03:35.540
It's a great thing. Where did he find

07:03:35.540 --> 07:03:37.540
the body part? Oh, he tried his best, okay.

07:03:37.540 --> 07:03:39.540
Probably went into the crypt

07:03:39.540 --> 07:03:41.540
or something like that.

07:03:41.540 --> 07:03:43.540
So this is probably the only

07:03:43.540 --> 07:03:45.540
instance when you can

07:03:45.540 --> 07:03:47.540
perish someone in front of a whole group

07:03:47.540 --> 07:03:49.540
of people.

07:03:49.540 --> 07:03:51.540
Sorry, hen.

07:03:55.540 --> 07:03:57.540
Yeah, you do not get in trouble for doing

07:03:57.540 --> 07:03:59.540
that. And all the kids

07:04:01.540 --> 07:04:03.540
and they're like laughing

07:04:03.540 --> 07:04:05.540
at our own stuff.

07:04:05.540 --> 07:04:07.540
Wait, oh, I've gone the wrong way.

07:04:07.540 --> 07:04:09.540
Sorry, I've gone the wrong way.

07:04:09.540 --> 07:04:11.540
We're saved.

07:04:13.540 --> 07:04:15.540
Yeah, literally

07:04:15.540 --> 07:04:17.540
one of the only instances you can

07:04:17.540 --> 07:04:19.540
walk in and perish someone and then come

07:04:19.540 --> 07:04:21.540
straight back out again.

07:04:21.540 --> 07:04:23.540
They don't care. No one cares.

07:04:23.540 --> 07:04:25.540
The Riften Guards don't even care.

07:04:25.540 --> 07:04:27.540
They must have known as well.

07:04:27.540 --> 07:04:29.540
The actual nice lady takes over.

07:04:29.540 --> 07:04:31.540
Yeah.

07:04:31.540 --> 07:04:33.540
So really, we just did everyone a big old favor.

07:04:33.540 --> 07:04:35.540
Okay.

07:04:35.540 --> 07:04:37.540
I was like finding

07:04:37.540 --> 07:04:39.540
different fun ways. Apparently you can cast

07:04:39.540 --> 07:04:41.540
Friendsly in the Children

07:04:41.540 --> 07:04:43.540
Parish Grail Oak. I'm not sure if that's true

07:04:43.540 --> 07:04:45.540
or not.

07:04:45.540 --> 07:04:47.540
Is she, you know,

07:04:47.540 --> 07:04:49.540
kind of sounds like

07:04:49.540 --> 07:04:51.540
Midoriya.

07:04:51.540 --> 07:04:53.540
I knew you could do it.

07:04:53.540 --> 07:04:55.540
I just knew it. I knew the Dark Brotherhood

07:04:55.540 --> 07:04:57.540
would save me. Here, just like

07:04:57.540 --> 07:04:59.540
I promised. This should bet you a nice

07:04:59.540 --> 07:05:01.540
price. Thank you.

07:05:01.540 --> 07:05:03.540
Thank you again.

07:05:03.540 --> 07:05:05.540
What did you give me? Your child.

07:05:05.540 --> 07:05:07.540
Completed Innocence Loss.

07:05:09.540 --> 07:05:11.540
Family heirloom?

07:05:11.540 --> 07:05:13.540
Oh, sorry, sorry.

07:05:13.540 --> 07:05:15.540
My bad. I got a little...

07:05:15.540 --> 07:05:17.540
I just needed to check what your family

07:05:17.540 --> 07:05:19.540
heirloom was.

07:05:19.540 --> 07:05:21.540
Is it any?

07:05:21.540 --> 07:05:23.540
Oh, there is.

07:05:23.540 --> 07:05:25.540
A plate? A plate.

07:05:25.540 --> 07:05:27.540
I mean, you are a child, so I guess that makes

07:05:27.540 --> 07:05:29.540
sense.

07:05:29.540 --> 07:05:31.540
Now, if I remember correctly,

07:05:31.540 --> 07:05:33.540
we need to go sleep in a bed.

07:05:33.540 --> 07:05:35.540
Yeah, the first sleep

07:05:35.540 --> 07:05:37.540
the poor Dragonborn has had since I started

07:05:37.540 --> 07:05:39.540
my adventures.

07:05:39.540 --> 07:05:41.540
So, we'll just rent a little bed in here.

07:05:43.540 --> 07:05:45.540
You ever just accidentally dash across the house, honestly?

07:05:47.540 --> 07:05:49.540
Oh, you. Hello.

07:05:51.540 --> 07:05:53.540
Can you come a bit closer?

07:05:53.540 --> 07:05:55.540
Okay, I guess not.

07:05:55.540 --> 07:05:57.540
Yeah, I'd like to rent a room.

07:05:57.540 --> 07:05:59.540
Thanks, darling.

07:05:59.540 --> 07:06:01.540
Oh, okay.

07:06:01.540 --> 07:06:03.540
Ten, ten stars.

07:06:05.540 --> 07:06:07.540
Hello, my lady.

07:06:07.540 --> 07:06:09.540
You want to join me?

07:06:15.540 --> 07:06:17.540
Okay.

07:06:19.540 --> 07:06:21.540
Right, please stop talking to me. I'm trying to be

07:06:21.540 --> 07:06:23.540
sure in my room, but I'm having to help the NPC.

07:06:23.540 --> 07:06:25.540
Okay, there we go. Thank you for showing me my room.

07:06:27.540 --> 07:06:29.540
If you want the tip, just stay in the room.

07:06:29.540 --> 07:06:31.540
We're getting that bed.

07:06:31.540 --> 07:06:33.540
That's absolutely shocking behaviour.

07:06:33.540 --> 07:06:35.540
Please stop.

07:06:35.540 --> 07:06:37.540
Twelvers, we won't make a cup of tea very

07:06:37.540 --> 07:06:39.540
shortly. I'm sorry.

07:06:39.540 --> 07:06:41.540
I'm getting delirious.

07:06:41.540 --> 07:06:43.540
Miss Droney, can I be excused from history

07:06:43.540 --> 07:06:45.540
of the Nordic class to use the bathroom?

07:06:45.540 --> 07:06:47.540
Yes, you're allowed to use the toilet.

07:06:47.540 --> 07:06:49.540
Right, I am going

07:06:49.540 --> 07:06:51.540
to go make a cup of tea.

07:06:55.540 --> 07:06:57.540
What? Was that not supposed to be kidnapped?

07:06:59.540 --> 07:07:01.540
Was that not supposed to be kidnapped?

07:07:01.540 --> 07:07:03.540
After you perish?

07:07:07.540 --> 07:07:09.540
Does it have to be about the island?

07:07:15.540 --> 07:07:17.540
Huh.

07:07:19.540 --> 07:07:21.540
Give her to her, kid.

07:07:21.540 --> 07:07:23.540
It's after you receive a courier's lair.

07:07:23.540 --> 07:07:25.540
Ah!

07:07:25.540 --> 07:07:27.540
How are you streaming now? How are you so powerful?

07:07:27.540 --> 07:07:29.540
That's...

07:07:29.540 --> 07:07:31.540
It's called Othezam.

07:07:31.540 --> 07:07:33.540
And I love my games.

07:07:33.540 --> 07:07:35.540
Right, I'm waiting on the courier.

07:07:35.540 --> 07:07:37.540
Courier, courier.

07:07:37.540 --> 07:07:39.540
Courier, courier. Give me a letter.

07:07:39.540 --> 07:07:41.540
Courier, my boss.

07:07:41.540 --> 07:07:43.540
Right, ah, sorry.

07:07:43.540 --> 07:07:45.540
I'm going to go get a cup of tea to recalibrate

07:07:45.540 --> 07:07:47.540
because I have been playing for a hot second.

07:07:47.540 --> 07:07:49.540
I'm going to have to pause the game

07:07:49.540 --> 07:07:51.540
sadly because there can be NPC

07:07:51.540 --> 07:07:53.540
events such as Coltas entering

07:07:53.540 --> 07:07:55.540
the town which can kill NPCs.

07:07:55.540 --> 07:07:57.540
So I will have it paused

07:07:57.540 --> 07:07:59.540
whilst I go quickly make a cup of tea.

07:07:59.540 --> 07:08:01.540
Please do

07:08:01.540 --> 07:08:03.540
stretch your legs

07:08:03.540 --> 07:08:05.540
and get yourself a wee water

07:08:05.540 --> 07:08:07.540
and have a pee.

07:08:09.540 --> 07:08:11.540
You got to sleep.

07:08:11.540 --> 07:08:13.540
No.

07:08:13.540 --> 07:08:15.540
Alright, sorry man.

07:08:15.540 --> 07:08:17.540
I thought you had to sleep right away

07:08:17.540 --> 07:08:19.540
but I need to receive the letter

07:08:19.540 --> 07:08:21.540
with a hand that says we know and then go to sleep.

07:08:21.540 --> 07:08:23.540
Okay?

07:08:23.540 --> 07:08:25.540
I'm going to go get some water.

07:08:25.540 --> 07:08:27.540
I'm going to get a cup of tea

07:08:27.540 --> 07:08:29.540
and we're going to recalibrate and come back

07:08:29.540 --> 07:08:31.540
and meet in the middle.

07:08:31.540 --> 07:08:33.540
It will be a couple of minutes, okay?

07:08:33.540 --> 07:08:35.540
I think I can get a wee snack

07:08:35.540 --> 07:08:37.540
as well.

07:08:37.540 --> 07:08:39.540
Right, beer, beer.

07:08:53.540 --> 07:08:55.540
Thank you.

07:09:23.540 --> 07:09:25.540
Thank you.

07:09:53.540 --> 07:09:55.540
Thank you.

07:10:23.540 --> 07:10:25.540
Thank you.

07:10:53.540 --> 07:10:55.540
Thank you.

07:11:23.540 --> 07:11:25.540
Thank you.

07:11:53.540 --> 07:11:55.540
Thank you.

07:12:23.540 --> 07:12:25.540
Thank you.

07:12:53.540 --> 07:12:55.540
Thank you.

07:13:23.540 --> 07:13:25.540
Thank you.

07:13:53.540 --> 07:13:55.540
Thank you.

07:14:23.540 --> 07:14:25.540
Thank you.

07:14:53.540 --> 07:14:55.540
Welcome to Europe.

07:14:55.540 --> 07:14:57.540
Wait, I said that wrong.

07:14:57.540 --> 07:14:59.540
Welcome to Europe, young man.

07:14:59.540 --> 07:15:01.540
Welcome to Europe.

07:15:01.540 --> 07:15:03.540
Welcome to Europe.

07:15:03.540 --> 07:15:05.540
Remember the 10 Eurovision?

07:15:05.540 --> 07:15:07.540
Remember the 10 Eurovision?

07:15:07.540 --> 07:15:09.540
Sorry.

07:15:09.540 --> 07:15:11.540
I'm sorry.

07:15:11.540 --> 07:15:13.540
I'm sorry.

07:15:13.540 --> 07:15:15.540
I'm sorry.

07:15:15.540 --> 07:15:17.540
I'm sorry.

07:15:17.540 --> 07:15:19.540
I'm sorry.

07:15:19.540 --> 07:15:21.540
I'm sorry.

07:15:21.540 --> 07:15:23.540
Sorry, that was the worst Dutch

07:15:23.540 --> 07:15:25.540
I think I've ever done so far.

07:15:25.540 --> 07:15:27.540
I do apologize to any

07:15:27.540 --> 07:15:29.540
Nederland mensen

07:15:29.540 --> 07:15:31.540
who are listening in.

07:15:31.540 --> 07:15:33.540
Everyone else is just like,

07:15:33.540 --> 07:15:35.540
what on earth are you even on about?

07:15:35.540 --> 07:15:37.540
Hi.

07:15:37.540 --> 07:15:39.540
Welcome back.

07:15:39.540 --> 07:15:41.540
What, you thought I was gone forever?

07:15:41.540 --> 07:15:43.540
I've got me a cup of tea

07:15:43.540 --> 07:15:45.540
and I've actually got stroepwafel.

07:15:45.540 --> 07:15:47.540
I'm not even kidding.

07:15:47.540 --> 07:15:49.540
I have actual stroepwafel.

07:15:49.540 --> 07:15:51.540
On the rating stream

07:15:51.540 --> 07:15:53.540
but I couldn't find any more

07:15:53.540 --> 07:15:55.540
European snacks.

07:15:55.540 --> 07:15:57.540
So I'm just literally going to

07:15:57.540 --> 07:15:59.540
eat a little stroepwafel.

07:16:01.540 --> 07:16:03.540
Welcome back.

07:16:03.540 --> 07:16:05.540
I love stroepwafel.

07:16:05.540 --> 07:16:07.540
It's like crack cocaine.

07:16:07.540 --> 07:16:09.540
Sorry, but it's so good.

07:16:11.540 --> 07:16:13.540
Yes, merci for the snippets

07:16:13.540 --> 07:16:15.540
who are lurking.

07:16:15.540 --> 07:16:17.540
I appreciate you even if I'm not your

07:16:17.540 --> 07:16:19.540
flavor.

07:16:19.540 --> 07:16:21.540
T minus one hour

07:16:21.540 --> 07:16:23.540
and 40 minutes

07:16:23.540 --> 07:16:25.540
until your

07:16:25.540 --> 07:16:27.540
Kohai

07:16:27.540 --> 07:16:29.540
is ready to say hi hi

07:16:29.540 --> 07:16:31.540
and prove that

07:16:31.540 --> 07:16:33.540
she can't whistle.

07:16:33.540 --> 07:16:35.540
Which is adorable.

07:16:35.540 --> 07:16:37.540
I can't believe that I hired her on the basis she can't

07:16:37.540 --> 07:16:39.540
whistle. Stop leaving

07:16:39.540 --> 07:16:41.540
I'm not allowed to go get a cup

07:16:41.540 --> 07:16:43.540
of tea for my

07:16:43.540 --> 07:16:45.540
boys.

07:16:45.540 --> 07:16:47.540
Are you like hearing my words?

07:16:47.540 --> 07:16:49.540
Are you ending

07:16:49.540 --> 07:16:51.540
when merci comes on?

07:16:51.540 --> 07:16:53.540
Yes, I'm going to redirect into her on purpose

07:16:53.540 --> 07:16:55.540
because

07:16:55.540 --> 07:16:57.540
I didn't know I was getting monetization

07:16:57.540 --> 07:16:59.540
today.

07:16:59.540 --> 07:17:01.540
So tomorrow we're doing the monetization

07:17:01.540 --> 07:17:03.540
celebration.

07:17:03.540 --> 07:17:05.540
So I need to set up

07:17:05.540 --> 07:17:07.540
all the emotes and I need to set up on the

07:17:07.540 --> 07:17:09.540
price.

07:17:09.540 --> 07:17:11.540
And I think very sadly I have to

07:17:11.540 --> 07:17:13.540
charge more than 4.99

07:17:13.540 --> 07:17:15.540
US dollars.

07:17:15.540 --> 07:17:17.540
But I think I might have to

07:17:17.540 --> 07:17:19.540
because of this YouTube gifting

07:17:19.540 --> 07:17:21.540
stuff.

07:17:21.540 --> 07:17:23.540
Can any of yous confirm that

07:17:23.540 --> 07:17:25.540
YouTube gifting thing is a nightmare

07:17:25.540 --> 07:17:27.540
or a hassle?

07:17:27.540 --> 07:17:29.540
I'm going to take a bite of my waffle

07:17:29.540 --> 07:17:31.540
okay?

07:17:31.540 --> 07:17:33.540
Mmm.

07:17:41.540 --> 07:17:43.540
I know it's only like 2 cents

07:17:43.540 --> 07:17:45.540
difference. I just don't like that.

07:17:45.540 --> 07:17:47.540
Hold on.

07:17:47.540 --> 07:17:49.540
I'm going to

07:17:49.540 --> 07:17:51.540
check out

07:17:51.540 --> 07:17:53.540
Marshmallows

07:17:53.540 --> 07:17:55.540
if you'd like to send me any marshmallows

07:17:55.540 --> 07:17:57.540
I'm just going to take a quick pause champ

07:17:57.540 --> 07:17:59.540
on top of everything.

07:17:59.540 --> 07:18:01.540
Jesus Christ

07:18:01.540 --> 07:18:03.540
why do I have so many DMs?

07:18:05.540 --> 07:18:07.540
Okay

07:18:07.540 --> 07:18:09.540
I don't know

07:18:09.540 --> 07:18:11.540
for the most part.

07:18:11.540 --> 07:18:13.540
Oh and now I can't see my mouse again.

07:18:15.540 --> 07:18:17.540
Okay marshmallow refresh

07:18:17.540 --> 07:18:19.540
let's go.

07:18:21.540 --> 07:18:23.540
A lot of follow girls

07:18:23.540 --> 07:18:25.540
have 1.99 tier and then 4.99

07:18:25.540 --> 07:18:27.540
and the gift goes to the 4.99

07:18:27.540 --> 07:18:29.540
Ah

07:18:31.540 --> 07:18:33.540
I'm at exactly $5 work

07:18:33.540 --> 07:18:35.540
I possibly

07:18:45.540 --> 07:18:47.540
Hello mommy

07:18:47.540 --> 07:18:49.540
you're asking what software baby uses

07:18:49.540 --> 07:18:51.540
for 3D is called

07:18:51.540 --> 07:18:53.540
Warudo

07:18:53.540 --> 07:18:55.540
for full body tracking there's a lot of videos

07:18:55.540 --> 07:18:57.540
about it but I think most YouTubers use

07:18:57.540 --> 07:18:59.540
Sony mo copy

07:18:59.540 --> 07:19:01.540
Slime VR

07:19:01.540 --> 07:19:03.540
or Vine trackers

07:19:03.540 --> 07:19:05.540
okay okay

07:19:05.540 --> 07:19:07.540
It's okay mommy

07:19:07.540 --> 07:19:09.540
I know you can't open my last Mario link

07:19:09.540 --> 07:19:11.540
on stream don't

07:19:11.540 --> 07:19:13.540
forget to check later

07:19:13.540 --> 07:19:15.540
Is it bad that I check?

07:19:15.540 --> 07:19:17.540
As soon as I go offline

07:19:17.540 --> 07:19:19.540
I just spend like another 30 minutes

07:19:19.540 --> 07:19:21.540
and I'm like yeah

07:19:25.540 --> 07:19:27.540
what's the problem with gifting

07:19:27.540 --> 07:19:29.540
so the issue is

07:19:29.540 --> 07:19:31.540
if someone is very kind to gift

07:19:31.540 --> 07:19:33.540
but they can't dictate

07:19:33.540 --> 07:19:35.540
what type of tier to give

07:19:35.540 --> 07:19:37.540
it means

07:19:37.540 --> 07:19:39.540
outsiders isn't a nice term to use

07:19:39.540 --> 07:19:41.540
that's not the correct term

07:19:41.540 --> 07:19:43.540
but someone who

07:19:43.540 --> 07:19:45.540
maybe

07:19:47.540 --> 07:19:49.540
what's the word?

07:19:49.540 --> 07:19:51.540
I'm trying to think

07:19:51.540 --> 07:19:53.540
someone who

07:19:55.540 --> 07:19:57.540
gets access to membership streams that

07:19:57.540 --> 07:19:59.540
like should name

07:19:59.540 --> 07:20:01.540
you know like

07:20:01.540 --> 07:20:03.540
someone who's just gonna be

07:20:03.540 --> 07:20:05.540
rude about it or whatever

07:20:05.540 --> 07:20:07.540
I don't know

07:20:09.540 --> 07:20:11.540
yeah use whatever

07:20:11.540 --> 07:20:13.540
it's better to have people

07:20:13.540 --> 07:20:15.540
watching the membership streams that are

07:20:15.540 --> 07:20:17.540
actually interested

07:20:17.540 --> 07:20:19.540
because someone might get a

07:20:19.540 --> 07:20:21.540
message and it's like

07:20:21.540 --> 07:20:23.540
oh right okay

07:20:25.540 --> 07:20:27.540
that's chicken

07:20:29.540 --> 07:20:31.540
you might be able to turn on gifting

07:20:31.540 --> 07:20:33.540
entirely well the problem is gifting

07:20:33.540 --> 07:20:35.540
is a massive money source for the girls

07:20:39.540 --> 07:20:41.540
if someone's gonna be

07:20:41.540 --> 07:20:43.540
a shitter and members content

07:20:43.540 --> 07:20:45.540
they better be paying out their own pocket

07:20:45.540 --> 07:20:47.540
that's so funny I'm sorry

07:20:47.540 --> 07:20:49.540
but that's actually such a funny statement

07:20:51.540 --> 07:20:53.540
okay scrawny and fellow reeflings

07:20:53.540 --> 07:20:55.540
I'm gonna have

07:20:55.540 --> 07:20:57.540
a fun rest of the stream

07:20:57.540 --> 07:20:59.540
oh now I need to go sorry

07:20:59.540 --> 07:21:01.540
words are blending together

07:21:01.540 --> 07:21:03.540
I'll see you tomorrow yes

07:21:03.540 --> 07:21:05.540
I think it'll be roughly

07:21:05.540 --> 07:21:07.540
2 hours

07:21:07.540 --> 07:21:09.540
it's a short stream tomorrow do apologize

07:21:09.540 --> 07:21:11.540
but I'm needing overall vocal rest

07:21:11.540 --> 07:21:13.540
I've got quite a few vtuber ASMR collabs

07:21:13.540 --> 07:21:15.540
coming up so

07:21:15.540 --> 07:21:17.540
I'm needing to be a good girl and rest

07:21:17.540 --> 07:21:19.540
and try my best

07:21:19.540 --> 07:21:21.540
I am a Spanish reefling

07:21:21.540 --> 07:21:23.540
and I've been very

07:21:23.540 --> 07:21:25.540
no you've not

07:21:27.540 --> 07:21:29.540
hold on

07:21:29.540 --> 07:21:31.540
you've helped me pass some hard time

07:21:31.540 --> 07:21:33.540
so I just want to know that

07:21:33.540 --> 07:21:35.540
if you're really proud of you and the way your streams go

07:21:35.540 --> 07:21:37.540
also

07:21:37.540 --> 07:21:39.540
I like how you act

07:21:39.540 --> 07:21:41.540
on stream

07:21:41.540 --> 07:21:43.540
about gapping and ranking burps is fun

07:21:45.540 --> 07:21:47.540
what is

07:21:47.540 --> 07:21:49.540
what do you want in Spanish

07:21:49.540 --> 07:21:51.540
in English

07:21:51.540 --> 07:21:53.540
for me

07:21:53.540 --> 07:21:55.540
because I don't know what

07:21:55.540 --> 07:21:57.540
what do you want

07:21:57.540 --> 07:21:59.540
I think it means

07:21:59.540 --> 07:22:01.540
I don't even know

07:22:05.540 --> 07:22:07.540
you are truly an anomaly

07:22:07.540 --> 07:22:09.540
I've never seen someone who is

07:22:09.540 --> 07:22:11.540
so intensely thoughtful

07:22:11.540 --> 07:22:13.540
and caring about both

07:22:13.540 --> 07:22:15.540
your daughters and reeflings

07:22:15.540 --> 07:22:17.540
also shameless

07:22:17.540 --> 07:22:19.540
hold on

07:22:19.540 --> 07:22:21.540
what am I getting spanked by

07:22:21.540 --> 07:22:23.540
it's a level of

07:22:23.540 --> 07:22:25.540
authenticity

07:22:25.540 --> 07:22:27.540
I would never

07:22:27.540 --> 07:22:29.540
even see in a person let alone a vtuber

07:22:29.540 --> 07:22:31.540
I wish you all the success in the world

07:22:31.540 --> 07:22:33.540
wow

07:22:33.540 --> 07:22:35.540
you did an absolutely fantastic job

07:22:35.540 --> 07:22:37.540
on the tryharding in the ASMR stream

07:22:37.540 --> 07:22:39.540
I can only assume you have a really good coach

07:22:39.540 --> 07:22:41.540
since it took me over a year to study to get to that level

07:22:41.540 --> 07:22:43.540
a coach

07:22:43.540 --> 07:22:45.540
like a hypno coach

07:22:45.540 --> 07:22:47.540
no

07:22:47.540 --> 07:22:49.540
that's just called autism

07:22:49.540 --> 07:22:51.540
and general interest

07:22:51.540 --> 07:22:53.540
I just apply what I like to whatever

07:22:53.540 --> 07:22:55.540
and I do it my

07:22:55.540 --> 07:22:57.540
also it's something I would never do otherwise

07:22:57.540 --> 07:22:59.540
but my

07:22:59.540 --> 07:23:01.540
but my girlfriend

07:23:01.540 --> 07:23:03.540
has convinced me I should

07:23:03.540 --> 07:23:05.540
do bibbutes

07:23:05.540 --> 07:23:07.540
so I printed out 21 pages

07:23:07.540 --> 07:23:09.540
so I can build some

07:23:09.540 --> 07:23:11.540
additional cognitive habits

07:23:11.540 --> 07:23:13.540
at the end of the month

07:23:13.540 --> 07:23:15.540
what is this

07:23:23.540 --> 07:23:25.540
what is this

07:23:25.540 --> 07:23:27.540
what is this

07:23:27.540 --> 07:23:29.540
what is this

07:23:29.540 --> 07:23:31.540
additional cognitive habits

07:23:31.540 --> 07:23:33.540
what is this

07:23:35.540 --> 07:23:37.540
21 bibbutes for me

07:23:37.540 --> 07:23:39.540
for me

07:23:39.540 --> 07:23:41.540
right now

07:23:41.540 --> 07:23:43.540
it's almost 5am

07:23:43.540 --> 07:23:45.540
yes please rest well

07:23:45.540 --> 07:23:47.540
for those of you who are hanging on by a thread

07:23:47.540 --> 07:23:49.540
we're

07:23:49.540 --> 07:23:51.540
just going to start off the dark brotherhood

07:23:51.540 --> 07:23:53.540
at this point

07:23:53.540 --> 07:23:55.540
I'm going to see if I can fix achievements

07:23:55.540 --> 07:23:57.540
and possibly we can come back to Skyrim

07:23:57.540 --> 07:23:59.540
but tomorrow is being steamrolled

07:23:59.540 --> 07:24:01.540
by monetization celebration stream

07:24:01.540 --> 07:24:03.540
go get those

07:24:03.540 --> 07:24:05.540
microplastics out of you somehow

07:24:05.540 --> 07:24:07.540
honestly

07:24:09.540 --> 07:24:11.540
hey lassie

07:24:11.540 --> 07:24:13.540
would you kindly read some modellups

07:24:13.540 --> 07:24:15.540
so you can see more of the girlies

07:24:15.540 --> 07:24:17.540
you can zoom out a bit too if you don't want to block too much of the game

07:24:19.540 --> 07:24:21.540
someone said they don't like it

07:24:23.540 --> 07:24:25.540
where is it

07:24:25.540 --> 07:24:27.540
I would have to go like this

07:24:31.540 --> 07:24:33.540
does this work hold on

07:24:33.540 --> 07:24:35.540
does that work

07:24:35.540 --> 07:24:37.540
it does work

07:24:39.540 --> 07:24:41.540
that's terrible

07:24:43.540 --> 07:24:45.540
I can't really

07:24:45.540 --> 07:24:47.540
can't really get away with it too much

07:24:47.540 --> 07:24:49.540
let's behave

07:24:51.540 --> 07:24:53.540
a tomato a day keeps your bars okay

07:24:53.540 --> 07:24:55.540
yes that is our new slogan

07:24:55.540 --> 07:24:57.540
ladies and gentlemen

07:24:57.540 --> 07:24:59.540
tomato a day keeps your bar health

07:24:59.540 --> 07:25:01.540
okay

07:25:01.540 --> 07:25:03.540
I'm still trying to eat the same strip waffle

07:25:03.540 --> 07:25:05.540
I'm getting so distracted

07:25:05.540 --> 07:25:07.540
so when is the audio of you rambling about

07:25:07.540 --> 07:25:09.540
Assassin's Creed or something

07:25:09.540 --> 07:25:11.540
well getting your

07:25:11.540 --> 07:25:13.540
what is this guy

07:25:13.540 --> 07:25:15.540
oh my god you guys are getting our while

07:25:15.540 --> 07:25:17.540
I'm actually doing a

07:25:17.540 --> 07:25:19.540
review

07:25:19.540 --> 07:25:21.540
on

07:25:21.540 --> 07:25:23.540
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

07:25:23.540 --> 07:25:25.540
which should come out around November

07:25:25.540 --> 07:25:27.540
like I'm doing an actual game review footage

07:25:27.540 --> 07:25:29.540
like I'm being so serious on it

07:25:29.540 --> 07:25:31.540
so if you like hearing my accent

07:25:31.540 --> 07:25:33.540
putting you to sleep well I can tell you

07:25:33.540 --> 07:25:35.540
about Assassin's Creed and how amazing it is

07:25:37.540 --> 07:25:39.540
sometimes I wish

07:25:39.540 --> 07:25:41.540
we could see the film they're

07:25:41.540 --> 07:25:43.540
they're pretty outrageous I'm trying my best

07:25:43.540 --> 07:25:45.540
to like dart around them

07:25:45.540 --> 07:25:47.540
but good night rest well those who need to rest

07:25:47.540 --> 07:25:49.540
we love strongers the cuttlefish

07:25:49.540 --> 07:25:51.540
in this house

07:25:53.540 --> 07:25:55.540
strongy if you like being in games

07:25:55.540 --> 07:25:57.540
kind of reckon Valhalla is such a

07:25:57.540 --> 07:25:59.540
good game and I think you'll like it

07:25:59.540 --> 07:26:01.540
I most certainly will check that out

07:26:01.540 --> 07:26:03.540
I may have in another life thought I was

07:26:03.540 --> 07:26:05.540
about to play it and then play the complete

07:26:05.540 --> 07:26:07.540
wrong game which was called Helltaker I believe

07:26:07.540 --> 07:26:09.540
and it was also a puzzle game and

07:26:09.540 --> 07:26:11.540
I was so confused on why the game

07:26:11.540 --> 07:26:13.540
looked so different to what I was playing

07:26:13.540 --> 07:26:15.540
and it turns out I was playing the completely wrong

07:26:15.540 --> 07:26:17.540
game but yes I would

07:26:17.540 --> 07:26:19.540
love to give Valhalla a try

07:26:19.540 --> 07:26:21.540
hi cuttles are Mondays and Tuesdays

07:26:21.540 --> 07:26:23.540
always going to be endurance

07:26:23.540 --> 07:26:25.540
uh

07:26:25.540 --> 07:26:27.540
no

07:26:27.540 --> 07:26:29.540
they are not

07:26:29.540 --> 07:26:31.540
it's just a

07:26:31.540 --> 07:26:33.540
a quinky dink really that I put it on Monday and Tuesday

07:26:33.540 --> 07:26:35.540
but no they're not always going to be the endurance on those days

07:26:35.540 --> 07:26:37.540
um

07:26:37.540 --> 07:26:39.540
yes

07:26:45.540 --> 07:26:47.540
having you you have about to

07:26:47.540 --> 07:26:49.540
squid me right now by the Pope

07:26:49.540 --> 07:26:51.540
hey strongy I am back

07:26:51.540 --> 07:26:53.540
I know you were wondering how to pronounce

07:26:53.540 --> 07:26:55.540
my name earlier and you had

07:26:55.540 --> 07:26:57.540
it right as spiny is pronounced

07:26:57.540 --> 07:26:59.540
like a spiny anteater

07:27:01.540 --> 07:27:03.540
I'm going to be so honest

07:27:03.540 --> 07:27:05.540
Brian did not help with my confusion

07:27:05.540 --> 07:27:07.540
on the pronunciation of your name

07:27:07.540 --> 07:27:09.540
tiny spiny

07:27:09.540 --> 07:27:11.540
what

07:27:11.540 --> 07:27:13.540
and you had it right as spiny

07:27:13.540 --> 07:27:15.540
is pronounced pronounced like a spiny

07:27:15.540 --> 07:27:17.540
anteater a spiny

07:27:17.540 --> 07:27:19.540
anteater or a

07:27:19.540 --> 07:27:21.540
spiny anteater

07:27:23.540 --> 07:27:25.540
Brian just made that 10

07:27:25.540 --> 07:27:27.540
times worse and I do apologize if I'm

07:27:27.540 --> 07:27:29.540
now officially butchering it but thank you for the tip

07:27:29.540 --> 07:27:31.540
do it

07:27:31.540 --> 07:27:33.540
phonetically in chat like

07:27:33.540 --> 07:27:35.540
right so it's either

07:27:35.540 --> 07:27:37.540
spiny

07:27:37.540 --> 07:27:39.540
or did I even

07:27:39.540 --> 07:27:41.540
spiny

07:27:41.540 --> 07:27:43.540
so you know

07:27:43.540 --> 07:27:45.540
spain

07:27:45.540 --> 07:27:47.540
e okay

07:27:47.540 --> 07:27:49.540
spiny

07:27:49.540 --> 07:27:51.540
we got there in the end

07:27:51.540 --> 07:27:53.540
literally I'm renaming everyone who

07:27:53.540 --> 07:27:55.540
who just doesn't have an easy to rename

07:27:55.540 --> 07:27:57.540
for me

07:27:57.540 --> 07:27:59.540
spiny

07:27:59.540 --> 07:28:01.540
there are

07:28:01.540 --> 07:28:03.540
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday

07:28:03.540 --> 07:28:05.540
endurance streams yes

07:28:05.540 --> 07:28:07.540
um most of the stream sniping

07:28:07.540 --> 07:28:09.540
I'm trying to do for like a big amount

07:28:09.540 --> 07:28:11.540
of time because I know not everyone's available

07:28:11.540 --> 07:28:13.540
right at the one

07:28:13.540 --> 07:28:15.540
time zone if you will

07:28:15.540 --> 07:28:17.540
uh

07:28:17.540 --> 07:28:19.540
yeah

07:28:21.540 --> 07:28:23.540
having you you have about developmental

07:28:23.540 --> 07:28:25.540
psychology and socially

07:28:25.540 --> 07:28:27.540
inculcated

07:28:27.540 --> 07:28:29.540
reactions

07:28:29.540 --> 07:28:31.540
to stress maybe realize I really wish that physical

07:28:31.540 --> 07:28:33.540
touch and infection was more normalized in society

07:28:33.540 --> 07:28:35.540
especially for men male socialized people

07:28:35.540 --> 07:28:37.540
people need more hugs easy also

07:28:37.540 --> 07:28:39.540
I'm curious how you deal with the stress and she mentioned

07:28:39.540 --> 07:28:41.540
you don't know how we do it

07:28:41.540 --> 07:28:43.540
um

07:28:43.540 --> 07:28:45.540
I always

07:28:45.540 --> 07:28:47.540
have a goal or something to work towards

07:28:47.540 --> 07:28:49.540
which helps distract me

07:28:49.540 --> 07:28:51.540
from what I'm feeling in the moment

07:28:51.540 --> 07:28:53.540
and essentially makes me like numb

07:28:53.540 --> 07:28:55.540
and work through it

07:28:55.540 --> 07:28:57.540
so like right now my goal is to help the girls

07:28:57.540 --> 07:28:59.540
achieve what they want

07:28:59.540 --> 07:29:01.540
so I'm like even though

07:29:01.540 --> 07:29:03.540
I'm stressed

07:29:03.540 --> 07:29:05.540
and I'm worried and I'm this and I'm

07:29:05.540 --> 07:29:07.540
that because

07:29:07.540 --> 07:29:09.540
they are a much more important

07:29:09.540 --> 07:29:11.540
focus on my life

07:29:11.540 --> 07:29:13.540
it's kind of one of those things where I can

07:29:13.540 --> 07:29:15.540
just put it to the side for now

07:29:15.540 --> 07:29:17.540
and right okay

07:29:17.540 --> 07:29:19.540
what's next once I get

07:29:19.540 --> 07:29:21.540
offline I have some lovely VTubers

07:29:21.540 --> 07:29:23.540
who are waiting on an ASMR collab from me

07:29:23.540 --> 07:29:25.540
I have to send away shorts

07:29:25.540 --> 07:29:27.540
for the girls I need to record that for them

07:29:27.540 --> 07:29:29.540
um

07:29:29.540 --> 07:29:31.540
like I need to do

07:29:31.540 --> 07:29:33.540
um

07:29:33.540 --> 07:29:35.540
yeah

07:29:35.540 --> 07:29:37.540
um

07:29:37.540 --> 07:29:39.540
every word is hard

07:29:39.540 --> 07:29:41.540
to pronounce if you're bad enough for example

07:29:41.540 --> 07:29:43.540
I pronounce spatula spatula

07:29:43.540 --> 07:29:45.540
honestly

07:29:45.540 --> 07:29:47.540
I think having

07:29:47.540 --> 07:29:49.540
a purpose is really useful

07:29:49.540 --> 07:29:51.540
in general yes I agree with that

07:29:51.540 --> 07:29:53.540
I also do it that way

07:29:53.540 --> 07:29:55.540
it's so tough to tackle

07:29:55.540 --> 07:29:57.540
like men's socialization

07:29:57.540 --> 07:29:59.540
because

07:29:59.540 --> 07:30:01.540
where does it start it starts in the

07:30:01.540 --> 07:30:03.540
home but then where

07:30:03.540 --> 07:30:05.540
does it get affected

07:30:05.540 --> 07:30:07.540
secondary socialization at school

07:30:07.540 --> 07:30:09.540
like I don't know if you guys had this

07:30:09.540 --> 07:30:11.540
but in Scotland

07:30:11.540 --> 07:30:13.540
um

07:30:13.540 --> 07:30:15.540
like

07:30:15.540 --> 07:30:17.540
it became so quickly oh that's gay

07:30:17.540 --> 07:30:19.540
to show any affection

07:30:19.540 --> 07:30:21.540
in any sense in a basic

07:30:21.540 --> 07:30:23.540
hug a basic handshake

07:30:23.540 --> 07:30:25.540
um rubbing shoulders

07:30:25.540 --> 07:30:27.540
against each other if you're both

07:30:27.540 --> 07:30:29.540
you get you get and it starts

07:30:29.540 --> 07:30:31.540
from there and then that isolation

07:30:31.540 --> 07:30:33.540
progresses

07:30:33.540 --> 07:30:35.540
further and further to the point

07:30:35.540 --> 07:30:37.540
where the most

07:30:37.540 --> 07:30:39.540
natural thing which is a reassuring

07:30:39.540 --> 07:30:41.540
hug or embrace when you meet someone

07:30:41.540 --> 07:30:43.540
you know um

07:30:43.540 --> 07:30:45.540
becomes this almost

07:30:45.540 --> 07:30:47.540
taboo unfamiliar

07:30:47.540 --> 07:30:49.540
territory um

07:30:49.540 --> 07:30:51.540
and it is such a shame that you even have

07:30:51.540 --> 07:30:53.540
to experience that because

07:30:53.540 --> 07:30:55.540
of the secondary socialization

07:30:55.540 --> 07:30:57.540
because your primary socialization which is your family

07:30:57.540 --> 07:30:59.540
um

07:30:59.540 --> 07:31:01.540
you know I bet your dad came home and you gave him

07:31:01.540 --> 07:31:03.540
a big hug like oh dad

07:31:03.540 --> 07:31:05.540
and when you went and visited your grandparents

07:31:05.540 --> 07:31:07.540
oh granddad grand

07:31:07.540 --> 07:31:09.540
and gave him a wee kiss and a wee hug and all that

07:31:09.540 --> 07:31:11.540
and it all goes out

07:31:11.540 --> 07:31:13.540
the window because of

07:31:13.540 --> 07:31:15.540
secondary socialization

07:31:15.540 --> 07:31:17.540
yet behind closed doors

07:31:17.540 --> 07:31:19.540
behind closed doors behind

07:31:19.540 --> 07:31:21.540
in families perfectly normal

07:31:21.540 --> 07:31:23.540
absolutely normal behavior

07:31:23.540 --> 07:31:25.540
and it's very frustrating

07:31:25.540 --> 07:31:27.540
because

07:31:27.540 --> 07:31:29.540
to even think of how to

07:31:29.540 --> 07:31:31.540
tackle it where do you

07:31:31.540 --> 07:31:33.540
even start

07:31:33.540 --> 07:31:35.540
because the way

07:31:35.540 --> 07:31:37.540
it's set up is it's your

07:31:37.540 --> 07:31:39.540
fault on an individual

07:31:39.540 --> 07:31:41.540
level that you can

07:31:41.540 --> 07:31:43.540
do these things that you can't hug

07:31:43.540 --> 07:31:45.540
your bro that you get you meet up with once a month

07:31:45.540 --> 07:31:47.540
um you can

07:31:47.540 --> 07:31:49.540
it's your fault

07:31:49.540 --> 07:31:51.540
because you didn't keep up

07:31:51.540 --> 07:31:53.540
with that societal norm you

07:31:53.540 --> 07:31:55.540
didn't break the more you like see how

07:31:55.540 --> 07:31:57.540
it's so hard to break from society's grasp

07:31:57.540 --> 07:31:59.540
at that point

07:31:59.540 --> 07:32:01.540
someone says how's the game going

07:32:01.540 --> 07:32:03.540
I'm so sorry I'm currently in a rant

07:32:03.540 --> 07:32:05.540
about the social

07:32:05.540 --> 07:32:07.540
um

07:32:07.540 --> 07:32:09.540
education that you get after

07:32:09.540 --> 07:32:11.540
sorry I'm fricking going on a rant again I can't

07:32:11.540 --> 07:32:13.540
I can't stop myself

07:32:13.540 --> 07:32:15.540
it's fascinating stuff when you start to really

07:32:15.540 --> 07:32:17.540
break it down it becomes

07:32:17.540 --> 07:32:19.540
almost frustrating

07:32:19.540 --> 07:32:21.540
when you realize how bare bones

07:32:21.540 --> 07:32:23.540
and simplistic humans are in nature

07:32:23.540 --> 07:32:25.540
and yet we are

07:32:25.540 --> 07:32:27.540
sorry I'm burping away

07:32:27.540 --> 07:32:29.540
we are our own biggest enemies

07:32:29.540 --> 07:32:31.540
we live in a society

07:32:31.540 --> 07:32:33.540
literally

07:32:33.540 --> 07:32:35.540
I'm typing that too

07:32:35.540 --> 07:32:37.540
we live

07:32:37.540 --> 07:32:39.540
we live in our society

07:32:39.540 --> 07:32:41.540
that's it I'm typing that in chat

07:32:41.540 --> 07:32:43.540
that's me getting it out there we live in our society

07:32:43.540 --> 07:32:45.540
get that out

07:32:45.540 --> 07:32:47.540
get that off your chest you're welcome to type

07:32:47.540 --> 07:32:49.540
we live in a society as well in chat

07:32:49.540 --> 07:32:51.540
to get it off your chest because

07:32:51.540 --> 07:32:53.540
we do live in a society

07:32:53.540 --> 07:32:55.540
we live in a society

07:32:55.540 --> 07:32:57.540
therapy stream when

07:32:57.540 --> 07:32:59.540
oh I'm not sure I can do that

07:32:59.540 --> 07:33:01.540
Mercy's actually doing

07:33:01.540 --> 07:33:03.540
a like

07:33:03.540 --> 07:33:05.540
terrible therapy advice stream

07:33:05.540 --> 07:33:07.540
yeah yeah we truly do live in a society

07:33:07.540 --> 07:33:09.540
um

07:33:09.540 --> 07:33:11.540
wait yes

07:33:11.540 --> 07:33:13.540
um

07:33:13.540 --> 07:33:15.540
wait yes

07:33:15.540 --> 07:33:17.540
that um

07:33:17.540 --> 07:33:19.540
sorry I just read that refling

07:33:19.540 --> 07:33:21.540
that was like your toes did everything for me

07:33:21.540 --> 07:33:23.540
and I'm like hi you're welcome

07:33:25.540 --> 07:33:27.540
after this stream tonight

07:33:27.540 --> 07:33:29.540
with all the conspiracy talk

07:33:29.540 --> 07:33:31.540
I need you to do conspiracy theory

07:33:31.540 --> 07:33:33.540
talking stream with Pippa it would be incredible

07:33:33.540 --> 07:33:35.540
love your yapping

07:33:35.540 --> 07:33:37.540
just can't wait to get enough of the adorable cut of it

07:33:37.540 --> 07:33:39.540
oh I don't know if I would go too far

07:33:39.540 --> 07:33:41.540
I've not had a chance to watch Pippa's content in a very long time

07:33:41.540 --> 07:33:43.540
um

07:33:43.540 --> 07:33:45.540
but I don't know if I would go too far

07:33:45.540 --> 07:33:47.540
and I'm like

07:33:47.540 --> 07:33:49.540
um

07:33:49.540 --> 07:33:51.540
my ideas are quite

07:33:51.540 --> 07:33:53.540
alienating

07:33:53.540 --> 07:33:55.540
as much as we were meming on needy streamer overload

07:33:55.540 --> 07:33:57.540
um

07:33:57.540 --> 07:33:59.540
my

07:33:59.540 --> 07:34:01.540
I know you're not really supposed to talk about any of that

07:34:01.540 --> 07:34:03.540
you're supposed to be like tihi

07:34:03.540 --> 07:34:05.540
but yeah I'm thinking you're never know

07:34:05.540 --> 07:34:07.540
I plan on writing

07:34:07.540 --> 07:34:09.540
a fairly long

07:34:09.540 --> 07:34:11.540
fantasy of mine

07:34:11.540 --> 07:34:13.540
I've had of you it's still cringe I want to

07:34:13.540 --> 07:34:15.540
write it though as I was extremely pent up

07:34:15.540 --> 07:34:17.540
after you do it

07:34:17.540 --> 07:34:19.540
is pace been fine for this yes

07:34:19.540 --> 07:34:21.540
I recommend it

07:34:21.540 --> 07:34:23.540
oh no strong is a moon truth

07:34:23.540 --> 07:34:25.540
oh god what's that I don't even know what that is

07:34:25.540 --> 07:34:27.540
I don't know how I don't know if I'd go too far

07:34:27.540 --> 07:34:29.540
she says when talking about the yabba

07:34:29.540 --> 07:34:31.540
okay okay okay

07:34:31.540 --> 07:34:33.540
it would be a race to see who will go too far

07:34:33.540 --> 07:34:35.540
you're a Pippa

07:34:37.540 --> 07:34:39.540
I'm like I'm probably

07:34:39.540 --> 07:34:41.540
1984 dystopian

07:34:41.540 --> 07:34:43.540
type

07:34:43.540 --> 07:34:45.540
allegations

07:34:45.540 --> 07:34:47.540
I don't know what

07:34:47.540 --> 07:34:49.540
Pippa's field is in particular

07:34:49.540 --> 07:34:51.540
but I am dystopian

07:34:51.540 --> 07:34:53.540
based like whatever horrors of

07:34:53.540 --> 07:34:55.540
man-made comprehension you can think of

07:34:55.540 --> 07:34:57.540
have occurred

07:34:57.540 --> 07:34:59.540
you know I'm like that kind of side of things

07:34:59.540 --> 07:35:01.540
can you see

07:35:01.540 --> 07:35:03.540
can you please say in the thickest island accent

07:35:05.540 --> 07:35:07.540
eh

07:35:07.540 --> 07:35:09.540
I cast

07:35:09.540 --> 07:35:11.540
tongue positional awareness

07:35:11.540 --> 07:35:13.540
sorry that's a really rough accent

07:35:13.540 --> 07:35:15.540
but there you go

07:35:15.540 --> 07:35:17.540
what's your favourite, Pringle's favourite

07:35:17.540 --> 07:35:19.540
uh

07:35:19.540 --> 07:35:21.540
paprika I love Pippa

07:35:21.540 --> 07:35:23.540
Pippa is there and lizards are in government

07:35:23.540 --> 07:35:25.540
literally 1984

07:35:25.540 --> 07:35:27.540
Shawnee calls

07:35:27.540 --> 07:35:29.540
yeah

07:35:29.540 --> 07:35:31.540
Pippa is just psycho

07:35:31.540 --> 07:35:33.540
she'll be, she'll go way too far quicker

07:35:33.540 --> 07:35:35.540
okay

07:35:35.540 --> 07:35:37.540
well we shouldn't egg her on how about we just

07:35:37.540 --> 07:35:39.540
leave this as

07:35:39.540 --> 07:35:41.540
eh

07:35:41.540 --> 07:35:43.540
moon truth or believes the moon is a hologram

07:35:43.540 --> 07:35:45.540
is the conspiracy theory made up to clown on

07:35:45.540 --> 07:35:47.540
eh

07:35:47.540 --> 07:35:49.540
that people actually started well

07:35:49.540 --> 07:35:51.540
well

07:35:51.540 --> 07:35:53.540
I have terrible news I'm afraid I don't meet much

07:35:53.540 --> 07:35:55.540
of the requirements of a conspiracy theorist

07:35:55.540 --> 07:35:57.540
eh I'm afraid that yes

07:35:57.540 --> 07:35:59.540
our planet is in fact

07:35:59.540 --> 07:36:01.540
around, oh dear

07:36:01.540 --> 07:36:03.540
very controversial I know

07:36:03.540 --> 07:36:05.540
it's okay it's okay you can unsubscribe

07:36:05.540 --> 07:36:07.540
unsubscribe

07:36:07.540 --> 07:36:09.540
at least it's not far and high

07:36:09.540 --> 07:36:11.540
four five one yet right

07:36:11.540 --> 07:36:13.540
oh

07:36:13.540 --> 07:36:15.540
oh

07:36:15.540 --> 07:36:17.540
yeah

07:36:17.540 --> 07:36:19.540
yeah far and high four five one

07:36:19.540 --> 07:36:21.540
yeah

07:36:21.540 --> 07:36:23.540
what happens if the reason

07:36:23.540 --> 07:36:25.540
why um

07:36:25.540 --> 07:36:27.540
a lot of media

07:36:27.540 --> 07:36:29.540
before

07:36:29.540 --> 07:36:31.540
a certain year

07:36:31.540 --> 07:36:33.540
was kind of scrubbed on a mass level

07:36:33.540 --> 07:36:35.540
is so people realise

07:36:35.540 --> 07:36:37.540
eh people don't know that

07:36:37.540 --> 07:36:39.540
in a few hundred years I try to get a sense of that

07:36:39.540 --> 07:36:41.540
we live in a society

07:36:41.540 --> 07:36:43.540
where I go into the darkest and most remote

07:36:43.540 --> 07:36:45.540
German forest and someone

07:36:45.540 --> 07:36:47.540
still reports me because I pee

07:36:47.540 --> 07:36:49.540
against a tree

07:36:49.540 --> 07:36:51.540
true iron reaver true

07:36:51.540 --> 07:36:53.540
right imagine burning books

07:36:53.540 --> 07:36:55.540
ah ha ha ha ha

07:36:55.540 --> 07:36:57.540
you're a round aether

07:36:57.540 --> 07:36:59.540
unsubbed I can't believe it

07:36:59.540 --> 07:37:01.540
the moon round

07:37:01.540 --> 07:37:03.540
the sun round

07:37:03.540 --> 07:37:05.540
the earth on a turtle's back

07:37:05.540 --> 07:37:07.540
and world of warcraft

07:37:07.540 --> 07:37:09.540
that's all I'm saying

07:37:09.540 --> 07:37:11.540
the earth is round

07:37:11.540 --> 07:37:13.540
oh wait isn't it not like a

07:37:13.540 --> 07:37:15.540
there's like a certain name because it's like

07:37:15.540 --> 07:37:17.540
a wonky round and not a perfect round

07:37:17.540 --> 07:37:19.540
ah

07:37:19.540 --> 07:37:21.540
something like that

07:37:23.540 --> 07:37:25.540
uh have I shared any bibboots

07:37:25.540 --> 07:37:27.540
I actually don't

07:37:27.540 --> 07:37:29.540
share them with the girls

07:37:29.540 --> 07:37:31.540
um

07:37:31.540 --> 07:37:33.540
just because

07:37:33.540 --> 07:37:35.540
I've I don't know

07:37:35.540 --> 07:37:37.540
I just it's never really occurred to me to do

07:37:37.540 --> 07:37:39.540
such a thing

07:37:39.540 --> 07:37:41.540
an oval lumpy ball yeah

07:37:41.540 --> 07:37:43.540
lumpy ball remember to check

07:37:43.540 --> 07:37:45.540
your balls regularly

07:37:45.540 --> 07:37:47.540
and if you find the lump

07:37:47.540 --> 07:37:49.540
get it checked out

07:37:49.540 --> 07:37:51.540
ladies and gentlemen

07:37:51.540 --> 07:37:53.540
and before you go

07:37:53.540 --> 07:37:55.540
it's embarrassing I assure you

07:37:55.540 --> 07:37:57.540
the person who is doing the ultrasound

07:37:57.540 --> 07:37:59.540
on your boss act has already

07:37:59.540 --> 07:38:01.540
looked at about 10 sacks

07:38:01.540 --> 07:38:03.540
that day already and within

07:38:03.540 --> 07:38:05.540
that week has probably seen over a hundred

07:38:05.540 --> 07:38:07.540
I assure you

07:38:07.540 --> 07:38:09.540
your resticles raggy are not that

07:38:09.540 --> 07:38:11.540
unique okay get yourself

07:38:11.540 --> 07:38:13.540
checked out if you are worried

07:38:13.540 --> 07:38:15.540
an ultrasound

07:38:15.540 --> 07:38:17.540
yeah that's what they do against your

07:38:17.540 --> 07:38:19.540
um

07:38:19.540 --> 07:38:21.540
if you have a bump you get an ultrasound

07:38:21.540 --> 07:38:23.540
on your

07:38:23.540 --> 07:38:25.540
resticle raggy

07:38:25.540 --> 07:38:27.540
that's not the thing

07:38:27.540 --> 07:38:29.540
is it not an ultrasound I checked

07:38:29.540 --> 07:38:31.540
I'm clear oh I mean if you want to

07:38:31.540 --> 07:38:33.540
I mean we could check live if you

07:38:35.540 --> 07:38:37.540
wow I zoomed through the backlog at two

07:38:37.540 --> 07:38:39.540
times speed after hearing

07:38:39.540 --> 07:38:41.540
back where you read my marrow

07:38:41.540 --> 07:38:43.540
but my raggy

07:38:43.540 --> 07:38:45.540
sacks

07:38:45.540 --> 07:38:47.540
I found a lump

07:38:47.540 --> 07:38:49.540
and they have no idea what it is some things can be

07:38:49.540 --> 07:38:51.540
completely benign like

07:38:51.540 --> 07:38:53.540
you know we all come out a bit wonky

07:38:53.540 --> 07:38:55.540
can you come out 100% a perfect specimen

07:38:55.540 --> 07:38:57.540
now

07:38:57.540 --> 07:38:59.540
it's definitely thing had me balls

07:38:59.540 --> 07:39:01.540
just sounded clear okay

07:39:01.540 --> 07:39:03.540
as long as you're clear

07:39:03.540 --> 07:39:05.540
if you really want to yeah right

07:39:05.540 --> 07:39:07.540
okay everyone follow my okay

07:39:07.540 --> 07:39:09.540
do your hands have calluses

07:39:09.540 --> 07:39:11.540
rougher smooth feet question mark

07:39:11.540 --> 07:39:13.540
um I have what's called

07:39:13.540 --> 07:39:15.540
hyper hydrosis

07:39:15.540 --> 07:39:17.540
um especially in my feet

07:39:17.540 --> 07:39:19.540
and I do have it in my hands

07:39:19.540 --> 07:39:21.540
um which means my hands

07:39:21.540 --> 07:39:23.540
are always very smooth

07:39:23.540 --> 07:39:25.540
um I have no dryness

07:39:25.540 --> 07:39:27.540
because I am constantly

07:39:27.540 --> 07:39:29.540
wet

07:39:29.540 --> 07:39:31.540
really there's nothing else

07:39:31.540 --> 07:39:33.540
to go off by um

07:39:33.540 --> 07:39:35.540
but yes I always have like kind of moist

07:39:35.540 --> 07:39:37.540
hands

07:39:37.540 --> 07:39:39.540
um so they're always soft and so are my feet

07:39:39.540 --> 07:39:41.540
are incredibly soft so yeah

07:39:41.540 --> 07:39:43.540
there you go now you know

07:39:43.540 --> 07:39:45.540
I was actually

07:39:45.540 --> 07:39:47.540
going to do a donut on reward where

07:39:47.540 --> 07:39:49.540
I give the like

07:39:49.540 --> 07:39:51.540
for a second and third place like

07:39:51.540 --> 07:39:53.540
high highs that I've worn but obviously

07:39:53.540 --> 07:39:55.540
with my sweaty feet

07:39:55.540 --> 07:39:57.540
constantly wet they're not like dripping

07:39:57.540 --> 07:39:59.540
not dripping I don't need

07:39:59.540 --> 07:40:01.540
Botox if you didn't know Botox

07:40:01.540 --> 07:40:03.540
will paralyze the

07:40:03.540 --> 07:40:05.540
sweat cells um

07:40:05.540 --> 07:40:07.540
but they are constantly

07:40:07.540 --> 07:40:09.540
having like a

07:40:11.540 --> 07:40:13.540
they're not dry put it that way

07:40:13.540 --> 07:40:15.540
most guys hands are like dry so

07:40:15.540 --> 07:40:17.540
when you go like when you

07:40:17.540 --> 07:40:19.540
rub your hands together it's like

07:40:19.540 --> 07:40:21.540
but when I rub my hands well when I put

07:40:21.540 --> 07:40:23.540
my hands together I can fart with my hands

07:40:23.540 --> 07:40:25.540
because they're always

07:40:25.540 --> 07:40:27.540
clammy and wet and yeah

07:40:27.540 --> 07:40:29.540
that's very true

07:40:29.540 --> 07:40:31.540
I can always do that

07:40:31.540 --> 07:40:33.540
do it on command

07:40:33.540 --> 07:40:35.540
I can never find this emote it's called flushed

07:40:35.540 --> 07:40:37.540
that emote is called flushed

07:40:37.540 --> 07:40:39.540
I can do that

07:40:39.540 --> 07:40:41.540
breathe it in lads and lasses

07:40:41.540 --> 07:40:43.540
well you are a cuddle fish I'd be concerned

07:40:43.540 --> 07:40:45.540
if you were tonight you're so talented

07:40:45.540 --> 07:40:47.540
sweaty hands aren't fun

07:40:47.540 --> 07:40:49.540
it's a little bit annoying especially

07:40:49.540 --> 07:40:51.540
gaming with a controller

07:40:51.540 --> 07:40:53.540
because of the heat

07:40:53.540 --> 07:40:55.540
transfer it reflects straight back

07:40:55.540 --> 07:40:57.540
when I'm using a controller

07:40:57.540 --> 07:40:59.540
fart hands being

07:40:59.540 --> 07:41:01.540
when your hands are dry just hold

07:41:01.540 --> 07:41:03.540
shiny I will I have

07:41:03.540 --> 07:41:05.540
enough sweat to make your hands

07:41:05.540 --> 07:41:07.540
nice and soft as well okay

07:41:07.540 --> 07:41:09.540
there's enough to go around I assure you

07:41:17.540 --> 07:41:19.540
but yeah

07:41:21.540 --> 07:41:23.540
don't read this out loud

07:41:27.540 --> 07:41:29.540
oh my god I'm getting intel

07:41:29.540 --> 07:41:31.540
I'm getting intel

07:41:31.540 --> 07:41:33.540
I know you said

07:41:33.540 --> 07:41:35.540
you wouldn't ever approach other v-tubers

07:41:35.540 --> 07:41:37.540
but considering the similarity of line of work

07:41:37.540 --> 07:41:39.540
would you ever consider a collab with project melody

07:41:39.540 --> 07:41:41.540
both of you seem very knowledgeable

07:41:41.540 --> 07:41:43.540
and passionate about

07:41:43.540 --> 07:41:45.540
positive A in education mental health

07:41:45.540 --> 07:41:47.540
I feel like you would be great for us

07:41:49.540 --> 07:41:51.540
I would never say no

07:41:51.540 --> 07:41:53.540
but at this point in time

07:41:55.540 --> 07:41:57.540
I'm just going to focus on getting the girls

07:41:57.540 --> 07:41:59.540
their achievements stuff

07:41:59.540 --> 07:42:01.540
I would never say no

07:42:01.540 --> 07:42:03.540
but to reach out is quite

07:42:03.540 --> 07:42:05.540
daunting

07:42:05.540 --> 07:42:07.540
I'm sure anyone can kind of relate to that kind of thing

07:42:11.540 --> 07:42:13.540
I would never say no

07:42:13.540 --> 07:42:15.540
I've just said that

07:42:15.540 --> 07:42:17.540
main project melody seems to be

07:42:17.540 --> 07:42:19.540
like opposites

07:42:19.540 --> 07:42:21.540
and yet the same type thing

07:42:21.540 --> 07:42:23.540
with our kind of care and all that jazz

07:42:23.540 --> 07:42:25.540
reefling intelligent agency

07:42:25.540 --> 07:42:27.540
since you have hyper hydrolysis

07:42:27.540 --> 07:42:29.540
do you keep yourself well hydrated

07:42:29.540 --> 07:42:31.540
the way that I can tell

07:42:31.540 --> 07:42:33.540
I'm actually severely dehydrated

07:42:33.540 --> 07:42:35.540
as my hands go dry

07:42:35.540 --> 07:42:37.540
that's when I know

07:42:37.540 --> 07:42:39.540
I'm like up S Creek

07:42:39.540 --> 07:42:41.540
basically as if my hands stop

07:42:41.540 --> 07:42:43.540
my feet will never stop

07:42:43.540 --> 07:42:45.540
I have never been aware of my feet

07:42:45.540 --> 07:42:47.540
stopping sweating

07:42:47.540 --> 07:42:49.540
lucky me

07:42:49.540 --> 07:42:51.540
I was always so embarrassed

07:42:51.540 --> 07:42:53.540
and as well I don't know if you guys have school dance

07:42:53.540 --> 07:42:55.540
but I used to like

07:42:55.540 --> 07:42:57.540
rub my hands on my trousers

07:42:57.540 --> 07:42:59.540
like really quickly before I like

07:42:59.540 --> 07:43:01.540
and I'm sure I bet you my dance partner

07:43:01.540 --> 07:43:03.540
like whoever you got on the day

07:43:03.540 --> 07:43:05.540
felt like I was doing it on purpose

07:43:05.540 --> 07:43:07.540
like oh boy

07:43:07.540 --> 07:43:09.540
and it's like no I have a really bad sweat problem

07:43:09.540 --> 07:43:11.540
I don't want anyone to know about it

07:43:11.540 --> 07:43:13.540
he he

07:43:13.540 --> 07:43:15.540
she's just like me for real

07:43:15.540 --> 07:43:17.540
for real

07:43:17.540 --> 07:43:19.540
melody is dark and wholesome

07:43:19.540 --> 07:43:21.540
yet darkly lewd

07:43:21.540 --> 07:43:23.540
you're nerdy and yappy and intensively lewd

07:43:25.540 --> 07:43:27.540
through the sneak

07:43:27.540 --> 07:43:29.540
I've never been to a school dance

07:43:29.540 --> 07:43:31.540
oh I guess maybe

07:43:31.540 --> 07:43:33.540
not every country does it

07:43:33.540 --> 07:43:35.540
but we had to learn like

07:43:35.540 --> 07:43:37.540
Scottish traditional dance like the gay garden

07:43:37.540 --> 07:43:39.540
did you say the gay garden

07:43:39.540 --> 07:43:41.540
yes gay isn't happy ha ha ha we get it

07:43:41.540 --> 07:43:43.540
we're

07:43:43.540 --> 07:43:45.540
called gay garden

07:43:45.540 --> 07:43:47.540
which means happy dance

07:43:47.540 --> 07:43:49.540
never been to a school dance can't relate

07:43:51.540 --> 07:43:53.540
I have hyperdologists too

07:43:53.540 --> 07:43:55.540
so I'm constantly dehydrated

07:43:55.540 --> 07:43:57.540
suck

07:43:57.540 --> 07:43:59.540
had school dance here in New Zealand

07:43:59.540 --> 07:44:01.540
it was similar

07:44:01.540 --> 07:44:03.540
cause I hate having to wipe my hands

07:44:03.540 --> 07:44:05.540
hi

07:44:05.540 --> 07:44:07.540
hi Astrone

07:44:07.540 --> 07:44:09.540
what sort of maros would you hate to receive

07:44:09.540 --> 07:44:11.540
I don't know

07:44:19.540 --> 07:44:21.540
what would I hate to receive

07:44:21.540 --> 07:44:23.540
I don't know

07:44:25.540 --> 07:44:27.540
nothing really

07:44:27.540 --> 07:44:29.540
ha ha

07:44:29.540 --> 07:44:31.540
I don't know nothing really gets me like

07:44:31.540 --> 07:44:33.540
I can't even think of an example

07:44:33.540 --> 07:44:35.540
I don't know maybe like

07:44:35.540 --> 07:44:37.540
ask me to finish a game

07:44:37.540 --> 07:44:39.540
I didn't finish or something

07:44:39.540 --> 07:44:41.540
or be like you suck at this game

07:44:41.540 --> 07:44:43.540
oh my heart you've got me

07:44:43.540 --> 07:44:45.540
I can't believe it I can't believe I didn't finish every single game I've ever started

07:44:45.540 --> 07:44:47.540
oh you got me

07:44:47.540 --> 07:44:49.540
I don't know I can't think of an example

07:44:53.540 --> 07:44:55.540
I think the force this is

07:44:55.540 --> 07:44:57.540
dances at some point in primary middle

07:44:57.540 --> 07:44:59.540
I went to a school dance

07:44:59.540 --> 07:45:01.540
there was not a specific dance I had to learn

07:45:01.540 --> 07:45:03.540
ah

07:45:03.540 --> 07:45:05.540
never went to a dance but always to the after party

07:45:05.540 --> 07:45:07.540
ooh ballin

07:45:07.540 --> 07:45:09.540
everyone quick tried to get under her skin

07:45:09.540 --> 07:45:11.540
why would you want under my skin

07:45:15.540 --> 07:45:17.540
you'd rather be

07:45:17.540 --> 07:45:19.540
I would say in it but hold on a minute

07:45:19.540 --> 07:45:21.540
that doesn't sound right

07:45:21.540 --> 07:45:23.540
hold on a minute there

07:45:25.540 --> 07:45:27.540
you suck at Skyrim

07:45:27.540 --> 07:45:29.540
when you're gonna finish it

07:45:29.540 --> 07:45:31.540
oh you've got me

07:45:31.540 --> 07:45:33.540
tell me how bad I am at the RDA side

07:45:33.540 --> 07:45:35.540
oh

07:45:35.540 --> 07:45:37.540
you've got me I can't believe it

07:45:37.540 --> 07:45:39.540
I should probably drink my tea and then we'll jump back into Skyrim

07:45:39.540 --> 07:45:41.540
that's right the tunes are on

07:45:41.540 --> 07:45:43.540
tunes are on

07:45:43.540 --> 07:45:45.540
okay I'm hydrating

07:45:45.540 --> 07:45:47.540
I'm hydrating

07:45:53.540 --> 07:45:55.540
she doesn't even know how to chase the RDA

07:45:55.540 --> 07:45:57.540
oh you've got me I didn't know

07:45:57.540 --> 07:45:59.540
to put the grenade launcher on

07:46:01.540 --> 07:46:03.540
who would have thought a grenade launcher

07:46:07.540 --> 07:46:09.540
I can't believe it I'm being

07:46:09.540 --> 07:46:11.540
I'm being dunked on

07:46:15.540 --> 07:46:17.540
I would probably say the thing

07:46:17.540 --> 07:46:19.540
that would genuinely upset me the most

07:46:19.540 --> 07:46:21.540
is if someone sent me something nasty

07:46:21.540 --> 07:46:23.540
about the daughters

07:46:23.540 --> 07:46:25.540
and obviously if that starts to appear

07:46:25.540 --> 07:46:27.540
in the inbox I know it's

07:46:27.540 --> 07:46:29.540
not to pay heed

07:46:29.540 --> 07:46:31.540
but it's probably the worst thing I can imagine

07:46:31.540 --> 07:46:33.540
but then again I was like

07:46:33.540 --> 07:46:35.540
well you're subjecting me to that and not them

07:46:35.540 --> 07:46:37.540
so

07:46:37.540 --> 07:46:39.540
it is what it is

07:46:43.540 --> 07:46:45.540
I like how she goes idle

07:46:45.540 --> 07:46:47.540
I self defend

07:46:47.540 --> 07:46:49.540
well it's actually for hunting

07:46:49.540 --> 07:46:51.540
but

07:46:51.540 --> 07:46:53.540
I think it can be used

07:46:53.540 --> 07:46:55.540
for a distraction as well before I ink on you

07:46:55.540 --> 07:46:57.540
I just ink on you and run away

07:46:57.540 --> 07:46:59.540
like what you're gonna do about it

07:46:59.540 --> 07:47:01.540
before you can even react I'm already gone

07:47:05.540 --> 07:47:07.540
if you ever play a follow game

07:47:07.540 --> 07:47:09.540
do you go for stats or stylists

07:47:09.540 --> 07:47:11.540
oh stats

07:47:11.540 --> 07:47:13.540
I absolutely cannot

07:47:13.540 --> 07:47:15.540
for the life of me

07:47:15.540 --> 07:47:17.540
by the pope

07:47:17.540 --> 07:47:19.540
what

07:47:21.540 --> 07:47:23.540
no way miss Morgan

07:47:23.540 --> 07:47:25.540
that's hilarious

07:47:25.540 --> 07:47:27.540
that's hilarious

07:47:27.540 --> 07:47:29.540
congrats on getting back

07:47:29.540 --> 07:47:31.540
hopefully work went well

07:47:31.540 --> 07:47:33.540
and it wasn't too painful or perishing

07:47:33.540 --> 07:47:35.540
that's absolutely hilarious

07:47:35.540 --> 07:47:37.540
thank you for the tip

07:47:39.540 --> 07:47:41.540
inks on you leaves refuses to elaborate

07:47:41.540 --> 07:47:43.540
like an absolute chattel fish

07:47:43.540 --> 07:47:45.540
that's right chattel fish I'll take that title

07:47:45.540 --> 07:47:47.540
she blasted on me and ran away

07:47:47.540 --> 07:47:49.540
what if I ink faster than you

07:47:49.540 --> 07:47:51.540
one minute 56 I think

07:47:51.540 --> 07:47:53.540
beat that good luck

07:47:53.540 --> 07:47:55.540
like you can't

07:47:55.540 --> 07:47:57.540
you literally can't beat that record I'm sorry

07:48:01.540 --> 07:48:03.540
okay I finished my tea

07:48:03.540 --> 07:48:05.540
right let's see about actually getting

07:48:05.540 --> 07:48:07.540
oh wait no I was in the sky room

07:48:07.540 --> 07:48:09.540
but now I need to turn my controller on

07:48:09.540 --> 07:48:11.540
I

07:48:11.540 --> 07:48:13.540
I

07:48:13.540 --> 07:48:15.540
go to sleep

07:48:15.540 --> 07:48:17.540
I'm gonna sneeze

07:48:17.540 --> 07:48:19.540
I'm gonna sneeze

07:48:21.540 --> 07:48:23.540
okay there we go

07:48:23.540 --> 07:48:25.540
where are we heading

07:48:25.540 --> 07:48:27.540
I need to get a letter

07:48:27.540 --> 07:48:29.540
so I'm going to do some sacred things

07:48:31.540 --> 07:48:33.540
my ears oh sorry I forgot

07:48:33.540 --> 07:48:35.540
I'm a loud sneezer my apologies

07:48:35.540 --> 07:48:37.540
hopefully that wasn't too bad

07:48:37.540 --> 07:48:39.540
get some height

07:48:39.540 --> 07:48:41.540
do you like being a bicep

07:48:41.540 --> 07:48:43.540
no I want to sell

07:48:43.540 --> 07:48:45.540
what have you got for sale

07:48:45.540 --> 07:48:47.540
if I could give you a tissue

07:48:47.540 --> 07:48:49.540
oh no no I just wiped my snot on your hoodie

07:48:49.540 --> 07:48:51.540
I don't need a tissue

07:48:51.540 --> 07:48:53.540
just give me your hoodie

07:48:53.540 --> 07:48:55.540
don't be shy

07:48:55.540 --> 07:48:57.540

07:48:57.540 --> 07:48:59.540
give me your hoodie bring it over

07:48:59.540 --> 07:49:01.540
right I'm not gonna sell that

07:49:01.540 --> 07:49:03.540
that's silly

07:49:03.540 --> 07:49:05.540
alright just use my sleeve

07:49:05.540 --> 07:49:07.540
she suddenly started a mustang

07:49:11.540 --> 07:49:13.540
how did you manage to finish that early

07:49:17.540 --> 07:49:19.540
you know guys aren't the only

07:49:19.540 --> 07:49:21.540
one that

07:49:21.540 --> 07:49:23.540
might have a bit of the

07:49:23.540 --> 07:49:25.540
cream

07:49:25.540 --> 07:49:27.540
and yeah

07:49:27.540 --> 07:49:29.540
I'm a bit of a fiend

07:49:29.540 --> 07:49:31.540
for it so

07:49:31.540 --> 07:49:33.540
yep

07:49:33.540 --> 07:49:35.540
at ease

07:49:35.540 --> 07:49:37.540
at ease

07:49:37.540 --> 07:49:39.540
I can't get this quest started

07:49:39.540 --> 07:49:41.540
don't want to do that one

07:49:41.540 --> 07:49:43.540
retrieve the

07:49:43.540 --> 07:49:45.540
sure we can do that

07:49:45.540 --> 07:49:47.540
we'll go retrieve the glove whilst we get the courier

07:49:47.540 --> 07:49:49.540
to do his thing

07:49:49.540 --> 07:49:51.540
the glove the horn

07:49:51.540 --> 07:49:53.540
how much would you guys pay for that

07:49:53.540 --> 07:49:55.540
hoodie

07:49:55.540 --> 07:49:57.540
just come to the convention I'll snot on it for free

07:49:57.540 --> 07:49:59.540
just bring grass pollen

07:49:59.540 --> 07:50:01.540
or flowers

07:50:01.540 --> 07:50:03.540
in a way I'm like really allergic to that stuff

07:50:03.540 --> 07:50:05.540
can't go outside

07:50:07.540 --> 07:50:09.540
which is funny because I have

07:50:09.540 --> 07:50:11.540
a seed collection which I really enjoy

07:50:11.540 --> 07:50:13.540
but of course seeds don't have pollen

07:50:13.540 --> 07:50:15.540
issues on them although collecting them

07:50:15.540 --> 07:50:17.540
sometimes can have traces of pollen

07:50:17.540 --> 07:50:19.540
but it's not really a big deal like if you know what you're doing

07:50:21.540 --> 07:50:23.540
a snot

07:50:25.540 --> 07:50:27.540
okay okay okay our first dragon

07:50:27.540 --> 07:50:29.540
come land okay it's just a basic

07:50:29.540 --> 07:50:31.540
dragon

07:50:31.540 --> 07:50:33.540
please land

07:50:33.540 --> 07:50:35.540
please land

07:50:37.540 --> 07:50:39.540
oh

07:50:39.540 --> 07:50:41.540
of course it resisted soul trap

07:50:41.540 --> 07:50:43.540
it's a dragon

07:50:43.540 --> 07:50:45.540
I'm the freaking

07:50:45.540 --> 07:50:47.540
soul gem for the dragon I don't know where we're

07:50:47.540 --> 07:50:49.540
pretending otherwise

07:50:49.540 --> 07:50:51.540
oh

07:50:51.540 --> 07:50:53.540
hold on

07:50:53.540 --> 07:50:55.540
must have on his little there we go

07:50:55.540 --> 07:50:57.540
I had just emptied like

07:50:57.540 --> 07:50:59.540
all of my inventory only to pick all of that up again

07:51:03.540 --> 07:51:05.540
that was quite a reaction

07:51:05.540 --> 07:51:07.540
wait what did I do

07:51:07.540 --> 07:51:09.540
did I make a funny noise seed collection

07:51:09.540 --> 07:51:11.540
yeah you didn't see my stream yesterday

07:51:11.540 --> 07:51:13.540
I showed off my seed collection

07:51:13.540 --> 07:51:15.540
at like one hour in

07:51:15.540 --> 07:51:17.540
mud crab down

07:51:19.540 --> 07:51:21.540
obliterate that dragons one

07:51:21.540 --> 07:51:23.540
ankle I know I smashed it

07:51:23.540 --> 07:51:25.540
into dust and he is like okay I'm done

07:51:25.540 --> 07:51:27.540
I'm done here

07:51:29.540 --> 07:51:31.540
wow that was really easy

07:51:31.540 --> 07:51:33.540
what a bad dragon

07:51:41.540 --> 07:51:43.540
you don't have to tell me twice I'll keep cracking these

07:51:43.540 --> 07:51:45.540
jokes all day long

07:51:45.540 --> 07:51:47.540
I love hearing you narrative about your seeds

07:51:47.540 --> 07:51:49.540
I can do like an actual informal

07:51:49.540 --> 07:51:51.540
informational stream

07:51:51.540 --> 07:51:53.540
I think there's four ways of seed dispersal

07:51:53.540 --> 07:51:55.540
air

07:51:55.540 --> 07:51:57.540
hook

07:51:57.540 --> 07:51:59.540
berry

07:51:59.540 --> 07:52:01.540
is there one more

07:52:01.540 --> 07:52:03.540
is it chippers

07:52:03.540 --> 07:52:05.540
like strawberries and potato

07:52:05.540 --> 07:52:07.540
I think I need to beat the absolute

07:52:07.540 --> 07:52:09.540
yeah I need to beat

07:52:09.540 --> 07:52:11.540
everything I need to do

07:52:11.540 --> 07:52:13.540
oh

07:52:13.540 --> 07:52:15.540
one shot I love when they're one

07:52:15.540 --> 07:52:17.540
shot oh my gosh

07:52:17.540 --> 07:52:19.540
right stop

07:52:19.540 --> 07:52:21.540
yeah don't do that again

07:52:21.540 --> 07:52:23.540
do you understand me

07:52:23.540 --> 07:52:25.540
do you understand me

07:52:25.540 --> 07:52:27.540
good boy

07:52:27.540 --> 07:52:29.540
because don't do that again

07:52:31.540 --> 07:52:33.540
the fourth is cranking

07:52:33.540 --> 07:52:35.540
boom yeah yeah

07:52:35.540 --> 07:52:37.540

07:54:03.540 --> 07:54:05.540
on the outskirts

07:54:05.540 --> 07:54:07.540

07:54:17.540 --> 07:54:19.540
uh you can just go this way

07:54:19.540 --> 07:54:21.540
if you really don't want to do the fight

07:54:21.540 --> 07:54:23.540
Lydia should actually clean up

07:54:23.540 --> 07:54:25.540
any enemies

07:54:25.540 --> 07:54:27.540
oh I'm getting

07:54:27.540 --> 07:54:29.540
so many soul gems

07:54:29.540 --> 07:54:31.540
I'm gonna make so much money

07:54:31.540 --> 07:54:33.540
selling all the enchanted

07:54:33.540 --> 07:54:35.540
jewelry

07:54:35.540 --> 07:54:37.540
what's going on in here

07:54:37.540 --> 07:54:39.540
I can never remember

07:54:39.540 --> 07:54:41.540
I think there's something back there

07:54:43.540 --> 07:54:45.540
a hint

07:54:45.540 --> 07:54:47.540
oh my god I'm getting so many

07:54:47.540 --> 07:54:49.540
fricking souls

07:54:49.540 --> 07:54:51.540
might as well call this game

07:54:51.540 --> 07:54:53.540
George what's that one do

07:54:55.540 --> 07:54:57.540
what is this

07:54:57.540 --> 07:54:59.540
oh an enchantment room where are the odds

07:54:59.540 --> 07:55:01.540
literally the very thing that I'm here for

07:55:01.540 --> 07:55:03.540
well not here for

07:55:03.540 --> 07:55:05.540
cause I'm actually doing a quest

07:55:05.540 --> 07:55:07.540
alright okay sure take the dagger

07:55:09.540 --> 07:55:11.540
200 feels so good

07:55:11.540 --> 07:55:13.540
right so I can

07:55:13.540 --> 07:55:15.540
I can enchant this

07:55:15.540 --> 07:55:17.540
possibly with

07:55:17.540 --> 07:55:19.540
soul trap

07:55:19.540 --> 07:55:21.540
and then give it a

07:55:21.540 --> 07:55:23.540
greater soul gem

07:55:23.540 --> 07:55:25.540
these are all petty

07:55:25.540 --> 07:55:27.540
okay give it a greater

07:55:27.540 --> 07:55:29.540
and then the other stuff

07:55:29.540 --> 07:55:31.540
will just shove anything on it

07:55:31.540 --> 07:55:33.540
doesn't really matter

07:55:33.540 --> 07:55:35.540
as long as we just get some

07:55:35.540 --> 07:55:37.540
XP

07:55:37.540 --> 07:55:39.540
we're at 44 already

07:55:39.540 --> 07:55:41.540
fantastic

07:55:41.540 --> 07:55:43.540
just shoving

07:55:43.540 --> 07:55:45.540
anything on it

07:55:49.540 --> 07:55:51.540
and these are worth a lot so as our

07:55:51.540 --> 07:55:53.540
speech goes up we get even more money as time

07:55:53.540 --> 07:55:55.540
goes on

07:55:55.540 --> 07:55:57.540
okay

07:55:57.540 --> 07:55:59.540
no I

07:55:59.540 --> 07:56:01.540

like

08:01:43.540 --> 08:01:45.540

08:01:49.540 --> 08:01:51.540
even though I've done it a few times now

08:01:55.540 --> 08:01:57.540
good thing you don't have a mod

08:01:57.540 --> 08:01:59.540
this is why we play vanilla cause

08:01:59.540 --> 08:02:01.540

08:03:55.540 --> 08:03:57.540

for one of her classes and got an A

08:04:53.540 --> 08:04:55.540
he yanked it and then submitted it as his own

08:04:55.540 --> 08:04:57.540
that's actually really smart

08:04:57.540 --> 08:04:59.540
astrid

08:04:59.540 --> 08:05:01.540

08:05:05.540 --> 08:05:07.540
does it matter

08:05:07.540 --> 08:05:09.540
you're warm dry and still very much

08:05:09.540 --> 08:05:11.540
alive

08:05:11.540 --> 08:05:13.540
that's more than can be said for old

08:05:13.540 --> 08:05:15.540
grailard

08:05:15.540 --> 08:05:17.540
you know about that

08:05:17.540 --> 08:05:19.540
half of skyrim knows

08:05:19.540 --> 08:05:21.540
old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage

08:05:21.540 --> 08:05:23.540
things like that tend to get around

08:05:23.540 --> 08:05:25.540
oh but don't misunderstand

08:05:25.540 --> 08:05:27.540
I'm not criticizing

08:05:27.540 --> 08:05:29.540
it was a good kill

08:05:29.540 --> 08:05:31.540
old crone had it coming

08:05:31.540 --> 08:05:33.540
and you saved a group of urchins

08:05:33.540 --> 08:05:35.540
to boot

08:05:35.540 --> 08:05:37.540
but there is a slight

08:05:37.540 --> 08:05:39.540
did we make a oopsie

08:05:39.540 --> 08:05:41.540
a problem

08:05:41.540 --> 08:05:43.540
you see that little erotino boy

08:05:43.540 --> 08:05:45.540
was looking for the dark brotherhood

08:05:45.540 --> 08:05:47.540
aha

08:05:47.540 --> 08:05:49.540
and my associates

08:05:49.540 --> 08:05:51.540
grailard the kind was by all rights

08:05:51.540 --> 08:05:53.540
a dark brotherhood contract

08:05:53.540 --> 08:05:55.540
a kill

08:05:55.540 --> 08:05:57.540
that you stole

08:05:57.540 --> 08:05:59.540
it's an honest mistake

08:05:59.540 --> 08:06:01.540
you must repay

08:06:01.540 --> 08:06:03.540
you want me to murder someone else

08:06:03.540 --> 08:06:05.540
well now funny you should ask

08:06:05.540 --> 08:06:07.540
if you turn around

08:06:07.540 --> 08:06:09.540
you'll notice my guests

08:06:09.540 --> 08:06:11.540
I've collected them from

08:06:11.540 --> 08:06:13.540
well that's not really

08:06:13.540 --> 08:06:15.540
important

08:06:15.540 --> 08:06:17.540
and now that's what matters

08:06:17.540 --> 08:06:19.540
you see

08:06:19.540 --> 08:06:21.540
there's a contract out on one of them

08:06:21.540 --> 08:06:23.540
and that person can't leave

08:06:23.540 --> 08:06:25.540
this room alive

08:06:25.540 --> 08:06:27.540
but oh

08:06:27.540 --> 08:06:29.540
there's a contract

08:06:29.540 --> 08:06:31.540
see if you can figure it out

08:06:31.540 --> 08:06:33.540
hmm make your choice

08:06:33.540 --> 08:06:35.540
make your kill

08:06:35.540 --> 08:06:37.540
I just want to observe

08:06:37.540 --> 08:06:39.540
and deny it

08:06:39.540 --> 08:06:41.540

08:06:43.540 --> 08:06:45.540

08:06:45.540 --> 08:06:47.540
I knew we could resolve this civilly

08:06:47.540 --> 08:06:49.540
a debt owed must be repaid

08:06:49.540 --> 08:06:51.540
you understand

08:06:51.540 --> 08:06:53.540
oh we want to kill the spree now

08:06:53.540 --> 08:06:55.540

08:06:55.540 --> 08:06:57.540
pick your guest

08:06:57.540 --> 08:06:59.540
and send the poor fool to the void

08:06:59.540 --> 08:07:01.540

08:20:43.540 --> 08:20:45.540
note she definitely is

08:20:45.540 --> 08:20:47.540
shaking

08:20:47.540 --> 08:20:49.540
care of

08:20:49.540 --> 08:20:51.540
those children a bit more

08:20:53.540 --> 08:20:55.540
yes we are just going for a cheeky stab

08:20:55.540 --> 08:20:57.540
yeah there should be someone

08:20:57.540 --> 08:20:59.540
in a tent over here um

08:21:01.540 --> 08:21:03.540
I don't know if we could

08:21:05.540 --> 08:21:07.540
I could have sworn you can speak to this

08:21:07.540 --> 08:21:09.540
person and they recognize you as

08:21:09.540 --> 08:21:11.540
someone from the dark brotherhood but

08:21:11.540 --> 08:21:13.540
they don't do anything about it I'm like

08:21:13.540 --> 08:21:15.540
99% sure

08:21:15.540 --> 08:21:17.540
why are you here get away from me

08:21:17.540 --> 08:21:19.540
uh

08:21:19.540 --> 08:21:21.540
you are right to be paranoid

08:21:21.540 --> 08:21:23.540
what what do you mean

08:21:23.540 --> 08:21:25.540
oh oh oh no

08:21:25.540 --> 08:21:27.540
no

08:21:27.540 --> 08:21:29.540
please don't kill me

08:21:29.540 --> 08:21:31.540
oh shit I missed wait

08:21:31.540 --> 08:21:33.540
hold on

08:21:33.540 --> 08:21:35.540
no

08:21:35.540 --> 08:21:37.540
okay maybe I thought

08:21:37.540 --> 08:21:39.540
he didn't run away

08:21:39.540 --> 08:21:41.540
uh but I guess he did

08:21:41.540 --> 08:21:43.540
uh right had I get to I'll just take

08:21:43.540 --> 08:21:45.540
I'll just go westward from here

08:21:47.540 --> 08:21:49.540
time to adopt six children for gen 2

08:21:49.540 --> 08:21:51.540
oops let's not talk about gen 2

08:21:55.540 --> 08:21:57.540
oh no

08:21:57.540 --> 08:21:59.540
I love

08:21:59.540 --> 08:22:01.540
that actively

08:22:01.540 --> 08:22:03.540
wait you can't go that way

08:22:03.540 --> 08:22:05.540
I love that actively when you talk

08:22:05.540 --> 08:22:07.540
like when you do stuff in Skyrim

08:22:07.540 --> 08:22:09.540
like the NPCs kind of discuss it

08:22:09.540 --> 08:22:11.540
I think that's such a cool little

08:22:11.540 --> 08:22:13.540
detail I have to admit for a game

08:22:13.540 --> 08:22:15.540
for a game that came out in

08:22:15.540 --> 08:22:17.540
2011 and was produced

08:22:17.540 --> 08:22:19.540
like before that that was pretty

08:22:19.540 --> 08:22:21.540
I don't give a that's pretty decent you know

08:22:21.540 --> 08:22:23.540
like you're

08:22:23.540 --> 08:22:25.540
gonna give it to them sometimes can't

08:22:25.540 --> 08:22:27.540
can't give them all the credit but you gotta give it to them

08:22:27.540 --> 08:22:29.540
sometimes uh unfortunately I believe

08:22:29.540 --> 08:22:31.540
we do we have to go south

08:22:31.540 --> 08:22:33.540
no we don't

08:22:33.540 --> 08:22:35.540
I'm just taking super

08:22:35.540 --> 08:22:37.540
long obnoxious way so I'm

08:22:37.540 --> 08:22:39.540
going to teleport back and then I'm basically

08:22:39.540 --> 08:22:41.540
just gonna go along the water's edge

08:22:41.540 --> 08:22:43.540
to get to the stone store

08:22:43.540 --> 08:22:45.540
death is highly overrated

08:22:47.540 --> 08:22:49.540
infamous last words

08:22:49.540 --> 08:22:51.540
IS the elusive warhammer

08:22:51.540 --> 08:22:53.540
staff literally oh you didn't see it coming

08:22:55.540 --> 08:22:57.540
just imagine how cool

08:22:57.540 --> 08:22:59.540
Skyrim 2 will be

08:23:01.540 --> 08:23:03.540
did they even announce it yet

08:23:03.540 --> 08:23:05.540
or am I going crazy and they have

08:23:05.540 --> 08:23:07.540
jeez how do I get down

08:23:07.540 --> 08:23:09.540
I've not just done that have I

08:23:09.540 --> 08:23:11.540
that'll be fine

08:23:11.540 --> 08:23:13.540
that'll be fine on the old ankles

08:23:13.540 --> 08:23:15.540
right maybe this will do

08:23:15.540 --> 08:23:17.540
easy easy just

08:23:17.540 --> 08:23:19.540
edge it a little bit

08:23:19.540 --> 08:23:21.540
nice and slow slowly

08:23:21.540 --> 08:23:23.540
slower

08:23:25.540 --> 08:23:27.540
good boy

08:23:27.540 --> 08:23:29.540
that's terrible

08:23:29.540 --> 08:23:31.540
I shouldn't do that that's no need

08:23:31.540 --> 08:23:33.540
you shouldn't egg me on either

08:23:33.540 --> 08:23:35.540
Elder Scroll 6

08:23:35.540 --> 08:23:37.540
is in development

08:23:37.540 --> 08:23:39.540
okay okay

08:23:39.540 --> 08:23:41.540
I could have sworn

08:23:41.540 --> 08:23:43.540
they hardly freaking

08:23:43.540 --> 08:23:45.540
talk about the damn thing

08:23:45.540 --> 08:23:47.540
I can't with you oh my god

08:23:47.540 --> 08:23:49.540
literally it's too easy

08:23:49.540 --> 08:23:51.540
the problem is you give me too much power

08:23:51.540 --> 08:23:53.540
and then I get high on it and I just

08:23:53.540 --> 08:23:55.540
do it all the time

08:23:55.540 --> 08:23:57.540
I'm not being funny that girl gave me far too

08:23:57.540 --> 08:23:59.540
much power with me seeing them freezes

08:23:59.540 --> 08:24:01.540
excuse you

08:24:01.540 --> 08:24:03.540
excuse you

08:24:03.540 --> 08:24:05.540
give me your soul

08:24:05.540 --> 08:24:07.540
no

08:24:07.540 --> 08:24:09.540
oh I'm out of soul gems

08:24:09.540 --> 08:24:11.540
where the heck am I going

08:24:11.540 --> 08:24:13.540
where the heck am I supposed to

08:24:13.540 --> 08:24:15.540
go straight ahead

08:24:15.540 --> 08:24:17.540
into the water

08:24:19.540 --> 08:24:21.540
why not get a horse it takes too

08:24:21.540 --> 08:24:23.540
long doesn't it I thought it tastes like

08:24:23.540 --> 08:24:25.540
fruit and the horse aren't even that fast

08:24:25.540 --> 08:24:27.540
don't you beat me up

08:24:27.540 --> 08:24:29.540
I'll beat you

08:24:29.540 --> 08:24:31.540
I'll smack you on your forehead it is

08:24:31.540 --> 08:24:33.540
um

08:24:33.540 --> 08:24:35.540
I don't mind giving you the power

08:24:35.540 --> 08:24:37.540
you're still going strong

08:24:37.540 --> 08:24:39.540
yeah sorry

08:24:39.540 --> 08:24:41.540
I am

08:24:41.540 --> 08:24:43.540
I am going to redirect into mercy

08:24:43.540 --> 08:24:45.540
because unfortunately my achievements bugged out

08:24:45.540 --> 08:24:47.540
so it kind of

08:24:47.540 --> 08:24:49.540
may or may not have defeated

08:24:49.540 --> 08:24:51.540
the whole purpose of this achievement

08:24:51.540 --> 08:24:53.540
run

08:24:53.540 --> 08:24:55.540
man we keep running into Talos

08:24:55.540 --> 08:24:57.540
literally he was like that snake

08:24:57.540 --> 08:24:59.540
and then he was like yeah I don't care

08:24:59.540 --> 08:25:01.540
I can't I'm boss

08:25:01.540 --> 08:25:03.540
I'm bossing on me

08:25:03.540 --> 08:25:05.540
what if we

08:25:05.540 --> 08:25:07.540
weflings get the power

08:25:07.540 --> 08:25:09.540
anarchy

08:25:09.540 --> 08:25:11.540
very classic if you power over me

08:25:11.540 --> 08:25:13.540
bro if you're actually making me blush

08:25:13.540 --> 08:25:15.540
you need to stop

08:25:15.540 --> 08:25:17.540
I'm like oh my god a girl

08:25:17.540 --> 08:25:19.540
me you like me

08:25:19.540 --> 08:25:21.540
can't comprehend it

08:25:21.540 --> 08:25:23.540
can't comprehend it doesn't make sense

08:25:23.540 --> 08:25:25.540
what do you mean the Scottish accent

08:25:25.540 --> 08:25:27.540
can you cringe out your boots

08:25:27.540 --> 08:25:29.540
what do you mean

08:25:29.540 --> 08:25:31.540
surely too much power

08:25:31.540 --> 08:25:33.540
Talos knows

08:25:33.540 --> 08:25:35.540
see I'm a little I'm walking in a Talos

08:25:35.540 --> 08:25:37.540
north west

08:25:37.540 --> 08:25:39.540
so I can't even talk

08:25:39.540 --> 08:25:41.540
I'm getting flustered

08:25:41.540 --> 08:25:43.540
thinking there's a girl watching me what the fuck

08:25:43.540 --> 08:25:45.540
okay right I'm just

08:25:45.540 --> 08:25:47.540
going to confess this straight off the bat

08:25:47.540 --> 08:25:49.540
so I used to play Call of Duty

08:25:49.540 --> 08:25:51.540
and whenever there was like a girl on my team

08:25:51.540 --> 08:25:53.540
I used to get really flustered and I couldn't even talk properly

08:25:53.540 --> 08:25:55.540
I just like completely clam up

08:25:55.540 --> 08:25:57.540
and I'm just like uh uh uh

08:25:57.540 --> 08:25:59.540
and I just get really like freaking terrible about it

08:25:59.540 --> 08:26:01.540
so it's really I don't know why

08:26:01.540 --> 08:26:03.540
I still haven't come over yet

08:26:03.540 --> 08:26:05.540
because I played a few rounds of valorant and it happened

08:26:05.540 --> 08:26:07.540
there was a girl on my team and I couldn't speak

08:26:07.540 --> 08:26:09.540
at all in voice chat and I don't know what it is

08:26:09.540 --> 08:26:11.540
and it's not even like

08:26:11.540 --> 08:26:13.540
I'm trying to like impress her or anything

08:26:13.540 --> 08:26:15.540
I just like get all weird and like

08:26:15.540 --> 08:26:17.540
I don't want to bother her you know I'm being weird

08:26:17.540 --> 08:26:19.540
oh

08:26:19.540 --> 08:26:21.540
I'm like

08:26:21.540 --> 08:26:23.540
it's not like I'm trying to like pick someone up

08:26:23.540 --> 08:26:25.540
or anything and I'm like freaking Call of Duty

08:26:25.540 --> 08:26:27.540
I don't know why I get all clammed up and it's happening

08:26:27.540 --> 08:26:29.540
it's literally happening right now in live stream

08:26:29.540 --> 08:26:31.540
and I'm like oh my god now everyone knows I'm a weirdo

08:26:31.540 --> 08:26:33.540
and I'm like uh

08:26:33.540 --> 08:26:35.540
talking to Wham is hard

08:26:35.540 --> 08:26:37.540
okay

08:26:37.540 --> 08:26:39.540
better not speaking and starting

08:26:39.540 --> 08:26:41.540
to say bad jokes

08:26:41.540 --> 08:26:43.540
she's just like the majority of guys

08:26:45.540 --> 08:26:47.540
climbing up like basically every other

08:26:47.540 --> 08:26:49.540
player of honestly

08:26:51.540 --> 08:26:53.540
girls are still here

08:26:55.540 --> 08:26:57.540
wait until she really is

08:26:57.540 --> 08:26:59.540
so the reason

08:26:59.540 --> 08:27:01.540
why it feels like it's different

08:27:01.540 --> 08:27:03.540
for valorant girls is because

08:27:03.540 --> 08:27:05.540
like I'm not trying to

08:27:05.540 --> 08:27:07.540
I don't know

08:27:09.540 --> 08:27:11.540
I'm not like trying to

08:27:11.540 --> 08:27:13.540
you know get anything out of them

08:27:13.540 --> 08:27:15.540
no that sounds really odd that makes it sound like I'm

08:27:15.540 --> 08:27:17.540
freaking honing in that sounds really odd

08:27:17.540 --> 08:27:19.540
hold on

08:27:19.540 --> 08:27:21.540
let me think anything

08:27:29.540 --> 08:27:31.540
thank you for the dono iron reaper again

either you're giving me the tip or the D

08:27:37.540 --> 08:27:39.540

08:27:41.540 --> 08:27:43.540
call that a clam gem

08:27:43.540 --> 08:27:45.540
shawney climbing up

08:27:47.540 --> 08:27:49.540
if speaking to women is hard

08:27:49.540 --> 08:27:51.540
then you sure are very talented at it

08:27:51.540 --> 08:27:53.540
well I'm like freaking my hands are sweating

08:27:53.540 --> 08:27:55.540
now and I'm getting my faces

08:27:55.540 --> 08:27:57.540
already it's burning up I can feel it

08:27:57.540 --> 08:27:59.540
and I'm like oh my god I need to like

08:27:59.540 --> 08:28:01.540

can I hurt you on your own balcony

08:28:05.540 --> 08:28:07.540
no

08:28:07.540 --> 08:28:09.540
question mark

08:28:11.540 --> 08:28:13.540

08:28:29.540 --> 08:28:31.540
for the don star

08:28:31.540 --> 08:28:33.540
based off of yesterday's stream

08:28:33.540 --> 08:28:35.540
most of us can probably give you

08:28:35.540 --> 08:28:37.540
the tip

08:28:37.540 --> 08:28:39.540
honestly

08:28:39.540 --> 08:28:41.540
didn't you say that your hands are always sweating

08:28:41.540 --> 08:28:43.540
yes but I am

08:28:43.540 --> 08:28:45.540
I do have physical reactions

08:28:45.540 --> 08:28:47.540
to like stressors and it can make them sweat

08:28:47.540 --> 08:28:49.540
even more my left hand is currently soaked

08:28:49.540 --> 08:28:51.540
and my right hand

08:28:51.540 --> 08:28:53.540

08:29:31.540 --> 08:29:33.540

08:29:37.540 --> 08:29:39.540
cool little tidbit

08:29:39.540 --> 08:29:41.540
if you didn't know

08:29:41.540 --> 08:29:43.540

08:29:47.540 --> 08:29:49.540
anyway hi

08:29:49.540 --> 08:29:51.540

08:29:51.540 --> 08:29:53.540
anything

08:29:57.540 --> 08:29:59.540
wait oh I got bounty

08:29:59.540 --> 08:30:01.540
added to me that's not good that means the guards

08:30:01.540 --> 08:30:03.540
are always going to come up to me unless I clear the bounty

08:30:05.540 --> 08:30:07.540
could you imagine

08:30:07.540 --> 08:30:09.540
you could start short circuiting

08:30:09.540 --> 08:30:11.540
well that's why the plastic on like the controller

08:30:11.540 --> 08:30:13.540
and that is really good for that

08:30:13.540 --> 08:30:15.540
that issue

08:30:15.540 --> 08:30:17.540
I got steam

08:30:17.540 --> 08:30:19.540
I fear for the girl

08:30:21.540 --> 08:30:23.540
I say

08:30:23.540 --> 08:30:25.540
I didn't know you were there

08:30:25.540 --> 08:30:27.540
oh my gosh

08:30:27.540 --> 08:30:29.540
I say that was terrifying

08:30:31.540 --> 08:30:33.540
this is the riskiest

08:30:33.540 --> 08:30:35.540
thing I've ever done

08:30:35.540 --> 08:30:37.540
do not go down a waterfall whatever you do

08:30:37.540 --> 08:30:39.540
by the way that's a terrible choice

08:30:39.540 --> 08:30:41.540
can I teleport back to

08:30:43.540 --> 08:30:45.540
I can't no I can't

08:30:45.540 --> 08:30:47.540
are you still playing on

08:30:47.540 --> 08:30:49.540
legendary yes I am

08:30:49.540 --> 08:30:51.540
I never was

08:30:51.540 --> 08:30:53.540
not playing legendary at any point

08:30:53.540 --> 08:30:55.540
I can show you again if you want

08:30:55.540 --> 08:30:57.540
look a little to the left

08:30:57.540 --> 08:30:59.540
okay look a little to the left

08:30:59.540 --> 08:31:01.540
it's really cute that you're getting flustered over this

08:31:01.540 --> 08:31:03.540
when every time you speak makes me flustered

08:31:05.540 --> 08:31:07.540
what was I saying

08:31:07.540 --> 08:31:09.540
thank you for the tip

08:31:09.540 --> 08:31:11.540
Miss Morgan I appreciate it

08:31:11.540 --> 08:31:13.540
what was I

08:31:13.540 --> 08:31:15.540
showing

08:31:15.540 --> 08:31:17.540
oh yeah I'm on legendary

08:31:17.540 --> 08:31:19.540
look a little to the left see look see

08:31:19.540 --> 08:31:21.540
legendary

08:31:21.540 --> 08:31:23.540
I've been on it the entire time

08:31:23.540 --> 08:31:25.540
I don't know why anyone thinks

08:31:25.540 --> 08:31:27.540
I'm not on legendary for some reason

08:31:27.540 --> 08:31:29.540
the proof is right on screen right now

08:31:29.540 --> 08:31:31.540
so it's rather odd

08:31:31.540 --> 08:31:33.540
rather

08:31:33.540 --> 08:31:35.540
yeah see fair enough yeah

08:31:35.540 --> 08:31:37.540
just the

08:31:37.540 --> 08:31:39.540
oh wait hold on

08:31:39.540 --> 08:31:41.540
look a little to the right again okay there you go boom

08:31:41.540 --> 08:31:43.540
what do you mean see

08:31:43.540 --> 08:31:45.540
where am I

08:31:45.540 --> 08:31:47.540
oh I'm still running away from the guards

08:31:47.540 --> 08:31:49.540
the guards aren't chasing me

08:31:49.540 --> 08:31:51.540
they can be

08:31:51.540 --> 08:31:53.540
I'm in the middle of a waterfall

08:31:53.540 --> 08:31:55.540
the guards are chasing me

08:31:55.540 --> 08:31:57.540
oh there's an in route

08:31:57.540 --> 08:31:59.540
let's go get an in route

08:31:59.540 --> 08:32:01.540
thank you for the tip again Miss

08:32:01.540 --> 08:32:03.540
Morgan

08:32:03.540 --> 08:32:05.540
I never doubt

08:32:05.540 --> 08:32:07.540
what you mean me

08:32:07.540 --> 08:32:09.540
in fact they have made

08:32:09.540 --> 08:32:11.540
legendary for strong specifically because

08:32:11.540 --> 08:32:13.540
the game was too easy

08:32:13.540 --> 08:32:15.540
true Andrew

08:32:15.540 --> 08:32:17.540
am I being

08:32:17.540 --> 08:32:19.540
can I just

08:32:19.540 --> 08:32:21.540
teleport to my location so I can

08:32:21.540 --> 08:32:23.540
progress with my campaign

08:32:23.540 --> 08:32:25.540
what is shooting bow and arrows at me

08:32:25.540 --> 08:32:27.540
is that Lydia

08:32:27.540 --> 08:32:29.540
is Lydia turned against me too

08:32:29.540 --> 08:32:31.540
get me down the stream I'm a fish

08:32:31.540 --> 08:32:33.540
I'm actually a fish get me

08:32:33.540 --> 08:32:35.540
this is literally what it looks like from

08:32:35.540 --> 08:32:37.540
the outside POV

08:32:37.540 --> 08:32:39.540
you're just zooming down the rocks

08:32:39.540 --> 08:32:41.540
okay can we

08:32:41.540 --> 08:32:43.540
teleport now

08:32:45.540 --> 08:32:47.540
yes we can

08:32:47.540 --> 08:32:49.540
she's just so good guys honestly

08:32:49.540 --> 08:32:51.540
I get so much

08:32:51.540 --> 08:32:53.540
she might have changed or something

08:32:53.540 --> 08:32:55.540
well I was going nope not at all

08:32:55.540 --> 08:32:57.540
absolutely not definitely a

08:32:57.540 --> 08:32:59.540
MLG gamer

08:32:59.540 --> 08:33:01.540
and she tells you a problem

08:33:01.540 --> 08:33:03.540
because I'm so good literally I don't know

08:33:03.540 --> 08:33:05.540
why people seem to struggle not playing on legendary

08:33:05.540 --> 08:33:07.540
oh Cicero

08:33:11.540 --> 08:33:13.540
you dare risk disobedience

08:33:13.540 --> 08:33:15.540
and surely

08:33:15.540 --> 08:33:17.540
punishment

08:33:35.540 --> 08:33:37.540
are you squiddin me right now

08:33:37.540 --> 08:33:39.540
by the Pope

08:33:41.540 --> 08:33:43.540
the benefits of being Scottish so use it

08:33:43.540 --> 08:33:45.540
to your advantage as much as you can

08:33:45.540 --> 08:33:47.540
okay

08:33:47.540 --> 08:33:49.540
thank you for the tip Kitsune

08:33:49.540 --> 08:33:51.540
use my Scottish accent

08:33:51.540 --> 08:33:53.540
to my advantage

08:34:05.540 --> 08:34:07.540
I think I might

08:34:07.540 --> 08:34:09.540
or may not be

08:34:09.540 --> 08:34:11.540
mildly

08:34:11.540 --> 08:34:13.540
rather submissive at the moment

08:34:13.540 --> 08:34:15.540
so I can't think of much to say

08:34:17.540 --> 08:34:19.540
oh pardon me

08:34:19.540 --> 08:34:21.540
putting out my weapon in the middle of a cutscene

08:34:21.540 --> 08:34:23.540
Cicero

08:34:37.540 --> 08:34:39.540
we've got business to discuss

08:34:39.540 --> 08:34:41.540
do you have a contract for me

08:34:43.540 --> 08:34:45.540
is this over for Marsh

08:34:51.540 --> 08:34:53.540
feeling submissive feels like a huge hammer

08:34:53.540 --> 08:34:55.540
honestly

08:34:55.540 --> 08:34:57.540
why does Cicero sound like junk

08:34:57.540 --> 08:34:59.540
oh why would you say something like that

08:35:13.540 --> 08:35:15.540
I've already done that

08:35:21.540 --> 08:35:23.540
nice Cicero

08:35:25.540 --> 08:35:27.540
it's good to meet you too Cicero

08:35:27.540 --> 08:35:29.540
just keep your distance Jester and we'll get along just fine

08:35:29.540 --> 08:35:31.540
it's good to meet you

08:35:37.540 --> 08:35:39.540
aww

08:35:41.540 --> 08:35:43.540
I would like to keep him alive this time

08:35:45.540 --> 08:35:47.540
why did you come to the sanctuary Cicero

08:35:51.540 --> 08:35:53.540
come to Bravil

08:36:01.540 --> 08:36:03.540
aggressive sub

08:36:13.540 --> 08:36:15.540
how much did they spend on this

08:36:15.540 --> 08:36:17.540
freaking voice actor Hughes

08:36:17.540 --> 08:36:19.540
he nailed it

08:36:19.540 --> 08:36:21.540
what are your duties of a keeper

08:36:21.540 --> 08:36:23.540
tell me about yourself Cicero

08:36:23.540 --> 08:36:25.540
not about the night mother

08:36:25.540 --> 08:36:27.540
by the pope who goes there

08:36:35.540 --> 08:36:37.540
thank you

08:36:45.540 --> 08:36:47.540
nice Brian

08:36:47.540 --> 08:36:49.540
for delivering that

08:36:57.540 --> 08:36:59.540
have you got a pole

08:36:59.540 --> 08:37:01.540
I want the pole if you've got a hole I want the hole

08:37:01.540 --> 08:37:03.540
don't swap

08:37:05.540 --> 08:37:07.540
you don't need a swap

08:37:17.540 --> 08:37:19.540
the listener

08:37:19.540 --> 08:37:21.540
what's a listener Cicero

08:37:25.540 --> 08:37:27.540
Stroney's an equal opportunist

08:37:27.540 --> 08:37:29.540
are you scooting me right now

08:37:31.540 --> 08:37:33.540
you dislike Cicero

08:37:33.540 --> 08:37:35.540
oh you don't like his character

08:37:47.540 --> 08:37:49.540
our lady has not chosen

08:37:49.540 --> 08:37:51.540
I mean like Cicero

08:37:51.540 --> 08:37:53.540
I like to dislike Cicero

08:37:53.540 --> 08:37:55.540
but Cicero is like trying to

08:37:57.540 --> 08:37:59.540
a little rush

08:37:59.540 --> 08:38:01.540
Stroney's such a good

08:38:01.540 --> 08:38:03.540
right you're done

08:38:03.540 --> 08:38:05.540
collectively you're done

08:38:05.540 --> 08:38:07.540
oh wait I was supposed to hand in the contract

08:38:07.540 --> 08:38:09.540
so we didn't pay attention

08:38:09.540 --> 08:38:11.540
thank you for the tip anonymous

08:38:11.540 --> 08:38:13.540
but no you got a pole keep the pole

08:38:13.540 --> 08:38:15.540
you got a hole keep the hole

08:38:15.540 --> 08:38:17.540
don't be swapping stuff around

08:38:19.540 --> 08:38:21.540
there's a whole other conversation that can come out of that

08:38:21.540 --> 08:38:23.540
but we can't even get into that

08:38:29.540 --> 08:38:31.540
we're going to very slowly hand over

08:38:31.540 --> 08:38:33.540
all the freaking things

08:38:39.540 --> 08:38:41.540
that was lovely to be backdrop

08:38:41.540 --> 08:38:43.540
thank you for the tip I appreciate that

08:38:43.540 --> 08:38:45.540
I'm glad

08:38:45.540 --> 08:38:47.540
I was worthy

08:38:47.540 --> 08:38:49.540
to wait for

08:38:49.540 --> 08:38:51.540
after all this time

08:38:51.540 --> 08:38:53.540
it had been a while

08:38:53.540 --> 08:38:55.540
I have to

08:38:55.540 --> 08:38:57.540
make up for lost time

08:39:03.540 --> 08:39:05.540
why you want to eat me

08:39:05.540 --> 08:39:07.540
I don't even thought about that

08:39:07.540 --> 08:39:09.540
oh yeah I want to eat calamarian stuff

08:39:09.540 --> 08:39:11.540
no you're not supposed to want to eat it

08:39:13.540 --> 08:39:15.540
thank you

08:39:15.540 --> 08:39:17.540
but the

08:39:17.540 --> 08:39:19.540
pick one

08:39:19.540 --> 08:39:21.540
I like how Lydia just respectfully

08:39:21.540 --> 08:39:23.540
like hangs outside she's like yeah I'm not going to come in

08:39:23.540 --> 08:39:25.540
it's not my problem

08:39:25.540 --> 08:39:27.540
you are more than worth it thank you

08:39:27.540 --> 08:39:29.540
I appreciate it

08:39:29.540 --> 08:39:31.540
there was a lot of

08:39:31.540 --> 08:39:33.540
I don't know what the word is

08:39:35.540 --> 08:39:37.540
I suppose emotional turmoil

08:39:37.540 --> 08:39:39.540
is a bit of a dramatic

08:39:39.540 --> 08:39:41.540
oh

08:39:41.540 --> 08:39:43.540
lower

08:39:43.540 --> 08:39:45.540
yeah I'm fine

08:39:47.540 --> 08:39:49.540
he was shouting about the foreign swore

08:39:49.540 --> 08:39:51.540
that was it

08:39:51.540 --> 08:39:53.540
swore swore

08:39:53.540 --> 08:39:55.540
number 65 years in the past

08:39:59.540 --> 08:40:01.540
do you know anything

08:40:01.540 --> 08:40:03.540
okay thanks for the note mate

08:40:03.540 --> 08:40:05.540
I'm not doing that questline yet hello

08:40:05.540 --> 08:40:07.540
hello

08:40:07.540 --> 08:40:09.540
the dark brother has come

08:40:11.540 --> 08:40:13.540
we're here

08:40:13.540 --> 08:40:15.540
I'd prefer it raw like sushi

08:40:17.540 --> 08:40:19.540
we're not supposed to want to eat it

08:40:19.540 --> 08:40:21.540
no

08:40:21.540 --> 08:40:23.540
one year for this totally worth it

08:40:23.540 --> 08:40:25.540
I'm freaking glad because

08:40:25.540 --> 08:40:27.540
there was like yeah the emotional turmoil

08:40:27.540 --> 08:40:29.540
like a lot of like

08:40:29.540 --> 08:40:31.540
bad memories came back to the surface

08:40:31.540 --> 08:40:33.540
but they got completely

08:40:33.540 --> 08:40:35.540
manually overrated

08:40:35.540 --> 08:40:37.540
just because of like

08:40:37.540 --> 08:40:39.540
the love and like

08:40:39.540 --> 08:40:41.540
everything that we didn't

08:40:41.540 --> 08:40:43.540
like the girls

08:40:43.540 --> 08:40:45.540
and I couldn't have predicted anything

08:40:45.540 --> 08:40:47.540
at all

08:40:47.540 --> 08:40:49.540
it was impossible to predict

08:40:49.540 --> 08:40:51.540
and we were dealing with a major

08:40:51.540 --> 08:40:53.540
calling at the time

08:40:53.540 --> 08:40:55.540
which was really messing with

08:40:55.540 --> 08:40:57.540
how to predict anything at all

08:40:57.540 --> 08:40:59.540
okay but what were we supposed to do

08:40:59.540 --> 08:41:01.540
with the fish

08:41:01.540 --> 08:41:03.540
I can give it

08:41:03.540 --> 08:41:05.540
explicit detail

08:41:05.540 --> 08:41:07.540
would you like explicit detail

08:41:09.540 --> 08:41:11.540
we love you love you little replay

08:41:15.540 --> 08:41:17.540
please do someone says lick it

08:41:21.540 --> 08:41:23.540
take the dirt

08:41:23.540 --> 08:41:25.540
right home that's all you have to do

08:41:27.540 --> 08:41:29.540
nice and easy

08:41:29.540 --> 08:41:31.540
wait is there someone here I need to perish

08:41:31.540 --> 08:41:33.540
was that not just told to come in here

08:41:35.540 --> 08:41:37.540
wait did I read the map wrong

08:41:37.540 --> 08:41:39.540
I think I might read the map

08:41:39.540 --> 08:41:41.540
map wrong

08:41:43.540 --> 08:41:45.540
you hear about the story of a dude

08:41:45.540 --> 08:41:47.540
who put a fish in his pants

08:41:47.540 --> 08:41:49.540
no I did not is this bad

08:41:53.540 --> 08:41:55.540
am I supposed to perish her

08:42:03.540 --> 08:42:05.540
she's so messed up are you okay

08:42:07.540 --> 08:42:09.540
her mother should have to bury her daughter

08:42:09.540 --> 08:42:11.540
wait so why does

08:42:11.540 --> 08:42:13.540
why does she have to be

08:42:13.540 --> 08:42:15.540
perished

08:42:15.540 --> 08:42:17.540
if it's optional I'm not actually gonna do it

08:42:17.540 --> 08:42:19.540
cause that's really mean

08:42:23.540 --> 08:42:25.540
I have a perfect mean for the situation

08:42:25.540 --> 08:42:27.540
cherish the fish worship the fish

08:42:27.540 --> 08:42:29.540
pour for all mortal possessions but no

08:42:29.540 --> 08:42:31.540
no that is nothing

08:42:33.540 --> 08:42:35.540
why are you shouldn't

08:42:35.540 --> 08:42:37.540
oh you've just

08:42:37.540 --> 08:42:39.540
attacked those bandits no wonder they're shouldn't

08:42:39.540 --> 08:42:41.540
we need to go a little to the right

08:42:45.540 --> 08:42:47.540
but I can forfeit the fish

08:42:47.540 --> 08:42:49.540
best I can forfeit to fish is to

08:42:49.540 --> 08:42:51.540
no keep it

08:42:51.540 --> 08:42:53.540
no give money to fish

08:42:53.540 --> 08:42:55.540
unless

08:42:55.540 --> 08:42:57.540
is there even an unless

08:42:59.540 --> 08:43:01.540
I don't even think there's really an unless

08:43:01.540 --> 08:43:03.540
in that scenario

08:43:03.540 --> 08:43:05.540
okay is it it's not that one

08:43:05.540 --> 08:43:07.540
no it's up here

08:43:09.540 --> 08:43:11.540
I'm not really sure

08:43:11.540 --> 08:43:13.540
if I'm gonna be able to make it to this checkpoint

08:43:13.540 --> 08:43:15.540
cause definitely not

08:43:15.540 --> 08:43:17.540
supposed to be coming up the sheer cliff face of a mountain

08:43:17.540 --> 08:43:19.540
only give money if you can afford it

08:43:19.540 --> 08:43:21.540
yeah but even then

08:43:21.540 --> 08:43:23.540
like there I feel like there's so many

08:43:23.540 --> 08:43:25.540
attachments to it and it's like

08:43:25.540 --> 08:43:27.540
only give it if you're financially stable

08:43:27.540 --> 08:43:29.540
only give it if you

08:43:29.540 --> 08:43:31.540
are like genuinely enjoying the content

08:43:31.540 --> 08:43:33.540
only give it if

08:43:33.540 --> 08:43:35.540
like you know you've treated

08:43:35.540 --> 08:43:37.540
yourself and you know you've got

08:43:37.540 --> 08:43:39.540
savings and all that and you're looking after

08:43:39.540 --> 08:43:41.540
yourself like if you're in debt

08:43:41.540 --> 08:43:43.540
or anything like that no

08:43:43.540 --> 08:43:45.540
it's a big no no

08:43:45.540 --> 08:43:47.540
like you don't need to be donating

08:43:47.540 --> 08:43:49.540
to myself and I'm sure the via lure girls

08:43:49.540 --> 08:43:51.540
all agree with me

08:43:51.540 --> 08:43:53.540
like make sure you're sorted

08:43:53.540 --> 08:43:55.540
out first make sure you're

08:43:55.540 --> 08:43:57.540
secure first like having a good time

08:43:57.540 --> 08:43:59.540

08:44:41.540 --> 08:44:43.540
I don't I think I can just skip them

08:44:43.540 --> 08:44:45.540
to be honest I'm gonna just skip them

08:44:45.540 --> 08:44:47.540

oh sorry

08:44:57.540 --> 08:44:59.540

08:44:59.540 --> 08:45:01.540

08:45:17.540 --> 08:45:19.540

but thank you very much for the

08:45:25.540 --> 08:45:27.540
quick tip I pursued

08:45:27.540 --> 08:45:29.540
way fish give

08:45:29.540 --> 08:45:31.540
life lessons

08:45:31.540 --> 08:45:33.540
I will always give life lessons

08:45:33.540 --> 08:45:35.540
I think it's very important to consider

08:45:35.540 --> 08:45:37.540
life experiences

08:45:37.540 --> 08:45:39.540
an XP bar

08:45:39.540 --> 08:45:41.540
and when you talk to people

08:45:41.540 --> 08:45:43.540
and when you get to hear other perspectives

08:45:43.540 --> 08:45:45.540
you are very slowly filling up that bar

08:45:45.540 --> 08:45:47.540
and a very big

08:45:47.540 --> 08:45:49.540
life lesson

08:45:49.540 --> 08:45:51.540
can be

08:45:51.540 --> 08:45:53.540
hold on hold on

08:45:53.540 --> 08:45:55.540
I'm wrecking and decking right now

08:45:55.540 --> 08:45:57.540
hey

08:46:03.540 --> 08:46:05.540
oh right okay well

08:46:05.540 --> 08:46:07.540
you weren't really I thought

08:46:07.540 --> 08:46:09.540
okay that was really bizarre

08:46:09.540 --> 08:46:11.540
is this book

08:46:13.540 --> 08:46:15.540
do you also get XP

08:46:15.540 --> 08:46:17.540
but you also get XP for hurting people

08:46:17.540 --> 08:46:19.540
what just wait until you find

08:46:19.540 --> 08:46:21.540
the one butthole

08:46:21.540 --> 08:46:23.540
who's

08:46:23.540 --> 08:46:25.540
just enough XP to level up

08:46:25.540 --> 08:46:27.540
oh no like seriously

08:46:27.540 --> 08:46:29.540
I don't mind talking about like oh

08:46:29.540 --> 08:46:31.540
I can teach you guys about debt and how it works

08:46:31.540 --> 08:46:33.540
and how credit cards work

08:46:33.540 --> 08:46:35.540
I genuinely believe credit cards

08:46:35.540 --> 08:46:37.540
are the absolute spawn of

08:46:37.540 --> 08:46:39.540
Satan for lack of better words

08:46:39.540 --> 08:46:41.540
they're terrible

08:46:41.540 --> 08:46:43.540
and once you get sucked into them

08:46:43.540 --> 08:46:45.540
and you're uneducated in them

08:46:45.540 --> 08:46:47.540
it's like obviously not part of your curriculum

08:46:47.540 --> 08:46:49.540
surprise surprise

08:46:49.540 --> 08:46:51.540
I wonder why

08:46:51.540 --> 08:46:53.540
oh that's right we're going down the conspiracy theory hole again

08:46:53.540 --> 08:46:55.540
like gee willikers I wonder why you're not told

08:46:55.540 --> 08:46:57.540
about how to do your taxes

08:46:57.540 --> 08:46:59.540
properly I wonder how you're not told to

08:46:59.540 --> 08:47:01.540
financially gee it's almost like

08:47:01.540 --> 08:47:03.540
the world runs if people

08:47:03.540 --> 08:47:05.540
are on debt because of the way society is

08:47:05.540 --> 08:47:07.540
set up because we love capitalism

08:47:09.540 --> 08:47:11.540
which is why I absolutely

08:47:11.540 --> 08:47:13.540
do not

08:47:13.540 --> 08:47:15.540
want any

08:47:15.540 --> 08:47:17.540
like tips or support

08:47:17.540 --> 08:47:19.540
you do not have to give me any monetary

08:47:19.540 --> 08:47:21.540
um

08:47:21.540 --> 08:47:23.540
for that kind of thing

08:47:23.540 --> 08:47:25.540
based

08:47:25.540 --> 08:47:27.540
oh literally

08:47:27.540 --> 08:47:29.540
I could go on a massive essay

08:47:29.540 --> 08:47:31.540
about that kind of thing

08:47:31.540 --> 08:47:33.540
you know what I'm in

08:47:33.540 --> 08:47:35.540
shut the fuck up

08:47:35.540 --> 08:47:37.540
put on

08:47:37.540 --> 08:47:39.540
and on

08:47:39.540 --> 08:47:41.540
shut the fuck up he goes

08:47:41.540 --> 08:47:43.540

08:47:43.540 --> 08:47:45.540
and on

08:47:45.540 --> 08:47:47.540
and on

08:47:47.540 --> 08:47:49.540
bend over

08:47:49.540 --> 08:47:51.540
bend over

08:47:51.540 --> 08:47:53.540
you're done

08:47:53.540 --> 08:47:55.540
you're done

08:47:55.540 --> 08:47:57.540
you're absolutely done bend over

08:47:57.540 --> 08:47:59.540
no I don't want to hear it

08:47:59.540 --> 08:48:01.540
I don't want to hear no

08:48:01.540 --> 08:48:03.540
that's terrible don't say that

08:48:03.540 --> 08:48:05.540
there's a safety word

08:48:05.540 --> 08:48:07.540
no we use that

if I can fix these achievements

09:00:19.540 --> 09:00:21.540
because there's really not a reason

09:00:21.540 --> 09:00:23.540
why they shouldn't be working

09:00:23.540 --> 09:00:25.540
however

09:00:25.540 --> 09:00:27.540

09:00:53.540 --> 09:00:55.540

09:01:11.540 --> 09:01:13.540

09:01:13.540 --> 09:01:15.540
to support your wishy day

09:01:15.540 --> 09:01:17.540

09:01:37.540 --> 09:01:39.540
oh

09:01:39.540 --> 09:01:41.540
can you do a collab with the girls where you do a round

09:01:41.540 --> 09:01:43.540
of terrible advice that would actually be quite funny

09:01:43.540 --> 09:01:45.540
I wouldn't mind doing that

09:01:45.540 --> 09:01:47.540
um

09:01:47.540 --> 09:01:49.540
our next collab is actually

09:01:49.540 --> 09:01:51.540
power washer sim where you get to see us all together

09:01:51.540 --> 09:01:53.540
because someone

09:01:53.540 --> 09:01:55.540
not naming names

09:01:55.540 --> 09:01:57.540
refling guessed the entire

09:01:57.540 --> 09:01:59.540
reason why we're playing power washer first

09:01:59.540 --> 09:02:01.540
out of all the games

09:02:01.540 --> 09:02:03.540
of course you had to figure out what the

09:02:03.540 --> 09:02:05.540
freaking plot was

09:02:05.540 --> 09:02:07.540
um

09:02:07.540 --> 09:02:09.540
but yes I will see you giffy givers

09:02:13.540 --> 09:02:15.540

am I allowed to do it tomorrow

09:02:19.540 --> 09:02:21.540
I'll still work my teeth

09:02:21.540 --> 09:02:23.540
but we'll do it on stream tomorrow like after

09:02:23.540 --> 09:02:25.540
the uh

09:02:25.540 --> 09:02:27.540
the foot part

09:02:27.540 --> 09:02:29.540
but thank you so much for having me

09:02:29.540 --> 09:02:31.540
thank you for letting me do another

09:02:31.540 --> 09:02:33.540
uh well it wasn't a fool

09:02:33.540 --> 09:02:35.540
endurance but it was almost a fool endurance

09:02:35.540 --> 09:02:37.540
it wasn't too bad um

09:02:37.540 --> 09:02:39.540
tomorrow is getting

09:02:39.540 --> 09:02:41.540
bulldozed for

09:02:41.540 --> 09:02:43.540
monetization celebration so be there

09:02:43.540 --> 09:02:45.540
or be a square

09:02:45.540 --> 09:02:47.540
um I won't be up for too long definitely

09:02:47.540 --> 09:02:49.540
non endurance stream but please don't worry

09:02:49.540 --> 09:02:51.540
if you can't make it the void will remain

09:02:51.540 --> 09:02:53.540
up I will be a good girl

09:02:55.540 --> 09:02:57.540
just like you you'll be a good boy

09:02:57.540 --> 09:02:59.540
wouldn't you

09:02:59.540 --> 09:03:01.540
or a good girl

09:03:03.540 --> 09:03:05.540
yeah only nine over stream

09:03:05.540 --> 09:03:07.540
yeah just uh just a little bit

09:03:09.540 --> 09:03:11.540
but yes we will be good together

09:03:11.540 --> 09:03:13.540
and we don't need to worry

09:03:13.540 --> 09:03:15.540
um it should remain up

09:03:15.540 --> 09:03:17.540
and

09:03:17.540 --> 09:03:19.540
uh I think that's everything I

09:03:19.540 --> 09:03:21.540
have to say it's possible

09:03:21.540 --> 09:03:23.540
do we have

09:03:23.540 --> 09:03:25.540
to stagger our monetization celebration

09:03:25.540 --> 09:03:27.540
days

09:03:27.540 --> 09:03:29.540
or can I

09:03:29.540 --> 09:03:31.540
if I did two if I did two hours

09:03:31.540 --> 09:03:33.540
and then perfectly read into chibi

09:03:33.540 --> 09:03:35.540
yeah that's fine

09:03:35.540 --> 09:03:37.540
if she decides to do hers as well

09:03:37.540 --> 09:03:39.540
because I'm not going to tell her not to do it you know

09:03:39.540 --> 09:03:41.540
I'm not going to say no

09:03:41.540 --> 09:03:43.540
six I was shaking my head

09:03:43.540 --> 09:03:45.540
I'm such a fake gamer I can't believe

09:03:45.540 --> 09:03:47.540
I'm such a rubbish streamer nine hours

09:03:47.540 --> 09:03:49.540
she said again

09:03:49.540 --> 09:03:51.540
okay I have to learn that being called a good boys

09:03:51.540 --> 09:03:53.540
okay I've learned

09:03:53.540 --> 09:03:55.540
that being called a good boys move

09:03:55.540 --> 09:03:57.540
oh it's supposed to make you weak in the knees

09:03:59.540 --> 09:04:01.540
you're supposed to get weak in the knees for me

09:04:01.540 --> 09:04:03.540
it's simple okay

09:04:03.540 --> 09:04:05.540
you behave

09:04:05.540 --> 09:04:07.540
you get rewarded

09:04:07.540 --> 09:04:09.540
a very fair

09:04:09.540 --> 09:04:11.540
and simple exchange

09:04:11.540 --> 09:04:13.540
oh you

09:04:13.540 --> 09:04:15.540
do have to go to 599

09:04:15.540 --> 09:04:17.540
to avoid gifting you're joking

09:04:19.540 --> 09:04:21.540
please tell me you're trolling me and it's not 599

09:04:23.540 --> 09:04:25.540
is it actually 599

09:04:27.540 --> 09:04:29.540
I don't think I can charge that much

09:04:29.540 --> 09:04:31.540
that's not fair

09:04:39.540 --> 09:04:41.540
why

09:04:41.540 --> 09:04:43.540
did gifting change

09:04:43.540 --> 09:04:45.540
does gifting not go to the lowest tier

09:04:45.540 --> 09:04:47.540
are we sure gifting doesn't do the lowest tier

09:04:49.540 --> 09:04:51.540
what's gifting so when someone

09:04:51.540 --> 09:04:53.540
is monetized you can gift

09:04:53.540 --> 09:04:55.540
membership to other people

09:04:55.540 --> 09:04:57.540
and

09:04:59.540 --> 09:05:01.540
I specifically

09:05:01.540 --> 09:05:03.540
I'm having

09:05:03.540 --> 09:05:05.540
you know what

09:05:05.540 --> 09:05:07.540
we could test it on me

09:05:09.540 --> 09:05:11.540
we could test it on me tomorrow

09:05:13.540 --> 09:05:15.540
I know how to

09:05:15.540 --> 09:05:17.540
dance the line

09:05:17.540 --> 09:05:19.540
okay

09:05:19.540 --> 09:05:21.540
we'll test it on me tomorrow we'll see what happens

09:05:21.540 --> 09:05:23.540
strongy speaks

09:05:23.540 --> 09:05:25.540
English

09:05:25.540 --> 09:05:27.540
strongy speaks and my heart becomes weak

09:05:27.540 --> 09:05:29.540
100% sure it doesn't

09:05:29.540 --> 09:05:31.540
seen tons of channels with 199

09:05:31.540 --> 09:05:33.540
it goes from 499

09:05:35.540 --> 09:05:37.540
let me cook

09:05:37.540 --> 09:05:39.540
and I'll put the price that I want

09:05:39.540 --> 09:05:41.540
and I think it's fair and we'll see what happens

09:05:41.540 --> 09:05:43.540
and if it's just an absolute cluster

09:05:43.540 --> 09:05:45.540
minuster then

09:05:45.540 --> 09:05:47.540
we'll deal with the fallout on me at least

09:05:47.540 --> 09:05:49.540
and then the girls are unaffected by

09:05:49.540 --> 09:05:51.540
any fallout

09:05:53.540 --> 09:05:55.540
the fear

09:05:55.540 --> 09:05:57.540
of that thingy but I've never seen it happen

09:05:57.540 --> 09:05:59.540
nah and it's like

09:05:59.540 --> 09:06:01.540
you have to turn on being able to be gifted

09:06:01.540 --> 09:06:03.540
yes I would

09:06:03.540 --> 09:06:05.540
I would put it on because it's a big income source

09:06:05.540 --> 09:06:07.540
and

09:06:07.540 --> 09:06:09.540
I have terrible news I spent a lot of money

09:06:09.540 --> 09:06:11.540
I just

09:06:11.540 --> 09:06:13.540
yeah

09:06:13.540 --> 09:06:15.540
feeler wasn't cheap let's put it that way

09:06:17.540 --> 09:06:19.540
yes not even fallout in New Vegas

09:06:21.540 --> 09:06:23.540
what about fallout in New Vegas

09:06:23.540 --> 09:06:25.540
I've seen

09:06:25.540 --> 09:06:27.540
399 and 799

09:06:27.540 --> 09:06:29.540
that's rubbish that's not nice

09:06:29.540 --> 09:06:31.540
if they use it they have to turn on being

09:06:31.540 --> 09:06:33.540
oh they have to turn on being able to receive gifts as well

09:06:33.540 --> 09:06:35.540
okay okay well that's

09:06:35.540 --> 09:06:37.540
a team effort

09:06:37.540 --> 09:06:39.540
just a wee bit of money

09:06:39.540 --> 09:06:41.540
just a wee bit of pocket money

09:06:41.540 --> 09:06:43.540
that's a lot

09:06:43.540 --> 09:06:45.540
right

09:06:45.540 --> 09:06:47.540
I will let

09:06:47.540 --> 09:06:49.540
you be carried away

09:06:49.540 --> 09:06:51.540
