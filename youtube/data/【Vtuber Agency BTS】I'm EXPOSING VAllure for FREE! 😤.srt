1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, A.C. finish up.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Good A.C.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
She wasn't supposed to do that shit.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There you go.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ah, I'm a fucking talk of the word.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I can hear myself.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Mike, can I hear myself?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, okay, okay.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Right.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ugh.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How did A.C. do in her 2.0?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
She was adorable, right?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
She was freaking amazing.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I turned down my music this time because during debut it was unbelievably loud and I didn't

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
catch it.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Like a dumbass.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But hey ho.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Right.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to do two streams.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This stream is dedicated to exposing VLR.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The YouTube agency.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The YouTube agency.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That VTuber agency, okay?

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now, I'm very unprofessional.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm very scatterbrained.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm very XYZ, you know.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, I am going to try my best to stick to a one hour of just exposing the agency.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will talk.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will take questions at the end.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can see chat.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can read chat.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can interact with you.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
During debut, you're not really supposed to interact that much.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But I can 100% completely tune in on your forehead and all that.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So, don't worry.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't worry.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It will be three hours long.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Bruh.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, she be.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm trying to read, isn't it?

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's why I'm like, right.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
One hour for this and then one hour for my thing.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Right.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's a Z?

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is that a rune in the, what?

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What?

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't be trolling with my accent already.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Right, right, right.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
One, one, one, one, one.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's begin at the very start.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And by start, I mean whatever I could gather notes on very quickly.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, we start with the application.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Sorry.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm rubbing my eyeball.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Currently got a fricking rogue eyelash in it.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm jumping straight into it.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not stalling.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And this is at the wrong part.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay.

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm talking about the applications first.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hold on.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let me just, okay.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Good.

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's not the starting one.

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is the starting one.

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So, on the VLR website, you will notice there was a few things slightly different than

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
what the average VTuber agency asks for.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay.

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Most VTuber agencies go, hey, we don't care what gender you are.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Thanks to entertainment laws, I could say whamen only.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sorry, guys.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But you want to start a male VTuber agency?

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Absolutely.

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Nothing's holding you back.

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I assure you.

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
However, me, I'm looking for fannies to join.

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay.

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You know what?

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But we also had more requirements as well.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay.

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Those requirements were you had to have experience being a naughty, naughty.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Doesn't matter what kind.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
As long as you had some sort of variation, you're going to be comfortable with it.

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, just think about the application pool and how it gets lower and lower.

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And most VTuber agencies, for whatever reason, lie to your face and go, you can apply even

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
if you don't have any experience.

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Liars.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They are wasting your time.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Do not believe them and do not apply to agencies that say that you do not have to be a content

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
creator prior to applying for them.

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're wasting your time.

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They are wasting your time and they do not deserve.

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You don't deserve that.

102
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Seriously, you don't deserve that.

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's such a freaking waste, okay?

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And the Veiler website had a redonkulous amount of information on it or they knew the split

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
off the bat or they knew what was happening with merchandise sales off the bat.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They are at freaking, put my soul into making that website as clear as possible.

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay?

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So, no time wasters.

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Give or take, we had 320 applications.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Lovely girls.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
However, that meant for every one model.

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was a preselected talent if you didn't know.

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hi, I was inks, codename inks.

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah.

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So, for every one model, we had 34 girls essentially battling it out to be the right fit.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And it was not easy.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, it was not easy.

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
She put that whole straw noose in our website.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Wait, that's inks?

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I shut up.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right.

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
For the most popular picked character, design wise,

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
what was she be?

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't be fooled by that color.

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's not pins.

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's a light blue for any.

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay?

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So, the majority said put me on anyone.

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Put me where you fit.

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You want to fit me.

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay?

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So, ropes was the most picked.

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It ropes.

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
She be was the most picked.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And then I see was the second.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And then Azura was the third.

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then Mercy was the second.

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And then the very last picked.

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh dear, if they didn't like your silhouette.

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm like, are you kidding me?

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I love creepy little girl designs.

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm just going to leave it at that.

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I love little creepy things.

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a fucking gorgeous design.

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't care what anyone said.

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No one wanted to be me.

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Shonton behavior.

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Shonton.

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And then obviously I cannot show the fricking private information of those who applied.

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So, I can just show you these fun pie charts about the application process.

152
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So, people say the reason why Veeler asked if your PC was weak,

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
because we have the funds to purchase an entire new PC for you,

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
which we did for one talent.

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, enjoy that, the new PC hen.

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But yeah, we had the funds to completely give you the equipment you needed.

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They all got three deals that they can use for ASMR streams.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They'll let SMBs for streaming if they didn't have it.

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So, we also gave a sign-on bonus as well,

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
because we had two months to kind of prepare for the debuts and all that.

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And it's quite a lot to ask someone to, you know, kind of give your full focus,

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
if you will, to a new agency where there's not an income source.

163
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So, all the girls also got a sign-on bonus of 420 US dollars,

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
but I don't think any agency has done before.

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And literally, it's like the most basic common courtesy.

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Like, seriously. Like, I guess.

167
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Seriously, Veeler, it's planning to get any money, because it sounds like it is...

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, well, we'll talk about the profits a little bit.

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I also, in the application form, you could tell us if you wanted to have a callback,

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
if we find you might be suitable for a later character if we were to expand.

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Now, I'm going to say this publicly right now.

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No one has been contacted for a callback.

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The reason for that is because it's a bit of a cheek to have someone basically wait for a year

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
for a non-guaranteed slot in an agency.

175
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I didn't want anyone hanging about maybe pausing plans they have,

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
like, because some people might want to, you know, get a 2.0 model,

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
some people want to maybe start up as a new VTuber, like, type thing with a new persona.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Like, I just didn't want anyone to be at that stage.

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So, I'll just say publicly now, no one has been contacted for a thingy.

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But yes.

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, so that was kind of the application process.

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The interview process.

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm more than happy for the girls to talk about the interview process with me.

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Basically, if you're interested in Veeler, I was the barrier, okay?

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I was the one reviewing you and looking at your content, if you applied,

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and I was like you and you, you know.

187
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a bit awkward.

188
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll say this part out loud.

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It was a bit morally, hmm,

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
because I was judging VTubers that had way more streaming experience than me

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
to be like, oh, you're worthy to come in or not.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And it's like, hmm, it wasn't a nice feeling.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Kind of like being like, no, but you can't want me.

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Right, okay, questions.

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Most basic, why are you called Veeler?

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now, check out the V at the start, virtual,

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
as most agencies start with a V for virtual, okay?

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And then the A.

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay, now put V and A together, okay?

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What do you get?

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You get voice acting, hmm, voice acting, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, and the girls are doing amateur voice acting audios.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh my God, oh my God, you did it.

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You did it.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You put it together too.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Also, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's read it together.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's read it together.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
V, okay, and then imagine if there was an imaginary dash.

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Allure, allure, as if the girls were alluring.

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh my, oh my God.

212
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Put it together.

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We've done it, lads.

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We've cracked the fucking case.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay, that's why it's called failure.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's no other thing to it, okay?

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I thought it was pretty self-explanatory,

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but it wasn't, okay?

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It wasn't.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I was like, V, allure, okay?

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
V, allure.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But we've got so many different pronunciations.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think if you have an American, you're like, V, allure.

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And it's like, I never really thought about other accents saying it

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
because I was like, hmm, one accent, but here you go.

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Anya, questions?

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why are you called Viller?

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How hand on are you with the talents?

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The talents can do whatever the fuck they want.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They do not come to me for permission.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
They don't have to come to me.

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Shawnee, I want to do this.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I want to do it.

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The only thing they come to me with is they go,

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I want a project.

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I want this.

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I want that.

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want this asset.

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then they come to me and I sugar mummy them.

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And I'll be like, there you go, darlin'.

241
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Allure's 10, pop your pop.

242
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The girls do what they want.

243
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They do not need permission for in real life hand-to-cam streams,

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
for example.

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
None of that shit.

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You guys have to understand,

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
we're all adults here.

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I am not going to treat anyone like they're a fucking child

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and they need permission from me to work.

250
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay?

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because as it stands, they're, you know,

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
doing work and streaming and all that,

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you do not need permission to work.

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay?

255
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So we don't do none of that shit around here.

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
One of the funniest comments I had seen so far

257
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
was, uh, management's going to run away with the money, aren't we?

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh, you've caught me.

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You've caught me.

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Was the 80-20 split showing my corporation greed?

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Was the 100% merch sales to the talent showing my corporation greed?

262
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh no!

263
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, my plans have been foiled.

264
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You've seen right through my plans to steal from these girls.

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mate.

266
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Mate.

267
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Mate.

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You have no concept of how much love has gone into this.

269
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You have no concept.

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But thank you for your comment.

271
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The entire development team had a nice chuckle at you, mate.

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That was some basic questions, okay?

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Now, the accusations.

274
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The accusations, I can't outrun them.

276
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's time.

277
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can't believe I'm saying this.

278
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But it's true.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The background music's are based on Sonic Heroes' OST.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It was the autism, your honor.

282
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I couldn't stop it.

283
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay, I'm sorry, but Mercy's background music is based after

284
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Billet Station from Sonic Heroes' OST.

285
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
MAP's is after Mystic Mansion.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm so sorry.

287
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Azura's is after Frog Forest.

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And Shavey's, it's after Strange Guys and AC and Casino Park.

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And then me, Bingo Highway.

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because, you know, Bingo Highway has a little bit of ear to ear.

292
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And then it also has it in my background music.

293
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You can really hear it in Emmys and Mercy's, for example.

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Okay, it's true.

295
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's true.

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I brought to them that your honor.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes.

298
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, you started VTuber Agency and then you made the background music

299
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
based after an old game called Sonic Heroes' OST.

300
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, I did.

301
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What are you going to do about it, huh?

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Are you going to fart?

303
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Are you going to fart and sniff it or something?

304
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Right, these are spoilers.

305
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Spoilers up ahead.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Spoilers.

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Okay.

308
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
These are badges and emote spoilers.

309
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Now, because of the way the agency is set,

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
so the girls couldn't pick their emotes at the stage,

311
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
so I got them emotes.

312
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I just guessed what emotes they'd like.

313
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So some big spoilers for emotes ahead.

314
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
If you don't want to know what the emotes are for when their membership open,

315
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
please look away.

316
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm going to burp in a second.

317
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, beautiful.

318
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I also have badges, okay?

319
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There's also going to be badges.

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Spoilers.

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Spoilers.

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Spoilers.

323
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, wait.

324
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No.

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No.

326
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No.

327
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Azura.

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Azura.

329
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Not right now.

330
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Azura.

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No.

332
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I say no.

333
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No.

334
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Right.

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Here we go.

336
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Okay.

337
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Hold on.

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hold on.

339
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hold on.

340
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Special shout-out to the concept artists of the Allure.

341
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
His name is Squishy Girl.

342
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So these are just the concept artists for Azura's membership link.

343
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay.

344
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hmm.

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
A bit of milk themed.

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay.

347
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
A bit of milk themed.

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Hmm.

349
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay.

350
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This is...

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh!

352
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Little acicle.

353
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Acicle is a little baby polar bear with a dummy or a binky if you're American.

354
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And then it goes into two years.

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We can't super chat.

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No.

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh!

358
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I will talk about that.

359
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm at 2.0.

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But right now I need to speed run through this because I'm going to start yapping.

361
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Little emmers.

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Emmers is pumpkin themed.

363
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I absolutely adore her pumpkin little bunches.

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay.

366
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
These are already fully ordered and everything.

367
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So don't worry.

368
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The girls are...

369
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I've planned this out.

370
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I've had plenty of time.

371
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I've planned this out.

372
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000

373
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay.

375
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They have just been birthed from my loins.

376
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
As you can tell.

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000

378
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I will answer any questions at the end.

385
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Right now I'm just trying to zoom through it.

386
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000

You want a gimp mask on?

394
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000

399
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000

402
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you trolling me?

403
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm being trolled.

404
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I just got trolled reading that.

405
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000

406
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Uh.

407
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000

408
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,740
But if you look in the corner, it says, this shell you waiting for.

409
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
Join up nowhere else.

410
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm not squinting around.

411
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The shape remains as of this.

412
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, right.

413
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay.

414
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I just get confused.

415
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I just get confused.

416
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, actually that's another thing.

417
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going to bully Emmy with my Scottish French at some point.

418
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I absolutely love it.

419
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I love it.

420
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay.

421
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Now, look away if you don't want spoilers for the emotes that I got for the girls.

422
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay.

423
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,760
I just want to say I bought, I got these in advance.

424
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,320
I didn't meet the girls at this point.

425
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
I hadn't met them.

426
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
I got these in advance for the girls get to pick all the emotes that follow afterwards.

427
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay.

428
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So these are spoilers.

429
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Is she biting your arm?

430
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is there a given up?

431
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Or in her voice?

432
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I can't do it.

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Is there a given up?

434
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Or in her voice?

435
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I can't do it.

436
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
She be bonk.

437
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm fine.

438
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You can call me a long bonk.

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Loading for Emmy.

440
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And then eh.

448
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000

449
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Just eh.

450
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And then ah.

451
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm just going to like make the sound that I think these emotes portray.

452
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay.

453
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Ah.

454
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Go.

456
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Go.

457
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Go.

458
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Go.

459
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Go.

460
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Go.

461
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Go.

462
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Go.

463
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Go.

464
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Go.

465
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Go.

466
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Go.

467
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Go.

468
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No, that's sounds like

469
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
the reflex.

470
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
對.

471
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

472
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes.

473
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes.

474
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes.

475
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Her.

476
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Guess I have enough.

477
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yes.

478
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes.

479
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes.

480
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Ah

481
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
We still got a few more go

482
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I

483
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,020
Don't know how to make the sound of a blade swing

484
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh

485
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Last one

486
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,960
Did you like it? Oh, when I lose track and my hypnosis comes on

487
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Do you like that? Yeah, I was good

488
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,440
Okay, a little spoiler in the most as I said the girls get to pick their emotes

489
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,920
After this next batch because obviously I had to order it in of the rounds because I didn't know them yet

490
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,480
Lore okay, so this is this is super behind-the-scenes stuff. So again squishy girl

491
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:16,800
Conceptualize the lore so this is what an example of a lore storyboard looks like I'm giving you the hints

492
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
So this is a zero for example

493
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,760
So as you can see at the script right away the earth was driven L baron in its infancy then from dust to darkness was the first family

494
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,160
So this is called concept art for the lore that was given to T Tema Chi Tema Chi

495
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,960
I would say T Matt T, but that's my accent

496
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,840
So that was this is these they're kind of it gives an idea of Tamachi of what she

497
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,840
Chant

498
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Chant

499
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,680
Let's go squishy girls and chap, but you know, he's

500
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,800
So I'll give you a very quick example of what half wait hold on hold on hold on

501
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Let me click let me click let me click let me click

502
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,400
So to give you a very quick example, I can only do it for my lore

503
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,080
But here are the first three concept panels so ghoul did the concept panels along with the script

504
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,440
So concept one two and three and then to match you saw it and then come oh shit

505
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,620
It's a bit big. Oh down a minute. Hold on. Hold on. It's very scuffed

506
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,800
So to match he comes back with the sketch and you know

507
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
It's so literally we go from

508
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,640
Well the top corner one to to the sketch so she comes back with a sketch absolutely beautiful garden

509
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:50,000
Beautiful beautiful and she then with the approval of the storyboard and sketch then the full images come through

510
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,720
And these come through all layered these are all there the reason why we could get the little images to move about was

511
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,880
To match he just works so diligently so hard. They were an absolute pleasure to work with I cannot recommend to match

512
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
She enough for like

513
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,760
You know, I gave her a lot of work. I could I could you know, I was insane work

514
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,760
But as you can see from the finished result of the lures to matchy

515
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,880
And beautiful that I look five star meal all the Michelin stars or however

516
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Michelin stars work

517
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,520
But yes, so that's the behind-the-scenes of kind of the development of the lore so again squishy girl

518
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,520
Not only did he do the storyboard?

519
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,520
He also did the scripts in the background lures of the girls

520
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,160
I will come back to the development of the girls very shortly

521
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,600
And if you didn't know the merches are now out for the girls, but again in order to help artists it's so

522
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,760
To make things such a smooth process behind the scene and

523
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,240
Having a concept artist to give the actual artists

524
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,760
An idea of what you want helps so I hope I'm not spoiling the merch that's coming out, but this is a Zura

525
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,440
Little aces cons these are concepts of the merchandise that you see on who we mark it right now. I'll talk about it now and

526
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,000
Then a little mersey and she be and

527
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,680
Yeah, again, these are just concepts a beautiful behind-the-scenes stuff

528
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,240
It's really nice getting a thingy a little thingy so early development

529
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,200
Okay, now now you're gonna start cringing at a few of the things that come up shortly, but

530
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Mmm, please please read please read

00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:44,680
Right, okay, this is where the cringe comes in. This is where the really the developmental cringe comes in, okay

542
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,680
So I'm gonna read it out to you. Don't worry if you can't read neither can I but I'll try my best to read it out

543
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,440
So when it comes to concepts, okay, as you'll notice these girls don't have names because

544
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,800
Because the girls started without names. That's how it was

545
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,040
So for the lore for girl one, it was it was the best we got to hang out together

546
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,720
We ordered food and watch anime all snuggled up

547
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,840
I couldn't have asked for anything more that night

548
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,800
It was a shame that the truth never came out that I could never tell my redacted that I love him before it was too late

549
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,000
It's not fair now. I'm some what I know I'm somewhere. Don't recognize and I'll never see him again

550
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,280
You'll still watch over me from where you are now, though

551
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,480
Hmm wonder wonder who that is. Um, but these are kind of description lores very quick

552
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
girl lore 2

553
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,680
When there's no one around to spoil what am I gonna do with myself?

554
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,680
I've got no purpose if I don't have a sweet heart to show my love, okay

555
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,440
That was I was a Zura that was a Zura that's where she started from see

556
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,600
Asura was given more of a kind of servant goddess role, but that definitely didn't really come into play

557
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,360
Mersey oh then pie. I know you're around here

558
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,840
You're playing a game with me aren't you thinking you can take me to an unfamiliar surrounding so I'd stop use flash, baby

559
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,280
I love you far too much to ever give up the chase. Isn't it fun when your heart is practically beating out of your chest?

560
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,720
Manic I do manic laughter, but Mersey absolutely fucking

561
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,360
She mugs me with her laugh. Oh wait, you're not Senpai, but you could be from the ones of you know, if you don't know mercy kind of

562
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,960
You know, you know how it goes

563
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,360
for

564
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
for

565
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,320
For okay for I have

566
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,640
You're gonna find out why four is so confusing four is icy

567
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,680
I quit whoever made this game who even made this game and read that wrong

568
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,440
Whoever even made this game in the first place

569
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,760
What's the point and putting achievements in a game if only 0.2% of the player base can even achieve it screw this

570
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
I'm going on a really

571
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,360
Website, okay. Now. What's the category tonight? Oh, let's do a random rule at our discord, okay?

572
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,600
As you can see aces come a very long way, okay, that's not aces lore at all. That's not our concept

573
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
We're not even there. Okay

574
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:25,320
Lore 5 I cannot for the life of me understand how guys work. How do their brains even function?

575
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,200
If only there was some sort of way

576
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,880
I could get them to be truthful with me

577
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
Um and

578
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,520
Yeah, so I always started with a hypno theme. Obviously I got to pick what the fuck I want to be because I was there from the start

579
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,000
I was always going to have hypno. I just didn't know what angle we were going for

580
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,920
and then

581
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:55,080
I got conceptualized to wanting to kill all humanity. So yeah, I didn't do that part by the way before you're like, oh my god

582
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
now

583
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,560
Sorry, I'm rubbing my face heat and then six. Um

584
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,200
Six, uh, it should be yeah, um, I've had it bunny boys are pathetic. They can never keep up with me

585
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,240
And I don't know why I bother wasting my time. I just need something different

586
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:19,000
Human males surely can keep up with this stamina of my needs type thing. Okay, so that's how the girls started

587
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Okay, they all started deeply departed

588
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,480
So that's it. All right. Okay. This is a really fun. This is I hated naming everyone. I hate that

589
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:36,440
I hate that the the reason why you don't see me be zoo right now is because me be zoo was named correctly

590
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,320
Azura, you were a nightmare to name. Oh my god. I went through so many names

591
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,360
I literally came up with stacey milkerton

592
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,360
Azura, you were so hard to name for no reason

593
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:59,640
You can literally see how desperate I was getting through your name. I was like stacey milkerton. Miss milkerton milk the pillow show

594
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Show me darling in french

595
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Yeah, right. She's a goat god

596
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:11,320
Faunus in this milfu in this milf shoe milf is in milf for you

597
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,680
Fondue la fondue la bosom azura

598
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,440
Daily, which is the wrong spelling in french and then finally we got to azura delay. Oh

599
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,320
My god. Do you know do you see the techniques to fondue la bosom as well?

600
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
That's because I approved

601
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,480
That name for azura as fondue la bosom

602
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
What was I thinking?

603
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Right

604
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,240
Okay, now this one's about this is a real behind the scenes lore

605
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,160
Mersey was originally stavita

606
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,640
Right

607
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,600
bread

608
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,360
What was I thinking and then if she was eastern european, we were going to change it to stavita

609
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,040
What was that smooton and then I

610
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,960
Approved the name karam beat so instead of karam bet as in sharp weapon

611
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
beat

612
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,800
So the fun fact is that it's not a fun fact. I'm such a dumb ass

613
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Karam's name got past development

614
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,760
So mersey was called karam until about a month ago. It was awful

615
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,640
Don't let me cook ever again. I'm not naming anyone after this

616
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
right ac

617
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,000
ac is a lie. Do you want to know what ac's real name was?

618
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Joy stick with an eye

619
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:52,680
ac was not developed as a polar bear. I'm going to show you her developmental are very shortly. Her name was joy stick

620
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Yes, that's true

621
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Now ac uh, umka is russian unbelievably

622
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,880
What are the odds because ac does speak russian but her concept did name was always ac we liked ac from the star

623
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Okay, we liked ac from the star

624
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:15,720
So it was ac umka, which I think means bear or paw and russian. I can't remember. It's one or the other something like that

625
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
and and then ac show

626
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,040
um

627
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,000
For ac hot as in opposites, but she was always going to be a polar bear

628
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,720
uh, and then

629
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
We got bander

630
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,920
I feel like bander is that it's like a kind of mythological

631
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,320
angle

632
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:41,080
And then we got ac snow paws and I was like that's absolutely adorable. I love it

633
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,600
It's easy to remember like I know some people are dogging on the names like I'm sorry

634
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:53,560
But we're an english-speaking agency. I don't see the point of having like yuku solavia and a surname

635
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Like in japanese, I just I'm like i'm not gonna remember it joystick child

636
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,600
Um

637
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,640
Me I was pretty quick. I knew I was going to be strongy off the bat

638
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,520
I knew I was going to name myself after my dad's gamer tag strontium

639
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,080
It's not his actual gamer tag before anyone worries that like his literal thing. Don't worry

640
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,280
I was always going to be strongy, but it was like I don't know where 365

641
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,920
I actually don't remember 365 at all. Don't remember a spiral swirl notice the check mark against swirl

642
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,800
That's because I approved it and then you know, I was a cut official

643
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,120
I was like, you know what strongy calls locket and boys

644
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,320
And then she be because of her shabari rope. She was always going to be she be like she be

645
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,720
um

646
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,520
And then we really liked cotton, but obviously there's a

647
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,400
You know cotton tails of a va. So we didn't want to step on anyone's tail. You know I'm shining

648
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,600
and

649
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,200
So we got cotton bud and then we got cotton maw, but that didn't work and then we got cotton bum

650
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,120
And then we're like that makes perfect sense because she has a tail if you didn't know three members avail or have a tail

651
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,880
She's a distant relative. Yeah, honestly, it's fine. We were not wanting to step on anyone name wise

652
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,880
But yeah, as I said, emmy is not here because emmy's name got nailed off the bat

653
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,400
I don't care what anyone says. I have never named someone more perfect than emmy, but I promise you I'm not naming anyone else after this because

654
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,240
I

655
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,640
People are kind of like, oh why why the french route?

656
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,080
um

657
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,040
I don't know. I think it's pretty easy to remember everyone's name like that clap along with me chat

658
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,120
emmy

659
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,720
ac

660
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,160
she be

661
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,760
strongy

662
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,280
merci

663
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Azara

664
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,320
Like these names are not hard to freaking remember in my opinion. Okay

665
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Yeah, um

666
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,480
Okay, this is just about a feedback if anyone reaches out to the emails

667
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:52,120
The dev team get back to me a lot. Um, if you are applying to be an editor, some people do still submit it

668
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,760
We're always kind of looking for clippers editors so you can submit yourself

669
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,360
If you apply and be like, hey, I want to be an editor right?

670
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:09,960
And you don't attach a portfolio or any evidence history of editing or a youtube where you've done like a playlist of edits

671
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,440
Bro, we're not gonna reply. You're wasting your time

672
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,480
You need apply. Yeah, do not apply with

673
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,800
Fondle is crazy. Right, right. I know it was a bad name. Okay. Let me let me care. Um

674
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,720
We've had some music creators reach out. That's fantastic that do original songs. So for the vealor members that want to pursue

675
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:38,680
Um singing, uh, there might be original songs coming out. There's a few song covers. I'm gonna try and I think she

676
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,280
Has an interest. I'm gonna try and poke a zura to do some song covers or maybe some lullabies because her voice is just

677
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
for it and

678
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:53,480
Uh, hot to the cleavage right enough to uh, I tried my best but a zura was hard to name but come on a zura duly

679
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,560
literally, uh

680
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
goddess of milk if you will

681
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,880
um

682
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,240
This is the most embarrassing part

683
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,480
The first name a concept for the agency was V sucky and now we are all succubus

684
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,400
And the motto would you survive if you met one of us?

685
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:28,440
Like so the concept was like succubus blood was like seeping into these girls somehow

686
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
because I don't like when

687
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,120
Vtuber stories like all connect like me and Icy would never meet because I'm in the water and she's on land type thing

688
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,880
Like I don't like when agencies like force the lore to come together

689
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
So a concept of that and I was like

690
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,880
No, we're not so before anyone makes fun of vealor vealor terrible name

691
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,440
We could have been v sucky. Okay as in short for virtual succubus

692
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,080
So, uh, I will not be taking any statements and things. Okay

693
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
You're all done. Okay

694
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,520
This is just a fun behind-the-scenes special shout out to yumi yumi works

695
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,120
They are magnificent and made all over loading screens

696
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,120
As you can see these are just the concepts, but they're still stunning and it's nice to see behind-the-scenes stuff, but um

697
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,920
Mercy's was influenced by the joker

698
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:30,840
Being surrounded by knives in the batman scene unironically acy if you didn't catch acy's

699
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,920
um

700
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,840
loading screen is a bit mella melancholy melancholy

701
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,840
um

702
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,040
where

703
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,240
the

704
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,280
A

705
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,800
The borealis that comes up lights up her thingy

706
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,360
But hers is a bit more sad because she's just left her polar bear family

707
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,160
melancholic

708
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,480
Isn't colic when babies are crying

709
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:03,560
Aurora borealis I always want to say ariola borealis and I'm pretty sure that means a nip, but I'm trying. I'm trying, bro

710
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Uh, she be nailed off the bat

711
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,920
Um, I wanted everyone's mascot to be a part of the loading screen because I just find that stuff adorable

712
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,320
And yes, viola did premake all the mascots. Uh, emmy uh elected to change hers. Absolutely fine. No problems

713
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,240
Like we're not a dictating agency. The girls can come to me and be like, I didn't like that. I want something else. Yeah, that's fine. Um

714
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,760
Uh, Azura, you'll notice did get a new scene that she used on debut

715
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,720
um

716
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,200
But yeah, this is just behind the scenes kind of this is the oh my god, it's dempa fish

717
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:42,840
Surprise, you know how on debut I was like, I have ASMR clubs planned with other vtubers. Yeah, so a dempa fish is one of them

718
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,880
um

719
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,640
But yes, this is just kind of behind the scenes aren't just to see how it comes together. No, right. Okay. Okay, this next bit

720
00:37:51,880 --> 00:38:00,200
So everyone likes the designs. Yeah, all the designs are 10 out of 10, aren't they? Oh, we just love the design

721
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
We did not

722
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,040
We did not look like how we look no

723
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,520
Okay

724
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,760
We do not look like how we look no

725
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,360
Yeah

726
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,640
Yikes

727
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Now Emi and Azura

728
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:27,640
Emi and Azura. Yeah, uh, I just yeah, so as you can see I see it's an even in the lineup

729
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,840
Yet five is me

730
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,320
Uh, I always had bunch double bunches in my hair

731
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:39,480
So I have two bunches in my hair like the seashells are just accessories, but there's actually two bubbles. But yeah

732
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
Sheebie was also

733
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,760
the heck

734
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
with uh triple C's

735
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,800
Uh, Azura and thingy, but then you know things changed. So then the next lineup we're like, right change it

736
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,320
Next lineup aces with us. Let's go

737
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
um

738
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,280
Uh

739
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,720
Mercy's hair has changed so she no longer has drills

740
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,040
Uh, I've changed a bit. I've got like these weird spirals in my hair, but I quite like that. It's quite unique

741
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Sheebie is still purple

742
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,760
We're changing you but we do have ac developed. Okay. We have ac developed now. Okay change again

743
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,560
All right, body type change on sheebie

744
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,600
Strone complete change on strone

745
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,720
Mercy again still the wrong hair color

746
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:40,760
And then next okay, let's try again and as you can see hates were established and names were established

747
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,560
My height got changed. Sheebie's got changed. Azura became taller because

748
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,800
We made her a giant test. If you didn't know Azura can

749
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,280
Be as tall as a skyscraper. Now, there's not an indefinite height, but yeah

750
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,280
um

751
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
Mercy's coming out with a

752
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:09,000
Short very shortly about her being blonde. You'll like it. Um, and then here we go big changes on me and sheebie at the same time

753
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,720
so

754
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Sheebie got her hair spirals

755
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,880
Um her ears

756
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,000
Concepted and then I started to come to life. Um, as you can see I have little shoesies on

757
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,560
The shoesies got taken away

758
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,080
Why am I in a different style?

759
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:31,000
Well, I had to go a different concept artist because we were struggling at the time. Um, and then eventually

760
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,680
ac was getting developed

761
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,800
So this that was her first development footage of her model that kind of transition you see there

762
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
As you see Mercy's hair is still wrong

763
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,680
They took your kicks. I know they yanked my shoes. Give me them back

764
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,480
Actually, oh my god, I should be like, uh, right there we go. So

765
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
We're going to take it from the top

766
00:40:53,560 --> 00:41:00,040
The first girl developed. Uh, what am I doing for time? Oh, I'm actually not doing bad for time. Let's go school

767
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,720
Um

768
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,920
I was good. I was good. Uh, right. We're going to take it from this top

769
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,640
Emmy was the first conceptualized veiler

770
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,600
girl, okay

771
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:20,360
But she ain't look like that the star boom. Oh wait wrong one wrong one. Hold on. Hold on out. Wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

772
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,800
Hold on. Don't don't like don't like no. No, no, right. There we go. Boom

773
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
This is the first

774
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,560
official concept of emmy

775
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,840
Yeah, that's what emmy emmy looks like at the start

776
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,080
Mm-hmm. You can kind of see it that she's got the sneakers

777
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,480
She's got the uh, the hoodie uh, the hair is orange

778
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,560
but uh, it's giving it's giving best

779
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,320
Frendo next door. It's not giving emmy isn't

780
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Frankie. Oh, honestly. Yeah

781
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,840
I said squish her down make her a wee one

782
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,720
So then we got her squished down

783
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:07,800
Uh, we're starting to get uh, definitely getting her silhouette going on but no pins. We do have her uh, how you call them?

784
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,160
Uh

785
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,880
Pumpkins in her hair have been established at this point. Yeah, she got hydraulic pressed

786
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,400
Uh, and then we're like and back to the drawing board. Go next

787
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,800
It was like hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. We're cooking. We are cooking by gas, okay

788
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,240
So we were getting very close as you can see by this design very very close in the concept art

789
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
So then we gave her the old

790
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:40,280
Overwatch skin if you don't know overwatch sell skins by recoloring them. She got recolored

791
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,360
Uh, there we go. That was it. That was it. Boom recolored and just like that. There's emmy. That's emmy

792
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,920
There's emmy

793
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
There she is

794
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,680
So gave her the old overwatch skin color change and boom

795
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,320
Ta-da

796
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:03,240
Uh, and then there is some behind scenes uh banner. This commission wasn't able to be finished. Um

797
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,040
But I thought to show it off anyway. This is by papa perito

798
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,000
Incredibly good artist sadly ran out of time

799
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
due to life constraints. However

800
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,200
I know you won't be able to tell but this was originally going to be your banner and it's actually a skyroom reference

801
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:26,360
Sweet mother sweet mother send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear

802
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,000
It is the sacrament done to summon the night mother satans

803
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,200
Uh, that was her reference for the banner. Okay up next

804
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,200
Azura or should I say stacey milkerton?

805
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,440
Uh, here we go. Boom. Okay. So that was her name hearty hearty heart. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm bad at naming

806
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,040
So this was her banner concept that ended up becoming her loading screen

807
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,320
This is our banner concept. It didn't get finished, but this is now her new loading

808
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,120
Fondle of bosom

809
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,840
So

810
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,480
Development on azura was so simple

811
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,400
It was easy peasy lemon sco easy

812
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,560
We had thick goddess straight from the bat. We knew we wanted her thick. We had horns

813
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,720
Uh concept art said fantastic because this is what we got next

814
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:31,000
Boom, she's already there. You know what's different, but look at this azura azura was nailed off the bat the most simplest

815
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,480
easiest

816
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,960
Design honestly, so as you can see she's pretty much there. So as we progress right something's not right with the legs, right?

817
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:46,280
Okay, boom. We've now got stirrup thigh highs. You are welcome

818
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,480
chocolate stirrup thigh high

819
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Words and stuff

820
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,040
Okay, right. Right. Right. What's what's missing? Hold on. What's missing?

821
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,760
Something's not quite finished with her

822
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:08,600
Markings. Yes, that makes sense. She's a goddess add them markings. So nose arm thigh add them markings. Okay. Okay. We're cooking

823
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
We're cooking

824
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,520
We're cooking

825
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,360
And then oh, what was that? Did you see that? Did you see that change on the thigh? Boom

826
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,520
Little little thigh things going on beautiful beautiful gorgeous

827
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
And then next next next what's next?

828
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,920
Uh, I think that's actually an older one there and I was just thinking that and then boom

829
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,240
She got her toe rings added. Let's go toe rings

830
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,720
And now we have azura there we go

831
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,240
I was going to be a milk god

832
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,280
Nate it should very should very simplistic very easy very quick

833
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,160
Uh, right

834
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,880
Please hold on to your hats

835
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
Because I present to you

836
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,240
AC

837
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,560
No, not that

838
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,720
That's that's ac

839
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,880
Uh

840
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,880
Yeah, that was ac

841
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,440
um

842
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Enjoy

843
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,560
Okay

844
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,440
AC was conceptualized to be an insomniatic gamer. Okay

845
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,960
We kept the insomniatic vibes because if you didn't know polar bears do not hibernate

846
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,680
Unless they're pregnant. So

847
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,480
If see y'all better you better jump off my daughter right now. Okay

848
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,440
She she doesn't need to hibernate

849
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:47,560
However, please I would like to draw your attention to the paws. See those neon blue paws. They were supposed to follow her around

850
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,520
Polar bear paws

851
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:56,360
Oh, okay. So we took it from there. We took it from there. Yeah, that's actually that's where we started

852
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,600
And then we got the polar bear paws added in these antenna things and it just

853
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,040
Was me looking me was me was me congealing and then look at that

854
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,840
Look at the pillow the belly button. Please analyze the belly button for me because there's a lot of polar bear

855
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
piercing on her stomach

856
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,200
Uh, yeah, originally she was to have a wee person and uh

857
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:25,800
Both the concept artist and I were like look it's not working out. We're gonna need to be we're gonna need

858
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,120
We're gonna need you to cook so whoa

859
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,080
We're changing it up. So acie

860
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,760
Had little little braids little tribal braids and she's freaking adorable

861
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,840
And the top of her shirt's all ripped up. But she has like big baggy sleeves

862
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,040
Getting very cute. It does look a bit sleep whereas, but she had a little piercing as well here a little tummy pierce

863
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,720
Um, we're getting a bit closer to acie. We know today

864
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,720
Hmm

865
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,960
And then okay, we got another design. We've taken away the long sleeve. So

866
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,560
We're not quite there yet. We're not quite there yet. Hold on. Hold on. Okay, okay

867
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,480
We're getting a bit more primal now. Look at the gloves gloves glove check glove check. Okay. Gloves are on check

868
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,760
Well, they wear gloves at the start but then they became paws

869
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:18,920
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So we had a little comparison and then whoa, hold on hold on

870
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,400
We have paws established. We have an ace

871
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,280
tight design established

872
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,080
very bare-esk

873
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,360
And then

874
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,880
Yeah, we we got we got there. So she has her insomniatic eyes on she has a toggle for insomniatic eyes

875
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,720
But she's insomniatic but take a little look at her feet. They're so different

876
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,680
She had open toe boots

877
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,680
She had her little toes out

878
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,640
But you can see she definitely has claws at this part of development

879
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,520
But she has scars all over her ripped clothing that kind of thing

880
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:58,360
Um, and if you really want to zoom in she actually has a tiny tiny cleavage line because she has a little something there

881
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,920
Uh, emi is true petam

882
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,240
But acie uh has just uh just a little hint of something, you know

883
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,800
Uh, oh, uh, this shouldn't be in the middle of it

884
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,440
But this was her banner concept because she's a little insomniac

885
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,040
Okay, she's a little insomniac. She's so tired

886
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,520
She's up at 3am. So this was her banner, but it didn't get finished

887
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,840
Due to time constraints, absolutely no fault of papaparito at all. He was fantastic. That's a very adorable banner

888
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,120
Um, yeah, as I said the name concepts and then this was her first model

889
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:38,200
Uh, draft not model. Sorry like the the the the draft of the model

890
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,720
And we were like, oh, was it no that what that was the first draft and we're like

891
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:52,360
Get those thighs thicker and squish her please and then we squished her down got nice and squished

892
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,400
Um, and then there's acie

893
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,400
Uh, uh, yeah, there she is

894
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,680
That's acie cool. Uh, she was definitely a bit more difficult in development just because we

895
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:12,840
I gave the wrong prompts to the concept artist. So that's on me. So she took a wee bit longer to get there

896
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,360
Uh for mercy

897
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,320
Uh, please remember her code name was karam. I may accidentally refer to her as karam

898
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,640
I've called her karam for an entire year. Please understand. Please forgive. Okay

899
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,920
Uh, this was a banner that was supposed to be

900
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,200
for mercy

901
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:37,000
Um, it was going to be darkened out and shadowed a lot more but obviously there was a bit insidiousness

902
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,720
and in background and

903
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,400
Uh going on but yes, so originally

904
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,400
I originally mercy had twin tails

905
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,560
or drills

906
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,880
Kind of looking thing going on

907
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:02,360
Um, but she always had her bow her stomach wasn't showing actually just her mid drift. I believe it's a terminology for that

908
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,480
Um, I stole her wig honestly

909
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:13,720
Um, but yeah, uh, we definitely were really close to mercy right from the start, but she was blonde

910
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,400
Well, would it well a blonde? I know

911
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:25,320
Um, and then we showed her stomach and it was like, okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

912
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:31,560
And then we got blonde and alterations in comparison

913
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,560
But now obviously you've seen that purple

914
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,480
So she's purple. You know what I'm saying out here is purple

915
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,160
Uh, but now that I see blonde mercy

916
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,640
It does not like it looks wrong to me because it's like that's not how it should be looking

917
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,280
Um, and then we got purple eyes

918
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,080
Here we're the purple beam right now

919
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:03,080
And then boom we got her mercy starts. I've not called her karambi accident in so long

920
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,240
Uh

921
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:10,600
But yeah, there you go. Uh, she was relatively there. She was there from the start. Honestly, uh, not too much of a

922
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,640
Issue, you know, you can see the comparison. Um

923
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,800
She be

924
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,240
She be I'm sorry to expose you like this

925
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,520
This is the first sign of she be

926
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:33,480
I'm sorry. Okay. We thought of a rabbit with her ears up. Okay. We're sorry. I'm sorry. Okay

927
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, so

928
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,600
You were supposed to have mercy. No, not fondle of booze. I'm the she be cotton boom

929
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:52,920
Okay, we didn't go with the design before anyone said we didn't go with the design relax

930
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,640
Who said FNAF Bonnie?

931
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,840
That's awful

932
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:04,680
Don't speak for the rest of the stream. We didn't go for the design. So

933
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,720
Um, Azura was already established to be purple at this point. So

934
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,080
We were changing the body tape and then the body tape got changed

935
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:22,600
So she became like the stereotypical milk body type of the boobanda hips

936
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,520
Um, and then but we're still purple and we were having

937
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,760
I'll be honest. This was getting really frustration frustration. Lovely. This is getting really

938
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:39,960
Frustrating at this point in development. She be we had been cooking for a bit and we were really struggling like but then

939
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,560
We had I don't think these are in order

940
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,600
No, they're not. Oh well. Hey, ho

941
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,960
So

942
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,880
We were having color palette issues. I like the outfit. I liked everything about it

943
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,840
But the hair the color palette was just not working

944
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:02,680
So I went to a concept artist to very quickly give me a different pose and we went with two hairstyles. Let's say give me this hairstyle

945
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,200
Uh, she looks like a fucking giraffe. So, no, we didn't go with a body ponytail

946
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,280
She looks like some sort of horse a chivalre

947
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,000
Like unparred like I didn't want a horse vtuber if you want a horse vtuber

948
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,920
We ain't the agency for you because I'm not interested in horse girls

949
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:25,080
Okay, but we got the drills and if you didn't know shebe's drills actually get more red at the bottom

950
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,960
It's a very small detail very small detail

951
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:34,600
Come ride this pony. Honestly. Oh, that's why you've got a riding crop. You're a secret horse vtuber all along shebe

952
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,600
I can't believe I've got you in 4k

953
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,160
but yeah, um

954
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,240
as you can see the

955
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,880
Little bit gear. Um, it was always a part like the anklet the

956
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,000
Hand cuffs were always going to be a part of her design

957
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:56,280
And then we got our first model back and we were like, uh, excuse me. Where's the thickness?

958
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:03,080
Like give us something like this and then you know came along and then hey, oh, it's so easy

959
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,120
It's not the main focus

960
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,120
Not the main focus

961
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,680
Okay, this was her banner concept

962
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,440
Uh, again banner concept my legs are long

963
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:21,080
These are your banner concepts, but uh, unfortunately didn't make it to finalize production, but this was to be the banner

964
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,840
It's probably a bit too much now that i'm looking at it a bit a bit too a bit too

965
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,480
Spacey a bit too spacey for you

966
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,040
I see it

967
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,560
right

968
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,560
my tone

969
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,720
womp womp

970
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,520
Womp womp there's straw name

971
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:49,640
There we are. That's me at the start of development. Do you like it? What do you think?

972
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,240
Is it good? Is it peak quick?

973
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,880
I'm going to very quickly go get a cool look as my voice is dying. Give me one second

974
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,840
I know streamers are supposed to be open. Oh, I don't know if you heard me

975
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:19,640
I don't need to point in mutant because i'm literally going in the kitchen now i'm back in the room and the truck is working again

976
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,640
I stubbed my toe when I left the room that actually really hurt

977
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,200
okay

978
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,720
So yeah, uh

979
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,560
My development was different because I was allowed to dictate my design. Okay, so we started with hypnosis

980
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:40,040
And then I was a little splatoon squiddle fish ms paint looking ass. You don't watch that. You're done. You're done

981
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,600
Okay, so I was a squiddle

982
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:49,160
And then so this design don't write this design off. I want to develop this further. I love the color scheme

983
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,640
I love the bikini type thing going on

984
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,480
um the only thing that kill oh wait, I need to open my cola

985
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,680
the only thing like

986
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:04,840
I think this might be an all outfit all hairstyle because I love those like cat ear looking things on me

987
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,360
And I had my little shell on my hair at this point Zelda looking ass

988
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,680
No, don't insult it. I think it's really good. I really like this design

989
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,760
I like the color scheme with the browns and the

990
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,320
Kind of black thing going on. It's good. It's good. You know, let me cook. Let me cook

991
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,920
so

992
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,640
I originally wasn't gonna have any booba basically because um

993
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:35,720
But then that got changed because I technically have five children with emmy and isi and azura

994
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,760
And mersey and sheevee. So I originally didn't have any chest size

995
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,880
But then we retconned that because technically uh, yeah, uh very big on the dumpy

996
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,880
So I had clocks for hypnosis to hang off. I always had hypnosis from the star and then

997
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,560
Changed the color a bit, but then I look like an xbox

998
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,520
And then

999
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,520
it's

1000
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:07,400
But that wasn't this shouldn't be here. We're still a bit too early because uh

1001
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,600
There's one more design that we didn't finish off. This is Celtic me

1002
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:18,600
um, I definitely am getting an alternative outfit of Celtic me because

1003
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,040
I know it might be hard to tell with the accent and all but I'm just a wee bit scottish

1004
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:30,280
But I try and annunciate and make sure you guys can understand me. So yeah, I don't talk the way like

1005
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,200
I'm an accent, but I'm definitely getting this developed further the hair. Uh, I like big hair

1006
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:41,320
So I'm probably not gonna keep that hairstyle going on, but I had like a little ears going on little squiddled ears

1007
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,040
Um, but that got developed a bit more this honestly looks kind of a bit

1008
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,280
Renny's Renny thorns, but if you look at that, this is like very Celtic origin and like little symbolism and that that

1009
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,880
Definitely gonna develop this because uh, it's good, but it wasn't what I wanted the

1010
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,360
The default to be the default that's the word. Um

1011
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:11,640
Yeah, I got a thingy my hair probably changed that. Oh, I got that foreign to the Celtic design. Oh my god. I completely forgot

1012
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,440
Well, there's my Celtic. There's my next outfit boys. Uh

1013
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,080
But yeah, very very squiddled very Celtic here. Um

1014
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,840
Yeah, uh

1015
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,840
Yes, um

1016
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:34,760
I was presented with my squiddled eyes here and I actually have a bikini toggle

1017
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,520
Obviously, I'm not gonna do it right now because now's not the time for it

1018
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,880
But I have a pair less and I have tape over me, but you see like I technically have tape over my

1019
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,880
Bits, you know bits if I go back a few

1020
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:56,120
Um, yeah, I did I really like this Celtic warrior one because I can just I'll just talk about the battle of bannock burn all the time

1021
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,080
Why not? But yeah, you can definitely see me starting to come to life here

1022
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:07,880
Uh, like the shell of my hair. I did have two bunches, but they weren't as big like I have really big bunches

1023
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,840
um

1024
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:17,720
Got like and then my eyes so my default eyes were going to be swirls, but then I got my squiddled eyes

1025
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,560
Because I'm a cuttlefish. I'm a cephalopod

1026
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,800
Yeah, and then I finally came to there's me

1027
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,480
Ta-da

1028
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,480
It's a me

1029
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:38,920
Uh, and then of course finished models, okay, I'll tell you some hidden things

1030
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:46,040
I'm going to tell you some hidden things now. This is this is what agencies kind of have to deal with behind the scenes

1031
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:53,080
Azura was conceptualized black. Okay a chocolate to be tuber if you will, okay

1032
01:00:54,280 --> 01:01:01,000
However, I came to the horrible realization. I can't put a white girl on Azura

1033
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:10,120
Oh my fucking god. So Azura in development was made racially ambiguous. Now, I apologize for such terminology

1034
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,920
But that's just how it is. That's how the facts are

1035
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:19,560
So she was made racially ambiguous if you look back in some of the promotional models and artwork

1036
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:27,400
She'll notice how pale she was. That's because we had to make her ambiguous. Okay, then Azura came aboard and I was like

1037
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,120
Choclifier right now

1038
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,280
Like get on it

1039
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,840
So, yes, her finalized looks the zoom in a little bit on the finalized model

1040
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,280
Just to highlight a few things that are going on with her beautiful design. So if you didn't know very quickly

1041
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:50,920
Azura's your mummy quite literally lower wise. She's your mama. She is the goddess of fertility on planet earth

1042
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:56,440
You heard that right, but she didn't want to go to the heavens with her family

1043
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,920
She wanted to stay among the humans

1044
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:04,440
So she has retained some of her powers as a god

1045
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,480
Okay

1046
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,800
So she has the power of flight, believe it or not. So she's gonna fly on my deck

1047
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,000
Um, I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. Uh

1048
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,640
She also has healing properties

1049
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,600
with her

1050
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,080
milk

1051
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:28,120
Um, yeah, uh, she can also be a giantess as tall as a skyscraper

1052
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:35,000
These markings are made from when she founded civilization. She has painted nails painted toes

1053
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,480
She has toe rings on her index toes

1054
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,080
a little veil over her thigh highs

1055
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:49,960
Vail in the head or just hips for days like definitely kind of the the birthing hips because she birthed humanity

1056
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,680
like that's the kind of thing going on so

1057
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,320
Yeah

1058
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:00,440
Definitely her design was absolutely gorgeous. Um, we had quite a lot of issues

1059
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,680
I ordered the girls quite a few fan arts once we had the designs finalized

1060
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,560
There was a lot of issues with artists not understanding the white

1061
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:16,280
Is her goat ears and they were drawing her like the star wars characters. You know those characters that have the

1062
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,720
Like the thing on the front of them

1063
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:24,120
We got a lot of artwork of that and I had to send back and be like, no, she's a goat

1064
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,200
to go

1065
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,520
Uh go a not door like that. Thanks

1066
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:35,960
Um, ace of cool. She's got scars, which is a very unique element to her. She also has a mouth

1067
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:42,040
Fang not a tooth fang a mouth fang. Okay, mouth fang

1068
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,320
She has scars

1069
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:48,280
Um, she has ripped clothing

1070
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,280
Um, she also has

1071
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,920
Steel toad capped boots. So, you know, she's safe for work

1072
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,080
100% safe for work character. She got them steel toad boots on. Okay

1073
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,720
um

1074
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:06,920
What other attributes she has a tail? Oh, yeah, uh, zura has a tail and I say has a tail. Um

1075
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,560
May oh look at me

1076
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:16,840
Uh, so, uh, if you didn't know I am wearing a yukata as a nod to japanese culture because

1077
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:22,840
Without japanese culture truly as v-tubers, we would not be here right now. Let's not pretend otherwise. Oh

1078
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,080
I forgot my cover up over my crotch. I am so sorry

1079
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,640
I forgot about that part of my design

1080
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,360
Uh, I literally have

1081
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:45,320
I flushed your twigs. I'm so sorry. I was supposed to have the bandaid on

1082
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:52,600
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But anyway, I'm in a yukata. Uh, it's pearlescent

1083
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:58,200
So it shimmers as I move my uh shells in my head also are pearlescent and I'm so sorry

1084
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,680
I'm gonna just take a little drink of my cola

1085
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,960
Oops, uh, but yes, I'm in a yukata as a nod to japanese culture. Um

1086
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,840
For my next alternative, I almost likely do a scottish Celtic type origin

1087
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,560
Uh, we can see it. Um

1088
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,680
Uh, squid eyes. Yep. I am a cuttlefish. I have cuttlefish eyeballs

1089
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:30,760
When we released the eye previews people were surprised but for me if v-tubers just have a regular pupil

1090
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,360
I sleep. I'm sorry

1091
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:40,840
But it's like one of the most simplistic things you can design if you give someone a basic pupil as a vtuber

1092
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,160
Eh boring out

1093
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,280
I'm sorry. That's just my opinion

1094
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:53,800
It was one of the first notes that I gave to the concept artists do not give me a regular pupil

1095
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:59,560
I will perish again same with like fingernail designs, etc. I have french tip

1096
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:07,240
Manicure pedicure the girls all have painted nails. Merci also has band aids on her fingers, for example

1097
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,840
um

1098
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,960
These small things like add up definitely. Um

1099
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,320
Yeah, like I this is just my opinion, but I think the

1100
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:23,320
There's nothing to if a design gets too complex on a vtuber

1101
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,280
This is just my opinion as well. My opinion just don't do not fucking represent the company as a whole

1102
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,280
It's just me being

1103
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,680
But um

1104
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,160
Like if the designs get too complicated, like I don't know

1105
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,440
I can't remember what the fucking things call but like, you know, there's japanese

1106
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:44,360
Idol skirts where there's like three different meshes and layers and designs and patterns going on

1107
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,480
I'm like, if you start getting too thingy, you're getting nay fan art

1108
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:53,080
No one's going to recognize you because you're xyz like i'm sorry, but you cannae tell me that our designs look

1109
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:58,600
Anything remotely similar to clutter. That's the word cluttered if the designs are too cluttered

1110
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:04,120
Uh, please think of the fan art literally like I'd say mercy is the most

1111
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,680
She doesn't have a cover up. We'll enjoy mercy from here

1112
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:18,040
Uh, mercy is probably the most complex design we have if you want to think of it as layers in terms of fishnet and bandages and

1113
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,200
All that jazz, yeah

1114
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,840
Got strike the balance between not being too over complicated that okay, finally one model that control the full design of

1115
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,840
uh

1116
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:36,120
So if you didn't know she be her hair drills get redder the more bottom you go

1117
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:41,000
That's not even a full english sentence. Um, if you didn't

1118
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,800
No, her thighs got chunked up in development

1119
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:53,560
Uh, we went for the classic leg look look some things are classic and you there's no point

1120
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,840
Don't if it ain't broke don't fix it high heels

1121
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,680
and

1122
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,880
stockings

1123
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,960
If it ain't broke

1124
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:07,560
Don't fix it. You don't need to do anything special anything unique

1125
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:14,200
Any of that stuff. It's not broke. It's the perfect design. I don't don't even talk to me. Okay

1126
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,320
um, so obviously

1127
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,400
My voice is going

1128
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,720
Hold on. Let me take another drink. Um

1129
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,720
Um

1130
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:33,400
I do apologize and say that uh azura and she be you're actually gonna get an update soon to cover up their tattoos. Um

1131
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,360
Because I think youtube are not very happy

1132
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,240
I tried to run ads on them and youtube said no, no, no, no, and I was like

1133
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:46,920
But I have my boobs out as well youtube. So this is just discrimination against big titty girls

1134
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,800
um

1135
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,320
I don't know what else is she be designed was just perfect. Honestly

1136
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:03,880
A lot of people are like, hey, wait a second. Why is she wearing the bbsm gear if she's supposed to be the dominant one?

1137
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
called like I don't know

1138
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,640
Is my response to that like

1139
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,320
Like

1140
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,080
going just

1141
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,440
Going just like

1142
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:24,760
Enjoy the design. Are you joking me? You look at this design and that and you complain about it

1143
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,680
I'm not a guy. Okay. I didn't have a willy, but if I had a willy, I know for a fact

1144
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,400
This is a 10 out of 10 design. Okay. It's aesthetics

1145
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,040
aesthetic

1146
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,200
Like that's it

1147
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:43,480
Like like you're done. Didn't he didn't he chat shit about me about these designs?

1148
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,600
Amy, I'm sorry. I had to get you asleep when I was doing this one

1149
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,240
Because I lost your full picture

1150
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,320
somehow

1151
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,320
Amy is adorable

1152
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,560
love her design

1153
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:02,920
She has a rat skull on her necklace and these little gemstones too. She has nails on her thingy

1154
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:07,480
she's only of a only one in v allure that has a

1155
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,200
Tatoo

1156
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:14,360
Is it a tattoo or is it a marking because she did something funny with a book?

1157
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,640
Who knows I didn't really develop that part of the lore. So

1158
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,200
You guys can pick it's up to you

1159
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:27,080
A womb tat it lights up. No, it doesn't let it's not with tattoo. Don't you loot my daughter

1160
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:33,640
She also has adorable band-aid and freckles on her knee nose and on her weenie. She got a knee bump. No

1161
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:39,800
No, let me make it better. Oh, wait. Oh wait, you're layered above me. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. I need to make it better

1162
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,880
I'll need to kiss her knee better

1163
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,040
Hold on. Let me cook

1164
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Oh, no

1165
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,040
Oh, my hair's too big right. I need a bald toggle right now

1166
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, it's all better

1167
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,280
She also has a knife and blood on her sock if you didn't know that was knife and blood on her sock. Yes, um

1168
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,160
look

1169
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:09,080
In terms of like sacrifice and people and stuff it means like a little quirky like that

1170
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:14,040
Okay, like whatever she needs to do to get back and you know get her brother back

1171
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:21,720
And for the papegas out there you viewing are her brother watching her from afar. Okay

1172
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,880
For the papegas. Don't worry. I'm papega too. So right. Where are we?

1173
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,080
Is that everything? No

1174
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,480
Let's go

1175
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:37,400
All the girls descriptions for their newest 2.0's will have merch updates if you didn't know

1176
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,400
All of the

1177
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,800
prophets

1178
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:50,040
Go to the girls veiler. Do not take a cut of the merchandise. We don't put our little fingies in the merchandise

1179
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,400
So rest assured if you buy something off uwu market for my buy

1180
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:03,080
All that money goes to support in them a lot of the girls are interested in moving out so they can up their streaming time

1181
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:07,160
They are trying very hard. I'm trying to support them in any way I possibly can

1182
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,160
and

1183
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,840
Hopefully from what you've seen not even to cover the cost. So

1184
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,560
uwu market

1185
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:21,160
Will take their cut or whatever their you know earning is and then whatever is left over is profit-wise

1186
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:26,040
Goes straight to the talent. It does not go into vealers like accounts or anything like that

1187
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:33,240
So please seriously rest assured like this isn't some sort of money grab agency when you support your talent

1188
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:39,000
You support your talent like the talent. Okay. You don't have to think to yourself

1189
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:44,120
Oh, if I give a hundred dollars, are they gonna get seven dollars of it? No

1190
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,720
That's not how it works here. It's not called

1191
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:52,440
Guys don't even take two percent. No the hundred percent march to the girls

1192
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,680
like come on

1193
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,960
What wouldn't you be like in your head?

1194
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,280
Wouldn't you be upset if you learned like oh, I supported

1195
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:08,680
The my oh shi desu with a hundred dollars and they only made like five bucks because of how much the yoink like

1196
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,480
You know what I'm saying? So

1197
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:15,800
I'm just coming out and saying it 80 20 cut and guess what if the girls stay on another year

1198
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:21,480
It goes to a 15 cut for veal or because the girls do all the work. Actually, that's a really good point

1199
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,560
I might talk about that

1200
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:31,080
Um, oh, this is like oh, oh, I need to do my merch. Hold on. I uh, it's a strong image tentacles tentacle power

1201
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,000
tentacle power

1202
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,120
Um, I am actually gonna get a keychain because I'm so excited. I'm getting all the girls keychains

1203
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,760
No, I'm gonna say something

1204
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,720
And I might filter a few people

1205
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,800
I'm okay with hand cam streams

1206
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,760
I'm gonna make an ASMR video of me like tapping on all the keychains of the girls

1207
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,760
I'm gonna like melise them with my hands

1208
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:59,400
Um, so, you know if you are into the vtuber immersion where you don't see any body parts

1209
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:05,240
I'm very sorry. I'm not the vtuber for you, but there's definitely veal the lure girl out there for you. Just not me

1210
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,080
Yeah, I'll be I'm gonna touch all the girls. Okay

1211
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:14,440
Yeah, just my keychain. I really like that. This came out so good. I really like it

1212
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,200
Um, okay, I think we can do the Q&A

1213
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,640
section now

1214
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:30,200
Uh, I am going to link my marshmallow if anyone would like to ask a question in private because I do understand some people

1215
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,520
are a bit adverse

1216
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,520
Are a bit embarrassed

1217
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,360
Uh, so ask any agency related questions here

1218
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,960
agent sign

1219
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,160
that's

1220
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,160
Did that even send? Oh

1221
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:49,080
Oh and my toggles are all coming on because I forgot to unbind them from my keyboard. You know what?

1222
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,920
You know what? If it wasn't a scoff, you wouldn't be enjoying yourself. I will take

1223
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,960
me out of this. Oh my god. I can hear myself twice.

1224
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,160
Right, let me pin that message

1225
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,960
Right, let's see

1226
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:06,520
What are the plans for membership streams versus patreon? Let me take my toggle off first

1227
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:12,680
Um, so if you want to support the girl on patreon, you will get access to four audios. I would like to comment on that

1228
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,720
Um, obviously I had to do a lot of preparing in advance

1229
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:23,640
It's five dollars to support your girl on patreon for four audios

1230
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,840
What we are doing is called undercutting the market

1231
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:33,000
If you didn't know undercutting the market means you put your product quotation marks out

1232
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,720
At a rate that is incredibly cheap in comparison to other va's

1233
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,440
Not only do you get streams from the girls

1234
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,040
Not only do you get alternative content on their all twitter's for free

1235
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,000
But we have undercut the market on patreon as well

1236
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:51,560
So if you would like to test the content that they produce

1237
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,800
on patreon

1238
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,480
I highly recommend

1239
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,480
Supporting them

1240
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:04,200
Over me because I post free stuff all the time. You don't all worry about me. Okay, so support that girl's first

1241
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:09,160
It's called undercutting the market isn't a very nice thing to do, but it's uh

1242
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:18,520
It is what it is now. I did have a few concerns about the type of audios. Please understand and direct any

1243
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,640
Disappointments towards me

1244
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:28,440
Because um, I did not the girls have shown interest some of them to create the scripts and role plays

1245
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:34,040
But please understand. I had to make sure I'm not putting them in a position where they are

1246
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,760
overstressed or overworked

1247
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,440
when it comes to balancing streaming and

1248
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:50,280
The role plays now I have made them as straightforward and the girls are welcome to talk about their experience on stream

1249
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,560
Behind the scenes, you know as long as not an nda hens

1250
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:59,400
I'm sure they know the difference between like leaking nda content and just being like oh, this is how it works. Okay

1251
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:08,120
Well, let's say five dollars forever. Yes. Um, I uh believe um

1252
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:14,120
I have no plans to raise the price. I think five dollars. Um

1253
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,440
is

1254
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:23,480
An acceptable price. I'm I'm very aware of the economy the state that the bloody hangs in

1255
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:24,600
Um

1256
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:30,360
And in order to support your oh shi desks that might be in veiler the maximum price you will pay per month

1257
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,040
I believe is nine dollars and ninety nine cent us dollars

1258
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:40,360
For the maximum price of uh, again all content that your oh shi desks produces. Okay

1259
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,600
So

1260
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:48,680
I wanted it to be as affordable as possible and again that 80 20 split goes across the board your

1261
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:53,720
Majority is supporting your talent. It's not getting hogged up to the agency. Okay?

1262
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,720
Um

1263
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:03,000
What will the main content on the youtube channels be streaming? We are v-tubers. We're just regular v-tubers that offer the goods on the side

1264
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:10,280
But um, please do not think we are trying to speed run banning our youtube channels

1265
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,960
Um, there was a few misconceptions out there that we may

1266
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:20,040
Do outrageous things. Please understand. Uh, I'm trying to help these girls become

1267
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:25,000
content creators of their dreams help them achieve things that they've always wanted to do

1268
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,640
Hell even get them a play button

1269
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,720
So as much as jorkin der pintis

1270
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:38,600
On youtube would be hilarious content for three seconds. I really don't want them to get banned. So

1271
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:44,040
They're just gonna be my lovely v-tribbon gals. Um

1272
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,320
Yes

1273
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:53,240
We need you on stage at a v-tribbon convention. This is insane market and i'm praying insane market

1274
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:58,600
What revealing that azur's codename with stacey milker in is insane market

1275
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,960
No, absolutely no

1276
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,080
Absolutely no

1277
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:16,520
Awesome. Oh, yeah, be sucky by the way instead of veal or be sucky. Oh, you've oh, I've got you right there

1278
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,400
Nah, I'm talking the behind. Okay. The behind the scenes stuff is all fun to kind of be like

1279
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:28,040
So obviously you've just met the girls. I have known them for a year if that makes sense

1280
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,840
Like these concepts and everything's been going on for a year. I want some v sucky

1281
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:39,160
Hey, the behind the scenes content was cringe cringe, but peak. Thank you fondle a bosom

1282
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,640
Um

1283
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:50,280
Can't wait to see be sucky at off guy. Oh, we got all right. No, it's not okay before before I say the story

1284
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,440
We got uninvited to a convention

1285
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,720
So the girl we got invited to a convention. Uh, we were getting a free pass

1286
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:03,080
And then the girls not safe for work twitters went live and then nine hours later

1287
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:08,600
We got an email saying oops our convention is full. Uh, we're not interested anymore

1288
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,400
But nine hours prior they were like, yeah, we're still interested. Uh, we can set up a booth

1289
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,640
We can give you free pass to staff members

1290
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:20,520
And we got uninvited when the girls not safe for work twitters went live

1291
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,760
Oh

1292
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:28,120
So, yeah, we're kind of spend on that but whatever convention

1293
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,960
I do have good news that we are going to a convention

1294
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:38,440
In 2025, um, it will be remote. I don't think uh, I can physically show up

1295
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,720
I don't think any of us can for safety or whatever. Although I don't want to

1296
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:47,320
That's the stream for me. I'll I'll talk about the idea in the stream. Sorry. My voice is getting fried right now. Can you hear it?

1297
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,960
Oh

1298
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,720
Um, no, so the the bizarre thing was on our website

1299
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,600
We said from the start we're a bit naughty naughty

1300
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:02,520
And then the email does on the website like we'd love all your talents to come to our agency to our agency to our convention

1301
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,360
I was like, hey, yeah

1302
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:09,320
And then we really and then we do the thing that we said we were going to do on the website and they were like, oh, sorry

1303
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,320
We're fully booked me. I'm like

1304
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,000
Okay

1305
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,960
Yeah, yeah, that's some fun behind the scenes. I oh don't know the watch alongs

1306
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:24,840
Oh my god, if you are a vtuber that has a management that deals with sponsorships

1307
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,920
You got cucked out of so much money

1308
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,280
So

1309
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,920
Oh my god, thank you to everyone who accepted the watch alongs. I'm gonna burp

1310
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,640
I am so

1311
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:45,960
We offer 12,000 us dollars for a three hour react and a watch along

1312
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,040
Got told nah

1313
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:52,840
They were like nah, we don't want to we don't want to put your audio and video on screen

1314
01:21:53,400 --> 01:22:00,600
Denied 7,000 us dollar offer no response 6,000 us dollar offer no response

1315
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:08,120
3,000 multiple 3,000 us dollars to sit and react for three hours to cute girls debut and

1316
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:13,640
No response. So for those of you who did do the watch alongs

1317
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:19,160
Thank you from the bottom of my heart because one you weren't greedy shits

1318
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,200
And two you actually gave us the time of day. I'm very thankful

1319
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,920
so, yeah

1320
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:35,080
Yeah, vnu thumbs up yumi plus thumbs up a lot of vtuber agencies didn't even respond to emails thumbs down

1321
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,680
Like not even a courtesy email

1322
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,760
There's a lot of theories about why we didn't get a response

1323
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:48,200
But uh, I completely get it. I'm just freaking meman by the way before you're like, oh my god

1324
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,000
I hate vtuber agencies. No, it's not how it works

1325
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:57,480
um, but um off kai clashed with a lot of things I think I offered like 10,000

1326
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,840
Oh, that was it. I think I offered a 8,000 to someone and never got response

1327
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:08,760
But uh, I'm telling you right now if you have a manager that is a barrier between someone saying to you

1328
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:13,240
Hey, I want to sponsor you. Yeah, you got wrecked because there was I think

1329
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,280
We sent 40 managements

1330
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,440
emails out with the offer inside

1331
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,080
and

1332
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,760
like no response

1333
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:31,720
Crickets and the fact that the 12k one was hilarious because the original offer was 10k

1334
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,440
and then they were like

1335
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:40,840
Actually this feature were just 4,000 per hour. So I was like right fine raise our offer to 12k

1336
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:46,680
And then we told her like little thing. We're like, yeah, just react to the girls have a audio and and they were like

1337
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:52,600
We actually recommend not having the video and audio on so more people go into the streams

1338
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,280
I was like

1339
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,000
Mate, we're paying you 12,000 us dollars

1340
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:04,360
And you're you're not gonna do like what we kindly ask which is be a react Andy Andy for three hours like it was

1341
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:11,720
I was crazy. I cannot tell you what goes on behind the scenes. Absolutely crazy crazy crazy

1342
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:19,400
But anyway, sorry, I was taking a drink of cola when oh all our models have a sleep. Are you ready for my sleep?

1343
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,040
I do hypnosis when I sleep

1344
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:33,720
Uh, would you kindly be a react and do yeah, so anyway thumbs up to everyone who did end up doing a watch long

1345
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,200
I apologize to anyone

1346
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,640
um

1347
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,360
Who submitted themselves and your price was too high

1348
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,440
I didn't even

1349
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:47,240
Bother to haggle if your price was too high because I was like mate some

1350
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:54,680
Um, I don't want to be mean but some of you had very interesting price points

1351
01:24:55,400 --> 01:25:01,880
Someone was like what's your average viewership 20 views and they asked for uh

1352
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:09,320
I think it was 700 us dollars and I'm like that's that's not how it works. But thank you for your submitting yourself

1353
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,200
I appreciate it

1354
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:20,120
Uh, but yeah, and also I am so sorry if you applied uh under the veal or googled thingy

1355
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:24,200
And you said you would be you would do it for free anyway

1356
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,600
I'm sorry, but I didn't reply because you said you'd do it for free

1357
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,080
So

1358
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,080
to apologize

1359
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,920
um

1360
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,680
Oh my god, are you ever going to do a generation of guys?

1361
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,600
Uh, no smile. This is a whammy agency. Um, I apologize

1362
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:53,560
We don't do that here. Um, no, I'm absolutely nothing against male v-tubers and stuff

1363
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,520
But the only reason you know strongy can

1364
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,400
Stronetize is because strongy

1365
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,360
strongy has

1366
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,680
knowledge and experience and stuff

1367
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:12,200
So I will apply it to the girls and yeah, but I'm not a guy as much as I would like to have a weenus

1368
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,280
I'm not a guy

1369
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,200
So I can't help guys

1370
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,040
Can't help guys succeed

1371
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,000
Sorry

1372
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
However, I can appeal to guys

1373
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:26,280
You know, but some things I say with a broken voice like yeah, I'm sure you like this voice on you

1374
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,280
And

1375
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,080
strongy max and honestly hold on take another drink

1376
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,640
I've got a 2.0 to thinking

1377
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,320
As well

1378
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:45,400
I think what we'll do is I'm gonna redirect into sheebie

1379
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,960
And then I'll pull up my uh my 2.0 where I'm just yapping about myself

1380
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:56,120
Uh, right. I'm go any more questions that I can right stop typing fondle of booze up, right?

1381
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,280
And now if I'm trying to look for questions

1382
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,920
um

1383
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:05,000
When can I buy a sheebie boob on mouse pad?

1384
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:13,960
So the girl's birthdays are when they're going to do donathons and um, I actually might do an open stream

1385
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,960
Where we can all discuss it together

1386
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:21,000
Azura is the first donathon. Don't worry Azura if you're watching. I'm gonna help you through it

1387
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,960
She doesn't really know what she's doing, but I'll help her. Um, I'm going to focus on

1388
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,920
public rewards

1389
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,240
I'm gonna burp again

1390
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,640
Oh my god

1391
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,840
Sorry, sorry. Sorry. I'm talking a lot

1392
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,240
um

1393
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,240
I'm going to be focusing on

1394
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,400
Jen

1395
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:48,200
The chat going not something I go through it. You see I fell off my chair

1396
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,920
Sorry

1397
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,920
um

1398
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,680
What was I saying?

1399
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:59,560
Uh, yes, we can work on donathon goals together. I will help the girls through it because uh, some are a bit unsure

1400
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,600
They've never done one before hell. I've never done a donathon before

1401
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:09,480
Definitely going to focus on public rewards at milestones and this is just me personally

1402
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:14,200
I'm absolutely not going for anyone. Don't care what the timing is but um

1403
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:22,200
Some like I've seen some donathons and the jump is like 5 000 us dollars between like the next goal

1404
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,040
And I'm like going to be serious

1405
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:29,400
Can you actually not think of one thing to do for like another 500 bucks or like another like

1406
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:33,240
One of the biggest jumps I saw I think was 20 000 us dollars

1407
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:39,240
I'm like you can't think of like one thing to do in between 20 000 us dollars like no

1408
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,120
We're not doing that here

1409
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:46,200
So I'm helping the girls to try and like pick through what to do for donathons and get rewards and all that thing

1410
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:51,640
Uh, I don't know if it was a joke or a meme because it was like pretty crazy

1411
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,160
um

1412
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:59,480
I'd miss this but how does violour make money if almost everything goes to the talent

1413
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:06,760
We got so much feedback on that. I this is terrible and I can't believe I have to say this

1414
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:11,080
But we're not an agency built on corporate greed

1415
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,720
Full stop that's the sentence

1416
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:22,680
We don't have corporate greed and the running costs of an agency after you've done the start of costs of buying the models and

1417
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,920
Getting the girls set up for stream is very low

1418
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:31,400
It does not cost a lot of money to actually tell the girls to go stream like

1419
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:39,400
It doesn't cost me any money right now to click go live and have a good time or to go away and record an ASMR video and upload it

1420
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:45,640
I know in this day and age where corporate greed is everywhere around the corner

1421
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,000
We're not an agency for corporate greed

1422
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:55,000
I hope you understand that the 80 20 split for this year the next year if the girl signs on the 15

1423
01:29:55,480 --> 01:30:03,000
Like the focus on the agency is to help the girls achieve their dreams. I know it's ambitious

1424
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:09,480
I know we're new and we're just out of the starting gate, but I hope no strong a yaw

1425
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,120
fucking burn the yaw

1426
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:19,720
No yaw for me because I don't buddy want one. I want the success of my daughters

1427
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:23,560
Go subscribe to them. Go give them a chance. Okay

1428
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:29,480
I'm not having none of this corporate greed shit in my house. Get the fuck out of here without anyway

1429
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,560
That's just my two cents

1430
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,160
But yes, um

1431
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:41,160
The reason why the company and oh and another thing and another thing. I'm gonna get started again

1432
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:48,600
Oh wait already said that they're already said that the company has been seeded the company is not in debt to banks

1433
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,680
The company is not indebted to

1434
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:58,040
The company has been seeded, which means the money was already there. It was just funneled into this one. Okay

1435
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,920
Okay

1436
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,760
Woohoo

1437
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:08,440
Oh, what about legal staff? Are you ready for this bit? We don't even have a hr department

1438
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,840
We just sexually harass each other for fun

1439
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,320
Yippie

1440
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,840
We don't have that kind of business set up

1441
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:25,720
Is there's no hr so none of the girls can report to me report me if I say anything not

1442
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:35,000
Sorry, I keep taking a drink of coal and then hypnotizing you real quick. That's true

1443
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:40,680
I'll actually everyone gets paid. That was another thing that came up actually. Um

1444
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:49,320
How this is this is actually not vtuber related. This is just human related and it's like hey, how do you get your

1445
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,400
um

1446
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:56,440
Your employees to like work and it was like, uh, actually pay them above minimum wage

1447
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,800
Like if you go to the girls and go would you rather?

1448
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,120
Ah

1449
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,440
Atchoo

1450
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,960
Okay, maybe we do slightly maybe have some sort of management. I'm fucking scared. Get out of here management

1451
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,160
I don't run the social accounts or anything like that. My gosh. My gosh. My gosh

1452
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,680
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't say anything more

1453
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:28,280
Okay, okay, I call I call most of the shots I call most of the shots

1454
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,080
Right, what was that saying? Oh, right. Yeah, if you're

1455
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:39,000
I think one of the it was like the most dumbest post was like I can't get my employees to work hard type thing

1456
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,440
And it was like, uh, yeah, because you're paying them minimum wage

1457
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,560
Maybe if you actually make them feel like valued employees

1458
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:50,040
Uh, which is where the 8020 split came in as well because I'm really sick of seeing vtuber agencies

1459
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,960
Just being really greedy and I was like, well, I'm gonna do the opposite and I get to call the shots

1460
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:58,440
So, yeah, 820 time for a black. No, not the freaking white

1461
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,160
No, the black text on the white background. Oh my god. I'm being graduated already

1462
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:08,200
Oh, it was a good run. That was a good run. See you next year when I start up the next feature break

1463
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:15,480
Uh, it's 3d content plan for we need we just go out of the gates

1464
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:21,480
You need to give the girls some some money if you want to get 3d models because uh, we spend a lot of money

1465
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:26,200
Just get into the stage. Okay. I'm gonna be honest and you put your money where your mouth is if you want to see that content

1466
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:31,720
Vsucky 2026, let's go Vsucky

1467
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,600
That's why you guys stream on youtube instead of twitch

1468
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:43,960
So twitch and youtube is like pick the lesser of two evils and from a management point of view youtube

1469
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,960
You can manage accounts on

1470
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:51,160
We regret to inform you that strongly causes me power. Oh, that's another thing. Yeah

1471
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,840
We don't have

1472
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,120
Uh, what's the word? I've already forgotten the word because we don't do it

1473
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:01,800
What is it called when management put the talent on leave like forced leave?

1474
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,240
What the heck is that word? I don't even know what that word is

1475
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:13,720
Shadowban, yeah, we don't suspension. We don't do suspensions at vlr. So rest assured

1476
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:19,960
When your vtuber is self-suspense. Yeah, we don't do that here. The girls don't get suspended

1477
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:25,000
I have this terrible thing. It's called a treating people like adults

1478
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,880
And yeah, we don't do suspensions. Uh, if the girls do a naughty, naughty, guess what?

1479
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:35,640
I'm not their mom. I'm not here to spank their butt and be like, you're a naughty naughty girl. Um, so

1480
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,600
yeah

1481
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:42,280
Yeah, the girls do what they want. It's crazy

1482
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:46,600
It's like if you treat people like adults then they kind of act like adults

1483
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,880
It's a wild concept really. It's really crazy in this day and age

1484
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,480
What if she be suspending from the ceiling?

1485
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:01,640
What are your plans for youtube membership? Whatever the girls want to do for membership

1486
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:07,400
They have complete control of I have I am not dictating any talents content at all

1487
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:11,320
I do not dictate it. I do not tell them what to stream. I do not tell them what to do

1488
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:15,320
So what they would like to do in their membership streams are completely up to them

1489
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,760
I do not dictate. We don't dictate in this house

1490
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:23,240
We treat people like adults. Why act like an adult when fondle abyssal?

1491
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,520
It was a bad name. It was one bad name. Okay. They were all bad concept names

1492
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:36,680
But give me credit for freaking emmy bezoo. Come on, man. That's such a cute name. We emmy bezoo

1493
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,600
They say or should I say in a french accent?

1494
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:41,960
Oh

1495
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:44,040
Cran beat right, you know what?

1496
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:47,480
It was a bad name. I admit it. It was a it was a bad name

1497
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:53,400
V sucky the proper V sucky talent fondle abyssal

1498
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,600
Stabitha marks. Oh god

1499
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:02,680
Don't don't put me in the kitchen. I know I'm a woman, but don't put me in the kitchen to cook again because that was awful

1500
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:07,000
Milker tip right right right. You're done. You're done. Right. Hold on

1501
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,320
I'm gonna refresh marshmallow to answer any questions

1502
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:15,720
She be caught in bum live in 30 minutes. I repeat she be caught in bum live in 30 minutes

1503
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,840
Just so you guys can hold out

1504
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,640
Oh

1505
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:26,120
Ivan yankum avano yanko

1506
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,360
Can't answer that one sorry, uh

1507
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,640
Any unique chat rules or behavior guidance?

1508
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,120
Guidances for this agency

1509
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:45,560
Uh, just let the vtuber talk and uh, let the talent talk and if she doesn't like what you're saying she'll say it

1510
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,600
But like obviously because the agency is a bit more

1511
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,280
Uh, obviously the chat can be a bit more

1512
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,560
Uh, yeah

1513
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:00,280
No, she be's gone live in 30

1514
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,160
I'm gonna raid into her and then I'm gonna do my two

1515
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:10,040
2.0, but I don't have to be professional in it like after the stream. Oh, I'm not being very professional right now

1516
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:12,040
I'm a burping into your mouth, but um

1517
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,320
After uh, I'm just memeing as myself. I don't have to do any more official stuff

1518
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,200
Are you rating my bird?

1519
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,560
I'm terminated in 30 minute. You better not be

1520
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,280
get then

1521
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,960
uh

1522
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:33,960
Would it be okay to create fan comics and post online? Absolutely the girls love any fan arts coming through as beautiful

1523
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:41,880
Wait 100 duck sized ryan reynolds or 100 ryan reynolds duck sized

1524
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:43,960
to keep

1525
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:49,080
What what how is that agency related at all? You're just bamboozling me

1526
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:54,120
Um, I know this may be jumping the gun quite a bit

1527
01:37:54,600 --> 01:38:00,600
But based on how you think have you already thought about gen 2 possibilities? Oh, that's a good question. Um

1528
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,560
Uh

1529
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:09,080
For the donathons of the girls one of the goals will be revealing a concept art of gen 2

1530
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:14,520
I understand we've just debuted, but if I'm happy to be as open as you guys are interested

1531
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:19,160
So you're welcome to ask any questions. Uh, but yeah one of uh azure's

1532
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:25,000
Pfft donathons coming up and you guys can vote to reveal a design if you want up to you

1533
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:27,560
um

1534
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:32,040
Someone asked if it's possible. We would have a branch

1535
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:37,960
Um a branch of veiler that didn't require the not-safer work

1536
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,840
audio parts

1537
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,280
In the nicest way

1538
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,360
I

1539
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,400
The cut wouldn't be the same

1540
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,480
I just I couldn't I can't see it working out

1541
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:58,120
Everything is based on what I have learned over the span of many years

1542
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,760
of what is occurring

1543
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,760
Tan cute and funny. I bet she

1544
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,960
She didn't

1545
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:09,800
Okay, I will tell the plan later. You can tell it on your screen if you want to but

1546
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,120
Um

1547
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,240
Will the patreon uploads

1548
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:22,200
Be dictated by the talents. No the content is given by management

1549
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:25,400
I actually have a script manager coming in place soon for the girls

1550
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:31,960
If you have any audios that you don't like, please direct your grievances with me at this stage

1551
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:37,320
And then you can grieve at the manager that's coming in because that can't be our stealing all the scripts

1552
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,440
Um

1553
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,720
Yes

1554
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:52,120
The girls are not pigeonholed into one category of audios that would be impossible to get them to succeed

1555
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:59,640
That is just the truth of the matter. I understand that some of the audios might not play into the thingy

1556
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:04,040
But I cannae have polar bear shags you polar bear shags you again

1557
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:08,360
Polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear

1558
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,840
Be in every single audio

1559
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,840
Please be realistic with me

1560
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,840
That's not gonna appeal to the masses

1561
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:22,360
And at the end of the day, uh, these girls are wanting to move out. They're wanting to save money for their futures

1562
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:27,240
They want to pay off debts possibly this kind of thing. So please

1563
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,920
Please be realistic with us. Okay

1564
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,320
Thank you. I do appreciate that

1565
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:39,000
Um, is there a way to submit scripts for the talents?

1566
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:45,160
Possible plausible at this point in time. I do not have a system in place like that

1567
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:52,040
It is plausible in the future. Uh, you'll have to let things things need to kind of we need to level out and we need to

1568
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,720
um

1569
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:58,680
How do you call it? We need to like settle down the dust hasn't settled literally we're freaking day

1570
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,760
debuted

1571
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:02,760
Um all that kind of thing. Um

1572
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,760
Hmm

1573
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:11,400
How likely are what are off club? How likely are off collabs based on location?

1574
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:15,160
You mean like the girls meeting up?

1575
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,280
I can make it happen

1576
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:23,320
I get taxed back on their travel expenses. I can make that shit happen if they want

1577
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,280
Um

1578
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:36,600
Uh, you said violour does not require the girly pops to get permission for various projects

1579
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,320
Uh, how about showing face?

1580
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:44,520
No, I don't really recommend it for him. Well, uh, so isn't male collabs?

1581
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:47,640
You'll never guess what one of the unwritten rules of ours are

1582
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:50,360
Uh

1583
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,840
There ain't gonna be any males on this. How do you pronounce violour?

1584
01:41:55,240 --> 01:42:00,600
Well, I'm Scottish so the word I look like a luring. You're a luring violour, but

1585
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:02,680
V allure

1586
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:08,920
But if you ever come from a different place, yeah, like feet cam hand cam that stuff's fine. The girls don't need permission for that

1587
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:15,720
Uh, you'll never see my face. Phil stop and I'm a feature. Yeah, I'd say probably face stuff is like

1588
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:20,040
I'll never I'll never stop the talent but

1589
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,560
Um

1590
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,520
Uh

1591
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,440
Oh, this is a good question

1592
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:36,040
Have you started the agency on its own or did you get any sponsors or investors? Nope

1593
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:45,720
So when the agency was becoming an agency, uh, there were actually multiple offers for like split ownership and that kind of thing

1594
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:51,960
The last thing I want is anyone meddling with my girls. So absolutely not

1595
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:58,040
I rejected them all. I have absolutely no interest in anyone else having

1596
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,240
Anything to do ownership wise

1597
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:06,200
Other than knowing that the girls are in my good hands. Okay

1598
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:13,560
Uh, there was also whispers of like, oh, you can sell this this business on if it gets big

1599
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,120
And let me stop you right there

1600
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:21,160
I trust myself for these girls

1601
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:25,320
I do not trust anyone else with these girls

1602
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:31,160
So thank you for your interest in your acquisition your investment

1603
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:35,640
However, if you want to invest, how about you?

1604
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:38,440
invest in some

1605
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,640
merchandise official veal or

1606
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,520
I'm just rolling with you

1607
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:53,080
Uh, why go with patreon over other

1608
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,120
locations

1609
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:01,320
It is safe to link patreon on youtube as long as everything is behind of paywall

1610
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:06,440
There is a large established market on patreon

1611
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:13,000
If there is ever anything to happen, there are multiple websites that can be utilized in case

1612
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:18,040
Please do not worry. Okay. There are many reasons behind

1613
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:24,680
Um developmental wise, but I hope it's kind of here

1614
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,440
a

1615
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:33,560
What are your plans for the future of veal or um for me personally

1616
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:39,800
It is helping the girls achieve their great dreams. A lot of them were interested in 3d models

1617
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:44,280
Um, definitely do that. There's a few that are interested in a few song covers

1618
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:46,840
I'll help them pursue that maybe with their own original song

1619
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:53,800
But my goals are the girls goals. Um, and if you mean my actual personal goals, I'll talk about that in 2.0

1620
01:44:53,800 --> 01:45:00,120
But my goals are the girls goals. Yeah, I want to help them be successful and be happy. Um, yeah, good life

1621
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:07,480
We'll give you the inspiration to make veal or um corporate greed hate

1622
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,080
We hate corporate greed

1623
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,080
That's my sense

1624
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,440
And

1625
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:22,600
I keep seeing people say welcome back. Did you used to be a feature bar before this?

1626
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,160
Um

1627
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:28,680
I'm straw any cuttles. Let's leave it at that. Okay

1628
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:32,440
I'm straw any cuttles and I'm very happy to be here

1629
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:36,440
And if you're a fan of me, you may like to refer to yourself as a refling

1630
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:42,680
And it's a good life. Okay, and thank you guys for being respectful and letting me

1631
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,400
Let me be straw any

1632
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,400
much happy

1633
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:54,360
Uh petition to name your Celtic alternative your scottl fish out there. Oh, that's really creative

1634
01:45:54,440 --> 01:46:00,280
Right, sorry. I should have should have read that should have read that as a as a straw. And let's see if there's any questions

1635
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,160
um

1636
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:07,720
I think that's all the agency questions unless of refresh and there's like a billion more. Oh

1637
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:12,440
That's a lot more questions. I just came through if I didn't say um

1638
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:15,640
We've got 20 minute timer for shibu

1639
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:21,320
Shibu de toilet. All right. Sorry. I'm sorry though. If emmy didn't say that

1640
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:27,000
If emmy didn't say shibu de toilet, I would never have said that myself. I'm so sorry

1641
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:31,800
It was emmy blame emmy. It was emmy. She started it

1642
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:34,840
She started it

1643
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:44,920
Oh my god, I never even told you the funniest thing. So, uh, we had our like we were together for two months before we debuted

1644
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:51,160
And the weirdest thing ever was like, uh instead of like their meetings where like the girls got to know each other

1645
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:55,320
I was like, right. Let's go play among us together for the first time

1646
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:04,920
Oh, so we were like freaking a zero was absolutely smoking us. So I'm going to recalibrate my little leech ever. Hold on my mic

1647
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,760
Okay, there we go. My mic's a bit better than my mic

1648
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:13,800
Um, yeah, we had to like do forced among like for your game

1649
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:20,520
Hey, let me try to say to like make everyone comfortable around each other. Yeah, we played like whiplash

1650
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:27,640
Um, this game where like you can I can't remember the title of it, but it was like really good. It was fun

1651
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,360
um

1652
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,600
Sorry, I just had a little

1653
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:40,200
Jack box that was it. We played like jack box together and stuff

1654
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,680
um

1655
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:44,760
Are the girls free to collab whoever they want?

1656
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,960
Yes, asterix

1657
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:51,160
As long as I've no got a willy

1658
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:54,360
I don't care who they collab with we can go nuts for all I care

1659
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,560
Why are the girls so cute? Is that part of your hypnosis? Have I trained you?

1660
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:02,280
Trained you to like the girl

1661
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:09,960
Uh, how open to merch suggestions? Are you from fans like design ideas and such go for it? But the

1662
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:13,320
You know this this agency's kind of

1663
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:20,760
I'm gonna I need to word my words careful word my words carefully. I am I need to word myself carefully

1664
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,480
but most like

1665
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:28,120
I want to say most agencies aren't so open and taking feedback

1666
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,680
Whereas like I want to say like

1667
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:37,320
Hey, we've literally just started. Of course, we're gonna fuck up here and there something's gonna go wrong

1668
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:43,480
But like we're open to suggestions like oh, I think this is a good idea. I think that's a good idea

1669
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,520
You know

1670
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:49,240
I want to say that

1671
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:53,880
And

1672
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:59,480
Someone says do the talents own the games on the steam account. Oh fucking course

1673
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:07,080
Did you buy the game surprise surprise you get to keep it very very very hard concept

1674
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,800
for some people to comprehend but

1675
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:16,280
Yeah, the talents if they buy it they keep it crazy concept. I know truly

1676
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:19,320
Mindfongling

1677
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,700
Who came up with mersey's design?

1678
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:27,160
Everything is by squishy girl. The website's getting an update

1679
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:32,920
It's actually taken quite long to to produce the update because there's quite a lot of information that's going to be in it

1680
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,440
So give us a hot second to produce that

1681
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:39,640
um

1682
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:46,680
Supposing that someone has an edit in portfolio, can they apply for a video editor?

1683
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:51,640
Yeah, uh clippers editors. Um, I want to try and do a clipping program

1684
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:56,920
Where you get money very like idle. I'm not even gonna like say otherwise

1685
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:03,240
Adel do a clipping program where if you clip the girl every thousand views you get a dollar type thing

1686
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:10,120
I'm quite interested in that style because you're not forced to only clip us you can clip whoever you want on the side

1687
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:12,680
and obviously

1688
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:15,960
Need a wee bit of money to come back in before I can do something like that

1689
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:20,120
But I really do like the concept of it. Very good. Very nice. Very good

1690
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,960
Um, I like it very much

1691
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,960
Uh

1692
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:41,240
Sorry, I'm just I'm just reading some of the questions. I can't say it loud as I read it because it's you know

1693
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:44,680
Um

1694
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,440
Sorry, I'm reading I'm reading just in case

1695
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:52,760
Uh

1696
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:57,000
Hold on. Hold on. I'm reading. I'm reading. I'm reading. You guys are just saying inappropriate stuff about

1697
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,720
sorry the guy the the talent the

1698
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,720
comments are like

1699
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,360
I would do this to ac I would do this to emi and I'm like

1700
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,080
But that's not a question about the agency

1701
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:15,240
How long did it take to get the hired selection progress process? Oh my god

1702
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:18,920
Oh my god, you've just activated my neurons

1703
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:25,640
So the the application pool was open for a month

1704
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:33,320
And then the way the twitter said like in 48 hours or something you're gonna get an email

1705
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:40,680
And someone was like, oh my god, there's no way they're gonna go through all those applications in two days

1706
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:43,240
No, you idiot

1707
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,840
You

1708
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:50,040
Numpty of course we were going through the applications as they came in

1709
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,480
You genuinely thought

1710
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:58,280
That when they close is when agencies go through them

1711
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,120
Come on

1712
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:04,940
Rub those brain cells together

1713
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:10,760
You genuinely think that agencies

1714
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:15,160
Close applications and then start going through them. No

1715
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:20,280
I had a freaking battle royale tier system going on for the girls

1716
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,160
goodness gravy

1717
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:32,200
Goodness gravy some of the comments come on me. I'm no very smart myself, but the moon man you're taking my pass

1718
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:38,440
Uh, are there rules surrounding clipping the talents? Absolutely not go nuts knock yourself out

1719
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,480
Thank you because it costs a lot to pay for clipping

1720
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:48,600
Um, will you ever hire programmers sadly? I don't need a programmer. It's just fix

1721
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:52,440
Hey

1722
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:58,520
Battle royale tier system. Okay, right. I can to you can talk about this

1723
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:03,080
So as the applications came in if I found a girl that was suitable

1724
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:05,960
I would pick out the model for you

1725
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:09,880
And there was first place second place third place

1726
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:12,040
but

1727
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:18,680
The choices were so like obvious to me if it made sense like

1728
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:25,720
Emmy was Emmy. I see was I see, you know, like the choices were so obvious that it was like do the interview

1729
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:33,400
And you're in type thing. Uh, I have a no bullshit apology. I have a no bullshit approach to interviews

1730
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:37,480
So and the girls can talk about it if they so desire. I basically

1731
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,280
Went into the interview with them and I said

1732
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:43,160
Right off the bat. I said, hey

1733
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:47,160
We want you as a talent. You absolutely do not have to impress me in this call

1734
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:50,760
Okay, you don't have to impress me. I want you already

1735
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:55,880
Here's a list of stuff that you need to know before you sign on if you want to sign on. Okay

1736
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:02,520
Did you have a lot of candidates for fondlet? No, Azura was the only like there was no one else for Azura

1737
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:07,320
If Zura rejected that position. I was up shit creek. I'm not even fucking saying nothing

1738
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,920
Yeah

1739
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:13,240
angry scottish is more

1740
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:16,360
um

1741
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:18,360
but yeah, uh

1742
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:22,760
Within like 24 hours people were emailed and that was it

1743
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:31,400
Are you going are your models gonna stick? Oh, sorry. Are you in the

1744
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,960
Models stick to these avatar

1745
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,800
Hey

1746
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:42,200
You mean like new outfits and stuff now the girls can get new outfits or 2.0 or whatever or 3d models perfectly fine with me

1747
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:46,360
Um

1748
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:49,560
Uh

1749
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:56,600
Are you ever worried about your relationship with the girls considering your gen mates and a boss funny you mentioned that I told them

1750
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,240
in the interview

1751
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:04,120
Don't call me boss. Don't refer to me as your boss. Do not think of me as your boss

1752
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,200
I am not your boss

1753
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:11,400
Don't ever place me above you mentally in your head. I do not want that

1754
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:14,040
I am the creative director

1755
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,600
wink wink

1756
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:20,040
So they do not call me boss. They do not call me superior

1757
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:26,040
Yes, she V called me boss ma'am and I was like no, please don't ever

1758
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:32,680
Like do that because I don't want anyone thinking in their head like oh my god. I can't approach her. I can't talk to her

1759
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,200
No, I don't want that

1760
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,840
I don't like them

1761
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:44,520
I don't want anyone to ever think that I am superior to them in any way unless it's their kink

1762
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:48,680
I said it I said it

1763
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,600
Um

1764
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,200
Let me check let me

1765
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,200
Um

1766
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:05,320
Also at the end of the day, I'm not really a boss anymore

1767
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:08,680
Like now that debuts are over everything's like up to the girl

1768
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:13,800
The only boss thing really is like hey, have you recorded that?

1769
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:17,720
Audio for patreon. Yes or no, and then that's it

1770
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
There's nothing else to it

1771
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:23,240
Um

1772
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:28,760
So yeah leader

1773
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:33,400
Yeah, uh, basically just tell them like hey, I did this and I'll show them stats and stuff

1774
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:35,400
And I'm like this is what I think you should do

1775
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:37,800
but they don't really ask for advice because

1776
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,280
Uh, I'll mention I'll repeat this again

1777
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:43,480
All the girls have more streaming experience than me

1778
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:50,280
So it's really hypocritical for me to be like hey go stream this go stream that no I have full faith in these girls

1779
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:56,040
Uh, they are absolutely fantastic. They're lovely everything. I have absolutely no problems

1780
01:56:56,280 --> 01:57:02,040
I have complete faith in them and absolutely nothing is worrisome at all. So

1781
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,920
Yeah

1782
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:11,160
She goes live in eight minutes

1783
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:16,520
Hold on let me get confirmation that I raid into she be's 2.0

1784
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Um for those of you

1785
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,960
Who would like to part ways and join she be's 2.0?

1786
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:24,440
Please absolutely do

1787
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:29,640
Uh, I will also be doing my 2.0 at the exact same time, but I am in uh

1788
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:33,640
I highly recommend you do she burs she sturs

1789
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:39,000
um because she is nothing but an angel and uh

1790
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:45,720
I would love you to support my daughters over me. This is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth

1791
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:53,560
What's my 2.0? I'm I'm gonna answer questions about myself and stuff, but this is kind of more agency focus

1792
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:56,120
Yeah

1793
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,440
Um

1794
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:01,560
Someone asked do you have plans for auditions for gen 2?

1795
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:04,200
My guy

1796
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:06,200
We debuted yesterday

1797
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:11,960
Unless you're actually interested in joining the agency that's different. Um the

1798
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,600
We were a year away from

1799
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:19,640
My focus is on helping these girls achieve their dreams and seeing where we go

1800
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:24,840
You know, you need to let let they've literally just been birthed from my lines

1801
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:30,120
Give them a chance to like, you know get their their knee joints working and all that jazz

1802
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:36,440
Yeah, let's everyone cook first, but it's it's a year away. Um, that we're

1803
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,200
Yeah

1804
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,400
That's

1805
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:50,760
Okay, any questions on youtube because

1806
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:57,080
Marshmallow drying up like my voice box. Honestly, whose voice is it?

1807
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:07,960
You've invested a lot of money into this understand that the marriage goes to the girls, but how exactly do you recoup your investment?

1808
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:10,840
me

1809
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:13,240
I keep 100% of what I

1810
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:16,920
Uh

1811
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:23,160
Don't worry about like thank you very much for worrying about investment costs and stuff, but like this this is big

1812
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:26,520
This is again, not for greed

1813
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:31,800
This is for me to do my thing and I have five lovely girls who I also recommend

1814
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:34,600
And I want them to be able to do their thing

1815
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:38,040
And yeah

1816
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:43,240
Let them cook man. I'll cook don't don't worry about the money. Okay. Don't worry about the money some things in life are

1817
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:45,560
more important than

1818
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:46,600
great

1819
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:53,480
And I don't mean you're implying that I'm greedy because obviously everyone wants to return on investment if you will but

1820
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:57,480
Let's just have a good time. Like I'm playing Assassin's Creed tomorrow

1821
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:00,600
I'm going to tell you about that some of the developmental lore of that game

1822
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:06,680
I'm going to tell you a little tip bits about glitches that occur in that game. I'm just here for a good time

1823
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:09,240
Okay

1824
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:12,120
Uh

1825
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:15,320
When was velar started? Uh, it's been a one year

1826
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:21,160
Development. Uh, actually I'm going to give you the name of the song the girls were

1827
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:25,640
Uh, I was the girls were concepted. Oh god. Was it?

1828
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:42,120
All right, this is the song. Sorry. I just completely went off in my head

1829
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:46,440
This is the song the girls, uh, were birthed to

1830
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:49,320
one year ago

1831
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:53,720
This song so open that up in a oh should be started

1832
02:00:55,560 --> 02:01:01,480
Is we cheaper start is to be cheaper started. Okay. Okay. Are there any games that can't be played?

1833
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,280
Uh

1834
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:07,480
For legal reason? No

1835
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:11,400
Because we're not a Japanese based company

1836
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:18,200
We don't have to worry about that copyright shit that other agencies are like fucking tied to

1837
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
It's not a rec roll

1838
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:32,920
So that's the song that the girls were made to see and give a listen to uh, I am going to end the stream

1839
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:37,800
