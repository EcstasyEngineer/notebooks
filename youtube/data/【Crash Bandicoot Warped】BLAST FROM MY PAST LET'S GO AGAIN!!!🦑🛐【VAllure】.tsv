0	6000	Mummy, the mummy hasn't abandoned no thing.
6000	12000	Mummy is in a foolish, foolish streamer.
12000	16000	When I did the footstream, I put my ring light.
16000	21000	I had to move my ring light so I could elimp the shit and put it down to the wall.
21000	27000	As it eliminate that mummy started streaming on her hands and knees, it's not what she did.
27000	32000	I need the ring light.
32000	37000	The thing that is flashing is the goofy and it's jumping about everywhere.
37000	40000	It went on and on.
40000	43000	So that is going to be the light.
43000	46000	Please, it's the only light.
46000	48000	Okay.
48000	50000	Alright, my face is eliminated.
50000	54000	I'm also on reactive mode so I'm actually going to react to the game.
54000	64000	Everyone knows I have an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 with 10,067 megabits.
64000	67000	Hello, good morning.
67000	69000	Let me put it on.
69000	71000	Live chat.
71000	74000	Any live chatter?
80000	83000	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
83000	86000	I apologize if I sound tired.
86000	92000	I passed out after that RuneScape stream and I woke up 45 minutes ago.
92000	96000	I hope Icy's monetization stream went fantastic.
96000	98000	I believe Emmys is also today.
98000	103000	So if there's any pin pals or snowberries, they're down the hall.
103000	106000	Into the lift.
106000	109000	I apologize if I sound tired.
109000	110000	I am exhausted.
110000	111000	I don't know how.
111000	116000	I slept for so long.
116000	119000	I don't know what is going on with me.
119000	120000	But I've got cup of tea.
120000	121000	I've got two waters.
121000	123000	I've got a wee muffin.
123000	126000	And then we can jump into Crash Bandicoot.
126000	138000	As for any updates, since I slept, I have absolutely nothing.
138000	144000	A refling sent me a three page story, which I really liked.
144000	148000	But for legal reasons, I cannot speak any of it here.
149000	156000	I've also put together a little folder of BibBits.
156000	159000	Which I don't know why I didn't think to do it earlier.
159000	164000	But now I'm putting it all together.
164000	166000	Oh and a refling sent me a five minute audio.
166000	168000	And he was like, talk!
168000	172000	I was like, oh my god, reflings are getting so brave, honestly.
172000	177000	And before I die a lot, probably, probably, I'm not even going to put it behind me.
177000	182000	I don't know what level the desktop, how loud the game is going to be compared to me.
182000	187000	But give me a three page story.
187000	195000	It was about me, obviously.
195000	197000	But yes, you guys have been doing fantastic.
197000	199000	I believe AC has done well.
199000	203000	I don't really have any updates about anything else at the moment.
203000	208000	Other than my freaking ASMR meme video, I've got 30k views.
208000	212000	And I'm like, right, this has definitely left the target audience.
212000	215000	Because I had 5,000 subscribers when I posted that.
215000	217000	And now we're at 6,000.
217000	221000	I'm like, bruv, that like propelled my channel.
221000	225000	So I'm waiting, Mercy's is going to go up after this stream.
225000	232000	Or, or it's going to go up after she finishes her stream today.
233000	235000	And then AC's is ready to go up.
235000	240000	I may actually, I'm going to message her right now so she can reply to me.
240000	251000	And see, when you finished stream, do you want me to upload your meme ASMR on your behalf question mark?
251000	256000	And before you're like, wait, why are you asking the girls permission to do stuff that you made for them?
256000	259000	Because it's their channels.
259000	261000	I don't want them to be unhappy.
261000	264000	I want them to be happy little ducklings with me.
269000	270000	Who up?
270000	272000	Bandy their cooter.
272000	273000	Whoa.
273000	274000	Okay.
274000	277000	I'm getting a bit too close to that one.
277000	280000	Any Bandy cooters?
280000	282000	It's only such a sweetheart.
282000	284000	Yes, I don't want to do anything that upsets the girls.
284000	287000	And if they're like, no, now's not the time to upload the meme ASMR.
288000	290000	That's fine.
292000	296000	So I'll get permission from them and then possibly after the stream.
296000	299000	Apparently it takes eight hours to do this game.
299000	304000	Now, I'ma just say, I was a atom when I played this game.
304000	306000	I have barely any recollection.
306000	308000	My dad didn't buy it for me.
308000	310000	He bought it for himself.
310000	313000	Johnny, congrats on 6.5k.
313000	316000	No, I owe so many ASMR videos.
316000	319000	I was going to try and get my first thank you video out.
319000	321000	Oh.
321000	324000	Well, maybe after buckshot roulette after the doc.
324000	326000	Because I've got buckshot roulette.
326000	327000	Then I've got a couple hours.
327000	329000	Then I go to the doctor.
329000	331000	Is this a rhythm game?
331000	332000	It is not.
332000	333000	It's Crash Bandicoot.
333000	337000	It is an adventure platformer.
337000	339000	I know you can't hear the background of the game right now.
339000	341000	So it's just my voice in this room.
341000	343000	Do forgive.
343000	345000	Strongly winning a game.
345000	347000	Any ganky desks?
347000	350000	Hold on, let me hydrate with my tea.
352000	354000	I owe so much ASMR.
354000	355000	I do have it all recorded.
355000	357000	I just need to sit and edit it.
357000	362000	And I can't upload the clapping without using my hands ASMR.
362000	365000	Yet, I need to have some things in between it.
368000	370000	Strongly winning much and everything right.
370000	371000	It's a never ending move.
371000	375000	Every time she releases an ASMR, she gains 1k and she gets to go back to square one.
375000	377000	Honestly, I'm like, I hope not.
377000	379000	I think it will definitely calm down a bit.
379000	380000	It's going to have to calm down.
380000	385000	Because as much as our capitalist overlords love infinite growth,
385000	386000	that's just not plausible here.
386000	390000	Nor is it something that is healthy or thingy.
390000	393000	Because if you start measuring yourself by numbers and that kind of thing,
393000	396000	that's when, I think that's when VJubers probably get it in their head.
396000	398000	They're like, oh, I'm not doing well enough.
398000	399000	I'm not performing well enough.
399000	402000	And it's like, Brev, you haven't even given yourself a chance.
402000	404000	Just have fun.
406000	410000	People can tell you're sweating on trends if you're trying to sweat on trends, you know?
410000	412000	And then people can tell when you're just meaming around,
412000	414000	when you're just meaming around, you know?
414000	415000	And guess what?
415000	419000	You know, some streamers, sorry, this has just turned into a philosophical,
419000	424000	let's digest and get to the roots of why streamers are streamers.
424000	429000	Some people are just, what's the word,
429000	434000	optimized to have a nice, cosy, tight-knit community.
434000	435000	Okay?
435000	438000	Some people, some of your personalities, other streamers,
438000	441000	you're just supposed to have a nice little tight-knit community.
441000	444000	You're not supposed to be for the masses, you know?
444000	448000	So don't always be reaching for the fricking stratosphere, the stars.
448000	452000	Don't always be reaching for the stars when you do just fine in the stratosphere, you know?
453000	456000	Every time you gain 1k, you release an ASMR that gains you 1k.
456000	459000	So it's an infinite feedback loop you'll be at.
459000	462000	Infinity subs by the end of the week.
462000	463000	Not quite.
463000	467000	Especially those looking to extract numbers from TikTok that only have 100 subs,
467000	470000	but say they deserve a million views on every post.
470000	472000	Yes.
474000	480000	I can actually get into the psychology on why people feel they deserve subscribers,
480000	487000	versus others who feel unworthy of what they get because of what they've done.
487000	492000	I could definitely go on an algorithm stream that in, not tinfoil time,
492000	496000	no it's not tinfoil, it's not tinfoil, it's not tinfoil.
496000	502000	It's like human psychology as well as the damage that the internet does to the mind.
502000	507000	Cos if you didn't know, you're actually not supposed to be exposed to,
508000	513000	I think you're not supposed to actually know more than 100 faces at once,
513000	516000	and your brain is just not wired for any other way.
516000	521000	After that, your brain can only be wired to recognise tribes, which sounds terrible,
521000	527000	but that's just how it is, so it's like, ah, I am approaching the AC clan, you know?
527000	529000	Or the tribe.
529000	531000	Are you studying psychology?
531000	534000	Absolutely not, I have had enough of education.
534000	537000	I say that, I might be going back to beauty school,
537000	542000	but that's for, I'm talking like five years down the line beauty school type thing,
544000	551000	because I might want to run an ASMR room studio type thing,
551000	554000	but that's just me, that's just me.
556000	559000	Need a tinfoil hat or more?
559000	561000	For the reflins?
561000	563000	Honestly, I'm so down for that.
563000	566000	I need the meds to moat back, I need the thigh gripper moat back,
566000	568000	all other emotes that I need back.
568000	573000	I was actually going to ask if a refling has any batch to emotes,
573000	580000	so wink wink, if you could send me a cat box file of the batch itself,
580000	585000	so I know what to reorder, because I picked what I wanted.
585000	590000	Just so you know, just so we're all on the same, I picked what I wanted.
591000	593000	Oh yeah, Crash Bandicoot 3.
593000	597000	Yes, so I was but an atom and my dad bought this game for himself,
597000	604000	and the only thing I remember doing on this game is playing Coco on China
604000	607000	and using the horse all the time.
607000	610000	The horse, the tiger all the time.
610000	616000	I'll have to catch stream later as I'm working on eight slides of insurance termed out.
617000	619000	Even the thought of that is terrible.
622000	627000	I don't know what's going on with my teas, I've not been enjoying them as of late.
627000	631000	I'm getting a bit nervous, I'm getting a bit shaky why I'm not enjoying my teas,
631000	635000	because normally I'm all over them.
635000	639000	Although I have been enjoying this fruit juice company thing,
639000	642000	and they put loads of fruit in the juice, and then they juice it,
642000	645000	and then I drink the juice, and then I get all the goodness in me.
646000	647000	Yeah.
650000	655000	I've had too many teas, this is a very plausible and realistic sense.
655000	659000	Although I've only had one tea the day, I'll literally only, I woke up like,
659000	662000	well I woke up an hour ago now,
662000	666000	woke up, spammed the PC on, started spamming pre-chat for a few moments,
666000	669000	checked out AC to see what's going on with her, she's fine,
669000	672000	checked out the Discord to see if the girls are fine, they're fine,
673000	676000	refueling, slacking flavour lately.
676000	680000	You're not enjoying the tea because it's all just special, aren't you?
682000	686000	Oh my god, it sounds terrible, but should I just get a cola?
686000	691000	I don't think drinking a cola first thing in the morning is a good idea though.
691000	694000	It's a terrible idea.
696000	699000	Okay, let's get into Crash Bandicoot.
700000	702000	Any Crash Bandicooters?
706000	709000	Is that too loud? Or is that fine?
710000	711000	Oh my god.
714000	717000	How do I leave? Oh, my controller isn't even awake, hold on.
717000	719000	Yeah, plug my controller in.
722000	725000	So there's three games in it, I've only ever played Warped,
725000	728000	I don't know what the other two are about.
729000	731000	Hey, I guess the game.
733000	734000	Override save.
736000	737000	Is it too loud?
737000	740000	Guys, groovy as anything, maybe turn it down a little.
740000	743000	Okay, I'll do it in the start menu after the cutscene.
746000	748000	Oh, we're crashing?
748000	751000	Oh, I guess we are called Crash Bandicoot.
753000	754000	Thank you.
760000	765000	Oh my god, that's so beautiful.
770000	772000	Oh, it kinda looks like a Snow Berry.
772000	773000	Snow Berry.
789000	793000	Oh my god, this is so beautiful, this game.
802000	805000	It was that Infernal Bandicoot.
805000	807000	Bandicoot.
814000	818000	Oh, wait, it's a Tiki Mask, like Earth Tiki Mask guy.
818000	819000	Okay.
826000	827000	Oh.
831000	832000	What?
848000	849000	Insane.
859000	861000	Oh, I don't remember any of this.
862000	864000	Whoa, fuck it.
864000	867000	Oh, that was a flashbang first thing in the morning.
867000	868000	Did you see that?
879000	881000	I can't see anymore.
885000	889000	Oh my god, this game is so beautiful and cool.
897000	899000	For real, I think I just got a virus.
899000	910000	Oh, wait, wait, wait, I remember something like that.
916000	919000	Oh my gosh, that was so beautiful.
919000	920000	Wait, hold on.
920000	922000	I need to turn down the volume a little bit.
922000	923000	My apologies.
923000	927000	Game options, music, 8.
927000	928000	Wait.
937000	939000	Oh, I could do this all day.
940000	942000	We'll do 8s.
946000	947000	Oh my god.
947000	950000	Oh, wait, you can't control the camera angle.
953000	954000	What does Y do?
954000	956000	Y shows me my light, what does B do?
957000	958000	No.
958000	961000	Oh my god, POV, I'm coming for AC.
961000	964000	I'm a snowberry going for AC.
966000	970000	Oh my god, on the prowl, on the prowl.
970000	971000	I'm an Oji-san.
971000	975000	Come to me, AC, my princess.
975000	977000	Daddy wants...
980000	983000	Oh my god, this is so precious.
983000	985000	This is so cool.
986000	990000	Oh my god, wait, I remember these symbols a little bit.
999000	1000000	No.
1003000	1006000	I mean, it's more powerful because I'm the goodie.
1006000	1007000	You're the baddie.
1010000	1013000	Oh my god, right.
1013000	1014000	Where does this work?
1015000	1018000	Oh my god.
1018000	1019000	Oh my god, this is like, you can...
1019000	1022000	Oh my god, we flints, we're already on the farm.
1022000	1024000	10 out of 10 game, we're already on the farm.
1024000	1025000	Wait, how do I do that?
1026000	1028000	To jump to spin to crutch for inventory.
1028000	1030000	Why would I need to see my inventory?
1030000	1033000	I guess if you're going for like 100%, but...
1034000	1037000	Oh my god, we can bomb.
1038000	1040000	This game is beautiful.
1040000	1041000	Don't remember that.
1041000	1042000	Does that need to hurt it?
1042000	1043000	Oh no, we spanked it.
1043000	1044000	Right, we spanked it.
1044000	1045000	We didn't kill it.
1045000	1046000	We spanked it away.
1048000	1049000	Okay, it's fine.
1051000	1052000	Oh god.
1053000	1054000	Oh my god.
1058000	1060000	Oh no, thank you for the 5.
1061000	1063000	Okay, I can definitely take fall damage.
1064000	1065000	Oh my...
1065000	1066000	Checkpoint.
1067000	1068000	I'm remembering.
1068000	1069000	Wait, go back on the farm.
1069000	1070000	Go back on the farm.
1070000	1071000	What does this do?
1073000	1076000	Okay, if you hit it at a certain time.
1076000	1078000	Oh my god, we're on the farm.
1078000	1079000	Right, frogs.
1079000	1081000	Frogs can hurt us.
1081000	1083000	Go back on the farm, where you belong.
1090000	1093000	Oh my god, I can spank everyone.
1093000	1094000	Oh, I love this game.
1094000	1096000	Wait, how about if I get two of the good bookers?
1096000	1098000	Oh, he's glowing.
1098000	1099000	Oh, you are glowing.
1099000	1100000	What the heck is it?
1102000	1103000	What did I do?
1103000	1104000	Where am I going?
1106000	1107000	Oh no.
1107000	1108000	What's this?
1109000	1110000	Oh, it's bone.
1110000	1113000	I got an achievement for doing this.
1114000	1116000	It's a bonus level.
1116000	1117000	Wow.
1123000	1125000	Is this just like free apples?
1125000	1126000	Oh my apples.
1126000	1128000	I never picked them up.
1129000	1131000	Oh my god, that's so cool.
1133000	1136000	Fa la la la la la la.
1136000	1138000	Who's farm the dream?
1138000	1140000	The bleeding hearts are getting spanked.
1140000	1141000	For real, for real.
1141000	1143000	A wimper fruit.
1143000	1145000	A wimper fruit.
1145000	1147000	One puff, one puff fruit.
1147000	1149000	Go back to the farm.
1150000	1154000	Oh, we trick shot it with the bleeding heart.
1154000	1155000	We trick shot it.
1155000	1157000	Go back to the farm.
1157000	1159000	No frog for gen two.
1160000	1164000	Oh my god, Shibi really wants a slim girl for gen two.
1164000	1166000	I don't know how to break it to her.
1167000	1170000	She really wants a gen two.
1170000	1173000	I'm just like, maybe I'll give Shibi a Halloween outfit.
1173000	1175000	Wait, have we already been here before?
1175000	1177000	Or is this just kind of the same layout?
1179000	1180000	Okay, and spank.
1180000	1181000	What?
1181000	1182000	It's pink.
1185000	1187000	Why is there a gap in this bridge?
1188000	1191000	We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.
1192000	1193000	No slim girl?
1193000	1196000	No, maybe I'll give Shibi a slim Halloween outfit.
1196000	1197000	How about that?
1198000	1199000	Slim girls.
1200000	1201000	I get it.
1201000	1202000	What?
1202000	1205000	Oh, wait, so if you miss it, you'll...
1205000	1206000	Okay.
1206000	1208000	I missed a box.
1208000	1210000	Stinky, I don't know where it was.
1212000	1214000	Slim girls are my favorite monster girl.
1214000	1216000	Oh, but slimes are hot.
1217000	1218000	I'm not sure.
1218000	1219000	I don't know.
1220000	1222000	Oh, they came out of my ear hole.
1222000	1223000	Oops.
1223000	1225000	And then we just go back in Indra too.
1225000	1227000	Oh my god, that's cool.
1227000	1229000	This game is easy.
1229000	1231000	I like how fun and easy it is here.
1232000	1233000	Lamia's are my favorite.
1233000	1235000	I would entertain a Lamia.
1236000	1238000	Oh, the fisher thing.
1239000	1240000	To kick fast.
1242000	1243000	Whoa!
1244000	1245000	Whoa!
1245000	1247000	Okay, wait, that was very dumb.
1247000	1249000	Sorry, that was incredibly dumb.
1251000	1254000	Whoa, this game's so pretty.
1255000	1258000	Sorry, I've not got much accuracy under the war,
1258000	1259000	even though I'm a cuttlefish.
1259000	1260000	I know.
1260000	1261000	I don't want to...
1262000	1263000	Did I just like go past them?
1263000	1265000	Wait, that's a checkpoint.
1266000	1267000	Oh my gosh!
1267000	1269000	I remember something like this.
1269000	1271000	I used to be so scared of it as a child.
1271000	1273000	I thought I only remembered Coco.
1275000	1277000	I can hear a box back there.
1278000	1280000	Wait, what does that shark do?
1280000	1281000	Please email him.
1281000	1282000	Oh, there's a sand dollar.
1283000	1284000	On the ground.
1285000	1286000	Whoa, there's...
1287000	1289000	Jeez, this game is so cute.
1290000	1292000	I can't believe I didn't play this before.
1292000	1293000	Well, I mean...
1294000	1295000	Sorry, I got scared.
1295000	1297000	I don't know if I can hurt those pufferfish.
1298000	1299000	Checkpoint.
1299000	1300000	Checkpoint.
1300000	1301000	Why checkpoint?
1302000	1304000	What's here that shouldn't be here?
1304000	1306000	Is there something below that's going to kill me?
1306000	1307000	Because why did I get a checkpoint?
1311000	1313000	You can switch to play Coco.
1317000	1318000	Oh!
1319000	1321000	Oh my gosh.
1322000	1323000	What?
1323000	1325000	No wonder this game did so good.
1325000	1326000	It's like so creative.
1327000	1328000	Bomb, bomb, bomb.
1328000	1331000	Oh, there's hidden boxes under the coral rays.
1331000	1332000	That's okay.
1333000	1334000	We're not going for 100%
1334000	1337000	because I don't know how to 100% this game.
1337000	1339000	But we can go for lots of fruit.
1340000	1341000	Probably yummy yummy fruit.
1343000	1345000	Oh, I can beat shark up in this.
1346000	1348000	And I can explode things in this.
1348000	1349000	Let's go.
1349000	1350000	Oh no, I broke it.
1350000	1351000	I'm sorry.
1352000	1353000	I'm a bit of a klutz.
1353000	1354000	I accidentally broke it.
1357000	1358000	Bomb, bomb, bomb.
1359000	1360000	Oh wait, that's not the song anymore.
1360000	1361000	It's whatever the underwater.
1361000	1362000	Oh!
1365000	1367000	Sure, we'll get these boxes.
1367000	1368000	I think it's safe enough.
1370000	1371000	Oh my god.
1372000	1374000	What do you mean I'm so in love with a game
1374000	1376000	that's got the difficulty for literal children?
1377000	1378000	I can't believe it.
1378000	1379000	The accusations are unfounded.
1380000	1381000	I play Skyrim on Legendary mode
1382000	1383000	just because you can.
1383000	1384000	It doesn't mean you need to be...
1384000	1385000	Wait, can I hurt this?
1386000	1388000	Oh no, I can beat up the little puffer fish.
1389000	1390000	Oh, the purple puffers.
1392000	1393000	Okay, there we go.
1394000	1395000	Whoa, there's the prank crystal.
1396000	1397000	Okay, let's get it.
1398000	1399000	Wait, is that going to explode?
1400000	1401000	Oh wow!
1401000	1403000	Oh, if you don't do it in time,
1403000	1404000	it becomes a solid.
1405000	1406000	Okay, that's curious.
1407000	1409000	Is it hard to get 100%?
1409000	1411000	Oh, I missed a lot of boxes this time.
1412000	1413000	Didn't do that good this time.
1413000	1414000	But it's okay.
1415000	1417000	I'm happy just loving everything.
1418000	1420000	The scene reminds me so much of Jack and Dax, though.
1421000	1422000	Jack and Dax.
1423000	1425000	Oh, I threw that one up this time,
1425000	1426000	so it doesn't always come out your ear.
1427000	1428000	Wee!
1428000	1429000	The Orient Express.
1430000	1431000	Coco!
1432000	1433000	Oh, this is the mission!
1434000	1436000	Oh my god, this is the mission.
1436000	1437000	Ah!
1438000	1439000	Coco!
1440000	1441000	And we're for the Tigers.
1441000	1442000	They missed!
1442000	1443000	Oh my god!
1443000	1444000	Oh my god!
1445000	1446000	Oh my god!
1447000	1448000	Oh my god!
1448000	1449000	I know it's like first thing in the morning,
1449000	1450000	but I'm so happy!
1451000	1452000	Oh my god!
1452000	1454000	This is the mission that I always remember
1454000	1455000	from childhood.
1456000	1457000	Oh my god!
1457000	1458000	Go, Coco!
1458000	1459000	Go, Coco!
1460000	1461000	You're doing it!
1461000	1462000	Oh, you're so beautiful!
1463000	1464000	Oh my god!
1464000	1465000	It's the music!
1468000	1469000	Get it, get it, get it, get it!
1469000	1470000	Get it, get it!
1472000	1473000	Oh my god!
1473000	1474000	Get it, get it, get it!
1474000	1475000	Yes!
1479000	1481000	Oh no, I hurt myself.
1481000	1483000	Oh, I didn't know what I was supposed to do there.
1483000	1484000	I forgot.
1484000	1486000	I forgot, but I got a checkpoint, so it's okay.
1486000	1487000	Oh, I jumped into it!
1487000	1488000	Coco, no!
1488000	1489000	No!
1490000	1491000	Oh, but it's okay.
1491000	1494000	The Tiger forgives me for being a terrible driver.
1495000	1496000	Oh, I did it again!
1496000	1497000	Oh shit!
1497000	1498000	Stop jumping!
1498000	1499000	What happens?
1501000	1502000	Oh, okay.
1502000	1503000	No more jumping.
1503000	1504000	No jumpies.
1504000	1505000	Jumpies, no.
1505000	1506000	But no jumpies.
1506000	1508000	And then big boy jumpies.
1508000	1509000	Oh, I missed.
1509000	1510000	What the heck?
1510000	1511000	I was so close.
1511000	1513000	Oh, if I run ahead, I can attack.
1516000	1517000	Run!
1517000	1518000	Tiger!
1520000	1521000	Oh, how can you?
1522000	1523000	Oh no!
1523000	1524000	It's so bad!
1525000	1526000	Oh my god!
1527000	1529000	Wait, what happens if I run out of lives?
1529000	1530000	Is it over?
1531000	1532000	Is it over for me?
1533000	1534000	This is over for me?
1534000	1536000	Wait, can I just run ahead and hurt them?
1537000	1538000	Whee!
1538000	1540000	Whoa, that was a freaking leap and a half!
1541000	1542000	Call me Joe Leeper,
1542000	1545000	because one Tiger run is all it takes.
1545000	1546000	Whee!
1547000	1548000	Oh my god!
1549000	1551000	That's such a good mission!
1552000	1554000	Oh, my little Tizer!
1555000	1560000	Soft, giddy, warm, giddy, little ball of fluff.
1561000	1563000	Oh, that's the best mission in the entire game.
1563000	1565000	Okay, we can end stream now.
1565000	1566000	That's all we needed to do.
1572000	1574000	That's all we needed to do.
1576000	1579000	I don't know what the diamond is.
1580000	1581000	Right, what we got next.
1581000	1583000	The Boneyard!
1586000	1587000	There are like three more of that?
1587000	1588000	Oh my god!
1604000	1605000	What?
1608000	1609000	Oh no!
1610000	1613000	Neurons activated from childhood.
1613000	1615000	Oh no!
1615000	1618000	I think I get chased this entire mission!
1619000	1620000	Oh no!
1621000	1623000	Oh no, there's lava everywhere!
1623000	1625000	It's jumping faster!
1626000	1628000	Oh, I don't know, I'm jumping faster!
1628000	1629000	Oh my god!
1629000	1630000	Wait, why did you do that?
1630000	1631000	Crash, crash!
1631000	1633000	Crash, why did you do that?
1633000	1635000	Crash, jump, crash!
1636000	1639000	Crash, you need to jump like double jump!
1639000	1641000	Whoa, wait, I can't do it!
1644000	1647000	Wait, can I just stay here forever in the tower?
1647000	1650000	Is that a Tyrannosaurus talk or something like that?
1651000	1652000	Wait, why can I not jump that?
1652000	1654000	Can you double jump it again?
1655000	1656000	Oh, is it that?
1656000	1657000	Jump, spin?
1657000	1660000	Whoa, I could hardly get over that!
1660000	1661000	Oh no!
1662000	1665000	I can't believe it, childhood me strikes again!
1666000	1667000	Can I not double jump?
1667000	1668000	Hold the jump!
1669000	1670000	Hold the jump?
1671000	1672000	What the heck?
1672000	1673000	I'm not going to make it!
1673000	1675000	I'm going to run out of life!
1676000	1677000	Oh no!
1678000	1679000	Wait!
1680000	1682000	Wait, it's not doing anything!
1682000	1683000	Hold on, let's practice.
1683000	1687000	Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump!
1687000	1688000	Jump?
1695000	1697000	I don't know how to double jump.
1701000	1703000	It's not letting me double jump.
1703000	1706000	Oh, it is letting me double jump.
1706000	1708000	Wait, but I jumped right into it!
1709000	1714000	Oh my god, it's so over and the stream hasn't even freaking started!
1714000	1716000	I can't figure it double jump.
1716000	1717000	Is my input wrong?
1717000	1720000	I'm holding A on my controller.
1720000	1721000	There is no double jump.
1721000	1722000	He is...
1727000	1729000	I'm getting so confused.
1730000	1732000	Is this a child's game or not?
1732000	1733000	Answer me!
1733000	1736000	Is this game for kids to complete or not?
1736000	1738000	It's not looking good.
1738000	1740000	Can't even get through the first freaking jump!
1743000	1745000	Dash jump is one way.
1746000	1748000	It's for kids.
1748000	1751000	I'm getting filtered by level 3 actually.
1751000	1753000	I don't know how to do it.
1753000	1756000	I'm like trying to extend the jump.
1756000	1759000	But there's nothing to extend it.
1759000	1761000	It's just a street magma jump!
1764000	1767000	You unlock double jump after beating a boss.
1768000	1771000	Wait, so leave and then go to beat a boss and come back?
1772000	1775000	Are you holding your jump button down instead of tapping?
1775000	1778000	If I tap, hold, tap.
1779000	1781000	Holding, tapping.
1781000	1783000	Right, hold A.
1783000	1784000	Holding A.
1784000	1785000	Fuck!
1787000	1789000	Holding A.
1789000	1791000	This is me holding A!
1791000	1796000	Okay, it just seems to be like so tiny and slate.
1797000	1799000	Like minuscule.
1800000	1802000	Right, this is the furthest I've ever got.
1802000	1804000	Don't mess up now.
1804000	1806000	Don't mess up now.
1807000	1810000	Okay, I need a breather honestly.
1810000	1812000	Alright, I'm just going to keep going.
1812000	1814000	Oh my god!
1814000	1816000	Why was that so hot?
1816000	1818000	Oh, that's TNT!
1819000	1821000	That's more TNT!
1822000	1823000	They explode!
1823000	1825000	Okay, we did it.
1825000	1829000	Oh gee, willikers, I sure hope we don't have to do that segment again,
1829000	1832000	because what the heck, why was that so hard?
1832000	1834000	I literally have no double jump open.
1834000	1836000	You should try jumping over them.
1838000	1840000	Timing matters.
1840000	1842000	What's this?
1842000	1844000	Oh, a platform?
1844000	1846000	I don't have access to it.
1846000	1848000	Go away, you scared me.
1849000	1851000	Oh my god, it's discord nature!
1851000	1853000	Did this...
1853000	1855000	What does that do?
1857000	1861000	Okay, well, I remember what it does now.
1861000	1863000	Wait, can I do this?
1863000	1866000	Go away, you're so creepy!
1866000	1868000	Where are you?
1868000	1871000	Oh, bonus time, bonus time!
1871000	1873000	That's what it does.
1873000	1875000	Don't touch the nature.
1875000	1878000	No discord daddies.
1878000	1881000	No discord groomers in the velar.
1883000	1885000	Good luck.
1888000	1890000	Bounce?
1890000	1892000	Bounce?
1893000	1895000	Oh my god, free life!
1895000	1897000	Well, I definitely needed that after how...
1899000	1902000	Why is he so slow when he crouches?
1904000	1906000	Okay, I like the bonus distance.
1906000	1908000	Where's the key?
1909000	1913000	I tried to tap crouch when walking to get faster.
1913000	1915000	Tap crouch while walking.
1915000	1920000	Oh, every hundred apples, I get a life.
1920000	1923000	Ah, those things are so scary.
1925000	1927000	Exclamation mark.
1927000	1930000	What the heck did I just do?
1930000	1932000	Oh no, I was supposed to jump.
1932000	1934000	I missed the jump.
1934000	1937000	I was supposed to jump on top of the moku.
1940000	1942000	I don't like this camera angle.
1942000	1944000	No, this is why I didn't like the camera angle.
1944000	1946000	It felt like I was going to get chased again.
1946000	1949000	Okay, give me the checkpoint at least.
1951000	1953000	Oh, there's...
1953000	1955000	Gate the way up.
1955000	1957000	No, no, no!
1957000	1959000	Wait, what was that?
1959000	1961000	Crash? Crash?
1961000	1963000	Did you just stand on lava and let me win?
1964000	1966000	Oh my God, the game feels so bad for me.
1966000	1968000	That is letting me win.
1968000	1970000	It feels so bad for me.
1970000	1972000	Please don't slow me down.
1972000	1974000	Oh my God, get me out of here.
1974000	1976000	Oh, get me out of here.
1976000	1977000	I'm not playing this level again.
1977000	1979000	Wampa roots, they're wampas.
1979000	1980000	Sorry.
1980000	1983000	Oh my God, the game felt so bad it let me walk on lava.
1985000	1987000	Oh, that came up more.
1987000	1989000	Honestly, me right now.
1989000	1991000	Did I do four there?
1991000	1992000	Yes, I did.
1992000	1994000	Right, we're not playing that one again.
1994000	1996000	That one was stinky.
1996000	1998000	We're doing five.
1998000	2000000	We're doing...
2000000	2002000	Oh, Coco!
2002000	2004000	What's this one?
2004000	2006000	Making waves.
2006000	2008000	Course...
2008000	2010000	Huh?
2010000	2012000	To accelerate, right trigger.
2012000	2014000	There's no backwards.
2014000	2016000	Oh my God, it's so wobbly, wobbly!
2016000	2018000	Whee!
2018000	2020000	Jump shot!
2021000	2023000	Oh my God, this is...
2023000	2025000	Oh, there's a bomba.
2025000	2027000	Wait, wait, let me get the bomba.
2027000	2029000	Trick shot, trick shot, trick shot, trick shot.
2029000	2030000	Oh, 360.
2030000	2032000	I missed fast, okay.
2032000	2034000	360!
2034000	2036000	She's actually doing spins.
2036000	2038000	I'm not doing any input for her to do those spins, by the way.
2038000	2040000	I'm just jumping on it.
2040000	2042000	Oh, there's bombas!
2042000	2044000	Bomba!
2047000	2049000	Oh no, I've only got seven lives.
2049000	2051000	Oh well, I just regained a new one.
2051000	2053000	Okay.
2053000	2055000	This is a child's game.
2055000	2057000	Children can play this, so I can play this.
2057000	2060000	For I too, I'm wise enough to play a child's game.
2060000	2062000	Surely.
2062000	2064000	Surely I won't have to run out of lives.
2064000	2066000	If I play the same game,
2066000	2068000	like same level over and over,
2068000	2070000	did I just get infinite lives?
2070000	2072000	Because we might have to farm lives
2072000	2074000	unironically.
2074000	2076000	Right, hold on, what's going on here?
2076000	2078000	No, yes, yes.
2078000	2081000	Okay, we made it, and we're going to get this checkpoint.
2081000	2083000	Excuse me?
2083000	2085000	I said we're going to get this checkpoint.
2085000	2087000	Coco!
2087000	2088000	Oh my god.
2088000	2090000	Edging me right now.
2090000	2092000	Wow!
2092000	2094000	Oh, that was close, that was close.
2094000	2096000	I was a bit too close for comfort.
2096000	2098000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2098000	2100000	Timon's going to be fine.
2100000	2102000	Oh, there's a seagull!
2102000	2104000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2104000	2107000	Slow it down, slow it down.
2107000	2109000	Slow and steady, when's the race?
2109000	2111000	Do I need to go 100 miles per minute?
2111000	2113000	Wah!
2113000	2115000	Honestly?
2115000	2117000	Good game.
2117000	2119000	I am going to drop it to the bomb!
2119000	2121000	But I didn't, because I'm so
2121000	2123000	emotional at this child's game.
2123000	2125000	Wah!
2125000	2127000	Oh, there's two bombs, that's cheeky.
2127000	2129000	The devs did that for a reason.
2129000	2131000	They knew I was going to be greedy
2131000	2133000	and go for the bomba.
2133000	2135000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2136000	2138000	Hello?
2138000	2139000	Okay.
2139000	2141000	Holy crap, I was like, can I even
2141000	2143000	go near that at all?
2144000	2147000	Steady, easy, easy.
2147000	2149000	Take it easy.
2149000	2151000	Steady.
2151000	2153000	I'd say someone steady wins the race, but sometimes
2153000	2155000	sometimes you're going to just send it
2155000	2157000	and get out of here.
2157000	2159000	Oh my god.
2161000	2163000	Oh, this is so good.
2163000	2165000	Who suggested this game?
2165000	2167000	Congrats on you if you suggested it.
2167000	2169000	Just kidding, I picked it, because it's a child's
2169000	2171000	game.
2171000	2173000	Okay.
2173000	2175000	The boss fight!
2175000	2177000	Oh no!
2177000	2179000	Tiny Tiger.
2179000	2181000	Oh no.
2181000	2183000	Am I going to get perished by a boss?
2183000	2185000	Crash.
2185000	2187000	Stole the pretty crystals.
2189000	2191000	Tiny, take them back.
2191000	2193000	Excalibur Arena.
2197000	2199000	Sometimes here.
2199000	2201000	Oh no.
2201000	2203000	All the music is banging though.
2207000	2209000	Oh no.
2213000	2215000	MonkaS.
2215000	2217000	MonkaS, what'd I do?
2217000	2219000	MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS.
2219000	2221000	Ah!
2221000	2223000	Please leave me alone.
2223000	2225000	Oh my god, he's got J's on like me.
2227000	2229000	Spank!
2229000	2231000	Okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine.
2231000	2233000	One and three, one and three, we follow.
2233000	2235000	What does that mean?
2235000	2237000	What does that mean?
2237000	2239000	There's Tigers!
2241000	2243000	I'm to avoid
2243000	2245000	everything.
2247000	2249000	Uh,
2249000	2251000	what?
2251000	2253000	I'm to avoid all those Tigers?
2253000	2255000	Right, Spank
2255000	2257000	and then Tigers. Right, we can do this.
2257000	2259000	We can do this.
2259000	2261000	Okay, take your time.
2261000	2263000	Uh-huh.
2263000	2265000	Uh-huh.
2265000	2267000	Oh yeah, uh-huh.
2267000	2269000	Oh yeah, uh-huh.
2269000	2271000	Okay, okay, I just got a little call
2271000	2273000	up in the last one.
2273000	2275000	Okay, just keep running.
2275000	2277000	Just keep running, just keep running.
2277000	2279000	Spank!
2279000	2281000	And then we do it all over again.
2281000	2283000	Okay.
2283000	2285000	Okay.
2285000	2287000	Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
2287000	2289000	This is so much faster than the second phase.
2289000	2291000	But that's okay!
2293000	2295000	Okay.
2295000	2297000	Okay, okay, just keep running.
2297000	2299000	Just keep running around. He'll come to me.
2299000	2301000	We did it, we're doing it, we're doing it,
2301000	2303000	we're doing it, we're doing it.
2303000	2305000	Spank!
2305000	2307000	Oh, we did it! Oh, what did we get?
2307000	2309000	What is this?
2309000	2311000	Oh, that's a boo!
2311000	2313000	Tomato, tomato, boo!
2313000	2315000	Beat him while he's down, beat him while he's down!
2315000	2317000	Ah!
2317000	2319000	Take this.
2319000	2321000	Oh, okay, what is this?
2323000	2325000	Supercharged Body Slam.
2325000	2327000	For a more professional belly flop, press A
2327000	2329000	and B
2329000	2331000	to the top of the jump.
2333000	2335000	Please!
2335000	2337000	I love this so much!
2337000	2339000	Oh, that's so good, I love it!
2339000	2341000	Momay Domination.
2341000	2343000	Dang straight.
2343000	2345000	Dang straight!
2345000	2347000	Well done, children.
2347000	2349000	By defeating Tiny,
2349000	2351000	you have unlocked the gate to the next time travel area.
2351000	2353000	Go back to the center
2353000	2355000	of this time, Trister,
2355000	2357000	and save your progress if you wish.
2357000	2359000	From there, you will see
2359000	2361000	that the gate to the second time travel area
2361000	2363000	is now open.
2363000	2365000	Okay!
2365000	2367000	Thank you!
2367000	2369000	Okay.
2369000	2371000	Okay, so I've unlocked everything in this one.
2371000	2373000	In the castle segment.
2373000	2375000	How do I save the game?
2375000	2377000	Left trigger, save.
2377000	2379000	Uh, sure.
2379000	2381000	Oh, auto-save is already active.
2381000	2383000	That's fine.
2383000	2385000	Yeah, just save that though.
2385000	2387000	Yeah, okay.
2387000	2389000	Just in case.
2389000	2391000	Um, um, um, um, um.
2391000	2393000	What is this?
2393000	2395000	So we've got Arabia,
2395000	2397000	China,
2397000	2399000	Egypt,
2399000	2401000	the future,
2401000	2403000	South Korea then,
2403000	2405000	for the future.
2405000	2407000	Tiny Spiny!
2407000	2409000	I would just like to formally say that I,
2409000	2411000	Tiny Spiny,
2411000	2413000	am not associated with Tiny Tiny in any way,
2413000	2415000	and do not endorse his actions.
2415000	2417000	No.
2417000	2419000	It's going so good!
2419000	2421000	I love it!
2421000	2423000	Wow, Bejinga!
2423000	2425000	Thank you for the five gifted memberships.
2425000	2427000	Congrats to those who caught it with your face.
2427000	2429000	It means you get access to the emotes.
2429000	2431000	I'm going to very quickly grab
2431000	2433000	a can of cola.
2433000	2435000	I'll be literally in those seconds,
2435000	2437000	because I couldn't finish my tea, so
2437000	2439000	I'll just get cola.
2439000	2441000	Surely the caffeine will wake me up.
2441000	2443000	Sure.
2447000	2455000	My question
2455000	2457000	is,
2457000	2459000	surely not all commissions are that short,
2459000	2461000	because there's only five locations,
2461000	2463000	and if there's only five locations,
2463000	2465000	I don't,
2465000	2467000	I think they were going to be finished with
2467000	2469000	gaming two hours and,
2469000	2471000	and redirect him into Sheevy,
2471000	2473000	because there's no way.
2473000	2475000	Thank you for the gifted membership,
2475000	2477000	Bejinga, and thank you for
2477000	2479000	the tip,
2479000	2481000	TinySpainE.
2481000	2483000	They're short, but you'll die a lot.
2483000	2485000	What happens if I get zero lives?
2485000	2487000	Like, I genuinely lose?
2487000	2489000	This is called
2489000	2491000	G-Wiz
2491000	2493000	and
2493000	2495000	Why? Why must you continue to be
2495000	2497000	a thorn in our sight?
2497000	2499000	Who? What?
2499000	2501000	Where was I?
2501000	2503000	Oh, Tiny was a good
2503000	2505000	fellow.
2505000	2507000	He hated everyone and everything,
2507000	2509000	but a good heart,
2509000	2511000	nonetheless.
2511000	2513000	Please be more reasonable with my minions
2513000	2515000	next time.
2515000	2517000	It deletes your save file?
2517000	2519000	Am I being trolled right now,
2519000	2521000	or do I genuinely lose all progress?
2521000	2523000	Because this is an old game,
2523000	2525000	and that's exactly what old games did.
2525000	2527000	They make you lose your, well,
2527000	2529000	go back to the farm!
2529000	2531000	Go back to the farm!
2531000	2533000	Back to the farm!
2533000	2535000	Oh!
2535000	2537000	Belly Float!
2539000	2541000	Okay.
2541000	2543000	Wow!
2545000	2547000	Oh!
2547000	2549000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
2549000	2551000	We know...
2551000	2553000	the way I absolutely decimated that
2553000	2555000	poor man.
2557000	2559000	It's not that old. You just lose your score
2559000	2561000	and start from your latest level.
2561000	2563000	Oh!
2563000	2565000	A game over. The player is given the option
2565000	2567000	to either restart the game from the beginning of the level,
2567000	2569000	checkpoint not counted,
2569000	2571000	with the standard number of lives, four,
2571000	2573000	or to quit to the title screen.
2573000	2575000	Okay.
2575000	2577000	So I don't lose all my Puegue.
2577000	2579000	That's good, because if I lost all my progress,
2579000	2581000	we're actually going to play
2581000	2583000	a game called Conquer's Bad Fur Day,
2583000	2585000	but Conquer's Bad Fur Day
2585000	2587000	is so old that
2587000	2589000	you... Oh my god, I like got a trickshot there.
2591000	2593000	It's so old that you lose your progress
2593000	2595000	if you
2595000	2597000	mess up.
2599000	2601000	So I'm going to try and win Conquer's Bad Fur Day,
2601000	2603000	but I actually have terrible news.
2603000	2605000	I don't know if I can win it.
2605000	2607000	Go back on the farm! Both of you!
2609000	2611000	You've been getting so distracted playing...
2611000	2613000	Oh.
2613000	2615000	Go away.
2615000	2617000	Ah, not me!
2617000	2619000	I don't like meages, go away.
2619000	2621000	Chicken!
2621000	2623000	Go! Checkpoint!
2627000	2629000	Ah, this game is so good.
2631000	2633000	It doesn't even... How do you not blow up that nature?
2633000	2635000	As if it's not right next to you.
2635000	2637000	Oh my god, Crash!
2645000	2647000	Oh my shoes!
2647000	2649000	No!
2649000	2651000	I got too excited.
2651000	2653000	I need to unlock double jump right now.
2653000	2655000	I'm so bad.
2655000	2657000	Let's go.
2657000	2659000	Let's go.
2659000	2661000	Let's go.
2661000	2663000	Let's go.
2663000	2665000	I'm so bad.
2665000	2667000	Literally, it has like infinite health.
2667000	2669000	Enemies can't touch me.
2669000	2671000	What defeats me? A gap in the ground.
2671000	2673000	Okay, I see how it is.
2675000	2677000	Ah!
2677000	2679000	Bleeding heart was coming right at me.
2679000	2681000	What?
2681000	2683000	Oh no, not me! Oh, I don't like meages.
2687000	2689000	Big jump! Great, checkpoint.
2689000	2691000	Is there going to be like an enemy behind this?
2691000	2693000	I feel like this is too...
2693000	2695000	No, there isn't. Okay, I'm surprised.
2695000	2697000	Wow!
2697000	2699000	Oh, I missed.
2699000	2701000	Bonus time!
2701000	2703000	Oh, that frog just...
2703000	2705000	did it's self in.
2705000	2707000	I don't know if you saw that.
2707000	2709000	He's that I've had enough.
2709000	2711000	Only Stronik is doing well.
2717000	2719000	Actually Crash and Conquer are both
2719000	2721000	Ginger.
2721000	2723000	What do you have for that?
2723000	2725000	Thank you anonymous for the tip.
2725000	2727000	I appreciate it.
2727000	2729000	Yeah, Conquer is Bad Friday.
2729000	2731000	I have no idea why my dad let me play that game.
2731000	2733000	I know that I think about it because it's absolutely outrageous.
2733000	2735000	Oh wait, I can't really fucking know.
2735000	2737000	Oh my god, I like the jumpy ones.
2741000	2743000	Conquer is Bad Friday was far too inappropriate.
2743000	2745000	Oh, it's a timer!
2745000	2747000	It's a timer!
2747000	2749000	It's a timer!
2749000	2751000	It's a timer.
2751000	2753000	I don't like timer stuff, sorry.
2753000	2755000	Oh wait, no!
2755000	2757000	I missed the box back there!
2757000	2759000	Let me go down, go down!
2759000	2761000	I missed the box!
2761000	2763000	Let me go back!
2763000	2765000	I missed that!
2769000	2771000	Farm, no.
2773000	2775000	Oh, there's two of them now.
2775000	2777000	Farm!
2777000	2779000	To the farm!
2779000	2781000	You will be a slave on it.
2783000	2785000	And you will do all the bidding.
2785000	2787000	And then the refling is going to have a day off because you're the bad guy.
2787000	2789000	Farm, no.
2793000	2795000	Eh?
2795000	2797000	What did that do?
2799000	2801000	No, it was on the bonus level!
2801000	2803000	I'm a stinky stinkerton!
2803000	2805000	I asked the game to put me go back,
2805000	2807000	but it never put me back.
2811000	2813000	I'm eating my blueberry muffin
2813000	2815000	because I need to eat.
2815000	2817000	What's in the box?
2817000	2819000	Disappointment!
2819000	2821000	Because I can't go back.
2821000	2823000	I want to go back!
2823000	2825000	I want to go back!
2825000	2827000	Okay, let me eat my muffin.
2827000	2829000	Classic 5am
2829000	2831000	Physicers, honestly.
2835000	2837000	This OST is bangin'.
2837000	2839000	I didn't realise how good Crash Bandicoot was.
2839000	2841000	For the OST, I didn't remember any of it.
2849000	2851000	Have you talked to Coco in the hub?
2851000	2853000	I don't really search for that stuff when I'm on the hub.
2853000	2855000	I'm more of an overwatch searcher.
2857000	2859000	That was terrible.
2859000	2861000	Interact, Ray Bumper.
2861000	2863000	Hi!
2863000	2865000	Do you want her to join your adventure?
2865000	2867000	I can go be Coco?
2869000	2871000	Oh, that's going to confuse me.
2871000	2873000	Sorry, Coco, you're going to have to go away.
2875000	2877000	Ah! Wait, I get to play as a girl?
2877000	2879000	Ooh!
2879000	2881000	A girl gamer.
2883000	2885000	She's just like me.
2885000	2887000	I want to be Coco because I'm a girl.
2889000	2891000	Let me finish my muffin.
2891000	2893000	It's like a little baby blueberry muffin.
2901000	2903000	Ah!
2907000	2909000	I cannot wait to get 3D models
2909000	2911000	because you will see how much I move around
2911000	2913000	and articulate with my hands
2913000	2915000	and all of that.
2915000	2917000	Boy! Thank you for the gifted member.
2917000	2919000	And E-boss.
2919000	2921000	Thank you for becoming on the membership tier.
2921000	2923000	Membership streams start next week.
2923000	2925000	So after buckshot roulette
2925000	2927000	or probably at the start of buckshot roulette stream
2927000	2929000	I will reveal to you my humble schedule
2929000	2931000	for a stream that week.
2935000	2937000	Oh yeah, you successfully avoided
2937000	2939000	the membership again.
2939000	2941000	Can't wait for Strony to flip us off in 3.
2941000	2943000	I saw someone
2943000	2945000	3D model have physics
2945000	2947000	around their buttocks area
2947000	2949000	and I'm like, I need that ASAP.
2955000	2957000	Sorry, I've almost finished my muffin.
2959000	2961000	Oh my god.
2961000	2963000	These games have such charm.
2963000	2965000	Like when your character is AFK
2965000	2967000	they do like a little idle thing.
2967000	2969000	Like it's... oh!
2969000	2971000	Oh, we've got a phone call. Hold on, who's this?
2971000	2973000	I see, what's going on?
2973000	2975000	Alright, bye.
2975000	2977000	She hardly even spoke to him.
2977000	2979000	Right, are we on 7?
2981000	2983000	Hang them high.
2987000	2989000	Literally, there's like so much detail.
2989000	2991000	Whoa, what's this?
2991000	2993000	Oh my god.
2993000	2995000	Who knows that Aladdin soundtrack?
2995000	2997000	Prince Ali
3001000	3003000	Whoa, what am I supposed to do with that?
3003000	3005000	Am I supposed to spank him when he looks away?
3009000	3011000	That's what you get.
3011000	3013000	Thank you again, boy.
3013000	3015000	Boy for the 5 gifted members.
3015000	3017000	Big congrats to those who caught it.
3017000	3019000	Whoa, what is that?
3019000	3021000	What is that?
3021000	3023000	What the fuck is that?
3025000	3027000	What the fuck? What is he doing?
3029000	3031000	Does he just block the wave?
3031000	3033000	Okay, oh my god.
3033000	3035000	I'm sorry, but that's so menacing.
3035000	3037000	When something follows your movement pattern
3037000	3039000	that is so menacing.
3039000	3041000	I did not enjoy that.
3041000	3043000	Don't do that again.
3043000	3045000	Don't ever spawn in an enemy like that again game
3045000	3047000	because it's so like scary.
3047000	3049000	Hold on, I'm having a cola hydration check.
3049000	3051000	What the fuck?
3055000	3057000	No, no, Coco, stop getting phone calls.
3057000	3059000	God, you're one busy girl.
3059000	3061000	Oh, wait, hold on.
3061000	3063000	Wait, jump and then hit.
3063000	3065000	Yeah.
3065000	3067000	And then...
3067000	3069000	Whoa, oh my god.
3069000	3071000	I feel like games like this
3071000	3073000	used to be so creative, honestly.
3073000	3075000	Right, jump down, check point.
3075000	3077000	What was that?
3078000	3080000	Dab.
3080000	3082000	Oh, that was so mean.
3082000	3084000	He had the delivery to do,
3084000	3086000	and I just ruined his delivery.
3086000	3088000	Go away. You scare me.
3089000	3092000	Menacing man on a carpet.
3092000	3094000	Wow.
3095000	3097000	Oh my god, there's so much.
3097000	3099000	Whoa, oh, there's a monkey again.
3099000	3101000	That's okay.
3101000	3103000	Oh, I hurt myself.
3103000	3105000	But when you hurt yourself,
3105000	3107000	you'll also hurt the enemy.
3107000	3109000	Okay, I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning.
3109000	3111000	Wow, I can't see.
3111000	3113000	Check point, I can't see now.
3115000	3117000	I am a monkey.
3117000	3119000	Oh, wait, I didn't realize I could do that.
3121000	3123000	Go away, go away, man on the carpet.
3123000	3125000	Go away.
3125000	3127000	You scare me.
3131000	3133000	I don't really want scorpions on the fan,
3133000	3135000	so I don't think we'll send them.
3135000	3137000	Oh, there's a bonus level down here.
3137000	3139000	Look, I see it, I see it, I see it.
3139000	3141000	Take us to the bonus level.
3143000	3145000	You missed some boxes.
3145000	3147000	I didn't realize I could attack while I was hanging up.
3147000	3149000	Oh, I missed completely.
3149000	3151000	Oh no, I got drabated.
3151000	3153000	I'm supposed to go up here.
3155000	3157000	Wait, I'd rather go for a life.
3157000	3159000	I was speeding up.
3159000	3161000	Oh, wait, I can't get them.
3161000	3163000	Whoa, that was lucky.
3169000	3171000	Wait, what?
3171000	3173000	How am I supposed to get that one down there?
3175000	3177000	Oh, butt bouncing adventures!
3177000	3179000	Pre-DLC.
3179000	3181000	How am I supposed to get down there?
3181000	3183000	Was that supposed to do something?
3183000	3185000	I don't know, chief.
3185000	3187000	I didn't get it.
3187000	3189000	TNT, am I supposed to blow it up?
3189000	3191000	I don't know.
3193000	3195000	Literally, we're doing butt bouncing adventures
3195000	3197000	for Elden Ring even now.
3197000	3199000	So, for the Elden Ring DLC.
3199000	3201000	Wow.
3203000	3205000	Those are so good.
3205000	3207000	Oh, we're at 14 lives as well.
3207000	3209000	That's fantastic.
3209000	3211000	I can't wait to make 14 mistakes.
3211000	3213000	Oh!
3213000	3215000	He bumped me away!
3215000	3217000	Checkpoint!
3221000	3223000	What am I supposed to do here?
3223000	3225000	That?
3225000	3227000	Ow!
3227000	3229000	I couldn't get over it.
3231000	3233000	See you lanky tall bastards!
3233000	3235000	Honestly.
3235000	3237000	How do I do the bottom one?
3237000	3239000	Right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
3239000	3241000	How do I do the bottom ones?
3241000	3243000	Okay.
3243000	3245000	That makes sense.
3245000	3247000	Oh!
3247000	3249000	You know what?
3249000	3251000	Give me double jump already.
3251000	3253000	Just give me double jump.
3253000	3255000	This is getting outrageous.
3255000	3257000	Just give me double jump.
3257000	3259000	Right, you look ready.
3259000	3261000	Parish to the Fires of Gondor.
3261000	3263000	Wait, no, that's not it.
3263000	3265000	Cast it into the Fires of Gondor.
3265000	3267000	No, that's not right.
3267000	3269000	See you and your wee weaving baskets!
3269000	3271000	He almost pushed me off the map!
3271000	3273000	Don't bump me!
3273000	3275000	What did that do?
3275000	3277000	Oh!
3277000	3279000	Wait, what did that do?
3279000	3281000	Something just happened.
3281000	3283000	I don't know what.
3285000	3287000	Well, get me out of this level.
3287000	3289000	I got too confused.
3289000	3291000	I'm not well enough for that.
3291000	3293000	The Fires of Gondor.
3293000	3295000	I don't know why I said that.
3295000	3297000	I'm doing too many things at once.
3297000	3299000	This is really hard on my brain.
3299000	3301000	I didn't like that one.
3301000	3303000	That mission was scary.
3303000	3305000	The wee...
3305000	3307000	Hog Raid?
3307000	3309000	How creative!
3309000	3311000	I'm sore!
3311000	3313000	Oh my god, it really said no women are allowed to drive.
3313000	3315000	Wow, this game did not age well.
3317000	3319000	That's terrible.
3319000	3321000	I shouldn't have said that.
3321000	3323000	Oh, wait.
3323000	3325000	What?
3325000	3327000	Okay.
3327000	3329000	Right.
3329000	3331000	Am I just to get through the level
3331000	3333000	without getting hurt?
3333000	3335000	I think I can do that.
3335000	3337000	Whee!
3337000	3339000	Oopsies.
3339000	3341000	Oh no, the pole!
3341000	3343000	It's a polis, lads.
3343000	3345000	It's a polis. Pause.
3345000	3347000	Right, who's got a bag on them?
3347000	3349000	I don't want to touch them.
3351000	3353000	Right, we're doing a jump kick.
3353000	3355000	Whee!
3355000	3357000	Oh wait, I'm fourth place.
3357000	3359000	I'm to beat these people?
3359000	3361000	Oh, oh no.
3361000	3363000	Oh no, this can't be.
3363000	3365000	I didn't realize I was actually racing.
3365000	3367000	I was just having fun driving, to be honest.
3367000	3369000	I just think this is a cool map.
3369000	3371000	Oh no.
3371000	3373000	I'm supposed to win.
3373000	3375000	Ah!
3375000	3377000	Okay, hold on.
3377000	3379000	Oh no, I lost!
3379000	3381000	No, wait.
3381000	3383000	Oh no, why did I just break
3383000	3385000	to let that guy go third?
3385000	3387000	Wait, I won though.
3387000	3389000	Oh no, I didn't win!
3389000	3391000	Oh no!
3391000	3393000	I have to actually win.
3393000	3395000	I was just having fun driving, not going to lie.
3395000	3397000	I was like, oh, this is actually a really
3397000	3399000	fun wee game.
3399000	3401000	Oops.
3401000	3403000	Is there like a boost button?
3403000	3405000	Or is it literally just send it?
3407000	3409000	Okay, I'm just going for it.
3409000	3411000	I don't know if there's a sender.
3411000	3413000	I think I maybe have to hit all the green boost.
3413000	3415000	And it like guarantees you to go ahead
3415000	3417000	of, whoa!
3417000	3419000	Crash, what are you doing?
3419000	3421000	The steering crash!
3421000	3423000	Oh my god, there is like, no steering!
3423000	3425000	Ah!
3425000	3427000	Oh wait, I don't die if I hit them?
3427000	3429000	Okay.
3429000	3431000	Right, I'm third place.
3431000	3433000	I just need to hit all the green that comes up.
3433000	3435000	Uh...
3435000	3437000	Right.
3437000	3439000	All right, hold on.
3439000	3441000	I'm looking for the green to get me ahead.
3441000	3443000	Crash, please stop skittin',
3443000	3445000	skittin' a boot.
3445000	3447000	Okay, there's a green there.
3447000	3449000	Oh!
3449000	3451000	Get in my way!
3451000	3453000	Your ball back!
3453000	3455000	No!
3455000	3457000	No!
3457000	3459000	Right, again, again, again, again, again.
3459000	3461000	He was in my way!
3461000	3463000	Right, try again. Go again, Crash.
3465000	3467000	Try again.
3467000	3469000	He was in my way on the greenery.
3469000	3471000	The green pads are the boost, yeah.
3473000	3475000	Right, let's freakin' try that again.
3479000	3481000	I feel like when I played this as a child,
3481000	3483000	if I even got this far,
3483000	3485000	I probably would be crying right now.
3485000	3487000	You know how like kids cry in frustration
3487000	3489000	when they can't win?
3489000	3491000	I feel like...
3491000	3493000	I'd be greeting right now.
3493000	3495000	Because I'm so bad at the game.
3497000	3499000	Would you laugh at
3499000	3501000	a young, strongy crying right now?
3501000	3503000	Crying are we eyes out.
3507000	3509000	Right, I'm third place.
3509000	3511000	There should be like
3511000	3513000	three green speed-ups ahead.
3513000	3515000	I'm not going to break the boxes.
3515000	3517000	I'm wondering if that slows me down a bit.
3519000	3521000	Go ahead.
3521000	3523000	So that's me second place.
3523000	3525000	Okay.
3525000	3527000	Crash, you're going to have to put... Crash!
3527000	3529000	No, wait, what must the...
3529000	3531000	It's Bioball here!
3531000	3533000	It's Bioball here!
3533000	3535000	Ladies and gentlemen, I got first place!
3537000	3539000	Oh my god!
3539000	3541000	We did it!
3541000	3543000	We did it!
3543000	3545000	We are the champions.
3545000	3547000	There's no time
3547000	3549000	for loses
3549000	3551000	because we
3551000	3553000	are the champions
3553000	3555000	of the world.
3555000	3557000	It's Tim Tame.
3557000	3559000	Forget Tim Reader.
3573000	3575000	Oh no, not the Aussies.
3575000	3577000	Anything but the Australians.
3577000	3579000	No, save us!
3579000	3581000	Oh.
3581000	3583000	Are you squidding me right now?
3583000	3585000	Jack, thank you for the tip. Well done, strongy.
3585000	3587000	Purple burglar alert.
3587000	3589000	I don't know, maybe not the farm.
3589000	3591000	Maybe go with the animal sanctuary rescue.
3591000	3593000	Thank you for the tip, Jack.
3595000	3597000	Oh my god, we're in Tim Tame's tomb.
3599000	3601000	Oh, look at the detail on the walls.
3601000	3603000	I'm sorry, but
3603000	3605000	they don't
3605000	3607000	make games like they used to.
3607000	3609000	Look at, wow, what is that?
3609000	3611000	A Crocodonkey.
3611000	3613000	Right, go away.
3613000	3615000	It got my butthole!
3615000	3617000	I didn't even get a checkpoint.
3617000	3619000	That's how
3619000	3621000	not far into the game I was.
3621000	3623000	It got my butthole.
3625000	3627000	I'm so bad.
3627000	3629000	Right, big jump.
3629000	3631000	And then up the stairs.
3631000	3633000	And then jump.
3633000	3635000	Okay, let's find that thing.
3635000	3637000	That was just bad timing.
3637000	3639000	Whoa!
3639000	3641000	It's oil!
3641000	3643000	I'm really scared. Oh my god, it's made from Overwatch.
3643000	3645000	I can't believe they based this game on made from Overwatch.
3645000	3647000	Whoa!
3649000	3651000	Oh my god!
3651000	3653000	She's so cute when she skates.
3653000	3655000	I love Coco.
3655000	3657000	Boom, boom, boom.
3657000	3659000	Look at the detail on the walls.
3661000	3663000	Uh...
3663000	3665000	Yeah, I saw that. I saw that.
3665000	3667000	I had video game knowledge to know something wasn't right there.
3667000	3669000	Brian!
3669000	3671000	Brian, but no message.
3671000	3673000	Thank you for the tip.
3673000	3675000	Brian, but no message.
3675000	3677000	Brian!
3677000	3679000	Don't tell America there's oil there.
3679000	3681000	We're getting invaded.
3681000	3683000	Wait, there's TNT everywhere.
3683000	3685000	Oh, this is not going to go well for me.
3685000	3687000	Get me the heck out of here.
3687000	3689000	I'm not even just...
3689000	3691000	Does it blow off?
3691000	3693000	Okay, it just blows up TNT in the vicinity.
3693000	3695000	Okay, that's fine.
3695000	3697000	Oh no, I'm scared.
3697000	3699000	I'm hiding.
3699000	3701000	Something just went flying.
3701000	3703000	I don't know what, but...
3705000	3707000	Thank you for the tip, Brian.
3707000	3709000	Okay.
3709000	3711000	Yeah, I knew there was something up there,
3711000	3713000	but I didn't want to jump on it
3713000	3715000	because I got scared.
3715000	3717000	Oh wait, I could have barely flopped on the other side of the map.
3717000	3719000	Oops.
3719000	3721000	I can't believe it.
3721000	3723000	I'm not an MLG gamer.
3723000	3725000	What's this?
3725000	3727000	Oh, it's a time.
3727000	3729000	Oh my god, it's the Anka symbol.
3729000	3731000	Is that a Gen 2 reference?
3735000	3737000	Eh? I need to jump over this?
3739000	3741000	Okay, I can do that.
3741000	3743000	See you, yo, bam.
3743000	3745000	Great.
3745000	3747000	Oh no.
3747000	3749000	Oh, I got...
3749000	3751000	I heard the...
3751000	3753000	What did you hear?
3753000	3755000	Am I a vampire?
3755000	3757000	Are you squiddling here?
3757000	3759000	Ah!
3759000	3761000	Ah.
3761000	3763000	That's a trick.
3765000	3767000	The Dinger, thank you for the five.
3767000	3769000	You know what?
3769000	3771000	I actually was in trade.
3771000	3773000	I can't do it this month or maybe next month.
3773000	3775000	However, I am so down to do...
3775000	3777000	like...
3777000	3779000	what?
3779000	3781000	I am so down to do
3781000	3783000	showing off game dev type.
3783000	3785000	How the heck did I get over there?
3785000	3787000	I cannot make that jump. I know that for a fact.
3787000	3789000	I'm so down to do that
3789000	3791000	to give game devs that are smaller
3791000	3793000	a bigger chance type thing.
3793000	3795000	And we write a little review.
3795000	3797000	We write a little review at the end.
3797000	3799000	Oh no.
3799000	3801000	Oh no, this can't be.
3803000	3805000	Look at all the paint.
3805000	3807000	Look at the detail.
3807000	3809000	They're implying that they're painting the murals right now.
3809000	3811000	Look!
3811000	3813000	It's so fun and cute.
3813000	3815000	Thank you again for the five by Dinger.
3815000	3817000	How do I do this?
3817000	3819000	Is it a timer?
3819000	3821000	I don't know.
3821000	3823000	Okay, it's a timer.
3823000	3825000	Do not be distracted from the fact that it's a timer.
3825000	3827000	As beautiful as the game's...
3827000	3829000	The game's
3829000	3831000	background
3831000	3833000	storytelling is the thingy.
3833000	3835000	It is a timer, so do not be fooled.
3835000	3837000	Wait until it gets close to you, okay?
3837000	3839000	Wait until it gets close to you.
3839000	3841000	Oh!
3841000	3843000	Right, hold on, hold on, hold on.
3845000	3847000	Child's game absolutely
3847000	3849000	decimating me.
3849000	3851000	Oh my god.
3851000	3853000	Growing women beaten to pulp
3853000	3855000	via child's game.
3855000	3857000	Once it opens, then just go straight for it.
3857000	3859000	Right.
3859000	3861000	I'll wait until that comes back.
3861000	3863000	Because, yeah.
3863000	3865000	Unless Coco can just stand on this.
3865000	3867000	Okay, yeah.
3867000	3869000	Okay, we're safe, we're safe.
3869000	3871000	We're safe.
3871000	3873000	Wait!
3873000	3875000	Wait, how am I supposed to get around that?
3875000	3877000	Oh wait, no!
3877000	3879000	There's a life back there!
3879000	3881000	Okay, that's what I need.
3881000	3883000	Yes.
3883000	3885000	That sounded terrible.
3885000	3887000	I said I need a lifter.
3887000	3889000	Right, we've got a checkpoint.
3889000	3891000	Right, go!
3891000	3893000	Uh-huh.
3893000	3895000	Oh no!
3895000	3897000	Coco!
3897000	3899000	Coco!
3899000	3901000	Right, no wonder there's a freaking checkpoint there.
3901000	3903000	Coco, what was that abysmal attempt?
3903000	3905000	You know exactly what you were doing, hen.
3907000	3909000	You, Karrish.
3909000	3911000	Whoa.
3911000	3913000	Flamethrower's a bit dramatic.
3913000	3915000	This is a child's game.
3915000	3917000	Wow!
3919000	3921000	I'm scared!
3923000	3925000	Oh Coco!
3925000	3927000	I'm scared.
3927000	3929000	Oh, get me off this level.
3929000	3931000	I hate platforming like that.
3931000	3933000	Oh, get me off, get me off, get me off.
3933000	3935000	Oh, another portal we go.
3935000	3937000	Safety, safety.
3941000	3943000	Only time's strong to get smashed.
3943000	3947000	Reflens, are you not coming to the convention?
3947000	3949000	Hold on a minute.
3949000	3951000	Hold on, this is news to me.
3951000	3953000	Right, no, I played that one.
3953000	3955000	And I just did that one, didn't I?
3955000	3957000	Okay.
3957000	3959000	So we're gonna play
3959000	3961000	Midnight Run.
3961000	3963000	Okay, Midnight Run.
3965000	3967000	Midnight Run.
3967000	3969000	What's my tiger called?
3969000	3971000	I'm sure my tiger has a name.
3971000	3973000	Oh my God!
3973000	3975000	He's so cute!
3975000	3977000	I can't handle it.
3977000	3979000	Tiger confirmed for Jin too.
3979000	3981000	Oh my God!
3981000	3983000	You're so cute!
3983000	3985000	Oh my God, jump, jump high.
3985000	3987000	Oh, there's a lot of enemies up here.
3997000	3999000	Oh, jump!
3999000	4001000	Oh, check mark.
4011000	4013000	And jump.
4013000	4015000	Jump food.
4017000	4021000	Oh, I love this freaking tiger so much.
4021000	4024000	Oh my God, why am I doing so much better on later levels
4024000	4026000	than I am on the early level?
4027000	4029000	Oh my God!
4029000	4031000	You're cheatsy doodle!
4031000	4032000	Did you see that?
4032000	4034000	Oh my God, I cheatsy doodle!
4036000	4038000	Uh, uh, uh, uh.
4038000	4039000	Right, checkpoint, checkpoint.
4039000	4040000	Jump.
4045000	4046000	I saw that.
4046000	4048000	I saw what the game was trying to do.
4048000	4050000	I'm tryharding on this level.
4050000	4051000	I don't care.
4051000	4053000	I love it.
4053000	4055000	And I love me tiger.
4056000	4058000	Love me cocoa.
4058000	4060000	Love me China wall.
4060000	4061000	Simplest.
4061000	4063000	Oh my God!
4063000	4065000	This freaking best level ever!
4065000	4067000	I know.
4067000	4069000	Jump, jump, sled, sled.
4069000	4070000	I love the tiger.
4070000	4072000	Jin won, you won for now.
4072000	4073000	It's 100k.
4073000	4075000	What, steady on, steady on.
4075000	4077000	No, I think I'll hold him for a while.
4079000	4081000	Trying to be gaming like a pro?
4081000	4082000	I freaking love!
4082000	4084000	Oh no, we're doing a boss fight.
4084000	4085000	Cola check.
4085000	4086000	Everyone hydrate.
4086000	4088000	We're about to do a boss fight.
4090000	4092000	The tiger's called Pura?
4092000	4096000	Oh my God, Jin to confirm tiger girl called Pura.
4096000	4097000	I'm not even care.
4097000	4099000	Oh, I've just tabbed out.
4099000	4100000	That was a terrible idea.
4100000	4101000	Sorry, I just tabbed out of the game.
4101000	4103000	I got a DM.
4105000	4109000	Okay, I have, I have good news for everyone.
4109000	4112000	I don't, I have good news for everyone.
4112000	4116000	Mercy and Aisy's meme ASMR are going up today.
4116000	4119000	I just got confirmation from the squadron.
4119000	4121000	Dingo Dale.
4121000	4123000	A Dingo Dale.
4123000	4124000	A Dingo Dale.
4124000	4126000	Oh my God, that's such an Aussie name.
4126000	4129000	Oh my God, they said no whammin' fights.
4129000	4130000	Yay!
4130000	4132000	A tiger girl called Pura.
4132000	4135000	Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura.
4135000	4137000	Them crystals are mine.
4141000	4142000	Call me Pura.
4142000	4144000	Oh, it's a...
4144000	4146000	Break out the butter.
4150000	4153000	Uh, uh, what?
4154000	4155000	What is this?
4162000	4164000	Um...
4165000	4166000	Hmm?
4169000	4171000	I don't...
4171000	4173000	I don't understand how he auto-locked me.
4173000	4174000	Oh, he did it again!
4174000	4175000	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
4175000	4176000	Hold on, sorry, sorry.
4176000	4178000	I'm looking, I'm looking where his gun is pointing.
4178000	4180000	Sorry, give me, give me a second.
4180000	4182000	It takes me a second to figure things out for myself.
4182000	4183000	Hold on, hold on.
4183000	4186000	My brain isn't hot wires like the way it's hot wired for you.
4186000	4188000	Right, he's aiming there.
4189000	4190000	Ah!
4190000	4191000	He keeps aiming!
4193000	4194000	Now what?
4195000	4197000	Oh, he keeps going.
4197000	4198000	Oh!
4198000	4199000	Please don't do that.
4199000	4200000	Oh!
4200000	4201000	Please don't do that!
4201000	4203000	I'm trying to hurt him.
4204000	4205000	Okay.
4206000	4207000	Oh.
4210000	4212000	Okay, I just need to do that three times.
4212000	4213000	Okay, okay.
4213000	4217000	I just needed a second to digest what the game is asking me to do.
4217000	4218000	That's all.
4219000	4222000	I just needed a tricky second.
4223000	4225000	Right, if he just keeps all locking,
4225000	4228000	I could probably just keep going like this.
4228000	4230000	Oh, no.
4231000	4232000	Okay.
4233000	4234000	Twat him?
4234000	4235000	Okay, okay.
4235000	4237000	We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.
4239000	4240000	Okay, okay, okay.
4240000	4241000	Last one, boys.
4242000	4244000	I just need to look on the ground.
4244000	4245000	No.
4247000	4250000	Oh no, does he do a variation attack?
4251000	4252000	Oh.
4253000	4255000	Okay, nice and easy.
4256000	4258000	We did it, we did it, we did it.
4258000	4261000	Unless we need to do anything special, I think that's good.
4263000	4265000	Oh my God, he let you win.
4265000	4267000	With a Higgy or then?
4268000	4270000	Yeah, get him, Penguin!
4271000	4272000	Beat his ass, Penguin.
4272000	4274000	We'll do it together.
4274000	4276000	No one will do it.
4276000	4278000	Yeah, beat him up, beat him up.
4278000	4280000	We love penguins in here.
4280000	4282000	Gen 2 penguin confirmed.
4282000	4283000	Double jump.
4283000	4285000	Yes, a jump twice as high.
4285000	4289000	Okay, I can probably replay those other missions if I so desired.
4289000	4290000	No.
4290000	4293000	Oh my God, look at that vertical leap.
4293000	4295000	Look at that vertical leap.
4296000	4299000	Get me in the NBAs right now, NBAs.
4301000	4302000	NBA?
4302000	4303000	NBA.
4303000	4304000	Get me in the NBAs right now.
4304000	4306000	Coco, show us that double jump.
4306000	4308000	Wow, look at that.
4308000	4310000	She's a cheerleader.
4310000	4313000	Oh my God, she's such a cheerleader.
4313000	4315000	Right, we're going to change the turn.
4315000	4316000	Let's go.
4316000	4318000	Right, what are we eating first?
4318000	4320000	Baggies from Dim Sum's.
4320000	4322000	We're doing the Dano Mate.
4323000	4327000	Oh my God, that's such a good name for a TNT dinosaur.
4327000	4328000	Oh my God, Gen 2 confirmed.
4328000	4331000	Sorry, I'm just stealing all my Gen 2 ideas from Crash Bandicoot.
4331000	4333000	I don't mind if I do.
4336000	4339000	A pair of Pate Marsupials.
4339000	4342000	I am Dr. Nefarious Trope.
4342000	4349000	Master of Time and the creator of the very time twister machine you see before you.
4349000	4356000	Uka Uka and Dr. Cortex have sent me to end this little shroud.
4356000	4360000	So you won't be leaving my area with the crystals?
4360000	4362000	I swear it.
4363000	4367000	Wow, this game is so fun.
4367000	4369000	Thank you for watching.
4369000	4371000	No, no, no.
4371000	4373000	Is that what I think it is?
4373000	4376000	Is this going to be a chase sequence?
4381000	4383000	I take it all back.
4386000	4388000	Is this a chase sequence?
4388000	4390000	Oh my God, I can like clear those with ease.
4390000	4393000	What the heck is that?
4393000	4396000	Honestly, honestly.
4396000	4397000	Oh, that's lava.
4397000	4398000	That's not a path.
4398000	4399000	Oh my goodness.
4399000	4403000	My brain literally registered that last second.
4403000	4408000	Oh my God, this looks like a chase sequence map.
4408000	4410000	See it ain't so.
4410000	4413000	I will not go turn the lights off.
4413000	4415000	Carry me home.
4415000	4417000	Oh my God, that fish is so freaky.
4417000	4420000	It's supposed to look like crash, isn't it?
4420000	4422000	I'm not just making that up.
4422000	4423000	Oh, go away.
4423000	4425000	Oh, go away.
4425000	4427000	You're so creepy.
4429000	4430000	Oh, I'm scared.
4430000	4431000	I don't like it.
4431000	4433000	Wait, why are you not possible?
4433000	4435000	That's the second one that's not possible.
4435000	4436000	I wonder why that's not possible.
4436000	4440000	Wow, the grass slowed me down.
4440000	4441000	No.
4441000	4442000	Oh, I stood on its head.
4442000	4443000	Oh, it's like Mario.
4443000	4446000	If you stand on its head, it's gone.
4446000	4448000	It's dead if you stand on it.
4448000	4451000	Wait, what does the egg do?
4451000	4452000	Hello.
4452000	4454000	We kissed the egg and let it germinate.
4454000	4456000	Am I supposed to break it?
4456000	4457000	I really don't want to break it.
4457000	4459000	I feel like I was really mean.
4459000	4460000	I don't want to break the egg.
4460000	4461000	I'm sorry.
4461000	4463000	There's something germinating inside it.
4463000	4466000	We want it to wish it success.
4466000	4471000	Great success in your life.
4471000	4472000	Break the egg.
4472000	4473000	I don't want it.
4473000	4475000	There's something living inside it.
4475000	4476000	If you...
4476000	4478000	Although saying that, you can actually grow chickens
4478000	4481000	without their shell or being cracked open.
4481000	4484000	I don't actually recommend you doing it, but...
4484000	4485000	What?
4485000	4486000	Did you see that?
4486000	4488000	How big that thing was?
4488000	4491000	Go away.
4491000	4493000	No egg breakie.
4493000	4502000	We are nice to nature.
4502000	4504000	Okay, okay, okay.
4504000	4511000	Oh, the music is so good.
4511000	4514000	I love children's games.
4514000	4520000	I love them being relatively easy.
4520000	4522000	Yeah, that's right.
4522000	4523000	I'm smart at that segment.
4523000	4530000	I knew exactly what you were going to ask me.
4530000	4538000	Bonus mission.
4538000	4540000	You got a break here.
4540000	4541000	Break egg.
4541000	4542000	Help it hatch.
4542000	4543000	Oh, I'm to help it hatch?
4543000	4544000	Oh, that's different then.
4544000	4550000	Okay, I'll break the eggs when I see them.
4550000	4551000	Wow.
4551000	4552000	Butt smash.
4552000	4554000	Oh, I missed that one back there.
4554000	4556000	That's okay.
4556000	4559000	Butt smash.
4559000	4560000	Wow.
4560000	4566000	Oh, that's like so many wumper fruit.
4566000	4570000	And a life, which I definitely mean how much I'm...
4570000	4575000	Oh, I can't reach it.
4575000	4576000	I couldn't reach it anyway.
4576000	4578000	Oh, well.
4578000	4580000	Oh, well.
4580000	4581000	Wee.
4581000	4583000	Let's go.
4583000	4586000	We're strong and we weave.
4586000	4587000	You don't get excited.
4587000	4588000	No, I saw it.
4588000	4589000	I saw it.
4589000	4591000	Did you see it too?
4591000	4596000	I saw the Terran and Zoran ring.
4596000	4598000	I have double jump.
4598000	4599000	Okay.
4599000	4600000	Okay.
4600000	4604000	Trust in the double jump.
4604000	4605000	Okay.
4605000	4609000	Wow, you're going so fast.
4609000	4612000	I have double jump and I still feel that jump.
4612000	4613000	Wow.
4613000	4617000	Oh, cool, cool.
4617000	4620000	This camera angle isn't helping, darling.
4620000	4625000	Yes, a bear camera angle, please.
4625000	4628000	Oh, please give us a bear camera angle.
4628000	4629000	Oh, get me out of here.
4629000	4631000	Oh, my God.
4631000	4636000	How are you supposed to know what's coming up?
4636000	4639000	How are you supposed to know?
4639000	4641000	No more dino missions, please.
4641000	4642000	My heart can't take it.
4642000	4644000	I'm getting so stressed out.
4645000	4648000	Deep trouble.
4648000	4652000	Okay, my time.
4652000	4655000	We still call that a skill issue.
4655000	4656000	Okay.
4656000	4657000	Okay, you're done.
4657000	4658000	Back to the...
4658000	4659000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4659000	4660000	You need reaction time.
4660000	4662000	I don't have reaction time, though.
4662000	4663000	What?
4663000	4664000	Can I go up?
4664000	4665000	No, sorry.
4665000	4671000	The game almost looked like I could go up.
4671000	4673000	Okay, let's hope I don't mess this up.
4674000	4676000	Too much.
4676000	4679000	I'm just going to spam.
4679000	4680000	Oh, my God.
4680000	4681000	Yes, spamming.
4681000	4683000	Why did you not get hit?
4683000	4685000	Well, I'll leave you alive.
4685000	4687000	But tell your family.
4687000	4690000	I almost got electric shock.
4690000	4693000	Oh, my God.
4693000	4696000	Actually, I'm so sorry if you get sick of that meme.
4696000	4699000	It's probably the funniest thing I enjoy right now.
4699000	4701000	It's just full going, oh, my God.
4701000	4703000	This character confirmed.
4703000	4704000	I don't know.
4704000	4706000	I just find it really funny.
4706000	4709000	Okay, I can beat up sharks underwater.
4709000	4712000	Oh, my God.
4712000	4714000	I'm stuck in a vortex.
4714000	4717000	Oh, my God.
4717000	4719000	Okay, it's fine.
4719000	4720000	We made it.
4720000	4721000	We made it.
4721000	4725000	Wow.
4725000	4730000	I like the tissues are just hanging out in this one winter thing.
4731000	4736000	Oh, God, that was two for one.
4736000	4741000	Oh, my God.
4741000	4743000	Crash Bandicoot really said inflation.
4743000	4745000	Inflation confirmed for gender.
4745000	4747000	I'm so sorry.
4747000	4748000	Oh, I did it twice.
4748000	4749000	Oh, my God.
4749000	4750000	I'm so sorry.
4750000	4752000	Please excuse me by all means.
4752000	4753000	Right.
4753000	4754000	Let's not do that again.
4754000	4755000	Spin.
4755000	4756000	Right.
4756000	4757000	There.
4757000	4758000	Jeez.
4758000	4759000	Why was that so hard?
4759000	4764000	Crystal does, but does it like a locker bonus thing for me later?
4764000	4767000	I'm just using my damage to get out.
4767000	4768000	Whoa.
4768000	4771000	I didn't even see that.
4771000	4777000	Literally spinning damage helps you move so much faster.
4777000	4778000	Inflation.
4778000	4781000	Wow.
4781000	4806000	I don't have a mask right now, so this is extra scary.
4806000	4807000	Right.
4807000	4812000	I didn't know you died in the vortex.
4812000	4813000	Oh, no.
4813000	4815000	How far back am I?
4815000	4818000	I lost me boat a wee bit ago.
4818000	4819000	I'm just spamming.
4819000	4822000	Am I going crazy?
4822000	4823000	No.
4823000	4824000	Oh, my God.
4824000	4828000	We're going to the rapture bio shot confirmed.
4828000	4829000	Oh, wait.
4829000	4832000	I can just destroy the natural boxes when I'm like this.
4832000	4833000	That's fine.
4833000	4835000	Oh, no.
4835000	4838000	Why am I so bad at timing?
4838000	4839000	I made it.
4839000	4840000	I made it.
4840000	4841000	I made it.
4841000	4842000	Oh, right.
4842000	4843000	Okay.
4843000	4845000	I literally perished right before the end of that level.
4845000	4848000	You need the purple crystals to unlock the boss.
4848000	4849000	Okay.
4849000	4850000	Bioshock.
4850000	4851000	I know.
4851000	4852000	Literally.
4852000	4853000	I'm sorry.
4853000	4856000	It's my favorite joke right now because I have had messages like that that have been
4856000	4858000	like, you said this in one stream.
4858000	4859000	Does that mean?
4859000	4860000	Is this the?
4860000	4861000	Oh, my God.
4861000	4862000	Wait.
4862000	4863000	Can the girl drive?
4863000	4864000	Girl can't drive.
4864000	4865000	Wow.
4865000	4866000	Wow.
4866000	4869000	You mean a big sister?
4869000	4873000	Oh, we don't have a big sister, do we?
4873000	4878000	We do have a mama.
4878000	4882000	Maybe we should do like a cousin third removed for Gentoo.
4882000	4883000	Oh, no.
4883000	4887000	I'm terrible at the different people.
4887000	4889000	Oh, no.
4889000	4891000	Okay.
4891000	4892000	Let's get to it.
4892000	4893000	Everybody.
4893000	4894000	Let's get to it.
4894000	4895000	To it.
4895000	4899000	Let's get them 40s popping.
4899000	4900000	Right.
4900000	4901000	Wait.
4901000	4902000	They can use the ramps.
4902000	4904000	I thought they can use the ramps.
4904000	4906000	I thought only I could.
4906000	4909000	That's how I was like predicting where they were going to go.
4909000	4910000	Go away.
4910000	4911000	No.
4911000	4915000	Get out my way.
4915000	4918000	This is my road.
4918000	4921000	Oh, my God.
4921000	4922000	Sorry.
4922000	4923000	It's like, wait.
4923000	4926000	I don't even know where the controls are.
4926000	4929000	I'm sliding if I do a.
4929000	4931000	I'm definitely lost this one.
4931000	4932000	That's all I'm going to say.
4932000	4933000	We are going to play.
4933000	4935000	We are replaying this for as long.
4935000	4937000	I don't know what the controls are.
4937000	4938000	Can someone tell me what the controls are?
4938000	4943000	Because I'm holding like, oh, I'm a, but I'm like, well, no.
4943000	4947000	I'm holding right trigger, but it keeps making me slide everywhere.
4948000	4953000	And that just instantly stopped my speed.
4953000	4955000	What is going on?
4955000	4959000	I'm confusion.
4959000	4963000	I'm, I'm a philosopher because I'm Confucius.
4963000	4965000	What the heck?
4965000	4966000	Bro.
4966000	4967000	Stop sliding.
4967000	4968000	Crash.
4968000	4969000	Crash.
4969000	4972000	What is going on?
4972000	4973000	Yeah.
4973000	4975000	I've definitely haven't won this one.
4975000	4977000	Get out of my way.
4977000	4980000	I'll rearrange you and make it look like an accident.
4980000	4981000	Wait.
4981000	4983000	I don't know what.
4983000	4984000	Sorry.
4984000	4987000	I'm going to have to look up the controls for this game mode because I'm definitely doing
4987000	4988000	something wrong.
4988000	4991000	Like crash speeds up and then he slows down.
4991000	4992000	Wait.
4992000	4993000	I'm not.
4993000	4996000	I don't have any turning power when he does that.
4996000	4997000	Crash.
4997000	4998000	Crash.
4998000	4999000	Crash.
4999000	5001000	Our insurance bill is going to be.
5001000	5002000	Oh, wait.
5002000	5003000	Whoa.
5003000	5004000	They really said Mario Kart out here.
5004000	5005000	Yeah.
5005000	5007000	They said if you fall off the map, it's fine.
5007000	5010000	Whoa.
5010000	5012000	Controls just accelerate.
5012000	5014000	I just accelerated and got sixth place.
5014000	5019000	So something tells me I'm doing something wrong.
5019000	5021000	Strongly confirmed for Gen 2.
5021000	5026000	I need first to progress to the next mission.
5026000	5031000	Guys, I have a terrible feeling we're going to be here.
5031000	5032000	She's got ran over.
5032000	5035000	Did you see that?
5035000	5037000	Insurance fraud simulator on a flu.
5037000	5041000	She's got ran over.
5041000	5044000	Oh my God.
5044000	5045000	Child's game.
5045000	5046000	It's okay.
5046000	5048000	You're sixth place, but we still love you.
5048000	5050000	Literally green.
5050000	5051000	Is it?
5051000	5052000	Is there?
5052000	5055000	Accelerate just before a green light to boost.
5055000	5059000	One, two, boost.
5059000	5060000	That.
5060000	5061000	Okay.
5061000	5062000	Hold on a minute.
5062000	5063000	We're getting strats.
5063000	5066000	I managed to read the help screen.
5066000	5067000	Okay.
5067000	5068000	Okay.
5068000	5069000	Let him get up.
5069000	5070000	Let him get up.
5070000	5072000	Get out my way.
5072000	5073000	Right.
5073000	5077000	Everyone's doing that, but I actually don't know if you're slower on ramps or not.
5077000	5078000	Right.
5078000	5079000	Okay.
5079000	5080000	Hold up.
5080000	5081000	Hold up.
5081000	5082000	Hold up.
5082000	5083000	Hold up.
5083000	5084000	We're getting there.
5084000	5085000	We're getting there.
5085000	5088000	If you cross the road right now, you're such a vampire.
5088000	5091000	You're actually such a freaking idiot.
5091000	5093000	He purposely, can I reset?
5093000	5095000	Because there's no way I'm going to win.
5095000	5096000	Resume.
5096000	5100000	Oh, you can't reset.
5100000	5102000	He's such a liar.
5102000	5106000	Literally swerving into me.
5106000	5107000	I'm faster.
5107000	5112000	I really don't feel it.
5112000	5114000	Why are all these cops on the road?
5114000	5115000	I know.
5115000	5116000	Literally.
5116000	5121000	Meet her springs out here with the cop hiding behind the billboard to catch Lightning McQueen.
5121000	5122000	What's that?
5122000	5126000	I know the lore of freaking cars.
5126000	5127000	Yeah.
5127000	5129000	What are you going to do about it?
5129000	5130000	Wait.
5130000	5131000	Oh my God.
5131000	5136000	Car girl confirmed for Gen 2, but you get to stick it in her exhaust pipe.
5136000	5138000	Oh my God.
5138000	5143000	Did you guys see that thing on YouTube where the guy's in love with his car?
5143000	5149000	It was like my weird obsession and he makes love to his car and it's red.
5149000	5154000	I just remember the car being red and me being like, huh?
5154000	5155000	Huh?
5155000	5156000	Okay.
5156000	5161000	We're actually somehow doing better even though I've played considerably worse.
5161000	5162000	Yeah.
5162000	5164000	Like he keeps going off the map.
5164000	5167000	I don't know why.
5167000	5168000	The A.
5168000	5169000	Ah!
5169000	5170000	Okay.
5171000	5178000	Well, I'm still, excuse me, insurance fraud people on the phone right now.
5178000	5180000	Oh my God.
5180000	5185000	Why did they make this so hard?
5185000	5188000	I just got ran over again.
5188000	5189000	Right.
5189000	5190000	Hold on.
5190000	5193000	Let me look up the controls because I don't think anyone...
5193000	5197000	It said two things to me when I played the game mode for the first time.
5197000	5198000	Hold on.
5198000	5199000	Crash.
5199000	5202000	Bandicoot warped.
5202000	5203000	What is this?
5203000	5205000	Motorcycle controls.
5205000	5206000	Xbox.
5206000	5210000	I'll put Xbox because I'm using Xbox controller.
5210000	5216000	Hold down the X button to accelerate and square to break.
5216000	5218000	I said Xbox controls.
5218000	5222000	We don't have a square.
5222000	5226000	So it's literally breaking go.
5226000	5231000	It's literally just breaking go and that's it.
5231000	5234000	What is accelerate?
5234000	5239000	Is A accelerate?
5239000	5242000	I guess A is accelerate.
5242000	5243000	Right.
5243000	5245000	And then I just need to focus on not...
5245000	5248000	Oh my!
5248000	5252000	Oh!
5252000	5255000	And we don't even have an option to reset.
5255000	5260000	I don't know if I'd be faster to reset and then go again.
5260000	5261000	Bra.
5261000	5265000	Literally.
5265000	5268000	Get out my way, honestly.
5268000	5273000	Can the game tell that I'm a struggling child and then the AI will lower?
5273000	5277000	You know how some of those games have like reflective AI and they're like,
5277000	5278000	oh my God, you're struggling.
5278000	5281000	We're just going to lower the game difficulty for you.
5281000	5284000	Can I have that please?
5284000	5288000	I'm literally struggling so hard.
5288000	5289000	Right.
5289000	5291000	Stop drifting crash.
5291000	5294000	It's causing a lot of issues.
5294000	5297000	It's causing a lot of issues.
5297000	5300000	I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.
5300000	5302000	Can you stop?
5302000	5303000	Oh!
5303000	5304000	Right.
5304000	5305000	Right.
5305000	5306000	Right.
5306000	5307000	Right.
5307000	5308000	Right.
5308000	5309000	I get it.
5309000	5310000	I get it.
5310000	5311000	Crash!
5311000	5312000	Crash.
5312000	5313000	Oh!
5313000	5317000	Well, I'm actually going to have a word with you once the stream is over.
5317000	5320000	Oh my God.
5320000	5321000	Can I really not progress?
5321000	5324000	Wait, I'm going to back out and see if I can just skip to the next level
5324000	5329000	because oh my God.
5329000	5333000	And there's so many police on the road and they're not even doing their job.
5333000	5335000	You're not even a civil servant.
5335000	5340000	You're not even serving the public at all just hanging about on Route 66 for any reason.
5340000	5342000	Honestly.
5342000	5345000	Nay wonder, like folk call themselves a sovereign citizen.
5345000	5348000	You ain't doing shit.
5348000	5350000	No again, please.
5350000	5355000	Oh my God.
5355000	5356000	Please.
5356000	5357000	Okay.
5357000	5362000	I'm going to back out and I'm going to see if we can progress to the next thing
5362000	5364000	because this is impossible.
5364000	5365000	Nay wonder, Coco.
5365000	5366000	Right.
5366000	5367000	No.
5367000	5369000	Don't restart level.
5369000	5370000	Give me a break.
5370000	5371000	Let me come back to it.
5371000	5376000	Let me come back to it because I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
5376000	5379000	I don't know how I'm supposed to do it.
5379000	5380000	Right.
5380000	5385000	We're not doing road crash more like right.
5385000	5386000	Hang time.
5386000	5388000	So what did I just do?
5388000	5389000	12.
5389000	5390000	No.
5390000	5393000	What?
5393000	5394000	Okay.
5394000	5397000	We're doing 15.
5397000	5398000	Oh wow.
5398000	5399000	It does let you skip ahead.
5399000	5400000	Thank God.
5400000	5401000	You need that crystal.
5401000	5402000	No.
5402000	5403000	Eh?
5403000	5404000	Go away.
5404000	5405000	Wait.
5405000	5406000	Oh.
5406000	5407000	Okay.
5407000	5420000	You can't even do anything against these guys at all.
5420000	5421000	How did I...
5421000	5426000	I didn't want to break it but hey ho.
5426000	5427000	Oh.
5427000	5430000	You don't get anything out of them?
5430000	5431000	Right.
5431000	5434000	I can definitely do this.
5434000	5435000	Whee.
5435000	5436000	What?
5436000	5443000	Who put all this poison to turn the fricking frogs game?
5443000	5444000	There's...
5444000	5445000	Wait.
5445000	5447000	How am I supposed to get past?
5447000	5448000	Oh my gosh.
5448000	5450000	That was like so close.
5450000	5451000	I'm sorry.
5451000	5455000	I don't know what the hitbox is like in this game.
5455000	5460000	But I'm feeling it Mr. Krabs.
5460000	5461000	Oh okay.
5461000	5465000	I was just going to belly flop.
5465000	5471000	Well that wasn't worth it.
5471000	5472000	Swing.
5472000	5473000	Swing.
5473000	5474000	And then get past.
5474000	5475000	Okay.
5475000	5476000	We're doing it.
5476000	5477000	We're doing it.
5477000	5478000	It's fine.
5478000	5479000	It's fine.
5479000	5480000	So if I do this...
5480000	5481000	No that's not...
5482000	5487000	I don't really want to set it all.
5487000	5488000	Wah.
5491000	5493000	Oh shit.
5493000	5497000	I thought I had enough distance to do that.
5497000	5498000	Okay.
5498000	5499000	I won't do that again.
5499000	5500000	I'll leave the TNT as is.
5500000	5505000	I don't need anything from the TNT.
5505000	5506000	Two.
5506000	5507000	One.
5507000	5508000	Jump.
5509000	5510000	Swing.
5512000	5513000	Wah.
5513000	5514000	It almost perished.
5514000	5515000	Right.
5515000	5517000	We're leaving TNT alone because I don't know how to deal with it.
5517000	5519000	I ain't smart enough for this.
5519000	5520000	Swing.
5520000	5524000	Bouncy bouncy down.
5524000	5525000	Right.
5525000	5526000	I don't need that.
5526000	5530000	I don't really know what to do with it either but I don't need it.
5530000	5531000	Go to the farm.
5531000	5532000	Right now.
5532000	5533000	No.
5533000	5536000	There's a mage.
5536000	5539000	Come on away.
5539000	5542000	Bouncy bouncy down.
5546000	5547000	Farm!
5547000	5548000	Farm!
5548000	5554000	We need lots of floats so they can help with
5554000	5556000	the pests in the garden.
5556000	5557000	Okay.

5888640	5891640	OK, sorry, we need to do hang time.
5891640	5893760	I completely forgot to just do an entire mission.
5893760	5895360	My apologies.
5895360	5899080	Well, you've crashed a few parties before,
5899080	5902600	but I never expected you to make it this far.
5902600	5905000	If you don't turn back.
5905000	5907920	Yeah, I've lived the thousand years
5907920	5911440	as the flag of you, and the entire universe.
5916560	5918000	OK.
5918000	5918920	OK, I can do this.
5918920	5919560	I can do it.
5919560	5921000	And these kind of maps are.
5925360	5926960	Molotov cocktails.
5926960	5928040	I'm sorry, but there's something
5928040	5929560	about the Geneva Convention with that.
5929560	5931200	What's going on here?
5931200	5932560	Oh my God.
5932560	5935920	A magic carpet ride.
5935920	5936760	Oh.
5941760	5945080	Did I just get put in a jar?
5945080	5946480	Oh, wait, I forgot these guys.
5946480	5948120	So Molotovs already.
5948120	5951800	And a magic carpet ride.
5951800	5967000	Oh, I can hardly see that as it comes over.
5967000	5970640	All right, give me a checkpoint because it's not looking good.
5970640	5973320	OK, wow.
5973320	5975520	Isn't this not?
5977640	5980080	No, I'm going to put back here.
5980080	5982400	This is so far away.
5982400	5985320	I better get a checkpoint right now.
5985320	5986680	Give me a checkpoint right now.
5989600	5991920	And me figure when?
5991920	5993640	Go away.
5993640	5997480	And me a figurine.
5997480	6001160	You'll have to like and subscribe a bit more for a figurine.
6001160	6003600	The thing when right.
6003600	6005200	OK, sorry, I'm getting distracted.
6005200	6007680	And if you guys are like serious,
6007680	6009600	but like, oh, when can we get this particular merch?
6009600	6011080	That particular merch.
6011080	6016160	The sad thing is I have to message these companies
6016160	6020360	and then I basically have to go, here's the statistics.
6020360	6021120	Here's.
6021120	6023600	Oh, I almost perished there.
6023600	6027600	And it's like I can't go to a company to produce like merchandise.
6027600	6029240	It's like a lot of money.
6029240	6033080	And and sorry, let me try hard.
6038080	6039400	So OK, that's fine.
6039720	6040920	We got the checkpoint.
6040920	6045360	And and I basically I can't ask for like this merchandise
6045360	6047440	that costs like thousands to be produced.
6047440	6050320	If it's like, yeah, we've got 4,000 subscribers,
6050320	6052000	like it's just not happening.
6052000	6056320	And so, you know, if you ever want to support your girls,
6056320	6059120	just make some clips of them go viral or something.
6059120	6060800	I don't know.
6060800	6062400	OK, holy crap.
6062400	6064800	Wow, this is a risky map.
6064800	6065480	I'm not going to lie.
6066120	6067200	Oh, bonus map.
6067200	6068200	Bonus time.
6071120	6073280	They need a minimum guaranteed return on investment.
6073280	6077560	Yes, like Uber market and we're absolutely fantastic
6077560	6082760	because to get to get.
6084960	6087200	I completely forgot I can double jump half the time.
6090080	6091560	Wait, I don't know.
6092560	6096040	Oh, there we go.
6096040	6099000	And I'm not.
6099000	6101640	I don't want to accidentally fall off the map, to be honest.
6101640	6103040	I'm quite happy just to move on.
6103040	6106240	And yeah, like you need to go to the company
6106240	6108600	and be like, this is what we do.
6108600	6111280	And this is why we're a good fit for you here
6111280	6115640	as a statistic to back up, like, you know, such and.
6117720	6119720	And oh, right.
6119720	6120320	Give me that.
6121200	6124040	You go away.
6124040	6126520	I didn't realize there's flamethrowers here.
6126520	6129600	What's that death?
6129600	6131080	Do I want to go on that one?
6131080	6134240	I did just hit a checkpoint.
6134240	6137040	Oh, no.
6137040	6139040	Oh, no, I just said luck to an achievement for that.
6139040	6141080	OK, get viral, get viral, get viral.
6141080	6143160	Yes.
6143160	6144720	And like, as I said, Uber market
6144720	6148200	were fantastic because they gave three designs.
6148240	6151120	Like, they made three designs for the girls.
6151120	6153400	And it was like, the girls aren't even out.
6153400	6157000	We had absolutely no idea what the estimations
6157000	6160080	were looking like or the success or whatever.
6160080	6163720	And we were much.
6163720	6165480	No wonder they call it the death route.
6165480	6167880	Right, I'm not doing that again.
6167880	6170320	I don't think it's imperative to the clock.
6170320	6173120	Oh, yeah, no, I'm not fussing for the death route.
6173120	6174760	Wee.
6174760	6176200	Why has it got random TNT?
6176200	6180840	You got an A. But, yeah, they were like, yeah,
6180840	6185640	you can have three designs, which was fantastic.
6185640	6191800	And if all, oh, wait, I don't want to touch that
6191800	6194640	because it's TNT.
6194640	6196400	The guys just throwing swords over there.
6202680	6204040	Oh, checkpoint.
6204040	6204920	All right, hold on.
6204920	6205600	Jump.
6208080	6209120	Belly float.
6209120	6211960	Oh, wait, that's TNT there.
6211960	6213320	So it doesn't blow.
6213320	6215840	Oh, go away.
6215840	6216840	You're so creepy.
6219880	6220880	Oh, yeah.
6224600	6225240	Is this?
6225240	6227160	Are you going to?
6227160	6230280	Sugar, that hurt me.
6230280	6231480	That's OK.
6231480	6232000	Um.
6238920	6240880	Oh, I don't like the look of that.
6240880	6244360	Oh, I'm not even in range of it.
6244360	6246960	Oh, my God, his mouth like being wide open.
6246960	6248040	While he's climbing.
6248040	6251440	Oh, thank God, get me off this map.
6251440	6254200	You have to complete them to get the best ending.
6254200	6258040	Isn't there not only one ending where you win this crash
6258040	6260800	pancake game was like that.
6260800	6268560	But I've all met up with this enemy doctor entropy.
6271760	6275360	Isn't entropy when you're like skinny?
6275360	6277600	I'm not thinking of something.
6277600	6282760	Ah, you little vermin are way too stupid to understand
6282760	6285000	what you're getting yourself into.
6285040	6287160	This time, you've done it.
6289760	6292240	Wahaa.
6292240	6294280	Entrophy.
6294280	6297280	There's usually a special 100% completion ending.
6300680	6302960	Uh, jump.
6302960	6303760	What does that mean?
6303760	6306200	What does that mean?
6306200	6306920	What does it mean?
6306920	6308040	I don't know.
6308040	6308520	Woo.
6311960	6314680	Oh.
6315320	6319680	Take that, you scallywag.
6319680	6321680	Ah, OK, OK, OK, OK.
6321680	6322680	Whoa.
6325680	6326680	Oh, my God, the music.
6332680	6333680	Oh.
6336680	6340680	I actually really like that the boss fights aren't that hard.
6340680	6341680	Like, I said it.
6341680	6342680	I'm sorry, I said it.
6342680	6344680	Sorry if this is going to age terribly,
6344680	6346680	and I'm going to struggle with the next boss fight.
6346680	6348680	But I think this is lovely.
6348680	6351680	Like, this is a lovely experience.
6358680	6360680	I spoke far too soon.
6360680	6363680	I apologize for my ignorance.
6363680	6364680	I do.
6364680	6365680	I spoke far too soon.
6365680	6366680	I admit it.
6366680	6368680	I confess to my sins.
6368680	6370680	All right, let's try that again.
6371680	6374680	OK, let's try that again.
6374680	6377680	I never made it this far into the game as a child.
6377680	6382680	I don't think I did either, because I am,
6382680	6386680	I don't recall anything past Coco.
6388680	6391680	I just think that only remember Coco.
6392680	6393680	OK.
6394680	6395680	OK.
6399680	6401680	OK, OK.
6402680	6405680	Right, this time, don't let the missile go to my head.
6405680	6406680	So that'd be great.
6411680	6412680	OK.
6413680	6415680	Wow, I almost jumped into that.
6419680	6421680	Honestly, him laughing is so mean.
6421680	6425680	Like, if I was an evil person.
6429680	6430680	Take this!
6439680	6442680	To spin longer and faster,
6442680	6445680	or to glide while in the air, press X repeatedly.
6448680	6450680	Wow, I love that move.
6452680	6454680	First try, yeah, yeah, first try.
6454680	6455680	First try.
6455680	6456680	First try.
6456680	6457680	Shhh.
6479680	6480680	Is he trying to...
6480680	6483680	Is he trying to guilt-trap us into losing?
6484680	6486680	Who knows what it'll do?
6486680	6487680	Oh, no.
6487680	6489680	Right, let's go back to being a lady,
6489680	6491680	because we did the dread one, isn't she?
6491680	6494680	OK, we're going to Egypt to Arabia.
6498680	6500680	The Sphinxinator.
6502680	6505680	I want to explore your Sphinxinator.
6509680	6512680	Oh my God, is this just going to the left side of the map now?
6512680	6514680	From that previous map?
6514680	6515680	No, it's not.
6515680	6516680	It's just me making stuff up.
6516680	6517680	I'm sorry.
6520680	6522680	Second gen Sphinxinator.
6522680	6524680	Confirmed, honestly.
6524680	6525680	I'm sorry, it's not...
6525680	6526680	Wow!
6526680	6528680	A sarcophagus!
6530680	6531680	Ah!
6531680	6532680	A mummy!
6532680	6534680	And not the good kind like Azura.
6536680	6537680	Wow.
6537680	6538680	Wow.
6540680	6542680	Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
6542680	6543680	Who?
6545680	6547680	OK, that was terrible, Taibin.
6547680	6550680	Can we get like a crossbow, maybe?
6551680	6553680	OK, let's try that again.
6553680	6555680	I don't know when I was supposed to jump for him.
6555680	6557680	I ain't gonna lie.
6557680	6560680	Maybe I was supposed to double jump over the flames, right?
6560680	6561680	You?
6561680	6562680	And then a mummy?
6562680	6564680	OK, that's fine.
6565680	6569680	Return the slime.
6569680	6572680	Watching you play this makes me want to get...
6572680	6573680	Spiral.
6573680	6577680	I've never played Spiral, but people were recommending it.
6577680	6579680	And I was like, I might give it a shot.
6579680	6581680	Give me checkpoint, please.
6581680	6583680	But let the doors close first,
6583680	6585680	because I was 100% gonna fall for that.
6590680	6593680	Hold on, I want the spikes to go up.
6594680	6595680	OK.
6597680	6600680	All right, I'm safe to go on it for this section, which is fine.
6605680	6607680	That sarcophagus is making some...
6608680	6610680	You're scaring me!
6611680	6614680	I like how it pings off onto some of the items to break them for you.
6616680	6618680	Oh god, I'm so bad at this one.
6618680	6619680	Double jump!
6625680	6627680	OK, we need to wait.
6628680	6630680	Spiral is also fun.
6630680	6633680	Yeah, Spiral and Crash Bandicoot can I get...
6633680	6635680	Are they by like the same developers,
6635680	6638680	or was it just they happened to come out
6638680	6642680	kind of close to the same time?
6643680	6645680	What did I do wrong here again?
6646680	6648680	I had nothing to protect me.
6650680	6653680	I'm wondering if I have more time if I do that.
6653680	6654680	Oh, wow, I do.
6654680	6655680	Right.
6657680	6659680	And let me guess, that doesn't explode the T.
6659680	6660680	Oh, no, it does.
6661680	6662680	I was gonna be like,
6662680	6664680	oh, let me guess, it doesn't do anything.
6670680	6671680	Again?
6672680	6673680	Oh, no.
6675680	6677680	Oh, we're struggling with this one.
6680680	6682680	Goodness gravy.
6683680	6685680	Am I making this look easy?
6685680	6687680	No, sorry, am I making this look hard?
6689680	6692680	Right, and then wait for it to come back,
6692680	6694680	and then jump on it,
6694680	6696680	and then defeat the mummy twice.
6697680	6700680	Or the sarcophagi, jeez.
6704680	6706680	Let's try this again.
6706680	6708680	Right, and then I can just double jump here
6708680	6710680	because I'm out of range.
6710680	6713680	And then he's gonna drop that, which explodes that one first.
6713680	6715680	Just fine with me.
6719680	6721680	Right, don't send it.
6721680	6723680	Don't send it, Reflings.
6723680	6726680	If you ever replay this game, don't send it at that section
6726680	6728680	because that's what I thought I had to do there,
6728680	6730680	and it did not pay off.
6730680	6733680	I need to wait until he spawns the second block.
6733680	6734680	We'll get there.
6734680	6736680	It just takes me a few moments.
6736680	6738680	Can't believe it, they made me flat.
6739680	6741680	Lollipop model confirmed for Strony.
6742680	6746680	Right, again, just jump over this, which is fine.
6746680	6748680	Oh, there's not even TNT this time.
6748680	6750680	The game said, yeah, you're struggling.
6750680	6752680	Right, send it, send it, send it, send it.
6752680	6754680	I knew it would work if I sent it.
6754680	6756680	Oh, I've got a checkpoint, goodness.
6757680	6760680	That'll be very welcomed, I assure you.
6762680	6764680	There's really enemies behind this.
6764680	6766680	Yeah, there's freaking TNT.
6769680	6770680	Oh.
6771680	6773680	Take your time.
6775680	6777680	Take your time.
6778680	6780680	Take your time.
6781680	6783680	That will be a mummy.
6783680	6786680	Okay, we're good, we're good, we're doing it, we're doing it.
6788680	6790680	We are doing it, oh.
6791680	6794680	Why would they randomly have a natural, they are.
6794680	6795680	They are.
6796680	6797680	Oh.
6798680	6800680	Oh, send it, send it, send it, send it.
6800680	6804680	I like how he just looks at me, as if I'm not about to coblame him.
6808680	6811680	Uh, this seems suspiciously easy.
6812680	6818680	Rather, this is, this is, this is suspiciously.
6819680	6821680	Ooh, wait, hold on.
6821680	6824680	Two crystals, let's go on the bonus map.
6827680	6829680	Don't send it, no idea.
6829680	6834680	I'm literally giving you the strikes alive, because I'm struggling.
6834680	6836680	Okay, there's lots of TNT.
6837680	6839680	I'll just let it pop and then run away again.
6844680	6846680	Whoa, oh, there's too many.
6849680	6850680	Oh, dear.
6852680	6857680	There's lots of fricking.
6864680	6866680	Oh well, that's the best I can do.
6866680	6868680	The best I can do is what I got.
6869680	6872680	Cocodes, don't look at the explosion, because she's so cool.
6874680	6876680	I start off a guy.
6877680	6882680	Oh, that was a bit rude of me, but I did the job.
6884680	6886680	Oh, there's like monkeys in these pots.
6888680	6890680	Sling your shit elsewhere.
6900680	6904680	Oh my god, he's quaking, his little ankles are gone, he's quaking in his boots.
6907680	6909680	Bam, bam, bam, bam.
6910680	6912680	Oh god, another life, thank you.
6914680	6917680	Okay, ugh, perish, perish.
6919680	6921680	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6921680	6923680	Start quaking more, boom.
6924680	6930680	I don't know what that does, I think you're supposed to like go back when you do that, but I don't go back.
6932680	6935680	There's a message in the discord, I need to be worried.
6936680	6937680	Okay.
6946680	6947680	17.
6948680	6951680	Bye bye blimp, I'm in the sky.
6951680	6953680	Oh my god, we're playing Crimson Skies.
6953680	6956680	Good game, good game, bye bye blimp.
6956680	6959680	If you ever played Crimson Skies in an old old game.
6959680	6963680	Shoot down the blimps, I have 100% health, okay.
6964680	6965680	Oh, how do I shoot?
6965680	6967680	Okay, machine gun.
6967680	6969680	A to do a barrel roll.
6971680	6974680	Wait, I'm already down 10% health?
6974680	6977680	The heck, I only just got started.
6978680	6980680	Oh, man.
6982680	6984680	I'm going, wait that didn't break it.
6987680	6990680	I'm barrel rolling, oh that gives me health.
6991680	6996680	Oh my god, I like this game mode, this is so creative, I like it.
6996680	6999680	Wow, we're getting absolutely obliterated, not gonna lie.
7000680	7004680	We're about to get survivor's bias going on here.
7006680	7010680	Okay, wow, I like that, that was nice and simple.
7010680	7012680	More missions like this please.
7012680	7015680	Wait, not all of us have a high IQ.
7016680	7018680	You're supposed to destroy every box,
7018680	7021680	the green boxes at the end get rid of the natures.
7022680	7025680	Oh my god, that was such a quick and easy one, I like that.
7025680	7027680	Give me more of that, give me more of that.
7027680	7030680	Give me more, give me more, tell no tales.
7030680	7033680	Oh, dead men tell no tales.
7034680	7037680	Oh, someone said do a watch along of...
7046680	7054680	Well, I made a few more vacations to my mechanics since our last encounter.
7055680	7058680	So back on, or be deleted.
7059680	7061680	Or be deleted.
7069680	7072680	Oh my god, yeah.
7073680	7075680	Okay, we did it, we did the ramp.
7075680	7077680	I was like, oh, I missed the timing on the ramp.
7077680	7079680	We still did it.
7081680	7083680	Right, we're safe, we're safe.
7083680	7089680	Man, this freaking game is just like so unapologetically good.
7090680	7093680	Yeah, suck at the racing ones, but that's fine.
7093680	7095680	Sorry, Mr. Seagull, you...
7097680	7099680	I got picked to death?
7099680	7101680	Oh my gosh.
7102680	7108680	Anyway, as I was saying before I got picked to death by a freaking seagull,
7108680	7112680	this game is like so unapologetically good,
7112680	7118680	like it's such a chaotic, fun experience, it's so good.
7118680	7121680	I didn't know the seagulls could hurt me like that.
7122680	7126680	I mean, is he even there? He's not even here this time.
7126680	7130680	So he didn't really care that much about the boxes, did he?
7132680	7134680	That was just like the music.
7134680	7136680	It's so... whoa.
7136680	7139680	That one, that's rude, don't do that again.
7139680	7141680	You upset me.
7142680	7146680	That is just like such a freaking good game experience, honestly.
7146680	7149680	Am I gonna land on that bomb? No.
7150680	7153680	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
7154680	7159680	I probably went like the longest way.
7159680	7162680	I don't know if I had to do that, but that was like the longest way.
7162680	7164680	You're a cuttlefish after all.
7167680	7171680	I'll... I'll cuttle your fish in a minute if you don't...
7171680	7172680	I don't know.
7172680	7174680	Please leave me alone, Mr. Shark.
7175680	7177680	I think I'll just do this checkpoint.
7177680	7180680	Yeah, let's do the checkpoint because I don't trust this.
7180680	7184680	This is... they're starting to really fill it out with enemies, though.
7184680	7187680	It was like bear the first time you played this map.
7187680	7191680	The bombs are moving, there's like enemies everywhere.
7192680	7195680	I mean, I know games are supposed to...
7196680	7199680	Please leave me alone, Mr. Seagull.
7200680	7203680	Nope, nope, that bomb is teasing.
7204680	7207680	That bomb is teasing and teasing me.
7207680	7209680	Right, let's get out of here.
7210680	7212680	Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.
7213680	7216680	But this is like a perfect remaster.
7216680	7217680	Oh, there it is.
7218680	7220680	That's what we need.
7220680	7221680	Oh, I don't want to do...
7221680	7222680	I don't have a checkpoint!
7222680	7223680	I don't have a checkpoint!
7223680	7224680	Give me checkpoint!
7224680	7227680	Give me give me checkpoint, give me checkpoint, give me yeah.
7233680	7236680	Oh my God, I just like cheese that corner there.
7236680	7238680	Okay, we're getting there.
7238680	7240680	We're like... we're doing it.
7240680	7242680	Can I do it first time, though?
7244680	7247680	Oh, I'm getting nervous.
7247680	7250680	Oh, I don't know why I did that, but we'll do it.
7250680	7252680	Oh my God.
7252680	7254680	So good.
7258680	7261680	I'm so surprised how much I'm enjoying this.
7261680	7264680	But then at the same time, I'll always enjoy kids' games.
7264680	7267680	Like literally, Viva Faniata could like blast about for ages.
7267680	7269680	Okay, we just did that one.
7269680	7273680	We're doing 19, which is future frenzy.
7273680	7276680	Ooh, we're going to the city of Caloon.
7277680	7279680	Although they wrecked it.
7281680	7284680	Wow, there's laser beam timing.
7284680	7285680	I miss Viva Faniata.
7285680	7289680	Bro, everyone is waiting for Viva Faniata 3 to be announced.
7289680	7294680	Unfortunately, I didn't like Viva Faniata about trouble and paradise as much.
7294680	7295680	Which is a shame.
7295680	7297680	Oh my God, this is so cool.
7297680	7299680	I like all of this.
7299680	7301680	I'm loving it.
7301680	7302680	Every day.
7302680	7303680	I'm loving it.
7303680	7304680	I'm loving it.
7304680	7305680	Can I destroy that?
7305680	7307680	Okay, I can destroy it when it's like that.
7307680	7308680	Yeah.
7311680	7313680	There's like so much...
7314680	7316680	Wumper fruit.
7318680	7321680	Oh my God, that nature just jumped and it scared me.
7322680	7325680	Right, I can butt bounce this.
7328680	7330680	Wait, we're already done?
7330680	7331680	No, this can't be right.
7331680	7333680	It's going to take me to a new section because there's no way.
7333680	7336680	Yeah, I was going to say there's no way this thing is done.
7336680	7338680	Viva Faniata beats.
7338680	7345680	Yes, in July I am going to start hammering out gamer score.
7345680	7349680	Why is there a reflective stream?
7349680	7350680	Why?
7352680	7354680	She slides so well.
7357680	7358680	I don't like you.
7358680	7360680	I'll jump on your head though.
7364680	7366680	I'll take you.
7367680	7368680	Double jump.
7368680	7369680	Okay, double jump.
7369680	7370680	Double jump.
7370680	7371680	We're learning.
7371680	7372680	Woo!
7378680	7380680	Okay, just jump over it again.
7380680	7381680	Okay, we're learning.
7381680	7382680	We're learning.
7382680	7383680	We're observing.
7383680	7387680	We're using our brain mass against her wills.
7387680	7389680	Hold on, I can double jump over this.
7392680	7393680	Oh, okay.
7394680	7396680	And then we'll butt bounce that.
7396680	7397680	No, we won't.
7397680	7398680	We'll double jump over this.
7398680	7399680	Oh, I almost messed it up.
7399680	7403680	Oh my God, the first checkpoint was so long into this.
7403680	7407680	On the flyer and sorcerer guys, I hate them too.
7407680	7411680	People are waiting for reviews to be announced.
7411680	7413680	And I agree.
7413680	7419680	I would want some sort of remaster or get the same dev team in because they're so precious.
7420680	7421680	Go away.
7421680	7422680	Oh, sugar.
7423680	7424680	Let's try that again.
7424680	7425680	Go away.
7426680	7427680	Wow!
7427680	7428680	What?
7429680	7432680	Yeah, that's exactly what I thought was going to happen.
7432680	7434680	And I was forced to do that.
7434680	7435680	Think again.
7436680	7437680	That guy's red.
7439680	7440680	Go green.
7443680	7444680	Go away.
7447680	7448680	Oh!
7451680	7452680	Oh, I just missed it.
7454680	7455680	Oh, I'm to fly.
7456680	7457680	Oh!
7457680	7458680	All right.
7458680	7459680	Oh, sorry.
7459680	7460680	I thought that was going to explode.
7460680	7461680	Right.
7461680	7462680	We'll do the bonus level.
7462680	7464680	I thought that was going to explode the moment I came near it.
7464680	7465680	Okay.
7465680	7466680	We're safe.
7466680	7467680	Oh, no.
7467680	7471680	The game's telling me to like double triple quadruple jumps and stuff.
7471680	7472680	Wait.
7472680	7474680	Well, double jump and then.
7474680	7475680	Okay.
7475680	7476680	We're fine.
7476680	7477680	We're fine.
7477680	7478680	Kind of.
7483680	7484680	Okay.
7484680	7486680	And we got an extra life.
7486680	7487680	Double jump.
7489680	7490680	Right.
7490680	7493680	We're not doing bonus levels anymore if there's a chance that I can perish in them.
7493680	7496680	I will not stand for such slander.
7496680	7498680	Thank you, Virginia, for the five gives to the members.
7498680	7499680	Shit.
7499680	7500680	And congratulations.
7500680	7501680	We caught it.
7501680	7502680	Enjoy the emotes.
7502680	7505680	I have four 10 emotes up.
7505680	7506680	Wait.
7508680	7509680	Just cross.
7509680	7513680	I have 10 emotes.
7513680	7519680	The girls are getting their batch attend before me because the emotes artist is going to take
7519680	7520680	a month to do them.
7520680	7525680	And I'm crying internally when she told me that because, ouch, why a month?
7525680	7526680	It hurts.
7526680	7528680	And they increased the price as well.
7528680	7529680	It sucks even more.
7529680	7532680	Because I like when emotes all look the same.
7532680	7533680	Like where it's clearly.
7533680	7535680	What the heck am I supposed to do?
7535680	7536680	Ah!
7536680	7537680	Wait.
7537680	7541680	Was I not meant to spam X?
7542680	7545680	You're a capture.
7545680	7546680	Oh, okay.
7546680	7547680	Oh, no.
7550680	7553680	You don't lose lives in bonus levels, though?
7553680	7554680	No.
7556680	7558680	So what am I supposed to do?
7558680	7561680	Yeah, that's exactly what I just tried to do.
7561680	7562680	But it didn't like it.
7562680	7563680	Oh, sorry.
7563680	7564680	I'm like hanging all these away.
7564680	7566680	So go up and then.
7566680	7567680	Coco.
7567680	7568680	Coco.
7568680	7569680	Coco Chanel.
7569680	7570680	I'm going to start.
7570680	7573680	I need to work with your manager because what's going on here?
7573680	7574680	Coco.
7574680	7575680	Double jump.
7575680	7576680	And then X, X, X.
7576680	7577680	And then that's exactly what.
7577680	7578680	Ah!
7578680	7583680	Of course there's a TNT there just to ruin my day.
7583680	7584680	Right.
7584680	7587680	We're not going to double jump.
7587680	7588680	Ah!
7588680	7589680	Coco.
7589680	7590680	Coco.
7590680	7592680	Coco Chanel.
7592680	7598680	Number five is the top leading women's perfume in sales.
7598680	7601680	It's just a fun fact.
7601680	7603680	I think it is anyway.
7603680	7606680	Right, go away.
7606680	7607680	Double jump.
7607680	7612680	I don't know why this is getting so hard.
7612680	7613680	Right.
7616680	7617680	Right.
7617680	7618680	So you do it that way.
7618680	7620680	So go and do it that way then.
7620680	7621680	Coco!
7621680	7622680	Oh my God.
7622680	7624680	Why are you not doing it that way?
7624680	7627680	Why are you not doing it that way?
7628680	7631680	Why are you not doing it that way?
7631680	7632680	You did it the other way.
7632680	7635680	So why won't you do it that way?
7640680	7641680	Right.
7641680	7643680	Double jump.
7643680	7644680	Oh sorry.
7644680	7647680	I'm like throwing all these apples away.
7647680	7648680	Right.
7648680	7649680	Not apples.
7649680	7650680	So fly and then X.
7650680	7651680	No.
7651680	7652680	Right.
7652680	7653680	That didn't work.
7653680	7654680	So fly up and then.
7654680	7655680	No.
7655680	7656680	Why?
7656680	7657680	Sorry.
7657680	7658680	I need to practice doing it this way.
7658680	7662680	But it's actually not doing it that way.
7662680	7663680	It's not.
7668680	7669680	Right.
7669680	7670680	I'm just going to spam A and X.
7670680	7671680	Oh, it worked.
7671680	7672680	It worked.
7672680	7674680	I literally just spammed A and X.
7674680	7675680	I'm so smart.
7675680	7678680	I don't know what the input controls are supposed to be.
7678680	7679680	Ah!
7682680	7684680	You know what?
7684680	7685680	You know what?
7685680	7686680	See this game?
7686680	7688680	I have to go do that section all over again.
7688680	7691680	Because they put a freaking spike over that jump.
7691680	7692680	Oh!
7692680	7695680	And I've just lost my wheat oogabogamask.
7695680	7696680	Bruv.
7697680	7698680	Bruv.
7698680	7700680	I'm getting ruled.
7701680	7702680	I'll blame it.
7702680	7703680	I'll blame it.
7703680	7705680	My room is actually getting pretty warm right now.
7705680	7706680	Right.
7706680	7707680	Just spam A and X.
7707680	7708680	Okay.
7709680	7710680	We'll try again.
7710680	7711680	We'll try again.
7711680	7712680	We'll try again.
7712680	7713680	Wait.
7713680	7716680	Does the game know I'm struggling so it gives me a free mask?
7716680	7719680	I was like, oh, again with the tea.
7719680	7720680	The Nitro.
7720680	7721680	My goodness.
7723680	7724680	Alright, hold on.
7728680	7729680	I don't...
7731680	7734680	I'm trying to observe what I'm doing wrong.
7737680	7738680	No.
7739680	7740680	Is that it?
7741680	7742680	No!
7742680	7743680	Okay.
7744680	7745680	Okay.
7745680	7747680	I know not to go now.
7747680	7748680	Right.
7748680	7749680	Spikes.
7749680	7751680	And jump on his doodle hair.
7751680	7752680	And then jump on that.
7752680	7754680	And then destroy everything and we did it.
7754680	7755680	Okay.
7755680	7756680	Jeez.
7756680	7757680	That was terrible.
7757680	7758680	That was a rough one.
7758680	7759680	That was a rough one.
7761680	7763680	The game giving me a free mask because I'm so bad.
7763680	7764680	You get the petty mask?
7764680	7765680	No.
7766680	7767680	That's terrible.
7767680	7768680	But I got the crystal.
7768680	7769680	That's the main thing.
7770680	7771680	18.
7772680	7773680	I did that one.
7773680	7774680	19.
7774680	7775680	I just did.
7775680	7776680	So, 20.
7777680	7779680	Oh my god, we're getting there.
7779680	7780680	Tomb wader.
7780680	7782680	More like, womb raider.
7782680	7783680	Am I right?
7788680	7789680	Thank you.
7790680	7792680	How many lives lost now?
7792680	7793680	Far too many.
7795680	7797680	Oh, there's scarabs.
7798680	7799680	Whoa, what are you?
7801680	7802680	Oh.
7802680	7803680	Oh.
7804680	7805680	Okay.
7805680	7806680	There's water.
7806680	7808680	I guess I drowned in this game.
7809680	7810680	Right.
7810680	7811680	I guess I can't.
7811680	7812680	What are you?
7814680	7815680	No.
7815680	7816680	You're freaky.
7817680	7818680	Okay.
7818680	7819680	That actually worked.
7819680	7820680	I don't know how.
7823680	7824680	Wah, wah, wah.
7824680	7825680	Coco can't swim.
7825680	7826680	I'm gonna.
7826680	7827680	Let's get another one.
7828680	7831680	We'll stand on this box and let the water rise.
7834680	7836680	Please keep me trying a better one.
7837680	7839680	Oh, I don't like you.
7839680	7840680	Oh, go away.
7841680	7843680	Oh, what are you?
7850680	7851680	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7851680	7852680	That's what I thought.
7852680	7853680	Right.
7853680	7855680	If bonus levels cause me to perish,
7855680	7857680	I'm not really that fast for them.
7860680	7861680	Okay, hold on up.
7861680	7863680	Coco, up before you drown.
7864680	7865680	Oh, go, go, go.
7876680	7877680	Oh.
7877680	7879680	Wait, did that just go down?
7879680	7880680	I did.
7881680	7882680	Sorry, I'm trying to like,
7882680	7884680	peek ahead around the corner of the level
7884680	7886680	to be like, hmm, what comes up next?
7887680	7888680	Oh my God, no.
7888680	7889680	Not now, not now.
7890680	7892680	Wait, you don't drown?
7892680	7893680	Of course you don't drown.
7893680	7894680	Cause why would you?
7895680	7896680	But me?
7896680	7897680	I perish.
7897680	7898680	Oh wait, I'm gonna get this life
7898680	7899680	cause I'm doing so bad.
7899680	7900680	I need the lives.
7900680	7901680	I need the lives.
7903680	7905680	Getting bonks back and forth.
7905680	7906680	Right, but 16 lives.
7909680	7910680	Right.
7910680	7912680	I'm trying to explode some contact.
7913680	7914680	Got another bonus level?
7914680	7916680	Oh no, that's a death level.
7923680	7925680	Oh my God, I don't like time missions.
7925680	7927680	They make me scared.
7928680	7929680	But we made it.
7929680	7930680	Oh, we got the gym.
7933680	7935680	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
7935680	7936680	I'm so sorry.
7936680	7938680	I would like, commentate a bit more,
7938680	7939680	but I'm actually getting stressed
7939680	7940680	out playing this game.
7940680	7941680	Right, I need this platform.
7943680	7945680	The timing missions are like the worst.
7948680	7949680	Cool, cool.
7949680	7950680	Oh, checkpoint.
7950680	7951680	Right, that's all I needed.
7953680	7954680	Right, what are my recent saints?
7954680	7956680	Sorry, I'm like hardly reges at all.
7957680	7959680	Getting bonks back and forth.
7959680	7962680	A staring contest with a freaking game, honestly.
7962680	7965680	I believe the science assistants are robots.
7965680	7967680	Oh my God, we're getting secret hidden lore
7967680	7968680	that I don't know about.
7968680	7969680	Whoa, what was that up there?
7969680	7970680	I saw that.
7971680	7972680	I don't think I didn't see that.
7972680	7973680	Exactly.
7973680	7974680	What did I just do?
7974680	7975680	Whoa.
7978680	7979680	Is it this I just unlocked?
7979680	7982680	I think I probably just did that, yeah.
7982680	7984680	Ain't no way I'm jumping over those nitros.
7984680	7986680	They're going to explode.
7988680	7990680	I'm not even bothering to attack him.
7991680	7996680	Oh, can I make it in time?
7996680	7998680	Please don't crush me.
7998680	7999680	Okay, I made it, I made it.
7999680	8001680	Oh, there's TNT ahead.
8003680	8007680	Honestly, I thought this game was going to take eight hours,
8007680	8009680	but it must be eight hours if you're 100%
8009680	8011680	and like go back and do everything.
8015680	8017680	But yeah, I think we're probably going to be redirecting
8017680	8018680	to any of this.
8018680	8021680	If I'm blasting through the game like this,
8021680	8024680	it honestly would do me quite well
8024680	8027680	because I need to go up with the girls asmr.
8027680	8031680	Whoa, that per beetle just got absolutely annihilated.
8031680	8032680	Bonk.
8036680	8039680	Yes, Mercy and AC's meme asmr.
8040680	8042680	I'd be told I'm allowed to push,
8042680	8044680	I'm allowed to publish, so hopefully they do quite well.
8044680	8045680	Right.
8046680	8049680	Oh, let's go, Coco, you're doing amazing.
8049680	8052680	Right, we are going against Doctor...
8053680	8054680	Oh, engine.
8054680	8056680	Oh, I get it, I get it.
8057680	8060680	Let's hope I don't perish.
8061680	8065680	So, you want to go with your rhymes?
8065680	8070680	When this is over, we'll see who is obsolete.
8072680	8073680	Wah, my Tommy.
8073680	8074680	My Tommy.
8078680	8079680	Eh?
8080680	8081680	Eh?
8081680	8083680	Ooh!
8083680	8085680	What am I to do?
8086680	8089680	I don't know what I'm to do, my shirt is willy.
8090680	8092680	Oh, my God.
8093680	8095680	I'm just spraying, I'm just spraying,
8095680	8097680	staying out of the way, holy crap.
8097680	8100680	The rockets are fricking locking onto me!
8102680	8104680	Why is he shooting from his winky, though?
8104680	8106680	I've not been funny.
8107680	8110680	I don't know what I'm supposed to shoot at,
8110680	8113680	and then I'm getting shot at really badly.
8116680	8117680	Eh?
8117680	8120680	No, nothing's happening to his health.
8122680	8125680	Maybe something's gonna happen after this attack sequence?
8128680	8130680	Oh, his winky single.
8130680	8131680	Oh, okay, I did it.
8131680	8133680	I destroyed his winky.
8133680	8136680	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you're hurting me, you're hurting me.
8137680	8139680	Okay, this one next.
8139680	8142680	Okay, okay, I see it's coming together, it's coming together.
8142680	8144680	I just need you to aim a bit better.
8144680	8146680	Am I to aim at his guns?
8146680	8148680	No, this cannot be right.
8148680	8151680	Although it kind of looks like I'm supposed to aim at his guns,
8151680	8153680	you know that.
8153680	8156680	Oh, but how am I supposed to do that without getting aimed at?
8158680	8160680	Oh, I'm not sure about that.
8160680	8162680	This?
8162680	8166680	Oh, it is, it is, this is guns, it's yellow, shoot the yellow.
8166680	8169680	Oh, my God, the yellow paint before yellow paint was a thing.
8169680	8172680	Oh, my God, Crash Bandicoot, you were before your time.
8172680	8175680	You were truly before your time.
8175680	8178680	Oh, I hardly got any licks in on that one.
8186680	8189680	I don't want to get in that way, but...
8189680	8193680	Okay, they're both sparking, so we're doing good.
8193680	8196680	I'll let him get as we spray out.
8197680	8200680	I'll go up so he can't get at me.
8201680	8206680	Oh, wow, his thing is really strong.
8209680	8212680	I can't really spray into him.
8212680	8215680	Okay, there we go, there we go, there we go, one more.
8215680	8217680	Oh, my God, we did it!
8217680	8221680	Oh, my God, we did it, we're so freaking good at this game.
8224680	8225680	Oh.
8225680	8227680	Uh...
8227680	8229680	Uh...
8230680	8234680	Pura! Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura!
8237680	8239680	Pura's gonna help me!
8241680	8243680	We love Pura!
8244680	8250680	Okay, I'm literally just doing 360s to try and avoid any enemies and just do, like, tag damage.
8254680	8257680	Oh, my God, Pura is helping me so much.
8260680	8265680	Wait, that thing is getting closer to me, whatever that is, oh, it went behind me.
8265680	8268680	Uh, what the heck?
8268680	8271680	I don't know what's going on with that.
8271680	8273680	What?
8273680	8278680	Oh, Poodle, you're helping me so much, darling.
8278680	8280680	Poodle love.
8280680	8282680	We love Poodle out here.
8282680	8286680	Oh my god, yes!
8286680	8289680	We did it!
8289680	8298680	To fire fruit at a target, hold left mouse button to raise a gun and then aim with the direction and press B.
8298680	8302680	Wait, I actually do unlock a crossbow in Crash Bandicoot?
8302680	8305680	No way, that's so good.
8305680	8310680	I got nervous when I saw a face too, not gonna lie, I was like, eww, my confidence is making.
8316680	8318680	Uh huh.
8320680	8325680	Oh my aching head.
8325680	8328680	I'm not feeling myself these days.
8328680	8331680	So the end is in sight.
8331680	8336680	Gather another five crystals and again you will foil my plan.
8336680	8338680	Or will you?
8338680	8340680	He's got veneers.
8342680	8348680	Right, no, we're, wait, so we're falling for his trap if we keep progressing.
8348680	8350680	Wait, I've got my laptop and my laptop.
8350680	8352680	I have two laptops.
8352680	8355680	You're such an MLG gamer, Coco.
8355680	8357680	We're doing it!
8357680	8360680	Gone tomorrow.
8360680	8363680	News today, gone tomorrow.
8363680	8364680	That's the saying.
8364680	8367680	Are all the levels after a saying or like a pun?
8367680	8369680	Honestly, me.
8369680	8372680	Cortex is depressed for a throw.
8372680	8373680	What's going on here?
8373680	8375680	Double jump.
8375680	8377680	Double jump.
8377680	8379680	Double jump.
8382680	8384680	Oh, I don't like that.
8384680	8387680	Wait, double jump.
8387680	8389680	I guess you do even like.
8389680	8391680	Oh, I don't like that.
8391680	8393680	That's awfully menacing.
8393680	8395680	What do you do?
8402680	8404680	Oh wait, what was this?
8404680	8405680	I can unlock now.
8405680	8407680	I think I can throw food.
8407680	8410680	Oh, Coco!
8412680	8414680	Coco!
8414680	8417680	What on earth is that?
8418680	8423680	Coco, that's offensively large and hilarious.
8423680	8425680	Oh, I didn't mean to do that.
8425680	8427680	Sorry, I like jumped right into that.
8427680	8430680	Coco, that's not even a gun.
8430680	8432680	That's a rocket launcher.
8432680	8435680	Oh my gosh.
8435680	8438680	Wait, does this make the game like way easier though?
8438680	8440680	It does!
8440680	8442680	Oh my god, do you see that aim ball?
8442680	8444680	I could...
8446680	8448680	I will safely get past.
8448680	8452680	Bro, Coco, that was so violent.
8452680	8456680	Honestly, she's done asking nicely.
8456680	8457680	She's had enough.
8457680	8460680	She's like, bro, get me out of this game.
8463680	8465680	What, do this?
8465680	8467680	Oh no, I broke the box.
8470680	8473680	Oh my god, I didn't know you had a rocket launcher in Crash Bandicoot.
8473680	8476680	I definitely did not get this far into the game.
8476680	8481680	There's a child, there's a wean, there's a speckle, honestly.
8481680	8485680	I was probably a molecule when I was playing this.
8485680	8488680	I'm just the best in Bandicoot with a rocket launcher.
8488680	8493680	I thought of that meme, but there's like, nah, there's no way I can bring it up.
8493680	8495680	I'll have to let everyone bring it up.
8495680	8497680	Hold on, nah.
8497680	8500680	I can like aim to the sides like this.
8500680	8503680	Thank you, Lord of Strongs for the five gifted membership.
8503680	8506680	Congrats to those who caught it with your face.
8506680	8509680	You'll have to enable membership gifting.
8509680	8511680	You might get a prompt in chat if you don't have it enabled,
8511680	8514680	but congrats to those, you can use my emotes now.
8514680	8517680	Wait, oh my god.
8517680	8519680	I'm getting you.
8519680	8523680	Oh, it's out of bounds off, can't wait one.
8526680	8530680	Oh my god, I can destroy TNT from afar as well.
8530680	8534680	I don't know why I went up, I could have been blue.
8539680	8542680	Oh my god, this makes the game so easy.
8542680	8544680	I love it here.
8544680	8547680	I love fresh Bandicoot.
8547680	8553680	Or Coco can't Bandicoot because Coco Pog.
8553680	8555680	Wow, I almost got done.
8555680	8559680	Congrats on those who caught the member.
8559680	8561680	Wow, see it worked that time,
8561680	8566680	but every other time I try to do the fluffy effect and fly, it never works.
8566680	8569680	She didn't manage to do another two games.
8569680	8572680	I have never actually played the other two games,
8572680	8576680	so I don't know what the experience is like.
8576680	8580680	Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to get rid of all those asses.
8580680	8582680	Oh my god, the game is so kind.
8582680	8585680	It doesn't even go against your ammo.
8585680	8588680	Can I shoot you now?
8588680	8589680	No.
8589680	8591680	Okay, I have to do the dodge.
8597680	8601680	I'm freaking loving this game.
8601680	8604680	Oh my gosh, it's so well put together.
8604680	8606680	Other than the race in one's bus,
8606680	8608680	because I'm dumb and can't figure it out.
8608680	8611680	Ale vivas.
8611680	8613680	Ale vivas.
8613680	8615680	Thank you for coming on Membo.
8615680	8617680	And Lord of the Drums again.
8617680	8619680	For the gifted membership.
8619680	8623680	Me and the Reeflings.
8623680	8628680	Just as I was complaining about a race in the mission.
8628680	8631680	Ah.
8631680	8635680	It's the last one though.
8635680	8638680	It's the last race in mission.
8638680	8643680	Surely.
8643680	8644680	Surely.
8644680	8646680	Two and then go.
8646680	8650680	Right, I got the boost.
8650680	8653680	The police are doing nothing.
8653680	8655680	Oh, I never even saw that.
8655680	8659680	Oh my god, I need my glasses on so badly.
8659680	8666680	Would you still love me as a streamer if I never put my...
8666680	8668680	I'm trying to hold it together.
8668680	8671680	I'm trying to hold it together.
8671680	8675680	I'm at the absurdity that is these maps.
8675680	8676680	For racing.
8676680	8678680	I'm literally seventh place.
8678680	8683680	There's no way.
8683680	8685680	There's no way I've got this.
8685680	8686680	I refuse.
8686680	8690680	Yeah, get in my way.
8690680	8693680	Okay, everyone's using the ramp which is fine.
8693680	8694680	I'll use it too.
8694680	8697680	Okay, you're going to have to use the ramp.
8697680	8699680	Because of the...
8699680	8700680	Bro.
8700680	8702680	These AI police cars!
8702680	8707680	Bro, you can't even reverse in this game.
8707680	8712680	Reeflings, I'm going to have to send my game file to one of you right now.
8712680	8716680	And then you send me it back complete and I'll go do the other missions while I'm at it.
8716680	8720680	Because this is ridiculous.
8720680	8726680	Why did they make the freaking driving one so hard?
8726680	8733680	And Crash, if you didn't stop skating everywhere across the map, we're actually going to have issues.
8733680	8735680	Out my road.
8735680	8736680	Okay, well that was terrible.
8736680	8738680	Please don't ever do that again.
8738680	8740680	I'm fifth place.
8740680	8744680	Oh, and I missed it!
8744680	8747680	Okay, the AI can actually go off road which is interesting.
8747680	8749680	I didn't know that.
8749680	8753680	The AI is adapting and I'm getting nervous.
8753680	8755680	Why are they...
8755680	8758680	Oh, and I missed it again.
8758680	8760680	I'm fourth place.
8760680	8762680	Honestly, that wasn't awful.
8762680	8763680	I'm wondering...
8763680	8764680	Right, we'll keep doing it.
8764680	8765680	We'll keep doing it.
8765680	8766680	We'll keep doing it.
8766680	8769680	That was the first time I played the map and the first thing I did was fall off it, okay?
8769680	8775680	Refillings are always thrilled to Princess Carrie and Momé, honestly.
8775680	8776680	I just wish...
8776680	8777680	I just...
8777680	8778680	I just...
8778680	8780680	I'm getting filtered by a child, okay?
8780680	8783680	Three, two, and then hold, boost.
8783680	8788680	Okay, and then on the left side there is already an issue.
8788680	8795680	So the AI is actually choosing to go off the map, which is curious.
8795680	8799680	I didn't think the AI did such a thing.
8799680	8802680	Very curious indeed.
8802680	8807680	Yeah, they're all avoiding the pull-offs.
8807680	8809680	So just take it easy.
8809680	8811680	These corners didn't do so...
8811680	8814680	Yeah, I didn't do so hot in these corners.
8814680	8816680	Wah!
8816680	8819680	I'll take that boost though.
8819680	8820680	I'll take that boost.
8820680	8822680	Thank you.
8822680	8825680	I have to take this ramp because there is a gap.
8825680	8826680	You will not make it.
8826680	8827680	Go Minasori.
8827680	8830680	You will not make it if you take that gap.
8830680	8832680	It's okay.
8832680	8833680	No!
8833680	8834680	Fenderbender!
8834680	8836680	Fenderbender!
8836680	8838680	That's illegal.
8838680	8840680	You have to stop and call the police!
8840680	8845680	Aw, fuck this.
8845680	8847680	Okay, hold on.
8847680	8848680	Can you Fenderbender?
8848680	8850680	Elsewhere, please!
8850680	8851680	Elsewhere.
8851680	8853680	Okay.
8864680	8865680	I'm trying.
8865680	8867680	I'm actually trying so hard right now.
8867680	8870680	I'm sweating my cheeks off.
8870680	8873680	I'm sweating my panties off, but you all know what's happening with that.
8873680	8875680	Oh, I might do it!
8875680	8877680	Oh my god, I might do it.
8877680	8879680	Oh my god, just don't...
8879680	8881680	No!
8884680	8889680	My mouth is a gap from how hard I'm trying right now.
8889680	8890680	Oh!
8890680	8892680	Oh my god, I did it in two!
8892680	8894680	Oh!
8894680	8895680	Thank god.
8895680	8896680	Thank god.
8896680	8897680	Oh my god.
8897680	8900680	That was so freaking hard.
8900680	8903680	Literally maximum mouth breathing.
8903680	8907680	All wrinkly parts of my brain were locked in.
8907680	8911680	All the smooth parts of my brain were told to be quiet momentarily.
8911680	8913680	Oh my goodness, Gravy.
8913680	8917680	Thank god I never have to do a racing mission again.
8917680	8918680	Oh.
8920680	8922680	Victoire!
8922680	8923680	Victoire.
8923680	8925680	Oh lolol.
8925680	8928680	Oh, such a good game.
8928680	8929680	I'm sorry.
8929680	8930680	I'm absolutely loving this.
8930680	8932680	I highly recommend it, Revenge.
8932680	8937680	If you have got some money to spare right now
8937680	8939680	and you want to give a game-ish...
8939680	8940680	Hey!
8940680	8942680	I was on top of your heat.
8942680	8946680	I heavily recommend getting the V-Master Crash Bandicoot
8946680	8949680	because this is just fun.
8949680	8951680	I have to wait until the Knife Man goes away
8951680	8954680	and then I don't come this way.
8954680	8955680	Great.
8955680	8956680	Flamethrower?
8956680	8957680	I'm just fine.
8957680	8960680	Oh, the guy's gone now.
8960680	8962680	The game helps you if you're rubbish as well,
8962680	8964680	which is even better.
8964680	8966680	The game is holding my hand.
8966680	8969680	Oh my god, I can't believe a refling made this game just for me
8969680	8972680	because they knew how much I struggle.
8972680	8973680	Oh my god, reflins.
8973680	8974680	You're actually so selfless.
8974680	8976680	It's stunning.
8976680	8978680	You're so polite.
8978680	8980680	We've got a checkpoint.
8980680	8982680	What's going on here?
8982680	8983680	I made it anyway.
8983680	8985680	I don't know what's going on, but I made it anyway.
8985680	8986680	There's a little thing to the right.
8986680	8988680	I'm tempted to go explore,
8988680	8991680	but we'll go explore to the right.
8991680	8992680	What's over here?
8992680	8996680	Don't think I didn't see that.
8996680	8999680	I thought it was a hidden thing to the right.
8999680	9000680	And it's not.
9000680	9003680	You're telling me it's not a hidden area to the right?
9003680	9008680	Bro, I'm sorry, but reflins are pranking me.
9008680	9011680	I can't believe you got in the dev team just to prank me, bro.
9011680	9013680	Whoa, there's TNT there.
9013680	9015680	I want to interact with none of that.
9015680	9016680	I want none of this.
9016680	9019680	I want any problems.
9019680	9020680	I don't want peace.
9020680	9024680	I want to problem me giving myself more work is literally that mean.
9024680	9025680	I don't want peace.
9025680	9034680	I want problems.
9034680	9037680	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we ain't going.
9037680	9040680	We ain't going until you go.
9040680	9044680	Prince Ali, mighty is he.
9044680	9048680	Oh, blah, blah, blah.
9048680	9052680	Show some respect for you.
9052680	9055680	Oh, that's not a platform.
9055680	9056680	Okay.
9056680	9058680	Sorry, there's not a platform there.
9058680	9061680	Oops.
9061680	9064680	Oh, and I missed.
9064680	9067680	I think Coco just like constantly has her laptop on her.
9067680	9068680	She's like, yeah, I need this.
9068680	9069680	Honestly, it's safe.
9069680	9074680	I'm like, bro, but I need internet access to all things.
9074680	9075680	Okay.
9075680	9076680	Flamethrower, that's fine.
9076680	9080680	Do not go on the fake platform that isn't a real platform.
9080680	9081680	Okay.
9081680	9089680	You're going to be sorely disappointed that to find there's nothing.
9089680	9094680	Whoa, that was actually really lucky timing.
9094680	9097680	What's going on here?
9097680	9099680	I think the camera angles.
9099680	9101680	At first, I actually didn't like that.
9101680	9104680	I couldn't control that camera angle, but now I'm like, I get it now.
9104680	9108680	This is actually pretty, pretty nice.
9108680	9114680	This is pretty rewarding.
9114680	9116680	As much as we love a cheeky.
9116680	9118680	Oh, wow.
9118680	9123680	How often do you throw?
9123680	9124680	Right.
9124680	9125680	Okay.
9125680	9132680	I saw him peek and I was like, I'm about to get in trouble.
9132680	9133680	Right.
9133680	9135680	Jump and then jump again.
9135680	9136680	Okay.
9136680	9137680	We're getting there.
9137680	9138680	We're getting there refunds.
9138680	9139680	Oh my God.
9139680	9140680	An extra life.
9140680	9141680	Don't mind me.
9141680	9146680	The only thing I don't miss from the era is the time control.
9146680	9148680	Oh my God.
9148680	9152680	We're absolutely smoking.
9152680	9155680	We're smoking and no tobacco is needed.
9155680	9158680	Okay.
9158680	9160680	Wow.
9160680	9163680	So we only got two more levels and it's a boss fight.
9163680	9165680	Mad Bomba.
9165680	9167680	Bombadier.
9167680	9168680	Remember your bazooka.
9168680	9170680	Oh, I already forgot I had one.
9170680	9172680	Crash Coco.
9172680	9176680	Remember, it is not only Dr. Cortex that we battle.
9176680	9180680	Beware of Uka Uka, my children.
9180680	9187680	He is a far more dangerous enemy than anyone can imagine.
9187680	9189680	Oh no.
9189680	9192680	That's not good.
9192680	9194680	Shoot down the Bombadier.
9194680	9196680	Shoot down the bombers.
9196680	9201680	Like these planes that can shoot me.
9201680	9202680	Oh my God.
9202680	9207680	We're committing artillery warfare.
9207680	9214680	Get that plane done.
9214680	9217680	I'm going to just do this.
9217680	9218680	Are you a badie?
9218680	9220680	Yeah, you are.
9220680	9226680	Okay, so I can shoot the enemies as they appear and then I don't get hit by them.
9226680	9228680	Okay, that's pretty good to know.
9228680	9232680	Man, this one was so far away.
9232680	9234680	Okay, there we go.
9234680	9239680	Destroy this guy completely wholeheartedly.
9239680	9244680	I did see someone's one in there, but I think we're okay.
9244680	9245680	Okay, there we go.
9245680	9246680	I'll take the health now.
9246680	9251680	I don't know if that was a bit too preemptive, but we're doing it.
9251680	9252680	Oh, I see him.
9252680	9253680	I see him.
9253680	9254680	I see him.
9254680	9255680	I see him.
9255680	9256680	I see him.
9256680	9261680	He was going to become a Kazian.
9261680	9262680	Jeez.
9262680	9266680	Okay, we're getting there.
9266680	9268680	We've got two more bombardiers.
9268680	9269680	What?
9269680	9271680	Sorry, the controls are inverted.
9271680	9276680	Sorry, I'm used to the controls being inverted for this.
9276680	9278680	Man, I'm absolutely smoking.
9278680	9280680	Sorry, I'm actually so good at this child game.
9280680	9284680	I need head pads for how good I am at destroying this child game.
9284680	9294680	I need accolades to forever recognize me as so good at beating up this game.
9294680	9297680	It's fantastic.
9297680	9298680	We did it.
9298680	9300680	Okay, we almost did it.
9300680	9301680	Wait, hold on.
9301680	9302680	Let me turn around.
9302680	9304680	Let me just get these guys first.
9304680	9305680	Turn around.
9305680	9310680	Every now and then I get to see you.
9310680	9311680	Oh my goodness.
9311680	9313680	Oh, I'm getting head pads.
9313680	9315680	You're in so good moment.
9315680	9316680	Good girl.
9316680	9320680	I was thinking of Sly Culver too.
9320680	9322680	You regularly get the petty mask.
9322680	9323680	No, don't point that out.
9323680	9324680	Don't tell them that.
9324680	9326680	No one needs to know that.
9326680	9331680	I don't get the petty mask that much, okay?
9331680	9334680	Okay, I just did that.
9334680	9335680	What's this?
9335680	9340680	A bug light, not to be confused with a bug's life.
9340680	9342680	Okay, you're doing great.
9342680	9343680	Thank you, Reflink.
9343680	9345680	This game is absolutely fantastic.
9345680	9346680	I cannot recommend this enough.
9346680	9351680	I may actually recommend the girls play it just because you don't really need any previous
9351680	9353680	knowledge other than that first dinosaur.
9353680	9367680	I was having a stroke trying to figure out how to get the dinosaur to not coblame on me.
9367680	9371680	I've got a little guide for the girls that has a list of the games that they can play
9371680	9377680	based on complexity, but I actually need to make it a much better list because I need
9377680	9383680	to add how long it takes to play or these temporary areas.
9383680	9387680	Oh, it's Navi.
9387680	9389680	Oh, wait.
9389680	9393680	Oh my God, I have my own light source.
9393680	9397680	It's beautiful.
9397680	9400680	All right, double jump, X, and we're safe.
9400680	9404680	Oh, this is beautiful.
9404680	9406680	Another light for me?
9406680	9407680	Oh, he got tired.
9407680	9408680	He needs to go to bed.
9408680	9409680	That's okay.
9409680	9412680	You don't have to do this for your entire life.
9412680	9414680	Oh, I keep throwing my apples away.
9414680	9415680	Oopsie.
9415680	9421680	Hmm, how far away did I just get put back?
9421680	9424680	Oh, I'll get masked right next to this one point.
9424680	9427680	Johnny's been fine, but most importantly, she's enjoying herself.
9427680	9428680	Everyone's happy.
9428680	9429680	Stream is bliss.
9429680	9430680	Oh, that's so precious.
9430680	9433680	I'm glad you guys are happy.
9433680	9439680	Oh, I keep throwing away me one for fruit.
9439680	9440680	Okay.
9440680	9444680	You can now go into retirement and then I'll take you.
9444680	9446680	And then what did I do wrong here?
9446680	9447680	I already forgot.
9447680	9448680	What's that?
9448680	9453680	No, Coco, you're spinning everywhere.
9453680	9454680	Okay.
9454680	9456680	Jump and then double jump.
9456680	9457680	See?
9457680	9458680	Nice and simple.

10372280	10377080	No one has completed the game. Maybe speedrunners. 12 minutes would be broken the game
10378000	10383480	The other game is designed to play one-handed. Oh, it absolutely is we can't we can hardly even talk about it
10383480	10387160	I'm going to get the girls to record them playing it

10434160	10439680	Think I undid all my progress. Oopsies. I did all my progress. That's too busy yapping
10442280	10444280	Don't worry though
10444960	10446960	We all make mistakes
10448920	10455600	Yeah, no, that's well, there's no point in saving because I'm already saved up. Oh, well, it's fine. It's fine. That was
10456400	10463760	Fantastic, right. I'm gonna check if there's any veal or girlies on and I understand that this is a shorter stream
10463760	10467640	I thought it was gonna be an eight hour stream, but I was wrong and
10468320	10470320	but in exchange
10471160	10473080	in exchange

10478080	10482040	Mercy and AC's meme ASMR is gonna be uploaded at a certain time
10482040	10487440	It might be timed after the stream because I think mercy asked for me to make sure it's after she finished streaming
10487920	10492280	She's gonna end up all savings over the 30% also. No, no, no, no, no
10492640	10496840	Emi is up in an hour. That's perfectly fine with me. Um, oh

10643640	10648760	That that got really popular for like no reason. Oh my god. I don't want to brag or anything. Hold on
10648760	10652120	Let me let me screenshot so I can show you guys the dirty details
10652840	10658120	The dirty details the the oh, sorry. I just blurt flash behind myself trying to save this file save file
10659080	10665800	That one. Uh, actually, I can just take off the reactive model. That's probably a bit better of an idea. Don't you think?
10669160	10671960	Wait, so it's just a zero
10674120	10677560	Um, right hold on. How do I show?

10722840	10727000	Thingings it literally says 3000 watch hours. That's how much you need to get monetized
10727000	10733000	You need that one video alone. You need 500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours that one video alone
10733800	10736040	I could submit for monetization. That's insane
10736840	10744120	And also, of course, I'm breaking the bank at 20. Please don't be don't be surprised when the 3d models come out

11337400	11346840	Um, I'm too embarrassed to like tell them how much I like despise debt and credit cards and how like the economies rigged against them, especially because like
11347640	11348920	um
11348920	11352760	They may or may not live in America, which makes it even like
11353880	11355880	Everything is against them
11356040	11360200	Like she'd be told a story about her crashing a car and then she jumped off a cliff or something
11361160	11366520	I'm like, yeah, I'm too embarrassed to tell the girls that part. I just say to them like, oh, you're doing great. Um
11367400	11371320	I just need this ASMR script from you. I'll edit the rest. You guys just have fun
11373720	11377960	It's too late for me. It's over two weeks and I hear your voice in my head all the time
11379080	11383080	Have I successfully mind broken you dear refling?
11384440	11386440	Why do you act like you don't want to?
11389080	11391080	Let it happen
11391080	11393720	Let me see into every part of you
11394600	11396600	Until it's all
11402840	11406440	Glad I could mind break you though. I've not even done that part of the hypnosis yet
11407720	11415080	I mean, we ain't even done the tear list yet where I explain in detail every scenario I want to do to you because of that tag
11419080	11421080	Hydration check
11424520	11427880	Stroni you make me fragile when you talk like that. That's why I do it
11430040	11433000	They're gonna be a little me mark and be all happy and stuff
11435080	11437080	But I do like the juxtaposition
11438920	11441400	As well as many other positions hold on a minute
11443080	11445080	Thank you
11445400	11447000	Here all week
11447000	11449400	Dear mommy. Oh, I did beat that one
11453960	11455960	Oh
11459800	11463240	Wow someone's analizing my ovulation cycle
11464120	11468680	So a normal ovulation cycle lasts about 24 hours each month. This is correct
11469080	11472840	Once an egg is released from an ovary it will dissolve within 12 to 24 hours
11473800	11478520	If it's not fertilized and the window is about a week before ovulation since seeds survive for almost a week
11478760	11480440	so basically
11480440	11487160	If I was to try and fertilize you I would need to do it the day before for optimum success chance
11487240	11489240	Which means the 13th of the month
11489880	11492600	All refling you went gen 2 already
11493480	11497640	You missed your window of opportunity. You're gonna have to try again next month with me, huh?
11498440	11501880	And we'll just keep trying and trying and trying
11506200	11508200	Uh
11508360	11510360	Okay
11514360	11516360	Hi, strongy. Hi replaying
11517640	11520760	Just wanted to say that I appreciate your content so far
11521720	11524600	Well, I absolutely continue support. Oh, thank you. I'm glad I'm glad
11525080	11529320	I'm a bit nervous sending you my first marshmallow. Oh, don't worry. I don't bite
11530360	11532360	hard
11532520	11534200	Uh
11534200	11539000	But I'll be sure to send you some more stuff in the future quick question any advice for aspiring script writers
11539080	11544520	Make sure to smash that like button and subscribe to my marshmallow account for more content. What?
11545800	11547800	What does that mean? Um
11548120	11554040	Any advice for aspiring script writers consume content and then do what you like
11555080	11561640	The easiest way for things to naturally occur and no then again. I am I have a raging
11562200	11567400	Uh tism over things which helps me like just absolutely work out the wazoo
11567880	11570440	Um, whenever I'm presented with a new
11571320	11574040	Special interest that I'm being educated about
11575160	11580440	I will consume multiple videos of that content. I will I'll put them in times too so I can
11581240	11585080	Understand the language that's being used the scenario or situation
11585560	11591000	Um, and then I just say I like this part, but I didn't like this part. I will do this
11591800	11596200	And I will do that and make it my own. That's basically how I tip scripts
11597560	11601800	It's not that it's not like saying honestly, the behind the scenes is rather boring
11604200	11608280	Hmm do risky things happen on membership stream. I don't know
11609480	11612520	Uh, we're doing a tag rating stream
11613880	11620520	Uh for my first stream ever doing a watch along. Um, I think we're actually watching transformers
11620920	11623400	The first transformers were sam wit wiki
11623880	11628360	Sam congrats if you're named sam by the way, but his name is sam wit wiki
11630040	11633400	His marshmallow cherry yonk my cherry now
11634840	11639320	Reflings have six tentacles you have eight you have eight arms
11640200	11642200	But you make a little love heart
11642840	11648040	With your front tentacles because we love each other and you got your little nicotine that
11648040	11650040	With
11650680	11652680	Actual cannibal shy and the buff
11653640	11658680	The o7 movie. Yeah, like it's like we're she a love off shy a love off. Sorry. She uh
11659640	11661640	She ain't love off. Um
11662440	11664440	Did you enjoy
11664680	11666680	The filian fanfic?
11668120	11674040	It'll be on fanfic or this local filian fanfic. Oh, I
11675480	11677480	Don't know where the location of that was
11678040	11680040	I
11690440	11697320	You know stroney my phone broke recently and all it did was glow green and start moving up and down
11697560	11700360	Kind of like when you start glowing it reminds me of you
11701720	11707160	Your phone broke. I'm I'm literally hacking into your technology right now. So you become even more obsessed
11707720	11709720	It's working
11709720	11712440	The nicotine patch subdues you for a little bit, but
11713400	11717160	Unfortunately, I get a bit too intense, which is why I need to subdue you
11718680	11721880	Editing a silly burp compilation of one of the girls. What do you think?
11722440	11723640	Uh
11723640	11730040	Yeah, I don't see why not. I'm not being funny. Someone said that a she be let out a to
11730920	11734680	I didn't I'm gonna freaking message she be after the stream and be like
11734840	11736920	Can I clip your to because whenever
11738280	11741560	A toot gets clipped. Um, all of a sudden
11742280	11745640	Um, it's like super funny and ha ha and all of that
11746200	11748200	um, so literally the start of the
11748920	11752520	Short is going to be like brian tts being like vtuber
11753160	11755160	accidentally farts on stream
11755240	11759720	And and play the clip and then oh, oh a hundred thousand views, please
11760200	11763320	Please give she be a cabillion subscribers. Yeah
11764280	11767720	Need to go ask the girls. I literally I need to go put in the discord
11767800	11773000	If any of you have farted, uh, please let me know so I can clip it if you're comfortable. Let's be clipping it
11773160	11775720	Oh my god edit my gen mates part. Oh
11777640	11783240	What a weird timeline we live in my ancestors were peasants working in the fields
11783560	11790040	If only they knew that the one who surpassed like the bloodline ends up editing a toot
11790600	11795640	Do you think my ancestors would laugh at that or they'd just be like what is going on over there? They're like, no, I can't handle this
11798280	11804360	Oh the archive of our own link. No, I didn't read it. Yeah, I got a bit nervous because I don't know what archive of our own is
11804440	11806440	I think it's just for text and stuff
11807400	11809400	um
11810520	11815480	I'm sorry mummy, but when you rage at games, I think of you are wording me with that passion
11816440	11820520	Or replaying. I don't think we're allowed to say that out loud
11822440	11824440	But that's hot
11825960	11830360	That's amazing. Have you ever played metal gear before I haven't
11831000	11836840	Um, is it easy if it's easy? I'll play it. Is there a story mode for gamers like me?
11839240	11844840	He's just the one that's saying it out loud wait post that meme where it's the guy like standing up
11844840	11850040	Hold on. Wait standing up meme guy. Uh, he's like standing up in a courtroom
11850760	11854760	Oh my god, I've got it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on
11854920	11860760	Wait, let me make the meme. Let me make the meme. No one say a thing or I'm gonna forget how to make the meme
11860840	11862840	Okay, I've got the jpeg
11863240	11869400	And then I need to open it up in ms pain. Hold on. Let me open up the picture in ms pain
11869640	11871960	No one say a thing. Okay. Let me cook
11872600	11874600	Let me cook
11874920	11876920	Let me
11877240	11878440	Cook
11878440	11882600	Let me cook. This is so bad. This is terrible
11883800	11886200	Reflins, you're such a naughty influence on me
11889000	11891000	Said by one refling together
11893720	11899960	Okay, is that gonna work? I mean, I think it's gonna work. Yeah, okay, it's working
11900120	11909640	You can tell of me this is an ms pain. Oh my god. Hold on. Are you ready for this? Are you ready?
11916280	11921640	Oh, we are lost it. Oh no, it's like we're down here. This is literally
11921640	11923640	Oh
11928120	11930120	No
11931000	11934200	A thing thank you for the tip slice saver
11938200	11943800	Refling you're standing up against the masses. You're so brave for saying that part out loud
11944600	11946600	Oh
11946920	11951160	That's so terrible. I hope no other beach ever comes in stream and sees that
11952040	11955160	Oh my god, that's terrible
11955800	11963240	Why are we like this together? We bring out the worst side in each other like the the degenerate side in each other
11963880	11965880	honestly
11966360	11968360	Hmm
11968440	11974200	Moment are you gonna take the bit of some little test again? Yeah, I'll take it
11975880	11977320	Um
11977320	11979320	We can 100% do that stuff
11979960	11984760	I have no problem with that stuff. Where's the mean best? He speaks the truth
11985320	11990520	And they hated him for he spoke the truth. I can't I'm not gonna edit into that Jesus meme
11991320	11993320	I
11993720	11998280	Hi, Stony. I want you to bite me all over and leave marks all over me including on my tentacle. I
11999160	12001960	I wouldn't do it hard. Okay. I wouldn't do it hard
12003480	12005480	I would do it to a degree
12005480	12011240	Okay, I'm all caught up with marshmallows. So I'm just gonna be staring at you now chat. What are you gonna do about it, huh?
12012840	12014680	What are you gonna do? Sorry, I'm burping away over here
12015400	12021560	We're a match made in something probably not heaven because we can't make it into heaven
12021880	12026440	With this stuff that we go on about we can't make it into heaven. Oh, no
12028280	12030280	Stare back
12034120	12037800	I feel like I could uh, I'm terrible at blinking contests
12038520	12044360	I remember everyone in the playground was like, oh, I do do stare contest and I would always lose because I suck
12044760	12047960	I'm already in heaven. No need to go elsewhere
12050200	12058440	Will the member streams be archived? I may not be able to tune in. I'm not gonna try and get them banned. No, I think we'll be okay
12060200	12062200	We're gonna use our euphemisms
12063800	12065800	Where I go tentacle and ink
12066840	12068440	And I want to
12068440	12070440	Ink on the tentacle
12072280	12074280	Because we're cut off fish out here
12075000	12077000	We're cephalopods
12077000	12083000	But together we're a cephalopog because we're so cool like that. Yeah pogger
12085080	12087080	Um
12087080	12093320	Have I ever heard about the gates by ass rock? I'm so sorry. I've never heard of that in my life
12093480	12095480	We're all stuck in perigatory
12095800	12097800	Keep that in mind
12098120	12106120	Because there may or may not be a collab with a va and all viola members that is related to purgatory. So keep that in mind
12107960	12110440	Uh, funny you brought a funny you brought that up. Yeah
12111800	12119720	Um, imagine pieta, but it's the virgin mary given jesus. Whoa. We we can't be saying that stuff out loud
12119880	12121880	That's those are inside thoughts
12123960	12125960	Oh sense interesting. Yeah
12126920	12128920	You better be excited
12129800	12133640	I like when strony spoils. I try my best. I do
12134200	12138600	I the dust is definitely settling on my list of stuff to do
12139400	12143240	Like a lot of things are becoming a lot easier. Um
12144680	12149640	And it's getting to the point where I can fully be strummer. Yes, I can be strummer. Um
12151880	12153400	I
12153400	12157240	I wouldn't mind having a clip manager, but sadly, um
12158680	12160840	I don't have anyone. Um
12162920	12165000	I trust to be in that position
12166360	12167640	Um
12167640	12173560	Because clip manager needs access to the girls accounts to see what people have been clipping and it ain't gonna happen
12173800	12174600	so
12174600	12178200	Unfortunately, I am still clip manager at this point in time
12178360	12182600	But it's not too bad because literally I just take a clip and then I send it to editor and then editor comes back
12182680	12186920	And then I upload it on girls channel and it's all hunky dory. It's not a problem
12188920	12192760	Strummer I like when strony you didn't finish your sentence
12196280	12202840	Mummy protecting her doors. Yes. Um, I will be your shield. I know not a lot you play overwatch
12202920	12206600	I used to play it quite a lot. Sadly, I fell out of love with it. Um
12207160	12212200	When overwatch 2 came out, but there is a girl called
12214280	12219240	Brigitte Lenthal and her slogan is I will be your shield
12220120	12223320	And yes, I am Brigitte for my gen mates
12223960	12226840	Because I don't want anything happening to them
12227560	12229080	and
12229080	12231400	So I'm the I am both the owl and the shield
12231800	12235560	I love when strony does anything
12236600	12241560	Yes, uh tomorrow's stream. I'm gonna see if I can get my heart rate monitor working. Um
12242840	12243960	So
12243960	12246520	I should be able to do that
12247320	12250200	And then you can see my heart rate during buckshot roulette
12250760	12255480	I didn't manage to watch any more baltral content because I literally I finished stream
12256280	12260680	I did I see an emmy's memberships and then
12261480	12265320	Then what would I do? I don't know. Um, and then I went on twitter
12265400	12269320	I think I liked one thing and then passed out and then I woke up like
12270920	12272920	45 minutes before stream
12273400	12279560	I probably needed a big sleep like that. Like it was coming. It was coming that I needed a sleep like that
12281240	12284040	Strony that was the whole sentence. Wait, what was the sentence?
12285640	12287640	That's the whole sentence
12288200	12290920	I also like when strony I do like when strony
12291480	12293480	But why are clips private?
12294120	12299000	I don't know youtube doesn't let people see what people have clipped on
12300120	12302360	live stream or any content really
12303160	12310520	If it was public then I could get a clip master, but I can't get a clip master because they're not public
12311400	12317560	But hopefully youtube changes that in a couple of months because that would then negate me even needing to
12317640	12322520	Be a clip master. Um, and then I can spend even more time
12323640	12325640	We're briefly wait. They're not
12326200	12335560	Do you remember sending marshmallows to the girls? I remember completely crashing on yesterday's stream for anyone who wasn't watching the runescape stream
12336360	12338840	I hit the 11 hour mark and became
12339560	12346280	Delirious I spilled all my chips on the floor when I ended stream and I just left them until this morning to clean up
12347640	12351000	I was gone with the wind. I
12351960	12359080	I don't know what happened. I ate food and I was like, oh, this will wake me up. This will wake me up. No, it freaking didn't
12359960	12360840	day
12360840	12364840	One day we'll hit 12 hours for old school runescape. Honestly
12365720	12367720	um
12367720	12369720	No, I didn't have any issues with the
12370360	12374200	Playing it but I like completely crashed the ending of the stream was so funny
12374600	12378360	I just remember being like, oh, let me send the girl some marshmallows
12378440	12383160	And then I started typing and I don't really remember what the contents of it were but hopefully
12384040	12386040	All is good. Um
12386760	12388760	But yeah, I remember just
12389080	12391080	Freaking losing it basically
12391560	12393480	I crashed way before that part of stream
12393960	12398280	You used up all your energy trying to win connect for unironically. Oh my god
12398520	12403800	If you didn't see runescape stream quick recap in runescape, you can play connect for
12404360	12406120	I was getting
12406120	12407640	decimated
12407640	12408760	like
12408760	12411960	The reeflings were like ganging up on me just
12412440	12419480	Fucking one at a time one after the other like bro. I just accepted my fate. I could not win at connect for
12420040	12424440	One I won one because I tried so hard and burnt my brain
12425160	12429720	The second one I won by accident because a reefling couldn't see what I was doing
12430200	12433320	Um, I was gonna absolutely destroy
12434040	12437880	Yeah, I remember my sleep fading and then some strange noises coming up
12438760	12440040	Um
12440040	12443160	It sounds like a fun time bro. I was perishing
12443800	12448840	I don't know what happened because normally I can last 12 hours and I had an eight hour sleep before it
12448840	12455240	But my brain oh my stomach just made a noise if you heard that my brain just perished like it had enough
12455320	12457320	It was like, I'm sorry. I can't hold out anymore
12458280	12463880	Checkers. Oh, no, I'm not playing checkers again. That was the most confusing thing. I couldn't even bro
12464200	12467960	We were playing checkers and I couldn't even move on the board
12468520	12472200	Because I didn't know what was like going on
12473080	12477080	Um with the dang thing. It was a redonkula. Hold on
12477880	12482680	Uh, I'm just gonna pin the marshmallow. Oh my god. That's me. That sounds like that
12483560	12485560	Q and a
12486440	12488760	I say q and a is if we don't just like
12489960	12494760	That's not the q and a length. Hold on a minute. That's the that's what the reefling said
12495960	12501640	Wait a minute. Who are you? I need to draw any cuttles. There we go. That's one
12503400	12506280	Bit of q and a q
12507160	12509160	and
12509480	12511000	Boom
12511000	12517160	Uh, it's not really a q and a is it just you guys being lovely to me and then I go in a ramble and I see how lovely

12529960	12535880	I fell asleep to your stream and my brother was very much questioning what on earth you were watching when you woke up
12536120	12538120	Just me raging
12539400	12544200	I choked on my burrito rage and actually which was that makes it like 10 times funnier
12545400	12547400	so

12587800	12593640	How do you feel about the dragon age games? Particularly the upcoming veil guard game? Um
12595240	12599960	I've never played a dragon quest game properly. Sorry a dragon age game properly
12600440	12606040	Uh, I played the one where brother and sister and then brother like immediately. Well, I said for the brother or die
12606280	12610440	I think I played it for like 30 minutes and I was like, oh this ain't for me
12612200	12618040	Um, but there seems to be quite a lot of fans that are distraught at the reveal because they don't like it
12618200	12620200	but I thought it was just uh
12620280	12622920	I think why do we hate brazil? No, it's a meme
12623560	12628600	Where it's like, oh come to brazil do a concert in brazil, but brazil's really dangerous for foreigners
12629080	12631080	We don't actually hate brazil
12632280	12636760	Hi stronti, I agree with that one riff riefling when you rage. I always think of you
12637720	12639720	pinning me down and having your
12640040	12641880	your way with me
12641880	12646280	And then not stopping even when I finish. Oh my god, rieflings. This is good
12647240	12649640	I don't think we could say any of this out loud
12651320	12657560	What if I'm here because I was hypnotized by a moment. Maybe the hypnosis is listening up. We should hypnotize more
12658680	12661400	Not yet. You have to wait. You have to wait
12662280	12664280	soon
12664280	12666280	It's overtism
12666360	12668360	We're hitting overdrive
12669160	12671880	What was that stream song overdrive?
12672360	12674200	Burning machine
12674200	12676440	Oh brain power. That's it brain power
12682120	12686920	How did you decide which of the generation one models were going to be used?
12687400	12692600	Where are there other people auditioning for stronti? No, um, if you weren't there at the start development
12693080	12696600	All six models were laid out on the website under the auditions page
12697160	12703800	Uh, I was codename inks and it said I am a pre-selected talent, but please apply to be my gen mate
12704440	12707400	Uh, no one could apply for stronti because I'm stronti
12708280	12711960	There is only gonna be one stronti. You can't you can't get better than me. Okay
12713960	12715960	Uh, welcome to the danger zone
12717320	12719320	Ora ora
12719560	12721560	Um, as for who did I pick?
12722040	12723240	uh
12723240	12725000	The models for
12725000	12730680	I did take into account what the girls went for but when I heard the girls
12731080	12738280	Voices it pretty much instantly my brain went oh, okay. That's gonna be enemy. Oh, okay. That's definitely I say oh, okay
12738280	12741640	That's mercy. Oh, that's our genre. Oh, that's she be um
12743240	12749800	Because I got to hear them talk in general in the introduction introduce yourself video
12750200	12753560	And they gave me a good indication of personality type and all that so
12754200	12759000	If anyone wants to complain you you hired wrong you put someone on the wrong shot
12760840	12762840	shot
12763080	12764760	Don't want to hear it

12766440	12772040	Uh for a siren that can't sing you just need to ramble and yap and I'll follow you under the waves
12772520	12774520	I don't actually want you to perish
12775080	12777720	It was the concept artist that gave me that lore
12778760	12780760	I don't want anyone to perish
12781480	12783800	Hmm. Can you say shut one word to shut?
12787720	12789720	And you put the girl on the right shot
12791000	12793000	Don't want to hear it

12827000	12829000	I'm gonna put you
12830760	12833400	Seven days no ink help, please
12834440	12836440	How has it been so long?
12837640	12839640	I say that as if I'm not
12840600	12842600	Backed up but
12843160	12845160	How what do you mean help?
12846120	12848120	Help

12854840	12856840	Is that what you need?
12858120	12862920	I don't know what help you need you didn't specify you got to specify or I'm not gonna come up with that one
12863880	12870680	Hi, strongy. Are there any talents of corpus you'd like you'd like or veal or to collab within the future
12871320	12875480	Hey, I'm humping you me plus and I'm humping v and you because they were lovely
12877240	12881400	Mythos tal hq were very receptive to us as well
12881560	12883720	Sadly due to timing couldn't do the watch longs
12883720	12889000	But mythos talents seem to be kind of already leaning on the alternative side
12889000	12892280	Which makes me quite comfortable with them as creators
12893320	12895320	As for actual corporation
12895800	12897560	tubers
12897560	12903960	Uh, I'm just if the person's happy with me. I'm happy with them. I never want to encroach myself on someone
12904520	12905800	That's not the word at all
12905800	12912520	I agree with those other two reef flings need mommy to take all that rage out of my tentacle until it's ink to dry. Oh my god
12915240	12916440	Um

12952200	12957240	It took me a year to cook veiler. Give me. I needed to be in the kitchen. I'm not the best at it
12957240	12959240	I'm level 76 right now, but
12959880	12961880	It takes it takes a long time. Um
12962840	12965400	So I was working hard or hardly working, you know

13071640	13075240	Use a figurine on me
13077000	13079880	For me you'd let me do that
13081560	13085320	Okay, October 10th is my birthday. So make sure you're all
13086760	13090760	Ready for what happens on October 10th

13114040	13116040	Um, I do
13116040	13118040	Ah, what's that game?
13118840	13121480	It's hard because there's not a lot of six man games
13121480	13126680	So I think it might have to be stuff like among us or lethal company. I know
13127320	13131960	Residency for everyone plays it but the problem is there's six of us. There were many
13132040	13135320	I think there's a back rooms game that we can play together possibly
13136040	13139800	Um, I do want to do monthly six man collabs
13140280	13144840	Uh, but after that, um, it will be like two on two collabs. Maybe three three collabs
13145560	13150600	Angry scottish drunk karaoke wins soon. I was gonna do a drunk karaoke
13153640	13158120	On um, I don't know when yeah, I don't know when um
13159320	13161000	But I was gonna do it on a weekend

13169480	13171480	When the talents are so
13172040	13176440	Jackbox would be great, but just with only one pop so you don't have to stream discord
13177000	13179960	Yes, I am open to doing that. Um she be
13180600	13183000	When we were first meeting for the first time
13183080	13188040	I got the girls to play a game together and we played jackbox and we all got addicted and we're like stuck
13188120	13191720	I was like because it was only supposed to be like a one hour icebreaker
13191720	13195560	So the girls could get used to like each other because like from my pov
13195640	13199480	I knew the girls like I had consumed their content. I knew kind of about them who they are
13199880	13201880	How they kind of are and all that jazz
13202360	13206440	Um, and then we ended up playing for like two hours and I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry
13206600	13210040	Like I didn't mean to steal all the time, but then like I went two hours and a half
13210680	13211880	um
13211880	13217160	In poor ac's tame zone. I picked a really bad tame zone. So she was so tired, but she was having so much fun
13217240	13219240	She didn't want to get off
13219240	13221240	Um, which was so cute
13221320	13225400	Then cute and good, which says cute. So if you put it dictionary
13226120	13228600	Oh, we we're gonna possibly do a dictionary

13233400	13237480	Okay, I was gonna say I'm not sure we can hmm, but we had fun on jackbox
13237880	13242680	It was so mean against ac though because english isn't her first language
13243240	13247720	And one of the game modes was like asking all these really like hard questions
13247800	13254360	Like even english speakers can't get it. I felt so bad for her and she kept like dying in the game. I felt so bad
13255640	13260680	Um, I say not one to get off. That's definitely not true. Whoa. Did I say that sentence?

13648920	13653240	I'm staying away from the permanent stuff because it makes me a bit nervous doing any permanent effects stuff
13653320	13656200	But I already have a public release audio
13656760	13663080	That will undo any effects. I may or may not do on you. What did you ask me in particular reinforcement loop for triggers?

13713640	13715640	Figurines
13716600	13718600	Ah

13724520	13728600	I like the transparency though because you're just a normal person at the end of the day
13728920	13733960	Yeah, actually, can I say something that's really disrespectful and I mean no disrespect when I say it
13734600	13741960	You know those v-tubers that have those donations where like items get thrown at the v-tuber model when they get a donation
13742520	13744520	and then the v-tuber goes like
13747240	13750280	The the every time I consume any of that
13751240	13754600	I this is very disrespectful and I don't mean it this way
13754680	13757640	It makes me cringe to think that they're in a room
13758280	13761880	On their own with the iphone tracking them and going
13765320	13767000	I'm so sorry
13767000	13769000	I'm like actually so sorry
13769480	13770600	for me

13771960	13773080	It's a no
13773080	13778680	But people find it entertaining which is really cute. I like that people can get so entertained and so
13779480	13781480	Enveloped
13781720	13785400	That it's humorous. So I do apologize to anyone that I may have
13786200	13788200	Uh, thank you. Yeah, I've seen it too
13789560	13792440	Twitch integrated throwing system. Oh, okay. Is that what it's called?
13793400	13798200	And yeah, and here you are velour figures that well adjusted people can be normal
13800200	13805240	Don't think about it harder. It makes the cringe. Yeah, I remember seeing a clip about it and I was like
13805880	13809800	Don't get me wrong. I'm a cringe fest if you sit through one stream of mine
13810600	13817000	But I remember seeing it and I was like, oh, that's rough. That's rough even for me to digest
13818600	13823000	But I mean absolutely no disrespect when I say that like whatever works for you works for you
13823560	13825240	some people are
13825240	13828280	Balls to the wall in immersion and that's fantastic
13828840	13833880	For me, um, I am absolutely in love that reeflings are in love with pilot in America
13834200	13836200	It makes me incredibly comfortable
13836680	13838120	I'm
13838120	13843000	Like streaming and acknowledging like oh, I need to only go put my emotes on
13843640	13845640	Instead of like being like
13845640	13847640	I love you so much
13848840	13849800	Like
13849800	13855400	Bro, ain't no one here for that. Well, some people might be here for that but me. I'm not here for that, you know
13857000	13859000	Um
13859960	13862120	Yeah, it's basically just beautiful
13862760	13867800	But I don't mind like the roleplay like if I had a 3d model or I'll be roleplaying at the wazoo
13867880	13873320	So I'm probably gonna be hypocritical with that statement. It's not even a statement. It's just me blabbering
13873880	13879240	Any blabberers the heart eyes. Yeah, I love that my heart eyes are so different
13879400	13885000	Like, oh my god, my squiddles. Where'd my squiddly pupils go? Give me my squiddly pupils back
