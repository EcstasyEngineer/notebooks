{"text": " What's that? Hold on, hold on, you put the light onto the fucking tracking thing. Ah, it's blinding! It's blinding, it's looking good. Me? Hmm, why do I need to wear glasses? Also me, because blasted. About, like, one minute late, she hates us. You stop that, you naughty Nellie. You naughty soft fans. You naughty ballbags. I actually don't say that word, that's fine. Well, I mean, that's another word. Uh... Um... Are we here? Hello? Hello? Hi! Hello America! Hiya! Hiya! Oh my god, what's that? We get to do another full day of Assassin's Creed. And I get to, yeah, ease as much as I like. Uh, I do want to say I am very thankful to PayPal support. Yay! PayPal unblocked this. Because if you didn't know, yesterday, you guys unanimously, at the same time, supported, like, everyone with donos. And PayPal was like, halt, halt. This account has been paused because what on earth are all these things? And we literally had to go, oh, hello there PayPal. Uh, we're streaming. Uh, we're beach homers. Please unblock. So you can support my daughters. Uh... Good morning! Good evening! And most of all, good afternoon reeflings! Are you ready to fuck up your sleep pattern? Do do d, d, d, d, d, d, d. Do, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, dd, dd, d,d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, dd, d, dd, d, dd, d, d, d, d, d, d, dd, How are you? And you did? It was Aisy looking after you. Did anyone touch your tummy? Don't lie, Aisy's best design element is her tummy, her navel. If you didn't know, a belly button is also a refer to as a navel. I understand you can't hear the background music, oh I've seen some creepy brotherhood right now. Ask that memean, erm. I apologise for being a whole 60 seconds late. Do you want to know why I'm 60 seconds late? Cos I was trying to arrange another Ace Markalab. Um, I've recorded one with Mimosa, I need to edit it. I do not know how long today's stream is gonna be, so feel free to strap in. And if not, I'll be the one wearing the strap in this relationship. Ah, that's terrible, absolutely terrible, just started. Erm, but it's been fantastic. I should hopefully not miss any freaking donations. Like I did yesterday, cos I was absolutely awful. I just kept missing everything left and right. Everything left and right. Left and right. Oh, that's not how I can read. Okay, there we go. Woo, five hours of sleeping, eight hours of work, and we're so bad. Oh, please rest, okay. I can, I literally, I brushed my teeth, I had a shower. Right, well I'll tell you something gross whilst we jump back into the action. I'll tell you something nasty. Why can I not hear my game? Hello? Headset? Headset? Headset, I know there's, hello? Okay, I cannot hear any sound and the game isn't coming out of my fucking desktop. Are you fucking serious? By the way, this game lives up to the test of time. Are we being true? Why is it not coming out of desktop? Is this a fucking joke? How could this have been so scuffed? I can't hear the game either. Okay, fantastic. Fantastic! No, seriously. The tips link is messed up again. Are you joking? God, I'm so scuffed. Um... I am speechless on why the game is not playing through the desktop audio right now. Hold on, let me start clicking stuff and see what happens. Okay, I need to start clicking stuff. Why would the game not be detectable via the desktop audio? I am totally not raging right now. Let's check, let's check. Right, okay, okay, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me click. Rule one, if something doesn't work, close the game and open it again. Because why would it not be detectable on desktop? That's rule one of gaming. Okay, so I've closed it. It's now closed, you can't see none of it. Also, I listened back. I was watching a bit of my own brotherhood gameplay. My voice actually doesn't sound that messed up, but I can hear it and feel it myself how messed up it is. Yep, again, no audio. If I have to go offline to troubleshoot this, I'm gonna be so mad. Why? I didn't do anything. I, Mercy, has literally made a short about this exact scenario. I cannot make this up. Mercy has a short coming out later about this exact situation. Game, audio output settings, hold on, hold on, hold on, manage input devices, output devices, sound mixer, is it sound mixer? Input, yep, output, yep. Why the frick? Why the frick fracked Italy deck, tic-tac, petty whack? Would this not be coming out? I think I actually have to go offline to frickin' jumpshoot this. I'm not even kidding. I can't believe this. Are you joking? It only took me seven minutes to start the stream! Oh, 49% total synchronization. Oh, I guess we are doing 12 hours then if I'm only at 49%. Let's go. Literally, Mercy made a short about this. I cannot wait for the short to come out so you guys can be like, oh my god. Oh my god, she was right. If you are not up to scratch, please do not worry because we have successfully finished campaign mode. We are currently playing Landlord Simulator 2 by all of the buildings at the moment. We are now doing the kind of side quest-esque missions. We are about to do a very sad mission for the auditory family. Me, I'm still here. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. I hope all is good. I believe Asakul is the only other member live at this moment. But as always, when another member goes live, I will force you to go insane to her stream. Okay, here we go. I do not normally do this so I'm not too familiar with what happens next. I think Asi is going offline. That's Leonardo. That's Leonardo's voice. Desmond's heart rate is increasing. I'm administering a sedative. No, the missing data may be there. The piece of Eden is useless until we have- Oh, I don't remember much of this. Yes, William. Yes, William, congrats if your name's William. Any Williams in her? Eh? Eh? The Da Vinci- Eh, Da Vinci- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. The Da Vinci Disappearance. Did you know? I remember. Leonardo. Good friend. Thank you. I see you're reading Super Chess at the moment. Wait, she got monetized? She couldn't have. I didn't link that. Did you mean Donation? No, they were doing- I was gonna say. None of us have monetization here. Uh, I think one of my assassins came back for success. We're from a mission. It's gonna be da Mona Lisa. And that smile. Overdone. I'm so sorry, AC, I never managed to catch any of the- Snowberries! Any snowberries? Hi, Snowberries! He's a part of the campaign. Get raided, get raided, get raided! Get plopped, get plopped, get plopped. Are you squidding me right now? Ah, thank you for the 20. Bajinga, what the fuck? There's no way that says Bajinga. Did I read that right? I read it in the top corner. Thank you Bajinga for the- What? You didn't even leave a message! Why are you called Bajinga? Oh, now I can't read chat. Oh god, I'm so brain dead. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Bajinga? Bajinga? Good morning. I'm glad you like icicles. Ah, it's the woman. Did you see the guitar AC design? No, I didn't manage to catch her stream. I was uploading everyone's Patreon audios. Did you know? Honestly, me is real. I'm good to go. She designed one for everyone. Oh, I need to watch that VOD then. No, no, there's not new audios on Patreon. Sorry, I scheduled up everyone's Patreon audios. I'm really struggling to know how to tag though. If you didn't know. Of men? You worship their misery? No, mate. I actually prefer holes and no poles. Then he's swinging that way, but I actually need nothing against a mate. Wait, is this DLC? Yeah, I think so. My main quest stuff, this is side stuff. Okay, ready to kill. No reactive model today? I never put it on. I've got this though. That's if I make a joke, I can do that. Oh, oh, oh, oh, combat. Hold on, hold on, get the wee knife out. And let them attack you. Oh, I can call them assassins. So if I make a pun that I like, I can literally do that. Okay, the assassins on the horse, I'm happy. Can you get off the horses? Oh, that was brutal. You can attack me then. Whoa, I missed that. Okay, there we go. Please, God, do that. It's hilarious. Yeah, so if I come up with a really good pun, all you're going to hear is that all day long. Right away. Casually kills a dozen people. Zoom, my man. Apologize. Any apologizers? Me, man, let me burp. No, sorry, let me raid the horse. Geez, I didn't mean to say that. Literally what I was about to do. Why is he running? Why you won't? I drink honey tea. I have a lovely honey tea. Just for me. Some honey tea. And a game full of nostalgia. And I'll play and ramble all day. So I can enjoy the game with you. I'm not even, I don't know what the tone of the song is after that come with me. Yeah, there you go. Wait, so what are you? I am a cuttlefish. I'm a siren and a cuttlefish. But the problem with being a siren is I can't sing. I can't lie on my hypnotic abilities to steal the hearts of men and then perish them in the war. I did not make my lore, by the way. But in terms of who's the most evil out of all of us in Vealor, I'm pretty evil. Then it goes Emi, but Emi isn't inherently evil. She just really wants her brother back and she does stuff to entertain herself. Okay? I drink some tea, so if I start hypnotizing it's because I'm drinking tea. I would, oh you'd perish in my water, willing? Follow me! We are following the leader the leader trailing behind the leader going ahead of the leader the leader the leader oops oops I don't think I'm supposed to be at this section because they could spot me a mile away but hey ho somehow things work out in the end. It speaks volumes about Vealor but the most evil person is not the goat goddess but the fish. No! Azura created you she's your literal mother she created humanity as we know it. Like so Azura is like the kindest Mercy's just misdirected, okay? Mercy's just misdirected, okay? Mercy's just misdirected, okay? She just doesn't understand because she does genuinely love but sometimes that love results in your expiration date which is a shame but she doesn't mean it, okay? She's wholesome She's like a dark yandere She lures your guard and then before you know it the finishing act the guard will discover and then, yeah he found the entrance to a temple oh we're learning about catcomes that we can go in oh this is the DLC called Leonardo's Diaries I just remember that literally right now I thought it was an auditory something discovered by some scholar from Lechia in fact taste my blade taste my oh no we're just for size oh I got double ear assassins Rick, wait I'm going to take a quick drink of my tea, I apologize don't like her to see views, I'll just part of her plan to lure her in to her watery graves, oh my god that was such a hard word to say watery graves watery graves terrible, here again we are jumping into the DLCs of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, we've finished the main quest we are going to try and 100% this bad boy I think I can do it, I have no idea I did not look up what the tank mission is so I'm getting scurred DLCs delicious not neutral, well maybe mainly a honey is very good for avoiding illness put antelab and take back cereal sorry that guy's talking at the same time and it makes it hard to talk and think wow, AI I'm a beautiful fish oh we should watch that movie that the song is like I'm a little little fish in the deep blue sea somebody help me no help no help whoa whoa whoa I've gone too far I'm about to desync oh no they're just walking past walk on the high out my way out my way I'm on the floor no help strong evil intentions through kind acts Amy kind intentions through evil basically Amy just wants her brother back and she kind of has a bit of fun with the spells really that's how she was contemplated oh the young Leonardo the temple he discovered where is it Leonardo Salahi you want to save and tell me where the temple is I do not know cazzo etcher something is written on the floor what does it say I cannot read Leonardo but now painting he wants us to examine art I remember when Leonardo

any of that put Leonardo has been yoinked and he discovered some sort of advanced advantageous things that would pardon me excuse me come through I was reading chat excuse me excuse me sir have you heard about this have you seen this about chat oh my god slay them right now yeah slay them my deans and then I'll do the rest of the work okay I got you covered baby baby oh Catherine Christina is coming up alright we'll do Christina okay so basically we stalked her home and then we got a kiss so surely this isn't going to get weird any further reading chat obviously was a mistake to do I know literally doing it like in a game is so hard let strongy lead my pleasure I remember that I was a bit sus I have to admit it's you now we the girls can do it to you that's fine yeah that's fine other way around Christina we're in Farenzy oh this is so sad oh this is so sad in Assassin's Creed 2 your family get hung due to treachery this is really sad this I don't like this one this is pretty freaking sad honestly I can't remember the past though this is very sad so the girls yeah yeah so we can do it to you but you're not allowed to do it to us come here you fanny oh I missed that was really embarrassing actually imagine someone coming to punch I did it again I'm like punching the air this can't be one air that's going on with him Assassin's Creed 2 is actually very beautiful considering how old it is I don't want to speak because I don't know for a fact this might genuinely be the imported map from Assassin's Creed 2 where the heck am I trying to go swinging it his family's to be honest it was his first day I don't know unquestioning me that's a very hard word that's a big word for strongy right if I remember correctly I can just do this and there's one patrolling guard that will desync you if you're not aw he's up there I can see him aw this is so sad this is literally the bodies of my frickin family aww I desynced already wait am I not to kill these people wait dad desync if I kill them Chris without killing any right how did I do that wait he perished because he went in the water come in the water good boy be a good boy you love water don't you you love it into the water come on there's a good boy that wants to come in the water yes no jump in the water oh wait can I knock him out does it count if I knock you out let me knock you out boom get in the water yeah good boy get in the water right in the water you too you're next in the water don't be throwing rocks at me that's no nice ha ha ha ha get pulled get pulled in the water go good boy in the water you go okay we did it we did it okay now back to the sad part this is my big brother and yeah honestly it's pretty messed up all things considered put me down there oh his his body just kind of ragdoll and it's still leaving their deaths to fate once again bro literally oh no this was your wee brother it was actually so freaking sad in Assassin's Creed 2 so your mother Maria she doesn't talk until you collect 100 feathers because Pietro the wee little brother was collecting feathers and once you collect all 100 feathers she finally speaks her first words after the death of everyone and it's just like a freaking sad thing genuinely and then this is your dad oh it was so sad literally so freaking sad yeah the feather quest that's why there's 10 feathers in this game I guess it's in memoria oh me actually so sad she doesn't ah she doesn't come with those in Christina's Etsy was like true love and then so sad she's feeding corpses to the fishes oh that's true and there was no in-game map for the feathers do you want to hear the worst part about the feather quest in Assassin's Creed 2 so my Xbox was in a different room from where the computer was in my house so I would have to scurry to the living room and memorise a location of a feather and then scurry back through to my Xbox as a child my mum was like what on earth are you doing I'm getting worried about you and I was like the feathers mum the feathers I need the feathers what do you need the feathers for I was like scurry and back and forth like all of that and I did it once I've never done it again but we'll probably try and do it when we play AC 2 these are DLC I allegedly like so the way I memorised things I don't have a very good like brain so I had to open my eyes really wait and oh it's the crit sale wow wow so after chaseries date with bait the crit sale got married off and Chanel is on the countryside and hiding but yeah I used to like have to in order to memorise stuff I had to open my eyes really which I know seems bizarre but it's the only way I could do it I just had to go like oh and then like I wouldn't blink and then I'd run to the Xbox and like where the location was it sounds really dumb now that I'm saying it out loud but it was the only way I could do it like the like phones weren't like well I didn't have a phone it was because I was a child and like yeah phones weren't like that um wee this is really dangerous because I actually don't know which way okay okay that was lucky eyes wide must take all information I was literally like sorry can't speak don't talk to me and then I'd get another feather and then come back through and look at the next one and if you like pick up feathers on the way it actually makes it a bit harder where is that heck am I supposed to go there are guards everywhere Lecretia is is that just a straight jump I think so okay you don't hear a grown man fall into here literally oh my back yeah yeah you don't remember which feathers you pick up along the way so it makes it even harder because if you go to the area you think it was that um sorry I got nervous I'm about to go the wrong way I can reach that jeez Skyrim logic best logic sorry is there I think no there can't be flags on the DLC that's not allowed wow that camera angle change sheee wee although I will say one thing about this DLC this is so satisfying because um you really won't get caught by the guards doing this you can literally parkour your way through it and the guards don't actually catch you which I see is very satisfying gameplay wise but it's satisfying yes um I do like the idea of like it's he'll be able to like completely sneak undetected without the fear of being detectives wee oh my god ugh I have terrible news aren't you pee already um yeah like see I love this this is like so satisfying like I'm just quietly sneaking around ooh we're in the gardens of whatever that goddess name is and I've already forgotten what the garden's called okay this is the bit where you can lose I think right you can't climb the hedge I guess okay as if they don't hear me fucking what was that supposed to do there I have no idea oh I just went for it they are so dead honestly this outfit they're gonna kill me a nice gentle or should I say a borrowed title bestowed by my husband ill-fitting and barely concealing the truth you can keep your life I am here for the art on your walls I'm redecorating are we I'll redecorate that win I'm sorry if only it were that easy my birth place she is home and you like her haze I do not believe you frightening is it not you have lost so much perhaps we can comfort you we are really a ladies man where are the paintings sold to Francesco Colonna and one to someone who was special to me patricio he spends his time near ilvatica not gonna lie reflin if you did that to me Edmill give it to me guards place the winch's in a cart leave it outside the walls no no gobbene now close your eyes I don't remember what's happening there's no way we killed her brother and forgive me to Kessa what for no man can heal your pain you must do so on your own no we won the scene say hello to the duke for me guards see all you had to do was put your pole in the hole and now the guards are on us it's so it was that simple come on you heard that doctor at the start there's a cure for syphilis I don't know where to go this is the most logical reason because why would you put the stairs at 12 o'clock I don't know where to go there's a timer there's so many guards inside ok ok ok across the chandelier unfortunately don't look down ok sorry I cannot reach I'm getting stressed there's a freaking timer ok and then we and then run across ok we can do it come on I say scared oh sorry I didn't mean to whistle I just whistled because I was breathing with the small mouth my pardon your pardon I beg I don't say my pardon you beg but you don't need to ask me oh did we do it? I was actually really quick 1 out of 5 paintings ok we nailed that we nailed that we absolutely nailed that who's pardon now that was scary but we did it only 1 minute and 57 seconds is fair ok that went so well honestly can you distract on a horse can you distract with me wait whoa whoa whoa camera angle relax relax this is terrible but can I go for a pee already I need to tinkle my winkle please get up and stretch and get a thingy I actually generally pee it's like so quick but I just noticed it and now I'm like ok I'll literally be a minute stretch your legs and get a war oh I have a war already so I don't need anymore I'll be 2 minutes ok oh I'll just smash my cheek off if you hear that ok ok ok ok ok I'm so sorry I'm so sorry to do a pee break so quick it's a shame normally I'm more organized I do apologize I was a bit scarabrained this morning I like put up so Shibi as much as we meme about Shibi's concept art of her looking like a horse she is a work horse she's already got like 2 months of audios like scheduled up and I was like dealing with all of that so I'm taking painkillers oh uh tummy hurt on ironically ah um uh and then I had to record I could you know I recorded like a really quick ASMR audio like 2 minutes before the stream where do we post art on Twitter ok I'm just taking some war I still think I can like 100% this game um unfortunately oh right ok let's see what we're working with here we've got 30 thousand hmm it's not really enough to invest in a landmark at the moment we'll keep doing the Leonardo DLC I will say one thing about the DLC

are behind guards can I climb that oh it's a three storey building though can I climb here I will climb this oh whoa I am sorry oh don't use the brief tops I am sorry how is that what is going on with

this part of the street am I going to run out of time because I can't see them out my way that was smoke bombed yourself out of a whole mission literally I cast evasion and I completely I roll the one how is this how is this such a rather confusing mission I have to admit I assume he is going to come out here so I am not going to I just want to look at him so I don't oh it's a bit too close for comfort I am a lady I like shopping hehehe I like getting my nails done hehehe make up make up make up boys boys that's terrible I am allowed to make these jokes though why is he coming backwards wait is he coming this way no no he is not coming this way jeez jeez you are scaring me so don't get detected oh you are so talented refling is looking cool look at that flexibility you will never guess what I can do with that I cast itchy that's a nasty one what is that a little brit what oh a little britain ref sorry what little brit I have already forgotten what I said going to be honest truth you are going to need to sub quote everything because I always forget what else I see okay okay oh I knew you were going to turn around that's right I got the eagle sense no okay he is going oh no okay okay okay let me get up this is like very close I wonder if they are going to turn him around again like they did earlier in that section because I am getting nervous I do not remember playing the DLC much pardon me excuse me oh we did it success cast your voice you will complete the sale of course hello hello the error lies in your spanish blood I know it such untruth you so casually utter based on little more than a name these countries these groups make such easy targets for the lazy and ignorant you should tell her that the high and mighty duquesa putana I have changed my mind that painting does not deserve to belong to anyone take the painting and examine it for clues be careful human hands aided by a fierce intelligence made that treat it with respect go he casted London experience no oh I am to destroy him refillings destroy that man what he is so fast how am I desyncing he is literally faster than the speed that I can run at I am not sure why the game is telling me careful you are desyncing get arrow stormed get arrow stormed you deserve it stinky leave the Vatican district working on there was a pole there that you could have grabbed to save the health of your ankles I am not going to take responsibility for you being sore that was point blank that was point blank no excuse I am trying to escape this district it puts you all the way into a certain section of the map by the way go all the way out of the section shake all about you do the hokie pokey and you run around and that is what it is all about hey that is green let's start watching I am suing viewer your pentas have you drawn your pentas a little too much the funniest thing I got a few maros I wouldn't say anyone was like disgruntled I think they were surprised so out of all the four audios for sheebie three of them are her in control and one of them is her not in the controlling position guess which one you all voted well the majority voted for the one where she was and then I got a few messages and I am like ah please I kind of maybe need to explain it a bit better we are working on making graphics so you know what content is coming up it just takes time we are settling into everything obviously emi got a warning recently in sheebie's lower video got 18 plus so I think we are actually debating about deleting it to try and ensure she gets monetization I would be mortified for the girls if they didn't get like they were rejected from youtube monetization because of me because member the girls didn't pick their designs and I would feel like so upset like don't get me wrong there's still stream elements, there's still patreon there's still tips on stream in general which is perfectly fine heck am I supposed to go but I would be mortified for the entire month for monetization streams all because I didn't think I had to get a toggle to cover up the cleavage hmm what do you normally need to do to get monetized 500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours but your channel can still be rejected which is understandable they need to go through the content but I'm hoping all things considered if the girls are sitting doing game streams and all of that it's just another they're just gamers pass it on obviously before we could launch I could only spell out so much don't be silly of course the girls aren't going to be am I not to be detected don't detect me I'm scared get in here who dares approach the veil of hey right we're just going to go for it cause there's no need to assume we can just run right those guys are bugged out cause that guy literally couldn't give a left boot crack ooh I'm going to hurt my ankles thank goodness we have the armor cause yeah I'm just going to run for the objective there's no point to stopping and fight cause it's one of those ones where they just keep spawning in with more guys and it's just a waste of time we're trying at 100% this I say that as if we don't have to redo all of this again probably to get 100% I actually don't know what oh no 100% was don't be detected or something that is impossible if they're going to just constantly spam enemies may I sit on the bench please oh it's him he was rude to

I can't handle this All right, she's a wee bit of a slag, but it's fine Wait, it feels really not going like I know like he never ended up with her because of revelations But why is this game so sad? Why can't it feel have a freaking happy ending? He tries so hard He's fine. He'll make a good husband I made sure oh What Even christina's confused It's you you're supposed to take her away. You're supposed to whisk her away Oh You're crying. I've got tears in my eyes. I'm just like can it's you have one like happy ending So I like I I'm really invested in it's your storyline I don't get it give this man catch a freaking break. Is that the end of christina's story? I don't see a broken heart on the map There is no way it ends there for chris christina I don't see a broken heart on the map That's it That's freaking it Oh You can't do this to me you be soft. Come on Oh for folks that we're gonna have to do the plane. I don't want war machines now No happy ending for the best character literally like There must have been more written I'm so sorry, but I do not believe for a moment the development team ended it there for christina Literally it's you saving him from gamble and going do you love her? Do you love her and then that's it? I do not believe one second the writers left it there If there isn't more it must have been cut because I refuse. I refuse. I refuse But it's you will have a hell of a happy ending. I can't remember what happens at the end of revolutions I really did not play it as much like I know he was sweet on a girl and then she got kidnapped But that's not the true love christina was Like Ah They saved it for the 20 bucks DLC honestly, isn't that song misery was I have no idea I just if it remain Never my intention to brag it was never my intention to mine. Oh, I can probably renovate this aqueduct while I'm at it I'm like right next to it I mean, I don't know I simply saw it it took revelation I Took revelation. Look to this one. He if you want the christeners, you just get somebody's I feel sinking There's more wait. What's her DNA sink? Uh 100 Oh, that's very low in the batter on the va right Oh total sink Oh Okay, okay. I get you come on. I get you come on right. We're gonna do Leonardo. I think that brings up her total sink surely No, it doesn't it didn't we were like unfortunate right hold on hold on we're steamrolling this right in memory We only have one thing we failed. Do not drop below his Huh Is this this one where they jumped me out of nowhere from around the corner Okay, okay, let's try again. Oh, we're going to shoot him for that deja vu. Okay. We need 75 percent sick We need more. I just felt like that was such a bizarre thing to end on I think it's when the guys jumped me I I can't skip this Didn't know you could do all this in a sense people Uh she be is alive by the way for anyone who you would like to watch her Modes you have permission to speak momentarily Oh the music. Oh, okay, let's just play it all over again. Why not? So good Oh Left of it since the borja came to power He cannot see it from here Well, I had to google why the Christina mission wouldn't show up in my game. So you're welcome. Oh, literally First and only girl in the series. I still doesn't realize literally Okay So someone said I didn't take the medicine like a dum-dum dummy dum-dum-dum Jeez. Oh wow because I'm Okay, I know I'm replaying it. I didn't know it did it like this. I like fully armored up fully healed up Uh, okay, I'll take it. I'll take it Oh Okay, let's do this the totality. Hello, mr. Doctor may I please have oh my arm I need to find a doctor you're 100 health mate It's just faking it. Literally. He just needs a bit. Honestly felt that I needed a bit attention I felt that But they have not proven effective against such things However, I can recommend several good colleagues around the city. Do you need anything else? No, sir. Thank you very much for your help Right checkpoint reach of north I think it was the guards a The guards hit me Remember when the guard hit me around that corner? I think this entire section is for that I don't have climbing gloves. Okay, so I don't have what abilities I don't have at that time Chad doctor not prescribing leeches, honestly Right Um Oh, what's my opinion on satan food? Hey It was a game. Yeah Okay, it must have been because they hit me around the corner when I wasn't expecting that Literally arrow storm would wait this Yeah, it was definitely because they hit me We'll try and finish Christina or maybe we should do Leonardo It would be nice to finish Christina, but then we're having like backtrack all this way Right, what weapons? Okay. I do have my fast knife. So hopefully none of them like fly out of the corner and attacked me because that was What happened the first time like they started attacking me way before we even got to the Gallo Which is where it's supposed to start. So I'll definitely hold back a bit more to be cautious Like I didn't dislike Assassin's Creed 3. Well I wouldn't play it on stream though. Like I definitely wouldn't be like as excited and happy and all of that and I Really love how forgiving the counter controls are in brotherhood In revelations, I think it's roughly the same Um, but in Assassin's Creed 3 onwards They like change the controls and I am definitely if it's not broke Don't fix it. And if you fixed it, it has now made like gameplay Frustrating like I really strongly dislike when gameplay gets interrupted because of like Oopsie. Whoopsie. You forgot to dodge this attack. So now you're desynced and you have to repeat this over and over and over again Uh, because we've changed the controls and we knew for a fact that the controls on brotherhood were received so well Because it's like our best well received game, you know, like that stuff just makes me perish Right, we're still gonna stay back. We're not quite at the gallows yet, but I don't want anyone reaching To attack me and I definitely have time to react if I've kind of got this distance on them Ah Sorry, excuse me. Pardon me come through All right, take your time. Actually I have smoke bombs. I'm wondering if that's probably the safest method maybe smoke bombing them If they turn on me Are we at the gallows yet? I'm like getting scared. I do not want to replay this If it's literally gonna be like this strike from okay here is where they kicked off I don't know if I should claim, you know that Whoa, that's okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay I have access to all my long range. I am using it Please citizen do not walk in front of the crossbow bolt my goodness Oh, wow, this is did I just Citizens, please do not walk in front of the crossbow ball. Okay. There we go done 100% Yeah Okay, this is so much easier. I did not realize we'd have access to the older weapons for this stuff as well This will make it easy That guy had a death wish literally like thank you for It's you did not kill civilians. Well because civilians certainly pop themselves off right. That's fine Uh double Oh, we've got one missing from this one as well Do not be detected while reducing to a right That's like super easy. Why have I failed these ones? Fake game are clearly Uh, right Oh, I need to do the whole thing over again. Oh, it's okay I'm surprised to see you 10 out of 10 reeflings recommend strong for this reason Was this the game that had the terror defense? No, that was revelations She was super excited and borrowing them to a barrel That man is a traitor to our order your character design romance of mesmer from subnautica Is there mpc's in subnautica?

Oh, I need a restock ammo Okay, I'm actually going to do the Pouch upgrades so we can like hold a lot of stuff because the pouches increase your ability to hold ammo like a lot more and It'll definitely help out in these kind of rewind situations Wait, you've never played subnautica? I don't remember. I think I've seen people play it. Which is why I say like I don't remember playing it um I'm in My tummy's wumbling. Okay. Okay. Okay after this one we go get food and fizzy juice Wow that would hurt We can play it together and stream as long as you guys hold my hands through subnautica because I have no concept for what to do My son Claudio has been injured they are going to shoot him Not if I shoot first get the others because I'm a I'm a quick shot I may not have an automatic, but I'll I'll do it anyway. Oh, whoa. Whoa. What are you doing? Yeah, yeah Whoa, they're like destroying him Oh Why are you just accepting gunshots? Oh, okay. We did it. We did it quick. I'd run the guards.

I'd like to see you son Oh, my tummy's really yumbling. Whoa. That was a good switcheroo words. My stomach is really rumbling Okay As soon as I notice it all of a sudden it's a big problem, but I don't notice it for like hours on end Are you sure you guys aren't the one hypnotizing me because I'm starting to feel like it is going that way It's single player. Oh, that sucks. It would be so fun to play There is a mod but I don't know if I need like Whoa, what's going on?

You're so satisfying to say no, all right No The gods are looking for your word. Good one. I see there's subnautica and subnautica below It would look into it and see which one Subnautica is easy when she spawn in just swim the deep part of the ocean Okay I've had it. Oh, I guess because I'm a colorful shed So straight down Right, don't be detected Stinky stinky me got detected Okay, there's no guards here. So I'm sick. Hello.

Sorry, you guys are distracting me. Stop being so entertaining Stop being so nice to me and gets me so distracted from the gameplay I've been told that I inherited my supposed to be very nice From my mother's side of the family. Oh, well, do you want to know? What's funny? My mummy has big bazongas Do you want to know what cup size my bazongas are? My mom's like freaking double g's or something And I'm a cups.

Stop she'll actually talk about it. She'll be like, I Just never grew anything um Like I remember when she got me a training bra Like so if you didn't know a training bra is like to get you used to wearing One because it's actually really uncomfortable. Like I know I know it doesn't sound like it's uncomfortable But like having something to strap down moving parts um, it's kind of cut I How much am I missing? Is that like less than 500 Florence roughly? Oh Um, and like she got me one and I was like mum. What is this for? And she was like, oh well I've got big gibbers. So you're gonna get big gibbers as well. And I'm like, um, okay So like I start training and then nothing happened Oh No, not like a sports bra like just like a thin fabric to like get you used to it and then yeah, none hand None hand with me But I'm not mad like I quite like my Uh aesthetic Some people like have struggles with their bodies, but I am really lucky because I I prefer being Uh, not having much up but having a lot down like I really like my body Yeah, like small buddies don't get in the way either Like all I hear like my mum will complain about like back pain and I'm like The only pain I get is like I don't get any pain because of my physique I would say that sorry. I'm trying to like think and do things at the same time and it's not working out. Um I would say like My physique just means like I'm always good to go basically Uh, right when we do another dna Do you know bro, but do you know? Okay, there's quite a lot. Um, oh Oh no, only two only two Castlecrasher, no, I don't want to do you the burdens we carry No, I don't want to do you either right. I'm gonna avoid any don't be I can do it in this one. I know how to do that one I So I just went on a massive ramble about that Milk milk and dump truck as I go. Oh mini milk is uh, yeah mini milk Oh, no, we don't have our assassin recruits But we should at this point Hmm It's going to be a bit painful At the meeting find them on the computer wait, where are you gonna get some food? Oh, I was Okay, we'll do it after this one. See you guys distracted me They alert You feed I forgot to get up Wait, I have one assassin recruit thing Is that because I only had one at the tank? Oh Oh, no, it's because they're all away on missions right now Okay, so if my assassins are way on missions, they're not available during recall that's Yeah, I understand that's probably like programming would have been a nightmare So, yeah, no, that makes sense. Okay. I won't send my recruits away too much anymore If that is the result I can send away the lower level ones because they do not count for the assassin signal I'm just gonna do this right now. I'm pretty sure it'll count towards my hiring the to lure the guards At the end of every week each one of us I'm starting to get lightheaded oopsies should have got some food Yeah, you put everyone else on quest literally I need to go around and find all these gestures. I don't know what happens at the end of the gesture Thing like they're getting money or just something happened Wait, is that senator? I'm wondering should I stall right now so all my recruits come back for this mission Right. Yes, we're going to do that. That's probably the best idea right now. So I don't mess up this mission I'm actually going to go out of range just so the event doesn't trigger and Please get off. There we go. We're just hiding here. Why not? I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to get a drink as well Oh, did you see that street performer fall over there? Oh dear I'm going to go for pee and please do get up and hydrate and stretch your legs Because we do not have hemorrhoids in the reefing gang Hey, I'll be back very shortly. Literally. I just need to like put it all in a bowl and then Uh, that's it really I don't recall if I need to do anything else Maybe make a hot water bottle because I'm a bit chilly Bit chilly. Right. I'll be I'll be like couple of minutes I would hide there He could be in here Hey, you'll need a beating Oh I think it's a good idea to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of of a little neutralization. Come on and play. You want to take a picture? Were we not in a haybill when I left? Am I going crazy? Did I not put myself in? Let's see if I can just go play on his own there. And break the fourth wall. My god, the shuby stream is hilarious. Hell yeah, it's how you go watch her. I could have sworn I was in that haybill, but whatever. You were, a guard shoved me out. I got bullied. Yes, all your florns. How dare you. A guard attacked me. How am I alive? Did the mission just reset? Right. I can see that I've got three sassan signals. So this is going to make things a heck of a lot easier. I completely forgot I bought chocolate covered raisins. And I have chocolate covered raisins. And I'm sorry, I had. No more arguing. Your bill has come to you. They just pushed me out, I guess. No, the banker sent us to play. Make an exception for her own mind. Momentarily. Not good enough. Right. Oh, am I allowed to be detected at this stage? Do not be detected while escorting the senator. So I'm not escorting just yet. I know I said that wrong, so I repeated it. It seemed like I said on purpose, but the truth is I didn't. I like how the senator couldn't, like, perfectly see through it. By the way, sorry, I just know it's a mean tag in the reply. Under your schedule is Cephala Fogo. Is that correct? Have I spelled it wrong? I probably spelled it wrong then. This is what you guys need to tell me what to do. Because I don't know what the heck I'm doing. Friends these days. Unfortunately, I am not one of them. Cephala Fogo. Cephala Fogo. He fights the guards and gives away money. Where have you been all my life? We better get out of here. Cephala, please. So, honey, someone on Twitter made a VTuber food tier list and they put you in impressive. Oh yeah, they like my fringe tipped. You're going to have to protect me though. Hold on, I'm taking a sipping to Nicola. Did you guys get up and start to leave? I'm so sorry. I don't know what's going on with my tum tum. I'm having to take more painkillers, but I'm having them with food, so it's not going to hurt me. I promise it's not going to hurt. Not long. Cephala Fogo, honestly. I mean, I take a little nibble out. Oh, burp warning. I burp a lot when I eat. So, please brace yourself. If you're not... Not that you're not into burping, but I understand that some people have been raised that burping is very rude, but I... Oh, I liked her scream. Okay, if you look away, your assassin recruits will despawn faster. And then they'll start reloading quicker. Did you see the art of food? Art. I've been locked out of my Twitter. I keep getting locked out of it to the point where it's inaccessible, and it keeps telling me to do these like, stupid capture thing. And it keeps saying um... No? Well, I did not see them at all. Um... So, it says like, verification complete, you're human. And then it says, error submitting. I can't do anything. I don't know what I want to do. Um... So, I've been locked out of my alt one. I've not had a chance to check out my current one. That is the music so loud in my ears. Sorry, I need to turn my headset down. I'm gonna have to get this stage. There we go. They're gang violence and I'm right now. Barpeous, more wind. Um, am I allowed to confess I've already recorded it? I sat in my recording booth for 15 minutes. I had one bottle of water and one can of cola, and I felt ill after recording it. But, I already recorded it. I'm so sorry. If it's not your thing. But, it's the truth. I already recorded it. I thought it was funny. But, I don't really have manners. I was raised in a barium. I've just gone... Oh, management unlocked my alternative twitter. Okay, I'll go. I'll look after stream. And then I'll see what I've missed because I think it's very possible I've missed a lot of fanarts or clips. Someone clipped me. Plain Assassin's Creed. Someone clipped me when me and the horse were beating up the captain. I was like giggling my little bottle off at the cliff. It was so good. I'm gonna tweet it out because like it was just so funny. I really appreciate anyone that clips me because clipping takes so much time. How long will the audio be? I think it's roughly 15 minutes after editing because I'm doing a lot of what I call live ASMR where I don't edit out all my mistakes and stuff. I know this sounds a bit funny saying it like that. But... But... Sorry. What was the name? I'm sorry. My brain's too small to think and talk and play at the same time. Oh, yeah. Live ASMR. I've really been enjoying doing it. Instead of the super hyper edited approach if I make a bump then I just lower the volume so it's still acceptable for ASMR at one point my cat came in my recording booth and I was like, do you want to do ASMR with me? And my baby boy was like so I'm just like gonna leave it in because it's just so precious and I really like it. I've really enjoyed doing live ASMR instead of like try hard even more. I've done like scripted ones as well where I'm rambling out my butt like so much. If it's not scripted my rambling ASMR is ridiculous. Like it's not even ASMR honestly. It's just me goofing off talking about whatever I like. Um, whoa, whoa, whoa. I've accidentally hired this group when I'm... How is the senator under attack? I don't even know how he's under attack. There's no one that patrols that way. As long as I don't get discovered I could be here. What happened? We're addicted to the yapping. Where can I hear the ASMR? It'll just be on YouTube. I do need to edit it. I've got a few things first before I start doing my 1000 subscriber thank you ASMRs. Like I've got a few collabs that I need to focus on first. Like I really, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why did all of that... Did I not perish you guys? Can you look at those guards maybe? Okay, there we go. They're gonna fight each other. Wait, what? Yeah, so this is true. Taser ASMR unlocked by she- What? Is she doing ASMR right now? But yeah, my rambling ASMR always end up, like non-script always end up in a massive ramble. That's not even ASMR. There's so many things in it because at one point during one of them I was like, do you want to listen to how much ASMR tools are on the floor right now? And like I kick my feet around the mic and stuff so you can hear it. It's just a scene. Am I silly Billy, honey? Wait, whatever. 100% We get Taser in the actual Taser. She's trying to make an ASMR game. What did you want again? Like I did an ear cleaning thing. Like an ear cleaning role-play. And like the first sentence I said was like, oh, the STD clinic's down to the left, mate. I was like, oh, you're here for your ear cleaning. I'm gonna start cleaning your ears. Like I'm just... I don't know why, I'm just like having such a good time. She said drunk ASMR. Oh, she's drinking, I hope she's careful. Okay, I'm gonna eat my egg and meat because I don't like when eggs are out of the fridge. I don't want to get sick. So, eggy and meat stick. Oh, she's steaming. Oh, is she steaming? Oh my god, did you hear the egg just bite me back? It's just full of the money. I can do that one easy. Easy. But I can 100% this one. I just bugged it. Bugged it. It's so good. It's so easy to make as well. It's literally boiled egg. I look forward to this drunk ASMR. Shibi's doing it right now. YouTube moderators, you have permission to link. Please consider supporting Shibi Cottonbomb. She's doing live drunk ASMR. Shibi, how's it going? We're trying to finish Christina's frickin' story line. There we go. Bancum on the way home. I'm a bit worried. I don't have a napkin again and I've just touched egg. I'll just wipe it on my hoodie. Sorry, I'm gross but it's true. Look at Emmy's alt. Bancum. Can I see it? Can I see it? See it? I think I'm following it on the memes. Where is it? Is it hidden? And you can't see it unless you search up for it? Where the heck are you? Oh, there it is. I got it. What did she post? Oh, her tummy hurt. Is that what you mean? Do you have a favorite streamer snack? No. Let's eat anything. Oh, why did I feel like I've heard it before, Strony? I'm Strony Cuddles now and I'd like to remain Strony Cuddles. Thank you very much. Underneath the tummy hurt message. Me when I can't kiss you 600 times a day. The retweet or her tweet? Tight. You up and whispering in your ear that if you can make it to 30 seconds without I'll reward you. As fast as you can. I'm watching you struggle not to. But in the end, you'll still fail. Please give me a kiss with what? Oh, I never read the full thing. I just read that her tummy hurt. Oh, my God. Emmy. That's outrageous. That's so good. Emmy. That's funny as in. You'll never guess what. H.E. Girlfriend in my DMs. I was right. There's my clubs happening by hook or by crook. I'm so bad with Twitter. I'm supposed to tweet like when I'm going live and stuff. But I just can't even ball it. I just can't even ball it with Twitter. It's for looking at pictures and then doing your thing and then going off again, you know what I'm saying? I only got to the tummy part. No, I didn't read ahead. I just saw that she had a sore tum tum. Maybe like, all the girls run their own social media. I told them do what you want. Because like, I'm so bad. I know you're supposed to tweet like oh, I'm going live. I'm doing this in an hour. And I'm like, I feel like those who want to be here already know the drill. But I do get that reminders are helpful. And say I'm going to use it for like, oh, my YouTube video for 1000 subscribers is here. Take thing. I don't miss the strong 10. That's so good. Self gatekeeping. Are we going to react to the Xbox showcase stuff? What's my stream on Sunday? I don't know. I can't, I think my stream on Sunday is the sweets. Hmm. Johnny is cute. Cute. You're cute. Reflink cute. Okay. I shouldn't munch too much, but I'm so hungry. Okay. Born sweet. Okay. Hmm. I kind of plan to do like one endurance game stream a week. So next week is Skyrim for endurance. Then we have Elden Ring for two weeks in a row after that. So I'm playing the DLC with you guys first. And then I'm playing multiplayer with sin sister. Um. And we also have shot callers and heart rate winners and all that jazz. Um. Thankfully sin sister is an endurance streamer. So like if you ever get annoyed like, uh I hate it like when streamers like don't finish a game. I don't like it either. Which is why I would love to get endurance streamers for Borderlands 2. I would love to do a VTuber playthrough like you know the VTubers. The problem is if people aren't endurance streamers that's like so long. Whereas if you can find endurance it takes maybe three streams max. If you want to just blast through the campaign maybe even two honestly. Uh-huh. Bye. What? I'm sucking my fingers. I don't know why my tongue's coming out. Oh it thinks my fingers are my tongue. Uh-huh. That's so cool. I love this. I don't know if I've ever been Borderlands 2 is like a hoot in a hole or it's like a fun game honestly. Oh maybe I should look at Marshmallow while I do this. Yes I will look at Marshmallow. That's so silly. Oh my goodness. I have a hundred more questions than I did yesterday. Oops. Any chance there will be a full body pillow for sale in the future? Yes! Uh-huh market are like absolutely amazing to work with or like whenever a girl has a birthday please tell us and we're happy to do like a new thing for you. Um so the more support like they get on UwU market right now the more favour we have to like produce something new. So for the girls' birthdays I would love to do um at least booba mouth mouth mat and also possibly their mascots in a plushie. I don't know if the designs for the mascots might be a bit advanced um or they would come out quite expensive that's the only um issue. Hi! Good to hear you. Yeah it's good to be heard isn't it? Um 100% open to any merch. We are going to establish ourselves first and then I'm going to reach out to a very unique merch and dice line because I have no idea how to bridge a connection between that for sure. You know you can only do but ask. If you do not ask you do not receive so I will ask I will see if it's possible. If it's not possible then we tried. Um would it be um I'm not going to let you know what those type of mousepad designs would be for the others. I know what mine is my big badonkadonk. I take a bite of my muffin and mmm I'm just, hi strongy I really like the Assassin's Creed streams. I wanted to give you uh feedback that I've tipped in the stream elements page around five times now between the two streams but it never came up! Oh no! Wait wait wait wait why would it not come up? Why would you get filtered? I don't I don't It was broken before it's fixed now but why would it not show up? I have bejinga narrow tiny spiny and bejinga again for today. It broke yesterday please tell me if your money didn't go through or did go through. The paper was broken because you guys gave us so much money you broke the cricket paper but it's unbroken that's what's fun. It is a legal requirement of all reeflings to love strongy stuff. I also was thinking I need to find an artist to do this one that's good with all body types I would love for our six month anniversary to have a mouse pad of all of us together like one of those big flat mouse pads I would adore to have us all together. I absolutely adore it but I would need to get a really good artist for that I would not want to waste money dicking around with an artist I would want an artist to smoke it I would adore it Since there's a notification discord server would it be possible for you to upload the unarchived stuff to the discord like a thread unarchived stuff? Do you mean like karaoke stream or the ASMR stream that went kapoot? I think because we shouldn't really host it because I got taken off so I don't want to be the ones responsible does that make sense? Like archive annons shout out to archive annons for saving everyone's butts For me I am open to suggestion if you don't like the suggestion please you're more than welcome to give me your opinion again on Marshmallow but archive annons if they broke don't fix it they've been doing fantastic they've been catching what's been put out there and hmm hmm Are alternative streams going to be free to access? Yes I do not personally believe in paying more than like 10 us dollars to like fully support your oshi and get everything that they put out there and the girls have shown an interest in playing alternative games and doing some other stuff but I would not like them to charge for it I'm going to say to them like let's not charge but obviously I will never hold you back from giving any tips to the girls you can always tip as a thank you to content that you enjoy but that's with me like someone said hmm do I plan on raising the prices of what's been established no I don't I think I think 10 us dollars per month for all the content that the girls put out is fair and I think it's good value for money and I think it also shows that like the end goal isn't great and again like 820 split comes into it type thing and it goes up in their favour next year type stuff if they want to hang about like I think if it's more than 10 us dollars you're not taking the piss but I very much push for value for money and I hope I know region doesn't always change the price of membership regionally which is obviously a big thing that's hard to overcome because we don't set the price but if the website doesn't do an alternative payment style then you're getting shafted in other countries there is a streamer that talked about selling games and it was like oh Brazil because they lowered the price in Brazil like it was fine and all that jazz I'm sorry I'm rambling I'm not making any sense um by the way cuddles I sometimes make a lot of clips as you probably remember from back then are you goober? we may be goober I'm happy for you to use my clips with whatever you want whenever but I would prepare to keep the clips of you as gay cats as possible and I only share those with the reeflings really and I post a group clips of the other girls I'm happy for the clips of the other girls in the group clap to be used to monetize the shoot oh that's so nice of you whatever you want not like it really matters what my opinion is yes it does you mean you goober and I would like to keep comfy streams as long as possible while you go naturally and share well I've got good news for you the nature of my content gate creeps me automatically do you want to hear why a little reefling my goal of a ASMR video every time I get like 1000 subscribers the reason why that naturally gate keeps me is because someone will come into the live stream after consuming that content and they'll go when ASMR, when ASMR stream and then when they see me rambling my head off about a 14 year old game having the time of my life they're gonna get bored aren't they they're only here for ASMR 5 head I'm playing chess and for D already I already did it myself they're weak they can't handle the scrawny they want the they want the stealthy ASMR whisper in ear they can't handle the rambling they can't handle the accent they cannot handle the errrr so by default I naturally gate keep myself you're welcome love you reeflings, always had you in mind Only the strongest roofling can survive on this level. First time doing this, listen to your audio through- oh wait I don't think I can read this one out loud. It's a video link! Oh am I watching that after this game? Hey I did a Scottish game show. Show them the name of places in Scotland and ask how to pronounce it. That's such a good segment, love that idea. I'm stealing it now, my idea now. They tune into a stream expecting like a soft whisper with an accent. I just sound like a bagpipe. I can't handle the Scottish ramble. Also check to see if you're still subscribed to the other girls, some have been called. Oh I saw that I was like really YouTube you're calling us after like literally a 12 hour stream. Go and calm down. It really should start to calm down now that we're streaming. There is no way you're telling me like it's gonna keep continuing because this is getting outrageous now. Like I'm not laughing, no one's hee-hawing. Strony it's not fair, you give the burp-huffer so much good stuff but what about the burp-huffer? Oh stop it! Is it terrible I have a Donothon reward where I took out my boot? There's a really funny ASMR outtake and I laugh and then it comes out more with my laugh okay? So I'm thinking about you, don't mean I'm necessarily- and I swear if anyone starts complaining like oh my god it's literally just a 10 second audio clip of me laughing and releasing air. Like do you think I don't have a digestive tract? Do you think that I'm- oh I'm such a gamer girl. Ehehehe. No I'm Scottish for one. I take big Steven jobbies, no such thing as an idol meeting and my piss is neon. Alright let's- no let's get it right, let's get it right, right off the bat I'm no having none of this. Eww you? No. I'm Strony, I'm Scottish and I was raised in a barn when they manners. If a little 10 second audio clip of me laughing while I tout filters you, my guy. Enjoy the oo-woo because that's what you're looking for, no me. You're not looking for me. And that's okay, if you're not looking for me I've got 3.3, I've got 5 adorable doors waiting on you alright. Hi. Ahem. Mmmmm. Sup. Oh I'm gonna choke. Sup lass, I feel they need to say something after that Brotherhood part 1 stream. What are you talking about? Why? You don't think you could be considered- or oh she why? Because there are creators out there who are more experienced, who you think are better so clearly would prepare them? Have you not followed- have we not followed and supported you for a while heck? I've been listening, laughing, relaxing, sagging and straight, jorkin' his pentus. For many a time now. Why do you think that is? Could it mean we adored this silly Scottish gremlin who's not afraid to be herself and treat her with love and respect? No lass, kick that impostor's syndrome to the curb, we love you. Oh you're her or she, case closed, doofus, oh thank you Evelyn, I love you Evelyn, oh. Is that a bag of chips? No, it's a bowl, like the pea snacks are really hard, I can like dink them on the bowls without them cracking. Crack. Oh there was a marshmallow you wanted to talk about on the other stream but I forgot. Oh my god right, hopefully I don't forget this time. There's a really brave wreathling who messaged me, well he's not a wreathling but he's asked for help's wreathlings okay. I'm gonna paraphrase it because I can't quite remember exactly what it said okay but basically this person is struggling to brush their teeth and I think it would be very nice if we brush our teeth together after stream, like when stream's ending we'll brush our teeth together. I know that sounds silly however it takes 21 days to form a habit and I think it would be nice wreathlings if we could encourage and help people that might struggle with that. So if you would like to brush your teeth with me at the end of stream I will give a roughly 30 minute warning so you don't have any sugary drinks or any food before because that's bad for your enamel to brush and I think it can be a really nice thing wreathlings can do for someone. Even if together we help one person hopefully if we consistently do it for 21 days we have helped that person who was very brave by the way that was a very brave message to come out with. I won't say too much about it but you know you were very straight forward and said that you don't you know consider yourself a wreathling and that's okay and you know we can't promise that we can help everyone but we would love to maybe show you a way that we can do something nice together and it's a lot easier when you do something together with someone. So yes thank you for being very brave and reaching out I would like to brush my teeth with you when I end stream I don't know if you're out there or not but we can definitely do that together yes I see no problem yes unfortunately I don't have the consistent time where we can not brush your teeth it would just have to be roughly 30 minutes before my stream ends sorry I'm pushing in my chair you're pushing my chair. Hi strongy congrats on debut I was wondering um nope you're done any games coming out that you're excited for multiplayer the binding of Isaac apparently someone went data mining and saw that there was a new repentance after plus or something so there might be patches to current items which would be very interesting forming new habits with my oh she sounds like a tuition name honestly join oral improvement she's getting closer to I am the urge to crack a british joke oh my teeth are mangled honestly my teeth are mangled I'm like they're healthy but they're just all squint and it's like I like the look of oh my god there's apparently a pandemic happening in America with veneers veneers are like these fake things you put on top of your teeth that are shaved down and it makes them look perfect but I feel like teeth have personality like I like my wee squinty-winty teeth um I just I've never seen myself any other way so it's me oh yeah I do understand for people that do need braces like there's probably something else going on but I like I was obsessed and I never got braces um and yeah I just have naturally squint teeth like they didn't come out perfect and that's fine that's just how it is um mommy I really need a hug debut has made me really emotional oh a little reflame trust me I know this isn't about me but I'm talking to you now you should be so proud of what you've accomplished I am the girls have done fantastic and I'm having a good time with my weathlands you and the girls but I feel much more lonely than I did before oh watching everyone interact with each other the girls respond into mario's ma rose and such I don't even know why I suppose I'm just envious of the attention that everyone's getting I feel so out of place I'm so sad I haven't even been able to listen to your audios to sleep I'm sorry for being selfish I feel selfish at all are you are you maybe one of the lurkers that are shy to say anything or have I managed to successfully accidentally dodge all your messages and stream and I would be a bit upset too if you were talking away and I accidentally never read out any of your messages so I do apologize if that happens and well I'm sorry real little reflame I never want to make you feel lonely if you are a lurker and you're a bit scared to talk that's okay whatever your comfort level is you're allowed to be that you can always say you can always be at arm's length or you can always be attached up my head you can sit on my head if you like and and it's okay but just I don't know hopefully it doesn't make you feel lonely like we vibe and I get to show you my childhood game you guys get to show me you get to suggest to me your childhood game I want to something strong yeah lurkers are beloved yes I understand for lurkers sometimes it can be a bit nerve racking as well to like be perceived with my eyeballs and like I I read out what you see and stuff but um literally uh if you would like evidence from my autistic diagnosis please refer to my first stream which was 12 hours long and the only reason I went off instead of 14 hours of full gameplay is because of bod okay I'm usually playing something and lurking yeah like it's perfectly okay to lurk and just do your thing not wrong with lurking absolutely not um don't be shy reflame strongy isn't always reading my comments but yeah it's um a guberrino so I do apologize I've ever made you feel left out um and hopefully it doesn't happen in the future I can only apologize uh sometimes hi strongy want you to know what I think it's very cute when you narrowed out about sassus gree brother it well I'm getting rolled in the dlcs clearly I'm not built for the dlc I have a little sip of cola a fizzy juice I lurk when I'm at work mm yeah a lot of people like lurking and listening to strongy podcast wait if you don't see the screen when I'm streaming and like I'm beating up bad guys and oh you hear us huh oh take this oh like are you like oh what's going on or can you use context clues I like to have the stream one in the background but I do like to interact I'm like yeah don't feel don't ever feel forced to interact I know some people shy like that hi goddess just wondering if you could forward something to management I know viola or not on holodex but you can still view the stream of the URL but I think the girls have something set that prevents their streams from being viewed through third-party sites well mine is fame I can't be right it's true screen off pretend and strongy physically throwing the refill and then around for sport to be honest you talk enough that there isn't dead air so I don't have to wonder about what's going on yeah I can't believe it wait was there really no dead air in the last stream I must have been quiet at some sections there's no way I had the video playing I just can't fully watch the whole stream yes the streams are a bit too long for the average adult uh okay management's gonna look into holodex I think that puts all their streams together we were thinking about hosting a website that showed all our stream schedules but it cost like more money and it was just kind of one of those things where look holodex does it for free we're just gonna let holodex take over who goes there I died for yourself there is almost no dead air outside of breaks I may wonder my throat is sore honestly after uh after I've been done with you I've watched for about five hours and wasn't any dead air you talked the entire time I do I'm very passionate about this game very very passionate uh sorry if I missed it but what are we yes your reeflings I was very dumb and never showed you what you look like that's you I've lost some gnar twerk of nature of us together and what's the old twitter check out who I follow on stronycuddles on twitter I don't use twitter much you're much better given a like and a subscribe to this youtube channel I am not much of a twitter person okay in a gush I use twitter now pretty much to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey want to make a samar hey sweetcakes want to make a samar basically that's what I do I think your longest dead air was the sprint section where you were against the clock and you're still monologued more like monomogged because I'm just that good at being a yap or ooo hey strony loving the assassin's greed I was wondering if you have ever seen or played lost planet one or two I haven't there are fun games that I think you may like even if you don't play them I still appreciate you for beating this message I have not I've never heard of them or I can't remember them being on the cover of an xbox 360 so probably not have I ever played dragon age I played the demo of dragon age one I think uh where it's like brother and sister at the star and then one of them perishes if I remember correctly yeah that's how much dragon age I've done I don't know what it's like um but yeah yes one take flamboyant cuttlefishes are highly poisonous okay well I'm a flamboyant because I'm a watermelon candy here someone described as watermelon candy and I'm like honestly true true uh will there be streams on other platforms okay congratulations on your debut I'm looking forward to supporting all the talents I must apologize I said that's so wrong I must apologize but I find myself confused what you meant by vealers collab restrictions and I'm looking forward to clarification you describe the collab restrictions as the unwritten rule through other information do you mean for me my collab restrictions are um I'm like if I don't know that someone is like me mentally then I can't stream with them because I'm dumb I can stream with the girls though that's fine and the girls can stream with whoever they like other than males they're not allowed to stream with males or interact with males or follow males literally that's the only rule and so far so good literally none of the girls have broken that rule strongy slaps of each of us behind I can make you a star yeah um it seems odd for me for them to be rules I've never heard of any other agency that has an outright rule against them against who sorry I'm not read this properly uh especially value in freedom doesn't that apologize if it comes off with really critical however I think clarification word on the issue oh and they can freaking go wherever they want oh this is asking about male collabs the person has said wrestle tube collabs were like mixed would the girls be able to do that I mean I would never stop them from an opportunity like would they be on the same team as a guy like I don't think I don't think that's like advised if it was like that like I wouldn't advise it however none of the girls have given me an indication to ever even do that like I think we would be like sorry but uh we can't uh we are following Japanese idol culture and uh no male sorry sorry we sexist out here which is terrible don't say that I learned don't say that part I learned keep burping don't apologize hello again friend of a friend I knew you well no true it's just a rule that you can bet sitting my love on I don't remember the words pick it up every time hi strongy I think you've been one guy what does that mean saying names is okay as long as it's not too much oh no so the way I I've been taught V tripper culture I'm so sorry but I've been taught by the majority V tripper culture I'm not allowed to say your name unless you don't know or membership however because and the reason why I can't do it when it's like just saying hi section or in general is because like people think favoritism is forming or jealousy and I really don't want anyone feeling put out um wait that's exactly what you've just said to me we have just agreed okay we've just agreed yes we have agreed um at the start of the ASMR stream I am going to try and say people's names just as a special thank you for showing up how do you feel that you're no longer a v-tweeter well hopefully my first stream length really showed how much I enjoy v-jobbing sup cuddles was thinking of a tag uh I've missed the tags I kind of finished them oopsie uh please do give us a guide for those script writing yes um I'm currently getting a new manager on board that deals with all the scripts and thank god he is a male because he can actually write scripts that guys want to hear because I can only guess what you want to hear and so much. So like roughly the first three months of scripts are me, and then it goes to other script writers, and then it goes to the script manager, but we're a testing script manager. But if all goes well, my responsibility is less than so much, and I can stream so much more! Well at the start of the stream you were at 3.5k, now you're at 3.3. Heck yeah, that means I don't have to edit the 4k thousand any time soon. That's fine. Hey, I have to say that I think you are amazing. I don't get to interact with many Scottish people online. That's because a lot of things had to go wrong in my Scottish life to become a VTuber. That's why there's no Scottish VTubers. Do you know how? Oh no, I've hurt myself. My finger is bleeding. Why? What did I cut myself on? I've not touched anything sharp. Is there anything sharp in this room? Ouch. It stings. Hopefully I can still keep gaming. Scotland only has one computer. No like genuinely, there's a reason why there's not a lot of Scottish VTubers. If you genuinely like grew up around, well like grew up around like normal friends, you would genuinely be like bullied so hard. Like bully culture like in America and Australia and the UK is so prevalent. Like if you show any enjoyment or being slightly different from the status quo, you get sicked on like a hound like sickum. It was crazy. Pour some Azura milk on it honestly. I don't know, I can't remember how I cut myself. My finger. I'm okay though. Someone says, hi Strony, I missed all of your livestreams, rip. But I do have a few questions. What happens if one of the girls wants to leave? They leave? Question mark? They get to go? We don't have a non-compete. I don't believe in them. I don't think they're nice. They are not kind. If you no longer work for the Vealer agency, why do you prevent you from making money elsewhere? That is called being messed up. Will you retire the character? Yeah. Also if you can, what are the plans for Gen 2? Will you bring in 6 new girls and retire the other? If Gen 2 is the thing, there will be 6 new girls on board. When Vealer agencies come out with Generations, everyone can be active at the same time. It's not a problem. So Generation 1, all 6 active. Generation 2, all 6 active. So that would be 12 total. Then if Generation 3 and everyone's happy with their cuts and things are all nice and swimmingly, then Generation 3 and there will be a total of 18 Succubi and V Succubi. Wow. That's very daunting to think of but thank God I'm not the script master anymore because if I was the script master, I could not stream. I genuinely could not stream. There are absolutely no interest for any Generations after 3. No spin-off Generations. No secret plans. No save for work Generations. None of that. I am exhausted. I took insane amounts of HP damage getting Gen 1 out. I am ill. I want to get myself better and I'm going to stream and I'm going to enjoy every second of it. But yeah, we are not having to retire Gen 1 to get Gen 2 out. No. Sorry. Lastly, and this may be Taboo to ask. I'll read it in my head. That is controversial. It's not controversial. What's an item you would copy and steal from the other girls? Succubi's not. I will be taking no further questions. Why is everything in Japanese? Are you weeb? Nothing's in Japanese. Actually this is a fully English stream. There's nothing in Japanese at all here. What's going on? How am I supposed to support the girls when you keep pulling me in? I'm pulling you into my gravitational pull. Can't escape this gravitational pull. The website? Oh why Marshmallows You'll never guess what country Marshmallow was made in. It was made in Japan. It's all Japanese so Google. I use Firefox which does have a translator thing. Someone says please William Wallis all over me. Oh yeah you like that. I don't know if this made it through into twice. It's a PNG. Do we open it? Are we going to open it live on stream? Oh it's me with my autism hair. I thought it was going to be something else. I had my autism hair. I thought it was going to be something else. But I saw it was a PNG and I was like I'll go for it. Okay I just quickly refreshed. We've got a few more and then we'll jump back into their pay. Someone says check Smuttlefish hashtag. Hashtag is on safe mode. Show me the goods. Smuttle did I spell it right? It's been hating? It's hidden for me? Check your search. Hate sensitive media. Absolutely not. Show me the goods. There's two goods inside. Oh my god I have faith. And my hair is so big and I'm sitting in a clam. And there's a second one. Oh my god there's two. In the second one I say come closer to me. Have I got hypno eyes? Oh I've got hypno eyes in the second one. Oh that's so good. They're so good. I love it. Thank you. I cannot react to it because I'm on my minicum. But they're so good. There's three R's. I can't see the third one. I only see two. Some accounts seem to be muted for me for some reason. I can't see the third one. Only see two. I don't see it. It's not displaying. I don't know what's up with Twitter. It's like really having a hard time. I see it. I have a tail. It looks like three. Girls and viewers have a tail. No I have a tail. I have a leash. I have a leash. Oh my god. Oh my god. Thank you. I love it. I have a leash. Oh it's so good. And the tail goes green at the tip as well. Just like my horror. I'm going to stare at it for a very suspiciously small amount of time later today. That's terrible. What are you doing to me? I should be the one saying this to you. I accidentally... Thank you very much for that fanart. I like all fanart actually. I need to put it in my folder. I have a folder of all the fanarts in so far. Someone says, I loved your audios in the part where you talked about... Yeah you let me talk about her baguette and go squishy with it. It's the nicotine patch under the bangs for real. I don't actually have it. However I quite like the idea that we both have the nicotine patch because we're both addicted to each other as we are each other. Yes, yes, yes. It doesn't show up on my... Yeah it never showed up on my face. Hi strongy. I just want to say that's really great how much you care about the progression of the other girls and your inspirational speech in your first AC Brotherhood. You're a really cute person. I hope you have all great and long careers. Also now I have a thing for the Scottish accent. Oh I do you like this big man? Oh I am pure coming over to you like a satyabas coming to your house. You'll be sleeping in your bed and then you'll feel my hundle over you. That's right and before you know it you've popped abowny and it's all that funny. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? Because you got it with me baby. Is Daystream another endurance stream? I have no idea. I'm a bit nervous. I don't know if we can do 100% Assassin's Creed so we're just having fun. Strongy is just an industry plant from the Scottish tourism board. Don't fall for it. Don't fall for my tricks. You shouldn't come to Glasgow and spend all your hard earned money. There's totally no amazing lovely tourist cafes in Glasgow. Watching Austin Powers is going to hit different. I've never seen it. I'm so excited to watch Austin Powers you guys. I think that's all the lovely Maru's I have. I is 411 Maru's. Okay who's ready to replay this memory? Weirdly I haven't had an urge to visit Glasgow. Scotland has turned to hypnotism. Wait did we not finish that memory? Oh we didn't. I thought we did. I went away and got food. Nori nori. Okay are you trying to get achievements? I'm going to see where it takes us. I don't know if I can do 100%. My confidence as we played some of the DLCs has gone down significantly because I don't know what the solution is to a few hundred percent. So if this game tells me I have a new outfit unlocked one more time I'm going to cry. It's done it so much. How does my browser all come to die directly to stories? Oh that's terrible. I need to start retweeting stuff. Like I want to rule play with the R. I'm sorry I said it I don't care. People find it cringe. Yeah you know what's cringe? Your VTuber never had any good time with you. That's cringe. That's different. Hypnotic Scottish assessment. Forbacione is such a specific word. Oh we are like that. So we don't actually want to kill this archer because if we do his body is going to drop down. See how it only got out. I'm going to pray the body doesn't fall right in front of me. Don't do it ragdoll physics. I'm going to be mad. I might actually have to try hard during this segment. I'm not to touch the ground and I'm not to get detected. I do have issues. Are you trying to give me a heart attack because it's actually working me. You're getting me concerned. I'm getting a bit concerned about how much you're launching. You're launching yourself. He's at a rooftop. I have no idea if you guys can understand me when I start doing that on purpose. Like being super scots on purpose. Or does it just sound like it's just kind of like pleasant noises for you. I think we're just going to do that. Yeah As long as his body doesn't go sliding down off I'm fine with everything that goes on. I understand it. No it's pleasant. Oh my god you guys are so scots. If you can you're actually getting pretty scots. Is it? Wait is that your literal translation of scots there? Stop. What does that say? I'm like trying to reach out and play the game at the same time. I'm actually such a skilled streamer. Sorry I played this game so much I couldn't do it. There are some bits and pieces here and there but it's mostly understandable. Ah, tu comprendes? Fuck it let's just go French. I'm surprisingly soothing. I'm definitely going to do a hard Scottish accent ASMR. I don't know what I should do with it like tingle wise. Or maybe it should just be like go to sleep mate. I'll get these. These are really coolant on your face and they go bloop bloop bloop bloop. And it'll be really nice. It'll put you to sleep real quick. Oh you still don't want to sleep right? Let me get the ear cleaner and snake. I think you call it a Q-tip but it's actually called ear cleaner. That's the kind of ASMR I want to do. Yes please. I'll just call it super scots ASMR and then people are like don't be silly. There's no such thing as super scots ASMR and then they click the listen and they're like they click to listen and they're like I understand now. I get it. Oh please don't ragdoll physics. Do no drop. They cannot get past those cortisans huh? I feel like there's definitely more on the map. I think that person yesterday was actually correct and said the more favour you gain with the factions the more they appear on the map because all of a sudden I'm seeing zans everywhere. His body is tempted to fold over. Literally it's like giving me a mini heart attack. Can I aim on you? Aim, aim, aim. No aim bot, aim bot, aim bot. Just don't want to do it for me. It's really annoying when it does that. That's not good. I really do not want that guy to be able to see me. Oh no, no, no, don't, don't, don't. Yeah, didn't think so mate. Right, he's just discovered that body. Do I desync because he sees the body or am I? I actually think I'm safe. You know that? I think I've done it. Even though he sees the dead bodies of I, that's fine. Okay, we did it. We just have to hang out on this little edge. Oh no we don't because there's freaking guards right there which I don't like. Hopefully we don't have a problem. Scotch, want me to speak calmly while you enjoy a heart meal? Is it weird being the Scottish accent? No, it's not weird at all. It sounds like home. A body? Just another day in the room. Honestly, if you've totaled how many SEOs joined, I feel like it's a really considerable number. Wait, can I move on this? Do not be detected and do not touch the ground while tail in the centre. I can touch the ground now, right? That's definitely not, I'm not. I swear if this is like we're broken it. Yeah, okay, I was gonna say I was like that's the silliest thing I've ever heard if it's like you're not allowed to do it. Celtic language is just assistant to me. Oh, there's Scotch, there's Scotch. Can you get up please? It's not mysterious. Video embedding issues should now be fixed for all channels. We're not on Holodex, are we? Did you guys already get us on Holodex? There's no way. Or are we? I thought it was like a view thing like you needed a certain amount of views ourselves or something. Thanks, we suck. There's an endy say. Ah, I confirm. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Hopefully everyone's viewable and you can see what's up. Shibi's still alive, I believe, and we don't have a zero today. I think it's a rest day for a zero if I'm not mistaken. Okay, we're done. We did it, 100%. You're not, but you can still use the zero to create your own. Not views, so I've got a 20 key average on channel, yeah. It means about to go live, heck yeah. What's it mean to do in the day? I would highly recommend in and out. Yeah, the court is blocked us from being able to do the bench thing. I know how to do the bench thing, it's not a problem. Oh, she's meme reviewing. Come on, come on, come on. Scots East, more strongly misunderstanding the listener's lack of accent. We can't go in. Fitty land, boy. Fitty land? Fitty land? Fitty land? Well, you've succeeded in confusing me. I'm back. Take a break to listen to music. Hell, Claudia, the banker is here. Oh, I have so much money to hire these lovely ladies. I'm too good, literally. Okay, Emmy live in... when? Soon? Can't take the name of the music, so... Beautiful. Ciao bella. Che cosa. I don't want to get them on that sofa. Oh, he's staring around. No one's actually named it Luigi. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. See, that five times fast. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. But they are giggling away and won't stop losing. Right, so take them and then go back to the full stack. Because I don't want to get in any trouble. I think we just got 50% DNA, so I think we might actually have... I think we might actually have a new Pristina memory unlock. If it's 25%, then 50%, then 75% like that reason said, then should we help? I can protect you. I can protect you? Speaking of smoking, you're fortuitary friendly. You want to go for it? No, nothing for me to say. I'm trying so hard not to lose them to a guard right now. I think we're okay with the render difference. I have no idea what we're missing and not done yet. We're replaying easy missions that I failed in order to get higher DNA sequence. Pristina's story doesn't unlock until you have high synchronicity, so I'm having to go back and redo missions that are easy. And that will raise our overall percentage. And then we should be able to finish whatever happens with Pristina because it ended and it didn't make any sense at all. We're done this part, we just need to do the benchmark now. How far are you planning on taking Viola or dominating? No, not dominating. I just want the girls to achieve their dreams and achieve what they want to do. Have a good time. It's kind of like what are Viola's dreams? Viola's dreams or whatever the girls' dreams are because we want them to be happy. Interesting what about alcohol? Oh, I can't have alcohol. Have you guys drank its fine? I'm going to stop you. But yeah, alcohol and me don't go well. It speeds up my heart rate, it makes me feel uncomfortable and I get... I'm very late wait, even though I'm Scottish. I'm so freaking late wait, it's so annoying. I'm stinky, like why? So I just can't really handle it. I don't do it. Also there's been like tons of reports that come out where alcohol is really bad. But I'm not going to say no to like drunk karaoke streams or something like that. I kind of learned that... So when you feel a buzz from alcohol, you don't have to drink any further than that point to keep the buzz going. That's not how alcohol works. I only recently learned that back anyway. But I won't be shy of doing like drunk karaoke. I'll drink for the both of us honestly. There's less of you to fill alcohol with. Oh, please excuse me. I'm holding B, please excuse me. Ladies, ladies, sync with me my goodness. Work with me here. No Guinness for strong. I actually like drinking beer. It's probably the only thing I can handle at the moment. Please remember to drink water if you do drink it. Yes, I did not want any issues. What's the way to celebrate my birthday? Than to join in the brotherhood of man. Soon, we will be here once more. Celebrating a new night. And then the feasting will last for 40 days and 40 nights. Not even the girlies drink? I mean, Shibi is live right now doing drunk ASMR. I don't know, I just never... I never had like going out friends. Let go like... Like nightclub or rave or any of that. Which is where a lot of drinking culture comes into play in the UK. The aim when you go out with your friends is to get plastered. Which is just not very pleasant. Chesering full plated armour. If only we had a very strong kneecap. Sure would be a shame. Oh, I did a challenge. Right, let's do this without getting in trouble this time. You go away. Thank you very much. Right, and then you stop so I can go in this blend spot. No, you're right in front of me. This is what we didn't want last time. Half my friend group loved getting hammered and half did not. Yeah, like I didn't really experience any of that. So it just never really became a thing. And like obviously hang up. Right, I definitely can do this thing. Yeah, okay, easy peasy. 100% right there. I was the Disney driver on my 21st birthday. Oh, that's right. 21 is a drinking age in your country. Honestly, I'm going to happy here. I'm going out or getting good at it. It was going out or getting good at AC Brotherhood. Literally, I like just play video games all day. I'm sure it is fun if you're into it, but like I just have no interest. I have an interest in like doing like tipsy streams or like drunk review of movies. Okay. Not again. Did it twice. I'm sure there's a freaking hay bale down there or something. Drinking with good family friends is probably getting me. Well, you're getting hammered. Well, you were out there getting hammered. I was exio al dottori himself. Right. Wait, those missions only went up to sync to 51%. So didn't you, Christina, get unlocked at 50%? Oh. What do you mean? I've only done 50% of the game. Ah, right. Those ones are difficult, so I actually don't want to do them. What's this one? The Baron de Voix. Gatekeeper 50-50. What are you? Don't lose any health squares. Okay, this one's super easy. We can do this one. I'm literally doing it easiest to hardest. Then we'll get hard at the end. How should I beat you first try and get clues? Sorry, I need something like that because it's not very nice. Because like I completely understand that. I did it again. It makes that noise. I think that must be an audio mistake or something because... Your men can overpower the camp's patrols, correct? Yes. I was studying the hidden bleed. I was such an Assassin's Creed fanboy. I used to think it would be so cool if I got like the Assassin's Creed logo branded on my finger. I was so impressionable as a child. You're truly a man after my own heart. So impressionable. Not very smart. It's kind of character. I will get the armor. My troops will gather it from the dead. The stream tomorrow is a native streamer overload. Native streamer overload. It's actually a pretty good pill for me. Next, small fish, the AC logo in tattoo. Only refilling Assassins allowed inside. Okay, if this is just don't be... Actually, well, I am here. No, not while I'm here. We have to do it outside of the mission. No, I always go that way and it's like the longest way to find anyone. That's a good reason that young people can't get tattoos. Yes, I would like to be sitting here with like a freaking branded fingers. Probably the Sega logo on me at one point as well for... Don't get detected. For Sonic Heroes. I always loved it when it was like Sega. Did that not alert anyone? They're actually so efficient at fighting that it didn't alert anyone. What do you guys get? Okay, Assassins are pretty high level. I'm pretty sure they can handle what's going to happen. Oh, there's a patrol route. Oh, there's a big old fight going on. Okay, we're at five costumes. They're still going for it. Whoa, they're getting beaten up by the big guys. Oh, they're fighting back. They're beating them up. Four to two. Oh, she lost the health bar. Wow, I actually thought the... Oh, they're going for this. They're doing it. They're doing it. They're going for the patrolers as well. Oh, we got ten in that one. That was a really good one. What's over here? Another French battalion thing. When needy streamer overload, okay. I think that's definitely going to be a shorter stream. However, when I do have shorter streams, I'm going to be working on ASMR collabs and stuff, so there's not going to be more content coming. I'm going to cry here. Let's see. Oh, that's actually for two assassins to take on that big old group. That's quite a lot. Yeah, one of them just lost a health bar. I actually think I'm going to have to send in more assassins. Oh, they've lost two health bars. This is getting juicy. Oh, the other one's lost one as well. Oh, it's getting juicy. It's getting juicy. Oh, there's losing three. I don't want to get detected because that will ruin this little sequence, but I will call in the next card. There you go. There you go. I have no idea what's going on over there. I don't want to get detected to ruin it, but... Oh, he's on two. Okay. Help him! Freaking... Ah. Jeez. Okay, I definitely need to level up the gang because they are still not strong enough for this. Stop. Oh, my goodness. No, don't pick on a guard, please. Oh, right. Everyone despawn right this instant. My heart. Right. They'll heal up. Whenever your assassin is low, they'll heal up. I thought we lost them. Oh, my goodness. I thought we... I was like... I called in another assassin on that guy that was in particular his harasser. I was like, where are they? Where are they? Like, where are they going from? And I was like, oh, wait. I can shoot off my horse. Like, I can still attack, technically. I just need to not be discovered. That's all. I'm gonna wait to call in my assassins to do this. I really don't want to actually get caught. I'll be annoyed at myself if I do. There's another guard post all the way over here. Excuse me. Pardon me, come through. Oh, wow. Yeah. There's a big one over here. Maybe... Big like mine. Okay, let's just send in guards. Eh, guards. And like this. Fill health already. There you go. Hold on. Super simple. Super easy. Got 100%. Literally, that's all I had to do last time. I wonder if I didn't have all, I say, a... Signals? Um... Doing. Oh, no, my track is bugging out again. Please stop. What's this one? Don't take any damage. Don't lose any health squares. That one's not easy because of how many enemies can just swing at you. And that first one... I'll try it. Do I plan on unlocking all the endings on Needy Streamer? I don't know how much I'm gonna like it. I'm gonna play it for the first time. I think it's like a click game, which honestly might make it super simple. If I like it, then I'll try and get all endings if I don't like it. And then I'll probably just do a few runs and then have a short stream and then I'll work on ASMR. That sounds like a deal. Surprise me. The French puttane have us under pressure. Tell me about their general. These... Baron de Valois. Some major is just the, like, the hmm option. And over and over again. Where can I find him? To watch the bed. Wait, do I need to censor the stream? Is it safe to stream it? They seem to be getting closer. The situation is under control. Close the gates! Needy Strony overload. Oh, I should have named it that. I'm taking that. Thank you. No, you can do it. Okay. Right. Don't take any damage. I'm gonna do that. So that stops them. Okay, that's what I'm nervous about. Them doing that. And I don't have a freaking smoke bomb. I have... I don't have any more smoke bombs. Right. Oh, I think I might need to... Oh, I can call in my recruits. Oh, my God. Please don't attack me. I really don't want to lose health over this. I can't see because of the camera angle. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm going for it. I'm sending it. I'm sending it. Please don't attack me. Please don't attack me. Okay, my assassin recruits are going ham. That's what I like to see. They're stuck outside. Assassin, please. Jeez. Are you trying to make me lose? Jeez. Is there anyone else? Wait, what? On air? I've never seen this before. I guess I'll just... Wait, they keep seeing me, though. I can't... So the AI can't actually see me, but it keeps claiming it is. It's not. I think I'm just going to shoot them. I can. Oh, I can. I'm getting them. Okay, that was... Okay, we did it. We did it. We did it. It's just heavily implied. It's more of a win-win-win-nothing. Okay. He did it too well. He dumped people in us. Blame them with your ink. Maybe I should have had an ink toy, but what would have been funny is anything. Like, I'd just go... And it was all in screen. Oh, no! Didn't the developers also make another game? A whale after? Oh, I think so. Hello! Hello, everyone! How are you? Today... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... Yeah, I can't speak none of that. Okay. Okay, I think we just need to go back and forth and not get attacked by anything, which is super simple. Oops. Maybe part of a 2.0 or a new output. Why is your French so good? No, it's nothing else. Don't understand the French. No, I don't understand it. Oh, no, my eyes. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. I actually don't know any French. I literally know phrases. And I record to take the same phrases. If you would like to order a ham and cheese baguette, you say... I forgot what cheese is. A baguette. Well, that didn't... That didn't work out very well. No. Baguette. Well, it sounds good coming from a French speaker. Oh, thank you. How are you doing? How are you? Huh? Are you okay? Oh, wait, that was for a joke. What's the French password? Hmm... I don't know. I don't know. One... Two... One baguette. And one... Ramon. Who wants me to play with you? That's like, I'm literally just regurgitating. Do I have higher education? That sounds like I have higher education. That's just new. Reason of barn. Uneducated in the barn. And became a gamer. Hell yeah. Ray. I'm a bit scared of this one. Don't lose any health squares. I actually don't want to do that one because it takes too long. Right, we're at 52%. So every time I do a memory, I'm getting like up to 5%. Use assassin recruits to do your targets. Okay, we're actually factually going to upgrade our assassin recruits. Which... Sorry, I just closed this, but we actually needed to open it. If I do this, they get... Okay, we just need to send them on missions. If we get 5 assassins level 10, the assassin's recruit signal replenishes so much faster. I think it takes off like 20 seconds. Which, in the grand scheme of things, like adds up so quickly. How much money do I have on my purseings? 13k, right, I don't have enough right. We'll just go and... We'll send them on... Missions. Like the pigeons. Oh, it was like dead ahead, dead center. I remembered an Italian swear. I'll use it in a sentence. I didn't even know that. I know catso. And merda. Oh, we put 50 grand in the bank? 50 smacaroons. Right, we're going to send away our agents. Because I want some of them to level up so then we can get faster. I have no one at 10 yet. What? You guys... Oh, you're getting close. Right, I just need to send them away. Maybe do a mission that doesn't require them. And then we can get the... Upgrade. 5, 1, 2, 3, and 4. If you guys all go... I think... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Oh, I don't want to risk the room. If it fails... I'm like 99% sure they come back all perished. If it fails, which is like pretty unforgiven. Honestly, your openness and no manners is one of the reasons why I like... Oh, that's funny. Right, missions, missions, missions. Wait, they don't have... 17 minutes for that mission? Is really not. Is there not another level 5 regular contract? There's no... Oh, these are all level 5s. All four of you go together. And you're humble, little thing. Alright, as an Italian myself, I have to say here in the dub for Italian phrases another language is cringe. Oh, you don't want to hear me say Spingy, Spingy, Ayuto, Ayuto! Ayus meus, Dios me... Wait, no, that's Spanish. Right, we're going to go to a bank. Ummmmm the Bangkok, Bangkok, Bangkok, Bangkok As in Italian you tell, please say more Italian words. Ayye, Ay... Ayus, meuls! To say... I don't think I have any Italian word. I'm ready for a little nap after eating all those little snacks. I still have P-Snacks left over. I forgot to eat any of my rice. I'm gonna have to put them back in the fridge. Oh, I need to buy paintings wait the paintings question mark and go to DNA Fifty-two four seven fifty-two four seven fifty-two four seven fifty-two Four seven fifty-two Spend all my money on London, oh, excuse me you're in my way I Just need to access the bank over here. I don't mind get a little wet. Why not we That's my favorite food chatting has to be chicken It's too tasty, I don't know. I just did something. I like savory foods over sweet foods Savory is just dab on Flags feathers and chest today to flag go to the percentage because I feel like the DNA sequence doesn't is like so Rough colonel standards use that something I can't do that. Just yeah Don't be detected like I don't like the Beat Chesery to the apple of Eden. Don't hurt anyone Cuz they're all attacking you Beat Chesery to the apple Eden don't hurt anyone Mmm, I have my hand over my mouth thinking I'm oh, I don't have any smoke bombs I don't have any smoke bombs on my person so I can't get away with that fried all fried by far Yeah, for sure, would you like if you heard an Italian speak your navel image sure might not be some bad But you know the accent can pack a punch Oh So Okay, yeah, the layers of Romeo the war machine. Oh, oh Wait, do these have a percentage No, these don't have a percentage Oh Okay, this is why our thing is so low Okay, okay, we're gonna do assassin's contracts wherever the heck they are that's why the freaking percentage is so low these symbols the pigeon Like these ones is it that assassin contract, right? Okay. Okay. I Was gonna say because it's not making a lot of sense why the percentage is so low There's only a few missions that haven't done a hundred percent on I'm gonna be honest and I don't think we're gonna hundred percent it But we definitely finished the game and I'm sat aside That after like the stream, we don't need to hop back on black a on black ops on brotherhood Hey, cuz I'm satisfied with the play through Cuz yeah, I don't actually have much me okay, so I just need to kind of do all the Black markers on the map really maybe factions also half of it if I get like a hundred percent favor in the factions as well Okay, see yummy, honestly It's been very close it's it's more of a cozy day I think yesterday like I used up a lot of my energy on a rifle Just like being like gushing about this game and being like it's getting so cool Today it's like it's definitely cozy. It's definitely have a little blankie on you and make sure you're comfy I Yesterday I was screaming my head off like just loving everything and so energetic But like that get to be like that unapologetically cuz like nothing's worse than like being excited for something and then Someone's like, oh, you're being really loud and obnoxious. So just like kills like oh, this is a lot of me Like I'm having such a good time. You never met someone who's like genuinely excited for Yes faction challenges are also part of the percentage of the contract no not like contract Mission Chesery hopes that our rebels will stumble into his line of fire his expected come and wait instructions Kill the three targets in two minutes. Oh my god. These have freaking things as well Oh, okay, I'm starting to understand why our DNA think is so unbelievably low Oh, he's just that range Wait under three minutes three gunmen and under They're not that far away. Okay, I guess the assassin's contracts are super nice Because this guy's on that far away. Oh like that was like super reasonable Oh, I can't reach that Oh That quick Okay, I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'll I'll I'll meet ankles I'm out of medicine. Oh and smoke worms Oh, there's a doctor over here. That's perfect Oh What was out of medicine I've seen the thing is I don't look soldiers bodies so I don't get anything from him. He'll heal me. You should heal myself. No Do the feathers count as DNA or possibly You don't need ankle Right, so literally just do the pigeon clips and then it's going up Oh, yeah, 53 percent. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let him get up. Let him get up 53 percent. Uh, how do you go up there? That looks like a hell to me.

I'm gonna need a horse for this I said I'm gonna need to wait. I'm blind. I just passed off on the horse. Sorry mate. My apologies Uh, if it's super easy to do the assassin contracts, we'll just do them get them out of the way and then Hopefully that's like our percentage raised by like five That's pretty good Uh, actually I could also use these mercenaries Well, I can't right now Uh We're just Trying to do what we can. It's very unlikely. We're gonna 100% it, but I'm enjoying myself thoroughly Uh, I'm actually gonna go get a blanket because I'm putting my legs on the table and I'm killing circulation to my leg I'll just be a second. I don't need to mute so you can Uh, was it I Have my lovely blanket to protect my leg Because the circulation is dying because I pressed them so hard against the table They ain't sitting on my feet.

It was a smaller mission I Screen shot that That's an interesting I'm supposed to close my eyes before I leave like so the thing looks right, but I'm just gonna keep sending people to Do more um Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb. I was supposed to accept uh, assassination contract missions The ball on the Choose company kill both targets for your hidden belief. You do not have to tell me twice I'm loving these assassin missions. Are you joking me? I assume I don't have to get on a horse to reach them But we're getting pretty far Uh, I can't tell which one's closer Eh, what is this? The wheat. Oh, wow. They're like, okay, actually it's closer to a door than four. Let's do that By Austria and Switzerland just 26 right now Oh Literally the assassin missions are like so easy and like um, um, we might be like 57 Once by the time we're finished them if they make them this easy then Yeah If you die Your assassin rule before promoting them a max their cape match will be that color. I have no sense Wait that Assassin contracts are so easy. I love it here. What the heck no like don't be detected and there's 18 billion like guards looking at you Shout out to assassin contracts. Hello. I can't believe how easy these are Oh, excuse me mr. Horsey yet in Maui The 68% finish is that where we'll end on 60% I'll give the Leonardo missions ago It would be nice 100% but my goodness, I didn't know I'll see what happens by the end of this stream like I didn't I thought I was only going to do six hours today Hi, I'm sorry Bye Um What percentage are we now in like 54 55 I love it here says 55. Oh my god more contact. Please. They're so easy. Is there any more? No, but there's Templar agents Okay, we're going to do Templar agents. I'm totally not stalling on the Leonardo missions because I know they're a bit tricky Last Christina needs 75 percent. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're gonna do it. We're gonna do it I mean, honestly, it might be one of those things where I'm like We'll do what we can I actually don't know how long we're gonna Like stream today. As I said, I was only planning on doing Six hours ish, but I mean we're already getting close to that mark It's already been four hours and a half. Yeah, and I'm like I don't really feel like I'm out of stamina right now for stream so Yeah, and like especially tomorrow Depended on like how much I like the game. It might only be a tour stream which kind of is a bit meh um I believe Anything called love just listen to the rhythm of your heart Da da da da da da da da da Yeah, literally it may be one of those things where I end up actually getting so close that we do just go Oh wait, the bank. I can collect money from it Eh Oh, no, I've already collected my money. Oh, please I suppose once we buy the last, um how you call them, touristic locations, then we'll shall. I'm trying to do the faction challenges, like on the way there. Yeah, like I need to hire thieves to lure people away. You need to do it 10 times like through their quest then. I just need to find enemies Yeah, just like that We need to complete Christina literally Right, what's this? Hi. Are you okay? Oh? It's not looking good She's beating up Don't I will not touch you what happened here He owns this neighborhood that border I have given it to him He once made signs for the shops in the district But now he post lies for the border and hurt those who stand in his way. Wow Where is he? He spends his days locking his workshop, but I may know how to go them out What we're doing kill your target with the hidden blue. I love these missions. What the heck? Yesterday said eight hours on the end of being 12 it would have been 14 I Don't know maybe one day they'll fix the vod issue if the day comes where they fix that vod issue Please let me know because it is over for your sleep schedule. I'm talking we wake up We brush our teeth. We get our food and then we stream 14 hours Wait, it's the doctor what was to do? Oh, no, it's the same Interact oh We're pulling down propaganda my apologies. I Didn't know Can you at least reserve the weekends? Yeah, oh you need a break from my stamina. You're so adorable refling There's no breaks on this tree. I Was gonna say something else there We're pulling down propaganda it's useless posters Sleep is already ruined what's a lot more room I Like I'm trying to do this like obviously they did the poster grab and things When you've got no right, but I didn't realize they like we use that actually like the concept because obviously like whenever you think of the Past you're like, how did all these people like even get caught for crimes like it just seems so Oh Kill your target with them Can I rip it down or are they gonna be mad at me? Okay, that's exactly odd up smoke bombs We're just so that length Well, whoa, whoa, I wasn't even yes See that's what I get annoyed with if you don't enter combat before they whack you you can't count us And I look you can't see one boom, but yeah I might be able to get a smoke bomb off of this guy for a little which I would actually really appreciate in case Ancient room graffiti you see the walls the Pompey. We're at oh, yes. He does give me a smoke bomb. That was lucky I'll definitely try and remember to oh So when we pull this down I assume we get to meet the guy Oh, we lure him out of his workshop because we've filled all those posters down, okay We can definitely do Other fan bases be looking at we feel like a man dying of dehydration watching another man drowning That's so good. What I For goodness sake, I'll get Santa my At least he well in this house Like I do feel bad when like people have a streamer that maybe like struggles to stream And I just find they're like a really good time poke it down Is that a multiplayer character it kind of looks like it might actually be If it is then that's like another Complement to the game would be in like how they incorporated multiplayer characters into the game campaign between Drowning is standing Did you ever play the multiplayer for this game I Don't I Think I was aware of it 56% okay hold on. I'm starting to have hope I'm starting to have mild hope. I don't want to get anyone I Don't want to lead to anyone on But it might be possible it might be for the hundred percent run Because that's going up way faster now that we're just sorry I should be re-riding horse right now and Because that like literally I was so confused why like the percentage was so low okay So let's let's see what happens. Let's see. We're at 55 percent. I believe I've gone Oh, I remember this one is that stupid You go all the way around in order to oh, actually I'm gonna send off assassin recruits Need to level them up and we need money money money for tourist attractions I Know I know Knowing that a streamer you like is on most of the days I got time from yours Yeah, like I don't really get born out like I'm happy to talk about it, but like I Just don't seem to experience like so don't get me wrong. I absolutely can have days where I am Like ready to go to bed, but like I wake up on the other side of bed, and I'm like What we doing like let's go do this. Let's go do that. Um Send them off for 200 type thing But like actual burnout like I always wake up the next day like wanting to do something more Oh, there's actually a contract right here. We is that inside? Oh It's fantastic there. Hello, Madame Madonna Madonna The pigeons deliver the names of key paper agents the Jubilee has brought the hard part will be the last 5% Exchange for up solution Threats of damnation terrorized those reluctant to pay the agents collections go directly to Chaldery I will make money the least of their worries What's the hundred percent New assassin contracts a lot Say no more my lady. Say no more Okay Let me get up. Okay. We've got more assassin contract, which means the percentage will get even higher very shortly Send away my assassins to level up and Well, pardon me, excuse me come through my ladies. Would you like to distract those? More ladies would you like to come and distract some There's any guards ahead unfortunately, I'm on a horse so much faster than them And the horse is stuck on the hill. That's the only thing I don't like with a game Right, uh, there's no guard. So we're just gonna we'll be fine. It's okay Where's this guy? I'm on the wrong side. Hello. Oh, there you are Oh What are these contracts doing Just one shooter it will be easy to overtake cannot be very accurate Oh He's swinging a huge person and Kill the target using the head and bleed within 45 seconds Don't like change both try it 45 seconds run run run run run run run right he's gonna close that. Okay Okay? Okay? 45 seconds hidden bleat. 45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat. 45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat, hidden bleat, hidden bleat, I love hurting people with a hidden bleed, okay we did it. Oh. His name is Laquac. Okay, we did it. What's your take on the best AC game regarding story-wise? Exio's story-wise? Like, all of Exio? Uh, like, especially Revelations, when... Whoa, why am I under attack? What's going on? Give me a run. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where did you even come from? I didn't want to hurt anyone, though, as you're doing. I saw that, so I'm gonna grab it. I didn't even know where those guys came from. They're no stationed here, right? Oh. I'm not having a good one around. Hmm. You know if we're part of these, Exio's killing a lot of the multiplayer characters. Yes! Definitely. We'll go get this assassin contract. Well, can I just spin around the map again, like, how we did when we were renovating everything? Spin around the map. Why is he whispering in Italian to a French? I don't even know how you'd say rest in peace in French. Dormez-vous! Dormez-vous, mate. So, la-vous. C'est n'est pas la vie? No, no, it's not the life anymore. My French is awful. I get very confused with how they structure, like, words in French. It's true. It's true. Do you ever think about if Exio was really here to be an insane serial killer and probably the highest kill- Oh, yeah. Actually, who does have the highest kill count? Oh! Don't answer that, actually. Yeah. Not necessary. Thank you, guys. Hmm. I'm gonna grab this flag right now. Yeah, no. I, like, I asked the question, and my brain then flashed up that answer, and I was like, ah, hmm, hmm. Like, I've run out of this. Uh, nah, we're just meming along. We're not really talking about much. I've discovered why my percentage was going up so slow, so we're currently in the question mark stage of, is this gonna be a 12-hour marathon to 100% the game or not? Because I couldn't figure out why the frickin' game. Oh, we need... Okay, you guys are, like, so close to being maxed out. It's crazy. I'm not gonna send you away for 20 minutes, so do you max out? Yes, we do. The other two, we don't even need to send away anymore. More. Do you need, like, 24 minutes? Nah, you need a bit more XP than that. Got a level 82 XP to it for you. Yeah, that looks like quick math. That looks good to me. My brain was still explicit in the context. No, no, I don't need it. Oh, I need to accept the contract. Actually, oh, I'm gonna send the thieves on this person over here, actually. Actually, factually, as long as you set them on someone, you don't actually have to stick around or anything. I'm gonna grab this feather while I'm at it as well, because I'm really close to it. Right, as well. It's also a feather in the coliseum that you go That's 6 out of 10. Wait, why are you guys still following me? Did you not lure the guards? I guess they didn't activate because they weren't close enough. Wait, do you only lure away stationery guards? Can he be? Oh, wow, I did not know that. I thought you could lure anyone, so I have to pick stationery guards? I have not bought the coliseum. I actually might have enough. Right there. Right there, luring him away. I'm gonna go and get this nation. Oh, a maestro. I saw that. I saw that. I need five assassins to be maestro, and then we'll do some more reblet. You just have to be good at the game. I say you're done. Wait, is this funny? I'm coming for you. Right, I'll send them two together, because they're not ready yet. Uh, no, I keep forgetting to accept the fricking contract. Hi, hi, hi. Yes, yes, yes, but you don't need to tell me. Right, what's the mission assignment? Make a nice and easy peasy. Finish the memory within two minutes. Where am I supposed to go? Do I need to go by horse or not? Yes or no? The thing is, you take, like, if you just directly sprint. Yeah, see, this is the problem. All this stuff is in the way in order to get to them in under two minutes. Right, gallop, please. Yeah, okay, okay, faster, faster, faster. Yeah, okay, the horse was definitely the better bet. You could not run that. And just says do it in under two minutes. So yeah, what are you? Oh, they're on horseback. No, that makes fighting so annoying. Oh, sorry, I've got an itchy nose, so if my tracking goes away, it's for my 90s. Okay, okay, so glad I took the fricking horse. Holy crap. Okay, that's it. It's just so easy. It's just so easy. It's so good. Like, I love these missions. Holy crap. I had no idea how easy they were. Oh, excellent. And it's like that. Literally a minute to spare. Another one. Another one. Oh, do you want to come with me? We'll distract some guards. I should be so close to doing the distraction on. Okay, there's a guard over here. Actually, I need to walk around. I might distract. I didn't do anything. May I ask that? Time to perish. Are you ready? Oh, is it because I had the weapon out maybe? Yeah, I literally did not know. So the good thing with the mercenaries, if you walk around with them to the next location, you can keep setting them on new people to attack, so I'm just going to bring them with me. And once they've attacked 10 people, then we have done that section of the mercenaries challenge. Do you think Margaret Thatcher effectively utilised girl power by funneling money into the game? I'm just here to play video games. I'm quite happy to admit that this topic of conversation is completely out of my knowledge realm. No, I've never played it with monsters. I always play vanilla. I prefer to play games vanilla to appreciate the way that the development team made it. A lot of people don't like vanilla Skyrim, and I'm so sorry, but I just enjoy it. I didn't know because I played on Xbox. I didn't know that on vanilla Skyrim because I was on Xbox that the little dots on the floor were daisies and grass until I played on PC for the first time. Oh, oh, oh, is it, am I pooping or is that mud? Why are they insisting on walking into me, honestly? I just tried to watch A.G's stream, A.B's stream, but I'm deaf in my left ear, so it went silent for 10 seconds in my right ear. But you heard that? I'm like, I don't know. Oh, bless you. What happened? Were you born like that or did you get tiniest? Are they still not done with that fight? Oh, the guy went back on his horse. I was actually going to send him on him. Oh, they're still fighting. Come on. It's just one guy in armor. Oh, come on. You can do it. I believe in this. Horses kicking. Literally. I've never, I've never had the horse being pushed into the floor. Come on, mercenaries. Come on. One of the, yeah, there you go. Geez. Right. We're going to set him on this guy now. The Guardia. Oh, they're beating that horse up. I don't know how many mercenary challenges are completed. All their stuff is like weapon based or doing something impressive or winning. We're going to say, do you guys need help? I think they need help with him. Okay. They definitely need help with him. Yeah, from done. Thanks guys. Glad I hired you. Bought some bought things. Taking so long. I know. I've almost done like sending the mercenaries on people at least. Is this like five maybe? If they could just perish them a bit faster, you know, we can be there. Literally, I'm like just hooded man on horse since four men to fight. Ten years working around engine rooms. Oh, no. That's like the quickest way to lose here. It's like works like that. Okay. Maybe not. Why are messages disappeared? Mozio feeling okay? Am I going crazy? Rubber room. I'm rubber room through the rest. Oh, right. We're almost there. We're almost there. Right. Fight him. Fill them off the horse or something. This is going to take forever. Is there like another mercenary group right here? Yeah. Okay. Can I have you? And then can I send you to fight this group that's already fighting? It works. Okay. Now they're completely outnumbered. That must be what? Six now? Only four more to go. I'm born deaf on my left ear. Perfect for sleeping because I sleep on Marisa. Okay. Now, follow me. So this will be seven? Oh, for goodness sake. That's taking forever. I'll do that though. Because it's when you send them, they don't have to win the fight. It's just when you send them on people. Actually, you know what? I'm just checking. I'm just checking. I can't take this anymore. Gale challenges. Mercenary? Nine? Okay. Guards killed Will on horseback. Brutes killed. Scaffolding. Guards on horseback. Ares assassinated? That must be done from a certain location. Yeah, double assassinations. Three out of ten. I can hardly get it done. Court is on. Nine. Oh, guard's poisoned. It's 15, so I do need to go poison a ton more guards. I assume if they hate each other, then I don't care. Okay, thieves on our entrance. Leaves of faith, I need a 20. Guards are assassinated from a mini. I just need to find one enemy. Hello, you are enemy. And fight. Okay, finally. That took so long. Hiring discount earned a little bit. Hello. Man, look at his fresh cut on that beard. Look at that angle. Is that even possible back then? I was really dumb, but like before razors were invented, did guys just like shave their beard on rocks and stuff? Like, I know that sounds really silly, but did they like fashion a rock to be sharp? And then that's how you got rid of your beard? Or did like everyone just have beards back in the old days? The razors weren't a thing. Maybe glass. It was 100%. Kill by air assassination. Sheave with swords. Not like before that kind of thing. Oh, wow, it's such a good far way. Maybe a horse again. I'm tired of thieves. They may be able to keep up. I'm fucking do a lure away the guards. Thank you. We're getting there. We're getting there. We're getting there. I'm getting stuck on a rope. They shave with knives. They just go to homies to scratch their beards off by hand. That sounds painful as anything. Shave with obsidian. Guys still did. Okay, what am I supposed to do here? Oh, air assassination. Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb and see the guys probably up in this building then since it's all red. Hmm. I'm not gonna be discovered, am I? Hello. Goodbye. Actually, I need to start looting bodies because I'm getting low on supplies, because I'm wasting them all. Okay, air assassination. Let's give it a shot. Where is he? Gee, I wonder where it's air assassination. Oh, I just called him a horse doing that. I need to get away. That's why I called him a horse. Gee. I haven't drawn his mug on two monitors as overwhelming. Wait until I make hypnosis. I'm so excited to make my first one. I don't know what to do. I was gonna do a like free thing. God, these missions are so good and easy. I can't get over it. I'm not doing the Naruto. I'll keep doing the Templar Agents because it's starting to get like less and less. Copernico is a nightmare. If I remember correctly, Copernico is like throw yourself across the city as fast as you can type missions, which I despise. And like it really does not give you like much time at all. So I'm not looking forward to doing Copernico. No, I don't need the body, but thank you. Hello, horsey. Are you ready? Mount. Mabos. Mabos. Well, the horse, please think of Mabos. Speaking of, are you going to collab with Secret Subject? I haven't reached out yet. I know Secret is like super busy. Like she's got like the new VTuber model and everything going on. And I don't want to be like a bother, like harassing anyone. I might get the boss to reach out, but at the moment, like I've actually got quite a lot of people that are interested in collabs with me. And I'm going to try and like not take too much time. Like I say, she says that she plays on stream for 12 hours and literally has like folk waiting on her right in the script. So it can be sent off. Well, that was. But I don't want to send you away. Can I send? I'm so sorry. I think I need a drawing. I think it's time. The problem is that I take like five minutes to generate one. I really don't want to go. I know it didn't happen yesterday, which I'm really happy about, but I think it's happening. Oh, wait. Sorry. Oh, sorry. I need to go into an emergency meeting with one of the girls over something. But I'm like 90% sure I can feel my organs shifting around. I have no coin on my corpse. I can hear them behind me. That's actually pretty scary. No. Oh, no, no, no. I mean, doing this, I will take advantage of the smoke because we need to kill enemies in smoke. Right, they can all just fight each other. Oh, I need to go through the most. Any idea when the first hit in the stream, I'll do my job. It's time is my biggest problem. Like if we end up doing that 100%, I don't know if it's possible. Then I probably won't do it tonight. Needy streamer. I need to go out and buy American sweets for this hand cam stream and clean up my desk because it's an absolute mess. And get like a nice cute outfit and all that. It's just time, honestly. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm not interested in making it. It's just time. I've got these Ace Mark gloves and girls are waiting on me. And then I'm sending away shorts of the girls to be made to Clippers because I didn't want them being stressed out, having to organize this stuff. I guess it's just trying to settle in right now, but I hope to have some consistent stuff. That's free to access. I do want at least something decent free to access on the alt because I don't think it's fair, especially for people that just simply don't have the money. I completely understand. Don't ever feel bad if you're unable to just straight up give money to streamers or anything like that. Like any of the viewers. I am 100% can say right now that all the girls feel the exact same way as me. If you can't afford it, please don't feel bad. Literally watching, liking, commenting, flipping if you want, liking a tweet. All of this stuff is free to do. Like that helps us beyond words. So don't ever feel inclined and like thank you for respecting that there like is a paywall and some of the content because obviously the girls need to eat and they need to thrive because if they don't like thrive monetary wise, then obviously they're not going to stick around a veiler. Why would you? So like I do appreciate everyone's like complete understanding around it. Um right, where's the source? I am actually unironically stuck. Where the heck am I going? Over the bridge? Over the bridge? Over the broken breed? The girls are doing great. Don't worry. No, not over the broken bridge. Don't be fooled by the map. It's not that old. How do I get down though? I always have that problem whenever I come up to this section. You have to like all of your breath around. We're already lucky and spoiled with what you've done for us already. No need to rush, yeah. Like I know some folk are noticing like oh all the girls aren't posting anymore and it was like yeah the girls are live streaming now they're preparing for streams. They're thinking ahead like they got stuff to do now. Before the only stuff the girls could do was meme in the discord with each other and muck about on twitter and pre-record audios you know and now they've got so much to deal with and contend with so yeah. What am I doing? What am I doing before I mess up? Kill your target? Why is this game so good? These game missions are so good. It's actually making me angry. I have nice interfaces. No, I do understand that some people like complain to complain. That's okay. That's just how some people are. Like it's how they like get you know like stressed out. It's therapeutic to kind of have a mooper whatever. It's a lady killer. Okay I need to chase. Stop chasing me. No you like it you little rascal. You're teasing me. You're a leaky. I don't know what that means. They didn't put the subtitles in. Stop it. I love a good glitch. I love a good glitch. I love a good glitch and that helps me get the objective. I love that. That was good. Just do that again. Honestly renaissance outfit starting to grow in me. It's kind of renaissance influence outfit maybe. Someone suggested a design which was uh was it an aristocrat? Vampire? No it was a smug aristocrat. I'm very like posh hoity toyy looking. The only problem is they would have to be brish because if there were any other I was about to say if there were any other gender it doesn't work. If there were no brish I was like oh Christina available. Wait what's her DNA if Christina is available? I'm not questioning it. To Christina we go. Any other gender than brish? Well that child was like okay thanks brain. Strony. Yesterday don't follow lady who and also me. No no no no I like that. It's a lady assassin though. Only I am allowed to raise lady assassins. Okay I'm coming Christina because I have no idea what the heck that you're freaking storyline is. All right I need you guys because you guys I need to lure away guards with can I technically get you guys to- well why am I- right I guess not. There should be some guards coming up. Good they can run fast they're keeping up with a horse practical. Thank you. Lure them away. Aristocrat with a Jordy axe. Wait how is this all spun about when it comes to the section of the map it's terrible. I think it's on the side. Stuck their anger. Goodness me. I just can't even get this right. I cannot have gone there on you. From the rang way? You rang? You're the one that's now- oh excuse me you're in my way. I could have sworn there's a cape that makes guards ignore you unless you like straight up attack them. I need to put them to that. I don't know what cape that is. Oh wow I think that's five one two. I'm just gonna send them away for money because I think we actually might have enough now. For- for what? For buying everything yet. Right Christina my love thank you for unlocking because we were genuinely also confused on what a bizarre ending your storyline had because that didn't make any sense and you know it didn't so what on earth are we busy? Oh no. Oh no I think we're going to the fair. Do you get an EC mod for your pretty extreme? Maybe put like an assassin screen hood on me. So there's gonna be an assassin screen. I've never thought about that. Maybe I should get Ezio's outfit and like- but like you know get the- get like red lacy underwear and stuff. Leonardo. Perhaps it would have been better not to tell you. She's with her husband. She may not be too happy to see you. No it's wonderful. It's carnival. With these masks she will not even know it's me. I know just the way to draw her attention. Oh he's not over her. He's heartbroken. That's so sad. I can't remember what we have to do here though. Oh there she is. I'm to tail her. There she is with her other hussies. I'm just so interested in these masks. She just got to circle? Wait what was it? Am I supposed to do something? Oh plan a letter on her. I beg your pardon. I was like why did she just go on a circle? Okay that makes much more sense. Way more sense. Okay the rendezvous. Don't mind me. Wait she reciprocates. Um It's you that's wrong. This is it's you. Oh It's been eight years? I was afraid you wouldn't come if I just asked. It was the right thing to do. We loved you. Who cares what he wanted? I love you. You had your second child. Please that's it. It got worse. Why did we do this? Why did we play that memory? It got worse. Is that where it ends? That was even worse. Why did we go away? Why did we go further? There has to be another one. There's no way. It got so much worse. That was terrible. Oh Shot through the heart. True. That got even. I don't know why. Like I don't know why I thought that memory would like oh that's gonna be so much better than the last one. No. No no no no no. That's terrible. Well she said don't find her again but I'm left unsatisfied. I feel like that's such a short memory that's not like the true ending. Right we're gonna upgrade our assassins just because we have the thing. I'm not bothered about the thieves honestly. I have quite a lot of money though. Good on Christina for not being a cheater. Literally like when when she was like oh husband's name. I was like wait Etsy planted the lair and like ah what a mess Etsy. What a mess you've got yourself into in a pickle. Yeah he sucks when it comes to romance. Like everything is permitted. Goodness gravy. Welcome to the Brotherhood. Yes. Did I get the thing? Hmm. Suspend points. Assassins Guild challenges complete. Okay. Uh oh Guild crest stop. Is there something new around here? This? We get little things. We get trinkets. Oh my god this game. I'm sorry this game was made for girls. You're telling me. I get a little sim and I get to put it in my little house. My little assassin house. Okay sorry I love this game so much. How did it know? How did it know I was a girl? Good night. Rest well. See you in the morning. Gender norms go hands my goodness. Ah right I don't really want to start Copernicus. We'll go buy the Pantheon. We'll go buy this because we literally do have a I'll check the bank in case any interest is made. Accessories clear. I can't believe it. I can't believe I get to decorate those assassins freaking hideout with my guild crests for all my hard work. Ah. We know the target audience. Honestly is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood a girls game? The only reason I say that is because it's like such a good game. Like it doesn't it's like so hard to get like genuinely to get stuck in like at any part is next to impossible. Oh I need poison guards actually. I'm just gonna like muck about and I don't want to poison like anyone in front but I think they need to like pass away from poison or it doesn't count because I'm pretty sure of poison quite a lot now. Game's so good it breaks the gender barrier. Why is this one so goofy looking honestly? Wait are you saying if it's easy to make friends? I mean I don't know. I feel like whenever I see like a guy review a game it's always like I love the challenge of this game. I love having to repeat the same thing like 12 times over until I got like unspanked and like I figured it out and I'm like I just want to chill experience like make it through the story mode and have a good time and like yeah I'm just a bad gamer that wants indie games. Not a free game journal. I feel like Brotherhood is such a great game that boys angry. My little cousin played it after watching me play it so there it is. Then you gotta love Dark Souls. I mean it's basically what you- no Dark Souls is the opposite of what I described and I know for a factoid it is because I have had the pleasure of playing Elden Ring with the Reeflings and the truth you want the truth I don't think you can handle the truth. I would not have been able to complete that game on my own like I just don't see how I could have done it without all the help of the Reeflings. That's the truth you think you can handle the truth. I'll just poison them one at a time. I think I need to wait until they expire as well which is the biggest problem. You're just like your hand being held didn't you? What do you mean that like all these people are being so nice to me and helping me through my game and I get to reward them? Maybe I should do that like every time we do like a game where you guys hold my hands like I do a reward audio for it and then like my set like when I'm you know doing the ending part of the reward I'm like thank you for helping me thank you for helping me thank you for over me and then then I pop. You know that's terrible I know. Can you poison on horseback? It says shoot. No you can't poison on horseback. Spank in that horse jeez. I'm not gonna hang around until I need him to expire. I wouldn't be opposed. Wait we played what? Uh Elden Ring. Elden Ring's a really good game to carry. I think I want to carry you. It's a beautiful stream and strong ease so dumb to play. Hey streamer I think I want to carry you. They're all looking in opposite directions so I can maybe do two. I can maybe do three if I get this guy. Oh no I can't they're both. He does his hands. They'd be amazing. Games should have some challenge though. Yeah no I do agree there definitely should be like some consequence or else if you don't feel like any pressure to do anything then you don't enjoy the game like it's really hard to nail what kind of dynamic that you wanted. Like oh I'm in trouble I'm sorry. I am a naughty assassin. I didn't hate well enough. Unless don't don't don't. Oh don't push me. Get poisoned. Plap plap plap. Get poison get poison poison. Everyone's getting poisoned around here. Oh please spin that pole around. There we go. Okay I managed to replenish a ton of poisons which is good because oh hello. You're going in the well for thieving from me. Goodbye. Um you can come out now. It's okay I'll come get you. I did not mean to do that. I don't think his life should have been forfeit but I mean was it kind of deserved? I don't know. Everything that was a bit morbid I'd say I'm gonna be honest I actually didn't expect that. Please mummy don't poison my iron brew. Have a can iron brew in the fridge. Right it ages ago and I'm still not sipped up. I need like the perfect meal. I miss British fish and chips so much. I'm sorry to any Aussies listening. Your fish and chips are rank. Okay I did the courtesan. Can I poison? Can I like poison all you guys and then push it all away so you don't do that fighting thing? I hate when they do the fighting thing. I think if they like hit each other with the swords it doesn't count as poison so I'm gonna try and separate them. Oh he just did it there. No I tried. I don't want to leave the vicinity too quickly for the poison but something. Hey I'm not gonna find it with fish and chips around here. Yeah Aussies use shark and like I think it's called gummy shark. It's not actual shark meat it's just a fish. How do you call Germans Scottish? Oh there we go we did the poison gourd. Rank five courtesan. Did I say courtesans poison people now? Ladies. Am I in Australia forever? I highly doubt it. It's very good to run a business from Australia compared to the United Kingdom but oh no you're saying get down to me but not to this wife over here. What's he gonna say? No are you doing me? Um yeah it's good to run a business in Australia but I can't see myself being here forever. I've fallen from my share of rooftops. I'm waiting for my lance. Up here. He left me after our baby died. Joined up with the Chento of Keegan. They say he kills now pushes men from buildings. I tell them I don't believe it. The British use haddock is a delicious fish. What will you say when he comes? Are you in Australia? Heck yeah I am. I'm doing uh I'm making a call. My death will remind him of the man he once was. I'm gonna do a VTuber meet and greet in Australia. I did not look at what the hundred percent thing was. Oopsie. Hold her head a guy. You will travel you no more Madonna. Madonna. What's hundred percent? Kill your target with a hidden blade. Why is this mission type so so perfect? So Imburgh was well with fish and chips then. Kind of. I don't know what the best takeaway, maybe unironically a Chinese but like a British Chinese. Oh I think I need to chase this guy from the rooftops. I think yeah. It's giving chase from the rooftops. What do you mean merda? Get bonked. Hidden blade hidden blade. Lock on to him at least. Exhale don't be afraid. Exhale water. Exhale. The only thing I despise is when you have to do like assassin. Can you come here? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? No. No. No. Come back. Come back. Come back. Come back. Can I knock him off? Why are you trying to hit the ear? You know full well what I'm aiming for it. So like genuinely. Oh goodness sake. Stop moving a bit. Just accept your death. It's over for you buddy. Stop it. I'm actually getting teased. Stop it. There we go. My goodness. My tummy hurt. No more food. No more have you eaten too much. Can't forget. Have you had any encounter with the local fauna? Ah magpies. I have befriended wild magpies. Although I saw my first snake in a cockroach. Oh my god. There's no such thing as cockroaches in Scotland. And I met my first and a possum. Oh my god. Possum are terrifying. I don't like. I thought they were cute. The noise they make at night is like a very scary. Not a fan. Not a fan. Yeah. I had my first cockroach encounter and I'm like I want to go back to Scotland right now. Thank you very much. Because oh my goodness. Possums are harmless if you leave them alone. Yes. I accidentally ran like into one. That sounds really dumb. But my cat escaped the garden and I had to go into my neighbour's garden. And it was one o'clock in the morning and thank goodness I'm no in America because I probably would have got shot on sight. Oh I'm in trouble. And it was absolute nightmare. It was freaking so dark and I had to run around to get into my neighbour's garden and there was a possum that was eye level on the fence. And both of us basically like both me and the possum were like but yeah I had to dive into my neighbour's garden. I'm wondering to throw my cat back over the fence. Yes Gimli. I'm talking about you. Don't do it again. I never want to be in that situation again. I had to stick a letter through the freaking mailbox being like I am so sorry if you heard any of that. Ruckus last night. That was me. No one tried to steal from you. And like I had to sign it with my freaking address and everything. Her name is Gimli. Yes. Because she's Ginger. She's got ginger on her so I named my cat Gimli. So when I pick her up I go that's my wee laugh. Gimli. Excuse me. You said well the thing what it was literally 1am and like they're creak they had the creakiest gate ever and I'm like I'm like Gimli. Gimli get here. Gimli get here right now. Gimli. And because she had never been outside the garden before and she got really confused and was meowing at the door of the neighbor instead of coming back over the fence to me like I had been calling on her for ages and I was trying not to wake up any of the neighborhoods like the neighborhood area. Donut was the man that I met him a long time ago. I was like Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli. Kill only Donut though. Big Donut. Where can I find you? Thank you. Nobody. No, like unironically I had to toss Gimli back in the garden. And yeah she's not here and the music's gonna do the thing. I love the pickup of the music. Oh my god veterinary care though in Australia is so fairly priced and so good. My baby boy he ended up injuring himself on something mysterious and he had a cut on his leg and I phoned up a vet and they were like oh we offer up a pickup service for animals and I'm like well I don't drive so that's perfect thank you. I don't understand how you can do that though. Wait I need to kill all my him. Simple. You can bowl a cat. What? Where are my field workers at? But yeah they phoned up I'm like my baby boy's got a cut on his leg I don't know what happened. Can I book an appointment? I was gonna have to put him in a taxi with me. Wait wait wait just becoming almost. None to miss. Don't hurt anyone. Excuse me good sir I need this horse. I need the horse. Please give horse. Horse now. Thank you. Bye. Ow ow ow. Horse horse come. Let me on you. No don't hurt anyone. Don't don't hurt anyone. Don't hurt anyone. Don't hurt anyone. Don't hurt anyone. Don't hurt anyone. Nice I'm coming in my own horse this is gonna be ridiculous. No don't run away. Don't run away. I need on the horse. Right let's go. Okay we did it. We're safe. Oh we're safe. Are they chasing? Oh they're chasing. Oh okay okay I've run. Sorry sorry sorry. I know which way to go. Sorry sorry sorry. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Come through. Excuse me. Uh right. Which path does indices not normally take? Like this one I guess. Okay. Have we lost them? Like we're we're going pretty far now. I'm still going. Still going. Can I go down here? Oh we did it. Okay I'm fine. We took a neighborhood cat since you're going to fight in Toro Fathom. Yeah like literally the health, the veterinary care in Australia is so cheap and good. And they were like oh we can like pick up your animal and I'm like oh yes please. And I was expecting like $800 or something and it was like super cheap and they were so nice and like it was so quick into when I adopted him that I was like I'm so sorry I have absolutely no idea what the temperament he's going to be like please be careful he might be aggressive like I don't know how he's going to act and they're like oh he was just like a sweet little angel and I'm like oh thank you I'm so glad. So what happened next with Gimli? Oh well through back over the fence and now she's not allowed outside without me being with her because she's a silly silly sausage and gives me a heart attack. I unfortunately live like on car roads. Actually one thing I'll complain about Australia is residential areas don't like have a speed limit or the speed limit is ridiculously high and I'm not being funny the speed of freaking cars is ridiculous over here it's very Americanized sorry sorry to like be mean and stinky because I should be really thankful like that I even have like the ability to like basically like check out another country and type thing like I should be grateful and all that but it doesn't mean I'm not allowed to complain so I will complain um but I'm trying to think that once hold on. So you did literally what she did was climbed up a tree and jumped over a fence so I basically now she didn't get hurt before anyone's like oh my god you're was it a linear whatever her name was 2.0 or whatever no I put her back on the tree like I like shuggled her back on the tree and then I knew she was back in the garden and then I had to run around and go back in like in a my garden and bring her back into the house and obviously she was on time at like she wasn't not allowed outside for a couple of days after that we know you never helped me yeah oh sit in the chat for me while you go home you go into a car crash listen to she be you're joking you're joking you're in a car crash you heard it here for violor is causing people serious damage to their health you've heard it here first

I'm grabbing my cup of tea and I'm going to make a honey tea, I'll be back in like literally a minute. I think that was already boiling. I'm going to make a honey tea, I'm going to make a honey tea, I'm going to make a honey tea. Well, I have absolutely horrific news, I've not got any tea bags left, there'll be no honey tea for me and this has shot me, that was a moment for me to, I'm so sorry if you dropped in on that moment, we all collectively went for the adjubi, I can't believe I'm freaking out with tea bags, I'm so annoyed at myself, I'm going to like, the one thing I do like about Australian supermarkets, they have big like, eh, stuff, oh my, calibration is off, hold on, there, that's my calibration, I don't know why I was looking all the way up, I have no idea if we're going to be able to do this, do you want people to tell you when the other girls go live or when you ask for it, please always tell me when a girl goes live, I can't always keep up and I suck, right, I am not to be tech tech, interesting, if I'm not to be detected, wait what am I supposed to do though, locate the architect, but don't be detected please, okay, um, I, there's two together, how am I supposed to navigate, hmm, you play some games where you versus a chat and hypnotise and so you went honestly though, I wanted to do an IQ test and then I want to chat to do an IQ test, like we would do a poll for what the answer is and see what like the results are, I am very confused, are they going to spot me, wait, what, I love all the bugs in this game, full stop, I just love them all, game, don't be detected, then hmm, why is that man on the roof, how bizarre, wouldn't work, we make you work for victory, oh no, you guys are allowed to win, I wouldn't cheat to do it on the IQ one, but I forget it's a stream where I make the album, where the heck am I supposed to go, I assume I'm allowed to kill folk, I feel like I need seven bolts, am I going crazy where, is he over there, is that him over there, I'm, I'm having a, well, I don't have a choice, yeah I was going to say I don't have a choice, because he was coming into the hay bale anyway, lower score is better right, I'm going to be number one, chat's IQ is room temperature, but that's why we're so good for each other, we're so bad, am I tracking funny with you, I think, oh my tracking is funny, I fucking hate this iPhone, for some reason, sorry that got really aggressive out here, whenever it is horizontal, it does not track me full stop, horizontal, vertical, no, when it's vertical it works, when it's horizontal it doesn't, but I need to charge it while I stream, and it's awkward to put it vertical doesn't it, is my tracking being rubbish all day, I'll just over enunciate my word, though you guys, I don't know where this enemy is, genuinely, I guess I can do this kind of stuff, and loot the bodies, could you get some sort of tool to grip it and hold it in there, oh, so it's on like the world's tiniest tripod which is adorable, I'm so confused, honestly, I don't know where this person is I'm supposed to be trying to find him, I'm going to loot these bodies and hopefully get more supplies, because one poison, one medicine wasn't as cool, please expire so I can loot your body, sorry, okay there we go, to be honest it's hard to tell if the tracking is off or not, since we don't have a reference, alright let me build my webcam let's, where is this overseer, is he like in, is he below the church or something, is he in it, is he the one by the hay bale, he can't be, um, have I been everywhere yet, I don't know, so those were the ones that caught me on the outskirts, is he in the center and that's why, no, what, what, did I just, is he like walking around and I just can't tell, yeah the game's telling me to stay in this section, I'm on podcast unless as long as it's your birthday, love cuteness is smaller they are, the cuter they are, true, I'm, I'm one confuzzled girl, look at that, I think we're just going to have to literally go around the map and clean it up, because this is, use eagerness to differentiate, yeah but I don't know what to tell you, nothing is being highlighted, oh there's guards coming, no they stopped, we're checking the hay bale, they're like, those guards from down there coming closer or no, yeah, we will shoot them with poison, oh like the game keeps telling me but I don't know what to tell you video game, I've literally been to all sections of this map, wait that didn't happen, okay, I hit him that time, I'm going to loot their bodies to get all the supplies, we'll meet them first, closer to the larger area, is your target in the building? more poison there, the one thing that I'll say is a bit funny in this game, NPCs will walk into guards that are like flailing about and it's like bro, hopefully I can get more ammo off these guys and I'm not spending more, I'm getting more poison back which is fine, I'm spending poison, it's good to get poison back but my goodness, okay, so he does just roam the map, okay, all those guards, I don't want to be these things because I stopped, I didn't realize he turned back, I'm very confused with this mission so like I had to find him walking around and there's guards everywhere, I'm going to go on the roof because there's that rotating jewel here, there's, oh maybe a desync if he notices that people are ill with poison, I don't know, beat up the architect, hopefully this gives me a loading point, give me the plans right now, oh yeah, honestly me, that took so long to progress, I do apologize, that must mean painful, right so what happens now, I'm notorious, okay I can deal with that, I've definitely progressed to the next loading screen so again we've not failed 100%, do not get shot while using the bomber, surely I will do this first time when I get on the bomber, surely I will not have any issues at all and I'm not going to be frustrated with this game mode, I'm already preparing for it, can I launch on that, oh it hits you over there, oh sorry, I need to impair sleep right now so don't get caught, now I have the interest, surely absolutely helping copium right, next loading point please, oh I'm at, I'm to not be detected by the two guards that are across from each other, yeah I'm not to be detected by the two point blank guards, I can do this if that citizen doesn't get in the way and then he will be distracted by him, I said he will be distracted by the poisoned guy, can you, oh and now everyone's in the way, get the fuck out of my way, Jesus, I know why they make the minstrels like that but they've made them a little too well, okay they've made them a little too well, okay yeah my tracking is like bugging out because it's horizontal, I despise you, there's no way or maybe it's the iPhone, hold on, let me cook for the thing, I'm trying to see if I can stand up on it so I have my elaborate setup from yesterday because I removed all the cups from my ring look at the mask, when I have the perfect setup, that looks much more, okay and then we'll look for supplies, the per NPCs, I just know we're gonna fail this and I'm gonna be so mad because I don't know what to expect these poison darts for distraction is absolutely gorgeous, these NPCs in my fucking way, not gorgeous okay he's gonna start attacking, I can see the ones coming down the hill I don't know if they're gonna, oh no, oh no they got attracted, I'm just gonna hide in here unleash the archers, you're evening skulls, I'm nervous I don't know what to do here I'm just kind of waiting around, like waiting for the EI to kick in so I don't know what to do now oh yeah, that must have been drinking the good stuff okay, we're just gonna poison them both again, like literally poison darts don't be afraid to lock onto them when they can see us, no it's fine, honestly don't be afraid no, miss, shit, we cannot be missing poison darts, no, next one, use the other guy okay there we are, we're gonna loot these two bodies so we can refill our poison we're taking it nice and slow, should charts start logging every bird, nah okay these are both poisoned, again we're gonna pick up, we're just gonna take it nice and slow you know, we don't need it too fast, just relax, calming, cozy atmosphere but remember, don't get shot when we are in the glider and I know I'm going through these things I'll still finish it anyway but oh yeah, wow, you get a lot more from them, okay I'm quite happy with that she be redirect, oh no, they're all gonna see my terrible gameplay and me getting mad now they're gonna know I'm a terrible gamer nice cozy atmosphere, remember the guys gagging and choking on the background, literally I'm gonna just move a whistle through my teeth there your gameplay isn't terrible, it's rough on the DLC stuff cause like I don't know, there's anyone up here oh my gosh I've just remembered how humongous this is, we have to get up there but we have to go like and do all this dodgy stuff constant back and forth oh no oh no no, he can't see us again, he needs to forget about us like right now he needs to like, okay wow, that was dangerous hold on, I think we'll be in best, get by another guard there's one in there yeah and he's moving out, oh there's two of them, we're investigating the bodies I don't want to go down, I'd rather stay on the walls and go around to this tower stuff oh my goodness, she be caught and bummer self, thank you for the wade how is your stream, are you steaming, please drink water please drink lots of water, my dear, we don't want any hangovers she be and Emmy wait, both Emmy too?

that was pretty quick that was pretty rough, Jesus I private it over for you, ah, I should have gone let's see, let's do poison oh let's not do poison again she be making a smart move, 5 head now this is so sad, I'm only good to see half of it there's always more ASMR streams to come in the future, don't worry it's not one and done we ain't one and done around these parts hopefully YouTube gets her stuff messed there's a few things going on with YouTube right now this is a very slow based mission by the way because every time we poison, I have to wait until they're perished and then I have to loot them and then I have to go for the next part I don't know if I can reach him from here just out of sight, but I need him gone I need him gone or I can't be jumping around this tower he's got a range of these guys, but I'm not with him Strani, you're always streaming, are you okay? ah, yeah, it's called I am sharing my childhood games and I love them and I want to share them it's a bit more cozy the day yesterday I was a bit, can he see me? he can man needs glasses I mean, whoever will literally leave you up true lovely, lovely stuff we will be taking this very easy I am not sure how to get down out of safety, we're going to be doing a lot of poison right now I don't know if I can leap from there to that and I don't want to risk it that looks like a leap over, definitely like that 100% looks like a leap over they're currently poisoned below me but I should be safe to make my there's a lot of red there I think this is definitely what I'm supposed to do though a 12 and a 6 hour plus stream on your first week is awe inspiring I just really enjoy these video games I definitely will be focusing please don't think my streams are all going to be 18 hours tomorrow's needy streamer overload I've never played it before, but it's definitely going to be a shorter stream because I don't even know if I like it and whenever I have the what happens if I spin around a beam and a neat poison, these two down here not risking it not risking it at all we have come too far right onto the beam I'm just going poison route because poison stops them from being able to see me I'm going to loot this guy's body because archers normally have a lot more stuff on them cuttlefish are venomous there is one cuttlefish that's venomous but my ink isn't venomous it's an aphrodisiac it puts you under my alluring spell what is bro doing with poison though the lead artist for needy streamer overload is one of my favorite artists I'm a sucker for oh his son she booties stuff right we need to be super careful because this is the most ridiculous thing for trying to spot enemies there's like guys all the way up this tower and it's so hard to know when one's about to see you and I'm not freaking redoing this all over again but I'm getting scared okay I can see one guy up there it must be they're all on the roof under your lure not your resa... you might have a streaming edition I can't believe it oh almost fell there you said you might not be able to 100% it there's a few 100% that I genuinely don't know and I'm worried about not being able to do my like I just simply cannot do it and I can't like call I can't tap one of you guys into the game to do it for me so I'm still I'm still not sure this is going to be a 12 hour stream or not I can hear the music how am I supposed to hurt them all at once I don't think I... is that a flag this way? no what? the sun's getting further away uh... why? what am I supposed to do? no! okay okay I understand I thought I was about to be exposed right at the end there right in order to 100% this mission do not get shot while using the bomber okay we have been at this mission for like 20 minutes now all I have to do is nail this off the bat and I don't even remember freakin' doing this I'm going to start sweating okay don't get shot using the bomber why can we not get like a little tutorial first? destroy the workshops I can do that I can do that it's fine tactical camera no not tactical that was awful don't ever do that again press retreat to fire R2 oh no oh my god I'm going down this is not good this is not good oh my god I don't know the controls I don't know the controls oh I don't know where the closest one on the map is it's the one... if I take her right I don't think I'm gonna make it just go for the one that I'm hitting at oh my god there's archer towers no no no no no no no no no how? how? how were you not supposed to get hit by that? oh I didn't even hit that tower yeah see this is what I'm afraid of I can't 100% I'm under the impression I now have to redo this entire entire mission again I missed that again? I'm trying so hard I think I'm gonna have to like go further away I don't think there's a checkpoint I never gave an indication wait for one okay there we go shoot workshop twi- whoa whoa whoa my controller Jesus oh please my goodness I almost didn't make it there alright do that okay then do this and I missed so that's okay we just need to do it go around a bit oh well maybe we're gonna just straight up attack this one I missed hopefully there is checkpoints cause this that does seem very harsh I completely I did I will admit I twided off I need a fire like right now oh goodness me goodness gravy they didn't even make this game easy there we go destroyed that one honestly this section was a lot harder on paper I think there right now what? only if you die you have to repeat whole missions a checkpoint at the start of the bomb destroy the bomber where I see speed run over there can we aimbot it? three two one oh I think that was a miss a swing and a miss swing and a miss hold on let's try again oh wow I cannot control this right now I'm completely looking in the wrong direction I bruv bruv bruv bruv bruv bruv yeah okay controls please thank you oh no there's more okay okay it's okay it's okay I'm just trying to set a fire along the way I am hello game respond please I missed and it's okay it's okay we're gonna bomb that get a bit of speed whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hello game relax relax relax game what on air I thought I don't think whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa bruv\u90e8 game what was that velocity it was completely unnecessary are you sure game put me up put me up put me up put me up I went ups so I can aim a miss oh wow I actually hit that wow that was crazy I don't think I was supposed to fly that high that was Oops played out of order Where's this a horse? Okay? turn around Every now and then I get this. Oh, I was too early. Hmm. Maybe there then Yes Yeah, okay. That wasn't bad. That wasn't horrific Wow That was a crazy boost. I don't think I was supposed to go that high. I think the game mathematics It's weird Okay There's cool guys don't look at back at explosion Well, we did it That was not easy. That was not fast I am going to open it up in the dna sequence to see if it's like replay that section If it is then a hundred percent, it's still on board if it's not then a hundred percent It's like a much less likely because this is getting hard This is getting tricky It's tricky tricky tricky tricky Rock around rock around just right on time. It's tricky The whole thing I was worried it would say that I was so worried it was gonna say that Look we'll do what we can We'll finish the other like Leonardo missions and that But yeah, this is gonna be I don't That has just like dramatically decreased the odds of being able to a hundred percent it like to go through all of that section Again, like I was taking my time like poisoning guards along the way so I didn't have any issues that That one attempt and we got hit immediately that was the only time we got hit as well Which was just so unlucky because I wasn't sure what the controls were Like that was so rough. I just jumped us. Come on that horse And that is why late game gives more check literally that is so Um punishing Wait, can you a hundred percent this game without being online? Yes, the dna sequence is what we're a hundred percent It's like doing a hundred percent of the memories and stuff. I'm currently 63 percent, which isn't bad at all however I was under the assumption the game was a bit more forgiving. However, we've just kind of discovered The replayability checkpoints aren't necessarily all there on certain missions and that is just so I don't know. I don't know Let me see that Okay, go. Yeah. Yeah. Remember trying for platinum to give Achievement wise I don't know if you need a hundred percent dna for the achievements War machines are infamous for a reason. Yeah There's a difference in a hundred to give a hundred percent achievements. Um So, yeah, I thought we could maybe attempt to a hundred percent the dna sequence, but yeah It ain't looking good. I mean, how long oh, it's already been six hours. What the heck? Okay Yeah, I didn't like I thought I was only gonna What was I supposed to do? Use a kick attack against over here. I literally thought Um If you don't do it now move these kids should be a thing you come back to at a later time I think so. I think three days of like Assassin's Creed brotherhood in a row is a bit It's a bit too much, but I'm perfectly happy to like come across the save file. That's not a problem Um Oh, no, no, we're not doing this We're not doing this horse feature, but leave me alone. You're scaring me Oh Oh, whoa, I actually dodged that successfully, but the game said no, so I true love with this game with a hundred percent. Oh steady on have you seen what the requirements are on some of the missions? Oh That a wee bit of a That a wee bit much for me honestly like I love this game But I think, um Definitely Wouldn't mind coming back to to attempt it, but I think three days of Assassin's Creed brotherhood in a row Maybe ain't the choice. We'll try and needy streamer and it'll be a smaller stream tomorrow, which means I can go get the Sweets that I'm using for that hand cam stream. I need to like prepare for it and saw I don't even know what to wear. He he I'm actually gonna have to put clothes on for one Uh, I don't even know And one achievement requires you to reach level 50. Oh, yeah, no, no, not those achievements like the dna Are we going up? cancer crime, which we Have to is a strong word Open one of the first three game the bourgeois have constructed a deadly naval war machine base on the in our design It must be destroyed before chesery Good dreams.

Isn't that a bit silly? I don't even realize I was supposed to be up here Whoa, wait, why can't he see me? I thought we purposely put these beams here so you can't get seen by the guards below Oh Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa my part in my bag I'm gonna do that just so you know, where is it?

Slow it down Literally, I'm trying to like silently swim is not even possible I think if I just hang off the pier and assassinate him, this is the best way forward for this Sorry mate, but time's up Okay, yeah, that's far more easier.

Oh you guys are hurting me You're giving me a booboo Just just a range that was so close Right a little bit of a push I just don't want to get too close to the point where I can't even freaking aim There we go we got there we got them It literally is your tank in all the arrows. Okay, that was kind of for me. Take the way they are jumped off the ship However, they don't want you on you. Honestly, there's literally cannonballs Literally be a BRB. Sorry. I can't aim at your shills. Let me just do a little spin around. Oh Oh, we're shooting at ourselves Wow Oh We actually go 100 sink for that. Okay I used to love this game then you have fantastic taste because this is my number one game of all time and I suck at it New Right, hold on. Is there one more Leonardo mission? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay Uh, how are they always on the opposite place? Right, we're finished this Leonardo and then we'll get the gales faction In Tank tank tank you are good at sucking Sorry, I'm making an animated shot of your reference sheet for the meme tag Should I uh bring in the tweet? Um I don't know if when it comes to memification of something you don't have to credit the original rs I don't know. What do you guys think you're probably better know than me like I did credit her like right under the Thingy so like people know it is by her under the reference sheet like at all times. I don't know These hay bales were soaking So One of the games are the most uh called dynasty warriors ac brotherhood was the last game I truly played in the series Yeah, revelations was all right but It wasn't brotherhood If I had to rank them it's brotherhood then ac2 and then revelations for exo storyline I went on an adventure trying to beat up all oh to beat all of this asca games, but I stopped at syndica. Hmm I think I've played assassins creed three maybe unironically three times. Um It's just no fun ACR had uh fucking turret defense literally the turret defense Do slash credit. Yeah, maybe do slash credit just so it's not like Bothering but the credit is there for people who do want to Yeah, people say they love black flag I struggled so much to get into it But I'm wondering if it's just because I'm like a little cry baby because ac wasn't like in the series anymore Which is very plausible. I wouldn't I wouldn't mind to try and get black flag one more big hood. Uh Um But I just Really seem to struggle with the controls, but it's probably because I'm doing the well I've already played assassins creed. So I don't need to sit and read the controls. Well, obviously they have changed the controls So I'm you've been a quiet boy, baby Valhalla I wish they would make more like story multiplayer games like It takes two It's like such a good story thing And I would absolutely love to play games like that on stream and be like, okay after the first chapter We'll get someone else in okay next chapter. We'll like get someone else in but like they just don't need to do that. They just don't need to do that It's annoying So annoying I can't believe I can't play video games the exact same Exactly the way I want to play them It's such a baby Kill the template overseer to recover map use the pistol a I can do that Oh No, yes, no, yes Yeah, I was gonna see you sure you want to fake this. Oh wow, it's always you guys that want to fake stop this Hawkins and not really I'll see if I can loot a smoke bomb back I've been having a blast watching a veteran in a newcomer play the hero That oh, yeah, the halo campaign is gonna be playable Okay, last one question mark, I think You That's the other mission Halo 3 plugin Is it like safe to do a halo campaign? That would be really cool to do a refling. It's not gonna lie. I'd be pretty hyped for that But I don't know how safe it is to like add people Because I don't think I can just instance and have you guys in It would be pretty pretty cool to like I don't is it joe only or is it four man? Favorite game combat of bill is it evolved or yeah or evolution Oh my gosh, it's john halo from fortnight Lean out his tank is an ambitious and devastating war machine capable do not take any damage well in the tank Yeah, good luck for that. We're not in the fun Have name poison which is decent Yeah, we're not doing that. Um, literally everyone's getting poisoned. I don't care We have name the wash to bought some more at a healer Yeah, maybe if it's safe to add people like on halo then You could do playthroughs of that, but I guess you We could only do a mission by mission. So like we would do one mission and then Kick out and then add and then next mission You know We see nothing How did you guys not sure it's a poison dart so it's supposed to just be like a little swing And no one knows Literally poison is so peefer like when it comes to don't be detected because you can walk right in front of them and Obviously the crossbow does the exact same thing Yeah, poison's cool Oops. Sorry. Sorry. Oh I was pulling down my sleeves. I'm getting uh, that's right.

It's like, oh, I'm so glad you guys put this really arbitrary arbitrary. Okay, really Really premature with that one. I'm not gonna I'm not even gonna. No, no the horse That was uh Let's try that again Yeah, literally. I wish the NPCs would actually calm down about my rely. Oh, no I honestly, I'm not sure how I'm getting it sometimes and not other times My only guess is that an NPC is making it so like pathing mess up Jump hold What is going on What is going on? I'm not actually sure why sometimes I'm getting that right We'll do a really big run up just because we can Okay, so run and then stand and then jump and hold. Okay. Okay. It's speed. It's speed. We need it We need a bigger run up 15 more times 15 more times. Okay big big long journey one two three four five jump and hold 15 is still the number. We can't do it. This is not at all A bit of a grind. I don't know why so a bit more of a grind than I was expecting. Run And jump and hold I honestly don't understand what's determined in a Maybe do the middle one like jump lay I think you may be right. We'll jump lay on purpose this time. Okay Not doing it. Not doing it. Not doing it. We'll jump now and hold. No Thank you for at least coming back 15 is better than 20 And 14 is better than 15. Whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no No is the appropriate response after seeing that out loud Oh, all right. No, that didn't work Uh, I think I'm getting speed blocked or something Because this is what we're on 14 or 13 no, not 13 close to 13 We can do it. I literally feel like Bilbo Baggins when he's like Uh, he's like trying not to be like a bit. Um, just growing old with like the door showing up And I'm like, oh, it's fine. It's fine. No This is very Maybe you have to be under the beams. Okay, I'll definitely like I'll super delay at this time like genuinely super delay No, he just he just jumped straight on it if you do it like super delayed. Okay Curious curious, right? I'll try again because 14 Like I can do this honestly. It's just so I'm trying to avoid that guy. I try to avoid that guy. I think I just need to let the horse maybe Directly steer even if the horse is a little off because my the steering as soon as I stand on the horse's saddle the steering Oh So I just realized since you're in Australia, does that mean you've been streaming 3m? 4am is my stream time Daylight saving and stuff But it's healthy It's healthy It's it means I can do stuff during the day. Oh 13 13. Okay. I don't know. I genuinely didn't do anything different I think it really is just luck of the draw or something because I did not do anything Ah, I was gonna say hopefully we get to in a row This is such a bizarre like challenge type thing honestly No, why why why? 30 no, not 30 13 Spreads build up just straight up and uh All bits are so like He acts annoyed in the moment. See. Yeah, that was like hardly any build up So I think that's why that one's in the one Mmm, um, let's not be knocking down women. I only want to knock up women. Thank you very much Oh, wait, I don't want to knock down women. I only want to knock them up Please laugh One more time without doing a massive thing Uh Yeah, I forgot I forgot I had it too. Okay. I forgot legit. I'll need to add a laughing track as well. Oh Brother this guy's thanks. Yeah, I'm gonna have to add uh Um, I'll add a laughing track. I should add a laughing track That's like one that's good and then one that's like Uh, I gets a few coughs and like a giggle. So it's like a bad joke. I'm definitely need to get that Hmm I need to hydrate my goodness. I'm like trying so hard to figure out like what's determined in this jump or not I need some crickets. Yeah Do the joke again. I let my laugh in my other jacket Oh, you left your laugh in the other jacket. Ha ha you spelt it wrong Everyone pointing laugh you spelt his thing wrong and I read it out and now he's embarrassed Ha ha ha streamer read out your message with a spelling error. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh that that was just gross Right, okay, we're gonna try gallop now The only issue with galloping is if you gallop through a crowd too much No, that was far too early. Okay. I'm kind of struggled with it. We'll try the gallop from this side It's over. It's over. You'll never recover. Your social credit has been determined No, okay, that gallop doesn't seem to enable that jump whatsoever. I like how the horse is so responsive It's like where'd you go? Please come back Oh, is it the digration? Degoration degradation Degration degradation Degration sounds correct Instead of degradation. Oh 12 I'm just so surprised when it does happen. It seems to happen in that direction more than it happens in this No, look close it's over not quite I do want you on the beans, but I want you to do that We fancy flip that you do they should have made it 10 No, they actually shouldn't have done this all because literally how would you have discovered that it so can even do this? I'm sorry, but I would never have naturally discovered that he could do this Good night. Rest well. Thank you for hanging We're uh Oh, I actually can't see how long I've been streaming for I've accidentally covered it up with my uh Little list of things that I need to do. Oopsie. Whoopsie Oh, that was like really It feels like has cooled down honestly The brain rot took over. Yeah, it took over long ago. I apologize Eight hours. I've only been streaming eight hours. I've got a few more in me I want this one over because I never want to have to do it again Like I don't want to have to come back to this I but I know you guys have been literally watching me do a backflip on do a flip on a horse for like 10 minutes Now it's gonna be just no one's laughing Getting aggravating it right. I am running. I am running. I'm holding Oh 11 Okay, I think it's 11. No, I don't know why right. I'll run up for ages. Hold. No Oh, we're almost 50% of the way there Absolutely Only Oh, well, you guys are gonna feel at a place when you see me only only for like two hours tomorrow You're gonna be like, what's wrong? Is she sick? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, no, you have done 10 10 right. I feel like it always happens come in this direction instead of the other direction I feel like you can't even do a flip. We're not flipping out on you. You're not flipping out on me Insert laugh track here that I still haven't added yet, but I will have the laugh tracks into him Please get the heck out of my way. I'm trying to do You Can you leave me alone? No No money is worth this he said I do need to kill from horseback. So maybe just do that real quick We'll just do this one to add to the horseback one. So we're still making progress even though it's Okay, that's that's the sound I need to add right now But if I do the flip it goes Don't worry, I'll get a little bit for you. I'm dead Flipping on a beam off a whole horse this sucks and I don't know why they asked for 20 Stop taking people's horses. It's really not No, I I'm looking to see if there's like a prompt that's like double tap to do a beam or jump or whatever about No happening, it's no happening, but we're halfway there. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it We do it. We uh, well That's probably not gonna work now. Is it? No I have lost my mind literally I've been doing flips for thanks for so long Please Free me free me from the beam Oh nine finally No, it's you below the beam you could have easily sat back on the horse. I'll be honest The skirt looks so funny. You mean has killed he's killed to kill to pull fun Eight eight eight eight. Okay, that was actually I think I need it. I think I can kill him and it'll count for the horseback Oh, I'm getting a spank. I'm getting a spank. I'm sorry Actually, I should probably do these guys from horseback as well And there we go one Two Three or I'm going to throw rocks through your window All right, let's try this game Oh, no, don't jump no stick Try going try going You mustn't offend the last You wouldn't you like me when I'm angry you can't you oh seven seven seven seven I think seven I still have yet to figure out what determines it but once it's over with we don't have to do it again We got a double. We got a double. We got a double. Oh my god. I've not done that. Can we do a triple? Can we do a triple is like my subconscious understanding what I need to do even though my brain like my actual conscious doesn't No, we got a double though. So it's six only six more to go. I've never done back to that. That's fantastic I was literally I'm like is my subconscious knowing what's up, but my conscious is like Can't that was far too early me put my glicks on for that one. That's terrible Wow, oh baby Top 10 moments Welcome to watch module. Well, we wait the work. We rate the worst Little side quest things that assassin creep brotherhood randomly give you because it is a bit arbitrary Only six more can you hold on for six I'm starting to lose a little bit, but that's okay because we got five we got five I was gonna take it will be be a triple get out of my hand Look, I wasn't kidding when people like why would you just grave she be is like everything you should have been I wasn't kidding. Was that kidding? I was oh four four four You Or Oh We're sounded so country Wow the sound of the ice cream Three three three three three Oh The people listening in right now that are like waiting on mersey start they're like please for the love of god mersey start One more one more one more one more one more One more just one more time. We've got to celebrate. Oh, yeah jumping on the horse beam Do the random say thing for the guilt Oh Don't don't ever be such a silly sausage again and Your daddy your dad says they've gone Don't ever give me such a silly thing again. That was absolute torture Lure guards leap of faith guards air assassinate from a beam No guards Okay, the only thing I can think of doing is attracting these guards over here to no because they would have to be below me Where is a beam that a rider goes past? Because I think that's what I have to assassinate So now forcing around no dive on I Think if I do this I might get the horseback kills I Please come under this beam over here, please harass me under this beam Please harass me under this beam. I can't believe the game literally just train me for this moment Please come under the beam. Please come under the beam. I take all back. I'm sorry these skills I'm sorry Where the heck is this mystical beam that the enemies pass under I don't know where it's located It's not up here doesn't feel like it's up here at all Mission failed you get them next time literally where the heck are these beams? Hardly any beams anywhere The only beam around here is me having a beamer because of how freaking embarrassing this gameplay is To have a beamer means that you are embarrassed and have scarlet face or a red face Oh Just to be Volpe does have missions. I am going to buy ammo and I'm gonna do this stationary guy one because it's really easy to do it in this quest So I'm gonna go by ammo and we're gonna replay a mission that gives us one of these skills requirements Claudia yes, she does as well I'm Try to do sorry who goes there? I think I'm actually gonna have to get rid of my rating What is needy smart overload it is Unfortunately, I actually don't know too much about the game But it might be a good thing because we get to play for fun for the first time I don't think it's gonna be a very long stream if you're wanting an endurance on that I Need to go to the shops to buy the sweets for the hand camswing stream Why am I here? Yeah, sure Well, you're no cheap. Oh, I need to buy are I just realized that yeah, I need to buy like tons of art in all the different districts To three hours. Yeah, that's like the perfect stream Deep gargling didn't overstay as well. Oh, okay. Okay, I did young man with an apple man He's so done. He's like I have enough of posing. Oh, that's a cool one But what art for here, oh wait, I'm like 90% sure you sell failure locations Can you please resell me then No Yeah, the feathers. We'll grab the feathers. I'm sure another's one on the Colosseo Are you gonna hundred percent avatar? No, I've never played the RDA side of avatar. I don't like the RDA side Can I still visit Leonardo? And I don't play the RDA side only play the Navi side and It will just be done the Navi. I think the campaign's like six hours on that one if I can remember correctly We'll be strange not seeing you before bed and waking up after yeah, it's gonna be an interesting day But I do have endurance streams every week kind of planned as long as all goes well I'll see what the clipping situation is Hi Leonardo It's you the people apartments are in turmoil. Yes, it is ill and the pope dead It was your doing was it not Leonardo? I swear to you did not die by my end This world gets stranger every day. I shall have to focus on my painting I work on the small portrait of a woman. I'm growing rather fond of it Do not let a beautiful girl distract you from constructing my designs. I have no worries Women provide little distraction Wait, I don't get it He's a gay boy. It's you. Oh, it's pride month. Can he be like that man? Can he be like that? That's nice. Oh, I have everything I Don't have anything to purchase Leonardo about everything wait if I talk to him again You have all that I can give now. You're on your own. Ah, Leonardo Get back you Give me some of that Good day for catching up on cooking balls and things and no engineering. Yeah And so the clipping situation I don't want the girls feeling stressed out thinking like I have to clip like and stream at The same time and like deal with all this and try and do collabs all the girls and all that And deal with the audios and blah blah blah. So I don't want to stress them out So when you guys like do a make a YouTube clip I can go on their accounts and see what someone's clipped and if it is like clippable Where's a I can then send the timestamp onto like an actual clip editor To make clips for them and I just need to see how it works out in theory obviously when I do endured streams I can't do any of it like right now for them and But we Will see how it goes I don't know if I need to like put out a little ad saying like I need more clippers of this particular style Because there's a particular clipping editing style That I'm looking for the most recent mercy shorts the blonde hair short and the other short of forgotten And is the clipping style so if you really can do that in style You know, don't be afraid to help the website Because that's kind of what I'm needing at this point Good thing. I've got a few clips already My job is not necessary. If you're a general clipper and we do I'm still interested in doing the clipping Enterprise that like I don't end on which is really good Obviously need to get monetized first and set up and see whether my funds and the money looks like and all that and Because will I tell you a really embarrassing fact, you know the earlier like The earlier Clips that came out shorts that were on the girls channels and Amy made two of her a couple of shorts on her own actually But I was editing them and I hated them so much and I was so embarrassed. I was like, I'm so sorry girls This is the best I can do because we had a quite a few issues behind the scenes production wise with timing It was a freaking nightmare and so like all my attention was elsewhere and Like I didn't have time to be like hi clippers. Here's this these files like please wait at them Which that's where I did fail like looking back like obviously I'm happy like talk about like where I failed the girls and like I Definitely feel like I've failed with them on the clips because the actual plan was the count school life for two weeks before stream and there'll be a clip uploaded every day and Like I kind of failed the girls like doing that and I feel really bad about it. I feel wrong But like the dust is kind of set of already done this but the dust is like kind of settling The only bad thing is that for now time zone only you and I see stream at normal times, okay, you may be not in a normal way. Yeah You Do you know like it definitely went well like the absolutely no denying like And I'm definitely not denying like debut went well and everything Just like I had planned things to just be a lot better and obviously it's not realistic to be like all my plans are all I just realized I need to leave the face. We're gonna be jumping off this building for quite well Like I understand it's not possible for everything For everything to like come out the way of my head and Like the girls trailers didn't come out the way I wanted them to And but because of like production issues, I couldn't get things like fixed or altered in time for anything really and it was just like But yeah Yeah, are you winning strong? Yeah, absolutely. Um, are you winning? Excuse me, I'm using this cable. I'm so sorry if this makes anyone motion sick I'm needing to do leaps of faith and if you jump off a pigeon thing it counts as a leap of faith No, it's ill into the hay bed No, it's ill into the hay bed Yeah, it was a timing issue and we love artists in this house we do but and I had given Very I feel I had gave incredibly fair deadlines for what I was asking and Pretty much across the board the majority went over and if you are an artist that worked with me And you did go over deadline like please don't worry and Like it's not like a big deal anymore because obviously now everything's out there and everything's all good and we debuted and like that's That's the facts but I had a lot of delays and Basically, I had planned every month in advance Being like this month. I'll be focused on this this month. I'll be focused on that and what happened was Everything had to be done in May and Like I'm not gonna lie I like cried a few times out of just like pure frustration of like feeling I can't do enough because I have to wait for Someone to send something back in order for me to progress and give feedback like I had a lot of Like issues with People not checking what they gave me the first time around and being like hey the reference sheet looks like this or hey Like the subtitle that you put here and like it's quite clear that she didn't say this But you've literally put it in for some reason or like hey the audio Literally cuts out in the middle of this. Can you re-render like I don't know what like it was It was rubbish and at the same time like obviously the girls know a bit more in detail exactly what I'm talking about and Because like I showed them like we are Like I'm constantly sending back like please fix this please fix this please fix this and the days are going by and the Fixes are taking 24 hours the fixes aren't done within 20 minutes and I get a new rendered version of something It's like no 24 hours. I'll do it in the morning. I'll do it later, and I'm like I have paid premium rates I shouldn't be the one who is quality checking your work. You should quality check it before you send it to me and Like it was just a cascading effect, and it was pretty horrible And But yeah, but we're here now. So and there were so many lessons learned like Rip to future artists if you're interested in working with Veeler, but like everyone's getting contracts like conscripted and stuff like And being like if you miss this deadline like you know it's Just there's just it's not fun being like that like I love giving artists the benefit of the doubt But holy is this even counting for leaps of faith? Yeah Like deadlines are so important and having that like My heck are the leaps of faith here. Oh, wow. We're one off of leaf of faith Literally in the end we made it everything worked out fight. Wait, did that guard hurt himself? and Like we made it in the end, but yeah rough rough Not fun, but I'm now Like I just want to stream. I just want to have fun. I want to show off my games. I want to have a good time I want to make ASMR. I want to do everything that I wanted to do While I get to do it alongside like these amazing girls type thing And I want them to see them achieve their dreams and see how it goes like obviously the the the current goal is YouTube to please stop calling us and like admit that we're real Like streamers and stuff. You don't need to call us like there's plenty of content On channels now But yeah, like it definitely like everything works out in the end Absolutely is everyone max level No Three people aren't max. Oh, I didn't mean to do that by a whole Yeah, like the worst part is over Wait what the heck Oopsies, I'm to kill the mailman Not to be confused with the Sandman that blows literal dust over your eyelashes or some shiz. I was ridiculous Never heard of the first time I've ever heard of that nonsense before I heard this song But like what? For goodness sake I Love how easy that stuff is Oh, excuse me, am I not your mentor? Oh, no, the PayPal got fixed and so you can support any of the girls like right now I think I need to update my link or something because people say it no work or something I don't know Oh, you're using the new info YouTube on soft as it's old European folklore, of course, it's nonsense. True a Literary tree Right, I don't really know what the plan is Okay, we'll finish the guild people's requests, but I have to admit I'm a bit lost on what next to do Get all the guild crests by everything and then I think we might be done maybe the feathers And And we'll revisit Mercy 30 minute Did I get the feather from this location I must go You did Cause a little chaos why not Christina, oh I forgot about Christina. Oh, right. Okay. Okay. Okay Oh I've completed all the renovations Wait, so what's my DNA? Must be high enough seriously 68 Is there anything I could do that's really easy No, no I don't want to do do you know be to take it Wait a minute did this one That was rubbish that one don't look I discovered no that was rubbish as well That was rubbish as well rubbish and maybe the missions I've never achieved that No, these like so aren't possible Well, maybe I need to do Wait the assassinations are only a oh The assassinations are like only a 41 Okay, okay, we'll do assassins that'll raise us that'll raise us really quickly like they're super easy super nice and consider it So we'll do that I Climbing up letters, don't mind me Y'all excited for my first day some ice cream I'm doing something Mildly special in it. I'm a bit concerned after what happened to me, but he will Apparently she was jumping up and doing on the bed like a monkey Yeah, were you there? Did you hear about this? Did you see this? What was my cute little sister doing on the bed hello? Mmm One little in me jumping on the bed and she jumped off and bumped her head How is your Oh Let's see the board to have unleashed their interrogate if they cannot find us we realize people do not let your targets call for reinforcements. Oh, I don't know what that means kill Wait, does that mean like don't get detected? She had to fall and land on her ear somehow. Yeah, I remember reading someone's review on it and I was like Now I want all my children to succeed but apparently Apparently we were spitting and licking it back up How do you plead to these accusations? I mean, how do you plead to such accusations? Actually Pin pals How do you plead to the accusations that you egged your little sister on? To do such devious acts I Guard is running for backup who who they're all highlighted Got kill bruise I don't know where that guy ran. I'm not really mad at it because I'm still gonna get DNA anyway, but Oh, there's scaffold in there I could grab them Not guilty I plead the fifth egged in me on all that's funny. What is she egging you guys on? Oh these accusations against my little sister. I will not stand for such things Right, okay, let's keep doing These She knew what she was doing my innocent little sister has no concept of What even a double meaning is You are looking at her through your your lusty eyes. How dare you? No, how dare you labeling on the innocent the innocent turn yet it because that's what the name of her So true She's always egging his own Right, I'm gonna send away those assassins that aren't ready to level out properly Thank you, I'll send you on a big big contract big big big big contract One two three four five of you She turned a guy into a tree like he was asking for okay She needs to level up. Okay. She needs to be experienced with what she's doing It's not hurtful Right, we seem to be about 42 percent use assassin recruits to assist in uh diversion Kill the merchant while remaining undetected He's peasy lemme squee Gotta get that xp somehow You know what you're right. Her latest Alt tweet probably is a misunderstanding exactly. You're just reading it wrong, okay Uh Can I like lock on to the guy Well, let me recall my recruit Is it bugged out? Oh Oh Wait, what was the mission use the session recruits to assist tonight diversion Oh, well That was easy peasy lemons wheezy. What's going on here? We are discussing how Pin pals have you so misunderstood They're looking at you with This They do I'm trying to tell them that you're innocent. Okay, and that they're not comprehending That the you jumping up and down on the bed during your ASMR stream is completely innocent And you were literally just singing that song Three little monkeys jumping in the bed one fell off and bumped its head first game the doctor or something That's not anything fun though. Sure All right, I don't get We'll do the feathers I'm not innocent. That's for e Who among us is innocent truly? No If I were making an among us reference that it means Lord there I was like, did you like that? Uh, and wait, I don't need to go off on it. Okay I Really suck out of this, you know, it has potential don't tell me otherwise. I won't accept such Right, you need to jump up here in order to get this flag I need them to come across more thieves to do the lure. I think I have like two more Thieves need to lure the guards away. I'm sad. I missed on these. I mean I don't good It means probably gonna do it And ASMR streaming in Just uh, maybe a little less Uh a little less, perhaps You know We can't escape V suck it could be another brand of ruler. It should be for the the innocent The innocent side where I just make them do like Girlfriend roleplay audios or like that kind of stuff. But like it's nothing. It doesn't like go any further, you know Safer work side that people have been asking for I did get a few emails um Management showed me them and people were like, uh, is it required to do that? and it was like Very sadly kind of the the whole point of the agency. Um, that's where the money is Oh, oh wait. No, there's not boarder people here anymore. I was getting nervous. So I was gonna get caught and I'm like, wait, man There's no boarder Oh Eye contact roleplay Teaching you eye contact proof. Oh, I don't know the best way to climb this. Maybe on the outside of the policy Give me that feather True love Ruffin Yeah, like so I did have a few variations of like Would there ever be a generation that didn't require that part and it's like What's the point? It's just a really agency at that point Um Where the height was that other feather? Oh, it's literally split perfectly Uh, where there is the Jump off point. Oh wait. We have a parachute. All right. We'll just use the parachute off the coliseum I Come pop off in real food where you can hear audible call. Oh, and me All right, we're just gonna do this Your assassins You There's a few uh group roleplay is actually seventh as well. I'm coming out Uh, I just can't any time to settle. I only want them to come out once the culling has stopped because literally it's like such a shame That it is still happening Even though like we're like getting into the studio. It's like, yeah, we've like got proper streams now. So I'm not really sure what the deal is Like the meme asmr's are literally i'm too scared to even upload them at this point because i'm like What's going on with asmr? I think there may have been a stealth policy update or it's about to be introduced publicly Feathers up here. Um This is a little sister you argued has an innocent mind. Yeah, I'm not arguing in what's innocent of Okay, right. We're gonna use the Yeah, there's definitely something going on at youtube headquarters when it comes to asmr because There's a lot of channels left and right getting yanked for content that previously was fine and they're my guess is that youtube don't want to publicly say it because Asmr is such a popular category on youtube like it's an insanely popular category And they don't want to come out and say it So they're just tackling it like silently basically So it's not arguing um I think I think the uproar if they publicly said like we're doing this would be so much because asmr I think they like said it's like one of the top four categories Sorry, like in the top 10 searches a variation of either like food eating or asmr medicines Like whatever you want to kind of really get into it um It's like such a high Watched category that if they publicly said like hey, we're drawing the line here now I do think there will be a post at some point But at the moment it's kind of stealthily being done. So the content is no longer Available. So when they do go publicly like hey, we've actually changed this people are like, oh, that's fine Because like no one's been uploading it anyway because you know, you've been deleting channels less than right and Handing out warnings willy-nilly. So Yeah That's my guess by the way. This is absolutely not factual. This is like just what my genuine like What I think is going on um YouTube is just like I see. Yeah, it's literally just my guess what's going on. It seems the most probable to me um So unfortunately, I think like you're looking content's just gonna have to be like Just straight up upload it to twitter or Put on patreon Yeah Solution and I know a lot of people are like, oh like just put it like not behind a paywall on patreon Unfortunately in order to link your patreon successfully Um everything must be behind the paywall First like even if it's a fine audio that is not wrong with it Um, it has to all be behind a paywall. It's bizarre It's bizarre the rules get very arbitrary in memoria Now you're wrong YouTube's drunk All right, let me see we've done the feathers. I have no idea how many We've done right we're getting close to doing the courtesans So Yeah, like we're so Uh enemy stations, right we're gonna do that now because I know how to do that. You have to replay a memory from the french one No Yes, this is the one Can you stream to x? I wouldn't stream on twitter No, you need money on it Like I hate to I hate to be that one. I know it sounds really sucky where it's like money money money, but it's like the Obviously the girl's name is ported and the thing with youtube boards is like Uh, you always like make money on youtube boards and like always look up and yeah Once inside your men can overpower the camps patrols, correct? Yes, I think it's fine saying like yes, we're not an agency for greed, but at the end of the day We need money around And the youtube boards is like a fantastic way or the youtube ads on like a small video for example Like this kind of stuff is like free to make content like it's free for me to stream right now, you know My troops will gather it from the dead and people underestimate the value of ad revenue the uh Advertise like the free The armor has to stay clean Right if you use your crossbow ball in this mission it accepts that last thing like oh, there's a horse right there Oh, there's another horse right there Yeah Businesses move can't do everything for you. Unfortunately, yes, the world is run on All right, I'm not going now because really peace forever to get to these guys there Um, we'll go this way instead. Yeah, this way's like so much better You basically for some reason if you snipe the guys in this one um They count towards that cortisone thing, but if you snipe in general it doesn't count Oh sugar. I'm sorry No, I didn't want to do that Actually, hold on hold on when the disarm and kill with his own weapon. There we go one of five I don't know 99% of all my problems come silver money.

If you don't there's also free stuff coming out a free video game coming out like, uh, yeah I think it probably helps without the greed out.

Oh, right. I'm hiding in here can't get me Does that count Did it count you seem to be still annoyed at me? I'm just gonna check that counted because if it does Uh, not the poking if that did count. I'm literally just gonna keep upsetting those guards over and over to do that again and again I think it should have counted those I did right time to keep bumping into them. I'm gonna kill this guard up here though because he's gonna keep ruining it Oh Yeah You smell so bad. No, you have to chase me Miss me miss me now you have to kiss me I was supposed to jump up Where's the bail hey, oh there is A six Oh I've got to get out of here And then we just open dive into this again Oh I'm not sure that counted he was like so close you guys should know No, I'm sorry, please excuse me.

It's supposed to go in the hair bill Oh See in the flip Can you hear that or am I going crazy? Am I going Did I hear that right? Yeah, okay. I'm good. I was like, um, are you all hearing nothing? Well, literally I wonder if it's leftover ambience from the party sequence with the banker Last one Okay I hear it again. Is there like people here or is it just SFX? More like SFX Yeah Yeah, there's not even coded people to be here. I must just be background ambience That's leftover from the party sequence with the bankers All right, let's get notoriety down a little bit because guards are getting really worse They're still asked it literally the party ended many a day ago. They just played operation Hmm crazy, that's crazy right I'm starting to get a bit delirious. Oh, I must switch the body though I don't know why that did so little I Watching all the girls straight a long watch starting to move off isn't it not too much noise like there's too much noise going on We're all blabbing away at once I'm not sure what to do. I'm kind of getting I'm not like stuck. I know we can do those things I'm just like, I don't know where the beam is for what we want to do Um I'm just like Do we call it and then the next thing come on I'm not gonna I like I'm like I'm saying to myself. I'm I'm gonna be annoyed at myself if I call it right now is one think I'm I think I'm in back yet Oh 19 seconds to come back Right, let me find a group of thieves to hire at least so I can get rid of that I can only focus it's hard to multitask that I'm watchable script right But mercy live if anyone would like to watch mercy modis Oh, I saw that. Okay, there are there are thieves somewhere on the verse up here No I see why they fear you I'm forcing Um I Think for simplicity will just teleport to the thieves guild in order to hire them. I struggle so much to find thieves I understand their own rooftops But they make it so freaking hard run wads Run wads of all six at once and let it just fry your brain Most of it's four, but only one audio Yeah, like I understand maybe for like a collab stream you like meet everyone but one person and then get to see everyone's POV Mmm, I have teleport to the wrong place. I was not paying attention. I apologize. Oh wait, there's somewhere I can buy hello Would you like to be purchased? It would be a shame not to do Christina though like we're actually so close Ah What's the percentage we need for Christina? Oh Why is your accent so cool sponding Scotland? and always be scottish It's very hard to unlearn that accent. Hmm. I even think it's possible Truly out there now Um, why was I here again? Oh to hire thieves and there's literally no thieves hanging out here I need to hire one group of thieves. Is this for real for real like for real for real? Uh, well, I need to find a beam that enemies pass over And it's kind of in these general area. I'm uh Unbelievably I'm at 69 percent. Um Like I don't know why Locate memory in world insufficient data to access locate memory in world go to memory start point to synchronize with animals Gotta go to work have fun at work If you could have any other accent, what would it be? Ah Copernacle might have a lot of percentage in it. That's missing. We'll do Copernacle. Um as for accent Can't imagine myself wearing her now. So honestly Like to pick one The Italian accent can be really nice Although the Japanese like but Japanese voices are like so nice and like pitched Um, which I really enjoy but I guess it's pitching no actual good boy Uh Her accent Honestly, I don't actually mind a Polish accent if you've ever Listen to a sweet Polish accent. It can actually be really soothing. Um Just a little a little hint of uh their words and that's pretty good. Apply the Scottish accent to any language Oh, you might apply to it It calvane It will sex I Was he believed Volgmae That's Scottish touch That's pretty awful Pretty rough pretty rough right. We'll try Copernacle, but if this doesn't like dramatically raise the DNA Think I'm gonna I think I'm perishing Unfortunately And it might be wiser to redirect into mercy and kind of have a break and Deal with uh, these a smart collage and see what I'm looking at because I think someone might be waiting on me to edit Scottish is the best accent as much as I was Who is this man? He comes from Russia. I hear studies at the body count, but his words are unlike any that issue from that place I don't buy it for Scottish accent's first Scottish is magical hearing German speaking with songs that weird You know, you have a good source accent when people can't even understand you Perhaps to disguise a myriad of contradictions I could use an excuse to go to bed. Yeah, I'm kind of like I think I'm actually lagging. I can't believe it. You're injured Me saying I'm an endurance streamer. I'm a liar. The master wants all the scholars silence by nightfall How long did we make it? And so am I Take no damage during the ambush right get the wee knife Two minutes Let's get to me nice No Yeah, that's what am I I'm gonna call in two of my assassins No, it was like way too early that you saw the way he was wiggling that knife up Whoa, why are you you know the guy that's like right in front of us maybe focus on like Oh Okay Okay, my assassins are sticking around which I'm quite happy about I don't want to call in the last batch of assassins just because If they kill them too fast, they actually might all be spawned and not help me at all, which is quite funny to think about I do wish citizens would stop running into the middle of the fight or near it. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Don't hurt me, please If I take no damage, I win Oh I'm scared. He's got such a long freaking pole. He's gonna hit me with it My assassin is trying to chase them but it's not happening I'm just hiding. I'm letting my assassins do it. Copernico is fine. His health bar is fine Oh, I've got fun. Oh, they caught me Uh, I don't want to get hit. I'm so close to doing no hit. Please. Please. Please. Please. Literally 13 seconds is all I ask Don't change up. Don't do anything else Four more seconds Okay, we did it We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it I think we came to do it. I'm still running away in case it counts. I think it counts So I'm just gonna keep running running and running in circles around the fountain Okay Yeah, that's right. I did that Right, I have terrible news Fake endurance streamer. Absolutely horrible news 100% poggers. Yay. You said 100% Wooo Now we may genuinely return to brotherhood again at a later date. Um But I'm actually quite satisfied. Literally, we did the campaign. We've done all the dlc stuff now You did that so hard that other people didn't Strolling it if you don't finish it just Means you need to do it. Yes. I actually wouldn't mind revisiting it at a later date I would like to play a bit more variety at this point. Um, I'm going to redirect into um Mercy so we can all enjoy her I I can't believe it. I'm not a real endurance streamer. I only lasted Nine hours this time. Gee willacrus. Oh, I'm kind of basic I can't believe it Oh Uh, please do consider giving a like and a subscribe. Uh, if you enjoyed youtube may have unscripted But don't worry. Uh, I'm going to redirect you an emergency An emergency Uh, redirect select stream. Oh, she's playing. Oh morey. Oh morey That's oh morey When mercy, please The tippy tippy day That's pretty good.

Uh, thank you So so much my lovely beeflings for watching Um, literally, I just I just checked it out. I'm like, I'm pretty sure the game has no copyright So it's a false copyright thing going on. But thank you so so much for hanging out. Uh, Yeah, maybe not 100 for the first time, but we'll give it a shot I think we'll come back and we'll feel refreshed at a later date Um, because that was a lot of jumping about. I think that's brought 20 hours Combined at this point. Um, so thank you so so much for hanging. Uh, tomorrow we're playing needy streamer overload I haven't played it So i'm not quite sure what to expect but is a shorter stream for me Um, so for those of you like the endurance side of things, I apologize, but my stamina is lacking tomorrow Um, but nevertheless is always fantastic. Thank you so so much My little reeflings or those who are watching and I will See you tomorrow and say hi to mersey.
