{"text": " I was trying to speedrun up in the stream started and the game. This game crashes so heckin' easily and it literally just crashed there. Praying it works. Praying it works. But good morning, good evening, and good afternoon. Oui, today my screen has gone black so hopefully I'm still streaming. Oh my god. Right, this game breaks. Oh, I think it's about to break again. No way. Oh, this game breaks so easily. Oh, don't break, don't break. Oh, my screen's black again. What? This game breaks so easily. I think this is like 2007 maybe? But goodness me. Good morning, good evening, good afternoon. Oui, we are playing yet again, surprise surprise, another childhood game. Wait, what? Oh, it's 2009. It says James Cameron's Avatar game 2009. So I played this game as a little sheriff and is there a girl that's white with black hair? Well, I'm not blonde. I'm not. Well, we just did that. Right, we're blonde with green eyes today. Yippee. So this game. Okay, now let's enter first name. Squiddles. Squiddly. I'm feeling a bit squiddly-diddly the day about. I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you? I had no idea they even released the game back then. Oh, this game is, I wrote. I'll shush until the campaign part, but they much to the campaign. Let me, it got slapped together. Let me tell you that much. I got slapped together. So I am a big enthusiast of Avatar. I absolutely enjoy the movies to the highest of heavens. Cut. Oh my God, I've not played this in years. Oh, look, it's us. Sigourney Weaver. Big Sigourney Weaver, where you been? We've missed you, Sigourney. Don't screw up. Got it. This has not stood up to the test of time, graphics-wise. My neck be bending. My armpit textures are warped. Oh, AC and Snow Berries. Hi. How was your puzzle game, AC? I watched you in the bath. Oh, this is really weird. I was in the bath and I was like, I'm sure AC should be on right now. And I opened up the game and you were like, this is a child's game. How can I do this? I thought I could do this because I think someone said, why did you pick this game first? Snow Berry Raid. Yeah, there was like a big whale with loads of ropes all over it. And I was like, I've never seen this game in my life. I'm too dumb. Did you not finish it? Was it like a finished game or was it like one of those ones where it's like, you just play for fun? Is Sheevee's fault? Sheevee, what did you do? She put the ropes in. Oh, that's very good. Oh, you finished it. Let's go. AC Smart. AC Smart. AC Smart. Hell's Gate. Kendra. Congrats if your name's Kendra. Okay, so we are playing an RDA soldier. Boots on the ground. We are a signal specialist, okay? We've just arrived at Hell's Gate, which is where the humans have landed on the Navi's home planet, basically. And the way that we humans survive is by sectioning off areas of Pandora, because Pandora is so aggressive and dangerous. Wendy, yes. The big blue ladies. Soon, soon. Hold on, hold on. You've never seen the movie before? Okay. How do you even summarize Avatar? Just watch yourself around, Dr. Monroe. He treats the avatars like his own personal guinea pigs. This is a very old game, and it is not a fair, like, assessment of what this game's about. However. However, however, however. Too long didn't read. Blue people good? Humans bad? Capitalism bad? Being nice to the environment? Good! That's it. That's all you have to know. That's all you have to know. You have completely caught up to the Avatar franchise, as we know right now. Bojinga, I think. Brian? Not me getting Brian back on the HUD. Thank you so much, Bojinga, for the 13, I appreciate it. I'm looking forward to this stream of this game that literally no one has played. I wish I could do a poll right now, but if I back out of this game, it crashes super easily, so basically, I don't even know if I'm going for a toilet break today. I looked it up and it said apparently the campaign mode is... 8 hours, but I don't believe it. Yes. We're at signal specialist. I didn't even know there was an avatar. Well, there's a new avatar game now, but we're playing the old- Let me take a sip of my honey tea today. Aloha. Did you guys watch Mercy's ASMR? Congrats to Mercy! Mojie's been the only member of Euler to not get her VOD taken down and leave a warning on her channel for sexual misconduct. Give it up for Mercy! Oh my God. Let's go, Mercy! I am so nervous for my ASMR stream because I had planned something a bit special for it. And... YouTube are dancing with all of us right now. Sorry, I'll get over the cutscenes first. We get to experience being in a navi body for the first time. If you haven't played, or don't know, you enter a booth which neural links you to an actual navi body. Don't look too much into it. It's pretty fantasy-based and all that jazz, but yeah. We are now in navi, we have access to a navi body, but we are still RDA. RDA's the bad guys. Boo! Boo! RDA! Navi! Yay! Navi! Yay! But RDA, boo! Go. Oh my God, that neck! That's killing me. She looks like a giraffe. Let me get over this bed real quick. So we have just been introduced to our avatar body. Navi body. RDA mission complete. So yes, this is a much older game. We're just... So we are about to... Anyway. She's pampering us. It looks good for its age. Honestly! So the newest avatar, I haven't had an... Oh! Brian! Bero, thank you for the 20. Would you guys neural link with me? Like, if you could go to bed, like, you see everything from APOV? Would that... Would I still be in control at that point? Or would you want to control me? Or would you want me to control you? Do you really need to ask? I don't know if you want to see my POV. You just, like, dine and be really disappointed that I don't have big boobs. Does the nicotine patch interfere with the process? Nah, you can leave it on. If anything, it makes it better when you're in. So this is the reason we are in Pandora, the world. You see those purple things underneath? Those are the resources we mine from this planet for capitalism back on Earth. It is crazy. Honestly, I get to pray. Hard to believe you're finally here. A-turn! Oop! They're purple. The resources are purple. A big butt better than Big Boa. We're here to get the blue oil. Did someone say oil? By the dawn, sparely. Did I tell you? In a voice chat, I sung that, but I only know the first two lines. And then freakin' Sheevie and Azura burst out into singing like the actual thing. And I was like, oh my god, this is really... I was getting serenaded by the dawn, sparely. I once prayed. I don't know the words at all. And I don't know why it's so hard. Like, why does it go high? Did you guys see my Twitter post about how much I got scammed on American sweets? Hello! So these are just basic transporters, but as you can see, this is the whole map of Pandora. We will unlock a few more locations soon, but there's not really much detail to it. We're currently at Hell's Gate. We are going to get flown to Blue Lagoon, but as you can see, this Earth is healthy. There's lots of blues and greens and all that. It's a nice, healthy Earth. Blue Lagoon. Open the game... Oh, that's just the information thing. I thought I was going to explain what Blue Lagoon is. Blue Lagoon is where a lot of the navi that are controlled by the RDA-side hangout and a few of the tribes are tolerant to our behaviors. Our human activities. So this is Tutorial Island, essentially. I thought this game was a fever dream. It's real! Hi, Stony. I remember playing this game as a kid. Congrats, you're one of the two people who have played this game that's watching right now. A very, very underground game. I'll tell you a very fun factoid about this game. So obviously, I was an Xbox kid. If you were able to obtain a copy of the special... Oh, I loved that little animation. This was probably before motion capture was even a thing because what the heck was that? Our encounter with Pandora's wildlife. These are Viperwills. They're terrifying. But their designs are so good. The animal designs are freaking amazing. I am needing to remember. That's to analyze. Okay, so we have freaking special abilities. For some reason, I can go and visit and shit. But you can level up and progress and make these abilities way stronger. But literally, it's pretty insane. The game's got loads of things going for it. So right now, we're just defending the perimeter from what way the game isn't too loud. I cannot adjust the volume without breaking it. We're just defending the perimeter from... Oh, I almost just shot our own guy there. Is it working? Okay, there we go. You do get XP. There is a level-up system in this game as well. I am so bad at aiming. Holy crap, I don't remember it being this hard as a child. Child Me is like so much better gamer when it comes to this stuff, honestly. Lollipop model confirmed we're doing some reward. Because, actually, why am I so much better at this game? I know they spawn over there a lot. Okay, objective complete. Love to see you play the game, but I will be very happy for every Navi I see die. For the RDA for humanity. You're joking. You picked the RDA? Who are you? Iron Reaper? You picked the freaking... Why would you prick? Oh, I literally just had a Freudian slip and called you a prick there. Why would you pick? This is not the Navi. Thank you for the 50. That's insane. Thank you for the 50. Grab a buggy and help him out. But you're wrong. RDA Supremacy. Reef Flames? We're here for nature and to be nice to wildlife. I'm literally a cuttlefish. Are you saying... Oh, is this Halo Controls? No, kind of. You can be attacked when you go out, but I will say one thing. The motion sickness. Merci. If you're lurking, do not watch this. This motion sickness on the vehicles is insane. Oh, we're doing hit and runs. We're doing hit and runs. Get wrecked. Oh, right. I missed that, but whatever. Oh, I can't remember much. There is going to be... This guy should... There is like aim assist in this game. So if you're bad at video games, please don't worry. If you ever think you might want to get this game a shot. You're a lifesaver. This game is giving commands for keyboard, but that's because... Wait, wait, wait. Butt bounce. Wait, where the heck did it go? I'm fighting. Oh, we're going to stick them out to go down. Oh, come on. You can tell Kale as well, which is really good in this game. This game is definitely for people who are not very... I would say if you're new to gaming, the game is very friendly to you. I say that as I literally am forgetting all the spawn locations of the enemies right now. These are Viper Wolves. Literally waiting until this game gets so beautiful. I wish... I don't know what the new avatar game is like genuinely about. I heard those growls. I heard that. I have gamer sense, okay? Oh, there's another one. Jeez. Whoa. My trigger just got stuck there. Are you squidding me right now? Glory to humanity and cuttlefish. Down with the navi. No, the navi are the good guys. Slice Saber? How dare you? Thank you for the tip. But the navi are the good guys. We're supposed to protect humanity, okay? Right, so we're currently saving the current signal thing or something. I don't know. Tutorial. We are doing tutorial, but I'm just spamming through it because I want to be navi. Just to be those dogs. Everyone's literally so beefed up in this game for no reason. Wait, you say navi's good guys. Protect humanity. The navi are the big blue ones. The big blue ones protect nature. We protect nature, okay? We... Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. You ready for this? We... You want to protect nature, little reform. You want to be a good boy for humanity. You want to recycle where physically possible. But we understand... Oh, wait. If the RDA are the bad guys, then why are their mechs so cool? Checkmate, tree huggers. Uh... The rea... Well, I'm gonna show you me absolutely wrecking and fricking decking those mechs. There's no way you guys are genuinely picking the human side. Doomsday, Dan, you're getting a spank, but thanks for the tip. And Beijing got again. No, you're wrong. You have to be nice. If I have to hit me... Tree huggers! If that makes me a tree hugger, then guess what? I'll proudly identify myself as a tree humper. Oh, I just got... Oh, I'm getting... I'm getting... I'm getting ganged up on. I'm getting ganged up on. Literally, the bark is peeling off from how hard I'm humping the wildlife right now, okay? Because... I'm not... I'm not... Oh, um... This is so much easier as a child. Hello, child, me. Can you just, like... I don't know, possess my body right now? Because why am I getting wrecked and decked? There's... Uh... Oh, for goodness sake, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm getting wrecked. I'm getting wrecked. What'd you get? Tim... What the heck? Tim Shuttle? Tim Shuttle? Your name is literally Cuttlefish. A little Shuttlefish. Glory to the hip, no toad. Protect the Navi and the sea star. See, Tim knows exactly what he's on about. Thank you, Tim. At least some of us have since... Right. You've got me there. You've got me a wee bit there. Hold on, hold on. But give him a chance. Give him a chance. Thank you, Otter Von Biscuit. Damn right you only sent for Cuttlefish. We the best out here. Wait, I just realized. I think I'm supposed to drive the car in here. Oh, I think I'm about to get attacked. Or maybe those guys are protecting me. I'm not sure. There we go. Run that, logist! Oh! See, you have level up system. Um, I have terrible news for you. If you want to do survival of the fittest, no weapons. Absolutely. Goodness. Is this...? Ah! Take this! Fart Bomb. Thank you very much. Sarge, IBW. What a unique... Thank you. Thank you very much for the tip. Sorry, Strony, but I'll never trust a species at... Look. All I'm seeing is give tentacles a chance. I might be getting a little tentacle addition here and there, you know? Am I going the wrong way? It looks like I'm going the wrong way on the map. I've not been here before. Oh my goodness, the camera angle. Look, the game aged all right. I'm not going to say it aged well. Wait, is there a little path back here? No, there's not. It's a lie. It's a lie. It's up here. Oh my goodness, this camera angle is horrific! I'm getting sick of myself. Let me in! Let me in! I'm human! What are you doing? Okay, I actually have to go backwards? Jeez. Thank you. Not Alessandro as well. Rules of nature, survival... Yeah, no. Oh my goodness! Wait! Oh my God! Lady driver moment! Please! Camera angle! Please! Jeez! Louise! Let me work here! My goodness! This is awful! Why is the camera... Oh my God! This is horrific! Are you kidding me right now? Oh, thank God. I don't get emotions like in the video games. Do you not expect the message to work this time long? Anyways, have fun, stroney and dreams. Brian's back! So when you tip, you can actually, like, act in here and you can hear it. Thank you again for the another tip, Alessandro! Eh, bitches. When you tip, you will never be read out. Oh my God, that camera angle is horrific. Please. Do not ever make me drive one of those again. Thank you. Oh, goodness me. Right. What is the heck is this? I've forgotten. Oh, it's a teleport pod. Okay. You can teleport between the different regions. So this is all the Blue Lagoon areas. Oh my God! This is awesome! Oh my God! That camera angle is horrific. Please. This is all the Blue Lagoon area. But as you can see, there's one, two, three, four, five. Why are the teleport points all at the bottom and only one at the top? Eh, I see how it is. Make a mirror walk everywhere. Okay, a little sip of my tea. Have you played it? Are you sure you've played this before? The accusations? I'm not beating the accusations. Right, I'm going to finish my tea before it gets too cold. Mmm. I'm delicious. I like the reverb effect on the verb. I mean, I don't want to ruin anything, but that's definitely may or may not happen in a certain ASMR stream. I like freaking changed the title of the ASMR stream because I don't know what is going on. Everyone's getting warnings left, right and center. Now don't get me wrong. Any jumping up and doing on the bed is quite humorous, okay? And I don't know, did she be actually doing anything that was that wrong? Now the only reason I will say Azura had received that warning was on the pure basis. Her voice is just like honey. Her voice is the sun embracing you after a few days of rain. Her voice is like that hug you have needed for years and you just let it all out and you feel like her. However, the other side of the coin for Azura's voice is it won't go down. It can't stay down. There's no such thing as a refractory period to her when you listen to her voice. Maybe you'll get 10 minutes a piece at max. You know what I'm saying? So I kind of get why she got a warning. I don't think she'd be got a warning because she was wise enough to private it. I don't know. I don't know if she did delete that. Did she do ear licking? Oh goodness me. Can't even do a ear licking. I don't know what's going on because people that show their face are still uploading all fine and dandy. So I think there might be a H-E-N update to the tie. Possibly pop stealth policy. Oh god, not the camera angle again. I'm currently driving with one hand so this is going to go absolutely awful. But look how big Pandora is. It's fantastic. One hand steering whilst I drink my tea. I'm like a real contractor honestly. Look, I'm just here to do the contract work. I'm not here to do anything special. I get paid on the day. Okay, driving isn't actually that bad right? Let's speed up. Let's go. Let's see if two handed. I'm even worse probably. Oh, I'm hitting the land. I'm doing the Titanic. Titanic momentum. I am played this game when I was young and when I tell people about it, they never believe it's real. Also for the Navi, support nature. Yes, thank you. Thank you for the tip, Kitsune. Gaming today. Literally, I don't think I've really met anyone that's heard about this hecking game. But I'm glad that a few of you actually have played it. Okay, I'm just unlocking teleport stations when I do that. Hi, hi everyone joining. We're playing Avatar. James Cameron's Avatar. Some people thought it was Avatar, the last airbender related. No, no, no, no, no. Not at all. Although, I think Amy might be doing a watch along that if you're into watch longs. Please do think about supporting your local neighborhood little sister because she may be doing a watch along that a little bit. I'm going to take a little sipping tune of my cola. I need to hydrate. Now I get to ramble about all the work I did yesterday. Okay, so the update is... Are you squidding me right now? Unless... Brian! Gaming in one hand while she stronts the cuddles in the other. It's more difficult than you think. Not that I'd know. Honestly, thank you for the tip. Tharja. Tharja, I feel like that's not how you're supposed to pronounce it. Are you Swedish and it's Tharja? Tharja? A little bit of a Swedish moment. Look, it's that guy we saved in that cave only a few minutes ago. What kind of cola? Just cola cola. Is it called Coke Zero when it's got the no sugar? I finally went no sugar on the cola. Aspartame. I can finally tolerate aspartame. It is that thing that is in the drinks to make it sugar-free. But I was like, I don't mind having a big badonk-a-donk, but I don't want it to get too big. So I'm now drinking aspartame, which apparently gives rats cancer. So it's not looking good for us mammals. But hey, oh, you got to die something. And, you know, I'm not going out without enjoying myself. That's all I'm saying on that much. Right. There are vapor wheels here, so please excuse the combat. Boom. Now you can just came to do this, but it does bring you out of fricking invisibility. Get in the boat, get in the boat, drive away, drive away. Yeah, see, they get scared of my little fart bomb. Actually, I think it's called a supersonic wave and they don't like the noise, which makes sense. You know, nature doesn't like loud noises. Can relate on a physiological... Physiological? No, not physiological. Oh, now you can just skip quite a bit of combat if you're cheeky, but only if you're smart enough to do the things in the correct timing. I'm going to heal up. You can heal up naturally and it just means gentle for time. As I said, this game is super forgiving to new gamers. If you are into kind of that fantasy element, then... Am I to walk from here? I can't walk from here. Nature doesn't like loud noises. Literally the loudest of nature. The sea bomb or a big badonka? Those are the two choices. I don't want to... I don't mind getting too big. No, sorry, I do mind getting too big. You know, you got to keep that pear shape on. You know, like when I do that hand cam stream, everyone's going to know the real size of my chest. Yes, I will teach you all the strats of this game. For those who are wondering, is this an adjourned stream? This is roughly a seven hour stream. So do feel free to stream yourself for the full seven hours. If not, then the seven hour stream. Roughly. I believe we will actually successfully catch Mercy for a redirect if my humble Mercy is streaming today, which I believe she is. As always, if any of my gen mates come online, please remind me and I will tell those who would much prefer to watch a game that isn't archaic or whatever they're doing on stream. We're supposed to for seven hours. I feel like that would hurt. But anyway, because I cannot tell you how strange it was to go offline after two hours, it literally felt like, what do we do now? Oh, now we play the game. Because I was like, wait, I have so much time and yeah. So I've got three more ASMR collabs on the way. I did a little bit of socializing. We are now Navi. We're about to do some Navi questlines. But please remember, we are RDA Navi. To use teleportations, we use the tree of vision. It's very important to get those because my goodness, it makes travel so much easier. Look how tall we are and the camera angle has changed and is much more favorable. I prefer when video games have a really pooled out third perspective camera. If the camera is two centimeters away from my face, I do not like it. I find it very hard to look at. I don't know if that's because I need glasses and I still haven't trained myself to wear glasses. Very bad girl, bad girl, very naughty. But I think that my preference in video games is a zoom out angle. It might be related to that because, yeah. But hey, does anyone know the full name of the game and it's on Steam? I don't even know if it's on Steam. It is called James Cameron's Avatar. Okay, the Navi can go through these doors. Nope, only when they're green. Okay, sure, sure. We are about to encounter the wildlife. They will still attack us even if we are Navi and RDA does not matter. Where the heck am I going? I'm going the wrong way. That's why I'm getting turned around. Now, again, we do have superpowers. We have sprint. We have invincibility. We have health and we have ground smash, which is very good. In order to get healing, if you look on when that health bar comes up again, you'll notice the number zero at the bottom left on the right side of the health bar that appears bottom left. The more cell samples we pick up, the more second chances we have. Now, it's very common to run out of health in this game. It's just the thing that happens. It's not a big deal. Again, the game's very forgiving. You can literally do this all the way through the game and anything can hardly hit you. But the later sections of the game, I don't know if there weren't many playtesters because it was very rough in the later sections of the game. I have to admit, it's getting pretty rough. We are going to unlock this Tree of Vision, so now we can teleport to this region when we come back to 100% the region. You must be rider. Let's get you up to speed. How many games do you have lined up? My apologies. Do you mean to play in general? If you mean games overall, like daily streaming games for a year? Question mark. Next week in endurance is Skyrim. It's another childhood game of mine. I used to do 100% achievements in Skyrim every year because I really appreciate the game and its vanilla form. I do apologize if you like mods, but I don't know what to say. Now we're among friends. We aren't friends, so you need to learn quick. We aren't friends? Figure that out. Would you guys, you know, would you guys really view? What? 100? You are one cool gal. Fell in love when you started playing all my favorite games. Also humans number one baby. No! I used to tactical strike every navi, every chance I got. Anonymous! No! Bad boy! Bad boy! Thank you for the 100. That's a lot of money though. Please make sure you're looking after yourself and treating yourself. 100 is a lot. Jesus. Bad and on. Bad boy. Come get spankens right now. Bad. Let me take a sipping tin. Are you squiddin' me right now? Goodness me. Can't believe the reflings are betraying mama like this. SMH. Exactly, Nero. Don't worry though, strongy. I'll never betray nature. Must protect the navi. Exactly, we stand nature in this house. We will look after nature. As you see me, you can literally hear me dancing about in my chair right now. So we are, what the heck is that zone? And why is it so big? Oh, we're plant sampling. Okay, this is tutorial section. When I explained, thank you for the tip again, Nero. Anonymous, my goodness, that was a lot of money. Play, is something attacking me? No. When you pick up cell samples, there's that little white bar on the left side. I didn't, and you thought there was enemies because I was like, why am I getting, playing as an avatar? As an avatar, pondora's flora, which means flowers, and fauna means animals. Yes. As less aggressive towards you, therefore, killing and offensive creatures and plants will not yield experience points. All the reeflings siding with humans want to be the guy from strongy's lore video. Oh, I'm so bad. Hope a siren doesn't drown me in the ocean. Thank you. Thank you, Anonymous, for the tip. Oh, you guys don't want me to, you know, take you down in the waters with me, that's not. Honestly, my lore is so evil. I promise, I don't want to, I don't want to hurt. What? Why do I suck so bad at this? Wait, what was that? No way, they have a slow motion kill cam. I did not recall that whatsoever. That's amazing. Don't threaten us with a good time. That sounds very yandere-esque. But yeah, in terms of evilness in lore, why? What was that? I heard that. I can hear it. I actually got scared there. I heard it, but I couldn't turn the analog stick in time. So if I am human- Why are there so many? Oh no, I heard the plant. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Mr. Plant. I'm actually getting a bit scared. Why is there so many? Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Pause. Pause, I hear more. Oh my god, they're literally biting my ankles. They're biting my ankles. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop. Okay, relax. Relax or just collect and sell samples in this area. I think I've hurt every... All the enemies are gone. Yeah, so these type animals don't attack. They can't bite my ankles, man. If you are human and come across this plant, it is very poisonous. It spits a bale at you, which is actually really cool. But the design elements that went into this game is just beautiful. But yeah, the development, you can actually... Yeah, you can scan... Who goes there? You can scan stuff and add it to a database and that. I've never 100% of that. Oh no, we can't because I would have to play the RDA side. But I'm not playing the bad boy side. But yeah, if you're into 100% completion, absolutely you can do that kind of thing. But it is a very beautiful game. I am very much into alternative... I saw that, it popped up my little thingies. I knew it. We can do this and just kind of try and bypass all the enemies on the way. Enemies. Did you watch the second movie? I absolutely did. I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie with Jake Sully. Absolutely. I love your names, Jake, by the way. Absolutely fantastic movies. Completely captured me in that kind of fantasy, different world, especially the night time scenes when everything is lighting up. Speaking of lighting up, hold on. Reactive model, you ready? Reactive model, do you want this? Or do you want my normal model? I can turn over in it. The bioluminescence scenes. Yes, bioluminescence scenes. Pushing boots to destroyed Avatar 2 in the box office. Nah. Woo, our first meet with a navi. Like an actual navi, not an RDA navi. Are you ready? Hello, Tanjala. Oh, I'm stuck on this corpse of a theme of Ober. Hello. Hello, I'm on a kayak. This is good. Oh, Renee Harper is a corny weaver. She's been poused with a navi. She overslept them. Tanjala wants you to kill the sick, strong beasts. Anyone else identify themselves as a strong beast? That's ridiculous. We're really starting to dig hard for these words. Avatar 2 had no story at all. A perfect how not to make a sequel. I disagree. Brian! Exactly! Exactly, Grimble. Thank you for the tip. We do, Brian. I have not seen fair and golly. Bajinga! Thank you for the tip. What's fair and golly? Have you guys seen fair and golly? Are you doing what you eat? You like Sigourney Weaver a lot. So, Sigourney Weaver, the first thing I've seen her in. Oh, we're just to destroy these, by the way. Sigourney Weaver Avatar was the first thing I ever saw her in. And I just adored her. I adored her character. Her voice is so lovely as well. It's such a... If you ever struggle at this point, just jump up on this rock right here. They can't... Oh! They can't hurt you if you go on the rock. They can't do a thing. If you're on the floor, these guys will knock you over and take a big chunk of your health. Is something else attacking me? No. But we're good to go. Robin Williams plays a bat in this. Fair and golly is basically the Barbie Pixie... The Barbie Pixie movie in 2D, but human... What? And humans are bad guys. It was a good movie. The direct to VHS sequel was... Okay. Tim Curry sings. Oh my god, Rocky Horror Picture Show. You put your hands on your leg. No, that's not right. You put your hands on your hips. That's it. I find a dance inside. We should watch that. My mum really likes that movie. So I've watched it from a young age. Yeah, it's absolutely bizarre to conceptualise what on earth happens in that movie at a young age. But hey ho! That's just life. That's just how it is. We're going to... Oh! I heard. Butta dog. Dog with a butta. I heard that. And mama. Get your butt to the top of that. I want that. What are you doing here? I'm so tainy. Oh no, I'm so big. POV, you're Azura? You're talking to Azura right now. This is the hate difference between you and Azura. What's going on? I'm shutting down the knob. It's Emmy and Azura. Oh, we Emmy. A giant woman. No, don't lie. Don't lie right now. And say to me, I didn't cook with making Azura a giantess. I will not take... Right, if that's not going to hurt me, I'm actually just going to leg it. I'm legging it, boys. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. Oh! Wah! Wah! Right, we're just going to stealth through this section. There's a lot of dire wolves. Eh, viper wolves. However, we're no interested in fighting. So, we're just going to zoom past because this entire section is optional, honestly. We're just going to zoom ahead again. Cooked. You did indeed cook. No, I knew I wanted some sort of thick Vtuber model. I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. There's really not that much variety for the thick and for the chocolate. So, it was just absolutely no questions asked. Probably going to do the same in Gen 2 where, you know, something's going to be lovely in Gen 2. Brian! Didn't expect Sigourney Weaver to side with the Navi considering her history with aliens. Is she the main... Is she the main alien? Because I remember reading a really... Oh, we're on a horse, by the way. Check it out. Look at my horse. My horse is amazing. Oh my God, its face is all... That's a really unfortunate face. Everything else, yeah, that's all right. Look, I'm riding a pony. I'm such a girl. Oh my God, this is the girls game as well. Oh, no. Oh, there's actually really... This is really boring, but when we come back to this section later, an enemy always spawns on this rock and he's infinite stuck and you can never, like, hurt him. Okay. It's time. We need to make a decision. Are we Navi? Thank you very much, Iron Reaper, for the tip. I think I actually forgot to say that, but thank you for the tip. Are you squiddin' me right now? Nero! Speaking of, how tall is Stacy Milketon? Thank you, Nero, for the tip. So we are a signal specialist and we've set those signals up, but we were told that they weren't gonna... It wasn't gonna be used for destroying Navi. Nori, nori. Ah! So we're learning we just destroyed all the Navi's home. It's work. Are we the baddies? Raider? Hardly even nor. Oh wait, sorry, sorry, hold on, do that again. Raider? Hardly even nor. Come on, how goofy is that? I wanted to see... Raider, are you ready? Are you ready? We're gonna do it again. Okay, hold on, let's do this bit and then when we're mucking about I'll do it again, okay? That was amazing. Right, so this is where you decide. Do you want to be Navi or do you want to be RDA? If I shoot him, we become RDA. If I shoot him, we become Navi and defend this Pandora in the name of being a foreigner. We need to kill it. We guys first go. Destroy him. Just... Oh, I'm low health. Oh my God, I'm farting about too much. Oh, why is he so strong? Right, go. Wait, I'm actually gonna get... I think I'm actually gonna perish. He's like actually wrecking and decking me. What's going on? Why is his health not going down? Why is my aim bought so bad? Right, hold on, hold on. Hold on, let me aim bought. He healed up! No, no! Only I'm allowed to heal up. The enemies shouldn't be allowed to heal up. It should be illegal in video games. Development team, you have failed. It should be... Why is he only shooting me as well? Can you like shoot that other guy? Right, hold on. Let me readjust this aim bought. No, he healed up! Only I'm supposed to be healed up! Right, that's it. Grim pound! It didn't even work. Did it work? I don't know. I'm gonna be honest. This is a few too many bullets are going through you. I spoke too many bullets. Sudden darts. He survived all those bullets. I gotta go now. Grab your dire horse. Dire horse? Banshee! Ik-nee-ma-ya. Ik-nu-ee-ma-ya. No idea who I'm supposed to see. Ik-nee-ma-ya. Ik-nee-ma-ya. Sounds like I'm trying to say something in the dark. The RDA doesn't do anything piecemeal. Ik-kawanyo? It's not Ik-kawanyu. Got anything better than bows and arrows? They defend their homeland. Those are the only weapons they need. Great. Good choice, Ryder. Ik-nee-ma-ya. That's what I'm saying now. Couldn't humans kill the main guys? Human body in the machines? Yes. That's very true. But it was arranged that the... Look out! Oh, look out! We stunning on them. Look at this. Got a little outfit of the day moment check. Come on. Look at my jewel-wield blades. Come on. That's so cool. Oh, how did I hit? That's so cool. Come on. That's so cool. I'm sorry, but look how cool that... Oh, my God! That's terrifying. Imagine that running at you. Oh, I just cracked myself right there. Your avatar isn't blonde because blonde doesn't exist in Navi. I don't think... Maybe it does. I don't know. I don't think I've recall seen a blonde Navi. Oh, no. I do in the different regions of... But we are jungle Navi. This is jungle Navi. There's different types of Navi. Or jungle Navi. Sadly, not closer to your level plus. We need to win his approval. Oh, my God. She's so real for that. That's... Okay, we need to try and get the approval of this guy. Why? I've already forgotten the plot, but we're going to do it anyway. But basically, we are full Navi right now, and I'm going to tell you something. Okay, this really is a girls game, because every time we go to the next location, we unlock new outfits as we level up, and I get to like play a little wardrobe simulator. Such a girls game. That's such a girls game. Yeah, he ain't happy at all to see me in. Oh, I need to be able to raid a Banshee or an Ikran. That's what they're called. Oh, my God. Blanky. Hold on. I need to get what's the link, because I'm hurting my legs against the table. Ooh. Did I just skip dialogue down that? Oopsie daisy. New outfits. Let's go to the next area. Oh, my God. Fashion Simulator. We played Landlord Simulator on Brotherhood. Now we're playing Fashion Simulator on Avatar. Right. We are about to learn a motherfucking bow and arrow. Oh, did not mean to do that one. Let's try that again. Pardon me. Excuse me. That was very daft. I just absolutely threw myself off the mat there. How does zooming on the bow and arrow again? Not that one. Oh, wow. It's just hold and release. Okay. Who would have thought? Who would have thought? It's just holding release. The Navi's drip is indeed real true. This game seems surprisingly competent, actually. I was doubting. I get game. It is. Honestly, I get game. Wait. What am I doing? Oh, we're doing our first human kill. Oh. Yeah. The aim is very forgiving. If you want an easy game. Definitely recommend this game. The bow and arrow is very satisfactory. But I'll tell you one thing though. Oh, look at this camera. Look how terrible this camera like pings off of different. Like you can see the markers of where they put the tracking to do that. Like it's not smooth. Like. Oh my God. Who goes there? Identify yourself. I need to jump. First human after killing two low level. So actually true. I just recalled that. Really, really willy nilly killing over here. Any willy killers? No, don't. This is another armor we kind of get to unlock about later on. It's not quite the same. But here we speak to bar a word for it. I hear you betrayed your own kind to be here. Yeah. How soon will you betray us? It will take more than this offering. The scale of the arrows are massive they are. Like Navi are so big. So there wasn't a big tree in the game? Oh, we aren't at the end of the game yet. You just hold on to that thought. You're a couple of missions ahead. But I like doing this. They don't disconnect us for treason, honestly. She wants the braid tails? What happens if we braid tails with each other? Is that like a marriage proposal? Is that Navi? We braid each other's? He will not show it. Oh, that's his wife? Come, we must destroy Sky Tower. We find these. How will you say? Take care. Will you help us? These boxes are explosives. TNT? Yes. We have word for this. Kangangang. Kangangang. Oh, that's so satisfying to say. Kangangang. Is that a TNT? Kangangang. I messed with that. You can flip into the waterfall to get down here a bit faster than going all the way around the map. I will heal. I shouldn't have done that. I thought you could slip down without too much. Oh, you have 50 bow. And every time you get a sample, you replenish your bow and arrow ammunition. So all those green is more bows. Genghis Khan? Okay. You're done. Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through. You guys can't aim. Oh, I can't aim either. It's fine. Okay. I think because my keyboard is registering. Hello? Hello? Okay. I think because my keyboard is registering, the aim assist isn't being as active as it is normally on Xbox. Because I could have sworn I didn't even have to aim. Conta. Jeez. They just disappear. Okay. We seem to get either 5 or 10 arrows from samples, which is pretty good. I would say that's pretty good. Kangangang. Hans was simulator, actually. I prefer the born hours myself, but I'll tell you something that's really sad about this game. As we level up, our equipment also becomes stronger in nature. Okay. However, if you did not purchase the special edition, which they made about 1000 copies of for some unknown reason, if they didn't do the special, if you didn't buy it, your bow does not one-shot the enemies as you level up. It is complete nonsense. They made only so few copies. I was like, oh, do you see how that flower attack is attacking them and they're taking poison damage? So unfortunately, our bow and arrow, I can't even see them through the... Bra, why are you missing? Bra. You do heal over time naturally when there's no fight, so you don't always have to spam heals. What's this? What's that? Ammo. I thought my ammo... Whoa! Wait, what do I have access to? So dual wields, one big ass swing, a gun and a bow, right? I normally just stick the bow. Very good. Very good, very nice. But overall, game is very forgiving. If you're ever interested, we should do that, but that comes later. We'll always come... Oh! The acran just said bye to that. I'm pretty sure they would have got mowed over, but like, as long as they're happy, I'm happy. So right now, we're picking up our boom boom Genghis Khan. Do you mind? Where did you come from? You weren't even there. You're such a liar. You're lying. Where are they? I hear them. Snipe, and not snipe. I am low health. That's okay. We're gonna heal up like that. She can heal up. And then we're just gonna move. Oh, we're not gonna move on to the next section. We're gonna go invisible. Oh, no, we're not. Can you still... I don't know if you saw that. Those flies were attacking him. Like literally, Pandora is so nice to you when you're napping. I love it. Oh, I hear them. Oh, so these are bombs that fly into you. I'm pretty sure I heard a guy's voice though. I'm like 99% sure. I heard a guy saying they're out there, but I didn't see it. I love the way you say jaw wield. Oh, no. Wait, does it say differently? Jew... Jewel wield? Jewel weel. Jewel. Pandora thinks humans are an infection. They are. They're terrible. When you play RDF, it's just as truly similar. Oh, that's hilarious, honestly. It's such a good game. Such a good game. I love this game so much. The only complaint I have about this game, it was made when games like to do... Why? It's like I have to aim a little to the right. I do. I've aimed a little to the right. We can go down or up. My memory says up, question mark. Jewel wield. Well, my memory was correct. Oh! He got a little ambitious for trying to hurt me there. Where is this? It's up there? Oh, it might be up there. Whoa, I just spotted you in the corner of my eye. Yeah, these are literally... You know, I don't know what they're called. Those bombs that are for submarines under the water. I don't know what their name is, but that's what those are, but in the air. Oh, I missed. Yeah, the aimball in this game, working! Aimball, please! Wait, he didn't perish? Jeez. It looks like they're... Oh, we need to shoot that. Hold on. Wait, do we actually? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't remember this part of the game, geez. What's the rocks for? Am I to destroy these? No way. Yeah, so I'm using bullets too. Un-ball, un-mort. More like, sent-ball, un-mort. Why? The aim assist is not like me. I'm not actually going to claim that tree of nature. That's what... The travel point, because... Holy crap. Oh, no, I don't have unlimited ammo! Bruh! I thought I had unlimited ammo! Jeez. What did that do as a child that made... It really must just be the aim assist. Because I think if you all one-shot everything, there's like no way this stuff is even hurting me half as much. Oh, I missed. I shot, and I missed again. And then I shot, and then I missed again. And again. I don't know how to unshoot. I can't pick up ammo from that. I can only pick up ammo shells. Honestly! Let's see if we can get away with this. Because we just need to pick up the package and then go. Oh, wow. Okay, cutscene time. Cutscene time! Whoa! Gang, gang, gang! Gang is gone! Okay, let's get the heck out of here, I don't want to get hurt anymore than we need to. I heard that belief and I was going to go for it. I think we're about to get on her screen. Long story short, I missed. Yeah, I missed again. And then I shot. And then I shot. And then I missed again. Thumb arrived. Alright. Okay, we're about to climb. Climb, climb, climb, climb! Yeah, I think the campaign mode is roughly 7 hours. We could probably come back in 100% the sectors. And we can also play this mini-conquest game, which actually I really enjoyed as a kid. But you have to do it at the end of the game for like 100% success rate. There are Viper Wolves ahead, but we're just going to be cheeky and do this. And then we completely negate even having to fight a lot of them. Unfortunately, invisibility... No, invincibility is when they can't hurt you. Invisibility is when they can't sneeze. It doesn't last forever, but as we level up... Like... Oh, actually we're really close to leveling up. I don't know if I should... I don't want to hurt the wolves. I don't want to hurt the wolves, but I'll kill the humans, no problem. Yeah, no, that's fine. That's fine. Yeah, that thing, that thing. It's friendly fire on. No, you cannot hurt other navi now that you're a navi side. I assume it's the same if you pick RDA. Oh, good snipe. Oh, good snipe. Okay, if I can take my time to properly aim. No, I think I was out of range. There is a range to your attacks. Like, you can't... Oh, well, I just suck. There we go. There is a range distance to your attacks. I cannot for the life of the human. Am I to go this way? Am I to go this way? No, classic dead end. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Mom, get the camera. Play of the game, honestly. Did you guys see that Marvel Superhero, like 5v5? I hear a bomb. I see a bomb. Um, um, um, um, um, um, I really don't want the bomb to get me. Oh, I'm already out of in this. And the bomb is chasing me. Okay, we're doing it. We're just going for it. We're committing. Did anyone play it? Marvel rivals. Yeah. It looks so good. Everyone was, like, dogging on it, but I'm like, oh, I actually really enjoyed the look of it. Uh, I'm installing the game now just to kill the Navi. You know what? You're done. You're done. I'm definitely going to play Marvel Overwatch when it comes out. Yeah, and then wasn't there not another company that came out with another Overwatch-style game? I think it was Marvel. It was a company that came out with another Overwatch-style game. I think development teams literally watched, like, the mess up in real time. I don't know if that thing's still chasing me, but, um, there is another one. Yeah, like Scarlet Witch with Moira and all that. Yeah. I used to play a lot of Overwatch. I actually really enjoyed the game, but I just don't play it anymore. Like, I don't find it rewarding, or, which is such a shame, because I've poured a lot of hours into that game. Um, but I would absolutely love if we could do Marvel rivals together as, like, a stream snag game. Like, um, I don't know how the accounts work, but I'm, like, 99% sure I can make a dummy account, and then, like, add users' friends, and then make note of who's, like, played, and then just rotate between, like, kind of what we... Oh, here we go. Level up. What did I unlock? Let's see. Uh, Bam Knee Pack. We have a club weapon with frickin' spears on it, or another type of RDA gun. Oh. And a shot. And a missed. Oh, and a missed again. I can hear an enemy. I don't see him. Oh, there he is. That wasn't him that said that. Oh well. Whatever. Whatever. Um... Blizzard is horrible with their IPs yet. Time to go back to Team Fortress 2. Honestly? But I'm sh... I could have sworn I saw another development team come out with something that was similar out to the format as well. So I think, literally, everyone watched, uh, Overwatch 2 come out, and as soon as Jeff Kaplan left the development team, I think everyone behind the scenes knew what on Earth was up and knew it was, like, essentially gonna flop due to the, uh, change in... gameplay. But when Marvel Rivals does come out, uh, because I think it's in beta right now, or... I may be wrong, um, I'm happy to make a dummy account. We'll make it a multiplayer game, and, uh, we'll just kinda... uh, add in, uh, I think it's 5v5, so it means four reeflings of myself can play at the same time against, uh, just randomers. Um, we'll, like, play actual public match games, uh, unless you guys really wanted to go against each other. I'm not sure having me and your team will be a good idea though, cause I'm not very strong at the game cause I've yet to even play it. Um... But if that's something you guys are down for, I'm heking down for it as well, uh, obviously, uh, we'll remove everyone at the end of the gaming session and restart fresh. As I said, it'll be pow! I saw that, I don't know if I'm gonna get ahaaa! Right, I'm backing off, I'm backing off. I don't think down yet. No. That part comes later on. I didn't know. I'm gonna pick this up. Team Landers, Johnny. Oh, should I tell everyone what to do? Protect me, heal me, heal me. I used to play Zarya, which is an offensive tank. Over what? Oh my god, they're so beautiful. The music's changed. Oh, they're so beautiful. The ikran. Look at them all judging me. Oh, that's okay. You can judge me. Look at them. They're so pretty. Hello. Please don't attack me. They're so beautiful. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Please understand. This game's a little old, which is why they're all the same color. Please forgive. Please forgive. But I assume the new avatar is like really beautiful. And my ikran literally almost made me perish and then said, yeah, all right, I'll pick you up. I got pranked by it. I literally done a little pranky on me. A little pranky-wanky. Oh. No. No. It's not a good look, honestly. I mean, you would really choose match over Mecha over the big birdie. Exactly. Why would you pick? Oh, look at us. We're so lying. There's no an RDA that will leave alive because the resource destroying the Pandora. Oh, I love fly. Oh, ow, ow. Sorry, your wing, your wing. My apologies. Sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your wing, little Banshee, but thank you for being so forgiving. But we're just flying through the map now. Banshees have an insane HP. We will be shot at as we go around. I don't know if you read that really quickly. It said lifting the fog 50%. Don't worry. Oh, we really need to get some height. Oh, I'm going to do a little cheeky 360 to get that height there. We are about to reach the ceiling in this game. Oh, all right. Climb. Climb. Jeez, this map has a lot of verticality. Definitely did not remember that. But yes, there was a sector challenge that says lifting the fog. There's a few sector challenges. Depending on how long the campaign takes, we might actually just 100% all the sections. Oh, excuse me, game. I know for a fact I flew over that. Would you like to register me flying through this? No. Oh, okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Women moment. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Lady drive. Okay, there we go. There we go. You got it in the end. I'm sure this is like really beautiful cinematic if you do. Oh, we got it. Okay, but we're hitting that rock. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Look, the camera angle isn't, it's not that easy to freaking dive, dive. All right, then go up, go up, go up. Hey, there we go. But yes, Banshee are a really good way to get around these maps. Whoa, easy, easy, easy. And we are back to the start where we started. Look at us going. Isn't that beautiful? Okay, I am going to say before we start this next quest, there is a voice line that repeats consistently through this mission. I will try to get through it as fast as possible. It is so annoying. It is so annoying. Genuinely so annoying, horrifically annoying. Unless this isn't the mission. Don't say that. Maybe this isn't the mission I thought it was. And where are the turkeys? Audio bugs are the worst. Is that Ubisoft game? It has to be. The, the animals slowly regretting letting you drive them, honestly. Okay, no, it's after this mission. They're really annoying when pops up. What did we unlock? A crossbow and some sort of ability. Hold on. How do I open that? Skills? Kinetic dash, Ewa's breath, Titan bash I don't really use. We could maybe replace it with, Calls of Hyperwolf to your side. It'll fight for you for a short time. That's pretty cool. Honestly, bees, death by bees. Right, here we go. What the heck am I supposed to do? I completely forgot. Right, we're going to raid or a crane. Can I go on you? Okay, look. Oh, he's going forward. I never really, Hey, Ostrone, I'm off to work. But if the stream ends up being a bit longer, then I should be back in time. See you after work. Hope to catch you there. Thank you, tiny spiny. I appreciate the tip. And yes, um, I did look it up. I said the game takes around seven hours to complete. If we come back and do section stuff that wait, that where am I? That land? I think I'll land up here. Yeah. Okay. It looks like I'm definitely to land to keep that crane safe up here. You stay there, buddy. You be nice and safe. But yes, have a good day at work. Thanks for hanging. I appreciate it. And I appreciate the tip too. I'm not to say donations because it's not a donation. It's a tip. Actually, I don't know if I'm supposed to update the girls as things to be like, you know how you're supposed to put like a disclaimer on like the freaking thing in case someone does a charge back. Right. I'm 99% sure these guys just keep respawning. So I'm actually not to fuss. Do you mind? Thank you. I'm not to fuss for completely clearing up the section. Oh, it's a bomb. It's a bomb. Okay, there we go. Let's go up. Is that about to like blow up right next to me? Oh, I didn't. Oh, no, we didn't kill guys don't look at explosions. You know the drill. Okay. You know the drill. Kill guys don't look at explosion. Well, you mean stream, elements is intact. I like some if someone does like a thing, a disclaimer for charge right would be I'll probably edit the motor then or when I get off. I don't know. I get tired. I get tired after screaming. Okay. Oh, I have a fantastic update for scripts. Oh my goodness. So the script manager now has access and is taking over and look. So everyone has a four part series coming out like a story that kind of progresses. Sheeby's four part series is currently being written right now. I'm not trying to say anything, but good luck trying to hold it together when she performs that script. Because wow, I was blown away. I'm like, there's definitely like something to be said about like a guy writing a script versus like what I could write because I just like I like challenging myself and in general like I know what overall you'd like us to say type thing. But I have to admit I was like, oh my god, there's not going to be any anything left in the sack after that one. And that was part one I read. I didn't even read the finalized series of it. And Azur's one is being worked on next. Oh my god. Sorry. I didn't I wasn't paying attention to like how many bad guys are there? Right, we're going to watch the explosion this time because we can. What's the explosion look like? Okay, it was just kind of out of control. Oh no, the tower does go down. Okay, I like it. I wonder if we can get some XP for destroying this. Ow. Okay, we can get XP for doing that. I think, why didn't? Azur's story, I don't I don't know if I should ruin what the story is. Like, I don't want to like tell stuff that's kind of like exciting for the girls. But like, I like the four part series ideas, like Emmys one I really like. No, don't spoil it. Okay, I won't spoil it. Um, oh, there's a home tree right there. Actually, I don't know if I should grab it the now. Actually, no, I have access to the Ikaran to fly around the map. So it's not going to be that a deal of us coming back. Newbie would begin a work is a lot. Yes, I like so now that like the scripts are no longer my problem, I get to focus on making the girl short. So Mercy came out with a short and she was like, do you do you think I should have been blonde Senpai and showed like behind the scenes artwork? I'm going to get everyone to do that to show their concept art like me as well. Actually, I need to write the scripts. And like, I get to work on that kind of fun stuff instead of kind of like being stretched too far. Like, it's too easy. It's too easy. I'm not even going to say it's that easy. Um, you can go as well because you were shooting my crime. You're not supposed to shoot my crime. Um, literally, spoiler channel is always looking for literally, uh, just I get so excited about everything that's planned behind the scenes that I'm like, oh, I don't want to ruin it for the girls. Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, here, here, here, here, sorry, sorry. I'm too busy rambling. I'm not even actually focusing on the dang game play. Wait, oh no, we don't want shot them anymore. They've gotten too strong now. That's the problem. If you don't like, um, farm XP, you will fall behind. Concept art was great to see. Yeah, so I get to like kind of do that fun behind the scenes script stuff like the shorts for the girls. Um, um, also super gracious thank you to everyone who is using YouTube clip feature for the girls. Um, if you didn't know, if I go on their stream, I can see who and what has been clipped. I just want to say, uh, there's actually quite a few people who are clipping my burps at the moment. I might unironically make a 15 minute burp compilation just for the heck of it and call it like scrawny burps for 14 minutes and 53 seconds. Uh, and just for the heck of it because it seems to be something, uh, a few, uh, gentlemen seem to enjoy and you know, I'm not here to ruin anyone's day. Uh, but yes, please do consider clipping. We have a really funny, uh, short of icy coming soon. Um, our second clipper, we're kind of testing them out. I don't have a problem because I've already actually got extensive clip history, but they're busy at the moment. So the clips are a wee bit slow to be produced. We're getting there. We're getting there. So thank you to anyone who uses a YouTube clip feature. Does help out any highlight moments? A short of icy doing what? So it's already happened. So it's not a spoiler, but AC basically when, in her adorable voice, like, I'm not very smart. And then she went, thank you so much, Mike, honey, for donating to me and her adorable freaking accent. And I'm like, AC, ACICAL. Should I have taught you that? Should I have said to you what that means? So we're going to, we're going to get turned into a clip, not really sure on her thing. But her accent is so freaking adorable. Okay, I'm going to bed. Rest well. See you in the morning when you wake up, sweet dreams. I love seeing that. I love seeing that. Whenever you guys are like, okay, I need to go to work or I need to go to sleep. I'm like, yeah, see you in the morning. See you in the morning. Oh yeah, work or I'll see you after work. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you didn't go out do some errands. I'll see you after that. I'll still be on. Right. This is the scene. The quote is, Raider, you have got to get to higher ground. It will be repeated a ridiculous amount of times. Yep. I remember the quote. I've not even played this game in many a year. Raider, you've got to get to higher grounds. It will repeat. And I'm like, did no one play test this? Did no one see what an issue this is? Because I've gone the wrong way. I've gone the wrong way. Oh, and I've hurt myself. Let's hurry this up. Who's this section? Oh my God, imagine that coming at you. I would actually be so terrified. Shawnee, you've got to get to higher ground. Honestly. Get that done. Get that done. Right. We destroy one way. Oh, I love it. Love it. Special. What's right? Oh, no. What's my special? I don't know what button the special is, though. Yes, we spawn at checkpoint. It's putting, it's giving me keyboard input, but I'm playing mouse and controller. Like, I don't know if you can hear my analog stick. Right. Let's do that. Another try. That was a bit daft. I do apologize for that MLG game. I'm going the wrong way again. I can't all be good at video games. Literally, wherever nine year old me is inside my head right now, can you like come and like help us out here? Because this is getting very good. It's getting embarrassing. Right. I'm going to click the analog sticks this time to see if that's what the special is instead. Right. Special analog. Nope. That's, uh, nope. That's scan. What would R, what would R be? Am I literally, you know what? I'm just going to hit R and my keyboard. Are you squinting me right now? Oh, Stronny, you've got to get to higher ground. No, Anna, don't throw me. It's so, wait, why is this not breaking? Is there a health bar? Oh, there is. Oh, is it glitched out? I can see that health bar, that little green. What's going on? Thank you for the tip, Anna. Wait, I think it's glitched out. This is an old game. Hold on. Let me do this. I'll do it with a bigger one. Uh, game. Game, you're showing your time. I've never actually had it glitched out here before. Right. I had to press F on the keyboard. I don't know what button I was supposed to press on the freaking, I'm, I would, oh, I keep saying it. Literally, where do you've got to get to higher ground? I literally F in the chat. That's, oh, oh, oh, you're getting whacked, mate. Oh, then you fall now. Oh, he's hiding in the freaking bushes. Right, healing up, healing up, healing up. Don't worry, don't worry. Uh, actually, I think these are much faster. Yeah, these are one shot. The dual wield is one shot, but the long stick isn't one shot. Hmm, what does that mean? Right, okay, we're just going to press the keyboard. We're literally just switching between the keyboard and the ticket thing. I don't know what I'm supposed to press. Get whacked for free, must be nice. Is that the honor you should be watching by any chance? Hmm. Uh, right down we go. I don't know. Are you squiddin' me right now? Virginia! Have you considered getting to higher ground? Stop! No, I'm getting trolled! Thank you for the tip, for so. He repeats it so much, but he's not doing it right now. I wonder, because I don't know why he's not repeating it, but I kid you not, he constantly repeats, you have got to get to higher, you have got to get to higher ground. Over and over and over and over. But, uh, I think we're actually being given, oh, objective. The classic three and done in video games. If Aintbroke don't fix it, do this thing three times and you win. Delicious. Delicious, delicious, delicious. Love it. I love it when game devs get the memory. Oh my god, I'm inside that! I'm inside it! Leave alone! No! Oh no, I'm a... Oh, that's not good. I'm having a seizure. Home tree! Oh, wait a minute. I think I might have died and now I'm at home tree and I'm about to be spiritually be a navi. Like, yeah, spiritually. I'm like physically about to be like 100% navi if I remember correctly. Oh yeah, that's right. Oh, I can feel myself connecting with nature. Oh, I should... Are you with me right now? Wah! Heck yeah, speak for the trees. Thank you, Tim Shotol. For the tip. I can never say that name right. Shotol. Ah! Eh, AWA just resurrected me and AWA's word is truth, so I will not be taking any contesting points that I'm no a navi anymore. Actually, I really enjoyed the second Avatar movie because what's her name? The one that is Sigourney Weaver as a child? I really like her plot line. Eh, that she's like, can commune with AWA? I really like her. Avatar Stoney has an arrow under her hair! There's a second Avatar movie? Yeah, it's called Way of the Water. Did you not get advertised on anything? There's a second Avatar movie. It's out right now. I may have just spoiled it for you. I apologize. If I was home tree, I would tell Stoney to... If I was the home tree, I would tell Stoney to... I don't know what he want. What are you on about? What are you on about? This is a spiritual location. You can't loot the home tree. Okay, I say that as if there isn't a Gen 2 concept right now that may or may not have have some nun influence. You cannot do any activated mission things. Oh, it's the guy! Nothing but more than pure digging. My new abandoned name. Advertising for the second movie was a booze ball. It still did really well, did it not, if I'm not mistaken? Are you underestimating the power? You acting like the tree? Well, it's the Holy Spirit of Navi. Okay, we are going to Swatulu. Anyone else visited Swatulu? Maybe on spring break you went to Swatulu? Yeah, they are absolutely wrecking this place. This is not... This area is definitely getting absolutely wrecked. I just remembered what happens in this area. I'm like Nightmare Potenture. Very good location because something very cool happens. We aren't searching for the dormant site. No, actually, I think it's a later level, you know that? Anyway, it's cool. The first movie itself was already advertised enough for the second. That's probably what they said. That was really outrageous writer, I'm going to be honest. Saying no hablo to a Navi. I don't know, that felt a bit weird to me. I don't think we should let that one slide. That was... That was motivated. That was motivated. That was bizarre. And if you're literally fully Navi, you're not going to put effort into speaking Navi? We're going to unlock the home vision tree. What the heck is that? Oh, it's a tree of vision. Oh, it's a sector challenge. Am I crazy or was there a horse I could ride back here? Thank you, child, me for remembering. Oh my god, I'm actually so smart. What are you? You're just menacingly guarding this horse. Can I just take it? Thanks mate, appreciate it. There are RDAs, but the beautiful thing about these parts of the map, you can ignore it. You can just zoom ahead. This is one of those games where if you want to take your time and explore it, you most certainly can. But if you just want to be like, right, I want to do the objective. I don't want to leave the horse in the middle of here. What am I doing here? Oh no, I don't want my horse to... Wait, investigate. Oh, I'm only to do a drive-by? Oh, I can do a drive-by shooting all right. Don't mind me. Oh, let's go. Right, I don't think you can shoot well on horseback. Sorry, dire horse. It's called dire horse. But yes, I don't mind doing a drive-by. Right, left or right? Both are terrible. This one's a dead end, so do the dead end first and then come back for the open one because it's likely that the open will be like the next progression. Oh, my wee horse is getting injured. Shattered village. Yeah, looks absolutely desolate. Okay, I think the game's putting horses around the map in case we do end up losing. Can you put like samples on horseback? You cannot. Flex and then roll in arse. What do you mean you cannot roll your arse? Can you not iterate what you wish to rock on? I'll just start shoving ours and words that don't even have it. Oh, my poor horse. Oh, it's a mech. It's a mech. It's a mech. It's a mech. Oh, the horse is going to perish. Oh, no, the horse is perishing this game. I don't like it here. Let's get out of this place. Is this the first game? It is. This is not the new game that came out. This is the Archaic 2009 game. Loongeree is not here. Where is Loongeree? Loongeree, where are you, mate? I need to find Loongeree. Any Loongeree fans? I'm a Loongeree fan. Oh, the horse is getting in. Loongeree's gone to stop them. With Unipee. That's right, Riflin. Oh, Unipee's a person. Oh, what did we unlock? Let's see. The Onatopak. What is that? That looks like shards from the sky. That looked cool. I've not actually summoned a horse. What was that? Birds from the sky? Column Pandora to help strike. Oh, my God. Hold on. What does it look like? Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Little baby. Little baby clangs. Okay. Great. We can go through here. Oh, I'm getting shot at. Or is he shooting at an NPC? I don't know. Hello. Do you need assistance? She just expired. I don't know. I don't even speak Navi. I don't even know what her last words were. Oh, my God. Her family's going to be like, what were her last words? And I'm like, I'm so sorry, mate. I'm actually a skypey poll. You're going to have to forgive me, but is there an enemy there? No, that's a boss. Where's the enemy? That's actually really embarrassing. Yeah, we don't know her last words because I'm a dumb dumb. We're playing that. Hello. Are you okay? Are you squiddin' me right now? Brian! I really like the second Avatar movie, especially the scene where they destroy almost everything that was achieved in the first True. Okay, Iron Reaper, thank you for the tip. I'll admit, true. However, I present to you Sigourney Weaver's second storyline, and that's fine with me. I like that she's connected to Pandora, can control Pandora. Okay, to Awa, and Awa grants her those abilities. I don't think she's doing well. Are you going to expire after we finish talking? Because I can't translate your last words to tell your to tell your family. Oh, um, maybe you should expire because that's actually really great. That's really rude. Please don't do that. I need to claim. Please perish. Oh, my bow and arrow is not strong anymore whatsoever. I used to one shot these guys. It's now costing two ammo. Right, so what we have to do is just climb up these and then jump aboard when it comes background, and then we destroy its receiving signal thing, which completely, um, okay, yeah. Do you remember when we played Elden Ring and there is that chariot thing and you had to drop down on top of it? Basically that. We just need to slowly wait for it to turn. Yep, okay. And then when we get close enough, we just jump down. Wait, can I not just, can I not shoot that with bow and arrow? I feel like with their height difference, I could probably bow and arrow that. Uh-huh. Nope. Can't believe Elden Ring stole that idea literally. Uh, right. I think that's just showing, I need to go up on this one. What do you go up on this one? I can see it on the mini map that I'm covering up with my big hair, but the mini map, I wish I could put the mini map in the other corner. I'm always covering up the mini map when I play games. Uh-huh. Hopefully doesn't bother you guys. I assume it's coming around this corner very slowly. Something's trying to shoot up. Are you coming? Hello? Is it stuck? Am I out of its distance to move? Right, you, I can hear you shooting. Knock it off. Stop moving. Oh look, the picture plant. Look, it's sending flies out to hurt him. Death by flies. Death by flies. Oh, he's in. Did he come? I didn't know they could use, no, come back. You need to perish by flies or by bow and arrow. Pick. Fane. Okay, I'm out of the distance. Right, is this not, is it stuck? Why would it be stuck? Oh, fane. I think we're maybe too early. Watch it start moving when I come around this corner. Yeah, I was kind of joking. I was actually joking, but I seriously did it. I knew that. Where's the freaking bane? Where's the bane? Moving again because I'm out of your render distance. I am being pranked. I am being pranked. Wait, did it move? Wait, that is it there. That's it right there. The render distance is broke. Bro, it's going to start moving. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me get up the dang thing. Oh, that's literally the only song I know off by heart. It's actually really sad. There is an anime called Avatar the Last Airbender and Uncle Iroh is an absolute beloved character and he sang a really moving song. It's literally the only song I know off the top of my head. But it's like beautiful sad, not like hopefully not too sad sad, you know? I need to not bring that song up anywhere close to making here. We can not allow it to spoiler. Has Emi not seen it? Please stop it. I'm going to cry. Okay, okay, okay. We pause. We pause. I didn't realize there were bad guys here. Take this and this. Why am I taking so much damage? I don't know. Have I unlocked a new outfit? No, I haven't. Wait, do you see that stat increase though? So as we unlock new outfits, it's going to go up so much. You mean you don't? I don't know Secret Tunnel off by heart. Secret Tunnel. What am I supposed to do? I'm supposed to do something. Hold on. Ah, I see the blossoms. Two lovers forbidden from one another. There's a mountain in the way. And I kind of forget how this next part goes. Secret Tunnel. Brian, I'm singing. Emi's planning on doing it. So she's definitely support emu's when she does that. Definitely. Thank you for the tip, Nero. I kind of forgot how this next part goes. Can you guys put the lyrics in chat and then I'll like sing it to you guys. Shawnee, why have all the Scottish people met? Also nice. Why are Scottish people nice? Oh, we're just, we're just vibing. Scotland, Glasgow's been rated one of the nicest. Oh, we've got level up. We've got level up in our healing and our sprint. So are we like even faster? Oh, wow. Okay. Okay. That was a pretty decent distance. Are you actually a blue guy in this game or are you a skin walker like the movie? We have, our human body has died. It got annihilated via missiles. So yeah, we're like, we're Navi now. We're just trying to get accepted by the Navi and to reverse the horrific effects that I'm actually not very skilled at this bit. Oh, jeez, Louise. Oh my god, they like ate my health up so quickly. So this is what I mean by you get a second chance. I now have four second chances. Oh my goodness. Get right. He's perished. Oh my gosh, that was right. He's off of it. I don't know if I need to like unironically XP grind or something. I feel like I die. I think I'm okay. Where are we? Where are we? Oh my gosh. I don't remember the game being so hard. Do you know that? I'm just getting over here like, bro, I'm out. You don't need to worry about me. I'm gone. I'm in and out like a flash. Call me you same boat. I'm gone. 10 seconds. No, not leaves from the vein. The other one, the happier one, the two lovers one, not leaves from there. That's a sad one. Scots are nice until you tear us off. Honestly. Oh my god. Yeah, I'm trying not me to. We don't want to be sad up in here. Good times. Good vibes. Two lovers forbidden from one another and the moon ends in the way. I have no idea what it is. Stroney, you just channeled some intense dark souls energy by spam rolling away from the attackers. Honestly, though, I should probably pick up cell samples because I ended up using two revives for that. I definitely need an armor upgrade, because. Okay, ready to lovers forbidden from one another award their people and a man and evades them apart. You must build a path to be together. And I kind of forgotten how the rest of it goes, but secret tunnel, secret tunnel. It's such a good song. There we go. A little sing song for you. A little karaoke before the actual karaoke stream is planned. Have a look. I've got to stop. That will get stuck in my head for months. Oh, do you want the Scottish version of it? So it's extra cursed. Wait, someone refit the lyrics in again, and I'll do the Scottish version for you, because I'm just so kind like that. Okay, so the one thing about close combat is the instant. I said the instant die. Thank you. Right, Scottish version. If someone puts the lyrics in chat for me, just so I can go. My brain's a little slow. Two lovers forbidden from one another award evades their people and a man and Brian, you're interrupting my singing, Brian. Well, I'm getting absolutely. Award divides their people. All right. Oh, sugar. Thank you for the tip. I'm getting too distracted. I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes. Thank you for tipping that. You didn't have to tip that. Thank you. I do appreciate anyway. Right, right. Scottish version. Two. Wait, should I do really neasily, Scots? Two lovers forbidden from one another award evades their people and a mountain divides them apart and build a path a be together. Yeah, and I forget who the next couple of lines go, but then it goes. Secret tunnel. Secret tunnel through the mountain. Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel. I think I need to go and visit for this next section. Anyway, that's the Scots rendition. You're welcome for that on the house. Didn't even have to pick. Why Bonaro? Why? I'll go invisible if I'm going to end up perishing, I think. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. These turrets on the wall are my biggest enemies. Got a lot of enemies and it's the turrets on the wall, not the actual thing. Strana, just had any idea for your outfit. What about a version with all of your modesty plasters are replaced by nicotine patches, honestly? What is going on? I don't, sorry, I really don't remember this section, so I don't know what I'm up against, but I'm just going to take it slow. Not knowing we're taking it a bit slow. I'm just a bit, I can see something over there. Oh, he's destroying the car. I see empty mechas. What's that up there? Can I destroy these for XP? Hold on. Oh, wow. Oh, I'm doing a task sector destroying empty mech. Oh, wow, they explode as well. That's actually really good to know that they explode. Okay, there we go. I press X to do that, ultimate. Strana, do I smoke? No, I just talk too long and my voice is fried. Do you need help with this? You want to gang violence this car because you're like taking your sweet time. That's going to blow up, bro. That's going to blow up. Oh, it didn't hurt him though. Oh, I get a lot of XP for doing that. I don't know if we need to farm yet. If we get too weak, we'll farm, but at the moment we are above the thingy. Watch out. I know what challenge to destroy something. This looks very battle, don't ask, but I don't recall. I just heard an Ikram. I think that was an Ikram. Is this the person we need to find? Because I don't think he's looking too good. Are you okay? Yeah, you need, you need, oh, he needs some milk. Right, I'm sorry. It was too obvious, right? That's how you get wrecked. Don't want to get hit that much, but it's literally the best I can do. All things considered. Okay, that special attack knocks them over. That's really good to know. Okay. Heal, heal, heal, heal. Okay, that bought me time, that bought me time, that bought me time. Okay, two out of three. Wait, that didn't damage me? That explosion didn't damage me. Okay, let's go. Okay, okay, that wasn't that bad. I thought that was going to be like insane battle door mask type stuff, but we're safe. Strony's inky milk. Strony's inks milky. Hold on a minute. Someone, someone described my homemade yogurt as glippy. I have not forgiven you for such descriptions since. Is there an enemy over here? Whoa. The fricking, the, wait, how much do I have to redo? Because I was like deep in that. Okay, I don't have to redo much. The plane took me away with it. I bumped away, man. I bumped away, bro. As far as I'm aware, this game has infinite lives. I probably would never have finished it if I didn't because, you know, I didn't make it. Glippy. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn't, that is so cheating. They have, they had pre-spawned in. Go away. You can shoot me through that because I can't shoot you. I'm going to have to be in viz to claim up this. Oh my gosh. Where did, where did they go? Right. I need to... Oh, lovely. Okay, there we go. Yeah, I'm not one shot nothing. Just so the screen isn't too red. There. Jeez, Louise. Oh, I almost didn't make that. Can I destroy this? Oh, I can. Take that. I didn't get any XP for that. So that's great. Something. Honestly. Oh, my Icaran's here. I thought my Icaran was going to come and get me. Okay, it's because it's exploding. My Icaran is coming to get me. Okay, let's see what we're working with. Whoa. I don't like that. I messed up. I'm sorry. I even brought attention to my existence. Please, please, please. I'm just a Navi. I'm just a, I'm just a sweet innocent Navi. I'm sorry. I tried to pick on you, Mr. Car. I'm sorry. My goodness. That Warthog is powerful. Oh my goodness. It was just a little arrow. My gosh. And let me up. Literally light them up. I want that thing up. Blast it out of the sky. Oh my goodness. That was not good. Right. You're standing up now. So you feel a bit better. Good. Oh, a great warrior. Oh, you were hating on me about 20 minutes ago. Hmm. Don't think I, I didn't forget. You're, you're a little hatey. Okay. Goodbye. Oh, I'm called Dreamwalker now. I'm no longer a sky people. I'm a dream. So let me shoot an arrow at this armed vehicle. Look, I have some good ideas and I have some bad ideas. That was a bad idea. Oh, oh, there's, what the heck is this? What did I do with that? Oh, we got an unlock. What did we get? I'll look up. Invis for longer. Oh, we've got a bow and arrow upgrade and a weapon upgrade. Oh, look, her bow has changed. Look, it's a different design now. See, that literally is such a cross game. Right. What am I supposed to do with these crystals? Excuse me. I'm actually, here we go. I guess I'm to follow the crystals because it's doing the little light. So, okay. It's to follow it. I was, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. We're safe. My goodness. I don't know what I need in order to survive other than an armor upgrade, but those warthogs are so unforgiving. I was a mecha as I've unlocked now. See, we're starting to get out of the tutorial where the game does not forgive. Like the game will annihilate you if you don't like level up and stuff. Oh, my horse is getting really shot out there. I didn't like that. I didn't enjoy that. More enemies. It's impassable. Oh, for God's sake. No, Mr. Horsey. Please do not. Wait. Gang violence. Gang violence. The horses. Oh, no, my horse. Oh, my horse just perished, but I saw him attack on the leaf. That's two games where the horse actually helps you. Okay. We're just going to have to take the rest on foot, sadly. Oh, oh, do they attack me if I'm Navi? I feel like. Oh, oh, it's so beautiful. Yeah, I really don't want them to attack me. I'm definitely picking up. Rider, come in. I've only got a few seconds to talk. Falco's gathering harmonics to find something called a well of souls. Well of souls. You don't say. Falco's planning to use it to wipe out the Navi. I'll try to find out more. I was hoping they didn't attack. I was hoping they didn't attack. Oh, I've gone the wrong way. I'm getting too distracted. Oh, I don't want to hurt the whale blade. It just sucks. Wait a minute. What did she call me? Raider? I hardly even know her. Oh, you didn't. You didn't like that one? I guess. Yeah, I guess I repeated it. I'm sorry. Yeah. Okay. I won't recycle jokes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is that? Oh, I can't see. Okay, I'm sorry, but you guys are going to have to go. I really wish they wouldn't attack. Oh, hello. Are you the person I need? Man who is not man, a Navi who is not Navi. You are a puzzle, piece of Ewa's puzzle. Oh, okay. I'm dreamwalking. Are we got an upgrade? I thought no scrawny stream today. Are you sure about that? She be a reminder. Okay. For those of you who are listening in are a part of the hair M. She be cotton bum is going live in T minus. Four minutes. She may actually be on the loading screen. Eh, but yes. If there's any new YouTube mods lurking, you are welcome to speak, but then I remove your speaking privileges instantly. Class of 09. What is Class of 09? Have you guys played that? scrawny streams never end. The return all hail the endurance cut off is. As I play the Navi part, I did it later as a human. Wrong. I've literally never done the RDA save. We will take. Oh, look how beautiful this is. Literally glowing in the dark is just stunning. Oh, could you imagine it with graphics that are updated? Like, I have no idea what's in the new avatar game. Maybe we should play it for the first time together, but I think it is as beautiful as this. Right. Why am I here? Oh, to get these crystals. Okay, we're just going to ignore. Because if we can just run in and out of these sections, if you hang around and kill anything, yes, you will get faster XP. Oh, I don't want my horse to die. I'm so sorry. Oh, Mr. Horsey, please don't die. Oh, no. Oh, no. Come on. We need to get out of here. Like right now, I don't want you to pass away. I want you to have a happy life and retire at your old age. Okay. And wait, this horse here is getting attacked as well. I was beating up that mech. I was going to actually take it so this one can live its little retirement out. But oh, I don't know if we're going to make it if they've got flipping flamethrowers and I've got the wrong way because again, all turned around. Oh, please live, little horsey, please live. Oh, no, the horsey is not going to. Right, that's it. We're clearing this. We're clearing this out. Leave my horse alone. Everything is so strong. Who? Who? Who? You, perish. Gosh. I don't have anyone to take out my special one. Right, I'm healing because we're going to end this. Wait, I actually came out in your avatar. Yeah, there's a new one. Didn't check it out. Yeah. I'm going to take more samples because I've actually only got three. Wait, how far away? It's a wee bit away. It's a wee bit away. All right, we are going to pick up cell samples just. No, my horse was still going to retirement. You're so mean. Ow. Did that plant just smack me back? Fine. My horse is already passed away. Man, he had a pension fund and everything. Imagine working your whole life. Actually, I read a story about like that where someone like worked their whole life and they got one week of retirement and passed away and it was like, I would, I would be so mad. I would be so mad. I would explain to death himself like, look, mate, I've kind of sweat my whole life. Dread Brian. By the way, I'm not sure if it was you who asked, but it was someone invalid asked if the Black Ops two servers were fixed. Me. The answer is yes, the servers were fixed, but bear in mind, it's still the Black Ops two servers. If you know you know. I remember the game couldn't be played by streamers on the basis of like a super easy to get like your IP going. But if they fixed it, honestly, Black Ops with the boys. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have a little drink. Have a sipping tin. Thank you very much for the tip. Tarja, I appreciate that. Yeah. Shawnee, the horse is only looking for three days anyway. Well, in Pandora, I'm going to hang with sheep now. Yes, have fun with sheepsters. She's live with Class of O'Nane, which I actually don't know what the good is about. Imagine had reals ifs that basically happened to. Oh, I'm sorry. But yeah. Oh, we must draw harmonic from tree. Oh, I think I know where this is going to go. Oh, okay, that line delivery was a bit. No, long glory. No, we fling. I will say one thing for the VAs of this game, especially for older games in the past, odds are they had no idea what the scene actually had and they were just given a script and just said like they don't know the depth of the script or what occurred. It was only until like recent stuff like where actors can see live what they're performing. So follow the sound of vibrations and find tuning points. Okay, if there's three, it's probably going to be like identical. Yeah, okay. Wait, hold on. Yeah, okay. And then the last one's going to be like right here because of the way triangles work. Yeah, I love triangles. What's your yeah, yeah, you know what? Favorite shape. I'm going to give it in our rectangle triangle or rectangle for favorite shape. Oh, it's singing to me. Hold on. I feel like something mystical is about to happen. I'm actually getting a bit scared. I just checked. Oh, no. We must take this home back to home tree. It's a wooden delivery. Get it because of the trees. It was a wooden delivery. Oh, I came up with that myself came up with that comment myself. I'm so witty as a streamer, aren't I? I'm just going to start stealing your guys's like witty comments and then doing that over Oh, I have a new armor. New armor. Oh my god, girl game, girl game. Oh yeah, like the protection. What is vitality? More health. I have more health overall because of the armor. Yeah, well, you can see where they added more armor onto me. You have solved content creation. Oh, that's proper harmonized. Yeah, good luck hitting them. Armor barely covers anything. And honestly, like they are using right. We're going to home tree. Wait, we're going back to home tree. What? I'm about to report to them that. Oh, by the way, longer these dead. I'm going to cry from that joke literally what cry of pain or just like just like how ridiculous it was. Okay, we are going to be polite to Ewa and respect the home tree by not doing backflips all the way up the trunk of the tree. Okay. Oh my god, it's tree balls. We love tree balls. Let's just get very bright in here. I'm not going to lie. Do I need to recalibrate? Hold on. I'm like a professional streamer. I think I need to recalibrate my muscles. Okay, there we go. Recalibrating, meet your virtual, recalibrate it. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Oh, we did actually report longer is passing. Okay. You have the song. No, no, how but yeah, I scored the not the thumbs up. That was so human of you. Please don't do that again. A little tap on the shoulder. Sing. What am I saying? Am I actually to say is this like a mini game where any like what on earth is this freaky stuff going on here? I don't even remember that at all. Thumbs up. Let's just try to come there. It is the first step in our path. How many steps we got? Find location is one step. Okay. Speaking to Ewa is another. Okay. This demands the need of a the first voice. Only the first voice awakens well of souls. So this is campaign mode getting explained to us. I totally know the plot inside out from this game. Yeah. Assassin's Creed. I know the plot of this. All I know is that we're doing good for the planet. Easy on the mumbo-jumbo stuff. No, please, even if not directed at me, they hurt anyway. What if the trees wanted to see a sick backflip? Mission complete. Mission complete. Oh, not to jump around. Jump up. Can I put my weapons away? I feel like having weapons out in this location isn't very pleasant. No, put the RDA gun on me. Why is this so bright? I don't ever... Oh my god. I don't ever recall that issue. Hmm. Oh, hello again. I would like to talk to you for my next mission. We go to Toroknari. Toroknari. I hear the human Thalco seeks your death. We will not let this happen. You know, spending five years in cryo. Thank you, Tenjala. War is new to this world. It must not happen again. Never on the enemy side. But we're the goodies, so they're the enemy. We're healing nature. We're healing nature. Mother nature always reclaims all. Mother, mother, mother, mother nature. Oh, this looks like a dark room out. Beautiful. Toph is the Marvel boy? I can't really do later voices like Toph. Oh, Katana. Look, there's the castle. That's what I would say if I could see something. If I wasn't blind. I can't really hear a voice at all. Is it a castle? There's something in the sand or the library? There's the library. Katana. Oh, sorry. It's not Katana. Sorry, sorry, sorry. It's upside down, isn't it? Katana? Close enough. I know. I know. Katana wins. Good luck, Tenjala. Good luck, Tenjala. All right. Good luck, Tenjala. Hi. Oh, who's this? Hello. How do you do? You come for shards. That must wait. Oh, I need a pause on the shards. Post-trump on the shards. A little cheeky hydration check. A little cheeky hydration. There's the library. That's the way it would sound like the phone about the body. Longer speak. Oh, okay. I'm going to say something controversial. You know when maps are straight ahead like this? Yeah? I like that. I appreciate when games don't make you go back and forth and you just keep going forward. When a game makes you turn around to go do something on the map that you previously had that area. However, when a game makes it nice and linear, not going to lie, I almost fell off there. Oh, and I can't actually see where I'm supposed to go. Thanks to this leaf. Oh, here we go. Backtrack. Hey, yeah, backtracking a bit. Okay, let's see how it goes. Okay, so if you take the high ground, wait, look, that's why they attack me. They've got backpacks on the wolves and that's why they attack me. The RDA put like main control devices on the wolves and now they want to attack me even though I'm Navi. I'm Navi and I'm navigating. What the heck am I doing here? Am I destroying stuff? Don't have to ask me twice. What am I doing? Challenge complete, right? I'm going to do it from up here. Oh, I see. So I'm releasing the native Navi and destroying them. Jesus. Why? Yeah, we're like literally so low level. We're not even one shotting. Can I break you? Oh, I can't. I like how he just don't. Oh, he like dives over. I mean, honestly, if an arrow struck me, probably. Oh, we did it. Like Ori in the blank forest. I true. Wait, wait, wait. What am I supposed to do with that? Destroy it? I'm just going to pump. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me pump all the ammo into it. Where's my gun? I can't. Yeah, your height, you're teasing me. I'm not even hitting you, bro. You're literally right under the tree. I'm going to have to go. No, stop shooting me. I need to destroy this. Hello. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Oh, no. Game. Game. Did I need to hit the other side of it, I guess? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, done. Jeez, Louise. They are killing us here. That was very strange, but we did it. That's the main thing. Right here. We should not. Are you trying to shoot that guy and you're missing like horribly? Oh, you are. Oh, and I'm missing horribly too. You know that both of us are as bad as each other. He healed as I, bro, come on. Hello, would you like to talk to me? Oh, I'll just keep talking. Backtracking works if the map is good. Yes, I would argue yes. I did try and play Ori in the blind forest, but I was just too paid to pay go. It's definitely not a stream game for me, but one of the other girls most likely would play it. I feel like it's a, I definitely chill stream, chill stream. Yeah. This is actually a really beautiful map because you get to run along the little tree roots, which I really like. Yay, nature. Nature wins again. Uh, right. I can see, and we're maybe fighting here or are we, huh, are we just running through this? Oh, wow. We actually did pretty decent damage. Yeah. Wow. I'll take that. I don't, I don't, I think that was just a payable drill haul. Super. Are they cute? I can only, I'm okay. Hold on. I, it doesn't seem like an objective area because of that reason. I'm just going to do this. I know I shouldn't. I know I should probably like level up a bit, but I am very happy just to keep walking on the tree trunks. You want a non chill stream? Place a list. I've seen a lot of streamers place a list. Like, it's interesting to see what like, um, oh, I'm in trouble. Uh, oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, I'm in trouble. Oh my goodness. I do not remember being in so much trouble playing this game. What's the way? I think it's maybe I used to farm areas to level up and I was just so OP because I think this map, we're actually supposed to be unlocking a green armor right now, but I ain't doing it. Apologize dude. Just doing some backflip, literally backflip dodge and bullets. Right. We're getting ready to attack these guys, but I need to actually activate the quest by talking to this guy before we attack and release more of Pandora's. Me? How can I help? You would not like my answer. Listen, like it or not, you've got my help on this one. String. The tattooed lord of sky machines with weapons. Was it, I think for anyone who did actually watch the first Avatar movie, I think scum means like idiot or something like that. Like scum. You have to go like scum. Or else you're not saying it right. Yeah, I feel like I replayed and leveled up a lot more as a child and right now we're just like speedrunning through this. Although when you do complete a mission, you do get like a nice chunk of XP. So speaking of leveling up, I have a six minute timer at the top of the screen. That looks like a protection spell that I am putting on. I didn't realize I unlocked some sort of protection thing. I definitely want to put whatever that is. Greatly reduces. Yeah, okay. Yeah, we'll definitely be utilizing that right woman to do. Right, let's test this out. I'm about to destroy the ship. Jump up here. Hello. Oh wait, I can just, yeah. Is this what I'm supposed to destroy? Oh yeah, okay, it is. Oh yeah, take that. You like that? Yeah, you're like a big adult. Oh, am I going to get a blood raid because it's facing me now? I'm getting, I'm getting shaky, I'm getting scared. Okay, we're fine, we're fine. Like honestly, smooth sailing. Okay, the NPCs aren't really locking onto me too well because of the distance. But we're making it, we're making it. They're getting a bit closer, so we might have to actually start shooting them a wee bit, just a wee bit. Oh, that was a good shot there. One more, and then that's three of four. You're telling me that quad aerial thing can stay up with three? I don't believe it. One more, two more. I'm not hitting that at all. It's not registering. I'm just going to spam it in. Am I supposed to go up? Of course, the thing I want is like not facing me. Is this one in the corner? Okay, there we go. Hey, wait, wait, I just, I'm looking at it. Sound like a human iron birdie, I'm just saying. Literally. The steel a crann is no match for me. I'm going to loot this stuff. I've got three revives. Oh my gosh. Oh, the poor babies, they're not even attacking us. Out you come, baby. Wait, so, okay, it looks like regular ones don't attack me anymore. Hello? Yes. I think we're going to raid him. Oh, they're so cute. We're helping the little forest critters. What do you need? I'm sorry, medications for the big guy. Oh, just basic flowers. That's fine. I can get that. That's no problem. Hold on. Hold that thought, little guy. I'm coming back. And then I think we get to ride him into battle like a horse, but it's not a horse. I think it's called a Thanator. If I remember correctly. Oh my goodness. I remember that time I said in this map, you don't have to backtrack. Honestly, it's not that bad though, because it's to help an animal. And, you know, we shadow wizard money gang. We love healing nature from these parts. I'm going in. Oh, I'm getting sprayed and prayed, but they can't get me. I'm too good. Gather plants from the banshee's nest. Oh, that's what that is. I suppose we'd be comfortable with that. Pandora is Ohio, but more natural. You're not allowed to speak for the next 20 seconds. Do you understand me? Don't say that again. I'm so excited for your ace mushroom. I just want new earbuds for it. I hope it's not a disappointment. I most likely will not do ear licking. I'm just going to say that now before anyone gets thingied. I have no idea what an earth is going on with YouTube and ear licking at the moment. Something, there's either a policy update being pushed or something, but for some reason anime ear licks bad. In real life, human person ear licks fine. So I don't want you to be disciplined. I have put a lot of thought and effort into it, so hopefully the Acemari is good. I don't know how long I'm going to stream for. And the problem is I get really distracted when I constantly read your guys' stuff because you guys make me laugh all the time. So I'm not really sure how official an Acemari is going to be. I'll probably try hard for like 15 minutes and then it's just going to... Oh, that's so cool. Has Ava gone mad? No, Ava has blisters. Whiskers, honestly though. We whiskers. It's impossible because YouTube can't tell the difference. That's my theory at the moment is that anime is getting... because YouTube are saying it's implied else. Whereas we all know what actual ear licking sounds like because it's literally a 3D microphone. So it's really put in a bit of a hindrance on my plans. Oh my gosh. Is this not the coolest ride you've ever seen? Oh my god, it's so cool. Oh, he leaves. Can he go faster? Oh, he attacks. Oh, that's so cool. Can he jump? Oh no, that's not jump. Oh wait, wait. Do I move as it moves? Oh, oh man. Can you jump? Oh, I love him. He's so slick looking. Like genuinely so slick. Not a hair on him. How do you keep warm? I'm fine. Like almost. Laughing was the highlight you'll be fine. Come on, buddy. Come on, whiskers. Let's get him. Wait, am I going back? Oh, I'm just going back to talk. It's just like, literally, it looks like he's been dropped in tar or the perv thing, but it's just how he is. A little hairless thing. I don't like hearing this kind of stuff. Okay. Why? Do not speak like you understand. Why is she so informal when talking to this guy? You have to pick your battles, B. This guy is speaking a second language. At least try and speak clear English, you know? So it's easier for him. Danny, go back before it's forward. Okay. There we go. You ready, whiskers? Oh, I did not mean to do that, but that was absolutely horrifying. Right. Come on, whiskers. Let's get him. Hopefully you have a lot of health, whiskers, because I'm not doing any combat at all. Ah, whiskers. Can you go across this stuff? You can. Oh, you're actually such a smart kitty, honestly. You're a smart kitty. Okay. I auto-jump if it's quite a... Oh, there's a two, please don't attack, question mark. I don't think they attack me anymore. Speaking of contact, the enemy's got a lot of enemies. Okay. We're all good. Whiskers made it into a happy attack. There's another whiz... How many whiskers are there out there? There's so many of them again. Bingoes. Some mate like the... What is going on in the background? Uh, cutscene moment? Cutscene moment, hello? Cutscene moment, hello? Oh, I think I'm stuck in it. Just absolutely chaos in the background, by the way. Endgame... Oh, and we've got to level up as well. Right, we need to help out that whiskers. Right, hold on. Leave whiskers alone. What's going on here? Stop it. Wait, what's going on? Right, I'm just going to do melee for the sticks. It's just so easy and quick. Why no health? Why no health? I'm doing my spell. Am I supposed to be on whiskers? I think I'm supposed to be on whiskers. Tear them up, whiskers! Tear them up! That's right. Who's a good kitty? You're going to get some treaties after this. I'm just going to do whiskers for the crazy in the background, honestly. Just a reminder that Sheevee Cottonbump is alive if you care to watch classes all night. Oh, this is so cool. Oh no, my kitty's losing health. I can't heal him. Oh, baby. I don't want you to perish. I want you to have happy retirement. Oh, there's no way kitty's going to deal with these mechs without being perished. Unless I put him away. Right, you stay there. Oh, my goodness. And I don't have my protection spell yet. I don't have protection spell. I'm literally... Oh, kitty, I might need you back. Kitty, I might need you back. Kitty, where are you? Kitty, you're saving me, kitty. Yes, knock them over. Yes! Yes, oh, you're so smart. You're so smart. You're so smart. Oh, you're such a good party party. Right, I do need to heal in a moment, but I think we're doing all right. What's going on here? You're... You've glitched out and you're not even fighting alongside me, so that's fine. Oh, the kitty... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal. Oh, I've casted protection. I've casted protection. I did crash protection, but I was too late because I healed first. I should have done it. Okay, okay, we can do that. This is super easy to get them. Where are they? Where's all the ones? Where are they? Two more? Oh, there you are. Okay, we're done. Oh, there's three more. I'm telling you, peppers. Hopefully, the cat didn't die then. Okay. Actually, I'm gonna... Oh, wait, no, this is okay. Right, okay. Yes, yes, yes, this turns to the corpus. I cast skill issue, honestly. Okay. Yes, we can do that. One more shard and then we do a song. A little song and dance. Oh, I crammed. Oh, that is really rough. That was a rough landing with the animation on the navi there. I have to admit, you're bending with the element there. Right, let's unlock the home tree. No, not home tree. Tree of vision, which lets you teleport around the map. Yeah, it was crunchy. That was crunchy. That was 2009 showing. I never know how long these bigger games take to develop. I still think it's like three years development, two years development. This smallest development game tank crunch I ever heard was Fallout New Vegas. That was like big like that. I think they said it was 11 months development, which was crazy, all things considered. Uh, I think we just walked the rest of the Raider hardly even or anything else to brighten my day. Okay, so I'll stop making that joke. I'm sorry. It's a ticking time bomb. We can't let Fowler get anywhere near the well. She's can't keep getting away with it. Hey, am I supposed to find my Gornu? Are you feel health, kitty? Oh, you're not even readable, actually. I'm not supposed to read them anymore. Yeah, I know. I know. Right. I won't do it anymore. God, give it some bit. A 15 year old game. Look, look, look. They did actually come some pretty decent games like back then. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, Brian. Last one for today. I got to go night night. Good night. Thank you for the tip, Virginia. Good night, and I'll see you in the morning. How long are you two hours in? So statistically we have like four. Oh, no, no one's sleeping in four hours. I'm a nation must die. Do you wish to help us or not? Yes, I'll help you, my goodness. Honestly, yeah, you actually do deserve a bit sass. Right, we're okay. Yeah, just go ahead. Whoa. What am I supposed? What animal? Am I supposed to eliminate? Oh, actual cutscene. Yeah, we do not get actual cutscenes like this often. Oh. Oh, sorry, I'm petting my hair right now. My hair is up in a bun. I'd rather that sounded rather old. Two and a half. Stony, you get one more of those jokes for all your jokes become unfunny. I don't have any more sound effects to do it with. I don't have any more sound effects. That's them all. So I can't make the joke again. I've only got crickets now. I really don't like hurting these guys, but if they're baddies, there's nothing I can really be. I give you, I send you back to Awa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's a lot more of you in this plane, this pen than I thought. Jeez. What am I supposed to destroy in here? That. Uh, I hope this works. Uh, I cast protection. I cast protect- I re- I'm stuck in the corner. I cast protection. Okay, thank God this game is so buggy. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean to heal. I wasted that heal. Oh, this is making me nervous. Haha, you can't come on the rock. You can't come on the rock. Most games for older games, elevation really bugs out the AIs that they have. So don't be afraid to use elevation to your advantage because then you get moments like this where you can just have a good time because they can't get on the elevation. Okay, for you. Glad that's over because that is really not an easy enemy to defeat in the world. My gaspan bug rug. Shawnee, you seem to have upgraded upgrades available top left. Wait, actually though. No, I don't, I don't, unless it's that. Greatly improved damage for a short amount of time. Hmm. Yeah, like for some reason, if you don't like tab over these, it'll constantly tell you you have like weapon upgrades and stuff. What else have I got? Yeah, so like things get more like stronger as we progress. I could do a club, honestly. Let's see the club. What does it look like? Oh, that's a meaty swing. Oh, that's a load up though to get that. That's quite a load up. Oh, yeah, that it doesn't. Okay. No, this is for these guys. It's the double. It's the double for me. Oh, why would you guys even be in a broken facility? Be honest, right now. Oh, why? How are you even getting me through a fence? Well, I need to aim. You need to reload. So which one of us is going to go down first? Yeah, the club's too slow. I'm just gonna go for it. Okay. Yeah, one shot with the things I'll take. Is there anyone else here? I hear him. I hear him. I can't see him. Oh, he's so tiny. Oh, you're so tiny. I can't even see it. Ha, ha, ha. You're welcome. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Gang up, on, gang up, on. That's what I get for making a joke. Spank, spank, spank. Hello, scrawny. There was no notification for your human discord. Discord hates me. I can't believe it. I'm not discord's little kitten or whatever. I said anything that thing. Shibi is live right now with Classable 9 if that game is more of an interest to you because I'm literally playing the most like unknown game ever. I don't know if this game out on PlayStation and that as well. I don't remember it being... oh there's a Thanator in here. Where is it? Oh I hear it. Where is it? Oh it's literally right there. We'll just spray it down. Oh I'm already out of ammo. Oh I thought I thought I thought I thought I was going to be like coded. Oh okay now he's not coded to go any further. I was going to say I'm like I didn't think it was coded to go any further. This is another thing about older games. You can like just absolutely smurf them because there's only so much game memory and game storage that they can allocate for areas which means coding wise they will just stop enemies from doing stuff like that. I just love it. I appreciate it so much. Like it just makes everything nice and easy. Peasy lemon squeezy. What you got to complain about? Huh? What you got to complain about? I know the game did come out on PlayStation 3. Okay okay so it wasn't... I didn't think it was an Xbox exclusive but I don't think it ever got released on Steam. What? I don't know. Hi it's done. It's done. Hydration check. Your own people would not have you so you come to us. I'm gaming. I'm not doing this for me. There's a lot more to cheese. I'm cheeseing it. I'm not smurfing it. Cheeseing it. Do you think I enjoy this? How much do I need to play for that? I've never done it. I've genuinely never done it. I don't think so you don't need to pay anything at all. I've gone to an RDA. I assume the RDA is just like congrats you've destroyed the planet thanks and then the credits just roll. That's how I imagine the RDA side ends. Are you proud of yourself for beating a helpless NPC? Hold on I'm getting rolled. Oh my armor! I just noticed that my armor. Oh my god girl moment. Oh my god fashion show. Fashion. I've got a passion. Whoa look at that protection walk. Are you squidding me right now? Today I learned that if you click on the hashtag smuttlefish hashtag in the stream description one of the first videos shown is the pufferfish gagging on a character video. Truly perfect. Actually thank you for the tip. Sorry y'all. Oh that poor little guy. But yeah fashion show momento. So human basic armor. A little bit of an upgrade and then we've got like location based armor. I knew it so hopefully we can take a wall open now because are we faster as well? Oh who's here? Oh why are you here? This is Navi. I'm destroying Pandora just trying to input these guys. Let me put my glycs on. Can I see none? I'm invisible. You shouldn't be shitting me anymore. I'm literally invisible. Am I going to heal naturally or do I need a pulp to heal? I need a pulp to heal. Take this. Oh I see the TNT thing. I'm going to grab the crystal before it gets me as I don't go to craft. Get me out here. Get me out here. Get me out here. Oh that sprint is so good. Oh my I just came out of nowhere. He blinked and he was gone. Oh need to pick up more samples. Oh get me out of here. There's too much. If they start having like knock back that's when it gets dangerous like being in the middle of the enemies. So do forgive me if I literally just blow past all these sections. Oh I can do that. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Okay okay we're we're getting so mo. Oh that's such a good thing. Ah see when they do that they stall you. That's when you get this. Oh no no no. It's literally TNT in the sky. Okay we made it. We made it. Let me just unlock this little tree of vision. You can't see me no. The vitality and protection boost. Yeah. What about the corp? Did you find out why they're pulling out? Why are you pulling out? Hmm. You don't want to pull out there? Okay we've got our second song so does that mean we need to do a third song and then we're who? Am I to talk to? The Banshee? Teleport? Wait what am I supposed to do? It's on to happen. It says yellow on the map. Am I supposed to read the ikran? No. I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention. The willow tree? The willow tree? Am I to use this to teleport to here to get to home tree? What? Wait was there a thing back? No not conquest. No not conquest. No no no no. We don't want to do conquest. You must do it at the end of the game. No no no. I already know how to play. Thank you. No conquest. Not now. Was there something I was supposed to pick up back there? I feel like I don't know. Child support scary. Is there a crystal? Oh dumb. Dumb dumb dumb dumb. Gee I wonder if it's supposed to go here on this conveniently place little island thing. Okay I was gonna I need something. Now what was the third one here? Yeah okay okay don't make it too don't make it too obvious video game devs don't even need yellow paint in this game. Okay we have the song. My apologies. I was rather confused there. I'm becoming na-vi na-vi na-vi na-vi. You bring hope for the future. Give our call. We bring this song before ta-i. The battle moves swiftly. I fear humans are a step ahead of us. We must return song to home. Mercy's just DM'd me. Strongly my alt twitter's growing really fast. I'm scared but under the tweet I'm getting nervous. Should I post this? Yeah you can post what you want. I'm gonna reply. Mercy you can you can post what you like my darling whether whoever makes you happy. Yeah I have replied to Mercy. Farah Yandere she sure does love being like on ironic this is gonna sound really weird when I say this out loud. She sure does love being a good girl and getting permission for everything Farah Yandere. Like literally all of the girls are so fantastic. And so we're slowly getting past the stage of do I need permission to do this? Because the answer is always no you do not need my permission you're in control. So I was the same. The best kind of Yandere. Yeah damn need some sunglasses to get up this tree. But yes the girls are definitely easing into the concept that because I assume you know they've consumed enough kind of like oh most future agencies like have this long list of rules that you have to abide by and it's like my rules are like literally you know be cool with lollipop stuff and no no male collabs and you know that's it. It gets really simple you do everything yourself I'm not going to tell you what to do I'm going to dictate your content. So Brian. Yes you can post whatever you want my dear mercy leaks classified military documents war thunder style. I know about that if you didn't know military documents keep getting leaked in a video game because people are like they're like so like wanting everything to be correct which is hilarious thank you for the tip Farah. But that's like true real and true because what I'm sure one of them was like they were arguing over a helicopter detailed design either in the cockpit or something to do with a helicopter and then someone was like so Tismo they were like no you're wrong and here's why and then they just like flop down these like documents that shouldn't be publicly accessible um and it's happened with the law. Okay we're singing a second song I'm going to assume by the third song we will progress to the next story part element is good good let me try a rumble nun will soon be found okay it's a little weird daily so many stuff challenger tank manlet armor but it in a Eurocopter shells etc it's happened 15 to 17 times bro bro was like slams on desk see I told you so now this gen is blessed truly guide you to your next like it wasn't even one country leaking the info it was all of them together just so that the the equipment and tanks and all that were accurate in game the next song there's literally a joke zero days since last military leak she sees what you may become they don't like to be wrong exactly great honor I'm just someone who gave me a song back home we call that a DJ oh he she just stroked his chest didn't you worry mate I just collect the songs look beyond the cup that's already full og san says as he drinks it means uh they are a Ramu a certain dominance honestly actually leaks really five and seven but other times they were export uh restricted but it could be found online I'm really proud to belong to the war thunder community for their dastardly arcs the forest burns our warriors flee before the humans these are drinking what hmm the rda must be gunning me and me I say actually all of them you know what well that's it all of them we can't escape the the p-corp jokes is the time to counter their attack or must be risked in times of need just all of them are at it honestly I mean if you think about it as there is milk heels so what would the other liquids do I don't know I don't know we didn't lure that that wasn't concepted but up to you what you think the other ones do uh what is this area I seem to have forgotten this map I actually don't remember it the warriors here know the land uh the obligatory okay please be the last song because no more song missions please see if they can find big b we could use this big b all right just marry big b this much at this point I feel love them so much he enjoys crushing skulls of many tortu tortu or humans when you have all I want to have squid ink spaghetti is that because of me be honest time to find out hey oh strony you didn't have shebe you didn't hear shebe's discussion about oh no actually this is one thing that I'm actually genuinely a bit sad about because I stream so much I don't have time to watch everyone's streams and it ups it like it genuinely upsets me like um I raided into mercy yesterday and she was playing oh mario or whatever the name of the game is oh I've never seen it or played it before and um she was like yeah I've been quite adorably but I just feel bad that like I don't have time like just everything like when I popped into ac stream playing that puzzle game obviously shebe's live right now I have terrible news but I don't have shebe uh in my ear right now that you guys can't hear whilst I game and stream and talk at the same time it's just not possible for me I do not remember this map at all I'm like um let's go for it let's see what this maps all about then what is this is this a run through type of thing uh no this is a search what is going on whoa this is pretty what is going on I need to learn to do that protection spell more wait why did the area just moved wait so am I supposed to kill those in the area let's go let's see yeah it's kind of shame that all your streams are overlapping I will say one thing I did ask the girls to push on the first week to stream as much as possible however um some of them are going to settle into streaming um I literally said to them do not even dare stream every single day after this like you will be taking breaks that like I was I've lit and they can all vouch that I told them straight to their faces don't you dare stream every single day the only reason I can do it is because I don't experience burnout the only reason I would not stream is if I am on death's door I'm not even kidding um oh that horse is beating me up they're jumping me wait use the ultimate use the heal heal heal heal my goodness you're so so what am I supposed to do here stop oh I'm gonna need to take these um getting hurt by something um what am I getting hurt by I have no idea right wait why am I just to run around these sectors or just stop it oh there's more of them here I need to heal are you forcing them to take breaks I'm not gonna tell them not to stream because that's not my place to do that but I will be worried if as time goes on like I've noticed one of them are like non-stop streaming but I will always like take their like if they say they're fine I'm not gonna question it I'm not I'm absolutely not gonna question it if they want to stream they can stream but I would be a bit worried like hopefully you're not like overdone you're safe because when I do it it's fine but when others do it hold on a minute I'm getting worried I'm I'm turning in a mother mode like are you okay uh is there something I could help you with is there like a reason behind the scenes why you want to stream everything you know I just want to make sure you're okay baby okay you're my you're my wing you're my wing oh my goodness uh you literally just stopped me from doing that ultimate okay objective perfectly right okay we did it we did it take care of your daughters these uh unironically I've been getting nightmares about my daughters um I had a nightmare that I didn't redirect into one of them and then they wanted to leave violor because of that and I literally put in the message I was like am I real mummy now without her because I'm like I'm literally having nightmares like of like oh no something's not going right or like I've done something wrong are we babies here we go well like uh I managed to get streaming did no streaming detachment anxiety that's not the word is it oh wait am I supposed to go this way um separation anxiety from the reefing um that happened and I don't know if I'm gonna develop it again for a little bit uh plausible but it's happened with the girls where when I go to sleep I get so nervous for them and like I'm worried like something might happen to them and I'm not there to like help them through it or something um but yeah yesterday was weird going after the tulip remarks there was so much time in the day but the good news is I got a lot behind the scenes work done wait follow me uh I may or may not blast into that dialogue and I don't know I'm at his court her Mr. Horsey that was me twat wait what oh fucking spank you today what are you playing at protection where's the other guy I literally just saw him or did I just get them both in the goal I assume I'm gonna score in her too yeah okay this is like an escort mission about everything does she attack or does she not attack no she just stands there and lets me do everything all right and ask you have it and lazy bum lazy bum lazy bum that's right I'm calling you'll be a lazy bum what you're gonna do better oh I love that one hit like fly by I swear in those it wasn't thing in the movies no it definitely is not is she getting attacked no she's fine she is getting attacked can you get there right we can progress to the next one she's on a very caring mama honestly she's got worries I'm like I remember my mom telling me when she had me she used to be a deep sleeper but when I was born she became a late sleeper and I'm like I feel that because I've not had like a really good night's sleep since debut oh before debut I didn't even have a good sleep either and the yap is the best part also in general a really cute thing for now is that they are yapping a lot but not a bad way no I love when the girls yap honestly it's like so nice to listen to like their stories and and the situations have been in they've been in like quite humorous situations um and it's just like fun to hear different people talk from like different walks of life like I know that sounds so freaking weird to say but like um it's just fascinating it just I don't know I just I just find it fascinating I feel like you can also learn a lot from people's stories as well even if it's a humorous story normally there's some sort of like thing or element where they can look back and giggle and be like oh I wouldn't have done that no but like oh wasn't it funny at the time and like you know just little good things I should maybe do a reefling story time where we share stories and it'll be like sure like I would be have to be like a google submission thing and it's like oh share your um share like a memory that makes you embarrassed and like I'll read them out and then I'll share you an embarrassing story of mine um like that kind of stuff I would absolutely love to do I feel like those kind of interactive streams are quite funny and we can all like kind of have a wee giggle at each other also you guys must remind me to brush my teeth at the end of the stream I keep forgetting to brush my teeth for that guy and um we need to do it together for 21 days so we can establish uh our beautiful training uh yes hello rocks village behind village the shards are behind honestly me speaking french rocks behind go got it I don't I've forgotten what behind is derriere village derriereville and then rock is probably just like l rock I think there's not a will stand below or is this a fate is this a fate oh it's a fate it's on peer protection I'm literally a warlock peer protection oh we don't like fire fire bad oh get raked get raked get raked I'm getting raked I'm getting raked by the I leveled up though but I'm currently getting absolutely you can literally see the ammo shot that is coming from me from that freaking thing oh unlock new armor whoa I'm naked is that less protection oh no it's the exact same oh if it's the same as the green one yeah we'll just use it um oh my god am I through your reload or something geez get me out of here I'm just gonna run ahead oh I haven't in this as well right we'll do in this try to speak as I say so it's not so literally I was green a minute ago with my armor and then it all disappeared and I'm like excuse me where's my uh protection via armor like you're telling me the navies still haven't figured out that uh maybe we should literally have bullets or getting thrown and you're telling me the navie haven't figured out that we should probably there is much they say you can do uh I can do a shard nearby I'm going to drink a water you should think about hygiene near the east village you must help we were attacked by humans many have died you are not too late go find Alona when he can help and Mercy says uh I'm sorry I've accidentally stumbled into the algorithm on Twitter and I'm like congrats because I don't know how the heck it works either uh and a lot has been used to find all low new in in the village of to the east the red feathers look pretty bad uh where are we going oh a bit of a bit of a walk oh no no not a bit of a walk well because there's a horsey horsey easy bear would you let me read you and say easy there like this dire horse from the hit video game James Cameron's avatar released in 2009 um how many resurrections do I have I've actually not been collecting much samples does that attack me are you friendly oh well that got answered real quick didn't it whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa a bit too much action on these roads for me a bit too much not only I would say my only complaint about this game is that you can never freely explore the land like things constantly keep respawning which I'm not a fan of I quite like the idea of like clearing out an area and then it's like safe every time you like want to come back we're gonna unlock the tree of vision this game well this game did become PlayStation Platinum um uh apparently there's a multiplayer mode in this game I don't ever recall playing that as a child so it's running when is the history stream of yapping about the Irish potato family I was gonna do a teachers day where we have like 40 minute or well maybe 30 minute classes so we do like English study and then we do like a French class and then we'll do like a PE class and we're like literally I'll just instruct you on what we're supposed to do and you'll just hear me jump up and down in my room um um what other we'll do mass as well I'll teach board mass is how we do it in the UK or maybe maybe just Scotland I don't know uh board masses brackets of division multiplication addition subtraction is different what the heck am I supposed to do I wasn't paying attention I think I'm supposed to collect things in this area yes I am I am to collect things in this area if that's the case in viz right now right we'll just do the outskirts of the area because I think that kind of highlights what the daily was where the heck over oh there is right there's one I can hear lots of enemies but I'm trying not to engage in any of them I am gonna get him to not attack me by doing this nope that was not that wasn't it oopsies literally just aggro time on me for no reason oh there is we need one more pink tentacle oh there is there is right we're safe safe safe safe safe we're gonna try and avoid all the fights because you really do once you do like if you engage in all the fights you really do get like tangled up and all this time strongy teaching man and it's not gonna go well but like we would do all the most basic covers like we do biology we'll do physics we'll do chemistry and like a full day and the way I was gonna do it is we're not allowed to progress until you guys actually give me the correct answer so depending on how fast you do it we'll get through the school day like really fast but like I'll put a little I don't know if I can get like a teacher I don't know maybe put like a graduation cap oh wait hold on I just realized I'm not gonna light on that's why my mouth tracking has been all funny hold on hold on professional streamer moment I'm gonna recalibrate just because I keep seeing my mouth is wiggling away I assure you I'm not about to cry you know when someone's about to cry then their mouth starts wiggling that's what I do anyway but we will recalibrate a little tricky a recalibration nope and my blanket is currently trapped around the microphone that's not fair Mr. Blanket please please work with me here your math phobia I hope you have a math phobia numbers oh so I was calibrating so I had to go in the dead silence what you scared the numbers oh multiplication oh yeah that terrify you that stuff made out of nightmares for you yeah where's these horses you could give a history lesson on the battle of bannock born I absolutely will we'll do we'll have a Scottish lessons stream a segment for it because if we're gonna study English later at your name I'm gonna stay off the horse for this I think I'm just picking these people up horse you're in my way thank you reunite the hunters well we'll just I'll just let them fight in the background whilst I'm in a cutscene don't worry guys you're doing fine keep up you know you're fine you're fine you're doing what's your favorite protest what does that mean what's a protest I don't know what I'll make sure alone a win knows you're coming oh my god a veiler group calibration with the math cuz apparently all of you struggle with math literally I like playing in the criminal games but you know I don't actually like doing the thinking part when it comes to numbers so yeah this is the way to victory to victory to victory this is the way to victory and this is a way we'll go I'm actually so fast on this is this faster than the Thanator actually might be you know oh there's so many samples around here I'm just gonna check oh I'm actually max on revives I've got five revives over getting ready to attack you have done much for my class yeah we stand beside you even she be was struggling with a puzzle puzzle games are mmm I asked Emmy and AC see if they would maybe collab on we were here that puzzle game and they had to swap the game they gave it a little shot like just as a five 15-minute practice and they were like we're not playing that and I was that's fine that's fine you don't have to play it's fine fine I wanted to see if I could do it with the refling but then I'd have to like if I could do it yeah they wonder the rock killed me it's sort of flipping entire boulder on my skull are you joking how is that supposed to know that was about time that's outrageous oh map design change what's in here enemies got a lot of oh can you guess really not see okay I give up I give up that's really annoying what's going on here I've done protection I've got knocked back I hate when they knock you back because that's when you can just absolutely eat all of the damage that they're laying out which is not good yeah like I'm literally getting so injured this your spawn point is it behind here you suck give me that spawn point get that spawn point out here oh we're just like literally going back could you do a lesson on Mary Kunis cause honestly oh my god I have to make you do force the force Pete are you religious education as well actually maybe not I may not be that fun for people I'll make us sing a song though a little don't carry anything down the dusty road something like that force choir I'll have to get us all to sing at the same time but it has to be it has to be like internet culture songs because why are we why did why did he just oh there's a dog there but a dog dog with a book and I don't know what songs I could make sing it would have to be related to meme culture what did you guys think about all the songs that made the girls sing I freaking how am I supposed to avoid that I'm sorry there's absolutely no way you can dodge that unless you went to attack but if you am I am I going the wrong way I've gone horrifically the wrong way sorry I had to like really think there I think I'm actually about to lose my dire horse coming back here because of this car yeah wow literally Brian what if the game show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a different subject eyes hold on I'm getting absolutely right hold on protection in viz let's go oh and viz sorry right hold on narrow thank you for the tip hey shroney what if veal or game show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a different I'm sorry I can't do two things at once hold on hold on what way did I go stick to this one oh oh oh I'm no I'm no I'm no smart enough to do two things at once I'm gonna have to read that all over again one more time take it from the top hey strong why is there more enemies what if veal or game show with the girls where they stream the question there are different there the great questions are every so we do have one game show coming up that I'm gonna make I am going to reach out to a creator for possibly they already do a game show but I was gonna set it up for them so literally they can just rack in all the money if you didn't know the easiest way to collab with people is to do all the work but let them like take over type thing it's the most likely way that a collab opportunities will be accepted so I've got possibly a game show we're going to show up on someone else's channel and and then I'll get like a highlight reel made and so I need to reach out to another creator but I'm letting this first week settle down like it's been a bit hectic like trying to get a script manager in place and we're trying to deal with this clipping issue that we've kind of right now things are a bit slow to be produced but the girls are going to have shorts that come out consistently on their channels at some point but like me and she be are literally lagging for shorts because I'm waiting to get us monetized first before we start putting shorts out because this is just a fact but shorts do better if there's something in them that's a bit humorous in that way and the one that I got a she be to do that a fauna speedrun challenge like that did well and all and I actually really she got to show off her mine like voice which is absolutely perfect but the other ones I actually got her to discuss milk body type v-tubers which I thought was super interesting but I'm too scared to put it up right now because I would be mortified if the girls didn't get accepted for monetization and this recent ASMR stuff geez I'm literally getting grenade launched my goodness draw destroy the amp soup well okay I'm gonna say where is it um but there will be a lot of shorts coming up like one monetization is freaking dealt with uh because the stats updated but it only updated halfway through debut so it says I still haven't reached watch hours even though I think I have like a stupendous amount of watch hours now especially after that assassins creed my assassins creed brother you'd stream almost has more views than my debut stream which is hilarious to think about because I streamed for so long and I guess people just didn't expect it so like they came back in the stream twice at some point you made 20 hours in two days literally like but after debut we all successfully had enough watch time at that point it's just youtube has taken an entire week to update and today I was supposed to be able to apply everyone's channel for monetization but it only partially updated the thing I think it's faster if I jump no just jump down on this bridge that comes up um but I only did it halfway through debut so I need to wait another 24 hours for it to update and then I can submit all the girls channels um like I've got an ASMR short of sheebie as well but Azura's short got denied for monetization for advertisement and I think it's literally because her voice is just too strong like I don't know how but her her voice is too strong it needs nerve oh I really don't want to go down if that's there can I destroy this hold on did I just snipe him out of that car did that car just disappear I'm just gonna invis through this section but that looks like I sniked him out that car no I clearly didn't because he's right there you don't hear anything that's called the AI cheating what's this a bomb ooh a bomb ooh a bomb whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa there's far too many of you right now there's far too many of you right now oh my gosh oh my gosh I've done it now I've done it now I've done it now I've done now commit commit commit commit submit conceptguitar where's the one where's the one just one more in here there is a siya siya siya siya we can do this we can do this as long as I do I do it I'll hit checkpoint right get me that head out here ooh I don't have heal yet I don't have I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal. What's going on? Why? Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, get on the horse, get on the horse, get on the horse, get on the horse. Am I on the wrong side? If I go this way, I can teleport to that other one and then go from there. Yes, we will do that. Oh no, there's another one of these. Oh my gosh, they're so pee. Goodness gravy. What does that even mean? How, literally, I think it's because very sadly sheepsters in Azura might have a cover up for their, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, we're kind of, we're at the question mark stage of what's the problem, what's the issue, but we'll get there, okay. Did I say thank you for the tip, Nero? Sorry if I didn't. But yes, there are game show type-esque things coming up, there's no horse games. November is my Scottish game show, I don't know if one of the girls might be interested in holding a type of VTuber collab game show, I'll need to see, mate, I was actually helping you, do you mind? Jeez, you're so rude and stinky. Alright, I think I'm to go this way and then, I'm sorry, I'm getting really switched around with this freaking map, but we'll just, we'll go for it, we'll send it. Ooh, no thank you, no thank you, no thank you, hehehe, not interested, no thank you. Your horses butt is soaking up all those bullets like a cha- honestly, stagger an amount of endurance on that thing. The Easter wheels, oh, are they finally giving me a path with no enemies? You know what, I'm not speaking ever again, that's a ridiculous timing, you've embarrassed me. I would, I think that's my only complaint about this game, it would be so nice if there was areas that you could just enjoy for the beauty, which I know this sounds like such a weird thing to say, but like, I really, I like admiring the game, okay? I'm a little, a little map design admirer and like look at how much nature there is. I'm pretty sure there's actually a steam game that came out and it's all about identifying plants in nature and I'm like, honestly, I wish I was like more entertaining so I could play it, but I'm not that entertaining, B or B, I gotta go somewhere, okay let me just pause the stream, we'll wait for you to come back, see you when you come back. Oh, it's not Osha, is it Peeta, P-E-T-A, Peeta, that's that animal organisation, Peeta, Peeta, that's not working in my head, I don't think it's Peeta. Oh, new armour, oh, check that out, oh I like that, hold on, let's do a little wardrobe check, wardrobe check, oh wait, whoa. My mobility is way down, but my protection is so up from that, we might leave that up, I'd rather like have more indefinite protection than having to deal with all these issues, with constantly like getting barraged. Ah, right, okay, crystal, crystal, crystal, crystal, let's beat them up, where's the crystal? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, steady on, steady on, where's the crystal, I'm like literally jump-scaring these guys, whoa, you were on the crystal, alright, where is it, am I staring at it, oh it's up, oh wow, okay, I wouldn't have known that, it's like I was on that crystal there, mission complete, wee, ow, my ankles, no again, protection is more important, the mobility, I would say so yeah, that's a big old horse ride, um, can I, wait is that, that is done, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, just reading them up, yeah, I don't know where to go, I don't know where to go, I don't know, really turned around, I think it would be faster if I took a teleport near this location, um, hello, uh, I have to redo the set, alright, okay, no, I just fell through the map, okay, classic open, but there we go, I think we're actually getting pretty close, I have never done that before, I guess this game, I mean I did say that games have problems with vertical stuff, especially older games, when it comes to mapping you just fall through the map so many times in older games, right, we're gonna teleport where, it looks like that and then just take a weird straight ahead, what a strange layout for a map, a skill issue honestly, childhood me would never do that, and yet here we are being an even worse gamer, pardon me, I'm doing this with baby birds this time, I saw the truck, I saw it, wait I need to claim this, I don't know, oh my, I don't know if I'm, can I get away with this, oh my god I can get away with it, oh, oh that poor horse I've just left it, I'm so sorry you get to meet Ewa now, hush hush, your plight is over, you no longer have to, you can frolic in the fields in Ewa's heaven now, if I've just left you, to perish to the RDA, ooh, I would make the joke but I don't have any more sound effects, magic your way to the other side of the map honestly, a bit cheeky to claim when there's an entire tank shooting at you, you're the best gamer I am especially when you rage, oh no, I always feel bad when I rage because I feel like it's like, I like doing what I like to see and if I see like a streamer rage I'm like, I'm not sure I'm finding this entertaining but if you guys like it then sure I'll tap into my ancestors rage, I'm literally the, is it the orcs and Skyrim, I think their special move is called Ancestral's Rage and it's like 10% more, or Berserk type thing, it's like 10% more damage, what's going on here, the last song, right, look for the thumping when bumping, nope, there's a fight, why is there a fight, I thought I just had to interact with the tree, did I not have to interact with the tree, oh, okay, okay, okay, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, come on, let's do it before they destroy absolutely everything, is it not here, triangle, hello triangle, looking for a triangle, triangle, this is a triangle, there we go, are they going to blow the tree up before I get the phone, no the Ancestral stuff was done more, Berserkers rage is the one that works out, ah, right, invisible because we're not out here trying to have a billion battles every two seconds, yeah, probably feedback on the game, kind of calm down on how many enemies you put on the map because they are constant, hello barrier, did this, did this game really say go around, no way this game just said go around, oh no it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, yes, yes, let's get out of here, this place is gonna blow, oh, we must return to Kellotron, take your ecran, we ride to home tree, okay, we go to home tree, home tree, I think we're getting there, I can't really recall how much more to the campaign there is, this would be three songs and if we're playing the classic video game rule, I can't remember what comes after the third song, I swear if it's like go for another song on my right, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up, you're taking a bit too long now, take a bit too long, we're gonna need to do something a bit more than home questing, but look how cool that armor looks honestly, that's pretty thick, it would be so cool to see this game remastered, but I do not think it sold well, I think it hardly did it, it's numeros, hello, we love them, James Cameron you did it again, is it snowing, no, let's hope we're getting close, we don't find it soon, this whole planet's gonna fly, winter in Australia is just fake, it never goes below freezing, yes yes the song, the song, ay was song, please be the last song, no more singing, ah ah ah ah ah, tells where it is, please, no more songs, surely we know what's up, many of the people believe in you yet some fear the tattooed spirit inside you let me get fedama he blames you for much there was just a whole missing voice line i think it was so hard to come to our realization that christmas is summer final song it's not natural but it's a pretty decided once i wrap up a business that i am going back to yeah if you ever went to open up a business in the uk don't you better do it in australia but then go back to the uk once you're done with all your business yeah here for more entrepreneur tips like and subscribe tanjala wants you to fly to a new location i don't know what this i'm afraid my memory is getting very easy now for the game you'd kill for a warm christmas it is bizarre i did not enjoy it like i phoned my family and i was like oh i wish it was cold i wish it was cold um because you do get snowy christmas in scotland which is really pretty when it does happen when the stars align it's very nice hello hello i haven't given up where is the shot where sky machine has crushed you are so mean i've literally been helping you for ages i'm sorry but i think enough time to pass where he should be all right with me and you're giving me any nonsense you make it sound so mystical it's very beautiful where the what the heck is this map i do not recall at all memories getting a little bit easy i can't see where the map ends because of that very top right corner very clearly that's where this map location ends but i don't know what happens here i can't believe it right i think we're just gonna leg it as we always do but yeah like these look the map details like the kind of the further you progress the more damage the areas are and you know it was trying our hardest but like there's only only so much awa can do and the navi can do against literal bullets i have to admit bows versus bullets like i'd rather have the rather have the mp5 or the famine so my wait why did i get off i just want to activate that oh well i needed to get off anyway because i need to cut up in this fence i'm itching my little whoa is this elden ring oh you've got this right let's see uh we'll just avoid thank you for spawning in but not really interested me wait am i going the wrong way no i can go this way i just happened to walk right into an rda uh aligned and i need to cut this fence as well goodness gravy i might make a cup of tea shortly and go for a peep because we've actually not peeped in three and a half hours of uh unless some of you guys have a detached headset and then you go for a peep whilst whilst still listening to oh the fact that there's a very high chance that a reefling has dropped a loaf of bread while listening to me ramble on stream that's right reefling i'm on air i know exactly what you're up to mm-hmm i know what's going on a drop a loaf of bread honestly drop apparently the there's another same which is a drop the kids off at the pool which is a guilty is charged oh no it's been confirmed you know when people say like oh what did you what what did you think would happen like when you became a vertebra etc uh apparently i didn't account for someone dropping a loaf of bread to my voice so there's that yeah um yeah quite a few unique scenarios definitely definitely how are you ever like he teleports around this map for fun i swear okay hello no the shard was blown up not sure not sure the first voice is not sure oh i'm being called the first voice i'm no longer dreamwalker oh my tummy rumbled if you heard that listen into your patreon audio we'll see in a man about horse i didn't want to miss the second of your beautiful voice though if it's any consolation you make dropping and you make dropping a loaf of bread hell a lot more comfortable you're done you're out out you're done we would be not identifying as loaf of bread droppers oh that came out nowhere oh my poor horse i should have picked up a new one because he's so low health i want him to retire and live a happy life but i don't think that's gonna is a left or right it's this way she knows too much hey yeah oh right i'm gonna pick up this horse here because i would like this one to literally retire and have a happy life excuse me mr. horsey see you go enjoy yourself and heal up and then i'm gonna have you and then everyone lived happily ever after and the and everyone around me clapped yay hey that's what we're supposed to listen to the first honestly though um wow that's a lot of power about a lot of manpower behind that they're destroying the crystals before we get them is someone telling them this how do they know where the heck all these crystals are right we'll finish this map and then we'll go for a tinkle and i will also go for a tinkle and make a cup of honey tea to help soothe my curve voice it's really bizarre my voice is so broken but the microphone makes it sound so like fine and not broke wait can i just teleport no um so i sound like pretty normal on stream my voice has been broken since uh the the violor exposed violor stream um i don't know thankfully i've managed to record a lot of stuff in advance but don't be surprised if you get a patreon audio and i'm just sound like a frog i'm like yeah you like that good boy and you're such a good wee boy and you like my toad boy like it's getting it's getting curious it's getting curious and you are a demon how is it you live honestly that's kind of a fair assumption there's something i gotta tell you we must have been those who have fallen do some patreon videos in full pantomime you get 3d models and start like mime in the axe yeah wouldn't be the first thing patreon looks and audio in me a little frog voice moment you let a horse die oh it was a mistake i can't save them all but i can try my best also i just want to say i am still getting marshmallows of people asking me to save each oh that horse literally just perished right before me oh where am i supposed to go uh that's quite far to go by foot but we don't really have a choice there's no more horsey boysy um skull horse skull women sound really cute when their voice is cracked and squeak from over use and they're giggling asking you to say what no they're they're asking me to save certain v-tubers and i said it on that stream the other day and like we're all having a giggle but i woke up and i got a few more and i'm like i don't i don't know if it's reef link sending it or whatever but like i'm gonna be on it oh it's full health again um i'm gonna be honest uh i hope it's understandable no i can't literally save all v-tubers you know i'll try my best to look after those who have faith in me um you know i'm a big believer in reciprocation in terms of you have faith in me i have faith in you type thing oh well i better not am i on a timer and i don't know it i think i'm on a timer gotta go gotta go gotta go i know i know i know i know i'm trying i can unlock this uh tree of vision you can leave from the front and try and change i think the content creator owned agencies definitely have a place um definitely have a place um because i think people are a bit it's not for me to say what the the overall feel is but i think for me anyway it was very disappointing to learn how little creators that sign up for these agencies get in exchange for all their hard work because did he just go ahead me powerful then a river did he just go ahead me um hello hello human resources do you guys have human resources on pandora because um what was that excuse me uh yeah because we have very specific unlikely but um i did actually learn about another agency that did have a higher split than the 5050 which i'm i'm quite happy to hear about um so i think hopefully over time that 5050 split uh gets raised because i will tell you right now for however hard the girls work on stream it's absolutely nothing to do with me i don't tell them what to do they do it all themselves um and i believe that they should take home the lion's share that's just me but not every agency out there feels like that um but if you value um if you genuinely like as a special thank you is what wait hold on i'm getting absolutely annihilated here do i need to take these down i think so hold on i'm doing i cast protection what's going on here am i just to destroy because i'll do it ow we're on the same team right i don't have protection anymore but uh okay okay we're to just kill i can do that i can do that we but i'm a weapon what's this is this and can i not know uh whoa whoa whoa you're not agro to me hey hey yay yay yay yay we're helping a while we're helping helping you know what helping is yeah these guys these are the best are they spawning oh my game just froze there did you see that i don't know if that was calling stream or not but that was for me and i thought i can hear bullets from over here so we check out okay let's go oh one more one more mission oh here here spawned a navi resources the world would be a beautiful place if you're more like me the only the only problem is uh you never know if someone wants to take like advantage of you but i i got very lucky in all my pics of the girls and none of them have given any indication such things we got the crimson yeah froze i saw that monk is monk is monk is please don't please don't crash please don't crash please don't crash and yes i've um i've always been described as naive like my entire life um and i like i'm used to it and i i do have to agree i do have to agree um but the the good news is it can lead to such such crazy experiences you know like i could have easily like have just never bothered about any of it and just you know get the resources to myself all that kind of thing but um i'm passionate about helping people achieve their dreams and you know i've already kind of achieved everything that i kind of wanted to do in terms of like successful content creator and to give people that experience that kind of thing just like that that's the new goal you know that's the new goal like as but like yeah yeah you know life life's good life is beautiful um and you know if you don't try out these things at least you know at the end of this at the end of everything like well i mean wrap it up wrap it up wrap it up come on wrap it up at the end of everything at least i can say yeah heck yeah i went for it i did it um and wow what an achievement you know what uh what an experience as well like an insane life experience uh just to even be in the position to make any of this happen and it's just lovely lovely job right i just saved you you better be nice to me now only a demon should carry such luck you still don't like me gather your soul let no more of my warriors you still don't like me you're joking you are joking me it's funny how it'd be an inspiration right now on a thursday afternoon you're doing great dumb dumb but try to also think of your health oh i've been good i have my health has uh just been uh has been going up and up and up what the humans know what we're doing they destroyed the show this you said us to die for nothing no i think i can still do this you will die human i can do this what am i going to commune without the shards a while loves me sorry i'm a was little teacher's pet right now i'm not even kidding i'm floating no i'm not sorry that was the camera angle i thought that was levitation i was just the camera angle my apologies got a little excited there uh got a little uh head of myself that was a cheeky little camera angle moment you must return the song to tahi tsunami wait you spoke as the first voice all of a sudden he's been nice to me i would not hear one day i will repay you for all is it because he saw me commune with awa that he's nice to me now if we're still alive after today beers are on you if that is what it takes he doesn't even know what beer is do they even know what fermentation is humans will soon are you telling me the navi gets steaming every weekend i'd believe it honestly i'd get a steaming with the navi not gonna lie i'd like ask them to carry me around on their backs and stuff he was we discord kitten honestly he's not a hater anymore literally he was just a bit stressed from all the war just a wee bit of war wee bit of war you know strong men more times you know how it goes you know everyone needs a bit of release if you know and then it's just what happens just what happens oh my god do you approve of me now you think the first thing the humans gave to the navi we're making friends with beer honestly oh here's a bit diazepam you just get hooked on that uh cause a little uh drug pandemic you know here we go the humans gather do you have the final song oh wait are we at the end i think so something happened are we at the end of the game already i don't know why i'm like 19 percent sure if you look up how long does james Cameron's avatar take it said literally eight hours to understand now quickly um sing the final song oh but that's like such a short screen though i never thought this far ahead i thought it was gonna be like an eight hour day i suppose the only good side if it was a short stream i can work on my asmr then because i've got collapse with five other girls that i'm working on outside of yellow yeah you can always yeah uh yeah we can do some marshmallows after the game wait am i seriously i was going to make a cup of tea and peeping all of that wait i think that's super about to do the last level only first voice can awaken the well of source okay and how am i supposed to do that oh so many questions trust himself now rda play through for more time no i refuse i refuse rda like open your mouth rda players that's what i think of your rda players any percent speed run honestly i feel like we're about to play the last game like the last level human you're so tiny oh you're so tiny human human human you are so tiny hello writer look at you you really look full naughty now what are you doing here it's falco he's found the location of the dormant site i know you have to move fast falco sent a dragon to the site he's gonna drop the emulator on the well of souls this is the last mission what the heck you need the true first we're not even on the forever mark of gameplay yeah about that looks like it's me the eight hours i must be four yeah i was gonna say it must be four hours navi four hours rda i'll take care of this kendra i gotta find tangyala wow i didn't know i expect that at all oh i was like strapped in for a good long though i'll say one thing the only good thing if i do go offline earlier is i can read into another viewer member and i can get to work on those asmr scripts because their girls uh that i'm collabing with are waiting on me are you squidding me right now brian big big please play the rda with money on top you can't give me money and ask for it because then i feel like i do have to do it partner it's still me if we play the rda sage you all have to call me a good girl okay what about tantis thank you for the tip iron refer that's crazy to put that money behind that door oh i've never played it before hmm right we'll finish the navi sides and then you are a good girl you're the best i just got home from work no 12 hour stream today well we might do a lock in for another four hours if we play the rda side but i get really scared because the rda side you're so small on the camera so small and the navi are so big and scary i can't promise i'm not going to be scared because i've never done it before i don't know what comes up but like with these ones like my kind of remember what comes out it's a good girl it's a good girl yes you're astralia best girl we got a work right right let's unlock the classic tree of vision momento thank you hmm head pads and scritches um my freaking tags aren't working on my alternative twitter i'm trying to retweet all the like things i get in for a fight here or what we must attack the commanders put their forces in disarray grunts will not know what to do you're such a good girl how the hell do you know something about me oh she girl also all the plants and animals attack you and rda no i'm so scared i'm scared already um we share this battle like i'm actually going to be scared i'm not even kidding hopefully my abilities keep me alive when we do the rda side but oh i'm like genuinely dreading that i don't know if you can tell many boom you're gonna hold my hand through it yeah you better i just know there's going to be a hypnosis mark i actually know i didn't ask secret subject i'm very very busy maybe i should just get the balls to do that enough what is this map i do not recall hmm right we'll go grab a horror horse let's go and then we'll see where that takes us i said it was gonna be should we should we pause for a tinkle and a cup of tea then possibly wait i need to go left or right and you follow the path clearly burning the countryside literally be careful because that plant will accidentally uh team oh my goodness i hope i've got good armor this is crazy thank god they're not looking onto the horse wow this is getting quite a lot what we're

my healing ability ragdolled honestly the mission even if secret is punching humans punching me honestly if you if you try and dissect the gameplay a little too much you might find yourself a little a little underwhelmed it may be a little lackluster but uh this one oh don't wait wait wait then you worry about it right then you worry about it you're all destroyed Savoy and his demons oh demon skin i like the description for America i'm currently in my demon skin how do you do fellow demon skin enthusiasts take your banshee and ride it oh have i done it awake well of souls i think this is a a gasped and my throat made a noise i'm sorry if you heard that i don't mean it oh level up rathmore oh my god new armor i saw it i saw it i have a skull on my head oh hey i almost forgot this game because congrats you're the second person to play this game uh that even knows about this game because one person said they played it earlier and then now you've said you played it so now all three of us who have ever played this game are now here because literally no one has played this game does anyone i wonder if there's a public record of how many copies were sold because i just feel like it's such a thing way too late for this stream but i'm also one of the two people i played yeah uh everyone thinks i'm playing the new avatar i think possibly i don't know actually i don't know what the new avatar games called because this one's called james cameron's avatar the game well we've got to say oh my god mansion armor to winzies go waits for me in the in the cavern okay to the cat to the cavern to the cavern or something's waiting for me waiting waiting waiting cavern right i'm about to go around okay i'm to go around my apologies this the game has an interest in story i like it basically you are human and then it turns out a war planned on you kind of i don't know it's really bizarre oh a scalp the perimeter comb that beach why is that phrase called comb a beach what's that you mean what does it mean what does it even translate to am i going the wrong way i'm getting nervous i'm going to they can literally hear me like jump a boot i hear them oh my going to make it is in this oh i almost made it past all those rda soldiers i'll take it i'll take it a couple paths yeah i assume when we play the rda side we're literally just playing the exact same maps but doing the opposite of the bad people and destroying everything wow i need prediction on right now i'm getting absolutely nailed them right now i don't want to use healing because i actually do a full health bar when i heal let's uh let's speed on speed on through okay this looks more navvy oriented four hours is it going to be another endurance stream i think so originally it wasn't but um um i got paid money to play the rda side and you guys are holding my hand through it because i am genuinely afraid of what happens hello how do you do i'll hope lies with you dreamwalkers excuse me i'm actually called the first voice i'm no longer i didn't i don't respond to dreamwalker i'm the first boy will not let them any first voicers has asked you to kill rda forces yeah so emmy is going live youtube moderators i grant the permission to link a sheet stream it is mine it's unarchived okay smart and mckels smart smart embers uh this looks like it's uh destroy everything mission because there's a timer oh right there is actually a timer on the day i don't know if any protection spell yet i'll wait until i'm getting whacked i don't i'm not experiencing the whacking yet uh i'm gone right okay i think the game's actually getting mildly oh my god imagine three navvy ganging up on you it's over it's over i wouldn't even bother just put the gun down and be like uh actually i'm gonna be one of you oh wait hold it sorry i'm getting distracted protection i've casted protection okay there we go gang violence gang violence we're literally ganging up in the fur guy oh that's terrible absolutely a wipe in the night i guess one for you one spank for you and one for you okay we just need to defend the village now without perishing which i can definitely i can hear someone getting hurt over here oh yeah one for the true warfare i think we're cheering each other on we responsible i was just okay i'm gonna need that prayer to pop again because now there's mecha getting involved demon skin parish but yes uh emmy bezu uh the beloved hex maniacal dealer is live right now you are welcome to jump into her stream and uh make sure you're you know make sure your little sister stays in check don't want any issues wink wink uh imagine assassin's speed but planer's attempt yeah that's what i'm kind of like why on earth would anyone want to do the rda but like money talks dirty cash i want you dirty cash i want you oh money talking money talking stupid oh um oh camera angle steady steady right we've got one more minute isn't that a game already what game are you partly viewing about identify your topic of conversation one two three four five ultimate yeah honestly that ultimate is actually pretty sad so i'm gonna heal because it's not gonna all heal when we're not around it because the enemies keep coming back so protection oh there's a mech over there i think oh it's out of bounds wow i just do this for now oh no no i won't somebody's getting me oh maybe not maybe not the navi are actually helping hold on ai that actually attacks the enemies that are around you hold on a minute this game's 2009 and you're telling me they nailed it here and then games afterwards it's my biggest like great with video game development if you have allies that can attack but they do not actually end the enemies looking at you lego franchise looking at you and they actually don't help at all i don't know if the newest lego star wars they actually do help her is she playing this because she genuinely likes it or is she as a warning to the rest of us avoid this it's my childhood game i do like the game i'm just rubbish at it i i like the navi side i've never played the rda say whoa oh that's so cool looking i think we get to write it that's like such a cool looking dragon such a badass looking dragon and if you wanted to shorten it i guess you could see we're raiding that bad dragon oh thank you thank you i'll be here all week try the veal it's awful i'm so sorry 2009 my child i'm too old for this oh my god we are that was fell it was i apologize that was a good one thanks came up with it on the it probably is the game i completed the most that's much fun should be ashamed of yourself boom dragon dies oh my god look how big its wingspan is oh gorgeous oh beautiful beautiful i love that design that's so cool jen too can we get this color palette or something because that is wicked that oh sorry sorry my bad it's first time riding you hold on hold on there's a saddle on down excuse me thank you very much it'd be nothing i'm not that lovely we're not i heard that that creepy noise oh uh no i'm not jealous i'm ashamed of finding that joke funny eh what is that noise i think that's the where the soul is calling on me first time raiding warning warning raider hardly even nor oh oh wait i don't even get the bidimps for that oh okay sorry i wouldn't i would entertain the idea of uh gen 2 dragon that hordes you like treasure and she calls you like my treasure my value like that kind of angle i like that that's uh that's not bad i would entertain that i'm gonna entertain that oh you have crickets too yeah i would actually entertain that um and for anyone asked fin dom no i don't like it i don't i don't think it's me oh what the jelly what the land jellyfish gonna do huh oh i've completely forgotten what happens in this cutscene if i'm gonna be honest uh uh is that an electricity sound are we about to lighten and bolt this thing out the sky electricity oh thunder and lighten and maybe okay okay question mark okay question mark question mark we're saved though that's the fantastic news first voice does not need a second he really we prepare a storm is in the sky we did it na vi na vi na vi we're the best we're the best better than the rest better than the rda let me take a little little drink too congrats on getting second please for na vi any percent lemo let me submit this stream for it why not another game down well uh we're gonna go for a tinkle winkle and i'm gonna make a honey tea because my voice box is dying and then we're gonna do the rda side so don't uh emmy i believe sheebie is playing class of 09 emmy bezu is doing an unlisted unarchived stream so please don't be afraid to go check that out because i'll still be here actually i don't know how long she's gonna go for that maybe i mean if it's four hours to do the rda side it is very rough on the voice to whisper for four hours so hopefully i know boo rda rda hate emmy is making pin pals do math oh no way i think to know if you play as a human you have multiple places where you can betray them hmm what is that like all the way up to the very end because wouldn't i wouldn't i just become a na vi at that point or am i still human you wouldn't i have to do the evil side now unfortunately i think i would ruin the run if i did it i beat the game already literally i think it's four hours for each side yeah there's emmy rda hate but gun and flamethrower fun though then every straight up ask you to switch like three four times oh do they i would know i love gun shoot so i right i'm gonna quickly go peep um and make a cup of tea i highly suggest everyone to stretch your legs don't be afraid to open up any stream the now um i will be roughly three minutes it takes me like three minutes to boil the kettle and tinkle and all of that so please do do fish pee absolutely fish pee all over you right now um please don't be afraid to check out sheebie or emmy um i will be a couple of minutes and then we will jump back into the naughty naughty human side bad human bad human stinky human stinky stinky um but yes please do consider standing up stretching your legs getting yourself a little snacky wacky um and then we'll jump in and you guys have to hold my hands with the game because i am actually genuinely terrified to please swim in all the way through because camera angle is so freaking low to the ground and if i've got big navi running at me i'm actually gonna be scared so yes hopefully this doesn't work i really hope the game doesn't break well i'm gonna wait for like literally three minutes but the game's so old right please do stand up and get some rest okay i need to do this did it work did it work oh yeah okay i go now so I don't know what's going on here, but I don't know what's going on here, but I don't know

What do you get when you cross a snowman and a vampire? Why was that so delayed? I don't know why the crickets were so delayed. That was even more embarrassing. That made it worse that the crickets were delayed. All right, you ready for this we're skipping we're skipping Even the crickets aren't having it literally even showing up Eight hours built on the shorter side I'll let you like I've kind of mentioned I weave it, but like going offline after two hours I like sat and was just staring at the screen for a little bit. I was like What do I do now like I've got like an entire day, and I'm not on stream like it felt so weird Like I don't But I reached them a smart collapse type thing, which is really good Our little cheekies are definitely red reporting for duty, sir I think I'm too German for the jokes are the bad they are terrible the jokes are not funny and That is why we we use the Cuz no one's laughing at the joke Honestly it felt weird like I'll every week I do plan in a couple of injured streams But the days that have shorter streams like the two are one like I really enjoyed needy streamer overload I did not expect to enjoy that. I looked up the Ending I would have gotten if I managed to not ignore her and Like she was like ready to become a god and like take down 10% of the world's population and all that and I'm like whoa I so wish I could have gotten that but I messed up too badly, but that's okay. I couldn't have known you know played for the same You know you get none of the squat you go you and none of the squad laughing with that one I giggle You're still sitting on your feet. I am I'm sitting on my right one right now And then the left one is just wiggling the back of the chair. Why do you want to go? Don't abuse What do you say? Niko from undead and what I don't know Think of criss-cross applesauce the way you sit like that, but I'm sitting on my foot like against my Honestly good way to really enjoy streams of you because I constantly like wiggle and move my legs type thing I They're putting pressure on moving them like cuz cuz I'm sitting on my foot. There's pressure against it So it's like keeping the station You get a little ground out of us a little mouth curve Oh, yeah, did I have the ability to make you put air out your nose a little just a little bit faster? Yeah, I'm thinking Crouched no, I'm not I'm not crouching. I'm like sitting on them this time But I do go on crouch on the chair sometimes Like I was having to send all I was talking to like eight people at once trying to organize something for the girls And I was golem crouched on my chair Because I was trying to like get it done so fast so I could go to bed because I was exhausted I'm like trying to like send this to an editor and upload these files over here and send them off and get the link and make sure It's a pretty like oh so Yeah Although they attacked me when I'm Navi as well, so honestly just a wee bit deserve Oh These things are indestructible honestly Should unplug my mouse and keyboard right now just looking I'm not even paying attention honestly, I should but I Think you could probably xp farm here if you had the tolerance for it because you're getting 50 every time and my It says I need 1600 xp to level up So yeah, that's the pretty big xp form Ow my angst You're like I got paid to side with the humans. Okay, I got this is Not me. I'll put a little disclaimer at the top of the screen. Not me You're not funny, but your accent is doing the heavy lifting Fucking hell, you're not supposed to say that part out loud.

Oh, can you like see the music video in your head as I'm talking about it? Can I put images in your head if I talk about things? Oh my god, I never even spoke about that So I can't like see things in my head the way others can like the way it's just like I can't do that So if I say things does it appear in your head? Ah Sometimes okay, okay, I'm totally not gonna use that Against you at any point Can I do a music videos I am now making you think of The gorillas music video where noodles is dancing in that room and then the guy Has a big head and it goes never did no harm never did no harm Wait, it's all the wrong one, I don't know one of them the giant head literally it was just a man I saw the comments and someone was like that a key Joe Honestly his jaw. So, um, if you ever take the recreational and also known as bebex to say and That makes your jaw clench or something along that line and so In scott's you say like all his jaw was spinning or like he's got an achy jaw and And Like the comments were all saying that and we'll watch it back and I was like, oh, wow Oh, excuse me.

I Can call in a motor strike hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. This is actually maybe I admit It's a little bit cool. I'll definitely keep zoom because it keeps me away significantly increased damage Oh, but that one's Calling an airstrike destroying every enemy and be aware it takes a few seconds for the strike to arrive Maybe just defense I think defense speed and health to get me out of there and whatever the last one was Invisibility and zoom get me out of whatever situation I'm in the video with Jack black Yeah, yeah, so I'm about to go full fortune it's on the nappy. I don't know what fortune this one is but Hot hot take coming in. Oh, I don't like the gorillas. Oh, yeah, that's okay. You don't have to like everything Some things are for some people and some things aren't for some people that is how the world work I don't think anyone should be punished. However, if you don't like Assassin's Creed brotherhood, then I will happily Put you in either Mercy's basement or she bees Dungeon take your pick, you know up to you Um Right, we are just skipping through this for those of you have kind of just joined in you're not quite sure what's going on Um, we have successfully finished the nappy side of this game We are now purposely joining the RDA, which I have never actually played before but we are still in the tutorial section So I know what comes up ahead like it's not a big deal or anything like that and I Prepare a paranoid myself You're always a good girl. Whoa Hold on a minute, why am I getting praised out nowhere? What are they? Oh, what do I do? Oh, what do I do? Not everything know everything but no humor Remain just noisy. Whoa, where's the print?

Jeez. Lois. Talk about being unfriendly around these part Make her blush for every bad joke of today's stream. Honestly, it's been pretty rough Right if I remember correctly, there's literally Yeah, um, okay. I've just noticed that we have infinite ammo on this gun One that's not how they work to Actually, it's a wee bit of a pet peeve the one all we should watch those Keanu Reeve movies because they have the ammo reload thing, correct And how am I trying to say it like in movies where they just like With a pistol and like pistol literally have seven max like if you're talking like the M7 or something like that Why where the enemies I can hear them. Oh Well, I did ask to see them and I can see them loud and clear Jeez the camp. I'm stuck on something. Oh Jesus, I need I need some space. I need some space in order to like actually shoot please game If you're not gonna give me aim assist at least let me fricking shoot They sound like buzzle gum from Viva Pinata, it's almost like they're based after flies Why Johnson the Baba Yaga Wic. Yes, that one we should watch those because I like how they're actually accurate with the goons It's very nice that they're accurate with the reading. I love the way John Wic uses reloads to set the case for gun face I don't know you'll notice that that's true Unlimited ammo and mass effect Someone said I might like mass effect I've actually never played the series before but some said I might like it. I Know he's called Sheppard That's about it. Oh, no, I don't need to do that at all. I'm getting confused All the John Wick movies are good. Yeah, speaking of John Wick. Have you played cyberpunk? No, I haven't I watch Shia cyberpunk but I am I am still absolutely heartbroken about Rebecca. I am so sorry. Is it Her name is Rebecca. What's the name of the? The cyber You're over the rainbow here. Is it Lucy? Is it Rebecca and Lucy like brotherhood? I'm getting brotherhood. That's awesome screw brother. Wait, it is Rebecca and Lucy What are the odds that assassin creep brotherhood and cyberpunk the anime I Am I am heartbroken over Rebecca? I'm so sorry. I'm gonna see something so controversial I have no comprehension no Comprehension on how Rebecca just doesn't auto win like people like all this see this Lucy Lucy are you can you open your eyes and look at how perfect Rebecca is? I'll actually tell you some more development notes and You don't have Rebecca's voice And on the concept of I see obviously I see before I see you know applied and all of that We actually were quite happy to give I see to Someone like that may have had a deeper voice because of Rebecca from cyberpunk. So that's a fun Behind-the-scenes and I am not over Rebecca my first Trigger I Actually, I'm interested in potentially cosplaying her for an ace more stream And I think that would be a hoot and holler and I won't show my face I'd not I'm not for that and But I'm happy to do like a Nick down I'm good to sip of my honey tea to see if it's a sip but yeah, I don't know Lucy everyone arguing about Rebecca and Lucy I'm like, how is anyone looking at Lucy Rebecca's just peak like design everything You know, it's a really sad detail if you haven't seen the cyberpunk anime close your ears for about two minutes And after no, no, I need to say this part out loud close your ears for two minutes If you don't want spoilers about cyberpunk the anime the really sad fact is that Rebecca Got an upgrade to her hands after her brother died to the the crazy guy because of the blowback she got from the shotgun She never gets any root ricochet from shotguns anymore after that fact after that scene and it's such a sad fact But yeah, and Anyway, sorry back to the camp back to the actual gameplay I'm just really passionate The cyber cycle. Yeah, so the cyber cycle takes out her brother But in that scene she shoots a shotgun at him and she goes backwards and then after that moment her Her hand upgrades come in like her fisty cuffs and she never experiences recoil when shooting weaponry And it's all because of that incident And it's so sad But her design is just beautiful. Absolutely beautiful Let me drink my tea The recoil so a little background on Rebecca studio trigger was asked to change her because Her design was too lollipop a trigger went now lollipops these Rebecca definitely influenced I see Creation with the hips area and the legs. I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise a peak design. Sorry I Knew from the get-go. I wanted a troupe a tan, which is what Emy was and then I see and It's not true pattern but and but I did want her to have like the thickness of Rebecca basically it is I mean I'm happy to talk about development. I know it's and Like a Zura. We knew we wanted a chocolate and thick. So we've got a goddess and Yeah, we just took it from there. Obviously. Um, sorry, let me finish this to you. Oh Yeah Adam Sandler said you look like a cut of me. Are you wait in the game? I'm pretty sure that's from the game I'm sure I've seen a clip of that game Coming down with the I'll actually tell you some other developmental notes, you know, if I had a lighter voice a me Amie's design and every in lore and everything if I had a lighter voice I Would death will be a I would death will reflect if I had a lighter voice But unfortunately I don't and so, you know, I take like the the big sister look approach Yeah, don't be surprised if it an alternative outfits, so I look a bit more true to myself and I am I suppose I'm a Rebecca. How tall is Rebecca? No, I do it in centimeters. Don't give me freedom units. I can't do freedom units But I guess Rebecca's really very reflective. I think that's probably why I'm gravitated towards her so much as well Because I'm just like hey, like I just love her I'm gonna leave for the night. So here's your bro teeth brushing. Yes. Thank you So I'm gonna burp my tea up if I'm not careful hold on a minute No, I'm just gonna check how far away my my delivery is of my Mac is my cheeky Mac is any any Mac It's still on its way freaking driver at the restaurant always driver at the restaurant It's never drivers picked it up and it's already on its way It's always at the restaurant just hanging about waiting for a second freaking order.

I Suppose like iron brews my example if you don't drink iron brews a kid, you'll never have a taste for it It's so bizarre and flavor It's like that and Japanese natto fermented soybeans is a breakfast thing apparently if you are a back-of-guy gene and You like it's really hard to enjoy natto unless you like force yourself to eat it over a while and then you get used to that Yeah, like it's hard it's hard to get into it. Mmm Remember the old commercial from it made from Gerders It's cheap as heck and that's why we eat it so much I've had peanut butter toast and banana and it's delicious. It's very nice What's iron brews supposed to taste like they advertise it as ginger and bubblegum and it tastes like battery acid that's only explicable Way that you can see what that orange liquid tastes like it's battery acid, but nice Mmm Literally mountain juice is the closest you'll ever get to it That is just not positive.

why are you going to the side I don't know but I'm drinking all horrible she's just really enthusiastic about the wall oh okay little cheeky camera I don't know you're doing that but I hope that's not joy con drift oh that's what I should name the gamer if we ever had a 2.0 model joy con drew with an eye with the joy oh I need a like a wink sound like a whee every time I wink it goes wheezy hello writer you brought actually don't know the let's get start the dialogue still got some time before the emulators up and running the emulator you don't know yet all in good time right now we need to upload that harmonic pop it into the module and let's see what we've got okay sure here we go what's happening now what's all this stuff for doc yes let me explain the knobby have a unique relationship with the plan using a sacred site they're able to link directly with the ecosystem it's how they communicate with the entire so we're searching for something different our research there is another site that can help us sever the knobby community con already has my joy stick place the knobby call the well if we can find this old this is why they aren't letting you name any more car honestly I know as a I'll never live down from the liberal but honestly best name this is where your harmonics come in right we don't know where this dormant site is hi so the harmonic helps you find its location I'm actually enjoying these cutscenes because I've never seen them before we can triangulate the precise location of the dormant well of soul okay now let's see what your first harmonic shows excellent did you notice the red dots no those are supposed to be a cutscene with each harmonic will reduce the number of red dots cutscene cutscene docu will be our well of soul red dots docu you're up for this plan indeed now it's time to check in with commander falco for your next mission okay I've got your next mission on deck officer midori will meet you fever a new area they really didn't recycle any of the map escort you ain't no plumber you'll be good with it and a score oh my god dug it help please please dug it help of love uh we can partner in crime for those tree huggers are crying foul over this emulator all worried about Monroe mentioned that what is this emulator you stay focused on your mission writer you start growing the conscience and you'll end up on the dead end of a knobby spear dismiss okay okay falcon is your travel to fable hmm that's where they made different maps reach when I genuinely assumed it was just gonna be recycled I can't believe it I'm surprised but we've picked up one song so we need two more songs and then I assume the third we destroy it or the navi destroy it before we get it so it's like literally a complete hundred I could flip yeah words and stuff um hello please fly me to the flea ball let's hit the envelope just promise me no power she really said no projectile woman the fever I feel like I'm gonna be even more scared are you disappointed that they didn't reuse assets since you know the RDA period now I'm just a surprise like I just assumed the opposite was going to be the same maps but we're attacking from a different side but just watch yourself out there I'll drop you at the load with midoring I'm being so fuel I'll catch you on the other side well back into the free let's unlock this teleport first and then get assigned or quest from Kendra welcome to the fever you need to link up with our forward units they've got orders to secure your shards be careful these guys are in that's what it was I was I was wondering why the voice sense so familiar kind of sad they put so much effort into it didn't get much traction I think in 2.7 million sales you made your money back though so investors can't feel too bad I think I don't know if like avatar because when the movie came out it was like this big unexpected hit like no one expected it how do I motion sick buggy okay warning for motion sick people oh right here we go first take a right far or maybe to the well go talk to the person however we need to obtain this quest from okay no navi please you guys freak me out to high heavens seriously oh in the plants even when I'm in the buggy oh my okay okay okay it's like lamp posts in that one game oh oh I didn't see it it just came out of nowhere because it's the same color shade okay let's just accept the mission first hello oh I can hear a navi's bow and arrow behind me in this cutscene uh kill the hammerhead before well I do seem to be a level I'm not real quick though can

likely because this is like really uh whoa no I pressed get me on that leaf get me on it okay hold on how long how do I summon the motor strike uh B no what am I trying to achieve it won't let me put down the strike for some reason uh wow I just completely destroyed nothing I'm so good at the game she be she be finished how was class of oh nine schedules have been posted in the discord apparently she I mean it's getting weaker but I'm probably doing something horrifically well let's be honest a grenade launcher sure let's try that okay I missed I missed oh oh no I missed what she be said and I can't I can't back out the game where it's gonna break she be she be raid she's rassy okay well uh I'm not sure what on earth occurred in class of oh nine but as long as you guys had fun that's the main thing uh she was partying like the 1900s you weren't you went to grace geez that was awful that fight I'm I'm to say I'm confused about that fight is an understatement honestly I hope I don't have to do that get flamed for next time I guess don't listen to them is the here I'm telling fibbers are you telling fibbers about my wonderful daughters what's that noise you guys don't want to deal with that that that navi right there no hold on let me reload with some perish in here okay we're both as bad at aiming as each other am I so small he actually can't hit me I'm starting to think that's what's going on hey thanks I owe you and your boys she be streamers funny as heck only came in at the end I don't even know what happened I'm just this here and won't snitch oh okay well for those of you who are comfortably joining in merci modis is going live in t-minus three hours at the moment we are playing a game known as James Cameron's avatar which is childhood game of mine we have finished the navi quest line and now we are playing as the bad guys I am absolutely terrified of genuinely fighting the um the navi um so we are just trying our best to get through the quest line as fast as possible with the least amount of spikes as possible and the game has aged a little bit in terms of like I don't know what they were thinking these camera angles and stuff why does that look like it's gonna wallop down on me as I go past it I saw that I can that is horrific I've not seen that oh there's noises being made oh there's navi standing up okay that's why that's why we're just gonna keep driving to objective and everything's gonna be all right and we're totally not playing horror game simulator at all honestly this is terrifying as a human oh please let me roll you over please don't get back up again oh please mr rocks don't ruin this I don't want to fight the navi they are absolutely horrifying and terrifying to me I'm not oh that car's gonna blow up so I'm probably gonna have to walk on my feet where or what am I supposed to look nope you're friendly and I'm just shooting at you sorry sorry I swapped teams my bad I swapped teams give me a second give me a second what am I shooting at right let's get some oh no that's a granny let's talk about oh oh wow uh that actually landed the grenade landed why why are you not registering the game's age should be a bit she can do no wrong exactly the hair and have been trained well clearly are they is there supposed to be a shard here I don't I think I'm maybe just to help them uh I will destroy feeling I'm confident as soon as I have allies literally I'm having people help me with these fights okay so it's a clear amount mission this car is gonna battle oh oh I sure wish it came sooner oh balance mid-match blue senderman oh that's probably I'm actually terrified of them good grenade honestly I don't even know how that hit I didn't I was even aiming hey scrawny what's going on playing a game called James Cameron's avatar complete the navi side we are now playing the rda which are the naughty naughty bad humans and I am absolutely terrified every time I go against the navi because they are so tall and lanky and scary and their arms are so long and whoa getting shivers just right we've got we need one more crystal from this map and then we can already move on out here thanks for your help you should know that your men didn't die for nothing I'm gonna make sure of that yeah well then don't get killed that'll just piss me off more the man said he's here for the count this game actually looks well made for a movie I don't want to really write that that's literally gonna oh my god but to take all of that on foot with all the navi is terrifying can I repair it you know get like a little bit oh is it stuck okay hold on I don't want to run this guy over so I'm just gonna just need to edge it out excuse me mate excuse me right there we go this thing is gonna explode the moment I encounter a navi I just don't know it okay I'm already right hold on hold on hold on this is not gonna go well I can already see myself perishing and like five seconds flat this is just the camera angle why did they find a light I was not even like explode out just perish well let's not do that again I guess so I have to do this on foot and be absolutely mortified the entire time let me put on the protection spell that was the dumbest thing I've ever seen don't ever do that again where is it protection right so I have speed protection health and blend I can do it I'm big girl I'm already level three on the abilities so they're actually gonna last quite a long time right that's okay that's okay I'm a big girl and this isn't scary to me at all I'm not absolutely terrified and there's not a bit of pee ready to come flying out of me once I get jump scared we're cutting it we're cutting it short we are cutting it short I have to admit this thing's about to unclog okay that's fine it's just plants plants are allowed to expel that thing I don't know what the heck it does I feel like it's gonna slam down on me and I just want to confirm or deny I get eggs pee for destroying plants no way that's so silly I know how to farm now eh right we just need to go in this uncharted territory I'm sure it'll be fine and there's not tons of navi ahead I'll need these don't raid a flaming cart I think it's okay it's okay okay this is gonna last a good cheeky 10 seconds five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 maybe 50 15 20 20 oh oh I've never been happier seeing a human how's it going oh my goodness yeah uh long day yeah just want to okay there's a little fight going on over there uh I'm wondering if I should farm the wildlife I don't know I don't know you're a lifesaver you're a lifesaver a face of maneuvers can't even explode the car that the higher ups the vehicle license oh my god I can't we don't run away from the same thing wait they still go for me even though I'm zoom in I am literally looming please no navi I did say please but I understand wait wait wait there's a tail look for survivors wait looking good cleaning zenos for xp is always a perfect plan yeah I'm thinking maybe if I find a turret I might try level up if that hammerhead taught us anything is that you ain't got enough damage for bosses monkey ass are you implying there's a boss ahead monkey ass because I I don't I don't know stalker's valley oh my god this is where mercy lives okay but it's mercy morning and t-minus less than three hours whoa whoa whoa all right I think so something came out of the jungle big I have to go against the tana or thing hit me I'm gonna have to call for another chopper you rider oh yeah I think you were my ride how can I help I'm fine but you'll have to know I don't know what the hell is out there even navi had bosses like those dudes that took a lot of killing now imagine the reverse what does monkey ass mean it's a twitch emote where you look really stressed out and like oh no this doesn't look good I'm gonna get that I'm gonna go backwards and get this and oh my god why is it such a horror ambience I'm not even being funny like the leaves shaking about the leaves are like so violently shaking about whoa what what what is going on you're getting jumped by a pack of wolves you'll be okay this I cannot wait to get through this and let it be over because this is just this is too much for my little heart I can hardly take a desert guy they perish oh my yeah this is so how am I supposed to achieve anything when oh I'm just standing in plant poison they're spitting bail at me bro I'm sorry I'm gonna need to like literally get a co-op mode right now so you guys can carry me through this you're not even shooting the plant what are you trying to achieve oh forget it we hate nature literally what it seems like there's more soldiers placed everywhere though maybe to help you through it just because they know they made it a bit harder with the plant and the wildlife and the navi ganging up on you at least like when you're navi only a little bit of the wildlife gang up on you and that oh yeah I would definitely need the frickin oh my is that friendly bombs none of those plants spying oh okay okay it's fine kind of fine this is just a slaughterhouse this is absolute chaos chaos with the a ch whoa what got me it made me jump like the opposite way that you were she's low right there's a sloppy a sloppy plant up ahead actually we need to play cameo because these plants remind me of flecks from cameo I don't know either we're just I cannot wait until I get level four um that's out that is outrageous how many plants there are that's insane oh there's a buggy thank goodness there's a buggy oh my god is it going to have better camera angles whatever this is how do I go forward no how do I shoot oh no let's get out sorry wait wait hold on let me let me learn how to shoot let me learn how to shoot is there not like an alternate weapon okay there we go let's go let's get it I should get it okay wait I need to go up or down doesn't matter okay I like this I like this I feel a bit better feel a bit better

behind the like corners and stuff I'm just gonna let them attack and hope they don't keep respawning and then it's safe to come out okay okay okay now hold on hold on all is not lost this might not be the most painful gameplay of rda side you've ever seen it's called tools pa the wildlife cannot okay hold on hold on hold on can you aim why does it never register like I really just not want to register what's going on with this bomb it wouldn't even like hardly let me perish it okay I've always loved the mechs it's here they're a bit it's starting starting throwing bombs at me I'm just gonna move on I honestly think it's safer just to ignore everything and like only shoot for like exp or something can I like crush them with a mech no I can't that's interesting oh no is that just get me out of the mech no way they put this in the game because then you are come on jump the mechs can jump oh my god that's so cool oh wait that looks like the mech can the mech crouch nope that's just reverse they knew exactly what they were doing freaking putting that one log there I'll have to get out the game knew that I wanted the mech I'm gonna get jump scared by like 10 things at once and now

something honestly honestly get much better um it was like pretty terrifying oh these things whip for quite a distance can I make it past without getting whipped okay okay I think wolves just don't like everyone in this game please don't knock me off the bridge that would actually ruin my day I don't have invisibility I'm gonna unlock the transport location unless unless unless that have I made a mistake I maybe don't need this transport location I just thought it was important to unlock but are there any games with hypno effect not that I can recall maybe that whoa these whoa whoa whoa whoa these flies are stun locking me sorry guys I'm gonna leave you behind to get absolutely annihilated because I don't want to deal with that did I don't know if that card game encryption has hypno in it I don't I don't know if I'm just making that up I I've not played it myself I think I've like paused for like two milliseconds uh to see huh whoa whoa whoa skipping watching my usual streamers for Sony does a new approach you I am an endurance streamer so if this is not your kind of game don't worry Mercy is going live in T minus two and a half I have never been happier to see these these guys wherever the heck they're what are they called let's see what they're called don't move a UT drone I've never been so happy to see a UT drone oh depends if you go the other route okay yeah the alternative stuff yet definitely there's not an inscription okay I misremember oh I'm so stressed playing this yeah I'm not even pretending okay I really appreciate that I already went to the ocarina time skull trainer we need to hurry tensions are starting to boil over at hell's gate oh I'll be just puked up in the verge of declaring martial law he's starting to invite scientists for questioning I'm not sure what he's nervous about we need to be careful if the time comes we may need to make some tough choices so Kendra wants you to report to Monroe at hell's gate if you're gonna give me 8000 xp for showing up sure I'll go to hell's gate pretty sure there are lots of sections of everything in vampires the masquerade and destroy all humans have hypnosis wait vampires masquerade do you get to play as a vampire that hypnotizes people that would be kind of cool oh my god I'm here for that oh okay I feel like we level up so fast this rda maybe the rda isn't as long I think so oh that's so cool maybe we'll take a look at that I've never played it or seen any gameplay of it but uh is that like a highly rated game dark souls 3 has rapport for anime potential I suppose I mean technically more door shadow and more door you can take technically like imprint enemies so they're not mean to you all right upload the harmonic I'm behind on my doomsday diagnostic this is the second song wrong with the emulator we could have an ecological meltdown okay let's hold up a sec what the hell is this emulator yes the emulator we're searching for a dormant well of souls right now once we find it we need to communicate oh they're pretending being called a first voice he's the only person who can awake in a well of souls they're pretending that the emulator isn't just a nuke once that's done we can control the entire ecosystem so back to that first ecosystem you're going to do a diagnostic well hey everything has its risk come now upload that harm they're lying to me not but we're still going to nuke the planet anyway once they're closer depending on the location of the dormant site you should check in with the man who doesn't in fact have the option to be a hypnotic and highly rated as a question it's a cult classic oh my apology I did not know that it's good might need to mess with it a little to make it work though it's an old game oh yeah doesn't Baldur's Gate have a bunch of them I'm not playing Big Baldi's Gate yet scenario don't start growing a brain it says it's corp is it like corp that can bring you get you guys in and out or is it another kind of corp the human colony and avatar is pretty impressive that emulators are one hope Baldur's Gate has tons of main controls especially because main flyers are a big part of the plot hmm doesn't have main control of the game it's quite a vtm vampire's masquerades old game it's not that kind of cool one we're going to Graves Bog okay did you know that in scots the bog is slang for the toilet did you know that in Australia the thunderbox is slang for the toilet I don't know what any slang for any other this voice actor sounds like grandpa max from band tan nice to watch band tan new set new set oh new scary

jeez louise so if I'm not part of the 20 players on this game r.i.p. I can't believe it it's such a legendary game I can't even say I recommend like I'll go out and buy it it's the experiences for me is more nostalgia although this part is like actually like I'm actually like having a challenge playing this part I'm still in disbelief the game even exists your hands are on the controller be like didn't sell the third oh the jet didn't see the turret sorry it's on you're doing good I've got two songs I think so far I'm sure by the way you missed the cutscene gate flying like a rocket launcher honestly yeah you leveled so far I wonder if the rda mission is actually like smaller than the main wait I want to unlock the fast travel before takeoff just in case level up whoops hey I like you too rider she said whoops I like you too rider whoa wait I'm not driving oh thank god right let's see how this develops oh the aim is a bit in front of us are you jung are you jung dad just ignore the ones from behind or what's the what's the deal did I just go for

deafening okay this just looks like an XP farm run I'm gonna say it but I can't even see what's ahead of me there's so much oh oh excuse me oh no whoa I don't even know you're just riding those like that oh what's going on what's going on oh the camera angle is like I'm not even driving who's driving this warthog did a terrible job of it um overheating oops hold on over here and I'm getting a little too overzealous with this weaponry okay this is just annihilation I'm starting to feel bad for the navi like as much as they're annoying when they're trying to kill me damn it engine won't start oh as they hold them off where I can't see oh god they're everywhere oh I don't know if I'm going to make this alive I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying hard oh my goodness can I see oh it's a blue plan I keep thinking it's a navi it's a blue plan come on start the car there's only so much back and forth I can do before we actually perish seriously oh my goodness right it seems like they're just falling back and thank good right don't do that again I'm sorry I yelled at you sweetheart he says to the car reflinges I'm sorry I yelled at you sweetheart I just get stressed when I'm playing the bad guys and everything's all skewed and I'm sorry if I skewed oh I don't want that to break she's doing her best for humanity absolutely denying it denying it sorry destroying it if I'm getting xp the first things are running away that's my car that's small that's one of more guys my oh I even know oh first things I just feel bad I feel like we're we're entering a zoo and then just executing all the animals inside the zoo this is what this run feels like honestly like they're literally running away now oh for xp so I can unlock a new armor why not perish that plan in front are you don't oh is that supposed to happen what a unique game mode to say the least I think you see about three of these guys if you play navi and you see 100 on this one section of the game alone we're strum beast pulling it's what it's been oh my god that was that was a slaughter I'm not even happy with that that was awful you're a lifesaver you're a lifesaver how about that strike stubby stakes all around okay the second shards right in this sector go grab it and report back to me and the third I'm working on it radios are toast everything slower here this is why the navi section has so few human campaign colors them now you know why you don't see them in this oh is it like all this damage has been done and we're just coming at the back end of it oh that actually makes so much sense and we're basic we basically come in when they're like at the end of the losing fight and we turn the tide okay oh my god that's so smart I didn't give the devs team like as much benefit as a doubt but that's so smart don't let him I was gonna say don't let him kill you because he's gonna aggro to me and I can just tell you is oh wait hold on where I'm trying to go hold on a minute let me pick there we go I'll just let him get in the back thing what new drift would be got um wait I think we're about to unlock the new one because now our arms are on show and I'm like that's the opposite of what our it does the hero maybe oh no clue if it's kind of it's just a joke of mine I mean it maybe because literally you only see two of them right where we need to go well I'm taking a car for that I'm not taking that back thing can I drive this oh can draw how do I shoot I don't know can I drive him over oh that was I was actually really mean I shouldn't have come up I kind of deserved it what are all those things are those reports um so can I not shoot I don't think I can I think I can only drive we're driving this buggy oh that's like such a long way to go I'll go on the outskirts to get the uh like uncovered map thing actually smash them against the wall oh I can't go that way this is so much more responsive than the buggy I have to admit I like that they make that differentiation uh okay we can't go this way I thought we couldn't come through the way the map made it look but we no I did not just do that oh I did not just do that oh I freaking did oh no no no hello game oh my gosh oh this is the worst thing that could have happened has not happened door stuck literally door stuck oh and I have to do all of this on foot whilst everything is aggressive to me right how much further do I have to go just a wee bit for it just down the street it's fine I just need to pop down the street it's like going to the corner shop it's just around the corner it's okay you can just teleport down I can't because I've not unlocked whatever it is it's not unlocked is it quiet is it safe question mark other than the fly trap just a wee bit more all is good this is called sniper's point implying that they're sniper navi looking at me right now question mark the ho hum okay whoa whoa whoa something's getting me I don't want a fly a fly got me a mosquito a mosquito got me oh whoa look at it freaking ready to like get me all right I'll wait until my inverse comes back yeah yeah that's right go back to sleep give me a stinky stinky plant don't like you abandoned rda camp well that doesn't that doesn't this is this this is not good for me I can tell you that much this is absolutely awful for me um I will take the teleport point just so I don't have to do that again um um can I hide here well he looks pretty enraged to me um I have nowhere I'm gonna go up oh no I can't go up I'm too small where where's the crystal guys I don't really want to go abandon hope yo you who may enter on the floor finger it's about hole oh there's this to spray them down hmm okay did they just run away from me now okay okay not too bad if I have a too little really destroy all this stuff too I mean it's 10 xp I'm not really sure it's worth taking the time to do that I will try and clear up this area because if I'm to like try and find a crystal in the middle we're still free jumping I don't even know what I'm supposed to look oh now you come around the corner no you're such a liar you're actually such a liar you're telling fivers why would you come around the corner now after I'd already sprayed you where on earth is this thing and he's already AI locked on me I don't know why the game pretends otherwise is there another turret over here that I can use I know the things back in that other section I'm just wondering what's up here why is there a dead end oh and it's just like one of these things jeez that gorilla and you're a lifesaver it's just abandon kind of showing you it's old abandoned hope you know dog pet dog it's a turtle I have no idea with pecking crystals already I go to me but I can't see maybe inside that building and that's why it's like flashing here oh pardon me wait I'm gonna go invisible and see if I can shoot it from that turret or is it already glued on to me no uh was it in here bro where is this freaking cell sample I don't know I'm gonna see if I can get rid of that last guy with us because he I just saw a second one wait let's get rid of you because you're in my way you're in my way you're in my way right no I think wherever the heck it is it's somewhere over here it's not been here yet I hate you what even if you're invisible oh he's got protection prayer on I can see it that's what that bloom boy here oh I just what did I get I got new armor and speed four I'll take that bro am I actually gonna have to look up a tutorial that was big oh a different outfit I'm like it's not that way it's out of bounds over there it's not like up here whoa sorry sorry it wasn't paying attention is it off could it be on where the heck is this one thing no don't spray on me no it's not time for that hello we're currently looking for something that my blind eyes cannot perceive it says it's somewhere in this area and I keep perfectly avoiding it wherever it is okay um now the avatars are coming in this area is it inside that maybe maybe it's inside this one whatever it is it's in the building oh if it's in this one I'm gonna be mad because I went in the other one oh for goodness gravy thank you what are the odds right finally got there in the end and there of course there's not fast travel to that guy because that would be too easy wouldn't that uh that speed is fast though like I'm pretty speed of course it was in the building that I wasn't looking at how could I be such a silly sausage I was beating up my car yeah I had to put a down payment on that right this is gonna be off topic I don't know if you guys have been watching a there's this youtuber that looks at people's finances like for entertainment but he always shouts at them for having a car and I didn't realize that a car loans were like really predatory in America and where they like make you pay like a ridiculous like percentage and stuff whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you just relax little flies you just relax thank you thank you these jumped us let's have been hiding all over the green and me two more no one more crystal and then I'm gonna go on the fritz you two huh how these guys be jammed and it took four times bad day for bets it seems no take these don't be better on me honestly I want you to collect the shard from a nearby navvy village okay let's give it a shot I believe this is the second last shard collection map and then we've done the campaign unbelievably uh we are just going for it I love being ignored in battle yay I love going so fast that the enemies don't target me yay I love not being a part of the fight ow he just spanked my boat good night rest well those who need to sleep uh sorry about kind of the surprise endurance stream I thought it was only four hours what we are oh for seven hours oh my gosh sorry sorry to anyone good night and rest well those who need to go please do not stay up against your health just to watch the vaude will be remaining for you soon tm you must kill tan jala before you collect the harmonic and the willow tree where we've got a boss fight but we can do it we can do it we can do it if we put our mind to uh we can do we're um Eric I'm not trying to go I'm behind a tent right now living up to the endurance streamer tag enemy yeah I wonder how many people didn't realize like when I said endurance streamer I meant endurance strummer okay right what am I doing just kind of kind of half follow the map oh oh I'm in the battle field by accident strummer look at his tail tan jala near me watch pride look at my speed my speed is amazing I'm a super soldier hmm it tastes like reasons I was surprised but I haven't missed them how I have streamed a heck of a lot of time I feel like maybe right or tan jala's been spotted near the willow tree it's like he's waiting there waiting for you I think watch yourself I can't even see the enemy you know that I actually can't eat I'm not being funny I didn't mean to good battle but if I genuinely can't see the freaking enemy what are you wanting me to do oh no way I've just engaged the freaking boss fight stop stop I've engaged the boss fight and there's like a literally a billion you're gonna make me pay myself please oh my god I think I need flamethrower to like oh my god I'm just getting absolutely gang violence here what am I supposed I need I need pop malts I need pop malts like right now they're all using freaking prayer protection I'm out of mana I'm out of mana I actually can't do prayer protection because I'm out of mana when I'm running out of freaking strength potion as if we were playing rescape right now oh my gosh what have I done what have I done what have I done I've just dived into the enemy I like literally can't see them prep the time oh and there's someone sniping me from behind as well not sorry but no it's just no on like you can't even just snake me from halfway across the map and why did that one run away I have no idea I guess I'm at range whatever the sniper one is still wound for me but at least that other one ran away okay that's the problem I have with the snipers they can do that yes thank you for coming freaking point blank why oh wow Tanjala pushed me so far out of his battle area he had literally DC no I can see that other NPC though can I shoot him oh that's the flamethrower darling that's the shotgun can I I just want him there we go I just wanted him to attack me no one else okay let's let's take it nice and easy nice and easy she says that she gets caught in trees no that no shotgun shotgun no no no no no no I missed okay this is what I want the shotgun stagger is exactly what I'm looking for right now it can be what what's the name of shotgun so it can be a spaz 12 is the name of a shotgun a stakeout is the name of a shotgun oh they're gun I don't remember any other ones off the top of my head not very good with gun names unless they're in black ops one and all on us too like Famous AK-47 submachine guns Susie's AK-47 new um MP5 very classic normally shown in movies mp5 k brian I have returned from the job strongy hope it's going well we're currently doing a boss battle and I'm getting absolutely wrecked tiny spiny but I can only do as much as I can it's taking a while I don't know I feel like maybe there's something I should know like maybe I should be in a mech at this point it's very plausible um but thank you for the ship we're getting there he's just cast protection sorry I like I don't want to waste the ammo since I've a little bit too left like stop with the prayer protection whoa whoa whoa okay I'm out of that so next is flamethrower we're just gonna no he gets so close when I do flamethrower like so close is he got fury on so he does double damage to me I think so I think that's what that was right we're just gonna have to do it seems he staggers with the assault right I think he's got light machine gun actually he's getting low so if he doesn't heal then I think we're in I think we're cooking by gas if he doesn't heal oh okay we did it we did it we did it we did it I cast mystic barrier honestly getting right isn't needing to use ult and hasn't poked the damage but someone either honestly first try like I'm just glad I'm not dying and getting stun locked where or why am I here why what am I to do oh wait I'm to do the song I'm to do the song I understand my apologies whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you need to relax and take your little acrobatic self away I need to do the song right now where is it right one and then do a triangle somewhere here no someone over here someone in the water okay okay triangle triangle triangle oh you don't attack whoa they are humongous if you're a baby wait where triangle well that would be a triangle maybe here okay okay not a perfect triangle so we're about through cages staggered to death honestly humongous wall strongy doesn't work for democracy wait wrong thing what did you guys think of hell divers I I got a chance to play it and I was like hmm I'm wondering if one of those things like if you have good company and then it's a fun game but who goes there identify yourself whoa get me out here because I just heard that we're just doing this

now and I don't know if that means I'm dehydrated I will have a mention here's pop up sorry I misnamed it I meant hell divers Sam um the hell divers like it was like people were they tried to make it so you had to have a PSN account or something just to play the game even though they advertised like you can still play your game even without the PSN part when in doubt drink okay is this good you're back quickly let's upload that harmonic okay this is the third song things are turning nasty around here Falco said if the emulator didn't work perfectly he put a bullet in my brain I doubt he was serious he was holding a gun to my head when he said that's serious enough for me hurry the harmonic Jesus that's so um he's so stinky level up yeah they tried to force PSN accounts to play which would have blocked a lot of people out and they're known for getting uh leaks deep rock galactic they made a lord of the rings version I think they called it mines of moria I've not played it but I hope it's multiplayer and I can like play with you guys I'd be so fun I'm going to bring my recommendation to Falco speaking of which you should check with him for your next mission we got the harmonic sir listen to me I want harper shut down now if you're too incompetent to stop his avatar all of an avatar right with him you think you can handle it or do I need to get a real jar head to do it I got it jar head recon shows link signals on the hanging I'll prove to you that I'm a real trooper I'll eat crayons and smile about it deep rock is crazy fun we're it we are going to the hanging

explosives don't worry we're almost in a few grunts oh you need new DT's if we're gonna make some noise I saw a chopper crash southwest of here maybe you can salvage some of the detonators from the rock get them back to winslow you'll know where to fire them all DT's sure DT's I know something should oh that makes broken I was gonna go in it uh if I go straight ahead then should be fine let's go why not wait straight ahead yeah straight ahead okay let's don't flip the buggy it's my only request it's killing why why would you do that you knew exactly what you were doing I can't get up oh I can't get up and everything's gonna attack me literally look on the map there's like a freaking massive ass battle bone it's over this is over for me yeah oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh golly oh gosh golly gee that really was not supposed to happen the dev who have created this map knew exactly what he was doing giving me a heart they're still here they're literally waiting to attack me it's getting a bit it's getting a bit non smooth it's getting a bit heady lads it's getting a bit heady okay we're with friends it's fine actually there's no way you're supposed to actually play the game by just dodging everything all the time but this is the best I can do under the turquoise and oh can I get this package please thank you objective complete let's get the heck out of here jeez whee where'd I need bro can you stop sending me like one side of the map to the other uh I don't this game is having an awfully fun time doing that how I can't even teleport there there's not even anything to teleport from if I take a right and don't fall off man you feel oh let's go let's go let's go just ignore me I'm not part of the field uh I'm actually oh I'm just a field medic you what is it that British Red Cross rule or something I can't get over I have to go to a low all the one taking fall damage and I'm literally two centimeters off the grind so oh we have to take the long round through all those navi and they're attacking me oh the navi and attacking me name a better drill do I go that way yes I can go that way I literally went invisible as that guy struck me no white crosses for health packs and games and stuff apparently that's a war crime also shooting unarmed medics exactly like seriously what's going on here you cannae jump it no I cannae jump it right I'm sure these are bombs yeah okay I was gonna say I'm sure there's something off of those I had to find out for myself I'd find out the hard way so many of them um okay you don't you don't even respond to that oh oh my guess they don't hurt the oh oh no no no there's no human here I'm actually a I'm a mouse I'm a mammal no wait navi aren't considered mammals rather I'm actually gonna claim this pod first and then going with I'm probably gonna get shot in the bum with an arrow though oh oh and there's another one right there ha ha ha very funny game no human here only a cut literally I'm a I'm just an innocent little seh full of pod doing my thing you know you're in a good time just need to try and speed run getting out of all these absolutely atrociously dangerous areas and then we can finally destroy pandora and live happily ever after wait oh wait no you do that myself wait this is a dead end can you stop please I'm literally stuck here with you is this a dead end yes or no have I just gone a horrifically wrong way why would you do that okay I need to now take the biggest freaking circle over hi everyone I'm back thank you for joining again we are still the rd we're still the bad guys and we're still avoiding every fight possible under the sun because this is just impossible there's no way I refuse to believe this is even plausible humans number one baby innocent innocent no I'm an innocent cuttlefish hold on a minute I don't know if you've seen them or anything oh that scared me I'm gonna I'm gonna I actually need to heal I need to heal but I want to stop because I think I'm gonna get my bum bitten oh my god the paralysis from those flies are so punishing so punishing I'm gonna see if I can run past both of these but oh poison poison poison hello am I walled off again what have I done to me why what have I done to deserve this name why I'm so confused why I can't access this area I literally need to go down okay that dog can't come on me on the branch oh can I climb down this or is this Navi no it can't be Navi only I'm human I can't freaking do it bro I'm gonna explore the whole map before I actually get to my my location I can't believe explore the whole map I mean drowning people might have been a thing I've not done it yet I'm not even being successful in doing my first hypnosis stream this is I'm getting absolutely spun about in this game you know that well I'm about to discover an outpost I don't know what's gonna happen when I get to it but I literally discover the whole map before I get unlock the next objective oh goodness me everything's abandoned and there's the name one I freaking saved me so if I go down here it's still the wrong place I need to drop below can I drop below on the upcoming thing did I miss that please don't put me all the way back I have been traveling for a day and why would just upon me I need to I need to gently go down on the map gently go down on the map getting the buggy we're driving because this is taking far too long to unlock the next objective I don't know how I perish from that but what whatever right so that's a crossing right so so okay okay okay there's a really I'm getting trolled I'm getting trolled where am I how I need to go backwards like this way no like this way go back and do a U turn right I need to do a U yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I need I figured out how I get there I think oh my goodness that was a fun noise that was just the noise of pure shock and horror oh and I'm about to hit a navi driver of course I am because why would I why wouldn't I hit a massive navi driver straight ahead and I'm about to uncluck right in front of them all hi guys do you just want to totally annihilate me one by one you might as well line up and have a little conga going you know just to really drive at home how much I am dead me in this game I like how actually I just uh I will say one thing I like how I'm always like congratulated like from how much I'm achieving but the reality of the situation is I am just like cheesing all the way through the battles I'm like literally not injuring any navi whatsoever and they're like wow you're doing amazing out there on the battlefield and reality like I'm just doing backflips all the time and getting away from the enemy finally got there and yeah that took so long take us out to dinner first this can happen to you you love nature that's what I get for loving nature that took wait this teleport site was already on um I'm fine that took me how long together please try not to blow yourself up I can't believe that 10 saying did they both blow up or what are just the one what am I blowing up something anyway oh I'm blowing up the freaking rocks that blocked me from moving in the first place hardy hardy hard very funny already freaking that's not supposed to happen what was it what am I getting shot by that's nice oh this game's trawling me sounds like we've got company seems like we've got company I don't like the sounds too many vital words it's going to be some way to slow them down I'm on it it's got to be some way to slow them down uh okay we're on your mark oh we're almost there hold on hold on for me you're so close right I've got healing four that's what I like to see let us put down these oh is that a bomb oh that's a bomb has to be bombed anyway me that's supposed to be bomb yeah all right the bomb did activate even though I did it like that at the same time okay okay just to do it one more time one more time it's okay it's okay right they're both they're both wow I'm getting slowed down by the enough enough enough I'm getting slowed down oh that's all right you just want to spend more time yeah see how you journey you have to say you're over you know you're still running through the dank thing but how about that half the gears all day gone on hydration check when there's orders to fill the power cell in the system reactivate the thing okay I'm analyzing the map so I can basically go everywhere I just got the sweep since I was looking at it dog was getting shot in the background literally the purvy thing it's no therefore they spawned on time uh me oh it's such a shame purvy dogs also me the dogs won't leave me alone I've had enough no that's too many no that's one too many so that's actually one too many that's three too many if any more come at me I'm actually be region this is too much how are you supposed to genuinely do this like does the devs expect you to pause and do this every single time there's no way I'm getting bit to death though there's no way in heck I refuse I refuse then we're gonna get spat on by the flies and then there's mere dogs okay I somehow am making it do I need to take a little to the okay I need to drop the buggy when I get ahead here and then I'll have gone through the section pretty quickly there okay we're all good again that is a pretty plan I honestly I'm surprised I can wow okay there's allies ahead that's all I could see mate you're just letting that plant absolutely decimate you for no reason okay this is like so much easier can you actually burn the plants you know that oh wait wait wait it's too many too many dogs why are there so many multi-different colors but when you play like the navi side where you're supposed to like be appreciating nature and stuff it's just like if I have the backtrack one more time right thankfully I can teleport here you make me backtrack one more time game I'm gonna have it out for you then I'll make myself clear we surely must be getting back up soon with this one I feel like we grabbed all the songs so what now so we're to get in hard for deeds um the navi side did the game is good the rda side I'm just wanting it to be over with it's too hard like I'm genuinely hard no I'm not hard sorry the game is genuinely hard on the rda side okay so Kendra's got in doubts of what the thing is and I don't mean I don't mean that um so when we get the offer why is it sending me this map is a nightmare to navigate I'm not being funny this is probably one of the hardest maps this no this will this will be the hardest map ever that I've had to navigate and do all this stuff and I don't even know where to start maybe the one to my left if I take a left and then before no if I take a left and then take a right this is the filter for the human campaign literally like it's getting rough it's getting rough being like told to go and I know they provide transport via the the mechs and the the buggies and that but if you're going to do it that your buggy health makes you explode and you have to reload there's no point in providing that kind of thing like it's just name is gonna be wait if I can okay I can resurrect I need to take the first right though I can resurrect but it's fine oh please don't I'm gonna run out of hiding I am running for my life I didn't even know they were going to do Thanos in the middle no no please leave me alone please I ask kindly and respectfully to respect my space I very kindly ask you to respect my social distance social distance please I don't know if you've seen that Scottish meme where the guy goes social distance please but you said it so politely I'm I'm just hauling ass there's no way I'd make this without oh right where's it up here to be honest okay this is actually okay I'll give the game devs something this is actually kind of cool I like the classic like spiral up something I'll see it I'll see it whoa lovely lovely thank you devs thank you devs for putting a crack in the fricked rock stairwell I'll take everything I said back about this design take it all back random gap in the stairwell whilst you're getting whacked by Navi and the dogs are biting your ankles at the bottom of the rock face and things are exploding there's like an exploding plan that's aiming on me right now that's what that is oh speaking of exploding plans here's the bam himself yeah yeah yeah yeah okay right I am now going to use that teleport to go back to that wiggly one up there no I'm losing the will to live just get me out of here right um take if I go here and I take a right I definitely have access to whatever that right one is get wasted surely saved yes thank god mission failed we'll get him next time just spawn me on whatever you want it's fine I need to take a right

destroy nature in peace right faggo this way yes let's get to it let's get to it everybody look good to do oh you weren't wait what they're fighting they're fighting each other right go no no go fight the navi then they border with me you were fighting him a minute ago all willy-nilly then you look at me all of a sudden no having it what am I supposed to be doing here hold on put me up here so I can see oh I'm supposed to go down um oh oh that's not nice who's doing that what's that whoever's doing that you stop that I can see you shouldn't have I can't see you yeah stop cease your activities I said cease your activities that's ridiculous of plant being able to freaking send off a bone like that who wrote this game I'd say I can rate better but that's not true oh no I have to go all the way around to get down there there's no way to fall down there safely well well I need to do a big old U-turn do you hate the navi yet no I hate playing the RDA say to deal with the navi I can see that much very strongly but I don't understand how there's plants around here that the navi can claim because that it's not like I can you like it I'm just bombing everything actually I probably just bought myself you know that unless I can get out here fast enough whoa whoa whoa whoa we need to do that okay please tell me I did them all I didn't do them all oh it was to grab a crystal my apologies didn't realize my apologies my apologies I suck I suck but it's okay please don't do that please don't do that please don't corner me because that's not really oh not good I am in the rock I am in the rock I'm in the rock I'm in the rock I'm in the rock I'm in the rock yeah it's right you can throw me in that direction throw me in that right no no no no you're taking the pest you're taking the pest you're taking the fist you don't need to do that please stop embodying on me I'm trying to dodge the AIM but I don't have health unlock I can heal now I can even go next I can almost go Gon vice I can almost go go in viz hold on where's the last thing that I need to go if I take if I just go back to where I came from that sounds I mean if I go back to my hotel for how did I get there though I go forward and take a right surely I'm a bit I'm a bit disoriented on this map if I take a right on this log if I get on that log then I should be able to do you mind honestly give me a jump scare whenever he is like hanging about honestly I can't believe it I can't believe that you're hanging about on your planet they really wanted you to know that the RDA or the bad guys literally so punishing to play the RDA side sorry but it like Navi so easy I was an overcritical but I don't think the game is balanced well it just it just seems like unless I'm missing like the gun that you're supposed to use in quotation marks I am getting brutally oh no I don't use the teleport I do 180 and I go this way just to make triple sure yeah I do not want to take off in the wrong direction it's punishing but fun if it's fun for you to watch me get punished then sure punish me away but this is region just think I'm just doing so bad I can hear again they gave you a guard down for stealth no run kills off I hope this is the area I'm gonna cry if this is like a dead end up here both to play and watch you honestly I never understood like streamers that can like punish themselves over and over the same game like I just don't well that's what I don't want none of that I swear if there's a dog behind me stop it okay that's him there I'm really not interested in going down to get wrecked by all the other NPCs as well but I don't think I almost just forfeit all that progress right there that's my shotgun and you put that way so I can do rounds who are you oh come on come on do it do it do it do it do it do it you know you want to you know you want to you know you want to get that health bar is zero for me baby oh no fall dammit hmm right I'm not gonna go in the vines next time he was honestly taking a hammer in I feel sorry for me can you play the RDA side okay I've respawned in the area which is good but bad because the NPCs are literally all okay okay we actually didn't lose the progress on the health bar I don't think I've seen that before but lol oh wow just spawn all the NPCs together I don't you know it's fine I didn't want anyone let me reload let me reload and I can deal you oh wow I'm actually out of ammo that's how much you've made me spam that shit no can you aim can you aim hello oh for crying out loud can you aim at the frickin guy that is literally one millimeter from your eyeball yeah you're getting I thought I dealt with you don't even bother my was he shooting the buggy I think he was oh I just need to make it back to this person and then I think I'm done with the worst map ever this map belongs under my sweaty feet never to be allowed to breathe fresh dry air again that was awful and I wish not to ever be subjected to this because oh my gosh I know there's buggies everywhere but I don't even want to get in them because they just explode in a millisecond goes to the trash ah so it's a good map no it deserves nothing but my manky sweaty grippers perma sweat oh my god don't don't give me another map like hanging gardens again hanging gardens more like I it makes me want to hang myself thank you'll be here all week and bad news both avatars are dead let me guess neither one of them was harper oh I've still not defeated harper okay I guess we've got another map after that it's deeper in the forest how to pin check with officer Midori she might have an update three rock shards so where do I grab this harmonic yeah good question it's thick out there and that radar serious service but I got something more I'm picking up a faint more it's not over just might be our willow tree wait say it again with the bidim's wait say what again tell me tell me I've already forgotten what I'm supposed to say what did I say I've already forgotten what I'm supposed to say I'm ready I'm ready for where I'm supposed to say I was it what's the map called I've already forgotten Kendra's picked up a signal way out there it's not much but it's something all right so the maps called hanging gardens more like I want to hang myself thank you thank you oh my god they're still not done of the fucking I'm not really able we'll be should be here all week bro we'll be here all week on this freaking one map on this one map they really did not want anyone to have fun on the RDA so it's like literally I want to say this is the harper fight and then I think that's it no no I'm not even scared anymore I am annoyed if I take a right then either way I'm gonna make it to the location some people enjoy suffering myself included but do you enjoy watching suffering like I actually don't mind watching like a binding of Isaac runs and if the person like struggles to get through it but still wins like I don't mind watching like I find it quite entertaining all right if I take the vines across yeah yeah okay oh and there you are thank you yeah yeah yeah please don't do that oh wait no they're gonna push me off the freaking veins if I go up stop stop spanking me it's Emmy who has that audio this month okay not me I do not have that kind of audio I need to go down no I better not need to go down something they are what I need well I'm a bit scared to go on this and all honestly I found it the willow tree oh right a boss fight with harper but I got no way down it's in a deep cavern I got to find another way in a lot of good that didn't it looks like a corp graveyard around here got it what kind of audience we have this one leave it to grunts to add some mellow I have sent training one I'm trying to remember the other two off the top of my hand I should have a call one of them is part of my 1.4 a I have to four part of series and part one comes out this I almost just did what you think I almost just did I almost fell off the map doing that man over there that was very scary yeah rather than you should change yourself to suffering oh that just cancelled my invisibility okay that's fine no I totally didn't need that it's not like the cool-down times like a whole 60 seconds or something oh yes thank you please oh shoot them I can't be bothered anymore after this I don't really like oh after things I don't really like when you have that saleswoman the year if this human is just miserable I mean it's fun it's not too bad like honestly I'm actually enjoying to see what RDA say this but this map size is mercenary oh you ever alright right girl moment wait oh right no so this is max max protection well I'll take max protection and now we need to go this way what's that I'm to take one of these head or shoot I'm right up on oh a jeez looey let's do that one over here oh oh loss cathedral a kinder remains me of the underground cave in Skyrim why is the music even scarier oh please be a small map oh it's a small map like y'all do thank you if it's small what just got me who are they above me it must be the Navi above me okay the Navi are oh there he is mm-hmm I have a problem and that problem is everyone has heists advantage over me yeah this unless they come down and bite me I am in so much trouble oh dear I'm gonna get snagged out of it I don't have infinite ammo I can't be messing around like that I don't have it now is there really no way for me to go unless it's over here I get out no it's wow this is like really rare to see in a video game unless I'm just I don't play many video games I really do not recall levels where you can't even reach the person I don't know maybe I'm being silly yeah see this is right you can go right one down I don't know how much health he has but bro I can't I cannot be spraying him with pistols like oh wait I have infinite ammo here silly me silly Billy hold on I saw that shooting I just spray him the entire time then I mean I'll do it don't think I won't you don't have to tell me twice if it's a spring free mission sure he just runs around in circles over and sadly I can't seem to reach the other NPCs oh they're attacking me actually getting they jump in yeah whoa the AI is so brutal as a mavi sorry hold on I'm starting to I don't know if I should actually just focus on the main guy you said the I don't know if they're infinitely respawning or not that's the reason why I want to clear them out but I'm getting the feeling they're infinitely responding maybe oh I just destroyed that plant where is it wow I'm like actually struggling wow okay half hell I think just more I think just more down it's the best I got I'm just gonna tank it I'm I really am I'm just gonna tank it yeah this definitely is given like battle dome unending and thanks for waiting around until I stand up again actually do appreciate that AI oh that's not good that's really not good oh this is what I was worried about but there's definitely more spawning and I'm not way sure what the answer is other than spray him that's really the best I can do just hope that we mavi cross hairs going on he is getting staggered he is getting staggered there's there's no denying that but the Navier again our control up here I don't have high the plants keep respawning I don't know if maybe the plants the battle rifle can help you in this moment oh my god shotgun and shotgun ah well let me thought since way doesn't feel like nothing's happening right now what gun the battle rifle battle rifle or any launcher Neil Gunn is it actually called battle rifle issue rifle I've got machine gun ish standard issue hold on he looks oh hold on hold on hold on I'm just flopping on my face hold on leave it oh okay okay it's like a triple bar okay it's triple bar we're trying we're trying that's the main thing like we can do it we can 100% do that I believe I believe it's just gonna take a sweet time like especially if the game just constantly is resupplying with new Navi for this guy it makes me think this is the last boss fight in the last match though because this is big like this is big this is protection prayer on I can hardly see his body to okay yeah okay okay okay frickin did it we don't do okay oh oh he's mad I foiled his plans he said resin for us and okay let's okay okay hold on let me let me get off let me go let me go let me go let me go hello hello I can't even heal because I'm getting pushed against the wall oh I've swapped to pistols thank you for swapping to pistols the most useless out of everything no it is very much needed right now very much needed the most useless no I need to go I'm in viz yeah man viz literally I'm gonna heal on rock I'm gonna heal on rock yeah and I'm pressed up against this dog you're gonna have to let me breathe seriously video game this is like I'm just gonna run away so best thing I can do right now do not engage do not engage oh come on who said the same thing who said the same thing no no I did not want this oh goodness yeah I think I've actually died you know that I've only got one like cell thing oh I'm glad I have protection up but I'm I'm I actually don't have faith you know that I'm losing faith I do not believe unless I can grab these quick enough I literally don't have a revive if I go down by the way yeah see this that this the amount of abilities they use I'm sure I could probably be utilizing my abilities better but like this prayer protection is so constant it's so fucking constant I really hope nothing else responds I can't tolerate if he's gonna get stuck I will happily take that oh my god more spawned in please I literally don't have a revive I honestly don't have a revive I don't have ammo looking where did he go oh lovely I feel like Lara Croft oh my god they have reef I don't even have it please no more battles please I'm on my knees I can't I genuinely wholeheartedly I'm not gonna make it if they make me do it anymore up here sorry I need to find revives but I don't have any more revives and I keep getting like that a lot like locked in on your knees I'm not even getting like on my knees like please tell me you didn't do it anymore I think I'm genuinely gonna lose this like lose the game because I don't have a I don't have a revive and I don't know what happens if you perish without a revive on your knees for a head fat oh I genuinely don't have a revive and I feel like we're about to enter like some boss get me out of the hangin gardens you down the game town really shocking behavior oh how am I back here again you've done it and clean Harper's clock in the process great work writer we should have enough harmonics now to find that dormant site hook up with Trudy and be lined back to base I'll meet you there I think because I'm not killing maybe there's a medal or two well teammates and all right yeah right meet me back at Hell's Gate this should be the last harmonic have protection for now I think it is because I'm not because I'm not picking like a heart and Navi I'm not able to pick up more revives but like I'm in danger oh I don't know if I'm gonna win this I don't know what happened on your knees ready to create a dreams camera in himself literally I'm like did they play test this for like noobs this is like soul play Monro's gone missing things are going bad or worse you'll have

Navi we're about to finish the RDA side however it is my he's not in his office resource development oh wow actually can't go I actually can't go like in his office space that's a very small detail well the office is scared Falco is always evil yeah he's like evil till the end we can do it we just not need to die or get walled off by like three Navi at one going into his office space to take his red links safer that for safer okay she gives me a thumbs up now I went to the avatar station and found Monroe he's dead and the it's Falco writer you've got to reach the planes at the oh there you

and we were never reach panelists that clear enough for you yes sir a free amp oh sorry possible they've got your order and he spawned it I'll get you a dragon to channel isn't cars from the guy from the first movie I think so they seem to have been able to get the likeness of everyone like Sigourney weaver was at the start of it as well so it seems like when this game was made they got the rates the new brass said they were sending me a problem solver I should have known it was you how's your day been Batista painful I got a whole list of ever heard that name waiting the blues keep sending in their damn birds to turn us back back and I help they ain't moving until they're there but you stop okay another boss you say yeah where is it um right can I take a car please just to really speed

because you're in my way RDA I said you're in my way RDA say it's not me it's not me it's not me jump scare after all these struggles getting bullied by the AI the game felt bad and is just letting me do like get through it seriously that last map though I'll take that one to my grave we hate the hanging cliff we should be clear to move your team now rolling thunder yeah just wait till I get out of here before you start blasting I can't make any promises you're not gonna wait until it get one out of three field commanders okay then surely the games up somehow I knew you'd end up right in the eye of the storm feels like the storm is following me courage said you need some help right I've hit a bit of a snag in my operation his name's Akado savage but a bloody skilled one responsible for at least a dozen missing men and he's left the rest of them spooked I need you to put this animal down I'll try all right we're heading oh someone was smart enough to go ahead and activate that teleport just in case we were doing a little back and forth and we actually need to teleport to it I am so smart that's gonna do the Homer Simpson way it's them working I am so smart said you're in my way RDA oh well you know what I've literally just spawned here go into an actually actually do everyone just pause I teleported here and I'm already getting rolled oh so now you're green with me smart no the S MRT that there's not how is there a tree of souls here unless when you swap to the Navi you get a Navi body oh that's what I need um yeah I need a advantage is there anything I can take a advantage on there's a fucking thing gonna chase me on my ball I'm now getting I'm not getting wrecked by his pals as well not test protection I just activated like five NPCs to join in I can't even run out of the way in time this is insane this is insane I don't know what to do there's like literally nothing I can cheese on please can I cheese on this oh please oh please let me cheese on this so badly please please I'm cheating I'm cheating I'm cheating so hard right now I'm not okay okay okay they all got pushed off let's go uncheese uncheese uncheese command and she's command and she's command and choose command right now uncheasing uncheasing commence uncheasing commence uncheasing commence uncheasing commence untruth you are all gonna need to like stop with this freaking blasting thing. This is an absolute nightmare. Like all of them are using... I can't. I can't. I hate to be the UwU girl that goes, I literally can't right now. I literally can't right now. I don't even know where the Thanator is. Is the Thanator stuck? At least she's the Thanator. Are you stuck? Oh thank the maker. Thank the maker, this is a buggy old 2009 game. Eat lead in puke because oh my gosh this game is so hard. I heard that, I heard you, I literally just heard you spawning. Oh yeah and just heal up. No it's fine, it's fine, just heal all your health. It's fine, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. No it doesn't matter at all. Get out of my face. No, no! All the time. Get out, I'm literally freaking walling on stuff. Go away. Stop healing, stop healing. Stop! I need to reload like this right now. Yeah, hold on, let me take a breather. I just needed one breather, like literally a second to formulate a thought. Ah! Ah the freaking... I'm trying so hard, I literally am trying so hard. This is just, and then just spawn more navi there, they're coming down the hill. I'm stuck against something. Oh please, please! Oh, um, uh, I cast protection. Oh, oh and um, oh, oh, don't do that, don't do that again, that's not funny. Talk meeeeere! I'm gonna fucking lose it if I actually die here. Go and just perish to the elements or something. This is insane. This is standing the field up. No. Get staggered beyond belief and they don't stagger when they use that ability. And their ability to freaking his own cooldown, there's no such thing as cooldown to them, they actually don't know what it is. But my cooldown lasts forever! Literally I can't even cast protection. Oh and I need to reload at the stupid freaking orange box! And I've got one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No one's surprised. Freaking spraying. It's literally the more health... No, yeah, you just do it again. Again with the same move. Oh this is getting ridiculous, mate. Go and just get a rest, honestly. Oh and you'd repel back to health again because you can't even just 1v fucking 1v. Literally, I'm not being funny, but if these are like supposed to be avatars with like titanium bones and stuff and you literally can't 1v 1v without fucking prayer protection on every 2 seconds with that stupid move! Oh, fucking terrible, actually. Just perish! Honestly, stop using these abilities. Oh my god, man. Yay, we did it! Let's go! Oh, I'm so glad that's over. Right, let's move on to the next one. Yeah, and they're already shooting me. Already, already, already. Right, okay, we'll teleport. Gigi easy. Oh, I just... I keep forgetting that I'm not as tall as Navi so I can't just jump that. Oh, well, I didn't need to go on that so sure, whatever. We did it! That was awful. That was awful. You don't even pick the difficulty in this thing. My controller is literally dripping with sweat. I thought you loved having autism. It's such a nice little fun tree on the side, doesn't it? Not. Oh, and I get to do one more. The protection prayer made me think this was a runescape stream for a second. Yeah, literally. If I could cast it. Oh. Is there a donation? Did I miss a donation? I think it's working. I don't know. Someone said they couldn't but then I think a few more donations came through after that so I don't know if it's messing up on Firefox or things are just not happy. Don't worry about it if it's not working. Oh, sorry. I just... Oh, I just choked on that. What month to go? Plain? Take a scorpion and report to the last commander. Yeah, let's try it. Oh. You'll read it later. I just sent one a bit ago. I don't see it. You're not the only one to say that you've sent a thingy but it's not came through. I don't know why. The last one I see is from TinySpiny. It says I've returned from the dog. Wait, did it actually not go through? I don't want you to don't know if it's not showing up seriously though. Like if it's not showing up, don't know. I don't know what's going on. Where the heck? What am I supposed to go on my... Can I just fly through that? Oh, no. I have to fly through the gap. I can already tell. The last commander seems promising. I can hope so. The RDA site is... It's been an experience but I'm not sure it's been won for... Yeah, okay. Okay, okay. Let's just break through the rocks. Don't mind me. Don't worry. I'm always happy to escort my local calm fish. I know I wouldn't display them. Where am I going? Just a little to the right. Oh, my goodness. Okay, there's the helipad that I'm supposed to land on. Thank goodness. Make it nice and easy for me. A little cheeky crash land in there. Don't mind me. Is this not it? Looks like it. At least when it's over, you can see you've finally completed the game. Honestly, it's been fun but there's a reason my Tism didn't attach on this game too much because there's quite a few things like that that are really annoying. Hey, last one. Oh. The only reason I could even win that last fight is because I managed to cheat that Thanotaur. I cannot imagine if I would even get past that if that Thanotaur didn't get caught in the roll. I'm sorry. I said that wrong. Am I allowed to slide to get there? I'm going to be giving me a mix. I'll take a mix because he's giving me a mix. Then you can play the domination minigame. I like on the navi side. I've never played it on this side. Alrighty. If I take a right, then everything shall be alright. Let's hope this last one. Strony, you sound sleepy. I hope you're having fun. You know, I'm having fun. I know that sounds like a- That's a fat punch. I'm getting spawned spanked by a freaking plant. I'm enjoying it. It's just because I've never played it before. I just did not expect at all how unbelievably hard it was. For example, there's RDA soldiers literally getting messed up by these plants. They're just letting it happen. I had no idea they would make it so hard. On the navi side, you can just ignore everything. But when you're a wee human, you actually can't ignore everything. Or else you're like a big doo-doo. I'm hoping I do get a good night's sleep soon because it's really hard to be creative. RDAs and MarkoLabs are coming up with scripts when I've literally got no thoughts going on behind my skull. There's RDAs. I'm actually going to pick it up because they're too valuable. Wait, I can't even go up on my head. Okay, I need to climb on foot. RDAs say it's too real sad. I hope you're doing a good night's sleep. Yeah, I've not had a decent one in quite a while. Oh my god, there's so many of them. Okay, that was good. I like that. I think it tears that fast all the time. That's great. See, when it misses, it really bothers me. Oh, I'm just going in biz. I don't know. There's enemies everywhere. Oh, I can hear one right behind me. I'm going to try and claim this before default. Get some rest. I will get some good rest. I don't know what my stream is tomorrow. I can't remember. Is it ASMR? Or is that a small game? I think it goes ASMR sweets. Oh, this is a boss fight. Yeah, I'm already getting ruled. Oh, I'm already getting ruled by boss. Okay, this is what I can't stand. I'm about to go do a boss fight and there's like a billion rub. Nah, nah, come on, mate. Yeah, this is getting ridiculous. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank goodness I was picking up RDA things. Whoa. No, no, you're so dead. Get that. Right, a spell of protection, spell of invincibility, because what the actual? Bro, you're going to need to let... I'm dead on the last one. I need a breather. I literally need a health breather. The AI can freaking see me. Yeah, she literally won't go down because she keeps activating all of her abilities. This is ridiculous. Right, so they're... Okay. Bro, you're just stun-locking me. I literally can't get close enough. Yeah, how do you like being fucking stun-locked? Oh, fuck off! Just infinite spawn after spot. So get the fucking moab out, honestly. What the fucking is this shit, honestly? Have I activated it? Hello, stamina? Lovely. Let me analize. That did a sweet fuck all. Lovely, lovely. Don't ever show your fucking hideous face again. That was what bloody waste that was. Right, that's the best I got, Berserk. Berserk's literally the best I got. And I get stunned the moment I use it. Bro, I need to put a little invisible on so I can literally heal in time. I'm gonna get stunned the millisecond. This is why I don't play read games on stream because I literally can't even handle a normal game. And then invisible again so I can't get him and then tarot him shooting at me and then stun me, and stun me, and stun me, and stun me, and stun me, and stun me. Okay, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it. We love a good stun, we all... And then, yeah, and then into the spawn rate. What are their abilities? You literally just use that one so you don't even have a cooldown at all. Oh, and then in comes your buddy use. Yeah, and then your buddy uses their ability. And then I'm away wasting ammo yet again. Oh, yeah, again, I'm not the frickin' boss. You're gonna need to get a great game. Honestly, you're gonna need, again, a straight to ability. Can't, need to wait, need to wait. Again, straight to ability. Fucking infinite, buddy. Yep, and then the gift. No, oh, a Christmas miracle. I actually got a fucking thing from it. Wow. Oh, and your pal's already back. I've not even been away for, like, on the list, I think. I'm gonna have to go into this and fucking do this, right? At least I've reloaded, but... Yeah, and I'm already in spanked. I don't even remember the fucking enemy that I'm supposed to be killing is. Oh, and straight to the ability. What a classic. Oh, more of your pal's! There's nothing I can do. There's actually nothing I can do other than tick damage. This is just the tiniest amount of damage that can be dealt at any moment. And it just... Over and over again! Literally playing this game over and over again. One hit, get nothing more. Have to heal, get nothing more. Just fucking perish off. Fucking map! Uh, I'm dead. I'm actually dead. I don't have a invis, and I don't have a heal. I don't know what you want me to do. Who made this? Ubisoft? How many game... How many fucking playtesters have you got? Like, one max, maybe? Do you share one for, like, one fucking region? One for whole of Oceanic? One for whole of Bloody Europe? One for whole of fucking America? Like, what's going on? None of you's playtested this. Not one person. Not one person! Listen! Oh, let me just analyze and see if this is... There seems fair. Hmm... Right, let's do infinite spawning. Let's make sure you get stun law, right? Okay, hmm... Alright, let's do it. Let's do it! Let's do a cheeky gangbang! Oh my God! Let's just do a cheeky gangbang and make sure that the enemies... Enemies are allowed to infinite heal. It's fine. Enemies can infinite heal. Enemies can infinite fucking use their abilities. All the fucking time! And as soon as you give them a Santa me are off of their HP bar Oh, let's just make sure they just give them everything all it wants infinite fucking mana. Oh My god Just let it be over with Just let it happen. Oh my god Like I literally need to go invisible Oh my god, just let it be over Just let it be over Again, yeah instant stun lock as soon as you shit. I don't even have that ability is Navi when I play Navi I don't even have this ability Just instant fucking lock over and over and and your pals are back I Would absolutely love to have a whole fucking trade behind me, but I've nobody got that extension have a I Best I can do 100 got 100 shotgun shells was there enough may you go get more Because it was now of course it was down off. Oh, yeah, no, it's fine. No, it's fine. I didn't want one Yep, no, it's fine. I Love being absolutely incapacitated No, this is so fun I Love it. You should do it more Ashley. How about you just spawn eight NPCs all fucking one said one time. Oh my fucking god Fucking RDA fan is honestly. Oh, and I'm probably gonna die jumping off this clutch looking me Just to really fucking ace it on the cake. They just actually can he stop it. They actually Yeah Yep, and all aimed even though in viz all in will continue probably not even be able to heal and play man I get to die Because I only have one fucking RDA element to my fucking name But here Yeah This better be the last mission. I am like fucking correct right now. I Really hope like I severely hope this is the last mission I Instant damage to the mech not even in the body sign For the cheeky gang bang party parrot party parrot party parrot It's never fucking ending volt was it vault Vulcan thank you for the tip. It's never ending. There is no way that was appropriately play tested unless I'm missing like Some major notes and I missed a massive patch that came out for this game in 2009 that there's no way That is the gameplay and then the dev team happy with that game Refused to accept that that even got passed Absolutely refused to accept that got passed I Don't think anyone got this far in the police say I completely agree with that statement because what on earth was that Literally, I don't have an ability when I play Navi if I get hit I have a massive fucking throbbing Fucking pulse coming from a bloody groin. No, I don't want to teleport. I want to talk to the man Please let it be over Hmm let it be over Let it be over. Yeah, I'm not Let it be over Yeah, that Moab did absolutely nothing. I don't even know what the point of that was Let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over Thanks for borrowing a condom This game was pretty bad pretty fast after lunch thanks to the game getting canned hard And took their money in around I mean they made them if they got two points seven million sales. Yeah Are we there You so much you put a scratch there there last at least the section saying you were you mean that wasn't the last section Are you implying there is more to this fucking thing? Horses or did you to board a dragon to fly to some location? This is why mommy likes me hold her hand. Yes. This is why I like You're still streaming. Oh, you just missed the part where I screamed down the make so yeah Oh Please let me go with this right why does the conductor keep putting me on? Why did they keep creating more and more sections of this fucking site of the map? Okay, this is it this is it the map looks like this is it there's nothing more of the matter We just got worth it fuck was gone broke. Oh Well, we all pretended that you finished the game and you can go risk. No, this is it Look at the map. There's no way this map is a fetch quest because look at the state of it. There's nothing on it. Oh Did I get to drive this at least It's over It's over Oh, how do I fly this? Oh fuck me, man. Oh No, oh no, I don't like that. Oh, no Right, okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, huh. Oh, yeah, I can fly I can fly Call me Peter Pan because you can fly you can fly you can fly Okay, take it easy easy on the corners easy Pandora is a little wild for the road bumps and by road bumps the full mass of asphalt You can shoot the rocks Oh Oh Wait, I'm gonna run out of missiles That was a very successful drive, I think I don't think I actually bumped into one thing Easy easy Oh Okay, there are wolves, but that's fine. Nothing I can't handle. Oh I can't do my little flip in the war. It will flip What kind of sadistic Made to say you should be able to run out of missiles honestly It does seem about like that flight thing that flying dragon is massive and you're telling me they can't hold more than like 20 missiles. Oh Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Why are you holding that piece of paper? Oh What's the plan I'm not going anywhere near me We could use your help get that wall down and dig in I'm gonna do I'm gonna put down TNT As long as there's no boss fight, I couldn't be less of a rats or what fetch quest you send me on name your boss fights What is this? What is this armor? Protection down but everything else up. I think I'd rather protection up Just leave it leave it What's this? Right? What's the deal? What much I do? As long as there's no boss fight on the other side, I couldn't give the last of a rat I couldn't give the last rat Anymore If the goal was to make the count and pain memorable they should be sure succeeded Oh, I'd say more like miserable because Again, like literally the Navi instantly do that as soon as you injure them. They do their thing Except that one I guess Let's just let's navigate we're appropriate I don't know if I should just speed run it Can the make even go on the bridge that's up ahead? Oh Like this game parish definitely, yeah, thanks for that really appreciate that. Um Why am I being shot? I'm being chased. I'm being chased Um Oh, yeah, definitely happy to replay that's true brotherhood not happy to replay The Navi side yay fun the RDA side. Oh my god I think I've almost got two revives, but I don't think I have a boss fight anymore I think this is literally just Spring pray from here on out Oh That's a lot of Navi and they're probably gonna destroy my make-up. I'm not careful Where's BT when you need them honestly? I Might get out for that RDA dangerous, but I'm like it seems to be I just want a few revives on hand Oh, right. I've got two revives now As long as I can choose a hate thing if there's a fight ahead. I Just hope this oh my god, my mix Well, look at me. Let's just go for it I Right just go keep going Just like there's fates all the way up ahead We need BT Honestly sorry for reason the idea of RDA, but thank you for experience in it Thank you for experiencing the pain. I mean some people enjoy when streamers rage. I don't know I Got taken out in viz for that like some people genuinely love when streamers rage and I'm like Hold off the Navi. No, you are not gonna make them literally I don't know how freaking strong you think I am I am not that good. I that's Okay, I'm gonna try and keep a lid on it and not get overwhelmed very quickly. I am so glad I picked up the other RDA I can't do anything Yeah, I'm gonna need you guys I Need everyone to start spamming needs everywhere because I'm pretty sure those are RDA needs I'm gonna need everyone to do that unanimously unanimously right now It's not it's okay, just sacrifice me in the fire Oh, and I'm taking out in viz, which is the only time it helps to redo my Okay, I feel and then the damage protection to tell I can get my heal back up I need long range Our bombs, okay, those are definitely our needs. I feel like if the Navi were doing needs like that, I'd be a goner already Okay, okay, we're not overrun But don't want to jinx it, but I'm gonna grab that it's really important I'm really jinxed it but it's looking good only a minute 30 of this and then we're done Okay Protection on I don't really want to make me too much I'll take Okay, I don't know every spamming needs to keep doing that shit. Oh my god It's literally sunlocking them from hitting us. Oh, that's a lot. That's a lot. Hold on. Oh Dear I think I think maybe some of our soldiers went down because we're getting no, okay now we're overrun again If I can just whittle down some base health on them, it just makes all the world is different Oh, we might actually have three roses. Oh, I'm getting sunlocked my pardon I'm not that mad because I'm actually getting help like genuinely getting help and like they're not all all On to me it's when they all all often there's like nothing I can do hold on sorry Because I'm too busy freezing the game for not being absolutely I take it back Why do you fill out your pistols every time why do you insist on filling out the pistols? Well, I hope it didn't die because of that freaking cutscene Oh Is mercy up by the way, I think mercy may be alive. I may have completely missed it during my reach Oh Oh Okay, no, so they are still attacking whatever but I mean I'm getting left them own devices. I'll take it Danger danger danger high voltage. Okay. Mercy is live. Yes. Uh, monster. Welcome to link her. We will redirect into her I think we're almost done. I am going for a nap after this stream. I can tell you that much Wow Mercy's region. Yeah, if you want it, I don't know you'll need to see who reaches more me or mercy Oh, I'm done I can sense it I'm licking the screen right now Almost done You know, that's what I'm talking about now. We can take it to the room You need more than enough One reach stream to the next return to your dragon and fly to the well of souls. We've done it The evil has been defeated. I will never I'm very happy to say I will never play the rda side again Oh, uh a rank rotten experience Dev team do not speak ever again and do not cook ever again Thank you and good night. That's my review Forward a little to the right The gamer region real I was just it was just rinse and repeat rinse and repeat in the moment. I've got even uh A hint of damage a lick of damage to speed things up. Uh, either new guys were brought in Oh, it is I actually have a health bar just Definitely shouldn't be taking these corners too willy-nilly then I'm gonna start showing you but I can't help but find out whole when you're angry. Oh my god. I feel like that would be terrifying I'm making that PP shrivel up and go back and save me. I'm just gonna be terrified If I was on the receiving end of that Same here it's kind of what no Oh, my god. Sorry. Sorry women moments Looks partners bad boy Right we did it we have confirmed the evil Is the game gonna let us get there without being attacked by a plan Oh No fighting here or I'm gonna cry. I'm gonna angry spot is more. I'm sorry so but terrifies mommy Right oh Oh Oh I'm going Listen to you The new recruit fresh from earth. I've been working on this for over 10 years This is my moment right now. So if it doesn't work I'll see you on the other side. Oh wait. I have to I need to end him anyway Oh Well, this is gonna be beautifully satisfying Just let me cook a bit. Okay. It's fine. He has a belly. He's allowed him But yeah, it's just gonna be satisfying all things considered. Actually, you know what I could probably put on that double aggression thing Preserver. Yeah, let's do that Okay, that's fine Oh, he healed up I'm not sure I can send it to you healing up. So don't do that again Okay, I kind of like some walking and more I'm not gonna lie That's okay. He doesn't really seem to do anything. It seems like he blows Hmm I'm just giving him it. I'm just throwing everything out. I'm hold on a minute Oh, wow, so the sonic pulse is too far away none. Okay, he's full healed again Now sadly I am going to run out of ammo doing this method So not really sure what's supposed to happen It's fine you're allowed to do that, but maybe don't heal again Um Um, am I supposed to do something special for this fight? I don't know how many heals you get. If you get like five and then the game's like, okay, no more heals for you Well, why did the aim do it? Uh, is there like a ammo station? There was one back there. Uh, I'm literally out other than my shorty Oh I'm not like mad at this fight or anything, but like bro you keep healing like there's nothing I can do I don't like You use my mortar strike on him I did nothing to him Hello Um I'm a bit confused. Sorry. I need to change out my weapons because they're all empty. So I can't the nail gun sure Uh, it's already full me and there's no point in making it at flame doors or Uh, machine gun? I don't know. Okay. Oh, this one's different Okay, nail gun again All right, healed again I don't know if I'm supposed to call upon Awa to do something The utility looks like it's less literally sneaking on. I guess he's just a damage on Wait, just go to the glowing thing The thing back here No, it's a bit of a glowing thing I'm Blowing Sorry, I'm brain I'm both brain dead. I'm bling bling thing I'm looking But yeah, I'm starting to think I'm needing to like call upon Awa to like end him because I'm literally like swimming right now. Excuse me. I tried to go for a wee swim before I ended you I'm just gonna like up on Awa. Oops. Sorry Oh Blowing I'm definitely not to claim Awa right now glowing I thought that stick. I mean that stick is glowing. What the fuck it is I Warning de synchronization imminent honestly, can you bring him to a ledge? I feel like I'm supposed to do something here I think it's broke. Okay, so I watched a quick video and the guy He uses a green angel. Oh greening greening launcher. Okay Is this a grenade launcher? I only have 20 on the grenade Oh Oh, wow, really? Okay after all of that bro I'm starting to think this shit wasn't playtested at all past this point Are we the baddies All right Um, yeah, let's see where the baddies all right Ryder you there colonel quarch Analyst is going like a baseball stadium. What the hell did you do? I'm not sure Whatever you did it worked, but now we are making a quick retreat. I'm getting reports. They lost control of their band cheese That makes sense to you. Yeah It actually does Congrats Ryder. You're gonna be a hero for this I'll get your butt down here and that dragon better be spotless. He had damage on the dragon Eat that you grace. I heard we lost Kendra, but you need to know you did the right thing I hope it was all right This better bring peace. You've stopped a catastrophe, but this isn't over We can't keep control available for long nor should we and we've got more shit of humans do to arrive More is inevitable. So what was this all for? A we needed to see what we're not there being part two spoilers from the movie in the video game Next time she'll be ready Am I here Development team should be ashamed of yourself for the rda side Development team should be proud of yourselves from the navi side. Don't ever make me do that again. That's awful Oh my god I have no idea how hard I reach because I can't remember in the moment But oh my god Am I going mental or was that terrible? I think I must have I think I should have been using the grenade launcher clearly from that last fight and and because I didn't use the grenade launcher and It just got from like bad to worse or You blacked out when you raised. I don't remember really what I just remember like I did get angry But I don't remember anything that actually happened like one minute I was like getting annoyed and then the next minute the fight was over and I got stuck on a rock and I was trying to get down A grenade launcher is op. Okay, I guess that's probably you're shouting quite a bit I'm cheeky. Bye She literally saw red. Honestly. It was beautiful. Monka is you're rage is hot, but the mission was bad Angry girl, you were fuming at the man. I was frothing for mama. I clipped it. So show up one stream and it's Monka I don't even know. Am I going to be embarrassed if I look back on it like I don't feel that bad right now So kind of been that bad The game got dunked on hard and forgotten pretty quickly, but for the general community for a lot of good reasons At least you finished it. You deserve a good rest. Good girl. I'm proud of you for not driving up The rage has talked to your content. Well, that is literally why I do not play rage games like mercies unironically so brave For playing that game. Like I couldn't I'd just be scurrying and It may be a bit embarrassing, but at least it seems to have been for a good reason. I felt that rage. It's so funny Also, you might want to make more tea before sleeping or after waking up or for my voice I mean, it felt like a justifiable rage or he just won't make us cause the rage was justified. Okay Congrats. You did good job thing So you need more than an app. You may need to fill it. Oh, I hope I can get like a full eight hours. I've been needing it for a while Hmm, you didn't give up. So you did a good job at least. Heck yeah Mad cause bad. Lamar true. Literally all I had to do was pull out the grinny launcher apparently Lucky me Lucky me. All I had to do was pull it Take these head pads I would have went insane. You're amazing Well, then I feel like you guys probably would have figured out to swap to the weapon way before I did so Sending hugs if they're welcome. Otherwise you did so good. I'll take those hugs Are you the first person to finish this campaign on stream? Stop imagine if I was like the first vtuber to play this game. That would be hilarious And and the pov is like isn't the navi side amazing and then the rd side is me just screaming Sorry for forcing you to play that. I feel bad now. Nah, come on. I can stop at any time I just say stilettos and then I would stop. Don't worry If you're the first that counts as a world record, I would have thrown my monitor before changing weapons making vtuber history So when an angry scot rages. Oh, so wins the angry scotch rages somewhere on the floor I'm pretty sure you are though. Oh, no, I'm what sorry. I've already I've already forgotten what I'm probably would have overgranted Before and killed it with a bigger number. You're probably the only one that ever will you can be the avatar of youtuber The way of the water the way of the scot You did great powering through that heck. Yeah, think about it. You used the worst weapon to beat the game. Honestly I actually think you are the first vtuber to do answer every shipper history Not even a weekend after debut and i'm already making history But see fully the rda was a lot more fun than the navi Why because of the rage apparently everyone's got you know, half masked at the moment because they liked my rage The way of the scot the cut fish the way school and You have a full monopoly on this game now. Okay. Okay. I'll take it. I'll take it I'm the type to pause the game and watch a video spin feeding me on what to do Honestly small streamer did two years ago, but for both campaigns. Yes half half Now i'm going to get the game to relieve or to relive the pain You can't me Yeah, let's say half only half wait, there's no way i'll need to make a rage ASMR if that's okay I don't mean suffering like that Like honestly, I feel fine now, but I guess in the moment. I was like scary region Sorry if I scared anyone. I apologize Got some ancestral rage build up in me, I guess Me just skipping 60 percent past all the enemies honestly 60 percent probably like 100 percent of the optional fights i skipped like i'm not even kidding Now you scare us more. No, you didn't scare You could do it more. You're like, well, I do have a Donut's lawn reward potentially being that rage, but yeah Stormy rage should be like you call that a willy. That's just prophetic, you know That was uh, that wasn't scary. It was the opposite. Oh the fabled Scottish rage I mean, I was scared and felt something else at the same time. I'm not gonna explain. That's actually hilarious I didn't know that had that effect. It makes me remember the banshee scream. Oh I'm not sure I can even banshee scream Like I can do it. Like my screams very loud, but I'm not gonna scream because I I think after the rage, I don't know if one of the neighbors will probably try to listen in on me right now And be like what is going on Angry hypnosis ASMR Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. I still prefer subspace Just yelling get up Right, um, they're gonna call the police on you. I've actually wondered if it's a possibility I did speak to my neighbors at one point And I explained to them that i'm a voice actress So if they hear anything at night, don't be too worried. It's just me So my voice acting's a bit different Um, can you make a reward that you just scream Scotland forever Scotland forever Passive aggressive ASMR guys. They're like, is she okay in there? Does she need help? If someone clip that moment the clip will get but will get pretty Oh the toothbrushing I'm gonna go get my toothbrush. Okay I'll be right back. We're gonna if you want to get your toothbrush and brush your teeth Before we go off-stream you can most certainly do it I Got one out of 21 days to brush our teeth Like let me put my headset on so I can listen to the Thingy right. I've got my toothbrush. It could be a sound pack from morning alarms. Just full bag pouch I have toothpaste because I salivate a lot. I don't know about you But whenever something enters my mouth, it starts to salivate like crazy We're gonna brush our teeth and then we'll read into Yeah, mercy. I was gonna call her mousy for a second. What she ate a mouse? Are you ready? Are you ready to brush your teethies With me I'm gonna do it for two minutes. Okay. That's how long you brush your teeth So just start with the front of your teeth, right? I see you.

Oh, but just kind of came out Kind of just came out I said what everyone was thinking and saying But uh, yeah, that game needs a hot patch for weapon drill. That's all I'm saying It won't let me open the redirect thing. Why not? YouTube you're so stinky sometimes it won't let me load so I can redirect into mary. I need to wait for it to load Okay, I did it now Oh tomorrow we have old school runesgate. Oh, I need to make my account But what do I call my account is the question? my meaning customization redirect add A difficulty right into mersey say Mersey Good better work Because Right my little reeflings. I honestly didn't think we were gonna. I honestly thought we're going to end out four hours but we've made it to almost 10 hours! Look at us go. You guys have so much stamina. Wait, wait, can I try this out? Hold on, I don't know if I can try this out right now. Is this gonna work or is this gonna break? You did so well. You make me so proud. You made such a long, unending stamina for me. Did it work? Did it work? Did I have a reverb effect when I did that? I don't know if that worked or not, or did I mess it up. What do you mean, look at your skull? You're the crazy one who took stuff. I'm feeling like it is. Yeah, the reverb was like, yes, it worked. I'm so happy. If my voice wasn't so burst, I'd do a bit more, but it's burst right now. Big burst, big burst. All hail the glowfish. It looks good when my eyes and my little shells, you can kind of see the transparency of my shells a bit better like this. Maybe you can see my reflective thing going on. It works, so wait, talk a bit. Okay, I'm glad it worked. Right, I am going to end it there without a fantastic endurance room. Tomorrow is old-school runescape, so just so you know the plan, the plan is that I'm going to make a new fresh account. You don't have to, but my idea was that we do some questing to level up, and then we basically just have fun leveling up cooking and see where it goes. But I'm a bit rubbish at quests, so it would be nice to try them together, like Cook's Assistant. I'm sure there's a Vam, that haunted house quest. I can't remember its name right now, but we're going to do those kind of questings, and then we can do some fishing together, and we'll cook the fish outside of the barbarian village, because that's free, and we can cook crayfish for free. I'm pretty sure you just need to get a net. Are you doing members? I think so, that's my only issue. I'm going to buy membership, but I'll play, like I'll go into a free-to-play lobby, and we can do the free-to-play quests, and take it from there, because I'm not entirely sure what the plan is after that. I joined you on old-school RuneScape Sheebie. I hate to break it to you, my name's Ronnie. My own tags level drain hypnosis. Yes, RuneScape membership. Time to make my account tonight too. Yes, I'll share whatever we're on, and we can all go questing together, and we can see all the reefling gang gang. I'm tired, it's pain. I know, I know what you meant. I need to go sleep. The fangs are so much easier to admire this school. Yeah. Some people thought they were vampire fangs, but they're not. You can't really see my ears, but they're slightly pointed. No, pointy ears. I haven't played in ages, I need to learn. Yeah, we can all get like the same level. We can all like hack the same yew tree when we're trying to level up our woodcraft. Are you planning on playing something that follows 76? I think that's multiplayer, but I don't know how to get you in my lobby. Like, how do I get reeflings in the lobby? Or is it like, can we make a lobby code, and it's like a server like they host? I'm not sure how 76 works. Get bit by the fish, you wonder why? Would you let me bite you, reefling? That's terrible, you should let me do it. Love your choice of games so far makes me safe to see where else you got blood. Well, I'm glad you like the game so far. I'm literally just picking childhood stuff and stuff that makes me happy. So I'm glad. But yes, old school RuneScape definitely might be a recurring multiplayer for a little bit. I'm not really gonna, I'm not sure what happens when membership, what membership streams are planned. I think we'll also do, I think three membership streams a week possibly. One for react movie, one for membership multiplayer. I'll decide. Like, I wouldn't do like progression on old school RuneScape multiplayer behind a membership stream because that's not fair for those invested. So maybe, maybe, maybe. I first played again yesterday for the first time, used old school RuneScape, and a goblin got you, you got done at Goblin Village. A Dead by Daylight member stream? Yeah, I'm open to these kind of things. But yeah, one, I want to consistently have a member stream when membership's open. A react Andy, like we'll watch a movie together. And then I might also do a script writing stream. Or maybe show you some behind the scenes stuff, like maybe we write shorts. I don't know. I'm trying to think of like stuff you guys want to see. And then of course, we could just like maybe smaller games that aren't necessarily stream worthy on main. So for those of you who are unable to membership, please don't worry. I always have free content coming out and I for days, like so you know how we played needy streamer overload yesterday? Because it was only two hours long, like that's a short game. I would then come back online after maybe like a 30 minute rest and then do a membership stream. So you still get like content that day and then like I'll raid into whoever's online and like keep going. So yeah, don't worry. She streams eight days a week. Yeah, don't ever worry. And like obviously the ASMR comes out as well. That's like free on YouTube. You can watch on YouTube anytime. Script writing stream or submit scripts? Yes, it would be a bit hard to review scripts live because I would need to use euphemism and stuff. That's nice as long as you're not overworking yourself. I will make what I can handle and we can take it from there. Yeah. Get that Hermione to rewind time and overlap herself streaming honestly. True. True. I'll need to see eventually you'll be able to close your eyes and see her for a moment and you're out watching. Yeah. Always on that. There are always streams. So yes, please never worry if you don't have the money for membership because I stream every day and you can come see me every day. And yeah, I'll make sure everyone gets their money's worth either way because I don't like when streamers don't get their money's worth. Sorry, I don't like when streamers don't get their money's worth. So that's just me. So yeah. Strony is a streaming beast. I'm sure she'll have something for you. Yeah, I've got something for everyone. Or that's the plan anyway. Hopefully I got something for everyone. So you're saying is I should never become a member. Only if you are financially capable. And if you're only financially capable to support one person, I recommend doing my daughters over me. Okay. Because I always have free accessible content. Always coming out. So yeah. We love you, Strony. Please don't try my blood bliss. Yes. You're such a good girl. I will skip meals to members. Stop. No, we're not doing these jokes. I don't actually don't like these. There was like one joke that was like, oh, I'm like in a homeless shelter. And then I've given you like membership or whatever. I'm like, no, it's actually probably I am like so goofy and non serious all the time. Those kind of jokes are like, I don't like them. I sold my kidney. You definitely have a few streams that I need to rewatch. I love it though. Oh, they're long streams. You'll be rewatching for a while. But I'm good for putting on in the background for a rambling. If you ever like, I need I want to listen to something in the background, but I don't want to actually focus in. Yeah, just put the avatar stream on. And then when it comes to the RDA part, we're going to start screaming my head off. My, my, my scarier. But I'm looking forward to your first asterisk. I hope YouTube doesn't do anything. I'm a bit worried, but I'm not going to be doing ear licking or anything like that. I don't know what the heck YouTube's been playing at recently. It's making me nervous to even upload my like 1000 rewards. And there's literally nothing wrong with that fricking audios. Well, I just made a brand new or school roadscape. It's been years and I look forward to it. Yay. I will tell everyone the server when we get on tomorrow. Like I'll put it on screen and I'll say like, this is the world that we're in. And we'll start outside Lumbridge Castle where the starting point is. I'm literally going to make an account, put membership on it and then I get online for stream and we'll take it from there. I don't know what to name myself. So I need to name myself something mildly humorous, but I haven't decided yet. Maybe Scottlefish. That'd be nice. Oh, no, someone, someone. Ah, well, if you take my name, it's fine. I don't know. I'll need to think of something. Do you have a place where you'll upload? Monies for Vegemite. No, I don't have to try Vegemite. I'll get Vegemite then for the hand cam stream. Thank you reluctantly saying I'll get Vegemite in freaking toast. I don't even buy bread. I don't even get buy bread. Scottlefish is a good one. Thanks. I stole it from a leafling. Thank you for giving me that. Wait, do we need a membership on old school runescape too? Not necessarily for what we're going to do, but I think if we, I don't know yet. Like I don't know. We're going to do some quests, but I'm pretty sure like everything's behind a freaking lock and it's so expensive for old school runescape membership. I don't know if maybe there's a rich reefling that's willing to buy bonds and gift it to reeflings, but that's not like my place to ask for. It's a bit. I don't know if we have any try hard reeflings on old school runescape. Like I think I have about 12,000 coins in those runescape, so I can't buy anyone a bond. Sorry. And I'm starting on a fresh account. I don't know. Maybe we can like pull our money together to buy bonds to like share to reeflings. Will there be, you're looking on Patreon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're looking on Patreon. It's not a problem for me. Do what we want on Patreon. Do you have a place where you upload words that you asked that and I read that out and then I didn't even reply to you? No, well, the girls have been using Twitter and like putting a go, like a download link out. Um, I don't think any of my content is going to get taken down because I know the rules. I know how to scare them. Um, so I don't think we're going to any any Oilers in chat, literally any old school runescape Oilers. We summon you. I'd like to call upon you. My membership is still six dollars because I've had an active substance. Wait, you lock in the same subscription price because you did it all the way back then, but then you do that you're looking anyway. I can look this way. She knows the cheese. Strone is never touch runescape. Unfortunately, it's like a really, it's not a hard game. It's literally point and click. If you wanted to try it for the first time, you can always start up with us. But if it's not for you, you don't have to play along. It's okay. Please don't worry. I know you've been going for nine hours. That's crazy. Look, I'm just going to yapping. Okay. I mean, I could check out Marshmallow and we can make it to 10 hours if you want. Like I could put my little Marshmallow link in the chat. Ah, hee hee hee hee. Hee hee hee hee hee. Oh, my Marshmallow's in the description. Hold on. I even have, I can't even see my screen right now. My stream, not my screen. I can see my screen because it's right in front of me. Um, but hold on. How did I do this? How did I put it in chat? I am about to sneeze. Boom. Oh no. Oh no, it'd be such a shame if you guys asked me questions to round this up to a 10 hour stream. Stop. Stop it. We're right on the verge of 10 hours. Oh, we'll count down to 10 hours, shall we? Only four minutes left. Oh, I have a lot of Marshmallows. Whoopsies. Someone says, I'd love to spread your cheeks in liquefaction. Oh, I wasn't supposed to read that part out loud. Hey, I'm glad you do. God, your salty gamer rage makes me want to have hard, sweaty, angry stuff. I can't read that one either. Um, Hi, Stormy. Hopefully you're well. This is my first time using Marshmallow. Glad I could pop your Marshmallow, Cherry. I don't know if you read any of these. Oh, I read all my Marshmallows. I have a few questions. You stream so much that I'm wondering if you'll be taking a break from ASMR. No, I'm streaming ASMR in two days. No break from ASMR. I've got ASMR cards coming out as well. I just need to write the scripts and send them off. Let's go again. Yeah, I've got time for ASMR all the time because, yeah, I also got loads of managers in place. So the only thing I need to do really is be the messenger owl that sends clips to editors now and uploads stuff on behalf of the girls. Like, Mercy just wakes up and she's like, got new shorts on her channel. She has no idea. That's me doing it. Actually, Emmy has another, is that short? Yeah, Emmy has a short and she's just going to wake up and it's going to be on her channel. Already tagged up and everything for her. Yeah. Unless I didn't read that right. Yeah, I know how my ASMR is going to be. I can also upload full videos to Twitter as well if anything ever did become an issue. Like, if I did a little ASMR video. So it's not a problem. The level organization is astounding. I saw the girls aren't stressed. If the girls had to stream and they had to run around and worry about trying to get clips out and shorts out, not good combo. Not nice. Not nice. Oh, no, wait, what? Hi, Stroni. Feel a bit embarrassed. Oh, no, it's okay. Someone says they feel embarrassed because they messed up in chat at some point. Don't be silly. You're allowed to mess up in chat all you want. I can't even write in English. Like, don't worry. Like, Emmy had a script where she had to say a putty cat and I accidentally typed P-I-S-S-Y. Like, don't be afraid of making embarrassing mistakes. They're not embarrassing at all. Actually, you only feel embarrassment if you let yourself feel embarrassment or something like that. It's something about psychology. Like, if you make mistakes. Yeah. Viewer girls trying to find a non-lid marshmallow and read on stream impossible. It's honestly not that bad. I don't get that many. I honestly don't get that many. Like, the girls show me what they get and I don't seem to get, but I haven't been using the other Twitter. I think once I start using it properly, then. Yeah. Question for you. The other day we talked with Castle Green Brotherhood about how you're the mother of the girls and the reeflings are the father. Does that make Emmy or a daughter or sister or a daughter or sister? If you're a reefling, then technically daughter or sister, but if you're not a reefling, then it's just a little sister. New audio idea. Anger Scots woman mounts and rides you after being all day as a fellow Scots nun. We're hotter than here and so on. So I listened to the Assassin's Creed stream and I was happy that you remembered me. I'm like, yeah, you're like the main clipper. I actually didn't ask that question. I think there was someone else who made a few clips as well. I thought I'd be making clips and posting them, but I wasn't too sure if I could use that. Oh, no, you can go. Brother, that's your channel. You own it. You make custom content. You have made new creative content. Then guess what? Copyright is in your favor. Don't worry about copyright, okay? You don't have to worry about copyright or are you joking me? Clip the girls away. Have fun. Have that ye. I'm friends with a guy who's already itching to draw the fan art. Fan art of who? What door? What door is getting fan art? Please tell me. I want to know. I love seeing them get fan art. I like with the Olympians better, better not think about the family. What type of hypnotism is your favorite? That's too hard to answer, honestly. I like hypnoloss. I really like hypnoloss, where I'm supposed to hypnotize you, but they're backfires and I do as you say. Ah, so good. Any chance of a spiral let's play? I've never played spiral like that before. I would like to try it. I'm pretty sure they remastered them and they're like nice, calm, friendly, casual. It seems like something that's like cameo-esque, where it's like nice and simple to get through, so I think yeah. Hmm. I would say yes overall. It's the one where you go into like a difference or am I- am I messing up for subspace? I may mess you up for subspace. Hold on. Hey, story. I'm probably being a dumb dumb and I haven't found them yet, but I was wondering if you could get reference sheets for all the girls chat mascots. Yes. Amy's chat mascot is in her debut stream. You are the light in my dark. You are the beating in my heart. I showed you yesterday. I should get a reference sheet from them all put together. Maybe I'll get a tweet from the bee alone. Hmm. I can't because Amy's is in a different art style. Hmm. I know what you're asking for. I don't know the best way to do it. Maybe the discord can post them. Maybe the discord should have a reference sheet for all the girls and their mascots. That might be the solution that we can come to. Would you like to come together on a solution? Or would you like to come together? Hmm. I'm a little late but congrats on the debuts. Can't wait to see you and the rest of the girls having store. And it was nice hearing her Scottish momay again. Glad you're back. Sincerely a H little Rajesh boy. Oh yeah. It's good to be back terrorizing you. I cannot wait. I cannot wait for the A's in my stream. Thanks for being so funny, amazing and cute. You make my day better in all its aspects. I wish for you and the girls eternal success. Thank you for such kind words. That's so nice. I'm glad you somehow found me funny. Because yeah, literally, yeah, it's not good. It's hard to make jokes. Okay, my first one. Oh yeah, there's an official discord that has notification only. None of the girls are in it. So remember what I said in debut 2.0. You don't groom us. We groom you. So none of us are in it. But if you want notifications for when we go live and all that. What does it say? I need to push you against the wall holding both your hands above your head. Uh, am I supposed to say this out loud? I don't know if I'm supposed to say this out loud. I don't think I'm supposed to say that out loud at all. By the way, along with the zinc supplements, I've started eating celery for you. Oh, celery is mingin, though. Thanks for your sacrifice. They taste between boring and bitter and I don't like them, but I'll persevere for you. Are you sure you eat? Even I draw the line at celery. Sorry. It's so tasteless. I don't understand how it was even. And that celery has been genetically selected to produce like that. The only way celery is redeemable is in a soup because it's got stock and completely covers the taste of celery. Your dedication is appreciated. Celery sucks. Celery is a peanut butter delivery device. Oh, like a spoon. Celials worse though. I'm going to zail them up, form down. Hold on, I'm just grabbing some water. I need to hydrate. I have been hydrated. Oh no, it's 2pm already. Oh, it's my bedtime soon. Oh no. Wait, no. Actually, it's good that it's my bedtime soon because that means I get to be on old school Rinscape with you even. Wait, actually, I just realized we're doing a first freaking stream snipe game tomorrow. Oh my God. Why did that not register? We've literally been talking about old school Rinscape. We get to play our first freaking stream snipe and I get to see you all. Ah, oh my God. Okay, I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. Oh my God, it's tomorrow. I want to go to sleep right now. I'm not going to be able to sleep. It's like Christmas. It's like Christmas. I'm going to be so excited. Are we all going to like have code names? I don't know. Should we have theme names? Are we all just going to name our names like how we are? Five. I'm just going to see this right now. Someone says hopefully you will play five hours. Five hours? No, we're doing 12 hours. Okay, 12 hours or go home. So I'm going to give everyone as much of a chance as possible to show up in old school Rinscape. I will put the world we are on in the top corner or something so you can see it any minute. What is Rinscape? Rinscape is an old web game. Is that a web game? I don't know if it's a web game now. But yeah, if you have trouble falling asleep, just look in a mirror and hypnotize yourself. True. I'm aware that's below your average. The most Rinscape players average on the game. Oh, do they had enough after five hours? Me just like, right, let's do a fashion show. Everyone go to the Grand Exchange and get some pretty cold dawn. I'm going to rate who has the best. Oh wait, there's houses and can I bring you to my house in Rinscape? Right, I don't know how membership works, but I'm pretty sure you can get house in Rinscape because I remember watching someone play hide and seek in Rinscape and he was like chasing around like the people in stream. We can play hide and seek in tag in Rinscape. Oh my god. Yeah. And it has this one's go. Oh my god. Oh my god, could we play hide and seek? I want to be the seeker and I get to touch you all. And if you're touched, you have to like go in the corner until the winner is crowned. We really are getting crowned. I've never played Rinscape, but whatever hint you're describing, it sounds very close to Oji Cup Penguin. Oh my god, I want to play tag. And I'll be like, right, run away from, oh no, who's that? Oh no, but we won't be able to know who's that. So we can go to the hide and seek. Okay. Shawnee, if you phrase it like that, everyone will like touch them. No, no, you're not wanting to get caught. What if we use our Rinscape beds next to each other? I sadly can't start a new game. I already have three games that take full time and one of them I play. Well, World of Warcraft. Someone was like, well, I say something. They were like, I'm no longer doing wow raids to watch your streams. I'm like, no, your girls are going to be so annoyed at you. Like I've had the chance to play World of War. What was the expansion called? It was like the second last expansion of wow. And I had a chance to play it. And apparently, people role play in this place called Goldheim. And I'm like, should we play wow and just like be like really weird role players that I like. Shadowlands. I think it's Shadowlands is why played. No, not the battle. Not the battle about the dwarf. Oh, okay, brain needs to catch up. Hold on, hold on, brain needs to catch up. Not the battle of Azeroth. Goldchart and something like that. Yeah, the gold chart and we should all go role play there. I would like make like make people really uncomfortable and we're all just like role playing. Wow, ascension is a thing. I don't know what that is. The elf and her dwarves. Oh, wait, what would we be? Can I be a cute night elf and then you guys could all be wargans for some unwritten reason? Pop Tropica is still a thing too. Pop Tropica. Guild Wars 2 role plays were at, I don't know, Wink Wank? Really Wink Wank? Oh, wait, wait, wait, do that again. Wink Wank? Really Wink Wank? Did that, did that work? Oh, no, it doesn't work. Wait, for some reason the sound works on my freaking game. Hold on, we're like Wink Wank. Here we go. Wait, that played twice. I don't know why it doesn't do it on the screen. That's strange. It's the same instance. Oh well. Sorry, that took me so long to do. We should be orcs and you should be an elf for no reason at all. Oh gee, I sure wouldn't love to be overpowered. I take a drink of hydration of water. To hydrate. Hi, good morrow, dear silly cuttlefish. I'm very sleepy, so I'mma be brief. I absolutely adore watching yours. That's okay, shame! And today, and it's been so unreal to watch you be all silly again, I absolutely adore you and I hope all of you are girls and I absolutely adore you and your hopes for the veal or girls and everything and I hope you all make it happen for your happiness as mine and I'm always kicking my feet, blushing, tapping and stuff. Thank you for making, thank you for such kind words. Got you twirling your hair and stuff, huh? Got you twirling your hair and stream. Are you and the girls ever going to play Minecraft together? Yes, July is when the group Minecraft server goes up. Amy, definitely the most Minecraft-y out of us all. I don't know how the scale goes, but I'mma confidently say I'm probably the lowest on the scale of like Minecraft knowledge. All I know is that apparently the mob votes are the vote, people voted for the freaking stealth phantom things. If you don't sleep for more than two days they attack you through walls and stuff and I know that was the mob vote and apparently the mod vote is also rigged because it doesn't make sense. I don't know, but I don't know if it's rigged. I think it's because people don't understand like kids will vote and kids don't vote for things that are like good. They vote for what kids want and maybe that's why the votes are always so skewed. Yeah, mob vote's terrible. I tried and voted for the crab. Wasn't there not like an alternative? I can't remember. I assume Mercy and her motion sickness might be a bit of a struggle. Yes, Mercy... I would love... it's hard. I don't know if Minecraft would set it off, although she can change the camera so it might not affect her motion sickness. I'll need to ask a bit more about it because I don't have it. I don't know what kind of like sets it off all the time. Kids running around... I can't believe it. Kids ruling the way that kids game isn't used. Terrible. I hydrate again. Oh my voice is feeling it Mr. Krabs. I'm pretty sure you can move out your camera angle. Can you not on Minecraft or am I just making that up? Does it look cool? Never stuck with him forever. Yeah, I will agree. The design of it looked cool but its actual thing in game is rubbish. Like rubbish. What does that mean? What are you asking me? Forgot to send this. Thank you mommy for all your girls. So cute. I wanted to mention that. So many people are like thanking me for like the girls being the girls. I'm like no, you thank the girls. I didn't do anything. If you're thanking me for picking them. Again, that's the girls that did that. It was through either their introduction or their own content. It's the girls. It's the girls you should be thanking. Not me, you goofy gobers. It's the girls. So thank the girls. The reason people say that the vote is rigged is because Compton created tell people to vote for a certain more. Therefore, I picked the vote. Compton. Compton. Who's Compton? Sounds like a town in London somewhere. Or a bottle. Sorry, a bottle in London. You picked an amazing bunch though. They're all awesome. I'm glad you agree. There'd be nothing short of perfect. As in they are perfect. That's how you say they're perfect, right? They're nothing. They have been nothing but perfect. Yeah. That's how you say it. Yeah. Okay. Man of heat and ghosts. Wait. Oh, no. Right. You guys are welcome to laugh. I think this is terminology I'm not familiar with. If I see a pest trooper, what's a hollow live home? What's a needy male? What? What's that? Am I being dumb? I don't know what that is. They're asking, do I have, am I able to shadow ban them? Maybe this, no. Maybe this, no. I don't quite understand it. Sorry. Why is someone sending me a detailed, no. Is this far and on? Is this toilet bowl far and on? Oh, ye gods, how I wish for that most delightful of noise to curl into mine deprived ears. With such intensity, I yearn to experience the sound of Strawny's splutter gutter as it flaps a flutter, the noise like a walrus burping up butter, the harps and splurts like a chorus of angels unleashing their art, the pungent bass bass that can only be played alongside golden harps to shepherd the dead whom has come and died when hearing Strawny's fart. That is so toilet. There's no way you're not toilet bowl and on. Just for very quick lore, someone ages ago sent me a thing and was like, I really want to hear you fart on the toilet and I'm like, what? You want it to be amplified by echoing off the rim of the toilet and from then he was crowned freaking toilet as bowl annulment. I don't want to miss what cursed filth hath the eye brought upon, hath the eye brought upon these lands. Hi, my love, I want to, hmm, in me right in front of you while you hold her hand. Careful what you wish for, you might be getting it. You might be getting it all the girls actually, possibly. There's, hmm, yes, I need to, I need to see you. He wants to hear the reverb full acoustics, literally. Well, they wanted to hear that chock. You're only allowed to hold hands with the harps, even better. I have a plan for my Dora Thon, but it requires a team effort and it's quite a lot to ask the girls like, oh, Dora Thons are like, you need to help each other out, type them, but I'm going to try my best to make it as easy as possible. But I would like to release a certain audio and basically, in it, I give you a pill that negates any need for a pause champ, if you will. And then I take you door by door. It's so messed up saying how loud. But yeah, and I tell you like all the good things and encouragement. I need to, I need to let it cook. Okay. I need to let it cook. And I need a Dora Thon in the first place to even start cooking it up. But we ain't there yet. We ain't doing that. We aren't even on that part. Well, that's a very silly pill. Lord, grant me strength. Would you please give us a heads up for when it comes out so we can save? Oh my God, mon. Please do that. She kicked a whole six course dinner. I'm a gourmet chef. Well, if I get 99 cooking on RuneScape, then yes, I am a chef. Confirmed. Any plans for haptic support? I keep getting asked, but I don't know what it is. I don't know what I need to do to the audience to make that happen. I don't know if it's like I run it through a data thing or what? I don't know. I don't know. I'm too dumb. Hold on, I'm gonna fix my calibration and I'm wiggling a bit too much. Okay, calibration, calibrate it. Are we cooking in RuneScape something? Yes. I don't know how to make money in RuneScape, but we're going to be buying lobster so we can level up. If not, we'll use Barbarian Village and we'll pick up all the salmon, all the bought strobe and cook. Shawnee, do you reply to marshmallows privately? No, I don't. I reply on stream or I put together a mosaic. A mosaic? Is that the correct word? Where I put all the pictures together and post it. But I've only done that once. I should maybe do it again sometime. And then I can talk about all the naughty things. Why? Here's a funny story about three medieval kingdoms. I'm scared to click on this piece. Hey, Staroni, I love your work. Any chance to do a belly button camsuit? No, you don't like to see my belly button. Why would you want to see my belly button? I don't like my belly button. Belly button? Belly button? Is that your choice? Is that your choice of finishing location? Hmm, your choice? Interesting. Good night, Staroni. Just thought you'd want to know I'm going to jet. I can't read the end of that. Enjoy your nighttime routine. Sleep well. Oh my. Oh my. Hi, Staroni. I want to hold your body again. Oh. I can't read any of these. There's a free game called Fantasy Star Online 2. I haven't played it in years, but every weekend there's a Hatsune Miku concert. That's so specific. Why is there a Hatsune Miku concert in the middle of Fantasy Star Online 2? I'm thinking Miku, Miku, Ui, Ui. Blue air, blue eyes, hiding in your wi-fi. Staroni, I just want to let you know for old school runescape, being on a member's world is almost a requirement for any skill training. You can quest together with people and free to play, but the gameplay is limited. Oh, but it's so expensive. Stop reading them out loud. Ah, I like reading them. It's only me, or is it me, seeing a lot more things than she would. Eh? Are they both on? No, they're not online right now. You mean in the ASMRs? People are bored. Bold on Marshmallow. Yeah, that's the best part. They tell me everything they want, and I give them everything they want. That's a good exchange. Can you please say... What are you gonna use it for if I say it? And you didn't tell me what tone to say it in either. You didn't tell me what tone to say the sentence in either. I need to think. How would you want me to say it? Mmm, I lost the game. This? Is that the tone you wanted this? If you want me to say something, you need to give me tone. You need to give me the emotion. Wait, strong enough. Wait, what? What? Wait, is that that goofy game where if someone says you lost the game, you've lost us? Wait, is that what it? Rip game players. Wait, what does it mean? It's a silly game, right, where people say I lost the game and then you lose it until you win it on your streak? If you think about the game you lost, okay. The only objective of the game is to not think about the game. Oh, okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just made you all lose. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking that far ahead. I'm sorry. I didn't think that far ahead. Can I suggest something secret totally say so confession maros to read on stream? Yeah, you can like, you can literally type in the maros right now. Can I send it like this? Did that work? It did. Yeah, you can just put it in there. And if you want me to say something, just put that emotion and then like, like quotation marks. I'll also take requests here in the ASMR stream as well. So if you ever wanted me to hear it, kind of whispered a bit on a different microphone, because this is an SMB7 I'm using. At least we lost this drawing. I heard about this like 25 years ago in elementary. My discipline. I'm sorry. Okay, I distract you. I will say other things. Did you see the refling zip up hoodie design? Maro, I send other deer. What do we bear? Oh, if you've got those, if you've got those kind of pictures, please send on Twitter. But I will say my Twitter tags are freaking working. I'm trying to find this freaking artwork on Smuttle and it doesn't show up. I don't know why it doesn't show up. What's your favorite type of hypnotic induction to use? I think, I like repeated pattern. Come to the ASMR stream and I'll show you what I like. Okay, deal. Huh? Are you going to show up? And I'll show you what I like. She will like. And people are going to judge me, but I like it. So I'll do what I like. Sometimes the Strony is a good girl. Hell yeah, a good girl. You, oh, I'm good at advertising. Okay, I'm in. I'm in. Hey Strony, here's the song. Safe for work, Mario. Do you have a throne? I do, but I've unlinked it because I have everything I need now that I've got my reef links. I don't need a single thing else. And that's the 12th. I don't need anything. So I've unlinked my throne. I'm going to say how many triples have you received so far? Um, not a lot. The girls are getting a lot more than me. I think the reef links are a little shy, a little shy, a little scared. Will you and the girls be able to yourself and members streams? Most likely, yes. Strony, does it make you happy when people send you the spicy messages? Please let me. Please tell me all the scenarios you want to do to me. Are there any games where there's an alt path you haven't tried? I can't think of any off the top of my head. I normally probably like game starts, game ends. I never pick the bad team if there's a bad side. Stinky. Unless you count the companions in Skyrim. Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim? Oh wait, I'm on the fricking wrong thing. Sorry, hold on. Let me try that again. Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim? Yeah, exactly. That's what I thought. That's what I thought. No one likes them. Companion. Stinky. Yeah, exactly. You think they're fine? I don't, I never, although the first time you play it, it's like, wow, really good, but the fricking on Xbox, the girl always glitches out and disappears in the middle of the map and she never comes back. Hi, just a time waster for cute fish. Someone says, someone says, wife? Husband? Have you heard a joke about afar? It stinks. You know what? You're done. Wait, why? Oh, there's no background. No, no, no background. What's going on here? Why the heck do you know work? Oh, right, I think that's all the marshmallows that I can, I refresh and it's just gone up my quiver. Oh my god, I love you and the girls so much. I created a Twitter account just to follow the six of you. I hate that I had to turn into it. I know. Thank you for going through it. It's such a pain. My account keeps getting fricking locked and it keeps making me prove that I'm not bought over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Look, I just want to look at small fish. I want to, and then I want to go to sleep, you know what I'm saying? Hi, Johnny. Oh, sorry, I don't know why I gave you that voice. I'm so sorry. I apologize. Hi, Stronny. I woke up in a Euro time zone and found out the party was still going 10 hours in the avatar stream. Hell yeah. I really admire your energy and autism as you call it. Thank you. If you want to play old school RuneScape tomorrow, we are going to be live for 12 hours. Cheeky endurance stream. What's that? I stream more in one week than the average we should have done in a month. I'll wear that with pride. So I don't have snot coming out my nose. I'm drinking water. Your wishes. Hi, Stronny. Thanks for being a butt. So, okay. You can finish the rest. Stronny, guess what? You just took my marshmallow of engineering. Get plapped. Get plapped. Get plapped. Looking forward to the old school RuneScape. I also recommend Final Fantasy if you want more MMOs. Also, would you accept script ideas, fan-made scripts? Yes, I would. I don't have a problem. There may, at a later date, not now, not in this month, things need to settle where we can take official script submissions. However, if we are aware to take subscriptions submissions for audios purposes, sadly, you have to fully hand over the rights. So we have the right to monetize. We have ownership. We're happy to give credit. I think, I don't know if there's going to be a problem giving credit. I haven't thought that far ahead at the moment. But there's a lot of issues and it's quite a shame and it's really hard to iron out at this point in time. But once the dust settles and things get better. Wait, get plapped. What are you doing to us? Blap, blap, blap, blap, blap. Do you still have love for the big boy wiflings out there? I can't help but notice a lane in your lore video. Yes. There's just something I've got to say. You're as beautiful as the day I lost you. Oh, thank you. That's how to train your dragon. That's one of the only books I write as a child. I think I read like three books as a childhood. And one of them was how to train your dragon. I don't know how I read a book, honestly, but I did it. She's dunking us in the water. The books were so good. Literally one of the only books I read as a child. I've read more books this year than I have in my entire life, which is crazy. I'd pretend that I can do book reviews, but I'm not even smart enough for that. I'm currently trying to get through the Handmaiden's Tale. I actually am enjoying the Handmaiden's Tale. I'm like a few chapters in, but I don't know if people find this cheating, but I have to have the book read to me or I can't read it. This sounds really bad, but it takes up too much brain power to read the words manually, so I read along whilst being spoken to by TTS voice. And I can speed it up like super fast. Oh, thank you for the raid. How did your stream go? How did your stream go rain? Oh, you might be tired, so don't feel forced to talk. Don't feel forced to talk if you're a tired little barbie. I should have said background music. It's really quiet in the stream. I don't know if it's maybe nice. I hope your stream was good. Endurance streamer, creative director, and so has time to... I've not read any books since debut. I can tell you that much. But hi, Raiders. I'm Strony Cuttlews from Via Lure. I'm really inappropriate, so I do apologize if I'm new. You're a cup of tea, and I'm also Scottish, so I'm super hard to understand, but thanks for hanging out anyway. Which is... I hope your stream went fantastic. Please rest up after your stream. I'm sure you're tired, and last thing you want to do is get bombarded with loads of questions from the person you have kindly rated into. So I thank you kindly, rain cloud, and I hope you have a fantastic rest after your game. Game? Maybe that too. Never know. May not be a game. She may not be... Entry all in one breath. She's got lungs. Strony looking to push 11 hours at this rate. Should we? Should we just yap and then make it another 12 hours? Why is the raid message wait? Wait, I saw it as wait as well. Like, I could hardly read, but I had to scroll over. I mean, if I make another cup of tea, we could in theory make it 12 hours again, and we just like... And we can just talk, and I can ask you questions, and then you ask me questions, and then I'm going to ramble about something, and then you distract me. And then we're going to another ramble. Do you want that? Yes, please? Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. Her favorite form of introduction is tying you into the cannonball fall streak. The yabba-nay. You feel yourself getting so sleepy, don't you, little leaf-ling? Yeah, it's okay. Let's sleep and brace you slowly, okay? Shhh. And then here for 13 and then 14. I mark my words when and if YouTube ever fix VODs, 14 hour streams. Not even kidding. I can't get enough of you. I can't. I can't get enough of you. And when we do Elden Ring, I am incredibly tempted to possibly figure do a 12 hour and then raid into a six hour afterwards. I don't know. It's plausible. I'll be a tired bean. I don't know. I wish we could get 14 hours. 14 is the like perfect slot of like, I can still get a full night's rest. Lord, inject the Scottish lass. Lord, if you can hear me right now, inject the Scottish lass into my veins. Scott Fish is too powerful. Thank God it's daytime where I live. I don't have to sleep. Stop. I can't be more addicted than I am. You're too good, Strawny. I'm coming for you. Trying to kill us. Thank you. Do rest if you need to rest. Never worry, okay? Strawny, I've got to go to sleep. Can you please show us those pretty pink swirls? Oh, now that I'm so close to you, I absolutely can. Hold on. Uh, will I go in? Wow, I'm reacting to myself. Please don't react. There. Okay, that's more like me. Hold on. Let me put chat behind me just for a moment. Okay, let's see if I can do this properly. Sorry, I'm so close. Okay, let me move my water out of the way so I can at least attempt to do something mildly professional for once in my life. Okay? Once in my life, I did something a little bit. Oh, maybe a little bit. It's okay to be sleeping. It's been a while since you've rested. Well, really, okay? Shhh. Slowly, your phone. Slow, slow, slow. And your muscles relax. Slow, slow, slow. And your brain is quiet. Slow, slow, slow. Good name, but don't be stingy. Until the morning. Did I do it? Did I do it right? Slow, slow, slow. Until the slumber you fall, I tell you. I don't know if I was too close because I might hold. But I need to show her. Seems like you did. A little sleepy moment. Thank you so much. Good night. I just woke up. Can I put you to sleep again? You did great, good girl. You can't catch me off guard. I've already been called good girl. Good luck getting me in subspace. I'm in dumb space. When I do hypnosis, I feel very dumb. It's early in the morning. We need a bedtime ASMR. Absolutely. I am more than open to that. We can absolutely do bedtime ASMR. Am I allowed to go for a tinkle and a cup of tea as my voice is croaking like a frog? And then we'll just ramble until the 12 hours? Does that sound like a deal? You made my boss fall asleep. Super early. Hi, Stronny. Tanner is in... I'm getting a frog. Thank you very much for the tiff. I'm glad you liked it. Oh no, my Elden Ring. My stream elements is gone. So I can't freaking shoot you. Stream elements. Stream elements are so finicky sometimes. Oh, I'm already logged in. Go to my dashboard right now. Let's try that again. Shall we? My fraud, my fraud phone call. I can't believe that they're not getting any, not getting it from me. Thank you, Beryl, for the tip. I appreciate it. I'm glad. For our good dumb, keep it up, mom. Yeah. Right, I'm going to very quickly go make a cup of tea and do a quick tinkle. You are... I'm actually going to pin my... Rain cloud. Please rest well, rain. Okay. And sleep well. I'm not gonna force you to talk. Okay, I'm actually going to pin my... Any questions? Question mark? Did that work? Yeah, it did work. I'm going to pin it. So you're welcome to think it, but please rest well, rain. You work so hard. And you did fantastic. Hi, Stronny Tenors, Polk. Happy first week. This was my first rain. Oh my god, thank you so much. There's so kind of you. Oh my gosh. I'm glad I could take your rate, Cherry. Am I allowed to say that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I'm not allowed to say that, but I'm glad I could take it anyway. Okay, I've pinned that. I'm going to go make a cup of tea. I will be roughly three minutes because it takes three minutes for the kettle to boil. It takes three minutes for the kettle to boil, yeah? So you're welcome to ask me any questions of any variety. But please sleep well, rain cloud. Thank you for the rate. I really appreciate that. I need to add you on Discord, actually. I need DM, the whole Umi Plus squad, actually, and get everyone on Discord. And then once I have access to you on Discord, the possibility. Right, I'll very quickly mute and I'll go and make a cup of tea, okay? Okay, cup of tea time. Tea time. Oh wait, I'll do that. I'll close my eyes first. Oh wait, close eyes. I'm not very smart whenever I do that. Never mind. That time we brushed our teeth and I was like fully ready to go bed. Yeah, yeah, remember that time? Yeah, okay. I entered the room with a cup of tea. My tongue's sticking out. I was like, yeah, what time? Yeah. I mean, do we need a brush or two twice now? I don't know. You're not really supposed to brush it like too much. Yeah, I just got caught up. Apparently, shebe's alternative Twitter is over 10K followers, so what the heck just happened whilst I was streaming? I don't know what I've missed, but congrats girls, oh my gosh. Right, shall we? Shall we get to the bottom of it? Oh, she offered feet for 10K. Shut up. My toes are out right now. Hold on, I'm putting Goop on my toes right now for the money shot and everything. She has lovely feet. True. Yeah, she left the containment zone. Oh, okay, she componds, she componds. Right, let me refresh these marshmallows. Ooh, I got 20 more questions. Thank you for all the questions. Some reason it shows marshmallows from like a week ago at the top. I don't know what that means. Does that mean someone's verified is like put it up there on purpose? I don't know how it works. My stream disconnected. Why does OBS do that? I said OBS disconnected. I'm still here. Stream. You give me a heart attack every time you freaking do that. Please don't do that. Oh, I just get notifications that says OBS, you've disconnected. I'm like, please no. Please no. I'm trying to make it to the 12 hour mark, please, please. We're only one hour away. Someone said, oh yeah, you can request me to say stuff on my accent by the way. Someone says, please can you say ravioli in a seductive tone? Ravioli in a seductive, ravioli, ravioli, ravioli. That little sleep hypnosis thing you did was amazing. I'm convinced you'd be amazing at a meditation type sleep bottle. Yes, I want to do like bedtime hypnosis stuff as well, like completely like fine on the table. You haven't even started your hypnosis content yet and you're already infiltrating my mind by turning my internal monologue scotch. I can't wait for you to turn my brain into your bin, into your female doll. Oh my. Ever since you've debuted, I've gone from a man lost in a desert drawing of thirst to one drowning in a flood of nonstop good times. Yes. And all I want to do is just close my eyes and let the waves take me. Would you drag me into the depths? I want you to. I'm glad you can have good times here. It was, it was dry for a while but I hope, I hope it's good times here, good vibes. Yeah. We go swimming together, you know. I playfully dunk your head under the water a little bit. Just playfully. And no other reason. No other lower related reason. It was awfully cold in the depths but now we're in warmer waters I think you could say. Can you run from Prime Minister of Australia? So at least through, if it's bad ideas, it sounds nice coming from me but I've not even been granted rights into the country yet. There, there is a timeline where I get rejected and I can't, I have to go back to Scotland and I can't run the business. Let's hope we're not on that timeline. That would be terrible. Could you imagine if I got kicked out of, oh my god. Munga, munga. Uh, hi, Strony. I don't know if it's been answered already. It's okay to ask something you're not sure that's been answered. It's not possible for someone to be here all the time so please don't ever be afraid to ask a question you think that's already been answered. It's not possible for you to be here all the time. I know, I know it's terrible but it's not possible. Sorry if you did but I just want to know if you're interested in the game Lost Planet 2. It's on Xbox and I think you'd like it. Could easily play the whole thing in one stream. Also, you played Elden Ring. Would you be open to playing Armor Core 6? Armor Core 6 has been popping up over, I've heard the name a few times now. Love your streams that I can't wait to bounce those hypnotic eyes back on you. Stinky. Armor Core 6. I don't know what it is but it keeps coming up. Lost Planet 2. I should actually write down game ideas because I trust your guys's like suggestions over anything that I could possibly come up with. 8c6. It's phenomenal. It's great. It's really good. Highly rated game. Not my. Every strongy tone has it's synced up. No my default. I feel like my default and I'm like that and I'm all monotone. Like you can't even understand. Lost Planet 2 is an OG Xbox game. How did I never come across it then? I don't know when it came out. Maybe it was still at the stage where like so I used to get attached to one game and when Assassin's Creed Brotherhood came out like I hardly got any new games. I got Skyrim, I got Black Ops, AC Brotherhood and the rate of like new games like went down astronomically. If it's probes of 2006, 2008 and then Armor Core 6. I'll definitely, these games keep coming up and I trust your guys's judgment. Hi strongy, I was curious if you would follow guys's chat one day. Yeah, of course we're doing the jelly bean game. Are you silly? Are you being a silly sausage? Of course we're playing the jelly bean game again. How else are you gonna touch me and grab me and hold me back? You guys wouldn't stop grabbing me. You all grabbed me. You stinky stinker things. Ah my calibration is having a hard time today. Hold on. Let me re-calibrate. Hopefully my mouth stops wiggling. Okay it's not wiggling anymore. Jelly bean game. We do what? So in the jelly bean game you can like grab opponents and hold them back to like stop them from jumping to the objective or whatever and I used to have to beg. I was so bad at the game. I would basically have to beg till people would hold back to let me through the first level because I ended up losing it so many times that I wasn't playing the game and I respect it and you guys play because I was that freaking bad at the game. That is so much fun. So yes you will absolutely be playing that again. I will always do like a stream snipe game every month. One that's like public and one I do prioritize free to play games. Unfortunately I've started off a rune scoop which normally premium is the only way to play it so I've picked a bit pearly. I do apologize but I would like to get 99 cooking and it would be fun to kind of like achieve goals along the way. So going strong girls. Strony what type of fan are you like the most? Any. Like whatever inspires you. Like some people do like a meme funny moment. Like I uploaded a short and like in the short I was like and yes before you ask and I went back in the like the bagpipes and like the Scottish flag appear behind me and then someone liked it so much they basically made a Scottish beam come out of my mouth and like the first panel was me going and then the second panel was like I was like throwing this Scottish beam out of my mouth and it reminded me there's a trend on how it's the Mika world and she goes Mika no no this time you've been waiting for see two one Mika Mika beam and it reminded me of that and it's so good. Like whatever you enjoy like if you enjoy meme make a meme if you enjoy the other side of things you're more than welcome to make the other side of things because I like that stuff too. And yeah like anything 10 hours deep let's go yeah we're gonna make it a 12 hour stream uh so I'm just ranting ranting rambling for the last uh hour hour last hour. I've got a little cup of tea don't know if you can hear my nails on it. I'm just waiting for it to cool down before I can sip it. Stroney any chance of you making a 2D platform video game in the future that's so specific why are you wanting to bounce on me in 2D? I'm I'm not making a video game no. I have plans to make video game in the future but that's the future future like now meow. What should a lad do if he makes a fan made album? What should uh sorry make a fan made album? What should he send us general or art? What does that mean? Fan made album? Album? Like a music or am I being dumb? I'm in it for the long haul today I'm here we go I'm oh please don't stay up if it's gonna be bad for your health I don't want you to do anything bad for health okay see me I can be up for 12 hour stream because you know Rottos and Mirona a rap stuff oh my god can you do a diss track on me? Stroney cuttles more like Stroney can't make her mind up. Uttles on her 15th persona. Muttles got tape on her tape the only reason she's a VTuber is to give herself boobies because she ain't got any in real life yeah whoo diss tracks Stroney diss track no the diss tracks yeah that's right you're getting diss tracks again oh I just punched my knuckle against the desk by accident someone says I kneel you are too powerful so much kneeling I like it do it again it is humbling to know someone like you exist I've never dumped so much ink before within a span of a week and from it so happy from watching you and the girls I hope for your success and it's one of the few I feel that is deserved oh thank you so much thank you for spilling your ink I do like hearing about ink spilling like why yes maybe I am a V sucky after oh maybe there is sucky by blood the pause after hearing where I live it smells like freshly baked cookies because I'm near a cookie factory and I'm and I'm already awake for today we're still going strong oh that's dangerous for your health it's dangerous to be awake for more than like 16 hours I think is when it's bad like your brain function your cognitive function goes down like big big I knew it velar is going to be my oval my version of meet the grams will be meet the indulgers what did you think about the generation name indulge because if I told you technically if I told you a secret this is a secret for only who watch this stream right now um gen one's name indulge plays into gen two and three um and if we do get to three gens oh I'm gonna be so excited because to reveal the full names because they all play into each other and I'm so excited I wonder if anyone could guess I don't I think it's impossible to get there's too many variations like someone says is there a chance for a stream of a software game other than Elden Ring I don't think I can get any help in the other Elden Rings though however I think she be as interested in Bloodborne but unfortunately I'm not very good and the reason I like Elden Ring so much is because you guys can come in and help me but I'm not good on my own um three gens worth the tubers I will become a husk I'll become a husk honestly maybe we can guess after the second gen um oh no you can't guess it because there's two secret words that aren't present it it forms a sentence basically all three gens perform a sentence that perfectly encapsulates won't be where it is indulge marionette and you're like nah yeah you're no the secret words makes it impossible just wanted to drop one more marrow I've watched all the velo girls and well I like them a lot you're my oh thank you are you sure I'm your oh she though like I'm not gonna say anything but like Emmys T's and Oof A.C's accent like I'm not killed and she sounds so fucking adorable and her accent I wish I could copy it but I can't why is she irish I see why are you irish I don't know I just love the way she sounds but I feel like I'm doing a terrible that's terrible you have your own accent power power sure well the sentence will look good but what gen no I am not I am absolutely not doing any further so there some people were like are you doing a spin-off gen are you doing like a safer work variation no I've absolutely no interest I am exhausted I took so much HP damage getting gen one out I am very thankful to say that if gen two and three do happen the HP damage is reduced significantly because I learned so much I learned so much and when you do the first time you do it it's so hard but anytime after it just gets easier but I am I have no interest I feel like absolutely no shade or anything to any other VTuber agency if you start throwing gen after gen it is very clear you do not give an absolute rats arse about the content for your girls and it's just it's such a shame that those girls put faith in you as an agency and your response is throw another gen out throw another no absolutely no no very disappointing I don't like that that's just me uh you like instantly became my or she I don't have an endurance for long streamers but I really enjoy stopping in on stream throughout the day I'm glad I'm glad I can catch you I'll see you tomorrow in old school runscape huh huh you might you might not be in the game but I'll be online I'll be online okay 55 HP honestly you keep talking with her damage yeah I keep taking damage with her with her damage human wave tactic based running strongy are there any ASMR stories based on real life um I have rambling ASMR coming out where I'm just kind of talking about stuff that's happening now that's me if you mean the small pp audio then uh there's an anon that's very passionate about it and he sent me a prompt and well he didn't he didn't actually even mean to make it into a script or anything he just sent me a prompt of what he liked and I was like you know what you know what I'll make it into something as so your guys are more than welcome to use marshmallows to put down your things because it unironically can inspire me to make like an entire script um I am happy to take inspiration I'll yonk it I like reading your deep dark fantasy I want to hit them with a diss track I know but also I don't want to go into them and be like public anime number one in veilerland I talk a lot of hmm but I'm such a little teddy bear nah it's all funny I have to admit something I fall asleep to your voice during streams only for a little bit like 30 minutes to an hour the volume doesn't matter your voice just knocks me out I get so cozy from the yapping that I wake you up through the rage part against against the RDA guy in section I'm sorry if I woke you up with my screen hey stroney I'm glad to catch some of your lives I've been recovering from the unmentionable one and I'm finally feeling better I hope to see many more streams from you and the girls someone's signed this with their name sorry I think this might be um uh I'm hope you're okay and I'm glad you feel better you're starting to feel more like yourself sorry you've signed it and I don't know if I should see your name out so for respect I'm not gonna I'm not gonna think it but you guys are welcome to sign maros but I won't see your name if you sign a maro at the bomb okay I'm glad you picked Samwise the brave I am so glad you my refling gave me the courage seriously why the refling I don't know maybe it's because he gives me courage hi stroney saying this is the Scott so when I say this you know it's not just because of the accent I love your voice listen to you up on stream is my favorite part of your stream and when you talk gently it gives me tingles I'm really looking forward to the ASMR wait I can give you tingles just when I be a bit more gentler in the morning that's interesting normally I like I only happen in the the thing the thingy goodbye those who are sleeping I gotta go finish up work have good day yeah have a good day thanks for hanging uh like yeah definitely a not safe what are you saying read out your own risk but are you gonna do a hmm audio involving oh let's call it joystick and we'll take the first three letters are you gonna do hip no joystick uh yes it's one of the main things I'm interested in I want to take full control the question is can I put you under though I'm I'm a bit unskilled at the under part it's scary to put you under because I'm not sure how good I am at it and as well I don't know if the accent is actually a debuff on putting you under a spell or the control type section of it so I'm a bit worried we'll see what happens as I said I'm learning and you guys have been fantastic and it will be like you guys are always fantastic and give me like a lot of space it'll take time to get to get there I'm good at pretending I believe in you I love that you're I'm going to try and I

still actually going to be online if not I'm probably going to redirect you into one of her songs I'll make you listen to ac's furry cover thing xt nestle pouses on your ooh you so warm I love emmy's emmy aces frankly the right the reason why I get ac and emmy mixed up all the time is it because they both begin with I is because I used to call them the twins in development they were called the twins in development I know they're not twins they I just called them twins it just happened okay so emmy and ac always get referred to each other by accident now there's few problems with my if you had a chance to change your oh I changed forget changing fate I put it into my own hands and I am strong it calls the cullfish of the war sending them out to say that you and emmy's are my favorites it means incredibly talented and entertaining and she's an absolute sucky mom but there's something about you that makes you so easy to listen to it's probably because you can tell how low IQ I am so I make you feel safe see mersey's a dork so you lure your guard around her but me because I'm brain dead yeah you can't help it you can't help it thank you for the kind words kind kind of mark warning for stream let's see how far I can read into this before we can as you stare into your reeflings eyes to hypnotize them you get a little too close to one and catch your reflection in the eye you suddenly feel tired and a desire to bend to their oh good girl cuddles you want to give everything to your little reeflings stop oh my god you're no I can't read that I need to finish reading that though no I can't read that no I can't read that it's gonna change my brain thinking right now I can't read that oh my god excuse me mom I am sure you're my oh yes thank you take it that's it ever said that Mario has made the seal of bruv I'm not being funny I felt it flour my favorite pokemon oh you can't make me pick oh there's so many I like creepy pokemon I like when they look cute and creepy who wrote that no no no subspace stop it we're not going into subspace another another time but not not no subspace no subspace all right I bite it because if no the problem is if I go into subspace I can't talk I literally can't talk how am I supposed to entertain if I can't talk if I'm just here squealing like a little picky subspace emissary reference subspace emissary reference no subspace is a thinking type and it makes it really hard for me to freaking talk through it it's really freaking hard no I can't talk and I need to be able to talk you can't just stare at my face while I go I'm so happy that I saw you on my Twitter feed oh is that how you found me on Twitter oh maybe I should actually start using Twitter then oh but I don't like using Twitter all the girls have been so fantastic like I'm streaming in one hour I'm doing this I'm doing that I literally have put nothing on Twitter I can't like I've used Twitter to make ASMR collabs that's it I can't do it okay please please look at the Twitter please it's so can't could stare at your face for an age less you underestimate what you do a karaoke stream with the girls I think latency is too much for me with the girls however the girls might be able to do it with one another because latency wouldn't be an issue um I have to put your stream schedule on my desk to make sure I remember I'm so bad I apologize if people use Twitter for notifications I adjust I don't like it I don't like it I actually don't like it I'm sorry well I'm off to work good night and don't forget to wash you to brush my teeth yes I won't forget uh if it's been 30 minutes since I last drank yes it will be okay we'll brush your teeth right before you end Twitter recently uh officially allowed the content and it's signal boosting the words mentioning oh is it I'm gonna make a certain video then I've been needing to make a video as a thank you for ages and I'm stalling I'm scared because maybe I should do it no no maybe yeah shimmy shimmy yeah shimmy yeah shimmy y'all I wonder what I could be doing and I really strongly made me have a good sleep schedule because I wake up early to watch I'm glad ah yes the bits get upside down when they go to Australia so it takes places long for computer uh it's a bit squid me right now by the pope wow you really are still online good morning good morning thank you for Jenga yes um we finished the game around the nine hour mark and then ended up rambling so much we got to the 10 hour mark and then I made a cup of tea and it just made sense that we're just gonna ramble until the 12 hour mark just because we can yeah yeah no no we're just having a good time we just done our thing but good morning I hope you're all ready for it happening again tomorrow because I'll be online all day I think I got everything but yeah I couldn't I couldn't pick a pokemon I like creepy wee pokemon also no creepy all right I've refreshed again and there's quite a few more questions so hopefully I can get to this stream warning this is meant to miss am I supposed to read it then or not yeah well it didn't work get ready it didn't work hmm he said kneel and submit who bad you're not getting me today I've done see when I do a little bit of the a little bit of the gnosis when I do the gnosis I get very you know so good luck another another day maybe good girls are entertaining with even stop right right whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa scrolling past that stop it even the rest of the viewer are the first I ran into to lean into the other side of content I wasn't sure how to take it at first because it's not my cup of tea but you love being genuinely entertaining regardless wishing on but but thank you so much yes there is a lot of information on the website and like a lot of people didn't realize what the heck what we're doing and it was like bro we're still beach over so we'll be playing games like of course I'm still going to talk about satan creep brotherhood tune and stream snake and all that you know it just means we offer the goods on the other side and we're not a blue ball in you like because there's quite a lot of each of us that like to do the blue ball part and I was like well if you if you want the goods then yeah we'll go there for free you can go on all twitter so if you really if you want to support uh then with your with your money then you can just do it be a patreon or membership if youtube updates it stats tomorrow you almost went into stop I'm not I'm not but yeah well you occasionally dip into the thingy like in pdb that was to paint you all up though I think everyone did a good job we all we all collectively were like you know the meme that's like wait hold on maybe I can find it oh yeah this was literally it basically this meme if I can see the image this was the meme so it was like chaos behind the scenes setting up for debut but like we all came together to discuss how we're like absolutely going to destroy everyone unanimously and like do all these like things to like get everyone pent up I'm not even pretending otherwise like literally chaos is the top one all of us preparing for debut but when it came to discussing like okay let's release the alt twitters it was that was by the pope I admire your work strongy you are fantastic oh thank you so much thank you so much senior mill kerton why senior in your title do I give you an accent thank you for the tip though senior I appreciate it and yeah I'm glad you enjoyed my work doesn't really feel like work I just feel like I'm you know a rainbow in a way I'm stressing out over nothing my butt said I'm marshmallow now I'm doom spare what do you need a is it I think it's called a setter if you if you don't um if you partake I think it's called a setter like oh setter with you you're evil hey and now you gave us the most wholesome girl and exist I've got a lot of those comments where people are like the whole agency was based around like this alternative thing and then like everyone's just like me men along and having a good time and all that and it's like yeah surprise like we're we're here for enjoy ourselves I think it can get quite tiresome of every breathing second it's you know are you squid me right now identify yourself high strontian reeflings from euro time zone good morning good morning oh did you enjoy your sleep thank you alessandro I did enjoy your sleep we made it we made it your girls are amazing at getting people in credit with first day my girl so first day she a Lamborghini that's not that song at all what's that song my girl so Thursday yellow lumber purple Lamborghini I have absolutely not clue what that song supposed to be thank you for the tip alessandro yeah it could be everything but it makes a nice thing a bit of a bit of a male just curious but are there any creators you would like to collaborate with outside the group sadly I am uh very I don't know what the word is if people reach out to me I am more than happy to but I feel like if I reach out then I'm bothering so like the yumi plus girls will be nothing but receptive to me I absolutely adore them so I'm I'm gonna try and get a collab going with them or something or ASMR or anything like that um but like anyone basically the sentence if you f with me I f with you but because like all strongies from um veal or like I don't want anyone feeling forced and I'm also quite appropriate with certain jokes and I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable during a collab so I only I don't know I'm just shy like I really like fen but I would never ask for a collab because I just I I know for a fact like I would just make her uncomfortable so I'm just gonna be like thumbs up from afar love your stuff you know can't wait for the next song cover stop singing I'm trying to turn on my head oh my god that was like so fun sadly most potential clubs speak English instead of scott oh they'll never understand me well there was actually something really funny um was that a zura in debut called me a fish and when we were doing the mock I was with the girls like um we were doing the mock so five of us were in the voice call and whoever was doing the mock went and did it um and as they were called me a fish and I was like a fish in my accent and the girls were like laughing up a storm over it and I was like oh yeah I freaking love it here like they're just so amazing and they they just get it but like I feel like if I collabed with someone outside of veal or like they're afraid to make fun of my accent I'm like no make fun of it are you joking me I say words funny someone was saying like the way I say jewel wheel they're earlier in that like come on man why is my freaking mouth wiggling and now I see you doing that I see you doing that iPhone don't make my mouth wiggle I don't know if it's it's not that dark in this room jewel wheel I jewel wheel now v v for Mari may have the same vibes maybe oh I'm gonna recalibrate the stinky

that's a day what it says the message says III fits a day what but is that my accent and how I pronounce something I'm so sad that the girls these mushrooms get getting yanked because I'm refined to

you've floating on that people the idea to you I like the idea of taking control and like demanding the pay a little joystick I definitely enjoyed it hey strawney is the uh reefling again hope you don't read the word out loud on stream the same time so I guess it's only natural to ask as people are asking about the patreon audio is any stuff coming out for us yeah gon be stuff on me gon be stuff on you it's all over for you it's all over for the both of us actually you were not joking when you said Euro time zone gang would be eating good thanks mom it you're welcome we're playing old

the food do lobsters I don't know if sharks work one prompt for a possible audio free use it's not the same as the other one but I get ignored oh I can do that um I'll need to research a little bit because I'm not sure what to say during that I'll never say young oh maybe can I say that I'm not sure I might say that maybe you help me with training no it doesn't work though it doesn't work hmm I'll have to thank you you'll have to make me use my my brain I can't believe that you made me use my brain how dare you how dare you well there always do one new page on them there's four audios per month if that's what you mean I really get to watch streams since it starts at 2am for me I'm so sorry where are you from you must be you must be paired I've found your location I'm now coming to your house I love when people put their time zone in the chat and then I get to figure out like roughly where they're from I'm just like I'm coming over now it's over for you the girl was streaming when I got home from working to still streaming when I went to sleep and I'm about to go back to work I fear you're scared of me I work at third shifts the streams are hard to come by oh for who are you three chefs that's rough okay and I found four we will be in good zeal good yeah yeah zeal good uh sir I don't know how to say sir in German museo no that's french starting zero meter from your car at zero meters and getting in I'm losing the ep fate on your unit falsely can you last another 20 minutes or is it over it's 20 minutes putting the kettle on for you now oh thanks thanks I don't need a wee cup of tea when I come in is that a threat or an offer off for real though thanks for streaming them because your streams are so long yeah uh streams are completely impossible for vod watchers it's uh pretty crazy unless you kind of use my streams as like something to listen in the background as you work it's like impossible for vod watchers to uh get up to date I always miss streams because of work oh work is so stinky you're telling me capitalism is in is the reason why I don't have more ink we will destroy capitalism I want all the ink like vod watchers they lose and unfortunately with a streamer like me vod watchers are very rough what happens in 20 minutes I go offline we reach the 12 hour stream mark where the vod blows up if I go one second after 12 12 hours so I have to go sadly oh I've been drinking cola I can't brush my teeth you're not to brush your teeth for 30 minutes because of the enamel sorry we did technically brush our teeth today so I didn't do a bad job just a rubbish one if it reaches 12 hours weeks but literally the vod just self combusts clips will come in for the wind for these long yeah it's if you ever clip a section I get to see it and send it to an editor good morning good morning Europe hope you all slept well please don't explode there's only one kind of explosion I want from you I should probably go to bed good night good night rest well those who need to sleep did you do the rda run oh boy I did and I screamed in rage I saw red and I don't remember what I said but hopefully I didn't say hopefully I didn't pass around any uh gamer words kidding kidding relax uh warning do not read on stream is that a challenge are you challenging me right now oh well I've made a pact with Emmy if Emmy gets her not safe for work oh no I'm not supposed to say that I'm supposed to say oh sorry if Emmy gets her all banned you get your wish I made a pact and Emmy agreed instantly so yeah you may get your wish strongy lasagne or sushi what does that mean I mean I'm a fish so sushi is that possibly mean what does it mean now I'm curious what usually pulls you into subspace this will not be used against you at all it's just if I don't expect it and it's like good girl or like a scenario type thing where I'm like all submissive in that and I don't expect it that's when it can like whack me for the side like that other that other good girl that I read out that almost got me type thing but it definitely depends like on the mood and all that type thing but yeah can you say wash your sister sauce I can buy a Worcestershire sauce is that how you say it I don't know how you say it I'm sure there was a whole thing on shrek about Worcestershire sauce yeah I know the feeling is a guy get me into it what we do don't open a video or on stream wash your sister sauce I thought it was Worcestershire Worcestershire I actually don't know the pronunciation I like how to actually say that do you ever think there'll be a full viewer countdown what makes you think there wouldn't be wait for Azura's donathon we're gonna be cooking with that and see what happens Azura's birthday is august 23rd I believe is august 23rd is her birthday you said wash your sister first I'm teasing you will wash your sister sauce I need to ease up or you're gonna have to be patient you're not gonna hold it until august that's too much even I'm saying that's too much um um do not read out load I can't do that wait what did you just ask I'm me I'm sorry that that no that's not on please don't do that that's not right I'm sorry that's not right how was the acting did you guys like that did you like that action he said he said please pretend you have been sent something really offensive and I'm really bad at acting you put me on the spot I'm rubbish at that don't make me do that again did I nail it oh did I have you spills oh maybe maybe I'm better than I think did I get oh we got you got pranked you got pranked me refling pranked you I was getting anxious oh no don't get excited sorry it was just a meme I'm sorry it was just a meme they just wanted me to say something they put please pretend to have been sent something so offensive maybe RDA is better than navi screw the environment faucet is on while person teeth sorry I didn't mean to cause any anxiety I won't do that kind of pranky again hey strony I've been commissioning something of alt fan art would there be any issue with strony and merit no are you kidding me I accept everything bring it show me what you want show me what you want to see okay I'm all caught up I'm all caught up I think maybe some people might be getting their stuff chopped up um rubbish I don't think there's ever gonna be wait does someone ask for a male member I have terrible news for you if you think it's not that well someone said I don't think there's gonna be a male member of veal or yeah sadly not the whole reason veal or is even possible is because of female experience if guys want to start their own male feature agency be my guest but I ain't gonna not do with me mate ain't gonna not from around these parts ain't ain't gonna not do with me yeah I ain't gonna not do with me I have absolutely no advice I could give to male creators because alas I am not a male content creator now Bob do something yeah brother absolutely hi strony there's one vtuber outside of a lure think there is a last that you'll play and ring with both have an accent I really love oh I think you're talking about sin sister yee-ho I'm gonna be collaborating with her we're actually gonna be doing what uh a shock collar I bought myself a shock collar and she got herself a shock collar and I'm going to be shocking her and she's gonna be shocking me I'm so sorry I was just I don't I think I'm starting to lose it mildly honestly considering how delirious I normally get at the end of the stream that really wasn't that bad considering it was just an accent but if you didn't pick up on any of that sin sister and myself have bought shock collars and we were going to play Elden ring together and whoever causes us to lose the battle and perish we get to shock each other yeah I'm gonna have a heart rate monitor I think she also has a heart rate monitor as well so things are gonna get out of hand quick also we're really obnoxious streamers together we don't mute to talk to chat or thank chat so if you do want to join in that stream just know it's a bit of a sensory overload uh because we honestly don't mind each other um doing their thing I mean it's gonna be interesting Strani I know two tubers who possibly mentioned collabing oh my god imagine naming them in marshmallow so I can reach out to them only if they're shown indication though I don't want to offend anyone okay I think that's enough cola for one day it's actually gonna be my bedtime when I get off of stream audio idea you've been having a rough frustrating weekend suddenly find us hide up at your door a gift from madame sheebie to relieve your oh I like that idea like I kind of incorporate in the girl Strani how does it make you feel if I said I wanted to keep you at home and pregnant all times no I want my pink nippies I don't want brown nippies made her pink and puffy I want them to stay pink and puffy pink and puffy bedtime isn't like after this yeah well because of my stream time it's bedtime I've been awake since 2 a.m. start streaming at 4 a.m. it's almost 4 p.m. now so I've been awake for 14 hours so my body starts to shut down now this is when you're getting cognitive
