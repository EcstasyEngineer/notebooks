1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Mummy, the mummy hasn't abandoned no thing.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mummy is in a foolish, foolish streamer.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When I did the footstream, I put my ring light.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I had to move my ring light so I could elimp the shit and put it down to the wall.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
As it eliminate that mummy started streaming on her hands and knees, it's not what she did.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I need the ring light.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The thing that is flashing is the goofy and it's jumping about everywhere.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It went on and on.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So that is going to be the light.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Please, it's the only light.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Alright, my face is eliminated.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm also on reactive mode so I'm actually going to react to the game.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Everyone knows I have an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 with 10,067 megabits.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello, good morning.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let me put it on.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Live chat.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Any live chatter?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I apologize if I sound tired.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I passed out after that RuneScape stream and I woke up 45 minutes ago.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I hope Icy's monetization stream went fantastic.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I believe Emmys is also today.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So if there's any pin pals or snowberries, they're down the hall.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Into the lift.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I apologize if I sound tired.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I am exhausted.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't know how.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I slept for so long.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't know what is going on with me.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But I've got cup of tea.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I've got two waters.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I've got a wee muffin.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And then we can jump into Crash Bandicoot.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:18,000
As for any updates, since I slept, I have absolutely nothing.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A refling sent me a three page story, which I really liked.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But for legal reasons, I cannot speak any of it here.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've also put together a little folder of BibBits.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Which I don't know why I didn't think to do it earlier.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But now I'm putting it all together.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh and a refling sent me a five minute audio.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And he was like, talk!

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was like, oh my god, reflings are getting so brave, honestly.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And before I die a lot, probably, probably, I'm not even going to put it behind me.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't know what level the desktop, how loud the game is going to be compared to me.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But give me a three page story.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It was about me, obviously.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But yes, you guys have been doing fantastic.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I believe AC has done well.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't really have any updates about anything else at the moment.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Other than my freaking ASMR meme video, I've got 30k views.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I'm like, right, this has definitely left the target audience.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because I had 5,000 subscribers when I posted that.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And now we're at 6,000.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm like, bruv, that like propelled my channel.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So I'm waiting, Mercy's is going to go up after this stream.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Or, or it's going to go up after she finishes her stream today.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And then AC's is ready to go up.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I may actually, I'm going to message her right now so she can reply to me.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And see, when you finished stream, do you want me to upload your meme ASMR on your behalf question mark?

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And before you're like, wait, why are you asking the girls permission to do stuff that you made for them?

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because it's their channels.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't want them to be unhappy.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want them to be happy little ducklings with me.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who up?

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Bandy their cooter.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Whoa.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm getting a bit too close to that one.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Any Bandy cooters?

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's only such a sweetheart.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, I don't want to do anything that upsets the girls.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And if they're like, no, now's not the time to upload the meme ASMR.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's fine.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So I'll get permission from them and then possibly after the stream.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Apparently it takes eight hours to do this game.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now, I'ma just say, I was a atom when I played this game.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I have barely any recollection.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
My dad didn't buy it for me.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He bought it for himself.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Johnny, congrats on 6.5k.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, I owe so many ASMR videos.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I was going to try and get my first thank you video out.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, maybe after buckshot roulette after the doc.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because I've got buckshot roulette.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Then I've got a couple hours.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then I go to the doctor.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is this a rhythm game?

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It is not.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's Crash Bandicoot.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It is an adventure platformer.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I know you can't hear the background of the game right now.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So it's just my voice in this room.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do forgive.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Strongly winning a game.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Any ganky desks?

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hold on, let me hydrate with my tea.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I owe so much ASMR.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I do have it all recorded.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I just need to sit and edit it.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And I can't upload the clapping without using my hands ASMR.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yet, I need to have some things in between it.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Strongly winning much and everything right.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a never ending move.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Every time she releases an ASMR, she gains 1k and she gets to go back to square one.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Honestly, I'm like, I hope not.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think it will definitely calm down a bit.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's going to have to calm down.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Because as much as our capitalist overlords love infinite growth,

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
that's just not plausible here.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Nor is it something that is healthy or thingy.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because if you start measuring yourself by numbers and that kind of thing,

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that's when, I think that's when VJubers probably get it in their head.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They're like, oh, I'm not doing well enough.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm not performing well enough.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And it's like, Brev, you haven't even given yourself a chance.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Just have fun.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
People can tell you're sweating on trends if you're trying to sweat on trends, you know?

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And then people can tell when you're just meaming around,

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
when you're just meaming around, you know?

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And guess what?

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know, some streamers, sorry, this has just turned into a philosophical,

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
let's digest and get to the roots of why streamers are streamers.

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Some people are just, what's the word,

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
optimized to have a nice, cosy, tight-knit community.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay?

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Some people, some of your personalities, other streamers,

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
you're just supposed to have a nice little tight-knit community.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're not supposed to be for the masses, you know?

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So don't always be reaching for the fricking stratosphere, the stars.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't always be reaching for the stars when you do just fine in the stratosphere, you know?

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Every time you gain 1k, you release an ASMR that gains you 1k.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So it's an infinite feedback loop you'll be at.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Infinity subs by the end of the week.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Not quite.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Especially those looking to extract numbers from TikTok that only have 100 subs,

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
but say they deserve a million views on every post.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can actually get into the psychology on why people feel they deserve subscribers,

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
versus others who feel unworthy of what they get because of what they've done.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I could definitely go on an algorithm stream that in, not tinfoil time,

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
no it's not tinfoil, it's not tinfoil, it's not tinfoil.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's like human psychology as well as the damage that the internet does to the mind.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Cos if you didn't know, you're actually not supposed to be exposed to,

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think you're not supposed to actually know more than 100 faces at once,

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and your brain is just not wired for any other way.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
After that, your brain can only be wired to recognise tribes, which sounds terrible,

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
but that's just how it is, so it's like, ah, I am approaching the AC clan, you know?

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Or the tribe.

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Are you studying psychology?

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Absolutely not, I have had enough of education.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I say that, I might be going back to beauty school,

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
but that's for, I'm talking like five years down the line beauty school type thing,

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
because I might want to run an ASMR room studio type thing,

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
but that's just me, that's just me.

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Need a tinfoil hat or more?

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
For the reflins?

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Honestly, I'm so down for that.

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I need the meds to moat back, I need the thigh gripper moat back,

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
all other emotes that I need back.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was actually going to ask if a refling has any batch to emotes,

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
so wink wink, if you could send me a cat box file of the batch itself,

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
so I know what to reorder, because I picked what I wanted.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Just so you know, just so we're all on the same, I picked what I wanted.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh yeah, Crash Bandicoot 3.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, so I was but an atom and my dad bought this game for himself,

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and the only thing I remember doing on this game is playing Coco on China

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and using the horse all the time.

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The horse, the tiger all the time.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll have to catch stream later as I'm working on eight slides of insurance termed out.

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Even the thought of that is terrible.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't know what's going on with my teas, I've not been enjoying them as of late.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm getting a bit nervous, I'm getting a bit shaky why I'm not enjoying my teas,

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
because normally I'm all over them.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Although I have been enjoying this fruit juice company thing,

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and they put loads of fruit in the juice, and then they juice it,

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and then I drink the juice, and then I get all the goodness in me.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah.

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I've had too many teas, this is a very plausible and realistic sense.

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Although I've only had one tea the day, I'll literally only, I woke up like,

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
well I woke up an hour ago now,

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
woke up, spammed the PC on, started spamming pre-chat for a few moments,

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
checked out AC to see what's going on with her, she's fine,

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
checked out the Discord to see if the girls are fine, they're fine,

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
refueling, slacking flavour lately.

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're not enjoying the tea because it's all just special, aren't you?

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh my god, it sounds terrible, but should I just get a cola?

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't think drinking a cola first thing in the morning is a good idea though.

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's a terrible idea.

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay, let's get into Crash Bandicoot.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Any Crash Bandicooters?

193
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Is that too loud? Or is that fine?

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh my god.

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
How do I leave? Oh, my controller isn't even awake, hold on.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah, plug my controller in.

197
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So there's three games in it, I've only ever played Warped,

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't know what the other two are about.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Hey, I guess the game.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Override save.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is it too loud?

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Guys, groovy as anything, maybe turn it down a little.

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay, I'll do it in the start menu after the cutscene.

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, we're crashing?

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh, I guess we are called Crash Bandicoot.

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Thank you.

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh my god, that's so beautiful.

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh, it kinda looks like a Snow Berry.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Snow Berry.

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh my god, this is so beautiful, this game.

211
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It was that Infernal Bandicoot.

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Bandicoot.

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, wait, it's a Tiki Mask, like Earth Tiki Mask guy.

214
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What?

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Insane.

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, I don't remember any of this.

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Whoa, fuck it.

220
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, that was a flashbang first thing in the morning.

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Did you see that?

222
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I can't see anymore.

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh my god, this game is so beautiful and cool.

224
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
For real, I think I just got a virus.

225
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, I remember something like that.

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh my gosh, that was so beautiful.

227
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Wait, hold on.

228
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I need to turn down the volume a little bit.

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
My apologies.

230
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Game options, music, 8.

231
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Wait.

232
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, I could do this all day.

233
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We'll do 8s.

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh my god.

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, wait, you can't control the camera angle.

236
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What does Y do?

237
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Y shows me my light, what does B do?

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No.

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh my god, POV, I'm coming for AC.

240
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm a snowberry going for AC.

241
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh my god, on the prowl, on the prowl.

242
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm an Oji-san.

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Come to me, AC, my princess.

244
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Daddy wants...

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh my god, this is so precious.

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is so cool.

247
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh my god, wait, I remember these symbols a little bit.

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No.

249
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I mean, it's more powerful because I'm the goodie.

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're the baddie.

251
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh my god, right.

252
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Where does this work?

253
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh my god.

254
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh my god, this is like, you can...

255
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh my god, we flints, we're already on the farm.

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
10 out of 10 game, we're already on the farm.

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Wait, how do I do that?

258
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
To jump to spin to crutch for inventory.

259
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why would I need to see my inventory?

260
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I guess if you're going for like 100%, but...

261
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh my god, we can bomb.

262
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This game is beautiful.

263
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't remember that.

264
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Does that need to hurt it?

265
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh no, we spanked it.

266
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Right, we spanked it.

267
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We didn't kill it.

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
We spanked it away.

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay, it's fine.

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh god.

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh my god.

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh no, thank you for the 5.

273
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay, I can definitely take fall damage.

274
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh my...

275
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Checkpoint.

276
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm remembering.

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Wait, go back on the farm.

278
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Go back on the farm.

279
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What does this do?

280
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Okay, if you hit it at a certain time.

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh my god, we're on the farm.

282
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Right, frogs.

283
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Frogs can hurt us.

284
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Go back on the farm, where you belong.

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh my god, I can spank everyone.

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, I love this game.

287
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Wait, how about if I get two of the good bookers?

288
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, he's glowing.

289
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, you are glowing.

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What the heck is it?

291
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What did I do?

292
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Where am I going?

293
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh no.

294
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What's this?

295
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, it's bone.

296
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I got an achievement for doing this.

297
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a bonus level.

298
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Wow.

299
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Is this just like free apples?

300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh my apples.

301
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I never picked them up.

302
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh my god, that's so cool.

303
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Fa la la la la la la.

304
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Who's farm the dream?

305
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The bleeding hearts are getting spanked.

306
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
For real, for real.

307
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
A wimper fruit.

308
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
A wimper fruit.

309
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
One puff, one puff fruit.

310
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Go back to the farm.

311
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, we trick shot it with the bleeding heart.

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We trick shot it.

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Go back to the farm.

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
No frog for gen two.

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh my god, Shibi really wants a slim girl for gen two.

316
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't know how to break it to her.

317
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
She really wants a gen two.

318
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm just like, maybe I'll give Shibi a Halloween outfit.

319
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Wait, have we already been here before?

320
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Or is this just kind of the same layout?

321
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Okay, and spank.

322
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What?

323
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's pink.

324
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Why is there a gap in this bridge?

325
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.

326
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No slim girl?

327
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No, maybe I'll give Shibi a slim Halloween outfit.

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
How about that?

329
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Slim girls.

330
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I get it.

331
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What?

332
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, wait, so if you miss it, you'll...

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

334
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I missed a box.

335
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Stinky, I don't know where it was.

336
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Slim girls are my favorite monster girl.

337
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, but slimes are hot.

338
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm not sure.

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't know.

340
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, they came out of my ear hole.

341
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oops.

342
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And then we just go back in Indra too.

343
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Oh my god, that's cool.

344
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
This game is easy.

345
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I like how fun and easy it is here.

346
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Lamia's are my favorite.

347
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I would entertain a Lamia.

348
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, the fisher thing.

349
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
To kick fast.

350
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Whoa!

351
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Whoa!

352
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay, wait, that was very dumb.

353
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Sorry, that was incredibly dumb.

354
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Whoa, this game's so pretty.

355
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sorry, I've not got much accuracy under the war,

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
even though I'm a cuttlefish.

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I know.

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't want to...

359
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Did I just like go past them?

360
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Wait, that's a checkpoint.

361
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh my gosh!

362
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I remember something like this.

363
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I used to be so scared of it as a child.

364
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I thought I only remembered Coco.

365
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I can hear a box back there.

366
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Wait, what does that shark do?

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Please email him.

368
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Oh, there's a sand dollar.

369
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
On the ground.

370
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Whoa, there's...

371
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Jeez, this game is so cute.

372
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I can't believe I didn't play this before.

373
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Well, I mean...

374
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Sorry, I got scared.

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't know if I can hurt those pufferfish.

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Checkpoint.

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Checkpoint.

378
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Why checkpoint?

379
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What's here that shouldn't be here?

380
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Is there something below that's going to kill me?

381
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Because why did I get a checkpoint?

382
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You can switch to play Coco.

383
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh!

384
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh my gosh.

385
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What?

386
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
No wonder this game did so good.

387
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's like so creative.

388
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Bomb, bomb, bomb.

389
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh, there's hidden boxes under the coral rays.

390
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's okay.

391
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We're not going for 100%

392
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
because I don't know how to 100% this game.

393
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But we can go for lots of fruit.

394
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Probably yummy yummy fruit.

395
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Oh, I can beat shark up in this.

396
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I can explode things in this.

397
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Let's go.

398
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh no, I broke it.

399
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm a bit of a klutz.

401
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I accidentally broke it.

402
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Bomb, bomb, bomb.

403
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh wait, that's not the song anymore.

404
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's whatever the underwater.

405
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh!

406
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Sure, we'll get these boxes.

407
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I think it's safe enough.

408
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh my god.

409
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What do you mean I'm so in love with a game

410
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
that's got the difficulty for literal children?

411
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I can't believe it.

412
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The accusations are unfounded.

413
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I play Skyrim on Legendary mode

414
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
just because you can.

415
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It doesn't mean you need to be...

416
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Wait, can I hurt this?

417
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh no, I can beat up the little puffer fish.

418
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, the purple puffers.

419
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay, there we go.

420
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Whoa, there's the prank crystal.

421
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Okay, let's get it.

422
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Wait, is that going to explode?

423
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh wow!

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, if you don't do it in time,

425
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
it becomes a solid.

426
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay, that's curious.

427
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Is it hard to get 100%?

428
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, I missed a lot of boxes this time.

429
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Didn't do that good this time.

430
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But it's okay.

431
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm happy just loving everything.

432
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The scene reminds me so much of Jack and Dax, though.

433
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Jack and Dax.

434
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, I threw that one up this time,

435
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
so it doesn't always come out your ear.

436
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Wee!

437
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The Orient Express.

438
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Coco!

439
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh, this is the mission!

440
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh my god, this is the mission.

441
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Ah!

442
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Coco!

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And we're for the Tigers.

444
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They missed!

445
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh my god!

446
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh my god!

447
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh my god!

448
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh my god!

449
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I know it's like first thing in the morning,

450
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
but I'm so happy!

451
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh my god!

452
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
This is the mission that I always remember

453
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
from childhood.

454
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Oh my god!

455
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Go, Coco!

456
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Go, Coco!

457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You're doing it!

458
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Oh, you're so beautiful!

459
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh my god!

460
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's the music!

461
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

462
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Get it, get it!

463
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh my god!

464
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Get it, get it, get it!

465
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yes!

466
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh no, I hurt myself.

467
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh, I didn't know what I was supposed to do there.

468
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I forgot.

469
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I forgot, but I got a checkpoint, so it's okay.

470
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh, I jumped into it!

471
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Coco, no!

472
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
No!

473
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Oh, but it's okay.

474
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The Tiger forgives me for being a terrible driver.

475
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, I did it again!

476
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh shit!

477
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Stop jumping!

478
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What happens?

479
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, okay.

480
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
No more jumping.

481
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
No jumpies.

482
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Jumpies, no.

483
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But no jumpies.

484
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And then big boy jumpies.

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh, I missed.

486
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What the heck?

487
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I was so close.

488
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Oh, if I run ahead, I can attack.

489
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Run!

490
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Tiger!

491
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, how can you?

492
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh no!

493
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It's so bad!

494
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh my god!

495
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Wait, what happens if I run out of lives?

496
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Is it over?

497
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Is it over for me?

498
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
This is over for me?

499
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Wait, can I just run ahead and hurt them?

500
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Whee!

501
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Whoa, that was a freaking leap and a half!

502
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Call me Joe Leeper,

503
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
because one Tiger run is all it takes.

504
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Whee!

505
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Oh my god!

506
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's such a good mission!

507
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, my little Tizer!

508
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Soft, giddy, warm, giddy, little ball of fluff.

509
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh, that's the best mission in the entire game.

510
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay, we can end stream now.

511
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That's all we needed to do.

512
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's all we needed to do.

513
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I don't know what the diamond is.

514
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Right, what we got next.

515
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The Boneyard!

516
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There are like three more of that?

517
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh my god!

518
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
What?

519
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh no!

520
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Neurons activated from childhood.

521
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh no!

522
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I think I get chased this entire mission!

523
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Oh no!

524
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh no, there's lava everywhere!

525
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's jumping faster!

526
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, I don't know, I'm jumping faster!

527
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Oh my god!

528
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Wait, why did you do that?

529
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Crash, crash!

530
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Crash, why did you do that?

531
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Crash, jump, crash!

532
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Crash, you need to jump like double jump!

533
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Whoa, wait, I can't do it!

534
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Wait, can I just stay here forever in the tower?

535
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Is that a Tyrannosaurus talk or something like that?

536
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Wait, why can I not jump that?

537
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Can you double jump it again?

538
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Oh, is it that?

539
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Jump, spin?

540
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Whoa, I could hardly get over that!

541
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh no!

542
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I can't believe it, childhood me strikes again!

543
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Can I not double jump?

544
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Hold the jump!

545
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Hold the jump?

546
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What the heck?

547
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm not going to make it!

548
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm going to run out of life!

549
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh no!

550
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Wait!

551
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Wait, it's not doing anything!

552
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Hold on, let's practice.

553
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump!

554
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Jump?

555
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I don't know how to double jump.

556
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's not letting me double jump.

557
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Oh, it is letting me double jump.

558
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Wait, but I jumped right into it!

559
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Oh my god, it's so over and the stream hasn't even freaking started!

560
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I can't figure it double jump.

561
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Is my input wrong?

562
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm holding A on my controller.

563
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
There is no double jump.

564
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
He is...

565
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm getting so confused.

566
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Is this a child's game or not?

567
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Answer me!

568
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Is this game for kids to complete or not?

569
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's not looking good.

570
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Can't even get through the first freaking jump!

571
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Dash jump is one way.

572
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's for kids.

573
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm getting filtered by level 3 actually.

574
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I don't know how to do it.

575
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm like trying to extend the jump.

576
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But there's nothing to extend it.

577
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's just a street magma jump!

578
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You unlock double jump after beating a boss.

579
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Wait, so leave and then go to beat a boss and come back?

580
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Are you holding your jump button down instead of tapping?

581
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
If I tap, hold, tap.

582
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Holding, tapping.

583
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Right, hold A.

584
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Holding A.

585
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Fuck!

586
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Holding A.

587
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
This is me holding A!

588
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Okay, it just seems to be like so tiny and slate.

589
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Like minuscule.

590
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Right, this is the furthest I've ever got.

591
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Don't mess up now.

592
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Don't mess up now.

593
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay, I need a breather honestly.

594
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Alright, I'm just going to keep going.

595
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh my god!

596
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Why was that so hot?

597
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh, that's TNT!

598
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That's more TNT!

599
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
They explode!

600
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay, we did it.

601
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Oh gee, willikers, I sure hope we don't have to do that segment again,

602
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
because what the heck, why was that so hard?

603
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I literally have no double jump open.

604
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You should try jumping over them.

605
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Timing matters.

606
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
What's this?

607
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh, a platform?

608
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't have access to it.

609
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Go away, you scared me.

610
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Oh my god, it's discord nature!

611
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Did this...

612
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
What does that do?

613
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Okay, well, I remember what it does now.

614
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Wait, can I do this?

615
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Go away, you're so creepy!

616
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Where are you?

617
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Oh, bonus time, bonus time!

618
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's what it does.

619
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Don't touch the nature.

620
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
No discord daddies.

621
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
No discord groomers in the velar.

622
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Good luck.

623
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Bounce?

624
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Bounce?

625
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh my god, free life!

626
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Well, I definitely needed that after how...

627
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Why is he so slow when he crouches?

628
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay, I like the bonus distance.

629
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Where's the key?

630
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I tried to tap crouch when walking to get faster.

631
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Tap crouch while walking.

632
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, every hundred apples, I get a life.

633
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Ah, those things are so scary.

634
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Exclamation mark.

635
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What the heck did I just do?

636
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh no, I was supposed to jump.

637
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I missed the jump.

638
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I was supposed to jump on top of the moku.

639
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't like this camera angle.

640
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
No, this is why I didn't like the camera angle.

641
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It felt like I was going to get chased again.

642
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Okay, give me the checkpoint at least.

643
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Oh, there's...

644
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Gate the way up.

645
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
No, no, no!

646
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Wait, what was that?

647
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Crash? Crash?

648
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Did you just stand on lava and let me win?

649
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh my God, the game feels so bad for me.

650
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That is letting me win.

651
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It feels so bad for me.

652
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Please don't slow me down.

653
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh my God, get me out of here.

654
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh, get me out of here.

655
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm not playing this level again.

656
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Wampa roots, they're wampas.

657
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Sorry.

658
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh my God, the game felt so bad it let me walk on lava.

659
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Oh, that came up more.

660
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Honestly, me right now.

661
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Did I do four there?

662
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes, I did.

663
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Right, we're not playing that one again.

664
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That one was stinky.

665
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
We're doing five.

666
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We're doing...

667
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh, Coco!

668
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
What's this one?

669
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Making waves.

670
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Course...

671
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Huh?

672
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
To accelerate, right trigger.

673
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
There's no backwards.

674
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Oh my God, it's so wobbly, wobbly!

675
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Whee!

676
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Jump shot!

677
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Oh my God, this is...

678
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Oh, there's a bomba.

679
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Wait, wait, let me get the bomba.

680
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Trick shot, trick shot, trick shot, trick shot.

681
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh, 360.

682
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I missed fast, okay.

683
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
360!

684
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
She's actually doing spins.

685
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm not doing any input for her to do those spins, by the way.

686
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm just jumping on it.

687
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, there's bombas!

688
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Bomba!

689
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Oh no, I've only got seven lives.

690
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh well, I just regained a new one.

691
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay.

692
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
This is a child's game.

693
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Children can play this, so I can play this.

694
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
For I too, I'm wise enough to play a child's game.

695
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Surely.

696
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Surely I won't have to run out of lives.

697
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
If I play the same game,

698
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
like same level over and over,

699
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
did I just get infinite lives?

700
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Because we might have to farm lives

701
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
unironically.

702
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Right, hold on, what's going on here?

703
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
No, yes, yes.

704
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Okay, we made it, and we're going to get this checkpoint.

705
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Excuse me?

706
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I said we're going to get this checkpoint.

707
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Coco!

708
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Oh my god.

709
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Edging me right now.

710
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Wow!

711
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Oh, that was close, that was close.

712
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I was a bit too close for comfort.

713
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Timon's going to be fine.

715
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, there's a seagull!

716
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

717
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Slow it down, slow it down.

718
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Slow and steady, when's the race?

719
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Do I need to go 100 miles per minute?

720
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Wah!

721
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Honestly?

722
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Good game.

723
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I am going to drop it to the bomb!

724
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But I didn't, because I'm so

725
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
emotional at this child's game.

726
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Wah!

727
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Oh, there's two bombs, that's cheeky.

728
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The devs did that for a reason.

729
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They knew I was going to be greedy

730
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and go for the bomba.

731
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

732
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Hello?

733
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Okay.

734
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Holy crap, I was like, can I even

735
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
go near that at all?

736
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Steady, easy, easy.

737
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Take it easy.

738
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Steady.

739
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'd say someone steady wins the race, but sometimes

740
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
sometimes you're going to just send it

741
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and get out of here.

742
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh my god.

743
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh, this is so good.

744
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Who suggested this game?

745
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Congrats on you if you suggested it.

746
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Just kidding, I picked it, because it's a child's

747
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
game.

748
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay.

749
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The boss fight!

750
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Oh no!

751
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Tiny Tiger.

752
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh no.

753
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Am I going to get perished by a boss?

754
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Crash.

755
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Stole the pretty crystals.

756
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Tiny, take them back.

757
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Excalibur Arena.

758
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Sometimes here.

759
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Oh no.

760
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
All the music is banging though.

761
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh no.

762
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
MonkaS.

763
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
MonkaS, what'd I do?

764
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS.

765
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Ah!

766
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Please leave me alone.

767
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh my god, he's got J's on like me.

768
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Spank!

769
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine.

770
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
One and three, one and three, we follow.

771
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What does that mean?

772
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
What does that mean?

773
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
There's Tigers!

774
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm to avoid

775
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
everything.

776
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Uh,

777
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
what?

778
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm to avoid all those Tigers?

779
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Right, Spank

780
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
and then Tigers. Right, we can do this.

781
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
We can do this.

782
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Okay, take your time.

783
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Uh-huh.

784
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Uh-huh.

785
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Oh yeah, uh-huh.

786
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh yeah, uh-huh.

787
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Okay, okay, I just got a little call

788
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
up in the last one.

789
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Okay, just keep running.

790
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Just keep running, just keep running.

791
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Spank!

792
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And then we do it all over again.

793
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Okay.

794
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Okay.

795
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

796
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
This is so much faster than the second phase.

797
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But that's okay!

798
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay.

799
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Okay, okay, just keep running.

800
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Just keep running around. He'll come to me.

801
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We did it, we're doing it, we're doing it,

802
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
we're doing it, we're doing it.

803
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Spank!

804
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Oh, we did it! Oh, what did we get?

805
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What is this?

806
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Oh, that's a boo!

807
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Tomato, tomato, boo!

808
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Beat him while he's down, beat him while he's down!

809
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Ah!

810
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Take this.

811
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Oh, okay, what is this?

812
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Supercharged Body Slam.

813
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
For a more professional belly flop, press A

814
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and B

815
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
to the top of the jump.

816
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Please!

817
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I love this so much!

818
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh, that's so good, I love it!

819
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Momay Domination.

820
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Dang straight.

821
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Dang straight!

822
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well done, children.

823
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
By defeating Tiny,

824
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you have unlocked the gate to the next time travel area.

825
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Go back to the center

826
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
of this time, Trister,

827
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
and save your progress if you wish.

828
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
From there, you will see

829
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
that the gate to the second time travel area

830
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
is now open.

831
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Okay!

832
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Thank you!

833
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay.

834
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Okay, so I've unlocked everything in this one.

835
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
In the castle segment.

836
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
How do I save the game?

837
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Left trigger, save.

838
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Uh, sure.

839
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh, auto-save is already active.

840
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
That's fine.

841
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah, just save that though.

842
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah, okay.

843
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Just in case.

844
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Um, um, um, um, um.

845
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
What is this?

846
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So we've got Arabia,

847
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
China,

848
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Egypt,

849
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
the future,

850
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
South Korea then,

851
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
for the future.

852
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Tiny Spiny!

853
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I would just like to formally say that I,

854
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Tiny Spiny,

855
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
am not associated with Tiny Tiny in any way,

856
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and do not endorse his actions.

857
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
No.

858
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It's going so good!

859
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I love it!

860
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Wow, Bejinga!

861
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Thank you for the five gifted memberships.

862
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

863
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It means you get access to the emotes.

864
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm going to very quickly grab

865
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
a can of cola.

866
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'll be literally in those seconds,

867
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
because I couldn't finish my tea, so

868
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'll just get cola.

869
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Surely the caffeine will wake me up.

870
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Sure.

871
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:55,000
My question

872
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
is,

873
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
surely not all commissions are that short,

874
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
because there's only five locations,

875
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and if there's only five locations,

876
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't,

877
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I think they were going to be finished with

878
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
gaming two hours and,

879
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and redirect him into Sheevy,

880
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
because there's no way.

881
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Thank you for the gifted membership,

882
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Bejinga, and thank you for

883
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
the tip,

884
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
TinySpainE.

885
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
They're short, but you'll die a lot.

886
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
What happens if I get zero lives?

887
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Like, I genuinely lose?

888
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This is called

889
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
G-Wiz

890
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and

891
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Why? Why must you continue to be

892
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
a thorn in our sight?

893
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Who? What?

894
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Where was I?

895
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Oh, Tiny was a good

896
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
fellow.

897
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
He hated everyone and everything,

898
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
but a good heart,

899
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
nonetheless.

900
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Please be more reasonable with my minions

901
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
next time.

902
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It deletes your save file?

903
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Am I being trolled right now,

904
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
or do I genuinely lose all progress?

905
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Because this is an old game,

906
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and that's exactly what old games did.

907
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
They make you lose your, well,

908
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
go back to the farm!

909
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Go back to the farm!

910
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Back to the farm!

911
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh!

912
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Belly Float!

913
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Okay.

914
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Wow!

915
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Oh!

916
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

917
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We know...

918
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
the way I absolutely decimated that

919
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
poor man.

920
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's not that old. You just lose your score

921
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
and start from your latest level.

922
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Oh!

923
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
A game over. The player is given the option

924
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
to either restart the game from the beginning of the level,

925
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
checkpoint not counted,

926
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
with the standard number of lives, four,

927
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
or to quit to the title screen.

928
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Okay.

929
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So I don't lose all my Puegue.

930
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
That's good, because if I lost all my progress,

931
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
we're actually going to play

932
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
a game called Conquer's Bad Fur Day,

933
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
but Conquer's Bad Fur Day

934
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
is so old that

935
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
you... Oh my god, I like got a trickshot there.

936
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It's so old that you lose your progress

937
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
if you

938
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
mess up.

939
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So I'm going to try and win Conquer's Bad Fur Day,

940
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
but I actually have terrible news.

941
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I don't know if I can win it.

942
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Go back on the farm! Both of you!

943
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You've been getting so distracted playing...

944
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh.

945
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Go away.

946
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Ah, not me!

947
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't like meages, go away.

948
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Chicken!

949
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Go! Checkpoint!

950
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Ah, this game is so good.

951
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It doesn't even... How do you not blow up that nature?

952
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
As if it's not right next to you.

953
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Oh my god, Crash!

954
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Oh my shoes!

955
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
No!

956
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I got too excited.

957
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I need to unlock double jump right now.

958
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm so bad.

959
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Let's go.

960
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Let's go.

961
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Let's go.

962
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Let's go.

963
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm so bad.

964
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Literally, it has like infinite health.

965
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Enemies can't touch me.

966
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
What defeats me? A gap in the ground.

967
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay, I see how it is.

968
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Ah!

969
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Bleeding heart was coming right at me.

970
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
What?

971
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Oh no, not me! Oh, I don't like meages.

972
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Big jump! Great, checkpoint.

973
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Is there going to be like an enemy behind this?

974
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I feel like this is too...

975
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
No, there isn't. Okay, I'm surprised.

976
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Wow!

977
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh, I missed.

978
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Bonus time!

979
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Oh, that frog just...

980
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
did it's self in.

981
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I don't know if you saw that.

982
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
He's that I've had enough.

983
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Only Stronik is doing well.

984
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Actually Crash and Conquer are both

985
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Ginger.

986
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
What do you have for that?

987
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Thank you anonymous for the tip.

988
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I appreciate it.

989
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Yeah, Conquer is Bad Friday.

990
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I have no idea why my dad let me play that game.

991
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I know that I think about it because it's absolutely outrageous.

992
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh wait, I can't really fucking know.

993
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh my god, I like the jumpy ones.

994
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Conquer is Bad Friday was far too inappropriate.

995
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Oh, it's a timer!

996
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's a timer!

997
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's a timer!

998
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It's a timer.

999
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I don't like timer stuff, sorry.

1000
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh wait, no!

1001
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I missed the box back there!

1002
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Let me go down, go down!

1003
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I missed the box!

1004
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Let me go back!

1005
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I missed that!

1006
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Farm, no.

1007
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Oh, there's two of them now.

1008
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Farm!

1009
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
To the farm!

1010
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
You will be a slave on it.

1011
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And you will do all the bidding.

1012
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And then the refling is going to have a day off because you're the bad guy.

1013
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Farm, no.

1014
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Eh?

1015
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
What did that do?

1016
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
No, it was on the bonus level!

1017
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm a stinky stinkerton!

1018
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I asked the game to put me go back,

1019
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
but it never put me back.

1020
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm eating my blueberry muffin

1021
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
because I need to eat.

1022
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
What's in the box?

1023
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Disappointment!

1024
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Because I can't go back.

1025
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I want to go back!

1026
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I want to go back!

1027
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Okay, let me eat my muffin.

1028
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Classic 5am

1029
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Physicers, honestly.

1030
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
This OST is bangin'.

1031
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I didn't realise how good Crash Bandicoot was.

1032
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
For the OST, I didn't remember any of it.

1033
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Have you talked to Coco in the hub?

1034
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I don't really search for that stuff when I'm on the hub.

1035
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm more of an overwatch searcher.

1036
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That was terrible.

1037
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Interact, Ray Bumper.

1038
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Hi!

1039
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Do you want her to join your adventure?

1040
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I can go be Coco?

1041
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, that's going to confuse me.

1042
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Sorry, Coco, you're going to have to go away.

1043
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Ah! Wait, I get to play as a girl?

1044
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Ooh!

1045
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
A girl gamer.

1046
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
She's just like me.

1047
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I want to be Coco because I'm a girl.

1048
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Let me finish my muffin.

1049
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It's like a little baby blueberry muffin.

1050
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Ah!

1051
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I cannot wait to get 3D models

1052
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
because you will see how much I move around

1053
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and articulate with my hands

1054
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and all of that.

1055
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Boy! Thank you for the gifted member.

1056
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And E-boss.

1057
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Thank you for becoming on the membership tier.

1058
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Membership streams start next week.

1059
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So after buckshot roulette

1060
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
or probably at the start of buckshot roulette stream

1061
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I will reveal to you my humble schedule

1062
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
for a stream that week.

1063
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Oh yeah, you successfully avoided

1064
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
the membership again.

1065
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Can't wait for Strony to flip us off in 3.

1066
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I saw someone

1067
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
3D model have physics

1068
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
around their buttocks area

1069
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and I'm like, I need that ASAP.

1070
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Sorry, I've almost finished my muffin.

1071
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Oh my god.

1072
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
These games have such charm.

1073
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Like when your character is AFK

1074
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
they do like a little idle thing.

1075
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Like it's... oh!

1076
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Oh, we've got a phone call. Hold on, who's this?

1077
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I see, what's going on?

1078
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Alright, bye.

1079
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
She hardly even spoke to him.

1080
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Right, are we on 7?

1081
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Hang them high.

1082
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Literally, there's like so much detail.

1083
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Whoa, what's this?

1084
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Oh my god.

1085
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Who knows that Aladdin soundtrack?

1086
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Prince Ali

1087
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Whoa, what am I supposed to do with that?

1088
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Am I supposed to spank him when he looks away?

1089
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
That's what you get.

1090
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Thank you again, boy.

1091
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Boy for the 5 gifted members.

1092
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Big congrats to those who caught it.

1093
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Whoa, what is that?

1094
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
What is that?

1095
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
What the fuck is that?

1096
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
What the fuck? What is he doing?

1097
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Does he just block the wave?

1098
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Okay, oh my god.

1099
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm sorry, but that's so menacing.

1100
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
When something follows your movement pattern

1101
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
that is so menacing.

1102
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I did not enjoy that.

1103
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Don't do that again.

1104
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Don't ever spawn in an enemy like that again game

1105
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
because it's so like scary.

1106
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Hold on, I'm having a cola hydration check.

1107
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
What the fuck?

1108
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
No, no, Coco, stop getting phone calls.

1109
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
God, you're one busy girl.

1110
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Oh, wait, hold on.

1111
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Wait, jump and then hit.

1112
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah.

1113
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And then...

1114
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Whoa, oh my god.

1115
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I feel like games like this

1116
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
used to be so creative, honestly.

1117
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Right, jump down, check point.

1118
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
What was that?

1119
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Dab.

1120
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Oh, that was so mean.

1121
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
He had the delivery to do,

1122
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
and I just ruined his delivery.

1123
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Go away. You scare me.

1124
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Menacing man on a carpet.

1125
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Wow.

1126
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oh my god, there's so much.

1127
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Whoa, oh, there's a monkey again.

1128
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's okay.

1129
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Oh, I hurt myself.

1130
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
But when you hurt yourself,

1131
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
you'll also hurt the enemy.

1132
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Okay, I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning.

1133
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Wow, I can't see.

1134
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Check point, I can't see now.

1135
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I am a monkey.

1136
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Oh, wait, I didn't realize I could do that.

1137
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Go away, go away, man on the carpet.

1138
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Go away.

1139
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
You scare me.

1140
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I don't really want scorpions on the fan,

1141
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
so I don't think we'll send them.

1142
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Oh, there's a bonus level down here.

1143
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Look, I see it, I see it, I see it.

1144
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Take us to the bonus level.

1145
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You missed some boxes.

1146
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I didn't realize I could attack while I was hanging up.

1147
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, I missed completely.

1148
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh no, I got drabated.

1149
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm supposed to go up here.

1150
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Wait, I'd rather go for a life.

1151
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I was speeding up.

1152
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Oh, wait, I can't get them.

1153
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Whoa, that was lucky.

1154
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Wait, what?

1155
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
How am I supposed to get that one down there?

1156
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Oh, butt bouncing adventures!

1157
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Pre-DLC.

1158
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
How am I supposed to get down there?

1159
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Was that supposed to do something?

1160
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't know, chief.

1161
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I didn't get it.

1162
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
TNT, am I supposed to blow it up?

1163
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I don't know.

1164
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Literally, we're doing butt bouncing adventures

1165
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
for Elden Ring even now.

1166
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So, for the Elden Ring DLC.

1167
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Wow.

1168
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Those are so good.

1169
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Oh, we're at 14 lives as well.

1170
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
That's fantastic.

1171
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I can't wait to make 14 mistakes.

1172
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Oh!

1173
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
He bumped me away!

1174
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Checkpoint!

1175
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
What am I supposed to do here?

1176
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That?

1177
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Ow!

1178
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I couldn't get over it.

1179
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
See you lanky tall bastards!

1180
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Honestly.

1181
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
How do I do the bottom one?

1182
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

1183
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
How do I do the bottom ones?

1184
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Okay.

1185
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
That makes sense.

1186
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Oh!

1187
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You know what?

1188
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Give me double jump already.

1189
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Just give me double jump.

1190
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
This is getting outrageous.

1191
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Just give me double jump.

1192
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Right, you look ready.

1193
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Parish to the Fires of Gondor.

1194
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Wait, no, that's not it.

1195
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Cast it into the Fires of Gondor.

1196
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
No, that's not right.

1197
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
See you and your wee weaving baskets!

1198
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
He almost pushed me off the map!

1199
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Don't bump me!

1200
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
What did that do?

1201
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Oh!

1202
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Wait, what did that do?

1203
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Something just happened.

1204
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I don't know what.

1205
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Well, get me out of this level.

1206
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I got too confused.

1207
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm not well enough for that.

1208
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
The Fires of Gondor.

1209
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I don't know why I said that.

1210
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm doing too many things at once.

1211
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
This is really hard on my brain.

1212
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I didn't like that one.

1213
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
That mission was scary.

1214
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
The wee...

1215
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Hog Raid?

1216
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
How creative!

1217
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm sore!

1218
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh my god, it really said no women are allowed to drive.

1219
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Wow, this game did not age well.

1220
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
That's terrible.

1221
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I shouldn't have said that.

1222
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Oh, wait.

1223
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
What?

1224
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Okay.

1225
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Right.

1226
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Am I just to get through the level

1227
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
without getting hurt?

1228
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I think I can do that.

1229
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Whee!

1230
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Oopsies.

1231
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Oh no, the pole!

1232
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It's a polis, lads.

1233
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It's a polis. Pause.

1234
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Right, who's got a bag on them?

1235
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I don't want to touch them.

1236
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Right, we're doing a jump kick.

1237
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Whee!

1238
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Oh wait, I'm fourth place.

1239
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I'm to beat these people?

1240
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Oh, oh no.

1241
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Oh no, this can't be.

1242
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I didn't realize I was actually racing.

1243
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I was just having fun driving, to be honest.

1244
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I just think this is a cool map.

1245
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Oh no.

1246
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I'm supposed to win.

1247
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Ah!

1248
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Okay, hold on.

1249
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Oh no, I lost!

1250
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
No, wait.

1251
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Oh no, why did I just break

1252
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
to let that guy go third?

1253
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Wait, I won though.

1254
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Oh no, I didn't win!

1255
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Oh no!

1256
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I have to actually win.

1257
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I was just having fun driving, not going to lie.

1258
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I was like, oh, this is actually a really

1259
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
fun wee game.

1260
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Oops.

1261
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Is there like a boost button?

1262
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Or is it literally just send it?

1263
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Okay, I'm just going for it.

1264
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I don't know if there's a sender.

1265
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I think I maybe have to hit all the green boost.

1266
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And it like guarantees you to go ahead

1267
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
of, whoa!

1268
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Crash, what are you doing?

1269
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
The steering crash!

1270
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh my god, there is like, no steering!

1271
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Ah!

1272
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Oh wait, I don't die if I hit them?

1273
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Okay.

1274
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Right, I'm third place.

1275
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I just need to hit all the green that comes up.

1276
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Uh...

1277
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Right.

1278
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
All right, hold on.

1279
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I'm looking for the green to get me ahead.

1280
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Crash, please stop skittin',

1281
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
skittin' a boot.

1282
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Okay, there's a green there.

1283
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Oh!

1284
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Get in my way!

1285
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Your ball back!

1286
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
No!

1287
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
No!

1288
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Right, again, again, again, again, again.

1289
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
He was in my way!

1290
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Right, try again. Go again, Crash.

1291
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Try again.

1292
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
He was in my way on the greenery.

1293
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
The green pads are the boost, yeah.

1294
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Right, let's freakin' try that again.

1295
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I feel like when I played this as a child,

1296
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
if I even got this far,

1297
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I probably would be crying right now.

1298
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You know how like kids cry in frustration

1299
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
when they can't win?

1300
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I feel like...

1301
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I'd be greeting right now.

1302
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Because I'm so bad at the game.

1303
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Would you laugh at

1304
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
a young, strongy crying right now?

1305
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Crying are we eyes out.

1306
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Right, I'm third place.

1307
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
There should be like

1308
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
three green speed-ups ahead.

1309
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I'm not going to break the boxes.

1310
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I'm wondering if that slows me down a bit.

1311
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Go ahead.

1312
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So that's me second place.

1313
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Okay.

1314
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Crash, you're going to have to put... Crash!

1315
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
No, wait, what must the...

1316
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It's Bioball here!

1317
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It's Bioball here!

1318
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I got first place!

1319
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Oh my god!

1320
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
We did it!

1321
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
We did it!

1322
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
We are the champions.

1323
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
There's no time

1324
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
for loses

1325
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
because we

1326
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
are the champions

1327
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
of the world.

1328
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It's Tim Tame.

1329
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Forget Tim Reader.

1330
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Oh no, not the Aussies.

1331
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Anything but the Australians.

1332
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
No, save us!

1333
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh.

1334
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Are you squidding me right now?

1335
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Jack, thank you for the tip. Well done, strongy.

1336
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Purple burglar alert.

1337
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I don't know, maybe not the farm.

1338
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Maybe go with the animal sanctuary rescue.

1339
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Thank you for the tip, Jack.

1340
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Oh my god, we're in Tim Tame's tomb.

1341
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Oh, look at the detail on the walls.

1342
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I'm sorry, but

1343
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
they don't

1344
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
make games like they used to.

1345
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Look at, wow, what is that?

1346
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
A Crocodonkey.

1347
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Right, go away.

1348
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It got my butthole!

1349
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I didn't even get a checkpoint.

1350
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
That's how

1351
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
not far into the game I was.

1352
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It got my butthole.

1353
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I'm so bad.

1354
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Right, big jump.

1355
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And then up the stairs.

1356
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And then jump.

1357
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Okay, let's find that thing.

1358
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
That was just bad timing.

1359
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Whoa!

1360
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
It's oil!

1361
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I'm really scared. Oh my god, it's made from Overwatch.

1362
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I can't believe they based this game on made from Overwatch.

1363
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Whoa!

1364
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Oh my god!

1365
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
She's so cute when she skates.

1366
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I love Coco.

1367
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Boom, boom, boom.

1368
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Look at the detail on the walls.

1369
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Uh...

1370
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Yeah, I saw that. I saw that.

1371
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I had video game knowledge to know something wasn't right there.

1372
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Brian!

1373
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Brian, but no message.

1374
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Thank you for the tip.

1375
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Brian, but no message.

1376
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Brian!

1377
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Don't tell America there's oil there.

1378
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
We're getting invaded.

1379
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Wait, there's TNT everywhere.

1380
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Oh, this is not going to go well for me.

1381
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Get me the heck out of here.

1382
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I'm not even just...

1383
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Does it blow off?

1384
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Okay, it just blows up TNT in the vicinity.

1385
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Okay, that's fine.

1386
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Oh no, I'm scared.

1387
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I'm hiding.

1388
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Something just went flying.

1389
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I don't know what, but...

1390
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Thank you for the tip, Brian.

1391
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Okay.

1392
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Yeah, I knew there was something up there,

1393
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
but I didn't want to jump on it

1394
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
because I got scared.

1395
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Oh wait, I could have barely flopped on the other side of the map.

1396
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Oops.

1397
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I can't believe it.

1398
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I'm not an MLG gamer.

1399
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
What's this?

1400
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Oh, it's a time.

1401
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Oh my god, it's the Anka symbol.

1402
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Is that a Gen 2 reference?

1403
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Eh? I need to jump over this?

1404
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Okay, I can do that.

1405
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
See you, yo, bam.

1406
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Great.

1407
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Oh no.

1408
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Oh, I got...

1409
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I heard the...

1410
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
What did you hear?

1411
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Am I a vampire?

1412
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Are you squiddling here?

1413
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Ah!

1414
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Ah.

1415
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
That's a trick.

1416
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
The Dinger, thank you for the five.

1417
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
You know what?

1418
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I actually was in trade.

1419
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I can't do it this month or maybe next month.

1420
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
However, I am so down to do...

1421
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
like...

1422
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
what?

1423
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I am so down to do

1424
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
showing off game dev type.

1425
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
How the heck did I get over there?

1426
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I cannot make that jump. I know that for a fact.

1427
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I'm so down to do that

1428
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
to give game devs that are smaller

1429
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
a bigger chance type thing.

1430
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And we write a little review.

1431
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
We write a little review at the end.

1432
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Oh no.

1433
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Oh no, this can't be.

1434
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Look at all the paint.

1435
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Look at the detail.

1436
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
They're implying that they're painting the murals right now.

1437
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Look!

1438
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It's so fun and cute.

1439
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Thank you again for the five by Dinger.

1440
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
How do I do this?

1441
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Is it a timer?

1442
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I don't know.

1443
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Okay, it's a timer.

1444
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Do not be distracted from the fact that it's a timer.

1445
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
As beautiful as the game's...

1446
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
The game's

1447
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
background

1448
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
storytelling is the thingy.

1449
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It is a timer, so do not be fooled.

1450
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Wait until it gets close to you, okay?

1451
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Wait until it gets close to you.

1452
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Oh!

1453
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Right, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1454
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Child's game absolutely

1455
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
decimating me.

1456
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Oh my god.

1457
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Growing women beaten to pulp

1458
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
via child's game.

1459
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Once it opens, then just go straight for it.

1460
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Right.

1461
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I'll wait until that comes back.

1462
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Because, yeah.

1463
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Unless Coco can just stand on this.

1464
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Okay, yeah.

1465
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Okay, we're safe, we're safe.

1466
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
We're safe.

1467
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Wait!

1468
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Wait, how am I supposed to get around that?

1469
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Oh wait, no!

1470
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
There's a life back there!

1471
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Okay, that's what I need.

1472
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Yes.

1473
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
That sounded terrible.

1474
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I said I need a lifter.

1475
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Right, we've got a checkpoint.

1476
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Right, go!

1477
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Uh-huh.

1478
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Oh no!

1479
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Coco!

1480
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Coco!

1481
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Right, no wonder there's a freaking checkpoint there.

1482
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Coco, what was that abysmal attempt?

1483
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
You know exactly what you were doing, hen.

1484
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You, Karrish.

1485
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Whoa.

1486
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Flamethrower's a bit dramatic.

1487
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
This is a child's game.

1488
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Wow!

1489
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I'm scared!

1490
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Oh Coco!

1491
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I'm scared.

1492
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Oh, get me off this level.

1493
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I hate platforming like that.

1494
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Oh, get me off, get me off, get me off.

1495
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Oh, another portal we go.

1496
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Safety, safety.

1497
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Only time's strong to get smashed.

1498
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Reflens, are you not coming to the convention?

1499
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Hold on a minute.

1500
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Hold on, this is news to me.

1501
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Right, no, I played that one.

1502
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
And I just did that one, didn't I?

1503
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Okay.

1504
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So we're gonna play

1505
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Midnight Run.

1506
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Okay, Midnight Run.

1507
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Midnight Run.

1508
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
What's my tiger called?

1509
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I'm sure my tiger has a name.

1510
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Oh my God!

1511
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
He's so cute!

1512
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I can't handle it.

1513
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Tiger confirmed for Jin too.

1514
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Oh my God!

1515
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You're so cute!

1516
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Oh my God, jump, jump high.

1517
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Oh, there's a lot of enemies up here.

1518
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Oh, jump!

1519
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Oh, check mark.

1520
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And jump.

1521
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Jump food.

1522
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Oh, I love this freaking tiger so much.

1523
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Oh my God, why am I doing so much better on later levels

1524
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
than I am on the early level?

1525
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Oh my God!

1526
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
You're cheatsy doodle!

1527
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Did you see that?

1528
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Oh my God, I cheatsy doodle!

1529
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

1530
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Right, checkpoint, checkpoint.

1531
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Jump.

1532
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I saw that.

1533
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I saw what the game was trying to do.

1534
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I'm tryharding on this level.

1535
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I don't care.

1536
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I love it.

1537
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And I love me tiger.

1538
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Love me cocoa.

1539
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Love me China wall.

1540
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Simplest.

1541
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Oh my God!

1542
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
This freaking best level ever!

1543
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I know.

1544
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Jump, jump, sled, sled.

1545
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I love the tiger.

1546
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Jin won, you won for now.

1547
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
It's 100k.

1548
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
What, steady on, steady on.

1549
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
No, I think I'll hold him for a while.

1550
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Trying to be gaming like a pro?

1551
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I freaking love!

1552
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Oh no, we're doing a boss fight.

1553
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Cola check.

1554
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Everyone hydrate.

1555
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
We're about to do a boss fight.

1556
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
The tiger's called Pura?

1557
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Oh my God, Jin to confirm tiger girl called Pura.

1558
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I'm not even care.

1559
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Oh, I've just tabbed out.

1560
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
That was a terrible idea.

1561
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Sorry, I just tabbed out of the game.

1562
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I got a DM.

1563
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Okay, I have, I have good news for everyone.

1564
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I don't, I have good news for everyone.

1565
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Mercy and Aisy's meme ASMR are going up today.

1566
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I just got confirmation from the squadron.

1567
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Dingo Dale.

1568
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
A Dingo Dale.

1569
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
A Dingo Dale.

1570
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Oh my God, that's such an Aussie name.

1571
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Oh my God, they said no whammin' fights.

1572
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yay!

1573
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
A tiger girl called Pura.

1574
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura.

1575
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Them crystals are mine.

1576
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Call me Pura.

1577
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Oh, it's a...

1578
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Break out the butter.

1579
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Uh, uh, what?

1580
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
What is this?

1581
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Um...

1582
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Hmm?

1583
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I don't...

1584
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I don't understand how he auto-locked me.

1585
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Oh, he did it again!

1586
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1587
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Hold on, sorry, sorry.

1588
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm looking, I'm looking where his gun is pointing.

1589
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Sorry, give me, give me a second.

1590
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It takes me a second to figure things out for myself.

1591
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Hold on, hold on.

1592
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
My brain isn't hot wires like the way it's hot wired for you.

1593
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Right, he's aiming there.

1594
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Ah!

1595
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
He keeps aiming!

1596
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Now what?

1597
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Oh, he keeps going.

1598
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Oh!

1599
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Please don't do that.

1600
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Oh!

1601
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Please don't do that!

1602
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I'm trying to hurt him.

1603
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Okay.

1604
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Oh.

1605
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Okay, I just need to do that three times.

1606
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Okay, okay.

1607
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I just needed a second to digest what the game is asking me to do.

1608
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
That's all.

1609
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I just needed a tricky second.

1610
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Right, if he just keeps all locking,

1611
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I could probably just keep going like this.

1612
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Oh, no.

1613
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Okay.

1614
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Twat him?

1615
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Okay, okay.

1616
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.

1617
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1618
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Last one, boys.

1619
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I just need to look on the ground.

1620
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
No.

1621
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Oh no, does he do a variation attack?

1622
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Oh.

1623
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Okay, nice and easy.

1624
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
We did it, we did it, we did it.

1625
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Unless we need to do anything special, I think that's good.

1626
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Oh my God, he let you win.

1627
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
With a Higgy or then?

1628
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah, get him, Penguin!

1629
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Beat his ass, Penguin.

1630
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
We'll do it together.

1631
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
No one will do it.

1632
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah, beat him up, beat him up.

1633
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
We love penguins in here.

1634
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Gen 2 penguin confirmed.

1635
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Double jump.

1636
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Yes, a jump twice as high.

1637
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Okay, I can probably replay those other missions if I so desired.

1638
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
No.

1639
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Oh my God, look at that vertical leap.

1640
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Look at that vertical leap.

1641
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Get me in the NBAs right now, NBAs.

1642
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
NBA?

1643
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
NBA.

1644
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Get me in the NBAs right now.

1645
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Coco, show us that double jump.

1646
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Wow, look at that.

1647
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
She's a cheerleader.

1648
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Oh my God, she's such a cheerleader.

1649
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Right, we're going to change the turn.

1650
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Let's go.

1651
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Right, what are we eating first?

1652
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Baggies from Dim Sum's.

1653
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
We're doing the Dano Mate.

1654
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Oh my God, that's such a good name for a TNT dinosaur.

1655
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Oh my God, Gen 2 confirmed.

1656
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Sorry, I'm just stealing all my Gen 2 ideas from Crash Bandicoot.

1657
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I don't mind if I do.

1658
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
A pair of Pate Marsupials.

1659
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I am Dr. Nefarious Trope.

1660
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Master of Time and the creator of the very time twister machine you see before you.

1661
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Uka Uka and Dr. Cortex have sent me to end this little shroud.

1662
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
So you won't be leaving my area with the crystals?

1663
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I swear it.

1664
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Wow, this game is so fun.

1665
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Thank you for watching.

1666
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
No, no, no.

1667
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Is that what I think it is?

1668
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Is this going to be a chase sequence?

1669
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I take it all back.

1670
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Is this a chase sequence?

1671
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Oh my God, I can like clear those with ease.

1672
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
What the heck is that?

1673
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Honestly, honestly.

1674
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Oh, that's lava.

1675
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
That's not a path.

1676
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Oh my goodness.

1677
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
My brain literally registered that last second.

1678
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh my God, this looks like a chase sequence map.

1679
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
See it ain't so.

1680
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I will not go turn the lights off.

1681
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Carry me home.

1682
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Oh my God, that fish is so freaky.

1683
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
It's supposed to look like crash, isn't it?

1684
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I'm not just making that up.

1685
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Oh, go away.

1686
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Oh, go away.

1687
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
You're so creepy.

1688
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Oh, I'm scared.

1689
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I don't like it.

1690
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Wait, why are you not possible?

1691
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
That's the second one that's not possible.

1692
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I wonder why that's not possible.

1693
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Wow, the grass slowed me down.

1694
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
No.

1695
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Oh, I stood on its head.

1696
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Oh, it's like Mario.

1697
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
If you stand on its head, it's gone.

1698
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It's dead if you stand on it.

1699
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Wait, what does the egg do?

1700
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Hello.

1701
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
We kissed the egg and let it germinate.

1702
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Am I supposed to break it?

1703
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I really don't want to break it.

1704
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I feel like I was really mean.

1705
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I don't want to break the egg.

1706
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I'm sorry.

1707
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
There's something germinating inside it.

1708
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
We want it to wish it success.

1709
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Great success in your life.

1710
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Break the egg.

1711
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I don't want it.

1712
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
There's something living inside it.

1713
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
If you...

1714
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Although saying that, you can actually grow chickens

1715
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
without their shell or being cracked open.

1716
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I don't actually recommend you doing it, but...

1717
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
What?

1718
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Did you see that?

1719
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
How big that thing was?

1720
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Go away.

1721
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
No egg breakie.

1722
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:02,000
We are nice to nature.

1723
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1724
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Oh, the music is so good.

1725
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I love children's games.

1726
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I love them being relatively easy.

1727
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Yeah, that's right.

1728
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I'm smart at that segment.

1729
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I knew exactly what you were going to ask me.

1730
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Bonus mission.

1731
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
You got a break here.

1732
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Break egg.

1733
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Help it hatch.

1734
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Oh, I'm to help it hatch?

1735
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Oh, that's different then.

1736
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Okay, I'll break the eggs when I see them.

1737
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Wow.

1738
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Butt smash.

1739
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Oh, I missed that one back there.

1740
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
That's okay.

1741
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Butt smash.

1742
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Wow.

1743
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Oh, that's like so many wumper fruit.

1744
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And a life, which I definitely mean how much I'm...

1745
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Oh, I can't reach it.

1746
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I couldn't reach it anyway.

1747
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Oh, well.

1748
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Oh, well.

1749
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Wee.

1750
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Let's go.

1751
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
We're strong and we weave.

1752
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
You don't get excited.

1753
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
No, I saw it.

1754
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I saw it.

1755
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Did you see it too?

1756
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I saw the Terran and Zoran ring.

1757
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I have double jump.

1758
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Okay.

1759
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Okay.

1760
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Trust in the double jump.

1761
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Okay.

1762
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Wow, you're going so fast.

1763
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I have double jump and I still feel that jump.

1764
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Wow.

1765
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh, cool, cool.

1766
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
This camera angle isn't helping, darling.

1767
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Yes, a bear camera angle, please.

1768
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Oh, please give us a bear camera angle.

1769
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Oh, get me out of here.

1770
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Oh, my God.

1771
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
How are you supposed to know what's coming up?

1772
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
How are you supposed to know?

1773
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
No more dino missions, please.

1774
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
My heart can't take it.

1775
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I'm getting so stressed out.

1776
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Deep trouble.

1777
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Okay, my time.

1778
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
We still call that a skill issue.

1779
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Okay.

1780
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Okay, you're done.

1781
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Back to the...

1782
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1783
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
You need reaction time.

1784
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I don't have reaction time, though.

1785
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
What?

1786
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Can I go up?

1787
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
No, sorry.

1788
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,000
The game almost looked like I could go up.

1789
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Okay, let's hope I don't mess this up.

1790
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Too much.

1791
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I'm just going to spam.

1792
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Oh, my God.

1793
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yes, spamming.

1794
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Why did you not get hit?

1795
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Well, I'll leave you alive.

1796
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
But tell your family.

1797
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I almost got electric shock.

1798
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Oh, my God.

1799
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Actually, I'm so sorry if you get sick of that meme.

1800
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It's probably the funniest thing I enjoy right now.

1801
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
It's just full going, oh, my God.

1802
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
This character confirmed.

1803
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I don't know.

1804
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I just find it really funny.

1805
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Okay, I can beat up sharks underwater.

1806
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Oh, my God.

1807
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I'm stuck in a vortex.

1808
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Oh, my God.

1809
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Okay, it's fine.

1810
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
We made it.

1811
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
We made it.

1812
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Wow.

1813
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I like the tissues are just hanging out in this one winter thing.

1814
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Oh, God, that was two for one.

1815
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Oh, my God.

1816
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Crash Bandicoot really said inflation.

1817
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Inflation confirmed for gender.

1818
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I'm so sorry.

1819
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Oh, I did it twice.

1820
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Oh, my God.

1821
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I'm so sorry.

1822
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Please excuse me by all means.

1823
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Right.

1824
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Let's not do that again.

1825
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Spin.

1826
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Right.

1827
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
There.

1828
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Jeez.

1829
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Why was that so hard?

1830
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Crystal does, but does it like a locker bonus thing for me later?

1831
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I'm just using my damage to get out.

1832
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Whoa.

1833
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I didn't even see that.

1834
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Literally spinning damage helps you move so much faster.

1835
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Inflation.

1836
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Wow.

1837
01:19:41,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I don't have a mask right now, so this is extra scary.

1838
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Right.

1839
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I didn't know you died in the vortex.

1840
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Oh, no.

1841
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
How far back am I?

1842
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I lost me boat a wee bit ago.

1843
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I'm just spamming.

1844
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Am I going crazy?

1845
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
No.

1846
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Oh, my God.

1847
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
We're going to the rapture bio shot confirmed.

1848
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Oh, wait.

1849
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I can just destroy the natural boxes when I'm like this.

1850
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
That's fine.

1851
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Oh, no.

1852
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Why am I so bad at timing?

1853
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I made it.

1854
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I made it.

1855
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I made it.

1856
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Oh, right.

1857
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Okay.

1858
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I literally perished right before the end of that level.

1859
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
You need the purple crystals to unlock the boss.

1860
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Okay.

1861
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Bioshock.

1862
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I know.

1863
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Literally.

1864
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I'm sorry.

1865
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It's my favorite joke right now because I have had messages like that that have been

1866
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
like, you said this in one stream.

1867
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Does that mean?

1868
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Is this the?

1869
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Oh, my God.

1870
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Wait.

1871
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Can the girl drive?

1872
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Girl can't drive.

1873
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Wow.

1874
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Wow.

1875
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
You mean a big sister?

1876
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Oh, we don't have a big sister, do we?

1877
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,000
We do have a mama.

1878
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Maybe we should do like a cousin third removed for Gentoo.

1879
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Oh, no.

1880
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I'm terrible at the different people.

1881
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Oh, no.

1882
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Okay.

1883
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Let's get to it.

1884
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Everybody.

1885
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Let's get to it.

1886
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
To it.

1887
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Let's get them 40s popping.

1888
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Right.

1889
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Wait.

1890
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
They can use the ramps.

1891
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I thought they can use the ramps.

1892
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I thought only I could.

1893
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
That's how I was like predicting where they were going to go.

1894
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Go away.

1895
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
No.

1896
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Get out my way.

1897
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
This is my road.

1898
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Oh, my God.

1899
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Sorry.

1900
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It's like, wait.

1901
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I don't even know where the controls are.

1902
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I'm sliding if I do a.

1903
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I'm definitely lost this one.

1904
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
That's all I'm going to say.

1905
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
We are going to play.

1906
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
We are replaying this for as long.

1907
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I don't know what the controls are.

1908
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Can someone tell me what the controls are?

1909
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Because I'm holding like, oh, I'm a, but I'm like, well, no.

1910
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I'm holding right trigger, but it keeps making me slide everywhere.

1911
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
And that just instantly stopped my speed.

1912
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
What is going on?

1913
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I'm confusion.

1914
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I'm, I'm a philosopher because I'm Confucius.

1915
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
What the heck?

1916
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Bro.

1917
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Stop sliding.

1918
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Crash.

1919
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Crash.

1920
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
What is going on?

1921
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yeah.

1922
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I've definitely haven't won this one.

1923
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Get out of my way.

1924
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I'll rearrange you and make it look like an accident.

1925
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Wait.

1926
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I don't know what.

1927
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Sorry.

1928
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I'm going to have to look up the controls for this game mode because I'm definitely doing

1929
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
something wrong.

1930
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Like crash speeds up and then he slows down.

1931
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Wait.

1932
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I'm not.

1933
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I don't have any turning power when he does that.

1934
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Crash.

1935
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Crash.

1936
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Crash.

1937
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Our insurance bill is going to be.

1938
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Oh, wait.

1939
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Whoa.

1940
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
They really said Mario Kart out here.

1941
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Yeah.

1942
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
They said if you fall off the map, it's fine.

1943
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Whoa.

1944
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Controls just accelerate.

1945
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I just accelerated and got sixth place.

1946
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,000
So something tells me I'm doing something wrong.

1947
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Strongly confirmed for Gen 2.

1948
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I need first to progress to the next mission.

1949
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Guys, I have a terrible feeling we're going to be here.

1950
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
She's got ran over.

1951
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Did you see that?

1952
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Insurance fraud simulator on a flu.

1953
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
She's got ran over.

1954
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Oh my God.

1955
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Child's game.

1956
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It's okay.

1957
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You're sixth place, but we still love you.

1958
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Literally green.

1959
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Is it?

1960
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Is there?

1961
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Accelerate just before a green light to boost.

1962
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
One, two, boost.

1963
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
That.

1964
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Okay.

1965
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Hold on a minute.

1966
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
We're getting strats.

1967
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I managed to read the help screen.

1968
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Okay.

1969
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Okay.

1970
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Let him get up.

1971
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Let him get up.

1972
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Get out my way.

1973
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Right.

1974
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Everyone's doing that, but I actually don't know if you're slower on ramps or not.

1975
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Right.

1976
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Okay.

1977
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Hold up.

1978
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Hold up.

1979
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Hold up.

1980
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Hold up.

1981
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
We're getting there.

1982
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
We're getting there.

1983
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
If you cross the road right now, you're such a vampire.

1984
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You're actually such a freaking idiot.

1985
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
He purposely, can I reset?

1986
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Because there's no way I'm going to win.

1987
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Resume.

1988
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Oh, you can't reset.

1989
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
He's such a liar.

1990
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Literally swerving into me.

1991
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I'm faster.

1992
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I really don't feel it.

1993
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Why are all these cops on the road?

1994
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I know.

1995
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Literally.

1996
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Meet her springs out here with the cop hiding behind the billboard to catch Lightning McQueen.

1997
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
What's that?

1998
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I know the lore of freaking cars.

1999
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Yeah.

2000
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
What are you going to do about it?

2001
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Wait.

2002
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Oh my God.

2003
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Car girl confirmed for Gen 2, but you get to stick it in her exhaust pipe.

2004
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Oh my God.

2005
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Did you guys see that thing on YouTube where the guy's in love with his car?

2006
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,000
It was like my weird obsession and he makes love to his car and it's red.

2007
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I just remember the car being red and me being like, huh?

2008
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Huh?

2009
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Okay.

2010
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
We're actually somehow doing better even though I've played considerably worse.

2011
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Yeah.

2012
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Like he keeps going off the map.

2013
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I don't know why.

2014
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
The A.

2015
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Ah!

2016
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Okay.

2017
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Well, I'm still, excuse me, insurance fraud people on the phone right now.

2018
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Oh my God.

2019
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Why did they make this so hard?

2020
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I just got ran over again.

2021
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Right.

2022
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Hold on.

2023
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Let me look up the controls because I don't think anyone...

2024
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It said two things to me when I played the game mode for the first time.

2025
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Hold on.

2026
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Crash.

2027
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Bandicoot warped.

2028
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
What is this?

2029
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Motorcycle controls.

2030
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Xbox.

2031
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I'll put Xbox because I'm using Xbox controller.

2032
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Hold down the X button to accelerate and square to break.

2033
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I said Xbox controls.

2034
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
We don't have a square.

2035
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So it's literally breaking go.

2036
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It's literally just breaking go and that's it.

2037
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
What is accelerate?

2038
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Is A accelerate?

2039
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I guess A is accelerate.

2040
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Right.

2041
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And then I just need to focus on not...

2042
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Oh my!

2043
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Oh!

2044
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And we don't even have an option to reset.

2045
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I don't know if I'd be faster to reset and then go again.

2046
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Bra.

2047
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Literally.

2048
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Get out my way, honestly.

2049
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Can the game tell that I'm a struggling child and then the AI will lower?

2050
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
You know how some of those games have like reflective AI and they're like,

2051
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
oh my God, you're struggling.

2052
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
We're just going to lower the game difficulty for you.

2053
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Can I have that please?

2054
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I'm literally struggling so hard.

2055
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Right.

2056
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Stop drifting crash.

2057
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
It's causing a lot of issues.

2058
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
It's causing a lot of issues.

2059
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

2060
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Can you stop?

2061
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Oh!

2062
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Right.

2063
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Right.

2064
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Right.

2065
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Right.

2066
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Right.

2067
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I get it.

2068
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I get it.

2069
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Crash!

2070
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Crash.

2071
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Oh!

2072
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Well, I'm actually going to have a word with you once the stream is over.

2073
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Oh my God.

2074
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Can I really not progress?

2075
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Wait, I'm going to back out and see if I can just skip to the next level

2076
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
because oh my God.

2077
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
And there's so many police on the road and they're not even doing their job.

2078
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
You're not even a civil servant.

2079
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
You're not even serving the public at all just hanging about on Route 66 for any reason.

2080
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Honestly.

2081
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Nay wonder, like folk call themselves a sovereign citizen.

2082
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
You ain't doing shit.

2083
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
No again, please.

2084
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Oh my God.

2085
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Please.

2086
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Okay.

2087
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I'm going to back out and I'm going to see if we can progress to the next thing

2088
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
because this is impossible.

2089
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Nay wonder, Coco.

2090
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Right.

2091
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
No.

2092
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Don't restart level.

2093
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Give me a break.

2094
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Let me come back to it.

2095
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Let me come back to it because I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

2096
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I don't know how I'm supposed to do it.

2097
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Right.

2098
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
We're not doing road crash more like right.

2099
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Hang time.

2100
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So what did I just do?

2101
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
12.

2102
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
No.

2103
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
What?

2104
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Okay.

2105
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
We're doing 15.

2106
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Oh wow.

2107
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
It does let you skip ahead.

2108
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Thank God.

2109
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
You need that crystal.

2110
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
No.

2111
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Eh?

2112
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Go away.

2113
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Wait.

2114
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Oh.

2115
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Okay.

2116
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:20,000
You can't even do anything against these guys at all.

2117
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
How did I...

2118
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I didn't want to break it but hey ho.

2119
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Oh.

2120
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
You don't get anything out of them?

2121
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Right.

2122
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I can definitely do this.

2123
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Whee.

2124
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
What?

2125
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Who put all this poison to turn the fricking frogs game?

2126
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
There's...

2127
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Wait.

2128
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
How am I supposed to get past?

2129
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Oh my gosh.

2130
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
That was like so close.

2131
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I'm sorry.

2132
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I don't know what the hitbox is like in this game.

2133
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
But I'm feeling it Mr. Krabs.

2134
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Oh okay.

2135
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I was just going to belly flop.

2136
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Well that wasn't worth it.

2137
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Swing.

2138
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Swing.

2139
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
And then get past.

2140
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Okay.

2141
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
We're doing it.

2142
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
We're doing it.

2143
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
It's fine.

2144
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
It's fine.

2145
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
So if I do this...

2146
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
No that's not...

2147
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I don't really want to set it all.

2148
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Wah.

2149
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Oh shit.

2150
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I thought I had enough distance to do that.

2151
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Okay.

2152
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I won't do that again.

2153
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I'll leave the TNT as is.

2154
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I don't need anything from the TNT.

2155
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Two.

2156
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
One.

2157
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Jump.

2158
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Swing.

2159
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Wah.

2160
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
It almost perished.

2161
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Right.

2162
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
We're leaving TNT alone because I don't know how to deal with it.

2163
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I ain't smart enough for this.

2164
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Swing.

2165
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Bouncy bouncy down.

2166
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Right.

2167
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't need that.

2168
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I don't really know what to do with it either but I don't need it.

2169
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Go to the farm.

2170
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Right now.

2171
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
No.

2172
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
There's a mage.

2173
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Come on away.

2174
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Bouncy bouncy down.

2175
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Farm!

2176
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Farm!

2177
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,000
We need lots of floats so they can help with

2178
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
the pests in the garden.

2179
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Okay.

2180
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
We can do special missions.

2181
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
How to stay ininal for mages.

2182
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:50,680
it's because they have an auto lock and I don't like auto locking just so you know

Holy crap.

2222
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,600
I am so sorry if anyone's name is Crash.

01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,080
You're adrenaline must be pumping right now.

2224
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,040
Holy crap.

2225
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:45,880
First try.

2226
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:48,320
Yes, that was my first attempt on that map.

2227
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:52,040
Thank you for admitting how amazing.

2228
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,880
Wait, did I forget to do a mission?

2229
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,560
Did I forget to do a mission?

2230
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,520
Oh, I forgot to do a mission completely.

2231
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,640
OK, sorry, we need to do hang time.

2232
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,760
I completely forgot to just do an entire mission.

2233
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,360
My apologies.

2234
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:19,080
Well, you've crashed a few parties before,

2235
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:22,600
but I never expected you to make it this far.

2236
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:25,000
If you don't turn back.

2237
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,920
Yeah, I've lived the thousand years

2238
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:31,440
as the flag of you, and the entire universe.

2239
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,000
OK.

2240
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,920
OK, I can do this.

2241
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:39,560
I can do it.

2242
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,000
And these kind of maps are.

2243
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,960
Molotov cocktails.

2244
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,040
I'm sorry, but there's something

2245
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:49,560
about the Geneva Convention with that.

2246
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:51,200
What's going on here?

2247
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,560
Oh my God.

2248
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,920
A magic carpet ride.

2249
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,760
Oh.

2250
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,080
Did I just get put in a jar?

2251
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,480
Oh, wait, I forgot these guys.

2252
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,120
So Molotovs already.

2253
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:11,800
And a magic carpet ride.

2254
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:27,000
Oh, I can hardly see that as it comes over.

2255
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,640
All right, give me a checkpoint because it's not looking good.

2256
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:33,320
OK, wow.

2257
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,520
Isn't this not?

2258
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:40,080
No, I'm going to put back here.

2259
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,400
This is so far away.

2260
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,320
I better get a checkpoint right now.

2261
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:46,680
Give me a checkpoint right now.

2262
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,920
And me figure when?

2263
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,640
Go away.

2264
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:57,480
And me a figurine.

2265
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:01,160
You'll have to like and subscribe a bit more for a figurine.

2266
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,600
The thing when right.

2267
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,200
OK, sorry, I'm getting distracted.

2268
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,680
And if you guys are like serious,

2269
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,600
but like, oh, when can we get this particular merch?

2270
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,080
That particular merch.

2271
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:16,160
The sad thing is I have to message these companies

2272
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:20,360
and then I basically have to go, here's the statistics.

2273
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,120
Here's.

2274
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,600
Oh, I almost perished there.

2275
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,600
And it's like I can't go to a company to produce like merchandise.

2276
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,240
It's like a lot of money.

2277
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:33,080
And and sorry, let me try hard.

2278
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,400
So OK, that's fine.

2279
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:40,920
We got the checkpoint.

2280
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:45,360
And and I basically I can't ask for like this merchandise

2281
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,440
that costs like thousands to be produced.

2282
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,320
If it's like, yeah, we've got 4,000 subscribers,

2283
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,000
like it's just not happening.

2284
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,320
And so, you know, if you ever want to support your girls,

2285
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,120
just make some clips of them go viral or something.

2286
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:00,800
I don't know.

2287
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,400
OK, holy crap.

2288
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,800
Wow, this is a risky map.

2289
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,480
I'm not going to lie.

2290
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:07,200
Oh, bonus map.

2291
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,200
Bonus time.

2292
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,280
They need a minimum guaranteed return on investment.

2293
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:17,560
Yes, like Uber market and we're absolutely fantastic

2294
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:22,760
because to get to get.

2295
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,200
I completely forgot I can double jump half the time.

2296
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,560
Wait, I don't know.

2297
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,040
Oh, there we go.

2298
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,000
And I'm not.

2299
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,640
I don't want to accidentally fall off the map, to be honest.

2300
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,040
I'm quite happy just to move on.

2301
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,240
And yeah, like you need to go to the company

2302
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,600
and be like, this is what we do.

2303
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,280
And this is why we're a good fit for you here

2304
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:55,640
as a statistic to back up, like, you know, such and.

2305
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,720
And oh, right.

2306
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:00,320
Give me that.

2307
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:04,040
You go away.

2308
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,520
I didn't realize there's flamethrowers here.

2309
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:09,600
What's that death?

2310
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,080
Do I want to go on that one?

2311
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:14,240
I did just hit a checkpoint.

2312
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:17,040
Oh, no.

2313
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,040
Oh, no, I just said luck to an achievement for that.

2314
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,080
OK, get viral, get viral, get viral.

2315
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,160
Yes.

2316
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:24,720
And like, as I said, Uber market

2317
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:28,200
were fantastic because they gave three designs.

2318
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:31,120
Like, they made three designs for the girls.

2319
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,400
And it was like, the girls aren't even out.

2320
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:37,000
We had absolutely no idea what the estimations

2321
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,080
were looking like or the success or whatever.

2322
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,720
And we were much.

2323
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,480
No wonder they call it the death route.

2324
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:47,880
Right, I'm not doing that again.

2325
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,320
I don't think it's imperative to the clock.

2326
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:53,120
Oh, yeah, no, I'm not fussing for the death route.

2327
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:54,760
Wee.

2328
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,200
Why has it got random TNT?

2329
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:00,840
You got an A. But, yeah, they were like, yeah,

2330
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:05,640
you can have three designs, which was fantastic.

2331
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:11,800
And if all, oh, wait, I don't want to touch that

2332
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,640
because it's TNT.

2333
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,400
The guys just throwing swords over there.

2334
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,040
Oh, checkpoint.

2335
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:24,920
All right, hold on.

2336
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:25,600
Jump.

2337
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,120
Belly float.

2338
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,960
Oh, wait, that's TNT there.

2339
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,320
So it doesn't blow.

2340
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:35,840
Oh, go away.

2341
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:36,840
You're so creepy.

2342
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:40,880
Oh, yeah.

2343
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,240
Is this?

2344
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,160
Are you going to?

2345
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:50,280
Sugar, that hurt me.

2346
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,480
That's OK.

2347
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,000
Um.

2348
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,880
Oh, I don't like the look of that.

2349
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:04,360
Oh, I'm not even in range of it.

2350
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,960
Oh, my God, his mouth like being wide open.

2351
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,040
While he's climbing.

2352
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:11,440
Oh, thank God, get me off this map.

2353
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,200
You have to complete them to get the best ending.

2354
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:18,040
Isn't there not only one ending where you win this crash

2355
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:20,800
pancake game was like that.

2356
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:28,560
But I've all met up with this enemy doctor entropy.

2357
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,360
Isn't entropy when you're like skinny?

2358
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,600
I'm not thinking of something.

2359
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:42,760
Ah, you little vermin are way too stupid to understand

2360
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:45,000
what you're getting yourself into.

2361
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,160
This time, you've done it.

2362
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,240
Wahaa.

2363
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:54,280
Entrophy.

2364
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:57,280
There's usually a special 100% completion ending.

2365
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:02,960
Uh, jump.

2366
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:03,760
What does that mean?

2367
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:06,200
What does that mean?

2368
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:06,920
What does it mean?

2369
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,040
I don't know.

2370
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:08,520
Woo.

2371
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,680
Oh.

2372
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:19,680
Take that, you scallywag.

2373
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,680
Ah, OK, OK, OK, OK.

2374
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:22,680
Whoa.

2375
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:26,680
Oh, my God, the music.

2376
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:33,680
Oh.

2377
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:40,680
I actually really like that the boss fights aren't that hard.

2378
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:41,680
Like, I said it.

2379
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:42,680
I'm sorry, I said it.

2380
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,680
Sorry if this is going to age terribly,

2381
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:46,680
and I'm going to struggle with the next boss fight.

2382
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:48,680
But I think this is lovely.

2383
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:51,680
Like, this is a lovely experience.

2384
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,680
I spoke far too soon.

2385
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:03,680
I apologize for my ignorance.

2386
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:04,680
I do.

2387
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:05,680
I spoke far too soon.

2388
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:06,680
I admit it.

2389
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:08,680
I confess to my sins.

2390
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,680
All right, let's try that again.

2391
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:14,680
OK, let's try that again.

2392
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:17,680
I never made it this far into the game as a child.

2393
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:22,680
I don't think I did either, because I am,

2394
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:26,680
I don't recall anything past Coco.

2395
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,680
I just think that only remember Coco.

2396
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:33,680
OK.

2397
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,680
OK.

2398
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:41,680
OK, OK.

2399
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,680
Right, this time, don't let the missile go to my head.

2400
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:46,680
So that'd be great.

2401
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:52,680
OK.

2402
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:55,680
Wow, I almost jumped into that.

2403
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:01,680
Honestly, him laughing is so mean.

2404
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:05,680
Like, if I was an evil person.

2405
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,680
Take this!

2406
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,680
To spin longer and faster,

2407
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:25,680
or to glide while in the air, press X repeatedly.

2408
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:30,680
Wow, I love that move.

2409
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:34,680
First try, yeah, yeah, first try.

2410
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:35,680
First try.

2411
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:36,680
First try.

2412
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:37,680
Shhh.

2413
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,680
Is he trying to...

2414
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,680
Is he trying to guilt-trap us into losing?

2415
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:06,680
Who knows what it'll do?

2416
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:07,680
Oh, no.

2417
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,680
Right, let's go back to being a lady,

2418
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:11,680
because we did the dread one, isn't she?

2419
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:14,680
OK, we're going to Egypt to Arabia.

2420
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,680
The Sphinxinator.

2421
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:25,680
I want to explore your Sphinxinator.

2422
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:32,680
Oh my God, is this just going to the left side of the map now?

2423
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,680
From that previous map?

2424
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,680
No, it's not.

2425
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,680
It's just me making stuff up.

2426
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:37,680
I'm sorry.

2427
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,680
Second gen Sphinxinator.

2428
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,680
Confirmed, honestly.

2429
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:45,680
I'm sorry, it's not...

2430
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:46,680
Wow!

2431
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,680
A sarcophagus!

2432
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:51,680
Ah!

2433
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:52,680
A mummy!

2434
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,680
And not the good kind like Azura.

2435
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:57,680
Wow.

2436
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:58,680
Wow.

2437
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:02,680
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

2438
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:03,680
Who?

2439
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:07,680
OK, that was terrible, Taibin.

2440
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:10,680
Can we get like a crossbow, maybe?

2441
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,680
OK, let's try that again.

2442
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:15,680
I don't know when I was supposed to jump for him.

2443
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,680
I ain't gonna lie.

2444
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:20,680
Maybe I was supposed to double jump over the flames, right?

2445
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:21,680
You?

2446
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:22,680
And then a mummy?

2447
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,680
OK, that's fine.

2448
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:29,680
Return the slime.

2449
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:32,680
Watching you play this makes me want to get...

2450
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,680
Spiral.

2451
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:37,680
I've never played Spiral, but people were recommending it.

2452
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,680
And I was like, I might give it a shot.

2453
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,680
Give me checkpoint, please.

2454
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:43,680
But let the doors close first,

2455
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,680
because I was 100% gonna fall for that.

2456
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:53,680
Hold on, I want the spikes to go up.

2457
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:55,680
OK.

2458
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:00,680
All right, I'm safe to go on it for this section, which is fine.

2459
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,680
That sarcophagus is making some...

2460
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,680
You're scaring me!

2461
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:14,680
I like how it pings off onto some of the items to break them for you.

2462
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,680
Oh god, I'm so bad at this one.

2463
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:19,680
Double jump!

2464
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:27,680
OK, we need to wait.

2465
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:30,680
Spiral is also fun.

2466
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:33,680
Yeah, Spiral and Crash Bandicoot can I get...

2467
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,680
Are they by like the same developers,

2468
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:38,680
or was it just they happened to come out

2469
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:42,680
kind of close to the same time?

2470
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,680
What did I do wrong here again?

2471
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:48,680
I had nothing to protect me.

2472
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:53,680
I'm wondering if I have more time if I do that.

2473
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:54,680
Oh, wow, I do.

2474
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:55,680
Right.

2475
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,680
And let me guess, that doesn't explode the T.

2476
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:00,680
Oh, no, it does.

2477
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:02,680
I was gonna be like,

2478
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,680
oh, let me guess, it doesn't do anything.

2479
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:11,680
Again?

2480
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:13,680
Oh, no.

2481
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:17,680
Oh, we're struggling with this one.

2482
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:22,680
Goodness gravy.

2483
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:25,680
Am I making this look easy?

2484
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,680
No, sorry, am I making this look hard?

2485
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:32,680
Right, and then wait for it to come back,

2486
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,680
and then jump on it,

2487
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,680
and then defeat the mummy twice.

2488
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:40,680
Or the sarcophagi, jeez.

2489
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:46,680
Let's try this again.

2490
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:48,680
Right, and then I can just double jump here

2491
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:50,680
because I'm out of range.

2492
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:53,680
And then he's gonna drop that, which explodes that one first.

2493
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,680
Just fine with me.

2494
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,680
Right, don't send it.

2495
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,680
Don't send it, Reflings.

2496
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:06,680
If you ever replay this game, don't send it at that section

2497
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:08,680
because that's what I thought I had to do there,

2498
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,680
and it did not pay off.

2499
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:13,680
I need to wait until he spawns the second block.

2500
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,680
We'll get there.

2501
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:16,680
It just takes me a few moments.

2502
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,680
Can't believe it, they made me flat.

2503
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:21,680
Lollipop model confirmed for Strony.

2504
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:26,680
Right, again, just jump over this, which is fine.

2505
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,680
Oh, there's not even TNT this time.

2506
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:30,680
The game said, yeah, you're struggling.

2507
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,680
Right, send it, send it, send it, send it.

2508
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,680
I knew it would work if I sent it.

2509
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:36,680
Oh, I've got a checkpoint, goodness.

2510
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:40,680
That'll be very welcomed, I assure you.

2511
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:44,680
There's really enemies behind this.

2512
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:46,680
Yeah, there's freaking TNT.

2513
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:50,680
Oh.

2514
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:53,680
Take your time.

2515
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,680
Take your time.

2516
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,680
Take your time.

2517
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:03,680
That will be a mummy.

2518
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,680
Okay, we're good, we're good, we're doing it, we're doing it.

2519
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:10,680
We are doing it, oh.

2520
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,680
Why would they randomly have a natural, they are.

2521
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:15,680
They are.

2522
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:17,680
Oh.

2523
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:20,680
Oh, send it, send it, send it, send it.

2524
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:24,680
I like how he just looks at me, as if I'm not about to coblame him.

2525
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:31,680
Uh, this seems suspiciously easy.

2526
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:38,680
Rather, this is, this is, this is suspiciously.

2527
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:41,680
Ooh, wait, hold on.

2528
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:44,680
Two crystals, let's go on the bonus map.

2529
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:49,680
Don't send it, no idea.

2530
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:54,680
I'm literally giving you the strikes alive, because I'm struggling.

2531
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,680
Okay, there's lots of TNT.

2532
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,680
I'll just let it pop and then run away again.

2533
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:06,680
Whoa, oh, there's too many.

2534
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:10,680
Oh, dear.

2535
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:17,680
There's lots of fricking.

2536
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:26,680
Oh well, that's the best I can do.

2537
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,680
The best I can do is what I got.

2538
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:32,680
Cocodes, don't look at the explosion, because she's so cool.

2539
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:36,680
I start off a guy.

2540
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:42,680
Oh, that was a bit rude of me, but I did the job.

2541
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,680
Oh, there's like monkeys in these pots.

2542
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:50,680
Sling your shit elsewhere.

2543
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:04,680
Oh my god, he's quaking, his little ankles are gone, he's quaking in his boots.

2544
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:09,680
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

2545
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:12,680
Oh god, another life, thank you.

2546
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:17,680
Okay, ugh, perish, perish.

2547
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:21,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2548
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,680
Start quaking more, boom.

2549
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:30,680
I don't know what that does, I think you're supposed to like go back when you do that, but I don't go back.

2550
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:35,680
There's a message in the discord, I need to be worried.

2551
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,680
Okay.

2552
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:47,680
17.

2553
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:51,680
Bye bye blimp, I'm in the sky.

2554
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,680
Oh my god, we're playing Crimson Skies.

2555
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:56,680
Good game, good game, bye bye blimp.

2556
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:59,680
If you ever played Crimson Skies in an old old game.

2557
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:03,680
Shoot down the blimps, I have 100% health, okay.

2558
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:05,680
Oh, how do I shoot?

2559
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:07,680
Okay, machine gun.

2560
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:09,680
A to do a barrel roll.

2561
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:14,680
Wait, I'm already down 10% health?

2562
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:17,680
The heck, I only just got started.

2563
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,680
Oh, man.

2564
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:24,680
I'm going, wait that didn't break it.

2565
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:30,680
I'm barrel rolling, oh that gives me health.

2566
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:36,680
Oh my god, I like this game mode, this is so creative, I like it.

2567
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:39,680
Wow, we're getting absolutely obliterated, not gonna lie.

2568
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:44,680
We're about to get survivor's bias going on here.

2569
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:50,680
Okay, wow, I like that, that was nice and simple.

2570
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:52,680
More missions like this please.

2571
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:55,680
Wait, not all of us have a high IQ.

2572
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:58,680
You're supposed to destroy every box,

2573
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:01,680
the green boxes at the end get rid of the natures.

2574
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:05,680
Oh my god, that was such a quick and easy one, I like that.

2575
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:07,680
Give me more of that, give me more of that.

2576
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:10,680
Give me more, give me more, tell no tales.

2577
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:13,680
Oh, dead men tell no tales.

2578
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:17,680
Oh, someone said do a watch along of...

2579
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:34,680
Well, I made a few more vacations to my mechanics since our last encounter.

2580
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:38,680
So back on, or be deleted.

2581
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,680
Or be deleted.

2582
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:52,680
Oh my god, yeah.

2583
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,680
Okay, we did it, we did the ramp.

2584
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:57,680
I was like, oh, I missed the timing on the ramp.

2585
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:59,680
We still did it.

2586
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,680
Right, we're safe, we're safe.

2587
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:09,680
Man, this freaking game is just like so unapologetically good.

2588
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:13,680
Yeah, suck at the racing ones, but that's fine.

2589
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:15,680
Sorry, Mr. Seagull, you...

2590
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:19,680
I got picked to death?

2591
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,680
Oh my gosh.

2592
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:28,680
Anyway, as I was saying before I got picked to death by a freaking seagull,

2593
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:32,680
this game is like so unapologetically good,

2594
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:38,680
like it's such a chaotic, fun experience, it's so good.

2595
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:41,680
I didn't know the seagulls could hurt me like that.

2596
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:46,680
I mean, is he even there? He's not even here this time.

2597
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:50,680
So he didn't really care that much about the boxes, did he?

2598
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:54,680
That was just like the music.

2599
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:56,680
It's so... whoa.

2600
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:59,680
That one, that's rude, don't do that again.

2601
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:01,680
You upset me.

2602
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:06,680
That is just like such a freaking good game experience, honestly.

2603
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:09,680
Am I gonna land on that bomb? No.

2604
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:13,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2605
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:19,680
I probably went like the longest way.

2606
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:22,680
I don't know if I had to do that, but that was like the longest way.

2607
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:24,680
You're a cuttlefish after all.

2608
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:31,680
I'll... I'll cuttle your fish in a minute if you don't...

2609
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:32,680
I don't know.

2610
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:34,680
Please leave me alone, Mr. Shark.

2611
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:37,680
I think I'll just do this checkpoint.

2612
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:40,680
Yeah, let's do the checkpoint because I don't trust this.

2613
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:44,680
This is... they're starting to really fill it out with enemies, though.

2614
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:47,680
It was like bear the first time you played this map.

2615
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:51,680
The bombs are moving, there's like enemies everywhere.

2616
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:55,680
I mean, I know games are supposed to...

2617
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:59,680
Please leave me alone, Mr. Seagull.

2618
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:03,680
Nope, nope, that bomb is teasing.

2619
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:07,680
That bomb is teasing and teasing me.

2620
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,680
Right, let's get out of here.

2621
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:12,680
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

2622
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:16,680
But this is like a perfect remaster.

2623
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:17,680
Oh, there it is.

2624
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:20,680
That's what we need.

2625
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:21,680
Oh, I don't want to do...

2626
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:22,680
I don't have a checkpoint!

2627
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:23,680
I don't have a checkpoint!

2628
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:24,680
Give me checkpoint!

2629
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:27,680
Give me give me checkpoint, give me checkpoint, give me yeah.

2630
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:36,680
Oh my God, I just like cheese that corner there.

2631
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:38,680
Okay, we're getting there.

2632
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:40,680
We're like... we're doing it.

2633
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,680
Can I do it first time, though?

2634
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:47,680
Oh, I'm getting nervous.

2635
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:50,680
Oh, I don't know why I did that, but we'll do it.

2636
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:52,680
Oh my God.

2637
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:54,680
So good.

2638
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:01,680
I'm so surprised how much I'm enjoying this.

2639
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:04,680
But then at the same time, I'll always enjoy kids' games.

2640
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:07,680
Like literally, Viva Faniata could like blast about for ages.

2641
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:09,680
Okay, we just did that one.

2642
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:13,680
We're doing 19, which is future frenzy.

2643
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:16,680
Ooh, we're going to the city of Caloon.

2644
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:19,680
Although they wrecked it.

2645
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,680
Wow, there's laser beam timing.

2646
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:25,680
I miss Viva Faniata.

2647
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:29,680
Bro, everyone is waiting for Viva Faniata 3 to be announced.

2648
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:34,680
Unfortunately, I didn't like Viva Faniata about trouble and paradise as much.

2649
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:35,680
Which is a shame.

2650
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:37,680
Oh my God, this is so cool.

2651
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:39,680
I like all of this.

2652
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:41,680
I'm loving it.

2653
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:42,680
Every day.

2654
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,680
I'm loving it.

2655
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,680
I'm loving it.

2656
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:45,680
Can I destroy that?

2657
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:47,680
Okay, I can destroy it when it's like that.

2658
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:48,680
Yeah.

2659
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:53,680
There's like so much...

2660
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:56,680
Wumper fruit.

2661
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:01,680
Oh my God, that nature just jumped and it scared me.

2662
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:05,680
Right, I can butt bounce this.

2663
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:10,680
Wait, we're already done?

2664
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:11,680
No, this can't be right.

2665
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:13,680
It's going to take me to a new section because there's no way.

2666
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:16,680
Yeah, I was going to say there's no way this thing is done.

2667
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:18,680
Viva Faniata beats.

2668
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:25,680
Yes, in July I am going to start hammering out gamer score.

2669
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:29,680
Why is there a reflective stream?

2670
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:30,680
Why?

2671
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:34,680
She slides so well.

2672
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:38,680
I don't like you.

2673
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:40,680
I'll jump on your head though.

2674
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:46,680
I'll take you.

2675
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,680
Double jump.

2676
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:49,680
Okay, double jump.

2677
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:50,680
Double jump.

2678
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:51,680
We're learning.

2679
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:52,680
Woo!

2680
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:00,680
Okay, just jump over it again.

2681
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:01,680
Okay, we're learning.

2682
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:02,680
We're learning.

2683
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:03,680
We're observing.

2684
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:07,680
We're using our brain mass against her wills.

2685
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:09,680
Hold on, I can double jump over this.

2686
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:13,680
Oh, okay.

2687
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:16,680
And then we'll butt bounce that.

2688
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:17,680
No, we won't.

2689
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:18,680
We'll double jump over this.

2690
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:19,680
Oh, I almost messed it up.

2691
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:23,680
Oh my God, the first checkpoint was so long into this.

2692
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:27,680
On the flyer and sorcerer guys, I hate them too.

2693
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,680
People are waiting for reviews to be announced.

2694
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:33,680
And I agree.

2695
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:39,680
I would want some sort of remaster or get the same dev team in because they're so precious.

2696
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:41,680
Go away.

2697
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:42,680
Oh, sugar.

2698
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:44,680
Let's try that again.

2699
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:45,680
Go away.

2700
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:47,680
Wow!

2701
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:48,680
What?

2702
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:52,680
Yeah, that's exactly what I thought was going to happen.

2703
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:54,680
And I was forced to do that.

2704
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:55,680
Think again.

2705
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:57,680
That guy's red.

2706
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:00,680
Go green.

2707
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:04,680
Go away.

2708
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:08,680
Oh!

2709
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:12,680
Oh, I just missed it.

2710
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,680
Oh, I'm to fly.

2711
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:17,680
Oh!

2712
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:18,680
All right.

2713
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:19,680
Oh, sorry.

2714
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:20,680
I thought that was going to explode.

2715
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:21,680
Right.

2716
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:22,680
We'll do the bonus level.

2717
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:24,680
I thought that was going to explode the moment I came near it.

2718
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:25,680
Okay.

2719
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:26,680
We're safe.

2720
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:27,680
Oh, no.

2721
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:31,680
The game's telling me to like double triple quadruple jumps and stuff.

2722
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:32,680
Wait.

2723
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:34,680
Well, double jump and then.

2724
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:35,680
Okay.

2725
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:36,680
We're fine.

2726
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:37,680
We're fine.

2727
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,680
Kind of.

2728
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:44,680
Okay.

2729
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:46,680
And we got an extra life.

2730
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:47,680
Double jump.

2731
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:50,680
Right.

2732
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:53,680
We're not doing bonus levels anymore if there's a chance that I can perish in them.

2733
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:56,680
I will not stand for such slander.

2734
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:58,680
Thank you, Virginia, for the five gives to the members.

2735
02:04:58,680 --> 02:04:59,680
Shit.

2736
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:00,680
And congratulations.

2737
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:01,680
We caught it.

2738
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,680
Enjoy the emotes.

2739
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:05,680
I have four 10 emotes up.

2740
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:06,680
Wait.

2741
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:09,680
Just cross.

2742
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:13,680
I have 10 emotes.

2743
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:19,680
The girls are getting their batch attend before me because the emotes artist is going to take

2744
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:20,680
a month to do them.

2745
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:25,680
And I'm crying internally when she told me that because, ouch, why a month?

2746
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:26,680
It hurts.

2747
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:28,680
And they increased the price as well.

2748
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:29,680
It sucks even more.

2749
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:32,680
Because I like when emotes all look the same.

2750
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:33,680
Like where it's clearly.

2751
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:35,680
What the heck am I supposed to do?

2752
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:36,680
Ah!

2753
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:37,680
Wait.

2754
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:41,680
Was I not meant to spam X?

2755
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:45,680
You're a capture.

2756
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:46,680
Oh, okay.

2757
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:47,680
Oh, no.

2758
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:53,680
You don't lose lives in bonus levels, though?

2759
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:54,680
No.

2760
02:05:56,680 --> 02:05:58,680
So what am I supposed to do?

2761
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:01,680
Yeah, that's exactly what I just tried to do.

2762
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:02,680
But it didn't like it.

2763
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:03,680
Oh, sorry.

2764
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:04,680
I'm like hanging all these away.

2765
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:06,680
So go up and then.

2766
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:07,680
Coco.

2767
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:08,680
Coco.

2768
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:09,680
Coco Chanel.

2769
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:10,680
I'm going to start.

2770
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:13,680
I need to work with your manager because what's going on here?

2771
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:14,680
Coco.

2772
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:15,680
Double jump.

2773
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:16,680
And then X, X, X.

2774
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:17,680
And then that's exactly what.

2775
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:18,680
Ah!

2776
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:23,680
Of course there's a TNT there just to ruin my day.

2777
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:24,680
Right.

2778
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:27,680
We're not going to double jump.

2779
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:28,680
Ah!

2780
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,680
Coco.

2781
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:30,680
Coco.

2782
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:32,680
Coco Chanel.

2783
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:38,680
Number five is the top leading women's perfume in sales.

2784
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:41,680
It's just a fun fact.

2785
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:43,680
I think it is anyway.

2786
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:46,680
Right, go away.

2787
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:47,680
Double jump.

2788
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:52,680
I don't know why this is getting so hard.

2789
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:53,680
Right.

2790
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:57,680
Right.

2791
02:06:57,680 --> 02:06:58,680
So you do it that way.

2792
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:00,680
So go and do it that way then.

2793
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:01,680
Coco!

2794
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:02,680
Oh my God.

2795
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:04,680
Why are you not doing it that way?

2796
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:07,680
Why are you not doing it that way?

2797
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:11,680
Why are you not doing it that way?

2798
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:12,680
You did it the other way.

2799
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:15,680
So why won't you do it that way?

2800
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:21,680
Right.

2801
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:23,680
Double jump.

2802
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:24,680
Oh sorry.

2803
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:27,680
I'm like throwing all these apples away.

2804
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:28,680
Right.

2805
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:29,680
Not apples.

2806
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:30,680
So fly and then X.

2807
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,680
No.

2808
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:32,680
Right.

2809
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:33,680
That didn't work.

2810
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:34,680
So fly up and then.

2811
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:35,680
No.

2812
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,680
Why?

2813
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:37,680
Sorry.

2814
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:38,680
I need to practice doing it this way.

2815
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:42,680
But it's actually not doing it that way.

2816
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:43,680
It's not.

2817
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:49,680
Right.

2818
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:50,680
I'm just going to spam A and X.

2819
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:51,680
Oh, it worked.

2820
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:52,680
It worked.

2821
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:54,680
I literally just spammed A and X.

2822
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:55,680
I'm so smart.

2823
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:58,680
I don't know what the input controls are supposed to be.

2824
02:07:58,680 --> 02:07:59,680
Ah!

2825
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:04,680
You know what?

2826
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:05,680
You know what?

2827
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:06,680
See this game?

2828
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:08,680
I have to go do that section all over again.

2829
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:11,680
Because they put a freaking spike over that jump.

2830
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:12,680
Oh!

2831
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:15,680
And I've just lost my wheat oogabogamask.

2832
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:16,680
Bruv.

2833
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:18,680
Bruv.

2834
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:20,680
I'm getting ruled.

2835
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:22,680
I'll blame it.

2836
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:23,680
I'll blame it.

2837
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:25,680
My room is actually getting pretty warm right now.

2838
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:26,680
Right.

2839
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:27,680
Just spam A and X.

2840
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:28,680
Okay.

2841
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:30,680
We'll try again.

2842
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:31,680
We'll try again.

2843
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:32,680
We'll try again.

2844
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:33,680
Wait.

2845
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:36,680
Does the game know I'm struggling so it gives me a free mask?

2846
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:39,680
I was like, oh, again with the tea.

2847
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:40,680
The Nitro.

2848
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:41,680
My goodness.

2849
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:44,680
Alright, hold on.

2850
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:49,680
I don't...

2851
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:54,680
I'm trying to observe what I'm doing wrong.

2852
02:08:57,680 --> 02:08:58,680
No.

2853
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:00,680
Is that it?

2854
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:02,680
No!

2855
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:03,680
Okay.

2856
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:05,680
Okay.

2857
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:07,680
I know not to go now.

2858
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:08,680
Right.

2859
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:09,680
Spikes.

2860
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:11,680
And jump on his doodle hair.

2861
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,680
And then jump on that.

2862
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:14,680
And then destroy everything and we did it.

2863
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:15,680
Okay.

2864
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:16,680
Jeez.

2865
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:17,680
That was terrible.

2866
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,680
That was a rough one.

2867
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:19,680
That was a rough one.

2868
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:23,680
The game giving me a free mask because I'm so bad.

2869
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:24,680
You get the petty mask?

2870
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:25,680
No.

2871
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:27,680
That's terrible.

2872
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:28,680
But I got the crystal.

2873
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:29,680
That's the main thing.

2874
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:31,680
18.

2875
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:33,680
I did that one.

2876
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:34,680
19.

2877
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:35,680
I just did.

2878
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:36,680
So, 20.

2879
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:39,680
Oh my god, we're getting there.

2880
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:40,680
Tomb wader.

2881
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:42,680
More like, womb raider.

2882
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:43,680
Am I right?

2883
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:49,680
Thank you.

2884
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:52,680
How many lives lost now?

2885
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:53,680
Far too many.

2886
02:09:55,680 --> 02:09:57,680
Oh, there's scarabs.

2887
02:09:58,680 --> 02:09:59,680
Whoa, what are you?

2888
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:02,680
Oh.

2889
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:03,680
Oh.

2890
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:05,680
Okay.

2891
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:06,680
There's water.

2892
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:08,680
I guess I drowned in this game.

2893
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:10,680
Right.

2894
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:11,680
I guess I can't.

2895
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:12,680
What are you?

2896
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:15,680
No.

2897
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,680
You're freaky.

2898
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,680
Okay.

2899
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:19,680
That actually worked.

2900
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:20,680
I don't know how.

2901
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:24,680
Wah, wah, wah.

2902
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:25,680
Coco can't swim.

2903
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:26,680
I'm gonna.

2904
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:27,680
Let's get another one.

2905
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:31,680
We'll stand on this box and let the water rise.

2906
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:36,680
Please keep me trying a better one.

2907
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:39,680
Oh, I don't like you.

2908
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:40,680
Oh, go away.

2909
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:43,680
Oh, what are you?

2910
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:51,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2911
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:52,680
That's what I thought.

2912
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:53,680
Right.

2913
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:55,680
If bonus levels cause me to perish,

2914
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:57,680
I'm not really that fast for them.

2915
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:01,680
Okay, hold on up.

2916
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:03,680
Coco, up before you drown.

2917
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:05,680
Oh, go, go, go.

2918
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:17,680
Oh.

2919
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:19,680
Wait, did that just go down?

2920
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,680
I did.

2921
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:22,680
Sorry, I'm trying to like,

2922
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:24,680
peek ahead around the corner of the level

2923
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:26,680
to be like, hmm, what comes up next?

2924
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:28,680
Oh my God, no.

2925
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:29,680
Not now, not now.

2926
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:32,680
Wait, you don't drown?

2927
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:33,680
Of course you don't drown.

2928
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:34,680
Cause why would you?

2929
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:36,680
But me?

2930
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:37,680
I perish.

2931
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:38,680
Oh wait, I'm gonna get this life

2932
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:39,680
cause I'm doing so bad.

2933
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:40,680
I need the lives.

2934
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:41,680
I need the lives.

2935
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:45,680
Getting bonks back and forth.

2936
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:46,680
Right, but 16 lives.

2937
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:50,680
Right.

2938
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:52,680
I'm trying to explode some contact.

2939
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:54,680
Got another bonus level?

2940
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:56,680
Oh no, that's a death level.

2941
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:05,680
Oh my God, I don't like time missions.

2942
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:07,680
They make me scared.

2943
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:09,680
But we made it.

2944
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:10,680
Oh, we got the gym.

2945
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:15,680
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2946
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:16,680
I'm so sorry.

2947
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:18,680
I would like, commentate a bit more,

2948
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,680
but I'm actually getting stressed

2949
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:20,680
out playing this game.

2950
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:21,680
Right, I need this platform.

2951
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:25,680
The timing missions are like the worst.

2952
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:29,680
Cool, cool.

2953
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:30,680
Oh, checkpoint.

2954
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:31,680
Right, that's all I needed.

2955
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:34,680
Right, what are my recent saints?

2956
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:36,680
Sorry, I'm like hardly reges at all.

2957
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:39,680
Getting bonks back and forth.

2958
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:42,680
A staring contest with a freaking game, honestly.

2959
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:45,680
I believe the science assistants are robots.

2960
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:47,680
Oh my God, we're getting secret hidden lore

2961
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:48,680
that I don't know about.

2962
02:12:48,680 --> 02:12:49,680
Whoa, what was that up there?

2963
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:50,680
I saw that.

2964
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:52,680
I don't think I didn't see that.

2965
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:53,680
Exactly.

2966
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:54,680
What did I just do?

2967
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:55,680
Whoa.

2968
02:12:58,680 --> 02:12:59,680
Is it this I just unlocked?

2969
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:02,680
I think I probably just did that, yeah.

2970
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:04,680
Ain't no way I'm jumping over those nitros.

2971
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,680
They're going to explode.

2972
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:10,680
I'm not even bothering to attack him.

2973
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:16,680
Oh, can I make it in time?

2974
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:18,680
Please don't crush me.

2975
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:19,680
Okay, I made it, I made it.

2976
02:13:19,680 --> 02:13:21,680
Oh, there's TNT ahead.

2977
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:27,680
Honestly, I thought this game was going to take eight hours,

2978
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:29,680
but it must be eight hours if you're 100%

2979
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:31,680
and like go back and do everything.

2980
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:37,680
But yeah, I think we're probably going to be redirecting

2981
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:38,680
to any of this.

2982
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:41,680
If I'm blasting through the game like this,

2983
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:44,680
it honestly would do me quite well

2984
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:47,680
because I need to go up with the girls asmr.

2985
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:51,680
Whoa, that per beetle just got absolutely annihilated.

2986
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:52,680
Bonk.

2987
02:13:56,680 --> 02:13:59,680
Yes, Mercy and AC's meme asmr.

2988
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:02,680
I'd be told I'm allowed to push,

2989
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:04,680
I'm allowed to publish, so hopefully they do quite well.

2990
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:05,680
Right.

2991
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:09,680
Oh, let's go, Coco, you're doing amazing.

2992
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:12,680
Right, we are going against Doctor...

2993
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:14,680
Oh, engine.

2994
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:16,680
Oh, I get it, I get it.

2995
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:20,680
Let's hope I don't perish.

2996
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:25,680
So, you want to go with your rhymes?

2997
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:30,680
When this is over, we'll see who is obsolete.

2998
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:33,680
Wah, my Tommy.

2999
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:34,680
My Tommy.

3000
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:39,680
Eh?

3001
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:41,680
Eh?

3002
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:43,680
Ooh!

3003
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:45,680
What am I to do?

3004
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:49,680
I don't know what I'm to do, my shirt is willy.

3005
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:52,680
Oh, my God.

3006
02:14:53,680 --> 02:14:55,680
I'm just spraying, I'm just spraying,

3007
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:57,680
staying out of the way, holy crap.

3008
02:14:57,680 --> 02:15:00,680
The rockets are fricking locking onto me!

3009
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:04,680
Why is he shooting from his winky, though?

3010
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:06,680
I've not been funny.

3011
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:10,680
I don't know what I'm supposed to shoot at,

3012
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:13,680
and then I'm getting shot at really badly.

3013
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:17,680
Eh?

3014
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:20,680
No, nothing's happening to his health.

3015
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:25,680
Maybe something's gonna happen after this attack sequence?

3016
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:30,680
Oh, his winky single.

3017
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:31,680
Oh, okay, I did it.

3018
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:33,680
I destroyed his winky.

3019
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:36,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you're hurting me, you're hurting me.

3020
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:39,680
Okay, this one next.

3021
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:42,680
Okay, okay, I see it's coming together, it's coming together.

3022
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:44,680
I just need you to aim a bit better.

3023
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:46,680
Am I to aim at his guns?

3024
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:48,680
No, this cannot be right.

3025
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:51,680
Although it kind of looks like I'm supposed to aim at his guns,

3026
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:53,680
you know that.

3027
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:56,680
Oh, but how am I supposed to do that without getting aimed at?

3028
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:00,680
Oh, I'm not sure about that.

3029
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:02,680
This?

3030
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:06,680
Oh, it is, it is, this is guns, it's yellow, shoot the yellow.

3031
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:09,680
Oh, my God, the yellow paint before yellow paint was a thing.

3032
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:12,680
Oh, my God, Crash Bandicoot, you were before your time.

3033
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:15,680
You were truly before your time.

3034
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:18,680
Oh, I hardly got any licks in on that one.

3035
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:29,680
I don't want to get in that way, but...

3036
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:33,680
Okay, they're both sparking, so we're doing good.

3037
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:36,680
I'll let him get as we spray out.

3038
02:16:37,680 --> 02:16:40,680
I'll go up so he can't get at me.

3039
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:46,680
Oh, wow, his thing is really strong.

3040
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:52,680
I can't really spray into him.

3041
02:16:52,680 --> 02:16:55,680
Okay, there we go, there we go, there we go, one more.

3042
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:57,680
Oh, my God, we did it!

3043
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:01,680
Oh, my God, we did it, we're so freaking good at this game.

3044
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:05,680
Oh.

3045
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:07,680
Uh...

3046
02:17:07,680 --> 02:17:09,680
Uh...

3047
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:14,680
Pura! Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura, Pura!

3048
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:19,680
Pura's gonna help me!

3049
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:23,680
We love Pura!

3050
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:30,680
Okay, I'm literally just doing 360s to try and avoid any enemies and just do, like, tag damage.

3051
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:37,680
Oh, my God, Pura is helping me so much.

3052
02:17:40,680 --> 02:17:45,680
Wait, that thing is getting closer to me, whatever that is, oh, it went behind me.

3053
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:48,680
Uh, what the heck?

3054
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:51,680
I don't know what's going on with that.

3055
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:53,680
What?

3056
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:58,680
Oh, Poodle, you're helping me so much, darling.

3057
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:00,680
Poodle love.

3058
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:02,680
We love Poodle out here.

3059
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:06,680
Oh my god, yes!

3060
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:09,680
We did it!

3061
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:18,680
To fire fruit at a target, hold left mouse button to raise a gun and then aim with the direction and press B.

3062
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:22,680
Wait, I actually do unlock a crossbow in Crash Bandicoot?

3063
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:25,680
No way, that's so good.

3064
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:30,680
I got nervous when I saw a face too, not gonna lie, I was like, eww, my confidence is making.

3065
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:38,680
Uh huh.

3066
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:45,680
Oh my aching head.

3067
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:48,680
I'm not feeling myself these days.

3068
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:51,680
So the end is in sight.

3069
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:56,680
Gather another five crystals and again you will foil my plan.

3070
02:18:56,680 --> 02:18:58,680
Or will you?

3071
02:18:58,680 --> 02:19:00,680
He's got veneers.

3072
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:08,680
Right, no, we're, wait, so we're falling for his trap if we keep progressing.

3073
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:10,680
Wait, I've got my laptop and my laptop.

3074
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:12,680
I have two laptops.

3075
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:15,680
You're such an MLG gamer, Coco.

3076
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:17,680
We're doing it!

3077
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:20,680
Gone tomorrow.

3078
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:23,680
News today, gone tomorrow.

3079
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:24,680
That's the saying.

3080
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:27,680
Are all the levels after a saying or like a pun?

3081
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:29,680
Honestly, me.

3082
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:32,680
Cortex is depressed for a throw.

3083
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:33,680
What's going on here?

3084
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:35,680
Double jump.

3085
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:37,680
Double jump.

3086
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:39,680
Double jump.

3087
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:44,680
Oh, I don't like that.

3088
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:47,680
Wait, double jump.

3089
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:49,680
I guess you do even like.

3090
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:51,680
Oh, I don't like that.

3091
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,680
That's awfully menacing.

3092
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:55,680
What do you do?

3093
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:04,680
Oh wait, what was this?

3094
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:05,680
I can unlock now.

3095
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:07,680
I think I can throw food.

3096
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:10,680
Oh, Coco!

3097
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:14,680
Coco!

3098
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:17,680
What on earth is that?

3099
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:23,680
Coco, that's offensively large and hilarious.

3100
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,680
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

3101
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:27,680
Sorry, I like jumped right into that.

3102
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:30,680
Coco, that's not even a gun.

3103
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:32,680
That's a rocket launcher.

3104
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:35,680
Oh my gosh.

3105
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:38,680
Wait, does this make the game like way easier though?

3106
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:40,680
It does!

3107
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:42,680
Oh my god, do you see that aim ball?

3108
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:44,680
I could...

3109
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:48,680
I will safely get past.

3110
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:52,680
Bro, Coco, that was so violent.

3111
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:56,680
Honestly, she's done asking nicely.

3112
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:57,680
She's had enough.

3113
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:00,680
She's like, bro, get me out of this game.

3114
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:05,680
What, do this?

3115
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,680
Oh no, I broke the box.

3116
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:13,680
Oh my god, I didn't know you had a rocket launcher in Crash Bandicoot.

3117
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:16,680
I definitely did not get this far into the game.

3118
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:21,680
There's a child, there's a wean, there's a speckle, honestly.

3119
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:25,680
I was probably a molecule when I was playing this.

3120
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:28,680
I'm just the best in Bandicoot with a rocket launcher.

3121
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:33,680
I thought of that meme, but there's like, nah, there's no way I can bring it up.

3122
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:35,680
I'll have to let everyone bring it up.

3123
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:37,680
Hold on, nah.

3124
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:40,680
I can like aim to the sides like this.

3125
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:43,680
Thank you, Lord of Strongs for the five gifted membership.

3126
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:46,680
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

3127
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:49,680
You'll have to enable membership gifting.

3128
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:51,680
You might get a prompt in chat if you don't have it enabled,

3129
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:54,680
but congrats to those, you can use my emotes now.

3130
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:57,680
Wait, oh my god.

3131
02:21:57,680 --> 02:21:59,680
I'm getting you.

3132
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:03,680
Oh, it's out of bounds off, can't wait one.

3133
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:10,680
Oh my god, I can destroy TNT from afar as well.

3134
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:14,680
I don't know why I went up, I could have been blue.

3135
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:22,680
Oh my god, this makes the game so easy.

3136
02:22:22,680 --> 02:22:24,680
I love it here.

3137
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:27,680
I love fresh Bandicoot.

3138
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:33,680
Or Coco can't Bandicoot because Coco Pog.

3139
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:35,680
Wow, I almost got done.

3140
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:39,680
Congrats on those who caught the member.

3141
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:41,680
Wow, see it worked that time,

3142
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:46,680
but every other time I try to do the fluffy effect and fly, it never works.

3143
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:49,680
She didn't manage to do another two games.

3144
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:52,680
I have never actually played the other two games,

3145
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:56,680
so I don't know what the experience is like.

3146
02:22:56,680 --> 02:23:00,680
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to get rid of all those asses.

3147
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:02,680
Oh my god, the game is so kind.

3148
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:05,680
It doesn't even go against your ammo.

3149
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:08,680
Can I shoot you now?

3150
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:09,680
No.

3151
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:11,680
Okay, I have to do the dodge.

3152
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:21,680
I'm freaking loving this game.

3153
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:24,680
Oh my gosh, it's so well put together.

3154
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:26,680
Other than the race in one's bus,

3155
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:28,680
because I'm dumb and can't figure it out.

3156
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:31,680
Ale vivas.

3157
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:33,680
Ale vivas.

3158
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,680
Thank you for coming on Membo.

3159
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:37,680
And Lord of the Drums again.

3160
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:39,680
For the gifted membership.

3161
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:43,680
Me and the Reeflings.

3162
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:48,680
Just as I was complaining about a race in the mission.

3163
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:51,680
Ah.

3164
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:55,680
It's the last one though.

3165
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:58,680
It's the last race in mission.

3166
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:03,680
Surely.

3167
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:04,680
Surely.

3168
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:06,680
Two and then go.

3169
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:10,680
Right, I got the boost.

3170
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:13,680
The police are doing nothing.

3171
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:15,680
Oh, I never even saw that.

3172
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:19,680
Oh my god, I need my glasses on so badly.

3173
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:26,680
Would you still love me as a streamer if I never put my...

3174
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:28,680
I'm trying to hold it together.

3175
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:31,680
I'm trying to hold it together.

3176
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:35,680
I'm at the absurdity that is these maps.

3177
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:36,680
For racing.

3178
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:38,680
I'm literally seventh place.

3179
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:43,680
There's no way.

3180
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:45,680
There's no way I've got this.

3181
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:46,680
I refuse.

3182
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:50,680
Yeah, get in my way.

3183
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:53,680
Okay, everyone's using the ramp which is fine.

3184
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:54,680
I'll use it too.

3185
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:57,680
Okay, you're going to have to use the ramp.

3186
02:24:57,680 --> 02:24:59,680
Because of the...

3187
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:00,680
Bro.

3188
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:02,680
These AI police cars!

3189
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:07,680
Bro, you can't even reverse in this game.

3190
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:12,680
Reeflings, I'm going to have to send my game file to one of you right now.

3191
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:16,680
And then you send me it back complete and I'll go do the other missions while I'm at it.

3192
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:20,680
Because this is ridiculous.

3193
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:26,680
Why did they make the freaking driving one so hard?

3194
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:33,680
And Crash, if you didn't stop skating everywhere across the map, we're actually going to have issues.

3195
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:35,680
Out my road.

3196
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:36,680
Okay, well that was terrible.

3197
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:38,680
Please don't ever do that again.

3198
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:40,680
I'm fifth place.

3199
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:44,680
Oh, and I missed it!

3200
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:47,680
Okay, the AI can actually go off road which is interesting.

3201
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:49,680
I didn't know that.

3202
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:53,680
The AI is adapting and I'm getting nervous.

3203
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:55,680
Why are they...

3204
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:58,680
Oh, and I missed it again.

3205
02:25:58,680 --> 02:26:00,680
I'm fourth place.

3206
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:02,680
Honestly, that wasn't awful.

3207
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:03,680
I'm wondering...

3208
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:04,680
Right, we'll keep doing it.

3209
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:05,680
We'll keep doing it.

3210
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:06,680
We'll keep doing it.

3211
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:09,680
That was the first time I played the map and the first thing I did was fall off it, okay?

3212
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:15,680
Refillings are always thrilled to Princess Carrie and Momé, honestly.

3213
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:16,680
I just wish...

3214
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:17,680
I just...

3215
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:18,680
I just...

3216
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:20,680
I'm getting filtered by a child, okay?

3217
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:23,680
Three, two, and then hold, boost.

3218
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:28,680
Okay, and then on the left side there is already an issue.

3219
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:35,680
So the AI is actually choosing to go off the map, which is curious.

3220
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:39,680
I didn't think the AI did such a thing.

3221
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:42,680
Very curious indeed.

3222
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:47,680
Yeah, they're all avoiding the pull-offs.

3223
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,680
So just take it easy.

3224
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:51,680
These corners didn't do so...

3225
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:54,680
Yeah, I didn't do so hot in these corners.

3226
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:56,680
Wah!

3227
02:26:56,680 --> 02:26:59,680
I'll take that boost though.

3228
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:00,680
I'll take that boost.

3229
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:02,680
Thank you.

3230
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:05,680
I have to take this ramp because there is a gap.

3231
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:06,680
You will not make it.

3232
02:27:06,680 --> 02:27:07,680
Go Minasori.

3233
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:10,680
You will not make it if you take that gap.

3234
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:12,680
It's okay.

3235
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:13,680
No!

3236
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:14,680
Fenderbender!

3237
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:16,680
Fenderbender!

3238
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:18,680
That's illegal.

3239
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:20,680
You have to stop and call the police!

3240
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:25,680
Aw, fuck this.

3241
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:27,680
Okay, hold on.

3242
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:28,680
Can you Fenderbender?

3243
02:27:28,680 --> 02:27:30,680
Elsewhere, please!

3244
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:31,680
Elsewhere.

3245
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:33,680
Okay.

3246
02:27:44,680 --> 02:27:45,680
I'm trying.

3247
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:47,680
I'm actually trying so hard right now.

3248
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:50,680
I'm sweating my cheeks off.

3249
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:53,680
I'm sweating my panties off, but you all know what's happening with that.

3250
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:55,680
Oh, I might do it!

3251
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:57,680
Oh my god, I might do it.

3252
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:59,680
Oh my god, just don't...

3253
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:01,680
No!

3254
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:09,680
My mouth is a gap from how hard I'm trying right now.

3255
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:10,680
Oh!

3256
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:12,680
Oh my god, I did it in two!

3257
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:14,680
Oh!

3258
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:15,680
Thank god.

3259
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:16,680
Thank god.

3260
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:17,680
Oh my god.

3261
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:20,680
That was so freaking hard.

3262
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:23,680
Literally maximum mouth breathing.

3263
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:27,680
All wrinkly parts of my brain were locked in.

3264
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:31,680
All the smooth parts of my brain were told to be quiet momentarily.

3265
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:33,680
Oh my goodness, Gravy.

3266
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:37,680
Thank god I never have to do a racing mission again.

3267
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:38,680
Oh.

3268
02:28:40,680 --> 02:28:42,680
Victoire!

3269
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:43,680
Victoire.

3270
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:45,680
Oh lolol.

3271
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:48,680
Oh, such a good game.

3272
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:49,680
I'm sorry.

3273
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:50,680
I'm absolutely loving this.

3274
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:52,680
I highly recommend it, Revenge.

3275
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:57,680
If you have got some money to spare right now

3276
02:28:57,680 --> 02:28:59,680
and you want to give a game-ish...

3277
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:00,680
Hey!

3278
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:02,680
I was on top of your heat.

3279
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:06,680
I heavily recommend getting the V-Master Crash Bandicoot

3280
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:09,680
because this is just fun.

3281
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:11,680
I have to wait until the Knife Man goes away

3282
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:14,680
and then I don't come this way.

3283
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:15,680
Great.

3284
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:16,680
Flamethrower?

3285
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:17,680
I'm just fine.

3286
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:20,680
Oh, the guy's gone now.

3287
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:22,680
The game helps you if you're rubbish as well,

3288
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:24,680
which is even better.

3289
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:26,680
The game is holding my hand.

3290
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:29,680
Oh my god, I can't believe a refling made this game just for me

3291
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:32,680
because they knew how much I struggle.

3292
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:33,680
Oh my god, reflins.

3293
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:34,680
You're actually so selfless.

3294
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:36,680
It's stunning.

3295
02:29:36,680 --> 02:29:38,680
You're so polite.

3296
02:29:38,680 --> 02:29:40,680
We've got a checkpoint.

3297
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:42,680
What's going on here?

3298
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:43,680
I made it anyway.

3299
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:45,680
I don't know what's going on, but I made it anyway.

3300
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:46,680
There's a little thing to the right.

3301
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:48,680
I'm tempted to go explore,

3302
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:51,680
but we'll go explore to the right.

3303
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:52,680
What's over here?

3304
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:56,680
Don't think I didn't see that.

3305
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:59,680
I thought it was a hidden thing to the right.

3306
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:00,680
And it's not.

3307
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:03,680
You're telling me it's not a hidden area to the right?

3308
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:08,680
Bro, I'm sorry, but reflins are pranking me.

3309
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:11,680
I can't believe you got in the dev team just to prank me, bro.

3310
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:13,680
Whoa, there's TNT there.

3311
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:15,680
I want to interact with none of that.

3312
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:16,680
I want none of this.

3313
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:19,680
I want any problems.

3314
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:20,680
I don't want peace.

3315
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:24,680
I want to problem me giving myself more work is literally that mean.

3316
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:25,680
I don't want peace.

3317
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:34,680
I want problems.

3318
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:37,680
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we ain't going.

3319
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:40,680
We ain't going until you go.

3320
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:44,680
Prince Ali, mighty is he.

3321
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:48,680
Oh, blah, blah, blah.

3322
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:52,680
Show some respect for you.

3323
02:30:52,680 --> 02:30:55,680
Oh, that's not a platform.

3324
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,680
Okay.

3325
02:30:56,680 --> 02:30:58,680
Sorry, there's not a platform there.

3326
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:01,680
Oops.

3327
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:04,680
Oh, and I missed.

3328
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:07,680
I think Coco just like constantly has her laptop on her.

3329
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:08,680
She's like, yeah, I need this.

3330
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:09,680
Honestly, it's safe.

3331
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:14,680
I'm like, bro, but I need internet access to all things.

3332
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:15,680
Okay.

3333
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:16,680
Flamethrower, that's fine.

3334
02:31:16,680 --> 02:31:20,680
Do not go on the fake platform that isn't a real platform.

3335
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:21,680
Okay.

3336
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:29,680
You're going to be sorely disappointed that to find there's nothing.

3337
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:34,680
Whoa, that was actually really lucky timing.

3338
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:37,680
What's going on here?

3339
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:39,680
I think the camera angles.

3340
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:41,680
At first, I actually didn't like that.

3341
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:44,680
I couldn't control that camera angle, but now I'm like, I get it now.

3342
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:48,680
This is actually pretty, pretty nice.

3343
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:54,680
This is pretty rewarding.

3344
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:56,680
As much as we love a cheeky.

3345
02:31:56,680 --> 02:31:58,680
Oh, wow.

3346
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:03,680
How often do you throw?

3347
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:04,680
Right.

3348
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:05,680
Okay.

3349
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:12,680
I saw him peek and I was like, I'm about to get in trouble.

3350
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:13,680
Right.

3351
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:15,680
Jump and then jump again.

3352
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:16,680
Okay.

3353
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:17,680
We're getting there.

3354
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:18,680
We're getting there refunds.

3355
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:19,680
Oh my God.

3356
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:20,680
An extra life.

3357
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:21,680
Don't mind me.

3358
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:26,680
The only thing I don't miss from the era is the time control.

3359
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:28,680
Oh my God.

3360
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:32,680
We're absolutely smoking.

3361
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:35,680
We're smoking and no tobacco is needed.

3362
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:38,680
Okay.

3363
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:40,680
Wow.

3364
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:43,680
So we only got two more levels and it's a boss fight.

3365
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:45,680
Mad Bomba.

3366
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:47,680
Bombadier.

3367
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:48,680
Remember your bazooka.

3368
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:50,680
Oh, I already forgot I had one.

3369
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:52,680
Crash Coco.

3370
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:56,680
Remember, it is not only Dr. Cortex that we battle.

3371
02:32:56,680 --> 02:33:00,680
Beware of Uka Uka, my children.

3372
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:07,680
He is a far more dangerous enemy than anyone can imagine.

3373
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:09,680
Oh no.

3374
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:12,680
That's not good.

3375
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:14,680
Shoot down the Bombadier.

3376
02:33:14,680 --> 02:33:16,680
Shoot down the bombers.

3377
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:21,680
Like these planes that can shoot me.

3378
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:22,680
Oh my God.

3379
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:27,680
We're committing artillery warfare.

3380
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:34,680
Get that plane done.

3381
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:37,680
I'm going to just do this.

3382
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,680
Are you a badie?

3383
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:40,680
Yeah, you are.

3384
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:46,680
Okay, so I can shoot the enemies as they appear and then I don't get hit by them.

3385
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:48,680
Okay, that's pretty good to know.

3386
02:33:48,680 --> 02:33:52,680
Man, this one was so far away.

3387
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:54,680
Okay, there we go.

3388
02:33:54,680 --> 02:33:59,680
Destroy this guy completely wholeheartedly.

3389
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:04,680
I did see someone's one in there, but I think we're okay.

3390
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:05,680
Okay, there we go.

3391
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:06,680
I'll take the health now.

3392
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:11,680
I don't know if that was a bit too preemptive, but we're doing it.

3393
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:12,680
Oh, I see him.

3394
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:13,680
I see him.

3395
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:14,680
I see him.

3396
02:34:14,680 --> 02:34:15,680
I see him.

3397
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,680
I see him.

3398
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:21,680
He was going to become a Kazian.

3399
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:22,680
Jeez.

3400
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:26,680
Okay, we're getting there.

3401
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:28,680
We've got two more bombardiers.

3402
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:29,680
What?

3403
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:31,680
Sorry, the controls are inverted.

3404
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:36,680
Sorry, I'm used to the controls being inverted for this.

3405
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:38,680
Man, I'm absolutely smoking.

3406
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:40,680
Sorry, I'm actually so good at this child game.

3407
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:44,680
I need head pads for how good I am at destroying this child game.

3408
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:54,680
I need accolades to forever recognize me as so good at beating up this game.

3409
02:34:54,680 --> 02:34:57,680
It's fantastic.

3410
02:34:57,680 --> 02:34:58,680
We did it.

3411
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:00,680
Okay, we almost did it.

3412
02:35:00,680 --> 02:35:01,680
Wait, hold on.

3413
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:02,680
Let me turn around.

3414
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:04,680
Let me just get these guys first.

3415
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:05,680
Turn around.

3416
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:10,680
Every now and then I get to see you.

3417
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:11,680
Oh my goodness.

3418
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:13,680
Oh, I'm getting head pads.

3419
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:15,680
You're in so good moment.

3420
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:16,680
Good girl.

3421
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:20,680
I was thinking of Sly Culver too.

3422
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:22,680
You regularly get the petty mask.

3423
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:23,680
No, don't point that out.

3424
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:24,680
Don't tell them that.

3425
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:26,680
No one needs to know that.

3426
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:31,680
I don't get the petty mask that much, okay?

3427
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:34,680
Okay, I just did that.

3428
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:35,680
What's this?

3429
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:40,680
A bug light, not to be confused with a bug's life.

3430
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:42,680
Okay, you're doing great.

3431
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:43,680
Thank you, Reflink.

3432
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:45,680
This game is absolutely fantastic.

3433
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:46,680
I cannot recommend this enough.

3434
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:51,680
I may actually recommend the girls play it just because you don't really need any previous

3435
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:53,680
knowledge other than that first dinosaur.

3436
02:35:53,680 --> 02:36:07,680
I was having a stroke trying to figure out how to get the dinosaur to not coblame on me.

3437
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:11,680
I've got a little guide for the girls that has a list of the games that they can play

3438
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:17,680
based on complexity, but I actually need to make it a much better list because I need

3439
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:23,680
to add how long it takes to play or these temporary areas.

3440
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:27,680
Oh, it's Navi.

3441
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:29,680
Oh, wait.

3442
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:33,680
Oh my God, I have my own light source.

3443
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:37,680
It's beautiful.

3444
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:40,680
All right, double jump, X, and we're safe.

3445
02:36:40,680 --> 02:36:44,680
Oh, this is beautiful.

3446
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:46,680
Another light for me?

3447
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:47,680
Oh, he got tired.

3448
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:48,680
He needs to go to bed.

3449
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:49,680
That's okay.

3450
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:52,680
You don't have to do this for your entire life.

3451
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:54,680
Oh, I keep throwing my apples away.

3452
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:55,680
Oopsie.

3453
02:36:55,680 --> 02:37:01,680
Hmm, how far away did I just get put back?

3454
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:04,680
Oh, I'll get masked right next to this one point.

3455
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:07,680
Johnny's been fine, but most importantly, she's enjoying herself.

3456
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:08,680
Everyone's happy.

3457
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:09,680
Stream is bliss.

3458
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:10,680
Oh, that's so precious.

3459
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:13,680
I'm glad you guys are happy.

3460
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:19,680
Oh, I keep throwing away me one for fruit.

3461
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:20,680
Okay.

3462
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:24,680
You can now go into retirement and then I'll take you.

3463
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:26,680
And then what did I do wrong here?

3464
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:27,680
I already forgot.

3465
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:28,680
What's that?

3466
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:33,680
No, Coco, you're spinning everywhere.

3467
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:34,680
Okay.

3468
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:36,680
Jump and then double jump.

3469
02:37:36,680 --> 02:37:37,680
See?

3470
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:38,680
Nice and simple.

3471
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:43,680
Biggest enemies are literally jumping in this game.

3472
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:44,680
No other reason.

3473
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:45,680
Okay.

3474
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:46,680
Whoa.

3475
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:47,680
No, it's dark.

3476
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:48,680
Oh, hello.

3477
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:49,680
I cannot see.

3478
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:50,680
I cannot see.

3479
02:37:50,680 --> 02:37:51,680
Please do not leave me alone.

3480
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:52,680
Oh, okay.

3481
02:37:52,680 --> 02:37:53,680
Wow.

How long does this last for?

3501
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:21,680
Oh, it literally ended just as I walloped that enemy.

3502
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:23,680
Holy crap.

3503
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:24,680

I do I need to jump over it. Oh, I need to jump over their laser beam if they get in the way

3529
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:11,520
No tiki man's trying to help me out, but the baddie is all the way while you're putting yo C4

3530
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:14,320
Why are you putting C4 on the ground? Oh?

3531
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:21,160
Wait, oh, no, I was supposed to wall up him his shield was down. I'm sorry. I missed that cue

02:41:29,640 --> 02:41:34,680
Cuz I didn't really remember anything right. He throws these and they explode and

02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:47,600
Oh

3549
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:51,920
No, no, no, no, don't do that. Okay. Okay, it's fine. We're safe

3550
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:54,720

3618
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:14,680
Nepotism hire, but you know what will let it slide for this game this

3619
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:19,400
Experience the OST. I am gen 3

3620

Background music is gonna be crash bandicoot OST. I'm not even I'm not even gonna tell any lies or any scoobies

3621
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:33,040
I am blown away by this game. Obviously. I had a chance to play it in childhood

3622
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:36,560
So there was a lot of nostalgia associated with the game

3623
02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:41,680
But this have always nothing but a short of fantastic a lovely experience

3624
02:49:42,320 --> 02:49:49,280
Truly the game didn't feel feel like it was going on too long if you enjoy it. You can also a hundred percent it and

3625
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:53,160
Just ten out of ten all-round type of game

3626
02:49:53,960 --> 02:50:00,120
For me helps with a short attention span helps that was designed for kids to play helps that was beautiful

3627
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:07,360
Colorful and everything is so interactive. Do you have any plans to play the newest crash game crash board?

3628
02:50:07,360 --> 02:50:09,280
It's about time. I've never played it

3629
02:50:09,280 --> 02:50:16,360
Um, but I would understand why not if it's anything if any of the other crash games are like this that they're quick

3630
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:21,960
Wham-bam, they've got fun little interactive mini games inside like the different levels. Sure

3631
02:50:22,080 --> 02:50:25,280
I will a hundred percent play the rest of crash bandicoot

Count me in

3645
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:26,760
Yeah, crash 4 is actually pretty hard. Okay, maybe not. Maybe we'll just pause on crash 4

3646
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,320
Just for now

3647
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:31,000
Yes, go pyro would be fun

3648
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:35,320
Spyro is even easier than this. Spyro is super easy

3649
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:39,320
When's the pizza tower stream? I don't even know what that is. I

3650
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:44,520
Hope in the end of credits and it says and thank you the fans

3651
02:51:45,880 --> 02:51:48,760
I'm allowed to say a spoiler for the video game

3652
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:51,360
The vealer video game

3653
02:51:59,080 --> 02:52:03,800
Sure say the spoiler, okay, this is for only people who are watching the stream at

3654
02:52:04,240 --> 02:52:06,640
The end of the vealer video game

3655
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:14,480
You hear a voiceline from all of us and we say and thank you the player after you have just put one hand at our game

3656
02:52:15,480 --> 02:52:19,920
Because I love it so much in video games. I was like, I'm having it in this game

3657
02:52:21,080 --> 02:52:27,880
Trial wait, are these speedrunners? No trial testers one hour. Wait, why is it showing time? I

3658
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:30,520
Don't know what the times are for

3659
02:52:31,160 --> 02:52:37,560
Okay, let's go. Yeah after we finish the game literally all of us come on and we all go. Thank you the player

3660
02:52:38,760 --> 02:52:40,080
and

3661
02:52:40,080 --> 02:52:42,080
Oh, these are the devs

3662
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:45,920
Are these the speedrun times?

3663
02:52:46,720 --> 02:52:51,280
That's outrageous. Did they all know it can't be this is 12 minutes

3664
02:52:52,280 --> 02:52:57,080
No one has completed the game. Maybe speedrunners. 12 minutes would be broken the game

3665
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:03,480
The other game is designed to play one-handed. Oh, it absolutely is we can't we can hardly even talk about it

3666
02:53:03,480 --> 02:53:07,160
I'm going to get the girls to record them playing it

3667
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:13,440
And then they'll upload it to their alt-twitters so they can like play it for the first time and experience it

3668
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:23,440
It's pair map the map names were on the left my apologies. Oh my gosh ten out of ten experience

3669
02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:30,640
What a magnificent game what a well-rounded no wonder they remastered it

3670
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:35,560
So what does this do interacts swap hero save loads? That's it. We'll save

3671
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:37,440
and

3672
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:40,920
Yeah, wow just ten out of ten. Oh

3673
02:53:41,960 --> 02:53:46,200
Wait, what did I just do? Oh, did I accidentally just load over my save? Oops

3674
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:53,200
It sees. Oh, it's fine. We finished the game. Anyway, I think I'm gonna mess stuff a little bit there, but it's okay. I

3675
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:59,680
Think I undid all my progress. Oopsies. I did all my progress. That's too busy yapping

3676
02:54:02,280 --> 02:54:04,280
Don't worry though

3677
02:54:04,960 --> 02:54:06,960
We all make mistakes

3678
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:15,600
Yeah, no, that's well, there's no point in saving because I'm already saved up. Oh, well, it's fine. It's fine. That was

3679
02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:23,760
Fantastic, right. I'm gonna check if there's any veal or girlies on and I understand that this is a shorter stream

3680
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:27,640
I thought it was gonna be an eight hour stream, but I was wrong and

3681
02:54:28,320 --> 02:54:30,320
but in exchange

3682
02:54:31,160 --> 02:54:33,080
in exchange

3683
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:35,120
For a shorter stream

3684
02:54:35,800 --> 02:54:37,800
My darling grieflings

3685
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:42,040
Mercy and AC's meme ASMR is gonna be uploaded at a certain time

3686
02:54:42,040 --> 02:54:47,440
It might be timed after the stream because I think mercy asked for me to make sure it's after she finished streaming

3687
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:52,280
She's gonna end up all savings over the 30% also. No, no, no, no, no

3688
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:56,840
Emi is up in an hour. That's perfectly fine with me. Um, oh

3689
02:54:58,040 --> 02:55:00,880
Pardon me for being so rude. I just burped there. Don't mind me

3690
02:55:01,640 --> 02:55:09,720
Oh, no, I got kicked out of my YouTube account. Shit. Hold on. I need a fucking message management from my password

3691
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:14,160
Hmm

3692
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:16,880
Just need to message

3693
02:55:16,880 --> 02:55:24,120
What is my YouTube password, please? I'm locked out. I'm locked out. I don't know why I locked me out

3694
02:55:26,480 --> 02:55:29,120
Oh, do excuse me. Oh

3695
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:36,520
But I hope that's not YouTube fucking doing something okay, okay with my account better. No be

3696
02:55:37,320 --> 02:55:42,320
Right, let me go to a chat and stream Dave. Have a what it's me

3697
02:55:43,360 --> 02:55:46,480
It's me. Oh my god. It's me

3698
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:49,360
Right, I'll put some background music on

3699
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:54,240
One one. I want one. That was such an amazing team

3700
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:59,400
God, I can't go for that. Right. Emi is going to be up in T

3701
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:01,640
minus

3702
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:03,640
T minus what?

3703
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:06,520
T minus what?

3704
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:11,640
An hour. Oh my god, I have no hour to yeah, don't mind if I do

3705
02:56:12,360 --> 02:56:16,120
Oops, no, I definitely do not want to end stream from the dashboard

3706
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:22,200
Please don't give me that option. That scared me. Don't do that again YouTube. Please don't do that again. You're stressing me out

3707
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:29,320
Hey, I'm just gonna make sure I'm redirecting into any piezo because her monetization stream

3708
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:35,960
Is monetization celebrate celebration

3709
02:56:37,800 --> 02:56:39,800
Monetization celebration

3710
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:47,080
I give up. I give up. Um, Emi Emi Emi monetization celebration

3711
02:56:47,240 --> 02:56:49,240
And

3712
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:54,440
Yes, okay, it says save so when I end my stream

3713
02:56:55,160 --> 02:56:58,040
God, I can't get over how fantastic that game was

3714
02:57:01,240 --> 02:57:03,240
Uh, what's going on?

3715
02:57:08,440 --> 02:57:12,440
Why have I got so many comments on that new ASMR video? Well, I'll show you the stats again

3716
02:57:13,160 --> 02:57:21,400
I'll show you the stats on that. I don't know. Uh, hopefully I'm praying that the girls's mean videos also get as popular as mine because

3717
02:57:23,640 --> 02:57:28,760
That that got really popular for like no reason. Oh my god. I don't want to brag or anything. Hold on

3718
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:32,120
Let me let me screenshot so I can show you guys the dirty details

3719
02:57:32,840 --> 02:57:38,120
The dirty details the the oh, sorry. I just blurt flash behind myself trying to save this file save file

3720
02:57:39,080 --> 02:57:45,800
That one. Uh, actually, I can just take off the reactive model. That's probably a bit better of an idea. Don't you think?

3721
02:57:49,160 --> 02:57:51,960
Wait, so it's just a zero

3722
02:57:54,120 --> 02:57:57,560
Um, right hold on. How do I show?

3723
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:02,440
How do I show this on desktop?

3724
02:58:04,600 --> 02:58:06,600
Um

3725
02:58:07,240 --> 02:58:10,680
What did I call the file? I've already forgotten the file name

3726
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:14,120
Oh, there there

3727
02:58:14,120 --> 02:58:16,600
Okay, so this is what it said. Oh, it's there you on

3728
02:58:17,320 --> 02:58:19,320
Bit big bit big

3729
02:58:19,320 --> 02:58:21,640
This is what it says now on that video

3730
02:58:22,520 --> 02:58:29,560
So congrats. You have 34,000 views, bro. Yeah, I definitely got picked up in the algorithm because I only had 5000 subscribers

3731
02:58:30,360 --> 02:58:34,200
It says I earned 780 subscribers from it. She

3732
02:58:34,920 --> 02:58:41,080
My that video alone reached youtube's monetization watch time

3733
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:47,000
Thingings it literally says 3000 watch hours. That's how much you need to get monetized

3734
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:53,000
You need that one video alone. You need 500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours that one video alone

3735
02:58:53,800 --> 02:58:56,040
I could submit for monetization. That's insane

3736
02:58:56,840 --> 02:59:04,120
And also, of course, I'm breaking the bank at 20. Please don't be don't be surprised when the 3d models come out

3737
02:59:04,120 --> 02:59:09,480
Next week because my ASMR is raking in the money. Yes. No, no, there's no 3d

3738
02:59:10,920 --> 02:59:17,080
VTuber streams coming up just yet cost a pretty penny to get that stuff kind of dealt with

3739
02:59:19,640 --> 02:59:23,880
Yes, there will be signs. Yes, there will be signs

3740
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:26,120
um

3741
02:59:26,120 --> 02:59:30,120
But yeah, that video definitely uh is getting about

3742
02:59:35,080 --> 02:59:38,600
That was fantastic. I can't believe it

3743
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:42,760
It's not yacht soon. Absolutely not. I have no desire for a yacht

3744
02:59:43,640 --> 02:59:44,840
That is

3745
02:59:44,840 --> 02:59:49,080
I've I just never had an interest in that kind of thing at all

3746
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:54,280
Right, I want to open up marshmallow, but last time I opened it up. It had a little bit of

3747
02:59:57,720 --> 03:00:01,640
Uh, right, let me I will link my marshmallow so you're free to

3748
03:00:04,360 --> 03:00:07,640
Penis chocolate ASMR surprisingly is popular

3749
03:00:07,880 --> 03:00:11,960
Brian, it's not that it was pentas dorkin

3750
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:14,840

3751
03:00:14,840 --> 03:00:23,480
Uh, thank you. Oh marin something for the super chat. It was me asking to hold it while you tinkle

3752
03:00:24,360 --> 03:00:26,360
It's not pentas dorking

3753
03:00:27,160 --> 03:00:34,600
The next audio I upload is for now. I'm I'm I'm I'm teasing I'm breezing for a teasing

03:00:36,360 --> 03:00:39,960
Dear mommy next time you go in a tinfoil. Yeah, can I join you on stream?

3755
03:00:40,040 --> 03:00:43,320
Wait, have you have you put a little tinfoil hat on a wiefling?

3756
03:00:44,520 --> 03:00:51,800
Oh, my little wieflings have a tinfoil hat. You're so cute. Let me put it on right now. Hold on

3757
03:00:52,760 --> 03:01:00,760
Next time I go for a wee rant. This is I'm gonna put you right next to me right here on my right here

3758
03:01:02,840 --> 03:01:08,440
Oh, wait, no, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I can do I can do you a step even better than that hold

3759
03:01:09,240 --> 03:01:11,240
Hold pause pause

3760
03:01:11,480 --> 03:01:13,480
Pause don't breathe

3761
03:01:14,200 --> 03:01:16,200
Oh

3762
03:01:21,720 --> 03:01:23,720
Okay, you can breathe you can breathe again. Wow

3763
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:26,680
Wow

3764
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:30,920
Look, it's me and the wieflings. We're gonna take them black ropes together

3765
03:01:33,160 --> 03:01:35,160
My little wiefling

3766
03:01:37,480 --> 03:01:38,840
You're so good

3767
03:01:38,840 --> 03:01:43,000
Oh my god wiefling you're actually so well placed. I can probably do this

3768
03:01:46,840 --> 03:01:49,240
That wiefling literally I know

3769
03:01:54,520 --> 03:01:59,240
Thank you for your helpful advice some events happen that would have hurt a lot more if I hadn't thought of you

3770
03:01:59,800 --> 03:02:06,040
What you told me you give me strength. Oh, I don't know what advice I gave but I'm glad it could help in the moment

3771
03:02:06,360 --> 03:02:08,360
You are

3772
03:02:09,400 --> 03:02:11,400
very strong

3773
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:12,920
Your is

3774
03:02:12,920 --> 03:02:17,800
Some sometimes you could actually say you're as strong as your weakest days because on your weakest days

3775
03:02:17,880 --> 03:02:21,560
You just want to give up but you didn't so you're as strong as your weakest days

3776
03:02:23,400 --> 03:02:25,400
Does that make sense?

3777
03:02:26,200 --> 03:02:28,200
I don't know. Maybe it does

3778
03:02:28,680 --> 03:02:35,800
Keep your keep your chin up wiefling your headset's falling off king. Okay. Come on. We gamers out here. We memers

3779
03:02:36,760 --> 03:02:38,760
We're just memers

3780
03:02:39,480 --> 03:02:41,480
We memer low

3781
03:02:41,800 --> 03:02:43,800
away

3782
03:02:44,440 --> 03:02:46,360
No, it does not

3783
03:02:46,360 --> 03:02:50,760
Looks like a hair. She's kiss leave my hair. She kissed addicted wiefling alone

3784
03:02:51,720 --> 03:02:58,360
Hearts full balls empty should be a bit a vealers official catchphrase. That's amazing

3785
03:03:00,200 --> 03:03:03,320
Oh bucket tape. Thank you for becoming a member

3786
03:03:03,320 --> 03:03:05,320
Bye

3787
03:03:05,640 --> 03:03:11,000
Membership streams are revealed next tomorrow in the next 24 hours. You will know

3788
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:14,200
You will know

3789
03:03:14,520 --> 03:03:16,040
and

3790
03:03:16,040 --> 03:03:18,040
But yeah

3791
03:03:23,320 --> 03:03:25,320
My mouse

3792
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:29,000
See you it's because of not actually

3793
03:03:29,960 --> 03:03:32,280
Right, hold on. Let me I'll tell you some lore in a minute

3794
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:35,800
The reason my mouse does that

3795
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:42,280
Is because the light and is very low as well as I've actually not synced up my vtuber model

3796
03:03:42,440 --> 03:03:47,160
Nari rigged me so well like she made me so well

3797
03:03:47,240 --> 03:03:52,040
I actually haven't gone into the calibrations to make strongy like the

3798
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:57,240
The mecca like reactive to the microphone or whatever

3799
03:03:57,880 --> 03:04:03,400
Um, so like Nari is just that good. I love your fangs. Oh, yeah, do you love them enough to you know?

3800
03:04:04,840 --> 03:04:06,840
Let me

3801
03:04:07,240 --> 03:04:09,240
In your Frankfurt

3802
03:04:11,240 --> 03:04:17,240
Hey, right, let me get my wee marshmallow link. Where did I even send the marshmallow link? I don't even think I did

3803
03:04:17,320 --> 03:04:19,320
Oh my god, I'm gatekeeping my own marshmallow

3804
03:04:20,520 --> 03:04:22,440
pay the bow

3805
03:04:22,440 --> 03:04:24,440
Can you see?

3806
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:30,760
Wow, you guys can tell that I am not all there in the head from that message

3807
03:04:32,360 --> 03:04:34,360
I am not all there in the head, but that's okay

3808
03:04:35,880 --> 03:04:37,880
Oh

3809
03:04:38,120 --> 03:04:41,000
Yes, you strongy. No strongy. Yes

3810
03:04:42,200 --> 03:04:47,080
Why would you say no to me? I'm not supposed to say no to me. You know what happens when you say no

3811
03:04:47,400 --> 03:04:49,400
This

3812
03:04:50,680 --> 03:04:53,080
But that part comes later not yet soon

3813
03:04:53,960 --> 03:04:56,920
But yes, um, it is a smaller stream

3814
03:04:57,640 --> 03:05:02,760
But the smaller stream I actually thought it was going to be eight hours, but because it's not eight hours

3815
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:06,680
I'm actually going to have the energy to go edit. So I might have my first

3816
03:05:06,840 --> 03:05:12,360
Thank you for 1000 audio uploaded on youtube on here for free all yours all yours

3817
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:19,560
I will also upload the audio file to patreon as a archive to make sure nothing is lost to time itself

3818
03:05:20,120 --> 03:05:23,560
Um, and I will take it from there

3819
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:26,840
my next patreon

3820
03:05:27,960 --> 03:05:29,400
audio

3821
03:05:29,400 --> 03:05:36,040
Should technically actually be uploaded on the 22nd, but I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna let it be a bit funny

3822
03:05:36,360 --> 03:05:41,560
I'm gonna the first month on patreon is funny. You still get four audios on patreon, but they're just a bit funky

3823
03:05:41,800 --> 03:05:45,880
They're spaced out a bit weird. Uh g-man stew. Thank you for coming on

3824
03:05:47,320 --> 03:05:49,720
What happens when we say no you get hypnotized?

3825
03:05:50,600 --> 03:05:52,600
You don't have a choice

3826
03:05:53,160 --> 03:05:55,160
You don't have a choice

3827
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:59,160
And I don't I don't care. I don't care if that sounds our wordy. You don't have a choice

3828
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:04,280
But you you you'll come to learn to like that. You don't have a choice. That's terrible

3829
03:06:04,360 --> 03:06:07,400
I can't say that stuff out loud and yet I do what happens next

3830
03:06:08,200 --> 03:06:10,040
Hmm what happens next?

3831
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:13,160
Outrageous streamer says some something outrageous. Oh, oh no, okay

3832
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:21,480
Uh glad you enjoyed my three page story. It was so good. Maybe can I maybe read it? I'm gonna see if I can read it

3833
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:24,760
okay

3834
03:06:24,760 --> 03:06:29,080
Stroney has just finished taking a shower and calls her wreathlings into her room

3835
03:06:30,040 --> 03:06:34,920
Hi there wreathlings. Stroney said oh in a sultry voice. Hi there wreathling

3836
03:06:35,640 --> 03:06:37,640
Stroney says in a sultry voice

3837
03:06:39,320 --> 03:06:42,760
Mummy is ovulating and it's time for a new gen

3838
03:06:44,040 --> 03:06:47,400
Can you all last long enough to satisfy me and get the job done?

3839
03:06:48,680 --> 03:06:51,720
She drops her towel and lies down on the bed

3840
03:06:52,440 --> 03:06:54,280
wreathlings approach

3841
03:06:54,280 --> 03:07:00,520
Slowly sliding a tentacle or two. I don't think I can read this. I don't think I can read this. I'm like

3842
03:07:01,400 --> 03:07:03,400
I don't think I could substitute

3843
03:07:03,960 --> 03:07:07,560
Slowly sliding a tentacle or two up Stroney's legs and arms

3844
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:13,560
And across her stomach massaging her body so she can relax after a long stream. She just finished

3845
03:07:14,920 --> 03:07:20,280
Eventually some wrap their tent. Yeah, I can't read the rest of it. I guess really I guess really uh

3846
03:07:22,120 --> 03:07:28,680
But um, I wouldn't actually mind if you guys want to send me like little mini scripts like that

3847
03:07:28,680 --> 03:07:32,680
I honestly wouldn't mind just reading them and then putting them on the alt

3848
03:07:33,720 --> 03:07:35,880
Twitter just for fun just for a little

3849
03:07:36,440 --> 03:07:38,440
Uh something something

3850
03:07:38,600 --> 03:07:41,400
I can't be here then somewhere. Please. Yes

3851
03:07:42,120 --> 03:07:47,960
Um, it was a very cute story about how gen two is going to be produced with me in the replay

3852
03:07:49,080 --> 03:07:53,960
Um, I honestly don't mind. I find that stuff adorable and my voice isn't too fried right now

3853
03:07:53,960 --> 03:07:58,760
So I might be able to do it today. Um, do let me cook though. But yes, you guys are welcome

3854
03:07:59,080 --> 03:08:02,120
Um for me, I don't know the comfort level of the girls yet

3855
03:08:02,200 --> 03:08:06,600
So please don't apply what I am comfortable with to the girls. They are their own individuals

3856
03:08:06,920 --> 03:08:08,680
They are their own creatives

3857
03:08:08,760 --> 03:08:12,600
But if you guys ever want to send me a short script and just say please mummy

3858
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:20,440
Um, or if you commission an artwork of me, um, you know a strong so you're welcome to say I

3859
03:08:21,400 --> 03:08:23,400
Or did you know I

3860
03:08:23,560 --> 03:08:27,240
Saw this fan art and I came up with the script if you want to combine the two together

3861
03:08:27,320 --> 03:08:32,920
Please do and put it on the alt twitter. I am happy to do that. I am very open to this. So, um

3862
03:08:33,560 --> 03:08:38,360
And it's completely free to access. I will not, you know, pay a wallet not not not my job

3863
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:43,720
But I won't I won't pay wall. Um, like little short scripts and fun fans submitted

3864
03:08:44,600 --> 03:08:48,760
Stuff. I'm a fan. I don't like the word fan. You're not a fan. You're my reflet

3865
03:08:50,520 --> 03:08:56,520
Have the girls heard of the tinfoil right rants if so, what's the reaction? Oh, I'm too embarrassed to tell them

3866
03:08:57,400 --> 03:09:06,840
Um, I'm too embarrassed to like tell them how much I like despise debt and credit cards and how like the economies rigged against them, especially because like

3867
03:09:07,640 --> 03:09:08,920
um

3868
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:12,760
They may or may not live in America, which makes it even like

3869
03:09:13,880 --> 03:09:15,880
Everything is against them

3870
03:09:16,040 --> 03:09:20,200
Like she'd be told a story about her crashing a car and then she jumped off a cliff or something

3871
03:09:21,160 --> 03:09:26,520
I'm like, yeah, I'm too embarrassed to tell the girls that part. I just say to them like, oh, you're doing great. Um

3872
03:09:27,400 --> 03:09:31,320
I just need this ASMR script from you. I'll edit the rest. You guys just have fun

3873
03:09:33,720 --> 03:09:37,960
It's too late for me. It's over two weeks and I hear your voice in my head all the time

3874
03:09:39,080 --> 03:09:43,080
Have I successfully mind broken you dear refling?

3875
03:09:44,440 --> 03:09:46,440
Why do you act like you don't want to?

3876
03:09:49,080 --> 03:09:51,080
Let it happen

3877
03:09:51,080 --> 03:09:53,720
Let me see into every part of you

3878
03:09:54,600 --> 03:09:56,600
Until it's all

3879
03:10:02,840 --> 03:10:06,440
Glad I could mind break you though. I've not even done that part of the hypnosis yet

3880
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:15,080
I mean, we ain't even done the tear list yet where I explain in detail every scenario I want to do to you because of that tag

3881
03:10:19,080 --> 03:10:21,080
Hydration check

3882
03:10:24,520 --> 03:10:27,880
Stroni you make me fragile when you talk like that. That's why I do it

3883
03:10:30,040 --> 03:10:33,000
They're gonna be a little me mark and be all happy and stuff

3884
03:10:35,080 --> 03:10:37,080
But I do like the juxtaposition

3885
03:10:38,920 --> 03:10:41,400
As well as many other positions hold on a minute

3886
03:10:43,080 --> 03:10:45,080
Thank you

3887
03:10:45,400 --> 03:10:47,000
Here all week

3888
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,400
Dear mommy. Oh, I did beat that one

3889
03:10:53,960 --> 03:10:55,960
Oh

3890
03:10:59,800 --> 03:11:03,240
Wow someone's analizing my ovulation cycle

3891
03:11:04,120 --> 03:11:08,680
So a normal ovulation cycle lasts about 24 hours each month. This is correct

3892
03:11:09,080 --> 03:11:12,840
Once an egg is released from an ovary it will dissolve within 12 to 24 hours

3893
03:11:13,800 --> 03:11:18,520
If it's not fertilized and the window is about a week before ovulation since seeds survive for almost a week

3894
03:11:18,760 --> 03:11:20,440
so basically

3895
03:11:20,440 --> 03:11:27,160
If I was to try and fertilize you I would need to do it the day before for optimum success chance

3896
03:11:27,240 --> 03:11:29,240
Which means the 13th of the month

3897
03:11:29,880 --> 03:11:32,600
All refling you went gen 2 already

3898
03:11:33,480 --> 03:11:37,640
You missed your window of opportunity. You're gonna have to try again next month with me, huh?

3899
03:11:38,440 --> 03:11:41,880
And we'll just keep trying and trying and trying

3900
03:11:46,200 --> 03:11:48,200
Uh

3901
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:50,360
Okay

3902
03:11:54,360 --> 03:11:56,360
Hi, strongy. Hi replaying

3903
03:11:57,640 --> 03:12:00,760
Just wanted to say that I appreciate your content so far

3904
03:12:01,720 --> 03:12:04,600
Well, I absolutely continue support. Oh, thank you. I'm glad I'm glad

3905
03:12:05,080 --> 03:12:09,320
I'm a bit nervous sending you my first marshmallow. Oh, don't worry. I don't bite

3906
03:12:10,360 --> 03:12:12,360
hard

3907
03:12:12,520 --> 03:12:14,200
Uh

3908
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:19,000
But I'll be sure to send you some more stuff in the future quick question any advice for aspiring script writers

3909
03:12:19,080 --> 03:12:24,520
Make sure to smash that like button and subscribe to my marshmallow account for more content. What?

3910
03:12:25,800 --> 03:12:27,800
What does that mean? Um

3911
03:12:28,120 --> 03:12:34,040
Any advice for aspiring script writers consume content and then do what you like

3912
03:12:35,080 --> 03:12:41,640
The easiest way for things to naturally occur and no then again. I am I have a raging

3913
03:12:42,200 --> 03:12:47,400
Uh tism over things which helps me like just absolutely work out the wazoo

3914
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:50,440
Um, whenever I'm presented with a new

3915
03:12:51,320 --> 03:12:54,040
Special interest that I'm being educated about

3916
03:12:55,160 --> 03:13:00,440
I will consume multiple videos of that content. I will I'll put them in times too so I can

3917
03:13:01,240 --> 03:13:05,080
Understand the language that's being used the scenario or situation

3918
03:13:05,560 --> 03:13:11,000
Um, and then I just say I like this part, but I didn't like this part. I will do this

3919
03:13:11,800 --> 03:13:16,200
And I will do that and make it my own. That's basically how I tip scripts

3920
03:13:17,560 --> 03:13:21,800
It's not that it's not like saying honestly, the behind the scenes is rather boring

3921
03:13:24,200 --> 03:13:28,280
Hmm do risky things happen on membership stream. I don't know

3922
03:13:29,480 --> 03:13:32,520
Uh, we're doing a tag rating stream

3923
03:13:33,880 --> 03:13:40,520
Uh for my first stream ever doing a watch along. Um, I think we're actually watching transformers

3924
03:13:40,920 --> 03:13:43,400
The first transformers were sam wit wiki

3925
03:13:43,880 --> 03:13:48,360
Sam congrats if you're named sam by the way, but his name is sam wit wiki

3926
03:13:50,040 --> 03:13:53,400
His marshmallow cherry yonk my cherry now

3927
03:13:54,840 --> 03:13:59,320
Reflings have six tentacles you have eight you have eight arms

3928
03:14:00,200 --> 03:14:02,200
But you make a little love heart

3929
03:14:02,840 --> 03:14:08,040
With your front tentacles because we love each other and you got your little nicotine that

3930
03:14:08,040 --> 03:14:10,040
With

3931
03:14:10,680 --> 03:14:12,680
Actual cannibal shy and the buff

3932
03:14:13,640 --> 03:14:18,680
The o7 movie. Yeah, like it's like we're she a love off shy a love off. Sorry. She uh

3933
03:14:19,640 --> 03:14:21,640
She ain't love off. Um

3934
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:24,440
Did you enjoy

3935
03:14:24,680 --> 03:14:26,680
The filian fanfic?

3936
03:14:28,120 --> 03:14:34,040
It'll be on fanfic or this local filian fanfic. Oh, I

3937
03:14:35,480 --> 03:14:37,480
Don't know where the location of that was

3938
03:14:38,040 --> 03:14:40,040
I

3939
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:57,320
You know stroney my phone broke recently and all it did was glow green and start moving up and down

3940
03:14:57,560 --> 03:15:00,360
Kind of like when you start glowing it reminds me of you

3941
03:15:01,720 --> 03:15:07,160
Your phone broke. I'm I'm literally hacking into your technology right now. So you become even more obsessed

3942
03:15:07,720 --> 03:15:09,720
It's working

3943
03:15:09,720 --> 03:15:12,440
The nicotine patch subdues you for a little bit, but

3944
03:15:13,400 --> 03:15:17,160
Unfortunately, I get a bit too intense, which is why I need to subdue you

3945
03:15:18,680 --> 03:15:21,880
Editing a silly burp compilation of one of the girls. What do you think?

3946
03:15:22,440 --> 03:15:23,640
Uh

3947
03:15:23,640 --> 03:15:30,040
Yeah, I don't see why not. I'm not being funny. Someone said that a she be let out a to

3948
03:15:30,920 --> 03:15:34,680
I didn't I'm gonna freaking message she be after the stream and be like

3949
03:15:34,840 --> 03:15:36,920
Can I clip your to because whenever

3950
03:15:38,280 --> 03:15:41,560
A toot gets clipped. Um, all of a sudden

3951
03:15:42,280 --> 03:15:45,640
Um, it's like super funny and ha ha and all of that

3952
03:15:46,200 --> 03:15:48,200
um, so literally the start of the

3953
03:15:48,920 --> 03:15:52,520
Short is going to be like brian tts being like vtuber

3954
03:15:53,160 --> 03:15:55,160
accidentally farts on stream

3955
03:15:55,240 --> 03:15:59,720
And and play the clip and then oh, oh a hundred thousand views, please

3956
03:16:00,200 --> 03:16:03,320
Please give she be a cabillion subscribers. Yeah

3957
03:16:04,280 --> 03:16:07,720
Need to go ask the girls. I literally I need to go put in the discord

3958
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:13,000
If any of you have farted, uh, please let me know so I can clip it if you're comfortable. Let's be clipping it

3959
03:16:13,160 --> 03:16:15,720
Oh my god edit my gen mates part. Oh

3960
03:16:17,640 --> 03:16:23,240
What a weird timeline we live in my ancestors were peasants working in the fields

3961
03:16:23,560 --> 03:16:30,040
If only they knew that the one who surpassed like the bloodline ends up editing a toot

3962
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:35,640
Do you think my ancestors would laugh at that or they'd just be like what is going on over there? They're like, no, I can't handle this

3963
03:16:38,280 --> 03:16:44,360
Oh the archive of our own link. No, I didn't read it. Yeah, I got a bit nervous because I don't know what archive of our own is

3964
03:16:44,440 --> 03:16:46,440
I think it's just for text and stuff

3965
03:16:47,400 --> 03:16:49,400
um

3966
03:16:50,520 --> 03:16:55,480
I'm sorry mummy, but when you rage at games, I think of you are wording me with that passion

3967
03:16:56,440 --> 03:17:00,520
Or replaying. I don't think we're allowed to say that out loud

3968
03:17:02,440 --> 03:17:04,440
But that's hot

3969
03:17:05,960 --> 03:17:10,360
That's amazing. Have you ever played metal gear before I haven't

3970
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:16,840
Um, is it easy if it's easy? I'll play it. Is there a story mode for gamers like me?

3971
03:17:19,240 --> 03:17:24,840
He's just the one that's saying it out loud wait post that meme where it's the guy like standing up

3972
03:17:24,840 --> 03:17:30,040
Hold on. Wait standing up meme guy. Uh, he's like standing up in a courtroom

3973
03:17:30,760 --> 03:17:34,760
Oh my god, I've got it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

3974
03:17:34,920 --> 03:17:40,760
Wait, let me make the meme. Let me make the meme. No one say a thing or I'm gonna forget how to make the meme

3975
03:17:40,840 --> 03:17:42,840
Okay, I've got the jpeg

3976
03:17:43,240 --> 03:17:49,400
And then I need to open it up in ms pain. Hold on. Let me open up the picture in ms pain

3977
03:17:49,640 --> 03:17:51,960
No one say a thing. Okay. Let me cook

3978
03:17:52,600 --> 03:17:54,600
Let me cook

3979
03:17:54,920 --> 03:17:56,920
Let me

3980
03:17:57,240 --> 03:17:58,440
Cook

3981
03:17:58,440 --> 03:18:02,600
Let me cook. This is so bad. This is terrible

3982
03:18:03,800 --> 03:18:06,200
Reflins, you're such a naughty influence on me

3983
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:11,000
Said by one refling together

3984
03:18:13,720 --> 03:18:19,960
Okay, is that gonna work? I mean, I think it's gonna work. Yeah, okay, it's working

3985
03:18:20,120 --> 03:18:29,640
You can tell of me this is an ms pain. Oh my god. Hold on. Are you ready for this? Are you ready?

3986
03:18:36,280 --> 03:18:41,640
Oh, we are lost it. Oh no, it's like we're down here. This is literally

3987
03:18:41,640 --> 03:18:43,640
Oh

3988
03:18:48,120 --> 03:18:50,120
No

3989
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:54,200
A thing thank you for the tip slice saver

3990
03:18:58,200 --> 03:19:03,800
Refling you're standing up against the masses. You're so brave for saying that part out loud

3991
03:19:04,600 --> 03:19:06,600
Oh

3992
03:19:06,920 --> 03:19:11,160
That's so terrible. I hope no other beach ever comes in stream and sees that

3993
03:19:12,040 --> 03:19:15,160
Oh my god, that's terrible

3994
03:19:15,800 --> 03:19:23,240
Why are we like this together? We bring out the worst side in each other like the the degenerate side in each other

3995
03:19:23,880 --> 03:19:25,880
honestly

3996
03:19:26,360 --> 03:19:28,360
Hmm

3997
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:34,200
Moment are you gonna take the bit of some little test again? Yeah, I'll take it

3998
03:19:35,880 --> 03:19:37,320
Um

3999
03:19:37,320 --> 03:19:39,320
We can 100% do that stuff

4000
03:19:39,960 --> 03:19:44,760
I have no problem with that stuff. Where's the mean best? He speaks the truth

4001
03:19:45,320 --> 03:19:50,520
And they hated him for he spoke the truth. I can't I'm not gonna edit into that Jesus meme

4002
03:19:51,320 --> 03:19:53,320
I

4003
03:19:53,720 --> 03:19:58,280
Hi, Stony. I want you to bite me all over and leave marks all over me including on my tentacle. I

4004
03:19:59,160 --> 03:20:01,960
I wouldn't do it hard. Okay. I wouldn't do it hard

4005
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:05,480
I would do it to a degree

4006
03:20:05,480 --> 03:20:11,240
Okay, I'm all caught up with marshmallows. So I'm just gonna be staring at you now chat. What are you gonna do about it, huh?

4007
03:20:12,840 --> 03:20:14,680
What are you gonna do? Sorry, I'm burping away over here

4008
03:20:15,400 --> 03:20:21,560
We're a match made in something probably not heaven because we can't make it into heaven

4009
03:20:21,880 --> 03:20:26,440
With this stuff that we go on about we can't make it into heaven. Oh, no

4010
03:20:28,280 --> 03:20:30,280
Stare back

4011
03:20:34,120 --> 03:20:37,800
I feel like I could uh, I'm terrible at blinking contests

4012
03:20:38,520 --> 03:20:44,360
I remember everyone in the playground was like, oh, I do do stare contest and I would always lose because I suck

4013
03:20:44,760 --> 03:20:47,960
I'm already in heaven. No need to go elsewhere

4014
03:20:50,200 --> 03:20:58,440
Will the member streams be archived? I may not be able to tune in. I'm not gonna try and get them banned. No, I think we'll be okay

4015
03:21:00,200 --> 03:21:02,200
We're gonna use our euphemisms

4016
03:21:03,800 --> 03:21:05,800
Where I go tentacle and ink

4017
03:21:06,840 --> 03:21:08,440
And I want to

4018
03:21:08,440 --> 03:21:10,440
Ink on the tentacle

4019
03:21:12,280 --> 03:21:14,280
Because we're cut off fish out here

4020
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:17,000
We're cephalopods

4021
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:23,000
But together we're a cephalopog because we're so cool like that. Yeah pogger

4022
03:21:25,080 --> 03:21:27,080
Um

4023
03:21:27,080 --> 03:21:33,320
Have I ever heard about the gates by ass rock? I'm so sorry. I've never heard of that in my life

4024
03:21:33,480 --> 03:21:35,480
We're all stuck in perigatory

4025
03:21:35,800 --> 03:21:37,800
Keep that in mind

4026
03:21:38,120 --> 03:21:46,120
Because there may or may not be a collab with a va and all viola members that is related to purgatory. So keep that in mind

4027
03:21:47,960 --> 03:21:50,440
Uh, funny you brought a funny you brought that up. Yeah

4028
03:21:51,800 --> 03:21:59,720
Um, imagine pieta, but it's the virgin mary given jesus. Whoa. We we can't be saying that stuff out loud

4029
03:21:59,880 --> 03:22:01,880
That's those are inside thoughts

4030
03:22:03,960 --> 03:22:05,960
Oh sense interesting. Yeah

4031
03:22:06,920 --> 03:22:08,920
You better be excited

4032
03:22:09,800 --> 03:22:13,640
I like when strony spoils. I try my best. I do

4033
03:22:14,200 --> 03:22:18,600
I the dust is definitely settling on my list of stuff to do

4034
03:22:19,400 --> 03:22:23,240
Like a lot of things are becoming a lot easier. Um

4035
03:22:24,680 --> 03:22:29,640
And it's getting to the point where I can fully be strummer. Yes, I can be strummer. Um

4036
03:22:31,880 --> 03:22:33,400
I

4037
03:22:33,400 --> 03:22:37,240
I wouldn't mind having a clip manager, but sadly, um

4038
03:22:38,680 --> 03:22:40,840
I don't have anyone. Um

4039
03:22:42,920 --> 03:22:45,000
I trust to be in that position

4040
03:22:46,360 --> 03:22:47,640
Um

4041
03:22:47,640 --> 03:22:53,560
Because clip manager needs access to the girls accounts to see what people have been clipping and it ain't gonna happen

4042
03:22:53,800 --> 03:22:54,600
so

4043
03:22:54,600 --> 03:22:58,200
Unfortunately, I am still clip manager at this point in time

4044
03:22:58,360 --> 03:23:02,600
But it's not too bad because literally I just take a clip and then I send it to editor and then editor comes back

4045
03:23:02,680 --> 03:23:06,920
And then I upload it on girls channel and it's all hunky dory. It's not a problem

4046
03:23:08,920 --> 03:23:12,760
Strummer I like when strony you didn't finish your sentence

4047
03:23:16,280 --> 03:23:22,840
Mummy protecting her doors. Yes. Um, I will be your shield. I know not a lot you play overwatch

4048
03:23:22,920 --> 03:23:26,600
I used to play it quite a lot. Sadly, I fell out of love with it. Um

4049
03:23:27,160 --> 03:23:32,200
When overwatch 2 came out, but there is a girl called

4050
03:23:34,280 --> 03:23:39,240
Brigitte Lenthal and her slogan is I will be your shield

4051
03:23:40,120 --> 03:23:43,320
And yes, I am Brigitte for my gen mates

4052
03:23:43,960 --> 03:23:46,840
Because I don't want anything happening to them

4053
03:23:47,560 --> 03:23:49,080
and

4054
03:23:49,080 --> 03:23:51,400
So I'm the I am both the owl and the shield

4055
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:55,560
I love when strony does anything

4056
03:23:56,600 --> 03:24:01,560
Yes, uh tomorrow's stream. I'm gonna see if I can get my heart rate monitor working. Um

4057
03:24:02,840 --> 03:24:03,960
So

4058
03:24:03,960 --> 03:24:06,520
I should be able to do that

4059
03:24:07,320 --> 03:24:10,200
And then you can see my heart rate during buckshot roulette

4060
03:24:10,760 --> 03:24:15,480
I didn't manage to watch any more baltral content because I literally I finished stream

4061
03:24:16,280 --> 03:24:20,680
I did I see an emmy's memberships and then

4062
03:24:21,480 --> 03:24:25,320
Then what would I do? I don't know. Um, and then I went on twitter

4063
03:24:25,400 --> 03:24:29,320
I think I liked one thing and then passed out and then I woke up like

4064
03:24:30,920 --> 03:24:32,920
45 minutes before stream

4065
03:24:33,400 --> 03:24:39,560
I probably needed a big sleep like that. Like it was coming. It was coming that I needed a sleep like that

4066
03:24:41,240 --> 03:24:44,040
Strony that was the whole sentence. Wait, what was the sentence?

4067
03:24:45,640 --> 03:24:47,640
That's the whole sentence

4068
03:24:48,200 --> 03:24:50,920
I also like when strony I do like when strony

4069
03:24:51,480 --> 03:24:53,480
But why are clips private?

4070
03:24:54,120 --> 03:24:59,000
I don't know youtube doesn't let people see what people have clipped on

4071
03:25:00,120 --> 03:25:02,360
live stream or any content really

4072
03:25:03,160 --> 03:25:10,520
If it was public then I could get a clip master, but I can't get a clip master because they're not public

4073
03:25:11,400 --> 03:25:17,560
But hopefully youtube changes that in a couple of months because that would then negate me even needing to

4074
03:25:17,640 --> 03:25:22,520
Be a clip master. Um, and then I can spend even more time

4075
03:25:23,640 --> 03:25:25,640
We're briefly wait. They're not

4076
03:25:26,200 --> 03:25:35,560
Do you remember sending marshmallows to the girls? I remember completely crashing on yesterday's stream for anyone who wasn't watching the runescape stream

4077
03:25:36,360 --> 03:25:38,840
I hit the 11 hour mark and became

4078
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:46,280
Delirious I spilled all my chips on the floor when I ended stream and I just left them until this morning to clean up

4079
03:25:47,640 --> 03:25:51,000
I was gone with the wind. I

4080
03:25:51,960 --> 03:25:59,080
I don't know what happened. I ate food and I was like, oh, this will wake me up. This will wake me up. No, it freaking didn't

4081
03:25:59,960 --> 03:26:00,840
day

4082
03:26:00,840 --> 03:26:04,840
One day we'll hit 12 hours for old school runescape. Honestly

4083
03:26:05,720 --> 03:26:07,720
um

4084
03:26:07,720 --> 03:26:09,720
No, I didn't have any issues with the

4085
03:26:10,360 --> 03:26:14,200
Playing it but I like completely crashed the ending of the stream was so funny

4086
03:26:14,600 --> 03:26:18,360
I just remember being like, oh, let me send the girl some marshmallows

4087
03:26:18,440 --> 03:26:23,160
And then I started typing and I don't really remember what the contents of it were but hopefully

4088
03:26:24,040 --> 03:26:26,040
All is good. Um

4089
03:26:26,760 --> 03:26:28,760
But yeah, I remember just

4090
03:26:29,080 --> 03:26:31,080
Freaking losing it basically

4091
03:26:31,560 --> 03:26:33,480
I crashed way before that part of stream

4092
03:26:33,960 --> 03:26:38,280
You used up all your energy trying to win connect for unironically. Oh my god

4093
03:26:38,520 --> 03:26:43,800
If you didn't see runescape stream quick recap in runescape, you can play connect for

4094
03:26:44,360 --> 03:26:46,120
I was getting

4095
03:26:46,120 --> 03:26:47,640
decimated

4096
03:26:47,640 --> 03:26:48,760
like

4097
03:26:48,760 --> 03:26:51,960
The reeflings were like ganging up on me just

4098
03:26:52,440 --> 03:26:59,480
Fucking one at a time one after the other like bro. I just accepted my fate. I could not win at connect for

4099
03:27:00,040 --> 03:27:04,440
One I won one because I tried so hard and burnt my brain

4100
03:27:05,160 --> 03:27:09,720
The second one I won by accident because a reefling couldn't see what I was doing

4101
03:27:10,200 --> 03:27:13,320
Um, I was gonna absolutely destroy

4102
03:27:14,040 --> 03:27:17,880
Yeah, I remember my sleep fading and then some strange noises coming up

4103
03:27:18,760 --> 03:27:20,040
Um

4104
03:27:20,040 --> 03:27:23,160
It sounds like a fun time bro. I was perishing

4105
03:27:23,800 --> 03:27:28,840
I don't know what happened because normally I can last 12 hours and I had an eight hour sleep before it

4106
03:27:28,840 --> 03:27:35,240
But my brain oh my stomach just made a noise if you heard that my brain just perished like it had enough

4107
03:27:35,320 --> 03:27:37,320
It was like, I'm sorry. I can't hold out anymore

4108
03:27:38,280 --> 03:27:43,880
Checkers. Oh, no, I'm not playing checkers again. That was the most confusing thing. I couldn't even bro

4109
03:27:44,200 --> 03:27:47,960
We were playing checkers and I couldn't even move on the board

4110
03:27:48,520 --> 03:27:52,200
Because I didn't know what was like going on

4111
03:27:53,080 --> 03:27:57,080
Um with the dang thing. It was a redonkula. Hold on

4112
03:27:57,880 --> 03:28:02,680
Uh, I'm just gonna pin the marshmallow. Oh my god. That's me. That sounds like that

4113
03:28:03,560 --> 03:28:05,560
Q and a

4114
03:28:06,440 --> 03:28:08,760
I say q and a is if we don't just like

4115
03:28:09,960 --> 03:28:14,760
That's not the q and a length. Hold on a minute. That's the that's what the reefling said

4116
03:28:15,960 --> 03:28:21,640
Wait a minute. Who are you? I need to draw any cuttles. There we go. That's one

4117
03:28:23,400 --> 03:28:26,280
Bit of q and a q

4118
03:28:27,160 --> 03:28:29,160
and

4119
03:28:29,480 --> 03:28:31,000
Boom

4120
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:37,160
Uh, it's not really a q and a is it just you guys being lovely to me and then I go in a ramble and I see how lovely

4121
03:28:37,880 --> 03:28:39,160
um

4122
03:28:39,160 --> 03:28:41,880
It is to be here strong a leaks. Oh, yeah

4123
03:28:43,640 --> 03:28:45,640
Oh, no, I sent it to myself now

4124
03:28:46,360 --> 03:28:49,160
Oh, no, I've been discovered. I send myself all these marshmallows

4125
03:28:49,960 --> 03:28:55,880
I fell asleep to your stream and my brother was very much questioning what on earth you were watching when you woke up

4126
03:28:56,120 --> 03:28:58,120
Just me raging

4127
03:28:59,400 --> 03:29:04,200
I choked on my burrito rage and actually which was that makes it like 10 times funnier

4128
03:29:05,400 --> 03:29:07,400
so

4129
03:29:07,720 --> 03:29:09,720
And then I'm rage

4130
03:29:10,120 --> 03:29:16,760
Hi, mommy. I don't know what to ask, but I really love watching you. Oh, glad you're so funny, bro

4131
03:29:17,320 --> 03:29:20,200
You're giving me an ego. We all know the forbidden rule

4132
03:29:20,760 --> 03:29:24,360
Uh, just genuinely entertaining in more ways than when a yeah

4133
03:29:25,320 --> 03:29:33,000
Your streams always make me smile and giggle. Oh, you have any giggle mate. Please keep it up to te amo hemosa

4134
03:29:34,200 --> 03:29:36,200
Much love from

4135
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:44,120
Te amo portarico come to brazil. No, we're not I'm not going to brazil, but thank you for inviting me. No

4136
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,000
Thank you for the nice uh little message

4137
03:29:47,800 --> 03:29:53,640
How do you feel about the dragon age games? Particularly the upcoming veil guard game? Um

4138
03:29:55,240 --> 03:29:59,960
I've never played a dragon quest game properly. Sorry a dragon age game properly

4139
03:30:00,440 --> 03:30:06,040
Uh, I played the one where brother and sister and then brother like immediately. Well, I said for the brother or die

4140
03:30:06,280 --> 03:30:10,440
I think I played it for like 30 minutes and I was like, oh this ain't for me

4141
03:30:12,200 --> 03:30:18,040
Um, but there seems to be quite a lot of fans that are distraught at the reveal because they don't like it

4142
03:30:18,200 --> 03:30:20,200
but I thought it was just uh

4143
03:30:20,280 --> 03:30:22,920
I think why do we hate brazil? No, it's a meme

4144
03:30:23,560 --> 03:30:28,600
Where it's like, oh come to brazil do a concert in brazil, but brazil's really dangerous for foreigners

4145
03:30:29,080 --> 03:30:31,080
We don't actually hate brazil

4146
03:30:32,280 --> 03:30:36,760
Hi stronti, I agree with that one riff riefling when you rage. I always think of you

4147
03:30:37,720 --> 03:30:39,720
pinning me down and having your

4148
03:30:40,040 --> 03:30:41,880
your way with me

4149
03:30:41,880 --> 03:30:46,280
And then not stopping even when I finish. Oh my god, rieflings. This is good

4150
03:30:47,240 --> 03:30:49,640
I don't think we could say any of this out loud

4151
03:30:51,320 --> 03:30:57,560
What if I'm here because I was hypnotized by a moment. Maybe the hypnosis is listening up. We should hypnotize more

4152
03:30:58,680 --> 03:31:01,400
Not yet. You have to wait. You have to wait

4153
03:31:02,280 --> 03:31:04,280
soon

4154
03:31:04,280 --> 03:31:06,280
It's overtism

4155
03:31:06,360 --> 03:31:08,360
We're hitting overdrive

4156
03:31:09,160 --> 03:31:11,880
What was that stream song overdrive?

4157
03:31:12,360 --> 03:31:14,200
Burning machine

4158
03:31:14,200 --> 03:31:16,440
Oh brain power. That's it brain power

4159
03:31:22,120 --> 03:31:26,920
How did you decide which of the generation one models were going to be used?

4160
03:31:27,400 --> 03:31:32,600
Where are there other people auditioning for stronti? No, um, if you weren't there at the start development

4161
03:31:33,080 --> 03:31:36,600
All six models were laid out on the website under the auditions page

4162
03:31:37,160 --> 03:31:43,800
Uh, I was codename inks and it said I am a pre-selected talent, but please apply to be my gen mate

4163
03:31:44,440 --> 03:31:47,400
Uh, no one could apply for stronti because I'm stronti

4164
03:31:48,280 --> 03:31:51,960
There is only gonna be one stronti. You can't you can't get better than me. Okay

4165
03:31:53,960 --> 03:31:55,960
Uh, welcome to the danger zone

4166
03:31:57,320 --> 03:31:59,320
Ora ora

4167
03:31:59,560 --> 03:32:01,560
Um, as for who did I pick?

4168
03:32:02,040 --> 03:32:03,240
uh

4169
03:32:03,240 --> 03:32:05,000
The models for

4170
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:10,680
I did take into account what the girls went for but when I heard the girls

4171
03:32:11,080 --> 03:32:18,280
Voices it pretty much instantly my brain went oh, okay. That's gonna be enemy. Oh, okay. That's definitely I say oh, okay

4172
03:32:18,280 --> 03:32:21,640
That's mercy. Oh, that's our genre. Oh, that's she be um

4173
03:32:23,240 --> 03:32:29,800
Because I got to hear them talk in general in the introduction introduce yourself video

4174
03:32:30,200 --> 03:32:33,560
And they gave me a good indication of personality type and all that so

4175
03:32:34,200 --> 03:32:39,000
If anyone wants to complain you you hired wrong you put someone on the wrong shot

4176
03:32:40,840 --> 03:32:42,840
shot

4177
03:32:43,080 --> 03:32:44,760
Don't want to hear it

4178
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:46,440
Do you don't want to hear it?

4179
03:32:46,440 --> 03:32:52,040
Uh for a siren that can't sing you just need to ramble and yap and I'll follow you under the waves

4180
03:32:52,520 --> 03:32:54,520
I don't actually want you to perish

4181
03:32:55,080 --> 03:32:57,720
It was the concept artist that gave me that lore

4182
03:32:58,760 --> 03:33:00,760
I don't want anyone to perish

4183
03:33:01,480 --> 03:33:03,800
Hmm. Can you say shut one word to shut?

4184
03:33:07,720 --> 03:33:09,720
And you put the girl on the right shot

4185
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:13,000
Don't want to hear it

4186
03:33:13,640 --> 03:33:20,600
Don't want to hear it give I'll give you gills. Yeah, you got a good voice to listen to I am I rambling you to sleep

4187
03:33:21,400 --> 03:33:23,400
Oh, dear

4188
03:33:28,280 --> 03:33:32,600
Listen to my voice as I ramble you to sleep

4189
03:33:33,320 --> 03:33:35,320
I

4190
03:33:35,880 --> 03:33:37,880
Don't he doesn't perish. He just beats on you

4191
03:33:39,960 --> 03:33:43,400
Like the water helps with where the things I need to do to you. Okay

4192
03:33:47,000 --> 03:33:49,000
I'm gonna put you

4193
03:33:50,760 --> 03:33:53,400
Seven days no ink help, please

4194
03:33:54,440 --> 03:33:56,440
How has it been so long?

4195
03:33:57,640 --> 03:33:59,640
I say that as if I'm not

4196
03:34:00,600 --> 03:34:02,600
Backed up but

4197
03:34:03,160 --> 03:34:05,160
How what do you mean help?

4198
03:34:06,120 --> 03:34:08,120
Help

4199
03:34:09,080 --> 03:34:11,400
This kind of help is that the help you need?

4200
03:34:14,840 --> 03:34:16,840
Is that what you need?

4201
03:34:18,120 --> 03:34:22,920
I don't know what help you need you didn't specify you got to specify or I'm not gonna come up with that one

4202
03:34:23,880 --> 03:34:30,680
Hi, strongy. Are there any talents of corpus you'd like you'd like or veal or to collab within the future

4203
03:34:31,320 --> 03:34:35,480
Hey, I'm humping you me plus and I'm humping v and you because they were lovely

4204
03:34:37,240 --> 03:34:41,400
Mythos tal hq were very receptive to us as well

4205
03:34:41,560 --> 03:34:43,720
Sadly due to timing couldn't do the watch longs

4206
03:34:43,720 --> 03:34:49,000
But mythos talents seem to be kind of already leaning on the alternative side

4207
03:34:49,000 --> 03:34:52,280
Which makes me quite comfortable with them as creators

4208
03:34:53,320 --> 03:34:55,320
As for actual corporation

4209
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:57,560
tubers

4210
03:34:57,560 --> 03:35:03,960
Uh, I'm just if the person's happy with me. I'm happy with them. I never want to encroach myself on someone

4211
03:35:04,520 --> 03:35:05,800
That's not the word at all

4212
03:35:05,800 --> 03:35:12,520
I agree with those other two reef flings need mommy to take all that rage out of my tentacle until it's ink to dry. Oh my god

4213
03:35:15,240 --> 03:35:16,440
Um

4214
03:35:16,440 --> 03:35:23,000
Mom, if one were to eventually build up the courage for an audio debut

4215
03:35:23,800 --> 03:35:25,800
Oh my

4216
03:35:25,960 --> 03:35:28,680
Anything you would like to hear in specific

4217
03:35:29,640 --> 03:35:35,560
Uh, or should I just let the imagination go wild any time? No, have fun

4218
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:39,000
I eagerly await your audio

4219
03:35:43,080 --> 03:35:45,880
Where did you we're all this time are you

4220
03:35:46,600 --> 03:35:49,320
Are you trolling me? Where did you we're all this time?

4221
03:35:50,040 --> 03:35:52,040
Where was I for all this time?

4222
03:35:52,200 --> 03:35:57,240
It took me a year to cook veiler. Give me. I needed to be in the kitchen. I'm not the best at it

4223
03:35:57,240 --> 03:35:59,240
I'm level 76 right now, but

4224
03:35:59,880 --> 03:36:01,880
It takes it takes a long time. Um

4225
03:36:02,840 --> 03:36:05,400
So I was working hard or hardly working, you know

4226
03:36:07,800 --> 03:36:10,280
We love to see a reefling piled up his couch

4227
03:36:11,880 --> 03:36:15,960
Uh, I could look he go for some water right now. Y'all should hydrate hydration check

4228
03:36:16,040 --> 03:36:18,040
I actually I'm going to finish my cola

4229
03:36:22,520 --> 03:36:24,520
Um

4230
03:36:26,920 --> 03:36:32,200
What what sort of settings would you say are the most appealing in audio booths? Uh

4231
03:36:34,360 --> 03:36:36,360
Grunting

4232
03:36:37,400 --> 03:36:39,400
I'm here that

4233
03:36:41,160 --> 03:36:44,040
I would have on your legs to be numb by the end of it

4234
03:36:46,440 --> 03:36:50,360
Oh are pleading. I'm gonna be like mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy

4235
03:36:54,120 --> 03:36:57,400
I'm hydrating. Okay. I will hydrate with my beer

4236
03:36:58,600 --> 03:37:01,720
Is it the weekend? Oh, it is the weekend. You're allowed to have a beer

4237
03:37:04,200 --> 03:37:06,200
Right that time right that time

4238
03:37:06,600 --> 03:37:08,600
Are you squidding me right now?

4239
03:37:08,680 --> 03:37:09,480
I don't

4240
03:37:09,480 --> 03:37:10,600
Hello mommy

4241
03:37:10,600 --> 03:37:14,600
You were a very cute last night when you were sleeping. I hope you got enough rest

4242
03:37:14,680 --> 03:37:19,960
I did get enough my tentacles have been thoroughly inked ever since you came into my life

4243
03:37:20,200 --> 03:37:24,360
Oh, I'm glad you think so reefling. Thank you anonymous for the tip

4244
03:37:25,480 --> 03:37:27,480
Thanks for your tip anonymous

4245
03:37:28,280 --> 03:37:33,080
Thank you. I appreciate it. I'm glad you have been thoroughly de-inked

4246
03:37:34,120 --> 03:37:40,280
Ramura, Ramura. Thank you for becoming a member Ramura any Ramura remember

4247
03:37:41,160 --> 03:37:43,160
I can't remember member

4248
03:37:44,120 --> 03:37:49,320
I'm not really into this type of stuff, but for your birthday as a president you can

4249
03:37:51,640 --> 03:37:55,240
Use a figurine on me

4250
03:37:57,000 --> 03:37:59,880
For me you'd let me do that

4251
03:38:01,560 --> 03:38:05,320
Okay, October 10th is my birthday. So make sure you're all

4252
03:38:06,760 --> 03:38:10,760
Ready for what happens on October 10th

4253
03:38:11,400 --> 03:38:16,120
Are there any more indulge collabs planned in the future? Oh boy

4254
03:38:17,160 --> 03:38:19,160
Yeah, next week

4255
03:38:19,240 --> 03:38:24,280
You will be indulged out the wazoo if you mean six man indulge collabs

4256
03:38:24,280 --> 03:38:28,680
I am going to ask the girls if possible that we do one

4257
03:38:29,160 --> 03:38:32,760
Collab a month together of just hilarity and suing

4258
03:38:34,040 --> 03:38:36,040
Um, I do

4259
03:38:36,040 --> 03:38:38,040
Ah, what's that game?

4260
03:38:38,840 --> 03:38:41,480
It's hard because there's not a lot of six man games

4261
03:38:41,480 --> 03:38:46,680
So I think it might have to be stuff like among us or lethal company. I know

4262
03:38:47,320 --> 03:38:51,960
Residency for everyone plays it but the problem is there's six of us. There were many

4263
03:38:52,040 --> 03:38:55,320
I think there's a back rooms game that we can play together possibly

4264
03:38:56,040 --> 03:38:59,800
Um, I do want to do monthly six man collabs

4265
03:39:00,280 --> 03:39:04,840
Uh, but after that, um, it will be like two on two collabs. Maybe three three collabs

4266
03:39:05,560 --> 03:39:10,600
Angry scottish drunk karaoke wins soon. I was gonna do a drunk karaoke

4267
03:39:13,640 --> 03:39:18,120
On um, I don't know when yeah, I don't know when um

4268
03:39:19,320 --> 03:39:21,000
But I was gonna do it on a weekend

4269
03:39:21,000 --> 03:39:28,520
So like you guys can you know work work hard and then get all the relief on the weekend and we get steamboats and all that

4270
03:39:29,480 --> 03:39:31,480
When the talents are so

4271
03:39:32,040 --> 03:39:36,440
Jackbox would be great, but just with only one pop so you don't have to stream discord

4272
03:39:37,000 --> 03:39:39,960
Yes, I am open to doing that. Um she be

4273
03:39:40,600 --> 03:39:43,000
When we were first meeting for the first time

4274
03:39:43,080 --> 03:39:48,040
I got the girls to play a game together and we played jackbox and we all got addicted and we're like stuck

4275
03:39:48,120 --> 03:39:51,720
I was like because it was only supposed to be like a one hour icebreaker

4276
03:39:51,720 --> 03:39:55,560
So the girls could get used to like each other because like from my pov

4277
03:39:55,640 --> 03:39:59,480
I knew the girls like I had consumed their content. I knew kind of about them who they are

4278
03:39:59,880 --> 03:40:01,880
How they kind of are and all that jazz

4279
03:40:02,360 --> 03:40:06,440
Um, and then we ended up playing for like two hours and I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry

4280
03:40:06,600 --> 03:40:10,040
Like I didn't mean to steal all the time, but then like I went two hours and a half

4281
03:40:10,680 --> 03:40:11,880
um

4282
03:40:11,880 --> 03:40:17,160
In poor ac's tame zone. I picked a really bad tame zone. So she was so tired, but she was having so much fun

4283
03:40:17,240 --> 03:40:19,240
She didn't want to get off

4284
03:40:19,240 --> 03:40:21,240
Um, which was so cute

4285
03:40:21,320 --> 03:40:25,400
Then cute and good, which says cute. So if you put it dictionary

4286
03:40:26,120 --> 03:40:28,600
Oh, we we're gonna possibly do a dictionary

4287
03:40:29,240 --> 03:40:31,960
There's a new jackbox 18. That's really

4288
03:40:33,400 --> 03:40:37,480
Okay, I was gonna say I'm not sure we can hmm, but we had fun on jackbox

4289
03:40:37,880 --> 03:40:42,680
It was so mean against ac though because english isn't her first language

4290
03:40:43,240 --> 03:40:47,720
And one of the game modes was like asking all these really like hard questions

4291
03:40:47,800 --> 03:40:54,360
Like even english speakers can't get it. I felt so bad for her and she kept like dying in the game. I felt so bad

4292
03:40:55,640 --> 03:41:00,680
Um, I say not one to get off. That's definitely not true. Whoa. Did I say that sentence?

4293
03:41:02,200 --> 03:41:04,920
Deep rock galactica has a more players mod

4294
03:41:06,040 --> 03:41:08,040
Rock and stone

4295
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:11,000
Hmm

4296
03:41:11,880 --> 03:41:13,880

Would you be cool with us making not selling fan articles like daki?

4298
03:41:18,120 --> 03:41:23,080
Oh, you can do unofficial merch as long as you identify as unofficial merch

4299
03:41:23,960 --> 03:41:30,280
Fucking go wild bro. We ain't stepping on your toes and you aren't stepping on ours as long as it's unofficial merch

4300
03:41:30,280 --> 03:41:35,240
That's all you have to do unofficial merch. That's all you have to do. We don't we don't everything's good to go at that point

4301
03:41:36,200 --> 03:41:38,200

Deep rock galactica

Wholesome story time with strongy. Yes, that is uh how we all

I can't say this on youtube, but I ain't twice to you today twice

4307
03:41:58,440 --> 03:42:00,440
Over the audio

4308

Be honest refilling. Did you lose over the clapping with no hands audio is that why?

4309
03:42:06,920 --> 03:42:08,680
Any plans for

Shame

4314
03:42:29,240 --> 03:42:32,200
GTFO doesn't support six players. I don't even know what that is

4315
03:42:33,800 --> 03:42:37,160
Wow, don't be silly. You can't clap without hands

4316
03:42:37,960 --> 03:42:40,680
Can I do it right now? I might be able to do it right now. Hold on

4317
03:42:41,400 --> 03:42:43,400
Wait, let me stand up

4318
03:42:43,800 --> 03:42:45,960
I might be able to do it right now. I don't know

03:43:14,040 --> 03:43:16,040
Yeah, you doubt it

4324
03:43:18,200 --> 03:43:20,700
That's ridiculous honestly

4325
03:43:24,360 --> 03:43:29,480
Nobody can stop her honestly. It's such a great clap

4326
03:43:32,120 --> 03:43:34,760
But you doubted me I can do it all times

4327
03:43:36,360 --> 03:43:42,840
I was wrong. I'd like to formally apologize. I accept your apology reefing and also the other reeflings

Thank you for letting me do that segment just to prove you wrong

03:43:47,320 --> 03:43:48,520
Oh

03:43:48,520 --> 03:43:55,400
Been a while since I heard that one stream. Yeah, I can do it at any moment. I don't even need like oil or anything

4331
03:43:56,760 --> 03:43:58,760
I could just do it

4332
03:43:59,560 --> 03:44:01,480

4333
03:44:01,480 --> 03:44:03,960

4338
03:44:30,120 --> 03:44:32,120
um

4339
03:44:33,640 --> 03:44:38,760
Hi, strongy. Love you. Did you start v-tubing on your own or whether Schumer's that inspired you? Um

4340
03:44:40,840 --> 03:44:42,840
Inspired

4341
03:44:43,640 --> 03:44:46,760
I just I saw it and I was like, oh fuck it. I'll get it go. Um

4342
03:44:47,720 --> 03:44:50,600
And I I I've I've told this story before

4343
03:44:51,240 --> 03:44:58,600
I was very new and I could have easily been rejected for being an outsider type thing because I do a lot of things that you're not supposed to do

4344
03:44:59,160 --> 03:45:01,000
You're not supposed to

4345
03:45:01,000 --> 03:45:05,160
Acknowledge that you're pilot in America, but I'm pilot in America and I acknowledged it

4346
03:45:06,120 --> 03:45:12,920
You're supposed to know the terminology such such as zatsu or uh, tisker. Uh, well, it's not

4347
03:45:13,480 --> 03:45:15,480
Tisker, it's Tascaru

4348
03:45:16,120 --> 03:45:21,720
Uh, but I call it tisker. Um, and I could have easily have been um eaten

4349
03:45:22,600 --> 03:45:24,600
And chewed up and spat out

4350
03:45:24,680 --> 03:45:27,480
But the community was so loving towards me

4351
03:45:28,200 --> 03:45:29,720
that um

4352
03:45:29,720 --> 03:45:33,400
I kept going basically and I came back and I'm strongy

4353
03:45:33,960 --> 03:45:39,560
Hey, I've always been strongy. I've never been any other vtuber for legal reasons. Um

4354
03:45:40,680 --> 03:45:43,720
And yeah, now now it's going good. It's fantastic

4355
03:45:44,360 --> 03:45:49,560
Um, I did like iron mouse because she's sick as a dog. Um, but

4356
03:45:50,440 --> 03:45:53,080
Like keep streaming anyway. Uh, definitely

4357
03:45:54,040 --> 03:46:00,040
You can always kind of lend some energy when you hear stories about like people against all odds

4358
03:46:00,040 --> 03:46:04,040
Like you know, you got the energy to keep up and keep going type type thing. Um

4359
03:46:05,320 --> 03:46:06,520
Where's

4360
03:46:06,520 --> 03:46:07,560
my

4361
03:46:07,560 --> 03:46:09,560
Time in the robot mark

4362
03:46:10,440 --> 03:46:13,000
I keep saying it like tisker

4363
03:46:15,080 --> 03:46:17,080
Like a noise you make when dying

4364
03:46:18,520 --> 03:46:20,520
Noise that make when I die

4365
03:46:22,840 --> 03:46:24,440
Uh

4366
03:46:24,440 --> 03:46:29,640
Oh when's my time in the robot? Oh, no, I'm a mecca. I pilot a mecca like mecca salt

4367
03:46:31,000 --> 03:46:34,040
The hit video game from xbox original

4368
03:46:36,920 --> 03:46:38,600
Um

4369
03:46:38,600 --> 03:46:39,960
But yeah

4370
03:46:39,960 --> 03:46:43,400
That my that my mecca story. I do a lot of things. You're not supposed to do

4371
03:46:44,200 --> 03:46:50,920
Hey, I'm not supposed to say. Oh, I'm recalibrating my tracking. Uh, I'm putting on my my little face emotes

4372
03:46:52,120 --> 03:46:53,160
Yeah

4373
03:46:53,160 --> 03:46:58,680
Yeah, I'm not supposed to do that. Hold on a minute. Uh, but yeah, I do it anyway because I'm naughty

4374
03:46:59,160 --> 03:47:01,400
I'm getting the robot strongy

4375
03:47:02,200 --> 03:47:06,360
Getting the mecca. Oh, I'm gonna burp. I'm so sorry. Please open your mouth. Okay. There we go

4376
03:47:07,080 --> 03:47:09,080
Well, swallow it

4377
03:47:09,400 --> 03:47:11,400
good reefing

4378
03:47:12,520 --> 03:47:21,400
In regards to hypnosis audios, are you gonna make reinforcement audios for triggers and for audio loops for triggers and affirmations?

4379
03:47:22,120 --> 03:47:24,120
um

4380
03:47:24,120 --> 03:47:28,120
You're gonna have to let me start digesting producing it first before I can answer these kind of questions

4381
03:47:28,920 --> 03:47:33,240
I'm staying away from the permanent stuff because it makes me a bit nervous doing any permanent effects stuff

4382
03:47:33,320 --> 03:47:36,200
But I already have a public release audio

4383
03:47:36,760 --> 03:47:43,080
That will undo any effects. I may or may not do on you. What did you ask me in particular reinforcement loop for triggers?

4384
03:47:43,800 --> 03:47:45,400
for triggers

4385
03:47:45,400 --> 03:47:51,720
Mine's double finger snaps. Uh, I like it. Um, the most but I will train you in it. Okay

4386
03:47:52,360 --> 03:47:53,720
I

4387
03:47:53,720 --> 03:48:01,720
Embarrassed I'm embarrassed to admit by inked to your clapping with no hands and the party roleplay. Oh, yeah, you like that

4388
03:48:02,680 --> 03:48:07,720
It was really hot. I'm glad you like that. I put a little put a little bit of my heart into that

4389
03:48:07,720 --> 03:48:09,720
I like that. Okay. I'll enjoy how it came out

4390
03:48:11,320 --> 03:48:13,320
um

4391
03:48:14,680 --> 03:48:16,680
Hi, strongy. How do you feel about male?

4392
03:48:17,320 --> 03:48:21,400
Figurines being used in bibbute videos. Yeah, you can do that

4393
03:48:23,720 --> 03:48:25,320
um

4394
03:48:25,320 --> 03:48:26,840
but maybe

4395
03:48:26,840 --> 03:48:28,840
Maybe in the future you can use

4396
03:48:29,800 --> 03:48:31,800
official veiler merch association

4397
03:48:33,640 --> 03:48:35,640
Figurines

4398
03:48:36,600 --> 03:48:38,600
Ah

4399
03:48:39,160 --> 03:48:43,720
That's not something I need to fixation. Oh, I got five at 10. I got seven. I got nine at 10

4400
03:48:44,520 --> 03:48:48,600
I like the transparency though because you're just a normal person at the end of the day

4401
03:48:48,920 --> 03:48:53,960
Yeah, actually, can I say something that's really disrespectful and I mean no disrespect when I say it

4402
03:48:54,600 --> 03:49:01,960
You know those v-tubers that have those donations where like items get thrown at the v-tuber model when they get a donation

4403
03:49:02,520 --> 03:49:04,520
and then the v-tuber goes like

4404
03:49:07,240 --> 03:49:10,280
The the every time I consume any of that

4405
03:49:11,240 --> 03:49:14,600
I this is very disrespectful and I don't mean it this way

4406
03:49:14,680 --> 03:49:17,640
It makes me cringe to think that they're in a room

4407
03:49:18,280 --> 03:49:21,880
On their own with the iphone tracking them and going

4408
03:49:25,320 --> 03:49:27,000
I'm so sorry

4409
03:49:27,000 --> 03:49:29,000
I'm like actually so sorry

4410
03:49:29,480 --> 03:49:30,600
for me

4411
03:49:30,600 --> 03:49:31,960
for me

4412
03:49:31,960 --> 03:49:33,080
It's a no

4413
03:49:33,080 --> 03:49:38,680
But people find it entertaining which is really cute. I like that people can get so entertained and so

4414
03:49:39,480 --> 03:49:41,480
Enveloped

4415
03:49:41,720 --> 03:49:45,400
That it's humorous. So I do apologize to anyone that I may have

4416
03:49:46,200 --> 03:49:48,200
Uh, thank you. Yeah, I've seen it too

4417
03:49:49,560 --> 03:49:52,440
Twitch integrated throwing system. Oh, okay. Is that what it's called?

4418
03:49:53,400 --> 03:49:58,200
And yeah, and here you are velour figures that well adjusted people can be normal

4419
03:50:00,200 --> 03:50:05,240
Don't think about it harder. It makes the cringe. Yeah, I remember seeing a clip about it and I was like

4420
03:50:05,880 --> 03:50:09,800
Don't get me wrong. I'm a cringe fest if you sit through one stream of mine

4421
03:50:10,600 --> 03:50:17,000
But I remember seeing it and I was like, oh, that's rough. That's rough even for me to digest

4422
03:50:18,600 --> 03:50:23,000
But I mean absolutely no disrespect when I say that like whatever works for you works for you

4423
03:50:23,560 --> 03:50:25,240
some people are

4424
03:50:25,240 --> 03:50:28,280
Balls to the wall in immersion and that's fantastic

4425
03:50:28,840 --> 03:50:33,880
For me, um, I am absolutely in love that reeflings are in love with pilot in America

4426
03:50:34,200 --> 03:50:36,200
It makes me incredibly comfortable

4427
03:50:36,680 --> 03:50:38,120
I'm

4428
03:50:38,120 --> 03:50:43,000
Like streaming and acknowledging like oh, I need to only go put my emotes on

4429
03:50:43,640 --> 03:50:45,640
Instead of like being like

4430
03:50:45,640 --> 03:50:47,640
I love you so much

4431
03:50:48,840 --> 03:50:49,800
Like

4432
03:50:49,800 --> 03:50:55,400
Bro, ain't no one here for that. Well, some people might be here for that but me. I'm not here for that, you know

4433
03:50:57,000 --> 03:50:59,000
Um

4434
03:50:59,960 --> 03:51:02,120
Yeah, it's basically just beautiful

4435
03:51:02,760 --> 03:51:07,800
But I don't mind like the roleplay like if I had a 3d model or I'll be roleplaying at the wazoo

4436
03:51:07,880 --> 03:51:13,320
So I'm probably gonna be hypocritical with that statement. It's not even a statement. It's just me blabbering

4437
03:51:13,880 --> 03:51:19,240
Any blabberers the heart eyes. Yeah, I love that my heart eyes are so different

4438
03:51:19,400 --> 03:51:25,000
Like, oh my god, my squiddles. Where'd my squiddly pupils go? Give me my squiddly pupils back

4439
03:51:29,720 --> 03:51:31,720
Oh

4440
03:51:34,760 --> 03:51:38,840
Wait, hold on you ready for this you ready for this. Oh wait, no wrong one

4441
03:51:41,640 --> 03:51:44,280
Me when there's no when there's no special honey tea

4442
03:51:46,440 --> 03:51:48,440
Oh

4443
03:51:49,080 --> 03:51:51,080
Wow

4444
03:51:53,320 --> 03:51:57,160
Me when me when there's actually a refractory period, I can't believe it

4445
03:51:59,000 --> 03:52:04,760
Any merch you'd like to have made in the future even if it ain't the the typical merch for me

4446
03:52:05,400 --> 03:52:07,400
or for the girls

4447
03:52:07,800 --> 03:52:14,280
Um a bash bite. Uh, I'm gonna try and get as a bash bite. Um, I'm not even pretending otherwise. Um

4448
03:52:15,400 --> 03:52:16,840
Hi, story any

4449
03:52:16,840 --> 03:52:22,680
Plans for age of empire 3 or age of mythology curious. I would have to look at it the current game

4450
03:52:22,760 --> 03:52:28,280
I'm investigating that I'm not familiar with right now is baltrol. Um, it looks pretty decent. It looks

4451
03:52:29,240 --> 03:52:31,480
Well, well rounded well adjusted game. Um

4452
03:52:32,200 --> 03:52:37,240
And I just need to kind of learn what the heck are flushes and all of that. We're brewing the tea. Give us a minute

4453
03:52:38,440 --> 03:52:42,680
Honestly refunds like oh, bro. Give us a minute woman. Jesus

4454
03:52:44,120 --> 03:52:45,880
um

4455
03:52:45,880 --> 03:52:48,600
But yes, I'm currently doing baltrol age of empires

4456
03:52:48,600 --> 03:52:49,960
I could look into

4457
03:52:49,960 --> 03:52:52,360
Is that that game where you can like have a king

4458
03:52:52,920 --> 03:52:58,040
But like a lineage of the region or something. I might have seen some gameplay of it

4459
03:52:58,280 --> 03:53:00,280
That's what I'm thinking

4460
03:53:00,280 --> 03:53:04,840
Strongly we love you no matter what make are you pilot? Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you

4461
03:53:06,520 --> 03:53:11,720
I said see you on my fifth persona in five years time. I wonder what I'll look like then. Well, I'll have double bunches

4462
03:53:11,880 --> 03:53:13,800
Let's let's find out

4463
03:53:13,800 --> 03:53:17,880
Any hints for a one-on-one collab and be alert. Yeah yesterday. Um

4464
03:53:18,680 --> 03:53:21,560
Me and mersey honk honk honk honk honk

4465
03:53:23,640 --> 03:53:25,640
Me and mersey

4466
03:53:26,600 --> 03:53:33,000
Uh, I love you very much and have for a very long time. Oh, let me tell you fling. Thank you for waiting on me

4467
03:53:33,320 --> 03:53:37,480
It took me a while, but sam wise the brave one didn't

4468
03:53:40,040 --> 03:53:43,480
One time the homies tried to play age of empires three with me

4469
03:53:45,720 --> 03:53:51,400
They made an asmr is off. Oh wait, you can make asmr is the age of empires. Huh?

4470
03:53:52,360 --> 03:53:54,920
Boutro is my current a obsession

4471
03:53:56,040 --> 03:53:58,680
Boutro is an occult that ballah paddle

4472
03:54:00,760 --> 03:54:03,480
The spirit is willing but the body is weary and sore

4473
03:54:05,320 --> 03:54:10,040
Not a third persona play. No, no, no, I don't worry. I can't be yours. I can't I'm done in after this

4474
03:54:10,120 --> 03:54:12,120
I'm strong in and I'm done

4475
03:54:13,720 --> 03:54:15,320
I'll happily

4476
03:54:15,320 --> 03:54:16,520
retire

4477
03:54:16,600 --> 03:54:21,480
Many and many years don't stop doing in many years. I'll happily retire and I'll just be like some sort of fucking

4478
03:54:21,720 --> 03:54:23,880
Vtuber runner advisor type thing

4479
03:54:24,920 --> 03:54:29,320
Uh, once all the viola girls are happy and doing their thing

4480
03:54:30,600 --> 03:54:31,960
but

4481
03:54:31,960 --> 03:54:33,000
Hi

4482
03:54:33,000 --> 03:54:37,400
strongy your patreon ASMR has been so good. I've been going back to them every night and inking

4483
03:54:38,600 --> 03:54:40,600
Yeah

4484
03:54:40,600 --> 03:54:42,600
You like the vanilla demo

4485
03:54:43,640 --> 03:54:45,640
Oh reef fling you're so cold

4486
03:54:46,840 --> 03:54:48,840
But I'm Scottish so I can warm you up

4487
03:54:50,200 --> 03:54:54,840
Don't you want to be warmed up? Hmm. Your protein equals getting cold too

4488
03:55:00,440 --> 03:55:06,680
Terrible don't retire. No, I can't be yours retiring. I've got too many plans. I'm sorry

4489
03:55:07,160 --> 03:55:12,040
But as we say to death not today, I have far too many plans to

4490
03:55:12,760 --> 03:55:14,760
Um

4491
03:55:15,240 --> 03:55:18,520
Execute before strongy gets executed

4492
03:55:20,360 --> 03:55:25,080
Uh, I have far too many plans. Sorry. I've put too much love and soul into

4493
03:55:26,040 --> 03:55:29,720
strongy and the viola girls that uh, yeah, I've got many a year in me

4494
03:55:29,720 --> 03:55:30,920
I assure you

4495
03:55:30,920 --> 03:55:35,560
Emmy is live and T-minus three minutes. Okay. Okay. Let's bash one out right now

4496
03:55:37,800 --> 03:55:41,320
That's terrible. I probably could if I tried hard enough

4497
03:55:41,720 --> 03:55:43,720
um

4498
03:55:43,880 --> 03:55:45,880
Yeah

4499
03:55:46,600 --> 03:55:49,640
As someone who's been into bit no kink for a while now, I

4500
03:55:50,680 --> 03:55:56,840
Particularly enjoy finger snapping too. Yes. I do double finger snap to get you under. It's my favorite

4501
03:55:56,920 --> 03:56:02,600
I love double finger snap your binaural. That's the word not your ear binaural finger snap

4502
03:56:02,600 --> 03:56:07,240
I know you can't hear it because I'm using a mono microphone right now, but I like binaural

4503
03:56:08,200 --> 03:56:13,080
I'm very much into a fraction nation fractionation obviously set the wrong

4504
03:56:14,360 --> 03:56:17,320
The practice has been put under and then brought up and

4505
03:56:18,040 --> 03:56:21,720
Uh, oh, that would be that would be a nice challenge. That would be a nice challenge

4506
03:56:23,160 --> 03:56:26,920
Your video of asking to hold it has been weirdly comforting while coding

4507
03:56:27,320 --> 03:56:32,120
Oh, do you like when I completely lose it at the end of the video and I'm just like, please

4508
03:56:34,200 --> 03:56:36,600
Like absolutely losing it at the end of the video

4509
03:56:37,240 --> 03:56:41,800
I'm glad it can be a comfort. I might have an official 1k celebration

4510
03:56:42,360 --> 03:56:46,680
ASMR coming out today because I got it halfway finished editing

4511
03:56:46,840 --> 03:56:50,200
But I need to finish edit in the other half and then I need to render it out

4512
03:56:50,600 --> 03:56:57,240
Um, and then we'll take it from there because I owe you guys five videos

4513
03:56:58,200 --> 03:57:01,800
And at the rate my channel is growing I can't keep up

4514
03:57:02,120 --> 03:57:06,360
And I have these ASMR collabs with all these lovely girls

4515
03:57:06,360 --> 03:57:09,160
Per Dempuz been waiting on me to record my lines

4516
03:57:09,800 --> 03:57:11,240
um

4517
03:57:11,240 --> 03:57:12,920
and I also have a

4518
03:57:12,920 --> 03:57:14,920
collab with uh

4519
03:57:15,560 --> 03:57:17,560
Freya and

4520
03:57:17,640 --> 03:57:19,640
Mimosa

4521
03:57:19,880 --> 03:57:21,880
The collab list gets pretty long

4522
03:57:23,080 --> 03:57:27,560
Actually, there's another yumi plus groba as a three-deal that I need to write our collab with

4523
03:57:27,800 --> 03:57:35,320
Wow suffering from success. Yeah, you do. Okay, Mimosa. Yeah, I was like Mimosa's waiting on me

4524
03:57:35,800 --> 03:57:39,960
I need to edit our one and you said it quite a few let her cook. Yeah

4525
03:57:41,240 --> 03:57:49,080
She calling you out. I know I know I need to get it edited and slapped up because Mimosa actually gave me her png for it already

4526
03:57:49,400 --> 03:57:50,520
um

4527
03:57:50,520 --> 03:57:54,280
So I just need to record my audio put it together

4528
03:57:54,440 --> 03:57:59,000
Um, and then put us both in our lovely little thumbnail and then I'll add Mimosa in the title

4529
03:57:59,320 --> 03:58:04,120
And then you guys can discover Mimosa. Um, she's been nothing but a delight. Uh, and she completely

4530
03:58:04,920 --> 03:58:09,160
I am like 100 completely comfortable with Mimosa and I've only known her for a week
