0	16000	Hey, I was over for you before we even got started.
16000	28000	Hello, are you there?
28000	35000	Can you hear this little call of it?
35000	46000	Hello, my mouth is wiggling because I didn't put my lid on.
46000	50000	I'm cooking, I'm cooking.
50000	54000	So professional, so professional.
54000	57000	My cats are currently play-fighting.
57000	63000	So if you hear my cats play-fighting, it's going to be terrible.
63000	69000	I made the mistake of giving my cats what's called a licky lick.
69000	73000	Wait, I spelled permanent wrong.
73000	75000	I'm not dead.
75000	80000	So if you're bumping about, my cats are going to absolutely wail.
80000	83000	Hi.
83000	90000	Now today is a very short stream.
90000	97000	But I should really sound like this for you.
97000	100000	Good morning.
100000	104000	Good evening.
104000	112000	And good afternoon.
112000	116000	I have lots of fun things to try.
116000	126000	I need to make myself louder or lower the background sound.
126000	133000	Now I just want to say I'm not doing any permanent effects.
133000	140000	So don't worry, you're in good condition.
140000	151000	I will look after you as I hear my cat bumping against my door.
151000	155000	Hi.
155000	159000	Now I spelled permanent but it remained in it.
159000	163000	Now you all know.
163000	169000	Make it permanent.
169000	179000	Have to miss this stream, it's okay.
179000	186000	We're going nice and slow.
186000	197000	I don't normally use these eyes but I can't help it.
197000	206000	It was always permanent.
206000	213000	I can now hear my cat run behind my couch.
213000	221000	Oh, there she goes.
221000	225000	Oh, and she's...
225000	233000	Okay, I think she's just jumped on the cardboard box now.
233000	237000	So take your time to relax.
237000	251000	I think she's beaten up V-core right now.
251000	257000	Of course, she's been so good.
257000	262000	I think she's beaten up V-core right now.
262000	268000	But it's okay.
268000	280000	So slowly, you can feel yourself starting to drift.
280000	284000	And that's okay.
284000	288000	Like that feeling, come over here.
288000	294000	No reflex, don't let go.
294000	304000	Oh no, is this ear broken?
304000	307000	Is this ear broken? Is this ear broken? Hello?
307000	311000	Oh my gosh, wait, why is one ear stronger than the other?
311000	312000	Both ears work.
312000	316000	Oh, okay, I just said right into your ear that.
316000	321000	Oopsies, sorry, I just whispered right into your ear.
321000	327000	The ear works, but as less equal, why would that be?
327000	330000	If anything, can't go.
330000	338000	I don't know why, because my focus rate isn't equal.
338000	341000	Such a professional stream there.
341000	345000	No, I should say correct.
345000	348000	It's okay if it's weaker.
348000	355000	I like them weak.
355000	366000	The bass part, hello.
366000	376000	Let this cobalt fish lure you to the depths.
376000	387000	For no particular reason at all.
387000	396000	Oh, sorry, I did it twice, I had to make twice.
396000	409000	I'm just gonna brush over your ears to give you the feeling of a false security,
409000	417000	as I'm sure I'm not planning anything else at all.
417000	428000	Not one single thing.
428000	434000	We get to go down into the depths together.
434000	449000	Just me, and you, and my voice, and you listening in.
449000	460000	Yeah, gently, brushing over your ears.
460000	469000	And some cats, okay, maybe the caster.
469000	475000	Wow.
475000	484000	Gentle, gentle movements.
484000	493000	I have some good news for my reflinks.
493000	502000	My YouTube channel has been submitted for monetizing.
502000	506000	Oh, the heat just came on.
506000	511000	I need to go turn the heat off, I'm so sorry.
511000	540000	I'm so professional, let's go.
540000	551000	Come on, it was me, I won't get all lost, being professional, it's me.
551000	558000	When can I start being myself, or do I need to keep being professional?
558000	564000	The cat turned the heat on, because it wants attention.
564000	574000	Okay, give me five more minutes and I'll be serious, okay?
574000	590000	The noise is encapsulating you.
590000	604000	And you feel behind a sense of belonging.
604000	617000	You could even think to yourself, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
617000	638000	If I gave up control, control to one particular girl, and it wouldn't be so bad.
638000	645000	What's the worst that could happen from this little gullfish?
645000	647000	Is there a cat in my room?
647000	648000	No.
648000	653000	Okay, I literally thought Gimli sneaked in there.
653000	667000	As I'm saying control yet, surely this gullfish means no harm.
667000	685000	And even if it was for 24 hours, one day, one day, how much harm could you really be
685000	699000	under, or could be done in 24 little hours?
699000	703000	No more harm at all.
703000	708000	So slowly your mind wanders.
708000	717000	What would this gullfish ask me to do?
717000	725000	Only a few things, my dear refling.
725000	734000	But some things can't be said, only guessed.
734000	750000	You have to go into deeper parts of your mind to know and realize what this gullfish wants.
750000	773000	And maybe my dear refling, you realize I want complete and total control of you.
773000	778000	Would that be so bad?
778000	783000	No.
783000	802000	So maybe that 24 hours becomes 48, and then 48 becomes 72.
802000	814000	And before you know it, this gullfish has had a week of you.
814000	842000	Then two weeks, a month, or maybe just maybe this gullfish made breaks you.
842000	852000	That's just my things that I want.
852000	858000	But you have to earn the things you want.
858000	862000	So I need to bathe, don't I?
862000	868000	I need to do the right things.
868000	876000	So you're encapsulated by me, yeah?
876000	886000	So how about just for now, I'll be a good girl for you.
886000	897000	And maybe, just maybe, you'll be a very good boy for me.
897000	903000	Does that sound like a plan, my dear refling?
903000	906000	Yeah.
906000	918000	Let's see how much we can bathe together.
918000	933000	Let's be on our best behavior then.
933000	940000	I'll tell you a way that I can be good for you.
940000	952000	I'll allow you, refling, to type sentences you want me to say in chat right now.
952000	966000	And I just might go from ear to ear and gain more favor from you as I say what you want to hear.
966000	970000	Does that sound like a plan?
970000	974000	Because I'd love to do that for you.
974000	981000	Gain your favor, huh?
981000	987000	Zepai means couple fish in Italian.
987000	991000	Hi, honey.
991000	997000	All hail the ref.
997000	1003000	You're such a playful little thing, aren't ya?
1003000	1010000	That's why we have such fun together, isn't it, refling?
1011000	1019000	I love you, refling.
1019000	1023000	I'm proud of you.
1023000	1031000	I'm proud of us.
1031000	1041000	And I'm totally not hypnotizing you right now.
1041000	1049000	Oh, you're not gonna be a loser, are you, refling?
1049000	1052000	You're not gonna lose to me.
1052000	1057000	Don't tell me this is enough to put you under my spell.
1057000	1061000	You have to make me work for it, refling.
1061000	1067000	You do less work really, really hard.
1074000	1077000	Here we go.
1077000	1081000	You can look in my eyes.
1081000	1086000	Just done the spiral.
1088000	1095000	Dear...
1102000	1106000	Do you like looking into my eyes?
1106000	1111000	I think they're rather tantalizing, don't ya?
1112000	1119000	I can make my eyes open wide like this.
1119000	1123000	Staring right at you.
1123000	1126000	I see you.
1126000	1129000	And you see me.
1129000	1135000	And you see everything I'm doing to you.
1135000	1140000	Right at this very second.
1140000	1143000	It's okay.
1143000	1147000	You can blink.
1147000	1152000	But don't look away for too long.
1152000	1158000	Remember, we have to behave for one another.
1158000	1169000	Do you like that?
1169000	1179000	I'll just tap on your ears gently, gently, gently, gently.
1179000	1183000	You're more welcome.
1183000	1196000	You're more than welcome to blink and sink.
1196000	1199000	I quite like that phrase.
1199000	1203000	Blink and sink.
1203000	1215000	It's okay if your body starts to feel a bit weaker.
1215000	1220000	And if your mind starts to wander.
1220000	1223000	That's okay.
1223000	1227000	You may even say little refling.
1227000	1230000	That's by design.
1230000	1235000	Yeah.
1235000	1238000	I don't know.
1238000	1244000	There's just something about you being a bit tired around me.
1244000	1249000	Maybe you don't want to fade back.
1249000	1255000	Not like you could by the time I'm done with you.
1261000	1265000	My little refling.
1265000	1271000	Why don't you come a little bit closer?
1271000	1275000	I promise I won't pay.
1275000	1277000	No.
1277000	1286000	In fact, you may blink what you faint.
1287000	1302000	As you go deeper and deeper with me.
1302000	1311000	Deeper and deeper, your thoughts are turning to confusion.
1311000	1314000	What did you say?
1314000	1321000	With only my voice remaining in your head.
1321000	1333000	You don't have to focus on a single thing other than what this alluring cuttlefish is seeing.
1333000	1338000	There, there.
1338000	1345000	Just look at me and forget.
1345000	1357000	All you need to know, refling, is that you're safe and you're in good hands with me.
1357000	1363000	And by the time I'm finished with you,
1363000	1370000	you'll already want to be going under again.
1370000	1374000	But little refling.
1374000	1380000	I'll give you a tingle break, okay?
1380000	1384000	I'll say more phrases shortly.
1384000	1388000	But have a little break, break, break, break.
1388000	1393000	We need to take things slow.
1393000	1406000	Think of it as an introduction to your induction.
1406000	1411000	But please don't worry.
1411000	1418000	There will be no permanent effects in this dream.
1418000	1426000	So you are welcome to go as deep as you like with me.
1426000	1429000	Yeah.
1429000	1440000	Although I do admit this good girl likes it when you go deep.
1440000	1447000	Yeah.
1447000	1454000	Thank you for the deep little refling.
1454000	1462000	You like when I do ASMR streams on you, huh?
1462000	1475000	Oh, I had plenty of time to think of how I could truly mean to break you.
1475000	1482000	This is one of many, okay?
1482000	1491000	So to those who may be resistant, that's okay.
1491000	1494000	Because I'm coming for you.
1494000	1498000	Do you understand?
1498000	1501000	I will get you.
1501000	1504000	That is my goal.
1504000	1511000	And have I failed any of my goals so far?
1511000	1515000	No little refling.
1515000	1520000	So heed my warning.
1520000	1536000	I am coming.
1536000	1543000	Yeah.
1543000	1547000	Relax.
1547000	1555000	If you think my words are waking you up,
1555000	1565000	they should be slowly bringing you down.
1565000	1572000	Down, down, down, okay?
1572000	1577000	That's why we need a little timer.
1577000	1581000	Where we just listen in.
1581000	1590000	And whatever our brain and body decides will do.
1590000	1598000	But that doesn't mean this cuttlefish can suggest a few things to you.
1598000	1604000	Yeah.
1604000	1614000	Hey.
1614000	1623000	Just let whatever happens happen.
1623000	1632000	I won't be bidding you purposefully in a trance, okay?
1632000	1640000	But if you just happen to be so well-drained,
1640000	1644000	I welcome it entirely.
1644000	1654000	I welcome my voice and encapsulating your mind.
1654000	1661000	I welcome your full attention.
1661000	1674000	So be good, little refling, and don't keep me waiting.
1674000	1681000	Yeah.
1681000	1687000	You might feel it starting from your head
1687000	1695000	and slowly a sensation radiates downwards
1695000	1702000	down to your neck, then your shoulders.
1702000	1707000	And that sensation splits off.
1707000	1714000	It splits going down your arms and chest at the same time.
1714000	1726000	Slowly, slowly, slowly radiating its way through your body.
1726000	1731000	Turn your stomach.
1731000	1737000	Down, down, down.
1737000	1742000	And past your hips.
1742000	1748000	It's already gone through your fingertips at this point.
1748000	1757000	And down your legs, your thighs, your calves, your feet.
1757000	1766000	Until that sensation is all over.
1766000	1771000	There's nothing you can do about it, but that's okay.
1771000	1777000	Because the sensation is pleasant.
1777000	1780000	It's warm.
1780000	1784000	It feels comforting.
1784000	1790000	It's hard for you to describe, but that's okay.
1790000	1797000	I will do the talking for the both of us.
1797000	1810000	That sensation is you possibly entering a trance, and that's okay.
1810000	1814000	It's nice when I'm in control.
1814000	1824000	It's nice when you let me in control.
1828000	1834000	Enjoy the feeling, okay?
1834000	1838000	Enjoy the sensation.
1838000	1843000	We're both doing it together, aren't we?
1843000	1846000	Yeah.
1846000	1849000	Yeah.
1849000	1853000	Good.
1853000	1856000	For you.
1856000	1860000	Are your limbs feeling heavy?
1860000	1866000	It's okay, little reef like, that's just a side effect.
1866000	1872000	But over time, you'll make enjoy it.
1872000	1880000	Because when your limbs feel heavy, that's when you know, that's when you know this kind of fish.
1880000	1886000	As in control.
1886000	1894000	And I'll keep you safe when you're with me, okay?
1894000	1900000	Okay, little reef like.
1900000	1905000	For you.
1905000	1912000	For you, little reef like.
1912000	1918000	This is all by your choice.
1918000	1925000	Although you might be too deep, should I bring you back up?
1925000	1934000	Or are you strong enough to give me some phrases you want to hear?
1934000	1941000	Do you think you could do that for me, little reef like?
1941000	1957000	You tell me what you want to hear, and this kind of fish will be, will both be good for each other.
1957000	1966000	Because I'm ready to obey you.
1966000	1971000	You're doing such a good job.
1971000	1979000	I'm so proud of how far you've come, little reef like.
1979000	1984000	Back and forth.
1984000	1992000	Ear to ear.
1992000	1996000	Yeah.
1996000	2009000	You did good today.
2009000	2014000	And I can see how hard you're working.
2014000	2018000	Well done, little reef like.
2018000	2021000	Well done.
2021000	2028000	You're a good boy, and I'm a good girl.
2028000	2036000	Together we'll have lots of fun.
2036000	2041000	Just surrender and let me take control.
2041000	2047000	My little reef like.
2047000	2052000	I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.
2052000	2055000	You always do.
2055000	2058000	Don't ya?
2058000	2062000	And I'm sure you'll make it through.
2062000	2066000	It's hard right now, but you'll make it through.
2066000	2068000	You always do.
2068000	2071000	Don't ya?
2071000	2079000	And I'll be there on the other side, cheering you on.
2079000	2094000	Oh, my little reef like, would you kindly be a good little boy for mommy?
2094000	2101000	Oh, you're so heavy and so deep.
2101000	2108000	And so happy to give yourself to me.
2109000	2115000	Resistance is futile at this point.
2115000	2119000	Just give in, give up.
2119000	2127000	My strength is unrelenting, my stamina unending.
2127000	2133000	One way or another, you are main.
2133000	2136000	Core.
2143000	2145000	Okay.
2145000	2150000	Let's relax, relax, relax, relax.
2150000	2153000	There we go.
2153000	2156000	I'll bring you back up a little.
2156000	2160000	I don't want you guys to get so deep now.
2160000	2169000	This was supposed to be a very gentle and secret induction.
2169000	2173000	I'll do some more little tingles.
2177000	2181000	Oh, my reeflings.
2181000	2185000	I don't know if I should bring you back up,
2185000	2193000	or if I should leave you in the trance if you're in one then.
2193000	2199000	You want to go a little deeper?
2199000	2204000	I need to be gentle with you, though.
2204000	2206000	Don't you see?
2206000	2217000	I've had so much time to think of how hard I was going to...
2217000	2221000	What's the word, eh?
2221000	2225000	How hard I was going to go on you.
2225000	2230000	And I need to be able to not break you.
2230000	2235000	I don't want to break you, no more.
2235000	2240000	I want to mate, break you.
2240000	2245000	But that takes time.
2245000	2251000	We just need to spend a little more time together.
2251000	2257000	My stomach is making noises, I root.
2257000	2264000	If you bring us back up, it makes dropping back down even better.
2264000	2269000	Please, oh.
2269000	2274000	For you guys.
2274000	2286000	Yeah, just relax and let loose all of this burden.
2286000	2294000	Because when you're under, I'll be supporting you.
2294000	2304000	And I'll caress all over you, look after you.
2304000	2308000	I can only say the rest of it.
2308000	2314000	Over reeflings.
2315000	2323000	Okay, I'm going to slowly bring you back again.
2323000	2330000	And just take your time, slowly.
2330000	2335000	You can feel yourself come up.
2335000	2341000	That heavy feeling that's all over your body
2341000	2346000	is lifting slowly.
2346000	2351000	Reversing from the path it once took.
2351000	2358000	From your feet to your calves and thighs.
2358000	2364000	Your thoughts are becoming their own again.
2364000	2373000	That sensation coming back up, up, up your body.
2373000	2382000	Past your hips, your stomach, your chest.
2382000	2394000	Your fingertips, your hands to your elbows, your shoulders slowly up, up, up.
2394000	2406000	Until that sensation goes back to your collar, your neck, your head.
2406000	2414000	Until you're here again, little reefling.
2414000	2419000	Welcome back to the land of the living.
2419000	2426000	Hi, reefling. Did you have fun?
2426000	2430000	Yeah, good morning.
2430000	2434000	Good morning, little reefling.
2434000	2438000	That's my tracking every such a silly day. Hold on.
2438000	2441000	You need to calibrate.
2441000	2444000	Wow, calibration complete.
2444000	2446000	Johnny returns.
2446000	2449000	The meme lord herself.
2449000	2451000	My cup of tea got cold.
2451000	2455000	I got really into that. I'm sorry, I really got into that.
2455000	2461000	But my cup of tea is cold, so I can't have my cup of tea.
2461000	2470000	Good morning, little reefling, or afternoon, or evening, or good time zone.
2470000	2479000	Oh, let me, uh, this is more me, I think. Yeah, yeah, this is more me.
2479000	2484000	Microwave the tea, reefling, don't be so silly.
2484000	2488000	Special thank you again to Anonymous for the tip.
2488000	2492000	Anonymous said, holy moly, this ace of art stream is so good.
2492000	2495000	Thank you very much. Yeah, that was my true heart in.
2495000	2498000	But now you've got the meme lord me.
2498000	2500000	Get wrecked.
2500000	2505000	It's very unlikely I will pull that off again in this stream,
2505000	2511000	because I am fricking rubbish at being fricking, uh, what's the word?
2511000	2516000	Serious. Yeah, I should probably, uh, maybe we just, uh, camera thing.
2516000	2522000	Hi, it's me. I'll leave the background, it's quite soothing, but it's me again. Hi.
2522000	2526000	I reefling.
2526000	2531000	That cramp lunch box, that's right, get knocked on. Yeah.
2531000	2538000	Are you enjoying Aces? Oh, Anonymous. I can't say Brian.
2538000	2546000	Ah, thank you for the tip, Anonymous. Anonymous is trying to cute. Yeah, we cute up in her.
2546000	2553000	Gremlin's back, oh baby, so don't be expecting any serious to come out of my mouth for the rest of this stream.
2553000	2558000	Like, if you're here, if you're here for the, that section we just did, sorry.
2558000	2565000	The meme-er, the meme-er is back, okay? My voice is right from RuneScape yesterday.
2565000	2573000	But I do plan on doing weekly ASMR streams, which is why I do say please like and subscribe for more.
2573000	2582000	Uh, the fantastic news, my little reeflings, the fantastic news is my channel is being submitted for monetization,
2582000	2590000	which means I can finally start uploading my ASMR videos for my 1000, so thank you.
2590000	2596000	I'm already on 4000 subscribers, which is amazing, which means I owe you, yes you, listening in.
2596000	2601000	That's right, this streamer owes you content.
2601000	2606000	So I have four ASMR videos getting ready.
2606000	2611000	So we've submitted my channel to YouTube, and I'm sure they're gonna really like that.
2611000	2614000	James Cameron's avatar stream, yeah.
2614000	2618000	When I absolutely raged.
2618000	2624000	But yeah, the meme-er is back, don't be expecting anything, but how good does this ASMR sound?
2624000	2627000	So how good does this?
2627000	2630000	Oh, I should maybe take off the hypno background.
2630000	2633000	Now you get to hear my stomach even more.
2633000	2635000	Thank you for the tip.
2635000	2638000	Oh, Irfan Piscotti, thank you for the tips.
2638000	2641000	Thank you, Momay, very nice and relaxing.
2641000	2643000	I've got you, like, down there.
2643000	2646000	Though returning to Kremlin mode is good too, yeah.
2646000	2648000	That's more like me.
2648000	2650000	Best of luck on monetization.
2650000	2660000	Thank you for the tip, and yes, um, for that kind of thing, I'm most likely gonna be doing free content on Twitter.
2661000	2664000	Milk Cadmus, thank you for the tip.
2664000	2666000	That was amazing.
2666000	2671000	Please, for the love of all, that is strongly keeping our cut by all of this posted.
2671000	2674000	I never did anything wrong in this stream.
2676000	2679000	I have done everything correct.
2679000	2684000	But this, this is a sensory toy, and it's my favorite ASMR trigger right now.
2684000	2686000	Listen to it.
2690000	2692000	Isn't that amazing?
2692000	2695000	Thank you so much for that tip, Milk Cadmus.
2695000	2698000	But yeah, I didn't do anything wrong this stream.
2700000	2707000	But if you didn't know, AC Snowballs is live right now doing a DJ session.
2707000	2714000	So if you're needing this to be a bit more, if you're needing a bit more hype for your stream,
2715000	2718000	definitely check her out.
2718000	2721000	M-A, Shabby, and Zara.
2721000	2723000	I believe we're all going live as well.
2723000	2725000	This is the shortest stream for me.
2725000	2729000	We will be redirecting into Shabby Cottonbomb.
2730000	2733000	Sounds like a piece of rubber stuck to the surface.
2733000	2734000	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
2734000	2737000	Hey, yeah, I was a good girl this stream.
2738000	2740000	I did everything correct, yeah.
2740000	2742000	Sounds like one of those squeeze stress toys.
2742000	2744000	Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
2750000	2752000	Yeah.
2753000	2757000	I just don't want to risk it, and also you only want to say the name right.
2758000	2760000	I don't even know why I said it.
2760000	2761000	I forgot.
2761000	2763000	Wait, you're going already?
2763000	2764000	No.
2764000	2768000	I'm gonna do, Jen, I'm gonna do Kremlin ASMR.
2768000	2770000	I'm gonna do ASMR like me.
2771000	2774000	Look, I even have this to put on your ears.
2774000	2775000	Are you ready?
2775000	2777000	Look, look, look, look, look.
2778000	2780000	I'm gonna put this on your ears.
2780000	2781000	Ready?
2784000	2785000	Look.
2786000	2788000	You're almost home.
2793000	2795000	You can do ASMR.
2799000	2800000	Yeah.
2802000	2803000	This is nice.
2806000	2809000	I'm rubbing them all against your ears.
2809000	2814000	I put winter earmuffs on your ears.
2822000	2825000	Wow, dinner didn't stream with absolutely no ears.
2826000	2829000	What do you mean by cats fighting at the start of the stream?
2829000	2833000	I'm not gonna leave a like, and then don't leave my son.
2835000	2837000	Yeah, you're so fluffy.
2838000	2840000	You're so fluffy.
2842000	2844000	You're so fluffy.
2847000	2851000	First time I was into ASMR, I'm gonna come back for more.
2852000	2854000	Glad I could take it.
2857000	2861000	It's nice to have a short stream to recover from your infinite stamina.
2862000	2866000	My voice is really broken, but because I'm whispering, you can't tell it's broken.
2869000	2872000	Some people like chugging ASMR.
2872000	2874000	I have lots of chugging.
2874000	2875000	Water.
2875000	2876000	Okay.
2877000	2883000	Have I been a good girl for you?
2892000	2893000	Wait, wait, wait.
2907000	2909000	Yeah, I forgot my tea.
2909000	2912000	I've got a cold cup of tea over here.
2913000	2916000	But it was a lot of fun doing that ASMR.
2916000	2920000	And really, sorry, my throat is making throat noises.
2923000	2927000	Yeah, but this is just kind of a little bit of a challenge.
2927000	2929000	I'm gonna do ASMR.
2930000	2931000	Yeah.
2933000	2937000	Yeah, but this is just gonna be an easier stream.
2938000	2944000	Because I don't want to break my voice.
2945000	2949000	This is the closest I've ever been to being fully transitive.
2949000	2952000	I'm usually so focused on trying to go under.
2953000	2958000	See, but I think because I didn't plan any of what I was seeing,
2958000	2963000	because I was like natural, it made it easier to enjoy.
2963000	2964000	You know?
2964000	2966000	That's probably why.
2970000	2972000	Be a good girl and swallow what you...
2974000	2977000	Reflings, we're trying to leave this up.
2978000	2981000	Will you ever do a full hypno video?
2981000	2983000	Yeah, definitely.
2984000	2986000	I need to make sure I make it safe though.
2986000	2992000	I need to educate myself a bit more, because I need it all to be safe.
2992000	2997000	Which is why I'm not doing any permanent effects on this stream.
2997000	3001000	Because I may or may not have an interest in permanent effects,
3001000	3008000	but I already have an audio recorded that undoes any effects that I may do on you.
3008000	3011000	But I really like the permanent effects stuff.
3011000	3014000	I'm sorry, it's just what I'm interested in.
3014000	3016000	And I may want to break you a little bit, but just a little bit.
3016000	3018000	It's not going to be bad or anything.
3018000	3021000	Like it's just going to be a wee bit of breaking, okay?
3021000	3022000	Just a wee bit.
3022000	3023000	Not a big bit.
3026000	3029000	So yeah, I need to make sure I do it 100% safe.
3029000	3031000	And it's filbert.
3031000	3033000	Break me moment.
3034000	3040000	To keep up the buns, I just have to say, you and your eyes wear a strong ashing.
3041000	3043000	Thank you.
3043000	3045000	I love it.
3046000	3048000	If you need to present, break, take or leave it.
3048000	3050000	And before we commit more times.
3050000	3051000	Hey, yeah.
3052000	3053000	Effects like what?
3053000	3057000	Oh, so there's like different kinds of like hypno.
3058000	3066000	And so you can purposely make like trainer ones where like I train you.
3066000	3072000	Like I literally path off your subconscious to react to me or to do something.
3072000	3075000	Or react in a certain way.
3075000	3079000	And I need to make sure it's super safe.
3079000	3087000	And I need if I do an audio that basically states that like I don't have an effect on you anymore.
3087000	3092000	It tells your subconscious to throw everything that you learned out the window.
3092000	3094000	And then it's all safe.
3095000	3101000	Welcome to Stronikato's YouTube where safety number one priority.
3101000	3103000	Thoughts already doomed.
3104000	3108000	Stroni and her permanent effect will be like you will only do your thing to me.
3108000	3111000	Basically, kind of.
3111000	3113000	It's the plan.
3113000	3118000	I want to do like sessions that last two hours long.
3120000	3121000	I can't wait.
3121000	3125000	I know my voice is going to be fried, but yeah.
3128000	3131000	Will there be lullabies for the replaying?
3131000	3138000	My voice is broken, but I know you are my sunshine.
3138000	3141000	You are my sunshine.
3141000	3143000	My only sunshine.
3143000	3146000	You make me happy.
3146000	3148000	When skies are gray.
3148000	3151000	You'll never know dear.
3151000	3153000	I'm a giant of you.
3153000	3158000	So please don't take my replaying away.
3158000	3161000	Lullabies!
3161000	3164000	I don't know many other lullabies.
3167000	3171000	Freerishaka, Freerishaka.
3171000	3174000	Dormithu, Dormithu.
3174000	3179000	Would be cool if you had a button that made the camera zoom in on your eyes.
3179000	3185000	Or, well, next stream I'll have a tracker so it follows my head around.
3185000	3188000	So you can't escape my eyes.
3188000	3190000	But I wanted to go very easy.
3190000	3193000	Very easy on the first one.
3193000	3195000	Please don't take my sunshine away.
3195000	3198000	Dormithu, Dormithu.
3200000	3202000	There is that cradle one.
3202000	3204000	The cradle you will fall.
3204000	3208000	Rock by baby on the tree top.
3208000	3212000	When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.
3212000	3215000	I don't know the rest.
3215000	3218000	What were your inspirations for being?
3218000	3219000	I have no theme to career.
3219000	3223000	I've always, always loved it.
3223000	3225000	I've always loved it.
3225000	3230000	But I have always known how deep the rabbit hole goes.
3230000	3233000	And I've touched on surface level.
3233000	3237000	But I was like, I want to go, I want to go rabbit hole.
3237000	3239000	Sorry, the wire is spilling on the desk.
3239000	3243000	I, I want to go all in, baby, all in.
3245000	3248000	So, well, the table at the top will be fixed.
3248000	3251000	I can fix it now if you tell me how to spell the word.
3251000	3253000	What's the word?
3253000	3255000	Be'er me, was it?
3255000	3257000	Ah, bear me.
3257000	3260000	Be'er me, I knit it.
3260000	3262000	Be'er me, I knit it.
3262000	3264000	Okay, then you'll just let that sit.
3266000	3268000	Okay, you even have to bring Cremlund.
3268000	3271000	Cremlund, know.
3271000	3273000	Cremlund.
3273000	3275000	Wow, look at that.
3275000	3277000	Super professional.
3277000	3279000	Sorry.
3279000	3280000	We're going down the after-roll.
3280000	3288000	After all, yeah, there's like so much to it that I just knew I couldn't do it until, until it would stay.
3289000	3290000	And now it's time.
3292000	3296000	Well, tippy tippy, I'm crimsonized, yeah.
3296000	3298000	Don't be expecting anything serious from me.
3302000	3307000	Oh, did you, like, make my head load, obnoxiously load my keyboardist?
3307000	3309000	Oh, yeah, it's so good.
3311000	3318000	So I, for triggers, I like double finger-clicking.
3318000	3320000	I like finger-clicking.
3320000	3331000	For words or phrases, I want to do what you kindly, I want to do mehabs, because I say mehabs all the time.
3331000	3335000	Mehabs, refling, you want to go deeper?
3337000	3342000	Would you kindly, refling, go deeper with me?
3342000	3345000	Like, oh, those are such good trigger words.
3347000	3348000	But yeah.
3349000	3352000	Is Strony susceptible to hypnosis?
3352000	3353000	Yes!
3353000	3355000	My biggest enemy are mirrors.
3356000	3362000	Unfortunately, I can fall to my own hypnosis, but it only lasts 24 hours.
3362000	3364000	It's fine, it's fine.
3366000	3368000	Would you kindly, would be a lyric?
3368000	3371000	Yes, we're literally doing it off of BioShock.
3371000	3376000	Look, look, um, we're gamers out here, okay?
3376000	3383000	We're gamers, we're here for the memes as well, but it doesn't mean we can't incorporate
3383000	3388000	our favorite games into our other activities.
3389000	3392000	Strony drilling on the floor in front of a mirror.
3392000	3397000	Stop, I want to order so much artwork about all these, like, different plots.
3397000	3401000	I'm like, oh no, the reflings have found me.
3402000	3405000	Just going to beat you into a mirror.
3406000	3415000	We didn't, oh no, but we are doing hypnosis in general, but I've already done the segment
3415000	3423000	because I need to be gremlin gamer mode right now, because it's me, I can't help it.
3423000	3427000	I'm just a freaking meme lord, it's hard to be serious, okay?
3428000	3436000	Yeah, enjoy the memes while enjoying our, you didn't finish that segment.
3436000	3438000	Why are you not finishing?
3438000	3440000	We're not here gaming.
3440000	3444000	We're only big gamers here, you dun scoops.
3445000	3457000	Remember that a man, a man leads a slave obeys, and reflings we obey.
3457000	3459000	What the orges come from the cutie?
3459000	3463000	Yeah, put on a suit for your serious stream.
3463000	3471000	Oh, a man chooses, oops, sorry, a man chooses a refling obeys.
3471000	3477000	Oh wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, wait, pause, pause, pause the tunes.
3477000	3480000	Okay, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.
3480000	3484000	Oh hi, I see in berries, hold on, we're caught in bio shock.
3487000	3495000	A man chooses a refling obeys.
3496000	3501000	Oh wait, why is my freaking calibration, I was looking at the polling.
3501000	3507000	Hi, A.C. in snowberries, I promise I'm not trying to hypnotize you, we're in gremlin hours, okay?
3507000	3515000	Hi, A.C. girl, I was your rave, I hope your voice is okay, I was watching you in the bath again.
3516000	3529000	I take a bath every morning to try and steam my throat before stream, and A.C. is live, so I was watching her, and she dressed up as a princess the way Mercy Drew are.
3529000	3534000	If you guys didn't see Mercy Drew, I'll turn it off, it was amazing.
3536000	3544000	Maybe at the end of stream, I will do, I will do, maybe, serious mode, okay?
3544000	3552000	I'm actually gonna make sure I'm reading into Sheebie, sorry, I'm reflecting to the screen right now.
3552000	3568000	But yeah, let's just, hold on, customization, redirect, we partied now, all the snowberries are tired, little babies.
3568000	3576000	Sheebie's playing call of the lamb, oh my god, I think me and Sheebie may be doing multiplayer call of the lamb.
3576000	3581000	Is it Sheebie first and then Azura, and then Mercy?
3581000	3585000	Who's coming online first, Azura or Mercy?
3585000	3588000	Eh, Azura or Sheebie?
3588000	3591000	Shoulda picked Mercy.
3591000	3595000	Uchi-san, party, hot, tall, that's terrible.
3595000	3601000	Did Uchi-sans have a good time, or are you all ready for a nap after that?
3601000	3604000	Hold on, I'll just check, who comes online first.
3604000	3609000	Is it Azura or is it Azura, Azura?
3609000	3614000	Wait, where's, I just announced the girls on my screen.
3614000	3620000	But yeah, first Azura live in, how long?
3620000	3624000	Azura's live, oh wait, in 5, 10?
3624000	3627000	Okay, no, it's definitely Sheebie that comes up next.
3627000	3634000	Sorry, it was amazing, oh Uchi-sans, time to put you to sleep.
3634000	3639000	Come here old man, you're done for.
3640000	3651000	You partied so hard with Azura, and she showed you how much energy she has, yeah.
3651000	3659000	Oh, and if you sub all your energy, Uchi-san, they may pay you to sleep.
3659000	3663000	Better grant them.
3663000	3666000	I'm ready to jump on my man.
3666000	3674000	Yeah, I made a little induction at the end of the stream, but right now we're Kremlin mode, okay?
3674000	3677000	I can't be serious.
3677000	3684000	I laughed, I cried, I oooged, I am I supposed to even pronounce that?
3684000	3688000	Even in our ASMR stream, she speaks fast.
3688000	3691000	Oh yeah, you think that's speaking fast?
3692000	3699000	Can you be serious, not for long?
3699000	3702000	Kremlin mode activated, yeah.
3702000	3707000	Shhh, we're real ASMRs out here.
3707000	3714000	I'm speaking in a chanted main craft table.
3714000	3721000	It's pronounced U-O, U-O.
3724000	3728000	Surely you can be serious, but what was that?
3728000	3738000	It's called Ace Globes, because A.C. finished their stream, I'm using Ace Globes.
3738000	3751000	I fell farther in love with my cute and funny Uchi-san loving Oshii, and this is why we don't have chat on screen during ASMR streams.
3751000	3757000	What is that? It's the unknown.
3757000	3764000	Ace should introduce you to Aigar, his Aigar.
3764000	3769000	Ace Globes are so nice, yeah.
3769000	3776000	Mercy had some Ace Globes in her ASMR, and Amy got skamaste on Ace Globes.
3776000	3781000	I don't know if she said the story yet, so I'll let her tell the story.
3781000	3786000	Ah, I feel better already.
3786000	3789000	You and Aigar will get along well.
3790000	3795000	I feel better already, yeah.
3795000	3799000	There's no permanent influence on this stream, what does that mean?
3799000	3810000	So some hypnosis ASMR is like to mark you and leave you with a present,
3810000	3818000	and I'm not doing that because we are slowly working our way.
3818000	3825000	You have to take things slow and take your time,
3825000	3836000	and I'm gonna take my time with you briefly and get you all tired.
3837000	3842000	Oh, it's a reference to the polar bear game.
3842000	3849000	Would you ever use water next to a $2,000 microphone?
3849000	3854000	I don't know, this is the best water you're gonna get.
3854000	3859000	Permanent hypnosis is just a gift that keeps on giving.
3859000	3862000	Slow indoctrination.
3862000	3865000	Would you kindly rethink?
3865000	3868000	Let me do what I want to, yeah.
3875000	3880000	It's time to come down from the party snowmaries.
3885000	3889000	You're under the sea, don't need hypnosis for that.
3890000	3897000	Today was already a chill day for me, so this stream was really fit, and I'm glad.
3897000	3901000	I'll try to do ASMR streams every week.
3901000	3907000	Yeah, my back hurts, okay, true OG sounds for it.
3907000	3912000	But yes, I will do ASMR every week.
3912000	3915000	Some more intense than the others.
3915000	3923000	Some plots as well, like fill, probably plots, egg and live.
3923000	3929000	And I do, like, when I get you guys to talk and give me suggestions,
3929000	3933000	I do apologize if you typed for me to say something.
3933000	3937000	I had to make sure it fitted with the theme,
3937000	3940000	which is why I brought you up so I can start being a gremlin again,
3940000	3944000	because I didn't want you to be down and be gremlin mode.
3944000	3952000	Big Willy Wallace is probably when my back's gone after that DJ stream.
3952000	3954000	That's so good.
3954000	3957000	I break from my own mind every year.
3957000	3959000	Oh yeah, some good plots.
3959000	3966000	Oh yeah, some real deep thought-provoking plots.
3966000	3969000	Okay, let me see if this is a freaking dragon.
3969000	3973000	I think, because I want to show off.
3973000	3977000	Okay.
3977000	3980000	Okay, I think this better.
3980000	3983000	My mouse dragon just kind of stops working after all,
3983000	3987000	saying, I think it gets confused with the ASMR mic.
3987000	3990000	You like the background, thanks.
3990000	3993000	I made it myself.
3993000	3996000	I did it.
3996000	4001000	I'm not like it in Adobe After Effects.
4001000	4005000	Bass streamer and vealer.
4005000	4009000	All my girls were bass streamer and vealer.
4009000	4012000	They're all the best.
4012000	4014000	Yeah, no.
4014000	4016000	You do, you strong, we still love you.
4016000	4019000	Yeah.
4019000	4022000	That background is amazing, yes.
4022000	4025000	I can also go faster or slower,
4025000	4029000	but I'll do that another time.
4029000	4033000	But just so that I can really make it intense, okay?
4033000	4038000	Like, this sound you hear,
4038000	4042000	I can also make it faster and more intense.
4042000	4046000	So please don't think I haven't thought this through.
4046000	4049000	Wait, wait, wait.
4049000	4052000	It's over for you.
4052000	4054000	Don't resist.
4054000	4057000	There's no point in resisting.
4057000	4060000	Okay, little wreathling.
4060000	4064000	You are mine.
4064000	4067000	Just give me some time.
4067000	4070000	Just let me kick.
4070000	4072000	Let me kick.
4072000	4074000	There.
4074000	4076000	And then what?
4076000	4080000	Oh no, all my money's going into your pocket.
4080000	4085000	That's terrible, wreathling.
4085000	4089000	Yeah.
4089000	4092000	That sin doesn't have any side effects.
4092000	4094000	No, none of them have secret.
4094000	4096000	I have no secret agenda.
4096000	4099000	Thank you, window for cracking during the ASMR stream.
4099000	4103000	That window cracked like three times during my segments.
4103000	4106000	I was like, really, you're getting rude.
4106000	4108000	I wasn't sure if I liked the background noise,
4108000	4109000	but I really like it.
4109000	4111000	Oh, if you don't like that noise,
4111000	4116000	don't worry, I'll train you to like it.
4116000	4119000	Just stop resisting.
4119000	4121000	Your efforts are futile.
4121000	4124000	You will not win against me.
4124000	4126000	I have unending stamina.
4126000	4128000	Are my streams not proof enough?
4128000	4131000	Wah, thank you for today.
4131000	4134000	Erwin Blair, thank you for the tip.
4134000	4138000	Yes, let's give all money to feel it.
4138000	4141000	Thank you for the tip, Erwin.
4141000	4144000	Support my babies.
4144000	4147000	Support my babies so they can move out,
4147000	4152000	and I can buy them a better internet connection.
4152000	4154000	Thank you so much for the tip, though.
4154000	4158000	I appreciate it greatly.
4158000	4160000	I need some hydration.
4160000	4162000	You can hear some ASMR calls.
4169000	4171000	Ah, all gone.
4171000	4174000	Ah, none left.
4174000	4176000	Thank you.
4176000	4178000	Wow.
4178000	4182000	Strani, does the cuttlefish's rope effect only have one speed?
4182000	4184000	Yes, only one speed.
4185000	4188000	I didn't want people to think I'm doing a rave.
4192000	4195000	I'll fight Mummy's unending stamina with my own.
4195000	4198000	Let's see how it comes out on top.
4198000	4200000	Me.
4205000	4208000	Oh, the cuttlefish is amazing.
4208000	4212000	The cuttlefish is gonna give...
4212000	4215000	Ay-yo, I can't read that out.
4215000	4220000	Oh, my money's gonna skew, gosh.
4220000	4223000	For those of you who did join in a little late,
4223000	4234000	my YouTube channel's been spent for monetization.
4234000	4239000	I'm actually getting a manicure and a pedicure today
4239000	4243000	in preparation for my monetization stream.
4243000	4246000	So there's your hint.
4246000	4249000	Hopefully it comes through quickly.
4249000	4251000	And I'm very excited.
4251000	4253000	Zeroed in audible.
4253000	4255000	Yeah, I did it into my...
4255000	4257000	I'm wearing a hoodie.
4257000	4259000	I'm wearing a hoodie.
4259000	4263000	But yeah, I'm getting my first ever manicure and pedicure.
4263000	4265000	I have no idea what...
4265000	4269000	So I think they like massage your legs as well.
4269000	4275000	So I'm gonna like get nice and smooth and like shave my legs.
4275000	4281000	Just to make sure they don't have to touch my like stubbly legs.
4281000	4284000	But yeah, I will be interesting.
4284000	4287000	Maybe I should like live tweet my experience
4287000	4290000	and being like, oh, the person's doing this now.
4290000	4292000	They're doing this to my foot.
4292000	4297000	Because I've never had like a pedicure is when it's your feet.
4297000	4300000	Because pediatry is feet care.
4300000	4305000	And then manicure, mangy tuples are your hands.
4305000	4309000	And well, the rest of the VL urgent begin monetization too.
4309000	4313000	Yes, they are being submitted today.
4313000	4317000	I believe we are waiting for the YouTube stats to update.
4317000	4319000	Because they're taking their sweet time.
4319000	4323000	It took a week for the statistics to update.
4323000	4328000	And then everyone is doing their monetization celebration streams.
4328000	4333000	And ooh, everyone's eating good.
4333000	4335000	That's all I'm gonna say.
4335000	4338000	It may as well be...
4338000	4342000	Oh no, it may as well be Thanksgiving.
4347000	4354000	What the fuck?
4354000	4357000	My tech...
4357000	4360000	What?
4360000	4363000	What the fuck?
4363000	4365000	My phone?
4365000	4368000	My phone?
4368000	4370000	My tech talk?
4370000	4373000	I was so scared.
4373000	4375000	Oh my god.
4375000	4378000	I was so scared.
4378000	4379000	My phone...
4379000	4383000	My tech talk just opened up on its own.
4383000	4385000	Bruh.
4385000	4386000	China's listening in.
4386000	4388000	What the fuck?
4388000	4391000	What the fuck?
4391000	4395000	My phone just opened up on its own.
4395000	4400000	To play a freaking advertisement to me.
4400000	4402000	What was that?
4402000	4404000	I thought someone was outside in the garden.
4404000	4406000	I was like, oh my god, there's someone outside my house.
4406000	4408000	I need to end the stream right now.
4408000	4410000	That was scary.
4410000	4415000	Oh my god.
4415000	4418000	I got so scared there.
4418000	4419000	I was like, what?
4419000	4421000	China, I'll prove to you, sir.
4421000	4424000	My Chinese credit just went up by 100K.
4424000	4427000	That was horrifying.
4427000	4428000	I thought that was...
4428000	4429000	I got freaking out.
4429000	4430000	I was like, what?
4430000	4433000	I should be the only thing making noise.
4433000	4436000	What was that?
4436000	4437000	Wow.
4437000	4439000	My heart rate has accelerated.
4439000	4442000	Literally, my social credit just went up.
4442000	4446000	What on earth?
4446000	4450000	I think that was an ad because I opened tech talk.
4450000	4458000	And then, like, it loaded a video or something.
4458000	4459000	We can hire her.
4459000	4462000	She said, okay, I'm not doing hypnosis.
4462000	4463000	I'm gremlin mode.
4463000	4465000	Read the top.
4465000	4467000	That's what you get for having TikTok.
4467000	4470000	That's what I get for brain run.
4470000	4472000	That was scary.
4472000	4474000	Jeez.
4474000	4476000	Okay, what was I saying before that?
4476000	4478000	Oh, monetization.
4478000	4486000	Wait, is monetization a trigger word for the TikTok spies?
4486000	4489000	They want the money too.
4489000	4491000	What is it?
4491000	4494000	Oh, do you want RBSMR?
4494000	4499000	I don't think I have a ceiling on it.
4499000	4501000	A member ceiling.
4501000	4503000	The numbers made fun, honestly.
4503000	4507000	Because I was talking about monetization and then the hand.
4507000	4512000	TikTok loves monetization.
4512000	4514000	I said, yeah, give me some of that.
4514000	4516000	Jeez.
4516000	4518000	Okay.
4518000	4521000	Let's drag you back into ASMR.
4521000	4522000	That freaked me out.
4522000	4524000	That was scary, because I was like, hello?
4524000	4526000	Hello, who's there?
4526000	4528000	Refill yourself.
4528000	4530000	Refilling is like you.
4530000	4534000	Okay.
4534000	4536000	Just save money.
4536000	4539000	Shhh.
4539000	4541000	I accidentally woke up.
4541000	4542000	What happened?
4542000	4544000	My freaking phone started playing ads.
4544000	4547000	Even though I didn't touch my phone at all.
4547000	4549000	I don't like, I'm not bringing.
4549000	4550000	I don't like that.
4550000	4553000	That was scary.
4553000	4555000	We're in your walls.
4555000	4556000	Oh my gosh.
4556000	4559000	Okay, let's see if we can do RBSMR.
4559000	4562000	I need to put you over my hoodie, okay?
4562000	4564000	But maybe a little loud.
4564000	4566000	But this is my heart.
4566000	4568000	I'll do this side, because it's easier.
4568000	4570000	You have one.
4570000	4572000	Thank you.
4573000	4578000	Can you hear it?
4581000	4584000	Can you hear my heart at all?
4595000	4597000	Yeah.
4602000	4604000	That's my heartbeat.
4604000	4606000	Is it fast or slow?
4606000	4610000	It might be fast, because I'm talking.
4610000	4613000	That's why at the doctor's office,
4613000	4619000	they tell you not to talk when you take the pressure cuff on your arm.
4633000	4638000	Do you want to see how fast my heart can go?
4638000	4641000	We're going to mess around, okay?
4641000	4644000	I'm going to turn the volume down.
4662000	4664000	Okay.
4692000	4701000	And that's just my heart.
4703000	4705000	I'm hearing mummies.
4705000	4707000	You heard my stomach sound.
4707000	4709000	Stop.
4716000	4719000	That's how fast my heart can really go.
4723000	4727000	Can I ruin a surprise for you guys?
4727000	4731000	Because it's my content, I'm allowed to ruin the surprise, okay?
4734000	4737000	The stomach was louder than the heart.
4739000	4745000	I'm going to do an ASMR video, like a role play,
4745000	4750000	where you are pregnant and you're in my tummy
4750000	4753000	and I'm talking to you about how proud I am
4753000	4758000	and how excited I am for everything you're going to achieve in your life.
4758000	4761000	And I can't wait for you to experience the world
4761000	4766000	and it's going to have my actual heartbeat and stomach zones in it.
4766000	4771000	And I'm going to tell you all that you deserve,
4771000	4774000	all the good things in life that happen.
4774000	4777000	And I'm going to be your cheerleader.
4778000	4783000	And yeah, I need to get the Artwork Commission though,
4783000	4787000	because I need to draw me pregnant with you in my tummy.
4787000	4792000	And I'll be wearing like a mummy outfit and everything.
4792000	4798000	So yeah, and I'm going to tell you how excited I am for you
4798000	4804000	to get to know you and I get to see what your personality is like
4804000	4807000	and you're going to be perfect in every way,
4807000	4812000	because there's no way that my little reef link can do any wrong.
4816000	4819000	That's strangely, yeah, and you're going to hear my tummy sounds
4819000	4822000	and my heartbeat and my voice is going to be muffled.
4822000	4824000	It's going to be like this, okay?
4824000	4827000	This is what my voice is going to sound like.
4828000	4832000	And I'm so proud of you.
4832000	4834000	Oh, my voice is so broken.
4834000	4838000	I'm sorry I broke my voice, so this doesn't sound very pleasant.
4841000	4847000	But I'm so proud of you and I can't wait to meet you
4847000	4852000	and I can't wait to watch you grow up
4852000	4855000	and do all the things you love
4855000	4860000	and see what hope is you fall in love with.
4860000	4864000	And you're going to be so smart like your mummy.
4871000	4873000	Your broken voice sounds like sadness.
4873000	4876000	Oh, no, no, I know it's sad.
4876000	4879000	I'm sad that I didn't have my cup of tea,
4879000	4884000	but I had a lot of fun getting you very deep into the moment.
4884000	4886000	Who's the daddy?
4886000	4889000	You again, reef link.
4892000	4895000	Don't you not know the feeler lore?
4895000	4900000	The reason why I have five dollars is all because of the reef links.
4902000	4908000	See, in order to make sure that no one reef link can claim that they're the daddy,
4908000	4912000	all of us got together, turned the lights out and just went for it.
4912000	4914000	Okay, we just went for it.
4914000	4916000	That's how we have five dollars.
4916000	4938000	We should do that again sometime.
4938000	4942000	You want to find you will both get the ace more both hired out.
4942000	4949000	We've actually been confirmed that we are showing up to a convention, but it's in 2025.
4951000	4954000	But I think it's in California.
4955000	4956000	Ah.
4960000	4961000	Yeah.
4962000	4966000	I'm all the reeflings on the daddy. No, I won't take my mists.
4967000	4969000	But yeah, very excited.
4969000	4974000	I don't know, it would be nice if we could all meet up at a convention, but I don't know how the girls feel about her.
4974000	4979000	And I have absolutely horrific travelling, sorry.
4980000	4982000	So I'm gonna be so high.
4983000	4985000	I'm gonna be high on medications.
4988000	4991000	I'm paying for that backstage box.
4992000	4996000	Honestly, I'm the feather.
4996000	4998000	Oh, I'm the father, does a backflip.
5000000	5002000	Getting the VIP treatment.
5002000	5003000	Oh yeah.
5005000	5008000	I wish I could go to the con. I don't know if I can go to the con.
5009000	5015000	So please do not book any conventions, like for this whole purpose, in case I show up, that's not how it works.
5016000	5022000	Mummies do weaknesses, travel and mirrors.
5022000	5033000	I mean, I'll tell it in another stream, but yeah, it's a very unfun story, surrounding the toilet.
5037000	5040000	My backyard would love to go next.
5041000	5043000	That would be really cute, yeah.
5046000	5051000	Understood booking all conventions on the slim chance that you show up, yeah.
5055000	5063000	Oh my gosh, but then, stick an entire brief worth of people in a tumble dryer, and you basically get all the feel.
5066000	5071000	If we basically boomed you with five dollars, shall we do it again with another five?
5071000	5075000	No, with another six.
5076000	5079000	Come on, mommy needs to cook.
5081000	5084000	Like 41 hours away from California.
5084000	5088000	I think it's in California, I don't know, I actually know where it is.
5092000	5094000	Six, yeah.
5094000	5107000	Every jan and vealer, in theory, has six girls, and there should be one design of each that you gravitate towards.
5111000	5120000	That's right, I may not be the smartest, but I know what to do someday, but I like being dumb.
5121000	5124000	I like reeflings doing all the thinking for me.
5126000	5129000	What if you gravitate towards all the designs?
5130000	5133000	I don't know, I feel like one has to speak to you.
5137000	5140000	So you are the oven, I'm just an oven.
5141000	5144000	I just need you to fill it, let's be dumb together.
5144000	5154000	You're great, except for the naming part, exactly.
5156000	5159000	What do you mean strony 365?
5159000	5166000	I wonder if I called myself strony 365, because my secret goal was to stream every single day for a year.
5167000	5173000	But, yeah, we're already going to blow that out of the water, unless I'm gravely ill.
5175000	5177000	Smooth out the brain wrinkles.
5178000	5180000	This is something I can get by.
5180000	5183000	What if I'm gravitated towards the accent instead?
5184000	5186000	Then who's out going me?
5186000	5190000	I like this accent, that's what tickles your pickle.
5190000	5196000	Oh, then he might need me, I'll tickle that pickle any day, I will.
5198000	5200000	What do you mean?
5201000	5203000	You will always be my Oshie.
5203000	5205000	Oh, thank you.
5208000	5215000	See, I'm here because Fiche, who doesn't like Fiche, also impressive Xbox, keep collection.
5215000	5216000	What's that?
5216000	5218000	Yeah, he's been an Xbox kid, oh, so cool.
5218000	5222000	I used to be one of those kids in the YouTube comments that were like,
5222000	5225000	Xbox is so much cooler than PlayStation.
5225000	5229000	Yeah, PlayStation sucks, yeah.
5231000	5234000	The accent is good, it's above.
5234000	5238000	The accent's funny, it can be sexy when I put it on.
5239000	5244000	I feel like if I want to do a voice that commands you,
5244000	5248000	I need to go deeper.
5250000	5253000	I'm a console warfare, and yeah.
5254000	5259000	See, I was bursted, and had to be tested from a carpet sale for a fiber.
5259000	5261000	PlayStation died.
5262000	5265000	Yeah, PlayStation drills.
5266000	5269000	Strangely, I was on the right team for a day one.
5269000	5273000	Not beating the comeyoshi allocations.
5277000	5282000	The Scottish accent is sexy, I didn't even know.
5283000	5286000	Like my actual accent when I'm monthly.
5286000	5288000	I'm like, oh, who's it going lads?
5288000	5291000	I'm, yep, this is so as I'm pleased.
5294000	5297000	We better have some backpapes at the convention.
5297000	5299000	No, that's awful.
5299000	5302000	I double in 360, but I was a Nintendo kid.
5302000	5305000	Nintendo was so expensive.
5305000	5307000	My dad got me a Nintendo DS,
5307000	5313000	but he was always happier to let me buy like secondhand Xbox 360 games
5313000	5317000	over Nintendo's secondhand, because it was so expensive.
5317000	5323000	We used to have this game shop in the UK called GameStop or Game.
5323000	5326000	I think they both went bust, I can't remember.
5327000	5334000	And basically, with what?
5334000	5338000	They went bust, but they used to sell secondhand games,
5338000	5340000	and that's how I got all my games.
5340000	5342000	They used to do what was called trade-ins,
5342000	5345000	and I would have to trade in my games to get new ones.
5347000	5349000	I think Game Stations bust now.
5349000	5352000	Yeah, wasn't it called EB games?
5353000	5354000	No.
5354000	5357000	Now in the UK, not that I know of,
5357000	5361000	you aren't wrong though about Nintendo being far too expensive.
5361000	5362000	Yes.
5362000	5365000	And they just shut down the eNintendo store.
5369000	5371000	I think GameStop is still a thing.
5373000	5375000	Did you ever go to CEX?
5376000	5378000	I don't think so.
5379000	5383000	I think most game stores did a version of a trade-in model.
5383000	5385000	Yeah, that's how I got my games.
5386000	5388000	It's been Game Station.
5388000	5389000	Oh, maybe it's Game Station.
5389000	5391000	Study GameStop.
5393000	5395000	Maybe Game Station.
5396000	5398000	Just remember, I was a weebabi,
5398000	5400000	I just looked at the covers of the games and went,
5400000	5402000	Dad, I want that one.
5402000	5404000	EB is...
5404000	5405000	Wait, what?
5405000	5407000	EB Games was in the UK.
5408000	5410000	Oh, yeah, no.
5412000	5415000	If it went bust in 2002, yeah,
5415000	5418000	I never experienced EB games.
5420000	5422000	I was Xbox for a long time then Switch
5422000	5425000	because the Japanese make some fire games.
5428000	5430000	Game is still a thing in the UK.
5430000	5432000	GameStop is still a thing in the US.
5432000	5436000	I'll go EB games.
5436000	5438000	We're just EB sleepy gamers.
5441000	5443000	I miss choosing games by the cover
5443000	5445000	now I Google them things endlessly.
5445000	5448000	Yeah, if you're ever one in a new game
5448000	5450000	to completely time sync
5450000	5453000	and you play PC for mods,
5453000	5456000	I recommend the painting of Isaac
5456000	5458000	and I'm not recommending it
5458000	5462000	just so you guys can all princess carry me through the game.
5463000	5465000	It's a very big game.
5465000	5467000	Big and gay, big and gay.
5473000	5475000	Yeah, in the UK,
5475000	5477000	this game now, GameStation,
5477000	5479000	all go, go, go.
5479000	5482000	EB Games was absorbed by GameStop.
5482000	5484000	Oh my god, we're getting the lore.
5484000	5486000	We're getting the capitalism lore.
5487000	5489000	Ooh, yeah, painting of Isaac.
5490000	5491000	Yeah.
5491000	5493000	The painting of Isaac doesn't work anymore
5493000	5495000	in your PC, huh?
5498000	5501000	Yeah, I had an Xbox, just an Xbox.
5502000	5504000	Oh, the Xbox original.
5508000	5510000	I wanted to get my 360,
5510000	5512000	but I think it's messed up.
5512000	5516000	It's the latest console I own by a country male.
5518000	5521000	Here's a more hands-down based story.
5523000	5525000	I'm sure I've just misread that,
5525000	5528000	but you actually made cameo.
5528000	5530000	Yeah, it's like fantasy game.
5531000	5533000	It's really nice.
5533000	5536000	If you're talking about Xbox exclusives,
5536000	5538000	if you're talking about overall,
5538000	5540000	yeah, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,
5540000	5541000	yeah, sorry, you've just miss,
5541000	5543000	you've just misspelled Assassin's Creed,
5543000	5546000	it's fine, you spell it as, as in,
5546000	5548000	creed, yeah, no, it's fine,
5548000	5550000	you've just misspelled, don't worry about it.
5550000	5553000	I can read through your head missing.
5557000	5559000	Any fellow guitar hero enjoyers?
5563000	5565000	I wish Army of Two was multiplayer,
5565000	5567000	but no, I don't think.
5568000	5570000	I would love to do Army of Two.
5572000	5574000	Oh, did you ever have a Game Boy?
5574000	5578000	I did, and I had like three Game Boy games.
5581000	5586000	My dad, so if my dad bought the console,
5586000	5589000	he would let me play it basically,
5589000	5591000	and he bought a Game Boy,
5591000	5594000	and he didn't like it, so he gave it to me.
5597000	5601000	And I've played Pokémon Ribby,
5601000	5606000	I've played Legend of Zelda Minish Cap,
5607000	5610000	and one more game.
5612000	5615000	I'm sure there's one more game I probably played.
5617000	5620000	The Minish Cap is my only Zelda game.
5620000	5622000	Oh, my voice is breaking.
5623000	5627000	Legend of Zelda Minish Cap.
5628000	5629000	Oh, sorry.
5630000	5633000	Oh, no, wait, no, sorry, tapping ASMR.
5633000	5635000	Little, little tappies.
5636000	5638000	Doesn't actually sound that nice.
5641000	5643000	I don't know what 33 Immortals is.
5643000	5645000	I haven't heard about it, have we?
5645000	5647000	What's your favorite Pokémon?
5647000	5649000	And why is it Shantler?
5649000	5651000	I actually didn't mean Lewek.
5651000	5652000	Lewek is so cute,
5652000	5654000	but see, Pokémon have this thing
5654000	5658000	where they make a really cute, adorable, creepy Pokémon,
5658000	5660000	and then its evolution is Oakland.
5661000	5664000	I don't even want ugly, ugly evolutions.
5664000	5667000	Lewek is adorable, it's an MMO.
5667000	5671000	I don't know, we're knee-deep in RuneScape right now.
5672000	5675000	I took the console with me everywhere.
5675000	5677000	It'd be the crap out of the paint's worn out,
5677000	5679000	but it still works.
5679000	5682000	Old school games, I don't see.
5682000	5686000	Literally think of, what is it, Joystick Drift?
5686000	5688000	No, that's not a gender name.
5689000	5691000	It's a Joy-Con Drift.
5691000	5694000	Oh, that's a Joy-Con Drift on Nintendo Switch,
5694000	5697000	but Game Boy Advance's that were made
5697000	5699000	how many years back still work.
5699000	5702000	I'm catching up on Old School RuneScape vision now.
5706000	5710000	Did y'all know there was a Pokémon card game on Game Boy?
5710000	5711000	Nope.
5712000	5714000	It's in the up-gaming.
5714000	5716000	Sorry, my voice is cracking.
5717000	5719000	Hello, I've got 25 minutes,
5719000	5721000	and then I'm going on official vocal rest,
5721000	5723000	and we are reading into Shibi playing.
5723000	5727000	If you didn't know, Cult of the Lamb is a 10 out of 10 game.
5727000	5729000	I rate it very highly.
5734000	5737000	I had a Game Boy card game, it was so fun.
5738000	5741000	Courtney was all, it was Courtney.
5741000	5744000	The Game Boy card game was actually really good.
5744000	5747000	Sorry, you can't go back to sleep, me as well, cook something.
5747000	5749000	Oh, very good.
5749000	5752000	And Jack and Kenabiana.
5752000	5753000	Ah!
5753000	5755000	Ah, yo.
5755000	5758000	Cult of the Lamb isn't your first update.
5758000	5760000	Cult of the Lamb's multiplayer,
5760000	5763000	so I'm going to force Shibi to play it with me.
5767000	5770000	I still have my Pokémon card game on Game Boy.
5770000	5773000	Yeah, I'm going to go to work, see you next dream.
5773000	5775000	Yeah, I'm ending.
5775000	5780000	We're going to redirect into Shibi in 20 minutes, okay?
5783000	5787000	You should play with us as cultists, then starting.
5788000	5790000	I don't know how the multiplayer works,
5790000	5792000	but we'll see.
5792000	5794000	Cult of the Lamb is Twitch integration.
5794000	5799000	I don't know if YouTube wants to do that kind of in-game integration or not.
5803000	5805000	Damn, it feels like the stream just started.
5805000	5808000	I mean, in terms of insurance, yeah.
5808000	5810000	Have you ever played War Thunder?
5810000	5812000	No, it's how we...
5812000	5814000	It's local co-op, I could have sworn.
5814000	5817000	As all they said, I had multiplayer, am I going crazy?
5818000	5821000	What are you doing after stream?
5821000	5824000	I'm going to make a cup of tea to soothe my throat,
5824000	5829000	and then I'm going to message clippers
5829000	5833000	and check any clips that the girls might have had.
5833000	5837000	And then I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.
5837000	5842000	I can't believe I'm saying that, but yes, I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.
5842000	5848000	And then I'm going to edit some ASMRs in preparation of getting monetized,
5848000	5851000	so I can upload those 1K special videos,
5851000	5858000	and I will probably write the script for the pregnant with you ASMR
5858000	5864000	that I want to make, and I'll most likely contact an artist as well about it.
5867000	5871000	But yeah, quite a few things I need to catch up on,
5871000	5874000	especially with the insurance streams.
5874000	5879000	I'll probably be listening to Shibi in the background as she plays.
5880000	5885000	So whoever said War Thunder, you only play that game if you hate yourself.
5885000	5888000	But yes, I have a big day, big day.
5888000	5894000	I don't know if I should show a picture of my feet and hands afterwards,
5894000	5900000	because some people don't like streamers that do hand cam or whatever.
5900000	5904000	I'm very sorry if, you know, get filler, get filler, get filler.
5904000	5910000	But yeah, literally tomorrow you get to see my hands.
5910000	5915000	Wow, whilst I eat the American candy, wow.
5915000	5920000	I get to try A&W visages.
5920000	5925000	It's like a cream and soda, it's said, but I don't normally drink cream and soda.
5928000	5931000	And what other? I think there is Twizzlers.
5931000	5937000	There is like Spacey Hot Cheetos or something, or Takis.
5937000	5941000	I get to try Takis, the scrawny grippers.
5941000	5946000	Wait, do you want me to put the feet in the stream as well?
5946000	5949000	I mean, I can do it.
5949000	5952000	I can put my feet in the stream if you want.
5952000	5955000	Okay.
5955000	5959000	You wish as my command.
5959000	5964000	You guys don't understand, like, you might be used to streamers out here
5964000	5966000	that don't do what you want.
5966000	5968000	You do not understand.
5968000	5970000	I will do what you want.
5970000	5972000	Send me what you want.
5972000	5975000	Let me know.
5975000	5980000	Like, as much as I am in command of you, you are in command of me.
5983000	5990000	I will think of a humorous way to incorporate my feet into moral stream, okay?
5990000	5992000	College kid names.
5992000	5995000	My little baby replaying.
5995000	5997000	We need the scrawny thighs.
5997000	6000000	Can I put thighs? I don't know.
6000000	6002000	I've not decided on my outfit.
6002000	6004000	I think I'm just wearing fishnets, I'm sorry.
6004000	6007000	I can't believe I actually have to put clothes on for a vacant stream.
6007000	6008000	You guys are terrible.
6008000	6012000	Please, let me put on my smile.
6012000	6015000	Right, I'm just going to check Marshmallow.
6016000	6020000	Just because we're actually getting really close to the end.
6020000	6022000	Oh, that's a lot of Marshmallows.
6022000	6024000	Oh my.
6024000	6026000	That was a lot more than yesterday.
6030000	6033000	What's mommy going to do?
6033000	6036000	Mommy's going to do whatever she wants to.
6038000	6040000	Oh, sorry.
6045000	6047000	I love your hypnosis.
6047000	6051000	I get happy every time I go under someone else's influence.
6054000	6057000	I'm so glad I did so well during that section.
6064000	6066000	Okay, okay, okay.
6067000	6069000	Hey.
6071000	6073000	Yeah, sorry.
6073000	6077000	I'm reading Marshmallows, but pretty much none of them can be said on stream.
6077000	6079000	Yippee.
6079000	6083000	This is the part where I'm supposed to be like a business person.
6083000	6088000	I'm supposed to be like, oh, but what does my ghost do it?
6088000	6092000	Are you a bit of a meat and then as far as wishing marks?
6093000	6101000	I mean, I could try and do hypnosis again, but it's probably not going to be that good.
6101000	6108000	I need to be in the zone to corrupt you, but because I've been allowed to meme, I feel like myself.
6108000	6111000	And I'm just some goofy dork, like honestly.
6111000	6115000	Business strongy, yapper strongy, professional strongy.
6115000	6117000	I wear so many hats.
6117000	6120000	Why is animus showing us a strange cold?
6124000	6125000	Not enough time.
6125000	6127000	Your error, goofy dork.
6127000	6129000	Yay, communist hole.
6130000	6132000	I've already prayed in obedience.
6135000	6137000	Jokes on you, how many of them?
6138000	6139000	Uh...
6147000	6152000	Hey strongy, after a year of waiting, you've really surprised me.
6152000	6153000	Well, I'm just...
6155000	6160000	I have been afraid to die for a while and decided I'd support your project regardless of the quality,
6160000	6165000	but the girls are great and the content is stellar, I'm glad.
6165000	6172000	I usually just work at lurk and watch streams, but I felt like I had to tell you.
6172000	6178000	I love mommy and I love when she's... and I love what she's done with the place.
6178000	6180000	I love you too, little refling.
6180000	6183000	I'm so glad you love the girls as well.
6183000	6191000	I was really worried that, like, you guys would think, like, go support them, you know?
6191000	6192000	Cause I'm not.
6193000	6200000	She said she wasn't in a hidden program and I hope you're having as much as a good time as the reflings are,
6200000	6203000	and in any case, thank you.
6203000	6205000	Oh, I'm having a good time.
6205000	6207000	The only reason I ain't doing insurance...
6208000	6212000	That's my voice and this is how I talk.
6215000	6220000	I'm a little broken, but I can bypass that by whispering at the moment.
6222000	6226000	That's the reason why I'm not doing an insurance stream today or tomorrow.
6230000	6232000	But don't worry, you can fix me.
6232000	6234000	I just need some of your ink, okay?
6234000	6238000	So send me your ink and marshmallow right now.
6239000	6241000	Wait, we got a tip. I need to read it.
6241000	6243000	Let me read it.
6245000	6247000	Airwind player, thank you for the tip blown away today.
6247000	6249000	Thank you so much for the hypnosis.
6249000	6250000	Look forward to what's to come.
6250000	6252000	I'm glad you enjoyed it.
6253000	6255000	Really amazed at how good this is going.
6255000	6256000	Much love.
6256000	6257000	Thank you.
6257000	6259000	Don't strain your voice by whispering too much.
6259000	6263000	It's really weird because I broke...
6263000	6268000	So my voice is broken and whispering breaks your voice further,
6268000	6271000	but I can bypass my voice right now by whispering.
6271000	6272000	It's crazy.
6272000	6273000	I don't know how it works.
6275000	6277000	We whisper.
6277000	6278000	Yes.
6278000	6280000	Very inkable.
6282000	6287000	The urge to use my tongue right now is very high,
6287000	6288000	but I shan't.
6288000	6292000	I won't refrain from such sins.
6293000	6295000	I won't refrain, okay?
6295000	6298000	Getting, getting, getting incredible.
6302000	6305000	But yeah, I'll go on vocal rest for today
6305000	6309000	because I don't have to record anything
6309000	6312000	and I need to send collab partner scripts.
6313000	6314000	Wow.
6314000	6316000	SlySaber, thank you for the tip.
6316000	6318000	It says, thanks for the ASMR.
6318000	6319000	Here's your inking.
6322000	6324000	My voice is so broken.
6328000	6331000	TinySpany, thank you for the tip.
6331000	6334000	I just got some iron prayer delivered shop.
6334000	6337000	So I'll try score soda for the first time tomorrow on stream
6337000	6338000	when you try chord stuff.
6338000	6340000	Yay, let's go.
6340000	6342000	I have iron brew too.
6342000	6344000	Actually, I'll drink iron brew with you.
6345000	6347000	Oh, you made me ink.
6350000	6353000	Like, it's supposed to be good for the throat, okay?
6358000	6361000	I'm so professional, okay?
6364000	6369000	But yeah, I will definitely take a really good look at marshmallows shortly.
6369000	6371000	A lot of them cannot be said.
6372000	6374000	Mayhaps in membership streams.
6375000	6376000	You never know.
6376000	6381000	Nine out of ten doctors recommend, oh yeah, our refling doctors.
6383000	6385000	Good for the throat, sure.
6385000	6388000	I mean, want to find out.
6390000	6391000	This is terrible.
6395000	6397000	Don't you want to help me?
6398000	6400000	Help me feel better.
6402000	6403000	Come on.
6406000	6410000	If you can do something to help me, I'll be good, okay?
6412000	6414000	But you need to be good in return.
6416000	6417000	Be good for me.
6419000	6421000	Give me what I need.
6421000	6423000	Give me what I need.
6429000	6430000	That's terrible.
6432000	6433000	Okay, no going under.
6433000	6434000	No going under.
6434000	6435000	Stop.
6435000	6436000	It's just me.
6436000	6438000	I'm still memeing, okay?
6438000	6439000	I'm still memeing.
6440000	6444000	Not a doctor, but three years into a doctorate.
6447000	6450000	If mummy asks refling's answer,
6450000	6452000	what, another tip?
6453000	6455000	Everyone player, thank you for the tip.
6455000	6457000	Yeah, it helps, Johnny.
6458000	6461000	I don't know why sometimes the message displays
6461000	6463000	and then it doesn't display.
6463000	6465000	It's been so silly.
6466000	6469000	Can you make your background go a bit faster?
6469000	6471000	Right now, I don't think so.
6471000	6476000	But I do have alternate dingy mobobbers.
6476000	6477000	Oh wait, here we go.
6477000	6478000	Are you ready?
6481000	6482000	Wait.
6484000	6485000	Yeah.
6487000	6489000	I can do like this.
6491000	6493000	It's going so fast.
6493000	6496000	Do we need to slow down or do we need to speed up?
6502000	6505000	That's terrible, isn't it?
6505000	6507000	Just terrible.
6508000	6511000	But that's as fast as I can make it.
6515000	6517000	So hopefully that's faster now.
6517000	6519000	Speed up or slow down?
6519000	6520000	Yeah.
6522000	6525000	Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.
6526000	6527000	Okay.
6528000	6531000	That should be the correct settings.
6532000	6533000	I think.
6534000	6536000	Trucks on you are always under.
6537000	6539000	Yeah, I get to set the pace.
6539000	6541000	Just don't make it too fast.
6541000	6543000	Don't want anyone out here.
6544000	6545000	Let's see.
6549000	6551000	Nero, thank you for the tip.
6551000	6554000	It says all my ink blocks to you, Johnny.
6554000	6555000	You just need to ask,
6556000	6558000	have I broken you already?
6558000	6559000	Yeah?
6560000	6562000	Am I alleged to break you?
6564000	6567000	Have I still got the effect on my voice,
6567000	6569000	or is it normal again?
6571000	6572000	Wait, what?
6572000	6573000	What?
6574000	6575000	What?
6576000	6577000	My pupils are broken.
6579000	6580000	It's normal.
6581000	6583000	Okay, you broke us a long time ago.
6583000	6585000	Can't break what's already broken.
6587000	6590000	I see a few of you are already broken in for me.
6591000	6593000	You broke me at a low.
6595000	6599000	Your hair looks like the famous spiral candy.
6599000	6601000	I forgot his name.
6602000	6604000	I don't know what it is.
6604000	6606000	My seashells, or my hair.
6611000	6613000	I'm going to be honest, I wouldn't take much.
6616000	6617000	It's over.
6617000	6618000	Over.
6619000	6621000	That's cheating, Johnny.
6621000	6623000	Look, I will get my way.
6624000	6626000	I said unending stamina.
6626000	6627000	I meant it.
6632000	6634000	He broke me at the one.
6634000	6635000	It's too far.
6635000	6637000	Your voice is so entrancing.
6638000	6640000	Yeah, when it's not broken.
6640000	6642000	Hopefully, I will do better soon.
6642000	6644000	And I can have much more.
6644000	6645000	Ismar.
6647000	6649000	I am folding like a towel.
6652000	6654000	No, it's not a spring mill.
6656000	6659000	Unending stamina gives me every day.
6659000	6660000	Yeah, it does.
6660000	6661000	It should.
6665000	6668000	Should I do vocal requests
6668000	6670000	for the rest of the stream?
6671000	6673000	And you guys take what you want me to do.
6673000	6675000	It's to solve it for myself.
6676000	6679000	I did that under a surface ASMR.
6681000	6684000	There's only so much better I can draw.
6687000	6689000	I'm just skull-brained, okay?
6689000	6691000	I'm just a bit skull-brained.
6693000	6696000	I've already folded and put up in the linen closet
6696000	6697000	ready for use.
6701000	6702000	You want shh.
6705000	6706000	Shhh.
6715000	6718000	You're asking for all you want me
6719000	6720000	10 to 0.
6726000	6729000	We've only got 8 minutes left.
6730000	6733000	8 minutes.
6736000	6739000	I don't even know if I'm allowed to do your kissing.
6740000	6742000	My dummy's making a noise.
6743000	6746000	Can you hypnotize us to be good dogs for Shabby's stream?
6747000	6749000	I would love to do that.
6749000	6750000	Can we do that?
6752000	6753000	Can we do that?
6753000	6754000	Can we please do that?
6754000	6755000	Can we please do that?
6755000	6758000	Please let me hypnotize you to be a dog for Shabby.
6758000	6760000	Please, please, please, please, please.
6761000	6763000	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
6763000	6765000	Let me set up for this.
6765000	6766000	I'm so serious.
6767000	6768000	I need to set up for this.
6768000	6770000	Hold on, let me drink some water as well.
6770000	6771000	I'm so serious.
6775000	6777000	Or I am so serious.
6777000	6778000	Okay.
6779000	6781000	Let me just decrymify myself
6781000	6783000	because we're going serious mode.
6787000	6789000	Wait, I'll do one last calibration
6789000	6792000	because this iPhone is killing me.
6793000	6794000	Okay.
6796000	6797000	Okay.
6798000	6799000	Okay.
6801000	6802000	Let's get to work.
6806000	6807000	Oh no, that's not it.
6807000	6809000	Oopsies, played the wrong one.
6818000	6819000	There, there.
6820000	6823000	I'm not the only one
6823000	6825000	that can look after you this way.
6827000	6828000	In fact,
6830000	6832000	I have five more
6832000	6834000	that I refer to
6835000	6836000	as my daughters.
6839000	6840000	There is one
6842000	6844000	who will join you soon.
6845000	6847000	She will look after you.
6849000	6850000	But there's a catch.
6851000	6852000	What a refling.
6854000	6856000	You need to be well-behaved.
6858000	6859000	Okay.
6861000	6863000	Almost like a dog.
6866000	6869000	You know how to be a good dog, don't you?
6870000	6872000	You need to be malleable.
6873000	6875000	Follow commands.
6877000	6879000	Be told what to do,
6879000	6880000	what to say,
6881000	6882000	what to think.
6885000	6886000	You are nothing
6887000	6888000	but a pup
6889000	6891000	for her amusement.
6893000	6894000	And in the end,
6895000	6897000	you are nothing but a pup.
6898000	6899000	And in turn,
6900000	6902000	you will amuse me.
6905000	6906000	So be good.
6912000	6913000	Don't worry.
6914000	6915000	It'll wear off soon.
6917000	6918000	After her stream.
6920000	6921000	But for now,
6923000	6924000	good pup speak.
6925000	6926000	And they go park.
6930000	6931000	Don't they?
6933000	6934000	Yeah.
6935000	6936000	And then,
6937000	6938000	they wait
6939000	6940000	on the command
6941000	6942000	of their owner.
6946000	6947000	You are orange.
6948000	6949000	Do you understand?
6950000	6951000	You do not have
6952000	6953000	free will.
6956000	6957000	You're a mutt
6961000	6962000	ready
6962000	6963000	to do the bidding
6964000	6965000	of your owner.
6968000	6969000	So let her have fun,
6970000	6971000	okay?
6973000	6974000	And in turn,
6975000	6976000	I will have fun
6976000	6977000	and you
6978000	6979000	will have
6980000	6981000	fun.
6986000	6987000	So don't think
6989000	6991000	not until you're told otherwise.
6994000	6995000	Because in three minutes,
6997000	6998000	I'm going to hand
6999000	7000000	the imaginary leash
7002000	7003000	over
7004000	7005000	to your owner.
7006000	7007000	Your new owner.
7009000	7010000	Don't worry.
7011000	7012000	It's temporary.
7015000	7017000	But you'd like that, wouldn't you?
7018000	7020000	Get to play with a new owner for a while.
7023000	7024000	Good pup.
7025000	7027000	You deserve some head pads, don't you?
7029000	7031000	Oh, you're a good boy.
7033000	7034000	Such a good boy.
7036000	7038000	And it feels so rewarding
7038000	7040000	to hear praise, doesn't it?
7042000	7044000	In two minutes,
7045000	7047000	you get your new owner,
7048000	7049000	just temporary,
7050000	7052000	for a little while.
7054000	7056000	And she'll give you all
7057000	7058000	the attention you need,
7059000	7060000	all the love.
7062000	7064000	And I'll reward you
7064000	7065000	extra
7066000	7068000	when you come back to me, okay?
7071000	7073000	So you'll be good, won't you?
7074000	7075000	Little pup.
7076000	7077000	I've taught you well.
7079000	7080000	You know how to behave.
7082000	7083000	So be good.
7085000	7086000	In one minute,
7088000	7089000	your new owner
7090000	7091000	will take your leash
7092000	7094000	and build you along with her.
7097000	7098000	Okay?
7101000	7102000	Good little pup.
7104000	7105000	Such a good,
7107000	7108000	good boy.
7113000	7114000	Oh,
7115000	7116000	I hear her.
7117000	7118000	She's coming.
7119000	7121000	I hope you're ready.
7124000	7125000	Zero.
7131000	7132000	Good talk.
