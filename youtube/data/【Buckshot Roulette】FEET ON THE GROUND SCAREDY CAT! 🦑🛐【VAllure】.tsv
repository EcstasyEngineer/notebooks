0	5000	No time to wait for my days, we're getting longer in peace
5000	10000	No time to wait for my days, of all the time
10000	16000	Right, this is British lore
16000	18000	Oh wait, hold on
18000	25000	Dule Lover, thank you for becoming a member, I have no idea what it's like even says I'm online yet
26000	30000	No it doesn't, oh this is the thing, whenever I look back on a board
30000	37000	I'm like rambling to myself for a full minute, because for some reason it doesn't bring itself up for a full minute
37000	40000	Even though I'm sitting here, meh meh meh, but when I look back on the board
40000	43000	And all that, it's all fine
43000	45000	It's all fine
45000	47000	The fine line
47000	50000	Right, where are we? Nope
50000	52000	Nope, not yet
52000	54000	Not playing the game yet
54000	61000	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, I am your host, Ronnie Cuttles
61000	64000	Coming at you with a fried voice, thank you
64000	68000	Dule Lover becoming a member in case that did not register
68000	69000	She loves it, she loves it
69000	72000	On time question mark, yes I haven't been lurking in the shadows
72000	78000	I had to do some bit of background work
78000	81000	What's the background work you ask?
81000	86000	I put Shabby Cottonbombs memberships live, so if you want to be a cheeky harem and get in
86000	89000	But she might not say your name during the stream though
89000	92000	You're probably better waiting on the stream in two hours time
92000	98000	Shabby Cottonbombs, maybe I should be a bit bigger, can I talk in a minute?
98000	103000	I'm looking and looking
103000	106000	Well I'll just stand right here, like right over the text and everything
106000	110000	Why not? Why not? Why do I have to be professional?
111000	114000	Hold on, I'll actually go weave, because BOOM!
114000	118000	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, little reeflings
118000	125000	What is on the agendination for week three?
131000	138000	So we're starting off strong with an ASMR stream at the usual time
138000	144000	And then after two hours I will go offline and have a 15 minute peace break
144000	150000	Because we're going to be doing our first membership watch-along
150000	157000	Which is none other than the first Transformers movie with Sam Witwicky and Bumblebee
157000	161000	Sweet little Bumblebee, I know what he wants from me
161000	166000	To kill the Decepticon and stop them from ruining the planet
167000	172000	And then the following day, on a Tuesday for the rest of the world
172000	176000	We are playing Zelda Minish Cap
176000	181000	Now statistically this game takes roughly eight hours to finish
181000	184000	Whether or not it takes me eight hours, I don't know
184000	191000	But we will be taking a pause 15 minutes before because for a member stream
191000	194000	We're going to be doing the forbidden tear list
195000	199000	Not the way you want, the big yin
199000	203000	And I get to answer it honestly this time
203000	207000	Because I'm allowed to say what I want to say
207000	212000	If we do not finish it in the first day, which is unlikely due to the member stream
212000	218000	Then the rest of the day on Wednesday is dedicated to Zelda Minish Cap
218000	224000	But it's the only Zelda game I have ever completed or played
224000	227000	I know it's shocking, hold on, wait
227000	230000	Whoa, it won't let me stretch out chat
230000	232000	Chat, you'd let me stretch it
232000	235000	Why the frick frack diddly-dat-tick-tack?
235000	237000	Does it not let me stretch chat?
237000	241000	Wait, is it because I normally have you on the screen?
241000	246000	Oh my god, let me stretch you, why is it locked?
246000	249000	Chat is locked for me, so I can't even read just properly
249000	251000	Brev, Brev
251000	254000	I'm trying to explain what we're doing
254000	257000	Anyway, I'm going to-
257000	261000	Eh, you be next, thank you for becoming a member
261000	266000	Oh my god, is that the mascot for, um, we Louie Vuitton Inc?
266000	272000	I'm so sorry, her name evades me right now from all the live, Louie Vuitton Inc
273000	276000	Oh my god, why is her name not in my mouth?
276000	283000	Purple, with the most adorable little sea ears
283000	286000	Oh my goodness
286000	288000	Anyway
288000	292000	Um, we are going to do Old School RuneScape on Thursday
292000	294000	Oh, and now my chat's broken completely
294000	299000	Oh, thanks OBS, no really, thank you, please don't ever cook again
299000	302000	Oh, it finally worked, in on, yes, in on
302000	305000	Oh my goodness, I don't know why chat wasn't working
305000	308000	Chat, yeah, well it's fixed, I can actually read chat now
308000	311000	In on, yes, in on, in my whole, thank you
311000	316000	Um, let's see, so then we're going to do Old School RuneScape
316000	322000	However, check it, I'm doing my first ever one-on-one collab with the other girl
322000	327000	And guess what, it's with Mercy
327000	330000	I should have picked any kind of yandere
330000	332000	But I got Mercy
332000	335000	And we're going to be playing Goose Game, we're going to be playing it at her time
335000	337000	So we're only going to do a little bit of RuneScape
337000	341000	But if I can get a couple of levels in, I will take it
341000	345000	Um, so a couple hours of RuneScape and blabbing away
345000	348000	And then I will go offline for a few hours to recharge
348000	353000	Because I want to give Mercy my all, she's not ready for the Rotism Your Honor
353000	358000	Hey, thank you, Omarum Simpson
358000	362000	It still doesn't display properly, even though I have the full chat up
362000	365000	Memberships are showing up for me on YouTube mobile
365000	368000	For a sheebie cotton bum, they better be because we are redirecting into her
368000	374000	If you didn't know, sheebie has posted pictures of herself in a self-made cosplay of sheebie
374000	376000	Yep, that's a full sentence
376000	379000	You may check them out by discovering the alternative twirers
379000	385000	If you don't know what the alternative twirers are, feel free to check out who the accounts are following
385000	392000	But yes, at Mercy's usual stream time, I wanted to make the collab super easy for her
392000	396000	So I am going to have to rest and snort
396000	398000	Some...
398000	400000	I shouldn't have said that
400000	402000	I'm going to be taking lots of cola, okay
402000	405000	I'm going to be slurping my cola for any caffeination
405000	407000	Because I'm probably going to be a wee bit
407000	409000	I'm going to start lagging a little bit there
409000	410000	Are you squiddin' me right now?
410000	412000	Ain't I meant for you either
412000	414000	You don't have to give me money to tell me this
414000	417000	You just realise that, Omarum
417000	420000	You don't have to give me money to type things in chat
424000	425000	Scotland, whatever
425000	427000	Yes, erm
427000	430000	Well, I was originally going to do a heart rate monitor this stream
430000	432000	Count up for the life of me, find it
432000	436000	I bought a new heart rate monitor because my other one was bust
436000	438000	And it's already gone
438000	440000	So I think I'm about to purchase a third one
440000	441000	Lucky me
441000	442000	I'll probably...
442000	445000	If I send a care package to the girls like for Donothons
445000	447000	Others have cubed mascots
447000	450000	We have a cubed Scottish girl
451000	452000	What?
455000	456000	Wait
456000	458000	Did Brian talk?
459000	461000	Did Brian say...
461000	463000	No, did Brian say anything there?
464000	466000	Oh shit, I didn't see that
466000	468000	Aren't...
468000	470000	Others have cubed mascots
470000	473000	We have a cubed Scottish girl
473000	475000	Thank you for the five iron report
475000	476000	I appreciate it
476000	477000	Oh, I never heard that
477000	479000	Sorry, I have my headset muted
479000	481000	Because I have the freaking game sound in the background
481000	482000	It's so loud
482000	484000	Are you squiddin' me right now?
484000	486000	Can't wait to see Strone as the imposter in this game
487000	489000	Wait, what?
490000	491000	No, wait
491000	493000	We're playing Nero
493000	496000	We're playing a game called Untitled Kiss Game
497000	502000	If you didn't see AC actually revealed that she's playing with Emmy
502000	504000	On a game called Don't Starve
504000	506000	And I'm like, jeez, that's a bit brutal
506000	508000	That's exactly AC's lore
508000	511000	Because she had to hunt for her food
511000	513000	So, rather curious
513000	515000	Rather curious, aren't they?
517000	518000	Okay
523000	524000	What else? Elden...
524000	526000	Yes, Elden Ring the DLC
527000	529000	Elden Ring the DLC, okay
529000	531000	It launches on Friday
531000	533000	I'm like 99% sure
537000	540000	Even if it doesn't come out by the time we start playing
540000	544000	We have a lot of areas to clear anyway
544000	547000	And I am under the impression
547000	550000	We have to perish the enemy
550000	552000	That's at the top of this elevator
552000	554000	In that graveyard
555000	558000	And ironically Ryan Goslin was the one
558000	560000	That vanquished him
560000	561000	Because I couldn't do it
561000	563000	I kept getting attacked
563000	566000	So the reflands on a freaking debuff
566000	568000	Like a severe debuff
568000	570000	Whilst I was running away from this boss
570000	571000	All came flying in
571000	573000	And I'm like 99% sure
573000	575000	Ryan Goslin killed that one
577000	578000	I do say shortcaller
578000	580000	Now I do have a shortcaller
580000	582000	We're gonna test it out at the start stream
582000	584000	If I can handle it
584000	587000	I will permit my reflings to zap me
587000	589000	Every time I cause us to die
589000	592000	I will try and keep the heart rate monitor too
592000	595000	Just so you can see how freaking messed up I get
595000	597000	Whenever we get near an enemy
597000	599000	Now
599000	602000	I need you to open your eyeballs for me
602000	605000	Because members asmr stream starts
605000	607000	One hour earlier
607000	609000	Than my usual start time
609000	611000	The reason for that is
611000	613000	Emi
613000	614000	Azura
614000	615000	Mercy
615000	616000	Strawny
616000	618000	Are doing a four man uno collab
618000	621000	So that I can't get away from mercy this week
621000	623000	I'm already entangled in her snare
623000	625000	And then
627000	629000	So that's two streams that day
629000	630000	Yeah
630000	632000	And
632000	634000	And then and then and then
634000	636000	Sorry I did apologize for your head
636000	638000	I didn't get a good sleep last night
638000	640000	Again
640000	642000	I'm getting very tired
642000	644000	Actually I'll tell you something really bad
644000	646000	So I had to take sleep medicine the other day
646000	648000	But whenever I take sleep medicine
648000	651000	I have problems going number two
651000	652000	Okay
652000	653000	And
653000	655000	And then I hurt my butt going number two
657000	658000	So
658000	660000	If there's any
660000	662000	Anyone that wants to help kiss it better
664000	667000	And then Elden Ring part two
668000	671000	We again will have a full endurance on that
672000	674000	I am literally weaving
674000	676000	So much content in between this as well
676000	678000	Because I'm also starting up
678000	680000	My thank you series
680000	682000	My one ASMR video pair
682000	684000	1000 views thank you series
684000	686000	I am absolutely
686000	688000	Delighted and exhausted
688000	690000	To learn that I
690000	691000	My
691000	693000	Scheduled
693000	695000	Uploaded ASMR for 1000 subs
695000	697000	I've already reached 7000
697000	700000	Which means the debt of six is still to be paid
702000	704000	I'm very thankful
704000	706000	Oh man I'm tired
706000	708000	After this stream today
708000	710000	I'm actually going to record
710000	712000	Three
712000	714000	Collab ASMR's from my side
714000	717000	Because three girls have given me their side
719000	720000	So
720000	722000	I need to edit that
723000	726000	Unending ASMR's
726000	728000	Back to back to back
730000	732000	There's so many replays now
732000	735000	I know my mum is very busy
735000	737000	If you didn't know
737000	740000	AC's meme ASMR has gone live
740000	742000	It is sniffing ASMR
742000	744000	If you like that trigger
744000	746000	Mercy's ASMR has
746000	748000	I got a fucking cat here in my mouth
748000	750000	All the time
750000	752000	You really do get used to it
752000	754000	When you get cats honestly
754000	756000	You're just like oh that's just another part
758000	761000	Mercy has released Yandere ASMR
762000	764000	Please if you absolutely despise
764000	766000	The meme ASMR's I got them to create
766000	768000	Well guess who fucking
768000	770000	Created them for them
770000	772000	So if you hate them don't be like
772000	774000	Mmm this video is stinky
774000	776000	Be like mmm strongy stinky
776000	778000	Because she came up with a concept
778000	780000	So don't if you didn't like it
780000	782000	Don't worry it's not like it's the only ASMR video
782000	784000	They're ever going to produce for free on youtube
784000	786000	Like fucking relax
786000	788000	For one
790000	792000	I'm sorry I'm literally fighting imaginary people
792000	794000	Not one person has said that
794000	796000	At all I know for a fact no one has said that
796000	798000	And I'm like already swinging
798000	800000	On behalf of the girls
800000	802000	Like don't say nothing about my girls
802000	804000	But yes
804000	806000	Mercy's ASMR actually
806000	808000	I was influenced by well
808000	810000	So I had already created this
810000	812000	Over a year ago
812000	814000	And I think this was before the creator
814000	816000	Of Yandere Sim got outed
816000	818000	For all of his
818000	820000	I'm 32
820000	822000	You have so much power over me tweets
822000	824000	Or whatever the tweet was
824000	826000	I can't remember the ins and outs
826000	828000	But
830000	832000	If you didn't know
832000	834000	In Yandere Sim there's a mechanic
834000	836000	Where in order to lower your craziness levels
836000	838000	You need to laugh
838000	840000	You need to laugh very loud
840000	842000	And very startling
842000	844000	And if anyone is around you while you laugh
844000	846000	It alerts them
846000	848000	And I was like how did I do that for Mercy
848000	850000	So I did an intro
850000	852000	A little setting up the plot
852000	854000	She comes and finds you type thing
854000	856000	And then she laughs like a maniac
856000	858000	Ear to ear in the mic
858000	860000	And I absolutely love it
860000	862000	But I think that's cause
862000	864000	I knew about it. I've never actually played Yandere Sim
864000	866000	But yeah
866000	868000	Preemptive defense is a good strategy
868000	870000	Literally just smashing people's skulls in
870000	872000	No one has said a thing to me
872000	874000	But the rage has already taken over
874000	876000	The only discord group with speedrun pan records
876000	878000	Honestly
878000	880000	Also Emi and Momi's ASMR came out
880000	882000	Oh did Emi release it
882000	884000	So
884000	886000	I went the complete
886000	888000	Meme route for Emi
888000	890000	But Emi isn't quite
890000	892000	With me on the same page
892000	894000	Which is fine, it's completely fine
894000	896000	She has complete control
896000	898000	So I was like upload it if you want it
898000	900000	Oh wait she did upload it
902000	904000	Okay
904000	906000	So she kept the thumbnail the same
906000	908000	Okay I thought she wasn't gonna like it
908000	910000	Okay
910000	912000	So she's called the video
912000	914000	Alleyway Tingle Dealer
914000	916000	Sells you completely legal tingles ASMR
916000	918000	That's good title
918000	920000	I like that title
920000	922000	My title was
922000	924000	VTuber Sells You
924000	926000	Tingles in an alleyway
926000	928000	I think or something like that
928000	930000	We did have to
930000	932000	The artist at the time drew
932000	934000	Emi
934000	936000	Sorry they're twins
936000	938000	drew Emi
938000	940000	So we had to put a little
940000	942000	Sutton Sutton over
942000	944000	I loved the 30 minute Japanese one
944000	946000	I'm glad you enjoyed it
946000	948000	That is basically what unscripted
948000	950000	ASMR turns it into
950000	952000	If I don't have a script I will
952000	954000	YAP my head off
954000	956000	So Emi also has her meme ASMR
956000	958000	Now that she's monetized which is
958000	960000	Fan Tiddlyastic
962000	964000	The next
964000	966000	Meme ASMR
966000	968000	Which I'm actually gonna ask her permission
968000	970000	To do it once
970000	972000	Once your monetization stream
972000	974000	I know professional streamer by the way
974000	976000	Once your monetization stream

990000	992000	ASMR
992000	994000	You guys are gonna freaking love the plot
994000	996000	Shibu's plot was so unique
996000	998000	I had to go away and record
998000	1000000	Folly sounds which is rare
1000000	1002000	For me because I have a massive bank
1002000	1004000	Of sounds that I can
1004000	1006000	Come from

1196000	1198000	In that short
1198000	1200000	Is because of strawnee

1624000	1626000	You're teasing me refling
1632000	1634000	How do you think your dad would respond
1634000	1636000	If
1636000	1638000	Refling said
1638000	1640000	Or calls me daddy too
1640000	1642000	Would I call you daddy
1642000	1644000	I wouldn't think I'd call you daddy
1644000	1646000	Like in my accent
1646000	1648000	Daddy's pretty jarring and cringe
1648000	1650000	Like oh yeah I like that daddy

1668000	1670000	If I explain it
1670000	1672000	I don't think he's going to get it
1672000	1674000	I think he's going to be like what
1676000	1678000	Oh I don't think he's going to confirm
1678000	1680000	That would be amazing
1682000	1684000	Oh yeah daddy
1684000	1686000	Give me a spicy sausage

1878000	1880000	Get supported, get supported, get supported
1882000	1884000	Nero
1884000	1886000	Imagine thinking that listening
1886000	1888000	That would be crazy
1888000	1890000	And mommy and daddy and I think
1890000	1892000	Accent isn't hot that would drive

1900000	1902000	Oh my god do you know those convention
1902000	1904000	Signs
1904000	1906000	Those VTuber conventions where they like hold a sign
1906000	1908000	And it's like five dollars to get stood on
1908000	1910000	Bro
1910000	1912000	50 cent for me to smash my
1912000	1914000	Arse on your face how about that
1914000	1916000	One cent for me
1916000	1918000	A whisper daddy
1918000	1920000	In your ear how about that
1920000	1922000	Okay
1922000	1924000	We're going to do a thing at this VTuber convention
1924000	1926000	Called undercutting the market
1926000	1928000	You offer your goods
1928000	1930000	At an unbelievably discounted price
1932000	1934000	Now I know undercutting
1934000	1936000	Normally implies there's going to be
1936000	1938000	A raise later on
1938000	1940000	We ain't raising none of the prices
1940000	1942000	The prices you see are the prices you get
1942000	1944000	Pills out 20 bucks
1944000	1946000	Take all my change that's a steal
1946000	1948000	Strongly really undercutting the market now
1948000	1950000	I'm like 99% sure
1950000	1952000	I saw a cosplayer meme
1952000	1954000	And she genuinely had a sign
1954000	1956000	That said like five dollars
1956000	1958000	To be stepped on and she was like
1958000	1960000	I made like four hundred dollars
1960000	1962000	In a day type thing
1962000	1964000	So I guess
1964000	1966000	For that much we are getting married
1966000	1968000	With 50 children
1968000	1970000	Thank you for the
1972000	1974000	Is that Poland
1974000	1976000	I don't know what that is
1976000	1978000	Pozka
1978000	1980000	So I guess for that much
1980000	1982000	We're getting married with 50 children
1982000	1984000	Nah no children
1984000	1986000	Did you see Azura's alternative artwork
1992000	1994000	She did break all
1994000	1996000	What Azura did what
1998000	2000000	I didn't know she was down like that
2000000	2002000	I didn't know she was
2002000	2004000	Down like that
2004000	2006000	She drew that of her
2006000	2008000	She drew that
2008000	2010000	Yes Azura is an artist if you didn't know
2010000	2012000	Literally all the girls have some sort of
2012000	2014000	Drawing
2014000	2016000	History
2016000	2018000	Background

2036000	2038000	Oh no
2038000	2040000	I don't know how to draw
2040000	2042000	Actually I could
2042000	2044000	I should have shown it on the hand cam stream
2044000	2046000	I tried to
2046000	2048000	Learn to draw
2048000	2050000	And I was consistent for like five days
2050000	2052000	Before work just got far too much
2052000	2054000	I couldn't keep up with work naturally
2054000	2056000	And the only thing
2056000	2058000	I was wanting to draw
2058000	2060000	Was the girls
2060000	2062000	So I have like terrible pictures
2062000	2064000	Of me drawing the girls like way back
2064000	2066000	A couple of months ago now
2066000	2068000	Sadly life got in the way but
2068000	2070000	I actually do genuinely think if I ever hit
2070000	2072000	The Jenga with the five gifted
2072000	2074000	Memberships thank you
2074000	2076000	Congrats to those who caught it with your face
2076000	2078000	In your face
2078000	2080000	Sorry I'm really
2080000	2082000	If you didn't know there's a character called
2082000	2084000	Candy Roll in Kung Fu Chaos
2084000	2086000	Her and sweet and sour
2086000	2088000	Were my favourite characters
2088000	2090000	And when my voice gets squeaky
2090000	2092000	Internally, not externally
2092000	2094000	But internally because of the
2094000	2096000	You hear yourself differently
2096000	2098000	From out loud
2098000	2100000	I sound like Candy Roll
2100000	2102000	When I get really high pitched
2102000	2104000	And I
2104000	2106000	Know all her voice lines
2106000	2108000	Was it ekololalia
2108000	2110000	When you repeat what you've heard
2110000	2112000	And she's like
2112000	2114000	It's my candy ass
2114000	2116000	And I just love her so much
2116000	2118000	She's just like 10 out of 10 characters
2118000	2120000	Oh my god
2120000	2122000	Gen 2 roller skates confirmed
2122000	2124000	Sorry some sort of girl on roller skates
2124000	2126000	I don't care
2126000	2128000	Bimbo! Oh my god we don't have a bimbo
2128000	2130000	Wait
2130000	2132000	What would the bimbo be
2134000	2136000	Maybe like a bimbo that lowers your expectations
2136000	2138000	And then does something
2138000	2140000	Xenowarrier thank you for coming
2140000	2142000	Remember
2142000	2144000	Roller skates
2144000	2146000	A bimbo maid
2148000	2150000	I would need something a bit more than a maid
2150000	2152000	I feel like maid is very default
2154000	2156000	I don't know maid a bimbo maid
2156000	2158000	That is quite nice though
2158000	2160000	Bimbo maid is cute
2160000	2162000	Because then she can spell stuff
2162000	2164000	On you all the time
2164000	2166000	And then before you know
2166000	2168000	Bimbo
2168000	2170000	Possum
2170000	2172000	A possum mod
2172000	2174000	Remove this man's testicles
2174000	2176000	Possum
2176000	2178000	As in the thing in them that goes
2186000	2188000	Anonymous
2188000	2190000	I'm so conflicted about
2190000	2192000	Who is my favourite in VLR
2192000	2194000	Please hypnotise me to stay loyal
2194000	2196000	To you mummy
2196000	2198000	Keep that thought in mind
2198000	2200000	Not for what you think
2200000	2202000	Because next week
2202000	2204000	We may or may not be rating
2204000	2206000	A very unique audio roleplay
2206000	2208000	Paul Lott
2208000	2210000	That involves me and
2210000	2212000	The girls
2214000	2216000	Maybe that kind of script
2216000	2218000	Perhaps sea queen
2218000	2220000	Script
2220000	2222000	Might solidify
2222000	2224000	Who your choice is at VLR
2224000	2226000	Jealous mother
2226000	2228000	I assure you
2228000	2230000	I wish to share all
2230000	2232000	All the goodness
2232000	2234000	All the spice
2234000	2236000	I have clear ideas
2236000	2238000	A possum are kind of cute
2238000	2240000	A masochistic maid
2240000	2242000	Is meta
2242000	2244000	But it never goes out of meta
2244000	2246000	I was debating on when to get membership
2246000	2248000	And then I decided if it's not on the day
2248000	2250000	Strongly offers 50
2250000	2252000	Cent butt smashes
2252000	2254000	What day will it be?
2254000	2256000	Honestly do you think conventions would let us get away with that?
2258000	2260000	Like obviously I'll be wearing a mask
2260000	2262000	And I'll have a little wig
2262000	2264000	So my hair is the same
2264000	2266000	But I feel like no one can stop
2266000	2268000	You're like
2268000	2270000	Oh what are you going to do
2270000	2272000	A reefling lies down on the floor
2272000	2274000	And I quickly butt bash him and then get back up again
2274000	2276000	Is that kickable to get out of the corner
2276000	2278000	I feel like that's such a baby thing
2278000	2280000	Oops I tripped and landed on my reeflings face
2280000	2282000	No
2282000	2284000	It depends I guess
2284000	2286000	Because it would be really weird messaging
2286000	2288000	The convention and being like
2288000	2290000	Hey
2290000	2292000	Am I allowed to fall on the
2292000	2294000	Faces of reeflings
2294000	2296000	Question mark
2296000	2298000	Am I allowed... well if they allowed
2298000	2300000	Stepping because then you can start to argue
2300000	2302000	Like oh but you allow other
2302000	2304000	VTubers to step on them
2304000	2306000	Did you know that is also vexally
2306000	2308000	Besifying
2308000	2310000	When I trip and fall on a reeflings face
2310000	2312000	With my
2312000	2314000	Arse
2314000	2316000	That's unacceptable
2316000	2318000	But if I step on them that's acceptable
2318000	2320000	Oh my god
2320000	2322000	Convention
2322000	2324000	Talk about having double sided
2324000	2326000	Is it because I'm Scottish
2326000	2328000	Convention
2328000	2330000	You can't do that
2330000	2332000	You can't show that you
2332000	2334000	Believe in the British Isles
2334000	2336000	Sorry
2336000	2338000	You need Kingdom over
2338000	2340000	Scotland
2340000	2342000	Oh my god convention
2342000	2344000	You don't believe in the independence of
2344000	2346000	Scotland
2346000	2348000	Convention
2348000	2350000	You can't say that stuff out loud
2350000	2352000	Yeah
2352000	2354000	Albuphobia
2354000	2356000	Sounds like asking for trouble
2356000	2358000	Well good thing my name is
2358000	2360000	Johnny because we're making it double
2360000	2362000	That's right me out
2362000	2364000	Sorry I was kind of going on
2364000	2366000	Team rockets
2366000	2368000	Blasting off again
2368000	2370000	Oh wait that's not what they sound like
2370000	2372000	That sounded like cream
2372000	2374000	Please be careful not to fall
2374000	2376000	What
2376000	2378000	As
2378000	2380000	Team rockets
2380000	2382000	Blasting off again
2382000	2384000	It's kind of there
2384000	2386000	Yeah
2386000	2388000	Convention what do you mean
2388000	2390000	So there's a possibility
2390000	2392000	In a certain timeline
2392000	2394000	Um
2394000	2396000	I may or may not be able to
2396000	2398000	Make it to our convention
2398000	2400000	Um
2400000	2402000	I would love to do that
2402000	2404000	But the only problem is
2404000	2406000	We have a bomb
2406000	2408000	And I'd actually need to hire
2408000	2410000	A bodyguard two bodyguards
2410000	2412000	Or one bodyguard
2412000	2414000	Bro I'm going to be so embarrassed
2414000	2416000	Messaging security is like
2416000	2418000	A private security comment being like
2418000	2420000	Hey I basically need
2420000	2422000	Security persons to follow me
2422000	2424000	Around a convention is that fine
2424000	2426000	Like for bodyguard
2426000	2428000	Well I feel like the reeflings
2428000	2430000	Would bodyguard me pretty much
2430000	2432000	So like any shitters would like you know
2432000	2434000	Get eaten up
2434000	2436000	I thought this thumbnail said
2436000	2438000	Backshot bro you've been on the
2438000	2440000	Patreon a lot too much
2440000	2442000	Okay that bodyguard on me
2442000	2444000	Three four four is quite a lot
2444000	2446000	Four is because you're Scottish
2446000	2448000	Nearly
2450000	2452000	Nearly even
2452000	2454000	United with the UK
2454000	2456000	Five might be a good number
2456000	2458000	Five little reeflings
2458000	2460000	And a paycheck's a paycheck
2460000	2462000	Literally
2462000	2464000	The bodyguards
2464000	2466000	Just watching me like sit on everyone's
2466000	2468000	face
2468000	2470000	Being like what have I been hired for
2470000	2472000	I thought it was a convention for like
2472000	2474000	Weaves or something
2474000	2476000	Like not understanding this like for Retubers
2476000	2478000	We probably
2478000	2480000	Get weirder requests
2480000	2482000	plausible
2482000	2484000	True blood reeflings would be natural
2484000	2486000	Bodyguards
2486000	2488000	I think I would have to hire professional
2488000	2490000	Security
2490000	2492000	Yeah no that's not the plan
2492000	2494000	A sniper too steady
2494000	2496000	I'm not trying to take anyone's heats off
2496000	2498000	Okay and what is this
2498000	2500000	France when Star Wars got released
2500000	2502000	Did you know
2502000	2504000	That in France when Star Wars got released
2504000	2506000	Was the last public beheading
2506000	2508000	Hmm
2508000	2510000	What if they are also reeflings
2510000	2512000	The bodyguards I don't think bodyguards
2512000	2514000	With a full time job have enough time
2514000	2516000	To listen to me Japanese
2516000	2518000	About anything and everything
2518000	2520000	That comes to my head
2520000	2522000	What yeah it's true
2522000	2524000	The year that Star Wars came out
2524000	2526000	Which is
2526000	2528000	Nineteen
2528000	2530000	Seven
2530000	2532000	What year did first
2532000	2534000	Star Wars come
2534000	2536000	I don't know
2538000	2540000	1977
2540000	2542000	Was the last year there was a public execution
2542000	2544000	In France and also just happens to be
2544000	2546000	The year that Star Wars first came out
2546000	2548000	Leaving yeah
2548000	2550000	I've been at hold
2552000	2554000	I have a full time job
2554000	2556000	I can hear you yapping and so why not
2556000	2558000	How though aren't you getting distracted at work
2560000	2562000	Can I give you a bone bone at work
2562000	2564000	When we do the ASMR stream please
2566000	2568000	The thought I have that kind of power
2568000	2570000	It's too much power
2570000	2572000	Unlimited power
2572000	2574000	Speaking of Star Wars
2574000	2576000	Unlimited power
2576000	2578000	I was freaked me out that scene
2578000	2580000	You have done that to me at work
2580000	2582000	Yeah stop you're gonna give me an ego
2582000	2584000	It's like one of my favourite freaking concepts
2586000	2588000	Oh my god should I write
2588000	2590000	A joystick
2590000	2592000	About doing it at work
2592000	2594000	And being subtle
2594000	2596000	No I don't want you to get fired
2596000	2598000	I don't want to encourage such behaviours
2598000	2600000	I'd rather you didn't get fired
2600000	2602000	As much as you may despise
2602000	2604000	Work as a whole
2604000	2606000	It's good for routine for the brain
2606000	2608000	It's good for socialisation
2608000	2610000	It's good for keeping you active
2610000	2612000	And the neurons firing
2614000	2616000	Maybe capitalism won a little bit there
2616000	2618000	But maybe reduce it to a four day work week
2620000	2622000	A four day work week
2622000	2624000	And not putting it up to ten hours
2624000	2626000	Because that's outrageous
2626000	2628000	And then for those
2628000	2630000	Who choose to not
2630000	2632000	Those who work on Friday, Saturday, Sunday
2632000	2634000	Get a cheeky bit of overtime as well
2634000	2636000	Because that's not common in all countries
2638000	2640000	Anyway before the tinfoil hat goes back on
2640000	2642000	What it's been 44 minutes already
2642000	2644000	Guys why didn't you tell me to start the game
2646000	2648000	Are you squidding me right now
2650000	2652000	You and the rest of the girls
2652000	2654000	Sheepy goes live in T-Main
2654000	2656000	And we're in five
2656000	2658000	Showing her thighs and feet
2658000	2660000	I have taken so long and been so
2660000	2662000	Distracted
2662000	2664000	Let's turn on this desktop audio
2664000	2666000	So you guys can hear what I hear
2666000	2668000	And let me turn off my
2668000	2670000	Background theme
2670000	2672000	This is what I hear in buckshot
2672000	2674000	Okay we're just going to jump into it
2674000	2676000	Hopefully that's not too loud
2676000	2678000	Testing
2678000	2680000	Let's get my schedule off stream
2680000	2682000	We know what schedule is
2682000	2684000	We're very thankful
2684000	2686000	It's been 45 minutes, start the game
2686000	2688000	Oh now you tell me
2688000	2690000	I might have to
2690000	2692000	Put brightness up
2692000	2694000	I noticed that in my Crash Bandicoot stream
2694000	2696000	The brightness was so not bright
2696000	2698000	But on my screens it was bright
2698000	2700000	Hold on, hydration
2700000	2702000	V-B-N-Y
2702000	2704000	V-N-N-Four
2708000	2710000	Hold the scape tag
2712000	2714000	Oh
2714000	2716000	Oh my god
2716000	2718000	We're Germans
2718000	2720000	Germans like to rave
2720000	2722000	Abandoned buildings for some reason
2722000	2724000	Can I get a light mate?
2724000	2726000	Are you got anything on you?
2726000	2728000	Are you got a wee baggie on you?
2728000	2730000	No right, we'll just keep going then
2734000	2736000	Please sign the waiver
2738000	2740000	What's my name?
2740000	2742000	Oh my god my name is
2742000	2744000	Ah
2744000	2746000	Ne
2748000	2750000	That's me
2750000	2752000	That's you
2752000	2754000	Dealer
2754000	2756000	Anon
2756000	2758000	One live round, two blanks
2762000	2764000	I insert the shells
2764000	2766000	In an unknown order
2768000	2770000	Oh my god this back
2770000	2772000	Like the faded out background music
2772000	2774000	Shotgun, shooting yourself with a blank
2774000	2776000	Skips the dealer's turn
2780000	2782000	If there's two blanks
2782000	2784000	I shoot myself
2788000	2790000	Okay, okay, okay, statistically
2790000	2792000	We're now at 50-50
2792000	2794000	We're at 50-50
2794000	2796000	I'd rather give it to him
2796000	2798000	Shooting yourself
2798000	2800000	No, I want to shoot him, how do I do that?
2802000	2804000	I shoot the dealer, 50-50
2804000	2806000	I'm sorry mate
2808000	2810000	Oh no
2810000	2812000	Oh no, he's gonna
2818000	2820000	A defibrillator
2820000	2822000	Careful now
2822000	2824000	Defit
2824000	2826000	Alive
2826000	2828000	Three rounds, two blanks
2828000	2830000	Odds are what?
2832000	2834000	They enter the chamber in a hidden sequence
2836000	2838000	Free live
2838000	2840000	I want to shoot, sorry
2840000	2842000	Three live, two blank
2844000	2846000	Okay, now it's 50-50
2846000	2848000	Two live, two blank
2852000	2854000	Mmm
2856000	2858000	Okay, okay, that's good, that's good
2858000	2860000	Cause now it's two live, one blank
2860000	2862000	Okay

2866000	2868000	You're lucky
2868000	2870000	I left you with a charge
2870000	2872000	Get up and on
2872000	2874000	The knight is young
2874000	2876000	Do you want this?
2876000	2878000	Okay
2878000	2880000	Do I need to turn the brightness up on stream?
2882000	2884000	So
2884000	2886000	The game
2886000	2888000	Is it bright enough for you guys?
2888000	2890000	Sorry, I'm gonna read chat
2890000	2892000	No, it's good, it's good, okay, thank you
2892000	2894000	I don't know why, but Crash Bandicoot was so dark
2902000	2904000	Wait, is he the one that raised me then?
2904000	2906000	Oh
2910000	2912000	Welcome back
2912000	2914000	Hi
2916000	2918000	I thought this game took like 20 minutes to
2920000	2922000	One live round, two blanks
2922000	2924000	Okay, the odds are in my favor
2924000	2926000	For a blank, so I'm gonna
2926000	2928000	Myself
2930000	2932000	Oh, okay
2932000	2934000	Okay, safe, safe, and then again
2934000	2936000	The 50, surely I wouldn't lose
2936000	2938000	The 50-50 the second time around
2940000	2942000	BLEET! BLEET!
2942000	2944000	Are you serious?
2944000	2946000	Are you serious?
2946000	2948000	What the heck? I thought this was an easy game
2952000	2954000	Careful now
2956000	2958000	Oh goodness me
2958000	2960000	Right, three live, two blank
2962000	2964000	I
2964000	2966000	Used up all my luck on my daughters
2966000	2968000	That's what's happened
2968000	2970000	Three live, shoot the dealer
2978000	2980000	Okay, the game is feeling kind
2980000	2982000	Because there's now two live
2982000	2984000	And one blank
2986000	2988000	The game is trying to let me win now
2988000	2990000	I'm just gonna keep shooting
2990000	2992000	Okay, okay, we did it
2992000	2994000	We did it, we did it
2994000	2996000	See, I do not gamble
2996000	2998000	I have absolutely no
2998000	3000000	Interesting gamble
3000000	3002000	And on which you won, replaying

3008000	3010000	Interesting
3010000	3012000	Sorry, I'm getting comfy on my chair
3012000	3014000	I'm sitting on my toes
3014000	3016000	Two items each
3016000	3018000	More items before every load
3018000	3020000	This is my kind of game
3022000	3024000	Oh, sheebie!
3024000	3026000	You didn't tell me you were a part of this game
3026000	3028000	Sheebie!
3028000	3030000	You do not, sheebie
3032000	3034000	Four

3036000	3038000	Yeah
3038000	3040000	So what do you do?
3040000	3042000	Dealer
3042000	3044000	Skips the next
3044000	3046000	turn
3046000	3048000	Does that mean if I sheebie him up?
3052000	3054000	So I can just
3054000	3056000	Shoot both of them and win
3056000	3058000	Yeah
3058000	3060000	And then I get to shoot again
3060000	3062000	Okay, yeah, yeah
3062000	3064000	I'm getting it, I'm getting it
3064000	3066000	I'm getting it, so we win
3066000	3068000	Take that
3068000	3070000	Okay
3074000	3076000	Okay, now what?
3076000	3078000	Oh, I get more items every round
3078000	3080000	Okay, you should come front
3080000	3082000	Be your
3084000	3086000	Meh!
3086000	3088000	What was that? No, no, no, come back out
3088000	3090000	What was that? It said God
3090000	3092000	A magnifying glass
3092000	3094000	What was that? It said God
3094000	3096000	Two
3096000	3098000	Oh, it's a 50-50 again
3098000	3100000	What does beer do?
3102000	3104000	Racks the shotgun
3104000	3106000	Ejects current shell
3108000	3110000	Racks the shotgun
3114000	3116000	Check the current
3116000	3118000	Round in the chamber
3118000	3120000	Whoa!
3120000	3122000	It's a blank
3122000	3124000	So I'll shoot me
3124000	3126000	Rack equals pump
3126000	3128000	I'll pump you in a minute
3128000	3130000	Don't worry
3130000	3132000	I don't know if that means the same
3132000	3134000	But in Scots that means I'm gonna do you
3136000	3138000	Okay
3140000	3142000	Well, I did a blank
3142000	3144000	So two to one
3146000	3148000	Okay, okay
3148000	3150000	Oh, poor dealer
3150000	3152000	He's going down, but I don't wish
3152000	3154000	him any ill will
3154000	3156000	He just looks creepy, but I don't
3156000	3158000	He's taking a cigarette
3158000	3160000	You know, a cigarette
3160000	3162000	What? Cigarettes are bad for your health
3164000	3166000	To health?
3176000	3178000	Bro
3182000	3184000	He heals up
3184000	3186000	and does double damage to me
3188000	3190000	You wet fart
3190000	3192000	Release me
3194000	3196000	Oh, I've lost this
3196000	3198000	I don't know what kind of
3198000	3200000	I don't know what kind of
3200000	3202000	stuff be going on
3202000	3204000	Sure, I'll take that and that
3204000	3206000	Why not?
3206000	3208000	Two blanks
3208000	3210000	Three live
3210000	3212000	I'll win in this one
3212000	3214000	Oh
3214000	3216000	This is such a creative game though
3216000	3218000	I'll give it though, I like this
3218000	3220000	It's live
3220000	3222000	Well, you'll never guess who I'm shooting
3226000	3228000	That's so satisfying
3230000	3232000	I like how it's not too loud either
3232000	3234000	Do I need to lower in-game volume or it's all good to go
3234000	3236000	Again
3240000	3242000	Okay
3242000	3244000	It's fine, all good
3244000	3246000	Okay, okay
3246000	3248000	Oh, can I do multiple items per round?
3248000	3250000	Wow
3250000	3252000	I got two blanks, the game's feeling nice to me
3252000	3254000	Right, I think I can just shoot him
3254000	3256000	because there's only one left and it's live
3256000	3258000	Yeah, take that
3258000	3260000	You wet fart
3260000	3262000	Okay, we're back on an even
3262000	3264000	plain field
3264000	3266000	Okay, what items
3266000	3268000	What items
3268000	3270000	What a curious game
3270000	3272000	God
3272000	3274000	Okay, all I'm getting is handcuffs and beer
3276000	3278000	50-50, right
3278000	3280000	Right, I'll handcuff him
3282000	3284000	Um, please take these
3284000	3286000	handcuffs
3286000	3288000	Oh, it's a harem
3288000	3290000	Eject the current shell
3290000	3292000	It's 50-50, this will change the odds
3292000	3294000	out of 50-50
3294000	3296000	Shit!
3296000	3298000	The odds are more likely it's a live round
3300000	3302000	Oh, we're doing it
3302000	3304000	We're doing it, we have probability
3304000	3306000	Okay
3306000	3308000	Now it's likely to be blank
3308000	3310000	because the odds are now
3310000	3312000	one live to two blank
3312000	3314000	or three blank
3314000	3316000	Oh, I don't like this part
3316000	3318000	Okay, okay, it's fine
3318000	3320000	It's fine
3320000	3322000	Right, and now
3322000	3324000	it's again back to being live
3324000	3326000	Unless
3326000	3328000	put the gun down
3328000	3330000	I can't change my mind
3330000	3332000	Live
3332000	3334000	No!
3334000	3336000	I'm not going to make every blanks
3340000	3342000	Oh, he knows what's inside
3342000	3344000	Very interesting
3348000	3350000	Yeah, I'm not surprised
3350000	3352000	I'm not surprised
3352000	3354000	It's a 1v1
3354000	3356000	Careful now
3358000	3360000	Oh no
3362000	3364000	I don't know what, I don't even
3364000	3366000	I genuinely
3366000	3368000	do not know what's in this
3368000	3370000	There's no point in racking the shell
3370000	3372000	Is there?
3372000	3374000	Cuff him, everyone says cuff him
3374000	3376000	Right, I'll listen to the replays because you guys are smart
3376000	3378000	Right, I've cuffed him
3378000	3380000	And then I'm gonna
3382000	3384000	Okay
3386000	3388000	Oh, I just ended the round
3390000	3392000	Yes, I'll absolutely take that
3392000	3394000	Oh, and the Sugi
3394000	3396000	Giyazawi
3396000	3398000	Whoa, the odds are
3398000	3400000	very high for a live round
3400000	3402000	Sorry
3402000	3404000	Look, I'm not this smart, it's right
3404000	3406000	Regain a charge, I'll have a wee puff puff
3406000	3408000	Puff puff puff
3408000	3410000	Yes, nicotine
3410000	3412000	No, it's not good, don't ever
3412000	3414000	actually do it
3414000	3416000	A blank, right, okay
3416000	3418000	Okay, okay, me
3420000	3422000	Okay, that's good to go
3422000	3424000	Okay, so now it's like 5 to 1
3426000	3428000	We're just gonna shoot
3430000	3432000	What a curious game
3432000	3434000	I'm very intrigued by this
3434000	3436000	I'm intrigued by the dev team
3436000	3438000	I'm intrigued by the graph
3438000	3440000	You won, Refling!
3440000	3442000	And on one
3442000	3444000	Yeah
3444000	3446000	Long last, we arrive at the final showdown
3448000	3450000	No more defibrillators
3450000	3452000	No more blood transfusions
3452000	3454000	Now me and you, we are dancing
3454000	3456000	on the edge of life and death
3458000	3460000	Eh
3464000	3466000	Eh
3468000	3470000	Eh
3474000	3476000	Four items each
3476000	3478000	Handcuff
3478000	3480000	Handcuff
3480000	3482000	Magnifying glass, handcuff
3482000	3484000	I'm starting to forget about the feet
3486000	3488000	Eh, you know the drill
3488000	3490000	Is he gonna handcuff me?
3494000	3496000	If I handcuff him
3496000	3498000	I can double
3498000	3500000	I can double shoot
3500000	3502000	and the odds are he's gonna get shot
3504000	3506000	Okay, there you go
3506000	3508000	Okay, we're doing it, we're doing it
3510000	3512000	Doesn't tell you what his health actually is
3512000	3514000	So he's
3514000	3516000	So we can just double
3516000	3518000	Oh no, they're both blank, aren't they?
3518000	3520000	Ah, yeah
3520000	3522000	Wait, no
3522000	3524000	Oh no
3526000	3528000	I messed up, hold on
3534000	3536000	Yeah, okay, right
3536000	3538000	Fresh start and two new items
3538000	3540000	What we get, what we get
3540000	3542000	Show me the money, we got beer
3542000	3544000	More handcuffs
3544000	3546000	Oh, a beer
3546000	3548000	More handcuffs
3550000	3552000	Four live, four blank
3552000	3554000	50-50
3560000	3562000	Handcuff
3564000	3566000	That gives me two in a row
3568000	3570000	Eject one to make
3570000	3572000	seven on the board
3574000	3576000	Odds are live
3578000	3580000	Blank
3582000	3584000	Two blank remaining
3584000	3586000	Four live, odds are
3586000	3588000	Shoot, shoot, shoot
3590000	3592000	Shoot, shoot, shoot
3592000	3594000	One
3594000	3596000	Blank
3596000	3598000	Four live
3598000	3600000	Wow
3602000	3604000	Can't give him that
3604000	3606000	Can eject again
3606000	3608000	Wait, no, wait
3608000	3610000	What did I just do, sorry, eject
3610000	3612000	Live, three live, one blank
3612000	3614000	Shoot
3614000	3616000	Yeah
3618000	3620000	Cuff him, oh could I have cuffed there?
3620000	3622000	No, he's still cuffed
3622000	3624000	Okay, now he's uncuffed
3624000	3626000	He's gonna eject
3626000	3628000	Two live, one blank
3628000	3630000	Oh, handcuff though
3630000	3632000	Health revivals
3636000	3638000	Eject to live
3638000	3640000	Two live remaining
3640000	3642000	Son of double for two health
3642000	3644000	No
3644000	3646000	Three health total taken
3646000	3648000	Out of two live
3650000	3652000	This game is good
3656000	3658000	This game is good
3660000	3662000	Oh, I like this game
3662000	3664000	Hold on
3666000	3668000	Okay, we got health
3668000	3670000	We got a peak, we got two peaks
3670000	3672000	A health and a cuff
3672000	3674000	Three live, two blank
3676000	3678000	Okay
3680000	3682000	We're gonna cuff
3682000	3684000	We're gonna heal
3686000	3688000	We're gonna heal
3688000	3690000	Because we do need a cheeky bit health
3690000	3692000	Because it is
3692000	3694000	Three live, two blank
3696000	3698000	Do we take a peak or do we
3698000	3700000	Wait, no, just taking a peak
3700000	3702000	Matter if he's cuffed
3702000	3704000	Well, because yeah
3704000	3706000	Doesn't matter
3706000	3708000	No, it doesn't
3708000	3710000	That's what
3710000	3712000	Two blank
3712000	3714000	Oh, dear
3716000	3718000	Oh, dear
3718000	3720000	Doesn't matter if he's cuffed
3720000	3722000	Doesn't matter what the results are
3722000	3724000	I've already forgotten what we're at
3724000	3726000	Is it one live, two blank
3726000	3728000	Or two live, one blank
3728000	3730000	He's got two heals on the board
3730000	3732000	And he's got double son off
3734000	3736000	Now it's two live, one blank
3736000	3738000	Sugar didoo
3738000	3740000	Yeah, he's gonna shoot me
3740000	3742000	No, for two health
3742000	3744000	He's gonna shoot me for the son off
3744000	3746000	Oh, this is
3746000	3748000	My odds
3748000	3750000	Gosh
3750000	3752000	Wow, hopefully
3752000	3754000	I can get some cigarettes
3758000	3760000	Right
3760000	3762000	Cuff
3762000	3764000	Wait, why cuff?
3764000	3766000	It's two blank now
3768000	3770000	It's two blank now
3770000	3772000	Yeah, so why
3772000	3774000	Shouldn't have cuffed
3774000	3776000	Remaining ammo
3776000	3778000	Zero, they're both blank
3780000	3782000	What
3782000	3784000	I'm not right, I need to focus up
3784000	3786000	I'm getting, I need a piece of paper or something
3788000	3790000	Maybe there won't be one
3790000	3792000	Right, items, cuffs
3792000	3794000	Peak, peak
3794000	3796000	And oh, we've got a double son off
3796000	3798000	If we peak, we could get a double
3798000	3800000	We could get a double
3800000	3802000	Four to two
3802000	3804000	Four
3804000	3806000	To two
3808000	3810000	Cuff him
3812000	3814000	Let me know what's going on under the hood
3818000	3820000	Let me double up the damage under the hood
3822000	3824000	Beautiful
3824000	3826000	Let us acquire two HP damage
3828000	3830000	Oh
3832000	3834000	That's fine
3834000	3836000	So now we are three live
3836000	3838000	Two blank
3840000	3842000	Now it is a two in three
3848000	3850000	Oh dear
3852000	3854000	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear
3858000	3860000	Oh, he just released the blank
3862000	3864000	Oh no
3864000	3866000	Oh no, this can't be
3866000	3868000	This can't be
3870000	3872000	Oh dear
3872000	3874000	I am on life support
3874000	3876000	I believe there's
3876000	3878000	Unless that's it, I don't know
3878000	3880000	There's two on
3880000	3882000	Okay
3882000	3884000	Well, I'm handcuffed
3884000	3886000	He's won
3886000	3888000	I've lost the odds game
3888000	3890000	Oh no
3890000	3892000	Strummer bad, I'm handcuffed
3892000	3894000	Are you ready?
3894000	3896000	Yeah
3900000	3902000	Well, I can
3904000	3906000	Hopefully there's a heal
3906000	3908000	Double damage
3908000	3910000	Double damage
3910000	3912000	Double damage
3912000	3914000	Aww, what are these?
3914000	3916000	Oh, live, live, live, live
3916000	3918000	Five live, three
3918000	3920000	Goodness
3920000	3922000	Me, heals don't work anymore
3922000	3924000	Oh, you can't even heal anymore
3924000	3926000	Oh, that's why the game's giving me
3926000	3928000	Triple damage, right? Let's see what I'm working with
3930000	3932000	Blank
3932000	3934000	What was it?
3934000	3936000	Five to three, so now it's five to two
3940000	3942000	And then
3942000	3944000	We'll just check again
3944000	3946000	Okay, live
3946000	3948000	And then we'll do double damage
3950000	3952000	Unfortunately, the odds
3952000	3954000	Are not in our favor
3954000	3956000	But hey ho, so that's four
3956000	3958000	To two
3960000	3962000	You're not gonna make it
3962000	3964000	Unless he throws
3964000	3966000	We ain't gonna make it
3968000	3970000	Oh wait, what?
3970000	3972000	Oh
3972000	3974000	Oh, wait
3974000	3976000	Are you saying there's a chance?
3976000	3978000	If it's in the chamber
3978000	3980000	Are you saying there's a chance?
3990000	3992000	Against all odds?
4000000	4002000	I
4010000	4012000	What'd I do with it?
4014000	4016000	Oh my gosh

4074000	4076000	The visuals, the direction
4076000	4078000	Do we go again?
4080000	4082000	Do we go again?
4082000	4084000	Double or nothing? How did I do double or nothing?
4084000	4086000	Is it just start?
4088000	4090000	Just start
4090000	4092000	Start then click the pill bowl
4094000	4096000	Wow
4096000	4098000	It's changed
4098000	4100000	Because of our progress
4100000	4102000	I'll click the pill bowl
4102000	4104000	Consume pills
4104000	4106000	May impair your ability to drive
4106000	4108000	But reeflings, I don't want you to go
4112000	4114000	Consume the double or nothing
4116000	4118000	Oh no the guy's gone
4124000	4126000	Bye strongy, no reefling no more
4128000	4130000	Please sign the waiver
4130000	4132000	Yes
4134000	4136000	I am blown away by this game
4138000	4140000	Sorry, wait I know how to spell your name
4140000	4142000	Sorry, sorry
4142000	4144000	Sorry I didn't mean to misspell it
4144000	4146000	It was a genuine mistake
4152000	4154000	Double damage
4154000	4156000	Handcuff
4156000	4158000	Mobile phone
4158000	4160000	What are you?
4162000	4164000	One live to blank
4164000	4166000	I
4168000	4170000	A mysterious voice gives you insight
4170000	4172000	From the future
4174000	4176000	Swap the polarity
4180000	4182000	I think we'll just cuff and double shoot
4184000	4186000	If the both of the blanks happen to be in there
4186000	4188000	Wow I have rubbish luck
4190000	4192000	Okay that's fine
4192000	4194000	Now it's a 50-50
4194000	4196000	If I shoot a blank at him I'm going to be
4196000	4198000	Should I go all
4198000	4200000	Oh I'll tell you
4204000	4206000	Okay rough start
4206000	4208000	Double or nothing, rough start
4208000	4210000	Oh he's double starting
4210000	4212000	Now it's a rough start
4216000	4218000	Jeez I've got
4218000	4220000	Two health already
4220000	4222000	He's got a health upload
4222000	4224000	Smokes as well
4224000	4226000	Hydration check
4230000	4232000	Okay we can pump one out of the chamber
4232000	4234000	We can heal and we can swap
4234000	4236000	Oh another polarity
4236000	4238000	Wow okay interesting curious
4238000	4240000	Again
4240000	4242000	With a blank
4242000	4244000	I am going to pump one out of the chamber
4246000	4248000	To see what the odds are
4248000	4250000	Okay now it's 50-50
4250000	4252000	So I'm going to heal up
4252000	4254000	Because we already know what's going to happen
4256000	4258000	And then we're going to
4258000	4260000	Sol it off
4260000	4262000	And we're going all in on
4262000	4264000	Double damage against him
4266000	4268000	Dealer
4268000	4270000	Use the phone
4274000	4276000	Right I'll use the phone
4276000	4278000	The phone about the current round or the next round
4280000	4282000	Oh my god he's doing double damage
4282000	4284000	Against me
4284000	4286000	That's so bad
4286000	4288000	Right I'll do the phone, my apologies
4288000	4290000	I thought the phone was like for the next round
4290000	4292000	Careful now
4292000	4294000	Careful refling
4294000	4296000	Wouldn't want to be dancing
4296000	4298000	Death row
4300000	4302000	Let's see you
4302000	4304000	What is you
4304000	4306000	Okay
4306000	4308000	Let's ring ring
4308000	4310000	Hello
4310000	4312000	Three lie four blank
4312000	4314000	The game is trying its best to help me right now
4314000	4316000	A mysterious voice
4326000	4328000	How smart do you think
4328000	4330000	I am reflings
4330000	4332000	To be able to retain
4332000	4334000	Information that on the sixth
4334000	4336000	Shell it's blank
4340000	4342000	How smart do you think I am
4342000	4344000	What is this a pipe bomb
4344000	4346000	Steal an item
4346000	4348000	And use it
4348000	4350000	Well
4350000	4352000	Oh no
4352000	4354000	Oh that's exactly what happens
4354000	4356000	They put adrenaline directly into
4356000	4358000	Your bloodstream
4358000	4360000	What was that medicine box
4360000	4362000	I wonder what this is
4362000	4364000	I don't have it yet
4364000	4366000	There's nothing I can do
4370000	4372000	Are those in coffin and double shoot
4380000	4382000	That also means the fifth isn't going to be blank
4382000	4384000	Are those going to be blank
4388000	4390000	I just need to send it
4390000	4392000	Sorry I can't
4392000	4394000	No okay
4394000	4396000	So it means these next few are alive
4396000	4398000	Gotta go straight to coffin
4398000	4400000	Meet
4400000	4402000	Okay
4404000	4406000	Okay I've definitely messed up this one
4408000	4410000	What is that
4410000	4412000	A medicine packet
4412000	4414000	He takes a pill
4414000	4416000	Aw healed
4416000	4418000	Okay that's fine cigarette or pills healed
4418000	4420000	Oh no
4422000	4424000	I've lost
4424000	4426000	I've lost
4426000	4428000	Oh no

4430000	4432000	Literally I get
4432000	4434000	Aw that's such a shame
4434000	4436000	Wait
4436000	4438000	He put the polarising effect on
4440000	4442000	Oh no I'm gone
4442000	4444000	Sorry
4444000	4446000	Sorry sorry
4446000	4448000	I didn't know how the phone worked
4448000	4450000	Not that it probably would have helped
4450000	4452000	Oh by the way the sixth one's a blank
4452000	4454000	Aw thanks for that mate
4454000	4456000	Let me just add it into my fucking calculator
4456000	4458000	Have the largest IQ
4458000	4460000	My brain goes three sides
4460000	4462000	You know the average person who can only retain
4462000	4464000	Like freaking what
4464000	4466000	Four bits of information at a time
4466000	4468000	Like come on give me a chance game
4468000	4470000	Let me write it down
4470000	4472000	Give me a wee piece of paper and I'll write it down
4472000	4474000	Just like this
4480000	4482000	He kicked the hell out this cuttlefish
4482000	4484000	Literally I'm
4484000	4486000	Calamari right now
4486000	4488000	By all accounts right let's try that again
4488000	4490000	Pump one out the chamber
4490000	4492000	Adrenaline burst health and
4492000	4494000	Double damage okay
4494000	4496000	Okay we can work with this
4496000	4498000	Four report
4498000	4500000	Two live three blank
4502000	4504000	What do I do with that
4504000	4506000	Information
4506000	4508000	I don't know
4510000	4512000	If three blank should I shoot
4512000	4514000	Myself
4518000	4520000	Or should I make
4520000	4522000	The odds known if it's 50-50
4522000	4524000	Three blank two
4526000	4528000	50-50 double damage
4528000	4530000	Let's go
4530000	4532000	50-50 double damage
4532000	4534000	Two blanks in a row
4534000	4536000	Possibly
4536000	4538000	Oh yes
4538000	4540000	Okay
4540000	4542000	Okay
4544000	4546000	Okay
4548000	4550000	He's gonna pump it out
4550000	4552000	Now it's back to 50-50
4552000	4554000	I'm being cuffed but I do have a blank
4556000	4558000	Yep and then one health
4558000	4560000	Damage on me
4560000	4562000	Unless he wants to use the polarizing effect
4562000	4564000	And let me win
4564000	4566000	But that's slightly different
4566000	4568000	Okay that's good
4568000	4570000	Let him get up
4570000	4572000	Good shot
4572000	4574000	Are you squinting me right now

4592000	4594000	I think I'm gonna steal his health
4594000	4596000	Prevent him from healing up
4600000	4602000	Give me that
4602000	4604000	Give me that what does it do
4606000	4608000	Why did my head just
4610000	4612000	Two blank one live
4614000	4616000	Two blank one live
4624000	4626000	Medicine is 50% chance
4626000	4628000	One damage and two heal
4628000	4630000	Oh wait is that
4630000	4632000	You got the good pill if it's a bad pill you'll lose health
4632000	4634000	Oops
4634000	4636000	Okay we are classic 50-50
4636000	4638000	If we get this we have won the first round
4638000	4640000	Of double or nothing
4640000	4642000	Dealer
4644000	4646000	Oh that was a clean round
4646000	4648000	That was a clean
4648000	4650000	Round of odds
4650000	4652000	Very clean
4652000	4654000	And on win
4654000	4656000	Okay I'm not taking medicine again
4656000	4658000	Cause I didn't realise I could hurt myself
4658000	4660000	With it
4664000	4666000	Okay
4670000	4672000	Oh great fucking tiddlywink spawn

4680000	4682000	Full eight 50-50
4682000	4684000	Full eight
4688000	4690000	Remove one from the chamber let me know my odds

4728000	4730000	Six total four is live
4736000	4738000	So I have to
4738000	4740000	It's most likely a blank
4740000	4742000	You know that
4742000	4744000	If four is live in that sequence
4744000	4746000	There are most likely two blanks
4746000	4748000	Before it
4748000	4750000	Wait
4750000	4752000	Did I not take a heal

4826000	4828000	Please sign the waiver I consent
4840000	4842000	Your gacha look is not great
4842000	4844000	I've actually never played a gacha game
4846000	4848000	Calling a friend
4848000	4850000	Polarizing in the seat
4850000	4852000	Right I'm glad we can get a peek
4852000	4854000	Let's try this again

4888000	4890000	That mere moments ago
4890000	4892000	That you can't over heal in this game mode
4892000	4894000	And what do you do
4894000	4896000	Reade it over heal you could have had him down to two
4896000	4898000	You could have had him on the ropes
4898000	4900000	But no no
4900000	4902000	Okay 50-50 odds
4902000	4904000	He's getting insider knowledge
4904000	4906000	Did you know
4906000	4908000	The celebrities calling the paparazzi
4908000	4910000	To tell them ahead of time

4992000	4994000	It's 50-50
4994000	4996000	What you can do is call in a pow
5004000	5006000	It's 50-50
5006000	5008000	Let's give him the damage
5010000	5012000	Let's go let's re-inhale
5016000	5018000	When I said re-inhale
5018000	5020000	I didn't mean like
5020000	5022000	Wind, literally all he
5022000	5024000	Felt was low
5026000	5028000	Oh man
5028000	5030000	Alright so that's blank
5034000	5036000	Very interesting
5036000	5038000	What are you stealing
5038000	5040000	Give it back
5040000	5042000	Oh you can have that please hurt yourself with it
5042000	5044000	Oh
5050000	5052000	I'm gonna make it
5052000	5054000	I'm so bad at this game
5054000	5056000	Careful now
5056000	5058000	I'm trying to be careful
5058000	5060000	But I suck
5064000	5066000	Okay if I eject this one
5066000	5068000	This one's blank so I'm gonna shoot myself
5068000	5070000	I'm removing this one
5070000	5072000	The next one is blank
5072000	5074000	So I'm just gonna play it safe
5074000	5076000	And do that
5078000	5080000	He is using developer luck
5080000	5082000	Remaining ammo oh my god you guys
5082000	5084000	You're trying to help me so much I'm so bad
5084000	5086000	I'm so sorry
5086000	5088000	Right we can now double spawn off at least
5090000	5092000	Why did I get two turns in a room there
5096000	5098000	Well it's now even Steven
5098000	5100000	No it's not
5100000	5102000	He has two health and not one
5106000	5108000	What is he doing
5108000	5110000	Polarize him
5114000	5116000	What are you gonna do
5116000	5118000	No I'm so bad
5118000	5120000	Oh my goodness
5120000	5122000	This is so hard
5122000	5124000	Yes please
5126000	5128000	Let me try again
5128000	5130000	Let me get up let me get up let me
5130000	5132000	Be very afraid
5132000	5134000	The fourth was the blank
5134000	5136000	Yeah that's why I shot myself with it
5140000	5142000	Wow sorry this must be painful
5142000	5144000	I'm so sorry
5144000	5146000	Look I'm not very smart
5146000	5148000	You guys didn't figure out I wasn't smart
5148000	5150000	By playing connect 4 with me
5150000	5152000	Hang on
5152000	5154000	You know what
5156000	5158000	Yeah that's right
5158000	5160000	Call me big willy
5160000	5162000	Cause I got a big massive willy
5162000	5164000	One
5164000	5166000	Right
5166000	5168000	Let's try hard
5168000	5170000	It's time to try
5170000	5172000	I only got two items
5172000	5174000	Oh he only got two as well
5174000	5176000	Big willy
5176000	5178000	It's a 50-50 the game
5178000	5180000	Let's try again
5180000	5182000	If it's a 50-50 I could just win
5182000	5184000	By doing this
5190000	5192000	But he can do the save
5192000	5194000	To shoot me
5198000	5200000	But he can still hurt me
5202000	5204000	Cause the first one wasn't
5204000	5206000	Oh if you shoot yourself
5206000	5208000	You get to play a second turn
5212000	5214000	It's finally starting
5214000	5216000	To make a little bit of sense
5222000	5224000	But I can't over heal
5224000	5226000	So don't get jealous
5226000	5228000	Whoa why so many items
5228000	5230000	Oh he got loads of items too
5230000	5232000	Two life three blank
5236000	5238000	No
5252000	5254000	Three blank
5254000	5256000	No it's 50-50
5260000	5262000	No
5262000	5264000	It's
5264000	5266000	Oh god
5266000	5268000	I can't use my brain and talk at the same time
5268000	5270000	Just let me see what it is
5270000	5272000	Please
5272000	5274000	Okay
5274000	5276000	So if I shoot myself
5276000	5278000	I get to go again
5280000	5282000	And then I get to double shotgun
5282000	5284000	Barrel
5284000	5286000	You
5286000	5288000	Am I doing it?
5288000	5290000	Am I doing it? I think I'm doing it
5290000	5292000	I think I'm doing it
5294000	5296000	No
5296000	5298000	Why is my luck so poor
5300000	5302000	There's all life now
5306000	5308000	What does polarised do
5308000	5310000	You could have inverted
5310000	5312000	And then sawn for the win
5312000	5314000	Wait that works backwards as well
5316000	5318000	If I know it's blank
5318000	5320000	I need to polarise it to change it
5326000	5328000	This must be the most painful place
5328000	5330000	Or you've ever seen
5330000	5332000	I even think we're going to be able to do it
5332000	5334000	In time for Shibi's monetisation stream
5334000	5336000	Okay I didn't realise
5336000	5338000	Polarising swapped
5342000	5344000	Oh shit I did not pay attention
5344000	5346000	To how many live in
5346000	5348000	If I know it's a blank
5348000	5350000	Use polarising
5350000	5352000	Got it
5352000	5354000	If I know it's a blank use polarising
5354000	5356000	Okay it's alive
5356000	5358000	It's alive
5358000	5360000	So
5360000	5362000	I am going to
5362000	5364000	Steal your double damage
5366000	5368000	Steal his salt
5368000	5370000	Yes I'm stealing his double damage
5370000	5372000	If I know it's a blank
5372000	5374000	Polarise
5374000	5376000	If I know it's a blank
5376000	5378000	Polarise
5378000	5380000	If I know it's a blank
5380000	5382000	Polarise
5382000	5384000	You've already finished the game
5384000	5386000	This is infinite mode
5386000	5388000	Wait it's the same
5390000	5392000	Right he's on one health
5392000	5394000	He's going to sawn a friend
5394000	5396000	Which is fine
5396000	5398000	He's going to cuff me
5398000	5400000	Oh I'm zadding
5400000	5402000	Oh yeah you want to
5402000	5404000	cuff me up
5404000	5406000	Right he's healed
5406000	5408000	Which is fine we're no one even Steven
5408000	5410000	What was that
5410000	5412000	Adrenaline
5412000	5414000	He's healing again
5414000	5416000	Oh you greedy
5420000	5422000	Hello
5424000	5426000	Why would you do that
5426000	5428000	Question mark

5432000	5434000	Okay please
5434000	5436000	Take a xp
5436000	5438000	I hear a health down
5438000	5440000	Oh yeah
5440000	5442000	Oh no he's didn't polarise
5446000	5448000	Oh no
5448000	5450000	Oh no
5452000	5454000	Ow
5454000	5456000	Oh no
5456000	5458000	I don't know what it is
5458000	5460000	I don't know what's left
5460000	5462000	Oh I do know what's left
5466000	5468000	So if I blank myself
5470000	5472000	Oh polarise
5472000	5474000	Polarise you stupid women
5474000	5476000	Polarise
5476000	5478000	Polarise
5478000	5480000	Polarise to blank
5480000	5482000	Oh my god I was so
5482000	5484000	I freaking clicked it and my brain was like
5484000	5486000	Wait a minute you were supposed to do something
5486000	5488000	Freaking polarise
5490000	5492000	Ah
5494000	5496000	Okay give me give me give me
5496000	5498000	Give me give me yeah give me yeah
5498000	5500000	Give me yeah blank
5500000	5502000	Right 50-50
5504000	5506000	Okay 50-50
5506000	5508000	Inspect element
5508000	5510000	Inspect element blank
5510000	5512000	Blank found
5512000	5514000	Polarise effect
5514000	5516000	Added
5516000	5518000	Polarising
5518000	5520000	And then what shoot myself or shoot him
5520000	5522000	With polarise on
5524000	5526000	Shoot him with polarise on
5526000	5528000	Man she sure is pretty
5528000	5530000	Yeah that's all I got going for me
5530000	5532000	This feature of model is adorable
5532000	5534000	Okay shoot him
5536000	5538000	We did it I was so sorry
5542000	5544000	Shoot um right we did it
5544000	5546000	Willy wins fake Willy wins
5546000	5548000	Imagine if this is the run I went on
5548000	5550000	And it's the one I call myself Willy on
5550000	5552000	Right
5554000	5556000	Okay let's see what we're working with baby
5556000	5558000	Rejection calling
5558000	5560000	And focus right
5562000	5564000	For health on big Willy
5564000	5566000	50-50 odds okay
5566000	5568000	He can see he can cuff
5568000	5570000	And he can double damage
5572000	5574000	Maybe the phone
5574000	5576000	Can tell me if
5576000	5578000	What's first
5578000	5580000	If not I'll just use the magnifying glass
5582000	5584000	That's absolutely nothing
5584000	5586000	Can you not pick like
5586000	5588000	The second bullet so I'll actually remember
5588000	5590000	Right I don't have
5590000	5592000	Polarising so I can shoot myself for free
5596000	5598000	That's
5598000	5600000	One
5600000	5602000	So odds are
5602000	5604000	Shoot him
5606000	5608000	No
5608000	5610000	Are you f**king
5610000	5612000	Kidding me
5612000	5614000	High odds of
5614000	5616000	Being live
5616000	5618000	Literally the seventh shell is blank
5618000	5620000	So and two bullets
5620000	5622000	Have been utilised
5622000	5624000	This is the third bullet being utilised
5628000	5630000	Right
5632000	5634000	So
5636000	5638000	So the odds of this one being
5638000	5640000	Live are high
5640000	5642000	Again
5642000	5644000	Oh no
5644000	5646000	Okay
5646000	5648000	Is that four
5648000	5650000	Shots now
5650000	5652000	So then
5652000	5654000	Five and six are live
5658000	5660000	Five is live
5660000	5662000	So
5676000	5678000	Does this game want from me
5678000	5680000	What does this game want from me
5682000	5684000	My odds
5684000	5686000	I know you can't rely on odds
5686000	5688000	That's just how odds work
5688000	5690000	My odds are
5690000	5692000	Astronomically
5694000	5696000	Right Willy's definitely
5696000	5698000	We can't do it as Willy
5698000	5700000	We have to go back to our roots
5700000	5702000	We have to go back to Anon okay
5702000	5704000	Cause this clearly isn't working
5706000	5708000	It wants you to suffer
5708000	5710000	My poor Willy
5710000	5712000	My poor Willy got blown off
5712000	5714000	Right
5714000	5716000	I'm actually can
5716000	5718000	Pay for it
5718000	5720000	These are good items
5720000	5722000	What are the odds
5722000	5724000	Give me a 50-50
5724000	5726000	Okay
5726000	5728000	We've got a 50-50
5728000	5730000	I can't overheal past two which is fine
5730000	5732000	If it's
5732000	5734000	50
5734000	5736000	50
5738000	5740000	Let me see
5740000	5742000	What's
5742000	5744000	Or eject
5744000	5746000	I might be able to
5746000	5748000	Eject 50-50
5748000	5750000	and tell me what's up
5750000	5752000	Right taking it out alive
5752000	5754000	So if we're gonna get a blank we're gonna steal the polarizing
5754000	5756000	No it's live
5756000	5758000	We actually don't have a double
5758000	5760000	Oh sugar but he has
5760000	5762000	the polarizing
5768000	5770000	Well the next to her blank
5770000	5772000	So if he uses polarizing
5772000	5774000	Then he's one
5774000	5776000	I think
5776000	5778000	No he can only do one damage to me
5778000	5780000	This round
5780000	5782000	Okay okay
5782000	5784000	Steal the cuffs
5786000	5788000	I don't think that would have
5788000	5790000	Oh Andy's healing
5790000	5792000	Bro
5792000	5794000	Bro this is not looking good
5794000	5796000	Why is this game so hard
5796000	5798000	I just need you guys to like
5798000	5800000	Send me your gaming fridge
5800000	5802000	Cause this is getting so bad
5802000	5804000	Careful now
5804000	5806000	All I've been told this game is careful now
5806000	5808000	Careful now
5808000	5810000	Careful now
5812000	5814000	Yeah yeah yeah they're both blank
5814000	5816000	We know
5816000	5818000	We know they're blank
5818000	5820000	Well at least I have a cigarette
5824000	5826000	Right
5826000	5828000	Two live three blank
5828000	5830000	But he doesn't have a polarizing
5830000	5832000	So blank actually means blank in this game
5836000	5838000	I'm gonna steal his cigarette
5838000	5840000	No
5842000	5844000	Can I get a vase
5844000	5846000	Three blank two live
5846000	5848000	Can I get a vase
5850000	5852000	So the three blank are up ahead
5854000	5856000	So odds are this is blank
5858000	5860000	Can I steal his health
5864000	5866000	I don't want him to heal
5870000	5872000	Yeah this is blank
5872000	5874000	It's my guess
5876000	5878000	Right this is blank sorry I'm guessing
5878000	5880000	But yeah okay odds are
5880000	5882000	Yeah
5882000	5884000	Right I'm happy with that
5884000	5886000	Right we're gonna take a peek
5888000	5890000	Blank again
5890000	5892000	Wow
5894000	5896000	And then the rest are
5896000	5898000	Live two live in a room
5898000	5900000	Well unfortunately he's gonna get
5900000	5902000	A lick in on me
5912000	5914000	How do I suck so badly
5914000	5916000	I'm not being funny
5916000	5918000	I'm getting absolutely
5920000	5922000	I'm getting
5922000	5924000	Just
5924000	5926000	They're making a mockery out of me
5926000	5928000	They're making an absolute mockery out of me
5930000	5932000	Does this guy even have a name
5936000	5938000	Okay phone a friend
5938000	5940000	Adrenaline
5940000	5942000	Oh he got a heal I'm gonna steal his heal
5942000	5944000	Right it's a 50-50
5944000	5946000	Let me start comboing the items
5946000	5948000	Oh I'm too dumb for that though
5952000	5954000	That actually feels like
5954000	5956000	Injection into
5958000	5960000	That puts adrenaline into your heart
5960000	5962000	Which basically forces it to go
5968000	5970000	Like I'm just shooting
5970000	5972000	So anyway I start blasting
5972000	5974000	Cause I'm unable to
5974000	5976000	Keep up with them
5976000	5978000	Oh wait I actually won out of
5978000	5980000	Just pure frustration
5980000	5982000	We won that round anyway
5982000	5984000	Starts blasting
5984000	5986000	We did it we made it to round two
5986000	5988000	Of double or nothing
5988000	5990000	I've still yet to make it
5990000	5992000	To round three
5994000	5996000	Okay let's see what we get
5996000	5998000	Cuff
5998000	6000000	Double damage
6000000	6002000	Not medicine
6004000	6006000	Medicine that's not really medicine
6006000	6008000	Too blind
6014000	6016000	Does he have a polarizer he does
6022000	6024000	Phone in a friend
6024000	6026000	Wow
6032000	6034000	Steel
6034000	6036000	Polarizer
6038000	6040000	Shoot him
6040000	6042000	Steel Polarizer shoot him
6044000	6046000	Yes
6048000	6050000	Steel Polarizer
6050000	6052000	Shoot him
6054000	6056000	And then shoot
6058000	6060000	Okay then he'll shoot
6060000	6062000	Blank on me
6062000	6064000	Cause we know it doesn't have
6064000	6066000	Anything in it
6068000	6070000	And then double sawing off
6072000	6074000	Oh he's healing
6078000	6080000	So let him shoot
6080000	6082000	It's just fine cause it's blank
6082000	6086000	Oh for god he can get an extra turn
6086000	6088000	Efficient himself
6092000	6094000	I keep forgetting the mechanics
6094000	6096000	Of this dumb game
6096000	6098000	Why is it he is allowed to heal
6098000	6100000	And he's allowed to do this
6100000	6102000	And he's allowed to do that
6102000	6104000	Don't you know the video game rules
6104000	6106000	Only I'm supposed to be able
6106000	6108000	To do all the things that help me
6108000	6110000	Win the game
6110000	6112000	Wow
6112000	6114000	I never thought that far ahead
6114000	6116000	I never thought in the first place
6116000	6118000	That should be my sentence
6118000	6120000	I don't think
6120000	6122000	Right what was that 50-50
6122000	6124000	Right at least we can heal first
6128000	6130000	Watch your enemies hand close
6130000	6132000	Bro
6134000	6136000	Hordeshell library
6136000	6138000	That gives me nothing thank you
6138000	6140000	Let me again
6140000	6142000	What's in the chamber
6142000	6144000	Blank
6144000	6146000	I don't have a polarizer
6146000	6148000	So I can officially shoot myself
6148000	6150000	Bunk
6150000	6152000	Right and then
6152000	6154000	And then what
6156000	6158000	I mean that means odds are
6158000	6160000	It's a double
6160000	6162000	Cuff him
6162000	6164000	Okay and then what
6164000	6166000	And then
6166000	6168000	What I can do is just guess
6168000	6170000	I'll say it from this one
6170000	6172000	So what's this the third
6176000	6178000	Wow
6178000	6180000	This is why I don't gamble
6180000	6182000	I have no interest in gambling
6182000	6184000	I have no interest in playing Genshin Impact
6184000	6186000	Because it's a gamba game or something like that
6186000	6188000	I actually don't know if Genshin Impact is a gamba game
6188000	6190000	But yeah
6192000	6194000	Remaining ammo inside
6194000	6196000	You're trying to help me and it doesn't help
6196000	6198000	Because I'm so dumb it doesn't help
6198000	6200000	I'm too dumb to be helped
6200000	6202000	You guys are just
6202000	6204000	Gonna have to send in your gameplay and I'll commentate over
6204000	6206000	And pretend that I'm playing
6206000	6208000	That seems like a plan
6208000	6210000	Surely
6216000	6218000	I'm not I'm losing it
6218000	6220000	Right
6220000	6222000	New round
6222000	6224000	Let's see what we're working with
6224000	6226000	Two lives three blank
6234000	6236000	A burner
6236000	6238000	Just show me if it's good or bad
6240000	6242000	It's good
6242000	6244000	I don't have a polarizer though
6246000	6248000	Clink
6248000	6250000	And there's four in the chamber left
6250000	6252000	So let's talk to the phone
6252000	6254000	Because they say, listen
6256000	6258000	Okay
6258000	6260000	That means the odds have increased
6260000	6262000	That this is a live round
6264000	6266000	So we're gonna say funk it
6266000	6268000	And
6268000	6270000	We start splasting
6274000	6276000	Yes
6276000	6278000	Okay we know next is blank
6278000	6280000	He doesn't
6280000	6282000	He doesn't have a polarizer either
6286000	6288000	Oh
6288000	6290000	Good or bad
6294000	6296000	We know this is blank
6296000	6298000	But we know that this is live
6298000	6300000	And now he knows it's live
6300000	6302000	And he's got a double
6302000	6304000	It's ogre
6304000	6306000	It's ogre
6306000	6308000	He's cuffing me bro
6308000	6310000	Wait what
6310000	6312000	Now it's live
6316000	6318000	Oh my goodness golly
6318000	6320000	This game if you are
6320000	6322000	Like me in small brain
6322000	6324000	This game ain't for you
6324000	6326000	I got one more in the tank
6326000	6328000	Because she be getting ready to go live
6328000	6330000	We got one more
6330000	6332000	Come on
6332000	6334000	That's it you know what
6334000	6336000	I'm writing down
6336000	6338000	This freaking piece of paper
6338000	6340000	What the heck is going on in this game
6340000	6342000	I'm gonna call in
6342000	6344000	This freaking
6344000	6346000	I'm gonna call in the big guns
6346000	6348000	Which is me writing on a piece of paper
6348000	6350000	To write down the odds
6350000	6352000	To write down what there is
6352000	6354000	To write down what to do
6354000	6356000	If we do not win this one
6356000	6358000	This settles it
6358000	6360000	That you guys are just far too smart for me
6360000	6362000	And you have picked the most
6362000	6364000	Are worded oh she
6364000	6366000	There possibly could be in all the lines
6368000	6370000	Right pull out items
6370000	6372000	Magnifying glass
6372000	6374000	Health
6374000	6376000	No don't want meds
6376000	6378000	I'm not taking my meds
6378000	6380000	You can't convince me
6380000	6382000	Right what's in the chamber
6382000	6384000	Two live
6384000	6386000	Three
6386000	6388000	Lang
6388000	6390000	And then I'm gonna do it like hangman
6390000	6392000	On my piece of paper
6392000	6394000	So the odds
6394000	6396000	Are already
6396000	6398000	Not the best
6400000	6402000	I am going to
6402000	6404000	Seal
6404000	6406000	His phone
6408000	6410000	I'm gonna steal his phone
6412000	6414000	No
6414000	6416000	Yes
6416000	6418000	Yes I'm going to
6418000	6420000	To steal his phone to get the intel
6422000	6424000	Fifth shell blank
6424000	6426000	Okay so for hangman there's now a B
6426000	6428000	On the fifth one
6428000	6430000	For blank
6430000	6432000	We are going to see what's inside
6432000	6434000	Cause either way we're doing damage to this round
6434000	6436000	It's a blank so we're going to
6436000	6438000	Apply the polarizing effect
6438000	6440000	We're gonna put B on the first hangman
6440000	6442000	Section as well
6442000	6444000	So we're polarizing
6444000	6446000	To make it hurt
6446000	6448000	The dealer is being shot
6448000	6450000	With the polarizing effect
6450000	6452000	Resulting damage to the dealer
6452000	6454000	Okay
6454000	6456000	Okay
6456000	6458000	So first one's blank, last one's blank
6458000	6460000	We now know this, that's perfectly fine
6460000	6462000	We're lint
6462000	6464000	All it took was writing it down on a piece of paper
6464000	6466000	And playing hangman
6466000	6468000	Neither am I, that's why we're playing hangman
6470000	6472000	He is now inspecting
6472000	6474000	He claims the contents
6474000	6476000	Are very interesting
6476000	6478000	He shoots me with a live
6478000	6480000	Round so the second position
6480000	6482000	Is live
6482000	6484000	We are now on a 50-50
6484000	6486000	On the contents of the gun
6486000	6488000	Being live or blank, we cannot ascertain
6488000	6490000	We can heal up
6490000	6492000	But we cannot ascertain
6492000	6494000	What is inside
6494000	6496000	This truly is a 50-50
6496000	6498000	He drank a beer
6498000	6500000	What did I miss it?
6500000	6502000	Two and three were live
6502000	6504000	The blank, wait
6504000	6506000	But none of us have a polarizer
6508000	6510000	So this round can't be complete
6510000	6512000	So we need to start a new
6512000	6514000	Freaking round in hangman game
6514000	6516000	Goodness gravy
6516000	6518000	All blanks
6518000	6520000	Okay, okay, okay
6520000	6522000	A BBL
6522000	6524000	No I didn't get a BBL but thanks for asking baby
6524000	6526000	Right
6526000	6528000	Let's play hangman over again
6528000	6530000	Let me, what is the ratio
6530000	6532000	Three live, four blank
6532000	6534000	Three live, four
6534000	6536000	Blank
6536000	6538000	For a total of seven on hangman
6538000	6540000	One, two, three, four, five
6540000	6542000	Seven
6542000	6544000	I have adrenaline to call in
6544000	6546000	For information
6546000	6548000	Which we're going to do
6554000	6556000	Right, you can yoink the yoink
6556000	6558000	Right, position
6558000	6560000	Second shell, blank
6560000	6562000	Hangman, second is B, blank
6562000	6564000	Oh sugar, I just dropped my pencil
6568000	6570000	If we handcuff
6570000	6572000	And we are going to act like
6572000	6574000	The first one is live
6574000	6576000	Okay
6576000	6578000	We are going to treat it as live
6578000	6580000	We do not know and we cannot ascertain
6580000	6582000	If that information is true or not
6582000	6584000	However, we can shoot ourselves for
6584000	6586000	Okay, that was a blank
6586000	6588000	So first two are filled out B's
6588000	6590000	That leaves
6590000	6592000	Two blank and three live on the board
6592000	6594000	We are going to shoot ourselves
6594000	6596000	To give ourselves another round
6596000	6598000	Sadly
6600000	6602000	There are now five
6602000	6604000	Pieces remaining
6604000	6606000	And we cannot ascertain
6606000	6608000	The knowledge, so we're going to treat it
6608000	6610000	As alive, this truly is a 50-50
6610000	6612000	We're going to treat it as alive
6612000	6614000	Because odds are it's alive
6614000	6616000	You know what, I'm just going to go fuck myself then
6616000	6618000	You know what, because that's the thing with odds
6618000	6620000	That is the thing with odds
6620000	6622000	That is the thing
6622000	6624000	With odds
6624000	6626000	Yeah
6626000	6628000	It could literally, you can flip a coin
6628000	6630000	10 times in a row and statistically
6630000	6632000	Never get hits 10 times in a row
6632000	6634000	But that's the thing with odds
6634000	6636000	They are not reality
6636000	6638000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
6638000	6640000	Yeah, yeah, yeah
6640000	6642000	That's, right, another
6642000	6644000	Sorry, I'm addicted
6644000	6646000	I'm addicted, I like this approach
6646000	6648000	Sorry, the hangman approach is quite fun
6648000	6650000	I'm addicted, I can't stop
6650000	6652000	She beats up in 10 minutes
6652000	6654000	We've got 10 minutes to speak on this
6654000	6656000	Come on
6656000	6658000	10 minutes
6660000	6662000	Oh my god, come on, come on
6662000	6664000	Please save the waiver
6664000	6666000	I will, anything for you dealer
6666000	6668000	Again, again, again, again
6672000	6674000	Okay
6686000	6688000	Who goes there?
6688000	6690000	Identify yourself
6690000	6692000	3 life, 4 blank
6692000	6694000	3 life, 4 blank
6694000	6696000	7 hangman
6698000	6700000	Okay
6700000	6702000	We have adrenaline
6706000	6708000	We are going to get intel
6708000	6710000	from this adrenaline
6710000	6712000	I assume you can only use adrenaline once per round
6712000	6714000	Right, the intel is
6716000	6718000	The intel is third shell life route
6718000	6720000	Okay
6720000	6722000	Can we do double adrenaline?
6724000	6726000	Hello
6728000	6730000	Double adrenaline
6730000	6732000	That's cheating
6736000	6738000	Blank, shit, we need, oh we have a polarizer
6738000	6740000	Okay, that's perfect
6740000	6742000	If we handcuff
6742000	6744000	Or does that leave
6744000	6746000	That's 2 life on the board
6746000	6748000	We don't know about 3 life on the board
6748000	6750000	We don't know about
6750000	6752000	Tell you what we could do
6752000	6754000	Handcuff
6758000	6760000	Polarize
6762000	6764000	Shoot
6770000	6772000	Discard
6772000	6774000	The current unknown
6774000	6776000	Because we don't know what it is
6776000	6778000	We don't know what it is
6778000	6780000	And I don't trust it
6780000	6782000	So we're just going to discard it
6782000	6784000	Okay, we're just going to discard it
6784000	6786000	It doesn't really matter
6786000	6788000	Okay, so we can write down blank in second
6788000	6790000	So now there's 2 blank and 2 life
6790000	6792000	The odds are straight back to 50-50 again
6792000	6794000	We are going to shoot
6796000	6798000	Okay, okay
6798000	6800000	So now there's 1 blank remaining
6800000	6802000	And 2 live on the board
6802000	6804000	Hmm
6806000	6808000	I'm going to eject a blank
6808000	6810000	So all remaining are now live
6810000	6812000	Shit
6812000	6814000	And he's going to do 3 health damage
6814000	6816000	In the sequence
6816000	6818000	Wait
6818000	6820000	Yeah, no, yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry
6820000	6822000	Then blank was the 5th there
6822000	6824000	And then it's 2 live remaining now
6824000	6826000	Sorry, my apologies
6826000	6828000	2 live remaining
6828000	6830000	Okay
6830000	6832000	Unfortunately, he will get a lick in on us
6832000	6834000	But that's fine, that's fine
6834000	6836000	Do you feel so big brain now?
6836000	6838000	No, I'm cheating by playing Hangman
6838000	6840000	And writing it down, that's how hard this game is
6840000	6842000	For me to conceptualize it in my head
6842000	6844000	I cannot do this
6844000	6846000	In an abstract
6846000	6848000	Concept
6848000	6850000	I don't have the ability to do this
6850000	6852000	I have to write everything down, it has to be physical
6852000	6854000	In front of me
6854000	6856000	We've got 2 insights
6856000	6858000	Fantastic
6858000	6860000	Oh
6864000	6866000	I'm not going to do it for this round
6866000	6868000	Umm
6868000	6870000	He's got a polarizer?
6870000	6872000	No he doesn't
6872000	6874000	I might as well shoot then
6874000	6876000	Shouldn't I?
6876000	6878000	There's no point in using this stuff
6878000	6880000	It's a 50-50, I might as well just shoot
6880000	6882000	There's no point
6882000	6884000	I've got 2 phones
6884000	6886000	1 for the velar, no use the phone
6886000	6888000	No get info
6888000	6890000	Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on
6890000	6892000	What's the point in me using the phone
6892000	6894000	Right now, because it's 50-50
6894000	6896000	If it's a blank
6896000	6898000	Oh wait, yeah
6898000	6900000	Idiot, if it's a blank then he can't get a licking on me
6900000	6902000	Sorry
6902000	6904000	Sorry
6904000	6906000	Sorry, I'm a bit slow
6906000	6908000	I'm a bit slow
6908000	6910000	I'm so sorry
6910000	6912000	I'm so slow
6912000	6914000	It takes me a moment to remember
6914000	6916000	The way this game plays
6916000	6918000	I'm so sorry
6918000	6920000	Okay
6922000	6924000	We are on to the second round
6928000	6930000	Yay
6932000	6934000	Okay, okay, okay, okay
6934000	6936000	Big brain time
6936000	6938000	Can you feel the wrinkles
6938000	6940000	becoming more wrinkly in your brain?
6940000	6942000	Your smooth piece of
6942000	6944000	chicken breast brain is now
6944000	6946000	magnifying
6946000	6948000	3 live, 3 blank
6948000	6950000	3 live, 3 blank
6954000	6956000	Okay
6956000	6958000	Insider knowledge, yes please
6960000	6962000	Third shell, blank
6962000	6964000	Okay
6964000	6966000	Adrenaline
6966000	6968000	Yonkers
6968000	6970000	I would like insider knowledge from the adrenaline
6970000	6972000	burst
6972000	6974000	Okay
6974000	6976000	What are you going to tell me?
6976000	6978000	Fourth shell, blank
6978000	6980000	Okay
6980000	6982000	Now
6982000	6984000	That leaves one blank
6984000	6986000	Unknown
6988000	6990000	The odds
6990000	6992000	is now one in four of the current
6992000	6994000	shell in the chamber being a blank
6994000	6996000	I think I want to shoot
6996000	6998000	So anyway
6998000	7000000	I start blasting
7000000	7002000	The odds of one in four
7002000	7004000	Yep, okay
7004000	7006000	That's what I like to see
7006000	7008000	Live one in four
7008000	7010000	We are going
7010000	7012000	Okay, he's going to heal up
7012000	7014000	That's perfectly fine
7014000	7016000	He is going to be able to see what's inside
7016000	7018000	And he does have a polarizer
7018000	7020000	So I'm going to have to be cautious of that
7020000	7022000	He's going to check it out
7022000	7024000	What do you see?
7024000	7026000	Very interesting
7026000	7028000	Okay
7028000	7030000	Oh he's shooting, it's alive
7030000	7032000	Okay
7032000	7034000	So the next two we know are blank
7034000	7036000	So we can
7036000	7038000	Blank it up to high heavens, okay
7038000	7040000	Blank
7040000	7042000	Bonk
7042000	7044000	And then blank again
7044000	7046000	Thanks to our insider knowledge
7046000	7048000	I can't believe it, hangman works
7048000	7050000	And blank again
7050000	7052000	Then we are going to drink the beer
7052000	7054000	To inject the second last bullet
7054000	7056000	Because we will be able to
7056000	7058000	If this is blank
7058000	7060000	Or if it's live
7060000	7062000	So that was live
7062000	7064000	So that means the remaining one
7064000	7066000	Is blank
7066000	7068000	So we can just shoot ourselves
7070000	7072000	Bonk, okay
7072000	7074000	All good, all good in the hood
7074000	7076000	New round
7076000	7078000	We do
7078000	7080000	Insider
7080000	7082000	The game knows we are playing hangman
7082000	7084000	The game knows
7084000	7086000	What we got, 4 live
7086000	7088000	4 blank
7088000	7090000	4 live
7090000	7092000	4 blank
7092000	7094000	Hangman, 1, 2, 3
7094000	7096000	Okay I don't have enough room on the paper
7096000	7098000	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
7098000	7100000	Sorry I need to re-write that
7100000	7102000	That really awkward bit
7102000	7104000	Right
7104000	7106000	Give me the
7106000	7108000	What's the update
7108000	7110000	Let us know what's going on here
7110000	7112000	3rd shell
7112000	7114000	Live, perfect
7114000	7116000	Let me know what else is going down
7126000	7128000	Obliet
7128000	7130000	I didn't realise he could do that
7134000	7136000	I didn't know he could do that
7136000	7138000	Like thanks
7138000	7140000	Right I'm going to
7140000	7142000	Judgement, I'm still going to take this
7142000	7144000	Because it's so much better and more valuable
7144000	7146000	To know what's coming up
7146000	7148000	5th shell, live, okay
7148000	7150000	Okay, okay, okay
7150000	7152000	We only don't know where 2 are
7152000	7154000	That leads me to believe
7154000	7156000	So the odds are now
7156000	7158000	What
7158000	7160000	1 in 3
7160000	7162000	That this is blank
7162000	7164000	No, that's not
7164000	7166000	That's not correct
7166000	7168000	I want to shoot myself
7174000	7176000	Against my better judgement
7176000	7178000	I'm going to claim this as a blank
7178000	7180000	Because statistically it should be
7184000	7186000	We did it
7186000	7188000	Okay we have a second round now
7188000	7190000	There are
7190000	7192000	3
7192000	7194000	Blank
7194000	7196000	What does this mean
7196000	7198000	Cigarettes
7198000	7200000	I can't heal up I don't think
7200000	7202000	In Minecraft
7202000	7204000	In Minecraft
7204000	7206000	Unknown
7206000	7208000	2nd live
7208000	7210000	I don't know
7210000	7212000	Shit or not, your max is HP
7212000	7214000	4, oh is it sorry
7214000	7216000	Let's have a wee quick siggy break
7216000	7218000	We'll start all over this
7218000	7220000	Thank you, sorry, my apologies
7220000	7222000	I thought this was like you couldn't heal it
7222000	7224000	A 4, 4, 4
7224000	7226000	Should we get a cigarette, smoker and gen 2
7226000	7228000	Apparently that's a really big
7228000	7230000	Kink
7230000	7232000	That I didn't know about
7232000	7234000	You know a wham and smokes a siggy
7236000	7238000	No, I don't know what it's going to be
7240000	7242000	You know what
7242000	7244000	If I shoot myself
7244000	7246000	It's actually going to not be that bad
7248000	7250000	Okay, we know this one is live
7250000	7252000	So we can shoot
7252000	7254000	Oh no a double shot
7254000	7256000	Shit
7256000	7258000	I get so excited to like
7258000	7260000	Utilize
7260000	7262000	We would have gone on to the next round
7264000	7266000	We would have gone on to the next round
7266000	7268000	If I wasn't so freaking quick
7268000	7270000	Shorty
7270000	7272000	Okay, he just ejected a live
7272000	7274000	So it's live, live, live actually
7274000	7276000	Wait what
7276000	7278000	Oh
7278000	7280000	Thanks for letting me go to the other round
7280000	7282000	Even though I messed up
7282000	7284000	I appreciate you dealer
7284000	7286000	The game must know I'm like sweating so hard
7286000	7288000	We finally made it
7288000	7290000	To round 3
7292000	7294000	Okay
7294000	7296000	Hangman ain't got nothing on us
7296000	7298000	Okay
7298000	7300000	Medicine
7300000	7302000	Polarize
7302000	7304000	That's very
7304000	7306000	That's fine
7306000	7308000	2 blank
7308000	7310000	3 blank sorry
7310000	7312000	Sorry number
7316000	7318000	We have no insider
7318000	7320000	Information at all
7320000	7322000	We have odds which is blank
7322000	7324000	The odds stipulate
7324000	7326000	This is a blank so I shouldn't theory
7326000	7328000	Put the polarizing on
7328000	7330000	And shoot myself
7330000	7332000	We have to go with odds
7332000	7334000	We have no choice
7334000	7336000	The dealer with polarizer on
7338000	7340000	So that was a blank
7340000	7342000	So now it's 2-2
7342000	7344000	50-50 perfect and he can see what's inside
7348000	7350000	Very interesting
7352000	7354000	Live
7354000	7356000	Okay
7356000	7358000	The odds are now 1 live, 2 blank
7358000	7360000	Wow
7364000	7366000	If I take the medicine I expire
7366000	7368000	Because my odds are not good enough
7372000	7374000	This is it
7374000	7376000	I either win this game mode
7376000	7378000	Or I lose it on whatever we pick
7378000	7380000	Refling's
7380000	7382000	Now the odds are this is blank
7386000	7388000	Swallow the medicine
7388000	7390000	I'll swallow it because you asked
7390000	7392000	Me to refling

7404000	7406000	With celebration
7408000	7410000	It was worth it though
7410000	7412000	I died doing what I love the most
7412000	7414000	Guzzling refling's ink
7416000	7418000	I perished doing what I love the most
7418000	7420000	Okay
7420000	7422000	So I don't feel that bad
7422000	7424000	So good that was fantastic

7426000	7428000	Revisiting this game in a membership stream

7430000	7432000	I may have already done before
7432000	7434000	But thank you so so much

7452000	7454000	Visual design

7458000	7460000	The poly
