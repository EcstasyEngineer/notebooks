1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hold on.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I have a lot of chance.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My life.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I hope I'm on the right thing.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm done.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't know if I missed it.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Who's driving this boo?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Because my voice is so messed up.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Valor.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Am I streaming?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't see it.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There'll be a live for 40 seconds.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I can't even see myself.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, there we go.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, I can hear myself.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I totally lost my voice.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Testing.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, freaking scary.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Broke my damn voice on that bloody stream.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Did you like it?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
From here on out, it's nothing but scuffing memes.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you're looking for professionals,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
go elsewhere, buddy.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go to Shibi's stream.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There's no happening here.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I promise you, mate.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My voice is so strange right now.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, my goodness.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Just the way we're like,

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
oh, it's been a bloody while since we've been together.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Fuck me, man.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That took me a year to spawn this.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I did it, though.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Holy shit, we did it.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Feet sniffer.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I didn't mean to imply greed.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, you didn't.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I know you didn't.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Please don't worry.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Please don't worry.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's fine.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The only reason I say greed is because of the perspective thing.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, fucking mischief, reflins.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My fucking god.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What a year it's been.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Holy crap.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I know I'm supposed to talk about my debut,

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but let's be honest, we're all reflins here.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, fucking mischiefs.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Of course, your names were going to be refling.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, my God.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What do you mean you became a squid VTuber just so your name

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
may only reflect you in another life?

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, come on.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Refling.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Come on.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Get it?

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Great barrier.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Reef.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Reef.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, I'm so excited to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood with you.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When this stream ends, I'm going to unlist all my streams.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Any reefers on the track?

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are reefers cannabis?

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't say that.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Does reeflings mean something different?

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In another life, I had a fan base called Reeflings,

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
but it was spelled slightly different.

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And I made it pronounced the same, but spelled differently.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah.

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't worry.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't worry.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you're not really familiar with me from the past,

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
don't worry about it.

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't worry about it.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm just strong at cuttles.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's keep it that way.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thank you very much.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Am I actually going through my 2.0,

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
or are we just meaming about it?

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are we just squidding around?

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are we just squidding around?

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
My bottle.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I have my reefing mail.

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Skullfish.

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, Skullfish is so good.

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, that's actually really small.

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll actually go through my slides,

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but I'm not really sure if there's much of a point,

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
because, well,

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
that's 2365 from Vsuck.

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Bomet.

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Product or Bomet.

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Right.

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let me drink my cola.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let me drink my cola.

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I was supposed to say 53.

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Also, someone doubted that Scots is a recognized language.

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It is.

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So, you know how it sounds like I'm speaking English here all the time?

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to give you a sentence.

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay.

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to type it in chat so you can read it.

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hmm.

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Hmm.

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hmm.

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hmm.

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hmm.

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hmm.

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, that is the sentence in Scots that I've just typed.

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And it says,

120
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you coming to my bit tonight?

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That means, are you coming to my house tonight?

122
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's Scots.

123
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
See how it's a bit different?

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not in the best sense,

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
but it's what I can think of with the top on the head,

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
but yeah.

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you coming to my bit tonight

128
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
means, are you coming to my house?

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I purposely don't really speak with a lot of slang

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
or mumbled the way I naturally do,

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,800
because I'm quite naturally monotone and mumbly

132
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,680
because the problem is

133
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,400
you guys don't understand me because I'm scottish

134
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:54,680
but if you are british or you're familiar with the scottish accent

135
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,960
then I probably actually don't sound from scottish indeed but

136
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,280
it is what it is and also I've been very like

137
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,920
when you're on the internet you're very americanized because of what you consume

138
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,320
does it take all your efforts to pronounce every syllable and not speak scott's

139
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:18,360
no I'm my mother dearest she actually taught me

140
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,640
she discouraged me from speaking in slang

141
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,000
so I doesn't always naturally come out but

142
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,680
um here's hoping it's the beginning of something

143
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,400
fucking cheers to that mate cheers to that

144
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,680
but yeah uh technically legally on paper

145
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,160
because I was born in scotland I could speak two languages thank you

146
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,240
neneath any help from jewel lingo let's go

147
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,360
uh but yeah so I'm a siren that can't sing

148
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,120
gee willikers I wonder why I just don't have a voice I'm also tone deaf by the

149
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,240
way so I hope you're ready for drunk karaoke streams

150
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:08,360
uh that stuff's gonna be uh intense let's see where these slides are

151
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,960
so both of your parents are scott's

152
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,600
um yeah the the band aids hold up

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,240
still top tier yep very top tier uh mongolian throats singing

154
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,960
the reason I don't like mongolian throats singing it's because cats don't

155
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,400
like mongolian throats singing because of the vibration it's an

156
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,840
unpleasant sound I have learned many traits of cats so I don't like it

157
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,640
drunk karaoke uh shebe's doing drunk ASMR this week uh if that's your

158
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,360
is that your heng to say is that your thing in scott's you go

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,960
is that your heng is that I is that your heng oh it is heng

161
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,400
oh my lore's being retconned by the way thanks to you guys

162
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,120
uh apparently my weaknesses are mirrors which are really like

163
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,640
uh I'm I'm definitely gonna do something with that because I think it's

164
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,880
such a cool thing I should have done it like a

165
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,320
character reference like strengths weaknesses because that would be so much

166
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,560
cooler to do but hey hold I actually have started reading this year um I

167
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,680
had a really rough year last year gee wonders oh wow

168
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:35,080
um and I started uh I picked up reading I have never read in my life um

169
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,080
and turns out I really like the stopian novels like George Orwell was so good

170
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,240
like Animal Farm in 1984 I absolutely love 1984

171
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,160
Fahrenheit was good like they quit I've read the classics I'm not read that much

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,720
um the women in the dunes as well is like the perfect

174
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,280
like book because it like encapsulates like human nature

175
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,760
and oh I just love like depressing books I love being depressed at the end and

176
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,520

182
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,760
complains because every time you mention you play games

183
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,600
uh what do you mean you're not top 500 in this game

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,160

shit at them too like my god can you hear yourself

186
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,160
you're actually like so fucking negative anyway I'll help you get more

187
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,600
positive actually the reason why you're negative

188
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,040
is because your kd is negative because you're scrubbing the game

189
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,960
that's why you just project anyway that's just me

190
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,520

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,920
that xbox game passes a thing I need to create an account I don't know what to

256
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,560

257
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,440
meanie or funny

258
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:02,280
but yeah anyway I'm an xbox kid and if you were able to catch the group stream

259
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,240
it's actually true that I had to present games to my dad to buy for me

260
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,520
or he would just buy it for me because he was like oh that's good for responso

261
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,600
um inherit your dad's account

262
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:23,800
um but I so these are like the majority of the games I

263
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,720
remember I'm gonna do like tons of xbox games I'm an xbox kid I never had a

264
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,440
PlayStation at all um so I didn't have access

265
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,080
I had a PlayStation my dad got a PlayStation 1

266
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,160
I didn't know how to read like no

267
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,200
yeah so I I'm just trying to think like the timeline

268
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,600
a lot of these games I played I didn't even have the ability to read yet

269
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,440
like I used to watch my dad play the games because I was so small

270
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,080
um but yeah basically

271
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,120
sonic generation

272
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,240
is sonic generation someone that was made after sonic heroes

273
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,240
uh I've not played bio shock 2 no I played bio shock 1

274
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,760
where you had bees bees um

275
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:32,920
my sweet little bumblebee I know what you want from me

276
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,240
um hypnosis themed feature where I really like hypnosis I've never done it

277
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,600
before but I'm going to participate it and try and get it for you

278
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,240
uh I never played sonic generation then no I played sonic heroes and then there

279
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,320
was a bit of a skip I played sonic unleash where he's like that werewolf

280
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,360
but I got stuck on the game because I was like too young

281
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,400
not very smart I'm not a very smart gamer okay

282
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,160
which is why I am perfectly happy with

283
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,840
hand-holding through games uh some streamers really don't like backseat

284
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,440
gaming for me absolutely do not mind it I'm

285
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,160
daft okay I'm completely daft I have no clue what's going on

286
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,400
okay

287
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,200

288
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,840
um but yes we're definitely going to replay a lot of xbox games as my

I too um the best halo game in your opinion

298
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,600
I'm biased I'm going to say combat evolved because my dad used to play it

299
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,280
like over and over and I used to hide behind the couch

300
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,280
I was so scared from the grumpy oneies they were like so

301
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,040
scary you actually finished meat boy that looked like I

302
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,400

310
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,800

313
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,760
uh I've also got um those old games uh from the xbox original days

344
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,600
that's like literally so talented um talented as in terms of all her hard

345
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,160
work and effort and blood sweat and tears that she's put into

346
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,680
honing her craft and art so I read this thing ages ago about art as being like

347
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,720
um we don't really like it when you say it's like overnight talent because it's

348
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,880
not it's like you you honed your craft and like you should be proud of honing

349
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,600
your craft you didn't just spawn in as an artist you know

350
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,240
gifted that's it you're not gifted you honed your craft you spent years on it

351
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,040
you got your xp bar raised up anyway that's just my small rant about being

352
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,640
nice to artists they aren't gifted they have spent years specializing

353
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,080

385
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,520
Creed brotherhood um it's going to be one of my

386
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,400
donor-thon rewards I've already recorded the footage

387
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,760
to do it I just need to write the script and everything

388
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,080
but like I kid you not I'm doing like a video essay 40 minutes long I don't care

389
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm like gonna fill Tezmo unless okay we've been on games for quite a while now

390
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm like um you guys are probably sick of staring at these games

391
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,720
um I did that no I think I've done this wrong

392
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,360
hey hello

393
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,360
uh I think I said all the game stream said yeah oh we're playing old-school

394
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,000
Rinscape 8 hour Assassin's Creed brotherhood lore

395
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,040
coming in what have I done probably like

396
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,680
less than an hour but um

397
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,320
yes probably uh old-school Rinscape uh is our weekend game it's going to be

398
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,480
mostly a multiplayer game for this month until

399
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:17,880
June 19th when the Eldon wait why the fuck is there two

400
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,800
oh I must have missed one um you've never played Rinscape don't worry

401
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,160
we're doing questing my only problem with old-school Rinscape is

402
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,760
I think you have to pay the premium experience for premium

403
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,120
or we're all just going to get shafted playing that game like

404
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,880
not in a good way um but yes Eldon Ring

405
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,040
Eldon Ring DLC comes out on the 19th and then the multiplayer game for like

406
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,920
four days in a row I'm doing multiplayer games

407
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,760
you need to teach me old-school Rinscape literally I just go like fishing

408
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,360
the back of Lumbridge let me castle not the back

409
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,720
next to the main but south of the castle um

410
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,160
but I uh what was that single word of fun oh uh probably four days of multiplayer

411
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,320
Eldon Ring and then I have a very unique stream come in

412
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,920
with the first collab outside of Vealor at the end of the month

413
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:20,520
with a feature called Sin Sister and we may or may not have both purchased

414
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,680
shock collars which we will give each other control of the shock collars

415
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,840
and we are going to play multiplayer Eldon Ring and whoever causes us

416
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,560
to die whichever one causes us to die gets to shock them

417
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,680
basically yep we are we're doing that um I believe

418
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,760
Sheebie is also getting a shock collar so I might have some sort of stream with

419
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,520
her relating to that uh I use a shock collar for

420
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,720
DEMPA

421
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,120

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,760
myself to like go talk to people like like I was scared of DEMPA

424

reeflings have a patch on their head is a nicotine patch to help you with your

487
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,360
addiction because we have an addiction to one each one of you to each other

488
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,920
yeah so that's why you have a nicotine patch and you have lovely tentacles

489
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,960
I've already got lots of suspicious artwork of us together but it's for

504
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:43,640
loading screen was so expensive actually Yuri you may cooked with the loading

505
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,440
screen she's actually making another alternative version because I had to do

506
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,800
that cover-up thing but that was very expensive as well

507
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,880
I just like when I get into it and then obviously why I picked my gen

508
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,600
mate yeah that was so fun to do um like everyone's like oh this is my first

509
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:10,120
impressions no mother fucker I picked them

510
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:19,160
are so fun it was so fun being able to say that and being like yeah yeah absolutely

511
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,120
evil strongy be like I always use stingers I love stingers I love when v-tubers

512
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,200
have 10 minutes of stream starting soon at the start of their streams perish

513
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,240
absolutely perish nonsense I'm starting up on a brotherhood at the menu

514
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:44,120
tomorrow mark my words um but yes

515
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,440
uh I was just fantastic the girls

516
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,200
it's hard to judge people when they apply because

517
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:59,160
it just felt really um we're weird

518
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,440
hold on

519
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:10,840
hold on um yeah it felt weird trying to put put them on because some of them said

520
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,520
put me on any model some of them said I wanted a specific model I think Azura

521
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,080
got who she wanted

522
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,600
she'd be

523
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:32,680
um Mercy wanted AC AC wanted AC so AC got AC

524
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Amy did you see anyone

525
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,360
anyway it's impossible to give people the outline that they wanted because they

526
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,200
couldn't even see it like it is they couldn't even see it it was just an

527
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,560
outline um did you have any awkward or weird

528
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,080
applications uh someone's intro video was

529
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,480
30 seconds uh for anyone watching if you're

530
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,080
serious about joining a vtuber agency uh what you're supposed to roughly do

531
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,720
in uh application introduction video is to say

532
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,640
your accolades whatever you achieved as a streamer prior to

533
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,600
what you're doing now so you mention how often you stream do you stream three

534
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,040
times a week consistently good thing to mention

535
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:30,360
um 30 seconds uh just it was like hi i'm

536
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,280
and i stream on and that was it and i was like bro what am i supposed to do with

537
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,880
that um but yeah you're supposed to say

538
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,960
your accolades what you want to achieve within the agency is a good thing

539
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,080
to mention um you're also supposed to pass the

540
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,480
test where you say hi vealer at the start because that means you read the

541
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,200
instructions properly if you didn't start with hi vealer

542
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,240
um i didn't close your application right away i gave you a chance but it's kind

543
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,400
of one of those tests where those who did it i know you read

544
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,960
those who didn't either you forgot although i say that i mean the girls

545
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,120
have given me permission to kind of talk about that the thing

546
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,960
azura's application was unprofessional

547
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,800
fuck i'm not even going to be around the bush with azura

548
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,640
she gave me permission to talk about it in her intro like her introduction

549
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,920
she's like hey i'm azura and she was like i really don't like pickles

550
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,160
and i don't like mustard and i was i'm like azura this is your

551
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,080
introduction video you're supposed to like tell me things you've achieved

552
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,280
she's like yeah i don't like the taste of these certain foods

553
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,200
and i was like you're perfect for the hag and you come

554
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,040
like you're perfect for the doting hag that we've got like no competition

555
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,800
um uh i say doesn't even english isn't even her first language

556
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,440
she had the most professional uh application she had these

557
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:20,040
massive paragraphs serious answers uh immi was a dafty she

558
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,880
freaking forgot to edit one part of her application

559
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,400
and in one of the answers she was like i want to diddle the other girls and i'm

560
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,240
like i knew it was an oversight because everything else was professional i'm

561
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,280
like any one earth have you put um

562
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,280
she be she failed the high vealour

563
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,280
mercy um must have watched her introduction video like

564
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,640
30 times over she was so like she went above and beyond

565
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,080
she actually created icy um like recreated her outline and named her and all

566
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:06,680
that pocha emmi left that on purpose

567
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,200
yeah um the introduction video gives me a very

568
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,920
good hint to what kind of each of her you are

569
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,160
no what kind of person you are because there's one thing to stream

570
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,840
but when you're talking directly to someone who's assessing you

571
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:30,120
you act a bit different um and yes it was very interesting

572
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,480
i got serenaded so much so i don't know why i'm

573
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,560
frol blinking and let me just give me one second

574
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,600
we're totally not recalibrating the old mech hold on

575
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,480
that's better calibration um

576
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,240
yeah i got serenaded so many people were singing i'm like you don't have to sing

577
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,480
to be in this agency you just need a one cover song that's it

578
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,200
i'm not gonna force you to sing um

579
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,560
probably

580
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:14,360
one of the most frustrating things was we asked to have streaming history

581
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,840
and people's evidence of like being a streamer was like a link to their twitter

582
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,720
and no other thing oh no content creator that was the

583
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,040
terminology used you had to be a content creator and it was like

584
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,800
are you okay why are you linking your twitter twitter isn't content

585
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,560
there weren't even a v-tweet or anything like that and it was just like

586
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,400
rub are the girls doing more songs yes

587
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,200
100% uh if the girls want to pursue more singing they just

588
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,760
come and me tell me what they want to do uh and i get that she don't

589
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,960
uh well other things obviously i'm not gonna say anything private um

590
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,880
i'm very flattered there were some very big names that applied

591
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,880
but they just weren't a good fit or they already had a pre-established brand and

592
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,000
it was like is this really what you want

593
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,560
i think you just wanted i think some people that were very

594
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,760
notoriet had high notoriety were interested more in the manager side

595
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,480
of things than actually being that velar we had like one person was

596
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,800
freaking massive and they were like can i keep my ip and join you and i'm like

597
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,960
sorry i need to own the rights to the models in order to do what we need to

598
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,200
okay it was a shame because i'm sure that person would have done just fine but

599
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:49,000
yeah it was it's not possible to not have the ip and utilize the gills

600
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:55,880
yes it was in the facts on the page um yeah the website got so many

601
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,080
fucking questions that were answered on the website

602
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,120
so they had to ignore the tab that had all the information

603
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,600
to go to the contact part of the website

604
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:15,080
to then ask the question that was already on the website

605
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:21,080
um literally i tried so hard to make that shit be as

606
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,440
comprehensible as possible

607
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,240
um

608
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:33,160
yes i think the applicants definitely read through it all

609
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,400
uh

610
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,240
brief time oh i can't see that sorry sorry i'm not uh that's the quote it's a

611
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,240
code name code name i did not say that word please don't get on me

612
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,520
um

613
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:52,120
um i'm just trying to think back if there's anything notable on the

614
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:58,120
applications oh my god there was one application

615
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:06,680
she was outrageous outrageous if you apply to an agency that agency

616
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,080
watches your content this girl my goodness

617
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,600
she applied i went on her twitter her twitch to listen to her live to check

618
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:22,520
her out and all that she admitted in the next

619
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,840
live stream oh i'd only do via lure for one year and then

620
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,240
bring the my audience over to this account

621
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:37,240
why would you admit that i'm very happy to say i never even considered her

622
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:43,480
but oh my god how could you be so like i don't even know what the word is

623
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,800
i was gobsmacked like i sent it to other members of the team

624
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,560
to make sure i heard what i heard was correct

625
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,760
but they outright said yeah i would just do it for one year and then bring my

626
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,720
audience over

627
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,800

establish yourself on youtube at first and we have monetization on youtube and

668
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,320
the girls income is all sorted but yes there are plans i will make it free

669
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,960
access um

670
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,440
i do not believe in charging any further than

671
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,880
um youtube membership and patreon so all together is

672
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,800
999 for your oh shi desu to support because it

673
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,200
is it is 199 for emotes to make sure no one gets gifted membership

674
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,440
and then is it 499 or is it 399

675
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,720
my voice is

676
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:56,040
is it 4999 for membership usually

677
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,640
is 499 yeah 4999 seen agreeable okay 199 for tier 1 499 yeah that sounds

678
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,560
right that sounds right um as long as you guys don't think it's outrageous

679
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,480
like in the state each um as i've said in the vealer

680
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,480
smoothstream we are undercutting the market

681
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,920
um i'm not even going to pretend otherwise uh on the vea side of things

682
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,840
most vea's start at $10 for two exclusive audios

683
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:26,600
we are undercutting the market by doing four audios for $5

684
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,680
and no price increase at all is planned and if you

685
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,640
fell ever so inclined you can donate more via

686
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,280
donate you can support more via patreon there is a secondary

687
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:46,040
tier that uh it's $20 i believe um i haven't put anything else

688
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:53,160
um yes what's your history with hypnosis i'm learning i'm a new baby

689
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,400
um but i'm going to give it my best shot i have a very

690
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,720
uh deep interest in it i've just never actually made content about it like

691
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:07,160
straight up uh it's not expensive yes i

692
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,440
oh i really i've heard some stories around that it was going to be

693
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,800
five for standard and 20 oh no no we're undercutting the market five

694
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,760
dollars and you get four four audios per month

695
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,400
um are you concerned undercutting could cause a scene

696
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,480
wide price shift downwards uh no because prices are going up

697
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:45,000
everywhere um following the voice actress trends

698
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,760
um on the ASMR side of things and the the roleplay side of things

699
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,080
prices are only going up uh and i believe in the opposite i believe in

700
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,400
delivering both quality and quantity um without

701
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,680
overworking the girls please understand that management uh have

702
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:06,120
dictated the scripts for a couple of months however

703
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,960
um there's few girls interested in writing their scripts i'm also very

704
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,480
open to writing scripts live unfortunately will be a membership

705
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,320
stream uh for me content wise to give you guys exactly

706
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,000
what you're looking for um but please understand i cannot pigeon

707
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,240
hold the girls into doing the same thing over and over again

708
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,960
just rehashed that's not that's not um

709
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,560
that is no way for them to be set up for success that is

710
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,680
they will be set up for failure sadly if i did that and i really hope

711
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,560
yeah have you written any scripts yet yeah you listen to them

712
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,920
everything you look that's out right now on patreon is done by me

713
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:53,160
the two other script writers kicking i want to say roughly in three months

714
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:59,400
and then the manager for the scripts is about to kick in

715
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,840
i don't know quite what's happening yet if they'll write the majority

716
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,000
um this is just my humble opinion but because

717
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,720
i don't have my scripts do not come out as best

718
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:21,480
as if a man had written it that's just my opinion

719
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,320
um the emi has shown interest in a script shibi has shown interest in

720
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,640
writing i think azura prefers the help

721
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:39,160
azura um i think she needs reassurance ac

722
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,200
ac is good at improv i think she may do some improv scripts in the

723
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,920
future uh yeah

724
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:57,080
what is the adult aspect to the agency uh the alternate alt twitters and uh

725
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:04,840
patreon yeah azura did you just did

726
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,600
i eventually want to be a member for the girls you girls they're they're fine

727
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:15,160
uh yeah i'll kind of repeat this if you like are in a position where you can

728
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,720
support like a like one girl please think about supporting

729
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:26,200
the other girls over me um i am living a very good life um

730
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,720
and things are going very well please don't worry about me okay

731
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,640
how do you find the alternate of twitters

732
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:42,920
check who they're following yeah check it check who they're following

733
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,040
question about your design how did you come up with the twin tails and the

734
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,080
candy pee is seashells i'm a cuttlefish i'm i'm a cbtuber

735
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:56,200
uh these are cuttlefish uh sorry these are seashells

736
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:02,360
uh and then i got double bunches um i love symmetrical hair and i love bunches

737
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,320
so i've got double bunches

738
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:13,800
um would you be open to accepting script submissions

739
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,560
absolutely i don't know how to set it up i don't know how to do it and i don't

740
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:23,240
know i need i would need to like give a guide because

741
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:31,720
it's quite hard to get it all efficient and good to go

742
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,440
definitely open to it please do let us cook though like literally the dust is

743
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,800
settling the girls are about to start doing game streams after these two

744
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,800
point ohs um the first week i did request the girls to

745
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,120
stream as much as they're physically able to without cancelling streams i have

746
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,200
emphasised to them that cancelling streams

747
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,880
try your best to not over promise it's better to

748
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:04,920
take a day off than it is to um plan a stream that you think you can do and

749
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,760
then you get too tired and cancel it because cancelling streams is very

750
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,440
people plan people plan their time and their days and their energy

751
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,720
around a stream if they know what time it's coming on and it's very valuable

752
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:23,640
to respect people's time so like for reeflands for example you guys know

753
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:29,880
that i don't stop streaming like at all and i'm always there and i literally

754
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,600
have never cancelled the stream so and that's true i haven't cancelled the

755
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,000
stream

756
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,400
um sorry to tell you just to bring the topic back gifted membership is the one

757
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,280
that's closest to five dollars yeah you may have to go higher

758
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:54,200
eh it's all i thought gifted membership went to the lowest tier tier one was

759
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:59,640
going to be emotes only and then tier two is going to be four ninety nine

760
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,720
i really don't want to overcharge so there is gonna

761
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,880
well wait more streams uh yeah i stream all day every eight

762
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:21,000
maybe just make it an extra dollar it's expensive though

763
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,920
who goes there by the pope identify yourself

764
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,840
um how do you prevent any mischief from the talents

765
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,200
uh i know they're responsible adults but from a legal span

766
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,360
standpoint how do you prevent any possible uh repercussions of the

767
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,640
talents actions does the company not take responsibility

768
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:50,040
or do they do create freedom um i literally said in the interview you're

769
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,480
not going to get in trouble i'm not your mum i couldn't give less of two shits

770
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,400
what you do um i basically said the only thing i

771
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:03,800
ask you not to do is release any nda content and um

772
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,560
you know don't say the n word you know basic adult

773
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:12,920
stuff it's pretty much it i mean i don't know what else to tell you

774
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,040
when you treat adults like adults they act like adults

775
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,520
it's crazy

776
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:27,640
did you hypnotize the girls to become the characters

777
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,200
eh i hope you're drinking a lot soda i'm i'm going cola it's fizzy juice

778
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,960
actually sorry you're turning scots it's not cold it's not uh

779
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:41,640
soda it's fizzy juice um yes

780
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,200
um as for repercussions like as i said we don't do

781
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,600
um suspensions however i did warn them i said

782
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:56,200
does it mean you're allowed free reign like we can cut we can terminate

783
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,880
obviously we don't want to do that and no girl has given any indication of any

784
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,640
of that shit thank god yeah i have full faith in these

785
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,880
girls i've known them for two months now like no issues not one issue has

786
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,760
popped up um

787
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,760
oh yeah fizzy juice is how you say it in scotland fizzy

788
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,960
are you a hire up in the agency nah i said don't call me boss

789
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,120
um i basically

790
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,160
got their script started but it's going to script manager

791
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:36,120
and i don't have to do any work i get to stream all day long

792
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,800
um

793
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,320
yeah so i'm kind of asked about gentle uh year away bro

794
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:50,840
year away do you plan on doing movie watch alongs absolutely

795
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,440
will you ever do a deep sea creature list oh my god yeah that's so good that's a

796
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,320
good idea i like that i was gonna uh so this is a failed

797
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,560
stream idea i was actually gonna um order a like a cuttlefish

798
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,320
it wouldn't be alive but i wanted to explore the biology of it because

799
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,520
i think they're pretty cool like cephalopods are pretty cool

800
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,440
and i wanted to like show you guys like if i was a cuttle

801
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,720
it's a little looks good but i think people would find it a bit more bit

802
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:24,120
than like essentially playing with a dead body so yeah probably can do that

803
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,840
i've not played subnautica i don't have a memory of playing it

804
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,080
um uh could give it a good shot

805
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:41,160
could recommend it but it's for science

806
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:49,000
cephalopog for memes for memes cephalopog sorry

01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,840

01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,440
which tags are missing i've got strong sena for general

811

i've got smuttlefish for all and cephalopog for me

812
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,920
so i need live clips in art

813
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,760
cracked which i didn't even have to come up with it myself what a genius

814
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,680
hey

815
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,840
as long as i respect them actually use it for educational content

816
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,760
yeah i like biology but i think people find it quite morbid sometimes

817
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,320
and i don't want to upset anyone

818
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:59,000
can't believe you're already taking advantage of it

819
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,360
you like it really i've mistaken advantage of yeah

820
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,160
what a refund

821
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:15,800
tentacles i don't have any tentacles

822
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:20,040
i may get tentacles another time but i don't have tentacles

823
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,720
i feel like if i had tentacles they would come out with my

824
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:29,240
i'm gonna be honest i don't think they would be tail tailbone attached

825
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,560
i think they would come out my other end

826
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,720
out of all the girls who do you think is gonna overwork themselves for sheebie

827
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,000
and sheebie's already done so much work in advance

828
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,360
um so she can focus on streams

829
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,400
the tentacles not be around you

830
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,840

on my alternate and my voice is so loud

852
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,560
mummy thank you for giving me a little sister you talked prior during the

853
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:10,280
selection process about keeping a list uh a list of possible candidates so

854
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,600
um i got my first choice for everyone i don't know how

855
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,960
but everyone was like first choice pick i wanted them in the agency they came in

856
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:25,560
the agency there were i would say like eight people

857
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:32,920
that were like fall back obviously azura didn't have one that was a problem

858
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:38,360
emi i was actually really worried she wouldn't accept her lore

859
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,040
she likes it

860
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,760
i was worried that she wouldn't accept the lore

861
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,400
and it's like yeah that's fine i don't care i'm like okay and then jeez she's

862
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,920
i was worried she wouldn't accept that but that's okay um

863
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,040
have any japanese corpos influenced your decision making

864
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:06,600
why do you believe there was no lid one before

865
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:13,560
uh no idea probably because you need someone who's done it

866
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,800
before to even understand like what to do and a lot of

867
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,680
guy owned corporations like in the nicest way most likely haven't been

868
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,680
streamers before and don't comprehend what you're asking people to do

869
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,800
like uh i kind of spoke about this a wee bit in the last

870
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:35,400
stream like that 80 20 split in order to motivate people you have to let them

871
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,000
earn what they're worth if you turn around and say to them

872
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,720
for every 100 dollars uh you're getting you know 20 bucks out of it you're

873
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:48,520
getting 50 bucks out of it like all that girl is going to be doing is

874
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:52,280
sitting there saying oh wow i could have made the full

875
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,480
hundred on my alt account oh wow i could have done this on my previous

876
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,280
life like that's all that they're going to sit there and think

877
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:03,880
okay like i'm we talking pure business baby i'm happy to talk pure

878
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,680
business if you want um

879
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,120
well the monthly audio releases be revealed before the month starts yes

880
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:19,080
and we need to get on top of that sadly there was a few issues

881
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,760
production wise with a few things i'm so surprised

882
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,960
turns out uh takes a lot of time to make these things happen

883
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:31,960
love artists but my fucking god can you not go over deadlines that'd be great

884
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:39,640
um but yes we will be posting monthly like what the tags are what the title

885
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,520
is um we just need to catch up like you need to give us time to breathe i'm

886
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,000
so sorry all i can ask is your patience and

887
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,600
unironically like bow emoji because uh we need time like it was

888
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:58,120
absolutely hectic on debut we were exhausted in that group

889
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:02,360
collab and like like i don't know if you

890
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:08,280
recognized like how fast we ended i was like right say bye to chat bye like

891
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,880
we all disappeared out that voice call so quickly i was like thank you guys so

892
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:17,480
much i'm gonna wait to pass out and then i ended up being really sick after it

893
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,000
um but yes we just need things to calm down

894
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,960
we're we're gonna ease into the first week everyone's got their games you get

895
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:29,400
to see their personalities more enjoy them more which is fantastic

896
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:36,840
um octopus i'm not an octopus i'm a codonfish

897
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:44,680
no call me octopus no call me squid i'm a cephalopod or a kurofish

898
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:48,680
better take your yourselves and now the things have calmed down like

899
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:55,240
the lead-up to debut is very nerve-racking like very very nerve-racking

900
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,600
i have finished my kola i will never start on

901
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:03,400
fame my warble

902
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:09,800
oh i strongly you're super good

903
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:15,400
hey you like my teeth is that what's doing it for you

904
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:20,040
um but i think i've called for for the question

905
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:24,760
oh no i lied is there a reason you went with youtube over

906
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,680
twitch yes i can manage the girls accounts from youtube i cannot manage

907
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,640
the girls accounts from twitch can't do a thing on twitch

908
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:38,920
management-wise um and twitch uh unfortunately are very sparse and

909
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:43,320
arbitrary when they uh throw the old band hammer down or

910
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:47,640
suspension hammer down uh really not a fan of twitch doing that

911
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,560
it's every week you see a girl being like twitch with a heck

912
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,240
i'm literally doing everything that everyone i'm doing stuff that everyone

913
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:01,240
else does um like it just at least with youtube you

914
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,320
can like beg them on twitter for help or whatever

915
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:09,560
and twitch is inconsistent yeah let's see

916
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,880
uh would you dominate inkling

917
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,960
i've never played splatoon isn't actually good it's probably like the most

918
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,040
war-friendly game for me to play

919
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,160
um

920
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,920
how does managing account yeah so i have it sounds really bad but i don't do

921
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,680
anything on their accounts but um i can basically go on their

922
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:38,120
accounts and set up streams for them or approve of comments for them

923
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,840
um anything they want to help out really like um now that

924
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,000
debuts have happened the girls are like gonna be controlling all that stuff

925
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,600
like they'll be doing their live streams and stuff but in order to reduce

926
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,160
as much stress as possible and the girls i pretty much tried to do every single

927
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,280
little thing but now that we're past the debut

928
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,960
stage like they're they're gonna have to be big girls now and

929
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,400
you know put up their put up their little games

930
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,240
put up their streams and all that and update their description

931
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,560
like i was the one doing all that behind the scenes

932
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,640
um have you played pokemon yeah pokemon ruby

933
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:23,800
my childhood game um mudkip was my starter

934
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:27,080
they have to spread their big girl wings yes i like putting a message in the

935
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,040
discord i'm like i'm so sorry girls but the hand

936
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,880
holding kind of slows down now

937
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:39,160
um yeah say hello

938
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:45,160
it was torsik blaziken is so strong and so is mudkip mudkip's really strong as

939
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:49,880
well um mudkip's always used in speed runs for pokemon

940
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,720
ruby or emerald she doesn't know i want to collect

941
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:58,920
her ink oh my god inks on you strongy is mama bird but it's time for them to

942
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:03,800
flee the nest honestly like um i hope overall they

943
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:09,480
feel like less stressed like um they didn't have to think about the

944
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:13,000
lores or what they wanted to say everything was edited on their behalf

945
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,360
like they had to give the audios over but everything was done on their behalf

946
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:23,240
and because like i've heard stories of like other agencies like go to the

947
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:26,520
tablet right make up your lore we've ordered all the art but you make up the

948
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,360
lore by the way and it's like what you literally are handing me the model what

949
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,240
do you mean you've not thought this stuff and it was like quick come up with

950
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,120
a description of your character really quickly quick quick

951
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:42,040
uh and it's like what you you're giving me the model what do you mean i come

952
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,520
up with the stuff like that's the whole point of the model unless it would be

953
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:49,400
customized like it's like um

954
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,560
how did you end up managing them or are you new to the agency well i'm new to

955
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,600
being a manager i'm not even their manager i'm just a streamer that does it

956
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:01,720
alongside them i just picked them but but me me now i want to

957
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:06,920
screen i'm fucking being a boss i ain't doing shit

958
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,920
um

959
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,920
yeah

960
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:18,280
um i know this isn't it someone said it someone said say purple burglar alarm

961
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,560
got it i knew someone was gonna say it i'll always guess this

962
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:27,400
right so in my like clear accent i say purple burglar alarm but if i say it

963
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,560
in a harsh scottish accent purple burglar alarm

964
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,000
like my tongue gets caught on the top of the roof of my mouth wait i'll mute

965
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,880
my background music so you can really hear it my my tongue gets caught

966
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:46,040
purple burglar alarm like ooh purple burglar alarm

967
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:52,440
you can hear my tongue getting caught say that

968
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,480
uh

969
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:07,720
what did you miss nothing it's just me meamin about

970
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,920
are you all trying to keep non conflicting schedules sadly it's not

971
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,800
possible when someone like me is on the team

972
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:19,320
um so whenever uh gen mate of mine goes live i will highly recommend you go

973
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,200
watch them because right now for example she'd be caught in bum is live

974
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,400
dinner 2.0 uh azura is coming on in roughly three hours

975
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:32,360
um but sadly i am an endurance streamer and the best time slot that i have

976
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,280
selected means i can go to doctor's appointments even if i do

977
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:39,800
um no i'm not dying before anyone freaking types that

978
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:45,320
i'm fine my health is good um uh it's all good don't worry

979
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:49,720
um but the time slot i have chosen means i can still go out to do

980
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:53,320
things like go shopping or to a doctor's appointment

981
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:57,080
or um you know go feed gammy you know how it is

982
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:01,320
i'm not dying stop my health is so much better

983
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,080
although i do have a sad story i mean i won't say it in 2.0

984
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:10,200
even though it's just all right well no i'll keep it to myself because it's a

985
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,680
bit sad and i don't i don't want to make you guys sad

986
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:15,800
like this is such a good happy time like holy fuck we're back

987
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,760
um after a year god damn that took so long to cook

988
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:24,840
but we're strongy cut with me that's just my name

989
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:31,320
admit it that's just my name um but yeah sadly i am an endurance

990
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,720
streamer which means weekly i will most likely have very long streams that are

991
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:41,960
not friendly to the majority of viewers please understand do not feel bad

992
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:46,040
um if you are unable to watch me live

993
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:51,880
um the other girls uh might be much more accessible to you time zone wise or

994
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,680
stream wise um i can still hear her

995
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:00,440
um but i play i absolutely do not feel insulted

996
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:06,600
at all if you cannot um you know keep up with me i'm not very friendly my

997
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,800
time zone isn't friendly i am aware of that and because i'm an

998
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,680
endurance streamer like tomorrow's stream is

999
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,960
literally eight hours long i'm not even kidding

1000
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,320
we're doing the full playthrough of assassin's creed brotherhood

1001
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:23,080
and then we're going back to 100% it because i've never 100%

1002
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,440
in the dna sequence since assassin's creed brotherhood before

1003
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:30,040
like that's what we're doing the next day what do you mean

1004
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:34,680
i thought you just debuted

1005
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:42,920
um so yeah that's uh why um whenever a gen mate goes live please you are more

1006
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:47,000
than welcome to tell me i will direct you guys to the gen mate because i can't

1007
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,600
redirect because my stream my gate if my stream isn't over

1008
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:55,480
um so full point through first day is planned yes and then 100%

1009
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,840
the next day i don't know how long it's gonna take but yeah

1010
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:03,720
um eight hours isn't going to be the norm every single stream so like for

1011
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,160
example oh for example

1012
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:13,240
uh um for example needy streamer overload

1013
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:19,160
um is two hours long i think i've never played the game before

1014
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,400
i think it's just a click simulator type thing i'm not sure

1015
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:28,840
um i've also got uh however actually um

1016
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,680
james cameron's avatars an eight hour stream

1017
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:39,400
sorry uh old school runescape is like 12 hours oh god

1018
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:43,960
these are all so long like i've got to i need to make up for lost time

1019
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:51,000
okay i need make up for lost time um not to mention uh once i get membership

1020
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,440
once i get monetized i'm also doing membership streams

1021
01:17:54,440 --> 01:18:00,600
on top of all of this um it's a more stream on saturday um

1022
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,880
and then i'm trying foreign sweets it is gonna be

1023
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:11,240
like a uh hand like a desk cam oh yeah oh you get to see my desk man

1024
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:18,760
um when do you rest i will rest until i'm dead i've waited a year to be here

1025
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:24,360
i have lost time to make up for um people have waited in cryo freeze for me

1026
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:29,240
for a very long time and the way i say thank you is

1027
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:33,080
rather than saying thank you is like doing it through content through ASMR

1028
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:39,000
through collabs through everything so yeah

1029
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,600
i'm making up for it oh no uh someone says don't burn out please

1030
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,360
i have a secret for you i have this thing your honor

1031
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:55,400
it's called rotism and it means i actually don't experience burnout

1032
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,640
i don't experience it i basically go to sleep

1033
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:03,320
and wake up the next day i'm ready to take on the world again

1034
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:08,280
uh i've never really felt what burnout is the way people describe it

1035
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:14,760
nope nope i think uh my autism has given me a buff um

1036
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:19,960
and means i don't get burnout and i'm very excited to stream every single day

1037
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:26,040
it's a superpower um yes for the foreign sweet stream again that's

01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:48,200
e what do you think of sunken gallery

1124
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:54,200
i'm not convinced

1125
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:59,720
such probation i know i know i know i know was that the melody of legend of

1126
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:12,200
zelda

1127
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,560
um will you get multiple endings there's multiple endings

1128
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:20,920
i've never played i actually don't know much about the game i thought it was

1129
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:25,000
like you click buttons that's all i know

1130
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,200
that you click buttons you'll never get i'm really good at

1131
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,840
clicking buttons you know what i'm saying they're all bad endings

1132
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,760
oh no there's tons of endings i thought it was like one of them

1133
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,400
quick games

1134
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,960
how did you end up getting to pick the talents

1135
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,960
when you're just new to the agency zelda

1136
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,560
because i'm the creative director

1137
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,600
i'm the creative director

1138
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,760
good ending is when you get your mask no

1139
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:06,760
oh okay maybe take your mask

1140
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:14,200
and the voices go away no don't take your mask i don't want to play elton ring

1141
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:18,120
and then take my mask because then you guys all disappear

1142
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,400
oh my god do you remember that time we played elton ring

1143
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:25,320
and we all like we're mimicking something

1144
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:29,880
and then someone came in and went banzai and blew it all up

1145
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,960
that was amazing how big is the viewer game

1146
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,960
i mean it depends if you want to count contractors as well

1147
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,560
i guess it's pretty juicy if you want to count contractors

1148
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:45,640
like we've literally got like four more technical clippers coming in

1149
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:49,560
no one person's about to be on trial

1150
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,560
two are like we want them full-time basically

1151
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:58,440
so that adds more people to the website

1152
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,640
do you count the talents as well that's another six then

1153
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,800
technically if we disappear who will stream site

1154
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,440
oh yeah one of you guys have to come in as the baddie

1155
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:11,480

1157
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,680
oh no i'm gonna have to know you about that

1158
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:22,440
it's a bit too aggressive

1159
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,760
are there any big group projects yes oh my god

1160
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:30,680
there's such big group projects i'm so tired

1161
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,720
i planned ahead i planned every month there's going to be

1162
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:38,040
some sort of event going on at the allure

1163
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:44,040
um leave my noodle arm i don't know why my arm breaking

1164
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,400
i'll annoying nari about it nari was absolutely fantastic when she came to

1165
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:52,040
construct in me she's fantastic um you plan on getting 3d models yes but

1166
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,040
you're gonna have to put your money where your mouth is if you want to see the

1167
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,960
girls 3d put your money where your mouth is give them

1168
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:59,240
memberships uh go on them patrons because

1169
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:04,520
that's expensive expensive because uh we would have to buy them the trackers as

1170
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,800
well i actually don't know much about 3d in yet but i'm

1171
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,440
pretty sure like you can be our chat model and we can all like

1172
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,640
touch each other and stuff in there

1173
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:22,440
uh will there be group audios yes there will be group

1174
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:26,520
audios um there's already one-on-one audios planned

1175
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:31,400
with each other but i didn't know the comfortability level of the girls when

1176
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:35,880
we were like at that stage of development so so far

1177
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:41,640
is hasura and sheepsters me and mersey and emmers and

1178
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:45,240
icers um i've not done anything further i think

1179
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:50,200
donathan rewards uh will most likely be targeted at that stuff and it'll be

1180
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:55,720
access free to access um because i think public

1181
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:59,960
donathan rewards are much more satisfactory obviously we will have to

1182
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:04,040
do the classic uh like first place second place third

1183
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:09,000
place um because we do need to incentivize and um

1184
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,440
azura um uh might be in the position to move out if all

1185
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:20,280
goes well and she gets the support um like monetary like gets monetized and

1186
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:23,000
all that jazz and if she can move out she can definitely increase her like

1187
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,840
stream times for years and uh just find a easier

1188
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,640
time uh that's why i'm kind of like support the others

1189
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,360
because like they're in positions where like oh if i could move out i could

1190
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:35,400
definitely make more content stream for longer do this do that be more like

1191
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,720
you know so definitely support them okay

1192
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:44,280
can i drill it in your head anymore to support them or

1193
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:47,720
then you like hypnotize you

1194
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:53,720
oh my picture's on twitter right okay i'll get that i'll update it

1195
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,200
and

1196
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:01,000
mm-hmm

1197
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:06,440
oh no we did not have a vealer house a vealer house would be awesome actually

1198
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:12,200
uh no the girls are like some of them are like still living with family or

1199
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:16,760
and so they can't really be like oh like you know

1200
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:21,160
all the time so yeah

1201
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:26,200
we obey we support the girls but you kindly support the girl

1202
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,080
so yeah um

1203
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:36,920
that is why um so uh azure's up first for donathan rewards to kind of give you an

1204
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:42,040
idea um i'm opening to you know farting about

1205
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:46,440
and uh being open to like kind of the stuff you guys would like to see

1206
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:50,280
perfectly fine with me no problem

1207
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,960
um

1208
01:32:54,040 --> 01:33:00,120
are the audios on patreon already done do you mean like edit

1209
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:06,440
um only one month it's been done so like june is done so the girl's

1210
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:10,120
responsibilities like contract wise is three streams a week

1211
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:14,920
if health permitted oh my god if health permitted i got asked by one of the

1212
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:19,480
girls i just azure was like did i need to give you a

1213
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:25,160
doctor's note if i'm sick i'm like no go rest my goodness

1214
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:30,840
you're not well you're not well um so if they're in good health they are to

1215
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:35,000
stream a minimum of three times a week and monthly four audios

1216
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,280
that's it i definitely do not want to overwork

1217
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:41,720
anyone i do not want them to feel stressed i want them to have good times

1218
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:49,800
good vibes uh happy ending uh yeah and they've been like super

1219
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:54,760
patient and like the behind the scenes stuff going on

1220
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:00,440
uh do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

1221
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:04,360
do you talk often with one each other yeah we're in a we're in a discord we talk

1222
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:08,040
every day for two months we've like literally

1223
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:12,920
talked every day um you know some some girls like might

1224
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:16,760
feel like awkward around each other uh we had like a couple of gaming sessions

1225
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,560
leading up to that uh we had mock streams together

1226
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:22,920
i like wholeheartedly feel a hundred percent comfortable around these girls

1227
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:27,480
um like when it comes to collabing with other vtubers outside the agency

1228
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:32,840
unfortunately for me personally i'm quite inappropriate and if i don't know the

1229
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:37,000
person and i don't know their comfort level i'm not really interested in like

1230
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,600
asking for like uh oh you want to do a vtuber club type thing

1231
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:45,240
um so uh i'm probably not going to do too many

1232
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:48,600
clubs out with the agency unless like the girls vouch for me

1233
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,440
or something like i'm i'm happy to make friends with their friends

1234
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:56,440
but um it's probably going to be solo content majority on

1235
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,520
this channel uh such as content featuring the reeflings when we

1236
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:07,240
play our multiplayer games um yeah i

1237
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:12,920
um there is a notification discord if you go on the others twitter

1238
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:16,840
uh it's notification only uh the talents are not inside it

1239
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:24,920
uh the talents uh sorry my voice is like proper feeling it right now

1240
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:28,760
um yeah management don't have access

1241
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:32,280
uh sorry contractors don't have access to the talent

1242
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:36,280
talents aren't in the notification discord there's no way you can groom

1243
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:40,440
us we groom you

1244
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:50,680
why am i freaking frog blanking it's me it's probably not set up my parameters

1245
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:57,240
one thing get more stable with the group discord for

1246
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:01,160
watchers to be joined on the table what are you saying

1247
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:04,840
i have no idea what you just said to me

1248
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:08,040
will you hang out say together outside of the collapse

1249
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:12,360
i don't even know if we're gonna have time like collabs are probably just

1250
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:15,800

01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:53,720

1258
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:56,280

now i watched like 300 people during those

1311
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,160

1408
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:19,240

01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:33,720
do do do do do do do do and that's actually real

1411
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:40,040
um so we're trying my best horror games i have a bad heart

1412
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:44,440
and don't do pause my heart is fine i got it checked

1413
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:50,600
i have to go in if there's any issues um i i can play horror games

1414
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:54,680
it's just ill advised i would probably do it as like a

1415
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:59,800
reward uh without giving the game away oh i don't want

1416
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:04,360
a game i'm playing next week are you guys ready

1417
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:09,480
i'm playing skyrim fill achievements next week

1418
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:12,440
because i know how to get full achievements in that game because i've

1419
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:15,800
done it a few times before

1420
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:21,080
um and obviously uh skyrim belongs to the north thank you very much

1421
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:27,640
i'll be here all week storm cloaks yep don't care what they say

1422
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:32,200
you know i'm all for talus praise be to talus

1423
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:36,040
um

1424
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:39,720
so that's my duration game for next week is skyrim first

1425
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:45,080
i believe it takes me just over 24 hours to do full achievements

1426
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:49,880
um we kind of you kind of cheat at the start because you do if you do the

1427
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:53,400
companions questline first and then go back to the save

1428
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:58,360
before so you're not a werewolf and then do the vampire quest

1429
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:05,880
the problem i don't know if it's gonna be a problem if i use

1430
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:13,640
um xbox pass for it because because um my xbox would break

1431
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:18,840
so many times trying to play skyrim because the save file issues

1432
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:26,120
um and i i if it's going to be the same way then

1433
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:29,960
there's a strategical way to get full achievements via the xbox i already

1434
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:33,240
know how to do it i've done it a few times so don't worry i'll lay it all out

1435
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,880
for you baby i'll show you how to get full achievements in skyrim

1436
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:40,040
in under 24 hours that'll be my challenge in under 24 hours

1437
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:44,120
i'm sure you can do it under way less but i i don't know the strength i'm not a

1438
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:47,000
speedrunner

1439
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,800
he is i had a girl ghost me because i told her you picked the stormcloth

1440
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:58,440

1441
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:02,200

1443
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:14,040

1444
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:17,640
absolutely i'm stormcloth all the way don't care

1445
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:24,840

01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:27,240
um

1447
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:34,040
being team instinct in pokemon go

1448
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:37,880

1451
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:49,880
if you follow your instincts you'll always win because it doesn't mean you

1452
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:53,400
have to win or lose just follow how you feel

1453
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:56,440
and life is good

1454
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:01,800
because team mystic is for like wise people and then team red i've forgotten

1455
