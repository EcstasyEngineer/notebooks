1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Bruh.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Everything is breaking right now.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Holy crap.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Everything has broken.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I can't even hear in-game sound.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be here in the music right now.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hold on.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm so sorry.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Everything broke from yesterday.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And my headset isn't registering sound at all.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I knew it wasn't.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're lying to me.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, the scuff isn't working.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, here we go.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, I just had to test it with some music.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can now hear the title music?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, I can.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And you can hear it too.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know how loud it's going to be though.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh my god.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Anything that can break will.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, I didn't change a single thing from yesterday's drum.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, I apologize for being late.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Little refunds.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That was horrific.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I haven't even been able to watch yesterday's words.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I know the next stream is starting.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How are we meant to keep up with your strongy?

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's the fun part.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have endless stamina.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
See, those details come really good later on.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Right, I don't, I need to, I mean,

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll tell you what world we're in.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Right now I'm entering world 424.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But I want tutorial island.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So please don't worry.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What was that first song?

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It was called Music Makes You Lose Control.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Music makes you lose control.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Please don't worry if you've not actually got your character

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
outside good ol' Lummi Castle, Lumbridge Castle.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've not even done the tutorial part.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I do.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm playing with a plugin called Runelight.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But we're just going through tutorial island super quick.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh no, I just liked it a brand new.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, we're doing an indepth in tutorial island then.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ah.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Ah.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I've actually been smart and I've prepared a whole meal.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It was absolutely chaos getting, like,

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was trying to get Runelight to work on screen

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and I was trying to cook fricking my,

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
well, technically my breakfast, but I call it dinner.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But, and I actually have, like, the world's saddest fricking rose,

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think it's called, like, rosemary sauce when you have it with shrimp.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And, ah.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, I do have membership.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
As is in the finalized world, please,

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've not even got through this tutorial.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Right, let me just skip through this fricking tutorial.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, my phone's in the way.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, my God, no.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't skip this.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is going to take so long.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, right.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, we'll talk to the survival specialist.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Look, that's what I'm eating right now.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Unironically, I'm eating that right now.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm good.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Wait a minute.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This game's based on real life.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How cool is that?

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We're going fishing.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Would you fish me up?

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Huh?

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But anyway, good morning.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Good evening.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Good afternoon.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I apologize.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's been fricking chaos.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Since there is no work tomorrow,

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm commit to catch the full stream today.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No way.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Thank you for the tip, Virginia.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There is no way.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Literally.

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, ace the con, Snow Bear June, as well.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you for the tip.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm about to munch on.

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I've got bex, pate, oh.

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Right.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And then I've got shrimp.

103
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then I've got a rose, a sauce,

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
while I've not made it correctly,

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
because I didn't fricking squeeze the water

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
out of the prawns.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hi, ready?

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hi, ready?

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hi, acey and Snowberry Raiders.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But if you put all those words together,

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
it becomes reading.

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Are you splitting me right now?

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Strony.

114
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're eating marshmallows last night

115
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
inspired me to try to write something

116
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
to make your heart flutter,

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
because I think it's adorable.

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you going to read more tonight?

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can definitely read more.

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you very much, Gramble, for the tip.

121
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, I can definitely read more.

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, I'm sorry to...

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Trying to eat and beat and vape

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and do everything all at once.

125
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hi, we're playing RuneScape,

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
an old-school RuneScape.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We're going to play multiplayer

128
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and do quests together.

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I am called Scottlefish,

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
because I totally did not steal that from a roofling.

131
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Thank you very much.

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But yeah,

133
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
we're going to do good.

134
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I am not...

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm going to move to a free world,

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but if you want to make a new account,

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
we are going to do, like, the free quest,

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
like, Cook's Assistant and that.

139
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Where the heck am I supposed to go?

140
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't know.

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not paying attention.

142
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Now that you have logged, it's time to light fire.

143
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, okay, pardon me.

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Pardon me, excuse me.

145
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to take a bite.

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Ah.

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hi, it's Trombone.

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What a nickname.

149
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I should have thrown it that bad.

150
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
See?

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I've got this plugin

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
called RuneLight.

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And, at least, it's really good.

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I think it's really good.

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If the game needs to be louder,

156
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
please do tell me.

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I actually think it does need to be louder.

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Because I'm, like,

159
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
screaming over all the things.

160
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What next?

161
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Moving on.

162
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well done.

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Moving on.

164
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Moving on.

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've completely forgotten how

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
the tutorial goes,

167
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
because it's been so long.

168
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'ma take another bite of my food.

169
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But, yeah, if you want to join in,

170
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
don't worry, you can literally

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
make a character right now

172
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and be faster than me.

173
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I will tell you what world we're on.

174
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We're all going to meet outside

175
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
of Lumbridge Castle.

176
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So whenever what world we'll get,

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
we will do a Chicky Lumbridge Castle.

178
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And then we'll take it one by one

179
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and we'll quest.

180
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Right?

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's start with Cook's Assistant,

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
because, obviously, this is a bit squished.

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And my goal is to get 99 cooking live.

184
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Like, not in this one stream.

185
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay, not in this one stream.

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

187
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know how to do that.

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Although, I think of Fletching.

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If you have, like, a ton of GP,

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
you can actually get 99 Fletching

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
in one day or something like that.

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't remember.

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I think it's Fletching.

194
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You can kind of smurf of it,

195
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
smurf of the cheese of it.

196
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All in one stream, crazy.

197
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, no, stop getting hype.

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's not happening in one stream.

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay, quest journal.

200
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yep, you're going to do the free quest first

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
as best as we can.

202
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And then we might move on to membership quest,

203
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
but I do want to give Beefling the chance

204
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
to come hang at Lummi Castle, the glum castle.

205
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Any, any lummers?

206
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Any hashtag, a lummer?

207
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm taking a little bit.

208
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's super expensive for a member.

209
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, it's really expensive, actually,

210
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to do the thing, but, um,

211
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
membership in this game is so expensive.

212
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I remember

213
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I asked my mum

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
to buy me membership when I was away,

215
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and it was, like,

216
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
cheap as anything, and she never got me it,

217
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
because she didn't understand what the game was,

218
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and she was like, why do you need it?

219
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why do you need it?

220
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm like, mum!

221
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want membership!

222
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ryan!

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No way!

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Are you...

225
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You must have been so many iron reaper

226
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that I managed to get an eight hour sleep

227
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
after that stream.

228
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know how long the endurance stream...

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It was, like, three quid the last time I got it.

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Honestly, I remember, like, begging my mum,

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was like, mum!

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I want membership, but she never understood my games.

233
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And then that's when I go to Dad.

234
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
See, Dad, Dad knew.

235
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Dad knew what was going on. He knew the games.

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Mum and Dad!

237
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What were we doing?

238
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not talking, I'm right.

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hello, my name is Skullfish!

240
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I still live.

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I usually sleep four or five.

242
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You guys all insomniacs, I got four hours.

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Good enough for me.

244
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Bro, that's not healthy, honestly.

245
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I woke up and I felt sick today,

246
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and I was like,

247
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
is that because

248
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
you will be told to equip items later?

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You don't have access to the interface for equipment items?

250
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, okay, one more, thank you.

251
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Right, shovel on now.

252
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh, okay.

253
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

254
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Brian!

255
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No!

256
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, I actually quite like that sentiment.

257
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you, Tim Shortle.

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think Tim Shortle's the way I'm supposed to say it,

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
because there's no way it's like any other way.

260
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Right, let's go.

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Combat interface, right?

262
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

263
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, beautiful, let's stab.

264
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Give him a little stabby stab.

265
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Damn rats.

266
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
All right, hold on, hold on.

267
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Nope, too far, too far.

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Inbought, inbought.

269
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I...

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Whenever I've watched RuneScape Streamers,

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
they're always super zoomed in.

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They're like, oh yeah, look at that.

273
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And I'm like, bro,

274
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I need to be able to see what I'm looking at.

275
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I can see the health bar,

276
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can see everything,

277
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and we battle down the area.

278
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm not setting anything up

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
before anyone complains.

280
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Chat sleep.

281
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Chat needs to rest as much as me.

282
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I've got absolutely no sleep at all.

283
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you all insomniacs?

284
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're all...

285
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Literally all holding on for the ASMR stream.

286
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm getting my nails done

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
after the ASMR stream.

288
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I hope you're all ready.

289
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

290
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh no, wait, sorry.

291
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm supposed to do range weaponry.

292
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Can I do it from through the gate?

293
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, I can.

294
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's cheating.

295
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Didn't realize old-school room shape...

296
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, didn't realize old-school RuneScape membership is 8'9".

297
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No!

298
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Bro, the inflation has hands.

299
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry, but...

300
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
All these things being like,

301
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
oh no, cost of living.

302
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well, you're not paying your pay...

303
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're not paying your employees more.

304
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So I don't know why we're pretending

305
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
the cost of living is a thing

306
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
for these companies.

307
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's it also.

308
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're doing your nails

309
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
for the sweet-eating stream.

310
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Uh, yeah.

311
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
How else are you going to, you know,

312
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
do my hands?

313
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You need to be able to imagine

314
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
my hand wrapped around...

315
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's terrible.

316
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We're just started.

317
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was doing a lot of food filming.

318
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh my god, I'm rich!

319
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm rich!

320
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We're rich!

321
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I've got 25 coins.

322
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you squeezing me right now?

323
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Brian!

324
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's because I had problems sleeping.

325
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Thank you for the tip, Tharya.

326
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh my god.

327
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right, so you can do voting.

328
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Like, if you're like hardcore,

329
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
well, it's not really actually,

330
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
but it's actually quite quick to get the...

331
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, I've just skipped past the bit that tells you.

332
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, what should we vote on?

333
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Should Firelight a new level 77 demon bait?

334
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Bro, I...

335
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I've not...

336
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Whoa, these are like the same question,

337
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but different.

338
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I have not...

339
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I have not played enough RuneScape.

340
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm like the basic RuneScape part, okay?

341
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Before you think I'm going to start getting prayer pots out,

342
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm going to start, uh,

343
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
what is it called?

344
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Like, PKN.

345
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No, I'm not PKN.

346
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm not doing that.

347
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not happening.

348
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No, I'm called Squatfish.

349
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I've got membership 30 days left.

350
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, no, you can't see it because I'm a big ass, hey.

351
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Who's grabbing this?

352
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What world?

353
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay, world can hold 2,000 members.

354
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay.

355
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We're very lucky,

356
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
but I don't think there's 2,000 recently

357
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
available at StreamSnipe.

358
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So, uh, the good thing...

359
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh god, it's probably a bit too heavy.

360
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Please don't show my email and password.

361
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That would kind of suck.

362
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But then again, let's just throw away the purpose.

363
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
On the way to victory, to victory, to victory.

364
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm on the way to victory.

365
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So, into the church I go.

366
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hello, mister...

367
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hello, Mr. Brace.

368
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Any bracers?

369
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What is PKN?

370
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Player killing.

371
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's when you attack players

372
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and you sell the goods that they drop, basically.

373
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But, uh, before anyone thinks I'm going to turn into PKN,

374
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
yeah, good luck, mate.

375
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's what happens.

376
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm doing this tutorial right now.

377
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm going to eat my food outside Lumbridge

378
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
so everyone can get a chance to group up

379
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
if you want to start on a new account

380
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
if you can go questing together.

381
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So please don't panic if you think, like,

382
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
oh no, I've not got enough time to join in.

383
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You absolutely do.

384
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I am going to make it so.

385
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I eat my foodies.

386
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I've got a cola and two bottles of water with me.

387
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Um, as for those of you interested,

388
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
if this is, uh, an...

389
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Where the heck?

390
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh, it's...

391
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Where the heck am I supposed to go?

392
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's not blinking anything.

393
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm grabbing the booze.

394
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You will be shown how to cast spells.

395
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
When you get there, just talk to the magic instructor.

396
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I assume you can hear them.

397
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, of course it pops up.

398
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What are we doing?

399
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll hop on.

400
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We're going to just do basic questing

401
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
because I've started a fresh account

402
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and we're going to try and get 99 Kooten.

403
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
However, open up your final menu.

404
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Ah!

405
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Am I done?

406
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay, not yet.

407
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We're about to teleport to Lummi

408
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and then I'll pick a free-to-play server.

409
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Um, and...

410
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh my god, I'm casting the chicken.

411
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You wouldn't cast the chicken, would you?

412
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Would you?

413
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Who goes there?

414
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Everyone has some when you trust a lure into the world, eh?

415
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Can I?

416
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm so sorry, but I'm going to confess

417
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
my biggest sin,

418
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and you guys honestly aren't ready for it.

419
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I used to be double in money

420
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and take people's money.

421
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The biggest amount I ever took was 100K gold

422
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and then I stopped.

423
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know how I didn't get banned.

424
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I think because I did it in such low increments.

425
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Um...

426
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Right, send me to the mainland.

427
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm so sorry.

428
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I used to be the one at the Grand Exchange.

429
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I was like a little kid

430
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
because what happened was

431
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I got fricking scammed.

432
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hey, Scottfish, come over here.

433
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Adventure or John?

434
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Um, I got scammed

435
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and then I realized, wait,

436
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I can just scam other people

437
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
to get my money back!

438
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Double in gold!

439
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Double in gold!

440
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And I'm like, I got all the money I lost back.

441
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's time.

442
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Officers, it's her.

443
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Literally, I was like a little

444
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
nine-year-old hustler, like,

445
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
like, oh, it's terrible.

446
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So if you ever got done at the Grand Exchange

447
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
because you were a silly, silly McGee,

448
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
guess what?

449
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It was probably me!

450
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We're gonna hang out at this fountain

451
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
at Lummi Castle right here.

452
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We're gonna hang out at the little fountain.

453
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I am going to Swap World.

454
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Wait, why is it flashing?

455
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's...

456
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Why it's flashing?

457
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Right, what world are we gonna go to?

458
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll make it a free-to-play world.

459
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Where...

460
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
How do I...

461
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Change worlds?

462
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Whoa!

463
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

464
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think World Shifter's up here.

465
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay!

466
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Um...

467
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Free-to-play trade?

468
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No, it's got 900 people in it already.

469
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Do we want free-to-play trade?

470
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There's 900 people in it?

471
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Jagex is watching you now.

472
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They better not be!

473
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm in trouble.

474
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We're gonna hang out at Lummi Castle

475
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
until I've finished my dinner.

476
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm trying to eat it on my breakfast.

477
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Everything's set.

478
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What world do we want?

479
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Free-to-play is good.

480
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Right, we'll just do the classic

481
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
free-to-play trade-free world 301.

482
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
There's 900 folk in it,

483
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
so we've got all the room in the world.

484
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Take me...

485
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Are you sure you wish to go to World 301?

486
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes, sir!

487
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's...

488
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let's cycle!

489
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

490
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't know where the heck the reef ones are,

491
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
so we'll come a little over to the fountain.

492
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, no!

493
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What are they used?

494
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't know.

495
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We might need to...

496
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know.

497
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't want...

498
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Are these reeflings in game?

499
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Wait, wait, wait.

500
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We're gonna go over to the tree

501
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
to make sure these are reeflings.

502
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Holy crap, are they?

503
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Brian!

504
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Evening, Alessandro.

505
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Thank you for the tip.

506
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, my God!

507
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They're reeflings!

508
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, my God.

509
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, you're looking at...

510
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, my God.

511
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Wait, you guys are actual...

512
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Some of you are actual players, though.

513
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, why are you so high level?

514
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh, someone's got tiny cuttles.

515
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's funny.

516
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Wait, you guys are like actual...

517
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I miss Fauna.

518
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's such a good name.

519
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, my God.

520
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Just yummy.

521
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hello, hello.

522
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, my God.

523
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You guys are like actual skillers and stuff.

524
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Good morning, reeflings.

525
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They're saying,

526
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, that's crazy.

527
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Strony surprise attack gamers.

528
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I know, but I didn't know if you guys were going...

529
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, my God.

530
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You stole my drip.

531
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You look like me.

532
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, you guys...

533
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You get stood on.

534
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I see a Strony.

535
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You guys are like so high level.

536
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's amazing.

537
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You guys should probably teach me how to play the game.

538
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Unfortunately, we can't...

539
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What is that?

540
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why is he standing like that?

541
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What does it mean?

542
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Am I to raid him like a pony?

543
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh, the guy's got the magma cape.

544
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I've never done the magma cape before.

545
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I have a stupid snowflake account.

546
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So I won't join.

547
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What does that mean?

548
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I have a snowflake account.

549
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Steals her legs.

550
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Snowflake, by the way.

551
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What does that mean?

552
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh, my God.

553
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Look at your fit.

554
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Your outfit's so unique.

555
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You're holding a puppy.

556
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And you've got like little things going on on you.

557
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Right.

558
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
A lot of you are like over leveled like heck.

559
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What is this in his hand?

560
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
A fish.

561
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Is that me in his hand?

562
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Come on, guys.

563
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, why is your name that?

564
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh, no.

565
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Why would you rename yourself?

566
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, no.

567
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Trick or treat.

568
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Let me take.

569
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I don't think I get...

570
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We want to see what you got, Sans.

571
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Show us what you got whilst I eat my dinner.

572
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Where did he go?

573
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Wait, did he just disappear because I looked down for one second?

574
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It says you guys want to trade me,

575
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
but I don't think I can trade because I'm a new account.

576
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't think it works.

577
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I think I need to go quest and to like unlock trade.

578
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If you guys are wanting to give me anything.

579
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Is it in the stream to trade?

580
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah, like I don't think you guys can trade me anything.

581
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So don't worry.

582
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We're going to go quest and RIP, yeah.

583
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Wait, I'm getting the fish.

584
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's so many riblings.

585
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hello, riblings.

586
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Thank you, everyone that can join.

587
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yo, we're deforestation out here.

588
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, they leveled up. Let's go.

589
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay.

590
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Trick it is.

591
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Jeez.

592
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah, look.

593
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Accept trade.

594
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't think you can trade because I'm a new, new, new account.

595
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What?

596
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Are you giving me?

597
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
A rope and a fish?

598
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Are you telling me?

599
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Are you doing that?

600
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
No way.

601
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You can trade that.

602
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No way.

603
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I have a fricking rope in my inventory right now.

604
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Wait, can you only give me like World 301?

605
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah, this world is full sad.

606
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Why?

607
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, the world is full.

608
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay.

609
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Wait, wait, hold on.

610
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Right, we're going to move to...

611
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We're not doing...

612
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know what these are.

613
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The regular bought items can't be traded.

614
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay, we're learning.

615
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Right.

616
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The world is full, so we're going to go to an emptier one.

617
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Everyone get ready.

618
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
High risk world.

619
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, no thanks.

620
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I have a bow.

621
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Is there like a really easy one we can get inside?

622
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Clan Wars?

623
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't know.

624
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Do we get grouped on?

625
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Are we technically a clan?

626
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
No.

627
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
These are just dead Oz servers apparently?

628
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Are these American?

629
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
380.

630
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Someone says 380.

631
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Hold on.

632
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
380.

633
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Right.

634
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
World 380.

635
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And we're going to Brit Bungland.

636
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Right, let's go 380.

637
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
World 380.

638
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Wait, I'm double clicking.

639
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Let me go.

640
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
380.

641
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Grand exchanges limited to until you do quests or play for a while.

642
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Now you have the fish.

643
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're canonically strong.

644
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay, okay.

645
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh, look at the replays.

646
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay.

647
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
World 380.

648
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
How do you dance?

649
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh my God.

650
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's been so long.

651
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
How do you dance?

652
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I want to dance too.

653
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I can dance.

654
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sure I can dance.

655
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hold on.

656
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Let's go.

657
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Grand.

658
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Little dance.

659
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Look at that.

660
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Look at that.

661
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Look at that.

662
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Look at that.

663
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What?

664
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What?

665
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm stunning on them.

666
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm stunning on them.

667
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Look at them.

668
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Whoa.

669
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What in the pivot axis was that?

670
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That was awful.

671
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Don't ever do that again.

672
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Right, we're clapping.

673
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay, now dance honestly.

674
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Grand exchanges limited to 8.

675
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's not a clan.

676
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's an army.

677
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh yeah?

678
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Will we do the refland clan and we'll go pk'ing like other clans or something?

679
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
As if I know how the combat works.

680
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This only world where the text matters is PvP, high-risk, total and demo.

681
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Right.

682
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Are you ready to do the first official quest?

683
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Or I say that as if I've even hardly eaten any of my dinner.

684
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Hold on.

685
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm trying to eat but I'm such a blabbermouth.

686
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Honestly.

687
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I can't stop.

688
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm glad the refland's not stacking into one space.

689
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Astroni can appreciate them each.

690
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

691
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm still convinced that guy wants me to ride him.

692
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Because he's like a horse, literally.

693
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm so cute.

694
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Still got people doing tutorials.

695
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah, don't worry if you're still doing tutorial island.

696
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm gonna inhale my dinner really quickly.

697
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm gonna try my best.

698
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What is that noise?

699
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You're all making noises.

700
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I can't believe it.

701
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm driving the bug.

702
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm still trying to log in.

703
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You're not giving people time to do the tutorial.

704
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Only the players flexing their heads.

705
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
How many?

706
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh my god.

707
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, that's just an MBC hand.

708
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh, someone just leveled up.

709
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Look at how high level you guys are.

710
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Literally got the pepper, the frog over there.

711
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I love mummy.

712
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh my god.

713
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Sad.

714
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Like you're your name.

715
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Just Yome.

716
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You guys are like actual gamers.

717
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh my god.

718
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You're much better than me.

719
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm like scared to play the game.

720
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm like you guys are gonna show me off.

721
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Quality player is determined by their agility and rune crafting level.

722
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

723
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
No one likes rune crafting.

724
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You're not selling it here.

725
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Get your propaganda useless out of here because you're not.

726
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Rune crafting is the worst.

727
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Unless you literally have an entire army behind you to help.

728
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It ain't happening.

729
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
At the end of the stream you'll be that high level.

730
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Ah, I think not.

731
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, I need to have agility.

732
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
89.

733
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You're really good at going in a circle then.

734
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Jeez.

735
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
My brother was a Rinscape essence slaver for years.

736
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Do you pay to like carry the thing?

737
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Just don't please tell me.

738
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Banks are for squares.

739
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Are you an iron man?

740
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh, so there's different types of players you can be.

741
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
If you're an iron man it means you don't have access to bank or something like that.

742
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Guardians of the Rift is experienced also.

743
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's also experienced.

744
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So will this be a 28 hour marathon?

745
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
No, no, I don't think it's a marathon.

746
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I said yesterday I thought it was a marathon but I woke up and I don't actually feel that well today.

747
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I can't believe it.

748
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I can't believe streaming for 12 hours making me feel a bit wonky.

749
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I don't know why because essentially I would sit at the PC and work on like it and for like ASMR or something like that.

750
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But why is it when a streamer feels sick?

751
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Like it doesn't make sense.

752
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I feel weak in stream height honestly.

753
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Free cuttlefish mustache rights here.

754
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
That's awful.

755
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, how did you...

756
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What?

757
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Ah, are you just cuttlefish right in front of us?

758
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I didn't know Rinscape had emotes like this.

759
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
More active for streaming.

760
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Maybe because you did it three times this week.

761
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Me?

762
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Isn't every strong stream technically a marathon honestly?

763
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Damn, how does one become an essence run slave?

764
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's good money for that hour.

765
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The members emotes go hard.

766
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Strong party.

767
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Heck yeah.

768
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
There's so many reflings.

769
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The servers are like who on earth are all these people?

770
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
D refling.

771
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'll read out your name if it's refling related,

772
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
but I was trying not to accidentally say anything.

773
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Who is leveling up there?

774
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Freaking...

775
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I can hear someone leveling up and it's always going doot doot doot doot doot doot.

776
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Hello?

777
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Jack the Ripper's coming to get us lads.

778
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
We're done for.

779
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Maybe it was your screaming yesterday, bro.

780
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I was so annoyed.

781
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I listened back.

782
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I didn't realise how angry I got.

783
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Like I got angry.

784
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Wow.

785
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh, it's a skill cape or more?

786
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh my god, he's got the fishing skill cape.

787
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Ah, jacquem prongs.

788
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Jacquem prongs, wee wee.

789
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What is this freaking UFO over here?

790
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What is that?

791
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, is that prey?

792
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Is that questing?

793
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You've done all quests.

794
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh, you've got all the jelly.

795
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh my god.

796
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Wait, what's the cooking one?

797
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Does anyone have 99 cooking?

798
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What's the cooking or more?

799
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Oh, I can't wait to get it.

800
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Oh, look at us all.

801
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Well, binchinning.

802
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Binchinning.

803
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
How do I change servers?

804
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Um...

805
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm on the runelight, so it's plug-in, so it's up here.

806
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But if you're not on the runelight plug-in,

807
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
it's...

808
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Down the bottom somewhere.

809
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Smile.

810
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It's on the cog, I think.

811
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I have two baked potatoes.

812
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I've not even finished the first one,

813
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and it's frickin' totey.

814
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Like, it's so small.

815
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm trying so I can't eat and talk,

816
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and it'd be entertaining at the same time.

817
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Quest cape, quest cape.

818
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Ah.

819
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Max capers shaming us all.

820
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Click the top right eggs, then you'll see worlds switcher on the bottom.

821
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
The door icon to hop worlds is what they're saying.

822
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Refillins are so MLG pro, honestly.

823
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Like, we're not even gay people.

824
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh, you're so green!

825
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
This refilling's, like, literally so green.

826
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's amazing.

827
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Maybe we should...

828
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Amala to tell us to all go buy green capes.

829
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
For strawney.

830
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And then we all just walk around with green capes,

831
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and, like, whenever we pass someone, they'll be like,

832
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
huh, what's going on over there?

833
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Why are they all doing their thing?

834
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Wishes to trade with you.

835
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So, I can't accept anything outside of, like, regular trades.

836
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I know.

837
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You get...

838
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You're giving me your crusty cum sock.

839
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
No!

840
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
No!

841
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Wait.

842
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I have a crusty cum sock on my inventory.

843
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
How did you even get that?

844
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Okay.

845
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Gently used.

846
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Literally gently used.

847
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Right.

848
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm gonna eat.

849
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm gonna save maybe a five-minute countdown,

850
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and then we're gonna start with Cook's insistent,

851
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and we'll take it from there.

852
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So, for those of you who haven't made an account,

853
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
we are on World 380.

854
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And we're outside Lung Bridge Castle.

855
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
When you spawn in, we are literally just...

856
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You'll spawn in this way, and we're the left of the castle.

857
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We're just hanging out here,

858
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
because we don't want to bother anyone

859
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
that might be spawning in over here.

860
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But I'm starting with the character's pink hair,

861
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
or my same pink.

862
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Mine has ginger hair.

863
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Like, I'm a junior.

864
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Which thing?

865
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And then I've got green top,

866
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and then pink...

867
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I think...

868
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Prepared to get billied nerds!

869
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm trying to eat so fast.

870
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's hard.

871
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Honestly.

872
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I hope you guys have got hydration and eating.

873
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I don't know if it's an endurance stream yet.

874
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Okay.

875
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But...

876
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Ginger hair, cute outfit, and a rope.

877
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

878
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You can get at me.

879
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
380.

880
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah, 380.

881
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The refling in the game, of course, is gonna be...

882
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Don't stop until you get 99.

883
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Bro, you think I can stream until 99?

884
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Cooking?

885
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I don't even know how to, like,

886
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
maximise cooking.

887
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The closest I ever got was, like, 80,

888
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
but I'd rather do it live with you guys.

889
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Buying girlfriend 50 gold.

890
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What happened to party hats?

891
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I don't remember people were, like,

892
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
renting party hats in quotation marks.

893
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't know what that means at all.

894
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Delicious coke.

895
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I say delicious as if...

896
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
it's just not a regular fizzy juice.

897
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Well, actually, it's, like, one of the most popular fizzy juices, so...

898
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
They decided not to have exclusive one-time items.

899
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh, even though they're tradable?

900
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I guess they didn't, like, give enough out?

901
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Possible?

902
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
They can...

903
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
They became common.

904
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Oh!

905
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
They made it common.

906
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
You go to a good place for cooking

907
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and you cook till the number says 99,

908
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
or you run out of money.

909
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
With some of the fish.

910
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Okay, you're done.

911
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh, people are getting, uh...

912
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
minigames.

913
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I was, like, I'm saying,

914
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
come along with me, Miss...

915
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I Miss Fauna.

916
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Wakey-wakey, I Miss Fauna.

917
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Max Capers.

918
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
How much playtime?

919
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
232 days says one.

920
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
314 says another.

921
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I can't believe my little...

922
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
My little reeflings are adorable little nerds!

923
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I can't believe it!

924
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You can do just a feckin' adorable!

925
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Any language game?

926
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That's so precious.

927
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm glad you found a game

928
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
that you really enjoy

929
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and can, uh, throw yourself inside.

930
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's... When you find that game,

931
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
it's really nice.

932
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Anyway, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

933
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
let's get started.

934
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Mmm.

935
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yesterday, Avatar,

936
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No Capitalist Simulator.

937
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
This is all really a trust.

938
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Someone says 63 days,

939
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and I haven't even left this area,

940
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
uh, someone says 1,650 hours

941
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
for a total of 1,800...

942
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I can't read numbers.

943
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Uh, big number.

944
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Big hours for big number.

945
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Thank you.

946
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Mmm.

947
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well, more reeflings?

948
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Have we got more reeflings joining us?

949
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah?

950
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Someone's got...

951
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, someone literally is called Swiss Oak.

952
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
A snowflake among snowflakes.

953
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Wait, what am I missing?

954
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
What is this?

955
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Is this, like, super runescape terms

956
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
that I don't know about yet?

957
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Or is this literally, uh,

958
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
take the word heart

959
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and remove the H and replace...

960
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Remove the H and E

961
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and replace it with an F.

962
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Relax, snowflake.

963
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's called Dark Humor.

964
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Is that the joke?

965
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Or am I missing Platinum?

966
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Respect for the Iron Man.

967
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Snowflake accounts are accounts

968
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
that have extremely restrictive stipulations.

969
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What does that even mean?

970
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You've somehow...

971
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You can't...

972
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Snowflake is a special account.

973
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Wait, the Venezuelans are the snowflakes?

974
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Game is not degen enough.

975
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
We need to make it harder.

976
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What the heck?

977
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Honestly.

978
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I think this girl in crossbones

979
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
means this guy's a p-care over here.

980
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm okay.

981
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Can only do content in a region.

982
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Jeez.

983
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
One guy's playing the game

984
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
where if he takes damage,

985
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
all...

986
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Oh, I know!

987
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Uh, the...

988
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Swamplet X guy.

989
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah.

990
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I've not actually watched that series.

991
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The No Hits run series,

992
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
but, yeah.

993
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Region locked.

994
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, settle!

995
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That's his name, not Swamplet X.

996
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I have still not finished

997
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
the first fucking potato.

998
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm actually getting annoyed now.

999
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Why is the food not getting away

1000
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
off my plate?

1001
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'm inhaling it.

1002
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm so sorry.

1003
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm just gonna have to send it.

1004
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I can't.

1005
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm getting too distracted

1006
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
trying to, like, talk into this.

1007
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm sending it.

1008
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
This is the fastest freaking

1009
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
eating you'll ever hear of me.

1010
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm chewing.

1011
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm chewing.

1012
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I've got another bit of potato.

1013
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I've never done this.

1014
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And, um...

1015
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay, I've had enough of eating.

1016
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm already bored of it.

1017
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I should weigh myself, honestly,

1018
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
just so I don't lose too much weight,

1019
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
because I stream too much.

1020
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I was actually wondering about that,

1021
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
because I've not had a proper meal.

1022
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm, like, ages...

1023
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Ow.

1024
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'll cut, I'll cut.

1025
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Done.

1026
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm a finger blade for my fucking plate.

1027
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I've tried to eat it.

1028
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's taken too long.

1029
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Right.

1030
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Okay.

1031
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I was trying to eat a baked potato

1032
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
in prawns, and it was just taken forever.

1033
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh, I've had enough.

1034
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Right.

1035
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Is this everyone who wants to show up?

1036
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Um, can chat, talk to me,

1037
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and tell me, is everyone here

1038
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
that wants to be here?

1039
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Talking with your mouth full,

1040
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
ASMR's running really...

1041
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It's fine.

1042
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Stop!

1043
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
If that counts as ASMR,

1044
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
then I've got a ton of content for you.

1045
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Okay, is everyone who wants to be

1046
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
questing, is in the game right now?

1047
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Is anyone in Tutorial Island?

1048
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Someone says they're late.

1049
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Okay, we'll wait.

1050
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We'll wait.

1051
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
We'll get a few more minutes.

1052
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Right.

1053
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
If we've got a few more minutes,

1054
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
it's time to start telling jokes.

1055
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Why did Ernest the chicken

1056
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
cross the road?

1057
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
To get to the other side.

1058
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Oh, thank you.

1059
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Thank you.

1060
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
If you didn't know there's a quest

1061
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
called Ernest the chicken.

1062
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Thank you.

1063
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I feel your pain.

1064
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Yes, do re-log in on your questing account

1065
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
to render the other side.

1066
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm here.

1067
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I've never opened this game before.

1068
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Okay.

1069
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
We'll stand outside the castle this time.

1070
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
We're just gonna be right outside the castle.

1071
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
If you want to start on a new quest

1072
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
on the account just to have the shizz and giggles,

1073
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
we are going to do a main quest.

1074
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh my god, there's so many reflings.

1075
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's over.

1076
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Thank you so much for joining me.

1077
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I'm being the law.

1078
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm like so fucking happy.

1079
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Like, I don't realize that like,

1080
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
oh my god, that's a lot of this playing.

1081
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Right.

1082
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Don't forget the riveting tale of

1083
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
lily pad labor dispute, honestly.

1084
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm down for some shingles.

1085
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Okay.

1086
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Why is his name erinist?

1087
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I honestly didn't know.

1088
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I can't even remember.

1089
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I hardly remember.

1090
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm here, but I've never opened this game before.

1091
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
What world?

1092
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I am on world 388.

1093
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Do mods have pinning?

1094
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Can mods pin?

1095
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
World 388.

1096
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Free questing.

1097
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I might work some unable to participate,

1098
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
but have fun, Strony reflings.

1099
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Oh, thank you.

1100
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
We will.

1101
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
We will.

1102
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't think mods can pin.

1103
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Okay.

1104
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Can I pin?

1105
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Can I pin?

1106
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Hold on.

1107
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Ow, don't, don't, don't.

1108
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Where's YouTube?

1109
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Can you open up one stream?

1110
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Strony, cartels.

1111
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Tape it in.

1112
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, I'm live.

1113
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm live right now.

1114
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Tape it in.

1115
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh my gosh, I'm live right now.

1116
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Pin message.

1117
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
There we go.

1118
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Beautiful.

1119
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Strony, after the bloke completion,

1120
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
what do you think about the bad jokes completion?

1121
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Honestly, we should.

1122
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Wish us to treat.

1123
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'll take anything.

1124
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I've got a crusty sock in my inventory right now.

1125
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Oh, should I?

1126
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You're giving me a chef's hat because I want cooking.

1127
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yes.

1128
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes, put the hat on me.

1129
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

1130
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I want the hat.

1131
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I want the hat.

1132
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I want the hat.

1133
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Check it out.

1134
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You can even see my bunches around.

1135
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Oh, look at it.

1136
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Cool.

1137
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Thank you so much.

1138
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Look at the hat.

1139
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh my God, check it.

1140
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Check it.

1141
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Check it.

1142
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Check out the drip lads.

1143
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah.

1144
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah, I'll show you.

1145
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Check it out.

1146
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh, I'm going to.

1147
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'm going to stale on them.

1148
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You ready?

1149
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
We're going to stale on them.

1150
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I got that stale.

1151
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Stale.

1152
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1153
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Hit them with the dab.

1154
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Hit them with the dab.

1155
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1156
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Oh, put it away.

1157
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Put it away.

1158
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Put it away.

1159
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Wee.

1160
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000

1161
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Level nine cooking.

1162
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Here we go.

1163
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Everyone here that would like to be here.

1164
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
This is him.

1165
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I drink za.

1166
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The thingy.

1167
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
She's cooking.

1168
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Very snazzy.

1169
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Drip check.

1170
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Certified cooking stream.

1171
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Okay.

1172
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
First quest.

1173
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Open up our little quest adventure menu.

1174
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Where the heck is that?

1175
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I can't see because the iPhone's in the way.

1176
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Excuse me, iPhone.

1177
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm here to do something.

1178
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Right.

1179
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The quest is called.

1180
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Cook's assistant.

1181
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh, oh, here it is.

1182
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'll read it out for you as for those of you that are blind.

1183
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Cook's assistant.

1184
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I can start this quest by talking to the Cook Lumberge Castle.

1185
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Difficulty novice.

1186
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Very short.

1187
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Release 2001.

1188
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Jeez.

1189
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Storyline.

1190
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Stand alone.

1191
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
No requirements and no none.

1192
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Wait, someone else wishes to trade.

1193
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't, you guys can't give me like main stuff.

1194
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I am.

1195
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm going to head to bed early.

1196
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And I'll use the stream as a sleep bed.

1197
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I hope I don't wake you.

1198
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
No way.

1199
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I've got a penny.

1200
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
No.

1201
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I have a penny as well.

1202
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Oh my God.

1203
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Wait.

1204
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Sorry.

1205
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Hold on.

1206
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Sorry.

1207
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Camera angle.

1208
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh my God.

1209
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm a real freaking woman.

1210
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh, let's go.

1211
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I look so good.

1212
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Thank you for the penny.

1213
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Thank you for the chess hat.

1214
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If you want to gift you games, how do we do that?

1215
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You don't.

1216
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I buy them with my hard earned cash.

1217
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Cold hard cash.

1218
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Right.

1219
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Let's go.

1220
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Cooks assistant.

1221
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'll turn off running.

1222
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
We'll just walk.

1223
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Right.

1224
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You ready?

1225
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Lumberge castle.

1226
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Do you mind?

1227
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I don't know.

1228
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Come reflings.

1229
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You can follow me if you want.

1230
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Wait.

1231
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Who are we fighting?

1232
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Why are you fighting that per man?

1233
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Right.

1234
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Oh my God.

1235
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Women's simulator.

1236
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Time to head to the kitchen.

1237
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh my God.

1238
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
There's so many.

1239
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Right.

1240
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
This cook is like, why are all you people in my kitchen right now?

1241
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Right.

1242
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yes.

1243
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Cook.

1244
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
What's wrong, Mr. Cook?

1245
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Oh dear.

1246
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Oh dear.

1247
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Oh dear.

1248
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm in terrible trouble with mess.

1249
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's the Duke's birthday today and I should be making him a big, lovely birthday cake.

1250
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I've forgotten to buy the ingredients.

1251
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I'll never get them now.

1252
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
He'll sack me.

1253
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
What will I do?

1254
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I have four children and I go look after.

1255
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Honestly.

1256
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Me with the...

1257
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
What?

1258
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
What?

1259
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I have five babies but one of them is a goat.

1260
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
He has four babies and a goat.

1261
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What are the odds?

1262
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yes.

1263
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
We're going to help Cook's assistant.

1264
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yes.

1265
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'll help you.

1266
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh great.

1267
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh.

1268
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
My little quest helper just popped up.

1269
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Where do I find these ingredients?

1270
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I think I remember where they are so I think we can just walk away.

1271
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Do I need to pick up a pit?

1272
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I think...

1273
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Do we need this jug?

1274
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Wait.

1275
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Are we all going to be fighting over the same jug?

1276
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Do we not need a jug for this quest to put the milk in?

1277
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Save yourself and run.

1278
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Buy eggs here.

1279
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
100 cold coins.

1280
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Sell an egg.

1281
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
No.

1282
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Do we not have to pick up the big egg and the milk from the dairy?

1283
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Am I going crazy?

1284
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Isn't that like one special big egg and one special thing?

1285
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I've got 25.

1286
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Best I can offer.

1287
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Real cheap.

1288
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
People are thinking you are doing a drop party or something.

1289
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
All the folk following.

1290
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Oh.

1291
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
No idea.

1292
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm like...

1293
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yo.

1294
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You guys have money?

1295
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I can go get some jugs and drop them.

1296
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Man's running a scheme.

1297
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I respect it honestly.

1298
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Are you guys grabbing all his equipment?

1299
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Okay.

1300
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Right.

1301
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
We can take off and get the egg.

1302
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Go to the front of the castello.

1303
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
If everyone has accepted that quest, we'll go to the front.

1304
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I think they changed it.

1305
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Okay.

1306
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Right.

1307
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Oh no.

1308
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It does look like we're a drop party.

1309
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm broke so I can't afford any eggs.

1310
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Don't worry.

1311
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm going to take you to the egg factory.

1312
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's me.

1313
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Plop.

1314
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Plop.

1315
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Plop.

1316
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Plop.

1317
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Plop.

1318
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Plop.

1319
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Okay.

1320
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh my God.

1321
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
We look like a drop party so badly.

1322
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Right.

1323
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
We're going to the river.

1324
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
The chickens aren't going to stand a chance.

1325
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Yeah.

1326
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So the cow milk and the eggs are across the river.

1327
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
If you follow me...

1328
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh my God.

1329
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Strongly lays eggs.

1330
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I was going to do ovate deposit.

1331
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

1332
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
We call these people hurting the goblins.

1333
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Il goblina village.

1334
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
We're going to milk a cow.

1335
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Milk the cow.

1336
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Milk the cow.

1337
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
We need it straight from the teeth.

1338
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You know?

1339
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,000
A normal egg works just fine.

1340
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yes.

1341
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Has YouTube ceased the culling?

1342
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I think so.

1343
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
We actually are submitting for monetization today.

1344
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Can I milk your cow or do I need a bucket?

1345
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Oh, I milked it.

1346
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But that's because I had a jug?

1347
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Wait.

1348
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Did I milk it or am I going crazy?

1349
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
She goes, Teehee, you've never milked a cow before.

1350
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
How could you tell?

1351
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Because you're spilling milk.

1352
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
What a waste.

1353
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You need something to hold the milk.

1354
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Oh.

1355
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Oh, no.

1356
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Oh, no.

1357
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Where'd you get a bucket in this game?

1358
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Right.

1359
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Right.

1360
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
We'll go get the eggs then.

1361
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Eggs first.

1362
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We'll deal with a bucket problem in a minute.

1363
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Buckets are from the tutorial.

1364
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Worked for me.

1365
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't have a bucket.

1366
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Oh, no.

1367
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I already have a bucket of milk.

1368
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
What the heck?

1369
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I already have a bucket.

1370
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I've already got a bucket of milk in my inventory.

1371
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I don't know why she said that to me.

1372
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Cheeky rat, honestly.

1373
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Egg time.

1374
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Egg time.

1375
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We go get the eggs.

1376
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
We go get the eggs.

1377
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
That's the only thing about the RuneScape plugin.

1378
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I can see the price of everything.

1379
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You guys want to watch me beat up a chicken?

1380
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That's right.

1381
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Violence.

1382
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Violence.

1383
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Rage against the machine.

1384
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Take this.

1385
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh, I just killed it with Kung Fu.

1386
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
That's right.

1387
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And I know three other dangerous ones.

1388
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I didn't drop an egg.

1389
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
All right.

1390
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Okay.

1391
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Let's all beat up the chickens and get eggs.

1392
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Beat the chickens up.

1393
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
We're going to gang violence these chickens.

1394
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Literally the whole gang of us coming.

1395
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Someone's casting Shadow Wizard Money Gang.

1396
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
We love casting spells on chickens.

1397
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh, my God.

1398
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
There's like so much.

1399
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It's just hard to see anything.

1400
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Oh, my God.

1401
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I need to like zoom right in.

1402
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Beat that chicken up.

1403
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
No, you stole my chicken.

1404
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Wait.

1405
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm going to take this egg.

1406
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Right.

1407
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I have an egg.

1408
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I have an egg.

1409
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So I'm going to stand here because I've got one.

1410
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But make sure you get an egg before you move away from this section.

1411
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Have a good day.

1412
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Hey, I'm me, man.

1413
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000

1414
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,020

00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,000

oh close the door on the refling who did that right everyone climb ladder we

1462
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,160
need to go up to the top we are not caught we promise literally people

1463
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,160
thinking it's a drop party and we're all just like harvesting right drop your

1464
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:15,120
wheat into the hopper and then you pull on the lever at the top of this wait are

1465
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:21,600
we pulling it for each other okay I think that I think it's still in

1466
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:31,000
yeah okay and then if we go down to the bottom yay it's waiting for us and now

1467
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,080
we have everything we need wait wasn't the point to have an army of slay oh why

1468
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,720
do you walk like that that's actually really freaky I'm sorry but why do you

1469
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:48,560
walk like that honestly is that like a thing why do you walk like that oh that's

1470
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,520
so creepy I don't like it feels like something that's changed like chasing

1471
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:58,200
yeah wrong lever crunk how do you increase render distance I can't see

1472
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,840
anything I have no idea I'm using runelite plug-in so I can see like this

1473
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:10,840
far but I don't need to like focus on this really wait do we need to pay this

1474
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:19,720
to be slaves no we do it for free I think to the he wants you to mount him

1475
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:25,480
ah he's scary it's thanks to the banana they're wielding the banana makes your

1476
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:32,920
legs open up oh okay okay when I said it out loud it makes sense that his legs

1477
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,280
do that is everyone got their wheat I think so

1478
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:45,120
there's slaves and then there's like I think everyone's got their wheat just

1479
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,720
to make sure all the reeflings are following yeah okay we're gonna make it

1480
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,920

1483
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,440
of my lore wheat or weed oh it's not another word that sounds the same wheat

1484
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:32,360
I'd like to harvest some wheat I'm gonna smoke some wheat

1485
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:38,120
when you're drowning we should go port sarum and vade the sea shanty at some

1486
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,800
point yeah we should but we'll literally just blast the music on film she's

1543
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,880
want to say it's sharks but sharks are so expensive because they're hard to run

1544

okay let's make sure all the reeflings that I still tell it terrifies me to this

1545

I've got one about an anagram of how I need to speak tonight. Oh my god, this music is so good. It's so good.

1899
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Someone did a base remix of Sea Shanty 2 and it's so good, I love it.

1900
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:43,000
What's the easiest mission quest that we could do? I'm not sure.

1901
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Absolute banger. I'm going to rub my...BRB, I'm going to go rub my...

1902
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Someone said rune no treasure. What are you going to quest for? You're trolling me, that's not quest.

1903
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Pirate's treasure? I don't know. I'm sure there's this headless quest.

1904
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,000
The restless ghost, I think that's it. Yeah, the restless ghost. Let's do the restless ghost because I'm pretty sure.

1905
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Okay, we need...okay, just teleport back to Lumberge.

1906
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
So open up your magic book and you should have a teleport. It should say Lumberge home teleport.

1907
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
You open up your little magic page. I don't know if you can see it over my hair.

1908
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Oh, my hair's so big. I can hardly see my inventory.

1909
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,000
But just teleport back to Lummi. We're going to do it. We're going to draw it in the ground.

1910
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Who put a cow over here? I don't even know how you did that.

1911
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Yeah, teleport to Lumberge. Open up your magic spell book and it's the very first one.

1912
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It should be on cooldown because we've been mucking about.

1913
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Okay, I'll stand here and I'll wait for my lonely thing to come.

1914
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Oh, no, I know another one. No. Get away. Get away with your stance.

1915
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Okay. Yes, your hair is big.

1916
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It is. I'm covering up my queen. My big A3.

1917
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Oh, no more silly songs. I love the way you say cow. A cow.

1918
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
A cow. How do you say cow? Who? Oh, you can also say a highland cow. That's true.

1919
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Wishes to trade with you. Hmm, what do you offer me? What do you offer me?

1920
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Tomato and cheese. Can I cook that?

1921
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
What do I do with a tomato and cheese sandwich? Yeah.

1922
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Oh, there's the cow again. Absolutely stunning on them.

1923
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Good food. I'll eat it the next time I get into a bar fight by accident.

1924
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Okay, hopefully all the reeflings made it to the teleport.

1925
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That was your first time teleporting. Who is doing a snowball fight?

1926
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Okay, let me take us to the next question. Pretty sure it's over here.

1927
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Sorry, I was bumping my desk. Have you heard that? That cow? A literal woman.

1928
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I think they heal one. That's all I need in a bar fight. One cheeky bit of health.

1929
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,000
He he he. Right. Oh, no, it's in here. Sorry, it's in the church.

1930
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I'm sorry, I'm such a fake gamer. It's inside the church. I apologize.

1931
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Father Eric.

1932
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Here, Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. I'm seeking a quest.

1933
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I'm looking for a quest. I'm looking for a quest.

1934
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
That's lucky. I need someone to do a quest for me.

1935
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended of time.

1936
01:37:49,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I'm pretty sure you don't have to fight, so we're going to send it, okay?

1937
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
We're going to send it.

1938
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Accept the graveyard through the south gate and reach the swamp.

1939
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I'm sure if you told him that, I sent you. He'd be willing to help.

1940
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
My name is Father Eric, by the way. Please come in, yeah.

1941
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Blackwax. Take her traveling through the swamps. I've heard like a good thing for us.

1942
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Okay, the stronger reeflings are literally going to have to pick on the animals that pick on the weaker reeflings, okay?

1943
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Because I'm going to get picked on as well.

1944
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I need what? Get a ghost speak amulet.

1945
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Where though? Fuck.

1946
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Is that from? In the shack up here?

1947
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,000
We need to go down to the shack. So let's go through the graveyard.

1948
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Reeflings together strong. Literally. Why is he Father Ted?

1949
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:03,000
No, because all like, all prayer men are like ire's.

1950
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I've forgotten the name of them. The prayer man.

1951
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I'm not sure if I want to go through the swamp.

1952
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I think we might need to go around. Unless we've run through the swamp.

1953
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I don't know. The music's getting different.

1954
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I'm just a small weak reefling. Yeah, if anyone gets attacked on the way, you're going to have to like help them out and stuff.

1955
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I'm getting attacked, basically. Because we're too weak for this. Get with me, swamp.

1956
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
What are you doing? Let my swamp.

1957
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Oh, a priest. Aye, that's the name. It's a priest prayer man. Completely. I've forgotten that word.

1958
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:54,000
The music. And this game's set up.

1959
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
It's not highly included either. Adorable youth.

1960
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I actually had an extended family member that owned one.

1961
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:09,000
And it was like the gentlest giant ever. I never got to meet her. It was like a female Highland cow.

1962
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
God, that's the most Scottish thing I could see. I had a family member that owned a Scottish cow.

1963
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
That Highland cow, which is, you know, Scottish.

1964
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Father Eric sent me to talk to you. I suppose I'd rather talk to you then.

1965
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,000
What problems have you got himself into this time? It's got a ghost haunting his graveyard.

1966
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Oh, that silly fool. I leave town for just five months and you already can't manage.

1967
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Sorry. Well, I can't go back and exercise it. I vowed not to leave this life until I've done a full two years of prayer and meditation.

1968
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Two years to sit on your own, bro. Right, we need to go talk to the ghost. We now have an amulet.

1969
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,000
So we're going to, you'll get given an amulet. Make sure you put it on your person.

1970
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Okay, make sure you do not waste your sprint weaker leaflings because we need to run away, like, from this fight immediately.

1971
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Two years without internet? I'd be absolutely losing it. I'm sorry.

1972
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
I'd be. I'd just be...

1973
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1974
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Oh, Brian!

1975
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Hey, Stroney, if I wanted to share a interesting prompt for you to read, but it was too long for Marshmallow.

1976
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
How would you like me to share it with you?

1977
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I don't think I'll have any other way.

1978
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Are all the leaflings coming?

1979
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Leafling, you're so, you're so behind. I'm going to have to wait for them to spawn on the other one.

1980
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
But I don't want us to get attacked by the big routes.

1981
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I'm not sure. Thank you for the tip, Anon.

1982
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
If it's big?

1983
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I think Pastebin is a safe website.

1984
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Right, let's get the heck out here for these rat scouts.

1985
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Are the frogs at the swamp?

1986
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Hey, Stroney. Hi, hi. Thanks for joining.

1987
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Two years of isolation is wild.

1988
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Literally, like, I'm sorry, but if I was isolated, I'd just straight up day and night.

1989
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:05,000
No stop and say, I'm sorry, but I gotta do something to pass the time.

1990
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Gotta do something to pass the time, so...

1991
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I do not know how that brings anyone closer to meditation.

1992
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Could a Pastebin link work?

1993
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Yeah, I think Pastebin's probably the only thing.

1994
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Right, I think we need to be ready to run away, so get ready to turn these running boots on, okay?

1995
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
But talk to the restless ghost.

1996
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Hello, ghost. How are you?

1997
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Not very good, actually.

1998
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
What's the problem then?

1999
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Did you just understand what I said?

2000
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Yeah, no, tell me what the problem is.

2001
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Woo, this is incredible.

2002
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I didn't even expect anyone to ever understand me again.

2003
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Okay, okay, I can understand you.

2004
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
But do you have any idea why you're doomed to be a ghost?

2005
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Well, to be honest, I'm not sure.

2006
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I've been told a certain task may need to be completed, so you can rest in peace.

2007
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I should think it is probably because a warlock has come along and stolen my skull.

2008
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
If you look inside my coffin, it's no there...

2009
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,000
A wreathling just closed the coffin as soon as he said that.

2010
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Okay, okay, he's missing his head. We can see he's missing his head.

2011
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
He clearly needs some head.

2012
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Oh yeah, that would be such great relief.

2013
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Okay, return the ghost's skull.

2014
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Where do we need...

2015
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
What?

2016
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,000
What? We need to go to the wizard's tower?

2017
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
What the hell?

2018
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I don't remember that.

2019
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
No way.

2020
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I don't remember.

2021
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
It's actually quite far away.

2022
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
A wreathling was to show me something.

2023
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
What do you want to show me, wreathling?

2024
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Other player has accepted.

2025
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Oh, you're giving me fish to cook?

2026
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Wait, you're giving me this now?

2027
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Wait, I think you might need to hold on to it.

2028
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Because if I die in this quest, you need to hold on to this.

2029
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Okay, hold on to it. Thank you, but you need to hold on to that.

2030
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Because if I die, I'm going to drop all of that.

2031
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:19,000
We'll do a few more quests and then we're going to actually start levelling up cooking like for real, for real, okay?

2032
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
But thank you so much.

2033
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
But do hold on to that because I'm going to end up perishing.

2034
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Looks in coffin.

2035
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
So no head.

2036
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Right, are we all here?

2037
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I think so.

2038
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
When you guys stack, it's really hard to see like if we're all here.

2039
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Hey, it's the Praise Gocher!

2040
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Bro, I feel like I'm getting lured.

2041
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Do you trust me? Do you trust where we're going?

2042
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:57,000
It'd be such a shame if you got lured to me.

2043
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Oh, someone sent me a marshmallow and they're like, I'm going to be mind broken by you.

2044
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
And I'm like...

2045
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Soon, soon.

2046
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Wait, is this not where the mage tower is?

2047
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Oh no, there's enemies ahead that attack us, okay?

2048
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Everyone get ready to sprint.

2049
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
There's wizards and robes here that are getting ready to attack us.

2050
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
At these trees up here, there's you trees.

2051
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Please get ready to run if you're a weaker reefling.

2052
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
We're going to get absolutely wrecked.

2053
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I'll tell you when to run, okay?

2054
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
But it should be coming up.

2055
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
It should be coming up.

2056
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Wait, isn't there not you logs here?

2057
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Am I too late?

2058
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Eh?

2059
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Isn't there not you logs here and wizards that beat you up here?

2060
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I guess I must be misremembering.

2061
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I'm such a fake landscape gamer.

2062
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
That's Viroc.

2063
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Oh, should be safe.

2064
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Meet you guys at the mage bank.

2065
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Take the bridge.

2066
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Let's go.

2067
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
We're not...

2068
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
We're north of the...

2069
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Okay.

2070
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Everyone's following.

2071
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Sorry, little reefling.

2072
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
You need to come around.

2073
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Jump up, jump up, and get down.

2074
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
You shall not pass.

2075
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Excuse me, pardon me.

2076
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Come through.

2077
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Pardon me.

2078
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Come through.

2079
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Oh my god.

2080
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Well fought.

2081
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Right.

2082
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Be careful, weaker reeflings.

2083
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
We must run away when we do this, okay?

2084
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Put your gold on in a minute.

2085
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Hold on, hold on.

2086
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Get ready for Friday.

2087
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Search, alter, and run.

2088
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Run like your little life depends on it.

2089
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Run on your retentacles.

2090
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Search the allers.

2091
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Search the aller, reeflings.

2092
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Reeflings scare once he spawns in.

2093
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Run away, reeflings.

2094
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Run away, run away, run away.

2095
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Go up the ladder, weaker ones.

2096
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Go up the ladder, go up the ladder, go up the ladder.

2097
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
As soon as you get the score, you need to go up the ladder.

2098
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
There's so many reeflings.

2099
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
That skeleton's getting absolutely wrecked.

2100
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
We made it, reeflings.

2101
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
We made it, we're safe.

2102
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
We did it.

2103
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
We didn't get wrecked.

2104
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I'll wait for you outside the mage castello.

2105
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
We did it today, reeflings.

2106
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
We cheated death.

2107
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
It wasn't a match for us.

2108
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Yeah.

2109
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Oh my god.

2110
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
So many of us.

2111
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
The scaly didn't know what hit him, literally.

2112
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
It's closing doors.

2113
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
You've been so mean to the reeflings.

2114
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Not only are you jacking up prices artificially,

2115
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
but you're closing doors.

2116
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Oh my god.

2117
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
There's so many of us.

2118
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Oh, he's beating up that wizard.

2119
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Oh, shadow wizard money gang.

2120
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
They love casting spells.

2121
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Death by dark wizard is a rinscape right of passage.

2122
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Honestly though, no troll under the bridge.

2123
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Yeah.

2124
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
It's normal.

2125
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Is that all my reeflings?

2126
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Did we all make it?

2127
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Hopefully no one perished.

2128
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Sailing head.

2129
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
What?

2130
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:01,000
That's a good girl's trying.

2131
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
You thought.

2132
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
You thought.

2133
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Ain't that kind of stream?

2134
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Ain't that kind of stream?

2135
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I think if I'm feeling better,

2136
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
maybe the ASMR stream,

2137
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I give permission for you to give it a try.

2138
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Right.

2139
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Okay, reeflings.

2140
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,000
All the way back to the ghost.

2141
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Oh, unless, wait, follow the rabbit.

2142
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Follow the rabbit.

2143
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
The rabbit will take us to where we need to go.

2144
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Honestly, that rabbit outfit, not going to lie.

2145
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I'm digging it.

2146
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I'm actually digging that rabbit.

2147
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Like, I mean, you can see the hips definition.

2148
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
You can see the yiddies.

2149
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
It's all looking pretty good.

2150
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And then headless refilling.

2151
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
You're at my render distance.

2152
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Whoever's back there had this refilling.

2153
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Look at the size of them grippers.

2154
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Oh, we're up.

2155
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
What is that?

2156
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Someone's got like a thing on their back.

2157
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I honestly didn't know how many cosmetics there was in the game.

2158
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
If you get us beaten up by baddies,

2159
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
because you've taken this path.

2160
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Okay, I think we're safe.

2161
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Reefling just hovering in the background.

2162
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Hey, it's constantly coming in and out of render distance.

2163
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Okay, hydration check.

2164
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I hope this taxi is better than the last.

2165
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Oh, wow.

2166
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Oh, no.

2167
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Rad attack.

2168
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Walking us to the Edgeville dungeon.

2169
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Wait, there is a place called Edgeville.

2170
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Oh my gosh, that's where we should make the home.

2171
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Oh, I was going to play hide and seek.

2172
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
And if I touch you, then you're out.

2173
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Right, where do we need to go?

2174
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Oh, we need to go to the graveyard, guys.

2175
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Yeah, there's literally a place called Edgeville in this game.

2176
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
There's a plugin for hide and seek.

2177
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Is there actually?

2178
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
That's so smart.

2179
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Maybe next stream I'll get the plugin and we'll see how it works.

2180
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
I don't know.

2181
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Hide and seek.

2182
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I'd rather lose.

2183
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
But every time I find you, all you hear is plop, plop, plop.

2184
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
And then move on to the next refund.

2185
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Plop, plop, plop.

2186
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
It's over.

2187
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Okay.

2188
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
We need to put the hedge on the coffin.

2189
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
And all is good.

2190
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
We're going to use the skull on the coffin.

2191
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Use it on the coffin.

2192
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
It's not a...

2193
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Oh, cut scene.

2194
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Release.

2195
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Thank you, stranger.

2196
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Yeah.

2197
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Oh, he's away.

2198
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Oh, he's in the water.

2199
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Oh, he's had enough.

2200
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
He's in the water.

2201
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Whoa, we got one cave prayer for that.

2202
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
That was actually pretty big.

2203
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Right, we've got four quest points now.

2204
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Jeez, we've got nine prayers.

2205
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
What?

2206
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
And I'm level four combat currently.

2207
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I didn't fight anything, though.

2208
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Hide and plop.

2209
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Yes, hide and plop.

2210
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I want to find hide and plop.

2211
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Good.

2212
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Release.

2213
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Oh, that's a lot.

2214
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Everyone's leveling up.

2215
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Rep sleeping viewers.

2216
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Yeah, sorry.

2217
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Hopefully no one actually uses this to sleep, too.

2218
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I wonder if there's also a kumbor.

2219
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Right, what's the easiest quest next?

2220
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Or are we actually going to have to level up?

2221
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I think we might have to get stronger because everything's like...

2222
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Maybe Goblin Village?

2223
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
If we buy everything in advance for that Goblin quest,

2224
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I forgot the name of it.

2225
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Romeo and Juliet is good.

2226
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Should we try Romeo and Juliet?

2227
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Romeo and Juliet.

2228
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Also an amulet that's useful for the future, right?

2229
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Stronghold of security time?

2230
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I've never done that one.

2231
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Romeo and Juliet is no needed stats.

2232
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Okay, we're going to do that one then.

2233
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I can start this quest by talking to Romeo and Varrock Square.

2234
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Who the heck?

2235
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Oh, that's a big walk.

2236
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Not going to lie.

2237
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
That's like really far away.

2238
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Not going to lie.

2239
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Okay, we cross the bridge,

2240
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
and then we just keep going all the way up to Varrock.

2241
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
I've already lost where Romeo is.

2242
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Oh, he's literally in the square of Varrock.

2243
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Well, we don't have teleport stone,

2244
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
so we're going to have to do it the old fashioned way.

2245
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I heard it drops the goal in the amulet.

2246
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I don't know what that is.

2247
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Follow, someone says follow.

2248
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Just...

2249
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Oh, oh, taxi!

2250
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Okay, follow the guy with the magma cape.

2251
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Wait, make sure we get out of the graveyard first

2252
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
because we might actually get stuck on the gravestones.

2253
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Yeah, you'll get...

2254
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Careful, you'll get stuck on the gravestones.

2255
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Okay, if you're going to tax sales,

2256
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
can I make a cup of tea?

2257
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Am I allowed to make a cup of tea?

2258
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
That little voice is getting sore.

2259
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
This is a magma cape, winky.

2260
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
It is!

2261
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Isn't that a magma cape?

2262
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Whoa, what is that?

2263
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Wait, you got a special accolade?

2264
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Is that a special accolade to this thing?

2265
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Oh, it's a fire cape.

2266
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
I mean, it looks like magma lava,

2267
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
so whoever named it is wrong.

2268
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
We...

2269
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
We must go directly into the dark mages.

2270
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Oh, wait, I can't make a cup of tea

2271
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
because I'm going to get hurt by the mages.

2272
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
For the weaker reeflings,

2273
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
we're about to pass some wizards

2274
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
outside of a rock that will attack us.

2275
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
We need to be ready to run.

2276
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Go west near the farm.

2277
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Oh, he says he's going to go around.

2278
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
I think we have enough people to kill the dark wizards.

2279
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Oh, can I go quickly make a cup of tea, then?

2280
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Watching strongy stream?

2281
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Whenever I read the last thingy,

2282
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
you know the love heart?

2283
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
You can put a love heart on stream.

2284
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Tap that love heart thing.

2285
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
It's in the way if I read the most bottom thing.

2286
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
It says, watching strongy stream is the type of accolade.

2287
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Yeah, if you tap that heart,

2288
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I can see when you tap it,

2289
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
but it blocks the last message.

2290
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I'll be doing nothing but laughing if anyone dies.

2291
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Oh, we'll also be at the bank,

2292
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
so is that reefling still there to trade the fish?

2293
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Plenty more fish.

2294
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I can only see it on mobile.

2295
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Yeah, I can see someone make a flush face smiley reaction.

2296
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
It's in the way for everyone.

2297
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Okay, right.

2298
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I was going to say, because it's in the way.

2299
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Whenever I read the most bottom message,

2300
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
it's in the way.

2301
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
That cape requires you to kill a level 700 monster.

2302
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Unless you guys can carry me through that monster,

2303
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I don't think we can do that.

2304
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I've never done it before.

2305
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Yeah, I had to nuke the heart with an edlocker.

2306
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I think you can toggle it away.

2307
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Yeah, I have to scroll around it.

2308
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
It's a solo fight?

2309
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Well, I'm never getting that.

2310
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I am here with the fish.

2311
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Okay, we will be going next to the bank,

2312
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
so we should be okay.

2313
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I think.

2314
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Is there any?

2315
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Hopefully, there's not too many.

2316
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Oh, yeah.

2317
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Good idea to go to the bushes first.

2318
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Oh, no, these reeflings.

2319
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Oh, no, don't get stuck on the wall, reefling.

2320
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
These are reeflings.

2321
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Oh, no, I don't know if that's everything.

2322
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I might just be someone.

2323
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
There's three dots at the top of chat.

2324
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
No, no, I think it's okay.

2325
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I think it's there.

2326
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Fire cape would be fun.

2327
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Oh, no, I don't even know how to do that.

2328
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I don't even know how prayer pots work in, like,

2329
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
strength potions and all of that work,

2330
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
and it's, like, all temporary,

2331
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:59,000
but they're, like, a thousand, and it's so expensive.

2332
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Watch out now.

2333
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
All right, weaker reeflings.

2334
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Get ready.

2335
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Get ready, weaker reeflings.

2336
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Stronger reeflings.

2337
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Beat them up.

2338
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Show those wizards.

2339
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
We mean freaking...

2340
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
We mean business.

2341
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Beat them up, stronger reeflings.

2342
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
We'll be...

2343
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
The weaker reeflings are going to stick together.

2344
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,000
This is the best we can do under the circumstances.

2345
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Cut off, Boudin.

2346
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Run into the circle reefling.

2347
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
No, do not go in that circle.

2348
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
These wizards are stinky.

2349
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
They're no good, guys.

2350
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
He's telling you fevers.

2351
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
He's telling you the Fibonacci sequence,

2352
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
because those are fevers.

2353
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Okay, I think the reeflings, like,

2354
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
literally eradicate all the wizards for us in a way.

2355
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Thank you.

2356
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
They're all dead.

2357
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Literally just absolutely eradicated them.

2358
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I think the funniest thing ever.

2359
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Wow.

2360
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
How can I tell?

2361
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Whoa, how many quests is there?

2362
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I don't know if we can do all the quests in just a little while.

2363
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Right, we're looking for R for Romeo.

2364
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Uh-oh.

2365
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Uh-oh.

2366
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Uh-oh.

2367
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Okay.

2368
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
We're here.

2369
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Right, who's Romeo?

2370
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Oh, Romeo's inside the shop.

2371
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Inside the shop with the green windows.

2372
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Inside the shop is where Romeo is.

2373
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
He thought he could hide from us.

2374
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Right, talk to Romeo.

2375
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Romeo.

2376
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
What?

2377
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
What is to become of me and my darling Juliet?

2378
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I cannot find her anywhere.

2379
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Have you seen her?

2380
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Yes, I have seen her, actually.

2381
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
At least, I think it was her.

2382
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Blonde, a bit stressed.

2383
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Golly, yes, yes.

2384
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
You make a sense of very interesting.

2385
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:47,000
And I'll bet she's a bit of a fox around.

2386
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Well, I guess she could be considered attractive.

2387
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I'll bet she is.

2388
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Woo-hoo.

2389
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Sorry, all that jubilation has made me forget what we were talking about.

2390
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
You were asking me about Juliet.

2391
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
You seem to know her.

2392
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Oh, yes, Juliet.

2393
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
That fox.

2394
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Could you tell her that she is the love of my long?

2395
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
What?

2396
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
She is the love of my long?

2397
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Rinse, jagged.

2398
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:28,000
She's the love of my long and that I love to be with her.

2399
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
What?

2400
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
What?

2401
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Surely you mean she is the love of your life and that you long to be with her?

2402
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Oh, yes, what you said.

2403
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Tell her that, it sounds much better.

2404
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Oh, you're so good at this.

2405
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Start the Romeo and Juliet quest.

2406
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Yeah, okay, I'll let her know.

2407
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Oh, great, and tell her that I want to kiss her a give.

2408
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
You mean you want to give her a kiss?

2409
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Oh, you are good, you are good.

2410
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I see I've picked a true professional.

2411
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Is he drunk?

2412
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Okay, thanks.

2413
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Yay!

2414
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Okay, has everyone got the quest?

2415
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
We now need to...

2416
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Actually, we're going to very quickly go to the bank

2417
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
and I'm going to young call the fish from your juicy, juicy donations to me.

2418
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Okay.

2419
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Oh, wait, sorry, sorry, wait, wait, wait.

2420
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Pause, pause.

2421
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I'm in the square, I'm in the square.

2422
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to run away so quickly.

2423
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
We're going to very quickly go to the Grand Exchange

2424
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
because I'm going to empty my inventory

2425
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
and if you want to give me anything, you can, okay?

2426
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:38,000
But I'll...

2427
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Uh, no, don't give me a bond.

2428
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I've already bought premium, thank you so much.

2429
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Don't give me a bond though, I bought premium.

2430
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Right, Reflings, if you want to follow me,

2431
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,000
we're going to go to the Grand Exchange.

2432
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:54,000
So if you want to give me anything, you can.

2433
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Get your scam messages ready.

2434
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Oh no, I need to mute public chat whilst we're here.

2435
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I might need to mute public chat.

2436
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I don't know how bad the bots are going to be.

2437
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I have no idea how bad the bots are going to be.

2438
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:21,000
I might have to mute public chat until we go away.

2439
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Buying girlfriend through...

2440
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Oh, there's like the bots aren't talking.

2441
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Okay, nothing's happening.

2442
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Right, I'm going to put...

2443
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I'm literally...

2444
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Oh no, no, I don't want to sell them.

2445
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I'm just literally going to shove everything in the bank.

2446
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Uh, I think I'll just drop the clue scroll.

2447
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Ah, you know what?

2448
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I'll just put it in the bank.

2449
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
It doesn't make a difference.

2450
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Put all my coins in.

2451
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I've got an antique lamp.

2452
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I don't know what that does.

2453
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Oh, I can't put it away.

2454
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Uh, I'll rub the antique lamp.

2455
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Oh!

2456
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Um, into kicking please.

2457
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Hey, 300 XP in kicking.

2458
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Yay!

2459
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Okay, I'm level 7.

2460
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Cooking now feels good, man.

2461
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Stand over here.

2462
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
If you want to trade me, you're more than welcome to.

2463
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I'm literally starting a farm for, uh...

2464
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
How do I accept, accept?

2465
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Okay, there we go.

2466
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Sorry, sorry, I'm dumb.

2467
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Oh my gosh, that's a lot of fish.

2468
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Oh, a 10 million?

2469
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Are you crazy?

2470
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Isn't that a lot of money?

2471
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Are you sure?

2472
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
That's a lot of money.

2473
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Oh wait, did I just accept you as a friend by accident?

2474
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Whoops.

2475
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
10 million reeflings.

2476
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Is this account going to get shot down?

2477
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Because, like, Jagex are going to be like,

2478
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
you're clearly, like, paying for these?

2479
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I got lobster!

2480
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I'm cake!

2481
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Yes!

2482
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Thank you for the lobster!

2483
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Oopsie.

2484
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
The weapon is 1.2 billion?

2485
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
That's crazy.

2486
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Sorry, I think I accidentally added a frame.

2487
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
10 million?

2488
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Isn't that not, like, a...

2489
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
How much, how much ink?

2490
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
How much ink?

2491
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
1,000 crusty socks?

2492
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Why did Jagex make that item?

2493
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
They knew exactly what they were doing.

2494
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Doubling money!

2495
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
This shmuck just made 10 million.

2496
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Doubling money, doubling money.

2497
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
That's ridiculous.

2498
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
On the contrary, we play here.

2499
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Oh, it's a ring!

2500
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Oh, can I wear it?

2501
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Am I allowed to put it on?

2502
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
It's a diamond reefling!

2503
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Oh, my God.

2504
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Wait, wait.

2505
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Can I see it on my finger if I put it on?

2506
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
No, I didn't change my persons.

2507
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I'm married to the reeflings.

2508
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
He he he he he.

2509
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Okay, what do we do on the wedding then?

2510
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
What's the honeymoon?

2511
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,000
I want to know about the honeymoon.

2512
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Fishies!

2513
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Oh, we are going to be, like, exploding.

2514
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Oh, my God, that's so much.

2515
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
We are going to be exploding once we cook all these.

2516
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Thank you, reeflings.

2517
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Oh, my gosh.

2518
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Okay, I'm going to put it all in the bank,

2519
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,000
and then we get to come back.

2520
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Come back.

2521
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
There's not one single bot here.

2522
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
That's pretty thingy.

2523
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Okay, we are doing Romeo and Juliet.

2524
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Do we need to do anything?

2525
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
We actually don't need any items at all.

2526
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Wow.

2527
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Oh, sorry.

2528
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Sorry, there's a few more that wish to trade.

2529
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
My apologies.

2530
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
My apologies.

2531
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Fishies!

2532
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Look at all the fishies.

2533
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
You can bank note these, by the way.

2534
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
But thank you for the fishies.

2535
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
We're getting so much fish.

2536
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Yes, thank you.

2537
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Okay, how do I accept this?

2538
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Oh, I'm getting grapes.

2539
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Hey, yo, you want to grape me?

2540
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Hold on a minute.

2541
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Oh, no, sorry.

2542
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
The cut of our berries.

2543
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
My apologies.

2544
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
My apologies.

2545
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It's a wedding gift.

2546
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Who did I not accept the trade from?

2547
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Is it you?

2548
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Did I accept the trade from you?

2549
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
God, great.

2550
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Wait, does Johnny come in tax fraud and runescape?

2551
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Honestly?

2552
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Oopsie, sorry.

2553
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Oh, wait, hold on.

2554
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
I accidentally added a reefling.

2555
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
I apologize.

2556
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Sorry.

2557
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
It's just because it was show.

2558
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
What's the dress going to look like?

2559
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Someone called Sweaty Socks.

2560
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Are you role-playing as my Sweaty Socks?

2561
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I actually have socks on.

2562
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Oh, it's a necklace.

2563
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
It's so pretty.

2564
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Oh, they get to put it on.

2565
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Amulet of power.

2566
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Oh, check me out.

2567
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Oh, look at that little thing.

2568
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
This puppet that you get to hurry.

2569
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
When we celebrate in the wedding

2570
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
on my alternative Twitter.

2571
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Eat cuttlefish.

2572
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Whatever, you name yourself like that.

2573
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Unless you mean the other way.

2574
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
What, you got to show me what you've got?

2575
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Eat cuttlefish.

2576
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
You know what?

2577
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Are you just going to...

2578
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Hi, Johnny, sounding beautiful as ever.

2579
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Are you declined it?

2580
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Right, I will put this away in the bank.

2581
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
And then we will finish

2582
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Gnotic and Elf and Gnotic and Oblin.

2583
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Wait, why is that not doing all...

2584
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
There we go.

2585
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Oh, that's all I needed to do.

2586
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Speaking of alt-Twitters.

2587
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
What was your reaction to them blown up?

2588
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
So, Mercy stumbled upon the algorithm.

2589
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
And then Sheebie did it.

2590
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
But I did mine too late, Rip.

2591
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
But, I mean, the video did really well.

2592
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
It got like a hundred and...

2593
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
A thousand likes on it.

2594
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
And you're really good.

2595
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Wait, are you trying again?

2596
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Did you get stage fright?

2597
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Or is that the other one?

2598
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

2599
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Right, Gnome, Gnotic and Elf and Gnotic and Oblin.

2600
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:56,000
We need to Gnotic and Elf to over to Gnor.

2601
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,000
To Faldor, I think.

2602
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I think she's somewhere here.

2603
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I don't know where she is.

2604
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Talk to Romeo, I did.

2605
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Did I not accept?

2606
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Talk to Romeo, I did.

2607
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Talk to Juliet in the house west of Viroc.

2608
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Oh wait, they're both in Viroc?

2609
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Why did I think she was in Faldor?

2610
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
And where is Gnotic and Oblin?

2611
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I'm analising.

2612
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
I'm analising.

2613
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Oh!

2614
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Eh?

2615
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
She's here?

2616
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Why would you be in there?

2617
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Okay.

2618
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Alright, let's go to the front of the Grand Exchange

2619
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
for my little refillings, front of the Grand Exchange,

2620
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,000
front centre.

2621
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
After this quest, I am going to...

2622
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Faldor?

2623
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
I hardly even know her.

2624
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Thank you, thank you.

2625
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I came up with that myself, thank you.

2626
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Refillings, I'm at the front of the Grand Exchange.

2627
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
You can find me over here.

2628
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
So we're making a clan.

2629
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Can you make a clan?

2630
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Like, can anyone make a clan?

2631
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
That video was amazing.

2632
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
All per eco fish just wanted to feel included in it.

2633
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
It got none to thingy.

2634
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
A luring clan, he even knows.

2635
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Okay, is this all my refillings?

2636
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
We're at the front?

2637
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Okay, this looks like great.

2638
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Ready?

2639
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Atten!

2640
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Up!

2641
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Two, three, four.

2642
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Up!

2643
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Two, three, four.

2644
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
How do I get in this house?

2645
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
It looks like I get in this door here.

2646
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Unless there's another door.

2647
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
No, there's a door here.

2648
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Okay, we just used this door.

2649
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Literally right over there.

2650
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Hut!

2651
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Two, three, four.

2652
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Hit!

2653
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Two, three, four.

2654
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Mine is too bad joke, literally.

2655
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Just going down ten aura, sorry.

2656
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Okay, open the door.

2657
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Hello, we would like to come inside your house.

2658
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Don't mind us, we're just...

2659
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
How have I come the hardest way to get around this house?

2660
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
There's no way!

2661
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I literally picked the most awkward door.

2662
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
I'm so sorry!

2663
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:08,000
We literally have trailed through the entire house, but the one door.

2664
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Stop pranking each other with the door!

2665
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
You're pranking me with the door!

2666
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Why is there a fisherman?

2667
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
It's a true draw party!

2668
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Get your truck, get your truck, get your truck.

2669
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
We're going to need it.

2670
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
We're going to need all the XP.

2671
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I got three, four, five, six.

2672
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
I don't know how I managed to do the worst.

2673
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Right, go up the stairs.

2674
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Up the stairs.

2675
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
It smells fishy in here.

2676
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
It does.

2677
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Right, where's Juliet?

2678
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Oh, her room's all pink.

2679
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Oh my God, you're such a girl.

2680
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
How do we know Juliet's a girl?

2681
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Hmm, it's a mystery.

2682
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Hi Juliet.

2683
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Juliet, I've come from Romeo.

2684
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,000
He begs me to tell you that he cares still.

2685
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Oh how my heart soars for hearing this news.

2686
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Please take this message to him with great haste.

2687
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Well, I hope it's good news.

2688
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
He was quite upset when I left him.

2689
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:01,000
He's quite often upset at the poor sensitive soul,

2690
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:04,000
but I don't think he's going to take this news very well.

2691
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
However, all is not lost.

2692
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Everything is explained in the letter.

2693
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Would you be so kind to deliver it to him, please?

2694
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Certainly, I'll do so straight away.

2695
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Many thanks.

2696
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Oh, I'm so very grateful.

2697
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
You may be our only hope.

2698
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

2699
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
You're my only hope.

2700
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Okay, as everyone spoke to Juliet,

2701
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Romeo and Juliet, we're just literally passing

2702
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
sextant messages, honestly.

2703
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
What's going on here?

2704
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
If you have spoken to Juliet,

2705
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
we can go back doing the stairs,

2706
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
and we're going to go back to Romeo.

2707
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Oh, Romeo, where are for thou art Romeo?

2708
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Oi, who closed that door?

2709
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I literally just smacked my face.

2710
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
My, I freaking, you closed that door,

2711
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
and now I'm tracking outside backwards.

2712
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Stop it.

2713
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Don't, don't close the door.

2714
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
You made me whack my face into it.

2715
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Stop it.

2716
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Let me out of this house.

2717
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
It keeps trying to make me go.

2718
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Right, I'm out.

2719
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I'm out.

2720
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Okay, we're safe.

2721
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
We're safe.

2722
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,000
You don't want to go through the five doors instead, honestly.

2723
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Forget doing agility training.

2724
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
It's hard enough to get out of a door

2725
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
that someone else is closing.

2726
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
What?

2727
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
How did that pop up?

2728
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
I didn't even accept.

2729
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Okay, our all reflings here.

2730
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
We're going to go back to Romeo.

2731
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
He's this way.

2732
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Hardest boss in the game, pathing.

2733
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Yeah.

2734
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Are we refling back there?

2735
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Dear Mario, please come to the castle.

2736
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Oh, did I tell you I really like this meme?

2737
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Dear Mario, please don't come to the castle.

2738
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I've baked a cake.

2739
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
It's absolutely dark shit.

2740
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I love that meme so much.

2741
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Okay, we go talk to Romeo back in the green shop.

2742
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Why is that green?

2743
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Oh, cloth right.

2744
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Which one did that?

2745
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Stop.

2746
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Stop it.

2747
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Stop.

2748
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Right, I'm in.

2749
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Who did that?

2750
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Was that you?

2751
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Was that you?

2752
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,000
You're the one who's right behind the door.

2753
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
I love Mummy.

2754
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Am I accusing you live?

2755
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Was that you?

2756
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I don't know who did that.

2757
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I don't know who did that.

2758
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Talk to Romeo.

2759
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Romeo, great news.

2760
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
I've been in touch with Big Juliet.

2761
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
She's written a message for you.

2762
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
You hand over the message.

2763
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Oh, a message.

2764
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
A message.

2765
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I've never had a message before.

2766
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Really?

2767
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
No, no, no.

2768
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Not one.

2769
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Well, except for the occasional court summon.

2770
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
But the really, really nice message.

2771
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Not like this one.

2772
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I'm sure this message will be lovely.

2773
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Yes, yes.

2774
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Where are you?

2775
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Well, are you going to open it or not?

2776
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Oh, yes.

2777
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Yes, of course.

2778
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Yes, of course.

2779
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Affection.

2780
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
She thinks I'm deceased.

2781
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Oh, affliction.

2782
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Oh, I can't read.

2783
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Sorry.

2784
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
I'm not going to get my glasses on.

2785
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Sorry.

2786
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
It says affliction.

2787
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Affection.

2788
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Oh, wait.

2789
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
No, I got it right.

2790
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Affection.

2791
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Oh, yes.

2792
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Still hold affection for me.

2793
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
I still feel great affection for you.

2794
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Unfortunately, my father opposes our marriage.

2795
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Oh, dear.

2796
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
That doesn't sound too good at all.

2797
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I want great affection for you.

2798
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Father opposes our marriage.

2799
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:28,000
And well, we'll kill you if he sees you again.

2800
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I'm going to be honest.

2801
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
It's not getting any better, me.

2802
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Our only hope is that the father Lawrence, a long time confidant,

2803
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
can help us in some way.

2804
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Romeo folds the message away.

2805
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Well, that's it then.

2806
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
We haven't got a chance.

2807
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,000
What about Father Lawrence?

2808
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Our love is over the great romance that'll life of my love.

2809
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Or you could speak to Father Lawrence.

2810
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Oh, my aching, breaking heart.

2811
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Oh, how useless the situation is now.

2812
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I've got no one to turn to.

2813
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Father Lawrence.

2814
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Father Lawrence.

2815
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Oh, yes, Father Lawrence.

2816
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
He's a long time confidant.

2817
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
He might have a solution.

2818
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Yes, yes.

2819
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
You have to go and talk to Father Lawrence for once

2820
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,000
and ask him if he's got any suggestion for a predicament.

2821
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Where can I feign Father Lawrence?

2822
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Lawrence, Father Lawrence.

2823
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Oh, you know, he's not my real father, don't you?

2824
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I think I suspected that he wasn't.

2825
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Did he get hit on the head?

2826
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Well, anyway, he tells his songs,

2827
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:52,000
luring bare moans and keep these here.

2828
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
What? I can't even read that.

2829
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Yeah, okay, thanks.

2830
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Okay, thanks.

2831
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Yeah, thanks mate.

2832
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Nice try on the English, but even I can't read that.

2833
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Where the heck are we going? Somewhere over here.

2834
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
He's just a, and then dot, dot, dot.

2835
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,000
I don't know what you typed, Reefling.

2836
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Are you trying to say he's one of us?

2837
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
For that word, he's one of us.

2838
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
No one slammed the door.

2839
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I slammed my piece.

2840
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Okay, Reeflings, we're going a little to the left

2841
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
outside that shop.

2842
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Any Reeflings left behind?

2843
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,000
There's one Reefling.

2844
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Yay.

2845
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I don't think these are all NPCs.

2846
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I love Reefling there.

2847
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I didn't close the door, but I'm ready to accept

2848
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
any punishment you do with it.

2849
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Captain Jack Thornbare.

2850
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Okay, let's go.

2851
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
We are just following the path.

2852
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
I see the blue marker because of rune light,

2853
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
so we're just following that.

2854
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
But, oh no!

2855
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Oh no, I'm going to get you strapped on the fence.

2856
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I'm sorry.

2857
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I was a bit, I was a bit preemptive.

2858
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Okay, okay, that was lucky.

2859
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Easy, take it easy, easy.

2860
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Let's not get any Reeflings caught on a fence.

2861
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Come on.

2862
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,000
We can do it.

2863
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I have no idea how.

2864
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Oh, here's the church.

2865
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Right, we're going to go to the steps over here.

2866
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Rare correct path, I think, honestly.

2867
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Going to Wildy Ditch.

2868
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Should we start attacking each other?

2869
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Should we do fisty cuffs?

2870
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Should we do fisty cuffs in Wildy

2871
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
and just start beating each other up

2872
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
until there's a crowned Reefling at the end?

2873
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,000
And then I give you a rose as a favour

2874
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,000
because you're the knight that stood against all Reeflings.

2875
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
And...

2876
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
And lutes are domain, like the way for you.

2877
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Oh, I was in the middle of a ceremony.

2878
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
But Romeo sent me.

2879
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
But I'm busy delivering in a ceremony to my congregation.

2880
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Ah, yes.

2881
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:46,000
It certainly seems like you have a captive audience.

2882
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Okay, okay, what do you want?

2883
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,000
So I can get rid of you and continue with my ceremony.

2884
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Romeo sent me?

2885
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
He says you've been able to help?

2886
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Ah, Romeo, yes.

2887
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,000
A fine land, but he's a wee bit confused.

2888
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Very confused.

2889
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Anyway, Romeo wishes to be married to Julia.

2890
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
She must be rescued from her father's control.

2891
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I agree, and I think I have an idea.

2892
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
A potion to make her dad...

2893
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Oh, to appear passed away.

2894
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Dead!

2895
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Sounds a bit creepy to me, but please continue.

2896
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,000
The potion will only make Julia yet appear dead.

2897
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Then she will be taken to the crypt.

2898
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Crypt!

2899
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Again, we're getting a bit creepy, mate.

2900
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
You must have some strange hobbies.

2901
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
That's what the berries someone gave me.

2902
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Apart from...

2903
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Did that refling want me to be asleep?

2904
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Or did you want to be asleep?

2905
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Okay, reflings!

2906
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Once you have...

2907
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Why does someone have a...

2908
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Someone has a prayer on?

2909
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Don't leave it on.

2910
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
You've got a prayer on.

2911
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
You're going to run out of prayer.

2912
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Also, someone get fond of the potion!

2913
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
That's terrible.

2914
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Guys, you're putting your prayer on.

2915
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
You're going to run out of prayer.

2916
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Literally, I only have nine prayer points.

2917
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Right, everyone outside the church.

2918
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Con-

2919
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Mass is over.

2920
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Congrats on finishing Mass.

2921
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
You just have a lot of fun.

2922
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Where are we going?

2923
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Oh, that's cool.

2924
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Oh, you can't see because of my hair.

2925
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
All right, you can kind of see it.

2926
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,000
See how the bar is like...

2927
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Oh, you're getting close to being finished.

2928
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
That's new.

2929
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I don't remember that.

2930
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Where are we heading?

2931
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Where are we heading?

2932
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Whoa!

2933
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Where am I?

2934
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
No?

2935
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Can I please go back to the surface?

2936
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Thank you.

2937
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Where do we need to go?

2938
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I'm looking...

2939
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Oh, there is...

2940
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Still in the same town.

2941
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Thank goodness.

2942
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Okay.

2943
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,000
I'll just follow the HUD for the most part.

2944
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Oh, you wished to trade with me.

2945
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I will accept your trade.

2946
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
What do you offer me?

2947
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
What do you offer me?

2948
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Oh!

2949
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
You've rejected!

2950
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
How dare you!

2951
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Oh, no.

2952
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I had to do with a friend.

2953
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Sorry.

2954
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I keep freaking adding people as a friend by accident.

2955
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Oh, wait.

2956
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Hold on.

2957
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I need to remove you.

2958
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I'm dying.

2959
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Delete.

2960
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Rip.

2961
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
One tick.

2962
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Player.

2963
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Flick.

2964
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:23,000
One tick flicking on Romeo and Juliet Quest.

2965
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
True gamers here, honestly.

2966
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I wish I understood the tick mechanic.

2967
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I've heard it explained so many times to me.

2968
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
I don't get it.

2969
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I don't get it.

2970
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I'm practicing.

2971
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Literally.

2972
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Oh, there's like little birds making noises in the game.

2973
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Is this the actual priestess...

2974
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Crickets, please.

2975
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,000
What?

2976
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:49,000
You want me to just play?

2977
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I'll just play crickets right now, even though you asked for it like five minutes ago.

2978
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Oh, it's this shop.

2979
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Okay.

2980
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,000
What are we doing over here?

2981
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I thought it was only in the day that I remember Scotland.

2982
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I'm like, I can be out until like 9.

2983
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
It's summer.

2984
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:14,000
When it's summer in Scotland, the sun doesn't go away until like 9.

2985
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
It's pretty bright.

2986
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Oh, no.

2987
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
I'm closing the door.

2988
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Okay.

2989
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,000
I thought I was closing the door, but I'm not.

2990
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Okay.

2991
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Let's talk.

2992
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I am apocrity.

2993
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I broke potions.

2994
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Do you need anything?

2995
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Yes.

2996
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I do need something very specific about Romeo and Juliet.

2997
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Wait.

2998
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Wasn't there a movie called Romeo and Juliet?

2999
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
And it was about nose.

3000
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,000
What do these berries look like?

3001
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Wait.

3002
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
We need berries.

3003
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Oh, no.

3004
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Someone gave me berries.

3005
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Okay.

3006
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I guess we will get the berries.

3007
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Um, to the Grand Exchange Reeflings, we will go obtain some berries.

3008
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Oh, I can't get out because someone closed the door.

3009
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
I clicked on the map to get out.

3010
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Someone's closing the door.

3011
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I can't get out of that room.

3012
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I'm not stuck in there.

3013
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Yeah.

3014
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
My hand hurts after a few minutes of it.

3015
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Oh, you can only last a few minutes now?

3016
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
One handed?

3017
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Right.

3018
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Let's go get some berries.

3019
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Secret berries.

3020
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I thought it said I didn't need anything.

3021
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
It said recommended items.

3022
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
None.

3023
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
It says bring.

3024
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
You can pick some from the bushes.

3025
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Oh, we're to pick them from the bushes.

3026
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I'm sorry.

3027
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,000
I apologize.

3028
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Where's the bushes?

3029
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Bring.

3030
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Talk.

3031
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
I've just read it.

3032
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Bring.

3033
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Nope.

3034
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I just read where I can pick the bushes.

3035
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
You can pick some bushes southeast of Iraq.

3036
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Wait.

3037
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Where am I supposed to go then?

3038
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
What's southeast?

3039
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Southeast?

3040
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Like over here?

3041
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Feels like I can get stabbed in these back alleys.

3042
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
You can pick my dingo, but...

3043
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Send!

3044
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
We're trying to find a freaking bush.

3045
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Yeah, done.

3046
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Yeah, done.

3047
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I didn't tell you my short caller arrived for our streaming app.

3048
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Where are the berries?

3049
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Pass the dark wizard.

3050
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Okay.

3051
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Strong reeflings, please go ahead and beat the absolute crap out of those dark wizards.

3052
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
For weaker reeflings, get ready.

3053
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Prepare thyself.

3054
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Where are these berries?

3055
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
I'm looking.

3056
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Oh my god, the reeflings are just absolutely going to town on them.

3057
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
All the magic noises.

3058
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Oh!

3059
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Yes!

3060
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
The bushes are ahead.

3061
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Fragile and weak, please handle me with care.

3062
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Trying to find strongies bushes then.

3063
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Right.

3064
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I'm going to say something.

3065
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I'm going to say something controversial.

3066
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I was going to make a here ASMR, like here sounds, but it was rather, rather different.

3067
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Okay.

3068
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Right.

3069
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
I've got berries.

3070
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Everyone, everyone collect your berries off the bushes.

3071
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Has everyone got a berry?

3072
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:05,000
It looks like they're infinite spawn bushes actually, so.

3073
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Wait, did bots run these berries?

3074
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Wait, it's cost 400 GP for these berries?

3075
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Have we just stumbled on a money maker?

3076
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Here ASMR, not controversial.

3077
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,000
How would that even work?

3078
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:25,000
I would place the microphone at hips level.

3079
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:28,000
I've been here for two seconds and you're already getting controversial.

3080
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I can't.

3081
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,000
You show up in it.

3082
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Right.

3083
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I think everyone's got it.

3084
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Yeah.

3085
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,000
These berries are bought and free to play world smothers with your hair.

3086
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Next winning strat in GG.

3087
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Okay.

3088
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Let's go past the wizards again.

3089
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Stronger leaflings.

3090
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,000
You know the drill.

3091
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Has everyone got a berry?

3092
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:47,000
400 GP.

3093
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Oh my God.

3094
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
That's huge.

3095
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Interest on the 10 million GP.

3096
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
True.

3097
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
True.

3098
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
10 million GP investment.

3099
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Beat them up.

3100
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Beat them up.

3101
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Show them who's boss.

3102
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Oh, that red bead is worth so much money.

3103
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Oh, that refling got it.

3104
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Oh, no.

3105
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Take this bead.

3106
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
I got it.

3107
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I got it.

3108
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Wow.

3109
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Wizard hats are 1,000 money.

3110
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Why is it so much money?

3111
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
We should be killing these wizards over and over again.

3112
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Okay.

3113
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
I'm going to get out of here before we're getting trouble.

3114
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I don't want the wizards to spawn and start getting us.

3115
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Stronger leaf, we're doing this one.

3116
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Can we have a reward that lets us see the stream stingers?

3117
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Stop.

3118
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I've literally not even put them on.

3119
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I just realized I've not even shown you what my stream stingers look like.

3120
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:42,000
That's terrible.

3121
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,000
That's terrible.

3122
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Literally like, what did reflings look like?

3123
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
And I'm like, what do you mean?

3124
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I've already shown you what reflings look like in the artwork.

3125
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
We've got stingers either.

3126
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
And I don't even use my loading screen.

3127
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,000
And I spent like 600 US dollars on it.

3128
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
I'm like, genuinely such a bad vtuber.

3129
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,000
But I just want to jump in the game.

3130
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Who did that?

3131
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Who did that?

3132
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Who did that?

3133
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I managed to somehow get past.

3134
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Alright, Romeo and Juliet.

3135
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Well done.

3136
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,000
You have the berries.

3137
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I do.

3138
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Okay.

3139
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Oh, he's apocratizing.

3140
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,000
He's apocratizing all over the place.

3141
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
I'm going to smack the plan.

3142
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Bring the potion to Juliet.

3143
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Okay.

3144
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
I'm going to stand outside and wait for everyone to get out.

3145
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Because you already know what's going to happen.

3146
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
And you're always going to freaking smack everyone's face.

3147
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Strongest seat is a moneymaker.

3148
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Who said that?

3149
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Oh.

3150
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Okay, wait until the other reflings are ready.

3151
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I'm mousin' all over the refling.

3152
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I'm mousin' all over you.

3153
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Are you like that?

3154
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Oh, I got that.

3155
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Mousin' all over me.

3156
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
I'm just mousin' all over you.

3157
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Watch out for Viralt Guards.

3158
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
No, Virat.

3159
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Doubt these potions are illegal.

3160
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
I haven't made any money though.

3161
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Drink the potion for a funny thing.

3162
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Oh, I don't want to drink it.

3163
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:02,000
I'd have to go get another thing again.

3164
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Does it make you pass out?

3165
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Viralt Guards don't get paid enough to care about that.

3166
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Honestly, $1 million donation reward.

3167
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Use stream startin' screen once for 10 seconds.

3168
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Bravo, honestly.

3169
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,000
It's been $600, $800-ish.

3170
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Okay, is that one more refling?

3171
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Oh, we're all level six now or something?

3172
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Whoa, that's a lot of refling.

3173
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Well, no, refling.

3174
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Or are you not done the quest properly?

3175
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Or is this...

3176
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
You've got a chef's hat on, which makes me think you're a refler.

3177
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
What are the odds that someone just happens to be doing the quest at the same time?

3178
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
When are we going to winter town?

3179
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:51,000
I've literally never done any event in RuneScape

3180
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,000
because I'm just so bad at it and I don't understand.

3181
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
I know that because I had to hunt it down

3182
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,000
to get a refler shop for the fan art.

3183
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Oh, watch it mostly shine.

3184
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I didn't even know stingers were a thing.

3185
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
So everyone got a logo stinger

3186
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
and everyone got an artwork stinger.

3187
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I need a moment of time.

3188
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Oh, someone wants to trade.

3189
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Except your trade.

3190
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,000
What do you offer me?

3191
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Ah!

3192
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Okay.

3193
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
I'll accept.

3194
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
I did say I wanted your ink, okay?

3195
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I got you.

3196
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Yeah.

3197
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Right, we're going to hand over the potion to Julia.

3198
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Winter tot is where the yarrow...

3199
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Literally, that's why I'm like winter fell in Skyrim.

3200
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,000
That's where the yarrow live.

3201
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Right, we're going to open the door for everyone.

3202
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Yarrow ballroom.

3203
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,000
These here.

3204
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Oh, I'm going to close the door back.

3205
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Okay, let's get inside the house, please.

3206
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Get inside the house.

3207
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Get up the stairs.

3208
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Anyway, if I catch any refling closing doors...

3209
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Something bad's going to happen.

3210
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I don't know.

3211
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
I'm not decided on the punishment yet.

3212
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Your stream starting soon is very beautiful.

3213
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Yes, but it's very...

3214
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
As well.

3215
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Oh, sorry.

3216
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I have a Kandava potion here.

3217
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Suggested by Father Lawrence, if you...

3218
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Oh, wait, that's me.

3219
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Excuse me, sorry, I don't know where that voice came from.

3220
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Have a Kandava potion here. Suggested by Father Lawrence.

3221
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:20,000
If you drink it, it will make you appear dead.

3222
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Yes?

3223
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
And when you appear dead,

3224
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:28,000
you're still in lifeless corpse will be removed from the crypt.

3225
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Oh, a cold, dark, creepy crypt.

3226
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Sounds just peachy.

3227
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Then Romeo can steal...

3228
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
And...

3229
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Let's just steal into the crypt and rescue you just as you wake up.

3230
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:48,000
And this is a great idea for getting me out of here.

3231
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
To be fair, I can't take all the credit.

3232
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
In fact, it was all Father Lawrence's suggestion.

3233
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Okay, if this is the best we can do, then hand over that potion.

3234
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
You pass the suspicion potion to Juliet.

3235
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Wonderful.

3236
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Wonderful, I just thought Romeo could remember to get me from the crypt.

3237
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Why do I feel like we're about to bust her out of the crypt?

3238
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Please go to Romeo and make sure you understand the lie of his...

3239
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:17,000
His gormless, love-lorn, soppy ways.

3240
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
He can be a bit dense sometimes and I don't want to wake...

3241
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
And I want to wake up in the crypt on my own.

3242
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Yeah, we're definitely picking up the crypt.

3243
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Here it is.

3244
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Oh, he...

3245
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Here's Philippine, my cousin, she's in...

3246
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
She's in on the plot too.

3247
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
She's going to make it seem like it's more convincing.

3248
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Yes, I'm quick.

3249
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Ah.

3250
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
What's a British boy?

3251
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,000
He's quick, British, quick.

3252
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Nick-a-car.

3253
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Yes, I'm quite an actress.

3254
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Good luck, dear cousin.

3255
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Right, bottoms up.

3256
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Oh, she's Paris.

3257
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Oh, no.

3258
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Juliet has died.

3259
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:59,000
You may be more believable if you're not smiling when you see it.

3260
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Oh, yeah.

3261
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
You might be right.

3262
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Oh, no, no, no.

3263
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Let's try that again.

3264
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Try that again.

3265
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Oh, no.

3266
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Juliet's dead.

3267
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I can't do, like, three different accents at one time.

3268
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Perhaps a bit louder, like, you're upset, you know, that your cousin just died.

3269
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Right, yeah, okay.

3270
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Nick-a-car.

3271
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Okay, I think I'm getting the motivation now.

3272
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Okay, let's just try this again.

3273
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Oh, no.

3274
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Juliet's dead.

3275
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Oh, no.

3276
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Oh, no.

3277
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Juliet, my poor dead cousin.

3278
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Oh, this was not a lot of screaming.

3279
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Oh, you cunt, she's dead.

3280
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Oh, poor Juliet.

3281
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I made preparations for her body to be blessed with the crypt.

3282
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
This is terrible.

3283
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I don't know where that came from.

3284
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Right, okay.

3285
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Where do we go next?

3286
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Bring...

3287
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Talk to Romeo and Varric Square to finish the quest.

3288
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,000
All right.

3289
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,000
That man was Cornel Sanders.

3290
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:58,000
How am I getting door blocked?

3291
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:01,000
How have they not figured out this freaking door block, honestly?

3292
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Stop!

3293
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Right, I just went through that door.

3294
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
That's how strong I am.

3295
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
I just went through that door.

3296
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Okay.

3297
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Let's go to Romeo.

3298
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Where everyone...

3299
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Right, I'll wait outside.

3300
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Father noticed that a random person handed her a potion and she perished, literally.

3301
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Oh, no.

3302
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Juliet.

3303
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
You're dead.

3304
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,000
No.

3305
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I say no.

3306
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Follow the cute face.

3307
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Any cute fishers?

3308
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Any cute fishermen coming to hook her?

3309
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Yee.

3310
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Quite the hooker.

3311
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Hey.

3312
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Yeah.

3313
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Oh.

3314
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Yo-ho.

3315
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I assume everyone got out.

3316
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Yeah, the door's been left open.

3317
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:48,000
That's how I know all the reeflings are available.

3318
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Oh, there's two doors to this place.

3319
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Okay, we'll go in this room.

3320
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Oh, I now understand people are in their angular gear.

3321
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
I saw that.

3322
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Who's that shadowed guy?

3323
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I saw that.

3324
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:06,000
You literally are making us walk all the way around because you closed that fecking door.

3325
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,000
I saw that.

3326
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I literally saw that in 4K.

3327
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
It's you.

3328
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,000
It's the freaking shadow one.

3329
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Who's your name?

3330
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Identify yourself.

3331
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Bye.

3332
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:23,000
More like slamming to a door.

3333
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Romeo, it's all set.

3334
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Juliet has dropped the potion.

3335
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Ah, great.

3336
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,000
The potion.

3337
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Great.

3338
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,000
What potion would that be then?

3339
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,000
The kind of a potion.

3340
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
You know, the one which will make her appear dead.

3341
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
She's in the crepe.

3342
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Pop along and clean your true love.

3343
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:36,000
But I'm scared.

3344
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Will you come with me?

3345
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Yeah, I knew we were going to come with you.

3346
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Oh, come on.

3347
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:44,000
I just saw the entrance when I visited there last.

3348
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Stranny, you have hooked me.

3349
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:49,000
What voice did I give him?

3350
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Oh, this is pretty scary.

3351
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
I would be quiet.

3352
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Oh, he's got flowers.

3353
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Oh my god, cut scene.

3354
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Look, we're here.

3355
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Look, Juliet's over there.

3356
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Oh, there she is.

3357
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
I don't remember doing this quest, honestly.

3358
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:09,000
I think I'll confuse it with Goblin Mail one.

3359
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Go over to her and I'll go wait over here.

3360
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Okay, then.

3361
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Yeah, just go.

3362
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:23,000
She's fine.

3363
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Hey, Juliet.

3364
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Juliet.

3365
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Oh, dear.

3366
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:31,000
You seem to be dead.

3367
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
What voice did I give her?

3368
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Oh, Romeo.

3369
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I'm Philippa.

3370
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Oh, wow.

3371
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
You're a fox.

3372
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:44,000
It's a shame about Juliet, but perhaps we can meet up later.

3373
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Who's Juliet?

3374
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Wait, what?

3375
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
That's it?

3376
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
What?

3377
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:56,000
What?

3378
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Hello?

3379
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I didn't wait, so she's actually dead.

3380
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Did we actually kill her?

3381
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Oh, no.

3382
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
That's really sad.

3383
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I actually feel really bad.

3384
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
I don't remember that.

3385
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Father Lawrence messed it all up.

3386
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
We just poisoned an innocent woman.

3387
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Wait, we're go check.

3388
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Wait, we'll go to her house to see if she's there because what?

3389
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,000
That was a method.

3390
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Right, we're going back to the house because what?

3391
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Juliet in shambles, literally.

3392
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:36,000
She's selling her stonks.

3393
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
That was crazy.

3394
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Right, the door's still open.

3395
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Surely.

3396
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Surely there will be no shenanigans at this door.

3397
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
She's fine.

3398
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Is she actually?

3399
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Let's get inside.

3400
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Let's inside.

3401
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Inside.

3402
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
There we go.

3403
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,000
You got there in the end.

3404
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
You just need a little guidance.

3405
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:06,000
I suppose you're quite pleased with yourself now.

3406
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Wait, why?

3407
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Juliet?

3408
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:16,000
She's literally getting ran through about yourself.

3409
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,000
What did she say?

3410
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:21,000
I sat in that cold crib for ages waiting on Romeo.

3411
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
That useless fool never showed up.

3412
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
And all I got was indigestion.

3413
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,000
I'm done with men like him.

3414
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Now go away before I call my father.

3415
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Oh, can I play piano?

3416
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Oh, I wish you could play piano.

3417
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
That'd be kind of cool though.

3418
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:36,000
That's so bad.

3419
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Wait, why can't I go through that door?

3420
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
That's actually really sad.

3421
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:42,000
I feel kind of bad though.

3422
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Sorry, Juliet.

3423
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
We didn't mean that.

3424
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,000
I'm sorry.

3425
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Stop!

3426
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
I'm getting locked in again.

3427
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Actually getting soft locked in my video game.

3428
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Okay, I am going to make a cup of tea and call a pee break.

3429
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
And then we're...

3430
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Are we got enough level, like enough skill level now that anyone can like trade?

3431
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Is nine quest points enough?

3432
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I think we were going to do some quick fissure.

3433
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Fissure on.

3434
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Pee break, finally.

3435
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Let's just name a preview.

3436
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
All of yous have been needing a pee for ages.

3437
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,000
A wee break.

3438
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,000
A piddle break, if you will.

3439
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Oh my god.

3440
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Yeah, what do you want to give me?

3441
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Oh, a beer and a kebab.

3442
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Are you asking for a drunk stream soon?

3443
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Because don't think I won't do that.

3444
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Don't think I won't give the people what they want.

3445
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Thank you very much.

3446
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Okay.

3447
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Oh wait, is that going to log me out and then you can all see what my freaking email is?

3448
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I will turn...

3449
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:44,000
I will hide the game off a screen.

3450
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
But I might have to log back in again.

3451
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
No, let's game audio.

3452
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Hold on.

3453
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Game chat, donations.

3454
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,000
In game?

3455
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
No.

3456
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Right.

3457
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,000
I'm going to do that just in case because I don't know if it's going to show.

3458
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
You can set it to 25 minutes.

3459
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Oh, I've not set it.

3460
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Okay.

3461
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Give me like three minutes.

3462
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
I'm going to pee.

3463
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I'm going to make a cup of tea.

3464
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I do recommend you get up, stretch your legs, get some water and then we are going to do

3465
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
actual cooking.

3466
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
We're going to do actual cooking now, I think.

3467
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Because we've hit the quest point thing.

3468
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,000
I don't know.

3469
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
But okay.

3470
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Give me...

3471
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Let me cook for like three minutes and by cook, I mean let me boil a freaking a kettle.

3472
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Okay.

3473
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Right.

3474
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
I will be a moment.

3475
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Okay.

3476
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Three minutes.

3477
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Go for a go for a tinkle-winkle.

3478
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Okay.

3479
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Okay.

3480
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Okay.

3481
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Okay.

3482

3572
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:34,840
about fishing is that it all expires so you have to move to the next tail this is to prevent

dropping is faster I threw them on the ground I want the xp for fishing as well

3629
03:00:58,280 --> 03:01:03,720
so I say that as if it's not like 10 xp for a net honestly

3630
03:01:05,640 --> 03:01:13,560
it's strong a slang term too oh I'm strong in myself right now honestly I think it works

3631
03:01:14,520 --> 03:01:21,080
any stronger my inventory is fully f I'm literally missing one fish like please just

3632
03:01:21,080 --> 03:01:28,680
fish it up oh my gosh finally you can't carry any more fish just click the raw anchovies or fishies

3633
03:01:28,680 --> 03:01:34,680
and then let's see how many we burn we burnt the first one cook the same burnt the next

03:01:37,400 --> 03:01:42,120
yeah inventory full begin walking sequence find nearest fire honestly

3635
03:01:42,760 --> 03:01:51,400

3636
03:01:51,400 --> 03:01:56,440
you not get fired for that like please don't get fired because you're watching a RuneScape stream

3637

3638
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:09,560

3639
03:02:09,560 --> 03:02:16,120

3640
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:21,240
I hope no wait oh no the fire disappeared sorry I wasn't cooking that entire time sorry I wasn't

3641
03:02:21,240 --> 03:02:26,360
paying attention look I just get so distracted there's some of your feelings around how am I

I've got food in my tum tum I've got a honey tea that can't wait getting a promotion from

3647
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:57,960
each of our boss calls in on the office you're all she is based technically you're also playing

3648
03:02:57,960 --> 03:03:03,320
runescape at work off I wouldn't he say streamings work honestly I'd say the only time it feels

3649
03:03:03,320 --> 03:03:09,080
like work is if I have to prepare like maybe like for the game shows and stuff level nine by the way

3650
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:15,160
that's right read him and wait for level nine boss calls you in the office and says he's watching

3651
03:03:15,160 --> 03:03:24,040
scrawny too runescape takes no focus though okay and now I am going to hold shift and drop all

3660
03:04:27,400 --> 03:04:33,480
I hate that's just how it is right oh there we go got it right and then we go back to fishing

3661
03:04:33,480 --> 03:04:42,520
because we're only level 99 I'm gonna check the chart view cooking gates we can do meat chicken

3662
03:04:42,520 --> 03:04:48,440
and all that trout is 15 which is a big start upgrade so I guess we're doing this until 15

3663
03:04:49,080 --> 03:04:53,800
and we're going fishing elsewhere but as we level up we get closer and closer

3664
03:04:55,560 --> 03:04:59,400
oh my god level four fishing not to brag or anything but level four all of us

3665
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:06,680
I'm pretty close level fishing

3666
03:05:10,280 --> 03:05:14,920
wait what are you doing a command he's tapping a command well got run you catch the shrimp and

3667
03:05:14,920 --> 03:05:22,280
burn them I'll burn them thanks for hanging see when you come back I just I don't know I've not

3668
03:05:22,280 --> 03:05:27,400
decided if it's an endurance right now we're just memeing and dreaming and streaming and fishing

3669
03:05:28,280 --> 03:05:31,080
and then we're fishing and we're cooking and we're cooking and we're fishing

3670
03:05:33,480 --> 03:05:39,080
my mind not working you just gotta trust me for real for real don't worry I do this all the time

3671
03:05:39,960 --> 03:05:49,640
don't worry did you see it what what did I see the toenail wait what did I miss was there

3672
03:05:49,640 --> 03:05:56,440
something on stream I don't see it I see you guys we're all just hanging out

3673
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:10,600
sorry I've got gains to get bye bye I don't think I was a roofland I was

3674
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:15,000
someone that was interested in what we're doing see how you feel like four is going from there

3675
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:19,400
she literally at the start was no this will not be an endurance human after a few hours she

3676
03:06:19,400 --> 03:06:25,800
doesn't know anymore it's hard just the bots hanging out doing a lot of bot things he wants to

3677
03:06:25,800 --> 03:06:32,040
talk about his cars extended warranty I literally I do not want to talk to you leave me alone old

3678
03:06:32,040 --> 03:06:39,480
man he's getting harassed by an NPC shadow wizard and when you get how how purple are those anchovies

3679
03:06:40,520 --> 03:06:44,600
are shrimpies oh wait anchovies and shrimp are different

3680
03:06:45,240 --> 03:06:53,080
hmm just tip some money for another four hours I'm like a receipt a reciprocal

3681
03:06:53,800 --> 03:06:58,120
a reciprocal Danny you put Danny put text behind my screen

3682
03:07:00,600 --> 03:07:02,680
okay there text doesn't go over me anymore

3683
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:11,480
oh my god leveling up we're getting them gains I did not realize how slow fishing was to get

3684
03:07:11,960 --> 03:07:12,680
my goodness

3685
03:07:16,920 --> 03:07:24,360
she doesn't want to leave us honestly I like after the so I can apply for monetization I'm

3686
03:07:24,360 --> 03:07:28,760
going to apply after the stream and see what happens I don't know how long it's going to take

3687
03:07:30,760 --> 03:07:38,120
but um tomorrow's ASMR so that's short and then the taste test and stream is short as well

3688
03:07:38,760 --> 03:07:44,600
however it might work out better because if I get monetized then I'm doing my pop-up

3689
03:07:44,600 --> 03:07:50,760
monetization stream surprise thing um I know I'm fishing but there's no fishy

3690
03:07:52,360 --> 03:07:56,360
I wish you good luck on the month yeah basically YouTube just reviews the account and goes yeah

3691
03:07:56,360 --> 03:08:00,600
good to go oh man my bank is locked can you hit me up again in three days

3692
03:08:00,840 --> 03:08:16,520
I don't know what that means back to fishing we're just fishing uh but yes um we're just

3693
03:08:16,520 --> 03:08:24,120
going to level up as much as we can do right now um any ringfoot adventure streams yeah

3694
03:08:25,080 --> 03:08:30,120
100% I absolutely adore love ring uh ringfoot adventure

3695
03:08:31,560 --> 03:08:37,880
and it was really fun as long as it's not dangerous for my car but I'm pretty sure I got

3696
03:08:37,880 --> 03:08:43,560
pretty high last time do you have an idea of how many more watch hours you need oh I made

3697
03:08:43,560 --> 03:08:49,880
watchers the problem was YouTube wasn't updating our stats for one week like the stats are now

3698
03:08:49,880 --> 03:08:58,680
behind one week like it doesn't make sense um so only now I can apply even though after debut

3699
03:08:59,240 --> 03:09:06,360
we had watch time like it's just a bit it's a bit silly but um we're submitting we also think now

3700
03:09:06,360 --> 03:09:13,480
that we have one confirmed like week of stats the culling stops here so you might be unsubscribed

3701
03:09:13,480 --> 03:09:17,800
if you're watching in right now I don't know but don't be afraid to like and subscribe to the stream

3702
03:09:17,880 --> 03:09:26,200
helps out you know that jazz but um we think the culling has stopped so a few ASMR group collabs

3703
03:09:26,200 --> 03:09:33,960
and all that are gonna come out shortly after monetization because the girls some dummy used

3704
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:39,720
my email to make an account and one of the passwords I use that's just like as great

3705
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:45,320
names ring fit my blood please don't push yourself too hard like that one time I don't I just really

3706
03:09:45,320 --> 03:09:53,000
enjoyed it but I can't do like subscribe and send your bank card details hell yeah um just thumbs

3707
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:59,560
up right now thank you I don't know why but haven't been subbed on once um maybe it's because I got

3708
03:09:59,560 --> 03:10:05,640
YouTube premium I don't know what caused it because I did get marshmallows that are like no I like

3709
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:10,600
I straight up gotten subbed by like three of the girls or did this or whatever I don't know if it's

3710
03:10:10,600 --> 03:10:15,560
also related to if you don't watch the girls like shorts or if you don't watch any content but

3711
03:10:15,560 --> 03:10:21,480
subscribe and then peace out then YouTube don't like that and see it as bot activity rather than

3712
03:10:21,480 --> 03:10:25,720
someone subscribing and being like I'll come back later and watch this like not everyone watches YouTube

3713
03:10:25,720 --> 03:10:33,080
shorts um which reminds me I should have sent two shorts to Emmy to review because the editor had

3714
03:10:33,080 --> 03:10:40,520
finished those shorts I'm going to do that after stream and solve by watching everyone

3715
03:10:40,520 --> 03:10:45,800
literally if you put if you watch their shorts or puts like some minutes and a watch time into them

3716
03:10:45,800 --> 03:10:52,920
then I think YouTube doesn't um take you I got unsubbed from some other VTubers pre-davio but

3717
03:10:52,920 --> 03:10:58,520
not from any of the girls good good that's what I like to hear so me subscribing just to support

3718
03:10:58,520 --> 03:11:05,880
is pointless oh no like actual YouTube subscribe is not pointless what happened was the accounts

3719
03:11:05,880 --> 03:11:11,880
were getting called because they were new and for bot protection we were getting wrecked but we

3720
03:11:11,880 --> 03:11:18,120
think now because there's one week of confirmed stats it's over like I don't think we got called

3721
03:11:18,120 --> 03:11:27,640
at all recently like today or when I was asleep so yeah so I think it's only going up from here

3722
03:11:27,640 --> 03:11:32,920
now thankfully I like check the stats of everyone's accounts and we should have been at 5k right now

3723
03:11:32,920 --> 03:11:41,400
but it's okay we'll we'll work back up towards it um yes it's weird I know it's bot protection

3724
03:11:41,960 --> 03:11:49,400
I had never experienced it before and me oh my it was aggressive on us very aggressive but I do

3725
03:11:49,400 --> 03:11:53,800
think it's I genuinely do believe it's over especially once the girls get monetized I don't

3726
03:11:53,880 --> 03:11:59,080
think you experience it as a monetized channel because that just seems a bit odd because they

3727
03:11:59,080 --> 03:12:04,840
know if you're being watched by bots or not so oh my god my mind's are cracking okay I'm gonna

3728
03:12:04,840 --> 03:12:11,560
slip my slip I'm gonna sip my tea please don't do anything to the slit okay

3729
03:12:19,480 --> 03:12:20,040
delicious

3730
03:12:23,880 --> 03:12:26,600
but yes I have a very fun collapse coming out soon TM

3731
03:12:26,600 --> 03:12:39,960
I can't wait YouTube stopped in oh literally it's such a shame I felt so bad for the girls

3732
03:12:39,960 --> 03:12:44,840
because we were like in the discord like oh my god we're at 3000 subscribers oh my god oh my god

3733
03:12:44,840 --> 03:12:51,800
like getting ready to make but like all of us held back from doing a celebration post because it

3734
03:12:51,800 --> 03:13:00,760
just wasn't happening and it was such a shame I do have a special like congrats on 5k for everyone

3735
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:05,560
posting a 10k and then I don't know what's happening after that if I should order more artwork or not

3736
03:13:06,680 --> 03:13:11,320
the 10k artwork is absolutely gorgeous so I can't wait for everyone to react to it

3737
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:16,280
but I can't I can't let anyone know what it is I don't want to ruin the surprise

3738
03:13:16,280 --> 03:13:22,520
level 10 cooking we did it we did it are you squidding me right now

3739

3741
03:13:39,080 --> 03:13:47,640
how do you mean the onion my fishy my fire keeps the fires pranking me it keeps disappearing as

3742
03:13:47,640 --> 03:13:55,480
soon as I go get it I'm on level 11 it stops you cooking every every time it's selling oh I'm in

3743
03:13:55,480 --> 03:14:03,160
the fire now I'm sacrificing myself for nothing interesting happens use it on the fire I think

3744
03:14:03,160 --> 03:14:09,880

3747
03:14:29,400 --> 03:14:31,880
okay who's making that noise

3748
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:37,880
sounds like someone's building something building something

3749
03:14:40,520 --> 03:14:48,360
back to the fishing we're getting oh pardon me sorry maybe we should be doing the cows you know

3750
03:14:48,360 --> 03:14:55,800
that so we can get um uh how to say it so we can get combat and maybe we can do a few more quests

3751
03:14:55,800 --> 03:15:01,640
that require a tiny bit of combat before so we don't get too wrecked is there a timetable for

3752
03:15:01,640 --> 03:15:08,280
super membership or is it still soon it's still soon um basically it's gonna pop up once it happens

3951
03:38:20,920 --> 03:38:28,200
bag of fun aim I have no idea how long we're streaming for today jokes about stroney usually

3952

3959
03:39:15,160 --> 03:39:22,440
fish um to cook so once I stop burning fish I'm gonna like use them and I think that's gonna

3960
03:39:22,440 --> 03:39:27,000
propel me quite a lot I want to do it all live on stream and like it's not gonna be behind a

3984
03:42:00,120 --> 03:42:10,600
there hopefully the fishing gets a bit faster because seriously this is like taken forever at

3985
03:42:10,600 --> 03:42:13,960
this fishing berth

3986
03:42:18,760 --> 03:42:20,760
juke pet is closest to a slug

3996
03:43:31,720 --> 03:43:39,960
pick up the fish that's on the floor my only worry is that it might be quiet and we might have to

03:43:39,960 --> 03:43:48,360
swap to a different server who owns this hill we don't know we're ten and we're ten aunts okay

4034
03:48:08,360 --> 03:48:15,400
natural uh predator in uh the united kingdom but then once they were eradicated basically

4035
03:48:16,360 --> 03:48:19,800

place which is barbarian village I don't know if there's gonna be bot spam in there I could have

4141
04:00:06,840 --> 04:00:13,080
sworn I came across a religion bot before that was spamming and it and I was like there is no way

4142
04:00:13,080 --> 04:00:20,840
someone's paying for that it was the most bizarre thing this place has got to smell terrifying

4143
04:00:20,840 --> 04:00:27,800
literally rotten fish on the floor everywhere burnt fish cooked fish like the whole of gellinore

4144
04:00:27,800 --> 04:00:30,440

4147
04:00:58,760 --> 04:01:00,040
oh

4148
04:01:02,360 --> 04:01:05,640
they did not have to go so hard on the music in this game but so good

4149
04:01:09,560 --> 04:01:12,520
oh my god we're getting flexed on someone's got a fishing rod

4150
04:01:15,480 --> 04:01:21,000
actually getting flexed on hold on is that how you pick up anchovies by the fishing rod

4151
04:01:27,880 --> 04:01:30,600
well it means gonna force chat to get her done

4152
04:01:32,440 --> 04:01:38,680
there's only all I'm gonna say is there's only one way to finish that game there's only one real

4153
04:01:38,680 --> 04:01:43,720
way to finish that game you should work in the seafood business

4154
04:01:45,640 --> 04:01:49,880
imagine getting followed by Jehovah's Witnesses even in old-school runes game honestly

4155
04:01:50,840 --> 04:01:57,080
there's boss like and it's like why you get more exp for cooking rather than yeah

4156
04:01:58,120 --> 04:02:02,200
there's only one real ending to that game and I will accept no other

4157
04:02:07,320 --> 04:02:13,400
any food by strongy seafood if I see it I eat it oh that's good I like that

4159
04:02:21,560 --> 04:02:28,360
honestly I think I can't remember if I said this or not I thought they're just shouting out like

4160
04:02:28,360 --> 04:02:33,400
randomly I would just shout like the most common like boy names and like a chance for someone to

4161
04:02:33,400 --> 04:02:37,960
hear their name just like jack and then just freak you out and then we just go back to the

4162
04:02:37,960 --> 04:02:43,480
gameplay and I played nothing happened what's another popular boy name I have no idea

4163
04:02:43,480 --> 04:02:47,960
Jacob so there we go okay and then we just go back to gameplay I played nothing

4164
04:02:49,880 --> 04:02:53,480

4171
04:03:42,120 --> 04:03:47,720

4172
04:03:47,720 --> 04:03:52,440
after like 30 minutes type thing I don't want anyone panicking thinking they're they're gonna

4173
04:03:52,440 --> 04:03:56,520
like pair them up forget their name if you say Brian three times in front of a mirror you can

4174
04:03:56,520 --> 04:04:06,840
summon him and he tells us a pun 19 oh we're so close we're so close maybe like one more rack of

4175
04:04:06,840 --> 04:04:13,080
fish and then we're done if I don't burn any actually they're really starting not to get burnt

4176
04:04:13,080 --> 04:04:17,640
I'm really happy with that oh that's someone cutting down a tree that's what that noise is

4177
04:04:19,000 --> 04:04:23,320
ripped to all those with this obscure yeah like that's the only reason I was like oh it's probably

4178
04:04:23,320 --> 04:04:29,720
not that fun for those who have like obscure name type thing going on no strongy make it so it

4179
04:04:29,720 --> 04:04:37,080
never wears up no I have to make aware all I'm not really into perma effect hypnosis it's just not

4223
04:09:46,440 --> 04:09:54,040
oh I am like two fishies away from 20 and then we're gonna move to barbarian village which

4224
04:09:54,040 --> 04:10:01,160
is west of the grand exchange um strongy has power to actually do eh crusted chef's hat weird flex

4225
04:10:02,120 --> 04:10:08,920
that happened to me in final fantasy our marshmallow is anonymous yes um if you have firefox it

4226
04:10:08,920 --> 04:10:14,200
might be able to translate the screen automatically sometimes a thousand why

4227
04:10:15,640 --> 04:10:23,480
um I am going to make another cup of tea hop on stride is a yo

4228
04:10:26,840 --> 04:10:32,040
um I'm gonna make another cup of tea because my voice is absolutely feeling it what do you

4229
04:10:32,040 --> 04:10:38,440
mean doing multiple 12 or streams back to back is straining on the throat oh it says 10 is that

4230
04:10:38,440 --> 04:10:45,160
like a runescape like congrats 10 balloon I saw that wait hold on let me make it look oh my god

4231
04:10:45,160 --> 04:10:51,080
he's getting performance anxiety making that fire look it's a 10 he must have got it for 10 oh you

4232
04:10:51,080 --> 04:10:59,000
don't look at your shirt what is it's like the logo let me zoom out a little bit it was the 10th

4233
04:10:59,000 --> 04:11:10,840
anniversary how old is this game there's too many people well another cup of tea you mean a cup

4234
04:11:11,640 --> 04:11:17,640
of tea for the non endurance stream right yeah surely as I say hold on the four hour mark and

4235
04:11:17,640 --> 04:11:21,960
we're not even like level 20 and cooking yeah not an endurance stream at all

4236
04:11:21,960 --> 04:11:29,640
oh google chrome apparently translates marshmallow as well but now if I send the marshmallow you'll

4237
04:11:29,640 --> 04:11:37,000
know it's me no actually because I'm not opening them up right now and for some reason marshmallow

4238
04:11:37,000 --> 04:11:42,840
puts like five questions from like loads of different times together at once it doesn't make

4239
04:11:42,840 --> 04:11:52,280
any sense send the most horrendous cringe marshmallow and sign your name at the bottom

4240
04:11:52,280 --> 04:11:58,760
like a gigatab I played when I was five on my older brother's account oh did he like force you

4241
04:11:58,760 --> 04:12:10,600
to go questing that's funniest anything this isn't runescape huh it's old school runescape

4242
04:12:11,560 --> 04:12:13,880
oh no we're getting corrections

4243
04:12:15,880 --> 04:12:25,720
oh wow doing bot run on your brother's account for him oh I said Lamalle twice in the same

4244
04:12:25,720 --> 04:12:33,720
sense oh my god cringe so cringe give it here you're in a level 14 fishing I mean we're getting

4245
04:12:33,720 --> 04:12:41,160
somewhere oh no I think I might need pee pee bye bye time as well actually yeah a tea and a pee

4246
04:12:41,160 --> 04:12:46,600
might but not a tea not the pee in the pee but I need a pee in the pee in general

4247
04:12:51,880 --> 04:12:58,280
key quest is how often are these old school rooms I was gonna do a few endurance streams I have no

4248
04:12:58,280 --> 04:13:04,840
idea how long cooking takes so I was gonna do a few endurance streams of it I was gonna try and

4249
04:13:04,840 --> 04:13:11,720
finish it in one month but I don't know if that's just being like far too crazy cut off fish wrapper

4250
04:13:11,720 --> 04:13:25,160
needs the tea and a pee on runescape with the refunds doing nothing hunting for shrimp I can't

4251
04:13:25,240 --> 04:13:28,760
rhyme can't do it I don't know how people do it at the same time

4252
04:13:30,760 --> 04:13:35,160
you can reasonably get night night cooking less than 30 hours okay I know currently we're not

4253
04:13:35,160 --> 04:13:48,520
maxing but it'll do it'll do I'm gonna do that we did it 30 hours of one tick clicking

4254
04:13:49,240 --> 04:13:56,360
level 20 cooking do we still burn shrimp on 20 with carab

4255
04:13:57,240 --> 04:14:04,360
one this carab one's a real thing it might be in print oh I don't think you burn after level 20

4256
04:14:07,320 --> 04:14:12,920
a reefling check for those of you who are on a fresh account what level are we looking at 20 as well

4257
04:14:13,560 --> 04:14:21,320
you guys 20 carambuas or oh she sees okay you're done

4258
04:14:24,520 --> 04:14:29,800
I've got 21 I've got 23 how are you all faster than me okay we'll go a little reefling

4259
04:14:31,240 --> 04:14:39,720
okay what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a pee and a tea a classic um and we will be back

4260
04:14:40,680 --> 04:14:45,880
hi how's runescaping we're doing good uh if you ever wanted to join in we're in world 3a

4261
04:14:46,440 --> 04:14:51,640
top right there uh why is my latest tip we're not working it should be rotating right now

4262
04:14:53,240 --> 04:15:02,200
sorry latest and uh and then we're gonna move to barbarian village next and we're gonna see what

4263
04:15:02,200 --> 04:15:14,840
happens if there's oh wait no we can hmm the problem is I don't want to mute the in-game chat

4264
04:15:14,840 --> 04:15:21,400
because of the bots I'm gonna go to bed have fun cooking oh well thank you for everything thank you

4265
04:15:21,400 --> 04:15:31,240
for the extortionate prices for the shearers and all that um I just realized we would probably have

4266
04:15:31,240 --> 04:15:39,320
to fat fly fish the fish ourselves unless we went to the grand exchange but only I have

4267
04:15:39,320 --> 04:15:46,520
access to all the fish in my inventory so it's not like we can share it out equally hmm the

4268
04:15:46,520 --> 04:15:53,640
bots on this world won't speak I mean I can't I just ignore them if we have to fly fish I think

4269
04:15:53,640 --> 04:16:01,320
we need like level 20 fishing so we would be here for a bit longer hmm but rest well there's

4270
04:16:01,320 --> 04:16:10,600
reeflings that do need to sleep yeah we would need 20 for the trout hmm oh sorry I just like we need

4271
04:16:10,920 --> 04:16:19,000
fish and wine maybe we should pray but how can fish fly are you telling me this fish flies

4272
04:16:25,560 --> 04:16:30,600
hmm I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm not sure you guys want to be held here for another

4273
04:16:31,960 --> 04:16:35,160
what it were until we get like the actual level needed

4274
04:16:35,640 --> 04:16:41,640
hmm I'm thinking but my brain isn't really coming up with any solutions it's either

4275
04:16:43,720 --> 04:16:47,480
no there is no solution we have to keep being here until level 20 fishing

4276
04:16:50,360 --> 04:16:55,480
and then we can move on it's gonna be a long road either well yeah literally if it takes 30 hours of

4277
04:16:57,160 --> 04:17:01,880
like are you telling me a shrimp right this way are you telling me I've cuddled this fish

4278
04:17:01,880 --> 04:17:07,400
yeah um if it's going to be a 30 hour stream anyway congrats on 20

4279
04:17:08,680 --> 04:17:15,800
no questing for airy levels suck hmm yeah we're also pretty low on combat for fresh

4280
04:17:15,800 --> 04:17:24,920
starts as well which is a bit hmm I don't know what we should do are you telling me I cuddled

4281
04:17:25,640 --> 04:17:28,280
exactly you can do

4282
04:17:30,600 --> 04:17:37,400
miss the mystery well here that quest is right here oh do we need okay how about that

4283
04:17:37,400 --> 04:17:42,120
we go for a T and a P and we're gonna do some more questing just to break up the the fishing

4284
04:17:42,120 --> 04:17:47,960
because that was quite a few levels we've got with fishing so we'll go do some questing and

4285
04:17:49,560 --> 04:17:52,760
and then it can be broken up a little bit because I don't want to like hurt you too much

4286
04:17:53,400 --> 04:17:58,440
just doing it over and over oh no you mean we have to stay here and keep chatting forever

4287
04:17:58,440 --> 04:18:04,040
I would hate that oh wow oh that would suck yeah I'm glad I'm glad you enjoy my rambles

4291
04:18:27,960 --> 04:18:34,360
bored out or not but we will start the cooking grind soon another German name for cuttlefish is

4296
04:19:14,200 --> 04:19:23,720
right now with that flexing Tintin fish equals an ink fish oh that's such a cool translation so Tintin

4297
04:19:24,520 --> 04:19:34,760
Tint as in tint of a color and it's ink tint and so it means tinted fish the tint of the ink oh that's

Wait, what do you mean disconnected? I'm not disconnected! Wait, why are you

4319
04:27:18,340 --> 04:27:24,260
greeting? What are you saying? She loves us. What? I never said that, didn't I?

4320
04:27:24,260 --> 04:27:31,620
Because I went for a tinkle. You have 30 days. She's back quick, hide the memes.

4321
04:27:31,620 --> 04:27:36,940
What were you doing while I was away? I've been away for a few minutes. How was the

4322
04:27:36,940 --> 04:27:42,060
pee? It was not a lot of liquid again and I've literally finished up all the

4323
04:27:42,060 --> 04:27:47,020
water. So, and I had a tea, and I finished a can of cola. I've got another bottle of

4324
04:27:47,020 --> 04:27:51,620
water here. I don't know if you can hear my nails kind of against it. I'm gonna

4325
04:27:51,620 --> 04:27:56,820
try and finish that and the tea. I'm not really sure what's going on.

4326
04:27:56,820 --> 04:28:03,540
I'm being pranked. I've been pranked by my body. Wait, why does someone say she

4327
04:28:03,540 --> 04:28:11,740
doesn't love us hard eyes? What? By the way, reeflings are the best. You say

4328
04:28:11,740 --> 04:28:18,980
Coca-Cola. I hear burps. Cola burps. Cola burps. We did kiss the homies. Don't tell

4329
04:28:18,980 --> 04:28:24,780
Amy that, she'll be jealous. I'm freaking, wait, I just caught an anchovy.

4330
04:28:24,820 --> 04:28:33,940
What does it do? Oh wait, I'm now catching an anchovy because I'm a level? Oh, maybe

4331
04:28:33,940 --> 04:28:40,420
that'll speed up the fishing level gain. Okay, I didn't know that. You put

4332
04:28:40,420 --> 04:28:46,340
anchovies on a pizza. I don't think I've ever tasted that before. Burps. Oh, I was

4333
04:28:46,340 --> 04:28:52,620
so proud when Shabee started burping in her streams. I was like, oh my god. My

4334
04:28:52,660 --> 04:28:59,140
literal daughter. Oh my god. With all the tea she drinks, Johnny will be really

4335
04:28:59,140 --> 04:29:13,740
sophisticated. That's not bad. The burps are hot. I don't understand the appeal of it,

4336
04:29:13,740 --> 04:29:24,500
but then someone said, think of it about the aftermath. Give your run air back, I

4337
04:29:24,500 --> 04:29:36,780
believe. We get to rate more mouth pranks. Why do you keep on firing? That's why

4338
04:29:36,780 --> 04:29:42,180
there's a freaking fire. I'm getting pranked by the spine. Oh, I'm still burning

4339
04:29:42,220 --> 04:29:49,780
stuff. I'm not level. I'm literally cooking level 22 and I'm still burning. That's pretty

4340
04:29:49,780 --> 04:29:56,260
rough after this. This is taking us a hot second. Right, so what fishing level do we need?

4341
04:29:56,260 --> 04:30:07,180
We need fishing level 20. Shabee made a burp speed. She's indeed cheaper. Exactly. That's what

4342
04:30:07,180 --> 04:30:15,260
I thought. Tea bag in the fire. It's running, I kneel. I get so many things like, oh, I kneel

4343
04:30:15,260 --> 04:30:20,500
for all the choices. The barbed village spot has a permanent fire to cook on. Oh, right,

4344
04:30:20,500 --> 04:30:30,220
I'll put my tinderbox and axe away. And then we will buy fishing gear. We farm until 20

4345
04:30:30,220 --> 04:30:34,300
fishing. I did know that. Yeah, we're going to do 20 fishing and then we're going to buy

4346
04:30:34,620 --> 04:30:42,780
rods because some of us don't have that attachment. And then we get to go to Barbarian Village and we

4347
04:30:42,780 --> 04:30:50,620
fish and we just keep doing that for a while. I think maybe we could get 40 doing that because

4348
04:30:50,620 --> 04:30:55,740
salmon. However, the problem is the cost of feathers, but the problem's already been solved

4349
04:30:55,740 --> 04:31:01,900
thanks to reeflings literally giving me an insane amount of in-game currency. Oh no,

4350
04:31:01,900 --> 04:31:07,980
we're doing a quest. I completely forgot. I apologize. We are fishing level 20 fishing and

4351
04:31:07,980 --> 04:31:11,900
then we're going to do a quest that's right here that begins with M. We're going to do maybe three

4352
04:31:11,900 --> 04:31:19,020
quests just to break up the little fishing segment a little bit. It's called Mythilene Mystery.

4353
04:31:19,020 --> 04:31:25,180
Mythilene Mystery. Burps are saying you ever like come through around someone. I am like, yeah.

4354
04:31:26,700 --> 04:31:30,060
Some people like get taught it's really rude manners. Like obviously it's rude,

4355
04:31:30,140 --> 04:31:36,380
like you wouldn't be in a job interview and burp in there. Actually speaking of burping in job

4356
04:31:36,380 --> 04:31:41,340
interviews, I'm like 90% sure I accidentally burped when I was interviewing one of the girls

4357
04:31:41,340 --> 04:31:47,580
revealer now that I think about it. Absolutely mortified. I think it might have been in me.

4358
04:31:47,580 --> 04:31:52,380
You know that? No, it couldn't have been in me. I think it might have been Mercy. Someone

4359
04:31:52,460 --> 04:31:54,620
had burped and I was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

4360
04:32:00,300 --> 04:32:03,180
Did you hear about the Talon chef who died? He passed away.

4361
04:32:06,940 --> 04:32:09,180
Oh, that didn't go, that didn't go down well.

4362
04:32:11,580 --> 04:32:18,620
32, I think to stop burping, burning shrimp. Level 32, you stop burning shrimp. That's insane.

4363
04:32:18,620 --> 04:32:24,700
Brian. Stronny, I hope you're proud. I was reading a comic earlier and all I heard was your

4364
04:32:24,700 --> 04:32:31,740
voice. I'm so cooked. Oh, did that actually happen? Am I in your head? Thank you,

4365
04:32:32,460 --> 04:32:36,860
Senpai. Am I in your head? Is my accent in your head?

4366
04:32:49,260 --> 04:32:53,500
Okay, hopefully that hypno's off, that reverbs off on the mic because I actually

4367
04:32:53,900 --> 04:32:56,060
I didn't say a thing that tells me if it's on or not.

4368
04:33:00,140 --> 04:33:08,700
Always in your head. Soon, world domination. Soon, the first 99 cooking, okay. It's more

4369
04:33:08,700 --> 04:33:19,980
attractive if someone doesn't care about it. Giving my wood the sort of group. What? Who is

4370
04:33:19,980 --> 04:33:24,380
Riefling is this? Come get your Riefling. You've been in my head for a long time, Stronny.

4371
04:33:26,700 --> 04:33:30,940
Cryo Freeze, Momento. See, Stronny, that's why I didn't want the undo button.

4372
04:33:31,580 --> 04:33:37,180
Want an undo button. Right, I'm definitely cooking fish a heck of a lot faster now.

4373
04:33:37,980 --> 04:33:39,980
Catching fish, my apologies, not cooking.

4374
04:33:50,620 --> 04:33:59,420
We need to video game OST ranking. Okay, that slightly slows down progress now that we're

4375
04:33:59,420 --> 04:34:05,260
also getting anchovies as well. I keep accidentally trying to use fish on people. I've literally

4376
04:34:05,340 --> 04:34:11,500
slapped so many Rieflings with shrimp right now and feel really bad. Hopefully touching

4377
04:34:11,500 --> 04:34:17,420
your legs with my shrimp. I'm like, please take my raw shrimp. At 21, I can finally turn cream.

4378
04:34:18,780 --> 04:34:21,020
But we all turn cream together at the same time.

4379
04:34:26,860 --> 04:34:33,340
If you look at it, it's kind of like a cute little fishing campsite. Riefling's on.

4380
04:34:35,580 --> 04:34:45,180
There's a place to turn cream and lump. Wait, we can actually do it?

4381
04:34:47,180 --> 04:34:51,500
Hey, I thought we had to wait for another time for doing that. Honestly, right by Farmer

4382
04:34:51,980 --> 04:34:55,740
I didn't even know you can turn by. Take it, take my raw shrimp.

4383
04:35:06,060 --> 04:35:10,860
I'm really happy that you said you love Germany. It's the first time we've worn something.

4384
04:35:11,740 --> 04:35:19,180
Deutschland Uber alles! Deutschland Uber alles! There you go. That's like all the German I could

4385
04:35:19,180 --> 04:35:23,580
come up with. Just Deutschland Uber alles. Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaver.

4386
04:35:25,980 --> 04:35:31,980
Wait, I don't know why. Nope, that wasn't it. Don't do that again. Why?

4387
04:35:36,060 --> 04:35:38,940
Hold on. I'm going to try, I don't know why it doesn't like that.

4388
04:35:39,420 --> 04:35:42,220
I don't know why it's frozen.

4389
04:35:46,940 --> 04:35:50,940
I'm so sorry, my little scroll and don't know things frozen. I'm gonna have to fix that next thing.

4390
04:35:52,140 --> 04:35:55,740
Well, no way you can say that. Wait, what does Deutschland Uber alles means?

4391
04:35:57,020 --> 04:36:00,540
Wait, if I just said something really bad, I thought it meant like Germany number one.

4392
04:36:00,540 --> 04:36:05,420
Like China number one. What did I just say in German?

4393
04:36:05,820 --> 04:36:08,780
Did I just say something really bad?

4394
04:36:10,940 --> 04:36:16,140
I thought it meant China number one, but German number one. What did I just say?

4395
04:36:23,180 --> 04:36:25,980
Did I just say something really bad? It sounds like...

4396
04:36:26,300 --> 04:36:34,620
No, it's fine, but it can be associated with other stuff. I am so sorry,

4397
04:36:36,620 --> 04:36:38,700
bitter. I am so sorry.

4398
04:36:42,460 --> 04:36:50,540
I thought it meant China number one. Let's just forget about it. I am so sorry. I genuinely

4399
04:36:50,540 --> 04:36:53,900
thought it meant China number one, but Germany number one.

4400
04:36:56,940 --> 04:37:00,860
When you learned your German from Call of Duty, unironically, like...

4401
04:37:01,740 --> 04:37:07,580
Oh my God, idiot, absolute idiot. I'm so sorry. I do apologize for that.

4402
04:37:09,980 --> 04:37:14,860
It's the first line of a national anthem. Oh wait, it's the first line of the national...

4403
04:37:14,860 --> 04:37:15,980
German national anthem?

4404
04:37:19,420 --> 04:37:23,500
It's only problematic if you use in a specific contact. Oh, okay.

4405
04:37:24,380 --> 04:37:30,300
Shawnee, tomorrow will start to pop out strange fan art of you in a strange and nostalgic outfit.

4406
04:37:37,980 --> 04:37:42,380
Just remember, I don't own rights to previous things. That's what you're gonna...

4407
04:37:42,940 --> 04:37:47,260
Like, I might not be able to interact with it if you're maybe getting a bit too cheeky.

4408
04:37:48,140 --> 04:37:53,660
Yeah, their national anthem from 1930s. Wait, not... I'm sorry, I really didn't...

4409
04:37:54,300 --> 04:37:57,500
Which Germany... Oh God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4410
04:37:59,980 --> 04:38:04,700
Oh, genuinely thought it meant China number one. Like, I don't know if you guys ever played

4411
04:38:05,260 --> 04:38:13,180
pub G or something, pub Newgrounds or whatever. But everyone used to come in and go China number

4412
04:38:13,180 --> 04:38:19,100
one. And that was it. That's basically what I thought I just said, but I did not say that at all.

4413
04:38:22,060 --> 04:38:25,420
Don't worry, I'm new here. How do I find where you are on the map?

4414
04:38:26,780 --> 04:38:31,580
So when you open up map, you will start here right outside of Lumberge.

4415
04:38:32,860 --> 04:38:37,980
And you just take a... Or maybe you started at the quest guy. He's like literally right here.

4416
04:38:37,980 --> 04:38:42,940
You want to go south. You can always use this cross here and click it and it will make everything

4417
04:38:43,420 --> 04:38:49,180
like north point north. And then just come south through a graveyard and we are literally all here.

4418
04:38:50,540 --> 04:38:53,740
So south through a graveyard and south again.

4419
04:38:55,340 --> 04:38:55,820
Brian!

4420
04:38:58,940 --> 04:39:03,500
I'm so sorry. I didn't... I genuinely didn't know what it meant. I do apologize.

4421
04:39:04,700 --> 04:39:10,540
I thought like... I thought everyone was like yay because I said Germany number one.

4422
04:39:10,620 --> 04:39:16,300
And there's a few German watchers and no, I'm just an idiot. So yep, there's that. Apologies.

4423
04:39:17,180 --> 04:39:21,500
Sorry. Thank you for the tip. I do apologize.

4424
04:39:23,900 --> 04:39:29,900
Ah, cringing at myself. I'm like, oh, maybe I should cut that segment out of the void honestly.

4425
04:39:29,900 --> 04:39:34,620
I don't want anything happening. Like anything weird happening. Don't stress about it.

4426
04:39:35,820 --> 04:39:37,020
Okay, I'll try to get there.

4427
04:39:41,500 --> 04:39:45,820
I can't stop laughing. No, I don't laugh at me. I literally... Anyone got a fire?

4428
04:39:47,820 --> 04:39:51,340
Yeah, probably take that out. I want to ask, how are you already so good at this?

4429
04:39:51,340 --> 04:39:56,460
I watched someone else try and they only have two quests left in FTP but still need attack.

4430
04:39:56,460 --> 04:40:01,580
Oh, I'm not good at the game. What? You were literally in it with us. I'm rubbish at the game.

4431
04:40:02,620 --> 04:40:08,860
Well, actually we have one, two, three, four and five. We have five quests done.

4432
04:40:08,860 --> 04:40:14,060
Oh wait, are you memeing? I watched someone try and they only have two quests left in FTP

4433
04:40:14,060 --> 04:40:17,900
but still need a taxi to Viroc. Oh right, because I actually threw the game.

4434
04:40:18,540 --> 04:40:24,060
What's the timestamp? Hold on. Four hours and like 38 minutes.

4435
04:40:25,980 --> 04:40:32,060
Hold on, I need to make more of that. Four hours, 48 minutes.

4436
04:40:39,100 --> 04:40:43,900
Oh, be on my... Right, there we go, wrote a note.

4437
04:40:44,860 --> 04:40:46,620
Time to get this board chopped up.

4438
04:40:48,460 --> 04:40:51,580
We have other... Another 90 levels of cooking in front of us.

4439
04:40:51,580 --> 04:40:56,940
Don't let your... Your not... Sorry, the love heart's in the freaking way.

4440
04:40:56,940 --> 04:40:59,740
In fact, it's in the way again. You're not Dutch knowledge, so...

4441
04:41:00,620 --> 04:41:06,060
Hello, I am a Dutchman. I know how to speak Dutch.

4442
04:41:06,060 --> 04:41:09,980
Yes, I know how to speak Dutch.

4443
04:41:11,660 --> 04:41:17,500
Only 13 million XP to go. No, no, no cuttles, we're laughing with you. I was laughing at you.

4444
04:41:17,500 --> 04:41:18,220
Okay, okay.

4445
04:41:20,940 --> 04:41:24,700
Relaxing stream. Okay, I'm glad you find it chill like that.

4446
04:41:25,020 --> 04:41:31,900
I'm sorry, I'm at the stage where I'm now cringing at myself thinking

4447
04:41:32,860 --> 04:41:37,340
I thought that meant Germany number one in all the contexts that I'd ever seen that phrase.

4448
04:41:41,820 --> 04:41:47,020
Anyway, I'm going to drink my tea and I'm probably going to cringe myself to sleep tonight.

4449
04:41:49,740 --> 04:41:53,740
Have you declared... Have you declared war to something with that sentence or opened a bakery?

4450
04:41:53,740 --> 04:41:55,900
Good people. Hopefully the bakery.

4451
04:41:57,100 --> 04:42:02,700
You're fine. Oh no, is there fire maker going offline? I will make us a fire, don't you worry.

4452
04:42:03,660 --> 04:42:08,140
Come, let me go get a tree. I think there's a tree in the swamp or something.

4453
04:42:10,940 --> 04:42:14,060
Is there not a dead tree in here? Am I going crazy?

4454
04:42:16,460 --> 04:42:20,220
I could have sworn there's like a dead tree in the swamp that you can... Oh, there is.

4455
04:42:21,180 --> 04:42:26,060
I'm going to get jumped by a frog, but I'm going to be so quick with froggy and got time to attack me.

4456
04:42:26,780 --> 04:42:33,740
Oh, I'm full. All right, drop, take the tree, and then run all the way back to the tree.

4457
04:42:34,780 --> 04:42:41,100
Oh, you made fire. Sorry. Oh my god, my woodcutting is so bad. It's going to take forever to cut this tree.

4458
04:42:41,980 --> 04:42:48,460
Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it. I have 50, not to brag or anything, but I've got 50 XP in woodcutting.

4459
04:42:50,540 --> 04:42:56,940
Let's see. Okay, okay, we're back, we're back, we're back.

4460
04:43:08,540 --> 04:43:15,820
Just so you know, Germany number one means Deutschland of dying irons. Maybe next time. Yeah.

4461
04:43:16,300 --> 04:43:21,580
Deutschland, Deutschland of dying irons.

4462
04:43:25,100 --> 04:43:31,420
We're learning who said streams and educate your man, huh? Get that on fire.

4463
04:43:35,820 --> 04:43:40,380
A whole 50, literally, not to brag.

4464
04:43:41,340 --> 04:43:46,700
What if you moved on to higher tier fish? So we're currently trying to get fishing level 20,

4465
04:43:46,700 --> 04:43:49,740
and then we're going to do some questing just to get over all XP,

4466
04:43:51,340 --> 04:43:56,620
and then we're going to move on to higher level fish, just to kind of break it up with a bit of fun

4467
04:43:56,620 --> 04:44:04,940
questing in between. I hope I don't pass out too early to the confidence of this company and me so hard.

4468
04:44:05,660 --> 04:44:17,500
Learning that a Scottish cut official of Germany, yes, this is educational content you've chosen one for.

4469
04:44:27,500 --> 04:44:29,500
Are you squidding me right now?

4470
04:44:30,460 --> 04:44:33,100
If it's for you, then we'll start the third world.

4471
04:44:40,780 --> 04:44:50,860
Thank you for the tip, iron reefer, hardy har har. No, no, bad Brian. Don't read that out loud, Brian.

4472
04:44:50,940 --> 04:45:00,060
That's naughty. There'll be no world wars. If anything, I'm actually a field medic,

4473
04:45:01,500 --> 04:45:08,060
so I'm here to stitch you up and give you all negative blood when you're perishing from blood loss.

4474
04:45:08,460 --> 04:45:16,620
I'm literally a bad boy, Brian, bad boy. Don't say that out loud. Oh my gosh.

4475
04:45:20,380 --> 04:45:26,300
No AI, the AI uprising. What's going on here? Oh, I'm itching my little schnozer. I'm going to

4476
04:45:26,300 --> 04:45:35,180
take a sip of my tea and see if it's, oh my god, it's the perfect sipping temperature,

4477
04:45:35,180 --> 04:45:39,260
truly a British moment when you enjoy, when you appreciate the temperature of the tea.

4478
04:45:42,940 --> 04:45:47,020
What are we on for fishing? Oh wait, I'm on 18 fishing. What are you guys on for fishing? We

4479
04:45:47,020 --> 04:45:51,500
must be getting close. We can do the quest very shortly. I'm going to put all of this in my bank

4480
04:45:51,500 --> 04:45:58,860
though. I am not questing with all of this money on me. Sorry, don't kill some of the money. I'm

4481
04:45:58,860 --> 04:46:11,580
zero negative life. The perfect cup of the perfect time, perfect dunking. Oh, what are they called?

4482
04:46:11,580 --> 04:46:16,460
Apparently custard cream's got named the best dunkable biscuit. Oh, you're like, how are you

4483
04:46:16,460 --> 04:46:22,140
guys higher level than me, honestly? Yeah, are you cheesy, don't run.

4484
04:46:28,380 --> 04:46:29,820
Did the Scott have a British moment?

4485
04:46:32,300 --> 04:46:40,220
Unfortunately, I do seem to share some traits. Can I even light logs or is it going to take forever?

4486
04:46:40,220 --> 04:46:47,420
Because I'm such a low level in fire like making three, four. Oh, it took me four times.

4487
04:46:47,420 --> 04:46:52,540
Honestly, that wasn't that bad. 15, but I had to step away a few times. Ah.

4488
04:46:54,700 --> 04:46:58,460
Oh, you had to step away because my, my soundboard jokes were just too good.

4489
04:47:02,620 --> 04:47:06,220
Remember the one time when Facebook released an AI on the internet and learned from the

4490
04:47:06,220 --> 04:47:09,180
community that turned into the biggest thing going wrong?

4491
04:47:16,140 --> 04:47:19,420
Oh, it's four men in uniform to carry my little souls through home.

4492
04:47:19,420 --> 04:47:28,060
What should he do? Should have been a musician, but he didn't have the money for a guitar.

4493
04:47:29,100 --> 04:47:35,900
What should he do? Should have been a politician, but he didn't have a property. This is not the

4494
04:47:35,900 --> 04:47:42,460
song that was. Did we do it? We're almost there. We flings. We're so close to 20.

4495
04:47:43,900 --> 04:47:48,300
We're so close. By the way, do you have a plan for stages of cooking levels that would do it

4496
04:47:48,300 --> 04:47:56,700
chilling spot until 99? I absolutely have no plan whatsoever. I've returned with logs for my fire duty.

4497
04:47:58,540 --> 04:48:04,540
I honestly have no plan whatsoever. We're going to move on to Salmon and Trout at

4498
04:48:04,540 --> 04:48:10,700
Barbarian Village after we do some questing. And then after that, I think it's just jugs of wine.

4499
04:48:10,700 --> 04:48:14,620
And we're literally going to be hanging out like maybe at the Grand Exchange on like a very quiet

4500
04:48:14,700 --> 04:48:24,220
server. Oh, level 19 fishing. There might be a quest we're going to do.

4501
04:48:26,540 --> 04:48:32,540
Sorry for letting my inner German out, my guess. By the way, do you, oh no, the fact that she didn't

4502
04:48:32,540 --> 04:48:36,140
correct the message does mean that she already chose to go straight to level 99.

4503
04:48:36,860 --> 04:48:40,620
Yeah, that's the plan anyway. We're going to do some questing just to break it up.

4504
04:48:40,700 --> 04:48:50,380
And then we are going to jump back into it. I want to see if maybe we could do level 40 today.

4505
04:48:50,380 --> 04:48:54,940
I don't think I'm going to do a full endurance stream as much as I love to harass you guys

4506
04:48:55,900 --> 04:49:01,020
and destroy your sleep pattern. I don't think we're going to do a full 12 hour stream today.

4507
04:49:02,300 --> 04:49:08,780
Also, my freaking VOD broke. Apparently the VODs break on 11 hours and 55 minutes,

4508
04:49:08,780 --> 04:49:14,780
not on the 12th hour. So the end of my VOD got chopped away and it just cuts off.

4509
04:49:16,540 --> 04:49:26,780
15 trout, 20 is and 25 is salmon. Oh, we can make apple pies. Oh, I have a muffin.

4510
04:49:28,380 --> 04:49:30,700
I have an apple muffin. I forgot to eat it yesterday.

4511
04:49:31,180 --> 04:49:35,980
Yeah, something's like not really...

4512
04:49:37,100 --> 04:49:39,740
YouTube VODs are almost especially the longer ones. Yeah.

4513
04:49:41,340 --> 04:49:45,660
Oh, is it displaying again correctly? Maybe it changed. Yeah, they told us.

4514
04:49:46,780 --> 04:49:49,820
That is a sad and frightening, so speaking super fast.

4515
04:49:53,420 --> 04:49:56,860
M&M's got nothing on me when I'm saying bioreflums. Okay, I'm like,

4516
04:50:01,660 --> 04:50:06,300
eh, that explains why all the other VJubers stopped 10 minutes before the 12 hour mark.

4517
04:50:06,300 --> 04:50:12,620
Yeah, so unfortunately, we are having to bend the knee to the VOD overlords. I wonder,

4518
04:50:12,620 --> 04:50:15,900
I suppose they had to give a number, like it doesn't matter.

4519
04:50:18,540 --> 04:50:26,060
Circum... wait, I thought it said circumstance. Sure, you're not a mumble rat. Oh, I'm a mumble

4520
04:50:26,060 --> 04:50:34,700
rat. I can assure you that much. I'm annunciating the words right now. I'm annunciating. Any annunciators?

4521
04:50:40,540 --> 04:50:41,900
Oh, come on, catch that last one.

4522
04:50:44,380 --> 04:50:53,260
Anything to do with this inventory full of shrimp? Drop them. If you go, you cook them on the fire

4523
04:50:53,260 --> 04:50:58,780
and then you drop them once they're all cooked. It sounds like a decision made for some technical

4524
04:50:58,780 --> 04:51:03,260
reason over at you. Yeah, like, I assumed they had to put like a number on it, but they couldn't

4525
04:51:03,260 --> 04:51:10,220
just infinitely do it. Although there's those accounts that used to infinitely stream music,

4526
04:51:10,220 --> 04:51:15,740
was it lo-fi girl or something like that? They just like constantly like keep going.

4527
04:51:16,300 --> 04:51:23,660
I'll chug them all. If you go into sentence, you can hit, I think it's like controls or something,

4528
04:51:23,660 --> 04:51:27,820
and it's like use shift to drop, and then if you hold shift, you can drop your full inventory stack

4529
04:51:27,820 --> 04:51:42,700
really quickly. Okay, level 25 cooking. I'll take it, like we're getting there. It's if I could stop

4530
04:51:42,700 --> 04:51:47,580
burning this stuff, if we stop burning, we'd be like literally flying through the levels.

4531
04:51:48,140 --> 04:51:56,780
Right, 20 is maybe one more deck officially. Lo-fi girl never saved vods and didn't let you

4532
04:51:56,780 --> 04:52:04,540
rewind, so that could be why. We are learning. Okay, more of my tea. I keep forgetting.

4533
04:52:08,700 --> 04:52:10,460
And these fishes are hiding from me.

4534
04:52:13,580 --> 04:52:20,140
So I assume it costs money to get some of these hysterics costumes, because

4535
04:52:20,940 --> 04:52:26,940
these are like total costumes. I have to go in 10 minutes. I can't stay on Firejoy forever.

4536
04:52:26,940 --> 04:52:31,180
Yes, that's okay. Don't worry, we can take over. We're probably doing by Quest next.

4537
04:52:32,220 --> 04:52:39,820
But thank you for your service. Wait, hold on, 07. Thank you for your service on Firejoy. 07,

4538
04:52:39,820 --> 04:52:47,980
we salute. Yeah, Wi-Fi, low-fi girl is more like a follower radio channel.

4539
04:52:47,980 --> 04:52:54,300
Yeah. The only MTX in old-school RuneScape is Bond.

4540
04:53:00,060 --> 04:53:05,020
You can stream non-stop, but when you end the VOD, it will only save the foot 11.55.

4541
04:53:05,100 --> 04:53:14,060
Hmm. Well, I'll need to know that for the Donathons, because Azuras is first.

4542
04:53:16,380 --> 04:53:20,860
20! I'm finally fishing level 20. That took so long.

4543
04:53:24,620 --> 04:53:31,980
I can drop them. Okay, we're level 20. We're gonna do questing once I finish this batch that I've got.

4544
04:53:32,940 --> 04:53:37,180
And then we'll go to the bank and drop off all our items and see what this Quest

4545
04:53:37,180 --> 04:53:40,460
mini thing is all about. I don't know if I need any items for it, is it this?

4546
04:53:41,820 --> 04:53:44,460
It began with an M, so let's scroll down to M.

4547
04:53:48,060 --> 04:53:49,420
Let's scroll up to M.

4548
04:53:53,740 --> 04:54:00,460
Mystery, what do we need for that? We need, oh, we get a reward. What do we need for it?

4549
04:54:00,460 --> 04:54:08,620
Recommended items, none. Enemies to defeat, none. Okay, right. We'll definitely do this.

4550
04:54:09,260 --> 04:54:14,700
Nicely. Oh, she is right there. Okay, that makes perfect sense by that reefling. Suggested that

4551
04:54:15,820 --> 04:54:22,540
silly of me. If we're going to do some quests, we're going to the city, then we're going to the

4552
04:54:22,540 --> 04:54:28,540
city, then the door closes, won't close back. We're gonna put our items away first before we

4553
04:54:28,540 --> 04:54:32,140
continue with the questing. I actually have to go to, don't worry if you have to go,

4554
04:54:32,140 --> 04:54:37,260
thank you so much reeflings for hanging, I appreciate it. I am going to try and get level

4555
04:54:37,260 --> 04:54:43,500
99 in one month for cooking, so there will be plentiful opportunities to come hang.

4556
04:54:44,380 --> 04:54:49,020
I'm also going to do it during the week instead of on the weekend as well to give

4557
04:54:50,460 --> 04:54:56,380
the people who work on the weekends a chance as well to come in and join in the fun.

4558
04:54:58,540 --> 04:55:04,700
Okay, everyone who is fishing, if you want to cook the fish, we're going to take it to the bank,

4559
04:55:04,700 --> 04:55:09,020
if you want to cook it the new, and then we're going to make our way to the castle,

4560
04:55:09,020 --> 04:55:15,500
and then we're going to come back and, oh, my fire, my fire perished.

4561
04:55:17,180 --> 04:55:24,300
So get cooking, good looking. Oh wait, that's the song, hey, good looking. What you got cooking?

4562
04:55:25,100 --> 04:55:30,140
It's shrimp on a fire, shrimp on the barbie. Oh, we're so Aussie out here.

4563
04:55:31,260 --> 04:55:40,540
Can you go back to the mystery area after you finish? Oh wait, should we just do the quest?

4564
04:55:43,180 --> 04:55:46,940
Reeflings have done the quest, should we just do the quest now instead of going all the way back

4565
04:55:46,940 --> 04:55:57,740
and like here again? I finished my tea, yeah, you can't. Do they actually eat a lot of shrimp

4566
04:55:57,740 --> 04:56:02,380
in Aussie land? I don't know, just do the quest, okay, we'll do the quest.

4567
04:56:06,380 --> 04:56:09,900
I'll wait for everyone to finish up and do their thing, and then we'll start.

4568
04:56:10,860 --> 04:56:16,860
So let you guys cook, those who are fishing, you can un-fish and cook, and then we'll start

4569
04:56:16,860 --> 04:56:23,420
with this quest, and we'll pick another one. We'll do three quests I think, and I either need to do

4570
04:56:23,420 --> 04:56:31,740
stream split recording, yeah, for the donathons, I know you need to do back to back, so I'm actually

4571
04:56:31,740 --> 04:56:35,980
gonna have to get like a video put together for Azura to play when she goes to sleep.

4572
04:56:35,980 --> 04:56:41,420
Hopefully her PC doesn't explode midstream. Should be a way to sleep in the thing just

4573
04:56:42,540 --> 04:56:45,100
catch some fire in the corner of the room and she's like, okay.

4574
04:56:50,780 --> 04:56:57,340
We eat prawns. Are you squidding me right now? Who goes there Brian? Do you read Patreon messages?

4575
04:56:58,060 --> 04:57:02,380
No, so none of the talents have access to Patreon messages because it's like direct

4576
04:57:02,460 --> 04:57:08,860
messages, so they don't have access to that stuff? No. So no, I read Marshmallows though,

4577
04:57:08,860 --> 04:57:17,980
your mother won't come to send a moishie. I'm drinking water now after finishing my tea.

4578
04:57:23,180 --> 04:57:29,100
Okay, is everyone almost ready? I'm gonna drop three inventory space, I'll just drop

4579
04:57:29,100 --> 04:57:35,900
three anchovies, why not? Right, we will talk to this lady, I'll put walking on.

4580
04:57:36,540 --> 04:57:45,580
Let's see what happens. Help, help! Start the quest. Sure, are you guys ready to come over?

4581
04:57:47,340 --> 04:57:50,940
I'll get to 20 later. Yeah, we can always come back and do our thing.

4582
04:57:53,260 --> 04:57:58,140
Thank you for the tip though Anonymous. You really are shy, you could ask that for free,

4583
04:57:58,140 --> 04:58:02,380
you didn't have to give me money to ask that question. You guys are always welcome to ask and

4584
04:58:02,380 --> 04:58:06,140
chat, I know it can be never again, or you can ask in Marshmallow but I might be sold to respond

4585
04:58:06,140 --> 04:58:12,300
because I'm not reading Marshmallows right now. Thank you for the tip but save your money at the

4586
04:58:12,300 --> 04:58:20,060
same time, seriously. Ray, are we ready? Are you my refillings? You are. You're not quite ready,

4587
04:58:20,060 --> 04:58:26,700
hold on. Oh, sorry, right, I'm accepting the quest. What has happened here? We were invited to

4588
04:58:26,700 --> 04:58:30,140
house party on the island, not far from here, something felt wrong about the whole thing but

4589
04:58:30,140 --> 04:58:33,900
we went away. The house seemed pretty creepy but everything was going fine, we were having a good

4590
04:58:33,900 --> 04:58:40,700
time and that's when we got attacked and I tried to save her. Huey brought me enough time to find

4591
04:58:40,700 --> 04:58:46,140
an old boat, I went back to get him but it was too late, I'm scared he won't make it. You have to do

4592
04:58:46,140 --> 04:58:52,700
something, they can't get away with this. What do you want me to do? That cycle is still out there,

4593
04:58:52,700 --> 04:58:57,900
you have to bring them to justice. The boat we escaped on is just over there and you can use

4594
04:58:57,900 --> 04:59:04,220
it to get to the island. Okay, I'll see what I can do. I need to fight, I hope not. Can reflings see

4595
04:59:04,220 --> 04:59:16,060
this boat over here? Are you pointing the way? Let's check that you're all here. Who's got a

4596
04:59:16,060 --> 04:59:24,860
refling? Got a few. Okay, end of the boat, end of the boat. Benjens, how bold of you considering

4597
04:59:24,860 --> 04:59:29,980
she has a plan? Strania, I was wondering if you were following some kind of gay deciding to do,

4598
04:59:29,980 --> 04:59:34,300
nah I'm just going for it. We're literally doing quest and right now like I'm already getting distracted

4599
04:59:35,500 --> 04:59:42,940
from the 99 grind. Okay, I think that's all my reflings, these are

4600
04:59:43,820 --> 04:59:50,540
actual plots. Okay, into the boat we go, yippee! There's a chance you ask the question and

4601
04:59:50,540 --> 04:59:55,740
check, typically better chance, I don't know. I know but you can still do it for free, just

4602
04:59:55,740 --> 05:00:02,540
like keep, like if I miss it then ask it again in like a couple of minutes. Oh my god, there's so

4603
05:00:02,540 --> 05:00:07,740
many of us doing this quest right now, we're gonna overload this. It looks kind of familiar.

4604
05:00:07,980 --> 05:00:15,980
Oh, okay, we need to take a left refling, for those of you who don't have the plugin,

4605
05:00:16,860 --> 05:00:21,740
we're gonna pick up this bucket right here on the left. Oh no, is it instance bucket? Why are

4606
05:00:21,740 --> 05:00:29,100
we taking the bucket? Pick up from the bucket, is it an instance bucket? Oh no, we can all take it,

4607
05:00:29,100 --> 05:00:38,700
okay, that's good. Okay, drop. Okay, everyone get a bucket, pick up your bucket, subscribe by the

4608
05:00:38,700 --> 05:00:49,260
fountain. Oh my god, the beacons are lit, Gondor calls trade. Okay, and then we have the barrel

4609
05:00:50,140 --> 05:00:57,100
of rainwater, interact with it, we need to search it. Okay, there's like lots of noises going on.

4610
05:00:59,740 --> 05:01:09,420
Whoa, party on, bro. Oh, it's like that movie that I've not seen. Whoa, the wind totally just felt

4611
05:01:09,420 --> 05:01:23,900
like sun breathing on my neck. Oh, not cool, bro. I feel woozy, gurg, I see the light. It's not my

4612
05:01:23,900 --> 05:01:29,820
time, glurg, glurgle, gargle. Oh, that's a bit. I don't know what movie he's from, I've not seen it,

4613
05:01:30,620 --> 05:01:36,460
but I've seen it, you know what I mean? I've not seen the movie. Help me.

4614
05:01:39,740 --> 05:01:44,540
Man, you're taking a while to perish. Sid claps is on the ground in a crumpled mess,

4615
05:01:44,540 --> 05:01:49,900
as he falls down, you spot something shiny fall out of his shirt pocket and into the barrel of water.

4616
05:01:50,860 --> 05:01:57,820
Gosh, that was horrible and so drawn out. Oh, wow, he's still going.

4617
05:02:01,340 --> 05:02:05,500
I think he's actually gone this time. Who are you? Why are you doing this?

4618
05:02:07,340 --> 05:02:14,300
He didn't say anything. Scary movie. Oh, it's scream. I've got to find a way into that house and stop

4619
05:02:14,460 --> 05:02:21,660
this maniac. I wonder what it is that I saw fall into that barrel. Search the barrel,

4620
05:02:21,660 --> 05:02:27,340
reflings. The barrel's full of rainwater. I can't see what's in there. Oh, right, click on the barrel

4621
05:02:27,340 --> 05:02:32,060
in your inventory and use it on the barrel of rainwater. You fill the bucket from the barrel.

4622
05:02:32,060 --> 05:02:37,260
Okay, now what? Now we search the barrel. You find a key at the bottom of the barrel.

4623
05:02:38,060 --> 05:02:46,060
Are you saying strongly? Okay, now we go to the front of the house.

4624
05:02:50,380 --> 05:02:55,660
It's so scary. Oh, it's making a good noise.

4625
05:02:59,180 --> 05:03:04,460
Chop down. No, open large door. Okay, here we go. The bunny went ahead. I saw that bunny.

4626
05:03:04,460 --> 05:03:11,020
He closed the door behind you. Let us in the house. Right, there we go. Oh, the door all

4627
05:03:11,020 --> 05:03:17,100
closes. Hold on. I think the door all closed. Oh, does it all close? Wait, I can't even get in.

4628
05:03:17,100 --> 05:03:23,660
Is this open large door? No. I think we're all trying to get in at once, right? I'm not clicking

4629
05:03:23,660 --> 05:03:32,780
it. I'm just, okay, Danny. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, all right, I'm getting there. We're getting

4630
05:03:33,420 --> 05:03:38,940
there. We're getting there. Hold on. Hold on. Why am I not going inside? It's not because someone's

4631
05:03:38,940 --> 05:03:47,420
doing the door thing. It's one at a time. Right, okay, that's fine. Okay, okay, I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.

4632
05:03:47,420 --> 05:03:52,860
Okay. Oh, that took the hot thing there. Right, let's get the other reflins in. Everyone in, everyone

4633
05:03:52,860 --> 05:03:58,540
in. Okay, a few more. A few more reflins, fewer stragglers. Can you come? Can you come?

4634
05:03:59,260 --> 05:04:07,660
One more, one more, and you come, and you come. Click that door. Right, we're in, we're in.

4635
05:04:07,660 --> 05:04:14,300
Everyone touch the table in the entrance way. Oh my goodness. There's a knife on the table.

4636
05:04:14,300 --> 05:04:20,940
Touch that table. Ooh, we're touching the table. Okay, once you've touched the table,

4637
05:04:20,940 --> 05:04:32,460
touch this door. Ooh, the door, the door. Oh, cut scene. Knock, knock. Who's there? Oh, no.

4638
05:04:34,780 --> 05:04:42,620
Gurgle. Oh, he said you're next to me.

4639
05:04:42,780 --> 05:04:51,100
Oh, he's using cheat see doodles. What's this? A note? I guess I should read it.

4640
05:04:51,100 --> 05:04:56,380
Ooh, let's go get the note. Oh, you left the note, okay. It should be a note to your left.

4641
05:04:56,380 --> 05:05:02,220
You take a copy of the note. Ooh, let's read it. Isn't murder just the work of art,

4642
05:05:02,220 --> 05:05:07,020
beautiful yet haunting like the blade of a knife as we wander through the valley of death?

4643
05:05:07,020 --> 05:05:19,340
Ooh, spooky. Oh, okay. Is this on the other side? Oh, okay. Everyone enter this room.

4644
05:05:19,340 --> 05:05:24,620
It doesn't really, really much of a room. Oh, it's a some room anyway. Oh, look at this painting.

4645
05:05:24,620 --> 05:05:32,620
Wait, why am I getting turned this way for the painting? Hello? Hello? Okay, examine painting.

4646
05:05:33,420 --> 05:05:40,060
Wait, what am I supposed to do? Oh, use the knife on the painting. I didn't

4647
05:05:40,060 --> 05:05:43,180
even know I had a knife on me. Use the knife in your inventory on the painting.

4648
05:05:44,220 --> 05:05:48,700
Beat that painting up. Show it to your mean boss. You slash open the painting revealing

4649
05:05:48,700 --> 05:05:57,660
a hidden storage compartment. Search painting. You find a key hidden inside the slash painting.

4650
05:05:57,660 --> 05:06:03,500
Oh, okay. If you found your key, come back out into the entrance way. If you've got the key

4651
05:06:03,500 --> 05:06:09,500
from the painting by cutting it up into the entrance way. Okay, just a few more.

4652
05:06:10,860 --> 05:06:16,300
Use the knife in your inventory on the painting in that room. And then once you've got the key,

4653
05:06:16,300 --> 05:06:23,340
come back into the hallway. We're doing it. We're questing. They have a higher pit than you.

4654
05:06:24,300 --> 05:06:26,700
Man, what's a pit?

4655
05:06:30,860 --> 05:06:31,420
Are we good?

4656
05:06:34,300 --> 05:06:41,660
There should be a knife in your inventory. And then you can highlight it by using right click

4657
05:06:41,660 --> 05:06:50,860
and then slash the shizzle of it. There you go, you key. Alrighty. And then we go through this door

4658
05:06:50,860 --> 05:07:01,660
right here. Oh, there's a reefing party in here, clearly. Oh, so it's spooking us behind the door.

4659
05:07:03,500 --> 05:07:07,820
Okay, once you enter this new room, there's a little orby thing to the left. I don't know

4660
05:07:07,820 --> 05:07:14,460
what it does, but it's highlighted. Examine the unlit candle on the wall. Oh, we're to tinder box

4661
05:07:15,420 --> 05:07:22,060
or to tinder box, the thing on the wall. Tinder box, the unlit candle.

4662
05:07:24,380 --> 05:07:27,500
Oh, wait, do you guys need a knife or a tinder box or is it like in this room?

4663
05:07:32,860 --> 05:07:36,620
Do you guys need me to trade this? There's a bunch in here. Okay, okay, that's good.

4664
05:07:37,180 --> 05:07:40,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, literally all in the shelf. There's a tinder box on the shelf if you need help.

4665
05:07:41,660 --> 05:07:46,140
You light the candle. So light the two unlit candles. Oh, there's a third one as well.

4666
05:07:46,140 --> 05:07:51,660
Oh, excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Video Game. Oh, I just touched my fish. Hold on, wait.

4667
05:07:56,220 --> 05:07:59,980
I think she's more happy of the fact that there's only 20 people doing the same.

4668
05:08:01,180 --> 05:08:07,660
Literally, Jagex is like, what on earth? I'm sure they've had it before where people go

4669
05:08:07,660 --> 05:08:12,620
questing together. You light the candle. The room is sufficiently warm. The fuse

4670
05:08:12,620 --> 05:08:21,900
should now have dried out. Oh, once you tinder box all the things, do the barrel?

4671
05:08:24,620 --> 05:08:29,420
I don't know. And get the heck out of the room. Get out of the room as soon as you light that thing.

4672
05:08:29,420 --> 05:08:34,220
Hold on, let me run. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room.

4673
05:08:34,300 --> 05:08:41,420
Oh, the thing about to blow. Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4674
05:08:44,460 --> 05:08:49,900
All right. Hey, it's the shadow one that kept closing the doors on me.

4675
05:08:51,900 --> 05:08:56,700
That's not a knife. This is a knife. Why are you so excited if I touch the doors and noodles?

4676
05:08:56,700 --> 05:09:00,700
I'm just like, it's so fun being like, oh my God, request them together. And for those

4677
05:09:00,700 --> 05:09:06,220
who don't have room light, I'm like, I'm the quest teller, you know? So once you've let everything

4678
05:09:06,220 --> 05:09:10,860
and blew it up, we can all go outside in this section. So I'll wait for the reeflings to come

4679
05:09:10,860 --> 05:09:13,820
over. Yeah, they're like having to get out the room because it's blowing up.

4680
05:09:15,900 --> 05:09:22,540
I just find it really fun getting to play games together. Momelo. So we're getting

4681
05:09:23,260 --> 05:09:26,460
the God Sword, right? I don't know what the God Sword is.

4682
05:09:27,340 --> 05:09:33,500
We are all here merely by coincidence. There's absolutely nothing in common that we all have.

4683
05:09:38,620 --> 05:09:42,380
Is there anyone else in sake? Are you kidding me right now?

4684
05:09:42,940 --> 05:09:49,340
Brian. It's 1am. I have to tap out. Sleep well. Enjoy the rest of your stream with the reeflings.

4685
05:09:49,340 --> 05:09:53,980
Thank you so much, Pajango. Please rest well. Maybe see you in the morning. I don't know if

4686
05:09:53,980 --> 05:09:59,900
this is endurance yet. Yes, there's four candles in that room to light on the walls. You take a

4687
05:09:59,900 --> 05:10:05,660
tinder box from the shelf, little tinder box on the shelf, and then you light all four candles in

4688
05:10:05,660 --> 05:10:11,260
the room. And then there'll be a powder keg that you can light here just on the outskirts of that room.

4689
05:10:11,900 --> 05:10:17,740
It will blow a hole in the wall, but you need to light it and then leave the room. So it blows up.

4690
05:10:18,700 --> 05:10:21,100
And then that's you.

4691
05:10:23,580 --> 05:10:29,020
Or that door. I mean, you're not wrong. I don't know if it blows up if you go out on that door,

4692
05:10:29,020 --> 05:10:35,660
but the other door. Or did it blow up? Boom. Okay, there you go. I blew up. I think that's

4693
05:10:35,660 --> 05:10:42,140
all the reeflings. I don't see anyone else hiding in that room. Can you come over? Yeah! Okay,

4694
05:10:42,220 --> 05:10:49,260
reeflings. Let's go next. Let's go next. We're doing it. Oh, if you click here on the foot,

4695
05:10:50,780 --> 05:10:56,060
on the mini map up here, it'll put running on. So if it's brown, it means you're walking. If it's

4696
05:10:56,060 --> 05:11:02,620
golden, it means you're running. Your stamina will regain eventually. So don't worry. Oh,

4697
05:11:02,620 --> 05:11:07,100
suspiciously. Let's observe this suspicious tree over here.

4698
05:11:07,100 --> 05:11:14,220
Please stop this. Just let me go. Oh, it's kind of messed up. We're going to play a game. Do you

4699
05:11:14,220 --> 05:11:21,500
like to play games? Yeah, no. Yes, whatever you say, just then it hurt me. Whether you get hurt

4700
05:11:21,500 --> 05:11:26,140
or not is entirely up to you. Your fate is in your own hands. What? What do you mean?

4701
05:11:27,260 --> 05:11:34,060
Leave her alone, you monster. Ah, Scottlefish. How kind of you to join us. Now, if you say another

4702
05:11:34,060 --> 05:11:40,620
word, I will end her right now. Sorry, where were we? Ah yes, of course, the game. Do you like

4703
05:11:40,620 --> 05:11:52,060
quests, Lissy? Uh, sure, I like quests. Do you like scary quests? Uh-huh. What's your favorite

4704
05:11:52,060 --> 05:12:01,020
scary quest? I don't know. You have to have a favorite. Uh, the one with a vampire in it who

4705
05:12:01,020 --> 05:12:07,820
lives in the big house. Good, good. And now for that game I spoke about. I am going to ask you

4706
05:12:07,820 --> 05:12:13,580
one question. Get it wrong and you die, but get it right and you live. How is that fair? Oh,

4707
05:12:13,580 --> 05:12:19,740
gothicks. Please, gothicks? Isn't that a type of armor? Oh, gothicks, please, no, please,

4708
05:12:19,740 --> 05:12:25,740
don't. I don't want to die. Then think hard about your answer. You like vampires, so this should

4709
05:12:25,740 --> 05:12:35,340
be easy for you. The question is, who is the vampire that resides in South Mish? I would be

4710
05:12:35,340 --> 05:12:43,900
perishing. Um, I'm to say nothing. I'm not, I'm not to say anything. He said he's gonna slash her

4711
05:12:43,900 --> 05:12:50,940
if I say anything. Oh yes, yes, I know it. Count Draenor. Ha, in your face, you masked freak.

4712
05:12:51,660 --> 05:12:58,380
Oh, Lacy, Lacy, Lacy, I did tell you to think hard about your answer. Count Draenor is in fact a

4713
05:12:58,380 --> 05:13:09,340
vampire and he does reside in his manor in Mithilith, but that manor is in West Mithilith. I was

4714
05:13:09,340 --> 05:13:16,220
talking about Count Chek. Thanks for playing. No, no, you tricked me. This isn't fair. Ask me another.

4715
05:13:16,220 --> 05:13:29,020
Gargle, gargle, gargle, gargle. The writing in this game is, I think it's because I have,

4716
05:13:29,020 --> 05:13:36,540
oh, he's leaving his notes? Okay, I'll take the note. Do you like jazz? Take the note, please.

4717
05:13:37,260 --> 05:13:41,740
That monster, oh, I can't do that because I actually only clicked on the note. Oopsies, take note.

4718
05:13:42,700 --> 05:13:49,980
You take the note, what does it say? It's like music to my ears, the glory sounds spelling out your

4719
05:13:49,980 --> 05:13:58,460
fate. Oh, okay, get into the, once you pick up the note, there's a piano. Where to do something with

4720
05:13:58,460 --> 05:14:07,500
it? Someone is throwing Easter eggs everywhere. Play piano. Okay, once you're on the piano,

4721
05:14:08,060 --> 05:14:23,100
delta, echo, alpha, delta. Did we do it right? Oh, there's a compartment. Can I play for real?

4722
05:14:25,260 --> 05:14:27,260
Oh, you can't. You can't play this one.

4723
05:14:27,260 --> 05:14:37,660
You can't play this one. You can't play this one. Oh, I think my inventory is full, hold on.

4724
05:14:37,660 --> 05:14:39,420
I think there's something I'm supposed to grab.

4725
05:14:42,140 --> 05:14:50,300
Play piano, search piano, search piano. Oh, once you play that, delta is just, I don't see a delta

4726
05:14:50,380 --> 05:14:56,940
button. Oh, very funny, very funny. Oh, it spells out dead. Do you like metal? Does baby metal

4727
05:14:56,940 --> 05:15:10,060
count as metal? I like OST from Doom. Doom? Yeah, Doom 2007, BFG is probably my favorite,

4728
05:15:10,060 --> 05:15:15,180
if that counts as metal song. Has everyone got the key? If you got the key, come up the hallway a

4729
05:15:15,180 --> 05:15:19,580
little bit. Oh wait, we're, oh no, we're supposed to go back. Okay, if you've got the key, come out

4730
05:15:19,580 --> 05:15:27,580
of the room. Let's see if there's any, who's not got the key? Got the key, got the key.

4731
05:15:30,620 --> 05:15:34,140
Someone's, I don't know if someone's in that cutscene with the guy.

4732
05:15:36,300 --> 05:15:44,460
Spelled dead on the piano from the left side. Is that Hatsune Miku? It's Hatsune Miku. Hello guys,

4733
05:15:45,020 --> 05:15:52,380
my name is Hatsune Miku. I'm thinking Miku, Miku. There's a refling here, but I don't know if

4734
05:15:52,380 --> 05:16:04,700
they're in a cutscene or not, I'm not sure. I don't know what's happening with this refling,

4735
05:16:04,700 --> 05:16:12,940
I think they might be AFK, but everyone, oh, I don't know. Miku, you're, Miku, you're mine.

4736
05:16:15,660 --> 05:16:22,220
I think so. Okay, I think so, you're hanging out with us. I don't know, oh, oh, did you get the key?

4737
05:16:24,300 --> 05:16:29,500
Do you need to do the piano bit? I don't know. Oh right, spell dead on the piano and then search

4738
05:16:29,500 --> 05:16:32,940
the piano. And left side spell dead, if that makes sense.

4739
05:16:36,300 --> 05:16:41,980
Damn, there's no cheer remote. There is in game. Wait, where is it? Cheer, cheer. Okay,

4740
05:16:41,980 --> 05:16:48,300
that's the best I got. Sorry, I was AFK, I'll catch up. Yeah, just spell, yeah, yeah, there you go,

4741
05:16:48,300 --> 05:16:55,500
you got it, you got the key. If you touch the piano and then on left spell side and then you

4742
05:16:55,500 --> 05:17:02,540
should get key. I think everyone's got the key. Yippee, everyone's got the key, right, let's go.

4743
05:17:02,540 --> 05:17:05,980
Come back inside the house from the side, we blew it up on the powder keg.

4744
05:17:07,100 --> 05:17:10,780
Oh, it's a room full of reflings. Oh no, just me in a room full of reflings.

4745
05:17:13,340 --> 05:17:17,020
Okay, come back into the entrance hallway. Oh, we're getting stuck on the door.

4746
05:17:17,900 --> 05:17:26,220
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh, right, hold on. You again! It's him, it's him that's doing it.

4747
05:17:27,260 --> 05:17:31,500
It's him that's doing it, I'm getting freaking stuck. Wait, how'd that come around?

4748
05:17:32,620 --> 05:17:39,980
I literally can't progress. Stop it, I can't even get through. Or is it one by one? Oh,

4749
05:17:39,980 --> 05:17:43,980
maybe a one by one, hold on. I might be accusing someone of closing the door and I think it's one

4750
05:17:43,980 --> 05:17:49,900
by one. Oh, right, oh, sorry, sorry, I just, I'm sorry, refling. Miss input, miss input!

4751
05:17:51,500 --> 05:17:58,780
Oh, it's a miss input, okay. Shawnee letting her imagination run wild. Honestly, honestly?

4752
05:18:00,140 --> 05:18:03,340
Okay, so one by one door, take your time, take your time, it's one by one door.

4753
05:18:04,300 --> 05:18:07,820
Right, here we come. Stop, refling! Let us come in.

4754
05:18:13,260 --> 05:18:17,260
Everyone's got a better ping than me! Okay, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

4755
05:18:20,540 --> 05:18:27,020
Okay, then through the other one by one door. Oh, it's a cutscene. Accusing her own

4756
05:18:27,580 --> 05:18:32,220
beloved loyal refling. Why am I the only one always left cleaning up after everyone?

4757
05:18:33,100 --> 05:18:41,900
Shuffle? Hello, anyone there? Russell? Hello, Lacey said. Scratch.

4758
05:18:43,580 --> 05:18:51,260
Hmm, well I guess I should go check it out. No point saying in this nice locked room when I could

4759
05:18:51,260 --> 05:18:57,580
go outside into the creepy darkness. Seriously? The walls and doors seem too thick for Mandy to

4760
05:18:57,580 --> 05:19:03,340
be able to hear you. Oh, and I don't think there is any need to take this big shiny

4761
05:19:03,340 --> 05:19:09,020
weapon with me in order to defend myself. Nothing bad ever happens when people go check out noises

4762
05:19:09,020 --> 05:19:16,300
in the dark outside the house. You have gotta be kidding. Okay, well here I go.

4763
05:19:16,700 --> 05:19:23,820
Bando Scotsword. Hello, anyone out here?

4764
05:19:26,780 --> 05:19:30,940
See, I knew nothing would happen. Must have just been a squirrel or something running about.

4765
05:19:36,220 --> 05:19:39,660
Oh well, back to the dishes. Phew, that was lucky.

4766
05:19:40,540 --> 05:19:44,060
Oh, he's behind you!

4767
05:19:47,180 --> 05:19:53,420
No, why me? That psycho. He was just toying with her.

4768
05:19:55,340 --> 05:20:00,620
Oh, we're getting left another note, I think. Is this talk to killer? Just look at what we can.

4769
05:20:00,620 --> 05:20:06,780
We're in a cutscene. And he's hiding away again. Another note, this guy really likes playing games,

4770
05:20:06,780 --> 05:20:13,500
but this is going to be the game he won't win. Okay, there should be a note on the ground for us

4771
05:20:13,500 --> 05:20:22,700
to read now. Here, at first, these words. Each murder you witness helplessly from start to end

4772
05:20:22,700 --> 05:20:28,860
as you fail to solve the final letters of this quiz. Razor sharp like a gemstone is the blade of my

4773
05:20:28,860 --> 05:20:36,620
knife. The last sound you hear will be your screams echo. Hita, I will have the final word

4774
05:20:36,700 --> 05:20:48,780
in this thriller. Okay, we need to go back into the hallway on the one-by-one door, so we need to be patient.

4775
05:20:48,780 --> 05:21:04,140
I'm standing and lying. I was looking in soft lock by a door. Okay, there we go, I made it through.

4776
05:21:06,060 --> 05:21:13,900
Wait, what was that? Oh, that makes sense. Is there a refland just out there chilling?

4777
05:21:13,900 --> 05:21:17,100
Are you not doing the quiz? Are you just bing-chilling out there? Bing-chilling.

4778
05:21:19,740 --> 05:21:20,940
Are you not sure what to do?

4779
05:21:24,380 --> 05:21:27,740
Okay, and then one-by-one, we painfully go through this door again.

4780
05:21:29,500 --> 05:21:36,300
Now we're getting waving hello, hello. Okay, we need to check out the fireplace. Okay, or also known as the heart.

4781
05:21:36,300 --> 05:21:42,220
Oh wait, this is chopped on tree. Examine the fireplace with a knife. Use the knife on the fireplace.

4782
05:21:43,660 --> 05:21:47,980
You use the knife to pry open a loose brick in the fireplace, revealing a secret panel

4783
05:21:49,500 --> 05:21:55,180
Search fireplace. You find a panel of switches inside the hidden compartment.

4784
05:21:55,180 --> 05:21:58,060
Each switch is crafted from a different gemstone.

4785
05:21:58,620 --> 05:22:21,580
Click sapphire. Click diamonds. Click zanyate. Click emerald. Click on it. Then click ruby.

4786
05:22:22,300 --> 05:22:26,300
Blue, white, orange, green, black, red.

4787
05:22:28,220 --> 05:22:32,700
You hear a click sound. You find a hidden key. Okay, that one's a bit more.

4788
05:22:34,620 --> 05:22:42,220
SD, Z, E, autumn. How are you supposed to figure that out? I love riddles in this game.

4789
05:22:42,220 --> 05:22:48,140
Must have been the wind. Would you be upset if it was ink you were cleaning instead?

4790
05:22:49,100 --> 05:22:51,980
Oh man, I can't believe this. I can't find my old character anymore.

4791
05:22:51,980 --> 05:22:58,940
I wanted to bring in a high-level character to help out. I don't worry. Also, there's a boss fight now.

4792
05:23:01,180 --> 05:23:05,900
I don't have any combat. The final letters of the note.

4793
05:23:05,900 --> 05:23:18,540
Oh, I have the final word in this form.

4794
05:23:21,100 --> 05:23:27,660
Okay, okay, that's actually wee bit smart. I'll give it a wee bit smart.

4795
05:23:27,660 --> 05:23:32,460
Just a wee bit. One by one door. One by one door.

4796
05:23:32,460 --> 05:23:37,100
One by one door. One by one. Cheeky one by one. Oh wait, is everyone done with the hearth?

4797
05:23:37,100 --> 05:23:38,620
God, you guys were so quick at the hearth.

4798
05:23:41,340 --> 05:23:45,180
Okay, Cheeky. Cheeky one by one door. That's it. Let me in.

4799
05:23:45,180 --> 05:23:48,940
Stop! You don't even need to come in this room. You've already done the quest.

4800
05:23:48,940 --> 05:23:54,700
Bruv, I don't have high enough ping. I can't get out. I actually don't have high enough ping

4801
05:23:54,700 --> 05:24:01,500
to get out. I'm not even being funny. My ping is so bad. I can't get out. Bruv.

4802
05:24:03,420 --> 05:24:07,900
I don't know what to do. My ping isn't fast enough to respond.

4803
05:24:10,140 --> 05:24:14,860
The background keeps reminding me of the godfather. I've never seen the godfather. Is it gay?

4804
05:24:16,540 --> 05:24:23,900
Fail to solve the final letters of this quiz. Fail to solve the- Ah, okay, okay. Oh, okay, it works.

4805
05:24:24,460 --> 05:24:27,500
Okay. Alright, in you go.

4806
05:24:27,980 --> 05:24:32,380
Right, once we're back in the engine's way, we one by one on the door over here.

4807
05:24:33,020 --> 05:24:34,220
We're spinning on the door.

4808
05:24:38,060 --> 05:24:42,140
Let's refling. Here we go. And then we go. Boom.

4809
05:24:45,740 --> 05:24:51,260
We got a cutscene. I wonder if there's a way to make the text bigger.

4810
05:24:51,260 --> 05:24:52,540
Show yourself, you coward.

4811
05:24:53,260 --> 05:24:56,220
Monkey. Monkey, is someone gonna get stuff?

4812
05:25:00,300 --> 05:25:04,460
So, we meet at last. I have to say, I'm impressed you worked out my riddles. Well,

4813
05:25:04,460 --> 05:25:09,340
maybe you aren't as smart as you think you are. Or really, all the dead bodies suggest otherwise.

4814
05:25:09,900 --> 05:25:16,620
And what did you do to stop them? Nothing. People think you are some big hero, but no,

4815
05:25:16,620 --> 05:25:22,140
you're not. All your adventures are the same. Nothing but opportunists. What are you on about?

4816
05:25:22,140 --> 05:25:25,820
Well, I did have this big speech planned out, but quite frankly,

4817
05:25:25,820 --> 05:25:28,460
I don't think you're worth the effort it would take to deliver it.

4818
05:25:29,420 --> 05:25:33,340
So, this is the end of the line for you. It is time for the final act.

4819
05:25:33,340 --> 05:25:37,740
The showdown. The finale. Let's see if you're up for the challenge.

4820
05:25:41,500 --> 05:25:48,140
Probably not. I'm too- Ah, if I die, do I lose all the money that's on my hand? Push mirror.

4821
05:25:53,100 --> 05:25:56,300
The mirror can't be pushed any further. What are you on about?

4822
05:25:59,100 --> 05:26:03,500
Oh no, I missed. Wait, is there like a timer?

4823
05:26:05,900 --> 05:26:12,780
Hello? Oh. Logic puzzle? Wait, do I need to like-

4824
05:26:12,780 --> 05:26:18,380
Do it all the time? Wait, hold on. Push. And then push. And then push from here.

4825
05:26:18,380 --> 05:26:26,780
Boom. Oh, what? He changed. I don't know which one he's coming from.

4826
05:26:29,820 --> 05:26:30,860
Did I just have to guess?

4827
05:26:33,900 --> 05:26:36,620
Oh, for goodness- Wait, I can't see when it's coming.

4828
05:26:39,900 --> 05:26:45,500
Is it that one? I think I'm too. Like, can you just randomize to this one where I've already

4829
05:26:45,500 --> 05:26:52,380
said it all? Please, that'd be great game. Wait, I'm supposed to run about that fast?

4830
05:26:53,180 --> 05:26:57,820
I don't think I'm that fast. I'm fricking too late.

4831
05:26:59,900 --> 05:27:04,860
And- Oh, right. Okay, there's like a weird shadow thing, but I don't know if I'm that fast.

4832
05:27:04,860 --> 05:27:09,100
Seriously. I'm not that fast! Oh.

4833
05:27:09,980 --> 05:27:25,180
Bruv. Did I just need to camp at one? He's too fast! Oh my god, he's like so fast!

4834
05:27:27,820 --> 05:27:33,980
Hold on. Oh, please be it. Oh no!

4835
05:27:34,940 --> 05:27:44,060
Oh, right, okay. Wait, I don't even know where it's coming from. Oh, right, okay. Shadow, shadow.

4836
05:27:45,100 --> 05:27:48,380
Okay, he's doing it again from that one. Okay, okay. Quick, quick, quick!

4837
05:27:51,340 --> 05:27:56,700
Is it- Oh, shit, I'm too- Please be this one. No!

4838
05:27:57,980 --> 05:28:02,220
The randomizer is so cruel. You know for a fact you can randomize elsewhere.

4839
05:28:03,180 --> 05:28:09,740
Okay, another one, another one. Oh, dang right out. All right, okay, okay, okay,

4840
05:28:09,740 --> 05:28:19,660
we can do this, we can do this. One, two, and three. Oh, just in time. Oh, we did it.

4841
05:28:24,220 --> 05:28:27,740
I flopped out. Oh, I think I may have underestimated you.

4842
05:28:28,540 --> 05:28:36,140
You lost at your own game and now it is time to see who you really are under that mask.

4843
05:28:39,420 --> 05:28:44,620
Wait, no, you, but why? Why on earth would you kill all your pals? Why beg me to come here and help

4844
05:28:44,620 --> 05:28:52,540
them? You just don't get it, do you? So big-headed, so used to it all being about you, about saving the

4845
05:28:52,540 --> 05:28:58,220
day. Well, I'm sick of it. What do you even mean? Adventurers, you're all the same. Everything

4846
05:28:58,220 --> 05:29:03,260
always has to be about you. I don't understand. Of course you wouldn't, because you can't see

4847
05:29:03,260 --> 05:29:11,420
past yourself. Believe it or not, I used to be like- Okay, at least to be like you, I hear about

4848
05:29:11,420 --> 05:29:18,860
some dance alone distress and go to help. Have my moment for me to be the hero for once. But you,

4849
05:29:18,940 --> 05:29:23,420
you and every other adventurer, every time I get there to help is too late.

4850
05:29:23,420 --> 05:29:29,260
It's already solved. The disaster is averted. Reward has already been claimed. Every time you

4851
05:29:29,260 --> 05:29:35,980
and those adventurers steal my moment, but not this time. This time, it's all about me. I'm the

4852
05:29:35,980 --> 05:29:43,180
star of the show. Me, me, me, me, me. Well, not any longer. The show's over and there will be no

4853
05:29:43,180 --> 05:29:48,300
curtain call. Oh, but there's always a curtain call. He he he he.

4854
05:29:52,540 --> 05:29:54,300
What? How? There was two?

4855
05:29:57,980 --> 05:30:02,300
Of course. Every good show needs a good support and actor. Now take off your mask, darling. Take

4856
05:30:02,300 --> 05:30:09,260
a bow. You've earned it. Of course, my love. It's Sid! No, it's not. It's Harvey. I'm sorry.

4857
05:30:10,140 --> 05:30:14,220
You, but how? You were almost heckin' gone. I saw your wounds.

4858
05:30:15,580 --> 05:30:22,060
No, what you watched was what I wanted you to watch. A masterful performance, if I say so myself.

4859
05:30:22,060 --> 05:30:26,940
But what's in it for you? Everyone loves the limelight and who better to share it with

4860
05:30:26,940 --> 05:30:32,700
them, my beloved Abigail. But your friends? They didn't deserve to perish.

4861
05:30:34,060 --> 05:30:38,860
Perhaps not, but neither did I deserve to be cast back into the shadows where I deserve the

4862
05:30:38,860 --> 05:30:47,580
spotlight. Yes, well, we deserve the spotlight. And now I have my starring role, our starring role.

4863
05:30:48,540 --> 05:30:51,660
Gelinor will forever remember this night and what I've done here.

4864
05:30:54,140 --> 05:31:05,340
No, what we have done. Quiet Huey, this is my moment. No, this is supposed to be our moment.

4865
05:31:06,300 --> 05:31:09,660
It isn't just all about you either. We're in this together.

4866
05:31:10,460 --> 05:31:15,580
Stop ruining this, Huey. I have worked so hard for this and I'm not gonna let you take it away from

4867
05:31:15,580 --> 05:31:22,860
me. Well, I'm not gonna be push aside either. We were both in on this as equals. We were never

4868
05:31:22,860 --> 05:31:30,860
equals. How could you possibly compare to me? You're egotistical, selfish. No, my love.

4869
05:31:31,100 --> 05:31:41,820
No, what have I done? It wasn't supposed to be like this, but you just couldn't let me have my

4870
05:31:41,820 --> 05:31:50,540
moment. Why, Huey, why? I loved you. This could be my chance to take advantage of the situation.

4871
05:31:51,660 --> 05:31:57,900
Okay, pick up the knife. I'm not going out of her empty-handed. Yeah, pick up, take the killer's knife.

4872
05:31:58,460 --> 05:32:04,860
Yonk and I'm not go- wait, equip the knife, pick up the knife and equip it and then stab her.

4873
05:32:05,820 --> 05:32:13,180
Take that, hack and slash. Well, thanks Sarah Domen. That's over. I should get out of here.

4874
05:32:15,260 --> 05:32:22,060
Just like that. Are they still alive? I don't think he's in a very talkative mood. Are they both?

4875
05:32:22,060 --> 05:32:25,740
Okay. Okay, let's get out of here. Let's get out. Let's get out.

4876
05:32:28,220 --> 05:32:32,540
The crying says, you'll never escape me.

4877
05:32:34,940 --> 05:32:43,340
You dare try and ruin- wait, what? NPC spot? Isn't she supposed to be parish? Try and ruin my moment.

4878
05:32:43,340 --> 05:32:51,260
Oh, wait, no. Huey is hurt because of you. It's definitely to you. Oh, wait. Now it's time for

4879
05:32:51,260 --> 05:32:56,700
you to join. Oh, you're not killing anyone else. Oh, again, absolutely. She's spanked by the-

4880
05:32:59,580 --> 05:33:03,580
No, this can't be. She just got specked. Whoa, that was close.

4881
05:33:04,780 --> 05:33:10,300
Mandy, how are you alive? I watched you get shanked. I did get stabbed, but I was born with a rare

4882
05:33:10,300 --> 05:33:19,500
condition called Dextrocardia. Dextrocardia what? Dextrocardia. It means that my heart is on the

4883
05:33:19,500 --> 05:33:24,460
right side of my chest, not my left. Oh, that's so specific. So when the killers thought they stabbed

4884
05:33:24,460 --> 05:33:29,660
you in the heart, they actually missed? Well, missed the heart, yeah. I did still get stabbed,

4885
05:33:29,660 --> 05:33:35,900
though. I'm actually feeling pretty woozy. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. I will wait outside the house

4886
05:33:35,900 --> 05:33:40,940
after seeing to this stab wound. You should come talk to me there. Okay, okay, okay.

4887
05:33:41,660 --> 05:33:49,260
Hey, right, outside the house if my- Oh, no, are you guys stuck on the mirror section?

4888
05:33:51,100 --> 05:33:54,620
Are they stuck on the mirror section if they're still in here? Or are they just in the cutscene?

4889
05:33:56,860 --> 05:34:00,540
Someone throw in their snowball. I'm starting to think you aren't throwing snowballs anymore.

4890
05:34:00,540 --> 05:34:04,700
No witnesses, the roofling's never taught. My medieval fantasy game with medieval-

4891
05:34:04,700 --> 05:34:10,380
Oh, my medieval fantasy game with medical term. There's still one more roofling stuck in there.

4892
05:34:11,900 --> 05:34:17,020
Are you stuck on the mirror quest, beyond it? I'm on team finish faster than throwing it. I need to

4893
05:34:17,020 --> 05:34:30,620
read it out. I don't think these are snowballs I'm getting covered in or something. Should I have

4894
05:34:30,620 --> 05:34:37,260
fought Abigail? You pick up a knife. Oh, did you just leave? You might have to go back inside

4895
05:34:37,260 --> 05:34:41,100
and redo that mirror section sadly. Whoa, wait, it's okay.

4896
05:34:45,260 --> 05:34:50,620
I mean, did you shank her? All right. Oh, the roofling's out. Is that everyone?

4897
05:34:51,980 --> 05:34:58,220
All the candles floor, all aboard. Oh, we're talking about humors and bail there.

4898
05:35:00,620 --> 05:35:03,820
Okay, that's all the rooflings. Everyone into the entrance way.

4899
05:35:04,620 --> 05:35:10,300
Turns out you can't fight her. Nah, you don't actually hurt Abigail yourself.

4900
05:35:11,740 --> 05:35:15,900
Right, and then we talk. Oh, no, it's one by one door. Oh, it's our biggest enemy. It's

4901
05:35:15,900 --> 05:35:23,500
literally our biggest enemy right now, one by one door. The game's like sending me away.

4902
05:35:24,140 --> 05:35:30,140
Right, I'll wait for the rooflings to go first. I'll let the rooflings go because they've been

4903
05:35:30,620 --> 05:35:36,620
playing with me without having a go time. No witnesses, the rooflings will never talk.

4904
05:35:37,180 --> 05:35:42,780
Fair and square. The actual end boss of the game. I don't think there's snowballs either,

4905
05:35:42,780 --> 05:35:50,620
but they may contain some terms in common. All done. Okay, we need to talk to the

4906
05:35:50,620 --> 05:35:55,900
Mandy right here. Oh, hi, Scottlefish. Hi, Mandy. How are you feeling now? Much better.

4907
05:35:55,900 --> 05:36:00,460
Thanks and lucky to be alive. Thanks to you. No small part. Well, we saved the day in the

4908
05:36:00,460 --> 05:36:05,260
team, so thank you too. Here, I found this in the wardrobe. I don't want to take it,

4909
05:36:05,260 --> 05:36:13,740
so please take it. We did it! We got another quest for level eight crafting and we got rubies for

4910
05:36:13,740 --> 05:36:22,380
it. I like that. Well, I think we're ready to go back. Is everyone ready once you've collected

4911
05:36:22,380 --> 05:36:30,380
your mission? The question is, what quest do we do now? We'll do the free quests.

4912
05:36:32,380 --> 05:36:35,660
I'm level nine crafting. I went, oh yeah, you're just rubbing in my face.

4913
05:36:38,300 --> 05:36:42,700
Looks like everyone's spoken to Mandy, almost. A few more wheat funds.

4914
05:36:45,740 --> 05:36:51,500
Someone's really enjoying just talking to all the wood. Is that everyone? I'm just trying to check.

4915
05:36:52,700 --> 05:37:00,700
Are you coming too? No? Yeah, no, maybe. Right, all aboard the boat.

4916
05:37:04,060 --> 05:37:08,860
Who do I talk to to finish the quest? Mandy, she's outside that castle.

4917
05:37:10,220 --> 05:37:14,540
Yeah, we did it! We did it! Wait, wait, let me do a celebration of moat. Can I jump in the air?

4918
05:37:15,500 --> 05:37:16,700
We completed the quest!

4919
05:37:25,180 --> 05:37:32,140
Okay, I think we should go to the bank

4920
05:37:33,500 --> 05:37:38,060
and put all our items away and then we'll pick what quest to do next. What's a free quest?

4921
05:37:38,060 --> 05:37:43,580
That's easy. Goblin Diplomacy is pretty easy.

4922
05:37:43,580 --> 05:37:49,260
Erin is the chicken. I think you need to have combat. I think you need combat for Erin.

4923
05:37:49,980 --> 05:37:52,140
Sleep well, good night, those who have to go.

4924
05:37:55,100 --> 05:38:01,100
Good night, Trony. We'll see you there, Bessa. Until later, I don't know if there's anything easy.

4925
05:38:01,100 --> 05:38:03,740
Erin is the chicken. It's probably the easiest we've got right now.

4926
05:38:04,700 --> 05:38:09,820
I think we need to level up, so that's not only why we need to level up.

4927
05:38:10,860 --> 05:38:12,220
Just a runaway segment.

4928
05:38:14,700 --> 05:38:16,620
All kind. It's all the refunds here.

4929
05:38:23,100 --> 05:38:25,180
Yeah, I've got some stuff to do. Try not to get food.

4930
05:38:25,180 --> 05:38:28,700
For those who have to go, don't worry if you have to go. Understand, it's not possible.

4931
05:38:28,700 --> 05:38:33,020
We'll do Erin is the chicken and then we're going to go back to fishing.

4932
05:38:33,100 --> 05:38:35,260
Sorry, we're going to go back to leveling up cooking.

4933
05:38:38,860 --> 05:38:40,940
Okay, is everyone here? I think everyone's here.

4934
05:38:42,140 --> 05:38:44,700
I don't know if that other refling is still stuck on the island.

4935
05:38:45,900 --> 05:38:50,620
Possibly. That went crazy. Didn't we just see him back on this island?

4936
05:38:52,940 --> 05:38:55,420
Wait, there is a refling that got stuck on that quest? I think.

4937
05:38:56,380 --> 05:38:57,500
It's called scrawny sea.

4938
05:38:59,980 --> 05:39:03,500
Oh no, that was a good thing. Okay, see you later. Bye bye refling.

4939
05:39:03,500 --> 05:39:07,020
Thank you for joining for the ones who have to leave. Don't worry if you have to leave in game.

4940
05:39:07,580 --> 05:39:11,820
Right, if you want to follow me, if you hover on me, it should say follow.

4941
05:39:13,100 --> 05:39:16,940
And then I'll take you to the bank and then we'll do Erin is the chicken.

4942
05:39:16,940 --> 05:39:18,700
I don't know what is, but we'll do it anyway.

4943
05:39:19,500 --> 05:39:21,660
Oh, I'll walk. Sorry, I'll walk. I always forget to walk.

4944
05:39:22,860 --> 05:39:24,540
We've got a refling army, honestly.

4945
05:39:25,980 --> 05:39:30,940
See you later alligator in a wild crocodile.

4946
05:39:32,380 --> 05:39:35,900
Yeah, I want to, I want to go to the island.

4947
05:39:36,940 --> 05:39:41,100
Why would you let me go? Did you guys see that Stephen Hawking meme?

4948
05:39:41,100 --> 05:39:46,380
That sounds really terrible, but that's what the meme was.

4949
05:39:47,740 --> 05:39:50,780
So when it came out that Stephen Hawking went on the island,

4950
05:39:50,780 --> 05:39:54,140
someone like did a quote and it was like, I want to go to the island.

4951
05:39:54,140 --> 05:39:55,180
Why won't you let me go?

4952
05:40:00,140 --> 05:40:01,500
Oh, I just love the brave word.

4953
05:40:02,300 --> 05:40:05,580
I know the stream isn't over yet, but when do you think the next runescape won?

4954
05:40:05,580 --> 05:40:07,500
Probably in a week's time.

4955
05:40:08,220 --> 05:40:11,500
My endurance stream is Skyrim for next week,

4956
05:40:12,300 --> 05:40:15,660
but I am going to try and get 99th cooking.

4957
05:40:15,660 --> 05:40:16,700
Where am I trying to go?

4958
05:40:16,700 --> 05:40:19,180
I don't know why I need the map to go to the bank and all the bankers.

4959
05:40:19,820 --> 05:40:23,260
My next, I'm going to try and finish 99 cooking.

4960
05:40:24,140 --> 05:40:30,220
In one month, I want to finish 99 cooking.

4961
05:40:31,500 --> 05:40:32,940
Bobby Lee or whatever.

4962
05:40:32,940 --> 05:40:34,060
Yeah, yeah, that was it.

4963
05:40:35,100 --> 05:40:39,260
No, it's just going to be vanilla Skyrim for my endurance stream next week.

4964
05:40:39,260 --> 05:40:42,140
Endurance stream next week is Skyrim and Runescape.

4965
05:40:43,260 --> 05:40:46,140
I don't think today we're going to do the full 12 hours

4966
05:40:46,140 --> 05:40:48,220
because I've actually done quite a lot of 12 hours.

4967
05:40:48,220 --> 05:40:50,060
Go upstairs on the top of the bank.

4968
05:40:50,060 --> 05:40:51,260
How are you everywhere?

4969
05:40:51,260 --> 05:40:53,500
Am I going crazy or is this a bot?

4970
05:40:53,500 --> 05:40:56,140
Or is this a leafling that like is just no,

4971
05:40:56,140 --> 05:40:58,460
like how are you leveling up outside here?

4972
05:40:58,460 --> 05:40:59,740
What we didn't even get here.

4973
05:41:00,620 --> 05:41:01,420
I'm going crazy.

4974
05:41:01,420 --> 05:41:02,540
I swear that's a leafling.

4975
05:41:03,260 --> 05:41:03,740
Right.

4976
05:41:03,740 --> 05:41:05,740
Empty everything inside.

4977
05:41:06,780 --> 05:41:10,700
I guess you can just drop the notes from that minigame.

4978
05:41:14,060 --> 05:41:15,340
And then Erin is the chicken.

4979
05:41:15,340 --> 05:41:18,460
I'm actually going to equip my sword and shield.

4980
05:41:18,460 --> 05:41:21,180
I'm pretty sure I got unequipped for some reason

4981
05:41:21,180 --> 05:41:23,180
and I don't want to be completely defenseless.

4982
05:41:23,980 --> 05:41:24,780
I'm not out there.

4983
05:41:24,780 --> 05:41:27,100
I think we just draw destroy you, I guess.

4984
05:41:31,900 --> 05:41:34,940
Wait, am I not allowed to destroy the notes?

4985
05:41:35,660 --> 05:41:37,100
They'll just put them in the bank then.

4986
05:41:37,980 --> 05:41:39,340
Okay, I'm just putting the notes in the bank.

4987
05:41:39,340 --> 05:41:39,980
I don't know why.

4988
05:41:40,620 --> 05:41:41,340
No, that's me.

4989
05:41:41,340 --> 05:41:41,820
All right.

4990
05:41:41,820 --> 05:41:42,700
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4991
05:41:44,300 --> 05:41:45,500
I can just what I was like,

4992
05:41:45,500 --> 05:41:47,660
I'm sure that's a leafling genuinely.

4993
05:41:47,660 --> 05:41:50,060
Anyone want my three gems since I can't bank them?

4994
05:41:50,060 --> 05:41:51,580
Oh, me, me, me, me, me, me.

4995
05:41:51,660 --> 05:41:53,500
Send them to Mommy who said that.

4996
05:41:54,300 --> 05:41:55,420
Me, me, me, me, me, head a...

4997
05:41:55,420 --> 05:41:56,300
Ah, I can't trade you.

4998
05:41:56,300 --> 05:41:56,940
What?

4999
05:41:56,940 --> 05:41:58,060
Oh, I've only traded you?

5000
05:41:59,900 --> 05:42:02,060
Oh, well, at least you can send it to me at least.

5001
05:42:02,060 --> 05:42:04,380
Yeah, I dunno why I wouldn't want me to do that.

5002
05:42:04,380 --> 05:42:06,060
Me, me, me, me, me.

5003
05:42:06,060 --> 05:42:07,180
Oh, my god, my, my, my, my, no.

5004
05:42:09,580 --> 05:42:13,340
We should fight the level 152 chicken at the gate, ill.

5005
05:42:13,340 --> 05:42:13,980
Is that true?

5006
05:42:13,980 --> 05:42:14,620
Is that real?

5007
05:42:15,260 --> 05:42:16,220
I don't mean to alarm you,

5008
05:42:16,220 --> 05:42:17,740
but NaNNa and Cookin make take...

5009
05:42:17,740 --> 05:42:20,300
Someone said it can take 30 hours if we max it.

5010
05:42:21,580 --> 05:42:26,260
I can't trade for another 52 minutes, that's okay.

5011
05:42:26,260 --> 05:42:34,900
Err, right, erm, Ern is the chicken, we're gonna do Big Ernie the checkin' buck buck

5012
05:42:34,900 --> 05:42:37,180
er, show on the map.

5013
05:42:37,180 --> 05:42:43,180
We need to go, oooh, outside this location here.

5014
05:42:43,180 --> 05:42:44,660
I don't know, do we level up?

5015
05:42:44,660 --> 05:42:47,660
I feel like we need to do a bit of combat.

5016
05:42:48,620 --> 05:42:55,420
Well we go kill cows for like, I'm not even kidding, we'll go, er, kill cows for like,

5017
05:42:55,420 --> 05:42:56,420
five minutes.

5018
05:42:56,420 --> 05:42:59,980
So we're gonna go across the bridge and get cows.

5019
05:42:59,980 --> 05:43:04,460
Reeflings, come down to the castle, I'll wait for you at the front of the castle.

5020
05:43:04,460 --> 05:43:09,020
Make sure you have a sword and a shield equipped, did you got it from Tutorial Island.

5021
05:43:09,020 --> 05:43:13,460
A hundred hours are five strong streams of frogs in the lake!

5022
05:43:13,460 --> 05:43:14,460
Honestly.

5023
05:43:17,900 --> 05:43:25,500
Yeah, we go, right, we will just go outside the castello, er, and I'll make sure everyone,

5024
05:43:25,500 --> 05:43:29,460
I don't see anyone coming down the stairs from there, I think there's no one.

5025
05:43:29,460 --> 05:43:34,140
Everyone's on, you guys are quick, I don't think there's anyone, I don't see anyone.

5026
05:43:34,140 --> 05:43:40,500
Okay, we're gonna cross the bridge, five streams must be short ones, honestly, er, just five

5027
05:43:40,500 --> 05:43:41,500
streams.

5028
05:43:42,340 --> 05:43:43,340
Ugh.

5029
05:43:45,340 --> 05:43:47,340
Give me one second, I'm getting...

5030
05:43:47,340 --> 05:43:49,340
I'm not gonna do this.

5031
05:43:49,340 --> 05:43:53,340
Nine streams, one minute is like absolutely all of this.

5032
05:43:53,340 --> 05:43:55,340
I'm getting...

5033
05:43:57,340 --> 05:43:59,340
I'm getting a freaking seal, what?

5034
05:43:59,340 --> 05:44:02,340
I'm getting a big difference.

5035
05:44:02,340 --> 05:44:03,340
Ugh.

5036
05:44:03,340 --> 05:44:05,340
Okay, I can breathe again.

5037
05:44:06,180 --> 05:44:12,580
Right, we're gonna go into the cow's pen, and we're literally gonna go nuts in destroying

5038
05:44:12,580 --> 05:44:14,180
all these cows up ahead.

5039
05:44:14,180 --> 05:44:22,740
Okay, just so some people get nine in cooking by at skill 33 with 6,000 grapes and turning

5040
05:44:22,740 --> 05:44:23,740
them into wine.

5041
05:44:23,740 --> 05:44:25,580
Is that the fastest ice pee maker?

5042
05:44:25,580 --> 05:44:28,180
I thought it was sharks, but sharks are expensive.

5043
05:44:28,180 --> 05:44:29,180
Me.

5044
05:44:29,180 --> 05:44:33,180
Oh, someone wants to trade, sorry, sorry, I didn't see the offer.

5045
05:44:33,180 --> 05:44:35,180
What do you offer me?

5046
05:44:36,020 --> 05:44:37,020
Poison?

5047
05:44:37,020 --> 05:44:39,020
Are you telling me killing them?

5048
05:44:39,020 --> 05:44:41,020
Oh my God, what did you do?

5049
05:44:41,020 --> 05:44:43,020
Poison and fish food.

5050
05:44:43,020 --> 05:44:44,020
Reefland!

5051
05:44:44,020 --> 05:44:46,020
That's so mean!

5052
05:44:46,020 --> 05:44:50,020
I got given poison and freaking fish food.

5053
05:44:50,020 --> 05:44:54,020
Tell me, tell me you don't like me, without telling me you don't like me, Reefland.

5054
05:44:54,020 --> 05:44:55,020
Sheesh.

5055
05:44:55,020 --> 05:44:59,020
Right, let's absolutely destroy these cows.

5056
05:44:59,020 --> 05:45:03,780
Even if you just get a few, like to level up, I guess.

5057
05:45:03,820 --> 05:45:06,820
Even a tiny bit of a level up is better than nothing.

5058
05:45:06,820 --> 05:45:09,820
Something about not being able to burn wine?

5059
05:45:09,820 --> 05:45:12,820
Wine making's the fastest.

5060
05:45:12,820 --> 05:45:13,820
Okay.

5061
05:45:16,820 --> 05:45:19,820
Based Reefland, someone said.

5062
05:45:19,820 --> 05:45:25,820
Okay, just get the cows, just attack the cows at all willy nilly.

5063
05:45:25,820 --> 05:45:32,820
And then we can level up our combat a bit, because our combat is so low that we're like

5064
05:45:32,860 --> 05:45:35,860
really vulnerable to pretty much anything.

5065
05:45:35,860 --> 05:45:37,860
Destroy that Reefland.

5066
05:45:37,860 --> 05:45:39,860
Mods, slap them silly.

5067
05:45:39,860 --> 05:45:41,860
Mods, remove this man's chest.

5068
05:45:43,860 --> 05:45:45,860
Just cult things.

5069
05:45:47,860 --> 05:45:49,860
Why you following this noob?

5070
05:45:49,860 --> 05:45:51,860
Just cult things.

5071
05:45:51,860 --> 05:45:53,860
Okay, I love that answer.

5072
05:45:53,860 --> 05:45:55,860
Is there more cows over here?

5073
05:45:55,860 --> 05:45:56,860
Oh, there is!

5074
05:45:56,860 --> 05:45:57,860
There's like tons of cows.

5075
05:45:57,860 --> 05:46:00,860
Okay, and don't worry, you can attack everything in this field.

5076
05:46:00,900 --> 05:46:02,900
We'll just level up.

5077
05:46:02,900 --> 05:46:04,900
Oh, he said enjoy.

5078
05:46:06,900 --> 05:46:08,900
We will hunt them down.

5079
05:46:08,900 --> 05:46:13,900
Mods, put chewed up gum in this, in his best shoes.

5080
05:46:14,900 --> 05:46:17,900
Mods, make sure his pillow is always warm.

5081
05:46:19,900 --> 05:46:20,900
Yeah.

5082
05:46:20,900 --> 05:46:22,900
See, we're like literally already covered.

5083
05:46:22,900 --> 05:46:24,900
We're getting so strong.

5084
05:46:24,900 --> 05:46:27,900
We're just beating absolutely everything up.

5085
05:46:30,900 --> 05:46:33,900
Why did, actually, how did they know I'm a noob?

5086
05:46:33,900 --> 05:46:34,900
Is that the way I dress?

5087
05:46:34,900 --> 05:46:39,900
I'm literally wearing a thousand gold dreads, and they called me a noob.

5088
05:46:39,900 --> 05:46:42,900
Not to brag, but my combat level is five right now.

5089
05:46:42,900 --> 05:46:47,900
Like, I'm sorry, but runescape players quake when they see me.

5090
05:46:47,900 --> 05:46:49,900
I'm sorry, they just quake when they see me.

5091
05:46:49,900 --> 05:46:50,900
They can't help it.

5092
05:46:50,900 --> 05:46:52,900
Their timbers are shivered.

5093
05:46:52,900 --> 05:46:55,900
Whenever they see skullfish log in online.

5094
05:46:55,900 --> 05:46:57,900
Oh, I've only got four health.

5095
05:46:57,900 --> 05:46:59,900
I should maybe be a bit more careful, honestly.

5096
05:46:59,940 --> 05:47:01,940
Oh, I've only got three health.

5097
05:47:01,940 --> 05:47:03,940
Maybe I should be really careful.

5098
05:47:03,940 --> 05:47:11,940
Hmm, I'm not sure I can maybe fight the baby cows.

5099
05:47:11,940 --> 05:47:15,940
If I get beaten up by a cow, I'm going to be really embarrassed, okay?

5100
05:47:15,940 --> 05:47:18,940
Oh my god, a baby cow, destroy it.

5101
05:47:18,940 --> 05:47:21,940
Combat level five, literally.

5102
05:47:21,940 --> 05:47:26,940
We quiver before you as well, but for different reasons.

5103
05:47:29,940 --> 05:47:34,940
Oh my god, the way that we think rolls over as well is so sad.

5104
05:47:34,940 --> 05:47:37,940
I'm planting some booms.

5105
05:47:37,940 --> 05:47:39,940
All right.

5106
05:47:39,940 --> 05:47:42,940
I can only attack baby cows, because I've only got three HP.

5107
05:47:42,940 --> 05:47:47,940
I swear, if any reefling perishes against cows, I'm going to be embarrassed for result, okay?

5108
05:47:47,940 --> 05:47:49,940
Oh, sorry, someone said they wished to trade.

5109
05:47:49,940 --> 05:47:50,940
Sorry, sorry.

5110
05:47:50,940 --> 05:47:53,940
Let me beat up this baby cow, and then I'll accept the trade.

5111
05:47:53,980 --> 05:47:57,980
Wah, wah, wah.

5112
05:47:57,980 --> 05:47:59,980
Oh my god, I'm on one HP.

5113
05:47:59,980 --> 05:48:01,980
No way this baby cow is going to get me.

5114
05:48:01,980 --> 05:48:03,980
Mauds, are you...

5115
05:48:03,980 --> 05:48:05,980
I'm going to get killed by a baby cow.

5116
05:48:05,980 --> 05:48:08,980
I need to get out of the field, oh my god.

5117
05:48:08,980 --> 05:48:10,980
I'm one HP in a dream.

5118
05:48:10,980 --> 05:48:12,980
Hold on, right, let's try that again.

5119
05:48:12,980 --> 05:48:16,980
Okay, I literally am the one that's going to perish from the cow.

5120
05:48:16,980 --> 05:48:19,980
Hold on, let me accept this trade.

5121
05:48:19,980 --> 05:48:21,980
I'm so sorry.

5122
05:48:22,020 --> 05:48:24,020
Chin up, offer?

5123
05:48:26,020 --> 05:48:28,020
Oh no, can you not trade?

5124
05:48:28,020 --> 05:48:30,020
That's okay if you can't do it in time.

5125
05:48:30,020 --> 05:48:34,020
Uh, I guess we'll just hang about here, yeah?

5126
05:48:34,020 --> 05:48:35,020
We're just going to hang about...

5127
05:48:35,020 --> 05:48:37,020
Oh, they're cooking meat.

5128
05:48:37,020 --> 05:48:39,020
Cannot trade, yeah, I'm a new account.

5129
05:48:39,020 --> 05:48:41,020
It's because I'm not cleaning up.

5130
05:48:41,020 --> 05:48:43,020
Do you have meat?

5131
05:48:43,020 --> 05:48:45,020
Excuse me, little reefling.

5132
05:48:45,020 --> 05:48:48,020
Uh, can I get some of your meat?

5133
05:48:48,060 --> 05:48:52,060
Please, one bit of meat so I can heal.

5134
05:48:54,060 --> 05:48:56,060
Just one meat.

5135
05:48:56,060 --> 05:48:57,060
Oh, you not got any?

5136
05:48:57,060 --> 05:48:59,060
I saw you cooking though.

5137
05:49:00,060 --> 05:49:02,060
I do not have any.

5138
05:49:02,060 --> 05:49:06,060
Oh wait, I can make some if I pick up some off the ground.

5139
05:49:06,060 --> 05:49:09,060
Wait a minute, hold on a minute, I can do it my...

5140
05:49:09,060 --> 05:49:11,060
I'm an independent strummer.

5141
05:49:11,060 --> 05:49:14,060
Use the meat on the fire and then eat the meat.

5142
05:49:14,060 --> 05:49:16,060
It's genius.

5143
05:49:16,100 --> 05:49:17,100
I did it!

5144
05:49:17,100 --> 05:49:20,100
Okay, we can go back to slay and let's go.

5145
05:49:20,100 --> 05:49:23,100
We'll get a few more combat levels like this.

5146
05:49:23,100 --> 05:49:26,100
Chicken's going to only hit zero, so that's good for you, accounts.

5147
05:49:26,100 --> 05:49:29,100
No, we need a challenge for the coup.

5148
05:49:34,100 --> 05:49:36,100
Uh, we're now attack level four.

5149
05:49:36,100 --> 05:49:38,100
Oh my god, we're getting too strong.

5150
05:49:38,100 --> 05:49:40,100
We can't handle this.

5151
05:49:40,100 --> 05:49:42,100
When we enter the lobby...

5152
05:49:42,100 --> 05:49:45,100
I'm going to actually cook again because I want to heal up.

5153
05:49:46,100 --> 05:49:47,100
GGG.

5154
05:49:47,100 --> 05:49:50,100
I'm gaming so hard right now.

5155
05:49:50,100 --> 05:49:52,100
Oh no, I burnt it!

5156
05:49:52,100 --> 05:49:56,100
I thought we were high enough level not to burn level one me, honestly.

5157
05:50:00,100 --> 05:50:02,100
I don't know what combat level we are.

5158
05:50:02,100 --> 05:50:04,100
We're combat level five.

5159
05:50:04,100 --> 05:50:06,100
Surely that's enough for questing.

5160
05:50:06,100 --> 05:50:07,100
Surely.

5161
05:50:07,100 --> 05:50:09,100
Copium.

5162
05:50:09,100 --> 05:50:12,100
Let me know wild strong, you can survive in nature.

5163
05:50:12,100 --> 05:50:15,100
It's rough out in nature, it's rough.

5164
05:50:16,100 --> 05:50:20,100
I just need to heal and then I can start walloping everything again.

5165
05:50:20,100 --> 05:50:22,100
There, boom.

5166
05:50:22,100 --> 05:50:28,100
Uh, let me keep the attack or is it better to like swap between like the same thing, so...

5167
05:50:28,100 --> 05:50:30,100
Cows can burn.

5168
05:50:30,100 --> 05:50:32,100
It's genius!

5169
05:50:32,100 --> 05:50:35,100
Shit over here.

5170
05:50:35,100 --> 05:50:39,100
Why do the farmers randomly let you perish their cows?

5171
05:50:39,100 --> 05:50:42,100
Honestly, I'm not even sure.

5172
05:50:42,140 --> 05:50:50,140
Wait, I think it might be faster to do like strength and then I might get like a combat level faster.

5173
05:50:50,140 --> 05:50:51,140
I'm not sure if that's right though.

5174
05:50:51,140 --> 05:50:54,140
I could be completely wrong about that.

5175
05:50:54,140 --> 05:50:57,140
Wait, there's like more cows over here, we can use annihilate.

5176
05:50:57,140 --> 05:50:59,140
Yeah, there's like tons over here.

5177
05:51:02,140 --> 05:51:04,140
Best to train strength.

5178
05:51:04,180 --> 05:51:10,180
Alright, maybe defense because like I've not got much HP points.

5179
05:51:10,180 --> 05:51:12,180
Like I only got 10.

5180
05:51:12,180 --> 05:51:14,180
Oh sorry, someone wishes to trade with me.

5181
05:51:14,180 --> 05:51:18,180
Drop some meat over here if you want to strong any things I can't trade.

5182
05:51:18,180 --> 05:51:20,180
The reeflings feeding me.

5183
05:51:20,180 --> 05:51:22,180
Oh, they're feeding me.

5184
05:51:22,180 --> 05:51:24,180
Thank you reeflings.

5185
05:51:24,180 --> 05:51:26,180
That's a lot of meat.

5186
05:51:26,180 --> 05:51:28,180
Jeez, you're a packin.

5187
05:51:28,180 --> 05:51:30,180
Is that six whole meat for me?

5188
05:51:30,180 --> 05:51:32,180
It is, thank you.

5189
05:51:32,220 --> 05:51:34,220
Am I baiting to it?

5190
05:51:34,220 --> 05:51:36,220
Oh wait, I'm already full health.

5191
05:51:36,220 --> 05:51:38,220
Wait, I only have 9 HP?

5192
05:51:38,220 --> 05:51:40,220
No, I have 10 HP, that's like tiny.

5193
05:51:40,220 --> 05:51:42,220
Azura remainder.

5194
05:51:42,220 --> 05:51:44,220
Azura duly is going live.

5195
05:51:44,220 --> 05:51:46,220
I'm unsure what game she's playing.

5196
05:51:48,220 --> 05:51:50,220
Oh my god, check out the outfit.

5197
05:51:50,220 --> 05:51:52,220
Check out the drip.

5198
05:51:52,220 --> 05:51:54,220
Let's say drip out in the color scheme.

5199
05:51:54,260 --> 05:51:56,260
We're getting there, we're getting there.

5200
05:51:56,260 --> 05:51:58,260
Surely.

5201
05:51:58,260 --> 05:52:00,260
Oh my god, do you know what that reminds me of?

5202
05:52:00,260 --> 05:52:02,260
I think the reason why I laugh so much at that

5203
05:52:02,260 --> 05:52:04,260
is because of this.

5204
05:52:04,260 --> 05:52:06,260
Right, hear me out.

5205
05:52:06,260 --> 05:52:08,260
Hear me out.

5206
05:52:08,260 --> 05:52:10,260
Where is it?

5207
05:52:10,260 --> 05:52:12,260
Let me find it.

5208
05:52:12,260 --> 05:52:14,260
I think that's why that makes me laugh so much.

5209
05:52:14,260 --> 05:52:16,260
Because it looks so good.

5210
05:52:16,260 --> 05:52:18,260
Oh my god.

5211
05:52:18,300 --> 05:52:20,300
Let me find it.

5212
05:52:20,300 --> 05:52:22,300
I think that's why

5213
05:52:22,300 --> 05:52:24,300
that makes me laugh so much.

5214
05:52:24,300 --> 05:52:26,300
Because it looks so ridiculous.

5215
05:52:26,300 --> 05:52:28,300
That's the only reason I like the headbanging

5216
05:52:28,300 --> 05:52:30,300
the most.

5217
05:52:32,300 --> 05:52:34,300
This is absolutely ridiculous.

5218
05:52:40,300 --> 05:52:42,300
Wow.

5219
05:52:42,300 --> 05:52:44,300
I don't know.

5220
05:52:44,300 --> 05:52:46,300
Is level 6 combat enough to not get attacked

5221
05:52:46,340 --> 05:52:48,340
all the time?

5222
05:52:48,340 --> 05:52:50,340
Sorry, I look sussy.

5223
05:52:50,340 --> 05:52:52,340
Sorry, I said that wrong.

5224
05:52:52,340 --> 05:52:54,340
I don't mean to say it like that.

5225
05:52:54,340 --> 05:52:56,340
Oh, I'm level 2 strength.

5226
05:52:56,340 --> 05:52:58,340
Check me out.

5227
05:52:58,340 --> 05:53:00,340
Oh sorry, someone wants to trade with me.

5228
05:53:00,340 --> 05:53:02,340
I'm sorry, I missed it.

5229
05:53:02,340 --> 05:53:04,340
I'm too fatigued.

5230
05:53:04,340 --> 05:53:06,340
I'm too enthralled

5231
05:53:06,340 --> 05:53:08,340
with perishing these cows to get some level ups.

5232
05:53:08,340 --> 05:53:10,340
Very beefy.

5233
05:53:10,340 --> 05:53:12,340
I'm sorry.

5234
05:53:12,340 --> 05:53:14,340
Look, I've got things on my mind, you know.

5235
05:53:14,380 --> 05:53:16,380
Are the marshmallows up again recently?

5236
05:53:16,380 --> 05:53:18,380
Oh yeah.

5237
05:53:18,380 --> 05:53:20,380
Hee hee hee.

5238
05:53:22,380 --> 05:53:24,380
Okay.

5239
05:53:24,380 --> 05:53:26,380
Accept trade.

5240
05:53:26,380 --> 05:53:28,380
What? Show me what you got.

5241
05:53:28,380 --> 05:53:30,380
Oh, it's a strength potion

5242
05:53:30,380 --> 05:53:32,380
and cooked salmon.

5243
05:53:32,380 --> 05:53:34,380
Okay.

5244
05:53:34,380 --> 05:53:36,380
I don't know how long.

5245
05:53:36,380 --> 05:53:38,380
I only wanted to be here for like a wee bit

5246
05:53:38,380 --> 05:53:40,380
and then we'll go straight back in

5247
05:53:40,380 --> 05:53:42,380
to leveling up cooking.

5248
05:53:42,420 --> 05:53:44,420
I accidentally save questing a little too much.

5249
05:53:44,420 --> 05:53:46,420
What I wanted to do was get some levels.

5250
05:53:46,420 --> 05:53:48,420
So when we do airness to chicken,

5251
05:53:48,420 --> 05:53:50,420
we don't all perish.

5252
05:53:50,420 --> 05:53:52,420
I think we can run away

5253
05:53:52,420 --> 05:53:54,420
for whatever is going on.

5254
05:53:54,420 --> 05:53:56,420
Oh yeah, you know all right.

5255
05:53:56,420 --> 05:53:58,420
Hee hee hee hee.

5256
05:53:58,420 --> 05:54:00,420
I just didn't want us to perish

5257
05:54:00,420 --> 05:54:02,420
really quickly when we did airness to chicken.

5258
05:54:02,420 --> 05:54:04,420
I don't know what Azur is live with.

5259
05:54:07,420 --> 05:54:09,420
Thank you very much, Refling,

5260
05:54:09,420 --> 05:54:11,420
for all the food supplies as well.

5261
05:54:11,460 --> 05:54:13,460
Um.

5262
05:54:13,460 --> 05:54:15,460
Almost like up my strength.

5263
05:54:15,460 --> 05:54:17,460
Level up, level up.

5264
05:54:17,460 --> 05:54:19,460
Ooh.

5265
05:54:19,460 --> 05:54:21,460
Combat level six, unstoppable.

5266
05:54:21,460 --> 05:54:23,460
Truly unstoppable.

5267
05:54:23,460 --> 05:54:25,460
They cannot, they cannot.

5268
05:54:25,460 --> 05:54:27,460
Strength potion for stronger.

5269
05:54:27,460 --> 05:54:29,460
Ah.

5270
05:54:29,460 --> 05:54:31,460
Okay, I took a sip.

5271
05:54:31,460 --> 05:54:33,460
I don't know how long it lasts.

5272
05:54:33,460 --> 05:54:35,460
Wait, where's the effect?

5273
05:54:35,460 --> 05:54:37,460
I don't know how long these things,

5274
05:54:37,460 --> 05:54:39,460
the pots last.

5275
05:54:39,500 --> 05:54:41,500
Ooh.

5276
05:54:41,500 --> 05:54:43,500
I've cast up this much of a fate.

5277
05:54:43,500 --> 05:54:45,500
I fear what bulls are capable of.

5278
05:54:45,500 --> 05:54:47,500
She can now destroy baby cows with ease.

5279
05:54:47,500 --> 05:54:49,500
I truly am evil.

5280
05:54:49,500 --> 05:54:51,500
Truly.

5281
05:54:51,500 --> 05:54:53,500
I don't know how long it lasts.

5282
05:54:55,500 --> 05:54:57,500
Strength potion, yeah.

5283
05:54:57,500 --> 05:54:59,500
Top left the fist.

5284
05:54:59,500 --> 05:55:01,500
So the strength boosts.

5285
05:55:03,500 --> 05:55:05,500
60 seconds?

5286
05:55:05,500 --> 05:55:07,500
No, it does not last.

5287
05:55:07,540 --> 05:55:09,540
It lasts 60 seconds.

5288
05:55:09,540 --> 05:55:11,540
It's so small when you heal.

5289
05:55:11,540 --> 05:55:13,540
Oh, salmon heals a lot, actually.

5290
05:55:13,540 --> 05:55:15,540
We need to start like a salmon ring.

5291
05:55:17,540 --> 05:55:19,540
Is it normal to heal multiple,

5292
05:55:19,540 --> 05:55:21,540
strong voices simultaneously in my head?

5293
05:55:21,540 --> 05:55:23,540
I hope not. If I left the echo on.

5294
05:55:26,540 --> 05:55:28,540
One boosted start point,

5295
05:55:28,540 --> 05:55:30,540
dreams every 30 seconds.

5296
05:55:30,540 --> 05:55:32,540
That's so quick.

5297
05:55:32,540 --> 05:55:34,540
Ooh.

5298
05:55:34,540 --> 05:55:36,540
I'm no strength level four.

5299
05:55:36,580 --> 05:55:38,580
I'm rolling these cows.

5300
05:55:38,580 --> 05:55:40,580
There's no echo.

5301
05:55:40,580 --> 05:55:42,580
Okay.

5302
05:55:42,580 --> 05:55:44,580
It's just a reef flings finally losing the plot.

5303
05:55:44,580 --> 05:55:46,580
I now can have a live in HP.

5304
05:55:46,580 --> 05:55:48,580
Okay, maybe we should have done

5305
05:55:48,580 --> 05:55:50,580
a bit of training a wee bit earlier.

5306
05:55:50,580 --> 05:55:52,580
But look, we're leveling up.

5307
05:55:52,580 --> 05:55:54,580
That's the main thing.

5308
05:55:54,580 --> 05:55:56,580
We're getting there.

5309
05:55:56,580 --> 05:55:58,580
I don't know if we should maybe go for like

5310
05:55:58,580 --> 05:56:00,580
five.

5311
05:56:02,580 --> 05:56:04,580
Hmm.

5312
05:56:04,620 --> 05:56:06,620
I'm thinking he's becoming an extra strongy pill.

5313
05:56:06,620 --> 05:56:09,620
So it depends on how strong your potion has boosted you.

5314
05:56:09,620 --> 05:56:12,620
Azure is playing one shot.

5315
05:56:12,620 --> 05:56:14,620
Like how strong he sounds excited

5316
05:56:14,620 --> 05:56:16,620
every time she unlocks levels.

5317
05:56:16,620 --> 05:56:18,620
It's so satisfying.

5318
05:56:18,620 --> 05:56:20,620
It's like, you've unlocked a new level,

5319
05:56:20,620 --> 05:56:22,620
but yeah, I have.

5320
05:56:22,620 --> 05:56:24,620
I'm such a big girl.

5321
05:56:24,620 --> 05:56:26,620
I'm so smart.

5322
05:56:26,620 --> 05:56:28,620
It's MRT.

5323
05:56:28,620 --> 05:56:30,620
Hmm.

5324
05:56:30,620 --> 05:56:32,620
Hydration check.

5325
05:56:32,660 --> 05:56:34,660
I think the echo effect,

5326
05:56:34,660 --> 05:56:36,660
if I was playing a video game,

5327
05:56:36,660 --> 05:56:38,660
doesn't sound that good.

5328
05:56:38,660 --> 05:56:40,660
Like, this is, for example,

5329
05:56:40,660 --> 05:56:42,660
what would sound like,

5330
05:56:42,660 --> 05:56:44,660
oh, I'm just killing this dude right now.

5331
05:56:44,660 --> 05:56:46,660
It just sounds mental.

5332
05:56:46,660 --> 05:56:48,660
It sounds like you've lost the plot.

5333
05:56:48,660 --> 05:56:50,660
You've actually lost the plot.

5334
05:56:50,660 --> 05:56:52,660
It's not sounding good, you know?

5335
05:56:52,660 --> 05:56:54,660
There.

5336
05:56:54,660 --> 05:56:56,660
That should be it back to me.

5337
05:56:56,660 --> 05:56:58,660
I think I got unsubtremised

5338
05:56:58,660 --> 05:57:00,660
channel. It's very plausible.

5339
05:57:00,700 --> 05:57:02,700
I think it should be in

5340
05:57:02,700 --> 05:57:04,700
my description.

5341
05:57:04,700 --> 05:57:06,700
Right, we'll do

5342
05:57:06,700 --> 05:57:08,700
five defense.

5343
05:57:08,700 --> 05:57:10,700
We're almost level seven combat.

5344
05:57:10,700 --> 05:57:12,700
Let's go.

5345
05:57:12,700 --> 05:57:14,700
Oh my god, Serenity!

5346
05:57:16,700 --> 05:57:18,700
How are you doing? How was your stream?

5347
05:57:18,700 --> 05:57:20,700
Even though you'll probably be exhausted

5348
05:57:20,700 --> 05:57:22,700
and the last thing you want to do

5349
05:57:22,700 --> 05:57:24,700
is get a ton of heck in comments

5350
05:57:24,700 --> 05:57:26,700
and be like, I'm not making a stream.

5351
05:57:26,700 --> 05:57:28,700
I don't know.

5352
05:57:28,740 --> 05:57:30,740
How, hopefully it was good though

5353
05:57:30,740 --> 05:57:32,740
and you had fun. Hi Raiders!

5354
05:57:32,740 --> 05:57:34,740
I'm Strony Cuttles from Veiler

5355
05:57:34,740 --> 05:57:36,740
and I'm currently doing

5356
05:57:36,740 --> 05:57:38,740
my stream snipe game of the day,

5357
05:57:38,740 --> 05:57:40,740
of the week, sorry.

5358
05:57:40,740 --> 05:57:42,740
We're playing old-school Rinscape.

5359
05:57:42,740 --> 05:57:44,740
We're in World 3a, which is free to play

5360
05:57:44,740 --> 05:57:46,740
and we're just leveling up our accounts a little bit

5361
05:57:46,740 --> 05:57:48,740
because we are super weak

5362
05:57:48,740 --> 05:57:50,740
and I'm scared to

5363
05:57:50,740 --> 05:57:52,740
send us quests, because someone might fall down.

5364
05:57:54,740 --> 05:57:56,740
What level is your attack?

5365
05:57:56,780 --> 05:57:58,780
My attack is four.

5366
05:57:58,780 --> 05:58:00,780
Strength is five and defense is one.

5367
05:58:00,780 --> 05:58:02,780
I'm currently doing defense right now.

5368
05:58:02,780 --> 05:58:04,780
Just to try and get

5369
05:58:04,780 --> 05:58:06,780
overall combat level.

5370
05:58:06,780 --> 05:58:08,780
Speedy Bun Raid.

5371
05:58:08,780 --> 05:58:10,780
I never saw Rinscape before.

5372
05:58:10,780 --> 05:58:12,780
Oh, it's basically

5373
05:58:12,780 --> 05:58:14,780
an incremental game

5374
05:58:14,780 --> 05:58:16,780
and you just click.

5375
05:58:16,780 --> 05:58:18,780
Literally, this is the graphics.

5376
05:58:18,780 --> 05:58:20,780
I'm not even kidding, check me out.

5377
05:58:20,780 --> 05:58:22,780
I've got a gold plated chef's hat on.

5378
05:58:22,780 --> 05:58:24,780
Gold apron on.

5379
05:58:24,820 --> 05:58:26,820
You've not seen anything bear.

5380
05:58:26,820 --> 05:58:28,820
Just amazing.

5381
05:58:28,820 --> 05:58:30,820
It's a sweetie bun raid.

5382
05:58:30,820 --> 05:58:32,820
Bun bun raid.

5383
05:58:34,820 --> 05:58:36,820
Help, I've fallen.

5384
05:58:36,820 --> 05:58:38,820
I'm literally dropped out.

5385
05:58:38,820 --> 05:58:40,820
Why did I get a message?

5386
05:58:40,820 --> 05:58:42,820
I'll be logged in in 30 minutes.

5387
05:58:42,820 --> 05:58:44,820
But yeah, we're just leveling up

5388
05:58:44,820 --> 05:58:46,820
because

5389
05:58:46,820 --> 05:58:48,820
we want to do some questions.

5390
05:58:48,820 --> 05:58:50,820
That's weird.

5391
05:58:50,820 --> 05:58:52,820
I always saw the YouTube make up

5392
05:58:52,860 --> 05:58:54,860
that's not the default graphics.

5393
05:58:54,860 --> 05:58:56,860
Oh, at least even worse

5394
05:58:56,860 --> 05:58:58,860
than this.

5395
05:58:58,860 --> 05:59:00,860
Oh, it's been six hours

5396
05:59:00,860 --> 05:59:02,860
already. I didn't realize either.

5397
05:59:02,860 --> 05:59:04,860
Sorry for stealing all your time, guys.

5398
05:59:04,860 --> 05:59:07,860
Time flies when you're having fun.

5399
05:59:07,860 --> 05:59:09,860
Time flies.

5400
05:59:09,860 --> 05:59:11,860
This is peak graphics.

5401
05:59:11,860 --> 05:59:13,860
You do not get better than this.

5402
05:59:13,860 --> 05:59:15,860
The year is 2024.

5403
05:59:15,860 --> 05:59:17,860
Let's admire

5404
05:59:17,860 --> 05:59:19,860
the daisies right here.

5405
05:59:19,860 --> 05:59:21,860
Let's zoom in a little.

5406
05:59:21,900 --> 05:59:23,900
Look at these, man.

5407
05:59:23,900 --> 05:59:25,900
Beautiful.

5408
05:59:25,900 --> 05:59:27,900
You can see every poly...

5409
05:59:27,900 --> 05:59:29,900
What's that, a poly thing?

5410
05:59:29,900 --> 05:59:31,900
Every triangle.

5411
05:59:31,900 --> 05:59:33,900
Oh.

5412
05:59:33,900 --> 05:59:35,900
All the triangles are made out.

5413
05:59:38,900 --> 05:59:40,900
Oh, I've reached

5414
05:59:40,900 --> 05:59:42,900
a total level of 100.

5415
05:59:42,900 --> 05:59:44,900
Ooh, our accounts are getting bear.

5416
05:59:44,900 --> 05:59:46,900
We've

5417
05:59:46,900 --> 05:59:48,900
started on fresh accounts.

5418
05:59:48,940 --> 05:59:50,940
So, all that got censored.

5419
05:59:50,940 --> 05:59:52,940
It did.

5420
05:59:52,940 --> 05:59:54,940
Hold on, let me eat a salmon.

5421
05:59:54,940 --> 05:59:56,940
Well, we're at combat level 7.

5422
05:59:56,940 --> 05:59:58,940
Oh, we are getting potent.

5423
05:59:58,940 --> 06:00:00,940
Okay.

5424
06:00:00,940 --> 06:00:02,940
Polygon, that's what I meant.

5425
06:00:02,940 --> 06:00:04,940
Yeah, polygon.

5426
06:00:04,940 --> 06:00:06,940
But if anyone looks as funny,

5427
06:00:06,940 --> 06:00:08,940
I'm gonna get them.

5428
06:00:08,940 --> 06:00:10,940
Level 7, go and get them.

5429
06:00:10,940 --> 06:00:12,940
They can't handle.

5430
06:00:12,940 --> 06:00:14,940
They can't handle it.

5431
06:00:14,940 --> 06:00:16,940
Laracraft,

5432
06:00:16,980 --> 06:00:18,980
honestly.

5433
06:00:18,980 --> 06:00:20,980
Okay, think

5434
06:00:20,980 --> 06:00:22,980
we're getting there, we're getting there.

5435
06:00:22,980 --> 06:00:24,980
Maybe we do 5 on each.

5436
06:00:24,980 --> 06:00:26,980
Eat combat means

5437
06:00:26,980 --> 06:00:28,980
we can survive a little bit of a hit.

5438
06:00:28,980 --> 06:00:30,980
A little bit of a punch, if you will.

5439
06:00:30,980 --> 06:00:32,980
Triangle.

5440
06:00:32,980 --> 06:00:34,980
Oh, that should have been...

5441
06:00:34,980 --> 06:00:36,980
Is there a other name?

5442
06:00:38,980 --> 06:00:40,980
Yeah, we tricked everything.

5443
06:00:40,980 --> 06:00:42,980
Wow.

5444
06:00:42,980 --> 06:00:44,980
And then wherever Ernie's chicken starts,

5445
06:00:45,020 --> 06:00:47,020
I'm actually unsure.

5446
06:00:49,020 --> 06:00:51,020
Wow, level 4.

5447
06:00:51,020 --> 06:00:53,020
Did I put my combat?

5448
06:00:53,020 --> 06:00:55,020
We're at 7.6 for combat.

5449
06:00:55,020 --> 06:00:57,020
I like how it shows you the increment as well.

5450
06:00:57,020 --> 06:00:59,020
To be like, you're getting closer.

5451
06:00:59,020 --> 06:01:01,020
I'm pretty sure prayer counts

5452
06:01:01,020 --> 06:01:03,020
to your overall combat level as well.

5453
06:01:03,020 --> 06:01:05,020
So, I hit Fondle of Triangles.

5454
06:01:08,020 --> 06:01:10,020
So, I don't know if we should do some...

5455
06:01:10,020 --> 06:01:12,020
I've never done...

5456
06:01:12,020 --> 06:01:14,020
Is it the altar?

5457
06:01:14,060 --> 06:01:16,060
Dragon bone altar run, but they're so expensive.

5458
06:01:16,060 --> 06:01:18,060
And I would need personal guards

5459
06:01:18,060 --> 06:01:20,060
all the way over.

5460
06:01:23,060 --> 06:01:25,060
See, that's the fastest way

5461
06:01:25,060 --> 06:01:27,060
to level up prayer, I believe.

5462
06:01:27,060 --> 06:01:29,060
But yeah.

5463
06:01:29,060 --> 06:01:31,060
Watching Stronny and Emile and Spirits

5464
06:01:31,060 --> 06:01:33,060
playing a game on my own almost feels like

5465
06:01:33,060 --> 06:01:35,060
I have a friend.

5466
06:01:35,060 --> 06:01:37,060
Isn't there no sensory overload doing that?

5467
06:01:37,060 --> 06:01:39,060
I feel like

5468
06:01:39,060 --> 06:01:41,060
I'd be like, I couldn't handle it.

5469
06:01:41,060 --> 06:01:43,060
I feel like there's too much going on.

5470
06:01:44,060 --> 06:01:46,060
Is Emi enjoying her game so far?

5471
06:01:54,060 --> 06:01:56,060
I already need a P again.

5472
06:01:56,060 --> 06:01:58,060
I feel like whenever I have a T,

5473
06:01:58,060 --> 06:02:00,060
she's loving it, oh, I'm glad.

5474
06:02:00,060 --> 06:02:02,060
That's what I like to hear.

5475
06:02:02,060 --> 06:02:04,060
See, I knew a picture.

5476
06:02:04,060 --> 06:02:06,060
Oh, I'm level 4 health.

5477
06:02:06,060 --> 06:02:08,060
Sorry, 4 HP.

5478
06:02:08,060 --> 06:02:10,060
I think

5479
06:02:10,060 --> 06:02:12,060
there's everyone at least level...

5480
06:02:12,100 --> 06:02:14,100
So we've got level 6 refling.

5481
06:02:14,100 --> 06:02:16,100
Yeah, that's good.

5482
06:02:16,100 --> 06:02:18,100
Okay, apparently we get

5483
06:02:18,100 --> 06:02:20,100
level 5 in attack.

5484
06:02:20,100 --> 06:02:22,100
We're getting leveled up.

5485
06:02:22,100 --> 06:02:24,100
We've got level 10 refling over there.

5486
06:02:24,100 --> 06:02:26,100
I can't tell.

5487
06:02:26,100 --> 06:02:28,100
We've got level 6 as well.

5488
06:02:28,100 --> 06:02:30,100
Yeah, we're getting a bit better.

5489
06:02:30,100 --> 06:02:32,100
Getting a bit better.

5490
06:02:32,100 --> 06:02:34,100
We're definitely not to be tripled with

5491
06:02:34,100 --> 06:02:36,100
even though we're not level 10 combat yet.

5492
06:02:36,100 --> 06:02:38,100
But we're not to be missed with.

5493
06:02:38,100 --> 06:02:40,100
How do you pee so much yet so little?

5494
06:02:40,140 --> 06:02:43,140
I know that caffeine makes you want to wee-wee all the time.

5495
06:02:43,140 --> 06:02:45,140
So I think it might be because I'm having

5496
06:02:45,140 --> 06:02:47,140
so much T's from my throat.

5497
06:02:48,140 --> 06:02:49,140
Yay!

5498
06:02:49,140 --> 06:02:51,140
We're like doing little mini tasks as well.

5499
06:02:57,140 --> 06:02:59,140
Someone wants to trade.

5500
06:02:59,140 --> 06:03:01,140
You wish to trade. I accept your trade.

5501
06:03:01,140 --> 06:03:03,140
What do you wish to trade me?

5502
06:03:03,140 --> 06:03:06,140
Oh, I don't know if I can wear this, actually.

5503
06:03:06,140 --> 06:03:08,140
I don't know if it's too...

5504
06:03:08,180 --> 06:03:09,180
strong.

5505
06:03:09,180 --> 06:03:11,180
Like, I can't wear it yet.

5506
06:03:12,180 --> 06:03:15,180
I trade absolutely nothing.

5507
06:03:15,180 --> 06:03:17,180
Oh no, I took my apron off.

5508
06:03:17,180 --> 06:03:20,180
Oh my god, I have to pick between drip or function.

5509
06:03:20,180 --> 06:03:22,180
I think I have to pick between drip.

5510
06:03:22,180 --> 06:03:24,180
I'm so sorry.

5511
06:03:24,180 --> 06:03:26,180
Do you want your steel plate body back?

5512
06:03:28,180 --> 06:03:30,180
Sorry, the drip is for life.

5513
06:03:30,180 --> 06:03:32,180
For real, for real. The drip is for life.

5514
06:03:32,180 --> 06:03:34,180
I mean, check this out.

5515
06:03:34,180 --> 06:03:36,180
I mean, check it out.

5516
06:03:36,220 --> 06:03:38,220
It's so good. Okay, sure.

5517
06:03:38,220 --> 06:03:40,220
You want to trade with me?

5518
06:03:40,220 --> 06:03:42,220
I swear if it's more poison.

5519
06:03:42,220 --> 06:03:44,220
What is this? Crossbow?

5520
06:03:44,220 --> 06:03:46,220
Oh!

5521
06:03:48,220 --> 06:03:50,220
Whoa!

5522
06:03:50,220 --> 06:03:52,220
Wait, a pink skirt? Are you dressing me up?

5523
06:03:52,220 --> 06:03:54,220
I can't believe reeflings are dressing me up.

5524
06:03:54,220 --> 06:03:56,220
First cosplay stream confirmed.

5525
06:03:56,220 --> 06:03:58,220
Oh, look at the long drip.

5526
06:03:58,220 --> 06:04:00,220
I said Tee-hee.

5527
06:04:00,220 --> 06:04:02,220
I said Tee-hee, you're not getting Tee.

5528
06:04:02,220 --> 06:04:04,220
I put little crossbow ball tips on.

5529
06:04:04,260 --> 06:04:06,260
Whoa!

5530
06:04:06,260 --> 06:04:08,260
Okay, okay.

5531
06:04:08,260 --> 06:04:10,260
Wait, I think the skamar is better.

5532
06:04:10,260 --> 06:04:12,260
What is it called?

5533
06:04:12,260 --> 06:04:14,260
A steel skamar.

5534
06:04:14,260 --> 06:04:16,260
Okay.

5535
06:04:16,260 --> 06:04:18,260
I've got skamar.

5536
06:04:18,260 --> 06:04:20,260
I'm not afraid to use it.

5537
06:04:20,260 --> 06:04:22,260
Even in the game,

5538
06:04:22,260 --> 06:04:24,260
she has a dumpy, honestly.

5539
06:04:24,260 --> 06:04:26,260
The pencil dress.

5540
06:04:26,260 --> 06:04:28,260
Yeah, I mean, look at that.

5541
06:04:28,260 --> 06:04:30,260
Wow, look at them polygons.

5542
06:04:30,260 --> 06:04:32,260
Oh yeah, it's all coming together.

5543
06:04:32,300 --> 06:04:34,300
Great.

5544
06:04:34,300 --> 06:04:36,300
We will start airing as the chicken, I think.

5545
06:04:36,300 --> 06:04:38,300
Oh, there's an imp.

5546
06:04:38,300 --> 06:04:40,300
If I pick up a bead, I'm pretty sure.

5547
06:04:40,300 --> 06:04:42,300
Beat that imp up.

5548
06:04:42,300 --> 06:04:44,300
Or I'll beat it up.

5549
06:04:44,300 --> 06:04:46,300
Don't worry, I'll get it.

5550
06:04:46,300 --> 06:04:48,300
I don't want, I don't want because the cave's in the way.

5551
06:04:48,300 --> 06:04:50,300
Okay, now we beat the imp up.

5552
06:04:50,300 --> 06:04:52,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, beat him up.

5553
06:04:52,300 --> 06:04:54,300
If he drops a colored bead,

5554
06:04:54,300 --> 06:04:56,300
we can use it for the wizard quest.

5555
06:04:56,300 --> 06:04:58,300
I just realized I never killed it,

5556
06:04:58,300 --> 06:05:00,300
so I can't tell.

5557
06:05:01,300 --> 06:05:03,300
We'll never know what it dropped.

5558
06:05:03,300 --> 06:05:05,300
Oh wait, did it drop something?

5559
06:05:07,300 --> 06:05:09,300
Oh, it did!

5560
06:05:09,300 --> 06:05:11,300
Okay, we need it for the wizard tower quest,

5561
06:05:11,300 --> 06:05:13,300
but completely forgotten,

5562
06:05:13,300 --> 06:05:15,300
you need like four different components.

5563
06:05:17,300 --> 06:05:20,300
What are the consequences of death in this game?

5564
06:05:20,300 --> 06:05:22,300
I think you keep your three highest

5565
06:05:22,300 --> 06:05:26,300
priced items or something like that.

5566
06:05:26,300 --> 06:05:28,300
Right,

5567
06:05:28,300 --> 06:05:31,300
the three reflings are,

5568
06:05:31,300 --> 06:05:33,300
I'm going to stand at the gate,

5569
06:05:33,300 --> 06:05:35,300
and I'll wait for everyone to come over.

5570
06:05:35,300 --> 06:05:38,300
So if you want to stand outside the gate of the cow pen,

5571
06:05:38,300 --> 06:05:40,300
we will go do Ernest the chicken next,

5572
06:05:40,300 --> 06:05:44,300
and then we'll actually do some

5573
06:05:44,300 --> 06:05:46,300
cooking again,

5574
06:05:46,300 --> 06:05:48,300
because we're going to need a,

5575
06:05:48,300 --> 06:05:50,300
if we're wanting to wrap it up in a month,

5576
06:05:50,300 --> 06:05:53,300
I'm definitely going to need to stop getting so distracted.

5577
06:05:53,300 --> 06:05:55,300
We'll do some cooking.

5578
06:05:55,300 --> 06:05:57,300
Oh, the refling's out the pen.

5579
06:05:57,300 --> 06:05:59,300
And then I'll walk again.

5580
06:05:59,300 --> 06:06:02,300
Right, where the heck is Ernest the chicken?

5581
06:06:02,300 --> 06:06:04,300
Uh,

5582
06:06:09,300 --> 06:06:11,300
Starting off.

5583
06:06:11,300 --> 06:06:12,300
Four quest points.

5584
06:06:12,300 --> 06:06:14,300
Oh, that's the rewards.

5585
06:06:14,300 --> 06:06:18,300
Able to survive a skeleton level 22 attacking you.

5586
06:06:18,300 --> 06:06:21,300
Surely we're leveled up enough.

5587
06:06:21,300 --> 06:06:23,300
Surely.

5588
06:06:24,300 --> 06:06:27,300
Talk to Veronica outside of Draynor Manor.

5589
06:06:27,300 --> 06:06:29,300
Blah, where is it?

5590
06:06:29,300 --> 06:06:31,300
On the map.

5591
06:06:32,300 --> 06:06:34,300
Draynor Manor.

5592
06:06:34,300 --> 06:06:36,300
Draynor Village.

5593
06:06:36,300 --> 06:06:38,300
Oh, it was like outside that creepy place.

5594
06:06:38,300 --> 06:06:39,300
Yeah, here.

5595
06:06:39,300 --> 06:06:40,300
Okay, okay.

5596
06:06:40,300 --> 06:06:42,300
So how do we progress?

5597
06:06:42,300 --> 06:06:43,300
We go across the bridge,

5598
06:06:43,300 --> 06:06:44,300
and we go up,

5599
06:06:44,300 --> 06:06:46,300
and then we just keep going along,

5600
06:06:46,300 --> 06:06:48,300
and then we can go up again past the window.

5601
06:06:48,300 --> 06:06:49,300
Okay.

5602
06:06:49,300 --> 06:06:51,300
I shall take a breath and break.

5603
06:06:51,300 --> 06:06:52,300
Don't get me.

5604
06:06:52,300 --> 06:06:53,300
Oh, no.

5605
06:06:53,300 --> 06:06:54,300
Wait.

5606
06:06:54,300 --> 06:06:55,300
Okay.

5607
06:06:55,300 --> 06:06:57,300
If you want to follow me,

5608
06:06:57,300 --> 06:06:59,300
if you want to follow me refling,

5609
06:06:59,300 --> 06:07:01,300
is there anyone who's left behind?

5610
06:07:01,300 --> 06:07:02,300
You're not.

5611
06:07:02,300 --> 06:07:04,300
I don't recognize you as a refling.

5612
06:07:04,300 --> 06:07:07,300
There's a refling getting beaten up by a cow right now.

5613
06:07:07,300 --> 06:07:09,300
But reflings come outside the pen,

5614
06:07:09,300 --> 06:07:11,300
and you can follow me with a golden heart.

5615
06:07:11,300 --> 06:07:13,300
I crafted the schemata and shielded myself.

5616
06:07:13,300 --> 06:07:15,300
Heck yeah.

5617
06:07:15,300 --> 06:07:20,300
Not all the reflings like watching this one refling be up a cow.

5618
06:07:22,300 --> 06:07:23,300
I'm trying.

5619
06:07:24,300 --> 06:07:26,300
Don't actually worry if I get stuck.

5620
06:07:26,300 --> 06:07:27,300
I'll catch up.

5621
06:07:27,300 --> 06:07:30,300
Who is this Shirley you keep talking about?

5622
06:07:30,300 --> 06:07:32,300
It's me seeing Shirley.

5623
06:07:34,300 --> 06:07:35,300
Okay, there.

5624
06:07:35,300 --> 06:07:36,300
Refling.

5625
06:07:36,300 --> 06:07:37,300
Is there any other refling?

5626
06:07:37,300 --> 06:07:38,300
I don't know.

5627
06:07:38,300 --> 06:07:40,300
Render distance isn't helping.

5628
06:07:40,300 --> 06:07:42,300
I think that's just natural.

5629
06:07:42,300 --> 06:07:43,300
Okay, let's...

5630
06:07:43,300 --> 06:07:44,300
If you want to follow me,

5631
06:07:44,300 --> 06:07:45,300
I have the golden heart.

5632
06:07:45,300 --> 06:07:48,300
I'm going to be very careful with my pathing.

5633
06:07:48,300 --> 06:07:50,300
Maybe you can follow me.

5634
06:07:51,300 --> 06:07:53,300
Choo choo all aboard.

5635
06:07:58,300 --> 06:07:59,300
I made it to level four.

5636
06:07:59,300 --> 06:08:00,300
Wish me luck.

5637
06:08:00,300 --> 06:08:01,300
We're getting there.

5638
06:08:01,300 --> 06:08:02,300
We're getting there.

5639
06:08:02,300 --> 06:08:05,300
We'll definitely maybe do a bit of combat training.

5640
06:08:07,300 --> 06:08:08,300
But yeah.

5641
06:08:09,300 --> 06:08:11,300
All aboard.

5642
06:08:16,300 --> 06:08:18,300
I'll just kind of click one by one

5643
06:08:18,300 --> 06:08:23,300
to make sure we don't get any actually stuck on something.

5644
06:08:26,300 --> 06:08:28,300
How many reflings do we have in game?

5645
06:08:29,300 --> 06:08:33,300
I don't actually know how many.

5646
06:08:33,300 --> 06:08:35,300
We've had a few went offline

5647
06:08:35,300 --> 06:08:37,300
because we have hit the six hour mark.

5648
06:08:40,300 --> 06:08:44,300
But we do have a good amount of reflings all hanging out.

5649
06:08:44,300 --> 06:08:46,300
We are going to do cooking though.

5650
06:08:46,300 --> 06:08:47,300
I need to cook.

5651
06:08:47,300 --> 06:08:48,300
Jesse.

5652
06:08:49,300 --> 06:08:50,300
We need to cook.

5653
06:08:51,300 --> 06:08:52,300
Refling.

5654
06:08:52,300 --> 06:08:53,300
We need to cook.

5655
06:08:53,300 --> 06:08:54,300
Okay, I'm following the bunny.

5656
06:08:54,300 --> 06:08:56,300
Honestly, I should just follow the bunny.

5657
06:08:58,300 --> 06:09:00,300
Right, we're just going to follow report.

5658
06:09:00,300 --> 06:09:01,300
Follow.

5659
06:09:02,300 --> 06:09:04,300
Wait, wasn't the bunny the one that gave me the poison?

5660
06:09:04,300 --> 06:09:06,300
Why would I follow the bunny?

5661
06:09:08,300 --> 06:09:10,300
Hope I can join in next time.

5662
06:09:10,300 --> 06:09:11,300
Absolutely.

5663
06:09:12,300 --> 06:09:13,300
Absolutely.

5664
06:09:13,300 --> 06:09:14,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5665
06:09:14,300 --> 06:09:15,300
Oh, scary.

5666
06:09:15,300 --> 06:09:16,300
Oh, no!

5667
06:09:16,300 --> 06:09:17,300
It doesn't go stuck.

5668
06:09:18,300 --> 06:09:19,300
Oh, no, refling's there.

5669
06:09:19,300 --> 06:09:20,300
I was an AFK refling.

5670
06:09:20,300 --> 06:09:21,300
Okay.

5671
06:09:22,300 --> 06:09:23,300
If you want to see where we are,

5672
06:09:23,300 --> 06:09:24,300
we're in world three AA

5673
06:09:24,300 --> 06:09:26,300
and we're outside the creepy,

5674
06:09:26,300 --> 06:09:28,300
creepy drain or manner.

5675
06:09:28,300 --> 06:09:31,300
Now, apparently we can get hurt in here.

5676
06:09:31,300 --> 06:09:33,300
So if anyone doesn't have food,

5677
06:09:33,300 --> 06:09:34,300
do you want to trade me

5678
06:09:34,300 --> 06:09:36,300
and I'll share my food with you?

5679
06:09:38,300 --> 06:09:40,300
If you send a trade offer,

5680
06:09:40,300 --> 06:09:41,300
I'll give you some food

5681
06:09:41,300 --> 06:09:42,300
because apparently we can get hurt.

5682
06:09:42,300 --> 06:09:43,300
But I think we can run away.

5683
06:09:43,300 --> 06:09:45,300
We just need to run away.

5684
06:09:46,300 --> 06:09:47,300
That's all.

5685
06:09:48,300 --> 06:09:49,300
I crashed.

5686
06:09:49,300 --> 06:09:50,300
Time to head back in game.

5687
06:09:51,300 --> 06:09:53,300
The forest is pretty scary.

5688
06:09:53,300 --> 06:09:54,300
Okay, we got a light.

5689
06:09:55,300 --> 06:09:56,300
Follow the bunny.

5690
06:09:56,300 --> 06:09:57,300
Last time I did that,

5691
06:09:57,300 --> 06:09:58,300
I found myself in Wonderland.

5692
06:10:00,300 --> 06:10:02,300
Okay, this refling needs some food.

5693
06:10:02,300 --> 06:10:03,300
Here you go.

5694
06:10:06,300 --> 06:10:07,300
Is there another?

5695
06:10:07,300 --> 06:10:08,300
Or has everyone got food?

5696
06:10:08,300 --> 06:10:09,300
Did you all cook meat?

5697
06:10:09,300 --> 06:10:11,300
I think you all must have cooked meat, yeah.

5698
06:10:11,300 --> 06:10:12,300
Oh, there's fires to cook meat

5699
06:10:12,300 --> 06:10:14,300
if you picked up meat from the coals.

5700
06:10:16,300 --> 06:10:18,300
Only now I notice that the strange

5701
06:10:18,300 --> 06:10:20,300
horse head refling

5702
06:10:20,300 --> 06:10:22,300
that walks strangely is no more there.

5703
06:10:22,300 --> 06:10:24,300
We are safe for now

5704
06:10:24,300 --> 06:10:26,300
from the strange walking refling.

5705
06:10:26,300 --> 06:10:28,300
We've got someone giving us a gluck gluck

5706
06:10:28,300 --> 06:10:29,300
outside the gates.

5707
06:10:31,300 --> 06:10:33,300
Been cooking the coos, right?

5708
06:10:33,300 --> 06:10:35,300
Okay, I don't know what happens here.

5709
06:10:35,300 --> 06:10:37,300
But I think the forest attacked...

5710
06:10:37,300 --> 06:10:38,300
Oh, wait, wait!

5711
06:10:38,300 --> 06:10:39,300
Sorry, sorry.

5712
06:10:39,300 --> 06:10:40,300
The quest is out here.

5713
06:10:40,300 --> 06:10:41,300
Talk to the lady here.

5714
06:10:41,300 --> 06:10:42,300
Sorry, talk to the lady.

5715
06:10:42,300 --> 06:10:43,300
Talk to the lady at the door.

5716
06:10:43,300 --> 06:10:44,300
Can you please help me?

5717
06:10:44,300 --> 06:10:45,300
I'm in a terrible spot of trouble.

5718
06:10:45,300 --> 06:10:47,300
Start, Ernest, to chicken.

5719
06:10:47,300 --> 06:10:48,300
Absolutely.

5720
06:10:48,300 --> 06:10:49,300
Ah, sounds like a quest.

5721
06:10:49,300 --> 06:10:50,300
I'll help.

5722
06:10:50,300 --> 06:10:51,300
Yes, yes.

5723
06:10:51,300 --> 06:10:52,300
I suppose is a quest.

5724
06:10:52,300 --> 06:10:54,300
My fiancee Ernest and I came to this hoose.

5725
06:10:54,300 --> 06:10:56,300
Seeing that we were a little lost,

5726
06:10:56,300 --> 06:10:59,300
Ernest decided to go in and ask for directions.

5727
06:10:59,300 --> 06:11:00,300
That was an hour ago.

5728
06:11:00,300 --> 06:11:01,300
This house looks spooky.

5729
06:11:01,300 --> 06:11:03,300
Can you see if you can find it for me?

5730
06:11:04,300 --> 06:11:05,300
I'll see what I can do.

5731
06:11:07,300 --> 06:11:08,300
Thank you, thank you.

5732
06:11:08,300 --> 06:11:09,300
I'm very grateful.

5733
06:11:09,300 --> 06:11:10,300
Okay, what are we?

5734
06:11:10,300 --> 06:11:12,300
Did we go inside now?

5735
06:11:12,300 --> 06:11:13,300
I'm scared.

5736
06:11:14,300 --> 06:11:17,300
All right, open the large door.

5737
06:11:17,300 --> 06:11:18,300
Oh, wait!

5738
06:11:18,300 --> 06:11:19,300
Requirements for the quest.

5739
06:11:19,300 --> 06:11:21,300
You need poison and fish food.

5740
06:11:21,300 --> 06:11:22,300
Oh, no!

5741
06:11:22,300 --> 06:11:24,300
Where do you get poison and fish food?

5742
06:11:26,300 --> 06:11:27,300
For the other reflins.

5743
06:11:27,300 --> 06:11:29,300
I thought you were being funny, other reflin.

5744
06:11:29,300 --> 06:11:30,300
I didn't realize.

5745
06:11:30,300 --> 06:11:32,300
Oh, wait, you're giving me something?

5746
06:11:32,300 --> 06:11:34,300
Why are you giving me?

5747
06:11:34,300 --> 06:11:36,300
Is that a boat plug?

5748
06:11:38,300 --> 06:11:39,300
A holy symbol.

5749
06:11:39,300 --> 06:11:41,300
What does it do?

5750
06:11:41,300 --> 06:11:42,300
I wear it.

5751
06:11:43,300 --> 06:11:44,300
It's like a star.

5752
06:11:45,300 --> 06:11:47,300
Anyone need poison or fish food?

5753
06:11:47,300 --> 06:11:49,300
Yeah, I thought that reflim was being funny,

5754
06:11:49,300 --> 06:11:50,300
giving me poison fish food.

5755
06:11:50,300 --> 06:11:52,300
Turns out it's actually for the quest.

5756
06:11:54,300 --> 06:11:56,300
That Samsung Galaxy Slurp.

5757
06:11:57,300 --> 06:11:59,300
My life can't handle another MMO

5758
06:11:59,300 --> 06:12:00,300
being through four in my life.

5759
06:12:00,300 --> 06:12:01,300
So this refling...

5760
06:12:02,300 --> 06:12:05,300
So this refling will just keep chat company.

5761
06:12:06,300 --> 06:12:08,300
We're only doing 99.

5762
06:12:08,300 --> 06:12:10,300
I don't know how to get poison or fish food.

5763
06:12:10,300 --> 06:12:12,300
There might be a refling that has enough supplies.

5764
06:12:13,300 --> 06:12:14,300
I didn't realize.

5765
06:12:14,300 --> 06:12:15,300
I never said.

5766
06:12:16,300 --> 06:12:17,300
I'm crazy.

5767
06:12:17,300 --> 06:12:19,300
Recommended items, none.

5768
06:12:19,300 --> 06:12:21,300
Or can you get them in the house?

5769
06:12:25,300 --> 06:12:28,300
There's a spawn for them, but they're very slow.

5770
06:12:28,300 --> 06:12:31,300
Okay, at least we can spawn the items.

5771
06:12:32,300 --> 06:12:33,300
In the house.

5772
06:12:34,300 --> 06:12:36,300
Right, I'm gonna very quickly go for a pee.

5773
06:12:36,300 --> 06:12:38,300
I don't know why I need to pee so much.

5774
06:12:38,300 --> 06:12:39,300
I think I'll make a tea as well.

5775
06:12:39,300 --> 06:12:41,300
Sorry, my voice is like really struggling.

5776
06:12:44,300 --> 06:12:47,300
I really want to stream for long.

5777
06:12:51,300 --> 06:12:54,300
I'm worried about how long I can last during my ASMR stream.

5778
06:12:55,300 --> 06:12:57,300
A little tinkle break, yeah.

5779
06:12:58,300 --> 06:12:59,300
A little tinkle-winkle.

5780
06:12:59,300 --> 06:13:01,300
The poison's in the house near the kitchen.

5781
06:13:01,300 --> 06:13:03,300
Okay, so at least we know the fish food

5782
06:13:03,300 --> 06:13:04,300
and the thing he does respawn.

5783
06:13:04,300 --> 06:13:05,300
I'm gonna make another tea.

5784
06:13:05,300 --> 06:13:07,300
I'm so sorry about all the breaks today.

5785
06:13:07,300 --> 06:13:08,300
It's my voice.

5786
06:13:09,300 --> 06:13:11,300
I'm getting, I'm getting nervous.

5787
06:13:11,300 --> 06:13:12,300
I'm not gonna be able to make it.

5788
06:13:12,300 --> 06:13:14,300
But for the ASMR and the sweet trying stream,

5789
06:13:14,300 --> 06:13:16,300
like, oh, sorry, I just stood on the mic.

5790
06:13:16,300 --> 06:13:17,300
Sorry about that.

5791
06:13:17,300 --> 06:13:19,300
I just absolutely obliterate your ears there.

5792
06:13:19,300 --> 06:13:20,300
Don't apologize.

5793
06:13:20,300 --> 06:13:21,300
I'll be back.

5794
06:13:21,300 --> 06:13:23,300
I'll literally be in a minute, okay?

5795
06:13:23,300 --> 06:13:24,300
To pee.

5796
06:14:11,300 --> 06:14:12,300
Yeah.

5797
06:14:41,300 --> 06:14:42,300
Yeah.

5798
06:15:11,300 --> 06:15:12,300
Yeah.

5799
06:15:41,300 --> 06:15:42,300
Yeah.

5800
06:16:11,300 --> 06:16:12,300
Yeah.

5801
06:16:41,300 --> 06:16:42,300
Yeah.

5802
06:17:11,300 --> 06:17:12,300
Yeah.

5803
06:17:41,300 --> 06:17:43,300
Yeah.

5804
06:18:11,300 --> 06:18:18,300
I don't know if it's a jumpscare when the tracking doesn't catch me coming into the room.

5805
06:18:18,300 --> 06:18:21,300
And I just unmute and I'm like, oh.

5806
06:18:21,300 --> 06:18:22,300
Oh.

5807
06:18:22,300 --> 06:18:23,300
Oh.

5808
06:18:23,300 --> 06:18:24,300
Oh.

5809
06:18:24,300 --> 06:18:25,300
Oh.

5810
06:18:25,300 --> 06:18:26,300
Oh.

5811
06:18:26,300 --> 06:18:27,300
Oh.

5812
06:18:27,300 --> 06:18:28,300
Oh.

5813
06:18:28,300 --> 06:18:29,300
Oh.

5814
06:18:29,300 --> 06:18:30,300
Oh.

5815
06:18:30,300 --> 06:18:31,300
Oh.

5816
06:18:31,300 --> 06:18:32,300
Oh.

5817
06:18:32,300 --> 06:18:33,300
Oh.

5818
06:18:33,300 --> 06:18:34,300
Oh.

5819
06:18:34,300 --> 06:18:35,300
Oh.

5820
06:18:35,300 --> 06:18:36,300
Oh.

5821
06:18:36,300 --> 06:18:37,300
Oh.

5822
06:18:37,300 --> 06:18:38,300
Oh.

5823
06:18:38,300 --> 06:18:39,300
Oh.

5824
06:18:39,300 --> 06:18:40,300
Oh.

5825
06:18:40,300 --> 06:18:41,300
Oh.

5826
06:18:41,300 --> 06:18:42,300
Oh.

5827
06:18:42,300 --> 06:18:43,300
Oh.

5828
06:18:43,300 --> 06:18:44,300
Oh.

5829
06:18:44,300 --> 06:18:45,300
Oh.

5830
06:18:45,300 --> 06:18:46,300
Oh.

5831
06:18:46,300 --> 06:18:47,300
You died.

5832
06:18:47,300 --> 06:18:50,300
Woman in the scar.

5833
06:18:50,300 --> 06:18:58,300
Why is it so loud in the music menu?

5834
06:18:58,300 --> 06:19:02,300
Thank goodness it doesn't link the details on the audio.

5835
06:19:02,300 --> 06:19:03,300
I think we're in skating with it.

5836
06:19:03,300 --> 06:19:06,300
Some people stream, what do you need?

5837
06:19:06,300 --> 06:19:08,300
Right.

5838
06:19:08,300 --> 06:19:10,300
an air nest.

5839
06:19:10,300 --> 06:19:12,300
Chang.

5840
06:19:12,300 --> 06:19:15,300
One refling went to go grab some spades for people who don't have one.

5841
06:19:15,300 --> 06:19:17,300
Oh sugar, I don't have a spade either.

5842
06:19:17,300 --> 06:19:19,300
Oh wait, what am I doing?

5843
06:19:19,300 --> 06:19:20,300
No, this one.

5844
06:19:20,300 --> 06:19:22,300
And then this one.

5845
06:19:24,300 --> 06:19:26,300
Uh, okay.

5846
06:19:26,300 --> 06:19:28,300
Are we waiting for spades?

5847
06:19:30,300 --> 06:19:32,300
Trade for spade!

5848
06:19:32,300 --> 06:19:34,300
Trade me! Trade mommy! Trade mommy!

5849
06:19:34,300 --> 06:19:36,300
Mommy needs a spade!

5850
06:19:36,300 --> 06:19:38,300
Just one, please.

5851
06:19:44,300 --> 06:19:46,300
I did make another spade.

5852
06:19:46,300 --> 06:19:48,300
I'm happy to say my pee was clear.

5853
06:19:48,300 --> 06:19:52,300
Um, I don't think I can do endurance.

5854
06:19:52,300 --> 06:19:54,300
My...

5855
06:19:54,300 --> 06:19:56,300
My throat is very sore right now.

5856
06:19:56,300 --> 06:20:00,300
It's very raw and it hurts, okay?

5857
06:20:00,300 --> 06:20:02,300
I'm needing your ink to help me

5858
06:20:02,300 --> 06:20:04,300
unironically soothe my throat.

5859
06:20:04,300 --> 06:20:06,300
So I think what the deal is

5860
06:20:06,300 --> 06:20:09,300
when Mercy goes live,

5861
06:20:09,300 --> 06:20:13,300
which is in T-minus

5862
06:20:13,300 --> 06:20:18,300
two and a half hours for snippets,

5863
06:20:18,300 --> 06:20:20,300
we'll raid into her.

5864
06:20:20,300 --> 06:20:22,300
If that's okay.

5865
06:20:22,300 --> 06:20:24,300
Um, there's a spade inside as well.

5866
06:20:24,300 --> 06:20:25,300
Just woke up. How's runes keep going?

5867
06:20:25,300 --> 06:20:27,300
It's going good!

5868
06:20:27,300 --> 06:20:29,300
Um, sadly my voice can't keep up.

5869
06:20:29,300 --> 06:20:31,300
This is when I get really frustrated for streaming.

5870
06:20:31,300 --> 06:20:33,300
I could happily stream 12 hours right now.

5871
06:20:34,300 --> 06:20:36,300
But it really hurts.

5872
06:20:36,300 --> 06:20:39,300
Okay, dropping some poison and fish food.

5873
06:20:39,300 --> 06:20:41,300
Okay, we'll wait until it loads up.

5874
06:20:44,300 --> 06:20:46,300
Honey, ink, tea, honestly.

5875
06:20:46,300 --> 06:20:48,300
Mercy's in two hours, yeah.

5876
06:20:48,300 --> 06:20:50,300
Oh good, been having tons of fun

5877
06:20:50,300 --> 06:20:53,300
and it's already a long stream, don't feel bad, yeah.

5878
06:20:53,300 --> 06:20:55,300
What do you mean? This is a baby stream for me?

5879
06:20:55,300 --> 06:20:56,300
Are you joking me?

5880
06:20:56,300 --> 06:20:58,300
Literally a two hour stream,

5881
06:20:58,300 --> 06:21:00,300
which is like the average for a VTuber,

5882
06:21:00,300 --> 06:21:02,300
is like a millisecond in my time.

5883
06:21:03,300 --> 06:21:05,300
Like, oh, I feel so bad.

5884
06:21:05,300 --> 06:21:07,300
I'm only going to stream eight hours today.

5885
06:21:07,300 --> 06:21:08,300
Ah!

5886
06:21:08,300 --> 06:21:11,300
I mean, what do you mean I got to play a multiplayer game

5887
06:21:11,300 --> 06:21:13,300
with quite literally, like,

5888
06:21:13,300 --> 06:21:17,300
how freaking blessed is it to be able to play a multiplayer game

5889
06:21:17,300 --> 06:21:19,300
with Reeflings live

5890
06:21:19,300 --> 06:21:21,300
whilst we're having a carry-on,

5891
06:21:21,300 --> 06:21:23,300
just meme-ing about freaking doing head-banging,

5892
06:21:23,300 --> 06:21:25,300
like, I've been dripped out,

5893
06:21:25,300 --> 06:21:27,300
I've been getting gifts and stuff,

5894
06:21:27,300 --> 06:21:29,300
people giving money, like,

5895
06:21:29,300 --> 06:21:31,300
it's not a job!

5896
06:21:31,300 --> 06:21:33,300
Like, this is fun!

5897
06:21:33,300 --> 06:21:35,300
Like, I'm having so much fun!

5898
06:21:36,300 --> 06:21:38,300
Ugh, I wish there was some sort of secret

5899
06:21:38,300 --> 06:21:41,300
to, like, fixing, like, my voice from vocal strain,

5900
06:21:41,300 --> 06:21:43,300
but the sad secret is it's literally just

5901
06:21:43,300 --> 06:21:45,300
shut up, stop talking.

5902
06:21:45,300 --> 06:21:47,300
Ugh, which is so annoying.

5903
06:21:49,300 --> 06:21:51,300
Better to end early than strain your throat.

5904
06:21:51,300 --> 06:21:53,300
I mean, it's already strained right now, but, uh...

5905
06:21:54,300 --> 06:21:56,300
What do you mean, multiplayer-to-ever talk,

5906
06:21:56,300 --> 06:21:58,300
yapping sessions, honestly,

5907
06:21:58,300 --> 06:22:00,300
is just yap, yap, yap.

5908
06:22:00,300 --> 06:22:02,300
We got a little spooky boy!

5909
06:22:02,300 --> 06:22:04,300
Spooky, spooky, bump again!

5910
06:22:05,300 --> 06:22:07,300
You're so misunderstood.

5911
06:22:07,300 --> 06:22:09,300
Oh, did you like Emmy's cover?

5912
06:22:09,300 --> 06:22:10,300
No.

5913
06:22:10,300 --> 06:22:11,300
Mo!

5914
06:22:11,300 --> 06:22:13,300
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

5915
06:22:13,300 --> 06:22:14,300
Oh, it's in a mo!

5916
06:22:14,300 --> 06:22:15,300
Oh, you're yawning just head off!

5917
06:22:15,300 --> 06:22:16,300
Oh, that's hilarious.

5918
06:22:16,300 --> 06:22:18,300
I'm waiting for the fish food to load,

5919
06:22:18,300 --> 06:22:20,300
so the others can grab it,

5920
06:22:20,300 --> 06:22:22,300
but I actually don't see it loading.

5921
06:22:23,300 --> 06:22:25,300
Having so much fun just hanging out at the Reeflings,

5922
06:22:25,300 --> 06:22:27,300
have all of the quests done already?

5923
06:22:27,300 --> 06:22:29,300
No, the quests are not done, please don't worry,

5924
06:22:29,300 --> 06:22:31,300
we're doing the free quest,

5925
06:22:31,300 --> 06:22:33,300
Erin is the chicken at the moment.

5926
06:22:33,300 --> 06:22:34,300
We've done a hand...

5927
06:22:34,300 --> 06:22:36,300
Oh, I've got my BS forehead in the way,

5928
06:22:36,300 --> 06:22:38,300
hold on, let me just close this for a second.

5929
06:22:38,300 --> 06:22:40,300
Here is all the quests we've done,

5930
06:22:40,300 --> 06:22:42,300
so free quests, we've done Cook's Assistant,

5931
06:22:42,300 --> 06:22:44,300
we're doing Big Erin Ease,

5932
06:22:44,300 --> 06:22:46,300
the chicken right now.

5933
06:22:46,300 --> 06:22:48,300
We did the mystery,

5934
06:22:48,300 --> 06:22:50,300
the restless ghost Romeo and Juliet,

5935
06:22:50,300 --> 06:22:53,300
Sheepshearer, X marks the spot,

5936
06:22:53,300 --> 06:22:55,300
we're finishing Erin is the chicken,

5937
06:22:55,300 --> 06:22:57,300
and then we're going back to update,

5938
06:22:57,300 --> 06:22:59,300
to grind on our cooking stats.

5939
06:23:00,300 --> 06:23:03,300
Can't expect you to do constant endurance streams day after day,

5940
06:23:03,300 --> 06:23:05,300
sadly I hate it,

5941
06:23:05,300 --> 06:23:07,300
I don't like doing short streams,

5942
06:23:07,300 --> 06:23:09,300
I just feel so like...

5943
06:23:09,300 --> 06:23:11,300
I don't know what the word is,

5944
06:23:11,300 --> 06:23:16,300
I have been yearning for this day,

5945
06:23:16,300 --> 06:23:18,300
for an entire year,

5946
06:23:18,300 --> 06:23:21,300
for this time, sorry, not for this day in particular,

5947
06:23:21,300 --> 06:23:23,300
but for this time,

5948
06:23:23,300 --> 06:23:26,300
and it's just like...

5949
06:23:26,300 --> 06:23:30,300
It's frustrating that the only reason I can't stream more

5950
06:23:30,300 --> 06:23:31,300
is because of my voice,

5951
06:23:31,300 --> 06:23:33,300
and not because I'm tired,

5952
06:23:33,300 --> 06:23:34,300
or I don't feel well,

5953
06:23:34,300 --> 06:23:35,300
or I don't want to type thing,

5954
06:23:35,300 --> 06:23:36,300
it's frustrating,

5955
06:23:36,300 --> 06:23:38,300
it's my voice.

5956
06:23:38,300 --> 06:23:39,300
That's it.

5957
06:23:39,300 --> 06:23:42,300
That's the only reason I can't stream for long,

5958
06:23:42,300 --> 06:23:45,300
because it hurts to talk right now.

5959
06:23:47,300 --> 06:23:49,300
Jesus, you haven't seen the whole song!

5960
06:23:51,300 --> 06:23:53,300
Try to live up to the name, you know?

5961
06:23:54,300 --> 06:23:55,300
Maybe.

5962
06:23:55,300 --> 06:23:57,300
I asked for a little bit off the top.

5963
06:23:57,300 --> 06:23:59,300
Hey, yo, who's the barber?

5964
06:24:00,300 --> 06:24:01,300
Man, we gotta go both.

5965
06:24:01,300 --> 06:24:03,300
Okay, the poison isn't loading on the floor for me,

5966
06:24:03,300 --> 06:24:05,300
but I think we'll do it,

5967
06:24:05,300 --> 06:24:07,300
so as long as you guys have accepted the quest,

5968
06:24:07,300 --> 06:24:10,300
we're gonna go inside now, reflings.

5969
06:24:10,300 --> 06:24:12,300
It's taking nice and slow.

5970
06:24:12,300 --> 06:24:14,300
I think the trees hit you on the way past,

5971
06:24:14,300 --> 06:24:17,300
so just be careful you don't stray from the path too much.

5972
06:24:17,300 --> 06:24:19,300
Assumers supposed to go...

5973
06:24:19,300 --> 06:24:21,300
Ah, the tree frickin' went for me.

5974
06:24:21,300 --> 06:24:23,300
Open large door.

5975
06:24:23,300 --> 06:24:25,300
Okay.

5976
06:24:27,300 --> 06:24:29,300
Oh, there's like haunted things.

5977
06:24:29,300 --> 06:24:31,300
Where are we supposed to go?

5978
06:24:31,300 --> 06:24:33,300
Get the gauge and tube.

5979
06:24:33,300 --> 06:24:35,300
Where is that?

5980
06:24:37,300 --> 06:24:39,300
And not here, maybe it's upstairs?

5981
06:24:42,300 --> 06:24:44,300
Okay, we...

5982
06:24:44,300 --> 06:24:46,300
I'm gonna wait until...

5983
06:24:47,300 --> 06:24:49,300
Oh, that's not good.

5984
06:24:49,300 --> 06:24:52,300
Wait, I'm just gonna check how the reflings made it in.

5985
06:24:52,300 --> 06:24:55,300
Go up the stairs, reflings, when you come inside.

5986
06:24:56,300 --> 06:24:58,300
Is that the last refling?

5987
06:25:03,300 --> 06:25:05,300
Who's that?

5988
06:25:05,300 --> 06:25:07,300
I think that's the last refling.

5989
06:25:07,300 --> 06:25:09,300
We all need to go upstairs.

5990
06:25:10,300 --> 06:25:12,300
How are you even there?

5991
06:25:12,300 --> 06:25:13,300
The chair's attacking him!

5992
06:25:13,300 --> 06:25:15,300
Oh my god, that chair being yours!

5993
06:25:20,300 --> 06:25:21,300
Okay, that...

5994
06:25:21,300 --> 06:25:22,300
Is there no refling there?

5995
06:25:22,300 --> 06:25:24,300
Oh, I'll go up the stairs.

5996
06:25:26,300 --> 06:25:27,300
Oh, he like...

5997
06:25:27,300 --> 06:25:28,300
Oh, someone's beating them up.

5998
06:25:28,300 --> 06:25:29,300
Wait, where are we supposed to go?

5999
06:25:29,300 --> 06:25:30,300
Up here?

6000
06:25:30,300 --> 06:25:32,300
Up these stairs to the left?

6001
06:25:32,300 --> 06:25:34,300
As soon as we come up?

6002
06:25:36,300 --> 06:25:38,300
Nothing's being highlighted for me.

6003
06:25:38,300 --> 06:25:40,300
Runlight, you're failing me!

6004
06:25:40,300 --> 06:25:41,300
Am I supposed to go here?

6005
06:25:41,300 --> 06:25:43,300
Talk to the professor?

6006
06:25:46,300 --> 06:25:48,300
Be careful, there's lots of things...

6007
06:25:48,300 --> 06:25:49,300
Brian!

6008
06:25:49,300 --> 06:25:52,300
It frustrates you because you can't control it

6009
06:25:52,300 --> 06:25:54,300
and that's the most frustrating thing.

6010
06:25:54,300 --> 06:25:56,300
Not being able to control something.

6011
06:25:56,300 --> 06:25:57,300
That's right.

6012
06:25:57,300 --> 06:25:58,300
Thank you, Iron Looper.

6013
06:25:58,300 --> 06:25:59,300
For the tip.

6014
06:25:59,300 --> 06:26:01,300
And yeah, just like...

6015
06:26:01,300 --> 06:26:03,300
Runlight is telling you to use...

6016
06:26:06,300 --> 06:26:07,300
Wait, hold on.

6017
06:26:07,300 --> 06:26:09,300
Oh no, I'm messing up.

6018
06:26:09,300 --> 06:26:11,300
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

6019
06:26:14,300 --> 06:26:15,300
That's not so easy.

6020
06:26:15,300 --> 06:26:16,300
Well, look at them.

6021
06:26:17,300 --> 06:26:19,300
Oh, maybe I should be reading that out.

6022
06:26:19,300 --> 06:26:20,300
What would that say?

6023
06:26:20,300 --> 06:26:23,300
Runlight is telling you to use your poison on your fish food.

6024
06:26:23,300 --> 06:26:24,300
Okay.

6025
06:26:24,300 --> 06:26:26,300
Okay, I have poison fish food.

6026
06:26:26,300 --> 06:26:28,300
Wait, never mind.

6027
06:26:29,300 --> 06:26:30,300
Just hypnotize yourself.

6028
06:26:30,300 --> 06:26:32,300
Strongly trust me, I love you and enjoy every second,

6029
06:26:32,300 --> 06:26:34,300
but your health is important.

6030
06:26:34,300 --> 06:26:36,300
Yeah, like, as long as my voice doesn't break,

6031
06:26:36,300 --> 06:26:37,300
then I'm good to go.

6032
06:26:37,300 --> 06:26:39,300
In my pain.

6033
06:26:39,300 --> 06:26:40,300
Where...

6034
06:26:40,300 --> 06:26:43,300
Where is this freaking map telling me to go?

6035
06:26:43,300 --> 06:26:44,300
I'm so confused.

6036
06:26:44,300 --> 06:26:45,300
I wanna go.

6037
06:26:47,300 --> 06:26:49,300
We were to go outside?

6038
06:26:49,300 --> 06:26:51,300
Oh, right, okay.

6039
06:26:52,300 --> 06:26:53,300
Oh, no, sorry.

6040
06:26:53,300 --> 06:26:55,300
Close the map, not close.

6041
06:26:56,300 --> 06:26:58,300
Right, so go downstairs.

6042
06:27:01,300 --> 06:27:03,300
Okay, come downstairs.

6043
06:27:04,300 --> 06:27:07,300
Poison the fish food and then come back out of the mansion.

6044
06:27:09,300 --> 06:27:10,300
Okay.

6045
06:27:10,300 --> 06:27:12,300
Oh, this is a rough one to do together, I think,

6046
06:27:12,300 --> 06:27:14,300
so if you've not got...

6047
06:27:14,300 --> 06:27:16,300
The door won't open.

6048
06:27:16,300 --> 06:27:18,300
Over here.

6049
06:27:18,300 --> 06:27:19,300
Okay, okay, okay.

6050
06:27:19,300 --> 06:27:21,300
How do I get over there?

6051
06:27:22,300 --> 06:27:24,300
Wait, open the door.

6052
06:27:24,300 --> 06:27:25,300
The chair beating you up?

6053
06:27:25,300 --> 06:27:26,300
Oh, no, they just run around.

6054
06:27:26,300 --> 06:27:27,300
I thought the chair was like,

6055
06:27:27,300 --> 06:27:29,300
beat you up in the game on my cheek.

6056
06:27:33,300 --> 06:27:35,300
Oh, there's a rubber tube.

6057
06:27:35,300 --> 06:27:36,300
I get it.

6058
06:27:36,300 --> 06:27:38,300
Get the gauge in the tube.

6059
06:27:38,300 --> 06:27:39,300
Oh, my God.

6060
06:27:39,300 --> 06:27:41,300
Open the door.

6061
06:27:41,300 --> 06:27:43,300
What's that?

6062
06:27:44,300 --> 06:27:46,300
Oh, I'm actually kind of scared of that.

6063
06:27:47,300 --> 06:27:48,300
Wait, I can't go in.

6064
06:27:48,300 --> 06:27:49,300
The door's locked.

6065
06:27:49,300 --> 06:27:50,300
Oh, right, okay.

6066
06:27:52,300 --> 06:27:55,300
Someone's dropped a speed ahead if you need it, by the way.

6067
06:27:57,300 --> 06:27:59,300
But we're taking the long way around.

6068
06:28:02,300 --> 06:28:03,300
Okay, I'm glad the chairs don't beat you up

6069
06:28:03,300 --> 06:28:06,300
because, honestly, death by chair is pretty embarrassing.

6070
06:28:06,300 --> 06:28:08,300
Right, open the door.

6071
06:28:08,300 --> 06:28:11,300
Or I'm gonna throw rocks through your window.

6072
06:28:12,300 --> 06:28:14,300
Open the door.

6073
06:28:14,300 --> 06:28:17,300
Okay, so one by one door, but we can add it.

6074
06:28:17,300 --> 06:28:19,300
I need to get the key first.

6075
06:28:19,300 --> 06:28:20,300
Well, she's a stubborn one,

6076
06:28:20,300 --> 06:28:21,300
but I guess she keeps up till the day

6077
06:28:21,300 --> 06:28:22,300
she can take care of herself

6078
06:28:22,300 --> 06:28:24,300
to some fish so hard, man.

6079
06:28:26,300 --> 06:28:28,300
Okay, okay, we're now outside.

6080
06:28:28,300 --> 06:28:30,300
This is a very hard one to follow,

6081
06:28:30,300 --> 06:28:32,300
quest-wise.

6082
06:28:32,300 --> 06:28:34,300
Especially if you had a rune-like,

6083
06:28:34,300 --> 06:28:36,300
rune-crafting guild.

6084
06:28:36,300 --> 06:28:37,300
Stop.

6085
06:28:37,300 --> 06:28:40,300
Are you telling someone that we're rune-crafting guilds?

6086
06:28:41,300 --> 06:28:44,300
Okay, I'm just following the Easter bunny.

6087
06:28:44,300 --> 06:28:47,300
Follow the bunny, the bunny, the bunny.

6088
06:28:47,300 --> 06:28:49,300
Follow the Easter bunny.

6089
06:28:49,300 --> 06:28:51,300
To east, to east, to east.

6090
06:28:51,300 --> 06:28:53,300
Search compost heap.

6091
06:28:53,300 --> 06:28:54,300
Heap.

6092
06:28:54,300 --> 06:28:55,300
I love it.

6093
06:28:55,300 --> 06:28:57,300
A bit of cheeky vandalism.

6094
06:28:57,300 --> 06:28:58,300
Okay, we did it.

6095
06:28:58,300 --> 06:29:00,300
Oh, what did I do?

6096
06:29:00,300 --> 06:29:02,300
You find a small key.

6097
06:29:02,300 --> 06:29:04,300
Okay.

6098
06:29:04,300 --> 06:29:06,300
And now...

6099
06:29:07,300 --> 06:29:09,300
Okay.

6100
06:29:09,300 --> 06:29:11,300
Oh, there's a thing ahead.

6101
06:29:11,300 --> 06:29:13,300
Okay, there's a fountain ahead.

6102
06:29:13,300 --> 06:29:14,300
I don't know.

6103
06:29:14,300 --> 06:29:15,300
Has that already come to you?

6104
06:29:15,300 --> 06:29:16,300
I feel like...

6105
06:29:16,300 --> 06:29:18,300
I feel like someone's probably stuck in the house right now.

6106
06:29:18,300 --> 06:29:21,300
As long as you try and come outside, then you'll be fine.

6107
06:29:21,300 --> 06:29:23,300
So as long as you've all got the key,

6108
06:29:23,300 --> 06:29:25,300
come to the fountain next.

6109
06:29:25,300 --> 06:29:26,300
There's a fountain through the trees.

6110
06:29:26,300 --> 06:29:27,300
The trees might whip you,

6111
06:29:27,300 --> 06:29:29,300
but you should survive.

6112
06:29:29,300 --> 06:29:31,300
Like, it's literally one HP at least.

6113
06:29:31,300 --> 06:29:34,300
Poisoned fish food on the fountain.

6114
06:29:34,300 --> 06:29:36,300
Use on the fountain.

6115
06:29:36,300 --> 06:29:38,300
Oh, the tree just made a noise.

6116
06:29:39,300 --> 06:29:42,300
Use it on the fountain.

6117
06:29:42,300 --> 06:29:44,300
Okay.

6118
06:29:44,300 --> 06:29:46,300
The piranhas start eating the food,

6119
06:29:46,300 --> 06:29:49,300
then dine float to the surface.

6120
06:29:49,300 --> 06:29:51,300
And then search the fountain.

6121
06:29:51,300 --> 06:29:53,300
There seems to be a pressure gauge in here,

6122
06:29:53,300 --> 06:29:55,300
and a lot of dead fish.

6123
06:29:55,300 --> 06:29:57,300
Well, yeah, you just roll them,

6124
06:29:57,300 --> 06:29:59,300
smoke them.

6125
06:30:01,300 --> 06:30:02,300
Come outside.

6126
06:30:02,300 --> 06:30:05,300
Yes, I see, I see.

6127
06:30:05,300 --> 06:30:07,300
Okay, once we've all stopped

6128
06:30:07,300 --> 06:30:10,300
head banging into the fountain,

6129
06:30:10,300 --> 06:30:13,300
then we go back into the house.

6130
06:30:13,300 --> 06:30:16,300
Anyone got some spare poison fish?

6131
06:30:18,300 --> 06:30:21,300
Ah, the poison was in the house, I think.

6132
06:30:21,300 --> 06:30:23,300
Wait, we're outside the house.

6133
06:30:23,300 --> 06:30:24,300
How do we get back in?

6134
06:30:24,300 --> 06:30:27,300
Why is it making me go around in a circle?

6135
06:30:27,300 --> 06:30:30,300
I'm spinning around.

6136
06:30:30,300 --> 06:30:32,300
Get out of my way.

6137
06:30:33,300 --> 06:30:36,300
I didn't think for how much time

6138
06:30:36,300 --> 06:30:38,300
you prepared for this, by the way.

6139
06:30:38,300 --> 06:30:40,300
How is it, is it like you expected?

6140
06:30:40,300 --> 06:30:42,300
To me, you're having a lot of fun,

6141
06:30:42,300 --> 06:30:44,300
but maybe you have more to see.

6142
06:30:44,300 --> 06:30:45,300
On RuneScape?

6143
06:30:45,300 --> 06:30:46,300
I'm getting whipped by a tree.

6144
06:30:46,300 --> 06:30:48,300
Sorry, sorry, Ruflin's getting whipped by a tree

6145
06:30:48,300 --> 06:30:50,300
because of me, sorry.

6146
06:30:50,300 --> 06:30:52,300
I didn't mean RuneScape, it took a little second

6147
06:30:52,300 --> 06:30:54,300
to get ready to stream out.

6148
06:30:54,300 --> 06:30:56,300
I wasn't that bad.

6149
06:30:56,300 --> 06:30:58,300
Scale it in time, you just have to run in

6150
06:30:58,300 --> 06:31:00,300
and pick the tube, then run out.

6151
06:31:00,300 --> 06:31:02,300
Make it in turns, who wants to go first?

6152
06:31:04,300 --> 06:31:06,300
Ah, fuck it, I'll go first.

6153
06:31:06,300 --> 06:31:08,300
I need a lead by example.

6154
06:31:08,300 --> 06:31:10,300
Okay, grab the tube and then...

6155
06:31:10,300 --> 06:31:12,300
Okay, I got whacked for two,

6156
06:31:12,300 --> 06:31:14,300
so just make sure you get out in time.

6157
06:31:16,300 --> 06:31:18,300
Would you prefer to be whipped by a tree?

6158
06:31:18,300 --> 06:31:20,300
Is it instance,

6159
06:31:20,300 --> 06:31:22,300
or are we going to have to wait for that to reload?

6160
06:31:22,300 --> 06:31:24,300
Oh no, you've got it, you've got it.

6161
06:31:24,300 --> 06:31:25,300
Okay, that's fine.

6162
06:31:25,300 --> 06:31:26,300
Are you beating him up?

6163
06:31:26,300 --> 06:31:28,300
He said nah, hold on, let me do this,

6164
06:31:28,300 --> 06:31:30,300
Ruflin's like all this.

6165
06:31:30,300 --> 06:31:32,300
He's going to skillspec him, he's going to skillspec

6166
06:31:32,300 --> 06:31:34,300
he's going to do the little twirl thing.

6167
06:31:34,300 --> 06:31:36,300
Oh, streaming in general has been absolutely fantastic.

6168
06:31:36,300 --> 06:31:38,300
It's gone exactly the way I wanted it to.

6169
06:31:40,300 --> 06:31:42,300
I love streams, Nathan,

6170
06:31:42,300 --> 06:31:44,300
and I love long streams and yapping people's heads off

6171
06:31:44,300 --> 06:31:46,300
and it's just gone absolutely amazing.

6172
06:31:50,300 --> 06:31:52,300
Just fantastic.

6173
06:31:52,300 --> 06:31:54,300
For me, I don't like the mega

6174
06:31:54,300 --> 06:31:56,300
super professional streams, don't mind me.

6175
06:31:56,300 --> 06:31:58,300
Some people really like it.

6176
06:31:58,300 --> 06:32:00,300
Let's go, has everyone got it?

6177
06:32:02,300 --> 06:32:04,300
Thank you, Ruflin, for killing the skelly boy.

6178
06:32:04,300 --> 06:32:06,300
Has everyone got the rubber tube?

6179
06:32:08,300 --> 06:32:10,300
I don't think everyone's got it.

6180
06:32:10,300 --> 06:32:12,300
I don't know if it's been a bit funny,

6181
06:32:12,300 --> 06:32:14,300
but you should be able to go in and get the rubber tube

6182
06:32:14,300 --> 06:32:16,300
now that you've got the key.

6183
06:32:18,300 --> 06:32:20,300
Oh, someone's getting attacked over there.

6184
06:32:20,300 --> 06:32:22,300
Is there a Rufling? Oh, I thought a Ruflin just perished there.

6185
06:32:22,300 --> 06:32:24,300
Ruflin just perished there.

6186
06:32:24,300 --> 06:32:26,300
I'm happy to hear that, yeah.

6187
06:32:28,300 --> 06:32:30,300
There is nothing like a professional stream.

6188
06:32:30,300 --> 06:32:32,300
Where's the fish food?

6189
06:32:40,300 --> 06:32:42,300
Upstairs is the fish food reefling,

6190
06:32:42,300 --> 06:32:44,300
someone says.

6191
06:32:46,300 --> 06:32:48,300
I'll wait here until the other reeflings are caught

6192
06:32:48,300 --> 06:32:50,300
because it's not fair to skip ahead.

6193
06:32:50,300 --> 06:32:52,300
I like when funny Scott women yank to me for hours.

6194
06:32:52,300 --> 06:32:54,300
Simple as, nothing more.

6195
06:32:54,300 --> 06:32:56,300
Now, people really enjoy professional streams

6196
06:32:56,300 --> 06:32:58,300
from other people, which is great,

6197
06:32:58,300 --> 06:33:00,300
but for me, I'm just like...

6198
06:33:04,300 --> 06:33:06,300
It's the best I can say.

6199
06:33:08,300 --> 06:33:10,300
Oh, we're getting two head bang.

6200
06:33:10,300 --> 06:33:12,300
Yo, I'm starting to think this is getting...

6201
06:33:12,300 --> 06:33:14,300
Hold on, oh no, I can't wait, wait, let me zoom up a bit.

6202
06:33:14,300 --> 06:33:16,300
Let me take one more step

6203
06:33:16,300 --> 06:33:18,300
for no particular reason at all.

6204
06:33:18,300 --> 06:33:20,300
Okay, let me take one more step

6205
06:33:20,300 --> 06:33:22,300
for no particular reason at all.

6206
06:33:22,300 --> 06:33:24,300
Because it's absolutely no reason at all.

6207
06:33:30,300 --> 06:33:32,300
We are literal children, this is terrible.

6208
06:33:32,300 --> 06:33:34,300
That awful getting...

6209
06:33:34,300 --> 06:33:36,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey, he dancing on it,

6210
06:33:36,300 --> 06:33:38,300
he dancing on it, he doing the split on it.

6211
06:33:42,300 --> 06:33:44,300
I love your silly yapping.

6212
06:33:44,300 --> 06:33:46,300
Oh my God, a ghost is going for it.

6213
06:33:52,300 --> 06:33:54,300
Is there a refling on the outskirts?

6214
06:33:54,300 --> 06:33:56,300
Oh, I think I'm too far away to be able to see

6215
06:33:56,300 --> 06:33:58,300
if someone's at the compost heap right now.

6216
06:33:58,300 --> 06:34:00,300
Oh no, someone's getting beaten up.

6217
06:34:00,300 --> 06:34:02,300
Oh no, it's not him though.

6218
06:34:02,300 --> 06:34:04,300
I have salmon if you want it,

6219
06:34:04,300 --> 06:34:06,300
a refling that's literally protecting us all.

6220
06:34:08,300 --> 06:34:10,300
There's salmon juice, whoa, what is that?

6221
06:34:10,300 --> 06:34:12,300
Oh, is that for me?

6222
06:34:12,300 --> 06:34:14,300
Wait, should I do this in the middle?

6223
06:34:14,300 --> 06:34:16,300
I don't know what he does.

6224
06:34:16,300 --> 06:34:18,300
Scottlefish, are you there?

6225
06:34:18,300 --> 06:34:20,300
Should I do it or no?

6226
06:34:20,300 --> 06:34:22,300
I don't know if the old man's got a good quest or not.

6227
06:34:24,300 --> 06:34:26,300
Did I talk to him?

6228
06:34:28,300 --> 06:34:30,300
Do it, okay, someone says do it.

6229
06:34:30,300 --> 06:34:32,300
Oh, there you are, I hoped you would talk to me.

6230
06:34:32,300 --> 06:34:34,300
I get so lonely, I have a present, I must get going now.

6231
06:34:34,300 --> 06:34:36,300
Oh!

6232
06:34:36,300 --> 06:34:38,300
Oh, he just gave me an uncut emerald.

6233
06:34:38,300 --> 06:34:40,300
I didn't even ask anything.

6234
06:34:40,300 --> 06:34:42,300
I didn't even ask anything.

6235
06:34:42,300 --> 06:34:44,300
Oh, don't mind if I do,

6236
06:34:44,300 --> 06:34:46,300
I thought he was going to like whisk me away.

6237
06:34:46,300 --> 06:34:48,300
But he didn't.

6238
06:34:50,300 --> 06:34:52,300
Oh, I see the poison.

6239
06:34:52,300 --> 06:34:54,300
Whoa, poison's like 700.

6240
06:34:56,300 --> 06:34:58,300
Well, I know where the poison is,

6241
06:34:58,300 --> 06:35:00,300
if I don't need to know, it's by the left.

6242
06:35:00,300 --> 06:35:02,300
As you come in.

6243
06:35:04,300 --> 06:35:06,300
Does he need help?

6244
06:35:10,300 --> 06:35:12,300
Wow.

6245
06:35:14,300 --> 06:35:16,300
You wish to trade with me, what do you wish to trade?

6246
06:35:16,300 --> 06:35:18,300
Oh, you're giving it,

6247
06:35:18,300 --> 06:35:20,300
oh, the diamonds,

6248
06:35:22,300 --> 06:35:24,300
how you call them.

6249
06:35:24,300 --> 06:35:26,300
I don't know, the rocks in the ground.

6250
06:35:26,300 --> 06:35:28,300
What are these called? It's not jewelry.

6251
06:35:28,300 --> 06:35:30,300
But they're rocks.

6252
06:35:32,300 --> 06:35:34,300
What are diamonds category?

6253
06:35:34,300 --> 06:35:36,300
What are the category of ruby and plafa and that?

6254
06:35:36,300 --> 06:35:38,300
Gemstones!

6255
06:35:38,300 --> 06:35:40,300
Oh my god, I forgot that word there.

6256
06:35:40,300 --> 06:35:42,300
Jeez, low waist.

6257
06:35:42,300 --> 06:35:44,300
I literally forgot the word gems there.

6258
06:35:44,300 --> 06:35:46,300
I apologize.

6259
06:35:46,300 --> 06:35:48,300
Watch ads showed up tipped and left.

6260
06:35:48,300 --> 06:35:50,300
Or, yeah, or in gems.

6261
06:35:50,300 --> 06:35:52,300
I got out.

6262
06:35:52,300 --> 06:35:54,300
Oh god, we're all headbanging.

6263
06:35:54,300 --> 06:35:56,300
Are you practicing later?

6264
06:35:56,300 --> 06:35:58,300
For when the next 10 audios come out?

6265
06:35:58,300 --> 06:36:00,300
Wait, where is it? Headbanging?

6266
06:36:00,300 --> 06:36:02,300
Headbanging.

6267
06:36:02,300 --> 06:36:04,300
Oh my god, we really are a call.

6268
06:36:04,300 --> 06:36:06,300
Clearly, look at us go.

6269
06:36:12,300 --> 06:36:14,300
Oh, do you need, you need help,

6270
06:36:14,300 --> 06:36:16,300
holy crap you need help right now.

6271
06:36:16,300 --> 06:36:18,300
I've got salmon.

6272
06:36:18,300 --> 06:36:20,300
This should heal you up.

6273
06:36:22,300 --> 06:36:24,300
Go, go, go.

6274
06:36:24,300 --> 06:36:26,300
Is there any reeflings?

6275
06:36:26,300 --> 06:36:28,300
Oh no, they're self healing.

6276
06:36:28,300 --> 06:36:30,300
Is there any reeflings on the outskirts?

6277
06:36:30,300 --> 06:36:38,300
I can't really tell. I don't want to go ahead in case there's someone outside doing that. Fountain, but, um...

6278
06:36:40,300 --> 06:36:42,300
Is everyone here? Did we make it?

6279
06:36:42,300 --> 06:36:44,300
If there's a roofling, oh.

6280
06:36:44,300 --> 06:36:46,300
Who did that? Who did that?

6281
06:36:46,300 --> 06:36:48,300
That was you?

6282
06:36:48,300 --> 06:36:52,300
Okay, we're reporting you for harassment.

6283
06:36:52,300 --> 06:36:56,300
Interesting, we're in sync for me, but on stream.

6284
06:36:56,300 --> 06:36:59,300
My ping is really high to everyone.

6285
06:36:59,300 --> 06:37:03,300
They've had plenty of time. Yeah, is everyone here? I think so.

6286
06:37:03,300 --> 06:37:05,300
Hi hi, how's stream going?

6287
06:37:05,300 --> 06:37:08,300
It's been going amazing. Look at me and the roofling gang, we're doing questing.

6288
06:37:08,300 --> 06:37:11,300
Okay, I think everyone's got the plastic tube.

6289
06:37:11,300 --> 06:37:13,300
They get the gauge and tube.

6290
06:37:13,300 --> 06:37:15,300
Get the oil can next.

6291
06:37:15,300 --> 06:37:17,300
So, open this door.

6292
06:37:17,300 --> 06:37:19,300
We'll go through.

6293
06:37:19,300 --> 06:37:21,300
Okay.

6294
06:37:21,300 --> 06:37:23,300
I think we're all ready.

6295
06:37:23,300 --> 06:37:25,300
Okay.

6296
06:37:25,300 --> 06:37:28,300
Don't have the tube, but also got the gauge.

6297
06:37:28,300 --> 06:37:30,300
Wait, you don't have the tube?

6298
06:37:30,300 --> 06:37:32,300
No, I do have the tube.

6299
06:37:33,300 --> 06:37:36,300
Okay, we need to interact with this blue thing over here.

6300
06:37:36,300 --> 06:37:38,300
Wait, you've not got the tube?

6301
06:37:38,300 --> 06:37:40,300
Who's not got the tube?

6302
06:37:44,300 --> 06:37:47,300
Tube, you just run in and pick up when it spawns.

6303
06:37:49,300 --> 06:37:52,300
Go in the closet and get the rubber if you don't have...

6304
06:37:53,300 --> 06:37:55,300
I shouldn't have said that.

6305
06:37:57,300 --> 06:37:59,300
Oh my god, the shadow band GB's Twitter.

6306
06:37:59,300 --> 06:38:02,300
All of our Twitter's looks like a shadow band, it's ridiculous.

6307
06:38:02,300 --> 06:38:05,300
Like how sensitive it is.

6308
06:38:12,300 --> 06:38:14,300
Oh, what's that? It's a big thing.

6309
06:38:14,300 --> 06:38:16,300
Oh, it's gone.

6310
06:38:16,300 --> 06:38:18,300
Did they get the tube?

6311
06:38:18,300 --> 06:38:20,300
Did you get the tube? I think so.

6312
06:38:20,300 --> 06:38:22,300
All right, fun part of the quest. Let's go.

6313
06:38:22,300 --> 06:38:24,300
Let's go. Oh, the door...

6314
06:38:24,300 --> 06:38:26,300
The door's fine.

6315
06:38:26,300 --> 06:38:28,300
Hold on, sorry, I probably just closed that door on you.

6316
06:38:28,300 --> 06:38:30,300
Okay, search the bookcase.

6317
06:38:30,300 --> 06:38:32,300
Search the bookcase.

6318
06:38:32,300 --> 06:38:34,300
Oh, is that one by one?

6319
06:38:34,300 --> 06:38:36,300
Maybe a one by one moment. Hold on.

6320
06:38:36,300 --> 06:38:38,300
Hey, let's go.

6321
06:38:38,300 --> 06:38:40,300
Okay, go down the ladder.

6322
06:38:40,300 --> 06:38:42,300
Wait, go down the ladder when you're ready.

6323
06:38:42,300 --> 06:38:44,300
Is that everyone? Yeah, that's everyone.

6324
06:38:44,300 --> 06:38:46,300
Once you get through the bookshelf.

6325
06:38:46,300 --> 06:38:48,300
Okay, we did it.

6326
06:38:48,300 --> 06:38:50,300
The whole gang's here.

6327
06:38:50,300 --> 06:38:52,300
No replaying left behind.

6328
06:38:56,300 --> 06:38:58,300
Oh my god, we're beating up the rats, literally.

6329
06:38:58,300 --> 06:39:00,300
Oh god, what do we do?

6330
06:39:00,300 --> 06:39:02,300
Okay, there's a lever on the wall.

6331
06:39:02,300 --> 06:39:04,300
Pull lever alpha on the wall over here.

6332
06:39:06,300 --> 06:39:08,300
I assume this is going to be instanced to us.

6333
06:39:08,300 --> 06:39:10,300
So...

6334
06:39:10,300 --> 06:39:12,300
I don't know.

6335
06:39:12,300 --> 06:39:14,300
Then pull lever, bravo.

6336
06:39:14,300 --> 06:39:16,300
Oh, the music's all like...

6337
06:39:20,300 --> 06:39:22,300
Okay.

6338
06:39:22,300 --> 06:39:24,300
Now this gate is a jar.

6339
06:39:28,300 --> 06:39:30,300
And English, if it's like slightly open,

6340
06:39:30,300 --> 06:39:32,300
it's a jar.

6341
06:39:32,300 --> 06:39:34,300
Pull lever D.

6342
06:39:34,300 --> 06:39:36,300
Oh, I'll pull the D lever all day long.

6343
06:39:36,300 --> 06:39:38,300
Come over here, weak one.

6344
06:39:40,300 --> 06:39:42,300
What did that do?

6345
06:39:42,300 --> 06:39:44,300
Okay.

6346
06:39:46,300 --> 06:39:48,300
Oh god, it's a one by one gate.

6347
06:39:48,300 --> 06:39:50,300
Why is there a biggest issue right now?

6348
06:39:50,300 --> 06:39:52,300
One by one gate.

6349
06:39:56,300 --> 06:39:58,300
Oil can has a slow respawn as well.

6350
06:39:58,300 --> 06:40:00,300
I need an oil...

6351
06:40:00,300 --> 06:40:02,300
I think we all need an oil can.

6352
06:40:02,300 --> 06:40:04,300
So we're just going to have to go for it and be patient.

6353
06:40:04,300 --> 06:40:06,300
I'm sure you can wait.

6354
06:40:06,300 --> 06:40:08,300
I don't know if all the levers are the same for everyone.

6355
06:40:08,300 --> 06:40:10,300
It looks like you guys are going different ways.

6356
06:40:10,300 --> 06:40:12,300
So I think it might be different.

6357
06:40:18,300 --> 06:40:20,300
World hop when you get into the room

6358
06:40:20,300 --> 06:40:22,300
and then hop back.

6359
06:40:22,300 --> 06:40:24,300
Yeah, you guys are really going different ways for me.

6360
06:40:24,300 --> 06:40:26,300
So I think it's different for everyone.

6361
06:40:28,300 --> 06:40:30,300
Oh, the classic one by one gate.

6362
06:40:30,300 --> 06:40:32,300
It's over.

6363
06:40:32,300 --> 06:40:34,300
Lever solution is the same for everyone.

6364
06:40:34,300 --> 06:40:36,300
How's everyone going...

6365
06:40:36,300 --> 06:40:38,300
Are you guys...

6366
06:40:38,300 --> 06:40:40,300
Do you see this one?

6367
06:40:40,300 --> 06:40:42,300
That way everyone can grab it faster.

6368
06:40:42,300 --> 06:40:44,300
Yes.

6369
06:40:46,300 --> 06:40:48,300
Okay.

6370
06:40:48,300 --> 06:40:50,300
Okay.

6371
06:40:52,300 --> 06:40:54,300
Okay.

6372
06:40:54,300 --> 06:40:56,300
Okay, I love this runelight plugin

6373
06:40:56,300 --> 06:40:58,300
because if I had to do this

6374
06:40:58,300 --> 06:41:00,300
by my brain, it would be over.

6375
06:41:08,300 --> 06:41:10,300
This is crazy.

6376
06:41:14,300 --> 06:41:16,300
All levers are unique in their own way.

6377
06:41:16,300 --> 06:41:18,300
Exactly.

6378
06:41:18,300 --> 06:41:20,300
Wow.

6379
06:41:20,300 --> 06:41:22,300
Let's see.

6380
06:41:22,300 --> 06:41:24,300
Pull this lever.

6381
06:41:24,300 --> 06:41:26,300
We're almost done.

6382
06:41:26,300 --> 06:41:28,300
Okay, I was going to say that's like a lot of fricking questions.

6383
06:41:28,300 --> 06:41:30,300
Oh wait, sorry.

6384
06:41:30,300 --> 06:41:32,300
I'm going to see if my tea is at an acceptable temperature

6385
06:41:32,300 --> 06:41:34,300
if I'm going to scold myself on it.

6386
06:41:34,300 --> 06:41:36,300
That's why there's one or the other.

6387
06:41:36,300 --> 06:41:38,300
That was...

6388
06:41:44,300 --> 06:41:46,300
All these doors.

6389
06:41:46,300 --> 06:41:48,300
Oh, right.

6390
06:41:50,300 --> 06:41:52,300
Am I taking it?

6391
06:41:52,300 --> 06:41:54,300
And then you guys are world hopping?

6392
06:41:58,300 --> 06:42:00,300
And then you're coming back to this world?

6393
06:42:02,300 --> 06:42:04,300
Yeah, this track is...

6394
06:42:06,300 --> 06:42:08,300
Gen 2 based after

6395
06:42:08,300 --> 06:42:10,300
old school runescape tracks

6396
06:42:10,300 --> 06:42:12,300
question mark.

6397
06:42:16,300 --> 06:42:18,300
Oh wait, I should be facing you today.

6398
06:42:18,300 --> 06:42:20,300
Honestly,

6399
06:42:20,300 --> 06:42:22,300
I wouldn't mind that.

6400
06:42:22,300 --> 06:42:24,300
I'm kind of down for that.

6401
06:42:24,300 --> 06:42:26,300
I was actually thinking of

6402
06:42:26,300 --> 06:42:28,300
Legend of Zelda Minish Cap

6403
06:42:28,300 --> 06:42:30,300
but brought

6404
06:42:30,300 --> 06:42:32,300
to kind of modern standards

6405
06:42:32,300 --> 06:42:34,300
for Gen 2.

6406
06:42:34,300 --> 06:42:36,300
Runescape OSD?

6407
06:42:38,300 --> 06:42:40,300
If we had like a mischievous little brat thing,

6408
06:42:40,300 --> 06:42:42,300
this song

6409
06:42:42,300 --> 06:42:44,300
was kind of like

6410
06:42:44,300 --> 06:42:46,300
not Circus S.

6411
06:42:46,300 --> 06:42:48,300
I guess it was Circus S.

6412
06:42:48,300 --> 06:42:50,300
Does everyone have an oil can?

6413
06:42:50,300 --> 06:42:52,300
Or...

6414
06:42:52,300 --> 06:42:54,300
Oh, there's a respawn.

6415
06:42:54,300 --> 06:42:56,300
That took a whole second.

6416
06:42:56,300 --> 06:42:58,300
Everyone got an oil can?

6417
06:42:58,300 --> 06:43:00,300
Maybe I know you're taking that now.

6418
06:43:00,300 --> 06:43:02,300
Okay, if you have an oil can,

6419
06:43:02,300 --> 06:43:04,300
go back out to the center over here.

6420
06:43:04,300 --> 06:43:06,300
If you don't have an oil can,

6421
06:43:06,300 --> 06:43:08,300
wait for it to spawn in that room

6422
06:43:08,300 --> 06:43:10,300
or you can do what's called world hopping

6423
06:43:10,300 --> 06:43:12,300
where you purposely swap to a new world

6424
06:43:12,300 --> 06:43:14,300
and it should

6425
06:43:14,300 --> 06:43:16,300
be like a new instance.

6426
06:43:16,300 --> 06:43:18,300
But if you have an oil can, you're allowed to come out here.

6427
06:43:20,300 --> 06:43:22,300
Minish is 20 years old now.

6428
06:43:22,300 --> 06:43:24,300
Stubious brat.

6429
06:43:26,300 --> 06:43:28,300
I would watch Zelda.

6430
06:43:28,300 --> 06:43:30,300
I will uncontroll.

6431
06:43:30,300 --> 06:43:32,300
I just want to support whoever gets sea shanty.

6432
06:43:32,300 --> 06:43:34,300
No, it has to be like hidden,

6433
06:43:34,300 --> 06:43:36,300
but when you know what it is, you know.

6434
06:43:36,300 --> 06:43:38,300
Oh, there's a reefling there.

6435
06:43:38,300 --> 06:43:40,300
We're not ready yet.

6436
06:43:40,300 --> 06:43:42,300
I'll just check if anyone's back here.

6437
06:43:42,300 --> 06:43:44,300
Other than that reefling.

6438
06:43:44,300 --> 06:43:46,300
Oh, there's one there.

6439
06:43:46,300 --> 06:43:48,300
I was just straight up reefling.

6440
06:43:48,300 --> 06:43:50,300
You actually got the name reefling.

6441
06:43:50,300 --> 06:43:52,300
I'm surprised no one else took it.

6442
06:43:52,300 --> 06:43:54,300
I guess we'll just beat out...

6443
06:43:54,300 --> 06:43:56,300
We're gonna beat up rats out here.

6444
06:43:56,300 --> 06:43:58,300
Okay, we're just gonna get our combat level a bit higher.

6445
06:43:58,300 --> 06:44:00,300
Oh, I just leveled up.

6446
06:44:00,300 --> 06:44:02,300
What did I get? I got a taxix.

6447
06:44:02,300 --> 06:44:04,300
Oh, there's spiders as well.

6448
06:44:04,300 --> 06:44:06,300
Yeah, let's just level up her combat a little bit.

6449
06:44:06,300 --> 06:44:08,300
Why not?

6450
06:44:08,300 --> 06:44:10,300
Woo.

6451
06:44:10,300 --> 06:44:12,300
Us following her gives me

6452
06:44:12,300 --> 06:44:14,300
Ugandan knuckles flashbacks.

6453
06:44:14,300 --> 06:44:16,300
This beat only fake queen.

6454
06:44:18,300 --> 06:44:20,300
Would you hum shanty?

6455
06:44:20,300 --> 06:44:22,300
Hmm.

6456
06:44:22,300 --> 06:44:24,300
Hmm.

6457
06:44:24,300 --> 06:44:26,300
Hmm.

6458
06:44:26,300 --> 06:44:28,300
Hmm.

6459
06:44:28,300 --> 06:44:30,300
Hmm.

6460
06:44:30,300 --> 06:44:32,300
Hmm.

6461
06:44:32,300 --> 06:44:34,300
Hmm.

6462
06:44:34,300 --> 06:44:36,300
Hmm.

6463
06:44:36,300 --> 06:44:38,300
Hmm.

6464
06:44:38,300 --> 06:44:40,300
Hmm.

6465
06:44:40,300 --> 06:44:42,300
Yeah, I managed to get the reefling name

6466
06:44:42,300 --> 06:44:44,300
still five hours a day.

6467
06:44:44,300 --> 06:44:46,300
Yeah.

6468
06:44:46,300 --> 06:44:48,300
That's sea shanty.

6469
06:44:48,300 --> 06:44:50,300
We're just leveling up her combat.

6470
06:44:50,300 --> 06:44:52,300
Hmm.

6471
06:44:52,300 --> 06:44:54,300
There's still a reefling over there getting absolutely...

6472
06:44:54,300 --> 06:44:56,300
What are you getting annihilated by?

6473
06:44:56,300 --> 06:44:58,300
A rat? Oh, okay, that's fine.

6474
06:44:58,300 --> 06:45:00,300
And there's one there.

6475
06:45:00,300 --> 06:45:02,300
There's a third?

6476
06:45:02,300 --> 06:45:04,300
Yeah, we've got Hatsumiku chilling over there.

6477
06:45:04,300 --> 06:45:06,300
Hmm.

6478
06:45:06,300 --> 06:45:08,300
Hmm.

6479
06:45:08,300 --> 06:45:10,300
Reefling.

6480
06:45:10,300 --> 06:45:12,300
Now we have a max roll.

6481
06:45:12,300 --> 06:45:14,300
Hmm.

6482
06:45:14,300 --> 06:45:16,300
Let's get some level up.

6483
06:45:16,300 --> 06:45:18,300
No way that rat just dunked my shield.

6484
06:45:18,300 --> 06:45:20,300
I went bonk.

6485
06:45:20,300 --> 06:45:22,300
Yeah, Amy would have chosen...

6486
06:45:22,300 --> 06:45:24,300
Maybe.

6487
06:45:24,300 --> 06:45:26,300
She would show us maybe.

6488
06:45:26,300 --> 06:45:28,300
I remember that meme went like absolutely viral.

6489
06:45:28,300 --> 06:45:30,300
Someone said that was the start

6490
06:45:30,300 --> 06:45:32,300
of the brain rot meta

6491
06:45:32,300 --> 06:45:34,300
when it comes to memes.

6492
06:45:36,300 --> 06:45:38,300
Which I found rather unsafe.

6493
06:45:38,300 --> 06:45:40,300
Wow.

6494
06:45:42,300 --> 06:45:44,300
I think there's someone else

6495
06:45:44,300 --> 06:45:46,300
that's fighting that.

6496
06:45:46,300 --> 06:45:48,300
Here we go.

6497
06:45:48,300 --> 06:45:50,300
We've almost got all over

6498
06:45:50,300 --> 06:45:52,300
cans.

6499
06:45:52,300 --> 06:45:54,300
And then we'll level up on fishy.

6500
06:45:54,300 --> 06:45:56,300
I keep saying fishin'.

6501
06:45:56,300 --> 06:45:58,300
It's not fishin', we're doing kootin'.

6502
06:45:58,300 --> 06:46:00,300
My PCs fan just started

6503
06:46:00,300 --> 06:46:02,300
up. I get nervous when my PCs...

6504
06:46:02,300 --> 06:46:04,300
I'm like, what's wrong?

6505
06:46:04,300 --> 06:46:06,300
What's wrong?

6506
06:46:06,300 --> 06:46:08,300
Oh?

6507
06:46:08,300 --> 06:46:10,300
Last reefling that needs to can?

6508
06:46:10,300 --> 06:46:12,300
The question mark?

6509
06:46:12,300 --> 06:46:14,300
I don't see anyone else doing the levers.

6510
06:46:14,300 --> 06:46:16,300
Am I going crazy or are we clear?

6511
06:46:16,300 --> 06:46:18,300
Have we did it?

6512
06:46:18,300 --> 06:46:20,300
Are we ready to move on?

6513
06:46:20,300 --> 06:46:22,300
Oh, he's done it.

6514
06:46:22,300 --> 06:46:24,300
I don't want to say dancing.

6515
06:46:24,300 --> 06:46:26,300
Okay, if everyone's got a can,

6516
06:46:26,300 --> 06:46:28,300
up the ladders, please.

6517
06:46:28,300 --> 06:46:30,300
Little reeflings, if everyone's got a can.

6518
06:46:30,300 --> 06:46:32,300
Oh wait, no!

6519
06:46:32,300 --> 06:46:34,300
Sorry, there's one more.

6520
06:46:34,300 --> 06:46:36,300
I

6521
06:46:36,300 --> 06:46:38,300
think they're still doing the lever

6522
06:46:38,300 --> 06:46:40,300
stage.

6523
06:46:40,300 --> 06:46:42,300
I'm sorry, reefling such a badger.

6524
06:46:42,300 --> 06:46:44,300
You can come back down and we'll keep

6525
06:46:44,300 --> 06:46:46,300
killing the means.

6526
06:46:46,300 --> 06:46:48,300
He's

6527
06:46:48,300 --> 06:46:50,300
going to be absolutely beaten up by

6528
06:46:50,300 --> 06:46:52,300
that rat, so he'll help you out.

6529
06:46:52,300 --> 06:46:54,300
There you go.

6530
06:46:54,300 --> 06:46:56,300
Uh...

6531
06:47:00,300 --> 06:47:02,300
Did you get it?

6532
06:47:02,300 --> 06:47:04,300
I don't know.

6533
06:47:06,300 --> 06:47:08,300
Did you get it?

6534
06:47:08,300 --> 06:47:10,300
You're moving around erratically

6535
06:47:10,300 --> 06:47:12,300
as a reefling...

6536
06:47:14,300 --> 06:47:16,300
I don't know, are you stuck

6537
06:47:16,300 --> 06:47:18,300
on the levers?

6538
06:47:18,300 --> 06:47:20,300
You're not taping.

6539
06:47:20,300 --> 06:47:22,300
Go on, I'll catch up.

6540
06:47:22,300 --> 06:47:24,300
Are you sure, reeflings?

6541
06:47:24,300 --> 06:47:26,300
I won't feel anyone feel left out.

6542
06:47:28,300 --> 06:47:30,300
VR chat was well,

6543
06:47:30,300 --> 06:47:32,300
and that's just

6544
06:47:32,300 --> 06:47:34,300
a bit weird.

6545
06:47:34,300 --> 06:47:36,300
I was going to have to play VR chat

6546
06:47:36,300 --> 06:47:38,300
to learn how the

6547
06:47:38,300 --> 06:47:40,300
3D models work. I have no idea how that

6548
06:47:40,300 --> 06:47:42,300
3D model streaming works.

6549
06:47:42,300 --> 06:47:44,300
But I don't know if you can use

6550
06:47:44,300 --> 06:47:46,300
other programs as well.

6551
06:47:46,300 --> 06:47:48,300
Oh, I'm leveling combat,

6552
06:47:48,300 --> 06:47:50,300
not to brag.

6553
06:47:56,300 --> 06:47:58,300
You will learn.

6554
06:47:58,300 --> 06:48:00,300
Can you say error again?

6555
06:48:00,300 --> 06:48:02,300
Error?

6556
06:48:02,300 --> 06:48:04,300
Error.

6557
06:48:04,300 --> 06:48:06,300
Error, switching tracks.

6558
06:48:06,300 --> 06:48:08,300
You don't need to use VR chat

6559
06:48:08,300 --> 06:48:10,300
for 3D models.

6560
06:48:10,300 --> 06:48:12,300
I honestly don't know

6561
06:48:12,300 --> 06:48:14,300
anything about it. The girls want 3D models,

6562
06:48:14,300 --> 06:48:16,300
and I'll pay for it.

6563
06:48:16,300 --> 06:48:18,300
That's pretty much all I know about 3D models.

6564
06:48:18,300 --> 06:48:20,300
I'm like, joking.

6565
06:48:20,300 --> 06:48:22,300
If they want 3D models, they'll get it.

6566
06:48:26,300 --> 06:48:28,300
VR chat isn't interesting at all.

6567
06:48:28,300 --> 06:48:30,300
Oh!

6568
06:48:30,300 --> 06:48:32,300
I've saw VR

6569
06:48:32,300 --> 06:48:34,300
ASMR videos. I thought that was pretty cool.

6570
06:48:36,300 --> 06:48:38,300
And plus, it would be cool to see

6571
06:48:38,300 --> 06:48:40,300
the height difference of the girls as well.

6572
06:48:40,300 --> 06:48:42,300
Go on, y'all.

6573
06:48:42,300 --> 06:48:44,300
Okay, okay.

6574
06:48:44,300 --> 06:48:46,300
We're being sent away by the

6575
06:48:46,300 --> 06:48:48,300
reflying, right? Upstairs, everyone.

6576
06:48:48,300 --> 06:48:50,300
We're being sent away.

6577
06:48:50,300 --> 06:48:52,300
Upstairs.

6578
06:48:52,300 --> 06:48:54,300
Okay, there's a lever here.

6579
06:48:54,300 --> 06:48:56,300
Pull the lever, crunk!

6580
06:48:58,300 --> 06:49:00,300
Oh! Okay, okay, okay.

6581
06:49:00,300 --> 06:49:02,300
Right, we need to go up the stairs again.

6582
06:49:02,300 --> 06:49:04,300
Right, let's go back here.

6583
06:49:04,300 --> 06:49:06,300
I'mma sip my tea.

6584
06:49:06,300 --> 06:49:08,300
Okay.

6585
06:49:10,300 --> 06:49:12,300
You literally talk like a real mummy

6586
06:49:12,300 --> 06:49:14,300
with the girls. They want 3D models.

6587
06:49:14,300 --> 06:49:16,300
Yeah, I'll just pay for it, darlin'. There you go, darlin'.

6588
06:49:16,300 --> 06:49:18,300
All yours. I don't know what it's about,

6589
06:49:18,300 --> 06:49:20,300
but you just enjoy yourself.

6590
06:49:20,300 --> 06:49:22,300
It's true. They'll be like, I want this.

6591
06:49:22,300 --> 06:49:24,300
I'm like, oh, you just, oh, you get it.

6592
06:49:24,300 --> 06:49:26,300
You just enjoy yourself, hen.

6593
06:49:28,300 --> 06:49:30,300
Right, okay. Talk to the professor at the top of the stairs.

6594
06:49:30,300 --> 06:49:32,300
Oh, you found anything yet?

6595
06:49:32,300 --> 06:49:34,300
I have everything. Give them to me here, then.

6596
06:49:34,300 --> 06:49:36,300
All his.

6597
06:49:36,300 --> 06:49:38,300
Oh, you put them.

6598
06:49:38,300 --> 06:49:40,300
Noises are being made?

6599
06:49:40,300 --> 06:49:42,300
He's a man!

6600
06:49:42,300 --> 06:49:44,300
Thank you, madame. I was dreadfully irritating being a chicken.

6601
06:49:44,300 --> 06:49:46,300
How can I ever thank you?

6602
06:49:46,300 --> 06:49:48,300
Well, a cash reward is always nice.

6603
06:49:48,300 --> 06:49:50,300
Of course, of course!

6604
06:49:50,300 --> 06:49:52,300
You're awarded 4 quest points of 300 coins.

6605
06:49:52,300 --> 06:49:54,300
Yay!

6606
06:49:54,300 --> 06:49:56,300
That was really quick. Other than, like,

6607
06:49:56,300 --> 06:49:58,300
the horrific issues.

6608
06:49:58,300 --> 06:50:00,300
That was like a really quick quest.

6609
06:50:00,300 --> 06:50:02,300
Um...

6610
06:50:02,300 --> 06:50:04,300
Right, we're not doing any more questing.

6611
06:50:04,300 --> 06:50:06,300
We're leveling up.

6612
06:50:06,300 --> 06:50:08,300
Next.

6613
06:50:08,300 --> 06:50:10,300
Money, let's go!

6614
06:50:10,300 --> 06:50:12,300
What is this pressure gauge?

6615
06:50:12,300 --> 06:50:14,300
Don't touch it. It's going to explode.

6616
06:50:14,300 --> 06:50:16,300
What do we do?

6617
06:50:16,300 --> 06:50:18,300
What pressure gauge?

6618
06:50:18,300 --> 06:50:20,300
It's really like any other scientific

6619
06:50:20,300 --> 06:50:22,300
thing.

6620
06:50:22,300 --> 06:50:24,300
I guess that's it, and we just leave.

6621
06:50:24,300 --> 06:50:26,300
But that...

6622
06:50:26,300 --> 06:50:28,300
It's in the fountain.

6623
06:50:28,300 --> 06:50:30,300
It's in the fountain. That's why you need to poison it.

6624
06:50:30,300 --> 06:50:32,300
How bizarre.

6625
06:50:32,300 --> 06:50:34,300
Oh, there's the fish food.

6626
06:50:34,300 --> 06:50:36,300
Ugh!

6627
06:50:36,300 --> 06:50:38,300
I guess that's it. We're already

6628
06:50:38,300 --> 06:50:40,300
freaking done this quest. Hold on.

6629
06:50:40,300 --> 06:50:42,300
Wah.

6630
06:50:42,300 --> 06:50:44,300
Oh wait, why did you not let me out that door?

6631
06:50:46,300 --> 06:50:48,300
Open large door.

6632
06:50:48,300 --> 06:50:50,300
Wait, why does it make me turn backwards?

6633
06:50:52,300 --> 06:50:54,300
I keep... It doesn't let me out this door?

6634
06:50:54,300 --> 06:50:56,300
Open large door.

6635
06:50:56,300 --> 06:50:58,300
It won't open.

6636
06:50:58,300 --> 06:51:00,300
Front door is one way.

6637
06:51:00,300 --> 06:51:02,300
Oh, so we have to

6638
06:51:02,300 --> 06:51:04,300
go all the way around again?

6639
06:51:04,300 --> 06:51:06,300
Oh, okay.

6640
06:51:06,300 --> 06:51:08,300
Another interesting take

6641
06:51:08,300 --> 06:51:10,300
from the dev team?

6642
06:51:10,300 --> 06:51:12,300
Alright, let me sip into my tea.

6643
06:51:14,300 --> 06:51:16,300
Okay, yeah.

6644
06:51:16,300 --> 06:51:18,300
I'll go another one by one door.

6645
06:51:18,300 --> 06:51:20,300
It's over.

6646
06:51:20,300 --> 06:51:22,300
The chair's chasing me.

6647
06:51:22,300 --> 06:51:24,300
Can you even go that way?

6648
06:51:24,300 --> 06:51:26,300
Can you even go that way?

6649
06:51:26,300 --> 06:51:28,300
Oh, you can. You can come around this side?

6650
06:51:30,300 --> 06:51:32,300
Can you teach me?

6651
06:51:32,300 --> 06:51:34,300
Why to play Rensuke Tempah?

6652
06:51:36,300 --> 06:51:38,300
Get ready. Go right back.

6653
06:51:40,300 --> 06:51:42,300
Ow! The tree!

6654
06:51:44,300 --> 06:51:46,300
I don't want to go in a fight. Move!

6655
06:51:46,300 --> 06:51:48,300
What's going on? Why can't I move?

6656
06:51:48,300 --> 06:51:50,300
Hello?

6657
06:51:50,300 --> 06:51:52,300
Am I missing?

6658
06:51:52,300 --> 06:51:54,300
Why can't I not...

6659
06:51:54,300 --> 06:51:56,300
Why? That tree literally

6660
06:51:56,300 --> 06:51:58,300
had me in a death grip. Oh my gosh.

6661
06:52:00,300 --> 06:52:02,300
Mostly was a...

6662
06:52:02,300 --> 06:52:04,300
a guy of fun.

6663
06:52:04,300 --> 06:52:06,300
Don't get skill checked by a tree.

6664
06:52:06,300 --> 06:52:08,300
Literally, one error.

6665
06:52:08,300 --> 06:52:10,300
I almost died there.

6666
06:52:10,300 --> 06:52:12,300
I think the tree liked you, honestly.

6667
06:52:14,300 --> 06:52:16,300
Okay, we made it.

6668
06:52:16,300 --> 06:52:18,300
But I don't think that's all the reeflings.

6669
06:52:18,300 --> 06:52:20,300
This is dangerous, literally. Oh, there's a reefling there.

6670
06:52:22,300 --> 06:52:24,300
Right, we'll wait until a cool army.

6671
06:52:24,300 --> 06:52:26,300
I have an army of reeflings requesting,

6672
06:52:26,300 --> 06:52:28,300
but we're about to go level up our cooking next.

6673
06:52:28,300 --> 06:52:30,300
I'm trying to finish my honey tea

6674
06:52:30,300 --> 06:52:32,300
before it gets cold.

6675
06:52:34,300 --> 06:52:36,300
Wah! Okay.

6676
06:52:36,300 --> 06:52:38,300
Um, next thing

6677
06:52:38,300 --> 06:52:40,300
we're going to do is we're going to

6678
06:52:40,300 --> 06:52:42,300
travel north. We're going to take

6679
06:52:42,300 --> 06:52:44,300
a west and then north

6680
06:52:44,300 --> 06:52:46,300
and we're going to be outside

6681
06:52:46,300 --> 06:52:48,300
the village.

6682
06:52:48,300 --> 06:52:50,300
But we need to go get fish and rods and stuff.

6683
06:52:50,300 --> 06:52:52,300
I don't think there's a fish shop nearby.

6684
06:52:52,300 --> 06:52:54,300
So I think we're going to go to the Grand Exchange

6685
06:52:54,300 --> 06:52:56,300
and buy fish and rods.

6686
06:52:56,300 --> 06:52:58,300
Army, definitely not cold.

6687
06:52:58,300 --> 06:53:00,300
Yeah.

6688
06:53:00,300 --> 06:53:02,300
This music has given me

6689
06:53:02,300 --> 06:53:04,300
a fatal dose of nostalgia.

6690
06:53:04,300 --> 06:53:06,300
Passed so much

6691
06:53:06,300 --> 06:53:08,300
since the last Get Rektor is.

6692
06:53:08,300 --> 06:53:10,300
Hmm.

6693
06:53:10,300 --> 06:53:12,300
As I get stuck

6694
06:53:12,300 --> 06:53:14,300
I'm ruffling fans and bye.

6695
06:53:14,300 --> 06:53:16,300
I've never gotten a runescape.

6696
06:53:16,300 --> 06:53:18,300
It's like either you got into it or you didn't.

6697
06:53:18,300 --> 06:53:20,300
Right, I think that's everyone.

6698
06:53:20,300 --> 06:53:22,300
Hopefully, question mark.

6699
06:53:22,300 --> 06:53:24,300
As we head banger way of victory.

6700
06:53:24,300 --> 06:53:26,300
I don't know about the other

6701
06:53:26,300 --> 06:53:28,300
reefling that got stuck and sent us forward

6702
06:53:28,300 --> 06:53:30,300
but thank you for not holding us back.

6703
06:53:30,300 --> 06:53:32,300
By the same time I feel bad

6704
06:53:32,300 --> 06:53:34,300
because it's like the whole point of this is to

6705
06:53:34,300 --> 06:53:36,300
the question and stuff together.

6706
06:53:36,300 --> 06:53:38,300
Right, let's get in the nicer parts of the channel.

6707
06:53:38,300 --> 06:53:40,300
Let the evil at bay

6708
06:53:40,300 --> 06:53:42,300
type of thing go away.

6709
06:53:42,300 --> 06:53:44,300
Wait, let me finish my tea.

6710
06:53:46,300 --> 06:53:48,300
Either you got into it

6711
06:53:48,300 --> 06:53:50,300
and you're still playing this day or you didn't.

6712
06:53:50,300 --> 06:53:52,300
I got into Guild Wars instead.

6713
06:53:52,300 --> 06:53:54,300
I never played Guild Wars.

6714
06:53:54,300 --> 06:53:56,300
Hmm.

6715
06:53:56,300 --> 06:53:58,300
Hmm.

6716
06:53:58,300 --> 06:54:00,300
Hmm.

6717
06:54:00,300 --> 06:54:02,300
Trying to finish this.

6718
06:54:02,300 --> 06:54:04,300
Ah.

6719
06:54:04,300 --> 06:54:06,300
Oh, I thought it gave us feathers but it didn't.

6720
06:54:06,300 --> 06:54:08,300
I was just an image of a feather because we need

6721
06:54:08,300 --> 06:54:10,300
feathers to do fishing.

6722
06:54:10,300 --> 06:54:12,300
Hmm.

6723
06:54:12,300 --> 06:54:14,300
Hmm.

6724
06:54:14,300 --> 06:54:16,300
I was so into it and was so shy that

6725
06:54:16,300 --> 06:54:18,300
in taping class I'd want big letters, RuneScape rules

6726
06:54:18,300 --> 06:54:20,300
and wait for someone to see it and ask me if I played.

6727
06:54:20,300 --> 06:54:22,300
Aww, that's such a shame.

6728
06:54:26,300 --> 06:54:28,300
Feathers, we need feathers.

6729
06:54:28,300 --> 06:54:30,300
Birds of a feather.

6730
06:54:30,300 --> 06:54:32,300
Right, we're gonna take

6731
06:54:32,300 --> 06:54:34,300
a left

6732
06:54:34,300 --> 06:54:36,300
and go...

6733
06:54:36,300 --> 06:54:38,300
Oh wait, no. Do we need to go to Port Sarim?

6734
06:54:40,300 --> 06:54:42,300
I think we actually need to go to the fishing

6735
06:54:42,300 --> 06:54:44,300
shop to buy our rod and feathers.

6736
06:54:44,300 --> 06:54:46,300
The fishing shops

6737
06:54:46,300 --> 06:54:48,300
are west

6738
06:54:48,300 --> 06:54:50,300
and south so we'll go west and south.

6739
06:54:50,300 --> 06:54:52,300
Just follow me

6740
06:54:52,300 --> 06:54:54,300
with my golden stuff.

6741
06:54:54,300 --> 06:54:56,300
Oh no, I'm gonna follow the rabbit.

6742
06:54:58,300 --> 06:55:00,300
We follow the rabbit. You coming?

6743
06:55:00,300 --> 06:55:02,300
Refling?

6744
06:55:02,300 --> 06:55:04,300
Yes.

6745
06:55:04,300 --> 06:55:06,300
Uh...

6746
06:55:08,300 --> 06:55:10,300
Take us westward and then south

6747
06:55:10,300 --> 06:55:12,300
on the main road.

6748
06:55:12,300 --> 06:55:14,300
Feathers. Oh no, am I saying feathers?

6749
06:55:14,300 --> 06:55:16,300
Oh, we need some feathers.

6750
06:55:16,300 --> 06:55:18,300
Wait, how did you say feathers?

6751
06:55:18,300 --> 06:55:20,300
Feathers.

6752
06:55:20,300 --> 06:55:22,300
Feathers. Feathers.

6753
06:55:22,300 --> 06:55:24,300
Oh, it sounds like I'm kind of

6754
06:55:24,300 --> 06:55:26,300
saying father.

6755
06:55:26,300 --> 06:55:28,300
I guess. Feathers.

6756
06:55:28,300 --> 06:55:30,300
Your father.

6757
06:55:30,300 --> 06:55:32,300
In this line you also say

6758
06:55:32,300 --> 06:55:34,300
your father, isn't it?

6759
06:55:34,300 --> 06:55:36,300
And it's like, ah, that's my dad.

6760
06:55:36,300 --> 06:55:38,300
I don't want change.

6761
06:55:40,300 --> 06:55:42,300
I never played Guild Wars Organscape.

6762
06:55:42,300 --> 06:55:44,300
I want silly Scottish women!

6763
06:55:46,300 --> 06:55:48,300
Feathers.

6764
06:55:48,300 --> 06:55:50,300
Your wee feathers.

6765
06:55:50,300 --> 06:55:52,300
You'd weave it behind, Refling.

6766
06:55:52,300 --> 06:55:54,300
You'd put your wee running boots on.

6767
06:55:54,300 --> 06:55:56,300
You'd put your...

6768
06:56:02,300 --> 06:56:04,300
Feathers.

6769
06:56:04,300 --> 06:56:06,300
Feathers.

6770
06:56:06,300 --> 06:56:08,300
Feathers.

6771
06:56:08,300 --> 06:56:10,300
Feathers.

6772
06:56:10,300 --> 06:56:12,300
Feathers.

6773
06:56:12,300 --> 06:56:14,300
Feathers.

6774
06:56:14,300 --> 06:56:16,300
Feathers.

6775
06:56:16,300 --> 06:56:18,300
Feathers.

6776
06:56:18,300 --> 06:56:20,300
Feathers.

6777
06:56:20,300 --> 06:56:22,300
Feathers.

6778
06:56:22,300 --> 06:56:24,300
Feathers.

6779
06:56:24,300 --> 06:56:26,300
Feathers.

6780
06:56:26,300 --> 06:56:28,300
Oh, we're gonna do a brawl.

6781
06:56:28,300 --> 06:56:30,300
Uh... at the end of the stream

6782
06:56:30,300 --> 06:56:37,300
We're going to hop over the wall and fist fight each other and I'm going to get a rose and I'll give it to whoever wins the 50 cups.

6783
06:56:39,300 --> 06:56:41,300
Oh, pardon me, I'm broken.

6784
06:56:43,300 --> 06:56:48,300
Ok, in this shop you will need to buy a rod. Most of you already have one.

6785
06:56:49,300 --> 06:56:51,300
Ah, you guys so fast.

6786
06:56:51,300 --> 06:56:57,300
So trade with Garrett and then buy... oh no, there's only one.

6787
06:56:58,300 --> 06:57:01,300
That costs five coin, so buy one.

6788
06:57:02,300 --> 06:57:05,300
Do we need feathers or do we need the fishing bait?

6789
06:57:06,300 --> 06:57:08,300
Is it a fishing bait we need?

6790
06:57:10,300 --> 06:57:12,300
I made this tea so honey.

6791
06:57:15,300 --> 06:57:18,300
Oh that's sweet, that's too sweet. I can actually finish that.

6792
06:57:19,300 --> 06:57:25,300
All the sweetness is at the bottom. Feathers for trout and salmon.

6793
06:57:28,300 --> 06:57:30,300
Is that ticking up? Oh it is.

6794
06:57:35,300 --> 06:57:37,300
I don't have the money.

6795
06:57:38,300 --> 06:57:39,300
Or maybe I do.

6796
06:57:41,300 --> 06:57:44,300
Ok, that's all I can buy with what I've got.

6797
06:57:44,300 --> 06:57:58,300
I haven't got enough for anything else. I've got 73 feathers, I didn't think this far ahead.

6798
06:58:01,300 --> 06:58:04,300
I opened a stream and didn't see you here.

6799
06:58:08,300 --> 06:58:10,300
I wish this to trade with you, except trade.

6800
06:58:14,300 --> 06:58:15,300
Eh, I still have a key.

6801
06:58:16,300 --> 06:58:20,300
Oh, that's going to be a lot of feathers to spread about, not going to lie.

6802
06:58:21,300 --> 06:58:23,300
How do you have so much money?

6803
06:58:24,300 --> 06:58:27,300
Right, let me buy feathers for... what are these? Feather pack?

6804
06:58:28,300 --> 06:58:29,300
What's that?

6805
06:58:30,300 --> 06:58:32,300
I don't know. If I buy fifth... oh you can.

6806
06:58:35,300 --> 06:58:38,300
Oh, that's so smart! Inside the feather pack.

6807
06:58:39,300 --> 06:58:41,300
I'm going to keep some heels on me.

6808
06:58:42,300 --> 06:58:45,300
Right, I can give feather packs to reeflings.

6809
06:58:48,300 --> 06:58:50,300
Why does that not buy when I click it?

6810
06:58:52,300 --> 06:58:55,300
Wait, I'm dropping them! Oh, hold on, I'm being dumb.

6811
06:58:57,300 --> 06:58:59,300
I can trade the feather packs.

6812
06:59:00,300 --> 06:59:03,300
Ok, I've got like a thousand feathers now. Who needs feathers?

6813
06:59:05,300 --> 06:59:07,300
I think everyone needs feathers, honestly.

6814
06:59:07,300 --> 06:59:10,300
If you need feathers, trade me and I'll give you... wait, actually.

6815
06:59:11,300 --> 06:59:13,300
I should like give 200 feathers each?

6816
06:59:17,300 --> 06:59:20,300
I'll just say buy 50 and then I'll give 200 feathers.

6817
06:59:28,300 --> 06:59:31,300
I love spreading feathers on my...

6818
06:59:32,300 --> 06:59:34,300
Should we get a harpy? We should totally get a harpy.

6819
06:59:34,300 --> 06:59:36,300
I'm glad to take a feather pack.

6820
06:59:36,300 --> 06:59:39,300
Ok, trade me if you need feathers. I'll try and give you like 200.

6821
06:59:40,300 --> 06:59:43,300
Whose outfit is that? Is that even a reefling? Are you a reefling?

6822
06:59:43,300 --> 06:59:46,300
I don't know. I think that might just be someone caught in the crossfire.

6823
06:59:47,300 --> 06:59:51,300
Right, let's see. Accept and then offer...

6824
06:59:52,300 --> 06:59:54,300
200 and then we'll go fishing.

6825
06:59:55,300 --> 06:59:56,300
Accept.

6826
06:59:58,300 --> 07:00:00,300
Wait, what? Hold on.

6827
07:00:00,300 --> 07:00:02,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, why did that not work?

6828
07:00:02,300 --> 07:00:04,300
200 and I...

6829
07:00:04,300 --> 07:00:06,300
Yeah. Oh, jeez. Sorry.

6830
07:00:07,300 --> 07:00:09,300
I don't know where that went. It just disappeared into space.

6831
07:00:11,300 --> 07:00:14,300
Ok, there's 200 for you and then there's two...

6832
07:00:15,300 --> 07:00:16,300
How dare you?

6833
07:00:19,300 --> 07:00:20,300
Just trying to see.

6834
07:00:23,300 --> 07:00:24,300
And then 200 for you.

6835
07:00:25,300 --> 07:00:27,300
And then sugar mummy.

6836
07:00:28,300 --> 07:00:31,300
You say that as if a reefling didn't just hand me all of his paycheck and runescape.

6837
07:00:33,300 --> 07:00:36,300
Where's Johnny at now? We're at Port Sarim.

6838
07:00:37,300 --> 07:00:38,300
We're on World 380.

6839
07:00:39,300 --> 07:00:42,300
We're currently at Port Sarim buying...

6840
07:00:43,300 --> 07:00:45,300
Ok, my PC just sped up trying to zoom that in.

6841
07:00:46,300 --> 07:00:51,300
And then we're going to go up to Barbarian Village to get salmon because there's a permanent fire there.

6842
07:00:57,300 --> 07:00:59,300
And we'll do 200.

6843
07:01:00,300 --> 07:01:03,300
No, I've done it again. Sorry. I keep teasing you with a feather.

6844
07:01:04,300 --> 07:01:05,300
I've done it again!

6845
07:01:07,300 --> 07:01:08,300
I can't stop teasing you right now.

6846
07:01:09,300 --> 07:01:11,300
I'm tickling you with the feathers.

6847
07:01:11,300 --> 07:01:14,300
I'm like, oh, do you want the feather and like tickle you and then run away with it?

6848
07:01:15,300 --> 07:01:18,300
Like pushing it against your face like ASMR and then like...

6849
07:01:20,300 --> 07:01:22,300
You need feathers too.

6850
07:01:22,300 --> 07:01:26,300
I'll buy a ton as well so when we head over there, we should be fine.

6851
07:01:26,300 --> 07:01:30,300
So if you need more, I can always get like always just trade more.

6852
07:01:31,300 --> 07:01:33,300
Teasing us with a feather, honestly.

6853
07:01:39,300 --> 07:01:42,300
Thank you, pretty lady. Played with me.

6854
07:01:45,300 --> 07:01:48,300
Has everyone got what they... Where the heck is the guy?

6855
07:01:48,300 --> 07:01:50,300
Where's the NPC to buy, awful?

6856
07:01:50,300 --> 07:01:52,300
I can't see. There's too many of us.

6857
07:01:53,300 --> 07:01:55,300
It's Miss. He's not for me.

6858
07:01:56,300 --> 07:01:58,300
Alright, where's the guy to buy freaking things off?

6859
07:01:58,300 --> 07:01:59,300
Oh, there he is.

6860
07:02:01,300 --> 07:02:04,300
Gonna buy like a bunch of feather packs and open them up.

6861
07:02:07,300 --> 07:02:09,300
Oh my god, have I already spent 10k on feathers?

6862
07:02:09,300 --> 07:02:12,300
Jeez, this game is not cheap. The economy's in shambles.

6863
07:02:17,300 --> 07:02:20,300
Right, that's like literally almost 5k. That's more than enough.

6864
07:02:20,300 --> 07:02:23,300
Does anyone else... You need some too.

6865
07:02:27,300 --> 07:02:29,300
Does that work? It did work, thank goodness.

6866
07:02:29,300 --> 07:02:33,300
How did you know that our weaknesses are feathers? Stop using your powers on us.

6867
07:02:33,300 --> 07:02:36,300
I don't think I ever thought of feathers. Did I do a tickling?

6868
07:02:36,300 --> 07:02:41,300
I may have got... I don't think I got... No, I think I got you tickling me artwork.

6869
07:02:42,300 --> 07:02:43,300
You're welcome.

6870
07:02:43,300 --> 07:02:47,300
Does anyone else need any feathers?

6871
07:02:47,300 --> 07:02:49,300
Or are we all ready to go?

6872
07:02:50,300 --> 07:02:53,300
We need to thank Sugar Daddy, Weflin...

6873
07:02:55,300 --> 07:02:58,300
The one that gave me poison that I thought was being bred.

6874
07:02:58,300 --> 07:03:01,300
I realised and I was like, I didn't accept the quest and had to loop with the chick.

6875
07:03:01,300 --> 07:03:04,300
Oh no, sorry, did you manage?

6876
07:03:04,300 --> 07:03:06,300
I could take some please.

6877
07:03:11,300 --> 07:03:12,300
Trade.

6878
07:03:12,300 --> 07:03:15,300
And then offer X amount.

6879
07:03:15,300 --> 07:03:18,300
Alright, has everyone got a rod? Not the one that's already attached to you.

6880
07:03:18,300 --> 07:03:21,300
One bought from the thing.

6881
07:03:21,300 --> 07:03:25,300
Were you giggling? Were you Sugar Daddy, Weflin and...

6882
07:03:25,300 --> 07:03:26,300
Giggling?

6883
07:03:33,300 --> 07:03:35,300
Kill... What's... What's heavier?

6884
07:03:35,300 --> 07:03:36,300
Kilograms.

6885
07:03:36,300 --> 07:03:40,300
Right, is everyone ready to do the walk? The walk.

6886
07:03:42,300 --> 07:03:45,300
Yes, I finished it. Oh no, you need some... Hold up.

6887
07:03:45,300 --> 07:03:46,300
Except trade.

6888
07:03:46,300 --> 07:03:48,300
We're getting there, we're getting there.

6889
07:03:49,300 --> 07:03:51,300
Wait, no, I don't... No, I don't need your rod.

6890
07:03:51,300 --> 07:03:53,300
Stop, I don't need your rod.

6891
07:03:53,300 --> 07:03:55,300
You keep your rod to yourself, Weflin.

6892
07:03:55,300 --> 07:03:57,300
It's not the time for that.

6893
07:04:02,300 --> 07:04:03,300
I do have a rod for vision.

6894
07:04:03,300 --> 07:04:05,300
Now I need some feathers, thanks.

6895
07:04:05,300 --> 07:04:07,300
Sugar would catch up me.

6896
07:04:07,300 --> 07:04:11,300
Right, is everyone ready to follow me and I'll take us to Barbarian?

6897
07:04:11,300 --> 07:04:13,300
You need a fly fishing rod for the fishes.

6898
07:04:14,300 --> 07:04:17,300
Oh, we need a specific type of rod. Of course we do.

6899
07:04:17,300 --> 07:04:20,300
What rod of alcohol? I've got a fishing rod.

6900
07:04:20,300 --> 07:04:22,300
I need a fly rod. Hold on, trade Garrett.

6901
07:04:26,300 --> 07:04:27,300
Fly fishing rod.

6902
07:04:27,300 --> 07:04:32,300
Right, does everyone have a fly fishing rod?

6903
07:04:32,300 --> 07:04:34,300
Before we move on to the next location.

6904
07:04:36,300 --> 07:04:39,300
Lesson two hour warning for Mercy Modest.

6905
07:04:40,300 --> 07:04:41,300
Nope.

6906
07:04:42,300 --> 07:04:43,300
Do you need...

6907
07:04:44,300 --> 07:04:45,300
Me...

6908
07:04:46,300 --> 07:04:47,300
To...

6909
07:04:48,300 --> 07:04:49,300
Oh.

6910
07:04:50,300 --> 07:04:51,300
I hope it restokes.

6911
07:04:51,300 --> 07:04:52,300
You're out.

6912
07:04:53,300 --> 07:04:55,300
I do have a pretty fly rod.

6913
07:04:55,300 --> 07:04:57,300
Pretty fly for a white guy.

6914
07:04:57,300 --> 07:05:00,300
You know it's kinda hard just to get along today.

6915
07:05:01,300 --> 07:05:02,300
He asked for...

6916
07:05:02,300 --> 07:05:04,300
What's that? He asked for ink.

6917
07:05:04,300 --> 07:05:06,300
He asked for a 13 year.

6918
07:05:06,300 --> 07:05:08,300
Instead they drew a fairy one.

6919
07:05:08,300 --> 07:05:09,300
It's a fairy one.

6920
07:05:20,300 --> 07:05:22,300
I don't know... They're not restocking.

6921
07:05:22,300 --> 07:05:24,300
They're like so slow to restock.

6922
07:05:25,300 --> 07:05:26,300
I don't know if I can...

6923
07:05:26,300 --> 07:05:27,300
Wait, we are...

6924
07:05:27,300 --> 07:05:29,300
We're gonna be right next to the grand exchange.

6925
07:05:29,300 --> 07:05:31,300
Maybe I'll buy some off the grand exchange.

6926
07:05:33,300 --> 07:05:34,300
I'll go with the grand exchange.

6927
07:05:34,300 --> 07:05:35,300
Yeah, okay.

6928
07:05:35,300 --> 07:05:37,300
We're gonna make it to the grand exchange.

6929
07:05:37,300 --> 07:05:38,300
Don't worry.

6930
07:05:38,300 --> 07:05:40,300
If you don't have a fly freshen rod,

6931
07:05:40,300 --> 07:05:42,300
we're gonna be very close to the grand exchange.

6932
07:05:42,300 --> 07:05:43,300
So don't worry.

6933
07:05:43,300 --> 07:05:44,300
You can follow me.

6934
07:05:45,300 --> 07:05:46,300
Follow Golden...

6935
07:05:46,300 --> 07:05:47,300
Golden me.

6936
07:05:48,300 --> 07:05:50,300
Is there any more reasons in that shop?

6937
07:05:50,300 --> 07:05:51,300
I actually can't tell.

6938
07:05:51,300 --> 07:05:52,300
The camera is like...

6939
07:05:52,300 --> 07:05:54,300
I'm sure there's a way to turn off first.

6940
07:05:54,300 --> 07:05:55,300
But...

6941
07:05:55,300 --> 07:05:57,300
Right, we'll follow...

6942
07:05:57,300 --> 07:05:58,300
Our...

6943
07:05:58,300 --> 07:05:59,300
Gated...

6944
07:05:59,300 --> 07:06:01,300
Our gate, our bunny gate.

6945
07:06:01,300 --> 07:06:03,300
A little hopsy.

6946
07:06:04,300 --> 07:06:05,300
I hope I'm right.

6947
07:06:05,300 --> 07:06:06,300
Yeah, okay.

6948
07:06:06,300 --> 07:06:07,300
This is in the...

6949
07:06:07,300 --> 07:06:08,300
The shop.

6950
07:06:08,300 --> 07:06:09,300
Everyone's here.

6951
07:06:11,300 --> 07:06:13,300
We're going to go to the grand exchange

6952
07:06:13,300 --> 07:06:15,300
to make sure everyone has a fly freshen rod

6953
07:06:15,300 --> 07:06:18,300
and to also deposit all of our items

6954
07:06:18,300 --> 07:06:20,300
because our inventory's getting like

6955
07:06:20,300 --> 07:06:21,300
pretty full of stuff.

6956
07:06:21,300 --> 07:06:22,300
And I don't want to be walking around

6957
07:06:22,300 --> 07:06:23,300
with like so much money.

6958
07:06:27,300 --> 07:06:28,300
Oh, there's the brawl.

6959
07:06:28,300 --> 07:06:30,300
This is where we're gonna do a bar brawl.

6960
07:06:31,300 --> 07:06:32,300
In a bar.

6961
07:06:37,300 --> 07:06:38,300
Da-da-da-da-da...

6962
07:06:38,300 --> 07:06:40,300
Do-a-da-da-da...

6963
07:06:40,300 --> 07:06:41,300
Yay, bye!

6964
07:06:42,300 --> 07:06:43,300
Ba-kuh-ba-kuh-ba-inter bolt...

6965
07:06:44,300 --> 07:06:45,300
Ah!

6966
07:06:46,300 --> 07:06:48,300
You can always hover over

6967
07:06:48,300 --> 07:06:49,300
and then just say follow.

6968
07:06:51,300 --> 07:06:52,300
Follow...

6969
07:06:53,300 --> 07:06:54,300
Follow the leader, leader.

6970
07:06:54,300 --> 07:06:55,300
Oh, no, someone got stopped

6971
07:06:55,300 --> 07:06:56,300
by a mysterious old man.

6972
07:06:56,300 --> 07:06:57,300
Oh, you should always talk to

6973
07:06:57,300 --> 07:06:59,300
the mysterious old man

6974
07:06:59,300 --> 07:07:00,300
he'll give you, um...

6975
07:07:01,300 --> 07:07:02,300
Gemstone!

6976
07:07:02,300 --> 07:07:03,300
An uncut gemstone.

6977
07:07:03,300 --> 07:07:04,140
Put James in.

6978
07:07:05,940 --> 07:07:07,100
Okay, we're all ready.

6979
07:07:07,100 --> 07:07:08,660
Follow the leader leader.

6980
07:07:08,660 --> 07:07:11,380
Our ink shall block the sun.

6981
07:07:11,380 --> 07:07:12,740
I have 10 strongies.

6982
07:07:12,740 --> 07:07:14,180
I got some there already.

6983
07:07:14,180 --> 07:07:15,180
Okay, okay, okay.

6984
07:07:19,180 --> 07:07:21,580
Always talk to the mysterious old man, Godot.

6985
07:07:22,460 --> 07:07:24,660
Isn't that in...

6986
07:07:24,660 --> 07:07:27,300
Sometimes he gives you a maze to run through.

6987
07:07:27,300 --> 07:07:28,140
Oh.

6988
07:07:29,380 --> 07:07:31,540
The series old man giving uncut things.

6989
07:07:31,620 --> 07:07:32,460
Say yo.

6990
07:07:35,020 --> 07:07:37,700
The old man can offer to send you to solve a maze

6991
07:07:37,700 --> 07:07:40,060
and that one gives amazing rewards.

6992
07:07:40,060 --> 07:07:41,140
Okay, okay.

6993
07:07:42,060 --> 07:07:44,860
I know the signage lady doesn't give you anything good.

6994
07:07:44,860 --> 07:07:48,300
I'm like 99% sure she gives you a bit of cabbage or something.

6995
07:07:53,220 --> 07:07:55,420
I like this spinning one.

6996
07:07:55,420 --> 07:07:56,380
I can't remember what it is.

6997
07:07:56,380 --> 07:07:57,780
It's like the item spins around

6998
07:07:57,780 --> 07:07:59,740
and you have to identify it or something.

6999
07:07:59,740 --> 07:08:02,460
Amazing rewards.

7000
07:08:05,580 --> 07:08:06,820
Love that maze quest.

7001
07:08:06,820 --> 07:08:07,660
Love it.

7002
07:08:11,220 --> 07:08:13,460
Oh, it's going to skeal him.

7003
07:08:15,460 --> 07:08:17,420
No, it's not getting him.

7004
07:08:17,420 --> 07:08:18,340
Oh, I'm not too...

7005
07:08:18,340 --> 07:08:19,180
Two songs.

7006
07:08:22,140 --> 07:08:22,980
It's terrible.

7007
07:08:22,980 --> 07:08:24,140
It's absolutely terrible.

7008
07:08:30,740 --> 07:08:31,740
Oh, no.

7009
07:08:32,740 --> 07:08:34,740
Our biggest enemy, a bridge.

7010
07:08:34,740 --> 07:08:36,740
Right, we're going to go to the Grand Exchange

7011
07:08:36,740 --> 07:08:38,220
to empty our inventory

7012
07:08:38,220 --> 07:08:42,740
so we only have feathers and a fly fishing rod.

7013
07:08:43,740 --> 07:08:44,740
I don't...

7014
07:08:44,740 --> 07:08:45,740
There's a few fishers.

7015
07:08:45,740 --> 07:08:47,740
I don't know if they're bots or not.

7016
07:08:48,740 --> 07:08:51,740
As long as they're not talking,

7017
07:08:51,740 --> 07:08:53,740
then I think we'll be safe.

7018
07:08:53,740 --> 07:08:56,740
Because I don't want to turn off public traffic.

7019
07:08:57,740 --> 07:08:59,740
Because I don't want to turn off public chat

7020
07:08:59,740 --> 07:09:01,740
because it's fun having you guys talk

7021
07:09:01,740 --> 07:09:03,740
both in-game and in-stream.

7022
07:09:03,740 --> 07:09:05,740
It's where the real fishing begins.

7023
07:09:05,740 --> 07:09:08,740
The seventh grade computer lab day fishing.

7024
07:09:09,740 --> 07:09:10,740
Is it terrible?

7025
07:09:10,740 --> 07:09:12,740
No one is going to argue she wasn't that one.

7026
07:09:14,740 --> 07:09:17,740
Right, we're back at the Grand Exchange.

7027
07:09:22,740 --> 07:09:25,740
Right, where's the reefling that has the rods we desire?

7028
07:09:25,740 --> 07:09:28,740
For those reeflings who don't have a rod, please...

7029
07:09:29,740 --> 07:09:31,740
Reach out to...

7030
07:09:32,740 --> 07:09:33,740
To me.

7031
07:09:33,740 --> 07:09:35,740
To Kamin 1000.

7032
07:09:35,740 --> 07:09:37,740
If you don't have a rod...

7033
07:09:37,740 --> 07:09:39,740
I don't know where Kamin is.

7034
07:09:39,740 --> 07:09:40,740
I can't...

7035
07:09:41,740 --> 07:09:43,740
Oh, there, here, here.

7036
07:09:43,740 --> 07:09:44,740
There.

7037
07:09:44,740 --> 07:09:47,740
The one in the smithing cape.

7038
07:09:48,740 --> 07:09:51,740
If you don't have a fly fishing rod, trade then.

7039
07:09:51,740 --> 07:09:53,740
I'm going to put my stuff in the bank.

7040
07:09:53,740 --> 07:09:55,740
Uh, but...

7041
07:09:55,740 --> 07:09:57,740
Uh, this is not enough.

7042
07:09:59,740 --> 07:10:03,740
Let's just put everything in here other than...

7043
07:10:03,740 --> 07:10:05,740
Like, all of these?

7044
07:10:07,740 --> 07:10:08,740
Keep that...

7045
07:10:08,740 --> 07:10:10,740
Wait, why have I not got the money?

7046
07:10:11,740 --> 07:10:13,740
Oh no, I have a bear shield, that's why.

7047
07:10:13,740 --> 07:10:15,740
And then put that away.

7048
07:10:15,740 --> 07:10:16,740
And then put the fishing rod away.

7049
07:10:16,740 --> 07:10:18,740
And then put the money away.

7050
07:10:18,740 --> 07:10:20,740
Oh no, I didn't mean to click that.

7051
07:10:20,740 --> 07:10:21,740
Okay.

7052
07:10:21,740 --> 07:10:23,740
Okay, we did it.

7053
07:10:23,740 --> 07:10:25,740
We're ready to fish and cook.

7054
07:10:25,740 --> 07:10:27,740
Apparently everyone has a rod.

7055
07:10:27,740 --> 07:10:28,740
Jeez.

7056
07:10:29,740 --> 07:10:30,740
It must a...

7057
07:10:30,740 --> 07:10:31,740
A rod?

7058
07:10:32,740 --> 07:10:33,740
A fishing rod.

7059
07:10:34,740 --> 07:10:35,740
It's the mighty of the strange.

7060
07:10:35,740 --> 07:10:37,740
Old women in the forest isn't for...

7061
07:10:37,740 --> 07:10:39,740
Oh, there's so many strange requests.

7062
07:10:40,740 --> 07:10:42,740
Uh, I guess we're ready to take off

7063
07:10:42,740 --> 07:10:44,740
if everyone's emptied their inventory

7064
07:10:44,740 --> 07:10:46,740
and you should have a rod and feathers

7065
07:10:46,740 --> 07:10:48,740
and then we are going to go fishing

7066
07:10:48,740 --> 07:10:50,740
and level up our cooking eggs financially.

7067
07:10:50,740 --> 07:10:51,740
I'm ready.

7068
07:10:51,740 --> 07:10:55,740
All aboard the golden apron train.

7069
07:10:56,740 --> 07:10:58,740
I'll just make sure in case someone's stuck

7070
07:10:58,740 --> 07:10:59,740
at the bank right now.

7071
07:10:59,740 --> 07:11:00,740
It's kind of hard to tell,

7072
07:11:00,740 --> 07:11:01,740
because there's, like, somebody...

7073
07:11:01,740 --> 07:11:02,740
Oh no, there's only...

7074
07:11:03,740 --> 07:11:05,740
Rods are ready, everyone.

7075
07:11:05,740 --> 07:11:07,740
So few female reeflings.

7076
07:11:08,740 --> 07:11:09,740
And...

7077
07:11:09,740 --> 07:11:11,740
It is what it is.

7078
07:11:13,740 --> 07:11:14,740
Oh, wishes to trade with you?

7079
07:11:14,740 --> 07:11:15,740
Okay.

7080
07:11:15,740 --> 07:11:16,740
What's up?

7081
07:11:17,740 --> 07:11:19,740
Are you giving me your...

7082
07:11:19,740 --> 07:11:20,740
Are you giving me your banana?

7083
07:11:20,740 --> 07:11:21,740
Oh, yeah.

7084
07:11:24,740 --> 07:11:25,740
Wait, is this a thing?

7085
07:11:26,740 --> 07:11:27,740
No, it's not.

7086
07:11:27,740 --> 07:11:28,740
Okay.

7087
07:11:28,740 --> 07:11:29,740
I've just been given the banana.

7088
07:11:30,740 --> 07:11:31,740
Did you just finish?

7089
07:11:31,740 --> 07:11:32,740
Be honest.

7090
07:11:32,740 --> 07:11:33,740
Oh, I ate it.

7091
07:11:33,740 --> 07:11:34,740
I'm sorry.

7092
07:11:34,740 --> 07:11:35,740
I just ate it right in front of you.

7093
07:11:35,740 --> 07:11:36,740
I'm sorry.

7094
07:11:36,740 --> 07:11:37,740
I just ate your banana.

7095
07:11:38,740 --> 07:11:39,740
Wait, is that everyone?

7096
07:11:43,740 --> 07:11:45,740
Can I store it somewhere

7097
07:11:45,740 --> 07:11:46,740
or just drop stuff off?

7098
07:11:46,740 --> 07:11:47,740
Oh, yeah.

7099
07:11:47,740 --> 07:11:50,740
So, do you see over here how it says

7100
07:11:50,740 --> 07:11:52,740
bank banker?

7101
07:11:53,740 --> 07:11:55,740
And then click on your inventory

7102
07:11:55,740 --> 07:11:56,740
and it'll put it in the bank.

7103
07:11:56,740 --> 07:11:58,740
So, this empties out your inventory.

7104
07:11:58,740 --> 07:11:59,740
The only thing you want right now

7105
07:11:59,740 --> 07:12:01,740
is a fly fishing rod and feathers.

7106
07:12:02,740 --> 07:12:03,740
Banana or banana?

7107
07:12:05,740 --> 07:12:07,740
It's a treat all over again.

7108
07:12:07,740 --> 07:12:09,740
I actually had a lot of fun making that to me.

7109
07:12:09,740 --> 07:12:10,740
I don't know what it's...

7110
07:12:10,740 --> 07:12:13,740
I don't know if it's gotten more popular or not.

7111
07:12:13,740 --> 07:12:15,740
But when I woke up, it was, like,

7112
07:12:15,740 --> 07:12:16,740
1,000 likes and I'm like,

7113
07:12:16,740 --> 07:12:18,740
ooh, that's a lot, I mean.

7114
07:12:23,740 --> 07:12:25,740
Okay, that should hopefully be it.

7115
07:12:27,740 --> 07:12:29,740
And then we'll take all the reeflings away.

7116
07:12:29,740 --> 07:12:31,740
Actually, we'll...

7117
07:12:31,740 --> 07:12:33,740
Well, I don't know if all the reeflings are ready yet.

7118
07:12:34,740 --> 07:12:35,740
Thank you, God.

7119
07:12:37,740 --> 07:12:41,740
She just ate that man's banana live on public.

7120
07:12:41,740 --> 07:12:43,740
On stream in public in front of everyone.

7121
07:12:44,740 --> 07:12:47,740
Okay, is that all reeflings?

7122
07:12:47,740 --> 07:12:48,740
I like my name so...

7123
07:12:48,740 --> 07:12:50,740
Oh, no, one more, one more.

7124
07:12:51,740 --> 07:12:52,740
There's one more reefling.

7125
07:12:54,740 --> 07:12:55,740
Look at that fit.

7126
07:12:55,740 --> 07:12:57,740
Look at the feet size difference.

7127
07:12:58,740 --> 07:13:00,740
Okay, we now follow

7128
07:13:01,740 --> 07:13:03,740
the reeflings I thought was making a threat

7129
07:13:03,740 --> 07:13:05,740
via the poison in fishfish.

7130
07:13:08,740 --> 07:13:09,740
That video was good.

7131
07:13:10,740 --> 07:13:14,740
Okay, reeflings, we're going to Barbarian Village.

7132
07:13:14,740 --> 07:13:16,740
Hopefully there's no bots talking.

7133
07:13:16,740 --> 07:13:18,740
I'm probably just gonna click ignore

7134
07:13:18,740 --> 07:13:21,740
if there's any bots so we don't have to world hop

7135
07:13:21,740 --> 07:13:23,740
because this is a pretty quiet world in general.

7136
07:13:24,740 --> 07:13:25,740
Yeah, it was great.

7137
07:13:25,740 --> 07:13:26,740
I lost that video.

7138
07:13:27,740 --> 07:13:28,740
Really?

7139
07:13:30,740 --> 07:13:33,740
I was, like, wondering should I, like, overcomplement...

7140
07:13:33,740 --> 07:13:35,740
overcomplicate it and, like, say,

7141
07:13:35,740 --> 07:13:36,740
like, certain words, phrase or whatever.

7142
07:13:36,740 --> 07:13:37,740
And I was, like, no.

7143
07:13:37,740 --> 07:13:39,740
Just be super simple about it.

7144
07:13:39,740 --> 07:13:40,740
So I was...

7145
07:13:42,740 --> 07:13:43,740
Did it.

7146
07:13:45,740 --> 07:13:46,740
Right.

7147
07:13:46,740 --> 07:13:50,740
Okay, so this is Barbarian fishing section.

7148
07:13:50,740 --> 07:13:54,740
It's normally bought it, but I don't know.

7149
07:13:54,740 --> 07:13:55,740
These may be real people.

7150
07:13:55,740 --> 07:13:58,740
This is the best, like, free-to-play area.

7151
07:13:58,740 --> 07:13:59,740
We'll do here.

7152
07:13:59,740 --> 07:14:01,740
We'll lure our fishing rod.

7153
07:14:03,740 --> 07:14:04,740
And how are you a cow?

7154
07:14:04,740 --> 07:14:06,740
You were a bunny a second ago.

7155
07:14:08,740 --> 07:14:10,740
Oh, I've already caught a fish.

7156
07:14:11,740 --> 07:14:13,740
Whoa, the fishing is so fast.

7157
07:14:15,740 --> 07:14:18,740
Oh, my God, really gonna be levelling up so quickly.

7158
07:14:24,740 --> 07:14:26,740
Well, once whatever you catch,

7159
07:14:26,740 --> 07:14:29,740
there's a pair of my fire over here that we can cook on.

7160
07:14:30,740 --> 07:14:33,740
Everyone did get level 20 fishing, right?

7161
07:14:33,740 --> 07:14:35,740
Or I've just dragged you over here for nothing.

7162
07:14:37,740 --> 07:14:39,740
I hope everyone's...

7163
07:14:42,740 --> 07:14:44,740
Oh, you're all up to 20?

7164
07:14:51,740 --> 07:14:53,740
Oh, no, I thought everyone was 20 fishing.

7165
07:14:53,740 --> 07:14:54,740
I'm so sorry.

7166
07:14:56,740 --> 07:14:58,740
Oh, I'm not level 20.

7167
07:14:58,740 --> 07:14:59,740
No.

7168
07:15:02,740 --> 07:15:05,740
My suggestion, if you're not level 20,

7169
07:15:05,740 --> 07:15:08,740
you need to get that net and go back to the thing.

7170
07:15:08,740 --> 07:15:09,740
I joined late.

7171
07:15:09,740 --> 07:15:11,740
I'll level in dreams night later.

7172
07:15:13,740 --> 07:15:15,740
Not me, but I'll jump over and get a quick view of it.

7173
07:15:17,740 --> 07:15:19,740
Oh, no, there's a banana on the floor.

7174
07:15:19,740 --> 07:15:20,740
Random banana.

7175
07:15:25,740 --> 07:15:28,740
So, only that video in your altar is one of the hottest.

7176
07:15:28,740 --> 07:15:29,740
Oh.

7177
07:15:32,740 --> 07:15:33,740
How many likes is that?

7178
07:15:33,740 --> 07:15:35,740
I'm allowed to know.

7179
07:15:36,740 --> 07:15:38,740
If you aren't level 20,

7180
07:15:38,740 --> 07:15:42,740
I would suggest going back to Lumbridge.

7181
07:15:42,740 --> 07:15:44,740
Teleport to Lumbridge.

7182
07:15:44,740 --> 07:15:47,740
Get your small fishing net out the bank at the top

7183
07:15:47,740 --> 07:15:50,740
and then go back to that spot until you're 20.

7184
07:15:50,740 --> 07:15:52,740
And then coming here...

7185
07:15:53,740 --> 07:15:54,740
Well, I'm already level 21.

7186
07:15:54,740 --> 07:15:56,740
Jesus, so much faster doing this.

7187
07:15:56,740 --> 07:15:57,740
It's crazy.

7188
07:15:58,740 --> 07:15:59,740
Is that 1.4?

7189
07:15:59,740 --> 07:16:00,740
Okay, we'll go.

7190
07:16:01,740 --> 07:16:03,740
How long has people enjoyed it?

7191
07:16:03,740 --> 07:16:04,740
That's the main thing.

7192
07:16:08,740 --> 07:16:10,740
What level to bait fish here?

7193
07:16:10,740 --> 07:16:12,740
I'm not sure.

7194
07:16:12,740 --> 07:16:14,740
I only brought feathers for fly fish.

7195
07:16:17,740 --> 07:16:18,740
No comment.

7196
07:16:24,740 --> 07:16:26,740
Should I do a burp at the end of one of them?

7197
07:16:26,740 --> 07:16:27,740
Maybe I should.

7198
07:16:27,740 --> 07:16:28,740
They're like a burp version.

7199
07:16:31,740 --> 07:16:32,740
Hmm.

7200
07:16:34,740 --> 07:16:35,740
But yes.

7201
07:16:36,740 --> 07:16:39,740
We're probably going to be here for like a hot second.

7202
07:16:40,740 --> 07:16:43,740
Mercy's going up in an hour 40.

7203
07:16:43,740 --> 07:16:45,740
So honestly, I think for the rest of the stream,

7204
07:16:45,740 --> 07:16:46,740
we're going to be here.

7205
07:16:46,740 --> 07:16:48,740
So if you want to level up to 20 cooking,

7206
07:16:48,740 --> 07:16:50,740
you certainly can.

7207
07:16:50,740 --> 07:16:52,740
Sorry, 20 fishing.

7208
07:16:52,740 --> 07:16:54,740
And then like come back here.

7209
07:16:54,740 --> 07:16:56,740
Like we'll probably most likely be here.

7210
07:16:57,740 --> 07:17:02,740
And hopefully I can stop burning fish

7211
07:17:02,740 --> 07:17:04,740
and then I can start burning through the supplies

7212
07:17:04,740 --> 07:17:06,740
that were gifted because like I think I got like

7213
07:17:06,740 --> 07:17:08,740
2000 fish gifted to me.

7214
07:17:08,740 --> 07:17:09,740
I'll be back.

7215
07:17:09,740 --> 07:17:10,740
Good luck.

7216
07:17:10,740 --> 07:17:11,740
Yeah.

7217
07:17:11,740 --> 07:17:12,740
Have a good time.

7218
07:17:12,740 --> 07:17:15,740
You can teleport via your magic spells.

7219
07:17:15,740 --> 07:17:17,740
Get on to, yeah.

7220
07:17:17,740 --> 07:17:20,740
Get to Lumberge again and do that small thing

7221
07:17:20,740 --> 07:17:23,740
and then come back here once you've got your fly fishing rod.

7222
07:17:23,740 --> 07:17:25,740
And I've got loads of feathers on me.

7223
07:17:26,740 --> 07:17:27,740
Yeah.

7224
07:17:32,740 --> 07:17:34,740
This is where the ground begins.

7225
07:17:34,740 --> 07:17:37,740
We are currently at 25 cooking.

7226
07:17:37,740 --> 07:17:38,740
Which is decent.

7227
07:17:38,740 --> 07:17:40,740
I wanted to get 40 before stream.

7228
07:17:40,740 --> 07:17:43,740
I think 40 is part of that cow animation.

7229
07:17:43,740 --> 07:17:47,740
I think 40 is 40 realistic before

7230
07:17:47,740 --> 07:17:49,740
Mercy goes live.

7231
07:17:49,740 --> 07:17:50,740
I'm not sure.

7232
07:17:50,740 --> 07:17:51,740
I'm not sure.

7233
07:17:51,740 --> 07:17:53,740
Bait fishing is 25.

7234
07:17:53,740 --> 07:17:54,740
Oh, that's even worse.

7235
07:17:54,740 --> 07:17:58,740
How do you get grapes, actually?

7236
07:17:58,740 --> 07:18:00,740
From the Grand Exchange?

7237
07:18:00,740 --> 07:18:03,740
I don't actually know where you harvest them.

7238
07:18:07,740 --> 07:18:08,740
Tea time.

7239
07:18:09,740 --> 07:18:11,740
We're actually going to get decent level in fishing.

7240
07:18:11,740 --> 07:18:12,740
Yeah.

7241
07:18:12,740 --> 07:18:13,740
Whoa.

7242
07:18:13,740 --> 07:18:14,740
It's 50 eggs per fish.

7243
07:18:14,740 --> 07:18:16,740
That's quite a lot.

7244
07:18:16,740 --> 07:18:18,740
All things considered.

7245
07:18:18,740 --> 07:18:21,740
I'm going to level up in fishing again

7246
07:18:21,740 --> 07:18:23,740
on this one stalk of inland water.

7247
07:18:25,740 --> 07:18:26,740
Yeah.

7248
07:18:31,740 --> 07:18:34,740
Oh, that's a lot of trout on the floor.

7249
07:18:34,740 --> 07:18:37,740
That's literally 10k worth of fish.

7250
07:18:37,740 --> 07:18:41,740
13k XP per hour.

7251
07:18:41,740 --> 07:18:42,740
If you don't cook the fish.

7252
07:18:42,740 --> 07:18:44,740
Yeah, we're going to have to stop and use this fire.

7253
07:18:44,740 --> 07:18:48,740
But this is a permanent fire that we can utilize for ourselves.

7254
07:18:48,740 --> 07:18:50,740
Which is fantastic.

7255
07:18:51,740 --> 07:18:53,740
Would it make sense to just buy them in bulk?

7256
07:18:53,740 --> 07:18:56,740
Yeah, especially if you do that route and just buy 66.

7257
07:18:56,740 --> 07:18:59,740
Oh, that would be daunting.

7258
07:18:59,740 --> 07:19:02,740
But it's definitely a possibility.

7259
07:19:08,740 --> 07:19:13,740
I'm wondering, maybe we could do react andy content.

7260
07:19:15,740 --> 07:19:18,740
I don't know if there's stuff that's safe for YouTube reaction.

7261
07:19:18,740 --> 07:19:20,740
Whilst we do this.

7262
07:19:20,740 --> 07:19:22,740
Because don't get me wrong.

7263
07:19:22,740 --> 07:19:23,740
I'm entertaining.

7264
07:19:23,740 --> 07:19:28,740
But I don't think I'm that entertaining for like a 30 hour grind.

7265
07:19:28,740 --> 07:19:30,740
If I was doing grapes.

7266
07:19:32,740 --> 07:19:34,740
Oh, just do the last one.

7267
07:19:35,740 --> 07:19:40,740
So maybe we put stuff on in the background.

7268
07:19:42,740 --> 07:19:46,740
70 eggs pee for cooking trout.

7269
07:19:46,740 --> 07:19:48,740
Whoa.

7270
07:19:50,740 --> 07:19:52,740
That's so fast.

7271
07:19:52,740 --> 07:19:55,740
We're literally 26 already.

7272
07:19:56,740 --> 07:19:58,740
That is so fast.

7273
07:19:58,740 --> 07:20:00,740
We need Minecraft parkour.

7274
07:20:00,740 --> 07:20:03,740
Subway surfers in the bottom stream.

7275
07:20:06,740 --> 07:20:08,740
70 is so much.

7276
07:20:08,740 --> 07:20:11,740
When we unlock salmon, I don't even know how much salmon is.

7277
07:20:11,740 --> 07:20:13,740
XP wise.

7278
07:20:13,740 --> 07:20:15,740
Oh, stop burning it.

7279
07:20:15,740 --> 07:20:17,740
Stop burning it.

7280
07:20:21,740 --> 07:20:23,740
Oh.

7281
07:20:29,740 --> 07:20:32,740
Just put some surfers in the corner.

7282
07:20:36,740 --> 07:20:39,740
Yeah, so this is like free grinding as well.

7283
07:20:39,740 --> 07:20:41,740
To pick up this fish that people drop.

7284
07:20:43,740 --> 07:20:47,740
Oh, we literally went on two cooking levels doing one batch of fish.

7285
07:20:47,740 --> 07:20:49,740
That's crazy.

7286
07:20:51,740 --> 07:20:53,740
I'm so fast.

7287
07:20:56,740 --> 07:20:58,740
Here, fishy fishy.

7288
07:20:58,740 --> 07:21:00,740
We need to be quiet.

7289
07:21:00,740 --> 07:21:02,740
Salmon or 90 cooking eggs pee.

7290
07:21:02,740 --> 07:21:04,740
Okay, that will be good.

7291
07:21:04,740 --> 07:21:07,740
I'll listen to you whenever, but I've lost my mind entirely.

7292
07:21:07,740 --> 07:21:09,740
See you tomorrow. Rest well.

7293
07:21:09,740 --> 07:21:11,740
Please rest well.

7294
07:21:11,740 --> 07:21:13,740
Gotta get up tomorrow with Khan.

7295
07:21:13,740 --> 07:21:15,740
Oh, fun time.

7296
07:21:15,740 --> 07:21:17,740
Oh my god, it's Rinscape in real life.

7297
07:21:18,740 --> 07:21:20,740
It's trying to get easily watched.

7298
07:21:20,740 --> 07:21:22,740
There has been nothing but yapping.

7299
07:21:22,740 --> 07:21:24,740
It's because of my voice.

7300
07:21:24,740 --> 07:21:26,740
It's so sore.

7301
07:21:26,740 --> 07:21:28,740
My face meant no dragon.

7302
07:21:28,740 --> 07:21:30,740
Harpoon specking on free world.

7303
07:21:30,740 --> 07:21:32,740
Oof.

7304
07:21:38,740 --> 07:21:41,740
Wow, wow, wow.

7305
07:21:41,740 --> 07:21:44,740
I haven't seen it for a while.

7306
07:21:44,740 --> 07:21:46,740
Honestly, we...

7307
07:21:46,740 --> 07:21:49,740
We thought we were going to do 40 before Mercy comes on,

7308
07:21:49,740 --> 07:21:53,740
but we managed to like fish to high heaven.

7309
07:21:53,740 --> 07:21:55,740
We might be past 40.

7310
07:21:55,740 --> 07:21:57,740
I don't know. I don't want to jinx it, but...

7311
07:21:57,740 --> 07:22:01,740
40 on the first Rinscape stream seems pretty decent work.

7312
07:22:01,740 --> 07:22:03,740
And we also did fun questing.

7313
07:22:06,740 --> 07:22:08,740
We got how many quests?

7314
07:22:08,740 --> 07:22:10,740
One, two...

7315
07:22:10,740 --> 07:22:12,740
I'm gonna go so fast.

7316
07:22:12,740 --> 07:22:14,740
One, two...

7317
07:22:14,740 --> 07:22:16,740
Three, four, five...

7318
07:22:16,740 --> 07:22:18,740
Six and seven.

7319
07:22:18,740 --> 07:22:20,740
Well, maybe do...

7320
07:22:20,740 --> 07:22:22,740
A few more.

7321
07:22:22,740 --> 07:22:24,740
23!

7322
07:22:24,740 --> 07:22:27,740
Got overtime tomorrow, so I'm gonna have to...

7323
07:22:27,740 --> 07:22:29,740
So I have plenty of listening time.

7324
07:22:31,740 --> 07:22:33,740
For anyone that needs to go to sleep

7325
07:22:33,740 --> 07:22:35,740
or you need to go do some things,

7326
07:22:35,740 --> 07:22:37,740
please do not worry. You're not missing out on much.

7327
07:22:37,740 --> 07:22:40,740
This is literally the gameplay for the next hour and a half.

7328
07:22:40,740 --> 07:22:42,740
I'm not even kidding.

7329
07:22:42,740 --> 07:22:44,740
We're just fishing and then a...

7330
07:22:44,740 --> 07:22:46,740
We're catching the fish and then cooking them

7331
07:22:46,740 --> 07:22:48,740
and then leveling up cooking.

7332
07:22:48,740 --> 07:22:50,740
Are you squidding me right now?

7333
07:22:50,740 --> 07:22:51,740
Brian!

7334
07:22:55,740 --> 07:22:57,740
Hi Tiny Spinny!

7335
07:22:57,740 --> 07:22:59,740
Hope you had fun at work.

7336
07:22:59,740 --> 07:23:02,740
We are currently in World 3A

7337
07:23:02,740 --> 07:23:05,740
and we are in Barbarian Village.

7338
07:23:05,740 --> 07:23:07,740
We're fishing.

7339
07:23:07,740 --> 07:23:09,740
So the Grand Exchange,

7340
07:23:09,740 --> 07:23:11,740
Varrock, Telopore,

7341
07:23:11,740 --> 07:23:13,740
and we're at the fishing village.

7342
07:23:13,740 --> 07:23:15,740
We have a fly fishing rod

7343
07:23:15,740 --> 07:23:17,740
and we have a feather

7344
07:23:17,740 --> 07:23:19,740
and we're catching the fish and cooking them

7345
07:23:19,740 --> 07:23:21,740
on the perma...

7346
07:23:21,740 --> 07:23:23,740
cookie thing.

7347
07:23:23,740 --> 07:23:25,740
Once I'm experienced enough

7348
07:23:25,740 --> 07:23:27,740
not to burn fish,

7349
07:23:27,740 --> 07:23:29,740
I most likely will cook all the fish

7350
07:23:29,740 --> 07:23:31,740
that the reeflings gave me

7351
07:23:31,740 --> 07:23:33,740
because I don't want them to go to waste

7352
07:23:33,740 --> 07:23:35,740
because that was a lot of money

7353
07:23:35,740 --> 07:23:37,740
that the reeflings handed me.

7354
07:23:38,740 --> 07:23:40,740
I don't...

7355
07:23:40,740 --> 07:23:41,740
I'll cook all of that

7356
07:23:41,740 --> 07:23:42,740
and see where we are.

7357
07:23:42,740 --> 07:23:44,740
I think lobsters...

7358
07:23:44,740 --> 07:23:46,740
I've got quite a few lobsters.

7359
07:23:46,740 --> 07:23:48,740
Trout, salmon, all of that.

7360
07:23:48,740 --> 07:23:50,740
So we're going to cook all of that.

7361
07:23:50,740 --> 07:23:53,740
I don't think we're going to be on Wains

7362
07:23:53,740 --> 07:23:55,740
by the time Mercy comes on.

7363
07:23:58,740 --> 07:24:01,740
I think tomorrow's my eighth more stream.

7364
07:24:02,740 --> 07:24:04,740
So I definitely need to try and rest my voice

7365
07:24:04,740 --> 07:24:06,740
so that it's going to be so smooth.

7366
07:24:07,740 --> 07:24:09,740
I'm ready for another 2AM YAP session.

7367
07:24:09,740 --> 07:24:11,740
We're listening to the Scottish last.

7368
07:24:12,740 --> 07:24:13,740
I've got plenty of YAP

7369
07:24:13,740 --> 07:24:14,740
and we're like, I'm slow.

7370
07:24:14,740 --> 07:24:16,740
Oh, someone's got a mini...

7371
07:24:17,740 --> 07:24:18,740
mini quest.

7372
07:24:18,740 --> 07:24:19,740
A toot!

7373
07:24:19,740 --> 07:24:21,740
A toot free power.

7374
07:24:21,740 --> 07:24:22,740
A toot free power.

7375
07:24:29,740 --> 07:24:30,740
Such a tent feeling free.

7376
07:24:30,740 --> 07:24:31,740
Oh my God, it's so intense.

7377
07:24:31,740 --> 07:24:33,740
Wait, I'm not even fishing anyone.

7378
07:24:33,740 --> 07:24:35,740
That's probably the only thing that kills me

7379
07:24:35,740 --> 07:24:36,740
about this game,

7380
07:24:36,740 --> 07:24:38,740
like when it comes to fishing and stuff.

7381
07:24:38,740 --> 07:24:40,740
It's when the boxes move.

7382
07:24:42,740 --> 07:24:44,740
But it is very tempting to,

7383
07:24:46,740 --> 07:24:48,740
like, pick up all the fish that are already here

7384
07:24:48,740 --> 07:24:50,740
and just do that and spawn that.

7385
07:24:50,740 --> 07:24:52,740
Lobsters require 40 cookies

7386
07:24:52,740 --> 07:24:53,740
so it might be a while.

7387
07:24:53,740 --> 07:24:54,740
I don't want to burn them.

7388
07:24:55,740 --> 07:24:57,740
Here we are going to 4AM.

7389
07:24:57,740 --> 07:24:58,740
I'm ready for...

7390
07:24:59,740 --> 07:25:02,740
Yes, so if you want to join in

7391
07:25:02,740 --> 07:25:03,740
some say hi.

7392
07:25:03,740 --> 07:25:05,740
World 380

7393
07:25:05,740 --> 07:25:07,740
and Barbarian Village Fishing Sport.

7394
07:25:07,740 --> 07:25:08,740
Free to play.

7395
07:25:08,740 --> 07:25:09,740
Free to play.

7396
07:25:09,740 --> 07:25:11,740
Well, cheeky free to play.

7397
07:25:12,740 --> 07:25:15,740
If I get the RuneScape...

7398
07:25:16,740 --> 07:25:19,740
If I do end up getting the Cookin' Cape,

7399
07:25:19,740 --> 07:25:20,740
we might take a break

7400
07:25:20,740 --> 07:25:22,740
but I wouldn't mind doing membership quests

7401
07:25:22,740 --> 07:25:23,740
at some point

7402
07:25:23,740 --> 07:25:25,740
because I've never actually done them

7403
07:25:25,740 --> 07:25:26,740
and I'm too scared to do them on my own

7404
07:25:26,740 --> 07:25:27,740
but if you guys are with me,

7405
07:25:27,740 --> 07:25:28,740
I'm not scared.

7406
07:25:29,740 --> 07:25:32,740
Yes, I think tomorrow's ASMR stream

7407
07:25:32,740 --> 07:25:35,740
and then day after is trying sweet.

7408
07:25:37,740 --> 07:25:39,740
And then after is Skyrim

7409
07:25:39,740 --> 07:25:40,740
and I get to rant...

7410
07:25:40,740 --> 07:25:41,740
No, not rant, sorry.

7411
07:25:41,740 --> 07:25:45,740
I get to mumble away about Skyrim for ages.

7412
07:25:46,740 --> 07:25:49,740
Lobsters have a 60% chance to burn at level 40.

7413
07:25:49,740 --> 07:25:51,740
Yeah, I'm not wasting Lobsters there.

7414
07:25:52,740 --> 07:25:54,740
That is rough.

7415
07:25:54,740 --> 07:25:55,740
That's rough.

7416
07:25:56,740 --> 07:25:58,740
I don't want to waste a lot of weight

7417
07:25:58,740 --> 07:26:00,740
because that was so much better rather than...

7418
07:26:00,740 --> 07:26:03,740
But we're like leveling up our fishing so easily.

7419
07:26:05,740 --> 07:26:07,740
Right, we are full.

7420
07:26:07,740 --> 07:26:09,740
Let's see, can we get two levels out of this

7421
07:26:09,740 --> 07:26:10,740
if we don't burn them?

7422
07:26:10,740 --> 07:26:12,740
It burns the first one.

7423
07:26:15,740 --> 07:26:16,740
Dude, waterfall fires.

7424
07:26:16,740 --> 07:26:18,740
It gets you to combat level 30.

7425
07:26:18,740 --> 07:26:19,740
What?

7426
07:26:19,740 --> 07:26:20,740
Really?

7427
07:26:21,740 --> 07:26:22,740
I know I got some quests

7428
07:26:22,740 --> 07:26:24,740
really give you a lot of XP

7429
07:26:24,740 --> 07:26:26,740
but I can't wait for those more

7430
07:26:26,740 --> 07:26:27,740
but I'm lucky for the time.

7431
07:26:27,740 --> 07:26:29,740
Maybe I'll cast a bit later.

7432
07:26:33,740 --> 07:26:35,740
Don't worry if you can't make it to any stream.

7433
07:26:35,740 --> 07:26:36,740
I think the boss will stay up

7434
07:26:36,740 --> 07:26:39,740
and I'm not going to be doing ear licking

7435
07:26:39,740 --> 07:26:42,740
because something weird is going on with YouTube.

7436
07:26:43,740 --> 07:26:45,740
It's going on a little weird with YouTube

7437
07:26:45,740 --> 07:26:46,740
and I don't know what's going on

7438
07:26:46,740 --> 07:26:48,740
so I'm not risking it.

7439
07:26:49,740 --> 07:26:52,740
As I gave you all those lobs

7440
07:26:52,740 --> 07:26:54,740
you can burn them if you need to.

7441
07:26:56,740 --> 07:26:58,740
I'd rather not waste the XP

7442
07:26:58,740 --> 07:27:00,740
like if it was potential full XP

7443
07:27:00,740 --> 07:27:03,740
like it's okay to burn these trout for example.

7444
07:27:05,740 --> 07:27:07,740
Oh come on, one more and I'll level up.

7445
07:27:07,740 --> 07:27:08,740
Okay, there we go.

7446
07:27:09,740 --> 07:27:10,740
20.

7447
07:27:10,740 --> 07:27:11,740
Aw yeah.

7448
07:27:12,740 --> 07:27:14,740
I want 40 before Mercy comes online.

7449
07:27:14,740 --> 07:27:16,740
We're under the cock roof limbs.

7450
07:27:18,740 --> 07:27:19,740
We're under the cock.

7451
07:27:20,740 --> 07:27:21,740
Empty inventory.

7452
07:27:21,740 --> 07:27:22,740
Let's get it.

7453
07:27:22,740 --> 07:27:23,740
I don't know if I should fish

7454
07:27:23,740 --> 07:27:25,740
or if I should honestly

7455
07:27:25,740 --> 07:27:27,740
just put my stuff away and pick up

7456
07:27:27,740 --> 07:27:28,740
but if everyone was picking up

7457
07:27:28,740 --> 07:27:29,740
what was put on the floor

7458
07:27:29,740 --> 07:27:32,740
then we wouldn't have enough trout to go around.

7459
07:27:38,740 --> 07:27:40,740
Where would be the first ASMR?

7460
07:27:40,740 --> 07:27:42,740
Hopefully YouTube will get off.

7461
07:27:44,740 --> 07:27:46,740
No, it's like cracking down everywhere

7462
07:27:46,740 --> 07:27:48,740
on anime ASMR in particular.

7463
07:27:48,740 --> 07:27:51,740
If you want to call it anime ASMR.

7464
07:27:53,740 --> 07:27:55,740
It'll be faster to loot the fish

7465
07:27:55,740 --> 07:27:57,740
if you just want to do a cooking.

7466
07:27:57,740 --> 07:27:59,740
That's what I'm thinking.

7467
07:28:00,740 --> 07:28:02,740
If I just do that instead.

7468
07:28:06,740 --> 07:28:08,740
It's nice to get the level of XP

7469
07:28:08,740 --> 07:28:11,740
but I'm gonna like blast the head of you reeflings

7470
07:28:11,740 --> 07:28:12,740
if I do that.

7471
07:28:12,740 --> 07:28:14,740
Would you guys be upset if I picked up trout?

7472
07:28:15,740 --> 07:28:16,740
Hopefully not.

7473
07:28:17,740 --> 07:28:19,740
It would blast me forward though.

7474
07:28:19,740 --> 07:28:21,740
Like, compared to everyone's level.

7475
07:28:27,740 --> 07:28:28,740
Go for it.

7476
07:28:31,740 --> 07:28:32,740
What do I need?

7477
07:28:32,740 --> 07:28:33,740
I just need trout.

7478
07:28:33,740 --> 07:28:34,740
I can't cook salmon

7479
07:28:34,740 --> 07:28:35,740
because I'm too low level.

7480
07:28:35,740 --> 07:28:37,740
Wait, examine?

7481
07:28:38,740 --> 07:28:40,740
No, I don't want salmon.

7482
07:28:40,740 --> 07:28:41,740
I can't cook it.

7483
07:28:42,740 --> 07:28:43,740
I want trout.

7484
07:28:44,740 --> 07:28:45,740
Right.

7485
07:28:45,740 --> 07:28:47,740
We'll see how far this gets me ahead

7486
07:28:47,740 --> 07:28:49,740
if I do this method where I don't fish.

7487
07:28:49,740 --> 07:28:52,740
Maybe you guys can drop the fish for me

7488
07:28:52,740 --> 07:28:54,740
and we get fish train going.

7489
07:28:54,740 --> 07:28:55,740
There's two more.

7490
07:28:56,740 --> 07:28:57,740
Right, let's cook this batch.

7491
07:28:57,740 --> 07:28:59,740
Let's see what happens.

7492
07:28:59,740 --> 07:29:01,740
I like fish.

7493
07:29:01,740 --> 07:29:03,740
The fish are so amazing too.

7494
07:29:06,740 --> 07:29:08,740
Basically, if you can't see what they're actually doing

7495
07:29:08,740 --> 07:29:09,740
they're assuming it's like,

7496
07:29:09,740 --> 07:29:11,740
Yes, I think that's what the problem is.

7497
07:29:11,740 --> 07:29:12,740
Why?

7498
07:29:12,740 --> 07:29:13,740
In real life it's fine,

7499
07:29:13,740 --> 07:29:15,740
but anime's getting wapped with it.

7500
07:29:17,740 --> 07:29:18,740
I say anime,

7501
07:29:18,740 --> 07:29:19,740
beach over animation.

7502
07:29:19,740 --> 07:29:20,740
You know what I mean.

7503
07:29:21,740 --> 07:29:23,740
Anyway, it starts blasting.

7504
07:29:25,740 --> 07:29:27,740
We're fish slaves, let's go.

7505
07:29:28,740 --> 07:29:30,740
Sounds a bit fishy, but okay.

7506
07:29:37,740 --> 07:29:38,740
Are we gonna make it?

7507
07:29:38,740 --> 07:29:39,740
I think we are.

7508
07:29:40,740 --> 07:29:41,740
I said this.

7509
07:29:43,740 --> 07:29:45,740
No idea when I said that.

7510
07:29:48,740 --> 07:29:49,740
29 already?

7511
07:29:49,740 --> 07:29:51,740
Oh my god, this is so fast.

7512
07:29:51,740 --> 07:29:53,740
I'm saying it's fast now

7513
07:29:53,740 --> 07:29:55,740
because it's gonna be so slow later,

7514
07:29:55,740 --> 07:29:56,740
but I'm happy.

7515
07:29:57,740 --> 07:30:00,740
I only burnt four from that batch as well.

7516
07:30:00,740 --> 07:30:04,740
That trout is getting cooked to perfection by me, honestly.

7517
07:30:05,740 --> 07:30:07,740
I see trout, I see trout.

7518
07:30:10,740 --> 07:30:12,740
I don't know, those are cooked trout.

7519
07:30:13,740 --> 07:30:15,740
Right, I'm gonna have to fish and go fish.

7520
07:30:15,740 --> 07:30:17,740
Oh wait, someone wants to trade with me, hold on.

7521
07:30:21,740 --> 07:30:23,740
You'll never guess what.

7522
07:30:23,740 --> 07:30:24,740
It's trout.

7523
07:30:28,740 --> 07:30:29,740
Oh no, you cancelled.

7524
07:30:29,740 --> 07:30:31,740
Oh, you don't have enough inspiratory space.

7525
07:30:31,740 --> 07:30:32,740
Oh no, sorry.

7526
07:30:33,740 --> 07:30:35,740
I don't know how many I've got left.

7527
07:30:35,740 --> 07:30:36,740
Like,

7528
07:30:37,740 --> 07:30:39,740
space for freaking...

7529
07:30:39,740 --> 07:30:40,740
Yeah.

7530
07:30:42,740 --> 07:30:44,740
Trade modified.

7531
07:30:44,740 --> 07:30:45,740
Blink, blink, blink.

7532
07:30:45,740 --> 07:30:47,740
I saw serious, literally.

7533
07:30:47,740 --> 07:30:48,740
I don't know if that's too much.

7534
07:30:48,740 --> 07:30:49,740
Oh no.

7535
07:30:49,740 --> 07:30:50,740
Is it?

7536
07:30:50,740 --> 07:30:51,740
Oh, you failed me.

7537
07:30:51,740 --> 07:30:52,740
Oh, my inventory.

7538
07:30:52,740 --> 07:30:53,740
You failed my inventory.

7539
07:30:53,740 --> 07:30:55,740
Thank you, beef knife.

7540
07:31:01,740 --> 07:31:02,740
That's terrible.

7541
07:31:02,740 --> 07:31:04,740
But thank you very much, we've blown.

7542
07:31:04,740 --> 07:31:06,740
It's running out of here playing cooking, mummy.

7543
07:31:06,740 --> 07:31:07,740
Literally, I'm feeding.

7544
07:31:07,740 --> 07:31:11,740
You don't get 100% success on trout until 49.

7545
07:31:11,740 --> 07:31:12,740
That's so rough.

7546
07:31:12,740 --> 07:31:14,740
I don't remember it being so like that.

7547
07:31:26,740 --> 07:31:28,740
We're already gonna level up again.

7548
07:31:30,740 --> 07:31:32,740
I don't know when we unlock being able to cook salmon,

7549
07:31:32,740 --> 07:31:33,740
but it's gonna be soon.

7550
07:31:33,740 --> 07:31:36,740
Gonna drop all the trout in the south spot of salmon here.

7551
07:31:36,740 --> 07:31:37,740
Yeah.

7552
07:31:37,740 --> 07:31:39,740
If you don't overlap on the salmon,

7553
07:31:39,740 --> 07:31:41,740
it makes it so easy to pick up.

7554
07:31:41,740 --> 07:31:43,740
Wow, we're already up there.

7555
07:31:43,740 --> 07:31:44,740
Oh my god.

7556
07:31:44,740 --> 07:31:46,740
Are we gonna be 50 by the time mercy?

7557
07:31:48,740 --> 07:31:50,740
We may, honestly.

7558
07:31:53,740 --> 07:31:55,740
I'm cooking by gas.

7559
07:31:55,740 --> 07:31:57,740
I'm cooking the best I can.

7560
07:31:57,740 --> 07:31:59,740
Okay, we had like way more burnt in that batch,

7561
07:31:59,740 --> 07:32:01,740
so it really is just randomized.

7562
07:32:02,740 --> 07:32:04,740
Let's empty our inventory,

7563
07:32:04,740 --> 07:32:06,740
and then let's grab all these trout.

7564
07:32:13,740 --> 07:32:15,740
I'm over there, hating.

7565
07:32:15,740 --> 07:32:17,740
Oh wait, sorry.

7566
07:32:19,740 --> 07:32:21,740
I don't know if you have to take into account

7567
07:32:21,740 --> 07:32:24,740
how much inventory space I have.

7568
07:32:27,740 --> 07:32:28,740
Okay.

7569
07:32:28,740 --> 07:32:29,740
Yeah.

7570
07:32:29,740 --> 07:32:32,740
As long as you put whatever inventory.

7571
07:32:38,740 --> 07:32:41,740
Oh my god.

7572
07:32:41,740 --> 07:32:43,740
Loves yourself six percent.

7573
07:32:45,740 --> 07:32:48,740
The key to power leveling is slave teamwork.

7574
07:32:48,740 --> 07:32:51,740
Honestly, we're doing pretty good.

7575
07:32:52,740 --> 07:32:55,740
We're already launching the 30s.

7576
07:32:56,740 --> 07:33:00,740
I think we can fly past the 40s, honestly.

7577
07:33:00,740 --> 07:33:01,740
Hi, Stronia.

7578
07:33:01,740 --> 07:33:02,740
Been away from us today.

7579
07:33:02,740 --> 07:33:04,740
How's it going?

7580
07:33:04,740 --> 07:33:08,740
We have done some quests, some free play quests.

7581
07:33:08,740 --> 07:33:11,740
We are currently at Barbarian Village,

7582
07:33:11,740 --> 07:33:15,740
and I'm currently using the reflames

7583
07:33:15,740 --> 07:33:17,740
to slave fish for me,

7584
07:33:17,740 --> 07:33:18,740
so we're getting trout,

7585
07:33:18,740 --> 07:33:22,740
and I'm currently leveling up like crazy right now.

7586
07:33:23,740 --> 07:33:26,740
Every batch of trout is making me go up another level.

7587
07:33:26,740 --> 07:33:28,740
I'm already 31 cooking.

7588
07:33:30,740 --> 07:33:34,740
We're messing around, having fun on quests.

7589
07:33:34,740 --> 07:33:36,740
And now I'm just doing...

7590
07:33:36,740 --> 07:33:38,740
I'm actually tempted to go to the Grand Exchange to...

7591
07:33:38,740 --> 07:33:40,740
Oh, sorry, I'm pressing the wrong button.

7592
07:33:40,740 --> 07:33:43,740
I'm tempted to go to the Grand Exchange

7593
07:33:43,740 --> 07:33:46,740
to drop the fish and rod off,

7594
07:33:46,740 --> 07:33:49,740
just to do full inventories as well.

7595
07:33:49,740 --> 07:33:50,740
I think I may.

7596
07:33:50,740 --> 07:33:52,740
I'm going to be right back, reflames, okay?

7597
07:33:52,740 --> 07:33:56,740
I'm going to drop the feathers and the fish and rod away,

7598
07:33:56,740 --> 07:33:57,740
that you guys can stay.

7599
07:33:57,740 --> 07:33:59,740
Don't worry, don't get separation anxiety.

7600
07:33:59,740 --> 07:34:00,740
I'll be right back.

7601
07:34:00,740 --> 07:34:03,740
Mummy's going to the Grand Exchange and back again.

7602
07:34:03,740 --> 07:34:04,740
You'll be okay.

7603
07:34:04,740 --> 07:34:06,740
It's fine.

7604
07:34:06,740 --> 07:34:08,740
Mummy will be right back.

7605
07:34:08,740 --> 07:34:09,740
See, I'm across the water.

7606
07:34:09,740 --> 07:34:10,740
Bye-bye.

7607
07:34:10,740 --> 07:34:11,740
I'll be right back.

7608
07:34:13,740 --> 07:34:14,740
Literally.

7609
07:34:14,740 --> 07:34:16,740
All right, I just need to drop this off

7610
07:34:16,740 --> 07:34:18,740
so I can have full...

7611
07:34:18,740 --> 07:34:19,740
No, not the book.

7612
07:34:19,740 --> 07:34:20,740
Not the booth.

7613
07:34:20,740 --> 07:34:21,740
I want the bank.

7614
07:34:21,740 --> 07:34:23,740
I'm trying to see if I can do it through the ceiling.

7615
07:34:23,740 --> 07:34:24,740
I can't.

7616
07:34:26,740 --> 07:34:27,740
She's never coming back.

7617
07:34:27,740 --> 07:34:28,740
I'm coming back.

7618
07:34:28,740 --> 07:34:30,740
I just need to bank the banker.

7619
07:34:32,740 --> 07:34:33,740
There, there, there.

7620
07:34:33,740 --> 07:34:34,740
See, look, empty.

7621
07:34:34,740 --> 07:34:35,740
Look, I'm already running back.

7622
07:34:35,740 --> 07:34:36,740
I'm running out of stamina.

7623
07:34:36,740 --> 07:34:37,740
It's okay.

7624
07:34:37,740 --> 07:34:38,740
I'm a wee bit tired.

7625
07:34:38,740 --> 07:34:39,740
I'm getting a wee bit tired.

7626
07:34:39,740 --> 07:34:40,740
45.

7627
07:34:40,740 --> 07:34:41,740
Stamina.

7628
07:34:42,740 --> 07:34:43,740
Wah, wah, wah.

7629
07:34:44,740 --> 07:34:45,740
I'm coming back.

7630
07:34:45,740 --> 07:34:46,740
I'm coming back.

7631
07:34:47,740 --> 07:34:48,740
We're orphans!

7632
07:34:48,740 --> 07:34:49,740
No!

7633
07:34:51,740 --> 07:34:52,740
You can't be, you can't be, you can't be.

7634
07:34:52,740 --> 07:34:53,740
See, look, look, look, I'm back.

7635
07:34:53,740 --> 07:34:54,740
Look, who's that?

7636
07:34:54,740 --> 07:34:55,740
Who's that?

7637
07:34:55,740 --> 07:34:56,740
That's right.

7638
07:34:56,740 --> 07:34:57,740
I'm on the other side of the water.

7639
07:34:57,740 --> 07:34:58,740
Boom.

7640
07:34:58,740 --> 07:34:59,740
I'm coming to pick up that trout

7641
07:34:59,740 --> 07:35:00,740
that's on the floor there

7642
07:35:00,740 --> 07:35:01,740
because there's tons.

7643
07:35:01,740 --> 07:35:03,740
Oh, the renaissance of the fire as well.

7644
07:35:05,740 --> 07:35:07,740
See, we have no home.

7645
07:35:07,740 --> 07:35:09,740
See, look, I'm literally right here.

7646
07:35:10,740 --> 07:35:12,740
Is there so dramatic?

7647
07:35:12,740 --> 07:35:14,740
See, of all the trout.

7648
07:35:15,740 --> 07:35:18,740
I'm max leveling up.

7649
07:35:18,740 --> 07:35:21,740
I'm going to pick up all the ones on the floor.

7650
07:35:21,740 --> 07:35:23,740
It's better to drop the trout.

7651
07:35:23,740 --> 07:35:25,740
It's faster to drop it.

7652
07:35:26,740 --> 07:35:29,740
Who dares the spots picking up?

7653
07:35:29,740 --> 07:35:30,740
It's faster to drop the trout

7654
07:35:30,740 --> 07:35:32,740
than it is to trade me.

7655
07:35:32,740 --> 07:35:34,740
Right, okay, full inventory.

7656
07:35:36,740 --> 07:35:39,740
We're going to be in the 50s after this.

7657
07:35:39,740 --> 07:35:41,740
There's no way we're not.

7658
07:35:42,740 --> 07:35:45,740
What were you doing with all those people

7659
07:35:45,740 --> 07:35:47,740
in the business room?

7660
07:35:47,740 --> 07:35:49,740
Dropping trout.

7661
07:35:49,740 --> 07:35:51,740
Trout.

7662
07:35:51,740 --> 07:35:53,740
Oh, pardon me.

7663
07:35:53,740 --> 07:35:55,740
Trout.

7664
07:35:55,740 --> 07:35:56,740
Trout.

7665
07:35:56,740 --> 07:35:58,740
The fish.

7666
07:35:58,740 --> 07:35:59,740
Trout.

7667
07:35:59,740 --> 07:36:00,740
Trout.

7668
07:36:00,740 --> 07:36:02,740
You don't need to see the sea

7669
07:36:02,740 --> 07:36:03,740
at the end.

7670
07:36:03,740 --> 07:36:04,740
Dropping trout.

7671
07:36:05,740 --> 07:36:07,740
There's loads of words that I say like that.

7672
07:36:07,740 --> 07:36:09,740
I can't believe it.

7673
07:36:10,740 --> 07:36:13,740
Check your XP per hour on the bar.

7674
07:36:17,740 --> 07:36:19,740
Why is it not displaying?

7675
07:36:20,740 --> 07:36:21,740
This is I'm cooking.

7676
07:36:21,740 --> 07:36:24,740
Cooked 92, 93 per hour burn.

7677
07:36:24,740 --> 07:36:26,740
23% burn rate.

7678
07:36:26,740 --> 07:36:28,740
Why is it not displaying?

7679
07:36:28,740 --> 07:36:30,740
I'm cooking though.

7680
07:36:31,740 --> 07:36:33,740
It's not like telling me.

7681
07:36:33,740 --> 07:36:34,740
Literally level 20.

7682
07:36:34,740 --> 07:36:36,740
It's not like telling me.

7683
07:36:39,740 --> 07:36:40,740
Hmm.

7684
07:36:43,740 --> 07:36:44,740
Trout.

7685
07:36:44,740 --> 07:36:46,740
It's short for trousers.

7686
07:36:49,740 --> 07:36:50,740
Oh, this one.

7687
07:36:50,740 --> 07:36:52,740
Oh, now we're talking.

7688
07:36:52,740 --> 07:36:53,740
Hold on.

7689
07:36:53,740 --> 07:36:55,740
Let me drop all these.

7690
07:36:56,740 --> 07:36:59,740
It says for not fishing.

7691
07:36:59,740 --> 07:37:00,740
Cooking.

7692
07:37:00,740 --> 07:37:01,740
Where is cooking?

7693
07:37:01,740 --> 07:37:03,740
Where's cooking?

7694
07:37:04,740 --> 07:37:05,740
Here.

7695
07:37:05,740 --> 07:37:06,740
Cooking's purple.

7696
07:37:06,740 --> 07:37:08,740
Why would it be purple honestly?

7697
07:37:09,740 --> 07:37:10,740
Let me grab all these trout.

7698
07:37:10,740 --> 07:37:12,740
There's like so much on the floor honestly.

7699
07:37:14,740 --> 07:37:15,740
I can't keep up.

7700
07:37:15,740 --> 07:37:16,740
There's so much.

7701
07:37:19,740 --> 07:37:24,740
It says I'm gaining 2,000 XP per hour.

7702
07:37:26,740 --> 07:37:27,740
Oh, there's trout here.

7703
07:37:27,740 --> 07:37:28,740
Trout, trout, trout.

7704
07:37:29,740 --> 07:37:30,740
No, the trout.

7705
07:37:30,740 --> 07:37:31,740
Not the fire.

7706
07:37:32,740 --> 07:37:34,740
Now I've got to fill inventory.

7707
07:37:36,740 --> 07:37:37,740
Let's see.

7708
07:37:38,740 --> 07:37:41,740
XP gained 16 hour, roughly 2k,

7709
07:37:41,740 --> 07:37:43,740
but it's probably going to go up for a bit

7710
07:37:43,740 --> 07:37:46,740
because I'm not being done fill trout and XP left.

7711
07:37:47,740 --> 07:37:50,740
Oh no, it's getting covered up by the freaking layer.

7712
07:37:55,740 --> 07:37:56,740
I'm coming back in.

7713
07:37:56,740 --> 07:37:58,740
We're at Barbarian Village

7714
07:37:58,740 --> 07:38:00,740
at the free play fishing spot.

7715
07:38:02,740 --> 07:38:04,740
But I think we're definitely higher.

7716
07:38:04,740 --> 07:38:06,740
Yeah, this is going up.

7717
07:38:06,740 --> 07:38:08,740
It says we're now 2.3 per hour.

7718
07:38:08,740 --> 07:38:10,740
It's because we've not done it for an hour, but...

7719
07:38:11,740 --> 07:38:12,740
Once we have...

7720
07:38:12,740 --> 07:38:13,740
It says...

7721
07:38:13,740 --> 07:38:15,740
Actually, I don't know if you can see that.

7722
07:38:16,740 --> 07:38:17,740
Of course not.

7723
07:38:17,740 --> 07:38:20,740
It literally says like six actions left

7724
07:38:20,740 --> 07:38:23,740
and then we've leveled up, so that's really good.

7725
07:38:23,740 --> 07:38:24,740
I like that.

7726
07:38:24,740 --> 07:38:26,740
It kind of puts into perspective

7727
07:38:26,740 --> 07:38:28,740
how much you need to do in order to get next.

7728
07:38:28,740 --> 07:38:29,740
Next.

7729
07:38:33,740 --> 07:38:35,740
You can write...

7730
07:38:35,740 --> 07:38:37,740
Literally level 33.

7731
07:38:38,740 --> 07:38:40,740
You can reset.

7732
07:38:41,740 --> 07:38:42,740
I'll just leave that.

7733
07:38:44,740 --> 07:38:45,740
That's the only burnt two.

7734
07:38:45,740 --> 07:38:47,740
Oh, burnt three that time.

7735
07:38:51,740 --> 07:38:53,740
They don't burn three that time.

7736
07:38:54,740 --> 07:38:56,740
I'm so MLG pro.

7737
07:38:59,740 --> 07:39:02,740
Oh, I shouldn't maybe drop the trout here.

7738
07:39:06,740 --> 07:39:08,740
I don't know when I can start cooking salmon,

7739
07:39:08,740 --> 07:39:10,740
but it should be sent to you.

7740
07:39:15,740 --> 07:39:17,740
She needs that raw fish meat.

7741
07:39:17,740 --> 07:39:19,740
Are you treating me fish?

7742
07:39:21,740 --> 07:39:23,740
Oh no, I don't have inventory for that.

7743
07:39:23,740 --> 07:39:24,740
Is that tuna?

7744
07:39:24,740 --> 07:39:26,740
I'm pretty sure that's tuna.

7745
07:39:26,740 --> 07:39:27,740
Sorry, I don't have any...

7746
07:39:27,740 --> 07:39:29,740
Oh, you're giving me three tuna?

7747
07:39:29,740 --> 07:39:33,740
I don't even think I'm like leveling enough to do that.

7748
07:39:33,740 --> 07:39:34,740
What are you?

7749
07:39:34,740 --> 07:39:36,740
Use tuna on the fire.

7750
07:39:36,740 --> 07:39:37,740
Oh, I can.

7751
07:39:37,740 --> 07:39:38,740
Oh, it's not tuna.

7752
07:39:38,740 --> 07:39:39,740
Oh, what is it?

7753
07:39:39,740 --> 07:39:40,740
It's tuna.

7754
07:39:41,740 --> 07:39:42,740
Oh, burnt it.

7755
07:39:43,740 --> 07:39:45,740
It's 100 XP.

7756
07:39:45,740 --> 07:39:47,740
Wait, that's more XP than salmon.

7757
07:39:51,740 --> 07:39:52,740
Okay.

7758
07:39:53,740 --> 07:39:54,740
Reset.

7759
07:39:54,740 --> 07:39:55,740
It seems to have bugged out.

7760
07:39:55,740 --> 07:39:56,740
Okay, I'll reset.

7761
07:39:56,740 --> 07:39:58,740
Sorry, reset.

7762
07:40:00,740 --> 07:40:01,740
Oh, I know it's not the bomb.

7763
07:40:01,740 --> 07:40:03,740
Oh, you can actually see it though, no?

7764
07:40:04,740 --> 07:40:06,740
Tuna max and right now,

7765
07:40:06,740 --> 07:40:07,740
Manstronia just really...

7766
07:40:07,740 --> 07:40:11,740
That you and my definition of fun are completely different.

7767
07:40:11,740 --> 07:40:14,740
I mean, I'm literally becoming a little chef.

7768
07:40:14,740 --> 07:40:17,740
I'm able to feed all the reeflings like this now.

7769
07:40:20,740 --> 07:40:22,740
Oh, she'll be getting all the thingies.

7770
07:40:22,740 --> 07:40:24,740
Oh, it says I have nine actions left.

7771
07:40:24,740 --> 07:40:25,740
That's so cool.

7772
07:40:25,740 --> 07:40:28,740
That says like you literally have a number.

7773
07:40:28,740 --> 07:40:30,740
Because soon it will be like 100 left

7774
07:40:30,740 --> 07:40:31,740
and then it'll be 1000 left

7775
07:40:31,740 --> 07:40:33,740
and I'll be like, that's fine.

7776
07:40:34,740 --> 07:40:36,740
Her numbers are going way up.

7777
07:40:36,740 --> 07:40:38,740
Literally, this is like...

7778
07:40:38,740 --> 07:40:42,740
If you like slow incremental games that feel satisfying,

7779
07:40:42,740 --> 07:40:45,740
RuneScape is definitely for you.

7780
07:40:45,740 --> 07:40:48,740
I've never 99 something

7781
07:40:48,740 --> 07:40:50,740
and I want to do it

7782
07:40:50,740 --> 07:40:53,740
and you guys can hold me accountable for it.

7783
07:40:53,740 --> 07:40:55,740
I'll literally tuna max and so whatever.

7784
07:40:55,740 --> 07:40:56,740
Who's got trout up for me?

7785
07:40:56,740 --> 07:40:57,740
No, that's cooked trout.

7786
07:40:57,740 --> 07:40:59,740
That's raw trout, okay.

7787
07:40:59,740 --> 07:41:01,740
Oh wait, is this accept trade?

7788
07:41:01,740 --> 07:41:02,740
Do you got more tuna?

7789
07:41:02,740 --> 07:41:04,740
It's the tuna man.

7790
07:41:05,740 --> 07:41:06,740
Of course, it's fun.

7791
07:41:06,740 --> 07:41:07,740
Numbers goes up.

7792
07:41:07,740 --> 07:41:09,740
Don't for me and we all get literally...

7793
07:41:10,740 --> 07:41:13,740
Wow, thank you so much for the tuna.

7794
07:41:13,740 --> 07:41:15,740
How is everyone today?

7795
07:41:15,740 --> 07:41:16,740
Someone asks.

7796
07:41:17,740 --> 07:41:19,740
We're...

7797
07:41:19,740 --> 07:41:21,740
We're tuna max...

7798
07:41:21,740 --> 07:41:22,740
No, not tuna.

7799
07:41:22,740 --> 07:41:24,740
Oh, I was talking.

7800
07:41:24,740 --> 07:41:25,740
I was taking...

7801
07:41:25,740 --> 07:41:26,740
Are you squiddin' me right now?

7802
07:41:26,740 --> 07:41:27,740
Brian!

7803
07:41:27,740 --> 07:41:29,740
We love when numbers go up,

7804
07:41:29,740 --> 07:41:31,740
so have some numbers.

7805
07:41:31,740 --> 07:41:34,740
Oh, money's different.

7806
07:41:34,740 --> 07:41:37,740
Thank you for the tip, don't do that.

7807
07:41:37,740 --> 07:41:39,740
We do love money going up

7808
07:41:39,740 --> 07:41:41,740
in incremental video games.

7809
07:41:43,740 --> 07:41:46,740
We're playing Cooking Sim

7810
07:41:46,740 --> 07:41:48,740
and it's amazing.

7811
07:41:48,740 --> 07:41:50,740
Hope...

7812
07:41:50,740 --> 07:41:52,740
Hope your day is going well.

7813
07:41:52,740 --> 07:41:54,740
Smile if you see.

7814
07:41:54,740 --> 07:41:56,740
Always be nice to people.

7815
07:41:57,740 --> 07:42:00,740
I am burning the absolute living

7816
07:42:00,740 --> 07:42:01,740
daylights out of this tuna.

7817
07:42:01,740 --> 07:42:02,740
I'm so sorry.

7818
07:42:02,740 --> 07:42:04,740
I've just wasted all that tuna.

7819
07:42:06,740 --> 07:42:07,740
So sorry.

7820
07:42:09,740 --> 07:42:11,740
I have been here for like four hours.

7821
07:42:13,740 --> 07:42:15,740
Oh, I keep messing it up.

7822
07:42:15,740 --> 07:42:16,740
I wonder if you could sell cooked tuna

7823
07:42:16,740 --> 07:42:17,740
for decent money.

7824
07:42:17,740 --> 07:42:19,740
I don't think it's a cheap fish.

7825
07:42:19,740 --> 07:42:21,740
I seem to think like...

7826
07:42:21,740 --> 07:42:23,740
Alright, raw trout time.

7827
07:42:26,740 --> 07:42:28,740
Uh, fishing levels?

7828
07:42:28,740 --> 07:42:30,740
Uh, um...

7829
07:42:30,740 --> 07:42:32,740
Anya?

7830
07:42:32,740 --> 07:42:33,740
What the fuck?

7831
07:42:33,740 --> 07:42:34,740
Runescape message saying

7832
07:42:34,740 --> 07:42:35,740
I'm going to be logged in

7833
07:42:35,740 --> 07:42:36,740
in 30 minutes, max six hours play.

7834
07:42:36,740 --> 07:42:38,740
Wait, is that real?

7835
07:42:38,740 --> 07:42:40,740
Wait, you got more tuna already?

7836
07:42:40,740 --> 07:42:42,740
Wait, you can't have.

7837
07:42:43,740 --> 07:42:45,740
How are you doing?

7838
07:42:47,740 --> 07:42:48,740
Are you peddling tuna to me

7839
07:42:48,740 --> 07:42:50,740
to level me up faster?

7840
07:42:50,740 --> 07:42:51,740
I feel like I'm wasting all your

7841
07:42:51,740 --> 07:42:52,740
tuna.

7842
07:42:54,740 --> 07:42:55,740
Oh, no.

7843
07:42:57,740 --> 07:42:59,740
Wait, are we finally doing it?

7844
07:42:59,740 --> 07:43:00,740
Are we...

7845
07:43:00,740 --> 07:43:02,740
Are we got tuna slave runners?

7846
07:43:04,740 --> 07:43:06,740
Yeah, it's like there was log is real.

7847
07:43:06,740 --> 07:43:07,740
Wait, am I going to be booted out

7848
07:43:07,740 --> 07:43:09,740
or because I bought membership

7849
07:43:09,740 --> 07:43:11,740
I'm not going to be booted out.

7850
07:43:11,740 --> 07:43:13,740
I have plenty of tuna.

7851
07:43:13,740 --> 07:43:15,740
I could literally buy a million.

7852
07:43:17,740 --> 07:43:18,740
Hey, Strony.

7853
07:43:18,740 --> 07:43:20,740
Am I in trouble for cooking

7854
07:43:20,740 --> 07:43:21,740
my own food tonight?

7855
07:43:21,740 --> 07:43:22,740
Does that mean I could just jump

7856
07:43:22,740 --> 07:43:23,740
into the kitchen?

7857
07:43:23,740 --> 07:43:25,740
You're allowed to make it.

7858
07:43:27,740 --> 07:43:28,740
He...

7859
07:43:28,740 --> 07:43:29,740
That is messed up.

7860
07:43:29,740 --> 07:43:30,740
I'm not a child.

7861
07:43:30,740 --> 07:43:31,740
Literally why is the game

7862
07:43:31,740 --> 07:43:33,740
doing it for like bandwidth issues?

7863
07:43:33,740 --> 07:43:35,740
If you're a free member,

7864
07:43:35,740 --> 07:43:37,740
they're like, oh, we've had enough of you.

7865
07:43:37,740 --> 07:43:39,740
Strony becomes a master chef

7866
07:43:39,740 --> 07:43:40,740
but can't fight a rat.

7867
07:43:40,740 --> 07:43:42,740
No, it was the cow that was going to

7868
07:43:42,740 --> 07:43:43,740
kill me.

7869
07:43:43,740 --> 07:43:44,740
It was a baby cow.

7870
07:43:46,740 --> 07:43:48,740
And you just log in right back after.

7871
07:43:50,740 --> 07:43:51,740
That's bizarre.

7872
07:43:51,740 --> 07:43:52,740
No, my...

7873
07:43:52,740 --> 07:43:53,740
What?

7874
07:43:54,740 --> 07:43:56,740
Well, it says we've been up for seven

7875
07:43:56,740 --> 07:43:58,740
hours or is it because I got logged out

7876
07:43:58,740 --> 07:44:00,740
when I went away for like a cup of tea

7877
07:44:00,740 --> 07:44:01,740
and that?

7878
07:44:01,740 --> 07:44:02,740
I wonder if that's why.

7879
07:44:03,740 --> 07:44:04,740
Hold on.

7880
07:44:05,740 --> 07:44:06,740
Is tuna max...

7881
07:44:06,740 --> 07:44:08,740
Is tuna max through there?

7882
07:44:10,740 --> 07:44:11,740
I've got Buddha at one point.

7883
07:44:11,740 --> 07:44:13,740
Yeah, you've just been DCing a lot.

7884
07:44:13,740 --> 07:44:15,740
Okay, every time I go for Tinkle Winkle,

7885
07:44:15,740 --> 07:44:17,740
I've been DCed so it doesn't count.

7886
07:44:18,740 --> 07:44:19,740
How much do you care about doing

7887
07:44:19,740 --> 07:44:20,740
the proper way?

7888
07:44:20,740 --> 07:44:23,740
I think I'm supposed to do wine next.

7889
07:44:23,740 --> 07:44:24,740
Someone says, hi, Emmy.

7890
07:44:24,740 --> 07:44:26,740
Is the Emmy imposter here?

7891
07:44:27,740 --> 07:44:29,740
Where's the Emmy imposter?

7892
07:44:33,740 --> 07:44:34,740
Oh, there it is.

7893
07:44:34,740 --> 07:44:38,740
You changed your name to Emmy Bizoon Game.

7894
07:44:38,740 --> 07:44:39,740
Level 113.

7895
07:44:39,740 --> 07:44:41,740
That's a big account, honestly.

7896
07:44:42,740 --> 07:44:44,740
Okay, let me grab this.

7897
07:44:47,740 --> 07:44:48,740
Emmy's...

7898
07:44:48,740 --> 07:44:50,740
Emmy's a RuneScape nerd.

7899
07:44:52,740 --> 07:44:54,740
No, it's not the real Emmers,

7900
07:44:54,740 --> 07:44:55,740
but someone likes her,

7901
07:44:55,740 --> 07:44:58,740
so I'm glad someone enjoys her as much to do that.

7902
07:44:59,740 --> 07:45:01,740
Emmy the Goal, honestly.

7903
07:45:01,740 --> 07:45:02,740
What's the fit on Emmy?

7904
07:45:02,740 --> 07:45:04,740
Oh, they changed her hair to look like

7905
07:45:04,740 --> 07:45:06,740
her pumpkins and everything.

7906
07:45:06,740 --> 07:45:08,740
And give her a skirt.

7907
07:45:08,740 --> 07:45:10,740
That's supposed to be her blue shorts.

7908
07:45:10,740 --> 07:45:12,740
Okay, okay, okay.

7909
07:45:13,740 --> 07:45:15,740
Let him get up, let him get up.

7910
07:45:15,740 --> 07:45:16,740
Where is that?

7911
07:45:17,740 --> 07:45:19,740
We're already level 35.

7912
07:45:20,740 --> 07:45:22,740
We should've came here, like, from the beginning.

7913
07:45:22,740 --> 07:45:25,740
We wouldn't even have had to do anything.

7914
07:45:27,740 --> 07:45:30,740
Yeah, and that baby cow has been caught in front of a king.

7915
07:45:32,740 --> 07:45:34,740
Hydration check.

7916
07:45:34,740 --> 07:45:36,740
I'm actually running out of water.

7917
07:45:39,740 --> 07:45:41,740
What's mercy, one hour?

7918
07:45:46,740 --> 07:45:47,740
Wah.

7919
07:45:48,740 --> 07:45:50,740
It gives me, like, relief drink and water

7920
07:45:50,740 --> 07:45:51,740
for a millisecond,

7921
07:45:51,740 --> 07:45:54,740
and then I feel the pain of talking again.

7922
07:45:55,740 --> 07:45:57,740
Let's do this raw trip.

7923
07:45:58,740 --> 07:45:59,740
Raw trip.

7924
07:46:00,740 --> 07:46:01,740
Oh, sorry.

7925
07:46:01,740 --> 07:46:03,740
I keep forgetting Mr. Tuna Man.

7926
07:46:03,740 --> 07:46:04,740
Sorry, guys.

7927
07:46:05,740 --> 07:46:07,740
I got, like, three space.

7928
07:46:10,740 --> 07:46:12,740
That tuna man going ham.

7929
07:46:12,740 --> 07:46:14,740
Oh my God, that's so much money.

7930
07:46:15,740 --> 07:46:17,740
Absolutely nothing.

7931
07:46:17,740 --> 07:46:19,740
And then the value on your side

7932
07:46:19,740 --> 07:46:21,740
is just, like, losing horrifically.

7933
07:46:25,740 --> 07:46:27,740
I can do one more inventory,

7934
07:46:27,740 --> 07:46:29,740
and then I have to do some rune crafting

7935
07:46:29,740 --> 07:46:30,740
for my clan skull.

7936
07:46:30,740 --> 07:46:31,740
Okay, thank you so much.

7937
07:46:31,740 --> 07:46:32,740
Excuse me, ma'am.

7938
07:46:32,740 --> 07:46:35,740
We had to level up to 20 fishing to start fishing here.

7939
07:46:35,740 --> 07:46:40,740
Yes, you have to go back to the Castello.

7940
07:46:40,740 --> 07:46:41,740
Good luck.

7941
07:46:41,740 --> 07:46:42,740
Thank you so much for the...

7942
07:46:42,740 --> 07:46:44,740
Thanks for all the fish.

7943
07:46:44,740 --> 07:46:47,740
I'm pretty sure that is the ending to a movie

7944
07:46:47,740 --> 07:46:50,740
that Bilbo was in that I haven't watched yet.

7945
07:46:52,740 --> 07:46:53,740
I can't remember.

7946
07:46:53,740 --> 07:46:55,740
But it goes thanks for all the fish.

7947
07:46:55,740 --> 07:46:57,740
Level 36.

7948
07:46:58,740 --> 07:46:59,740
Oh my God.

7949
07:46:59,740 --> 07:47:02,740
The tuna, literally a hundred of pop as well, is crazy.

7950
07:47:04,740 --> 07:47:06,740
He keeps in the bunny soup girl

7951
07:47:06,740 --> 07:47:07,740
turning into a guy.

7952
07:47:07,740 --> 07:47:08,740
Oh, never mind.

7953
07:47:10,740 --> 07:47:12,740
It's because they're dancing on each other.

7954
07:47:12,740 --> 07:47:13,740
Hitchhiker's guide.

7955
07:47:13,740 --> 07:47:15,740
Yes, I've not seen that.

7956
07:47:16,740 --> 07:47:17,740
Good Lord, you're still alive?

7957
07:47:17,740 --> 07:47:19,740
Yeah, we're tuna maxing.

7958
07:47:19,740 --> 07:47:21,740
We're currently level 36.

7959
07:47:22,740 --> 07:47:24,740
And cooking is that purple one right there.

7960
07:47:25,740 --> 07:47:26,740
Here.

7961
07:47:26,740 --> 07:47:28,740
We're level 36.

7962
07:47:28,740 --> 07:47:30,740
Apparently your egg steeper hour is like

7963
07:47:30,740 --> 07:47:32,740
freaking 56K with the tuna.

7964
07:47:32,740 --> 07:47:34,740
It's like going up like crazy.

7965
07:47:41,740 --> 07:47:42,740
So much tuna.

7966
07:47:44,740 --> 07:47:45,740
You know what's really nice?

7967
07:47:45,740 --> 07:47:46,740
Tuna, cucumber, meal.

7968
07:47:48,740 --> 07:47:50,740
Like uncrusted bread.

7969
07:47:50,740 --> 07:47:51,740
Oh, no, no, no.

7970
07:47:51,740 --> 07:47:52,740
It's delicious.

7971
07:47:59,740 --> 07:48:01,740
Can we cook raw salmon yet?

7972
07:48:01,740 --> 07:48:02,740
Let me check.

7973
07:48:02,740 --> 07:48:04,740
Use the salmon on the fire.

7974
07:48:05,740 --> 07:48:07,740
What's everyone's opinion on anchovy pizza?

7975
07:48:07,740 --> 07:48:08,740
Oh, I can cook salmon.

7976
07:48:08,740 --> 07:48:09,740
Okay.

7977
07:48:09,740 --> 07:48:11,740
I can pick up salmon now as well.

7978
07:48:11,740 --> 07:48:12,740
Right.

7979
07:48:12,740 --> 07:48:14,740
I'll pick up salmon and trout so I can just like do it all.

7980
07:48:15,740 --> 07:48:18,740
Level 50 is about 100K egg fee total.

7981
07:48:20,740 --> 07:48:22,740
What's my total egg fee?

7982
07:48:24,740 --> 07:48:26,740
I am one fourth of the way to level 50.

7983
07:48:26,740 --> 07:48:29,740
I'm not sure I can do it before Maryse goes online.

7984
07:48:30,740 --> 07:48:32,740
Oh, I'll be cutting it close, I think.

7985
07:48:33,740 --> 07:48:34,740
Oh, no, I can't.

7986
07:48:34,740 --> 07:48:35,740
I would have to be tuna maxing.

7987
07:48:35,740 --> 07:48:38,740
Unless the salmon does it, I'm not sure.

7988
07:48:39,740 --> 07:48:41,740
Unless the salmon does it.

7989
07:48:43,740 --> 07:48:46,740
And if I stop burning everything.

7990
07:48:48,740 --> 07:48:50,740
I'm scooping up all this trout.

7991
07:48:50,740 --> 07:48:52,740
I'm scooping it up.

7992
07:48:52,740 --> 07:48:54,740
My inventory is getting so full.

7993
07:48:56,740 --> 07:48:58,740
Someone's got a mini cliff.

7994
07:48:59,740 --> 07:49:01,740
No, but that is huge.

7995
07:49:03,740 --> 07:49:06,740
It's so fast with the salmon as well.

7996
07:49:08,740 --> 07:49:11,740
Oh, five more salmon and then level up again.

7997
07:49:13,740 --> 07:49:15,740
Oh, come on, you can do it.

7998
07:49:15,740 --> 07:49:16,740
Two more.

7999
07:49:16,740 --> 07:49:17,740
One more.

8000
07:49:18,740 --> 07:49:19,740
Yes!

8001
07:49:20,740 --> 07:49:21,740
30 freaking six.

8002
07:49:22,740 --> 07:49:23,740
37, sorry.

8003
07:49:23,740 --> 07:49:24,740
I know numbers sometimes.

8004
07:49:25,740 --> 07:49:28,740
Oh, we are tuna maxing.

8005
07:49:28,740 --> 07:49:31,740
We are fish maxing out the wazoo right now.

8006
07:49:33,740 --> 07:49:34,740
Stronny.

8007
07:49:34,740 --> 07:49:35,740
You can do it, Stronny.

8008
07:49:35,740 --> 07:49:37,740
Cook this, Galea's base starts late.

8009
07:49:37,740 --> 07:49:39,740
There's neither motor.

8010
07:49:40,740 --> 07:49:41,740
There's neither motor.

8011
07:49:41,740 --> 07:49:42,740
There's neither motor.

8012
07:49:42,740 --> 07:49:44,740
There's neither motor.

8013
07:49:45,740 --> 07:49:48,740
We're going to do it, we're going to do it.

8014
07:49:50,740 --> 07:49:53,740
Tuna is more XP than salmon.

8015
07:49:53,740 --> 07:49:55,740
Salmon's more XP than trout.

8016
07:49:56,740 --> 07:49:59,740
But unfortunately I'm still at the burning stage,

8017
07:49:59,740 --> 07:50:02,740
so I'm not maximising my inventory right now.

8018
07:50:04,740 --> 07:50:07,740
I don't think there's any other quests that give cooking XP

8019
07:50:07,740 --> 07:50:09,740
that I know of other than...

8020
07:50:09,740 --> 07:50:11,740
There's probably a ton of members' quests

8021
07:50:11,740 --> 07:50:14,740
that do have, like, cooking XP.

8022
07:50:16,740 --> 07:50:19,740
But as it stands right now,

8023
07:50:20,740 --> 07:50:22,740
we'll do full inventory of raw trout.

8024
07:50:24,740 --> 07:50:27,740
But once we start, once we stop burning,

8025
07:50:27,740 --> 07:50:31,740
then we can do, like, max inventory XP gains,

8026
07:50:31,740 --> 07:50:34,740
which is really handy down there.

8027
07:50:35,740 --> 07:50:36,740
Who took that little bit sound?

8028
07:50:36,740 --> 07:50:38,740
Who taking my trout?

8029
07:50:38,740 --> 07:50:39,740
You need my trout.

8030
07:50:41,740 --> 07:50:43,740
Salmon might honestly be better rates

8031
07:50:43,740 --> 07:50:45,740
when you factor in the burn rate.

8032
07:50:45,740 --> 07:50:46,740
Mmm.

8033
07:50:46,740 --> 07:50:48,740
It's possible.

8034
07:50:48,740 --> 07:50:51,740
Someone else here is, like, snatching up the salmon,

8035
07:50:51,740 --> 07:50:52,740
which is fine.

8036
07:50:52,740 --> 07:50:54,740
Honestly, it's not like the trout is, like,

8037
07:50:54,740 --> 07:50:56,740
bad or anything.

8038
07:50:57,740 --> 07:50:59,740
I know we'll make it to 40.

8039
07:50:59,740 --> 07:51:01,740
The question is how far in?

8040
07:51:03,740 --> 07:51:05,740
True mummy gamey here, honestly.

8041
07:51:05,740 --> 07:51:07,740
Click simulator.

8042
07:51:07,740 --> 07:51:09,740
But it's so good though!

8043
07:51:09,740 --> 07:51:11,740
Oh, like, RuneScape is so nostalgic.

8044
07:51:19,740 --> 07:51:22,740
Look, it's like, I love how the Rune plug-in,

8045
07:51:22,740 --> 07:51:24,740
or whatever it's called, RuneLight,

8046
07:51:24,740 --> 07:51:26,740
literally absolutely annihilating out here.

8047
07:51:27,740 --> 07:51:32,740
Salmon's success rate at 38 is 74%.

8048
07:51:32,740 --> 07:51:35,740
Mmm, that's not bad.

8049
07:51:35,740 --> 07:51:37,740
Everyone in four?

8050
07:51:40,740 --> 07:51:41,740
Everyone in four.

8051
07:51:41,740 --> 07:51:43,740
Okay, who has the XL spreadsheet?

8052
07:51:43,740 --> 07:51:45,740
An optimal fish cookin'.

8053
07:51:46,740 --> 07:51:49,740
The best member's quest for it is the family crest,

8054
07:51:49,740 --> 07:51:51,740
so you get gloves that would just burn it.

8055
07:51:51,740 --> 07:51:54,740
Oh, I've never done, I don't know what that is actually.

8056
07:51:56,740 --> 07:51:58,740
It sounds difficult though,

8057
07:51:58,740 --> 07:52:01,740
because for something to be such a good item,

8058
07:52:01,740 --> 07:52:03,740
I feel like they would have put it behind,

8059
07:52:03,740 --> 07:52:05,740
like, really difficult quests.

8060
07:52:06,740 --> 07:52:08,740
Oh, if I can pick up a few of these salmon,

8061
07:52:08,740 --> 07:52:09,740
I'll make the photos.

8062
07:52:12,740 --> 07:52:14,740
RuneLight is insane.

8063
07:52:14,740 --> 07:52:16,740
I can never play with a vanilla client again.

8064
07:52:18,740 --> 07:52:19,740
Get mugged.

8065
07:52:21,740 --> 07:52:23,740
I suppose if you want, like, super nostalgic,

8066
07:52:23,740 --> 07:52:24,740
just leave it as is.

8067
07:52:24,740 --> 07:52:26,740
Right, we'll do the trout first,

8068
07:52:26,740 --> 07:52:28,740
because I want, like, I don't want to

8069
07:52:28,740 --> 07:52:30,740
have higher rate of burning the salmon,

8070
07:52:30,740 --> 07:52:32,740
since it offers more.

8071
07:52:33,740 --> 07:52:35,740
Do you just stream forever, strong?

8072
07:52:35,740 --> 07:52:37,740
I just really enjoy streaming,

8073
07:52:37,740 --> 07:52:39,740
and I like hanging out with refunds,

8074
07:52:39,740 --> 07:52:41,740
especially on days where we get to play a multiplayer game,

8075
07:52:41,740 --> 07:52:43,740
where we get to be together.

8076
07:52:43,740 --> 07:52:45,740
I really like that.

8077
07:52:46,740 --> 07:52:49,740
I'm actually going off a bit earlier than expected.

8078
07:52:49,740 --> 07:52:51,740
When Mercy comes online in an hour,

8079
07:52:51,740 --> 07:52:53,740
I'm raiding into her.

8080
07:52:53,740 --> 07:52:56,740
And the only reason I'm not doing an endurance today,

8081
07:52:56,740 --> 07:53:00,740
hmm, is because my voice is very sore,

8082
07:53:00,740 --> 07:53:02,740
and I have an ASMR stream tomorrow,

8083
07:53:02,740 --> 07:53:05,740
so I'm gonna have to try and rest it a bit better

8084
07:53:05,740 --> 07:53:09,740
than usual, than the usual

8085
07:53:11,740 --> 07:53:13,740
when a game is this old.

8086
07:53:16,740 --> 07:53:18,740
Yes, if my voice wasn't sore,

8087
07:53:18,740 --> 07:53:20,740
I unironically just do 12 hours again.

8088
07:53:20,740 --> 07:53:21,740
I'm sorry.

8089
07:53:21,740 --> 07:53:22,740
I would. I said it.

8090
07:53:22,740 --> 07:53:24,740
I said what we're all thinking.

8091
07:53:24,740 --> 07:53:25,740
You all know what...

8092
07:53:25,740 --> 07:53:27,740
Oh no, I didn't cook those raw salmon.

8093
07:53:27,740 --> 07:53:29,740
Silly Billy.

8094
07:53:29,740 --> 07:53:31,740
Oh no, it's giving me the actual salmon.

8095
07:53:31,740 --> 07:53:33,740
Ah, oh well.

8096
07:53:33,740 --> 07:53:35,740
I'm not salmon maxing.

8097
07:53:35,740 --> 07:53:37,740
I'm not a real salmon max, so I can't believe it.

8098
07:53:37,740 --> 07:53:40,740
I'm sorry you had to all find out this way.

8099
07:53:40,740 --> 07:53:42,740
Let's do a try.

8100
07:53:43,740 --> 07:53:44,740
We're doing...

8101
07:53:44,740 --> 07:53:45,740
We're getting pretty good at try.

8102
07:53:45,740 --> 07:53:47,740
We're getting pretty good.

8103
07:53:47,740 --> 07:53:49,740
Over eight hours not endurance.

8104
07:53:49,740 --> 07:53:50,740
Come on now.

8105
07:53:50,740 --> 07:53:52,740
I don't know, I feel like...

8106
07:53:52,740 --> 07:53:54,740
You know when you have like a regular nine to five job?

8107
07:53:54,740 --> 07:53:57,740
Like, obviously I had quite a few.

8108
07:53:58,740 --> 07:54:00,740
And I just put it in perspective.

8109
07:54:00,740 --> 07:54:02,740
Like, I'm literally memeing about on a video game.

8110
07:54:02,740 --> 07:54:06,740
I get to like play and like have fun times with you.

8111
07:54:06,740 --> 07:54:08,740
And it just like...

8112
07:54:08,740 --> 07:54:09,740
Oh my god, wait.

8113
07:54:09,740 --> 07:54:10,740
Is this Trinna Man back?

8114
07:54:10,740 --> 07:54:12,740
Hold on, is Trinna Man back?

8115
07:54:12,740 --> 07:54:14,740
Trinna, I thought you had to go do some things

8116
07:54:14,740 --> 07:54:16,740
with your clan or something.

8117
07:54:16,740 --> 07:54:18,740
Oh my god, we're Trinna Maxing again.

8118
07:54:18,740 --> 07:54:19,740
Oh!

8119
07:54:19,740 --> 07:54:20,740
Half a million?

8120
07:54:20,740 --> 07:54:21,740
Are you sure?

8121
07:54:21,740 --> 07:54:23,740
I mean, I ain't gonna say no.

8122
07:54:23,740 --> 07:54:25,740
How are you all so rich?

8123
07:54:27,740 --> 07:54:28,740
Where are you...

8124
07:54:28,740 --> 07:54:30,740
What are you doing to make money in RuneScape?

8125
07:54:30,740 --> 07:54:34,740
What are the ways to buy some good fish with it?

8126
07:54:34,740 --> 07:54:35,740
Thank you, Reefling.

8127
07:54:35,740 --> 07:54:37,740
Oh my gosh, when the time comes.

8128
07:54:37,740 --> 07:54:39,740
Yes, when I don't burn stuff.

8129
07:54:39,740 --> 07:54:40,740
How...

8130
07:54:40,740 --> 07:54:43,740
I have three billion on an Iron Man account.

8131
07:54:43,740 --> 07:54:45,740
How do you make money in RuneScape?

8132
07:54:45,740 --> 07:54:46,740
Seriously?

8133
07:54:47,740 --> 07:54:48,740
Trinna Man!

8134
07:54:48,740 --> 07:54:49,740
How?

8135
07:54:52,740 --> 07:54:53,740
How do you make money on RuneScape?

8136
07:54:53,740 --> 07:54:54,740
I don't know how.

8137
07:54:54,740 --> 07:54:57,740
I'm gonna put this money in the bank so I'm not full.

8138
07:54:58,740 --> 07:55:01,740
The more you play, the higher stats you get raised.

8139
07:55:01,740 --> 07:55:02,740
Strawni get...

8140
07:55:02,740 --> 07:55:05,740
get hella high level so we can do raids.

8141
07:55:06,740 --> 07:55:07,740
Oh!

8142
07:55:07,740 --> 07:55:09,740
What's raiding?

8143
07:55:11,740 --> 07:55:13,740
Oh, you guys teach me how to raid.

8144
07:55:13,740 --> 07:55:17,740
International Bank of Strawni, honestly though.

8145
07:55:19,740 --> 07:55:22,740
Oh, I wanted to get a pet that looked like you guys as well.

8146
07:55:22,740 --> 07:55:23,740
That was another goal.

8147
07:55:23,740 --> 07:55:24,740
So 99...

8148
07:55:24,740 --> 07:55:25,740
Um...

8149
07:55:27,740 --> 07:55:30,740
99, um...

8150
07:55:30,740 --> 07:55:31,740
Cookin'.

8151
07:55:31,740 --> 07:55:33,740
And then I want to get a pet that looks like you guys.

8152
07:55:33,740 --> 07:55:35,740
But I don't know how the pets work.

8153
07:55:35,740 --> 07:55:37,740
Golly, double neck.

8154
07:55:37,740 --> 07:55:38,740
Okay.

8155
07:55:38,740 --> 07:55:40,740
I'm gonna go put this in the bank.

8156
07:55:40,740 --> 07:55:41,740
No, VC.

8157
07:55:42,740 --> 07:55:44,740
Math wants to choose.

8158
07:55:44,740 --> 07:55:46,740
Math, I don't have much inventory.

8159
07:55:46,740 --> 07:55:47,740
I'm sorry.

8160
07:55:48,740 --> 07:55:51,740
Oh yeah, give me them...

8161
07:55:51,740 --> 07:55:52,740
Sardines?

8162
07:55:52,740 --> 07:55:53,740
You giving me...

8163
07:55:53,740 --> 07:55:54,740
Oh!

8164
07:55:54,740 --> 07:55:57,740
Oh yeah, we got pike ladies and gentlemen.

8165
07:55:57,740 --> 07:55:58,740
Get that cooked.

8166
07:55:58,740 --> 07:56:00,740
Get that cooked on that fire thing.

8167
07:56:00,740 --> 07:56:01,740
Thank you.

8168
07:56:01,740 --> 07:56:02,740
Get that cooked.

8169
07:56:03,740 --> 07:56:05,740
Oh, it made me 39!

8170
07:56:05,740 --> 07:56:07,740
Economic Dragon Bitter.

8171
07:56:09,740 --> 07:56:12,740
Not to be confused with the German word bitter,

8172
07:56:12,740 --> 07:56:15,740
which means please, I think.

8173
07:56:15,740 --> 07:56:17,740
Bitter?

8174
07:56:17,740 --> 07:56:18,740
No.

8175
07:56:18,740 --> 07:56:21,740
I don't think that's what that means in German.

8176
07:56:22,740 --> 07:56:23,740
Hee-hee-hee.

8177
07:56:23,740 --> 07:56:25,740
Also high level drops peaking.

8178
07:56:25,740 --> 07:56:26,740
No, I couldn't do peaking.

8179
07:56:26,740 --> 07:56:27,740
Oh, I'm coming back.

8180
07:56:27,740 --> 07:56:29,740
Don't worry, Reeflings, I'm coming back.

8181
07:56:29,740 --> 07:56:31,740
Mummy's putting the money in the bank.

8182
07:56:31,740 --> 07:56:32,740
I'm coming back, okay?

8183
07:56:32,740 --> 07:56:35,740
Mummy needs to pay rent, so I'm putting it in the bank.

8184
07:56:35,740 --> 07:56:38,740
We need to rent that location out for only us.

8185
07:56:38,740 --> 07:56:40,740
Bitter means please, okay?

8186
07:56:40,740 --> 07:56:42,740
No, Reeflings, don't cry, I'm coming back.

8187
07:56:42,740 --> 07:56:44,740
Sorry, I forgot to say that, I needed to go.

8188
07:56:44,740 --> 07:56:46,740
I'm putting this in the bank, okay?

8189
07:56:46,740 --> 07:56:47,740
Look, bank.

8190
07:56:48,740 --> 07:56:49,740
And look at that.

8191
07:56:49,740 --> 07:56:50,740
We're max.

8192
07:56:50,740 --> 07:56:52,740
Look how much fish we've got.

8193
07:56:52,740 --> 07:56:54,740
200 raw ship.

8194
07:56:54,740 --> 07:56:57,740
600 salmon.

8195
07:56:57,740 --> 07:56:59,740
450 swordfish.

8196
07:56:59,740 --> 07:57:01,740
500 lobster's raw tuna.

8197
07:57:01,740 --> 07:57:02,740
Like, there's so much.

8198
07:57:02,740 --> 07:57:04,740
I don't want to burn any of this, though.

8199
07:57:05,740 --> 07:57:07,740
Bitter means you are welcome.

8200
07:57:07,740 --> 07:57:08,740
Oh, Dankeschon.

8201
07:57:08,740 --> 07:57:09,740
Bitter.

8202
07:57:09,740 --> 07:57:10,740
Okay, there we go.

8203
07:57:10,740 --> 07:57:12,740
There's a sentence that you could use in.

8204
07:57:12,740 --> 07:57:14,740
Oh, no, Dankeschon?

8205
07:57:14,740 --> 07:57:16,740
Or Dankeschon?

8206
07:57:16,740 --> 07:57:18,740
No, I think it has a kh.

8207
07:57:19,740 --> 07:57:21,740
Don't worry, Reeflings, I'm coming back.

8208
07:57:21,740 --> 07:57:23,740
Look, see, I'm coming, I'm coming.

8209
07:57:23,740 --> 07:57:25,740
Look, look, look, you're gonna render again.

8210
07:57:25,740 --> 07:57:26,740
Yay, Reeflings!

8211
07:57:26,740 --> 07:57:28,740
All the Reeflings are here.

8212
07:57:29,740 --> 07:57:31,740
You've got money to burn all that fish.

8213
07:57:31,740 --> 07:57:33,740
You're loaded, holy.

8214
07:57:33,740 --> 07:57:35,740
Literally, a Reefling gave me 10 million.

8215
07:57:35,740 --> 07:57:36,740
Another gave me a million.

8216
07:57:36,740 --> 07:57:38,740
One just gave me half a million there.

8217
07:57:38,740 --> 07:57:40,740
But I don't want to waste it.

8218
07:57:40,740 --> 07:57:42,740
I don't want to waste the money.

8219
07:57:44,740 --> 07:57:47,740
Oh, sorry, sorry, I accept.

8220
07:57:47,740 --> 07:57:49,740
Sorry, I'm fish-maxing, okay?

8221
07:57:49,740 --> 07:57:50,740
Where's Mommy?

8222
07:57:50,740 --> 07:57:52,740
Mommy's back, Mommy's back.

8223
07:57:54,740 --> 07:57:56,740
How much XP do you get for this?

8224
07:57:56,740 --> 07:57:58,740
I didn't even know you could fish it here.

8225
07:58:00,740 --> 07:58:02,740
Can't believe someone went...

8226
07:58:03,740 --> 07:58:04,740
What?

8227
07:58:04,740 --> 07:58:06,740
I can't believe someone went more dry

8228
07:58:06,740 --> 07:58:08,740
than I did on a dragonfish.

8229
07:58:09,740 --> 07:58:10,740
How much did we get?

8230
07:58:10,740 --> 07:58:12,740
Oh, we got A.A. for these?

8231
07:58:12,740 --> 07:58:14,740
These are the same as mine?

8232
07:58:15,740 --> 07:58:17,740
We cease to exist when you leave us.

8233
07:58:17,740 --> 07:58:19,740
No!

8234
07:58:19,740 --> 07:58:20,740
Reeflings!

8235
07:58:20,740 --> 07:58:22,740
Bitter means a bunch of things, including both.

8236
07:58:22,740 --> 07:58:23,740
Okay.

8237
07:58:25,740 --> 07:58:27,740
My German knowledge is expanding.

8238
07:58:29,740 --> 07:58:31,740
I know to expand

8239
07:58:32,740 --> 07:58:34,740
my Puerto Rican knowledge.

8240
07:58:35,740 --> 07:58:37,740
That's all you get.

8241
07:58:37,740 --> 07:58:38,740
Okay.

8242
07:58:43,740 --> 07:58:45,740
I don't know how many pets I got.

8243
07:58:45,740 --> 07:58:47,740
Can you own all the pets that won?

8244
07:58:48,740 --> 07:58:50,740
Oh, they're like little symbols to show what won.

8245
07:58:50,740 --> 07:58:52,740
There's 24 pets!

8246
07:58:54,740 --> 07:58:55,740
What?

8247
07:58:55,740 --> 07:58:56,740
How?

8248
07:59:00,740 --> 07:59:01,740
How's there 24?

8249
07:59:01,740 --> 07:59:03,740
There are 59 pets?

8250
07:59:04,740 --> 07:59:05,740
What?

8251
07:59:06,740 --> 07:59:08,740
That's a lot.

8252
07:59:09,740 --> 07:59:11,740
Yeah, especially now because I have a

8253
07:59:11,740 --> 07:59:13,740
chain made in a void worker jam.

8254
07:59:13,740 --> 07:59:15,740
Is that how you attract pets to you?

8255
07:59:15,740 --> 07:59:16,740
You wear jewelry?

8256
07:59:17,740 --> 07:59:18,740
They're like, ooh, shiny.

8257
07:59:18,740 --> 07:59:20,740
Is there a magpie pet?

8258
07:59:23,740 --> 07:59:25,740
What have we got?

8259
07:59:25,740 --> 07:59:27,740
Oh, actually, I've picked the place clean.

8260
07:59:27,740 --> 07:59:29,740
That's how much I'm fish-maxing.

8261
07:59:29,740 --> 07:59:30,740
There's nothing on the ground.

8262
07:59:30,740 --> 07:59:31,740
I've picked it clean.

8263
07:59:31,740 --> 07:59:32,740
Oh, wait.

8264
07:59:32,740 --> 07:59:33,740
There's a trade.

8265
07:59:33,740 --> 07:59:34,740
Ah!

8266
07:59:34,740 --> 07:59:35,740
I'm missing.

8267
07:59:36,740 --> 07:59:37,740
A rubbish aimbot.

8268
07:59:37,740 --> 07:59:38,740
Whoa, yeah.

8269
07:59:38,740 --> 07:59:39,740
17.

8270
07:59:39,740 --> 07:59:40,740
39.

8271
07:59:41,740 --> 07:59:42,740
All salmon.

8272
07:59:42,740 --> 07:59:44,740
We're all in on salmon.

8273
07:59:44,740 --> 07:59:46,740
Salmon cook and run.

8274
07:59:46,740 --> 07:59:48,740
We're almost level 40.

8275
07:59:48,740 --> 07:59:50,740
40's like a melody and...

8276
07:59:51,740 --> 07:59:52,740
Oh, sorry.

8277
07:59:52,740 --> 07:59:53,740
I just punched them.

8278
07:59:53,740 --> 07:59:54,740
I can hear that.

8279
07:59:54,740 --> 07:59:56,740
There's a little anime there.

8280
07:59:58,740 --> 07:59:59,740
Stronti only just starts streaming.

8281
07:59:59,740 --> 08:00:01,740
She's already a 1% earner in this game.

8282
08:00:01,740 --> 08:00:02,740
Wait, really?

8283
08:00:02,740 --> 08:00:05,740
Is level 40 a 1% thing?

8284
08:00:05,740 --> 08:00:08,740
Like, hardly anyone gets to 40 in something?

8285
08:00:10,740 --> 08:00:12,740
Shorty's like a melody and...

8286
08:00:13,740 --> 08:00:14,740
I can't keep growl.

8287
08:00:14,740 --> 08:00:15,740
Got me singing like...

8288
08:00:16,740 --> 08:00:17,740
Na na na na na.

8289
08:00:17,740 --> 08:00:18,740
Every day.

8290
08:00:18,740 --> 08:00:19,740
Like my eyes.

8291
08:00:19,740 --> 08:00:21,740
Is it like my eyeballs stuck on the plate?

8292
08:00:25,740 --> 08:00:26,740
Those bars were good.

8293
08:00:26,740 --> 08:00:28,740
She punched the refline.

8294
08:00:28,740 --> 08:00:29,740
I'm sorry.

8295
08:00:32,740 --> 08:00:33,740
There's a fishing pit,

8296
08:00:33,740 --> 08:00:35,740
but you have to be on a member's role to get it,

8297
08:00:35,740 --> 08:00:37,740
and scaling pits are especially good.

8298
08:00:38,740 --> 08:00:40,740
He means the money to do some...

8299
08:00:42,740 --> 08:00:43,740
We hit 40!

8300
08:00:43,740 --> 08:00:44,740
We hit 40!

8301
08:00:47,740 --> 08:00:48,740
Actually so good.

8302
08:00:49,740 --> 08:00:52,740
I might make one last cup of tea.

8303
08:00:52,740 --> 08:00:53,740
We need a lock-in.

8304
08:00:53,740 --> 08:00:55,740
We need a lock-in, okay.

8305
08:00:56,740 --> 08:00:57,740
Lobster time.

8306
08:00:57,740 --> 08:00:59,740
Oh no, I'm not gonna waste a lobster.

8307
08:00:59,740 --> 08:01:00,740
That's crazy.

8308
08:01:01,740 --> 08:01:03,740
I'm not gonna waste the lobsters.

8309
08:01:03,740 --> 08:01:04,740
Oh!

8310
08:01:04,740 --> 08:01:06,740
I mean, unless you give me lobsters,

8311
08:01:06,740 --> 08:01:07,740
that's different.

8312
08:01:07,740 --> 08:01:09,740
If you give me lobsters to waste,

8313
08:01:09,740 --> 08:01:10,740
that's different.

8314
08:01:10,740 --> 08:01:13,740
I'm not sure what my fricking rate is gonna be.

8315
08:01:14,740 --> 08:01:15,740
Burn them all.

8316
08:01:15,740 --> 08:01:17,740
Oh, I kicked my first one correctly!

8317
08:01:19,740 --> 08:01:20,740
Wah!

8318
08:01:20,740 --> 08:01:22,740
120?

8319
08:01:23,740 --> 08:01:24,740
Oh no!

8320
08:01:25,740 --> 08:01:26,740
They're getting burned.

8321
08:01:26,740 --> 08:01:27,740
I know you can't see them over my...

8322
08:01:27,740 --> 08:01:28,740
My heart.

8323
08:01:29,740 --> 08:01:32,740
Can I move myself over just a tiny bit more?

8324
08:01:35,740 --> 08:01:36,740
I don't want it.

8325
08:01:36,740 --> 08:01:37,740
Actually, yeah.

8326
08:01:37,740 --> 08:01:38,740
Yeah?

8327
08:01:39,740 --> 08:01:40,740
Okay, yeah, that's better.

8328
08:01:40,740 --> 08:01:42,740
You can, like, really see the inventory and stuff.

8329
08:01:43,740 --> 08:01:44,740
Learning.

8330
08:01:44,740 --> 08:01:45,740
We're gonna keep learning.

8331
08:01:47,740 --> 08:01:50,740
If all the boys get 40 fishing,

8332
08:01:50,740 --> 08:01:53,740
must the point will be for pure lobsters.

8333
08:01:54,740 --> 08:01:55,740
Wait, you wanna do lobsters?

8334
08:01:55,740 --> 08:01:57,740
Wait, you guys stay up all night

8335
08:01:57,740 --> 08:01:59,740
just so you can get 40 fishing?

8336
08:01:59,740 --> 08:02:01,740
So we can do lobster runs?

8337
08:02:01,740 --> 08:02:03,740
120 is a lot.

8338
08:02:03,740 --> 08:02:05,740
Look at the success rate, though.

8339
08:02:05,740 --> 08:02:06,740
What does it say?

8340
08:02:06,740 --> 08:02:08,740
Oh, the success rate is going up.

8341
08:02:08,740 --> 08:02:09,740
It's 20%.

8342
08:02:11,740 --> 08:02:12,740
What's that?

8343
08:02:12,740 --> 08:02:13,740
Oh, that's mine.

8344
08:02:13,740 --> 08:02:14,740
That's mine.

8345
08:02:18,740 --> 08:02:19,740
Oh, rest well, those two sleep.

8346
08:02:19,740 --> 08:02:21,740
I'm sorry, I streamed so long.

8347
08:02:22,740 --> 08:02:24,740
For those of you who do need to leave,

8348
08:02:24,740 --> 08:02:25,740
please don't worry.

8349
08:02:25,740 --> 08:02:26,740
I'm literally doing this until the end.

8350
08:02:26,740 --> 08:02:27,740
We're gonna read it in a mercy,

8351
08:02:27,740 --> 08:02:29,740
because my poor voice is feeling it, Mr. Prev.

8352
08:02:29,740 --> 08:02:31,740
There's no way you already have

8353
08:02:31,740 --> 08:02:34,740
more freaking lobsters for me or something.

8354
08:02:34,740 --> 08:02:35,740
Oh, okay, okay.

8355
08:02:35,740 --> 08:02:36,740
We go pick, go pick.

8356
08:02:36,740 --> 08:02:37,740
This is crazy.

8357
08:02:39,740 --> 08:02:41,740
This is crazy.

8358
08:02:41,740 --> 08:02:43,740
Can you get in trouble by Jagex

8359
08:02:43,740 --> 08:02:44,740
for doing this?

8360
08:02:45,740 --> 08:02:47,740
I can stay until 40, fish up or lobsters.

8361
08:02:47,740 --> 08:02:49,740
No, that's crazy.

8362
08:02:49,740 --> 08:02:51,740
I'm at 31 fishing at the moment.

8363
08:02:52,740 --> 08:02:55,740
I got distracted watching you

8364
08:02:55,740 --> 08:02:57,740
forgot to go back more.

8365
08:02:58,740 --> 08:03:00,740
Goodnight, sleepers, rest well.

8366
08:03:00,740 --> 08:03:02,740
Never can see how much seafood you are wasting.

8367
08:03:02,740 --> 08:03:03,740
No!

8368
08:03:05,740 --> 08:03:07,740
I just meant for the lobsters.

8369
08:03:07,740 --> 08:03:08,740
That one.

8370
08:03:08,740 --> 08:03:09,740
Long streams are good,

8371
08:03:09,740 --> 08:03:11,740
because I can catch them when I wake up.

8372
08:03:11,740 --> 08:03:15,740
I will sleep when I'm beat

8373
08:03:15,740 --> 08:03:18,740
by drowning by more domination of the cheese.

8374
08:03:19,740 --> 08:03:21,740
Oh, my God, we're almost 41.

8375
08:03:21,740 --> 08:03:22,740
Oh, freaking crazy.

8376
08:03:22,740 --> 08:03:24,740
We just wear a 40.

8377
08:03:24,740 --> 08:03:26,740
Sleep is a construct.

8378
08:03:26,740 --> 08:03:28,740
Construct is a government I've never given.

8379
08:03:29,740 --> 08:03:31,740
Oh, my gosh.

8380
08:03:33,740 --> 08:03:34,740
Can we do it?

8381
08:03:34,740 --> 08:03:36,740
Can we make it 41 already?

8382
08:03:38,740 --> 08:03:39,740
One more?

8383
08:03:39,740 --> 08:03:40,740
Don't burn them.

8384
08:03:40,740 --> 08:03:42,740
No, don't burn them.

8385
08:03:42,740 --> 08:03:43,740
I should burn it.

8386
08:03:43,740 --> 08:03:47,740
40 freaking one.

8387
08:03:47,740 --> 08:03:48,740
No!

8388
08:03:49,740 --> 08:03:51,740
This is so good.

8389
08:03:53,740 --> 08:03:54,740
Oh, my God.

8390
08:03:54,740 --> 08:03:56,740
You're already trading with me.

8391
08:03:59,740 --> 08:04:02,740
I hope I can't get in trouble by jargates from this.

8392
08:04:03,740 --> 08:04:05,740
Stuff like this can run the game for new players,

8393
08:04:05,740 --> 08:04:07,740
so be careful about donations for new players long term.

8394
08:04:09,740 --> 08:04:10,740
I have played,

8395
08:04:10,740 --> 08:04:12,740
I do have a basic concept of the game,

8396
08:04:12,740 --> 08:04:14,740
but if you're going to ask me to do

8397
08:04:14,740 --> 08:04:16,740
dungeoning and stuff,

8398
08:04:16,740 --> 08:04:18,740
I could not tell you where the gargoyles are,

8399
08:04:18,740 --> 08:04:20,740
but apparently gargoyles.

8400
08:04:20,740 --> 08:04:22,740
Hey, Strony, how do you get a fishing rod?

8401
08:04:22,740 --> 08:04:24,740
I've never tried this before.

8402
08:04:24,740 --> 08:04:26,740
Aw, you tiny culls.

8403
08:04:27,740 --> 08:04:29,740
You would have to level up

8404
08:04:29,740 --> 08:04:32,740
with that fishing net you got from Tutorial Island,

8405
08:04:32,740 --> 08:04:34,740
but you can't use it here.

8406
08:04:34,740 --> 08:04:36,740
You would have to go back to Lumbridge.

8407
08:04:36,740 --> 08:04:38,740
This is Lumbridge, where you came from.

8408
08:04:38,740 --> 08:04:40,740
You can use the magic spell to teleport,

8409
08:04:40,740 --> 08:04:44,740
and you have to do net fishing here until 20.

8410
08:04:44,740 --> 08:04:47,740
And then you can come here for a fly fishing.

8411
08:04:48,740 --> 08:04:50,740
I'm so sorry, Little Reefling.

8412
08:04:50,740 --> 08:04:52,740
There are gates to level up on fishing.

8413
08:04:52,740 --> 08:04:54,740
They're probably a lot better than my method,

8414
08:04:54,740 --> 08:04:56,740
but that's why I've always used it with the kids.

8415
08:04:56,740 --> 08:04:59,740
Gargoyles are decent money for mid players,

8416
08:04:59,740 --> 08:05:02,740
but 75 slayers is probably the slowest of them even.

8417
08:05:03,740 --> 08:05:06,740
That burn rate is looking a bit rough on the lobster,

8418
08:05:06,740 --> 08:05:08,740
so I'm not going to lie.

8419
08:05:08,740 --> 08:05:09,740
Anyone got some feathers on them?

8420
08:05:09,740 --> 08:05:11,740
So, well, I guess that's all great.

8421
08:05:11,740 --> 08:05:13,740
Aw, thank you, Little Reefling.

8422
08:05:15,740 --> 08:05:17,740
That burn rate is looking rough.

8423
08:05:19,740 --> 08:05:20,740
Oh, my God, what should I do?

8424
08:05:20,740 --> 08:05:21,740
I feel about it.

8425
08:05:23,740 --> 08:05:25,740
How expensive are the lobsters?

8426
08:05:25,740 --> 08:05:27,740
I feel like they're probably breaking through.

8427
08:05:29,740 --> 08:05:30,740
We're burnt through the fish already.

8428
08:05:30,740 --> 08:05:31,740
No, we're not.

8429
08:05:31,740 --> 08:05:32,740
I tell a lie.

8430
08:05:32,740 --> 08:05:33,740
Let's forget.

8431
08:05:33,740 --> 08:05:36,740
Who are you coming so fast?

8432
08:05:38,740 --> 08:05:39,740
You just handed me them.

8433
08:05:39,740 --> 08:05:41,740
Is there a bank nearby?

8434
08:05:42,740 --> 08:05:44,740
I thought the bank was over there.

8435
08:05:44,740 --> 08:05:45,740
Am I going crazy?

8436
08:05:45,740 --> 08:05:46,740
Is there a bank up there?

8437
08:05:47,740 --> 08:05:48,740
He's just disappeared again.

8438
08:05:48,740 --> 08:05:50,740
Is there a bank up there?

8439
08:05:51,740 --> 08:05:53,740
Ageville has a bank.

8440
08:05:53,740 --> 08:05:54,740
Oh, I'll make sure you...

8441
08:05:55,740 --> 08:05:56,740
Call meville,

8442
08:05:56,740 --> 08:05:58,740
because, I don't know, there's something.

8443
08:05:59,740 --> 08:06:01,740
If I could trade.

8444
08:06:01,740 --> 08:06:02,740
I'm so sorry.

8445
08:06:02,740 --> 08:06:03,740
Wait, I'll trade.

8446
08:06:03,740 --> 08:06:04,740
I'm sorry.

8447
08:06:04,740 --> 08:06:05,740
I'll trade.

8448
08:06:07,740 --> 08:06:08,740
Okay, I'll trade.

8449
08:06:08,740 --> 08:06:09,740
I'll trade.

8450
08:06:09,740 --> 08:06:10,740
I'll trade.

8451
08:06:10,740 --> 08:06:11,740
I'll trade.

8452
08:06:14,740 --> 08:06:15,740
Bro's hacking.

8453
08:06:16,740 --> 08:06:18,740
Can you even hack in RuneScape?

8454
08:06:18,740 --> 08:06:20,740
That sounds like it's nice and possible,

8455
08:06:20,740 --> 08:06:21,740
because of the way the server is.

8456
08:06:21,740 --> 08:06:23,740
Call meville, because I'm edging.

8457
08:06:23,740 --> 08:06:24,740
Yes!

8458
08:06:24,740 --> 08:06:25,740
Call meville, because I'm edging.

8459
08:06:29,740 --> 08:06:30,740
I came up with that myself.

8460
08:06:30,740 --> 08:06:31,740
I did.

8461
08:06:31,740 --> 08:06:32,740
I did.

8462
08:06:32,740 --> 08:06:33,740
It's true.

8463
08:06:33,740 --> 08:06:35,740
You could start using a range closer

8464
08:06:35,740 --> 08:06:37,740
to the bank rather than the fire rate,

8465
08:06:37,740 --> 08:06:39,740
since you don't fish in anymore.

8466
08:06:39,740 --> 08:06:40,740
Probably.

8467
08:06:41,740 --> 08:06:42,740
That's very true.

8468
08:06:48,740 --> 08:06:51,740
Oh, that burn rate is rough on those lobbies.

8469
08:06:52,740 --> 08:06:54,740
Every lobster that we burn is a missing,

8470
08:06:54,740 --> 08:06:56,740
like, 120, which is, like,

8471
08:06:56,740 --> 08:06:57,740
so frigging thingy.

8472
08:06:57,740 --> 08:06:58,740
I lied.

8473
08:06:58,740 --> 08:06:59,740
I made it.

8474
08:06:59,740 --> 08:07:01,740
Wait, there's another refling.

8475
08:07:01,740 --> 08:07:02,740
There's the strategy.

8476
08:07:02,740 --> 08:07:03,740
Hold on.

8477
08:07:05,740 --> 08:07:07,740
Wait, you've got lobster runs as well?

8478
08:07:08,740 --> 08:07:09,740
Whoa!

8479
08:07:10,740 --> 08:07:12,740
Isn't this not, like, thousands,

8480
08:07:12,740 --> 08:07:14,740
like, thousands of gold?

8481
08:07:14,740 --> 08:07:15,740
Am I not going mental?

8482
08:07:15,740 --> 08:07:16,740
I feel like this is, like, thousands.

8483
08:07:16,740 --> 08:07:17,740
Go ahead and run.

8484
08:07:17,740 --> 08:07:19,740
Energy needs to recharge.

8485
08:07:21,740 --> 08:07:22,740
Whoa, we got a full shoot.

8486
08:07:23,740 --> 08:07:24,740
Five in a row.

8487
08:07:25,740 --> 08:07:26,740
42!

8488
08:07:30,740 --> 08:07:32,740
It depends on how fast you want to get this level,

8489
08:07:32,740 --> 08:07:34,740
but Bar Village is more...

8490
08:07:35,740 --> 08:07:36,740
The most...

8491
08:07:36,740 --> 08:07:38,740
The most cooking ranges.

8492
08:07:43,740 --> 08:07:45,740
You can make a million per hour?

8493
08:07:47,740 --> 08:07:49,740
A million XP per hour?

8494
08:07:49,740 --> 08:07:50,740
Strony, even if it says

8495
08:07:50,740 --> 08:07:52,740
and you've already been given millions?

8496
08:07:52,740 --> 08:07:53,740
Honestly.

8497
08:07:53,740 --> 08:07:55,740
If you take the exclamation mark,

8498
08:07:55,740 --> 08:07:56,740
praise?

8499
08:07:56,740 --> 08:07:57,740
What?

8500
08:08:00,740 --> 08:08:01,740
Stop!

8501
08:08:01,740 --> 08:08:02,740
Did you make me...

8502
08:08:02,740 --> 08:08:04,740
Did you just make me fall for something obvious?

8503
08:08:05,740 --> 08:08:06,740
I don't know.

8504
08:08:18,740 --> 08:08:20,740
Yeah, I spent 160 on 2k.

8505
08:08:20,740 --> 08:08:21,740
That's, like, two voxels.

8506
08:08:23,740 --> 08:08:24,740
You have to take that.

8507
08:08:24,740 --> 08:08:25,740
I'm afterward.

8508
08:08:28,740 --> 08:08:29,740
Oh, knee drop, knee drop.

8509
08:08:29,740 --> 08:08:31,740
Oh, yeah, that was a much better lobster

8510
08:08:31,740 --> 08:08:33,740
cooking batch than the previous one,

8511
08:08:33,740 --> 08:08:35,740
the other one that I absolutely cooked with them.

8512
08:08:39,740 --> 08:08:40,740
Ooh, fishy.

8513
08:08:42,740 --> 08:08:44,740
Oh, right, okay, take that.

8514
08:08:45,740 --> 08:08:46,740
Let's try and do this.

8515
08:08:47,740 --> 08:08:48,740
Exclamation mark, praise?

8516
08:08:48,740 --> 08:08:50,740
Let it all be set to error.

8517
08:08:54,740 --> 08:08:55,740
Oh!

8518
08:08:55,740 --> 08:08:56,740
It worked!

8519
08:08:57,740 --> 08:08:59,740
Oh, there are 150 a pack?

8520
08:08:59,740 --> 08:09:00,740
Ooh.

8521
08:09:01,740 --> 08:09:04,740
If I buy feathers from people we drop on?

8522
08:09:04,740 --> 08:09:05,740
Okay, 300k.

8523
08:09:05,740 --> 08:09:06,740
Oh, great.

8524
08:09:07,740 --> 08:09:09,740
Right, don't buy any more fish,

8525
08:09:09,740 --> 08:09:11,740
cos it's literally I've got

8526
08:09:11,740 --> 08:09:14,740
less than 50 minutes now.

8527
08:09:14,740 --> 08:09:17,740
I'm gonna go quickly grab a bottle of water.

8528
08:09:18,740 --> 08:09:19,740
Cos I'm so thirsty.

8529
08:09:19,740 --> 08:09:20,740
I don't need to,

8530
08:09:20,740 --> 08:09:21,740
I don't need to,

8531
08:09:21,740 --> 08:09:22,740
I don't need to,

8532
08:09:22,740 --> 08:09:23,740
I don't need to,

8533
08:09:23,740 --> 08:09:24,740
I don't need to,

8534
08:09:24,740 --> 08:09:25,740
I don't need to,

8535
08:09:25,740 --> 08:09:26,740
I don't need to.

8536
08:09:26,740 --> 08:09:27,740
Ooh.

8537
08:09:46,740 --> 08:09:47,740
Wow!

8538
08:09:48,740 --> 08:09:49,740
Ooh, ooh, I hear burning noises.

8539
08:09:49,740 --> 08:09:50,740
I hear burning noises.

8540
08:09:51,740 --> 08:09:52,740
Cos we're burning deficies.

8541
08:09:53,740 --> 08:09:55,740
Right, I've got a new bowl of water.

8542
08:09:56,740 --> 08:09:59,540
I'm so hydrated, but I don't want to pee, I want to fish max.

8543
08:09:59,540 --> 08:10:01,820
I need to fish max, you don't understand.

8544
08:10:01,820 --> 08:10:03,940
I'm fish maxing, you wouldn't get it.

8545
08:10:05,900 --> 08:10:07,700
I have lobby maxing, you wouldn't get it.

8546
08:10:07,700 --> 08:10:09,380
You wouldn't understand, Mum.

8547
08:10:09,380 --> 08:10:10,620
Mum, I need membership.

8548
08:10:16,100 --> 08:10:18,460
I'll give it a try, I'll be back in a minute.

8549
08:10:18,460 --> 08:10:19,300
Go for it.

8550
08:10:20,460 --> 08:10:22,140
I've only been listening to ASMR for about a minute,

8551
08:10:22,140 --> 08:10:23,580
so I'm excited for starting ASMR.

8552
08:10:25,020 --> 08:10:26,180
I definitely am not the best.

8553
08:10:26,180 --> 08:10:30,380
I would say like, Mercy and Icy are like super professional.

8554
08:10:30,380 --> 08:10:31,740
Super idol.

8555
08:10:32,740 --> 08:10:34,780
43!

8556
08:10:34,780 --> 08:10:36,380
And we've had a lot of two-stacked...

8557
08:10:36,380 --> 08:10:37,980
Oh, I was about to say, we've got two-stacked

8558
08:10:37,980 --> 08:10:40,020
for all of the lobbies not being burnt.

8559
08:10:41,260 --> 08:10:42,420
Spoke too soon there.

8560
08:10:46,500 --> 08:10:47,620
Hydration check.

8561
08:10:49,940 --> 08:10:50,940
Wow.

8562
08:10:51,940 --> 08:10:58,740
You know, as much as the chef hat and the apron are made out of gold,

8563
08:10:58,740 --> 08:11:00,940
I don't think it's actually making me a better chef.

8564
08:11:05,540 --> 08:11:07,740
How much longer before you have to leave?

8565
08:11:07,740 --> 08:11:08,780
Is there a exact time?

8566
08:11:08,780 --> 08:11:11,060
Mercy is coming on in 45 minutes.

8567
08:11:11,060 --> 08:11:14,380
I'm going to redirect into her because I need to do vocal rest

8568
08:11:14,380 --> 08:11:16,500
before the ASMR stream tomorrow.

8569
08:11:16,500 --> 08:11:18,900
And it hurts to talk right now, which is a shame.

8570
08:11:18,900 --> 08:11:20,820
It's literally the only reason I'm going offline.

8571
08:11:20,820 --> 08:11:23,620
I probably didn't during the stream every single day if I killed it, honestly.

8572
08:11:25,420 --> 08:11:30,420
But my voice is sore and I need to be quiet for the ASMR.

8573
08:11:30,420 --> 08:11:32,220
Tomorrow's going to be a short...

8574
08:11:32,220 --> 08:11:35,020
No, you guys are so quick on it.

8575
08:11:36,420 --> 08:11:37,620
This is crazy.

8576
08:11:38,420 --> 08:11:39,300
It doesn't make sense.

8577
08:11:39,300 --> 08:11:41,220
They're gold, literally.

8578
08:11:42,420 --> 08:11:43,780
Drink some nice hot tea.

8579
08:11:43,780 --> 08:11:45,940
Yes, I've had too much tea today.

8580
08:11:45,940 --> 08:11:47,740
Because I put honey in my tea,

8581
08:11:47,740 --> 08:11:51,340
it gets, like, sickly if I have too much of it,

8582
08:11:51,340 --> 08:11:53,700
so I have to swap to water only.

8583
08:11:54,900 --> 08:11:56,980
What's your target that you're going for this stream?

8584
08:11:56,980 --> 08:12:01,900
I wanted to get 50, but I don't think it's possible because of time.

8585
08:12:01,900 --> 08:12:06,260
I didn't realise how fast cooking the fish was going to be

8586
08:12:06,260 --> 08:12:08,020
if I wasn't, like, doing those quests.

8587
08:12:08,020 --> 08:12:12,300
But I had fun doing quests for the reason, so actually, I don't really regret it at all.

8588
08:12:12,300 --> 08:12:13,980
I'll be cutting it close.

8589
08:12:13,980 --> 08:12:17,660
Like, if we're literally, like, a couple of minutes away, then I'll do it.

8590
08:12:17,700 --> 08:12:20,100
But, unfortunately, my voice is, like...

8591
08:12:20,100 --> 08:12:21,100
Yeah.

8592
08:12:21,100 --> 08:12:24,580
And most of all, I felt that one literally...

8593
08:12:25,580 --> 08:12:27,020
I do look stylish, though.

8594
08:12:27,020 --> 08:12:27,940
I mean, look at that.

8595
08:12:27,940 --> 08:12:29,860
Something a little cosy.

8596
08:12:32,180 --> 08:12:34,380
Look at the detail in my eyes and everything.

8597
08:12:34,380 --> 08:12:37,180
The polys are the favourites all the time.

8598
08:12:38,700 --> 08:12:39,660
Honey in tea is good.

8599
08:12:39,660 --> 08:12:41,700
Maybe I'll add less honey.

8600
08:12:41,700 --> 08:12:42,220
I don't know.

8601
08:12:42,220 --> 08:12:44,860
I feel, like, sickly if I...

8602
08:12:44,860 --> 08:12:46,060
I don't know, I just can't.

8603
08:12:46,060 --> 08:12:47,460
It's just not working.

8604
08:12:48,660 --> 08:12:50,340
It's just not working.

8605
08:12:51,820 --> 08:12:55,460
I know you can have those throat sweets,

8606
08:12:55,460 --> 08:13:00,780
but I don't know if they actually do anything or just, like, make my teeth feel a little sugary.

8607
08:13:00,780 --> 08:13:02,540
It's, like, my biggest frickin' thing.

8608
08:13:02,540 --> 08:13:03,180
Wait, hold on.

8609
08:13:03,180 --> 08:13:04,420
Am I taking this?

8610
08:13:04,420 --> 08:13:06,580
I can't remember who I keep taking off of.

8611
08:13:07,580 --> 08:13:12,540
I'm sorry for whoever the other lobster runners, like, I can't remember between...

8612
08:13:13,740 --> 08:13:15,900
200k feathers under me.

8613
08:13:15,900 --> 08:13:16,420
Damn.

8614
08:13:17,420 --> 08:13:17,940
Damn.

8615
08:13:19,780 --> 08:13:21,620
Damn, you're in a wedding dress and everything.

8616
08:13:21,620 --> 08:13:22,420
What the heck?

8617
08:13:23,220 --> 08:13:25,220
All of your black hair, this is cute.

8618
08:13:25,220 --> 08:13:26,580
And your little cape.

8619
08:13:26,580 --> 08:13:28,220
Oh, I forgot to get us green capes.

8620
08:13:28,220 --> 08:13:28,980
Oops.

8621
08:13:28,980 --> 08:13:29,820
We'll do the next thing.

8622
08:13:31,140 --> 08:13:32,740
Can you say throat sweets again?

8623
08:13:32,740 --> 08:13:33,420
Yeah, throat sweets.

8624
08:13:34,540 --> 08:13:37,180
They, like, help with your throat when you feel sick or whatever.

8625
08:13:37,180 --> 08:13:39,020
Or if you've got strain, I guess.

8626
08:13:41,380 --> 08:13:42,300
Are you still streaming?

8627
08:13:42,300 --> 08:13:45,820
Yeah, um, we've got roughly 40 minutes.

8628
08:13:45,860 --> 08:13:47,140
And then it's Mercy's time.

8629
08:13:47,140 --> 08:13:48,660
We're gonna redirect into Mercy.

8630
08:13:50,380 --> 08:13:51,980
Bon bon.

8631
08:13:58,620 --> 08:14:02,140
Oh, I'm making an absolute mockery of this one.

8632
08:14:02,140 --> 08:14:03,540
I don't think I'm gonna burn it, alright.

8633
08:14:03,540 --> 08:14:04,100
Yeah.

8634
08:14:04,860 --> 08:14:06,740
Oh, we're close to the 44, though.

8635
08:14:10,780 --> 08:14:11,540
Bicola.

8636
08:14:13,340 --> 08:14:14,340
Wait, Bicola?

8637
08:14:16,820 --> 08:14:17,820
Wait, what's Bicola?

8638
08:14:19,820 --> 08:14:21,820
I can hear that, Bicola.

8639
08:14:21,820 --> 08:14:22,820
What's that mean, chan?

8640
08:14:22,820 --> 08:14:23,820
Huh?

8641
08:14:23,820 --> 08:14:24,820
Eto?

8642
08:14:24,820 --> 08:14:25,820
What's that?

8643
08:14:25,820 --> 08:14:26,820
Bicola.

8644
08:14:31,820 --> 08:14:34,820
A tape of throat lozenger.

8645
08:14:34,820 --> 08:14:35,820
Oh, it's a cough drug.

8646
08:14:35,820 --> 08:14:37,820
Bicola is a brand of lozenger.

8647
08:14:37,820 --> 08:14:38,820
Oh, okay, okay.

8648
08:14:38,820 --> 08:14:39,820
Oh, sorry.

8649
08:14:40,820 --> 08:14:41,820
Wah.

8650
08:14:41,820 --> 08:14:42,820
Here you go.

8651
08:14:42,820 --> 08:14:43,820
Here you go.

8652
08:14:45,820 --> 08:14:46,820
Lobster runner.

8653
08:14:46,820 --> 08:14:47,820
I can't believe it.

8654
08:14:47,820 --> 08:14:49,820
Might as well do 99 room crafting while we're at it.

8655
08:14:49,820 --> 08:14:51,820
You guys will make it super easy.

8656
08:14:54,820 --> 08:14:57,820
It's the comical jingle that was very common.

8657
08:14:57,820 --> 08:14:59,820
Oh, it's a commercial jingle.

8658
08:14:59,820 --> 08:15:00,820
Sorry.

8659
08:15:01,820 --> 08:15:03,820
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

8660
08:15:04,820 --> 08:15:05,820
But not I see smokers.

8661
08:15:05,820 --> 08:15:06,820
But I see.

8662
08:15:09,820 --> 08:15:10,820
There's a new...

8663
08:15:12,820 --> 08:15:14,820
New room craft minigame, and it's fun.

8664
08:15:15,820 --> 08:15:17,820
Anyone else able to see the feathers yet?

8665
08:15:17,820 --> 08:15:20,820
No, you might have to pick them up in case it's too much when you defawn.

8666
08:15:22,820 --> 08:15:24,820
No feathers.

8667
08:15:27,820 --> 08:15:29,820
Yeah, hopefully they don't defawn,

8668
08:15:29,820 --> 08:15:31,820
because 20k feathers isn't cheap.

8669
08:15:35,820 --> 08:15:37,820
Did you time the six feathers?

8670
08:15:37,820 --> 08:15:38,820
Johnny's so cool and got excited.

8671
08:15:38,820 --> 08:15:39,820
This is Coca-Cola.

8672
08:15:39,820 --> 08:15:40,820
It's so much.

8673
08:15:42,820 --> 08:15:43,820
How long does it take after doffin'?

8674
08:15:43,820 --> 08:15:45,820
I thought it was 60 seconds.

8675
08:15:46,820 --> 08:15:49,820
If it's been 60 seconds, I would just scoop them back up again,

8676
08:15:49,820 --> 08:15:50,820
because I would hate them to...

8677
08:15:50,820 --> 08:15:52,820
No, not the headbinds!

8678
08:15:57,820 --> 08:15:58,820
What a book.

8679
08:15:58,820 --> 08:15:59,820
Wah.

8680
08:16:00,820 --> 08:16:02,820
Level 40 fricking four.

8681
08:16:03,820 --> 08:16:06,820
If I could stop fricking burning them lobsters,

8682
08:16:06,820 --> 08:16:07,820
they'll...

8683
08:16:07,820 --> 08:16:08,820
Wah.

8684
08:16:08,820 --> 08:16:10,820
They'll accept trade, accept trade.

8685
08:16:18,820 --> 08:16:19,820
We're getting there though.

8686
08:16:20,820 --> 08:16:22,820
Do you have less burn chance on a...

8687
08:16:22,820 --> 08:16:24,820
a grill thing?

8688
08:16:24,820 --> 08:16:25,820
An oven?

8689
08:16:25,820 --> 08:16:27,820
A grill thing.

8690
08:16:28,820 --> 08:16:30,820
30 seconds to appear to others,

8691
08:16:30,820 --> 08:16:32,820
three minutes to despawn.

8692
08:16:32,820 --> 08:16:33,820
We're learning.

8693
08:16:33,820 --> 08:16:35,820
We're learning the ways a burn stage is done.

8694
08:16:41,820 --> 08:16:44,820
No only in whose side it is.

8695
08:16:46,820 --> 08:16:47,820
Wah.

8696
08:16:47,820 --> 08:16:50,820
Range and fire are the same kissing chance, mostly.

8697
08:16:50,820 --> 08:16:51,820
Okay, there's no point.

8698
08:16:51,820 --> 08:16:55,820
I was like, maybe we should move this production line,

8699
08:16:55,820 --> 08:16:56,820
but...

8700
08:16:56,820 --> 08:16:58,820
I think the rooflings are just fishing away.

8701
08:16:58,820 --> 08:17:00,820
They're just having a good time.

8702
08:17:02,820 --> 08:17:05,820
We definitely need to level ourselves up,

8703
08:17:05,820 --> 08:17:08,820
because we're the target for a lot of NPCs

8704
08:17:08,820 --> 08:17:11,820
when we're trying to travel through areas.

8705
08:17:16,820 --> 08:17:17,820
The stream's ending in 40 minutes.

8706
08:17:17,820 --> 08:17:19,820
Does that mean brush teeth intend?

8707
08:17:19,820 --> 08:17:20,820
Yes!

8708
08:17:20,820 --> 08:17:21,820
We have to brush our teeth.

8709
08:17:23,820 --> 08:17:25,820
Okay, thank goodness I didn't make another teeth,

8710
08:17:25,820 --> 08:17:27,820
because I wouldn't have been able to brush my teeth.

8711
08:17:29,820 --> 08:17:30,820
If you're having...

8712
08:17:30,820 --> 08:17:32,820
If you want to brush your teeth with us

8713
08:17:33,820 --> 08:17:35,820
for your enameled...

8714
08:17:35,820 --> 08:17:38,820
Don't eat or drink fizzy juice.

8715
08:17:39,820 --> 08:17:41,820
You can have water for the next 30 minutes,

8716
08:17:41,820 --> 08:17:44,820
but you're not to brush your teeth if you've eaten

8717
08:17:44,820 --> 08:17:46,820
after 30 minutes,

8718
08:17:46,820 --> 08:17:48,820
because it hurts your enamel

8719
08:17:48,820 --> 08:17:50,820
rather than helping it.

8720
08:17:50,820 --> 08:17:52,820
I think that's my only note

8721
08:17:52,820 --> 08:17:54,820
if you want to brush your teeth with us.

8722
08:17:55,820 --> 08:17:56,820
Not so fun story.

8723
08:17:56,820 --> 08:17:58,820
My brother once choked on one

8724
08:17:58,820 --> 08:18:00,820
of those throat sweeps

8725
08:18:00,820 --> 08:18:02,820
and helped with the throat throat.

8726
08:18:03,820 --> 08:18:05,820
Ooh, that's terrifying.

8727
08:18:06,820 --> 08:18:08,820
45?

8728
08:18:09,820 --> 08:18:10,820
45?

8729
08:18:10,820 --> 08:18:11,820
45?

8730
08:18:11,820 --> 08:18:13,820
We're at 61 8 feet.

8731
08:18:13,820 --> 08:18:14,820
Oh, goodness.

8732
08:18:14,820 --> 08:18:15,820
We may actually make the 50.

8733
08:18:15,820 --> 08:18:16,820
You know that.

8734
08:18:19,820 --> 08:18:21,820
Ah, my throat farted when I swallowed it.

8735
08:18:21,820 --> 08:18:22,820
Did you hear that?

8736
08:18:22,820 --> 08:18:24,820
That was like an internal throat fart.

8737
08:18:31,820 --> 08:18:33,820
I said that!

8738
08:18:37,820 --> 08:18:38,820
1 in 3.

8739
08:18:39,820 --> 08:18:40,820
Oh, baby.

8740
08:18:43,820 --> 08:18:46,820
He learned so much from this educational

8741
08:18:46,820 --> 08:18:48,820
and professional streamer.

8742
08:18:48,820 --> 08:18:50,820
That takes me back to the toothbrush

8743
08:18:50,820 --> 08:18:51,820
somewhere.

8744
08:18:58,820 --> 08:19:00,820
We are so going to get 50

8745
08:19:00,820 --> 08:19:02,820
before Mercy comes on and makes me funny.

8746
08:19:02,820 --> 08:19:04,820
Oh, Mercy's actually...

8747
08:19:04,820 --> 08:19:06,820
I think she's decorating alternative

8748
08:19:06,820 --> 08:19:08,820
outfits for us.

8749
08:19:08,820 --> 08:19:09,820
So...

8750
08:19:09,820 --> 08:19:11,820
We are in...

8751
08:19:12,820 --> 08:19:14,820
Have our lobster reserves ran dry.

8752
08:19:14,820 --> 08:19:16,820
Have I perished all the lobsters

8753
08:19:16,820 --> 08:19:18,820
for sale in the Grand Exchange?

8754
08:19:19,820 --> 08:19:20,820
Oh, unless.

8755
08:19:20,820 --> 08:19:21,820
Unless.

8756
08:19:21,820 --> 08:19:22,820
Unless.

8757
08:19:24,820 --> 08:19:27,820
You guys are sweating to get me to level 99.

8758
08:19:27,820 --> 08:19:28,820
You're actually so kind.

8759
08:19:28,820 --> 08:19:30,820
I just want to say a special thank you

8760
08:19:30,820 --> 08:19:31,820
for those of you who are like

8761
08:19:31,820 --> 08:19:33,820
unironically feeding me.

8762
08:19:33,820 --> 08:19:34,820
This is going to make the school

8763
08:19:34,820 --> 08:19:36,820
way faster doing this.

8764
08:19:37,820 --> 08:19:38,820
Hmm.

8765
08:19:45,820 --> 08:19:47,820
You'd say that Stronny's a really good drop.

8766
08:19:47,820 --> 08:19:48,820
What?

8767
08:19:49,820 --> 08:19:51,820
Do you think she'd make you one of those?

8768
08:19:51,820 --> 08:19:52,820
What?

8769
08:19:53,820 --> 08:19:54,820
What is going on?

8770
08:19:55,820 --> 08:19:57,820
No stops on this lobster train.

8771
08:19:57,820 --> 08:19:58,820
Literally.

8772
08:20:02,820 --> 08:20:04,820
I know the fishing spot.

8773
08:20:07,820 --> 08:20:09,820
Nearly one million XP an hour.

8774
08:20:09,820 --> 08:20:10,820
Stop.

8775
08:20:10,820 --> 08:20:11,820
Is that it?

8776
08:20:11,820 --> 08:20:12,820
Unlucky.

8777
08:20:13,820 --> 08:20:14,820
I love stories.

8778
08:20:15,820 --> 08:20:17,820
I suppose if I didn't burn them,

8779
08:20:17,820 --> 08:20:18,820
that's very plausible.

8780
08:20:18,820 --> 08:20:20,820
Every stack is like...

8781
08:20:21,820 --> 08:20:23,820
What, 26 inventory?

8782
08:20:24,820 --> 08:20:25,820
Like...

8783
08:20:27,820 --> 08:20:29,820
I think five tables are shooting it.

8784
08:20:29,820 --> 08:20:30,820
I don't know.

8785
08:20:30,820 --> 08:20:32,820
With some tick manipulation.

8786
08:20:32,820 --> 08:20:34,820
I don't know what the tick rate manipulation

8787
08:20:34,820 --> 08:20:35,820
stuff means.

8788
08:20:35,820 --> 08:20:37,820
I hear it all the time though.

8789
08:20:38,820 --> 08:20:39,820
It's like, oh you just got to make sure

8790
08:20:39,820 --> 08:20:40,820
you do this on the tick

8791
08:20:40,820 --> 08:20:41,820
and you have to eat.

8792
08:20:41,820 --> 08:20:42,820
You have to eat the food on the tick.

8793
08:20:42,820 --> 08:20:44,820
Oh, can I swap out prayer?

8794
08:20:44,820 --> 08:20:45,820
I need a prayer flick.

8795
08:20:45,820 --> 08:20:46,820
I need a prayer flick.

8796
08:20:46,820 --> 08:20:48,820
Like, I'm like, what does any of this mean?

8797
08:20:51,820 --> 08:20:52,820
You're crazy.

8798
08:20:52,820 --> 08:20:53,820
Crazy.

8799
08:20:55,820 --> 08:20:57,820
Also, for those of you using runelight,

8800
08:20:57,820 --> 08:21:00,820
if you don't want an item name to show up,

8801
08:21:01,820 --> 08:21:02,820
can hold,

8802
08:21:03,820 --> 08:21:04,820
alt,

8803
08:21:04,820 --> 08:21:05,820
and write...

8804
08:21:06,820 --> 08:21:07,820
the irons here.

8805
08:21:08,820 --> 08:21:10,820
We're getting the real stress here.

8806
08:21:13,820 --> 08:21:16,820
Being an apron has always been a dream of mine.

8807
08:21:17,820 --> 08:21:21,820
The game runs on 0.62nd increments called ticks.

8808
08:21:21,820 --> 08:21:22,820
That's it.

8809
08:21:22,820 --> 08:21:23,820
Oh!

8810
08:21:25,820 --> 08:21:26,820
That basic...

8811
08:21:26,820 --> 08:21:29,820
Okay, that just like explains everything.

8812
08:21:31,820 --> 08:21:32,820
That's it.

8813
08:21:32,820 --> 08:21:33,820
That's all it took.

8814
08:21:33,820 --> 08:21:35,820
One sentence and it all makes sense.

8815
08:21:35,820 --> 08:21:37,820
Okay, because I was like,

8816
08:21:37,820 --> 08:21:39,820
prayer, I need prayer flick on this tick.

8817
08:21:39,820 --> 08:21:41,820
Like, over prayer flick.

8818
08:21:41,820 --> 08:21:42,820
I'm like, what?

8819
08:21:42,820 --> 08:21:44,820
I'm not, I'm even sure that's supposed to be

8820
08:21:44,820 --> 08:21:45,820
having the games played.

8821
08:21:45,820 --> 08:21:46,820
I don't know.

8822
08:21:46,820 --> 08:21:47,820
Did the devs intend that?

8823
08:21:47,820 --> 08:21:48,820
But they never patched it out.

8824
08:21:48,820 --> 08:21:49,820
So I guess prayer

8825
08:21:49,820 --> 08:21:51,820
flicking is the right way to go.

8826
08:21:52,820 --> 08:21:54,820
Because prayer drains so fast.

8827
08:21:55,820 --> 08:22:00,820
I'm getting new brain cells just from streaming.

8828
08:22:02,820 --> 08:22:03,820
Level 47?

8829
08:22:04,820 --> 08:22:05,820
No.

8830
08:22:06,820 --> 08:22:07,820
Oh wait, sorry, 46.

8831
08:22:08,820 --> 08:22:09,820
Two more.

8832
08:22:09,820 --> 08:22:10,820
If I don't burn these.

8833
08:22:10,820 --> 08:22:11,820
If I don't burn this one.

8834
08:22:13,820 --> 08:22:14,820
46.

8835
08:22:15,820 --> 08:22:16,820
Oh my gosh.

8836
08:22:18,820 --> 08:22:19,820
We're so MLG pro.

8837
08:22:21,820 --> 08:22:22,820
Look at me, bro.

8838
08:22:23,820 --> 08:22:24,820
Look at me, bro.

8839
08:22:24,820 --> 08:22:25,820
MLG pro.

8840
08:22:27,820 --> 08:22:28,820
Let me see.

8841
08:22:28,820 --> 08:22:29,820
Oh my god, my tummy's rumbling.

8842
08:22:29,820 --> 08:22:30,820
You could hear that over the background.

8843
08:22:31,820 --> 08:22:32,820
Wow.

8844
08:22:34,820 --> 08:22:35,820
I'm literally slid.

8845
08:22:37,820 --> 08:22:38,820
It's not intended,

8846
08:22:38,820 --> 08:22:40,820
but Jagex just accepted.

8847
08:22:40,820 --> 08:22:41,820
I was going to say,

8848
08:22:41,820 --> 08:22:42,820
if they didn't,

8849
08:22:42,820 --> 08:22:44,820
whenever like something gets discovered,

8850
08:22:44,820 --> 08:22:47,820
like, so this is for the overwatch players,

8851
08:22:47,820 --> 08:22:49,820
but Mercy had a guardian angel leap.

8852
08:22:50,820 --> 08:22:53,820
And it got discovered

8853
08:22:53,820 --> 08:22:55,820
and it was never patched out the game,

8854
08:22:55,820 --> 08:22:56,820
which meant it was intended,

8855
08:22:56,820 --> 08:22:58,820
even though it was never described.

8856
08:22:59,820 --> 08:23:00,820
So that's how I take it.

8857
08:23:00,820 --> 08:23:02,820
If the devs don't patch it out,

8858
08:23:02,820 --> 08:23:04,820
it's allowed, basically.

8859
08:23:05,820 --> 08:23:07,820
Once you get to level 92,

8860
08:23:07,820 --> 08:23:08,820
you're halfway there.

8861
08:23:08,820 --> 08:23:09,820
Yay.

8862
08:23:10,820 --> 08:23:11,820
Anyway, congrats, dumb dumb.

8863
08:23:11,820 --> 08:23:13,820
This was the stream I was looking forward.

8864
08:23:13,820 --> 08:23:14,820
The less,

8865
08:23:14,820 --> 08:23:16,820
but ended up probably being one of the funniest,

8866
08:23:16,820 --> 08:23:17,820
really?

8867
08:23:18,820 --> 08:23:19,820
It's just me receiving,

8868
08:23:19,820 --> 08:23:22,820
like, tons of in-game currency for doing nothing.

8869
08:23:25,820 --> 08:23:26,820
But please don't worry,

8870
08:23:26,820 --> 08:23:27,820
if you're interested in more,

8871
08:23:27,820 --> 08:23:28,820
like, multiplayer games

8872
08:23:28,820 --> 08:23:30,820
where we can play together,

8873
08:23:30,820 --> 08:23:31,820
I definitely am doing,

8874
08:23:31,820 --> 08:23:34,820
like, a whole variety of things going on.

8875
08:23:40,820 --> 08:23:41,820
I would definitely, like,

8876
08:23:41,820 --> 08:23:42,820
other ones, like...

8877
08:23:45,820 --> 08:23:46,820
No, that's not what's official name.

8878
08:23:46,820 --> 08:23:47,820
What's the name of the game?

8879
08:23:48,820 --> 08:23:49,820
Fall Guys.

8880
08:23:50,820 --> 08:23:52,820
I wanted to give Fortnite a chance.

8881
08:23:52,820 --> 08:23:54,820
Apparently, Fortnite

8882
08:23:54,820 --> 08:23:56,820
has added, like, different game modes.

8883
08:23:58,820 --> 08:24:01,820
Call of Duty has apparently introduced prop one.

8884
08:24:01,820 --> 08:24:02,820
I don't know if we could...

8885
08:24:02,820 --> 08:24:03,820
Oh, there's a captain.

8886
08:24:03,820 --> 08:24:06,820
Do we do the captain mini-quest?

8887
08:24:07,820 --> 08:24:10,820
I don't know if we do the captain one.

8888
08:24:11,820 --> 08:24:14,820
At the Fortnite metal path.

8889
08:24:15,820 --> 08:24:18,820
I just shit out my hands.

8890
08:24:18,820 --> 08:24:19,820
It's...

8891
08:24:19,820 --> 08:24:21,820
Is it bad?

8892
08:24:22,820 --> 08:24:24,820
Is it a bad quest?

8893
08:24:24,820 --> 08:24:25,820
Is it the captain,

8894
08:24:25,820 --> 08:24:27,820
or is it a good one?

8895
08:24:27,820 --> 08:24:28,820
It's quick.

8896
08:24:28,820 --> 08:24:30,820
Okay, if it's quick, let's try it.

8897
08:24:30,820 --> 08:24:32,820
Problem is, these old-time...

8898
08:24:32,820 --> 08:24:35,820
Uh, sure, I'll help you unlock your chest.

8899
08:24:35,820 --> 08:24:37,820
There are three columns.

8900
08:24:37,820 --> 08:24:38,820
What you need to do is match up

8901
08:24:38,820 --> 08:24:40,820
each picture on the column.

8902
08:24:41,820 --> 08:24:42,820
A bar,

8903
08:24:43,820 --> 08:24:44,820
a ring,

8904
08:24:44,820 --> 08:24:45,820
and a bowl.

8905
08:24:49,820 --> 08:24:51,820
Oh, got a wee golden ring!

8906
08:24:52,820 --> 08:24:53,820
Um...

8907
08:24:54,820 --> 08:24:55,820
What'd I do with it?

8908
08:24:55,820 --> 08:24:56,820
I already have a diamond ring on

8909
08:24:56,820 --> 08:24:57,820
from a wreathling,

8910
08:24:57,820 --> 08:24:58,820
so I can't take it off.

8911
08:25:01,820 --> 08:25:02,820
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.

8912
08:25:02,820 --> 08:25:03,820
I completely forgot

8913
08:25:03,820 --> 08:25:05,820
we're trying to lobster max right now.

8914
08:25:05,820 --> 08:25:06,820
Oops.

8915
08:25:07,820 --> 08:25:08,820
One less space,

8916
08:25:08,820 --> 08:25:09,820
one less space,

8917
08:25:09,820 --> 08:25:11,820
because I'll drop the golden ring.

8918
08:25:16,820 --> 08:25:17,820
Oh, I could have gave you

8919
08:25:17,820 --> 08:25:18,820
the golden ring, actually,

8920
08:25:18,820 --> 08:25:21,820
because lobsters trading there.

8921
08:25:21,820 --> 08:25:23,820
The ring's your problem now.

8922
08:25:26,820 --> 08:25:28,820
Captain is the worst random?

8923
08:25:28,820 --> 08:25:29,820
No.

8924
08:25:30,820 --> 08:25:31,820
The sign which lady is,

8925
08:25:31,820 --> 08:25:33,820
she never gives you anything good.

8926
08:25:35,820 --> 08:25:36,820
Hail divers,

8927
08:25:36,820 --> 08:25:37,820
mollo player.

8928
08:25:37,820 --> 08:25:38,820
Is that easy to say at all?

8929
08:25:45,820 --> 08:25:46,820
Well, sign which lady

8930
08:25:46,820 --> 08:25:48,820
and quiz master already.

8931
08:25:49,820 --> 08:25:50,820
Quiz master's rubbish,

8932
08:25:50,820 --> 08:25:52,820
I don't like that one.

8933
08:25:54,820 --> 08:25:55,820
Uh, for...

8934
08:25:55,820 --> 08:25:57,820
Stroudy, please don't play Fortnite.

8935
08:25:57,820 --> 08:25:58,820
Oh no, what's wrong?

8936
08:26:00,820 --> 08:26:01,820
It's bad game.

8937
08:26:01,820 --> 08:26:02,820
It's bad game.

8938
08:26:05,820 --> 08:26:06,820
Get that steal,

8939
08:26:06,820 --> 08:26:07,820
but yeah,

8940
08:26:07,820 --> 08:26:08,820
I think it's kind of drop in,

8941
08:26:08,820 --> 08:26:09,820
drop out.

8942
08:26:10,820 --> 08:26:11,820
Um,

8943
08:26:11,820 --> 08:26:13,820
I would like to play among us

8944
08:26:13,820 --> 08:26:14,820
so I can start screaming at you,

8945
08:26:14,820 --> 08:26:15,820
and I'll be like,

8946
08:26:15,820 --> 08:26:16,820
it's red, it's red,

8947
08:26:16,820 --> 08:26:17,820
wreathlings,

8948
08:26:17,820 --> 08:26:18,820
you don't believe me,

8949
08:26:18,820 --> 08:26:19,820
it's red.

8950
08:26:22,820 --> 08:26:23,820
But we'll have to,

8951
08:26:23,820 --> 08:26:25,820
we'll have to try it

8952
08:26:25,820 --> 08:26:26,820
and see what happens.

8953
08:26:31,820 --> 08:26:32,820
Okay, I'm done.

8954
08:26:33,820 --> 08:26:34,820
I'm so, I'm so emoji.

8955
08:26:34,820 --> 08:26:35,820
Look at me like,

8956
08:26:35,820 --> 08:26:36,820
I'm literally hovering

8957
08:26:36,820 --> 08:26:37,820
ready for the trade offer.

8958
08:26:37,820 --> 08:26:38,820
Like, yeah, yeah,

8959
08:26:38,820 --> 08:26:39,820
give me the trade offer.

8960
08:26:39,820 --> 08:26:40,820
Oh, look, your problem now.

8961
08:26:40,820 --> 08:26:41,820
There you go.

8962
08:26:41,820 --> 08:26:42,820
Oh, your problem now.

8963
08:26:45,820 --> 08:26:46,820
There you go.

8964
08:26:46,820 --> 08:26:47,820
Oh, yours golden rings yours.

8965
08:26:47,820 --> 08:26:48,820
Thank you for all the lobsters.

8966
08:26:52,820 --> 08:26:53,820
Among us.

8967
08:26:55,820 --> 08:26:57,820
You've never played among us?

8968
08:26:57,820 --> 08:26:59,820
Deep Rock Galactica.

8969
08:26:59,820 --> 08:27:01,820
We can play Deep Rock together.

8970
08:27:02,820 --> 08:27:03,820
Can I force you guys

8971
08:27:03,820 --> 08:27:05,820
to play that Mains of Moria game with me?

8972
08:27:07,820 --> 08:27:09,820
I'm too scared to ask the girls to play

8973
08:27:09,820 --> 08:27:11,820
in case they absolutely despise it.

8974
08:27:11,820 --> 08:27:12,820
So,

8975
08:27:12,820 --> 08:27:14,820
although I may be able to convince Sheebie.

8976
08:27:17,820 --> 08:27:19,820
There's a Mains of Moria game.

8977
08:27:19,820 --> 08:27:20,820
It's like,

8978
08:27:20,820 --> 08:27:22,820
it's literally Deep Rock Galactica,

8979
08:27:22,820 --> 08:27:23,820
but Lord of the Rings,

8980
08:27:23,820 --> 08:27:24,820
Quidditch.

8981
08:27:25,820 --> 08:27:26,820
You want to try Warframe.

8982
08:27:26,820 --> 08:27:28,820
It's freeing up to four man squads.

8983
08:27:28,820 --> 08:27:29,820
Ooh.

8984
08:27:31,820 --> 08:27:32,820
I think you can force us

8985
08:27:32,820 --> 08:27:33,820
to do anything you want to try.

8986
08:27:40,820 --> 08:27:41,820
I haven't ever heard of it.

8987
08:27:41,820 --> 08:27:42,820
I've never got advertised well.

8988
08:27:42,820 --> 08:27:44,820
The only reason I've popped up for me

8989
08:27:44,820 --> 08:27:46,820
is because I'm on Lord of the Rings

8990
08:27:46,820 --> 08:27:47,820
side of TikTok.

8991
08:27:48,820 --> 08:27:50,820
So, if there's anything Lord of the Rings,

8992
08:27:50,820 --> 08:27:52,820
Lord of the Rings related.

8993
08:27:53,820 --> 08:27:54,820
Oh my God, we're going to level up.

8994
08:27:55,820 --> 08:27:58,820
40 freakin' seven.

8995
08:27:59,820 --> 08:28:00,820
Oh my gosh.

8996
08:28:02,820 --> 08:28:03,820
This is getting

8997
08:28:03,820 --> 08:28:04,820
insane.

8998
08:28:06,820 --> 08:28:07,820
Oh crap.

8999
08:28:09,820 --> 08:28:10,820
Thank you.

9000
08:28:10,820 --> 08:28:11,820
Thank you, Reflings.

9001
08:28:12,820 --> 08:28:13,820
I appreciate it.

9002
08:28:13,820 --> 08:28:14,820
Literally everyone feeding me.

9003
08:28:14,820 --> 08:28:15,820
We're all like,

9004
08:28:15,820 --> 08:28:16,820
fishing away, leveling up and stuff.

9005
08:28:21,820 --> 08:28:23,820
I think we'll play

9006
08:28:23,820 --> 08:28:25,820
RuneScape during,

9007
08:28:26,820 --> 08:28:28,820
on the third week of streams,

9008
08:28:28,820 --> 08:28:31,820
I think we might do a double RuneScape

9009
08:28:31,820 --> 08:28:32,820
to make sure we really get there,

9010
08:28:32,820 --> 08:28:33,820
XP-wise.

9011
08:28:33,820 --> 08:28:35,820
I'll break it up in between the week

9012
08:28:35,820 --> 08:28:37,820
just so it's not like a full day of RuneScape

9013
08:28:37,820 --> 08:28:38,820
and then one right after it.

9014
08:28:38,820 --> 08:28:40,820
Because I know RuneScape isn't for everyone.

9015
08:28:40,820 --> 08:28:42,820
I know it might be a bit

9016
08:28:42,820 --> 08:28:44,820
of a snooze fest,

9017
08:28:44,820 --> 08:28:46,820
but for me it's so satisfying.

9018
08:28:46,820 --> 08:28:48,820
Like, bigger number?

9019
08:28:49,820 --> 08:28:50,820
Bigger number?

9020
08:28:50,820 --> 08:28:51,820
Big number.

9021
08:28:51,820 --> 08:28:52,820
Big number.

9022
08:28:52,820 --> 08:28:55,820
Like, it's like really good for me.

9023
08:28:55,820 --> 08:28:57,820
But I guess maybe watching it

9024
08:28:57,820 --> 08:28:58,820
it might be better,

9025
08:28:58,820 --> 08:28:59,820
like if it was a compilation

9026
08:28:59,820 --> 08:29:01,820
or like a highlight, you know.

9027
08:29:02,820 --> 08:29:03,820
Still do Warframe.

9028
08:29:03,820 --> 08:29:05,820
It's the worst game to be a new player

9029
08:29:05,820 --> 08:29:06,820
and 100% confusing

9030
08:29:06,820 --> 08:29:07,820
and there's a neat tutorial.

9031
08:29:07,820 --> 08:29:09,820
Deep Rock Season 5 is a bit

9032
08:29:09,820 --> 08:29:10,820
of a horror show right now.

9033
08:29:11,820 --> 08:29:12,820
What is it?

9034
08:29:15,820 --> 08:29:16,820
Number go up.

9035
08:29:19,820 --> 08:29:21,820
RuneScape is definitely a talking stream,

9036
08:29:21,820 --> 08:29:23,820
like a datzu, like back and forth.

9037
08:29:23,820 --> 08:29:25,820
I like meme-ing with one of each other.

9038
08:29:26,820 --> 08:29:28,820
I'm like learning about the game and stuff.

9039
08:29:30,820 --> 08:29:32,820
I don't know enough about RuneScape.

9040
08:29:32,820 --> 08:29:34,820
Literally, I was in kindergarten when I said

9041
08:29:34,820 --> 08:29:37,820
the best I did as a kid was do cooking

9042
08:29:37,820 --> 08:29:39,820
and then probably do 40

9043
08:29:39,820 --> 08:29:40,820
and then that's the best.

9044
08:29:40,820 --> 08:29:42,820
I actually don't know how the game works.

9045
08:29:43,820 --> 08:29:45,820
So much lobster.

9046
08:29:45,820 --> 08:29:46,820
Rock lobster.

9047
08:29:51,820 --> 08:29:53,820
Nuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

9048
08:29:58,820 --> 08:30:00,820
Uh, b52 is anyone?

9049
08:30:04,820 --> 08:30:07,820
The Reflane is,

9050
08:30:07,820 --> 08:30:09,820
could you trouble you to play

9051
08:30:09,820 --> 08:30:11,820
Voices of the Void?

9052
08:30:11,820 --> 08:30:12,820
I don't know what that is.

9053
08:30:12,820 --> 08:30:13,820
Is it an MMO?

9054
08:30:13,820 --> 08:30:15,820
Or like single?

9055
08:30:16,820 --> 08:30:17,820
Or what?

9056
08:30:17,820 --> 08:30:18,820
What kind of game?

9057
08:30:18,820 --> 08:30:31,640
game. This review thing is a deep one. Final Fantasy 14. I was gonna give it a shot but

9058
08:30:31,640 --> 08:30:41,180
yeah. I never ended up playing it. I don't know if they say they roleplay a lot in it.

9059
08:30:41,180 --> 08:30:48,180
Honestly, I don't mind. It'll be fun to roleplay.

9060
08:30:48,180 --> 08:30:59,180
A roleplay is what though. I don't know what a roleplay is. I've had a choice to roleplay something.

9061
08:30:59,180 --> 08:31:18,180
I don't know. Save Heroes is free to play. Super hero animal. Oh, I think I said I wanted

9062
08:31:18,180 --> 08:31:26,620
to play Marvel Rivals. We might play that but I don't know if it's in beta or if that's

9063
08:31:26,620 --> 08:31:32,900
it fully out. I don't know. Oh, my tummy's wobbling. I don't know what to do.

9064
08:31:32,900 --> 08:31:40,860
Strony and her 100 husbands. Isn't this the life though? You know, you have to wait to

9065
08:31:40,860 --> 08:31:47,140
get your one-on-one attention but then that makes it so much more worth it. Why do I keep

9066
08:31:47,140 --> 08:31:56,740
fricking snail blinking? I'm gonna have to change that. Please stop blinking one at a time.

9067
08:31:56,740 --> 08:32:09,260
I'm gonna have to make the sensitivity different. Any trenches in trying Lord of the Rings online?

9068
08:32:09,260 --> 08:32:15,940
Like Shadow of the Rings online? You mean Elden Scrolls online? Or is there like a Lord

9069
08:32:15,940 --> 08:32:23,340
of the Rings online I have no idea about? I'm actually playing Final Fantasy while watching

9070
08:32:23,340 --> 08:32:30,060
the stream. Speaking of fact, cannot decide. I work in accounting and I'm the only guy

9071
08:32:30,060 --> 08:32:35,780
with nine girls in the office. Hey, what a ladies man. Check it out. You get a nice view

9072
08:32:35,780 --> 08:32:43,820
all day long. There's a Lord of the Rings. Maybe I've seen it and I'm just being a dum-dum.

9073
08:32:43,820 --> 08:32:54,220
I can't recall it off the toilet in the head. Should I move? I feel like I'm like in the

9074
08:32:54,220 --> 08:33:02,380
way here. Oh, I can't even access the fire. Oh, I can't even access the fire though. Dum-dum.

9075
08:33:02,380 --> 08:33:07,420
Oops, sorry. I'm already accepted. It's pretty old. Does Lord of the Rings online still even

9076
08:33:07,420 --> 08:33:13,300
have server? Yeah, I don't even think I've seen any gameplay of it. Unless I have in

9077
08:33:13,420 --> 08:33:19,460
my brains just not putting them two together. 171 successful cooks to go. Not sure how many

9078
08:33:19,460 --> 08:33:28,420
could in burnings, so probably ten more traps. Wow. We're at 81,000 XP on cooking. We need

9079
08:33:28,420 --> 08:33:41,500
20k more when it's mercy. 20 minutes on mercy. I don't know. If we could stop burning. There's

9080
08:33:41,580 --> 08:33:45,260
no way you're still headbanging over there. Are you not tired of clicking the button?

9081
08:33:48,060 --> 08:33:53,100
Brightly Lord of the Rings is microtransaction to heck. Okay, that's probably why I haven't

9082
08:33:53,100 --> 08:34:00,140
heard about it because everyone just saw how much of a grab it was. I lost my little face. Yeah,

9083
08:34:00,140 --> 08:34:08,460
maybe I am. Maybe I'm just headbanging. I mean, barbed village is a thing. Yeah, we might maybe

9084
08:34:08,460 --> 08:34:20,540
do a watch along of stuff for the later levels. Oh, 48, man. That's so good. Literally, I was aiming

9085
08:34:20,540 --> 08:34:26,140
for 40, and I'm so happy with what we've got. Obviously, special shout out to the reflins who

9086
08:34:26,140 --> 08:34:32,700
are supplying a ridiculous amount of money and fish and everything to me because it is insane.

9087
08:34:32,700 --> 08:34:39,660
And literally, the reflins down here that are just chilling and fishing away, they're just having

9088
08:34:39,660 --> 08:34:45,740
a good time leveling up fishing. What are your fishing levels? Hold on, let me type. Fishing

9089
08:34:45,740 --> 08:34:56,700
level check. Fishing level check. I'm still struggling early game fishing and cooking

9090
08:34:56,700 --> 08:35:02,540
so the lumberjoo shrimp, it takes forever to net some shrimp and then you burn them to heck.

9091
08:35:03,100 --> 08:35:07,340
If you guys want to catch up to her, I'll give you what I have left after stream.

9092
08:35:10,140 --> 08:35:17,740
Out of curiosity, are you avoiding profanity for any reason? A little bit. The AI can tell,

9093
08:35:17,740 --> 08:35:23,100
like the AI can read what my voice is, so I kind of try and swap out words over time

9094
08:35:23,660 --> 08:35:29,980
because I am quite outrageous at certain sections, so I try and tone it down as long

9095
08:35:29,980 --> 08:35:36,700
as you get a good 80-20 mix, then overall you're fine, which is why I swap out words sometimes.

9096
08:35:39,340 --> 08:35:42,220
I have enough eggs to be for night night twice, unfortunately.

9097
08:35:42,540 --> 08:35:49,820
A little refling's cute surprise of the stream. Oh, we keep burning them.

9098
08:35:52,940 --> 08:35:59,180
Oh lobbies, you're not as easy to cook as I thought. My little, my caviar.

9099
08:35:59,180 --> 08:36:12,860
But yes, I maybe need to think of, like, maybe we watch movies whilst we runescape

9100
08:36:12,860 --> 08:36:16,940
in the background or something. I mean, I can do a set of watch one movie,

9101
08:36:18,140 --> 08:36:22,780
obviously I can't show it, but I can show the timer so as we jump in at any point.

9102
08:36:23,340 --> 08:36:25,980
Maybe Harry Potter, do you guys like Harry Potter?

9103
08:36:28,620 --> 08:36:36,060
I've watched it through for the first time, a couple years back, I've not seen the full thing.

9104
08:36:36,060 --> 08:36:39,580
Not particularly, okay, maybe not, sorry, sorry, maybe not, maybe it's a girl's movie. Apologies.

9105
08:36:41,580 --> 08:36:48,780
Is there a C- John Wick series? We'll watch the John Wick series movies, that would be a good one.

9106
08:36:49,340 --> 08:36:57,580
I think everyone who's ready for RuneScape and Chill, honestly, John Wick RuneScape and Chill,

9107
08:36:58,780 --> 08:37:03,260
I'll put down the sound of the game like really low and we'll just watch the movie.

9108
08:37:03,260 --> 08:37:08,300
And it's just me going, in the movie, and then every time I level up I also go,

9109
08:37:11,180 --> 08:37:14,460
the first three movies of Harry Potter is pretty comfortable. Yeah, I guess really

9110
08:37:14,540 --> 08:37:19,500
dark at the end, which I don't. You could do a pool on which movies, yeah.

9111
08:37:21,660 --> 08:37:28,860
Just because of how long, like the grains are, I would kind of want to do series movies and

9112
08:37:32,620 --> 08:37:37,420
John Wick has three installments, I'm pretty sure, which is why I quite like that.

9113
08:37:38,380 --> 08:37:49,180
What about Shrek? Oh, I don't like the later Shrek. Is it Shrek happily ever after?

9114
08:37:55,020 --> 08:37:56,140
John Wick has four?

9115
08:37:59,580 --> 08:38:04,140
Have I seen the fourth one? I might know you haven't seen the fourth one. I don't know,

9116
08:38:04,140 --> 08:38:13,580
there's a fourth installment. Huh. I have a silly idea. What's your idea? Hmm, you have me curious.

9117
08:38:13,580 --> 08:38:19,340
Speak your truth. Stroney, how do you feel about Spider-Man movies? You want to watch the original

9118
08:38:19,340 --> 08:38:25,820
Spider-Man? Like the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man? So we can all have a gig a lot of the dancing.

9119
08:38:26,780 --> 08:38:35,100
Hmm. Tobey Maguire is a must, I don't know. I remember like a freaking babbling and watching the

9120
08:38:35,100 --> 08:38:42,940
movies practically. Yeah, the fourth, the final chapter is the fourth. Okay, okay, okay.

9121
08:38:45,420 --> 08:38:49,980
Stroney, did you know that Lord of the Rings trilogy lasts less than one of your endurance

9122
08:38:50,060 --> 08:38:56,060
streams? I'm saving myself. I'm saving myself for the Lord of the Rings on Christmas Day.

9123
08:38:56,620 --> 08:39:04,780
I am abstaining from such beautiful literature, such beautiful media that was created for human

9124
08:39:04,780 --> 08:39:18,220
consumption. So we're not going to watch them for this. The Sam Remy trilogy. Yes, Spider-Man 3.

9125
08:39:19,020 --> 08:39:23,900
I don't think I saw that one. I didn't see any of the Spider-Man's that have Emma Stone in it.

9126
08:39:27,180 --> 08:39:32,220
But I watched Spider-Man. We're all three of them were in the same movie.

9127
08:39:34,380 --> 08:39:39,020
And Tobey was like, yeah, it just comes out of my wrist. And the other two were like, huh?

9128
08:39:40,300 --> 08:39:45,980
Because I couldn't believe it. Because I think the new, oh, I'm really bad with people's names.

9129
08:39:45,980 --> 08:39:51,020
The new Spider-Man has to use nanotechnology from Iron Man to get his gunk out.

9130
08:39:53,340 --> 08:39:59,900
I don't know what Garth feels. Honestly, any of the Spider-Man movies, the movies are great. Okay.

9131
08:40:01,660 --> 08:40:11,260
49. Oh my gosh, 49 just popped. Feels good, man. Tom Holland. Ah, his name's Tom Holland.

9132
08:40:16,940 --> 08:40:21,740
I sing the praises of the apocrity diary for anyone who wants them. Is it a movie?

9133
08:40:23,260 --> 08:40:28,460
I'm not heard of it. Is it a game or a movie?

9134
08:40:33,740 --> 08:40:41,900
Oh, my tummy's so hungry. But I can't make food. I must grind. I must fish max. We are fish maxing.

9135
08:40:42,540 --> 08:40:52,860
We hitting 50 before Mercy. Before, I think so. We are like blasting through these levels. It's crazy.

9136
08:40:55,180 --> 08:41:05,020
0.7% of the weight of 99. Let's go. Oh, I read apocrity novel. Aren't there like seven Highlander

9137
08:41:05,020 --> 08:41:16,700
movies? It's Mad Max, a one-off movie. I think so. That new Mad Max, I think is good. The one that

9138
08:41:16,700 --> 08:41:24,860
was like, witness me, and he put spray can on his teeth. That one was pretty good. Those one-off

9139
08:41:24,860 --> 08:41:30,460
movies are... Oh, sorry. I just clicked. I misclicked. Oh, sorry, sorry. The grind. The grind, please.

9140
08:41:30,460 --> 08:41:35,420
The lobster maxing. I can't do it if I'm not misclicking. It was a misinput, misinput.

9141
08:41:36,460 --> 08:41:43,740
Fury Road was one. XP waste. No, don't bully me over my XP wasting.

9142
08:41:46,060 --> 08:41:52,700
It says I need 54 cooks, and I've got level 50. If I can stop burning them, maybe two more

9143
08:41:52,700 --> 08:41:57,820
inventories of lobbies. Oh, maybe two. We can do it in two.

9144
08:42:01,740 --> 08:42:10,860
Where are... If only I knew how many hours I spent bank standing. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

9145
08:42:13,340 --> 08:42:19,420
I think your ping may be blessed, possibly. Get that fire on. Get that fire on. Get that lobby on the

9146
08:42:19,420 --> 08:42:27,900
fire. Not the misinput. Blade Runner? Ooh, that's a good suggestion.

9147
08:42:31,660 --> 08:42:39,020
I thought about because of the Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling. I don't know why that was so hard to

9148
08:42:39,020 --> 08:42:44,380
say Ryan. Because of the Ryan Gosling movies, I thought it would be funny if we did like a six

9149
08:42:44,460 --> 08:42:50,860
girl watch along of it, like all six of us watching it. And then whenever Ryan comes on screen,

9150
08:42:50,860 --> 08:42:55,340
all of us can be like, oh, that's literally my refling. That's literally my like,

9151
08:42:55,340 --> 08:42:58,700
bleeding heart. That's literally my snippet. That's literally my pinpal.

9152
08:43:02,860 --> 08:43:10,780
I'm on world 380 at Barbarian Village. Unfortunately, I'm literally about to go off in 13 minutes.

9153
08:43:11,100 --> 08:43:16,700
Because Mercy's coming online. And literally, oh my god, that's my refling. Oh my god, my refling's

9154
08:43:16,700 --> 08:43:20,780
so strong. I'm gonna just be like complimenting you the entire stream.

9155
08:43:25,180 --> 08:43:29,900
Okay, it says 34 more lobsters. Okay, this time, two more inventories. I'll do it.

9156
08:43:30,460 --> 08:43:32,540
Can't stop burning these lobbies.

9157
08:43:33,100 --> 08:43:33,900
Wow.

9158
08:43:37,980 --> 08:43:43,900
That Gosling, literally. I wouldn't mind rewatching The Blade Runner because I didn't like fully

9159
08:43:43,900 --> 08:43:52,940
comprehend it at first. So it'd be nice to like see it again, kind of mildly knowing what happens.

9160
08:43:53,580 --> 08:43:59,180
Have you watched Seven Cycle Path? Movie before? No, I haven't. I'm not sure what that is. That

9161
08:43:59,180 --> 08:44:07,580
Gosling, literally. Can't wait to see us all together again. Can't wait as well.

9162
08:44:07,580 --> 08:44:11,580
We've got our first group collab, and then we've got our one-on-one collab coming out soon again.

9163
08:44:14,940 --> 08:44:18,700
So I'm gonna see. Can I please stop burning these lobbies, please?

9164
08:44:30,140 --> 08:44:38,140
I think I can do it. But yes. I think I said a little bit before, we're a little bit limited

9165
08:44:38,140 --> 08:44:43,740
on multiplayer games that we can all play together, so I think I will encourage like some

9166
08:44:43,740 --> 08:44:56,860
trio collabs or quad man collabs at some point, but it'll be fun to see everyone's like dynamic

9167
08:44:56,940 --> 08:45:00,060
with each other. I hope no one's scared of me.

9168
08:45:00,860 --> 08:45:08,620
Strawny smells, how dare you? How do your accusations? I smell like burnt lobster, burnt

9169
08:45:08,620 --> 08:45:16,140
shrimp, burnt trout, burnt salmon, burnt pike. I smell like burnt everything because I can't stop

9170
08:45:16,140 --> 08:45:22,620
freaking messing up. I need to kick 13 lobsters in the snatch and I level up, and I burn three in a

9171
08:45:22,620 --> 08:45:31,340
row, of course, when I say that. Four in a row! That's more like it. Trying to upset me video game,

9172
08:45:32,460 --> 08:45:37,020
it's working. I saw the fish she's handling, so sniff the stuff.

9173
08:45:39,100 --> 08:45:44,140
Looking forward to main crash shenanigans. Yeah, that's in July. July shenanigans.

9174
08:45:45,100 --> 08:45:53,180
I'm not beating the front end. Eating Strawny's burnt food sign me up. Oh, no, those are carcinogenic.

9175
08:45:53,180 --> 08:46:00,380
You're not supposed to eat burnt any kind of food. Wait, why did she smell like fish? We're the ones

9176
08:46:00,380 --> 08:46:09,660
who are questioning. We did it! We're 50! We actually did it, no way. Mercy's up in 10.

9177
08:46:10,620 --> 08:46:19,340
No, we've got 50. That's insane. Thank you so much, we've got 50.

9178
08:46:23,260 --> 08:46:27,420
And that was like messing about questing as well and all that.

9179
08:46:28,060 --> 08:46:40,300
I look forward to less burning. M-A-B-Zoo, congrats. Honestly, I hope I'll stop burning.

9180
08:46:40,300 --> 08:46:52,620
Oh my god, I'm so MLG pro at cutting fish. Ah! I'll send the crunch.

9181
08:46:53,260 --> 08:46:57,820
It says the value is 2.3k for that batch of lobsters?

9182
08:46:59,900 --> 08:47:01,900
I thought lobsters were a money maker.

9183
08:47:06,060 --> 08:47:13,500
Okay, well, I hope to see you play old school again. Yeah, we'll play it once next week on week two

9184
08:47:13,500 --> 08:47:20,220
and then we'll play it twice on week three during the week, but I'll split it up just in case

9185
08:47:20,220 --> 08:47:25,420
because I don't know. RuneScape isn't the most interesting. Not anymore with all the bots.

9186
08:47:28,140 --> 08:47:33,820
Maybe the bots aren't so bad after all. Controversion. You can't say that. You can't say that.

9187
08:47:36,060 --> 08:47:39,020
They wear a really long time ago. I'm wondering if that's what I remember.

9188
08:47:41,740 --> 08:47:48,860
Bots keep the lobsters cheap. I'm wondering how the economy in RuneScape would look

9189
08:47:48,940 --> 08:47:56,380
if bots were like completely forbidden, like if they managed to like completely eradicate them.

9190
08:47:57,900 --> 08:48:02,940
I'm wondering if it would be an uproar because everything would get so expensive, you know?

9191
08:48:05,260 --> 08:48:06,620
Curious, curious.

9192
08:48:12,700 --> 08:48:14,380
We're learning, we're learning.

9193
08:48:15,340 --> 08:48:20,220
Stony, Iron Man win. Oh, good luck with that. Are you joking?

9194
08:48:22,220 --> 08:48:29,980
It's hardcore Iron Man. You can't use bank. Iron Man is what? You lose everything when you perish?

9195
08:48:32,220 --> 08:48:36,380
Sorry, I'm probably standing on everyone right now.

9196
08:48:37,100 --> 08:48:46,940
I feel like it would probably like been working on a mech and AC6 for whatever you get on it.

9197
08:48:49,660 --> 08:48:52,940
Ultimate Iron Man, no bank, hardcore, lose stats when that. Yeah.

9198
08:48:56,060 --> 08:49:04,620
Are you serious? Do you know how much money I've made today? That's 20 million. No way I've been

9199
08:49:04,620 --> 08:49:15,900
given 20 million. Hello? Don't people like spend like actual real-world currency to get this kind

9200
08:49:15,900 --> 08:49:22,220
of going? Gold and coin together is going just like you should know. I'm putting this in the bank.

9201
08:49:22,220 --> 08:49:27,020
Wait, you said there was a bank up here. Hold on. Hold on, mommy's going to the bank. She'll be back

9202
08:49:27,020 --> 08:49:32,140
in a second. There's a bank up here? Is that one of these buildings? That looks like a ruined building.

9203
08:49:34,860 --> 08:49:38,220
Oh, I'm getting scared. I hope I don't get attacked. You have what level are you people?

9204
08:49:38,860 --> 08:49:45,420
Identify yourselves. Okay, no, I must be off of it. Oh, wait, wait, I see banker booth. We found it.

9205
08:49:46,300 --> 08:49:49,660
We're finally in Edgeville. This is where I was born.

9206
08:49:51,980 --> 08:49:56,540
Right, let's get this money nice and safe and tidy in here because oh my gosh.

9207
08:49:57,500 --> 08:50:01,500
Hey, leather gloves. Can I put that on? Is that going to like add to my defense?

9208
08:50:02,140 --> 08:50:08,620
Oh my gosh, leather gloves. That's what I needed. Oh, I'll check it out. Oh my god, I'm starting.

9209
08:50:10,860 --> 08:50:15,020
Whoa, that's right. Whoa, the bend of my arm is amazing.

9210
08:50:19,100 --> 08:50:24,460
We did it. We did it. All right, let me come back briefly. No, don't cry. Don't cry. Look over and

9211
08:50:24,460 --> 08:50:29,340
you're crying. No, don't cry. I'm right here. I'm just stunning on the bank because I'm really scared.

9212
08:50:30,300 --> 08:50:34,060
I didn't even know there was a freaking thing up there. Well, now I know there's a bank up there.

9213
08:50:34,060 --> 08:50:42,300
I am expanding my runescape knowledge. Wow, okay, okay, we're here. I think I might need to...

9214
08:50:44,860 --> 08:50:49,180
Can I get level 51? Whoa, wait a minute. Can I even cook these?

9215
08:50:51,660 --> 08:50:53,020
Can I cook swordfish?

9216
08:50:53,020 --> 08:51:01,580
Oh, I can. What did they get? Oh, burnt it. 140.

9217
08:51:04,140 --> 08:51:07,660
It says I have to cook 56 swordfish to already level up again.

9218
08:51:08,620 --> 08:51:14,780
Wait, it's taking down two? It's just 50. It's literally going down by two. 48.

9219
08:51:15,180 --> 08:51:26,540
47. Wait, what? I'm going crazy. Is that a chef hat? It is. It's a golden chef hat and a golden apron.

9220
08:51:26,540 --> 08:51:28,540
A refling literally gave me it.

9221
08:51:34,300 --> 08:51:35,580
Oh, I just started doing something.

9222
08:51:37,980 --> 08:51:42,140
You should be able to buy enough materials for 99 cooking with five million coins alone.

9223
08:51:42,700 --> 08:51:47,260
I've got, well, I've got 20. We might as well go fletching while we're at it. Will we do crafting?

9224
08:51:49,020 --> 08:51:52,780
Jeez. Not me becoming a runescape player overnight.

9225
08:51:54,940 --> 08:52:01,900
Like a runescape skillar, sorry. Oh my goodness, that swordfish is insane.

9226
08:52:01,900 --> 08:52:07,660
We're at 31. Yeah, it's like recalculating, as you guys see. It's trying to do the math, but oof.

9227
08:52:07,820 --> 08:52:09,820
That's insane.

9228
08:52:12,140 --> 08:52:16,140
How much is it on the ground? For swordfish, it's 4k for that lot.

9229
08:52:16,700 --> 08:52:18,700
It just seems like a shame that I'm kind of wasting that vote.

9230
08:52:20,060 --> 08:52:24,460
Oh, even more. Goodbye, those who have to go.

9231
08:52:25,500 --> 08:52:30,780
Yes, please don't worry if you have to go now. I'm about to read in some mercy to give myself a

9232
08:52:30,780 --> 08:52:37,020
vocal rest before I do ASMR, I believe, tomorrow. And then it's the sweet stream.

9233
08:52:37,900 --> 08:52:42,780
Yes. So please don't worry if you have to go. I'm literally just cooking away

9234
08:52:44,300 --> 08:52:49,820
an experience in swordfish XT. I sent for Scottish anime women.

9235
08:52:51,900 --> 08:52:54,860
Thanks for something for me. I sent for replays.

9236
08:52:57,100 --> 08:53:03,900
Unfathomable progress, honestly. Oh yeah, buy out those stats. Yeah, we're going to get it.

9237
08:53:08,300 --> 08:53:14,060
Rest well, rest well. I also shrimped for her. Oh yeah, you shrimped for me because I'm a

9238
08:53:14,060 --> 08:53:19,900
mesipish. I'm a sea animal, so you shrimped for me. And we're head banging away.

9239
08:53:28,540 --> 08:53:33,740
I'll wait the ride. I'll ask Mercy to put bad jokes written all over your new clothes design.

9240
08:53:33,740 --> 08:53:37,660
I'm so curious what she comes up with, like so, so curious.

9241
08:53:39,740 --> 08:53:48,300
Oh my god, we're 110 KXP for cooking. That's just amazing.

9242
08:53:51,820 --> 08:53:55,180
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. And there's more where it came from.

9243
08:53:55,660 --> 08:54:01,500
Not going to lie, I'd be part of that army if I played RuneScape at all.

9244
08:54:03,100 --> 08:54:07,580
Someone was like, oh yeah, start up a guild. And I'm like, I've never done it. I don't even know how to do it.

9245
08:54:09,580 --> 08:54:15,340
Well, we'll just play as free agents, if you will. We're free agents. Free refling.

9246
08:54:15,820 --> 08:54:23,580
We sent for each other a circling of scents, if you will.

9247
08:54:24,940 --> 08:54:29,740
Shrimping hard. The amount of progress is only possible with an army of shrimps.

9248
08:54:30,540 --> 08:54:34,780
My little shrimpers. Oh fine, I guess you are my little shrimpers.

9249
08:54:35,580 --> 08:54:43,900
Don't guild members get XP boosts, do they? What for, like, raids?

9250
08:54:46,060 --> 08:54:50,860
Like streams to help Algo. Watch Mercy and RuneScape schedule. Yeah!

9251
08:54:53,340 --> 08:55:01,180
51 on day one, 51. That is an insane progress.

9252
08:55:01,500 --> 08:55:07,900
Insane. Day one, level 51.

9253
08:55:07,900 --> 08:55:11,420
Bruh. Bruh. Bruh.

9254
08:55:13,260 --> 08:55:18,220
And that's with doing, like, free quests and stuff together.

9255
08:55:19,500 --> 08:55:23,820
I'm wondering if we, like, just, just, just, just, just sent it.

9256
08:55:24,780 --> 08:55:26,380
But we just sent it.

9257
08:55:27,740 --> 08:55:30,140
Wait, you're both doing swordfish as well?

9258
08:55:31,980 --> 08:55:35,740
You guys said, nah, lobbies isn't enough. We've had enough of lobsters.

9259
08:55:35,740 --> 08:55:39,020
You're gonna, you're gonna just sell them on? You're gonna sell them back into the,

9260
08:55:39,020 --> 08:55:40,620
the grand exchange economy?

9261
08:55:44,780 --> 08:55:49,500
We don't need sleep when we have, oh, I hope you guys are sleeping well. We got you, literally.

9262
08:55:50,460 --> 08:55:53,740
I hope you guys are sleeping well. I've had a few days without sleeping.

9263
08:55:53,740 --> 08:55:55,340
Okay, it's rough. I guess it's dangerous.

9264
08:55:57,980 --> 08:55:58,780
Hydration check.

9265
08:56:02,060 --> 08:56:04,540
It's 1pm. Uh, is Mercy on?

9266
08:56:06,300 --> 08:56:08,940
Wait, hold on. I'm gonna need to make sure I'm redirecting.

9267
08:56:10,380 --> 08:56:12,700
Hold on, Strony. Oh, no, no, no.

9268
08:56:13,340 --> 08:56:16,620
No, Mercy. No, this future channel, I need the link.

9269
08:56:20,860 --> 08:56:23,820
Nope, that was her yesterday stream. Don't be silly, Billy.

9270
08:56:25,740 --> 08:56:30,300
What? Oh, she's not live yet. It's like, upcoming. Oh, don't wait, 100 and 0.

9271
08:56:30,940 --> 08:56:31,420
Oh wait, I'll wait in.

9272
08:56:35,180 --> 08:56:37,980
She's, I'll wait until she's live to confirm the redirect.

9273
08:56:42,700 --> 08:56:50,080
I'll wait until she's live to put the oh she's literally just went live no way

9274
08:56:51,680 --> 08:56:57,680
That was so that's such good timing hold on let me let's do it. What if we just kept cooking

9275
08:56:59,480 --> 08:57:01,480
I don't know

9276
08:57:06,440 --> 08:57:08,440
I don't know

9277
08:57:08,800 --> 08:57:12,240
My voice is scoffed like it's scoffed the unbelief I can't

9278
08:57:15,240 --> 08:57:17,240
I kind of want to rest for days more

9279
08:57:18,440 --> 08:57:22,720
Is there going to be any scripts? Are you doing freestyle? I might do some scripted stuff

9280
08:57:23,520 --> 08:57:25,520
like at the start or like

9281
08:57:26,160 --> 08:57:28,160
freezes or certainly paragraphs

9282
08:57:28,840 --> 08:57:30,120
and

9283
08:57:30,120 --> 08:57:34,040
This woman needs to rest her voice don't encourage her bad habits Lamal

9284
08:57:34,680 --> 08:57:38,160
Right, let me make sure I'm redirecting into the stream

9285
08:57:38,640 --> 08:57:47,100
No, I'm going to make the big boy decision and rest my voice as much as it pains me

9286
08:57:48,560 --> 08:57:52,800
Because I do want it lobster. It's sorry. I want a swordfish max

9287
08:57:57,080 --> 08:57:59,080
Okay

9288
08:58:03,280 --> 08:58:06,800
Okay, she's still loading so I have stalling time okay

9289
08:58:07,800 --> 08:58:11,160
She's still loading in the loading screen so I can still

9290
08:58:13,400 --> 08:58:15,400
They'll never know

9291
08:58:16,280 --> 08:58:22,000
They'll never know we're gonna just want more just one more inventory of fish. Okay, just one more one more, please

08:58:28,120 --> 08:58:30,120
Please come on my knees

Just one more inventory though

9296
08:58:32,560 --> 08:58:36,900
We'll see how much xp we can get I'll be beautiful. I mean won't be so close to 52

9297
08:58:42,900 --> 08:58:47,240
Are you gonna do the M&M goodbye, what's the M&M goodbye?

9298
08:58:50,560 --> 08:58:53,800
Well even Scottish M&M again M&M again

9299
08:58:54,320 --> 08:58:56,320
I

9300
08:58:56,640 --> 08:59:01,160
Starting to nod off to that fishing myself. He's a few more minutes of swordfish maximum

9301
08:59:01,160 --> 08:59:05,920
Just one more just one more inventory, please. I'm not addicted. I promise just one more inventory full of fishes

9302
08:59:06,760 --> 08:59:08,760
Let's do it

9303
08:59:09,600 --> 08:59:16,320
What's the M&M thing? A lot of burnt one. Look, I'm trying my best. Okay. It's hard to cook over the fire

9304
08:59:16,680 --> 08:59:21,880
There's so the wind keeps blowing in different directions and people keep moving around the fire

9305
08:59:21,880 --> 08:59:25,520
So the air flow isn't really doing it. Don't supply her addiction

9306
08:59:28,400 --> 08:59:35,640
Get rest or anyone that beautiful acts in the top form. Yes, I will warn and say that ASMR streams are a

9307
08:59:36,240 --> 08:59:38,240
lot shorter

9308
08:59:38,640 --> 08:59:41,320
But I'll definitely be looking at marshmallows

9309
08:59:41,320 --> 08:59:46,840
I'll definitely be looking at some scripted stuff and you can always submit what you want to say as well

9310
08:59:46,840 --> 08:59:49,840

09:00:27,440 --> 09:00:30,080
There's no harm in one more batch of swordfish

9318
09:00:37,960 --> 09:00:40,560

I haven't played it in a long time, but it's kind of fun doing the quest with everyone out there today

9389
09:06:33,640 --> 09:06:37,720
Oh, I'm so glad you managed to join in on the quest. We'll definitely do quest next time as well
