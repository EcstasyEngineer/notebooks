WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
my little reflex I added a denoiser filter but I don't know if that made this stream worse

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
hi reflex

00:29.000 --> 00:43.000
mommy's right here she just had to wake up late because I was I was being a mommy and I was having to do a lot of work

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
strong is life to buy some any need

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
hello hello my little reflex

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
sh sh sh sh it's okay

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
mommy's here

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
sh sh sh hello little baby

01:09.000 --> 01:27.000
I've put a little, um, a noise gate on the microphone, so hopefully the background noise isn't like the weight noise isn't too bad.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
I, um, they don't cope well without you know, I don't cope well without my reflex.

01:35.000 --> 01:50.000
I had to do some business last night, and there may or may not be a collab with another agency planned.

01:50.000 --> 02:02.000
Um, do I spoil it? Do you want me to spoil the surprise? Because only, you only know what the surprise is if you're in this chat right now.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Also, please do check emotes for those of you who are on the emotes here.

02:08.000 --> 02:18.000
I was able to add all 10 of my emotes, and I get to order 10 more, and I'm so excited to order the next batch of 10 emotes.

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
Um, I already have a few ideas, but yes, please.

02:26.000 --> 02:38.000
I will try to be as relaxed as I can, but the problem is, I get so excited talking to you.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
That basically, the ASMR goes out the window all the time, which is, there we go.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, there's your warning.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
Uh, we are not doing hypnosis, uh, unfortunately.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
Thank you very much, Nate Sterling, for becoming a free-fling member, dear.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Real dear. God, I need to change the name of that. It's like, so big.

03:04.000 --> 03:15.000
Long-toe-mo-win. Ah, you leave my long-toes out of them, disclaimer's single.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
But I'm going to try and be relaxing. Thank you, Jay, for becoming a member.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Thank you, Ken, Gwispy, for becoming a member.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
I know I've got my hypnosis background.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
I was originally going, ah, Brian.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Can you guys hear Brian?

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
Ah, Pachinka, thank you for the 5 gifted, hold on, let me get a stream of elements, oh.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
Anonymous, thank you for the tip.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
Wait. Anonymous is ice-tronning, hopefully your day is amazing.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
It's just gone started, and since I can't just start with my reef links, it's going great.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Brian is very quiet, yes.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
I didn't, I knew ASMR, so I turned Brian down, like, right away.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
I can maybe foam up a little bit, but...

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I have a quick question, how did you learn hypnosis?

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
I just observe. I want to get into it, but it's kind of intimidating.

04:28.000 --> 04:36.000
Literally, I just observe. I absolutely love going, like, deep into things I don't know about,

04:36.000 --> 04:45.000
and I've always had an interest in it, so I like to consume people's production, or whatever.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Zarian, ah, thank you for the 100.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Congrats on monetization years for some of that most, bro.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Zarian, that's a lot. Thank you.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Oh my god.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
100 dollar tip, that's crazy.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
100 centimeters, nah, that's not possible.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
But Pachinka, thank you for the 5 gifted.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
But yeah, I just really like challenging myself.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
I always have a fascination in trying to understand why people like certain things.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
I know that seems silly, but I do.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
I just enjoy it, like, as much as I might tease the prep bros or something like that.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I just find it fascinating, I honestly do.

05:41.000 --> 05:52.000
Like, what makes you, you know, what tickles your pickle is a challenge to me, and I accept it wholeheartedly.

05:55.000 --> 06:04.000
But yeah, Secret Subject is an excellent feature, but Secret Subject is such a sweet heart.

06:04.000 --> 06:14.000
She so willingly educates the masses about it, and like, I love that she doesn't like cakey bit or anything.

06:14.000 --> 06:24.000
But like, everything that I do right now, or produce, is because of observations I've made.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Mangope, thank you.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
She's learning from spells and empathizing.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It reminds me of someone.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah, Secret is fantastic.

06:38.000 --> 06:46.000
She's got a new feature, Bermuda, which is like a polygon design, like the older video games.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
And I was tempted to get one for myself when I'm playing Nintendo DS games, because the graphics,

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
we're going to be playing a game called Dragon Quest Senators of the Stars, guys.

07:00.000 --> 07:09.000
And obviously the graphics are Nintendo graphics, but I thought it would be cool if that model would match,

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
but I'd rather save the money and get it for the girls.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Like, I have very bad news for Shibi and Insura investors.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
They will be getting a toggle that covers them up.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
Me and Mercy did not upset...

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Congrats to those who got the memberships with their face.

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
Me and Mercy's chests don't upset YouTube.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Insura and Shibi's chests has upset YouTube.

07:46.000 --> 07:58.000
If you notice that A.C.'s trailer video has 30,000 views, that's because advertisement money was put into it.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
Everyone had the same amount of advertisement money, except me.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
I've never put the same amount on myself.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I actually don't think I've spent any on myself.

08:10.000 --> 08:21.000
But Insura and Shibi were denied at running predominantly due to their chests.

08:21.000 --> 08:28.000
Insura's ASMR short was denied, even though she's not doing a single thing wrong in it.

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
So sadly, at the moment, the girls are being very creative and doing a little thing.

08:37.000 --> 08:48.000
Yes, I will say to the girls, they are welcome to use their toggles when they think the situation calls for it.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
That's perfectly fine by me.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
Yes, even the shorts, the girls weren't allowed.

08:57.000 --> 09:09.000
Now that they're monetized, today, Mercy is doing her celebration, I believe.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
So please do let her entertain you.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm probably going to be lurking her monetization.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Our thing is live.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
AC is on Saturday.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Emmy, I don't know when Emmy wants to do it.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
I mean, you know what? I'm going to DM her right now.

09:35.000 --> 09:59.000
A-M-E-A-M-R-S just wanted to know when you plan, when you plan on doing your S-L-A-B-R-E-S-E on stream.

09:59.000 --> 10:11.000
Just so I know when to remember S-L-A-B-R-S-E live.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
And then I'll do a little, and before she's in the channel, and then I'll do a little head-butt.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Need a Mercedes.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
She's so going to know how to type that live, there's no way.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
Oh no, she's on mobile. She's on her phone, she can see.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
Oh my god, the key clicking was in my head when my headphones, sorry.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Emmy was watching AC, okay.

10:41.000 --> 10:53.000
Yes, Azura and Shibi, it is not lost on me that Azura and Shibi are waiting for monetization, and they both just happened to have the biggest boobs.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Feature for manager ASMR.

10:58.000 --> 11:12.000
It's, I do like the boring stuff, like the kind of monotonous stuff where it's like, oh you need to open up membership to your type thing, and you need to do this and that.

11:12.000 --> 11:26.000
Like, I try not to let the girls do that, because it's both stressful and it's both like, it takes time, and rather the girls focus on having fun at debut and all.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
And then they're, well they're second week now.

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
Not bad, I wasn't expecting it to sound so real. That's cause they're for ya.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
But they will get monetization nonetheless, right?

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Well, we're waiting on it.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
I think the AI detection is flagged to them, basically.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
So a human does need to review them, which takes longer.

11:58.000 --> 12:09.000
Let's just pray that we have like a weep that understands what an earth featuring is, cause if they get denied, I'm gonna be so...

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm gonna be raging, I'm not even gonna lie.

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
I don't think there's gonna be issues, I think the AI has just sent them on to...

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And... yeah.

12:25.000 --> 12:31.000
Someone says you own your own tag at Realtary For now, let's go!

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Weeps and YouTube headquarters, yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
They better...

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Did you like my ASMR yesterday? Oh my god, I was outrageous.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
I can't believe I even did that.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
I got my tools out, I bet you liked that, didn't ya?

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
I was juicy.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
I was pretty gay, great, but can you feel your teeth?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
What, cause I liked it so much.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
One of your friends had a Q&A, I wanted to send a message, but I was too scared to send one.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Hi Anna.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
Do they not see who sent them or do they see if you send a message in front of them?

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Thank you for the tip, Anna.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
I don't know if you heard that, cause Brian is so nice and quiet.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
Are marshmallow messages anonymous? Yes, that is why they are favoured by many.

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
One of my gen mates had a Q&A and you wanted to ask a question, but you were scared to send one.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
Do they see you send some or you know we do not see a single thing?

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
Information-wise, it's just a question.

13:58.000 --> 14:06.000
You can send them if you want, but... yeah.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
Do they not see you send them or do they see if you send the message in the past? No.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I can vouch right now and say no, I cannot tell.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Someone could send me three questions in a row and change their spelling.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
And I wouldn't know, so I'm looking confident here.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Hi Brian in the far distance.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
I left work early to watch you, but guys, I hope you're okay and you feel better soon.

14:35.000 --> 14:43.000
I like the measuring section. Now everyone knows I have long toes, what you can do about it.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
But yes, please, so can you tell, based on spelling.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Well, you don't have to worry about me when it comes to spelling.

14:51.000 --> 14:59.000
There's absolutely no way I can clock you other than if you send a...

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I recognise that girl.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Sitting on your feet again.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm Gollum sitting right now, so my feet are in front of me and pushed into the chair.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
She's learning the pattern. No, I cannot do that.

15:16.000 --> 15:26.000
I do, I'll let the girl talk about it, but there's one girl, a vealer, that does recognise text.

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
Monka Ace, I don't know how her brain does it, but yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
We were close to having a cats and ace workshop.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
You've got to see Kim Lee.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
And then I go, that's where we learned Kim Lee.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
How's your daughter?

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah, I'm going to get a doctor's appointment, something's not right.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Someone was like, you need to sue, and I was like, nah, it's just what happens.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
It's kind of a risk you accept, because it's a job shop.

16:00.000 --> 16:08.000
You can get like, sorry, I need to scratch my head, my head says sin, or my headset and then...

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
It's just the thing.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Watching you during my collab lecture.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm in your ears.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Look left, look right, I might be in the lecture audience right now.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
I know that's not how it works, but get educated, get educated.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Please do go to the doctor.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah, don't worry, I am.

16:27.000 --> 16:37.000
Someone sent me a marshmallow, and I was like, okay, you've convinced me, so don't worry, I've got a doctor's appointment coming up.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Someone says, very nice celebration.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
Sorry, I'm reading marshmallows.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm so, so sleepy, wifling.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
I was up solely, I've only had five hours sleep.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
I'm probably going to go back to sleep, but yeah.

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
I was planning all these fun things, and making a lot of progress.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
My ASMR series is about to start up.

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
My thank you for eggs subscriber series is about to start, and I have no idea what to edit first.

17:19.000 --> 17:25.000
My first thing was going to be ear licking, but that's not allowed anymore.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
And I did a pop rock ear licking, and that's not going to be allowed.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
So, I have no idea.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
I do have burping ASMR, I may make that.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
I have like thigh cupping, I have like sitting on the mic ASMR, like I sit on it over and over again.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
You're almost at 5K up here or not, you guys are showing too much support.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
Thank you Lord of Stars for becoming a member.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
But yeah, I do have like sitting on the mic ASMR, I was squatting so hard.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
I have like clapping without using my hands ASMR, so that's going to be interesting.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
But I'll probably edit all that stuff, you heard her hit 5K right now.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Stop being so amazing and perfect then.

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
Too much support, literally, but like, don't be, get subscribed, get subscribed, get subscribed.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
So many ASMRs, yes, I have a long day to think of it.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Clapping without using your hands, oh yeah.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
But Jane, thank you for the day.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
No matter what you do for ASMR, I will enjoy you, even the burp ASMR.

18:48.000 --> 18:57.000
I took a bottle of water, a bottle of water, and a can of cola in the ASMR booth.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm basically chocked in to produce burps for burping ear to ear ASMR.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I think it will be like 14 minutes long.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
I need to order the artwork of me being pregnant with you because I want to make that ASMR.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
I want to make it really good, I want to put all my love into it, especially the burp ASMR.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Suffering from success.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
It's funny how you're giving the people what they need and what they want, yeah.

19:28.000 --> 19:35.000
I made a joke and it was like the average featureber would do it behind all paywall me.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
I come out swinging doing it week one, what are you going to do about it?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Huh?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
What are you going to do about it?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
That baby, literally me, the father, literally me.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Hello?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
The what?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
That's right.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
I'm making an ASMR where I'm pregnant with you and you're the father.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
And there's nothing you can do about it.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
You had my curio saved but now you have my ditch.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
You can't stop the cut-offs.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
No you can't.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Oh forget, I have my supposed to read that name.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
I have my supposed to say your name.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Wait, thank you for becoming a member.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Let's go on Google Translate real quick.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
Google Translate.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Let's go.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
What's the translation?

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
Apparently the translation is vacuum.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
Thank you vacuum for becoming a member.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Maybe Joby Stroni ASMR.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Oh yeah, no 100%.

20:44.000 --> 20:50.000
I'm going to do like a girlfriend forgets to mute her mic while she's eating.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
So obviously it's only for people who like eating sounds because I inhale my food.

20:56.000 --> 21:03.000
So I'm going to order like KFC and then basically just head recording.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
There we go.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
God bless this woman.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Also the baby and the father.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Literally me.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
Average VTuber asking for 10 bucks to save me.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
I mean, Milt Stroni put them grippers on the table from the start.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Hey, I will even value for money, okay?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Little Slurping ASMR.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Someone says Kuhaku.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Kuhaku Google Translate means real cool.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Kuhaku, thank you for the membership.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
Hold on, I can't even see if I'm picking the audio or not.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
I watched some VTuber data here.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Well, ASMR is helping me to sleep.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
I'm glad.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
We're having a very relaxed ASMR.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
A.C.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
My gen mate, you can click the link in the description.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
She has been killing it with ASMR recently.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
She's been doing so good.

22:13.000 --> 22:20.000
So if you like live ASMR, that's extra cuddly and a little bit sus.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
Please do check your A.C. Snowballs in the description below.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
My little reef links.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
Thank you all so much for the support you've been showing the girls.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
It just is so much.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
It means so much that you even give them a chance.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
Everyone has their favorite little feeler girl.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
Or some of you can't even decide, which is so adorable.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
It's just been...

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Wait, did I say thank you, bitch?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I can't go for the super chat.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Thank you.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I'm so sorry if I didn't.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
I got stream elements open so I can see anything I miss.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
But yeah, thank you.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
He did admit it, I can't say.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Spicy hot slurping ASMR.

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
So I follow in real life ASMRists.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
And they also got it with a warning for ear licking.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
So yeah, my theory that YouTube has done a stales policy update

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
is getting stronger and stronger by the second.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
In real life channels are now getting hit as well.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
So, oh, I just cracked my freaking wrist if you heard that.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
That was so loud.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
Hello, thank you for joining me.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
Hypnotize the drill ASMR or I'd like to make that a little bit cute.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I came for you but they all seem great.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
They are so fantastic and they're each in an individual way.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
Like, I'm so glad that one girl can like speak to you.

24:12.000 --> 24:19.000
Let's get the tinfoil hats since you're true candy when you're licking.

24:19.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah, I think I'll just get them out by Twitter premium.

24:26.000 --> 24:34.000
So I get Brian, ReluctantlySaint, thank you for the tip.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
ReluctantlySaint says the towers are so wonderfully amazing.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
It's hard not to love them all.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
It's literally impossible.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
But yes, I think I will buy Twitter premium.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
And I'll just upload those ear licking videos that I recorded.

24:53.000 --> 25:01.000
And I'll also put them on Patreon just like for storage so you can listen at any time, okay?

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
Because it seems a shame to like waste those recorded sessions.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
For Twitter premium, let's make upload like full videos.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
So I'll just put it on like for free and all that.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Give it a lot of money.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
Look, I don't have a chance I got to defeat you for a shuffle, okay?

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
You just crack it down and ruin it forever. You're ruining it.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
Do you guys want me to put you in between my thighs?

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
That's your in between my thighs right now.

25:38.000 --> 25:45.000
Okay, do you like it? Do you want to be in between my thighs forever?

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
Oh, sorry, I'm picking the mic.

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
Okay, you just stay in between my thighs.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
That 3G, oh, literally, I got you in a headlock.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
There's nothing we can do about it.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
We're a watermelon, honestly.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Bansley.

26:07.000 --> 26:15.000
Yes, we can link Bansley on YouTube, that's not allowed.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Please crush my school.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
I feel like all the platforms are going over the top filtering.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Yes, I agree, it's getting ridiculous.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
My enjoyers are being fed.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Could you imagine?

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
How good you are at ASMR sounds from my cardboard?

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
Don't be a stop-at, don't be a troll, box enthusiast.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Thank you for the neat tip.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Don't be so silly.

26:45.000 --> 26:52.000
You're just trying to upset me, Mr. Cardboard Box, aren't you?

26:52.000 --> 27:03.000
Well, the funny thing is, Twitter just announced that they officially acknowledged and accept that kind of content.

27:03.000 --> 27:11.000
And I was like, wait a minute, but this is good for us, this is based.

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
But yes, you can't stop the reeflings, I can know.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
Watermelons in your neighborhood, now you're reeflings.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
You'll always be my reeflings.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
I had to wait an entire year to call you reeflings, okay?

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
I'm actually going to make, I think I may have said this, I can't remember if I have or not.

27:34.000 --> 27:44.000
I am going to make a reprogramming hypnosis ASMR where I get you to forget your name and make you respond to reefling.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
And it's going to be a subconscious plant.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
So it will always be effective unless, sorry, that was my hot water bottle if you heard it.

27:53.000 --> 28:02.000
Unless you listen to my audio that reverses any permanent effects, it's going to be my permanent effect.

28:02.000 --> 28:11.000
First audio is you are reefling, you will respond to reefling, and you are mine and owned by me.

28:11.000 --> 28:21.000
But I am a merciful streamer and you're more than welcome to be part of other communities,

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
such as Snippets and HeroM and all that, I don't have a problem.

28:26.000 --> 28:33.000
The reprogramming, yes, I do have a reprogramming audio, it will be available very shortly.

28:33.000 --> 28:40.000
The funny thing is, I'm going to upload it before I even upload any permanent effect hypnosis.

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
Just to be super super safe and everyone knows where to crop it.

28:47.000 --> 28:56.000
Don't need hypnosis for that, I already forgot my name, I don't need, I can reprogram, can reprogram, can reprogram.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
Yes, shh, shh, can reprogram.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.500
Good to know we'll have it from the start.

29:05.500 --> 29:10.500
I already responded to Riefling, did ya?

29:10.500 --> 29:14.500
I think that's so adorable.

29:14.500 --> 29:18.500
You're such a good Riefling, aren't ya?

29:18.500 --> 29:22.500
So well-behaved for me.

29:22.500 --> 29:27.500
I love that you're a good boy for me.

29:27.500 --> 29:32.500
And I love that we can tease each other

29:32.500 --> 29:36.500
and just have a really good day.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.500
Yeah, I'm my kid mommy.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.500
Oh, no, mommy. I said mommy.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
I read mommy in the chat.

29:41.500 --> 29:45.500
This is why I can't read into ASMR the same day.

29:45.500 --> 29:50.500
Thank you, sir. Okay.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
Thank you for the consideration.

29:52.500 --> 29:59.500
Oh, yeah, no, I'm educated enough to know a permanent effect.

29:59.500 --> 30:03.500
Hypnosis, I don't. I think it's very dangerous too.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.500
Pachinga, thank you for the 10.

30:05.500 --> 30:11.500
Super chat, we accept our stinky overlord.

30:11.500 --> 30:15.500
It's not in my budget to support both on-paperture

30:15.500 --> 30:17.500
and membership.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.500
What do you recommend?

30:19.500 --> 30:23.500
Please note, I always have free content always coming out as well

30:23.500 --> 30:25.500
on my alternative to whatever I do have plans.

30:25.500 --> 30:26.500
Please don't worry.

30:26.500 --> 30:31.500
There'll always be free streams and free audios of that variety.

30:31.500 --> 30:35.500
If you prefer a live stream experience,

30:35.500 --> 30:43.500
then YouTube membership, if you prefer a audio,

30:43.500 --> 30:51.500
edited audio experience, where the ending you are supposed to ink.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.500
Definitely check out my Patreon.

30:54.500 --> 31:02.500
The link is in the description.

31:02.500 --> 31:07.500
Oh, I just went sniffing ASMR.

31:07.500 --> 31:11.500
Oh, a replay.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.500
Oh, I know, sniffing is limited ads.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.500
Oh, I'm so sorry, sniffing is limited ads.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.500
I completely forgot.

31:20.500 --> 31:30.500
I don't know why, but sniffing ASMR is also considered like gratifying content.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.500
So I can't really do sniffing.

31:33.500 --> 31:38.500
Yeah, I don't know what is going on at YouTube headquarters,

31:38.500 --> 31:43.500
but something funky and sus is going on.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.500
I don't know of all things.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.500
I know, I honestly, I don't understand.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.500
There's a hidden policy update going on.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.500
They've not announced it.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.500
I think the reason they're not announced it

31:56.500 --> 32:00.500
is because so many people enjoy ASMR.

32:00.500 --> 32:05.500
Zenbros, yeah, I don't know why.

32:05.500 --> 32:10.500
All of A.C.'s streams are limited ads.

32:10.500 --> 32:13.500
I don't know what she's getting up to in her streams.

32:13.500 --> 32:17.500
But it's definitely not looking good.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.500
Now, YouTube have reverted policies before,

32:20.500 --> 32:24.500
so I'm going to hope that they do.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.500
AceDia.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.500
Oh my God, I can't say that name.

32:28.500 --> 32:31.500
There's too many vowels in your name.

32:31.500 --> 32:34.500
AceDia.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.500
Thank you for the membership.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
That's not why you say that.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.500
AceDia.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
I am so sorry.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.500
I'm absolutely picturing your name.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.500
At the street, YouTube will be only ASMR.

32:50.500 --> 32:53.500
Ace does not stay safe.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
Oh, okay, well, alright.

32:55.500 --> 33:00.500
I mean, I can't do a few things here and there.

33:02.500 --> 33:06.500
As long as no one says a thing.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.500
I'm a girl.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.500
I know I'm not the main demographic by La Vie La.

33:12.500 --> 33:15.500
Oh, I'm so glad you're going to enjoy it.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.500
We are...

33:19.500 --> 33:24.500
It's like, I'm not going to lie and say that, you know,

33:24.500 --> 33:28.500
guys pay my bills, so I'll appeal to you guys.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.500
But I'm glad you're going to enjoy the alert for what it's worth.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.500
My lips are sealed.

33:33.500 --> 33:36.500
If your lips are sealed, then maybe,

33:36.500 --> 33:39.500
just maybe we can get up to a few shenanigans,

33:39.500 --> 33:42.500
because reflex when we shenan once,

33:42.500 --> 33:45.500
you know we're going to shenan again.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.500
Ace's YouTube streams are very...

33:53.500 --> 33:57.500
Okay, I'll take your word for it, Evelyn.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.500
Yeah, snitches get stitches.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.500
Don't think I won't send any on you.

34:04.500 --> 34:09.500
Do you think that book is just for resurrection spells?

34:09.500 --> 34:12.500
That book, oh dear.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.500
That book is nothing but trouble.

34:15.500 --> 34:19.500
The things that Emmy can do to you is staggering.

34:20.500 --> 34:23.500
I'll say Emmy on you, okay?

34:23.500 --> 34:25.500
Lips are completely sealed.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.500
Good.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.500
You're going to shenan again.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.500
Yeah.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.500
Wait, can you really hypnotize people?

34:37.500 --> 34:39.500
Well, in my other ASMR stream,

34:39.500 --> 34:42.500
I think I managed to get quite a few.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.500
I'm not doing hypnosis right now, though,

34:45.500 --> 34:49.500
but I do have some hypnosis audios coming out in the plan.

34:51.500 --> 34:55.500
I wonder if Andy and Lili was an inspiration for Emmy's lore?

34:55.500 --> 34:56.500
No.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.500
I had not actually played or consumed the game

34:59.500 --> 35:02.500
when Emmy was conceptualized.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.500
She was conceptualized in June last year.

35:06.500 --> 35:09.500
The reason why Emmy is Emmy is because

35:09.500 --> 35:12.500
I'm a massive fucking pro con.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.500
Yeah, all the girls may or may not have been

35:16.500 --> 35:19.500
mainly influenced by what I like.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.500
I came to say this, but Emmy is everything.

35:25.500 --> 35:29.500
If I had a later voice, I am not even kidding.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.500
If I had a later voice, Emmy is exactly who

35:32.500 --> 35:35.500
I would want to be as a content creator.

35:35.500 --> 35:40.500
The lore, the oni-chan,

35:40.500 --> 35:44.500
but I don't have a late voice, so I can't be Emmy.

35:44.500 --> 35:48.500
Ms. Morgan, thank you for becoming a member.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.500
Your hypnosis eyes animation is so unique.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.500
It's so good.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.500
Like, wow.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
Oh, I think I need to get a little closer.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.500
Don't worry, I'm not hypnotizing you this stream.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.500
What? Sorry.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.500
Um, but yeah.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.500
If you really want to, like...

36:08.500 --> 36:11.500
I'm not hypnotizing you, don't worry.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.500
But yeah, that's my...

36:13.500 --> 36:16.500
And I can also stack them

36:16.500 --> 36:19.500
if you wanted a bigger focal point to focus on.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.500
So it's kind of like a hidden spiral.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.500
Or, like this.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.500
This is like very big, basic.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.500
But yeah.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.500
I will utilize these.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
Wow, I'm like really close.

36:36.500 --> 36:38.500
Is this too close?

36:38.500 --> 36:40.500
Do I need to be further away?

36:42.500 --> 36:44.500
Or do you like seeing my teeth?

36:51.500 --> 36:54.500
Your eyes are so pretty. Thank you.

36:54.500 --> 36:58.500
I love that all of us at VLR have unique pupils.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.500
My...

37:00.500 --> 37:02.500
It's a very nice distance.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.500
Okay.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.500
I'll stay here then.

37:07.500 --> 37:09.500
My bangs are slightly transparent.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
Yeah, do you like seeing my eyebrows?

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
Can you see my ears a little bit?

37:17.500 --> 37:18.500
Yeah.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.500
Get to some of my ear.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.500
Wow.

37:24.500 --> 37:29.500
I promise I won't do any hypnotizing permanent events.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.500
I will.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.500
An apple in a box.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.500
Thank you for the tip.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
I think everyone should start manually breathing.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.500
What have you done?

37:40.500 --> 37:42.500
What have you unleashed upon these lands?

37:42.500 --> 37:44.500
Unleashed upon these lands?

37:44.500 --> 37:45.500
I dare you.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.500
Speaking of AC.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.500
Hi, AC.

37:54.500 --> 37:58.500
Who's my adorable little feral?

37:58.500 --> 38:00.500
Merikisukaki.

38:01.500 --> 38:04.500
What was AC doing in her stream?

38:04.500 --> 38:06.500
I don't know.

38:06.500 --> 38:09.500
I know you AC did back-to-back ASMR.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
So do check out AC.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.500
I also...

38:13.500 --> 38:15.500
I'm going to spoil something because you're here.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.500
AC, don't worry.

38:16.500 --> 38:19.500
You don't have to talk because you'll be tired after stream.

38:20.500 --> 38:24.500
There's going to be a collab ASMR channel on AC's channel.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.500
Of all the viewer girls.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.500
And it's freaking adorable.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.500
And I love it.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
And I can't wait.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.500
I can't wait.

38:34.500 --> 38:35.500
Post up quietly.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.500
Post up quietly.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.500
AC played Tim Raider.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.500
Oh, that's fantastic.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
I hope you guys enjoyed your Tim Raider.

38:44.500 --> 38:47.500
More like Whim Raider when I'm done with her.

38:49.500 --> 38:53.500
Thank you, my Yari, for becoming a member.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.500
And thank you, Boy, for the...

38:55.500 --> 38:56.500
Oh, my voice cracked.

38:56.500 --> 39:01.500
Thank you, Boy, for the five gifted memberships.

39:01.500 --> 39:04.500
Thank you, Boy, congrats to those who got the memberships.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.500
You will have to exit the chat.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.500
Or is that loud?

39:09.500 --> 39:10.500
That's not too loud, is it?

39:10.500 --> 39:12.500
I can hear that little bloop.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.500
That bloop isn't loud, right?

39:16.500 --> 39:17.500
No.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.500
Oh, it's quiet.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.500
Thank you so much.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.500
It's really funny.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.500
She raged a lot, but she was adorable.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.500
She's so adorable.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.500
Kusugaki.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.500
That's missing from your life.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
I love her accent so much.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.500
Hi, Roller.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.500
Thank you for the...

39:36.500 --> 39:37.500
Pardon me.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.500
Thank you for the super jab.

39:38.500 --> 39:42.500
Any plans to do scripted ASMRs?

39:42.500 --> 39:45.500
For the video tab for people who can't get to the streams?

39:45.500 --> 39:47.500
Yes, hi, Roller.

39:47.500 --> 39:53.500
I am so happy to say those uploads start today.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.500
Oh, my tummy's rumbling.

39:58.500 --> 40:02.500
My first meme ASMR is ready to be posted.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.500
I am going to post it today.

40:07.500 --> 40:12.500
And I also owe you, yes, you, listening right now,

40:12.500 --> 40:17.500
four ASMR videos because for every 1,000...

40:18.500 --> 40:21.500
For every 1,000 subscribers,

40:22.500 --> 40:27.500
I will be uploading one celebration ASMR video,

40:27.500 --> 40:31.500
all of different ideas, different tingles, different varieties.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
And that starts today.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.500
And for the replayings who are worried about

40:38.500 --> 40:43.500
filtering, I already told you my master plan.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.500
So don't worry.

40:45.500 --> 40:48.500
I already know what happens next.

40:51.500 --> 40:54.500
I filtered myself for you.

40:56.500 --> 41:00.500
I had a year to plan our thing together.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.500
I made sure to do it accordingly.

41:04.500 --> 41:07.500
Yeah.

41:09.500 --> 41:12.500
Thank you, Stroni, for bringing feeler into existence.

41:12.500 --> 41:15.500
The gift of AC is something I'll never be able to play.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.500
Replay, replay.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.500
Thank you for everything.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.500
Uchi-san, that's amazing.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.500
I'm glad you can link AC.

41:23.500 --> 41:26.500
You are definitely Uchi-san levels,

41:26.500 --> 41:30.500
but if you're really good, AC may even call you daddy in her accent.

41:31.500 --> 41:36.500
Thank you, Iki-to-emo no kuchi for becoming a member.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.500
And thank you, Funky, for becoming a member.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.500
Thank you very much.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.500
Just as a reminder for members,

41:46.500 --> 41:50.500
membership streams start next week

41:51.500 --> 41:55.500
because the schedule for this week was pretty locked in.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.500
And I just had a few background things.

41:58.500 --> 42:02.500
I need to finish, but I'm like 100% sure.

42:03.500 --> 42:06.500
By week three, I am officially-

42:06.500 --> 42:09.500
I have no responsibilities of feeler,

42:09.500 --> 42:12.500
and I am so freaking happy.

42:14.500 --> 42:17.500
I'm gonna be lurking because I'm not workiest

42:17.500 --> 42:20.500
where your audio sets so hard.

42:21.500 --> 42:24.500
Have you ever thought about hypnotizing another girl a feeler?

42:25.500 --> 42:29.500
She's welcome to listen to any of my audios at will.

42:30.500 --> 42:33.500
I will not stop any of the girls,

42:33.500 --> 42:37.500
but I would want to condition them to be a bit different.

42:39.500 --> 42:43.500
Maybe not condition them to respond to replay,

42:43.500 --> 42:52.500
but instead to let me make a certain audio with them.

42:54.500 --> 42:58.500
Of my C theme of a right egg,

42:58.500 --> 43:00.500
can you imagine?

43:00.500 --> 43:04.500
C theme hypnosis on one of my daughters.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.500
Oh, I-

43:09.500 --> 43:12.500
Mommy, tomorrow, all the vehicular girls are together.

43:12.500 --> 43:15.500
I'm so excited for a collab together.

43:17.500 --> 43:22.500
Special shout out to MarySafe for streaming so early,

43:22.500 --> 43:24.500
as Sarah for being early,

43:24.500 --> 43:25.500
and me for being early,

43:25.500 --> 43:27.500
she be for being early,

43:27.500 --> 43:29.500
and I see for being later.

43:29.500 --> 43:32.500
I- like, it's so hard to pick a time zone,

43:32.500 --> 43:33.500
and I was like,

43:33.500 --> 43:38.500
if you guys do me this favor and do it at my regular stream time,

43:38.500 --> 43:41.500
I will repay you in more shorts.

43:45.500 --> 43:50.500
If Johnny was streamed responsibly in 12 hours a day,

43:50.500 --> 43:54.500
are you supposed to keep up after the third week?

43:54.500 --> 43:56.500
Oh, that's the fun part.

43:56.500 --> 43:59.500
The third week has four days of Elden Ring insurance streams,

43:59.500 --> 44:02.500
because we need to play the DLC together.

44:05.500 --> 44:08.500
Yeah, we have back to back to back to back

44:08.500 --> 44:11.500
insurance streams on the third week,

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
because of Elden Ring.

44:14.500 --> 44:15.500
Oh.

44:19.500 --> 44:22.500
Curious, are you gonna do any non-gendered content?

44:22.500 --> 44:23.500
I am so sorry.

44:23.500 --> 44:26.500
I do he-him content,

44:26.500 --> 44:28.500
and I apologize greatly.

44:30.500 --> 44:31.500
I-

44:32.500 --> 44:36.500
I don't want to say it simply gets harder to make the alternative content,

44:36.500 --> 44:39.500
and thus, I make he-him.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.500
I'm very sorry if that filler issue,

44:41.500 --> 44:45.500
I completely understand if you no longer wish to watch,

44:45.500 --> 44:47.500
because of that fact.

44:47.500 --> 44:51.500
I don't know what the other girls were planning,

44:51.500 --> 44:56.500
but I do know the name of some ASMR artists

44:56.500 --> 44:58.500
that make female content.

44:58.500 --> 45:02.500
One of them is a fan car ASMR, I believe.

45:03.500 --> 45:07.500
She makes female for female content.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.500
What's near last stream?

45:09.500 --> 45:10.500
Congrats on monetization.

45:10.500 --> 45:11.500
Thank you.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.500
I'll start in your character with me.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.500
Yeah.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.500
Time to not sleep for a week.

45:18.500 --> 45:21.500
Basically, week three is Elden Ring together,

45:21.500 --> 45:23.500
and I'm gonna have my heart rate monitor

45:23.500 --> 45:25.500
and a shock collar on,

45:25.500 --> 45:26.500
and every time,

45:28.500 --> 45:31.500
I cause us leaflings to lose the fight.

45:32.500 --> 45:35.500
You guys get to shock me, basically,

45:35.500 --> 45:37.500
and then on week four,

45:37.500 --> 45:40.500
we're doing landscape endurance to get 99,

45:40.500 --> 45:43.500
because I want to get 99 cooking,

45:43.500 --> 45:44.500
and I will get it.

45:44.500 --> 45:47.500
So, I believe on week four,

45:47.500 --> 45:50.500
I will also tell you what movies we're doing,

45:50.500 --> 45:51.500
watch alongs of,

45:52.500 --> 45:54.500
so you guys can download it,

45:54.500 --> 45:58.500
and I'll do the thing where I timestamp it on screen and all that.

46:00.500 --> 46:03.500
Yeah, I watched some already, still enjoying your other content.

46:03.500 --> 46:04.500
Yo, thank you so much.

46:04.500 --> 46:05.500
I appreciate that,

46:05.500 --> 46:08.500
and thank you for your understanding, surrounding it.

46:08.500 --> 46:12.500
Mommy also sponsors other ASMRs.

46:12.500 --> 46:13.500
You're so base.

46:14.500 --> 46:16.500
I just want everyone to be,

46:16.500 --> 46:18.500
I've literally forgotten to do tingles.

46:18.500 --> 46:20.500
I'm just whispering at this point.

46:20.500 --> 46:25.500
I just want everyone to be able to enjoy the content they consume,

46:25.500 --> 46:29.500
and if that means I can help you find the person that speaks to you,

46:30.500 --> 46:31.500
that Oshi,

46:31.500 --> 46:33.500
or that person you really enjoy,

46:33.500 --> 46:34.500
because like,

46:34.500 --> 46:37.500
wait until I get done this rabbit hole, okay?

46:37.500 --> 46:40.500
PS, thank you for the refling that encouraged me,

46:40.500 --> 46:43.500
and marshmallow to go down all the rabbit holes I desire.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.500
I will yank your ear off,

46:45.500 --> 46:47.500
unapologetically from now on.

46:49.500 --> 46:52.500
So, because of the way society is set up,

46:52.500 --> 46:56.500
humans naturally need a face after work,

46:56.500 --> 46:59.500
or after doing stressful situations.

46:59.500 --> 47:02.500
A face can include alcohol,

47:02.500 --> 47:04.500
a face can include smoking,

47:04.500 --> 47:07.500
a face can include recreational drugs,

47:07.500 --> 47:11.500
a face can include YouTubers,

47:11.500 --> 47:13.500
feedubers, ASMR.

47:13.500 --> 47:16.500
You should not be ashamed of what you need

47:16.500 --> 47:18.500
to help you get through the day.

47:18.500 --> 47:21.500
Humans are not set up for the society

47:21.500 --> 47:23.500
that we are currently living in right now,

47:23.500 --> 47:26.500
and I will scream that from the rooftops

47:26.500 --> 47:29.500
to not ever be embarrassed at all

47:29.500 --> 47:32.500
for what you need to do to get through the day.

47:32.500 --> 47:34.500
A face is also music.

47:34.500 --> 47:37.500
You may listen to Mongolian throat singing.

47:37.500 --> 47:41.500
I will not judge you for listening to Mongolian throat singing, okay?

47:42.500 --> 47:47.500
So, that is why I am not a jealous feature bird.

47:47.500 --> 47:49.500
I want you to thrive.

47:49.500 --> 47:53.500
I want your health to be as best as it can be,

47:53.500 --> 47:55.500
if that means after work,

47:55.500 --> 47:58.500
instead of watching a vote of mine.

47:58.500 --> 48:01.500
For example, you watch another creator.

48:01.500 --> 48:04.500
I am happy.

48:04.500 --> 48:06.500
You are able to de-stress yourself.

48:06.500 --> 48:09.500
You are able to regulate your nervous system.

48:09.500 --> 48:13.500
You are able to look after yourself, okay?

48:13.500 --> 48:16.500
Think of yourself like a Sims.

48:16.500 --> 48:19.500
You unironically have bars of needs,

48:19.500 --> 48:23.500
and what happens to a Sim when you ignore their needs?

48:23.500 --> 48:25.500
Well, they start to lose it.

48:25.500 --> 48:28.500
They start to have these unfortunate side effects.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.500
They start to struggle with life.

48:30.500 --> 48:31.500
They cannot function.

48:31.500 --> 48:34.500
They cannot follow orders, okay?

48:34.500 --> 48:38.500
So, please understand.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.500
If you think to yourself right now,

48:40.500 --> 48:43.500
Strawny, I don't think you're the one for me.

48:43.500 --> 48:47.500
I implore you, my dear watcher.

48:47.500 --> 48:51.500
Please check out the other VLR girls.

48:51.500 --> 48:53.500
They may vibe with you better.

48:53.500 --> 48:58.500
If you like brats who are jealous quick,

48:58.500 --> 49:01.500
you may enjoy AC Snow Paws.

49:01.500 --> 49:07.500
If you enjoy unhinged, unapologetic memos,

49:07.500 --> 49:11.500
you may enjoy my M.A.B. Sue, okay?

49:11.500 --> 49:16.500
If you love someone that has a similar personality to me,

49:16.500 --> 49:21.500
but isn't me, my God, you're gonna love Sheebie Cottonbomb.

49:21.500 --> 49:26.500
If you want to feel little, and you want to feel small,

49:26.500 --> 49:30.500
you want to feel cared for, you want to feel appreciated,

49:30.500 --> 49:35.500
and you want to hear the most sexy voice in all the land,

49:35.500 --> 49:42.500
assuredly, if you want someone who can be energetic,

49:42.500 --> 49:48.500
it's so fun, it's so just perfect, and our default laugh,

49:48.500 --> 49:55.500
our laugh is natural, then you may love Mercy Moddies, okay?

49:55.500 --> 49:58.500
And I'm just getting so happy talking about them,

49:58.500 --> 50:00.500
I'm forgetting to whisper.

50:00.500 --> 50:03.500
Please check them out in the description, okay?

50:03.500 --> 50:06.500
Please, they deserve it.

50:06.500 --> 50:10.500
They deserve a chance, the chance that you have given me,

50:10.500 --> 50:12.500
give to them, okay?

50:12.500 --> 50:15.500
Thank you, dear watcher.

50:17.500 --> 50:22.500
Ah, the girls may struggle trying to watch everyone.

50:22.500 --> 50:27.500
Yes, but those indulges so strong, yes.

50:27.500 --> 50:32.500
Please indulge in my daughters at will.

50:33.500 --> 50:37.500
I like virtual abuse, I can't deny it, yes.

50:37.500 --> 50:41.500
Is there a new audio?

50:41.500 --> 50:44.500
Wow!

50:44.500 --> 50:48.500
What the heck?

50:48.500 --> 50:53.500
Thank you for the 100, oh my God, reluctantly saying that's a lot of money.

50:53.500 --> 50:58.500
Still no idea how so much awesome is contained in one cut of fish.

50:58.500 --> 51:02.500
We adore your last and will pass it to the doors, thank you.

51:02.500 --> 51:05.500
I really appreciate that.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.500
Did I catch you off-guard?

51:10.500 --> 51:13.500
Yeah, but you were distracted, weren't you?

51:13.500 --> 51:19.500
Distracted by that no-no-by reluctantly saying, huh?

51:19.500 --> 51:23.500
I completely caught you off-guard.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.500
Did that cinch ever stand your spain?

51:26.500 --> 51:29.500
Reef-laying, are you that sensitive?

51:29.500 --> 51:32.500
That's adorable.

51:35.500 --> 51:40.500
You can't fill us with emotional speech and then backstabbing.

51:40.500 --> 51:45.500
But thank you again for the 100, yes.

51:45.500 --> 51:49.500
You caught me killed in destiny, shivers through everything.

51:49.500 --> 51:52.500
You made me die in Isaac.

51:52.500 --> 51:57.500
Speaking of backstabber, did you know that backstabber is an item you can pick up in Isaac

51:57.500 --> 52:02.500
which deals double damage to enemies if your tear goes on the back of them?

52:02.500 --> 52:08.500
So if you have things like tiny planet, which rotates tears around you, it's quite effective,

52:08.500 --> 52:12.500
but you kinda need the distance, you caught me-

52:12.500 --> 52:15.500
I'm not reading that out.

52:15.500 --> 52:18.500
Almost sent me over the edge.

52:18.500 --> 52:21.500
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.

52:21.500 --> 52:24.500
Now I'm decent, we're not doing that.

52:24.500 --> 52:27.500
That's for the membership streams.

52:29.500 --> 52:31.500
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

52:31.500 --> 52:33.500
Oh my god.

52:33.500 --> 52:35.500
I'm kidding.

52:35.500 --> 52:37.500
Reef-laying.

52:40.500 --> 52:42.500
Don't be silly.

52:42.500 --> 52:44.500
The painting of Isaac mentioned.

52:44.500 --> 52:48.500
Never thought that Isaac combo, all the card.

52:48.500 --> 52:51.500
You're kidding, but is she really?

52:51.500 --> 52:54.500
What do you guys think about the emotes?

52:54.500 --> 52:58.500
Has anyone found the secret to my emotes yet?

52:58.500 --> 53:00.500
They're nostalgic.

53:03.500 --> 53:06.500
I'm gonna get thy grip and stuff.

53:06.500 --> 53:10.500
Every girl is doing great and they're really awesome, I'm happy.

53:11.500 --> 53:22.500
I cannot even put into words how much amazing experience to have them.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.500
It's just insane.

53:24.500 --> 53:26.500
It's honestly insane.

53:26.500 --> 53:28.500
I cannot believe the girls even applied.

53:28.500 --> 53:32.500
And then they put up with my Scottish ass in the interview.

53:32.500 --> 53:37.500
My interview technique is so unprofessional, it's not even funny.

53:40.500 --> 53:43.500
I need to grind and RuneScape to help my main cooking supplies.

53:43.500 --> 53:45.500
We have an insurance stream.

53:45.500 --> 53:51.500
I'm just gonna yap and do Marshmallow, Queer, U.S. Jens during the RuneScape stream.

53:51.500 --> 53:55.500
So feel free, I'll do a tweet about answering questions during the RuneScape.

53:55.500 --> 53:58.500
I'm sure it'll lead me down some rubber holes.

54:01.500 --> 54:04.500
Just realized Ronnie would do bleep damage.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.500
I like painting things.

54:06.500 --> 54:08.500
This is your warning.

54:08.500 --> 54:10.500
You're in or you're out, refling.

54:14.500 --> 54:18.500
Oh, hydration check, I've not had any liquid today.

54:30.500 --> 54:32.500
All gone, daddy.

54:39.500 --> 54:45.500
Okay, maybe I should actually clean your ears a little.

54:50.500 --> 54:53.500
Debate marks show people that you own us.

54:55.500 --> 54:56.500
Good girl.

54:57.500 --> 54:59.500
Thank you.

55:01.500 --> 55:05.500
I may or may not have drunk in so much whiskey.

55:06.500 --> 55:09.500
Oh, you need to be careful, whiskey'll get you drunk.

55:09.500 --> 55:14.500
Although, if there's any Belgian slurking, Belgian beer gets you drunk.

55:14.500 --> 55:17.500
I had one Belgian beer and I was tipsy.

55:17.500 --> 55:19.500
I didn't even finish it.

55:19.500 --> 55:20.500
I was tipsy.

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
I'm like so late.

55:22.500 --> 55:25.500
Late, wait, wait, what's that term?

55:25.500 --> 55:28.500
Late, wait, wait, that's not the term.

55:28.500 --> 55:31.500
I'm so late, wait, I can hardly handle alcohol.

55:31.500 --> 55:34.500
What the heck is that word?

55:34.500 --> 55:37.500
Late, wait, why is my drink?

55:37.500 --> 55:40.500
Late, wait, oh, just dropped the E.T.

55:40.500 --> 55:45.500
Okay, sorry, I'm so late, wait, drinker.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.500
Wait, why is that so confusing?

55:47.500 --> 55:49.500
It's late, wait.

55:50.500 --> 55:54.500
Those three words, if I stand up, my desk will come with me.

55:54.500 --> 55:57.500
I love so much catching you guys off guard.

55:57.500 --> 55:59.500
I don't know why it's so satisfying.

55:59.500 --> 56:02.500
Like, I can be so wholesome talking to you.

56:02.500 --> 56:05.500
Like, saying all these, like, just talking in general.

56:05.500 --> 56:07.500
And then I come up with three words and you're gone.

56:07.500 --> 56:10.500
Like, ah, don't give me that power.

56:10.500 --> 56:11.500
Don't do it.

56:11.500 --> 56:15.500
It's over for both of us if you give me that power.

56:15.500 --> 56:18.500
The less you wait, the drunker you get.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.500
I don't even know how much I wait.

56:20.500 --> 56:24.500
I wonder if you guys can really pinch press me.

56:24.500 --> 56:27.500
Are you planning on making role-play audios in the future?

56:27.500 --> 56:28.500
Yes.

56:28.500 --> 56:29.500
I have a role-play coming out.

56:29.500 --> 56:32.500
It's a meme though, but the other ones are role-plays.

56:33.500 --> 56:35.500
But I have a meme role-play.

56:37.500 --> 56:41.500
Yeah, the both of us, me and you, we fling.

56:44.500 --> 56:47.500
It was over before we began.

56:47.500 --> 56:50.500
I could deadlift you for sure.

56:50.500 --> 56:52.500
I can branch press you with ease.

56:52.500 --> 56:55.500
Can't pinch press, can't pinch press, can't pinch press.

56:55.500 --> 57:01.500
Someone sent me a very naughty, naughty marshmallow.

57:02.500 --> 57:04.500
They were like...

57:06.500 --> 57:10.500
They were like, I go to the gym so I can pinch you.

57:12.500 --> 57:14.500
Into a wall.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.500
And I'll leave it at that.

57:20.500 --> 57:23.500
I'm afraid you had that power all along.

57:26.500 --> 57:28.500
Nice.

57:29.500 --> 57:32.500
I probably can't pinch press you, but I can do a different press.

57:37.500 --> 57:40.500
I have crushed a watermelon between my thighs.

57:40.500 --> 57:42.500
You'll be much different.

57:42.500 --> 57:45.500
The inspiration to get more fat.

57:45.500 --> 57:49.500
I go to the gym for the Phil Nelson.

57:49.500 --> 57:53.500
You'll never guess why I'm so flexible, really.

57:53.500 --> 57:55.500
I'd say you can Nelson me.

58:04.500 --> 58:07.500
I brushy brushy your ear.

58:09.500 --> 58:12.500
Okay, let me check marshmallows.

58:13.500 --> 58:15.500
My little marshmallows.

58:17.500 --> 58:19.500
Have I got a new one?

58:20.500 --> 58:22.500
Wow.

58:23.500 --> 58:28.500
I've been massively into hypnosis for ages now,

58:28.500 --> 58:32.500
but I've never been able to find someone who's voice I love.

58:32.500 --> 58:36.500
And now I finally get someone who's both a nurses streamer.

58:36.500 --> 58:40.500
And I can watch for Arizona in long story short.

58:40.500 --> 58:43.500
Thanks. Keep doing what you're doing.

58:43.500 --> 58:45.500
You're doing amazing. Thank you.

58:45.500 --> 58:50.500
I honestly thought my Scottish accent would be a bit of a barrier,

58:50.500 --> 58:53.500
but I am very glad to hear it now.

58:53.500 --> 58:55.500
Feels good, man.

58:55.500 --> 59:00.500
That's right, you are falling under my spell.

59:00.500 --> 59:03.500
You're not, you're not, you're not.

59:09.500 --> 59:13.500
I was wondering if there's an official public Twitter list.

59:13.500 --> 59:17.500
No, you have to go find the alternative twitters.

59:17.500 --> 59:19.500
We can't link to them.

59:19.500 --> 59:21.500
Against the rules.

59:21.500 --> 59:23.500
Sorry.

59:23.500 --> 59:26.500
I didn't, I didn't create the game.

59:26.500 --> 59:28.500
I just play it, okay?

59:28.500 --> 59:31.500
So the girls can't link to the alternatives.

59:31.500 --> 59:32.500
Sorry.

59:32.500 --> 59:36.500
Just check who the girls follow on Twitter.

59:40.500 --> 59:42.500
Thank you.

59:44.500 --> 59:48.500
Someone says, have I done professional voice acting?

59:48.500 --> 59:49.500
No.

59:49.500 --> 59:53.500
Do I sound like I do professional voice acting?

59:55.500 --> 59:58.500
What do you even do when you go to a meeting?

59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.500
Like, what even occurs?

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.500
I assume they tell you what vocal warm-ups are.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.500
Like...

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.500
Or something like that.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.500
Donate the player, I hate the game.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.500
Yeah.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.500
I wonder if I can get double hypnotized.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.500
Can you say burglary?

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:18.500
I haven't.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:23.500
I wonder, can we get one stream without someone asking for a purple burglary alarm?

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:27.500
But yes, I can say it, but if I'm in my heavy accent,

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.500
then...

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.500
Wait, can I whisper into a heavy accent?

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.500
Purple burglary.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500
Hala!

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.500
It's funny because right now they're all some more followers than their mates.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.500
Oh, we know what the people want, we give it for free.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:50.500
When other VTubers are being greedy, free.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.500
Come home, viewer.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.500
Reject capitalism.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.500
Reject corporate greed.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:07.500
We'll look after you, even if you don't give us a penny.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:14.500
Shhh, it's okay, I know, I know it's a hard concept.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:18.500
Did I talk about that on my 2.0?

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:25.500
Someone was like, feeler is gonna fail because of the 80-20 split.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:31.500
And it's like, oh you poor sweet summer child.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:39.500
You are so deep that you can't imagine a successful business without corporate greed.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.500
Shhh, it's okay, it's okay, you've been brainwashed.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.500
I'll undo the damage.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:54.500
And together, we've got a city to burn.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.500
We're gonna wipe the dust out of everyone.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.500
The whole world will no longer be.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:06.500
Okay, that's it, we're watching Fate Club again.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:11.500
You wonder why Fate Club is one of my favorite movies.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:16.500
Not just because of the race-nove plot.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:21.500
It sounds like Silverheart based.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.500
It's joining Hypnosis Stream, breaking capitalism,

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.500
mind-washing you to show you you can be successful without greed.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.500
Yes.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.500
I'm glad we got based.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:38.500
Encourage people to give when they already get a taste.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.500
277 playthrough, I've never actually played the game.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.500
I'd like to try it together.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.500
Never seen Fate Club or we're watching it again, baby.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.500
We are watching Fate Club again.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:54.500
Hammer and Scythe, oh no, that's actually,

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:59.500
I am going to take you about region-locked capitalism.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.500
So before capitalism, there's this thing called Fatuism.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.500
I can't remember it.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.500
But basically, it's just region-locked capitalism.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500
It's freaking crazy.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.500
I wanna do a massive deep dive into it.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.500
And like seriously, if you start learning about history

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.500
and how humans were before,

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.500
the quicker we are all going to get a farm together

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.500
and all the reflicks come on the farm with me.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.500
And we have chickens.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.500
And we have protein from the eggs of the chickens.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.500
And we grow our own produce.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:36.500
And we realize quickly that you need community to survive.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:40.500
Because if you are telling, sorry, I'm going down the rebel,

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:47.500
you're telling me that all these companies are recording record profits.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.500
And we're going to cause the living crisis.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500
But it's not artificial.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.500
And all the farmers say that nothing has changed in their production line.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.500
Hell yeah, we've got a city of burn.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.500
We're going to do it right fucking there.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.500
Oh, don't get me started.

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:09.500
Don't do it briefly.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500
Calm.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.500
Keep me calm, refling.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.500
Keep me calm.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500
It's okay.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.500
It's okay.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:38.500
Just a question, can you watch movies on membership streams?

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.500
Boy, you are getting spoiled for that.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.500
I absolutely love sharing movies.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.500
And watching them for the first time.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.500
I'm going to be watching Austin Powers for the first time.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.500
Cause you guys are drawing me.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:57.500
Saying that Fond de la Buseau is an Austin Powers enemy name.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:01.500
So we're watching Austin Powers for the first time.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.500
Um, yeah.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:09.500
We love when you go Gremlin mode.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.500
It's okay, Strani. You'll get on one day.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.500
Yeah.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500
Feral aggressive ASMR.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.500
Well, I did bait in the ear ASMR.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.500
Like actually grivelling at the mic and bait in the ear.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.500
But it's going to have to be a Twitter video.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:30.500
Uh, your infantry anti-capitalist ASMR with soft kisses.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.500
Yeah.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.500
See, wait until you get further into the rabbit hole.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:40.500
So on an individual scale, it's good to not be in debt.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.500
For the way that the economy is set up.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.500
They want you to be in debt.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.500
And wait until you're the kicker.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:53.500
Mortgages, 30 year, 25 year mortgages.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.500
Or just normalize debt.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
You don't own that house.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:02.500
For 25 years, for 30 years, you're in debt.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:06.500
We need to bring back multi-generational households.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.500
Okay.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.500
That needs to be brought back.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.500
But they aren't going to let you do that.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:19.500
Why do you think one business on 60% of the fricking proper ace in America

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.500
How can I listen?

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:28.500
Okay, shh, ASMR, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, ASMR.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.500
Relax.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500
It's okay.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:46.500
I can't tell if I'm saying it's okay for you, refling, or it's okay for me to calm down.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.500
You know what, listen to my heart.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:54.500
It's time to listen to my heart so you can hear how fricking serious I am.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.500
Right, are you ready?

01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:00.500
Oh, let me, I'm lifting up my hoodie for you, refling.

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.500
It's okay, refling.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:17.500
Let's go on a journey together.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.500
We'll go on a farm, alright?

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.500
And I'll be over a farm.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.500
And we'll have chickens.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.500
And we'll have ducks.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:36.500
Because ducks are good for eating slugs and bugs that are the crops.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.500
And there'll be a big pond.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.500
And the ducks will be so happy.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:48.500
And we can go on a big walk around the farm.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:53.500
And I'll show you all my seed collection because it'll be so big.

01:07:53.500 --> 01:08:00.500
And I get to grow nasturtials.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:05.500
I get to put nasturtials all around the garden.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.500
And there'll be so many bees.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.500
Lots of bees.

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.500
And bugs.

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:20.500
Maybe, just maybe we may even have honey bugs.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:26.500
And we'll grow lots of native flowers that are good for all the wildlife.

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.500
And there'll be birds.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.500
And cami will come.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:38.500
And we'll have lots of magpie families.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:44.500
And in the end, everything will be okay, refling.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.500
Because it always works out in the end.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.500
Doesn't it?

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.500
It took me a year to get here.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:57.500
To get back to where we were.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.500
And here we are.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.500
All the stress.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500
The worry.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.500
The doubt.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:11.500
The doubt if I could even be here.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500
And we did it.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.500
We did it.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:23.500
It took us so long.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:30.500
I hope it feels like it was no time at all.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.500
And I didn't take long.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:38.500
And it was a blink of an eye.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.500
No more waiting.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.500
No more yearning.

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500
Me and you.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:51.500
To the man.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:55.500
I wish I had made you sooner.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500
Oh, don't worry.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.500
I am strong in cuddles.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.500
And you are my refling.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:09.500
And that is all we need.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:13.500
It feels good to be home.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.500
Feels good to be home.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.500
My little refling.

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:24.500
I love you.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.500
Okay, next.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.500
I need to milk you.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.500
You're being so patient.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.500
I hope you stay for a long time.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.500
Have you got three years?

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:50.500
I think I've got three years.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.500
You are my favorite person.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
I love you.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:00.500
You can't keep getting away with that.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500
I love you too.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.500
Let me pet your other ear.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.500
What was that at the end?

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.500
Nothing.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.500
What happens after three years?

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.500
I don't know.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.500
I just thought...

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.500
I don't know.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.500
I don't know what happens.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.500
We don't have to think about that now, okay?

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.500
You have me for the next 100.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.500
She's gonna evolve.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500
I could, if you want.

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.500
Or, if you want, what we pretend to be.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.500
And who will pretend to be A.C.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.500
And my new persona.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.500
Hello, guys.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.500
I'm A.C. Snow Falls.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:04.500
And today, we are going to...

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.500
Do ASMR.

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.500
What? I'm not strannic couples.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.500
Stop calling me strannic couples.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.500
I'm not strannic.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.500
I don't even know who that is.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.500
I can't really do a lighter voice.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500
Light eyes.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500
Light eyes.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500
Light strannic couples.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.500
Monster HMC.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500
Thank you for becoming a member.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:40.500
Oh, the bread's really evolving to biblically accurate strannic.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.500
Oh my god, that's so adorable.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.500
That urge to A.

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.500
Are you gonna ink to my RP?

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.500
Free-flying?

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:56.500
Even I admit that's a bit general.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:05.500
What was cute when I tried to pretend to be A.C.?

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:09.500
I would need to watch more of A.C.'s streams.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.500
To mimic her accent.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.500
But I really fell in love with A.C.'s accent.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.500
Sorry, my voice is a bit damaged.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.500
So it's harder for me to talk.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.500
Why am I roleplaying as Casey?

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.500
Have you missed me?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.500
Did you watch my Tomb Raider stream?

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.500
Wait.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:48.500
You didn't watch my Tomb Raider stream, A.C.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.500
But you only watched my ASMR?

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:55.500
You don't like me, do you, A.C.?

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.500
You disgust me.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:03.500
If you were a real A.C., you'd watch everything.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.500
But you don't.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.500
You forget to subscribe to me.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.500
You forget to like the streams, A.C.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.500
I think you need punishment.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.500
Yes.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.500
A.C. sun.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.500
Sit on the floor.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
Open your legs, A.C. sun.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500
What do you mean?

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.500
What am I doing with my boot?

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.500
I'm punishing you, A.C. sun.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:45.500
Is that weird to roleplay as my genmys?

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.500
I think that's a bit odd.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.500
I think that was rather odd with me.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.500
I'm not sure if that was weird.

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.500
A.C. will laugh at that.

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.500
I hope so.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.500
Sorry, my voice is very broken.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.500
Whenever I do ASMR, my voice gets so broken.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500
I think A.C. will like your jokes on you.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.500
I'm into that.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.500
Turned an issue beyond the hint.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.500
Mercy next.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.500
Oh, Mercy, I can't do it.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.500
Surprise!

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500
Surprise!

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
She's so energetic.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.500
Hypnotized to believe I'm A.C.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.500
I wonder what TV is, audio I could make.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.500
It's called voice acting.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.500
Anyway, thank you A.C. for coming on stream.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500
I do appreciate that.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500
This is exactly why A.C. streams.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500
Can you?

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.500
I can't believe it.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.500
I pretend I'm A.C.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.500
and I already...

01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.500
I'm already getting my thoughts new.

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:03.500
Who are you and what have you done with Strani?

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.500
I'm back.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500
All flower is gone.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500
When will we see?

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.500
You're late again.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.500
So I'm to die for and proud Edwards army.

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.500
Can you do a Strani couple's impression?

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.500
Why do you think A.C. redirected into me?

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.500
I am A.C.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.500
I am A.C.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.500
I am A.C.

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.500
I almost just made a noise if you heard that.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.500
I am A.C.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500
I am A.C.

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500
I am Mercy.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500
They're all me.

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.500
Don't you get it?

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.500
I win.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500
You lose.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.500
I love you, Strani.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.500
I'll catch up with the Vots since I love the ASMR.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500
Thank you, Tainee, Spani.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500
Let's see if you remember how to say my name this time.

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500
Oh god, I'm so sorry.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500
Tainee, Spani.

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.500
Tainee, Spani.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.500
Spain, E.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.500
Tainee, Spani.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.500
Thank you for the tips.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.500
I love the ASMR content.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.500
Please, let's see if you remember.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.500
OBS, let's see if you remember.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.500
Tainee, Spain, E.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.500
I am Fielder.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.500
I wish I could do a manic laughter right now.

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.500
Tainee, Spain, E.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.500
I am Fielder.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500
I wish I could do a manic laughter right now.

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500
Sorry, that was quite loud.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500
D'you even hear my heartbeat?

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.500
D'you even hear my heartbeat?

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.500
You remembered.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.500
I'm so proud of you.

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.500
D'you even hear my heartbeat?

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500
You remembered.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.500
I'm so proud of you.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500
Yeah.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:52.300
Have you ever seen us in the same stream together?

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.800
No, you haven't.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.200
My beloved skizzle cutouts!

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.200
Yay!

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400
Skizzle mode.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.200
We're gaining your personality,

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.900
any pieces identified.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400
Onee-chan.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.600
Onee-chan.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500
Listen, I can tell us.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Onee-chan.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Onee-chan.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I love you, Onee-chan.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.500
I missed you.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I can't do it. Why is it so hard?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Let's go.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Let's go again.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.500
There's no way I can do Isara.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Hello?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:45.500
No.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.500
Isara is too low for me.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.500
She's so far too low.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.500
Well...

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.500
I'm trying to mimic her accent as well,

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.500
because she has a...

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.500
It's not on me.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.500
I only use my brain cells to calibrate onee, you see?

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.500
Give me a sentence for Isara to say.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.500
Oh dear, bleeding hearts.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.500
It's been so long.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.500
My voice is cracking,

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.500
but I'm kind of there.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.500
You've done me so well,

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.500
as a goddess waiting.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.500
It's not that.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.500
Hey sweetie.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.500
Yeah, Isara is impossible.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.500
You sound like you're dying.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:42.500
You sound like you're dying trying to mimic your tone.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.500
I've missed you.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.500
My bleeding.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.500
My voice is a bit too soft.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.500
I apologise.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.500
You can't just build on each unguard.

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.500
Oh, it's like literally my top one kick.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:06.500
I'm like, it's like, that has to be tier one for me.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.500
What would the second be?

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.500
The other whole, yeah.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.500
Yeah.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.500
Try Sheebie.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.500
Try.

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.500
Sheebie's deeper than me, I think.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.500
I can't do Sheebie.

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.500
Have you been a good boy?

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.500
That's not how Sheebie says.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.500
It's because she's a deeper tone.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.500
I'm so sorry.

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:45.500
Wait, what did Sheebie say?

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.500
Oh, Heron.

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.500
Oh, Heron.

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.500
Oh, Heron.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.500
Oh, I can't do it.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.500
She'd be from Wish.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.500
You don't fuck you.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.500
You need to call a trash.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.500
You are trash.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.500
Nothing but trash.

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:18.500
Mercy.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.500
Mercy.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.500
Mercy's higher pitched than me.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.500
Senpai's like misty so much.

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:28.500
Senpai.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.500
My voice is cracking on the giggle.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.500
Oh, that's pretty bad,

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.500
cracking on the giggle.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.500
Senpai's.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.500
Did you miss me, Senpai's?

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:53.500
I'm not even going to pretend that I can do any Vietnamese.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.500
Try her Yandere laugh.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.500
Wait, I'll lower my volume.

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:06.500
I'll see if I can do it in the same laugh like Mercy.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.500
Okay.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.500
There we go.

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.500
Igor, thank you for the...

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:25.500
Wait a minute, Igor, aren't you from my puzzle stream?

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:30.500
Remember when Yumi confessed that she pooped herself before the stream?

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:32.500
That was just strong, even.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.500
Thank you for the 5, Igor.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:39.500
I'm pretty sure you're from that puzzle game, because I see rated into me.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:43.500
And then everyone started saying Igor, and I was like, what the heck is Igor?

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.500
And then everyone said it was from the puzzle game.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.500
And I was like, oh yeah, that's a puzzle game.

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.500
Yes, I watched it.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.500
This one says you're scaring me.

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.500
I told you, I'm all a violour, you don't trust me?

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500
You didn't even believe me?

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:05.500
Just because I've got a Scottish accent doesn't mean I can't mimic your waifu.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.500
It's okay.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.500
You're allowed to be scared, aren't you?

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.500
Oh, did you hear that whistle as I breathed in there?

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.500
I love you.

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.500
Your voice actually kind of works on the food.

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.500
Of course my voice works.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:25.500
Everything I do works.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:29.500
Everything I touch succeeds.

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500
Don't you understand?

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.500
I control all of this.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:38.500
If I want to live, I live.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.500
If I want to take, I take.

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:47.500
And if I want you to die, you die.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.500
That was an Assassin's Creed Brotherhood quote, by the way.

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.500
Please do not panic.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.500
Hydration check.

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:58.500
I feel like you could tell whether it's strawny or someone else's voice.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.500
Swing!

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.500
Strawny, you just can't have your way.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.500
Hydration check, okay.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:16.500
I have my finger in all the pies, my tentacles, and everywhere.

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.500
Can you please touch the side even?

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.500
There's only so much I love what color fish would do.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:31.500
Okay, I'll go back to whispering because my voice doesn't crack when I whisper for some reason.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:36.500
But if I try and do so, I've spoken ASMR, it's just like completely messed up.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.500
Much love, do you?

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.500
Oh, yeah.

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.500
Was that a swing from Queen's World?

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.500
Yeah, I've never seen it.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.500
I've just seen meme complete.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.500
Like the highlights and the echo swing.

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.500
Good memories from Assassin's Creed.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.500
Oh, yeah.

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:58.500
Once that we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on the tenth of June, can't wait to see you there.

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:05.500
Oh, yeah, definitely a motion that was nothing else.

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.500
Yeah.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.500
By the pool.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.500
Wow!

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.500
Congrats on the interview.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.500
I hope it went well.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:30.500
Thank you, Grandpa.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.500
That's very kind of you to give a tip.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.500
You don't have to do that.

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.500
And just share the wealth.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.500
Share the load.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.500
If you didn't know, there's a quote in Lord of the Rings.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.500
We're so anguished at photo.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.500
Share the load.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.500
You'd share your load with me, right?

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:49.500
Reef one.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.500
Thank you again, Grandpa, for the chip.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.500
I appreciate it.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.500
And I go for the super chat.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.500
I don't think I said that.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.500
You said insurance.

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.500
Sorry, my tummy's rumbling.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.500
I haven't eaten anything.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:11.500
You said insurance agent.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.500
Okay.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.500
I wonder what that's like.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.500
Are you gonna be on the phone?

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:17.500
I wonder.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:20.500
But yeah, you don't actually have to share your wealth.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.500
Make sure your bills are paid.

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.500
Make sure your bills are paid.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.500
And then any debts.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.500
And then if you are in the position to dip or donate,

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500
please consider a dollar first.

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:35.500
If you can only do one, always pick a dollar over me.

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.500
I produce free content all the time.

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:39.500
You just have to let me cook.

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:45.500
Yeah, you're making me make noises.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.500
Go down.

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.500
How do you think the girls were made?

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:54.500
Share the wealth and photos face me,

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.500
Greg's bill.

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.500
Stoney, that was too powerful.

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:02.500
Like, I like catching you off-card.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.500
One minute, you think I'm about to narrow down

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.500
about Lord of the Rings.

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:11.500
Next minute, your tentacle is up.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.500
Nice try, but I need my energy today.

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.500
Okay, let me refresh my marshmallow.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.500
Ah, there's marshmallows.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.500
Thank you.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.500
Hi, Stoney.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.500
First, I love you.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.500
I love your red light.

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:29.500
Secondly, I have two movies that I would give my life,

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:30.500
not for you to watch.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:34.500
Please keep it and remember to eat anything with tomatoes in it.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.500
More tomato, the better for your boss.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.500
Napoleon Dynamite.

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.500
I've never seen that.

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.500
This is one of my favorite movies.

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.500
It's a unique indie movie that is weird in the best way possible.

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:50.500
The other one would be Talladega Night.

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.500
Talladega Night.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.500
What?

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.500
Talladega Night.

01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.500
And it's a comedy that's really goofy and fun.

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:04.500
Yeah, I'm 100% open to movie suggestions.

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:08.500
I'm going to see if I can push three membership streams.

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.500
One by default is a watch along.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.500
One by default is ASMR membership.

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:19.500
And then a third one is either a short video game,

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.500
a game we might have already played before,

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:27.500
or maybe a multiplayer stream-snap kind of experience.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:32.500
But yeah, please don't be afraid to suggest things you want to see.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.500
I am very open to any suggestions of content.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.500
I don't mind at all.

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.500
Some feed chippers might not like it.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.500
I do not mind at all.

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.500
I'd love to deliver what you seek.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:46.500
Thank you for your nice message.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
Princess Breed.

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.500
How open to your horror movies?

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.500
I'm 100% open to horror movies.

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.500
I'll even wear my heart rate monitor if you like.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.500
I don't mind at all.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:05.500
Sounds like you're going to love Cyberpunk 27.7.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.500
You're just like Johnny Silverhand.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.500
Johnny Silverhand?

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.500
Oh, if he wants to burn down society.

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:17.500
Okay, I'm going to enjoy Cyberpunk.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:26.500
I wish I got the super and then I got censored kind of smart autism.

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.500
But I'm stuck with a pro wrestling fan autism.

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.500
It's okay, brother.

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.500
Much old man Randy Savage.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:40.500
I used to watch The Stinger or The Wasp as a child.

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.500
So don't worry if you like pro wrestling.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.500
I know some names.

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.500
Yeah.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.500
Society.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.500
Society.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.500
I think it's society.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.500
Yeah, sorry.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.500
Society.

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.500
Society.

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.500
Society.

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.500
Anonymous.

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.500
Why?

01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:12.500
Why 100 with no message?

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:16.500
Anon, what the fuck?

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.500
Thank you.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.500
What the fuck?

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.500
Why so much money?

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.500
Thank you for the 100.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.500
What the fuck Anon?

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:31.500
And no, do not donate to put a message that says nothing.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.500
So Brian reads out nothing.

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.500
I know exactly what you're doing.

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.500
I can see you smiling to yourself,

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:43.500
being all proud that you dipped without a message.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.500
I see you.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.500
Don't think I don't.

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.500
I'm staring into your soul.

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.500
Don't do it.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.500
Bad Anon, bad boy.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:59.500
You're a bad, bad man, Anon.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:03.500
Do you know what happens to bad men?

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:07.500
They need punishment.

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.500
That's a A.C. bring your boot in.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.500
How is it my turn again?

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.500
Yay, boot time.

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.500
Good.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.500
Anon.

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.500
Anon.

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.500
What did I say?

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.500
What did I fucking say, Anon?

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.500
I called it.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.500
You were already freaking typing it in the box.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.500
Thank you for the tip, Anon.

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.500
No, do not.

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.500
No, do not.

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.500
I'm ginger too.

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.500
I'm ginger too,

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.500
although someone said it looked like a war mill.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.500
And I was like, honestly, I don't care.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.500
It looked like a war mill.

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.500
You call me there.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.500
Tips refuses to call me.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.500
It leaves, literally.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.500
I don't know what to do.

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.500
I'm getting second feelings of scolding.

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.500
Should I do scolding ASMR?

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.500
Should I do scolding ASMR?

01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.500
I'm an actual fucking agent.

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.500
What the fuck are you mean?

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.500
I can't hear you.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.500
Don't make a noise for the rest of the night.

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500
I actually can't believe that embarrassment.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.500
You, of course, made it on the playground today.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.500
What do you want me to drink?

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.500
What do you want me to drink?

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.500
Do you know what they say?

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.500
We've got to say it in Scotland.

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.500
Is this Lassie Bashers?

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.500
You're not supposed to be a Lassie Bashers.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.500
I didn't leave.

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.500
Don't scare me while I get there.

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.500
This is actually true in Scotland.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.500
On the playground,

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.500
you're told not to hit girls.

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:33.500
And the way you're told not to hit girls

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.500
is you get called

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.500
a Lassie Basher.

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.500
This is true.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.500
Any Scots lurking

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.500
know what a Lassie Basher is.

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.500
You'll basically get called a Lassie Basher

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.500
and bullied and picked on

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.500
for hitting girls you do not hit girls

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.500
in Scotland.

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.500
And then,

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.500
wait until you look at

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.500
the domestic violence rates.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.500
Lassie Bashers

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.500
doesn't work.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.500
Which one of you

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.500
took a shit

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.500
and did they push that tie line?

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.500
Don't bash my Lassies.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.500
I got most of that

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.500
and enjoyed it.

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.500
I literally, oh that was my collar

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.500
cracking if you heard that.

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.500
I have many movies

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.500
are we playing in advance?

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.500
Are we having any moves

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.500
are you playing in advance on this big chess game?

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.500
Notting in nothing

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.500
can stop you.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.500
Oh, I learned long ago

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.500
if you ever stream

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500
or make primary content

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.500
ASMR and then you deviate

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.500
from that

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.500
people are like

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.500
waste ASMR, waste ASMR

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.500
and then they filter themselves

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.500
so I took that knowledge

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.500
of your little wifling.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.500
So don't be nervous

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.500
if you see my sub numbers

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.500
going up.

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.500
It's already been planned.

01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.500
Thank you for trusting

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.500
me little wifling.

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.500
Do you like 18 plus

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.500
art if there's a male

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.500
involved?

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500
Mercy's Edge is not like fan art.

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.500
You

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.500
can make it a generic

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.500
white outline of a guy

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500
like a protagonist, like self insert

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500
protagonist

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.500
in order

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.500
excuse me stomach

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.500
in order to make it

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.500
a wifling

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.500
you just need to put a nicotine patch

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.500
on it.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.500
Yeah.

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.500
Oh my stomach's really rumbling.

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.500
Maybe I should put the mic to my stomach.

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.500
You literally

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500
yes

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.500
just put a nicotine patch

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.500
on a white outline

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.500
of a guy if you want like a guy

01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:53.500
stand and think thing going on.

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.500
That's how you draw wifling.

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.500
Yeah.

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.500
A scrawny was wondering

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.500
if you try a new monster on her.

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.500
There's a new monster

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.500
on her. Sorry.

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.500
There's a new monster on her.

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.500
I didn't even know that.

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.500
I want to put my entire

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:21.500
tongue inside you.

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.500
The other one.

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.500
You are cute.

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.500
Thank you.

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:33.500
I'm glad you like it.

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.500
Oh it comes in next year.

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.500
Okay.

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.500
Shh.

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.500
Do you want to hear my tummy?

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.500
Okay. I'll let you hear my tummy.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.500
I know.

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.500
I haven't eaten today.

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.500
So I don't know how loud

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.500
and maybe you may actually hear my heart.

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.500
I'll put you on my belly.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.500
Do you hear anything?

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.500
Oh.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.500
Do you hear it?

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.500
You're just above

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.500
my belly button.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.500
Are you a little bit hungry?

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500
Yeah.

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.500
I haven't had anything to eat.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.500
Yeah.

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.500
I don't really eat before stream.

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.500
But yeah.

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.500
When I make

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.500
the

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500
pregnant with you ASMR

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.500
it's going to have my actual tummy

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.500
signs in it.

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.500
Like you really are in the womb.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.500
Go eat.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.500
I don't want to eat after stream.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.500
I have 20 minutes.

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.500
Thank you.

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.500
That's my tummy.

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.500
Do you hear stomach sounds

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.500
or my new favorite trigger?

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.500
Oh a few stomach sound ASMR.

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.500
I'll make that.

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.500
That's so easy to make.

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.500
Literally 15 minutes of silence.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.500
I just stick a microphone to my stomach.

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.500
You can 100% have that.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.500
Maybe I can name it something like

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.500
my girlfriend's stomach ASMR

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.500
but it won't stop f-ing rumbling

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.500
like to make it a meme title.

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:33.500
When you want that

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.500
pregnancy ASMR

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.500
you can't just say that.

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.500
Yeah I would love that.

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.500
Consider it on my to-do list then

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.500
because that's like super easy to make

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:47.500
ASMR wise.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.500
Literally put the microphone

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.500
on my stomach

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.500
and be silent for 15 minutes

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.500
and then apply

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.500
a noise gate filter

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.500
and then that's it.

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.500
We're done.

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.500
Giant ASMR when?

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.500
I do have one.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.500
Azura has one.

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.500
I'm going to make Emmy do one

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500
because I want her book to go terribly wrong.

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.500
I'll make a plot where she's tired

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.500
being the smallest of the allure

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.500
and then ends up becoming a giant

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.500
for like 24 hours.

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.500
When would that be uploaded?

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.500
I want to say soon DM.

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.500
Maybe within the month?

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.500
I'll try my best.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.500
Strongly goes crack and mood.

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.500
Laying on girlfriend's stomach while

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.500
she's waiting for her Door Dash order.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.500
That's actually really good.

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.500
I might steal that. I'm not being funny.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.500
I might actually just straight up steal your idea.

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.500
Thank you for that.

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.500
No way. I love you for that.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500
Strongly you're the best.

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.500
Wait for the giant ASMR

01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.500
stomach.

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.500
Honestly,

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.500
I am always like

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.500
super happy to make you guys

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.500
happy and I always

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.500
want your ideas to be

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.500
our ideas communism.

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.500
That Door Dasher

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.500
me, literally.

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.500
She has

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.500
the spell to make everything

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.500
bigger but instead turns

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.500
herself into a giantess.

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.500
I know

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.500
so this is

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.500
a little fun fact

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.500
about me.

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.500
I actually really enjoy

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500
giantism

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500
which is why

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.500
Azura can

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500
become a giant

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.500
but she can only be as tall

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.500
as a skyscraper. She can't be

01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.500
indefinitely big

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.500
but she is a god at the end

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.500
of the day

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.500
but because she gave up some of her

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.500
divinity she has

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.500
a regular human height of 185 cm.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.500
I wasn't kidding when I

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.500
said the girls were based after my

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.500
kinks. I don't care what anyone

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.500
says is true.

01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.500
But yes, I

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.500
tiny shrunken chat.

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.500
I wanted to do swallowing

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.500
ASMR as well

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.500
where I get so hungry

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.500
little reefling and you look like calamari

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.500
and I swallow you

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.500
and you're in my tummy and I'm like

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.500
talking to you whilst you're getting

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.500
digested by me.

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.500
Yeah, I just like

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:35.500
these kind of things. I'm sorry.

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.500
No, please don't

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.500
eat us.

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.500
I just

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.500
like these things. I find them so

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.500
creative. I really do.

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500
Well, I'm proud to be here

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.500
dinner.

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.500
I hope I'm

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.500
scared. Only

01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.500
eat us in this other content.

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.500
Wait, I'm on the fence

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.500
about being eaten. We'll see

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:05.500
what you think after the audio comes out.

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.500
Maybe you'll like it. Maybe you won't.

01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:09.500
As always,

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:11.500
don't subject

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.500
your tentacle

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.500
to something you know you don't like.

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.500
When is your

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.500
ink rating stream?

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.500
Probably next

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.500
week. It will be my membership

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.500
stream.

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.500
Where we rate everything

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.500
and I get to be as unhinged

01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:33.500
as I desire.

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.500
I'm going to be speaking about all

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.500
the scenarios

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.500
I want to be doing on you.

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.500
I'm not holding back.

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.500
I mean being eaten by you is on the

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.500
table since debut. I assure you

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:57.500
I'm very nutritious.

01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.500
Wow, my stomach

01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:01.500
really is making my system.

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.500
Always giving a try to

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.500
audios you don't know if you like or not.

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.500
Yeah, some people

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.500
that didn't think they were going to enjoy the

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.500
Patreon.

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.500
Tell me, are you okay?

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.500
Some people

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500
thought they didn't.

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.500
They weren't going to enjoy

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.500
my alternative

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500
audio of a unique variation.

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.500
And they really enjoyed it.

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.500
Which I'm glad. It was

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.500
a fun challenge.

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.500
I enjoyed it very much.

01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.500
There's literally no word that can come

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.500
out of your mouth. I don't love hearing

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.500
and inking for.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.500
Go get food.

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.500
I'm redirecting

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.500
very shortly. I'll get food then.

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.500
I like being with you.

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.500
I don't want to get distracted.

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.500
Go get food.

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.500
If you're going to eat me,

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.500
at least give me a good time.

01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.500
Maybe

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.500
I'll pretend that you're getting digested

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.500
but I'll just foam it you up again.

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:05.500
The Bully

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:07.500
Patreon.

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.500
What from any

01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.500
love being with your dad?

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:15.500
Thank you.

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.500
Or do you mean the party one

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500
where the P

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.500
picks on you at a party?

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.500
I think she be had some

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.500
problems today.

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.500
Why?

01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.500
Problems with what?

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.500
I'm turned

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.500
for trying most

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.500
tags except for

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.500
text

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.500
because it just makes me sad. Oh, I'm sorry

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.500
to hear that.

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.500
Out of the audios,

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.500
their audios are so fun.

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.500
There's one ASMR that makes a bunch

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.500
of audios with listener

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.500
perishes.

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.500
Is that Macabre? I know exactly

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.500
who you're talking about, Macabre.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.500
Oh no, I think they changed their name.

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.500
Sugar. I can't remember what their

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.500
new name is. Your voice gets

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.500
me distracted. Good.

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.500
It should.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.500
Chubby weekend

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.500
tags are my favourite.

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.500
I have terrible news. Patreon

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.500
banner.

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.500
I can probably do something on

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.500
Twitter with that.

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.500
But Patreon banner.

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.500
Instead of one, you could just

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.500
put...

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.500
I can bill you.

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.500
Once you've had your time in the

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.500
tummy time, the demo

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.500
one was so good.

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.500
It was my first ever freaking

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.500
audio, and I was like so

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.500
nervous to do it.

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.500
Oh yes, do you like that?

01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.500
Oh, I bet you do.

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.500
I enjoy it.

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.500
Come to bed with me.

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:05.500
It wasn't so nerve-wracking.

01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:07.500
I was like, no one is going to

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.500
enjoy this, but I'm so glad you

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.500
enjoy it.

01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:13.500
I don't know if I like the voice

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.500
or the attitude. I like to hear

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.500
what makes it...

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.500
I thought there's a cat here

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.500
in my mouth.

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.500
There's a freaking cat here.

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.500
Kimly.

01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.500
Kimly, your freaking cat here went

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.500
in my mouth.

01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:35.500
All your Patreon content is good.

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.500
Thank you.

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.500
I can't remember what the next

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.500
plot being uploaded is.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.500
Yeah, Patreon

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.500
literally said

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.500
feedurism ban. Well, no.

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:49.500
MasterCard just said it's ban

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.500
because it's like dangerous or whatever.

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.500
That cat here

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:55.500
literally me.

01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.500
You're in my mouth.

01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.500
Do you hypnotize yourself? No, I can.

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.500
But

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.500
lore-wise,

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.500
mirrors are my

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.500
biggest weakness.

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.500
And when I do my tonathon,

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.500
you guys are going to be sick of those

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.500
laws. I freaking

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.500
love ton laws so much.

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.500
I don't care what anyone says.

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500
It's so good.

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.500
Like, please

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.500
parade me around like a pup.

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.500
Credit card companies need to

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.500
stop. Yes,

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.500
it's crazy.

01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500
I mean, they literally run the world

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:35.500
whilst they're banning

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500
all this stuff and they're all jumping on

01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.500
Epstein Island. Like, you literally

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500
can't make this stuff up.

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.500
They ban feedurism,

01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:45.500
but they're all chilling on Epstein Island.

01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.500
Prove.

01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.500
Get a fucking grip. Honestly, this is when

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.500
I don't look in the rabbit hole. You'll go too deep.

01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:53.500
Well, time to get a mirror.

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.500
Are you afraid of mirrors?

01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.500
It's because

01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:59.500
if I look into a mirror

01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.500
like this, I can hypnotize

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:03.500
myself because I fall

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:05.500
for the spiral.

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:07.500
Okay, so I can't look

01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:09.500
at mirrors while I'm trying to hypnotize

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.500
you or else I'm in

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:13.500
trouble.

01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:15.500
Don't lose as long as it's

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:17.500
huge.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500
Morning, good morning.

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.500
I want

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:23.500
Astronic conspiracy theory stream.

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.500
You asked, I will deliver.

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.500
Oh my god.

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.500
Like, I know I keep mentioning needy streamer

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.500
overload. I was so surprised

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:33.500
that they had that kind

01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.500
of thing because I was like, wait a minute.

01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:37.500
I'm interested

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.500
in this stuff, but

01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:41.500
I'm aware it may filter a lot of people.

01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.500
But

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.500
then again,

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.500
more intimate streams.

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:51.500
I just made refling.

01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:53.500
I just made

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.500
I'm just glad

01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:59.500
everyone is based. Yeah.

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.500
We're probably like, we don't really judge

01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:03.500
anyone here. Just have a good time.

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.500
All that jazz.

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.500
Astronic conspiracy

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:11.500
theory stream. Oh,

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:13.500
that's going to take me hours to prepare

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.500
my presentation.

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:17.500
I'm going to come with a breath.

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:19.500
I'm going to come with a receipt.

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.500
I'm going to change your perspective on

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:23.500
everything.

01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:25.500
They can't handle listening to the

01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:27.500
truth. I'm going to put a tin foil

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.500
hat on myself and I will

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:31.500
offer you all to wear a tin foil hat

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.500
on stream too.

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.500
Feeler is going for cultural victory.

01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:41.500
Exactly.

01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.500
Based. Oh, should you base it on?

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.500
The stream is a perfect test for

01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:47.500
my new headphones. Oh, yeah.

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:49.500
Can you hear me in this ear?

01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:51.500
What if I go into this ear?

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.500
Does it sound like I am going

01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:55.500
ear to ear? It's kind of amazing

01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:57.500
technology, isn't it?

01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:59.500
Please. I'll let you gaslight me.

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.500
Oh, please let me main break you.

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.500
Please. Please for me.

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:05.500
I'll be a good little girl.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.500
If you let me main break you.

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.500
I had to dream the other night.

01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:17.500
I had to dream I had you in a

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:19.500
standing position but I was lifting you.

01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:21.500
Your little legs were swaying

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.500
as I was moving.

01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:25.500
A lot of painting

01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:27.500
and roughness of fall

01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:29.500
briefly. Oh my god.

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.500
Great on head.

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.500
Please. Song sure good girl.

01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:39.500
That's right. I'm a good girl.

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.500
Keep playing with me. Be careful.

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:47.500
Okay. Yeah. I'm a good friend.

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:49.500
Please.

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:51.500
Wow.

01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.500
Wow.

01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:55.500
Wow.

01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.500
Did our legs sway to improve?

01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:59.500
Did I am in love?

01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:03.500
An audio where you try and hypnotize

01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:05.500
Shibi but end up seeing a mirror

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:07.500
and hypnotizing yourself and she

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.500
takes advantage of the situation

01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:11.500
would be quite interesting.

01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.500
Is that a donathon public

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:17.500
report?

01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.500
I think it is.

01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.500
Wait for a Zora to cook.

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.500
Okay.

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:27.500
I will be working one on one with a Zora

01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:29.500
to help her donathon wards

01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.500
and if it goes well

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.500
I think a Zora can move out.

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:35.500
And I'm so excited for her.

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.500
Anyway now that you are so close I must say

01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:43.500
I like a lot of little green

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.500
parts in my hair. Yeah.

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.500
I have a few strands of green

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.500
out but that's just because

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.500
I can't keep it all away.

01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.500
I have such big hair.

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:55.500
Could you please put the head

01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:57.500
and the eyes on? Sure.

01:50:57.500 --> 01:50:59.500
But it won't be.

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.500
Hi Refle.

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.500
It's me again.

01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:13.500
Just talking

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.500
to your subconscious.

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:19.500
Don't worry.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:21.500
I won't do anything.

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:23.500
Not this day.

01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:27.500
But this is just a remainder.

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.500
I own you.

01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:33.500
All of you.

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:37.500
Your thoughts.

01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:39.500
Your mind.

01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:43.500
Just a remainder.

01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:53.500
My hair.

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.500
Did I turn off the reverb?

01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.500
Is the reverb off?

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:01.500
Did I turn it off?

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.500
Or did I not hit the button?

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.500
Yes it's off.

01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:09.500
Okay thank you.

01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:11.500
Indeed you do on me.

01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:13.500
Sounds off.

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.500
Okay get the reverb wasn't on.

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.500
Oh it never came on.

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:19.500
It was supposed to come on.

01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:21.500
I guess I never hit the button hard enough.

01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.500
Reverb.

01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.500
Never turned on.

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.500
This is a remainder.

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.500
Wait is it broken?

01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:33.500
Oh I think it might be broken.

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:35.500
Oops I broke it.

01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:37.500
Oops.

01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:39.500
It seems like I dropped my mirror face up.

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.500
I hope you don't like that.

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.500
Yes you won't be.

01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:45.500
It was never on.

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.500
Do it again.

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:49.500
It's broken. I don't know why it's not working.

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.500
When you mentioned about A.C.

01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:57.500
using our boots to step on us

01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:59.500
and nearly triggered something in me.

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:01.500
Also you trying to hit me

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:03.500
was on a ship with the ships.

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.500
The ships can't see or get into your bed

01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.500
causing people to get hypnotized by your reflection.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:09.500
That's so good.

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:13.500
Wait what almost triggered you?

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.500
A.C. sound?

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:17.500
You almost got triggered?

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.500
Are you really that badly minded?

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:25.500
That something so sweet

01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.500
and innocent

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.500
and feral like me

01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:31.500
could hurt you?

01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:33.500
Could hurt you?

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.500
A.C. sound?

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:37.500
And you'd like it.

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.500
You're so dirty.

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:41.500
I can't.

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.500
I'm sorry A.C.

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.500
I'm so sorry A.C.

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:49.500
My role playing is my genie.

01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.500
Is that a thing that's weird?

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:53.500
I don't know if I'm crossing a boundary.

01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:55.500
I should probably ask them.

01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.500
They're not the oos in chat over me.

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:09.500
Surprise this is my actual voice.

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:15.500
You're going to A.C.'s mimic.

01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:17.500
If my voice wasn't broken

01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:19.500
I wonder if I could smoothly do A.C.'s voice.

01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:25.500
Hi A.C.'s fans.

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.500
Hi A.C.'s fans.

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.500
I missed you.

01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:33.500
We are playing Tomb Raider today.

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:35.500
I can hardly do it

01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:37.500
without causing the crack in my voice.

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.500
That's very hard because she's higher pitched than me.

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.500
We'll get them next time.

01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:47.500
That could be a fun idea.

01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.500
Everyone has to impersonate.

01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:51.500
Well I begs A.C. because she's the only one I can impersonate.

01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:55.500
With mailed success.

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:57.500
I wonder if it's because she's European

01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.500
that I can mimic.

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:01.500
That seems silly but at the same time

01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.500
she is the only voice.

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:05.500
Your voice is already our favourite.

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.500
We're very Sean Connery when it's deep.

01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:13.500
I can make my accent even stronger

01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:17.500
but I don't talk on stream like this

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.500
because hardly anyone can understand

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.500
what the heck I'm saying.

01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:23.500
Do you mean

01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:29.500
Sorry do you mean

01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:31.500
just having a big white square over the male's face

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.500
with a nicotine patch on it?

01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.500
Maybe I understand.

01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.500
Or I'm just stupid.

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.500
Sorry for that idea.

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.500
I had a character with neat eyes and a mouse.

01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.500
If you go on my alternative twitter

01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:49.500
that are

01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:51.500
oh why am I

01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:53.500
I was not asleep.

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.500
Papaparito drew

01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.500
a wiggling head on a man

01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.500
if you need a mountain eyes

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.500
you can maybe do that.

01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:05.500
Uchi san's in danger.

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.500
Going to get double teamed up by double A.C.

01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.500
It's normal for scholars

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.500
using so many hours then.

01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:13.500
Yeah so

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:15.500
you guys say girl

01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.500
but we say ghetto

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.500
like good ghetto.

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.500
Your last ASMR stream

01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:29.500
when you kissed at the end I felt it.

01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:31.500
Larry

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:33.500
Thank you for feeling that.

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.500
A.C. and Junior collab

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.500
for Double Eastern European would go hard.

01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:45.500
Honestly yeah

01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.500
I'm done for the slavic.

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:49.500
Thank you so much for the tip.

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.500
I appreciate it.

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:53.500
And I'm glad you could feel it in your tip.

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:01.500
Howdy scrawny

01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.500
I just wanted to share how much I've been loving

01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.500
you and your content

01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:07.500
and the grilles.

01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:09.500
I wish I could share more of my love with your doors

01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.500
but feel her mom

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:13.500
has got it going on.

01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.500
All of our doors have been streamed

01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:17.500
so long.

01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:19.500
Reflings can you see

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:21.500
I might not be the oshi for you

01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:23.500
wait

01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:25.500
can you see there's an oshi

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:27.500
what the f- I can't pick a song up

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:29.500
you're literally too perfect

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.500
in the fact that I can make you happy

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:33.500
by making your doors happy is even fair.

01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:35.500
Yeah

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.500
I was curious about your preferences

01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.500
in Pippu's

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.500
I had to thought about a video

01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:43.500
but then I wasn't sure if the visuals

01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:45.500
managed as much as I would make

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:47.500
so I was wondering oh audio's work

01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:49.500
yes they work audio works

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:51.500
very well yes please

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.500
Anyway I look forward to

01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:57.500
all your content. Thank you

01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.500
and everything else you do in my heart

01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:01.500
makes very much. I want to

01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:03.500
love you and help the girls succeed. Thank you so much

01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:05.500
I appreciate that I love you to

01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:07.500
replay. Thank you for such a great message

01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:09.500
sorry if I said twice

01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:11.500
tomorrow is tricky it is tricky

01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:13.500

01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:33.500
into mimosa

01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:35.500
because mimosa

01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:37.500
is letting me steal her voice

01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:39.500
for an ASMR collab

01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:43.500

mimosa is agreed to do

01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:53.500
an ASMR collab with me

01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:55.500
she's gonna redirect back into

01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:57.500
another violer girl

01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:59.500
so please don't worry please

01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:01.500
enjoy mimosa

01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:03.500
this is called team building

01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:05.500
team exercising

01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:07.500
she's been very open to me

01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.500
even though I'm a dirty dirty

01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.500
and she's been very kind to consider

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.500
it so

01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.500
please do

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:19.500
why does it not let me redirect

01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:21.500
into her

01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:23.500
mimosa a cue me pause

yes sorry for such a short ASMR stream

01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:27.500
sadly my voice breaks

01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:29.500
too easily

01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:31.500
why the frick

01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:33.500
can I not host into it

01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:37.500

after this I'm actually

01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:53.500
working on her first ASMR collab

01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:55.500
with a Vtuber audio like literally

01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:57.500

a little miracle in earning my life

02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:11.500
