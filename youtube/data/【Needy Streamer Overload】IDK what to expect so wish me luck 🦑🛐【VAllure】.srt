1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
I'm trying my ankle.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,220
Wah.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,120
Wah.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,960
It's up.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,280
It's up.

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,360
I think it's up.

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,280
I've just built this freaking game and the music.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,360
Oh my gosh.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,280
Are you there?

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,360
Hopefully I'm live.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,400
I know I've started like nine minutes early,

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,880
but I'm just sitting here and I'm like,

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,080
I don't want to wait the nine minutes

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,000
for when I'm supposed to start my stream time.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,080
I just want to start now.

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,120
So I'm starting now.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,720
I just need to make sure I can see I'm live

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,160
and then I can close my stream.

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,520
Okay, yeah, it says I'm live.

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,280
I'm so sorry I've been boozled.

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,800
Yes, I put in the wrong day.

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,400
I put in the wrong hour.

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,480
Shocking behavior.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,760
I have the most kind of like saddest start

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,440
to a stream so far.

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,640
I got on Marshmallow, but sadly due to text,

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,400
I cannot see what the tone is behind

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
and I've read the Marshmallow as like a veiled threat

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,240
or something, but I just want to say

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,720
to the person who sent me a cat picture link,

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,680
like an actual picture of a cat.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,080
I don't know how to break this to you.

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,080
I got my payloads in March after a very rough time

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,920
where I realized that life was too short.

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,280
I've not owned a pet, okay, since then

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,360
and my payloads came into my life in March.

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,760
So please, like, I don't know if it was like

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,640
a weird threat thing going on

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,480
and I know for literally everyone else,

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,160
this makes no sense.

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,800
But I can't read tone in a text

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,960
and it looked like a weird veiled threat

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,960
and I just like, I got my payloads in March.

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,920
And yeah, I don't know what to tell you.

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,200
Like I've visited America as a child at nine years old.

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,920
I don't live in America.

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,280
I don't know what's going on.

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,600
So you identified yourself as not a reefling.

49
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,200
So if it's all good, I'm just gonna, you know,

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,120
stream here with my reeflings and we're gonna do our thing.

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,960
Hopefully it wasn't actually a threat,

52
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,920
but if it was, then hey-ho, I've addressed it

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,920
and I've negated what your evidence was purely

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
on the basis that I got Gimli and Vigo in March

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,760
and that's when I got my payloads.

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,560
So yeah, I apologize for that

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,400
making absolutely no sense to literally everyone else,

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,640
but good morning, good evening, and good afternoon.

59
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,280
It is a wild ride.

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,800
You play two games of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

61
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,440
I'm literally not even on my third game stream.

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,280
I've never done a second game stream variation.

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,160
And it's like, oh, I don't think it's a threat,

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,840
but at the same time, my brain's telling me

65
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,560
it's a veiled threat, so I'm just gonna address it that way.

66
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,960
If you didn't mean it, sure, but as I said,

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,360
I don't live in America.

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,320
I have two cats that I got in March.

69
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,120
They were adopted and yeah, I don't know what else

70
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,960
to tell you, bro.

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,720
I'd just appreciate if you left me alone

72
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,360
and I'll just be having fun with my reeflings.

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,840
So thanks.

74
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Don't do that again.

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,520
Yes, anyway, now that we've got that part over, Jesus.

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,720
A little bit of a restless sleep.

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,280
May or may not have had diarrhea

78
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,160
because I can't tell context.

79
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,160
However, we're gonna be playing a game

80
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,000
called Needy Streamer Overload.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I just opened it up and it gave me a kind of Windows XP thing.

82
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,400
Windows Vista was like before me.

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,760
I'm like, oh, 99% sure.

84
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Wait, Windows Vista.

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Like, I don't think I even had, like, wait, when, when,

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,080
wait, this is Windows Vista, no, I think Windows Vista

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,240
when released it.

88
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,760
Oh, would my dad have had that on the console?

89
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Well, let's give it a Windows Vista or Windows 98.

90
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,440
I don't know what version of Windows, okay?

91
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,400
So we're gonna have a shot at this game.

92
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
I don't know what to expect.

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,280
Now, a few reflings told me yesterday that for a factoid,

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,280
this game apparently has over 500 different endings

95
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,840
or I made that number up

96
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,480
because someone said the game had a ton of endings.

97
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,240
Now, this is gonna be a shorter stream today,

98
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,760
but the good news with it being a shorter stream

99
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,760
is I might be able to release my first ASMR,

100
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,200
like 1K thank you audio, like today,

101
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,520
but I need to go edit it, but it's gonna be, like, fun

102
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,360
and it's clean, it's, like, clean ASMR.

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,280
Like, it's literally me just rambling

104
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,720
and, like, tapping away on stuff

105
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,680
and all that kind of thing, so it's cute.

106
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,600
Oh, just, yeah, just a short nine hour stream today.

107
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,960
I'm sure you can strap in the lads and lasses,

108
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,680
don't you worry.

109
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,080
Yeah, only seven are, yeah, easy peasy lemme squeeze there.

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
I was actually thinking Skyrim,

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,680
I've put down Skyrim as two, 12 back to back.

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,120
I don't know if I should purposely wake up

113
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,520
right before stream for the Skyrim

114
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,120
and then make a second room

115
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,280
and then we'll do, like, 12 hours

116
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,600
and then in the second room another four hours

117
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,560
and then I think the following day, that 12 hour stream,

118
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,000
I can complete the full achievements.

119
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,920
I'm not 100% sure.

120
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,640
I do have a honey tea with me, though,

121
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,320
so hopefully you have some water, some snackies.

122
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
And all that jazz.

123
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,160
But, yes, next week our endurance stream

124
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,160
is going to be Skyrim

125
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,960
and we're also doing an endurance runescape,

126
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,160
old school runescape.

127
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,640
I will tell you what world to be in.

128
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,600
I am going to start on a fresh account.

129
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
I am going to buy premium in runescape

130
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,920
but we'll get to that when we get to that, you know what I mean?

131
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,360
So let's stream into it.

132
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,600
Yeah, I'm a bit of a fiend for streaming.

133
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,480
I really enjoy it.

134
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,280
Like, some people, like, due to their circumstances,

135
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,720
like, they can't stream every day

136
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,520
or they find it a bit harder,

137
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,320
like, and mentally it takes its toll.

138
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,160
Me?

139
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,400
Like, I'm about to freaking try out this crazy game

140
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,440
for the first time.

141
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,800
I don't know much about it.

142
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,560
Apparently you can do implied scenes in it,

143
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
so I'm like, all right, all right, here we go, here we go.

144
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
So I'm interested.

145
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,920
I don't know if it should just get straight into it.

146
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
You guys can hear it, it's not too loud.

147
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,120
I was worried about the music being too loud.

148
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,000
I can almost turn it off on my end, but yeah.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,520
Yeah, some streamers, like, kinda just do it circumstances

150
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,280
but I just seem to have the perfect mesh

151
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,920
of, like, missing brain cells here,

152
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,680
a bit of a smooth brain here,

153
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,520
a bit more of a complex surface area

154
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,920
at the section of my brain.

155
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,360
Music's actually a bit quiet, right?

156
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,240
Okay, it's just loud in my headset.

157
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Okay.

158
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,760
I've turned off a bit.

159
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,520
I'm a wee bit close to my mic, but, right.

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh, it's got a little love heart.

161
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,640
See that, so Mersey was theorized that her heart,

162
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,520
right, this is what I theorized when Mersey thingied.

163
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,600
Mersey's pupils are normal

164
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,400
before her first experience as a yandere occurred

165
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,720
and then her pupils broke

166
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,400
and she can no longer love appropriately.

167
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Like, the concept doesn't exist for her.

168
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,920
If you look back in Amy's lore video,

169
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,080
you'll notice she, her pupils are normal

170
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,240
until she picks up that book.

171
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,400
They have little small details.

172
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,840
Obviously my pupils have always been

173
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,160
a little cuddle fishes.

174
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,120
She's broken.

175
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,480
I started to think that if someone is a beacher

176
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,240
within the entire brain, it's just soup.

177
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,120
Honestly, I would happily join the study data group thing.

178
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,800
You can hook me up because I can prove that I'm pretty dumb.

179
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,720
Like, yeah.

180
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
I didn't think to pay attention.

181
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,400
No, there's like little small details

182
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,720
like in everyone's lore.

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,680
Like, you know,

184
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,680
AC has scars from the polar bear that she destroyed

185
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,560
and then she raised Feral

186
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,720
and like kind of like all kind of plays back into it.

187
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,960
Like for AC's audio work, she's actually,

188
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,640
hey, this is gonna sound terrible.

189
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,560
I'm so sorry.

190
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,640
This is gonna sound terrible.

191
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,640
In my experience, if there is ever an audio produced

192
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,240
where you the listener may or may not be taking,

193
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,600
have been taken by the band page of,

194
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,600
by the female performer, it always goes down really well.

195
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,560
And I consented AC with the idea

196
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,440
that she doesn't know what Bincent is.

197
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,760
She doesn't know what Bincent is.

198
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
So she just jumps on you basically.

199
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,920
No prior warning because she was raised Feral.

200
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,760
So it's not a thing.

201
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,400
Like if you're a bear, you grab what you want instantly.

202
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,240
You wanna eat?

203
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,440
Okay, let's go down to the river.

204
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
You wanna climb this tree?

205
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
Heck yeah, let's climb this tree.

206
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,840
So yeah, and I kind of made her like that.

207
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I've not made her do anything like that,

208
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,880
but it's just kind of like a small detail

209
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,920
because everyone's like,

210
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,720
oh, this brat needs correction,

211
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,400
or like, oh, G-San, you can't keep up.

212
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,120
And it's kind of interesting to see that dynamic form

213
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,800
because the dynamic in my head was like,

214
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,800
she completely has you wrapped around her claw type thing

215
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,480
and she does what she wants to do, which is so terrible.

216
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,040
But look, this is a fun thing about like going from concept

217
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,400
to actually what's happening now.

218
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Like as I said, girls, I've full control type thing going on.

219
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,160
My update for YouTube monetization,

220
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,920
my statistics have updated and we've been told,

221
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,640
like I can see on my YouTube that I've met the watch hour,

222
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,120
but if I go to apply for monetization,

223
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,560
it says I've only got 88 hours watch time

224
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,760
and I'm like, right, it's been four days.

225
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,600
I would like to apply for it now.

226
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,120
Like I don't have no idea why it's taken

227
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,000
so long to update, it's crazy.

228
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm going to take a sipping tin of my tea

229
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
and then we'll see what this game provides.

230
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,600
So I am warning you, it is a shorter stream today.

231
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,120
However, I do think Shibi is coming on in two hours.

232
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
I think AC is having a rest day.

233
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,320
Shibi and me, is it a rest day for Azura?

234
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,960
I think Azura does double back rest days.

235
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
What kind of tea?

236
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,040
It's always the same tea.

237
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,080
But Ash, like I think it's called black tea

238
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,840
or English breakfast tea, either variation with honey.

239
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,960
For once having a tough time sleeping is a good thing.

240
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,640
No, Azura is an ASMR.

241
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,880
Oh my gosh, she's an ASMR today.

242
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,280
Oh, I'm so excited for Azura's ASMR.

243
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,560
Please give her lots of tips unironically.

244
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880
Oh well, in three ways.

245
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,680
Monetary, your advice, and the other.

246
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,280
She's so nervous, but I know she's going to do perfect.

247
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,480
Like imagine listening, I can hear it now.

248
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,920
Imagine that voice going from ear to ear and her kisses.

249
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,760
Oh, and I hope she hugs me.

250
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,520
I need to, I've not told her to,

251
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,000
like I don't tell anyone what to do,

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,600
but if she hugs the mic, heart beat, Azura, heart beat.

253
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,880
Heartbeat and kisses ASMR from Azura.

254
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,360
Yeah, I'm there, I'm already on cloud nine,

255
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,520
I don't know what to tell you.

256
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
I don't know what to tell you.

257
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,400
Also, I may have infected Azura and Shibi.

258
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,920
They said they might play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

259
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,880
at a later time, because I've inspired them

260
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,080
and they've read my mind about playing the games.

261
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm going to be fangirling so hard

262
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,880
if I get to watch them play Brotherhood.

263
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,600
But good morning, good evening, good afternoon,

264
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,240
or good time zone, like that one we fling said.

265
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,960
No better feeling than chilling your childhood game.

266
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,120
Bro, literally, I feel like I didn't know

267
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
Azura played that game,

268
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,800
because she spoke a lot of like watching anime in her 2.0.

269
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,400
So I was like, oh okay, like on a scale of gamer to weave,

270
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,040
I'd say she was weave type thing, and yeah.

271
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,000
We aren't real we flings, YouTube is telling on us.

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,240
Evening, let's spread the AC love.

273
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,320
Oh yeah, spreads my AC all over your face.

274
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,680
So Johnny, you've made me want to re-play Ezio.

275
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,480
Oh, it's so good, oh.

276
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,600
We are going to revisit in Octogre,

277
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,640
but my morning has been good,

278
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,040
my pants have been shat successfully.

279
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Oh, I never got Marshmallow from a fart in the toilet, Anon.

280
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
I don't think he's here anymore,

281
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,440
I think we lost him in the great cryo chamber, unfortunately.

282
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,720
But literally, I think Amy started her stream yesterday,

283
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,680
and she was like, I shoulda dida dida dida,

284
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,480
and I shoulda dida dida this morning,

285
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
because I got a really weird Marshmallow,

286
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,560
and I'm like, I don't want to freaking upset

287
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,400
or offend anyone or anything like that.

288
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
And I'm like, I can't read context,

289
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,680
so my brain's like, is someone threatening me?

290
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,040
Ah, I don't know.

291
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,960
But yeah, bizarre, bizarre.

292
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,560
Rip to every one, pants shitted.

293
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,880
Honestly, it was fucking weak again,

294
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,360
I'm not being funny, but it was absolutely,

295
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,200
you know what, you know what,

296
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,880
it's a British word that I don't use often at all,

297
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,200
but I saw it in a TikTok recently.

298
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,880
That's Pongin, like P-O-N-G-E-D,

299
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,400
Pongin, Pongin, Pong, so smells.

300
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,160
It's such a bizarre word.

301
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,920
I don't say that, I'm just like, I just,

302
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,280
that's Rikin, we say Rikin, R-E-E-K-I-N-G.

303
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,040
Rikin, Pongin, oh, honestly, that sounds Dutch.

304
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,160
Pongin, junga, alo, yay, mooroo.

305
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,920
Mengen, oh yeah, Mengen, Rikin.

306
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
I say Rikin for smell, I think Mengen's like,

307
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,720
more disgust, but Rikin is for smell.

308
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,200
And British, you've never heard that, Pongin,

309
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,320
like when it Pongs, I wonder if it's an older word.

310
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,400
My gran, my gran, I think she said, oh, that's Pongin.

311
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,480
Although she made me laugh one time,

312
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,480
she calls farts Windy Pops, and I was like,

313
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,720
and I burst out laughing, I've never heard of any

314
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,120
like refer to as Windy Pops before,

315
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,840
and I'm like, oh, okay.

316
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,080
I was like, it's so polite and so British,

317
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,640
like if we end up getting a British fridge in too,

318
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,120
I'm making her say like, ooh, Windy Pops,

319
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,440
like in our wee English accent.

320
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320
I was saying that we could get a Welsh,

321
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,720
or a Northern Irish, Irish, but sometimes Northern Irish

322
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,760
don't really wanna be referred to as British, you know,

323
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,640
and in which I completely respect and understand,

324
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,680
like let's not get into it, wait until you learn,

325
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
wait until we do the history stream

326
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,560
of why the Irish famine, potato famine,

327
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,560
wasn't actually real, thanks to the British Empire, yahoo.

328
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,560
It's ridiculous, but yes, if you didn't know,

329
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,240
a lot of Irish migrated to America,

330
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,160
a lot of Irish migrated to Scotland,

331
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,320
to different parts, to in search of working food,

332
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,680
which is why a lot of you are like,

333
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,520
I'm one eighth Scottish, I'm one eighth Irish type thing.

334
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,080
Heck yeah you are,

335
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,760
because that's how mass migration works,

336
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,120
so you know that one eighth Scottish in you,

337
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,080
that's right, I'm in you right now,

338
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm in your blood supply, I'm beating around there,

339
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,920
I'm seeking things in your body,

340
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
because you're like one sixteenth Scots.

341
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,360
As a British person, a lot of things were up for.

342
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Well England, with its sanctions on Scotland.

343
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,040
Please don't take the strunnies in me, oh yeah.

344
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,960
I thought it was meant to be the other way around,

345
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,280
look it works both ways here, that's all I'm saying,

346
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,400
look some people didn't like it, I respect that, okay?

347
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,760
All I'm saying, if I had some sort of sensory organ,

348
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,400
it would give me more of a reason to explore even more.

349
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,720
One fourth Scottish, let's move, actually.

350
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,800
What percent campfire will we tolerate?

351
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,280
I see the most common.

352
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,640
I have three percent strunnie in me, there we go.

353
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,640
The potato famine was not fun for Ireland.

354
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,840
Well wait until you learn even more about the issues.

355
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,240
Maybe we can do an education stream about it,

356
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,080
but I don't want it to be like hate,

357
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,080
because I assure you any English twat the day

358
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,280
did not have any bearing on the famine, many a minute ago.

359
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
But I don't mind doing historical education streams,

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,720
and the reason why Ireland kentatized them with Scotland

361
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,840
is because there was mass migration due to that,

362
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,720
so I don't mind a cheeky education stream once in a while.

363
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,480
I've actually really always enjoyed academics,

364
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,800
sadly the social sides of academics,

365
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,480
I may have failed that part, but I've always enjoyed it.

366
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I'm actually going back to college soon,

367
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,040
which I'm excited to talk about.

368
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,800
Not now though, man's trying to run a business,

369
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,640
you know what I'm saying?

370
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,560
Well, I say that, I'm actually passing off it,

371
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,600
so it's everyone else's problem, but man.

372
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,840
But I am thinking of doing beauty school,

373
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,600
beauty school, but listen, hear me out,

374
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,000
beauty school dropout, that's a grease thing.

375
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,760
The reason why I'm doing beauty school

376
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,400
is because I want to get a certificate

377
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,400
to possibly open up a little, so you might not know this,

378
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,800
you know in salons, they have a spare room,

379
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,280
these rooms can be rented out for whatever you want,

380
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,280
and I was just thinking on the idea,

381
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,080
when time progresses, things do their thing,

382
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,960
I might have a pop up at a little ASMR shop,

383
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
but it's just a little bed in the room,

384
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,120
and it would just be so fun, and I love it,

385
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,600
because I am genuinely passionate about ASMR.

386
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,480
I love the stuff about it,

387
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,400
I've tried to research some of the psychology,

388
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,800
I've came up with my own theories,

389
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,280
not everyone agrees with my theories,

390
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,840
but that's because it's just what it is,

391
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,440
but I think it would be a lot better.

392
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,360
V sucky salon, right, you're done, you're done, you're done.

393
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,520
Honestly, the skills you've learned

394
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,600
running a business is worth a lot,

395
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,280
much more than the MBA.

396
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Well, you see skills, but literally,

397
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm at the process where I'm about to hand

398
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,560
everything off now, like I'm so freaking happy,

399
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,840
and the only thing I need to worry about is clippers,

400
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,360
and there's the possibility, for those of you

401
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,360
who have an oh-she-desk and editing skills of the girls,

402
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,600
I am 100% open, like once things settle,

403
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,040
because I know it takes a while to kind of settle

404
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,280
on an oh-she-desk and be like, oh yeah, shit,

405
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,240
yeah, I'm gonna watch her consistently.

406
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,280
If you have the time, and if you're an editor,

407
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,680
I am very open, if you wanted to be a dedicated clipper

408
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,520
or highlight editor for that girl,

409
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,480
you're welcome to email the website.

410
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,520
Just to tell you right now, no,

411
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,320
you do not get a open communication with a girl,

412
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,400
everything is done through IWL messages,

413
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
but yeah, if you really enjoy one of the girls

414
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,160
and you wanna clip them, or do highlight streams,

415
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,560
or funny moments type thing, and wanna get paid for it,

416
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,680
hit the website up, because it saves me even more time,

417
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,800
because right now I'm, today after the short stream,

418
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,640
I'm going to edit my 1K, thank you ASMR,

419
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,920
and then upload that, and then I'm gonna send away

420
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,280
a few more clips for editing, because the second guy

421
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,160
we've got, poor guy, I've left him on red

422
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,600
for like six days now, and I'm like, oops, but yeah.

423
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,040
I'm definitely gonna have to find a few more clippers,

424
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,120
I probably wanna try two more clippers, but yeah.

425
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,240
You don't like Vsucky, so you'd say that Vsucky blows,

426
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,400
honestly, shawty, shawty.

427
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,960
But yes, there's opportunities,

428
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,600
please don't think that this is a super closed off thing,

429
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm happy to tell you about what the process is like

430
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,280
when it comes to clips, the reason why

431
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,600
subtitles kinda jump at you in clips,

432
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,000
is because that's what gets the monkey side of your brain

433
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,800
to like keep watching.

434
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,720
The editor for Mercy's recent clip,

435
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,240
I forgot to put credit in the blonde one,

436
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,920
you can edit credit in the description.

437
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,760
Right, I need to do that,

438
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,160
Mercy has a new short coming out,

439
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,880
and the editing style is just,

440
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,720
captures the ADHD perfectly,

441
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,320
it has insider knowledge about VTubers,

442
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,200
like I'm just really happy with it,

443
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,200
so if you can edit what Mercy's recently published clips

444
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,040
are like, feel free to hit the website up,

445
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,400
I'm needing a few more clippers.

446
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,720
I'm needing to get,

447
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,560
Sheeby needs clips very badly, I need to put up.

448
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,640
However,

449
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,800
there's like so many little notes I'm like,

450
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,320
so I've told the girls to cover up your

451
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,040
for now, like as you can see,

452
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,840
you can only see my deckliotage at the moment,

453
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,880
because I'm a bit worried about

454
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,120
what the heck's going on with YouTube right now.

455
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,200
I feel like there's still policy updates going,

456
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,040
but that's just me.

457
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,240
But right, let me finish this team,

458
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,360
we'll actually jump into the game,

459
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,440
because I have been yapping for 20 minutes,

460
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,360
I'm not even, oh that's ridiculous, sorry, I'm so sorry.

461
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,960
Goodness gravy, once I get started,

462
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,360
I can't even stop, 20 freaking two minutes.

463
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,680
That is terrible.

464
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,320
Are you looking for clippers?

465
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,640
Mm, if you look on Mercy's most recent short,

466
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,480
if you can do clips like that, that's pre-made stuff,

467
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,600
where I just send you the model and the audio,

468
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,000
and then you do the subtitling and all the other fancy,

469
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,840
like,

470
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,720
then yes, definitely apply.

471
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,520
If you mean clipping highlight sections in general,

472
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,600
again, I'm gonna see what happens after Gelt's stream.

473
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,960
Ah, okay, I finished my tea.

474
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,200
I came for the yapping, honestly.

475
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,040
Don't worry, there was two points,

476
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,560
I was like half yapping, but it was so fun.

477
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes.

478
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,600
Okay, what is this game about?

479
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,480
Good question, I actually don't know.

480
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,720
So all I know is it's called Needy Streamer Overload.

481
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,440
I believe it is one girl,

482
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,400
and there's a ton of different endings

483
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,080
that we can potentially get,

484
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,800
so we're gonna check it out, see how it is.

485
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,440
I believe it's a click simulator,

486
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,280
so I can't get annoyed at the gameplay,

487
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,440
because this is my kind of thing,

488
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,440
like, nice chill, doing my thing.

489
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,120
Vealur, where the company competition

490
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,160
is actually just who's the biggest yapper, honestly.

491
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,320
20 minute talking, no gameplay, if you can show me.

492
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,120
Honestly, this game is a feature for Life Simulator.

493
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,960
Is it actually?

494
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Okay, that's good, that's good.

495
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,160
I was gonna play YouTube Simulator,

496
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,160
and then I was gonna call it like, well, Vealur fail.

497
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Okay, okay, so there's day progressions, okay?

498
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,880
Okay, you ready?

499
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,840
Welcome, day one of five.

500
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Man, wait, no.

501
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,240
Got the stream account, time to log in and get ready.

502
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,640
Click on stream and log in with my,

503
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,640
thank you for the tip, Joshua Jones, 22.

504
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,560
Oh, there's a cat, oh my god.

505
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,760
Meow, meow.

506
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,440
Click on stream and log in with the password

507
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,920
angelkawaii2, log in.

508
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Oh, wait, like angelkawaii2.

509
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Sorry, I do things phonetically.

510
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
I see, you've logged in, this is it, we're,

511
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,040
this is where, oh no, everyone knows I can't read now.

512
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,240
Ah, it's got to fast.

513
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
We'll be together no matter what happens online,

514
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,040
whether I die or I get arrested or I break,

515
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,880
or I get stabbed or I get flamed,

516
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,680
or I become god or go crazy.

517
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,560
But Jenga, thank you for the tip as well.

518
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,400
That's got to happen,

519
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,720
the main reason I'm here for overall,

520
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,120
thank you for the tip.

521
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,560
We'll be together no matter what happens.

522
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,120
The internet is truly the festering cesspool of heck,

523
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,280
born from modern society.

524
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,560
But even so, I have nowhere else to turn to.

525
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,720
You're squidding me right now.

526
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,280
Doctor Resurgence, thank you for the tip.

527
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,240
Okay, you're awesome and I love your accent.

528
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,880
Thank you so much for the tip, I appreciate it.

529
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,400
Cause I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.

530
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,560
I don't want to get out.

531
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,480
I don't want to get a proper job.

532
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,200
No, she's a need, no.

533
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm scared of other people, adults pee me off

534
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,760
and I'm bum bum, I'm dum dum.

535
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,240
And I still want everyone to fawn over me.

536
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,320
She wants to be an idol and streamers get fawned over

537
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,720
and the most, over the most right now.

538
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,880
Oh God, everyone knows I can't read.

539
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,280
So that's why I want to be one.

540
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,120
Thanks for sizing up all my gear

541
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,800
and getting my streams off while you're running.

542
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,040
Peach and, my name's Pete.

543
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,480
Heck yeah, my name's Pete.

544
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,280
When I send you a DM,

545
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,160
you can sometimes fix your own reply.

546
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,680
When the time comes,

547
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,320
make sure you think long and hard what to say.

548
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,460
Peach and.

549
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,220
Peach on.

550
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
Yep, you're my Peach and cause you're so.

551
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Oh, wait, we're the manager.

552
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,480
We're the manager.

553
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,640
I mean, you're the only,

554
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,120
this is the people that have been emailing the website.

555
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,460
That's all I'm going to say when they're like,

556
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,600
I want to be a talent manager and have no Thanks.

557
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,000
I mean, you're the only person in the world

558
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,040
who understands and supports me

559
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
and you're my one true love and you're also

560
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,740
like my producer, so fit,

561
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,600
oh, this is the freaking scar.

562
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,480
Okay, you're super smart.

563
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,120
No, you're super smart for naming them unlike me.

564
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,660
So you can gave me, you can tell me or anything and I'll do it.

565
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,760
Let's do this, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this,

566
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,480
let's do this, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this.

567
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,160
Oh, it's almost time.

568
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,720
My makeup looks good, got my wig.

569
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,880
Perfect.

570
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,440
Here we go.

571
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,140
Here we go, it's time for my first and go.

572
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,160
Wait, this is late.

573
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Wait, this is good though.

574
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,160
That would not have been cheap to...

575
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,160
During each stream, you can delete the annoying comments and choose two coloured comments.

576
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Super chat.

577
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Keep your cursor in the comment section.

578
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
What?

579
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Keeping your cursor in the comment section will slow the game down a little to make things a bit easier.

580
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Kawaii ne.

581
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Ohai wo gozaimasu.

582
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Nice, cheery.

583
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Cute.

584
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
What?

585
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Stream as usual.

586
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
As usual.

587
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
God, you're so cute, cute.

588
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Kawaii ne.

589
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Alright, so we're playing Mod Simulator on Ironical.

590
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Wait, YouTube Mod Simulator.

591
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Choosing comments.

592
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Weird name.

593
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Kei Angel.

594
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Kanjo?

595
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Weird name.

596
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Parish!

597
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Array of light, illuminating the chaotic internet of today.

598
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Bringing happiness to the nerds, floating in this electronic sea.

599
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Can I type myself?

600
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,160
Wait, so she gets stressed if I miss stuff?

601
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Oh boy, here come the nerds in the comment.

602
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,160
We're all here just to vibe?

603
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,160
So don't be mean.

604
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
We're all just here to vibe.

605
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
There's no point in starting calling each other nerds.

606
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
We're all just trying to enjoy ourselves.

607
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
A promise of future peace.

608
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
I'm a little manic and moody, but that's alright.

609
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Don't go depression on us.

610
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Does that mean?

611
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
I don't know if it's mean or not.

612
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I wouldn't care.

613
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,160
I feel like I'm deleting all the comments.

614
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Go get therapy.

615
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
No, right.

616
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
No, don't be mean so hard.

617
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,160
The internet angel has descended.

618
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Thank you for gracing us.

619
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Cheers.

620
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Yeah, read it.

621
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Oh, I can tell her to read it.

622
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Okay, okay, okay.

623
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Let's go.

624
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Let's go.

625
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
We got a little Minecraft.

626
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Wait, wait, wait, get out of here.

627
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
No, don't read it.

628
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Delete it.

629
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, delete it.

630
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
You silly sausage.

631
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
No, don't delete it.

632
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Why?

633
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
What was that?

634
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
What was that?

635
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Or do I tailor to...

636
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
Okay, I don't...

637
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
For goodness sake.

638
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
I'm a rubbish mod, honestly.

639
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
So when are you going to show us...

640
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
See, I would leave that in because I've been like...

641
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
I've got bikini models.

642
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I'm the terrible mod.

643
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I feel like...

644
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
I don't mind.

645
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,160
If it's a way for you to get your stuff out, then sure.

646
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,160
And while I'm at it, I'm going to be the biggest streamer on YouTube.

647
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
That's a threat and a promise.

648
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Oh my God, threaten us more Kangol.

649
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Is it Kangol or K-Angel?

650
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I feel like Kangol sounds like Kigo.

651
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Right, group Kigo exercises replaying.

652
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
You've got my support.

653
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Go big or go home.

654
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,160
So I'm going to shoot for a million.

655
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Jesus, lady.

656
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
You've got my support.

657
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Yeah.

658
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
K-Angel.

659
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Kawaii Angel.

660
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Oh, Pepega.

661
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
She literally...

662
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,160
An interesting newbie has appeared.

663
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,160
No one even freaking types newbie like that.

664
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
That's ridiculous.

665
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Show us what you've got, baby.

666
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Anyway, there's still a lot I have to...

667
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Anyway, there's still a lot I have to learn.

668
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
But I'm still going to be here.

669
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I can't wait to meet you all.

670
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
I think that's what she sounds like.

671
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Nice to meet you.

672
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
To meet you nice.

673
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Time for a challenge.

674
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Thank you for greeting us.

675
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
I'm K-Angel.

676
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Go home.

677
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Get out of here.

678
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
Oops.

679
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
I don't think I was supposed to do it.

680
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
You get out of here.

681
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Oh, and if you're a backseat gamer, do me a favor and stay away please.

682
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Well, what's wrong with freaking getting your hand held?

683
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
They're games.

684
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Nice to meet you.

685
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Subscribbled.

686
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
The birth of a legend.

687
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
First stream complete.

688
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,160
At the end of the stream, I will respond to the comments you choose.

689
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
The fans love that, so...

690
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,160
Aren't I so kind and generous?

691
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
I guess.

692
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Tweeter.

693
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Hi, everyone.

694
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Wow, this is my first...

695
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
This is my first time meeting all of you.

696
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Oh my god.

697
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
You're an internet angel.

698
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
What did you guys think of my first meet?

699
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I hope you're right.

700
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Oh, I can't read that fast.

701
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Oh my god.

702
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Oh my god, I'm still shaking.

703
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Did you like my performance on stream though?

704
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
So when she...

705
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Her voice is deep here.

706
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Kate Angel finally descended upon the world after we spent so long mulling over it.

707
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
We've got a thousand more subscribers, huh?

708
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
But that's not enough.

709
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
I want more people to fawn over me.

710
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,160
We're only just getting started.

711
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,160
I like that bunches.

712
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Best design.

713
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:21,160
I need at least one million fans to satisfy my desperate need for approval.

714
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
That's crazy dialogue.

715
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
I wonder what dev team made this.

716
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
We got to get that.

717
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
We got to...

718
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,160
We got to get to that within our month.

719
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
That's the most motivation I've got.

720
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Oh, she's done it in a month!

721
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,160
So let's make this month count.

722
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Okay, we have 30 days.

723
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,160
We can make Kate Angel the biggest streamer in the world if we work together, right?

724
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Yeah.

725
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Yup.

726
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,160
I love you so much.

727
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Oh my god.

728
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
I really hope we can pull this off.

729
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
We're counting on you, pizza!

730
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
We're going to make it happen.

731
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
It's her dream.

732
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
We have to make it happen.

733
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,160
I might break if you push me too hard,

734
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,160
but when that happens, we can just destroy the internet.

735
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,160
And anyway, I'll be counting on you tomorrow too.

736
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Good night.

737
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Okay, so it's a 30-day sim.

738
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Okay, okay.

739
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
Day two.

740
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Good morning.

741
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
It's my first morning as an official streamer.

742
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
Wait, it's already noon.

743
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,160
I'm just not a morning person at all.

744
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
I was a bit too slow on that.

745
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Anyway, since we're aiming for 1 million subscribers,

746
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,160
we still need 9,000 more.

747
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,160
But first, let's start small and go for 10k first.

748
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
We'll get there in no time.

749
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,160
And as you know, I'm completely useless on my own.

750
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,160
So you need to tell me what to do every day.

751
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
I know you'll make the right...

752
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Is this terrible of me to say?

753
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,160
But as a manager point of view,

754
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,160
it's actually super easy to direct people like this.

755
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.

756
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
So I'll do everything you tell me.

757
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Really, I have complete faith in you, pizza.

758
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
I'll follow all your orders perfectly.

759
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,160
And I promise I'll become the best streamer.

760
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Literally, I feel so bad.

761
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,160
But this is the perfect employee.

762
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Because if not, I think I'll break and fall apart.

763
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
Or I could break you.

764
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
I don't want to be...

765
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Oh, fuck it, I'm fucking her.

766
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Or I could break you myself.

767
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Yeah, you could.

768
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Oh my...

769
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Wait, she reciprocates.

770
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Oh my god.

771
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

772
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm sorry, my penis typed that on the keyboard.

773
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
I'm sorry, I couldn't...

774
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Gum in the side.

775
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
I'm sorry.

776
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Please don't be creeped out by a manager like that.

777
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Right, how do I tell her?

778
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Are we done?

779
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
Hang out.

780
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Oh!

781
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
Okay, okay, hang out.

782
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
New idea incoming.

783
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Sleep.

784
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
New idea incoming.

785
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,160
New...

786
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
I...

787
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Medication!

788
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
Oh dear, that's not good.

789
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,160
Oh, she feels okay.

790
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
So I'm definitely...

791
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Mental darkness.

792
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Wow, okay.

793
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Oh wait, what does that say?

794
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Collect ideas.

795
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
Okay!

796
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
I comprehend.

797
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
To collect ideas,

798
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
I want you to search the internet

799
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
for the current Twitter trend

800
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
of a VTuber model.

801
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Social media.

802
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Social media.

803
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Puts her stress up.

804
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
Pre-streamer.

805
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Vanity search.

806
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,160
No, don't do that.

807
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Video streaming?

808
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
No.

809
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
What's ST?

810
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
I don't know.

811
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Dender.

812
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
No, you don't need dender, hen.

813
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Go follow the latest VTuber trend.

814
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I don't care what it is,

815
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
but go do it for me, darling.

816
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
Someone I met for the first time today

817
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
told me you look like you would be

818
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
really into underground male idols.

819
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Do I really?

820
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,160
The task manager will show you...

821
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Oh, I'm learning, I'm learning.

822
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Conspiracy theories are always so interesting to read about.

823
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
It's so funny seeing people argue about

824
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,160
whether they are real or absolute BS.

825
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
I never get tired of it.

826
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
Okay, okay.

827
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
You're actually...

828
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
so smart?

829
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
I don't...

830
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
idea gotten.

831
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
But you know, I feel like if you go deep enough,

832
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
you'll end up buying into it.

833
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Sooner or later, curiosity killed the cat kind of deal.

834
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Well, I'm fine though.

835
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
I never let that happen to me.

836
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,160
I'm the most rational and logical girl in the world,

837
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,160
and the only thing that drives me crazy is you.

838
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Okay, if it's reciprocated love,

839
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,160
then I don't feel bad about being weird.

840
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,160
But anyway, I figured that conspiracy theories

841
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
would make for great content,

842
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
so let's start this off with a banger.

843
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
Okay, okay.

844
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
We can only stream once for the idea we get

845
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
from commands marked with an exclamation mark.

846
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
If we stream with a low level idea,

847
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,160
we'll be able to find another idea on the next level up.

848
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Comprehend, yes.

849
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Go to dust.

850
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Is that my only choice?

851
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
I don't really want to cross her out.

852
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Okay, it's making me go to dust.

853
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,160
I think I messed up your mediflicks recommendation,

854
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,160
because I was using your account to watch stuff.

855
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
I'm sorry, that's fine.

856
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
Wait, you can't stream...

857
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Do you actually need to go to bed?

858
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,160
Is she tired already?

859
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Do you need to sweep, little one?

860
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Or do you need to go again?

861
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Does she...

862
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Do you want to do internet again?

863
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Pre-stream alert goes up, but her stress...

864
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,160
It will change time tonight.

865
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Okay, okay.

866
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
I wanted to buy myself a super comfy couch,

867
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,160
but if I did that, I think I would never leave it.

868
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
I think it would turn into a blob.

869
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Go to night, and then she can stream.

870
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
So she can stream at night.

871
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Can I want to dye my hair pink something?

872
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,160
I think even more people would love me if I did that.

873
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
Pink is definitely an idol hair.

874
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Colour for VTubers is very common.

875
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,160
I actually didn't want pink VTuber,

876
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
but I think purple would have a pink one.

877
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
In general, let's be honest.

878
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Right, chat and chill, all hail the internet.

879
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
I think that's it.

880
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
So this is her doing her 2.0, so we'll do that.

881
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
So, begin.

882
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Transform!

883
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Honestly?

884
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm digging this so far.

885
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,160
This is already blooming out of expectation.

886
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Out of the war.

887
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Okay, very, very, very.

888
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Stream speed as usual.

889
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,160
Hi cuties!

890
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
I'm the internet angel.

891
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,160
I kind of sound like...

892
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,160
What the heck, the rabbit from Sonic Heroes?

893
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Why does she always say bless or whatever?

894
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Clearly because she's...

895
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,160
You're blessed to have her in our life.

896
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,160
You're so quiet. You're super cute.

897
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Feeling a bit blue so I'll be lurking?

898
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Lurk away.

899
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
More than welcome.

900
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Hopefully feel a bit better soon.

901
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,160
I love the internet because all of the lovely people

902
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
are willing to listen to you alone

903
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
and other intentional...

904
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Parish!

905
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Why, angel?

906
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Thank you for your super chat.

907
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
I love you.

908
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,160
I keep reading that.

909
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
It's Kigo.

910
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise.

911
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
My biggest fear is sentiment.

912
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,160
I can imagine living a life not being needed by anyone.

913
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
No, this is too real.

914
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Oh no, we're about to put on Mr. Kitty.

915
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,160
As the hours pass on, you'll live to know.

916
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
She sure is bold for a new streamer.

917
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
Did I need to speed this up?

918
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
Uh-huh.

919
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
I love you guys for hearing me out.

920
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,160
I'll keep working my hearts for all of you.

921
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
She says she loves me.

922
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
She loves me?

923
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
She loves me?

924
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
She loves me?

925
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
I don't know about the rest of you,

926
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
but your face sure is cute.

927
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Okay.

928
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
Well, I love it.

929
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
This is the true mod experience.

930
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Honestly.

931
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Can I speed this up?

932
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,160
No, I can.

933
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
I guess.

934
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
No takebacks now.

935
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,160
Chin hands.

936
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Oh, this is chin hands?

937
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
This pose?

938
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,160
I got Mercy have chin hands toggle.

939
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,160
Because it's all over if you get bored of me.

940
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
And I don't want to die yet.

941
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Let's go.

942
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,160
I'm gonna need more so quickly if I'm done.

943
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,160
I didn't bring any more.

944
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Please don't die.

945
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Please don't die.

946
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Oh no.

947
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
I'm bored.

948
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Why would you super tip I'm bored?

949
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Let's have a look see.

950
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
Why Angel?

951
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,160
I kind of messed up the super chats, but.

952
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,160
I've always been an Angel since I was born.

953
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
Because I'm just too kawaii.

954
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,160
Please don't die.

955
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
People die.

956
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
And whether I live or die is all up to my bet.

957
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,160
Whoa, steady on.

958
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
Oh well.

959
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,160
What a stream.

960
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Thanks to everyone who came along to stream today.

961
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Sorry I haven't spent all of my plays.

962
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
I'm so new to this.

963
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Love you all.

964
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,160
I never caught on days when Kegel streams.

965
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
I'm so good.

966
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
I can't read it.

967
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
Right.

968
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Oh.

969
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
Dear P-chan.

970
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,160
This is Saito from Little Bet Creations.

971
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
As per our last phone call,

972
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,160
your rent is still outstanding and you will have to pay.

973
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,160
You have until the 10th to pay for-

974
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Oh my god, I'm going to get kicked out.

975
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Please forward your payment to the account details below

976
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,160
and contact me when you've done so with regards.

977
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,160
Please reply to this email with any concerns.

978
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
I'm sorry.

979
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
I'm sorry.

980
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
What is this?

981
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Does this mean we need to pay all our rent by day 10?

982
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,160
We're broke as heck.

983
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
We need to be able to monetize our content ASAP.

984
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,160
We need to get more than 10k followers first.

985
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
Easy peasy for us.

986
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Let's go.

987
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
Yes, yes, yes.

988
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,160
Oh my god, you're such a hard worker.

989
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
What the heck is that though?

990
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,160
That little bear thing.

991
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
Right.

992
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,160
I need you to-

993
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Your stress is really high.

994
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,160
How do I de-stress you?

995
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Hang out.

996
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,160
Play game.

997
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,160
Stress goes down by five-

998
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
No, that's number four.

999
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,160
That's four.

1000
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Affection goes up between us.

1001
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,160
I don't want her to have to-

1002
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,160
What's this?

1003
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
Spend time together.

1004
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,160
Her affection goes up and her stress goes down by six units though.

1005
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
I think we'll do that.

1006
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
No, she needs-

1007
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Wait.

1008
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
Wait, hold on.

1009
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
It says dot, dot, dot.

1010
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
Love is in the air.

1011
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,160
Stress goes down significantly but mental darkness-

1012
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
Mental darkness goes down.

1013
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
Affection goes up and stress goes down.

1014
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,160
This is a win-win.

1015
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
This is the most po-

1016
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,160
This is the best thing to make her feel better.

1017
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,160
Sorry, but...

1018
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,160
Is that that game where it's like 120 levels?

1019
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,160
I promised to never portray you guys, so please keep on showing me all your love.

1020
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,160
Oh!

1021
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
Noory.

1022
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,160
Noory Nelly.

1023
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
What taking?

1024
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,160
No, what?

1025
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,160
This shows how much pressure I'm feeling.

1026
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
I might start acting weird if I get too high, so watch out.

1027
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,160
I may even become more scared of the internet by the day.

1028
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
This displays how much I love you.

1029
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,160
I'd be sad if I don't love you enough, but if I love you too much,

1030
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,160
it might be hard to handle to try and strike a good balance.

1031
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,160
This lets you know how I'm doing mentally.

1032
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
How well I cope with reality will change.

1033
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,160
Depending on the numbers, it might have a bigger influence over my future,

1034
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,160
rather than in your future.

1035
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,160
Show me one hater who bothers to wear clothes that fit them properly.

1036
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
That's the most bizarre thing I've ever read.

1037
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,160
We're definitely gonna have to research tomorrow.

1038
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
We'll do conspiracies.

1039
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
Why are you here now?

1040
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
Transform!

1041
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,160
Time for her voice to go like this.

1042
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,160
Oh, way up there.

1043
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
Men here have each other similar?

1044
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
Is that how it goes?

1045
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
I know there's lots of end-ends, but...

1046
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Thank you, ladies.

1047
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,160
It's okay, you two.

1048
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
We're a fixer who controls them.

1049
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
The fixer who controls them?

1050
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,160
What does that even mean?

1051
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
First time here.

1052
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Oh, yeah.

1053
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,160
Is that streaming on TV?

1054
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Oh, wait. No, sorry.

1055
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,160
I'm reading parts in the voice.

1056
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
I'm not supposed to.

1057
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,160
Do you think I can conspiracy theories?

1058
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,160
I do.

1059
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,160
I do.

1060
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,160
Have I read about them?

1061
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,160
But why?

1062
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,160
Young nerds love these.

1063
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,160
That's American viewer-spotted.

1064
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,160
Annihilate this man.

1065
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,160
Is this supposed to go faster than this?

1066
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,160
Oh, I love conspiracy theories.

1067
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
I'm excited.

1068
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,160
Yes.

1069
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,160
Okay.

1070
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
Do you like conspiracy?

1071
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,160
So, my company...

1072
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
I can...

1073
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,160
Please go again.

1074
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Oh, that's going too fast.

1075
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1076
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,160
Today, I'll be talking about their culture in conspiracy theories.

1077
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,160
Like, the fricking...

1078
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,160
Is it the ET game that's currently...

1079
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,160
dug into a ditch

1080
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,160
and it's like 40,000 worth of games or something?

1081
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Some people say that...

1082
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,160
They develop organically.

1083
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Oh, this is going too fast.

1084
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,160
They wanted to do the Japanese masses

1085
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,160
into nerds to numb them.

1086
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,160
Sounds wacky.

1087
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,160
But what if it did happen?

1088
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,160
I'm not a nerd.

1089
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,160
I think we'll do a nicer super chat.

1090
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,160
I think we could do a super chat

1091
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,160
that makes her happier than that.

1092
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,160
But then people get mad if you don't read them out.

1093
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,160
Everyone watching now would be dancing

1094
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,160
to the tune of three minds on...

1095
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,160
Feels like you're going to eventually

1096
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,160
go off the deep end if you...

1097
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
What, talking about conspiracies?

1098
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
But it's okay, because even if you...

1099
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
We're all...

1100
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,160
This...

1101
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,160
I can't even moderate it.

1102
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
I'm not a nerd.

1103
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,160
I...

1104
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
That's what a nerd says.

1105
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,160
And she's gone.

1106
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,160
Just like that.

1107
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,160
Jeez, right.

1108
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,160
I'm not clicking that speed up option.

1109
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,160
My goodness.

1110
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,160
What was that?

1111
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,160
You upped the stream speed,

1112
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
but I've tried to lower it.

1113
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,160
Did I not?

1114
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,160
Wait, is this her alt?

1115
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,160
I will...

1116
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,160
Shatalki Mushroom Yoll on my Privilege

1117
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,160
and will...

1118
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,160
As long as one finds that they can

1119
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,160
stay blissfully unaware.

1120
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
And even if someone does find it,

1121
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,160
it's not like I'm committing a crime.

1122
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,160
Even though it does feel like real, just...

1123
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,160
Wait, so this is her alt.

1124
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,160
Oh, and this is her mane.

1125
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,160
Oh, that's a shame.

1126
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,160
She doesn't even enjoy streaming.

1127
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
Then you do it then.

1128
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,160
So, but you didn't have to stream

1129
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,160
if you didn't like it.

1130
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,160
I don't know why we're...

1131
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,160
Can you write some good stuff about...

1132
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,160
Thingy on ST for me?

1133
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,160
I think it'll be too obvious

1134
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,160
if I do it myself, so please.

1135
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,160
Please.

1136
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,160
Medication gives her an idea.

1137
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,160
Diazipam?

1138
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,160
One milligram Diazipam

1139
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,160
makes her floppy.

1140
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,160
Brof.

1141
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,160
Brof.

1142
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,160
It's five milligrams

1143
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,160
that'll make you floppy, hen.

1144
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,160
It's not one milligram.

1145
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
One milligram does nothing.

1146
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,160
That's a tiddly wink of Diazipam.

1147
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,160
It's someone who's got the anxiety

1148
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,160
made, so I assure you, it's five milligrams

1149
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,160
is when you're gonna feel it.

1150
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,160
Right, I am going to let her

1151
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,160
get a new idea by playing games.

1152
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,160
She used to play some games.

1153
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,160
She's a lightweight, literally.

1154
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,160
All you need is a beat a blocker

1155
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,160
and you're good to go.

1156
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,160
And if you're really not good to go,

1157
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,160
Diazipam.

1158
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,160
I hit my gacha a bunch of all right.

1159
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,160
We just paid money for that!

1160
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,160
Did you just spend money

1161
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,160
when we have to pay rent?

1162
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,160
Nothing beats a good games.

1163
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,160
Humans were born to play

1164
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,160
and I'm getting the hang of this streaming thing,

1165
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,160
so I want to do a let's play.

1166
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,160
Let's do this.

1167
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,160
Yeah, that's exactly what you're supposed to do.

1168
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,160
Why are these reactions so scuffed?

1169
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,160
You have a new idea for stream.

1170
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,160
Let's play throwback stream.

1171
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,160
Hey, that's what I did!

1172
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,160
Go to dusk, go to dusk.

1173
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,160
Right, you can play again.

1174
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,160
I want you.

1175
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,160
I need you.

1176
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,160
I need you.

1177
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,160
I love you.

1178
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,160
I love you.

1179
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,160
Atama no naka.

1180
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,160
I don't know what the tune is,

1181
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,160
but I've probably heard it

1182
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
if it's that popular Japanese.

1183
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,160
I'll let her play twice

1184
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,160
so she can get two game things.

1185
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,160
Need to grind, need to grind,

1186
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,160
need to grind, need to grind, grind.

1187
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160
So I put a stress by four

1188
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,160
and affection up,

1189
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,160
but I didn't do anything.

1190
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,160
I just remembered this game I played

1191
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,160
where you become a big shot

1192
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,160
who has a global influence

1193
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,160
or whatever I actually got

1194
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,160
so into it, I ended up skipping it.

1195
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,160
What game is that a reference to?

1196
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,160
I just remembered this game

1197
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,160
becomes some big shot

1198
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,160
who has global influence.

1199
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,160
What game?

1200
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,160
That must be a reference,

1201
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,160
but it's so generic.

1202
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,160
But anyway, I know it's recently

1203
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,160
a lot of people these days

1204
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,160
like to play games where you have to

1205
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,160
rule, power to rule the world

1206
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,160
and even reduce population and stuff.

1207
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,160
What are these references to?

1208
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,160
There must be references to.

1209
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,160
Is the game,

1210
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,160
is referencing itself?

1211
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,160
Oh, Papaga.

1212
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,160
That's very plausible.

1213
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,160
And some people also truly believe

1214
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,160
that's what's happening in our world

1215
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,160
and make up these wild boogie men

1216
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,160
to direct their rage at.

1217
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
Wait.

1218
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,160
Is this because I looked up

1219
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,160
that conspiracy stuff she's saying this?

1220
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,160
I don't blame them though.

1221
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,160
I think considering the times we live in

1222
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,160
it's not so strange that people want

1223
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,160
someone or something to be angry at.

1224
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,160
Not as, not as dissect

1225
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,160
in human nature.

1226
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,160
Hold on, this game is,

1227
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,160
I love it already.

1228
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,160
What the heck, we're like human nature.

1229
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,160
But we should all be working together.

1230
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,160
Please, this is my only wish

1231
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,160
as an internet angel.

1232
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,160
Wait, but I'm,

1233
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,160
I'm eating this up for breakfast.

1234
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,160
Like, I love the intricate

1235
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,160
like one human nature, like you need something to

1236
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
sounds good, doesn't it?

1237
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Well, I'm gonna say that

1238
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,160
and see how the

1239
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,160
Schumer's React, they are my li-

1240
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,160
Girl.

1241
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,160
Do not bite the hand that feeds.

1242
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,160
My goodness.

1243
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,160
Oh no, she was talking about theories.

1244
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
I didn't, only one cover.

1245
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
Wait, am I gonna turn her into a politician?

1246
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,160
Can I turn her into anti-Margaret Thatcher?

1247
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,160
Please, can I turn her into our

1248
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,160
Margaret Thatcher?

1249
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
Stop.

1250
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,160
Stop, anti-Margaret Thatcher.

1251
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,160
Let's go.

1252
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,160
E-girl, anti-Margaret Thatcher.

1253
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,160
We believe in the public

1254
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,160
owning the fricking things

1255
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,160
and the private sector does not

1256
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,160
own or have stakes.

1257
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,160
And that the people do not buy out mistakes,

1258
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,160
buy out companies that go bust

1259
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,160
because it's not the people's problems

1260
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,160
for the private companies.

1261
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,160
Oh my God, yes!

1262
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,160
Revolution, yes!

1263
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,160
Oh my God, this game's amazing.

1264
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,160
Hi guys, it's Chloe Angel,

1265
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,160
the Napoleon of the Streaming Wall.

1266
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,160
Who's Napoleon?

1267
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,160
Right, not you.

1268
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,160
That's a terrible super chat

1269
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,160
and you should be embarrassed,

1270
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,160
but we'll put it in

1271
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,160
because we can take it out.

1272
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,160
No way we can do this.

1273
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,160
In 30 years, our world could be

1274
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,160
ruled by one body.

1275
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
Also, oh, we're too late for that.

1276
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,160
Conglomerates are screaming

1277
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,160
to create...

1278
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,160
Wait, I can't turn it off.

1279
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,160
What's a conglomerate?

1280
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,160
I've done another rabbit hole.

1281
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,160
The division has already begun.

1282
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,160
Oh, I haven't long ago.

1283
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,160
Conglomerates are scheming.

1284
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,160
They're even trying to reduce

1285
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,160
the world population to one billion.

1286
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,160
That's scary.

1287
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,160
I want to live in an equal society.

1288
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,160
I'll put it in because it's super chat,

1289
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,160
but we'll see if we can replace it with something else.

1290
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,160
What would the world be like

1291
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,160
ruled by one government?

1292
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,160
I don't know how I feel about

1293
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,160
worshiping a fallen angel

1294
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,160
being an angel myself.

1295
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,160
Lucifer, hold that guy.

1296
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
You can be my...

1297
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,160
You can be my fallen angel.

1298
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,160
Sorry, this is a chat.

1299
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,160
Keep freaking doing it wrong.

1300
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,160
I'm already taking action.

1301
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,160
Your frowny face is so cute.

1302
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,160
Is there any mean comments?

1303
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,160
I don't think I've seen any mean comments.

1304
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,160
Literally, we're playing

1305
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,160
the binding number Isaac right now.

1306
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,160
We've got biblical references.

1307
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,160
I'm kind of curious about

1308
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,160
that kind of world.

1309
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,160
Okay, we'll put that in.

1310
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
Wow.

1311
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
I assume if I don't...

1312
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,160
Like, if I skip this,

1313
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,160
I'll miss out on, like,

1314
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,160
she might get stressed.

1315
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,160
I'll have a peek at the comments.

1316
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,160
That's scary.

1317
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
I want to live in an equal society.

1318
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,160
Yeah, but then just sitting around

1319
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,160
and complaining,

1320
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,160
I'm going to change everything.

1321
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,160
Wait, I'm spying.

1322
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,160
No way!

1323
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,160
We're freaking starting a revolution

1324
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
as an e-girl, please!

1325
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,160
Yes, you can...

1326
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,160
I shall be the new...

1327
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,160
I'll be the new god of this world!

1328
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,160
Yes!

1329
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,160
Oh, my God!

1330
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,160
Yes!

1331
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,160
How do I make her do more of this?

1332
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,160
This is amazing.

1333
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,160
Oh, my God.

1334
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,160
Oh, no, it makes her shaky, though.

1335
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,160
Oh, I don't want her to be upset.

1336
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,160
No matter what you're doing,

1337
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,160
you're always bound to end up fighting

1338
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,160
one way or another.

1339
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,160
Those who do not fight will not survive.

1340
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,160
Look at my DM and stop ignoring me.

1341
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,160
I'm sorry!

1342
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,160
Where's your webcam?

1343
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,160
Oh, sorry.

1344
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,160
Oh, I thought I can head-patter.

1345
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,160
Can I?

1346
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,160
Obviously, the first thing you've got to check

1347
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,160
is that you can touch next to this section,

1348
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,160
but hey, ho...

1349
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,160
Oh, I can head-patter!

1350
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,160
Take that!

1351
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,160
You like that?

1352
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,160
Head-patter.

1353
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,160
Okay.

1354
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,160
I don't think I can talk to you right now.

1355
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,160
I've just been focusing on your career,

1356
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,160
so it's fine.

1357
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
It's fine.

1358
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
Ah.

1359
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,160
Alex Jones feature for art!

1360
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,160
I want her to, like, take over the world!

1361
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,160
I'm going to make an Amazon wish list.

1362
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,160
What should I put in it?

1363
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,160
Bath bomb costume and expensive mic.

1364
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,160
I have to do that.

1365
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,160
Expensive mic.

1366
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,160
The people need to hear your words!

1367
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,160
All right, that's it.

1368
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,160
Yes!

1369
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,160
The people need to hear you!

1370
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,160
So not Kawaii, Nate.

1371
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Oh, my God.

1372
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,160
You're so Kawaii.

1373
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,160
Oh, she's blushing.

1374
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,160
You're so not cute.

1375
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,160
Okay.

1376
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,160
Okay.

1377
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,160
If this is you complaining about me not interacting with you,

1378
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,160
my lady,

1379
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,160
I have to say this is the most rubbish interaction

1380
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,160
I've ever seen before.

1381
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,160
We are sending each other emojis,

1382
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,160
and that's it.

1383
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,160
You're done.

1384
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,160
How do I make you do that thing again?

1385
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,160
How is...

1386
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,160
What was the one that made her get that row?

1387
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,160
I want her to do that right more.

1388
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,160
Her stress go-

1389
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,160
Oh, her stress is 61?

1390
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,160
Oh, that's so high.

1391
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,160
Her mental darkness goes up on social media.

1392
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,160
I don't want that.

1393
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,160
Daisling stops call.

1394
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,160
It makes you feel a streamer's voice is a lifeline,

1395
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,160
but it'll take too many,

1396
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,160
and stuff will happen.

1397
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,160
Okay.

1398
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,160
Everything just feels more manageable,

1399
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,160
and it makes you feel kind of floaty.

1400
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,160
Do we pop one?

1401
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,160
Fuck it.

1402
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,160
We'll pop it.

1403
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,160
What happens to her stress levels?

1404
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,160
Eh.

1405
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,160
Madame.

1406
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,160
Madame.

1407
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Madame,

1408
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,160
you did not have to post that on the main account.

1409
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,160
So her stress went-

1410
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,160
Wait, that was it?

1411
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,160
The stress went down by one?

1412
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,160
That was pathetic.

1413
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,160
Don't ever do that again.

1414
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,160
That was rubbish.

1415
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,160
Oh, my God.

1416
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,160
She's high as a kite.

1417
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,160
You are in no state.

1418
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,160
Is this a jump scare here as well?

1419
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,160
You're in no state to stream.

1420
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,160
Yeah, you're in no straight.

1421
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,160
That was useless.

1422
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,160
You're not looking at my DMs as quickly as you used to.

1423
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,160
You don't care about my girlfriend.

1424
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
We got rent to make, honey!

1425
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,160
Get them yiddies out!

1426
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
I love you, but get them yiddies out.

1427
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,160
What are you talking about?

1428
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,160
Right, how did I get her to do that?

1429
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,160
Come on, become a politician!

1430
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,160
Go on social media!

1431
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,160
Oh, wait.

1432
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,160
I think you just put her stress up more.

1433
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,160
Oh, I'm really bad at this game.

1434
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
Feels like everyone is a little on edge.

1435
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
Is it because of something they did?

1436
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,160
Also, please remember the streamer and people too.

1437
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,160
Oh, my God.

1438
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
I see that tweet all the time.

1439
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,160
Honestly, this game's pretty mad.

1440
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,160
I have to admit.

1441
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,160
I don't know.

1442
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,160
But then, wait, so how'd I progress?

1443
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,160
I want more of this one.

1444
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,160
Take a dive into conspiracy world.

1445
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,160
I'm not allowed to do it.

1446
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,160
Or am I allowed to do it?

1447
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,160
No.

1448
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,160
I think it regurgitates the stream.

1449
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
So you can't do that.

1450
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,160
The next idea for conspiracy is on internet video streaming.

1451
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,160
Okay.

1452
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160
Let's do a throwback to a game.

1453
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,160
I needed her stress.

1454
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,160
It's getting pretty bad.

1455
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,160
We're over 50%.

1456
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,160
We're at 56% stress levels.

1457
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,160
Oh, I didn't mean to skip that.

1458
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,160
But I did.

1459
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,160
You got a lot more stream ideas.

1460
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,160
Hey, cuties!

1461
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,160
I'm finding time for me to come.

1462
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,160
NICE never gets old.

1463
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,160
As usual.

1464
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,160
We're going to check out some truly ancient artifacts today.

1465
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,160
What, like Assassin's Creed Brotherhood?

1466
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,160
Goodness, gravy.

1467
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,160
I love games.

1468
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,160
I'm excited.

1469
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,160
What games are you playing?

1470
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,160
The chat would like to know.

1471
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,160
Hey, I'm just doing my algebra while listening to she's background music.

1472
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,160
It's such a good adaptation.

1473
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,160
See, this is so slow.

1474
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,160
But the next thing is so fast.

1475
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,160
Can I make her...

1476
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,160
Gamers, let's go.

1477
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,160
That's right.

1478
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,160
Gamers are in the most press.

1479
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,160
And play some flash games.

1480
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,160
Oh, I don't even remember any flash games, to be honest.

1481
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,160
Fancy pants.

1482
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,160
I think it's the only flash game I remember playing.

1483
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,160
It had like a mohawk.

1484
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,160
And it was just like a 2D.

1485
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,160
You look like you suck at games.

1486
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,160
And you look like you swallow at games.

1487
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,160
You're nasty.

1488
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
Thanks for the fives.

1489
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
Going to a rent.

1490
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,160
Don't know what's going on, but I like it.

1491
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,160
Yes.

1492
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,160
As long as you're enjoying yourself.

1493
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,160
What a lovely freaking chat she's got already.

1494
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,160
Although her design is like, oh, wow.

1495
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,160
Wow, this takes me back.

1496
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,160
This site should be the one.

1497
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,160
Wait, huh?

1498
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,160
Don't TOS yourself.

1499
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,160
Don't TOS.

1500
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,160
What are you opening?

1501
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,160
Are you all right?

1502
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,160
What's wrong?

1503
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,160
Oh, it's so old that support has ended and we can't play.

1504
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,160
Girl, you're supposed to pre-open the game before stream for this reason.

1505
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,160
Of course, literally.

1506
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,160
That's actually in one of my rule books for the girls.

1507
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,160
I gave them a document and it said,

1508
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,160
please open the game before stream to make sure you know it works

1509
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
and have backup games immediately.

1510
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,160
Yep, there is folks.

1511
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,160
No, that was rude, I think.

1512
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,160
You're so silly.

1513
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,160
That's cute.

1514
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,160
Lol, this is...

1515
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,160
This was more interesting, actually.

1516
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,160
Okay, okay.

1517
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,160
Literally in the document, I'm like, please open.

1518
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,160
I'm like, don't cry.

1519
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,160
Stop pandering to the old fucks on the internet.

1520
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,160
Are we ages out here?

1521
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,160
Hold on a minute.

1522
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,160
I'm not.

1523
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,160
You're not reading that.

1524
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,160
That's not nice.

1525
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,160
That's not nice.

1526
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,160
Or should I put it in there and then she'll address it?

1527
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
Possibly.

1528
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,160
I'll put it in so she addresses it and she's like,

1529
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,160
we're not ages out here.

1530
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,160
We're just here having a good time, you know what I'm saying?

1531
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,160
It's okay, there's always next time.

1532
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,160
You're lucky you're so pretty.

1533
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,160
You're lucky?

1534
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,160
No.

1535
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,160
Yeah, you spawned in, okay?

1536
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,160
You didn't pick the coordinates.

1537
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,160
You didn't pick what's going on.

1538
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,160
Alright, maybe I shouldn't have done that one.

1539
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,160
Oh, I don't know.

1540
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,160
Don't cry.

1541
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,160
There are only three situations

1542
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,160
where it is appropriate for a woman to cry.

1543
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,160
Alright.

1544
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,160
When you get dumped, when you lose your wallet,

1545
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,160
and when your childhood flash games get discontinued.

1546
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,160
Sorry, I've got warrable if you can hear me rubbing that.

1547
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,160
Stop entering to the old folks on the internet.

1548
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,160
Shut up, I love all of this.

1549
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,160
That's a cool way.

1550
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,160
Doesn't matter what age and gender.

1551
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,160
Okay, yeah, she's sure I'm done.

1552
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,160
That's what I'm talking about.

1553
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,160
So much for our first game stream.

1554
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,160
That's all for today, I guess.

1555
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,160
Blaze.

1556
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,160
Welcome to the house of Blaze.

1557
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,160
Okay.

1558
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,160
Well, that's it.

1559
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,160
What can you do?

1560
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,160
Things are only just getting started,

1561
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,160
so I have to try even harder from now.

1562
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,160
Come on, I said stop ignoring me.

1563
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,160
I'm 500 times more needed.

1564
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,160
Can I like like these so she knows I'm not ignoring her?

1565
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,160
I don't know.

1566
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,160
My fiction 50.

1567
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,160
Our stress is so high.

1568
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,160
We need to do something about that.

1569
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,160
We need to do something about our stress today.

1570
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,160
I'm getting nervous.

1571
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,160
I'm getting shaky.

1572
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,160
Right.

1573
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,160
For your stress, go and...

1574
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,160
Our stress goes way down.

1575
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,160
And the fiction goes way up.

1576
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,160
But the thing is, the stress goes down by like...

1577
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,160
What number of difference is that?

1578
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,160
Eight.

1579
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:03,160
Whereas the stress goes down by six on that one.

1580
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,160
I'm sorry, but a wee...

1581
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,160
Oh wait, I need to talk to her.

1582
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,160
Sorry.

1583
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,160
My new microphone's here.

1584
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,160
People have been calling about the sense.

1585
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,160
So this is really good.

1586
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,160
Maybe I should take it with me to karaoke.

1587
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,160
Oh my God, yeah, I wanna hear you sing, baby girl.

1588
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,160
It's lovely time.

1589
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,160
Oh my God, you're so cute.

1590
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,160
I'm dead.

1591
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,160
This is so cute.

1592
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,160
We'll be together in our next...

1593
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,160
Oh, are we doing afterlife?

1594
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,160
Yeah, yeah, together in our afterlife.

1595
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,160
You believe in that stuff?

1596
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,160
Okay, right.

1597
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,160
To bed you go.

1598
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,160
Go do your thing, baby girl.

1599
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,160
Let's get that stress level done.

1600
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,160
Cause I'm getting nervous.

1601
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,160
I'm getting shaky.

1602
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,160
Wow, some...

1603
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,160
What's something you guys are really into these days?

1604
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,160
Minus.

1605
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,160
I love everything about...

1606
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,160
I feel like my brain's gonna leak out of my head from how good it feels.

1607
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,160
I wanna have...

1608
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,160
Right, we're at night.

1609
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,160
Wait, we're at night already?

1610
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,160
Oh, for goodness sake.

1611
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,160
One day we'll be one of those couples that can afford to call a taxi to go wherever we want.

1612
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,160
That is so specific.

1613
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,160
Yeah, oh my God, I would love that.

1614
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,160
I'm afraid you need to stream.

1615
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,160
But her stress is so high.

1616
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,160
And I never even got her to get a new...

1617
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,160
I never got...

1618
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,160
Are you sure you want to proceed?

1619
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,160
You'll miss out on streaming at night, but I can't.

1620
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,160
I'm out of idea.

1621
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,160
Wait, she actually can't just do a zatsu off the top of her head.

1622
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,160
Wait, what am I supposed to do? Am I to send her to bed?

1623
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,160
What's going on?

1624
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,160
I already forgot what I told her to do.

1625
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,160
Is she doing something?

1626
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,160
Hold on, Danny.

1627
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,160
What are you...

1628
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,160
What are you doing?

1629
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,160
Are you doing something?

1630
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,160
Is she doing something?

1631
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,160
You can give her head pads.

1632
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,160
Okay.

1633
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,160
Oh, wow, I didn't know that.

1634
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,160
What on earth?

1635
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,160
I'm kind of tired.

1636
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,160
Thanks for always being so nice to me.

1637
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
Yeah.

1638
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:28,160
I should carry on your spirit and be nice to my little nerds every once in a while.

1639
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,160
Okay.

1640
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,160
How do I reduce your stress?

1641
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,160
Sexy stream.

1642
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,160
Her first ASMR stream.

1643
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,160
Let's go.

1644
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,160
Go two to one.

1645
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,160
So we can't do anything because we're, like, out of time.

1646
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,160
Can I, like, head pat her until, like, some of the stats go down?

1647
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,160
I think she was doing something sexy.

1648
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,160
Honestly, I was like, what's going on?

1649
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,160
Oh, we're on day seven.

1650
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,160
Rent's due soon.

1651
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,160
Hey, what color should I paint my nails?

1652
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,160
Light blue, purple, rainbow, black.

1653
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,160
I want to say purple because of her hair streaks and her alternative outfit.

1654
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,160
Light blue and red for her actual natural self, though.

1655
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,160
Light blue matches her natural self more.

1656
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:24,160
I know black is, like, the thing, but she is going to have to dress up for her stream.

1657
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,160
Aw, she's actually doing as I say.

1658
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,160
You're actually such a good girl.

1659
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,160
You're so clever.

1660
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,160
Good girl.

1661
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,160
I did my nails.

1662
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,160
Aren't they pretty?

1663
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1664
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,160
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1665
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,160
Like, it kind of matches.

1666
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,160
Jake, it's not even me that likes the color.

1667
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,160
Well, I knew black.

1668
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,160
Found a new girl.

1669
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,160
I like more than you.

1670
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,160
I mean, yeah, you get new Oshis all the time.

1671
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,160
You're allowed a new Oshie.

1672
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,160
You don't have to say it.

1673
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,160
I've allowed, though.

1674
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,160
You know, some...

1675
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,160
Right.

1676
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,160
Stress?

1677
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,160
Oh, forget the sleep.

1678
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,160
If she sleeps, sleep until tomorrow.

1679
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,160
A new idea if I sleep until tomorrow.

1680
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,160
Aw.

1681
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,160
Okay.

1682
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,160
I'm just going to send her a bed.

1683
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,160
We have an ASMR stream planned for tonight.

1684
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,160
She's going to sleep.

1685
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,160
Okay.

1686
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,160
She's going to sleep.

1687
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,160
Let her sleep.

1688
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,160
Right.

1689
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,160
ASMR time.

1690
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,160
Get the mic out.

1691
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,160
Get licking it, young lady.

1692
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,160
Okay.

1693
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,160
Did I make myself clear?

1694
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,160
I want to get ha...

1695
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,160
Oh.

1696
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,160
I don't think we...

1697
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,160
I don't think we're allowed to condone that.

1698
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,160
Sorry, but no, you're about to do an ASMR stream.

1699
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,160
And we need to make sure it's YouTube terms of service safe.

1700
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,160
Okay?

1701
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,160
So, no, you're not allowed.

1702
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,160
Go do ASMR.

1703
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,160
Right now.

1704
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,160
Hold on.

1705
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,160
I'm going to reach for a water ball from yesterday.

1706
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,160
Because I forgot to get a new water ball.

1707
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,160
Sub-squibble.

1708
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,160
Any sub-squibblers?

1709
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,160
First time.

1710
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,160
Hi, cuties.

1711
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,160
I hope all of you nerds are going through it today, too.

1712
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,160
Going through it?

1713
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,160
Like...

1714
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,160
The Mr. K is the always best.

1715
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,160
I want to die!

1716
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,160
Whoa!

1717
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,160
I don't think I can allow that.

1718
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,160
Sorry, I put my hand over my mouth in shock.

1719
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,160
Because I didn't want to...

1720
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,160
Like, to...

1721
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,160
I'm not a nerd.

1722
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,160
But...

1723
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,160
But...

1724
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,160
But...

1725
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,160
So much...

1726
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,160
Die show food.

1727
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,160
You're also good for always trying so hard.

1728
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,160
It's okay if you're chocolate-er.

1729
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,160
You can lie to someone.

1730
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,160
Honestly, I'm starting to agree with her.

1731
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,160
Hold on a minute.

1732
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,160
She's actually kind of starting to make sense.

1733
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,160
Like, sorry, but you actually have been told by the capitalist cogs

1734
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,160
that you need to be productive for every...

1735
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,160
Here comes the most jobless of them all.

1736
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,160
Eh!

1737
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,160
You have been told that you need to be productive

1738
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,160
for every second of your life.

1739
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,160
That's not true.

1740
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,160
You try harder than any of us.

1741
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,160
But personally, I hate being told

1742
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,160
that just being alive is enough.

1743
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,160
Eh!

1744
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,160
It's just such an empty-ass compliment.

1745
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,160
No!

1746
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,160
Sorry, I'm disagreeing.

1747
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,160
Hold on a minute.

1748
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,160
K Angel, you're starting to lose it.

1749
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,160
Get back on the politician bandwagon.

1750
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,160
I want you to take over Earth right now.

1751
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,160
I feel that.

1752
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,160
Tell him.

1753
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,160
I feel worse now.

1754
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,160
Uh, not for...

1755
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,160
I feel like that's cathartic.

1756
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,160
Is it cathartic?

1757
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:27,160
If someone, like, kind of just gets to vent and chat?

1758
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,160
I feel like that'll put her stress up, though.

1759
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,160
But it's, like, cathartic to, like, put it out there

1760
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,160
to be like, you know what?

1761
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,160
I'm feeling it!

1762
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,160
You know?

1763
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,160
I have a really good pick-me-up for you guys today.

1764
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,160
ASMR!

1765
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,160
Here we go.

1766
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,160
What is it?

1767
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,160
Yo!

1768
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,160
I'll be your team yell.

1769
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,160
I'll be your team yell.

1770
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,160
Smooch!

1771
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,160
Smooch!

1772
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,160
Is that what I'm supposed to say?

1773
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,160
I don't know if I'm supposed to go muah or smooch.

1774
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,160
You're my real life Angel.

1775
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,160
Love you.

1776
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,160
I've always wanted to try that.

1777
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,160
But now that I have, I'm so embarrassed I could die.

1778
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,160
May I stop keeping going?

1779
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,160
No, I'm not going to stop.

1780
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,160
I need to stop.

1781
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,160
I need to stop.

1782
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,160
Can you take it off?

1783
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,160
Yeah, we're gonna...

1784
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,160
I'll give it an A+.

1785
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,160
My first kiss.

1786
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,160
I'm so happy.

1787
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,160
Then die.

1788
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,160
Thank you for the tip.

1789
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,160
But no, I'm not gonna...

1790
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,160
This pandering feels forced.

1791
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,160
It's weird.

1792
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,160
Is that gonna stress her out?

1793
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,160
I think because we know she's role-playing, it will.

1794
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,160
Thank you for the tip.

1795
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,160
Okay, that's much nicer.

1796
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,160
I don't want her to get stressed out

1797
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:05,160
because I'm already struggling with her stress at the moment.

1798
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,160
She looks like Monka.

1799
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,160
Do it again, please.

1800
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,160
You're too cute.

1801
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,160
Yes.

1802
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,160
Ratchets in a way.

1803
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,160
I don't know if we're gonna make rent.

1804
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,160
I'm gonna make you my girlfriend.

1805
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,160
This is...

1806
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:25,160
I always send the girls these little symbols

1807
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,160
all the time in my messages.

1808
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,160
And they're just surrounding me.

1809
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,160
Love.

1810
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,160
Love.

1811
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,160
Love and thank you for the super chat, too.

1812
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,160
I love a man who can send me both love and money.

1813
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,160
Love and money.

1814
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,160
And thank you kiss for you.

1815
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,160
And I'll thank you kiss for you more.

1816
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,160
Thanks.

1817
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,160
Please go down.

1818
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,160
Why did you say that?

1819
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,160
Are you squidding me right now?

1820
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,160
Why did you say that?

1821
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,160
Beryl, I thank you kiss for you more.

1822
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,160
Why did she say that at the end of the stream?

1823
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,160
Why did you say go die at the end of a super chat?

1824
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,160
What?

1825
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,160
I was so confused why she randomly came over that.

1826
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,160
Did you see her?

1827
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,160
Hey, did you all like what you saw the date?

1828
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,160
If you did, let's play again tomorrow.

1829
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,160
Did some basic ass pandering in my stats or skyroll?

1830
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,160
Oh, wow.

1831
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,160
I actually did.

1832
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,160
Oh, her stress is so high after that.

1833
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,160
But the longest way around is the shortest way home, right?

1834
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,160
I can't just ignore the groves.

1835
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,160
One new Twitter.

1836
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,160
I missed it.

1837
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,160
You guys are having...

1838
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,160
You guys are having a really tough time in life.

1839
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,160
When you're in life, things are doing overwhelming.

1840
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,160
But shut up, everyone.

1841
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,160
As long as you're not falling forward,

1842
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,160
you'll find me waiting for you on the internet.

1843
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,160
Is that the end?

1844
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,160
Do you need a head part?

1845
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,160
Is there a secret to the stress level thing?

1846
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,160
I think I'm not achieving whatever it is.

1847
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,160
I don't want her to break.

1848
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,160
I reached 10.

1849
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,160
I want to do a celebration stream,

1850
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,160
but you know, 10k is a nice number,

1851
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,160
but that's about it.

1852
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,160
Yeah, go for it.

1853
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,160
It's very...

1854
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,160
I was actually speaking to the girls about this.

1855
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,160
The first step I'm taking is a legendary angel,

1856
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,160
but I'm going to get everyone to celebrate it.

1857
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,160
No takes back.

1858
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,160
You will love me for...

1859
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,160
I don't know about you, Andrea.

1860
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,160
You have a new idea.

1861
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,160
Internet Angel, the internet and me.

1862
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,160
Thanks for 10k.

1863
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,160
Okay.

1864
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,160
That happened naturally,

1865
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,160
so I can fully de-stress her today

1866
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,160
without needing to come up with ideas.

1867
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,160
Wait, she's going to get an idea

1868
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,160
if I do this to her?

1869
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,160
It drops her...

1870
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,160
Wait, what does this do?

1871
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,160
Wait, two gaming...

1872
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,160
Oh, but she gets a new idea if I do this.

1873
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:53,160
I don't know what the thing is, though.

1874
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,160
Rest and touching grass,

1875
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,160
like a real streamer stress management.

1876
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,160
Literally, we need to take her out

1877
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,160
and go meet Gami.

1878
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,160
So when she meets Gami,

1879
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,160
things just even out, you know?

1880
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,160
Thank God they didn't introduce you

1881
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,160
to demonetising.

1882
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,160
I'm not even monetised yet.

1883
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,160
They won't update my stats,

1884
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,160
so I can't even get my stats.

1885
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,160
She gets a new stream idea

1886
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,160
if I do this, though.

1887
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,160
And she doesn't, if we do play stress

1888
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,160
and things, internet.

1889
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:24,160
Her stress goes up exponentially.

1890
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,160
Mental darkness.

1891
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,160
Cine...

1892
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,160
Video streaming.

1893
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,160
Watch a movie.

1894
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,160
It takes her to dust.

1895
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,160
You know what?

1896
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,160
She's not actually sat and watched something.

1897
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,160
Oh, no, she's crying!

1898
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,160
Wait, you didn't want to watch that?

1899
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,160
I'm sorry.

1900
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,160
Were we supposed to do something?

1901
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,160
Oops.

1902
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,160
I think so, didn't I?

1903
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,160
I keep looking up there.

1904
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,160
I'm rattling the channel page

1905
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,160
for the prison door screen monetised story.

1906
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,160
They just won't update the stats.

1907
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,160
I don't know why.

1908
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,160
The streaming site I use updated.

1909
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,160
I've got, like, idle anime, truly.

1910
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:02,160
And the best ones are the kids' idle anime.

1911
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,160
It's not idle.

1912
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,160
I'm glad you love it.

1913
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,160
Well, I guess that's why the page on the TV

1914
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,160
is my best though.

1915
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,160
Right!

1916
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,160
For any TV shows,

1917
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,160
really good inspiration for my streams.

1918
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,160
If there's anything you guys would like me to do,

1919
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,160
let me know in the replies

1920
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,160
and maybe I could do something

1921
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,160
that we could always have somewhere.

1922
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:22,160
A girl's idle journey in a kid's anime.

1923
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,160
Okay, okay, okay.

1924
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,160
Shake a prompt.

1925
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:29,160
Uh, stress is still faking high.

1926
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,160
Mmm.

1927
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,160
I'll miss...

1928
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,160
Yeah, I'll miss stream if I do that.

1929
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,160
Is there an internet?

1930
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,160
It only puts it down by four,

1931
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,160
but it gives her another...

1932
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,160
This doesn't do anything?

1933
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,160
I don't know, it's dindered.

1934
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,160
I don't know why.

1935
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,160
That puts her stress down by four

1936
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,160
and gives her a new news stream idea.

1937
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,160
That takes her to the next date.

1938
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,160
No, I think we're just going to have

1939
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,160
to do spend time together

1940
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,160
and put affection up.

1941
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,160
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.

1942
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,160
Apparently with this credit card thing,

1943
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,160
we can...

1944
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,160
No!

1945
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
No!

1946
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,160
No!

1947
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,160
No!

1948
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,160
Credit cards are bad.

1949
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,160
They're not real credit...

1950
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,160
No!

1951
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,160
Don't...

1952
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,160
I'll punch you.

1953
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,160
I don't care,

1954
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,160
you can beat me up

1955
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,160
and spit in my mouth.

1956
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,160
Do whatever you want.

1957
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,160
You will not know peace.

1958
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,160
Oh my God,

1959
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,160
this is literally what I'm asking for.

1960
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,160
I love it.

1961
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,160
I love you so much.

1962
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,160
Oh my God,

1963
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,160
you just read my mind?

1964
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,160
Oh, it says read when she reads it.

1965
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,160
Oh, that's kind of scary, actually.

1966
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,160
Right, what?

1967
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,160
Wait, what is this?

1968
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,160
Affection goes up during game.

1969
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,160
Game or girl goes up.

1970
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,160
But experience goes up.

1971
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,160
Ah, maybe...

1972
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,160
Does make stress 67s better.

1973
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,160
Are we going for the end ending?

1974
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,160
I don't know what endings there are.

1975
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,160
I've not played the game before.

1976
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,160
Click anywhere to give a head pat.

1977
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,160
More.

1978
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,160
Spend the whole day lasering.

1979
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,160
Oh wait, did I just skip stream?

1980
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,160
Oh, no.

1981
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,160
Maybe?

1982
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,160
No, no.

1983
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,160
It's time to stream.

1984
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,160
Okay, my apologies.

1985
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,160
Let's celebrate your 10k milestone,

1986
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,160
because that's fantastic.

1987
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,160
As I was saying before,

1988
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,160
I got interrupted by my own thoughts.

1989
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,160
I actually said to the girls,

1990
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,160
like, unfortunately,

1991
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,160
like, you kind of have to celebrate numbers

1992
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,160
as they come through

1993
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,160
to like make the tripper news or whatever.

1994
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,160
And like, it's really annoying.

1995
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,160
I don't like playing that game,

1996
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,160
but you do have to play that angle

1997
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,160
as a Vtuber,

1998
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,160
and it's like a bit like...

1999
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,160
I don't like it at all.

2000
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,160
You gotta do what you gotta do.

2001
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,160
Hi, here we go.

2002
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,160
Hey cuties, it's me,

2003
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,160
Angel...

2004
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,160
Wait.

2005
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,160
You're not reading comments for the stream.

2006
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,160
Hey cuties, it's me,

2007
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,160
Angel, Cypher, CypherSpace.

2008
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,160
You're crossing over my fingers.

2009
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,160
This stream is one to celebrate.

2010
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,160
Celebrate?

2011
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,160
What do you ask?

2012
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,160
Well, did you not read the title?

2013
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,160
Don't know how to make things for that game.

2014
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,160
I can't do anything actually.

2015
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,160
Um...

2016
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,160
Take your top off.

2017
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,160
Wait, I can't.

2018
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,160
This is nothing for you, I'm sure.

2019
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,160
I guess just skip ahead,

2020
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,160
honestly, because...

2021
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,160
no.

2022
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,160
That's right.

2023
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,160
Hi, King Angel!

2024
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,160
Have received 10,000 subscribers!

2025
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,160
You're such a...

2026
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,160
You could get away with...

2027
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,160
You could get way more subscribers.

2028
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,160
Oh, I can...

2029
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,160
I'm only gonna get bigger and bigger.

2030
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,160
I'm just gonna shine brighter than ever.

2031
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,160
Just watch.

2032
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,160
Everyone, subscribe.

2033
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,160
We need to blow...

2034
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,160
up.

2035
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,160
Celebrate with something tasty.

2036
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,160
Well, let's talk about the internet today.

2037
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,160
I bet you guys are...

2038
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,160
I can't read the path.

2039
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,160
You know, I really hated adults.

2040
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,160
They're all so fake.

2041
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,160
Adults?

2042
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,160
Girl, aren't you 18 plus?

2043
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,160
I'm getting nervous.

2044
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,160
Are you 18?

2045
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,160
I'm getting swayed.

2046
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,160
What's going on here?

2047
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,160
There's always a lot of adults on the internet,

2048
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,160
but they're all...

2049
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,160
But they were all true to themselves.

2050
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,160
Why do I find you being a dropout cute?

2051
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,160
Pat-pat-pats.

2052
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,160
They weren't ashamed of being into anime or manga.

2053
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,160
They were so free, so natural.

2054
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,160
I thought to myself,

2055
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,160
I want to live like that.

2056
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,160
I want to live on the internet and be my drizzle.

2057
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,160
I guess I wasn't too interested,

2058
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,160
but I'm glad I could share with you guys less.

2059
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,160
She said,

2060
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,160
you talk too fast for me when I put you on this mode.

2061
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,160
Jeez, the stream's already over.

2062
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,160
I'm gonna do a dang thing.

2063
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,160
Hello, you are all pure cinnamon world...

2064
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,160
Nerds.

2065
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,160
Thanks for celebrating 10k with me.

2066
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,160
I'm going to keep working so hard

2067
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,160
that everyone in the world knows my name.

2068
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,160
Please use that in a year's work.

2069
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,160
Look, I draw some fan art.

2070
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,160
Oh, that's so cool.

2071
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,160
That's so cool.

2072
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,160
Getting fan art is honestly crazy.

2073
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,160
I have to admit.

2074
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,160
Can I save it or send it to her

2075
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,160
so she can see it just so she knows?

2076
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,160
Oh, the night time trim is actually really nice.

2077
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,160
It reminds me of that Russian song

2078
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:57,160
that goes la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

2079
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,160
Best of me.

2080
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,160
She's 17!

2081
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,160
Am I ignoring her DMs again?

2082
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,160
How do I ignore them by accident?

2083
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,160
I'm sorry, I love you.

2084
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,160
I'm sorry.

2085
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,160
Can you get an achievement

2086
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,160
for clicking her head 100 times in a row?

2087
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,160
Okay, that's as fast as I can click.

2088
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,160
If I didn't make her happy, I wouldn't have won.

2089
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,160
I can hear that in the chat.

2090
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,160
Shit! Wait, she's actually 17.

2091
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,160
I very strongly think that any content creator

2092
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,160
should be at least 18 years old.

2093
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,160
Sponsorships, trying out new drinks?

2094
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,160
I got DM...

2095
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,160
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2096
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,160
Oh my god, that's amazing.

2097
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,160
Oh my god, love you.

2098
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,160
Oh my god, you're so cool.

2099
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,160
She's gonna know I haven't...

2100
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,160
Are you sure?

2101
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,160
Yeah!

2102
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,160
Yeah, this, I'm so sure.

2103
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,160
Wait, what did she ask?

2104
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,160
I don't pay attention.

2105
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,160
I got DM'd about sponsorship.

2106
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,160
Sponsorships, we're entering the big leagues.

2107
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,160
Let's see what it says.

2108
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,160
We'd like for you to review

2109
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,160
of our new...

2110
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,160
Natto?

2111
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,160
Wait, Natto is that fermented soybeans?

2112
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,160
Flavoured cola?

2113
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,160
And they said they'll pay me a year's supply.

2114
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,160
No!

2115
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,160
You have to accept US dollars for payment.

2116
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:24,160
You do not ever, ever entertain a sponsorship

2117
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:27,160
that say, we'll pay you with our product.

2118
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,160
No!

2119
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,160
Hard-earned, cold cash.

2120
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:35,160
Do not entertain, respond, reply.

2121
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,160
Okay?

2122
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,160
This is true.

2123
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,160
Yeah, why not?

2124
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,160
A job's a job.

2125
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,160
No, we are not doing that stream.

2126
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,160
Absolute waste of time.

2127
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,160
I'm going to send you to do that internet thing

2128
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,160
because I want you to become a politician.

2129
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,160
But her stress goes up.

2130
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,160
Her mental darkness goes up.

2131
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,160
But her stress goes down?

2132
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,160
No, her affection goes down.

2133
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,160
We will do...

2134
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:12,160
Is ST going to give me the fricking politician angle?

2135
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,160
I want her to take over the world.

2136
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,160
This takes me to dusk?

2137
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,160
Congrats on getting monetised.

2138
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,160
Why are they happy about that?

2139
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,160
So they can be her paper already down.

2140
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,160
Wait, what's this?

2141
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,160
This bottom book.

2142
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,160
POST!

2143
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,160
Oh no, her stress goes up.

2144
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,160
No, we ain't doing that.

2145
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,160
Your stress goes up.

2146
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,160
You go watch some cinema.

2147
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,160
I've been streaming a lot of anime by myself.

2148
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,160
Let me know in the replies if you have recommendations.

2149
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,160
Lying around and watching anime.

2150
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,160
Late...

2151
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:52,160
Late night anime is probably my favourite thing ever.

2152
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,160
Maybe I'll talk about conspir-

2153
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,160
YES!

2154
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,160
YES!

2155
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,160
Absolutely.

2156
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,160
Do it.

2157
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,160
But you know I'm a little scared to-

2158
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,160
No, keep talking about it.

2159
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,160
You're going to rule the world.

2160
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,160
You will rule the world.

2161
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,160
You must.

2162
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,160
You must.

2163
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,160
I don't think I have to do it.

2164
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,160
No, you have to do it.

2165
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:14,160
But I don't think I have to duel too much on that.

2166
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:20,160
Plus, I guess believing in them is kind of like its own brand of happiness.

2167
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,160
Please!

2168
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:26,160
But I think I'll talk about microchip snakes.

2169
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,160
Those are one of my favourites.

2170
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,160
YES!

2171
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,160
YES!

2172
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,160
Your PCs can scan the layout of your house.

2173
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,160
YES!

2174
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,160
I remember watching a talk show once in the sky.

2175
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,160
He was talking about an urban legend and another guest.

2176
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,160
It's like you got microchipped into you and then the guy was like,

2177
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,160
I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you.

2178
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,160
It was the most dead pan face ever.

2179
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:46,160
That was what made me look into this whole microchip business.

2180
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:51,160
In the first place, I guess I want to talk about it because of how plausible it is.

2181
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,160
YES!

2182
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,160
YES!

2183
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,160
YES!

2184
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:55,160
YES!

2185
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,160
YES!

2186
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:00,160
I want her to be like I'm a conspiracy nut.

2187
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:05,160
I've been falling asleep with my eyes open so if you see me doing that, please close

2188
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,160
your eyes.

2189
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,160
Please close my eyes for me.

2190
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,160
What the heck?

2191
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,160
Yeah, I will.

2192
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,160
Oh my god.

2193
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:19,160
Right, I'm just going to de-stress her because we already know what she's going to do.

2194
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:26,160
I put her stress up to post on social media which is such a shame.

2195
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:31,160
Video streaming seems like such a safe thing to make her less stressed.

2196
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:35,160
I'll do that and then we'll stream conspiracy theory.

2197
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:38,160
Oh tiny spiny, thank you for the tip.

2198
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,160
It's work time for me against Ronnie but enjoy the game.

2199
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,160
You'll probably all find I'm done but I'll catch up later.

2200
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,160
Yes, thank you so much.

2201
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,160
Unfortunately, it is a shorter stream but yes, have fun at work and thank you so very

2202
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,160
much for the kind tip.

2203
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,160
I appreciate it.

2204
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:54,160
I love videos where the person just talks about what they like even better if you learn

2205
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,160
something new from it.

2206
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,160
YES!

2207
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,160
Agreed.

2208
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:02,160
I may be dumb dumb with mental issues and a horrific academic record.

2209
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,160
Wait, hold on a minute.

2210
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,160
Hold on a minute.

2211
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,160
This is a henabit too close to home.

2212
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:13,160
But I still want to share all the things I've turned up researching these things.

2213
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,160
Wait, wait a minute.

2214
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,160
Hold on a minute.

2215
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,160
She wants to do education streams.

2216
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,160
Oh, wait a minute.

2217
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,160
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2218
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,160
I'm getting mental Illinois.

2219
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:30,160
I'm going to do a stream talking about things I like and I like and my darling little nerds

2220
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,160
like and to do that, I guess I'll have to start at the very beginning with nerds themselves

2221
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:36,160
and I've already done plenty of research on them.

2222
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,160
Let's do it.

2223
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,160
Okay.

2224
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,160
Why are these?

2225
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,160
Oh my God.

2226
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,160
Yeah.

2227
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,160
You're so smart for coming up with these ideas baby girls.

2228
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,160
I can't even see you.

2229
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,160
Oh my God.

2230
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,160
You're so cute.

2231
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,160
Head pat.

2232
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,160
Head pat.

2233
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,160
Head pat.

2234
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,160
Right.

2235
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:52,160
Okay.

2236
01:26:52,160 --> 01:27:00,160
Let's go to the night and the moment I get a single wrinkle, I think I'll end things.

2237
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,160
She's hitting the wall.

2238
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,160
She's hitting the wall.

2239
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,160
Oh my God.

2240
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,160
I'm orb.

2241
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,160
Is she okay?

2242
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:12,160
I feel like these are just like such random emotions like as long as she's happy.

2243
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,160
Were you even paying attention?

2244
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,160
Yes.

2245
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,160
Oh my God.

2246
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,160
You're so needed.

2247
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,160
Right.

2248
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,160
Let's do it.

2249
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:23,160
Oh, stress goes up so much talking about these though.

2250
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:27,160
Her mental darkness goes up.

2251
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:30,160
But communication and rabbit hole go up so much though.

2252
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:34,160
Take a deep dive into the conspiracy of the world but don't go too deep.

2253
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:37,160
But I want her to do it.

2254
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,160
Right.

2255
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:42,160
She's definitely going to be on stress management but we're doing it.

2256
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,160
Wait.

2257
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,160
Yeah.

2258
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,160
Yeah.

2259
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,160
We're doing it.

2260
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,160
She's spain.

2261
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,160
She's an orb.

2262
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,160
She's orbudes.

2263
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,160
Wow.

2264
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,160
Look at them nails.

2265
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,160
Hey.

2266
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,160
You changed your nails already.

2267
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:59,160
They're supposed to be blue like your hair color and there's little things.

2268
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,160
Subscribble on ear.

2269
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:08,160
As technology improves by leaps and bounds perhaps one day we will all be bankrupt.

2270
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,160
Oh wait.

2271
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,160
Turn it down.

2272
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,160
Okay.

2273
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,160
K angel.

2274
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,160
Hey.

2275
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,160
Hello.

2276
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,160
Hello.

2277
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,160
Hey.

2278
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,160
Hello.

2279
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,160
Hi.

2280
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:24,160
Hi.

2281
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,160
Hi.

2282
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,160
And you come and you come.

2283
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:29,160
What would her fan base K angel fan base name be?

2284
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:35,160
If she's an angel and you follow an angel I guess so you're a worshipper really.

2285
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,160
Yeah.

2286
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,160
You just be fan name would be worshipper.

2287
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,160
K goals.

2288
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,160
Okay.

2289
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,160
Well I can't.

2290
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,160
Yeah.

2291
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,160
Yeah.

2292
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,160
She's a streamer.

2293
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,160
She's needy.

2294
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:50,160
And now we need to the overload of weekend rule credits.

2295
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,160
Their name is nerds.

2296
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,160
That's what she said.

2297
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,160
Oh okay.

2298
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,160
Okay.

2299
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,160
Call member.

2300
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,160
Let's go.

2301
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,160
See it's so slow.

2302
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:01,160
If you don't it's literally so slow.

2303
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:05,160
If I don't speed this up but it's like far too fast.

2304
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,160
I don't know maybe nothing's bugging out.

2305
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:11,160
I don't know the game seems pretty like the game seems pretty put well together.

2306
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,160
Do I need clicker?

2307
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,160
No.

2308
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,160
Nothing's happening.

2309
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:22,160
Imagine cities of people being controlled by microchips embedded from birth.

2310
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,160
Going into the deep end.

2311
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,160
Yeah.

2312
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:31,160
I'm barely doing work with work I can watch a game now.

2313
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:36,160
We're doing the politician route question mark or the conspiracy not route concert.

2314
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,160
I see you're also enlightened.

2315
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,160
Yeah.

2316
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,160
That's so scary.

2317
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,160
I got one in my arm.

2318
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,160
What?

2319
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,160
What?

2320
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:51,160
I've just noticed the music gets quieter when I tab over to do moderation stuff and then.

2321
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:55,160
That's a really good detail.

2322
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,160
I've got a microchip too.

2323
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,160
Is she going to?

2324
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:05,160
I feel like that's going to spur her on to do more microchip to do more of these types of streams.

2325
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:08,160
Another government conspiracy.

2326
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:11,160
Wait until you learn about that time.

2327
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:15,160
The ruling class could manipulate our brainwaves as we like.

2328
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,160
We'd all use our puppets.

2329
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,160
Oh my god.

2330
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,160
I don't want to be main controlled.

2331
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,160
No way.

2332
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,160
You mean I could be brainwashed right now?

2333
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,160
Oh wait.

2334
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,160
Where's my tinfoil hat?

2335
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,160
Exactly.

2336
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,160
We're going to be the tinfoil hat gang.

2337
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:44,160
Maybe just maybe we already have those chips in our arms.

2338
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:49,160
You could not be suggesting such a thing my innocent VTuber.

2339
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,160
Idol Angel.

2340
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,160
Kate Angel.

2341
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,160
Was that a scream?

2342
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,160
How did you find out about this?

2343
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:01,160
Take that instead of the microchip thing.

2344
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:15,160
We'll be living under a dictatorship soon mark my words.

2345
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,160
We are all on a watch list right now.

2346
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,160
Kate Angel branded tinfoil hat.

2347
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:24,160
Hat marriage win honestly.

2348
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:27,160
I'm not going to be able to sleep after this.

2349
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,160
The music is so good.

2350
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,160
I don't know who crafted it but.

2351
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:37,160
As if that technology could exist.

2352
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,160
Relax people.

2353
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,160
Thank god.

2354
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,160
Phew.

2355
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,160
Stronecottle's branded tinfoil.

2356
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:48,160
Literally just get tinfoil out of the cupboard.

2357
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,160
That was scary.

2358
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,160
For now anyway.

2359
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,160
Oh her eyes are starting to change.

2360
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,160
Am I noticing that?

2361
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,160
I'm actually going to leave that one.

2362
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,160
I'll leave the dystopia one.

2363
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,160
But yeah.

2364
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:12,160
Her eyes are changing or have I just made that up?

2365
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,160
Please talk about this forever Kate Angel.

2366
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,160
She's going.

2367
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,160
Oh my god I'm loving this route.

2368
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,160
Is the music going up because she's going this route?

2369
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,160
Because I don't remember.

2370
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:26,160
You're not like the other girls.

2371
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,160
Yeah she ain't.

2372
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,160
I'm going to make sure of it.

2373
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,160
I feel like I'm going to fall really hard for Kate Angel.

2374
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,160
That click mouse button sounds like the

2375
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:46,160
Legend of Zelda Minish Cap raindroplets

2376
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,160
or slime droplets.

2377
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,160
Let's have a look see.

2378
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,160
I don't want to be mind controlled.

2379
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,160
Scary isn't it?

2380
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:01,160
It'd be scary if I were real though.

2381
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,160
How did you find out about this?

2382
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,160
Um, why do you ask?

2383
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,160
Am I being interrogated?

2384
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,160
The government must have sent you to kill me.

2385
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,160
Wait.

2386
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,160
Girl.

2387
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,160
Bless.

2388
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:18,160
Amen.

2389
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,160
Amen in the chat.

2390
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,160
Why are you guys saying bless or whatever?

2391
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:24,160
Because we're a cult though.

2392
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:26,160
Bless.

2393
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,160
We're a cult.

2394
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,160
Bless.

2395
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:30,160
Literally get them hand emojis out there.

2396
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,160
Bless.

2397
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,160
Couldn't come up with a better greeting.

2398
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:33,160
Greeting.

2399
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,160
We're about to be out.

2400
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,160
The cult is forming.

2401
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,160
What have I done?

2402
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,160
I should have really like a scream being incorporated into the music.

2403
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,160
Ah, look at you.

2404
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,160
Bless.

2405
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,160
She did it.

2406
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,160
We do have to maintain.

2407
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,160
Help me.

2408
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:59,160
The microchip in my arm is controlling what I post.

2409
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:02,160
Microchips are like whatever because even without them,

2410
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,160
you still can't prove that we actually have free will.

2411
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,160
Oh, she's at breaking point.

2412
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,160
She's at breaking point.

2413
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:11,160
Definitely de-stressed day today.

2414
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,160
Hello, pumpkin spice.

2415
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:17,160
I believe this is the biggest de-stresser I can do to you right now.

2416
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:20,160
It does take me all the way.

2417
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,160
If we miss a day of streaming, it takes it to 65.

2418
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,160
Or if we do that, it's 71.

2419
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,160
Oh, it's still quite high.

2420
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:31,160
I don't want her on edge though.

2421
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,160
These didn't do anything.

2422
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,160
If she takes a third one, it gives her an idea,

2423
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,160
like a psychedelic route you can maybe do.

2424
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,160
No, right.

2425
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,160
We'll do...

2426
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,160
We'll just do this.

2427
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:50,160
I know it takes us tonight,

2428
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:53,160
but I really want her to do...

2429
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,160
Oh, I keep ignoring her messages.

2430
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:57,160
I'm sorry.

2431
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,160
I keep forgetting.

2432
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:03,160
I'm super like manager in this right now.

2433
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:06,160
I'm not like VTuber manager groomer.

2434
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,160
I'm like proper manager.

2435
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,160
Like I'm going to make you successful.

2436
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,160
I get some blue DMs from guys.

2437
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,160
Oh, my God.

2438
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:14,160
On Marshmallow.

2439
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:18,160
I don't think I haven't been seeing what I've been getting.

2440
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,160
But let me just...

2441
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:21,160
Let me just say that this is not okay.

2442
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,160
Wait, what?

2443
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,160
But that's the best part.

2444
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:29,160
Okay, we're doing ASMR.

2445
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:30,160
I never thought about doing it

2446
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:32,160
in my k-angel outfit profile.

2447
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,160
Oh, hi, wait.

2448
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,160
Oh, wait.

2449
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,160
My clothes are finding crumpled.

2450
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:38,160
Do you think that I'll be fine to go on camera?

2451
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,160
Oh, well, if I can't leave...

2452
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:41,160
Oh, wait.

2453
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,160
No, this is a regular...

2454
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,160
Oh, well, if I can't leave...

2455
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:46,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2456
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,160
I mean...

2457
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,160
I mean, true.

2458
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,160
But like...

2459
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,160
You do get suspended and stuff,

2460
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,160
but a little head pat because you don't...

2461
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,160
Who's a good swag?

2462
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,160
You're my good swag, aren't you?

2463
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,160
Oh, who's my good swag?

2464
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:03,160
Not click-bleat.

2465
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,160
Not click-bleat.

2466
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,160
Not click-bleat.

2467
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,160
Not to collect the eight.

2468
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,160
Jesus.

2469
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,160
Lying down and...

2470
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:15,160
Is it super comfy?

2471
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:18,160
I think I need to get a water and a cola.

2472
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:20,160
The words are mashing together.

2473
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,160
And now I can't get up.

2474
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,160
Come, please help me.

2475
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,160
Yes.

2476
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:26,160
I'm freaking...

2477
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,160
I think I have to get a cola and a water,

2478
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,160
unironically.

2479
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:32,160
The words start mashing together if I read for too long.

2480
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:35,160
Oh, our stress goes round and round.

2481
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:37,160
Is there any stream that doesn't put your stress up?

2482
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,160
Like, I don't feel stressed when I stream.

2483
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,160
Is that bad?

2484
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,160
Do we have to skip?

2485
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,160
Honestly, do we have to skip?

2486
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,160
I think we skip and do ASMR tomorrow.

2487
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,160
Um, no.

2488
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,160
Not the medication.

2489
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,160
I don't think that's a good route for you, darling,

2490
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,160
because if you start relying on it...

2491
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:05,160
67 to watch something.

2492
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:10,160
65 to play together or...

2493
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:14,160
59.

2494
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,160
59.

2495
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,160
Yeah, no stream.

2496
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,160
We'll do ASMR tomorrow.

2497
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,160
No stream.

2498
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,160
Let her take a day off, yes.

2499
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,160
Can't really.

2500
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,160
I stream every single day,

2501
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,160
so I'm not really sure what the issue is, hen.

2502
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,160
If I ever find my special someone,

2503
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,160
I want to go to the amusement park

2504
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:32,160
with them.

2505
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,160
We can scream together.

2506
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:34,160
Scream together?

2507
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:35,160
Eat ice cream together?

2508
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,160
Rape the Ferris wheel?

2509
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:37,160
Why would you scream?

2510
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,160
Oh, an amusement park!

2511
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:40,160
Sorry.

2512
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,160
I thought it meant a park park, like,

2513
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,160
that one in New York City or something.

2514
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,160
Why would you scream there?

2515
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,160
Uh, I made up with Peachhan.

2516
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,160
I made up with Peachhan,

2517
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:52,160
and then things got a bit...

2518
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,160
What?

2519
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,160
Wait, you made up?

2520
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,160
You fell out?

2521
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:01,160
Is she, like, super lovey-and-dovey?

2522
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:06,160
Monetization.

2523
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,160
Oh, she got monetization!

2524
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:08,160
Congrats!

2525
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,160
That's perfect.

2526
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,160
You're amazing.

2527
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:12,160
Ignoring you.

2528
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:13,160
No, you're not.

2529
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:15,160
You're literally freaking sending me emojis.

2530
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:20,160
We won't get convicted

2531
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,160
because those online nerds

2532
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:24,160
can pay for our rent, Jesus.

2533
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,160
Dodged a bullet there.

2534
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,160
I don't want to have us

2535
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,160
to stream out on the streets.

2536
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,160
I really need a cola.

2537
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,160
I need a freaking...

2538
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,160
I'm gonna go grab a cola in a war.

2539
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,160
I'll literally be a second.

2540
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,160
I'm like...

2541
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,160
Oh, my God, I can't.

2542
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,160
There's so many words to word.

2543
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,160
I don't know if you guys get this,

2544
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:42,160
but if you read for too long,

2545
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:44,160
all the letters start merging together,

2546
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,160
and it's really hard to think of.

2547
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:47,160
Like, a context,

2548
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,160
a view of one heritage.

2549
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,160
The actual word is...

2550
01:38:52,160 --> 01:39:01,160
It's not over all my feelings.

2551
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,160
I don't know how you do it,

2552
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,160
but maybe you're a bit different...

2553
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:08,160
And yes, I did just keep talking

2554
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,160
while I walked into the room.

2555
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,160
I probably didn't even hear anything.

2556
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,160
I got my cola in a war.

2557
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,160
I'm gonna take a little sipping tin.

2558
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:17,160
Put my blanket around me again.

2559
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,160
I'm actually wearing underwear today.

2560
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,160
I can't believe it.

2561
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,160
It's a Christmas miracle,

2562
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:27,160
But I'm not wearing a hoodie, I've just got my blanket like a poncho, like a poncho.

2563
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:34,160
These streams are always a blast to watch, yeah?

2564
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,160
Are you ready for the rabbit hole route ending?

2565
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:41,160
I actually kind of, I'm interested to see what the other endings are.

2566
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:48,160
I don't think I'm going to do the other endings, so please don't get excited for a strapped in big long stream or anything like that.

2567
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:54,160
I think I will happily watch what the other endings look like.

2568
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:57,160
Let's take a little water sipping tin.

2569
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:04,160
If you are remaining seated, please do wiggle, move your foot up and down.

2570
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:10,160
And if you feel your calf muscles flex, then that's good because that is helping the circulation in your legs.

2571
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:13,160
Just do a few of those and then you're good to go.

2572
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:17,160
See you later, bye bye, thanks for hanging, I appreciate it.

2573
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:20,160
Shibi cotton bum, 30 minutes.

2574
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:22,160
Shibi cotton bum, 30 minutes.

2575
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:25,160
I will redirect into her though, so don't worry about 30 minutes.

2576
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,160
That's right, you better wiggle.

2577
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:33,160
We're increasing that blood circulation for you.

2578
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:40,160
Oh, I just realized I can't hear any game sound at all right now.

2579
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,160
Is it because of that tab out?

2580
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:49,160
No, I guess it's the end of the day, so to symbolize it's the end of the day the music stops.

2581
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,160
I was like, where is it?

2582
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:55,160
You know, some things may be cliche, but they're cliche for a reason like this.

2583
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:58,160
Welcome home darling, would you like to have dinner first or a bath or me?

2584
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:03,160
Wait, is this cause affection is so high?

2585
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,160
I think so.

2586
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:15,160
The music is different as well and she's animated different.

2587
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:19,160
Okay, I like this kind of detail, like these subtle things.

2588
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,160
Oh wow, I'm like appreciating this game.

2589
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2590
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:36,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, did we just, we were supposed to do an ASMR?

2591
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:42,160
Oh no, she's gonna be crazy for me, she's gonna go frickin' yandere.

2592
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:47,160
Oh my god, I don't want her to go yandere, I need to like ignore her a little bit.

2593
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:51,160
I don't want her to go yandere, I want her to go politicization.

2594
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:59,160
No, no, you have to, you have to stream, you have to stream.

2595
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:09,160
Oh no, I'm, I'm, I'm frickin', I, I successfully gripped my feature for talent, but I didn't want to.

2596
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:14,160
Right, go stream ASMR please.

2597
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:18,160
Okay, it drops affection dramatically doing ASMR, that's good.

2598
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,160
We'll do that.

2599
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:25,160
Go be unaffectionate for your frickin' manager, cause that was highly inappropriate.

2600
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:28,160
She's like yandere on me, she's called Mercy Mode, honestly.

2601
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:33,160
You're too good, I'm too good in this sheet, she can't, suffering from success literally.

2602
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:37,160
Wow.

2603
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:44,160
Oh, her eyes are different, am I going crazy or am I just makin' up that the eyes are different?

2604
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:48,160
Hi cuties, is your favorite Indian, sorry I just drank a cola, so.

2605
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:51,160
Is your favorite Indian Angel, Angel?

2606
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:57,160
I love you.

2607
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:59,160
Oh wait, no, that's a chat, I love you.

2608
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,160
Okay, we can do super chats today, I can see it now.

2609
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:15,160
Get the hole.

2610
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,160
What should we talk about today?

2611
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:24,160
Oh I know, I've got a bit of a trivia about the corned beef I ate yesterday, what are you talking about?

2612
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,160
Is this relevant to the ASMR?

2613
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,160
Is this relevant to the ASMR stream?

2614
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:38,160
I don't, oh yeah, corned beef trivia, I've never been so interested in corned beef before.

2615
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:42,160
Wait, please talk every day about corned beef.

2616
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:46,160
Okay, her chat's actually really funny, I'm gonna give it to him.

2617
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:54,160
Corned beef ASMR literally, did you know that corned beef is shaped so because of old canning methods, which would?

2618
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,160
Is her heart pounding?

2619
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,160
No.

2620
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:08,160
Is her heart pounding because she's so in love at the moment?

2621
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,160
Good stream, but that's all it was, just good.

2622
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:18,160
That's a backhanded comment, so we will remove it because that's not very pleasant.

2623
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:27,160
Does this game have scenes that I need to be nervous about?

2624
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:33,160
Does this game have scenes that I need to be nervous about?

2625
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:38,160
A subbing for sure, omega lol.

2626
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:43,160
I did not know that was gonna happen, hey don't look, you can't.

2627
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:47,160
I didn't know, okay the game's safe, it's safe, okay it's safe.

2628
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,160
I didn't know if it was gonna go any further.

2629
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,160
You've just got yourself a new fan.

2630
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:58,160
Oh my god, I suppose I could give you a smaller one.

2631
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:03,160
Oh my god, that's so mean when the bikini freaking toggle came on and I'm just meanin' about typing.

2632
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,160
I didn't even notice.

2633
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:08,160
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2634
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:13,160
Okay this game, this game, I know it's early days because we haven't finished our route

2635
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:16,160
but I wanna say this is 10 out of 10 already for me.

2636
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:19,160
This game, highly enjoying it, highly.

2637
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:26,160
Literally flush emoji, flush emoji momento.

2638
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,160
This is so good.

2639
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:35,160
You're gonna get big I can feel it, yes okay, I thought I read that.

2640
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:40,160
Thank you mother for having me, thank you for spawning me in on the same timeline as you stream.

2641
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:43,160
You just made me smile for the rest of my life.

2642
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:50,160
I suppose as a nicer compliment then I give you a reward.

2643
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:55,160
But if she needs to pay rent and get more equipment, cause we got that microphone.

2644
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:58,160
I will never forget the stream for as long as I live.

2645
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:02,160
Don't worry it's already been archived eight times over, you don't got to worry.

2646
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,160
Can you do a workout stream?

2647
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,160
Oh, is there like a fitness route?

2648
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:10,160
That would actually be kind of cool, you can like make her boss.

2649
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,160
I feel like you're trying too hard.

2650
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,160
You're out.

2651
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:18,160
You will not hurt my streamer's feelings.

2652
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:22,160
Guess this makes you an arch angel for now.

2653
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,160
Wait, wait, wait, let me read that again.

2654
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:29,160
Guess that makes you an arch angel now.

2655
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,160
Oh, that didn't work.

2656
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,160
Oh no, did that work?

2657
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:40,160
No, my freaking thing doesn't work.

2658
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,160
My freaking brooms doesn't work.

2659
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,160
I'm so sad.

2660
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:52,160
No, stop, stop giving me money for something so small.

2661
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:58,160
You feel, wait, take my memory wipe beam.

2662
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:05,160
Oh, my freaking sand board's dead.

2663
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,160
I don't know why it's dead.

2664
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,160
Come on guys.

2665
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,160
Oh, someone's message me.

2666
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:18,160
Oh, Amy is such a fucking hard worker, you know that.

2667
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:19,160
Hold on, hold on, game, game.

2668
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:23,160
Did I accidentally go a little overboard?

2669
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:26,160
Yeah, you're just popped it.

2670
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:31,160
Hmm, I got way better numbers showing a bit.

2671
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:32,160
Hmm, I wonder how that worked.

2672
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,160
Hmm, I truly am a mystery.

2673
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,160
Can I talk to her?

2674
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,160
Oh, wait, we got our goal.

2675
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,160
She wanted 100k.

2676
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:40,160
She did it.

2677
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,160
Wait, we've won already?

2678
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,160
That's not right.

2679
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,160
Did she not want 100k?

2680
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:51,160
This isn't the first time reaching so many.

2681
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:52,160
I don't know what's going to happen for you.

2682
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,160
I'm a bit nervous.

2683
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:56,160
She wanted a milk.

2684
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:57,160
Oh, Hen, that's greedy.

2685
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:04,160
Hen, Hen, you're supposed to take down the capitalist cog of greediness.

2686
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:05,160
Okay.

2687
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:08,160
I need to thank them for their devotion.

2688
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:12,160
Yeah, I think she's going to get, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely do a thank you stream

2689
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,160
because that's like insane.

2690
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:19,160
What we will do is nothing affection wise.

2691
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:23,160
Definitely stress though.

2692
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:27,160
Yeah, we'll just make her watch two videos in a row, I think.

2693
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,160
Who goes there?

2694
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,160
Identify yourself.

2695
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:38,160
As long as the fiction doesn't go up, then I'm happy.

2696
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:42,160
I was watching this idol video and they were all eating popsicles for some reason.

2697
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,160
I already know where.

2698
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:49,160
Oh, ASMR.

2699
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:53,160
Oh, she's wanting the ASMR route, but I'm wanting the different route.

2700
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,160
I don't know how to get the fricking politician.

2701
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:57,160
I want the politician route.

2702
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:58,160
Is she okay?

2703
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:00,160
You look so annoyed there.

2704
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:03,160
Here, Jester asked me what I do and I was like, lol, I'm just a voice.

2705
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:05,160
That's what I was saying.

2706
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:10,160
If someone ever makes small talk with me, I'm just like, I'm just a voice actor.

2707
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:19,160
It's so much easier to explain than be like, I'm an anime woman on Das Interwebs, yeah?

2708
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:24,160
I'm just like, oh yeah, the Scottish voice is in demand all the time.

2709
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:29,160
You know, I get to play big strong women in my audios.

2710
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:32,160
Meanwhile, my audios are like, yeah, take it!

2711
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:41,160
Oh, can't she go outside for stress relief possibly?

2712
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:43,160
I'm dead, that's so cute.

2713
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:46,160
That's so cute, I'm dead.

2714
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,160
So not cute.

2715
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:51,160
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

2716
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,160
Love forever.

2717
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:55,160
Did I just do that and then she's happy?

2718
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:59,160
Is she like talking to herself when she does that?

2719
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:02,160
Or is that a reflection on...

2720
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:10,160
If I sleep until night, her mental dark...

2721
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,160
Okay, so sleep gets rid of mental darkness.

2722
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:14,160
I think we will do that, that's lovely.

2723
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,160
Yes, just have a wee nap, hen.

2724
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:18,160
You've deserved it, we rest.

2725
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,160
Okay, mental darkness.

2726
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:23,160
I hate this.

2727
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:25,160
Shaky.

2728
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,160
I wouldn't say...

2729
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:29,160
Are you okay?

2730
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

2731
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:33,160
I woke up on record time this morning, please...

2732
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:36,160
This morning is night time.

2733
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,160
Selfie time.

2734
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:40,160
You're such a girl, honestly.

2735
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,160
Selfie time, I mean...

2736
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:44,160
Wait, so why is that highlighted?

2737
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,160
Give me this!

2738
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:46,160
How do I unlock this?

2739
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:50,160
Does it tell you how to progress or is it just it happens?

2740
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:53,160
I want rabbit holes so badly.

2741
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:55,160
But don't go too deep.

2742
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:59,160
No.

2743
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:01,160
Right, we'll do...

2744
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:04,160
Thank you for 100k, because that is very...

2745
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:07,160
Special milestone to celebrate and it's fantastic.

2746
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:10,160
Just got to look around the ideals.

2747
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:14,160
You have to find it, oh...

2748
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:16,160
Okay, I think...

2749
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:18,160
Conspiracies would be...

2750
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:20,160
Not in a video.

2751
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:24,160
Okay, we can do this...

2752
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,160
I need to play that Russian song...

2753
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:28,160
La la la la la la la la...

2754
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:30,160
I can never remember it.

2755
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,160
Having my...

2756
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:39,160
Coca-Cola, he's too mad.

2757
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:47,160
Don't politicians usually have high stress and high mental darkness?

2758
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,160
I'm very greedy.

2759
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:52,160
I thought she said she wanted to become like some sort of...

2760
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,160
What's Socrates?

2761
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:00,160
Like a philosopher to rebuild a new world.

2762
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:02,160
I thought that's the kind of route that that angle took.

2763
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:03,160
That's what I'm trying to get.

2764
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:06,160
Well, that's what I think anyway, I don't actually know.

2765
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:10,160
Because I was kind of like, oh, let's be anti-Margaret Fatcher.

2766
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:12,160
And like, public...

2767
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:19,160
The resources of the nation need to be in the hands of the public and all that kind of thing.

2768
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:21,160
Yeah, yeah, I want to make her a god!

2769
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,160
Yes!

2770
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:26,160
Andrei, you've grown so much as an angel.

2771
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:27,160
Wow, that's...

2772
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,160
Your channel grows so fast.

2773
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:31,160
Our super, super popular.

2774
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:36,160
I'm an angel that came down from Earth from heaven to save everyone on the internet.

2775
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:38,160
Default setting too strong.

2776
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:41,160
I feel like you've said something similar before.

2777
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:43,160
Oh, I can't believe it.

2778
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:46,160
I can't believe Streamer repeated one sentence.

2779
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:49,160
We're not reading comments for the stream.

2780
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:52,160
Thank you for coming to bless us.

2781
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:56,160
I like how she's...

2782
01:52:56,160 --> 01:53:00,160
That's so gross down here, you should go back to heaven.

2783
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,160
Oh...

2784
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:11,160
The internet is oversaturated with users and content, but it's hard to tell what to believe in.

2785
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,160
Yes, you should do more conspiracies.

2786
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:19,160
Whenever you feel lost, I want you to know that you can believe in me.

2787
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:21,160
All right.

2788
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:27,160
Save us, my angel.

2789
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:33,160
And all believers will be...

2790
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:35,160
Whoa, we're doing the rapture.

2791
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,160
All believers will be saved.

2792
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:38,160
You just need to have a little fight.

2793
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:42,160
As the internet angel, I will always be by your side.

2794
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:51,160
It says exactly like that one Russian song.

2795
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,160
Beginning of a cult, cult, cult, cult, cult.

2796
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:56,160
Give me a cult, give me a cult.

2797
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:58,160
I want cult ending.

2798
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:01,160
I'm so glad we got tinfoil, foil, hat, merch.

2799
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:04,160
I wear it all the time when I watch your streams, Kate Angel.

2800
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:18,160
That's actually really nice.

2801
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:20,160
I think that's a good sentiment.

2802
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:25,160
Your smile is bright enough to illuminate the hearts of all 100K of us.

2803
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,160
Change 100K.

2804
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:29,160
Does she not say she eats these?

2805
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:32,160
Am I going to fail if I don't get her the numbers sometime?

2806
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:37,160
I'd like, do you always get the numbers and it's like a unique ending to whoever?

2807
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:40,160
Strongly blessing us with ink in this universe.

2808
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:42,160
This game gives Valhalla.

2809
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:44,160
I've never played that game.

2810
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:47,160
Oh, is this simple?

2811
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:50,160
Obviously, thank you.

2812
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:02,160
I skipped school a lot so I didn't have any friends.

2813
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,160
I don't like when she gets a bit real.

2814
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:07,160
Only the people online cared about what I had to fuck it up with.

2815
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:10,160
I used to sit on Xbox and skip school because I had a rough time.

2816
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:13,160
Hold on a minute, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.

2817
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:16,160
I feel like a lot of v-tubers probably had a rough time socializing

2818
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:21,160
and that's how they've got the internet culture to be a v-tuber in the first place.

2819
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:23,160
Or is she idle?

2820
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:26,160
She's not v-tubers, she's just idle.

2821
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:30,160
I didn't know angels had to go to school too.

2822
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:33,160
Valhalla is a great experience.

2823
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:34,160
How many ever?

2824
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:37,160
Big game, weak game, endurance game?

2825
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:39,160
She's v-tuber coded.

2826
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:42,160
I was bullied a lot, it's good for being so cute and pretty too.

2827
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:44,160
Jealousy is it?

2828
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,160
Try and stay humble, try and stay humble.

2829
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:48,160
Hold on a minute, hold on a minute.

2830
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:50,160
Can't relate to that part of it anyway.

2831
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:05,160
Did I ever tell you at my job, I actually didn't know it was polite to say good morning to people.

2832
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,160
That's how socially inept I was.

2833
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:12,160
I had to learn to say good morning, which is why I like saying good morning, good evening, good afternoon to you guys

2834
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:17,160
because I think that hopefully you do get to learn things with me over time.

2835
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:21,160
As long as you have faith in me, I will find you within the darkness.

2836
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:26,160
I literally didn't know I was like, you say good morning to your cool workers like a dumbass

2837
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:31,160
and I didn't know that that was socializing and really common.

2838
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:35,160
Guess that makes you an archangel now.

2839
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:37,160
Oh, that's strange.

2840
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:40,160
Or is it just to signify,

2841
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,160
Remember, you're never alone.

2842
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,160
Bless.

2843
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:47,160
We are joining the call, the bless call, bless call, bless call.

2844
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:53,160
Kate Angel having 20 concurrent 100k followers to create a part of the game.

2845
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:55,160
Oh, unbelievable.

2846
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:01,160
I can't promise to save everyone because that would be a lie, but if there's just one person to be saved, where's my person?

2847
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:03,160
Can I just say something?

2848
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,160
Oh, she got found her.

2849
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:06,160
Oh, she's greeting.

2850
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:08,160
No, didn't cry.

2851
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:11,160
We didn't need to cry.

2852
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:13,160
Why didn't you draw a cry in?

2853
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:21,160
Only thing really to draw me crying is because I'm just so happy with that we did previously.

2854
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:29,160
If my smile can grant soul salvation, then I will keep smiling for all the viewers on there.

2855
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:34,160
Are we changing her personality as well to become a god?

2856
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:46,160
I can't play a game, do Q&A, rate a gigantic turtle around Shinjuku.

2857
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:50,160
No, I want her to do the conspiracy theory.

2858
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:58,160
None of these are conspiracy theory for later.

2859
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:00,160
Yeah, okay, okay.

2860
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:03,160
I hate this.

2861
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:05,160
Wait, did her stress go up there?

2862
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:13,160
Her affection's still too high for us.

2863
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:15,160
She's like doing this weird thing.

2864
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:19,160
How do I find...

2865
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,160
Do I find the idea here?

2866
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:27,160
I put her stress up her affection down and mental.

2867
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:31,160
But maybe it'll give us the fricking...

2868
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:35,160
I want the fricking politician.

2869
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,160
Oh.

2870
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:40,160
What?

2871
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:46,160
I just found out an author that I've liked ever since I was a kid watches the stream.

2872
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:47,160
It's like a dream come true.

2873
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:49,160
Someone looks like they'd make me so glad to start streaming.

2874
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:51,160
I'm happy that one of my favourites would miss me.

2875
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,160
But when I replied, he was like, do you want a video called The Disappointment?

2876
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:55,160
I fell out of that for the video.

2877
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:57,160
I thought this was a real start for the mental.

2878
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,160
Who says that anymore?

2879
01:58:58,160 --> 01:58:59,160
Conspiracy?

2880
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:01,160
Conspiracy, please?

2881
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:03,160
Oh my god, what did you think?

2882
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:08,160
Do you ever get curious about what cringy things people have done online in the past?

2883
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:11,160
I reckon I could turn my past cringy into content or something.

2884
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:13,160
That's like watching your debut stream.

2885
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:16,160
Definitely VTubers watching their debut stream for the first time.

2886
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:19,160
Over again after a while has passed.

2887
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:21,160
I do agree that that's good content.

2888
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:23,160
I wouldn't mind showing our mock streams.

2889
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:26,160
I wouldn't show the girls' mock streams but my mock stream.

2890
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:32,160
I actually did better in my second mock stream attempt than I did in my debut.

2891
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:33,160
And that's fact.

2892
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:35,160
I'm happy to show it at a later time.

2893
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:39,160
It's a good idea, but to be honest, I just don't really want to do it.

2894
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,160
Oh, I just need to think.

2895
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:43,160
And it makes people want to die, but the suffering is what makes it interesting.

2896
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:44,160
So I guess I got...

2897
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:47,160
Being a streamer is so hard, girl.

2898
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:51,160
Being a streamer.

2899
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:53,160
I'm not putting you in any way.

2900
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:58,160
But then again, maybe the stars have aligned for someone like me.

2901
01:59:58,160 --> 01:59:59,160
I know it's not.

2902
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,160
Can we not stream today?

2903
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,160
Day off, day off, day off.

2904
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:03,160
I need to blow some steam off.

2905
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:09,160
Right, if you're genuinely not wanting a day off, that's fine with me.

2906
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:12,160
I'm going to drug you up and see if that...

2907
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:18,160
Oh, she's going to get so messed up.

2908
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,160
She's going to get so messed up.

2909
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:25,160
And it puts her mental darkness up to 32.

2910
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:28,160
Are you sure?

2911
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,160
Yeah.

2912
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:30,160
You wanted a break.

2913
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:32,160
Pass out on these drugs.

2914
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:33,160
Have a good time, hen.

2915
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:34,160
Enjoy yourself.

2916
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:36,160
Three milligrams of the Azepam.

2917
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:38,160
We'll not do this here.

2918
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:43,160
Oh, no.

2919
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:45,160
Oh, no.

2920
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:47,160
I thought you were going to go to sleep.

2921
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:00,160
More than the sweet release of death,

2922
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,160
I crave the sweet, sweet follow account,

2923
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:06,160
but still, why is living so hard?

2924
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:10,160
I guess I'll pop a few pills before going live.

2925
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:18,160
Breakdown stream.

2926
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:19,160
No.

2927
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:20,160
Uh-uh.

2928
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:21,160
Get off lying.

2929
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:22,160
Get a break.

2930
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:23,160
No.

2931
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:24,160
You're getting closed.

2932
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:25,160
You asked for a day off.

2933
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:29,160
I gave you one and you give me break downstream?

2934
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:34,160
When I woke up, the sun was already setting.

2935
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:36,160
I still feel so lazy after sleeping so much.

2936
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:37,160
Can I just sleep forever?

2937
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:40,160
You're probably feeling what's known as the side effects.

2938
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,160
I'm sorry.

2939
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:43,160
Can I just sleep forever?

2940
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,160
Rest for a turn eight?

2941
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:45,160
No.

2942
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:46,160
Sure.

2943
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:48,160
Do you want to sleep again?

2944
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:50,160
That means I don't have to bother living in it.

2945
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,160
Is she off on or not?

2946
02:01:57,160 --> 02:01:59,160
I think she may be off on or not.

2947
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:07,160
Is she okay?

2948
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:11,160
I don't think we should have done that one.

2949
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:13,160
Oh, she can go out!

2950
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:20,160
Oh, but who's fricking affectionate?

2951
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:21,160
Wait, Akihabara.

2952
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:25,160
Let's visit nerd culture, popular with young people.

2953
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:26,160
Young people?

2954
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:27,160
Oh, this is actually really cool.

2955
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:28,160
So can we map?

2956
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:31,160
Disneyland?

2957
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:35,160
Akihabara?

2958
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:36,160
Akihabara?

2959
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:39,160
Shinjuku?

2960
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:41,160
Wait, so it says Shinjuku, but I can't...

2961
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:42,160
Alright, okay, okay, okay.

2962
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:47,160
Maybe that's where our politician...

2963
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,160
I forgot sick women!

2964
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:53,160
Give me politician!

2965
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:54,160
Just go to sleep!

2966
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:55,160
Just go...

2967
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,160
Give me politician!

2968
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,160
Just sleep one more time.

2969
02:02:57,160 --> 02:02:58,160
We're going to stream you absolutely to...

2970
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:59,160
It fails tomorrow.

2971
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:04,160
The moment I go to bed,

2972
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:06,160
all these horrible memories come flooding back to me.

2973
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:09,160
Oh, because you're on 28A, darkness?

2974
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:11,160
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

2975
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:12,160
Oh, that's so sad.

2976
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:14,160
Oh, no, you can't...

2977
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:16,160
Oh, wait!

2978
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:18,160
There actually is an Ace of Arc category!

2979
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:22,160
Oh, that's so cool.

2980
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:24,160
Okay, that's really cool.

2981
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:26,160
How cool is it tomorrow?

2982
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:29,160
My silver award is getting for your fur.

2983
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:30,160
That's amazing.

2984
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:31,160
Okay, that's really good.

2985
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:33,160
Wait, but there's actually Ace of Arc.

2986
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:35,160
Oh, you're so fantastic.

2987
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:36,160
Oh, my God!

2988
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:40,160
You need to reach 80 mental darkness to prove...

2989
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,160
Aww!

2990
02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:45,160
How...

2991
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:48,160
I need to make her mentally...

2992
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:50,160
You want mental darkness?

2993
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,160
80?

2994
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:53,160
That's so bad.

2995
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:54,160
How do I do that?

2996
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:57,160
That's terrible.

2997
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:58,160
How do I do that?

2998
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,160
Is it this one?

2999
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:02,160
Is it this one?

3000
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:06,160
Oh, I really wanted to do the fricking...

3001
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:08,160
I wanted her to be a God.

3002
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:10,160
But all these...

3003
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:13,160
I'm going to run out of time in order to...

3004
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,160
Oh, sugar.

3005
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:16,160
I didn't read that in time.

3006
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,160
Aww.

3007
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:23,160
Aww.

3008
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:26,160
Mental darkness?

3009
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:30,160
Okay, that's so cool.

3010
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:31,160
Love it.

3011
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:32,160
Bye.

3012
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:34,160
Netlord.

3013
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:35,160
