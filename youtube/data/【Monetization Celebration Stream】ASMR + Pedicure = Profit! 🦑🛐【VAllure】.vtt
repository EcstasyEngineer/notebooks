06:42.720 --> 06:45.720
Oh, Bay Odex, Plastic Ghost.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.720
I'm not going to actually have to do ASMR between them.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.720
Oh my god, hold on.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.720
There's a few tools like all that are like required,

06:54.720 --> 06:59.720
real ambidextrous, but like crack pipes,

06:59.720 --> 07:03.720
come on, oh shit.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.720
Hold on, hold on, I can do this.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.720
I'm actually having a problem with this toe, by the way.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.720
I don't know what the lady did, but I think it's contracted

07:12.720 --> 07:14.720
and I might have to go with the doctor about it,

07:14.720 --> 07:17.720
because something's not right.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.720
I cleaned the wound today,

07:20.720 --> 07:22.720
and something's definitely not right,

07:22.720 --> 07:25.720
but can we even get it to bloop?

07:25.720 --> 07:29.720
Wait, hold on.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.720
It's not blooping.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.720
I can't do this.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.720
It's a crazy amount of team effort to get this to bloop.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.720
Hold on.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.720
Oh, come on.

07:40.720 --> 07:45.720
It's not turning over because of the way my feet are.

07:45.720 --> 07:49.720
Oh my god, I figured it out.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.720
Oh my god, a little toe just cracked.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.720
Oh shit.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.720
I'm going to be sorry if I get my dissent today.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.720
That took me so long.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.720
I also brought pop rocks to prove how sweaty my feet are.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.720
I want to see if my feet sweat, can make them pop,

08:05.720 --> 08:08.720
although just the feet sweat, nothing else.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.720
I just realized I'm really covering that up,

08:11.720 --> 08:13.720
so let me go over here.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.720
Look, it's my feet.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.720
Oh yeah, I also have a PC cleaner.

08:18.720 --> 08:22.720
These are used for fan board type things,

08:22.720 --> 08:26.720
but you need to squeeze them to get the air out.

08:26.720 --> 08:34.720
So yeah, I brought a lot of tools to try and get rid of the freaking feet.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.720
I also got the frog thing.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.720
It goes like...

08:39.720 --> 08:53.720
Yeah, it's into the frog.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.720
I ain't working that one, hold on.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.720
Okay, I'll try and say more names.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.720
I'm so sorry.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.720
I'm very flustered when it comes to these kinds of streams.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.720
I feel a little pressured, like...

09:09.720 --> 09:11.720
How are you so good with your feet?

09:11.720 --> 09:16.720
I don't know, how are you not so good with your feet?

09:16.720 --> 09:22.720
I'm trying not to knock over the webcam.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.720
We'll do this.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.720
We'll try and say some names, okay?

09:26.720 --> 09:29.720
Although next, plastic goes,

09:29.720 --> 09:32.720
ceruto, cookie, fungler, kids and gamer.

09:32.720 --> 09:37.720
I've reluctantly said sakura and koku,

09:37.720 --> 09:45.720

09:45.720 --> 09:51.720
dragon karma, toasty reef oracle, rikos,

09:51.720 --> 09:56.720
voltage isaya, domino miku.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.720
Okay, that was what was done offline.

09:59.720 --> 10:03.720
Now what was done right now is freaking impossible to keep up with,

10:03.720 --> 10:06.720
but I'm going to try my best, doesn't mean I can't try.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.720
Okay, I'm going to try and keep up.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.720
Please bear with me.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.720
AC's in the room, bear with me.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.720
Okay.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.720
Could you wet...

10:15.720 --> 10:16.720
Huh?

10:16.720 --> 10:18.720
Could you...

10:18.720 --> 10:20.720
Man, I wish I had a little feet.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.720
Could you wet feet drying my...

10:23.720 --> 10:27.720
Well, I bought pop rocks to see if I can actually get them to pop with my feet sweat alone,

10:27.720 --> 10:30.720
which is pretty gross, but I thought it was really funny.

10:30.720 --> 10:35.720
Right, let me check where the new names come in.

10:35.720 --> 10:46.720
I think Zang, PV Mendes, Gaming Kitsune, Zarian, Outplayboy, Zero Bridge,

10:46.720 --> 10:51.720

10:51.720 --> 10:54.720
I recognize some of these names, hold on, I've already said them.

10:54.720 --> 10:59.720
Larry Twenty, Dejan Parma.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.720
Wait, I said these names.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.720
Oh no, I don't know where it starts.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.720
Viral, San Brulee, I said that too.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.720

11:09.720 --> 11:12.720

11:12.720 --> 11:15.720
Everyone get in the name right twice or like, yeah, that's right, forget,

11:15.720 --> 11:17.720
you better forget my name, yeah.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.720
I'm repeating sorry, I'm so sorry.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.720
Right, I think we're here.

11:21.720 --> 11:26.720

11:26.720 --> 11:32.720

11:32.720 --> 11:35.720
not Alessandro Tenspene,

11:35.720 --> 11:39.720
I don't know, I recognize I've already said these names.

11:39.720 --> 11:43.720
Oh my god, George, it's so hard for me.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.720
Are you getting ASMR at least?

11:47.720 --> 11:50.720
Congrats on monetization, thank you so much, I'm so sorry,

11:50.720 --> 11:53.720
I'm like really out of my element with these kind of streams.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.720
I'm not used to it.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.720
I don't know, I'm just used to it.

11:58.720 --> 12:02.720
Hopefully I can at least do some actual ASMR in a moment.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.720
I'm so sorry, I'm trying to catch up for a little.

12:05.720 --> 12:11.720
Tachio, Carbonai, I had nothing.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.720
Scarecrow, damn, okay, I don't recognize saying these.

12:14.720 --> 12:18.720
Blackwing, 757, why did that just change?

12:18.720 --> 12:23.720

12:23.720 --> 12:27.720
I'm a heron, size...

12:27.720 --> 12:30.720
Oh sorry, maybe your other ear should get something else.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.720
I freaking caught up, I don't know how we did it.

12:57.720 --> 13:01.720
Thank you so much for everyone who is becoming a member

13:01.720 --> 13:03.720
and being so fantastic.

13:03.720 --> 13:06.720
I'm completely out of my element, I do apologize,

13:06.720 --> 13:09.720
but yeah, you like that?

13:10.720 --> 13:13.720
But thank you so much for your support, you did it!

13:13.720 --> 13:15.720
Can you please scare him like that?

13:15.720 --> 13:17.720
I was gonna do a fake cam on Buckshot, really.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.720
I don't know if I have to go to a doctor about my toe

13:20.720 --> 13:22.720
because something is wrong with it,

13:22.720 --> 13:24.720
and I don't know what on Earth is going on.

13:24.720 --> 13:29.720
Oh she did, so on this toe, this bit here,

13:29.720 --> 13:32.720
she cut into like really deep,

13:32.720 --> 13:35.720
and I was like, oh no, it's fine, like accidents happen.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.720
It was a little bit painful, but I didn't think anything of it.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.720
And then it's actually pretty sore today,

13:41.720 --> 13:43.720
so I don't know if I have to get a check though.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.720
But yeah.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.720
The only good thing with your toe is it's not,

13:47.720 --> 13:50.720
the only thing wrong with your toe is it's not my max!

13:50.720 --> 13:53.720
Oh my goodness, okay, you're done.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.720
Scrumptious Nightmare, thank you.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.720

14:00.720 --> 14:03.720
Grampo, thank you for becoming a man, sir.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.720
Yeah, it's good, I do.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.720
You're not supposed to cut it at all,

14:06.720 --> 14:09.720
a lot of shops do it anyway, yeah.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.720
I think I may have got hurt a little bit, but it's okay.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.720
Turi, thank you.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.720
I appreciate it.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.720
Right, well let's see if we can open up Pop Rocks

14:20.720 --> 14:22.720
with their feet and get my feet swept

14:22.720 --> 14:24.720
to activate the Pop Rocks.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.720
This might be very loud actually, hold on.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.720
I'm going to take it a little bit away from you, okay?

14:29.720 --> 14:33.720
I don't know if I can do it with my feet till it's open.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.720
Anything is possible if you get your hands on it.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.720
So we have the...

14:42.720 --> 14:46.720
Grupper Repair Funds for 10, thank you so much.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.720
Oh wait, wasn't there a red?

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
Why is it not displaying?

14:48.720 --> 14:51.720
I could have sworn us all red earlier.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.720
It was a red.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.720
The Jingle of 100 in Celebration and Monetization

14:56.720 --> 14:58.720
are giving my first ever red symbol.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.720
Thank you, my goodness.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.720
Thank you so much.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.720
Do you guys think you better support the girls

15:05.720 --> 15:07.720
more than this, I can't say.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.720
Oh my God, I don't think I can rip it open.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.720
Hold on.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.720
Actually having to use my green power.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.720
Monkey Feet Goop.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.720
I can't see if there's like a green rip section on it.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.720
I can't see anything at all.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.720
That's why I've not turned my glasses.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.720
Okay, I'm trying to rip it open, but it's gonna work.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.720
Support the girls and the mama.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.720
You got my neurons.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.720
Congrats on the Monetization.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.720
Thank you.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.720
It really wasn't that hard in the nicest...

15:46.720 --> 15:48.720
Streams, Assets, Creed, Brotherhood and Nerds

15:48.720 --> 15:49.720
are about it.

15:49.720 --> 15:50.720
Oh yeah, no thank you.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.720
I've worked really hard for that.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.720
Diddy, thank you for becoming a member.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.720
Oh my God.

15:57.720 --> 15:58.720
Hi Rain.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.720
I am so sorry Rain, please don't look.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.720
It's not what it looks like Rain.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.720
It's a mistake, okay?

16:04.720 --> 16:06.720
Hi Rain.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.720
It really didn't mean anything.

16:08.720 --> 16:09.720
Thank you for the 10.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.720
Did you want to put down a pillow first or last?

16:11.720 --> 16:14.720
Nah, it's fine.

16:14.720 --> 16:19.720
The place I am renting the caskets

16:19.720 --> 16:22.720
weren't even cleaned before I moved in,

16:22.720 --> 16:25.720
so you get what you want back.

16:25.720 --> 16:26.720
Thanks.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.720
Thank you.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.720
I'll let...

16:33.720 --> 16:35.720
999, thank you for becoming a member.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.720
Okay, I don't think I'm gonna have to choose my hand.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.720
Sorry lads, hold on.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.720
Oh wait, I'll do it off camera.

16:41.720 --> 16:42.720
Watch this.

16:42.720 --> 16:43.720
Oh look at my toes go.

16:43.720 --> 16:44.720
Oh sorry.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.720
Oh sorry, my toes weren't in frame.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.720
Oh dear.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.720
Oh my toes weren't in frame.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.720
Oh you couldn't see that.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.720
Oh dear.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.720
But I did get them open.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.720
So, the way my feet sweat the most is in this section

16:56.720 --> 16:58.720
in between the toes,

16:58.720 --> 17:01.720
so this is what I'm basically gonna aim for.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.720
This is disgusting.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.720
If this actually pops, this is awful.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.720
If this genuinely pops because of my feet sweating,

17:08.720 --> 17:10.720
this is terrible.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.720
Okay, if the Spidey, thank you for becoming a member,

17:14.720 --> 17:17.720
if this pops, I'm actually gonna cry.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.720
I hope so it doesn't, but I'm at the same time anyway.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.720
Hold on.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.720
I need to sit on the floor for this.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.720
Ooh, I need to do this with my foot.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.720
As if this pops.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.720
I can't hold them in my toes.

17:37.720 --> 17:38.720
Did it pop?

17:38.720 --> 17:39.720
No, I thought I could do it.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.720
I think we're safe.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.720
I think we're safe.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.720
I can't do it.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.720
Wait, did it pop?

17:45.720 --> 17:46.720
No.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.720
Oh, hold on.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.720
I hear it, shut up.

17:53.720 --> 17:54.720
Did it pop?

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
It's popping.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.720
No, that's so gross.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.720
I'm gonna sweat my feet this way.

18:00.720 --> 18:01.720
Hold on.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.720
It popped.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.720
So now you're on the line about that.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.720
That's disgusting.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.720
But yeah, I got really sweaty feet.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.720
I also have sweaty hands, maybe I would do it with my hand.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.720
It's kind of the same thing where it's sweaty

18:29.720 --> 18:31.720
in between my fingers more.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
Salted feet.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.720
Why, you wanna lick them?

18:38.720 --> 18:39.720
Oh, wait.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.720
Oh no, it's getting sticky,

18:41.720 --> 18:42.720
because my feet are over.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.720
I never thought this far ahead.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.720
Why am I so low IQ?

18:47.720 --> 18:49.720
It's such a curse sometimes.

18:49.720 --> 18:50.720
Hold on.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.720
Thank you Esteban Lomiel,

18:56.720 --> 18:58.720
who I'm gonna remember.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.720
Thank you Colin.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.720
Four, three, one, six.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.720
And thank you Shalom Plain.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.720
She kinda dumb though.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.720
Sticky feet mean sticky floors.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.720
Oof.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.720
You put socks on after this stream.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.720
Oh, there's like bits and spots everywhere now.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.720
You know what?

19:20.720 --> 19:22.720
Maybe that reefling was right,

19:22.720 --> 19:24.720
and I should have put a towel down.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.720
Hold on, my sweaty hands are so sticky.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.720
They're sticking to my hands.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.720
Look, it's actually a benefit.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.720
It's actually a benefit, okay?

19:33.720 --> 19:36.720
You just have to think of the situation.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.720
Hold on.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.720
Let me just pop them up there.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.720
Our experiment has been conducted.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.720
Gross, I don't know.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.720
My ears have a pop rock sometimes.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.720
I'm trying to help.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.720
Actual squid behaviors.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.720
Honestly.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.720
This is welcome to the reefling membership tier,

19:58.720 --> 20:00.720
and this is message redacted.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.720
I don't know how, but here you go.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.720
Thank you Brayoko

20:08.720 --> 20:11.720
for the super chat.

20:12.720 --> 20:15.720
Oh my god, the super chat, because I'm monetized.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.720
Found your credit card.

20:17.720 --> 20:18.720
Congrats!

20:18.720 --> 20:20.720
Maybe don't...

20:20.720 --> 20:22.720
You don't have to support, by the way.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.720
I always have free membership streams all the time.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.720
Today we learned to always put damage up.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.720
Right, and we're going to actually do ASMR

20:30.720 --> 20:32.720
at the same time to hold up.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.720
This is your boy.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.720
This is ridiculous.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.720
My offer counts.

20:41.720 --> 20:44.720
Bull, I also got my Skyrim achievements to work.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.720
I have like 12% Skyrim achievements.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.720
I don't know why they weren't displayed,

20:48.720 --> 20:50.720
but we might be able to actually go back

20:50.720 --> 20:52.720
to the Skyrim stream at any time.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.720
Bull, I thank you for becoming the streamers.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.720
Totally bonkers.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.720
Congrats, new membership. Thank you.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.720
Thank you, boy, for being a member.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.720
Thank you, uh, Sithmans for coming to member as well.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.720
Yeah.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.720
Oh, you're getting tangled up in Wazir right now.

21:07.720 --> 21:08.720
Shhh.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.720
Next week, yeah.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.720
Our Endurance stream of the week is...

21:18.720 --> 21:20.720
Hold on, let me put these on, yeah.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.720
Thank you, uh, Shiori

21:24.720 --> 21:26.720
for becoming a member.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.720
And thank you, Dr. P, for becoming a member.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.720
Hold on, this is going to take some manipulation

21:33.720 --> 21:36.720
because this ear isn't sitting

21:36.720 --> 21:38.720
the way ears actually sit.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.720
Oh, wow, my feet are so talented.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.720
You look on Skyrim achievements

21:57.720 --> 22:00.720
and usually take, like, three streams

22:00.720 --> 22:01.720
unless your stream's super long.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.720
Yeah.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.720
I'm a bit of an Endurance streamer, okay?

22:05.720 --> 22:06.720
Shhh.

22:06.720 --> 22:07.720
ASMR.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.720
Thank you, Jay, for the membership.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.720
Thank you.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.720
Oh, woo-ee, for the membership.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.720
Oh, no, they're coming off.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.720
Shhh.

22:21.720 --> 22:22.720
Say, just say.

22:23.720 --> 22:24.720
Shhh.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.720
Well, those feet grew arms and hands out of nowhere.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.720
How about your next skill?

22:28.720 --> 22:30.720
Look, I'm going to say for the pod.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.720
I have eight arms, okay?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.720
How do you buy membership?

22:35.720 --> 22:36.720
Oh, you don't have to.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.720
There should be a join button,

22:37.720 --> 22:38.720
but it doesn't work everywhere,

22:38.720 --> 22:39.720
so don't worry if you can't buy.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.720
I always have free streams coming out

22:41.720 --> 22:46.720
and the membership streams start next week.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.720
Not this week,

22:48.720 --> 22:50.720
because by the end of this week

22:50.720 --> 22:53.720
I'll have everything in place

22:53.720 --> 22:55.720
work-wise so I only have to do shorts.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.720
And I'm very glad.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.720
I am so glad that all the responsibility

22:59.720 --> 23:01.720
is taken off me.

23:01.720 --> 23:04.720
And I'm just a normal stromer.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.720
We should have changed all our names

23:06.720 --> 23:09.720
into Jamal for the stream,

23:09.720 --> 23:11.720
knowing beforehand you would have said

23:11.720 --> 23:12.720
every person.

23:12.720 --> 23:15.720
We should have one reflame.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.720
It's all arms anyway.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
The logic checks out

23:18.720 --> 23:21.720
and definitely isn't influenced by the membership.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.720
And the join button is sometimes

23:24.720 --> 23:26.720
not next to subscription on mobile.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.720
Yeah, I guess if you're in the phone.

23:28.720 --> 23:29.720
But don't worry,

23:29.720 --> 23:30.720
you don't have to directly support me.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.720
I'll always have free streams coming out

23:32.720 --> 23:34.720
like all the time.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.720
I'm not kidding.

23:36.720 --> 23:40.720
You can't take me off.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.720
Come on.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.720
You can't.

23:42.720 --> 23:43.720
It's not possible.

23:43.720 --> 23:44.720
Okay?

23:44.720 --> 23:46.720
So don't try and take me off.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.720
Bless the shimi.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.720
Thank you very much.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.720
Remember?

23:53.720 --> 23:57.720
Are you doing me with my dog?

23:57.720 --> 23:59.720
Are you doing hypnosis soon?

24:00.720 --> 24:01.720
Not right now.

24:01.720 --> 24:02.720
No.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
No of these.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.720
I don't think anyone can get hypnotized

24:05.720 --> 24:06.720
by fricking toes.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.720
You can see how opaque my skin is.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.720
You can see my blue veins.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.720
Check them veins out.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.720
You can literally see them.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.720
I have my little tendons.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.720
If you look hard enough for them.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.720
Oh, there they are.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.720
Look at them tendons.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.720
Thank you for the tip.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.720
I'll hold on a string on the swing.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.720
Did Brian talk?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.720
Did Brian say anything?

24:33.720 --> 24:35.720
I hope not.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.720
Oh, it's kind of working.

24:39.720 --> 24:40.720
Okay.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.720
Stream element says no.

24:42.720 --> 24:43.720
Kind of working.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.720
Mika's big fan.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.720
Thank you for the five gifted memberships.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.720
And then Boyce the Trigger

24:50.720 --> 24:54.720
wore just purple burglar alarm honestly.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.720
Brian said it but he was quiet.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.720
Good.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.720
I'm glad he didn't say it.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.720
I did not say no.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.720
Bejinga.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.720
In celebration, I gave my first ever ritz.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.720
Yes, I did.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.720
I'm so sorry.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.720
I'm very scared of brain right now.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.720
Secret, thank you for becoming a member.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.720
This is the craziest ASMR concept.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.720
It's not even ASMR, let's be honest.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.720
I'm just dumb.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.720
I'm just dumb for you.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.720
I'm from a field.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.720
Thank you.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.720
Thank you.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.720
What?

25:39.720 --> 25:41.720
At their name?

25:41.720 --> 25:42.720
At their...

25:42.720 --> 25:46.720
Strony, I just want to stream what I want and enjoy.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.720
Corporals, you can't do that.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.720
You'll never be successful.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.720
Strony, who my beer makes whole companies

25:50.720 --> 25:52.720
have life-mangered people to stream with.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.720
I cannot tell you how unbelievably nice it is.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.720
Thank you for that type of thing.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.720
I cannot tell you how unbelievably nice it is

26:01.720 --> 26:03.720
to have like-minded individuals,

26:03.720 --> 26:05.720
knowing gays are rats.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.720
I jumped on my alternative Twitter

26:08.720 --> 26:10.720
and was listening to the feed.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.720
I'm just sitting listening to A.C. Tinkle

26:13.720 --> 26:16.720
and I'm just like, yeah, this is actually quite good quality.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.720
Honestly, I wouldn't mind if she brought a 3D one there.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.720
It is so nice to have like-minded individuals

26:22.720 --> 26:25.720
that are like, yeah, let's provide the goods.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.720
We say no to blue-balling here, okay?

26:28.720 --> 26:30.720
You ask and you receive, okay?

26:30.720 --> 26:33.720
You ask other agencies, you get donor-walled.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.720
Hold on, I'm going to take a drink of water.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.720
I'm going to put dehydrate.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.720
Please take a drink of it now.

26:40.720 --> 26:52.720
P.L.U.R. allegations are yet to be resolved.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.720
I will make a public statement about the P.L.U.R. allegations.

26:55.720 --> 26:59.720
As you can see, we're in very hot water about the P.L.U.R. allegations.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.720
What is donor-walled?

27:02.720 --> 27:07.720
Donor-walled is when someone gives a streamer a lot of money

27:07.720 --> 27:11.720
via a donation and the streamer doesn't read it out loud

27:11.720 --> 27:13.720
for whatever reason it may be.

27:13.720 --> 27:14.720
They genuinely missed it.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.720
That's very plausible.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.720
They don't want to acknowledge it

27:17.720 --> 27:19.720
because of maybe the contents,

27:19.720 --> 27:21.720
but donor-walled is the term

27:21.720 --> 27:25.720
when someone gives over money and still gets the money.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.720
That's beyond.

27:27.720 --> 27:32.720
Thank you for becoming a member.

27:32.720 --> 27:36.720
Good luck with the P.L.U.R. campaign.

27:36.720 --> 27:45.720
Mi-Win-Jin 2 comes out of the P.L.U.R. campaign.

27:45.720 --> 27:51.720
P.L.U.R. is the best station in the world.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.720
Okay, I genuinely think I managed to catch up to everyone.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.720
Thank you so much for all of the love and support.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.720
I'm really overwhelmed right now

27:59.720 --> 28:01.720
and I feel so out of my element.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.720
I'm like, oh my god, what do I do?

28:05.720 --> 28:09.720
I figured out what I do to P.L.U.R.

28:09.720 --> 28:14.720
Right, so you may notice that my tier 2 is $4.99.

28:14.720 --> 28:18.720
I don't think it can be gifted unless on purpose, right?

28:18.720 --> 28:22.720
Like, can you not just manually put in gift $1.99?

28:22.720 --> 28:26.720
Internet-baz of fees.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.720
Thank you for the member.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.720
Hold on, I'm trying so hard to do this.

28:30.720 --> 28:34.720
The P.L.U.R. needs to rehire a P.L.U.R. position.

28:34.720 --> 28:35.720
A P.L.U.R. position.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.720
Oh, jeez.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.720
This is embarrassing, I can't grip it.

28:43.720 --> 28:44.720
Oh, there we go.

28:44.720 --> 28:45.720
Surprise, surprise.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.720
If you use two feet, you can grip it really well.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.720
Jeremy, thank you for coming to member.

28:51.720 --> 28:55.720
I'm so sorry to end when I'm alienating right now in this room.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.720
Literally, this is getting...

28:57.720 --> 28:58.720
Come on, please.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.720
Okay, here we go.

29:01.720 --> 29:02.720
We'll do it like this.

29:05.720 --> 29:06.720
Wow, Asterix.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.720
Thank you for the five gifted members.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.720
Did it do a moose?

29:11.720 --> 29:13.720
You guys have a moose now.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.720
Jake, Jake said pre-looked grippers.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.720
Let's go, honestly.

29:20.720 --> 29:21.720
Okay, just that.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.720
I'm gonna put it like that.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.720
Oh, there we go.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.720
We got it.

29:29.720 --> 29:30.720
Oh my god, we got it.

29:32.720 --> 29:33.720
The Dexterix.

29:34.720 --> 29:35.720
Just admit it.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.720
Just admit it.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.720
No other streamer is even capable of doing this physically,

29:40.720 --> 29:42.720
because they wouldn't be able to do it.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.720
This is absolutely staggering.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.720
Did anyone take a...

29:50.720 --> 29:53.720
Or is everyone just blown away by this

29:53.720 --> 29:55.720
even being a streamer concept?

29:56.720 --> 29:58.720
Do you know how long I planned this for?

29:58.720 --> 30:00.720
I planned this for...

30:01.720 --> 30:03.720
I planned this

30:04.720 --> 30:06.720
back when I was concepted

30:06.720 --> 30:08.720
to have French tits and nails,

30:08.720 --> 30:10.720
which is absolutely awful.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.720
I've been waiting months on this idea

30:13.720 --> 30:15.720
to utilize it.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.720
Man is up one.

30:16.720 --> 30:17.720
Thank you for...

30:20.720 --> 30:22.720
Right, can I do two at once?

30:23.720 --> 30:24.720
I think I can.

30:26.720 --> 30:27.720
Hold them by the bottom.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.720
Oh, this is...

30:31.720 --> 30:32.720
Hold on.

30:33.720 --> 30:34.720
We're losing them.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.720
My feet are so sweaty that they're...

30:37.720 --> 30:38.720
Right, they're up,

30:38.720 --> 30:39.720
and then...

30:39.720 --> 30:41.720
Oh, they're up a bit too much.

30:44.720 --> 30:45.720
I can do this chat.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.720
Let me do it.

30:49.720 --> 30:50.720
Does that even work?

30:51.720 --> 30:53.720
Oh, my ankle just cracked.

30:53.720 --> 30:54.720
Did you hear that?

30:54.720 --> 30:56.720
Literally jewel-wielding the tingles right now.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.720
We're in uncharted territory.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.720
I'll forget to say, why can I not do it with that one?

31:05.720 --> 31:09.720
I wonder if the plaster is actually helping me grip this one.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.720
I'm jewel-wielding tingles.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.720
Why?

31:15.720 --> 31:17.720
I think my feet are actually getting too sweaty

31:17.720 --> 31:19.720
to pick this up because it's glass.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.720
I think I'm gonna have to take off.

31:23.720 --> 31:24.720
Right.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.720
I think I'm literally...

31:27.720 --> 31:29.720
Hold on, we'll just go the brush.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.720
Calm, calm.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.720
The migraine, thank you for becoming a member.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.720
I appreciate it.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.720
If this isn't peak streaming, I don't know what is.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.720
Honestly, like, which year...

31:44.720 --> 31:45.720
Which year's...

31:45.720 --> 31:46.720
Where the heck is my other...

31:46.720 --> 31:47.720
Oh, here.

31:48.720 --> 31:49.720
Hold on, I'm cheating.

31:49.720 --> 31:50.720
Just a little bit.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.720
Jewel-wield brushes.

31:54.720 --> 31:55.720
Come on.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.720
Come on, admit it.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.720
It's just so hard to do because of the ankle.

32:00.720 --> 32:01.720
Oh, there we go.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.720
I just need to relax the gripper.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.720
ASMR.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.720
I'm impressed.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.720
Did you watch the new Echo Showcase?

32:13.720 --> 32:15.720
Apparently Fable 4 is coming out.

32:15.720 --> 32:16.720
Wait, hold on a second.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.720
I'm gonna just grip it sideways.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.720
Ta-da.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.720
We love joe feet wielding tingles.

32:22.720 --> 32:23.720
I bet you do.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.720
Wah, thank you for becoming a member.

32:26.720 --> 32:27.720
Yay, Fable.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.720
But they were saying...

32:29.720 --> 32:31.720
And apparently the new Dragon Age Origins

32:31.720 --> 32:34.720
has, like, a ton of little G-fans really mad

32:34.720 --> 32:35.720
because there's something wrong with that.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.720
Like, how do you fix them then?

32:37.720 --> 32:39.720
Oh, and my feet are actually too...

32:39.720 --> 32:40.720
Getting too sweaty.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.720
Correct the shit.

32:41.720 --> 32:42.720
Hold on.

32:43.720 --> 32:44.720
I need my pinkie.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.720
I need my pinkie to join in on the grip.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.720
I need my gripper.

32:54.720 --> 32:57.720
She's put maxing on food?

32:57.720 --> 32:58.720
I am.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.720
From a two-handed build in Skyrim to a joe wield build

33:05.720 --> 33:07.720
the next day, so talented.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.720
I know.

33:08.720 --> 33:09.720
I know.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.720
Isn't it amazing?

33:11.720 --> 33:14.720
God, look at the gel shine on that big toe.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.720
Oh, look at that shine.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.720
Oh, that's gorgeous.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.720
I admire my own feet.

33:20.720 --> 33:21.720
Yes, I do.

33:21.720 --> 33:22.720
And such cool.

33:22.720 --> 33:25.720
Rosso, thank you for becoming a member.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.720
Omen.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.720
So then thank you for becoming a member.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.720
Oh, my ring light there.

33:34.720 --> 33:38.720
That's what's lighting up the deck under here

33:38.720 --> 33:40.720
because it's all dark.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.720
So that's what the gel polish is doing.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.720
Delicious brown waifu.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.720
Thank you for becoming a member.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.720
Not 3DO, it should have been me.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.720
Hammerfell is going to come in 2026 if we're lucky.

34:00.720 --> 34:04.720
I'll be so interested to see if I'll enjoy the game or not.

34:04.720 --> 34:08.720
It might be one of those games where I have to play offline for the first time

34:08.720 --> 34:10.720
to even appreciate it.

34:10.720 --> 34:15.720
I don't know if you ever, like, you know, your first play through of a game,

34:15.720 --> 34:17.720
you're so silent and so quiet

34:17.720 --> 34:20.720
because you're just experiencing it for the first time.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.720
So I feel like it would be hard to commentate.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.720
Like, I really want to play Big Bobby's Gate,

34:24.720 --> 34:26.720
but I'm worried I won't have a thought,

34:26.720 --> 34:29.720
like a single thought formed because I've never played it before.

34:32.720 --> 34:36.720
I'm sad I can't hear, but the visuals, the visuals, though.

34:36.720 --> 34:38.720
Yeah, you like the visuals.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.720
Can I do the middle finger on a toe?

34:40.720 --> 34:41.720
Hold on.

34:41.720 --> 34:42.720
Can I?

34:42.720 --> 34:44.720
No, I'll just put this down.

34:44.720 --> 34:47.720
And then bring you back up again.

34:47.720 --> 34:49.720
And then everyone go down.

34:49.720 --> 34:50.720
Oh, no, it's not going to work.

34:50.720 --> 34:51.720
I don't have that kind of...

34:51.720 --> 34:53.720
I don't have that kind of toe deck, though.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.720
You have the kind where I can, like, grip around and stuff.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.720
My appendages.

34:59.720 --> 35:00.720
My appendages.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.720
I'm actually tempted to leave these on

35:02.720 --> 35:05.720
because it's helping to muffle me making any mistakes.

35:06.720 --> 35:07.720
Crying.

35:08.720 --> 35:09.720
Shimmer pants.

35:11.720 --> 35:12.720
Thank you for the time.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.720
Congrats on monetization, Stony.

35:14.720 --> 35:15.720
Thank you!

35:15.720 --> 35:17.720
Like, we had a direct support.

35:17.720 --> 35:21.720
A fan made more remaster of oblivion made in Scourge Engine

35:21.720 --> 35:23.720
is coming out to it with us.

35:23.720 --> 35:24.720
Cue.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.720
I do a little tapping these more.

35:27.720 --> 35:31.720
It feels like I don't have the dexterity to do the frog thing.

35:31.720 --> 35:35.720
If Wolves and Gromit aren't becoming cranes of beyond on our fellow...

35:35.720 --> 35:38.720
Oh, does a Wolves and Gromit thing come out?

35:38.720 --> 35:40.720
How far can your tanky pool?

35:40.720 --> 35:41.720
What do you mean, far?

35:41.720 --> 35:43.720
I can only go like this.

35:48.720 --> 35:49.720
Sky Blivion.

35:51.720 --> 35:52.720
Get Nordid.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.720
Get Nordid.

35:53.720 --> 35:54.720
Get Nordid.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.720
Hmm.

35:56.720 --> 36:00.720
It's commonly referred to as Sky Blivion by the project workers.

36:00.720 --> 36:01.720
Aren't they not...

36:01.720 --> 36:04.720
Wouldn't they not get a season to say that they're doing that?

36:06.720 --> 36:07.720
What's going on?

36:09.720 --> 36:10.720
Cup your ears.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.720
I'm cupping your ears.

36:14.720 --> 36:17.720
There's also a mod project that makes all of Nen...

36:18.720 --> 36:19.720
Nen?

36:19.720 --> 36:23.720
I would love if the Morrowind remake would come out, but we will hope.

36:24.720 --> 36:25.720
Cheese, Gromit.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.720
I'm sure there's a new Wolves and Gromit thing coming out.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.720
I don't know if it's a movie or what.

36:30.720 --> 36:34.720
Because everyone was like, oh, a new Wolves and Gromit before GTA 6.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.720
No, because it's fantastic.

36:37.720 --> 36:38.720
Fanmade mods are free.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.720
Ah, that's how they got away with it.

36:42.720 --> 36:46.720
But this, it doesn't actually get up a day about mods and assets they pack.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.720
Fallout 3 and New Vegas are fine.

36:49.720 --> 36:54.720
What were the accusations that Fallout 4 got the most useless update recently?

36:54.720 --> 36:58.720
And it was to spite modders to break them all or something?

36:58.720 --> 37:01.720
Was that Fallout 4 or did I make that up?

37:03.720 --> 37:08.720
The amount of complete reworks on this current engine is crazy.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.720
Danny Elorma make volume, by the way.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.720
It keeps peaking red.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.720
But...

37:20.720 --> 37:25.720
Yeah, they had more than they would hope their studio got burned or other stuff and more.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.720
I'm playing Fallout 4 right now.

37:34.720 --> 37:39.720
The update Fallout 4 due to the show, and it broke all the mods and the mods.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.720
Oh, okay, that makes more sense.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.720
That makes it feel good.

37:43.720 --> 37:49.720
Okay, it keeps peaking red and I'm like, am I, am I, am I grippers to OP for this microphone right now?

37:54.720 --> 37:55.720
Wow.

37:55.720 --> 37:56.720
Hmm.

37:57.720 --> 38:00.720
Peter, Salis, whose voice grew on it passed away.

38:00.720 --> 38:01.720
Oh.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.720
I guess I don't have to get a fan, do I?

38:08.720 --> 38:09.720
That sounds good.

38:09.720 --> 38:10.720
I'm glad.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.720
I thought right, my ears are fine, my ears are fine.

38:13.720 --> 38:14.720
Good.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.720
Just so you know, for the replays, this isn't an endurance stream.

38:19.720 --> 38:24.720
I'm very out of my element with the webcam on and I'm like...

38:25.720 --> 38:27.720
Okay, now what?

38:28.720 --> 38:29.720
I'm like, okay.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.720
But thank you so, so much to everyone who's membering.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.720
Thank you so, so much to everyone who's super-chan or tiffin or anything.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.720
It's such a fantastic help.

38:40.720 --> 38:49.720
Like, obviously I don't want to say too much, but, you know, it takes a year to create a new generation, so this is very reassuring.

38:50.720 --> 38:55.720
If there may or may not be some plans in the background, ho, ho, ho.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.720
We love mommy, love you, Eastling.

38:58.720 --> 38:59.720
Thank you, seriously.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.720
Like, I'm a bit overwhelmed.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.720
Like, I literally have my hands like this because I'm like, oh, okay.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.720
I was nervous.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.720
Like, I don't know what to do.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.720
I was nervous to sleep.

39:10.720 --> 39:11.720
Genius idea, please.

39:11.720 --> 39:19.720
I was going to do a photo-cam stream on Buckshot Relay and then you guys can tell me to put my feet back on the floor because I always sit on them.

39:25.720 --> 39:26.720
Absolutely.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.720
There were the scores last, literally.

39:29.720 --> 39:30.720
Thank you.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.720
Yes, I just filled out my element.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.720
I'm like, I'm used to meme-ing.

39:34.720 --> 39:38.720
I'm used to, well, I guess the stream is a big meme, to be honest.

39:38.720 --> 39:43.720
I don't need to put that much, like, what's the word, that much.

39:43.720 --> 39:52.720
I did bring, I know everyone is tired of Japanese youth cleaning tools, and it gets done today, but it's true.

39:53.720 --> 39:58.720
Thank you, Tiko Suwabi, for becoming a member.

39:58.720 --> 40:00.720
I can't pick this up, hold on.

40:00.720 --> 40:04.720
Thank you, Berenice Yuzette, for becoming a member.

40:04.720 --> 40:08.720
And thank you, Eleka Riaz.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.720
Wow, sorry I'm late.

40:12.720 --> 40:13.720
No need to be sorry at all.

40:13.720 --> 40:14.720
Thank you for becoming a member.

40:14.720 --> 40:16.720
Forgiveness sake.

40:16.720 --> 40:20.720
When it's really thin, it's so hard to grip.

40:20.720 --> 40:21.720
Seriously.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.720
This is, like, outrageously thin, right?

40:23.720 --> 40:26.720
I'm not going to need to, like, bring it closer.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.720
And then, I need to take this off gently, if I can even do that.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.720
That's right, you're cleaning via foot, or whatever.

40:36.720 --> 40:41.720
Ah, Internet, Bazoo, File, Mealtalk, it's cool to see you willing to be able to,

40:41.720 --> 40:44.720
it's a challenge, even with a handful of people, much less.

40:44.720 --> 40:49.720
300, eh, 300, that's like 600, throwing money, literally.

40:49.720 --> 40:55.720
I'm definitely not a handcam streamer, I don't think I, I don't, don't expect any footcam, handcam.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.720
After this, I'm going to be honest, I'm like, oh, it's not for me.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.720
Right, we're going to do this as gently as possible, okay?

41:03.720 --> 41:04.720
Gentle.

41:06.720 --> 41:11.720
Thank you for coming to my ear cleaning foot spa experience.

41:14.720 --> 41:17.720
I ran through, thank you for becoming a member.

41:17.720 --> 41:24.720
Now just let the brush slowly glide across your ear.

41:26.720 --> 41:30.720
And as the brush cleans the outer ear, hold on.

41:31.720 --> 41:35.720
You will find yourself, hold on, and relax.

41:42.720 --> 41:44.720
Just like this.

41:45.720 --> 41:49.720
Instructional ASMR, just let me ASMR you.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.720
Oh yeah, that's right, that's the money shot.

41:52.720 --> 41:57.720
That's so hard to, to, I'm tripping, my poor pinky.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.720
Look how hard my pinky is trying right now.

41:59.720 --> 42:03.720
My pinky is like going to France without hard as trying.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.720
You can't be feetlings anymore.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.720
After the stream, I don't think you're feetlings.

42:14.720 --> 42:19.720
I think I'll stick to the VTuber model because I'm like so nervous with the webcam on.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.720
Plastic girl, thank you for the 10.

42:22.720 --> 42:27.720
If you like feet though, Emmy's doing foot cam stream later this week, okay?

42:27.720 --> 42:30.720
Emmy Bezu, her link is in the description.

42:30.720 --> 42:35.720
Subscribe and hit the bell if you are into feet because she's, oh, I just dropped it.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.720
I don't even notice I dropped it, hold on.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.720
Right, and then pass it to this one.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.720
This is my strong foot, take my strong foot.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.720
Refling, take my strong foot.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.720
Refling, no, don't fall, grab onto my foot.

42:53.720 --> 42:55.720
Grab onto my French pedicure foot.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.720
French pedicure pedicure.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.720
Thank you.

42:59.720 --> 43:02.720
Ruin desolations, as I remember.

43:02.720 --> 43:04.720
Thank you, jargon hearts, for becoming a member.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.720
This is literally my left foot.

43:07.720 --> 43:10.720
Unless, unless I hold it like a pencil.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.720
Hold on, I need to like dab it against myself.

43:14.720 --> 43:21.720
Just know whenever you hear ear cleaning in my ASMR role plays, it's not done by my hands.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.720
It's done by my foot.

43:23.720 --> 43:25.720
Foot holding him.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.720
Thank you everyone for memberships and supporting me.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.720
I appreciate it.

43:31.720 --> 43:41.720
We are testing if tier two needs to be higher than 4.99 US dollars.

43:41.720 --> 43:44.720
But I don't think it has to be.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.720
Not from what I've seen.

43:49.720 --> 43:52.720
Oh no, it's dropped again, jeez.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.720
This is really difficult.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.720
I thought I had a bit more.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.720
I think because it's so thin.

44:00.720 --> 44:01.720
Okay, there we go.

44:01.720 --> 44:02.720
This is easy.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.720
It's gone again, jeez.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.720
I'm going to have to joe wield this.

44:09.720 --> 44:12.720
Double the twos, honestly.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.720
B, yaku.

44:15.720 --> 44:16.720
G, yaku.

44:16.720 --> 44:17.720
Thank you for the membership.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.720
I appreciate it.

44:18.720 --> 44:19.720
Right, we're swapping.

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
We're swapping.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.720
I can't do this anymore.

44:21.720 --> 44:23.720
Okay, let's do the bubbles.

44:23.720 --> 44:25.720
I said let's do the bubbles.

44:28.720 --> 44:32.720
This is the most bizarre monetization celebration I've ever seen.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.720
I've actually outdone myself.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.720
I've actually surprised myself.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.720
Weird, this concept.

44:39.720 --> 44:40.720
Can the bubbles come?

44:44.720 --> 44:46.720
Sorry, that was probably really loud.

44:46.720 --> 44:47.720
I'm so sorry.

44:48.720 --> 44:55.720
I hope no one's actually consuming this stream at a level of loud ASMR.

44:55.720 --> 44:58.720
No, don't listen to the stream at ASMR levels.

44:58.720 --> 44:59.720
Don't be silly.

44:59.720 --> 45:01.720
My skull, we're faked.

45:01.720 --> 45:04.720
Okay, I was going to say don't be silly and listen at ASMR levels.

45:04.720 --> 45:06.720
My feet are literally the pilot.

45:06.720 --> 45:10.720
You're telling me you trust my feet not to ever make a blip.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.720
I know my ear drum's still there.

45:12.720 --> 45:13.720
Ow, my ear.

45:13.720 --> 45:14.720
Yeah, no.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.720
Don't listen at ASMR levels.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.720
Don't be silly and listen.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.720
It's absolutely no way.

45:20.720 --> 45:28.720
Right, so for some reason stream elements can see when you guys gift other people,

45:28.720 --> 45:31.720
but it won't register a membership if you bought it yourself.

45:31.720 --> 45:33.720
I don't know why.

45:34.720 --> 45:38.720
You're kicking into my CPUs ASMR?

45:38.720 --> 45:40.720
That's terrible.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.720
Fiat, thank you for becoming a member.

45:43.720 --> 45:46.720
Is your name Fiat for a particular reason in the stream?

45:54.720 --> 45:55.720
That's strange.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.720
Yeah, I don't know why.

45:56.720 --> 46:00.720
I'm not going to lie to you, your voice overpowers any sound.

46:00.720 --> 46:04.720
I could have heard so far would need a different session.

46:08.720 --> 46:12.720
Hi, Stony, congrats on unlock and monetization.

46:12.720 --> 46:13.720
Thank you.

46:15.720 --> 46:17.720
I was thinking you can find yourself.

46:17.720 --> 46:18.720
Oh, thank you.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.720
Member just for anyone listening.

46:20.720 --> 46:22.720
You don't actually have to member, by the way.

46:22.720 --> 46:25.720
I always have free content coming up, so please don't worry.

46:25.720 --> 46:29.720
Please make sure you look after yourself first such as you pay off your debts

46:29.720 --> 46:34.720
because we live in a society and if you're debt free, it's good for you,

46:34.720 --> 46:36.720
but bad for society.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.720
But we can get into that in another stream.

46:38.720 --> 46:42.720
John07, thank you for the membership.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.720
I appreciate it.

46:43.720 --> 46:45.720
Sorry about all the camera glitching, by the way.

46:45.720 --> 46:50.720
This is a very dusty webcam.

46:50.720 --> 46:52.720
A very dusty.

46:52.720 --> 46:55.720
Nero, thank you for becoming a member.

46:55.720 --> 46:59.720
Nero2276, I was supposed to say your phone number.

46:59.720 --> 47:01.720
The camera's fine.

47:04.720 --> 47:06.720
Peppermint.

47:06.720 --> 47:07.720
Did I say that right?

47:07.720 --> 47:08.720
Peppermint.

47:08.720 --> 47:10.720
There's no R.

47:10.720 --> 47:15.720
Okay, ah, you never mind.

47:15.720 --> 47:16.720
Okay, never mind.

47:16.720 --> 47:18.720
Oh, we got there in the end.

47:18.720 --> 47:22.720
Don't worry, Stony, even if we get our ears bumped, you're still the best put stream.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.720
Ah, is that my new title now?

47:24.720 --> 47:27.720
Like the best put streamer?

47:27.720 --> 47:29.720
I would honestly take that title.

47:29.720 --> 47:31.720
I'm quite happy with that title.

47:36.720 --> 47:37.720
It's all right.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.720
My feet are here to comfort you.

47:40.720 --> 47:47.720
When it has been a long day, my sweaty grippers are here to pretend to tangle you

47:47.720 --> 47:49.720
because let's be honest, this isn't an ASMR stream.

47:49.720 --> 47:52.720
No one believes at all this is an ASMR stream.

47:52.720 --> 47:58.720
Just because you have the 3D view, it doesn't make it an ASMR stream.

47:58.720 --> 48:06.720
Which is why the title's called Monetization Celebration Stream and not ASMR.

48:06.720 --> 48:07.720
Watch Mercy's stream.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.720
I was wondering if you could do a Q&A too.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.720
I would absolutely love to.

48:11.720 --> 48:14.720
I would love to do a Q&A.

48:14.720 --> 48:16.720
Maybe we can read membership.

48:16.720 --> 48:17.720
Membership.

48:17.720 --> 48:18.720
Marshmallow.

48:18.720 --> 48:19.720
We can read marshmallow.

48:19.720 --> 48:20.720
Absolutely.

48:20.720 --> 48:21.720
Air Rocks.

48:21.720 --> 48:22.720
Starley.

48:22.720 --> 48:23.720
Air Rocks.

48:23.720 --> 48:24.720
Starley.

48:24.720 --> 48:25.720
Yes.

48:26.720 --> 48:30.720
We can 100% do a marshmallow reading.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.720
That would be fantastic.

48:32.720 --> 48:38.720
Although Mercy was purposely saying stuff wrong, which was quite funny.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.720
Really giving bad advice.

48:40.720 --> 48:41.720
Logan, have a lit.

48:41.720 --> 48:43.720
Thank you so much.

48:43.720 --> 48:47.720
If you hear my stomach, it's not because I'm hungry and starving.

48:47.720 --> 48:52.720
It's because I got a massive loaf of bread and I wouldn't come out before the stream.

48:52.720 --> 48:55.720
I went to the toilet three times and I never came out.

48:55.720 --> 48:57.720
So I'm sorry if you hear my stomach.

48:59.720 --> 49:02.720
This could be really funny for an April Fool's stream.

49:02.720 --> 49:05.720
Well, you win the grippers out again.

49:05.720 --> 49:07.720
What would the title of the stream be?

49:09.720 --> 49:13.720
Too many people ask real questions, but most of Mercy's advice was real, was it?

49:13.720 --> 49:14.720
Wait, hold on.

49:14.720 --> 49:16.720
Let me get my marshmallow.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.720
Because I was a movement.

49:18.720 --> 49:23.720
And then I'll go up along.

49:23.720 --> 49:25.720
I should only cut ones, yeah?

49:27.720 --> 49:28.720
What?

49:28.720 --> 49:31.720
You asked me anything.

49:31.720 --> 49:35.720
And before I can hardly say anything, that was,

49:35.720 --> 49:38.720
wait, where can I pin this?

49:39.720 --> 49:42.720
I would like to pin it, but the love heart is in the way.

49:42.720 --> 49:48.720
Someone at YouTube, you're telling me not one person at YouTube is aware of this issue?

49:48.720 --> 49:50.720
I refuse.

49:50.720 --> 49:52.720
Ten message.

49:55.720 --> 49:56.720
April Fool's.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.720
How is it April Fool's if I've already done it?

49:58.720 --> 49:59.720
I've already got you.

49:59.720 --> 50:01.720
The gag has been done.

50:01.720 --> 50:04.720
You can do my breath on me.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.720
Okay.

50:06.720 --> 50:09.720
That's my marshmallow thing.

50:09.720 --> 50:12.720
And what?

50:15.720 --> 50:18.720
No, Tier 2 is what's getting gifted, mummy.

50:18.720 --> 50:21.720
You have to raise a price for both ears.

50:21.720 --> 50:22.720
Wait, no.

50:22.720 --> 50:25.720
I only want emotes to be gifted.

50:25.720 --> 50:28.720
I wanted to leave emotes as $1.99.

50:28.720 --> 50:31.720
And I have to make it $5 for Tier 2?

50:32.720 --> 50:40.720
Honestly, the mental stress of raising it by $0.02 is really good to me.

50:40.720 --> 50:41.720
Okay.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.720
Be bad in gagging.

50:43.720 --> 50:45.720
Thank you for the membership.

50:45.720 --> 50:46.720
I appreciate it.

50:46.720 --> 50:47.720
We did warn you.

50:47.720 --> 50:50.720
I was just wanting them to work so badly.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.720
I don't want to raise the price.

50:54.720 --> 50:56.720
I have to, apparently if I want to raise the price,

50:56.720 --> 50:59.720
I need to close the tier and then open up a new one.

50:59.720 --> 51:01.720
I don't even know what happens.

51:01.720 --> 51:05.720
It only lets you donate the $4.99 tier.

51:07.720 --> 51:08.720
I'm so happy to have you back.

51:08.720 --> 51:09.720
I miss you.

51:09.720 --> 51:10.720
I miss you too.

51:10.720 --> 51:12.720
Oh, that's so annoying.

51:17.720 --> 51:21.720
I have to raise the price by a freaking dollar.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.720
So, by a dollar, by a cent.

51:23.720 --> 51:27.720
So, if I make it, you would leave emotes at $1.99.

51:27.720 --> 51:30.720
But Tier 2 has to go up to $5.99.

51:33.720 --> 51:35.720
Does it actually have to be?

51:37.720 --> 51:39.720
Say it right, sir.

51:39.720 --> 51:40.720
I will not go.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.720
Turn the lights off.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.720
Carry me home.

51:45.720 --> 51:46.720
Yeah.

51:46.720 --> 51:49.720
It has to go up to $5.99.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.720
It's just a dollar, do it.

51:52.720 --> 51:53.720
But you don't understand.

51:53.720 --> 51:55.720
You don't understand the principle

51:55.720 --> 51:57.720
about how much I can gloat and brag

51:57.720 --> 52:00.720
that it's only $9.99 to support your Oshi

52:00.720 --> 52:03.720
for a month, I feel, or you don't understand.

52:08.720 --> 52:09.720
Okay.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.720
But it's kind of more of the YouTube channel

52:12.720 --> 52:14.720
having to make problems, it's fine.

52:15.720 --> 52:18.720
So, right, I guess after this stream,

52:19.720 --> 52:22.720
for those of you who sign up now for the Tier 2,

52:22.720 --> 52:25.720
I think you only have to pay the $1 difference

52:25.720 --> 52:27.720
to get on the tier that is...

52:28.720 --> 52:29.720
Oh, that's so annoying.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.720
Can I make that new tier live, at least?

52:32.720 --> 52:33.720
Or is this like...

52:34.720 --> 52:36.720
I don't know how YouTube's going to take this.

52:38.720 --> 52:40.720
Oh, I don't know if YouTube's going to like me.

52:40.720 --> 52:41.720
Hold on.

52:45.720 --> 52:47.720
Levels, edit levels.

52:48.720 --> 52:49.720
No!

52:50.720 --> 52:53.720
It locked in, the price is locked in.

52:53.720 --> 52:56.720
I don't want to put up a dollar, but I have to.

52:59.720 --> 53:00.720
Oh, my God.

53:00.720 --> 53:01.720
Please, YouTube's not...

53:01.720 --> 53:04.720
Right, I have to basically add a new tier...

53:06.720 --> 53:07.720
For goodness' sake.

53:07.720 --> 53:11.720
Reefling member stream tier.

53:12.720 --> 53:13.720
Oh, and...

53:14.720 --> 53:15.720
For goodness' sake.

53:15.720 --> 53:17.720
You know tier...

53:18.720 --> 53:19.720
Oh, okay.

53:19.720 --> 53:21.720
Hold on, we're trying to do it together.

53:21.720 --> 53:24.720
Right, we need to do it in American Double Laws.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.720
United States, set a price...

53:27.720 --> 53:28.720
$5.99.

53:30.720 --> 53:31.720
$5.99.

53:32.720 --> 53:33.720
That's a book in it.

53:35.720 --> 53:37.720
Modes, give that man a backshot.

53:37.720 --> 53:38.720
What?

53:38.720 --> 53:39.720
Wait, what did that happen?

53:39.720 --> 53:42.720
We're doing it live, we're doing it live.

53:42.720 --> 53:43.720
We're doing it live, we are.

53:43.720 --> 53:44.720
Reefling...

53:45.720 --> 53:49.720
I'll just put it, Reefling member real tier.

53:49.720 --> 53:52.720
Because I'm out of things.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.720
And then add a peric...

53:56.720 --> 53:58.720
membership stream.

53:58.720 --> 54:00.720
Membership only live streams.

54:01.720 --> 54:03.720
This is the real deal.

54:03.720 --> 54:04.720
Y'all.

54:04.720 --> 54:06.720
And then peric instructions, nothing,

54:06.720 --> 54:08.720
because you guys don't need to do anything.

54:08.720 --> 54:10.720
Then next, what happens?

54:10.720 --> 54:13.720
I understand that once my offer's reviews improved,

54:13.720 --> 54:15.720
I'm unable to change, to introduce a new price,

54:15.720 --> 54:17.720
I can create a new level and or delete any existing.

54:17.720 --> 54:22.720
Deleting a level will cancel existing memberships if it happens.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.720
Okay, submit for review.

54:25.720 --> 54:31.720
Yes, my tier, my freaking membership streams do not have...

54:31.720 --> 54:34.720
Sorry, I'm like straight up talking when there's a thing.

54:36.720 --> 54:38.720
No, it does not come...

54:38.720 --> 54:42.720
Right, your peric is being sent for review, it said...

54:43.720 --> 54:45.720
$5.99!

54:47.720 --> 54:51.720
That's so expensive, I'm going to have to stream way more than...

54:51.720 --> 54:53.720
I'm going to have to stream more to earn that,

54:53.720 --> 54:56.720
because $5.99 is really getting expensive.

54:57.720 --> 55:00.720
Does it even display the damn thing?

55:00.720 --> 55:02.720
I don't think so.

55:05.720 --> 55:07.720
Right, it doesn't display it,

55:07.720 --> 55:10.720
because it's not been approved by YouTube, question mark.

55:12.720 --> 55:14.720
It's $1.

55:14.720 --> 55:17.720
So like, all the tier twos will be reset.

55:17.720 --> 55:21.720
So the tier twos can upgrade via $1.99.

55:21.720 --> 55:24.720
You already stream more than most, it's no problem.

55:24.720 --> 55:27.720
We can buy one less candy per month.

55:27.720 --> 55:29.720
You already stream every day.

55:29.720 --> 55:33.720
Yeah, well you're ready for multiple streams in one day of different things?

55:33.720 --> 55:34.720
Yeah.

55:34.720 --> 55:37.720
Am I losing my membership tier?

55:38.720 --> 55:39.720
Maybe.

55:42.720 --> 55:45.720
Why does it not work?

55:46.720 --> 55:48.720
Why does it not work?

55:50.720 --> 55:53.720
So what does it say? Is it there?

55:53.720 --> 55:55.720
No, it's not been approved, so you can't see it.

55:56.720 --> 55:59.720
Elliebot, thank you for the membership upgrade.

55:59.720 --> 56:01.720
Why does it specify you upgraded?

56:01.720 --> 56:03.720
That's so specific.

56:03.720 --> 56:05.720
Oh no, more streams, oh no.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.720
Thank you for fixing that.

56:07.720 --> 56:10.720
Yes, so we need to wait for YouTube to approve the new tier,

56:10.720 --> 56:13.720
and then that's the actual tier.

56:13.720 --> 56:17.720
I guess, but I don't know how long it takes to get it approved.

56:18.720 --> 56:22.720
I wonder, actually, I wonder if YouTube is going to be able to see

56:22.720 --> 56:24.720
that it's so similar to the second one,

56:24.720 --> 56:26.720
and they're going to be like, yeah, you're dumb.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.720
You praised it wrong, didn't you?

56:28.720 --> 56:30.720
And I'm like, yes, I praised it wrong, please forgive me.

56:30.720 --> 56:32.720
I'm sorry.

56:32.720 --> 56:35.720
And then YouTube will be like, I will have mercy on your soul.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.720
Your levels are approved, published.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.720
Wait, what? I already got approved?

56:40.720 --> 56:41.720
Wait.

56:42.720 --> 56:44.720
Hello, YouTube? Are you watching me right now?

56:44.720 --> 56:46.720
I promise I'm not doing anything bad.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.720
Feet are a natural part of the body.

56:49.720 --> 56:51.720
Thank you for monetizing me, YouTube.

56:51.720 --> 56:52.720
Please don't take it away.

56:52.720 --> 56:54.720
Is YouTube actually here right now?

56:54.720 --> 56:56.720
Why did it just get approved?

56:56.720 --> 56:58.720
Is it approved? Is it live?

56:58.720 --> 57:00.720
Wait, hold on, let me try it.

57:01.720 --> 57:03.720
Oh, okay. Wow, it is.

57:03.720 --> 57:04.720
Okay, right.

57:04.720 --> 57:07.720
I'm going to delete the other tier.

57:07.720 --> 57:09.720
Okay, thank you for upgrading.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.720
Did I delete it now?

57:11.720 --> 57:13.720
And then, oh my God, everyone's upgrading.

57:13.720 --> 57:14.720
Thank you so much.

57:14.720 --> 57:16.720
I'm so sorry, Mifflins.

57:16.720 --> 57:17.720
I'm so, so sorry.

57:17.720 --> 57:19.720
I've completely messed this.

57:19.720 --> 57:22.720
I've absolutely balled this one up.

57:22.720 --> 57:25.720
Right, I will delete the...

57:25.720 --> 57:26.720
How do I delete it?

57:26.720 --> 57:27.720
I do.

57:27.720 --> 57:28.720
I will delete it.

57:28.720 --> 57:29.720
Delete this level.

57:29.720 --> 57:32.720
If you delete a level, members of that level will lose their membership.

57:32.720 --> 57:34.720
Consider notifying them before deleting,

57:34.720 --> 57:36.720
encouraging them to change levels.

57:36.720 --> 57:40.720
Any member that purchases this level this month will be reimbursed.

57:40.720 --> 57:41.720
Okay, that's good.

57:41.720 --> 57:46.720
Any member that purchased this level this month will be reimbursed.

57:46.720 --> 57:50.720
Okay, YouTube, I'm reading that myself.

57:50.720 --> 57:53.720
Once you submit your changes, they'll get approved.

57:53.720 --> 57:54.720
Delete.

57:54.720 --> 57:59.720
Next, submit and review.

57:59.720 --> 58:02.720
I understand that once my offer is reviewed and approved,

58:02.720 --> 58:04.720
all members of deleted levels will lose their membership

58:04.720 --> 58:07.720
and will be reimbursed for the last month.

58:07.720 --> 58:09.720
Okay, submit for review.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.720
We're doing it live.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.720
Okay, we're doing it live.

58:13.720 --> 58:15.720
Do it live.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.720
Publish.

58:17.720 --> 58:19.720
Did that work?

58:19.720 --> 58:21.720
What does it say now?

58:21.720 --> 58:22.720
Wait, hold on, let me refresh.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.720
Hold on, I think we did it.

58:24.720 --> 58:25.720
Hold on, pause.

58:25.720 --> 58:27.720
I think we did it.

58:27.720 --> 58:28.720
We did it.

58:28.720 --> 58:31.720
Okay, I will not mess up with the girls,

58:31.720 --> 58:32.720
but I will...

58:32.720 --> 58:34.720
Okay, there we go.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.720
I believe it's fully working now.

58:36.720 --> 58:40.720
If you do gift memberships, it will only go to refling emotes,

58:40.720 --> 58:42.720
which I need to add a sugar ton to

58:42.720 --> 58:45.720
because it was like, you're only allowed to add four emotes

58:45.720 --> 58:47.720
until you get more members,

58:47.720 --> 58:51.720
so I'll add to the rest and I'll commission a ton more

58:51.720 --> 58:53.720
because with that amount of membership,

58:53.720 --> 58:57.720
I think there's quite more than 10 slots that I have.

58:57.720 --> 59:00.720
Thank you so much for your patience for me doing this.

59:00.720 --> 59:03.720
Thank you everyone who's upgrading to the new tier.

59:03.720 --> 59:10.720
I do apologize for the mistake.

59:10.720 --> 59:15.720
I really severely wanted membership gifting to be on emotes only

59:15.720 --> 59:20.720
because I didn't want to charge more than $5.99.

59:20.720 --> 59:23.720
No, $4.99.

59:23.720 --> 59:25.720
Thank you everyone who's upgrading.

59:25.720 --> 59:27.720
Can I see your upgrades?

59:27.720 --> 59:28.720
Nope.

59:28.720 --> 59:31.720
Stream Ellen's just really doesn't like it.

59:31.720 --> 59:34.720
That's very curious.

59:34.720 --> 59:37.720
Very curious indeed.

59:37.720 --> 59:40.720
But I won't mess up for the girls when I enable it.

59:40.720 --> 59:42.720
I don't know if and when.

59:42.720 --> 59:44.720
I don't know if she's doing hers right now.

59:44.720 --> 59:47.720
If she is, it's a surprise.

59:47.720 --> 59:52.720
I don't know if I'm the only one who's currently doing the membership member.

59:52.720 --> 59:54.720
Oh my god, I don't think.

59:54.720 --> 59:57.720
Wait, it's not telling me the upgrades?

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.720
No.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.720
It's not telling me when you've upgraded.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.720
Like on my screen, on any screen.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.720
I'm so sorry.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.720
I don't think I can keep up with the upgrades.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.720
Thank you everyone who's upgrading.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.720
I appreciate it.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.720
I'm so sorry.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720
I suck.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.720
I suck as a streamer.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.720
My apologies for such an unprofessional start.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.720
But then again, is it really me if it's not unprofessional?

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.720
It's so over.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.720
No.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.720
We will support the cut for this regard.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.720
Thank you.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.720
I think it's not an upgrade now because the tier is gone.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.720
So it's just a new membership.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.720
It's not registered.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.720
Oh wait, is it registered?

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.720
Oh no.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.720
This can't be.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.720
Wait, how am I supposed to...

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.720
Oh wow, so it's not even telling me if it's an upgrade now.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.720
Okay, this is good.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.720
Membership note showing in your stream elements is a bug with your stream elements account.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.720
I've contacted their support about it.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:04.720
I wonder if the stream elements is for Twitch really.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:09.720
But thank you so much everyone for upgrading or becoming a member of the tier.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.720
I actually can't remember if I've said it wrong.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.720
We can just send it.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.720
You're more professional than many streamers.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.720
You treat us like humans.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.720
Who streams and doesn't treat you like a human?

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720
What?

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.720
Please tell me there's not actually streamers like that.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.720
I remember when you guys taught me that people get actually jealous.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:35.720
Like if they see you in someone else's chat and I'm like, huh?

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.720
That's real?

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.720
Because I thought you guys were memeing on me, like teaching me this.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:47.720
And I'm like, wait, some VTubers expect you to solely watch them and only them.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.720
It was very eye-opening.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.720
Very eye-opening.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.720
Boy, thank you for the tip.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720
Alert this.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.720
For some reason, I can see that on stream elements, but nothing else.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.720
I can see if someone gifts membership on stream elements as well.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720
But that's it.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.720
This bit was off.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.720
Some people are a bit cray-cray about it.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.720
I used to be sweating right now.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.720
That was slightly different.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.720
I understand where she said that.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.720
Yeah, it's a lot more common than you think.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.720
I'm only going to have time for you to try.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.720
It's a lot more than 12 hours streams, yeah.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.720
Oh, thank you for the gifted membership.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.720
iPor, thank you.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.720
Oh, you need to allow gifts.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.720
There may be a prompt in chat right now to allow gifts.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.720
Make sure you click it.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.720
Thank you.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.720
It will say that you can receive gifts.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.720
I don't know how it works.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.720
My membership just got refunded.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720
Did I miss something?

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:58.720
Yes, I had to change the price because gifted membership was the wrong price.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.720
So thank you, everyone, who's resubbing.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.720
I believe you got a refund question mark question mark, which is really good.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:16.720
It's so sweet.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.720
Yeah, we all got refunded.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720
That was really quick.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.720
Honestly, shout out to YouTube if everyone literally got refunded.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.720
That was so quick.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.720
Where is the join button on mobile?

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720
Get right, you're on mobile.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.720
There is no join button.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.720
It's just a mystery.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:35.720
The join button is more of a suggestion than actual rules.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.720
Thank you, everyone, for resubbing.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.720
I'm so sorry.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.720
T.W., thank you for resubbing.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:49.720
Giving Kitsuny, Consulus, Lolliwika, Conrad, Asterix.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.720
I'm like pretty sure I've said all these names before.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.720
I'm so sorry to anyone whose name I haven't said before.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.720
The join button is on the YouTube page.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:06.720
Oh, if you want my YouTube page, apparently.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.720
Cookie Fumplur.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.720
You guys have such funny gamer tags, honestly.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.720
Sorry, I meant 21 Bibboots over 21 days.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.720
Not all at once.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.720
I was in a rush to get a brain rot.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.720
I was about to clarify.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.720
Okay, I was going to say that was quite the length.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.720
Being inspired by the 21 days of brushing me.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.720
The microplastics will be purged.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.720
Oh, that's a good, I like that.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.720
I subscribed on desktop with PayPal on the old 4.99.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.720
So what now?

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.720
YouTube should have already refunded you apparently.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:40.720
Apparently everyone already got refunded like within seconds.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:47.720
So the new tier is $1 more due to the fact that Gifted Membership will go to Emote Tier,

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.720
which was what I wanted.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.720
But I was so stubborn and like, oh yeah, YouTube.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:59.720
I'm sure YouTube will make sure that you can't donate streams at that price.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.720
But no, no.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.720
YouTube insisted.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.720
YouTube insisted.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.720
PayPal learned me what's pending.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.720
It should.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.720
VTuber Foot Connoisseur, thank you.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.720
What a name.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.720
What a name to show up in this stream with.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.720
What a name.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.720
Thank you for becoming a member.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720
That's hilarious.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720
Mika's biggest fan.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.720
I'm thinking Mika, Mika, Uwe.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.720
Art Bomb Biscuit, thank you.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.720
What a name.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.720
Honestly, you like the French tip?

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.720
Is this dinner for you?

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.720
That's right.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:43.720
Where other VTubers don't provide, I come sweeping in on week one.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.720
Week one, I give you what you seek.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.720
He really is a connoisseur.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.720
How's the winded tour doing?

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.720
I had to take painkillers because it's getting a bit sore.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:00.720
I may or may not be making a doctor's appointment about my toe.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.720
Because something...

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.720
I'm going to see what happens.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:08.720
I'm going to go for a bath after the stream and let it sweat it out, like in the hot water.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:15.720
In Vulcan, Black Blood, Zafarian, Jacob of Thru.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.720
I still forgot this is week one.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.720
I mean technical, well, we're just entered week two, I guess.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:26.720
But if YouTube stats updated immediately, we would have been monetized day one.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.720
But it took a whole week for it to thingy.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.720
This is week two, my apology.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.720
Fee.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.720
Yes.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.720
Fee.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.720
I'm so sorry if you don't like immersion breaking.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.720
Although I am literally as white as night.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.720
I'm actually, I'm so white, I'm transparent.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.720
What the heck did I just move there?

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.720
You can literally see my veins in the blue.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.720
You didn't know veins are blue.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.720
They carry deoxygenated blood back to your heart.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:55.720
They also have back blow valves, which are really good.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.720
It stops the blood from going backwards in your system.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.720
Because if your blood ever goes backwards, that's very, very, very bad.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.720
Yeah, you're probably not going to make it if your blood starts going backwards.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.720
Strunnies, paralysis and everything.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.720
Yes.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.720
And then your arteries are what the little red veins are.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.720
All the redness.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.720
That's pushing oxygenated blood to where it's needed.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.720
And then your circulatory system takes care of the rest.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.720
It's really quite fascinating.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.720
You could also talk about the heart.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.720
If you like.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.720
Today, thank you for signing up.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.720
Oh, you've got a banding of Isaac.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.720
This, what's that, X?

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.720
The fucking laser one.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.720
That's a...

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.720
Sass and frizz.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.720
That's swine up.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.720
You guys really Pokemon and video game pictures.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.720
That's quite cool.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.720
Thank you for signing up.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720
Your feet are beautiful.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.720
Don't worry.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.720
Theans, yeah.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.720
You like seeing the deoxygenated blood pumping through these veins?

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.720
I can't wait for you to play Binding of Isaac.

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:06.720
November, I'm just warning you all right now.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.720
November is when Binding of Isaac's 10-year anniversary is

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.720
and Molly Player is unlocked.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.720
I am not going to be off that from...

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.720
You can see my hands in the shadow.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.720
I am instructing you.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:27.720
I am not going to be off that game for a very long time.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.720
Okay?

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:29.720
Do you understand?

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.720
Refling.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.720
And then you all say I understand.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.720
Mame in unison.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.720
Okay?

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.720
We're going to be playing multiplayer Isaac all day long.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:39.720
Multiple days.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.720
Am I even...

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:48.720
Am I even commit to a week and alienate more people with my Binding of Isaac?

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.720
Just so you understand.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.720
But thank you all for signing off.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720
I understand.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.720
I understand, Mame.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720
I understand, Mame.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.720
I understand.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.720
Yes.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.720
Good reflings.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.720
Good reflings.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.720
You will be rewarded for your...

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.720
Sorry, I didn't realize how much my shadow was casting over.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.720
You will be rewarded.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.720
Wait, if you can see my shadow...

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.720
No, we'll do that in a membership.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.720
That was a very bad idea.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.720
That was a terrible idea.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.720
I don't want any of your little ears cleaned.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.720
Let me pick up this Q-tip or this ear cleaner.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.720
Let me just pick up this ear cleaner.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.720
I understand.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.720
Right, over here you go.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.720
Just need to hold it like a bit.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.720
Oh, I dropped it.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.720
It's not very good.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.720
It's actually quite hard to utilize this.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.720
Put it...

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.720
There we go.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.720
Right, you ready for some ear cleaning?

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:41.720
Oh, poor you.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.720
See, if you get trapped water in your ear, don't worry too much.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.720
Your ear can expel it at a later time.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:53.720
Some people actually find that expelling of the water in your ear quite...

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.720
Oh wait, you can't even see me touch the thing.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.720
This is...

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:01.720
Right, I'm going to do a basic 101.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.720
Sorry, I'm a whisper.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.720
I need a whisper.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.720
I'm getting too passionate.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.720
I'm going to show you a basic 101 for any ASMR artist that's watching right now.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.720
Okay?

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.720
And I know this is very hypocritical because I've just bashed the ear about...

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.720
I'm going to teach you this right now live.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.720
Okay?

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.720
You see this ear?

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.720
Inside this ear?

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.720
This black section?

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.720
This is what you don't do, okay?

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.720
This is what you don't do.

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.720
No ASMRs.

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.720
You go around the microphone.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.720
Around gently, okay?

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.720
Don't ever touch this bit here.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.720
That's the microphone, okay?

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.720
But go around the ear.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.720
Gentle strokes.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.720
Gentle, gentle, gentle, gentle, okay?

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.720
Gentle strokes.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.720
That's all you need.

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.720
Just gentle movements.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.720
Gentle, gentle.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:22.720
Okay?

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.720
There, 101 ASMR.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.720
That's all you need to know.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.720
This, I'm going to try and avoid doing with the toe.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Just around the ear.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720
You don't need to go inside.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.720
No, no, no, no.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.720
I know.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.720
I know you guys like to rush into it, okay?

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.720
Why are you covered in band-aids?

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.720
I caught myself making food.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.720
I hurt myself on my fingy.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.720
So I have to put a band-aid on.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.720
I'm a bit of, which is known as a clutch.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.720
Thank you.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.720
I had nothing.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.720
I drank my karma.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.720
The ceremony, or Bubba the Great.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.720
I appreciate it.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.720
Wait.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.720
Does that mean you were making food with your foot?

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.720
No, this, I got all my toes done at the same time.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.720
But this part, so when you get your toes done,

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.720
they take clippers and they take this like push thing.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.720
They like pushed all my, like, toe skin back and stuff.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.720
But this section on this toe, she has cut,

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.720
I was actually kind of sore touching that.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.720
I'm not even going to lie,

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.720
she cut and sliced into it as she was cutting my toenail.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.720
And it's quite sore and I'm not really sure what to do.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.720
I've not really experienced such a problem before,

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:55.720
but we will, we'll be fine.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.720
I think we'll be okay.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.720
Thank you, Star Killer, for becoming a member.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.720
Do you guys want me to flip you instead?

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.720
Wait a minute, I got a freaking tiny...

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:20.720
Seems like you forgot her pronounce my name from yesterday.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.720
Spain-ee, lol.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.720
Spain-ee, that's what I said.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.720
Anyway, I'm off to work, see you later and congrats on monetization.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.720
Thank you for the tip and yes, thank you.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.720
Spain-ee, you could literally hear me like be scared to say it

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.720
because I say it wrong all the time.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.720
Starny, do you have a stethoscope?

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.720
No, I don't.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.720
That would be quite the prop for ASMR, honestly,

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.720
having a stethoscope.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.720
You push back the cuticle, the nail bit cleaner,

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.720
but the actual tool lining is not a cuticle.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.720
You should probably get it right, Muckers.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.720
This is great, but I have class now.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720
Okay, enjoy class.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.720
Get educated, get educated, get educated, get through will.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.720
Epsom salt foot bath, yeah.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.720
I think I'd make just something like that,

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.720
because it's a wee bit sore.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.720
I heard someone say use it for heartbeat ASMR.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.720
Oh, would that even work?

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720
I don't know, we tried.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.720
I wouldn't mind buying that prop.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.720
I will buy that prop with my membership money.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.720
Thank you, wonderful members.

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.720
I hope we're full of heels, yeah.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:28.720
I think we'll be fine, right?

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.720
Sorry, let me look at the Q and A questions on marshmallow.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.720
Congrats on the membership.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.720
You're the goodest girl around.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.720
What is your favourite meal to eat?

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:41.720
Savery, something savory.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.720
Hello, will Patreon subs get to see the membership streams on Patreon?

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.720
Nope, they are two different subscriptions.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:52.720
Patreon and YouTube activity are two separate things.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.720
So, if you're interested in seeing your girl,

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.720
your Oshidevs live, then that is more YouTube orientated.

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.720
If you're interested in the alternative content

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.720
that any member of Veiler offers, that is what is on Patreon.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.720
Thank you for your question.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.720
You have big feet for a woman.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.720
Okay, wow.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.720
I don't know what you want me to do with that.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.720
You may sign up for basketball.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.720
Right, sorry, let me just end the stream.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.720
I'm going to contact NBA.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.720
Big feet?

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.720
You think I have big feet?

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.720
Are you sure it's not perspective,

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.720
because you have nothing else to judge?

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.720
Literally, what?

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.720
Big feet is good.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:34.720
Your feet are great.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.720
Literally, everyone's been saying my feet are cute and stuff,

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.720
and then you come to me and you're like, yeah, your feet are massive.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.720
I'm sorry, do you want me to bind them?

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.720
Like, we're in fucking China or something?

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.720
Like, back when they used to bind the lowest feet?

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.720
Is that what you want?

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.720
You want a little fucking lowest feet?

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.720
Get out of here with that shit.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.720
I don't know anything about feet, but they're normal feet.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.720
Yeah, I'm just like...

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.720
Like, oh, sorry, excuse me.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.720
Oh, I see.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.720
When I spawned in, when I spawned in,

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.720
I actually picked the foot size manually.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.720
You know, there's a little slider bar and everything.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.720
Banana for scale.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.720
I don't even have bananas.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.720
Oh, do you want my stoop waffle that I ate yesterday for scale?

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.720
There, there's your scale.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.720
Your stoop waffle.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.720
Your fear.

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:18.720
Thank you.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.720
No sense of permanence.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:25.720
I'm just going to assume you're a talking pair of feet, honestly.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.720
Who said that?

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.720
Who?

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.720
I don't know.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.720
What feet size are you?

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.720
I actually don't know.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:34.720
I've not bought...

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.720
I bought...

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.720
When did I buy a new pair of shoes?

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.720
I completely forgot.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.720
I had to get measured for them actually when I got a new pair of shoes

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:47.720
because I didn't know what my shoe size was.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.720
I don't know what to say here, to be honest,

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.720
but I'm glad for Shibi Dome Momaya.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.720
She's really cute and the gap was really nice.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.720
Sorry, Stroney.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.720
And the year-long wait was worth it.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.720
Aw, I'm glad to think so.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.720
Yeah.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.720
Some people were asking, like,

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.720
weren't you worried about, like,

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.720
everyone being disappointed after a year's wait?

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.720
And I'm like, I'm sorry,

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.720
but if you're, if you're a wifelin',

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.720
you knew what, you knew we were mean men.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.720
You knew I was rambling.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.720
You knew exactly what was going on.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.720
Merci.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.720
When are you doing your membership stream

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.720
for no particular reason?

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.720
Star Killer, thank you.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.720
Nayudi Julie, thank you.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.720
Swirly Lexa 6.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.720
You have...

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720
Thank you for signing up.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.720
Your profile picture around me,

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.720
I could have bought a frickin' hypno thing

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.720
and put it on the floor and hypnotise people to my feet.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.720
My feet?

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.720
They're gonna be so funny though.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.720
I can't put it off.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.720
Jesus.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720
Fuckin'...

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.720
Okay, that's a bit too hard.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.720
We're squishing the ball.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.720
We're going back to squishing the ball.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.720
It's so easy to squish a ball.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.720
Feet cam...

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:10.720
Feet stream Q&A.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.720
Will you ever beat the Peeler Alligator?

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.720
I don't think so.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:22.720
So when the girls started posting it for free,

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.720
I was like,

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.720
oh, I was gonna do a donut-on-reward

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.720
where I wrap my 3D weapon like a poly bag,

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.720
like a plastic bag,

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.720
hypnotising the reefing through your feet

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.720
to convince them I worshipped the feet, honestly.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.720
Goes in a straw knee stream.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.720
Your feet are big, good for gathering produce all day.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.720
So, literally, I was like,

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.720
I've never seen you in my life.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.720
And now you want to do it for free?

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.720
Yeah.

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.720
I was gonna make it a fun donut-on-reward

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.720
because I was gonna do it on 3D all night.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.720
But I need to wrap it up to make sure it doesn't,

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.720
you know, short circuit.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.720
What is this about being in a bag?

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.720
Might need that stream.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.720
Hey.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.720
Oh, reefing.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.720
Oh, what a pee.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.720
Peas on you.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.720
You still can.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.720
Wow.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.720
3D MoMA?

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.720
That's terrible, honestly.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.720
Oh, my, like, donut-on-plans are absolutely outrageous.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.720
Someone says,

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.720
hi, love you.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.720
That's all.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.720
Love you, reefing.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.720
Someone says, Pokemon or Digimon?

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.720
I only saw Pokemon.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.720
I never got into Digimon.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.720
Because wasn't the Digimon meme

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.720
that's literally, like,

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.720
this, like, cute adorable thing

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:48.720
ends up developing, like, an AK-47.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.720
And, like, a galeel on one arm,

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.720
a Famous on the other.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.720
The only big thing Strenny has

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.720
is her...

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.720
her...

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.720
her heart.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.720
She has a really big heart.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.720
Hearing your feet sweat

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.720
stick to the ball

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.720
reminds me of ear coughing

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.720
when the hand leaves the ear.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.720
Oh, stop.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.720
Wait, I think my feet are sweating

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.720
off to do your Pokemon vlog.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.720
What does this sound like?

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.720
Oh, that's great.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.720
Oh, you actually like it?

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.720
Thank you, Destiny, to enjoy your cave.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.720
It sounds nice.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.720
Pokemon vlog.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:43.720
Can I do two at...

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:44.720
Can I do both?

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720
Hold on.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.720
I think I can do the Joe-Wheeled ear cupping.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.720
Oh, sorry, I just peaked the audio.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.720
It's a bit more difficult this way.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.720
It sounds good.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.720
Wait, there really are sticking to the ear.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.720
Did you miss the Pop Rock segment

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.720
where I proved how sweaty my feet are

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.720
via Pop Rocking?

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.720
I just realized the mic is swapped.

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:12.720
Is it?

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:13.720
Oh, no.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.720
Is it on the wrong side?

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.720
I can swap it out manually if you want.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.720
Peaking the audio just means you're peeking.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.720
You want to hear my heartbeat from my foot?

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.720
I don't know if I can do that.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.720
I don't think you can hear it.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720
I go here 10 minutes ago.

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.720
Yeah, the start of the stream.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.720
I may or may not have opened up Pop Rocks

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.720
and put them on the soles of my feet

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.720
to prove how sweaty my feet are.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.720
And they popped.

01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.720
No outside influence necessary.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:03.720
So I have proven that I do have hyperhydrolysis.

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.720
Not that anyone needed proof.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.720
I don't know why you would make up such an accusation

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.720
in all honesty.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.720
Why would anyone want it?

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.720
Thank you, glacial soles.

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.720
Yeah.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.720
Oh, tapping ASMR.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.720
So fancy.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.720
I get sweaty feet too, yeah.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.720
Just as a mild warning to anyone who's listening,

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.720
if you have permanent sweaty hands and feet,

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.720
please do consider autism.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.720
That's all, that's my note.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.720
Can we do toe tapping ASMR?

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720
Oh, yes.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.720
Yes, it's actually a very common satrate

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.720
of having autism

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.720
by having permanently sweaty hands and feet.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.720
What if you have hairy palms?

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.720
I don't actually know.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.720
Maybe you're Italian, because aren't Italians hairy?

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.720
I am acoustic.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.720
Oh, that explains a lot actually.

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:21.720
Yeah.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.720
We have strong autism though.

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.720
Little toe tapping ASMR, that's right.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.720
That's right.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.720
Average VTuber will recharge thousands for this

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:33.720
in a donor phone.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.720
Me, you get it for free.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.720
I never noticed it until you actually mentioned it,

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.720
but yeah, I do have autism and sweaty hands and feet.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.720
Yeah, it's a very common trait.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.720
If you are...

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:50.720
Depending on the scale, however you want to scale,

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.720
you can do it different ways,

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.720
but if you are on the high need side of autism,

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:58.720
if you do toe walking only,

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.720
that is a massive indicator, a humongous indicator

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.720
that you are kind of on the upper scale

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.720
of the present needs.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.720
Thank you, Jin Azuru channel.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.720
And thank you, Krax.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:14.720
Krax.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.720
I used to have...

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:21.720
I have to use antiperspirant on my feet anytime I had,

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.720
otherwise it's blistering.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.720
Huh, I never noticed that before,

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:26.720
but you're right about the sweaty feet.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.720
Yeah.

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.720
The toe walking is too real.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.720
Toe walking is a humongous indicator

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:37.720
that the child, that normally it's noticed in childhood,

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.720
you can unlearn it as you get older,

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.720
but it's a massive indicator.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.720
I used to toe walk all the time.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.720
Yes, it is one of the biggest giveaways

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.720
of a child's autistic,

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.720
basically, if they toe walk.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.720
Got used to some powers for goods.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.720
Literally, well, like, without mine,

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.720
like, I had...

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:05.720
I stopped at VTubers, I've been stroking my ego.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.720
They're like, I don't know how you do it.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.720
I don't know how you stream.

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.720
I'm like, do I tell them the truth

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.720
and the reason I can stream all the time

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.720
is because I have to?

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.720
Or am I just like, oh, I'm just really passionate.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.720
I just really like what I get to do.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.720
For me, it's always sitting in weird ways

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.720
that put so much pressure on my feet

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.720
that I keep getting callused feet.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:31.720
I toe run, is that similar?

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.720
Toe running, maybe isn't the biggest indicator

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.720
in children, but then like,

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.720
you can start getting stimulated.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.720
She's unstoppable.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.720
I walked on toes as a child

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.720
and then my feet are...

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.720
Don't be shy, you can finish the rest of your sentence.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.720
We don't bite here.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.720
We don't bite from around these folks.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.720
I got...

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.720
Do you remember that South Park episode about us?

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.720
This is enough toe tapping.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.720
What else can I do?

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:03.720
I freaking...

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.720
I've brought this stick in.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.720
Some people, like, wouldn't stick ASMR.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.720
I've never particularly found it easy to record it.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.720
So the only thing I can do really is just tapping,

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.720
like, on the ear.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.720
Any other major indications of tism?

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.720
There's time.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.720
I don't know.

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.720
Any other major indications of tism?

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.720
There's tons, like,

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.720
stimming with hands, lack of eye contact is a big one.

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.720
My biggest question to you,

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.720
if you're sitting here and you're like,

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:41.720
hold on a minute, she's starting to...

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.720
she's spitting the truth.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:45.720
My biggest question, if you genuinely are like,

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.720
huh, is how different would the world look

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.720
if everyone thought like you?

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:52.720
How different would the world look

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:53.720
if everyone thought like you?

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.720
And before you're like,

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:55.720
that's not an indication,

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.720
just think about it a bit more.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:00.720
Okay, just think a little bit deeper into that question.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.720
Okay?

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.720
Anyway, gifts are messed up.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.720
Everyone's getting tier two, one dollar

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.720
for something we really wanted, so why?

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.720
One more dollar for something we really wanted, so why?

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.720
Wait, was that because...

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:27.720
Oh wait, is this an old...

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.720
Sorry, this might be an old message.

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.720
Hold on.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.720
Sorry, I'm reading...

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.720
I'm so happy to have you back.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.720
I miss you so much.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.720
I miss you too a lot recently.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:40.720
Okay, yeah, sorry.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.720
Those were old ones talking about the tier.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.720
Thank you for anyone's info about the tiers.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.720
World ends up addicted to watching VLM.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.720
That's how we take over.

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.720
You guys thought my hypnosis was to drown you all?

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.720
No, it was to...

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:58.720
I don't know.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.720
Oh my god, my feet are sometimes so dirty.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.720
I'm gonna put your mops on to protect you

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.720
because I'm probably gonna mess up shortly.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.720
I can get a bit of a mint.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:16.720
Right, let's see where we are.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:20.720
What?

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.720
You're the strongest, at least mentally,

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.720
I don't know about physically,

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.720
like me who struggled to open a can of fizzy juice

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.720
on the hand-cam stream.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.720
Eep.

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.720
Can I buy or use Band-Aids to put on an alt-art?

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.720
This one literally has gunk on it.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.720
I don't know what's going on with this toe,

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.720
but we'll figure it out.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.720
Girl I've ever known.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.720
But someone like you should never mess with infections,

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.720
get that toe-checked ace up.

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:50.720
Oh, Monka Ace, okay.

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.720
If you had to take painkillers, you can go to the ER,

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.720
but I know you'll never do it because you're a sweetheart,

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.720
but somebody else could sue that pedicure.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.720
Oh no, she didn't mean it.

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.720
You should at least show them the medical papers

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:04.720
you get from the hospital.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.720
Monka Ace, am I going to the hospital because of my toe?

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:12.720
I'll tell you what, I'll update you some Twitter after my bath.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.720
I'll do a salt plingy and see what happens,

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.720
because salt normally makes up.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:23.720
Would you be interested in playing Omega Strikers on stream?

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:28.720
It's a 3v3 mob-style air hockey that's free to play.

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:30.720
Oh my god, that sounds fun.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.720
Omega Strikers.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:40.720
Thank you, whoa, and thank you, Panopetition.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.720
Oh my god, Omega Strikers looks so cool.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.720
All their waifus are cute.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.720
Isn't this free to play?

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.720
Oh no, it's Nintendo.

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:57.720
Oh no.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.720
It's Nintendo.

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.720
Nintendo's so expensive.

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:05.720
Is it Nintendo?

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.720
Oh yeah.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:13.720
Oh no, this can't be.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:15.720
This can't be, it can't be Nintendo.

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.720
Why does it say Nintendo on the top now?

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.720
It's on PC.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:21.720
Oh okay, it's on PC.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.720
Right, whoa, okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.720
If it's on PC, it can't be overcharged that much.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.720
If anything is specifically published by Nintendo,

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.720
just know you're going to get rinsed out ours for the price.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.720
It's absolutely ridiculous.

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:36.720
Wait, I can see that.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.720
It showed up.

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.720
Panoptition.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.720
Panoption, thank you so much for, oh my goodness,

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.720
all those gifted memberships.

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.720
Whoa, wait a minute.

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:51.720
Stream Elements is assigning your gifts in real time.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.720
I can see who's been gifted your gifts.

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.720
Thank you so much.

01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.720
Congrats to everyone who managed to catch that.

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.720
You do have to enable it in chat.

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.720
I'm so sorry, I can hardly say the name.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.720
Panoptition, surely it's Panoptition.

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.720
Panoptition, thank you so much for the 20 gifted, thank you.

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:12.720
And congrats to everyone who caught up with their face.

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.720
It's all coming together.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.720
Yes, you'll have to like, I think you have to talk in chat

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.720
or even if you just say a simple message like hi

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.720
and then it'll be like you could have got this, enable it.

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:31.720
I love you.

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.720
Will you go on a date with me?

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.720
You better come to the convention.

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:37.720
I'm giving everyone roses.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.720
I think if we ever did like an actual convention,

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.720
I'd love to buy like single roses so I can give it out

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:45.720
and I'll be like, ha, that's right.

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:49.720
You have beat all the odds of a man never receiving a flower

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.720
before he is.

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.720
Hold on, let me hydrate, let me hydrate.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:04.720
Well, convention where?

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.720
No, there's been no picked convention,

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.720
but I really want to try it once in my life.

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.720
I've never been to a convention before.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:15.720
I've never been to like a location that has been

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:20.720
self-identified for nerds and dorks like us.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:24.720
So it would be a very unique experience.

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:29.720
Wow, that is like literally real-time assigning gifted

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.720
memberships.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.720
That's crazy.

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.720
That's so cool.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.720
Viola Conta.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:41.720
Well, the only thing is I have absolutely crippling,

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.720
traveling anxiety, which is a bit of a problem.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:48.720
There's a big convention in California, I think,

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.720
and a lot of the girls would actually be able to make it

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.720
manually, I think, if we all went.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:58.720
But I don't want to let the team down.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.720
There's a lot of issues about getting on a plane.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:07.720
And I get violently motion sick as well.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:11.720
This is why I just want to farm with a U-reflink,

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.720
because I can't travel anywhere.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:19.720
I get so sick, like I had to get a taxi.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.720
I get a taxi to my dentist appointment.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.720
And it's not even that far away from me.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.720
I was violently ill.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.720
I was like, ooh.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.720
I was like, can I just put the window down?

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.720
And the guy's like, yeah, yeah.

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.720
He's like on his phone talking to his pal and all that.

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.720
I'm getting scared.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.720
Oh.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:42.720
I would use thank you, Nero, for becoming a member.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:43.720
I can see that.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.720
Get drunk and pass out on the plane, honestly.

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.720
I would be so high on medication.

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:52.720
See, the problem is I don't want to be like,

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.720
I'm definitely going to a convention,

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.720
because I have A-bomb.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.720
And A-bomb really messes up things that happen in real life.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.720
And I don't want to be like, oh, you should go to this convention

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.720
in Melbourne on this day at this time.

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:08.720
I'll be here, because I don't want anyone to spend money

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:12.720
to come out on the sole reason to come see me type thing.

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:16.720
Because if my freaking A-bomb gets in the way,

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.720
I, oh wait, I'll tell it in another stream, okay?

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.720
But I have a really freaking, it's really frustrating,

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.720
but it's quite humorous at the same time.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:28.720
But yeah, you could be the one of those robots that meet up.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:29.720
Yeah, that's possible.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.720
First Mercy next round.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.720
Do all the girls have motion sickness?

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:34.720
Oh no, I can still play video games.

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:38.720
I have like travel motion sickness.

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:39.720
Like a parent.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:40.720
Oh wait, no.

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.720
She put those goofy goggles on her eyes.

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.720
I'm pretty sure she did.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.720
No, you're right about Mercy.

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:50.720
She put those funny goggles on her eyes.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.720
What is A-bomb?

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.720
A-bomb stands for anxiety,

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.720
because people are sick of hearing about it,

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.720
like the word anxiety.

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.720
So I just call it A-bomb as a substitute.

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.720
It's ear problems?

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.720
Oh, well I can fix your ear problems with my sweaty feet.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:10.720
Oh yes, oh yes, you can hear that.

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.720
There's a little tool rubbing ASMR.

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:18.720
Yeah, that's right, a little rubber.

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.720
Maybe you don't see that on airport.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:26.720
Oh no, yeah, we're not going to use that terminology.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.720
I think Johnny can fix their ear problems on his Patreon.

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.720
I mean your motion sickness, sorry.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.720
Do you take game suggestions?

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.720
I do, I have absolutely no issues.

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.720
A lot of streamers kind of don't...

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:47.720
No, that's not nice.

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:48.720
I will not generalise.

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.720
Please don't be afraid to...

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.720
Dap your bucket, thank you for becoming a member.

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:56.720
Please don't be afraid to, you know, ask me questions,

01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.720
or game suggestions are perfectly fine with me,

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:04.720
I have no problems.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.720
Is that how many people use A-bomb as a word

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:08.720
for being mildly introverted?

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:16.720
Yes, I kind of generally touch up on the subject

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.720
just because I am very thankful to be where I am

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:21.720
versus where I was,

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.720
but I feel like people are so tired

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:25.720
and burned out hearing about it and like,

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.720
oh everyone's got it.

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.720
And I'm like, yeah, I wonder everyone's got it.

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:31.720
Have you seen society today?

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.720
We live in a society, I wonder everyone's got it.

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:35.720
Anyway, we can do that.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.720
I can talk about that in another stream.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.720
This stream is supposed to be me celebrating monetisation

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:42.720
and yet again I'm talking about

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.720
how we need the downfall of society.

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.720
It's terrible.

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.720
It's shocking.

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:48.720
I've got his DEMPA in here,

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.720
no way DEMPA is in here staring at my toes right now.

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.720
Oh, gorgeous.

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:57.720
Hi DEMPA, I have no idea what size my feet are.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:00.720
I bought like new shoes last year

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.720
and they had to measure them

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:05.720
and I already forgot my shoes aren't in this room.

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:08.720
Sorry DEMPA, I had to be this way.

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:11.720
I literally am, I had to be this way.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.720
Yeah DEMPA, you should do foot cam ASMR with me.

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.720
You want to come over?

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.720
I feel like you would have smaller toes than me.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.720
I've never had a pedicure before.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.720
Oh, well if you ever get one,

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.720
just make sure they don't mess up your toe by the way

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.720
because mine's an agony.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.720
You definitely need to be careful with that.

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:37.720
Here's my beefling heart.

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:41.720
The world is, there's no surprise.

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.720
I have a broken pinky toe,

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.720
can you like spread your little,

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.720
look at my pinky toe, it's a little dance.

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.720
I don't want someone to touch my feet.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:00.720
Getting a massage is very unique sensation.

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.720
Very, very unique sensation.

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.720
DEMPA, I've got a strange feeling somewhere.

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.720
Poor DEMPA's pinky toe.

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:13.720
Are there any game genres you want to avoid?

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.720
I don't like, oh this is going to be controversial.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.720
I might filter some people with this one.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:23.720
The reason, I do not like games like Resident Evil

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.720
where you give me ammunition,

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:27.720
but it does not perish the enemy.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.720
Do not give me enemies that cannot be perished.

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.720
What is the point in having an ammunition resource management section

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.720
if it does not perish the big bad enemy?

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.720
Please do not suggest these kinds of games.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.720
It will turn into a rage stream real quick

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.720
and I will become so scots you will not actually be able to understand them.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:50.720
I'm sorry, but do not give me ammunition if it does not perish then.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:51.720
Simple as.

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.720
I mean, that's fair.

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:54.720
Preach.

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.720
Did you put hydrogen peroxide on it?

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.720
No, I'm going to take a bath.

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:01.720
I'm going to take this off and go for a bath

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.720
and do salt in the bath.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:09.720
You mean like that 30 bullets to kill that one enemy?

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.720
Yeah.

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.720
I'm sure the Resident Evil games are good.

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.720
However, I have fantastic news.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.720
I have five gen mates that are more than likely to play that kind of genre.

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.720
I've never played Resident Evil.

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.720
I watched my dad play Resident Evil

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.720
and it started off in Africa,

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.720
but he couldn't even get through it

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.720
and we were both watching it and we were like,

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.720
well, I was watching him play it

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.720
and both of us were looking at each other like,

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:38.720
what is this?

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.720
He couldn't get through it.

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.720
I couldn't get through it.

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.720
Oh, Res Fat.

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.720
Yeah, it was like set in Africa or something.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.720
It was like super hot Savannah type thing.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:53.720
And both of us were just staring at each other like,

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.720
this is the biggest piece that we've ever bought.

01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:59.720
Because normally we play games together,

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:01.720
share games together type thing.

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:03.720
You watch your dad play the second worst one.

01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:05.720
Oh, well, there you go.

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.720
Literally, I think we've got 20 minutes into it

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.720
and both of us were looking at each other like,

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:11.720
yeah, that game's going back.

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:13.720
We're going to hand it in for a different game.

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.720
Is there something you've always wanted to try

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.720
that you've made for 100% games that you've never wanted to try?

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.720
I've wanted to play Civ 6.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.720
I have done one run on it

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.720
and I enjoyed it, but I was very dumb.

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.720
I don't want to play Baldur's Gate.

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.720
I definitely want to try that for the first time.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.720
But I think it will be a patience testing stream

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:43.720
because I get worried about playing a game for the first time.

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:49.720
Five and six are some of the best solve ones, regardless.

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:51.720
Wow, feet for free.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.720
Congrats on monetization.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.720
Ding!

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.720
Let's just make sure I didn't lose anything.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.720
Right, I think I won.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.720
This one says, I think your feet are very beautiful and hot.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.720
Thanks. Do you have my toes?

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.720
I got my toes done.

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.720
Look at that step piece.

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.720
Look at that side profile on the toe spread.

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.720
Can I just get a zoom in and appreciation

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:15.720
for the side profile of the toe spread?

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.720
Yeah.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.720
I mean, look at that.

01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.720
You already know. You're welcome.

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.720
Yeah, you're welcome. You owe me one membership.

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.720
You're welcome.

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.720
The new Baldur's Gate?

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.720
Yeah, I've never played the Baldur's Gate, apparently.

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.720
Yeah, someone says it's cool, but apparently it's cool.

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.720
Delicious.

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.720
You played any RTS?

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:38.720
Starcraft?

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:40.720
No, my dad played it.

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.720
Age of Empires? No.

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.720
Civ 6 is a dumpster fire.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.720
Is that actually?

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.720
Didn't they not announce there's a new Civ 6 border?

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.720
Yeah, a new Civ coming out.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.720
Long toes.

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.720
Wait, they actually have long toes.

01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.720
Stop. Do I have long toes?

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.720
There you go. I'm going to start again.

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:03.720
Hold on. I'm going to get that really right.

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:04.720
Hold on.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.720
I don't know.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.720
I feel like I have the toe...

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:09.720
Because you can have...

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.720
Some people have toes that...

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.720
Oh, wait. Sorry. You can't see any of them.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.720
Hold on. Let's try it again.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:16.720
Some people have toes where they are all the same size.

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.720
They are all the same length.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.720
They come across like that.

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:22.720
Mainly the...

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.720
That shape?

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.720
I don't know if that makes any sense.

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.720
You feel cute.

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:28.720
Your toes are cute.

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.720
I'm going to start getting a complex about my freaking toes.

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.720
You don't...

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:35.720
Right. How long are my toes?

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.720
We'll do it in inches because you're all American.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.720
You said 2.5 inches is...

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720
Wait, hold on.

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:44.720
I'm trying to show you and do it at the same time.

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:46.720
Where is 2.5?

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:51.720
Where...

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.720
I am...

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.720
My index toe is just bigger than an inch.

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:58.720
Up there.

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.720
Sorry. I just hit the mic.

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:01.720
Oh, you're not American.

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:02.720
I'm sorry.

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:04.720
Hold on.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.720
Okay.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:06.720
Roughly...

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:08.720
3 centimeter toe.

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:11.720
I got 3 centimeter toe.

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:12.720
I am offended.

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:14.720
Long toe equals more than joy.

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.720
Well, fuck is an inch.

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.720
3 of these, baby.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.720
Measure the entire foot.

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:24.720
Oh, no.

01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:26.720
But then you will know that I've got big feet.

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.720
Oh, no.

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.720
My foot's bigger than the ruler.

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:32.720
If the ruler goes there, it's like way bigger.

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.720
If this ruler is 15 centimeters...

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.720
Wait, hold on.

01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.720
Let me put it as a thing.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.720
Okay. Put it on my heel.

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:43.720
And it's there on my toe.

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:46.720
So I'm like 16 centimeter feet.

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:48.720
Yeah.

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.720
Sorry. That was like the most known way to do it.

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.720
But I did it.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:55.720
Big feet are good.

01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.720
I'm glad you like them.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.720
But you have not big feet.

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:01.720
The mic is low.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:02.720
I don't know.

01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:03.720
I might have...

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:07.720
I genuinely thought I was like average on everything.

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:10.720
But then when I did the sweet-eating cam,

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:11.720
and everyone saw my hands,

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:12.720
they were like,

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:13.720
oh, your hands are so small.

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:15.720
But when we started measuring it together,

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:16.720
I was like, oh, okay.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.720
Imagine if this is popped right now,

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.720
because I'm a sweetie.

01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:30.720
Can you measure how wide you can spread your big toe?

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:31.720
And the one next to...

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.720
Wait, how wide?

01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:36.720
I don't know.

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.720
Like, because you could...

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:39.720
Like this?

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:40.720
Is that what you wanted?

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:41.720
Hold on.

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:42.720
Okay.

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:45.720
Thank you, Snowberry sweetie.

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.720
Like that?

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.720
Or do you mean like the actual width?

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.720
I don't know.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:53.720
It depends.

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.720
It has to be malleable.

01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:57.720
This is course measurement.

01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.720
It has to be malleable.

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.720
Like it has to be...

01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:02.720
Because I can grip stuff like...

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:03.720
Hold on.

01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.720
Let me just...

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.720
Hold on.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.720
Try moving it a little bit.

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:07.720
There you go.

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:08.720
There you go.

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:09.720
Just pop it there.

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:10.720
Good boy.

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.720
Tap.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:12.720
Headpats.

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:14.720
This.

01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:15.720
It depends,

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.720
because like that is...

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:18.720
You know.

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.720
I can put it in between my toes.

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:30.720
In the culture,

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.720
she would have nice grippers

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.720
down her renders and chat.

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:35.720
I guess your feet are small,

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:36.720
but it makes your toes

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:37.720
really long and compact.

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:38.720
No!

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:39.720
I'm going to get

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.720
a freaking complex after this dream.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:42.720
I just thought my feet

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.720
were really normal.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:46.720
Oh, my cat's meowing.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:47.720
Did you hear him?

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:50.720
Do you want in?

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:52.720
Did you hear that?

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:54.720
Hold on.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:56.720
Hold on.

01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.720
Let me get him.

01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.720
Baby boy.

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:01.720
You want in?

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:03.720
Baby boy.

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:05.720
Vigo.

01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:07.720
Vigo.

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:08.720
You can't just...

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:09.720
Oh.

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:10.720
Gimli.

01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:11.720
Gimli,

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:12.720
do you want to come on stream?

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.720
She's so confused right now.

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:17.720
She's like,

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:18.720
what are you doing?

01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:19.720
Gimli, come here.

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:21.720
Gimli,

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:23.720
come right here.

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:24.720
Come right here.

01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:25.720
Show the people

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:26.720
how adorable you are.

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.720
No, that's the wrong way.

01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.720
Gimli, what's this?

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.720
Gimli.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:33.720
Yes.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.720
Yes.

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:35.720
Okay,

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:36.720
just gently don't knock

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.720
over the webcam

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:38.720
or I'll cry.

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:39.720
Gimli.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:40.720
Don't knock over it.

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:41.720
Right.

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:42.720
Out.

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.720
Out.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.720
You're going to knock over the webcam.

01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:45.720
Gimli.

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:46.720
I'm sure.

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:47.720
I've only got 10 more minutes.

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:48.720
I'll be out in a minute, Gimli.

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:50.720
You can't go.

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:52.720
Give me 10 minutes,

01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:53.720
Gimli.

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:54.720
Just 10 minutes is all I need.

01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:55.720
Sorry.

01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:56.720
My tree was sweet to hear that.

01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.720
Mommy Gimli.

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:01.720
She was so going to knock over

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:02.720
that webcam,

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:03.720
so I was like,

01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:04.720
get out, Gimli.

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.720
I can tell.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:06.720
Oh.

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:08.720
Oh, I've done it now.

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:09.720
I haven't off.

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:11.720
Gimli, 10 minutes.

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.720
And I'm out.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:14.720
Stop it.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.720
Your dog is very cute.

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.720
Thank you.

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:26.720
I've been in...

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.720
I've certified for eight years

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:29.720
for your perfect.

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:30.720
Thank you.

01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:31.720
Literally,

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:32.720
I shouldn't have brought her in

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:33.720
because now she's going to

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:34.720
want the attention.

01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:35.720
And I was like,

01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:36.720
I'm not finished.

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:37.720
I'm not finished.

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:38.720
Give me 10 minutes, girls.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:40.720
10 minutes of getting

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.720
screamed at by a cat.

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.720
Literally,

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.720
a cat does not understand

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:45.720
the feed type.

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:48.720
She doesn't have a cat.

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:49.720
She has 10 doves.

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.720
And that was my Gimli.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.720
I thought it was my baby boy,

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:57.720
Vigo.

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:01.720
Thank you very much.

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:03.720
Votams.

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.720
And thank you for Rono.

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.720
I appreciate the gifts

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:08.720
and membership.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:09.720
I could...

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:12.720
Cats and the Feet.

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.720
Yes.

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.720
I picked up.

01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:15.720
Thank you.

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.720
Caleb Harris as well.

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.720
I adopted Vigo

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:21.720
and Gimli.

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:22.720
And their starting situations

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.720
are actually really sad,

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.720
but it's a really happy ending.

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:26.720
So I

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:28.720
I messaged a shelter

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:29.720
and I was like,

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.720
hey,

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.720
I work from home.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:33.720
I would love to

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:34.720
open up my home

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:35.720
to two cats

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:36.720
that cannot be separated.

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.720
If you didn't know

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:38.720
for adoption agencies

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:39.720
and all that kind of thing,

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.720
it's really hard

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:42.720
to be home doubles

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:45.720
that are inseparable.

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.720
So I messaged them

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:48.720
and they came back

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:49.720
and they were like,

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:51.720
we have these two ruffians.

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.720
They have come from

01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.720
an hoarder's home,

01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:56.720
which makes them un...

01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:58.720
They cannot be

01:48:58.720 --> 01:48:59.720
with any other animal,

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:00.720
but each other.

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:03.720
So I went

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:04.720
and visited them

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:06.720
and they were these

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:07.720
poor, scaredy cats.

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:09.720
They genuinely were

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.720
so terrified of any humans.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.720
Thank you, yummy,

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:14.720
for the memba.

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:16.720
Thank you for just like

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:17.720
remembering as well

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:18.720
for the correct tier.

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:19.720
I do apologize

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:20.720
about messing up that tier.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.720
Yes, they're a bonded pair

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:22.720
and they can't be separated.

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:23.720
But I just want to say

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:24.720
the universe works

01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:26.720
in mysterious ways.

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.720
Sorry, I know I'm supposed

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:28.720
to be doing ASMR,

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:29.720
but I'm just trying

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:30.720
to call them right now

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:31.720
without the mic on the floor.

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:33.720
The world will work

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:34.720
in mysterious ways.

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:35.720
Now I do not believe

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:36.720
in supporting certain

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:38.720
cat breeds,

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:39.720
which are bad for their health.

01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:40.720
An example of that

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.720
is the munchkin breed.

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:45.720
Vigo is mixed tabby

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.720
and munchkin breed.

01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:49.720
The universe

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:50.720
will fight

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:51.720
and the universe

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:52.720
will find ways

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:54.720
to laugh in your face.

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.720
Because I am a big believer

01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:58.720
and like completely

01:49:58.720 --> 01:49:59.720
no longer breeding them

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:01.720
and not letting them

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:02.720
be a genetic line

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:03.720
any further

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:04.720
because it's so bad

01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:05.720
for their health.

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:07.720
San Baroli,

01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:08.720
thank you very much.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:10.720
And then the universe

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:11.720
laughed in my face

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:13.720
and said,

01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:14.720
guess what?

01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:15.720
Your baby boy

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:16.720
is a half-foot

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:17.720
and I'm like,

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:18.720
okay.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.720
Both of them,

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:20.720
thank you for the upgrade.

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:22.720
So yeah,

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.720
if you ever think

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.720
the universe doesn't

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:26.720
have a little joke for you,

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:27.720
oh, I assure you,

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:28.720
the universe is going to,

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:30.720
it's got a joke for you.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.720
Yeah, like pugs,

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:34.720
yes, I am a bit of a

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.720
please don't support,

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:37.720
but this was just me,

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:39.720
like Scottish fold cats.

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:41.720
As adorable as they look,

01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:43.720
absolutely not.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:44.720
Hairless cats,

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:45.720
absolutely not.

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:46.720
A lot of people

01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:47.720
will say,

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:48.720
but I can look after them.

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.720
It's not about you looking after them.

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.720
It's about the general population

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:53.720
looking after them.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:55.720
Does the general population

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.720
going to do all these steps

01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:58.720
about looking after their cat

01:50:58.720 --> 01:50:59.720
and the hairless ones

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:00.720
getting out of bath

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.720
and removing the dirt cells

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:02.720
because it's not got

01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:03.720
freaking fur?

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:04.720
No, it's not.

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.720
Think of the bigger picture.

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:06.720
It's selfish.

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:07.720
Anyway,

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.720
don't get me started

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:11.720
on animal breeding

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:12.720
because a lot of it

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:14.720
is just absolutely insane.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:15.720
I'm waiting until you get started

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:16.720
and learn about

01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:18.720
what pedigree dogs are.

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:20.720
Pedigree dogs are just certified.

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.720
You'll literally get a certificate

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:24.720
saying, yes, this dog

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:25.720
has been produced via

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.720
freaking insane amounts of

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:28.720
zest.

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:29.720
And it was like,

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.720
why is pedigree even a thing?

01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:32.720
Get a mutt.

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:33.720
Muts are the healthiest kind of dog

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:34.720
you can even get.

01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.720
Ah, and mixed breed cats,

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:38.720
they're the healthiest kind

01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:39.720
you can get.

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:40.720
Don't support the little munchkins

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.720
that have freaking stilts for legs.

01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.720
It's actually so freaking sad.

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:45.720
And a canny,

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:46.720
oh, oh, I could really start

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:48.720
fucking beating my back.

01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:50.720
Right, can, can, can, can, can.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:51.720
Anyway, yeah,

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:52.720
the universe will always

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:53.720
have a joke for you.

01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:57.720
So, yeah,

01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:00.720
I despise munchkins.

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:01.720
I don't,

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:02.720
for the, for the kindness

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:03.720
of the poor cat,

01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:04.720
they shouldn't be a thing.

01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:05.720
And then the universe said,

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:06.720
oh, by the way,

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:07.720
Vigo is a half mix

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.720
of Tabby and munchkin.

01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:10.720
And yeah,

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.720
he has saucer eyeballs.

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:13.720
I should actually post

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:14.720
a picture of my baby

01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:16.720
but yeah,

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:18.720
Vigo has saucer eyeballs.

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:19.720
He's so adorable.

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:21.720
And the universe won

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:23.720
after that.

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:24.720
Hey,

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:25.720
do you do rabble and

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:26.720
dress streams where you

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:27.720
just go down a bunch of

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:28.720
rabbit holes?

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:29.720
Oh, absolutely.

01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:31.720
I did it in my

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:32.720
Skyrim one.

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:33.720
I started talking about

01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.720
the needy streamer

01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:35.720
overload ending

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:36.720
where she becomes a god

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:38.720
and starts a new

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.720
religion type thing

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:40.720
or like,

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:41.720
starts a new society.

01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:42.720
And like,

01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:43.720
I started talking

01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:44.720
about conspiracy theories

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:45.720
and stuff,

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:46.720
but I don't like going too

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:47.720
deep into it

01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.720
because I know it like

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.720
really just like

01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:50.720
people didn't like it.

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:51.720
So I was like,

01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:52.720
okay,

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:53.720
I will maybe do it too much

01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:54.720
and so does me.

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:55.720
My mom used to read

01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:56.720
Labrador's

01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.720
but regarding cats,

01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:58.720
McTess, yeah.

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:01.720
Vigo is just a small rock.

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:02.720
Every scrawny rage

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:03.720
makes me a lover

01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:04.720
even more awe.

01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:05.720
Vigo,

01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:06.720
yeah,

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:07.720
Vigo,

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:08.720
my cat sings Vigo after

01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:09.720
the guy,

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:10.720
did you know

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.720
and darted the rings

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:13.720
in the scene

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:14.720
where he kicks the helmet,

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.720
he was screaming for real.

01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:19.720
Do you want to know

01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:20.720
why he screamed out

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:21.720
for real like that?

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:22.720
Because

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.720
because he actually

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:24.720
booked his poop.

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:25.720
And yeah,

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:26.720
and yes,

01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:27.720
did you name

01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:28.720
your cats

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:29.720
after the Lord of the Rings?

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:30.720
Of course I named my cats

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:31.720
after the Lord of the Rings.

01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.720
Well,

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:33.720
would I name them

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:34.720
freaking Bill and Ben,

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:35.720
the flower pot men?

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.720
No,

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:37.720
I wouldn't.

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:39.720
So yeah,

01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:40.720
my baby boy,

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:41.720
my baby girl.

01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:42.720
And yes,

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:43.720
I gave

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:44.720
Gimli,

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:46.720
well yeah,

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:47.720
I gave Gimli a boy's name

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.720
technically.

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:49.720
But Gimli's got

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:50.720
ginger on her butt.

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:51.720
So,

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:52.720
Gimli,

01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:53.720
my homie now.

01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:54.720
Yeah,

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:55.720
yeah,

01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:56.720
name them,

01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:57.720
Bill and Ben,

01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:58.720
the flower pot men,

01:53:58.720 --> 01:53:59.720
honestly.

01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:01.720
Holy crap,

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:02.720
you just maybe remember

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:03.720
Bill and Ben.

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:04.720
I remember Bill and Ben.

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:06.720
JJ,

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:07.720
you've got a picture of me.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:09.720
Thank you for the membership,

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:10.720
JJ.

01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:11.720
I appreciate it.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:13.720
Just for all members

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:14.720
who are watching,

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:16.720
the membership stream

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:17.720
start next week,

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:18.720
but I promise you,

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:19.720
I will throw you into

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:20.720
the thick of it

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:22.720
and we'll

01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:23.720
have a lot of fun from there.

01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:25.720
We'll take it from there

01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:27.720
because this week

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:28.720
is kind of locked

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:29.720
in a little bit.

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:30.720
We do have a collab

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:31.720
again

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:32.720
with me

01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:33.720
and all my girls.

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:35.720
You are

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:36.720
an adorable girl.

01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:37.720
We love it.

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:41.720
Yes.

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:42.720
What's next?

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:43.720
Was it a gym?

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:44.720
Cute.

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:45.720
Yeah,

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:46.720
I'm not going to get

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:47.720
any more

01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:48.720
putters

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:49.720
after Vigo

01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:50.720
and

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:51.720
Gimli.

01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:52.720
I think

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.720
I will probably

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:55.720
have the biggest

01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:56.720
mental breakdown

01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:57.720
of my life

01:54:58.720 --> 01:54:59.720
once they pass.

01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:00.720
Thankfully,

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:01.720
I have them very young.

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:02.720
They,

01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:03.720
I think they're

01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:04.720
three years old.

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:06.720
Unfortunately,

01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:07.720
due to the hoarder situation,

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:08.720
they actually don't know

01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:09.720
what age

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:10.720
my baby boy and baby girl are.

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:12.720
Like,

01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:13.720
I was trying to get

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:14.720
as much information

01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:15.720
that they had,

01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:16.720
but they were just very honest

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:17.720
and said,

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:18.720
like, look,

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:19.720
we don't,

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:20.720
we don't actually

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:21.720
have information

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:22.720
on these babies.

01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:25.720
Strani,

01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:26.720
do you know

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:27.720
if you get a cut

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:28.720
of YouTube Premium membership

01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.720
watchers?

01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:30.720
I absolutely do.

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:33.720
If you pay for YouTube,

01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:34.720
oh, it used to be called

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:35.720
YouTube Red,

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:36.720
but if you do

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:37.720
YouTube Premium,

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:40.720
forever,

01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:42.720
however long you watch it,

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:43.720
like, I get a percentage.

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.720
So say you 100%

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:46.720
watched me.

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:47.720
I get 100%

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:48.720
of what you

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:49.720
generate

01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:50.720
for content creators.

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:51.720
Does that make sense?

01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:52.720
It's the only percentage

01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:54.720
base to the best they can.

01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:57.720
I've noticed my

01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:58.720
favorite troopers dabble

01:55:58.720 --> 01:55:59.720
in theories.

01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:00.720
Must be one of those jokes

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:01.720
from the universe.

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:02.720
Honestly, the universe

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:03.720
is a little funny joke for you.

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:04.720
Like, please,

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:06.720
if you're ever, like,

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:07.720
thinking,

01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:08.720
oh, there's nothing

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:09.720
interesting's gonna happen

01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:10.720
in my life,

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:11.720
I assure you,

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.720
the universe is cooking something.

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:13.720
Because I,

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:15.720
I am the biggest,

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.720
like,

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:17.720
don't support,

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:18.720
like,

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:19.720
pugs,

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:20.720
don't support

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.720
French Bulldogs,

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:22.720
like,

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:23.720
don't support

01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:24.720
munchkin cats,

01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:25.720
don't do this or that.

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:26.720
And then the universe goes,

01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:27.720
oh, by the way,

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:28.720
here's a half munchkin.

01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:29.720
I'm like,

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:30.720
oh, okay,

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:31.720
I see how it is.

01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:33.720
This squishy thing

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:34.720
is kind of hypnotic.

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:35.720
Yeah, you can, like,

01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.720
see the balls move around in it.

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:38.720
It's just quite nice.

01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:39.720
I quite like it.

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:45.720
It's, like,

01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:46.720
really therapeutic

01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.720
to, like,

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:48.720
squish down into it,

01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:49.720
honestly.

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:51.720
I'm not being,

01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:52.720
like, I genuinely

01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:53.720
wholeheartedly mean it.

01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.720
Like, it feels very nice

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:55.720
to, like, squish something

01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:56.720
under my feet.

01:56:58.720 --> 01:56:59.720
Got to go.

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:00.720
Have fun with the rest

01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:01.720
of the game.

01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:02.720
Congratulations.

01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.720
Thank you.

01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:04.720
Yes, please don't worry.

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:05.720
Can you go?

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:06.720
I'm going to redirect

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:07.720
into the sheebie.

01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:09.720
Actually,

01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:10.720
is she up right now?

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:13.720
Hold on.

01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:14.720
I'm leaning over.

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.720
She's live right now

01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:20.720
with another crab's treasure.

01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:21.720
Oh, yeah.

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:22.720
Apparently,

01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:24.720
the music in that game

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:25.720
is, like, so good.

01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:26.720
But it's a Dark Souls crab.

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:27.720
I thought it was, like,

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:28.720
a fun little crab game.

01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:29.720
I was going to play it

01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:30.720
and someone said it was, like,

01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:31.720
it's like Dark Souls

01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:32.720
and I'm like, bro,

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:33.720
if I can't,

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:34.720
if I can't tag in

01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:35.720
the reflins to help me,

01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:36.720
then that game,

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:37.720
there's a fight.

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:41.720
I will most likely do

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:44.720
a Talking Stream membership

01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:46.720
one for next week,

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:47.720
just because there's

01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:50.720
so many marshmallows

01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:52.720
I can't really say,

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:53.720
but we can see

01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:54.720
in another time.

01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:57.720
But yeah,

01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:58.720
I hope you enjoy this

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:00.720
role-play, role-play,

01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:01.720
it's not even role-play.

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:02.720
Literally, it wasn't even

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:03.720
ASMR.

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:04.720
I'm talking to you

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:05.720
at normal levels.

01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:06.720
I normally do it for streams,

01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.720
so it's all fake.

01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:13.720
It's a Souls crab game,

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:14.720
honestly.

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:15.720
Adjust the ears, boy.

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:16.720
Thanks for the stream, Sonny.

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:18.720
It's what's Sonny.

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:19.720
Strawny.

01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:20.720
Thank you, not Alessandro,

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:21.720
for the two.

01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:22.720
I appreciate it.

01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:23.720
I really hope

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:24.720
I've managed to say

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:25.720
everyone's names.

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:26.720
Thank you so much

01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:27.720
for your patience as well

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:28.720
as I completely messed

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:29.720
that stream up

01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.720
and wholeheartedly

01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:32.720
just, like,

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:33.720
yapping in tone.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:35.720
That's all we're doing here.

01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:38.720
Best stream I had

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:39.720
feet and a kitty.

01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:40.720
What more could I ask for?

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:42.720
Yeah, that was gimme.

01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:43.720
Love this.

01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:44.720
Thank you, Strawny.

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:45.720
Thank you, my stream.

01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:46.720
Thank you so much, yes.

01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:47.720
I will go now,

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:48.720
but thank you so much

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:49.720
to everyone who

01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:51.720
membershiped

01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:52.720
and gifted

01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:54.720
and download, etc.

01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:55.720
The membership streams

01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:56.720
start next week

01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:57.720
because this week's schedule

01:58:57.720 --> 01:58:58.720
had already kind of been

01:58:58.720 --> 01:58:59.720
locked in

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:00.720
and I didn't actually know

01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:01.720
what I was going to do

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:02.720
with the monetization.

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:04.720
Thank you, Dufus.

01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:05.720
Dufedoff

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:08.720
for the member.

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.720
And again,

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.720
if you can't membership,

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:12.720
please do not worry.

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:13.720
I always have

01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:14.720
free streams coming.

01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:15.720
I always have free content

01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:16.720
coming out.

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:17.720
You just need to

01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:18.720
give me a little patience.

01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:19.720
But the dust

01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:20.720
is definitely starting

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:23.720
to settle from debut,

01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:24.720
which means I can, like,

01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:25.720
fully focus on

01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:26.720
everything I want to do.

01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:27.720
Legs!

01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:28.720
Thank you for the five gifts.

01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:29.720
I appreciate it.

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:30.720
Congrats on those

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:31.720
who caught it

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:32.720
with your face.

01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:33.720
And all the music.

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:34.720
Thank you very much.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:35.720
That was very kind of you.

01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:36.720
But yes, the dust

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:37.720
is starting to settle,

01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:38.720
which is good

01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:39.720
because it means

01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:40.720
I can start focusing

01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:41.720
on the free content

01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:42.720
I want to do

01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:43.720
and all the stuff

01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:44.720
I want to

01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:45.720
think about.

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:46.720
But yes,

01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:47.720
please say hi to Shipee

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:48.720
for me.

01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:49.720
I will type a few

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:50.720
messages in her chat

01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:51.720
and then I am going

01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:52.720
to go soak

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:53.720

01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:54.720
and see what happens.

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.720
Yeah,

01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:56.720
my purr tub

01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:57.720
isn't doing

01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:58.720
so good.

01:59:58.720 --> 01:59:59.720
But we'll see.

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:00.720

Bye-bye for now,

02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:04.720

02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:05.720

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:08.720
microphone.

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:09.720
Can I kiss you

02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:10.720

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:11.720
