1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, I was over for you before we even got started.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello, are you there?

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Can you hear this little call of it?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello, my mouth is wiggling because I didn't put my lid on.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm cooking, I'm cooking.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So professional, so professional.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My cats are currently play-fighting.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So if you hear my cats play-fighting, it's going to be terrible.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I made the mistake of giving my cats what's called a licky lick.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Wait, I spelled permanent wrong.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not dead.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So if you're bumping about, my cats are going to absolutely wail.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hi.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now today is a very short stream.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But I should really sound like this for you.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Good morning.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Good evening.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And good afternoon.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I have lots of fun things to try.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I need to make myself louder or lower the background sound.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now I just want to say I'm not doing any permanent effects.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So don't worry, you're in good condition.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will look after you as I hear my cat bumping against my door.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hi.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now I spelled permanent but it remained in it.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now you all know.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Make it permanent.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Have to miss this stream, it's okay.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We're going nice and slow.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't normally use these eyes but I can't help it.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It was always permanent.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can now hear my cat run behind my couch.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, there she goes.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, and she's...

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, I think she's just jumped on the cardboard box now.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So take your time to relax.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think she's beaten up V-core right now.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Of course, she's been so good.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think she's beaten up V-core right now.

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But it's okay.

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So slowly, you can feel yourself starting to drift.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And that's okay.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Like that feeling, come over here.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No reflex, don't let go.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh no, is this ear broken?

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is this ear broken? Is this ear broken? Hello?

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh my gosh, wait, why is one ear stronger than the other?

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Both ears work.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, okay, I just said right into your ear that.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oopsies, sorry, I just whispered right into your ear.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The ear works, but as less equal, why would that be?

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If anything, can't go.

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know why, because my focus rate isn't equal.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Such a professional stream there.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No, I should say correct.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's okay if it's weaker.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I like them weak.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The bass part, hello.

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let this cobalt fish lure you to the depths.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:27,000
For no particular reason at all.

61
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, sorry, I did it twice, I had to make twice.

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm just gonna brush over your ears to give you the feeling of a false security,

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
as I'm sure I'm not planning anything else at all.

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Not one single thing.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We get to go down into the depths together.

66
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just me, and you, and my voice, and you listening in.

67
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, gently, brushing over your ears.

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And some cats, okay, maybe the caster.

69
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Wow.

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Gentle, gentle movements.

71
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have some good news for my reflinks.

72
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
My YouTube channel has been submitted for monetizing.

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, the heat just came on.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I need to go turn the heat off, I'm so sorry.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm so professional, let's go.

76
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Come on, it was me, I won't get all lost, being professional, it's me.

77
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
When can I start being myself, or do I need to keep being professional?

78
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The cat turned the heat on, because it wants attention.

79
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, give me five more minutes and I'll be serious, okay?

80
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The noise is encapsulating you.

81
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And you feel behind a sense of belonging.

82
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You could even think to yourself, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

83
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:38,000
If I gave up control, control to one particular girl, and it wouldn't be so bad.

84
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What's the worst that could happen from this little gullfish?

85
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Is there a cat in my room?

86
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No.

87
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay, I literally thought Gimli sneaked in there.

88
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:07,000
As I'm saying control yet, surely this gullfish means no harm.

89
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And even if it was for 24 hours, one day, one day, how much harm could you really be

90
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:39,000
under, or could be done in 24 little hours?

91
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No more harm at all.

92
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So slowly your mind wanders.

93
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What would this gullfish ask me to do?

94
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Only a few things, my dear refling.

95
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But some things can't be said, only guessed.

96
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You have to go into deeper parts of your mind to know and realize what this gullfish wants.

97
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And maybe my dear refling, you realize I want complete and total control of you.

98
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Would that be so bad?

99
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No.

100
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So maybe that 24 hours becomes 48, and then 48 becomes 72.

101
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And before you know it, this gullfish has had a week of you.

102
00:13:34,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Then two weeks, a month, or maybe just maybe this gullfish made breaks you.

103
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's just my things that I want.

104
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But you have to earn the things you want.

105
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So I need to bathe, don't I?

106
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I need to do the right things.

107
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So you're encapsulated by me, yeah?

108
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So how about just for now, I'll be a good girl for you.

109
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And maybe, just maybe, you'll be a very good boy for me.

110
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Does that sound like a plan, my dear refling?

111
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

112
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's see how much we can bathe together.

113
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's be on our best behavior then.

114
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll tell you a way that I can be good for you.

115
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll allow you, refling, to type sentences you want me to say in chat right now.

116
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And I just might go from ear to ear and gain more favor from you as I say what you want to hear.

117
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Does that sound like a plan?

118
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because I'd love to do that for you.

119
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Gain your favor, huh?

120
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Zepai means couple fish in Italian.

121
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hi, honey.

122
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
All hail the ref.

123
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're such a playful little thing, aren't ya?

124
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's why we have such fun together, isn't it, refling?

125
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I love you, refling.

126
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm proud of you.

127
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm proud of us.

128
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I'm totally not hypnotizing you right now.

129
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, you're not gonna be a loser, are you, refling?

130
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You're not gonna lose to me.

131
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't tell me this is enough to put you under my spell.

132
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You have to make me work for it, refling.

133
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You do less work really, really hard.

134
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Here we go.

135
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You can look in my eyes.

136
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Just done the spiral.

137
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Dear...

138
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Do you like looking into my eyes?

139
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think they're rather tantalizing, don't ya?

140
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I can make my eyes open wide like this.

141
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Staring right at you.

142
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I see you.

143
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And you see me.

144
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And you see everything I'm doing to you.

145
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Right at this very second.

146
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's okay.

147
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You can blink.

148
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But don't look away for too long.

149
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Remember, we have to behave for one another.

150
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Do you like that?

151
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll just tap on your ears gently, gently, gently, gently.

152
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You're more welcome.

153
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're more than welcome to blink and sink.

154
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I quite like that phrase.

155
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Blink and sink.

156
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's okay if your body starts to feel a bit weaker.

157
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And if your mind starts to wander.

158
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's okay.

159
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You may even say little refling.

160
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's by design.

161
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah.

162
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know.

163
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There's just something about you being a bit tired around me.

164
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Maybe you don't want to fade back.

165
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Not like you could by the time I'm done with you.

166
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
My little refling.

167
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Why don't you come a little bit closer?

168
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I promise I won't pay.

169
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No.

170
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,000
In fact, you may blink what you faint.

171
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:42,000
As you go deeper and deeper with me.

172
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Deeper and deeper, your thoughts are turning to confusion.

173
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What did you say?

174
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
With only my voice remaining in your head.

175
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You don't have to focus on a single thing other than what this alluring cuttlefish is seeing.

176
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There, there.

177
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Just look at me and forget.

178
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:37,000
All you need to know, refling, is that you're safe and you're in good hands with me.

179
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And by the time I'm finished with you,

180
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
you'll already want to be going under again.

181
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But little refling.

182
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll give you a tingle break, okay?

183
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll say more phrases shortly.

184
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But have a little break, break, break, break.

185
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
We need to take things slow.

186
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Think of it as an introduction to your induction.

187
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But please don't worry.

188
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
There will be no permanent effects in this dream.

189
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So you are welcome to go as deep as you like with me.

190
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah.

191
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Although I do admit this good girl likes it when you go deep.

192
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah.

193
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you for the deep little refling.

194
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You like when I do ASMR streams on you, huh?

195
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, I had plenty of time to think of how I could truly mean to break you.

196
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
This is one of many, okay?

197
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So to those who may be resistant, that's okay.

198
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because I'm coming for you.

199
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Do you understand?

200
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I will get you.

201
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That is my goal.

202
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And have I failed any of my goals so far?

203
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No little refling.

204
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So heed my warning.

205
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I am coming.

206
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah.

207
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Relax.

208
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
If you think my words are waking you up,

209
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:05,000
they should be slowly bringing you down.

210
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Down, down, down, okay?

211
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That's why we need a little timer.

212
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Where we just listen in.

213
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And whatever our brain and body decides will do.

214
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But that doesn't mean this cuttlefish can suggest a few things to you.

215
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah.

216
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Hey.

217
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Just let whatever happens happen.

218
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I won't be bidding you purposefully in a trance, okay?

219
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But if you just happen to be so well-drained,

220
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I welcome it entirely.

221
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I welcome my voice and encapsulating your mind.

222
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I welcome your full attention.

223
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So be good, little refling, and don't keep me waiting.

224
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah.

225
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You might feel it starting from your head

226
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and slowly a sensation radiates downwards

227
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
down to your neck, then your shoulders.

228
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And that sensation splits off.

229
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It splits going down your arms and chest at the same time.

230
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Slowly, slowly, slowly radiating its way through your body.

231
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Turn your stomach.

232
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Down, down, down.

233
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And past your hips.

234
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's already gone through your fingertips at this point.

235
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And down your legs, your thighs, your calves, your feet.

236
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Until that sensation is all over.

237
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
There's nothing you can do about it, but that's okay.

238
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Because the sensation is pleasant.

239
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's warm.

240
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It feels comforting.

241
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's hard for you to describe, but that's okay.

242
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I will do the talking for the both of us.

243
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That sensation is you possibly entering a trance, and that's okay.

244
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's nice when I'm in control.

245
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's nice when you let me in control.

246
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Enjoy the feeling, okay?

247
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Enjoy the sensation.

248
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We're both doing it together, aren't we?

249
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah.

250
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah.

251
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Good.

252
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
For you.

253
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Are your limbs feeling heavy?

254
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's okay, little reef like, that's just a side effect.

255
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But over time, you'll make enjoy it.

256
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Because when your limbs feel heavy, that's when you know, that's when you know this kind of fish.

257
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
As in control.

258
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I'll keep you safe when you're with me, okay?

259
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay, little reef like.

260
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
For you.

261
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
For you, little reef like.

262
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
This is all by your choice.

263
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Although you might be too deep, should I bring you back up?

264
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Or are you strong enough to give me some phrases you want to hear?

265
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Do you think you could do that for me, little reef like?

266
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You tell me what you want to hear, and this kind of fish will be, will both be good for each other.

267
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because I'm ready to obey you.

268
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You're doing such a good job.

269
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm so proud of how far you've come, little reef like.

270
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Back and forth.

271
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Ear to ear.

272
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yeah.

273
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You did good today.

274
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And I can see how hard you're working.

275
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Well done, little reef like.

276
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well done.

277
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You're a good boy, and I'm a good girl.

278
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Together we'll have lots of fun.

279
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Just surrender and let me take control.

280
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
My little reef like.

281
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.

282
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You always do.

283
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Don't ya?

284
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And I'm sure you'll make it through.

285
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's hard right now, but you'll make it through.

286
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You always do.

287
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Don't ya?

288
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And I'll be there on the other side, cheering you on.

289
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Oh, my little reef like, would you kindly be a good little boy for mommy?

290
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh, you're so heavy and so deep.

291
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And so happy to give yourself to me.

292
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Resistance is futile at this point.

293
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Just give in, give up.

294
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
My strength is unrelenting, my stamina unending.

295
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
One way or another, you are main.

296
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Core.

297
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Okay.

298
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Let's relax, relax, relax, relax.

299
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
There we go.

300
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'll bring you back up a little.

301
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I don't want you guys to get so deep now.

302
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This was supposed to be a very gentle and secret induction.

303
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I'll do some more little tingles.

304
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh, my reeflings.

305
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I don't know if I should bring you back up,

306
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:33,000
or if I should leave you in the trance if you're in one then.

307
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You want to go a little deeper?

308
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I need to be gentle with you, though.

309
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Don't you see?

310
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I've had so much time to think of how hard I was going to...

311
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
What's the word, eh?

312
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
How hard I was going to go on you.

313
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And I need to be able to not break you.

314
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't want to break you, no more.

315
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I want to mate, break you.

316
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But that takes time.

317
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We just need to spend a little more time together.

318
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
My stomach is making noises, I root.

319
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
If you bring us back up, it makes dropping back down even better.

320
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Please, oh.

321
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
For you guys.

322
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah, just relax and let loose all of this burden.

323
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Because when you're under, I'll be supporting you.

324
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And I'll caress all over you, look after you.

325
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I can only say the rest of it.

326
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Over reeflings.

327
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Okay, I'm going to slowly bring you back again.

328
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And just take your time, slowly.

329
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You can feel yourself come up.

330
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That heavy feeling that's all over your body

331
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is lifting slowly.

332
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Reversing from the path it once took.

333
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
From your feet to your calves and thighs.

334
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Your thoughts are becoming their own again.

335
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That sensation coming back up, up, up your body.

336
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Past your hips, your stomach, your chest.

337
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Your fingertips, your hands to your elbows, your shoulders slowly up, up, up.

338
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Until that sensation goes back to your collar, your neck, your head.

339
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Until you're here again, little reefling.

340
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Welcome back to the land of the living.

341
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Hi, reefling. Did you have fun?

342
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yeah, good morning.

343
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Good morning, little reefling.

344
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
That's my tracking every such a silly day. Hold on.

345
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You need to calibrate.

346
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Wow, calibration complete.

347
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Johnny returns.

348
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
The meme lord herself.

349
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
My cup of tea got cold.

350
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I got really into that. I'm sorry, I really got into that.

351
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But my cup of tea is cold, so I can't have my cup of tea.

352
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Good morning, little reefling, or afternoon, or evening, or good time zone.

353
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Oh, let me, uh, this is more me, I think. Yeah, yeah, this is more me.

354
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Microwave the tea, reefling, don't be so silly.

355
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Special thank you again to Anonymous for the tip.

356
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Anonymous said, holy moly, this ace of art stream is so good.

357
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Thank you very much. Yeah, that was my true heart in.

358
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
But now you've got the meme lord me.

359
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Get wrecked.

360
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's very unlikely I will pull that off again in this stream,

361
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
because I am fricking rubbish at being fricking, uh, what's the word?

362
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Serious. Yeah, I should probably, uh, maybe we just, uh, camera thing.

363
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Hi, it's me. I'll leave the background, it's quite soothing, but it's me again. Hi.

364
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I reefling.

365
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That cramp lunch box, that's right, get knocked on. Yeah.

366
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Are you enjoying Aces? Oh, Anonymous. I can't say Brian.

367
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Ah, thank you for the tip, Anonymous. Anonymous is trying to cute. Yeah, we cute up in her.

368
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Gremlin's back, oh baby, so don't be expecting any serious to come out of my mouth for the rest of this stream.

369
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Like, if you're here, if you're here for the, that section we just did, sorry.

370
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
The meme-er, the meme-er is back, okay? My voice is right from RuneScape yesterday.

371
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:53,000
But I do plan on doing weekly ASMR streams, which is why I do say please like and subscribe for more.

372
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Uh, the fantastic news, my little reeflings, the fantastic news is my channel is being submitted for monetization,

373
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:10,000
which means I can finally start uploading my ASMR videos for my 1000, so thank you.

374
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm already on 4000 subscribers, which is amazing, which means I owe you, yes you, listening in.

375
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That's right, this streamer owes you content.

376
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So I have four ASMR videos getting ready.

377
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So we've submitted my channel to YouTube, and I'm sure they're gonna really like that.

378
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
James Cameron's avatar stream, yeah.

379
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
When I absolutely raged.

380
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But yeah, the meme-er is back, don't be expecting anything, but how good does this ASMR sound?

381
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So how good does this?

382
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Oh, I should maybe take off the hypno background.

383
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Now you get to hear my stomach even more.

384
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Thank you for the tip.

385
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, Irfan Piscotti, thank you for the tips.

386
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Thank you, Momay, very nice and relaxing.

387
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I've got you, like, down there.

388
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Though returning to Kremlin mode is good too, yeah.

389
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
That's more like me.

390
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Best of luck on monetization.

391
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Thank you for the tip, and yes, um, for that kind of thing, I'm most likely gonna be doing free content on Twitter.

392
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Milk Cadmus, thank you for the tip.

393
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That was amazing.

394
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Please, for the love of all, that is strongly keeping our cut by all of this posted.

395
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I never did anything wrong in this stream.

396
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I have done everything correct.

397
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But this, this is a sensory toy, and it's my favorite ASMR trigger right now.

398
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Listen to it.

399
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Isn't that amazing?

400
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Thank you so much for that tip, Milk Cadmus.

401
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But yeah, I didn't do anything wrong this stream.

402
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But if you didn't know, AC Snowballs is live right now doing a DJ session.

403
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So if you're needing this to be a bit more, if you're needing a bit more hype for your stream,

404
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
definitely check her out.

405
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
M-A, Shabby, and Zara.

406
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I believe we're all going live as well.

407
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
This is the shortest stream for me.

408
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
We will be redirecting into Shabby Cottonbomb.

409
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Sounds like a piece of rubber stuck to the surface.

410
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

411
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Hey, yeah, I was a good girl this stream.

412
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I did everything correct, yeah.

413
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Sounds like one of those squeeze stress toys.

414
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

415
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah.

416
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I just don't want to risk it, and also you only want to say the name right.

417
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I don't even know why I said it.

418
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I forgot.

419
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Wait, you're going already?

420
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
No.

421
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm gonna do, Jen, I'm gonna do Kremlin ASMR.

422
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm gonna do ASMR like me.

423
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Look, I even have this to put on your ears.

424
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Are you ready?

425
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Look, look, look, look, look.

426
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm gonna put this on your ears.

427
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Ready?

428
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Look.

429
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You're almost home.

430
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
You can do ASMR.

431
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah.

432
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
This is nice.

433
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm rubbing them all against your ears.

434
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I put winter earmuffs on your ears.

435
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Wow, dinner didn't stream with absolutely no ears.

436
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
What do you mean by cats fighting at the start of the stream?

437
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm not gonna leave a like, and then don't leave my son.

438
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah, you're so fluffy.

439
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You're so fluffy.

440
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You're so fluffy.

441
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
First time I was into ASMR, I'm gonna come back for more.

442
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Glad I could take it.

443
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It's nice to have a short stream to recover from your infinite stamina.

444
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
My voice is really broken, but because I'm whispering, you can't tell it's broken.

445
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Some people like chugging ASMR.

446
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I have lots of chugging.

447
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Water.

448
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Okay.

449
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Have I been a good girl for you?

450
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Wait, wait, wait.

451
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah, I forgot my tea.

452
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I've got a cold cup of tea over here.

453
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But it was a lot of fun doing that ASMR.

454
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And really, sorry, my throat is making throat noises.

455
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah, but this is just kind of a little bit of a challenge.

456
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm gonna do ASMR.

457
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah.

458
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yeah, but this is just gonna be an easier stream.

459
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Because I don't want to break my voice.

460
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
This is the closest I've ever been to being fully transitive.

461
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I'm usually so focused on trying to go under.

462
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
See, but I think because I didn't plan any of what I was seeing,

463
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
because I was like natural, it made it easier to enjoy.

464
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
You know?

465
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
That's probably why.

466
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Be a good girl and swallow what you...

467
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Reflings, we're trying to leave this up.

468
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Will you ever do a full hypno video?

469
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah, definitely.

470
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I need to make sure I make it safe though.

471
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I need to educate myself a bit more, because I need it all to be safe.

472
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Which is why I'm not doing any permanent effects on this stream.

473
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Because I may or may not have an interest in permanent effects,

474
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
but I already have an audio recorded that undoes any effects that I may do on you.

475
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But I really like the permanent effects stuff.

476
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm sorry, it's just what I'm interested in.

477
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And I may want to break you a little bit, but just a little bit.

478
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's not going to be bad or anything.

479
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Like it's just going to be a wee bit of breaking, okay?

480
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Just a wee bit.

481
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Not a big bit.

482
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So yeah, I need to make sure I do it 100% safe.

483
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And it's filbert.

484
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Break me moment.

485
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
To keep up the buns, I just have to say, you and your eyes wear a strong ashing.

486
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Thank you.

487
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I love it.

488
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
If you need to present, break, take or leave it.

489
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And before we commit more times.

490
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Hey, yeah.

491
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Effects like what?

492
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Oh, so there's like different kinds of like hypno.

493
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And so you can purposely make like trainer ones where like I train you.

494
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Like I literally path off your subconscious to react to me or to do something.

495
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Or react in a certain way.

496
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And I need to make sure it's super safe.

497
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And I need if I do an audio that basically states that like I don't have an effect on you anymore.

498
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
It tells your subconscious to throw everything that you learned out the window.

499
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And then it's all safe.

500
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Welcome to Stronikato's YouTube where safety number one priority.

501
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Thoughts already doomed.

502
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Stroni and her permanent effect will be like you will only do your thing to me.

503
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Basically, kind of.

504
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's the plan.

505
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I want to do like sessions that last two hours long.

506
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I can't wait.

507
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I know my voice is going to be fried, but yeah.

508
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Will there be lullabies for the replaying?

509
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
My voice is broken, but I know you are my sunshine.

510
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You are my sunshine.

511
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
My only sunshine.

512
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You make me happy.

513
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
When skies are gray.

514
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You'll never know dear.

515
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm a giant of you.

516
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So please don't take my replaying away.

517
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Lullabies!

518
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I don't know many other lullabies.

519
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Freerishaka, Freerishaka.

520
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Dormithu, Dormithu.

521
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Would be cool if you had a button that made the camera zoom in on your eyes.

522
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Or, well, next stream I'll have a tracker so it follows my head around.

523
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So you can't escape my eyes.

524
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
But I wanted to go very easy.

525
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Very easy on the first one.

526
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Please don't take my sunshine away.

527
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Dormithu, Dormithu.

528
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
There is that cradle one.

529
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The cradle you will fall.

530
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Rock by baby on the tree top.

531
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.

532
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I don't know the rest.

533
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
What were your inspirations for being?

534
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I have no theme to career.

535
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I've always, always loved it.

536
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I've always loved it.

537
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
But I have always known how deep the rabbit hole goes.

538
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And I've touched on surface level.

539
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But I was like, I want to go, I want to go rabbit hole.

540
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Sorry, the wire is spilling on the desk.

541
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I, I want to go all in, baby, all in.

542
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So, well, the table at the top will be fixed.

543
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I can fix it now if you tell me how to spell the word.

544
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
What's the word?

545
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Be'er me, was it?

546
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Ah, bear me.

547
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Be'er me, I knit it.

548
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Be'er me, I knit it.

549
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Okay, then you'll just let that sit.

550
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Okay, you even have to bring Cremlund.

551
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Cremlund, know.

552
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Cremlund.

553
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Wow, look at that.

554
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Super professional.

555
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Sorry.

556
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
We're going down the after-roll.

557
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:48,000
After all, yeah, there's like so much to it that I just knew I couldn't do it until, until it would stay.

558
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And now it's time.

559
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Well, tippy tippy, I'm crimsonized, yeah.

560
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Don't be expecting anything serious from me.

561
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Oh, did you, like, make my head load, obnoxiously load my keyboardist?

562
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Oh, yeah, it's so good.

563
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So I, for triggers, I like double finger-clicking.

564
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I like finger-clicking.

565
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:31,000
For words or phrases, I want to do what you kindly, I want to do mehabs, because I say mehabs all the time.

566
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Mehabs, refling, you want to go deeper?

567
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Would you kindly, refling, go deeper with me?

568
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Like, oh, those are such good trigger words.

569
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But yeah.

570
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Is Strony susceptible to hypnosis?

571
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yes!

572
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
My biggest enemy are mirrors.

573
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Unfortunately, I can fall to my own hypnosis, but it only lasts 24 hours.

574
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It's fine, it's fine.

575
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Would you kindly, would be a lyric?

576
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Yes, we're literally doing it off of BioShock.

577
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Look, look, um, we're gamers out here, okay?

578
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:23,000
We're gamers, we're here for the memes as well, but it doesn't mean we can't incorporate

579
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
our favorite games into our other activities.

580
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Strony drilling on the floor in front of a mirror.

581
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Stop, I want to order so much artwork about all these, like, different plots.

582
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I'm like, oh no, the reflings have found me.

583
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Just going to beat you into a mirror.

584
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:55,000
We didn't, oh no, but we are doing hypnosis in general, but I've already done the segment

585
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:03,000
because I need to be gremlin gamer mode right now, because it's me, I can't help it.

586
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm just a freaking meme lord, it's hard to be serious, okay?

587
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah, enjoy the memes while enjoying our, you didn't finish that segment.

588
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Why are you not finishing?

589
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
We're not here gaming.

590
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
We're only big gamers here, you dun scoops.

591
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Remember that a man, a man leads a slave obeys, and reflings we obey.

592
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
What the orges come from the cutie?

593
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yeah, put on a suit for your serious stream.

594
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Oh, a man chooses, oops, sorry, a man chooses a refling obeys.

595
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Oh wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, wait, pause, pause, pause the tunes.

596
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Okay, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.

597
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Oh hi, I see in berries, hold on, we're caught in bio shock.

598
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:15,000
A man chooses a refling obeys.

599
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Oh wait, why is my freaking calibration, I was looking at the polling.

600
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Hi, A.C. in snowberries, I promise I'm not trying to hypnotize you, we're in gremlin hours, okay?

601
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Hi, A.C. girl, I was your rave, I hope your voice is okay, I was watching you in the bath again.

602
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I take a bath every morning to try and steam my throat before stream, and A.C. is live, so I was watching her, and she dressed up as a princess the way Mercy Drew are.

603
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
If you guys didn't see Mercy Drew, I'll turn it off, it was amazing.

604
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Maybe at the end of stream, I will do, I will do, maybe, serious mode, okay?

605
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I'm actually gonna make sure I'm reading into Sheebie, sorry, I'm reflecting to the screen right now.

606
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:28,000
But yeah, let's just, hold on, customization, redirect, we partied now, all the snowberries are tired, little babies.

607
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Sheebie's playing call of the lamb, oh my god, I think me and Sheebie may be doing multiplayer call of the lamb.

608
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Is it Sheebie first and then Azura, and then Mercy?

609
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Who's coming online first, Azura or Mercy?

610
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Eh, Azura or Sheebie?

611
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Shoulda picked Mercy.

612
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Uchi-san, party, hot, tall, that's terrible.

613
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Did Uchi-sans have a good time, or are you all ready for a nap after that?

614
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Hold on, I'll just check, who comes online first.

615
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Is it Azura or is it Azura, Azura?

616
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Wait, where's, I just announced the girls on my screen.

617
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But yeah, first Azura live in, how long?

618
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Azura's live, oh wait, in 5, 10?

619
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Okay, no, it's definitely Sheebie that comes up next.

620
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Sorry, it was amazing, oh Uchi-sans, time to put you to sleep.

621
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Come here old man, you're done for.

622
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:51,000
You partied so hard with Azura, and she showed you how much energy she has, yeah.

623
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Oh, and if you sub all your energy, Uchi-san, they may pay you to sleep.

624
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Better grant them.

625
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I'm ready to jump on my man.

626
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Yeah, I made a little induction at the end of the stream, but right now we're Kremlin mode, okay?

627
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I can't be serious.

628
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I laughed, I cried, I oooged, I am I supposed to even pronounce that?

629
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Even in our ASMR stream, she speaks fast.

630
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Oh yeah, you think that's speaking fast?

631
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Can you be serious, not for long?

632
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Kremlin mode activated, yeah.

633
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Shhh, we're real ASMRs out here.

634
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I'm speaking in a chanted main craft table.

635
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It's pronounced U-O, U-O.

636
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Surely you can be serious, but what was that?

637
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It's called Ace Globes, because A.C. finished their stream, I'm using Ace Globes.

638
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I fell farther in love with my cute and funny Uchi-san loving Oshii, and this is why we don't have chat on screen during ASMR streams.

639
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
What is that? It's the unknown.

640
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Ace should introduce you to Aigar, his Aigar.

641
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Ace Globes are so nice, yeah.

642
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Mercy had some Ace Globes in her ASMR, and Amy got skamaste on Ace Globes.

643
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I don't know if she said the story yet, so I'll let her tell the story.

644
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Ah, I feel better already.

645
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
You and Aigar will get along well.

646
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I feel better already, yeah.

647
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
There's no permanent influence on this stream, what does that mean?

648
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So some hypnosis ASMR is like to mark you and leave you with a present,

649
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and I'm not doing that because we are slowly working our way.

650
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,000
You have to take things slow and take your time,

651
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:56,000
and I'm gonna take my time with you briefly and get you all tired.

652
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Oh, it's a reference to the polar bear game.

653
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Would you ever use water next to a $2,000 microphone?

654
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I don't know, this is the best water you're gonna get.

655
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Permanent hypnosis is just a gift that keeps on giving.

656
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Slow indoctrination.

657
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Would you kindly rethink?

658
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Let me do what I want to, yeah.

659
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It's time to come down from the party snowmaries.

660
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You're under the sea, don't need hypnosis for that.

661
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Today was already a chill day for me, so this stream was really fit, and I'm glad.

662
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I'll try to do ASMR streams every week.

663
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yeah, my back hurts, okay, true OG sounds for it.

664
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But yes, I will do ASMR every week.

665
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Some more intense than the others.

666
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Some plots as well, like fill, probably plots, egg and live.

667
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And I do, like, when I get you guys to talk and give me suggestions,

668
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I do apologize if you typed for me to say something.

669
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I had to make sure it fitted with the theme,

670
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
which is why I brought you up so I can start being a gremlin again,

671
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
because I didn't want you to be down and be gremlin mode.

672
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Big Willy Wallace is probably when my back's gone after that DJ stream.

673
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That's so good.

674
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I break from my own mind every year.

675
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh yeah, some good plots.

676
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Oh yeah, some real deep thought-provoking plots.

677
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Okay, let me see if this is a freaking dragon.

678
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I think, because I want to show off.

679
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Okay.

680
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Okay, I think this better.

681
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
My mouse dragon just kind of stops working after all,

682
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
saying, I think it gets confused with the ASMR mic.

683
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You like the background, thanks.

684
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I made it myself.

685
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I did it.

686
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I'm not like it in Adobe After Effects.

687
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Bass streamer and vealer.

688
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
All my girls were bass streamer and vealer.

689
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
They're all the best.

690
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah, no.

691
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
You do, you strong, we still love you.

692
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Yeah.

693
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
That background is amazing, yes.

694
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I can also go faster or slower,

695
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
but I'll do that another time.

696
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But just so that I can really make it intense, okay?

697
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Like, this sound you hear,

698
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I can also make it faster and more intense.

699
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So please don't think I haven't thought this through.

700
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Wait, wait, wait.

701
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It's over for you.

702
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Don't resist.

703
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
There's no point in resisting.

704
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Okay, little wreathling.

705
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
You are mine.

706
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Just give me some time.

707
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Just let me kick.

708
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Let me kick.

709
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
There.

710
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And then what?

711
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Oh no, all my money's going into your pocket.

712
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
That's terrible, wreathling.

713
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah.

714
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
That sin doesn't have any side effects.

715
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
No, none of them have secret.

716
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I have no secret agenda.

717
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Thank you, window for cracking during the ASMR stream.

718
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That window cracked like three times during my segments.

719
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I was like, really, you're getting rude.

720
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I wasn't sure if I liked the background noise,

721
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
but I really like it.

722
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Oh, if you don't like that noise,

723
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
don't worry, I'll train you to like it.

724
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Just stop resisting.

725
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Your efforts are futile.

726
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You will not win against me.

727
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I have unending stamina.

728
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Are my streams not proof enough?

729
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Wah, thank you for today.

730
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Erwin Blair, thank you for the tip.

731
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Yes, let's give all money to feel it.

732
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Thank you for the tip, Erwin.

733
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Support my babies.

734
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Support my babies so they can move out,

735
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and I can buy them a better internet connection.

736
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Thank you so much for the tip, though.

737
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I appreciate it greatly.

738
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I need some hydration.

739
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You can hear some ASMR calls.

740
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Ah, all gone.

741
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Ah, none left.

742
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Thank you.

743
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Wow.

744
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Strani, does the cuttlefish's rope effect only have one speed?

745
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yes, only one speed.

746
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I didn't want people to think I'm doing a rave.

747
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I'll fight Mummy's unending stamina with my own.

748
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Let's see how it comes out on top.

749
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Me.

750
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Oh, the cuttlefish is amazing.

751
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
The cuttlefish is gonna give...

752
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Ay-yo, I can't read that out.

753
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Oh, my money's gonna skew, gosh.

754
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
For those of you who did join in a little late,

755
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:34,000
my YouTube channel's been spent for monetization.

756
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I'm actually getting a manicure and a pedicure today

757
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
in preparation for my monetization stream.

758
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
So there's your hint.

759
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Hopefully it comes through quickly.

760
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And I'm very excited.

761
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Zeroed in audible.

762
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, I did it into my...

763
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

764
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

765
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But yeah, I'm getting my first ever manicure and pedicure.

766
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I have no idea what...

767
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
So I think they like massage your legs as well.

768
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So I'm gonna like get nice and smooth and like shave my legs.

769
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Just to make sure they don't have to touch my like stubbly legs.

770
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
But yeah, I will be interesting.

771
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Maybe I should like live tweet my experience

772
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
and being like, oh, the person's doing this now.

773
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
They're doing this to my foot.

774
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Because I've never had like a pedicure is when it's your feet.

775
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Because pediatry is feet care.

776
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And then manicure, mangy tuples are your hands.

777
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And well, the rest of the VL urgent begin monetization too.

778
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Yes, they are being submitted today.

779
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I believe we are waiting for the YouTube stats to update.

780
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Because they're taking their sweet time.

781
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It took a week for the statistics to update.

782
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And then everyone is doing their monetization celebration streams.

783
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And ooh, everyone's eating good.

784
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
That's all I'm gonna say.

785
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It may as well be...

786
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Oh no, it may as well be Thanksgiving.

787
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:34,000
What the fuck?

788
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
My tech...

789
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
What?

790
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
What the fuck?

791
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
My phone?

792
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
My phone?

793
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
My tech talk?

794
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I was so scared.

795
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Oh my god.

796
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I was so scared.

797
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
My phone...

798
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
My tech talk just opened up on its own.

799
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Bruh.

800
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
China's listening in.

801
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
What the fuck?

802
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
What the fuck?

803
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
My phone just opened up on its own.

804
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
To play a freaking advertisement to me.

805
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
What was that?

806
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I thought someone was outside in the garden.

807
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I was like, oh my god, there's someone outside my house.

808
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I need to end the stream right now.

809
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That was scary.

810
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Oh my god.

811
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I got so scared there.

812
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I was like, what?

813
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
China, I'll prove to you, sir.

814
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
My Chinese credit just went up by 100K.

815
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
That was horrifying.

816
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I thought that was...

817
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I got freaking out.

818
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I was like, what?

819
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I should be the only thing making noise.

820
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
What was that?

821
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Wow.

822
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
My heart rate has accelerated.

823
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Literally, my social credit just went up.

824
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
What on earth?

825
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I think that was an ad because I opened tech talk.

826
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:18,000
And then, like, it loaded a video or something.

827
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
We can hire her.

828
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
She said, okay, I'm not doing hypnosis.

829
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I'm gremlin mode.

830
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Read the top.

831
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
That's what you get for having TikTok.

832
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
That's what I get for brain run.

833
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
That was scary.

834
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Jeez.

835
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Okay, what was I saying before that?

836
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Oh, monetization.

837
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Wait, is monetization a trigger word for the TikTok spies?

838
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
They want the money too.

839
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
What is it?

840
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Oh, do you want RBSMR?

841
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I don't think I have a ceiling on it.

842
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
A member ceiling.

843
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
The numbers made fun, honestly.

844
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Because I was talking about monetization and then the hand.

845
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
TikTok loves monetization.

846
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I said, yeah, give me some of that.

847
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Jeez.

848
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Okay.

849
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Let's drag you back into ASMR.

850
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
That freaked me out.

851
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
That was scary, because I was like, hello?

852
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Hello, who's there?

853
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Refill yourself.

854
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Refilling is like you.

855
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Okay.

856
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Just save money.

857
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Shhh.

858
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I accidentally woke up.

859
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
What happened?

860
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
My freaking phone started playing ads.

861
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Even though I didn't touch my phone at all.

862
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I don't like, I'm not bringing.

863
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I don't like that.

864
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
That was scary.

865
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
We're in your walls.

866
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Oh my gosh.

867
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Okay, let's see if we can do RBSMR.

868
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I need to put you over my hoodie, okay?

869
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
But maybe a little loud.

870
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
But this is my heart.

871
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I'll do this side, because it's easier.

872
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You have one.

873
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Thank you.

874
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Can you hear it?

875
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Can you hear my heart at all?

876
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Yeah.

877
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
That's my heartbeat.

878
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Is it fast or slow?

879
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It might be fast, because I'm talking.

880
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
That's why at the doctor's office,

881
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
they tell you not to talk when you take the pressure cuff on your arm.

882
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Do you want to see how fast my heart can go?

883
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
We're going to mess around, okay?

884
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I'm going to turn the volume down.

885
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Okay.

886
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And that's just my heart.

887
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm hearing mummies.

888
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
You heard my stomach sound.

889
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Stop.

890
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
That's how fast my heart can really go.

891
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Can I ruin a surprise for you guys?

892
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Because it's my content, I'm allowed to ruin the surprise, okay?

893
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
The stomach was louder than the heart.

894
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I'm going to do an ASMR video, like a role play,

895
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
where you are pregnant and you're in my tummy

896
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
and I'm talking to you about how proud I am

897
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and how excited I am for everything you're going to achieve in your life.

898
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
And I can't wait for you to experience the world

899
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and it's going to have my actual heartbeat and stomach zones in it.

900
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And I'm going to tell you all that you deserve,

901
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
all the good things in life that happen.

902
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And I'm going to be your cheerleader.

903
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And yeah, I need to get the Artwork Commission though,

904
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
because I need to draw me pregnant with you in my tummy.

905
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And I'll be wearing like a mummy outfit and everything.

906
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,000
So yeah, and I'm going to tell you how excited I am for you

907
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,000
to get to know you and I get to see what your personality is like

908
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
and you're going to be perfect in every way,

909
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
because there's no way that my little reef link can do any wrong.

910
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
That's strangely, yeah, and you're going to hear my tummy sounds

911
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and my heartbeat and my voice is going to be muffled.

912
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
It's going to be like this, okay?

913
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
This is what my voice is going to sound like.

914
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
And I'm so proud of you.

915
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Oh, my voice is so broken.

916
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I'm sorry I broke my voice, so this doesn't sound very pleasant.

917
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But I'm so proud of you and I can't wait to meet you

918
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and I can't wait to watch you grow up

919
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
and do all the things you love

920
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
and see what hope is you fall in love with.

921
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
And you're going to be so smart like your mummy.

922
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Your broken voice sounds like sadness.

923
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Oh, no, no, I know it's sad.

924
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I'm sad that I didn't have my cup of tea,

925
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
but I had a lot of fun getting you very deep into the moment.

926
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Who's the daddy?

927
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
You again, reef link.

928
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Don't you not know the feeler lore?

929
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
The reason why I have five dollars is all because of the reef links.

930
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,000
See, in order to make sure that no one reef link can claim that they're the daddy,

931
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
all of us got together, turned the lights out and just went for it.

932
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Okay, we just went for it.

933
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
That's how we have five dollars.

934
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:18,000
We should do that again sometime.

935
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
You want to find you will both get the ace more both hired out.

936
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:29,000
We've actually been confirmed that we are showing up to a convention, but it's in 2025.

937
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But I think it's in California.

938
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Ah.

939
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Yeah.

940
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I'm all the reeflings on the daddy. No, I won't take my mists.

941
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
But yeah, very excited.

942
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I don't know, it would be nice if we could all meet up at a convention, but I don't know how the girls feel about her.

943
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And I have absolutely horrific travelling, sorry.

944
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So I'm gonna be so high.

945
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I'm gonna be high on medications.

946
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I'm paying for that backstage box.

947
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Honestly, I'm the feather.

948
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Oh, I'm the father, does a backflip.

949
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Getting the VIP treatment.

950
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Oh yeah.

951
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I wish I could go to the con. I don't know if I can go to the con.

952
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So please do not book any conventions, like for this whole purpose, in case I show up, that's not how it works.

953
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Mummies do weaknesses, travel and mirrors.

954
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I mean, I'll tell it in another stream, but yeah, it's a very unfun story, surrounding the toilet.

955
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
My backyard would love to go next.

956
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
That would be really cute, yeah.

957
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Understood booking all conventions on the slim chance that you show up, yeah.

958
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Oh my gosh, but then, stick an entire brief worth of people in a tumble dryer, and you basically get all the feel.

959
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
If we basically boomed you with five dollars, shall we do it again with another five?

960
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
No, with another six.

961
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Come on, mommy needs to cook.

962
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Like 41 hours away from California.

963
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I think it's in California, I don't know, I actually know where it is.

964
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Six, yeah.

965
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Every jan and vealer, in theory, has six girls, and there should be one design of each that you gravitate towards.

966
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:20,000
That's right, I may not be the smartest, but I know what to do someday, but I like being dumb.

967
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I like reeflings doing all the thinking for me.

968
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
What if you gravitate towards all the designs?

969
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I don't know, I feel like one has to speak to you.

970
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
So you are the oven, I'm just an oven.

971
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I just need you to fill it, let's be dumb together.

972
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You're great, except for the naming part, exactly.

973
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
What do you mean strony 365?

974
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I wonder if I called myself strony 365, because my secret goal was to stream every single day for a year.

975
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:13,000
But, yeah, we're already going to blow that out of the water, unless I'm gravely ill.

976
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Smooth out the brain wrinkles.

977
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
This is something I can get by.

978
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
What if I'm gravitated towards the accent instead?

979
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Then who's out going me?

980
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I like this accent, that's what tickles your pickle.

981
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Oh, then he might need me, I'll tickle that pickle any day, I will.

982
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
What do you mean?

983
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
You will always be my Oshie.

984
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Oh, thank you.

985
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:55,000
See, I'm here because Fiche, who doesn't like Fiche, also impressive Xbox, keep collection.

986
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
What's that?

987
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Yeah, he's been an Xbox kid, oh, so cool.

988
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I used to be one of those kids in the YouTube comments that were like,

989
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Xbox is so much cooler than PlayStation.

990
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Yeah, PlayStation sucks, yeah.

991
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
The accent is good, it's above.

992
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
The accent's funny, it can be sexy when I put it on.

993
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I feel like if I want to do a voice that commands you,

994
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I need to go deeper.

995
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I'm a console warfare, and yeah.

996
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,000
See, I was bursted, and had to be tested from a carpet sale for a fiber.

997
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
PlayStation died.

998
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Yeah, PlayStation drills.

999
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Strangely, I was on the right team for a day one.

1000
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Not beating the comeyoshi allocations.

1001
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
The Scottish accent is sexy, I didn't even know.

1002
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Like my actual accent when I'm monthly.

1003
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I'm like, oh, who's it going lads?

1004
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I'm, yep, this is so as I'm pleased.

1005
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
We better have some backpapes at the convention.

1006
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
No, that's awful.

1007
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I double in 360, but I was a Nintendo kid.

1008
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Nintendo was so expensive.

1009
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
My dad got me a Nintendo DS,

1010
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:33,000
but he was always happier to let me buy like secondhand Xbox 360 games

1011
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
over Nintendo's secondhand, because it was so expensive.

1012
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
We used to have this game shop in the UK called GameStop or Game.

1013
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I think they both went bust, I can't remember.

1014
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And basically, with what?

1015
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
They went bust, but they used to sell secondhand games,

1016
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
and that's how I got all my games.

1017
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
They used to do what was called trade-ins,

1018
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
and I would have to trade in my games to get new ones.

1019
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I think Game Stations bust now.

1020
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Yeah, wasn't it called EB games?

1021
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
No.

1022
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Now in the UK, not that I know of,

1023
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
you aren't wrong though about Nintendo being far too expensive.

1024
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Yes.

1025
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And they just shut down the eNintendo store.

1026
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I think GameStop is still a thing.

1027
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Did you ever go to CEX?

1028
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I don't think so.

1029
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I think most game stores did a version of a trade-in model.

1030
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Yeah, that's how I got my games.

1031
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
It's been Game Station.

1032
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Oh, maybe it's Game Station.

1033
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Study GameStop.

1034
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Maybe Game Station.

1035
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Just remember, I was a weebabi,

1036
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I just looked at the covers of the games and went,

1037
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Dad, I want that one.

1038
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
EB is...

1039
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Wait, what?

1040
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
EB Games was in the UK.

1041
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Oh, yeah, no.

1042
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
If it went bust in 2002, yeah,

1043
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I never experienced EB games.

1044
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I was Xbox for a long time then Switch

1045
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
because the Japanese make some fire games.

1046
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Game is still a thing in the UK.

1047
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
GameStop is still a thing in the US.

1048
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I'll go EB games.

1049
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
We're just EB sleepy gamers.

1050
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I miss choosing games by the cover

1051
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
now I Google them things endlessly.

1052
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Yeah, if you're ever one in a new game

1053
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
to completely time sync

1054
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
and you play PC for mods,

1055
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I recommend the painting of Isaac

1056
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
and I'm not recommending it

1057
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
just so you guys can all princess carry me through the game.

1058
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It's a very big game.

1059
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Big and gay, big and gay.

1060
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Yeah, in the UK,

1061
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
this game now, GameStation,

1062
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
all go, go, go.

1063
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
EB Games was absorbed by GameStop.

1064
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Oh my god, we're getting the lore.

1065
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
We're getting the capitalism lore.

1066
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Ooh, yeah, painting of Isaac.

1067
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Yeah.

1068
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
The painting of Isaac doesn't work anymore

1069
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
in your PC, huh?

1070
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah, I had an Xbox, just an Xbox.

1071
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Oh, the Xbox original.

1072
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I wanted to get my 360,

1073
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
but I think it's messed up.

1074
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
It's the latest console I own by a country male.

1075
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Here's a more hands-down based story.

1076
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I'm sure I've just misread that,

1077
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
but you actually made cameo.

1078
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Yeah, it's like fantasy game.

1079
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
It's really nice.

1080
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
If you're talking about Xbox exclusives,

1081
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
if you're talking about overall,

1082
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
yeah, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

1083
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
yeah, sorry, you've just miss,

1084
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
you've just misspelled Assassin's Creed,

1085
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
it's fine, you spell it as, as in,

1086
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
creed, yeah, no, it's fine,

1087
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
you've just misspelled, don't worry about it.

1088
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I can read through your head missing.

1089
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Any fellow guitar hero enjoyers?

1090
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I wish Army of Two was multiplayer,

1091
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
but no, I don't think.

1092
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I would love to do Army of Two.

1093
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Oh, did you ever have a Game Boy?

1094
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I did, and I had like three Game Boy games.

1095
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:06,000
My dad, so if my dad bought the console,

1096
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
he would let me play it basically,

1097
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
and he bought a Game Boy,

1098
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and he didn't like it, so he gave it to me.

1099
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
And I've played Pokémon Ribby,

1100
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I've played Legend of Zelda Minish Cap,

1101
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
and one more game.

1102
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I'm sure there's one more game I probably played.

1103
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
The Minish Cap is my only Zelda game.

1104
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Oh, my voice is breaking.

1105
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Legend of Zelda Minish Cap.

1106
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Oh, sorry.

1107
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Oh, no, wait, no, sorry, tapping ASMR.

1108
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Little, little tappies.

1109
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Doesn't actually sound that nice.

1110
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I don't know what 33 Immortals is.

1111
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I haven't heard about it, have we?

1112
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
What's your favorite Pokémon?

1113
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
And why is it Shantler?

1114
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I actually didn't mean Lewek.

1115
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Lewek is so cute,

1116
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
but see, Pokémon have this thing

1117
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000
where they make a really cute, adorable, creepy Pokémon,

1118
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
and then its evolution is Oakland.

1119
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I don't even want ugly, ugly evolutions.

1120
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Lewek is adorable, it's an MMO.

1121
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I don't know, we're knee-deep in RuneScape right now.

1122
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I took the console with me everywhere.

1123
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It'd be the crap out of the paint's worn out,

1124
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
but it still works.

1125
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Old school games, I don't see.

1126
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Literally think of, what is it, Joystick Drift?

1127
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
No, that's not a gender name.

1128
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It's a Joy-Con Drift.

1129
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Oh, that's a Joy-Con Drift on Nintendo Switch,

1130
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
but Game Boy Advance's that were made

1131
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
how many years back still work.

1132
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I'm catching up on Old School RuneScape vision now.

1133
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Did y'all know there was a Pokémon card game on Game Boy?

1134
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Nope.

1135
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It's in the up-gaming.

1136
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Sorry, my voice is cracking.

1137
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Hello, I've got 25 minutes,

1138
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
and then I'm going on official vocal rest,

1139
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
and we are reading into Shibi playing.

1140
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
If you didn't know, Cult of the Lamb is a 10 out of 10 game.

1141
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I rate it very highly.

1142
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I had a Game Boy card game, it was so fun.

1143
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Courtney was all, it was Courtney.

1144
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
The Game Boy card game was actually really good.

1145
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Sorry, you can't go back to sleep, me as well, cook something.

1146
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Oh, very good.

1147
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And Jack and Kenabiana.

1148
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Ah!

1149
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Ah, yo.

1150
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Cult of the Lamb isn't your first update.

1151
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Cult of the Lamb's multiplayer,

1152
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
so I'm going to force Shibi to play it with me.

1153
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I still have my Pokémon card game on Game Boy.

1154
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Yeah, I'm going to go to work, see you next dream.

1155
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Yeah, I'm ending.

1156
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:20,000
We're going to redirect into Shibi in 20 minutes, okay?

1157
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
You should play with us as cultists, then starting.

1158
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I don't know how the multiplayer works,

1159
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
but we'll see.

1160
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Cult of the Lamb is Twitch integration.

1161
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I don't know if YouTube wants to do that kind of in-game integration or not.

1162
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Damn, it feels like the stream just started.

1163
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I mean, in terms of insurance, yeah.

1164
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Have you ever played War Thunder?

1165
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
No, it's how we...

1166
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
It's local co-op, I could have sworn.

1167
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
As all they said, I had multiplayer, am I going crazy?

1168
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
What are you doing after stream?

1169
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I'm going to make a cup of tea to soothe my throat,

1170
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
and then I'm going to message clippers

1171
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
and check any clips that the girls might have had.

1172
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And then I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.

1173
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I can't believe I'm saying that, but yes, I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.

1174
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:28,000
And then I'm going to edit some ASMRs in preparation of getting monetized,

1175
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
so I can upload those 1K special videos,

1176
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:38,000
and I will probably write the script for the pregnant with you ASMR

1177
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,000
that I want to make, and I'll most likely contact an artist as well about it.

1178
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
But yeah, quite a few things I need to catch up on,

1179
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
especially with the insurance streams.

1180
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I'll probably be listening to Shibi in the background as she plays.

1181
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
So whoever said War Thunder, you only play that game if you hate yourself.

1182
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
But yes, I have a big day, big day.

1183
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I don't know if I should show a picture of my feet and hands afterwards,

1184
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:20,000
because some people don't like streamers that do hand cam or whatever.

1185
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I'm very sorry if, you know, get filler, get filler, get filler.

1186
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,000
But yeah, literally tomorrow you get to see my hands.

1187
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Wow, whilst I eat the American candy, wow.

1188
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I get to try A&W visages.

1189
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It's like a cream and soda, it's said, but I don't normally drink cream and soda.

1190
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
And what other? I think there is Twizzlers.

1191
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,000
There is like Spacey Hot Cheetos or something, or Takis.

1192
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I get to try Takis, the scrawny grippers.

1193
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Wait, do you want me to put the feet in the stream as well?

1194
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I mean, I can do it.

1195
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I can put my feet in the stream if you want.

1196
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Okay.

1197
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
You wish as my command.

1198
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
You guys don't understand, like, you might be used to streamers out here

1199
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
that don't do what you want.

1200
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You do not understand.

1201
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I will do what you want.

1202
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Send me what you want.

1203
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Let me know.

1204
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Like, as much as I am in command of you, you are in command of me.

1205
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I will think of a humorous way to incorporate my feet into moral stream, okay?

1206
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
College kid names.

1207
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
My little baby replaying.

1208
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
We need the scrawny thighs.

1209
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Can I put thighs? I don't know.

1210
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I've not decided on my outfit.

1211
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I think I'm just wearing fishnets, I'm sorry.

1212
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I can't believe I actually have to put clothes on for a vacant stream.

1213
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
You guys are terrible.

1214
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Please, let me put on my smile.

1215
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Right, I'm just going to check Marshmallow.

1216
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Just because we're actually getting really close to the end.

1217
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Oh, that's a lot of Marshmallows.

1218
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Oh my.

1219
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
That was a lot more than yesterday.

1220
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
What's mommy going to do?

1221
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Mommy's going to do whatever she wants to.

1222
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Oh, sorry.

1223
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I love your hypnosis.

1224
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I get happy every time I go under someone else's influence.

1225
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I'm so glad I did so well during that section.

1226
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1227
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Hey.

1228
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Yeah, sorry.

1229
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I'm reading Marshmallows, but pretty much none of them can be said on stream.

1230
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Yippee.

1231
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
This is the part where I'm supposed to be like a business person.

1232
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I'm supposed to be like, oh, but what does my ghost do it?

1233
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Are you a bit of a meat and then as far as wishing marks?

1234
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I mean, I could try and do hypnosis again, but it's probably not going to be that good.

1235
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I need to be in the zone to corrupt you, but because I've been allowed to meme, I feel like myself.

1236
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And I'm just some goofy dork, like honestly.

1237
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Business strongy, yapper strongy, professional strongy.

1238
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I wear so many hats.

1239
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Why is animus showing us a strange cold?

1240
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Not enough time.

1241
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Your error, goofy dork.

1242
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yay, communist hole.

1243
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I've already prayed in obedience.

1244
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Jokes on you, how many of them?

1245
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Uh...

1246
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Hey strongy, after a year of waiting, you've really surprised me.

1247
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Well, I'm just...

1248
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I have been afraid to die for a while and decided I'd support your project regardless of the quality,

1249
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
but the girls are great and the content is stellar, I'm glad.

1250
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I usually just work at lurk and watch streams, but I felt like I had to tell you.

1251
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I love mommy and I love when she's... and I love what she's done with the place.

1252
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I love you too, little refling.

1253
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I'm so glad you love the girls as well.

1254
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I was really worried that, like, you guys would think, like, go support them, you know?

1255
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Cause I'm not.

1256
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:20,000
She said she wasn't in a hidden program and I hope you're having as much as a good time as the reflings are,

1257
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
and in any case, thank you.

1258
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Oh, I'm having a good time.

1259
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
The only reason I ain't doing insurance...

1260
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
That's my voice and this is how I talk.

1261
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I'm a little broken, but I can bypass that by whispering at the moment.

1262
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
That's the reason why I'm not doing an insurance stream today or tomorrow.

1263
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But don't worry, you can fix me.

1264
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I just need some of your ink, okay?

1265
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So send me your ink and marshmallow right now.

1266
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Wait, we got a tip. I need to read it.

1267
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Let me read it.

1268
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Airwind player, thank you for the tip blown away today.

1269
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Thank you so much for the hypnosis.

1270
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Look forward to what's to come.

1271
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1272
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Really amazed at how good this is going.

1273
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Much love.

1274
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Thank you.

1275
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Don't strain your voice by whispering too much.

1276
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,000
It's really weird because I broke...

1277
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,000
So my voice is broken and whispering breaks your voice further,

1278
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
but I can bypass my voice right now by whispering.

1279
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
It's crazy.

1280
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I don't know how it works.

1281
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
We whisper.

1282
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Yes.

1283
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Very inkable.

1284
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,000
The urge to use my tongue right now is very high,

1285
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
but I shan't.

1286
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I won't refrain from such sins.

1287
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I won't refrain, okay?

1288
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Getting, getting, getting incredible.

1289
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
But yeah, I'll go on vocal rest for today

1290
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
because I don't have to record anything

1291
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
and I need to send collab partner scripts.

1292
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Wow.

1293
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
SlySaber, thank you for the tip.

1294
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
It says, thanks for the ASMR.

1295
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Here's your inking.

1296
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
My voice is so broken.

1297
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
TinySpany, thank you for the tip.

1298
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I just got some iron prayer delivered shop.

1299
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
So I'll try score soda for the first time tomorrow on stream

1300
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
when you try chord stuff.

1301
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Yay, let's go.

1302
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I have iron brew too.

1303
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Actually, I'll drink iron brew with you.

1304
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Oh, you made me ink.

1305
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Like, it's supposed to be good for the throat, okay?

1306
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I'm so professional, okay?

1307
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
But yeah, I will definitely take a really good look at marshmallows shortly.

1308
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
A lot of them cannot be said.

1309
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Mayhaps in membership streams.

1310
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
You never know.

1311
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Nine out of ten doctors recommend, oh yeah, our refling doctors.

1312
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Good for the throat, sure.

1313
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I mean, want to find out.

1314
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
This is terrible.

1315
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Don't you want to help me?

1316
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Help me feel better.

1317
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Come on.

1318
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,000
If you can do something to help me, I'll be good, okay?

1319
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
But you need to be good in return.

1320
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Be good for me.

1321
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Give me what I need.

1322
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Give me what I need.

1323
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
That's terrible.

1324
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Okay, no going under.

1325
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
No going under.

1326
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Stop.

1327
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It's just me.

1328
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I'm still memeing, okay?

1329
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I'm still memeing.

1330
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Not a doctor, but three years into a doctorate.

1331
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
If mummy asks refling's answer,

1332
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
what, another tip?

1333
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Everyone player, thank you for the tip.

1334
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Yeah, it helps, Johnny.

1335
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I don't know why sometimes the message displays

1336
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
and then it doesn't display.

1337
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
It's been so silly.

1338
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Can you make your background go a bit faster?

1339
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Right now, I don't think so.

1340
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
But I do have alternate dingy mobobbers.

1341
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Oh wait, here we go.

1342
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Are you ready?

1343
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Wait.

1344
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Yeah.

1345
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I can do like this.

1346
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It's going so fast.

1347
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Do we need to slow down or do we need to speed up?

1348
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
That's terrible, isn't it?

1349
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Just terrible.

1350
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
But that's as fast as I can make it.

1351
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
So hopefully that's faster now.

1352
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Speed up or slow down?

1353
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Yeah.

1354
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

1355
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Okay.

1356
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
That should be the correct settings.

1357
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I think.

1358
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Trucks on you are always under.

1359
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Yeah, I get to set the pace.

1360
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Just don't make it too fast.

1361
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Don't want anyone out here.

1362
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Let's see.

1363
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Nero, thank you for the tip.

1364
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
It says all my ink blocks to you, Johnny.

1365
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
You just need to ask,

1366
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
have I broken you already?

1367
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Yeah?

1368
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Am I alleged to break you?

1369
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Have I still got the effect on my voice,

1370
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
or is it normal again?

1371
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Wait, what?

1372
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
What?

1373
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
What?

1374
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
My pupils are broken.

1375
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
It's normal.

1376
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Okay, you broke us a long time ago.

1377
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Can't break what's already broken.

1378
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I see a few of you are already broken in for me.

1379
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
You broke me at a low.

1380
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Your hair looks like the famous spiral candy.

1381
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I forgot his name.

1382
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I don't know what it is.

1383
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
My seashells, or my hair.

1384
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I'm going to be honest, I wouldn't take much.

1385
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
It's over.

1386
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Over.

1387
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
That's cheating, Johnny.

1388
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Look, I will get my way.

1389
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I said unending stamina.

1390
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I meant it.

1391
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
He broke me at the one.

1392
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
It's too far.

1393
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Your voice is so entrancing.

1394
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Yeah, when it's not broken.

1395
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Hopefully, I will do better soon.

1396
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
And I can have much more.

1397
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Ismar.

1398
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I am folding like a towel.

1399
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
No, it's not a spring mill.

1400
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Unending stamina gives me every day.

1401
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Yeah, it does.

1402
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
It should.

1403
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Should I do vocal requests

1404
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
for the rest of the stream?

1405
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
And you guys take what you want me to do.

1406
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
It's to solve it for myself.

1407
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I did that under a surface ASMR.

1408
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
There's only so much better I can draw.

1409
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I'm just skull-brained, okay?

1410
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I'm just a bit skull-brained.

1411
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I've already folded and put up in the linen closet

1412
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
ready for use.

1413
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
You want shh.

1414
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Shhh.

1415
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
You're asking for all you want me

1416
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
10 to 0.

1417
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
We've only got 8 minutes left.

1418
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
8 minutes.

1419
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I don't even know if I'm allowed to do your kissing.

1420
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
My dummy's making a noise.

1421
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Can you hypnotize us to be good dogs for Shabby's stream?

1422
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
I would love to do that.

1423
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Can we do that?

1424
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Can we do that?

1425
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Can we please do that?

1426
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Can we please do that?

1427
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Please let me hypnotize you to be a dog for Shabby.

1428
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Please, please, please, please, please.

1429
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1430
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Let me set up for this.

1431
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I'm so serious.

1432
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I need to set up for this.

1433
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Hold on, let me drink some water as well.

1434
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I'm so serious.

1435
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Or I am so serious.

1436
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Okay.

1437
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Let me just decrymify myself

1438
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
because we're going serious mode.

1439
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Wait, I'll do one last calibration

1440
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
because this iPhone is killing me.

1441
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Okay.

1442
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Okay.

1443
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Okay.

1444
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Let's get to work.

1445
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Oh no, that's not it.

1446
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Oopsies, played the wrong one.

1447
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
There, there.

1448
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
I'm not the only one

1449
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
that can look after you this way.

1450
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
In fact,

1451
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I have five more

1452
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
that I refer to

1453
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
as my daughters.

1454
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
There is one

1455
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
who will join you soon.

1456
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
She will look after you.

1457
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
But there's a catch.

1458
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
What a refling.

1459
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
You need to be well-behaved.

1460
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Okay.

1461
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Almost like a dog.

1462
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
You know how to be a good dog, don't you?

1463
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
You need to be malleable.

1464
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Follow commands.

1465
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Be told what to do,

1466
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
what to say,

1467
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
what to think.

1468
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
You are nothing

1469
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
but a pup

1470
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
for her amusement.

1471
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
And in the end,

1472
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
you are nothing but a pup.

1473
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
And in turn,

1474
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
you will amuse me.

1475
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
So be good.

1476
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Don't worry.

1477
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
It'll wear off soon.

1478
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
After her stream.

1479
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
But for now,

1480
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
good pup speak.

1481
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
And they go park.

1482
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Don't they?

1483
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Yeah.

1484
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And then,

1485
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
they wait

1486
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
on the command

1487
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
of their owner.

1488
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
You are orange.

1489
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Do you understand?

1490
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
You do not have

1491
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
free will.

1492
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
You're a mutt

1493
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
ready

1494
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
to do the bidding

1495
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
of your owner.

1496
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
So let her have fun,

1497
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
okay?

1498
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And in turn,

1499
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I will have fun

1500
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
and you

1501
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
will have

1502
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
fun.

1503
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
So don't think

1504
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
not until you're told otherwise.

1505
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Because in three minutes,

1506
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I'm going to hand

1507
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
the imaginary leash

1508
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
over

1509
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
to your owner.

1510
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Your new owner.

1511
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Don't worry.

1512
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
It's temporary.

1513
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
But you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1514
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Get to play with a new owner for a while.

1515
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Good pup.

1516
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
You deserve some head pads, don't you?

1517
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Oh, you're a good boy.

1518
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Such a good boy.

1519
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
And it feels so rewarding

1520
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
to hear praise, doesn't it?

1521
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
In two minutes,

1522
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
you get your new owner,

1523
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
just temporary,

1524
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
for a little while.

1525
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
And she'll give you all

1526
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
the attention you need,

1527
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
all the love.

1528
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
And I'll reward you

1529
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
extra

1530
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
when you come back to me, okay?

1531
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
So you'll be good, won't you?

1532
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Little pup.

1533
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I've taught you well.

1534
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
You know how to behave.

1535
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
So be good.

1536
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
In one minute,

1537
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
your new owner

1538
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
will take your leash

1539
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
and build you along with her.

1540
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Okay?

1541
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Good little pup.

1542
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Such a good,

1543
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
good boy.

1544
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Oh,

1545
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I hear her.

1546
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
She's coming.

1547
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I hope you're ready.

1548
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Zero.

1549
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Good talk.
