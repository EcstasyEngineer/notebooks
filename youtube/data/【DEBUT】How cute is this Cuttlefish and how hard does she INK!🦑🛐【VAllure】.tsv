0	28320	Daniel
328320	358160	Growing up in the open seas,
358160	365760	there are stories told of the monsters that lurked below, deadly leviathans, monstrous serpents,
366640	372080	yet no giant could hope to match the lethal efficiency of one such creature,
372800	383040	equal in elegance incarnate, so alluring yet so deadly, so hypnotically fatal as the siren,
383040	391360	the succubi of the sea, the witch of the waves, the black widows of the, uh, black sea,
392160	398720	a maiden with a hypnotic gaze that warped the wills of even the most salt-seasoned captains,
398720	402960	and a song that commanded the crews of even the most loyal sailors.
403600	409920	My mother would read me these tales before bed, tales of aquatic femme fatales that lured men to
409920	417680	sail themselves to their blood-soaked watery graves. These horrific tales of nautical nefariousness
417680	427120	would keep me up at night. They made me feel so, so inspired. I mean, my people used to do that?
427120	433520	That's so cool. I mean, I've never fed on a human before, and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized
433520	440480	is a seal. But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.
440480	446400	I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill, fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.
447280	456000	Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were. My ocean, my home, humans
456080	463120	defile it with their presence. Worse still, they toss their filth into it, further insulting us.
463840	468160	How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past?
468160	472320	They used to tell legends on every port that made even the most straight-laced,
472320	478000	superstitious scoffing marines keep in the back of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads
478000	483280	of their ships in respect to our beautiful, yet delicate bodies. They put us on every map.
483840	492880	But now? Ugh, disgusting humans. One night, I envisioned a genius plan. The first strike
492880	499680	microseed against the human world. I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel,
499680	505200	and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of hypnotized thralls. I was going to wage a
505200	512160	one siren war against all of humanity. It was going to be perfect, and I definitely would have won.
512960	519680	That was, until I envisioned a plan that was even more perfect. Er, well, at least more time
519680	528080	efficient. Making my way below deck, I made a strange discovery. The humans were hypnotized
528080	534560	by their own choice. I couldn't believe it. I looked at boat after boat. These humans
535440	541680	charmed like a siren spell, even dedicating their lives to their chosen idols. These
541760	548800	idols they fawn over. Were they sirens too? That's it. That's the secret to defeating the
548800	554240	humans. I'm going to find the secret to their magic, and harness this power myself and bring
554240	560480	power back to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything and everything to
560480	566960	grow my influence over mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people. But I'm not
567040	571440	just going to tip the scales. I'm going for complete domination.
573200	579200	Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering for their own demise. I will be the
579200	585200	instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and praise my name as I bring about their
585200	591440	end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean, and my people will chant my name
591440	602400	as they have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend. Though that's a very long-term goal.
603520	610320	With every big venture, whether business-wise or lifestyle, every big undertaking starts small
610320	623280	scale, right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.
634400	638080	You wanted a ferro kusugaki? I gave you a ferro kusugaki.
641120	644320	You wanted a doting hag? I gave you a doting hag.
647680	651120	You wanted a dorky yandere? I gave you a dorky yandere.
654880	658960	You wanted a masochistic brocon? I gave you a masochistic brocon.
661680	665680	You wanted a milk dominatrix? I gave you a milk dominatrix.
665680	678240	And now, I bring you the vichu bird that no one asked for, a god damn hypnotic cuttlefish.
696320	706080	No copyright. No copyright. No copyright intended, bros. Come on, come on, come on. Relax, relax.
707760	714880	Did I kick or did I fucking kick, ladies and gentlemen?
716400	719440	Have you enjoyed your evening so far?
719920	723520	Hmm. Have you been warmed up by my girls?
723520	730480	Who stole your heart the most? Was it A.C., the ferral polar bear, or was it Azura,
730480	737600	the literal definition of mommy milkers? Or whatever. Merci. The yandere that can never
737600	742080	love right? I mean, she's got plenty of love to give. Doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna be
742080	746960	alive at the end of it, okay? But hey ho, you know, you still get love done at the end of the day.
746960	752880	Or was it Emmy, the most controversially created character of all time? But hey ho,
752880	756240	look, we're just gonna skip past that. You know, if you ignore the lore or everything else,
756240	761600	that's fang, it's fang, it's fang. Stop worrying, you guys are such blurry warts, honestly.
761600	768240	Or was it Madame Sheevee herself, a little brothel owner? Because, you know, gonna be honest,
768240	774080	didn't really get many requests for a hypnotic cuttlefish, that's Scottish. But hey ho, hey ho,
774480	776720	that's how it goes, that's how it goes, that's how it goes, that's how it goes, that's how it goes.
776720	782480	There's what made me, let's, let me, let me formally and reduce massing. What do I need?
782480	790960	Look at these slays, they're so pretty, they're so pretty, okay? I, ladies and gentlemen, I'm
790960	797280	Strony Cuttles. Please, Cuttles, the surname is because I'm a Cuttlefish. Oh, shocker,
797920	807440	and Strony because I am Strony, the daughter of the gamer Strontyum. My dad's gamer tag is Stronyum.
807440	811760	No, it's not actually Stronyum before you're like, oh my god, you just dox your dad, no, relax,
811760	816880	it's not actually literally really, you know, Stronyum, but I'm, I'm Strony, Cuttles, I'm named
816880	821360	after my dad, my dad's gamer, and I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from
821360	827440	his ballsack. Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen, oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber
827440	832480	challenge of tell us your age. It's not really looking good, okay, it's not looking good.
834640	842400	Cuttlefish normally live two years, so time's ticking, time is ticking. Anyway, my birthday is
842400	849360	October 10th, which is actually National Squid and Cuttlefish Day, they're both set for the pod,
849360	854160	so I don't mind sharing that birthday with the Squid VTubers if there's any of these out there.
854880	862000	My height is 162 centimetres, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update this slide,
862000	870400	like a dafty, but hey, over here now. For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland,
871200	876720	the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language, so in your face,
877280	884880	I can speak two languages, so it's fantastic with that. And Grace, I am a Cuttlefish,
884880	888000	and I'm also good at the 100m sprint, thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week.
890640	898000	My legs and disc legs, I like mesmerising you, that part comes later, okay, very soon,
898000	902240	the debut is only 30 minutes long, you can go away long with us, okay, you know, really boom, boom,
902320	907760	really quick over here. ASMR, if you like ASMR, you're gonna get spoiled, rotten on my channel,
907760	914640	or any of the ViaLoreGirls' channels, show us your plasters, no, oh god, can you see it,
914640	920320	wait, you're not supposed to see that part, yeah, like, I have to censor myself, my design's a little
920320	925920	sussable, okay, okay, anyway, what was I saying, ASMR, if you like ASMR, me and my gen mates are
925920	932080	all literally ASMR'd out the wazoo, so don't be shy to like or subscribe on any of them,
934480	939120	can't help give you a bigger hint than that, but hey ho, I like seeing victory on my screen,
939120	944800	because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin possible, and you know, you get it from playing
944800	949920	multiplayer games, and you're in the same boat as me, and I also like plasters and band-aids,
950880	960320	my wonder one, for no nefarious reason, for my dislikes, grrr, you know, hate is a strong word
960320	965520	for my dislikes instead, grrr, I don't like bullies in video games, your teammates aren't
965520	970800	often a magically beat MLG pro, so relax, you don't have fun, it's a multiplayer game, team game,
971440	977040	just enjoy yourselves, okay, I don't like serious people, I don't like seriousness, I think my gen
977040	988800	mates can all pretty much vouch that I am the most unserious and ridiculous, I can't be serious,
988800	992480	it's terrible, I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire
992480	999360	life, but hey ho, that's like, and I don't like Mongolian throat singing, I'm so sorry,
1000080	1009200	people seem to really like it, but I don't, it doesn't sound nice, so I apologize to the one
1009200	1018400	Mongolian throat singer that's watching right now, but I just can't, okay, I'm nice and generic, sorry
1018400	1023440	there's nothing interesting about my tastes, movies, lord of the rings, best as we come,
1024320	1029440	animes, nice and generic again, books, I actually started reading books this year, I know that
1029440	1035440	sounds crazy as a sin because people like read books in general, me however, I started this year,
1035440	1041520	I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads,
1041520	1045200	for some reason they just really capture me, I like being depressed after reading a book,
1046640	1052640	for my music Hatsune Miku and Atarashi Gaku, I want to see them live if it's possible, but
1053440	1062720	yeah, sorry it's like choking my spit, oh yeah, just a wee bit of a gamer, a tiny bit of a gamer,
1062720	1067200	like it doesn't mean I'm good at games, now before there's that one person that's like,
1067200	1073680	you've played all these games, that means you're MLG pro, not relax, relax, I've played games full
1073680	1079360	stop, okay, these are the games that I remember playing or just kind of like have a good, yeah
1079360	1084800	played them type thing, okay, so you might have a few things in common, I could, you know,
1084800	1089760	move out of the way, there's like some Lego games, I still love my Lego games, but yeah,
1089760	1093520	these are all the games that I remember playing, there's tons that I've obviously missed out on
1093520	1097600	that are like so tiny that it's kind of hard to mention, but there's a big ol' square red for you,
1097600	1102080	as we see it was about an Xbox gamer, do apologize, the old Call of Duty days,
1102720	1108800	yeah, for my goals, um, I want to get monetized on YouTube,
1111040	1115600	so feel free to subscribe, because we have been called like crazy since then,
1118560	1123600	and we need watch hours, so don't be shy to rewatch anything that is offered on the channel,
1124880	1131280	I want to stream so much that you can basically read everything in my voice, and you know,
1131280	1136480	you'll be Scots yourself, and you can apply for citizenship, and all that good stuff,
1138000	1143760	I also want to create a mega ASMR collab with my gen mates, which I've already got quite a few
1143760	1150480	on the way, so don't worry, it's coming, you just gotta wait, okay, um, I have a childhood dream,
1150480	1156240	actually, of a 100,000 gamer score, and it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass,
1156240	1164000	I would absolutely love to explore a taken amount of, um, childhood games, and I would love to play
1164000	1168560	like your childhood games as well, because obviously I was kind of at the mercy of what
1168560	1175680	my dad would buy me for childhood games, so it doesn't quite count, um, so here's a little fun
1175680	1183600	factoid about me, I'm a wee bit of a workaholic, so I would like to say that for every 1000 subscribers
1183600	1189120	I get on my YouTube channel, I'm going to upload a celebratory, really hard to say that if you're
1189120	1195760	Scottish, celebratory ASMR video, pair 1000 subscribers, I've already got like tons
1196720	1205920	ready to go, so don't be shy, you know what to do, wink, wink, I also want to challenge myself,
1206640	1213520	I want to collab, I want to make ASMR collabs with over 100 different VTubers, and I'm actually
1213520	1218640	so much of a workaholic, I already have three confirmed with VTubers outside of VLR, so
1220960	1226480	I'm very serious about that, if you ever have a 3DO, you're a VTuber, I'm coming to find you in
1226480	1233200	your DMs, um, I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together, I think it would be so fun,
1233200	1238400	I'm not a very strong reader, but I think it would be really cute to do like a little, um,
1239120	1245760	like before the end of stream, we read one chapter or something like that, and last but certainly
1245760	1251600	not least, I would love to get stream sniped, I absolutely adore it, I love playing multiplayer
1251600	1256560	games where you can join me and you can have an amazing time and have so much fun, it's just one
1256560	1261680	of my favourite things okay, so please do not be shy, every week I plan on playing multiplayer
1261680	1265520	games where you can join me at any point, I will try to make them free and accessible as I can,
1266320	1267760	these are my goals, thank you, thank you, thank you,
1269920	1274880	I'm dumb, okay, I'm really dumb, I don't know how to come up with tags, I'm not funny, I'm not good
1274880	1283200	with puns, so I am more than happy to take any suggestion, um, we can figure it out very soon,
1283200	1290960	don't worry, okay, my Oshi marks are squid, but I'm a cuttlefish, but squids and cuttlefish are
1290960	1297040	cephalopod, so I don't mind sharing the emoji, and then the second emoji kind of looks like a man
1297040	1303760	bowing, hmm, hmm, maybe that is a hint to what I might try to make content wise,
1305360	1313120	and for fan names, there is only gonna be one option, come on, let's not beat around the bush,
1313120	1321040	you are my refling, you will always be my refling, and thank you so fucking much for waiting, I have
1321040	1331040	bloody missed you, special shout out to Nari, and Squishy Goal, you may have noticed a bit of a
1331040	1338640	trending pattern, alright, a bit of a trending pattern, uh, Squishy Goal, conceptualized as all,
1339360	1345520	and Nari helped out and made us come to life, which is beautiful, beautiful, and also as a little
1345520	1351600	mini announcement, the Vealor website, the official Vealor website will be updated shortly, and everyone
1351600	1357760	who created the gen one at any, any stage is gonna be credited on the website, so you'll see these
1357760	1362160	names very soon on that website once the update comes out, so thank you everyone who came together
1362160	1372880	to meet this fantastic gen of indulge, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, no, no, most people get to do, oh,
1372880	1381040	this is my gen mate's impression, okay, gen mate's impression, me, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
1381040	1388720	I picked my gen mates, do you understand, I picked them, okay, now I'm gonna tell you why I picked them,
1388800	1395600	you ready for this? Mercy's determination, she was gonna make it no matter what,
1396400	1402000	a little determining, like, the definition of mercy in the dictionary, if you look up,
1402000	1406880	it just says determined, okay, there is no way in heck she was not gonna get in, that's all I'm
1406960	1419440	gonna say on that one, and then Emi, I'm gonna have to be, Emi said to someone who was being
1419440	1424400	rude to her to keep themselves safe in Minecraft, and then she instantly got the part, okay,
1426960	1434640	I say, I say, oh, I say, has fantastic experience in history, and she's such a hard worker, she,
1434720	1440960	she gives her best, okay, she gives everything 100%, and it was absolutely beautiful, and she
1440960	1448720	actually, she had the most, um, she had the most professional application, even though English
1448720	1452800	is in her first language, and I'm like, god damn, I see, you're fucking impressive,
1454480	1461200	um, then Azura, okay, I describe Azura as my little diamond in the rough, now hear me out
1461200	1465680	before you're like, isn't that an insult, relax, I'm not told the full story yet, my goodness,
1465680	1473760	you're jumping the gun, I was going to cross off Azura's stream as I was reviewing her,
1473760	1478080	because she wasn't talking, she wasn't interacting, she wasn't really doing anything,
1478640	1488640	and then she said three words in that voice, oh, Azura, she instantly became Azura, she said
1488640	1493840	three words, and she got the damn part, and she was like, in that voice, in that, I can't mimic
1493840	1504800	her voice, okay, but I need gold, oh, Rosyksu, Rosyksu, and Shivi, Shivi is everything I should
1504800	1511280	have been in another life, okay, she is going very far, I'm very happy, absolutely, I could not have
1511280	1517840	asked for better gen mates, I am blown away that these girls even have freaking applied to such a
1517920	1524240	crazy idea, and here we are, debut, and you guys have shown nothing but love and support,
1524240	1530160	and we are all so thankful, I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like, holy fuck, thank you,
1531280	1534880	because we didn't expect any of this, we're just like, yeah, we're just going to be my butt,
1537040	1544880	Ray, let me take you to, is that it, oh, I forgot to put away, it's for decoration,
1544880	1552320	okay, the tentacle in the back is for decoration, no questions, okay, no questions, let me do the
1552320	1561440	full body, let's start with the full body, may have a bandaid on for reasons, but as you can see,
1561440	1567920	I got some swivelly hips, thank you, no hurry, you know, we'll start from the bottom,
1567920	1572560	start from the bottom, never hear, you know how it is, okay, so if you didn't know, I actually
1572560	1579920	have what's known as a French manicure and pedicure, so you can see my little toenails,
1579920	1587120	this is French manicure, pedicure, and then you go up my face, and don't even be careful at my
1587120	1593120	thighs, because with a bandaid, is this smart, is this white, okay, okay, I don't think that's white,
1593120	1601920	okay, check it out, see look, I've got, oh my voice, I've got a French pedicure, manicure, see,
1602000	1607760	okay, we're just gonna skip past the bottom part, okay, and as you can see, if you look really close
1607760	1615200	to the elbows, I have pearlescent to my outfit, my outfit isn't white, it's pearlescent, so I shimmer
1615200	1620480	as I move about, it's fantastic, and so does my seashells, that's the top two, if you look at
1620480	1628480	real close, you have to really look for it, but look, I'm a shiny little seashell, what do you think,
1628480	1635920	it's good though, yeah, I'm in the Yukata, because it's a homage to Japanese culture,
1635920	1640960	because without Japanese culture, let's be honest, maybe, maybe trippers would be here, so
1642080	1648080	you know, the little Yukata going on, okay, let me, let me get real close, hopefully this isn't
1648080	1653360	uncomfortable, I know some people aren't like the best with eye contact, but look, don't, it's me,
1653360	1665040	it's me, okay, I'm a freak, I'm a star, I'm a star, and like, if I open my eyes, it opens,
1667600	1674960	I love you so much, oh and I'm sad, I'm sad, please, better not upset me, go subscribe to my
1675920	1681120	you upset me, I put pupil restructuring, what did you say,
1684640	1690640	I'm unamused, you failed me, I don't know, I can't do it, I can't do it the way she
1690640	1697280	does it, she's just off the top of her head, I'm like, these are my heart eyes, I love them,
1697280	1701520	and like, okay, this is just my opinion, but do you see how my neck is doing that thing,
1701520	1708560	where like, in the chin area, and it disappears, I love it so much in each of her models when
1708560	1716640	they do it, it's just, I love it, I love it, I love it, you're trying to make me blush,
1717600	1726560	you ever seen a blushing cut before? Oh, actually this is a very good point, some people don't like
1727520	1734400	backseat gaming, oh, I'm the opposite, I'm very dumb, I'm very happy for you a backseat game,
1734400	1738080	so you're probably going to see this one a lot if you care to watch me at any point,
1740640	1745600	and I got, oh I was kind of, look at that stuff there, how deep that went though, I was like,
1745600	1750960	swear, you know, looking at my gen mates all day, like, come on, the designs are good, don't lie,
1751920	1759200	oh, I might have just kind of spoiled it there, but you know how to cut fish,
1759200	1764080	have hypnotic patterns, may I please do this for you, are you ready?
1769840	1774080	Yes, we're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR, I love it,
1774720	1781440	you wouldn't fall for my hypnotic capabilities,
1784480	1789840	but if you're really struggling, like, if you're really struggling, how about this?
1790160	1807440	Yeah, it's over for you, just admit it, it's over for you, I mean, how can you resist,
1807520	1815600	why can't you resist this little Scottish accent? Right, right, right, attend, schedule time,
1817680	1825760	so my gen mates are all doing debut 2.0s, which is fantastic, me on the other hand,
1825760	1833920	I'm exposing the damn company, I've had enough of VLR, I'm exposing every little dirty secret they
1833920	1840240	have, so if you're excited to know the ins and outs of what it's like to run a VTuber agency,
1840240	1845280	to create one, to fund one, to know what goes on behind the scenes, that's right,
1846080	1854080	you can show up to my stream, the motor, obviously, I'm playing the greatest game of all time in
1854080	1862000	my first week, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, I will not be taking any statements, any questions,
1862000	1867040	and any threats about claiming that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is not the greatest game of all
1867040	1874240	time, so sorry, not sorry, but yeah, we also have needy streamer overload, James Cameron's Avatar,
1874240	1878400	which is such a niche game, I think about two people who are watching this right now, probably
1878400	1883440	played it, the multiplayer game of the week is Old School Runescape, if you'd like to do some
1883440	1891680	questing with me, I'm also doing an ASMR stream, and a handcam stream, where I'm trying foreign
1891680	1900000	sweets, or candy, if you're American, or if you're Australian you say lollipops,
1901600	1908080	so yeah, I did a little cheeky handcam stream, I think there's a few handcam streams coming up
1908080	1912240	from my gen mates already, someone was surprised I was doing handcam and I'm like,
1915040	1920800	I mean, we're not like, I don't know what part kind of tips you off that we're not like other
1920800	1926560	agencies, unironically, like was it the 80-20 split maybe, did that tip you off, or like the 100%
1926560	1931600	marriage sales got the talent, was it that part that tips you off that we're not quite like any other
1932320	1940880	agency, but yeah, let's go to Chihuahua, that's a lot of movement, it's a lot of movement,
1940880	1947120	but yes, that is my first week, I'm pretty much an endurance streamer, so good luck keeping up with
1947120	1958800	me, okay, Emmy Dookie, Emmy, right, thank you all so much, we are all going to collectively have
1958800	1964960	a 30-minute rest, and then guess what, you get to see us all interact together live, okay, we're
1964960	1971600	going to be telling some funny stories, some rather embarrassing stories, but hey ho, it's good content,
1971600	1978480	it's good content, that's right, and I will thank you all so much for all the love that
1978480	1982960	we've shown myself or my gen mates at will, and we will see you in 30 minutes, you will
1982960	1989120	automatically be redirected into the lovely group room, and we will see you in 30 minutes, okay,
1989120	1994800	can you wait 30 minutes, 30 more minutes, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, I'll see you then, okay,
1994800	2000640	thank you so much, bye!
