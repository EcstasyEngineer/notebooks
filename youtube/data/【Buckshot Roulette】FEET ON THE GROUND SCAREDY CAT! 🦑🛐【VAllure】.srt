1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
No time to wait for my days, we're getting longer in peace

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
No time to wait for my days, of all the time

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Right, this is British lore

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh wait, hold on

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Dule Lover, thank you for becoming a member, I have no idea what it's like even says I'm online yet

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No it doesn't, oh this is the thing, whenever I look back on a board

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm like rambling to myself for a full minute, because for some reason it doesn't bring itself up for a full minute

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Even though I'm sitting here, meh meh meh, but when I look back on the board

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And all that, it's all fine

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's all fine

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The fine line

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Right, where are we? Nope

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Nope, not yet

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Not playing the game yet

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, I am your host, Ronnie Cuttles

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Coming at you with a fried voice, thank you

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Dule Lover becoming a member in case that did not register

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
She loves it, she loves it

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
On time question mark, yes I haven't been lurking in the shadows

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I had to do some bit of background work

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What's the background work you ask?

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I put Shabby Cottonbombs memberships live, so if you want to be a cheeky harem and get in

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But she might not say your name during the stream though

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're probably better waiting on the stream in two hours time

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Shabby Cottonbombs, maybe I should be a bit bigger, can I talk in a minute?

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm looking and looking

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well I'll just stand right here, like right over the text and everything

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why not? Why not? Why do I have to be professional?

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hold on, I'll actually go weave, because BOOM!

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, little reeflings

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is on the agendination for week three?

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So we're starting off strong with an ASMR stream at the usual time

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And then after two hours I will go offline and have a 15 minute peace break

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Because we're going to be doing our first membership watch-along

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Which is none other than the first Transformers movie with Sam Witwicky and Bumblebee

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sweet little Bumblebee, I know what he wants from me

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
To kill the Decepticon and stop them from ruining the planet

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then the following day, on a Tuesday for the rest of the world

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We are playing Zelda Minish Cap

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now statistically this game takes roughly eight hours to finish

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Whether or not it takes me eight hours, I don't know

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But we will be taking a pause 15 minutes before because for a member stream

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We're going to be doing the forbidden tear list

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Not the way you want, the big yin

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I get to answer it honestly this time

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Because I'm allowed to say what I want to say

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If we do not finish it in the first day, which is unlikely due to the member stream

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then the rest of the day on Wednesday is dedicated to Zelda Minish Cap

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But it's the only Zelda game I have ever completed or played

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I know it's shocking, hold on, wait

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Whoa, it won't let me stretch out chat

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Chat, you'd let me stretch it

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Why the frick frack diddly-dat-tick-tack?

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Does it not let me stretch chat?

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wait, is it because I normally have you on the screen?

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh my god, let me stretch you, why is it locked?

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Chat is locked for me, so I can't even read just properly

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Brev, Brev

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm trying to explain what we're doing

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Anyway, I'm going to-

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Eh, you be next, thank you for becoming a member

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh my god, is that the mascot for, um, we Louie Vuitton Inc?

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm so sorry, her name evades me right now from all the live, Louie Vuitton Inc

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh my god, why is her name not in my mouth?

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Purple, with the most adorable little sea ears

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh my goodness

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Anyway

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Um, we are going to do Old School RuneScape on Thursday

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, and now my chat's broken completely

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh, thanks OBS, no really, thank you, please don't ever cook again

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, it finally worked, in on, yes, in on

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh my goodness, I don't know why chat wasn't working

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Chat, yeah, well it's fixed, I can actually read chat now

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In on, yes, in on, in my whole, thank you

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Um, let's see, so then we're going to do Old School RuneScape

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
However, check it, I'm doing my first ever one-on-one collab with the other girl

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And guess what, it's with Mercy

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I should have picked any kind of yandere

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But I got Mercy

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And we're going to be playing Goose Game, we're going to be playing it at her time

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So we're only going to do a little bit of RuneScape

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But if I can get a couple of levels in, I will take it

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Um, so a couple hours of RuneScape and blabbing away

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then I will go offline for a few hours to recharge

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Because I want to give Mercy my all, she's not ready for the Rotism Your Honor

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hey, thank you, Omarum Simpson

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It still doesn't display properly, even though I have the full chat up

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Memberships are showing up for me on YouTube mobile

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
For a sheebie cotton bum, they better be because we are redirecting into her

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you didn't know, sheebie has posted pictures of herself in a self-made cosplay of sheebie

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yep, that's a full sentence

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You may check them out by discovering the alternative twirers

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you don't know what the alternative twirers are, feel free to check out who the accounts are following

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But yes, at Mercy's usual stream time, I wanted to make the collab super easy for her

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So I am going to have to rest and snort

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Some...

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I shouldn't have said that

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm going to be taking lots of cola, okay

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going to be slurping my cola for any caffeination

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because I'm probably going to be a wee bit

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm going to start lagging a little bit there

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Ain't I meant for you either

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You don't have to give me money to tell me this

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You just realise that, Omarum

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You don't have to give me money to type things in chat

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Scotland, whatever

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes, erm

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, I was originally going to do a heart rate monitor this stream

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Count up for the life of me, find it

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I bought a new heart rate monitor because my other one was bust

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And it's already gone

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So I think I'm about to purchase a third one

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Lucky me

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll probably...

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If I send a care package to the girls like for Donothons

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Others have cubed mascots

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We have a cubed Scottish girl

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wait

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Did Brian talk?

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Did Brian say...

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No, did Brian say anything there?

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh shit, I didn't see that

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Aren't...

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Others have cubed mascots

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We have a cubed Scottish girl

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank you for the five iron report

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I appreciate it

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, I never heard that

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Sorry, I have my headset muted

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because I have the freaking game sound in the background

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's so loud

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Can't wait to see Strone as the imposter in this game

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Wait, what?

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No, wait

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We're playing Nero

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We're playing a game called Untitled Kiss Game

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If you didn't see AC actually revealed that she's playing with Emmy

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
On a game called Don't Starve

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I'm like, jeez, that's a bit brutal

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's exactly AC's lore

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because she had to hunt for her food

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So, rather curious

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Rather curious, aren't they?

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What else? Elden...

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes, Elden Ring the DLC

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Elden Ring the DLC, okay

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It launches on Friday

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm like 99% sure

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Even if it doesn't come out by the time we start playing

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We have a lot of areas to clear anyway

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I am under the impression

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We have to perish the enemy

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's at the top of this elevator

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In that graveyard

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And ironically Ryan Goslin was the one

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That vanquished him

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Because I couldn't do it

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I kept getting attacked

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So the reflands on a freaking debuff

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like a severe debuff

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Whilst I was running away from this boss

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
All came flying in

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And I'm like 99% sure

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ryan Goslin killed that one

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I do say shortcaller

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now I do have a shortcaller

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We're gonna test it out at the start stream

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If I can handle it

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I will permit my reflings to zap me

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Every time I cause us to die

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will try and keep the heart rate monitor too

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Just so you can see how freaking messed up I get

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Whenever we get near an enemy

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I need you to open your eyeballs for me

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Because members asmr stream starts

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
One hour earlier

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Than my usual start time

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The reason for that is

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Emi

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Azura

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Mercy

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Strawny

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Are doing a four man uno collab

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So that I can't get away from mercy this week

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm already entangled in her snare

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And then

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So that's two streams that day

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And then and then and then

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Sorry I did apologize for your head

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I didn't get a good sleep last night

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Again

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm getting very tired

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Actually I'll tell you something really bad

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I had to take sleep medicine the other day

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But whenever I take sleep medicine

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I have problems going number two

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And then I hurt my butt going number two

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If there's any

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Anyone that wants to help kiss it better

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And then Elden Ring part two

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We again will have a full endurance on that

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I am literally weaving

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So much content in between this as well

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Because I'm also starting up

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
My thank you series

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
My one ASMR video pair

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
1000 views thank you series

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I am absolutely

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Delighted and exhausted

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
To learn that I

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
My

222
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Scheduled

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Uploaded ASMR for 1000 subs

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I've already reached 7000

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Which means the debt of six is still to be paid

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm very thankful

227
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh man I'm tired

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
After this stream today

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm actually going to record

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Three

231
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Collab ASMR's from my side

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Because three girls have given me their side

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I need to edit that

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Unending ASMR's

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Back to back to back

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's so many replays now

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I know my mum is very busy

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If you didn't know

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
AC's meme ASMR has gone live

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It is sniffing ASMR

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If you like that trigger

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Mercy's ASMR has

244
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I got a fucking cat here in my mouth

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
All the time

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You really do get used to it

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
When you get cats honestly

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're just like oh that's just another part

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Mercy has released Yandere ASMR

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Please if you absolutely despise

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The meme ASMR's I got them to create

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Well guess who fucking

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Created them for them

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So if you hate them don't be like

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Mmm this video is stinky

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Be like mmm strongy stinky

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Because she came up with a concept

258
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So don't if you didn't like it

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't worry it's not like it's the only ASMR video

260
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They're ever going to produce for free on youtube

261
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Like fucking relax

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
For one

263
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm sorry I'm literally fighting imaginary people

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Not one person has said that

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
At all I know for a fact no one has said that

266
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And I'm like already swinging

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
On behalf of the girls

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like don't say nothing about my girls

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But yes

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Mercy's ASMR actually

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I was influenced by well

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So I had already created this

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Over a year ago

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And I think this was before the creator

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Of Yandere Sim got outed

276
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
For all of his

277
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm 32

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have so much power over me tweets

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Or whatever the tweet was

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't remember the ins and outs

281
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you didn't know

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
In Yandere Sim there's a mechanic

284
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Where in order to lower your craziness levels

285
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You need to laugh

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You need to laugh very loud

287
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And very startling

288
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And if anyone is around you while you laugh

289
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It alerts them

290
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And I was like how did I do that for Mercy

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So I did an intro

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
A little setting up the plot

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
She comes and finds you type thing

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And then she laughs like a maniac

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Ear to ear in the mic

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And I absolutely love it

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But I think that's cause

298
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I knew about it. I've never actually played Yandere Sim

299
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But yeah

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Preemptive defense is a good strategy

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Literally just smashing people's skulls in

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No one has said a thing to me

303
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But the rage has already taken over

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The only discord group with speedrun pan records

305
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Honestly

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Also Emi and Momi's ASMR came out

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh did Emi release it

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I went the complete

310
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Meme route for Emi

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But Emi isn't quite

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
With me on the same page

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Which is fine, it's completely fine

314
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
She has complete control

315
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So I was like upload it if you want it

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh wait she did upload it

317
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay

318
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So she kept the thumbnail the same

319
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay I thought she wasn't gonna like it

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay

321
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So she's called the video

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Alleyway Tingle Dealer

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Sells you completely legal tingles ASMR

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's good title

325
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I like that title

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
My title was

327
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
VTuber Sells You

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Tingles in an alleyway

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I think or something like that

330
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We did have to

331
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The artist at the time drew

332
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Emi

333
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Sorry they're twins

334
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
drew Emi

335
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So we had to put a little

336
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Sutton Sutton over

337
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I loved the 30 minute Japanese one

338
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm glad you enjoyed it

339
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That is basically what unscripted

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
ASMR turns it into

341
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If I don't have a script I will

342
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
YAP my head off

343
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So Emi also has her meme ASMR

344
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Now that she's monetized which is

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Fan Tiddlyastic

346
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The next

347
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Meme ASMR

348
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Which I'm actually gonna ask her permission

349
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
To do it once

350
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Once your monetization stream

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I know professional streamer by the way

352
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Once your monetization stream

353
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Has finished

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
My dear Shubu

355
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Would you like me to upload

356
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And pub

357
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Is it publish? No

358
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Upload and

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Put live your meme

360
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
ASMR

361
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You guys are gonna freaking love the plot

362
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Shibu's plot was so unique

363
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I had to go away and record

364
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Folly sounds which is rare

365
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
For me because I have a massive bank

366
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000

369
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You were loving the ear mask

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh you like the 7 girl

371
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000

372
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh yeah you like 7

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Ovens being together

374
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well if you're excited for that

378
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Next week there's another 7 man collab

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm gonna have to edit it

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The work never ends

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't know what you're saying

382
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Anonymous

383
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I love the ASMR you did with DTW

384
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And the rest oh thank you

385
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It was so hard to put together

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You know she's such a busy person

387
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I was so excited to see that

388
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh I'm glad you like it

389
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Thank you for the tip Anonymous

390
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes

391
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
7 man

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No 7 person collab

393
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
With another girl

394
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
V.A

395
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Surprise surprise you've already guessed

396
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What channel it's going on

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There's no way in heck

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You don't know who it is

399
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And then after that for next week

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There's another 7 man collab

401
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I need to put together

402
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The work never ends

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But the work is good

404
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Wait I'm gonna need confirmation

405
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Right think of one V.A

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That I talk to all the time

407
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And burst in in this chat all the time

408
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Thank

409
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's who's next

411
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And then the next one after that

412
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Actually did a watch along of us

413
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But

414
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Because I have the artwork so I can edit it

415
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But then the fourth

416
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000

417
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm waiting on this animator

418
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
To animate the artwork

419
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And the worst part is

420
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Well actually

421
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's not the worst part

422
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The animator that I usually use are like

423
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000

My stuff has been unedited

427
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And the deadline has slipped

428
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Almost 2 weeks now

429
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And I'm like congrats on your wedding

430
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But your honeymoon phase is over

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Please get off of her and let her have some rest

432
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay and do my work

433
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000

434
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000

438
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No I do have a collab with mimosa

439
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But that's a one on one collab

440
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000

441
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Remember of yumi plus as a 3dio

442
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I need to write the plot and send it to her

443
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And another piece of work that I have to do

444
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
By the way

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000

446
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Finally got a new short

447
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Pro shibi only has two shorts

448
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
She finally has a third

449
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000

Very thankful towards strawnee

456
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because strawnee gave shibi the script of praise

457
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So the reason why you hear shibi praise you

458
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
In that short

459
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Is because of strawnee

460
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So all of harem

461
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Please say thank you strawnee

462
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You're welcome little harem

463
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm looking after you

464
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Not only did I get her to say a short

465
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000

I still need to message you about

469
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Rearranging that

470
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
A collab

471
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Because

472
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
My dad

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Is coming home

474
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In July

475
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So

476
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
My dad's coming home

477
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Our father-in-law

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh do you want to meet your dad-in-law

479
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm not getting him to come on stream

480
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because he'll be like

481
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Hi Reeflings

482
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000

But yes

485
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
My dad

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Is coming home

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000

Is coming home

490
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I thought about a few stream ideas

491
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Like you know how some folk do

492
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000

493
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Reefling applications

495
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Like I don't know if maybe that would be funny

496
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Or I don't know if people wouldn't like that

497
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm gonna make a video

498
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Being a gamer and like

500
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
People can ask him questions and stuff

501
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Being like oh what is it like knowing that your daughter's

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000

Because I've muted the desktop audio

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't know if you watch football

513
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But I wanted to let you know that in the game

514

We won 5 to 1

516
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000

Was because I was begging to hold a pee pee

556
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
For someone's peace

557
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Can I tell them that nah my dad knows

558
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He doesn't know the channel

559
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But he knows like

560
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Because

561
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
What pays bills

562
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Let's still pretend

563
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Let's still pretend

564
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I wonder if my dad sounds like me

565
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh his accents even stronger than mine

566
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Um way stronger

567
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
One day we'll get to call

568
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
We'll get him to call us

569
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
His radish sons

570
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Do you want me to get him to say that

571
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I could do that usually

572
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Does your dad talk in scots too

573
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
We are so bad

574
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh yeah no my dad's like got a harsher accent than me

575
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Um so my mum

576
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
My mum told me

577
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Not to speak in slang

578
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But my dad does

579
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Cause he

580
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Is a

581
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I mean he just speaks

582
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Slang but my mum doesn't

583
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So I don't really do it cause

584
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Is your dad single

585
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
No

586
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Oh my god are you trying to be my mum

587
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What is going on here

588
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Hold on a minute

589
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000

That's fine by me

592
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Imagine Strani introducing a

593
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Refling to her dad as her boyfriend

594
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And he's sitting there all stern

595
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Threatening us not to hurt his precious

596
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Cuttlefish

597
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000

No my dad's like super nice and approachable

603
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You don't need to be scared of my dad

604
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Honestly

605
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Like he'd be like

606
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh are you looking after Strani

607
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And then you go

608
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
In your voice cause you're like scared of him

609
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And then he'll go

610
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000

611
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And then you go I think so

612
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
In your wee voice cause you're trembling

613
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And then after that

614
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Oh good that's it

615
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
My dad

616
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Me and my dad are on the same page

617
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Where as long as my dad's happy

618
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm happy

619
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
As long as I'm happy my dad's happy

620
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's super

621
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Super duper simple

622
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Like that

623
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's nice to do that

624
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Reflings are happy I'm happy

625
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If I'm happy

626
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000

Yes like this

630
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I think she's happy

631
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
She cusses me out regularly with a smile

632
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
On her face oh that's terrible

633
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What is the Scottish

634
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Shotgun and how's it different

635
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know

636
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
There's haggis in your face instead of pellets

637
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Papastrone

638
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Looks like

639
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The dad from how to train your dragon

640
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Wait hold on

641
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
How to train

642
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Your dragon

643
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That exhibition

644
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No

645
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
No he doesn't have beard

646
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
No beard

647
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Although he doesn't have beard

648
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But he has not stubble

649
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Although he does

650
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
One to actually

651
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'll tell you this is really funny

652
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
One time my dad tried to grow a beard

653
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And I was mortified

654
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I was like oh no

655
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's my mom's single

656
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
No

657
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You're teasing me refling

658
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
How do you think your dad would respond

659
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
If

660
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Refling said

661
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Or calls me daddy too

662
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Would I call you daddy

663
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I wouldn't think I'd call you daddy

664
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Like in my accent

665
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Daddy's pretty jarring and cringe

666
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Like oh yeah I like that daddy

667
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Mmm yeah

668
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Like no

669
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Do you want me to tell him

670
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Do you want me to tell him

671
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Like oh dad by the way

672
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The refling's call me mummy

673
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I don't

674
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't think he's going to get it

675
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
If I explain it

676
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't think he's going to get it

677
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I think he's going to be like what

678
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh I don't think he's going to confirm

679
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That would be amazing

680
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh yeah daddy

681
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Give me a spicy sausage

682
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Literally no it doesn't work

VTuber calls you mummy now

686
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I have to admit it is an absolute cheat

687
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Code if any VTuber

688
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The girls unanimously

747
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So much that

748
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Paypal emailed

749
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And we're like

750
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Some of your funds are on hold

751
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Not all of them

752
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But yes thank you so much

753
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Outcry no for the outgoing

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Insane support

756
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Of me darlin

757
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You have literally

758
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You support so much at the start

759
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You broke the account

760
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And now some funds are on hold

761
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Because there's so much money coming in

762
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It was actually a snowberry

763
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That did it so shout out to the snowberries

764
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You broke

765
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
A little bit of the Paypal

766
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Holy shit did you hear my cat

767
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Fucking I was playing with Gimli

768
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Before I started

769
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Extreme

770
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I wish he was going mental again

771
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And I think I warmed her up too much

772
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Get supported, get supported, get supported

773
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Nero

774
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Imagine thinking that listening

775
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That would be crazy

776
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And mommy and daddy and I think

777
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Accent isn't hot that would drive

778
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That would be crazy

779
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well I get real close to you

780
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm looking you in your eye

781
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Is that what you should be saying

782
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Oh my god do you know those convention

783
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Signs

784
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Those VTuber conventions where they like hold a sign

785
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And it's like five dollars to get stood on

786
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Bro

787
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
50 cent for me to smash my

788
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Arse on your face how about that

789
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
One cent for me

790
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
A whisper daddy

791
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
In your ear how about that

792
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Okay

793
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We're going to do a thing at this VTuber convention

794
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Called undercutting the market

795
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You offer your goods

796
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
At an unbelievably discounted price

797
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Now I know undercutting

798
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Normally implies there's going to be

799
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
A raise later on

800
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
We ain't raising none of the prices

801
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The prices you see are the prices you get

802
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Pills out 20 bucks

803
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Take all my change that's a steal

804
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Strongly really undercutting the market now

805
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm like 99% sure

806
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I saw a cosplayer meme

807
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And she genuinely had a sign

808
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That said like five dollars

809
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
To be stepped on and she was like

810
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I made like four hundred dollars

811
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
In a day type thing

812
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So I guess

813
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
For that much we are getting married

814
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
With 50 children

815
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Thank you for the

816
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Is that Poland

817
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I don't know what that is

818
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Pozka

819
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So I guess for that much

820
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
We're getting married with 50 children

821
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Nah no children

822
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Did you see Azura's alternative artwork

823
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
She did break all

824
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
What Azura did what

825
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I didn't know she was down like that

826
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I didn't know she was

827
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Down like that

828
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
She drew that of her

829
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
She drew that

830
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yes Azura is an artist if you didn't know

831
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Literally all the girls have some sort of

832
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Drawing

833
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
History

834
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Background

835
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
KFP Spidey again with the five gifted

836
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your

837
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Face

838
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
In your face

839
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh my god we need to play Kung Fu Chaos again

840
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Tornado

841
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Your doodles are so cute

842
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh no

843
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I don't know how to draw

844
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Actually I could

845
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I should have shown it on the hand cam stream

846
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I tried to

847
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Learn to draw

848
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And I was consistent for like five days

849
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Before work just got far too much

850
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I couldn't keep up with work naturally

851
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And the only thing

852
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I was wanting to draw

853
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Was the girls

854
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So I have like terrible pictures

855
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Of me drawing the girls like way back

856
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
A couple of months ago now

857
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Sadly life got in the way but

858
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I actually do genuinely think if I ever hit

859
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
The Jenga with the five gifted

860
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Memberships thank you

861
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face

862
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
In your face

863
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Sorry I'm really

864
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If you didn't know there's a character called

865
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Candy Roll in Kung Fu Chaos

866
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Her and sweet and sour

867
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Were my favourite characters

868
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And when my voice gets squeaky

869
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Internally, not externally

870
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But internally because of the

871
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You hear yourself differently

872
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
From out loud

873
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I sound like Candy Roll

874
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
When I get really high pitched

875
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And I

876
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Know all her voice lines

877
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Was it ekololalia

878
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
When you repeat what you've heard

879
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And she's like

880
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's my candy ass

881
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And I just love her so much

882
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
She's just like 10 out of 10 characters

883
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Oh my god

884
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Gen 2 roller skates confirmed

885
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Sorry some sort of girl on roller skates

886
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I don't care

887
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Bimbo! Oh my god we don't have a bimbo

888
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Wait

889
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What would the bimbo be

890
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Maybe like a bimbo that lowers your expectations

891
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And then does something

892
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Xenowarrier thank you for coming

893
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Remember

894
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Roller skates

895
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
A bimbo maid

896
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I would need something a bit more than a maid

897
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I feel like maid is very default

898
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I don't know maid a bimbo maid

899
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That is quite nice though

900
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Bimbo maid is cute

901
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Because then she can spell stuff

902
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
On you all the time

903
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And then before you know

904
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Bimbo

905
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Possum

906
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
A possum mod

907
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Remove this man's testicles

908
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Possum

909
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
As in the thing in them that goes

910
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Anonymous

911
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm so conflicted about

912
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Who is my favourite in VLR

913
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Please hypnotise me to stay loyal

914
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
To you mummy

915
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Keep that thought in mind

916
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Not for what you think

917
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Because next week

918
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We may or may not be rating

919
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
A very unique audio roleplay

920
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Paul Lott

921
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That involves me and

922
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The girls

923
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Maybe that kind of script

924
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Perhaps sea queen

925
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Script

926
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Might solidify

927
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Who your choice is at VLR

928
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Jealous mother

929
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I assure you

930
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I wish to share all

931
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
All the goodness

932
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
All the spice

933
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I have clear ideas

934
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
A possum are kind of cute

935
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
A masochistic maid

936
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Is meta

937
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But it never goes out of meta

938
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I was debating on when to get membership

939
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And then I decided if it's not on the day

940
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Strongly offers 50

941
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Cent butt smashes

942
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What day will it be?

943
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Honestly do you think conventions would let us get away with that?

944
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Like obviously I'll be wearing a mask

945
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And I'll have a little wig

946
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So my hair is the same

947
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But I feel like no one can stop

948
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You're like

949
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh what are you going to do

950
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
A reefling lies down on the floor

951
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And I quickly butt bash him and then get back up again

952
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Is that kickable to get out of the corner

953
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I feel like that's such a baby thing

954
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Oops I tripped and landed on my reeflings face

955
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
No

956
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It depends I guess

957
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Because it would be really weird messaging

958
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The convention and being like

959
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Hey

960
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Am I allowed to fall on the

961
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Faces of reeflings

962
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Question mark

963
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Am I allowed... well if they allowed

964
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Stepping because then you can start to argue

965
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Like oh but you allow other

966
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
VTubers to step on them

967
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Did you know that is also vexally

968
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Besifying

969
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
When I trip and fall on a reeflings face

970
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
With my

971
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Arse

972
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That's unacceptable

973
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But if I step on them that's acceptable

974
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh my god

975
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Convention

976
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Talk about having double sided

977
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Is it because I'm Scottish

978
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Convention

979
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You can't do that

980
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You can't show that you

981
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Believe in the British Isles

982
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Sorry

983
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You need Kingdom over

984
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Scotland

985
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Oh my god convention

986
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You don't believe in the independence of

987
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Scotland

988
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Convention

989
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You can't say that stuff out loud

990
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah

991
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Albuphobia

992
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Sounds like asking for trouble

993
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Well good thing my name is

994
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Johnny because we're making it double

995
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's right me out

996
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Sorry I was kind of going on

997
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Team rockets

998
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Blasting off again

999
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Oh wait that's not what they sound like

1000
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That sounded like cream

1001
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Please be careful not to fall

1002
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
What

1003
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
As

1004
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Team rockets

1005
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Blasting off again

1006
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's kind of there

1007
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah

1008
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Convention what do you mean

1009
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So there's a possibility

1010
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
In a certain timeline

1011
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Um

1012
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I may or may not be able to

1013
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Make it to our convention

1014
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Um

1015
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I would love to do that

1016
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But the only problem is

1017
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
We have a bomb

1018
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And I'd actually need to hire

1019
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
A bodyguard two bodyguards

1020
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Or one bodyguard

1021
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Bro I'm going to be so embarrassed

1022
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Messaging security is like

1023
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
A private security comment being like

1024
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Hey I basically need

1025
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Security persons to follow me

1026
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Around a convention is that fine

1027
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Like for bodyguard

1028
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Well I feel like the reeflings

1029
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Would bodyguard me pretty much

1030
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So like any shitters would like you know

1031
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Get eaten up

1032
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I thought this thumbnail said

1033
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Backshot bro you've been on the

1034
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Patreon a lot too much

1035
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Okay that bodyguard on me

1036
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Three four four is quite a lot

1037
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Four is because you're Scottish

1038
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Nearly

1039
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Nearly even

1040
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
United with the UK

1041
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Five might be a good number

1042
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Five little reeflings

1043
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And a paycheck's a paycheck

1044
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Literally

1045
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The bodyguards

1046
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Just watching me like sit on everyone's

1047
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
face

1048
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Being like what have I been hired for

1049
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I thought it was a convention for like

1050
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Weaves or something

1051
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Like not understanding this like for Retubers

1052
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
We probably

1053
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Get weirder requests

1054
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
plausible

1055
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
True blood reeflings would be natural

1056
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Bodyguards

1057
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I think I would have to hire professional

1058
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Security

1059
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah no that's not the plan

1060
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
A sniper too steady

1061
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm not trying to take anyone's heats off

1062
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Okay and what is this

1063
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
France when Star Wars got released

1064
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Did you know

1065
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That in France when Star Wars got released

1066
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Was the last public beheading

1067
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Hmm

1068
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
What if they are also reeflings

1069
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The bodyguards I don't think bodyguards

1070
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
With a full time job have enough time

1071
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
To listen to me Japanese

1072
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
About anything and everything

1073
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That comes to my head

1074
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
What yeah it's true

1075
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The year that Star Wars came out

1076
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Which is

1077
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Nineteen

1078
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Seven

1079
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
What year did first

1080
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Star Wars come

1081
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I don't know

1082
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
1977

1083
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Was the last year there was a public execution

1084
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
In France and also just happens to be

1085
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The year that Star Wars first came out

1086
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Leaving yeah

1087
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I've been at hold

1088
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I have a full time job

1089
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I can hear you yapping and so why not

1090
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
How though aren't you getting distracted at work

1091
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Can I give you a bone bone at work

1092
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
When we do the ASMR stream please

1093
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The thought I have that kind of power

1094
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's too much power

1095
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Unlimited power

1096
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Speaking of Star Wars

1097
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Unlimited power

1098
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I was freaked me out that scene

1099
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You have done that to me at work

1100
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah stop you're gonna give me an ego

1101
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's like one of my favourite freaking concepts

1102
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Oh my god should I write

1103
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
A joystick

1104
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
About doing it at work

1105
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And being subtle

1106
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
No I don't want you to get fired

1107
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I don't want to encourage such behaviours

1108
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'd rather you didn't get fired

1109
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
As much as you may despise

1110
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Work as a whole

1111
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It's good for routine for the brain

1112
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's good for socialisation

1113
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's good for keeping you active

1114
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And the neurons firing

1115
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Maybe capitalism won a little bit there

1116
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But maybe reduce it to a four day work week

1117
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
A four day work week

1118
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And not putting it up to ten hours

1119
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Because that's outrageous

1120
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And then for those

1121
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Who choose to not

1122
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Those who work on Friday, Saturday, Sunday

1123
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Get a cheeky bit of overtime as well

1124
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Because that's not common in all countries

1125
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Anyway before the tinfoil hat goes back on

1126
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
What it's been 44 minutes already

1127
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Guys why didn't you tell me to start the game

1128
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Are you squidding me right now

1129
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You and the rest of the girls

1130
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Sheepy goes live in T-Main

1131
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And we're in five

1132
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Showing her thighs and feet

1133
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I have taken so long and been so

1134
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Distracted

1135
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Let's turn on this desktop audio

1136
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So you guys can hear what I hear

1137
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And let me turn off my

1138
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Background theme

1139
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
This is what I hear in buckshot

1140
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Okay we're just going to jump into it

1141
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Hopefully that's not too loud

1142
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Testing

1143
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Let's get my schedule off stream

1144
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We know what schedule is

1145
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
We're very thankful

1146
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
It's been 45 minutes, start the game

1147
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Oh now you tell me

1148
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I might have to

1149
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Put brightness up

1150
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I noticed that in my Crash Bandicoot stream

1151
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The brightness was so not bright

1152
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But on my screens it was bright

1153
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Hold on, hydration

1154
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
V-B-N-Y

1155
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
V-N-N-Four

1156
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Hold the scape tag

1157
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Oh

1158
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Oh my god

1159
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
We're Germans

1160
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Germans like to rave

1161
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Abandoned buildings for some reason

1162
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Can I get a light mate?

1163
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Are you got anything on you?

1164
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Are you got a wee baggie on you?

1165
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
No right, we'll just keep going then

1166
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Please sign the waiver

1167
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
What's my name?

1168
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh my god my name is

1169
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Ah

1170
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Ne

1171
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That's me

1172
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That's you

1173
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Dealer

1174
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Anon

1175
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
One live round, two blanks

1176
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I insert the shells

1177
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
In an unknown order

1178
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Oh my god this back

1179
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Like the faded out background music

1180
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Shotgun, shooting yourself with a blank

1181
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Skips the dealer's turn

1182
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
If there's two blanks

1183
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I shoot myself

1184
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Okay, okay, okay, statistically

1185
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
We're now at 50-50

1186
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
We're at 50-50

1187
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'd rather give it to him

1188
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Shooting yourself

1189
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
No, I want to shoot him, how do I do that?

1190
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I shoot the dealer, 50-50

1191
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I'm sorry mate

1192
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Oh no

1193
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Oh no, he's gonna

1194
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
A defibrillator

1195
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Careful now

1196
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Defit

1197
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Alive

1198
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Three rounds, two blanks

1199
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Odds are what?

1200
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
They enter the chamber in a hidden sequence

1201
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Free live

1202
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I want to shoot, sorry

1203
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Three live, two blank

1204
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Okay, now it's 50-50

1205
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Two live, two blank

1206
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Mmm

1207
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Okay, okay, that's good, that's good

1208
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Cause now it's two live, one blank

1209
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Okay

1210
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I am shit at this game

1211
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
You're lucky

1212
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I left you with a charge

1213
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Get up and on

1214
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The knight is young

1215
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Do you want this?

1216
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay

1217
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Do I need to turn the brightness up on stream?

1218
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So

1219
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The game

1220
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Is it bright enough for you guys?

1221
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Sorry, I'm gonna read chat

1222
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
No, it's good, it's good, okay, thank you

1223
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I don't know why, but Crash Bandicoot was so dark

1224
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Wait, is he the one that raised me then?

1225
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Oh

1226
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Welcome back

1227
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Hi

1228
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I thought this game took like 20 minutes to

1229
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
One live round, two blanks

1230
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Okay, the odds are in my favor

1231
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
For a blank, so I'm gonna

1232
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Myself

1233
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Oh, okay

1234
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Okay, safe, safe, and then again

1235
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The 50, surely I wouldn't lose

1236
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
The 50-50 the second time around

1237
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
BLEET! BLEET!

1238
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Are you serious?

1239
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Are you serious?

1240
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
What the heck? I thought this was an easy game

1241
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Careful now

1242
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Oh goodness me

1243
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Right, three live, two blank

1244
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I

1245
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Used up all my luck on my daughters

1246
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That's what's happened

1247
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Three live, shoot the dealer

1248
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Okay, the game is feeling kind

1249
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Because there's now two live

1250
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And one blank

1251
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The game is trying to let me win now

1252
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I'm just gonna keep shooting

1253
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Okay, okay, we did it

1254
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We did it, we did it

1255
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
See, I do not gamble

1256
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I have absolutely no

1257
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Interesting gamble

1258
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And on which you won, replaying

1259
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You did it!

1260
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Let's go

1261
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Let's make this a little more

1262
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Interesting

1263
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Sorry, I'm getting comfy on my chair

1264
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm sitting on my toes

1265
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Two items each

1266
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
More items before every load

1267
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
This is my kind of game

1268
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Oh, sheebie!

1269
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You didn't tell me you were a part of this game

1270
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Sheebie!

1271
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You do not, sheebie

1272
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Four

1273
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
One live, one blank

1274
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yeah

1275
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So what do you do?

1276
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Dealer

1277
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Skips the next

1278
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
turn

1279
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Does that mean if I sheebie him up?

1280
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So I can just

1281
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Shoot both of them and win

1282
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah

1283
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And then I get to shoot again

1284
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Okay, yeah, yeah

1285
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm getting it, I'm getting it

1286
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm getting it, so we win

1287
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Take that

1288
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Okay

1289
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Okay, now what?

1290
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Oh, I get more items every round

1291
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Okay, you should come front

1292
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Be your

1293
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Meh!

1294
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
What was that? No, no, no, come back out

1295
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
What was that? It said God

1296
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
A magnifying glass

1297
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
What was that? It said God

1298
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Two

1299
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Oh, it's a 50-50 again

1300
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
What does beer do?

1301
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Racks the shotgun

1302
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Ejects current shell

1303
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Racks the shotgun

1304
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Check the current

1305
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Round in the chamber

1306
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Whoa!

1307
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's a blank

1308
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
So I'll shoot me

1309
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Rack equals pump

1310
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'll pump you in a minute

1311
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Don't worry

1312
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I don't know if that means the same

1313
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But in Scots that means I'm gonna do you

1314
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Okay

1315
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Well, I did a blank

1316
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So two to one

1317
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Okay, okay

1318
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Oh, poor dealer

1319
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
He's going down, but I don't wish

1320
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
him any ill will

1321
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
He just looks creepy, but I don't

1322
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
He's taking a cigarette

1323
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
You know, a cigarette

1324
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
What? Cigarettes are bad for your health

1325
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
To health?

1326
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Bro

1327
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
He heals up

1328
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and does double damage to me

1329
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
You wet fart

1330
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Release me

1331
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Oh, I've lost this

1332
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I don't know what kind of

1333
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I don't know what kind of

1334
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
stuff be going on

1335
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Sure, I'll take that and that

1336
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Why not?

1337
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Two blanks

1338
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Three live

1339
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I'll win in this one

1340
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh

1341
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
This is such a creative game though

1342
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I'll give it though, I like this

1343
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It's live

1344
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Well, you'll never guess who I'm shooting

1345
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
That's so satisfying

1346
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I like how it's not too loud either

1347
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Do I need to lower in-game volume or it's all good to go

1348
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Again

1349
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Okay

1350
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It's fine, all good

1351
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Okay, okay

1352
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Oh, can I do multiple items per round?

1353
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Wow

1354
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I got two blanks, the game's feeling nice to me

1355
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Right, I think I can just shoot him

1356
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
because there's only one left and it's live

1357
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah, take that

1358
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You wet fart

1359
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Okay, we're back on an even

1360
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
plain field

1361
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Okay, what items

1362
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
What items

1363
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
What a curious game

1364
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
God

1365
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Okay, all I'm getting is handcuffs and beer

1366
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
50-50, right

1367
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Right, I'll handcuff him

1368
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Um, please take these

1369
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
handcuffs

1370
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Oh, it's a harem

1371
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Eject the current shell

1372
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It's 50-50, this will change the odds

1373
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
out of 50-50

1374
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Shit!

1375
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
The odds are more likely it's a live round

1376
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Oh, we're doing it

1377
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
We're doing it, we have probability

1378
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Okay

1379
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Now it's likely to be blank

1380
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
because the odds are now

1381
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
one live to two blank

1382
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
or three blank

1383
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Oh, I don't like this part

1384
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Okay, okay, it's fine

1385
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It's fine

1386
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Right, and now

1387
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
it's again back to being live

1388
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Unless

1389
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
put the gun down

1390
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I can't change my mind

1391
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Live

1392
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
No!

1393
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I'm not going to make every blanks

1394
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Oh, he knows what's inside

1395
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Very interesting

1396
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yeah, I'm not surprised

1397
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I'm not surprised

1398
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It's a 1v1

1399
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Careful now

1400
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Oh no

1401
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I don't know what, I don't even

1402
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I genuinely

1403
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
do not know what's in this

1404
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
There's no point in racking the shell

1405
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Is there?

1406
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Cuff him, everyone says cuff him

1407
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Right, I'll listen to the replays because you guys are smart

1408
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Right, I've cuffed him

1409
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And then I'm gonna

1410
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Okay

1411
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Oh, I just ended the round

1412
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Yes, I'll absolutely take that

1413
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Oh, and the Sugi

1414
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Giyazawi

1415
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Whoa, the odds are

1416
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
very high for a live round

1417
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Sorry

1418
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Look, I'm not this smart, it's right

1419
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Regain a charge, I'll have a wee puff puff

1420
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Puff puff puff

1421
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yes, nicotine

1422
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
No, it's not good, don't ever

1423
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
actually do it

1424
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
A blank, right, okay

1425
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Okay, okay, me

1426
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Okay, that's good to go

1427
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Okay, so now it's like 5 to 1

1428
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
We're just gonna shoot

1429
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
What a curious game

1430
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I'm very intrigued by this

1431
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I'm intrigued by the dev team

1432
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I'm intrigued by the graph

1433
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
You won, Refling!

1434
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And on one

1435
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah

1436
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Long last, we arrive at the final showdown

1437
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
No more defibrillators

1438
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
No more blood transfusions

1439
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Now me and you, we are dancing

1440
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
on the edge of life and death

1441
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Eh

1442
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Eh

1443
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Eh

1444
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Four items each

1445
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Handcuff

1446
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Handcuff

1447
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Magnifying glass, handcuff

1448
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I'm starting to forget about the feet

1449
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Eh, you know the drill

1450
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Is he gonna handcuff me?

1451
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
If I handcuff him

1452
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I can double

1453
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I can double shoot

1454
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and the odds are he's gonna get shot

1455
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Okay, there you go

1456
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Okay, we're doing it, we're doing it

1457
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Doesn't tell you what his health actually is

1458
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So he's

1459
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So we can just double

1460
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Oh no, they're both blank, aren't they?

1461
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Ah, yeah

1462
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Wait, no

1463
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Oh no

1464
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I messed up, hold on

1465
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Yeah, okay, right

1466
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Fresh start and two new items

1467
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
What we get, what we get

1468
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Show me the money, we got beer

1469
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
More handcuffs

1470
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, a beer

1471
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
More handcuffs

1472
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Four live, four blank

1473
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
50-50

1474
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Handcuff

1475
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
That gives me two in a row

1476
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Eject one to make

1477
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
seven on the board

1478
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Odds are live

1479
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Blank

1480
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Two blank remaining

1481
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Four live, odds are

1482
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Shoot, shoot, shoot

1483
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Shoot, shoot, shoot

1484
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
One

1485
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Blank

1486
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Four live

1487
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Wow

1488
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Can't give him that

1489
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Can eject again

1490
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Wait, no, wait

1491
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
What did I just do, sorry, eject

1492
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Live, three live, one blank

1493
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Shoot

1494
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah

1495
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Cuff him, oh could I have cuffed there?

1496
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
No, he's still cuffed

1497
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Okay, now he's uncuffed

1498
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
He's gonna eject

1499
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Two live, one blank

1500
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Oh, handcuff though

1501
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Health revivals

1502
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Eject to live

1503
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Two live remaining

1504
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Son of double for two health

1505
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
No

1506
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Three health total taken

1507
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Out of two live

1508
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
This game is good

1509
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
This game is good

1510
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Oh, I like this game

1511
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Hold on

1512
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Okay, we got health

1513
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
We got a peak, we got two peaks

1514
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
A health and a cuff

1515
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Three live, two blank

1516
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Okay

1517
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We're gonna cuff

1518
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
We're gonna heal

1519
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
We're gonna heal

1520
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Because we do need a cheeky bit health

1521
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Because it is

1522
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Three live, two blank

1523
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Do we take a peak or do we

1524
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Wait, no, just taking a peak

1525
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Matter if he's cuffed

1526
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Well, because yeah

1527
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Doesn't matter

1528
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
No, it doesn't

1529
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
That's what

1530
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Two blank

1531
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Oh, dear

1532
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Oh, dear

1533
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Doesn't matter if he's cuffed

1534
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Doesn't matter what the results are

1535
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I've already forgotten what we're at

1536
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Is it one live, two blank

1537
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Or two live, one blank

1538
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
He's got two heals on the board

1539
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And he's got double son off

1540
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Now it's two live, one blank

1541
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Sugar didoo

1542
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeah, he's gonna shoot me

1543
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
No, for two health

1544
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
He's gonna shoot me for the son off

1545
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Oh, this is

1546
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
My odds

1547
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Gosh

1548
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Wow, hopefully

1549
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I can get some cigarettes

1550
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Right

1551
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Cuff

1552
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Wait, why cuff?

1553
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's two blank now

1554
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It's two blank now

1555
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Yeah, so why

1556
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Shouldn't have cuffed

1557
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Remaining ammo

1558
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Zero, they're both blank

1559
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
What

1560
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I'm not right, I need to focus up

1561
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I'm getting, I need a piece of paper or something

1562
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Maybe there won't be one

1563
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Right, items, cuffs

1564
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Peak, peak

1565
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And oh, we've got a double son off

1566
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
If we peak, we could get a double

1567
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
We could get a double

1568
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Four to two

1569
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Four

1570
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
To two

1571
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Cuff him

1572
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Let me know what's going on under the hood

1573
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Let me double up the damage under the hood

1574
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Beautiful

1575
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Let us acquire two HP damage

1576
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Oh

1577
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's fine

1578
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So now we are three live

1579
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Two blank

1580
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Now it is a two in three

1581
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Oh dear

1582
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear

1583
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Oh, he just released the blank

1584
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh no

1585
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Oh no, this can't be

1586
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
This can't be

1587
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Oh dear

1588
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I am on life support

1589
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I believe there's

1590
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Unless that's it, I don't know

1591
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
There's two on

1592
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Okay

1593
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Well, I'm handcuffed

1594
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
He's won

1595
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I've lost the odds game

1596
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Oh no

1597
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Strummer bad, I'm handcuffed

1598
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Are you ready?

1599
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Yeah

1600
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Well, I can

1601
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Hopefully there's a heal

1602
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Double damage

1603
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Double damage

1604
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Double damage

1605
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Aww, what are these?

1606
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Oh, live, live, live, live

1607
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Five live, three

1608
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Goodness

1609
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Me, heals don't work anymore

1610
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Oh, you can't even heal anymore

1611
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Oh, that's why the game's giving me

1612
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Triple damage, right? Let's see what I'm working with

1613
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Blank

1614
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
What was it?

1615
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Five to three, so now it's five to two

1616
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And then

1617
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
We'll just check again

1618
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Okay, live

1619
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And then we'll do double damage

1620
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Unfortunately, the odds

1621
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Are not in our favor

1622
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But hey ho, so that's four

1623
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
To two

1624
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
You're not gonna make it

1625
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Unless he throws

1626
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
We ain't gonna make it

1627
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Oh wait, what?

1628
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Oh

1629
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Oh, wait

1630
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Are you saying there's a chance?

1631
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
If it's in the chamber

1632
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Are you saying there's a chance?

1633
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Against all odds?

1634
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I

1635
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
What'd I do with it?

1636
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Oh my gosh

1637
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
From the brink

1638
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
What a fantastic game

1639
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Oh my goodness

1640
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
What a fantastic game

1641
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Press any button to exit

1642
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Wow

1643
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Double or nothing unlocked

1644
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Wow

1645
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Are these the developers?

1646
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
The symbol?

1647
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
By computer game by

1648
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Mike Kaluub

1649
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Nika

1650
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Congrats!

1651
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
What a fantastic game

1652
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
The visuals, the direction

1653
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Do we go again?

1654
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Do we go again?

1655
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Double or nothing? How did I do double or nothing?

1656
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Is it just start?

1657
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Just start

1658
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Start then click the pill bowl

1659
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Wow

1660
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
It's changed

1661
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Because of our progress

1662
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I'll click the pill bowl

1663
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Consume pills

1664
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
May impair your ability to drive

1665
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But reeflings, I don't want you to go

1666
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Consume the double or nothing

1667
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh no the guy's gone

1668
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Bye strongy, no reefling no more

1669
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Please sign the waiver

1670
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Yes

1671
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I am blown away by this game

1672
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Sorry, wait I know how to spell your name

1673
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Sorry, sorry

1674
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Sorry I didn't mean to misspell it

1675
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
It was a genuine mistake

1676
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Double damage

1677
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Handcuff

1678
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Mobile phone

1679
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
What are you?

1680
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
One live to blank

1681
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I

1682
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
A mysterious voice gives you insight

1683
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
From the future

1684
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Swap the polarity

1685
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I think we'll just cuff and double shoot

1686
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
If the both of the blanks happen to be in there

1687
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Wow I have rubbish luck

1688
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Okay that's fine

1689
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Now it's a 50-50

1690
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
If I shoot a blank at him I'm going to be

1691
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Should I go all

1692
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Oh I'll tell you

1693
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Okay rough start

1694
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Double or nothing, rough start

1695
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Oh he's double starting

1696
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Now it's a rough start

1697
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Jeez I've got

1698
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Two health already

1699
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
He's got a health upload

1700
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Smokes as well

1701
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Hydration check

1702
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Okay we can pump one out of the chamber

1703
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
We can heal and we can swap

1704
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Oh another polarity

1705
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Wow okay interesting curious

1706
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Again

1707
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
With a blank

1708
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I am going to pump one out of the chamber

1709
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
To see what the odds are

1710
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Okay now it's 50-50

1711
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
So I'm going to heal up

1712
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Because we already know what's going to happen

1713
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And then we're going to

1714
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Sol it off

1715
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And we're going all in on

1716
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Double damage against him

1717
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Dealer

1718
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Use the phone

1719
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Right I'll use the phone

1720
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
The phone about the current round or the next round

1721
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Oh my god he's doing double damage

1722
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Against me

1723
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
That's so bad

1724
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Right I'll do the phone, my apologies

1725
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I thought the phone was like for the next round

1726
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Careful now

1727
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Careful refling

1728
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Wouldn't want to be dancing

1729
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Death row

1730
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Let's see you

1731
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
What is you

1732
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Okay

1733
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Let's ring ring

1734
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Hello

1735
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Three lie four blank

1736
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
The game is trying its best to help me right now

1737
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
A mysterious voice

1738
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
How smart do you think

1739
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I am reflings

1740
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
To be able to retain

1741
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Information that on the sixth

1742
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Shell it's blank

1743
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
How smart do you think I am

1744
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
What is this a pipe bomb

1745
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Steal an item

1746
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And use it

1747
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Well

1748
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Oh no

1749
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Oh that's exactly what happens

1750
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
They put adrenaline directly into

1751
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Your bloodstream

1752
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
What was that medicine box

1753
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I wonder what this is

1754
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I don't have it yet

1755
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
There's nothing I can do

1756
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Are those in coffin and double shoot

1757
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
That also means the fifth isn't going to be blank

1758
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Are those going to be blank

1759
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I just need to send it

1760
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Sorry I can't

1761
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
No okay

1762
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So it means these next few are alive

1763
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Gotta go straight to coffin

1764
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Meet

1765
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Okay

1766
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Okay I've definitely messed up this one

1767
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
What is that

1768
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
A medicine packet

1769
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
He takes a pill

1770
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Aw healed

1771
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Okay that's fine cigarette or pills healed

1772
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Oh no

1773
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I've lost

1774
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I've lost

1775
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Oh no

1776
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Who is he calling

1777
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Literally I get

1778
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Aw that's such a shame

1779
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Wait

1780
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
He put the polarising effect on

1781
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Oh no I'm gone

1782
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Sorry

1783
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Sorry sorry

1784
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I didn't know how the phone worked

1785
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Not that it probably would have helped

1786
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Oh by the way the sixth one's a blank

1787
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Aw thanks for that mate

1788
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Let me just add it into my fucking calculator

1789
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Have the largest IQ

1790
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
My brain goes three sides

1791
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
You know the average person who can only retain

1792
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Like freaking what

1793
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Four bits of information at a time

1794
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Like come on give me a chance game

1795
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Let me write it down

1796
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Give me a wee piece of paper and I'll write it down

1797
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Just like this

1798
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
He kicked the hell out this cuttlefish

1799
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Literally I'm

1800
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Calamari right now

1801
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
By all accounts right let's try that again

1802
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Pump one out the chamber

1803
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Adrenaline burst health and

1804
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Double damage okay

1805
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Okay we can work with this

1806
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Four report

1807
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Two live three blank

1808
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
What do I do with that

1809
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Information

1810
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I don't know

1811
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
If three blank should I shoot

1812
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Myself

1813
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Or should I make

1814
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
The odds known if it's 50-50

1815
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Three blank two

1816
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
50-50 double damage

1817
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Let's go

1818
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
50-50 double damage

1819
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Two blanks in a row

1820
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Possibly

1821
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Oh yes

1822
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Okay

1823
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Okay

1824
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Okay

1825
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
He's gonna pump it out

1826
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Now it's back to 50-50

1827
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I'm being cuffed but I do have a blank

1828
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Yep and then one health

1829
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Damage on me

1830
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Unless he wants to use the polarizing effect

1831
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And let me win

1832
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
But that's slightly different

1833
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Okay that's good

1834
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Let him get up

1835
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Good shot

1836
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Are you squinting me right now

1837
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Cooper

1838
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Brian Blasterman

1839
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Thank you for the five Cooper

1840
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And yes I will blast the man

1841
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Okay two blank one live

1842
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I have nothing

1843
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
What's that medicine

1844
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Steelers medicine

1845
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I think I'm gonna steal his health

1846
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Prevent him from healing up

1847
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Give me that

1848
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Give me that what does it do

1849
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Why did my head just

1850
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Two blank one live

1851
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Two blank one live

1852
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Medicine is 50% chance

1853
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
One damage and two heal

1854
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Oh wait is that

1855
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
You got the good pill if it's a bad pill you'll lose health

1856
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Oops

1857
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Okay we are classic 50-50

1858
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
If we get this we have won the first round

1859
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Of double or nothing

1860
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Dealer

1861
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Oh that was a clean round

1862
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
That was a clean

1863
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Round of odds

1864
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Very clean

1865
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And on win

1866
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Okay I'm not taking medicine again

1867
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Cause I didn't realise I could hurt myself

1868
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
With it

1869
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Okay

1870
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000

Full eight 50-50

1875
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Full eight

1876
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Remove one from the chamber let me know my odds

01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Four four

1878
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Three four

1879
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Hmm

1880
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Hmm hmm

1881
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Three three

1882
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Six total

1883
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Fourth shell

1884
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Live

1885
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Ray

1886
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Can I just take his fucking heal then

1887
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Six

1888
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Four is live

1889
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Six total four is live

1890
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Six total four is live

1891
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
So I have to

1892
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It's most likely a blank

1893
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
You know that

1894
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
If four is live in that sequence

1895
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
There are most likely two blanks

1896
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Before it

1897
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Wait

1898
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Did I not take a heal

1899
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Did I not take a cigarette

1900
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I'm not being dumb

1901
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Did I not

1902
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Two is your max

1903
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
You can't over heal

1904
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Oh

1905
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Fuck

1906
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Fuck

1907
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Fucking just show

1908
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
This is not gonna work well

1909
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
No

1910
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
No

1911
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Why is he didn't polarizing

1912
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I

1913
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I suck at this game

1914
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Get let me go again

1915
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Let me go again we've got time for another

1916
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Why is this game

1917
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Ah okay soak it this shite

1918
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
The only thing I'm good for sucking is willy

1919
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Not this game

1920
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Get me in that room

1921
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Right you

1922
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Again

1923
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Please sign the waiver I consent

1924
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Your gacha look is not great

1925
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I've actually never played a gacha game

1926
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Calling a friend

1927
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Polarizing in the seat

1928
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Right I'm glad we can get a peek

1929
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Let's try this again

1930
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
It's okay

1931
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
It's okay

1932
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I'm gonna take a peek

1933
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
What do we got

1934
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Alive

1935
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I am gonna steal

1936
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
His son off and give him two damage

1937
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Now I'm aware he has a heal there

1938
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
No I'm not I'm gonna steal his heal

1939
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Your cigarettes are mine

1940
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Oh you can't over heal

1941
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
The reeflings just told you

1942
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
That mere moments ago

1943
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
That you can't over heal in this game mode

1944
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And what do you do

1945
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Reade it over heal you could have had him down to two

1946
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
You could have had him on the ropes

1947
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
But no no

1948
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Okay 50-50 odds

1949
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
He's getting insider knowledge

1950
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Did you know

1951
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
The celebrities calling the paparazzi

1952
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
To tell them ahead of time

1953
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Where they're gonna

1954
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Right

1955
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Three lives

1956
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Two

1957
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Blank

1958
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And he's gonna hurt me

1959
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Real good

1960
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Three lives two blank

1961
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Three lives two blank

1962
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Three lives two blank

1963
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
We won blank three lives

1964
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
That's right take that

1965
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
You stinky stinker

1966
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
No two lives one blank

1967
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Yeah I'm not surprised

1968
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I'm not surprised

1969
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
That's okay that's okay let him get up

1970
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Let him get up

1971
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So now there is no blank

1972
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Where

1973
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
What

1974
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
How can that not count

1975
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Now it's even again

1976
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
We're back

1977
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
We're back

1978
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Right now

1979
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
There's no blank

1980
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Yeah there's nothing now

1981
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Not gonna take that

1982
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Might use that

1983
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Double or nothing

1984
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Double or nothing

1985
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Double that dammit

1986
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Okay 50-50

1987
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It's 50-50

1988
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
What you can do is call in a pow

1989
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
It's 50-50

1990
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Let's give him the damage

1991
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Let's go let's re-inhale

1992
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
When I said re-inhale

1993
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I didn't mean like

1994
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Wind, literally all he

1995
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Felt was low

1996
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Oh man

1997
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Alright so that's blank

1998
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Very interesting

1999
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
What are you stealing

2000
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Give it back

2001
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Oh you can have that please hurt yourself with it

2002
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Oh

2003
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I'm gonna make it

2004
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I'm so bad at this game

2005
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Careful now

2006
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I'm trying to be careful

2007
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
But I suck

2008
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Okay if I eject this one

2009
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
This one's blank so I'm gonna shoot myself

2010
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I'm removing this one

2011
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
The next one is blank

2012
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
So I'm just gonna play it safe

2013
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And do that

2014
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
He is using developer luck

2015
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Remaining ammo oh my god you guys

2016
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You're trying to help me so much I'm so bad

2017
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I'm so sorry

2018
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Right we can now double spawn off at least

2019
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Why did I get two turns in a room there

2020
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Well it's now even Steven

2021
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
No it's not

2022
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
He has two health and not one

2023
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
What is he doing

2024
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Polarize him

2025
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
What are you gonna do

2026
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
No I'm so bad

2027
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Oh my goodness

2028
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
This is so hard

2029
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Yes please

2030
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Let me try again

2031
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Let me get up let me get up let me

2032
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Be very afraid

2033
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
The fourth was the blank

2034
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Yeah that's why I shot myself with it

2035
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Wow sorry this must be painful

2036
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I'm so sorry

2037
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Look I'm not very smart

2038
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
You guys didn't figure out I wasn't smart

2039
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
By playing connect 4 with me

2040
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Hang on

2041
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You know what

2042
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Yeah that's right

2043
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Call me big willy

2044
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Cause I got a big massive willy

2045
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
One

2046
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Right

2047
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Let's try hard

2048
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
It's time to try

2049
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I only got two items

2050
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Oh he only got two as well

2051
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Big willy

2052
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It's a 50-50 the game

2053
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Let's try again

2054
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
If it's a 50-50 I could just win

2055
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
By doing this

2056
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
But he can do the save

2057
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
To shoot me

2058
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
But he can still hurt me

2059
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Cause the first one wasn't

2060
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Oh if you shoot yourself

2061
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You get to play a second turn

2062
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's finally starting

2063
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
To make a little bit of sense

2064
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
But I can't over heal

2065
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So don't get jealous

2066
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Whoa why so many items

2067
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Oh he got loads of items too

2068
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Two life three blank

2069
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
No

2070
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Three blank

2071
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
No it's 50-50

2072
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
No

2073
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
It's

2074
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Oh god

2075
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I can't use my brain and talk at the same time

2076
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Just let me see what it is

2077
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Please

2078
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Okay

2079
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So if I shoot myself

2080
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I get to go again

2081
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And then I get to double shotgun

2082
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Barrel

2083
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
You

2084
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Am I doing it?

2085
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Am I doing it? I think I'm doing it

2086
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I think I'm doing it

2087
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
No

2088
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Why is my luck so poor

2089
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
There's all life now

2090
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
What does polarised do

2091
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
You could have inverted

2092
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And then sawn for the win

2093
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Wait that works backwards as well

2094
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
If I know it's blank

2095
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I need to polarise it to change it

2096
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
This must be the most painful place

2097
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Or you've ever seen

2098
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I even think we're going to be able to do it

2099
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
In time for Shibi's monetisation stream

2100
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Okay I didn't realise

2101
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Polarising swapped

2102
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Oh shit I did not pay attention

2103
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
To how many live in

2104
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
If I know it's a blank

2105
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Use polarising

2106
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Got it

2107
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
If I know it's a blank use polarising

2108
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Okay it's alive

2109
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It's alive

2110
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So

2111
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I am going to

2112
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Steal your double damage

2113
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Steal his salt

2114
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Yes I'm stealing his double damage

2115
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
If I know it's a blank

2116
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Polarise

2117
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
If I know it's a blank

2118
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Polarise

2119
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
If I know it's a blank

2120
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Polarise

2121
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
You've already finished the game

2122
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
This is infinite mode

2123
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Wait it's the same

2124
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Right he's on one health

2125
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
He's going to sawn a friend

2126
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Which is fine

2127
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
He's going to cuff me

2128
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Oh I'm zadding

2129
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Oh yeah you want to

2130
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
cuff me up

2131
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Right he's healed

2132
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Which is fine we're no one even Steven

2133
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
What was that

2134
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Adrenaline

2135
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
He's healing again

2136
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Oh you greedy

2137
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Hello

2138
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Why would you do that

2139
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Question mark

2140
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Did you mean to do that

2141
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Okay please

2142
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Take a xp

2143
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I hear a health down

2144
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Oh yeah

2145
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Oh no he's didn't polarise

2146
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Oh no

2147
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Oh no

2148
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Ow

2149
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Oh no

2150
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I don't know what it is

2151
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I don't know what's left

2152
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Oh I do know what's left

2153
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
So if I blank myself

2154
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Oh polarise

2155
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Polarise you stupid women

2156
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Polarise

2157
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Polarise

2158
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Polarise to blank

2159
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Oh my god I was so

2160
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I freaking clicked it and my brain was like

2161
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Wait a minute you were supposed to do something

2162
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Freaking polarise

2163
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Ah

2164
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Okay give me give me give me

2165
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Give me give me yeah give me yeah

2166
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Give me yeah blank

01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Right 50-50

2168
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Okay 50-50

2169
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Inspect element

2170
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Inspect element blank

2171
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Blank found

2172
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Polarise effect

2173
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Added

2174
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Polarising

2175
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And then what shoot myself or shoot him

2176
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
With polarise on

2177
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Shoot him with polarise on

2178
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Man she sure is pretty

2179
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Yeah that's all I got going for me

2180
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
This feature of model is adorable

2181
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Okay shoot him

2182
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
We did it I was so sorry

2183
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Shoot um right we did it

2184
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Willy wins fake Willy wins

2185
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Imagine if this is the run I went on

2186
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
And it's the one I call myself Willy on

2187
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Right

2188
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Okay let's see what we're working with baby

2189
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Rejection calling

2190
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And focus right

2191
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
For health on big Willy

2192
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
50-50 odds okay

2193
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
He can see he can cuff

2194
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
And he can double damage

2195
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Maybe the phone

2196
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Can tell me if

2197
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
What's first

2198
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
If not I'll just use the magnifying glass

2199
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
That's absolutely nothing

2200
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Can you not pick like

2201
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
The second bullet so I'll actually remember

2202
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Right I don't have

2203
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Polarising so I can shoot myself for free

2204
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
That's

2205
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
One

2206
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
So odds are

2207
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Shoot him

2208
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
No

2209
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Are you f**king

2210
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Kidding me

2211
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
High odds of

2212
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Being live

2213
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Literally the seventh shell is blank

2214
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So and two bullets

2215
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Have been utilised

2216
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
This is the third bullet being utilised

2217
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Right

2218
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
So

2219
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
So the odds of this one being

2220
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Live are high

2221
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Again

2222
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Oh no

2223
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Okay

2224
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Is that four

2225
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Shots now

2226
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
So then

2227
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Five and six are live

2228
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Five is live

2229
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
So

2230
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Does this game want from me

2231
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
What does this game want from me

2232
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
My odds

2233
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I know you can't rely on odds

2234
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
That's just how odds work

2235
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
My odds are

2236
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Astronomically

2237
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Right Willy's definitely

2238
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
We can't do it as Willy

2239
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
We have to go back to our roots

2240
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
We have to go back to Anon okay

2241
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Cause this clearly isn't working

2242
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It wants you to suffer

2243
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
My poor Willy

2244
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
My poor Willy got blown off

2245
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Right

2246
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I'm actually can

2247
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Pay for it

2248
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
These are good items

2249
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
What are the odds

2250
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Give me a 50-50

2251
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Okay

2252
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
We've got a 50-50

2253
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I can't overheal past two which is fine

2254
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
If it's

2255
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
50

2256
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
50

2257
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Let me see

2258
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
What's

2259
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Or eject

2260
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I might be able to

2261
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Eject 50-50

2262
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
and tell me what's up

2263
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Right taking it out alive

2264
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So if we're gonna get a blank we're gonna steal the polarizing

2265
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
No it's live

2266
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
We actually don't have a double

2267
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Oh sugar but he has

2268
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
the polarizing

2269
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Well the next to her blank

2270
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
So if he uses polarizing

2271
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Then he's one

2272
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I think

2273
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
No he can only do one damage to me

2274
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
This round

2275
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Okay okay

2276
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Steal the cuffs

2277
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I don't think that would have

2278
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Oh Andy's healing

2279
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Bro

2280
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Bro this is not looking good

2281
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Why is this game so hard

2282
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I just need you guys to like

2283
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Send me your gaming fridge

2284
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Cause this is getting so bad

2285
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Careful now

2286
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
All I've been told this game is careful now

2287
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Careful now

2288
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Careful now

2289
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yeah yeah yeah they're both blank

2290
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
We know

2291
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
We know they're blank

2292
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Well at least I have a cigarette

2293
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Right

2294
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Two live three blank

2295
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
But he doesn't have a polarizing

2296
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
So blank actually means blank in this game

2297
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I'm gonna steal his cigarette

2298
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
No

2299
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Can I get a vase

2300
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Three blank two live

2301
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Can I get a vase

2302
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So the three blank are up ahead

2303
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
So odds are this is blank

2304
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Can I steal his health

2305
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I don't want him to heal

2306
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Yeah this is blank

2307
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
It's my guess

2308
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Right this is blank sorry I'm guessing

2309
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
But yeah okay odds are

2310
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Yeah

2311
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Right I'm happy with that

2312
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Right we're gonna take a peek

2313
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Blank again

2314
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Wow

2315
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
And then the rest are

2316
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Live two live in a room

2317
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Well unfortunately he's gonna get

2318
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
A lick in on me

2319
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
How do I suck so badly

2320
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I'm not being funny

2321
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I'm getting absolutely

2322
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I'm getting

2323
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Just

2324
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
They're making a mockery out of me

2325
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
They're making an absolute mockery out of me

2326
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Does this guy even have a name

2327
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Okay phone a friend

2328
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Adrenaline

2329
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Oh he got a heal I'm gonna steal his heal

2330
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Right it's a 50-50

2331
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Let me start comboing the items

2332
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Oh I'm too dumb for that though

2333
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
That actually feels like

2334
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Injection into

2335
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
That puts adrenaline into your heart

2336
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Which basically forces it to go

2337
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Like I'm just shooting

2338
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
So anyway I start blasting

2339
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Cause I'm unable to

2340
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Keep up with them

2341
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Oh wait I actually won out of

2342
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Just pure frustration

2343
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
We won that round anyway

2344
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Starts blasting

2345
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
We did it we made it to round two

2346
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Of double or nothing

2347
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I've still yet to make it

2348
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
To round three

2349
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Okay let's see what we get

2350
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Cuff

2351
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Double damage

2352
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Not medicine

2353
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Medicine that's not really medicine

2354
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Too blind

2355
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Does he have a polarizer he does

2356
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Phone in a friend

2357
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Wow

2358
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Steel

2359
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Polarizer

2360
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Shoot him

2361
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Steel Polarizer shoot him

2362
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Yes

2363
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Steel Polarizer

2364
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Shoot him

2365
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And then shoot

2366
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Okay then he'll shoot

2367
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Blank on me

2368
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Cause we know it doesn't have

2369
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Anything in it

2370
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And then double sawing off

2371
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Oh he's healing

2372
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
So let him shoot

2373
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It's just fine cause it's blank

2374
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Oh for god he can get an extra turn

2375
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Efficient himself

2376
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I keep forgetting the mechanics

2377
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Of this dumb game

2378
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Why is it he is allowed to heal

2379
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And he's allowed to do this

2380
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And he's allowed to do that

2381
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Don't you know the video game rules

2382
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Only I'm supposed to be able

2383
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
To do all the things that help me

2384
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Win the game

2385
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Wow

2386
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I never thought that far ahead

2387
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I never thought in the first place

2388
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
That should be my sentence

2389
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I don't think

2390
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Right what was that 50-50

2391
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Right at least we can heal first

2392
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Watch your enemies hand close

2393
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Bro

2394
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Hordeshell library

2395
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
That gives me nothing thank you

2396
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Let me again

2397
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
What's in the chamber

2398
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Blank

2399
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I don't have a polarizer

2400
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
So I can officially shoot myself

2401
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Bunk

2402
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Right and then

2403
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
And then what

2404
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I mean that means odds are

2405
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
It's a double

2406
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Cuff him

2407
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Okay and then what

2408
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And then

2409
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
What I can do is just guess

2410
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I'll say it from this one

2411
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
So what's this the third

2412
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Wow

2413
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
This is why I don't gamble

2414
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I have no interest in gambling

2415
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I have no interest in playing Genshin Impact

2416
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Because it's a gamba game or something like that

2417
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
I actually don't know if Genshin Impact is a gamba game

2418
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
But yeah

2419
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Remaining ammo inside

2420
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
You're trying to help me and it doesn't help

2421
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Because I'm so dumb it doesn't help

2422
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I'm too dumb to be helped

2423
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
You guys are just

2424
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Gonna have to send in your gameplay and I'll commentate over

2425
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
And pretend that I'm playing

2426
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
That seems like a plan

2427
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Surely

2428
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I'm not I'm losing it

2429
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Right

2430
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
New round

2431
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Let's see what we're working with

2432
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Two lives three blank

2433
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
A burner

2434
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Just show me if it's good or bad

2435
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
It's good

2436
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I don't have a polarizer though

2437
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Clink

2438
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
And there's four in the chamber left

2439
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
So let's talk to the phone

2440
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Because they say, listen

2441
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Okay

2442
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
That means the odds have increased

2443
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
That this is a live round

2444
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
So we're gonna say funk it

2445
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
And

2446
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
We start splasting

2447
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Yes

2448
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Okay we know next is blank

2449
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
He doesn't

2450
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
He doesn't have a polarizer either

2451
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Oh

2452
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Good or bad

2453
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
We know this is blank

2454
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
But we know that this is live

2455
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And now he knows it's live

2456
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
And he's got a double

2457
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
It's ogre

2458
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
It's ogre

2459
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
He's cuffing me bro

2460
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Wait what

2461
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Now it's live

2462
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Oh my goodness golly

2463
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
This game if you are

2464
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Like me in small brain

2465
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
This game ain't for you

2466
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I got one more in the tank

2467
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Because she be getting ready to go live

2468
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
We got one more

2469
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Come on

2470
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
That's it you know what

2471
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I'm writing down

2472
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
This freaking piece of paper

2473
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
What the heck is going on in this game

2474
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I'm gonna call in

2475
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
This freaking

2476
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I'm gonna call in the big guns

2477
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Which is me writing on a piece of paper

2478
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
To write down the odds

2479
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
To write down what there is

2480
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
To write down what to do

2481
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
If we do not win this one

2482
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
This settles it

2483
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
That you guys are just far too smart for me

2484
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And you have picked the most

2485
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Are worded oh she

2486
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
There possibly could be in all the lines

2487
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Right pull out items

2488
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Magnifying glass

2489
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Health

2490
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
No don't want meds

2491
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I'm not taking my meds

2492
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
You can't convince me

2493
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Right what's in the chamber

2494
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Two live

2495
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Three

2496
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Lang

2497
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And then I'm gonna do it like hangman

2498
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
On my piece of paper

2499
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
So the odds

2500
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Are already

2501
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Not the best

2502
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I am going to

2503
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Seal

2504
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
His phone

2505
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
I'm gonna steal his phone

2506
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
No

2507
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Yes

2508
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Yes I'm going to

2509
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
To steal his phone to get the intel

2510
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Fifth shell blank

2511
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Okay so for hangman there's now a B

2512
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
On the fifth one

2513
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
For blank

2514
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
We are going to see what's inside

2515
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Cause either way we're doing damage to this round

2516
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It's a blank so we're going to

2517
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Apply the polarizing effect

2518
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
We're gonna put B on the first hangman

2519
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Section as well

2520
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
So we're polarizing

2521
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
To make it hurt

2522
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
The dealer is being shot

2523
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
With the polarizing effect

2524
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Resulting damage to the dealer

2525
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Okay

2526
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Okay

2527
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
So first one's blank, last one's blank

2528
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
We now know this, that's perfectly fine

2529
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
We're lint

2530
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
All it took was writing it down on a piece of paper

2531
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And playing hangman

2532
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Neither am I, that's why we're playing hangman

2533
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
He is now inspecting

2534
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
He claims the contents

2535
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Are very interesting

2536
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
He shoots me with a live

2537
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Round so the second position

2538
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Is live

2539
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
We are now on a 50-50

2540
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
On the contents of the gun

2541
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Being live or blank, we cannot ascertain

2542
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
We can heal up

2543
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
But we cannot ascertain

2544
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
What is inside

2545
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
This truly is a 50-50

2546
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
He drank a beer

2547
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
What did I miss it?

2548
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Two and three were live

2549
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
The blank, wait

2550
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
But none of us have a polarizer

2551
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
So this round can't be complete

2552
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
So we need to start a new

2553
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Freaking round in hangman game

2554
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Goodness gravy

2555
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
All blanks

2556
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Okay, okay, okay

2557
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
A BBL

2558
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
No I didn't get a BBL but thanks for asking baby

2559
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Right

2560
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Let's play hangman over again

2561
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Let me, what is the ratio

2562
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Three live, four blank

2563
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Three live, four

2564
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Blank

2565
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
For a total of seven on hangman

2566
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
One, two, three, four, five

2567
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Seven

2568
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I have adrenaline to call in

2569
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
For information

2570
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Which we're going to do

2571
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Right, you can yoink the yoink

2572
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Right, position

2573
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Second shell, blank

2574
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Hangman, second is B, blank

2575
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Oh sugar, I just dropped my pencil

2576
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
If we handcuff

2577
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
And we are going to act like

2578
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
The first one is live

2579
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Okay

2580
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
We are going to treat it as live

2581
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
We do not know and we cannot ascertain

2582
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
If that information is true or not

2583
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
However, we can shoot ourselves for

2584
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Okay, that was a blank

2585
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
So first two are filled out B's

2586
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
That leaves

2587
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Two blank and three live on the board

2588
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
We are going to shoot ourselves

2589
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
To give ourselves another round

2590
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Sadly

2591
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
There are now five

2592
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Pieces remaining

2593
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
And we cannot ascertain

2594
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
The knowledge, so we're going to treat it

2595
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
As alive, this truly is a 50-50

2596
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
We're going to treat it as alive

2597
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Because odds are it's alive

2598
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
You know what, I'm just going to go fuck myself then

2599
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
You know what, because that's the thing with odds

2600
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
That is the thing with odds

2601
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
That is the thing

2602
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
With odds

2603
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Yeah

2604
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
It could literally, you can flip a coin

2605
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
10 times in a row and statistically

2606
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Never get hits 10 times in a row

2607
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
But that's the thing with odds

2608
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
They are not reality

2609
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2610
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2611
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
That's, right, another

2612
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Sorry, I'm addicted

2613
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I'm addicted, I like this approach

2614
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Sorry, the hangman approach is quite fun

2615
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I'm addicted, I can't stop

2616
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
She beats up in 10 minutes

2617
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
We've got 10 minutes to speak on this

2618
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Come on

2619
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
10 minutes

2620
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Oh my god, come on, come on

2621
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Please save the waiver

2622
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I will, anything for you dealer

2623
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Again, again, again, again

2624
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Okay

2625
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Who goes there?

2626
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Identify yourself

2627
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
3 life, 4 blank

2628
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
3 life, 4 blank

2629
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
7 hangman

2630
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Okay

2631
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
We have adrenaline

2632
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
We are going to get intel

2633
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
from this adrenaline

2634
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I assume you can only use adrenaline once per round

2635
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Right, the intel is

2636
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
The intel is third shell life route

2637
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Okay

2638
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Can we do double adrenaline?

2639
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Hello

2640
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Double adrenaline

2641
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
That's cheating

2642
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Blank, shit, we need, oh we have a polarizer

2643
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Okay, that's perfect

2644
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
If we handcuff

2645
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Or does that leave

2646
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
That's 2 life on the board

2647
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
We don't know about 3 life on the board

2648
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
We don't know about

2649
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Tell you what we could do

2650
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Handcuff

2651
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Polarize

2652
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Shoot

2653
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Discard

2654
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
The current unknown

2655
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Because we don't know what it is

2656
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
We don't know what it is

2657
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
And I don't trust it

2658
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
So we're just going to discard it

2659
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Okay, we're just going to discard it

2660
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
It doesn't really matter

2661
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Okay, so we can write down blank in second

2662
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
So now there's 2 blank and 2 life

2663
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
The odds are straight back to 50-50 again

2664
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
We are going to shoot

2665
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Okay, okay

2666
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
So now there's 1 blank remaining

2667
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
And 2 live on the board

2668
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Hmm

2669
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I'm going to eject a blank

2670
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
So all remaining are now live

2671
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Shit

2672
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
And he's going to do 3 health damage

2673
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
In the sequence

2674
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Wait

2675
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Yeah, no, yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry

2676
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Then blank was the 5th there

2677
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
And then it's 2 live remaining now

2678
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Sorry, my apologies

2679
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
2 live remaining

2680
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Okay

2681
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Unfortunately, he will get a lick in on us

2682
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
But that's fine, that's fine

2683
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Do you feel so big brain now?

2684
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
No, I'm cheating by playing Hangman

2685
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
And writing it down, that's how hard this game is

2686
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
For me to conceptualize it in my head

2687
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I cannot do this

2688
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
In an abstract

2689
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Concept

2690
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I don't have the ability to do this

2691
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I have to write everything down, it has to be physical

2692
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
In front of me

2693
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
We've got 2 insights

2694
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Fantastic

2695
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Oh

2696
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I'm not going to do it for this round

2697
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Umm

2698
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
He's got a polarizer?

2699
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
No he doesn't

2700
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I might as well shoot then

2701
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Shouldn't I?

2702
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
There's no point in using this stuff

2703
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
It's a 50-50, I might as well just shoot

2704
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
There's no point

2705
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
I've got 2 phones

2706
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
1 for the velar, no use the phone

2707
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
No get info

2708
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on

2709
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
What's the point in me using the phone

2710
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Right now, because it's 50-50

2711
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
If it's a blank

2712
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Oh wait, yeah

2713
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Idiot, if it's a blank then he can't get a licking on me

2714
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Sorry

2715
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Sorry

2716
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Sorry, I'm a bit slow

2717
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I'm a bit slow

2718
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I'm so sorry

2719
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I'm so slow

2720
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
It takes me a moment to remember

2721
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
The way this game plays

2722
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I'm so sorry

2723
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Okay

2724
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
We are on to the second round

2725
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Yay

2726
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay

2727
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Big brain time

2728
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Can you feel the wrinkles

2729
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
becoming more wrinkly in your brain?

2730
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Your smooth piece of

2731
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
chicken breast brain is now

2732
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
magnifying

2733
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
3 live, 3 blank

2734
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
3 live, 3 blank

2735
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Okay

2736
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Insider knowledge, yes please

2737
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Third shell, blank

2738
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Okay

2739
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Adrenaline

2740
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Yonkers

2741
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I would like insider knowledge from the adrenaline

2742
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
burst

2743
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Okay

2744
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
What are you going to tell me?

2745
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Fourth shell, blank

2746
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Okay

2747
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Now

2748
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
That leaves one blank

2749
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Unknown

2750
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
The odds

2751
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
is now one in four of the current

2752
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
shell in the chamber being a blank

2753
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I think I want to shoot

2754
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
So anyway

2755
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I start blasting

2756
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
The odds of one in four

2757
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Yep, okay

2758
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
That's what I like to see

2759
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Live one in four

2760
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
We are going

2761
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Okay, he's going to heal up

2762
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
That's perfectly fine

2763
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
He is going to be able to see what's inside

2764
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And he does have a polarizer

2765
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
So I'm going to have to be cautious of that

2766
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
He's going to check it out

2767
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
What do you see?

2768
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Very interesting

2769
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Okay

2770
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Oh he's shooting, it's alive

2771
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Okay

2772
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
So the next two we know are blank

2773
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
So we can

2774
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Blank it up to high heavens, okay

2775
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Blank

2776
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Bonk

2777
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
And then blank again

2778
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Thanks to our insider knowledge

2779
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I can't believe it, hangman works

2780
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
And blank again

2781
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Then we are going to drink the beer

2782
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
To inject the second last bullet

2783
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Because we will be able to

2784
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
If this is blank

2785
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Or if it's live

2786
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So that was live

2787
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
So that means the remaining one

2788
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Is blank

2789
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
So we can just shoot ourselves

2790
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Bonk, okay

2791
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
All good, all good in the hood

2792
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
New round

2793
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
We do

2794
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Insider

2795
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
The game knows we are playing hangman

2796
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
The game knows

2797
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
What we got, 4 live

2798
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
4 blank

2799
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
4 live

2800
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
4 blank

2801
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Hangman, 1, 2, 3

2802
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Okay I don't have enough room on the paper

2803
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

2804
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Sorry I need to re-write that

2805
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
That really awkward bit

2806
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Right

2807
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Give me the

2808
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
What's the update

2809
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Let us know what's going on here

2810
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
3rd shell

2811
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Live, perfect

2812
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Let me know what else is going down

2813
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Obliet

2814
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
I didn't realise he could do that

2815
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
I didn't know he could do that

2816
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Like thanks

2817
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Right I'm going to

2818
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Judgement, I'm still going to take this

2819
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Because it's so much better and more valuable

2820
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
To know what's coming up

2821
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
5th shell, live, okay

2822
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Okay, okay, okay

2823
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
We only don't know where 2 are

2824
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
That leads me to believe

2825
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
So the odds are now

2826
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
What

2827
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
1 in 3

2828
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
That this is blank

2829
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
No, that's not

2830
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
That's not correct

2831
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I want to shoot myself

2832
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Against my better judgement

2833
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I'm going to claim this as a blank

2834
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Because statistically it should be

2835
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
We did it

2836
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Okay we have a second round now

2837
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
There are

2838
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
3

2839
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Blank

2840
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
What does this mean

2841
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Cigarettes

2842
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I can't heal up I don't think

2843
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
In Minecraft

2844
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
In Minecraft

2845
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Unknown

2846
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
2nd live

2847
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I don't know

2848
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Shit or not, your max is HP

2849
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
4, oh is it sorry

2850
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Let's have a wee quick siggy break

2851
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
We'll start all over this

2852
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Thank you, sorry, my apologies

2853
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I thought this was like you couldn't heal it

2854
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
A 4, 4, 4

2855
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Should we get a cigarette, smoker and gen 2

2856
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Apparently that's a really big

2857
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Kink

2858
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
That I didn't know about

2859
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
You know a wham and smokes a siggy

2860
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
No, I don't know what it's going to be

2861
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
You know what

2862
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
If I shoot myself

2863
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
It's actually going to not be that bad

2864
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Okay, we know this one is live

2865
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
So we can shoot

2866
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Oh no a double shot

2867
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Shit

2868
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I get so excited to like

2869
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Utilize

2870
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
We would have gone on to the next round

2871
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
We would have gone on to the next round

2872
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
If I wasn't so freaking quick

2873
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Shorty

2874
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Okay, he just ejected a live

2875
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
So it's live, live, live actually

2876
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Wait what

2877
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Oh

2878
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Thanks for letting me go to the other round

2879
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Even though I messed up

2880
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I appreciate you dealer

2881
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
The game must know I'm like sweating so hard

2882
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
We finally made it

2883
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
To round 3

2884
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Okay

2885
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Hangman ain't got nothing on us

2886
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Okay

2887
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Medicine

2888
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Polarize

2889
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
That's very

2890
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
That's fine

2891
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
2 blank

2892
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
3 blank sorry

2893
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Sorry number

2894
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
We have no insider

2895
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Information at all

2896
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
We have odds which is blank

2897
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
The odds stipulate

2898
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
This is a blank so I shouldn't theory

2899
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Put the polarizing on

2900
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
And shoot myself

2901
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
We have to go with odds

2902
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
We have no choice

2903
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
The dealer with polarizer on

2904
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
So that was a blank

2905
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
So now it's 2-2

2906
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
50-50 perfect and he can see what's inside

2907
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Very interesting

2908
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Live

2909
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Okay

2910
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
The odds are now 1 live, 2 blank

2911
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Wow

2912
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
If I take the medicine I expire

2913
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Because my odds are not good enough

2914
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
This is it

2915
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I either win this game mode

2916
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Or I lose it on whatever we pick

2917
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Refling's

2918
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Now the odds are this is blank

2919
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Swallow the medicine

2920
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I'll swallow it because you asked

2921
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Me to refling

2922
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Ah

2923
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Refling

2924
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Forever time because she be live

2925
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
With celebration

2926
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
It was worth it though

2927
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I died doing what I love the most

2928
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Guzzling refling's ink

2929
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
I perished doing what I love the most

2930
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Okay

2931
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
So I don't feel that bad

2932
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
So good that was fantastic

2933
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I can 100% see us

2934
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Revisiting this game in a membership stream

2935
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I don't like replaying games

2936
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I may have already done before

2937
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
But thank you so so much

2938
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
For that fantastic

2939
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Experience on this game

2940
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Another 10 out of 10 game

2941
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Shout out to the developer

2942
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
That is like such a fun little odds game

2943
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
So goofy, incredibly entertaining

2944
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
And the graphics

2945
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
As well as the design

2946
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Visual design

2947
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Is absolutely beautiful

2948
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Some people might not enjoy

2949
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
The poly

2950
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Looking art

2951
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I can't remember what the art style

2952
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Art style is the word I'm looking for

2953
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
The art style

2954
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Right, we are going to

2955
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Redirect into none other

2956
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Than she be

2957
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Cotton bum for her

2958
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Saikam

2959
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Membership monetization

2960
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Celebration, wherever the

2961
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Frick diddle-a-dack

2962
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I am going to

2963
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Make sure I am redirecting into her

2964
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
But that was fantastic

2965
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Thank you so much for playing that game with me

2966
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
That was so good

2967
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
We will definitely hangman this game

2968
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
At a later date

2969
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Because gosh golly gee

2970
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
That was just amazing

2971
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
We finally started

2972
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
It started to click at the end

2973
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
I need to redirect into Sheepsters

2974
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Because that didn't work properly

2975
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Thank god I checked

2976
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Right, all good in the hood

2977
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I think

2978
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Yes, thank you so so much Reeflings

2979
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I will see you

2980
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
You, yes you

2981
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
For an ASMR stream

2982
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
At the regular time

2983
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
And then 15 minutes later

2984
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I will swap all my equipment back

2985
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
To my regular streaming equipment

2986
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
And we will have a membership watch

2987
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Along of Transformers

2988
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
And don't be greedy, see that

2989
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Don't be a naughty Reefling

2990
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
And see that, okay? Thank you so so much

2991
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
For hanging out, that was absolutely amazing game

2992
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
And I will see you

2993
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Giffy Gibbers

2994
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Pardon me as I burp my cola up

2995
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Tomorrow, my little Reeflings

2996
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
We'll do it all over again

2997
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Okay, say hi to Sheeby for me

2998
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Bye Reeflings, I love you

2999
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Say hi Sheeby, right now
