1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
What is that noise? It sounds like the fire.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,680
Oh, there we go.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,920
Oh, he's like, this world is free.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Oh, this is too early.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Three, he believes it.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Right.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,920
Obviously, I've jumped into the game.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Oh, wait a minute.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Oh, wait, can I hear myself?

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Oh, wait, can I hear myself?

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Oh, wait, I can't hear myself.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Jeez.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Get the door.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Get the door.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Mama.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Mummy's here.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Uh, I'm going to open.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Um...

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Hi, good morning. Good evening.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Good afternoon.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Uh, how is that all fit to scale?

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Oh, wait, that doesn't fit to scale at all, Runelight.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Is that like that last stream?

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
It doesn't... wait, why is this on top of the freaking thing?

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,920
No, don't do that. That's even worse.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Go below.

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Why is there two Runelights?

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Do I have the game captures myself?

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Okay, no, that looks correct.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,920
I just need to do that.

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Okay, Rinscape is just a funny-shaped game, okay?

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
It's going to be scoff.

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
It's just a funny-shaped game.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm too dumb for to figure out.

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Is that a refling?

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Refling, you already in?

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Other player has accepted?

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm like, damn, Reflings, you're quick.

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
We are in world high...

40
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Oh, it's replays.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Hi, uh, red e-fling.

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
That's how I spell it.

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Damn, Reflings are shown off.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
I'm not even freaking said like,

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
oh, this is my update for today.

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,920
No way, they have freaking Gangnam style

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
and freaking Rinscape 07.

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Old school.

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
I don't know why I said 07 though.

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Oh, my Gangnam style.

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Uh-oh.

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Sexy refling.

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Open them Gangnam style.

55
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Howdy-ow.

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Good morning, good evening,

57
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
and good after noon.

58
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
I hope you guys are ready

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,920
for a cheeky endurance stream.

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Hi, Reflings. Hi, Strone, I guess.

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Uh, yeah, I hope you're ready

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
for a cheeky endurance today.

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Um, I...

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
had a bit of business

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
going on behind the scenes

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
business, business, business.

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
So, uh, I hope to have

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
quite a fun update soon.

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
I've just told the girls what the business was,

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
and, uh,

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
someone's very excited.

72
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
I just read their message,

73
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
but it made me giggle,

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
but I can't say or else spoilers.

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Let me open up my inventory

76
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
so you guys can see what's up.

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Yes, we are business, business, business.

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,920
We're doing, like, straight-up business, business, business.

79
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Um, like, I'm...

80
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
The only thing I'm used to is

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
sponsorship people reaching out to me

82
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
and being like, hey, for a 60-second segment,

83
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
I will pay you this much.

84
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
This is what is going on.

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Um, and then I'm just like...

86
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Oh, yeah.

87
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
But this time,

88
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
um,

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
I got...

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
I will talk about it a bit more.

91
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
I'm gonna ask permission if I can talk about it,

92
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
because, um, the person is associated

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
with an agency that helped out to...

94
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
and if they're comfortable with it,

95
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
I'm happy to talk about, obviously, nothing.

96
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Azur got monetized?

97
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Are you telling me Azur got monetized?

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
I went to bed and Azur wasn't monetized.

99
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Shibi was, which made me think

100
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
within 24 hours Azur is getting reviewed next.

101
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
I just hope her massive fucking

102
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
honkers don't, uh...

103
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Uh...

104
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
I know

105
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
DEMPA isn't

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
in here right now.

107
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
DEMPA's just messaged me.

108
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
She's...

109
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
strong angry. You have a lot on your plate.

110
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Do you think Ace of the Masters?

111
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
What do you need, DEMPA?

112
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
I won't charge.

113
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
DEMPA, I won't charge, darling.

114
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Oh, DEMPA,

115
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
you're so adorable.

116
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Never charge friends.

117
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Always do it for free because

118
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
when you have friends like these,

119
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
life is good.

120
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
I have not even known DEMPA

121
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
for more than two weeks

122
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
and she's been nothing but a sweetheart to me.

123
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Right, I am going to go to the bank

124
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
and clear out all my fishes in the background

125
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
whilst I ramble to you.

126
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I have absolutely terrible news.

127
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Just...

128
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
upshot news.

129
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I tried to take a Joby,

130
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
but the Joby wouldn't have come.

131
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
So...

132
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
I'm probably going to have to take a big steamer

133
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
in the middle of the stream

134
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
which I'm raging

135
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
because I hate...

136
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
I'll always go for a shower

137
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
after I do a big

138
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Joby

139
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
because I can't... wait, should I just make a...

140
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
I think it would actually be faster.

141
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Hold on, Reflens. I think it's going to be faster

142
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
if I take wood out and

143
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
I...

144
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Do I even have wood?

145
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Do I even have an axe?

146
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
It must... I do have an axe.

147
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Okay, then I need a

148
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
tinderbox.

149
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Okay.

150
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
I don't actually have a bit of wood.

151
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Right, that's fine though. We're going to go get it.

152
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Right, we'll chop here

153
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
and then I'm going to make a fire outside the bank for now

154
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
just to eliminate

155
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
all of my inventory.

156
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Oh, juice.

157
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Oh, tiny cuttles

158
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
wants to trade with you.

159
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
What's your name?

160
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Well, baby cuttles.

161
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Um...

162
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Hi. Oh, you already given me one.

163
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Thank you.

164
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Yes, I will be needing these. Thank you very much.

165
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Little easy.

166
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
The best way to ruin friendship is get money

167
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
involved.

168
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
I went until I learned

169
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
about the development team drama.

170
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Oh my god!

171
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
I've got a really funny fucking comment.

172
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
So, you know how I'm always telling you about

173
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
like, oh, we...

174
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
All I have on hand for wood right now

175
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
your wood is

176
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
more than enough.

177
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Little roofling, I assure you.

178
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
A winky face, because we all know

179
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
what we're talking about.

180
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Um...

181
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
I'm a mor... Oh, damn, bullshit!

182
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I was talking about you!

183
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Um...

184
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm so scared.

185
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
I never streamed on YouTube.

186
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Oh, you don't actually have to mod anything.

187
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
It's like customary to make you

188
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
mod

189
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
so that

190
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
you stand out more in chat.

191
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
DEMPA, I'm so sorry.

192
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
I was just exposing you. I just said

193
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
that you wanted an ASMR script

194
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
and I'm offering it for free, because I would never charge you for that.

195
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
You're...

196
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Oh, freaking sick. I'm just not...

197
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Wait, let me pick up... I'm doing two things.

198
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Right, let me finish up the...

199
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Why did that only take out one?

200
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Oh, it's not looking good.

201
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Now you all know that I'm a RuneScape noob.

202
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Oh, yeah, YouTube custom.

203
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Yes, you're learning, right?

204
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Use Tinder Box on the logs.

205
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Oh my god, you got a little cabbage head going on.

206
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Okay, right.

207
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Oh, I don't want to brag, but I'm level 2

208
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
if I'm making... Right, we are going to just get rid of...

209
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Not rid of, but...

210
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
But yeah, you don't...

211
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Yeah, so, as I was saying,

212
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
we got a little hate comment today on YouTube.

213
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
But do you want to know why it's so funny?

214
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
It's because

215
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
most of the comments were like,

216
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
vealers aren't going to last a month.

217
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
And then it went to two months

218
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
and it went to six months.

219
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Do you want to know what today's hate comment

220
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
and quotation marks was that I had to delete

221
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
vealers aren't going to last

222
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
two years.

223
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Motherfucker, if vealers last

224
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
two years, all three generations

225
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
are successfully out.

226
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I don't... What?

227
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Are you dumb?

228
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
I like how it went from not even going to last

229
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
a week, not even going to last a month.

230
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Two years? Two years, all three genes are out.

231
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Two years and I have succeeded

232
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
in what I wanted to do.

233
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Duh.

234
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
I literally just like multiplied the time

235
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
dramatically.

236
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
And literally, it's a supportive message.

237
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
I'm like, nice try, but

238
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
bruv, wait, sorry. I think a re-film is trying

239
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
to trade me. Sorry.

240
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Sorry.

241
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
I'm sorry, bruv, yet it didn't mean to not trade you.

242
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
What?

243
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
10,000

244
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
swordfish? Isn't that not like

245
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
99 right there? Am I going crazy?

246
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Are you sure?

247
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Oh my god.

248
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh my god.

249
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Wait, wait, wait.

250
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Another reflin?

251
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Uh...

252
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Oh no.

253
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Oh my god, reflin.

254
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Alright, I'm getting drunk.

255
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
I'm getting drunk as a skunk.

256
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Actually, I think we're doing

257
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
drunk stream near the end.

258
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Helps make the job a...

259
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
I literally

260
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
got like freaking 10 kabillion.

261
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Right, thank you. Let's go for a job.

262
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Let me drink that. Let me eat.

263
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Oh, I love the little bubble

264
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
sound effect. If I ever make a song,

265
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
like an actual song, like custom made song,

266
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
oh my god, 10,000 swordfish.

267
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Oh my gosh.

268
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Right, in order

269
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
to make this super simple,

270
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm so sorry for anyone

271
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
who like is really good at organizing their

272
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
shit.

273
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I'm not. I'm literally just going to shove

274
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
all the fish items to the top.

275
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Please don't judge me.

276
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Please don't judge me.

277
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Right, I'm pretty sure that's all the shit.

278
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Raw trout, you as well.

279
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Raw herring, you as well.

280
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
And that's cooked salmon.

281
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
God, what a bank.

282
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Gee willikers, I sure hope no one cracks

283
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
into a skullfish.

284
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
If you move to members later, it'll get

285
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
faster. One morban, literally.

286
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Right, shrimp. We're going to

287
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
call the shrimp right now. Unless the fire

288
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
is out, I think the fire is out.

289
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Wait, no, someone's lighting the beacon.

290
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Gondor calls for aid.

291
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
We're just going to clean up our inventory.

292
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I say that as if we didn't just get 10,000

293
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
freaking fish. Thank you very much.

294
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Does me, I'm glad I could help.

295
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Thank you. Bank tabs and shambles.

296
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm so sorry. I know people are

297
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
really good at organizing their tabs.

298
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
I just couldn't, I'm just like, in and out.

299
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Let's go. She's a hoarder.

300
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
But she's our hoarder.

301
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Visucky

302
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
is done for. They can't compete with

303
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
velour, literally.

304
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
I bet you velour won't last until

305
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
velour stuff exists in.

306
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Isn't it interesting?

307
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Look at me right now.

308
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Valia might only last

309
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
two years, but that's still a year.

310
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
22 months, 30

311
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
days, 23 hours,

312
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
59 minutes and 59

313
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
seconds longer than he probably lasts

314
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
when he touches a woman.

315
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Bro, literally, oh wait,

316
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, did you just

317
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
did you just roast him?

318
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Thank you for the tip, Toria.

319
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
I was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, until

320
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
I heard the very last sentence.

321
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
I was like, a Brian?

322
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Brian?

323
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Oh my gosh.

324
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
That was,

325
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
I didn't expect that at all.

326
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Right, I can put this away because there's a kind of rifle

327
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
in making fires. Right.

328
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
We'll do anchovies.

329
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
We'll do

330
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
the...

331
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
No, don't eat. Oh wait, they're cooked.

332
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Okay.

333
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
My apologies, such a fake gamer for

334
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
I cannot, oh my god,

335
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
really starting a freaking fire outside the bank.

336
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
Wait a minute.

337
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm not the Rockwell uprising.

338
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Like, I was naughty.

339
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I'm not there all the time.

340
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
I'll be honest, I'll put my hand up

341
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
and I'll say I'm not there all the time.

342
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
I had a little peek yesterday

343
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
about what you've all been

344
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
anonymously chatting about

345
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
and someone said,

346
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
yes, Trony, I understand

347
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Blackwell

348
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
headquarters.

349
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
And I was like,

350
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
that's so fucking funny.

351
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
So yeah, your comment got me excited.

352
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
I was seeing someone,

353
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
someone's like, a ritual

354
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
posting about Shibi and it's like, I am nothing but trash.

355
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm just Shibi's foot and I'm like, yes, yes, yes.

356
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Then the OG

357
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Sons, those Czech and the OG Sons

358
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
they were spoiling I see.

359
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Absolutely spoiling it.

360
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
He's throwing it off topic question.

361
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
What's your tip for Germany,

362
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Scotland today?

363
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Is there a football match on?

364
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Use logs on fire to make bonfire.

365
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
We'll not go out.

366
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Isn't that all RuneScape 3?

367
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
I don't think that's a thing here.

368
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
What about having many fires?

369
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Hmm.

370
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Any thoughts on doing

371
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Iron Man so chat can't just give you everything?

372
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
VBop

373
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
You have far too much faith in me.

374
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

375
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I know I'm not supposed to

376
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
name chatters

377
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,920
but my guy

378
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
you have far too much faith in me to think that I could do

379
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
the only way I could do this on my own

380
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
is by picking up

381
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
dropped fish and barbarian village.

382
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
That is the only way I know how to do it

383
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
because I don't have the funds.

384
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
I don't know how to make money in this game

385
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
and we'd be at this for hours.

386
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Since strong debut,

387
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
something about her reminded me of a Pokemon.

388
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
It has been on the tip of my tongue

389
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
for an entire week

390
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
and I finally figured it looks like a

391
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Cray Dilly if it was an anime girl.

392
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
A Cray Dilly?

393
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Hold on, you're actually getting me to look up something.

394
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Cray Dilly Pokemon.

395
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Cray Dilly Pokemon.

396
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
Oh,

397
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
I know them.

398
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
They're in Ruby.

399
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Kill things to make money.

400
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Bro, goblins don't drop money.

401
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
The most expensive item

402
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
goblins drop is goblin mail

403
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
which is 500 a piece purely because it's a quest item.

404
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Thank you Thierry for the other tip as well.

405
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Honestly, I could see that.

406
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Yeah, the fossil type.

407
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
Goblins are the best.

408
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
You're trolling me.

409
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
I'm getting trolled.

410
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
There's no way you guys actually think that.

411
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
I got my first bond via marbles on stream.

412
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
I wish you could do marbles on stream

413
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
on

414
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
thingy.

415
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
On YouTube.

416
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
But things are very slowly getting

417
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
integrated to YouTube.

418
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
But I

419
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
definitely feel YouTube

420
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
is becoming stronger and stronger

421
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
for streamers.

422
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
And like,

423
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
I think what we're saying

424
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
is that discoverability, who

425
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
dare add it.

426
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
DEMPA!

427
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
I don't know if you're still lurking.

428
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
DEMPA goes, I didn't think that far ahead.

429
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
What do you think would be cute?

430
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
I think she likes the kind of creature it is.

431
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
I'll write some creepy stuff for you.

432
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
You were strong and we were rooting for Scotland

433
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
today in the years. Oh, we're gonna do shit.

434
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
It's fine, it's fine.

435
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
The life of a Scottish

436
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
national...

437
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Wait, no, hold on.

438
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
Nationality of a Scottish person.

439
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Because we understand we're just terrible.

440
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Although we're decent at rugby.

441
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
I'll be honest, we're actually no rough at rugby.

442
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
But the fit ball.

443
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
The fit ball, if you didn't know

444
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
football in Scotland,

445
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
you say fit, like F-I-T.

446
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
But no pronunciation on the T.

447
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
And then ball, fit ball.

448
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Okay.

449
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I feel like

450
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
YouTube could make discoverability so much better.

451
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
See, I think it does

452
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
enough. It's Twitch that has poor

453
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
discoverability. However,

454
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
people disagree with me when I say that.

455
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
And I'm like, oh, okay.

456
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
I actually thought

457
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Shawnee literally never leaves

458
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
her arms until she makes

459
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
her display.

460
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Born blue, thank you

461
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
for becoming a member.

462
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Enjoy the emotes back.

463
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
The girls emotes have been ordered.

464
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I do have a bit of bad news

465
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
about it though. The person

466
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
that I get them done by, they're like

467
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
it'll take me a month. And I'm like

468
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
excuse me?

469
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
A month? And they're like, yeah, a month.

470
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Is that okay? And I'm like, hehe

471
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I guess.

472
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
And then they're like, oh

473
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
but we've also put the base price up.

474
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
And I'm like, oh, okay then.

475
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Okay, that's fine then.

476
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
And I'm like, okay.

477
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
That's just kind of the worst of all worlds.

478
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
But yeah.

479
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Everyone else

480
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
is going to get emotes before me.

481
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
I'm submitting everyone else's emotes before me because

482
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
I don't think it's fair.

483
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
My reeflings, you know how

484
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
unbelievably

485
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
well behaved you are for me and how patient.

486
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
And it's nicer for the girls

487
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
to have something to celebrate.

488
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
Because you already know I'm going to be here

489
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
every day.

490
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
And

491
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Oh, I was saying that my first drunk stream

492
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
I'm not sure how much people

493
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
are going to like this. And I can already see

494
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
some of you typing and rolling your

495
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
eyes. Keep your eyes to the

496
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
front of your head. I don't want one

497
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
eye rolling to the back of the skull.

498
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Um

499
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
What am I saying?

500
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Um

501
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
My first drunk

502
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
stream was going to be

503
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
uh

504
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
drunk apex but I don't go off

505
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
line until we win.

506
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
But okay.

507
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
How did you time that?

508
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
There's a stream delay. How did you even

509
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
time that?

510
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Fucking reefling in game said

511
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
eye roll. How did you time that?

512
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
30

513
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
ever stream. I well thought that

514
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
but then I was like would you guys rather

515
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
jellybean game? Some sort of drunk

516
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
multiplayer game.

517
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
So the stream is just never going to end pretty much.

518
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Apex. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Everyone's like dunking on apex.

520
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Well, there's other multiplayer games

521
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
we can play if you'd rather drunk

522
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
that. But I feel like drunk jellybean

523
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
is just going to be me like

524
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
please, please,

525
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
please let me, let me

526
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
get to the past and first level

527
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
please

528
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
I don't want to spectate.

529
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Like and I'll be drunk and all that.

530
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Why is so much fire? You had drunk

531
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
runes. How is drunk runescape fun?

532
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
I

533
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
put the shrimp on the

534
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
fire

535
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
it cooks the shrimp

536
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
and my level

537
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
gets higher

538
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
drunk fire cave

539
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Oh

540
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
got drunk. I accidentally achieved 99

541
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
fletching

542
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
runescape is never fun.

543
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
You drink every time you make an alcoholic

544
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
drink.

545
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
We won't let you get past level one

546
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
this time around.

547
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
That's what I'm worried about

548
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,920
the true endurance stream for real

549
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
for real. We'll bank the bank

550
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
runescape is a job

551
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Honestly, that's funny.

552
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Oh wait, no, that's kitchener

553
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
but you're

554
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
un-cook-trure herring.

555
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Castle wars is

556
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
for you play. Right, hydration. I need

557
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
to finish my tea.

558
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
which

559
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
yes

560
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I

561
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
I've also planned

562
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
out the membership

563
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
streams for next week. Again

564
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
if you are unable to member, please don't

565
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
worry

566
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
dear little reeflings, I stream

567
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
every single day free access

568
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
What movie did I pick?

569
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
I think I might have picked

570
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Austin Powers

571
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
for the movie

572
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
question mark. How are you keeping this

573
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,920
up?

574
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
I don't know. I thought you could only have one

575
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
or she'll start leaking secret.

576
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
No, I shut off about all the insider stuff

577
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
now. I'm starting to

578
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
leak it. Well, I've not said anything

579
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
that I regret saying. I don't

580
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
regret being like, yeah

581
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
we don't need talent managers

582
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
because it turns out if you give

583
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
actually I will like to expand

584
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
upon that point. Now that you've got me

585
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
on that subject, hold on a minute little reefling

586
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
the reason

587
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
why talent managers aren't necessarily

588
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
needed is because these girls

589
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
have streamed and they have plenty of

590
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
experience. Who goes there

591
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
and

592
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,920
to

593
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
go from

594
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
independent where you pick your streams

595
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
and you pick everything and then

596
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
you're on a one week basis where you need

597
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
approval every week to stream what you want

598
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
it just doesn't make sense or it doesn't make

599
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
sense to me. Okay, so

600
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
yeah

601
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
sad I'm going to miss the first membership stream

602
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
I mean you can always go back and watch the vods

603
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
at any point you become

604
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
a member you can access the

605
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
vods on the membership

606
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
strums. I just need to

607
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
once I make

608
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
the lobbies for them

609
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
I just need to make sure I do it for the correct

610
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
membership here

611
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
and holy crap we're creeping on the next level

612
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,920
I actually don't know what level we are

613
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
we're level 52 we're about to be

614
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
53 we're like slowly creeping up

615
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
wait are they flirting what's going on here

616
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
agility, construction

617
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
and slayer

618
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
oh we're all debating on what I thought

619
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
runecrafting was unanimously voted the worst

620
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
it's been stressful

621
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
with a manager I just

622
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
feel very strongly that

623
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
I mean

624
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
obviously in my instance

625
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
the girls in that are happy for me to say

626
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
all of them streamed way longer than me

627
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
why would they need to come

628
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,920
to me for permission to stream

629
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
it just seems rather odd

630
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
you know

631
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
just doesn't make any sense

632
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
runecrafting has a minigame now

633
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
all to make it faster

634
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
I'm thinking of

635
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
how many watch hours I need to stack up

636
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
when I get home though honestly though

637
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,920
I've

638
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
planned out

639
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
the

640
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Elden Ring streams

641
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
but

642
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
I just realised I might have to delay it by a day

643
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
because of time zones I don't know

644
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
if the DLC has a time zone release

645
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
but from being

646
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
an upside down land

647
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
whenever there's an ad for a game

648
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,920
and it's like this game comes out on this day

649
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
I'm like well that's a lie

650
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,920
it's not like time synced

651
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
because I'm in the future

652
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,920
right now I'm in the future it's 4am on the 15th

653
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
like I'm in the future you know

654
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
so I might have accidentally planned

655
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
my Elden Ring stream a day too early

656
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
before the DLC comes out

657
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
but then again

658
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
we could play it

659
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
early

660
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,920
actually no it's not going to be a problem

661
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
because we're not even going to be able to be at the DLC

662
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,920
because we're starting fresh

663
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
how's the future

664
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,920
I mean

665
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
it's alright

666
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
I ain't got much of a quarrel with it

667
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,920
that's a lot of marks of grace

668
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
yes

669
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
that's going to be a major endurance stream

670
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
back to back

671
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,920
I've planned 4 days

672
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,920
around it

673
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
it might leak into a 5th day

674
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
so sorry to anyone watching that

675
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
the Elden Ring isn't your thing

676
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
you know

677
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,920
arise you tarnish

678
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
do you have a save file already

679
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
no I was going to start fresh

680
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
I was going to start from the beginning

681
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
yeah because I like when you guys

682
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
get to hold my hand

683
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,920
so the stream

684
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
and someone sent a marshmallow

685
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
and I was like can we invade

686
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
and I'm like that's actually what we do

687
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
so 2 reeflings come in

688
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
as an invader or enemy

689
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
and it means we can safely walk around

690
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
the areas and stuff

691
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
I didn't know if I should bring out the shock collar

692
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
so every time I perish

693
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
you guys get to shock me

694
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
I don't know if that's a bit too weird though

695
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
for what we're...

696
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
I feel like it's more going to be like nostalgia run

697
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
of like all of us being like I remember this

698
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
I remember that I remember when we did this

699
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
remember when we did that

700
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
and then I've just got a shock collar going

701
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
me every time

702
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
every time I mess up

703
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
ummm

704
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
we know what I hurt you

705
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,920
I will probably be on here runescape

706
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
and during that oh I need to finish my teeth

707
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
they're cold

708
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
I've been making my

709
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,920
teeth with far too much honey

710
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
it's rubbish

711
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
alcohol poisoning no I cannot

712
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,920
I cannot drink and play runescape

713
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Elden rings there's no chance of that

714
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
the shock collar is

715
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
with sin I actually need to mess with her

716
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
because unfortunately

717
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
I need to delay that stream due to

718
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
obligations

719
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
because essentially week 3

720
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
is Elden Ring and then it would be week 4

721
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Elden Ring with sin and

722
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
I think that would

723
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,920
alienate

724
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
too many

725
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
supporters being like oh god

726
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
get off that game already

727
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,920
you can do it

728
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,920
don't let you get in the way

729
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,920
don't let yourself get in the way

730
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
honestly

731
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
I do have a fun update for those of you

732
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
who enjoy seeing my hands

733
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,920
I have successfully ordered

734
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,920
the Uwu Market

735
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
keychains

736
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
and merchandise

737
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,920
like I bought my own merchandise

738
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
type thing but I got a discount code

739
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
and all that I've got the keychains

740
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
of all the girls coming

741
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
so I'm going to do

742
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
like a little hand ASMR soon

743
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
for anyone

744
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
now don't worry this content

745
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
will be made public that I'm about to discuss

746
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
for anyone who is currently

747
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
on Patreon

748
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
they got early access to

749
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
a YouTube video

750
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,920
which was absolutely outrageous

751
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
but I'm just wanting to

752
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
know if anyone in chat

753
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,920
did listen to that outrageous

754
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
audio and what were your thoughts about it

755
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
um

756
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
I'm also using my Patreon

757
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
as a

758
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
big archive of anything that I produce

759
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
sadly

760
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
4 audios are unable to be

761
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,920
uploaded to it because I was

762
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
very dumb

763
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
I've made a 4 part

764
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
series

765
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
that has hypnosis

766
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
in it but Patreon actually doesn't allow

767
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
that

768
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
so I'm going to upload it on my

769
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Twitter for free not a problem

770
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,920
I just need to edit it and get out of the way

771
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,920
but it means

772
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
I'm now missing 4 audios

773
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
um

774
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
raw tuna

775
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
that's cooked that's cooked that's cooked

776
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
that's cooked so

777
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Lobster's tuna and then we tackle

778
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
the 10k freaking

779
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
swordfish

780
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
this is going to be interesting

781
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,920
I keep running out of love

782
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
um

783
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,920
the hoodies

784
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
no nothing is limited by Ubu Market

785
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,920
um

786
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,920
actually I need to talk to them again

787
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
because

788
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Azura is coming up

789
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
um

790
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
y'all

791
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
why does he not like hypnosis

792
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Mastercard

793
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
our unloved overlords

794
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
have deemed that

795
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
hypnosis isn't

796
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
consensual for some reason

797
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
even though it fully is like you will never

798
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
do something that you don't want to do

799
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
um

800
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
and unfortunately

801
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,920
Patreon always have to bend the knee

802
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
a lot of people have issues with Patreon

803
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
but the reality of the situation is

804
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
our overlords that we despise

805
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
the ones who are on Epstein Island

806
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,920
all the time

807
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
but deem hypnosis as non consensual

808
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,920
so it cannot be

809
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
uploaded to Patreon however

810
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
um

811
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
I'm going to say something and this is a bit controversial

812
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
but guess what

813
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,920
Elon Musk announced that Twitter is absolutely

814
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
fine with that kind of content

815
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
so I'm sorry but one up on Elon

816
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Musk because he couldn't give less of a rat's

817
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
arse and to be honest

818
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
that's kind of what I'm looking for when it comes to

819
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
just making content

820
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
we're all adults here we're all doing our thing

821
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,920
like there's no need for

822
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
all these things going on

823
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
uh

824
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
but yeah

825
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,920
uh

826
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
yes um so unfortunately

827
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,920
it means I have four missing loot

828
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
oh I shouldn't say those words

829
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
sorry four inkable

830
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
audios so I need to go

831
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
like record so

832
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
I'm not actually sure what my

833
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
fourth upload this month is going to be on Patreon

834
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
because

835
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
um

836
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,920
originally it was supposed to be

837
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
a part one of this series

838
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
but it's not possible

839
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
um

840
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
yes

841
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
yes

842
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,920
um but yeah did you like the audio

843
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,920
for those of you who are on Patreon

844
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
because it was absolutely outrageous

845
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
you can probably monetize twitter eventually

846
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
oh you need

847
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
five million impressions I'm not sure we're there

848
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920
unless like well she

849
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
stares

850
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
and Mercy

851
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,920
managed to get caught in the algorithm

852
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
when

853
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
this new meta came up

854
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
so they actually probably do

855
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,920
have that

856
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
um

857
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
but uh

858
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
yeah like if twitter is like

859
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,920
oh I burnt all of them

860
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
I have five

861
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
lobbies out of that that's terrible

862
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
ooh

863
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
that was a really rough run right lobbies

864
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
we've got 500

865
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
let's see how much we just absolutely

866
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
waste honestly

867
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
I'll do the camera and go like that

868
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
eh

869
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
it was very unhinged that ASMR

870
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
yeah

871
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
I thought it was hilarious I was like

872
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,920
freaking jumping around the mic

873
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,920
I was doing like backflips trying to like

874
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
come over and like get it louder and stuff

875
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
do you know how many I put so many

876
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
like noise dampening filters

877
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
on the audio as well

878
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
but the clap was so loud

879
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
it was outrageous

880
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
um

881
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
I don't know if it'll survive on youtube

882
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
but I'll still upload it as a yolo anyway

883
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
cause it's hilarious and I don't care

884
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,920
and to be honest

885
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,920
I never really did anything that outrageous

886
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
cause it's just sound like to me it's like

887
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
just the sound of someone clapping their hands

888
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
okay it's just what's actually

889
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
happening that's a bit outrageous

890
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,920
but because there's no audio it's fain

891
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
eh so because

892
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
there's no visual unhinged

893
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
isn't a negative thing

894
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
the audio is the reason

895
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
eh

896
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
I'll have to go stuff to see the

897
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
7th grade

898
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,920
yeah basically I did clapping ASMR

899
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
but I didn't use my

900
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
hands

901
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
I wonder

902
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
well I'm gonna see if I can get some fish

903
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
I don't need any more fish if it's for me

904
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
I'm sure you've got 10k swordfish

905
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,920
um but yeah

906
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,920
that's the audio I made

907
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
oh my god we've almost leveled up again

908
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
54

909
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,920
that's fantastic

910
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
what a genius entrepreneur truly

911
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
I fell asleep to the begging one

912
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
really?

913
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
that was so popular

914
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,920
I definitely hit the algorithm

915
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,920
because

916
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
well someone said on one of my

917
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
ASMR stream

918
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,920
wait what happened there

919
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
someone said on my ASMR stream

920
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
that

921
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,920
I was on tiktok

922
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
feature page

923
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
but um

924
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
vealer doesn't upload to tiktok

925
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,920
we've reserved everyone's name on tiktok

926
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
just in case

927
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
but it's more important to do youtube

928
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
shorts vs tiktok

929
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
like over that kind of thing

930
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,920
um

931
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,920
what liquid you put on your

932
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
not hands I heard you spray something

933
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
at the beginning

934
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
oh it's coconut oil

935
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
it's oil

936
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
in the audio

937
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
you can hear me take off my prel

938
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,920
I left that in on purpose

939
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
because I breathed

940
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,920
heavily through it and I was like

941
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
I'll edit this out but then I was like

942
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
oh maybe someone would enjoy it

943
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
so I just left it in

944
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
so you can literally hear me take off my weapon drew

945
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,920
an armor

946
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
nudge nudge

947
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
tiktok clippers

948
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
no like um so on tiktok

949
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,920
it's called

950
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
a video format it's called tiktok

951
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,920
whereas youtube it's called a short

952
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
and twitch it's a clip

953
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
but it's all the same thing

954
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
oh I leveled up I got

955
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
54 oh my gosh

956
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,920
maybe 78 is gonna be

957
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
like way before like at the rate

958
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
we're doing these lobbies

959
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
um coconut

960
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
my beloved

961
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
ah thank you

962
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
um oh my god that voice crack

963
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
70 is fast yeah I feel like maybe

964
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
I might have

965
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
underestimated how much we're gonna get

966
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
the little extra sounds add a lot

967
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,920
oh right so I can actually tell you

968
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
the behind the scenes of recording the coconut clapping

969
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,920
let's call it the coconut clapping

970
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
that'll be our code word for it

971
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,920
um so

972
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
the reason why you hear me go

973
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,920
oh and then

974
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
I do it is because I had to hold on

975
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
to my

976
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
my gooblies because they were

977
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
bumping

978
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
and jumping because of like

979
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
in order to make

980
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
um your buns of steel

981
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
clap you have to like go up and down

982
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
quite not violently

983
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
but you have to make it quite fast that's something

984
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
sometimes I do it slowly and then sometimes

985
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
it's like one after

986
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,920
what I'd clap that coconut

987
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
I mean what the cool thing

988
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
is that you can fully unleash the Scottish accent

989
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
does that mean it tastes like coconut

990
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
I mean right now probably

991
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
oh I should do that smell trend

992
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,920
I keep forgetting coconut clapping

993
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
like want to bite them

994
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
if you cook at a range next to where you're burning

995
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
ah I can't be bothered moving though

996
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
I want to stay with my reeflings at the fire

997
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
I was gone for five just strong

998
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
he died no I'm level

999
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
54 we've

1000
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
just came to realize I've probably

1001
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
severely underestimated that we're

1002
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
achieved 70 this stream

1003
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
we are most likely going to have

1004
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
a lot more than that

1005
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
um

1006
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,920
aggressively clapping coconut

1007
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
well at one minute I was like I feel like

1008
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,920
um saw

1009
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
I think I said saw but what I meant was

1010
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
jaws that shark like that din din

1011
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
cause I was away I went

1012
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
walked further away from the microphone

1013
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
and then came closer and it was like

1014
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
din din din din clap clap

1015
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
din din din clap clap clap clap

1016
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
this is one of the most ridiculous

1017
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
audios I've ever made but

1018
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
I got halfway

1019
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
through editing my

1020
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
first

1021
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
1k thank you

1022
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
oh wait I've got salmon sugar

1023
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
I didn't notice that salmon there

1024
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
wait I'll finish off the salmon

1025
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
um

1026
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
I got halfway through

1027
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
finishing my first like 1000

1028
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
special ASMR

1029
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
and it's just me rambling

1030
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,920
in dune tingles it honestly

1031
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
probably feels like a live stream like

1032
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,920
when I just start rambling whilst I'm doing tingles

1033
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,920
but like I was having so much fun

1034
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
like

1035
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
being like guess what this is

1036
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
oh my god this is actually a sponge I don't know

1037
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
if you could guess that type thing like I was

1038
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
just getting so excited so it doesn't

1039
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
sound like ASMR again

1040
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
from the aster

1041
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
tuber

1042
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
I like 92 is halfway to

1043
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,920
99 XP wise

1044
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
hey oh dear lord

1046
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
um

1047
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
hi hello thank you for joining

1048
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
don't worry 70 isn't even halfway at 99

1049
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
hmm

1050
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,920

runescape and I picked

John Wick series

1058
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
um

1059
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
as if I burnt a singular

1060
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
salmon

1061
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,920

1076
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,920
the way she was going to call her

1077
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
fan page bebble pales was

1078
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
hilarious I can't remember it wasn't bebble pales was it

1079
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920

1080
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
it was absolutely hilarious

1081
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
um I remember

1082
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
being like

1083
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,920
she said what out loud when she said

1084
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
that I was absolutely he ho in

1085
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
um

1086
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
but then she couldn't keep the fan name

1087
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
and I'm like it is probably for the better

1088
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
people but you're absolutely hilarious

1089
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920

but yeah literally

1099
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
it was hilarious

1100
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920

1101
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920

literally the girl

1106
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
as far as I'm aware the girls are happy

1107
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
they can pick what they want do what they want

1108
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
um unfortunately

1109
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
because

1110
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
Azura and

1111
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,920
Emmy are on a warning

unfortunately I've not

1122
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
well I've kind of discouraged them

1123
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
for doing ASMR until the warning is up

1124
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
because it's very dangerous

1125
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
if they get a strike

1126
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
I'm like brav

1127
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
YouTube please

1128
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
I'm back

1129
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
I got distracted oh don't worry

1130
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
I'm literally here for 12 hours

1131
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
don't worry we're doing an endurance today

1132
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
I have had so many short streams

1133
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
this week it felt so weird

1134
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
like

1135
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
I do have a lot of time to like finally start editing

1136
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
I have a heck of a lot

1137
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
of VTuber ASMR collabs

1138
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
coming through I wrote an ASMR

1139
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
collab for two of the girls

1140
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,920
and they all were together

1141
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
um

1142
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
and

1143
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
the girls

1144
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
one of them reacted and thought the plot

1145
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
was adorable

1146
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
it's just super basic short plot

1147
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
I never want to overwhelm the girls

1148
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
with anything that I assign them

1149
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,920
so please don't think it's like some super mega

1150
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
do do do do do

1151
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,920
I know

1152
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
that there is a collab with Mercy

1153
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
that's both audio and

1154
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
we get to play Goose Game tomorrow

1155
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
not tomorrow

1156
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,920
not tomorrow next week

1157
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
next week

1158
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
I am going to play RuneScape

1159
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
before it because

1160
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
I am going to stream on

1161
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Mercy's time zone

1162
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
like when she normally streams

1163
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
so basically we're going to play

1164
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
RuneScape for a solid

1165
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,920
chunk and then I'm going to go offline

1166
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,920
and rest my voice for like an hour

1167
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,920
or two

1168
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,920
hours because I'll be in voice call

1169
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
with Mercy one hour before

1170
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
the collab if you didn't know

1171
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
it is common courtesy for VTubers

1172
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
to show up one hour before

1173
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
a collab which is where you

1174
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
do all of your

1175
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
um technical

1176
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
failures as I had with

1177
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
flipping

1178
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
again special shout out to

1179
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Shibi for keeping my head on my shoulders

1180
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
I was panicking when

1181
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
we could not do it up

1182
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
and

1183
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
she's grinding so fast

1184
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
baby won't you

1185
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
grind on me

1186
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
relax your mind

1187
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
church your time

1188
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
will move

1189
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
that's all I know of that song

1190
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,920
I got one cake carambua

1191
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,920
of the pussy

1192
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
wow

1193
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
when you start cooking members food

1194
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
I have like

1195
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
10,000 swordfish to go through

1196
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
I have no idea what even potential

1197
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
XP that might is

1198
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
that might is okay

1199
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
well one you're done what English was that

1200
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
um is that a threat or a promise

1201
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,920
um oh I was gonna

1202
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
do marshmallows

1203
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
actually I've got such nice

1204
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
marshmallows you guys need to stop being so nice to me

1205
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
because if I get emotional

1206
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,920
and start reading them I start getting

1207
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920
teary-eyed and I'm like I can't handle these

1208
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
right now because it's gonna like make me cry

1209
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
like happy tears

1210
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,920
um so you guys need to stop being so nice to me

1211
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
there's currently a riflin

1212
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
um

1213
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
who's keeping me updated about their addiction

1214
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
right now and they're like

1215
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
I don't even feel the need to go back to my addiction

1216
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,920
I'm like oh my god you're kicking your addiction

1217
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
I'm like how

1218
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,920
how are you what how

1219
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
like that's amazing like I could get into

1220
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
the nitty-gritty of like how insane addiction

1221
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
is and look

1222
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
your brain once it creates

1223
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
a neural pathway it likes it wants to keep repeating

1224
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,920
that it's nice and easy it's why nostalgia

1225
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,920
is so powerful because you don't have to like

1226
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,920
learn the new lore of something

1227
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,920
it sounds silly but

1228
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
um

1229
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,920
like it's very easy

1230
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,920
to fall into addiction

1231
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
and especially

1232
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,920
your makeup your genetic

1233
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
makeup can make you predispositioned

1234
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
for it as well it's quite it's quite fascinating

1235
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
because it's like it's kind of like

1236
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
gamba like I spoke previously

1237
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,920
I had a

1238
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
advertisement offer

1239
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
of four thousand US dollars

1240
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
to insert a 60 second

1241
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,920
gamba ad

1242
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
and I said no because

1243
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,920
it's gamba

1244
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
but it's very interesting

1245
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
how

1246
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,920
severely gamba seems to

1247
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
affect individuals

1248
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,920
now this is just an observation

1249
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
but whenever I've seen

1250
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,920
gamba ads that are like stop when the fund

1251
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,920
stops a ten thousand

1252
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
swordfish should get you to level 78

1253
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,920
let's go oh my god

1254
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,920
78 by the end of the stream

1255
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
um

1256
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,920
whenever you see a gamba ad that's like don't

1257
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
is like stop stop when the fund stops

1258
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
they always show a guy

1259
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,920
and I'm wondering

1260
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
um

1261
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
not the pre

1262
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,920
the socialization

1263
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,920
because obviously if we're being

1264
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,920
very stereotypical of society

1265
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
we live in a society

1266
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
guys are normally more interested in

1267
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
sports and

1268
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,920
is the environment around it that it's

1269
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
normal to gamble

1270
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
and kind of like put a cheeky

1271
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,920
a tenner here on this

1272
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,920
bet a 20

1273
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,920
quid here on this bet type thing

1274
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
before it snowballs out of control

1275
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
it's quite

1276
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,920
fascinating I actually had someone

1277
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,920
in real life I knew

1278
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,920
that

1279
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,920
they weren't a family member

1280
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,920
but they were like an acquaintance and I learned

1281
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
of their story

1282
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,920
and basically

1283
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,920
the guy gambled away their mortgage

1284
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
and

1285
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,920
it's just

1286
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,920
it's such a shame what kind of

1287
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,920
grip it has

1288
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,920
on certain people because

1289
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,920
for me right now

1290
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
I

1291
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,920
I'm like confident that I don't

1292
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
have that kind of addiction

1293
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
I

1294
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
I don't it doesn't appeal to me

1295
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
I would I would walk away

1296
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
like angry that I wasted

1297
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
my money type thing like my brain

1298
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
doesn't go oh

1299
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
if I gamble again I'll make back

1300
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
what I lost like no my brain's like

1301
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
what a waste of time that was I'd rather play

1302
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,920
like a video game or something else like that

1303
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
you know

1304
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,920
I wish I could join you but not on

1305
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
RuneScape wait what's wrong with RuneScape

1306
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,920
it's old school

1307
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,920
look these are all reeflings we're all just hanging

1308
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
out outside the we're all hanging

1309
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,920
out in Edgeville for no particular

1310
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
reason

1311
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,920
um

1312
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
yeah sorry I don't know if

1313
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,920
I need to turn down the

1314
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,920
that sound effect yeah

1315
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,920
I'll turn down the sound effect just because

1316
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,920
it's very repetitive

1317
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,920
and hopefully you can still

1318
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
kind of hear a bit

1319
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,920
sorry

1320
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,920
we're in Edgeville together you can do better

1321
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,920
90% of gamblers quit

1322
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
before they've been big now I have seen

1323
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,920
those memes I have to admit they're a wee bit funny

1324
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,920
but it is

1325
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,920
just a very curious

1326
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
predicament that people seem to get

1327
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,920
themselves into I mean that's kind of what

1328
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
kick the website kick.com

1329
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,920
if you heard about it

1330
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
the only

1331
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,920
reason they are able to be

1332
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,920
fueled so high is because

1333
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,920
of Gambo

1334
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
there's no other

1335
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,920
reason and it's perfectly

1336
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,920
fine to say that

1337
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,920
but it just kind of goes to show

1338
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,920
you how big the house always

1339
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
wins if they can offer this

1340
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
business model on the side like I

1341
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
remember I don't know if you guys remember

1342
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,920
when Twitch like officially announced

1343
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
it's like banning Gambo

1344
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
it's just very curious

1345
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
because

1346
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
there's a lot of

1347
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,920
discussion you can get into and you can say

1348
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,920
well the person that's Gambo

1349
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
and it's their money

1350
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
it's their life

1351
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
it's their choice

1352
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,920
but if like

1353
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,920
the oh I'm trying to

1354
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
think and do two things at once and it's not coming out in a

1355
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,920
sense so

1356
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,920
is it the

1357
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,920
right hold on hold on let me put my sense together

1358
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,920
when is it not a choice

1359
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
when is it not a choice is the

1360
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,920
question why is it it's

1361
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,920
addiction and not a choice when it comes

1362
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,920
to Gambo but it

1363
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,920
might be a choice when it comes to other bad

1364
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,920
actions you might do in your life

1365
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,920
why is Gambo marked out for one

1366
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,920
why is alcoholism marked out for one

1367
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,920
obviously when it comes to alcoholism

1368
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,920
your body does change the tolerance

1369
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,920
but you could argue the same for Gambo

1370
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,920
because your brain literally

1371
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,920
lights up like fireworks

1372
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,920
when you win

1373
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,920
and

1374
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
it's just very interesting because where's

1375
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
the line drawn from someone is consenting

1376
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,920
to do this activity and someone

1377
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,920
isn't able to consent to do this activity

1378
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
because it's causing harm because

1379
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,920
you could argue sitting on runescape

1380
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,920
for 12 hours well that's causing harm

1381
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,920
oh well

1382
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,920
we'll need to take her offline

1383
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,920
because she's not well because she's doing this

1384
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,920
for 12 hours because that's bad

1385
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,920
for her health sitting for 12 hours

1386
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,920
type thing you know

1387
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,920
like do you know what I'm trying to like say out loud

1388
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,920
I struggle to say the words

1389
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
RATMA thank you for coming

1390
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
I'll member to your destructive behaviors

1391
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,920
that have historically

1392
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,920
been deemed as vices that's where it is

1393
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,920
yeah like we're being

1394
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
called out literally all runescapers

1395
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,920
getting called out from across the line

1396
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
wow we're about to level up again

1397
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
oh my god just hit just let me

1398
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
do one ramble and we're gonna be

1399
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,920
99 overnight like just

1400
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
give me one subject to ramble

1401
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
about and we're done there is a log out

1402
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
timer after six hours and I will

1403
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,920
most likely log me out when I go for the big job

1404
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,920
I don't need one right now

1405
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,920
um

1406
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,920
but yeah

1407
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,920
me and college maxing on runescape

1408
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
citizen homework real

1409
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,920
the lanes do get but well that's

1410
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,920
it's the interesting thing it's like when

1411
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,920
where do laws come into place to

1412
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
protect gamba

1413
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,920
gamblers sorry

1414
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
um because when you lose

1415
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,920
your money you're told tough

1416
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,920
tough bananas

1417
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,920
yeah 56

1418
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
yatta

1419
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,920
when you lose all your money you're told

1420
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,920
tough bananas

1421
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
when you lose your money to a scam

1422
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,920
the bank says see tough bananas

1423
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,920
yeah there's laws in place to

1424
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,920
protect you in quotation marks and to

1425
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,920
get um the scammers

1426
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,920
put in jail to get well you can't

1427
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,920
really put um

1428
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,920
casinos in jail so that doesn't work

1429
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
uh that's a terrible

1430
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
uh comparison

1431
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,920
um

1432
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,920
hmm

1433
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,920
hmm well

1434
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,920
I've kind of shot myself in that line of

1435
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,920
line of thought I've uh completely undone

1436
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,920
my that line of thought there I do apologize

1437
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,920
um

1438
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,920
yes yes yes yes

1439
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,920
there's really no good answer no there

1440
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,920
isn't that's the thing

1441
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,920
that's the thing that's the thing I want

1442
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
to highlight there is

1443
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,920
no answer and

1444
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,920
yet we still have some laws

1445
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,920
such as you know obviously twitch

1446
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,920
isn't law but twitch is a reflection

1447
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,920
of the community views

1448
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,920
or the community the views of the masses

1449
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,920
now do you remember

1450
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,920
when uh

1451
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,920
wikimane was like yeah gamba bad

1452
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
and then all of a sudden twitter

1453
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,920
blew up and then twitter was like

1454
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,920
gamba bad and then twitch

1455
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,920
was like okay now we'll remove

1456
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,920
gamba like

1457
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
that is a perfect

1458
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,920
example of

1459
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
the most basic movement now don't

1460
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,920
get me wrong movement isn't world changing

1461
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,920
but it is the basic example

1462
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,920
of someone who definitely

1463
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
has a larger platform even denying it

1464
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,920
going hey this thing

1465
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,920
bad and then everyone going

1466
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,920
wait a minute yes

1467
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,920
this thing is bad

1468
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,920
and then boom

1469
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
twitch

1470
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,920
got rid of the category

1471
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
and outlawed it and said no bad

1472
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
now that is

1473
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
and just

1474
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
a bloody perfect example

1475
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,920
of how

1476
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,920
the community

1477
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,920
the community in

1478
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,920
specific areas and pockets

1479
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,920
do have a voice

1480
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,920
and do have a say

1481
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,920
as much as you might not think on an individual

1482
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,920
level you don't have a voice

1483
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,920
it might be true but have you ever

1484
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,920
seen planet of the apes

1485
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,920
monkey on own

1486
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,920
weak

1487
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,920
monkey together strong

1488
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,920
it is true

1489
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,920
you can't even deny it there's so many

1490
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,920
examples of this

1491
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,920
like think of revolutions

1492
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,920
such as the french revolution

1493
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
one individual would get their head

1494
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,920
guillotined okay

1495
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,920
I'm not being funny I'm being so

1496
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,920
true this is my rabbit hole

1497
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,920
but like literally the french

1498
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
revolution one person stands up

1499
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,920
and gets their head chopped off right

1500
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
no revolution no movement

1501
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,920
community is not you know

1502
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,920
community is not going to rise up

1503
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,920
but hold on a minute the people are revolting

1504
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,920
the people are

1505
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,920
revolting the masses are outraged

1506
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,920
how can society continue

1507
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,920
if everyone bands together

1508
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,920
and

1509
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,920
historically every 400 years

1510
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,920
society

1511
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,920
shifts and what do I mean by

1512
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,920
society shifts something new

1513
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,920
comes up for society to be

1514
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
a part of okay

1515
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,920
so before capitalism

1516
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,920
which is when global

1517
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,920
economics became a thing

1518
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,920
the industrial revolution

1519
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,920
global economics there was

1520
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,920
region locked capitalism

1521
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
okay and it's called feudalism

1522
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,920
or something like that it's like

1523
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,920
it's not feudalism it's like feudalism

1524
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,920
okay

1525
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,920
which was when

1526
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,920
lords owned

1527
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,920
the plots of land and permitted

1528
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,920
peasants to generate food

1529
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,920
on those lands okay

1530
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,920
that was region locked capitalism

1531
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,920
before we know capitalism today

1532
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,920
okay but that got outdated

1533
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,920
when the revolution came in

1534
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,920
because you know

1535
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,920
people learn fast to

1536
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,920
grow certain crops

1537
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,920
and if you breed crops I can't remember

1538
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,920
who did the crop breeding

1539
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,920
what's his name

1540
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,920
I've forgotten

1541
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,920
feudalism is with lords yes

1542
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,920
yes the chickens are revolting

1543
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,920
finally we agree on something

1544
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,920
bro it's not 400 years it's like a decade

1545
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,920
stuff changes all the time

1546
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,920
but like another massive example

1547
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,920
of a shift in society

1548
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,920
some of yous are not going to like this

1549
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,920
you're in for a rambling stream

1550
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,920
you've got me for 12 hours

1551
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,920
as if I'm not going to get on my high horse and teach you history

1552
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,920
okay

1553
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
if you did not know

1554
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,920
in Christianity

1555
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,920
there's the Old Testament

1556
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,920
and there's the New Testament

1557
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,920
the New Testament

1558
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,920
was created

1559
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,920
I believe

1560
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,920
in roughly the 15th century

1561
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,920
the church got together

1562
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,920
and went look the Old Testament

1563
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,920
isn't doing it for the masses

1564
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,920
people are starting to question that

1565
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,920
because people are becoming aware

1566
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,920
that you know

1567
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
some things aren't working out

1568
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,920
in this story

1569
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,920
and basically

1570
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,920
the New Testament is just

1571
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,920
friggin made up

1572
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,920
1500

1573
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,920
years later after

1574
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,920
Jebus the source

1575
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,920
supposedly passed away

1576
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,920
you're so right strongy let's eat the rich

1577
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,920
fondly thank you for this too

1578
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,920
like some people can't conceptualise

1579
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,920
the difference between a million and a billion

1580
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,920
dollars

1581
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,920
now take that million

1582
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,920
and add one and then add one and then add one

1583
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,920
then add one and keep going and keep going and keep going

1584
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,920
and keep going and keep going

1585
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,920
but anyway

1586
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,920
casually red fill in the masses

1587
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,920
bruv I'm not kidding I will keep mentioning

1588
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,920
the game

1589
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,920
needy streamer overload

1590
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,920
I don't believe they put that in the game

1591
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,920
that kind of thing

1592
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,920
but anyway

1593
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,920
anyway that's just me

1594
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,920
I don't know what you guys are thinking

1595
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,920
but that's just me

1596
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,920
but I could really get on my high horse

1597
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,920
I should actually I want to do an education stream

1598
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,920
about feudalism

1599
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,920
because

1600
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,920
and kind of how history and how society used to work

1601
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,920
because bargaining used to be how

1602
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,920
it was done

1603
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,920
bargaining used to be like hey

1604
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,920
two weeks

1605
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,920
would you trade me one potato for two

1606
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,920
weeks that's how it used to be done

1607
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,920
that's how there was value in things

1608
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,920
that's how humans

1609
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,920
did it and

1610
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,920
there are

1611
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,920
there are some examples today

1612
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
of it kind of thriving

1613
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,920
and

1614
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,920
so runescape is historically

1615
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,920
accurate yes

1616
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,920
you guys trading me right now

1617
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,920
you are calling upon your ancestors

1618
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,920
to give me the resources that you don't need

1619
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,920
in the moment

1620
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,920
you are looking after me and in return

1621
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,920
I will scratch your back later

1622
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,920
it's literally why I'm such a big believer

1623
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,920
and you scratch my back I scratch yours

1624
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,920
because that's how it used to be

1625
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,920
return to monkey

1626
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,920
replays return to monkey

1627
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,920
we were so nice

1628
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,920
we had some communities

1629
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,920
we had said it's a belonging

1630
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,920
it's so

1631
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,920
nice

1632
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,920
the old test schools

1633
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,920
I'm curious

1634
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,920
I've not touched old schools runescape

1635
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,920
what's with the cooking not cooking window

1636
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,920
on the top left so I am using

1637
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,920
a plugin called runelight

1638
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,920
you can see it up here this plugin

1639
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,920
can track your things

1640
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,920
there are good bad examples of this

1641
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,920
one stick is weak

1642
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,920
many together are strong

1643
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,920
like the 1940

1644
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,920
not good monkey

1645
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,920
thank you Iron Ripper for the tip

1646
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,920

00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,920
more likely than you think

1673
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,920
voila

1674
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,920

Scotland being Germany

00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,920
I probably not I think

1683
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,920

1872
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,920
when I was sleeping so she'll

1873
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,920
don't worry don't worry about my pooders

1874
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,920
and whenever I go make a tea in that

1875
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,920
I go give her some attention

1876
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,920
baby boy is really independent

1877
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,920
though he's like not he couldn't care

1878
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,920
I don't know if it's cause he's half

1879
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,920
munchkin that he's

1880
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,920
more tired than the usual cat

1881
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,920
like you can get depending on the breed of

1882
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,920
your cat it can be really tired

1883
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,920
in general and need like more sleep

1884
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,920
like I'm pretty sure there's

1885
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,920
a type of dog that's known for sleeping

1886
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,920
oh wait it's greyhounds

1887
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,920
greyhounds are like the laziest

1888
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,920
dog ever but they can do like

1889
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,920
one burst sprint type thing

1890
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,920
um

1891
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,920
yeah 21 million

1892
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,920
um literally I got sugar daddy

1893
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,920
out the wazoo cause of reeflings

1894
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,920
they were throwing them

1895
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,920
coins to me I was like I'm not gonna

1896
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,920
say no this is gonna fund the

1897
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,920
I don't know if we're doing wine

1898
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,920
I don't know wine is the

1899
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,920
fastest level up

1900
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,920
once I've like cooked everything

1901
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,920
if I push it I can

1902
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,920
finish my first save file in November

1903
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,920
oh I haven't even finished a save file

1904
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,920
I was considering doing some eating runs

1905
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,920
just to show you guys

1906
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,920
what

1907
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,920
the binding of Isaac is all about

1908
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,920
um

1909
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,920
who needs a bot farm when you have a cult

1910
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,920
giving you everything you need

1911
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,920
literally though

1912
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,920
when I had a st. Bernard

1913
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,920
it felt like it slept for 20 hours a day

1914
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,920
yeah like depending on the breed

1915
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,920
um but she's just

1916
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,920
moody I fed her and I played

1917
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,920
with her mouse

1918
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,920
but the problem is because

1919
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,920
I let her in yesterday

1920
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,920
she now thinks she can come in whenever she wants

1921
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,920
um

1922
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,920
you're a bit of a diva

1923
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,920
Gimli you're a bit of a diva

1924
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,920
I have to admit

1925
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,920
but I love her

1926
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,920
I love her

1927
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,920
you're always cooking

1928
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,920
oh I ain't just cooking in Rinske

1929
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,920
um

1930
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,920
I can't

1931
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,920
tomorrow's crash bandicoot

1932
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,920
um

1933
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,920
yes

1934
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,920
I think

1935
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,920
July streams

1936
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,920
I'm gonna focus on Xbox games

1937
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,920
to get my gamer score up

1938
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,920
um

1939
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,920
I've done decent progress

1940
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,920
on my goal of collabing with 100 vtubers

1941
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,920
with

1942
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,920
a 3d old thing

1943
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,920
like 3 ASMR collabs

1944
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,920
I have absolutely no issue with actually collabing on stream

1945
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,920
yeah good luck with that

1946
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,920
I'm too shy

1947
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,920
I've made great progress

1948
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,920
I think I'm just shy of

1949
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,920
6 ASMR collabs

1950
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,920
um

1951
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,920
and then I need to

1952
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,920
reach out

1953
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,920
and do

1954
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,920
hmm

1955
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,920
I want to make all of my goals

1956
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,920
happen before the one year mark

1957
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,920
which means I have to work hard now

1958
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,920
um

1959
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,920
so

1960
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,920

and we've got membership coming up as well

1962
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,920

1963
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,920
to make up for but I hope

1964
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,920

1965
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,920
and all my hard work there like

1966
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,920
I'm making up for lost time

1967
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,920
you know it's going good

1968
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,920

1969
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,920

01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,920
I want it to be like good funny times

1971
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,920
like literally uploaded that meme ASMR

1972
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,920
like please let me hold it

1973
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,920
any plans for halo yes

1974
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,920
I would love if I could actually

1975
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,920
do

1976
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,920
a vtuber collab on halo

1977
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,920
but

1978
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,920
I don't know anyone who's played halo

1979
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,920
I will ask the violour girls

1980
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,920
first before I ask around

1981
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,920
and see if anyone's played halo

1982
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,920
um

1983
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,920
not that you need to be

1984
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,920
um good at halo

1985
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,920
to play it like you need to know about it

1986
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,920
but I'd rather

1987
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,920
I think if you're playing a nostalgic

1988
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,920
game I'd rather like two people who are

1989
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,920
familiar with it play and that sounds

1990
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,920
really rude I hope it doesn't come across as rude

1991
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,920
but I mean

1992
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,920
I'm sure there's another halo vtuber that's

1993
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,920
freaking played random question

1994
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,920

01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,920
with you guys and it's not an issue

2023

01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,920
and I won't have it

2031
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,920

we literally can't outrun them

2035
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,920
that gartic phone stream was so

2036
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,920
fun though the girls are so funny

2037
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,920
um

2038
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,920

01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,920
the

2040
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,920
already levelled up again

2041
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,920
literally I am rambling through these levels

2042
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,920
like nothing on earth

2043
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,920
like I wake up on the other side of the ramble

2044
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,920
and we're literally 58

2045
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,920
that's fantastic

2046
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,920
oh my goodness

2047
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,920
all these lobbies

2048
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,920
I'm burning them a wee bit but it's fine

2049
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,920
okay you and emmy agree hard

2050
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,920
on that ending yeah

2051
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,920
literally I'm sorry but why on earth would you make

2052
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,920
why would you

2053
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,920
why would you play the game and be like

2054
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,920
uh I'm not gonna do that ending

2055
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,920
no the whole point is to like

2056
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,920
be fine with human curiosity

2057
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,920
like as long as you don't produce any offspring

2058
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,920
no one gives a rest

2059
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,920
no one gives a

2060
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,920
honestly

2061
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,920
um

2062
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,920
hmm

2063
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,920
halo would be a fun way to do community games

2064
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,920
uh like the halo molly

2065
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,920
player I never actually played much of it

2066
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,920
I heard

2067
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,920
the bat

2068
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,920
was it a halo battle pass came out

2069
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,920
and it was just an absolute shambles

2070
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,920
like it was just a terrible

2071
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,920
multiplayer launch

2072
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,920
and it and then they did battle

2073
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,920
pass and then it just became

2074
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,920
like this terrible

2075
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,920
thing I don't know

2076
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,920
what ending the one

2077
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,920
true ending

2078
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,920
oh actually

2079
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,920
I was lurking quite a lot someone was like

2080

wait I don't get it are we emmy's brother

2081
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,920
the reason why you can

2082
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,920
see emmy at all times when she streams

2083
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,920
is because you're her dead brother

2084
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,920
watching over her

2085
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,920
I will spell it out for you

2086
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,920

2087
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,920
dead brother watching over her

2088
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,920
which is why you can see her stream

2089
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,920
which is why you can see her thoughts

2090
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,920
on twitter okay

2091
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,920

01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,920

the girls via ubu market

01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,920
the income generated

2145
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,920
veiler do not take a cut

2146
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,920
and the girls can attest to that

2147
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,920
em we don't have

2148
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,920
anything to do with it

2149
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,920
and it completely and wholeheartedly supports them

2150
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,920

2151
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,920
collect all the key chains of the girls

2152
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,920

2165
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,920
they really have

2166
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,920
is the merch limited

2167
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,920
no it's not

2168
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,920
it's gonna stay up

2169
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,920
until we expire

2170
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,920
ubu market has been

2171
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,920
absolutely fantastic to work with

2172
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,920
em they are

2173
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,920
super good I am aware

2174
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,920
that they got a bit of flat

2175
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,920
cause of some production issues

2176
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,920
but they actually moved

2177
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,920
em they moved

2178
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,920
locations quite a few times

2179
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,920
cause their business expanded so fast

2180
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,920
that they basically had growing pains

2181
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,920
but I have never personally

2182
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,920
had an issue with them now I know that's

2183
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,920
kinda being like well you never had an issue

2184
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,920
with others that's just dismissing the others

2185
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,920
relax I understand how it works

2186
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,920
but em to work with

2187
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,920
ubu market they've been

2188
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,920
they were so understanding from the get go

2189
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,920
cause I messaged them and I'm like

2190
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,920
hey violers the thing

2191
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,920
I'd love it if the girls can keep 100%

2192
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,920
of the earnings

2193
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,920
we as the company don't want to take a cut

2194
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,920
and they're like yeah we can set that up

2195
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,920
no problem and I was like here

2196
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,920
here's all the references to the artwork

2197
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,920
yeah we can do that no problem

2198
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,920
and just they've handled everything

2199
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,920
and it has been really nice

2200
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,920
to not have to deal with anything

2201
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,920
it makes things nice

2202
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,920
and juicy and easy

2203
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,920
em

2204
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,920
one of the things, few things about

2205
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,920
violers the lack of corporation greed

2206
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,920
yeah I just

2207
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,920
I I mean

2208
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,920
Shawnee can your patterns

2209
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,920
go in reverse

2210
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,920
no they can't they can not

2211
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,920
they only go in reverse if I do that

2212
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,920
it'll like should yeah see

2213
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,920
how it goes in reverse it's because

2214
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,920
it has to reset to the top

2215
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,920
of my head in order to do that

2216
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,920
reverse thing oh we can

2217
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,920
test that again yeah see how it

2218
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,920
reverses to the top of my head that's

2219
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,920
to make sure it works thank you for the 10

but yes em I am a very strong

2232
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,920
believer in

2233
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,920
em the girls earn the money

2234
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,920
they get to keep the lines share

2235
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,920
em

2236
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,920
because I don't

2237
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,920
I don't think it's very nice

2238
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,920
if the girls were only earning

2239
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,920
like the standard 50-50 rate

2240
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,920
like what's your motivation to work

2241
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,920

other than like handing you the model because

2245
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,920

2246
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,920
again

2247
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,920

2249
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,920
even put anything in it

2250
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,920
thank you for the the super chat

2251
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,920
you didn't even put anything in it

2252
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,920
can you have a rave party with your

2253
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,920
hair, Neil

2254
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,920
I can't do anything else with my hair other than

2255
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,920
Toggle

2256
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,920
I just like hearing my name spoken with a Scottish accent

2257
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,920
you should teach others how to speak like that

2258
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,920
I think it could be a thing

2259
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,920
well she'd be starting to develop a

2260
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,920
not a pretty decent Scottish accent

2261
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,920
em

2262
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,920
I don't know how much she used to watch me

2263
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,920
wink wink

2264
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,920
em but she certainly gives

2265
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,920
an impression she's listened to me for a decent

2266
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,920
amount but when we were playing

2267
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,920
Gartik phone and

2268
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,920

2270
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,920

I wouldn't mind doing a Scottish

2291
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,920

2292
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,920
but I've got the Scottish game

01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,920

raw swordfish

an hour and see how many swordfish we are

2326
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,920
because I don't know how fast I can

2327
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,920
like get through these

2328
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,920

01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,920

2333
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,920

2334
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,920

2335
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,920
annunciate burglar

2336
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,920
burglar

2337
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,920
the box at the top left tells you how fast

2338
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,920
a thousand

2339
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,920
a thousand per hour

2340
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,920
so we will finish the swordfish

2341
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,920
I think we might be able to finish

2342
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,920
the swordfish if I don't get distracted

2343
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,920
and don't need to like

2344
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,920
go make too many teas

2345
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,920
I think at the three hour mark

2346
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,920
we'll take a toilet break

2347
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,920
and I'll get some food

2348
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,920
because I don't have any food in the morning

2349
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,920
like I just I wake up and I come on

2350

um

2353
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,920

2354
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,920
one an hour one K an hour

2355
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,920

2359
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,920
by the end of the stream we'll finish

2360
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,920

2384
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,920

2394
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,920

2400
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,920

2401
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,920

but

2409
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,920
you only wear killets during special events

2410
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,920
like weddings are probably the biggest

2411
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,920

2431
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,920
um

2432
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,920
ooh we're getting

2433
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,920
we're already at the

2434
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,920
10.3 we started at

2435
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,920
10.5

2436
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,920
ehh

2437
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,920
strongy shows up in Elden Ring like a blue

2438
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,920
power ranger am Scottish

2439
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,920
like that dress from

2440
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,920
DS1

2441
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,920
it's for the ventilation

2442
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,920
literally you cannot get swamp ass

2443
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,920
via a kill congrats

2444
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,920
um

2445
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,920
but your

2446
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,920
fatty bojangles will be bojangling

2447
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,920
I think

2448
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,920
I don't know how elastic

2449
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,920
yeah okay gimme is yelling out my door

2450
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,920
I can hear her go nuts

2451
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,920
she might start hammering on the door

2452
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,920
because she opens them by going up on her back legs

2453
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,920
and like pushing with her front paws

2454
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,920
so if you start hearing like

2455
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,920
that's her currently

2456
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,920
like opening the

2457
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,920
well attempting to open the door

2458
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,920
um

2459
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,920
you need to listen to this song

2460
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,920
donal where are your truzers it's a joke song about kills

2461
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,920
I'd play it but I'd probably get copyright

2462
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,920
ridiculous

2463
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,920
oh my burn rate is

2464
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,920
9%

2465
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,920
well hopefully that can get lowered because

2466
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,920
missing out on 10% xp

2467
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,920
on full inventories is rough

2468
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,920
is rough

2469
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,920
but we're getting there

2470
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,920
sorry how do I use it on the

2471
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,920
thing

2472
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,920
ta da

2473
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,920
let the boys be free as nature

2474
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,920
intended true

2475
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,920
yes I love wearing a kill always

2476
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,920
makes me feel confident I remember

2477
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,920
that one scene from the carry on films where the

2478
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,920

2479
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,920
to scare people

2480
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,920
I'm sure it probably

2481
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,920
like get it up here

2482
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,920

01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,920

01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,920
a level we're starting

2485
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,920
to get there

2486
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,920
where it's taking a wee

2487
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,920
minute but that's okay

2488
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,920
we've got lots of time

2489
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,920

I know I am aware

2511
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,920
that it is an interest

2512
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,920
in certain individuals

2513
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,920

well no sorry

2525
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,920

2526
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,920
someone wanted to pay me

2527
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,920
$200 to stream

2528
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,920

2530
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,920
but I don't go to the toilet

2531
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,920

2532
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,920

however

2540
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,920
it was rather interesting learning about that

2541
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,920
because that was the first time I had ever been exposed to it

2542
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,920

to them icy that when

01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,920
if and when you want to do a hand cam stream

2635
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,920

01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,920

2639
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,920
a emmy

2640
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:28,920
is sorry twins em

2641
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,920
emmy is doing her foot cam

2642
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,920
stream this week which is hilarious and I can't

2643
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,920
wait to see her little

2644
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,920
toes to nibble on

2645
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,920
em that's absolutely terrible

2646
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:40,920
I'm so sorry emmy I probably

2647
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,920
say the worst stuff about emmy

2648
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,920
but it's because

2649
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,920
em I'm

2650
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,920
I'm biased towards emmy's

2651
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,920
design the most because it's like

2652
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:52,920
if I had a lighter voice

2653
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,920
it's everything I want to be

2654
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,920
Gimli

2655
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,920
Gimli you need to give up

2656
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,920

2660
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,920
OG Sans question

2661
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,920
the worst part

2662
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,920
is that you're not even sorry

01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,920

I gave you that and then what

2705
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,920

2707
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,920
10,000 swordfish which was

2708
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,920
which was not cheap at all

2709
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,920
not cheap at all

2710
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,920
we are currently cooking through that and I am

2711
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,920
ranting and raving

2712
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,920
my head off

2713
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,920
emm just about anything and everything

2714
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,920
emm

2715
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,920
but yes I was currently gushing about

2716
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:00,920
the girls doing hand cam streams

2717
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,920
now that sheby's monetised

2718
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,920
I actually don't know when she's doing her monetisation stream

2719
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,920
emm

2720
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,920
hold on let me just

2721
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,920
let me just ask her when

2722
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,920
are you doing

2723
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,920
monetisation stream because I might need to put her monetisation

2724
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:16,920
live

2725
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,920
emm eeps

2726
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,920
eeps because I've not put her monetisation live

2727
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,920
emm and before you're like wait

2728
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,920
you control monetisation

2729
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,920
no in order for the girls to be less

2730
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:28,920
stressed I do the

2731
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,920
kind of boring stuff which is opening up

2732
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,920
memberships and setting it

2733
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,920
the price and adding her emotes to her

2734
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,920
badges for example

2735
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,920
emm hey fart head

2736
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,920
hey shit

2737
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,920
emm yes

2738
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,920
so if sheby plans on

2739
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,920
doing it the day

2740
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,920
I will have to quickly run away for 5 minutes

2741
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,920
and quickly set that up because I don't have

2742
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,920
access to her account

2743
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,920
on the cp your cash is

2744
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,920
20 times the cost of that swordfish though

2745
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,920
I know but I didn't do anything for the cash

2746
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,920
or the swordfish

2747
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,920
I just came I just got here

2748
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,920
emm

2749
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,920
wow level 60

2750
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,920
wow

2751
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,920
that's amazing

2752
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,920
frickin 60 how many

2753
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,920
are we burnt or burned

2754
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:16,920
percentage is going up

2755
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,920
cause I know swordfish is a bit harder than what was

2756
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,920
cooked

2757
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,920
we are still doing 1000 an hour

2758
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,920
it is possible

2759
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,920
I will beat the swordfish

2760
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,920
stack before

2761
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,920
emm

2762
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:32,920
eh

2763
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,920
just saying the chat that gave you the

2764
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,920
JP is 20 times killer than me

2765
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,920
emm yeah basic management

2766
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,920
tell me said

2767
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,920
emmy said she is doing it tomorrow

2768
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,920
yes emmy and I say I am putting their stuff

2769
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,920
live probably after

2770
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,920
the stream

2771
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,920
because I need it to go up 24 hours

2772
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,920
cause so youtube says they need to

2773
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:56,920
approve the membership tiers

2774
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:58,920
but they don't approve nothing

2775
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,920
they literally

2776
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,920
can go for it

2777
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,920
level 99 by the end of the stream trust

2778
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,920
just doing endurance stream right after closing the

2779
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,920
endurance stream honestly

2780
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,920
eh

2781
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,920
I could never do this I'm just giving it a

2782
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,920
shot it's always been a childhood dream

2783
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,920
of kinda like reaching 99

2784
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:18,920
in any level as you can

2785
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,920
see we haven't even touched any of the

2786
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,920
member skills but

2787
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,920
or my combat is so low

2788
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,920
but

2789
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:28,920
literally having it up here is really nice

2790
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,920
emm and I picked

2791
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,920
cooking because

2792
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,920
I have incredibly

2793
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,920
baby memories

2794
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,920
of me being outside the back of

2795
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,920
Lumberge castle

2796
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,920
and I had my

2797
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,920
pickaxe I had my tinder box

2798
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:46,920
I had my little basic

2799
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,920
bronze sword

2800
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,920
and I used to

2801
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,920
kill the big rats outside the

2802
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,920
back of the castle cook them

2803
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:56,920
and I think the highest cooking

2804
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,920
level I ever got was 40 as a child

2805
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:00,920
emm

2806
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,920
which is just freaking adorable

2807
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,920
which is why I want

2808
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,920
cooking 99 first cause I've just

2809
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,920
enjoyed it literally these gender

2810
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,920
norms have hands of course the wham

2811
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,920
and picks cooking oh we're about to get

2812
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,920
to 9000 the stack

2813
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,920
is getting weir it's getting

2814
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,920
smaller getting a wee wee

2815
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,920
stack burnt swordfish

2816
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,920
is probably worth more than cooked

2817
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,920
on the open market these burnt food

2818
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,920
collectors are pretty oh I'm aware

2819
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,920
about the burnt food collectors

2820
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,920
emm and they just give you

2821
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,920
a price for it which is pretty crazy

2822
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,920
emm

2823
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,920
fire making is probably the next

2824
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,920
fast this is winter tot

2825
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,920
yes that was a ghost

2826
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,920
fires in winter tot or am I making

2827
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,920
that up

2828
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,920
I might be making that up I'm gonna be

2829
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,920
going crazy

2830
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,920
emm

2831
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,920
my current level is 60

2832
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,920
on the dot

2833
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,920
I did title the stream 70 question

2834
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,920
mark but someone did

2835
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:00,920
napkin math and said if I finish

2836
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,920
cooking all these swordfish

2837
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,920
I might be 78

2838
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,920
which is just fantastic

2839
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,920
truly

2840
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,920
emm

2841
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,920
but I thought the cooking thing was a

2842
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,920
meta meme like mommy knows how to cook

2843
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,920
there is the proof I mean honestly we could

2844
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,920
do it that way as well but I kind of did it

2845
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,920
is like oh these gender norms have hands

2846
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,920
I just really enjoy cooking like I know

2847
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,920
there's this in real life

2848
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:26,920
runescape chick and she has

2849
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,920
massive knockers I'm talking

2850
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,920
a zero level knockers and I used

2851
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,920
to just sit and watch her cook

2852
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,920
lobsters and like so many

2853
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,920
people would come in the chat and say such

2854
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:38,920
horrendous things when would be the best

2855
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,920
food for winter tot so we

2856
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,920
keep all gimli

2857
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,920
give it a rest darling I can't

2858
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,920
have you in the room

2859
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:48,920
she's up she's losing it

2860
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,920
she's losing it

2861
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,920
I don't know if it's coming up in the microphone

2862
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,920
or not but she's losing it

2863
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,920
this is I shouldn't have let her in

2864
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,920
because now it's going to take a couple of days

2865
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,920
for her to unlearn that she's allowed in

2866
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,920
this room gimli

2867
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,920
I can't hear her okay she's currently behind

2868
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,920
the door going

2869
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:10,920
basically

2870
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,920
um

2871
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,920
she should have given up by now

2872
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,920
it's been

2873
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,920
it's been quite a while she should have gone

2874
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,920
to sleep I wouldn't be honest

2875
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:22,920
I should have

2876
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:24,920
played with her more but I ran out of time

2877
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:26,920
because I was making a cup of tea but I did feed her

2878
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:28,920
and I threw the mouse

2879
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,920
a few times to give her a few laps around to

2880
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,920
her dog she's not a dog

2881
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:34,920
she's a cat

2882
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,920
hmm heaven

2883
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,920

2889
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,920
excited when I finish a stream

2890
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,920

01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,920

cat girl is someone from Gimli

2913
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:38,920
I was actually gonna do

2914
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,920
an in real life video

2915
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,920
where I put um

2916
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:44,920
a licky lick on the 3D

2917
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:46,920
ears and then both my cats will lick it

2918
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,920
but I don't know if

2919
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:50,920
YouTube will be weird about it because

2920
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,920
I don't know what's going on

2921
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,920
what you're looking in YouTube right now

2922
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,920
it's absolutely terrifying

2923
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:58,920
um

2924
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,920
I don't

2925
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,920
keep messing that up sorry oh my god

2926
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:04,920
I'm not I'm not time maxing

2927
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,920
okay she's now knocking on the door

2928
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:08,920
Gimli

2929
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,920
don't do that

2930
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,920
ah mum he's no impressed Gimli

2931
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,920
didn't he do that I shouldn't have let her in yesterday

2932
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,920
it's opened a can of worms

2933
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,920
oh

2934
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,920
oh

2935
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,920
um but yeah

2936
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,920
can we see them the next hand cam

2937
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,920
you saw Gimli's back

2938
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,920
in the foot

2939
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,920
in the celebration stream near the end of it

2940
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,920
you saw Gimli come in the room

2941
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,920
but I had to take her out because she was gonna knock over the webcam

2942
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,920
um

2943
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:40,920
I do have a picture of them

2944
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,920
um they killed a rat

2945
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:44,920
um

2946
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:46,920
so I thought Gimli was the hunter

2947
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,920
but no

2948
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,920
Vigo was the hunter

2949
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,920
he caught a rat in the garden

2950
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:54,920
I don't even know

2951
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:56,920
it was there and he

2952
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:58,920
destroyed it so quickly

2953
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,920
um

2954
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,920
I'm pretty sure he like

2955
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,920
so if he didn't know the way that cats hunt

2956
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,920
is they apply pressure

2957
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,920
on the throat of the

2958
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,920
prey

2959
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,920
so basically it gets

2960
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,920
either suffocated or you know

2961
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,920
damaged out which is a shame to say

2962
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,920
Vigo

2963
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,920
I let him out in the garden

2964
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,920
and within 10 seconds

2965
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,920
he had perished

2966
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,920
the rat

2967
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:28,920
I didn't, I have a picture of it

2968
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,920
I'll maybe post it but I know people don't

2969
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,920
like seeing dead animals so maybe it's not too nice

2970
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,920
maybe I'll put like

2971
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,920
a little black bar over the rat's eyes

2972
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:38,920
just to protect its identity

2973
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,920
you know

2974
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,920
and eat and respect its wee family

2975
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,920
um

2976
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,920
damn though, put it in my base

2977
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:48,920
cat almost knocks you

2978
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,920
honestly

2979
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:52,920
um

2980
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,920
wait, cat almost knocks me

2981
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,920
are you that fucking fanny

2982
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,920
honestly, if you are, go and just leave me alone

2983
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,920
um

2984
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,920
but yeah we

2985
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,920
uh

2986
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,920
wee family, wee Vigo

2987
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,920
mmm

2988
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,920
is there somewhere we can

2989
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,920
send cat pics? I mean you can just

2990
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,920
at me

2991
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,920
it's fine on twitter

2992
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,920
uh

2993
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,920
honestly

2994
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,920
honestly honestly

2995
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,920
my cat is being a menace

2996
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:28,920
to the local bird population

2997
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,920
it's illegal to let your

2998
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:32,920
cats outside in Australia

2999
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,920
or I don't know if it's just

3000
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:36,920
in Victoria

3001
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,920
but it's illegal to let them out

3002
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,920
so I have a

3003
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,920
caged off

3004
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:44,920
which is such a shame

3005
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,920
but I'd rather they get outside time

3006
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,920
than no outside time at all because I actually don't think

3007
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,920
it's natural for cats to be inside

3008
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:52,920
um

3009
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,920
but yeah, they made it illegal

3010
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,920
um

3011
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,920
Australia does have a wild cat problem

3012
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,920
oh my god, it's so sad

3013
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:04,920
I wish I didn't learn about it

3014
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,920
but they basically call wild cats

3015
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:08,920
instead of just doing capture and release

3016
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:10,920
because it's like so out of control

3017
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,920
type thing

3018
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,920
and I'm like

3019
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,920
although it's kind of like learning about cat island

3020
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,920
in Japan, there's

3021
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,920
a tourist state island called cat island

3022
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,920
but the problem is

3023
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,920
none of the cats are fled or looked after

3024
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,920
or new urge so the population is completely

3025
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,920
out of control

3026
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:32,920
oh my god, Gimli

3027
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,920
she's doing my head and

3028
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,920
oh my god

3029
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,920
Gimli

3030
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,920
I know

3031
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:44,920
you guys might not be able to hear her

3032
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,920
she's going absolutely berserk right now

3033
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,920
she should have given up like a long time ago

3034
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,920
and gone back to sleep

3035
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,920
what have I done? I've created a monster

3036
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,920
because nobody wants to see Marshal no more

3037
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,920
he's chop level

3038
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,920
I don't know the rest of the words

3039
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,920
oh my god

3040
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,920
I can't think when she's me on

3041
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,920
wait hold on

3042
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,920
right

3043
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:14,920
I don't need to do her monetization

3044
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,920
of the

3045
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,920
video

3046
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:22,920
okay I don't need to worry

3047
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,920
about sheepsters but

3048
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,920
I will be putting M.A. and A.C.'s

3049
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,920
thing live

3050
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,920
praying that a speller member names right

3051
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,920
but I'm pretty sure it's

3052
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:34,920
Snow Bear

3053
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,920
Ease

3054
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,920
and

3055
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,920
Pin Pals

3056
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:42,920
and

3057
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,920
to be further driving the berserk thing

3058
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,920
I just think it's very

3059
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:52,920
dramatic

3060
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,920
you've been telling me I've been breaking the law

3061
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,920
for the past 23 years and didn't know

3062
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,920
apparently it's going to slow

3063
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,920
and England just made it

3064
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,920
that your cat has to get microchipped

3065
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:04,920
now

3066
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,920
and I'm like interesting

3067
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,920
but what's the real reason behind

3068
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:10,920
that because is it just

3069
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:12,920
another tax on pet owners

3070
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:14,920
oh if you're a pet

3071
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,920
owner and you need to use litter

3072
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,920
by the way like a litter box

3073
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:20,920
you know how it's really expensive for litter box

3074
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,920
like pellets

3075
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,920
and all that

3076
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,920
play sand

3077
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:28,920
cats love to take big massive dookies in play sand

3078
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,920
which is the cheapest thing ever

3079
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,920
it lasts so long

3080
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,920
especially if you can have an outside litter

3081
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,920
tray for them if they have access to outside

3082
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,920
you will save

3083
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:40,920
literally hundreds upon thousands

3084
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,920
of dollars over the years

3085
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,920
it costs

3086
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:46,920
eight dollars for a bag of sand

3087
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:48,920
and it costs 20

3088
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:50,920
for a decent cat grit

3089
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,920
just give them sand they love it

3090
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:54,920
you can scoop it it's super good

3091
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,920
and it saves your pockets

3092
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,920
so much money

3093
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:00,920
because there's such a tax

3094
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:02,920
on pet owners

3095
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:04,920
the only thing I haven't figured out yet

3096
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,920
is how to get good quality food

3097
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,920
because

3098
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,920
I was actually thinking of making like

3099
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,920
homemade cat

3100
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:14,920
the fire is gone

3101
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,920
no

3102
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,920
rifling what happened

3103
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,920
wait let me pick up the ashes hold on

3104
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,920
oh wait I can't I've got too much swordfish

3105
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,920
wait hold on hold on

3106
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,920
I'll pick up the ashes and take them out of the way

3107
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,920
I need to put them out of the way okay

3108
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,920
now the ashes are out of the way

3109
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,920
no the embers have went out

3110
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:34,920
I've just picked up burnt fish as well by accident

3111
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:38,920
slim cuttles

3112
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,920
or strongy shady

3113
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,920
excellent cuttle stones bearer

3114
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:44,920
em always

3115
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,920
thought it would be cute to have a big chalky cat

3116
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,920
oh well thanks for the tip

3117
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,920
I can't even remember what the tip was

3118
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:52,920
thank you for putting the fire back on again replaying

3119
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:56,920
it's over

3120
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:58,920
they didn't kindle the fire now it's the age of darkness

3121
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,920
crazy concept

3122
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:02,920
go fish

3123
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:04,920
the riflings with happily taste test

3124
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,920
your homemade cat food

3125
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,920
yeah I've wanted to make homemade

3126
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:10,920
thank you for getting me back on the subject

3127
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,920
cause I completely forgot what I was rambling about

3128
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,920
em

3129
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,920
I wanted to make homemade cat food

3130
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,920
because they were struggling

3131
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,920
to eat like that pre-made stuff

3132
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:22,920
and the thing

3133
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,920
this sounds really bad

3134
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:26,920
but on the

3135
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:28,920
boxes of cat food it says not fit

3136
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:30,920
for human consumption

3137
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:32,920
okay

3138
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:34,920
now the reason why that alarms me

3139
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:36,920
is because I would never want to give my cat

3140
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:38,920
something that I couldn't eat

3141
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,920
and cats eat meat cats are

3142
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,920
wow

3143
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,920
61

3144
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,920
thank you

3145
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,920
thank you riflings for funding my cooking habit

3146
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,920
em

3147
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:52,920
eh yeah

3148
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,920
I just find it a bit

3149
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,920
hmm and sus

3150
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:58,920
that

3151
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,920
it's not fit for human consumption

3152
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,920
when the content is just

3153
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,920
supposed to be meat that's possible

3154
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,920
for cats to eat

3155
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:08,920
which I don't like

3156
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,920
VV buys a rotisserie chicken

3157
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,920
my cats didn't like

3158
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,920
Willy's chicken I fed them it

3159
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,920
actually you know

3160
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:18,920
who liked Willy's chicken more than

3161
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,920
my freaking cats

3162
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,920
the magpies which I've yet to name

3163
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:24,920
em it's

3164
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,920
a husband magpie

3165
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,920
a wife magpie

3166
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,920
and a daughter magpie

3167
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:32,920
that visits me

3168
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,920
oh no

3169

rifling

3170
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:38,920
oh no it's the rifling afk

3171
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:40,920
that normally does like the big log pile

3172
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:42,920
wait I'll clear away the ashes hold on

3173
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:44,920
there you go it's out of the way

3174
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:46,920
wah

3175
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,920
I keep clicking collect

3176
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,920
bank banker take that out

3177
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:52,920
then take it out raw

ooh we're at 9.8

3179
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,920

01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,920
we're so on fire

3181
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,920
praise the fire

3182
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:02,920

3183
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,920
em

3184
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,920
pet food in general is a rarity

3185
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,920
let alone

3186
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,920
affordability hmm

3187
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,920
it's like ridiculous pricing as well

3188
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:14,920
like I'm not happy with the price as well

3189
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:16,920
em but I thought it would be really cute

3190
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,920
to make like

3191
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,920
homemade cat food for them

3192
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,920
it wouldn't be the best but like I've seen

3193
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,920
this youtube channel

3194
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:26,920
I think it's called Joon's Kitchen

3195
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,920
and it's literally dedicated to feeding

3196
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:30,920
the cat's gourmet

3197
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,920
homemade food and it's the most adorable

3198
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:34,920
thing ever and I'm like that's what I want to do

3199
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,920
for Viko and Gimli

3200
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,920
em cats are hyper carnivores

3201
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,920

3202
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,920

I know you can't see the stats that I'm looking at

3274
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:30,920

in the side window

3276
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:36,920

01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:38,920

01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,920

I'm not a

3285
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,920
I'm not a secret kind of creator

3286
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,920
I'll show you what I see this is what I see

3287
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:58,920
on the video it hasn't updated

3288
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,920
the

3289
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:02,920
where is it

3290
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,920
it hasn't

3291
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:08,920
ah that would be too easy

3292
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,920
wouldn't that image

3293
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,920
make source

3294
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:14,920
this is just youtube

3295
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:16,920
stats video I guess

3296
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:18,920
ok

3297
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,920
and then pick this one on my desktop please

3298
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:26,920
is that it this video

3299
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,920
wow

3300
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:30,920
wow on air

3301
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:32,920
you see that

3302
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,920
holy

3303
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:40,920
on air

3304
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:42,920
that got pushed so much

3305
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,920
look at browse feature

3306
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,920
76%

3307
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,920
browse feature my goodness

3308
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:50,920
but look

3309
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:52,920
it says I got 300 subscribers for it

3310
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:54,920
the money hasn't updated because

3311
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:56,920
it takes like 48 hours for the money to show

3312
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:58,920
wow I didn't

3313
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,920
not expect that

3314
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,920
the fact the watch time

3315
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,920
is 1.8k hours

3316
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,920
if you didn't know to get monetized you need

3317
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:08,920
3k watch hours

3318
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:10,920
holy crap

3319
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,920
maybe gen 2

3320
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:14,920
should come out with an ASMR video before

3321
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,920
debut but kind of ruins the voice

3322
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,920
although saying that you hear the voice in the trailer

3323
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,920
in the shorts anyways that's not much of a deal

3324
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:22,920
because it might help with the culling if the girls

3325
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,920
came out with an ASMR video for gen 2

3326
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:26,920
um

3327
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,920
nice when quality is rewarded

3328
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:30,920
but look at that

3329
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:32,920
browse feature source

3330
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:34,920
that's pretty nice

3331
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,920
sorry my tongue is rumbling

3332
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:38,920
if you heard that

3333
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:40,920
um literally

3334
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,920
I've not even got my first thank you for

3335
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:44,920
1k out yet

3336
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:46,920
oh

3337
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,920
oh my god yeah

3338
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,920
wow I'm 5800

3339
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,920
I literally tweeted

3340
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,920
thanks for 5k yesterday holy crap

3341
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,920
that's insane

3342
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,920
your trailer

3343
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:00,920
hooked me pretty hard

3344
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,920
well I wasn't lying

3345
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,920
during debut and I was like you'll be eating good

3346
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,920
if you're an ASMR enthusiast

3347
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:16,920
it's unlikely I'll get that first

3348
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:18,920
video out today

3349
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,920
because I'm doing

3350
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:22,920
AC and Emmys membership when I get

3351
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,920
offline and then probably collapsing

3352
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:26,920
unless

3353
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:28,920
although I will say it's really fun editing

3354
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:30,920
my thank you

3355
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,920
videos because

3356
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:34,920
I'm not making it

3357
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:36,920
super professional and like editing out

3358
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:38,920
all the bumps I'm just lowering the bumps

3359
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,920
in that so it's still like on the same level

3360
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,920
the culling was so

3361
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:44,920
silly it was

3362
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:46,920
absolutely insane on AC

3363
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,920
I mentioned this yesterday

3364
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:50,920
so don't worry if you didn't hear it

3365
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,920
but AC got called

3366
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:54,920
1500 subscribers

3367
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,920
and on the same day

3368
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:58,920
I got called 700 subscribers

3369
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,920
even though she had more

3370
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:02,920
shorts out like I was pushing shorts

3371
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,920
on AC

3372
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,920
at the time

3373
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:08,920
that's just crazy

3374
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:10,920
do you love a cheeky bit of ASMR

3375
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:14,920
it was so rough

3376
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:16,920
on AC but she's been doing fantastic

3377
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:18,920
honestly

3378
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:22,920
I am

3379
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,920
still interested

3380
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,920
in a clipper program for the girls

3381
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:30,920
I'm just waiting for the first month

3382
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:32,920
of income to come in and then I can

3383
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,920
kind of open up pie charts and be like

3384
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,920
right is this going to be

3385
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,920
possible for Vehler to do

3386
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:40,920
a clipping program like Idol N has done

3387
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:42,920
because I really like it I think it's a really

3388
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:44,920
good way to get clippers involved

3389
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:46,920
and help promote the girls

3390
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:48,920
and all that jazz

3391
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:50,920
I think it's fantastic so

3392
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:52,920
we are still looking into that

3393
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:54,920
and hopefully it will give the girls a cheeky boost

3394
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,920
I've had to resub three times

3395
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:02,920
I had to

3396
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:04,920
subscribe back onto the girls at one point as well

3397
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:06,920
I was like bruh we were

3398
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:08,920
literally all each other's first subscribers

3399
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:10,920
and I got booted off and I'm like great

3400
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:12,920
you've stolen it from me

3401
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,920
absolutely stolen it

3402
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:18,920
I hope those missing

3403
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:20,920
1500 OG suns

3404
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:22,920
find their way to her

3405
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:24,920
honestly though

3406
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:26,920
I'm sure they will I'm sure they'll be like hey

3407
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:28,920
wasn't there a cute polar bear around here at one point

3408
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:30,920
if

3409
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,920
you interact with the content

3410
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,920
like leave a like on stream or leave a comment

3411
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:36,920
then the algorithm

3412
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:38,920
will show the girl more to you

3413
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:40,920
so if you are

3414
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:42,920
an OG sun you're like

3415
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,920
her streams are never showing up please do consider

3416
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:46,920
like just going on her

3417
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:48,920
short feed for example

3418
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:50,920
wait don't like this stuff

3419
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:52,920
right away like genuinely sit and watch it

3420
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:54,920
because if you don't sit and watch it

3421
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:56,920
then the algorithm knows that you

3422
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,920
are just sitting there

3423
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,920
it's really annoying but the algorithm

3424
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:02,920
is now too advanced

3425
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,920
because

3426
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,920
before way back and much older

3427
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:08,920
YouTube days if you left the like

3428
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:10,920
you left the like

3429
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:12,920
but now the algorithm is like

3430
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:14,920
this person left the like at the 2 minute mark

3431
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:16,920
maybe something interesting

3432
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:18,920
happened 2 minutes in

3433
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:20,920
okay because of that statistic we're gonna now

3434
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:22,920
promote this video

3435
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,920
to people who

3436
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:26,920
have interacted with this

3437
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,920
VTuber because they're related or something

3438
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,920
like the algorithm just gets so

3439
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:32,920
silly

3440
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,920
I'm dying for the Hypno Viz

3441
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:36,920
the Hypno Viz can actually

3442
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,920
go on YouTube. YouTube allows Hypnosis

3443
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:40,920
Patreon doesn't

3444
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,920
make it make sense

3445
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:44,920
but we love YouTube out here for that reason

3446
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:48,920
it's very strange

3447
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,920
very very strange

3448
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,920
probably the first hit

3449
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,920
sorry here take this burnt

3450
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:56,920
burnt swordfish

3451
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,920
the first ASMR

3452
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,920
I'm gonna do is forget your name

3453
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:02,920
and replace it with Reefling

3454
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:04,920
um

3455
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:06,920
I will not

3456
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,920
make it a permanent effect

3457
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:10,920
I will make it

3458
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,920
a session I think maybe a 30 minute

3459
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:14,920
session if you will

3460
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:16,920
um

3461
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,920
and I'll give maybe give it

3462
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:20,920
like 2 hour effect I really

3463
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:22,920
do not want to do mess around with permanent

3464
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:24,920
effects too much it kind of scares me

3465
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,920
permanent effect stuff I have to be honest

3466
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,920
I'm a bit of a scaredy cat

3467
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,920
ooh our burn percentage is up to

3468
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,920
15

3469
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:34,920
I think it's holding steady at 15 though

3470
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:36,920
and hopefully

3471
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:38,920
lower as we get more

3472
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:40,920
leveled up

3473
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:42,920
um wait no Hypnosis

3474
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:44,920
no Hypnosis is

3475
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:46,920
ban it is a

3476
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,920
bannable um

3477
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:50,920
offense suspendable

3478
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,920
if you will um

3479
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:54,920
there was a ASMR

3480
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:56,920
artist actually that got their entire

3481
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:58,920
Patreon taken down not even

3482
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:00,920
a chance to

3483
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:02,920
um appeal

3484
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,920
or uh get suspended

3485
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:06,920
and then delete the content sometimes

3486
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:08,920
Patreon will suspend your account

3487
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:10,920
until you

3488
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:12,920
your content applies to their

3489
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:14,920
TOS so if it's not too offensive

3490
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:16,920
whatever you've done or made

3491
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:18,920
um but there wasn't ASMR

3492
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:20,920
recently who got their entire thing just

3493
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:22,920
taken down which was pretty

3494
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:24,920
crazy just making me

3495
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,920
permanently less procrastinate

3496
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,920
yeah honestly only

3497
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,920
a bit of mind break I feel

3498
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:32,920
you yeah

3499
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:34,920
chubby uh weight gain

3500
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,920
that got taken away

3501
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:38,920
um which was

3502
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:40,920
crazy absolutely crazy

3503
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,920
I'm not sure

3504
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,920
I mean I

3505
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:46,920
I can

3506
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:48,920
see why

3507
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:50,920
because sometimes the stuff is like tie down

3508
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:52,920
to a chair and funnel fed or whatever but

3509
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:54,920
it just gets

3510
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:56,920
ridiculous because whoever's participating

3511
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:58,920
or creating especially for when it comes

3512
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:00,920
to audio side of stuff like no visuals

3513
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:02,920
no nothing like

3514
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:04,920
it gets pretty ridiculous like

3515
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:06,920
that you can't do it like

3516
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:08,920
but anyway uh all healer

3517
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:10,920
mastercard overlords

3518
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:12,920
yes yes yes yes yes you win

3519
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:14,920
yeah again you win you win again

3520
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,920
hey ho you win again

3521
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:18,920
um

3522
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,920
who's thinking up all these rules and

3523
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:24,920
restrictions are overlords

3524
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:26,920
don't you not know about them

3525
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:28,920
see there's this company called black rock

3526
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:30,920
and then there's a second company called

3527
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:32,920
I've forgotten the name of the second company

3528
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:34,920
and they own everything um

3529
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:36,920
and uh

3530
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:38,920
oh wait until you learn about politics

3531
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:40,920
oh my goodness can't wait to get started

3532
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:42,920
about the political

3533
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:44,920
side of thing and no I'm not getting into politics

3534
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:46,920
but I'll get into destroying the

3535
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:48,920
economy and we should restart

3536
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:50,920
society or run away to

3537
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:52,920
a farm together I'm more

3538
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:54,920
opting for the farm side of things

3539
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:56,920
um

3540
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:58,920
because yeah I think the farm

3541
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:00,920
would be a heck of a lot better option

3542
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,920
um

3543
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:06,920
CNC is not okay

3544
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:08,920
with Patreon which happens yes

3545
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:10,920
we are 62

3546
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:14,920
thank you 62 it's

3547
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:16,920
nice to see you 62

3548
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:18,920
um

3549
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,920
but yes um

3550
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:22,920
so people from an outside

3551
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:24,920
perspective think

3552
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:26,920
hypnosis um

3553
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:28,920
you don't do anything you

3554
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,920
don't want to do when it comes to hypnosis

3555
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:32,920
I am a full believer in that

3556
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:34,920
I absolutely do not think

3557
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:36,920
but because of the way it seemed

3558
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:38,920
comedically in the public eye like

3559
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:40,920
for example when a magician

3560
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:42,920
does hypnosis oh look

3561
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:44,920
they made this person drink a bottle

3562
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:46,920
of vinegar type thing

3563
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,920
um because it's seen that way

3564
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:50,920
publicly when the reality is

3565
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:52,920
when you participate in

3566
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:54,920
an alternative context

3567
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:56,920
you do not do anything you don't want to do

3568
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:58,920
this is a fact it's just

3569
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:00,920
how it works you

3570
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:02,920
like people seem to think

3571
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:04,920
like you completely just like oh

3572
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:06,920
you're inhibitions you can't control

3573
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,920
anything you're so and it's like no

3574
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:10,920
mother that's not

3575
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:12,920
how it is

3576
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:14,920
all reeflings

3577
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:16,920
all together and put a money in

3578
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:18,920
oh should we buy a castle

3579
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:20,920
should we

3580
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:22,920
where should we what country

3581
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:24,920
though I want to see a castle

3582
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:26,920
in Scotland but um it's very hard

3583
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,920
to although saying that if we

3584
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,920
had a green a glass house

3585
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:32,920
a greenhouse then we

3586
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:34,920
could have tons of um

3587
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:36,920
produce maybe

3588
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:38,920
we should get a castle in Scotland

3589
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:40,920
and then we can have

3590
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:42,920
a big garden and we have like we feast

my special honey tea

3660
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:16,920
oh my god yes

3661
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:18,920
um in

3662
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:20,920
February I know February

3663
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:22,920
so far away but I actually have a meta

3664
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:24,920
audio roleplay month

3665
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:26,920
as well but yeah I'll

3666
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,920
make it my missing thing

3667
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,920
uh

3668
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:32,920
I do want to care for

3669
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:34,920
a little garden yes

3670
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:36,920
so um there's a lot of hardy

3671
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:38,920
plants so hardy plants are

3672
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:40,920
considered plants that can tolerate

3673
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,920
close to frost or very

3674
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:44,920
low temperatures

3675
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:46,920
um these hardy plants

3676
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:48,920
are things such as potatoes

3677
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:50,920
leaks these root vegetable

3678
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:52,920
type things um

3679
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:54,920
what's another root vegetable turnip

3680
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:56,920
very big um neeps and

3681
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:58,920
varieties um

3682
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:00,920
is turnips and potatoes

3683
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:02,920
these are very successful

3684
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:04,920
hardy plants in Scotland

3685
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:06,920
so these are probably what we'll focus on

3686
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:08,920
and make up the main majority

3687
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:10,920
um berries, strawberries

3688
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:12,920
um and

3689
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:14,920
blackberries for example

3690
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:16,920
these berries are actually quite

3691
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:18,920
successful in Scotland

3692
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:20,920
against all odds

3693
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:22,920
um because

3694
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:24,920
they're quite resistant um

3695
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:26,920
is really quite fascinating

3696
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:28,920
um there's a lot of strawberry

3697
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,920
production and manufacturers in

3698
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:32,920
Scotland if you didn't know that

3699
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:34,920
a little fun factoid

3700
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:36,920
um

3701
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:38,920
potatoes, boil and mash them

3702
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,920
stick them in a stew and we make

3703
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:42,920
a big dinner and we have nice

3704
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:44,920
yummy dinners every night

3705
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:46,920
um a carrots

3706
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:48,920
yes carrots a fantastic example

3707
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:50,920
a ground vegetable yes yes yes

3708
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:52,920
um

3709
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:54,920
wow

3710
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:56,920
9.4

3711
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:58,920
we're about to hit 9.3

3712
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:00,920
we're about to hit 8 we're getting so close

3713
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:02,920
we're getting so close

3714
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:04,920
uh gollum would be fuming right now

3715
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:06,920
so the leaks are a winter crop yes

3716
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:08,920
um

3717
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:10,920
and we can also have like garlic

3718
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:12,920
and I can teach you about the drying

3719
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:14,920
process of garlic as well

3720
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:16,920
um but we would need a shed for that

3721
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:18,920
surely one of us

3722
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:20,920
we flings are like DIY

3723
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:22,920
and can make a shed although

3724
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:24,920
oh my god we're like getting two steps away

3725
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:26,920
from being Amish at this rate

3726
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:28,920
I've not even been funny because

3727
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:30,920
like the Amish are known for like building

3728
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:32,920
stuff really fast um

3729
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:34,920
but like I'm sure

3730
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:36,920
if all of us rooflings came together

3731
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:38,920
on the castle farm we could build

3732
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:40,920
a shed and then I can teach you all

3733
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:42,920
about garlic uh

3734
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:44,920
curing you need to dry out the

3735
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:46,920
garlic because if it's wet it

3736
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:48,920
will rot but if you dry it out

3737
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:50,920
successfully the garlic will last

3738
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,920
an entire year from

3739
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:54,920
harvest season to the next

3740
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:56,920
it will last an entire year it's absolutely

3741
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:58,920
fantastic and we need to get massive

3742
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:00,920
freezers to freeze all our produce

3743
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:02,920
so we can do massive meal preparation

3744
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,920
as well how big of a shed are we talking

3745
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:06,920
it would need to be decent

3746
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:08,920
um

3747
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:10,920
I'm too scared to learn about canning

3748
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:12,920
food because I've heard about

3749
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:14,920
it literally perishes people if you mess up

3750
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:16,920
the canning process however

3751
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:18,920
there's one process I really

3752
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:20,920
like and it's

3753
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:22,920
dehydrating

3754
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:24,920
food so you're left

3755
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,920
with the dry

3756
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:28,920
husk of the food basically

3757
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:30,920
but I trust that and

3758
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:32,920
apparently that stuff lasts

3759
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:34,920
20 freaking years if you

3760
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:36,920
put it away right

3761
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,920
dehydrating food lasts 20 years and I'm like

3762
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:40,920
oh my god

3763
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:42,920
um

3764
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:44,920
I'm like absolutely right this is

3765
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:46,920
just me being a weirdo I absolutely

3766
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:48,920
love the idea of like a zombie

3767
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:50,920
apocalypse now don't get me wrong

3768
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:52,920
I will perish within the first few days

3769
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,920
I will be bitten I'm sorry I'll just

3770
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,920
admit it there's no way I'm not that good

3771
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,920
I'm not that guy trust me I'm not

3772
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:00,920
that guy um

3773
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,920
but I really like the idea of like

3774
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:04,920
having food reserves and like

3775
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:06,920
um I think they're called

3776
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:08,920
a bug out bag yes

3777
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,920
a bug out bag

3778
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:12,920
um I

3779
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,920
freaking love the idea of a bug out bag

3780
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:16,920
and like all this like food that's like

3781
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:18,920
good to go is it MRE kits

3782
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:20,920
I wouldn't mind trying an

3783
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:22,920
MRE kit taste testing stream

3784
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:24,920
that would be funny like a hand cam

3785
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:26,920
MRE thing um

3786
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:28,920
that would be curious

3787
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:30,920
and then we can judge it from different places

3788
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,920
because apparently South Korea

3789
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:34,920
has the yummiest MRE kits

3790
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,920
uh America has neutral

3791
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:38,920
I think UK is neutral

3792
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:40,920
maybe France might have something better

3793
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:42,920
MRE

3794
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:44,920
clogs your intestines

3795
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:46,920
oh no does it

3796
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:48,920
I don't know

3797
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:50,920
oh like space food just add water yeah

3798
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:52,920
like space food we can try space food

3799
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:54,920
as well when we try the MRE kits

3800
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:56,920
rating MRE kits live cam

3801
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:58,920
I just rate it and then like

3802
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:00,920
say like a bunch of like stereotypical stuff

3803
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:02,920
about the nation that I'm rating

3804
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:04,920
um

3805
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:06,920
my life wouldn't change if a zombie apocalypse

3806
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:08,920
happens just close

3807
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:10,920
in the house to it for seven

3808
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,920
yeah I really like the idea of

3809
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:14,920
dehydration food because

3810
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:16,920
it lasts years which is

3811
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:18,920
just a mind boggling thing

3812
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:20,920
to me like I absolutely love the concept

3813
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:22,920
of it um

3814
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:24,920
I just

3815
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:26,920
find it so fascinating that we could

3816
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:28,920
preserve foods like if you think

3817
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,920
of our ancestors who had to live

3818
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:32,920
on a yearly crop basis

3819
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,920
and like if your crops were

3820
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:36,920
messed up you were in trouble you had

3821
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:38,920
to find a trade quick like if

3822
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:40,920
you were a lumberjack and you cut wood

3823
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:42,920
or you sold

3824
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:44,920
I don't know you sold yourself

3825
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:46,920
but that trade really didn't

3826
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:48,920
uh still doing it today baby

3827
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:50,920
keeping

3828
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:52,920
my ancestors proud

3829
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:54,920
um if they're lumber

3830
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,920
um probably fire could chop

3831
02:12:56,920 --> 02:12:58,920
in probably root harvesting

3832
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:00,920
like harvesting mushrooms from a forest

3833
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:02,920
like if you knew what ones didn't hurt you

3834
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:04,920
um it's like

3835
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,920
4800 calories shoved into

3836
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:08,920
a box I wouldn't be surprised

3837
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:10,920
wait really maybe I should eat our MREs

3838
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:12,920
cause

3839
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:14,920
I don't eat properly recently

3840
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:16,920
I've been really strong I don't

3841
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:18,920
no ehh ehh ehh ehh ehh ehh

3842
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:20,920
reflin reflin reflin

3843
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:22,920
do not tape

3844
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,920
doom

3845
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:26,920
do not tape doom

3846
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:28,920
I will talk to you openly

3847
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:30,920
and honestly I've been struggling

3848
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,920
to eat a little bit until

3849
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:34,920
things settle down

3850
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:36,920
I'm very happy to

3851
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:38,920
say my A-bomb has calmed down

3852
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:40,920
it has calmed down

3853
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:42,920
it was preventing me

3854
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:44,920
from eating properly

3855
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:46,920
basically

3856
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:48,920
I could start eating but then I got

3857
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:50,920
adrenaline burst which stops

3858
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:52,920
me from eating cause I'm not hungry when I get

3859
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:54,920
an adrenaline burst

3860
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:56,920
but I'm very thankful to say it's subsiding

3861
02:13:56,920 --> 02:13:58,920
I've managed to eat a bit better

3862
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:00,920
recently

3863
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:02,920
but no doom

3864
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:04,920
no doom

3865
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:06,920
ok

3866
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:08,920
9.2

3867
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:10,920
oh we are doing it we're doing it

3868
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:12,920
the stack is going to be gone by the end of the stream

3869
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:14,920
mark my words

3870
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:16,920
you keep activating our worry mode which is why

3871
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:18,920
like I

3872
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,920
what level are you now I'm level

3873
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:22,920
62

3874
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,920
62 which is fantastic

3875
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:26,920
no doom here we're only winning

3876
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:28,920
glad to hear you're eating but yes

3877
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,920
so I because now the girls

3878
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:32,920
are getting monetized I feel

3879
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:34,920
a lot of relief

3880
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,920
a lot of like

3881
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:38,920
all of it off my shoulders cause

3882
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:40,920
I was worried that the designs

3883
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:42,920
that I had given Shibi and Azura

3884
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:44,920
are going to prevent them from earning

3885
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:46,920
money for a month but it's not

3886
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:48,920
happening I'm so happy to say

3887
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:50,920
it's not happening cause Shibi got monetized

3888
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:52,920
which is absolutely fan

3889
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:54,920
fantadelastic truly

3890
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:56,920
fantastic

3891
02:14:56,920 --> 02:14:58,920
I am very happy about that

3892
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:00,920
please take care of yourself

3893
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:02,920
yes I am doing thanks

3894
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:04,920
still feels like doom stop it

3895
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:06,920
reflying stop it no doom

3896
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:08,920
it was because

3897
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:10,920
I was so worried about monetization

3898
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:12,920
because

3899
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:14,920
the girls

3900
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:16,920
I've kind of said it

3901
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:18,920
a lot of them are wanting to

3902
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:20,920
move out

3903
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:22,920
and I think it's actually very

3904
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:24,920
possible

3905
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:26,920
for the first month but we needed

3906
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:28,920
youtube monetization just to really

3907
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:30,920
elevate it

3908
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:32,920
and the thing with youtube monetization

3909
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:34,920
as well is that the vods can be

3910
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:36,920
the vods

3911
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:38,920
the streams like if someone

3912
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:40,920
watches back the stream

3913
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:42,920
well the girls get like some of the money

3914
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:44,920
from the ads as well so it's like generated

3915
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:46,920
free income you do not have to actually

3916
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:48,920
physically you know

3917
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:50,920
hand over money to the girls

3918
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:52,920
because you generate money

3919
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:54,920
for free watching their asmr's

3920
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:56,920
their asmr's are going to go up shortly

3921
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:58,920
and I forgot to do mercedes

3922
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:00,920
I'll need to give mercedes hers that's what I'm doing

3923
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:02,920
I'll put emmy and ac's membership live

3924
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:04,920
and I'll put mercedes meme video

3925
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:06,920
unlisted so she can upload it whenever she

3926
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:08,920
desires

3927
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:10,920
and I'm gonna doom no no no

3928
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:12,920
no don't doom

3929
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:18,920
I have about a tiny speck of doom

3930
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:20,920
why would you doom everything is going so well

3931
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:22,920
the girls are getting monetized

3932
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:24,920
emmy and ac are about to do their celebration

3933
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,920
mercedes celebration was

3934
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:28,920
fantastic

3935
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:30,920
someone was gifting her 50 bombs

3936
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:32,920
which was insane

3937
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:34,920
no dooming on main literally

3938
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:36,920
no dooming on main

3939
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:38,920
everything is just gone

3940
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:40,920
so fantastic

3941
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:42,920
I tweeted out like thank you for 5k

3942
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:44,920
and I was saying like all that self-doubt

3943
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:46,920
and everything is just melting away

3944
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:48,920
which is true it has

3945
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:50,920
generate money for free

3946
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:52,920
yes oh my god

3947
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:54,920
please don't ever feel bad if you

3948
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:56,920
can't genuinely give money

3949
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:58,920
you don't understand

3950
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,920
you interacting with posts

3951
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:02,920
you're promoting them more in the algorithm

3952
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:04,920
you're watching their asmr

3953
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:06,920
if you watch an ad

3954
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:08,920
the girl gets money

3955
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:10,920
for that

3956
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:12,920
it is just

3957
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:14,920
please don't ever worry if you can't handle

3958
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:16,920
money

3959
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:18,920
I always say like oh I'm always streaming

3960
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:20,920
for free you don't have to be a member

3961
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:22,920
the membership streams start up next week

3962
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:24,920
but you don't have to be a member

3963
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:26,920
to consume at all

3964
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:28,920
type thingy

3965
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:30,920
scrawny I care about you and the girls too much

3966
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:32,920
I'm always gonna worry

3967
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:34,920
no you're sounding like me

3968
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:36,920
I was worrying over them

3969
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:38,920
I was like full mummy mode

3970
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:40,920
thankfully I got an 8 hour sleep

3971
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:42,920
last night

3972
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:44,920
oh my god

3973
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:46,920
why I probably sound

3974
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:48,920
a bit tired

3975
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:50,920
I woke up at the last possible minute

3976
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:52,920
for stream not because I don't

3977
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:54,920
love you because you guys always go

3978
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:56,920
mummy's late she doesn't love us anymore

3979
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:58,920
no I

3980
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:00,920
took medicine to put my ass to sleep

3981
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:02,920
and I got a full

3982
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:04,920
8 hours and I'm so freaking glad

3983
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:06,920
I got a full 8 hours I'm like

3984
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:08,920
oh I feel so good

3985
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:10,920
it feels so good to get a full 8 hours

3986
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,920
to sleep

3987
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,920
but yeah

3988
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:16,920
mummy loves us

3989
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:18,920
is the mercy meme video

3990
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:20,920
be a problem did youtube unlist it

3991
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:22,920
no it's not out yet

3992
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:24,920
I need to upload it to her channel because

3993
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:26,920
I subtitled all the meme videos

3994
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:30,920
63

3995
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:32,920
63

3996
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:34,920
63

3997
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:36,920
edgeville bank

3998
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:38,920
that was to the theme of 64 zoo lane

3999
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:40,920
which is a british TV show

4000
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:42,920
or was I don't know if they make new

4001
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:44,920
episodes but yeah

4002
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:46,920
so if we

4003
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:48,920
like commenting streams

4004
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:50,920
that helps yeah it helps like

4005
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:52,920
immensely like so

4006
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:54,920
to give you an example

4007
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:56,920
ic does an

4008
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:58,920
ASMR stream

4009
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:00,920
you like that stream

4010
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:02,920
and then emmy does an ASMR stream

4011
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:04,920
you like that stream

4012
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,920
youtube algorithm goes

4013
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:08,920
hmm there's a connection between

4014
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:10,920
these two girls they've both done

4015
02:19:10,920 --> 02:19:12,920
ASMR and this viewer both enjoyed

4016
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:14,920
them to leave a like

4017
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:16,920
and then the algorithm goes

4018
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:18,920
hmm this

4019
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:20,920
other youtube user

4020
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:22,920
both enjoyed these two girls

4021
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:24,920
I'm going to start recommending this

4022
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:26,920
user these girls

4023
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:28,920
em and then it's kind

4024
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:30,920
of a knock on effect so

4025
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:32,920
em

4026
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:34,920
youtube will recommend

4027
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:36,920
someone who's never consumed

4028
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:38,920
ic's ASMR before

4029
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:40,920
because they liked emmy's

4030
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:42,920
ASMR and then

4031
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:44,920
that also goes further ahead to

4032
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:46,920
other vtuber ASMRist for example

4033
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:48,920
the algorithm is like

4034
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:50,920
an insane tangled

4035
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:52,920
spider web of a mess

4036
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:54,920
em

4037
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:56,920
and anything you do will

4038
02:19:56,920 --> 02:19:58,920
affect it so for

4039
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:00,920
example

4040
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:02,920
if you go on twitter right now

4041
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:04,920
and you type in emmy bezu

4042
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:06,920
and it'll pop up her twitter

4043
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:08,920
you've just affected your algorithm on youtube

4044
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:10,920
because unfortunately

4045
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:12,920
em websites completely

4046
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:14,920
cross platform everything whatever

4047
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:16,920
you type in even if you go to

4048
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:18,920
rule 34 and type in

4049
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:20,920
the girls name you are

4050
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:22,920
you will affect the results

4051
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:24,920
of your youtube browsing experience

4052
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:26,920
because of what you've typed

4053
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:28,920
in on other websites as well

4054
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:30,920
em

4055
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:32,920
it goes

4056
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:34,920
very deep but unfortunately

4057
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:36,920
your websites are all interconnected

4058
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:38,920
whether or not you want to

4059
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:40,920
whether or not you say like no to

4060
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:42,920
cookies no to this they are connected

4061
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:44,920
it's undeniable em

4062
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:46,920
does youtube listen

4063
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:48,920
in the chat too so youtube

4064
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:50,920
will see

4065
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:52,920
you interacting with me on chat and it'll

4066
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:54,920
say this user like

4067
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:56,920
strony well em funny

4068
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,920

thing em sorry i'm not very good

02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:08,920
with my words at the moment em

4074
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:10,920
we'll probably

4075
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:12,920
we'll do a tinkle and a refuel

4076
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:14,920
at the 3 hour mark em

4077
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:16,920
i'm definitely going to make another tea

4078
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:18,920
and i'm going to get some yummy yummy snacks

4079
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:20,920
em

4080
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:22,920
i bought

4081
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:24,920
a nature valley bar and i'm like

4082
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:26,920
is that the worst snack to eat on stream

4083
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:28,920
there's just going to be dust everywhere

4084
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:30,920
are you stop looking at me misspelling

4085
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:32,920
your name how can you not

4086
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:34,920
strony kettles

4087
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:36,920
strony

4088
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:38,920
kettles

4089
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:40,920
strony kettles

4090
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:42,920
how can you spell it wrong

4091
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:44,920
but yeah like literally

4092
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:46,920
if you go on twitter

4093
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:48,920
and you search

4094
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:50,920
vealour

4095
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:52,920
again you're manipulating the algorithm

4096
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:54,920
when you go on youtube

4097
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:56,920
you'll probably have a few more vealour streams

4098
02:21:56,920 --> 02:21:58,920
recommended to you on your page

4099
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,920
or down the sidebar

4100
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:02,920
because the algorithm knows

4101
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:04,920
that you have an interest in vealour

4102
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:06,920
it goes so deep

4103
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:08,920
unfortunately cookies are just

4104
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:10,920
websites are such liars being like

4105
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:12,920
we don't track you via cookies

4106
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:14,920
only the essential ones you

4107
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:16,920
liar you liar it's just

4108
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:18,920
the way the internet is these days

4109
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:20,920
we're just such shame but

4110
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:22,920
em

4111
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:24,920
for the last week

4112
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:26,920
i've been getting ads regarding the scotland

4113
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:28,920
honestly

4114
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:30,920
come visit scotland

4115
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:32,920
this scotland tourism industry

4116
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:34,920
come to edum

4117
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:36,920
actually i think edum

4118
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:38,920
is the most expensive than glasgo

4119
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:40,920
although it's probably

4120
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:42,920
it's such a small amount

4121
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:44,920
of difference

4122
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:46,920
so if we're watching like scottish youtubers

4123
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:48,920
we should get more scottish youtubers

4124
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:50,920
em

4125
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:52,920
i actually don't know about getting

4126
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:54,920
really super rare

4127
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:56,920
imma just say this on behalf of all

4128
02:22:56,920 --> 02:22:58,920
scottish vtubers right now

4129
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:00,920
a lot has to go wrong in your life

4130
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:02,920
in order to become a scottish

4131
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:04,920
vtuber

4132
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:06,920
now to become a vtuber in general

4133
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:08,920
that's perfectly normal if you're any other nationality

4134
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:10,920
if you're scottish

4135
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:12,920
and a vtuber

4136
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:14,920
bruh whatever happened in your life

4137
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:16,920
i feel for you hen so if you're a scottish vtuber

4138
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:18,920
listening in i feel for you hen

4139
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:20,920
don't worry i went through it too

4140
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:22,920
ha ha

4141
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:24,920
you know

4142
02:23:24,920 --> 02:23:26,920
i am only

4143
02:23:26,920 --> 02:23:28,920
aware of two other scottish

4144
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:30,920
vtubers unfortunately

4145
02:23:30,920 --> 02:23:32,920
they are not for me

4146
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:34,920
content wise

4147
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:36,920
definitely not for me but that's just

4148
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:38,920
my yeah that's just me being me

4149
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:40,920
em

4150
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:42,920
definitely not on the same page

4151
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:44,920
when it comes to

4152
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:46,920
thought process

4153
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:48,920
or like how we were raised

4154
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:50,920
and all that

4155
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:52,920
you can kinda tell when you hear someone talk

4156
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:54,920
you can kinda tell

4157
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:56,920
the way they've been raised in scotland

4158
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:58,920
which sounds terrible

4159
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:00,920
sounds almost classic but i'm not trying to be like that

4160
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:02,920
i'm just trying to be like

4161
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:04,920
i don't know

4162
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:06,920
you can

4163
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:08,920
tell when someone doesn't gear

4164
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:10,920
and then you can tell when someone geyser

4165
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,920
and i'm much better with

4166
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:14,920
people who don't need geyser

4167
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:16,920
you know

4168
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:18,920
if i infect other people's algorithm

4169
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:20,920
em

4170
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:22,920
i suppose the only way

4171
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:24,920
you can do it

4172
02:24:24,920 --> 02:24:26,920
oh we're almost at 8k

4173
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:28,920
is

4174
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:30,920
by posting

4175
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:32,920
youtube shorts in particular

4176
02:24:32,920 --> 02:24:34,920
in locations where it's appropriate

4177
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:36,920
so just say you're in a general vtuber fan discord

4178
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:38,920
if someone were to

4179
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:40,920
watch that short fully

4180
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:42,920
you have successfully infected them

4181
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:44,920
algorithm wise

4182
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:46,920
em

4183
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:48,920
because they consumed

4184
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:50,920
that content it's fascinating

4185
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:52,920
honestly i actually am quite

4186
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:54,920
interested in the infection

4187
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:56,920
side of it but yes

4188
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:58,920
you can successfully infect someone

4189
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:00,920
the vealor virus

4190
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:02,920
em

4191
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:04,920
em

4192
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:08,920
em so i just

4193
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:10,920
wrote that comment

4194
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:12,920
yes you can affect someone by doing that

4195
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:14,920
if they have never consumed vealor content

4196
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:16,920
em

4197
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:18,920
but you maybe make clips

4198
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:20,920
of the girls and they click it for the first time

4199
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:22,920
because they got recommended or you post

4200
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:24,920
in a discord that's appropriate to post

4201
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:26,920
the vtuber stuff or maybe

4202
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:28,920
a vtuber reddit

4203
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:30,920
actually there i think there's

4204
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:32,920
so

4205
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:34,920
vealor do have the vealor reddit

4206
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:36,920
but it's not being publicly posted yet

4207
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:38,920
but i sh

4208
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:40,920
i don't know i mean literally i was just gonna

4209
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:42,920
do everyone's oh sorry

4210
02:25:42,920 --> 02:25:44,920
this is why i can't talk and think at the same time

4211
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:46,920
em

4212
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:48,920
there is a possibility of just posting it for memes

4213
02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:50,920
but we were gonna have to put it on approved

4214
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:52,920
posts only

4215
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:54,920
because it can get nasty pretty quickly

4216
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:56,920
em

4217
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:58,920
and i do not want any of the girls to be

4218
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:00,920
subjected to anything

4219
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:02,920
nasty

4220
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:04,920
let's go infect some replaying

4221
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:06,920
i have no idea what you're saying

4222
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:08,920
but i'll take your word for it thank you

4223
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:10,920
is edinburgh a bad place no it's not

4224
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:12,920
it's just more

4225
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:14,920
rich

4226
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:16,920
and sometimes rich people

4227
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:18,920
are not very empathetic

4228
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:20,920
em but that was such

4229
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:22,920
a mean and nasty generalization

4230
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:24,920
when i say rich people i'm talking like

4231
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:26,920
multi-billionaires

4232
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:28,920
multi-billionaires type stuff rich

4233
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:30,920
em the average do everyone's

4234
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:32,920
empathetic to one another each other

4235
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:34,920
but if you're not very empathetic please don't worry

4236
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:36,920
i'm actually gonna do an educational stream

4237
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:38,920
on human nature and empathy

4238
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:40,920
empathy is a practice behaviour

4239
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:42,920
you need to practice empathy to get it

4240
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:44,920
you need to

4241
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:46,920
flip the switch and be able to

4242
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:48,920
have abstract thoughts about empathy

4243
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:50,920
as a whole

4244
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:52,920
and i'm actually going to challenge you guys

4245
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:54,920
and i'm going to make up scenarios

4246
02:26:54,920 --> 02:26:56,920
where you need to be empathetic

4247
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:58,920
and you need to give me a reason why you feel empathetic

4248
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:00,920
but i'm going to make the scenario

4249
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:02,920
super hard so at a glance

4250
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:04,920
you're like that's disgusting behaviour

4251
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:06,920
that's

4252
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:08,920
but

4253
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:10,920
but we have to learn

4254
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:12,920
to be empathetic and we have to think

4255
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:14,920
about why the person

4256
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:16,920
may have behaved that way

4257
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:18,920
it'll be an interesting

4258
02:27:18,920 --> 02:27:20,920
concept either the stream will go terrible

4259
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:22,920
and everyone can laugh at it which is fine

4260
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:24,920
i don't mind you guys are allowed to laugh at my

4261
02:27:24,920 --> 02:27:26,920
stream ideas because i have a pretty bizarre

4262
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:28,920
concept sometimes

4263
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:30,920
oh man we have a place like that too

4264
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:32,920
in Milan never got Milan

4265
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:34,920
so it's like London but smaller and prettier

4266
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:36,920
yeah it's pretty old

4267
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:38,920
there's a lot of older architecture

4268
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:40,920
Edinburgh is turning people

4269
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:42,920
into an English city in regards to the most posh people

4270
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:44,920
i definitely

4271
02:27:44,920 --> 02:27:46,920
feel more comfortable in Glasgow

4272
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:48,920
and good old Glasgow

4273
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:50,920
mutual comfy

4274
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:52,920
disgusting and

4275
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:54,920
i'm going to pull the lever

4276
02:27:54,920 --> 02:27:56,920
and make everything worse

4277
02:27:56,920 --> 02:27:58,920
what does that mean

4278
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:00,920
the Scottish accents kind of come from

4279
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:02,920
yeah so

4280
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:04,920
the more slang you speak

4281
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:06,920
statistically the more povo you are

4282
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:08,920
and it's completely normal

4283
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:10,920
to be in poverty in Scotland

4284
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:12,920
the statistics

4285
02:28:12,920 --> 02:28:14,920
are 1 in 5 children

4286
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:16,920
are growing up in poverty

4287
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:18,920
however i actually think the statistics

4288
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:20,920
is probably going to be 1 in 3 now

4289
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:22,920
so it's

4290
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:24,920
completely normal to be

4291
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:26,920
impoverished when you grow up

4292
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:28,920
it's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary

4293
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:30,920
anyone's rich type ideal

4294
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:32,920
i like that

4295
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:34,920
i like human psychology

4296
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:36,920
that sounds pretty interesting

4297
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:38,920
are you trying to get us to empathize with some scoundrels

4298
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:40,920
no nothing bad

4299
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:42,920

4327
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:42,920
um

4328
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:44,920
is currently british english only a thing

4329
02:29:44,920 --> 02:29:46,920
wait sorry isn't current british english

4330
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:48,920
only a thing because they didn't want to be associated

4331
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:50,920
with the nobility of the plague

4332
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:52,920
yes there is a very

4333
02:29:52,920 --> 02:29:54,920
viral clip that

4334
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:56,920
a guy is being interviewed

4335
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:58,920
um

4336
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:00,920
and

4337
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:02,920
oh god what was the word

4338
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:04,920
i can see the interview in my head

4339
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:06,920
it's an english interview

4340
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:08,920
and the guy

4341
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:10,920
speaks what we call

4342
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:12,920
posh english

4343
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,920
and then the guy replies

4344
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:16,920
tomorrow that's it

4345
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:18,920
the guy goes like tomorrow

4346
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:20,920
and then the guy replies tomorrow

4347
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:22,920
it's like not trying to correct him

4348
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:24,920
but he's trying to be like wow

4349
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:26,920
look at the difference in this regional accent

4350
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:28,920
but the problem

4351
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:30,920
with it

4352
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:32,920
it's not that problematic relax before you're like

4353
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:34,920
well steady on you've got blue hair haven't you

4354
02:30:34,920 --> 02:30:36,920
nah relax i ain't got blue hair

4355
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:38,920
calm it fenny's in on the opposite of me

4356
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:40,920
um

4357
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:42,920
the kind of thing was it

4358
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:44,920
is because posh english accents

4359
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:46,920
are associated with wealth

4360
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:48,920
are associated with grammar schools

4361
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:50,920
for example a grammar school is

4362
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:52,920
a rich person school

4363
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:54,920
high education school

4364
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:56,920
public education is kind of

4365
02:30:56,920 --> 02:30:58,920
associated with not necessarily

4366
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:00,920
pro but if you can't afford public education

4367
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:02,920
you can't afford it

4368
02:31:02,920 --> 02:31:04,920
um

4369
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:06,920
so the guy was like oh

4370
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:08,920
look at this accent

4371
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:10,920
this man clearly

4372
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:12,920
you know wasn't educated

4373
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:14,920
in a grammar school type thing and that's

4374
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:16,920
when it becomes a wee bit of an issue

4375
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:18,920
uh received pronunciation

4376
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:20,920
uh

4377
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:22,920
it's them also calling it the queens english

4378
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:24,920
yeah just finding out

4379
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:26,920
it's not glass

4380
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:28,920
wait glass go

4381
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:30,920
it's a shame

4382
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:32,920
it's fine if you accidentally name a city wrong

4383
02:31:32,920 --> 02:31:34,920
like edinburgh

4384
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:36,920
and edinburgh is normally pronounced

4385
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:38,920
edinburgh

4386
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:40,920
by folk who don't come from here

4387
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:42,920
that's perfectly normal

4388
02:31:42,920 --> 02:31:44,920
i'm sure i say all these

4389
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:46,920
applications in different countries wrong as well

4390
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:48,920
like arkansas

4391
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:50,920
is arkansas and like

4392
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:52,920
mississippi and

4393
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:54,920
what's another state in america

4394
02:31:54,920 --> 02:31:56,920
um road islands

4395
02:31:56,920 --> 02:31:58,920
um colorado

4396
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:00,920
i'm sure i say it funny so please

4397
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:02,920
don't ever be embarrassed if you say it funny

4398
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:04,920
um glass go is said glass go

4399
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:06,920
but in the

4400
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,920
regional dialect it can also be

4401
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:10,920
glazga um

4402
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:12,920
don't ask why it's glazga it just

4403
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:14,920
glazga um

4404
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:16,920
texas yeah i'm sure i'll say

4405
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:18,920
uh i don't know

4406
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:20,920
if there's some locations

4407
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:22,920
in the states that i can name

02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:24,920
uh anaheim

4409
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:26,920
is a place in

4410
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:28,920
california because they

4411
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:30,920
hold conventions

4412
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:32,920
i'm pretty sure there was some

4413
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:34,920
anaheim convention at one point

4414
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:36,920

4415
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:38,920
glazga honestly it's

4416
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:40,920
like such a nice although edinburgh

4417
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:42,920
is pretty good for tourist stuff like

4418
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:44,920
the edinburgh castle and

4419
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:46,920
the edinburgh museum are pretty close together

4420
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:48,920
um

4421
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:50,920

4422
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:52,920
associated with posh no wheels

towns and all of that and the

4426
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:00,920

02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:10,920
specifically to start the accent

4431
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:14,920

4435
02:33:20,920 --> 02:33:22,920
britain skit where the guy's like

i'm the only gay in the village that's the only

4442
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:36,920
exposure to the welsh accent

4443
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:38,920
to be honest which is absolutely terrible

4444
02:33:38,920 --> 02:33:40,920
um all of a sudden

4445
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:42,920
we're drifting up to the northern island

4446
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:44,920
uh heavenly father

4447
02:33:44,920 --> 02:33:46,920
who art in heaven hello to be thy name

4448
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:48,920
today we're gathered with the reeflings

4449
02:33:48,920 --> 02:33:50,920
at hedgeville uh we're currently

4450
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:52,920
cooking up a storm with swordfish

4451
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:54,920
but we still have a high burn rate

4452
02:33:54,920 --> 02:33:56,920
my burn rate is 17 percent now are you

4453
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:58,920
joking why is my burn rate

4454
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:00,920
getting higher i'm leveling up

4455
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:04,920
wheels is associated with sheep

4456
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:06,920
i will tell you the reason why wheels are

4457
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:08,920
associated with sheep it was

4458
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:10,920
elite well it's illegal to

4459
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:12,920
steal a farmer's sheep it

4460
02:34:12,920 --> 02:34:14,920
wasn't at the time many a year

4461
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:16,920
ago to um to

4462
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:18,920
have um

4463
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:20,920
actions with a sheep

4464
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:22,920
which is why

4465
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:24,920
people would pretend

4466
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:26,920
that they had had action

4467
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:28,920
with a sheep instead

4468
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:30,920
of stealing it because you can't

4469
02:34:30,920 --> 02:34:32,920
get arrested for actions but you could

4470
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:34,920
get arrested for stealing at the time

4471
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:36,920
okay that is why

4472
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:38,920
poor welsh people have to deal with

4473
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:40,920
that stereotype and it's such a shame

4474
02:34:42,920 --> 02:34:44,920
um because it's not true you just

4475
02:34:44,920 --> 02:34:46,920
need to know a little bit of history to understand

4476
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:48,920
a little bit more

4477
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:50,920
abridonians profusely

4478
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:52,920
sweating aye what is it abridine

4479
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:54,920
abridine can he kick her jelly

4480
02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:58,920
absolutely short in behaviour

4481
02:34:58,920 --> 02:35:00,920
stealing was the death penalty

4482
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:02,920
yes okay that would be it

4483
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:04,920
it was even more severe than i originally

4484
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:06,920
had anticipated

4485
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:08,920
i shan't be in scottish i'm getting

4486
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:10,920

02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:20,920
because of each of our agency

4492
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:22,920
reasons you'll have to forgive me but

02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:24,920

someone's getting banned

4512
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:10,920

02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:12,920

4514
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:14,920

02:36:26,920 --> 02:36:28,920
collars do you have a heart rate monitor

4522
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:30,920
by the way i was gonna wear my heart rate monitor

4523
02:36:30,920 --> 02:36:32,920
so you can literally see my heart spike

4524
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:34,920
every time you go

4525
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:36,920
she hates me

4526
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:38,920
what if i die before you

4527
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:40,920

i honestly i love

4531
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:48,920
your 3d model streams i don't know how

4532
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:50,920
you're not exhausted by the end of it honestly

4533
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:52,920
i'd be shattered after like 30 seconds of

4534
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:54,920
moving around i'd be like right that's all i've got time for

4535
02:36:54,920 --> 02:36:56,920
it's been nice reflans but i gotta go

4536
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:58,920

4538
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:02,920

gonna get it done

4543
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:14,920
sin will always be

4544
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:16,920
a reflans

4545
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:18,920
did you kicked my

4546
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:20,920
toenail off the wall a few times

4547
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:22,920
um

4548
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:24,920
what a

4549
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:26,920
what's your community name again because i remember

4550
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:28,920
when i when i saw you getting started

4551
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:30,920
it had been

4552
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:32,920
named something

4553
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:34,920
but i don't know if you're still named

4554
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:36,920
that and i don't want to say the name

4555
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:38,920
okay it's imps now okay

4556
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:40,920
it was something else

4557
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:42,920
um it was something else

4558
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:44,920
way at the start and i didn't want to

4559
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:46,920
say it obviously

4560
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:48,920
can suspicion i know he's getting banned

4561
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:50,920
just do a couple of them clapping

4562
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:52,920
with no hands audio sounds like

4563
02:37:52,920 --> 02:37:54,920
you got a good workout and brah

4564
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:56,920
i was so out of breath recording

4565
02:37:56,920 --> 02:37:58,920
that like horrifically

4566
02:37:58,920 --> 02:38:00,920
out of breath

4567
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:02,920
like you can literally here we go

4568
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:04,920
like

4569
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:06,920
clap clap clap clap clap clap

4570
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:08,920
basically i was

4571
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:10,920
so bad

4572
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:12,920
i was so bad

4573
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:16,920
man

4574
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:18,920
what level did i just get 64

4575
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:20,920
64

4576
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:22,920
wait why can i not kick this

4577
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:24,920
yes oh my god it was

4578
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:26,920
64

4579
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:30,920
it was suggested

4580
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:32,920
sin cells that was it i didn't

4581
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:34,920
yeah i'm pretty sure it's an incel

4582
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:36,920
and um

4583
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:38,920
what's that other word simp

4584
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:40,920
like a ban phrase on twitch now

4585
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:42,920
do they still do that do they still

4586
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:44,920
moderate that

4587
02:38:44,920 --> 02:38:46,920
i remember it got banned and i was like

4588
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:48,920
isn't that

4589
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:50,920
like i don't like the word simp

4590
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:52,920
because i feel like it's used anytime

4591
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:54,920
where a guy just genuinely enjoys content

4592
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:56,920
from a girl which is so like it's quite

4593
02:38:56,920 --> 02:38:58,920
frustrating because it's just like

4594
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:00,920
i don't like the terminology

4595
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:02,920
but to like outright ban it

4596
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:04,920
is like what did i miss a few

4597
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:06,920
yeah twitch doesn't allow those words

4598
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:08,920
but i've never really tested it out

4599
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:12,920
you can get banned for it that's pretty

4600
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:14,920
um

4601
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:16,920
yeah like i'm pretty tired of the

4602
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:18,920
word simp because i think it's used whenever

4603
02:39:18,920 --> 02:39:20,920
someone just genuinely enjoys content

4604
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:22,920
that just happens to be from a chick like it's

4605
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:24,920
really

4606
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:26,920
but anyway i think outright ban in it is like

4607
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:28,920
a bit severe i just hope

4608
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:30,920
that the definition

4609
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:32,920
slowly changes over time did someone just

4610
02:39:32,920 --> 02:39:34,920
talk there no

4611
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:36,920
maybe later oh wait was that for me

4612
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:38,920
oh my god i wasn't paying attention

4613
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:40,920
ebes was that for me

4614
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:44,920
uh

4615
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:46,920
the moderation

4616
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:48,920
is inconsistent say the least

4617
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:50,920
yeah it's why i don't really enjoy

4618
02:39:50,920 --> 02:39:52,920
twitch a lot of people right why not

4619
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:54,920
twitch why not twitch but i have seen countless

4620
02:39:54,920 --> 02:39:56,920
examples of what

4621
02:39:56,920 --> 02:39:58,920
how they don't apply the rules

4622
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:00,920
fairly at least with youtube

4623
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:02,920
it does seem like

4624
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:04,920
a overall blanket

4625
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:06,920
which is very easy

4626
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:08,920
to be like oh okay right because

4627
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:10,920
like um now i'm aware

4628
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:12,920
that you're looking isn't allowed now

4629
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:14,920
i don't know why

4630
02:40:14,920 --> 02:40:16,920
older videos that are made eons back

4631
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:18,920
are fine but recently not

4632
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:20,920
no like azura was eating

4633
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:22,920
a cookie azura

4634
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:24,920
was eating a cookie and she got

4635
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:26,920
a warning for um enjoying

4636
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:28,920
a cookie just because her voice is so

4637
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:30,920
silky smooth um

4638
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:34,920
it's definitely being generalized to any sort of kindness

4639
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:36,920
towards a person but especially women

4640
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:38,920
yeah like it's why

4641
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:40,920
i'm i'm pretty tired of hearing about it

4642
02:40:40,920 --> 02:40:42,920
to be honest like i think it's overstate

4643
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:44,920
it's welcome to because it just

4644
02:40:44,920 --> 02:40:46,920
gets used to oh you enjoy

4645
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:48,920
any type of content from women

4646
02:40:48,920 --> 02:40:50,920
and it's like bro

4647
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:52,920
i'm just here to enjoy the runescape streams

4648
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:54,920
like my god i'm here to enjoy the rambles

4649
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:56,920
and how we're going to take down

4650
02:40:56,920 --> 02:40:58,920
the big banks um

4651
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:02,920
i prefer youtube twitch

4652
02:41:02,920 --> 02:41:04,920
reason sub prices oh my gosh

4653
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:06,920
yes at least with youtube you

4654
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:08,920
can decide on membership price i

4655
02:41:08,920 --> 02:41:10,920
see that as if i didn't begrudgingly

4656
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:12,920
raise my price by a dollar of

4657
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:14,920
pure rage but i will make it up

4658
02:41:14,920 --> 02:41:16,920

but yeah twitch

4662
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:24,920
just seems to be taking

4663
02:41:24,920 --> 02:41:26,920
a sin moving to youtube

4664
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:28,920
if you type in

4665
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:30,920
twitch that you're

4666
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:32,920

02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:36,920

02:41:38,920 --> 02:41:40,920
can't eat a cookie on stream

4671
02:41:40,920 --> 02:41:42,920
youtube is really crumbling apart

4672
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:48,920

myself i promise it totally

4679
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:04,920

02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:06,920
how is she looking how is she looking

4681
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:08,920
sideways is she supposed to be looking

4682
02:42:08,920 --> 02:42:10,920
sideways

4683
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:12,920
i just really she's never looking

4684
02:42:12,920 --> 02:42:14,920
why are you looking

4685
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:16,920
to the side i know maybe she got

4686
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:18,920
like a sore neck or something that's okay

4687
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:24,920
yeah i didn't miss the

4688
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:26,920
yeah

4689
02:42:26,920 --> 02:42:28,920
it turns out all i had to do was open

4690
02:42:28,920 --> 02:42:30,920
the application in order for it to make

4691
02:42:30,920 --> 02:42:32,920
noise i accidentally

4692
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:34,920
closed it the other time i tried it

4693
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:36,920
and couldn't figure out why

4694
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:38,920
she's so shy she can't look us in the eyes

4695
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:40,920
honestly like look into my eyes

4696
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:42,920
not around my eyes

4697
02:42:42,920 --> 02:42:44,920
yeah

4698
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:46,920
it's like when you see a guy call someone

4699
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:48,920
a simple watching girl and then you look

4700
02:42:48,920 --> 02:42:50,920
and they watch some big muscle male streamer

4701
02:42:50,920 --> 02:42:52,920
for nine hours a day but that doesn't

4702
02:42:52,920 --> 02:42:54,920
count

4703
02:42:54,920 --> 02:42:56,920
allegedly glorkin hard

4704
02:42:56,920 --> 02:42:58,920
on it but

4705
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:00,920
he's a whammin bad but male

4706
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:02,920
good

4707
02:43:02,920 --> 02:43:04,920

conspiracy through okay let's just enjoy him

4710
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:10,920
if it makes you

4711
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:12,920
a simp for listening to me

4712
02:43:12,920 --> 02:43:14,920
coconut my cheeks

4713
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:16,920
and make them clap for 15 minutes

4714
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:18,920
and hey ho

4715
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:20,920
then hey ho

4716
02:43:20,920 --> 02:43:22,920
snakes and stones may may break

4717
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:24,920
my bones but you'll never get

4718
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:26,920
more quality content

4719
02:43:26,920 --> 02:43:28,920
from another streamer

4720
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:30,920
when it comes to ASMR no that's a lie

4721
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:32,920
that's a lie

4722
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:34,920
oh 8.6

4723
02:43:34,920 --> 02:43:36,920
8.6

4724
02:43:36,920 --> 02:43:38,920
bronze

4725
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:40,920
my issue with twitch at the moment is

4726
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:42,920
something about the vtuber

4727
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:44,920
yes that was a recent tos update

4728
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:46,920
if you did not hear the news

4729
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:48,920
vtubers now

4730
02:43:48,920 --> 02:43:50,920
must

4731
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:52,920
conform

4732
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:54,920
to the attire

4733
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:56,920
rules of in real life streamers

4734
02:43:56,920 --> 02:43:58,920
but the problem with that is a lot

4735
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:00,920
of vtuber models you know

4736
02:44:00,920 --> 02:44:02,920
they have a bit of appeal to them

4737
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:04,920
a bit of personality on show if you will

4738
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:06,920
and because of twitch

4739
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:08,920
is incant who goes there

4740
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:10,920
inconsistencies

4741
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:12,920
it's very hard to ascertain

4742
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:14,920
if

4743
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:16,920
if

4744
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:18,920
oops sorry whoa

4745
02:44:18,920 --> 02:44:20,920
how do I do that

4746
02:44:20,920 --> 02:44:22,920
hold on I'm just gonna check

4747
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:24,920
if any of the girls

4748
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:26,920
are streaming

4749
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:28,920
please

4750
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:30,920
be advised

4751
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:32,920
that shibi

4752
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:34,920
cajun boom

4753
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:36,920

4754

4766
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:02,920
if you cannot watch us all

4767
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:04,920
once I heavily recommend watching

4768
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:06,920
the other girls first

4769
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:08,920
because I am locking in

4770
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:10,920

4771
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:12,920

I do appreciate all your hard efforts mods

please do not

4778
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:26,920
I've locked in for a 12 hour stream

4779
02:45:26,920 --> 02:45:28,920
you will not see me offline

4780
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:30,920
until 11 hours and 55 minutes

4781
02:45:30,920 --> 02:45:32,920
cause that is exactly when the vod breaks

4782
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:34,920
em

4783
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:36,920
so please do not be afraid to watch

4784
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:38,920
my gen mates and enjoy them

4785
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:40,920
and then you are welcome to

4786
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:42,920
come back to me at any time

4787
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:44,920
whoa this person got gardening

4788
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:46,920
gardening isn't got

4789
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:48,920
a freaking cabbage on your back

4790
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:50,920
aww you got green cakes

4791
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:52,920
aww I forgot to buy his green cakes

4792
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:54,920
we should probably buy green cakes

4793
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:56,920
aren't the twitch attire standards

4794
02:45:56,920 --> 02:45:58,920
based on what you are? doesn't that mean vtuber

4795
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:00,920
need to... yeah so

4796
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:02,920
on twitch

4797
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:04,920
you can stream in a bikini

4798
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:06,920
if you are in a pool

4799
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:08,920
or a hot tub

4800
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:10,920
so that is like saying I could pop

4801
02:46:10,920 --> 02:46:12,920
up on my bikini toggle right now

4802
02:46:12,920 --> 02:46:14,920
and put like a hot tub asset

4803
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:16,920
and then I am good to go question mark

4804
02:46:16,920 --> 02:46:18,920
like that seems pretty redundant

4805
02:46:18,920 --> 02:46:20,920
em I will close that cause it is kind of

4806
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:22,920
covering up

4807
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:26,920
em

4808
02:46:26,920 --> 02:46:28,920
don't forget that twitch has the hot tub category

4809
02:46:28,920 --> 02:46:30,920
which is only worth watching

4810
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:32,920
when some insane guy in a lab coat

4811
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:34,920
show oh no the fire

4812
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:36,920
we got so distracted

4813
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:38,920
we got so distracted talking about the

4814
02:46:38,920 --> 02:46:40,920
um

4815
02:46:40,920 --> 02:46:42,920
let me take the ashes

4816
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:44,920
so they don't get in the way

4817
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:46,920
I thought ashes got in the way of cooking

4818
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:48,920
am I going crazy did I make that up

4819
02:46:48,920 --> 02:46:50,920
fire

4820
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:52,920
thank you much

4821
02:46:52,920 --> 02:46:54,920
more depreciation

4822
02:46:54,920 --> 02:46:56,920
I completely forgot what I was saying

4823
02:46:56,920 --> 02:46:58,920
in real life youtube is

4824
02:46:58,920 --> 02:47:00,920
barely having a time I feel like they get away with

4825
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:02,920
anything

4826
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:04,920
youtube is definitely more

4827
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:06,920
wait am I dumb

4828
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:08,920
youtube is definitely

4829
02:47:08,920 --> 02:47:10,920
so much nicer than me

4830
02:47:10,920 --> 02:47:12,920
em

4831
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:14,920
it's just the facts bro

4832
02:47:14,920 --> 02:47:16,920
I'm sorry you can argue

4833
02:47:16,920 --> 02:47:18,920
to a wall cause my burn rate

4834
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:20,920
keeps going up

4835
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:22,920
stop

4836
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:24,920
stop burning

4837
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:26,920
you shouldn't be burning

4838
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:28,920
em

4839
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:30,920
I'm here for the long haul

4840
02:47:30,920 --> 02:47:32,920
oh yeah you got endurance for 12 hours

4841
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:34,920
abusing mods

4842
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:36,920
streamer abusing mods

4843
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:38,920
but they like it though

4844
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:42,920
don't you mods

4845
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:44,920
but you can't speak

4846
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:46,920
this is a one sided conversation

4847
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:50,920
em

4848
02:47:50,920 --> 02:47:52,920
I think all the girls got extra mods

4849
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:54,920
by the way so do check your discord

4850
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:56,920
or whatever you applied with

4851
02:47:56,920 --> 02:47:58,920
I have no idea I didn't handle the mods

4852
02:47:58,920 --> 02:48:00,920
so if you got picked as a mod congrats

4853
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:02,920
wasn't it me

4854
02:48:02,920 --> 02:48:04,920
em

4855
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:06,920
but do check cause I think

4856
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:08,920
3 people didn't respond

4857
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:10,920
even though they were super keen

4858
02:48:10,920 --> 02:48:12,920
em

4859
02:48:12,920 --> 02:48:14,920
twitch

4860
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:16,920
admins have their favourite

4861
02:48:16,920 --> 02:48:18,920
mods and shambles

4862
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:20,920
tell me about the dude with the lab coat

4863
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:22,920
in the bikini

4864
02:48:22,920 --> 02:48:24,920
wait is that real

4865
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:26,920
gotta get your hair blow up

4866
02:48:26,920 --> 02:48:28,920
there are potions to help you last

4867
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:30,920
longer

4868
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:32,920
oh my god that's terrible

4869
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:34,920
mods aren't real they're like birds

4870
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:36,920
post what you want

4871
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:38,920
alright I do have mods

4872
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:40,920
we need to keep things above board

4873
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:42,920
ok

4874
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:44,920
another mod flexing on you

4875
02:48:44,920 --> 02:48:46,920
by deleting your message

4876
02:48:46,920 --> 02:48:48,920
lmao

4877
02:48:48,920 --> 02:48:50,920
and slap

4878
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:52,920
I don't know what the lab coat thing is though

4879
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:54,920
twitch feels better

4880
02:48:54,920 --> 02:48:56,920
as a dedicated streaming site

4881
02:48:56,920 --> 02:48:58,920
but the actual infrastructure management is awful

4882
02:48:58,920 --> 02:49:00,920
yeah I would say discoverability

4883
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:02,920
on youtube

4884
02:49:02,920 --> 02:49:04,920
is so much better

4885
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:06,920
in my opinion especially

4886
02:49:06,920 --> 02:49:08,920
with the shorts algorithm

4887
02:49:08,920 --> 02:49:10,920
I would say on twitch the only

4888
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:12,920
way I could

4889
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:14,920
you know foresee

4890
02:49:14,920 --> 02:49:16,920
someone

4891
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:18,920
em

4892
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:20,920
fore fore see

4893
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:24,920
foresee someone being

4894
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:26,920
em

4895
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:28,920
discovered

4896
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:30,920
is the raid option

4897
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:32,920
which is called redirect on youtube

4898
02:49:32,920 --> 02:49:34,920
if you get

4899
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:36,920
a streamer that is kind enough

4900
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:38,920
and is massive and raids into you

4901
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:40,920
it can literally

4902
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:42,920
make or break you as a streamer

4903
02:49:42,920 --> 02:49:44,920
it's pretty insane it really is

4904
02:49:44,920 --> 02:49:46,920
em

4905
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:48,920
I have told the girls please

4906
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:50,920
to always raid into each other

4907
02:49:50,920 --> 02:49:52,920
to keep a train going

4908
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:54,920
if no other talent

4909
02:49:54,920 --> 02:49:56,920
is online then you're more than welcome

4910
02:49:56,920 --> 02:49:58,920
to raid into another agency

4911
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:00,920
no problem at all

4912
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:02,920
like I

4913
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:04,920
yesterday called in a favour

4914
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:06,920
with a friend

4915
02:50:06,920 --> 02:50:08,920
mimosa

4916
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:10,920
was it yesterday?

4917
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:12,920
no it must have been the other day

4918
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:14,920
she was so polite

4919
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:16,920
and I said look I'll raid into you

4920
02:50:16,920 --> 02:50:18,920
but do me a favour when you finish up your stream

4921
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:20,920
raid back into a violour girl

4922
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:22,920
and she said that is more than happy

4923
02:50:22,920 --> 02:50:24,920
with those terms and I was like yeah

4924
02:50:24,920 --> 02:50:26,920
I'm more than happy calling a favour for a friend

4925
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:32,920
yes I

4926
02:50:32,920 --> 02:50:34,920
absolutely don't mind it at all

4927
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:36,920
the v and u girls have been absolutely

4928
02:50:36,920 --> 02:50:38,920
fantastic some of them have been

4929
02:50:38,920 --> 02:50:40,920
raiding into me I actually need to start

4930
02:50:40,920 --> 02:50:42,920
messaging some of them and being like hey you have

4931
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:44,920
3d o microphone question mark question mark

4932
02:50:44,920 --> 02:50:46,920
em

4933
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:48,920
I still find the violour mentality

4934
02:50:48,920 --> 02:50:50,920
of mods please do this thing thank you

4935
02:50:50,920 --> 02:50:52,920
now please be quiet affectionately

4936
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:56,920
yes em

4937
02:50:56,920 --> 02:50:58,920
it's very

4938
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:00,920
I don't want to say jarring

4939
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:02,920
em but for someone

4940
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:04,920
who may be new to stream

4941
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:06,920
and

4942
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:08,920
the streamer

4943
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:10,920
is having a repertoire

4944
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:12,920
but a back and forth with mods

4945
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:14,920
that are named it's a bit not

4946
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:16,920
isolated but it's like

4947
02:51:16,920 --> 02:51:18,920
it feels like you've missed out on lore

4948
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:20,920
and it just gets harder to enjoy the streamer

4949
02:51:20,920 --> 02:51:22,920
like someone could be lurking watching

4950
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:24,920
me for the first time right now

4951
02:51:24,920 --> 02:51:26,920
em and just being like

4952
02:51:26,920 --> 02:51:28,920
was she all about type thing and if I'm like

4953
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:30,920
oh mod x mod this mod y

4954
02:51:30,920 --> 02:51:32,920
mod b mod c and like

4955
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:34,920
cracking like you jokes all the time

4956
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:36,920
em like it's not

4957
02:51:36,920 --> 02:51:38,920
very

4958
02:51:38,920 --> 02:51:40,920
enabling to come in for the first

4959
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:42,920
time

4960
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:44,920
em whereas I quite

4961
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:46,920
like the mods don't speak

4962
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:48,920
but we are incredibly appreciative

4963
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:50,920
for you you know mopping

4964
02:51:50,920 --> 02:51:52,920
mopping the floors

4965
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:54,920
and making sure everything is good to go in

4966
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:56,920
stream yaw

4967
02:51:56,920 --> 02:51:58,920
em

4968
02:51:58,920 --> 02:52:00,920
do shorts still work for discovery

4969
02:52:00,920 --> 02:52:02,920
emory said they

4970
02:52:02,920 --> 02:52:04,920
attached dead people to the channel

4971
02:52:04,920 --> 02:52:06,920
no

4972
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:08,920
emy isn't entirely wrong

4973
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:10,920
but she isn't entirely right

4974
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:12,920
shorts

4975
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:14,920
definitely have a subscription

4976
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:16,920
subscriber count

4977
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:18,920
effect

4978
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:20,920
em and they also have discoverability

4979
02:52:20,920 --> 02:52:22,920
effect

4980
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:24,920
not all shorts people

4981
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:26,920
who will subscribe to you will show up in a

4982
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:28,920
live stream that's just facts

4983
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:30,920
some people purely enjoy shorts

4984
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:32,920
mind rot and they will just

4985
02:52:32,920 --> 02:52:34,920
watch shorts and nothing else that's

4986
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:36,920
perfectly fine so emy is both

4987
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:38,920
right and both a wee bit wrong

4988
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:40,920
it's very good em I do

4989
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:42,920
have

4990
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:44,920
brah I have three

4991
02:52:44,920 --> 02:52:46,920
shorts editors and all three

4992
02:52:46,920 --> 02:52:48,920
of them are busy for a couple of weeks

4993
02:52:48,920 --> 02:52:50,920
and I could absolutely smash their faces

4994
02:52:50,920 --> 02:52:52,920
because I need help I don't have

4995
02:52:52,920 --> 02:52:54,920
editing skills

4996
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:56,920
em I think I'm going to have to reach

4997
02:52:56,920 --> 02:52:58,920
out to an editor that I like

4998
02:52:58,920 --> 02:53:00,920
to style of

4999
02:53:00,920 --> 02:53:02,920
because I'm drowning

5000
02:53:02,920 --> 02:53:04,920
I need help with shorts and I do not

5001
02:53:04,920 --> 02:53:06,920
have the skills for it nor do I

5002
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:08,920
have the time for it but I'm

5003
02:53:08,920 --> 02:53:10,920
now that the girls are monetized I'm wanting

5004
02:53:10,920 --> 02:53:12,920
to

5005
02:53:12,920 --> 02:53:14,920
close through em I'm wanting

5006
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:16,920
to start pushing out shorts for the

5007
02:53:16,920 --> 02:53:18,920
baby girls now em to help

5008
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:20,920
with overall sub count

5009
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:22,920
we are going to put some advertisements

5010
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:24,920
into the shorts as well so

5011
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:26,920
some might have more views and others

5012
02:53:26,920 --> 02:53:28,920
and we'll take it from there

5013
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:30,920

5014
02:53:30,920 --> 02:53:32,920

em

5019
02:53:40,920 --> 02:53:42,920
which

5020
02:53:42,920 --> 02:53:44,920
shouldn't really be

5021
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:46,920
too hard

5022
02:53:46,920 --> 02:53:48,920

02:54:02,920 --> 02:54:04,920
any naughty number approaches me

5031
02:54:04,920 --> 02:54:06,920
em

5032
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:08,920
new viewers feel like they are walking

5033
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:10,920
into a friend group yes

5034
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:12,920
it definitely

5035
02:54:12,920 --> 02:54:14,920
em

5036
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:16,920
especially whenever I

5037
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:18,920
kind of

5038
02:54:18,920 --> 02:54:20,920
talk I like to say

5039
02:54:20,920 --> 02:54:22,920
oh I spoke about this yesterday but

5040
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:24,920
don't worry if you weren't there

5041
02:54:24,920 --> 02:54:26,920
because it's also quite

5042
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:28,920
nice and kind language to use

5043
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:30,920
for people who may genuinely

5044
02:54:30,920 --> 02:54:32,920
who couldn't have been there

5045
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:34,920
em

5046
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:36,920
types of how do I keep

5047
02:54:36,920 --> 02:54:38,920
doing that I don't know how I keep doing that

5048
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:40,920
I'm being such a silly bully with that

5049
02:54:40,920 --> 02:54:42,920
em whoa

5050
02:54:42,920 --> 02:54:44,920
8.4 okay at 8000

5051
02:54:44,920 --> 02:54:46,920
I will call a break

5052
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:48,920
and I'm going to pee get a cup of tea

5053
02:54:48,920 --> 02:54:50,920
get some snacks em

5054
02:54:50,920 --> 02:54:52,920
and hopefully Gimli doesn't

5055
02:54:52,920 --> 02:54:54,920
come flying into the room the moment I open

5056
02:54:54,920 --> 02:54:56,920
the door but I think she may

5057
02:54:56,920 --> 02:54:58,920
em

5058
02:54:58,920 --> 02:55:00,920
if the streamer is only talking to their moz

5059
02:55:00,920 --> 02:55:02,920
that's fault the rest of the chat

5060
02:55:02,920 --> 02:55:04,920
your sub count will be inflated

5061
02:55:04,920 --> 02:55:06,920
but it's still a net positive it's a positive

5062
02:55:06,920 --> 02:55:08,920
overall I

5063
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:10,920
I'm happy to see this publicly I

5064
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:12,920
really want to get play buttons for the girls

5065
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:14,920
I think

5066
02:55:14,920 --> 02:55:16,920
I would absolutely love that

5067
02:55:16,920 --> 02:55:18,920
em

5068
02:55:18,920 --> 02:55:20,920
it'll take time

5069
02:55:20,920 --> 02:55:22,920
it will take hard work it'll take dedication

5070
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:24,920
but em

5071
02:55:24,920 --> 02:55:26,920
I will show the girls what

5072
02:55:26,920 --> 02:55:28,920
is working for me what has worked what is

5073
02:55:28,920 --> 02:55:30,920
working em and

5074
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:32,920
you know

5075
02:55:32,920 --> 02:55:34,920
if they do shorts with me if they do

5076
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:36,920
ASMR collabs with other girls

5077
02:55:36,920 --> 02:55:38,920
em if they do

5078
02:55:38,920 --> 02:55:40,920
zoom collabs with the girls

5079
02:55:40,920 --> 02:55:42,920
em I think it is very

5080
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:44,920
possible I actually

5081
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:46,920
do not see it as an impossibility

5082
02:55:46,920 --> 02:55:48,920
if the girls let me cook and

5083
02:55:48,920 --> 02:55:50,920
equally they also cook

5084
02:55:50,920 --> 02:55:52,920
em I think it would be

5085
02:55:52,920 --> 02:55:54,920
absolutely lovely to get the girls play buttons

5086
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:56,920
and before anyone

5087
02:55:56,920 --> 02:55:58,920
asks is Veeler holding the play buttons

5088
02:55:58,920 --> 02:56:00,920
eh no

5089
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:02,920
why I'll say it again

5090
02:56:02,920 --> 02:56:04,920
I

5091
02:56:04,920 --> 02:56:06,920
would never

5092
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:08,920
ever hold

5093
02:56:08,920 --> 02:56:10,920
a beautiful symbol

5094
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:12,920
of their hard work their dedication

5095
02:56:12,920 --> 02:56:14,920
their love for their craft

5096
02:56:14,920 --> 02:56:16,920
their love for their community

5097
02:56:16,920 --> 02:56:18,920
from the girl

5098
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:20,920
absolutely not pointing fingers

5099
02:56:20,920 --> 02:56:22,920
but

5100
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:24,920
I think it is very clear

5101
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:26,920
there is

5102
02:56:26,920 --> 02:56:28,920
corporate greedy agencies

5103
02:56:28,920 --> 02:56:30,920
that care about accolades

5104
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:32,920
to prevent them

5105
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:34,920
from to prevent their talents

5106
02:56:34,920 --> 02:56:36,920
from holding such a beautiful symbol

5107
02:56:36,920 --> 02:56:38,920
and then there are

5108
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:40,920
agencies like Veeler that says do whatever you want

5109
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:42,920
here's the money

5110
02:56:42,920 --> 02:56:44,920
basically here do

5111
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:46,920
you want have fun here's your money

5112
02:56:46,920 --> 02:56:48,920
here's your play button

5113
02:56:48,920 --> 02:56:50,920
em yes

5114
02:56:50,920 --> 02:56:52,920
you don't want the play button on your

5115
02:56:52,920 --> 02:56:54,920
giant mega yacht no

5116
02:56:54,920 --> 02:56:56,920
I absolutely do not

5117
02:56:56,920 --> 02:56:58,920
care for that

5118
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:00,920
right I have to ask I actually don't know

5119
02:57:00,920 --> 02:57:02,920
if it's real I only hear it from the memes

5120
02:57:02,920 --> 02:57:04,920
is the yacht real is there actually

5121
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:06,920
a yacht or is it or is it just a meme

5122
02:57:08,920 --> 02:57:10,920
hello do you plan on playing

5123
02:57:10,920 --> 02:57:12,920
Titanfall 2 absolutely

5124
02:57:12,920 --> 02:57:14,920
it's a fantastic game

5125
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:16,920
I would love to give it a

5126
02:57:16,920 --> 02:57:18,920
a shot

5127
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:20,920
for the first time as Stronu Cuddles

5128
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:22,920
meh meh meh

5129
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:24,920
and we can see BT

5130
02:57:24,920 --> 02:57:26,920
together and this time

5131
02:57:26,920 --> 02:57:28,920
I will get uppies from the correct BT

5132
02:57:28,920 --> 02:57:30,920
and not an enemy that

5133
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:32,920
freaked me out because I could have sworn

5134
02:57:32,920 --> 02:57:34,920
it was

5135
02:57:34,920 --> 02:57:36,920
nah it's a meme

5136
02:57:36,920 --> 02:57:38,920
okay it's a meme okay I thought it was real

5137
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:40,920
I thought it was actually

5138
02:57:40,920 --> 02:57:42,920
real and someone was like oh my god

5139
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:44,920
this person owns an actual yacht on the

5140
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:46,920
back of these VTubers hard

5141
02:57:46,920 --> 02:57:48,920
work and

5142
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:50,920
I don't know who it is

5143
02:57:50,920 --> 02:57:52,920
you know who you are

5144
02:57:52,920 --> 02:57:54,920
whoever keeps telling me

5145
02:57:54,920 --> 02:57:56,920
to save the blue one

5146
02:57:56,920 --> 02:57:58,920
I can't

5147
02:57:58,920 --> 02:58:00,920
my guy for one

5148
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:02,920
and two LaMalle

5149
02:58:02,920 --> 02:58:04,920
you're starting to

5150
02:58:04,920 --> 02:58:06,920
I'm starting to think you're just daily

5151
02:58:06,920 --> 02:58:08,920
asking that in my Marshmallow

5152
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:10,920
so I keep bringing it up

5153
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:12,920
I cannot save anyone

5154
02:58:12,920 --> 02:58:14,920
I cannot save them all

5155
02:58:14,920 --> 02:58:16,920
but those who seek

5156
02:58:16,920 --> 02:58:18,920
the violor route

5157
02:58:18,920 --> 02:58:20,920
I will do anything and everything

5158
02:58:20,920 --> 02:58:22,920
in my power to help you

5159
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:24,920
achieve your dreams

5160
02:58:24,920 --> 02:58:26,920
and I hope my girls are

5161
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:28,920
ready to test to that

5162
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:30,920
I am happy to

5163
02:58:30,920 --> 02:58:32,920
discuss that I always root

5164
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:34,920
for the underdog

5165
02:58:34,920 --> 02:58:36,920
and I think

5166
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:38,920
you should too always root for the underdog

5167
02:58:38,920 --> 02:58:40,920
sheebie

5168
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:42,920

5230
03:00:48,920 --> 03:00:50,920

5237
03:01:02,920 --> 03:01:04,920

5240
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:10,920
algorithm and pushing violaer to you

5241
03:01:10,920 --> 03:01:12,920

andy and lele she's doing the correct thing

5249
03:01:26,920 --> 03:01:28,920
and she's also holding in her urea

5250
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:30,920
for her chats

5251
03:01:30,920 --> 03:01:32,920

Brian

5258
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:46,920
okay thank you for the tip

5259
03:01:46,920 --> 03:01:48,920
Brian but there is no

5260
03:01:48,920 --> 03:01:50,920
message so Brian didn't talk

5261
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:52,920
really interesting and good to know

5262
03:01:52,920 --> 03:01:54,920
yes Amy is doing the correct ending

5263
03:01:54,920 --> 03:01:56,920
to Andy and Lele so if you are

5264
03:01:56,920 --> 03:01:58,920
looking for a bit more of engaging

5265
03:01:58,920 --> 03:02:00,920
engaging gameplay

5266
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:02,920
then rip for Brian

5267
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:06,920
I'm just here to burn swordfish

5268
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:08,920
to be honest yeah honestly I'm here to burn them too

5269
03:02:08,920 --> 03:02:10,920
18.1% the burn rate is going up

5270
03:02:10,920 --> 03:02:12,920
I'm not

5271
03:02:12,920 --> 03:02:14,920
beating the burn rate allegations

5272
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:16,920
they're not doing too well at all

5273
03:02:16,920 --> 03:02:18,920
but thank you for the tip Brian

5274
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:24,920
less robotic please

5275
03:02:24,920 --> 03:02:26,920
that is how I type

5276
03:02:26,920 --> 03:02:28,920
it's the only way I can get words out

5277
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:30,920
and stuff it's terrible

5278
03:02:30,920 --> 03:02:32,920
I have like really

5279
03:02:32,920 --> 03:02:34,920
poor

5280
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:38,920
I have really

5281
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:40,920
poor I don't mind

5282
03:02:40,920 --> 03:02:42,920
talking about it I always talk about it

5283
03:02:42,920 --> 03:02:44,920
I have problems reading and writing

5284
03:02:44,920 --> 03:02:46,920
which I don't you guys

5285
03:02:46,920 --> 03:02:48,920
are more than welcome to poke fun at my grammar

5286
03:02:48,920 --> 03:02:50,920
my English my spelling it does

5287
03:02:50,920 --> 03:02:52,920
not bother me at all because

5288
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:54,920
I get to be like a smug little

5289
03:02:54,920 --> 03:02:56,920
about it and be like oh yeah

5290
03:02:56,920 --> 03:02:58,920
I've got problems reading and writing and yet my

5291
03:02:58,920 --> 03:03:00,920
entire job surrounds reading and writing isn't

5292
03:03:00,920 --> 03:03:02,920
that hilarious and I get to be smug about

5293
03:03:02,920 --> 03:03:04,920
it because it's like oh well

5294
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:06,920
it worked out so far even though I can't

5295
03:03:06,920 --> 03:03:08,920
do it properly

5296
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:10,920
but I

5297
03:03:10,920 --> 03:03:12,920
please don't ever be like oh I'm scared to

5298
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:14,920
poke a little fun at me or whatever

5299
03:03:14,920 --> 03:03:16,920
you're more than welcome to it doesn't

5300
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:18,920
it doesn't

5301
03:03:18,920 --> 03:03:20,920
what if I search Azura

5302
03:03:20,920 --> 03:03:22,920
what if I search Azura doesn't appear

5303
03:03:22,920 --> 03:03:24,920
her channel though no you have to type

5304
03:03:24,920 --> 03:03:26,920
her full name we've only been out

5305
03:03:26,920 --> 03:03:28,920
for a week the algorithm isn't going to know you're

5306
03:03:28,920 --> 03:03:30,920
asking for Azura delay the VTuber

5307
03:03:30,920 --> 03:03:32,920
you have to type Azura as a

5308
03:03:32,920 --> 03:03:34,920
ure a space de ure

5309
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:36,920
de a e te there you go Azura delay

5310
03:03:36,920 --> 03:03:38,920
I know it has a T

5311
03:03:38,920 --> 03:03:40,920
in it unfortunately it is French so

5312
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:42,920
you drop the T wow wait wait wait

5313
03:03:42,920 --> 03:03:44,920
whoa whoa whoa whoa

5314
03:03:44,920 --> 03:03:46,920
French and Scottish people drop in the T

5315
03:03:46,920 --> 03:03:48,920
in their pronunciations what's going on here

5316
03:03:48,920 --> 03:03:50,920
no

5317
03:03:50,920 --> 03:03:52,920
I simply type the surname with the double

5318
03:03:52,920 --> 03:03:54,920
L that's the problem

5319
03:03:54,920 --> 03:03:56,920
Katoos you gotta

5320
03:03:56,920 --> 03:03:58,920
give them the government name oh

5321
03:03:58,920 --> 03:04:00,920
silly how silly how could you forget

5322
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:02,920
scrolling

5323
03:04:02,920 --> 03:04:04,920
Pinterest

5324
03:04:04,920 --> 03:04:06,920
and it's just AI generated pics

5325
03:04:06,920 --> 03:04:08,920
of koalas with big

5326
03:04:08,920 --> 03:04:10,920
what wait what

5327
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:12,920
did you type in one of our

5328
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:14,920
VTuber names and then came up with that

5329
03:04:14,920 --> 03:04:16,920
by the way strongy since I never

5330
03:04:16,920 --> 03:04:18,920
played Rinscape could you sell me on it

5331
03:04:18,920 --> 03:04:20,920
number go up

5332
03:04:20,920 --> 03:04:22,920
yippee

5333
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:24,920
it is a slow incremental

5334
03:04:24,920 --> 03:04:26,920
game although it well depends

5335
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:28,920
on how you want to play it I

5336
03:04:28,920 --> 03:04:30,920
am literally just cooking

5337
03:04:30,920 --> 03:04:32,920
I'm cooking away look see this little

5338
03:04:32,920 --> 03:04:34,920
progress bar cooking

5339
03:04:34,920 --> 03:04:36,920
I'm currently level 65

5340
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:38,920
and cooking and

5341
03:04:38,920 --> 03:04:40,920
I

5342
03:04:40,920 --> 03:04:42,920
I'm watching

5343
03:04:42,920 --> 03:04:44,920
the bar slowly go up

5344
03:04:44,920 --> 03:04:46,920
and it's beautiful

5345
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:48,920
and I get dopamine

5346
03:04:48,920 --> 03:04:50,920
every time I says I level up in the game

5347
03:04:50,920 --> 03:04:52,920
it's gorgeous I just can't help it

5348
03:04:54,920 --> 03:04:56,920
I'mma be real I'm not even here for the

5349
03:04:56,920 --> 03:04:58,920
gameplay I'm here for rambling while I play Isaac

5350
03:04:58,920 --> 03:05:00,920
I thought about doing Eden Isaac

5351
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:02,920
runs shortly

5352
03:05:02,920 --> 03:05:04,920
for like a shorter stream idea

5353
03:05:04,920 --> 03:05:06,920
if you didn't know the most

5354
03:05:06,920 --> 03:05:08,920
Isaac runs last one hour

5355
03:05:08,920 --> 03:05:10,920
so I thought maybe for a shorter stream

5356
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:12,920
I would purposely do a four hour

5357
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:14,920
stream so I can redirect into Emmy

5358
03:05:14,920 --> 03:05:16,920
because I never redirect

5359
03:05:16,920 --> 03:05:18,920
into Emmy I finally got to redirect

5360
03:05:18,920 --> 03:05:20,920
into Azura yesterday

5361
03:05:20,920 --> 03:05:22,920
and but I never do it

5362
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:24,920
for Emmy and I can never do it

5363
03:05:24,920 --> 03:05:26,920
for Icy unless I pulled an all

5364
03:05:26,920 --> 03:05:28,920
nighter I might pull an all nighter

5365
03:05:28,920 --> 03:05:30,920
so I can say I redirected into

5366
03:05:30,920 --> 03:05:32,920
Icy just to be a smug little about it

5367
03:05:34,920 --> 03:05:36,920
but I wanted to do

5368
03:05:36,920 --> 03:05:38,920
a four hour stream so I can redirect into Emmy

5369
03:05:38,920 --> 03:05:40,920
at one point because poor Emmy never gets

5370
03:05:40,920 --> 03:05:42,920
redirected in my reeflings

5371
03:05:42,920 --> 03:05:44,920
are never exposed to Emmy

5372
03:05:44,920 --> 03:05:46,920
and what sentence

5373
03:05:46,920 --> 03:05:48,920
I didn't even mean that sometimes I mean it

5374
03:05:48,920 --> 03:05:50,920
when I say sentences and sometimes the

5375
03:05:50,920 --> 03:05:52,920
sentences just have happened

5376
03:05:52,920 --> 03:05:54,920
I thought dropping T was an American tip

5377
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:56,920
not the harbor

5378
03:05:56,920 --> 03:05:58,920
don't remind me of all

5379
03:05:58,920 --> 03:06:00,920
that beautiful tea

5380
03:06:02,920 --> 03:06:04,920
this is a preparation but she cooking

5381
03:06:04,920 --> 03:06:06,920
for real for me

5382
03:06:06,920 --> 03:06:08,920
everybody feeding the fire to keep up

5383
03:06:08,920 --> 03:06:10,920
yes special thank you to the reeflings

5384
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:12,920
that are just helping stock a fire

5385
03:06:12,920 --> 03:06:14,920
this is making this go

5386
03:06:14,920 --> 03:06:16,920
so fast like so so fast

5387
03:06:16,920 --> 03:06:18,920
so thank you for all your help

5388
03:06:18,920 --> 03:06:20,920
I do appreciate it greatly

5389
03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:22,920
ummm

5390
03:06:22,920 --> 03:06:24,920
but yes

5391
03:06:24,920 --> 03:06:26,920

03:06:34,920 --> 03:06:36,920
back to back to back to back to back to

5397
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:38,920
12 hour endurance

5398
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:40,920
I've not done that

5399
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:42,920
oh no I would have to do all my

5400
03:06:42,920 --> 03:06:44,920
membership streams in one go

5401
03:06:44,920 --> 03:06:46,920
unless I make a deal

5402
03:06:46,920 --> 03:06:48,920
with membership people

5403
03:06:48,920 --> 03:06:50,920
hello scrawny

5404
03:06:50,920 --> 03:06:52,920
first time chatting just came here from

5405
03:06:52,920 --> 03:06:54,920
shebeestream hi harem

5406
03:06:54,920 --> 03:06:56,920
she wasn't holding up

5407
03:06:56,920 --> 03:06:58,920
no she has a migraine

5408
03:06:58,920 --> 03:07:00,920
I honestly I don't know

5409
03:07:00,920 --> 03:07:02,920
what reason she has a migraine for

5410
03:07:02,920 --> 03:07:04,920
because I'm pretty sure migraines have no

5411
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:06,920
rhyme or reason but I'm like 99%

5412
03:07:06,920 --> 03:07:08,920
sure she was crying

5413
03:07:08,920 --> 03:07:10,920
happy tears might have affected it and she

5414
03:07:10,920 --> 03:07:12,920
maybe is pretty dehydrated right now

5415
03:07:12,920 --> 03:07:14,920
ummm

5416
03:07:14,920 --> 03:07:16,920

5423
03:07:28,920 --> 03:07:30,920

the emotes artist is taking their

5431
03:07:44,920 --> 03:07:46,920

to pick their emotes now I'm not going to ruin

5437
03:07:56,920 --> 03:07:58,920
any of them because it's not my business anymore

5438
03:07:58,920 --> 03:08:00,920
to ruin or spoil the behind the scenes

5439
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:02,920
ummm

5440
03:08:02,920 --> 03:08:04,920

5445
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:14,920

5446
03:08:14,920 --> 03:08:16,920
enable it from chat

5447
03:08:16,920 --> 03:08:18,920

5458
03:08:38,920 --> 03:08:40,920
I've had an amazing time

5459
03:08:40,920 --> 03:08:42,920
the girls get to hold the rates to their IPs

5460
03:08:42,920 --> 03:08:44,920
and let them just have

5461
03:08:44,920 --> 03:08:46,920
100% of the money I don't care I'm dead

5462
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:48,920
at that point so ow that

5463
03:08:48,920 --> 03:08:50,920
freaking hurts I don't know what I did to my leg

5464
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:54,920

5465
03:08:54,920 --> 03:08:56,920

5466
03:08:56,920 --> 03:08:58,920

5467
03:08:58,920 --> 03:09:00,920

5468
03:09:00,920 --> 03:09:02,920
give her the veal

5469
03:09:02,920 --> 03:09:04,920
account while you're at it as well why not

5470
03:09:04,920 --> 03:09:06,920
don't say such a thing

5471
03:09:06,920 --> 03:09:08,920
bruv I don't know why my leg is sore all of a sudden

5472
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:10,920
I doubt I pulled a muscle sitting

5473
03:09:10,920 --> 03:09:12,920
on my leg the way I usually do

5474
03:09:12,920 --> 03:09:14,920
I don't normally do any of that

5475
03:09:14,920 --> 03:09:16,920
I love you too

5476
03:09:16,920 --> 03:09:18,920
no I'm not allowed to die yet

5477
03:09:18,920 --> 03:09:20,920
you know if death ever comes

5478
03:09:20,920 --> 03:09:22,920
for me I have to say hey death look

5479
03:09:22,920 --> 03:09:24,920
now's not the time the reeflings need me

5480
03:09:24,920 --> 03:09:26,920
and then he'll go aww you're right

5481
03:09:26,920 --> 03:09:28,920
you're right and then death has to

5482
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:30,920
back off okay

5483
03:09:30,920 --> 03:09:32,920
maybe clapping with no hands

5484
03:09:32,920 --> 03:09:34,920
contributed to it

5485
03:09:34,920 --> 03:09:36,920
no I actually did that about

5486
03:09:36,920 --> 03:09:38,920
a week ago

5487
03:09:38,920 --> 03:09:40,920
I think

5488
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:42,920
about a week ago

5489
03:09:44,920 --> 03:09:46,920

5495
03:09:58,920 --> 03:10:00,920
that's creepy not the other way around

5496
03:10:00,920 --> 03:10:02,920
put it on the table right now

5497
03:10:02,920 --> 03:10:04,920
pooch

5498
03:10:04,920 --> 03:10:06,920
scrawny I can't die I'm too busy

5499
03:10:06,920 --> 03:10:08,920
literally I am too busy

5500
03:10:08,920 --> 03:10:10,920
to die I'm not even being funny

5501
03:10:10,920 --> 03:10:12,920
have you ever heard those stories where

5502
03:10:12,920 --> 03:10:14,920
people are like in a coma and they're like

5503
03:10:14,920 --> 03:10:16,920
close to passing away but then they go

5504
03:10:16,920 --> 03:10:18,920
like I'm sorry I can't die right now

5505
03:10:18,920 --> 03:10:20,920
like my family member is going to be

5506
03:10:20,920 --> 03:10:22,920
pfft or like oh

5507
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:24,920
I'm too busy to die right now and then

5508
03:10:24,920 --> 03:10:26,920
they wake up from the coma

5509
03:10:26,920 --> 03:10:28,920
have you ever heard those stories they're pretty

5510
03:10:28,920 --> 03:10:30,920
crazy you can't do

5511
03:10:30,920 --> 03:10:32,920
that I was caught by surprise away

5512
03:10:32,920 --> 03:10:34,920
I worked

5513
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:36,920
we will kill

5514
03:10:36,920 --> 03:10:38,920
death to keep you safe scrawny thank you

5515
03:10:38,920 --> 03:10:40,920
I appreciate it

5516
03:10:42,920 --> 03:10:44,920
no I am far too busy I'm

5517
03:10:44,920 --> 03:10:46,920
I'm not going to say too much

5518
03:10:46,920 --> 03:10:48,920
because I want to respect my

5519
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:50,920
my girls my gen ones I've obviously

5520
03:10:50,920 --> 03:10:52,920
doing a lot cooking actually that remains

5521
03:10:52,920 --> 03:10:54,920
many to go ask for a collaboration from another

5522
03:10:54,920 --> 03:10:56,920
VTuber and I have no idea if they're going to accept

5523
03:10:56,920 --> 03:10:58,920
they might accept they might not

5524
03:10:58,920 --> 03:11:00,920
hey ho we'll try

5525
03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:04,920
currently gen 2 is cooking

5526
03:11:04,920 --> 03:11:06,920
and yeah no I'm not naming

5527
03:11:06,920 --> 03:11:08,920
them you'll be happy to know

5528
03:11:08,920 --> 03:11:10,920
I'm not naming them

5529
03:11:10,920 --> 03:11:12,920
but it's very

5530
03:11:12,920 --> 03:11:14,920
busy trying to maintain everything

5531
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:16,920
all at once

5532
03:11:18,920 --> 03:11:20,920
but I did say I'm a workaholic

5533
03:11:20,920 --> 03:11:22,920
and I really

5534
03:11:22,920 --> 03:11:24,920
enjoy working I

5535
03:11:24,920 --> 03:11:26,920
enjoy giving value for money as well

5536
03:11:26,920 --> 03:11:28,920
especially in this day and age

5537
03:11:28,920 --> 03:11:30,920
where everything's getting

5538
03:11:30,920 --> 03:11:32,920
greedier and greedier I'm like no

5539
03:11:32,920 --> 03:11:34,920
we're going to do a business tactic

5540
03:11:34,920 --> 03:11:36,920
called undercut in the market

5541
03:11:36,920 --> 03:11:38,920
yay

5542
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:40,920
undercut undercut

5543
03:11:40,920 --> 03:11:42,920
that kind of thing

5544
03:11:42,920 --> 03:11:44,920
damn the hey ho gets moved

5545
03:11:44,920 --> 03:11:46,920
hey ho let me finish

5546
03:11:46,920 --> 03:11:48,920
my point now

5547
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:50,920
I really like pushing myself

5548
03:11:50,920 --> 03:11:52,920
to offer value for money

5549
03:11:52,920 --> 03:11:54,920
it's why even with membership

5550
03:11:54,920 --> 03:11:56,920
streams like on days where we do a membership stream

5551
03:11:56,920 --> 03:11:58,920
I'm still going to do a cheeky 2 over stream

5552
03:11:58,920 --> 03:12:00,920
for it

5553
03:12:00,920 --> 03:12:02,920
and then we can enjoy our

5554
03:12:02,920 --> 03:12:04,920
more cuddly membership streams

5555
03:12:04,920 --> 03:12:06,920
I have absolutely no issue with that

5556
03:12:06,920 --> 03:12:08,920
it doesn't bother me none

5557
03:12:08,920 --> 03:12:10,920
and life is good

5558
03:12:10,920 --> 03:12:12,920
we are bingchining

5559
03:12:12,920 --> 03:12:14,920
bingchining

5560
03:12:14,920 --> 03:12:16,920
undercut in the market

5561
03:12:16,920 --> 03:12:18,920
love

5562
03:12:18,920 --> 03:12:20,920
as I said a bit earlier

5563
03:12:20,920 --> 03:12:22,920
but for the harem

5564
03:12:22,920 --> 03:12:24,920
that might not have been here when I was rambling about it

5565
03:12:24,920 --> 03:12:26,920
I was saying that even if you

5566
03:12:26,920 --> 03:12:28,920
cannot physically give any money

5567
03:12:28,920 --> 03:12:30,920
to the creator you're watching

5568
03:12:30,920 --> 03:12:32,920
just liking the stream

5569
03:12:32,920 --> 03:12:34,920
or subscribing to them

5570
03:12:34,920 --> 03:12:36,920
or just hanging out and lurking

5571
03:12:36,920 --> 03:12:38,920
all of this contributes

5572
03:12:38,920 --> 03:12:40,920
to the algorithm and leads for the girls

5573
03:12:40,920 --> 03:12:42,920
to more success

5574
03:12:42,920 --> 03:12:44,920
especially vaude watchers

5575
03:12:44,920 --> 03:12:46,920
special shout out to vaude watchers

5576
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:50,920
especially if the girl streams

5577
03:12:50,920 --> 03:12:52,920
in a not good time zone for you

5578
03:12:52,920 --> 03:12:54,920
if you go into

5579
03:12:54,920 --> 03:12:56,920
mersey's comment section

5580
03:12:56,920 --> 03:12:58,920
there's like one dedicated vaude watcher

5581
03:12:58,920 --> 03:13:00,920
and I'm like you are helping her out so much

5582
03:13:00,920 --> 03:13:02,920
I understand

5583
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:04,920
watching live stream vaudes

5584
03:13:04,920 --> 03:13:06,920
is not the funnest thing

5585
03:13:06,920 --> 03:13:08,920
because the person isn't live

5586
03:13:08,920 --> 03:13:10,920
but a lot of you are saying

5587
03:13:10,920 --> 03:13:12,920
you kind of listen to me ramble in the background

5588
03:13:12,920 --> 03:13:14,920
that is perfect

5589
03:13:14,920 --> 03:13:16,920
because you engage

5590
03:13:16,920 --> 03:13:18,920
with the content for long periods of time

5591
03:13:18,920 --> 03:13:20,920
again boosting the algorithm

5592
03:13:20,920 --> 03:13:22,920
for the girl

5593
03:13:22,920 --> 03:13:24,920
having cross promotion

5594
03:13:24,920 --> 03:13:26,920
with the vealer girls

5595
03:13:26,920 --> 03:13:28,920
it's just fantastic

5596
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:30,920
it really is

5597
03:13:30,920 --> 03:13:32,920
12 hours of content for free that is value

5598
03:13:32,920 --> 03:13:34,920
yes like I don't mind it

5599
03:13:34,920 --> 03:13:36,920
now it's absolutely

5600
03:13:36,920 --> 03:13:38,920
it's not I'm very serious when I say this

5601
03:13:38,920 --> 03:13:40,920
this is absolutely not a reflection

5602
03:13:40,920 --> 03:13:42,920
on any other

5603
03:13:42,920 --> 03:13:44,920
VTuber streamer whoever whatever

5604
03:13:44,920 --> 03:13:46,920
I

5605
03:13:46,920 --> 03:13:48,920
do not find

5606
03:13:48,920 --> 03:13:50,920
this to be a job

5607
03:13:50,920 --> 03:13:52,920
okay this is

5608
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:54,920
fun I'm enjoying myself

5609
03:13:54,920 --> 03:13:56,920
I am breaking my voice

5610
03:13:56,920 --> 03:13:58,920
rambling to you talking about

5611
03:13:58,920 --> 03:14:00,920
all these plans I've got cooking

5612
03:14:00,920 --> 03:14:02,920
talking about how things are

5613
03:14:02,920 --> 03:14:04,920
like this doesn't feel a job

5614
03:14:04,920 --> 03:14:06,920
feel like a job and I feel

5615
03:14:06,920 --> 03:14:08,920
sorry for streamers

5616
03:14:08,920 --> 03:14:10,920
where it does feel like a job

5617
03:14:10,920 --> 03:14:12,920
and they can't publicly come out

5618
03:14:12,920 --> 03:14:14,920
and be like that

5619
03:14:14,920 --> 03:14:16,920
wow 66

5620
03:14:18,920 --> 03:14:20,920
maybe that should be my

5621
03:14:20,920 --> 03:14:22,920
donation

5622
03:14:22,920 --> 03:14:24,920
like a tip sound instead of

5623
03:14:24,920 --> 03:14:26,920
are you squiddin me right now although actually

5624
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:28,920
I quite like are you squiddin me right now

5625
03:14:28,920 --> 03:14:30,920
no thanks

5626
03:14:30,920 --> 03:14:32,920
to the time stampers

5627
03:14:32,920 --> 03:14:34,920
oh yes special thank you to time stampers as well

5628
03:14:34,920 --> 03:14:36,920
VOD watchers

5629
03:14:36,920 --> 03:14:38,920
for any of the girls this applies

5630
03:14:38,920 --> 03:14:40,920
to any of the girls seriously

5631
03:14:40,920 --> 03:14:42,920
you

5632
03:14:42,920 --> 03:14:44,920
do not go unnoticed especially

5633
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:46,920
on ASMR stream

5634
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:48,920
time stamping on

5635
03:14:48,920 --> 03:14:50,920
ASMR streams is very good for

5636
03:14:50,920 --> 03:14:52,920
me

5637
03:14:52,920 --> 03:14:54,920
because I do have plans to

5638
03:14:54,920 --> 03:14:56,920
clip the girls ASMR

5639
03:14:56,920 --> 03:14:58,920
I'm currently

5640
03:14:58,920 --> 03:15:00,920
in talks with someone to do it for me

5641
03:15:00,920 --> 03:15:02,920
but the problem

5642
03:15:02,920 --> 03:15:04,920
is you know the profits

5643
03:15:04,920 --> 03:15:06,920
aren't the profits won't be there

5644
03:15:06,920 --> 03:15:08,920
for the clipping ASMR thing but

5645
03:15:08,920 --> 03:15:10,920
you know what we'll get there

5646
03:15:10,920 --> 03:15:12,920
all of the

5647
03:15:12,920 --> 03:15:14,920
violour girls are perfect for background

5648
03:15:14,920 --> 03:15:16,920
noise you all have very beautiful voices

5649
03:15:16,920 --> 03:15:18,920
oh thank you

5650
03:15:18,920 --> 03:15:20,920
I'm sure all of us appreciate such a kind

5651
03:15:20,920 --> 03:15:22,920
comment like I love her mixer voices

5652
03:15:22,920 --> 03:15:24,920
accents all of that

5653
03:15:24,920 --> 03:15:26,920
17

5654
03:15:26,920 --> 03:15:28,920
1700

5655
03:15:28,920 --> 03:15:30,920
to go wait what's

5656
03:15:30,920 --> 03:15:32,920
1700 to go the fish

5657
03:15:32,920 --> 03:15:34,920
oh no

5658
03:15:34,920 --> 03:15:36,920
wait what's 1700 to go

5659
03:15:36,920 --> 03:15:38,920
clipping ASMR

5660
03:15:38,920 --> 03:15:40,920
ASMR is a good idea yes ASMR

5661
03:15:40,920 --> 03:15:42,920
is a very popular category

5662
03:15:42,920 --> 03:15:44,920
so

5663
03:15:44,920 --> 03:15:46,920
did Emmy get the right route

5664
03:15:46,920 --> 03:15:48,920
pin pals and Emmy

5665
03:15:48,920 --> 03:15:50,920

5792
03:20:12,920 --> 03:20:14,920
we can't be

03:20:14,920 --> 03:20:16,920

we flings you're allowed

5810
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:50,920
to go take a drink if you like

5811
03:20:52,920 --> 03:20:54,920
right let's use it on the fire

5812
03:20:54,920 --> 03:20:56,920
did you

5813
03:20:56,920 --> 03:20:58,920
select the funny all bell

5814
03:20:58,920 --> 03:21:00,920
on the sub button exactly

5815
03:21:00,920 --> 03:21:02,920
i don't see azura's stream

5816
03:21:02,920 --> 03:21:04,920
i didn't display for me either

5817
03:21:04,920 --> 03:21:06,920
i only displayed mercies there

5818
03:21:06,920 --> 03:21:08,920
i

5819
03:21:08,920 --> 03:21:10,920
i am under the impression

5820
03:21:10,920 --> 03:21:12,920
that we are going to

5821
03:21:12,920 --> 03:21:14,920
be added to holodex

5822
03:21:14,920 --> 03:21:16,920
soon which is a website

5823
03:21:16,920 --> 03:21:18,920
which will

5824
03:21:18,920 --> 03:21:20,920
list all of our streams

5825
03:21:20,920 --> 03:21:22,920
and automatically do it to your time

5826
03:21:22,920 --> 03:21:24,920
zone

5827
03:21:24,920 --> 03:21:26,920
so

5828
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:30,920
that will be coming soon

5829
03:21:30,920 --> 03:21:32,920
if i'm not mistaken

5830
03:21:36,920 --> 03:21:38,920
i don't know how it works

5831
03:21:38,920 --> 03:21:40,920
but it means that it will auto show you

5832
03:21:40,920 --> 03:21:42,920
everyone's stream

5833
03:21:42,920 --> 03:21:44,920
violor we did consider running our own

5834
03:21:44,920 --> 03:21:46,920
website but

5835
03:21:46,920 --> 03:21:48,920
it was like another expense

5836
03:21:48,920 --> 03:21:50,920
that you know what holodex does it

5837
03:21:50,920 --> 03:21:52,920
for free and i'd rather

5838
03:21:52,920 --> 03:21:54,920
put any expenses like back into the girls

5839
03:21:54,920 --> 03:21:56,920
back into shorts back into promotion

5840
03:21:58,920 --> 03:22:00,920
there is for those

5841
03:22:00,920 --> 03:22:02,920
pin pals that are listening in

5842
03:22:02,920 --> 03:22:04,920
and any snowberries

5843
03:22:04,920 --> 03:22:06,920
there may or may not be an asmr

5844
03:22:06,920 --> 03:22:08,920
coming

5845
03:22:08,920 --> 03:22:10,920
for snowberries and pin pals

5846
03:22:10,920 --> 03:22:12,920
i hope you enjoy it

5847
03:22:12,920 --> 03:22:14,920
when it does come out

5848
03:22:14,920 --> 03:22:16,920
but there's a little hint for you

5849
03:22:16,920 --> 03:22:18,920
yes

5850
03:22:18,920 --> 03:22:20,920
holodex takes an average of

5851
03:22:20,920 --> 03:22:22,920
20k on all channels

5852
03:22:22,920 --> 03:22:24,920
as prerequisite

5853
03:22:24,920 --> 03:22:26,920
ok well we're coming for it

5854
03:22:26,920 --> 03:22:28,920
for any

5855
03:22:28,920 --> 03:22:30,920
yappening

5856
03:22:30,920 --> 03:22:32,920
that you may have missed out on because you are watching

5857
03:22:32,920 --> 03:22:34,920
the good ending

5858
03:22:34,920 --> 03:22:36,920
on emmy

5859
03:22:36,920 --> 03:22:38,920
stream

5860
03:22:38,920 --> 03:22:40,920
long story

5861
03:22:40,920 --> 03:22:42,920
short

5862
03:22:42,920 --> 03:22:44,920
azura

5863
03:22:44,920 --> 03:22:46,920
is the last one that we

5864
03:22:46,920 --> 03:22:48,920
are waiting for monetization on

5865
03:22:48,920 --> 03:22:50,920
and all of the girls have been

5866
03:22:50,920 --> 03:22:52,920
successfully

5867
03:22:52,920 --> 03:22:54,920
monetized i really started

5868
03:22:54,920 --> 03:22:56,920
through that one

5869
03:22:56,920 --> 03:22:58,920
and the monetization streams will be

5870
03:22:58,920 --> 03:23:00,920
happening soon tm

5871
03:23:00,920 --> 03:23:02,920
you can become a member as a reefling

5872
03:23:02,920 --> 03:23:04,920
you can become a member as a snippet

5873
03:23:04,920 --> 03:23:06,920
and tomorrow

5874
03:23:06,920 --> 03:23:08,920
snowberries and pin pals

5875
03:23:08,920 --> 03:23:10,920
you can also

5876
03:23:10,920 --> 03:23:12,920
become a member

5877
03:23:12,920 --> 03:23:14,920
because the girls are doing their membership

5878
03:23:14,920 --> 03:23:16,920
celebration

5879
03:23:16,920 --> 03:23:18,920
so please do not worry though

5880
03:23:18,920 --> 03:23:20,920
the girls will always be streaming for free

5881
03:23:20,920 --> 03:23:22,920
as well they will not be

5882
03:23:22,920 --> 03:23:24,920
exclusively doing membership streams

5883
03:23:24,920 --> 03:23:26,920
that's not how it works around these parts

5884
03:23:26,920 --> 03:23:28,920
but please do look out for it

5885
03:23:28,920 --> 03:23:30,920
because once my

5886
03:23:30,920 --> 03:23:32,920
endurance stream ends

5887
03:23:32,920 --> 03:23:34,920
for 12 hours i'm doing a cheeky endurance stream

5888
03:23:34,920 --> 03:23:36,920
once my stream ends

5889
03:23:36,920 --> 03:23:38,920
i am going to be the one pulling the strings

5890
03:23:38,920 --> 03:23:40,920
behind the scenes and opening up membership

5891
03:23:40,920 --> 03:23:42,920
so if you really wanted to get it

5892
03:23:42,920 --> 03:23:44,920
before the stream you can

5893
03:23:44,920 --> 03:23:46,920
but it's better to do it on stream

5894
03:23:46,920 --> 03:23:48,920
because the girls will say your name

5895
03:23:50,920 --> 03:23:52,920
do you want to hear the girls say your name

5896
03:23:52,920 --> 03:23:54,920
don't be silly

5897
03:23:54,920 --> 03:23:56,920
let the girls say your name

5898
03:23:58,920 --> 03:24:00,920
my wallet isn't paying waiting for membership

5899
03:24:00,920 --> 03:24:02,920
you can become a vill

5900
03:24:02,920 --> 03:24:04,920
oh okay

5901
03:24:04,920 --> 03:24:06,920
this isn't emmy in game before anyone

5902
03:24:06,920 --> 03:24:08,920
thinks it's actually emmy

5903
03:24:08,920 --> 03:24:10,920
that's hilarious though

5904
03:24:10,920 --> 03:24:12,920
we've got a pin pal

5905
03:24:12,920 --> 03:24:14,920
and they're waiting on emmy

5906
03:24:14,920 --> 03:24:16,920
singing

5907
03:24:16,920 --> 03:24:18,920
say mommy would you like us

5908
03:24:18,920 --> 03:24:20,920
to send you emmy's latest deleted audio

5909
03:24:20,920 --> 03:24:22,920

5912
03:24:30,920 --> 03:24:32,920
what did she do

5913
03:24:32,920 --> 03:24:34,920
what did she do

5914
03:24:34,920 --> 03:24:36,920
what did i miss

5915
03:24:36,920 --> 03:24:38,920
peeler

5916
03:24:38,920 --> 03:24:40,920
did she just

5917
03:24:40,920 --> 03:24:42,920
did she just end stream

5918
03:24:42,920 --> 03:24:44,920
and then give you the audio

5919
03:24:44,920 --> 03:24:46,920
of the

5920
03:24:46,920 --> 03:24:48,920
bra

5921
03:24:48,920 --> 03:24:50,920

i knew it i knew she was doing it

5927
03:25:12,920 --> 03:25:14,920
she may or may not have been forced to

5928
03:25:14,920 --> 03:25:16,920
i'm like

5929
03:25:16,920 --> 03:25:18,920
i need to join in too but i feel like

5930
03:25:18,920 --> 03:25:20,920
my peeler

5931
03:25:20,920 --> 03:25:22,920
isn't going to be very fun because i

5932
03:25:22,920 --> 03:25:24,920
hardly have any liquids

5933
03:25:24,920 --> 03:25:26,920
i swear it from my hands and feet so much

5934
03:25:26,920 --> 03:25:28,920
oh i need to clip that

5935
03:25:28,920 --> 03:25:30,920
actually i need to clip that

5936
03:25:30,920 --> 03:25:32,920
fucking part of stream where the pop rocks

5937
03:25:32,920 --> 03:25:34,920
popped to prove how sweaty my feet are

5938
03:25:36,920 --> 03:25:38,920
i'm probably going to have to make that clip

5939
03:25:38,920 --> 03:25:40,920
myself actually now that i think about it

5940
03:25:40,920 --> 03:25:42,920

5941
03:25:42,920 --> 03:25:44,920

12 hours i have 12

6077
03:30:16,920 --> 03:30:18,920
hours to remember to say one

6078
03:30:18,920 --> 03:30:20,920
sentence and i fail the

6079
03:30:20,920 --> 03:30:22,920
challenge every single time you guys are

6080
03:30:22,920 --> 03:30:24,920
just gonna have to do it in the chat for me

6081
03:30:24,920 --> 03:30:26,920
it's kinda ridiculous um

6082
03:30:26,920 --> 03:30:28,920
right so this is currently

6083
03:30:28,920 --> 03:30:30,920
uh

6084
03:30:30,920 --> 03:30:32,920
oh i guess it didn't update so you

6085
03:30:32,920 --> 03:30:34,920
can see like all the stats wait i'll update

6086
03:30:34,920 --> 03:30:36,920
it to the new one hold on

6087
03:30:36,920 --> 03:30:38,920
um it didn't update too much

6088
03:30:38,920 --> 03:30:40,920
cause i'm live

6089
03:30:40,920 --> 03:30:42,920
boom

6090
03:30:42,920 --> 03:30:44,920
so if you've never seen the behind the scenes before

6091
03:30:44,920 --> 03:30:46,920
this is what it looks like when you

6092
03:30:46,920 --> 03:30:48,920
upload a youtube video

6093
03:30:48,920 --> 03:30:50,920
these are the statistics

6094
03:30:50,920 --> 03:30:52,920
you get you get your viewers you get

6095
03:30:52,920 --> 03:30:54,920
your watch time you get the subscribers that

6096
03:30:54,920 --> 03:30:56,920
were directly earned

6097
03:30:56,920 --> 03:30:58,920
from that video so people

6098
03:30:58,920 --> 03:31:00,920
discovered that video for the first time and they click

6099
03:31:00,920 --> 03:31:02,920
subscribe because they really enjoyed me

6100
03:31:02,920 --> 03:31:04,920
pleading with you to let me hold

6101
03:31:04,920 --> 03:31:06,920
it as much

6102
03:31:06,920 --> 03:31:08,920
um the reason why

6103
03:31:08,920 --> 03:31:10,920
estimated revenue is not

6104
03:31:10,920 --> 03:31:12,920
visible is because it takes 48

6105
03:31:12,920 --> 03:31:14,920
hours for that statistic to update

6106
03:31:14,920 --> 03:31:16,920
if you guys really want to see it

6107
03:31:16,920 --> 03:31:18,920
i'm more than happy to share it doesn't bother me

6108
03:31:18,920 --> 03:31:20,920
none and

6109
03:31:20,920 --> 03:31:22,920
i and then you guys can

6110
03:31:22,920 --> 03:31:24,920
kind of see the fun behind the scenes but

6111
03:31:24,920 --> 03:31:26,920
yep um that's

6112
03:31:26,920 --> 03:31:28,920
what it looks like it says the video has got

6113
03:31:28,920 --> 03:31:30,920
18.7

6114
03:31:30,920 --> 03:31:32,920
51 views

6115
03:31:32,920 --> 03:31:34,920
like subscribe smash the

6116
03:31:34,920 --> 03:31:36,920
smash the bell member

6117
03:31:36,920 --> 03:31:38,920
share the video yes um

6118
03:31:38,920 --> 03:31:40,920
but yeah that

6119
03:31:40,920 --> 03:31:42,920
that is fantastic

6120
03:31:42,920 --> 03:31:44,920
you can see the little trend if you see that

6121
03:31:44,920 --> 03:31:46,920
right right side trend

6122
03:31:46,920 --> 03:31:48,920
and you can see when the video was

6123
03:31:48,920 --> 03:31:50,920
released it had the highest view point

6124
03:31:50,920 --> 03:31:52,920
and then now it's still actually going

6125
03:31:52,920 --> 03:31:54,920
pretty strong it's not

6126
03:31:54,920 --> 03:31:56,920
doing bad at all it really

6127
03:31:56,920 --> 03:31:58,920
doesn't um

6128
03:31:58,920 --> 03:32:00,920
but yeah i'm more than happy to show that

6129
03:32:00,920 --> 03:32:02,920
kind of cool behind the scenes stuff

6130
03:32:02,920 --> 03:32:04,920
you have went from 555

6131
03:32:04,920 --> 03:32:06,920
to 5.8 the stream

6132
03:32:06,920 --> 03:32:08,920
mmm

6133
03:32:08,920 --> 03:32:10,920
like that video is like propelling me forward

6134
03:32:10,920 --> 03:32:12,920
i'm hoping the same happens for the other girls

6135
03:32:12,920 --> 03:32:14,920
meme asmr

6136
03:32:14,920 --> 03:32:16,920
because i am not putting

6137
03:32:16,920 --> 03:32:18,920
any advertisement money into

6138
03:32:18,920 --> 03:32:20,920
myself i had to

6139
03:32:20,920 --> 03:32:22,920
at debut because we kept getting

6140
03:32:22,920 --> 03:32:24,920
called below the 1k and we needed the

6141
03:32:24,920 --> 03:32:26,920
1k for

6142
03:32:26,920 --> 03:32:28,920
redirecting into each other

6143
03:32:28,920 --> 03:32:30,920
um

6144
03:32:30,920 --> 03:32:32,920

03:33:18,920 --> 03:33:20,920
i'm not watching this shit live

6169
03:33:20,920 --> 03:33:22,920
and then they'll only just watch the asmr videos

6170
03:33:22,920 --> 03:33:24,920
and just like that

6171
03:33:24,920 --> 03:33:26,920
i have gatekeep myself successfully

6172
03:33:26,920 --> 03:33:28,920

you're welcome

6175
03:33:32,920 --> 03:33:34,920
that's right i've been sitting on this plan for a year

6176
03:33:34,920 --> 03:33:36,920
and i will scoop it from the rooftop

6177
03:33:36,920 --> 03:33:38,920
but that's the best part

6178
03:33:38,920 --> 03:33:40,920
yes because people will be like i want

6179
03:33:40,920 --> 03:33:42,920

6180
03:33:42,920 --> 03:33:44,920
but you're not doing asmr live stream

6181
03:33:44,920 --> 03:33:46,920
and it's like no no i'm not

6182
03:33:46,920 --> 03:33:48,920
what you're gonna do about it you're gonna leave

6183
03:33:48,920 --> 03:33:50,920
oh no my

6184
03:33:50,920 --> 03:33:52,920
how do you call it a tight knit community

6185
03:33:52,920 --> 03:33:54,920
oh no my tight knit community

6186
03:33:54,920 --> 03:33:56,920
terrible we're in shambles

6187
03:33:56,920 --> 03:33:58,920
even though i'm finding major success

6188
03:33:58,920 --> 03:34:00,920
truly in shambles i'm on my knees

6189
03:34:00,920 --> 03:34:02,920
but yeah you're welcome

6190
03:34:02,920 --> 03:34:04,920
don't think that will work for long

6191
03:34:04,920 --> 03:34:06,920
well you'll be surprised

6192
03:34:06,920 --> 03:34:08,920
i've spoken to other asmr creators

6193
03:34:08,920 --> 03:34:10,920
especially twitch asmr creators

6194
03:34:10,920 --> 03:34:12,920
i had a friend

6195
03:34:12,920 --> 03:34:14,920
who used to stream asmr

6196
03:34:14,920 --> 03:34:16,920
and

6197
03:34:16,920 --> 03:34:18,920
she got

6198
03:34:18,920 --> 03:34:20,920
700 viewers

6199
03:34:20,920 --> 03:34:22,920
concurrent on asmr

6200
03:34:22,920 --> 03:34:24,920
and then she went and played a video game

6201
03:34:24,920 --> 03:34:26,920
and she got 40 viewers

6202
03:34:26,920 --> 03:34:28,920
and the entire chat

6203
03:34:28,920 --> 03:34:30,920
was spamming

6204
03:34:30,920 --> 03:34:32,920
someone would come in and spam when's your next asmr stream

6205
03:34:32,920 --> 03:34:34,920
and then leave again

6206
03:34:34,920 --> 03:34:36,920
it tried and true

6207
03:34:36,920 --> 03:34:38,920
i'm aware this

6208
03:34:38,920 --> 03:34:40,920
and it's gonna happen

6209
03:34:40,920 --> 03:34:42,920
it's just

6210
03:34:42,920 --> 03:34:44,920
facts

6211
03:34:44,920 --> 03:34:46,920
that logic is flawed

6212
03:34:46,920 --> 03:34:48,920
how dare you

6213
03:34:48,920 --> 03:34:50,920
how dare you say i'm dumb

6214
03:34:50,920 --> 03:34:52,920
even though i'm clearly dumb

6215
03:34:52,920 --> 03:34:54,920
but i've seen it happen on twitch

6216
03:34:54,920 --> 03:34:56,920
yeah

6217
03:34:56,920 --> 03:34:58,920
yeah it's not that uncommon for asmr streamers to branch out

6218
03:34:58,920 --> 03:35:00,920
yes no

6219
03:35:00,920 --> 03:35:02,920
it's a tactic

6220
03:35:02,920 --> 03:35:04,920
because i'm always gonna be a gamer

6221
03:35:04,920 --> 03:35:06,920
i'm always gonna be gaming every day

6222
03:35:06,920 --> 03:35:08,920
actually we're playing lego lord of the rings

6223
03:35:08,920 --> 03:35:10,920
i can't keep quiet about it

6224
03:35:10,920 --> 03:35:12,920
it's too back to back

6225
03:35:12,920 --> 03:35:14,920
streams again

6226
03:35:14,920 --> 03:35:16,920
i'm so excited

6227
03:35:16,920 --> 03:35:18,920
because on the first day

6228
03:35:18,920 --> 03:35:20,920
we play through all the missions

6229
03:35:20,920 --> 03:35:22,920
and

6230
03:35:22,920 --> 03:35:24,920
and

6231
03:35:24,920 --> 03:35:26,920
get like 100%

6232
03:35:26,920 --> 03:35:28,920
and then we get to play in middle earth and it's so fun

6233
03:35:28,920 --> 03:35:30,920
and i'm so excited to play

6234
03:35:30,920 --> 03:35:32,920
so yeah we get to play lego lord of the rings soon

6235
03:35:32,920 --> 03:35:34,920
and it's like one of my top games

6236
03:35:34,920 --> 03:35:36,920
because it's just so fun and perfect

6237
03:35:36,920 --> 03:35:38,920
although it always glitches out at this one ice lolly place

6238
03:35:38,920 --> 03:35:40,920
i will show you what i am always glitches out

6239
03:35:40,920 --> 03:35:42,920
and it annoys me to high heaven

6240
03:35:42,920 --> 03:35:44,920
because i've played the game all the time

6241
03:35:44,920 --> 03:35:46,920
lego lord of the rings

6242
03:35:46,920 --> 03:35:48,920
is super good lego game

6243
03:35:48,920 --> 03:35:50,920
will you still play hobbit afterwards

6244
03:35:50,920 --> 03:35:52,920
yes

6245
03:35:52,920 --> 03:35:54,920
i'll play hobo

6246
03:35:54,920 --> 03:35:56,920
4x67

6247
03:35:56,920 --> 03:35:58,920
i'll play lego hobbit

6248
03:35:58,920 --> 03:36:00,920
at a later date

6249
03:36:00,920 --> 03:36:02,920
it's not my favourite because

6250
03:36:02,920 --> 03:36:04,920
if you didn't know

6251
03:36:04,920 --> 03:36:06,920
well now you're gonna know

6252
03:36:06,920 --> 03:36:08,920
and insert my knowledge into your mind

6253
03:36:08,920 --> 03:36:10,920
um

6254
03:36:10,920 --> 03:36:12,920
lego hobbit is only 2 games long

6255
03:36:12,920 --> 03:36:14,920
and it just

6256
03:36:14,920 --> 03:36:16,920
abruptly ends

6257
03:36:16,920 --> 03:36:18,920
there's no public

6258
03:36:18,920 --> 03:36:20,920
explanation

6259
03:36:20,920 --> 03:36:22,920
that has been released

6260
03:36:22,920 --> 03:36:24,920
there are only theories

6261
03:36:24,920 --> 03:36:26,920
as to why only the 2

6262
03:36:26,920 --> 03:36:28,920
lego hobbit

6263
03:36:28,920 --> 03:36:30,920
2 hobbit first movies

6264
03:36:30,920 --> 03:36:32,920
were made

6265
03:36:32,920 --> 03:36:34,920
into the lego and not the third

6266
03:36:34,920 --> 03:36:36,920
but warner brother

6267
03:36:36,920 --> 03:36:38,920
being shitheads

6268
03:36:38,920 --> 03:36:40,920
it's just a mystery

6269
03:36:40,920 --> 03:36:42,920
why the game abruptly ends

6270
03:36:42,920 --> 03:36:44,920
at the 2 movie mark

6271
03:36:44,920 --> 03:36:46,920
but it just

6272
03:36:46,920 --> 03:36:48,920
is what it is

6273
03:36:48,920 --> 03:36:50,920
so unfortunately

6274
03:36:50,920 --> 03:36:52,920
i do not fully enjoy hobbit to the same way

6275
03:36:52,920 --> 03:36:54,920
i enjoy lord of the rings

6276
03:36:54,920 --> 03:36:56,920
i apologize

6277
03:36:56,920 --> 03:36:58,920
they lost the source code

6278
03:36:58,920 --> 03:37:00,920
no

6279
03:37:00,920 --> 03:37:02,920
i'm pretty sure warner brothers

6280
03:37:02,920 --> 03:37:04,920
is it warner brothers

6281
03:37:04,920 --> 03:37:06,920
as one of them

6282
03:37:06,920 --> 03:37:08,920
were being

6283
03:37:08,920 --> 03:37:10,920
they were being very

6284
03:37:10,920 --> 03:37:12,920
there was a lot of production issues

6285
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:14,920
with the movie hobbit and then to base

6286
03:37:14,920 --> 03:37:16,920
something off of the movie to get the rights

6287
03:37:16,920 --> 03:37:18,920
to do something it probably

6288
03:37:18,920 --> 03:37:20,920
was just getting even worse

6289
03:37:20,920 --> 03:37:22,920
the production issues on the hobbit

6290
03:37:22,920 --> 03:37:24,920
were insane

6291
03:37:24,920 --> 03:37:26,920
i've kinda spoken about it but peter jackson

6292
03:37:26,920 --> 03:37:28,920
he's the director

6293
03:37:28,920 --> 03:37:30,920
he became so violently

6294
03:37:30,920 --> 03:37:32,920
ill

6295
03:37:32,920 --> 03:37:34,920
tending the fire for mummy

6296
03:37:34,920 --> 03:37:36,920
he became so violently

6297
03:37:36,920 --> 03:37:38,920
ill

6298
03:37:38,920 --> 03:37:40,920
he lost a bunch of weight he developed stomach ulcers

6299
03:37:40,920 --> 03:37:42,920
honestly i felt like peter jackson

6300
03:37:42,920 --> 03:37:44,920
when we were developing gen 1

6301
03:37:44,920 --> 03:37:46,920
i was getting ill

6302
03:37:46,920 --> 03:37:48,920
i honestly convinced myself at a few points

6303
03:37:48,920 --> 03:37:50,920
i was like this is it this stomach pain i feel right now

6304
03:37:50,920 --> 03:37:52,920
i've done it i've done it peter jackson

6305
03:37:52,920 --> 03:37:54,920
and then got myself a freaking

6306
03:37:54,920 --> 03:37:56,920
ulcer in my stomach

6307
03:37:56,920 --> 03:37:58,920

6318
03:38:18,920 --> 03:38:20,920
when they're with the elves

6319
03:38:20,920 --> 03:38:22,920

03:38:22,920 --> 03:38:24,920
sentence of this freaking song

6321
03:38:24,920 --> 03:38:26,920
oh and

03:38:28,920 --> 03:38:30,920
who played the five string fiddle

6324
03:38:30,920 --> 03:38:32,920
he squeaked and he scored

6325
03:38:32,920 --> 03:38:34,920
and he quickened his tune oh wait i'm skipping

6326
03:38:34,920 --> 03:38:36,920
the lyrics someone needs to play the lyrics

6327
03:38:36,920 --> 03:38:38,920
of boffer's song

6328
03:38:38,920 --> 03:38:40,920

6330
03:38:42,920 --> 03:38:44,920
an inn there's an inn

6331
03:38:44,920 --> 03:38:46,920
there's a merry old inn

6332
03:38:46,920 --> 03:38:48,920
beneath the old grey hill

6333
03:38:48,920 --> 03:38:50,920
and there they brew a

6334
03:38:50,920 --> 03:38:52,920
beer so brown the man on the min himself

6335
03:38:52,920 --> 03:38:54,920
came down one night to drink his

6336
03:38:54,920 --> 03:38:56,920
wine

6337
03:38:56,920 --> 03:38:58,920
oh the osloor

6338
03:38:58,920 --> 03:39:00,920
had a tipsy cat

6339
03:39:00,920 --> 03:39:02,920
who played the five string fiddle

6340
03:39:02,920 --> 03:39:04,920
he squeaked and he scored and he quickened his tune

6341
03:39:04,920 --> 03:39:06,920
and the landlord

6342
03:39:06,920 --> 03:39:08,920
shook the man on the min

6343
03:39:08,920 --> 03:39:10,920
it's after three he said i can't remember the lyrics

6344
03:39:10,920 --> 03:39:12,920
you'll need to put the lyrics so i can sing it but

6345
03:39:12,920 --> 03:39:14,920
i freaking love that and i also hate

6346
03:39:14,920 --> 03:39:16,920
em and that's

6347
03:39:16,920 --> 03:39:18,920
what bill bull beggins hates

6348
03:39:18,920 --> 03:39:20,920
was it

6349
03:39:20,920 --> 03:39:22,920

6350
03:39:22,920 --> 03:39:24,920
into forks

6351
03:39:26,920 --> 03:39:28,920
and burn the corks

6352
03:39:30,920 --> 03:39:32,920

6353
03:39:32,920 --> 03:39:34,920

6354
03:39:34,920 --> 03:39:36,920

i can only do like old school m&m

6423
03:42:12,920 --> 03:42:14,920

6424
03:42:14,920 --> 03:42:16,920

18.2

6428
03:42:22,920 --> 03:42:24,920

6429
03:42:26,920 --> 03:42:28,920
2k

6430
03:42:28,920 --> 03:42:30,920

6435
03:42:38,920 --> 03:42:40,920
oh dk

6437
03:42:42,920 --> 03:42:44,920
i can't remember

6438
03:42:46,920 --> 03:42:48,920
yep

6439
03:42:48,920 --> 03:42:50,920
drink on and start singing them bars

6440
03:42:50,920 --> 03:42:52,920
literally

6441
03:42:52,920 --> 03:42:54,920
i can't wait to myself

6442
03:42:54,920 --> 03:42:56,920
believe

6443
03:42:56,920 --> 03:42:58,920
that's planet air

6444
03:42:58,920 --> 03:43:00,920
turns

6445
03:43:00,920 --> 03:43:02,920
slowly

6446
03:43:02,920 --> 03:43:04,920
it's hard to stay

6447
03:43:04,920 --> 03:43:06,920
say i'd rather stay awake

6448
03:43:06,920 --> 03:43:08,920
when i'm asleep

6449
03:43:08,920 --> 03:43:10,920
actually i'm gonna do a meme song cover

6450
03:43:12,920 --> 03:43:14,920
you guys inspired me during

6451
03:43:14,920 --> 03:43:16,920
my james cameron's avatar stream

6452
03:43:16,920 --> 03:43:18,920
i am going to make

6453
03:43:18,920 --> 03:43:20,920
a meme song cover

6454
03:43:20,920 --> 03:43:22,920
of drumroll

6455
03:43:22,920 --> 03:43:24,920
secret tunnel but scottish

6456
03:43:26,920 --> 03:43:28,920
the artwork for it

6457
03:43:28,920 --> 03:43:30,920
someone drew a meme artwork

6458
03:43:30,920 --> 03:43:32,920
of me which i need to reach out and ask for permission

6459
03:43:32,920 --> 03:43:34,920
to use for it

6460
03:43:36,920 --> 03:43:38,920
but someone drew me

6461
03:43:38,920 --> 03:43:40,920
and then in the next frame

6462
03:43:40,920 --> 03:43:42,920
i'm blasting a scottish meme

6463
03:43:42,920 --> 03:43:44,920
and i want to use that artwork

6464
03:43:44,920 --> 03:43:46,920
in the music video

6465
03:43:46,920 --> 03:43:48,920
so

6466
03:43:48,920 --> 03:43:50,920
i'm going to see if i can do it

6467
03:43:50,920 --> 03:43:52,920
so basically

6468
03:43:52,920 --> 03:43:54,920
two lovers

6469
03:43:54,920 --> 03:43:56,920
i'm gonna get someone to mix it so at least i'm not

6470
03:43:56,920 --> 03:43:58,920
monotone deaf on it

6471
03:43:58,920 --> 03:44:00,920
forbidden be one another

6472
03:44:00,920 --> 03:44:02,920
and i'm actually gonna have to

6473
03:44:02,920 --> 03:44:04,920
write the lyrics out for the music video maker

6474
03:44:04,920 --> 03:44:06,920
because they're gonna be like

6475
03:44:06,920 --> 03:44:08,920
what is fey

6476
03:44:08,920 --> 03:44:10,920
from fey

6477
03:44:12,920 --> 03:44:14,920
secret tunnel

6478
03:44:14,920 --> 03:44:16,920
secret tunnel

6479
03:44:16,920 --> 03:44:18,920
through the mountain

6480
03:44:18,920 --> 03:44:20,920
secret secret

6481
03:44:20,920 --> 03:44:22,920
secret tunnel

6482
03:44:22,920 --> 03:44:24,920
basically it's gonna be like less than 50 seconds

6483
03:44:24,920 --> 03:44:26,920
but i think it's funny

6484
03:44:26,920 --> 03:44:28,920
little question for mome

6485
03:44:28,920 --> 03:44:30,920
are we eventually going back to needy streamer

6486
03:44:30,920 --> 03:44:32,920
overload for other endings

6487
03:44:32,920 --> 03:44:34,920
mmm

6488
03:44:34,920 --> 03:44:36,920
maybe a membership stream

6489
03:44:36,920 --> 03:44:38,920
i don't want to play games

6490
03:44:38,920 --> 03:44:40,920
i've already done before

6491
03:44:40,920 --> 03:44:42,920
but a short game like that

6492
03:44:42,920 --> 03:44:44,920
is very good for membership streams

6493
03:44:44,920 --> 03:44:46,920
in my opinion and again if you're not

6494
03:44:46,920 --> 03:44:48,920
membered and you're listening please don't worry

6495
03:44:48,920 --> 03:44:50,920
i stream for free every single day you get free content

6496
03:44:50,920 --> 03:44:52,920
you get content out of the wazoo with me

6497
03:44:52,920 --> 03:44:54,920
okay just let me cook give me time

6498
03:44:54,920 --> 03:44:56,920
i just need a bit time

6499
03:44:56,920 --> 03:44:58,920
just need a bit of time yes

6500
03:44:58,920 --> 03:45:00,920
give me some time

6501
03:45:00,920 --> 03:45:02,920
yeah

6502
03:45:02,920 --> 03:45:04,920
a bit of time

6503
03:45:04,920 --> 03:45:06,920
wait

6504
03:45:06,920 --> 03:45:08,920
when are you planning to do the first membership stream

6505
03:45:08,920 --> 03:45:10,920
next

6506
03:45:10,920 --> 03:45:12,920
week once the schedule goes up

6507
03:45:12,920 --> 03:45:14,920
you will see the membership streams

6508
03:45:14,920 --> 03:45:16,920
i will have it listed on

6509
03:45:16,920 --> 03:45:18,920
the schedule there are three

6510
03:45:18,920 --> 03:45:20,920
membership streams next week

6511
03:45:20,920 --> 03:45:22,920
they are all at different days

6512
03:45:22,920 --> 03:45:24,920
as well to try and enable

6513
03:45:24,920 --> 03:45:26,920
members to try and

6514
03:45:26,920 --> 03:45:28,920
get a little cheeky

6515
03:45:28,920 --> 03:45:30,920
a little cheeky

6516
03:45:30,920 --> 03:45:32,920
shot

6517
03:45:32,920 --> 03:45:34,920
on

6518
03:45:34,920 --> 03:45:36,920
coming to join

6519
03:45:36,920 --> 03:45:38,920
i will vary the days as well and i'll vary the plots

6520
03:45:38,920 --> 03:45:40,920
but it is a watch along

6521
03:45:40,920 --> 03:45:42,920
a member ASMR

6522
03:45:42,920 --> 03:45:44,920
and a

6523
03:45:44,920 --> 03:45:46,920
tier list rating for the first

6524
03:45:46,920 --> 03:45:48,920
membership stream week

6525
03:45:48,920 --> 03:45:50,920
we're going to spend an awful long time

6526
03:45:50,920 --> 03:45:52,920
on that tier list rating so i do apologize

6527
03:45:52,920 --> 03:45:54,920
it's going to be a bit of an epic

6528
03:45:54,920 --> 03:45:56,920
bit of an epic

6529
03:45:56,920 --> 03:45:58,920
mmm

6530
03:45:58,920 --> 03:46:00,920
thank you

6531
03:46:00,920 --> 03:46:02,920
oh how's the toe

6532
03:46:02,920 --> 03:46:04,920
i

6533
03:46:04,920 --> 03:46:06,920
i might be

6534
03:46:06,920 --> 03:46:08,920
losing my toenail

6535
03:46:10,920 --> 03:46:12,920
so

6536
03:46:12,920 --> 03:46:14,920
i went to the doctor

6537
03:46:14,920 --> 03:46:16,920
managed to go to the doctor all good

6538
03:46:16,920 --> 03:46:18,920
and

6539
03:46:18,920 --> 03:46:20,920
they've given me

6540
03:46:20,920 --> 03:46:22,920
an option

6541
03:46:22,920 --> 03:46:24,920
they've given me an option

6542
03:46:24,920 --> 03:46:26,920
i can either remove a side of my toenail

6543
03:46:26,920 --> 03:46:28,920
or i can get the whole

6544
03:46:28,920 --> 03:46:30,920
thing taken off

6545
03:46:30,920 --> 03:46:32,920
and they told

6546
03:46:32,920 --> 03:46:34,920
me that

6547
03:46:34,920 --> 03:46:36,920
if i get

6548
03:46:36,920 --> 03:46:38,920
the side of it taken off

6549
03:46:38,920 --> 03:46:40,920
because of the shape

6550
03:46:40,920 --> 03:46:42,920
of my nails i have what's known as

6551
03:46:42,920 --> 03:46:44,920
C shape nails i have no idea

6552
03:46:44,920 --> 03:46:46,920
if anyone listening knows what that means

6553
03:46:46,920 --> 03:46:48,920
i have C shape nails

6554
03:46:48,920 --> 03:46:50,920
which means i

6555
03:46:50,920 --> 03:46:52,920
am more prone to this

6556
03:46:52,920 --> 03:46:54,920
issue

6557
03:46:54,920 --> 03:46:56,920
so they basically said

6558
03:46:56,920 --> 03:46:58,920
ingrown toenail that's what they said

6559
03:46:58,920 --> 03:47:00,920
i thought she cut into my skin

6560
03:47:00,920 --> 03:47:02,920
but she cut into my skin

6561
03:47:02,920 --> 03:47:04,920
and down the side of my nail

6562
03:47:04,920 --> 03:47:06,920
which is why it was so messed up

6563
03:47:06,920 --> 03:47:08,920
so

6564
03:47:08,920 --> 03:47:10,920
i have an option

6565
03:47:10,920 --> 03:47:12,920
to either get it cut on the side

6566
03:47:12,920 --> 03:47:14,920
a little bit or get the whole thing taken

6567
03:47:14,920 --> 03:47:16,920
off

6568
03:47:16,920 --> 03:47:18,920
and i've opted to get the whole thing taken

6569
03:47:18,920 --> 03:47:20,920
off because i can't be arsed

6570
03:47:20,920 --> 03:47:22,920
hahaha

6571
03:47:22,920 --> 03:47:24,920
i would just still love me

6572
03:47:24,920 --> 03:47:26,920
if i didn't have 10 toenails

6573
03:47:26,920 --> 03:47:28,920
they said

6574
03:47:28,920 --> 03:47:30,920
it doesn't grow back

6575
03:47:30,920 --> 03:47:32,920
for some reason your fingernails grow back

6576
03:47:32,920 --> 03:47:34,920
but your toes don't

6577
03:47:34,920 --> 03:47:36,920
so yeah

6578
03:47:36,920 --> 03:47:38,920
they said the risk

6579
03:47:38,920 --> 03:47:40,920
because of my nail shape

6580
03:47:40,920 --> 03:47:42,920
the risk of me having this problem

6581
03:47:42,920 --> 03:47:44,920
occurring is pretty high

6582
03:47:44,920 --> 03:47:46,920
but i thought i had normal toes

6583
03:47:46,920 --> 03:47:48,920
but apparently i have unique C shaped

6584
03:47:48,920 --> 03:47:50,920
toes wherever that means

6585
03:47:50,920 --> 03:47:52,920
yeah you still love me

6586
03:47:52,920 --> 03:47:54,920
yeah for some reason

6587
03:47:54,920 --> 03:47:56,920
if you lose your fingernail

6588
03:47:56,920 --> 03:47:58,920
it will grow back

6589
03:47:58,920 --> 03:48:00,920
your toenails do not have this ability

6590
03:48:00,920 --> 03:48:02,920
today i have learned

6591
03:48:02,920 --> 03:48:04,920
so i have opted

6592
03:48:04,920 --> 03:48:06,920
just to get it yanked off

6593
03:48:06,920 --> 03:48:08,920
it's coming up in a few days

6594
03:48:08,920 --> 03:48:10,920
i think

6595
03:48:10,920 --> 03:48:12,920
after my buckshot roulette

6596
03:48:12,920 --> 03:48:14,920
i am perfectly fine to stream

6597
03:48:14,920 --> 03:48:16,920
i asked i was like

6598
03:48:16,920 --> 03:48:18,920
my toes built different

6599
03:48:18,920 --> 03:48:20,920
i said is this going to put me

6600
03:48:20,920 --> 03:48:22,920
at a disadvantage

6601
03:48:22,920 --> 03:48:24,920
will i be able to

6602
03:48:24,920 --> 03:48:26,920
i need to be in bed rest

6603
03:48:26,920 --> 03:48:28,920
and they said as long as

6604
03:48:28,920 --> 03:48:30,920
it feels fine

6605
03:48:30,920 --> 03:48:32,920
i feel well

6606
03:48:32,920 --> 03:48:34,920
i am okay to set up

6607
03:48:34,920 --> 03:48:36,920
i am completely okay

6608
03:48:36,920 --> 03:48:38,920
to set up and stream

6609
03:48:38,920 --> 03:48:40,920
because i still want to stream smile

6610
03:48:40,920 --> 03:48:42,920
hahaha

6611
03:48:42,920 --> 03:48:44,920
because

6612
03:48:44,920 --> 03:48:46,920
if i needed bed rest

6613
03:48:46,920 --> 03:48:48,920
but i don't need bed rest for it

6614
03:48:48,920 --> 03:48:50,920
which is good for me

6615
03:48:50,920 --> 03:48:52,920
just means we can paint your toenails faster

6616
03:48:52,920 --> 03:48:54,920
honestly

6617
03:48:54,920 --> 03:48:56,920
should i show what it looks like

6618
03:48:56,920 --> 03:48:58,920
once it's healed up

6619
03:48:58,920 --> 03:49:00,920
they told me the healing takes a long time

6620
03:49:00,920 --> 03:49:02,920
so i am going to be taking

6621
03:49:02,920 --> 03:49:04,920
vitamins

6622
03:49:04,920 --> 03:49:06,920
i also have been advised

6623
03:49:06,920 --> 03:49:08,920
i need to go sit out in the sun for 5 minutes

6624
03:49:08,920 --> 03:49:10,920
to get my vitamin D up

6625
03:49:10,920 --> 03:49:12,920
if you didn't know your vitamin D

6626
03:49:12,920 --> 03:49:14,920
your scars heal faster

6627
03:49:14,920 --> 03:49:16,920
if winds heal fast

6628
03:49:16,920 --> 03:49:18,920
not a scar sorry if a wind doesn't heal fast

6629
03:49:18,920 --> 03:49:20,920
it becomes a scar

6630
03:49:20,920 --> 03:49:22,920
but i looked up some pictures

6631
03:49:22,920 --> 03:49:24,920
of what toes look like

6632
03:49:24,920 --> 03:49:26,920
that don't have a toenail

6633
03:49:26,920 --> 03:49:28,920
it doesn't look that gross to me

6634
03:49:28,920 --> 03:49:30,920
it just looks unique

6635
03:49:30,920 --> 03:49:32,920
and

6636
03:49:32,920 --> 03:49:34,920
oh no the feet lovers

6637
03:49:34,920 --> 03:49:36,920
are in shambles with me

6638
03:49:36,920 --> 03:49:38,920
i am so sorry if you are a foot lover

6639
03:49:38,920 --> 03:49:40,920
i recommend imibizo she is doing a foot cam stream this week

6640
03:49:40,920 --> 03:49:42,920
i am afraid i can no longer

6641
03:49:42,920 --> 03:49:44,920
take over

6642
03:49:44,920 --> 03:49:46,920
yeah

6643
03:49:46,920 --> 03:49:48,920
so

6644
03:49:48,920 --> 03:49:50,920
it's probably never going to get a pedicure again

6645
03:49:50,920 --> 03:49:52,920
i am sure that surprises no one

6646
03:49:52,920 --> 03:49:54,920
the funny thing was

6647
03:49:54,920 --> 03:49:56,920
i had looked up

6648
03:49:56,920 --> 03:49:58,920
stories about going and getting

6649
03:49:58,920 --> 03:50:00,920
pedicures done

6650
03:50:00,920 --> 03:50:02,920
and i was like that sounds so silly

6651
03:50:02,920 --> 03:50:04,920
that's never going to happen to me

6652
03:50:04,920 --> 03:50:06,920
the one time i go

6653
03:50:06,920 --> 03:50:08,920
and get my freaking toes done

6654
03:50:10,920 --> 03:50:12,920
but i am not mad honestly i find it

6655
03:50:12,920 --> 03:50:14,920
quite funny like some

6656
03:50:14,920 --> 03:50:16,920
people might be like oh my god how are you laughing at this

6657
03:50:16,920 --> 03:50:18,920
i don't know it's just funny

6658
03:50:18,920 --> 03:50:20,920
like i feel like your body

6659
03:50:20,920 --> 03:50:22,920
tells stories

6660
03:50:22,920 --> 03:50:24,920
and like my story

6661
03:50:24,920 --> 03:50:26,920
is like oh i got a pedicure done

6662
03:50:26,920 --> 03:50:28,920
for my reef lens and now i have

6663
03:50:28,920 --> 03:50:30,920
night and toenail

6664
03:50:30,920 --> 03:50:32,920
like i think that's a funny story

6665
03:50:32,920 --> 03:50:34,920
like i think that's serious like your body

6666
03:50:34,920 --> 03:50:36,920
is telling all these stories

6667
03:50:36,920 --> 03:50:38,920
of all the fun you had in your life

6668
03:50:38,920 --> 03:50:40,920
and i have a scar

6669
03:50:40,920 --> 03:50:42,920
on my boob

6670
03:50:42,920 --> 03:50:44,920
because

6671
03:50:44,920 --> 03:50:46,920
i handled a feral kitten

6672
03:50:46,920 --> 03:50:48,920
don't recommend ever picking up

6673
03:50:48,920 --> 03:50:50,920
a feral kitten but unfortunately it's an emergency situation

6674
03:50:50,920 --> 03:50:52,920
so i have a big scar

6675
03:50:52,920 --> 03:50:54,920
a little

6676
03:50:54,920 --> 03:50:56,920
well it's not big sorry it's a light white scar that goes

6677
03:50:56,920 --> 03:50:58,920
along my chest

6678
03:50:58,920 --> 03:51:00,920
and i just think these kind of things

6679
03:51:00,920 --> 03:51:02,920
are like little funny things

6680
03:51:02,920 --> 03:51:04,920
being like oh i remember when that happened

6681
03:51:04,920 --> 03:51:06,920
i burnt myself on my mum's

6682
03:51:06,920 --> 03:51:08,920
lamp

6683
03:51:08,920 --> 03:51:10,920
she had like a nightstand lamp shade thing

6684
03:51:10,920 --> 03:51:12,920
and i burnt myself on it and i've got a burn

6685
03:51:12,920 --> 03:51:14,920
on the back of my elbow

6686
03:51:14,920 --> 03:51:16,920
i think these are like funny kind of things

6687
03:51:16,920 --> 03:51:18,920
some people might be embarrassed about scars

6688
03:51:18,920 --> 03:51:20,920
or things going on with their body

6689
03:51:20,920 --> 03:51:22,920
but i'm like that's me

6690
03:51:22,920 --> 03:51:24,920
that's what makes me me

6691
03:51:24,920 --> 03:51:26,920
yeah i've got like a scar

6692
03:51:26,920 --> 03:51:28,920
on my knuckle

6693
03:51:28,920 --> 03:51:30,920
because i rode my bike

6694
03:51:30,920 --> 03:51:32,920
into an event

6695
03:51:32,920 --> 03:51:34,920
at my grand's house

6696
03:51:34,920 --> 03:51:36,920
it's just how i'm made up

6697
03:51:36,920 --> 03:51:38,920
it's just part of me

6698
03:51:38,920 --> 03:51:40,920
as a little child

6699
03:51:40,920 --> 03:51:42,920
sorry i just kicked the mic sorry i'm lifting

6700
03:51:42,920 --> 03:51:44,920
my feet up hold on

03:52:22,920 --> 03:52:24,920
we're like tindly saying brian

6720
03:52:26,920 --> 03:52:28,920
ah

6721
03:52:30,920 --> 03:52:32,920
honestly though i think that's like a pretty cool story

6722
03:52:32,920 --> 03:52:34,920
oh wait i did that way

6723
03:52:34,920 --> 03:52:36,920
to prematurely pardon me

6724
03:52:36,920 --> 03:52:38,920
thank you so much for the

6725
03:52:38,920 --> 03:52:40,920
the tip reluctant to say yes

6726
03:52:40,920 --> 03:52:42,920
i have it right now

6727
03:52:42,920 --> 03:52:44,920
i did tell you guys i am on painkillers

6728
03:52:44,920 --> 03:52:46,920
unfortunately it is

6729
03:52:46,920 --> 03:52:48,920
it's throbbing and not the good kind of

6730
03:52:48,920 --> 03:52:50,920
throbbing

6731
03:52:50,920 --> 03:52:52,920
i got it assessed

6732
03:52:52,920 --> 03:52:54,920
and booked me in

6733
03:52:54,920 --> 03:52:56,920
but like the doctor was super lovely

6734
03:52:56,920 --> 03:52:58,920
he was so nice

6735
03:52:58,920 --> 03:53:00,920
i have not had him as a doctor

6736
03:53:00,920 --> 03:53:02,920
because i normally have a chick doctor

6737
03:53:02,920 --> 03:53:04,920
and she's really nice

6738
03:53:04,920 --> 03:53:06,920
but like all the doctors in australia

6739
03:53:06,920 --> 03:53:08,920
shout out to the health care in australia

6740
03:53:08,920 --> 03:53:10,920
you guys are like actually nice

6741
03:53:10,920 --> 03:53:12,920
what the heck

6742
03:53:12,920 --> 03:53:14,920
you guys actually want to help people with their problems

6743
03:53:14,920 --> 03:53:16,920
what the heck

6744
03:53:16,920 --> 03:53:18,920
so yeah ripped to my ill fable

6745
03:53:18,920 --> 03:53:20,920
but i'll keep you guys updated

6746
03:53:20,920 --> 03:53:22,920
it's after the buckshot roulette stream

6747
03:53:22,920 --> 03:53:24,920
so after buckshot roulette

6748
03:53:24,920 --> 03:53:26,920
originally i was gonna do a foot cam

6749
03:53:26,920 --> 03:53:28,920
i'm gonna be honest i think i'm probably gonna be on an ice pack

6750
03:53:28,920 --> 03:53:30,920
by the time we're on buckshot roulette

6751
03:53:30,920 --> 03:53:32,920
i think we'll do heart cam

6752
03:53:32,920 --> 03:53:34,920
no we will not do heart cam

6753
03:53:34,920 --> 03:53:36,920
that's just my chest

6754
03:53:36,920 --> 03:53:38,920
we will do heart beat

6755
03:53:38,920 --> 03:53:40,920
i think azura has a heart beat monitor on

6756
03:53:40,920 --> 03:53:42,920
i was watching her play stardew

6757
03:53:42,920 --> 03:53:44,920
and i'm like what's 86

6758
03:53:44,920 --> 03:53:46,920
what's 82 what's 76

6759
03:53:46,920 --> 03:53:48,920
what's 81

6760
03:53:48,920 --> 03:53:50,920
oh my god it's her heart beat

6761
03:53:50,920 --> 03:53:52,920
she has a heart rate monitor on

6762
03:53:52,920 --> 03:53:54,920
i was like what

6763
03:53:54,920 --> 03:53:56,920
heart surgery cam honestly

6764
03:53:56,920 --> 03:53:58,920
the toe not growing back

6765
03:53:58,920 --> 03:54:00,920
could be different per person

6766
03:54:00,920 --> 03:54:02,920
woah your toe came back

6767
03:54:02,920 --> 03:54:04,920
aww they told me what they need to do

6768
03:54:04,920 --> 03:54:06,920
is like they completely

6769
03:54:06,920 --> 03:54:08,920
i'm not looking forward to it though

6770
03:54:08,920 --> 03:54:10,920
cause they said they have to do like 2 injections

6771
03:54:10,920 --> 03:54:12,920
and then yank your freaking nail out

6772
03:54:12,920 --> 03:54:14,920
which is kinda gross but hey ho

6773
03:54:14,920 --> 03:54:16,920
recovery

6774
03:54:16,920 --> 03:54:18,920
i think they said roughly 2 weeks so

6775
03:54:18,920 --> 03:54:20,920
if you guys really want to see it

6776
03:54:20,920 --> 03:54:22,920
i'll show you but

6777
03:54:22,920 --> 03:54:24,920
kinda gross

6778
03:54:24,920 --> 03:54:26,920
are you squiddling me right now

6779
03:54:26,920 --> 03:54:28,920
anonymous

6780
03:54:28,920 --> 03:54:30,920
maybe a new pedicure will fix the old one

6781
03:54:30,920 --> 03:54:32,920
is that not how it works

6782
03:54:32,920 --> 03:54:34,920
no anonymous sadly

6783
03:54:34,920 --> 03:54:36,920
the reason why

6784
03:54:36,920 --> 03:54:38,920
i had a plaster over my toe

6785
03:54:38,920 --> 03:54:40,920
is because

6786
03:54:40,920 --> 03:54:42,920
when they give you a pedicure

6787
03:54:42,920 --> 03:54:44,920
they cut around the skin and they cut your nail super short

6788
03:54:44,920 --> 03:54:46,920
because they're gonna apply

6789
03:54:46,920 --> 03:54:48,920
gel to it

6790
03:54:48,920 --> 03:54:50,920
and the girl

6791
03:54:50,920 --> 03:54:52,920
accidentally cut into the

6792
03:54:52,920 --> 03:54:54,920
side of my skin

6793
03:54:54,920 --> 03:54:56,920
and then cut into the nail

6794
03:54:56,920 --> 03:54:58,920
itself

6795
03:54:58,920 --> 03:55:00,920
which is why it's causing all these

6796
03:55:00,920 --> 03:55:02,920
problems and basically acting

6797
03:55:02,920 --> 03:55:04,920
infected

6798
03:55:04,920 --> 03:55:06,920
cause it's now growing into

6799
03:55:06,920 --> 03:55:08,920
my skin which sounds really gross

6800
03:55:08,920 --> 03:55:10,920
said it like that

6801
03:55:10,920 --> 03:55:12,920
but unfortunately

6802
03:55:12,920 --> 03:55:14,920
not happening

6803
03:55:14,920 --> 03:55:16,920
my poor elf able

6804
03:55:16,920 --> 03:55:18,920
did they say

6805
03:55:18,920 --> 03:55:20,920
anything about putting a chemical on it

6806
03:55:20,920 --> 03:55:22,920
to prevent

6807
03:55:22,920 --> 03:55:24,920
i think so i can't remember the full

6808
03:55:24,920 --> 03:55:26,920
conversation basically

6809
03:55:26,920 --> 03:55:28,920
the conversation was like

6810
03:55:28,920 --> 03:55:30,920
you've got this

6811
03:55:30,920 --> 03:55:32,920
what do you want to do this is what happens

6812
03:55:32,920 --> 03:55:34,920
if you cut the side of it it's a possibility

6813
03:55:34,920 --> 03:55:36,920
of coming back and cause of your nail shape

6814
03:55:36,920 --> 03:55:38,920
it's much more likely to happen again

6815
03:55:38,920 --> 03:55:40,920
or if you just get it off it's one and done

6816
03:55:40,920 --> 03:55:42,920
you don't have to come back

6817
03:55:42,920 --> 03:55:44,920
everything should be fine

6818
03:55:44,920 --> 03:55:46,920
i don't need antibiotics

6819
03:55:46,920 --> 03:55:48,920
it's not like that

6820
03:55:48,920 --> 03:55:50,920
it's just bad

6821
03:55:50,920 --> 03:55:52,920
so i

6822
03:55:52,920 --> 03:55:54,920
i'm just like get it over and done with

6823
03:55:54,920 --> 03:55:56,920
i want to be in and out i want to be back streaming

6824
03:55:56,920 --> 03:55:58,920
i don't want to have to like go back in

6825
03:55:58,920 --> 03:56:00,920
and all that

6826
03:56:00,920 --> 03:56:02,920
nah just take the whole thing off take off

6827
03:56:02,920 --> 03:56:04,920
we gotta go bald take it off we gotta go bald

6828
03:56:08,920 --> 03:56:10,920
thankfully because

6829
03:56:10,920 --> 03:56:12,920
i get to sit while i stream

6830
03:56:12,920 --> 03:56:14,920
as opposed to someone who's forced

6831
03:56:14,920 --> 03:56:16,920
to stand while they stream

6832
03:56:16,920 --> 03:56:18,920
question mark anyway

6833
03:56:18,920 --> 03:56:20,920
the healing

6834
03:56:20,920 --> 03:56:22,920
process isn't an issue

6835
03:56:22,920 --> 03:56:24,920
cause i explained i was like

6836
03:56:24,920 --> 03:56:26,920
i'm stronger

6837
03:56:26,920 --> 03:56:28,920
i don't have to be bed ridden for this

6838
03:56:28,920 --> 03:56:30,920
and he was like nah you're fine

6839
03:56:30,920 --> 03:56:32,920
if you're sitting for the full day then just sit

6840
03:56:32,920 --> 03:56:34,920
i need to change the bandages

6841
03:56:34,920 --> 03:56:36,920
though which i'm a bit

6842
03:56:36,920 --> 03:56:38,920
i don't know if it's gonna be gross

6843
03:56:38,920 --> 03:56:40,920
but i'll try my best to behave

6844
03:56:42,920 --> 03:56:44,920
uh

6845
03:56:44,920 --> 03:56:46,920
don't worry even if it doesn't grow back i don't care

6846
03:56:46,920 --> 03:56:48,920
yeah he's still like my

6847
03:56:48,920 --> 03:56:50,920
nine toenails

6848
03:56:50,920 --> 03:56:52,920
bandage changing

6849
03:56:52,920 --> 03:56:54,920
oh you're feeling brave

6850
03:56:54,920 --> 03:56:56,920
i think it's going to be

6851
03:56:56,920 --> 03:56:58,920
very

6852
03:56:58,920 --> 03:57:00,920
not pleasant

6853
03:57:02,920 --> 03:57:04,920
you'll have to wrap the top when you take a shower

6854
03:57:04,920 --> 03:57:06,920
i could probably take a bath easier

6855
03:57:06,920 --> 03:57:08,920
than a shower cause i can just like dive into the water

6856
03:57:08,920 --> 03:57:10,920
with my leg out of the bath

6857
03:57:10,920 --> 03:57:12,920
mummy streaming from the hospital bed

6858
03:57:12,920 --> 03:57:14,920
i probably would

6859
03:57:14,920 --> 03:57:16,920
i'm not even joking

6860
03:57:16,920 --> 03:57:18,920
i'd probably

6861
03:57:18,920 --> 03:57:20,920
if i was ever in a hospital for a long time

6862
03:57:20,920 --> 03:57:22,920
cause of whatever reason

6863
03:57:22,920 --> 03:57:24,920
i'd probably just buy a gaming laptop

6864
03:57:24,920 --> 03:57:26,920
import my model on it and be like right

6865
03:57:26,920 --> 03:57:28,920
that's it let's go

6866
03:57:28,920 --> 03:57:30,920
and then like the nurses come in

6867
03:57:30,920 --> 03:57:32,920
and they're like what are you doing

6868
03:57:32,920 --> 03:57:34,920
and i'm like oh don't worry about it

6869
03:57:34,920 --> 03:57:36,920
need me to chat

6870
03:57:36,920 --> 03:57:38,920
hospitals that's who would go hard

6871
03:57:38,920 --> 03:57:40,920
why

6872
03:57:42,920 --> 03:57:44,920
well we're almost at 7000

6873
03:57:44,920 --> 03:57:46,920
fishies

6874
03:57:46,920 --> 03:57:48,920
god we are getting through it

6875
03:57:48,920 --> 03:57:50,920
the question is are we going to finish the fishies

6876
03:57:50,920 --> 03:57:52,920
by the endurance

6877
03:57:52,920 --> 03:57:54,920
well you keep streaming from the shows how you

6878
03:57:54,920 --> 03:57:56,920
raise the nurses for real for real

6879
03:57:56,920 --> 03:57:58,920
why is it nurses are

6880
03:57:58,920 --> 03:58:00,920
so caked up for like no reason

6881
03:58:00,920 --> 03:58:02,920
i have a

6882
03:58:02,920 --> 03:58:04,920
i said i'm becoming a nurse only to

6883
03:58:04,920 --> 03:58:06,920
get an even larger rump

6884
03:58:06,920 --> 03:58:08,920
okay i'm gonna become a nurse

6885
03:58:08,920 --> 03:58:10,920

6886
03:58:10,920 --> 03:58:12,920
my friend

6887
03:58:12,920 --> 03:58:14,920

6888
03:58:14,920 --> 03:58:16,920

6889
03:58:16,920 --> 03:58:18,920
okay so true nurses

6890
03:58:18,920 --> 03:58:20,920

6891
03:58:20,920 --> 03:58:22,920
you can play old school rinscape on your phone

6892
03:58:22,920 --> 03:58:24,920
but i kinda stream it though

6893
03:58:24,920 --> 03:58:26,920
oh it's the bunny reefling

6894
03:58:26,920 --> 03:58:28,920
that i thought was telling me to hurt

6895
03:58:28,920 --> 03:58:30,920
myself because they gave me

6896
03:58:30,920 --> 03:58:32,920
fish food and poison

6897
03:58:32,920 --> 03:58:34,920
the 1002 smelly

6898
03:58:34,920 --> 03:58:36,920
socks in your bank

6899
03:58:36,920 --> 03:58:38,920
that's reeflings giving me a big

6900
03:58:38,920 --> 03:58:40,920
beauty

6901
03:58:40,920 --> 03:58:42,920
let's just say

6902
03:58:42,920 --> 03:58:44,920
there was no ink left

6903
03:58:44,920 --> 03:58:46,920
in the intent

6904
03:58:48,920 --> 03:58:50,920
strong it's your body your decision but

6905
03:58:50,920 --> 03:58:52,920
are you feeling you might regret it i couldn't

6906
03:58:52,920 --> 03:58:54,920
give less about

6907
03:58:54,920 --> 03:58:56,920
my toes i'm gonna be honest

6908
03:58:56,920 --> 03:58:58,920
i

6909
03:58:58,920 --> 03:59:00,920
don't

6910
03:59:00,920 --> 03:59:02,920
they don't do anything for me

6911
03:59:02,920 --> 03:59:04,920
i don't paint them

6912
03:59:04,920 --> 03:59:06,920
i'm not very feminine in terms

6913
03:59:06,920 --> 03:59:08,920
of getting my nails and toes done

6914
03:59:08,920 --> 03:59:10,920
it doesn't

6915
03:59:10,920 --> 03:59:12,920
affect me they told me it doesn't

6916
03:59:12,920 --> 03:59:14,920
affect my balance in any way

6917
03:59:14,920 --> 03:59:16,920
my feet will adjust very quickly

6918
03:59:16,920 --> 03:59:18,920
to applying pressure

6919
03:59:18,920 --> 03:59:20,920
while walking

6920
03:59:20,920 --> 03:59:22,920
i'm not trying to dismiss your thing

6921
03:59:22,920 --> 03:59:24,920
but the fun part is

6922
03:59:24,920 --> 03:59:26,920
if you put the meshy stick thing on the bed

6923
03:59:26,920 --> 03:59:28,920
if it comes off

6924
03:59:28,920 --> 03:59:30,920
yeah

6925
03:59:30,920 --> 03:59:32,920
that hurts to take that off

6926
03:59:32,920 --> 03:59:34,920
yeah

6927
03:59:34,920 --> 03:59:36,920
it doesn't bother me i've never been

6928
03:59:36,920 --> 03:59:38,920
into doing my nails or anything

6929
03:59:38,920 --> 03:59:40,920

6995
04:01:54,920 --> 04:01:56,920
hypnosis when you sway back and forth

6996
04:01:56,920 --> 04:01:58,920
and make us obey when soon

6997
04:01:58,920 --> 04:02:00,920
my first hypnosis

6998
04:02:00,920 --> 04:02:02,920
is forget your name

6999
04:02:02,920 --> 04:02:04,920
and your new name is reefling

7000
04:02:04,920 --> 04:02:06,920
you will respond to reefling you will get praises reefling etc

7001
04:02:06,920 --> 04:02:08,920
it will not have

7002
04:02:08,920 --> 04:02:10,920
permanent effects it will be

7003
04:02:10,920 --> 04:02:12,920
roughly 30 minutes long

7004
04:02:12,920 --> 04:02:14,920
but it will fade away

7005
04:02:14,920 --> 04:02:16,920
after two hours i'm going to do a two hour

7006
04:02:16,920 --> 04:02:18,920
fade effect

7007
04:02:18,920 --> 04:02:20,920
i am very cautious about doing any permanent

7008
04:02:20,920 --> 04:02:22,920
effects stuff it makes me

7009
04:02:22,920 --> 04:02:24,920
slightly nervous

7010
04:02:24,920 --> 04:02:26,920
very nervous

7011
04:02:26,920 --> 04:02:28,920
strony what if

7012
04:02:28,920 --> 04:02:30,920

7014
04:02:32,920 --> 04:02:34,920

7015
04:02:34,920 --> 04:02:36,920
who's been a naughty reefling

7016
04:02:36,920 --> 04:02:38,920
hmm

7017
04:02:38,920 --> 04:02:40,920
have you not been looking after yourself

7018
04:02:40,920 --> 04:02:42,920
reefling

7019
04:02:42,920 --> 04:02:44,920
how are we supposed to look after each other

7020
04:02:44,920 --> 04:02:46,920
if you don't

7021
04:02:46,920 --> 04:02:48,920
look after yourself

7022
04:02:48,920 --> 04:02:50,920
hmm

7023
04:02:50,920 --> 04:02:52,920
hmm

7024
04:02:52,920 --> 04:02:54,920
that's right i'm going to guilt trip you into looking

7025
04:02:54,920 --> 04:02:56,920
after yourself and there's nothing you can do

7026
04:02:56,920 --> 04:02:58,920
about it

7027
04:02:58,920 --> 04:03:00,920
it's over for you reefling

7028
04:03:00,920 --> 04:03:02,920
it's over before it even started

7029
04:03:02,920 --> 04:03:04,920
okay this is too real

7030
04:03:04,920 --> 04:03:06,920
but i've already been permanently affected

7031
04:03:06,920 --> 04:03:08,920
by you momae

7032
04:03:10,920 --> 04:03:12,920
i stood at attention

7033
04:03:12,920 --> 04:03:14,920
i turned up

7034
04:03:14,920 --> 04:03:16,920
reefling

7035
04:03:16,920 --> 04:03:18,920
time to line up it's time for your daily

7036
04:03:18,920 --> 04:03:20,920
inking

7037
04:03:20,920 --> 04:03:22,920
what hole are you going to get it's a surprise

7038
04:03:24,920 --> 04:03:26,920
that's terrible

7039
04:03:26,920 --> 04:03:28,920
why do i say these things out loud

7040
04:03:28,920 --> 04:03:30,920
also me when

7041
04:03:30,920 --> 04:03:32,920
my content gets limited

7042
04:03:32,920 --> 04:03:34,920
i had some curious i wonder why

7043
04:03:34,920 --> 04:03:36,920
hmm

7044
04:03:36,920 --> 04:03:38,920
thanks on you

7045
04:03:38,920 --> 04:03:40,920
my name's already been reefling for a week

7046
04:03:40,920 --> 04:03:42,920
oh wait it has

7047
04:03:42,920 --> 04:03:44,920
literally because you're cold reefling

7048
04:03:44,920 --> 04:03:46,920
i like surprises

7049
04:03:46,920 --> 04:03:48,920
sounds like a bit

7050
04:03:48,920 --> 04:03:50,920
the game is right from the start

7051
04:03:50,920 --> 04:03:52,920
it's inking time not yet

7052
04:03:54,920 --> 04:03:56,920
not yet

7053
04:03:56,920 --> 04:03:58,920
because we like it

7054
04:03:58,920 --> 04:04:00,920
the algorithm must be haunted

7055
04:04:00,920 --> 04:04:02,920
hmm

7056
04:04:02,920 --> 04:04:04,920
actually i need to

7057
04:04:04,920 --> 04:04:06,920
tell the girls to be careful

7058
04:04:06,920 --> 04:04:08,920
and say more substitute words

7059
04:04:08,920 --> 04:04:10,920
so if you didn't know

7060
04:04:10,920 --> 04:04:12,920
youtube auto caption streams

7061
04:04:12,920 --> 04:04:14,920
doesn't even matter for the full 12 hours

7062
04:04:14,920 --> 04:04:16,920
youtube auto caption it

7063
04:04:16,920 --> 04:04:18,920
and the problem with that is

7064
04:04:18,920 --> 04:04:20,920
that's why you need to do

7065
04:04:20,920 --> 04:04:22,920
substitute words because it will identify

7066
04:04:22,920 --> 04:04:24,920
the rate of things being said

7067
04:04:24,920 --> 04:04:26,920
and it'll be so you can swear sometimes

7068
04:04:26,920 --> 04:04:28,920
but if you swear too much

7069
04:04:28,920 --> 04:04:30,920
you're in trouble you know what i mean

7070
04:04:30,920 --> 04:04:32,920
so

7071
04:04:32,920 --> 04:04:34,920

7072
04:04:34,920 --> 04:04:36,920
some

7073
04:04:36,920 --> 04:04:38,920

7075
04:04:40,920 --> 04:04:42,920

7083
04:05:06,920 --> 04:05:08,920

7085
04:05:10,920 --> 04:05:12,920
are you being saying like oh i

7086
04:05:12,920 --> 04:05:14,920
instead of like yes

7087
04:05:14,920 --> 04:05:16,920
you're like mmm i can do that

7088
04:05:16,920 --> 04:05:18,920

04:05:22,920 --> 04:05:24,920
i can and they're all looking at you

7092
04:05:24,920 --> 04:05:26,920
like what

7093
04:05:26,920 --> 04:05:28,920
you didn't tell us you were Scottish

7094
04:05:28,920 --> 04:05:30,920
you're like oh oh oh

7095
04:05:30,920 --> 04:05:32,920
just pull the old

7096
04:05:32,920 --> 04:05:34,920
brian assimilation any percent

7097
04:05:34,920 --> 04:05:36,920
that's amazing

7098
04:05:38,920 --> 04:05:40,920
oh emi's

7099
04:05:40,920 --> 04:05:42,920
vaude is totally not going to be kept up

7100
04:05:42,920 --> 04:05:44,920
even after editing out

7101
04:05:44,920 --> 04:05:46,920
she's already on a warning

7102
04:05:46,920 --> 04:05:48,920
so i'm very worried about as you're in emi

7103
04:05:48,920 --> 04:05:50,920
at this stage

7104
04:05:50,920 --> 04:05:52,920
i don't want to tell the girls like hey you need to like knock

7105
04:05:52,920 --> 04:05:54,920
it off because that's not fun for anyone

7106
04:05:54,920 --> 04:05:56,920
sorry my microphone is

7107
04:05:56,920 --> 04:05:58,920
just playing a prank on me

7108
04:05:58,920 --> 04:06:00,920
they're pranking me john the Scottish accent

7109
04:06:00,920 --> 04:06:02,920
it's funny until it's too late

7110
04:06:04,920 --> 04:06:06,920
to be honest i've started typing

7111
04:06:06,920 --> 04:06:08,920
i a lot more

7112
04:06:08,920 --> 04:06:10,920
hmmm

7113
04:06:10,920 --> 04:06:12,920
how do warnings work

7114
04:06:12,920 --> 04:06:14,920
so none of the girls have a strike

7115
04:06:14,920 --> 04:06:16,920
on their youtube channel

7116
04:06:16,920 --> 04:06:18,920
but they have a warning

7117
04:06:18,920 --> 04:06:20,920
that lasts 90 days

7118
04:06:20,920 --> 04:06:22,920
3 months

7119
04:06:22,920 --> 04:06:24,920
so if they were to do something

7120
04:06:24,920 --> 04:06:26,920
against tos they get a full strike

7121
04:06:26,920 --> 04:06:28,920
which limits them

7122
04:06:28,920 --> 04:06:30,920
for a week

7123
04:06:30,920 --> 04:06:32,920
they can't do anything for a week

7124
04:06:32,920 --> 04:06:34,920
they can't upload

7125
04:06:34,920 --> 04:06:36,920
they can't update, they can't do this, they can't do that

7126
04:06:36,920 --> 04:06:38,920
and i am a bit

7127
04:06:38,920 --> 04:06:40,920
nervous

7128
04:06:40,920 --> 04:06:42,920
but as soon as the warning expires

7129
04:06:42,920 --> 04:06:44,920
at the 90 day mark

7130
04:06:44,920 --> 04:06:46,920
i think

7131
04:06:46,920 --> 04:06:48,920
all is good at that but what the heck

7132
04:06:48,920 --> 04:06:50,920
is that

7133
04:06:50,920 --> 04:06:52,920
what the hell

7134
04:06:52,920 --> 04:06:54,920
oh my

7135
04:06:54,920 --> 04:06:56,920
there's no way

7136
04:06:56,920 --> 04:06:58,920
way

7137
04:06:58,920 --> 04:07:00,920
hold on big ass he's right

7138
04:07:02,920 --> 04:07:04,920
it's not

7139
04:07:04,920 --> 04:07:06,920
messed up because

7140
04:07:06,920 --> 04:07:08,920
it gives a warning

7141
04:07:08,920 --> 04:07:10,920
and not a strike

7142
04:07:10,920 --> 04:07:12,920
but the length

7143
04:07:12,920 --> 04:07:14,920
being 90 days is pretty rough

7144
04:07:14,920 --> 04:07:16,920
i have to admit considering

7145
04:07:16,920 --> 04:07:18,920
youtube haven't announced their new

7146
04:07:18,920 --> 04:07:20,920
updated tos or their stealth

7147
04:07:20,920 --> 04:07:22,920
tos wherever you want to call it at this rate

7148
04:07:22,920 --> 04:07:24,920
um

7149
04:07:24,920 --> 04:07:26,920
it's a bit messed up because

7150
04:07:26,920 --> 04:07:28,920
they've updated it but because they gave

7151
04:07:28,920 --> 04:07:30,920
a warning

7152
04:07:30,920 --> 04:07:32,920
if they gave a strike then yes i would agree

7153
04:07:32,920 --> 04:07:34,920
and say that's really not fair

7154
04:07:34,920 --> 04:07:36,920
because you've not

7155
04:07:36,920 --> 04:07:38,920
you've yet to say that ASMR ear licking

7156
04:07:38,920 --> 04:07:40,920
is against the rules yet even though

7157
04:07:40,920 --> 04:07:42,920
you're applying it

7158
04:07:42,920 --> 04:07:44,920
um

7159
04:07:44,920 --> 04:07:46,920
type thing

7160
04:07:46,920 --> 04:07:48,920
but yeah so i have to confess

7161
04:07:48,920 --> 04:07:50,920
i've reached 90 cooking 3 times

7162
04:07:50,920 --> 04:07:52,920
before this stream you cannot have

7163
04:07:52,920 --> 04:07:54,920
i only started like a week ago

7164
04:07:56,920 --> 04:07:58,920
you can't you mean

7165
04:07:58,920 --> 04:08:00,920
before though like before

7166
04:08:00,920 --> 04:08:02,920
you can't have done 99

7167
04:08:02,920 --> 04:08:04,920
because that's like

7168
04:08:04,920 --> 04:08:06,920
they say it tastes like 81

7169
04:08:06,920 --> 04:08:08,920
hours to do 99 or something

7170
04:08:08,920 --> 04:08:10,920
oh azura got a warning

7171
04:08:10,920 --> 04:08:12,920
for eating a cookie unfortunately yes

7172
04:08:12,920 --> 04:08:14,920
like azura

7173
04:08:14,920 --> 04:08:16,920
i don't know what's going on with azura

7174
04:08:16,920 --> 04:08:18,920
she wanted to do

7175
04:08:18,920 --> 04:08:20,920
an exercise ASMR stream

7176
04:08:20,920 --> 04:08:22,920
and unfortunately

7177
04:08:22,920 --> 04:08:24,920
management was like

7178
04:08:24,920 --> 04:08:26,920
bruv you're gonna get a strike for that

7179
04:08:26,920 --> 04:08:28,920
you literally got in trouble

7180
04:08:28,920 --> 04:08:30,920
for eating a cookie

7181
04:08:30,920 --> 04:08:32,920
what makes you think you can do heavy breathing ASMR

7182
04:08:32,920 --> 04:08:34,920
working out

7183
04:08:34,920 --> 04:08:36,920
and it's such a shame because i never want to say

7184
04:08:36,920 --> 04:08:38,920
no to the girls

7185
04:08:38,920 --> 04:08:40,920
but

7186
04:08:40,920 --> 04:08:42,920
i don't want to risk her money like her income

7187
04:08:42,920 --> 04:08:44,920
i know she's not monetized yet but she's about to be

7188
04:08:44,920 --> 04:08:46,920
i do not want to risk her monetization

7189
04:08:46,920 --> 04:08:48,920
and

7190
04:08:48,920 --> 04:08:50,920
like if she wanted to

7191
04:08:50,920 --> 04:08:52,920
record it and upload it

7192
04:08:52,920 --> 04:08:54,920
like on twitter that's fine

7193
04:08:54,920 --> 04:08:56,920
i have no issues with that

7194
04:08:56,920 --> 04:08:58,920
the cookie embargo honestly

7195
04:08:58,920 --> 04:09:00,920
yeah the sounds youtube sucks

7196
04:09:00,920 --> 04:09:02,920
and

7197
04:09:02,920 --> 04:09:04,920
yeah she wanted to do work out ASMR

7198
04:09:04,920 --> 04:09:06,920
but that would result in like heavy breathing

7199
04:09:06,920 --> 04:09:08,920
in the mic and

7200
04:09:08,920 --> 04:09:10,920
i don't know what is going on at youtube

7201
04:09:10,920 --> 04:09:12,920
headquarters but it is

7202
04:09:12,920 --> 04:09:14,920
absolutely

7203
04:09:14,920 --> 04:09:16,920
going to the dogs

7204
04:09:16,920 --> 04:09:18,920
i wish they would just come out and see what is and what isn't

7205
04:09:18,920 --> 04:09:20,920
instead of playing this weird

7206
04:09:20,920 --> 04:09:22,920
guessing game of like oh

7207
04:09:22,920 --> 04:09:24,920
but that's fine oh but that's not

7208
04:09:24,920 --> 04:09:26,920
fine

7209
04:09:32,920 --> 04:09:34,920
oh my god

7210
04:09:34,920 --> 04:09:36,920
but yeah the

7211
04:09:36,920 --> 04:09:38,920
very curious very curious

7212
04:09:38,920 --> 04:09:40,920
well i got a thousand

7213
04:09:40,920 --> 04:09:42,920
likes on that ASMR video hold on

7214
04:09:42,920 --> 04:09:44,920
in the money

7215
04:09:44,920 --> 04:09:46,920
you may not

7216
04:09:46,920 --> 04:09:48,920
have a cookie youtube literally

7217
04:09:48,920 --> 04:09:50,920
i think

7218
04:09:50,920 --> 04:09:52,920
because azura's voice is so

7219
04:09:52,920 --> 04:09:54,920
silky perfection and sex

7220
04:09:54,920 --> 04:09:56,920
who is why she got walloped

7221
04:09:56,920 --> 04:09:58,920
with it which is a shame because it's not fair

7222
04:09:58,920 --> 04:10:00,920
that's not fair at all

7223
04:10:00,920 --> 04:10:02,920
and because that is just her voice

7224
04:10:02,920 --> 04:10:04,920
i i'll tell

7225
04:10:04,920 --> 04:10:06,920
you something in the interview

7226
04:10:06,920 --> 04:10:08,920
with her i thought she was

7227
04:10:08,920 --> 04:10:10,920
putting it on and she was going to like

7228
04:10:10,920 --> 04:10:12,920
reveal her voice to me in the interview

7229
04:10:12,920 --> 04:10:14,920
no that's just her voice she's just

7230
04:10:14,920 --> 04:10:16,920
straight up a goddess

7231
04:10:16,920 --> 04:10:18,920
no questions asked

7232
04:10:18,920 --> 04:10:20,920
hmm

7233
04:10:20,920 --> 04:10:22,920
purple burglar

7234
04:10:22,920 --> 04:10:24,920
you're the second one

7235
04:10:24,920 --> 04:10:26,920
you're the second one i see you

7236
04:10:26,920 --> 04:10:28,920
see you taking it

7237
04:10:28,920 --> 04:10:30,920
um literally

7238
04:10:30,920 --> 04:10:32,920
punished her for her default voice

7239
04:10:32,920 --> 04:10:34,920
i thought literally there was a lot of

7240
04:10:34,920 --> 04:10:36,920
actually there was a really interesting thing about the

7241
04:10:36,920 --> 04:10:38,920
introduce yourself videos

7242
04:10:38,920 --> 04:10:40,920
a lot of people did their

7243
04:10:40,920 --> 04:10:42,920
character voice that they currently

7244
04:10:42,920 --> 04:10:44,920
like do as a vtuber and then they were like

7245
04:10:44,920 --> 04:10:46,920
hi viewer

7246
04:10:46,920 --> 04:10:48,920
in their actual voice

7247
04:10:48,920 --> 04:10:50,920
and it was quite interesting

7248
04:10:50,920 --> 04:10:52,920
it was nice seeing the swap

7249
04:10:52,920 --> 04:10:54,920
and i was convinced i was like oh azura is like

7250
04:10:54,920 --> 04:10:56,920
yeah putting on a voice and i did the

7251
04:10:56,920 --> 04:10:58,920
interview and i was like oh

7252
04:10:58,920 --> 04:11:00,920
i didn't even know people had goddess voices

7253
04:11:00,920 --> 04:11:02,920
like this um

7254
04:11:02,920 --> 04:11:04,920
do you know how much money i would make with your voice

7255
04:11:04,920 --> 04:11:06,920
yes thank you give it to me now

7256
04:11:06,920 --> 04:11:08,920

get your tentacle out

7269
04:11:38,920 --> 04:11:40,920
and then get your lotion

7270
04:11:40,920 --> 04:11:42,920
and have a wee go at your tentacle

7271
04:11:42,920 --> 04:11:44,920
and then once you're ready you'll ink

7272
04:11:44,920 --> 04:11:46,920
everywhere thank you lads

7273
04:11:46,920 --> 04:11:48,920
that's literally how i thought

7274
04:11:48,920 --> 04:11:50,920
my demo recording went

7275
04:11:50,920 --> 04:11:52,920
it was absolutely awful

7276
04:11:52,920 --> 04:11:54,920
who's stunting on us with these lava

7277
04:11:54,920 --> 04:11:56,920
capes

7278
04:11:58,920 --> 04:12:00,920
vivi pronouncing it below

7279
04:12:00,920 --> 04:12:02,920
still sends me

7280
04:12:02,920 --> 04:12:04,920
it's adorable

7281
04:12:08,920 --> 04:12:10,920
i literally if i could steal the girls

7282
04:12:10,920 --> 04:12:12,920
voices it would be over for everyone

7283
04:12:12,920 --> 04:12:14,920
unanimously at once

7284
04:12:14,920 --> 04:12:16,920
i could do lollipop i could do

7285
04:12:16,920 --> 04:12:18,920
milk i could do me

7286
04:12:18,920 --> 04:12:20,920
i could do yandere

7287
04:12:20,920 --> 04:12:22,920
you know but i can't

7288
04:12:24,920 --> 04:12:26,920
but that's okay

7289
04:12:26,920 --> 04:12:28,920
because sometimes i can go

7290
04:12:28,920 --> 04:12:30,920
but the only way i can do this

7291
04:12:30,920 --> 04:12:32,920
is by closing my mouth basically

7292
04:12:36,920 --> 04:12:38,920
would you still watch me if i was a lollipop

7293
04:12:38,920 --> 04:12:40,920
beecher burn sounded like that

7294
04:12:40,920 --> 04:12:42,920

7301
04:12:54,920 --> 04:12:56,920
your family this dude

7302
04:12:56,920 --> 04:12:58,920

and i'll stay down here

7313
04:13:18,920 --> 04:13:20,920

7315
04:13:22,920 --> 04:13:24,920

i overthink stuff a lot

7384
04:15:50,920 --> 04:15:52,920
i'm overthinking it as always

7385
04:15:52,920 --> 04:15:54,920
i overthink stuff a lot

7386
04:15:54,920 --> 04:15:56,920

7387
04:15:56,920 --> 04:15:58,920
i'm not mimicking

7388
04:15:58,920 --> 04:16:00,920
it's not working

7389
04:16:00,920 --> 04:16:02,920
that was a terrible attempt

7390
04:16:02,920 --> 04:16:04,920
at least i tried

7391
04:16:04,920 --> 04:16:06,920
i sounded a lot better during the asmr

7392
04:16:06,920 --> 04:16:08,920
i think that went a lot better

7393
04:16:08,920 --> 04:16:10,920
agent smith

7394
04:16:10,920 --> 04:16:12,920
no

7395
04:16:12,920 --> 04:16:14,920
you should totally go take

7396
04:16:14,920 --> 04:16:16,920
a break and let us get

7397
04:16:16,920 --> 04:16:18,920

7398
04:16:18,920 --> 04:16:20,920

04:16:20,920 --> 04:16:22,920
mmmm

7400
04:16:22,920 --> 04:16:24,920
refractory period already up

7401
04:16:24,920 --> 04:16:26,920
i need my tea

7402
04:16:28,920 --> 04:16:30,920
if you could mimic the wheezing laugh

7403
04:16:30,920 --> 04:16:32,920
that would be impressive

7404
04:16:32,920 --> 04:16:34,920
does following someone stop me

7405
04:16:34,920 --> 04:16:36,920
from being kicked from afk

7406
04:16:36,920 --> 04:16:38,920
i have no idea

7407
04:16:38,920 --> 04:16:40,920

i think i did mersey's laugh

7410
04:16:44,920 --> 04:16:46,920
pretty all right during the asmr stream

7411
04:16:48,920 --> 04:16:50,920
right when am i taking a break

7412
04:16:50,920 --> 04:16:52,920
when we get 69

7413
04:16:52,920 --> 04:16:54,920
yeah look we're almost there

7414
04:16:54,920 --> 04:16:56,920

7415
04:16:56,920 --> 04:16:58,920
i need to wash some dishes for a bit

7416
04:16:58,920 --> 04:17:00,920
oh you're such a good wheezing

7417
04:17:00,920 --> 04:17:02,920

thanks for

7419
04:17:04,920 --> 04:17:06,920
washing the dishes

7420
04:17:06,920 --> 04:17:08,920
do not attempt to mimic

7421
04:17:08,920 --> 04:17:10,920
mersey's laugh

7422
04:17:10,920 --> 04:17:12,920
if someone can send me a sample of it

7423
04:17:12,920 --> 04:17:14,920
like a time stamp

7424
04:17:16,920 --> 04:17:18,920
i might be able to

7425
04:17:20,920 --> 04:17:22,920
we're almost level 69

7426
04:17:22,920 --> 04:17:24,920
and then i will call we'll do a pee break

7427
04:17:24,920 --> 04:17:26,920
i'm gonna get loads of food and all of that

7428
04:17:26,920 --> 04:17:28,920
i'm gonna make another tea

7429
04:17:28,920 --> 04:17:30,920
sorry my bottle is crinkling away there

7430
04:17:32,920 --> 04:17:34,920
mmmm

7431
04:17:34,920 --> 04:17:36,920
please not this

7432
04:17:36,920 --> 04:17:38,920
the voice thief

7433
04:17:38,920 --> 04:17:40,920
not voice pyre safe

7434
04:17:40,920 --> 04:17:42,920
you steal the person's voice

7435
04:17:42,920 --> 04:17:44,920
they are mute forever

7436
04:17:44,920 --> 04:17:46,920
so who voice will be

7437
04:17:46,920 --> 04:17:48,920
my voice?

7438
04:17:48,920 --> 04:17:50,920
if you're on ruin light

7439
04:17:50,920 --> 04:17:52,920
you can look for the logout timer

7440
04:17:56,920 --> 04:17:58,920
like it's funny but i'm afraid

7441
04:17:58,920 --> 04:18:00,920
for her every time it starts

7442
04:18:00,920 --> 04:18:02,920
you're gonna record the

7443
04:18:02,920 --> 04:18:04,920
nooo

7444
04:18:04,920 --> 04:18:06,920

7474
04:19:18,920 --> 04:19:20,920

7475
04:19:20,920 --> 04:19:22,920

i don't want them to be one after another

7483
04:19:36,920 --> 04:19:38,920

7485
04:19:40,920 --> 04:19:42,920

7592
04:23:48,920 --> 04:23:50,920

you need to be there to witness it

7602
04:24:08,920 --> 04:24:10,920
you need to be there to agree to the amount

7603
04:24:10,920 --> 04:24:12,920
of charging you like you cannot just give me

7604
04:24:12,920 --> 04:24:14,920
like your car

7605
04:24:14,920 --> 04:24:16,920
your credit card that has no freaking pin on it

7606
04:24:16,920 --> 04:24:18,920
and

7607
04:24:18,920 --> 04:24:20,920

with me to the tail type thing

7610
04:24:24,920 --> 04:24:26,920
i was so shocked to learn

7611
04:24:26,920 --> 04:24:28,920
that in america

7612
04:24:28,920 --> 04:24:30,920
you part with your card super easily

7613
04:24:30,920 --> 04:24:32,920
there's no pin on it

7614
04:24:32,920 --> 04:24:34,920
the limits are like 5000 us dollars

7615
04:24:34,920 --> 04:24:36,920
i'm like

7616
04:24:36,920 --> 04:24:38,920
what there's no pin

7617
04:24:38,920 --> 04:24:40,920
put in a code

7618
04:24:40,920 --> 04:24:42,920
that's just a default

7619
04:24:46,920 --> 04:24:48,920
please if you're listening right now

7620
04:24:48,920 --> 04:24:50,920
make sure any card you own in your

7621
04:24:50,920 --> 04:24:52,920
worldly possessions has a pin on it

7622
04:24:52,920 --> 04:24:54,920
because that is

7623
04:24:54,920 --> 04:24:56,920
insanity i was like so

7624
04:24:56,920 --> 04:24:58,920
flabbergasted and ironically

7625
04:24:58,920 --> 04:25:00,920
the word is flabbergasted

7626
04:25:00,920 --> 04:25:02,920

so i was like why are you handing me your card

7629
04:25:06,920 --> 04:25:08,920

your entire life ooh being

04:28:40,920 --> 04:28:42,920
in debt bad debt bad

7737
04:28:42,920 --> 04:28:44,920
and yet the most

7738
04:28:44,920 --> 04:28:46,920
american infrastructure you have to

7739
04:28:46,920 --> 04:28:48,920
put a down payment to get a car type thing

7740
04:28:48,920 --> 04:28:50,920
and debt you can buy

7741
04:28:50,920 --> 04:28:52,920
things online in four installments

7742
04:28:52,920 --> 04:28:54,920
that's a debt

7743
04:28:54,920 --> 04:28:56,920
and then the worst

7744
04:28:56,920 --> 04:28:58,920
offender of all

7745
04:28:58,920 --> 04:29:00,920
mortgages

7746
04:29:00,920 --> 04:29:02,920
mortgages are just

7747
04:29:02,920 --> 04:29:04,920
normalized debt

7748
04:29:04,920 --> 04:29:06,920
for normalized

7749
04:29:06,920 --> 04:29:08,920
debt enslavement

7750
04:29:08,920 --> 04:29:10,920
there is no way you can guarantee

7751
04:29:10,920 --> 04:29:12,920
you're gonna have a perfect income

7752
04:29:12,920 --> 04:29:14,920
for 30 years

7753
04:29:14,920 --> 04:29:16,920
and then ah

7754
04:29:16,920 --> 04:29:18,920
ah i could absolutely

7755
04:29:18,920 --> 04:29:20,920
explode off the planet

7756
04:29:22,920 --> 04:29:24,920
they also close your account

7757
04:29:24,920 --> 04:29:26,920
if you don't use your card anyway

7758
04:29:26,920 --> 04:29:28,920
sorry what are mortgages

7759
04:29:28,920 --> 04:29:30,920
so a mortgage is when you go to a bank

7760
04:29:30,920 --> 04:29:32,920
and you say hello bank i would like to purchase

7761
04:29:32,920 --> 04:29:34,920
this house the bank will then

7762
04:29:34,920 --> 04:29:36,920
own your house

7763
04:29:36,920 --> 04:29:38,920
that you pay a monthly mortgage

7764
04:29:38,920 --> 04:29:40,920
into with astronomical

7765
04:29:40,920 --> 04:29:42,920
fees over the years

7766
04:29:42,920 --> 04:29:44,920
with the charged interest

7767
04:29:44,920 --> 04:29:46,920
by the time you have finished

7768
04:29:46,920 --> 04:29:48,920

mortgage with interest

7771
04:29:52,920 --> 04:29:54,920
you have paid an astronomical

7772
04:29:54,920 --> 04:29:56,920
amount that isn't even houses

7773
04:29:56,920 --> 04:29:58,920
aren't even valued the materials

7774
04:29:58,920 --> 04:30:00,920
of houses

7775
04:30:00,920 --> 04:30:02,920
aren't even at that value the

7776
04:30:02,920 --> 04:30:04,920
construction isn't even at that value

7777
04:30:04,920 --> 04:30:06,920
the entire system

7778
04:30:06,920 --> 04:30:08,920
is wrecked

7779
04:30:08,920 --> 04:30:10,920

ever feel embarrassed

7782
04:30:14,920 --> 04:30:16,920
about still living at home

7783
04:30:16,920 --> 04:30:18,920
with your parents do not

7784
04:30:18,920 --> 04:30:20,920

7785
04:30:20,920 --> 04:30:22,920
if you're in real life friends

7786
04:30:22,920 --> 04:30:24,920

7787
04:30:24,920 --> 04:30:26,920

are able to rent do not

7789
04:30:28,920 --> 04:30:30,920
ever feel embarrassed

7790
04:30:30,920 --> 04:30:32,920
about any of these aspects

7791
04:30:32,920 --> 04:30:34,920
you the system

7792
04:30:34,920 --> 04:30:36,920
is rigged against you

7793
04:30:36,920 --> 04:30:38,920
do not feel a shred

7794
04:30:38,920 --> 04:30:40,920
of it multi-generational

7795
04:30:40,920 --> 04:30:42,920
living was incredibly

7796
04:30:42,920 --> 04:30:44,920
common for

7797
04:30:44,920 --> 04:30:46,920
centuries

7798
04:30:46,920 --> 04:30:48,920
way before capitalism came

7799
04:30:48,920 --> 04:30:50,920
into the picture do not be

7800
04:30:50,920 --> 04:30:52,920
embarrassed about living with your

7801
04:30:52,920 --> 04:30:54,920
more living with your grand

7802
04:30:54,920 --> 04:30:56,920
that is your sense of community

7803
04:30:56,920 --> 04:30:58,920
is beautiful to even have that

7804
04:30:58,920 --> 04:31:00,920
and I would absolutely love

7805
04:31:00,920 --> 04:31:02,920
to see the uprising

7806
04:31:02,920 --> 04:31:04,920
of multi-generational households

7807
04:31:04,920 --> 04:31:06,920
I would absolutely love to

7808
04:31:06,920 --> 04:31:08,920
see the uprising of

7809
04:31:08,920 --> 04:31:10,920
people going back to farming

7810
04:31:10,920 --> 04:31:12,920
another thing in

7811
04:31:12,920 --> 04:31:14,920
World War I and World War II

7812
04:31:16,920 --> 04:31:18,920
people on mass

7813
04:31:18,920 --> 04:31:20,920
were instructed

7814
04:31:20,920 --> 04:31:22,920
on how to grow vegetables

7815
04:31:22,920 --> 04:31:24,920
at home with the rise

7816
04:31:24,920 --> 04:31:26,920
of supermarkets capitalism

7817
04:31:26,920 --> 04:31:28,920
who here

7818
04:31:28,920 --> 04:31:30,920
knows someone who grows

7819
04:31:30,920 --> 04:31:32,920
produce themselves

7820
04:31:32,920 --> 04:31:34,920
I know no one

7821
04:31:34,920 --> 04:31:36,920
I know no one

7822
04:31:36,920 --> 04:31:38,920
that grows produce themselves

7823
04:31:38,920 --> 04:31:40,920
because of how

7824
04:31:40,920 --> 04:31:42,920
how much lack of time

7825
04:31:42,920 --> 04:31:44,920
people have maybe

7826
04:31:44,920 --> 04:31:46,920
your grand may do it

7827
04:31:46,920 --> 04:31:48,920
because she has time because she is retired

7828
04:31:48,920 --> 04:31:50,920
did you know how common it was

7829
04:31:50,920 --> 04:31:52,920
to have a farm

7830
04:31:52,920 --> 04:31:54,920
to have farm animals

7831
04:31:54,920 --> 04:31:56,920
such as chickens how common it was

7832
04:31:56,920 --> 04:31:58,920
to grow even the most

7833
04:31:58,920 --> 04:32:00,920
basic of vegetable such as

7834
04:32:00,920 --> 04:32:02,920
potatoes such as tomatoes

7835
04:32:02,920 --> 04:32:04,920
such as peas

7836
04:32:04,920 --> 04:32:06,920
okay

7837
04:32:06,920 --> 04:32:08,920
you?

7838
04:32:08,920 --> 04:32:10,920
I want to see this

7839
04:32:10,920 --> 04:32:12,920
become a thing

7840
04:32:12,920 --> 04:32:14,920
another thing

7841
04:32:14,920 --> 04:32:16,920
notice how tiny gardens

7842
04:32:16,920 --> 04:32:18,920
are getting for houses

7843
04:32:18,920 --> 04:32:20,920

right and while I'm at it

7872
04:33:16,920 --> 04:33:18,920
sorry I just jumped up there in excitement

7873
04:33:18,920 --> 04:33:20,920
and while I'm at it

7874
04:33:20,920 --> 04:33:22,920
hmm

7875
04:33:22,920 --> 04:33:24,920
isn't it curious that garden

7876
04:33:24,920 --> 04:33:26,920
spaces for the average house

7877
04:33:26,920 --> 04:33:28,920
have been lessening and lessening

7878
04:33:28,920 --> 04:33:30,920
every year I wonder

7879
04:33:30,920 --> 04:33:32,920
do they want the people

7880
04:33:32,920 --> 04:33:34,920
not to have the ability to grow

7881
04:33:34,920 --> 04:33:36,920
produce in the means of their

7882
04:33:36,920 --> 04:33:38,920
own production for survival

7883
04:33:38,920 --> 04:33:40,920
hmmm

7884
04:33:40,920 --> 04:33:42,920
isn't that curious

7885
04:33:42,920 --> 04:33:44,920
isn't that curious that flats

7886
04:33:44,920 --> 04:33:46,920
massive sky scraping building blocks

7887
04:33:46,920 --> 04:33:48,920
have no garden space

7888
04:33:48,920 --> 04:33:50,920
so people cannot produce their own

7889
04:33:50,920 --> 04:33:52,920
produce their own vegetables

7890
04:33:52,920 --> 04:33:54,920
their own fruits their own herbs

7891
04:33:54,920 --> 04:33:56,920
so people are forced to

7892
04:33:56,920 --> 04:33:58,920
rely on supermarkets

7893
04:33:58,920 --> 04:34:00,920
yet again

7894
04:34:00,920 --> 04:34:02,920
capitalism strikes

7895
04:34:02,920 --> 04:34:04,920
isn't that curious

7896
04:34:04,920 --> 04:34:06,920
I find that so curious

7897
04:34:06,920 --> 04:34:08,920
at this day and age

7898
04:34:08,920 --> 04:34:10,920
with all these

7899
04:34:10,920 --> 04:34:12,920
advancements on building so many houses

7900
04:34:12,920 --> 04:34:14,920
the garden spaces are getting so tiny

7901
04:34:14,920 --> 04:34:16,920
you cannot even have a produce

7902
04:34:16,920 --> 04:34:18,920
producing tree and isn't it curious

7903
04:34:18,920 --> 04:34:20,920
that even when there are

7904
04:34:20,920 --> 04:34:22,920
fruit producing trees

7905
04:34:22,920 --> 04:34:24,920
that

7906
04:34:24,920 --> 04:34:26,920
they purposely don't have

7907
04:34:26,920 --> 04:34:28,920
fruit producing trees when they have to put trees down

7908
04:34:28,920 --> 04:34:30,920
instead they use pollen trees

7909
04:34:30,920 --> 04:34:32,920
which are good

7910
04:34:32,920 --> 04:34:34,920
I don't get me wrong they're good for the bugs

7911
04:34:34,920 --> 04:34:36,920
but they never give free

7912
04:34:36,920 --> 04:34:38,920
produce producing trees

7913
04:34:38,920 --> 04:34:40,920
I fucking saw a story where someone

7914
04:34:40,920 --> 04:34:42,920
got given lemons from

7915
04:34:42,920 --> 04:34:44,920
the garden and she didn't know that you could

7916
04:34:44,920 --> 04:34:46,920
just straight up cut the lemon open

7917
04:34:46,920 --> 04:34:48,920
and add it to the juice they thought it had to be

7918
04:34:48,920 --> 04:34:50,920
produce isn't it interesting

7919
04:34:50,920 --> 04:34:52,920
that in school you hardly

7920
04:34:52,920 --> 04:34:54,920
learn about the cycle of the farmers

7921
04:34:54,920 --> 04:34:56,920
and how you never are encouraged

7922
04:34:56,920 --> 04:34:58,920
to go to farmers markets

7923
04:34:58,920 --> 04:35:00,920
instead of the big fricking Tescos

7924
04:35:00,920 --> 04:35:02,920
or big as their big this or big that

7925
04:35:02,920 --> 04:35:04,920
talk your shit

7926
04:35:04,920 --> 04:35:06,920
damn straight I'll talk my shit

7927
04:35:06,920 --> 04:35:08,920
isn't that interesting

7928
04:35:08,920 --> 04:35:10,920
that you hardly even learn about seeds

7929
04:35:10,920 --> 04:35:12,920
seeds I will tell you

7930
04:35:12,920 --> 04:35:14,920
about seeds right now

7931
04:35:14,920 --> 04:35:16,920
to remember the three threat factors

7932
04:35:16,920 --> 04:35:18,920
of growing seeds it's what

7933
04:35:18,920 --> 04:35:20,920
W-O-T

7934
04:35:20,920 --> 04:35:22,920
water, oxygen, temperature

7935
04:35:22,920 --> 04:35:24,920
that is how you grow seeds

7936
04:35:26,920 --> 04:35:28,920
the other part of the fun is when

7937
04:35:28,920 --> 04:35:30,920
Monsanto tries to sue people for using their seeds

7938
04:35:30,920 --> 04:35:32,920
and another thing

7939
04:35:32,920 --> 04:35:34,920
there's states where you can't even collect

7940
04:35:34,920 --> 04:35:36,920
rainwater it is illegal to collect

7941
04:35:36,920 --> 04:35:38,920
rainwater what would you use

7942
04:35:38,920 --> 04:35:40,920
for rainwater hmm

7943
04:35:40,920 --> 04:35:42,920
you would water your own crops

7944
04:35:42,920 --> 04:35:44,920
with rainwater

7945
04:35:44,920 --> 04:35:46,920
bruv this

7946
04:35:46,920 --> 04:35:48,920
system is

7947
04:35:48,920 --> 04:35:50,920
fuck

7948
04:35:50,920 --> 04:35:52,920
it's beyond bull

7949
04:35:54,920 --> 04:35:56,920
don't look too deep into it

7950
04:35:56,920 --> 04:35:58,920
or you're not going to enjoy what you see

7951
04:35:58,920 --> 04:36:00,920
you have to look around

7952
04:36:00,920 --> 04:36:02,920
and say we live in a society

7953
04:36:02,920 --> 04:36:04,920
that's all we can do

7954
04:36:04,920 --> 04:36:06,920
Reeflings

7955
04:36:06,920 --> 04:36:08,920
we live in a society

7956
04:36:08,920 --> 04:36:10,920
amen

7957
04:36:10,920 --> 04:36:12,920
okay I'm going to get off my soap box

7958
04:36:12,920 --> 04:36:14,920
for a minute there

7959
04:36:14,920 --> 04:36:16,920
let me remove this asset

7960
04:36:16,920 --> 04:36:18,920
let me remove my tin foil hat

7961
04:36:18,920 --> 04:36:20,920
but don't think I won't put that hat back on

7962
04:36:20,920 --> 04:36:22,920
hold on actually

7963
04:36:22,920 --> 04:36:24,920
I have this hat

7964
04:36:24,920 --> 04:36:26,920
okay

7965
04:36:26,920 --> 04:36:28,920
we can put this hat on we're back to meman

7966
04:36:30,920 --> 04:36:32,920
okay it's a bit wonky but

7967
04:36:32,920 --> 04:36:34,920
it's really wonky

7968
04:36:34,920 --> 04:36:36,920
right above calm down we live

7969
04:36:36,920 --> 04:36:38,920
in a society

7970
04:36:38,920 --> 04:36:40,920
ooh

7971
04:36:40,920 --> 04:36:42,920
thank you for letting me rant about that

7972
04:36:42,920 --> 04:36:44,920
but it makes you think

7973
04:36:44,920 --> 04:36:46,920
it's illegal to collect rainwater

7974
04:36:46,920 --> 04:36:48,920
yes

7975
04:36:48,920 --> 04:36:50,920
but is that because

7976
04:36:50,920 --> 04:36:52,920
it might drinking water might be contaminated

7977
04:36:52,920 --> 04:36:54,920
why do you think that's contaminated

7978
04:36:54,920 --> 04:36:56,920
is it because these mega

7979
04:36:56,920 --> 04:36:58,920
corporations bribe

7980
04:36:58,920 --> 04:37:00,920
their way

7981
04:37:00,920 --> 04:37:02,920
into being allowed to pollute the waters

7982
04:37:02,920 --> 04:37:04,920
did you know in the UK

7983
04:37:04,920 --> 04:37:06,920
there is no

7984
04:37:06,920 --> 04:37:08,920
swimmable rivers

7985
04:37:08,920 --> 04:37:10,920
that are not toxic

7986
04:37:10,920 --> 04:37:12,920
for they are all actively

7987
04:37:12,920 --> 04:37:14,920
being polluted in

7988
04:37:14,920 --> 04:37:16,920
hmm did you know that

7989
04:37:16,920 --> 04:37:18,920
all in the name of what

7990
04:37:18,920 --> 04:37:20,920
reeflings

7991
04:37:20,920 --> 04:37:22,920
capitalism

7992
04:37:22,920 --> 04:37:24,920
shocking behavior

7993
04:37:24,920 --> 04:37:26,920
sorry I took my tin foil hat off

7994
04:37:26,920 --> 04:37:28,920
zero

7995
04:37:28,920 --> 04:37:30,920
yes zero

7996
04:37:32,920 --> 04:37:34,920
by the way I also have a friend who has like

7997
04:37:34,920 --> 04:37:36,920
20 different crops growing in his basement

7998
04:37:36,920 --> 04:37:38,920
so a garden is technically not needed

7999
04:37:38,920 --> 04:37:40,920
and that

8000
04:37:40,920 --> 04:37:42,920
should that gentleman be having those crops

8001
04:37:42,920 --> 04:37:44,920
right

8002
04:37:44,920 --> 04:37:46,920
I'll get, ooh pardon me

8003
04:37:46,920 --> 04:37:48,920
I'll get off my high horse

8004
04:37:48,920 --> 04:37:50,920
I think I may need to eat for I haven't eaten anything at all to do

8005
04:37:50,920 --> 04:37:52,920
in fact I've only had a cup of tea

8006
04:37:52,920 --> 04:37:54,920
and a half bottle of water

8007
04:37:54,920 --> 04:37:56,920
it's not looking good for me

8008
04:37:56,920 --> 04:37:58,920
so yes

8009
04:37:58,920 --> 04:38:00,920
I will do

8010
04:38:00,920 --> 04:38:02,920
another batch

8011
04:38:02,920 --> 04:38:04,920
so when strongies farm

8012
04:38:04,920 --> 04:38:06,920
airing on BBC

8013
04:38:06,920 --> 04:38:08,920
oh they'd never let me air it I'd be going nuts

8014
04:38:08,920 --> 04:38:10,920
yeah actually

8015
04:38:10,920 --> 04:38:12,920
we'll go back for it a little bit it's not too tin foil hat

8016
04:38:12,920 --> 04:38:14,920
during world war one and world war two

8017
04:38:14,920 --> 04:38:16,920
where food scarcity was a thing

8018
04:38:16,920 --> 04:38:18,920
in the modern day age food scarcity

8019
04:38:18,920 --> 04:38:20,920
is not a thing please do not be under the impression

8020
04:38:20,920 --> 04:38:22,920
scarcity is a lie

8021
04:38:22,920 --> 04:38:24,920
food

8022
04:38:24,920 --> 04:38:26,920
scarcity was a thing

8023
04:38:26,920 --> 04:38:28,920
so people were encouraged to grow

8024
04:38:28,920 --> 04:38:30,920
farms to do very unique

8025
04:38:30,920 --> 04:38:32,920
plots to do

8026
04:38:32,920 --> 04:38:34,920
legumes to do potatoes to do

8027
04:38:34,920 --> 04:38:36,920
the most staple foods you can imagine

8028
04:38:36,920 --> 04:38:38,920
and with the uprising

8029
04:38:38,920 --> 04:38:40,920
of supermarkets people stopped doing it

8030
04:38:40,920 --> 04:38:42,920
and who benefits

8031
04:38:42,920 --> 04:38:44,920
who benefits

8032
04:38:44,920 --> 04:38:46,920
when we

8033
04:38:46,920 --> 04:38:48,920
the individuals the small

8034
04:38:48,920 --> 04:38:50,920
communities no longer grow

8035
04:38:50,920 --> 04:38:52,920
our own crops no longer

8036
04:38:52,920 --> 04:38:54,920
have thingy

8037
04:38:54,920 --> 04:38:56,920
we are fully reliant

8038
04:38:56,920 --> 04:38:58,920
on the system

8039
04:38:58,920 --> 04:39:00,920
which is not good

8040
04:39:00,920 --> 04:39:02,920
you never want to fully rely on the system

8041
04:39:02,920 --> 04:39:04,920
but guess what if you don't want to

8042
04:39:04,920 --> 04:39:06,920
rely on the system what do you need

8043
04:39:06,920 --> 04:39:08,920
oh well you need a plot of land to grow

8044
04:39:08,920 --> 04:39:10,920
okay and you need time

8045
04:39:10,920 --> 04:39:12,920
but wait a minute even if I

8046
04:39:12,920 --> 04:39:14,920
fully outright buy my

8047
04:39:14,920 --> 04:39:16,920
plot of land wait a minute

8048
04:39:16,920 --> 04:39:18,920
I still have to play some

8049
04:39:18,920 --> 04:39:20,920
to pay some sort of yearly

8050
04:39:20,920 --> 04:39:22,920
land tax

8051
04:39:22,920 --> 04:39:24,920
towards

8052
04:39:24,920 --> 04:39:26,920
the place that I'm living in

8053
04:39:26,920 --> 04:39:28,920
because there is no place that is truly free

8054
04:39:28,920 --> 04:39:30,920
you can you buy

8055
04:39:30,920 --> 04:39:32,920
a house in UK and every year

8056
04:39:32,920 --> 04:39:34,920
you pay council tax

8057
04:39:34,920 --> 04:39:36,920
even if you don't participate in the services

8058
04:39:36,920 --> 04:39:38,920
that they provide

8059
04:39:38,920 --> 04:39:40,920
you do it in Australia they have a thing

8060
04:39:40,920 --> 04:39:42,920
called land tax in America

8061
04:39:42,920 --> 04:39:44,920
they have a thing called something tax

8062
04:39:44,920 --> 04:39:46,920
even when you

8063
04:39:46,920 --> 04:39:48,920
want to fully

8064
04:39:48,920 --> 04:39:50,920
no longer be a part of the system

8065
04:39:50,920 --> 04:39:52,920
they already got you

8066
04:39:52,920 --> 04:39:54,920
hook, line and sinker

8067
04:39:54,920 --> 04:39:56,920
and it doesn't matter what you do

8068
04:39:56,920 --> 04:39:58,920
you can't escape it anyway that's me

8069
04:39:58,920 --> 04:40:00,920
property ownership tax yet

8070
04:40:00,920 --> 04:40:02,920
farmers are struggling

8071
04:40:02,920 --> 04:40:04,920
yep so

8072
04:40:04,920 --> 04:40:06,920
em

8073
04:40:06,920 --> 04:40:08,920
every time

8074
04:40:08,920 --> 04:40:10,920
there is a shortage

8075
04:40:12,920 --> 04:40:14,920
in Australia recently

8076
04:40:14,920 --> 04:40:16,920
this happened a couple of months back now though

8077
04:40:16,920 --> 04:40:18,920
there was a shortages of eggs

8078
04:40:18,920 --> 04:40:20,920
and the prices went up

8079
04:40:20,920 --> 04:40:22,920
because there was a shortage of course that makes sense

8080
04:40:22,920 --> 04:40:24,920
so more people are wanting eggs

8081
04:40:24,920 --> 04:40:26,920
but there's less eggs ah hold on a minute

8082
04:40:26,920 --> 04:40:28,920
what's going on here we're in the information age

8083
04:40:28,920 --> 04:40:30,920
a major

8084
04:40:30,920 --> 04:40:32,920
em

8085
04:40:32,920 --> 04:40:34,920
a major

8086
04:40:34,920 --> 04:40:36,920
major egg producer

8087
04:40:36,920 --> 04:40:38,920
in Australia came out and said

8088
04:40:38,920 --> 04:40:40,920
em actually

8089
04:40:40,920 --> 04:40:42,920
there's nothing wrong with production at all

8090
04:40:42,920 --> 04:40:44,920
if you want to know the truth

8091
04:40:44,920 --> 04:40:46,920
they're actually not giving us

8092
04:40:46,920 --> 04:40:48,920
as much money as they used to

8093
04:40:48,920 --> 04:40:50,920
yet the prices are going up

8094
04:40:50,920 --> 04:40:52,920
and we don't get to see any of that benefit

8095
04:40:52,920 --> 04:40:54,920
are you telling me

8096
04:40:54,920 --> 04:40:56,920
these mega corporations

8097
04:40:56,920 --> 04:40:58,920
are artificially

8098
04:40:58,920 --> 04:41:00,920
hold on

8099
04:41:00,920 --> 04:41:02,920
are you telling me

8100
04:41:02,920 --> 04:41:04,920
these mega corporations

8101
04:41:04,920 --> 04:41:06,920
wait how is there two

8102
04:41:06,920 --> 04:41:08,920
how did I do that hold on a minute

8103
04:41:08,920 --> 04:41:10,920
I need to put my tinfoil hat back on

8104
04:41:10,920 --> 04:41:12,920
no

8105
04:41:12,920 --> 04:41:14,920
it can't be

8106
04:41:14,920 --> 04:41:16,920
that all these mega corporations

8107
04:41:16,920 --> 04:41:18,920
are actually hand in hand with one another

8108
04:41:18,920 --> 04:41:20,920
no

8109
04:41:20,920 --> 04:41:22,920
wait

8110
04:41:22,920 --> 04:41:24,920
the cost of living crisis

8111
04:41:24,920 --> 04:41:26,920
is actually artificial

8112
04:41:26,920 --> 04:41:28,920
because if one shop

8113
04:41:28,920 --> 04:41:30,920
raises their prices

8114
04:41:30,920 --> 04:41:32,920
the other shop can justify that

8115
04:41:32,920 --> 04:41:34,920
but then the major

8116
04:41:34,920 --> 04:41:36,920
no that can't be right because

8117
04:41:36,920 --> 04:41:38,920
capitalism obviously

8118
04:41:38,920 --> 04:41:40,920
what the frick is that

8119
04:41:40,920 --> 04:41:42,920
that's very grand sitting on that table

8120
04:41:42,920 --> 04:41:44,920
but then oh no that can't be right

8121
04:41:44,920 --> 04:41:46,920
no

8122
04:41:46,920 --> 04:41:48,920
the good businesses aren't

8123
04:41:48,920 --> 04:41:50,920
wait a minute

8124
04:41:50,920 --> 04:41:52,920
Coca Cola owns

8125
04:41:52,920 --> 04:41:54,920
all of the market

8126
04:41:54,920 --> 04:41:56,920
wait

8127
04:41:56,920 --> 04:41:58,920
but I thought capitalism

8128
04:41:58,920 --> 04:42:00,920
bred competition

8129
04:42:00,920 --> 04:42:02,920
no no everything I've been told

8130
04:42:02,920 --> 04:42:04,920
that's not right

8131
04:42:04,920 --> 04:42:06,920
wait a minute

8132
04:42:06,920 --> 04:42:08,920
something's not adding up

8133
04:42:08,920 --> 04:42:10,920
Coca Cola seems to own

8134
04:42:10,920 --> 04:42:12,920
literally everything

8135
04:42:12,920 --> 04:42:14,920
wait a minute who is the sole business owner

8136
04:42:14,920 --> 04:42:16,920
because everything seems

8137
04:42:16,920 --> 04:42:18,920
to be getting acquired

8138
04:42:18,920 --> 04:42:20,920
wait

8139
04:42:20,920 --> 04:42:22,920
wait a minute it's a conglomerate

8140
04:42:22,920 --> 04:42:24,920
everything is a

8141
04:42:24,920 --> 04:42:26,920
fucking conglomerate

8142
04:42:26,920 --> 04:42:28,920
and they can put up the prices as much as they please

8143
04:42:28,920 --> 04:42:30,920
because there's no true

8144
04:42:30,920 --> 04:42:32,920
competition

8145
04:42:32,920 --> 04:42:34,920
even if there were cheaper

8146
04:42:34,920 --> 04:42:36,920
brands that wanted to get on the shelves

8147
04:42:36,920 --> 04:42:38,920
brands have to pay

8148
04:42:38,920 --> 04:42:40,920
to be on the shelves in your common

8149
04:42:40,920 --> 04:42:42,920
supermarkets

8150
04:42:42,920 --> 04:42:44,920
holy moly

8151
04:42:44,920 --> 04:42:46,920
my head

8152
04:42:46,920 --> 04:42:48,920
spinning just thinking about

8153
04:42:48,920 --> 04:42:50,920
how deep this rabbit hole goes

8154
04:42:50,920 --> 04:42:52,920
maybe

8155
04:42:52,920 --> 04:42:54,920
we should focus on the one rabbit hole

8156
04:42:54,920 --> 04:42:56,920
that's important to us

8157
04:42:56,920 --> 04:42:58,920
and that's Sheeby's hole

8158
04:42:58,920 --> 04:43:00,920
we love you Sheeby we hope you feel better

8159
04:43:00,920 --> 04:43:02,920
after your migraine

8160
04:43:02,920 --> 04:43:04,920
what a way to end that

8161
04:43:04,920 --> 04:43:06,920
okay okay I'll take the hat off

8162
04:43:06,920 --> 04:43:08,920
I'll take the hat off

8163
04:43:08,920 --> 04:43:10,920

8238
04:52:08,920 --> 04:52:10,920
thank you for the tip boy

8239
04:52:10,920 --> 04:52:12,920
um

8240
04:52:12,920 --> 04:52:14,920
no I will

8241
04:52:14,920 --> 04:52:16,920
I think I have got my mesh

8242
04:52:16,920 --> 04:52:18,920
is back

8243
04:52:18,920 --> 04:52:20,920
I will um

8244
04:52:20,920 --> 04:52:22,920
I will refrain from any more tin foil

8245
04:52:22,920 --> 04:52:24,920
and unless you guys get me started again

8246
04:52:24,920 --> 04:52:26,920
then I just can't help myself

8247
04:52:28,920 --> 04:52:30,920
I have a can of cola

8248
04:52:32,920 --> 04:52:34,920
I have a honey tea which I need some help

8249
04:52:34,920 --> 04:52:36,920
the reeflings with

8250
04:52:36,920 --> 04:52:38,920
I have a neutral green bar

8251
04:52:38,920 --> 04:52:40,920
a nature valley crunch bar

8252
04:52:40,920 --> 04:52:42,920
and a blueberry muffin

8253
04:52:42,920 --> 04:52:44,920
I can't really make it make a noise I can smack the bottom

8254
04:52:44,920 --> 04:52:46,920
of the casing

8255
04:52:46,920 --> 04:52:48,920
I don't know if you can hear that

8256
04:52:48,920 --> 04:52:50,920
um

8257
04:52:50,920 --> 04:52:52,920
but that is pretty much

8258
04:52:52,920 --> 04:52:54,920
what's going on

8259
04:52:58,920 --> 04:53:00,920
I really remember

8260
04:53:00,920 --> 04:53:02,920
moving to my head to express

8261
04:53:03,920 --> 04:53:05,920
she came back she loves this

8262
04:53:05,920 --> 04:53:07,920
of course I do

8263
04:53:07,920 --> 04:53:09,920
remember that time I thought I wasn't going to come back

8264
04:53:09,920 --> 04:53:11,920
that was rough

8265
04:53:11,920 --> 04:53:13,920
that was rough and then I come back

8266
04:53:13,920 --> 04:53:15,920
come back even stronger

8267
04:53:15,920 --> 04:53:17,920
yes I

8268
04:53:17,920 --> 04:53:19,920
for endurance streams

8269
04:53:19,920 --> 04:53:21,920
it's not possible

8270
04:53:21,920 --> 04:53:23,920
for me to prepare food

8271
04:53:24,920 --> 04:53:26,920
unless I did it in advance but I am a lazy fud

8272
04:53:26,920 --> 04:53:28,920
um so

8273
04:53:28,920 --> 04:53:30,920
I have bought like a load of

8274
04:53:30,920 --> 04:53:32,920
drive food or food that

8275
04:53:32,920 --> 04:53:34,920
is zero prep time

8276
04:53:34,920 --> 04:53:36,920
I don't have any boiled eggs

8277
04:53:36,920 --> 04:53:38,920
I ate all my boiled eggs

8278
04:53:38,920 --> 04:53:40,920
and my meat sticks have kind of

8279
04:53:40,920 --> 04:53:42,920
overstayed their welcome

8280
04:53:42,920 --> 04:53:44,920
no no no no no no

8281
04:53:44,920 --> 04:53:46,920
I am going to take a bite of my muffin though

8282
04:53:46,920 --> 04:53:48,920
I did not realise

8283
04:53:48,920 --> 04:53:50,920
I had been streaming for five hours

8284
04:53:50,920 --> 04:53:52,920
I literally had nothing but a cup of tea

8285
04:53:52,920 --> 04:53:54,920
and a half bottle of water that's outrageous

8286
04:53:54,920 --> 04:53:56,920
that's how distracted you guys get me

8287
04:53:56,920 --> 04:53:58,920
that's how much I freaking love it

8288
04:53:58,920 --> 04:54:00,920
um

8289
04:54:00,920 --> 04:54:02,920
oh my goodness but yes

8290
04:54:02,920 --> 04:54:04,920
I am going to take a bite of my muffin

8291
04:54:04,920 --> 04:54:06,920
I do apologise if I am not

8292
04:54:06,920 --> 04:54:08,920
talking for a few moments

8293
04:54:08,920 --> 04:54:10,920
but I eat my muffin

8294
04:54:10,920 --> 04:54:12,920
itadakimasu

8295
04:54:16,920 --> 04:54:18,920
oh my goodness

8296
04:54:20,920 --> 04:54:22,920
it's nice and jelly

8297
04:54:22,920 --> 04:54:24,920
oh yeah we distract you

8298
04:54:24,920 --> 04:54:26,920
yeah

8299
04:54:26,920 --> 04:54:28,920
I can't believe it

8300
04:54:28,920 --> 04:54:30,920
I can't believe

8301
04:54:30,920 --> 04:54:32,920
we really enjoy each other's company

8302
04:54:32,920 --> 04:54:34,920
it's crazy it's a crazy concept

8303
04:54:34,920 --> 04:54:36,920
honestly couldn't imagine being a VTuber

8304
04:54:36,920 --> 04:54:38,920
that hates our audience like bro

8305
04:54:40,920 --> 04:54:42,920
why are you even streaming

8306
04:54:42,920 --> 04:54:44,920
cause I am pretty sure I have heard a few

8307
04:54:44,920 --> 04:54:46,920
sent stories like that

8308
04:54:46,920 --> 04:54:48,920
where they are like oh I hate what I do

8309
04:54:48,920 --> 04:54:50,920
I am like what if you hate what you do

8310
04:54:50,920 --> 04:54:52,920
like

8311
04:54:52,920 --> 04:54:54,920
go clock out and do something else

8312
04:54:54,920 --> 04:54:56,920
what the fuck

8313
04:54:56,920 --> 04:54:58,920
how can you not enjoy your time

8314
04:54:58,920 --> 04:55:00,920
actually

8315
04:55:00,920 --> 04:55:02,920
well I am on my high horse about VTubers now

8316
04:55:02,920 --> 04:55:04,920
how can you not enjoy your time

8317
04:55:04,920 --> 04:55:06,920
you dictated everything you get to do

8318
04:55:06,920 --> 04:55:08,920
you don't have to do a single thing

8319
04:55:08,920 --> 04:55:10,920
if you want to play game play game

8320
04:55:10,920 --> 04:55:12,920
if you don't want to play game don't play game

8321
04:55:12,920 --> 04:55:14,920
you want to zazoo zazoo

8322
04:55:14,920 --> 04:55:16,920
you don't want to zazoo don't zazoo

8323
04:55:16,920 --> 04:55:18,920
wait a minute what's going on

8324
04:55:18,920 --> 04:55:20,920
nah I refuse to believe there is any VTubers that stream

8325
04:55:20,920 --> 04:55:22,920
that actually don't like streaming

8326
04:55:22,920 --> 04:55:24,920
they don't like everything

8327
04:55:24,920 --> 04:55:26,920
it doesn't make sense

8328
04:55:26,920 --> 04:55:28,920
the Elden Ring

8329
04:55:28,920 --> 04:55:30,920
DLC comes out

8330
04:55:30,920 --> 04:55:32,920
and I get to do nothing

8331
04:55:32,920 --> 04:55:34,920
but play with you guys

8332
04:55:34,920 --> 04:55:36,920
for again what half a week

8333
04:55:36,920 --> 04:55:38,920
maybe more actually maybe 5 sessions

8334
04:55:38,920 --> 04:55:40,920
I have no idea how big the DLC is

8335
04:55:40,920 --> 04:55:42,920
I don't even know

8336
04:55:42,920 --> 04:55:44,920
if they have given an indication on how big

8337
04:55:44,920 --> 04:55:46,920
the DLC is

8338
04:55:48,920 --> 04:55:50,920
I just want money for existing proof

8339
04:55:50,920 --> 04:55:52,920
and another thing about capital

8340
04:55:52,920 --> 04:55:54,920
I'll stop

8341
04:55:54,920 --> 04:55:56,920
no more hi-hat

8342
04:55:56,920 --> 04:55:58,920
no more tinfoil for now

8343
04:55:58,920 --> 04:56:00,920
I will burn you out on my conspiracy theories

8344
04:56:00,920 --> 04:56:02,920
T-

8345
04:56:02,920 --> 04:56:04,920
1 hour I believe

8346
04:56:04,920 --> 04:56:06,920
for our lovely

8347
04:56:08,920 --> 04:56:10,920
the goddess

8348
04:56:10,920 --> 04:56:12,920
of fertility

8349
04:56:12,920 --> 04:56:14,920
or mummy

8350
04:56:14,920 --> 04:56:16,920
she is your mummy canonically

8351
04:56:16,920 --> 04:56:18,920
she is quite literally your mum

8352
04:56:20,920 --> 04:56:22,920
nah

8353
04:56:22,920 --> 04:56:24,920
it was enough to be nearly a full game

8354
04:56:24,920 --> 04:56:26,920
ok might need to change up my plan

8355
04:56:26,920 --> 04:56:28,920
for the 4th week

8356
04:56:28,920 --> 04:56:30,920
do you want to hold it strongy

8357
04:56:30,920 --> 04:56:32,920
the DLC

8358
04:56:32,920 --> 04:56:34,920
I want to stack donuts on it

8359
04:56:34,920 --> 04:56:36,920
ok if it's like

8360
04:56:36,920 --> 04:56:38,920
wait are we going to do a full week of Elden Ring then

8361
04:56:42,920 --> 04:56:44,920
if we do a full week of Elden Ring

8362
04:56:44,920 --> 04:56:46,920
on the 4th week

8363
04:56:46,920 --> 04:56:48,920

8373
04:57:06,920 --> 04:57:08,920
stack donuts

8374
04:57:08,920 --> 04:57:10,920
villager minecraft note

8375
04:57:10,920 --> 04:57:12,920
Elden Ring DLC I sleep

8379
04:57:18,920 --> 04:57:20,920

it's called

8381
04:57:22,920 --> 04:57:24,920
Boutro

8382
04:57:24,920 --> 04:57:26,920
it is a poker

8383
04:57:26,920 --> 04:57:28,920
type game

8384
04:57:28,920 --> 04:57:30,920
and unfortunately

8385
04:57:30,920 --> 04:57:32,920
I'm not very familiar with the old

8386
04:57:32,920 --> 04:57:34,920
straight flush flush royal flush

8387
04:57:34,920 --> 04:57:36,920
or whatever the only flush I do

8388
04:57:36,920 --> 04:57:38,920
is after I drop a big job in the toilet

8389
04:57:38,920 --> 04:57:40,920
and

8390
04:57:40,920 --> 04:57:42,920
I was

8391
04:57:42,920 --> 04:57:44,920
it looks pretty easy to play

8392
04:57:44,920 --> 04:57:46,920
in terms of me actually being good

8393
04:57:46,920 --> 04:57:48,920
that's a different story however

8394
04:57:48,920 --> 04:57:50,920
it looked like a can

8395
04:57:50,920 --> 04:57:52,920
to our game experience

8396
04:57:52,920 --> 04:57:54,920
so I was doing my research

8397
04:57:54,920 --> 04:57:56,920
I was watching people play it and I'm like

8398
04:57:56,920 --> 04:57:58,920
hmm yes I understand none of this

8399
04:57:58,920 --> 04:58:00,920
so I'm going to look at a few more tutorials

8400
04:58:00,920 --> 04:58:02,920
but we might give Boutro a little try

8401
04:58:02,920 --> 04:58:04,920
I'll be one of my shorter streams

8402
04:58:04,920 --> 04:58:06,920
hmm

8403
04:58:06,920 --> 04:58:08,920
not the new tinkle

8404
04:58:08,920 --> 04:58:10,920
the guys whenever you

8405
04:58:10,920 --> 04:58:12,920
poop do you always pee as well

8406
04:58:14,920 --> 04:58:16,920
I think it's the same for guys

8407
04:58:16,920 --> 04:58:18,920
I do know a secret though

8408
04:58:18,920 --> 04:58:20,920
if you move your fireman's

8409
04:58:20,920 --> 04:58:22,920
hose

8410
04:58:22,920 --> 04:58:24,920
your butthole clenches

8411
04:58:24,920 --> 04:58:26,920
I've never been the same

8412
04:58:26,920 --> 04:58:28,920
since I learned that fact on the internet

8413
04:58:28,920 --> 04:58:30,920
the internet has scarred me for that fact

8414
04:58:30,920 --> 04:58:32,920
it's there

8415
04:58:32,920 --> 04:58:34,920
see you're all twitching

8416
04:58:34,920 --> 04:58:36,920
your buttholes right now I can tell

8417
04:58:36,920 --> 04:58:38,920
reeflings

8418
04:58:38,920 --> 04:58:40,920
can't believe you're doing it in unison

8419
04:58:40,920 --> 04:58:42,920
okay

8420
04:58:42,920 --> 04:58:44,920
I have finished

8421
04:58:44,920 --> 04:58:46,920
my mini muffin

8422
04:58:46,920 --> 04:58:48,920
I'm going to open up my cola

8423
04:58:48,920 --> 04:58:50,920
to wash it down

8424
04:58:50,920 --> 04:58:52,920
hmm

8425
04:58:52,920 --> 04:58:54,920
honestly I was worried about eating on stream

8426
04:58:54,920 --> 04:58:56,920
but it's really easy to eat and play runeski

8427
04:58:56,920 --> 04:58:58,920
at the same time

8428
04:58:58,920 --> 04:59:00,920
a twitch butthole for a moment

8429
04:59:00,920 --> 04:59:02,920
reeflings together

8430
04:59:02,920 --> 04:59:04,920
strong

8431
04:59:04,920 --> 04:59:06,920
we can also manually twitch your fireman's hose

8432
04:59:06,920 --> 04:59:08,920
but can you do it without

8433
04:59:08,920 --> 04:59:10,920
twitching the butthole

8434
04:59:10,920 --> 04:59:12,920
no you can't apparently it's guys

8435
04:59:12,920 --> 04:59:14,920
biology that you can't

8436
04:59:22,920 --> 04:59:24,920
wah

8437
04:59:24,920 --> 04:59:26,920
bit cola

8438
04:59:26,920 --> 04:59:28,920
man by the pope

8439
04:59:28,920 --> 04:59:30,920
wait wait wait hold on a minute who's calling me hypocritical

8440
04:59:30,920 --> 04:59:32,920
cause I just talked about corporations

8441
04:59:32,920 --> 04:59:34,920
and then I'm currently eating and drinking cola

8442
04:59:34,920 --> 04:59:36,920
me

8443
04:59:36,920 --> 04:59:38,920
as if I can source this stuff myself in the wild

8444
04:59:40,920 --> 04:59:42,920
who else is going to give me my sugary nectar

8445
04:59:46,920 --> 04:59:48,920
I'm currently open my nature valley

8446
04:59:48,920 --> 04:59:50,920
I have a bowl to eat it in

8447
04:59:50,920 --> 04:59:52,920
because I just know it's going to go

8448
04:59:52,920 --> 04:59:54,920
everywhere

8449
04:59:54,920 --> 04:59:56,920
and

8450
04:59:56,920 --> 04:59:58,920
we're almost at a million eggs

8451
04:59:58,920 --> 05:00:00,920
wah

8452
05:00:02,920 --> 05:00:04,920
look

8453
05:00:04,920 --> 05:00:06,920
7,000

8454
05:00:10,920 --> 05:00:12,920
tea

8455
05:00:12,920 --> 05:00:14,920
did you just snipe that

8456
05:00:14,920 --> 05:00:16,920
I think he just sniped that little thing there

8457
05:00:18,920 --> 05:00:20,920
I'd like to check out mommy's nature valley

8458
05:00:20,920 --> 05:00:22,920
I thought a certain type of

8459
05:00:22,920 --> 05:00:24,920
exercise could give you that kind of

8460
05:00:24,920 --> 05:00:26,920
control over the muscles

8461
05:00:26,920 --> 05:00:28,920
do you guys want to do kegels together

8462
05:00:28,920 --> 05:00:30,920
and hold

8463
05:00:30,920 --> 05:00:32,920
2, 3 and release

8464
05:00:32,920 --> 05:00:34,920
2, 3 and hold 2, 3

8465
05:00:34,920 --> 05:00:36,920
that's terrible

8466
05:00:36,920 --> 05:00:38,920
don't encourage me

8467
05:00:38,920 --> 05:00:40,920
don't get me started

8468
05:00:40,920 --> 05:00:42,920
not only will we have

8469
05:00:42,920 --> 05:00:44,920
oh my god I'm trying to take the nature valley out

8470
05:00:44,920 --> 05:00:46,920
without it crumbling everywhere

8471
05:00:46,920 --> 05:00:48,920
I have a Canadian

8472
05:00:48,920 --> 05:00:50,920
maple syrup flavor

8473
05:00:50,920 --> 05:00:52,920
at nature valley

8474
05:00:52,920 --> 05:00:54,920
I got a box that has like 3 different flavors inside

8475
05:00:54,920 --> 05:00:56,920
and I just grabbed one

8476
05:00:56,920 --> 05:00:58,920
because I had to tinkle and it just

8477
05:00:58,920 --> 05:01:00,920
whoa wait how fast is that spawn

8478
05:01:02,920 --> 05:01:04,920
mmm

8479
05:01:04,920 --> 05:01:06,920
oh god

8480
05:01:12,920 --> 05:01:14,920
I'm sorry if we got my eating time

8481
05:01:18,920 --> 05:01:20,920
I'm off to buy groceries

8482
05:01:20,920 --> 05:01:22,920
enjoy the shop

8483
05:01:22,920 --> 05:01:24,920

05:01:26,920 --> 05:01:28,920
smile

8486
05:01:28,920 --> 05:01:30,920
whoa that like

8487
05:01:30,920 --> 05:01:32,920
respawn so fast that's 30k

8488
05:01:32,920 --> 05:01:34,920
every second

8489
05:01:34,920 --> 05:01:36,920
wah

8490
05:01:38,920 --> 05:01:40,920
mmm am I going crazy

8491
05:01:40,920 --> 05:01:42,920
why is that spawning so fast

8492
05:01:42,920 --> 05:01:44,920
is it like an event or something

8493
05:01:44,920 --> 05:01:46,920
mommy stir it

8494
05:01:46,920 --> 05:01:48,920
she doesn't need a lips of 22 million

8495
05:01:48,920 --> 05:01:50,920
and I'm like oh my god is that 30k

8496
05:01:50,920 --> 05:01:52,920
that's amazing

8497
05:01:52,920 --> 05:01:54,920
mmm

8498
05:01:54,920 --> 05:01:56,920
yes I'm enjoying

8499
05:01:56,920 --> 05:01:58,920
is Gimli still fine

8500
05:01:58,920 --> 05:02:00,920
no she's asleep

8501
05:02:00,920 --> 05:02:02,920
I have to sneak around her

8502
05:02:02,920 --> 05:02:04,920
mmm

8503
05:02:04,920 --> 05:02:06,920
what was that oh no it wasn't me that leveled up

8504
05:02:06,920 --> 05:02:08,920
I take another big bite

8505
05:02:08,920 --> 05:02:10,920
wah

8506
05:02:10,920 --> 05:02:12,920
wah

8507
05:02:12,920 --> 05:02:14,920
mmm

8508
05:02:14,920 --> 05:02:16,920
bye bye

8509
05:02:16,920 --> 05:02:18,920
don't worry if you have to go

8510
05:02:18,920 --> 05:02:20,920
this is an endurance stream

8511
05:02:20,920 --> 05:02:22,920
I did not expect anyone to sit for 12 hours

8512
05:02:22,920 --> 05:02:24,920
with me on RuneScape alone

8513
05:02:28,920 --> 05:02:30,920
someone's dropping them

8514
05:02:30,920 --> 05:02:32,920
why would they do that

8515
05:02:32,920 --> 05:02:34,920
how rather odd

8516
05:02:38,920 --> 05:02:40,920
is he just giving them away

8517
05:02:42,920 --> 05:02:44,920
but what if we wanted to

8518
05:02:44,920 --> 05:02:46,920
am we not supposed to

8519
05:02:54,920 --> 05:02:56,920
how bizarre

8520
05:03:00,920 --> 05:03:02,920
I think it may be bad for your health

8521
05:03:02,920 --> 05:03:04,920
to watch me for 12 hours

8522
05:03:04,920 --> 05:03:06,920
I'm going to be gone now

8523
05:03:06,920 --> 05:03:08,920
70

8524
05:03:08,920 --> 05:03:10,920
oh my god we hit 70

8525
05:03:10,920 --> 05:03:12,920
we're only

8526
05:03:12,920 --> 05:03:14,920
just over the 5 hour mark

8527
05:03:14,920 --> 05:03:16,920
can we do 80

8528
05:03:16,920 --> 05:03:18,920
is that too much of a reach

8529
05:03:18,920 --> 05:03:20,920
to do 80

8530
05:03:32,920 --> 05:03:34,920
this shit fucking

8531
05:03:34,920 --> 05:03:36,920

05:03:36,920 --> 05:03:38,920
nature valley counting your days

8533
05:03:38,920 --> 05:03:40,920
that's outrageously

8534
05:03:40,920 --> 05:03:42,920
crumbly

8535
05:03:46,920 --> 05:03:48,920
chat summary shocked you

8536
05:03:48,920 --> 05:03:50,920

05:04:04,920 --> 05:04:06,920
it's too many to choose from

8540
05:04:06,920 --> 05:04:08,920
from 70 to 76

8541
05:04:10,920 --> 05:04:12,920
good 6am

8542
05:04:12,920 --> 05:04:14,920

8550
05:04:32,920 --> 05:04:34,920
I was not going to let you post it

8551
05:04:34,920 --> 05:04:36,920
because I'm strumming

8552
05:04:36,920 --> 05:04:38,920
I'm strumming my badge

8553
05:04:48,920 --> 05:04:50,920
I haven't played whole night

8554
05:04:50,920 --> 05:04:52,920

05:05:22,920 --> 05:05:24,920

05:05:42,920 --> 05:05:44,920

8576
05:05:54,920 --> 05:05:56,920

you know who I like what pokemon I like

8580
05:06:04,920 --> 05:06:06,920

8581
05:06:08,920 --> 05:06:10,920
sorry that was so off topic

8582
05:06:10,920 --> 05:06:12,920
yeah so there's this pokemon

8583
05:06:12,920 --> 05:06:14,920
called Qing Ling

8584
05:06:14,920 --> 05:06:16,920

8585
05:06:16,920 --> 05:06:18,920
and I'm like bruv

8586
05:06:18,920 --> 05:06:20,920
it's ridiculous

8587
05:06:26,920 --> 05:06:28,920
but it's a cute pokemon I like the way it looks

8588
05:06:28,920 --> 05:06:30,920
it's really adorable

8589
05:06:30,920 --> 05:06:32,920

8592
05:06:36,920 --> 05:06:38,920
I'm not sure how I feel about that

8593
05:06:38,920 --> 05:06:40,920
17.9 burn rate

8594
05:06:40,920 --> 05:06:42,920
oh it has gone down

8595
05:06:42,920 --> 05:06:44,920
only tism havers here

8596
05:06:44,920 --> 05:06:46,920
we only have tism around these parts

8597
05:06:46,920 --> 05:06:48,920
we don't have them function in brains

8598
05:06:48,920 --> 05:06:50,920
hmm

8599
05:06:56,920 --> 05:06:58,920
Qing Ling is the sound it makes

8600
05:06:58,920 --> 05:07:00,920
what are you saying

8601
05:07:02,920 --> 05:07:04,920
sounds like a

8602
05:07:04,920 --> 05:07:06,920
a weird name

8603
05:07:06,920 --> 05:07:08,920
my favorite pokemon is mega

8604
05:07:08,920 --> 05:07:10,920

Aaron

8608
05:07:18,920 --> 05:07:20,920
the wee iron guy

8609
05:07:20,920 --> 05:07:22,920

8610
05:07:22,920 --> 05:07:24,920
and he eats iron

8611
05:07:24,920 --> 05:07:26,920
he's so cute

8612
05:07:26,920 --> 05:07:28,920

8614
05:07:30,920 --> 05:07:32,920
penicillin

8618
05:07:40,920 --> 05:07:42,920
I'm getting distracted

8619
05:07:42,920 --> 05:07:44,920
I'm not mega

8620
05:07:44,920 --> 05:07:46,920
I'm missing all my swordy fishies

8621
05:07:46,920 --> 05:07:48,920
I definitely am going to finish

8622
05:07:48,920 --> 05:07:50,920
all the swordfishes though

8623
05:07:50,920 --> 05:07:52,920
which is amazing

8624
05:07:52,920 --> 05:07:54,920
I'll need to go buy something

8625
05:07:54,920 --> 05:07:56,920
at the grand exchange

8626
05:07:56,920 --> 05:07:58,920
sorry if you heard my stomach rumble there

8627
05:07:58,920 --> 05:08:00,920
illichid an internal far

8628
05:08:00,920 --> 05:08:02,920
those plate bodies are getting suspiciously close

8629
05:08:02,920 --> 05:08:04,920
to us now

8630
05:08:04,920 --> 05:08:06,920

8631
05:08:06,920 --> 05:08:08,920
exp wastage

8632
05:08:08,920 --> 05:08:10,920

8634
05:08:12,920 --> 05:08:14,920
I remember when pokemon go came out

8635
05:08:14,920 --> 05:08:16,920
I was really digging it

8636
05:08:18,920 --> 05:08:20,920

you know

8639
05:08:24,920 --> 05:08:26,920
I can't remember what it's called but that's like english culture

8640
05:08:26,920 --> 05:08:28,920
when you stand around a pole and all dance around it

8641
05:08:28,920 --> 05:08:30,920
that sounded like another type of

8642
05:08:30,920 --> 05:08:32,920
dance but no

8643
05:08:32,920 --> 05:08:34,920
it's like actually english culture

8644
05:08:34,920 --> 05:08:36,920
like back in the old days

8645
05:08:36,920 --> 05:08:38,920
like that

8646
05:08:38,920 --> 05:08:40,920

05:10:24,920 --> 05:10:26,920
I'm just a streamer

8697
05:10:26,920 --> 05:10:28,920
I stream my life

8698
05:10:28,920 --> 05:10:30,920

8704
05:10:42,920 --> 05:10:44,920

8705
05:10:46,920 --> 05:10:48,920
68

8706
05:10:48,920 --> 05:10:50,920
16 points oh the burn rate went up

8707
05:10:50,920 --> 05:10:52,920
I got a little too excited hold on a minute

8708
05:10:52,920 --> 05:10:54,920
oh I think it's because it's reset the burn rate will

8709
05:10:54,920 --> 05:10:56,920
kind of go up until

8710
05:10:56,920 --> 05:10:58,920
maybe so you're under arrest

8711
05:10:58,920 --> 05:11:00,920
that guy said the NPC says

8712
05:11:00,920 --> 05:11:02,920
I'm focused on the

8713
05:11:02,920 --> 05:11:04,920
grind you don't want me to grind

8714
05:11:04,920 --> 05:11:06,920

05:11:10,920 --> 05:11:12,920
why would Emmy be under arrest

8716
05:11:12,920 --> 05:11:14,920
it should be pin pals under arrest

8717
05:11:22,920 --> 05:11:24,920
I'm not really enjoying

8718
05:11:24,920 --> 05:11:26,920
this bar anymore

8719
05:11:26,920 --> 05:11:28,920
rather flavorless

8720
05:11:28,920 --> 05:11:30,920
isn't it bro?

8721
05:11:30,920 --> 05:11:32,920
I'm tempted to order

8722
05:11:32,920 --> 05:11:34,920
take away I'm gonna be honest

8723
05:11:34,920 --> 05:11:36,920
I'm like

8724
05:11:36,920 --> 05:11:38,920
I'm doing an endurance stream

8725
05:11:38,920 --> 05:11:40,920
I deserve a cheeky take away

8726
05:11:40,920 --> 05:11:42,920
I'm such a good girl

8727
05:11:44,920 --> 05:11:46,920
pizza nah

8728
05:11:46,920 --> 05:11:48,920
not pizza

8729
05:11:48,920 --> 05:11:50,920
Australian pizza I'm sorry

8730
05:11:50,920 --> 05:11:52,920
Australia and any Australian

8731
05:11:52,920 --> 05:11:54,920
listening

8732
05:11:54,920 --> 05:11:56,920
Australian pizza is no thank you

8733
05:11:56,920 --> 05:11:58,920
I've not had one pizza I've enjoyed here

8734
05:11:58,920 --> 05:12:00,920
I just fill a grease

8735
05:12:00,920 --> 05:12:02,920
and like the grease is like

8736
05:12:02,920 --> 05:12:04,920
dripping off the thing

8737
05:12:04,920 --> 05:12:06,920
they could have like blotted it

8738
05:12:06,920 --> 05:12:08,920
or patted it or whatever but they don't

8739
05:12:10,920 --> 05:12:12,920
a cheeky little treat perhaps

8740
05:12:12,920 --> 05:12:14,920
I'm bringing you all with me

8741
05:12:14,920 --> 05:12:16,920
as I buy a pizza before a storm hits

8742
05:12:16,920 --> 05:12:18,920
oh you're actually getting a pizza in real life

8743
05:12:18,920 --> 05:12:20,920
okay okay

8744
05:12:22,920 --> 05:12:24,920
didn't Emmy burn down buildings

8745
05:12:24,920 --> 05:12:26,920
look Emmy needs

8746
05:12:26,920 --> 05:12:28,920
XP in order to summon her brother

8747
05:12:28,920 --> 05:12:30,920
back it's look whatever she does

8748
05:12:30,920 --> 05:12:32,920
as long as we can look the other way

8749
05:12:32,920 --> 05:12:34,920
the fact she's not actually now that I mentioned

8750
05:12:34,920 --> 05:12:36,920
the fact she's not even in jail

8751
05:12:36,920 --> 05:12:38,920
how would she be evading jail

8752
05:12:38,920 --> 05:12:40,920
when she just used her magic on people

8753
05:12:40,920 --> 05:12:42,920
who'd try and stop her

8754
05:12:42,920 --> 05:12:44,920
or maybe she has like influential magic

8755
05:12:44,920 --> 05:12:46,920
I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised

8756
05:12:46,920 --> 05:12:48,920
if she had like turned the other eye type

8757
05:12:48,920 --> 05:12:50,920
of spells and

8758
05:12:50,920 --> 05:12:52,920
where it was like oh must have been the wind

8759
05:12:52,920 --> 05:12:54,920
and I wouldn't be surprised

8760
05:12:54,920 --> 05:12:56,920
if she had access to that

8761
05:12:56,920 --> 05:12:58,920
and her wee totems

8762
05:13:02,920 --> 05:13:04,920
high charisma, yeah

8763
05:13:06,920 --> 05:13:08,920
she has to rescue Nissan from the devil

8764
05:13:08,920 --> 05:13:10,920
herself

8765
05:13:10,920 --> 05:13:12,920
like Maggie Thatcher

8766
05:13:12,920 --> 05:13:14,920
I think people were so confused

8767
05:13:14,920 --> 05:13:16,920
they were like why the devil herself

8768
05:13:16,920 --> 05:13:18,920
and then Maggie Thatcher and as a surprise

8769
05:13:18,920 --> 05:13:20,920
there was a Scottish person

8770
05:13:20,920 --> 05:13:22,920
on the development team and we thought the gag

8771
05:13:22,920 --> 05:13:24,920
was hilarious so

8772
05:13:24,920 --> 05:13:26,920
there you go

8773
05:13:28,920 --> 05:13:30,920
wow

8774
05:13:30,920 --> 05:13:32,920
I drank a wee bit of cola and then we're gonna get on

8775
05:13:32,920 --> 05:13:34,920
my honey tea

8776
05:13:34,920 --> 05:13:36,920
any honey tears

8777
05:13:38,920 --> 05:13:40,920
I'm honey tea

8778
05:13:42,920 --> 05:13:44,920
and we can just be a

8779
05:13:44,920 --> 05:13:46,920
peeler on them and

8780
05:13:46,920 --> 05:13:48,920
okay they can't do anything

8781
05:13:48,920 --> 05:13:50,920
I cried too

8782
05:13:50,920 --> 05:13:52,920
wait what was my joke

8783
05:13:52,920 --> 05:13:54,920
wait what joke did I just say

8784
05:13:54,920 --> 05:13:56,920
hold on

8785
05:13:56,920 --> 05:13:58,920
wait what did I say that was funny

8786
05:13:58,920 --> 05:14:00,920
go again

8787
05:14:00,920 --> 05:14:02,920
go again tell me, remain me

8788
05:14:02,920 --> 05:14:04,920
I've already forgotten

8789
05:14:06,920 --> 05:14:08,920
oh the Maggie Thatcher

8790
05:14:08,920 --> 05:14:10,920
alright sorry I thought it was a pun

8791
05:14:10,920 --> 05:14:12,920
I'm not gonna lie I had my fingers ready to do that

8792
05:14:14,920 --> 05:14:16,920
my apologies I thought I made a pun

8793
05:14:16,920 --> 05:14:18,920
and I was like what did I make that was funny

8794
05:14:18,920 --> 05:14:20,920
I forgot

8795
05:14:26,920 --> 05:14:28,920
crying fish and chips for my

8796
05:14:34,920 --> 05:14:36,920
so do you want to hear the

8797
05:14:36,920 --> 05:14:38,920
saddest story in all the land

8798
05:14:38,920 --> 05:14:40,920
I really like Mexican food

8799
05:14:40,920 --> 05:14:42,920
you know what I don't like

8800
05:14:42,920 --> 05:14:44,920
cilantro

8801
05:14:44,920 --> 05:14:46,920
and that stuff tastes awful

8802
05:14:46,920 --> 05:14:48,920
do you want to know what

8803
05:14:48,920 --> 05:14:50,920
cilantro

8804
05:14:50,920 --> 05:14:52,920
is primarily used in

8805
05:14:52,920 --> 05:14:54,920
that's right

8806
05:14:54,920 --> 05:14:56,920
Mexican cooking

8807
05:14:56,920 --> 05:14:58,920
man I

8808
05:14:58,920 --> 05:15:00,920
hated here

8809
05:15:00,920 --> 05:15:02,920
it tastes awful to me

8810
05:15:02,920 --> 05:15:04,920
absolutely awful

8811
05:15:04,920 --> 05:15:06,920
I tried a

8812
05:15:06,920 --> 05:15:08,920
I tried a

8813
05:15:08,920 --> 05:15:10,920
rice wrap I think it was

8814
05:15:10,920 --> 05:15:12,920
Vietnamese inspired rice wrap

8815
05:15:12,920 --> 05:15:14,920
no rice cake

8816
05:15:14,920 --> 05:15:16,920
with chicken in it

8817
05:15:16,920 --> 05:15:18,920
and it sounded so good and I took a bite

8818
05:15:18,920 --> 05:15:20,920
and I was like

8819
05:15:22,920 --> 05:15:24,920
in Australia

8820
05:15:24,920 --> 05:15:26,920
there's a lot more

8821
05:15:26,920 --> 05:15:28,920
access to Asian foods

8822
05:15:28,920 --> 05:15:30,920
that are authentic or really good type thing

8823
05:15:30,920 --> 05:15:32,920
which is why I'm currently

8824
05:15:32,920 --> 05:15:34,920
addicted to local Chinese

8825
05:15:38,920 --> 05:15:40,920
I've been adventurous

8826
05:15:40,920 --> 05:15:42,920
I'll try this I'll try that

8827
05:15:42,920 --> 05:15:44,920
and I couldn't figure out why I hated it

8828
05:15:44,920 --> 05:15:46,920
until I finally figured out

8829
05:15:46,920 --> 05:15:48,920
it's cilantro I can't handle

8830
05:15:48,920 --> 05:15:50,920
cilantro it tastes nasty

8831
05:15:50,920 --> 05:15:52,920
I'm so sorry

8832
05:15:52,920 --> 05:15:54,920
I apologize to those

8833
05:15:54,920 --> 05:15:56,920
who have

8834
05:15:56,920 --> 05:15:58,920
who do enjoy cilantro

8835
05:15:58,920 --> 05:16:00,920
yes I have the soap gene

8836
05:16:00,920 --> 05:16:02,920
I cannot even describe to you how nasty

8837
05:16:02,920 --> 05:16:04,920
and completely

8838
05:16:04,920 --> 05:16:06,920
ruins in any trace of it

8839
05:16:06,920 --> 05:16:08,920
in the food completely ruins the food as well

8840
05:16:08,920 --> 05:16:10,920
it is a

8841
05:16:10,920 --> 05:16:12,920
unlucky and unfun gene

8842
05:16:12,920 --> 05:16:14,920
to have

8843
05:16:14,920 --> 05:16:16,920
isn't it genetic

8844
05:16:16,920 --> 05:16:18,920
I don't know if it's genetic

8845
05:16:18,920 --> 05:16:20,920
my dad

8846
05:16:20,920 --> 05:16:22,920
I think eats it fine

8847
05:16:22,920 --> 05:16:24,920
because one time

8848
05:16:24,920 --> 05:16:26,920
he made like is it

8849
05:16:26,920 --> 05:16:28,920
Pico de Mayo or something

8850
05:16:28,920 --> 05:16:30,920
I'm so sorry I think I butchered that

8851
05:16:30,920 --> 05:16:32,920
he made it and I tasted it

8852
05:16:32,920 --> 05:16:34,920
and I was like this is nasty

8853
05:16:34,920 --> 05:16:36,920
but I never said that to him I just said

8854
05:16:36,920 --> 05:16:38,920
oh I don't think my taste buds agree with that

8855
05:16:38,920 --> 05:16:40,920
I never said anything but it's because of the cilantro

8856
05:16:40,920 --> 05:16:42,920
in it

8857
05:16:42,920 --> 05:16:44,920
Pico de Gallo

8858
05:16:44,920 --> 05:16:46,920
okay sorry

8859
05:16:46,920 --> 05:16:48,920
Pico de Gallo

8860
05:16:48,920 --> 05:16:50,920
yes I think my dad tried to make some of it at home

8861
05:16:50,920 --> 05:16:52,920
and

8862
05:16:52,920 --> 05:16:54,920
yeah I was like

8863
05:16:54,920 --> 05:16:56,920
nope

8864
05:17:00,920 --> 05:17:02,920
a bit of Boko no Pico

8865
05:17:02,920 --> 05:17:04,920
no Boko no Pico in it

8866
05:17:04,920 --> 05:17:06,920
yeah

8867
05:17:06,920 --> 05:17:08,920
I'm a fair share of it

8868
05:17:08,920 --> 05:17:10,920
absolutely horrific things I've consumed

8869
05:17:10,920 --> 05:17:12,920
where's the yellow thing

8870
05:17:12,920 --> 05:17:14,920
oh that reminds me of it

8871
05:17:14,920 --> 05:17:16,920
we need to do a watch along

8872
05:17:16,920 --> 05:17:18,920
of Kevin Bridges

8873
05:17:18,920 --> 05:17:20,920
um

8874
05:17:20,920 --> 05:17:22,920
Kevin Bridges

8875
05:17:22,920 --> 05:17:24,920
is a Scottish comedian you might know

8876
05:17:24,920 --> 05:17:26,920
someone called Frankie Boyle

8877
05:17:26,920 --> 05:17:28,920
or what's the other Scottish

8878
05:17:28,920 --> 05:17:30,920
comedian's name and I've forgotten his name

8879
05:17:30,920 --> 05:17:32,920
and he's got Parkinson's right now

8880
05:17:32,920 --> 05:17:34,920
but he's still alive I'm pretty sure

8881
05:17:36,920 --> 05:17:38,920
and he's got a beard and kind of

8882
05:17:38,920 --> 05:17:40,920
big

8883
05:17:40,920 --> 05:17:42,920
not curly hair but wavy hair

8884
05:17:42,920 --> 05:17:44,920
and he's older

8885
05:17:44,920 --> 05:17:46,920
oh my god what's his name

8886
05:17:48,920 --> 05:17:50,920
Billy Conley oh

8887
05:17:50,920 --> 05:17:52,920
Billy Conley

8888
05:17:52,920 --> 05:17:54,920
it took me so long to get there

8889
05:17:54,920 --> 05:17:56,920
holy crap Billy Conley

8890
05:17:56,920 --> 05:17:58,920
hold on I need to drink my tea before I get sick

8891
05:17:58,920 --> 05:18:00,920
mhm

8892
05:18:00,920 --> 05:18:02,920
mhm

8893
05:18:02,920 --> 05:18:04,920
mhm

8894
05:18:04,920 --> 05:18:06,920
so I put far too much

8895
05:18:06,920 --> 05:18:08,920
honey in my first team and I put far too much

8896
05:18:08,920 --> 05:18:10,920
little I can never find the balance

8897
05:18:10,920 --> 05:18:12,920
Billy Conley

8898
05:18:12,920 --> 05:18:14,920
is like real Scots I'm gonna do

8899
05:18:14,920 --> 05:18:16,920
watch alongs of like

8900
05:18:16,920 --> 05:18:18,920
Scottish comedy so

8901
05:18:18,920 --> 05:18:20,920
you guys can laugh and I can be like

8902
05:18:20,920 --> 05:18:22,920
why are the reeflings running in an X pattern

8903
05:18:22,920 --> 05:18:24,920
so they are

8904
05:18:24,920 --> 05:18:26,920
assigned each other to follow each other

8905
05:18:26,920 --> 05:18:28,920
which is causing this four way

8906
05:18:28,920 --> 05:18:30,920
oh my god what are you doing over there

8907
05:18:34,920 --> 05:18:36,920
so they're not actually clicking anymore

8908
05:18:36,920 --> 05:18:38,920
their characters are following

8909
05:18:38,920 --> 05:18:40,920
each other which is causing an infinite loop

8910
05:18:40,920 --> 05:18:42,920
which is pretty cool

8911
05:18:44,920 --> 05:18:46,920
wait you don't pronounce the second

8912
05:18:46,920 --> 05:18:48,920
Billy Conley

8913
05:18:48,920 --> 05:18:50,920
oh Billy Conley sorry

8914
05:18:50,920 --> 05:18:52,920
Billy Conley I'm not good with names

8915
05:18:52,920 --> 05:18:54,920
so don't expect any

8916
05:18:54,920 --> 05:18:56,920
don't expect a miracle with me ok

8917
05:18:56,920 --> 05:18:58,920
it's a scrawny summoning ritual

8918
05:18:58,920 --> 05:19:00,920
down with black rock

8919
05:19:04,920 --> 05:19:06,920
I love Kevin Bridges

8920
05:19:06,920 --> 05:19:08,920
my brother served him at a local club

8921
05:19:08,920 --> 05:19:10,920
he lives close to me oh that's amazing

8922
05:19:10,920 --> 05:19:12,920
I really enjoy Kevin Bridges humour

8923
05:19:12,920 --> 05:19:14,920
because it's quite

8924
05:19:14,920 --> 05:19:16,920
deadpan like British

8925
05:19:16,920 --> 05:19:18,920
humour is quite deadpan so

8926
05:19:18,920 --> 05:19:20,920
we'll probably do a watch

8927
05:19:20,920 --> 05:19:22,920
hey you're getting sturdy with it

8928
05:19:22,920 --> 05:19:24,920
hold on hold on hold on let me just

8929
05:19:24,920 --> 05:19:26,920
get the fish out of the bank first

8930
05:19:26,920 --> 05:19:28,920
hey reefling getting sturdy with it

8931
05:19:34,920 --> 05:19:36,920
I love all these emotes in the game

8932
05:19:36,920 --> 05:19:38,920
I haven't unlocked any more but

8933
05:19:38,920 --> 05:19:40,920
other than the default ones

8934
05:19:42,920 --> 05:19:44,920
this stomped on raught route

8935
05:19:44,920 --> 05:19:46,920
really sells me on the cult vibes

8936
05:19:46,920 --> 05:19:48,920
oh she be playing cult of the lamb

8937
05:19:48,920 --> 05:19:50,920
did she finish it yet

8938
05:19:50,920 --> 05:19:52,920
I think she was so close to finishing it

8939
05:19:52,920 --> 05:19:54,920
at last on you but maybe she did it

8940
05:19:58,920 --> 05:20:00,920
hydration

8941
05:20:02,920 --> 05:20:04,920
gears are quid

8942
05:20:04,920 --> 05:20:06,920
you're getting stabbed is a great one

8943
05:20:06,920 --> 05:20:08,920
it is oh my god

8944
05:20:08,920 --> 05:20:10,920
oh fat boy

8945
05:20:10,920 --> 05:20:12,920
I know this makes no

8946
05:20:12,920 --> 05:20:14,920
I'm gonna tell Kevin Bridges

8947
05:20:14,920 --> 05:20:16,920
his joke ok

8948
05:20:16,920 --> 05:20:18,920
so Kevin Bridges is

8949
05:20:18,920 --> 05:20:20,920
a man and he's quite large in size

8950
05:20:20,920 --> 05:20:22,920
I think he's lost a weight since or whatever

8951
05:20:22,920 --> 05:20:24,920
but he said he was like 25 stone

8952
05:20:24,920 --> 05:20:26,920
or something which is big

8953
05:20:26,920 --> 05:20:28,920
and he was telling the story

8954
05:20:28,920 --> 05:20:30,920
where he's out late at night

8955
05:20:30,920 --> 05:20:32,920
waiting on the bus

8956
05:20:32,920 --> 05:20:34,920
and some net comes up and goes

8957
05:20:34,920 --> 05:20:36,920
oh fat boy

8958
05:20:36,920 --> 05:20:38,920
gears are quid or you're getting stabbed

8959
05:20:38,920 --> 05:20:40,920
and then he's like

8960
05:20:40,920 --> 05:20:42,920
so I start calculating my BMI

8961
05:20:42,920 --> 05:20:44,920
with the other people around me

8962
05:20:44,920 --> 05:20:46,920
type thing

8963
05:20:46,920 --> 05:20:48,920
and this retains that it's him

8964
05:20:48,920 --> 05:20:50,920
that's been picked on by this person

8965
05:20:52,920 --> 05:20:54,920
and he's like in order

8966
05:20:54,920 --> 05:20:56,920
to avoid this heinous act

8967
05:20:56,920 --> 05:20:58,920
against me

8968
05:20:58,920 --> 05:21:00,920
for the mere price of a quid

8969
05:21:00,920 --> 05:21:02,920
I think that's a pretty good bargain

8970
05:21:02,920 --> 05:21:04,920
so he did not get stabbed that night

8971
05:21:06,920 --> 05:21:08,920
that's the best I can do for telling the joke

8972
05:21:08,920 --> 05:21:10,920
but it's a really good joke

8973
05:21:10,920 --> 05:21:12,920
I'll get us to do a watch along

8974
05:21:12,920 --> 05:21:14,920
Kevin Bridges

8975
05:21:14,920 --> 05:21:16,920
he's a local co-op

8976
05:21:16,920 --> 05:21:18,920
I know I'm going to play with sheebie

8977
05:21:18,920 --> 05:21:20,920
and we'll force her to play with me

8978
05:21:20,920 --> 05:21:22,920
he used to weigh about 350 pounds

8979
05:21:22,920 --> 05:21:24,920
woo

8980
05:21:24,920 --> 05:21:26,920
oh isn't there

8981
05:21:26,920 --> 05:21:28,920
there's an American place that lets you eat for free

8982
05:21:28,920 --> 05:21:30,920
um

8983
05:21:30,920 --> 05:21:32,920
if you're over like

8984
05:21:32,920 --> 05:21:34,920
heart attack grill oh my god I'm so sorry

8985
05:21:34,920 --> 05:21:36,920
I look at videos of heart attack grill

8986
05:21:36,920 --> 05:21:38,920
I think it's so fascinating

8987
05:21:38,920 --> 05:21:40,920
um

8988
05:21:40,920 --> 05:21:42,920
there's like a weight outside the restaurant

8989
05:21:42,920 --> 05:21:44,920
if you are over that weight

8990
05:21:44,920 --> 05:21:46,920
you get to eat for free

8991
05:21:46,920 --> 05:21:48,920
I'm like wow

8992
05:21:48,920 --> 05:21:50,920
25 stone equals 160 kg

8993
05:21:50,920 --> 05:21:52,920
mmm

8994
05:21:52,920 --> 05:21:54,920
what are you going to do

8995
05:21:54,920 --> 05:21:56,920
stab him

8996
05:21:56,920 --> 05:21:58,920
he says as he gets shanked

8997
05:21:58,920 --> 05:22:00,920
I was a bit premature there

8998
05:22:00,920 --> 05:22:02,920
wow we are like

8999
05:22:02,920 --> 05:22:04,920
burning through these

9000
05:22:04,920 --> 05:22:06,920
well I don't know what level

9001
05:22:06,920 --> 05:22:08,920
I can cook those

9002
05:22:08,920 --> 05:22:10,920
octopusies

9003
05:22:10,920 --> 05:22:12,920
but

9004
05:22:12,920 --> 05:22:14,920
I think we'll go to the grand exchange

9005
05:22:14,920 --> 05:22:16,920
and buy some I have a terrible feeling

9006
05:22:16,920 --> 05:22:18,920
they are

9007
05:22:18,920 --> 05:22:20,920
a membership only

9008
05:22:20,920 --> 05:22:22,920
item

9009
05:22:22,920 --> 05:22:24,920
so we might have to swap to a membership world

9010
05:22:24,920 --> 05:22:26,920
which is a shame for anyone who's not a member

9011
05:22:26,920 --> 05:22:28,920
the heart attack grill

9012
05:22:28,920 --> 05:22:30,920
mmm

9013
05:22:32,920 --> 05:22:34,920
isn't heart attack grill

9014
05:22:34,920 --> 05:22:36,920
just a place because the owner hates fat people

9015
05:22:36,920 --> 05:22:38,920
and wants them to die

9016
05:22:38,920 --> 05:22:40,920
is that the lore

9017
05:22:40,920 --> 05:22:42,920
or

9018
05:22:42,920 --> 05:22:44,920
wines is probably better

9019
05:22:44,920 --> 05:22:46,920
at that point

9020
05:22:46,920 --> 05:22:48,920
wait carabaan

9021
05:22:48,920 --> 05:22:50,920
wines better than carabaan

9022
05:22:50,920 --> 05:22:52,920
caramwa

9023
05:22:52,920 --> 05:22:54,920
I'm sorry

9024
05:22:54,920 --> 05:22:56,920
I'm not saying that right

9025
05:22:56,920 --> 05:22:58,920
I'm not even going to pretend I'm saying it right

9026
05:22:58,920 --> 05:23:00,920
what level cooking

9027
05:23:00,920 --> 05:23:02,920
I am 70 on the dot

9028
05:23:04,920 --> 05:23:06,920
I'm revealing someone

9029
05:23:06,920 --> 05:23:08,920
I'm going to get some octopusies

9030
05:23:10,920 --> 05:23:12,920
honestly mate

9031
05:23:12,920 --> 05:23:14,920
honestly mate

9032
05:23:14,920 --> 05:23:16,920
right I've had a nature valley bar

9033
05:23:16,920 --> 05:23:18,920
I've had a muffin and I don't actually feel like eating

9034
05:23:18,920 --> 05:23:20,920
that's what I'm saying when a stream

9035
05:23:20,920 --> 05:23:22,920
I don't feel like eating properly

9036
05:23:22,920 --> 05:23:24,920
tick manipulation

9037
05:23:24,920 --> 05:23:26,920
oh I'm not that good at the game

9038
05:23:26,920 --> 05:23:28,920
I'm not that good at the game

9039
05:23:28,920 --> 05:23:30,920
tick manipulation

9040
05:23:30,920 --> 05:23:32,920
fat chance of me

9041
05:23:32,920 --> 05:23:34,920
eh

9042
05:23:36,920 --> 05:23:38,920
wa wa wa

9043
05:23:44,920 --> 05:23:46,920
oh boy

9044
05:23:46,920 --> 05:23:48,920
really going to get me a bye memory

9045
05:23:48,920 --> 05:23:50,920
wait until we've decided on what's going on

9046
05:23:52,920 --> 05:23:54,920
are you squidding me right now

9047
05:23:56,920 --> 05:23:58,920
kill more

9048
05:23:58,920 --> 05:24:00,920
combine

9049
05:24:02,920 --> 05:24:04,920
what are you saying

9050
05:24:04,920 --> 05:24:06,920
redheads are from Ireland

9051
05:24:06,920 --> 05:24:08,920
and I said redheads came from Scotland

9052
05:24:08,920 --> 05:24:10,920
Ireland has a higher redhead

9053
05:24:10,920 --> 05:24:12,920
percentage

9054
05:24:12,920 --> 05:24:14,920
I believe

9055
05:24:14,920 --> 05:24:16,920
but you must

9056
05:24:16,920 --> 05:24:18,920
acknowledge with that

9057
05:24:18,920 --> 05:24:20,920
that due to the Irish

9058
05:24:20,920 --> 05:24:22,920
potato famine

9059
05:24:22,920 --> 05:24:24,920
which was actually just a British government

9060
05:24:24,920 --> 05:24:26,920
starving the people

9061
05:24:26,920 --> 05:24:28,920
a lot of Irish migrants

9062
05:24:28,920 --> 05:24:30,920
went into Scotland

9063
05:24:30,920 --> 05:24:32,920
because it's a

9064
05:24:32,920 --> 05:24:34,920
very close company

9065
05:24:34,920 --> 05:24:36,920
company

9066
05:24:38,920 --> 05:24:40,920
thank you for the 5

9067
05:24:40,920 --> 05:24:42,920
but I want to say

9068
05:24:42,920 --> 05:24:44,920
I think your girlfriend's right where the redheads

9069
05:24:44,920 --> 05:24:46,920
are from Ireland

9070
05:24:48,920 --> 05:24:50,920
give them to Mumme

9071
05:24:50,920 --> 05:24:52,920
wait what

9072
05:24:52,920 --> 05:24:54,920
he wants my winemaking supplies

9073
05:24:54,920 --> 05:24:56,920
wait is wine faster

9074
05:24:56,920 --> 05:24:58,920
hold on

9075
05:24:58,920 --> 05:25:00,920
I'm banking

9076
05:25:00,920 --> 05:25:02,920
what does wine look like

9077
05:25:02,920 --> 05:25:04,920
how do I get wine

9078
05:25:04,920 --> 05:25:06,920
Shawnee if you right click game at the bottom of the screen

9079
05:25:06,920 --> 05:25:08,920
and click

9080
05:25:08,920 --> 05:25:10,920
game

9081
05:25:10,920 --> 05:25:12,920
Shawnee if you right click game at the bottom of the screen

9082
05:25:12,920 --> 05:25:14,920
and click filler

9083
05:25:14,920 --> 05:25:16,920
it will hate all the cooking messages

9084
05:25:16,920 --> 05:25:18,920
oh

9085
05:25:30,920 --> 05:25:32,920
thank you

thank you

9088
05:25:36,920 --> 05:25:38,920
Gael Gantres

9089
05:25:38,920 --> 05:25:40,920
for becoming a member

9090
05:25:40,920 --> 05:25:42,920
I appreciate it

9091
05:25:42,920 --> 05:25:44,920
government starving people

9092
05:25:44,920 --> 05:25:51,480
bet that hasn't even happened to tons of other countries as well. Redheads are from the Northern

9093
05:25:52,360 --> 05:25:59,560
Kingdom Catholics. I actually have the redhead gene so if any refling has it too and you want to

9094
05:26:00,440 --> 05:26:09,320
rendezvous with me we might make more Emmys. What? That's a lot! Wait how do I do that?

9095
05:26:10,200 --> 05:26:14,840
oh wait wait wait hold on hold on hold on thank you so much refling oh my god wait what do i do though

9096
05:26:15,800 --> 05:26:18,120
hold on hold on give the thing give the thing

9097
05:26:20,920 --> 05:26:28,440
take out 14 i think i take take out 14 and then shove them together like this is this faster?

9098
05:26:31,640 --> 05:26:33,480
oh i don't know if it is this faster

9099
05:26:34,280 --> 05:26:38,920
oh thanks for the two

9100
05:26:45,160 --> 05:26:52,360
let's make more Gert gingers together right and then do it like this okay that worked

9101
05:26:55,080 --> 05:27:00,520
make sure you do it every 14 seconds so you get a huge xv drop put 14 in the bank and then combine

9102
05:27:01,240 --> 05:27:04,360
the chat it gives about 2200 average

9103
05:27:06,440 --> 05:27:13,000
huh so this is more or less than cooking the swordies

9104
05:27:14,760 --> 05:27:17,640
i gotta go for i've got 14 second random timer

9105
05:27:18,840 --> 05:27:24,680
they take a bit to ferment okay i'll ferment you i'll ferment you in a minute in between these

9106
05:27:25,640 --> 05:27:29,480
sorry breeding more gingers into the world of strong

9107
05:27:35,800 --> 05:27:38,760
you can also right click the x button oh i fucked up

9108
05:27:39,960 --> 05:27:43,560
oh no they're gonna ferment before i'm ready don't ferment don't ferment i'm getting scared

9109
05:27:44,600 --> 05:27:49,480
can't throw it me real good then the only ferment when you aren't crafting wine how bizarre okay

9110
05:27:50,120 --> 05:27:56,440
okay i guess can you get bad wine or is wine always successful you can use the x button on

9111
05:27:56,440 --> 05:28:02,520
the bottom of your bank tab so you can bank all isn't it no faster if i like pull out wine

9112
05:28:02,520 --> 05:28:10,040
put wine away pull out water pull out grape you can make bad wine did i burnt fish people

9113
05:28:10,120 --> 05:28:13,560
buy bad wine then click twice as fast

9114
05:28:18,920 --> 05:28:24,440
is it painful watching someone trying to maximize their like xp gain and they're doing it all wrong

9115
05:28:24,440 --> 05:28:29,400
you're just like oh god i can't watch this anymore that's what two clicks

9116
05:28:32,040 --> 05:28:37,880
now it's fun to watch you can't get bad wine because you're such high level

9117
05:28:38,840 --> 05:28:42,120
so you pull it 14 each and can bank all after

9118
05:28:55,080 --> 05:28:59,000
ah was that right did i do it right

9119
05:29:02,280 --> 05:29:06,840
the second 14 yeah i think i did it right okay we did it we got there in the end

9120

9149
05:32:45,480 --> 05:32:54,920
yeah like um so edmund was like uh too bad seven seven fifty trout is worth like a hundred key

9150

what empty sack click click combine space bar here we go we're getting there we're getting there

9151
05:33:02,280 --> 05:33:07,960
we're getting after repentance i feel like well there's been a bit of whispers about the binding

9152
05:33:07,960 --> 05:33:15,000
of isaac because someone did a cheeky datamine when they shouldn't have um and there was something

9153
05:33:15,000 --> 05:33:24,840
called the repentance plus it is possible empty sack click click combine yes i might need to do that

9154
05:33:24,840 --> 05:33:40,120
escape thing honestly um you can set buttons to escape in space honestly um yeah so it's possible

9155
05:33:40,120 --> 05:33:46,920
there might be an item update i am not parent sorry and hold on hold on i can't talk into that

9156
05:33:46,920 --> 05:33:51,960
at the same time it's possible that they're gonna have a slight change to some items and all that

9157
05:33:51,960 --> 05:33:58,440
jazz the dlc does come out in november which means we can all play multiplayer together and i'm going

9158
05:33:58,440 --> 05:34:06,680
to go crazy i'm gonna go crazy sorry um you literally you're gonna be sick of it but i think

9159
05:34:06,680 --> 05:34:14,760
it would be really empty sack it would be really good to get dead god together i think that would

9160
05:34:14,760 --> 05:34:20,440
be crazy because it would make it so much easier of all through like the max lobby size is four

9161
05:34:20,440 --> 05:34:25,960
so three reeflings at a time can do a run with me and and i'll just do it the way we did with

9162
05:34:25,960 --> 05:34:30,840
elton ring where i write down your name and who got in and you know take it from their type thing

9185
05:37:45,000 --> 05:37:47,080
i'm going to pretend that's the truth

9186
05:37:49,640 --> 05:37:54,200
oh my god this is i will say the cooking was a lot easier to read stream the only thing i

9187
05:37:54,200 --> 05:37:56,840
I don't like about Wines as it's over so quickly.

9188
05:37:58,280 --> 05:38:00,680
It's over so quickly, it's so quick.

9189
05:38:01,720 --> 05:38:03,240
I can't reach out and think.

9190
05:38:03,960 --> 05:38:08,600
Either die here, a hero, or live long enough to be on the market.

9191
05:38:09,240 --> 05:38:09,800
Honestly.

9192
05:38:10,600 --> 05:38:13,080
Oh god, my brain can't keep up with this.

9193
05:38:13,080 --> 05:38:13,560
Escape.

9194
05:38:14,200 --> 05:38:17,320
God, we're even, we're at like almost 5k grade.

9195
05:38:17,880 --> 05:38:20,040
Wait, oh sorry, I was supposed to do space one up.

9196
05:38:21,640 --> 05:38:23,560
Do you plan on making an old school runescape pop?

9197
05:38:23,560 --> 05:38:25,160
No, I don't know what planning is.

9198
05:38:25,160 --> 05:38:27,400
I've never done it or been in one before.

9199
05:38:27,400 --> 05:38:31,720
I just used to be the scammer at the exchange post that was like double in money.

9200
05:38:31,720 --> 05:38:32,280
That's me.

9201
05:38:33,240 --> 05:38:34,040
That's what I did.

9202
05:38:35,800 --> 05:38:36,680
I can't believe it.

9203
05:38:36,680 --> 05:38:37,480
I can't believe it.

9204
05:38:39,400 --> 05:38:40,360
Wait, combine?

9205
05:38:40,360 --> 05:38:41,800
Oh, I never hit escape that time.

9206
05:38:46,920 --> 05:38:48,120
Wait, what?

9207
05:38:48,120 --> 05:38:49,800
Did Stony cause a spike?

9208
05:38:49,800 --> 05:38:53,240
Apparently the price of trout is going really weird right now.

9209
05:38:53,720 --> 05:38:57,400
Stony took all my money.

9210
05:38:57,400 --> 05:38:59,480
I'm sorry, I took your 1000 gold.

9211
05:38:59,480 --> 05:39:04,280
I assure you I did absolutely nothing with it because I abandoned the account probably and never bothered again.

9212
05:39:05,960 --> 05:39:06,760
Price trout.

9213
05:39:07,720 --> 05:39:09,480
Trout is 41.

9214
05:39:12,520 --> 05:39:13,240
Raw trout.

9215
05:39:15,800 --> 05:39:18,120
190 for raw trout.

9216
05:39:19,320 --> 05:39:21,160
Quick selling for like 189.

9217
05:39:23,560 --> 05:39:24,520
Did we actually?

9218
05:39:24,520 --> 05:39:25,080
One goes.

9219
05:39:25,640 --> 05:39:27,000
Oh wait, sorry, sorry.

9220
05:39:27,000 --> 05:39:28,120
I'm messing up the struts.

9221
05:39:30,600 --> 05:39:33,800
Stony drawing a big tentacle in the price chart.

9222
05:39:40,920 --> 05:39:45,720
Well, I'm happy that we at least reached 70.

9223
05:39:47,720 --> 05:39:49,080
That is good.

9224
05:39:49,720 --> 05:39:51,480
Sorry, I'm messing up the strut.

9225
05:39:51,480 --> 05:39:52,280
Please don't look.

9226
05:39:52,280 --> 05:39:53,560
Please don't look, I'm embarrassed.

9227
05:39:53,560 --> 05:39:58,040
Um, I don't know what we're going to end on.

9228
05:39:58,040 --> 05:40:03,240
If we do, I think someone said it was like five endurance streams.

9229
05:40:03,240 --> 05:40:07,240
If I just like non-stop did this, then I would reach it.

9230
05:40:07,240 --> 05:40:08,280
I was hoping.

9231
05:40:11,640 --> 05:40:13,080
Wait, oh no, I messed that up.

9232
05:40:13,080 --> 05:40:14,680
Oh no, it's going to ferment.

9233
05:40:14,680 --> 05:40:19,000
Don't ferment, don't ferment, don't ferment, don't ferment, don't ferment.

9234
05:40:19,880 --> 05:40:25,800
I was like, honestly, it's less about being efficient and more about saving our hands.

9235
05:40:27,800 --> 05:40:30,520
So you guys don't have to stoke the fire for me all the time.

9236
05:40:38,600 --> 05:40:39,100
Wah.

9237
05:40:40,200 --> 05:40:43,480
Bing, bang, boom, bat pal.

9238
05:40:44,600 --> 05:40:47,080
Ah, I completely did not strut that up, but whatever.

9239
05:40:48,040 --> 05:40:51,320
Eh, Stronner really wants that giant XP bomb.

9240
05:40:51,320 --> 05:40:55,640
Well, I'm wondering, could we just keep doing it until they're all gone?

9241
05:40:55,640 --> 05:41:00,280
I don't know how long it takes to do 6,000 wines though.

9242
05:41:00,280 --> 05:41:05,400
I could only do 14 per inventory slot, which is a bit of a problem.

9243
05:41:07,240 --> 05:41:10,440
So I need like just, what, 14?

9244
05:41:11,640 --> 05:41:15,000
How many 14s does it take to get to 100?

9245
05:41:15,000 --> 05:41:15,560
I don't know.

9246
05:41:17,400 --> 05:41:20,280
But I'm gonna be here for a while, I think.

9247
05:41:20,280 --> 05:41:21,240
Or is it 6?

9248
05:41:22,600 --> 05:41:23,480
No, 14.

9249
05:41:24,600 --> 05:41:26,520
My right wrist is death messed up.

9250
05:41:26,520 --> 05:41:28,040
Oh my god, are you okay, Riefling?

9251
05:41:28,600 --> 05:41:29,320
From this game?

9252
05:41:29,320 --> 05:41:30,520
Because you've been playing this game?

9253
05:41:33,560 --> 05:41:34,520
So many grapes.

9254
05:41:36,920 --> 05:41:39,240
Wait, people just XP bomb for fun?

9255
05:41:41,960 --> 05:41:42,680
Mostly yes.

9256
05:41:42,840 --> 05:41:43,480
It's not cool.

9257
05:41:45,240 --> 05:41:47,720
Keep going to click on that guy, but I'm not to click on him.

9258
05:41:48,680 --> 05:41:51,160
Right, empty the sack.

9259
05:41:51,160 --> 05:41:52,840
Click on the ingredients.

9260
05:41:52,840 --> 05:41:55,560
Escape, combine, space bar.

9261
05:41:55,560 --> 05:41:56,760
See, I didn't write that time.

9262
05:41:56,760 --> 05:41:59,000
I have to like mentally bring it to my head.

9263
05:42:01,800 --> 05:42:02,360
How much?

9264
05:42:04,600 --> 05:42:05,160
Seven.

9265
05:42:05,160 --> 05:42:08,200
So I need seven inventories to do 100.

9266
05:42:08,200 --> 05:42:09,000
That's quite a lot.

9267
05:42:09,880 --> 05:42:18,440
I've messed up, but that's okay.

9268
05:42:18,440 --> 05:42:19,400
I'm trying my best.

9269
05:42:21,400 --> 05:42:26,440
You need roughly 62k wines to get from 68 to 99.

9270
05:42:26,440 --> 05:42:26,920
Bruv!

9271
05:42:28,120 --> 05:42:29,160
Who picked this?

9272
05:42:29,160 --> 05:42:29,800
Is there not?

9273
05:42:29,800 --> 05:42:31,160
Right, let's do fletching.

9274
05:42:31,160 --> 05:42:32,840
We can do fletching in four hours.

9275
05:42:34,200 --> 05:42:35,720
We're getting how many wines?

9276
05:42:36,280 --> 05:42:38,920
There's no way I can do that.

9277
05:42:39,320 --> 05:42:41,240
I'm starting, oh no, I'm starting to have doubt.

9278
05:42:41,800 --> 05:42:43,400
Reflings, have I messed up?

9279
05:42:44,360 --> 05:42:46,040
Have I messed up picking this game?

9280
05:42:48,280 --> 05:42:50,040
It's 200 XP per wine.

9281
05:42:50,040 --> 05:42:51,240
Oh, that's more than the fish.

9282
05:42:53,080 --> 05:42:55,160
Fletching is death going to mess up your route.

9283
05:42:56,280 --> 05:42:58,120
Have I made a mistake picking King?

9284
05:42:59,400 --> 05:43:00,280
I'm getting nervous.

9285
05:43:00,280 --> 05:43:01,240
I'm getting chicken.

9286
05:43:01,240 --> 05:43:04,360
Now, I did say the next time we do RuneScape,

9287
05:43:05,000 --> 05:43:08,920
I'm going, we're going to do a movie watch along as well,

9288
05:43:09,800 --> 05:43:12,280
just so I can rest my voice.

9289
05:43:16,920 --> 05:43:18,360
How's the cooking going?

9290
05:43:18,360 --> 05:43:20,600
We're starting to feel a bit daunted now,

9291
05:43:20,600 --> 05:43:24,440
and it's starting to settle in like, oh no, this is a lot.

9292
05:43:25,960 --> 05:43:29,640
The next time we do a RuneScape stream,

9293
05:43:29,640 --> 05:43:31,720
we are going to be watching a movie series,

9294
05:43:31,720 --> 05:43:34,040
so I don't have to talk and I can rest my voice a little bit,

9295
05:43:34,040 --> 05:43:36,360
because I do have quite a few ASMR collabs coming up,

9296
05:43:36,360 --> 05:43:39,000
and I need to keep my voice steady.

9297
05:43:39,720 --> 05:43:41,720
I need my voice to be steady and ready.

9298
05:43:42,600 --> 05:43:45,560
Wines are like 480k if you're consistent.

9299
05:43:46,280 --> 05:43:49,960
Per hour, I mean, it's all right.

9300
05:43:53,640 --> 05:43:59,160
You need 87k swordfish, so wines are still faster in the end.

9301
05:43:59,160 --> 05:44:00,360
Oh my gosh.

9302
05:44:00,360 --> 05:44:02,360
Oh.

9303
05:44:05,560 --> 05:44:06,440
Reeflings.

9304
05:44:06,440 --> 05:44:08,760
I think I might have messed up picking cooking,

9305
05:44:09,960 --> 05:44:11,320
but I really want 99.

9306
05:44:11,320 --> 05:44:13,080
I've never had my first 99 before.

9307
05:44:16,280 --> 05:44:18,280
Oh, I'm getting nervous.

9308
05:44:18,280 --> 05:44:19,320
I'm getting shaky.

9309
05:44:19,320 --> 05:44:20,040
Just drain back.

9310
05:44:20,040 --> 05:44:22,040
What's with the ritual dance at the top of the screen?

9311
05:44:22,040 --> 05:44:23,080
Those are reeflings.

9312
05:44:23,080 --> 05:44:24,520
They're just dancing with each other.

9313
05:44:25,160 --> 05:44:26,760
We're all hanging out at the fire.

9314
05:44:27,720 --> 05:44:30,040
Remember, level 92 is halfway.

9315
05:44:30,040 --> 05:44:30,600
Stop.

9316
05:44:30,600 --> 05:44:31,560
Is it actually?

9317
05:44:38,360 --> 05:44:39,160
No.

9318
05:44:39,160 --> 05:44:40,760
I will not give myself doubt.

9319
05:44:42,280 --> 05:44:45,560
I'll see what happens after the movie marathon.

9320
05:44:49,160 --> 05:44:50,760
XP wise, it's halfway.

9321
05:44:51,400 --> 05:44:54,280
I know what happened to the legendary stamina.

9322
05:44:54,280 --> 05:44:55,400
I'm getting nervous.

9323
05:44:55,400 --> 05:44:57,720
I don't know if I have an end in stamina now.

9324
05:44:58,440 --> 05:44:59,400
I'm getting shaky.

9325
05:44:59,400 --> 05:45:00,200
Wait.

9326
05:45:00,200 --> 05:45:00,520
Right.

9327
05:45:00,520 --> 05:45:01,000
Empty.

9328
05:45:06,920 --> 05:45:09,400
Cooking is the fastest without completely ruined.

9329
05:45:09,400 --> 05:45:10,440
Like cooking fish.

9330
05:45:12,280 --> 05:45:15,160
Isn't it good that we'll be there with it?

9331
05:45:17,240 --> 05:45:17,640
Yeah.

9332
05:45:17,640 --> 05:45:19,480
Next runescape stream though.

9333
05:45:19,480 --> 05:45:20,680
I'm going to be watching a movie,

9334
05:45:20,680 --> 05:45:24,680
so I'm not talking too much because my voice is getting shredded.

9335
05:45:25,960 --> 05:45:27,080
But I love it.

9336
05:45:27,080 --> 05:45:27,720
Can't help.

9337
05:45:27,720 --> 05:45:28,680
Can't stop talking.

9338
05:45:28,680 --> 05:45:29,000
Okay.

9339
05:45:33,240 --> 05:45:34,920
Making winds is faster.

9340
05:45:36,840 --> 05:45:39,160
But the reeflings here in 99 shouldn't be a problem.

9341
05:45:39,160 --> 05:45:39,480
Okay.

9342
05:45:39,480 --> 05:45:39,800
Okay.

9343
05:45:39,800 --> 05:45:40,280
Okay.

9344
05:45:44,040 --> 05:45:44,440
Wow.

9345
05:45:45,640 --> 05:45:49,000
Although it'd be really cool to look back and see how much time I spent.

9346
05:45:50,120 --> 05:45:54,200
I wouldn't mind doing some questing after we get 99 cooking.

9347
05:45:54,760 --> 05:46:00,040
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do 99 cooking in one month though.

9348
05:46:00,040 --> 05:46:02,440
Because of the streams that I've got planned out.

9349
05:46:02,440 --> 05:46:04,760
It doesn't really work that well.

9350
05:46:04,760 --> 05:46:05,880
Because of Elden Ring.

9351
05:46:08,840 --> 05:46:09,960
Because of Elden Ring.

9352
05:46:11,960 --> 05:46:15,240
I would have been able to put more time into Rinscape.

9353
05:46:15,240 --> 05:46:16,600
But because of Elden Ring.

9354
05:46:17,560 --> 05:46:18,440
99 cooking.

9355
05:46:18,440 --> 05:46:20,840
That's all because of a mediocre joke.

9356
05:46:20,840 --> 05:46:21,800
That you're a whammin.

9357
05:46:22,360 --> 05:46:22,840
Hell yeah.

9358
05:46:23,640 --> 05:46:24,600
You got this Johnny.

9359
05:46:25,400 --> 05:46:26,520
We'll make you our ma-

9360
05:46:26,520 --> 05:46:27,880
We'll get you a master chef.

9361
05:46:31,720 --> 05:46:37,720
But it would be kind of cool to look back at like the stream thumbnails and see how much time it took.

9362
05:46:38,680 --> 05:46:40,520
Obviously we did some questing.

9363
05:46:40,520 --> 05:46:44,120
The first I had so much fun like doing all those quests and like waiting for everyone

9364
05:46:44,120 --> 05:46:46,280
and be like okay we'll do this next we'll do this next.

9365
05:46:47,080 --> 05:46:52,040
Um so if I do achieve 99 cooking and I'm not burnt out of Rinscape.

9366
05:46:52,920 --> 05:46:55,000
Then pardon me I'm burping away here.

9367
05:46:55,640 --> 05:47:02,440
Uh I actually wouldn't mind um I wouldn't mind what.

9368
05:47:02,440 --> 05:47:05,480
I wouldn't mind doing some more questing again together because that's quite fun.

9369
05:47:05,480 --> 05:47:12,360
And it's more interactive than literally you do need to do a quest to cook a coambas.

9370
05:47:12,360 --> 05:47:15,480
I can never say I don't know what on earth I'm supposed to pronounce them as.

9371
05:47:16,200 --> 05:47:20,600
Um are they better XP than wine?

9372
05:47:20,840 --> 05:47:23,160
This is the question.

9373
05:47:24,440 --> 05:47:27,320
Do I need combat for that quest by any chance?

9374
05:47:32,360 --> 05:47:35,000
50 subs away from 60 stop.

9375
05:47:35,000 --> 05:47:36,760
Is that video still getting traction?

9376
05:47:37,400 --> 05:47:38,920
Yat. Oh my yat.

9377
05:47:39,960 --> 05:47:41,800
Sticking at my yat for the river.

9378
05:47:43,720 --> 05:47:46,040
Oh would a Scottish cover of that go viral?

9379
05:47:46,920 --> 05:47:48,760
Only by tick manipulating.

9380
05:47:48,760 --> 05:47:53,400
Right no if wait so I'm just doing wines for the rest of this entire gig.

9381
05:47:55,480 --> 05:47:59,800
Oh no it's only faster if you're paying attention.

9382
05:48:00,920 --> 05:48:02,760
I'm just doing wines for the rest.

9383
05:48:02,760 --> 05:48:05,080
Oh this is terrible stream content.

9384
05:48:07,160 --> 05:48:10,840
You guys just seem to go back and forth to make more wines.

9385
05:48:10,840 --> 05:48:13,480
Wait so then why was that chick doing lobsters?

9386
05:48:13,720 --> 05:48:17,400
We're the one with the big jibblies out.

9387
05:48:17,400 --> 05:48:19,560
Why does she do lobsters for chicken?

9388
05:48:19,560 --> 05:48:21,160
Is lobsters cheaper?

9389
05:48:21,160 --> 05:48:21,960
Cheaper.

9390
05:48:21,960 --> 05:48:23,160
Can I always switch it up?

9391
05:48:23,160 --> 05:48:25,960
Yeah I'll maybe finish my swordfish.

9392
05:48:25,960 --> 05:48:30,360
Once this batch for a minute I'll swap back to the swordfish.

9393
05:48:30,360 --> 05:48:33,160
Just so like everything the reeflings gave me and being used up.

9394
05:48:33,160 --> 05:48:34,920
That seems like the wisest thing.

9395
05:48:34,920 --> 05:48:35,480
It's cum.

9396
05:48:36,760 --> 05:48:38,520
Oh yeah you like when I yap at you?

9397
05:48:38,520 --> 05:48:40,200
I'll yap all over you.

9398
05:48:40,200 --> 05:48:41,160
All over your face.

9399
05:48:41,720 --> 05:48:42,360
Your stomach.

9400
05:48:43,240 --> 05:48:43,880
Your thighs.

9401
05:48:45,960 --> 05:48:48,840
Fish would be way slower but way less attention.

9402
05:48:48,840 --> 05:48:53,240
Yeah um the wane attention batch is getting pretty rough.

9403
05:48:53,240 --> 05:48:56,280
I know I can I'm sorry I'm touching my boob right now.

9404
05:48:56,280 --> 05:48:59,160
I'm like I'm not even pretending otherwise.

9405
05:48:59,160 --> 05:49:00,920
Um I've only got one hand.

9406
05:49:00,920 --> 05:49:01,800
Available right now.

9407
05:49:04,280 --> 05:49:05,400
We do love the gap.

9408
05:49:05,400 --> 05:49:07,480
You can literally just talk to us for the content.

9409
05:49:07,480 --> 05:49:08,680
That's why I'm here.

9410
05:49:13,320 --> 05:49:17,240
Oh no right.

9411
05:49:17,960 --> 05:49:20,920
I think we can finish off the swordfish and the wane.

9412
05:49:23,160 --> 05:49:26,440
Also it was actually really funny that you just straight up handed me like your

9413
05:49:26,440 --> 05:49:27,400
wane collection.

9414
05:49:27,400 --> 05:49:28,280
No questions.

9415
05:49:28,280 --> 05:49:29,640
You're not like no this is mine.

9416
05:49:29,640 --> 05:49:31,160
You're just like I hear habits Johnny.

9417
05:49:32,360 --> 05:49:34,600
That's quite funny actually now that I think about it.

9418
05:49:34,600 --> 05:49:36,280
You're like oh there's no point in arguing.

9419
05:49:36,280 --> 05:49:36,920
She can have it.

9420
05:49:37,880 --> 05:49:40,600
Um wow.

9421
05:49:42,040 --> 05:49:43,160
Wow you did it.

9422
05:49:46,360 --> 05:49:46,840
Rank.

9423
05:49:49,000 --> 05:49:49,480
Wow.

9424
05:49:51,400 --> 05:49:52,520
Oh that's so big.

9425
05:49:54,200 --> 05:49:55,080
Thanks so much.

9426
05:49:56,280 --> 05:50:00,440
Oh you can get it.

9427
05:50:01,240 --> 05:50:02,840
Oh sorry I'm getting distracted.

9428
05:50:02,840 --> 05:50:03,880
Wane don't ferment.

9429
05:50:03,880 --> 05:50:04,840
I got distracted.

9430
05:50:04,840 --> 05:50:05,800
I was reading.

9431
05:50:05,800 --> 05:50:06,440
Don't ferment.

9432
05:50:06,440 --> 05:50:07,080
Don't ferment.

9433
05:50:10,440 --> 05:50:12,120
Your yapping is so strong.

9434
05:50:12,120 --> 05:50:14,360
You forgot that you were also playing RuneScape.

9435
05:50:14,360 --> 05:50:16,440
The game is more a background to you.

9436
05:50:16,440 --> 05:50:16,920
Honestly.

9437
05:50:17,640 --> 05:50:19,560
Reef was trying to get a moment of rope.

9438
05:50:19,560 --> 05:50:20,840
With all this wine.

9439
05:50:20,840 --> 05:50:21,480
Exactly.

9440
05:50:23,480 --> 05:50:26,120
Forfeit all mortal possessions to the cult of vice.

9441
05:50:26,120 --> 05:50:27,880
No look after yourself.

9442
05:50:27,880 --> 05:50:29,160
Get yourself out of debt.

9443
05:50:29,960 --> 05:50:32,360
Buy yourself treaties at the corner shop.

9444
05:50:33,240 --> 05:50:34,680
And then and only then.

9445
05:50:35,800 --> 05:50:37,560
The fermentation is top left.

9446
05:50:37,560 --> 05:50:38,040
Oh.

9447
05:50:40,360 --> 05:50:41,080
Wow.

9448
05:50:41,080 --> 05:50:41,880
That's so cool.

9449
05:50:41,880 --> 05:50:43,000
Man Rune.

9450
05:50:43,000 --> 05:50:45,400
Rune light plug-in is so good.

9451
05:50:47,720 --> 05:50:48,760
We're learning.

9452
05:50:48,760 --> 05:50:49,400
We're learning.

9453
05:50:56,600 --> 05:50:57,320
Plap plap plap.

9454
05:50:57,320 --> 05:50:57,880
Don't ferment.

9455
05:50:57,880 --> 05:50:58,440
Don't ferment.

9456
05:50:58,440 --> 05:50:59,240
Don't ferment.

9457
05:50:59,240 --> 05:51:00,920
I was actually there is like this

9458
05:51:00,920 --> 05:51:02,680
feature of her that posted a thing.

9459
05:51:03,240 --> 05:51:04,360
Where this song's like.

9460
05:51:04,520 --> 05:51:08,040
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

9461
05:51:08,040 --> 05:51:10,680
And she goes get pregnant get pregnant get pregnant get pregnant get pregnant.

9462
05:51:10,680 --> 05:51:13,480
And I was gonna remake it and be like.

9463
05:51:13,480 --> 05:51:15,880
Get pregnant get main break get main break get main break.

9464
05:51:15,880 --> 05:51:17,240
But I can't say it that fast.

9465
05:51:18,680 --> 05:51:21,800
But I was gonna add like plap sound effects and all that and the music.

9466
05:51:21,800 --> 05:51:24,200
And like plap plap and then do my hypnosis thing.

9467
05:51:25,000 --> 05:51:27,800
Also that timer stuff can be moved by holding O and dragging it.

9468
05:51:28,520 --> 05:51:31,080
I'll leave it in the top corner where it belongs for now.

9469
05:51:35,000 --> 05:51:36,200
Mm mm mm mm.

9470
05:51:39,880 --> 05:51:42,120
Was that the one by someone underscore?

9471
05:51:42,120 --> 05:51:45,160
It was um it got like 6,000 likes.

9472
05:51:45,160 --> 05:51:47,880
And I was like oh my god I want to make a rifling version of that.

9473
05:51:49,000 --> 05:51:51,640
So I was like get main break get main break get main break get main break.

9474
05:51:53,160 --> 05:51:53,400
Yeah.

9475
05:51:56,360 --> 05:52:00,840
Oh I keep going to click on the banker but she's not gone.

9476
05:52:00,840 --> 05:52:02,440
I don't need to do that.

9477
05:52:02,440 --> 05:52:04,200
God there's so much going on over there.

9478
05:52:04,760 --> 05:52:05,800
You can perish it.

9479
05:52:10,840 --> 05:52:12,040
I think I remember seeing that.

9480
05:52:12,040 --> 05:52:15,240
Yeah I like went pretty viral and I saw it and I was like oh my god I want a rifling version.

9481
05:52:15,240 --> 05:52:17,000
So I'm gonna put my hypno eyes on and stuff.

9482
05:52:17,560 --> 05:52:19,880
I'd be all hey pregnant go pregnant go.

9483
05:52:19,880 --> 05:52:21,480
Well I'm not pregnant in your case.

9484
05:52:23,320 --> 05:52:24,680
Get your boy pregnant.

9485
05:52:25,960 --> 05:52:26,760
Not really for me.

9486
05:52:29,240 --> 05:52:31,560
Astrony you can't imagine what's happening by the way.

9487
05:52:31,560 --> 05:52:32,840
Wait why what do you mean?

9488
05:52:37,000 --> 05:52:38,360
What does that mean?

9489
05:52:38,360 --> 05:52:39,800
Why does that sound like a veiled?

9490
05:52:41,480 --> 05:52:41,880
Truth.

9491
05:52:45,240 --> 05:52:48,280
I mean we're almost at 4k water.

9492
05:52:48,280 --> 05:52:50,280
We've just done about 500 there.

9493
05:52:51,720 --> 05:52:57,000
I'm wondering if I can do it in one sitting and just let the XP pop and then I'll be satisfied with that.

9494
05:52:57,960 --> 05:53:00,840
Oh maybe.

9495
05:53:00,840 --> 05:53:02,840
Maybe baby if I don't mess it up.

9496
05:53:03,800 --> 05:53:04,120
What?

9497
05:53:05,400 --> 05:53:07,400
Hello I want to grab that.

9498
05:53:07,400 --> 05:53:08,600
Oh my god.

9499
05:53:09,960 --> 05:53:12,200
Riflings are such sugar daddies.

9500
05:53:13,000 --> 05:53:15,960
That was 7 million just hanging out on a table.

9501
05:53:17,960 --> 05:53:19,960
I literally actually did a gilded.

9502
05:53:19,960 --> 05:53:23,480
Someone got into dropping a gilded freaking plate armor.

9503
05:53:23,640 --> 05:53:27,640
People are storming the channel.

9504
05:53:28,440 --> 05:53:29,720
Are y'all winning, Astrony?

9505
05:53:32,200 --> 05:53:33,320
Get in pregnant.

9506
05:53:33,320 --> 05:53:34,840
Yeah I've never really been.

9507
05:53:36,280 --> 05:53:39,480
I mean I'll cater to everyone but it's not wrong for me.

9508
05:53:42,360 --> 05:53:47,080
I'm pretty sure the viral version was either they get pregnant by it or get me pregnant.

9509
05:53:49,240 --> 05:53:52,040
No Shiori no it wasn't that one.

9510
05:53:53,640 --> 05:53:54,840
I didn't see the Shiori.

9511
05:53:54,840 --> 05:54:01,800
I know what the Shiori one is but I definitely must have seen it from the other chick.

9512
05:54:09,240 --> 05:54:10,120
I want to grab that.

9513
05:54:11,560 --> 05:54:12,840
Astrony reading my words.

9514
05:54:13,960 --> 05:54:14,600
I want to grab that.

9515
05:54:14,600 --> 05:54:15,480
Let me shake your hand.

9516
05:54:17,880 --> 05:54:19,800
I'm already here lord of storms.

9517
05:54:23,720 --> 05:54:31,160
I'm just going to check when Azur comes.

9518
05:54:32,280 --> 05:54:33,480
What was that noise?

9519
05:54:33,480 --> 05:54:37,000
Why is that a look away for a millisecond and there's lots of weird noises going on?

9520
05:54:37,640 --> 05:54:38,280
Hold on.

9521
05:54:38,280 --> 05:54:38,920
Hold on.

9522
05:54:38,920 --> 05:54:40,280
Let me check when Azur comes on.

9523
05:54:41,560 --> 05:54:42,360
Subscriptions.

9524
05:54:44,680 --> 05:54:45,320
Azur.

9525
05:54:45,320 --> 05:54:48,200
Why does it not say Azur is coming up next?

9526
05:54:48,200 --> 05:54:49,160
That's so annoying.

9527
05:54:51,960 --> 05:54:52,600
Oh no!

9528
05:54:52,600 --> 05:54:53,320
Oh my freaking...

9529
05:54:54,600 --> 05:54:55,400
Wait I'm going to do it.

9530
05:54:55,400 --> 05:54:55,960
I'm going to do it.

9531
05:54:55,960 --> 05:54:56,520
I'm going to do it.

9532
05:55:02,520 --> 05:55:05,240
How could I forget the Wayne fermentation?

9533
05:55:05,960 --> 05:55:07,880
How could I have been so silly?

9534
05:55:08,840 --> 05:55:10,520
I just wanted to make sure when Azur was coming on.

9535
05:55:11,640 --> 05:55:13,000
Level 72.

9536
05:55:13,000 --> 05:55:13,960
Right I'll take it.

9537
05:55:13,960 --> 05:55:14,920
Level 72.

9538
05:55:16,520 --> 05:55:18,040
That's actually not that bad though.

9539
05:55:19,080 --> 05:55:20,040
I'm quite happy with that.

9540
05:55:23,000 --> 05:55:25,320
198k?

9541
05:55:25,320 --> 05:55:26,520
198k?

9542
05:55:26,520 --> 05:55:27,160
Seriously?

9543
05:55:29,400 --> 05:55:29,880
Whoops.

9544
05:55:31,320 --> 05:55:32,440
That was good though.

9545
05:55:35,080 --> 05:55:35,960
That was really good.

9546
05:55:35,960 --> 05:55:38,680
Okay maybe Wayne's is the way to go because

9547
05:55:40,200 --> 05:55:41,080
big if true.

9548
05:55:42,840 --> 05:55:45,400
And I'm not even finished fermenting all the wine that I've got.

9549
05:55:46,440 --> 05:55:46,840
Hold on.

9550
05:55:46,840 --> 05:55:50,600
I'm going to put the heating on because I'm absolutely frozen in my room.

9551
05:55:53,160 --> 05:55:53,660
Oh.

9552
05:55:58,680 --> 05:55:59,080
God.

9553
05:56:00,680 --> 05:56:02,360
It's 15 degrees.

9554
05:56:02,360 --> 05:56:04,520
How am I supposed to survive in these conditions?

9555
05:56:05,640 --> 05:56:14,040
Yeah apparently um Australian I rent um but oh where my key?

9556
05:56:14,040 --> 05:56:14,520
Hold on.

9557
05:56:14,520 --> 05:56:15,160
Cable?

9558
05:56:15,160 --> 05:56:15,640
Cable?

9559
05:56:15,640 --> 05:56:16,360
Hold on.

9560
05:56:16,360 --> 05:56:16,920
Okay I've got it.

9561
05:56:16,920 --> 05:56:17,160
I've got it.

9562
05:56:19,160 --> 05:56:22,360
I just I just popped the last into this 73.

9563
05:56:22,360 --> 05:56:25,480
I would have jumped three levels if I managed to do one more batch.

9564
05:56:25,480 --> 05:56:26,040
All right hold on.

9565
05:56:26,040 --> 05:56:28,280
Let's see what's going on with my Azura Deleu.

9566
05:56:29,000 --> 05:56:31,080
I thought she is coming up.

9567
05:56:31,080 --> 05:56:31,560
Oh my god.

9568
05:56:32,120 --> 05:56:33,320
At the Ura.

9569
05:56:33,320 --> 05:56:34,440
Please spell correctly.

9570
05:56:35,960 --> 05:56:36,600
There she is.

9571
05:56:38,200 --> 05:56:39,720
There she is.

9572
05:56:39,720 --> 05:56:42,040
Oh literally in T minus two minutes.

9573
05:56:42,760 --> 05:56:47,400
Um Azura is playing a absolutely precious game called Shrey.

9574
05:56:47,400 --> 05:56:52,120
I have not yet had the pleasure to play it but it looks bloody good yeah.

9575
05:56:53,160 --> 05:57:00,760
Yeah if you've made the 1000 wins it would have been a too much game.

9576
05:57:01,640 --> 05:57:04,600
Listen to Strony Yat while at work and produce product to me.

9577
05:57:04,600 --> 05:57:13,320
I feel like I'm like um uh I feel like I would distract being like at work and stuff.

9578
05:57:15,400 --> 05:57:20,760
Honestly honestly if I had an office I feel like I'd be like one of them

9579
05:57:20,760 --> 05:57:24,120
bosses that couldn't just give her rats arms.

9580
05:57:24,120 --> 05:57:28,920
I'm like as long as you do the work go home early doesn't bother me none.

9581
05:57:31,000 --> 05:57:36,200
Seems like whenever someone gets a manager type job they think they call the shots and it was like

9582
05:57:36,200 --> 05:57:38,120
no you're at the mercy of your workers.

9583
05:57:38,680 --> 05:57:40,120
Let's let's not get it twisted.

9584
05:57:41,000 --> 05:57:42,200
Let's not get it twisted.

9585
05:57:44,360 --> 05:57:45,800
Are you doing Marshmallow later?

9586
05:57:45,800 --> 05:57:48,040
Yeah of course I'll do Marshmallow more than happy to.

9587
05:57:48,920 --> 05:57:53,800
I would I'll do it when we do when we go back to the fish because unfortunately the

9588
05:57:53,800 --> 05:58:00,200
wanes require a lot more um like fast clicking.

9589
05:58:01,000 --> 05:58:06,440
Every time I move to the left I need to too and I'm I'm getting nervous.

9590
05:58:06,440 --> 05:58:14,520
Now not to be a minger but when I tried to go to toilet but nothing came out and I'm worried

9591
05:58:14,520 --> 05:58:17,960
I'm gonna have to go toilet in the middle of the stream but I don't want to go toilet.

9592
05:58:21,400 --> 05:58:26,360
I normally take a shower after I I don't I don't.

9593
05:58:28,680 --> 05:58:31,160
Felt oh my most what time's come in here.

9594
05:58:32,200 --> 05:58:35,720
Oops but yes I will do Marshmallow it's not problem.

9595
05:58:38,200 --> 05:58:40,600
Use your gamer bucket please do not ever type again.

9596
05:58:41,160 --> 05:58:43,320
Gamer bucket.

9597
05:58:43,320 --> 05:58:45,560
Now pee bottles I can tolerate.

9598
05:58:46,440 --> 05:58:49,320
Gamer bucket like Eric Cartman style.

9599
05:58:49,880 --> 05:58:52,440
Ma'am ma'am I need to use the bathroom.

9600
05:58:56,760 --> 05:58:58,280
You gotta go for a job eh.

9601
05:59:00,040 --> 05:59:01,320
The birthing girl.

9602
05:59:01,320 --> 05:59:06,440
My team leader in quality assurance didn't solve their their premiums since months because

9603
05:59:06,440 --> 05:59:09,320
the workers are motivated and didn't get trained properly.

9604
05:59:09,400 --> 05:59:16,200
Literally just because you in the manager position does not make you a leader.

9605
05:59:18,360 --> 05:59:22,440
Magi playing RuneScape into N.E.24 without uh

9606
05:59:25,000 --> 05:59:27,960
refunds you know

9607
05:59:31,800 --> 05:59:32,920
the gamer bucket.

9608
05:59:40,280 --> 05:59:45,480
On a scale of 1 to 10 how jealous are you of men's ability to use gamer ball?

9609
05:59:50,840 --> 05:59:57,720
I don't think it applies to me because I have acidic like main stinks.

9610
05:59:59,560 --> 06:00:01,720
Actually I probably should have mentioned that to the doctor.

9611
06:00:02,920 --> 06:00:05,320
Eep forgot to mention it what was that?

9612
06:00:05,320 --> 06:00:08,840
Also if you try to do a fast knight named Fletch and your wrist would die after a few

9613
06:00:08,840 --> 06:00:10,520
minutes unless you learned mouse pee.

9614
06:00:11,400 --> 06:00:14,760
I don't have that kind of mouse I have up and down on the mouse that's it.

9615
06:00:18,840 --> 06:00:21,480
Good dinner ruined sorry.

9616
06:00:23,960 --> 06:00:30,840
Sorry okay I think we're gonna have to swap back to the swordfish just for a little bit

9617
06:00:30,840 --> 06:00:33,560
because this is like one after the other.

9618
06:00:34,520 --> 06:00:41,560
Your face your face melts off kind of acid yeah mouse keys are button presses.

9619
06:00:50,200 --> 06:00:55,240
However we just bought the levels and I'll just commentate over oh my god you leveled up congrats.

9620
06:00:56,440 --> 06:00:58,440
I'm kidding by the way we're not bought.

9621
06:00:59,320 --> 06:01:04,120
I don't know how bad the bots are in runescape I heard they're really bad in world of warcraft

9622
06:01:05,400 --> 06:01:12,200
but bots apparently keep prices low in cheeky runescape so I'm not really sure.

9623
06:01:14,600 --> 06:01:17,480
Gamer girl uses pee bollies more a lot.

9624
06:01:18,600 --> 06:01:21,560
Oh I'm already in trouble by youtube actually I should check that.

9625
06:01:22,120 --> 06:01:25,080
Wait no I'll check it when we're doing the fish.

9626
06:01:25,080 --> 06:01:28,280
Not while fest is banning the ways.

9627
06:01:28,280 --> 06:01:32,680
I will check it after I've done this batch of wines.

9628
06:01:41,960 --> 06:01:44,840
Oh yeah it's really bad and wow all versions.

9629
06:01:46,120 --> 06:01:50,280
I just know some people say like oh the reason why the bots are actually good is because they

9630
06:01:50,280 --> 06:01:55,640
keep everything low price because they're like trying to fight over the same resources type thing.

9631
06:01:57,880 --> 06:02:00,920
And I was like honestly that is actually valid feedback.

9632
06:02:01,800 --> 06:02:08,120
Right we'll go down to 5000 water and then I'm gonna swap to fish just to like use up all the

9633
06:02:08,120 --> 06:02:15,160
fish because it's just in there and I'll read some marshmallow q&a's if you want to say something.

9634
06:02:15,960 --> 06:02:29,400
Sorry I know I'm not doing that in a good way but there are bots that kill some of the

9635
06:02:29,400 --> 06:02:32,600
hardest bosses in the game in the tens of thousands.

9636
06:02:36,440 --> 06:02:39,400
Yeah bots keep runescape economy from high for inflating.

9637
06:02:40,280 --> 06:02:48,280
I can't believe it. Capitalism wins again even in my video games and I can't escape.

9638
06:02:50,120 --> 06:02:55,560
Didn't they just catch some bots and wow by placing a single row?

9639
06:02:55,560 --> 06:02:58,040
Oh wait I seem to remember something like that.

9640
06:02:59,160 --> 06:02:59,960
I think you're right.

9641
06:03:01,720 --> 06:03:05,400
Also just gold farmers who aren't bots they just sell the money later on.

9642
06:03:05,400 --> 06:03:13,400
Oh yeah you can like buy like in-game currency with like actual money so like you get given the

9643
06:03:13,400 --> 06:03:20,760
money or something. Because of the there's like a Venezuelan meme so the Venezuelan

9644
06:03:22,200 --> 06:03:32,200
Venezuelan economy went to shambles and basically it became profitable for

9645
06:03:33,000 --> 06:03:39,800
those individuals to play runescape and sell the in-game currency or something.

9646
06:03:39,800 --> 06:03:43,720
Yeah my brain's like kind of remembering that. They sell it on a third party site for

9647
06:03:43,720 --> 06:03:52,600
anyone who's like hmm which is against T.O.S. oh okay okay okay I don't know okay I guess it's

9648
06:03:52,600 --> 06:03:58,040
against T.O.S. on World of Warcraft as well then with that watch it. That could be wrong I don't know.

9649
06:03:58,440 --> 06:04:05,240
Azura has gone live okay if there's any bleeding hearts or any

9650
06:04:05,240 --> 06:04:11,240
reeflings who are needing a break from the winemaking. Azura Dooley has gone live.

9651
06:04:11,240 --> 06:04:22,360
She is playing a game called Stray and she's a cat and I'm not a goat so if you want to see

9652
06:04:22,360 --> 06:04:36,760
Neko Azura you know where to go. Mods I give you permission and thank you for linking my gen mates

9653
06:04:36,760 --> 06:04:49,560
when they go live because we love my gen mates. I think Azura might actually hit 4k you know

9654
06:04:49,560 --> 06:04:54,760
that I think she's about to teeter over 4k. She's teetering whilst I am on her

9655
06:04:54,760 --> 06:04:59,160
tittering this thank you I'll be here all week that's absolutely awful I'm not I was going to

9656
06:04:59,160 --> 06:05:05,000
repeat it in order to do that brimps but no that was absolutely awful and I should be ashamed of myself

9657
06:05:05,240 --> 06:05:06,440
truly.

9658
06:05:15,400 --> 06:05:24,280
Yeah she's at 4k oh that's fantastic. Soon Ace will be 4k as well and

9659
06:05:26,680 --> 06:05:31,800
I'll get her to make some more adorable little shorts and I'll put some money in it and then

9660
06:05:31,800 --> 06:05:38,920
she can celebrate her 4k as well. Gen mate love. Gen mate love.

9661
06:05:47,240 --> 06:05:52,200
Oh no this has put me to sleep this is a terrible idea my room's getting nice and warm and

9662
06:05:52,200 --> 06:05:57,480
runescape's so soothing and the reeflings in the back are so hypnotic hold on a minute

9663
06:05:57,480 --> 06:06:05,320
you guys put me to sleep hold on a minute I've just had a tea which has caffeine and

9664
06:06:05,320 --> 06:06:13,000
cola has caffeine in it as well oh but it'd be so nice to sleep we're doing nap in stream you

ASMR okay it's hot tub ASMR relax cheeky hot tub I am back spitting on the beat

9672
06:07:21,000 --> 06:07:27,800
but yes I am suddenly feeling very tired I think I told you guys my sleep's been a bit

9673
06:07:27,800 --> 06:07:35,000
hair wire but I finally got an eight hour sleep last night but I woke up 30 minutes before stream

9674
06:07:35,000 --> 06:07:42,440
and I tried to did a a brick cutting fart and then nothing sorry and then nothing happened

9675
06:07:42,440 --> 06:07:51,000
I'm like oh no did it pop I wasn't paying attention sugar it popped oh no I'm sorry where were we

9676
06:07:51,000 --> 06:07:55,880
oh we're like getting pretty close though oh this is so much faster though

9677
06:07:58,200 --> 06:08:02,760
hot tub stream should just be me and be me and a fish tank honestly that's actually pretty

9678
06:08:03,160 --> 06:08:04,120
great I might steal that

9679
06:08:09,400 --> 06:08:14,920
okay we'll get to the next level with wine and then I'm gonna have to go swordfish

9680
06:08:16,360 --> 06:08:22,760
and marshmallows because I'm I'm I don't know why I'm getting hit with a wave of

9681
06:08:22,760 --> 06:08:29,560
sleepiness but I'm getting hit with a wave of sleepiness I'm sure she's the other I put the

9682
06:08:29,560 --> 06:08:37,400
heating on I have made a greatest error ever I'm not gonna make it I'm funny oh yeah that's

9683
06:08:37,400 --> 06:08:42,280
what I was saying I would absolutely love to do like one of those sleeping ASMR streams the problem

9684
06:08:42,280 --> 06:08:51,320
is I fart in my sleep so it's not gonna go down well all the amaranth mute I think amaranth muted

9685

9686
06:08:59,720 --> 06:09:07,800

9687
06:09:08,360 --> 06:09:13,400
so how are these girls doing like sleep with me ASMR streams and stuff I'm like how

9688
06:09:13,560 --> 06:09:23,960
do it anyway no because what happens if it just sounds really bad what happens if they don't like

9689
06:09:23,960 --> 06:09:36,200
my toots we all have our special sleep condition I love biological weapons during my sleep my

9690
06:09:36,200 --> 06:09:40,520
weapons of masters but I don't think anyone would complain brah I ain't no woman here

9691
06:09:46,280 --> 06:09:52,040
yeah I don't I don't know and like I talk in my sleep as well my mom used to get really freaked

9692
06:09:52,040 --> 06:09:58,040
out with it I actually freaked out my gran one time I had a sleepover at her house and apparently

9693
06:09:58,040 --> 06:10:08,840
like I sat up really quickly and and my eyes were like wide open she said but I didn't remember

9694
06:10:08,840 --> 06:10:14,360
any of it and and when I woke up I was like I don't know why I'm so tired because I felt like

9695
06:10:14,360 --> 06:10:22,120
I slept really well because when I have sleepover my gran we just shared the bed and she was like

9696
06:10:22,120 --> 06:10:27,480
strongy you were sleep like you sat up and you're it's not sleep it's a sleepwalking if you don't

9697
06:10:27,480 --> 06:10:36,280
move anywhere I was sleep sat up basic clown would be extra tingles added on

9698
06:10:38,280 --> 06:10:47,240
um but yeah like I did it to my mom as well and she doesn't like it um but that didn't I don't know

9699
06:10:47,240 --> 06:10:52,200
maybe you got you maybe you talking you'll sleep too and you don't know if it's sleepwalking if

9700
06:10:52,200 --> 06:10:57,400
you're awake but you're asleep okay the walking is just more obvious version okay we're learning

9701
06:10:57,960 --> 06:11:02,600
well then they'll judge you while you sleep and when you wake up it'll be rooflings only yeah

9702
06:11:03,720 --> 06:11:08,600
get filtered get filtered get filtered get wrapped get wrapped get wrapped um

9704
06:11:11,800 --> 06:11:18,760
I just think I sleep badly no talking or walking yeah I never remember my dreams but because

9705
06:11:18,760 --> 06:11:24,680
I have an alarm set to make sure I'm awake for streams I seem to violently like wake up in the

9706
06:11:24,680 --> 06:11:32,520
middle of a dream um which is a rather cutie it's honest that it's rather cutie

9707

9708
06:11:43,000 --> 06:11:45,640
know why

9709
06:11:46,680 --> 06:11:53,640
I don't know why Runely isn't tracking my wanes but tracks everything else

9710
06:11:57,080 --> 06:11:57,640
stinky

9711
06:12:01,720 --> 06:12:06,680

9712
06:12:07,240 --> 06:12:14,520
did you ever have sleep paralysis I have never suffered from sleep paralysis once

9713
06:12:14,520 --> 06:12:20,920
I've had people explain it to me I've never had it in my entire life they say it's when

9714
06:12:21,880 --> 06:12:28,040
your body is still asleep but you wake up in your mind but because you're in a certain phase of

9715
06:12:28,040 --> 06:12:33,480
sleep things become really scary um and like you realize that you're paralyzed and stuff

9716
06:12:36,680 --> 06:12:45,320
um so it's rough oh I shouldn't have put the heating on I'm going in again

being aquatic creatures do we reef flings when you need to be moisturized asking for

9731
06:14:25,960 --> 06:14:30,040
a really important time to pick a question I don't know I feel like we just kind of like

9732
06:14:30,040 --> 06:14:34,680
hydrate instantly when we enter the water again like we're fine to be out of the water but it's

9733
06:14:34,680 --> 06:14:38,360
just where we are the incoming

9734
06:14:38,920 --> 06:14:48,680
the incoming pregnancy is more in lore about how you gave us the girls really gets the

9735

enjoyer in me going but are we going to get a dedicated audio for it I like how vealour felt

9737
06:15:07,400 --> 06:15:13,880

9738
06:15:14,520 --> 06:15:22,760
give me five babies no more no less that's all I asked I wrote a little thing on my alternative

9739
06:15:22,760 --> 06:15:29,800
twitter only 59k winds to go brah brah

9740
06:15:30,360 --> 06:15:38,280
I'm I'm touching my tentacles and right now I do it out of principle but if I ain't even

9741
06:15:38,280 --> 06:15:40,200
saying anything that's like good

9742
06:15:44,920 --> 06:15:51,960
uh hold on I need to read this one um hi strongy a few things I wanted to say and ask most of the

9743
06:15:51,960 --> 06:15:56,600
questions are for later than the line so feel free to disregard them if you need to be

9744
06:15:57,480 --> 06:16:04,840
uh first I wanted to say you and other girls really helped keep me sane last week it was tough

9745
06:16:04,840 --> 06:16:09,400
but you made it through oh that's fantastic congrats I don't know if you're a riefling so I won't call

9746
06:16:09,400 --> 06:16:21,160
you riefling um would you ever consider opening a PO box I am so sorry however um I've discouraged

9747
06:16:21,160 --> 06:16:31,400
all girls uh from a PO box opening due to the fact that um air trackers are I think no I'm not

9748
06:16:31,400 --> 06:16:36,840
accusing you of putting an air tracker in it or anything like that uh the safety reasons just

9749
06:16:36,840 --> 06:16:44,840
completely outweigh the fund that could be in a PO box I do apologize what is a box a PO box is

9750
06:16:44,840 --> 06:16:51,400
like a setup location where you can send packages and and I would go retrieve them but for safety

9751
06:16:51,400 --> 06:16:57,320
reasons I can't have any of that so I am so sorry but thank you for being interested in sending us

9752
06:16:57,320 --> 06:17:04,040
stuff um have you ever considered making a music playlist of your fave songs so rieflings can listen

9753
06:17:04,040 --> 06:17:12,600
to offline um if you thought something you guys won yeah my current song that I'm addicted to

9754
06:17:12,840 --> 06:17:19,160
is by Eust who's Dutch and the song goes

9755
06:17:29,960 --> 06:17:36,200
that's what I'm addicted to right now I like smashed out like five ASMR collabs to that song

9756
06:17:36,200 --> 06:17:39,160
I just had it on repeat I'm so sorry if it's not your kind of thing

9758
06:17:50,360 --> 06:17:55,320
of bread is moving in my insides which means I might have to go for a break very shortly hold on

9759
06:17:55,320 --> 06:18:06,040

so I can you know stand up and not suffocate you all right we'll do it in the ASMR but how about that

9776
06:20:10,600 --> 06:20:17,960

after it you like get a special prize or something sacrifices mama

9778
06:20:33,320 --> 06:20:37,320
hey stroney you said gen 2 is cooking does that mean we don't have a chance and there won't be

9779
06:20:37,320 --> 06:20:46,920
additions oh no sorry uh no when I say gen 2 is cooking it took a year for concept art model

9780
06:20:47,720 --> 06:20:55,400
assets emotes all of that it takes a year to do that kind of stuff we're at the stage of going

9781
06:20:55,400 --> 06:21:02,200
all the way back to the start all the way back to one paragraph about this girl all the way back to

9782
06:21:02,200 --> 06:21:08,040
right what are the names all the way back like we're all the way back there so please don't there's

9783
06:21:08,040 --> 06:21:19,880
no one um I said in the exposing veiler stream no one got a call back um there is no call back

9784
06:21:20,920 --> 06:21:30,680
there is no mean um take off your clothes gen 2 is ban here no it is um we're all the way back

9785
06:21:30,680 --> 06:21:39,400
thankfully I am not on the heavier side of um development when it comes to names or whatever

9786
06:21:39,400 --> 06:21:45,240
but it's like we're now going all the way back um especially like the lower art I need to think

9787
06:21:45,240 --> 06:21:55,000
of the story and uh but that's what I mean when I say we're all the way back to gen 2 um

9788
06:21:55,800 --> 06:22:02,520
uh or did you just mean characters then and models and niches and such yes that's what I meant sorry

9789
06:22:02,520 --> 06:22:11,480
just uh scare you no I will it'll be the exact same pro there's no date there's no date um which

9790
06:22:11,480 --> 06:22:16,920
I'm so freaking glad there's no date because making a deadline is horrible and I don't ever want to

9791
06:22:16,920 --> 06:22:24,440
have a deadline like that again um the announcements for that kind of stuff only will come out when

9792
06:22:24,440 --> 06:22:33,640
things are ready and uh as I said the generation one will be up for a year before gen 2 even like

9793
06:22:35,000 --> 06:22:40,520
yeah it'll be at least a year like after do you know I mean I don't know if that means something

9794
06:22:40,520 --> 06:22:45,960
good night I'ma turn in please rest well sorry I'm a star too busy rambling sleep well those of you

9795
06:22:45,960 --> 06:22:54,680
who need to sleep um but yes uh it's it took a year for development it is not quick it's not easy

9796
06:22:54,680 --> 06:22:58,920
it's not fast um and especially when you've got artists that love to go over deadlines um

9797
06:23:01,640 --> 06:23:07,320
it makes everything an absolute nightmare um I kind of said a wee bit of it on the

9798
06:23:07,320 --> 06:23:14,840
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood stream I had planned everything to occur within certain months

9799
06:23:15,640 --> 06:23:22,760
and then everything went to because artists all unanimously went over deadlines so if you're

9800
06:23:22,760 --> 06:23:29,000
an artist that works with us look I'm not mad at you everyone did it so you know you know it's fine

9801
06:23:29,720 --> 06:23:40,120
but uh everyone went over and it made everything happen in May when May was supposed to be

9802
06:23:40,120 --> 06:23:45,480
where I fully focused on getting stuff done for the girls and like we're still kind of picking up

9803
06:23:45,480 --> 06:23:50,120
the pieces like I'm doing stuff I shouldn't really have shouldn't be doing at the stage

9804
06:23:50,120 --> 06:23:56,040
like it was supposed to be handed off or there's supposed to be something else in place um but it

9805
06:23:56,040 --> 06:24:06,680
just uh nightmare nightmare how many marshmallows do you have 850 on the dot actually 850 um

9806
06:24:10,040 --> 06:24:18,120
yes I don't even know how I got on that rant hey I still have two ideas for a gen two

9807
06:24:18,120 --> 06:24:23,960
what would you want to tell us which one two things that I think would be popular a lollipop dragon

9808
06:24:24,120 --> 06:24:31,240
there's no lollipop dragon vtuber's curious to get to do it after the pandora on anything

9809
06:24:32,040 --> 06:24:39,640
also I think an insect girl in the style of a traditional japanese geisha who uses her own

9810
06:24:39,640 --> 06:24:44,600
self to make her clothes be popular that's unique I've not heard that not a bad idea

9811
06:24:49,240 --> 06:24:52,840
uh I think I need a jobby

9812
06:24:55,320 --> 06:24:59,640
I think I need a mute and go hold on it makes me still mix going

9813
06:25:01,640 --> 06:25:07,320
hold on a minute refund uh i've a hydrate and then I'm gonna go for a few minutes

9814
06:25:10,360 --> 06:25:15,160
I think there's a loaf of bread in the oven if you know what I'm saying hold on any open up

9815
06:25:15,160 --> 06:25:19,640
my other bottle of water to hydrate you need hydrate to make it come out like easy

9816
06:25:22,920 --> 06:25:26,840
I'd mute so we can hear you screaming from the bathroom you scream when you take a job

9817
06:25:31,800 --> 06:25:37,640
I'm so sorry I can like feel my my my bills shifting about it and I'm like I don't

9818
06:25:40,600 --> 06:25:47,080
okay let's do one more bank run and I'll start cooking and then I'll mute because uh the toilet

9819
06:25:47,080 --> 06:25:51,400
is like right there um and obviously I don't want any

9820
06:25:54,040 --> 06:25:59,720
I don't I don't want that out there okay man you know I've got big heavy dents you know it's

9821
06:25:59,720 --> 06:26:05,160
like a big plop I don't want I don't want my plop.mp3 out there you know what I'm saying

9822
06:26:05,240 --> 06:26:09,880
so I'm gonna go make a loaf of bread uh I'll be a minute or so I don't I don't really know how

9823
06:26:09,880 --> 06:26:21,080
long it's gonna take um but please enjoy I apologize for this interruption to your usual broadcast

9824
06:26:35,160 --> 06:26:51,080
so

9825
06:29:05,160 --> 06:29:33,500
Are you squiddling me right now?

9826
06:30:33,500 --> 06:30:44,220
There was no loaf of bread to be had, but I took it again.

9827
06:30:44,220 --> 06:30:49,660
I'm also ovulating like crazy, just thought you should know.

9828
06:30:50,160 --> 06:30:55,160
Bro, the amount of ink that just came out of me, holy shit.

9829
06:30:59,160 --> 06:31:03,160
So I don't mind talking about this because I've got hands on chicks.

9830
06:31:03,160 --> 06:31:11,160
When whammin' ovulate, you get a clear ink that comes out of you, produced naturally.

9831
06:31:11,160 --> 06:31:14,160
And I just had that and I was like, what?

9832
06:31:14,660 --> 06:31:21,660
So I'm like, well, now's the best time to send any bibbutes.

9833
06:31:21,660 --> 06:31:32,160
I had no idea, but that makes sense why I'm tired because I just want, you know, my body wants one thing.

9834
06:31:32,160 --> 06:31:42,160
I have over 2,000 burnt pork, bitch, that was so cool.

9835
06:31:42,160 --> 06:31:44,160
Good to know.

9836
06:31:44,160 --> 06:31:46,160
That made my neurons burn.

9837
06:31:46,160 --> 06:31:48,160
Bro, I wish I could have shown you that, honestly.

9838
06:31:48,160 --> 06:31:50,160
I was like, what, an error?

9839
06:31:51,160 --> 06:32:05,160
Yes, I don't know what's happening with my butt though.

9840
06:32:05,160 --> 06:32:10,160
I need to go number two, but nothing's happening.

9841
06:32:10,160 --> 06:32:12,160
You like receiving bibbutes?

9842
06:32:12,160 --> 06:32:16,160
Go, go.

9843
06:32:16,160 --> 06:32:19,160
I am down atrocious, I volunteer.

9844
06:32:19,160 --> 06:32:21,160
Hey guys, do you want to make Gen 2 right now?

9845
06:32:21,160 --> 06:32:23,160
I'm ovulating.

9846
06:32:23,160 --> 06:32:27,160
Oh my god, we can just say that every time I ovulate, I'll be like, Gen 2.

9847
06:32:27,160 --> 06:32:29,160
Come on.

9848
06:32:29,160 --> 06:32:31,160
Oh, good to know.

9849
06:32:34,160 --> 06:32:37,160
Humans are just monkeys with fanfare shoes though.

9850
06:32:37,160 --> 06:32:39,160
Oh, thoughts.

9851
06:32:39,160 --> 06:32:41,160
Not quite, close enough.

9852
06:32:41,160 --> 06:32:44,160
But a few more evolutionary factors in there.

9853
06:32:44,160 --> 06:32:50,160
Multiply, refling, produce, feature, activity.

9854
06:32:50,160 --> 06:32:54,160
Sorry, I'm stuttering.

9855
06:32:54,160 --> 06:32:57,160
Well, we have over 200 volunteers.

9856
06:32:57,160 --> 06:33:00,160
Hi, volunteers.

9857
06:33:00,160 --> 06:33:04,160
We did it, we're in the, we're in a million XP.

9858
06:33:04,160 --> 06:33:06,160
God, wines are so fast.

9859
06:33:06,160 --> 06:33:11,160
We were, I don't even think we were like, I don't even know what we were at the start of the stream.

9860
06:33:11,160 --> 06:33:15,160
But we're already a million XP, that's fantastic.

9861
06:33:15,160 --> 06:33:21,160
Seriously, we're making, I think the wines really is the vehicle.

9862
06:33:23,160 --> 06:33:25,160
Aw, someone said, thank you for existing.

9863
06:33:25,160 --> 06:33:27,160
You're so awesome, refling.

9864
06:33:27,160 --> 06:33:29,160
Thank you for existing.

9865
06:33:30,160 --> 06:33:32,160
Uh...

9866
06:33:39,160 --> 06:33:43,160
Oh, I don't know, I kind of...

9867
06:33:43,160 --> 06:33:48,160
Someone is currently anonymously editing for the girls, but they don't want any credit.

9868
06:33:48,160 --> 06:33:50,160
But we are gonna upload the videos.

9869
06:33:50,160 --> 06:33:52,160
You don't need to apologize for not subtitling it.

9870
06:33:52,160 --> 06:33:54,160
Subtitling, don't take long on.

9871
06:33:54,160 --> 06:33:56,160
The videos are like, three minutes long.

9872
06:33:57,160 --> 06:34:03,160
So, are the Gen 1 models quintuplets?

9873
06:34:03,160 --> 06:34:09,160
I like to joke that I had the girls in my stomach for like, how long?

9874
06:34:09,160 --> 06:34:10,160
12 months?

9875
06:34:10,160 --> 06:34:13,160
Yeah, I guess 12 months on the dot.

9876
06:34:13,160 --> 06:34:15,160
Nearly there, 5.98.

9877
06:34:15,160 --> 06:34:17,160
Oh my god, I owe you guys so much.

9878
06:34:17,160 --> 06:34:20,160
There's some more videos, I'm not even uploaded the first one.

9879
06:34:21,160 --> 06:34:31,160
Um, I think I'm gonna be too tired after stream though, to edit and upload the first one.

9880
06:34:33,160 --> 06:34:38,160
Oh my god, problems of being an overachiever for the male.

9881
06:34:38,160 --> 06:34:43,160
Have you ever played Metal Gear Solid?

9882
06:34:43,160 --> 06:34:46,160
I don't think I've played it, but I've definitely heard of it.

9883
06:34:47,160 --> 06:34:50,160
Game suggestions, Mad Rat Dead.

9884
06:34:50,160 --> 06:34:53,160
It's a rhythm platform game on Nintendo.

9885
06:34:53,160 --> 06:34:54,160
How odd.

9886
06:34:54,160 --> 06:34:57,160
Creeps, it's a puzzle game with a rare art style.

9887
06:34:57,160 --> 06:35:01,160
The storyline is decent and you can use it to interact with chat if you get stuck.

9888
06:35:01,160 --> 06:35:04,160
I do it like when chat holds my hand through game.

9889
06:35:04,160 --> 06:35:07,160
Uh, how'd you mention SteelSeries during the collab?

9890
06:35:07,160 --> 06:35:09,160
Hopefully it works well for you.

9891
06:35:09,160 --> 06:35:15,160
No, whenever Azura talks to me, I don't know if the other girls can hear Azura.

9892
06:35:15,160 --> 06:35:21,160
Whenever Azura talks to me via Discord, her make always cuts out and can't handle her.

9893
06:35:21,160 --> 06:35:24,160
And I'm like, Azura, get that noise gate off.

9894
06:35:24,160 --> 06:35:26,160
And she's like, I've not got anything on.

9895
06:35:26,160 --> 06:35:29,160
And I'm like, what is, like, what's, what's she's in?

9896
06:35:29,160 --> 06:35:32,160
Cause I can never hear her, I think the other girls can hear her.

9897
06:35:34,160 --> 06:35:38,160
But I can never hear her when we like have a collab on Discord or anything.

9898
06:35:38,160 --> 06:35:42,160
And when she gets excited, it cuts into her even more.

9899
06:35:42,160 --> 06:35:46,160
But I don't know if she has, like, Discord filters on maybe.

9900
06:35:46,160 --> 06:35:49,160
Which is why I'm like, ah, Azura, are you in that SteelSeries?

9901
06:35:49,160 --> 06:35:52,160
Cause I've said to her a few times now, but I'm not annoyed or anything.

9902
06:35:52,160 --> 06:35:55,160
It's more like a meme where I'm like, ah, SteelSeries.

9903
06:35:55,160 --> 06:36:00,160
And someone has sent me a cat box, should it open up?

9904
06:36:00,160 --> 06:36:02,160
Fuck it, I'm feeling risky.

9905
06:36:02,160 --> 06:36:04,160
What is it? It's a picture.

9906
06:36:04,160 --> 06:36:06,160
Whoa! Okay!

9907
06:36:06,160 --> 06:36:09,160
Yep, that's the picture, alright.

9908
06:36:12,160 --> 06:36:16,160
Okay, I'm not, I'm not gonna open up any cat books.

9909
06:36:16,160 --> 06:36:18,160
Uh, links.

9910
06:36:18,160 --> 06:36:20,160
On, while I'm here.

9911
06:36:24,160 --> 06:36:26,160
Okay!

9912
06:36:26,160 --> 06:36:28,160
Okay, Swordfish.

9913
06:36:28,160 --> 06:36:30,160
Swordfish, yes.

9914
06:36:30,160 --> 06:36:32,160
Um...

9915
06:36:32,160 --> 06:36:34,160
Blumow.

9916
06:36:34,160 --> 06:36:36,160
Share it with a class male.

9917
06:36:38,160 --> 06:36:40,160
I, uh, cuddle.

9918
06:36:40,160 --> 06:36:42,160
Are you okay with me using soul smagment?

9919
06:36:42,160 --> 06:36:44,160
Smagment, oh my god.

9920
06:36:44,160 --> 06:36:46,160
I've got cocks on my mind, what the fuck.

9921
06:36:46,160 --> 06:36:50,160
Soul, small segment of the clapping audio for a meme.

9922
06:36:50,160 --> 06:36:52,160
Yeah, sure, if so, would you rather wait?

9923
06:36:52,160 --> 06:36:54,160
Now, um, now you can post it, it's fine, honestly.

9924
06:36:54,160 --> 06:36:57,160
It's cause it's, cause it's gonna be publicly posted.

9925
06:36:57,160 --> 06:37:00,160
It's not, it's not really an issue to make any of the content a meme.

9926
06:37:00,160 --> 06:37:02,160
I'm so sorry, ah, ah, frickin.

9927
06:37:02,160 --> 06:37:06,160
That was, that would poke your eye out, that's all I'm saying.

9928
06:37:06,160 --> 06:37:08,160
That's all I'm gonna leave out, that would poke your eye out.

9929
06:37:08,160 --> 06:37:10,160
Um...

9930
06:37:10,160 --> 06:37:14,160
Oh, she's so damn bad, just like us, real, real.

9931
06:37:14,160 --> 06:37:16,160
Keep being that lovable goofy gibber you are.

9932
06:37:16,160 --> 06:37:18,160
Oh, thank you, Reefling.

9933
06:37:18,160 --> 06:37:20,160
Strony!

9934
06:37:20,160 --> 06:37:22,160
Reefling!

9935
06:37:22,160 --> 06:37:24,160
I listened to the girlfriend begs the whole day tomorrow.

9936
06:37:24,160 --> 06:37:28,160
I remembered you apologizing about no editing as much.

9937
06:37:28,160 --> 06:37:32,160
I think, at least in this case, less editing of mistakes added to the quality.

9938
06:37:32,160 --> 06:37:35,160
I'm so frickin glad you agree, Reefling.

9939
06:37:35,160 --> 06:37:41,160
I have been enjoying, like, not doing scripted stuff and tryharding.

9940
06:37:41,160 --> 06:37:43,160
Um...

9941
06:37:43,160 --> 06:37:45,160
Um...

9942
06:37:45,160 --> 06:37:49,160
Like, I have been enjoying recording ASMR.

9943
06:37:49,160 --> 06:37:53,160
That isn't scripted, and I'm doing it off the top of my head.

9944
06:37:53,160 --> 06:37:54,160
Wait, wait, what do you say?

9945
06:37:54,160 --> 06:37:56,160
There was one part where you seemed to accidentally say,

9946
06:37:56,160 --> 06:38:00,160
let me hold your fireman, then wait, let me hold your hose, Mr. Fireman.

9947
06:38:00,160 --> 06:38:03,160
It felt so natural, cause of how frantic you were becoming.

9948
06:38:03,160 --> 06:38:06,160
Yeah, because I did it all off the top of my head.

9949
06:38:06,160 --> 06:38:08,160
Um...

9950
06:38:08,160 --> 06:38:10,160
I don't know if it was scripted, but you also yawned at one point.

9951
06:38:10,160 --> 06:38:12,160
If it was intentional or ad-lib, it was so natural.

9952
06:38:12,160 --> 06:38:18,160
No, I've been enjoying doing, like, non-hyper-edited, super production of the wazoo.

9953
06:38:18,160 --> 06:38:20,160
I've been enjoying doing, like, such casual...

9954
06:38:20,160 --> 06:38:22,160
Um, it's been so lovely.

9955
06:38:22,160 --> 06:38:24,160
I've been enjoying it thoroughly.

9956
06:38:24,160 --> 06:38:27,160
I really hope you enjoy the first, like, thank you for 1000 subs,

9957
06:38:27,160 --> 06:38:29,160
cause it's just me, me-man.

9958
06:38:29,160 --> 06:38:31,160
Um...

9959
06:38:31,160 --> 06:38:33,160
From work! Ayyy!

9960
06:38:34,160 --> 06:38:36,160
Okay, but how many strongy-hands big was it?

9961
06:38:36,160 --> 06:38:38,160
I mean...

9962
06:38:38,160 --> 06:38:41,160
There wasn't a ruler in the picture, but...

9963
06:38:42,160 --> 06:38:46,160
From the glance I got before I closed it, it was pretty...

9964
06:38:46,160 --> 06:38:48,160
3D knee...

9965
06:38:50,160 --> 06:38:52,160
I laughed so much in that part, aww.

9966
06:38:53,160 --> 06:38:55,160
I don't know if it was scripted or not, but you...

9967
06:38:55,160 --> 06:38:56,160
Or I'll say that...

9968
06:38:56,160 --> 06:38:59,160
If any of it was scripted, that kind of reinforces my point.

9969
06:38:59,160 --> 06:39:03,480
points so much of the audio scripted are not felt natural even the mistakes seemed no no that

9970
06:39:03,480 --> 06:39:09,960
that was just me that's just me being unable to read uh unable to read unable to formulate my

9971
06:39:09,960 --> 06:39:14,840
my thoughts into our proper sentence structure uh i know it was just the meme but it was really fun

9972
06:39:14,840 --> 06:39:20,280
and good i think it would be neat to do the natural style more i i freaking agree i 100%

9973
06:39:20,280 --> 06:39:36,840
i'm doing natural style open natural style as i said we're gonna finish cooking all the swordfish

9974
06:39:36,840 --> 06:39:47,480
and then we'll go back to wine just because wine is so demanding um if you want to help hold the

9975
06:39:47,480 --> 06:39:52,760
hose during a number one does that mean i get to hold you up when you go number one brah i would

9976
06:39:52,760 --> 06:40:02,440
go everywhere if you did that um straw night i felt it's imperative to let you know there's a

9977
06:40:02,440 --> 06:40:10,680
fortnite skin called tropical punch zoe that looks shockingly like you i swear to god if i look like

9978
06:40:10,680 --> 06:40:25,240
a fortnite character if i look like a fortnite uh i can i can cane to see i know what you mean

9979
06:40:25,240 --> 06:40:34,040
with the bows on our head i get it yeah i get it no that's not bad thankfully i don't look too much

9980
06:40:34,040 --> 06:40:46,280
like but i get it would only need to ask once to hold by the way the subtitles were actually fun

9981
06:40:47,320 --> 06:40:53,560
but why didn't you make someone else do them well when i do all that stuff there's like

9982
06:40:54,280 --> 06:40:59,720
no subtitling takes so much time like it's it's just such a waste of money as well because not

9983
06:40:59,800 --> 06:41:07,640
everyone reads the files um until like outsource that work even further is just like oh i'd rather

9984
06:41:07,640 --> 06:41:12,120
just save the money and like spend it on the girls type thing because i could have sent that to an

9985
06:41:12,120 --> 06:41:18,040
editor and i could have sent that to a video like renderer type thing it's just like i'll just do it

9986
06:41:18,040 --> 06:41:19,960
myself you know

9987
06:41:25,640 --> 06:41:31,160

on the topic conspiracy series one game would be a suit to watch you play disco asylum it's

9991
06:41:52,520 --> 06:41:57,880

10005
06:43:25,320 --> 06:43:31,560

10006
06:43:31,560 --> 06:43:33,080
words outside your comfort zone

10007
06:43:33,880 --> 06:43:39,720
hey stroney just wondering when you plan on sitting on my face right now

10008
06:43:41,480 --> 06:43:41,960
lie down

10009
06:43:47,000 --> 06:43:52,040
since ai is blowing up right now any ideas of implementing it in your content

10010
06:43:53,240 --> 06:43:55,000
no and do you even want to

10011
06:44:00,120 --> 06:44:00,520
um

10012
06:44:00,680 --> 06:44:01,180
um

10013
06:44:03,000 --> 06:44:12,280
the only i wouldn't put um ai content like monetize it i don't think that's right i don't

10014
06:44:12,280 --> 06:44:21,160
mind like ai memes of myself or something like that like that's funny um but like actually ai

10015
06:44:21,160 --> 06:44:26,440
content like i wouldn't use ai content on a thumbnail and then earn money from it like i don't think

10016
06:44:27,400 --> 06:44:32,440
i don't think that's very nice because as a content creator like someone can literally you

10017
06:44:32,440 --> 06:44:36,920
know yank your voice and then make money off of it and it was like well why would i do the same

10018
06:44:37,560 --> 06:44:44,760
to someone else like that's not nice you know can you hold it do you think you can handle

10019
06:44:47,480 --> 06:44:53,720
um have you considered trading a chat box from your stream absolutely not are you kidding me that

10020
06:44:53,720 --> 06:44:58,200
all that thing we'll see is use the other hole refling other hole other hole other hole

10021
06:44:59,240 --> 06:45:01,160
that all that chat box is gonna say

10022
06:45:04,520 --> 06:45:09,000
i don't really use marshmallow marshmallow very often if someone wanted to send you a

10023
06:45:09,000 --> 06:45:16,440
bit but how it says oh you do what's called a cat box link and then you send me the link

10024
06:45:16,440 --> 06:45:21,160
and then i look at the link and the rest is history

10025
06:45:28,840 --> 06:45:33,960
asmr booth hypnoscript i've already recorded the asmr booth

10026
06:45:35,240 --> 06:45:45,400
plot which was funny as anything i haven't done too much hypno because of patreon's restrictions

10027
06:45:45,960 --> 06:45:52,760
but i do have a four part series that will go up on the alternative twitter for free because

10028
06:45:52,760 --> 06:45:59,160
it's not welcome and the replacement audio is gonna be my honey cup of tea

10029
06:46:00,760 --> 06:46:09,400
oops sorry i'm losing it i don't know i don't know why i'm like so sleepy after eating i thought

10030
06:46:09,400 --> 06:46:14,840
you're supposed to get energy from food you lied to me will you permanently scramble my

10031
06:46:14,840 --> 06:46:20,600
brain pretty pretty please oh i can't do that you're supposed to be having a good time

10032
06:46:25,560 --> 06:46:34,920
just pinching but hypnosis is a concept make great hypnotic focal point as you sway back

10033
06:46:34,920 --> 06:46:40,680
and forth and bounce off and down have you seen the the derriere vtuber models that you can get

10034
06:46:41,400 --> 06:46:44,840

catbox it curious cat is very broken um so however this japanese website called marshmallow

10054
06:49:21,800 --> 06:49:27,640
isn't broken it's actually very highly functional other than the filters you have to be a smart level

10055
06:49:27,640 --> 06:49:35,240
refling and bypass the filters have you thought of more games you can play in stream snipes with

10128
06:58:58,440 --> 06:59:06,520

10129
06:59:06,520 --> 06:59:14,840

10131
06:59:24,280 --> 06:59:29,000
don't worry the script master has your back that's all i'm saying he he knows the interest of the

10132
06:59:29,080 --> 06:59:38,840
pinpril in and we're gonna try our best to be able to um but he's joining what if you

10133
06:59:38,840 --> 06:59:45,880
want to get comfy in bed and then get oh my god you seen that meme that's like when your sush was

10134
06:59:45,880 --> 06:59:56,120
that when your sushi roll is sad and just take your sushi roll and put her down and base script

10135
06:59:56,120 --> 07:00:01,240
Albre of the script quality is gonna like go up dramatically after the three month mark

10136
07:00:01,240 --> 07:00:07,100
You're gonna know when the script master came into play because you can tell it's like not me writing that shiz anymore

10137
07:00:07,180 --> 07:00:10,180
You're like oh god finally strong. He's not doing it anymore. I

10138
07:00:11,500 --> 07:00:14,180
Say that as if I'm not writing all my own stuff

10139
07:00:14,180 --> 07:00:20,420
But I want to write my own stuff because I'm passionate about it not to say that script master isn't passionate

10140
07:00:20,420 --> 07:00:25,780
But I quite like writing my stuff because it feels it feels more intimate when I can like do it between

10141
07:00:26,120 --> 07:00:32,400
Me and we fling, you know, we do it together and I have you in mind. You are my muse we fling. You are my muse and

10143
07:00:40,520 --> 07:00:41,120
Oh

10144
07:00:41,120 --> 07:00:46,380
That's it when you're when your girlfriend is that Lira in a blanket layer a ruler and then yeah, yeah

10145
07:00:46,380 --> 07:00:48,220
Yeah, that's the one that's me

10146
07:00:48,220 --> 07:00:53,880
Sometimes it's nice being a little bro. Well little bros are for a zero big bros and me

10147
07:00:56,960 --> 07:00:58,960
I

10148
07:00:59,360 --> 07:01:02,800
Yours are exceptionally good. Oh, that's very kind. I I like

10149
07:01:02,800 --> 07:01:07,520
Um, I did have the option to hand over my scripts to someone else

10150
07:01:07,520 --> 07:01:13,680
But I I like doing it between us really need this fire making XP for real for real

10151
07:01:15,560 --> 07:01:17,560
I

10152
07:01:17,600 --> 07:01:25,600
Imagine you and the other girls write their own stuff. There was a hand full of girls who wanted to give their hand at it

10153
07:01:25,840 --> 07:01:33,600
I absolutely did not expect it because um, it's just more time and I don't want the girls like stressing out over that kind of thing

10154
07:01:36,800 --> 07:01:38,800
But yeah, I

10155
07:01:41,480 --> 07:01:45,800
Just don't want to stress the girls out if they want to do it of their own violation

10156
07:01:46,560 --> 07:01:50,840
We all listen and then that's perfect. Did I just hear?

10157
07:01:56,360 --> 07:01:58,360
She's not happy a feather

10158
07:02:00,360 --> 07:02:02,360
and

10159
07:02:02,680 --> 07:02:08,340
Day 10 of eating celery daily is so bad. Oh, no, don't put yourself through celery for that

10160
07:02:08,960 --> 07:02:17,880
Celery is nasty. I've never enjoyed it. I'm sorry. Doesn't matter how much like humus you put on it view a listen by a listen

10161
07:02:18,400 --> 07:02:23,400
Did I just say it funny bullish in bullish in there's no I okay. We're getting there

10162
07:02:24,000 --> 07:02:26,360
Stopped flusterers exactly

10163
07:02:28,440 --> 07:02:30,440
He he oh my goodness

10164
07:02:32,360 --> 07:02:34,480
Violation oh no, now you're getting me confused

10165
07:02:35,680 --> 07:02:43,400
Yeah, I love your scripts on patreon strony. Thank you. I did them off the top of my head myself

10166
07:02:45,120 --> 07:02:47,120
I

10167
07:02:47,240 --> 07:02:52,480
Will be very curious to see what the doughnut song results in I have I

10168
07:02:53,120 --> 07:02:55,920
Imagine the week after the doughnut song concludes

10169
07:02:55,920 --> 07:03:00,800
I will be having very short streams so I can focus on the rewards one at a time

10170
07:03:01,360 --> 07:03:08,000
And I know some agencies had a bit problems trying to handle streaming and getting rewards out

10171
07:03:08,600 --> 07:03:10,600
obviously because I'm such an

10172
07:03:11,120 --> 07:03:12,480
unbelievably

10173
07:03:12,480 --> 07:03:19,560
Bad workaholic or good however you want it good for people who like content content content bad for the actual

10174
07:03:20,720 --> 07:03:28,960
Workaholic themselves because they just non-stop keep going, but I think I definitely am in a position where I can get stuff out

10175
07:03:29,960 --> 07:03:31,960
relatively quick

10176
07:03:32,400 --> 07:03:34,880
Whether that be an audio a collab audio

10177
07:03:37,240 --> 07:03:38,880
Yeah

10178
07:03:38,880 --> 07:03:44,120
Maybe those are good if you want your money from birds. I have a huge backlog of willow logs from doing

10179
07:03:45,960 --> 07:03:49,600
Short streams like 10 hours instead of 12. Mm-hmm

10180
07:03:50,040 --> 07:03:57,360
For me a short stream is two hours, which I think someone said that's literally what the regular stream time is for the average

10181
07:03:57,360 --> 07:03:59,360
Vtuber and I'm like

10182
07:03:59,840 --> 07:04:03,560
Two hours is me like doing stuff in the background

10183
07:04:03,560 --> 07:04:06,640
I'm not being funny like if I have it if you have

10184
07:04:07,000 --> 07:04:10,440
If you look and you see I've done a two-hour stream and nothing else that day

10185
07:04:10,440 --> 07:04:13,000
That means I am doing like so much work in the background

10186
07:04:14,360 --> 07:04:15,800
type thing

10187
07:04:15,800 --> 07:04:20,960
Is that these scrawny cuddles? There's only one of them in this world, baby

10188
07:04:23,120 --> 07:04:28,760
Time to cook through my 3k swordfish literally that's what I'm doing just getting through it

10189
07:04:30,240 --> 07:04:33,520
It takes her two hours just to start playing the game Lamal

10190
07:04:37,200 --> 07:04:39,200
Management got me there hydration chick

10191
07:04:42,640 --> 07:04:44,640
Wow

10192
07:04:46,160 --> 07:04:48,880
Hi scrawny in the most loving way possible

10193
07:04:48,880 --> 07:04:54,480
I want to bury my face in your butt until you pass out while you hmm yourself. You're too hot. Oh

10194
07:04:56,320 --> 07:05:00,680
Just your gentle talk is enough to get me going sometimes when you talk about other hot things

10195
07:05:00,680 --> 07:05:05,880
I need a moment to calm down. Oh my god, we've got me blushing shit

10196
07:05:06,800 --> 07:05:08,800
Stop

10197
07:05:08,800 --> 07:05:10,800
I'm glad I have that control of you

10198
07:05:11,600 --> 07:05:13,600
That power

10199
07:05:14,000 --> 07:05:16,000
Makes me very happy

10200
07:05:16,640 --> 07:05:20,000
Um a bit too happy. I think I take a little bit too much

10201
07:05:20,880 --> 07:05:24,720
Um pleasure from such a thing. Is that terrible?

10202
07:05:29,440 --> 07:05:35,200
Sure do have powers to arrest the boot up. What is this a Windows 95? No because I won't stop yapping

10203
07:05:37,280 --> 07:05:38,480
I

10204
07:05:38,480 --> 07:05:42,320
Love to eat sushi. I could do it for hours. Oh, yeah

10205
07:05:44,080 --> 07:05:46,080
Is that because I'm a cutlery?

10206
07:05:47,760 --> 07:05:52,480
Oh, I keep wanting to freaking make that what does your oh she smell like meme

10207
07:05:53,440 --> 07:05:55,040
because

10208
07:05:55,040 --> 07:05:57,040
the reason is

10209
07:05:59,040 --> 07:06:04,240
Uh, what's the reason oh because I use a lemon scented soap

10210
07:06:04,640 --> 07:06:08,640
I wanted to post it and be like this call fish comes pre-seasoned

10211
07:06:09,360 --> 07:06:12,560
Um, and then I think there's only one other girl that needs to do it

10212
07:06:12,560 --> 07:06:14,960
And then everyone knows what the whole velour smells like

10213
07:06:16,800 --> 07:06:18,800
Six thousand subscribers reached

10214
07:06:19,840 --> 07:06:22,720
What we celebrated 5k

10215
07:06:25,680 --> 07:06:27,680
Oh my gosh

10216
07:06:34,480 --> 07:06:36,480
Ah

10217
07:06:44,720 --> 07:06:48,640
What I'm really excited

10218
07:07:01,120 --> 07:07:03,120
Why is it getting so cold

10219
07:07:05,040 --> 07:07:07,040
I'm so confused. It shouldn't have been

10220
07:07:08,720 --> 07:07:15,760
Let's statistically yeah, it should have only been pushed to 5k people. It's bizarre. I didn't expect that at all

10221
07:07:19,600 --> 07:07:22,960
You have all the power over us. Take more

10222
07:07:24,480 --> 07:07:26,480
Thank you for the tip

10223
07:07:26,960 --> 07:07:28,960
rilke kadmus

10224
07:07:29,360 --> 07:07:31,360
Any rilke kadmus

10225
07:07:31,440 --> 07:07:38,560
Thank you for saying it. I'm so confused. I'm like daddy you make a tweet and be like I can't believe it but in under 24 hours

10226
07:07:40,320 --> 07:07:43,040
The one thing I think I've mentioned this in another stream

10227
07:07:44,000 --> 07:07:48,160
The one thing I do not like about being a vtuber in this context

10228
07:07:48,800 --> 07:07:53,120
Is you have to play the numbered games and you have to play the

10229
07:07:53,920 --> 07:07:55,920
Oh, thank you for this

10230
07:07:57,920 --> 07:08:00,320
Um in terms of like milestones

10231
07:08:01,680 --> 07:08:02,800
Ah

10232
07:08:02,800 --> 07:08:07,680
And it's a hard one to navigate because if you don't say thank you thank you

10233
07:08:08,720 --> 07:08:10,720
You look almost ungrateful

10234
07:08:11,120 --> 07:08:12,640
But if you do

10235
07:08:12,640 --> 07:08:19,360
Say thank you. Thank you. It looks like you're counting and waiting for the next milestone just so you can spam. Thank you. Thank you, you know

10236
07:08:20,240 --> 07:08:21,520
and

10237
07:08:21,520 --> 07:08:23,520
You don't have to say thank you

10238
07:08:24,400 --> 07:08:27,760
Well, the problem is I'm trying to get like

10239
07:08:28,720 --> 07:08:32,480
Gratisom 6k moment. Thank you little wifling. Um

10240
07:08:33,600 --> 07:08:42,720
The thing is like it would be really good to get on vtuber news or any kind of source like that because it brings more attention to the girls in general

10241
07:08:43,840 --> 07:08:45,840
which is why

10242
07:08:45,840 --> 07:08:47,840
it's like

10243
07:08:48,480 --> 07:08:50,480
I don't want people thinking i'm counting

10244
07:08:50,640 --> 07:08:53,360
But what i'm thinking about is the probable

10245
07:08:53,840 --> 07:09:00,240
Like the possibility that it could gain new eyes to the girls because I want nothing for them to succeed

10246
07:09:00,480 --> 07:09:07,280
I've got everything I want right here. I've got my wiflings. We're freaking meman. We've got member streams. We've got multiplayer games

10247
07:09:07,760 --> 07:09:10,000
Uh, we've got a smart the wazoo coming out

10248
07:09:10,000 --> 07:09:15,360
I've got collabs of other vtubers that are willing to interact with me like I've got everything I need

10249
07:09:15,840 --> 07:09:17,840
I'm so freaking happy

10250
07:09:17,920 --> 07:09:21,440
I want the girls to achieve their dreams and the truth of

10251
07:09:22,080 --> 07:09:25,680
Of them achieving their dreams is one to have enough money to be a content creator

10252
07:09:26,160 --> 07:09:30,800
Some of them are looking to move out. Some of them are looking for upgrade equipments on their own. Um

10253
07:09:32,080 --> 07:09:38,160
You know, um, emmy was fantastic. She's already designed her 2.0 model because it feels more like her

10254
07:09:38,720 --> 07:09:39,760
um

10255
07:09:39,760 --> 07:09:46,000
That kind of thing I want the girls to have it some of them wanted 3d models. I wanted them to get it and

10256
07:09:46,960 --> 07:09:51,120
The truth of the matter is in order to get these things

10257
07:09:51,920 --> 07:09:54,320
That there needs to be eyes on the girls

10258
07:09:54,880 --> 07:09:58,640
Um, so I can help them achieve their 3d goals and stuff

10259
07:09:59,040 --> 07:10:02,480
Although someone said that someone was like, what do you mean by the three year mark?

10260
07:10:03,760 --> 07:10:06,640
When I whenever I mentioned the three year mark

10261
07:10:08,080 --> 07:10:11,920
Congrats to whoever leveled up there whenever I mentioned the three year mark

10262
07:10:12,880 --> 07:10:17,520
The reason I say three years is because statistically three years

10263
07:10:18,080 --> 07:10:22,480
And you're done. You're you're persona. You're whatever you want to call it. It may be

10264
07:10:23,600 --> 07:10:26,800
Oh my god, you really look like emmy as well in games. Uh

10265
07:10:28,400 --> 07:10:30,080
The

10266
07:10:30,080 --> 07:10:38,240
Reason why three years is this mysterious number placed on someone's head is because that statistically if you do find success

10267
07:10:38,240 --> 07:10:45,600
By the third year the success goes unless you make you change your content up dramatically

10268
07:10:46,720 --> 07:10:48,960
and the reason I say three years is because

10269
07:10:50,800 --> 07:10:57,040
Remember before you like wait, so strong. He's only got three years relax. Stop doing relax. No

10270
07:10:58,640 --> 07:11:08,160
No, that's not it's very possible that strongy and uh, like once we're all satisfied like I won't stop until you guys

10271
07:11:08,320 --> 07:11:10,960
Are ready for me to stop like please don't no don't do

10272
07:11:11,600 --> 07:11:17,600
But please don't think I'm like just gonna abruptly stop overnight. Like that's not the reality of the situation at all

10273
07:11:19,040 --> 07:11:22,720
It's very likely I will want to focus on

10274
07:11:23,520 --> 07:11:26,160
Hypnosis audio is like way down the line

10275
07:11:26,720 --> 07:11:31,760
Um, it's over. No, so never no if you if you don't want me to go I'll be streaming in my little

10276
07:11:32,480 --> 07:11:34,480
retirement home doing my thing

10277
07:11:35,360 --> 07:11:37,040
um

10278
07:11:37,040 --> 07:11:39,920
I've got an end in stamina like seriously this is

10279
07:11:42,000 --> 07:11:49,280
Just it took so long to get here and everything worked out in the end and it just feels so nice to be

10280
07:11:51,840 --> 07:11:53,840
I don't I just

10281
07:11:54,400 --> 07:12:03,440
Like to be accepted to be um just having fun folk want to hang out. It's just casual. It's none of this like

10282
07:12:04,560 --> 07:12:06,160
you know

10283
07:12:06,240 --> 07:12:08,240
artsy fartsy like

10284
07:12:08,640 --> 07:12:14,800
Oh, this vtuber is giggling their head off every two seconds. Um, this vtuber is like putting on this like

10285
07:12:15,280 --> 07:12:17,280
horrifically fake personality

10286
07:12:17,520 --> 07:12:20,240
Uh, pinna. Thank you for becoming a member. Um

10287
07:12:21,360 --> 07:12:29,120
The first year is an introduction. The second is establishing and third is plateau. That is quite literally what it is. Um, that is what most um

10288
07:12:29,920 --> 07:12:38,320
People experience. Um, if you've ever been like wait, why did that one in the vtuber, uh, go on a new account?

10289
07:12:39,680 --> 07:12:41,200
um

10290
07:12:41,200 --> 07:12:44,320
that's basically remaking a persona because

10291
07:12:44,960 --> 07:12:49,520
You plateau and it's perfectly natural to plateau. There's no there's no issue

10292
07:12:50,240 --> 07:12:53,600
Um only 155 more. We are mesh

10293
07:12:54,240 --> 07:12:55,440
Oh

10294
07:12:55,440 --> 07:13:02,640
Thank you. Peter ever in ham for becoming a member. I appreciate it. Can I be honest with you all for a sec?

10295
07:13:02,880 --> 07:13:04,880
Right, let's see. What's up

10296
07:13:04,960 --> 07:13:07,120
question mark

10297
07:13:07,120 --> 07:13:08,640
What's up?

10298
07:13:08,640 --> 07:13:10,640
Or does this reefling share with us?

10299
07:13:12,560 --> 07:13:13,600
We will

10300
07:13:13,600 --> 07:13:17,600
Strawny until we die at 99 because it's part of our little heart. Oh

10301
07:13:18,240 --> 07:13:20,560
I far okay. You're done reefling. You're done

10302
07:13:21,360 --> 07:13:25,440
Hmm deeply departed. He came and he farted

10303
07:13:28,400 --> 07:13:34,320
Damn you and people can't just do the same thing successfully without ever needing any variation in their content

10304
07:13:34,400 --> 07:13:36,560
I haven't seen examples of that before. Yes

10305
07:13:37,520 --> 07:13:42,480
Um, I really like the behind the scenes psychology about about at all. Um

10306
07:13:43,440 --> 07:13:45,440
Monster girls, please

10307
07:13:46,000 --> 07:13:52,880
Thank you for coming to member. Is that you asking for gen two designs to be monster girls? Oh boy. You're in for a treat

10308
07:13:53,600 --> 07:13:55,600
um

10309
07:13:56,000 --> 07:13:57,520
Yeah

10310
07:13:57,520 --> 07:14:00,640
There's been two designs that have been accepted

10311
07:14:02,240 --> 07:14:04,240
Lollilolliloll

10312
07:14:06,160 --> 07:14:11,680
Mods take some of his pennies and scatter them across his home wait, that's so specific

10313
07:14:12,400 --> 07:14:14,400
Oh, I don't know

10314
07:14:15,920 --> 07:14:19,280
I feel like you feel happy streaming. I can see that

10315
07:14:20,000 --> 07:14:22,000
Here junior. Can't imagine momy

10316
07:14:22,560 --> 07:14:24,400
without this

10317
07:14:24,400 --> 07:14:28,400
There was obviously right actually I can tell you something behind the scenes

10318
07:14:29,280 --> 07:14:33,520
And you're not gonna like it, but it's no longer the case because I got a script manager in

10319
07:14:34,320 --> 07:14:36,320
If and when gen two came around

10320
07:14:36,720 --> 07:14:42,080
There was no way I could keep up with the daily streaming and trying to organize all the script stuff

10321
07:14:42,640 --> 07:14:46,640
Um, but thank you to script master for coming into play

10322
07:14:47,520 --> 07:14:49,520
because without them

10323
07:14:50,160 --> 07:14:55,600
Being there I with with gen two starting. I probably couldn't daily stream. So

10324
07:14:56,640 --> 07:14:58,240
That that's the honest truth

10325
07:14:58,240 --> 07:15:05,840
I was going to stream my ass off for an entire year like non-stop back-to-back double streams on some days doing like endurance this endurance that

10326
07:15:06,400 --> 07:15:09,680
Um, but thankfully that's no longer the case. Um

10327
07:15:11,520 --> 07:15:13,520
Obviously

10328
07:15:13,600 --> 07:15:16,800
when if and when gen three were to occur

10329
07:15:18,320 --> 07:15:24,560
That's a lot of girls to manage and I'm not sure how realistic the daily streams will be at that point

10330
07:15:25,520 --> 07:15:31,200
There's my only concern and the thing is none of us have a crystal ball to look into the future

10331
07:15:31,360 --> 07:15:39,120
So I can't tell by zero by zero by zero every day is a blessing. No, don't cry. Don't do him. Don't do him

10332
07:15:39,120 --> 07:15:43,040
We're not even there. We've not even we've not even got the first model of gen two

10333
07:15:43,600 --> 07:15:49,600
Literally we have fucking two approved concepts. That's it. Don't burn out in spite. See that's the thing

10334
07:15:49,760 --> 07:15:56,960
Spite can get you very far. Maybe I will spite everyone and just say I'll stream daily and you guys weren't ready for it

10335
07:15:57,360 --> 07:15:59,360
It's so jovert. No

10336
07:15:59,840 --> 07:16:04,320
Less than six kxp for 80 million hp and I'm just telling you

10337
07:16:05,360 --> 07:16:08,080
That I'm from shume brap triber allegations. I've not been been

10338
07:16:08,640 --> 07:16:10,000
No

10339
07:16:10,000 --> 07:16:15,840
Stranny you're talking about the future and the game background is making me feel emotional. Okay. No. No. No. No happy happy thoughts happy thoughts

10340
07:16:16,720 --> 07:16:18,720
um

10341
07:16:18,720 --> 07:16:23,760
If you can do this and not even two weeks. I can't imagine what you're gonna do in a year

10342
07:16:25,040 --> 07:16:28,880
I mean, it's not really gonna change like oh, sorry

10343
07:16:29,440 --> 07:16:30,400
and

10344
07:16:30,400 --> 07:16:32,400
There's not really much like this is

10345
07:16:32,560 --> 07:16:36,480
Me having happy times. We do have some monthly events planned

10346
07:16:37,280 --> 07:16:39,280
and

10347
07:16:39,600 --> 07:16:41,360
type things uh

10348
07:16:41,360 --> 07:16:45,840
Going on got ASMR collabs planned. I think ASMR is like a bread and butter. Please

10349
07:16:46,720 --> 07:16:54,240
Please consider ASMR as a bread and butter of y'all or and some people kind of get annoyed when like ASMR at ASMR

10350
07:16:54,560 --> 07:16:55,120
um

10351
07:16:55,120 --> 07:17:00,640
VTubers dabble and ASMR and don't always like commit to it fully, but no, let's bread and butter

10352
07:17:00,640 --> 07:17:03,200
I think everyone's gonna be participating in it just silly

10353
07:17:04,400 --> 07:17:05,760
um

10354
07:17:05,760 --> 07:17:09,440
Can you spit on us? Yeah, you want me to spit all over your face?

10355
07:17:11,920 --> 07:17:13,920
Open it open your mouth

10356
07:17:15,200 --> 07:17:17,200
I'll let me spit on your face

10357
07:17:18,400 --> 07:17:20,400
um

10358
07:17:20,480 --> 07:17:22,480
Yeah, don't don't worry like

10359
07:17:23,200 --> 07:17:28,880
Ah freaking, you know how open and honest I'm I'll tell you what it looks like and what things are like and you know

10360
07:17:28,880 --> 07:17:34,560
People who do watch you can get a little tip bits of information or maybe early access information

10361
07:17:35,280 --> 07:17:37,040
VTubers ASMR

10362
07:17:37,040 --> 07:17:39,280
Finally someone combined two of my favorite things

10363
07:17:39,920 --> 07:17:45,440
Well, I actually got a lot of feedback where people were like, I am so tired of like VTubers

10364
07:17:46,160 --> 07:17:48,160
blue bowling

10365
07:17:48,240 --> 07:17:50,880
And they'll participate in something and then withdraw

10366
07:17:51,600 --> 07:17:52,800
and

10367
07:17:52,800 --> 07:17:58,160
Because they never really had a thing for it and I was like, oh my goodness aren't we hitting the

uh

10438
07:23:11,760 --> 07:23:14,640
Pick the memes right and it's probably got a lot of potential

10439
07:23:15,120 --> 07:23:18,400
I thought about doing like reading the most bizarre

10440
07:23:18,800 --> 07:23:23,840
Reddit stories because there's a really famous one where this guy broke both his arms

10441
07:23:24,240 --> 07:23:28,480
But I can't say the rest of it, but I wanted to read it because I thought it was all right

10442
07:23:29,920 --> 07:23:31,920
But I'm not sure it would work out

10443
07:23:32,640 --> 07:23:37,680
Maybe it would be like a twitter series I guess and I'll be like oh go subscribe to my youtube

10444
07:23:43,040 --> 07:23:45,600

10465
07:25:19,600 --> 07:25:21,600
We can't make that

10466
07:25:22,800 --> 07:25:28,400
I've got a sea queen audio coming out where I share you with all my daughters

10467
07:25:30,960 --> 07:25:37,120
Um, I always take uh, hmm first thing on my shift if you're good at something never do it for free exactly

10468
07:25:37,200 --> 07:25:39,200
The joker was a kitten

10469
07:25:39,200 --> 07:25:41,200
That's what food coloring is for

10470
07:25:42,400 --> 07:25:47,040
Didn't you get mm-hmm with all the girls at the same time in the ASMR booth with the eyes covered?

10471
07:25:47,120 --> 07:25:49,120
Yeah, basically that's how it happened

10472
07:25:50,320 --> 07:25:52,320
Hmm

10473
07:25:54,240 --> 07:25:58,880
But yeah, I've got a sea queen audio. I don't I think it'll be a donathon reward like because the girls

10474
07:25:59,520 --> 07:26:04,160
and are all gonna like help each other out with their donathon rewards like as uh

10475
07:26:05,280 --> 07:26:07,280
As I like, yeah, let's go

10476
07:26:09,520 --> 07:26:13,360
Sea queen, that's the only way we can that's the new saying

10477
07:26:13,360 --> 07:26:15,360
Um

10478
07:26:15,360 --> 07:26:21,120
POV all the girl velour girls are fighting over you the one human left on earth that hasn't

10479
07:26:21,760 --> 07:26:23,760
Decided on which girl

10480
07:26:24,240 --> 07:26:27,440
I thought about Icy and Emmy doing something like that

10481
07:26:28,240 --> 07:26:30,240
where they're fighting over

10482
07:26:31,840 --> 07:26:36,720
Where the ink goes or who the ink goes to um

10483
07:26:37,440 --> 07:26:39,440
Um

10484
07:26:39,760 --> 07:26:43,680
Sea queen, uh, yeah, I mean it's pretty creative. I'll give you that

10485
07:26:45,520 --> 07:26:50,080
Yeah, Icy and Emmy would a hundred percent fight over it, but I find it really hard

10486
07:26:50,960 --> 07:26:52,240
to do

10487
07:26:52,240 --> 07:26:54,000
that kind of

10488
07:26:54,000 --> 07:26:59,440
Seven five hundred swordfish and I burned two k of them. I burnt so much swordfish as well. Don't worry

10489
07:27:00,400 --> 07:27:05,520
Where the ink goes. Yeah, if I mean Icy ever collab like that, I would be so happy

10490
07:27:06,800 --> 07:27:10,160
I mean they already got a collab audio on the way um of that nature

10491
07:27:11,360 --> 07:27:13,920
Um, but it's a bit different. Uh

10492
07:27:14,960 --> 07:27:18,800
Do you want spoilers or do you not want spoilers? I don't mind doing spoilers

10493
07:27:20,560 --> 07:27:25,040
I think it's coming up. Is it august the collab audio start off? I think it might be

10494
07:27:26,560 --> 07:27:28,320
Um

10495
07:27:28,320 --> 07:27:30,320
It's got to be really hard to do

10496
07:27:30,960 --> 07:27:34,880
I want spoilers no spoilers. Oh, no you guys are split

10497
07:27:37,040 --> 07:27:40,160
Go hard with spoilers. Mmm

10498
07:27:42,000 --> 07:27:43,840
So in the plot

10499
07:27:43,840 --> 07:27:49,040
But close your ears if you don't want any spoilers in the plot Icy and Emmy fell out

10500
07:27:50,400 --> 07:27:54,400
And you the listener and you can either be a pin pal or

10501
07:27:55,360 --> 07:27:59,200
A snowberry wherever when you want you force them to

10502
07:28:01,520 --> 07:28:03,520
To make up

10503
07:28:04,080 --> 07:28:05,840
by

10504
07:28:05,920 --> 07:28:09,600
Using a massage gun to relieve their muscle tension

10505
07:28:10,080 --> 07:28:13,280
Because their muscle tension is the reason why they fell out

10506
07:28:16,720 --> 07:28:19,920
Okay, um, then me and mersey have one

10507
07:28:21,040 --> 07:28:25,360
Where we're uh nurses that shouldn't be qualified because of what we do

10508
07:28:27,440 --> 07:28:34,080
And then Azura and sheebie's one. I don't think the masses are gonna like you

10509
07:28:36,080 --> 07:28:41,520
I'm not gonna change it because I I like the script. I like it, but I'm not sure the masses are gonna like it

10510
07:28:42,320 --> 07:28:44,320
Azura and sheebie

10511
07:28:44,320 --> 07:28:46,320
catch you in public

10512
07:28:46,880 --> 07:28:48,880
um

10513
07:28:49,200 --> 07:28:51,200
Cross-grossing

10514
07:28:51,520 --> 07:28:53,520
And the m word you

10515
07:28:53,920 --> 07:28:56,160
And I don't know if it's gonna go down well or not

10516
07:28:57,280 --> 07:28:59,680
It's a very unique scenario, but please

10517
07:29:00,560 --> 07:29:03,360
And before you're like, oh my god, I hate it. Oh my god, stroney

10518
07:29:03,360 --> 07:29:08,720
I hope you die in a fire because you wrote that do you honestly think they're never gonna do another collab audio again?

10519
07:29:08,720 --> 07:29:10,720
Don't be so silly

10520
07:29:10,720 --> 07:29:12,720
It's just the first one that I gave

10521
07:29:13,600 --> 07:29:19,040
Yeah, it's pretty but it was pretty out there. I don't know. It's just the inspiration. I got to write for them

10522
07:29:19,760 --> 07:29:22,880
So I wrote it and there it was and they what?

10523
07:29:23,680 --> 07:29:29,440
Holy moly, that's a spicy meatball a massage gun. Yes a massage gun. I'm excited for them

10524
07:29:29,520 --> 07:29:33,600
It's spicy. Oh boy that one does sound very uh, yes, uh

10525
07:29:34,800 --> 07:29:36,800
That sounds like something

10526
07:29:37,040 --> 07:29:41,840
Patreon would get no, they don't um, they don't care. Um, I know what's

10527
07:29:42,560 --> 07:29:47,680
Uh, good to go and what's not good to go on patreon. So damn. Yeah, really pretty. Yeah

10528
07:29:48,880 --> 07:29:51,280
I there's a few things I wanted to cover. Um

10529
07:29:54,960 --> 07:29:57,440
Having the freedom to explore a bunch of

10530
07:29:58,320 --> 07:30:00,320
Scripts is something the scripts

10531
07:30:03,360 --> 07:30:09,600
Yeah, like um, it's just different things we're hitting along the way like as I said, I kind of said it from

10532
07:30:10,720 --> 07:30:16,000
I'm not pigeon pigeon holding any girl into a particular

10533
07:30:17,120 --> 07:30:19,120
category because doing so will

10534
07:30:19,920 --> 07:30:26,720
Limit their income source and their income source and longevity are related to their success of yellow

10535
07:30:27,600 --> 07:30:31,600
And I do not want to kneecap anyone. That's not fair

10536
07:30:33,760 --> 07:30:39,600
It is what it is you're given spicy scenarios compared to anything else. I've seen this is some top-tier content. Yes

10537
07:30:40,160 --> 07:30:46,400
And literally when the girls do collab audios again, they still have three other audios going out that month as well

10538
07:30:46,480 --> 07:30:49,360
So it's not like, you know, not everything can be for you

10539
07:30:50,080 --> 07:30:52,320
We live in a society of burnt fish

10540
07:30:52,560 --> 07:30:54,560
I

10541
07:30:55,120 --> 07:31:01,120
Like to try different stuff. Yeah, literally just give it a shot either you'll listen to and you'll be like this isn't for me

10542
07:31:01,280 --> 07:31:03,280
Or you'll be like, okay

10543
07:31:04,080 --> 07:31:06,080
I'm reacting smile

10544
07:31:06,960 --> 07:31:13,040
There's there's only two outcomes. It's either no, thank you and turn it off or I'm reacting smile

10545
07:31:15,600 --> 07:31:21,920
We'll get we'll all get something at some time. Yeah, basically literally everyone is cared for

10546
07:31:22,320 --> 07:31:24,320
It's not possible

10547
07:31:24,320 --> 07:31:27,600
For a creator to come out with something you love 100% of the time

10548
07:31:27,680 --> 07:31:31,280
It's just not possible unless they do the same thing over and over and over again

10549
07:31:31,840 --> 07:31:37,360
But then that is like really pigeonholing and it's it's for the success of my girlies. Okay

10550
07:31:38,320 --> 07:31:40,320
They gotta succeed

10551
07:31:40,320 --> 07:31:44,160
Or what's gonna make them want to sign there the second year of the contract, huh?

10552
07:31:47,840 --> 07:31:50,320
Can't wait to find out what it is. I love

10553
07:31:52,480 --> 07:31:54,480
Oh, I'm glad

10554
07:31:58,640 --> 07:32:01,120
Thanks for reading it anyway, we would

10555
07:32:02,400 --> 07:32:05,280
They just misspelled something and I said it wrong or something. It's okay

10556
07:32:06,560 --> 07:32:09,280
I'm not into feet, but I like yours. Oh, yeah

10557
07:32:12,000 --> 07:32:14,480
I love everything viewers done so far. Thank you

10558
07:32:16,240 --> 07:32:18,240
um

10559
07:32:18,480 --> 07:32:20,480
you know, I had a year in the making and

10560
07:32:21,360 --> 07:32:26,080
Just everything is falling into place so beautifully. Um, I spoke to

10561
07:32:26,560 --> 07:32:29,840
Oh, I'm gonna say her. I'm gonna butcher her names so badly

10562
07:32:30,960 --> 07:32:32,960
The Vtuber obaki

10563
07:32:33,520 --> 07:32:40,400
That's definitely not how you say it, but um, she was talking about a project finally coming together and

10564
07:32:41,200 --> 07:32:44,960
You know, I was like, oh, I can completely relate to that. So I replied to it

10565
07:32:45,680 --> 07:32:52,800
And I was like when the puzzle pieces finally arrive and you can start slotting them into place is so satisfying

10566
07:32:53,520 --> 07:32:55,200
and

10567
07:32:55,200 --> 07:32:57,200
And I felt that to my very core

10568
07:32:58,560 --> 07:33:05,280
The everything obaki pump. Yeah, it's not obaki. There's no way that's how you're supposed to say it sounds like

10569
07:33:05,280 --> 07:33:08,560
I'm trying to say tobacco. Obaki. Obaki

10570
07:33:09,840 --> 07:33:12,400
That's exactly how you say obaki. Oh, wow

10571
07:33:13,280 --> 07:33:18,000
No, me accidentally being smart. I can't believe it

10572
07:33:19,440 --> 07:33:21,440
Obaki obaki

10573
07:33:22,960 --> 07:33:27,120
That is the say say it first try. Oh, I'm so smart with the heck and

10574
07:33:28,320 --> 07:33:34,480
Yeah, she put up a tweet saying like her projects are finally coming together and I'm like, oh, I can relate to that on such a deeper level

10575
07:33:37,680 --> 07:33:40,240
And oh, mommy's excited to be

10576
07:33:41,200 --> 07:33:47,600
Five moods ahead and her main chess game. Oh, I can't wait to one be one years in chess. Actually you guys aren't ready

10577
07:33:49,360 --> 07:33:52,080
Tobacco is true. No, no tobacco

10578
07:33:54,400 --> 07:33:59,840
I can't smoke I can hardly drink to the life of me. I get one beer in me and I'm gone

10579
07:34:00,720 --> 07:34:04,160
That's why I wanted to do drunk apex because we can all do salt lake city

10580
07:34:05,280 --> 07:34:07,280
Because no one's in it other than us

10581
07:34:08,000 --> 07:34:16,160
Uh, I don't know what drunk game. I wanted to do drunk game, but I don't go offline until we win type of thing

10582
07:34:17,040 --> 07:34:19,040
But I didn't know what game to do

10583
07:34:22,080 --> 07:34:26,320
If I lose I get to see discord, right? What? Um

10584
07:34:30,320 --> 07:34:36,000
Wait, what if you lose the one be one chess you get to see the discord where we all say inappropriate stuff to each other

10585
07:34:37,920 --> 07:34:39,920
Say no on that one chief

10586
07:34:40,880 --> 07:34:46,880
I've been a lazy refland. I haven't looked at any of your daughters. Yeah, you haven't. Have you not checked any of them out?

10587
07:34:49,120 --> 07:34:51,120
Actually the highlight

10588
07:34:51,360 --> 07:34:58,080
Reels are from debut or right around the corner. I think there's one more girl that needs to be made

10589
07:35:00,080 --> 07:35:04,080
Um, and then the debut highlight things can be made

10590
07:35:04,640 --> 07:35:09,360
Um can be uploaded. I know that everyone's monetized as well

10591
07:35:11,440 --> 07:35:18,800
What opening do you use in chess? Uh, I call it the twat move because I don't know what what on earth is my opening move

10592
07:35:19,920 --> 07:35:25,520
Probably the second pawn just shove them out by two. Have a wee go

10593
07:35:27,040 --> 07:35:28,640
I don't know nothing about chess

10594
07:35:29,120 --> 07:35:34,480
All I know is that I want a one be one you guys in chess and I'll put classical music on in the background

10595
07:35:34,800 --> 07:35:37,840
And I'll see if I can even win against one refling

10596
07:35:38,960 --> 07:35:41,360
It'll be interesting to see if I can win one game

10597
07:35:43,600 --> 07:35:46,640
I can easily recommend girls like a shopkeeper

10598
07:35:48,800 --> 07:35:50,800
I have a secret conspiracy

10599
07:35:51,120 --> 07:35:55,920
Strony allows a small handful of fans into the discord every month or so to be groomed by the girls

10600
07:35:56,640 --> 07:35:58,800
Then makes them forget and kicks them out

10601
07:36:00,240 --> 07:36:02,240
It's actually quite funny

10602
07:36:02,400 --> 07:36:06,240
No, uh, I sure there absolutely nothing goes on in the discord. Um

10603
07:36:07,120 --> 07:36:09,120
Mercy's ASMR was a banger

10604
07:36:09,600 --> 07:36:17,840
No, her is her meme ASMR. No, I didn't upload it. It couldn't be her actual ASMR stream got 25 000 views, which is insane

10605
07:36:18,800 --> 07:36:20,800
Insane in the membrane

10606
07:36:21,040 --> 07:36:25,680
Can you drill my dad? I'm terrible at chess, but he plays it daily

10607
07:36:26,000 --> 07:36:28,240
Are you joking me? He'd like smoke me in one

10608
07:36:30,240 --> 07:36:34,800
You can play checkers and connect four of his people here. What in runescape?

10609
07:36:38,160 --> 07:36:43,600
Play checker. What play connect four with me in runescape right now. What how do I do that?

10610
07:36:45,760 --> 07:36:47,600
Is that real?

10611
07:36:47,600 --> 07:36:49,600
At the grand exchange

10612
07:36:49,680 --> 07:36:55,600
Hold on. Wait, let me finish doing this batch of fish. We're going to the grand exchange like right now

10613
07:36:56,800 --> 07:36:58,800
Hello

10614
07:36:59,760 --> 07:37:01,920
Where's the grand exchange a little to the right?

10615
07:37:03,120 --> 07:37:08,960
Oh, there's a bridge here. Oh, but we don't have the freaking tunnel at the grand exchange. We're gonna have to go down in our wall

10616
07:37:10,240 --> 07:37:12,720
What we can break in one v one each other

10617
07:37:14,160 --> 07:37:17,280
Right, we're going to the grand exchange to play connect four. I'm not even kidding

10618
07:37:18,560 --> 07:37:20,960
I'll empty my inventory though. I don't want to go filthy

10619
07:37:21,760 --> 07:37:25,520
Stranny, I'd feel bad about beating you in chess. Oh, no, that's the thing. I like losing

10620
07:37:26,720 --> 07:37:28,720
You know dumb loss and all

10621
07:37:31,120 --> 07:37:36,320
You see now if I lose against you after you said you have never played would be such a sad and depressing thing

10622
07:37:36,320 --> 07:37:38,320
I would need something to feel happier

10623
07:37:38,720 --> 07:37:40,960
Get plopped get plopped get plopped there. You're happy

10624
07:37:42,560 --> 07:37:47,200
I'm joined listen to um playing overwatch in the meantime. Oh god. How is overwatch these days?

10625
07:37:47,760 --> 07:37:50,640
I know a new character came out venture, but

10626
07:37:51,520 --> 07:37:52,880
um

10627
07:37:52,880 --> 07:37:59,280
Folk weren't happy about or something. I've I've nothing apparently she eats rocks lamal

10628
07:38:00,560 --> 07:38:02,560
What rockier? Um

10629
07:38:04,240 --> 07:38:09,440
Right, how the heck right we're going if any reeflings want to follow me just follow my character

10630
07:38:10,000 --> 07:38:14,960
Um, and then we'll go down to the grand exchange to pledge to play connect four

10631
07:38:15,680 --> 07:38:17,680
Any reeflings want to come?

10632
07:38:18,480 --> 07:38:20,480
Uh

10633
07:38:20,880 --> 07:38:26,960
Right, okay, how's it right? We're going to the grand exchange to play connect four. No, I'm not trolling

10634
07:38:27,920 --> 07:38:29,920
We're doing it

10635
07:38:30,080 --> 07:38:32,080
Oh, wait, I should walk because that reeflings walking

10636
07:38:34,080 --> 07:38:39,360
Oops, no, no, no, we got the reefling car. Oh, no, wait, hold on. We need to help this reefling that's stuck

10637
07:38:42,720 --> 07:38:49,360
Okay, there that worked. Yeah worked. Okay, we got that reefing. We'll walk around these borders until we're out

10638
07:38:50,560 --> 07:38:53,060
And then I think it should be okay

10639
07:38:54,400 --> 07:38:58,800
Going to the grand exchange to play four in a room

10640
07:38:59,680 --> 07:39:01,680
four in a room

10641
07:39:03,360 --> 07:39:10,960
Me also me, uh, it's going to take me so long to get 99 cookies and also me. Let's go to the grand exchange

10642

Just so we can play some bit. Yeah

07:39:15,760 --> 07:39:17,760
Well, we already are

10644
07:39:21,120 --> 07:39:23,360
Look at all that raw fish that needs to cook

10645
07:39:24,720 --> 07:39:28,160
Is the grand exchange the trading hub? It absolutely is

10646
07:39:28,960 --> 07:39:30,960
Oh, wait, we can follow

10647
07:39:33,760 --> 07:39:35,760
We are following rabbit

10648
07:39:36,560 --> 07:39:43,200
There's an entry to the west of the grand exchange. Wait, I thought it was blocked for members only. I don't have any agility though

10649
07:39:45,920 --> 07:39:47,920
Yeah

10650
07:39:48,560 --> 07:39:50,560
Isn't this

10651
07:39:50,960 --> 07:39:52,960
Yeah

10652
07:39:53,600 --> 07:39:55,600
Huh

10653
07:39:56,080 --> 07:39:58,400
Playing video on a video opening in the wall, uh

10654
07:40:00,480 --> 07:40:02,480
We're learning

10655
07:40:02,480 --> 07:40:04,480
Thanks for being in human history

10656
07:40:05,200 --> 07:40:10,640
Oh, no, we're playing chess and the loser must have be the winner for the day. Oh, what's gonna happen?

10657
07:40:11,680 --> 07:40:14,240
It's annoying tanking is but

10658
07:40:15,600 --> 07:40:17,600
All right

10659
07:40:18,480 --> 07:40:21,920
Okay, where the heck are we playing connect for? How do we do it?

10660
07:40:23,600 --> 07:40:25,600
This

10661
07:40:26,160 --> 07:40:28,160
No

10662
07:40:33,840 --> 07:40:36,640
Talk talk to who talk to them

10663
07:40:38,720 --> 07:40:42,800
Wants to play a ranked game of runelight two minutes per move

10664
07:40:44,800 --> 07:40:46,800
Oh, no, what does this mean?

10665
07:40:48,800 --> 07:40:50,800
Uh ranked

Oh, no, I didn't mean to place it there. Okay. Well, I'll put it there then

10670
07:41:13,520 --> 07:41:15,520

Wait, we can like straight up. No, you're not supposed to actually win against me. What the heck?

07:41:45,920 --> 07:41:47,920
And then that

Uh, how do I send a request to refling or do you guys send me a request?

10684
07:42:21,760 --> 07:42:23,920
I don't know how to send a request to play

10685
07:42:25,520 --> 07:42:27,520
Uh, I don't know how to play either

10686

Okay, you send me. We've not played drew yet. Right. I'm being

Um, okay take that

This is terrible. Wait, what are you doing? I'm trying to look at what the reflin's doing right a block them there

10694
07:43:11,360 --> 07:43:16,160
Oh, this is awful. Oh, no, you guys can see my thought process. Oh, no, I lost

10695
07:43:17,280 --> 07:43:19,280
I can't put one in one here

07:43:20,400 --> 07:43:22,400
So head out win put it here

10697
07:43:24,800 --> 07:43:27,040
Oh, no, you guys can see how dumb I am

10698
07:43:27,760 --> 07:43:30,160
Wait, what does that mean? Okay. I need to go up here then

10699
07:43:31,360 --> 07:43:34,480
Maybe like do this. No, I'm just gonna do that

10700
07:43:37,360 --> 07:43:39,360

10701
07:43:40,720 --> 07:43:42,720
Oh

07:43:43,360 --> 07:43:45,360
No, you're gonna ruin it for me

10703
07:43:48,160 --> 07:43:53,760
Both of us don't want to play in these ones. Well, I don't want to play because it's gonna get blocked

10704
07:43:56,080 --> 07:44:01,280
What are you doing? What happens if you go there? I don't know one two three one two three

I don't know how to do this

10707
07:44:07,760 --> 07:44:15,040
This is terrible. Can I put one here maybe? I'll put one there

10708
07:44:17,520 --> 07:44:19,520
Oh, no, they can like win again

10709
07:44:21,040 --> 07:44:26,640
Reflings, this is so hard. I don't think I can win. I can't put any here or I lose

10710
07:44:27,360 --> 07:44:28,720
Or here

10711
07:44:28,720 --> 07:44:32,480
So I'm basically just stacking them to the ceiling

10712
07:44:33,360 --> 07:44:35,360
until we can anymore

10713
07:44:36,080 --> 07:44:38,080

10728
07:45:45,200 --> 07:45:47,200
Oh

10729
07:45:51,520 --> 07:45:53,520

07:45:59,280 --> 07:46:02,480
I'll put it here

10732
07:46:03,920 --> 07:46:05,920
I don't know why I'm putting it here

10733
07:46:07,200 --> 07:46:10,880
Wait, why did you wait could I have one there? No, I couldn't have

10734
07:46:12,880 --> 07:46:14,880

07:46:17,600 --> 07:46:25,200
Oh, this is hard I'm like touching my face. I'm getting sweaty. I don't think I can actually win against any of you guys

10736
07:46:26,080 --> 07:46:28,080
Oh

10737
07:46:28,080 --> 07:46:30,960

07:46:33,920 --> 07:46:38,560
Maybe if I stack here that can do like this up here

10740
07:46:44,720 --> 07:46:46,720

If I go in the third column, he'll go there and he gets four in a row

10773
07:49:38,240 --> 07:49:42,560
None of us can play the third column because if he plays wait, why did you do that?

10774
07:49:44,720 --> 07:49:46,720
Why did you do that?

10775
07:49:47,040 --> 07:49:51,520
Did I distract you wait? Why did you do that? Did you mean that you win?

10776
07:49:53,680 --> 07:49:55,680
Are you right? I'm blind

10777
07:49:56,400 --> 07:50:00,880
Oh, I think you guys are just letting me win though. I'm gonna be honest

How did you do that? You went back up here

10791
07:51:03,440 --> 07:51:10,000
Right, I'll change my pattern. I won't cheat. I won't cheat. I'll change my pattern. I don't know what I'm doing though

10792
07:51:11,440 --> 07:51:18,240
I think I think we're just playing like crisscross applesauce one of the coolest games ever losing all the rank and honestly

More of them went green. I didn't even mean that

10799
07:51:45,280 --> 07:51:47,280
I don't know what this is. I'm having fun

10800
07:51:47,280 --> 07:51:49,280
Um

10801
07:51:52,160 --> 07:51:56,960

Uh, okay refling made a move. I want to make a move here

10804
07:52:13,040 --> 07:52:15,040

No, I can't here

10807
07:52:27,440 --> 07:52:32,400
You know, if I just click the board, oh, there we go. There we go. There we go. Something happened something changed

10808
07:52:33,920 --> 07:52:39,120
Taking mummy over element makes her here. I'm like so dumb. You're all gonna know I'm so dumb

10809
07:52:40,240 --> 07:52:42,240
It's not your turn. Okay

10810
07:52:43,760 --> 07:52:45,760
Sheissa

10811
07:52:46,320 --> 07:52:48,320

I'm warning you now refling. I'm taking this entire room. Fuck you. I'm taking this room

10816
07:53:18,320 --> 07:53:20,320
How does this work? I don't know

10817
07:53:21,600 --> 07:53:26,560
This is the most confusing game. Oh, it's my turn. I didn't even see what you changed

10818
07:53:27,440 --> 07:53:28,640
here

10819
07:53:28,640 --> 07:53:30,640
Oh, that was the terrible move

10820
07:53:31,680 --> 07:53:33,680
Here, okay, that was good move

10821
07:53:35,360 --> 07:53:37,360

07:53:37,920 --> 07:53:39,920
I'm not sure

10823
07:53:41,680 --> 07:53:44,160
He made that right up there. What does that mean to me?

10824
07:53:45,840 --> 07:53:50,400
I don't know. I'll do some points. Can I do this? Can I do that? Can I do this? I can do that

10825
07:53:50,560 --> 07:53:53,040
I'm just I'm just clicking on the board. I'm gonna be honest

10826
07:53:55,040 --> 07:54:00,240
Uh, Stroney, can you hear your sick accent for a little bit? I'm dying to hear it

10827
07:54:01,760 --> 07:54:03,760
We are country. Oh

God this checkers game is hard

10833
07:54:26,640 --> 07:54:30,320
Oh, I think I messed up. I maybe shouldn't have played that. Oh, no

10834
07:54:33,520 --> 07:54:35,520
Um

10835
07:54:36,240 --> 07:54:38,240
I

10836
07:54:38,560 --> 07:54:42,960
Both of us have no, I don't even know if this refling knows what he's doing. He probably does

10837
07:54:45,280 --> 07:54:47,280
If you are this cute when playing

10838
07:54:47,920 --> 07:54:49,920
Uh, I'll have that love heart solo

10839
07:54:50,560 --> 07:54:54,400
Corners are power spots when playing I can agree on chess and during stream

10840
07:54:54,640 --> 07:54:59,120
I'm too dumb for connect four. Is it my turn yet? Oh, no, it's not. Okay. Now it's my turn. Yeah, get rigged

10841
07:55:00,560 --> 07:55:05,440
I see you're still winning son. Am I? Oh, no, you two back. Wait, how do I take it back?

10842
07:55:05,520 --> 07:55:08,000
Get no, give me back. Give me that. That's mine

10843
07:55:11,520 --> 07:55:16,160
It's stop you're taken. Oh, no, that didn't do anything

10844
07:55:18,480 --> 07:55:23,280
Oh, no, I think I'm losing. What is that? Oh, what?

10845
07:55:24,800 --> 07:55:28,240
Like this does that do something? I don't know what I'm doing

10846
07:55:29,600 --> 07:55:32,560
I think I may I think we have to admit defeat unfortunately

10847
07:55:33,520 --> 07:55:36,960
Oh, I'm getting rolled everything's getting taken

10848
07:55:39,840 --> 07:55:42,960
I don't have the strength reflends. I'm doing so bad

10849
07:55:47,200 --> 07:55:48,560
Oh

10850
07:55:48,560 --> 07:55:50,560
Connect your pieces

10851
07:55:50,560 --> 07:55:52,560
Oh corner someone says corner

10852
07:55:53,760 --> 07:55:57,520
Don't play the corner. Oh sugar that didn't do anything

10853
07:55:58,720 --> 07:56:00,560
Oh, no

10854
07:56:00,560 --> 07:56:03,520
Near okay green green. I'll see green

10855
07:56:05,040 --> 07:56:08,560
Uh, but that turned green a little bit green

10856
07:56:11,200 --> 07:56:18,000
I guess it's like splatoon where you want everything to be your colors. Oh, that didn't do anything. Oops. I think I just threw that

10857
07:56:18,880 --> 07:56:24,320
You lose the board is filled. Oh, no, it was so hard. That was confusing

10858
07:56:25,120 --> 07:56:31,760
Uh, maybe we only do the other one. Oh, Amy wants to play. Yeah, sure. Amy will play

10859
07:56:33,760 --> 07:56:35,120
Uh

10860
07:56:35,120 --> 07:56:39,040
Amy's turn. I have never played it before either. I'm dumb. Okay, we just go

10861
07:56:39,760 --> 07:56:42,400
Right, Amy. You're getting rolled. I'm going here, Amy

10862

Oh, are you thinking reflin? I'm trying to get in your head or actually you're a pen pal because you're called imbebizo

10872
07:57:21,920 --> 07:57:23,920
What were you doing pen pal?

10873
07:57:24,080 --> 07:57:28,320
Are you trying to embarrass me? Oh, I saw you were about to get that. I saw that

10874
07:57:28,800 --> 07:57:36,000
Oh, what? How did you do that? I never even saw that. That was like my fastest freaking law as pen pals are ruling me

10875
07:57:37,520 --> 07:57:41,440
I never saw that at all. I was too busy focusing on my little right side play there

10876
07:57:42,400 --> 07:57:48,240
I'm not played against you yet. I'm going green. Uh your turn first

10879
07:58:09,040 --> 07:58:11,040

07:58:11,520 --> 07:58:13,520

10885
07:58:34,800 --> 07:58:36,800

10890
07:59:03,440 --> 07:59:06,640
Yeah, I was gonna say you already won you could have won down here

10891
07:59:08,800 --> 07:59:10,800
Wow, this is so hard

10892
07:59:11,520 --> 07:59:15,360
I don't know how people play this anymore. We fling I want to play

10893
07:59:16,480 --> 07:59:18,720
Uh, I'm not played you again

10894

07:59:35,680 --> 07:59:36,960
Maybe

10898
07:59:36,960 --> 07:59:38,400

10899
07:59:38,400 --> 07:59:40,560
You win another player resigned. Wait, what?

10900
07:59:41,920 --> 07:59:46,320
Did you mean that? I don't think you meant that we fling. Uh, do you want to try again?

10901
07:59:47,120 --> 07:59:49,360
Okay, there we go rank. Yeah, let's go

10902
07:59:50,640 --> 07:59:52,640
The other player's busy

10903

Okay, I'll go here then

10908
08:00:19,280 --> 08:00:21,280
I

10909
08:00:30,560 --> 08:00:36,000
What are you doing? What are you planning? No, where are you planning? What does it mean?

10910
08:00:40,560 --> 08:00:43,040
I don't know how to this

10911
08:00:43,440 --> 08:00:52,400
No, you're not supposed to go there. This is hard

10912
08:00:56,000 --> 08:01:03,040
No, don't win. Don't be selfish. Let me win. Don't be selfish. Let me win

10913
08:01:03,920 --> 08:01:05,920
No, I have to put it down

10914
08:01:06,800 --> 08:01:09,280
No, I don't want to put it down

10915
08:01:10,240 --> 08:01:15,600
Stop it. You're teasing me. Stop it. No, wait. No

10916
08:01:17,600 --> 08:01:19,600
No, I want to win

10917
08:01:21,040 --> 08:01:25,200
I want to win. We're both playing the same freaking stuff. No

10918
08:01:26,960 --> 08:01:30,720
Come on. Why is this game so hard?

10919
08:01:33,040 --> 08:01:35,040
Why isn't so hard?

10920
08:01:35,760 --> 08:01:42,800
This is terrible right cool again. There has to be one reefling in here that's called lower IQ than me. Come on

10921
08:01:44,000 --> 08:01:46,000
Let's I've not played through yet

10922
08:01:46,800 --> 08:01:51,680
There has to be a reefling that has a lower IQ. What the heck is this?

10923
08:01:52,960 --> 08:01:54,960
What do I do?

10924
08:01:55,120 --> 08:01:57,120
Examine what?

10925
08:01:58,000 --> 08:02:00,000
No, I don't know what to do

10926
08:02:00,800 --> 08:02:05,200
You just I click it? Wait, it's not let me do anything

10927
08:02:07,920 --> 08:02:11,680
Huh, it's not let me do anything. Hello

10928
08:02:13,840 --> 08:02:15,840
Examine board game piece

10929
08:02:17,280 --> 08:02:21,200
Huh, you move you move and jump diagonally

10930
08:02:22,800 --> 08:02:23,920
Oh

10931
08:02:23,920 --> 08:02:27,360
Okay, okay, we hold it you hold it and then drop it wait

10932
08:02:28,320 --> 08:02:34,000
I'm getting pranked why why am I getting pranked? What what what happened?

10933
08:02:36,080 --> 08:02:38,080
Wait

10934
08:02:38,320 --> 08:02:39,760
No

10935
08:02:39,760 --> 08:02:41,840
What?

10936
08:02:41,840 --> 08:02:43,840
I think it's a bit laggy

10937
08:02:46,240 --> 08:02:51,520
Can I just start moving them everywhere? No, they're tired. I'm sorry

10938
08:02:53,600 --> 08:02:55,600
Okay, wait

10939
08:02:55,760 --> 08:02:59,600
I can't move them. No, so I move you

10940
08:03:02,320 --> 08:03:04,320
What the heck

10941
08:03:06,960 --> 08:03:11,520
Uh, then you block me so I block you

10942
08:03:14,160 --> 08:03:16,160
What

10943
08:03:21,680 --> 08:03:23,680
Hey

10944
08:03:26,000 --> 08:03:28,000
Uh

10945
08:03:29,600 --> 08:03:31,600
Can I go back?

10946
08:03:32,640 --> 08:03:37,280
A legal move bro. I don't even know the rule book. I don't want to get jailed

10947
08:03:42,560 --> 08:03:44,560
And what like this

10948
08:03:45,760 --> 08:03:48,320
No, I can't, can I? Maybe

10949
08:03:50,640 --> 08:03:52,640
I don't, wait what?

10950
08:03:53,600 --> 08:03:59,120
Like this, okay, that was a load. Why are some things loaded? No

10951
08:04:03,760 --> 08:04:05,760
Oh

10952
08:04:06,560 --> 08:04:08,320
Hold

10953
08:04:08,320 --> 08:04:11,920
In the name of the checkers board. Wait, I can't do that. Hold in the name of the check

10954
08:04:12,080 --> 08:04:15,840
Hold in the name of the checkers board. Hold in the name of the checkers board

10955
08:04:19,040 --> 08:04:21,040
What this is crazy

10956
08:04:23,280 --> 08:04:28,800
I'm sorry. My little brain can't do this. Maybe we just play the four in a room

10957
08:04:30,400 --> 08:04:37,200
You can only move one tail if you're jumping over an enemy as many times as you can. What happened? I wasn't paying attention. Oh, no

10958
08:04:37,760 --> 08:04:39,760
Something happened

10959
08:04:41,040 --> 08:04:43,840
You can only jump a tail so here

10960
08:04:46,160 --> 08:04:49,920
No, it's not your turn. Oh, sorry. What and then do that

10961
08:04:50,640 --> 08:04:52,640
What the heck

10962
08:04:54,960 --> 08:04:56,960
Am I accidentally winning right now?

10963
08:04:59,280 --> 08:05:00,640
I might be

10964
08:05:00,640 --> 08:05:07,920
It's plausible. Hold on. Can you go back? Oh, you can't go back. You can only go up. Okay. Wait, that didn't do anything

10965
08:05:11,200 --> 08:05:13,200
Can you be like gridlocked in this game?

10966
08:05:16,400 --> 08:05:18,400
Yes

10967
08:05:19,280 --> 08:05:23,840
Uh, sure go up there then. Wow. What am I doing? I can't go back

10968
08:05:25,840 --> 08:05:28,400
If you reach the end of the board you get knighted

10969
08:05:30,240 --> 08:05:33,120
Oh, neither. Oh, no, he won

10970
08:05:35,920 --> 08:05:37,920
I lost again

10971
08:05:39,680 --> 08:05:42,160
Reflames. Oh my god

10972
08:05:42,400 --> 08:05:44,400
Oh

10973
08:05:45,920 --> 08:05:51,200
No, he won I can't go back and we'll let me go back on him

10974
08:05:55,760 --> 08:06:00,480
Right, okay, what can I do? I can't even go forward or anything. I just did that

10975
08:06:01,600 --> 08:06:06,960
Game ends when all the pieces are taken. How can they be taken? We can't go backwards

10976
08:06:08,400 --> 08:06:11,680
I don't get it. I'm so confused. He's not won yet

10977
08:06:12,240 --> 08:06:14,240
What?

10978
08:06:18,480 --> 08:06:23,200
Wait, so if he comes here, I can only jump forward one

10979
08:06:27,040 --> 08:06:29,040
This is too hard

10980
08:06:30,480 --> 08:06:34,000
Oh, no, what happened? Something changed. I don't know

10981
08:06:36,560 --> 08:06:39,200
So I can't go backwards. I can only go forwards

10982
08:06:40,080 --> 08:06:42,080
Well, then I might as well push forward then

10983
08:06:43,120 --> 08:06:45,840
Surely surely that's how it works

10984
08:06:48,720 --> 08:06:51,040
Okay, and now then I take you

10985
08:06:52,800 --> 08:06:55,600
No, I can't take you you're too far away from me

10986
08:06:57,280 --> 08:07:02,240
Then I push you forward to play I guess

10987
08:07:03,760 --> 08:07:07,680
No, I don't one at a time. Sorry one move at a time. Apologies one step

10988
08:07:08,400 --> 08:07:10,400
Oh, this is so hard

10989
08:07:10,640 --> 08:07:15,840
Oh, no, my guy got taken. Wait, how do you so I can only go one way

10990
08:07:18,240 --> 08:07:23,040
Then that would push what that pushes him there and then I can't push up so I need to do that

10991
08:07:23,120 --> 08:07:25,520
Oh, no, that blocks him. Oh, I didn't mean to do that

10992
08:07:26,480 --> 08:07:28,480
Uh

10993
08:07:29,600 --> 08:07:31,600
What is a knight do I don't know

10994
08:07:33,920 --> 08:07:36,560
I'm not sure can he take everything now

10995
08:07:38,640 --> 08:07:40,640
Hmm

10996
08:07:40,720 --> 08:07:42,720
And then can go backwards

10997
08:07:44,160 --> 08:07:47,600
Oh, wait, so I just need to move him forward like here

10998
08:07:48,720 --> 08:07:50,720
Okay, I'll push him forward

10999

Okay, I'll push him. Oh, he got taken right. Hold on. I'll push him forward then

11000
08:07:56,480 --> 08:07:59,440
Wait, am I gonna perish? I think I'm gonna perish. I don't think I can win

I'll take you

11016
08:09:07,440 --> 08:09:11,600
Oh, no, this refling's thinking you're not supposed to think against me

11017
08:09:15,040 --> 08:09:18,480
Monka, what's this refling thinking? I don't know. He's taking his time

11018
08:09:20,720 --> 08:09:24,400
I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous what he's planning

11019
08:09:25,680 --> 08:09:28,800
I don't know what he's doing. I can't see it if he's doing something

11020
08:09:30,720 --> 08:09:32,720
I don't see it

11021
08:09:34,640 --> 08:09:37,920
Here, I don't know what reason's planning

11022
08:09:42,160 --> 08:09:45,920
Well, I'll take that then you're not getting a four in the rule on me

11023
08:09:47,840 --> 08:09:49,920
I don't know if I do this. No

11024
08:09:54,640 --> 08:09:56,640
I block you

11025
08:10:00,160 --> 08:10:02,160
No

11026
08:10:09,520 --> 08:10:13,520

08:10:14,240 --> 08:10:17,520
La-dee-da-dee-da strong. He's too dumb to figure this out

11028
08:10:19,360 --> 08:10:21,360
Uh

11029
08:10:22,320 --> 08:10:24,320
Okay

11030
08:10:24,480 --> 08:10:27,200
So now what you're gonna put it there

11031
08:10:27,760 --> 08:10:33,760
No, he's gonna put there. Wait, hold on. What would that achieve one two three three three

11032
08:10:34,960 --> 08:10:37,440
So if I put it there, he has to go there so yeah

11033
08:10:39,840 --> 08:10:42,320
Will she finally get the dub? I have no idea

11034
08:10:43,120 --> 08:10:47,440
There has to be a refling that's lower IQ than me. Wait, you block me

11035
08:10:50,240 --> 08:10:55,200
Oh sugar, I wasn't supposed to do that. Oopsies. I foiled my own plan

11036
08:10:55,600 --> 08:10:59,360
Literally, you don't even need to like counteract me. I counteract myself

11037
08:11:00,480 --> 08:11:02,480
Like a dumb dumb

11038
08:11:03,680 --> 08:11:06,960
You already beat me strong in my IQ is too low

11039
08:11:08,560 --> 08:11:10,480
This is hard

11040
08:11:10,480 --> 08:11:14,720
You're kicked is so bad. Wait, we'll have one two

11041

So never

11043
08:11:21,680 --> 08:11:23,680
No

11044
08:11:24,640 --> 08:11:26,640
I'm so confused

11045
08:11:32,000 --> 08:11:34,000
Um

11046
08:11:34,080 --> 08:11:36,480
Are we both playing the same game right now?

11047
08:11:38,080 --> 08:11:42,080
We're both scared to play here because I win if he plays here

11048
08:11:43,920 --> 08:11:45,920
Oh, no

11049
08:11:46,800 --> 08:11:48,800
Oh

11050
08:11:49,520 --> 08:11:52,400

11051
08:11:53,280 --> 08:11:58,000
Honestly one he is all um. No, I've already played you all of us

11052
08:11:58,800 --> 08:12:02,800
Literally, how are you all smarter than me? This doesn't make any sense

11053
08:12:03,920 --> 08:12:05,920
How are you so freaking smart?

11054
08:12:09,280 --> 08:12:11,920
Bro, how is this game so hard?

11055
08:12:12,080 --> 08:12:14,080
Oh

11056
08:12:14,320 --> 08:12:18,080
You could have won just placed in the middle. No, he was gonna block me

11057
08:12:20,960 --> 08:12:22,720
Oh

11058
08:12:22,720 --> 08:12:28,480
Surely I can win one surely freaking temples. I can win one one faking

round

11060
08:12:30,560 --> 08:12:34,160
Of this. This is so hard. It's cuz we're

11061
08:12:35,040 --> 08:12:37,040
It's cuz we're men

11062
08:12:37,360 --> 08:12:41,280
Riefland you can't see that part of load. That's supposed to be the quiet part

11063
08:12:45,120 --> 08:12:50,640
Be honest, I was barely screaming by my brain's bright, bro. I'm like fainting this so

11064
08:12:55,600 --> 08:12:58,480
Like I'm gonna get ranked ranked

11078
08:13:56,320 --> 08:13:58,320
My bets that game leaves about to come flying

11079
08:14:04,000 --> 08:14:06,000

08:21:48,400 --> 08:21:51,680
I freaking love chicken so it's like the best meat source ever

11163
08:21:55,040 --> 08:22:02,640
A girl's when girls are curious when they're almost reeflings. Uh, oh wait, is that matter? Oh sugar. Um, um, what did you do?

11164
08:22:03,200 --> 08:22:09,280
What did you do? Thank you for the game strong. Oh, you're welcome. You don't have to take me for that

11165
08:22:09,280 --> 08:22:12,240
I have no idea what you did though. Oh wait, or this reason

11166
08:22:13,840 --> 08:22:17,520
What did you do? Was it something here? I think I'm having something here

11167
08:22:20,000 --> 08:22:22,000
Um

11168
08:22:24,160 --> 08:22:26,160
Papago

11169
08:22:27,040 --> 08:22:33,200
Uh, right, what happens if I go here? I don't know. Maybe I need to go down here

11170
08:22:37,840 --> 08:22:39,840
Um

11171
08:22:40,480 --> 08:22:42,480
Here maybe

11172
08:22:43,040 --> 08:22:45,040
I don't know

11173
08:22:46,320 --> 08:22:48,320
If I go here they'll lose I hope no

11174
08:22:49,120 --> 08:22:51,120
One two three

11175
08:23:05,760 --> 08:23:08,880
So hard I don't even see it

11176
08:23:11,040 --> 08:23:13,840
I literally can't even see it. I like at all

11177
08:23:13,840 --> 08:23:20,240
This is so hard. Is there any reeflings that haven't gone against?

11178
08:23:21,840 --> 08:23:23,840
I have a lot of guys everyone here

11179
08:23:27,600 --> 08:23:32,800
That's so hard right have I gone against everyone here? I may have you know that

11180
08:23:33,840 --> 08:23:35,360
um

11181
08:23:35,360 --> 08:23:38,000
Are you a beautiful all fans all fans?

11182
08:23:39,840 --> 08:23:42,880
Uh, maybe they're just confused why there's so many people here

11183
08:23:44,000 --> 08:23:47,360
Does anyone want to go again? Because I can play while I eat

11184
08:23:49,680 --> 08:23:53,200
But beyond range I think we're on room two. I think everyone's having a fair share

11185
08:23:58,000 --> 08:24:00,000
Um

11186
08:24:00,000 --> 08:24:03,840
Look at all you guys have like numbers and stuff now because you'd be beating me

11187
08:24:04,480 --> 08:24:06,480
Hold on

11188
08:24:06,640 --> 08:24:08,640
Um

11189
08:24:10,160 --> 08:24:13,280
I don't even know my phone. I'll pass. I've been meant to do it in that one

11190
08:24:15,760 --> 08:24:17,760
Hmm

11191
08:24:18,400 --> 08:24:23,040
Yeah, yeah, that's the best corner in location. I'll pay out

11192
08:24:26,560 --> 08:24:28,560
You should both

11193
08:24:31,360 --> 08:24:35,520
The same thing is you actually could have won three times if you went play some tales random like

11194
08:24:36,240 --> 08:24:40,080
I'm trying to think ahead of my moves. Okay, it's hard

11195
08:24:44,400 --> 08:24:46,400
Oh my god, this is delicious

11196
08:24:48,880 --> 08:24:51,280
Reeflings do you want me to baby bird you because I'll do it

11197
08:24:51,280 --> 08:24:53,280
Yep

11198
08:25:04,400 --> 08:25:09,600
Uh, don't like the look of that. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky

11199
08:25:16,880 --> 08:25:18,880
Oh, no

11200
08:25:22,240 --> 08:25:25,840
Why do I not see it? Why do I not see it coming?

11201
08:25:27,520 --> 08:25:33,840
Why do I not see it coming? I'm being so for real right now, right at the next one. I am not losing

11202
08:25:34,080 --> 08:25:36,400
I don't care what happens. I am not losing

11203
08:25:38,400 --> 08:25:40,400
I am tryharding so much

11204
08:25:41,360 --> 08:25:44,000
I am not losing this one. I'm so serious

11205
08:25:44,400 --> 08:25:51,520
Are we bimbo max I literally don't see it right you've placed it in the middle. That's fine

11206
08:25:53,120 --> 08:25:55,840
Is it I don't know we'll place it next to you then

11207
08:25:59,200 --> 08:26:06,640
That's fine, so I'll counter you from doing four in a row on the bottom and then I'll do this

11208
08:26:07,280 --> 08:26:09,280
All right

11209
08:26:11,840 --> 08:26:16,640
One two three so you can't go anywhere there but I can progress by going here

11210
08:26:21,040 --> 08:26:23,920
And that's fine you're allowed to do that

11211
08:26:27,040 --> 08:26:29,040
Right

11212
08:26:29,680 --> 08:26:31,680
Did I do it?

11213
08:26:31,920 --> 08:26:33,920
Uh, oh wait

11214
08:26:34,480 --> 08:26:36,480
What I thought I won there

11215
08:26:37,600 --> 08:26:39,440
Wait

11216
08:26:39,440 --> 08:26:41,440
Wait, why why did I not win there?

11217
08:26:42,880 --> 08:26:46,480
Like this did I counter them by going that way?

11218
08:26:49,040 --> 08:26:56,400
I will redeem myself. Oh no, right one two three four so drop it here

11219
08:27:00,480 --> 08:27:02,480
I'm tryharding I'm looking

11220
08:27:04,080 --> 08:27:11,200
All right, if you're there what one two three four fuck you

11221
08:27:18,480 --> 08:27:20,480
One two three four

11222
08:27:22,880 --> 08:27:27,280
What you try to do one two three here so I can't put it in this column

11223
08:27:27,280 --> 08:27:29,280
Um

11224
08:27:30,800 --> 08:27:32,800
Right you've put it up there, which is fine

11225
08:27:35,120 --> 08:27:37,120
Oh fuck you you blocked me

11226
08:27:38,880 --> 08:27:40,880
Uh

11227
08:27:40,960 --> 08:27:42,960
Right

11228
08:27:43,760 --> 08:27:45,760
So what happens now?

11229
08:27:46,480 --> 08:27:50,560
What did that do? No you're getting blocked. I don't know what you're doing, but don't do it

11230
08:27:53,520 --> 08:27:55,680
I don't know what you're doing there, but don't do it

11231
08:27:58,160 --> 08:28:00,560
What are you doing over here now?

11232
08:28:03,840 --> 08:28:05,840
That's fine

11233
08:28:07,360 --> 08:28:09,360
Whoa

11234
08:28:11,200 --> 08:28:18,000
Get rekt get rekt get absolutely rekt. Oh my god. I did it. I was like trying so hard

11235
08:28:18,080 --> 08:28:23,520
I was trying to see what you were trying to do. I was playing two characters at once on the board. Oh, we did it

11236
08:28:24,080 --> 08:28:27,120
I have lower connect for IQ

11237
08:28:29,840 --> 08:28:35,120
Okay, let's try again. All right, hold on. Let me take a bite of my food. Oh my god. I had to try so hard for that

11238
08:28:40,080 --> 08:28:42,080
Okay

11239
08:28:43,440 --> 08:28:45,440
Oh my god, that was so hard

11240
08:28:46,240 --> 08:28:50,640
I don't know how people play logic games all the time. I feel like my brain just gets so tired. I'm like, oh

11241
08:28:54,480 --> 08:28:56,480
I

11242
08:29:04,160 --> 08:29:07,920
Oh, shit. Oh, this is not looking good

11243
08:29:15,200 --> 08:29:17,760
Am I gonna throw I don't know what what you're trying to do

11244
08:29:20,640 --> 08:29:22,640
What are you trying to do

11245
08:29:23,600 --> 08:29:28,720
Don't feel bad. My brain is still at max capacity. Oh, no, what did you do? I wasn't paying attention, right? You get blocked

11246
08:29:38,640 --> 08:29:40,640
Oh

11247
08:29:41,360 --> 08:29:43,360
It's so hard

11248
08:29:43,920 --> 08:29:47,920
Bro, when you go back to cooking swordfish, this is so hard. How?

11249
08:29:49,280 --> 08:29:52,800
I never see it. I like physically can't see it coming

11250
08:29:54,160 --> 08:29:56,160
until I hear the

11251
08:29:59,280 --> 08:30:03,920
Bro girlfriend is pouty and frustrated and upset. She got destroyed and fucking

11252
08:30:04,720 --> 08:30:10,960
Not even just destroyed in runescape destroyed in runescapes like side player gate. Oh god. I'm sorry

11253
08:30:16,880 --> 08:30:20,080
Wait, how did I double down there? I didn't even need to find I'm tripling down

11254
08:30:20,080 --> 08:30:22,080
Oh

11255
08:30:31,760 --> 08:30:33,760
So I'm choking on my burrito in anger

11256
08:30:35,760 --> 08:30:37,760
Because I'm so bad at this game

11257
08:30:46,160 --> 08:30:48,160
No, you're gonna win

11258
08:30:48,720 --> 08:30:49,920
No

11259
08:30:49,920 --> 08:30:55,680
Look at freaking low my scores. Let's start on the third. Oh my god. You're so good to win. What are you doing?

11260
08:30:57,040 --> 08:30:59,040
One two three

11261
08:31:00,240 --> 08:31:02,240
I don't know what I'm doing either to be honest

11262
08:31:12,400 --> 08:31:14,400
Ah, what are you doing?

11263
08:31:16,000 --> 08:31:17,680
Stop

11264
08:31:17,680 --> 08:31:23,520
You're stressing me out. This reefland's gonna win. They're like genuinely stressing me out right get blocked

11265
08:31:25,920 --> 08:31:32,480
No, oh my god, I hate right we're going. No, I'm sorry. We're going back to edgeville. I'm actually fucking done

11266
08:31:32,560 --> 08:31:38,960
I'm actually I'm done. We're going back to edgeville. I'm not even I'm not even doing we're going back to edgeville

11267
08:31:39,120 --> 08:31:41,440
I'm so done. I'm so done

11268
08:31:42,400 --> 08:31:48,000
I'm going back to edgeville to cook freaking swordfish. This is so hard

11269
08:31:49,040 --> 08:31:54,800
This is so hard. I should surprise the exam get to fuck. I've got the lowest IQ in the uh

11270
08:31:56,000 --> 08:31:59,360
freaking lower than room temperature water. Oh my god

11271
08:32:01,680 --> 08:32:03,680
Why is that game so hard?

11272
08:32:04,480 --> 08:32:06,480
freaking the uh

11273
08:32:06,480 --> 08:32:08,480
To no one's surprise

11274
08:32:08,560 --> 08:32:14,480
The 1v1 chess stream has been delayed due to the fact that I'm probably gonna have to actually watch some chess tutorials

11275
08:32:14,560 --> 08:32:16,560
Because I don't know how the rules work

11276
08:32:18,160 --> 08:32:22,160
If she she starts speaking if you start speaking germy should really stop playing

11277
08:32:22,240 --> 08:32:26,160
I respect your dedication not to apply mind bullets to them to gain victory

11278
08:32:26,240 --> 08:32:32,240
To gain a victory is that what I should have done? I should just start like taking the bikini off and all that like bro

11279
08:32:33,120 --> 08:32:35,120
I was so hard for no reason

11280
08:32:36,560 --> 08:32:38,800
Take the random event. Oh, is it good? Sorry

11281
08:32:40,880 --> 08:32:46,240
Hello, uh, yeah, sure. I fancy an exam right. What's my oh, what is this?

11282
08:32:46,720 --> 08:32:50,160
Ah, she's got a fish. You've been slacking in your studies. It's time for an exam

11283
08:32:53,920 --> 08:32:56,800
They are thank you for the tip boy. They literally are though

11284
08:32:58,000 --> 08:33:02,000
There are two types of questions one requires you to find the next object in a pattern

11285
08:33:02,480 --> 08:33:05,520
And the second I will present you with 15 cards and a hint

11286
08:33:06,240 --> 08:33:11,920
That's so specific. What are we doing? What comes next shoes shoes shoes shoes?

11287
08:33:12,960 --> 08:33:16,640
That's correct. Next question pick the object that should come next to a pattern

11288
08:33:18,240 --> 08:33:20,560
A banana a dookie a pineapple

11289
08:33:21,680 --> 08:33:23,680
a slice of watermelon

11290
08:33:24,560 --> 08:33:28,480
Finally a pupil that uses her brains. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure sure

11291
08:33:29,840 --> 08:33:32,960
Uh, these are gardening tools. So we need a rate

11292
08:33:33,840 --> 08:33:39,360
To the exit. Okay. We did it. We did it. Please don't fail. Imagine if I did this

11293
08:33:43,200 --> 08:33:49,520
Oh my god, did you hear that the burrito just kissed me from the way I bit it? What's the book of knowledge to do?

11294
08:33:50,480 --> 08:33:52,320
Oh fishing

11295
08:33:52,320 --> 08:33:54,320
It took him

11296
08:33:56,560 --> 08:33:59,680
Wait, oh that wasn't to him. Oh my god

11297
08:33:59,680 --> 08:34:01,680
Oh

11298
08:34:02,240 --> 08:34:04,080
My god

11299
08:34:04,080 --> 08:34:06,080
Just when you think I couldn't get dumber

11300
08:34:06,800 --> 08:34:08,400
I just put

11301
08:34:08,400 --> 08:34:11,280
XP into fire making instead of cooking. Bruv

11302
08:34:12,320 --> 08:34:14,320
Can this get any worse?

11303
08:34:14,960 --> 08:34:22,000
I don't think it's any more obvious how low my IQ is holy crap. It's even a miracle. I can breathe and eat at the same time

11304
08:34:22,880 --> 08:34:24,880
um

11305
08:34:24,880 --> 08:34:26,880
Oh my god

11306
08:34:26,880 --> 08:34:32,240
Reeflings about to get jealous over a burrito for real for real. Did you not hear did it come up in the make it literally went

11307
08:34:33,120 --> 08:34:35,120
When I like bit into the burrito

11308
08:34:37,040 --> 08:34:44,160
It's fine. You're a fish. You are the goofiest of goober's. We love you immensely the fire making will warm up your IQ

11309
08:34:46,000 --> 08:34:51,520
Small brain after all that was that was so hard. I don't know how to play that. Ah jealous of a piece of

11310
08:34:52,080 --> 08:34:55,680
I'm just starting out here looking like process and brav

11311
08:34:56,400 --> 08:34:58,400
I was terrible

11312
08:34:58,720 --> 08:35:04,800
I literally rage quit. I'm like, no, I need to walk away. Thank you very much reefling for making the fire or

11313
08:35:05,600 --> 08:35:07,600
Any arsonists?

11314
08:35:08,080 --> 08:35:11,280
Absolutely. All right, let me keep eating this burrito before it gets cold

11315
08:35:15,920 --> 08:35:17,920
Oh are you squidding me right now?

11316
08:35:18,320 --> 08:35:19,440
Hmm

11317
08:35:19,440 --> 08:35:26,480
Strongly we're hungry. Can you get back in the kitchen? I mean level in cooking. Love you. You goofed

11318
08:35:26,880 --> 08:35:28,880
Thank you. I don't know man

11321
08:35:42,640 --> 08:35:47,280
See I'm not afraid to like sauce off after reefing as I choke on a piece of corn

11322
08:35:47,760 --> 08:35:49,760
I can't talk and freaking

08:38:11,600 --> 08:38:14,480
Oh, maybe if you're like under the table, then yeah

11369
08:39:41,600 --> 08:39:46,000
So I'm like I'm using my chip as a vessel to spoon it into my mouth

11370
08:39:47,200 --> 08:39:49,200
And not the in-game rating of my burp

11371

I struggle to eat a lot of red meat and then I wonder why I'm so ill

11375

11391
08:41:50,400 --> 08:41:52,400
Let's go to the booth

11392
08:41:53,760 --> 08:41:56,720
Am I dumb but can I ask what munker means munker

11393
08:41:57,280 --> 08:42:04,080
And munker s is a twitch emote where peppy looks really stressed out and he's like oh like like nervous

11394
08:42:04,880 --> 08:42:07,840
And and I reduce it to munker like munker

11395
08:42:08,880 --> 08:42:10,720
and

11396
08:42:10,720 --> 08:42:16,240
But if you type in munker s on google, it'll just show you what peppy looks like he's all stressed out

11397
08:42:16,560 --> 08:42:18,560
Hmm

11398
08:42:20,080 --> 08:42:25,200
Almost 4 a.m. And I'm so is it please go to sleep. Oh my god

11399
08:42:26,640 --> 08:42:32,560
Please don't worry about going to sleep like seriously. I don't want you guys like risking your health to watch me stream

11400
08:42:32,800 --> 08:42:37,040
Like I'm literally stuffing my face. I just got wrecked and connect for and I'm going straight back to cooking

11402
08:42:39,920 --> 08:42:41,920

11403
08:42:42,320 --> 08:42:44,320
Time for a hypnotic slumber

11404
08:42:47,120 --> 08:42:49,120
Hmm

11405
08:42:54,560 --> 08:43:00,000
Sleep is for the weakest weekend now sleep equals exp wasted

11406
08:43:02,880 --> 08:43:10,240
Oh my god, we're like really close to level or not next batch. I don't know what level 40 f 74

11407
08:43:10,240 --> 08:43:12,240
Yeah

11408
08:43:18,960 --> 08:43:20,960
I hate arching on mobile

11409
08:43:21,360 --> 08:43:23,120
hmm

11410
08:43:23,120 --> 08:43:26,160
See we've got like a billion different things to click to do anything

11411
08:43:29,600 --> 08:43:31,280
Oh

11412
08:43:31,280 --> 08:43:34,320
76 oh my god, how much did wine boosters?

11413
08:43:35,600 --> 08:43:37,600
I thought we were selling like 72

11414
08:43:41,200 --> 08:43:45,440
Wine is faster, but I want to use all the fish that the reeflings gave me

11415
08:43:46,320 --> 08:43:48,320
Because I don't want it to go away

11416
08:43:48,480 --> 08:43:51,360
I don't want it to be like rotting in my in my bank

11417
08:43:56,560 --> 08:43:59,600
Former level and you can cook sharks. Oh

11418
08:44:04,240 --> 08:44:08,480
Hmm I have a good night. Please rest well

11419
08:44:09,440 --> 08:44:13,600
Uh wine got me 72 to 65 in like under an hour. Oops

11420
08:44:17,440 --> 08:44:19,440
Um only power

11421
08:44:20,720 --> 08:44:24,880
Only power to bring me back to this gone forsaken game is like cute fish

11422
08:44:27,280 --> 08:44:29,280
It's a good game, but

11423
08:44:30,480 --> 08:44:35,040
If you've got stuff to do, it's not the easiest game to like keep up the excitement

11424
08:44:35,440 --> 08:44:42,880
I think runescape I would say is probably similar to like people say like when you start up a minecraft server, um

11425
08:44:44,560 --> 08:44:49,680
Pardon me and you play for like a week and then you all get burnt out and never go on it again type thing

11426
08:44:51,040 --> 08:44:54,400
Wine got you from 69 to semi-fee feels good, man

11427
08:44:55,280 --> 08:44:57,920
Cooking endangered species when no

11428
08:44:59,840 --> 08:45:04,640
Not cooking endangered species. There's plenty to go around in the runescape economy

11429
08:45:06,000 --> 08:45:08,000
More than enough actually

11430
08:45:08,560 --> 08:45:11,680
In fact, the waters are so infested with shark. They're everywhere

11431
08:45:14,960 --> 08:45:16,960
Thank you boy boy

11432
08:45:18,480 --> 08:45:20,960

11435
08:45:36,000 --> 08:45:38,000
I

11436
08:45:40,000 --> 08:45:42,000
Rainbow fish

11437
08:45:44,240 --> 08:45:50,080
Okay, I've almost finished eating. I'm so sorry if it feels like I've been chewing for ages. I was too busy getting

11438
08:45:51,040 --> 08:45:53,040
That's how many times have I done that now?

11439
08:45:53,680 --> 08:45:56,480
No, stop eating. What are you doing?

11440
08:45:58,480 --> 08:46:00,480
Jesus Louise woman

11441
08:46:00,880 --> 08:46:05,760
Okay, we've almost finished the

11442
08:46:07,760 --> 08:46:09,760
The fishy

11443
08:46:09,760 --> 08:46:12,640
Oh my god, sorry, I kind of think I'm just too busy eating

11444
08:46:13,600 --> 08:46:19,440
I'm almost finished eating. I promise I'll finish eating soon. I just take so long to eat

11445
08:46:22,640 --> 08:46:27,360
Walks into an eight hour stream. Thank goodness. I'm not late. I'm gonna

08:46:27,840 --> 08:46:29,840
Okay

11447
08:46:31,440 --> 08:46:33,920
For the architect bros, this one's for you

11448
08:46:34,480 --> 08:46:41,680
I order two meals because I have the second meal the next day. So tomorrow I'll be eating my next meal

11449
08:46:42,880 --> 08:46:44,880
So I'm gonna go put it in the fridge

In the and wash my hands because they're covered in grease. They're covered

11451
08:46:53,360 --> 08:46:55,360
She knows about

11452
08:46:56,000 --> 08:47:02,800
So when Azura got released, I read up a little bit and people were like, oh my god architect chocolate and I'm like wait

11453
08:47:02,800 --> 08:47:04,800
I thought you were

11454
08:47:04,800 --> 08:47:10,400
I was like reading. I'm like, okay, right. I get it now. Why architect is such a random word for it though

11455
08:47:13,600 --> 08:47:19,520
I still don't get the origin but hey, oh wait, I'm gonna very quickly wash my hands because they're covered in freaking

11456
08:47:19,520 --> 08:47:26,240
Grease from the burrito that was absolutely inhaling and getting rolled on I'll be literally a millisecond

11457
08:47:49,520 --> 08:47:51,520
So

11458
08:48:19,520 --> 08:48:21,520
So

11459
08:48:39,280 --> 08:48:43,600
I've just stood up and I'm aware of how full my bladder is I'm I'm gonna go pee

11460
08:48:49,520 --> 08:48:51,520
So

11461
08:49:19,520 --> 08:49:21,520
So

11462
08:49:49,520 --> 08:49:51,520
So

11463
08:50:19,520 --> 08:50:21,520

11477
08:51:16,000 --> 08:51:18,000
For any

11478
08:51:23,200 --> 08:51:25,200
Maybe better streaming hours would help you

11479
08:51:25,680 --> 08:51:28,400
What you mean don't do 12 hours naturally

11480
08:51:29,200 --> 08:51:33,040
What are you talking about refling? Don't say such nonsense

11481
08:51:33,840 --> 08:51:35,840
Are you trying to upset me refling? Huh?

11482
08:51:37,200 --> 08:51:42,160
You're trying to make me feel it's because you left us. Okay. I won't feel sick anymore

11483
08:51:43,120 --> 08:51:45,120
I

11484
08:51:45,520 --> 08:51:48,240
You're laughing but I have separation anxiety with you guys

11485
08:51:50,160 --> 08:51:54,720
It's been getting better, but I feel an immense amount of anxiety

11486
08:51:55,120 --> 08:51:56,560
um

11487
08:51:56,560 --> 08:51:58,080
at the

11488
08:51:58,080 --> 08:52:00,080
Before I click go live

11489
08:52:00,480 --> 08:52:03,680
And then it goes away when I am live

11490
08:52:04,320 --> 08:52:06,880
I'm not sure what that means. I mean I had it

11491
08:52:07,600 --> 08:52:09,680
last time wink wink, um

11492
08:52:10,640 --> 08:52:13,520
And then it subsided and it was back again

11493
08:52:13,920 --> 08:52:18,000
So I don't know if the plan is it's gonna subside off my body sooner. We love you too

11494
08:52:19,200 --> 08:52:23,280
Hey, scrawny, when are the elden ring streams when the dlc releases?

11495
08:52:24,240 --> 08:52:29,200
You've been playing for a while consider taking a break. Do you insult me jaggex?

11496
08:52:29,600 --> 08:52:36,000
Do you think me some prepubescent child that can't handle a little gaming session?

11497
08:52:36,960 --> 08:52:40,880
Jaggex please do not dare interrupt my flow

11498
08:52:43,440 --> 08:52:45,840
Do you ever get anxiety when it comes to ending streams?

11499
08:52:46,560 --> 08:52:51,920
I get nervous about ending the stream because of what I'm gonna see

11500
08:52:52,640 --> 08:52:58,000
And I know that seems silly because it's like well you say the same every time like I say like I'll see you tomorrow

11501
08:52:58,080 --> 08:53:01,040
Like I love you reflings a few kisses on that

11502
08:53:01,600 --> 08:53:06,240
But I get worried about it and I don't know why I think it's because I am saying goodbye

11503
08:53:06,720 --> 08:53:10,240
And it's like I won't see you until the next time I'm up, you know

11504
08:53:11,360 --> 08:53:13,520
and

11505
08:53:13,520 --> 08:53:15,920
Too much of a grimoire you somehow groomed yourself

11506
08:53:17,680 --> 08:53:21,280
Hey, here at viola, you don't groom us. What are you grooming?

11507
08:53:22,080 --> 08:53:24,720
What I'm what a slogan to have for

11508
08:53:25,520 --> 08:53:28,880
Every time I do that what slogan to have for a visa reasons

11509
08:53:29,120 --> 08:53:31,600
I can't believe I said that out loud with my full check

11510
08:53:32,720 --> 08:53:34,720
Ain't that true though

11511
08:53:35,600 --> 08:53:37,280
Yeah

11512
08:53:37,280 --> 08:53:43,840
Oh when I was lurking someone mentioned that they didn't realize we both have a nicotine patch on us because we're addicted to each other

11513
08:53:44,240 --> 08:53:46,960
It's not for the briefings are addicted to each other. No

11514
08:53:47,520 --> 08:53:49,760
Refling and strongy are addicted to each other

11515
08:53:52,640 --> 08:53:57,760
I can always ramble and procrastinate ending streaming call those for so awkward doing so. Mmm

11516
08:53:59,360 --> 08:54:03,280
Well, like when we reached the 10 hour board mark on that other stream

11517
08:54:03,360 --> 08:54:06,880
I can't even remember what it was the entire ending got caught

11518
08:54:07,360 --> 08:54:12,320
But I was like trying to say so much all at once just because like I wanted to you know

11519
08:54:13,360 --> 08:54:14,560
and

11520
08:54:14,560 --> 08:54:19,440
I wasn't expected to be groomed. I'm glad you did all that sounds terrible when you write that out in a sentence

11521
08:54:19,520 --> 08:54:24,240
I'm going to be honest. It makes me sound like a like a Chris Hansen. Take a seat moment

11522
08:54:26,560 --> 08:54:28,560
Yeah

11523
08:54:28,720 --> 08:54:30,720
Kind of true though. Hey

11524
08:54:31,920 --> 08:54:36,160
I think pre-stream anxiety is normal. You're talking to an auditorium worth of people

11525
08:54:36,640 --> 08:54:41,760
I actually don't get nervous to stream in that sense. Um, it doesn't

11526
08:54:44,000 --> 08:54:47,440
I don't look at the numbers like I don't I don't actually know. Um

11527
08:54:48,560 --> 08:54:54,960
It's not like on display for me. It's just me and reeflings playing multiplayer game. Um

11528
08:54:54,960 --> 08:55:00,720
And that's it like that's what it is. It's not like I'm nervous because I'm gonna have to go perform

11529
08:55:01,200 --> 08:55:08,000
I don't have any kind of imposter syndrome. I don't have any kind of like I'm not good enough

11530
08:55:08,800 --> 08:55:11,600
Um, I just like straight up have separation anxiety

11531
08:55:13,120 --> 08:55:14,560
Um

11532
08:55:14,560 --> 08:55:17,120
And that's it pretty much. Um

11533
08:55:18,320 --> 08:55:24,320
Like I don't get nervous to stream. I don't get like, oh my god. What happens if they don't like it? No, um

11534
08:55:25,520 --> 08:55:27,120
I'm just like

11535
08:55:27,120 --> 08:55:32,720
Just getting out of it. I'm like, oh god. I don't feel well. Like I feel sick. Like my stomach feels ill sometimes

11536
08:55:34,880 --> 08:55:38,720
But like like I've started up streams and I've said to you like oh guys

11537
08:55:38,800 --> 08:55:43,760
It's not gonna be like a long stream today and then it ends up turning into like six hours type thing

11538
08:55:44,480 --> 08:55:48,000
Um, when I only had the intention of two because I wasn't feeling well

11539
08:55:48,000 --> 08:55:51,840
But as soon as I start streaming it's like I get a second burst of wind

11540
08:55:52,480 --> 08:55:57,520
Like I'm super energetic. I'm super engaged and like I'm having like so much fun

11541
08:55:57,600 --> 08:56:02,560
I'm enjoying myself like right now. We're looking at pixels over and over again putting

11542
08:56:03,600 --> 08:56:06,640
Pardon me for being so rude. It was not me. It was my food

11543
08:56:07,680 --> 08:56:11,840
And like I'm having so much fun. Like look at all the reeflings that are in the bank with me right now

11544
08:56:11,920 --> 08:56:13,760
like all of us goofing off and like uh

11545
08:56:14,400 --> 08:56:16,080
Mac

11546
08:56:16,080 --> 08:56:18,720
Macer or maker mac maker

11547
08:56:19,440 --> 08:56:21,440
Thank you for coming to memba

11548
08:56:21,760 --> 08:56:23,760
um

11549
08:56:24,800 --> 08:56:26,800
It's just like

11550
08:56:28,640 --> 08:56:31,600
It's like me with so shiny. I don't want to go out but when I'm out it's fun

11551
08:56:31,840 --> 08:56:36,000
Yeah, it's kind of like getting over the hump if you will and

11552
08:56:38,240 --> 08:56:39,760
And like

11553
08:56:39,760 --> 08:56:41,680
I especially

11554
08:56:41,680 --> 08:56:45,840
Enjoy my endurance streams. Like I kind of spoke on it the other day. Um

11555
08:56:46,240 --> 08:56:47,360
Um

11556
08:56:47,360 --> 08:56:54,080
One time I was having a really bad time and reeflings were just hanging out with me and this isn't now

11557
08:56:54,240 --> 08:56:56,320
This isn't now. This is like way in the past. Um

11558
08:56:57,600 --> 08:57:01,360
And we played a song and it's called mr. Kitty. Um

11559
08:57:02,160 --> 08:57:05,920
I actually like a really depressive song or kind of slow tempo song

11560
08:57:07,040 --> 08:57:11,680
And I heard it and I was listening to and it made me feel a certain way

11561
08:57:11,760 --> 08:57:18,000
It made me feel quite negative. Like it was quite a depressive song mr. Kitty after dark. Yes, that was the song

11562
08:57:18,880 --> 08:57:23,840
And I listened to and I typed and I said is this what you guys feel like all the time

11563
08:57:25,440 --> 08:57:28,480
Because of the way the song had like resonated with me

11564
08:57:28,560 --> 08:57:34,400
It felt as rough as I had felt in that moment because I was feeling rough because you know stuff was going on behind me. Um

11565
08:57:36,080 --> 08:57:39,440
And it kind of like made me realize like

11566
08:57:39,920 --> 08:57:41,040
Like

11567
08:57:41,040 --> 08:57:44,560
If me hanging out having a carry on rambling

11568
08:57:44,960 --> 08:57:51,040
Coming up with all these like silly little ASMR ideas and like all these collab ideas and elaborate stuff and all of that

11569
08:57:51,520 --> 08:57:57,440
And like it makes you not feel like that when I stream like how blessed and how lucky

11570
08:57:58,080 --> 08:58:00,400
like we're on this timeline like

11571
08:58:01,760 --> 08:58:03,760
You know, you can feel

11572
08:58:04,640 --> 08:58:07,920
I don't like accepted to just like do your own thing

11573
08:58:08,000 --> 08:58:14,480
Like I always say the phrase you can be at arm's length. You can be attached at the hip. You can be on my head type thing

11574
08:58:14,480 --> 08:58:17,040
It's completely up to you V Flynn. Um

11575
08:58:18,400 --> 08:58:22,400
But I do remember that night because I was like you guys feel like that like when

11576
08:58:23,440 --> 08:58:26,720
Just in general like you have like such a rough time and then you come

11577
08:58:27,680 --> 08:58:34,400
On stream and like you come and you you make me laugh. You make me giggle. We tell terrible puns while going

11578
08:58:35,200 --> 08:58:36,480
like

11579
08:58:36,480 --> 08:58:38,560
And we're just hanging out type thing

11580
08:58:38,560 --> 08:58:41,520
You know it was like even when like you feel so rough

11581
08:58:41,680 --> 08:58:48,880
You're so willing to like come to me be so accepting of me like say such nice things to me and encourage me to do stuff

11582
08:58:49,840 --> 08:58:54,880
Um and all of that and it's just like it's such like a nice way like hopefully

11583
08:58:55,360 --> 08:58:59,600
I hope it's like a positive feedback loop where you make me giggle

11584
08:58:59,840 --> 08:59:04,800
I make you giggle and like we just have a fun time for what it's worth. Um

11585
08:59:06,800 --> 08:59:09,360
Sometimes you need a song like that to marinate in your thought

11586
08:59:09,520 --> 08:59:15,360
Yeah, like I don't listen to what I consider like sad music in the dumps music or emotional music

11587
08:59:15,600 --> 08:59:20,240
Like I listen to atarashi gako. Um, and like tokyo calling

11588
08:59:20,880 --> 08:59:24,000
Tokyo calling. Um, like I listen to hatsu and miki

11589
08:59:24,000 --> 08:59:26,880
I don't even know what's happening half the time when I listen to hatsu and miki

11590
08:59:27,200 --> 08:59:33,200
But like the music's so upbeat it's so up-pop like I never listen to anything depressive like I like goofy

11591
08:59:34,080 --> 08:59:40,320
Um, like literally I'm listening to a dutch song. I have no idea what's being said other than the lyrics suck my

11592
08:59:41,520 --> 08:59:43,360
um

11593
08:59:43,360 --> 08:59:45,360
type thing, you know

11594
08:59:45,360 --> 08:59:47,360
What was I saying?

11595
08:59:48,480 --> 08:59:55,120
Thanks for the stream strutting. I'm off to watch mercy. Yes. Um any snippets mercy modiste is live and she

11596
08:59:56,000 --> 09:00:01,040
Is playing with my willy. Uh, she's not. Um, maybe in another life

11597
09:00:02,320 --> 09:00:04,320
Um

11598
09:00:04,720 --> 09:00:09,760
Thank god no each one. Uh, right hold on. Let me check hatsu miki has become a legendary figure

11599
09:00:10,640 --> 09:00:14,240
Of making a homework right. Hold on. What is mercy playing?

11600
09:00:14,880 --> 09:00:19,920
Is zura still alive? Azura is still alive. She's playing stream live

11601
09:00:20,720 --> 09:00:24,880
Uh, mercy modiste. Uh, mercy is playing harvester

11602
09:00:26,160 --> 09:00:29,520
Part two. I already knew that because I said that earlier and yet I forgot

11603
09:00:30,160 --> 09:00:32,160
See you brain

11604
09:00:32,160 --> 09:00:34,160
See you brain

11605
09:00:34,880 --> 09:00:36,880
Uh

11606
09:00:40,000 --> 09:00:43,840
I got a comment on the new the asmr video

11607
09:00:45,920 --> 09:00:48,400
And someone's like why is this being recommended to me?

11608
09:00:50,080 --> 09:00:54,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you can't resist the asmr

11609
09:00:59,680 --> 09:01:02,720
The most I felt like that after dark was when that

11610
09:01:02,800 --> 09:01:04,800
Um

11611
09:01:05,120 --> 09:01:11,520
When you go in member to a members world, I don't know if we need to do a members world this stream

11612
09:01:11,600 --> 09:01:14,720
It may be next stream. We're doing members world unfortunately

11613
09:01:16,160 --> 09:01:17,920
although

11614
09:01:17,920 --> 09:01:19,920
Wine isn't members is it?

11615
09:01:20,640 --> 09:01:24,000
No, maybe not. I don't know if we're just doing members all the way to the end

11616
09:01:24,880 --> 09:01:28,480
It if we're doing wines all the way to the end people say wines is faster

11617
09:01:29,440 --> 09:01:35,440
I literally get algorithmed. Honestly. What did you miss? I stuffed my face and then

11618
09:01:36,720 --> 09:01:38,720
Let uh

11619
09:01:39,840 --> 09:01:43,280
Let the architect bros know I've got them in the back of my mind

11620
09:01:48,080 --> 09:01:51,280
Um, yeah, hold on. Hold on

11621
09:01:53,280 --> 09:01:57,200
The begging ASMR is peak ASMR. Honestly. Wait, what does it say now?

11622
09:01:58,480 --> 09:02:03,680
It's still going. Oh my god. Is that 23,000 views?

11623
09:02:05,200 --> 09:02:07,200
That doesn't make sense

11624
09:02:08,000 --> 09:02:14,640
Architect bros eating good just like strongy. Honestly. What does it mean architect architect is a

11625
09:02:15,520 --> 09:02:18,160
terminology used for people who enjoy

11626
09:02:19,040 --> 09:02:24,160
bigger body types or eating type of content

11627
09:02:25,120 --> 09:02:30,400
Or gaining weight type of content, but there's different levels to it

11628
09:02:31,120 --> 09:02:37,920
Um, so Azura delays body type because she's not like the default skinny malinky

11629
09:02:38,000 --> 09:02:42,960
I keep opening this freaking collection box. Um, VTuber, so

11630
09:02:44,720 --> 09:02:47,760
She would get referred to as someone for the architect

11631
09:02:48,320 --> 09:02:50,320
Bros

11632
09:02:50,640 --> 09:02:54,560
Look at all the swordfish. They're so purple

11633
09:02:56,400 --> 09:02:58,400
Why are you so purple?

11634
09:02:59,680 --> 09:03:01,680
A

11635
09:03:03,520 --> 09:03:05,520
Specifically vtubers, I think

11636
09:03:07,040 --> 09:03:09,040
She shuffled herself and then

11637
09:03:10,320 --> 09:03:14,640
Yes, uh, again Azura duly is live with a stream

11638
09:03:15,520 --> 09:03:21,280
Hopefully her pc doesn't explode. Um, and merci mondice is playing harvester part two

11639
09:03:21,600 --> 09:03:27,120
Which she never told me there was a part two because I'm getting a highlight reel of part one

11640
09:03:28,000 --> 09:03:31,120
Which isn't going to make any sense if I don't get highlight reel apart

11641
09:03:35,760 --> 09:03:40,160
I love strongy. I love reeflings. What are you going to do about it? Huh? You're going to kiss me on my lips

11642
09:03:41,120 --> 09:03:43,120
You know, let me hold your hand

11643
09:03:43,520 --> 09:03:45,520
Actually, I have something to ask

11644
09:03:45,920 --> 09:03:47,920
The reeflings are

11645
09:03:48,160 --> 09:03:52,160
You guys are like small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. Basically

11646
09:03:53,280 --> 09:03:55,440
Do you guys like that you're smaller than me?

11647
09:03:56,800 --> 09:03:58,800
Or would you like

11648
09:03:59,280 --> 09:04:05,520
A mascot that's like bigger. Oh my god. Why am I struggling so hard with this bank system?

11649
09:04:06,960 --> 09:04:10,640
Um, like you're so nice and tame. Yeah smaller than you is better

11650
09:04:11,360 --> 09:04:18,400
What is my size? Um, I don't even think I have a reference artwork. I can use that isn't toss breaking

11651
09:04:20,800 --> 09:04:21,600
Small is nice

11652
09:04:21,600 --> 09:04:27,360
Yes, you're if you didn't know secret hidden lore for the reeflings your tentacles can grow as long as you like

11653
09:04:27,360 --> 09:04:29,840
So you can interact with things as much as you need

11654
09:04:30,480 --> 09:04:35,680
Um, you have very very long tentacles if you so desire, but they're just nice and cute and stacked together

11655
09:04:35,760 --> 09:04:42,720
Whilst you are in oh my god the crisscross salmon the salmon are going upstream look they're going upstream

11656
09:04:47,920 --> 09:04:53,280
We are growers not sure it's exactly hmm almost like a previous lore strange

11657
09:04:54,320 --> 09:04:59,940
It small means when you cuddle as we feel you every yeah, I can put you in my mouth in my tummy

11658
09:05:00,340 --> 09:05:02,340
Yeah

11659
09:05:03,940 --> 09:05:12,020
Uh, we can go explore strony in the first sense. Hmm should I blindfold reeflings but let your tentacles do what they want?

11660
09:05:14,580 --> 09:05:16,580
Bank boost I'm not going to mess it up this time

11661
09:05:18,900 --> 09:05:20,900
Wow

11662
09:05:22,660 --> 09:05:28,740
Oh, wow, how do I do the fire? Huh? Okay, there we go

11663
09:05:30,580 --> 09:05:35,780
Strony subtly mentioned war. I don't mind it. No, I clearly I like giant ass like war

11664
09:05:37,220 --> 09:05:39,220
um

11665
09:05:40,660 --> 09:05:42,660
What else I like

11666
09:05:43,860 --> 09:05:45,860
Um

11667
09:05:47,220 --> 09:05:50,660
Try to think of other things that are considered like not regular

11668
09:05:53,780 --> 09:05:56,420
Hmm spelunking me no

11669
09:05:57,380 --> 09:05:59,380
Oh

11670
09:05:59,780 --> 09:06:01,780
I can't escape that word

11671
09:06:02,580 --> 09:06:07,860
It's like mongolian throat singing. It's everywhere. It's everywhere. Can't escape it

11672
09:06:08,980 --> 09:06:10,980
No spelunking

11673
09:06:11,220 --> 09:06:13,220
What does it even mean?

11674
09:06:14,500 --> 09:06:21,220
You cannae tell me it's not related to the bedroom spelunking. I can't wait to go spelunking with the reeflings

11675
09:06:22,180 --> 09:06:25,780
Oh, I can't wait until we go into a tight dark

11676
09:06:26,900 --> 09:06:28,500
damp

11677
09:06:28,500 --> 09:06:35,220
Cave and spelunk together like bro. Whoever named spelunking spelunking you knew exactly what you did

11678
09:06:36,900 --> 09:06:39,220
I mean cave exploring. Yeah

11679
09:06:41,300 --> 09:06:43,300
I literally

11680
09:06:44,420 --> 09:06:49,860
You've ever heard such a more ridiculous word. How dare they make such a word

11681
09:06:51,300 --> 09:06:53,460
Oh my god, you're still doing absolutely

11682
09:06:55,060 --> 09:06:57,060
Wakey wakey sleepyhead

11683
09:06:58,260 --> 09:07:05,620
Goodnight Strony send luck to my country tomorrow. I have no idea what your country's doing tomorrow, but please don't perish if it's bad

11684
09:07:08,020 --> 09:07:10,020
Good luck to your country

11685
09:07:10,180 --> 09:07:15,220
And rest well for anyone who do need to sleep. Please don't worry. We are literally just

11686
09:07:15,940 --> 09:07:19,300
going for another three hours and then

11687
09:07:21,540 --> 09:07:22,900
Uh

11688
09:07:22,900 --> 09:07:27,380
We'll redirect into a streamer. I don't know who I don't even know who's not online normally at this time

11689
09:07:28,100 --> 09:07:32,260
Uh, but we will find a vtuber that is live that we can redirect into

11690
09:07:33,060 --> 09:07:39,780
The euro cup fitba is on the new all right. Okay, right. Good luck. Uh, I am down for some spelunking right now

11691
09:07:40,500 --> 09:07:47,220
Uh, plunging is another fun one plunging. Please don't plunge me. That's not abysmal

11692
09:07:47,460 --> 09:07:49,460
Hmm

11693
09:07:49,700 --> 09:07:51,700
Spelunking in the cave of a giant ass

11694
09:07:52,500 --> 09:07:56,500
I don't know how to have far to go with the giant ass and the zero

11695
09:07:56,580 --> 09:08:00,420
I might not make her do the weird side of things. I may do the weird side of things

11696
09:08:04,500 --> 09:08:06,500
But yeah

11697
09:08:10,020 --> 09:08:12,660
No, no plunging not even a little

11698
09:08:13,380 --> 09:08:20,100
You can plug me up. Whoa. Wait, hold on. I was like so direct. My brain was like, oh

11699
09:08:20,820 --> 09:08:28,260
This'll this is fine. This is clearly beating around the bush. Nope. No, it's not. It's absolutely not. I just straight upset what

11700
09:08:29,140 --> 09:08:31,140
what I uh

11701
09:08:32,100 --> 09:08:36,260
Sorry, you know, actually I can tell you something that was really terrible

11702
09:08:36,260 --> 09:08:42,340
So if all the development issues hadn't occurred, I actually

11703
09:08:43,220 --> 09:08:44,420
fully

11704
09:08:44,420 --> 09:08:46,420
was going to

11705
09:08:48,740 --> 09:08:49,620
Are you squinting me?

11706
09:08:49,620 --> 09:08:54,420
Uh, hold on. I don't know what you think. Giant ass for content one day totally

11707
09:08:54,980 --> 09:08:56,980
Ah

11708
09:08:57,140 --> 09:09:02,340
I'm freaking happy to make it anonymous. It doesn't bother me. Like I like it. I don't mind at all. Um

11709
09:09:03,300 --> 09:09:06,180
I don't like the you die ones. I don't like that

11710
09:09:06,340 --> 09:09:10,260
I like the ones where you just kind of appear on the other end all fine and good

11711
09:09:10,420 --> 09:09:13,860
And maybe a bit moody because you accidentally got swallowed or something like that

11712
09:09:14,660 --> 09:09:16,100
um

11713
09:09:16,100 --> 09:09:18,500
She's letting the intrusive thoughts went honestly though

11714
09:09:19,140 --> 09:09:26,260
This is terrible. So if all the development issues didn't happen all the girls were posting like all these audios on twitter and I was like

11715
09:09:26,900 --> 09:09:32,420
Uh, I should probably do one as well. But like after debut and I thought wouldn't it not be really

11716
09:09:33,460 --> 09:09:35,300
terrible if

11717
09:09:35,300 --> 09:09:37,300
I may or may not have been

11718
09:09:39,860 --> 09:09:41,860
PLug

11719
09:09:42,500 --> 09:09:48,260
Uh during like debut and after and then once the stream ended I would go record

11720
09:09:48,900 --> 09:09:54,980
and like do something with it and then finish and then post it and you know

11721
09:09:55,540 --> 09:10:00,020
So that was my idea. But obviously that all crumbled apart. Thanks to development issues. Um

11722
09:10:01,940 --> 09:10:03,940
But yeah, I thought it would be pretty cute

11723
09:10:05,060 --> 09:10:06,260
But

11724
09:10:06,260 --> 09:10:10,580
That would have been amazing. Unfortunately. It's not possible. It's not possible

11725
09:10:11,540 --> 09:10:16,340
And there was so many developmental issues in time and I could absolutely strangle some people

11726
09:10:16,420 --> 09:10:18,420
But that's just what happens like literally

11727
09:10:19,140 --> 09:10:23,780
Um, oh, sorry. There was a refling that messaged me that apologized for

11728
09:10:24,500 --> 09:10:27,540
criticizing the company for saying like, oh, it'd be better if

11729
09:10:28,340 --> 09:10:35,940
The girls could make their designs. Please don't feel bad. I absolutely completely get where you come from. Um,

11730
09:10:36,500 --> 09:10:37,620
just for

11731
09:10:37,620 --> 09:10:39,620
How do I keep doing that?

11732
09:10:39,620 --> 09:10:41,620
I give up. Um

11733
09:10:41,700 --> 09:10:48,100
Please don't feel bad about saying that like you said it in a nice way. We had some negative criticism that was like

11734
09:10:48,580 --> 09:10:52,820
Oh pre-made model. Actually one of the most bizarre criticisms we got

11735
09:10:53,460 --> 09:10:55,460
um was

11736
09:10:56,100 --> 09:11:00,100
What was it? It was like, oh, they don't even have talents ready

11737
09:11:00,740 --> 09:11:04,500
When we opened up auditions and it was like, yeah, you're fucking Egypt

11738
09:11:04,740 --> 09:11:08,340
We didn't have talents. So we're opening auditions like every other Vtuber agency

11739
09:11:08,580 --> 09:11:10,020
But when we do it, it's bad

11740
09:11:10,020 --> 09:11:12,900
But when everyone else does it, it's fine and that was like, what?

11741
09:11:13,540 --> 09:11:16,740
It was the most bizarre thing I had ever read honestly

11742
09:11:18,340 --> 09:11:20,340
um

11743
09:11:20,420 --> 09:11:28,020
We have plenty of time for a future fun. Well, literally opened up auditions and someone was like, what if she'd be 2.0 look like this?

11744
09:11:29,300 --> 09:11:32,180
I mean, she's getting an update to our model. I don't know how much she's said

11745
09:11:32,260 --> 09:11:35,540
I'm not gonna say anything if she doesn't say anything. I'm not gonna say anything

11746
09:11:36,020 --> 09:11:39,860
Thank you for the tip as well anonymous. Sorry. I almost forget to thank you

11747
09:11:41,300 --> 09:11:44,820
Um, I won't say anything until she be says something but

11748
09:11:45,220 --> 09:11:47,220
Yeah

11749
09:11:48,420 --> 09:11:50,420
Outfit she said outfit

11750
09:11:54,500 --> 09:11:59,540
Right, I'll I'll leave it at that if she's not directly said what it is. I'm not gonna say

11751
09:12:00,580 --> 09:12:02,580
She said outfit

11752
09:12:05,140 --> 09:12:09,620
Uh, we don't have workers because we're not open yet many baffled honestly

11753
09:12:10,260 --> 09:12:14,900
It was bizarre like I remember reading it actually there's a reflin

11754
09:12:15,380 --> 09:12:17,380
It must have been a reflin

11755
09:12:17,460 --> 09:12:21,300
It must have been a reflin because you made me he haul my arse off

11756
09:12:22,100 --> 09:12:26,660
And I can remember the quote because I used to quote it because someone defended the agency

11757
09:12:27,060 --> 09:12:31,220
They must I think they're a reflin or possibly just someone who's enthusiastic about the girls in general

11758
09:12:31,780 --> 09:12:34,820
So someone criticized the company because they were like

11759
09:12:35,540 --> 09:12:37,220
Oh

11760
09:12:37,220 --> 09:12:43,140
Another agency where you have to give up your model to work with them and get their their pre-made models or whatever

11761
09:12:43,780 --> 09:12:47,140
And then someone commented and replied to them and there was like

11762
09:12:47,860 --> 09:12:53,300
No one wants your ugly as sin model like that was to the quote your ugly as sin model

11763
09:12:53,940 --> 09:12:55,300
Oh

11764
09:12:55,300 --> 09:12:58,900
I wish I could have interacted with it because it made me he

11765
09:12:59,460 --> 09:13:04,100
Ha so badly is that no one wants your ugly as sin model

11766
09:13:04,900 --> 09:13:06,900
Oh, my god

11767
09:13:07,220 --> 09:13:08,020
I

11768
09:13:08,020 --> 09:13:15,220
Literally was like getting so close to printing that out and putting it on my fridge because it was just so hilarious to me

11769
09:13:15,300 --> 09:13:17,300
Like it was so hilarious

11770
09:13:18,020 --> 09:13:20,020
um

11771
09:13:20,020 --> 09:13:22,020
Like I just oh my god

11772
09:13:23,140 --> 09:13:25,140
um

11773
09:13:25,140 --> 09:13:31,460
It vin miss vin san vin san vin sin vin sin

11774
09:13:32,420 --> 09:13:36,580
Vincent thank you for becoming a member that took me so long to figure out. I'm so sorry

11775
09:13:37,140 --> 09:13:39,140
No, not sin sister

11776
09:13:39,140 --> 09:13:42,100
It was just the terminology the guy used because someone was like

11777
09:13:42,500 --> 09:13:48,260
Oh, I don't want to give up my model type thing and I don't want this. I don't want that like basically complaining about the agency

11778
09:13:48,260 --> 09:13:51,140
And it was like rub one you've not even applied to you're not interested

11779
09:13:51,140 --> 09:13:57,060
So three shut the fuck up and then some reflin or just someone who was a good fan come swooping in

11780
09:13:57,540 --> 09:14:03,140
And replies what I was basically thinking no one wants your ugliest sin model and I'm like

11781
09:14:03,940 --> 09:14:05,940
It's so good

11782
09:14:06,100 --> 09:14:13,060
It's so funny. Anyway, so you made my day whoever whoever like came swooping under to defend the agency you have made my day

11783
09:14:13,140 --> 09:14:14,020
um

11784
09:14:14,020 --> 09:14:21,300
Hellscape. Thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate it the membership stream start next week. Uh, you've got plenty

11785
09:14:22,260 --> 09:14:27,060
Uh, it's a bit warm not gonna lie a bit hot in here. Yeah, but it's a bit sweaty out here

11786
09:14:27,620 --> 09:14:29,940
Surprise the bank hasn't caught on fire. Honestly

11787
09:14:30,980 --> 09:14:32,420
um

11788
09:14:32,420 --> 09:14:35,700
Forgive her. She's tired and forgot how to read. Oh, no, what did I miss me?

11789
09:14:36,260 --> 09:14:38,500
Oh, what are you yapping about strongy? She be cooking

11790
09:14:39,380 --> 09:14:44,260
So I think she be has allured to something which I'm more than happy for her to

11791
09:14:44,980 --> 09:14:50,020
Um, but I don't think she's fully said what it is and I don't want to ruin it because it's quite a nice thing

11792
09:14:50,100 --> 09:14:54,340
I think it's quite a nice thing and it's like the most basic common courtesy thing. Um

11793
09:14:55,380 --> 09:14:57,380
Allured she be alert to it

11794
09:14:58,820 --> 09:15:00,820
There were some abysmally

11795
09:15:01,540 --> 09:15:03,540
stupid takes on a flume

11796
09:15:04,980 --> 09:15:08,020
It's just the way the guy typed the message

11797
09:15:09,460 --> 09:15:15,060
I just constantly remember the phrase ugly as sin model. I was like, oh my god

11798
09:15:15,860 --> 09:15:24,180
Talk about like catching screwy like oh my god. I don't think I could recover if someone was like your ugliest sin model

11799
09:15:27,060 --> 09:15:29,860
Oh my god, love it. Love it. Love it. Love it

11800
09:15:31,780 --> 09:15:37,700
Then mummy you have broken youtube. We are going for 6.1 subs. Oh my god

11801
09:15:39,220 --> 09:15:41,860
The video was the video honestly that funny

11802
09:15:42,340 --> 09:15:47,220
I'm like, I'm second guessing myself. I'm like, what's the video truly that entertaining

11803
09:15:47,220 --> 09:15:51,780
Like I was just kind of seen please a lot by the end of it and started like breathing in the mic really weird

11804
09:15:52,980 --> 09:15:56,900
I only know one agency that lets their talents pick their models literally

11805
09:15:57,940 --> 09:16:00,420
I've only heard one other agency do it as well

11806
09:16:01,380 --> 09:16:03,380
um

11807
09:16:03,380 --> 09:16:08,900
But I'm quite happy for the girls like to design their 2.0 like emmy designed her 2.0 like I'm more than happy

11808
09:16:08,900 --> 09:16:13,780
If she wants that makes her happier and all that then juice. What am I gonna fucking say about it? Nothing

11809
09:16:14,500 --> 09:16:16,980
Oh guys as long as the girls are happy. They're happy. Um

11810
09:16:18,260 --> 09:16:20,260
I made mommy ink herself

11811
09:16:20,260 --> 09:16:23,220
Has my whole life been a mistake. Is this peak content for you from?

11812
09:16:24,740 --> 09:16:29,300
Uh, also the amount of people that could not read. Oh, I felt so bad

11813
09:16:30,100 --> 09:16:32,980
Actually, we had one japanese girl

11814
09:16:33,380 --> 09:16:36,100
Um apply and I felt so bad

11815
09:16:36,580 --> 09:16:38,580
Because she had such a lovely voice

11816
09:16:38,660 --> 09:16:44,820
But she could hardly speak any english and I was like, it's not gonna work. It's such a shame

11817
09:16:45,540 --> 09:16:48,420
She had worked for a previous agency

11818
09:16:49,060 --> 09:16:51,060
um

11819
09:16:51,060 --> 09:16:58,100
And I think google translate was helping her through the page and she inquired on the website and I felt so bad being like

11820
09:16:58,980 --> 09:17:02,660
Bro, you can't speak english. I can't have you there was actually a russian

11821
09:17:03,300 --> 09:17:08,900
Person that reached out as well. She was like, I know you I know your agency's english

11822
09:17:09,140 --> 09:17:13,060
But can I stream in russian and have a russian audience and I'm like

11823
09:17:13,700 --> 09:17:21,060
Ah, yes, let us the english vtuber agency come out with talents that where I can't even like moderate what you're doing or saying like

11824
09:17:21,220 --> 09:17:22,420
what

11825
09:17:22,420 --> 09:17:25,860
Some folk had like don't get me wrong. We're lenient, but

11826
09:17:26,820 --> 09:17:29,460
We do have to say like that's not even possible

11827
09:17:30,180 --> 09:17:32,980
Like what you're asking for isn't even possible

11828
09:17:34,180 --> 09:17:35,860
um

11829
09:17:35,860 --> 09:17:42,180
It was a shame. I loved emi's 2.0 design. I'm glad. I'm glad. I think she had a lot of fun design in her 2.0

11830
09:17:43,220 --> 09:17:44,340
um

11831
09:17:44,340 --> 09:17:46,340
so, yeah

11832
09:17:46,740 --> 09:17:49,620
How good was good as application? What?

11833
09:17:50,580 --> 09:17:57,460
Good is still a thingy. Oh, you want to trade with me? Hold on. Let me put my swordfish away. I'll trade with you. What's up?

11834
09:17:58,340 --> 09:18:00,340
What's up low leaflin?

11835
09:18:02,180 --> 09:18:05,220
Uh, maybe oh, it's so what is this?

11836
09:18:06,980 --> 09:18:08,980
Are these doughnuts to put around your

11837
09:18:10,580 --> 09:18:15,620
disc of returning disc of returning yellow boots yellow gloves. What?

11838
09:18:15,620 --> 09:18:17,620
Huh?

11839
09:18:17,940 --> 09:18:19,940
What have you given me? What does it look like?

11840
09:18:20,420 --> 09:18:22,660
activity

11841
09:18:22,660 --> 09:18:24,660
You can only enter

11842
09:18:24,660 --> 09:18:27,780
Thor dors black hole from the dwarven mains

11843
09:18:28,980 --> 09:18:33,860
Are you sitting literally? I thought this is a weebie ring as well. Are you giving me your weebie ring?

11844
09:18:35,380 --> 09:18:37,380
Am I putting shoes on?

11845
09:18:38,020 --> 09:18:40,020
Okay, I got shoes on

11846
09:18:40,020 --> 09:18:42,020
I got gloves on

11847
09:18:42,340 --> 09:18:49,300
Oh, now I look like I really work. I think it's a helpful tool that'll come in handy later. That's so ominous

11848
09:18:49,860 --> 09:18:52,580
This is a helpful tool that'll help you later. What do you mean?

11849
09:18:53,380 --> 09:18:56,020
That's so ominous. What am I supposed to do about that?

11850
09:19:00,180 --> 09:19:01,460
I

11851
09:19:01,460 --> 09:19:04,100
Get you miss 100% of the shots, but some people

11852
09:19:04,980 --> 09:19:10,180
Just don't get it. It was a shame like I felt really bad for the Japanese girl

11853
09:19:10,180 --> 09:19:12,900
She was nothing but polite well mannered

11854
09:19:13,940 --> 09:19:16,260
Um, and like obviously I can't say too much of the message

11855
09:19:16,260 --> 09:19:20,180
But basically she'd worked in another agency before it didn't work out

11856
09:19:20,820 --> 09:19:26,740
Um, and she was like really excited at the prospect and she already had all the experience type thing

11857
09:19:27,460 --> 09:19:30,500
But she just couldn't speak English and I can't be like

11858
09:19:31,540 --> 09:19:37,860
Given lead script examples where she mimics what I'm saying because then she's gonna end up just sounding like me type thing

11859
09:19:37,860 --> 09:19:43,220
When it comes to trying to mix it was a shame. It was a shame because it would have been a very interesting mix

11860
09:19:47,860 --> 09:19:53,460
You can stack donuts on it Japanese branch went no, there will be no spin-offs

11861
09:19:54,580 --> 09:19:56,980
absolutely no spin-offs that feel or

11862
09:19:58,100 --> 09:19:59,380
um

11863
09:19:59,380 --> 09:20:06,580
I am I am three gens and I am done. I have nothing else to produce or give to this beautiful world

11864
09:20:06,740 --> 09:20:08,740
I will give my daughters

11865
09:20:09,060 --> 09:20:10,580
um

11866
09:20:10,580 --> 09:20:16,980
My gen one my gen two my gen three and I am done. I cannot handle anymore. I am I'm at capacity

11867
09:20:17,380 --> 09:20:19,380
There is too much lights off

11868
09:20:19,540 --> 09:20:23,620
Plappening happen. I can't keep up with you as refluence. I can't keep up with you

11869
09:20:24,340 --> 09:20:25,300
um

11870
09:20:25,300 --> 09:20:30,580
Someone was worried about a male branch. I assure you that male branch idea is dead in the ditch

11871
09:20:30,660 --> 09:20:32,660
I am not even touching it with a 10-foot pole

11872
09:20:33,940 --> 09:20:35,940
um

11873
09:20:36,580 --> 09:20:39,140
Someone asked I did get a few inquiries

11874
09:20:39,700 --> 09:20:44,500
On the website saying are you interested in doing a safer work branch?

11875
09:20:45,220 --> 09:20:47,220
The answer is no

11876
09:20:47,700 --> 09:20:50,020
I don't mean to sound so blunt with that

11877
09:20:50,980 --> 09:20:51,940
But the answer is no

11878
09:20:51,940 --> 09:20:57,700
You might as well go to any other agency go apply to any other agency if you're if you're interested in the safer work

11879
09:20:57,860 --> 09:21:01,620
The reason why you don't get such a good cut in other agencies is because they're greedy cons

11880
09:21:01,620 --> 09:21:05,060
But that's okay though because you know is what it is and they point and

11881
09:21:05,940 --> 09:21:07,940
They point and beat around the bush

11882
09:21:07,940 --> 09:21:09,940
They point and beat around the bush

11883
09:21:10,740 --> 09:21:12,100
and

11884
09:21:12,100 --> 09:21:18,100
Safer work branch kind of defeats the purpose literally like at that point might as well just start like

11885
09:21:19,540 --> 09:21:23,060
A whole different agency and all that jazz

11886
09:21:25,220 --> 09:21:30,020
But I am done. I have experienced it. It's been fun

11887
09:21:30,580 --> 09:21:34,740
Um Vila is my child and so are my daughters

11888
09:21:35,380 --> 09:21:40,020
And the reeflings are the father and I'm also pregnant with the reeflings for that asmr

11889
09:21:40,180 --> 09:21:42,580
And I forgot to commission that art. I've still not done it

11890
09:21:44,660 --> 09:21:46,660
Vila to electric boogaloo

11891
09:21:47,460 --> 09:21:51,140
But strongy with enough power you can reignite even a dying star

11892
09:21:52,820 --> 09:21:56,340
No latin american branch. No, I cannot do any

11893
09:21:57,300 --> 09:22:03,540
Uh alternative language speaking branches because I don't speak the language and I

11894
09:22:04,740 --> 09:22:10,580
Don't have any trusted advisors that I could overwhelm with the amount of work it takes

11895
09:22:11,060 --> 09:22:12,340
um

11896
09:22:12,340 --> 09:22:18,900
Like the split couldn't be as high if I needed someone on call 24 7 to translate what these girls are trying to

11897
09:22:19,380 --> 09:22:22,820
Say to me like it's just it's not possible. It's not possible

11898
09:22:23,380 --> 09:22:27,620
Or it's not possible for me possible for other agencies. Not yourself out, but

11899
09:22:28,180 --> 09:22:33,860
After three gents. I am done. I am helping the girls achieve their dreams as much as possible at that point

11900
09:22:33,940 --> 09:22:35,940
I have no interested in

11901
09:22:36,340 --> 09:22:44,740
Trying to infinitely expand and have a billion talents out of ones and no, that's just no it's so disrespectful as well to the

11902
09:22:45,620 --> 09:22:50,820
To the girls um just being like oh, but we're already throwing out the next gen some mailers

11903
09:22:50,980 --> 09:22:56,660
I'm broke. Oh, wait. Sorry. Sorry. Refling was trade. I'm sorry. Refling. Hold on. Let me trade. Let me put this away

11904
09:22:58,580 --> 09:23:00,580
Oh, sorry

11905
09:23:03,220 --> 09:23:05,700
No refling branch. What is that?

11906
09:23:07,780 --> 09:23:09,780
What even is that?

11907
09:23:10,420 --> 09:23:12,900
Moles? Wait, why is it a million?

11908
09:23:15,300 --> 09:23:17,300
What are you doing?

11909
09:23:18,180 --> 09:23:20,180
uh

11910
09:23:20,340 --> 09:23:22,340
The drip the drip

11911
09:23:23,140 --> 09:23:27,220
Other players accepted wait, you're giving me a million dollar

11912
09:23:27,940 --> 09:23:31,140
Million gp freaking what is it?

11913
09:23:32,260 --> 09:23:34,260
Oh

11914
09:23:34,260 --> 09:23:36,260
Oh, emi's not gonna like that

11915
09:23:37,780 --> 09:23:39,780
emi's gonna have a word with that

11916
09:23:40,900 --> 09:23:43,620
Oh, those are awful. Do you want these back?

11917

I gotta be honest chief. I think you can have these back here. Let me trade accept trade

11918
09:23:49,220 --> 09:23:51,220
Wait, how do I go back on the trade?

11919
09:23:51,940 --> 09:23:57,220
How do I get you flip flops? Wait, how do I give it back? I don't want them. They're scary

11920
09:23:59,860 --> 09:24:04,580
Emi's gonna be mad. Do you want it back? Where are you? I can't see you. Are you on me?

11921

Or she runs away with your mall shoes and runescape

11933

Oh, you're still streaming. Why are you sick of me already?

Please rest well. Yes. Anyone who needs to sleep, please rest well

09:25:30,180 --> 09:25:32,180
Hold on for another two hours

11937
09:25:32,260 --> 09:25:34,260
Then

11938
09:25:34,500 --> 09:25:36,500

Which is oh no free those rats. There's a me. Oh, she's shaking her hand at us

11943
09:25:57,700 --> 09:25:59,940
Why I order looking stance

11944
09:26:02,180 --> 09:26:05,140
At least this 30 minutes left for me. Maybe not much more though

11945
09:26:32,980 --> 09:26:38,580
You're gonna have to use hypnosis. Wait, I don't want to sleep though, but it's good for your health

11946
09:26:40,580 --> 09:26:42,580
Can't do it. It's evil

11947
09:26:43,700 --> 09:26:48,340
Fuck you. You tangled me. I tangled you. That was even ASMR. I was just me man

11948
09:26:49,700 --> 09:26:51,700
singing a little lullaby

11949
09:26:52,660 --> 09:26:53,700
I

11950
09:26:53,700 --> 09:26:59,460
Was streaming when I came a bed now I wake up and I can continue watching hell. Yeah

11951
09:27:01,700 --> 09:27:03,700
All of a sudden I feel super hyper

11952
09:27:03,700 --> 09:27:06,900
Well after the lullaby my favorite saying apologies if I butcher it

11953
09:27:07,700 --> 09:27:09,700
Oh as if I can read that

11954
09:27:09,940 --> 09:27:11,940
No, I'm trying to book

11955
09:27:12,980 --> 09:27:14,980
Serada

11956
09:27:17,140 --> 09:27:23,460
Flies do not enter a close mouth. Damn. They really said loose lips sink ships. I can't believe it

11957
09:27:24,100 --> 09:27:26,100
You almost got me

11958
09:27:26,100 --> 09:27:32,180
It was lovely though. Oh your whispers can tingle alone. I'll bet you like my whispers

11959
09:27:32,180 --> 09:27:34,180
I

11960
09:27:52,340 --> 09:27:55,620
I didn't mention then just made me imagine you as Gengar

11961
09:27:55,620 --> 09:27:57,620
Yeah

11962
09:28:00,260 --> 09:28:02,260
Gengar the epinosis

11963
09:28:05,140 --> 09:28:11,940
Might be the lullaby or the two kilograms of cocaine or just no, no, I'll sleep when moma sleeps

11964
09:28:13,620 --> 09:28:15,620
Just so lovely. Thank you. Thank you

11965
09:28:17,620 --> 09:28:22,420
When the stream ends emi and ac's memberships are gonna go

11966
09:28:22,900 --> 09:28:30,500
Live because I'm gonna put them live because I'm such a good little streamer

11967
09:28:32,740 --> 09:28:34,740
Such a good little streamer

11968
09:28:35,780 --> 09:28:38,100
It's dreamer. No, let me be a streamer

11969
09:28:39,780 --> 09:28:41,780
Manager, no, I'm a little manager

11970
09:28:42,420 --> 09:28:49,140
I just do the intern work and it keeps the stress off of them as long as the girl stress levels are low

11971
09:28:50,020 --> 09:28:52,420
And I will I will be very happy

11972
09:28:59,700 --> 09:29:06,180
The point is to consume hypno content so much it conditions you it will work eventually to me over a decade from when I

11973
09:29:06,420 --> 09:29:08,980
became interested in color felt my first return

11974
09:29:11,780 --> 09:29:13,780
It was drowsy

11975
09:29:14,740 --> 09:29:18,740
Yeah, I will my bed team is

11976
09:29:19,460 --> 09:29:25,220
5 p.m. Actually, it's 1 p.m. Right now and we've still got another

11977
09:29:26,580 --> 09:29:28,580
Two and a half hours. Yeah

11978
09:29:30,740 --> 09:29:32,740
So then that would take me to

11979
09:29:34,420 --> 09:29:38,020
4 p.m. So I have one hour basically to do all the

11980
09:29:38,660 --> 09:29:43,300
Stuff that I'm supposed to do. Um, and then I pass out

11981
09:29:43,780 --> 09:29:48,340
And then when I wake up I prepare for stream with a cup of honey tea

11982
09:29:48,740 --> 09:29:53,780
And then I open up crash bandicoot warped and make sure you guys can hear it and see it

11983
09:29:54,340 --> 09:30:01,780
And then we go again. Um, I believe tomorrow is eight hour stream. It's not endurance to finish the game. It's eight hours

11984
09:30:04,100 --> 09:30:07,140
Would it be mean to let you know you're 10% of the way to 99?

11985
09:30:07,140 --> 09:30:09,140
I

11986
09:30:12,740 --> 09:30:14,740
What

11987
09:30:16,340 --> 09:30:18,340
10% of the way

11988
09:30:20,580 --> 09:30:24,500
I thought I could get it finished this month. I don't think so

11989
09:30:28,420 --> 09:30:30,420
10% there. Oh, yay

11990
09:30:33,700 --> 09:30:36,020
Do you want to know the amount of xp required?

11991
09:30:37,620 --> 09:30:39,620
It's 13 million. Oh, I'm

11992
09:30:40,900 --> 09:30:45,860
10% of the way that so every million is like, I guess

11993
09:30:47,620 --> 09:30:51,460
Well, 1.3% is every million wait

11994
09:30:52,500 --> 09:30:54,500
Every million is 10.3%

11995
09:30:56,020 --> 09:30:59,060
Surely that's how it works. Is that how math works?

11996
09:31:01,700 --> 09:31:03,700
Break it down into chunks. Um

11997
09:31:04,420 --> 09:31:09,780
9 to 8 to 99 is like 1.2 million. Oh my god

11998
09:31:11,220 --> 09:31:15,860
Peanut the force is here. You should be able to do it

11999
09:31:18,020 --> 09:31:22,900
Every 1.3 million is 10% okay, so we're just over 10% now

12000
09:31:23,700 --> 09:31:28,100
Okay, that's not bad. We'll finish the sword fish

12001
09:31:28,740 --> 09:31:32,820
I think we can finish the sword fish before the end of the stream and then

12002
09:31:33,940 --> 09:31:38,980
We'll tackle wine. I'm going to buy a bunch of wine stuff

12003
09:31:39,620 --> 09:31:42,740
And we're basically gonna watch a movie

12004
09:31:44,980 --> 09:31:48,420
While we do it so we can all giggle and laugh at movie

12005
09:31:49,300 --> 09:31:51,540
Um, I think we'll do john wick

12006
09:31:52,980 --> 09:31:56,100
This is perfect zatsu content and rambling. Yeah

12007
09:31:56,980 --> 09:32:01,380
I did look at marshmallow. I don't know if I have many more marshmallows a lot of the marshmallows

12008
09:32:01,380 --> 09:32:05,380
I can't really read for obvious reason because reeflings are a little

12009
09:32:07,940 --> 09:32:10,180
Okay, let me check if there are any more

12010
09:32:11,460 --> 09:32:13,460
Marchmallows

12011
09:32:13,460 --> 09:32:17,620
Oh, okay, definitely a few more marshmallows. Hold on. Let's go. Uh

12012
09:32:21,220 --> 09:32:24,740
Oh, no, are you guys berating me because I lost four in a row?

12013
09:32:28,900 --> 09:32:30,900
Uh

12014
09:32:32,340 --> 09:32:34,340
Uh

12015
09:32:36,100 --> 09:32:38,820
I was split between giving my veal or membership

12016
09:32:40,260 --> 09:32:42,760
Cherry to emmy or to mercy

12017
09:32:43,460 --> 09:32:48,180
Because each of the girls are intense young dairies and don't want their fans to flirt with other girls

12018
09:32:48,660 --> 09:32:53,700
Then I remembered all the good times from hanging in your stream and I saw the third option you me

12019
09:32:53,940 --> 09:32:56,180
No, you're supposed to support my daughters

12020
09:32:56,740 --> 09:33:02,100
Strong eat sometimes during or after emmy's membership opening. I'm going to make a decision. You're a strong prick

12021
09:33:02,260 --> 09:33:04,260
I won't overlook you when deciding

12022
09:33:04,420 --> 09:33:08,740
Reefling or or pinpal or snippet whatever one you may be

12023
09:33:09,300 --> 09:33:13,860
Um, please always support my daughters over me if you can only support one at a time

12024
09:33:14,500 --> 09:33:22,100
Um, please pick either daughter if you struggle to pick between a daughter pick the design the default design

12025
09:33:22,180 --> 09:33:23,860
You like the most

12026
09:33:23,860 --> 09:33:28,180
That's the easiest the most simplistic way to do it because your brain will either go

12027
09:33:28,340 --> 09:33:32,020
I like this design the most or I like that. Oh my god. I thought Gimli was in the room there

12028
09:33:32,420 --> 09:33:36,340
I had a heart attack. I was getting nervous about spiders. Uh, I don't like them

12029
09:33:36,740 --> 09:33:43,860
Um, I'm also just a spider like a working in the room. Can we add pictures or videos to marshmallows? Um, you can via

12030
09:33:44,660 --> 09:33:46,660
cat box

12031
09:33:46,900 --> 09:33:48,660
um

12032
09:33:48,660 --> 09:33:53,620
If you want to show me something you have to do the link and you have to make it easy

12033
09:33:54,340 --> 09:33:56,340
Just remove the dot

12034
09:33:56,500 --> 09:34:01,300
And put dot in brackets because if you do it any other way, I'm too paprika and can't open it off

12035
09:34:01,380 --> 09:34:04,820
It's literally a logic puzzle to open up a link when you don't give me the link

12036
09:34:06,660 --> 09:34:12,660
It's okay strongy. We'll comfort you after this losses. They're there head pads. Good girl. Hey, wait didn't

12037
09:34:13,460 --> 09:34:16,660
Did you want us to help with those frustrations? Would you like to be on?

12038
09:34:16,740 --> 09:34:20,900
Whoa, I can't read that. Whoa, I can't read that

12039
09:34:27,060 --> 09:34:29,060
Okay

12040
09:34:31,860 --> 09:34:36,020
Can you read that in lads can you read that in? Hey, that's uh, that's the offline

12041
09:34:36,740 --> 09:34:40,100
That's the offline one. You know what I'm saying? That's that's that's between me and offline

12042
09:34:41,860 --> 09:34:44,180
Uh, right. Let me let me scroll down to the next one

12043
09:34:45,140 --> 09:34:48,740
Hey strongy, just wanted to thank for all the fun streams. You're welcome. We've been

12044
09:34:49,380 --> 09:34:55,060
I've especially enjoyed your ASMR streams. Your voice and accent are just so pleasant to listen to. I you like that

12045
09:34:55,140 --> 09:34:57,140
I bet you do

12046
09:34:57,460 --> 09:35:00,500
I also look forward to the fun ways that you plan to mind break it. Oh

12047
09:35:01,380 --> 09:35:03,380
It's coming

12048
09:35:03,460 --> 09:35:07,140
Hope you and the girls are having a great time and go far with your content

12049
09:35:07,220 --> 09:35:10,420
Bruv, we're all in cloud nine like all of us are so happy

12050
09:35:10,980 --> 09:35:15,300
Um our monetization streams are about to be done me and mercy are done

12051
09:35:15,940 --> 09:35:20,260
Icy and emmy are next then it's she be

12052
09:35:20,900 --> 09:35:24,420
Then it should be a zero whenever it gets granted. I feel like it should happen now

12053
09:35:24,740 --> 09:35:31,860
I'm sorry strongy, but I choose you. You speak to me on a whole another level. I love you. Kamiyoshi. No, you can't call me kamiyoshi

12054
09:35:34,660 --> 09:35:39,540
Will you do more twitter mosaic responses to the marshmallows? Yes, I've been wanting to do it

12055
09:35:40,020 --> 09:35:43,940
And update it terribly terribly badly for a long time

12056
09:35:44,180 --> 09:35:49,220
Because I really enjoy writing the scenarios to you guys like when you guys give me like a little prompt or something

12057
09:35:49,700 --> 09:35:52,980
And I just take it way too far. It's my favorite thing to do

12058
09:35:55,140 --> 09:35:58,420
Yes, I will definitely be doing that again soon. It's just

12059
09:35:59,140 --> 09:36:05,780
Every I say this every stream as the dust settles and all the little mini side projects get pushed out the way

12060
09:36:06,020 --> 09:36:10,660
Then I can start to like really catch up because like whenever I do those two-hour streams

12061
09:36:10,900 --> 09:36:17,380
I'm catching up and like I'm literally going to the doctors after buckshot roulette and then I'll be healing up for a bit

12062
09:36:18,180 --> 09:36:20,180
um

12063
09:36:20,580 --> 09:36:22,180
so

12064
09:36:22,180 --> 09:36:28,420
ASMR with the viewer viewer beats you in a board game a bunch till we let you win and so then

12065
09:36:28,580 --> 09:36:31,780
Spacey time to celebrate the victory. Honestly, that's quite funny

12066
09:36:32,660 --> 09:36:34,660
um

12067
09:36:35,620 --> 09:36:40,740
You being so silly not very bright and cute at the same time makes me want to

12068
09:36:42,340 --> 09:36:44,660
Run and tackle you under the bed and cuddle you

12069
09:36:45,940 --> 09:36:50,180
I would hug you and roll around under the covers and never let you go. Where's can I explain how much I love you?

12070
09:36:50,180 --> 09:36:52,180
You're my sunshine. Oh, you're my sunshine

12071
09:36:53,380 --> 09:36:55,380
Refling

12072
09:36:55,380 --> 09:36:57,380
You like when I'm dumb

12073
09:36:58,100 --> 09:37:02,180
You like when I show how unbelievably brain dead I am. Yeah, is that what you like?

12074
09:37:05,620 --> 09:37:08,740
Sorry, but you're being hard locked as my oh, she does

12075
09:37:10,660 --> 09:37:12,660
We sure do

12076
09:37:13,460 --> 09:37:16,500
Allegedly, why is it so hard to play fricking connect for?

12077
09:37:18,740 --> 09:37:20,740
I don't know why it's so hard

12078
09:37:23,220 --> 09:37:28,580
Uh she be just woke up and said I woke up a bit ago dizzy but wanting to be ravaged

12079
09:37:28,900 --> 09:37:31,380
Okay, she be she be doing better with her migraine

12080
09:37:31,380 --> 09:37:38,660
You are more of a mother to me than my own parents and I hardly even know you you are welcome

12081
09:37:38,900 --> 09:37:41,220
well, I didn't mean you're welcome like that, but

12082
09:37:42,180 --> 09:37:44,180
um

12083
09:37:44,180 --> 09:37:46,180
sometimes

12084
09:37:46,500 --> 09:37:55,300
It's a bit sucky, but some people might not necessarily be the best parents and sometimes it's easier to just

12085
09:37:56,660 --> 09:37:58,660
take a deep breath

12086
09:37:58,660 --> 09:38:00,660
and sigh and say

12087
09:38:01,060 --> 09:38:03,460
They did the best with what they had

12088
09:38:04,340 --> 09:38:06,340
at the time with what they got

12089
09:38:07,060 --> 09:38:08,420
and

12090
09:38:08,420 --> 09:38:13,860
Sometimes it's not easy to swallow the truth and be like, oh that really wasn't as

12091
09:38:14,580 --> 09:38:16,420
nice because

12092
09:38:16,420 --> 09:38:22,740
You know when you watch media, it's like oh the loving parents. They're so supportive. They're so this or so that

12093
09:38:23,700 --> 09:38:30,500
Sometimes it's a hard pill to swallow to say that you drew an unlucky hand

12094
09:38:31,060 --> 09:38:37,540
And that might not necessarily mean you don't still share a love for your primary caregivers

12095
09:38:38,180 --> 09:38:39,140
um

12096
09:38:39,140 --> 09:38:46,740
But there are some phrases in the english language that's like the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb

12097
09:38:47,700 --> 09:38:52,020
Which basically just means the connections that you seek out in life

12098
09:38:52,740 --> 09:38:54,740
that are

12099
09:38:54,820 --> 09:38:56,820
outside of your family

12100
09:38:57,620 --> 09:39:00,980
Can be just as valid if not more loving

12101
09:39:01,540 --> 09:39:06,660
than family because you don't pick family you don't you don't pick these aspects and

12102
09:39:07,700 --> 09:39:09,700
sometimes it's just easier to

12103
09:39:11,140 --> 09:39:16,340
It's not easy to swallow the pill, but sometimes it's easier to just take a deep breath

12104
09:39:17,220 --> 09:39:19,780
Let out a big sigh and be like okay

12105
09:39:20,660 --> 09:39:22,660
That's just how it is and

12106
09:39:23,620 --> 09:39:25,620
I hope you're doing okay. Yeah

12107
09:39:25,780 --> 09:39:27,140
is

12108
09:39:27,140 --> 09:39:29,140
It sucks, but i'm i'm glad um

12109
09:39:30,340 --> 09:39:33,380
You can feel a degree of motherly love. Um

12110
09:39:34,580 --> 09:39:37,140
You know, I don't think anyone should be embarrassed or

12111
09:39:38,180 --> 09:39:43,140
Uh, what's the word kind of like it's only human nature to crave

12112
09:39:43,620 --> 09:39:44,580
um

12113
09:39:44,580 --> 09:39:49,380
to crave attention to crave love to create to crave

12114
09:39:49,940 --> 09:39:51,940
These positive reinforcers

12115
09:39:52,900 --> 09:39:57,700
That show that you're a part of a community that you're welcome that you're wanted

12116
09:39:57,860 --> 09:40:00,980
So don't ever you know, don't feel embarrassed about that

12117
09:40:01,460 --> 09:40:05,780
Just you know, if you're needing kind of a way to to put it away

12118
09:40:06,260 --> 09:40:10,180
Uh deep down inside you just want like one big sigh and say

12119
09:40:10,980 --> 09:40:17,220
Yeah, you know what that's fucked that situation's fucked, but i'm here. I'm doing it. I'm crushing life

12120
09:40:17,460 --> 09:40:19,460
You know, i've gotten through

12121
09:40:19,460 --> 09:40:25,380
The worst days of my life every every worst day of every experience yet. You're still here and you're still

12122
09:40:26,020 --> 09:40:32,500
Trucking along a little reefland and you're doing body. You're doing a body good job. You are so don't don't worry about it. All right

12123
09:40:33,380 --> 09:40:35,380
Don't worry about it. You're doing great

12124
09:40:38,980 --> 09:40:40,980
Fantastic

12125
09:40:41,460 --> 09:40:43,460
Um

12126
09:40:43,860 --> 09:40:50,020
Will you for lack of better words recycle scripts with slight adjustments for the other girls?

12127
09:40:50,660 --> 09:40:56,980
I no longer am the script master, but the answer is no they're all being like created from scratch

12128
09:40:57,700 --> 09:40:58,340
um

12129
09:40:58,340 --> 09:40:59,620
Now they

12130
09:40:59,620 --> 09:41:05,300

Um, give me that schwanz. Um, there's only so many ways you can see it, so

09:43:01,380 --> 09:43:02,500
um

12158
09:43:02,580 --> 09:43:05,780
77 you're now at my level and I played for like eight years

12159
09:43:08,580 --> 09:43:12,260
What there's that saying it was like took four years to do this

12160
09:43:13,060 --> 09:43:15,060
VTuber does it in one week

12161
09:43:15,620 --> 09:43:20,980
Took four took this man four years VTuber comes in and does it in a week. I say that as if

12162
09:43:21,620 --> 09:43:24,740
Reflings didn't like hand me all of the fish and everything

12163
09:43:26,020 --> 09:43:28,020
laughs in agony

12164
09:43:28,180 --> 09:43:30,180
Got that pop-up answer my question

12165
09:43:31,140 --> 09:43:36,820
Guess that pop-up answer my question you can now cook blood runes or can make haggis

12166
09:43:39,780 --> 09:43:44,340
Get this woman on rune crafting absolutely not we are not touching rune crafting when a 10 foot pole

12167
09:43:48,340 --> 09:43:50,340
Wow, let's see. Where were they?

12168
09:43:50,660 --> 09:43:54,980
Yes, please don't ever worry about not being able to donate give money all that jazz

12169
09:43:55,460 --> 09:44:00,020
Free content always coming rough life is freaking hard, especially

12170
09:44:00,900 --> 09:44:02,900
economically in these times

12171
09:44:03,220 --> 09:44:04,900
and

12172
09:44:04,900 --> 09:44:10,340
Where greed is just everywhere hold on that tin foil hat's coming back hold on no go away tin foil hat

12173
09:44:11,700 --> 09:44:15,300
Just in times like this it is much more valuable

12174
09:44:16,420 --> 09:44:17,540
and

12175
09:44:17,540 --> 09:44:19,540
much more

12176
09:44:20,260 --> 09:44:25,460
Much more valuable much more important that you look after yourself

12177
09:44:26,260 --> 09:44:33,060
That you look after whatever situation you're in if you have debts you pay them off if you need a sweet treat

12178
09:44:33,620 --> 09:44:35,860
you indulge in it and if you

12179
09:44:37,220 --> 09:44:40,740
You know after work you need to play video games to de-stress

12180
09:44:41,140 --> 09:44:45,220
Make sure your internet bill is paid and make sure your electricity bill is paid

12181
09:44:45,460 --> 09:44:48,660
So you have access to these abilities to de-stress

12182
09:44:49,140 --> 09:44:54,740
To handle the work day to handle the workflow or to handle any life stresses that you might be going through

12183
09:44:55,220 --> 09:44:59,140
Um, there are just countless situations where people are

12184
09:44:59,780 --> 09:45:03,860
Just going through hell on earth on the inside and on the outside

12185
09:45:03,940 --> 09:45:09,220
They look perfectly fine and you'd have absolutely no clue what on earth is going on with them and you know

12186
09:45:10,100 --> 09:45:11,540
the last thing

12187
09:45:11,540 --> 09:45:13,540
people want to be dealing with is

12188
09:45:14,180 --> 09:45:14,740
um

12189
09:45:14,740 --> 09:45:22,100
Just the stress that builds and builds and builds and builds and builds until you pop people pop people have burnout

12190
09:45:22,180 --> 09:45:25,860
people have breakdowns like you can pop so easily so make sure

12191
09:45:26,660 --> 09:45:30,260
And you know you're looking after yourself first because at the end of the day

12192
09:45:30,340 --> 09:45:32,660
You are the most important person in your life

12193
09:45:33,140 --> 09:45:39,220
And that's the fact for everyone's pov right now. You are the most important person in your life. It's the way it works

12194
09:45:39,380 --> 09:45:46,420
Okay, and you have to look after yourself first. You have to make sure that you're feeling good. You have to you have to enable yourself

12195
09:45:46,980 --> 09:45:48,980
and

12196
09:45:49,060 --> 09:45:54,180
To be on your prime like I'll I'll wipe out mazl's hierarchy and needs right now. Do not think I won't do it

12197
09:45:54,180 --> 09:45:56,900
I will start a psychology lecture or right this second

12198
09:45:57,460 --> 09:46:04,340
I'll put my teacher's glasses on and it is very important to meet your needs first before you ever try and meet the needs of someone else

12199
09:46:04,420 --> 09:46:07,060
however, uh, the exception is that a

12200
09:46:07,460 --> 09:46:13,140
The stupid sentence I've heard is a love yourself first before you love someone else or something like that. Shut the fuck up

12201
09:46:13,140 --> 09:46:16,740
That's the most nonsense statement I've ever heard. Everyone can share the love to any degree

12202
09:46:17,700 --> 09:46:19,700
That's my take on that sense. Um

12203
09:46:21,780 --> 09:46:26,980
You can share love at any point it is simple to share a little bit of love glasses

12204
09:46:27,700 --> 09:46:31,460
toggle no not glasses toggle I never got glasses on my model

12205
09:46:32,100 --> 09:46:34,100
Uh

12206
09:46:34,420 --> 09:46:38,500
This is helping me procrastinate my final. How do you oh no

12207
09:46:39,620 --> 09:46:43,940
That's not good. Damn. I fell asleep for 13 hours and you're still screaming. Yeah

12208
09:46:44,660 --> 09:46:46,660
Do you need iron supplements?

12209
09:46:48,820 --> 09:46:50,820
Sleeping for 13 hours

12210
09:46:51,060 --> 09:46:57,220
Indicates low iron. You might want to get that checked out or just start taking iron supplements. Go for it. Have fun

12211
09:46:58,020 --> 09:47:00,020
You can only take one dose a day anyway

12212
09:47:00,980 --> 09:47:07,220
Cooking was my first 99 in old school runescape. Are you gonna end up making wine? It's expensive, but the fastest

12213
09:47:07,220 --> 09:47:09,860
Yes, we are doing wine. I stopped doing wine

12214
09:47:10,420 --> 09:47:13,620
Reflings gave me a ton of fish. So I'm cooking all the fish first

12215
09:47:14,180 --> 09:47:15,140
Wine

12216
09:47:15,140 --> 09:47:19,300
It requires a lot of focus like I keep missing the fermentation

12217
09:47:19,780 --> 09:47:21,780
period for an xp bomb

12218
09:47:22,100 --> 09:47:24,100
and

12219
09:47:24,420 --> 09:47:26,420
I used to sleep when giving a ton of blood

12220
09:47:27,060 --> 09:47:31,860
And they said I had high iron. Oh, I don't know what high iron would be. How much red meat do you eat?

12221
09:47:32,740 --> 09:47:34,660
I didn't actually sleep

12222
09:47:34,660 --> 09:47:38,740
You just still streamed for such a long time. Oh, okay. I comprehend. I understand

12223
09:47:40,100 --> 09:47:41,700
Comprehendi

12224
09:47:41,700 --> 09:47:43,700
It's just sweet. Comprehendi

12225
09:47:44,580 --> 09:47:46,580
Drink less blood. Are you a vampire?

12226
09:47:48,260 --> 09:47:52,580
If you want the truth anything that might take you away from us

12227
09:47:52,740 --> 09:47:57,380
Makes me want to cry, but I'm not going what can take me away from you

12228
09:47:58,180 --> 09:48:00,180
Motherfucker. I am veiler

12229
09:48:01,460 --> 09:48:05,220
Nothing can stop me other than an internet connection. That's about it

12230
09:48:05,860 --> 09:48:08,260
You know, you don't have to worry about me going anywhere. Nothing

12231
09:48:08,980 --> 09:48:13,300
Nothing can perish me and we already know what we say to death. We say to death not today motherfucker

12232
09:48:13,460 --> 09:48:19,140
I've got refluence. Okay, and they've got me and we've got a lot. We've got a lot of time to make up for okay

12233
09:48:20,260 --> 09:48:21,780
um

12234
09:48:21,780 --> 09:48:27,140
Got another gym post. I don't know what I'd do without you. Don't panic refler. I'm not going anywhere

12235
09:48:27,780 --> 09:48:29,780
Don't panic stop panicking

12236
09:48:33,300 --> 09:48:41,780
The deadly tone fiction do you know how that's how bob marley passed away apparently he rejected penicillin because of his beliefs

12237
09:48:42,260 --> 09:48:47,780
And bob marley that this is love this is love this is love that's that feeling

12238
09:48:48,420 --> 09:48:52,420
That singer passed away because he rejected penicillin

12239
09:48:54,660 --> 09:48:57,140
Why do I keep opening that? I don't even know how I'm doing that

12240
09:48:58,420 --> 09:49:00,020
um

12241
09:49:00,020 --> 09:49:04,580
Yeah, like saws i'm snorting penicillin for free like you don't have to tell me twice if I need it

12242
09:49:05,860 --> 09:49:11,220

12243
09:49:11,780 --> 09:49:13,940

12248
09:49:29,540 --> 09:49:31,940
Unending stamina. Good. I didn't try that

12249
09:49:32,820 --> 09:49:35,140
Uh, yeah, I was freaking I was

12250
09:49:36,100 --> 09:49:38,020
clapping

12251
09:49:38,020 --> 09:49:42,820
I was clapping without my hands asmr and then right at the end of it. I was like, oh

12252
09:49:43,140 --> 09:49:45,540
I was a little cheeky cat there might as well

12253
09:49:46,180 --> 09:49:51,380
I'm allergic to that stuff. Yes penicillin can be incredibly deadly for some people which is crazy

12254
09:49:52,260 --> 09:49:53,300
um

12255
09:49:53,300 --> 09:49:58,340
I'm pretty sure the guy who discovered penicillin did it by a complete accident as well, which was rather interesting

12256
09:49:58,660 --> 09:49:59,620
uh

12257
09:49:59,620 --> 09:50:01,220
There's just complete accident

12258
09:50:01,220 --> 09:50:04,740
casually discover something that saves literally millions of lives cat

12259
09:50:04,820 --> 09:50:10,500
Uh, you know, just get a little casual probably in the billions as time goes on easily a billion lives saved because of

12260
09:50:10,980 --> 09:50:13,940
little accidental petri dish discovery. Um

12261
09:50:15,700 --> 09:50:17,700
It's really fascinating fascinating

12262
09:50:19,060 --> 09:50:24,180
Should maybe go into the lore of biology. Uh, no should go into the lore the start of modern modern

12263
09:50:24,740 --> 09:50:27,540
The wonders of modern medicine. Nah, I'm mercy

12264
09:50:29,460 --> 09:50:30,900
Not yet

12265
09:50:30,900 --> 09:50:36,740
How many things can you take at a time? I don't know refland. Should we meet up at convention and find out?

12266
09:50:40,740 --> 09:50:42,740
I

12267
09:50:44,260 --> 09:50:46,260
Would you make us a hypnosis

12268
09:50:46,340 --> 09:50:48,340
To get as hard just by hearing oh

12269
09:50:49,380 --> 09:50:55,300
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that part out loud. Sorry. Sorry. I'm forgetting to censor. I'm forgetting to censor

12270
09:50:55,460 --> 09:50:57,460
I've been streaming for a hot second now

12271
09:50:59,460 --> 09:51:06,820
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that out loud. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm supposed to censor what I say

12272
09:51:10,820 --> 09:51:12,820
Oh

12273
09:51:14,420 --> 09:51:15,620
Wow

12274
09:51:15,620 --> 09:51:20,660
Okay, let me try again gas my nots might not say so Richard. We're on a list. Um

12275
09:51:21,780 --> 09:51:27,940
What would you make as a hypnosis session to get a the tentacle giving a standing ovation?

12276
09:51:28,900 --> 09:51:31,940
Uh, just by hearing your voice and have the strongest ink

12277
09:51:33,380 --> 09:51:37,940
When we hear you think that's an interesting one. I wouldn't mind giving that a tackle

12278
09:51:37,940 --> 09:51:39,940
Um

12279
09:51:45,940 --> 09:51:53,540
I'll see so the four part series is one of the first attempts I have ever recorded it is not very good

12280
09:51:53,620 --> 09:51:57,300
I'll just say that right now. It's not go away chat. It's my wife now

12281
09:51:58,660 --> 09:52:03,940
Um, I will say that the four free to access audios are my first ever attempt

12282
09:52:04,020 --> 09:52:10,900
I'm not very satisfied with them looking back on them already even though I only produced them like a month and a bit ago. Um

12283
09:52:12,740 --> 09:52:17,460
So do give me patience to kind of learn what works what feedback I get. Um

12284
09:52:19,300 --> 09:52:21,700
I'm very shy, but if you wanted me to

12285
09:52:23,300 --> 09:52:28,740
Mm-hmm in the middle of a crowded city in broad daylight, I would do it. That's how much I care about

12286
09:52:29,060 --> 09:52:33,220
You break the law for me. Do you know it's against the law to do that stuff?

12287
09:52:34,340 --> 09:52:36,340
I wonder when you break the law

12288
09:52:38,740 --> 09:52:40,740
Mm

12289
09:52:41,300 --> 09:52:45,780
Mummy I haven't inked in days because I've been spending all my weekend hours watching veiler boy

12290
09:52:47,220 --> 09:52:50,180
I can't help but support the girls because they make me so happy

12291
09:52:50,820 --> 09:52:52,020
And I don't

12292
09:52:52,020 --> 09:52:56,500
To well livestream it. I'm so pent up. I need mummy. Tell me what to do

12293
09:52:57,220 --> 09:52:59,220
Do you have any of the girls patreon?

12294
09:53:00,180 --> 09:53:03,140
Or if you're a pin pal emmy has a really good funny canton

12295
09:53:06,180 --> 09:53:10,740
Uh, I don't think I have a I don't have a full audio yet. That's accessible

12296
09:53:12,420 --> 09:53:14,420
Wow

12297
09:53:17,620 --> 09:53:19,620
Just ink into the board

12298
09:53:21,460 --> 09:53:24,340
Who goes yeah, oh did that do it for you? Yeah, you like that

12299
09:53:25,140 --> 09:53:28,340
I swallowed it all and then and then did a big old burp at the end

12300
09:53:32,900 --> 09:53:35,940
Day 10 of eating celery. No, we have a set up

12301
09:53:37,540 --> 09:53:39,540
Did I say that? I think I might have read that one already

12302
09:53:40,180 --> 09:53:47,300
Stop eating celery for me. It's terrible. It's it's just like better water in a solid form

12303
09:53:47,300 --> 09:53:49,300
Um

12304
09:53:51,140 --> 09:53:53,140
Parable

12305
09:53:59,540 --> 09:54:02,340
The sucky five bucks asking for a friend

12306
09:54:06,580 --> 09:54:12,740
Stony, I'm really sorry. I tried very hard, but I just couldn't I watched live streams and vods and listened to audios

12307
09:54:12,820 --> 09:54:16,980
None of our daughters do it for me. I keep coming back to you. Hope you understand. You're my community

12308
09:54:16,980 --> 09:54:18,980
I'll stop

12309
09:54:19,780 --> 09:54:25,460
I don't know how you're gonna come in with me. I still support them however I can forever. You're beefling all reefland

12310
09:54:25,860 --> 09:54:28,900
Thank you for you know, thank you for giving them a shot

12311
09:54:30,660 --> 09:54:32,180
I would say

12312
09:54:32,180 --> 09:54:38,900
Sheevy is like incredibly close to me like mentally and personality wise pretty close

12313
09:54:38,980 --> 09:54:44,340
Unless I'm like completely like misreader, but I'd say she's probably the closest

12314
09:54:45,300 --> 09:54:48,900
Uh, personality wise and easiest to consume

12315
09:54:54,180 --> 09:54:58,100
Uh, I would love to share some fanfics, but I don't know if it's appropriate even allowed you can

12316
09:54:58,660 --> 09:55:04,660
But if it is weird, I submit them. Uh, I think you can do pace bin links. I think those are safe

12317
09:55:06,180 --> 09:55:08,180
Hi strongy, hi reefland

12318
09:55:09,140 --> 09:55:15,220
Did you know the term architect and features and comes from the irish actor pierce

12319
09:55:16,020 --> 09:55:20,980
Ro Brossnan who is rumored to have intentionally made his wife

12320
09:55:21,940 --> 09:55:23,140
Gain

12321
09:55:23,140 --> 09:55:27,060
100 pounds over the course of 20 years the term itself is from a quote

12322
09:55:27,700 --> 09:55:29,860
Made on the architects of peace

12323
09:55:30,580 --> 09:55:37,300
Home page a world without wills is too terrible to imagine. He did not write a book and call it that

12324
09:55:38,900 --> 09:55:44,500
Stop is that why he did wait is that from a book he wrote?

12325
09:55:47,140 --> 09:55:49,780
Oh my god, that's a racist

12326
09:55:50,580 --> 09:55:53,060
That's outrageous, but really funny

12327
09:55:56,580 --> 09:55:58,580
Okay

12328
09:55:58,580 --> 09:56:03,060
I like how ac is sweet and emmy is false to the wall and same

12329
09:56:03,780 --> 09:56:07,460
I will continue myself right now. Go to sleep

12330
09:56:09,220 --> 09:56:11,220
Hi strongy your way of

12331
09:56:12,260 --> 09:56:17,460
Gentle talking is one of my favorite triggers. I think if you did scott's wobble bars, it would be amazing

12332
09:56:20,820 --> 09:56:24,340
Is there a way to control my who while on stream on youtube?

12333
09:56:25,300 --> 09:56:29,140
Funny you mentioned that I thought about doing that, but I think it would like to be on banjo

12334
09:56:30,260 --> 09:56:32,260
and

12335
09:56:33,620 --> 09:56:35,620
I

12336
09:56:37,220 --> 09:56:39,220
Have you considered using

12337
09:56:40,420 --> 09:56:45,220
Bitmosis to plant suggestions that are wholly positive and affirming for the viewer

12338
09:56:45,700 --> 09:56:49,860
Something to encourage them when they're down to give them that little push when they're low

12339
09:56:50,500 --> 09:56:56,420
Don't don't want to do the dishes strongy would want you to don't want to cook and just want to order out strongy

12340
09:56:56,420 --> 09:57:02,820
Would want you to cook strongy would want me to live my best life. That's interesting. I'm wondering

12341
09:57:03,620 --> 09:57:07,780
If I could do a put in you to sleep asmr

12342
09:57:08,580 --> 09:57:11,300
but it's secretly hypnosis and then

12343
09:57:12,180 --> 09:57:16,660
After you've fallen asleep, then I would do like that kind of

12344
09:57:17,780 --> 09:57:19,780
in

12345
09:57:19,780 --> 09:57:21,780
In in planting

12346
09:57:22,900 --> 09:57:26,980
You've got me thinking a little bit when you got me thinking the cogs are turning

12347
09:57:28,740 --> 09:57:31,140
You got me at help you go to sleep. Yes, I think

12348
09:57:31,700 --> 09:57:36,740
You could do it if you established triggers outside of youtube and then use some in you

12349
09:57:38,740 --> 09:57:45,220
I see is way more insane. I thought me was uh having fun

12350
09:57:48,500 --> 09:57:55,620
I see just yeah, she doesn't like sharing on g fog sans sense or something that uh has been sent somewhere else. She doesn't like that

12351
09:57:56,180 --> 09:58:01,300
That would be perfect imprinting. Oh my god

12352
09:58:08,180 --> 09:58:10,180
What is deceit too

12353
09:58:14,660 --> 09:58:16,660
I'm about to get pranked when I look off on us

12354
09:58:18,500 --> 09:58:20,500
Bank the banker

12355
09:58:22,980 --> 09:58:24,980
Why do you do that I'm getting

12356
09:58:25,860 --> 09:58:27,860
I

12357
09:58:36,020 --> 09:58:38,020
Is a real game

12358
09:58:45,140 --> 09:58:48,100
The c2 has just released its free to play update

12359
09:58:48,180 --> 09:58:53,860
So I'm making an updated guide for it as there are many new things around the map whether that be players

12360
09:58:54,100 --> 09:58:59,060
Points below about 50 sanity one grab from a terror will kill it

12361
09:58:59,620 --> 09:59:04,180
Is it where wait if I'm getting chased by a werewolf the streaming gonna end good that's on something

12362
09:59:04,660 --> 09:59:06,660
honey soaked

12363
09:59:06,980 --> 09:59:11,140
Is it am I getting chased by a werewolf in that game? That's terrible. All of us are gonna be freaking

12364
09:59:11,860 --> 09:59:16,740
Male on stream me. Oh, sorry. I'm looking at a how to play deceit to full gay 2024

12365
09:59:17,460 --> 09:59:19,460
My apologies. Sorry

12366
09:59:20,180 --> 09:59:26,740
Um, all right, that was loud. Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. My bad. I was just trying to see what the gameplay was about

12367
09:59:28,740 --> 09:59:30,740
There's werewolves

12368
09:59:33,140 --> 09:59:36,100
Bro sounded nice though. I mean we have every physical

12369
09:59:36,980 --> 09:59:42,020
Come come on. I was just loud my apologies. Don't need to jump serious

12370
09:59:43,460 --> 09:59:48,340
We're at 2000 swordfish. Can I do it? Do we have enough time?

12371
09:59:50,420 --> 09:59:53,540
Cutting it close cutting it close. I think it's possible

12372
09:59:56,580 --> 10:00:04,020
Science is a wonderful thing like the scientist Fritz Harba who with Carl Bosch invented the harbour Bosch process to synthesize

12373
10:00:04,260 --> 10:00:11,460
Ammonia since then it has been possible to supply millions of people with food and toxic gas and chemical warfare

12374
10:00:13,300 --> 10:00:16,580
I'm sure the government would never poison its citizens on purpose

12375
10:00:17,540 --> 10:00:22,900
No, that's it. Give me the tin foil hat back on. I'm about to tell you what american have done as people

12376
10:00:24,020 --> 10:00:26,740
Thank you iron reaper for the 20 my goodness

12377
10:00:28,100 --> 10:00:31,620
You sure you give a lot of money. Yeah, you sure everything's okay

12378
10:00:32,740 --> 10:00:34,180
um

12379
10:00:34,180 --> 10:00:39,780
You got figure out who the infected are and either kill them or do the task and escape without dying

12380
10:00:39,860 --> 10:00:43,060
You either try and portray your friends could be cool. I'm addicted to this

12381
10:00:43,860 --> 10:00:45,620
hmm

12382
10:00:45,620 --> 10:00:49,460
Well, if I'm getting chased by a werewolf, whatever happens. I'm gonna just let it happen

12383
10:00:50,260 --> 10:00:52,260
I

12384
10:00:53,860 --> 10:00:58,740
Uh, scrawny you're gonna get all logged out in 52 minutes unless you hot wait actually

12385
10:01:01,940 --> 10:01:04,260
Don't need to like purposely time out

12386
10:01:07,780 --> 10:01:10,340
Why why can't people be addicted to games

12387
10:01:10,580 --> 10:01:16,020
I'm an adult. I consent to being addicted to old-school runescape and playing with reefing

12388
10:01:16,660 --> 10:01:18,660
You can log back out in in as well. Yeah

12389
10:01:19,540 --> 10:01:25,060
I'll probably go for a tinkle break in an hour and make a cup of tea just for my throat

12390
10:01:26,020 --> 10:01:28,020
And unless I do it now

12391
10:01:32,420 --> 10:01:34,820
Carl Bosch not to be confused with Carl Bosch

12392
10:01:35,380 --> 10:01:42,180
You want some madness fuel? Look at the all all the times America has stuck its nose into

12393
10:01:44,180 --> 10:01:50,740
But did you ask her overlords? I know I never asked overlords for permission. Silly me. Silly me. Silly me streamer

12394
10:01:54,180 --> 10:01:55,780
Sure

12395
10:01:55,780 --> 10:01:57,780
Then you can just log back in I better

12396
10:01:58,900 --> 10:02:00,900
I better

12397
10:02:02,100 --> 10:02:04,100
What

12398
10:02:05,300 --> 10:02:07,300
Is

12399
10:02:07,620 --> 10:02:12,580
What is a pace been like? Oh, hey, oh, sorry

12400
10:02:14,580 --> 10:02:20,020
This sorry, this is what I said. It's my accent. You can't it's not your fault. It's my accent

12401
10:02:22,580 --> 10:02:24,580
The website is called paste bin

12402
10:02:27,140 --> 10:02:29,140
Off the bed rest well

12403
10:02:29,540 --> 10:02:35,220
Yeah, for anyone, please don't be worried if you need to say hey ho. I gotta go. Um, I am

12404
10:02:37,220 --> 10:02:38,500
I'm gonna keep

12405
10:02:38,500 --> 10:02:42,420
Hey, strongy day nine of keeping my tentacles off myself. Thank you for being you

12406
10:02:42,660 --> 10:02:45,140
I'm gonna keep going unless you or your audios do something for me

12407
10:02:45,620 --> 10:02:51,620
You're just having effect on me that I want to do better myself. I even think my mood has improved and I haven't gotten angry today

Never ask a woman to meet her age a man has salary or a country about the warm crime they committed literally

12417
10:03:30,740 --> 10:03:32,740

12419
10:03:36,980 --> 10:03:39,220
You know the one story I really don't like

12420
10:03:40,020 --> 10:03:45,460
Is the the guy they kept alive that got covered in radiation

12421
10:03:46,660 --> 10:03:50,980
And they kept him alive and his body couldn't accept painkillers

12422
10:03:52,820 --> 10:03:54,020
Ah

12423
10:03:54,020 --> 10:04:01,460
They couldn't give him morphine and he was alive for like another two weeks just radiating away. Oh trade. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. My bad. Sorry

Volkswagen is so popular such a successful business. Whoa. What's this loot chest? How have I not seen this? I've been here for how long?

10:05:22,660 --> 10:05:24,660
Well, excuse you

12443
10:05:26,260 --> 10:05:29,300
Maybe some of us don't want wilderness loot keys

12444
10:05:33,620 --> 10:05:35,060
Our Fanta

10:05:35,060 --> 10:05:37,060

10:05:41,700 --> 10:05:49,540
Um, it was like, oh why I randomly have like German ancestry and I'm Argentinian and it's like rough

10:06:06,820 --> 10:06:08,820
How do you remember?

12453
10:06:10,340 --> 10:06:18,340
Me when I met my Argentinian friends great-grandfathers I was like, oh, hello big yes. Do be good. Yeah, okay

10:06:50,820 --> 10:06:56,980
Uh, I don't think we're gonna get 20 by the time the stream finish. I got two hours

12461
10:06:57,780 --> 10:07:00,980
We're cooking up the swordfish. Honestly the swordfish ain't that bad

12462
10:07:02,020 --> 10:07:07,540
140 isn't that bad per-cooked swordfish. I'm not mad at that. I know wine is a lot faster

12463
10:07:08,180 --> 10:07:14,580
And I understand wine is a lot faster, but this I'm I'm being cheering danger man being cheering

12464
10:07:16,660 --> 10:07:23,140
I have to be up early for lab. Yes, please rest well anyone who needs to sleep or you've got commitments

12466
10:07:30,500 --> 10:07:34,420
To what to go rest or go get stuff done

12467
10:07:34,820 --> 10:07:41,700
I am literally cooking these and then doing wine until it's time to until the vod is ready to explode

12468
10:07:42,420 --> 10:07:43,540
Um

12469
10:07:43,540 --> 10:07:50,180
If mersey is still playing harvester 2 she might be we might get a successful redirect into mersey or

12470
10:07:50,980 --> 10:07:56,100
I don't know if a zero is doing a part two of stray or she's gonna try and just stray in one run. Um

12471
10:07:58,100 --> 10:08:00,100
Uh

12472
10:08:00,340 --> 10:08:04,820
I thought it was less than two. Yeah, no, it oh well is less than two hours now

12473
10:08:05,060 --> 10:08:09,700
Boo youtube vods fix them so I can do 14 hour streams

12474
10:08:10,340 --> 10:08:12,340
Boo youtube

12475
10:08:13,140 --> 10:08:14,980
YouTube

12476
10:08:14,980 --> 10:08:18,820
Remember to sell cooked swordfish when you're done. We'll get a pretty penny

12477
10:08:20,180 --> 10:08:23,060
No night cuddles rest well sleepy heads

12478
10:08:24,180 --> 10:08:26,180
Then it goes to sleep

12479
10:08:26,420 --> 10:08:28,420
To sleep to sleep

12480
10:08:28,820 --> 10:08:32,820
It's time to go to sleep and rest your little head

12481
10:08:36,260 --> 10:08:38,260
Rest well

12482
10:08:41,300 --> 10:08:44,580
24 hour stream no if youtube's

12483
10:08:45,140 --> 10:08:50,340
Vods didn't break on 12 hours. I would definitely push 14 hour streams

12484
10:08:51,460 --> 10:08:53,460
um

12485
10:08:53,540 --> 10:08:55,540
Can you convert them into bank notes?

12486
10:08:56,420 --> 10:09:01,540
It kind of looks like you can only sell in stacks of 20. Yes, you can make bank notes

12487
10:09:02,020 --> 10:09:05,460
Uh in order to make a bank note you go to the bank

12488
10:09:05,780 --> 10:09:12,260
Don't do why you click there you go to the bank and then it says withdraw as and then you've got no

12489
10:09:13,220 --> 10:09:17,060
And then you click on it note all and then I produce a note

12490
10:09:17,220 --> 10:09:19,300
So you have to do it via the bank to do that

12491
10:09:19,540 --> 10:09:23,620
But I withdraw as items because I'm currently wanting to interact with the items that I'm pulling out

12492
10:09:24,420 --> 10:09:27,300
Hey, but that's how you do it and you can sell them all at one time

12493
10:09:29,780 --> 10:09:32,500
And don't worry that you didn't know because you don't know until you know

12494
10:09:37,220 --> 10:09:40,580
Enjoy the rest of the cooking stream. Love you strong. I love you replay

12495
10:09:41,540 --> 10:09:43,540
Rest well sleepy heads

12496
10:09:44,900 --> 10:09:50,420
You're allowed to you're allowed to go to sleep. I how what how did I what?

12497
10:09:50,980 --> 10:09:52,980

12498
10:09:53,540 --> 10:09:58,420
That splodge of cum be honest. What is that? What did you just oh?

12499
10:09:59,620 --> 10:10:03,700
What even was that? It looks like a piece of an alien or something

12500
10:10:05,540 --> 10:10:07,540
What did you just give me?

12501
10:10:08,340 --> 10:10:10,820
Did you just give me ink?

12502
10:10:15,540 --> 10:10:17,540
It's not ink

12503
10:10:18,020 --> 10:10:20,020
Oh, it's a wolf clock dumbass

12504
10:10:20,900 --> 10:10:22,900
What on earth that looks like ink?

12505
10:10:24,340 --> 10:10:30,020
Wow, oh my god. I'm like get it out of the wazoo like I'm getting so pimped out right now. I'm not being funny

12506
10:10:30,020 --> 10:10:35,060
I'm literally getting dressed up to go like to valador and like who to myself out honestly

12507
10:10:36,020 --> 10:10:41,380
Oh, no, it takes off my parrot. Oh, I can't have both. No, I need a rifling on my shoulder

12508
10:10:41,380 --> 10:10:44,100
Do you want the wolf back? I'll give you the wolf back. Where are you?

12509
10:10:45,300 --> 10:10:46,740
trade here

12510
10:10:46,740 --> 10:10:49,220
Take take the wolf back. I can't have it

12511
10:10:51,460 --> 10:10:56,820
I can't have the wolf you need to take it back because I need to have the rifling on my shoulder

12512
10:10:59,220 --> 10:11:01,220
Rip all yours. Thank you

12513
10:11:01,460 --> 10:11:05,060
Oh, that's raw swordfish

12514
10:11:09,460 --> 10:11:13,220
Maybe 30 minutes, I'll make a cup of tea because my voice is really starting to

12515
10:11:13,940 --> 10:11:18,180
What do you mean talking for 10 hours straight means my voice gets tired?

12516
10:11:18,500 --> 10:11:21,060
What that I've never that's ridiculous

12517
10:11:22,500 --> 10:11:24,820
That's ridiculous. I've never heard that before

12518
10:11:28,580 --> 10:11:30,580
Hydration

12519
10:11:31,780 --> 10:11:33,780
Mmm

12520
10:11:35,380 --> 10:11:37,380
Wow

12521
10:11:37,700 --> 10:11:41,940
Yes, I think I might make a cup of tea and the heat should hopefully help my vocal cords

12522
10:11:42,980 --> 10:11:47,940
But they're starting to feel it mr. Krabs seriously how frustrating

12523
10:11:51,460 --> 10:11:57,780
I think they say like one of the worst things you can drink is like dairy and fizzy juice when you have like long vocal activity

12524
10:11:58,100 --> 10:12:01,620
I'm like, oh, yes, the two worst things that I consume constantly

12525
10:12:03,140 --> 10:12:06,500
I have fizzy juice every day and I have a honey tea every day

12526
10:12:07,860 --> 10:12:11,780
I finally got my painting desk cleaned off time a pain. Oh my god

12527
10:12:13,540 --> 10:12:17,780
We should do a Bob Ross stream. Oh the wolf caught me down the floor

12528
10:12:20,420 --> 10:12:22,020
Okay, boom

12529
10:12:22,020 --> 10:12:24,020
we're at 1.8 for the

12530
10:12:24,580 --> 10:12:25,940
a

12531
10:12:26,020 --> 10:12:32,500
The fishy I guess once all these fishies are done. We'll sell them and then I'm just gonna buy a ton of wine

12532
10:12:33,300 --> 10:12:38,740
Strongly doesn't like my wolf coat. No, I do like it, but it removes the reef link from my shoulder

12533
10:12:38,740 --> 10:12:41,700
I know it looks nothing like a reef link, but I want to be parrot

12534
10:12:44,820 --> 10:12:47,460
I'm just working on cooking on my airman. Oh

12535
10:12:47,860 --> 10:12:49,860
I'm going

12536
10:12:52,740 --> 10:12:56,980
Yeah, those are the two literally you're not supposed to have any dairy and I have like milk honey tea

12537
10:12:57,860 --> 10:13:01,780
And then we compare paintings by the end. Honestly, I'm down for that

12538
10:13:02,980 --> 10:13:07,860
I saw a tweet where someone had to do vocal warm-ups like a singer. Oh, you're supposed to go like

12539
10:13:09,460 --> 10:13:11,780
I got carried to that because my friends my

12540
10:13:12,900 --> 10:13:14,900
I'm out of stamina. I'm out of juice

12541
10:13:15,460 --> 10:13:17,220
vocally I'm

12542
10:13:17,220 --> 10:13:19,220
Who goes there? I'm out of stamina

12543
10:13:21,060 --> 10:13:23,060
I saw yeah

12544
10:13:24,980 --> 10:13:30,580
Why what an interesting number of marshmallows literally 9-11, okay, dude

12545
10:13:32,180 --> 10:13:34,660

12546
10:13:36,580 --> 10:13:38,580
Uh

12547
10:13:40,420 --> 10:13:42,420
Have we just gained a far anon

12548
10:13:42,900 --> 10:13:44,900
I

12549
10:13:45,460 --> 10:13:51,700
Read this out loud or is this gonna have everyone saying what wtf? I think we've just gained a far anon

12550
10:13:53,860 --> 10:13:57,380
Please hold in your fars until it starts to get painful

12551
10:13:57,940 --> 10:14:03,140
And then blast them onto the make close up so we can hear your cheeks clapping beneath the

12552
10:14:03,940 --> 10:14:05,620
the basic

12553
10:14:05,620 --> 10:14:07,620
burst of brass

12554
10:14:07,780 --> 10:14:13,220
Actually, did she be far in a stream that I don't know if someone told me she be my vaginal

12555
10:14:18,820 --> 10:14:21,460
I mean I don't judge but I don't think I need you to do that

12556
10:14:22,500 --> 10:14:24,980
Look, we don't really we don't kink shame around here. Okay

12557
10:14:26,020 --> 10:14:28,020
She be and emi both did wait

12558
10:14:28,820 --> 10:14:30,820
Wait, and I've not clipped it

12559
10:14:31,060 --> 10:14:35,940
Stop, please tell me you guys clipped it so I can turn it into a short for some reason

12560
10:14:36,420 --> 10:14:42,100
hiccups burps in fart clips of vtubers get so many views

12561
10:14:42,180 --> 10:14:44,340
I don't even care if it embarrasses them

12562
10:14:44,900 --> 10:14:49,860
I'm like, I will get you your play button one way or another and I keep farting down that make young lady

12563
10:14:50,500 --> 10:14:52,500
Yes, Johnny

12564
10:14:53,540 --> 10:15:01,700
Um for some reason hiccups sneezes any normal bodily function when when vtuber does it hilarious views

12565
10:15:02,020 --> 10:15:04,020
And I'm like what it doesn't make any sense

12566
10:15:04,980 --> 10:15:06,980
And

12567
10:15:07,940 --> 10:15:11,460
Astrony milk in the clips literally though, I wonder why

12568
10:15:14,020 --> 10:15:16,020
Rappers absolutely

12569
10:15:19,620 --> 10:15:26,180
The emi one there should be a timestamp in the comments for it. Oh, thank god. Thank you timestampers. You helped me clip my gen mates

12570
10:15:27,860 --> 10:15:33,220
No, the buraptubers. No, I think we're I think peeler is definitely what we're at

12571
10:15:34,660 --> 10:15:39,540
Hi, strony. I just want to say I love you and I think you're perfect. Stop everything. You're perfect

12572
10:15:40,740 --> 10:15:45,940
See, I kissed you. That's how perfect you are. You can't deny the allegation

12573
10:15:47,380 --> 10:15:49,380
I'm done

12574
10:15:56,740 --> 10:16:01,380
Okay, oh my tummy's rumbling, but I think it's digested

12575
10:16:04,180 --> 10:16:06,180
Oh

12576
10:16:06,420 --> 10:16:12,660
Pea holding stream when are you a pin pal? Are you the one who convinced emi to do that on her stream?

12577
10:16:14,580 --> 10:16:17,380
It must have been you must have been you pin pal

12578
10:16:17,540 --> 10:16:21,300
I can I can smell you a male away pin pal

12579
10:16:22,340 --> 10:16:26,180
Got my stomachs making really weird noises about the 3d or migraine. I even heard all

12580
10:16:28,900 --> 10:16:30,900
Smell a pin pal

12581
10:16:34,260 --> 10:16:40,180
I can't believe how well that stream once is it. I've not seen it. Is it bad. Can you get put kidney stones from that?

12582
10:16:41,380 --> 10:16:44,020
I went to bed get up and you're still cooking these swordfish

12583
10:16:44,660 --> 10:16:48,420
There was five though. No, there was 10,000 swordfish

12584
10:16:49,460 --> 10:16:53,620
If I make 10,000 swordfish one stream that means I can do 10,000

12585
10:16:54,500 --> 10:16:58,580
Wine in one stream most likely if not more it means bod is

12586
10:16:59,700 --> 10:17:02,340
Back up actually did she cut something out of it?

12587
10:17:02,500 --> 10:17:05,220
I do not know I've been streaming unfortunately

12588
10:17:07,300 --> 10:17:13,780
Uh when I stream all day I have no clue what shenanigans the girls are getting up to in all honesty

12589
10:17:14,580 --> 10:17:16,580
um

12590
10:17:33,140 --> 10:17:35,140
Oh

12591
10:17:37,620 --> 10:17:40,020
Wait that video is still getting recommended to people

12592
10:17:41,380 --> 10:17:47,140
24,000 views 2,000 likes I wonder if because people are liking it

12593
10:17:48,580 --> 10:17:51,220
Strone has the best boing boing

12594
10:17:52,740 --> 10:17:56,020
Azura has biggest boing boing or do you mean rump?

12595
10:17:58,980 --> 10:18:00,980
I have the biggest rump

12596
10:18:02,500 --> 10:18:04,500
Oh

12597
10:18:05,060 --> 10:18:08,580
The perfect all the better to smother you basically

12598
10:18:09,780 --> 10:18:14,180
She's out pealard anything that ever happened the audio after this it takes a day

12599
10:18:14,820 --> 10:18:18,100
Do you think you'll feel accomplished when you get nighting in cooking? I hope so

12600
10:18:18,900 --> 10:18:21,540
I'm in the trenches right now on this swordfish

12601
10:18:24,900 --> 10:18:28,740
She accidentally played the clip on stream she forgot to turn off this the audio

12602
10:18:32,580 --> 10:18:34,580
Oh

12603
10:18:35,140 --> 10:18:39,060
You can pass away if you drink too much water she accidentally uploaded it to me

12604
10:18:42,500 --> 10:18:44,500
Uh, okay, okay, okay

12605
10:18:46,660 --> 10:18:48,820
She already has a warning on her channel

12606
10:18:50,260 --> 10:18:54,100
Amy playing with fire, but then again she is the pyromaniac of

12607
10:18:55,220 --> 10:18:57,860
Vila, so right um right on par

12608
10:18:59,140 --> 10:19:01,860
Can't believe it can't believe I found such a lore friendly girls

12609
10:19:02,420 --> 10:19:04,420
smile

12610
10:19:06,500 --> 10:19:09,700
I have to admit I'm think I'm starting to lag a bit

12611
10:19:10,740 --> 10:19:12,740
It's not looking good for me

12612
10:19:13,220 --> 10:19:15,220
slowly perishing

12613
10:19:15,220 --> 10:19:21,300
I'm like dad make a tea, but I don't think it's gonna wake me up, but I think it's gonna

12614
10:19:24,180 --> 10:19:27,620
Oh, my stomach's making freaking weird eyes noises. Can you hear that?

12615
10:19:33,220 --> 10:19:37,700
What will come first heat death of the universe or full inventory no burn honestly

12616
10:19:37,940 --> 10:19:44,500
I feel like I'm getting so close to it and then I'm getting although the burn percentage is 9.4 it used to be 18.9

12617
10:19:45,620 --> 10:19:51,620
She cut it out from the vod. We're safe question mark. I'm firmly of the opinion. There's such a thing as

12618
10:19:52,980 --> 10:19:54,580
Being too big

12619
10:19:54,580 --> 10:19:59,380
What's 99 after cooking? No, we're just doing cooking

12620
10:19:59,540 --> 10:20:04,020
We might do some questing together because I'm not familiar with a lot of quests

12621
10:20:04,740 --> 10:20:05,860
um

12622
10:20:05,860 --> 10:20:11,860
But that would just be very casual and probably level up combat a little bit before that and

12623
10:20:12,580 --> 10:20:15,060
once we've achieved 99 cooking and

12624
10:20:16,500 --> 10:20:19,140
I am not 99ing anything else. I

12625
10:20:20,340 --> 10:20:24,180
Have severely underestimated how much this is

12626
10:20:25,380 --> 10:20:27,380
and

12627
10:20:29,380 --> 10:20:31,780
A strong aspect fill to the caboose

12628
10:20:32,980 --> 10:20:37,060
If you ever do the cat quest you have to feed it when it's a kitten or it runs away

12629
10:20:38,020 --> 10:20:41,460
That's so specific. I'm probably never gonna retain this information

12630
10:20:44,180 --> 10:20:48,740
I'm going to go for a full 99 account for the first time off your brave

12631
10:20:50,340 --> 10:20:53,780
And the other version of runescape levels go up to 120

12632
10:20:54,900 --> 10:20:57,140
Did they take even longer to achieve?

12633
10:21:00,340 --> 10:21:05,940
Oh, that's crazy. Sorry. Oh, I'm having a wee yawn. Sorry

12634
10:21:11,140 --> 10:21:13,140
Don't mess that update on that video

12635
10:21:14,660 --> 10:21:22,820
Oh my god, I'm in the money list. I'm sorry. I really don't want to flicks on you guys, but we're in the money

12636
10:21:23,300 --> 10:21:25,300
Oh

12637
10:21:33,540 --> 10:21:40,020
Look, uh, whoa fill inventory. No burn get ready to ever said no burn

12638
10:21:43,060 --> 10:21:45,060
Hold on hold on hold on

12639
10:21:45,220 --> 10:21:48,020
So this is what it looked like a minute ago

12640
10:21:48,980 --> 10:21:53,140
So that was the last time I shared it with you 19.8. Okay

12641
10:21:54,100 --> 10:21:58,660
And the money didn't register, but now the money's registered. Are you ready to get flexed on?

12642
10:22:01,540 --> 10:22:03,540
Where is it?

12643
10:22:04,100 --> 10:22:08,820
Are you ready to get flexed on how much money I made on that video? Boom. That's right. Get flexed on

12644
10:22:10,740 --> 10:22:15,860
To say that gen two has been funded is an understatement. That's how much money I've made

12645
10:22:16,580 --> 10:22:18,580
What are you gonna do about them?

12646
10:22:21,700 --> 10:22:23,700
It got limited ads

12647
10:22:23,700 --> 10:22:27,540
So it probably would have been like 20 bucks if it wasn't limited ads

12648
10:22:28,020 --> 10:22:31,860
But you know what 10 bucks I'll take you you'll be logged out in 30 minutes

12649
10:22:31,860 --> 10:22:34,660
Make sure you move to a safe area or log out now

12650
10:22:35,620 --> 10:22:37,220
Your mama

12651
10:22:37,220 --> 10:22:41,620
Right. I I'm gonna go make a cup of tea then if it's gonna log me out so I can come back in

12652
10:22:42,340 --> 10:22:43,540
And

12653
10:22:43,540 --> 10:22:48,660
Getting 120 is getting 99 about eight times. Oh pass on that. No, thanks

12654
10:22:49,220 --> 10:22:54,180
How do people make a living off of youtube? Oh, it's much better than this when you have like a

12655
10:22:55,140 --> 10:23:00,900
A lot of ASMR videos to offer and you make like money generated in the background

12656
10:23:01,140 --> 10:23:05,540
Right, I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and let this game log me out. Um, I will be back

12657
10:23:05,620 --> 10:23:08,180
I would just take me about three minutes because you can't leave the world

12658
10:23:11,940 --> 10:23:14,740
They're in the runescapes. Uh, gay Brooks Johnny

12659
10:23:16,580 --> 10:23:17,940
Uh

12660
10:23:17,940 --> 10:23:19,380
Right, I'll be

12661
10:23:19,380 --> 10:23:26,420
Yeah, three minutes and I'll make a cup of tea. Please do stretch your legs and all that jazz. Um, I will be back

12662
10:23:27,300 --> 10:23:32,020
In three minutes, which I've said for the eighth time now. Sorry. I'm losing it. Well, I'll be back

12663
10:23:41,620 --> 10:23:43,620
So

12664
10:24:11,620 --> 10:24:13,620
So

12665
10:24:41,620 --> 10:24:43,620
So

12666
10:25:11,620 --> 10:25:13,620
So

12667
10:25:41,620 --> 10:25:43,620
So

12668
10:26:11,620 --> 10:26:13,620
So

12669
10:26:41,620 --> 10:26:43,620
So

12670
10:27:11,620 --> 10:27:13,620
So

12671
10:27:41,620 --> 10:27:43,620
So

12672
10:28:11,620 --> 10:28:13,620
So

12673
10:28:41,620 --> 10:28:43,620
So

12674
10:29:11,620 --> 10:29:13,620
So

12675
10:29:31,860 --> 10:29:36,500
Oh, it's actually quite a lot louder than in-game audio. Sorry if that like completely destroyed your ears

12676
10:29:36,900 --> 10:29:38,900
Hope no one's sleeping through this

12677
10:29:39,460 --> 10:29:42,660
Her account is gone too. Wait, who's the count? Look at that

12678
10:29:46,180 --> 10:29:48,180
Um

12679
10:29:48,260 --> 10:29:50,260
What was I doing

12680
10:29:50,260 --> 10:29:52,260
Fish fish fish

12681
10:29:52,500 --> 10:29:57,860
Um, I I'm starting to pass out. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting very tired. I'm a throats very sore

12682
10:29:59,860 --> 10:30:02,180
Which is why I need refilling tea

12683
10:30:03,220 --> 10:30:05,220
Not just any kind of honey tea

12684
10:30:06,180 --> 10:30:13,140
Well, I'll get a timer in five minutes. The music was pretty loud. Okay, my apologies. Oh, I've got honey on my freaking finger as well

12685
10:30:14,740 --> 10:30:17,700
I'm not the good I'm not my refilling honey. I need a special refill

12686
10:30:18,340 --> 10:30:20,660
The menu music apparently a separate set. Yeah

12687
10:30:22,660 --> 10:30:24,660
Monkey badness

12688
10:30:27,060 --> 10:30:30,900
Nice sleepy little reeflings who were already snoozed together honestly

12689
10:30:31,700 --> 10:30:34,900
Oh, I'm I'm getting tired myself

12690
10:30:44,820 --> 10:30:49,940
Oh gee Hermes, thank you for becoming a member as a reminder

12691
10:30:51,220 --> 10:30:53,220
All membership streams

12692
10:30:53,860 --> 10:30:54,900
No

12693
10:30:54,900 --> 10:30:58,660
Next week membership streams start because I've already locked in what happens this week

12694
10:30:59,460 --> 10:31:01,460
Next week is very busy

12695
10:31:02,580 --> 10:31:04,580
as next week when

12696
10:31:06,100 --> 10:31:06,980
Uh

12697
10:31:06,980 --> 10:31:08,740
Elden Ring comes out

12698
10:31:08,740 --> 10:31:12,260
It's today next week Elden Ring DLC comes out. Okay, so

12699
10:31:13,300 --> 10:31:15,380
The start of the week is going to be like a

12700
10:31:16,340 --> 10:31:20,900
multitude of different things going on. It's a little bit crazy sometimes

12701
10:31:21,860 --> 10:31:28,340
Refilling tea you mean ink tea exactly. That's what my refilling tea is

12702
10:31:29,780 --> 10:31:31,780
Passed it four times, but I got the tea

12703
10:31:34,020 --> 10:31:40,580
A bit oh my god, I love those stories where it's like my legs are quaking after a good session. I'm like, oh my god

12704
10:31:41,540 --> 10:31:44,660
Oh, no, that's not it is I can't feel my legs after

12705
10:31:45,460 --> 10:31:49,380
How hard I was beating in that session those ones always make me crack up

12706
10:31:50,900 --> 10:31:52,900
What's good

12707
10:31:55,060 --> 10:31:56,660
Uh

12708
10:31:56,660 --> 10:32:02,740
What's good, uh, we're going 10 and a half hour strong. We're wrapping up an hour

12709
10:32:03,780 --> 10:32:11,140
In less than 30 because of the void restriction. Um, I am going to see if mercy is available

12710
10:32:11,940 --> 10:32:13,940
to read into or a zero

12711
10:32:14,820 --> 10:32:16,820
um

12712
10:32:17,060 --> 10:32:21,700
Oh, my tummy keeps making noises because I need uh, did I end up going for a job?

12713
10:32:22,340 --> 10:32:27,620
No, it wasn't successful. I had an unsuccessful attempt at adobe, which is why my stomach's making

12714
10:32:28,420 --> 10:32:34,340
Uh, bizarre noises right now. Oh my god. I'm starting to get like full cooked sword run swordfish ones, which is amazing

12715
10:32:34,980 --> 10:32:38,260
Do your reeflings want your money back? Am I undet to beeflings?

12716
10:32:38,820 --> 10:32:42,900
Oh, no, is there any runescape reeflings that I'm indebted to?

12717
10:32:43,620 --> 10:32:50,900
But I don't have any money. How will I ever repay you runescape reefling for all the things you've done?

12718
10:32:55,220 --> 10:32:57,620
Get wrecked and connect for apparently

12719
10:33:00,020 --> 10:33:03,060
Left for a bit and you're still going. Oh, I'm a tough cookie

12720
10:33:03,860 --> 10:33:05,860
Hard hard to get me to crack

12721
10:33:06,340 --> 10:33:10,180
When I say, uh, I need to make up for lost time. I wasn't kidding

12722
10:33:11,140 --> 10:33:15,220
I wasn't kidding. Uh, literally next week we've got like four, maybe even five

12723
10:33:17,700 --> 10:33:23,060
Well, please don't be getting sick. I really don't want to get sick. Oh, I'm not gonna make it if I get sick

12724
10:33:23,780 --> 10:33:26,260
I'm not gonna make it. I really don't want to get sick

12725
10:33:30,980 --> 10:33:36,980
Bless you. Thank you. He's on high. I accept ASMR's payment. Oh, yeah

12726
10:33:36,980 --> 10:33:38,980
Yeah

12727
10:33:39,860 --> 10:33:41,860
Per little

12728
10:33:42,500 --> 10:33:44,500
Needing some tingles

12729
10:33:51,060 --> 10:33:54,100
One hour of agility treatment is payment because I can't be bothered

12730
10:33:56,500 --> 10:34:02,660
I need to maybe get the agility shortcut wherever it is on the map. It's like 21 to do the grand exchange shortcut

12731
10:34:07,060 --> 10:34:09,060
We formally request snitches

12732
10:34:10,660 --> 10:34:14,020
Thank you for being my sugar daddy on runescape

12733
10:34:16,100 --> 10:34:20,820
Thank you for making it super easy real me versus strony connect for

12734
10:34:22,900 --> 10:34:24,900
The real

12735
10:34:26,340 --> 10:34:32,100
Strony milkers warm and tasty strony milkies, please be hey stay. Oh my god, that's such a good

12736
10:34:32,820 --> 10:34:38,100
Uh, there's a connect for minigame and runescape. There absolutely is. Do you want to know how I know?

12737
10:34:38,100 --> 10:34:44,420
There's a connect for minigame and runescape. Uh, I got absolutely annihilated by all the reeflings unanimously at once

12738
10:34:45,140 --> 10:34:51,620
Uh, the only reason I think I won I won one game by tryharding and I won a second game by mistake

12739
10:34:52,020 --> 10:34:54,260
Because the other reefling wasn't paying attention

12740
10:34:56,580 --> 10:35:01,380
And I was literally eating a burrito and I was like what the fuck with my mouth full of a burrito

12741
10:35:02,100 --> 10:35:04,100
I

12742
10:35:05,700 --> 10:35:09,060
If you're going to do agility, there's a quest so you can skip a lot of it

12743
10:35:09,860 --> 10:35:11,860
I think when we do 99

12744
10:35:12,420 --> 10:35:19,140
Cookin will probably take a solid break from any runescape streams for a bit because there are a few other like multiplayer games

12745
10:35:19,140 --> 10:35:22,340
I want to like focus on like elden rings like the next big

12746
10:35:23,140 --> 10:35:25,140
Like a thing we're taking on

12747
10:35:25,700 --> 10:35:27,700
and

12748
10:35:28,260 --> 10:35:30,260
I don't know if you can hear my stomach

12749
10:35:32,260 --> 10:35:35,300
No, you can't the mic's not covered. It's covering it up

12750
10:35:36,660 --> 10:35:42,100
Just Johnny's milk tastes like jelly. I even know what cuttlefish milk would taste like

12751
10:35:44,100 --> 10:35:47,380
Would it be gelatinous or would it be silky like ink?

12752
10:35:49,460 --> 10:35:51,460
I think it may be silky

12753
10:35:53,300 --> 10:35:55,300
Worthing

12754
10:35:55,300 --> 10:35:57,220
Love these 20 things

12755
10:35:57,220 --> 10:35:59,220
Thank you for the smoothies

12756
10:35:59,220 --> 10:36:01,220
Also need to be on a members world for uh

12757
10:36:02,340 --> 10:36:07,780
I'm blamed when it comes to board games. I lost fair and square though. Okay. Okay. Okay

12758
10:36:09,860 --> 10:36:15,620
Well, actually who's got the higher IQ reeflings are strong in clearly the reef one clearly

12759
10:36:23,540 --> 10:36:24,580
Wow

12760
10:36:24,580 --> 10:36:28,740
We're at 1.4 on the swordfish. We may be able to finish it

12761
10:36:29,220 --> 10:36:30,340
Or

12762
10:36:30,340 --> 10:36:33,860
We might just be out of time, but honestly, it's not the biggest deal. However

12763
10:36:34,900 --> 10:36:38,260
You need to give strongy the monkey nut items. That's so specific

12764
10:36:39,540 --> 10:36:41,540
and

12765
10:36:41,700 --> 10:36:46,260
And could we solely if it's anything like squid ink you've eaten squid ink before

12766
10:36:48,420 --> 10:36:54,740
You've eaten your fellow reeflings before oh, we're in 1.6 k territory at 1,600

12767
10:36:55,380 --> 10:36:59,540
Monkey nuts 287. I blame all my eyes. I

12768
10:37:03,220 --> 10:37:06,020
I'm on you you eating your fellow reeflings. What's going on here?

12769
10:37:06,020 --> 10:37:08,020
Oh

12770
10:37:22,340 --> 10:37:23,620
See to be honest

12771
10:37:23,620 --> 10:37:26,740
You were just randomly placing the pieces, but I wasn't low

12772
10:37:26,900 --> 10:37:31,380
I was trying to counteract what the reefling was doing. That's the worst part

12773
10:37:31,540 --> 10:37:36,340
I was actually trying to win and I could never see what the reefling was making

12774
10:37:36,660 --> 10:37:43,060
I was too busy trying to like get ahead and make something for me that I couldn't see what the reefling was doing

12775
10:37:46,580 --> 10:37:54,500
Is worse than emmy rip of my jeans what I listen to emmy stream and if I recall correctly my glass prescription is worse than emmy

12776
10:37:55,060 --> 10:37:59,700
Oh, emmy cannot see. Oh my goodness bless her cotton socks. She can't see for

12777
10:38:02,340 --> 10:38:05,780
I reeflings gotta do what he got a scuba doo ba doo

12778
10:38:08,020 --> 10:38:13,460
Yeah, you literally saw what I was doing and then you forgot no because I was trying to like

12779
10:38:14,180 --> 10:38:17,780
I was trying to be like all the reeflings doing this the reeflings doing that right

12780
10:38:17,780 --> 10:38:20,660
So I'm not gonna place one here and then I'd immediately forget

12781
10:38:24,020 --> 10:38:26,020
Mods cruises jays

12782
10:38:27,460 --> 10:38:29,460
You really want me to believe that yeah

12783
10:38:30,420 --> 10:38:32,420
I was like trying to think ahead

12784
10:38:40,020 --> 10:38:44,580
I believe I can't believe I made it 10 us dollars. It feels good man

12785
10:38:51,540 --> 10:38:53,540
Wow

12786
10:38:54,100 --> 10:38:56,340
Okay, these swordfish are giving me like

12787
10:38:56,580 --> 10:38:57,860
What

12788
10:38:57,860 --> 10:39:00,820
7k a batch that's not bad

12789
10:39:02,340 --> 10:39:06,260
Honestly not bad. I know wine is more which is fine

12790
10:39:06,900 --> 10:39:12,020
But I think that's like 7k xp of inventory if I don't burn them all. Okay. Okay

12791
10:39:13,620 --> 10:39:15,620
Well spoke too soon on that one

12792
10:39:19,060 --> 10:39:20,900
Congrats on level up

12793
10:39:20,980 --> 10:39:26,900
It's time to beat on up on connect for strategy. It's like I'm beat strong the next time

12794
10:39:34,500 --> 10:39:39,940
What's my burn percentage? Oh, it's like oh, I guess it's not up to accuracy because I logged out

12795
10:39:41,060 --> 10:39:44,260
I got logged out against me will yeah, um

12796
10:39:45,220 --> 10:39:51,700
Right tomorrow's crash bandicoot, which is eight hours. So it's just a long stream in quotation marks

12797
10:39:52,820 --> 10:39:54,820
Not an endurance

12798
10:39:55,060 --> 10:40:00,260
Short stream is two hours. Um, which is buckshot roulette, but that's because I've got the doctor

12799
10:40:03,300 --> 10:40:07,460
And I'll keep you guys up to date on what on earth is happening with me toe

12800
10:40:07,540 --> 10:40:11,540
But it's pretty much decided if you guys want to hold a funeral during buckshot roulette

12801
10:40:12,020 --> 10:40:14,980
You're more than welcome to pour one out for the toe

12802
10:40:16,100 --> 10:40:18,100
It's been a good run, but

12803
10:40:18,420 --> 10:40:21,380
I'm just no fussed for it. Does they make a difference to me?

12804
10:40:22,420 --> 10:40:24,420
To me

12805
10:40:24,980 --> 10:40:26,980
To me

12806
10:40:28,820 --> 10:40:30,580
Riptoe

12807
10:40:30,580 --> 10:40:37,140
It's a great lineup. Yeah, I do. Um, I want or probably can't do it tonight because I'm going to be shattered

12808
10:40:37,540 --> 10:40:42,660
I need to go put emmy and aces memberships live literally as soon as I end this stream

12809
10:40:44,100 --> 10:40:46,100
So I need to

12810
10:40:46,500 --> 10:40:48,500
What I need to do

12811
10:40:50,260 --> 10:40:52,260
I need to

12812
10:40:53,380 --> 10:40:55,380
Do that

12813
10:40:55,860 --> 10:41:00,580
I wanted to look up baltro more because that actually looks like a genuinely fun game

12814
10:41:01,140 --> 10:41:04,020
I just need to comprehend what on earth i'm doing first

12815
10:41:04,580 --> 10:41:09,940
I don't know. Maybe I need to play it offline like off stream for a little bit just to get the hang of it

12816
10:41:11,220 --> 10:41:14,340
Or is it better if streamer plays it for the first time?

12817
10:41:15,380 --> 10:41:18,100
Like I don't think watching other people play it is cheating

12818
10:41:19,700 --> 10:41:23,940
Rip the big gripper you will be missed literally both of them. No, no, just the one

12819
10:41:25,460 --> 10:41:27,780
Shawnee caught the da budus. Oh, no

12820
10:41:28,420 --> 10:41:30,420
People don't think I've got da budus

12821
10:41:31,380 --> 10:41:38,580
Um, oh my god a streamer tries american sweet loses toenails loses toenail within

12822
10:41:39,460 --> 10:41:41,220
one week

12823
10:41:41,220 --> 10:41:43,220
Diabetes hits hard on streamer

12824
10:41:47,060 --> 10:41:51,060
How many features do you see how many where we get no burns one?

12825
10:41:52,580 --> 10:41:54,580
Honestly

12826
10:41:54,820 --> 10:41:59,620
How many multiplayer games are on your to-do list multiplayer games are every week

12827
10:42:00,820 --> 10:42:05,380
um next multiplayer game is elden ring for a while and then

12828
10:42:07,140 --> 10:42:09,140
Probably jellybean

12829
10:42:10,580 --> 10:42:17,460
I love my jellybean. I don't know if they've added more stuff to it. Um, we never gave dead by daylight ago

12830
10:42:17,540 --> 10:42:19,540
I don't know how that would work

12831
10:42:20,340 --> 10:42:26,260
I think I would have to add you guys as friends possibly on steam and then delete everyone at the end

12832
10:42:26,580 --> 10:42:32,500
I don't know. I wanted to give fortnite a shot, but folk were rolling their eyes at fortnite

12833
10:42:32,500 --> 10:42:34,980
But i'm like fortnite's actually know that bad

12834
10:42:35,780 --> 10:42:39,940
As far as i'm aware they've like added in different game modes and stuff

12835
10:42:41,060 --> 10:42:43,060
um

12836
10:42:45,220 --> 10:42:49,620
I want uh, I would say mario kart but I suck at mario kart and it and

12837
10:42:50,740 --> 10:42:54,180
Like I don't I don't know how to do that new turn feature thing in it

12838
10:42:54,260 --> 10:42:56,340
Like we have to like turn left and right well

12839
10:42:58,500 --> 10:43:01,000
Called it momay win the jellybean game

12840
10:43:04,180 --> 10:43:06,920
It's a meme to hate fortnite at this point

12841
10:43:18,100 --> 10:43:19,780
It's just

12842
10:43:19,780 --> 10:43:22,340
Ever listened to rap city you want to sing it

12843
10:43:23,300 --> 10:43:25,780
Is this the real life?

12844
10:43:27,140 --> 10:43:29,700
Or is this just fantasy?

12845
10:43:31,540 --> 10:43:33,540
Caught in a landslide

12846
10:43:35,380 --> 10:43:38,580
No escape from reality

12847
10:43:41,460 --> 10:43:45,300
Look in your eyes, I don't know the words and see

12848
10:43:48,100 --> 10:43:50,100
uh

12849
10:43:50,100 --> 10:44:02,100
So you think you can stop me and make me cry

12850
10:44:04,580 --> 10:44:08,420
So you think i'm just gonna lay down and die

12851
10:44:10,740 --> 10:44:12,740
Oh baby

12852
10:44:14,100 --> 10:44:18,420
Just can't wait to go just can't wait to go here

12853
10:44:19,060 --> 10:44:20,580
Is that the word?

12854
10:44:20,580 --> 10:44:22,580
I don't know. I don't know

12855
10:44:23,940 --> 10:44:25,860
um

12856
10:44:25,860 --> 10:44:27,860
I was thinking about the in-game song oops

12857
10:44:28,580 --> 10:44:30,580
in my bed

12858
10:44:30,900 --> 10:44:32,900
What is, where does that go?

12859
10:44:33,860 --> 10:44:37,060
Easy come easy go little high little woe

12860
10:44:39,060 --> 10:44:42,980
Anyway the wind blows it doesn't matter to me

12861
10:44:43,220 --> 10:44:45,220
Hmm

12862
10:44:45,540 --> 10:44:49,620
I'm just a poor boy from a poor family. He's just a poor boy

12863
10:44:50,660 --> 10:44:53,060
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

12864
10:44:54,900 --> 10:44:56,900
Uh, how else does it go?

12865
10:45:02,500 --> 10:45:04,500
No, no, no, no, let him go

12866
10:45:07,700 --> 10:45:10,420
I can't remember how that freaking goes

12867
10:45:13,780 --> 10:45:15,780
Watch and lock it so you can listen to it

12868
10:45:16,500 --> 10:45:23,540
No, I finished these freaking swordfish before I fall asleep. I'm like so tired my eyes are bulging out of their skull right now

12869
10:45:25,300 --> 10:45:29,940
I'm ready to snooze although I might level up actually before I snooze

12870
10:45:30,580 --> 10:45:34,820
Best cover let me go. We will not let you go. No, no, no, no, no

12871
10:45:35,780 --> 10:45:37,780
No, it's important

12872
10:45:38,500 --> 10:45:45,140
Best cover. Oh, yeah, did you enjoy that me guess and all the lyrics was that entire thing because I completely forgot how it works

12873
10:45:46,420 --> 10:45:48,420
That's the whole level

12874
10:45:48,900 --> 10:45:52,340
Wow, we're gonna be 78 by the end of this feels good, man

12875
10:45:53,460 --> 10:45:55,460
Feel good, man

12876
10:46:00,580 --> 10:46:04,900
Oh, excuse me for yawning. I'm so going to bed. Oh my god

12877
10:46:07,780 --> 10:46:09,780
I

12878
10:46:16,900 --> 10:46:19,940
I'm just a perv. We fun. I need no sympathy

12879
10:46:25,300 --> 10:46:27,300
That wasn't I'm just a fool

12880
10:46:29,060 --> 10:46:31,060
Because I have a mummy I'm

12881
10:46:31,140 --> 10:46:34,740
Mummies losing the plot. That's what mummy's doing right now. I'm starting to

12882
10:46:35,460 --> 10:46:39,140
Uh, yeah, but h2o delirious often here

12883
10:46:40,580 --> 10:46:45,460
The bird outside my window the magpies are probably wondering why I have upset them today

12884
10:46:46,580 --> 10:46:48,580
and

12885
10:46:49,860 --> 10:46:51,860
I can do it. I promise

12886
10:46:52,740 --> 10:46:57,060
I can do it. I can stay up reefing. I'm totally not exhausted, but it's okay

12887
10:47:00,740 --> 10:47:02,740
I can make it happen

12888
10:47:02,820 --> 10:47:04,820
I can make it happen

12889
10:47:10,100 --> 10:47:12,100
Yay

12890
10:47:12,180 --> 10:47:17,060
I didn't get any serotonin, but I think it's because I'm so tired. There's no serotonin left in my system

12891
10:47:17,540 --> 10:47:19,860
You don't have anything to burn on the fire. I do so

12892
10:47:20,580 --> 10:47:22,580
level 78

12893
10:47:22,580 --> 10:47:24,580
let's go

12894
10:47:24,900 --> 10:47:26,900
level 78

12895
10:47:26,900 --> 10:47:28,900
Well, now I gotta adapt the learn

12896
10:47:29,700 --> 10:47:34,820
Yeah, eventually serotonin only comes from night in it man. This game was rigged from the start

12897
10:47:36,020 --> 10:47:38,020
Reach for the stars

12898
10:47:40,020 --> 10:47:45,220
Yippee 78. Well, I definitely blew over my guesstimate for what we would be on

12899
10:47:46,420 --> 10:47:50,100
But uh, I'm still back at level 62

12900
10:47:51,540 --> 10:47:57,140
That's fine. Maybe wane cost a lot of money though. That's the only problem

12901
10:47:59,780 --> 10:48:01,780
Oh

12902
10:48:03,300 --> 10:48:07,780
Are we friends? I can do it. I can do it. You kid

12903
10:48:09,540 --> 10:48:12,900
I could also cook and not waste xp. She's passing out. Oh, yeah

12904
10:48:14,580 --> 10:48:18,740
Oh my god, I'm actually like this this sleep is really starting to hit me

12905
10:48:19,380 --> 10:48:22,180
I don't even have my tea yet. Can you hear it? Can you tell them?

12906
10:48:23,140 --> 10:48:28,900
Wow kfp with another 10. Thank you. My goodness

12907
10:48:30,580 --> 10:48:34,420
Are you squidding me right now? Are you squidding me man?

12908
10:48:36,180 --> 10:48:39,220
Congrats to those who caught the membership with their face

10:48:43,300 --> 10:48:46,740
swordfish. I'm getting so disheartened. I have my copper tea in my hand right now

12911
10:48:47,860 --> 10:48:50,500
I should probably go to sleep. I'm freaking ready to go

12912
10:48:52,180 --> 10:48:54,180
I'm tired

12913
10:48:54,180 --> 10:48:56,500
Strani sounds like she only has one hp left. No

12914
10:48:58,180 --> 10:49:02,020
Wait, I'll just I'll read some really naughty marshmallows. That should wake me up

12915
10:49:03,300 --> 10:49:05,300
Come on ovulation

12916
10:49:05,540 --> 10:49:08,740
Keep me awake so we can oh actually

12918
10:49:14,260 --> 10:49:16,740
Mercy is still streaming for another hour

12919
10:49:17,060 --> 10:49:21,620
Just say like strani wants to read into you, but she doesn't know if you're playing for another hour or not

12920
10:49:22,980 --> 10:49:24,980
Um

12921
10:49:25,380 --> 10:49:29,940
If there's any wee snippets that want to be a deer and pass on a message from mummy

12922
10:49:34,580 --> 10:49:36,580
A big bug

12923
10:49:37,540 --> 10:49:43,940
Zero gates zero grapes in vorkuto. Oh wait. Sorry. That's the the bolt from bluffops

12924
10:49:44,740 --> 10:49:46,740
Didn't make it sad

12925
10:49:46,900 --> 10:49:51,860
What's your take on leveling up without only to your little oh, no you can level up all you want

12926
10:49:51,940 --> 10:49:56,820
It's perfectly fine too. I'm not gonna let for me personally. I'm not gonna level up offline

12927
10:49:57,060 --> 10:50:03,220

I'm ready to pass out. Oh my god. My bed time's normally five o'clock. I've got

12940
10:51:05,220 --> 10:51:08,020
Two more hours until bedtime and I'm perishing

12941
10:51:09,140 --> 10:51:12,740
I don't want to end early though. The whole point is supposed to be like endurance

12942
10:51:13,060 --> 10:51:16,580
But oh my god, this is like whacking me for the sight of my heat

12943
10:51:20,340 --> 10:51:22,740
Normally I don't do

12944
10:51:25,460 --> 10:51:27,800
Oh my god brain, please cooperate

12945
10:51:30,340 --> 10:51:32,340
My brain's not cooperating. Holy crap

12946
10:51:34,660 --> 10:51:36,660
Sleepy momy

12952
10:52:00,820 --> 10:52:02,820
Ah

12953
10:52:02,980 --> 10:52:08,340
Strani, what's your feelings about uh, you start sleeping the same way your girlfriend has happened to?

12954
10:52:09,540 --> 10:52:13,300
See on me. No me doing that to you. Absolutely

12955
10:52:15,700 --> 10:52:18,660
I will discuss more of that in the member stream. Maybe

12956
10:52:20,740 --> 10:52:22,740
Hold the lane

12957
10:52:23,060 --> 10:52:25,060
Hold the lane. I'm holding

10:52:36,340 --> 10:52:40,260
I was supposed to eat that food and it was supposed to freaking help me

10:52:41,620 --> 10:52:45,940
Get more energized and I just want to roll up into a ball and pass out

12963
10:52:46,660 --> 10:52:51,460
I'm like sipping honey tea. It's got caffeine in it. It's gonna do absolutely nothing for me

12964
10:52:52,420 --> 10:52:57,380
A sugar crash. Did I eat with that take away have sugar in it?

12965

You can sleep early

12966

But me doing it to you

And it should have picked mercy

12990
10:55:15,220 --> 10:55:17,620
Should have picked any kind of

12991
10:55:21,620 --> 10:55:23,620
I'm sorry for seeing it out loud

12992
10:55:24,260 --> 10:55:26,260
Mommy's getting tired

She makes a lot of random base references should have gone to Scotland spend a week

12996
10:55:45,780 --> 10:55:48,980
In your 20s are you an OG son?

12997
10:55:53,700 --> 10:55:57,060
There he makes you an OG son surely surely

12998
10:56:02,420 --> 10:56:04,900
You should stream more when you're both tired and I'll be like

12999
10:56:06,340 --> 10:56:11,060
Shiny, I don't know if you know I don't remember that till day they do it. Who does it?

13000
10:56:13,300 --> 10:56:15,300
The day who does what?

13001
10:56:17,220 --> 10:56:19,220
What does that mean? What is that?

13002

But the game ends up going offline. Oh like the game updates for patches. Yeah, there he hikes that 31

It's all in board your tears or what I live for

13006
10:56:45,140 --> 10:56:47,940
Because you should have picked mercy

13007
10:56:51,220 --> 10:56:54,900
Should have picked any kind of girl of your

13008
10:56:55,620 --> 10:57:03,060
Yeah, my tummy. I don't know if you can hear those internal parts, but if you can hear the internal parts, I'm sorry

13009
10:57:03,060 --> 10:57:05,060
I had to be this way

13010
10:57:08,020 --> 10:57:12,900
Didn't I see this stream this morning 10 hours. Yeah. Yeah, you did. I'm a wee bit addicted

13011
10:57:13,380 --> 10:57:15,380
I'm starting to lose the plot though. So

13012
10:57:16,420 --> 10:57:19,140
You're welcome to watch my descent into madness

13013
10:57:19,620 --> 10:57:24,180
My filter is also gone because I've started to see things. I know I'm not supposed to see

13014
10:57:24,740 --> 10:57:27,300
But they're kind of just coming out just like you're angry, you know

13015
10:57:29,540 --> 10:57:33,380
Only so much I can do we're actually gonna get less than a thousand sorties

13016
10:57:34,980 --> 10:57:39,300
Listen, I mean that internal part. No, they are internal parts. Well, at least I'm a digest

13017
10:57:41,700 --> 10:57:43,700
But this must mean I'm disgusting

13018
10:57:43,700 --> 10:57:45,700
I

13019
10:57:46,580 --> 10:57:50,100
To make myself wealthy she's slowly dying from my

13020
10:57:54,660 --> 10:57:56,260
Oh

13021
10:57:56,260 --> 10:58:02,020
I came in at work quite tired and feisty wrote an entire world domination agenda on my calendar

13022
10:58:02,900 --> 10:58:05,940
Are we doing it? Are we taking down the big companies?

13023
10:58:07,540 --> 10:58:10,580
11 hour grinds that interests of thoughts are taking the wheel

13024
10:58:11,300 --> 10:58:13,300
Take the wheel

13025
10:58:16,420 --> 10:58:17,460
Man really?

13026
10:58:17,460 --> 10:58:21,620
Okay. Oh, I had to complete the start for that. Man runescape is really

13027
10:58:22,340 --> 10:58:27,540
Oh gee. Yes old-school runescape runescape 3 which is the new one. I think

13028
10:58:28,580 --> 10:58:32,500
Not really played that at all. I didn't actually understand

13029
10:58:33,700 --> 10:58:35,940
When it came out there was two different games

13030
10:58:36,340 --> 10:58:40,340
And I think I actually ended up playing runescape 3 for a little bit like a dummy

13031
10:58:40,820 --> 10:58:44,020
Because I was like, why is the game so different? Why did they do that?

13032
10:58:44,420 --> 10:58:46,020
and then

13033
10:58:46,020 --> 10:58:51,300
Or was it they made runescape 3 and then everyone was like oh go back and then they're like, okay

13034
10:58:51,540 --> 10:58:53,540
There's no two games

13035
10:58:55,140 --> 10:59:00,020
These are the golden hours. So this is the last batch. Uh, not quite. We've still got

13036
10:59:03,460 --> 10:59:06,900
50 minutes, I could have sworn it said 50 minutes 50 minutes ago, but

13037
10:59:07,860 --> 10:59:13,220
There's three. I thought there was like runescape 3 wasn't the new runescape called runescape 3

13038
10:59:14,420 --> 10:59:16,420
It's really ojisa

13039
10:59:17,540 --> 10:59:19,540
Get it because that's how I say ojii

13040
10:59:21,140 --> 10:59:25,300
Runescape 3 is the original server from that. It's mostly runescape is them

13041
10:59:25,780 --> 10:59:28,980
We've written the old game back. Oh, okay

13042
10:59:30,260 --> 10:59:36,420
Because they didn't world of warcraft do that as well. There's like an old world warcraft. Oh my god

13043
10:59:37,620 --> 10:59:41,220
My tongue is not even following what I'm telling it to do

13044
10:59:42,260 --> 10:59:44,260
Wow

13045
10:59:47,060 --> 10:59:49,700
You said three batches before this is what? No

13046
10:59:52,660 --> 10:59:54,180
Hmm

13047
10:59:54,180 --> 10:59:58,500
Oh almost just knocked over my cola everywhere. Gee willivers. I really should clean this

13048
10:59:59,460 --> 11:00:04,980
Oh, what happens if I feel not stop opening up the collection and stop eating the swordfish

13049
11:00:05,060 --> 11:00:07,060
We're gonna sell that we need that money

13050
11:00:07,700 --> 11:00:09,700
Okay, right 900 now

13051
11:00:10,740 --> 11:00:12,740

11:00:26,900 --> 11:00:28,260

13057
11:00:28,260 --> 11:00:30,260
for every hundred

13058
11:00:31,620 --> 11:00:33,620
Oh

13059
11:00:34,340 --> 11:00:36,340
Refling on time

13060
11:00:42,500 --> 11:00:50,340
Play both just where what did you see just play both it's not like this game is grinding or anything

13061
11:00:51,140 --> 11:00:56,420
Are you gonna disappoint us or not? I said I'm disappointed. I'm freaking doing it. I'm freaking

13062
11:00:57,380 --> 11:00:59,380

Swordfish I'm cooking my ancestors and my cousins and stuff because get it because I'm a cult

13064
11:01:10,740 --> 11:01:14,340

13065
11:01:15,460 --> 11:01:17,460

13066
11:01:18,580 --> 11:01:20,580
Are you

13067
11:01:21,620 --> 11:01:25,620
I think I'm losing the ability to read right now. I don't think you said that

13068
11:01:26,500 --> 11:01:28,500
Holy crap

13069
11:01:28,900 --> 11:01:33,300
As you're refling you're requesting me to go but okay, that looks more like english

13070
11:01:34,420 --> 11:01:36,420
Go to sleep. No you go to sleep

13071
11:01:37,380 --> 11:01:39,380
Go to sleep when

13072
11:01:40,980 --> 11:01:42,980
When something happens

13073
11:01:47,620 --> 11:01:55,140
Go I'm gonna I can do endurance stream. Literally. I don't want to lose my endurance title like two centimeters in of like playing the game

13074
11:01:56,500 --> 11:01:58,340
Wow

13075
11:01:58,900 --> 11:02:00,900
I'll only go to sleep if you come with me

13076
11:02:01,780 --> 11:02:05,940
Come with me. Oh, no, it's wrong one. It's that Japanese song

13077
11:02:06,980 --> 11:02:08,980
Stay with me

13078
11:02:17,140 --> 11:02:19,140
Don't have the rest of my clothes

13079
11:02:22,180 --> 11:02:24,180
I'll only sleep if you just

13080
11:02:24,820 --> 11:02:26,660
Yeah

13081
11:02:26,660 --> 11:02:30,740
Self hypnosis by exhaustion. This is working apparently. No

13082
11:02:33,300 --> 11:02:38,020
You've been streaming for 11 hours nobody's taking your endurance from your title from you

13083
11:02:42,180 --> 11:02:49,140
I'm just gonna eat this little cheeky little bit cheeky swordfish on a Sunday afternoon. I don't even know what day of the week is

13084
11:02:50,020 --> 11:02:52,420
You know what day of the week is stream day

13085
11:02:53,380 --> 11:02:55,380
I like it the beam all my way

13086
11:03:01,140 --> 11:03:03,140
Imagine if I could see me

13087
11:03:06,900 --> 11:03:08,900
Remember that time I got hired to sing

13088
11:03:10,980 --> 11:03:13,620
Right stop it. That's naughty

13089
11:03:14,660 --> 11:03:18,660
That's naughty. Okay. We're almost finished with the swordfish

13090
11:03:22,420 --> 11:03:27,060
You're beginning to feel very very sleepy

13091
11:03:27,700 --> 11:03:31,540
By your talking like a vampire

13092
11:03:36,420 --> 11:03:38,420
Stay with me

13093
11:03:47,540 --> 11:03:50,420
What are they even talking about honestly I feel like I'm eavesdropping

13094
11:03:52,500 --> 11:03:57,780
I wait for their new message to pop up and I'll start commentating on what the reef ones are talking about to each other

13095
11:03:59,060 --> 11:04:01,060
They'll never they'll never expect

13096
11:04:01,620 --> 11:04:04,020
Oh for goodness sake. I don't know how I keep doing that

13097
11:04:06,420 --> 11:04:07,460
Wow

13098
11:04:07,460 --> 11:04:11,300
Boom boom look at that nine third cheek. No

13099
11:04:14,660 --> 11:04:18,100
She collected again. Well, I'm not allowed to collect

13100
11:04:18,820 --> 11:04:25,780
It's because I'm a whammin my mistakes is I'm even in runescape. I'm sorry. That's not nice

13101
11:04:25,860 --> 11:04:30,500
You know, you just play the whammin card whenever you want. That's kind of funny though

13102
11:04:39,220 --> 11:04:43,460
I don't know why you're right-clicking it. I don't know. Maybe maybe I'll right-click you ring

13103
11:04:44,260 --> 11:04:46,260
Right click is funny

13104
11:04:48,820 --> 11:04:50,820
You collect here

13105
11:04:52,660 --> 11:04:54,660
Look into the mirror, you know

13106
11:04:56,020 --> 11:04:58,020
We're talking about time-spanning games

13107
11:04:58,980 --> 11:05:02,980
Is your rune crafting world still up? I remember the little rune crafting

13108
11:05:03,620 --> 11:05:05,620
I don't know what that means

13109
11:05:05,620 --> 11:05:08,820
But thank you for your question. The answer is probably no. Smile

13110
11:05:10,340 --> 11:05:12,340
I don't know anything about runescape

13111
11:05:12,980 --> 11:05:15,860
Good night throny and everyone. I'm gonna see

13112
11:05:16,820 --> 11:05:18,820
Rest well

13113
11:05:39,780 --> 11:05:43,940
I swear if anyone puts anything under 18 to that question your album

13114
11:05:46,580 --> 11:05:49,540
I'm gonna do it

13115
11:05:50,980 --> 11:05:57,300
Okay, we've got 45 minutes or something like that. Oh no, now we've got 50. No, we've got less than 50 minutes

13116
11:05:58,100 --> 11:06:01,060
We've got 49 minutes because the board breaks all of them

13117
11:06:01,460 --> 11:06:03,460
Wow

13118
11:06:12,980 --> 11:06:16,020
Should I write the girl's mirrors as a prank?

13119
11:06:17,380 --> 11:06:19,380
We could do that

13120
11:06:19,700 --> 11:06:22,740
You pretend to not be me and write the girl's mirrors

13121
11:06:24,100 --> 11:06:26,100
And say the most terrible stuff

13122
11:06:31,220 --> 11:06:38,580
Do it do extremely spicy one. Okay, who should we do for?

13123
11:06:40,020 --> 11:06:45,700
Mods, can I give you permission to speak so you give me the girl's links and I'll write some stuff and I'll wash my lips I shouldn't

13124
11:06:45,860 --> 11:06:47,860

13125
11:06:58,660 --> 11:07:05,620

But I am already blessed

13136
