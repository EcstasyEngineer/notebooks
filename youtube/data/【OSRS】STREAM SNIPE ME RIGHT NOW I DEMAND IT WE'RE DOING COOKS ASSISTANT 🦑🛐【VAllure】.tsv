0	7000	I'm sorry.
7000	12000	I'm sorry.
12000	18000	I'm sorry.
18000	21000	I'm sorry.
21000	26000	I'm sorry.
26000	28000	Bruh.
28000	31000	Everything is breaking right now.
31000	32000	Holy crap.
32000	37000	Everything has broken.
37000	39000	I can't even hear in-game sound.
39000	41000	I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be here in the music right now.
41000	43000	Hold on.
43000	45000	I'm so sorry.
45000	50000	Everything broke from yesterday.
50000	54000	And my headset isn't registering sound at all.
54000	56000	I knew it wasn't.
56000	59000	You're lying to me.
59000	62000	Oh, the scuff isn't working.
62000	65000	Oh, here we go.
65000	68000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
68000	71000	No, I just had to test it with some music.
71000	72000	Okay.
72000	75000	I can now hear the title music?
75000	77000	Yes, I can.
77000	79000	And you can hear it too.
79000	81000	I don't know how loud it's going to be though.
81000	82000	Oh my god.
82000	84000	Anything that can break will.
84000	88000	Well, I didn't change a single thing from yesterday's drum.
88000	92000	Oh, I apologize for being late.
92000	93000	Little refunds.
93000	95000	That was horrific.
95000	97000	I haven't even been able to watch yesterday's words.
97000	98000	I know the next stream is starting.
98000	100000	How are we meant to keep up with your strongy?
100000	103000	That's the fun part.
103000	106000	I have endless stamina.
106000	110000	See, those details come really good later on.
110000	113000	Right, I don't, I need to, I mean,
113000	115000	I'll tell you what world we're in.
115000	117000	Right now I'm entering world 424.
117000	120000	But I want tutorial island.
120000	122000	So please don't worry.
122000	123000	What was that first song?
123000	125000	It was called Music Makes You Lose Control.
125000	127000	Music makes you lose control.
127000	128000	Let's go.
128000	133000	Please don't worry if you've not actually got your character
133000	137000	outside good ol' Lummi Castle, Lumbridge Castle.
137000	139000	I've not even done the tutorial part.
139000	140000	I do.
140000	142000	I'm playing with a plugin called Runelight.
142000	145000	But we're just going through tutorial island super quick.
145000	146000	I'm not.
146000	151000	Oh no, I just liked it a brand new.
151000	157000	Oh, we're doing an indepth in tutorial island then.
157000	159000	Ah.
159000	163000	Ah.
163000	167000	I've actually been smart and I've prepared a whole meal.
167000	170000	It was absolutely chaos getting, like,
170000	172000	I was trying to get Runelight to work on screen
172000	174000	and I was trying to cook fricking my,
174000	177000	well, technically my breakfast, but I call it dinner.
177000	181000	But, and I actually have, like, the world's saddest fricking rose,
181000	185000	I think it's called, like, rosemary sauce when you have it with shrimp.
185000	187000	And, ah.
187000	191000	So, I do have membership.
191000	193000	As is in the finalized world, please,
193000	195000	I've not even got through this tutorial.
195000	197000	Right, let me just skip through this fricking tutorial.
197000	199000	Oh, my phone's in the way.
199000	200000	Oh, my God, no.
200000	201000	I can't skip this.
201000	204000	This is going to take so long.
204000	205000	Oh, right.
205000	207000	Yes, we'll talk to the survival specialist.
207000	209000	Look, that's what I'm eating right now.
209000	211000	Unironically, I'm eating that right now.
211000	212000	I'm good.
212000	213000	Wait a minute.
213000	215000	This game's based on real life.
215000	216000	How cool is that?
216000	217000	We're going fishing.
217000	218000	Would you fish me up?
218000	219000	Huh?
219000	220000	But anyway, good morning.
220000	221000	Good evening.
221000	222000	Good afternoon.
222000	223000	I apologize.
223000	224000	It's been fricking chaos.
224000	225000	Since there is no work tomorrow,
225000	227000	I'm commit to catch the full stream today.
227000	228000	No way.
228000	230000	Thank you for the tip, Virginia.
230000	231000	There is no way.
231000	232000	Literally.
232000	234000	Oh, ace the con, Snow Bear June, as well.
234000	235000	Thank you for the tip.
235000	236000	I'm about to munch on.
236000	239000	I've got bex, pate, oh.
239000	240000	Right.
240000	241000	And then I've got shrimp.
241000	243000	And then I've got a rose, a sauce,
243000	245000	while I've not made it correctly,
245000	247000	because I didn't fricking squeeze the water
247000	249000	out of the prawns.
249000	250000	Hi, ready?
250000	251000	Hi, ready?
251000	253000	Hi, acey and Snowberry Raiders.
253000	255000	But if you put all those words together,
255000	256000	it becomes reading.
256000	258000	Are you splitting me right now?
258000	259000	Strony.
259000	261000	You're eating marshmallows last night
261000	263000	inspired me to try to write something
263000	265000	to make your heart flutter,
265000	267000	because I think it's adorable.
267000	269000	Are you going to read more tonight?
269000	271000	I can definitely read more.
271000	273000	Thank you very much, Gramble, for the tip.
273000	275000	Yeah, I can definitely read more.
275000	276000	Oh, I'm sorry to...
276000	278000	Trying to eat and beat and vape
278000	280000	and do everything all at once.
280000	281000	Hi, we're playing RuneScape,
281000	282000	an old-school RuneScape.
282000	283000	We're going to play multiplayer
283000	285000	and do quests together.
285000	287000	I am called Scottlefish,
287000	289000	because I totally did not steal that from a roofling.
289000	291000	Thank you very much.
291000	293000	But yeah,
293000	295000	we're going to do good.
295000	296000	I am not...
296000	298000	I'm going to move to a free world,
298000	300000	but if you want to make a new account,
300000	302000	we are going to do, like, the free quest,
302000	303000	like, Cook's Assistant and that.
303000	305000	Where the heck am I supposed to go?
305000	306000	I don't know.
306000	307000	I'm not paying attention.
307000	309000	Now that you have logged, it's time to light fire.
309000	310000	Oh, okay, pardon me.
310000	311000	Pardon me, excuse me.
311000	312000	I'm going to take a bite.
312000	313000	Ah.
313000	314000	Hi, it's Trombone.
314000	315000	What a nickname.
315000	317000	I should have thrown it that bad.
317000	318000	See?
318000	320000	So I've got this plugin
320000	321000	called RuneLight.
321000	323000	And, at least, it's really good.
323000	324000	I think it's really good.
324000	325000	If the game needs to be louder,
325000	326000	please do tell me.
326000	328000	I actually think it does need to be louder.
328000	329000	Because I'm, like,
329000	331000	screaming over all the things.
331000	332000	What next?
332000	333000	Moving on.
333000	334000	Well done.
334000	335000	Moving on.
335000	336000	Moving on.
336000	338000	I've completely forgotten how
338000	339000	the tutorial goes,
339000	341000	because it's been so long.
341000	345000	I'ma take another bite of my food.
345000	347000	But, yeah, if you want to join in,
347000	348000	don't worry, you can literally
348000	349000	make a character right now
349000	351000	and be faster than me.
351000	353000	I will tell you what world we're on.
353000	355000	We're all going to meet outside
355000	357000	of Lumbridge Castle.
357000	360000	So whenever what world we'll get,
360000	363000	we will do a Chicky Lumbridge Castle.
363000	365000	And then we'll take it one by one
365000	367000	and we'll quest.
367000	368000	Right?
368000	370000	Let's start with Cook's Assistant,
370000	372000	because, obviously, this is a bit squished.
372000	377000	And my goal is to get 99 cooking live.
377000	379000	Like, not in this one stream.
379000	380000	Okay, not in this one stream.
380000	381000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
381000	382000	I don't know how to do that.
382000	384000	Although, I think of Fletching.
384000	386000	If you have, like, a ton of GP,
386000	388000	you can actually get 99 Fletching
388000	390000	in one day or something like that.
390000	392000	I can't remember.
392000	393000	I think it's Fletching.
393000	395000	You can kind of smurf of it,
395000	397000	smurf of the cheese of it.
397000	399000	All in one stream, crazy.
399000	400000	No, no, stop getting hype.
400000	402000	It's not happening in one stream.
402000	403000	Okay, quest journal.
403000	406000	Yep, you're going to do the free quest first
406000	408000	as best as we can.
408000	411000	And then we might move on to membership quest,
411000	413000	but I do want to give Beefling the chance
413000	415000	to come hang at Lummi Castle, the glum castle.
415000	417000	Any, any lummers?
417000	419000	Any hashtag, a lummer?
419000	421000	I'm taking a little bit.
421000	423000	It's super expensive for a member.
423000	425000	Yeah, it's really expensive, actually,
425000	427000	to do the thing, but, um,
427000	429000	membership in this game is so expensive.
429000	431000	I remember
431000	433000	I asked my mum
434000	437000	to buy me membership when I was away,
437000	439000	and it was, like,
439000	441000	cheap as anything, and she never got me it,
441000	443000	because she didn't understand what the game was,
443000	445000	and she was like, why do you need it?
445000	446000	Why do you need it?
446000	447000	I'm like, mum!
447000	449000	I want membership!
449000	451000	Ryan!
456000	458000	No way!
458000	459000	Are you...
459000	461000	You must have been so many iron reaper
461000	464000	that I managed to get an eight hour sleep
464000	466000	after that stream.
466000	468000	I don't know how long the endurance stream...
468000	470000	It was, like, three quid the last time I got it.
470000	472000	Honestly, I remember, like, begging my mum,
472000	474000	I was like, mum!
474000	477000	I want membership, but she never understood my games.
477000	479000	And then that's when I go to Dad.
479000	481000	See, Dad, Dad knew.
481000	483000	Dad knew what was going on. He knew the games.
484000	486000	Mum and Dad!
486000	487000	What were we doing?
487000	488000	I'm not talking, I'm right.
488000	490000	Hello, my name is Skullfish!
491000	492000	I still live.
492000	494000	I usually sleep four or five.
494000	496000	You guys all insomniacs, I got four hours.
496000	497000	Good enough for me.
497000	499000	Bro, that's not healthy, honestly.
499000	501000	I woke up and I felt sick today,
501000	503000	and I was like,
503000	505000	is that because
505000	508000	you will be told to equip items later?
508000	511000	You don't have access to the interface for equipment items?
511000	513000	Oh, okay, one more, thank you.
513000	514000	Right, shovel on now.
514000	515000	Oh, okay.
515000	517000	Are you squiddin' me right now?
517000	518000	Brian!
520000	521000	No!
524000	526000	Oh, I actually quite like that sentiment.
526000	528000	Thank you, Tim Shortle.
528000	530000	I think Tim Shortle's the way I'm supposed to say it,
530000	532000	because there's no way it's like any other way.
532000	534000	Right, let's go.
534000	535000	Combat interface, right?
535000	536000	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
536000	538000	Oh, beautiful, let's stab.
538000	540000	Give him a little stabby stab.
540000	541000	Damn rats.
541000	543000	All right, hold on, hold on.
543000	544000	Nope, too far, too far.
544000	545000	Inbought, inbought.
545000	546000	I...
546000	548000	Whenever I've watched RuneScape Streamers,
548000	550000	they're always super zoomed in.
550000	551000	They're like, oh yeah, look at that.
551000	552000	And I'm like, bro,
552000	554000	I need to be able to see what I'm looking at.
554000	555000	I can see the health bar,
555000	556000	I can see everything,
556000	558000	and we battle down the area.
559000	560000	I'm not setting anything up
560000	562000	before anyone complains.
562000	563000	Chat sleep.
563000	566000	Chat needs to rest as much as me.
567000	569000	I've got absolutely no sleep at all.
569000	570000	Are you all insomniacs?
570000	571000	You're all...
571000	573000	Literally all holding on for the ASMR stream.
573000	576000	I'm getting my nails done
576000	579000	after the ASMR stream.
579000	580000	So I hope you're all ready.
580000	581000	Wait, what am I supposed to do?
581000	582000	Oh no, wait, sorry.
582000	584000	I'm supposed to do range weaponry.
584000	586000	Can I do it from through the gate?
586000	587000	Oh, I can.
587000	588000	It's cheating.
588000	589000	Didn't realize old-school room shape...
589000	592000	Oh, didn't realize old-school RuneScape membership is 8'9".
593000	594000	No!
595000	597000	Bro, the inflation has hands.
597000	598000	I'm sorry, but...
599000	600000	All these things being like,
600000	601000	oh no, cost of living.
601000	602000	Well, you're not paying your pay...
602000	604000	You're not paying your employees more.
604000	605000	So I don't know why we're pretending
605000	606000	the cost of living is a thing
606000	607000	for these companies.
607000	608000	That's it also.
611000	612000	You're doing your nails
612000	614000	for the sweet-eating stream.
614000	615000	Uh, yeah.
615000	617000	How else are you going to, you know,
617000	618000	do my hands?
619000	621000	You need to be able to imagine
621000	623000	my hand wrapped around...
623000	624000	That's terrible.
624000	625000	We're just started.
625000	626000	I was doing a lot of food filming.
626000	627000	Oh my god, I'm rich!
627000	628000	I'm rich!
628000	629000	We're rich!
629000	631000	I've got 25 coins.
632000	634000	Are you squeezing me right now?
635000	636000	Brian!
643000	645000	That's because I had problems sleeping.
645000	648000	Thank you for the tip, Tharya.
649000	650000	Oh my god.
650000	651000	Right, so you can do voting.
651000	652000	Like, if you're like hardcore,
652000	654000	well, it's not really actually,
654000	656000	but it's actually quite quick to get the...
656000	658000	Oh, I've just skipped past the bit that tells you.
658000	660000	Oh, what should we vote on?
660000	664000	Should Firelight a new level 77 demon bait?
664000	665000	Bro, I...
665000	666000	I've not...
666000	668000	Whoa, these are like the same question,
668000	669000	but different.
670000	671000	I have not...
671000	673000	I have not played enough RuneScape.
673000	676000	I'm like the basic RuneScape part, okay?
676000	678000	Before you think I'm going to start getting prayer pots out,
678000	680000	I'm going to start, uh,
680000	681000	what is it called?
681000	683000	Like, PKN.
683000	685000	No, I'm not PKN.
685000	686000	I'm not doing that.
686000	687000	I'm not happening.
687000	689000	No, I'm called Squatfish.
689000	691000	I've got membership 30 days left.
691000	693000	Oh, no, you can't see it because I'm a big ass, hey.
694000	696000	Who's grabbing this?
696000	697000	What world?
697000	699000	Okay, world can hold 2,000 members.
699000	700000	Okay.
700000	701000	We're very lucky,
701000	703000	but I don't think there's 2,000 recently
703000	705000	available at StreamSnipe.
705000	707000	So, uh, the good thing...
707000	709000	Oh god, it's probably a bit too heavy.
709000	711000	Please don't show my email and password.
711000	712000	That would kind of suck.
712000	714000	But then again, let's just throw away the purpose.
715000	718000	On the way to victory, to victory, to victory.
718000	720000	I'm on the way to victory.
720000	721000	So, into the church I go.
721000	723000	Hello, mister...
723000	725000	Hello, Mr. Brace.
725000	726000	Any bracers?
726000	727000	What is PKN?
727000	728000	Player killing.
728000	731000	It's when you attack players
731000	734000	and you sell the goods that they drop, basically.
734000	737000	But, uh, before anyone thinks I'm going to turn into PKN,
737000	738000	yeah, good luck, mate.
738000	739000	That's what happens.
741000	743000	I'm doing this tutorial right now.
744000	747000	I'm going to eat my food outside Lumbridge
747000	749000	so everyone can get a chance to group up
749000	750000	if you want to start on a new account
750000	752000	if you can go questing together.
752000	754000	So please don't panic if you think, like,
754000	756000	oh no, I've not got enough time to join in.
756000	758000	You absolutely do.
758000	761000	I am going to make it so.
761000	763000	I eat my foodies.
763000	767000	I've got a cola and two bottles of water with me.
767000	770000	Um, as for those of you interested,
770000	773000	if this is, uh, an...
773000	775000	Where the heck?
780000	781000	Oh, it's...
781000	782000	Where the heck am I supposed to go?
782000	783000	It's not blinking anything.
785000	786000	I'm grabbing the booze.
786000	788000	You will be shown how to cast spells.
788000	789000	When you get there, just talk to the magic instructor.
789000	791000	I assume you can hear them.
791000	793000	Oh, of course it pops up.
793000	794000	What are we doing?
794000	795000	I'll hop on.
795000	797000	We're going to just do basic questing
797000	799000	because I've started a fresh account
799000	802000	and we're going to try and get 99 Kooten.
802000	805000	However, open up your final menu.
805000	806000	Ah!
806000	807000	Am I done?
807000	808000	Okay, not yet.
808000	810000	We're about to teleport to Lummi
810000	812000	and then I'll pick a free-to-play server.
812000	814000	Um, and...
814000	816000	Oh my god, I'm casting the chicken.
818000	820000	You wouldn't cast the chicken, would you?
820000	821000	Would you?
821000	823000	Who goes there?
823000	826000	Everyone has some when you trust a lure into the world, eh?
827000	828000	Can I?
828000	830000	I'm so sorry, but I'm going to confess
830000	832000	my biggest sin,
832000	834000	and you guys honestly aren't ready for it.
834000	837000	I used to be double in money
837000	839000	and take people's money.
839000	842000	The biggest amount I ever took was 100K gold
842000	843000	and then I stopped.
843000	846000	I don't know how I didn't get banned.
846000	849000	I think because I did it in such low increments.
849000	850000	Um...
850000	852000	Right, send me to the mainland.
854000	855000	I'm so sorry.
855000	857000	I used to be the one at the Grand Exchange.
857000	859000	I was like a little kid
859000	860000	because what happened was
860000	862000	I got fricking scammed.
862000	863000	Hey, Scottfish, come over here.
863000	864000	Adventure or John?
864000	866000	Um, I got scammed
866000	868000	and then I realized, wait,
868000	870000	I can just scam other people
870000	871000	to get my money back!
871000	872000	Double in gold!
872000	874000	Double in gold!
874000	876000	And I'm like, I got all the money I lost back.
876000	877000	It's time.
877000	878000	Officers, it's her.
878000	880000	Literally, I was like a little
880000	882000	nine-year-old hustler, like,
882000	884000	like, oh, it's terrible.
884000	887000	So if you ever got done at the Grand Exchange
887000	889000	because you were a silly, silly McGee,
889000	890000	guess what?
890000	892000	It was probably me!
892000	894000	We're gonna hang out at this fountain
894000	896000	at Lummi Castle right here.
896000	898000	We're gonna hang out at the little fountain.
898000	900000	I am going to Swap World.
900000	901000	Wait, why is it flashing?
901000	902000	It's...
902000	903000	Why it's flashing?
903000	905000	Right, what world are we gonna go to?
905000	908000	I'll make it a free-to-play world.
908000	909000	Where...
909000	910000	How do I...
910000	911000	Change worlds?
911000	912000	Whoa!
913000	914000	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
914000	916000	I think World Shifter's up here.
916000	917000	Okay!
917000	918000	Um...
918000	920000	Free-to-play trade?
920000	922000	No, it's got 900 people in it already.
922000	924000	Do we want free-to-play trade?
925000	927000	There's 900 people in it?
927000	929000	Jagex is watching you now.
929000	930000	They better not be!
931000	932000	I'm in trouble.
932000	934000	We're gonna hang out at Lummi Castle
934000	936000	until I've finished my dinner.
936000	939000	I'm trying to eat it on my breakfast.
939000	940000	Everything's set.
941000	942000	What world do we want?
942000	943000	Free-to-play is good.
943000	944000	Right, we'll just do the classic
944000	947000	free-to-play trade-free world 301.
947000	949000	There's 900 folk in it,
949000	951000	so we've got all the room in the world.
952000	953000	Take me...
953000	955000	Are you sure you wish to go to World 301?
955000	956000	Yes, sir!
956000	957000	Let's...
957000	958000	Let's cycle!
962000	963000	Okay.
963000	965000	I don't know where the heck the reef ones are,
965000	967000	so we'll come a little over to the fountain.
970000	971000	Oh, no!
971000	972000	What are they used?
973000	974000	I don't know.
974000	975000	We might need to...
975000	976000	I don't know.
977000	978000	I don't want...
978000	980000	Are these reeflings in game?
980000	981000	Wait, wait, wait.
981000	982000	We're gonna go over to the tree
982000	984000	to make sure these are reeflings.
985000	987000	Holy crap, are they?
988000	989000	Brian!
993000	994000	Evening, Alessandro.
994000	995000	Thank you for the tip.
995000	996000	Oh, my God!
996000	997000	They're reeflings!
997000	998000	Oh, my God.
999000	1000000	Oh, you're looking at...
1000000	1001000	Oh, my God.
1001000	1002000	Wait, you guys are actual...
1002000	1004000	Some of you are actual players, though.
1004000	1006000	Oh, why are you so high level?
1007000	1009000	Oh, someone's got tiny cuttles.
1009000	1010000	That's funny.
1010000	1012000	Wait, you guys are like actual...
1012000	1013000	I miss Fauna.
1013000	1015000	It's such a good name.
1015000	1016000	Oh, my God.
1016000	1017000	Just yummy.
1017000	1019000	Hello, hello.
1019000	1020000	Oh, my God.
1020000	1022000	You guys are like actual skillers and stuff.
1024000	1025000	Good morning, reeflings.
1025000	1026000	They're saying,
1026000	1027000	Oh, that's crazy.
1027000	1029000	Strony surprise attack gamers.
1029000	1031000	I know, but I didn't know if you guys were going...
1031000	1032000	Oh, my God.
1032000	1033000	You stole my drip.
1033000	1035000	You look like me.
1035000	1036000	Oh, you guys...
1036000	1037000	You get stood on.
1037000	1039000	I see a Strony.
1039000	1041000	You guys are like so high level.
1041000	1042000	That's amazing.
1042000	1044000	You guys should probably teach me how to play the game.
1045000	1046000	Unfortunately, we can't...
1046000	1048000	What is that?
1048000	1050000	Why is he standing like that?
1050000	1052000	What does it mean?
1052000	1054000	Am I to raid him like a pony?
1056000	1059000	Oh, the guy's got the magma cape.
1059000	1061000	I've never done the magma cape before.
1061000	1063000	I have a stupid snowflake account.
1063000	1064000	So I won't join.
1064000	1066000	What does that mean?
1066000	1068000	I have a snowflake account.
1069000	1070000	Steals her legs.
1070000	1072000	Snowflake, by the way.
1072000	1074000	What does that mean?
1074000	1075000	Oh, my God.
1075000	1076000	Look at your fit.
1076000	1077000	Your outfit's so unique.
1077000	1079000	You're holding a puppy.
1079000	1082000	And you've got like little things going on on you.
1083000	1084000	Right.
1084000	1086000	A lot of you are like over leveled like heck.
1086000	1088000	What is this in his hand?
1088000	1089000	A fish.
1089000	1091000	Is that me in his hand?
1091000	1092000	Come on, guys.
1094000	1096000	Oh, why is your name that?
1096000	1097000	Oh, no.
1097000	1099000	Why would you rename yourself?
1099000	1100000	Oh, no.
1101000	1103000	Trick or treat.
1103000	1105000	Let me take.
1105000	1107000	I don't think I get...
1109000	1111000	We want to see what you got, Sans.
1111000	1113000	Show us what you got whilst I eat my dinner.
1114000	1116000	Where did he go?
1116000	1118000	Wait, did he just disappear because I looked down for one second?
1118000	1120000	It says you guys want to trade me,
1120000	1123000	but I don't think I can trade because I'm a new account.
1123000	1125000	I don't think it works.
1125000	1128000	I think I need to go quest and to like unlock trade.
1128000	1130000	If you guys are wanting to give me anything.
1130000	1132000	Is it in the stream to trade?
1132000	1134000	Yeah, like I don't think you guys can trade me anything.
1134000	1135000	So don't worry.
1135000	1137000	We're going to go quest and RIP, yeah.
1141000	1143000	Wait, I'm getting the fish.
1143000	1145000	There's so many riblings.
1145000	1147000	Hello, riblings.
1147000	1149000	Thank you, everyone that can join.
1149000	1151000	Yo, we're deforestation out here.
1151000	1153000	Oh, they leveled up. Let's go.
1154000	1155000	Okay.
1155000	1157000	Trick it is.
1157000	1158000	Jeez.
1158000	1159000	Yeah, look.
1159000	1160000	Accept trade.
1160000	1163000	I don't think you can trade because I'm a new, new, new account.
1163000	1164000	What?
1164000	1166000	Are you giving me?
1166000	1168000	A rope and a fish?
1168000	1170000	Are you telling me?
1170000	1172000	Are you doing that?
1172000	1173000	No way.
1173000	1174000	You can trade that.
1174000	1175000	No way.
1175000	1178000	I have a fricking rope in my inventory right now.
1180000	1182000	Wait, can you only give me like World 301?
1182000	1184000	Yeah, this world is full sad.
1184000	1185000	Why?
1186000	1188000	Oh, the world is full.
1189000	1190000	Okay.
1190000	1191000	Wait, wait, hold on.
1191000	1193000	Right, we're going to move to...
1193000	1195000	We're not doing...
1195000	1197000	I don't know what these are.
1197000	1199000	The regular bought items can't be traded.
1199000	1200000	Okay, we're learning.
1200000	1201000	Right.
1201000	1204000	The world is full, so we're going to go to an emptier one.
1204000	1205000	Everyone get ready.
1205000	1206000	High risk world.
1206000	1207000	Yeah, no thanks.
1207000	1209000	I have a bow.
1210000	1213000	Is there like a really easy one we can get inside?
1214000	1216000	Clan Wars?
1216000	1217000	I don't know.
1217000	1218000	Do we get grouped on?
1218000	1220000	Are we technically a clan?
1220000	1221000	No.
1223000	1226000	These are just dead Oz servers apparently?
1226000	1228000	Are these American?
1228000	1229000	380.
1229000	1230000	Someone says 380.
1230000	1231000	Hold on.
1231000	1232000	380.
1232000	1233000	Right.
1233000	1234000	World 380.
1234000	1236000	And we're going to Brit Bungland.
1236000	1237000	Right, let's go 380.
1237000	1238000	World 380.
1238000	1240000	Wait, I'm double clicking.
1240000	1242000	Let me go.
1242000	1243000	380.
1243000	1247000	Grand exchanges limited to until you do quests or play for a while.
1248000	1250000	Now you have the fish.
1250000	1252000	You're canonically strong.
1253000	1254000	Okay, okay.
1254000	1256000	Oh, look at the replays.
1257000	1258000	Okay.
1258000	1259000	World 380.
1259000	1260000	How do you dance?
1260000	1261000	Oh my God.
1261000	1262000	It's been so long.
1262000	1263000	How do you dance?
1263000	1264000	I want to dance too.
1268000	1269000	I can dance.
1269000	1270000	I'm sure I can dance.
1270000	1271000	Hold on.
1271000	1272000	Let's go.
1272000	1273000	Grand.
1273000	1274000	Little dance.
1274000	1275000	Look at that.
1275000	1276000	Look at that.
1276000	1277000	Look at that.
1277000	1278000	Look at that.
1278000	1279000	What?
1279000	1280000	What?
1280000	1281000	I'm stunning on them.
1281000	1282000	I'm stunning on them.
1282000	1283000	Look at them.
1283000	1284000	Whoa.
1284000	1287000	What in the pivot axis was that?
1287000	1288000	That was awful.
1288000	1289000	Don't ever do that again.
1289000	1290000	Right, we're clapping.
1293000	1294000	Okay, now dance honestly.
1294000	1296000	Grand exchanges limited to 8.
1296000	1297000	That's not a clan.
1297000	1298000	That's an army.
1298000	1299000	Oh yeah?
1299000	1303000	Will we do the refland clan and we'll go pk'ing like other clans or something?
1303000	1305000	As if I know how the combat works.
1305000	1311000	This only world where the text matters is PvP, high-risk, total and demo.
1311000	1312000	Right.
1312000	1315000	Are you ready to do the first official quest?
1315000	1319000	Or I say that as if I've even hardly eaten any of my dinner.
1319000	1320000	Hold on.
1320000	1323000	I'm trying to eat but I'm such a blabbermouth.
1323000	1324000	Honestly.
1324000	1325000	I can't stop.
1325000	1327000	I'm glad the refland's not stacking into one space.
1327000	1330000	Astroni can appreciate them each.
1330000	1331000	Yeah.
1331000	1336000	I'm still convinced that guy wants me to ride him.
1336000	1340000	Because he's like a horse, literally.
1341000	1343000	I'm so cute.
1343000	1344000	Still got people doing tutorials.
1344000	1346000	Yeah, don't worry if you're still doing tutorial island.
1346000	1349000	I'm gonna inhale my dinner really quickly.
1349000	1350000	I'm gonna try my best.
1350000	1352000	What is that noise?
1352000	1353000	You're all making noises.
1353000	1355000	I can't believe it.
1355000	1358000	I'm driving the bug.
1358000	1363000	I'm still trying to log in.
1363000	1366000	You're not giving people time to do the tutorial.
1366000	1369000	Only the players flexing their heads.
1369000	1370000	How many?
1370000	1371000	Oh my god.
1371000	1373000	Oh, that's just an MBC hand.
1373000	1376000	Oh, someone just leveled up.
1376000	1379000	Look at how high level you guys are.
1379000	1383000	Literally got the pepper, the frog over there.
1383000	1386000	I love mummy.
1386000	1388000	Oh my god.
1388000	1389000	Sad.
1389000	1390000	Like you're your name.
1390000	1392000	Just Yome.
1392000	1394000	You guys are like actual gamers.
1394000	1395000	Oh my god.
1395000	1396000	You're much better than me.
1396000	1398000	I'm like scared to play the game.
1398000	1400000	I'm like you guys are gonna show me off.
1400000	1404000	Quality player is determined by their agility and rune crafting level.
1404000	1405000	Yeah, yeah.
1405000	1407000	No one likes rune crafting.
1407000	1408000	You're not selling it here.
1408000	1411000	Get your propaganda useless out of here because you're not.
1411000	1414000	Rune crafting is the worst.
1414000	1418000	Unless you literally have an entire army behind you to help.
1418000	1423000	It ain't happening.
1423000	1425000	At the end of the stream you'll be that high level.
1425000	1428000	Ah, I think not.
1428000	1431000	Yeah, I need to have agility.
1431000	1433000	89.
1433000	1435000	You're really good at going in a circle then.
1435000	1436000	Jeez.
1436000	1441000	My brother was a Rinscape essence slaver for years.
1441000	1444000	Do you pay to like carry the thing?
1444000	1446000	Just don't please tell me.
1446000	1448000	Banks are for squares.
1448000	1450000	Are you an iron man?
1450000	1454000	Oh, so there's different types of players you can be.
1454000	1460000	If you're an iron man it means you don't have access to bank or something like that.
1460000	1463000	Guardians of the Rift is experienced also.
1463000	1465000	It's also experienced.
1465000	1467000	So will this be a 28 hour marathon?
1467000	1469000	No, no, I don't think it's a marathon.
1469000	1474000	I said yesterday I thought it was a marathon but I woke up and I don't actually feel that well today.
1474000	1475000	I can't believe it.
1475000	1478000	I can't believe streaming for 12 hours making me feel a bit wonky.
1478000	1485000	I don't know why because essentially I would sit at the PC and work on like it and for like ASMR or something like that.
1485000	1487000	But why is it when a streamer feels sick?
1487000	1488000	Like it doesn't make sense.
1488000	1491000	I feel weak in stream height honestly.
1491000	1494000	Free cuttlefish mustache rights here.
1494000	1497000	That's awful.
1497000	1499000	Oh, how did you...
1499000	1501000	What?
1501000	1504000	Ah, are you just cuttlefish right in front of us?
1504000	1507000	I didn't know Rinscape had emotes like this.
1507000	1509000	More active for streaming.
1509000	1511000	Maybe because you did it three times this week.
1511000	1512000	Me?
1512000	1515000	Isn't every strong stream technically a marathon honestly?
1515000	1518000	Damn, how does one become an essence run slave?
1518000	1520000	That's good money for that hour.
1520000	1521000	The members emotes go hard.
1521000	1522000	Strong party.
1522000	1523000	Heck yeah.
1523000	1525000	There's so many reflings.
1525000	1530000	The servers are like who on earth are all these people?
1530000	1532000	D refling.
1533000	1535000	I'll read out your name if it's refling related,
1535000	1537000	but I was trying not to accidentally say anything.
1537000	1539000	Who is leveling up there?
1539000	1540000	Freaking...
1540000	1544000	I can hear someone leveling up and it's always going doot doot doot doot doot doot.
1544000	1546000	Hello?
1546000	1548000	Jack the Ripper's coming to get us lads.
1548000	1549000	We're done for.
1549000	1551000	Maybe it was your screaming yesterday, bro.
1551000	1552000	I was so annoyed.
1552000	1554000	I listened back.
1554000	1556000	I didn't realise how angry I got.
1556000	1558000	Like I got angry.
1558000	1560000	Wow.
1561000	1563000	Oh, it's a skill cape or more?
1563000	1566000	Oh my god, he's got the fishing skill cape.
1568000	1570000	Ah, jacquem prongs.
1570000	1572000	Jacquem prongs, wee wee.
1572000	1574000	What is this freaking UFO over here?
1574000	1575000	What is that?
1575000	1576000	Oh, is that prey?
1576000	1578000	Is that questing?
1578000	1580000	You've done all quests.
1580000	1583000	Oh, you've got all the jelly.
1583000	1585000	Oh my god.
1585000	1586000	Wait, what's the cooking one?
1586000	1588000	Does anyone have 99 cooking?
1588000	1589000	What's the cooking or more?
1589000	1591000	Oh, I can't wait to get it.
1593000	1595000	Oh, look at us all.
1595000	1597000	Well, binchinning.
1597000	1599000	Binchinning.
1599000	1601000	How do I change servers?
1601000	1603000	Um...
1603000	1606000	I'm on the runelight, so it's plug-in, so it's up here.
1606000	1609000	But if you're not on the runelight plug-in,
1609000	1611000	it's...
1613000	1615000	Down the bottom somewhere.
1615000	1616000	Smile.
1616000	1618000	It's on the cog, I think.
1619000	1621000	I have two baked potatoes.
1621000	1623000	I've not even finished the first one,
1623000	1624000	and it's frickin' totey.
1624000	1626000	Like, it's so small.
1626000	1628000	I'm trying so I can't eat and talk,
1628000	1630000	and it'd be entertaining at the same time.
1630000	1632000	Quest cape, quest cape.
1632000	1633000	Ah.
1633000	1635000	Max capers shaming us all.
1635000	1639000	Click the top right eggs, then you'll see worlds switcher on the bottom.
1639000	1643000	The door icon to hop worlds is what they're saying.
1643000	1645000	Refillins are so MLG pro, honestly.
1645000	1647000	Like, we're not even gay people.
1648000	1649000	Oh, you're so green!
1649000	1651000	This refilling's, like, literally so green.
1653000	1654000	That's amazing.
1654000	1656000	Maybe we should...
1656000	1659000	Amala to tell us to all go buy green capes.
1659000	1660000	For strawney.
1660000	1662000	And then we all just walk around with green capes,
1662000	1664000	and, like, whenever we pass someone, they'll be like,
1664000	1666000	huh, what's going on over there?
1666000	1669000	Why are they all doing their thing?
1670000	1671000	Wishes to trade with you.
1671000	1676000	So, I can't accept anything outside of, like, regular trades.
1676000	1677000	I know.
1678000	1679000	You get...
1680000	1683000	You're giving me your crusty cum sock.
1683000	1685000	No!
1685000	1687000	No!
1687000	1688000	Wait.
1689000	1692000	I have a crusty cum sock on my inventory.
1695000	1697000	How did you even get that?
1699000	1700000	Okay.
1700000	1701000	Gently used.
1701000	1703000	Literally gently used.
1703000	1704000	Right.
1704000	1705000	I'm gonna eat.
1705000	1707000	I'm gonna save maybe a five-minute countdown,
1707000	1709000	and then we're gonna start with Cook's insistent,
1709000	1710000	and we'll take it from there.
1710000	1713000	So, for those of you who haven't made an account,
1713000	1721000	we are on World 380.
1721000	1723000	And we're outside Lung Bridge Castle.
1723000	1725000	When you spawn in, we are literally just...
1725000	1728000	You'll spawn in this way, and we're the left of the castle.
1728000	1729000	We're just hanging out here,
1729000	1730000	because we don't want to bother anyone
1730000	1732000	that might be spawning in over here.
1732000	1734000	But I'm starting with the character's pink hair,
1734000	1735000	or my same pink.
1735000	1736000	Mine has ginger hair.
1736000	1738000	Like, I'm a junior.
1739000	1740000	Which thing?
1740000	1742000	And then I've got green top,
1742000	1743000	and then pink...
1743000	1744000	I think...
1744000	1746000	Prepared to get billied nerds!
1751000	1753000	I'm trying to eat so fast.
1753000	1754000	It's hard.
1754000	1755000	Honestly.
1756000	1758000	I hope you guys have got hydration and eating.
1758000	1761000	I don't know if it's an endurance stream yet.
1761000	1762000	Okay.
1762000	1763000	But...
1770000	1772000	Ginger hair, cute outfit, and a rope.
1772000	1773000	Yeah, yeah.
1773000	1774000	You can get at me.
1774000	1775000	380.
1775000	1776000	Yeah, 380.
1777000	1779000	The refling in the game, of course, is gonna be...
1779000	1781000	Don't stop until you get 99.
1781000	1783000	Bro, you think I can stream until 99?
1783000	1784000	Cooking?
1784000	1785000	I don't even know how to, like,
1785000	1787000	maximise cooking.
1787000	1789000	The closest I ever got was, like, 80,
1789000	1791000	but I'd rather do it live with you guys.
1793000	1795000	Buying girlfriend 50 gold.
1795000	1797000	What happened to party hats?
1797000	1798000	I don't remember people were, like,
1798000	1801000	renting party hats in quotation marks.
1801000	1803000	I don't know what that means at all.
1813000	1814000	Delicious coke.
1814000	1816000	I say delicious as if...
1816000	1818000	it's just not a regular fizzy juice.
1819000	1822000	Well, actually, it's, like, one of the most popular fizzy juices, so...
1825000	1828000	They decided not to have exclusive one-time items.
1828000	1830000	Oh, even though they're tradable?
1831000	1833000	I guess they didn't, like, give enough out?
1833000	1834000	Possible?
1835000	1836000	They can...
1836000	1837000	They became common.
1837000	1838000	Oh!
1838000	1839000	They made it common.
1841000	1843000	You go to a good place for cooking
1843000	1845000	and you cook till the number says 99,
1845000	1847000	or you run out of money.
1847000	1848000	With some of the fish.
1848000	1850000	Okay, you're done.
1851000	1853000	Oh, people are getting, uh...
1853000	1854000	minigames.
1856000	1857000	I was, like, I'm saying,
1857000	1859000	come along with me, Miss...
1859000	1860000	I Miss Fauna.
1861000	1863000	Wakey-wakey, I Miss Fauna.
1867000	1869000	Max Capers.
1869000	1870000	How much playtime?
1870000	1872000	232 days says one.
1872000	1875000	314 says another.
1876000	1877000	I can't believe my little...
1877000	1879000	My little reeflings are adorable little nerds!
1879000	1880000	I can't believe it!
1880000	1882000	You can do just a feckin' adorable!
1882000	1884000	Any language game?
1885000	1886000	That's so precious.
1886000	1887000	I'm glad you found a game
1887000	1888000	that you really enjoy
1888000	1890000	and can, uh, throw yourself inside.
1890000	1891000	It's... When you find that game,
1891000	1892000	it's really nice.
1893000	1894000	Anyway, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,
1894000	1895000	let's get started.
1897000	1898000	Mmm.
1901000	1902000	Yesterday, Avatar,
1902000	1904000	No Capitalist Simulator.
1904000	1906000	This is all really a trust.
1906000	1909000	Someone says 63 days,
1909000	1912000	and I haven't even left this area,
1912000	1916000	uh, someone says 1,650 hours
1916000	1920000	for a total of 1,800...
1920000	1921000	I can't read numbers.
1921000	1922000	Uh, big number.
1922000	1924000	Big hours for big number.
1924000	1925000	Thank you.
1927000	1928000	Mmm.
1929000	1931000	Well, more reeflings?
1932000	1935000	Have we got more reeflings joining us?
1935000	1936000	Yeah?
1936000	1937000	Someone's got...
1937000	1938000	Oh, someone literally is called Swiss Oak.
1941000	1943000	A snowflake among snowflakes.
1943000	1944000	Wait, what am I missing?
1944000	1945000	What is this?
1945000	1946000	Is this, like, super runescape terms
1946000	1948000	that I don't know about yet?
1948000	1951000	Or is this literally, uh,
1951000	1953000	take the word heart
1953000	1955000	and remove the H and replace...
1955000	1956000	Remove the H and E
1956000	1958000	and replace it with an F.
1958000	1959000	Relax, snowflake.
1959000	1960000	It's called Dark Humor.
1960000	1961000	Is that the joke?
1961000	1963000	Or am I missing Platinum?
1963000	1966000	Respect for the Iron Man.
1966000	1967000	Snowflake accounts are accounts
1967000	1971000	that have extremely restrictive stipulations.
1971000	1972000	What does that even mean?
1972000	1974000	You've somehow...
1974000	1975000	You can't...
1975000	1977000	Snowflake is a special account.
1978000	1981000	Wait, the Venezuelans are the snowflakes?
1983000	1984000	Game is not degen enough.
1984000	1985000	We need to make it harder.
1985000	1986000	What the heck?
1986000	1987000	Honestly.
1987000	1994000	I think this girl in crossbones
1994000	1997000	means this guy's a p-care over here.
1997000	1998000	I'm okay.
1999000	2001000	Can only do content in a region.
2003000	2004000	Jeez.
2004000	2006000	One guy's playing the game
2006000	2008000	where if he takes damage,
2008000	2009000	all...
2009000	2010000	Oh, I know!
2010000	2012000	Uh, the...
2012000	2013000	Swamplet X guy.
2013000	2014000	Yeah.
2015000	2017000	I've not actually watched that series.
2017000	2019000	The No Hits run series,
2019000	2020000	but, yeah.
2020000	2021000	Region locked.
2021000	2022000	Oh, settle!
2022000	2023000	That's his name, not Swamplet X.
2025000	2027000	I have still not finished
2027000	2028000	the first fucking potato.
2028000	2030000	I'm actually getting annoyed now.
2030000	2031000	Why is the food not getting away
2031000	2032000	off my plate?
2035000	2037000	I'm inhaling it.
2037000	2038000	I'm so sorry.
2038000	2039000	I'm just gonna have to send it.
2040000	2041000	I can't.
2041000	2042000	I'm getting too distracted
2042000	2043000	trying to, like, talk into this.
2043000	2044000	I'm sending it.
2044000	2045000	This is the fastest freaking
2045000	2047000	eating you'll ever hear of me.
2048000	2049000	I'm chewing.
2049000	2050000	I'm chewing.
2051000	2053000	I've got another bit of potato.
2053000	2054000	I've never done this.
2054000	2055000	And, um...
2056000	2057000	Okay, I've had enough of eating.
2057000	2058000	I'm already bored of it.
2060000	2062000	I should weigh myself, honestly,
2062000	2064000	just so I don't lose too much weight,
2064000	2065000	because I stream too much.
2065000	2066000	I was actually wondering about that,
2066000	2068000	because I've not had a proper meal.
2068000	2069000	I'm, like, ages...
2069000	2070000	Ow.
2070000	2071000	I'll cut, I'll cut.
2071000	2072000	Done.
2072000	2075000	I'm a finger blade for my fucking plate.
2075000	2077000	I've tried to eat it.
2077000	2079000	It's taken too long.
2079000	2080000	Right.
2083000	2084000	Okay.
2084000	2086000	I was trying to eat a baked potato
2086000	2089000	in prawns, and it was just taken forever.
2090000	2091000	Oh, I've had enough.
2091000	2092000	Right.
2092000	2094000	Is this everyone who wants to show up?
2094000	2097000	Um, can chat, talk to me,
2097000	2099000	and tell me, is everyone here
2099000	2101000	that wants to be here?
2102000	2103000	Talking with your mouth full,
2103000	2104000	ASMR's running really...
2104000	2105000	It's fine.
2105000	2106000	Stop!
2106000	2107000	If that counts as ASMR,
2107000	2109000	then I've got a ton of content for you.
2110000	2112000	Okay, is everyone who wants to be
2112000	2115000	questing, is in the game right now?
2115000	2116000	Is anyone in Tutorial Island?
2116000	2117000	Someone says they're late.
2117000	2118000	Okay, we'll wait.
2118000	2119000	We'll wait.
2119000	2120000	We'll get a few more minutes.
2120000	2121000	Right.
2121000	2122000	If we've got a few more minutes,
2122000	2124000	it's time to start telling jokes.
2125000	2128000	Why did Ernest the chicken
2128000	2130000	cross the road?
2131000	2133000	To get to the other side.
2136000	2137000	Oh, thank you.
2137000	2138000	Thank you.
2138000	2139000	If you didn't know there's a quest
2139000	2140000	called Ernest the chicken.
2140000	2141000	Thank you.
2143000	2144000	I feel your pain.
2144000	2147000	Yes, do re-log in on your questing account
2147000	2149000	to render the other side.
2153000	2154000	I'm here.
2154000	2155000	I've never opened this game before.
2155000	2156000	Okay.
2156000	2158000	We'll stand outside the castle this time.
2158000	2160000	We're just gonna be right outside the castle.
2162000	2164000	If you want to start on a new quest
2164000	2166000	on the account just to have the shizz and giggles,
2166000	2168000	we are going to do a main quest.
2168000	2170000	Oh my god, there's so many reflings.
2170000	2172000	It's over.
2172000	2174000	Thank you so much for joining me.
2174000	2175000	I'm being the law.
2175000	2176000	I'm like so fucking happy.
2176000	2178000	Like, I don't realize that like,
2178000	2180000	oh my god, that's a lot of this playing.
2182000	2183000	Right.
2183000	2185000	Don't forget the riveting tale of
2185000	2187000	lily pad labor dispute, honestly.
2187000	2189000	I'm down for some shingles.
2189000	2190000	Okay.
2192000	2193000	Why is his name erinist?
2193000	2195000	I honestly didn't know.
2195000	2196000	I can't even remember.
2196000	2197000	I hardly remember.
2197000	2199000	I'm here, but I've never opened this game before.
2200000	2201000	What world?
2201000	2203000	I am on world 388.
2205000	2207000	Do mods have pinning?
2207000	2208000	Can mods pin?
2208000	2210000	World 388.
2213000	2215000	Free questing.
2217000	2219000	I might work some unable to participate,
2219000	2220000	but have fun, Strony reflings.

2223000	2224000	I don't think mods can pin.
2224000	2225000	Okay.
2225000	2226000	Can I pin?
2227000	2228000	Can I pin?
2228000	2229000	Hold on.
2229000	2230000	Ow, don't, don't, don't.

2247000	2249000	Strony, after the bloke completion,
2249000	2251000	what do you think about the bad jokes completion?
2251000	2253000	Honestly, we should.
2253000	2255000	Wish us to treat.
2255000	2256000	I'll take anything.
2256000	2258000	I've got a crusty sock in my inventory right now.
2258000	2259000	Oh, should I?
2259000	2262000	You're giving me a chef's hat because I want cooking.
2264000	2265000	Yes.

2328000	2329000	Excuse me, iPhone.
2329000	2331000	I'm here to do something.
2331000	2332000	Right.

2336000	2338000	Oh, oh, here it is.
2338000	2341000	I'll read it out for you as for those of you that are blind.
2341000	2343000	Cook's assistant.
2343000	2346000	I can start this quest by talking to the Cook Lumberge Castle.
2346000	2348000	Difficulty novice.

2350000	2351000	Jeez.
2351000	2353000	Storyline.
2353000	2354000	Stand alone.
2354000	2356000	No requirements and no none.
2357000	2359000	Wait, someone else wishes to trade.
2359000	2361000	I don't, you guys can't give me like main stuff.
2361000	2362000	I am.
2362000	2364000	I'm going to head to bed early.
2364000	2366000	And I'll use the stream as a sleep bed.
2366000	2367000	I hope I don't wake you.
2367000	2368000	No way.
2368000	2369000	I've got a penny.
2370000	2371000	No.
2371000	2372000	I have a penny as well.
2372000	2373000	Oh my God.
2373000	2374000	Wait.
2374000	2375000	Sorry.

2382000	2383000	Thank you for the penny.
2383000	2385000	Thank you for the chess hat.
2385000	2388000	If you want to gift you games, how do we do that?
2388000	2389000	You don't.
2389000	2392000	I buy them with my hard earned cash.
2392000	2394000	Cold hard cash.
2394000	2395000	Right.
2395000	2396000	Let's go.
2396000	2397000	Cooks assistant.
2397000	2399000	I'll turn off running.
2399000	2400000	We'll just walk.
2400000	2401000	Right.

2405000	2406000	Come reflings.
2406000	2407000	You can follow me if you want.
2407000	2408000	Wait.
2408000	2409000	Who are we fighting?
2409000	2410000	Why are you fighting that per man?
2410000	2411000	Right.
2411000	2412000	Oh my God.
2412000	2413000	Women's simulator.
2413000	2414000	Time to head to the kitchen.
2414000	2415000	Oh my God.
2415000	2416000	There's so many.
2416000	2417000	Right.
2417000	2424000	This cook is like, why are all you people in my kitchen right now?
2424000	2425000	Right.
2425000	2426000	Yes.
2426000	2427000	Cook.
2427000	2429000	What's wrong, Mr. Cook?
2429000	2430000	Oh dear.
2430000	2431000	Oh dear.
2431000	2432000	Oh dear.
2432000	2434000	I'm in terrible trouble with mess.
2434000	2439000	It's the Duke's birthday today and I should be making him a big, lovely birthday cake.
2439000	2441000	I've forgotten to buy the ingredients.
2441000	2442000	I'll never get them now.
2442000	2443000	He'll sack me.
2443000	2444000	What will I do?
2444000	2446000	I have four children and I go look after.
2446000	2447000	Honestly.
2447000	2448000	Me with the...
2448000	2449000	What?
2449000	2450000	What?
2450000	2453000	I have five babies but one of them is a goat.
2453000	2455000	He has four babies and a goat.
2455000	2456000	What are the odds?
2456000	2457000	Yes.
2457000	2458000	We're going to help Cook's assistant.
2458000	2459000	Yes.
2459000	2460000	I'll help you.
2460000	2461000	Oh great.
2461000	2462000	Oh.
2462000	2464000	My little quest helper just popped up.
2464000	2466000	Where do I find these ingredients?
2466000	2471000	I think I remember where they are so I think we can just walk away.
2471000	2473000	Do I need to pick up a pit?
2473000	2474000	I think...
2474000	2475000	Do we need this jug?
2475000	2476000	Wait.
2476000	2478000	Are we all going to be fighting over the same jug?
2478000	2483000	Do we not need a jug for this quest to put the milk in?
2483000	2484000	Save yourself and run.
2484000	2485000	Buy eggs here.
2485000	2486000	100 cold coins.
2486000	2487000	Sell an egg.
2487000	2488000	No.
2488000	2495000	Do we not have to pick up the big egg and the milk from the dairy?

5665000	5672000	Someone did a base remix of Sea Shanty 2 and it's so good, I love it.
5672000	5683000	What's the easiest mission quest that we could do? I'm not sure.
5683000	5688000	Absolute banger. I'm going to rub my...BRB, I'm going to go rub my...
5695000	5703000	Someone said rune no treasure. What are you going to quest for? You're trolling me, that's not quest.
5707000	5712000	Pirate's treasure? I don't know. I'm sure there's this headless quest.
5713000	5719000	The restless ghost, I think that's it. Yeah, the restless ghost. Let's do the restless ghost because I'm pretty sure.
5719000	5724000	Okay, we need...okay, just teleport back to Lumberge.
5724000	5729000	So open up your magic book and you should have a teleport. It should say Lumberge home teleport.
5729000	5733000	You open up your little magic page. I don't know if you can see it over my hair.
5733000	5737000	Oh, my hair's so big. I can hardly see my inventory.
5737000	5742000	But just teleport back to Lummi. We're going to do it. We're going to draw it in the ground.
5742000	5747000	Who put a cow over here? I don't even know how you did that.
5747000	5752000	Yeah, teleport to Lumberge. Open up your magic spell book and it's the very first one.
5752000	5757000	It should be on cooldown because we've been mucking about.
5757000	5761000	Okay, I'll stand here and I'll wait for my lonely thing to come.
5761000	5766000	Oh, no, I know another one. No. Get away. Get away with your stance.
5766000	5771000	Okay. Yes, your hair is big.
5771000	5776000	It is. I'm covering up my queen. My big A3.
5776000	5781000	Oh, no more silly songs. I love the way you say cow. A cow.
5781000	5786000	A cow. How do you say cow? Who? Oh, you can also say a highland cow. That's true.
5786000	5791000	Wishes to trade with you. Hmm, what do you offer me? What do you offer me?
5791000	5796000	Tomato and cheese. Can I cook that?
5796000	5800000	What do I do with a tomato and cheese sandwich? Yeah.
5800000	5806000	Oh, there's the cow again. Absolutely stunning on them.
5806000	5812000	Good food. I'll eat it the next time I get into a bar fight by accident.
5812000	5817000	Okay, hopefully all the reeflings made it to the teleport.
5817000	5822000	That was your first time teleporting. Who is doing a snowball fight?
5822000	5827000	Okay, let me take us to the next question. Pretty sure it's over here.
5827000	5832000	Sorry, I was bumping my desk. Have you heard that? That cow? A literal woman.
5832000	5838000	I think they heal one. That's all I need in a bar fight. One cheeky bit of health.
5838000	5843000	He he he. Right. Oh, no, it's in here. Sorry, it's in the church.
5843000	5847000	I'm sorry, I'm such a fake gamer. It's inside the church. I apologize.
5848000	5853000	Father Eric.
5853000	5857000	Here, Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. I'm seeking a quest.
5857000	5861000	I'm looking for a quest. I'm looking for a quest.
5861000	5864000	That's lucky. I need someone to do a quest for me.
5864000	5869000	Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended of time.
5869000	5881000	I'm pretty sure you don't have to fight, so we're going to send it, okay?
5881000	5884000	We're going to send it.
5884000	5887000	Accept the graveyard through the south gate and reach the swamp.
5887000	5892000	I'm sure if you told him that, I sent you. He'd be willing to help.
5892000	5896000	My name is Father Eric, by the way. Please come in, yeah.
5896000	5902000	Blackwax. Take her traveling through the swamps. I've heard like a good thing for us.
5902000	5908000	Okay, the stronger reeflings are literally going to have to pick on the animals that pick on the weaker reeflings, okay?
5908000	5911000	Because I'm going to get picked on as well.
5911000	5916000	I need what? Get a ghost speak amulet.
5916000	5920000	Where though? Fuck.
5920000	5924000	Is that from? In the shack up here?
5924000	5930000	We need to go down to the shack. So let's go through the graveyard.
5930000	5935000	Reeflings together strong. Literally. Why is he Father Ted?
5935000	5943000	No, because all like, all prayer men are like ire's.
5943000	5946000	I've forgotten the name of them. The prayer man.
5946000	5950000	I'm not sure if I want to go through the swamp.
5950000	5956000	I think we might need to go around. Unless we've run through the swamp.
5956000	5962000	I don't know. The music's getting different.
5962000	5969000	I'm just a small weak reefling. Yeah, if anyone gets attacked on the way, you're going to have to like help them out and stuff.
5969000	5975000	I'm getting attacked, basically. Because we're too weak for this. Get with me, swamp.
5975000	5980000	What are you doing? Let my swamp.
5980000	5987000	Oh, a priest. Aye, that's the name. It's a priest prayer man. Completely. I've forgotten that word.
5987000	5994000	The music. And this game's set up.
5994000	5998000	It's not highly included either. Adorable youth.
5998000	6002000	I actually had an extended family member that owned one.
6002000	6009000	And it was like the gentlest giant ever. I never got to meet her. It was like a female Highland cow.
6009000	6013000	God, that's the most Scottish thing I could see. I had a family member that owned a Scottish cow.
6013000	6016000	That Highland cow, which is, you know, Scottish.
6016000	6020000	Father Eric sent me to talk to you. I suppose I'd rather talk to you then.
6020000	6025000	What problems have you got himself into this time? It's got a ghost haunting his graveyard.
6025000	6031000	Oh, that silly fool. I leave town for just five months and you already can't manage.
6031000	6041000	Sorry. Well, I can't go back and exercise it. I vowed not to leave this life until I've done a full two years of prayer and meditation.
6041000	6048000	Two years to sit on your own, bro. Right, we need to go talk to the ghost. We now have an amulet.
6048000	6054000	So we're going to, you'll get given an amulet. Make sure you put it on your person.
6054000	6061000	Okay, make sure you do not waste your sprint weaker leaflings because we need to run away, like, from this fight immediately.
6061000	6066000	Two years without internet? I'd be absolutely losing it. I'm sorry.
6066000	6067000	I'd be. I'd just be...
6067000	6068000	Are you squiddin' me right now?
6068000	6070000	Oh, Brian!
6070000	6076000	Hey, Stroney, if I wanted to share a interesting prompt for you to read, but it was too long for Marshmallow.
6076000	6079000	How would you like me to share it with you?
6080000	6084000	I don't think I'll have any other way.
6084000	6086000	Are all the leaflings coming?
6086000	6090000	Leafling, you're so, you're so behind. I'm going to have to wait for them to spawn on the other one.
6090000	6092000	But I don't want us to get attacked by the big routes.
6092000	6096000	I'm not sure. Thank you for the tip, Anon.
6096000	6098000	If it's big?
6098000	6102000	I think Pastebin is a safe website.
6102000	6106000	Right, let's get the heck out here for these rat scouts.
6106000	6109000	Are the frogs at the swamp?
6109000	6111000	Hey, Stroney. Hi, hi. Thanks for joining.
6111000	6113000	Two years of isolation is wild.
6113000	6119000	Literally, like, I'm sorry, but if I was isolated, I'd just straight up day and night.
6119000	6125000	No stop and say, I'm sorry, but I gotta do something to pass the time.
6125000	6127000	Gotta do something to pass the time, so...
6127000	6131000	I do not know how that brings anyone closer to meditation.
6131000	6132000	Could a Pastebin link work?
6132000	6136000	Yeah, I think Pastebin's probably the only thing.
6136000	6142000	Right, I think we need to be ready to run away, so get ready to turn these running boots on, okay?
6142000	6145000	But talk to the restless ghost.
6145000	6147000	Hello, ghost. How are you?
6147000	6149000	Not very good, actually.
6149000	6151000	What's the problem then?
6151000	6154000	Did you just understand what I said?
6154000	6156000	Yeah, no, tell me what the problem is.
6156000	6158000	Woo, this is incredible.
6158000	6161000	I didn't even expect anyone to ever understand me again.
6161000	6163000	Okay, okay, I can understand you.
6163000	6167000	But do you have any idea why you're doomed to be a ghost?
6167000	6170000	Well, to be honest, I'm not sure.
6170000	6176000	I've been told a certain task may need to be completed, so you can rest in peace.
6176000	6183000	I should think it is probably because a warlock has come along and stolen my skull.
6183000	6186000	If you look inside my coffin, it's no there...
6186000	6189000	A wreathling just closed the coffin as soon as he said that.
6191000	6195000	Okay, okay, he's missing his head. We can see he's missing his head.
6195000	6198000	He clearly needs some head.
6198000	6201000	Oh yeah, that would be such great relief.
6201000	6209000	Okay, return the ghost's skull.
6209000	6211000	Where do we need...
6211000	6213000	What?
6213000	6218000	What? We need to go to the wizard's tower?
6218000	6221000	What the hell?
6221000	6223000	I don't remember that.
6223000	6226000	No way.
6226000	6228000	I don't remember.
6228000	6230000	It's actually quite far away.
6230000	6232000	A wreathling was to show me something.
6232000	6234000	What do you want to show me, wreathling?
6234000	6236000	Other player has accepted.
6236000	6238000	Oh, you're giving me fish to cook?
6238000	6242000	Wait, you're giving me this now?
6242000	6244000	Wait, I think you might need to hold on to it.
6244000	6248000	Because if I die in this quest, you need to hold on to this.
6248000	6251000	Okay, hold on to it. Thank you, but you need to hold on to that.
6251000	6253000	Because if I die, I'm going to drop all of that.
6253000	6259000	We'll do a few more quests and then we're going to actually start levelling up cooking like for real, for real, okay?
6259000	6261000	But thank you so much.
6261000	6266000	But do hold on to that because I'm going to end up perishing.
6266000	6268000	Looks in coffin.
6268000	6270000	So no head.
6270000	6272000	Right, are we all here?
6272000	6273000	I think so.
6273000	6277000	When you guys stack, it's really hard to see like if we're all here.
6277000	6281000	Hey, it's the Praise Gocher!
6281000	6285000	Bro, I feel like I'm getting lured.
6285000	6290000	Do you trust me? Do you trust where we're going?
6290000	6297000	It'd be such a shame if you got lured to me.
6297000	6302000	Oh, someone sent me a marshmallow and they're like, I'm going to be mind broken by you.
6302000	6304000	And I'm like...
6304000	6306000	Soon, soon.
6306000	6309000	Wait, is this not where the mage tower is?
6309000	6313000	Oh no, there's enemies ahead that attack us, okay?
6313000	6315000	Everyone get ready to sprint.
6315000	6318000	There's wizards and robes here that are getting ready to attack us.
6318000	6321000	At these trees up here, there's you trees.
6321000	6324000	Please get ready to run if you're a weaker reefling.
6324000	6326000	We're going to get absolutely wrecked.
6326000	6329000	I'll tell you when to run, okay?
6329000	6332000	But it should be coming up.
6332000	6334000	It should be coming up.
6334000	6336000	Wait, isn't there not you logs here?
6336000	6338000	Am I too late?
6338000	6339000	Eh?
6339000	6343000	Isn't there not you logs here and wizards that beat you up here?
6343000	6345000	I guess I must be misremembering.
6345000	6347000	I'm such a fake landscape gamer.
6347000	6348000	That's Viroc.
6348000	6351000	Oh, should be safe.
6351000	6354000	Meet you guys at the mage bank.
6354000	6356000	Take the bridge.
6356000	6358000	Let's go.
6358000	6359000	We're not...
6359000	6360000	We're north of the...
6360000	6361000	Okay.
6361000	6362000	Everyone's following.
6362000	6363000	Sorry, little reefling.
6363000	6364000	You need to come around.
6364000	6366000	Jump up, jump up, and get down.
6366000	6369000	You shall not pass.
6369000	6371000	Excuse me, pardon me.
6371000	6372000	Come through.
6372000	6373000	Pardon me.
6373000	6375000	Come through.
6375000	6377000	Oh my god.
6377000	6380000	Well fought.
6380000	6381000	Right.
6381000	6383000	Be careful, weaker reeflings.
6383000	6386000	We must run away when we do this, okay?
6386000	6388000	Put your gold on in a minute.
6388000	6389000	Hold on, hold on.
6389000	6392000	Get ready for Friday.
6392000	6394000	Search, alter, and run.
6394000	6397000	Run like your little life depends on it.
6397000	6399000	Run on your retentacles.
6399000	6400000	Search the allers.
6400000	6402000	Search the aller, reeflings.
6402000	6404000	Reeflings scare once he spawns in.
6404000	6406000	Run away, reeflings.
6406000	6408000	Run away, run away, run away.
6408000	6409000	Go up the ladder, weaker ones.
6409000	6411000	Go up the ladder, go up the ladder, go up the ladder.
6411000	6414000	As soon as you get the score, you need to go up the ladder.
6414000	6416000	There's so many reeflings.
6416000	6419000	That skeleton's getting absolutely wrecked.
6419000	6421000	We made it, reeflings.
6421000	6423000	We made it, we're safe.
6423000	6424000	We did it.
6424000	6425000	We didn't get wrecked.
6425000	6428000	I'll wait for you outside the mage castello.
6428000	6430000	We did it today, reeflings.
6430000	6432000	We cheated death.
6432000	6434000	It wasn't a match for us.
6434000	6435000	Yeah.
6435000	6436000	Oh my god.
6436000	6437000	So many of us.
6437000	6439000	The scaly didn't know what hit him, literally.
6439000	6441000	It's closing doors.
6441000	6444000	You've been so mean to the reeflings.
6444000	6447000	Not only are you jacking up prices artificially,
6447000	6449000	but you're closing doors.
6449000	6450000	Oh my god.
6450000	6451000	There's so many of us.
6451000	6454000	Oh, he's beating up that wizard.
6454000	6456000	Oh, shadow wizard money gang.
6456000	6459000	They love casting spells.
6459000	6463000	Death by dark wizard is a rinscape right of passage.
6463000	6466000	Honestly though, no troll under the bridge.
6466000	6467000	Yeah.
6467000	6468000	It's normal.
6468000	6469000	Is that all my reeflings?
6469000	6470000	Did we all make it?
6470000	6474000	Hopefully no one perished.
6474000	6475000	Sailing head.
6475000	6476000	What?
6476000	6481000	That's a good girl's trying.
6481000	6483000	You thought.
6483000	6484000	You thought.
6484000	6486000	Ain't that kind of stream?
6486000	6488000	Ain't that kind of stream?
6488000	6489000	I think if I'm feeling better,
6489000	6490000	maybe the ASMR stream,
6490000	6493000	I give permission for you to give it a try.
6493000	6494000	Right.
6494000	6495000	Okay, reeflings.
6495000	6500000	All the way back to the ghost.
6500000	6503000	Oh, unless, wait, follow the rabbit.
6503000	6504000	Follow the rabbit.
6504000	6507000	The rabbit will take us to where we need to go.
6507000	6509000	Honestly, that rabbit outfit, not going to lie.
6509000	6510000	I'm digging it.
6510000	6512000	I'm actually digging that rabbit.
6512000	6514000	Like, I mean, you can see the hips definition.
6514000	6519000	You can see the yiddies.
6519000	6522000	It's all looking pretty good.
6522000	6524000	And then headless refilling.
6524000	6525000	You're at my render distance.
6525000	6527000	Whoever's back there had this refilling.
6527000	6530000	Look at the size of them grippers.
6530000	6531000	Oh, we're up.
6531000	6532000	What is that?
6532000	6535000	Someone's got like a thing on their back.
6535000	6539000	I honestly didn't know how many cosmetics there was in the game.
6539000	6541000	If you get us beaten up by baddies,
6541000	6543000	because you've taken this path.
6543000	6546000	Okay, I think we're safe.
6546000	6548000	Reefling just hovering in the background.
6548000	6551000	Hey, it's constantly coming in and out of render distance.
6551000	6556000	Okay, hydration check.
6556000	6561000	I hope this taxi is better than the last.
6561000	6562000	Oh, wow.
6562000	6564000	Oh, no.
6564000	6565000	Rad attack.
6565000	6570000	Walking us to the Edgeville dungeon.
6570000	6572000	Wait, there is a place called Edgeville.
6572000	6575000	Oh my gosh, that's where we should make the home.
6575000	6579000	Oh, I was going to play hide and seek.
6579000	6582000	And if I touch you, then you're out.
6582000	6584000	Right, where do we need to go?
6584000	6590000	Oh, we need to go to the graveyard, guys.
6590000	6595000	Yeah, there's literally a place called Edgeville in this game.
6595000	6597000	There's a plugin for hide and seek.
6597000	6599000	Is there actually?
6599000	6600000	That's so smart.
6600000	6605000	Maybe next stream I'll get the plugin and we'll see how it works.
6605000	6606000	I don't know.
6606000	6607000	Hide and seek.
6607000	6608000	I'd rather lose.
6608000	6611000	But every time I find you, all you hear is plop, plop, plop.
6611000	6613000	And then move on to the next refund.
6613000	6615000	Plop, plop, plop.
6615000	6616000	It's over.
6616000	6617000	Okay.
6617000	6619000	We need to put the hedge on the coffin.
6619000	6620000	And all is good.
6620000	6624000	We're going to use the skull on the coffin.
6624000	6627000	Use it on the coffin.
6627000	6629000	It's not a...
6629000	6631000	Oh, cut scene.
6631000	6632000	Release.
6632000	6635000	Thank you, stranger.
6637000	6638000	Yeah.
6638000	6639000	Oh, he's away.
6639000	6641000	Oh, he's in the water.
6641000	6642000	Oh, he's had enough.
6642000	6643000	He's in the water.
6643000	6646000	Whoa, we got one cave prayer for that.
6646000	6647000	That was actually pretty big.
6647000	6650000	Right, we've got four quest points now.
6650000	6653000	Jeez, we've got nine prayers.
6653000	6654000	What?
6654000	6657000	And I'm level four combat currently.
6657000	6659000	I didn't fight anything, though.
6659000	6660000	Hide and plop.
6660000	6662000	Yes, hide and plop.
6662000	6664000	I want to find hide and plop.
6664000	6665000	Good.
6665000	6666000	Release.
6666000	6668000	Oh, that's a lot.
6668000	6671000	Everyone's leveling up.
6671000	6674000	Rep sleeping viewers.
6674000	6675000	Yeah, sorry.
6675000	6678000	Hopefully no one actually uses this to sleep, too.
6678000	6682000	I wonder if there's also a kumbor.
6682000	6685000	Right, what's the easiest quest next?
6685000	6687000	Or are we actually going to have to level up?
6687000	6693000	I think we might have to get stronger because everything's like...
6693000	6696000	Maybe Goblin Village?
6696000	6699000	If we buy everything in advance for that Goblin quest,
6699000	6701000	I forgot the name of it.
6701000	6704000	Romeo and Juliet is good.
6704000	6706000	Should we try Romeo and Juliet?
6706000	6709000	Romeo and Juliet.
6709000	6713000	Also an amulet that's useful for the future, right?
6713000	6716000	Stronghold of security time?
6716000	6717000	I've never done that one.
6717000	6720000	Romeo and Juliet is no needed stats.
6720000	6722000	Okay, we're going to do that one then.
6722000	6726000	I can start this quest by talking to Romeo and Varrock Square.
6726000	6728000	Who the heck?
6728000	6730000	Oh, that's a big walk.
6730000	6731000	Not going to lie.
6731000	6733000	That's like really far away.
6733000	6735000	Not going to lie.
6735000	6738000	Okay, we cross the bridge,
6738000	6742000	and then we just keep going all the way up to Varrock.
6742000	6745000	I've already lost where Romeo is.
6745000	6747000	Oh, he's literally in the square of Varrock.
6747000	6748000	Well, we don't have teleport stone,
6748000	6751000	so we're going to have to do it the old fashioned way.
6752000	6759000	I heard it drops the goal in the amulet.
6759000	6760000	I don't know what that is.
6760000	6762000	Follow, someone says follow.
6762000	6764000	Just...
6764000	6766000	Oh, oh, taxi!
6766000	6770000	Okay, follow the guy with the magma cape.
6770000	6772000	Wait, make sure we get out of the graveyard first
6772000	6774000	because we might actually get stuck on the gravestones.
6774000	6775000	Yeah, you'll get...
6775000	6778000	Careful, you'll get stuck on the gravestones.
6779000	6783000	Okay, if you're going to tax sales,
6783000	6785000	can I make a cup of tea?
6785000	6787000	Am I allowed to make a cup of tea?
6787000	6789000	That little voice is getting sore.
6789000	6792000	This is a magma cape, winky.
6792000	6793000	It is!
6793000	6795000	Isn't that a magma cape?
6795000	6797000	Whoa, what is that?
6797000	6800000	Wait, you got a special accolade?
6800000	6804000	Is that a special accolade to this thing?
6804000	6806000	Oh, it's a fire cape.
6806000	6809000	I mean, it looks like magma lava,
6809000	6812000	so whoever named it is wrong.
6812000	6814000	We...
6814000	6817000	We must go directly into the dark mages.
6817000	6819000	Oh, wait, I can't make a cup of tea
6819000	6821000	because I'm going to get hurt by the mages.
6821000	6823000	For the weaker reeflings,
6823000	6826000	we're about to pass some wizards
6826000	6829000	outside of a rock that will attack us.
6829000	6832000	We need to be ready to run.
6832000	6834000	Go west near the farm.
6834000	6836000	Oh, he says he's going to go around.
6836000	6839000	I think we have enough people to kill the dark wizards.
6839000	6842000	Oh, can I go quickly make a cup of tea, then?
6844000	6847000	Watching strongy stream?
6847000	6851000	Whenever I read the last thingy,
6851000	6852000	you know the love heart?
6852000	6854000	You can put a love heart on stream.
6854000	6857000	Tap that love heart thing.
6857000	6860000	It's in the way if I read the most bottom thing.
6860000	6862000	It says, watching strongy stream is the type of accolade.
6862000	6864000	Yeah, if you tap that heart,
6864000	6865000	I can see when you tap it,
6865000	6868000	but it blocks the last message.
6868000	6871000	I'll be doing nothing but laughing if anyone dies.
6871000	6873000	Oh, we'll also be at the bank,
6873000	6876000	so is that reefling still there to trade the fish?
6876000	6877000	Plenty more fish.
6877000	6878000	I can only see it on mobile.
6878000	6882000	Yeah, I can see someone make a flush face smiley reaction.
6882000	6884000	It's in the way for everyone.
6884000	6885000	Okay, right.
6885000	6886000	I was going to say, because it's in the way.
6886000	6888000	Whenever I read the most bottom message,
6888000	6889000	it's in the way.
6889000	6892000	That cape requires you to kill a level 700 monster.
6892000	6895000	Unless you guys can carry me through that monster,
6895000	6896000	I don't think we can do that.
6896000	6898000	I've never done it before.
6898000	6900000	Yeah, I had to nuke the heart with an edlocker.
6900000	6902000	I think you can toggle it away.
6902000	6904000	Yeah, I have to scroll around it.
6904000	6906000	It's a solo fight?
6906000	6908000	Well, I'm never getting that.
6908000	6912000	I am here with the fish.
6912000	6915000	Okay, we will be going next to the bank,
6915000	6918000	so we should be okay.
6918000	6919000	I think.
6919000	6920000	Is there any?
6920000	6921000	Hopefully, there's not too many.
6921000	6922000	Oh, yeah.
6922000	6925000	Good idea to go to the bushes first.
6925000	6926000	Oh, no, these reeflings.
6926000	6931000	Oh, no, don't get stuck on the wall, reefling.
6931000	6932000	These are reeflings.
6932000	6933000	Oh, no, I don't know if that's everything.
6933000	6935000	I might just be someone.
6935000	6937000	There's three dots at the top of chat.
6937000	6938000	No, no, I think it's okay.
6938000	6941000	I think it's there.
6941000	6943000	Fire cape would be fun.
6943000	6945000	Oh, no, I don't even know how to do that.
6945000	6948000	I don't even know how prayer pots work in, like,
6948000	6951000	strength potions and all of that work,
6951000	6952000	and it's, like, all temporary,
6952000	6959000	but they're, like, a thousand, and it's so expensive.
6959000	6960000	Watch out now.
6960000	6962000	All right, weaker reeflings.
6962000	6963000	Get ready.
6963000	6965000	Get ready, weaker reeflings.
6965000	6966000	Stronger reeflings.
6966000	6967000	Beat them up.
6967000	6968000	Show those wizards.
6968000	6969000	We mean freaking...
6969000	6971000	We mean business.
6971000	6973000	Beat them up, stronger reeflings.
6973000	6974000	We'll be...
6974000	6976000	The weaker reeflings are going to stick together.
6976000	6980000	This is the best we can do under the circumstances.
6980000	6983000	Cut off, Boudin.
6983000	6985000	Run into the circle reefling.
6985000	6987000	No, do not go in that circle.
6987000	6988000	These wizards are stinky.
6988000	6989000	They're no good, guys.
6989000	6991000	He's telling you fevers.
6991000	6993000	He's telling you the Fibonacci sequence,
6993000	6995000	because those are fevers.
6995000	6997000	Okay, I think the reeflings, like,
6997000	7000000	literally eradicate all the wizards for us in a way.
7000000	7001000	Thank you.
7001000	7002000	They're all dead.
7002000	7005000	Literally just absolutely eradicated them.
7005000	7008000	I think the funniest thing ever.
7008000	7009000	Wow.
7009000	7011000	How can I tell?
7011000	7013000	Whoa, how many quests is there?
7013000	7017000	I don't know if we can do all the quests in just a little while.
7017000	7021000	Right, we're looking for R for Romeo.
7021000	7023000	Uh-oh.
7023000	7024000	Uh-oh.
7024000	7025000	Uh-oh.
7025000	7026000	Okay.
7026000	7028000	We're here.
7028000	7031000	Right, who's Romeo?
7032000	7034000	Oh, Romeo's inside the shop.
7034000	7037000	Inside the shop with the green windows.
7037000	7039000	Inside the shop is where Romeo is.
7039000	7041000	He thought he could hide from us.
7041000	7043000	Right, talk to Romeo.
7043000	7044000	Romeo.
7044000	7045000	What?
7045000	7048000	What is to become of me and my darling Juliet?
7048000	7050000	I cannot find her anywhere.
7050000	7051000	Have you seen her?
7051000	7054000	Yes, I have seen her, actually.
7054000	7056000	At least, I think it was her.
7056000	7057000	Blonde, a bit stressed.
7057000	7059000	Golly, yes, yes.
7059000	7062000	You make a sense of very interesting.
7062000	7067000	And I'll bet she's a bit of a fox around.
7067000	7071000	Well, I guess she could be considered attractive.
7071000	7074000	I'll bet she is.
7074000	7077000	Woo-hoo.
7077000	7083000	Sorry, all that jubilation has made me forget what we were talking about.
7083000	7086000	You were asking me about Juliet.
7086000	7088000	You seem to know her.
7088000	7093000	Oh, yes, Juliet.
7093000	7095000	That fox.
7095000	7098000	Could you tell her that she is the love of my long?
7098000	7099000	What?
7099000	7101000	She is the love of my long?
7101000	7103000	Rinse, jagged.
7103000	7108000	She's the love of my long and that I love to be with her.
7108000	7109000	What?
7109000	7110000	What?
7110000	7114000	Surely you mean she is the love of your life and that you long to be with her?
7114000	7116000	Oh, yes, what you said.
7116000	7118000	Tell her that, it sounds much better.
7118000	7121000	Oh, you're so good at this.
7121000	7123000	Start the Romeo and Juliet quest.
7123000	7126000	Yeah, okay, I'll let her know.
7126000	7132000	Oh, great, and tell her that I want to kiss her a give.
7132000	7135000	You mean you want to give her a kiss?
7135000	7140000	Oh, you are good, you are good.
7140000	7144000	I see I've picked a true professional.
7144000	7146000	Is he drunk?
7146000	7149000	Okay, thanks.
7149000	7150000	Yay!
7150000	7153000	Okay, has everyone got the quest?
7153000	7155000	We now need to...
7155000	7157000	Actually, we're going to very quickly go to the bank
7157000	7161000	and I'm going to young call the fish from your juicy, juicy donations to me.
7161000	7162000	Okay.
7162000	7163000	Oh, wait, sorry, sorry, wait, wait, wait.
7163000	7164000	Pause, pause.
7164000	7165000	I'm in the square, I'm in the square.
7165000	7166000	Sorry, I didn't mean to run away so quickly.
7166000	7168000	We're going to very quickly go to the Grand Exchange
7168000	7170000	because I'm going to empty my inventory
7170000	7173000	and if you want to give me anything, you can, okay?
7173000	7178000	But I'll...
7178000	7180000	Uh, no, don't give me a bond.
7180000	7182000	I've already bought premium, thank you so much.
7182000	7184000	Don't give me a bond though, I bought premium.
7184000	7186000	Right, Reflings, if you want to follow me,
7186000	7189000	we're going to go to the Grand Exchange.
7189000	7194000	So if you want to give me anything, you can.
7194000	7196000	Get your scam messages ready.
7196000	7202000	Oh no, I need to mute public chat whilst we're here.
7202000	7206000	I might need to mute public chat.
7206000	7211000	I don't know how bad the bots are going to be.
7211000	7215000	I have no idea how bad the bots are going to be.
7215000	7221000	I might have to mute public chat until we go away.
7221000	7222000	Buying girlfriend through...
7222000	7224000	Oh, there's like the bots aren't talking.
7224000	7226000	Okay, nothing's happening.
7226000	7227000	Right, I'm going to put...
7227000	7228000	I'm literally...
7228000	7229000	Oh no, no, I don't want to sell them.
7229000	7232000	I'm just literally going to shove everything in the bank.
7232000	7235000	Uh, I think I'll just drop the clue scroll.
7235000	7236000	Ah, you know what?
7236000	7237000	I'll just put it in the bank.
7237000	7238000	It doesn't make a difference.
7238000	7240000	Put all my coins in.
7240000	7241000	I've got an antique lamp.
7241000	7242000	I don't know what that does.
7242000	7244000	Oh, I can't put it away.
7244000	7246000	Uh, I'll rub the antique lamp.
7246000	7247000	Oh!
7247000	7250000	Um, into kicking please.
7250000	7253000	Hey, 300 XP in kicking.
7253000	7254000	Yay!
7254000	7256000	Okay, I'm level 7.
7256000	7258000	Cooking now feels good, man.
7258000	7259000	Stand over here.
7259000	7262000	If you want to trade me, you're more than welcome to.
7262000	7265000	I'm literally starting a farm for, uh...
7265000	7267000	How do I accept, accept?
7267000	7268000	Okay, there we go.
7268000	7269000	Sorry, sorry, I'm dumb.
7269000	7273000	Oh my gosh, that's a lot of fish.
7273000	7275000	Oh, a 10 million?
7275000	7276000	Are you crazy?
7276000	7278000	Isn't that a lot of money?
7278000	7280000	Are you sure?
7280000	7282000	That's a lot of money.
7282000	7284000	Oh wait, did I just accept you as a friend by accident?
7284000	7285000	Whoops.
7286000	7289000	10 million reeflings.
7289000	7293000	Is this account going to get shot down?
7293000	7295000	Because, like, Jagex are going to be like,
7295000	7297000	you're clearly, like, paying for these?
7297000	7298000	I got lobster!
7298000	7299000	I'm cake!
7299000	7300000	Yes!
7300000	7304000	Thank you for the lobster!
7304000	7305000	Oopsie.
7305000	7308000	The weapon is 1.2 billion?
7308000	7309000	That's crazy.
7309000	7314000	Sorry, I think I accidentally added a frame.
7314000	7315000	10 million?
7315000	7318000	Isn't that not, like, a...
7318000	7321000	How much, how much ink?
7321000	7322000	How much ink?
7322000	7325000	1,000 crusty socks?
7325000	7327000	Why did Jagex make that item?
7327000	7329000	They knew exactly what they were doing.
7329000	7331000	Doubling money!
7331000	7334000	This shmuck just made 10 million.
7334000	7338000	Doubling money, doubling money.
7338000	7341000	That's ridiculous.
7341000	7343000	On the contrary, we play here.
7343000	7345000	Oh, it's a ring!
7345000	7347000	Oh, can I wear it?
7347000	7349000	Am I allowed to put it on?
7349000	7351000	It's a diamond reefling!
7351000	7352000	Oh, my God.
7352000	7353000	Wait, wait.
7353000	7356000	Can I see it on my finger if I put it on?
7356000	7359000	No, I didn't change my persons.
7359000	7361000	I'm married to the reeflings.
7361000	7363000	He he he he he.
7363000	7366000	Okay, what do we do on the wedding then?
7366000	7367000	What's the honeymoon?
7367000	7370000	I want to know about the honeymoon.
7370000	7372000	Fishies!
7372000	7375000	Oh, we are going to be, like, exploding.
7375000	7377000	Oh, my God, that's so much.
7377000	7380000	We are going to be exploding once we cook all these.
7380000	7383000	Thank you, reeflings.
7383000	7384000	Oh, my gosh.
7384000	7386000	Okay, I'm going to put it all in the bank,
7386000	7390000	and then we get to come back.
7390000	7392000	Come back.
7392000	7394000	There's not one single bot here.
7394000	7396000	That's pretty thingy.
7396000	7398000	Okay, we are doing Romeo and Juliet.
7398000	7399000	Do we need to do anything?
7399000	7401000	We actually don't need any items at all.
7401000	7402000	Wow.
7402000	7403000	Oh, sorry.
7403000	7405000	Sorry, there's a few more that wish to trade.
7405000	7406000	My apologies.
7406000	7407000	My apologies.
7407000	7409000	Fishies!
7409000	7411000	Look at all the fishies.
7411000	7413000	You can bank note these, by the way.
7413000	7415000	But thank you for the fishies.
7415000	7418000	We're getting so much fish.
7418000	7420000	Yes, thank you.
7420000	7423000	Okay, how do I accept this?
7425000	7428000	Oh, I'm getting grapes.
7428000	7430000	Hey, yo, you want to grape me?
7430000	7432000	Hold on a minute.
7432000	7433000	Oh, no, sorry.
7433000	7434000	The cut of our berries.
7434000	7435000	My apologies.
7435000	7436000	My apologies.
7436000	7440000	It's a wedding gift.
7440000	7442000	Who did I not accept the trade from?
7442000	7443000	Is it you?
7443000	7445000	Did I accept the trade from you?
7445000	7446000	God, great.
7446000	7449000	Wait, does Johnny come in tax fraud and runescape?
7449000	7450000	Honestly?
7450000	7451000	Oopsie, sorry.
7451000	7452000	Oh, wait, hold on.
7452000	7454000	I accidentally added a reefling.
7454000	7455000	I apologize.
7455000	7456000	Sorry.
7456000	7458000	It's just because it was show.
7458000	7460000	What's the dress going to look like?
7460000	7462000	Someone called Sweaty Socks.
7462000	7464000	Are you role-playing as my Sweaty Socks?
7464000	7466000	I actually have socks on.
7466000	7467000	Oh, it's a necklace.
7467000	7469000	It's so pretty.
7469000	7472000	Oh, they get to put it on.
7474000	7476000	Amulet of power.
7476000	7478000	Oh, check me out.
7478000	7480000	Oh, look at that little thing.
7480000	7482000	This puppet that you get to hurry.
7484000	7486000	When we celebrate in the wedding
7486000	7489000	on my alternative Twitter.
7489000	7491000	Eat cuttlefish.
7491000	7493000	Whatever, you name yourself like that.
7493000	7496000	Unless you mean the other way.
7496000	7498000	What, you got to show me what you've got?
7498000	7500000	Eat cuttlefish.
7504000	7505000	You know what?
7505000	7507000	Are you just going to...
7507000	7510000	Hi, Johnny, sounding beautiful as ever.
7510000	7511000	Are you declined it?
7511000	7514000	Right, I will put this away in the bank.
7514000	7516000	And then we will finish
7516000	7518000	Gnotic and Elf and Gnotic and Oblin.
7518000	7520000	Wait, why is that not doing all...
7520000	7521000	There we go.
7521000	7523000	Oh, that's all I needed to do.
7524000	7526000	Speaking of alt-Twitters.
7526000	7529000	What was your reaction to them blown up?
7529000	7532000	So, Mercy stumbled upon the algorithm.
7532000	7534000	And then Sheebie did it.
7534000	7536000	But I did mine too late, Rip.
7536000	7539000	But, I mean, the video did really well.
7539000	7541000	It got like a hundred and...
7541000	7543000	A thousand likes on it.
7543000	7544000	And you're really good.
7544000	7546000	Wait, are you trying again?
7546000	7547000	Did you get stage fright?
7547000	7548000	Or is that the other one?
7548000	7550000	Ah, okay, okay, okay.
7550000	7553000	Right, Gnome, Gnotic and Elf and Gnotic and Oblin.
7553000	7556000	We need to Gnotic and Elf to over to Gnor.
7556000	7559000	To Faldor, I think.
7559000	7561000	I think she's somewhere here.
7561000	7563000	I don't know where she is.
7563000	7565000	Talk to Romeo, I did.
7567000	7569000	Did I not accept?
7569000	7571000	Talk to Romeo, I did.
7571000	7573000	Talk to Juliet in the house west of Viroc.
7573000	7575000	Oh wait, they're both in Viroc?
7575000	7578000	Why did I think she was in Faldor?
7579000	7582000	And where is Gnotic and Oblin?
7585000	7587000	I'm analising.
7587000	7589000	I'm analising.
7589000	7591000	Oh!
7591000	7592000	Eh?
7592000	7593000	She's here?
7593000	7595000	Why would you be in there?
7596000	7597000	Okay.
7597000	7600000	Alright, let's go to the front of the Grand Exchange
7600000	7602000	for my little refillings, front of the Grand Exchange,
7602000	7603000	front centre.
7603000	7605000	After this quest, I am going to...
7606000	7607000	Faldor?
7607000	7609000	I hardly even know her.
7611000	7612000	Thank you, thank you.
7612000	7614000	I came up with that myself, thank you.
7616000	7618000	Refillings, I'm at the front of the Grand Exchange.
7618000	7619000	You can find me over here.
7619000	7621000	So we're making a clan.
7621000	7622000	Can you make a clan?
7622000	7624000	Like, can anyone make a clan?
7627000	7628000	That video was amazing.
7631000	7634000	All per eco fish just wanted to feel included in it.
7634000	7636000	It got none to thingy.
7636000	7638000	A luring clan, he even knows.
7638000	7640000	Okay, is this all my refillings?
7640000	7641000	We're at the front?
7641000	7642000	Okay, this looks like great.
7642000	7643000	Ready?
7643000	7644000	Atten!
7644000	7645000	Up!
7645000	7647000	Two, three, four.
7647000	7648000	Up!
7648000	7649000	Two, three, four.
7649000	7650000	How do I get in this house?
7650000	7651000	It looks like I get in this door here.
7651000	7653000	Unless there's another door.
7653000	7654000	No, there's a door here.
7654000	7656000	Okay, we just used this door.
7656000	7657000	Literally right over there.
7657000	7658000	Hut!
7658000	7659000	Two, three, four.
7659000	7660000	Hit!
7660000	7661000	Two, three, four.
7661000	7663000	Mine is too bad joke, literally.
7663000	7665000	Just going down ten aura, sorry.
7670000	7671000	Okay, open the door.
7671000	7674000	Hello, we would like to come inside your house.
7674000	7675000	Don't mind us, we're just...
7675000	7678000	How have I come the hardest way to get around this house?
7678000	7679000	There's no way!
7679000	7681000	I literally picked the most awkward door.
7681000	7683000	I'm so sorry!
7683000	7688000	We literally have trailed through the entire house, but the one door.
7688000	7690000	Stop pranking each other with the door!
7690000	7692000	You're pranking me with the door!
7692000	7694000	Why is there a fisherman?
7694000	7696000	It's a true draw party!
7696000	7698000	Get your truck, get your truck, get your truck.
7698000	7699000	We're going to need it.
7699000	7701000	We're going to need all the XP.
7701000	7704000	I got three, four, five, six.
7704000	7707000	I don't know how I managed to do the worst.
7707000	7708000	Right, go up the stairs.
7708000	7709000	Up the stairs.
7709000	7710000	It smells fishy in here.
7710000	7711000	It does.
7711000	7712000	Right, where's Juliet?
7712000	7714000	Oh, her room's all pink.
7714000	7716000	Oh my God, you're such a girl.
7716000	7717000	How do we know Juliet's a girl?
7717000	7719000	Hmm, it's a mystery.
7719000	7721000	Hi Juliet.
7721000	7723000	Juliet, I've come from Romeo.
7723000	7726000	He begs me to tell you that he cares still.
7726000	7729000	Oh how my heart soars for hearing this news.
7729000	7732000	Please take this message to him with great haste.
7732000	7734000	Well, I hope it's good news.
7734000	7736000	He was quite upset when I left him.
7736000	7741000	He's quite often upset at the poor sensitive soul,
7741000	7744000	but I don't think he's going to take this news very well.
7744000	7746000	However, all is not lost.
7746000	7748000	Everything is explained in the letter.
7748000	7752000	Would you be so kind to deliver it to him, please?
7752000	7755000	Certainly, I'll do so straight away.
7755000	7756000	Many thanks.
7756000	7758000	Oh, I'm so very grateful.
7758000	7760000	You may be our only hope.
7760000	7762000	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
7762000	7763000	You're my only hope.
7763000	7766000	Okay, as everyone spoke to Juliet,
7766000	7768000	Romeo and Juliet, we're just literally passing
7768000	7770000	sextant messages, honestly.
7770000	7771000	What's going on here?
7771000	7774000	If you have spoken to Juliet,
7774000	7776000	we can go back doing the stairs,
7776000	7778000	and we're going to go back to Romeo.
7778000	7781000	Oh, Romeo, where are for thou art Romeo?
7781000	7783000	Oi, who closed that door?
7783000	7785000	I literally just smacked my face.
7785000	7788000	My, I freaking, you closed that door,
7788000	7790000	and now I'm tracking outside backwards.
7790000	7791000	Stop it.
7791000	7792000	Don't, don't close the door.
7792000	7794000	You made me whack my face into it.
7794000	7795000	Stop it.
7795000	7797000	Let me out of this house.
7797000	7799000	It keeps trying to make me go.
7799000	7800000	Right, I'm out.
7800000	7801000	I'm out.
7801000	7802000	Okay, we're safe.
7802000	7803000	We're safe.
7803000	7807000	You don't want to go through the five doors instead, honestly.
7807000	7809000	Forget doing agility training.
7809000	7810000	It's hard enough to get out of a door
7810000	7812000	that someone else is closing.
7812000	7813000	What?
7813000	7814000	How did that pop up?
7814000	7817000	I didn't even accept.
7817000	7819000	Okay, our all reflings here.
7819000	7820000	We're going to go back to Romeo.
7820000	7821000	He's this way.
7821000	7823000	Hardest boss in the game, pathing.
7823000	7824000	Yeah.
7825000	7827000	Are we refling back there?
7830000	7833000	Dear Mario, please come to the castle.
7833000	7836000	Oh, did I tell you I really like this meme?
7836000	7838000	Dear Mario, please don't come to the castle.
7838000	7839000	I've baked a cake.
7839000	7840000	It's absolutely dark shit.
7840000	7843000	I love that meme so much.
7843000	7846000	Okay, we go talk to Romeo back in the green shop.
7846000	7848000	Why is that green?
7848000	7849000	Oh, cloth right.
7851000	7853000	Which one did that?
7853000	7854000	Stop.
7854000	7855000	Stop it.
7855000	7856000	Stop.
7856000	7857000	Right, I'm in.
7857000	7858000	Who did that?
7858000	7859000	Was that you?
7859000	7860000	Was that you?
7860000	7861000	You're the one who's right behind the door.
7861000	7862000	I love Mummy.
7862000	7864000	Am I accusing you live?
7864000	7865000	Was that you?
7865000	7867000	I don't know who did that.
7867000	7869000	I don't know who did that.
7869000	7870000	Talk to Romeo.
7870000	7872000	Romeo, great news.
7872000	7873000	I've been in touch with Big Juliet.
7873000	7875000	She's written a message for you.
7875000	7877000	You hand over the message.
7877000	7878000	Oh, a message.
7878000	7879000	A message.
7879000	7881000	I've never had a message before.
7881000	7882000	Really?
7883000	7885000	No, no, no.
7885000	7886000	Not one.
7887000	7889000	Well, except for the occasional court summon.
7890000	7892000	But the really, really nice message.
7892000	7893000	Not like this one.
7893000	7895000	I'm sure this message will be lovely.
7895000	7896000	Yes, yes.
7896000	7897000	Where are you?
7897000	7899000	Well, are you going to open it or not?
7900000	7901000	Oh, yes.
7901000	7902000	Yes, of course.
7902000	7903000	Yes, of course.
7912000	7913000	Affection.
7913000	7914000	She thinks I'm deceased.
7914000	7915000	Oh, affliction.
7915000	7916000	Oh, I can't read.
7916000	7917000	Sorry.
7917000	7918000	I'm not going to get my glasses on.
7918000	7919000	Sorry.
7919000	7920000	It says affliction.
7920000	7921000	Affection.
7921000	7922000	Oh, wait.
7922000	7923000	No, I got it right.
7923000	7924000	Affection.
7925000	7926000	Oh, yes.
7926000	7928000	Still hold affection for me.
7928000	7930000	I still feel great affection for you.
7930000	7933000	Unfortunately, my father opposes our marriage.
7933000	7934000	Oh, dear.
7934000	7936000	That doesn't sound too good at all.
7937000	7940000	I want great affection for you.
7940000	7943000	Father opposes our marriage.
7943000	7948000	And well, we'll kill you if he sees you again.
7948000	7950000	I'm going to be honest.
7950000	7952000	It's not getting any better, me.
7953000	7957000	Our only hope is that the father Lawrence, a long time confidant,
7957000	7959000	can help us in some way.
7959000	7961000	Romeo folds the message away.
7961000	7963000	Well, that's it then.
7963000	7966000	We haven't got a chance.
7966000	7969000	What about Father Lawrence?
7969000	7975000	Our love is over the great romance that'll life of my love.
7975000	7979000	Or you could speak to Father Lawrence.
7979000	7982000	Oh, my aching, breaking heart.
7982000	7985000	Oh, how useless the situation is now.
7985000	7987000	I've got no one to turn to.
7987000	7990000	Father Lawrence.
7991000	7993000	Father Lawrence.
7993000	7996000	Oh, yes, Father Lawrence.
7996000	7998000	He's a long time confidant.
7998000	7999000	He might have a solution.
7999000	8000000	Yes, yes.
8000000	8002000	You have to go and talk to Father Lawrence for once
8002000	8005000	and ask him if he's got any suggestion for a predicament.
8005000	8008000	Where can I feign Father Lawrence?
8008000	8011000	Lawrence, Father Lawrence.
8011000	8016000	Oh, you know, he's not my real father, don't you?
8017000	8020000	I think I suspected that he wasn't.
8020000	8022000	Did he get hit on the head?
8022000	8026000	Well, anyway, he tells his songs,
8026000	8032000	luring bare moans and keep these here.
8032000	8034000	What? I can't even read that.
8034000	8036000	Yeah, okay, thanks.
8036000	8037000	Okay, thanks.
8037000	8039000	Yeah, thanks mate.
8039000	8041000	Nice try on the English, but even I can't read that.
8041000	8043000	Where the heck are we going? Somewhere over here.
8043000	8046000	He's just a, and then dot, dot, dot.
8046000	8049000	I don't know what you typed, Reefling.
8049000	8052000	Are you trying to say he's one of us?
8052000	8055000	For that word, he's one of us.
8055000	8057000	No one slammed the door.
8057000	8058000	I slammed my piece.
8058000	8060000	Okay, Reeflings, we're going a little to the left
8060000	8062000	outside that shop.
8062000	8063000	Any Reeflings left behind?
8063000	8064000	There's one Reefling.
8064000	8065000	Yay.
8065000	8067000	I don't think these are all NPCs.
8067000	8068000	I love Reefling there.
8068000	8070000	I didn't close the door, but I'm ready to accept
8070000	8072000	any punishment you do with it.
8072000	8076000	Captain Jack Thornbare.
8076000	8078000	Okay, let's go.
8078000	8080000	We are just following the path.
8080000	8082000	I see the blue marker because of rune light,
8082000	8084000	so we're just following that.
8084000	8085000	But, oh no!
8085000	8087000	Oh no, I'm going to get you strapped on the fence.
8087000	8088000	I'm sorry.
8088000	8090000	I was a bit, I was a bit preemptive.
8090000	8092000	Okay, okay, that was lucky.
8092000	8094000	Easy, take it easy, easy.
8094000	8096000	Let's not get any Reeflings caught on a fence.
8096000	8097000	Come on.
8097000	8098000	We can do it.
8098000	8099000	I have no idea how.
8099000	8101000	Oh, here's the church.
8101000	8103000	Right, we're going to go to the steps over here.
8103000	8106000	Rare correct path, I think, honestly.
8106000	8108000	Going to Wildy Ditch.
8108000	8110000	Should we start attacking each other?
8110000	8113000	Should we do fisty cuffs?
8113000	8114000	Should we do fisty cuffs in Wildy
8114000	8116000	and just start beating each other up
8116000	8118000	until there's a crowned Reefling at the end?
8118000	8121000	And then I give you a rose as a favour
8121000	8124000	because you're the knight that stood against all Reeflings.
8124000	8127000	And...
8127000	8130000	And lutes are domain, like the way for you.
8130000	8132000	Oh, I was in the middle of a ceremony.
8132000	8134000	But Romeo sent me.
8134000	8137000	But I'm busy delivering in a ceremony to my congregation.
8141000	8142000	Ah, yes.
8142000	8146000	It certainly seems like you have a captive audience.
8146000	8148000	Okay, okay, what do you want?
8148000	8151000	So I can get rid of you and continue with my ceremony.
8151000	8152000	Romeo sent me?
8152000	8154000	He says you've been able to help?
8154000	8155000	Ah, Romeo, yes.
8155000	8158000	A fine land, but he's a wee bit confused.
8158000	8159000	Very confused.
8159000	8162000	Anyway, Romeo wishes to be married to Julia.
8162000	8165000	She must be rescued from her father's control.
8165000	8167000	I agree, and I think I have an idea.
8167000	8169000	A potion to make her dad...
8169000	8171000	Oh, to appear passed away.
8171000	8172000	Dead!
8172000	8174000	Sounds a bit creepy to me, but please continue.
8174000	8177000	The potion will only make Julia yet appear dead.
8177000	8180000	Then she will be taken to the crypt.
8180000	8181000	Crypt!
8181000	8183000	Again, we're getting a bit creepy, mate.
8183000	8185000	You must have some strange hobbies.
8195000	8197000	That's what the berries someone gave me.
8197000	8198000	Apart from...
8198000	8200000	Did that refling want me to be asleep?
8200000	8202000	Or did you want to be asleep?
8210000	8211000	Okay, reflings!
8211000	8212000	Once you have...
8212000	8213000	Why does someone have a...
8213000	8214000	Someone has a prayer on?
8214000	8215000	Don't leave it on.
8215000	8216000	You've got a prayer on.
8216000	8218000	You're going to run out of prayer.
8218000	8221000	Also, someone get fond of the potion!
8221000	8223000	That's terrible.
8223000	8224000	Guys, you're putting your prayer on.
8224000	8225000	You're going to run out of prayer.
8225000	8227000	Literally, I only have nine prayer points.
8227000	8229000	Right, everyone outside the church.
8229000	8230000	Con-
8230000	8231000	Mass is over.
8231000	8233000	Congrats on finishing Mass.
8233000	8235000	You just have a lot of fun.
8235000	8238000	Where are we going?
8238000	8239000	Oh, that's cool.
8239000	8240000	Oh, you can't see because of my hair.
8240000	8242000	All right, you can kind of see it.
8242000	8243000	See how the bar is like...
8243000	8245000	Oh, you're getting close to being finished.
8245000	8246000	That's new.
8246000	8247000	I don't remember that.
8247000	8252000	Where are we heading?
8252000	8254000	Where are we heading?
8254000	8255000	Whoa!
8255000	8256000	Where am I?
8256000	8257000	No?
8257000	8259000	Can I please go back to the surface?
8259000	8260000	Thank you.
8260000	8262000	Where do we need to go?
8267000	8268000	I'm looking...
8268000	8269000	Oh, there is...
8269000	8270000	Still in the same town.
8270000	8271000	Thank goodness.
8271000	8272000	Okay.
8272000	8275000	I'll just follow the HUD for the most part.
8275000	8277000	Oh, you wished to trade with me.
8277000	8278000	I will accept your trade.
8278000	8279000	What do you offer me?
8279000	8280000	What do you offer me?
8280000	8281000	Oh!
8281000	8282000	You've rejected!
8282000	8285000	How dare you!
8285000	8286000	Oh, no.
8286000	8287000	I had to do with a friend.
8287000	8288000	Sorry.
8288000	8290000	I keep freaking adding people as a friend by accident.
8290000	8291000	Oh, wait.
8291000	8292000	Hold on.
8292000	8293000	I need to remove you.
8293000	8294000	I'm dying.
8294000	8295000	Delete.
8295000	8296000	Rip.
8296000	8297000	One tick.
8297000	8298000	Player.
8298000	8299000	Flick.
8299000	8303000	One tick flicking on Romeo and Juliet Quest.
8303000	8305000	True gamers here, honestly.
8305000	8307000	I wish I understood the tick mechanic.
8307000	8310000	I've heard it explained so many times to me.
8310000	8311000	I don't get it.
8311000	8312000	I don't get it.
8312000	8314000	I'm practicing.
8314000	8315000	Literally.
8315000	8324000	Oh, there's like little birds making noises in the game.
8324000	8326000	Is this the actual priestess...
8326000	8327000	Crickets, please.
8327000	8328000	What?
8328000	8329000	You want me to just play?
8329000	8334000	I'll just play crickets right now, even though you asked for it like five minutes ago.
8334000	8338000	Oh, it's this shop.
8338000	8339000	Okay.
8339000	8343000	What are we doing over here?
8343000	8346000	I thought it was only in the day that I remember Scotland.
8346000	8348000	I'm like, I can be out until like 9.
8348000	8349000	It's summer.
8349000	8354000	When it's summer in Scotland, the sun doesn't go away until like 9.
8354000	8355000	It's pretty bright.
8355000	8356000	Oh, no.
8356000	8357000	I'm closing the door.
8357000	8358000	Okay.
8358000	8361000	I thought I was closing the door, but I'm not.
8361000	8362000	Okay.
8362000	8363000	Let's talk.
8363000	8364000	I am apocrity.
8364000	8365000	I broke potions.
8365000	8366000	Do you need anything?
8366000	8367000	Yes.
8367000	8370000	I do need something very specific about Romeo and Juliet.
8370000	8371000	Wait.
8371000	8373000	Wasn't there a movie called Romeo and Juliet?
8373000	8375000	And it was about nose.
8375000	8378000	What do these berries look like?
8378000	8379000	Wait.
8379000	8380000	We need berries.
8380000	8381000	Oh, no.
8381000	8383000	Someone gave me berries.
8383000	8384000	Okay.
8384000	8387000	I guess we will get the berries.
8387000	8392000	Um, to the Grand Exchange Reeflings, we will go obtain some berries.
8392000	8396000	Oh, I can't get out because someone closed the door.
8396000	8397000	I clicked on the map to get out.
8397000	8398000	Someone's closing the door.
8398000	8400000	I can't get out of that room.
8400000	8402000	I'm not stuck in there.
8402000	8403000	Yeah.
8403000	8405000	My hand hurts after a few minutes of it.
8405000	8408000	Oh, you can only last a few minutes now?
8408000	8409000	One handed?
8409000	8410000	Right.
8410000	8412000	Let's go get some berries.
8412000	8413000	Secret berries.
8413000	8416000	I thought it said I didn't need anything.
8416000	8417000	It said recommended items.
8417000	8418000	None.
8418000	8419000	It says bring.
8419000	8421000	You can pick some from the bushes.
8421000	8423000	Oh, we're to pick them from the bushes.
8423000	8424000	I'm sorry.
8424000	8425000	I apologize.
8425000	8427000	Where's the bushes?
8427000	8428000	Bring.
8428000	8429000	Talk.
8429000	8430000	I've just read it.
8430000	8431000	Bring.
8431000	8432000	Nope.
8432000	8434000	I just read where I can pick the bushes.
8434000	8436000	You can pick some bushes southeast of Iraq.
8436000	8437000	Wait.
8437000	8438000	Where am I supposed to go then?
8438000	8439000	What's southeast?
8439000	8440000	Southeast?
8440000	8442000	Like over here?
8442000	8446000	Feels like I can get stabbed in these back alleys.
8446000	8448000	You can pick my dingo, but...
8448000	8450000	Send!
8450000	8453000	We're trying to find a freaking bush.
8453000	8455000	Yeah, done.
8455000	8456000	Yeah, done.
8456000	8460000	I didn't tell you my short caller arrived for our streaming app.
8460000	8464000	Where are the berries?
8464000	8465000	Pass the dark wizard.
8465000	8466000	Okay.
8466000	8471000	Strong reeflings, please go ahead and beat the absolute crap out of those dark wizards.
8471000	8473000	For weaker reeflings, get ready.
8473000	8478000	Prepare thyself.
8478000	8480000	Where are these berries?
8480000	8482000	I'm looking.
8482000	8488000	Oh my god, the reeflings are just absolutely going to town on them.
8488000	8490000	All the magic noises.
8490000	8491000	Oh!
8491000	8492000	Yes!
8492000	8494000	The bushes are ahead.
8494000	8497000	Fragile and weak, please handle me with care.
8497000	8499000	Trying to find strongies bushes then.
8499000	8500000	Right.
8500000	8501000	I'm going to say something.
8501000	8503000	I'm going to say something controversial.
8503000	8511000	I was going to make a here ASMR, like here sounds, but it was rather, rather different.
8511000	8512000	Okay.
8512000	8513000	Right.
8513000	8514000	I've got berries.
8514000	8517000	Everyone, everyone collect your berries off the bushes.
8517000	8520000	Has everyone got a berry?
8521000	8525000	It looks like they're infinite spawn bushes actually, so.
8525000	8528000	Wait, did bots run these berries?
8528000	8533000	Wait, it's cost 400 GP for these berries?
8533000	8536000	Have we just stumbled on a money maker?
8536000	8540000	Here ASMR, not controversial.
8540000	8541000	How would that even work?
8541000	8545000	I would place the microphone at hips level.
8545000	8548000	I've been here for two seconds and you're already getting controversial.
8549000	8550000	I can't.
8550000	8551000	You show up in it.
8551000	8552000	Right.
8552000	8553000	I think everyone's got it.
8553000	8554000	Yeah.
8554000	8557000	These berries are bought and free to play world smothers with your hair.
8557000	8559000	Next winning strat in GG.
8559000	8560000	Okay.
8560000	8562000	Let's go past the wizards again.
8562000	8563000	Stronger leaflings.
8563000	8564000	You know the drill.
8564000	8566000	Has everyone got a berry?
8566000	8567000	400 GP.
8567000	8568000	Oh my God.
8568000	8569000	That's huge.
8569000	8571000	Interest on the 10 million GP.
8571000	8572000	True.
8572000	8573000	True.
8573000	8574000	10 million GP investment.
8574000	8575000	Beat them up.
8575000	8576000	Beat them up.
8576000	8578000	Show them who's boss.
8578000	8581000	Oh, that red bead is worth so much money.
8581000	8583000	Oh, that refling got it.
8583000	8584000	Oh, no.
8584000	8585000	Take this bead.
8585000	8586000	I got it.
8586000	8588000	I got it.
8588000	8589000	Wow.
8589000	8591000	Wizard hats are 1,000 money.
8591000	8593000	Why is it so much money?
8593000	8595000	We should be killing these wizards over and over again.
8595000	8596000	Okay.
8596000	8597000	I'm going to get out of here before we're getting trouble.
8597000	8600000	I don't want the wizards to spawn and start getting us.
8600000	8601000	Stronger leaf, we're doing this one.
8601000	8606000	Can we have a reward that lets us see the stream stingers?
8606000	8607000	Stop.
8607000	8611000	I've literally not even put them on.
8611000	8617000	I just realized I've not even shown you what my stream stingers look like.
8617000	8622000	That's terrible.
8622000	8623000	That's terrible.
8623000	8625000	Literally like, what did reflings look like?
8625000	8626000	And I'm like, what do you mean?
8626000	8629000	I've already shown you what reflings look like in the artwork.
8629000	8630000	We've got stingers either.
8630000	8632000	And I don't even use my loading screen.
8632000	8635000	And I spent like 600 US dollars on it.
8635000	8638000	I'm like, genuinely such a bad vtuber.
8638000	8641000	But I just want to jump in the game.
8641000	8643000	Who did that?
8643000	8644000	Who did that?
8644000	8645000	Who did that?
8645000	8647000	I managed to somehow get past.
8647000	8649000	Alright, Romeo and Juliet.
8649000	8650000	Well done.
8650000	8651000	You have the berries.
8651000	8652000	I do.
8652000	8653000	Okay.
8653000	8655000	Oh, he's apocratizing.
8655000	8658000	He's apocratizing all over the place.
8658000	8659000	I'm going to smack the plan.
8659000	8661000	Bring the potion to Juliet.
8661000	8662000	Okay.
8662000	8664000	I'm going to stand outside and wait for everyone to get out.
8664000	8665000	Because you already know what's going to happen.
8665000	8667000	And you're always going to freaking smack everyone's face.
8667000	8669000	Strongest seat is a moneymaker.
8669000	8671000	Who said that?
8671000	8672000	Oh.
8672000	8677000	Okay, wait until the other reflings are ready.
8677000	8680000	I'm mousin' all over the refling.
8680000	8681000	I'm mousin' all over you.
8681000	8682000	Are you like that?
8682000	8683000	Oh, I got that.
8683000	8686000	Mousin' all over me.
8686000	8688000	I'm just mousin' all over you.
8688000	8690000	Watch out for Viralt Guards.
8690000	8692000	No, Virat.
8692000	8694000	Doubt these potions are illegal.
8694000	8696000	I haven't made any money though.
8696000	8698000	Drink the potion for a funny thing.
8698000	8699000	Oh, I don't want to drink it.
8699000	8702000	I'd have to go get another thing again.
8702000	8708000	Does it make you pass out?
8708000	8710000	Viralt Guards don't get paid enough to care about that.
8710000	8714000	Honestly, $1 million donation reward.
8714000	8716000	Use stream startin' screen once for 10 seconds.
8716000	8718000	Bravo, honestly.
8718000	8722000	It's been $600, $800-ish.
8722000	8726000	Okay, is that one more refling?
8726000	8729000	Oh, we're all level six now or something?
8729000	8732000	Whoa, that's a lot of refling.
8732000	8733000	Well, no, refling.
8733000	8737000	Or are you not done the quest properly?
8737000	8739000	Or is this...
8739000	8742000	You've got a chef's hat on, which makes me think you're a refler.
8742000	8746000	What are the odds that someone just happens to be doing the quest at the same time?
8746000	8748000	When are we going to winter town?
8748000	8751000	I've literally never done any event in RuneScape
8751000	8754000	because I'm just so bad at it and I don't understand.
8754000	8756000	I know that because I had to hunt it down
8756000	8759000	to get a refler shop for the fan art.
8759000	8761000	Oh, watch it mostly shine.
8761000	8763000	I didn't even know stingers were a thing.
8763000	8765000	So everyone got a logo stinger
8765000	8767000	and everyone got an artwork stinger.
8767000	8769000	I need a moment of time.
8769000	8771000	Oh, someone wants to trade.
8771000	8772000	Except your trade.
8772000	8775000	What do you offer me?
8775000	8777000	Ah!
8777000	8779000	Okay.
8779000	8781000	I'll accept.
8781000	8783000	I did say I wanted your ink, okay?
8783000	8784000	I got you.
8784000	8785000	Yeah.
8785000	8789000	Right, we're going to hand over the potion to Julia.
8789000	8791000	Winter tot is where the yarrow...
8791000	8795000	Literally, that's why I'm like winter fell in Skyrim.
8795000	8796000	That's where the yarrow live.
8796000	8798000	Right, we're going to open the door for everyone.
8798000	8800000	Yarrow ballroom.
8800000	8801000	These here.
8801000	8803000	Oh, I'm going to close the door back.
8803000	8806000	Okay, let's get inside the house, please.
8806000	8808000	Get inside the house.
8808000	8810000	Get up the stairs.
8810000	8815000	Anyway, if I catch any refling closing doors...
8815000	8817000	Something bad's going to happen.
8817000	8818000	I don't know.
8818000	8820000	I'm not decided on the punishment yet.
8820000	8822000	Your stream starting soon is very beautiful.
8822000	8824000	Yes, but it's very...
8824000	8826000	As well.
8826000	8827000	Oh, sorry.
8827000	8829000	I have a Kandava potion here.
8829000	8830000	Suggested by Father Lawrence, if you...
8830000	8832000	Oh, wait, that's me.
8832000	8834000	Excuse me, sorry, I don't know where that voice came from.
8834000	8837000	Have a Kandava potion here. Suggested by Father Lawrence.
8837000	8840000	If you drink it, it will make you appear dead.
8840000	8842000	Yes?
8842000	8844000	And when you appear dead,
8844000	8848000	you're still in lifeless corpse will be removed from the crypt.
8848000	8852000	Oh, a cold, dark, creepy crypt.
8852000	8854000	Sounds just peachy.
8854000	8858000	Then Romeo can steal...
8858000	8860000	And...
8860000	8864000	Let's just steal into the crypt and rescue you just as you wake up.
8864000	8868000	And this is a great idea for getting me out of here.
8868000	8870000	To be fair, I can't take all the credit.
8870000	8873000	In fact, it was all Father Lawrence's suggestion.
8873000	8878000	Okay, if this is the best we can do, then hand over that potion.
8878000	8880000	You pass the suspicion potion to Juliet.
8880000	8881000	Wonderful.
8881000	8884000	Wonderful, I just thought Romeo could remember to get me from the crypt.
8884000	8887000	Why do I feel like we're about to bust her out of the crypt?
8887000	8891000	Please go to Romeo and make sure you understand the lie of his...
8891000	8897000	His gormless, love-lorn, soppy ways.
8897000	8899000	He can be a bit dense sometimes and I don't want to wake...
8899000	8901000	And I want to wake up in the crypt on my own.
8901000	8904000	Yeah, we're definitely picking up the crypt.
8904000	8905000	Here it is.
8905000	8906000	Oh, he...
8906000	8908000	Here's Philippine, my cousin, she's in...
8908000	8910000	She's in on the plot too.
8910000	8913000	She's going to make it seem like it's more convincing.
8913000	8915000	Yes, I'm quick.
8915000	8916000	Ah.
8916000	8917000	What's a British boy?
8917000	8918000	He's quick, British, quick.
8918000	8919000	Nick-a-car.
8919000	8921000	Yes, I'm quite an actress.
8921000	8922000	Good luck, dear cousin.
8922000	8924000	Right, bottoms up.
8929000	8931000	Oh, she's Paris.
8931000	8932000	Oh, no.
8932000	8934000	Juliet has died.
8934000	8939000	You may be more believable if you're not smiling when you see it.
8939000	8940000	Oh, yeah.
8940000	8941000	You might be right.
8941000	8942000	Oh, no, no, no.
8942000	8943000	Let's try that again.
8943000	8944000	Try that again.
8944000	8945000	Oh, no.
8945000	8946000	Juliet's dead.
8946000	8949000	I can't do, like, three different accents at one time.
8949000	8953000	Perhaps a bit louder, like, you're upset, you know, that your cousin just died.
8953000	8955000	Right, yeah, okay.
8955000	8956000	Nick-a-car.
8956000	8958000	Okay, I think I'm getting the motivation now.
8958000	8960000	Okay, let's just try this again.
8960000	8961000	Oh, no.
8961000	8962000	Juliet's dead.
8962000	8963000	Oh, no.
8963000	8964000	Oh, no.
8964000	8967000	Juliet, my poor dead cousin.
8967000	8970000	Oh, this was not a lot of screaming.
8970000	8974000	Oh, you cunt, she's dead.
8974000	8976000	Oh, poor Juliet.
8976000	8980000	I made preparations for her body to be blessed with the crypt.
8980000	8981000	This is terrible.
8981000	8985000	I don't know where that came from.
8985000	8986000	Right, okay.
8986000	8987000	Where do we go next?
8987000	8988000	Bring...
8988000	8991000	Talk to Romeo and Varric Square to finish the quest.
8991000	8992000	All right.
8992000	8995000	That man was Cornel Sanders.
8995000	8998000	How am I getting door blocked?
8998000	9001000	How have they not figured out this freaking door block, honestly?
9001000	9002000	Stop!
9002000	9004000	Right, I just went through that door.
9004000	9006000	That's how strong I am.
9006000	9008000	I just went through that door.
9008000	9009000	Okay.
9009000	9011000	Let's go to Romeo.
9011000	9012000	Where everyone...
9012000	9014000	Right, I'll wait outside.
9014000	9019000	Father noticed that a random person handed her a potion and she perished, literally.
9019000	9021000	Oh, no.
9021000	9022000	Juliet.
9022000	9023000	You're dead.
9023000	9024000	No.
9024000	9026000	I say no.
9026000	9028000	Follow the cute face.
9028000	9029000	Any cute fishers?
9029000	9032000	Any cute fishermen coming to hook her?
9032000	9036000	Yee.
9036000	9038000	Quite the hooker.
9038000	9039000	Hey.
9039000	9040000	Yeah.
9040000	9041000	Oh.
9041000	9042000	Yo-ho.
9042000	9044000	I assume everyone got out.
9044000	9045000	Yeah, the door's been left open.
9045000	9048000	That's how I know all the reeflings are available.
9048000	9050000	Oh, there's two doors to this place.
9050000	9052000	Okay, we'll go in this room.
9052000	9057000	Oh, I now understand people are in their angular gear.
9057000	9059000	I saw that.
9059000	9061000	Who's that shadowed guy?
9061000	9062000	I saw that.
9062000	9066000	You literally are making us walk all the way around because you closed that fecking door.
9066000	9067000	I saw that.
9067000	9070000	I literally saw that in 4K.
9070000	9071000	It's you.
9071000	9072000	It's the freaking shadow one.
9072000	9073000	Who's your name?
9073000	9075000	Identify yourself.
9075000	9077000	Bye.
9077000	9083000	More like slamming to a door.
9083000	9084000	Romeo, it's all set.
9084000	9085000	Juliet has dropped the potion.
9085000	9086000	Ah, great.
9086000	9087000	The potion.
9087000	9088000	Great.
9088000	9089000	What potion would that be then?
9089000	9090000	The kind of a potion.
9090000	9092000	You know, the one which will make her appear dead.
9092000	9093000	She's in the crepe.
9093000	9095000	Pop along and clean your true love.
9095000	9096000	But I'm scared.
9096000	9097000	Will you come with me?
9097000	9099000	Yeah, I knew we were going to come with you.
9099000	9100000	Oh, come on.
9100000	9104000	I just saw the entrance when I visited there last.
9104000	9106000	Stranny, you have hooked me.
9106000	9109000	What voice did I give him?
9109000	9111000	Oh, this is pretty scary.
9111000	9113000	I would be quiet.
9113000	9115000	Oh, he's got flowers.
9115000	9117000	Oh my god, cut scene.
9117000	9118000	Look, we're here.
9118000	9122000	Look, Juliet's over there.
9122000	9123000	Oh, there she is.
9123000	9125000	I don't remember doing this quest, honestly.
9125000	9129000	I think I'll confuse it with Goblin Mail one.
9129000	9133000	Go over to her and I'll go wait over here.
9133000	9138000	Okay, then.
9138000	9139000	Yeah, just go.
9139000	9143000	She's fine.
9143000	9146000	Hey, Juliet.
9146000	9147000	Juliet.
9147000	9148000	Oh, dear.
9148000	9151000	You seem to be dead.
9151000	9154000	What voice did I give her?
9154000	9156000	Oh, Romeo.
9156000	9157000	I'm Philippa.
9157000	9158000	Oh, wow.
9158000	9160000	You're a fox.
9160000	9164000	It's a shame about Juliet, but perhaps we can meet up later.
9164000	9166000	Who's Juliet?
9166000	9170000	Wait, what?
9170000	9171000	That's it?
9171000	9173000	What?
9173000	9176000	What?
9176000	9179000	Hello?
9179000	9182000	I didn't wait, so she's actually dead.
9182000	9184000	Did we actually kill her?
9184000	9185000	Oh, no.
9185000	9187000	That's really sad.
9187000	9189000	I actually feel really bad.
9189000	9191000	I don't remember that.
9191000	9194000	Father Lawrence messed it all up.
9194000	9196000	We just poisoned an innocent woman.
9196000	9198000	Wait, we're go check.
9198000	9202000	Wait, we'll go to her house to see if she's there because what?
9202000	9203000	That was a method.
9203000	9210000	Right, we're going back to the house because what?
9210000	9212000	Juliet in shambles, literally.
9212000	9216000	She's selling her stonks.
9216000	9218000	That was crazy.
9218000	9220000	Right, the door's still open.
9220000	9221000	Surely.
9221000	9229000	Surely there will be no shenanigans at this door.
9229000	9231000	She's fine.
9231000	9232000	Is she actually?
9232000	9236000	Let's get inside.
9236000	9238000	Let's inside.
9238000	9239000	Inside.
9239000	9241000	There we go.
9241000	9242000	You got there in the end.
9242000	9243000	You just need a little guidance.
9243000	9246000	I suppose you're quite pleased with yourself now.
9246000	9248000	Wait, why?
9248000	9250000	Juliet?
9250000	9256000	She's literally getting ran through about yourself.
9256000	9257000	What did she say?
9257000	9261000	I sat in that cold crib for ages waiting on Romeo.
9261000	9263000	That useless fool never showed up.
9263000	9265000	And all I got was indigestion.
9265000	9266000	I'm done with men like him.
9266000	9269000	Now go away before I call my father.
9269000	9271000	Oh, can I play piano?
9271000	9273000	Oh, I wish you could play piano.
9273000	9275000	That'd be kind of cool though.
9275000	9276000	That's so bad.
9276000	9279000	Wait, why can't I go through that door?
9279000	9281000	That's actually really sad.
9281000	9282000	I feel kind of bad though.
9282000	9283000	Sorry, Juliet.
9283000	9284000	We didn't mean that.
9284000	9285000	I'm sorry.
9285000	9286000	Stop!
9286000	9288000	I'm getting locked in again.
9288000	9291000	Actually getting soft locked in my video game.
9291000	9295000	Okay, I am going to make a cup of tea and call a pee break.
9295000	9296000	And then we're...
9296000	9300000	Are we got enough level, like enough skill level now that anyone can like trade?
9300000	9303000	Is nine quest points enough?
9303000	9307000	I think we were going to do some quick fissure.
9307000	9308000	Fissure on.
9308000	9309000	Pee break, finally.
9309000	9311000	Let's just name a preview.
9311000	9313000	All of yous have been needing a pee for ages.
9313000	9314000	A wee break.
9314000	9315000	A piddle break, if you will.
9315000	9317000	Oh my god.
9317000	9321000	Yeah, what do you want to give me?
9321000	9324000	Oh, a beer and a kebab.
9324000	9326000	Are you asking for a drunk stream soon?
9326000	9327000	Because don't think I won't do that.
9327000	9329000	Don't think I won't give the people what they want.
9329000	9331000	Thank you very much.
9331000	9332000	Okay.
9332000	9340000	Oh wait, is that going to log me out and then you can all see what my freaking email is?
9340000	9341000	I will turn...
9341000	9344000	I will hide the game off a screen.
9344000	9346000	But I might have to log back in again.
9346000	9347000	No, let's game audio.
9347000	9348000	Hold on.
9348000	9349000	Game chat, donations.
9349000	9350000	In game?
9350000	9351000	No.
9351000	9352000	Right.
9352000	9355000	I'm going to do that just in case because I don't know if it's going to show.
9355000	9357000	You can set it to 25 minutes.
9357000	9358000	Oh, I've not set it.
9358000	9359000	Okay.
9359000	9361000	Give me like three minutes.
9361000	9362000	I'm going to pee.
9362000	9364000	I'm going to make a cup of tea.
9364000	9368000	I do recommend you get up, stretch your legs, get some water and then we are going to do
9368000	9369000	actual cooking.
9369000	9372000	We're going to do actual cooking now, I think.
9372000	9375000	Because we've hit the quest point thing.
9375000	9378000	I don't know.
9378000	9380000	But okay.
9380000	9381000	Give me...
9381000	9386000	Let me cook for like three minutes and by cook, I mean let me boil a freaking a kettle.
9386000	9387000	Okay.
9388000	9389000	Right.
9389000	9391000	I will be a moment.
9391000	9392000	Okay.
9392000	9393000	Three minutes.
9393000	9394000	Go for a go for a tinkle-winkle.

11157000	11170600	sorry I've got gains to get bye bye I don't think I was a roofland I was
11170600	11175000	someone that was interested in what we're doing see how you feel like four is going from there
11175000	11179400	she literally at the start was no this will not be an endurance human after a few hours she
11179400	11185800	doesn't know anymore it's hard just the bots hanging out doing a lot of bot things he wants to
11185800	11192040	talk about his cars extended warranty I literally I do not want to talk to you leave me alone old
11192040	11199480	man he's getting harassed by an NPC shadow wizard and when you get how how purple are those anchovies

11225960	11231480	oh my god leveling up we're getting them gains I did not realize how slow fishing was to get
11231960	11232680	my goodness
11236920	11244360	she doesn't want to leave us honestly I like after the so I can apply for monetization I'm
11244360	11248760	going to apply after the stream and see what happens I don't know how long it's going to take
11250760	11258120	but um tomorrow's ASMR so that's short and then the taste test and stream is short as well
11258760	11264600	however it might work out better because if I get monetized then I'm doing my pop-up
11264600	11270760	monetization stream surprise thing um I know I'm fishing but there's no fishy
11272360	11276360	I wish you good luck on the month yeah basically YouTube just reviews the account and goes yeah
11276360	11280600	good to go oh man my bank is locked can you hit me up again in three days
11280840	11296520	I don't know what that means back to fishing we're just fishing uh but yes um we're just
11296520	11304120	going to level up as much as we can do right now um any ringfoot adventure streams yeah
11305080	11310120	100% I absolutely adore love ring uh ringfoot adventure
11311560	11317880	and it was really fun as long as it's not dangerous for my car but I'm pretty sure I got
11317880	11323560	pretty high last time do you have an idea of how many more watch hours you need oh I made
11323560	11329880	watchers the problem was YouTube wasn't updating our stats for one week like the stats are now
11329880	11338680	behind one week like it doesn't make sense um so only now I can apply even though after debut
11339240	11346360	we had watch time like it's just a bit it's a bit silly but um we're submitting we also think now
11346360	11353480	that we have one confirmed like week of stats the culling stops here so you might be unsubscribed
11353480	11357800	if you're watching in right now I don't know but don't be afraid to like and subscribe to the stream
11357880	11366200	helps out you know that jazz but um we think the culling has stopped so a few ASMR group collabs
11366200	11373960	and all that are gonna come out shortly after monetization because the girls some dummy used
11373960	11379720	my email to make an account and one of the passwords I use that's just like as great
11379720	11385320	names ring fit my blood please don't push yourself too hard like that one time I don't I just really
11385320	11393000	enjoyed it but I can't do like subscribe and send your bank card details hell yeah um just thumbs
11393000	11399560	up right now thank you I don't know why but haven't been subbed on once um maybe it's because I got
11399560	11405640	YouTube premium I don't know what caused it because I did get marshmallows that are like no I like
11405640	11410600	I straight up gotten subbed by like three of the girls or did this or whatever I don't know if it's
11410600	11415560	also related to if you don't watch the girls like shorts or if you don't watch any content but
11415560	11421480	subscribe and then peace out then YouTube don't like that and see it as bot activity rather than
11421480	11425720	someone subscribing and being like I'll come back later and watch this like not everyone watches YouTube
11425720	11433080	shorts um which reminds me I should have sent two shorts to Emmy to review because the editor had
11433080	11440520	finished those shorts I'm going to do that after stream and solve by watching everyone
11440520	11445800	literally if you put if you watch their shorts or puts like some minutes and a watch time into them
11445800	11452920	then I think YouTube doesn't um take you I got unsubbed from some other VTubers pre-davio but
11452920	11458520	not from any of the girls good good that's what I like to hear so me subscribing just to support
11458520	11465880	is pointless oh no like actual YouTube subscribe is not pointless what happened was the accounts
11465880	11471880	were getting called because they were new and for bot protection we were getting wrecked but we
11471880	11478120	think now because there's one week of confirmed stats it's over like I don't think we got called
11478120	11487640	at all recently like today or when I was asleep so yeah so I think it's only going up from here
11487640	11492920	now thankfully I like check the stats of everyone's accounts and we should have been at 5k right now
11492920	11501400	but it's okay we'll we'll work back up towards it um yes it's weird I know it's bot protection
11501960	11509400	I had never experienced it before and me oh my it was aggressive on us very aggressive but I do
11509400	11513800	think it's I genuinely do believe it's over especially once the girls get monetized I don't
11513880	11519080	think you experience it as a monetized channel because that just seems a bit odd because they
11519080	11524840	know if you're being watched by bots or not so oh my god my mind's are cracking okay I'm gonna
11524840	11531560	slip my slip I'm gonna sip my tea please don't do anything to the slit okay
11539480	11540040	delicious
11543880	11546600	but yes I have a very fun collapse coming out soon TM
11546600	11559960	I can't wait YouTube stopped in oh literally it's such a shame I felt so bad for the girls
11559960	11564840	because we were like in the discord like oh my god we're at 3000 subscribers oh my god oh my god
11564840	11571800	like getting ready to make but like all of us held back from doing a celebration post because it
11571800	11580760	just wasn't happening and it was such a shame I do have a special like congrats on 5k for everyone
11580760	11585560	posting a 10k and then I don't know what's happening after that if I should order more artwork or not
11586680	11591320	the 10k artwork is absolutely gorgeous so I can't wait for everyone to react to it

14510840	14517080	there's boss like and it's like why you get more exp for cooking rather than yeah
14518120	14522200	there's only one real ending to that game and I will accept no other

14553400	14557960	hear their name just like jack and then just freak you out and then we just go back to the
14557960	14563480	gameplay and I played nothing happened what's another popular boy name I have no idea

14646840	14653080	fish and then we're done if I don't burn any actually they're really starting not to get burnt

14669720	14677080	never wears up no I have to make aware all I'm not really into perma effect hypnosis it's just not

15071640	15077640	of tea for the non endurance stream right yeah surely as I say hold on the four hour mark and
15077640	15081960	we're not even like level 20 and cooking yeah not an endurance stream at all
15081960	15089640	oh google chrome apparently translates marshmallow as well but now if I send the marshmallow you'll
15089640	15097000	know it's me no actually because I'm not opening them up right now and for some reason marshmallow
15097000	15102840	puts like five questions from like loads of different times together at once it doesn't make
15102840	15112280	any sense send the most horrendous cringe marshmallow and sign your name at the bottom
15112280	15118760	like a gigatab I played when I was five on my older brother's account oh did he like force you
15118760	15130600	to go questing that's funniest anything this isn't runescape huh it's old school runescape
15131560	15133880	oh no we're getting corrections
15135880	15145720	oh wow doing bot run on your brother's account for him oh I said Lamalle twice in the same
15145720	15153720	sense oh my god cringe so cringe give it here you're in a level 14 fishing I mean we're getting
15153720	15161160	somewhere oh no I think I might need pee pee bye bye time as well actually yeah a tea and a pee
15161160	15166600	might but not a tea not the pee in the pee but I need a pee in the pee in general
15171880	15178280	key quest is how often are these old school rooms I was gonna do a few endurance streams I have no
15178280	15184840	idea how long cooking takes so I was gonna do a few endurance streams of it I was gonna try and
15184840	15191720	finish it in one month but I don't know if that's just being like far too crazy cut off fish wrapper
15191720	15205160	needs the tea and a pee on runescape with the refunds doing nothing hunting for shrimp I can't
15205240	15208760	rhyme can't do it I don't know how people do it at the same time
15210760	15215160	you can reasonably get night night cooking less than 30 hours okay I know currently we're not
15215160	15228520	maxing but it'll do it'll do I'm gonna do that we did it 30 hours of one tick clicking
15229240	15236360	level 20 cooking do we still burn shrimp on 20 with carab
15237240	15244360	one this carab one's a real thing it might be in print oh I don't think you burn after level 20
15247320	15252920	a reefling check for those of you who are on a fresh account what level are we looking at 20 as well
15253560	15261320	you guys 20 carambuas or oh she sees okay you're done
15264520	15269800	I've got 21 I've got 23 how are you all faster than me okay we'll go a little reefling
15271240	15279720	okay what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a pee and a tea a classic um and we will be back
15280680	15285880	hi how's runescaping we're doing good uh if you ever wanted to join in we're in world 3a
15286440	15291640	top right there uh why is my latest tip we're not working it should be rotating right now
15293240	15302200	sorry latest and uh and then we're gonna move to barbarian village next and we're gonna see what
15302200	15314840	happens if there's oh wait no we can hmm the problem is I don't want to mute the in-game chat
15314840	15321400	because of the bots I'm gonna go to bed have fun cooking oh well thank you for everything thank you
15321400	15331240	for the extortionate prices for the shearers and all that um I just realized we would probably have
15331240	15339320	to fat fly fish the fish ourselves unless we went to the grand exchange but only I have
15339320	15346520	access to all the fish in my inventory so it's not like we can share it out equally hmm the
15346520	15353640	bots on this world won't speak I mean I can't I just ignore them if we have to fly fish I think
15353640	15361320	we need like level 20 fishing so we would be here for a bit longer hmm but rest well there's
15361320	15370600	reeflings that do need to sleep yeah we would need 20 for the trout hmm oh sorry I just like we need
15370920	15379000	fish and wine maybe we should pray but how can fish fly are you telling me this fish flies
15385560	15390600	hmm I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm not sure you guys want to be held here for another
15391960	15395160	what it were until we get like the actual level needed
15395640	15401640	hmm I'm thinking but my brain isn't really coming up with any solutions it's either
15403720	15407480	no there is no solution we have to keep being here until level 20 fishing
15410360	15415480	and then we can move on it's gonna be a long road either well yeah literally if it takes 30 hours of
15417160	15421880	like are you telling me a shrimp right this way are you telling me I've cuddled this fish
15421880	15427400	yeah um if it's going to be a 30 hour stream anyway congrats on 20
15428680	15435800	no questing for airy levels suck hmm yeah we're also pretty low on combat for fresh
15435800	15444920	starts as well which is a bit hmm I don't know what we should do are you telling me I cuddled
15445640	15448280	exactly you can do
15450600	15457400	miss the mystery well here that quest is right here oh do we need okay how about that
15457400	15462120	we go for a T and a P and we're gonna do some more questing just to break up the the fishing
15462120	15467960	because that was quite a few levels we've got with fishing so we'll go do some questing and
15469560	15472760	and then it can be broken up a little bit because I don't want to like hurt you too much
15473400	15478440	just doing it over and over oh no you mean we have to stay here and keep chatting forever
15478440	15484040	I would hate that oh wow oh that would suck yeah I'm glad I'm glad you enjoy my rambles

15564520	15574760	Tint as in tint of a color and it's ink tint and so it means tinted fish the tint of the ink oh that's

16030980	16032340	wait
16032340	16033380	why is he greeting
16033380	16038340	Wait, what do you mean disconnected? I'm not disconnected! Wait, why are you
16038340	16044260	greeting? What are you saying? She loves us. What? I never said that, didn't I?
16044260	16051620	Because I went for a tinkle. You have 30 days. She's back quick, hide the memes.
16051620	16056940	What were you doing while I was away? I've been away for a few minutes. How was the
16056940	16062060	pee? It was not a lot of liquid again and I've literally finished up all the
16062060	16067020	water. So, and I had a tea, and I finished a can of cola. I've got another bottle of
16067020	16071620	water here. I don't know if you can hear my nails kind of against it. I'm gonna
16071620	16076820	try and finish that and the tea. I'm not really sure what's going on.
16076820	16083540	I'm being pranked. I've been pranked by my body. Wait, why does someone say she
16083540	16091740	doesn't love us hard eyes? What? By the way, reeflings are the best. You say
16091740	16098980	Coca-Cola. I hear burps. Cola burps. Cola burps. We did kiss the homies. Don't tell
16098980	16104780	Amy that, she'll be jealous. I'm freaking, wait, I just caught an anchovy.
16104820	16113940	What does it do? Oh wait, I'm now catching an anchovy because I'm a level? Oh, maybe
16113940	16120420	that'll speed up the fishing level gain. Okay, I didn't know that. You put
16120420	16126340	anchovies on a pizza. I don't think I've ever tasted that before. Burps. Oh, I was
16126340	16132620	so proud when Shabee started burping in her streams. I was like, oh my god. My
16132660	16139140	literal daughter. Oh my god. With all the tea she drinks, Johnny will be really
16139140	16153740	sophisticated. That's not bad. The burps are hot. I don't understand the appeal of it,
16153740	16164500	but then someone said, think of it about the aftermath. Give your run air back, I
16164500	16176780	believe. We get to rate more mouth pranks. Why do you keep on firing? That's why
16176780	16182180	there's a freaking fire. I'm getting pranked by the spine. Oh, I'm still burning
16182220	16189780	stuff. I'm not level. I'm literally cooking level 22 and I'm still burning. That's pretty
16189780	16196260	rough after this. This is taking us a hot second. Right, so what fishing level do we need?
16196260	16207180	We need fishing level 20. Shabee made a burp speed. She's indeed cheaper. Exactly. That's what
16207180	16215260	I thought. Tea bag in the fire. It's running, I kneel. I get so many things like, oh, I kneel
16215260	16220500	for all the choices. The barbed village spot has a permanent fire to cook on. Oh, right,
16220500	16230220	I'll put my tinderbox and axe away. And then we will buy fishing gear. We farm until 20
16230220	16234300	fishing. I did know that. Yeah, we're going to do 20 fishing and then we're going to buy
16234620	16242780	rods because some of us don't have that attachment. And then we get to go to Barbarian Village and we
16242780	16250620	fish and we just keep doing that for a while. I think maybe we could get 40 doing that because
16250620	16255740	salmon. However, the problem is the cost of feathers, but the problem's already been solved
16255740	16261900	thanks to reeflings literally giving me an insane amount of in-game currency. Oh no,
16261900	16267980	we're doing a quest. I completely forgot. I apologize. We are fishing level 20 fishing and
16267980	16271900	then we're going to do a quest that's right here that begins with M. We're going to do maybe three
16271900	16279020	quests just to break up the little fishing segment a little bit. It's called Mythilene Mystery.
16279020	16285180	Mythilene Mystery. Burps are saying you ever like come through around someone. I am like, yeah.
16286700	16290060	Some people like get taught it's really rude manners. Like obviously it's rude,
16290140	16296380	like you wouldn't be in a job interview and burp in there. Actually speaking of burping in job
16296380	16301340	interviews, I'm like 90% sure I accidentally burped when I was interviewing one of the girls
16301340	16307580	revealer now that I think about it. Absolutely mortified. I think it might have been in me.
16307580	16312380	You know that? No, it couldn't have been in me. I think it might have been Mercy. Someone
16312460	16314620	had burped and I was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry.
16320300	16323180	Did you hear about the Talon chef who died? He passed away.
16326940	16329180	Oh, that didn't go, that didn't go down well.
16331580	16338620	32, I think to stop burping, burning shrimp. Level 32, you stop burning shrimp. That's insane.
16338620	16344700	Brian. Stronny, I hope you're proud. I was reading a comic earlier and all I heard was your
16344700	16351740	voice. I'm so cooked. Oh, did that actually happen? Am I in your head? Thank you,
16352460	16356860	Senpai. Am I in your head? Is my accent in your head?
16369260	16373500	Okay, hopefully that hypno's off, that reverbs off on the mic because I actually
16373900	16376060	I didn't say a thing that tells me if it's on or not.
16380140	16388700	Always in your head. Soon, world domination. Soon, the first 99 cooking, okay. It's more
16388700	16399980	attractive if someone doesn't care about it. Giving my wood the sort of group. What? Who is
16399980	16404380	Riefling is this? Come get your Riefling. You've been in my head for a long time, Stronny.
16406700	16410940	Cryo Freeze, Momento. See, Stronny, that's why I didn't want the undo button.
16411580	16417180	Want an undo button. Right, I'm definitely cooking fish a heck of a lot faster now.
16417980	16419980	Catching fish, my apologies, not cooking.
16430620	16439420	We need to video game OST ranking. Okay, that slightly slows down progress now that we're
16439420	16445260	also getting anchovies as well. I keep accidentally trying to use fish on people. I've literally
16445340	16451500	slapped so many Rieflings with shrimp right now and feel really bad. Hopefully touching
16451500	16457420	your legs with my shrimp. I'm like, please take my raw shrimp. At 21, I can finally turn cream.
16458780	16461020	But we all turn cream together at the same time.
16466860	16473340	If you look at it, it's kind of like a cute little fishing campsite. Riefling's on.
16475580	16485180	There's a place to turn cream and lump. Wait, we can actually do it?
16487180	16491500	Hey, I thought we had to wait for another time for doing that. Honestly, right by Farmer
16491980	16495740	I didn't even know you can turn by. Take it, take my raw shrimp.
16506060	16510860	I'm really happy that you said you love Germany. It's the first time we've worn something.
16511740	16519180	Deutschland Uber alles! Deutschland Uber alles! There you go. That's like all the German I could
16519180	16523580	come up with. Just Deutschland Uber alles. Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaver.
16525980	16531980	Wait, I don't know why. Nope, that wasn't it. Don't do that again. Why?
16536060	16538940	Hold on. I'm going to try, I don't know why it doesn't like that.
16539420	16542220	I don't know why it's frozen.
16546940	16550940	I'm so sorry, my little scroll and don't know things frozen. I'm gonna have to fix that next thing.
16552140	16555740	Well, no way you can say that. Wait, what does Deutschland Uber alles means?
16557020	16560540	Wait, if I just said something really bad, I thought it meant like Germany number one.
16560540	16565420	Like China number one. What did I just say in German?
16565820	16568780	Did I just say something really bad?
16570940	16576140	I thought it meant China number one, but German number one. What did I just say?
16583180	16585980	Did I just say something really bad? It sounds like...
16586300	16594620	No, it's fine, but it can be associated with other stuff. I am so sorry,
16596620	16598700	bitter. I am so sorry.
16602460	16610540	I thought it meant China number one. Let's just forget about it. I am so sorry. I genuinely
16610540	16613900	thought it meant China number one, but Germany number one.
16616940	16620860	When you learned your German from Call of Duty, unironically, like...
16621740	16627580	Oh my God, idiot, absolute idiot. I'm so sorry. I do apologize for that.
16629980	16634860	It's the first line of a national anthem. Oh wait, it's the first line of the national...
16634860	16635980	German national anthem?
16639420	16643500	It's only problematic if you use in a specific contact. Oh, okay.
16644380	16650300	Shawnee, tomorrow will start to pop out strange fan art of you in a strange and nostalgic outfit.
16657980	16662380	Just remember, I don't own rights to previous things. That's what you're gonna...
16662940	16667260	Like, I might not be able to interact with it if you're maybe getting a bit too cheeky.
16668140	16673660	Yeah, their national anthem from 1930s. Wait, not... I'm sorry, I really didn't...
16674300	16677500	Which Germany... Oh God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
16679980	16684700	Oh, genuinely thought it meant China number one. Like, I don't know if you guys ever played
16685260	16693180	pub G or something, pub Newgrounds or whatever. But everyone used to come in and go China number
16693180	16699100	one. And that was it. That's basically what I thought I just said, but I did not say that at all.
16702060	16705420	Don't worry, I'm new here. How do I find where you are on the map?
16706780	16711580	So when you open up map, you will start here right outside of Lumberge.
16712860	16717980	And you just take a... Or maybe you started at the quest guy. He's like literally right here.
16717980	16722940	You want to go south. You can always use this cross here and click it and it will make everything
16723420	16729180	like north point north. And then just come south through a graveyard and we are literally all here.
16730540	16733740	So south through a graveyard and south again.
16735340	16735820	Brian!
16738940	16743500	I'm so sorry. I didn't... I genuinely didn't know what it meant. I do apologize.
16744700	16750540	I thought like... I thought everyone was like yay because I said Germany number one.
16750620	16756300	And there's a few German watchers and no, I'm just an idiot. So yep, there's that. Apologies.
16757180	16761500	Sorry. Thank you for the tip. I do apologize.
16763900	16769900	Ah, cringing at myself. I'm like, oh, maybe I should cut that segment out of the void honestly.
16769900	16774620	I don't want anything happening. Like anything weird happening. Don't stress about it.
16775820	16777020	Okay, I'll try to get there.
16781500	16785820	I can't stop laughing. No, I don't laugh at me. I literally... Anyone got a fire?
16787820	16791340	Yeah, probably take that out. I want to ask, how are you already so good at this?
16791340	16796460	I watched someone else try and they only have two quests left in FTP but still need attack.
16796460	16801580	Oh, I'm not good at the game. What? You were literally in it with us. I'm rubbish at the game.
16802620	16808860	Well, actually we have one, two, three, four and five. We have five quests done.
16808860	16814060	Oh wait, are you memeing? I watched someone try and they only have two quests left in FTP
16814060	16817900	but still need a taxi to Viroc. Oh right, because I actually threw the game.
16818540	16824060	What's the timestamp? Hold on. Four hours and like 38 minutes.
16825980	16832060	Hold on, I need to make more of that. Four hours, 48 minutes.
16839100	16843900	Oh, be on my... Right, there we go, wrote a note.
16844860	16846620	Time to get this board chopped up.
16848460	16851580	We have other... Another 90 levels of cooking in front of us.
16851580	16856940	Don't let your... Your not... Sorry, the love heart's in the freaking way.
16856940	16859740	In fact, it's in the way again. You're not Dutch knowledge, so...
16860620	16866060	Hello, I am a Dutchman. I know how to speak Dutch.
16866060	16869980	Yes, I know how to speak Dutch.
16871660	16877500	Only 13 million XP to go. No, no, no cuttles, we're laughing with you. I was laughing at you.
16877500	16878220	Okay, okay.
16880940	16884700	Relaxing stream. Okay, I'm glad you find it chill like that.
16885020	16891900	I'm sorry, I'm at the stage where I'm now cringing at myself thinking
16892860	16897340	I thought that meant Germany number one in all the contexts that I'd ever seen that phrase.
16901820	16907020	Anyway, I'm going to drink my tea and I'm probably going to cringe myself to sleep tonight.
16909740	16913740	Have you declared... Have you declared war to something with that sentence or opened a bakery?
16913740	16915900	Good people. Hopefully the bakery.
16917100	16922700	You're fine. Oh no, is there fire maker going offline? I will make us a fire, don't you worry.
16923660	16928140	Come, let me go get a tree. I think there's a tree in the swamp or something.
16930940	16934060	Is there not a dead tree in here? Am I going crazy?
16936460	16940220	I could have sworn there's like a dead tree in the swamp that you can... Oh, there is.
16941180	16946060	I'm going to get jumped by a frog, but I'm going to be so quick with froggy and got time to attack me.
16946780	16953740	Oh, I'm full. All right, drop, take the tree, and then run all the way back to the tree.
16954780	16961100	Oh, you made fire. Sorry. Oh my god, my woodcutting is so bad. It's going to take forever to cut this tree.
16961980	16968460	Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it. I have 50, not to brag or anything, but I've got 50 XP in woodcutting.
16970540	16976940	Let's see. Okay, okay, we're back, we're back, we're back.
16988540	16995820	Just so you know, Germany number one means Deutschland of dying irons. Maybe next time. Yeah.
16996300	17001580	Deutschland, Deutschland of dying irons.
17005100	17011420	We're learning who said streams and educate your man, huh? Get that on fire.
17015820	17020380	A whole 50, literally, not to brag.
17021340	17026700	What if you moved on to higher tier fish? So we're currently trying to get fishing level 20,
17026700	17029740	and then we're going to do some questing just to get over all XP,
17031340	17036620	and then we're going to move on to higher level fish, just to kind of break it up with a bit of fun
17036620	17044940	questing in between. I hope I don't pass out too early to the confidence of this company and me so hard.
17045660	17057500	Learning that a Scottish cut official of Germany, yes, this is educational content you've chosen one for.
17067500	17069500	Are you squidding me right now?
17070460	17073100	If it's for you, then we'll start the third world.
17080780	17090860	Thank you for the tip, iron reefer, hardy har har. No, no, bad Brian. Don't read that out loud, Brian.
17090940	17100060	That's naughty. There'll be no world wars. If anything, I'm actually a field medic,
17101500	17108060	so I'm here to stitch you up and give you all negative blood when you're perishing from blood loss.
17108460	17116620	I'm literally a bad boy, Brian, bad boy. Don't say that out loud. Oh my gosh.
17120380	17126300	No AI, the AI uprising. What's going on here? Oh, I'm itching my little schnozer. I'm going to
17126300	17135180	take a sip of my tea and see if it's, oh my god, it's the perfect sipping temperature,
17135180	17139260	truly a British moment when you enjoy, when you appreciate the temperature of the tea.
17142940	17147020	What are we on for fishing? Oh wait, I'm on 18 fishing. What are you guys on for fishing? We
17147020	17151500	must be getting close. We can do the quest very shortly. I'm going to put all of this in my bank
17151500	17158860	though. I am not questing with all of this money on me. Sorry, don't kill some of the money. I'm
17158860	17171580	zero negative life. The perfect cup of the perfect time, perfect dunking. Oh, what are they called?
17171580	17176460	Apparently custard cream's got named the best dunkable biscuit. Oh, you're like, how are you
17176460	17182140	guys higher level than me, honestly? Yeah, are you cheesy, don't run.
17188380	17189820	Did the Scott have a British moment?
17192300	17200220	Unfortunately, I do seem to share some traits. Can I even light logs or is it going to take forever?
17200220	17207420	Because I'm such a low level in fire like making three, four. Oh, it took me four times.
17207420	17212540	Honestly, that wasn't that bad. 15, but I had to step away a few times. Ah.
17214700	17218460	Oh, you had to step away because my, my soundboard jokes were just too good.
17222620	17226220	Remember the one time when Facebook released an AI on the internet and learned from the
17226220	17229180	community that turned into the biggest thing going wrong?
17236140	17239420	Oh, it's four men in uniform to carry my little souls through home.
17239420	17248060	What should he do? Should have been a musician, but he didn't have the money for a guitar.
17249100	17255900	What should he do? Should have been a politician, but he didn't have a property. This is not the
17255900	17262460	song that was. Did we do it? We're almost there. We flings. We're so close to 20.
17263900	17268300	We're so close. By the way, do you have a plan for stages of cooking levels that would do it
17268300	17276700	chilling spot until 99? I absolutely have no plan whatsoever. I've returned with logs for my fire duty.
17278540	17284540	I honestly have no plan whatsoever. We're going to move on to Salmon and Trout at
17284540	17290700	Barbarian Village after we do some questing. And then after that, I think it's just jugs of wine.
17290700	17294620	And we're literally going to be hanging out like maybe at the Grand Exchange on like a very quiet
17294700	17304220	server. Oh, level 19 fishing. There might be a quest we're going to do.
17306540	17312540	Sorry for letting my inner German out, my guess. By the way, do you, oh no, the fact that she didn't
17312540	17316140	correct the message does mean that she already chose to go straight to level 99.
17316860	17320620	Yeah, that's the plan anyway. We're going to do some questing just to break it up.
17320700	17330380	And then we are going to jump back into it. I want to see if maybe we could do level 40 today.
17330380	17334940	I don't think I'm going to do a full endurance stream as much as I love to harass you guys
17335900	17341020	and destroy your sleep pattern. I don't think we're going to do a full 12 hour stream today.
17342300	17348780	Also, my freaking VOD broke. Apparently the VODs break on 11 hours and 55 minutes,
17348780	17354780	not on the 12th hour. So the end of my VOD got chopped away and it just cuts off.
17356540	17366780	15 trout, 20 is and 25 is salmon. Oh, we can make apple pies. Oh, I have a muffin.
17368380	17370700	I have an apple muffin. I forgot to eat it yesterday.
17371180	17375980	Yeah, something's like not really...
17377100	17379740	YouTube VODs are almost especially the longer ones. Yeah.
17381340	17385660	Oh, is it displaying again correctly? Maybe it changed. Yeah, they told us.
17386780	17389820	That is a sad and frightening, so speaking super fast.
17393420	17396860	M&M's got nothing on me when I'm saying bioreflums. Okay, I'm like,
17401660	17406300	eh, that explains why all the other VJubers stopped 10 minutes before the 12 hour mark.
17406300	17412620	Yeah, so unfortunately, we are having to bend the knee to the VOD overlords. I wonder,
17412620	17415900	I suppose they had to give a number, like it doesn't matter.
17418540	17426060	Circum... wait, I thought it said circumstance. Sure, you're not a mumble rat. Oh, I'm a mumble
17426060	17434700	rat. I can assure you that much. I'm annunciating the words right now. I'm annunciating. Any annunciators?
17440540	17441900	Oh, come on, catch that last one.
17444380	17453260	Anything to do with this inventory full of shrimp? Drop them. If you go, you cook them on the fire
17453260	17458780	and then you drop them once they're all cooked. It sounds like a decision made for some technical
17458780	17463260	reason over at you. Yeah, like, I assumed they had to put like a number on it, but they couldn't
17463260	17470220	just infinitely do it. Although there's those accounts that used to infinitely stream music,
17470220	17475740	was it lo-fi girl or something like that? They just like constantly like keep going.
17476300	17483660	I'll chug them all. If you go into sentence, you can hit, I think it's like controls or something,
17483660	17487820	and it's like use shift to drop, and then if you hold shift, you can drop your full inventory stack
17487820	17502700	really quickly. Okay, level 25 cooking. I'll take it, like we're getting there. It's if I could stop
17502700	17507580	burning this stuff, if we stop burning, we'd be like literally flying through the levels.
17508140	17516780	Right, 20 is maybe one more deck officially. Lo-fi girl never saved vods and didn't let you
17516780	17524540	rewind, so that could be why. We are learning. Okay, more of my tea. I keep forgetting.
17528700	17530460	And these fishes are hiding from me.
17533580	17540140	So I assume it costs money to get some of these hysterics costumes, because
17540940	17546940	these are like total costumes. I have to go in 10 minutes. I can't stay on Firejoy forever.
17546940	17551180	Yes, that's okay. Don't worry, we can take over. We're probably doing by Quest next.
17552220	17559820	But thank you for your service. Wait, hold on, 07. Thank you for your service on Firejoy. 07,
17559820	17567980	we salute. Yeah, Wi-Fi, low-fi girl is more like a follower radio channel.
17567980	17574300	Yeah. The only MTX in old-school RuneScape is Bond.
17580060	17585020	You can stream non-stop, but when you end the VOD, it will only save the foot 11.55.
17585100	17594060	Hmm. Well, I'll need to know that for the Donathons, because Azuras is first.
17596380	17600860	20! I'm finally fishing level 20. That took so long.
17604620	17611980	I can drop them. Okay, we're level 20. We're gonna do questing once I finish this batch that I've got.
17612940	17617180	And then we'll go to the bank and drop off all our items and see what this Quest
17617180	17620460	mini thing is all about. I don't know if I need any items for it, is it this?
17621820	17624460	It began with an M, so let's scroll down to M.
17628060	17629420	Let's scroll up to M.
17633740	17640460	Mystery, what do we need for that? We need, oh, we get a reward. What do we need for it?
17640460	17648620	Recommended items, none. Enemies to defeat, none. Okay, right. We'll definitely do this.
17649260	17654700	Nicely. Oh, she is right there. Okay, that makes perfect sense by that reefling. Suggested that
17655820	17662540	silly of me. If we're going to do some quests, we're going to the city, then we're going to the
17662540	17668540	city, then the door closes, won't close back. We're gonna put our items away first before we
17668540	17672140	continue with the questing. I actually have to go to, don't worry if you have to go,
17672140	17677260	thank you so much reeflings for hanging, I appreciate it. I am going to try and get level
17677260	17683500	99 in one month for cooking, so there will be plentiful opportunities to come hang.
17684380	17689020	I'm also going to do it during the week instead of on the weekend as well to give
17690460	17696380	the people who work on the weekends a chance as well to come in and join in the fun.
17698540	17704700	Okay, everyone who is fishing, if you want to cook the fish, we're going to take it to the bank,
17704700	17709020	if you want to cook it the new, and then we're going to make our way to the castle,
17709020	17715500	and then we're going to come back and, oh, my fire, my fire perished.
17717180	17724300	So get cooking, good looking. Oh wait, that's the song, hey, good looking. What you got cooking?
17725100	17730140	It's shrimp on a fire, shrimp on the barbie. Oh, we're so Aussie out here.
17731260	17740540	Can you go back to the mystery area after you finish? Oh wait, should we just do the quest?
17743180	17746940	Reeflings have done the quest, should we just do the quest now instead of going all the way back
17746940	17757740	and like here again? I finished my tea, yeah, you can't. Do they actually eat a lot of shrimp
17757740	17762380	in Aussie land? I don't know, just do the quest, okay, we'll do the quest.
17766380	17769900	I'll wait for everyone to finish up and do their thing, and then we'll start.
17770860	17776860	So let you guys cook, those who are fishing, you can un-fish and cook, and then we'll start
17776860	17783420	with this quest, and we'll pick another one. We'll do three quests I think, and I either need to do
17783420	17791740	stream split recording, yeah, for the donathons, I know you need to do back to back, so I'm actually
17791740	17795980	gonna have to get like a video put together for Azura to play when she goes to sleep.
17795980	17801420	Hopefully her PC doesn't explode midstream. Should be a way to sleep in the thing just
17802540	17805100	catch some fire in the corner of the room and she's like, okay.
17810780	17817340	We eat prawns. Are you squidding me right now? Who goes there Brian? Do you read Patreon messages?
17818060	17822380	No, so none of the talents have access to Patreon messages because it's like direct
17822460	17828860	messages, so they don't have access to that stuff? No. So no, I read Marshmallows though,
17828860	17837980	your mother won't come to send a moishie. I'm drinking water now after finishing my tea.
17843180	17849100	Okay, is everyone almost ready? I'm gonna drop three inventory space, I'll just drop
17849100	17855900	three anchovies, why not? Right, we will talk to this lady, I'll put walking on.
17856540	17865580	Let's see what happens. Help, help! Start the quest. Sure, are you guys ready to come over?
17867340	17870940	I'll get to 20 later. Yeah, we can always come back and do our thing.
17873260	17878140	Thank you for the tip though Anonymous. You really are shy, you could ask that for free,
17878140	17882380	you didn't have to give me money to ask that question. You guys are always welcome to ask and
17882380	17886140	chat, I know it can be never again, or you can ask in Marshmallow but I might be sold to respond
17886140	17892300	because I'm not reading Marshmallows right now. Thank you for the tip but save your money at the
17892300	17900060	same time, seriously. Ray, are we ready? Are you my refillings? You are. You're not quite ready,
17900060	17906700	hold on. Oh, sorry, right, I'm accepting the quest. What has happened here? We were invited to
17906700	17910140	house party on the island, not far from here, something felt wrong about the whole thing but
17910140	17913900	we went away. The house seemed pretty creepy but everything was going fine, we were having a good
17913900	17920700	time and that's when we got attacked and I tried to save her. Huey brought me enough time to find
17920700	17926140	an old boat, I went back to get him but it was too late, I'm scared he won't make it. You have to do
17926140	17932700	something, they can't get away with this. What do you want me to do? That cycle is still out there,
17932700	17937900	you have to bring them to justice. The boat we escaped on is just over there and you can use
17937900	17944220	it to get to the island. Okay, I'll see what I can do. I need to fight, I hope not. Can reflings see
17944220	17956060	this boat over here? Are you pointing the way? Let's check that you're all here. Who's got a
17956060	17964860	refling? Got a few. Okay, end of the boat, end of the boat. Benjens, how bold of you considering
17964860	17969980	she has a plan? Strania, I was wondering if you were following some kind of gay deciding to do,
17969980	17974300	nah I'm just going for it. We're literally doing quest and right now like I'm already getting distracted
17975500	17982940	from the 99 grind. Okay, I think that's all my reflings, these are
17983820	17990540	actual plots. Okay, into the boat we go, yippee! There's a chance you ask the question and
17990540	17995740	check, typically better chance, I don't know. I know but you can still do it for free, just
17995740	18002540	like keep, like if I miss it then ask it again in like a couple of minutes. Oh my god, there's so
18002540	18007740	many of us doing this quest right now, we're gonna overload this. It looks kind of familiar.
18007980	18015980	Oh, okay, we need to take a left refling, for those of you who don't have the plugin,
18016860	18021740	we're gonna pick up this bucket right here on the left. Oh no, is it instance bucket? Why are
18021740	18029100	we taking the bucket? Pick up from the bucket, is it an instance bucket? Oh no, we can all take it,
18029100	18038700	okay, that's good. Okay, drop. Okay, everyone get a bucket, pick up your bucket, subscribe by the
18038700	18049260	fountain. Oh my god, the beacons are lit, Gondor calls trade. Okay, and then we have the barrel
18050140	18057100	of rainwater, interact with it, we need to search it. Okay, there's like lots of noises going on.
18059740	18069420	Whoa, party on, bro. Oh, it's like that movie that I've not seen. Whoa, the wind totally just felt
18069420	18083900	like sun breathing on my neck. Oh, not cool, bro. I feel woozy, gurg, I see the light. It's not my
18083900	18089820	time, glurg, glurgle, gargle. Oh, that's a bit. I don't know what movie he's from, I've not seen it,
18090620	18096460	but I've seen it, you know what I mean? I've not seen the movie. Help me.
18099740	18104540	Man, you're taking a while to perish. Sid claps is on the ground in a crumpled mess,
18104540	18109900	as he falls down, you spot something shiny fall out of his shirt pocket and into the barrel of water.
18110860	18117820	Gosh, that was horrible and so drawn out. Oh, wow, he's still going.
18121340	18125500	I think he's actually gone this time. Who are you? Why are you doing this?
18127340	18134300	He didn't say anything. Scary movie. Oh, it's scream. I've got to find a way into that house and stop
18134460	18141660	this maniac. I wonder what it is that I saw fall into that barrel. Search the barrel,
18141660	18147340	reflings. The barrel's full of rainwater. I can't see what's in there. Oh, right, click on the barrel
18147340	18152060	in your inventory and use it on the barrel of rainwater. You fill the bucket from the barrel.
18152060	18157260	Okay, now what? Now we search the barrel. You find a key at the bottom of the barrel.
18158060	18166060	Are you saying strongly? Okay, now we go to the front of the house.
18170380	18175660	It's so scary. Oh, it's making a good noise.
18179180	18184460	Chop down. No, open large door. Okay, here we go. The bunny went ahead. I saw that bunny.
18184460	18191020	He closed the door behind you. Let us in the house. Right, there we go. Oh, the door all
18191020	18197100	closes. Hold on. I think the door all closed. Oh, does it all close? Wait, I can't even get in.
18197100	18203660	Is this open large door? No. I think we're all trying to get in at once, right? I'm not clicking
18203660	18212780	it. I'm just, okay, Danny. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, all right, I'm getting there. We're getting
18213420	18218940	there. We're getting there. Hold on. Hold on. Why am I not going inside? It's not because someone's
18218940	18227420	doing the door thing. It's one at a time. Right, okay, that's fine. Okay, okay, I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.
18227420	18232860	Okay. Oh, that took the hot thing there. Right, let's get the other reflins in. Everyone in, everyone
18232860	18238540	in. Okay, a few more. A few more reflins, fewer stragglers. Can you come? Can you come?
18239260	18247660	One more, one more, and you come, and you come. Click that door. Right, we're in, we're in.
18247660	18254300	Everyone touch the table in the entrance way. Oh my goodness. There's a knife on the table.
18254300	18260940	Touch that table. Ooh, we're touching the table. Okay, once you've touched the table,
18260940	18272460	touch this door. Ooh, the door, the door. Oh, cut scene. Knock, knock. Who's there? Oh, no.
18274780	18282620	Gurgle. Oh, he said you're next to me.
18282780	18291100	Oh, he's using cheat see doodles. What's this? A note? I guess I should read it.
18291100	18296380	Ooh, let's go get the note. Oh, you left the note, okay. It should be a note to your left.
18296380	18302220	You take a copy of the note. Ooh, let's read it. Isn't murder just the work of art,
18302220	18307020	beautiful yet haunting like the blade of a knife as we wander through the valley of death?
18307020	18319340	Ooh, spooky. Oh, okay. Is this on the other side? Oh, okay. Everyone enter this room.
18319340	18324620	It doesn't really, really much of a room. Oh, it's a some room anyway. Oh, look at this painting.
18324620	18332620	Wait, why am I getting turned this way for the painting? Hello? Hello? Okay, examine painting.
18333420	18340060	Wait, what am I supposed to do? Oh, use the knife on the painting. I didn't
18340060	18343180	even know I had a knife on me. Use the knife in your inventory on the painting.
18344220	18348700	Beat that painting up. Show it to your mean boss. You slash open the painting revealing
18348700	18357660	a hidden storage compartment. Search painting. You find a key hidden inside the slash painting.
18357660	18363500	Oh, okay. If you found your key, come back out into the entrance way. If you've got the key
18363500	18369500	from the painting by cutting it up into the entrance way. Okay, just a few more.
18370860	18376300	Use the knife in your inventory on the painting in that room. And then once you've got the key,
18376300	18383340	come back into the hallway. We're doing it. We're questing. They have a higher pit than you.
18384300	18386700	Man, what's a pit?
18390860	18391420	Are we good?
18394300	18401660	There should be a knife in your inventory. And then you can highlight it by using right click
18401660	18410860	and then slash the shizzle of it. There you go, you key. Alrighty. And then we go through this door
18410860	18421660	right here. Oh, there's a reefing party in here, clearly. Oh, so it's spooking us behind the door.
18423500	18427820	Okay, once you enter this new room, there's a little orby thing to the left. I don't know
18427820	18434460	what it does, but it's highlighted. Examine the unlit candle on the wall. Oh, we're to tinder box
18435420	18442060	or to tinder box, the thing on the wall. Tinder box, the unlit candle.
18444380	18447500	Oh, wait, do you guys need a knife or a tinder box or is it like in this room?
18452860	18456620	Do you guys need me to trade this? There's a bunch in here. Okay, okay, that's good.
18457180	18460860	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, literally all in the shelf. There's a tinder box on the shelf if you need help.
18461660	18466140	You light the candle. So light the two unlit candles. Oh, there's a third one as well.
18466140	18471660	Oh, excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Video Game. Oh, I just touched my fish. Hold on, wait.
18476220	18479980	I think she's more happy of the fact that there's only 20 people doing the same.
18481180	18487660	Literally, Jagex is like, what on earth? I'm sure they've had it before where people go
18487660	18492620	questing together. You light the candle. The room is sufficiently warm. The fuse
18492620	18501900	should now have dried out. Oh, once you tinder box all the things, do the barrel?
18504620	18509420	I don't know. And get the heck out of the room. Get out of the room as soon as you light that thing.
18509420	18514220	Hold on, let me run. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room.
18514300	18521420	Oh, the thing about to blow. Oh, okay, okay, okay.
18524460	18529900	All right. Hey, it's the shadow one that kept closing the doors on me.
18531900	18536700	That's not a knife. This is a knife. Why are you so excited if I touch the doors and noodles?
18536700	18540700	I'm just like, it's so fun being like, oh my God, request them together. And for those
18540700	18546220	who don't have room light, I'm like, I'm the quest teller, you know? So once you've let everything
18546220	18550860	and blew it up, we can all go outside in this section. So I'll wait for the reeflings to come
18550860	18553820	over. Yeah, they're like having to get out the room because it's blowing up.
18555900	18562540	I just find it really fun getting to play games together. Momelo. So we're getting
18563260	18566460	the God Sword, right? I don't know what the God Sword is.
18567340	18573500	We are all here merely by coincidence. There's absolutely nothing in common that we all have.
18578620	18582380	Is there anyone else in sake? Are you kidding me right now?
18582940	18589340	Brian. It's 1am. I have to tap out. Sleep well. Enjoy the rest of your stream with the reeflings.
18589340	18593980	Thank you so much, Pajango. Please rest well. Maybe see you in the morning. I don't know if
18593980	18599900	this is endurance yet. Yes, there's four candles in that room to light on the walls. You take a
18599900	18605660	tinder box from the shelf, little tinder box on the shelf, and then you light all four candles in
18605660	18611260	the room. And then there'll be a powder keg that you can light here just on the outskirts of that room.
18611900	18617740	It will blow a hole in the wall, but you need to light it and then leave the room. So it blows up.
18618700	18621100	And then that's you.
18623580	18629020	Or that door. I mean, you're not wrong. I don't know if it blows up if you go out on that door,
18629020	18635660	but the other door. Or did it blow up? Boom. Okay, there you go. I blew up. I think that's
18635660	18642140	all the reeflings. I don't see anyone else hiding in that room. Can you come over? Yeah! Okay,
18642220	18649260	reeflings. Let's go next. Let's go next. We're doing it. Oh, if you click here on the foot,
18650780	18656060	on the mini map up here, it'll put running on. So if it's brown, it means you're walking. If it's
18656060	18662620	golden, it means you're running. Your stamina will regain eventually. So don't worry. Oh,
18662620	18667100	suspiciously. Let's observe this suspicious tree over here.
18667100	18674220	Please stop this. Just let me go. Oh, it's kind of messed up. We're going to play a game. Do you
18674220	18681500	like to play games? Yeah, no. Yes, whatever you say, just then it hurt me. Whether you get hurt
18681500	18686140	or not is entirely up to you. Your fate is in your own hands. What? What do you mean?
18687260	18694060	Leave her alone, you monster. Ah, Scottlefish. How kind of you to join us. Now, if you say another
18694060	18700620	word, I will end her right now. Sorry, where were we? Ah yes, of course, the game. Do you like
18700620	18712060	quests, Lissy? Uh, sure, I like quests. Do you like scary quests? Uh-huh. What's your favorite
18712060	18721020	scary quest? I don't know. You have to have a favorite. Uh, the one with a vampire in it who
18721020	18727820	lives in the big house. Good, good. And now for that game I spoke about. I am going to ask you
18727820	18733580	one question. Get it wrong and you die, but get it right and you live. How is that fair? Oh,
18733580	18739740	gothicks. Please, gothicks? Isn't that a type of armor? Oh, gothicks, please, no, please,
18739740	18745740	don't. I don't want to die. Then think hard about your answer. You like vampires, so this should
18745740	18755340	be easy for you. The question is, who is the vampire that resides in South Mish? I would be
18755340	18763900	perishing. Um, I'm to say nothing. I'm not, I'm not to say anything. He said he's gonna slash her
18763900	18770940	if I say anything. Oh yes, yes, I know it. Count Draenor. Ha, in your face, you masked freak.
18771660	18778380	Oh, Lacy, Lacy, Lacy, I did tell you to think hard about your answer. Count Draenor is in fact a
18778380	18789340	vampire and he does reside in his manor in Mithilith, but that manor is in West Mithilith. I was
18789340	18796220	talking about Count Chek. Thanks for playing. No, no, you tricked me. This isn't fair. Ask me another.
18796220	18809020	Gargle, gargle, gargle, gargle. The writing in this game is, I think it's because I have,
18809020	18816540	oh, he's leaving his notes? Okay, I'll take the note. Do you like jazz? Take the note, please.
18817260	18821740	That monster, oh, I can't do that because I actually only clicked on the note. Oopsies, take note.
18822700	18829980	You take the note, what does it say? It's like music to my ears, the glory sounds spelling out your
18829980	18838460	fate. Oh, okay, get into the, once you pick up the note, there's a piano. Where to do something with
18838460	18847500	it? Someone is throwing Easter eggs everywhere. Play piano. Okay, once you're on the piano,
18848060	18863100	delta, echo, alpha, delta. Did we do it right? Oh, there's a compartment. Can I play for real?
18865260	18867260	Oh, you can't. You can't play this one.
18867260	18877660	You can't play this one. You can't play this one. Oh, I think my inventory is full, hold on.
18877660	18879420	I think there's something I'm supposed to grab.
18882140	18890300	Play piano, search piano, search piano. Oh, once you play that, delta is just, I don't see a delta
18890380	18896940	button. Oh, very funny, very funny. Oh, it spells out dead. Do you like metal? Does baby metal
18896940	18910060	count as metal? I like OST from Doom. Doom? Yeah, Doom 2007, BFG is probably my favorite,
18910060	18915180	if that counts as metal song. Has everyone got the key? If you got the key, come up the hallway a
18915180	18919580	little bit. Oh wait, we're, oh no, we're supposed to go back. Okay, if you've got the key, come out
18919580	18927580	of the room. Let's see if there's any, who's not got the key? Got the key, got the key.
18930620	18934140	Someone's, I don't know if someone's in that cutscene with the guy.
18936300	18944460	Spelled dead on the piano from the left side. Is that Hatsune Miku? It's Hatsune Miku. Hello guys,
18945020	18952380	my name is Hatsune Miku. I'm thinking Miku, Miku. There's a refling here, but I don't know if
18952380	18964700	they're in a cutscene or not, I'm not sure. I don't know what's happening with this refling,
18964700	18972940	I think they might be AFK, but everyone, oh, I don't know. Miku, you're, Miku, you're mine.
18975660	18982220	I think so. Okay, I think so, you're hanging out with us. I don't know, oh, oh, did you get the key?
18984300	18989500	Do you need to do the piano bit? I don't know. Oh right, spell dead on the piano and then search
18989500	18992940	the piano. And left side spell dead, if that makes sense.
18996300	19001980	Damn, there's no cheer remote. There is in game. Wait, where is it? Cheer, cheer. Okay,
19001980	19008300	that's the best I got. Sorry, I was AFK, I'll catch up. Yeah, just spell, yeah, yeah, there you go,
19008300	19015500	you got it, you got the key. If you touch the piano and then on left spell side and then you
19015500	19022540	should get key. I think everyone's got the key. Yippee, everyone's got the key, right, let's go.
19022540	19025980	Come back inside the house from the side, we blew it up on the powder keg.
19027100	19030780	Oh, it's a room full of reflings. Oh no, just me in a room full of reflings.
19033340	19037020	Okay, come back into the entrance hallway. Oh, we're getting stuck on the door.
19037900	19046220	Hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh, right, hold on. You again! It's him, it's him that's doing it.
19047260	19051500	It's him that's doing it, I'm getting freaking stuck. Wait, how'd that come around?
19052620	19059980	I literally can't progress. Stop it, I can't even get through. Or is it one by one? Oh,
19059980	19063980	maybe a one by one, hold on. I might be accusing someone of closing the door and I think it's one
19063980	19069900	by one. Oh, right, oh, sorry, sorry, I just, I'm sorry, refling. Miss input, miss input!
19071500	19078780	Oh, it's a miss input, okay. Shawnee letting her imagination run wild. Honestly, honestly?
19080140	19083340	Okay, so one by one door, take your time, take your time, it's one by one door.
19084300	19087820	Right, here we come. Stop, refling! Let us come in.
19093260	19097260	Everyone's got a better ping than me! Okay, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
19100540	19107020	Okay, then through the other one by one door. Oh, it's a cutscene. Accusing her own
19107580	19112220	beloved loyal refling. Why am I the only one always left cleaning up after everyone?
19113100	19121900	Shuffle? Hello, anyone there? Russell? Hello, Lacey said. Scratch.
19123580	19131260	Hmm, well I guess I should go check it out. No point saying in this nice locked room when I could
19131260	19137580	go outside into the creepy darkness. Seriously? The walls and doors seem too thick for Mandy to
19137580	19143340	be able to hear you. Oh, and I don't think there is any need to take this big shiny
19143340	19149020	weapon with me in order to defend myself. Nothing bad ever happens when people go check out noises
19149020	19156300	in the dark outside the house. You have gotta be kidding. Okay, well here I go.
19156700	19163820	Bando Scotsword. Hello, anyone out here?
19166780	19170940	See, I knew nothing would happen. Must have just been a squirrel or something running about.
19176220	19179660	Oh well, back to the dishes. Phew, that was lucky.
19180540	19184060	Oh, he's behind you!
19187180	19193420	No, why me? That psycho. He was just toying with her.
19195340	19200620	Oh, we're getting left another note, I think. Is this talk to killer? Just look at what we can.
19200620	19206780	We're in a cutscene. And he's hiding away again. Another note, this guy really likes playing games,
19206780	19213500	but this is going to be the game he won't win. Okay, there should be a note on the ground for us
19213500	19222700	to read now. Here, at first, these words. Each murder you witness helplessly from start to end
19222700	19228860	as you fail to solve the final letters of this quiz. Razor sharp like a gemstone is the blade of my
19228860	19236620	knife. The last sound you hear will be your screams echo. Hita, I will have the final word
19236700	19248780	in this thriller. Okay, we need to go back into the hallway on the one-by-one door, so we need to be patient.
19248780	19264140	I'm standing and lying. I was looking in soft lock by a door. Okay, there we go, I made it through.
19266060	19273900	Wait, what was that? Oh, that makes sense. Is there a refland just out there chilling?
19273900	19277100	Are you not doing the quiz? Are you just bing-chilling out there? Bing-chilling.
19279740	19280940	Are you not sure what to do?
19284380	19287740	Okay, and then one-by-one, we painfully go through this door again.
19289500	19296300	Now we're getting waving hello, hello. Okay, we need to check out the fireplace. Okay, or also known as the heart.
19296300	19302220	Oh wait, this is chopped on tree. Examine the fireplace with a knife. Use the knife on the fireplace.
19303660	19307980	You use the knife to pry open a loose brick in the fireplace, revealing a secret panel
19309500	19315180	Search fireplace. You find a panel of switches inside the hidden compartment.
19315180	19318060	Each switch is crafted from a different gemstone.
19318620	19341580	Click sapphire. Click diamonds. Click zanyate. Click emerald. Click on it. Then click ruby.
19342300	19346300	Blue, white, orange, green, black, red.
19348220	19352700	You hear a click sound. You find a hidden key. Okay, that one's a bit more.
19354620	19362220	SD, Z, E, autumn. How are you supposed to figure that out? I love riddles in this game.
19362220	19368140	Must have been the wind. Would you be upset if it was ink you were cleaning instead?
19369100	19371980	Oh man, I can't believe this. I can't find my old character anymore.
19371980	19378940	I wanted to bring in a high-level character to help out. I don't worry. Also, there's a boss fight now.
19381180	19385900	I don't have any combat. The final letters of the note.
19385900	19398540	Oh, I have the final word in this form.
19401100	19407660	Okay, okay, that's actually wee bit smart. I'll give it a wee bit smart.
19407660	19412460	Just a wee bit. One by one door. One by one door.
19412460	19417100	One by one door. One by one. Cheeky one by one. Oh wait, is everyone done with the hearth?
19417100	19418620	God, you guys were so quick at the hearth.
19421340	19425180	Okay, Cheeky. Cheeky one by one door. That's it. Let me in.
19425180	19428940	Stop! You don't even need to come in this room. You've already done the quest.
19428940	19434700	Bruv, I don't have high enough ping. I can't get out. I actually don't have high enough ping
19434700	19441500	to get out. I'm not even being funny. My ping is so bad. I can't get out. Bruv.
19443420	19447900	I don't know what to do. My ping isn't fast enough to respond.
19450140	19454860	The background keeps reminding me of the godfather. I've never seen the godfather. Is it gay?
19456540	19463900	Fail to solve the final letters of this quiz. Fail to solve the- Ah, okay, okay. Oh, okay, it works.
19464460	19467500	Okay. Alright, in you go.
19467980	19472380	Right, once we're back in the engine's way, we one by one on the door over here.
19473020	19474220	We're spinning on the door.
19478060	19482140	Let's refling. Here we go. And then we go. Boom.
19485740	19491260	We got a cutscene. I wonder if there's a way to make the text bigger.
19491260	19492540	Show yourself, you coward.
19493260	19496220	Monkey. Monkey, is someone gonna get stuff?
19500300	19504460	So, we meet at last. I have to say, I'm impressed you worked out my riddles. Well,
19504460	19509340	maybe you aren't as smart as you think you are. Or really, all the dead bodies suggest otherwise.
19509900	19516620	And what did you do to stop them? Nothing. People think you are some big hero, but no,
19516620	19522140	you're not. All your adventures are the same. Nothing but opportunists. What are you on about?
19522140	19525820	Well, I did have this big speech planned out, but quite frankly,
19525820	19528460	I don't think you're worth the effort it would take to deliver it.
19529420	19533340	So, this is the end of the line for you. It is time for the final act.
19533340	19537740	The showdown. The finale. Let's see if you're up for the challenge.
19541500	19548140	Probably not. I'm too- Ah, if I die, do I lose all the money that's on my hand? Push mirror.
19553100	19556300	The mirror can't be pushed any further. What are you on about?
19559100	19563500	Oh no, I missed. Wait, is there like a timer?
19565900	19572780	Hello? Oh. Logic puzzle? Wait, do I need to like-
19572780	19578380	Do it all the time? Wait, hold on. Push. And then push. And then push from here.
19578380	19586780	Boom. Oh, what? He changed. I don't know which one he's coming from.
19589820	19590860	Did I just have to guess?
19593900	19596620	Oh, for goodness- Wait, I can't see when it's coming.
19599900	19605500	Is it that one? I think I'm too. Like, can you just randomize to this one where I've already
19605500	19612380	said it all? Please, that'd be great game. Wait, I'm supposed to run about that fast?
19613180	19617820	I don't think I'm that fast. I'm fricking too late.
19619900	19624860	And- Oh, right. Okay, there's like a weird shadow thing, but I don't know if I'm that fast.
19624860	19629100	Seriously. I'm not that fast! Oh.
19629980	19645180	Bruv. Did I just need to camp at one? He's too fast! Oh my god, he's like so fast!
19647820	19653980	Hold on. Oh, please be it. Oh no!
19654940	19664060	Oh, right, okay. Wait, I don't even know where it's coming from. Oh, right, okay. Shadow, shadow.
19665100	19668380	Okay, he's doing it again from that one. Okay, okay. Quick, quick, quick!
19671340	19676700	Is it- Oh, shit, I'm too- Please be this one. No!
19677980	19682220	The randomizer is so cruel. You know for a fact you can randomize elsewhere.
19683180	19689740	Okay, another one, another one. Oh, dang right out. All right, okay, okay, okay,
19689740	19699660	we can do this, we can do this. One, two, and three. Oh, just in time. Oh, we did it.
19704220	19707740	I flopped out. Oh, I think I may have underestimated you.
19708540	19716140	You lost at your own game and now it is time to see who you really are under that mask.
19719420	19724620	Wait, no, you, but why? Why on earth would you kill all your pals? Why beg me to come here and help
19724620	19732540	them? You just don't get it, do you? So big-headed, so used to it all being about you, about saving the
19732540	19738220	day. Well, I'm sick of it. What do you even mean? Adventurers, you're all the same. Everything
19738220	19743260	always has to be about you. I don't understand. Of course you wouldn't, because you can't see
19743260	19751420	past yourself. Believe it or not, I used to be like- Okay, at least to be like you, I hear about
19751420	19758860	some dance alone distress and go to help. Have my moment for me to be the hero for once. But you,
19758940	19763420	you and every other adventurer, every time I get there to help is too late.
19763420	19769260	It's already solved. The disaster is averted. Reward has already been claimed. Every time you
19769260	19775980	and those adventurers steal my moment, but not this time. This time, it's all about me. I'm the
19775980	19783180	star of the show. Me, me, me, me, me. Well, not any longer. The show's over and there will be no
19783180	19788300	curtain call. Oh, but there's always a curtain call. He he he he.
19792540	19794300	What? How? There was two?
19797980	19802300	Of course. Every good show needs a good support and actor. Now take off your mask, darling. Take
19802300	19809260	a bow. You've earned it. Of course, my love. It's Sid! No, it's not. It's Harvey. I'm sorry.
19810140	19814220	You, but how? You were almost heckin' gone. I saw your wounds.
19815580	19822060	No, what you watched was what I wanted you to watch. A masterful performance, if I say so myself.
19822060	19826940	But what's in it for you? Everyone loves the limelight and who better to share it with
19826940	19832700	them, my beloved Abigail. But your friends? They didn't deserve to perish.
19834060	19838860	Perhaps not, but neither did I deserve to be cast back into the shadows where I deserve the
19838860	19847580	spotlight. Yes, well, we deserve the spotlight. And now I have my starring role, our starring role.
19848540	19851660	Gelinor will forever remember this night and what I've done here.
19854140	19865340	No, what we have done. Quiet Huey, this is my moment. No, this is supposed to be our moment.
19866300	19869660	It isn't just all about you either. We're in this together.
19870460	19875580	Stop ruining this, Huey. I have worked so hard for this and I'm not gonna let you take it away from
19875580	19882860	me. Well, I'm not gonna be push aside either. We were both in on this as equals. We were never
19882860	19890860	equals. How could you possibly compare to me? You're egotistical, selfish. No, my love.
19891100	19901820	No, what have I done? It wasn't supposed to be like this, but you just couldn't let me have my
19901820	19910540	moment. Why, Huey, why? I loved you. This could be my chance to take advantage of the situation.
19911660	19917900	Okay, pick up the knife. I'm not going out of her empty-handed. Yeah, pick up, take the killer's knife.
19918460	19924860	Yonk and I'm not go- wait, equip the knife, pick up the knife and equip it and then stab her.
19925820	19933180	Take that, hack and slash. Well, thanks Sarah Domen. That's over. I should get out of here.
19935260	19942060	Just like that. Are they still alive? I don't think he's in a very talkative mood. Are they both?
19942060	19945740	Okay. Okay, let's get out of here. Let's get out. Let's get out.
19948220	19952540	The crying says, you'll never escape me.
19954940	19963340	You dare try and ruin- wait, what? NPC spot? Isn't she supposed to be parish? Try and ruin my moment.
19963340	19971260	Oh, wait, no. Huey is hurt because of you. It's definitely to you. Oh, wait. Now it's time for
19971260	19976700	you to join. Oh, you're not killing anyone else. Oh, again, absolutely. She's spanked by the-
19979580	19983580	No, this can't be. She just got specked. Whoa, that was close.
19984780	19990300	Mandy, how are you alive? I watched you get shanked. I did get stabbed, but I was born with a rare
19990300	19999500	condition called Dextrocardia. Dextrocardia what? Dextrocardia. It means that my heart is on the
19999500	20004460	right side of my chest, not my left. Oh, that's so specific. So when the killers thought they stabbed
20004460	20009660	you in the heart, they actually missed? Well, missed the heart, yeah. I did still get stabbed,
20009660	20015900	though. I'm actually feeling pretty woozy. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. I will wait outside the house
20015900	20020940	after seeing to this stab wound. You should come talk to me there. Okay, okay, okay.
20021660	20029260	Hey, right, outside the house if my- Oh, no, are you guys stuck on the mirror section?
20031100	20034620	Are they stuck on the mirror section if they're still in here? Or are they just in the cutscene?
20036860	20040540	Someone throw in their snowball. I'm starting to think you aren't throwing snowballs anymore.
20040540	20044700	No witnesses, the roofling's never taught. My medieval fantasy game with medieval-
20044700	20050380	Oh, my medieval fantasy game with medical term. There's still one more roofling stuck in there.
20051900	20057020	Are you stuck on the mirror quest, beyond it? I'm on team finish faster than throwing it. I need to
20057020	20070620	read it out. I don't think these are snowballs I'm getting covered in or something. Should I have
20070620	20077260	fought Abigail? You pick up a knife. Oh, did you just leave? You might have to go back inside
20077260	20081100	and redo that mirror section sadly. Whoa, wait, it's okay.
20085260	20090620	I mean, did you shank her? All right. Oh, the roofling's out. Is that everyone?
20091980	20098220	All the candles floor, all aboard. Oh, we're talking about humors and bail there.
20100620	20103820	Okay, that's all the rooflings. Everyone into the entrance way.
20104620	20110300	Turns out you can't fight her. Nah, you don't actually hurt Abigail yourself.
20111740	20115900	Right, and then we talk. Oh, no, it's one by one door. Oh, it's our biggest enemy. It's
20115900	20123500	literally our biggest enemy right now, one by one door. The game's like sending me away.
20124140	20130140	Right, I'll wait for the rooflings to go first. I'll let the rooflings go because they've been
20130620	20136620	playing with me without having a go time. No witnesses, the rooflings will never talk.
20137180	20142780	Fair and square. The actual end boss of the game. I don't think there's snowballs either,
20142780	20150620	but they may contain some terms in common. All done. Okay, we need to talk to the
20150620	20155900	Mandy right here. Oh, hi, Scottlefish. Hi, Mandy. How are you feeling now? Much better.
20155900	20160460	Thanks and lucky to be alive. Thanks to you. No small part. Well, we saved the day in the
20160460	20165260	team, so thank you too. Here, I found this in the wardrobe. I don't want to take it,
20165260	20173740	so please take it. We did it! We got another quest for level eight crafting and we got rubies for
20173740	20182380	it. I like that. Well, I think we're ready to go back. Is everyone ready once you've collected
20182380	20190380	your mission? The question is, what quest do we do now? We'll do the free quests.
20192380	20195660	I'm level nine crafting. I went, oh yeah, you're just rubbing in my face.
20198300	20202700	Looks like everyone's spoken to Mandy, almost. A few more wheat funds.
20205740	20211500	Someone's really enjoying just talking to all the wood. Is that everyone? I'm just trying to check.
20212700	20220700	Are you coming too? No? Yeah, no, maybe. Right, all aboard the boat.
20224060	20228860	Who do I talk to to finish the quest? Mandy, she's outside that castle.
20230220	20234540	Yeah, we did it! We did it! Wait, wait, let me do a celebration of moat. Can I jump in the air?
20235500	20236700	We completed the quest!
20245180	20252140	Okay, I think we should go to the bank
20253500	20258060	and put all our items away and then we'll pick what quest to do next. What's a free quest?
20258060	20263580	That's easy. Goblin Diplomacy is pretty easy.
20263580	20269260	Erin is the chicken. I think you need to have combat. I think you need combat for Erin.
20269980	20272140	Sleep well, good night, those who have to go.
20275100	20281100	Good night, Trony. We'll see you there, Bessa. Until later, I don't know if there's anything easy.
20281100	20283740	Erin is the chicken. It's probably the easiest we've got right now.
20284700	20289820	I think we need to level up, so that's not only why we need to level up.
20290860	20292220	Just a runaway segment.
20294700	20296620	All kind. It's all the refunds here.
20303100	20305180	Yeah, I've got some stuff to do. Try not to get food.
20305180	20308700	For those who have to go, don't worry if you have to go. Understand, it's not possible.
20308700	20313020	We'll do Erin is the chicken and then we're going to go back to fishing.
20313100	20315260	Sorry, we're going to go back to leveling up cooking.
20318860	20320940	Okay, is everyone here? I think everyone's here.
20322140	20324700	I don't know if that other refling is still stuck on the island.
20325900	20330620	Possibly. That went crazy. Didn't we just see him back on this island?
20332940	20335420	Wait, there is a refling that got stuck on that quest? I think.
20336380	20337500	It's called scrawny sea.
20339980	20343500	Oh no, that was a good thing. Okay, see you later. Bye bye refling.
20343500	20347020	Thank you for joining for the ones who have to leave. Don't worry if you have to leave in game.
20347580	20351820	Right, if you want to follow me, if you hover on me, it should say follow.
20353100	20356940	And then I'll take you to the bank and then we'll do Erin is the chicken.
20356940	20358700	I don't know what is, but we'll do it anyway.
20359500	20361660	Oh, I'll walk. Sorry, I'll walk. I always forget to walk.
20362860	20364540	We've got a refling army, honestly.
20365980	20370940	See you later alligator in a wild crocodile.
20372380	20375900	Yeah, I want to, I want to go to the island.
20376940	20381100	Why would you let me go? Did you guys see that Stephen Hawking meme?
20381100	20386380	That sounds really terrible, but that's what the meme was.
20387740	20390780	So when it came out that Stephen Hawking went on the island,
20390780	20394140	someone like did a quote and it was like, I want to go to the island.
20394140	20395180	Why won't you let me go?
20400140	20401500	Oh, I just love the brave word.
20402300	20405580	I know the stream isn't over yet, but when do you think the next runescape won?
20405580	20407500	Probably in a week's time.
20408220	20411500	My endurance stream is Skyrim for next week,
20412300	20415660	but I am going to try and get 99th cooking.
20415660	20416700	Where am I trying to go?
20416700	20419180	I don't know why I need the map to go to the bank and all the bankers.
20419820	20423260	My next, I'm going to try and finish 99 cooking.
20424140	20430220	In one month, I want to finish 99 cooking.
20431500	20432940	Bobby Lee or whatever.
20432940	20434060	Yeah, yeah, that was it.
20435100	20439260	No, it's just going to be vanilla Skyrim for my endurance stream next week.
20439260	20442140	Endurance stream next week is Skyrim and Runescape.
20443260	20446140	I don't think today we're going to do the full 12 hours
20446140	20448220	because I've actually done quite a lot of 12 hours.
20448220	20450060	Go upstairs on the top of the bank.
20450060	20451260	How are you everywhere?
20451260	20453500	Am I going crazy or is this a bot?
20453500	20456140	Or is this a leafling that like is just no,
20456140	20458460	like how are you leveling up outside here?
20458460	20459740	What we didn't even get here.
20460620	20461420	I'm going crazy.
20461420	20462540	I swear that's a leafling.
20463260	20463740	Right.
20463740	20465740	Empty everything inside.
20466780	20470700	I guess you can just drop the notes from that minigame.
20474060	20475340	And then Erin is the chicken.
20475340	20478460	I'm actually going to equip my sword and shield.
20478460	20481180	I'm pretty sure I got unequipped for some reason
20481180	20483180	and I don't want to be completely defenseless.
20483980	20484780	I'm not out there.
20484780	20487100	I think we just draw destroy you, I guess.
20491900	20494940	Wait, am I not allowed to destroy the notes?
20495660	20497100	They'll just put them in the bank then.
20497980	20499340	Okay, I'm just putting the notes in the bank.
20499340	20499980	I don't know why.
20500620	20501340	No, that's me.
20501340	20501820	All right.
20501820	20502700	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
20504300	20505500	I can just what I was like,
20505500	20507660	I'm sure that's a leafling genuinely.
20507660	20510060	Anyone want my three gems since I can't bank them?
20510060	20511580	Oh, me, me, me, me, me, me.
20511660	20513500	Send them to Mommy who said that.
20514300	20515420	Me, me, me, me, me, head a...
20515420	20516300	Ah, I can't trade you.
20516300	20516940	What?
20516940	20518060	Oh, I've only traded you?
20519900	20522060	Oh, well, at least you can send it to me at least.
20522060	20524380	Yeah, I dunno why I wouldn't want me to do that.
20524380	20526060	Me, me, me, me, me.
20526060	20527180	Oh, my god, my, my, my, my, no.
20529580	20533340	We should fight the level 152 chicken at the gate, ill.
20533340	20533980	Is that true?
20533980	20534620	Is that real?
20535260	20536220	I don't mean to alarm you,
20536220	20537740	but NaNNa and Cookin make take...
20537740	20540300	Someone said it can take 30 hours if we max it.
20541580	20546260	I can't trade for another 52 minutes, that's okay.
20546260	20554900	Err, right, erm, Ern is the chicken, we're gonna do Big Ernie the checkin' buck buck
20554900	20557180	er, show on the map.
20557180	20563180	We need to go, oooh, outside this location here.
20563180	20564660	I don't know, do we level up?
20564660	20567660	I feel like we need to do a bit of combat.
20568620	20575420	Well we go kill cows for like, I'm not even kidding, we'll go, er, kill cows for like,
20575420	20576420	five minutes.
20576420	20579980	So we're gonna go across the bridge and get cows.
20579980	20584460	Reeflings, come down to the castle, I'll wait for you at the front of the castle.
20584460	20589020	Make sure you have a sword and a shield equipped, did you got it from Tutorial Island.
20589020	20593460	A hundred hours are five strong streams of frogs in the lake!
20593460	20594460	Honestly.
20597900	20605500	Yeah, we go, right, we will just go outside the castello, er, and I'll make sure everyone,
20605500	20609460	I don't see anyone coming down the stairs from there, I think there's no one.
20609460	20614140	Everyone's on, you guys are quick, I don't think there's anyone, I don't see anyone.
20614140	20620500	Okay, we're gonna cross the bridge, five streams must be short ones, honestly, er, just five
20620500	20621500	streams.
20622340	20623340	Ugh.
20625340	20627340	Give me one second, I'm getting...
20627340	20629340	I'm not gonna do this.
20629340	20633340	Nine streams, one minute is like absolutely all of this.
20633340	20635340	I'm getting...
20637340	20639340	I'm getting a freaking seal, what?
20639340	20642340	I'm getting a big difference.
20642340	20643340	Ugh.
20643340	20645340	Okay, I can breathe again.
20646180	20652580	Right, we're gonna go into the cow's pen, and we're literally gonna go nuts in destroying
20652580	20654180	all these cows up ahead.
20654180	20662740	Okay, just so some people get nine in cooking by at skill 33 with 6,000 grapes and turning
20662740	20663740	them into wine.
20663740	20665580	Is that the fastest ice pee maker?
20665580	20668180	I thought it was sharks, but sharks are expensive.
20668180	20669180	Me.
20669180	20673180	Oh, someone wants to trade, sorry, sorry, I didn't see the offer.
20673180	20675180	What do you offer me?
20676020	20677020	Poison?
20677020	20679020	Are you telling me killing them?
20679020	20681020	Oh my God, what did you do?
20681020	20683020	Poison and fish food.
20683020	20684020	Reefland!
20684020	20686020	That's so mean!
20686020	20690020	I got given poison and freaking fish food.
20690020	20694020	Tell me, tell me you don't like me, without telling me you don't like me, Reefland.
20694020	20695020	Sheesh.
20695020	20699020	Right, let's absolutely destroy these cows.
20699020	20703780	Even if you just get a few, like to level up, I guess.
20703820	20706820	Even a tiny bit of a level up is better than nothing.
20706820	20709820	Something about not being able to burn wine?
20709820	20712820	Wine making's the fastest.
20712820	20713820	Okay.
20716820	20719820	Based Reefland, someone said.
20719820	20725820	Okay, just get the cows, just attack the cows at all willy nilly.
20725820	20732820	And then we can level up our combat a bit, because our combat is so low that we're like
20732860	20735860	really vulnerable to pretty much anything.
20735860	20737860	Destroy that Reefland.
20737860	20739860	Mods, slap them silly.
20739860	20741860	Mods, remove this man's chest.
20743860	20745860	Just cult things.
20747860	20749860	Why you following this noob?
20749860	20751860	Just cult things.
20751860	20753860	Okay, I love that answer.
20753860	20755860	Is there more cows over here?
20755860	20756860	Oh, there is!
20756860	20757860	There's like tons of cows.
20757860	20760860	Okay, and don't worry, you can attack everything in this field.
20760900	20762900	We'll just level up.
20762900	20764900	Oh, he said enjoy.
20766900	20768900	We will hunt them down.
20768900	20773900	Mods, put chewed up gum in this, in his best shoes.
20774900	20777900	Mods, make sure his pillow is always warm.
20779900	20780900	Yeah.
20780900	20782900	See, we're like literally already covered.
20782900	20784900	We're getting so strong.
20784900	20787900	We're just beating absolutely everything up.
20790900	20793900	Why did, actually, how did they know I'm a noob?
20793900	20794900	Is that the way I dress?
20794900	20799900	I'm literally wearing a thousand gold dreads, and they called me a noob.
20799900	20802900	Not to brag, but my combat level is five right now.
20802900	20807900	Like, I'm sorry, but runescape players quake when they see me.
20807900	20809900	I'm sorry, they just quake when they see me.
20809900	20810900	They can't help it.
20810900	20812900	Their timbers are shivered.
20812900	20815900	Whenever they see skullfish log in online.
20815900	20817900	Oh, I've only got four health.
20817900	20819900	I should maybe be a bit more careful, honestly.
20819940	20821940	Oh, I've only got three health.
20821940	20823940	Maybe I should be really careful.
20823940	20831940	Hmm, I'm not sure I can maybe fight the baby cows.
20831940	20835940	If I get beaten up by a cow, I'm going to be really embarrassed, okay?
20835940	20838940	Oh my god, a baby cow, destroy it.
20838940	20841940	Combat level five, literally.
20841940	20846940	We quiver before you as well, but for different reasons.
20849940	20854940	Oh my god, the way that we think rolls over as well is so sad.
20854940	20857940	I'm planting some booms.
20857940	20859940	All right.
20859940	20862940	I can only attack baby cows, because I've only got three HP.
20862940	20867940	I swear, if any reefling perishes against cows, I'm going to be embarrassed for result, okay?
20867940	20869940	Oh, sorry, someone said they wished to trade.
20869940	20870940	Sorry, sorry.
20870940	20873940	Let me beat up this baby cow, and then I'll accept the trade.
20873980	20877980	Wah, wah, wah.
20877980	20879980	Oh my god, I'm on one HP.
20879980	20881980	No way this baby cow is going to get me.
20881980	20883980	Mauds, are you...
20883980	20885980	I'm going to get killed by a baby cow.
20885980	20888980	I need to get out of the field, oh my god.
20888980	20890980	I'm one HP in a dream.
20890980	20892980	Hold on, right, let's try that again.
20892980	20896980	Okay, I literally am the one that's going to perish from the cow.
20896980	20899980	Hold on, let me accept this trade.
20899980	20901980	I'm so sorry.
20902020	20904020	Chin up, offer?
20906020	20908020	Oh no, can you not trade?
20908020	20910020	That's okay if you can't do it in time.
20910020	20914020	Uh, I guess we'll just hang about here, yeah?
20914020	20915020	We're just going to hang about...
20915020	20917020	Oh, they're cooking meat.
20917020	20919020	Cannot trade, yeah, I'm a new account.
20919020	20921020	It's because I'm not cleaning up.
20921020	20923020	Do you have meat?
20923020	20925020	Excuse me, little reefling.
20925020	20928020	Uh, can I get some of your meat?
20928060	20932060	Please, one bit of meat so I can heal.
20934060	20936060	Just one meat.
20936060	20937060	Oh, you not got any?
20937060	20939060	I saw you cooking though.
20940060	20942060	I do not have any.
20942060	20946060	Oh wait, I can make some if I pick up some off the ground.
20946060	20949060	Wait a minute, hold on a minute, I can do it my...
20949060	20951060	I'm an independent strummer.
20951060	20954060	Use the meat on the fire and then eat the meat.
20954060	20956060	It's genius.
20956100	20957100	I did it!
20957100	20960100	Okay, we can go back to slay and let's go.
20960100	20963100	We'll get a few more combat levels like this.
20963100	20966100	Chicken's going to only hit zero, so that's good for you, accounts.
20966100	20969100	No, we need a challenge for the coup.
20974100	20976100	Uh, we're now attack level four.
20976100	20978100	Oh my god, we're getting too strong.
20978100	20980100	We can't handle this.
20980100	20982100	When we enter the lobby...
20982100	20985100	I'm going to actually cook again because I want to heal up.
20986100	20987100	GGG.
20987100	20990100	I'm gaming so hard right now.
20990100	20992100	Oh no, I burnt it!
20992100	20996100	I thought we were high enough level not to burn level one me, honestly.
21000100	21002100	I don't know what combat level we are.
21002100	21004100	We're combat level five.
21004100	21006100	Surely that's enough for questing.
21006100	21007100	Surely.
21007100	21009100	Copium.
21009100	21012100	Let me know wild strong, you can survive in nature.
21012100	21015100	It's rough out in nature, it's rough.
21016100	21020100	I just need to heal and then I can start walloping everything again.
21020100	21022100	There, boom.
21022100	21028100	Uh, let me keep the attack or is it better to like swap between like the same thing, so...
21028100	21030100	Cows can burn.
21030100	21032100	It's genius!
21032100	21035100	Shit over here.
21035100	21039100	Why do the farmers randomly let you perish their cows?
21039100	21042100	Honestly, I'm not even sure.
21042140	21050140	Wait, I think it might be faster to do like strength and then I might get like a combat level faster.
21050140	21051140	I'm not sure if that's right though.
21051140	21054140	I could be completely wrong about that.
21054140	21057140	Wait, there's like more cows over here, we can use annihilate.
21057140	21059140	Yeah, there's like tons over here.
21062140	21064140	Best to train strength.
21064180	21070180	Alright, maybe defense because like I've not got much HP points.
21070180	21072180	Like I only got 10.
21072180	21074180	Oh sorry, someone wishes to trade with me.
21074180	21078180	Drop some meat over here if you want to strong any things I can't trade.
21078180	21080180	The reeflings feeding me.
21080180	21082180	Oh, they're feeding me.
21082180	21084180	Thank you reeflings.
21084180	21086180	That's a lot of meat.
21086180	21088180	Jeez, you're a packin.
21088180	21090180	Is that six whole meat for me?
21090180	21092180	It is, thank you.
21092220	21094220	Am I baiting to it?
21094220	21096220	Oh wait, I'm already full health.
21096220	21098220	Wait, I only have 9 HP?
21098220	21100220	No, I have 10 HP, that's like tiny.
21100220	21102220	Azura remainder.
21102220	21104220	Azura duly is going live.
21104220	21106220	I'm unsure what game she's playing.
21108220	21110220	Oh my god, check out the outfit.
21110220	21112220	Check out the drip.
21112220	21114220	Let's say drip out in the color scheme.
21114260	21116260	We're getting there, we're getting there.
21116260	21118260	Surely.
21118260	21120260	Oh my god, do you know what that reminds me of?
21120260	21122260	I think the reason why I laugh so much at that
21122260	21124260	is because of this.
21124260	21126260	Right, hear me out.
21126260	21128260	Hear me out.
21128260	21130260	Where is it?
21130260	21132260	Let me find it.
21132260	21134260	I think that's why that makes me laugh so much.
21134260	21136260	Because it looks so good.
21136260	21138260	Oh my god.
21138300	21140300	Let me find it.
21140300	21142300	I think that's why
21142300	21144300	that makes me laugh so much.
21144300	21146300	Because it looks so ridiculous.
21146300	21148300	That's the only reason I like the headbanging
21148300	21150300	the most.
21152300	21154300	This is absolutely ridiculous.
21160300	21162300	Wow.
21162300	21164300	I don't know.
21164300	21166300	Is level 6 combat enough to not get attacked
21166340	21168340	all the time?
21168340	21170340	Sorry, I look sussy.
21170340	21172340	Sorry, I said that wrong.
21172340	21174340	I don't mean to say it like that.
21174340	21176340	Oh, I'm level 2 strength.
21176340	21178340	Check me out.
21178340	21180340	Oh sorry, someone wants to trade with me.
21180340	21182340	I'm sorry, I missed it.
21182340	21184340	I'm too fatigued.
21184340	21186340	I'm too enthralled
21186340	21188340	with perishing these cows to get some level ups.
21188340	21190340	Very beefy.
21190340	21192340	I'm sorry.
21192340	21194340	Look, I've got things on my mind, you know.
21194380	21196380	Are the marshmallows up again recently?
21196380	21198380	Oh yeah.
21198380	21200380	Hee hee hee.
21202380	21204380	Okay.
21204380	21206380	Accept trade.
21206380	21208380	What? Show me what you got.
21208380	21210380	Oh, it's a strength potion
21210380	21212380	and cooked salmon.
21212380	21214380	Okay.
21214380	21216380	I don't know how long.
21216380	21218380	I only wanted to be here for like a wee bit
21218380	21220380	and then we'll go straight back in
21220380	21222380	to leveling up cooking.
21222420	21224420	I accidentally save questing a little too much.
21224420	21226420	What I wanted to do was get some levels.
21226420	21228420	So when we do airness to chicken,
21228420	21230420	we don't all perish.
21230420	21232420	I think we can run away
21232420	21234420	for whatever is going on.
21234420	21236420	Oh yeah, you know all right.
21236420	21238420	Hee hee hee hee.
21238420	21240420	I just didn't want us to perish
21240420	21242420	really quickly when we did airness to chicken.
21242420	21244420	I don't know what Azur is live with.
21247420	21249420	Thank you very much, Refling,
21249420	21251420	for all the food supplies as well.
21251460	21253460	Um.
21253460	21255460	Almost like up my strength.
21255460	21257460	Level up, level up.
21257460	21259460	Ooh.
21259460	21261460	Combat level six, unstoppable.
21261460	21263460	Truly unstoppable.
21263460	21265460	They cannot, they cannot.
21265460	21267460	Strength potion for stronger.
21267460	21269460	Ah.
21269460	21271460	Okay, I took a sip.
21271460	21273460	I don't know how long it lasts.
21273460	21275460	Wait, where's the effect?
21275460	21277460	I don't know how long these things,
21277460	21279460	the pots last.
21279500	21281500	Ooh.
21281500	21283500	I've cast up this much of a fate.
21283500	21285500	I fear what bulls are capable of.
21285500	21287500	She can now destroy baby cows with ease.
21287500	21289500	I truly am evil.
21289500	21291500	Truly.
21291500	21293500	I don't know how long it lasts.
21295500	21297500	Strength potion, yeah.
21297500	21299500	Top left the fist.
21299500	21301500	So the strength boosts.
21303500	21305500	60 seconds?
21305500	21307500	No, it does not last.
21307540	21309540	It lasts 60 seconds.
21309540	21311540	It's so small when you heal.
21311540	21313540	Oh, salmon heals a lot, actually.
21313540	21315540	We need to start like a salmon ring.
21317540	21319540	Is it normal to heal multiple,
21319540	21321540	strong voices simultaneously in my head?
21321540	21323540	I hope not. If I left the echo on.
21326540	21328540	One boosted start point,
21328540	21330540	dreams every 30 seconds.
21330540	21332540	That's so quick.
21332540	21334540	Ooh.
21334540	21336540	I'm no strength level four.
21336580	21338580	I'm rolling these cows.
21338580	21340580	There's no echo.
21340580	21342580	Okay.
21342580	21344580	It's just a reef flings finally losing the plot.
21344580	21346580	I now can have a live in HP.
21346580	21348580	Okay, maybe we should have done
21348580	21350580	a bit of training a wee bit earlier.
21350580	21352580	But look, we're leveling up.
21352580	21354580	That's the main thing.
21354580	21356580	We're getting there.
21356580	21358580	I don't know if we should maybe go for like
21358580	21360580	five.
21362580	21364580	Hmm.
21364620	21366620	I'm thinking he's becoming an extra strongy pill.
21366620	21369620	So it depends on how strong your potion has boosted you.
21369620	21372620	Azure is playing one shot.
21372620	21374620	Like how strong he sounds excited
21374620	21376620	every time she unlocks levels.
21376620	21378620	It's so satisfying.
21378620	21380620	It's like, you've unlocked a new level,
21380620	21382620	but yeah, I have.
21382620	21384620	I'm such a big girl.
21384620	21386620	I'm so smart.
21386620	21388620	It's MRT.
21388620	21390620	Hmm.
21390620	21392620	Hydration check.
21392660	21394660	I think the echo effect,
21394660	21396660	if I was playing a video game,
21396660	21398660	doesn't sound that good.
21398660	21400660	Like, this is, for example,
21400660	21402660	what would sound like,
21402660	21404660	oh, I'm just killing this dude right now.
21404660	21406660	It just sounds mental.
21406660	21408660	It sounds like you've lost the plot.
21408660	21410660	You've actually lost the plot.
21410660	21412660	It's not sounding good, you know?
21412660	21414660	There.
21414660	21416660	That should be it back to me.
21416660	21418660	I think I got unsubtremised
21418660	21420660	channel. It's very plausible.
21420700	21422700	I think it should be in
21422700	21424700	my description.
21424700	21426700	Right, we'll do
21426700	21428700	five defense.
21428700	21430700	We're almost level seven combat.
21430700	21432700	Let's go.
21432700	21434700	Oh my god, Serenity!
21436700	21438700	How are you doing? How was your stream?
21438700	21440700	Even though you'll probably be exhausted
21440700	21442700	and the last thing you want to do
21442700	21444700	is get a ton of heck in comments
21444700	21446700	and be like, I'm not making a stream.
21446700	21448700	I don't know.
21448740	21450740	How, hopefully it was good though
21450740	21452740	and you had fun. Hi Raiders!
21452740	21454740	I'm Strony Cuttles from Veiler
21454740	21456740	and I'm currently doing
21456740	21458740	my stream snipe game of the day,
21458740	21460740	of the week, sorry.
21460740	21462740	We're playing old-school Rinscape.
21462740	21464740	We're in World 3a, which is free to play
21464740	21466740	and we're just leveling up our accounts a little bit
21466740	21468740	because we are super weak
21468740	21470740	and I'm scared to
21470740	21472740	send us quests, because someone might fall down.
21474740	21476740	What level is your attack?
21476780	21478780	My attack is four.
21478780	21480780	Strength is five and defense is one.
21480780	21482780	I'm currently doing defense right now.
21482780	21484780	Just to try and get
21484780	21486780	overall combat level.
21486780	21488780	Speedy Bun Raid.
21488780	21490780	I never saw Rinscape before.
21490780	21492780	Oh, it's basically
21492780	21494780	an incremental game
21494780	21496780	and you just click.
21496780	21498780	Literally, this is the graphics.
21498780	21500780	I'm not even kidding, check me out.
21500780	21502780	I've got a gold plated chef's hat on.
21502780	21504780	Gold apron on.
21504820	21506820	You've not seen anything bear.
21506820	21508820	Just amazing.
21508820	21510820	It's a sweetie bun raid.
21510820	21512820	Bun bun raid.
21514820	21516820	Help, I've fallen.
21516820	21518820	I'm literally dropped out.
21518820	21520820	Why did I get a message?
21520820	21522820	I'll be logged in in 30 minutes.
21522820	21524820	But yeah, we're just leveling up
21524820	21526820	because
21526820	21528820	we want to do some questions.
21528820	21530820	That's weird.
21530820	21532820	I always saw the YouTube make up
21532860	21534860	that's not the default graphics.
21534860	21536860	Oh, at least even worse
21536860	21538860	than this.
21538860	21540860	Oh, it's been six hours
21540860	21542860	already. I didn't realize either.
21542860	21544860	Sorry for stealing all your time, guys.
21544860	21547860	Time flies when you're having fun.
21547860	21549860	Time flies.
21549860	21551860	This is peak graphics.
21551860	21553860	You do not get better than this.
21553860	21555860	The year is 2024.
21555860	21557860	Let's admire
21557860	21559860	the daisies right here.
21559860	21561860	Let's zoom in a little.
21561900	21563900	Look at these, man.
21563900	21565900	Beautiful.
21565900	21567900	You can see every poly...
21567900	21569900	What's that, a poly thing?
21569900	21571900	Every triangle.
21571900	21573900	Oh.
21573900	21575900	All the triangles are made out.
21578900	21580900	Oh, I've reached
21580900	21582900	a total level of 100.
21582900	21584900	Ooh, our accounts are getting bear.
21584900	21586900	We've
21586900	21588900	started on fresh accounts.
21588940	21590940	So, all that got censored.
21590940	21592940	It did.
21592940	21594940	Hold on, let me eat a salmon.
21594940	21596940	Well, we're at combat level 7.
21596940	21598940	Oh, we are getting potent.
21598940	21600940	Okay.
21600940	21602940	Polygon, that's what I meant.
21602940	21604940	Yeah, polygon.
21604940	21606940	But if anyone looks as funny,
21606940	21608940	I'm gonna get them.
21608940	21610940	Level 7, go and get them.
21610940	21612940	They can't handle.
21612940	21614940	They can't handle it.
21614940	21616940	Laracraft,
21616980	21618980	honestly.
21618980	21620980	Okay, think
21620980	21622980	we're getting there, we're getting there.
21622980	21624980	Maybe we do 5 on each.
21624980	21626980	Eat combat means
21626980	21628980	we can survive a little bit of a hit.
21628980	21630980	A little bit of a punch, if you will.
21630980	21632980	Triangle.
21632980	21634980	Oh, that should have been...
21634980	21636980	Is there a other name?
21638980	21640980	Yeah, we tricked everything.
21640980	21642980	Wow.
21642980	21644980	And then wherever Ernie's chicken starts,
21645020	21647020	I'm actually unsure.
21649020	21651020	Wow, level 4.
21651020	21653020	Did I put my combat?
21653020	21655020	We're at 7.6 for combat.
21655020	21657020	I like how it shows you the increment as well.
21657020	21659020	To be like, you're getting closer.
21659020	21661020	I'm pretty sure prayer counts
21661020	21663020	to your overall combat level as well.
21663020	21665020	So, I hit Fondle of Triangles.
21668020	21670020	So, I don't know if we should do some...
21670020	21672020	I've never done...
21672020	21674020	Is it the altar?
21674060	21676060	Dragon bone altar run, but they're so expensive.
21676060	21678060	And I would need personal guards
21678060	21680060	all the way over.
21683060	21685060	See, that's the fastest way
21685060	21687060	to level up prayer, I believe.
21687060	21689060	But yeah.
21689060	21691060	Watching Stronny and Emile and Spirits
21691060	21693060	playing a game on my own almost feels like
21693060	21695060	I have a friend.
21695060	21697060	Isn't there no sensory overload doing that?
21697060	21699060	I feel like
21699060	21701060	I'd be like, I couldn't handle it.
21701060	21703060	I feel like there's too much going on.
21704060	21706060	Is Emi enjoying her game so far?
21714060	21716060	I already need a P again.
21716060	21718060	I feel like whenever I have a T,
21718060	21720060	she's loving it, oh, I'm glad.
21720060	21722060	That's what I like to hear.
21722060	21724060	See, I knew a picture.
21724060	21726060	Oh, I'm level 4 health.
21726060	21728060	Sorry, 4 HP.
21728060	21730060	I think
21730060	21732060	there's everyone at least level...
21732100	21734100	So we've got level 6 refling.
21734100	21736100	Yeah, that's good.
21736100	21738100	Okay, apparently we get
21738100	21740100	level 5 in attack.
21740100	21742100	We're getting leveled up.
21742100	21744100	We've got level 10 refling over there.
21744100	21746100	I can't tell.
21746100	21748100	We've got level 6 as well.
21748100	21750100	Yeah, we're getting a bit better.
21750100	21752100	Getting a bit better.
21752100	21754100	We're definitely not to be tripled with
21754100	21756100	even though we're not level 10 combat yet.
21756100	21758100	But we're not to be missed with.
21758100	21760100	How do you pee so much yet so little?
21760140	21763140	I know that caffeine makes you want to wee-wee all the time.
21763140	21765140	So I think it might be because I'm having
21765140	21767140	so much T's from my throat.
21768140	21769140	Yay!
21769140	21771140	We're like doing little mini tasks as well.
21777140	21779140	Someone wants to trade.
21779140	21781140	You wish to trade. I accept your trade.
21781140	21783140	What do you wish to trade me?
21783140	21786140	Oh, I don't know if I can wear this, actually.
21786140	21788140	I don't know if it's too...
21788180	21789180	strong.
21789180	21791180	Like, I can't wear it yet.
21792180	21795180	I trade absolutely nothing.
21795180	21797180	Oh no, I took my apron off.
21797180	21800180	Oh my god, I have to pick between drip or function.
21800180	21802180	I think I have to pick between drip.
21802180	21804180	I'm so sorry.
21804180	21806180	Do you want your steel plate body back?
21808180	21810180	Sorry, the drip is for life.
21810180	21812180	For real, for real. The drip is for life.
21812180	21814180	I mean, check this out.
21814180	21816180	I mean, check it out.
21816220	21818220	It's so good. Okay, sure.
21818220	21820220	You want to trade with me?
21820220	21822220	I swear if it's more poison.
21822220	21824220	What is this? Crossbow?
21824220	21826220	Oh!
21828220	21830220	Whoa!
21830220	21832220	Wait, a pink skirt? Are you dressing me up?
21832220	21834220	I can't believe reeflings are dressing me up.
21834220	21836220	First cosplay stream confirmed.
21836220	21838220	Oh, look at the long drip.
21838220	21840220	I said Tee-hee.
21840220	21842220	I said Tee-hee, you're not getting Tee.
21842220	21844220	I put little crossbow ball tips on.
21844260	21846260	Whoa!
21846260	21848260	Okay, okay.
21848260	21850260	Wait, I think the skamar is better.
21850260	21852260	What is it called?
21852260	21854260	A steel skamar.
21854260	21856260	Okay.
21856260	21858260	I've got skamar.
21858260	21860260	I'm not afraid to use it.
21860260	21862260	Even in the game,
21862260	21864260	she has a dumpy, honestly.
21864260	21866260	The pencil dress.
21866260	21868260	Yeah, I mean, look at that.
21868260	21870260	Wow, look at them polygons.
21870260	21872260	Oh yeah, it's all coming together.
21872300	21874300	Great.
21874300	21876300	We will start airing as the chicken, I think.
21876300	21878300	Oh, there's an imp.
21878300	21880300	If I pick up a bead, I'm pretty sure.
21880300	21882300	Beat that imp up.
21882300	21884300	Or I'll beat it up.
21884300	21886300	Don't worry, I'll get it.
21886300	21888300	I don't want, I don't want because the cave's in the way.
21888300	21890300	Okay, now we beat the imp up.
21890300	21892300	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, beat him up.
21892300	21894300	If he drops a colored bead,
21894300	21896300	we can use it for the wizard quest.
21896300	21898300	I just realized I never killed it,
21898300	21900300	so I can't tell.
21901300	21903300	We'll never know what it dropped.
21903300	21905300	Oh wait, did it drop something?
21907300	21909300	Oh, it did!
21909300	21911300	Okay, we need it for the wizard tower quest,
21911300	21913300	but completely forgotten,
21913300	21915300	you need like four different components.
21917300	21920300	What are the consequences of death in this game?
21920300	21922300	I think you keep your three highest
21922300	21926300	priced items or something like that.
21926300	21928300	Right,
21928300	21931300	the three reflings are,
21931300	21933300	I'm going to stand at the gate,
21933300	21935300	and I'll wait for everyone to come over.
21935300	21938300	So if you want to stand outside the gate of the cow pen,
21938300	21940300	we will go do Ernest the chicken next,
21940300	21944300	and then we'll actually do some
21944300	21946300	cooking again,
21946300	21948300	because we're going to need a,
21948300	21950300	if we're wanting to wrap it up in a month,
21950300	21953300	I'm definitely going to need to stop getting so distracted.
21953300	21955300	We'll do some cooking.
21955300	21957300	Oh, the refling's out the pen.
21957300	21959300	And then I'll walk again.
21959300	21962300	Right, where the heck is Ernest the chicken?
21962300	21964300	Uh,
21969300	21971300	Starting off.
21971300	21972300	Four quest points.
21972300	21974300	Oh, that's the rewards.
21974300	21978300	Able to survive a skeleton level 22 attacking you.
21978300	21981300	Surely we're leveled up enough.
21981300	21983300	Surely.
21984300	21987300	Talk to Veronica outside of Draynor Manor.
21987300	21989300	Blah, where is it?
21989300	21991300	On the map.
21992300	21994300	Draynor Manor.
21994300	21996300	Draynor Village.
21996300	21998300	Oh, it was like outside that creepy place.
21998300	21999300	Yeah, here.
21999300	22000300	Okay, okay.
22000300	22002300	So how do we progress?
22002300	22003300	We go across the bridge,
22003300	22004300	and we go up,
22004300	22006300	and then we just keep going along,
22006300	22008300	and then we can go up again past the window.
22008300	22009300	Okay.
22009300	22011300	I shall take a breath and break.
22011300	22012300	Don't get me.
22012300	22013300	Oh, no.
22013300	22014300	Wait.
22014300	22015300	Okay.
22015300	22017300	If you want to follow me,
22017300	22019300	if you want to follow me refling,
22019300	22021300	is there anyone who's left behind?
22021300	22022300	You're not.
22022300	22024300	I don't recognize you as a refling.
22024300	22027300	There's a refling getting beaten up by a cow right now.
22027300	22029300	But reflings come outside the pen,
22029300	22031300	and you can follow me with a golden heart.
22031300	22033300	I crafted the schemata and shielded myself.
22033300	22035300	Heck yeah.
22035300	22040300	Not all the reflings like watching this one refling be up a cow.
22042300	22043300	I'm trying.
22044300	22046300	Don't actually worry if I get stuck.
22046300	22047300	I'll catch up.
22047300	22050300	Who is this Shirley you keep talking about?
22050300	22052300	It's me seeing Shirley.
22054300	22055300	Okay, there.
22055300	22056300	Refling.
22056300	22057300	Is there any other refling?
22057300	22058300	I don't know.
22058300	22060300	Render distance isn't helping.
22060300	22062300	I think that's just natural.
22062300	22063300	Okay, let's...
22063300	22064300	If you want to follow me,
22064300	22065300	I have the golden heart.
22065300	22068300	I'm going to be very careful with my pathing.
22068300	22070300	Maybe you can follow me.
22071300	22073300	Choo choo all aboard.
22078300	22079300	I made it to level four.
22079300	22080300	Wish me luck.
22080300	22081300	We're getting there.
22081300	22082300	We're getting there.
22082300	22085300	We'll definitely maybe do a bit of combat training.
22087300	22088300	But yeah.
22089300	22091300	All aboard.
22096300	22098300	I'll just kind of click one by one
22098300	22103300	to make sure we don't get any actually stuck on something.
22106300	22108300	How many reflings do we have in game?
22109300	22113300	I don't actually know how many.
22113300	22115300	We've had a few went offline
22115300	22117300	because we have hit the six hour mark.
22120300	22124300	But we do have a good amount of reflings all hanging out.
22124300	22126300	We are going to do cooking though.
22126300	22127300	I need to cook.
22127300	22128300	Jesse.
22129300	22130300	We need to cook.
22131300	22132300	Refling.
22132300	22133300	We need to cook.
22133300	22134300	Okay, I'm following the bunny.
22134300	22136300	Honestly, I should just follow the bunny.
22138300	22140300	Right, we're just going to follow report.
22140300	22141300	Follow.
22142300	22144300	Wait, wasn't the bunny the one that gave me the poison?
22144300	22146300	Why would I follow the bunny?
22148300	22150300	Hope I can join in next time.
22150300	22151300	Absolutely.
22152300	22153300	Absolutely.
22153300	22154300	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
22154300	22155300	Oh, scary.
22155300	22156300	Oh, no!
22156300	22157300	It doesn't go stuck.
22158300	22159300	Oh, no, refling's there.
22159300	22160300	I was an AFK refling.
22160300	22161300	Okay.
22162300	22163300	If you want to see where we are,
22163300	22164300	we're in world three AA
22164300	22166300	and we're outside the creepy,
22166300	22168300	creepy drain or manner.
22168300	22171300	Now, apparently we can get hurt in here.
22171300	22173300	So if anyone doesn't have food,
22173300	22174300	do you want to trade me
22174300	22176300	and I'll share my food with you?
22178300	22180300	If you send a trade offer,
22180300	22181300	I'll give you some food
22181300	22182300	because apparently we can get hurt.
22182300	22183300	But I think we can run away.
22183300	22185300	We just need to run away.
22186300	22187300	That's all.
22188300	22189300	I crashed.
22189300	22190300	Time to head back in game.
22191300	22193300	The forest is pretty scary.
22193300	22194300	Okay, we got a light.
22195300	22196300	Follow the bunny.
22196300	22197300	Last time I did that,
22197300	22198300	I found myself in Wonderland.
22200300	22202300	Okay, this refling needs some food.
22202300	22203300	Here you go.
22206300	22207300	Is there another?
22207300	22208300	Or has everyone got food?
22208300	22209300	Did you all cook meat?
22209300	22211300	I think you all must have cooked meat, yeah.
22211300	22212300	Oh, there's fires to cook meat
22212300	22214300	if you picked up meat from the coals.
22216300	22218300	Only now I notice that the strange
22218300	22220300	horse head refling
22220300	22222300	that walks strangely is no more there.
22222300	22224300	We are safe for now
22224300	22226300	from the strange walking refling.
22226300	22228300	We've got someone giving us a gluck gluck
22228300	22229300	outside the gates.
22231300	22233300	Been cooking the coos, right?
22233300	22235300	Okay, I don't know what happens here.
22235300	22237300	But I think the forest attacked...
22237300	22238300	Oh, wait, wait!
22238300	22239300	Sorry, sorry.
22239300	22240300	The quest is out here.
22240300	22241300	Talk to the lady here.
22241300	22242300	Sorry, talk to the lady.
22242300	22243300	Talk to the lady at the door.
22243300	22244300	Can you please help me?
22244300	22245300	I'm in a terrible spot of trouble.
22245300	22247300	Start, Ernest, to chicken.
22247300	22248300	Absolutely.
22248300	22249300	Ah, sounds like a quest.
22249300	22250300	I'll help.
22250300	22251300	Yes, yes.
22251300	22252300	I suppose is a quest.
22252300	22254300	My fiancee Ernest and I came to this hoose.
22254300	22256300	Seeing that we were a little lost,
22256300	22259300	Ernest decided to go in and ask for directions.
22259300	22260300	That was an hour ago.
22260300	22261300	This house looks spooky.
22261300	22263300	Can you see if you can find it for me?
22264300	22265300	I'll see what I can do.
22267300	22268300	Thank you, thank you.
22268300	22269300	I'm very grateful.
22269300	22270300	Okay, what are we?
22270300	22272300	Did we go inside now?
22272300	22273300	I'm scared.
22274300	22277300	All right, open the large door.
22277300	22278300	Oh, wait!
22278300	22279300	Requirements for the quest.
22279300	22281300	You need poison and fish food.
22281300	22282300	Oh, no!
22282300	22284300	Where do you get poison and fish food?
22286300	22287300	For the other reflins.
22287300	22289300	I thought you were being funny, other reflin.
22289300	22290300	I didn't realize.
22290300	22292300	Oh, wait, you're giving me something?
22292300	22294300	Why are you giving me?
22294300	22296300	Is that a boat plug?
22298300	22299300	A holy symbol.
22299300	22301300	What does it do?
22301300	22302300	I wear it.
22303300	22304300	It's like a star.
22305300	22307300	Anyone need poison or fish food?
22307300	22309300	Yeah, I thought that reflim was being funny,
22309300	22310300	giving me poison fish food.
22310300	22312300	Turns out it's actually for the quest.
22314300	22316300	That Samsung Galaxy Slurp.
22317300	22319300	My life can't handle another MMO
22319300	22320300	being through four in my life.
22320300	22321300	So this refling...
22322300	22325300	So this refling will just keep chat company.
22326300	22328300	We're only doing 99.
22328300	22330300	I don't know how to get poison or fish food.
22330300	22332300	There might be a refling that has enough supplies.
22333300	22334300	I didn't realize.
22334300	22335300	I never said.
22336300	22337300	I'm crazy.
22337300	22339300	Recommended items, none.
22339300	22341300	Or can you get them in the house?
22345300	22348300	There's a spawn for them, but they're very slow.
22348300	22351300	Okay, at least we can spawn the items.
22352300	22353300	In the house.
22354300	22356300	Right, I'm gonna very quickly go for a pee.
22356300	22358300	I don't know why I need to pee so much.
22358300	22359300	I think I'll make a tea as well.
22359300	22361300	Sorry, my voice is like really struggling.
22364300	22367300	I really want to stream for long.
22371300	22374300	I'm worried about how long I can last during my ASMR stream.
22375300	22377300	A little tinkle break, yeah.
22378300	22379300	A little tinkle-winkle.
22379300	22381300	The poison's in the house near the kitchen.
22381300	22383300	Okay, so at least we know the fish food
22383300	22384300	and the thing he does respawn.
22384300	22385300	I'm gonna make another tea.
22385300	22387300	I'm so sorry about all the breaks today.
22387300	22388300	It's my voice.
22389300	22391300	I'm getting, I'm getting nervous.
22391300	22392300	I'm not gonna be able to make it.
22392300	22394300	But for the ASMR and the sweet trying stream,
22394300	22396300	like, oh, sorry, I just stood on the mic.
22396300	22397300	Sorry about that.
22397300	22399300	I just absolutely obliterate your ears there.
22399300	22400300	Don't apologize.
22400300	22401300	I'll be back.
22401300	22403300	I'll literally be in a minute, okay?
22403300	22404300	To pee.
22451300	22452300	Yeah.
22481300	22482300	Yeah.
22511300	22512300	Yeah.
22541300	22542300	Yeah.
22571300	22572300	Yeah.
22601300	22602300	Yeah.
22631300	22632300	Yeah.
22661300	22663300	Yeah.
22691300	22698300	I don't know if it's a jumpscare when the tracking doesn't catch me coming into the room.
22698300	22701300	And I just unmute and I'm like, oh.
22701300	22702300	Oh.
22702300	22703300	Oh.
22703300	22704300	Oh.
22704300	22705300	Oh.
22705300	22706300	Oh.
22706300	22707300	Oh.
22707300	22708300	Oh.
22708300	22709300	Oh.
22709300	22710300	Oh.
22710300	22711300	Oh.
22711300	22712300	Oh.
22712300	22713300	Oh.
22713300	22714300	Oh.
22714300	22715300	Oh.
22715300	22716300	Oh.
22716300	22717300	Oh.
22717300	22718300	Oh.
22718300	22719300	Oh.
22719300	22720300	Oh.
22720300	22721300	Oh.
22721300	22722300	Oh.
22722300	22723300	Oh.
22723300	22724300	Oh.
22724300	22725300	Oh.
22725300	22726300	Oh.
22726300	22727300	You died.
22727300	22730300	Woman in the scar.
22730300	22738300	Why is it so loud in the music menu?
22738300	22742300	Thank goodness it doesn't link the details on the audio.
22742300	22743300	I think we're in skating with it.
22743300	22746300	Some people stream, what do you need?
22746300	22748300	Right.
22748300	22750300	an air nest.
22750300	22752300	Chang.
22752300	22755300	One refling went to go grab some spades for people who don't have one.
22755300	22757300	Oh sugar, I don't have a spade either.
22757300	22759300	Oh wait, what am I doing?
22759300	22760300	No, this one.
22760300	22762300	And then this one.
22764300	22766300	Uh, okay.
22766300	22768300	Are we waiting for spades?
22770300	22772300	Trade for spade!
22772300	22774300	Trade me! Trade mommy! Trade mommy!
22774300	22776300	Mommy needs a spade!
22776300	22778300	Just one, please.
22784300	22786300	I did make another spade.
22786300	22788300	I'm happy to say my pee was clear.
22788300	22792300	Um, I don't think I can do endurance.
22792300	22794300	My...
22794300	22796300	My throat is very sore right now.
22796300	22800300	It's very raw and it hurts, okay?
22800300	22802300	I'm needing your ink to help me
22802300	22804300	unironically soothe my throat.
22804300	22806300	So I think what the deal is
22806300	22809300	when Mercy goes live,
22809300	22813300	which is in T-minus
22813300	22818300	two and a half hours for snippets,
22818300	22820300	we'll raid into her.
22820300	22822300	If that's okay.
22822300	22824300	Um, there's a spade inside as well.
22824300	22825300	Just woke up. How's runes keep going?
22825300	22827300	It's going good!
22827300	22829300	Um, sadly my voice can't keep up.
22829300	22831300	This is when I get really frustrated for streaming.
22831300	22833300	I could happily stream 12 hours right now.
22834300	22836300	But it really hurts.
22836300	22839300	Okay, dropping some poison and fish food.
22839300	22841300	Okay, we'll wait until it loads up.
22844300	22846300	Honey, ink, tea, honestly.
22846300	22848300	Mercy's in two hours, yeah.
22848300	22850300	Oh good, been having tons of fun
22850300	22853300	and it's already a long stream, don't feel bad, yeah.
22853300	22855300	What do you mean? This is a baby stream for me?
22855300	22856300	Are you joking me?
22856300	22858300	Literally a two hour stream,
22858300	22860300	which is like the average for a VTuber,
22860300	22862300	is like a millisecond in my time.
22863300	22865300	Like, oh, I feel so bad.
22865300	22867300	I'm only going to stream eight hours today.
22867300	22868300	Ah!
22868300	22871300	I mean, what do you mean I got to play a multiplayer game
22871300	22873300	with quite literally, like,
22873300	22877300	how freaking blessed is it to be able to play a multiplayer game
22877300	22879300	with Reeflings live
22879300	22881300	whilst we're having a carry-on,
22881300	22883300	just meme-ing about freaking doing head-banging,
22883300	22885300	like, I've been dripped out,
22885300	22887300	I've been getting gifts and stuff,
22887300	22889300	people giving money, like,
22889300	22891300	it's not a job!
22891300	22893300	Like, this is fun!
22893300	22895300	Like, I'm having so much fun!
22896300	22898300	Ugh, I wish there was some sort of secret
22898300	22901300	to, like, fixing, like, my voice from vocal strain,
22901300	22903300	but the sad secret is it's literally just
22903300	22905300	shut up, stop talking.
22905300	22907300	Ugh, which is so annoying.
22909300	22911300	Better to end early than strain your throat.
22911300	22913300	I mean, it's already strained right now, but, uh...
22914300	22916300	What do you mean, multiplayer-to-ever talk,
22916300	22918300	yapping sessions, honestly,
22918300	22920300	is just yap, yap, yap.
22920300	22922300	We got a little spooky boy!
22922300	22924300	Spooky, spooky, bump again!
22925300	22927300	You're so misunderstood.
22927300	22929300	Oh, did you like Emmy's cover?
22929300	22930300	No.
22930300	22931300	Mo!
22931300	22933300	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
22933300	22934300	Oh, it's in a mo!
22934300	22935300	Oh, you're yawning just head off!
22935300	22936300	Oh, that's hilarious.
22936300	22938300	I'm waiting for the fish food to load,
22938300	22940300	so the others can grab it,
22940300	22942300	but I actually don't see it loading.
22943300	22945300	Having so much fun just hanging out at the Reeflings,
22945300	22947300	have all of the quests done already?
22947300	22949300	No, the quests are not done, please don't worry,
22949300	22951300	we're doing the free quest,
22951300	22953300	Erin is the chicken at the moment.
22953300	22954300	We've done a hand...
22954300	22956300	Oh, I've got my BS forehead in the way,
22956300	22958300	hold on, let me just close this for a second.
22958300	22960300	Here is all the quests we've done,
22960300	22962300	so free quests, we've done Cook's Assistant,
22962300	22964300	we're doing Big Erin Ease,
22964300	22966300	the chicken right now.
22966300	22968300	We did the mystery,
22968300	22970300	the restless ghost Romeo and Juliet,
22970300	22973300	Sheepshearer, X marks the spot,
22973300	22975300	we're finishing Erin is the chicken,
22975300	22977300	and then we're going back to update,
22977300	22979300	to grind on our cooking stats.
22980300	22983300	Can't expect you to do constant endurance streams day after day,
22983300	22985300	sadly I hate it,
22985300	22987300	I don't like doing short streams,
22987300	22989300	I just feel so like...
22989300	22991300	I don't know what the word is,
22991300	22996300	I have been yearning for this day,
22996300	22998300	for an entire year,
22998300	23001300	for this time, sorry, not for this day in particular,
23001300	23003300	but for this time,
23003300	23006300	and it's just like...
23006300	23010300	It's frustrating that the only reason I can't stream more
23010300	23011300	is because of my voice,
23011300	23013300	and not because I'm tired,
23013300	23014300	or I don't feel well,
23014300	23015300	or I don't want to type thing,
23015300	23016300	it's frustrating,
23016300	23018300	it's my voice.
23018300	23019300	That's it.
23019300	23022300	That's the only reason I can't stream for long,
23022300	23025300	because it hurts to talk right now.
23027300	23029300	Jesus, you haven't seen the whole song!
23031300	23033300	Try to live up to the name, you know?
23034300	23035300	Maybe.
23035300	23037300	I asked for a little bit off the top.
23037300	23039300	Hey, yo, who's the barber?
23040300	23041300	Man, we gotta go both.
23041300	23043300	Okay, the poison isn't loading on the floor for me,
23043300	23045300	but I think we'll do it,
23045300	23047300	so as long as you guys have accepted the quest,
23047300	23050300	we're gonna go inside now, reflings.
23050300	23052300	It's taking nice and slow.
23052300	23054300	I think the trees hit you on the way past,
23054300	23057300	so just be careful you don't stray from the path too much.
23057300	23059300	Assumers supposed to go...
23059300	23061300	Ah, the tree frickin' went for me.
23061300	23063300	Open large door.
23063300	23065300	Okay.
23067300	23069300	Oh, there's like haunted things.
23069300	23071300	Where are we supposed to go?
23071300	23073300	Get the gauge and tube.
23073300	23075300	Where is that?
23077300	23079300	And not here, maybe it's upstairs?
23082300	23084300	Okay, we...
23084300	23086300	I'm gonna wait until...
23087300	23089300	Oh, that's not good.
23089300	23092300	Wait, I'm just gonna check how the reflings made it in.
23092300	23095300	Go up the stairs, reflings, when you come inside.
23096300	23098300	Is that the last refling?
23103300	23105300	Who's that?
23105300	23107300	I think that's the last refling.
23107300	23109300	We all need to go upstairs.
23110300	23112300	How are you even there?
23112300	23113300	The chair's attacking him!
23113300	23115300	Oh my god, that chair being yours!
23120300	23121300	Okay, that...
23121300	23122300	Is there no refling there?
23122300	23124300	Oh, I'll go up the stairs.
23126300	23127300	Oh, he like...
23127300	23128300	Oh, someone's beating them up.
23128300	23129300	Wait, where are we supposed to go?
23129300	23130300	Up here?
23130300	23132300	Up these stairs to the left?
23132300	23134300	As soon as we come up?
23136300	23138300	Nothing's being highlighted for me.
23138300	23140300	Runlight, you're failing me!
23140300	23141300	Am I supposed to go here?
23141300	23143300	Talk to the professor?
23146300	23148300	Be careful, there's lots of things...
23148300	23149300	Brian!
23149300	23152300	It frustrates you because you can't control it
23152300	23154300	and that's the most frustrating thing.
23154300	23156300	Not being able to control something.
23156300	23157300	That's right.
23157300	23158300	Thank you, Iron Looper.
23158300	23159300	For the tip.
23159300	23161300	And yeah, just like...
23161300	23163300	Runlight is telling you to use...
23166300	23167300	Wait, hold on.
23167300	23169300	Oh no, I'm messing up.
23169300	23171300	Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
23174300	23175300	That's not so easy.
23175300	23176300	Well, look at them.
23177300	23179300	Oh, maybe I should be reading that out.
23179300	23180300	What would that say?
23180300	23183300	Runlight is telling you to use your poison on your fish food.
23183300	23184300	Okay.
23184300	23186300	Okay, I have poison fish food.
23186300	23188300	Wait, never mind.
23189300	23190300	Just hypnotize yourself.
23190300	23192300	Strongly trust me, I love you and enjoy every second,
23192300	23194300	but your health is important.
23194300	23196300	Yeah, like, as long as my voice doesn't break,
23196300	23197300	then I'm good to go.
23197300	23199300	In my pain.
23199300	23200300	Where...
23200300	23203300	Where is this freaking map telling me to go?
23203300	23204300	I'm so confused.
23204300	23205300	I wanna go.
23207300	23209300	We were to go outside?
23209300	23211300	Oh, right, okay.
23212300	23213300	Oh, no, sorry.
23213300	23215300	Close the map, not close.
23216300	23218300	Right, so go downstairs.
23221300	23223300	Okay, come downstairs.
23224300	23227300	Poison the fish food and then come back out of the mansion.
23229300	23230300	Okay.
23230300	23232300	Oh, this is a rough one to do together, I think,
23232300	23234300	so if you've not got...
23234300	23236300	The door won't open.
23236300	23238300	Over here.
23238300	23239300	Okay, okay, okay.
23239300	23241300	How do I get over there?
23242300	23244300	Wait, open the door.
23244300	23245300	The chair beating you up?
23245300	23246300	Oh, no, they just run around.
23246300	23247300	I thought the chair was like,
23247300	23249300	beat you up in the game on my cheek.
23253300	23255300	Oh, there's a rubber tube.
23255300	23256300	I get it.
23256300	23258300	Get the gauge in the tube.
23258300	23259300	Oh, my God.
23259300	23261300	Open the door.
23261300	23263300	What's that?
23264300	23266300	Oh, I'm actually kind of scared of that.
23267300	23268300	Wait, I can't go in.
23268300	23269300	The door's locked.
23269300	23270300	Oh, right, okay.
23272300	23275300	Someone's dropped a speed ahead if you need it, by the way.
23277300	23279300	But we're taking the long way around.
23282300	23283300	Okay, I'm glad the chairs don't beat you up
23283300	23286300	because, honestly, death by chair is pretty embarrassing.
23286300	23288300	Right, open the door.
23288300	23291300	Or I'm gonna throw rocks through your window.
23292300	23294300	Open the door.
23294300	23297300	Okay, so one by one door, but we can add it.
23297300	23299300	I need to get the key first.
23299300	23300300	Well, she's a stubborn one,
23300300	23301300	but I guess she keeps up till the day
23301300	23302300	she can take care of herself
23302300	23304300	to some fish so hard, man.
23306300	23308300	Okay, okay, we're now outside.
23308300	23310300	This is a very hard one to follow,
23310300	23312300	quest-wise.
23312300	23314300	Especially if you had a rune-like,
23314300	23316300	rune-crafting guild.
23316300	23317300	Stop.
23317300	23320300	Are you telling someone that we're rune-crafting guilds?
23321300	23324300	Okay, I'm just following the Easter bunny.
23324300	23327300	Follow the bunny, the bunny, the bunny.
23327300	23329300	Follow the Easter bunny.
23329300	23331300	To east, to east, to east.
23331300	23333300	Search compost heap.
23333300	23334300	Heap.
23334300	23335300	I love it.
23335300	23337300	A bit of cheeky vandalism.
23337300	23338300	Okay, we did it.
23338300	23340300	Oh, what did I do?
23340300	23342300	You find a small key.
23342300	23344300	Okay.
23344300	23346300	And now...
23347300	23349300	Okay.
23349300	23351300	Oh, there's a thing ahead.
23351300	23353300	Okay, there's a fountain ahead.
23353300	23354300	I don't know.
23354300	23355300	Has that already come to you?
23355300	23356300	I feel like...
23356300	23358300	I feel like someone's probably stuck in the house right now.
23358300	23361300	As long as you try and come outside, then you'll be fine.
23361300	23363300	So as long as you've all got the key,
23363300	23365300	come to the fountain next.
23365300	23366300	There's a fountain through the trees.
23366300	23367300	The trees might whip you,
23367300	23369300	but you should survive.
23369300	23371300	Like, it's literally one HP at least.
23371300	23374300	Poisoned fish food on the fountain.
23374300	23376300	Use on the fountain.
23376300	23378300	Oh, the tree just made a noise.
23379300	23382300	Use it on the fountain.
23382300	23384300	Okay.
23384300	23386300	The piranhas start eating the food,
23386300	23389300	then dine float to the surface.
23389300	23391300	And then search the fountain.
23391300	23393300	There seems to be a pressure gauge in here,
23393300	23395300	and a lot of dead fish.
23395300	23397300	Well, yeah, you just roll them,
23397300	23399300	smoke them.
23401300	23402300	Come outside.
23402300	23405300	Yes, I see, I see.
23405300	23407300	Okay, once we've all stopped
23407300	23410300	head banging into the fountain,
23410300	23413300	then we go back into the house.
23413300	23416300	Anyone got some spare poison fish?
23418300	23421300	Ah, the poison was in the house, I think.
23421300	23423300	Wait, we're outside the house.
23423300	23424300	How do we get back in?
23424300	23427300	Why is it making me go around in a circle?
23427300	23430300	I'm spinning around.
23430300	23432300	Get out of my way.
23433300	23436300	I didn't think for how much time
23436300	23438300	you prepared for this, by the way.
23438300	23440300	How is it, is it like you expected?
23440300	23442300	To me, you're having a lot of fun,
23442300	23444300	but maybe you have more to see.
23444300	23445300	On RuneScape?
23445300	23446300	I'm getting whipped by a tree.
23446300	23448300	Sorry, sorry, Ruflin's getting whipped by a tree
23448300	23450300	because of me, sorry.
23450300	23452300	I didn't mean RuneScape, it took a little second
23452300	23454300	to get ready to stream out.
23454300	23456300	I wasn't that bad.
23456300	23458300	Scale it in time, you just have to run in
23458300	23460300	and pick the tube, then run out.
23460300	23462300	Make it in turns, who wants to go first?
23464300	23466300	Ah, fuck it, I'll go first.
23466300	23468300	I need a lead by example.
23468300	23470300	Okay, grab the tube and then...
23470300	23472300	Okay, I got whacked for two,
23472300	23474300	so just make sure you get out in time.
23476300	23478300	Would you prefer to be whipped by a tree?
23478300	23480300	Is it instance,
23480300	23482300	or are we going to have to wait for that to reload?
23482300	23484300	Oh no, you've got it, you've got it.
23484300	23485300	Okay, that's fine.
23485300	23486300	Are you beating him up?
23486300	23488300	He said nah, hold on, let me do this,
23488300	23490300	Ruflin's like all this.
23490300	23492300	He's going to skillspec him, he's going to skillspec
23492300	23494300	he's going to do the little twirl thing.
23494300	23496300	Oh, streaming in general has been absolutely fantastic.
23496300	23498300	It's gone exactly the way I wanted it to.
23500300	23502300	I love streams, Nathan,
23502300	23504300	and I love long streams and yapping people's heads off
23504300	23506300	and it's just gone absolutely amazing.
23510300	23512300	Just fantastic.
23512300	23514300	For me, I don't like the mega
23514300	23516300	super professional streams, don't mind me.
23516300	23518300	Some people really like it.
23518300	23520300	Let's go, has everyone got it?
23522300	23524300	Thank you, Ruflin, for killing the skelly boy.
23524300	23526300	Has everyone got the rubber tube?
23528300	23530300	I don't think everyone's got it.
23530300	23532300	I don't know if it's been a bit funny,
23532300	23534300	but you should be able to go in and get the rubber tube
23534300	23536300	now that you've got the key.
23538300	23540300	Oh, someone's getting attacked over there.
23540300	23542300	Is there a Rufling? Oh, I thought a Ruflin just perished there.
23542300	23544300	Ruflin just perished there.
23544300	23546300	I'm happy to hear that, yeah.
23548300	23550300	There is nothing like a professional stream.
23550300	23552300	Where's the fish food?
23560300	23562300	Upstairs is the fish food reefling,
23562300	23564300	someone says.
23566300	23568300	I'll wait here until the other reeflings are caught
23568300	23570300	because it's not fair to skip ahead.
23570300	23572300	I like when funny Scott women yank to me for hours.
23572300	23574300	Simple as, nothing more.
23574300	23576300	Now, people really enjoy professional streams
23576300	23578300	from other people, which is great,
23578300	23580300	but for me, I'm just like...
23584300	23586300	It's the best I can say.
23588300	23590300	Oh, we're getting two head bang.
23590300	23592300	Yo, I'm starting to think this is getting...
23592300	23594300	Hold on, oh no, I can't wait, wait, let me zoom up a bit.
23594300	23596300	Let me take one more step
23596300	23598300	for no particular reason at all.
23598300	23600300	Okay, let me take one more step
23600300	23602300	for no particular reason at all.
23602300	23604300	Because it's absolutely no reason at all.
23610300	23612300	We are literal children, this is terrible.
23612300	23614300	That awful getting...
23614300	23616300	Hey, hey, hey, hey, he dancing on it,
23616300	23618300	he dancing on it, he doing the split on it.
23622300	23624300	I love your silly yapping.
23624300	23626300	Oh my God, a ghost is going for it.
23632300	23634300	Is there a refling on the outskirts?
23634300	23636300	Oh, I think I'm too far away to be able to see
23636300	23638300	if someone's at the compost heap right now.
23638300	23640300	Oh no, someone's getting beaten up.
23640300	23642300	Oh no, it's not him though.
23642300	23644300	I have salmon if you want it,
23644300	23646300	a refling that's literally protecting us all.
23648300	23650300	There's salmon juice, whoa, what is that?
23650300	23652300	Oh, is that for me?
23652300	23654300	Wait, should I do this in the middle?
23654300	23656300	I don't know what he does.
23656300	23658300	Scottlefish, are you there?
23658300	23660300	Should I do it or no?
23660300	23662300	I don't know if the old man's got a good quest or not.
23664300	23666300	Did I talk to him?
23668300	23670300	Do it, okay, someone says do it.
23670300	23672300	Oh, there you are, I hoped you would talk to me.
23672300	23674300	I get so lonely, I have a present, I must get going now.
23674300	23676300	Oh!
23676300	23678300	Oh, he just gave me an uncut emerald.
23678300	23680300	I didn't even ask anything.
23680300	23682300	I didn't even ask anything.
23682300	23684300	Oh, don't mind if I do,
23684300	23686300	I thought he was going to like whisk me away.
23686300	23688300	But he didn't.
23690300	23692300	Oh, I see the poison.
23692300	23694300	Whoa, poison's like 700.
23696300	23698300	Well, I know where the poison is,
23698300	23700300	if I don't need to know, it's by the left.
23700300	23702300	As you come in.
23704300	23706300	Does he need help?
23710300	23712300	Wow.
23714300	23716300	You wish to trade with me, what do you wish to trade?
23716300	23718300	Oh, you're giving it,
23718300	23720300	oh, the diamonds,
23722300	23724300	how you call them.
23724300	23726300	I don't know, the rocks in the ground.
23726300	23728300	What are these called? It's not jewelry.
23728300	23730300	But they're rocks.
23732300	23734300	What are diamonds category?
23734300	23736300	What are the category of ruby and plafa and that?
23736300	23738300	Gemstones!
23738300	23740300	Oh my god, I forgot that word there.
23740300	23742300	Jeez, low waist.
23742300	23744300	I literally forgot the word gems there.
23744300	23746300	I apologize.
23746300	23748300	Watch ads showed up tipped and left.
23748300	23750300	Or, yeah, or in gems.
23750300	23752300	I got out.
23752300	23754300	Oh god, we're all headbanging.
23754300	23756300	Are you practicing later?
23756300	23758300	For when the next 10 audios come out?
23758300	23760300	Wait, where is it? Headbanging?
23760300	23762300	Headbanging.
23762300	23764300	Oh my god, we really are a call.
23764300	23766300	Clearly, look at us go.
23772300	23774300	Oh, do you need, you need help,
23774300	23776300	holy crap you need help right now.
23776300	23778300	I've got salmon.
23778300	23780300	This should heal you up.
23782300	23784300	Go, go, go.
23784300	23786300	Is there any reeflings?
23786300	23788300	Oh no, they're self healing.
23788300	23790300	Is there any reeflings on the outskirts?
23790300	23798300	I can't really tell. I don't want to go ahead in case there's someone outside doing that. Fountain, but, um...
23800300	23802300	Is everyone here? Did we make it?
23802300	23804300	If there's a roofling, oh.
23804300	23806300	Who did that? Who did that?
23806300	23808300	That was you?
23808300	23812300	Okay, we're reporting you for harassment.
23812300	23816300	Interesting, we're in sync for me, but on stream.
23816300	23819300	My ping is really high to everyone.
23819300	23823300	They've had plenty of time. Yeah, is everyone here? I think so.
23823300	23825300	Hi hi, how's stream going?
23825300	23828300	It's been going amazing. Look at me and the roofling gang, we're doing questing.
23828300	23831300	Okay, I think everyone's got the plastic tube.
23831300	23833300	They get the gauge and tube.
23833300	23835300	Get the oil can next.
23835300	23837300	So, open this door.
23837300	23839300	We'll go through.
23839300	23841300	Okay.
23841300	23843300	I think we're all ready.
23843300	23845300	Okay.
23845300	23848300	Don't have the tube, but also got the gauge.
23848300	23850300	Wait, you don't have the tube?
23850300	23852300	No, I do have the tube.
23853300	23856300	Okay, we need to interact with this blue thing over here.
23856300	23858300	Wait, you've not got the tube?
23858300	23860300	Who's not got the tube?
23864300	23867300	Tube, you just run in and pick up when it spawns.
23869300	23872300	Go in the closet and get the rubber if you don't have...
23873300	23875300	I shouldn't have said that.
23877300	23879300	Oh my god, the shadow band GB's Twitter.
23879300	23882300	All of our Twitter's looks like a shadow band, it's ridiculous.
23882300	23885300	Like how sensitive it is.
23892300	23894300	Oh, what's that? It's a big thing.
23894300	23896300	Oh, it's gone.
23896300	23898300	Did they get the tube?
23898300	23900300	Did you get the tube? I think so.
23900300	23902300	All right, fun part of the quest. Let's go.
23902300	23904300	Let's go. Oh, the door...
23904300	23906300	The door's fine.
23906300	23908300	Hold on, sorry, I probably just closed that door on you.
23908300	23910300	Okay, search the bookcase.
23910300	23912300	Search the bookcase.
23912300	23914300	Oh, is that one by one?
23914300	23916300	Maybe a one by one moment. Hold on.
23916300	23918300	Hey, let's go.
23918300	23920300	Okay, go down the ladder.
23920300	23922300	Wait, go down the ladder when you're ready.
23922300	23924300	Is that everyone? Yeah, that's everyone.
23924300	23926300	Once you get through the bookshelf.
23926300	23928300	Okay, we did it.
23928300	23930300	The whole gang's here.
23930300	23932300	No replaying left behind.
23936300	23938300	Oh my god, we're beating up the rats, literally.
23938300	23940300	Oh god, what do we do?
23940300	23942300	Okay, there's a lever on the wall.
23942300	23944300	Pull lever alpha on the wall over here.
23946300	23948300	I assume this is going to be instanced to us.
23948300	23950300	So...
23950300	23952300	I don't know.
23952300	23954300	Then pull lever, bravo.
23954300	23956300	Oh, the music's all like...
23960300	23962300	Okay.
23962300	23964300	Now this gate is a jar.
23968300	23970300	And English, if it's like slightly open,
23970300	23972300	it's a jar.
23972300	23974300	Pull lever D.
23974300	23976300	Oh, I'll pull the D lever all day long.
23976300	23978300	Come over here, weak one.
23980300	23982300	What did that do?
23982300	23984300	Okay.
23986300	23988300	Oh god, it's a one by one gate.
23988300	23990300	Why is there a biggest issue right now?
23990300	23992300	One by one gate.
23996300	23998300	Oil can has a slow respawn as well.
23998300	24000300	I need an oil...
24000300	24002300	I think we all need an oil can.
24002300	24004300	So we're just going to have to go for it and be patient.
24004300	24006300	I'm sure you can wait.
24006300	24008300	I don't know if all the levers are the same for everyone.
24008300	24010300	It looks like you guys are going different ways.
24010300	24012300	So I think it might be different.
24018300	24020300	World hop when you get into the room
24020300	24022300	and then hop back.
24022300	24024300	Yeah, you guys are really going different ways for me.
24024300	24026300	So I think it's different for everyone.
24028300	24030300	Oh, the classic one by one gate.
24030300	24032300	It's over.
24032300	24034300	Lever solution is the same for everyone.
24034300	24036300	How's everyone going...
24036300	24038300	Are you guys...
24038300	24040300	Do you see this one?
24040300	24042300	That way everyone can grab it faster.
24042300	24044300	Yes.
24046300	24048300	Okay.
24048300	24050300	Okay.
24052300	24054300	Okay.
24054300	24056300	Okay, I love this runelight plugin
24056300	24058300	because if I had to do this
24058300	24060300	by my brain, it would be over.
24068300	24070300	This is crazy.
24074300	24076300	All levers are unique in their own way.
24076300	24078300	Exactly.
24078300	24080300	Wow.
24080300	24082300	Let's see.
24082300	24084300	Pull this lever.
24084300	24086300	We're almost done.
24086300	24088300	Okay, I was going to say that's like a lot of fricking questions.
24088300	24090300	Oh wait, sorry.
24090300	24092300	I'm going to see if my tea is at an acceptable temperature
24092300	24094300	if I'm going to scold myself on it.
24094300	24096300	That's why there's one or the other.
24096300	24098300	That was...
24104300	24106300	All these doors.
24106300	24108300	Oh, right.
24110300	24112300	Am I taking it?
24112300	24114300	And then you guys are world hopping?
24118300	24120300	And then you're coming back to this world?
24122300	24124300	Yeah, this track is...
24126300	24128300	Gen 2 based after
24128300	24130300	old school runescape tracks
24130300	24132300	question mark.
24136300	24138300	Oh wait, I should be facing you today.
24138300	24140300	Honestly,
24140300	24142300	I wouldn't mind that.
24142300	24144300	I'm kind of down for that.
24144300	24146300	I was actually thinking of
24146300	24148300	Legend of Zelda Minish Cap
24148300	24150300	but brought
24150300	24152300	to kind of modern standards
24152300	24154300	for Gen 2.
24154300	24156300	Runescape OSD?
24158300	24160300	If we had like a mischievous little brat thing,
24160300	24162300	this song
24162300	24164300	was kind of like
24164300	24166300	not Circus S.
24166300	24168300	I guess it was Circus S.
24168300	24170300	Does everyone have an oil can?
24170300	24172300	Or...
24172300	24174300	Oh, there's a respawn.
24174300	24176300	That took a whole second.
24176300	24178300	Everyone got an oil can?
24178300	24180300	Maybe I know you're taking that now.
24180300	24182300	Okay, if you have an oil can,
24182300	24184300	go back out to the center over here.
24184300	24186300	If you don't have an oil can,
24186300	24188300	wait for it to spawn in that room
24188300	24190300	or you can do what's called world hopping
24190300	24192300	where you purposely swap to a new world
24192300	24194300	and it should
24194300	24196300	be like a new instance.
24196300	24198300	But if you have an oil can, you're allowed to come out here.
24200300	24202300	Minish is 20 years old now.
24202300	24204300	Stubious brat.
24206300	24208300	I would watch Zelda.
24208300	24210300	I will uncontroll.
24210300	24212300	I just want to support whoever gets sea shanty.
24212300	24214300	No, it has to be like hidden,
24214300	24216300	but when you know what it is, you know.
24216300	24218300	Oh, there's a reefling there.
24218300	24220300	We're not ready yet.
24220300	24222300	I'll just check if anyone's back here.
24222300	24224300	Other than that reefling.
24224300	24226300	Oh, there's one there.
24226300	24228300	I was just straight up reefling.
24228300	24230300	You actually got the name reefling.
24230300	24232300	I'm surprised no one else took it.
24232300	24234300	I guess we'll just beat out...
24234300	24236300	We're gonna beat up rats out here.
24236300	24238300	Okay, we're just gonna get our combat level a bit higher.
24238300	24240300	Oh, I just leveled up.
24240300	24242300	What did I get? I got a taxix.
24242300	24244300	Oh, there's spiders as well.
24244300	24246300	Yeah, let's just level up her combat a little bit.
24246300	24248300	Why not?
24248300	24250300	Woo.
24250300	24252300	Us following her gives me
24252300	24254300	Ugandan knuckles flashbacks.
24254300	24256300	This beat only fake queen.
24258300	24260300	Would you hum shanty?
24260300	24262300	Hmm.
24262300	24264300	Hmm.
24264300	24266300	Hmm.
24266300	24268300	Hmm.
24268300	24270300	Hmm.
24270300	24272300	Hmm.
24272300	24274300	Hmm.
24274300	24276300	Hmm.
24276300	24278300	Hmm.
24278300	24280300	Hmm.
24280300	24282300	Yeah, I managed to get the reefling name
24282300	24284300	still five hours a day.
24284300	24286300	Yeah.
24286300	24288300	That's sea shanty.
24288300	24290300	We're just leveling up her combat.
24290300	24292300	Hmm.
24292300	24294300	There's still a reefling over there getting absolutely...
24294300	24296300	What are you getting annihilated by?
24296300	24298300	A rat? Oh, okay, that's fine.
24298300	24300300	And there's one there.
24300300	24302300	There's a third?
24302300	24304300	Yeah, we've got Hatsumiku chilling over there.
24304300	24306300	Hmm.
24306300	24308300	Hmm.
24308300	24310300	Reefling.
24310300	24312300	Now we have a max roll.
24312300	24314300	Hmm.
24314300	24316300	Let's get some level up.
24316300	24318300	No way that rat just dunked my shield.
24318300	24320300	I went bonk.
24320300	24322300	Yeah, Amy would have chosen...
24322300	24324300	Maybe.
24324300	24326300	She would show us maybe.
24326300	24328300	I remember that meme went like absolutely viral.
24328300	24330300	Someone said that was the start
24330300	24332300	of the brain rot meta
24332300	24334300	when it comes to memes.
24336300	24338300	Which I found rather unsafe.
24338300	24340300	Wow.
24342300	24344300	I think there's someone else
24344300	24346300	that's fighting that.
24346300	24348300	Here we go.
24348300	24350300	We've almost got all over
24350300	24352300	cans.
24352300	24354300	And then we'll level up on fishy.
24354300	24356300	I keep saying fishin'.
24356300	24358300	It's not fishin', we're doing kootin'.
24358300	24360300	My PCs fan just started
24360300	24362300	up. I get nervous when my PCs...
24362300	24364300	I'm like, what's wrong?
24364300	24366300	What's wrong?
24366300	24368300	Oh?
24368300	24370300	Last reefling that needs to can?
24370300	24372300	The question mark?
24372300	24374300	I don't see anyone else doing the levers.
24374300	24376300	Am I going crazy or are we clear?
24376300	24378300	Have we did it?
24378300	24380300	Are we ready to move on?
24380300	24382300	Oh, he's done it.
24382300	24384300	I don't want to say dancing.
24384300	24386300	Okay, if everyone's got a can,
24386300	24388300	up the ladders, please.
24388300	24390300	Little reeflings, if everyone's got a can.
24390300	24392300	Oh wait, no!
24392300	24394300	Sorry, there's one more.
24394300	24396300	I
24396300	24398300	think they're still doing the lever
24398300	24400300	stage.
24400300	24402300	I'm sorry, reefling such a badger.
24402300	24404300	You can come back down and we'll keep
24404300	24406300	killing the means.
24406300	24408300	He's
24408300	24410300	going to be absolutely beaten up by
24410300	24412300	that rat, so he'll help you out.
24412300	24414300	There you go.
24414300	24416300	Uh...
24420300	24422300	Did you get it?
24422300	24424300	I don't know.
24426300	24428300	Did you get it?
24428300	24430300	You're moving around erratically
24430300	24432300	as a reefling...
24434300	24436300	I don't know, are you stuck
24436300	24438300	on the levers?
24438300	24440300	You're not taping.
24440300	24442300	Go on, I'll catch up.
24442300	24444300	Are you sure, reeflings?
24444300	24446300	I won't feel anyone feel left out.
24448300	24450300	VR chat was well,
24450300	24452300	and that's just
24452300	24454300	a bit weird.
24454300	24456300	I was going to have to play VR chat
24456300	24458300	to learn how the
24458300	24460300	3D models work. I have no idea how that
24460300	24462300	3D model streaming works.
24462300	24464300	But I don't know if you can use
24464300	24466300	other programs as well.
24466300	24468300	Oh, I'm leveling combat,
24468300	24470300	not to brag.
24476300	24478300	You will learn.
24478300	24480300	Can you say error again?
24480300	24482300	Error?
24482300	24484300	Error.
24484300	24486300	Error, switching tracks.
24486300	24488300	You don't need to use VR chat
24488300	24490300	for 3D models.
24490300	24492300	I honestly don't know
24492300	24494300	anything about it. The girls want 3D models,
24494300	24496300	and I'll pay for it.
24496300	24498300	That's pretty much all I know about 3D models.
24498300	24500300	I'm like, joking.
24500300	24502300	If they want 3D models, they'll get it.
24506300	24508300	VR chat isn't interesting at all.
24508300	24510300	Oh!
24510300	24512300	I've saw VR
24512300	24514300	ASMR videos. I thought that was pretty cool.
24516300	24518300	And plus, it would be cool to see
24518300	24520300	the height difference of the girls as well.
24520300	24522300	Go on, y'all.
24522300	24524300	Okay, okay.
24524300	24526300	We're being sent away by the
24526300	24528300	reflying, right? Upstairs, everyone.
24528300	24530300	We're being sent away.
24530300	24532300	Upstairs.
24532300	24534300	Okay, there's a lever here.
24534300	24536300	Pull the lever, crunk!
24538300	24540300	Oh! Okay, okay, okay.
24540300	24542300	Right, we need to go up the stairs again.
24542300	24544300	Right, let's go back here.
24544300	24546300	I'mma sip my tea.
24546300	24548300	Okay.
24550300	24552300	You literally talk like a real mummy
24552300	24554300	with the girls. They want 3D models.
24554300	24556300	Yeah, I'll just pay for it, darlin'. There you go, darlin'.
24556300	24558300	All yours. I don't know what it's about,
24558300	24560300	but you just enjoy yourself.
24560300	24562300	It's true. They'll be like, I want this.
24562300	24564300	I'm like, oh, you just, oh, you get it.
24564300	24566300	You just enjoy yourself, hen.
24568300	24570300	Right, okay. Talk to the professor at the top of the stairs.
24570300	24572300	Oh, you found anything yet?
24572300	24574300	I have everything. Give them to me here, then.
24574300	24576300	All his.
24576300	24578300	Oh, you put them.
24578300	24580300	Noises are being made?
24580300	24582300	He's a man!
24582300	24584300	Thank you, madame. I was dreadfully irritating being a chicken.
24584300	24586300	How can I ever thank you?
24586300	24588300	Well, a cash reward is always nice.
24588300	24590300	Of course, of course!
24590300	24592300	You're awarded 4 quest points of 300 coins.
24592300	24594300	Yay!
24594300	24596300	That was really quick. Other than, like,
24596300	24598300	the horrific issues.
24598300	24600300	That was like a really quick quest.
24600300	24602300	Um...
24602300	24604300	Right, we're not doing any more questing.
24604300	24606300	We're leveling up.
24606300	24608300	Next.
24608300	24610300	Money, let's go!
24610300	24612300	What is this pressure gauge?
24612300	24614300	Don't touch it. It's going to explode.
24614300	24616300	What do we do?
24616300	24618300	What pressure gauge?
24618300	24620300	It's really like any other scientific
24620300	24622300	thing.
24622300	24624300	I guess that's it, and we just leave.
24624300	24626300	But that...
24626300	24628300	It's in the fountain.
24628300	24630300	It's in the fountain. That's why you need to poison it.
24630300	24632300	How bizarre.
24632300	24634300	Oh, there's the fish food.
24634300	24636300	Ugh!
24636300	24638300	I guess that's it. We're already
24638300	24640300	freaking done this quest. Hold on.
24640300	24642300	Wah.
24642300	24644300	Oh wait, why did you not let me out that door?
24646300	24648300	Open large door.
24648300	24650300	Wait, why does it make me turn backwards?
24652300	24654300	I keep... It doesn't let me out this door?
24654300	24656300	Open large door.
24656300	24658300	It won't open.
24658300	24660300	Front door is one way.
24660300	24662300	Oh, so we have to
24662300	24664300	go all the way around again?
24664300	24666300	Oh, okay.
24666300	24668300	Another interesting take
24668300	24670300	from the dev team?
24670300	24672300	Alright, let me sip into my tea.
24674300	24676300	Okay, yeah.
24676300	24678300	I'll go another one by one door.
24678300	24680300	It's over.
24680300	24682300	The chair's chasing me.
24682300	24684300	Can you even go that way?
24684300	24686300	Can you even go that way?
24686300	24688300	Oh, you can. You can come around this side?
24690300	24692300	Can you teach me?
24692300	24694300	Why to play Rensuke Tempah?
24696300	24698300	Get ready. Go right back.
24700300	24702300	Ow! The tree!
24704300	24706300	I don't want to go in a fight. Move!
24706300	24708300	What's going on? Why can't I move?
24708300	24710300	Hello?
24710300	24712300	Am I missing?
24712300	24714300	Why can't I not...
24714300	24716300	Why? That tree literally
24716300	24718300	had me in a death grip. Oh my gosh.
24720300	24722300	Mostly was a...
24722300	24724300	a guy of fun.
24724300	24726300	Don't get skill checked by a tree.
24726300	24728300	Literally, one error.
24728300	24730300	I almost died there.
24730300	24732300	I think the tree liked you, honestly.
24734300	24736300	Okay, we made it.
24736300	24738300	But I don't think that's all the reeflings.
24738300	24740300	This is dangerous, literally. Oh, there's a reefling there.
24742300	24744300	Right, we'll wait until a cool army.
24744300	24746300	I have an army of reeflings requesting,
24746300	24748300	but we're about to go level up our cooking next.
24748300	24750300	I'm trying to finish my honey tea
24750300	24752300	before it gets cold.
24754300	24756300	Wah! Okay.
24756300	24758300	Um, next thing
24758300	24760300	we're going to do is we're going to
24760300	24762300	travel north. We're going to take
24762300	24764300	a west and then north
24764300	24766300	and we're going to be outside
24766300	24768300	the village.
24768300	24770300	But we need to go get fish and rods and stuff.
24770300	24772300	I don't think there's a fish shop nearby.
24772300	24774300	So I think we're going to go to the Grand Exchange
24774300	24776300	and buy fish and rods.
24776300	24778300	Army, definitely not cold.
24778300	24780300	Yeah.
24780300	24782300	This music has given me
24782300	24784300	a fatal dose of nostalgia.
24784300	24786300	Passed so much
24786300	24788300	since the last Get Rektor is.
24788300	24790300	Hmm.
24790300	24792300	As I get stuck
24792300	24794300	I'm ruffling fans and bye.
24794300	24796300	I've never gotten a runescape.
24796300	24798300	It's like either you got into it or you didn't.
24798300	24800300	Right, I think that's everyone.
24800300	24802300	Hopefully, question mark.
24802300	24804300	As we head banger way of victory.
24804300	24806300	I don't know about the other
24806300	24808300	reefling that got stuck and sent us forward
24808300	24810300	but thank you for not holding us back.
24810300	24812300	By the same time I feel bad
24812300	24814300	because it's like the whole point of this is to
24814300	24816300	the question and stuff together.
24816300	24818300	Right, let's get in the nicer parts of the channel.
24818300	24820300	Let the evil at bay
24820300	24822300	type of thing go away.
24822300	24824300	Wait, let me finish my tea.
24826300	24828300	Either you got into it
24828300	24830300	and you're still playing this day or you didn't.
24830300	24832300	I got into Guild Wars instead.
24832300	24834300	I never played Guild Wars.
24834300	24836300	Hmm.
24836300	24838300	Hmm.
24838300	24840300	Hmm.
24840300	24842300	Trying to finish this.
24842300	24844300	Ah.
24844300	24846300	Oh, I thought it gave us feathers but it didn't.
24846300	24848300	I was just an image of a feather because we need
24848300	24850300	feathers to do fishing.
24850300	24852300	Hmm.
24852300	24854300	Hmm.
24854300	24856300	I was so into it and was so shy that
24856300	24858300	in taping class I'd want big letters, RuneScape rules
24858300	24860300	and wait for someone to see it and ask me if I played.
24860300	24862300	Aww, that's such a shame.
24866300	24868300	Feathers, we need feathers.
24868300	24870300	Birds of a feather.
24870300	24872300	Right, we're gonna take
24872300	24874300	a left
24874300	24876300	and go...
24876300	24878300	Oh wait, no. Do we need to go to Port Sarim?
24880300	24882300	I think we actually need to go to the fishing
24882300	24884300	shop to buy our rod and feathers.
24884300	24886300	The fishing shops
24886300	24888300	are west
24888300	24890300	and south so we'll go west and south.
24890300	24892300	Just follow me
24892300	24894300	with my golden stuff.
24894300	24896300	Oh no, I'm gonna follow the rabbit.
24898300	24900300	We follow the rabbit. You coming?
24900300	24902300	Refling?
24902300	24904300	Yes.
24904300	24906300	Uh...
24908300	24910300	Take us westward and then south
24910300	24912300	on the main road.
24912300	24914300	Feathers. Oh no, am I saying feathers?
24914300	24916300	Oh, we need some feathers.
24916300	24918300	Wait, how did you say feathers?
24918300	24920300	Feathers.
24920300	24922300	Feathers. Feathers.
24922300	24924300	Oh, it sounds like I'm kind of
24924300	24926300	saying father.
24926300	24928300	I guess. Feathers.
24928300	24930300	Your father.
24930300	24932300	In this line you also say
24932300	24934300	your father, isn't it?
24934300	24936300	And it's like, ah, that's my dad.
24936300	24938300	I don't want change.
24940300	24942300	I never played Guild Wars Organscape.
24942300	24944300	I want silly Scottish women!
24946300	24948300	Feathers.
24948300	24950300	Your wee feathers.
24950300	24952300	You'd weave it behind, Refling.
24952300	24954300	You'd put your wee running boots on.
24954300	24956300	You'd put your...
24962300	24964300	Feathers.
24964300	24966300	Feathers.
24966300	24968300	Feathers.
24968300	24970300	Feathers.
24970300	24972300	Feathers.
24972300	24974300	Feathers.
24974300	24976300	Feathers.
24976300	24978300	Feathers.
24978300	24980300	Feathers.
24980300	24982300	Feathers.
24982300	24984300	Feathers.
24984300	24986300	Feathers.
24986300	24988300	Oh, we're gonna do a brawl.
24988300	24990300	Uh... at the end of the stream
24990300	24997300	We're going to hop over the wall and fist fight each other and I'm going to get a rose and I'll give it to whoever wins the 50 cups.
24999300	25001300	Oh, pardon me, I'm broken.
25003300	25008300	Ok, in this shop you will need to buy a rod. Most of you already have one.
25009300	25011300	Ah, you guys so fast.
25011300	25017300	So trade with Garrett and then buy... oh no, there's only one.
25018300	25021300	That costs five coin, so buy one.
25022300	25025300	Do we need feathers or do we need the fishing bait?
25026300	25028300	Is it a fishing bait we need?
25030300	25032300	I made this tea so honey.
25035300	25038300	Oh that's sweet, that's too sweet. I can actually finish that.
25039300	25045300	All the sweetness is at the bottom. Feathers for trout and salmon.
25048300	25050300	Is that ticking up? Oh it is.
25055300	25057300	I don't have the money.
25058300	25059300	Or maybe I do.
25061300	25064300	Ok, that's all I can buy with what I've got.
25064300	25078300	I haven't got enough for anything else. I've got 73 feathers, I didn't think this far ahead.
25081300	25084300	I opened a stream and didn't see you here.
25088300	25090300	I wish this to trade with you, except trade.
25094300	25095300	Eh, I still have a key.
25096300	25100300	Oh, that's going to be a lot of feathers to spread about, not going to lie.
25101300	25103300	How do you have so much money?
25104300	25107300	Right, let me buy feathers for... what are these? Feather pack?
25108300	25109300	What's that?
25110300	25112300	I don't know. If I buy fifth... oh you can.
25115300	25118300	Oh, that's so smart! Inside the feather pack.
25119300	25121300	I'm going to keep some heels on me.
25122300	25125300	Right, I can give feather packs to reeflings.
25128300	25130300	Why does that not buy when I click it?
25132300	25135300	Wait, I'm dropping them! Oh, hold on, I'm being dumb.
25137300	25139300	I can trade the feather packs.
25140300	25143300	Ok, I've got like a thousand feathers now. Who needs feathers?
25145300	25147300	I think everyone needs feathers, honestly.
25147300	25150300	If you need feathers, trade me and I'll give you... wait, actually.
25151300	25153300	I should like give 200 feathers each?
25157300	25160300	I'll just say buy 50 and then I'll give 200 feathers.
25168300	25171300	I love spreading feathers on my...
25172300	25174300	Should we get a harpy? We should totally get a harpy.
25174300	25176300	I'm glad to take a feather pack.
25176300	25179300	Ok, trade me if you need feathers. I'll try and give you like 200.
25180300	25183300	Whose outfit is that? Is that even a reefling? Are you a reefling?
25183300	25186300	I don't know. I think that might just be someone caught in the crossfire.
25187300	25191300	Right, let's see. Accept and then offer...
25192300	25194300	200 and then we'll go fishing.
25195300	25196300	Accept.
25198300	25200300	Wait, what? Hold on.
25200300	25202300	Wait, wait, wait, wait, why did that not work?
25202300	25204300	200 and I...
25204300	25206300	Yeah. Oh, jeez. Sorry.
25207300	25209300	I don't know where that went. It just disappeared into space.
25211300	25214300	Ok, there's 200 for you and then there's two...
25215300	25216300	How dare you?
25219300	25220300	Just trying to see.
25223300	25224300	And then 200 for you.
25225300	25227300	And then sugar mummy.
25228300	25231300	You say that as if a reefling didn't just hand me all of his paycheck and runescape.
25233300	25236300	Where's Johnny at now? We're at Port Sarim.
25237300	25238300	We're on World 380.
25239300	25242300	We're currently at Port Sarim buying...
25243300	25245300	Ok, my PC just sped up trying to zoom that in.
25246300	25251300	And then we're going to go up to Barbarian Village to get salmon because there's a permanent fire there.
25257300	25259300	And we'll do 200.
25260300	25263300	No, I've done it again. Sorry. I keep teasing you with a feather.
25264300	25265300	I've done it again!
25267300	25268300	I can't stop teasing you right now.
25269300	25271300	I'm tickling you with the feathers.
25271300	25274300	I'm like, oh, do you want the feather and like tickle you and then run away with it?
25275300	25278300	Like pushing it against your face like ASMR and then like...
25280300	25282300	You need feathers too.
25282300	25286300	I'll buy a ton as well so when we head over there, we should be fine.
25286300	25290300	So if you need more, I can always get like always just trade more.
25291300	25293300	Teasing us with a feather, honestly.
25299300	25302300	Thank you, pretty lady. Played with me.
25305300	25308300	Has everyone got what they... Where the heck is the guy?
25308300	25310300	Where's the NPC to buy, awful?
25310300	25312300	I can't see. There's too many of us.
25313300	25315300	It's Miss. He's not for me.
25316300	25318300	Alright, where's the guy to buy freaking things off?
25318300	25319300	Oh, there he is.
25321300	25324300	Gonna buy like a bunch of feather packs and open them up.
25327300	25329300	Oh my god, have I already spent 10k on feathers?
25329300	25332300	Jeez, this game is not cheap. The economy's in shambles.
25337300	25340300	Right, that's like literally almost 5k. That's more than enough.
25340300	25343300	Does anyone else... You need some too.
25347300	25349300	Does that work? It did work, thank goodness.
25349300	25353300	How did you know that our weaknesses are feathers? Stop using your powers on us.
25353300	25356300	I don't think I ever thought of feathers. Did I do a tickling?
25356300	25361300	I may have got... I don't think I got... No, I think I got you tickling me artwork.
25362300	25363300	You're welcome.
25363300	25367300	Does anyone else need any feathers?
25367300	25369300	Or are we all ready to go?
25370300	25373300	We need to thank Sugar Daddy, Weflin...
25375300	25378300	The one that gave me poison that I thought was being bred.
25378300	25381300	I realised and I was like, I didn't accept the quest and had to loop with the chick.
25381300	25384300	Oh no, sorry, did you manage?
25384300	25386300	I could take some please.
25391300	25392300	Trade.
25392300	25395300	And then offer X amount.
25395300	25398300	Alright, has everyone got a rod? Not the one that's already attached to you.
25398300	25401300	One bought from the thing.
25401300	25405300	Were you giggling? Were you Sugar Daddy, Weflin and...
25405300	25406300	Giggling?
25413300	25415300	Kill... What's... What's heavier?
25415300	25416300	Kilograms.
25416300	25420300	Right, is everyone ready to do the walk? The walk.
25422300	25425300	Yes, I finished it. Oh no, you need some... Hold up.
25425300	25426300	Except trade.
25426300	25428300	We're getting there, we're getting there.
25429300	25431300	Wait, no, I don't... No, I don't need your rod.
25431300	25433300	Stop, I don't need your rod.
25433300	25435300	You keep your rod to yourself, Weflin.
25435300	25437300	It's not the time for that.
25442300	25443300	I do have a rod for vision.
25443300	25445300	Now I need some feathers, thanks.
25445300	25447300	Sugar would catch up me.
25447300	25451300	Right, is everyone ready to follow me and I'll take us to Barbarian?
25451300	25453300	You need a fly fishing rod for the fishes.
25454300	25457300	Oh, we need a specific type of rod. Of course we do.
25457300	25460300	What rod of alcohol? I've got a fishing rod.
25460300	25462300	I need a fly rod. Hold on, trade Garrett.
25466300	25467300	Fly fishing rod.
25467300	25472300	Right, does everyone have a fly fishing rod?
25472300	25474300	Before we move on to the next location.
25476300	25479300	Lesson two hour warning for Mercy Modest.
25480300	25481300	Nope.
25482300	25483300	Do you need...
25484300	25485300	Me...
25486300	25487300	To...
25488300	25489300	Oh.
25490300	25491300	I hope it restokes.
25491300	25492300	You're out.
25493300	25495300	I do have a pretty fly rod.
25495300	25497300	Pretty fly for a white guy.
25497300	25500300	You know it's kinda hard just to get along today.
25501300	25502300	He asked for...
25502300	25504300	What's that? He asked for ink.
25504300	25506300	He asked for a 13 year.
25506300	25508300	Instead they drew a fairy one.
25508300	25509300	It's a fairy one.
25520300	25522300	I don't know... They're not restocking.
25522300	25524300	They're like so slow to restock.
25525300	25526300	I don't know if I can...
25526300	25527300	Wait, we are...
25527300	25529300	We're gonna be right next to the grand exchange.
25529300	25531300	Maybe I'll buy some off the grand exchange.
25533300	25534300	I'll go with the grand exchange.
25534300	25535300	Yeah, okay.
25535300	25537300	We're gonna make it to the grand exchange.
25537300	25538300	Don't worry.
25538300	25540300	If you don't have a fly freshen rod,
25540300	25542300	we're gonna be very close to the grand exchange.
25542300	25543300	So don't worry.
25543300	25544300	You can follow me.
25545300	25546300	Follow Golden...
25546300	25547300	Golden me.
25548300	25550300	Is there any more reasons in that shop?
25550300	25551300	I actually can't tell.
25551300	25552300	The camera is like...
25552300	25554300	I'm sure there's a way to turn off first.
25554300	25555300	But...
25555300	25557300	Right, we'll follow...
25557300	25558300	Our...
25558300	25559300	Gated...
25559300	25561300	Our gate, our bunny gate.
25561300	25563300	A little hopsy.
25564300	25565300	I hope I'm right.
25565300	25566300	Yeah, okay.
25566300	25567300	This is in the...
25567300	25568300	The shop.
25568300	25569300	Everyone's here.
25571300	25573300	We're going to go to the grand exchange
25573300	25575300	to make sure everyone has a fly freshen rod
25575300	25578300	and to also deposit all of our items
25578300	25580300	because our inventory's getting like
25580300	25581300	pretty full of stuff.
25581300	25582300	And I don't want to be walking around
25582300	25583300	with like so much money.
25587300	25588300	Oh, there's the brawl.
25588300	25590300	This is where we're gonna do a bar brawl.
25591300	25592300	In a bar.
25597300	25598300	Da-da-da-da-da...
25598300	25600300	Do-a-da-da-da...

25604300	25605300	Ah!
25606300	25608300	You can always hover over
25608300	25609300	and then just say follow.
25611300	25612300	Follow...
25613300	25614300	Follow the leader, leader.
25614300	25615300	Oh, no, someone got stopped
25615300	25616300	by a mysterious old man.
25616300	25617300	Oh, you should always talk to
25617300	25619300	the mysterious old man
25619300	25620300	he'll give you, um...
25621300	25622300	Gemstone!
25622300	25623300	An uncut gemstone.
25623300	25624140	Put James in.
25625940	25627100	Okay, we're all ready.
25627100	25628660	Follow the leader leader.
25628660	25631380	Our ink shall block the sun.
25631380	25632740	I have 10 strongies.
25632740	25634180	I got some there already.
25634180	25635180	Okay, okay, okay.
25639180	25641580	Always talk to the mysterious old man, Godot.
25642460	25644660	Isn't that in...
25644660	25647300	Sometimes he gives you a maze to run through.
25647300	25648140	Oh.
25649380	25651540	The series old man giving uncut things.
25651620	25652460	Say yo.
25655020	25657700	The old man can offer to send you to solve a maze
25657700	25660060	and that one gives amazing rewards.
25660060	25661140	Okay, okay.
25662060	25664860	I know the signage lady doesn't give you anything good.
25664860	25668300	I'm like 99% sure she gives you a bit of cabbage or something.
25673220	25675420	I like this spinning one.
25675420	25676380	I can't remember what it is.
25676380	25677780	It's like the item spins around
25677780	25679740	and you have to identify it or something.
25679740	25682460	Amazing rewards.
25685580	25686820	Love that maze quest.
25686820	25687660	Love it.
25691220	25693460	Oh, it's going to skeal him.
25695460	25697420	No, it's not getting him.
25697420	25698340	Oh, I'm not too...
25698340	25699180	Two songs.
25702140	25702980	It's terrible.
25702980	25704140	It's absolutely terrible.
25710740	25711740	Oh, no.
25712740	25714740	Our biggest enemy, a bridge.
25714740	25716740	Right, we're going to go to the Grand Exchange
25716740	25718220	to empty our inventory
25718220	25722740	so we only have feathers and a fly fishing rod.
25723740	25724740	I don't...
25724740	25725740	There's a few fishers.
25725740	25727740	I don't know if they're bots or not.
25728740	25731740	As long as they're not talking,
25731740	25733740	then I think we'll be safe.
25733740	25736740	Because I don't want to turn off public traffic.
25737740	25739740	Because I don't want to turn off public chat
25739740	25741740	because it's fun having you guys talk
25741740	25743740	both in-game and in-stream.
25743740	25745740	It's where the real fishing begins.
25745740	25748740	The seventh grade computer lab day fishing.
25749740	25750740	Is it terrible?
25750740	25752740	No one is going to argue she wasn't that one.
25754740	25757740	Right, we're back at the Grand Exchange.
25762740	25765740	Right, where's the reefling that has the rods we desire?
25765740	25768740	For those reeflings who don't have a rod, please...
25769740	25771740	Reach out to...
25772740	25773740	To me.
25773740	25775740	To Kamin 1000.
25775740	25777740	If you don't have a rod...
25777740	25779740	I don't know where Kamin is.
25779740	25780740	I can't...
25781740	25783740	Oh, there, here, here.
25783740	25784740	There.
25784740	25787740	The one in the smithing cape.
25788740	25791740	If you don't have a fly fishing rod, trade then.
25791740	25793740	I'm going to put my stuff in the bank.
25793740	25795740	Uh, but...
25795740	25797740	Uh, this is not enough.
25799740	25803740	Let's just put everything in here other than...
25803740	25805740	Like, all of these?
25807740	25808740	Keep that...
25808740	25810740	Wait, why have I not got the money?
25811740	25813740	Oh no, I have a bear shield, that's why.
25813740	25815740	And then put that away.
25815740	25816740	And then put the fishing rod away.
25816740	25818740	And then put the money away.
25818740	25820740	Oh no, I didn't mean to click that.
25820740	25821740	Okay.
25821740	25823740	Okay, we did it.
25823740	25825740	We're ready to fish and cook.
25825740	25827740	Apparently everyone has a rod.
25827740	25828740	Jeez.
25829740	25830740	It must a...
25830740	25831740	A rod?
25832740	25833740	A fishing rod.
25834740	25835740	It's the mighty of the strange.
25835740	25837740	Old women in the forest isn't for...
25837740	25839740	Oh, there's so many strange requests.
25840740	25842740	Uh, I guess we're ready to take off
25842740	25844740	if everyone's emptied their inventory
25844740	25846740	and you should have a rod and feathers
25846740	25848740	and then we are going to go fishing
25848740	25850740	and level up our cooking eggs financially.
25850740	25851740	I'm ready.
25851740	25855740	All aboard the golden apron train.
25856740	25858740	I'll just make sure in case someone's stuck
25858740	25859740	at the bank right now.
25859740	25860740	It's kind of hard to tell,
25860740	25861740	because there's, like, somebody...
25861740	25862740	Oh no, there's only...
25863740	25865740	Rods are ready, everyone.
25865740	25867740	So few female reeflings.
25868740	25869740	And...
25869740	25871740	It is what it is.
25873740	25874740	Oh, wishes to trade with you?
25874740	25875740	Okay.
25875740	25876740	What's up?
25877740	25879740	Are you giving me your...
25879740	25880740	Are you giving me your banana?
25880740	25881740	Oh, yeah.
25884740	25885740	Wait, is this a thing?
25886740	25887740	No, it's not.
25887740	25888740	Okay.
25888740	25889740	I've just been given the banana.
25890740	25891740	Did you just finish?
25891740	25892740	Be honest.
25892740	25893740	Oh, I ate it.
25893740	25894740	I'm sorry.
25894740	25895740	I just ate it right in front of you.
25895740	25896740	I'm sorry.
25896740	25897740	I just ate your banana.
25898740	25899740	Wait, is that everyone?
25903740	25905740	Can I store it somewhere
25905740	25906740	or just drop stuff off?
25906740	25907740	Oh, yeah.
25907740	25910740	So, do you see over here how it says
25910740	25912740	bank banker?
25913740	25915740	And then click on your inventory
25915740	25916740	and it'll put it in the bank.
25916740	25918740	So, this empties out your inventory.
25918740	25919740	The only thing you want right now
25919740	25921740	is a fly fishing rod and feathers.
25922740	25923740	Banana or banana?
25925740	25927740	It's a treat all over again.
25927740	25929740	I actually had a lot of fun making that to me.
25929740	25930740	I don't know what it's...
25930740	25933740	I don't know if it's gotten more popular or not.
25933740	25935740	But when I woke up, it was, like,
25935740	25936740	1,000 likes and I'm like,
25936740	25938740	ooh, that's a lot, I mean.
25943740	25945740	Okay, that should hopefully be it.
25947740	25949740	And then we'll take all the reeflings away.
25949740	25951740	Actually, we'll...
25951740	25953740	Well, I don't know if all the reeflings are ready yet.
25954740	25955740	Thank you, God.
25957740	25961740	She just ate that man's banana live on public.
25961740	25963740	On stream in public in front of everyone.
25964740	25967740	Okay, is that all reeflings?
25967740	25968740	I like my name so...
25968740	25970740	Oh, no, one more, one more.
25971740	25972740	There's one more reefling.
25974740	25975740	Look at that fit.
25975740	25977740	Look at the feet size difference.
25978740	25980740	Okay, we now follow
25981740	25983740	the reeflings I thought was making a threat
25983740	25985740	via the poison in fishfish.
25988740	25989740	That video was good.
25990740	25994740	Okay, reeflings, we're going to Barbarian Village.
25994740	25996740	Hopefully there's no bots talking.
25996740	25998740	I'm probably just gonna click ignore
25998740	26001740	if there's any bots so we don't have to world hop
26001740	26003740	because this is a pretty quiet world in general.
26004740	26005740	Yeah, it was great.
26005740	26006740	I lost that video.
26007740	26008740	Really?
26010740	26013740	I was, like, wondering should I, like, overcomplement...
26013740	26015740	overcomplicate it and, like, say,
26015740	26016740	like, certain words, phrase or whatever.
26016740	26017740	And I was, like, no.
26017740	26019740	Just be super simple about it.
26019740	26020740	So I was...
26022740	26023740	Did it.
26025740	26026740	Right.
26026740	26030740	Okay, so this is Barbarian fishing section.
26030740	26034740	It's normally bought it, but I don't know.
26034740	26035740	These may be real people.
26035740	26038740	This is the best, like, free-to-play area.
26038740	26039740	We'll do here.
26039740	26041740	We'll lure our fishing rod.
26043740	26044740	And how are you a cow?
26044740	26046740	You were a bunny a second ago.
26048740	26050740	Oh, I've already caught a fish.
26051740	26053740	Whoa, the fishing is so fast.
26055740	26058740	Oh, my God, really gonna be levelling up so quickly.
26064740	26066740	Well, once whatever you catch,
26066740	26069740	there's a pair of my fire over here that we can cook on.
26070740	26073740	Everyone did get level 20 fishing, right?
26073740	26075740	Or I've just dragged you over here for nothing.
26077740	26079740	I hope everyone's...
26082740	26084740	Oh, you're all up to 20?
26091740	26093740	Oh, no, I thought everyone was 20 fishing.
26093740	26094740	I'm so sorry.
26096740	26098740	Oh, I'm not level 20.
26098740	26099740	No.
26102740	26105740	My suggestion, if you're not level 20,
26105740	26108740	you need to get that net and go back to the thing.
26108740	26109740	I joined late.
26109740	26111740	I'll level in dreams night later.
26113740	26115740	Not me, but I'll jump over and get a quick view of it.
26117740	26119740	Oh, no, there's a banana on the floor.
26119740	26120740	Random banana.
26125740	26128740	So, only that video in your altar is one of the hottest.
26128740	26129740	Oh.
26132740	26133740	How many likes is that?
26133740	26135740	I'm allowed to know.
26136740	26138740	If you aren't level 20,
26138740	26142740	I would suggest going back to Lumbridge.
26142740	26144740	Teleport to Lumbridge.
26144740	26147740	Get your small fishing net out the bank at the top
26147740	26150740	and then go back to that spot until you're 20.
26150740	26152740	And then coming here...
26153740	26154740	Well, I'm already level 21.
26154740	26156740	Jesus, so much faster doing this.
26156740	26157740	It's crazy.
26158740	26159740	Is that 1.4?
26159740	26160740	Okay, we'll go.
26161740	26163740	How long has people enjoyed it?
26163740	26164740	That's the main thing.
26168740	26170740	What level to bait fish here?
26170740	26172740	I'm not sure.
26172740	26174740	I only brought feathers for fly fish.
26177740	26178740	No comment.
26184740	26186740	Should I do a burp at the end of one of them?
26186740	26187740	Maybe I should.
26187740	26188740	They're like a burp version.
26191740	26192740	Hmm.
26194740	26195740	But yes.
26196740	26199740	We're probably going to be here for like a hot second.
26200740	26203740	Mercy's going up in an hour 40.
26203740	26205740	So honestly, I think for the rest of the stream,
26205740	26206740	we're going to be here.
26206740	26208740	So if you want to level up to 20 cooking,
26208740	26210740	you certainly can.
26210740	26212740	Sorry, 20 fishing.
26212740	26214740	And then like come back here.
26214740	26216740	Like we'll probably most likely be here.
26217740	26222740	And hopefully I can stop burning fish
26222740	26224740	and then I can start burning through the supplies
26224740	26226740	that were gifted because like I think I got like
26226740	26228740	2000 fish gifted to me.
26228740	26229740	I'll be back.
26229740	26230740	Good luck.
26230740	26231740	Yeah.
26231740	26232740	Have a good time.
26232740	26235740	You can teleport via your magic spells.
26235740	26237740	Get on to, yeah.
26237740	26240740	Get to Lumberge again and do that small thing
26240740	26243740	and then come back here once you've got your fly fishing rod.
26243740	26245740	And I've got loads of feathers on me.
26246740	26247740	Yeah.
26252740	26254740	This is where the ground begins.
26254740	26257740	We are currently at 25 cooking.
26257740	26258740	Which is decent.
26258740	26260740	I wanted to get 40 before stream.
26260740	26263740	I think 40 is part of that cow animation.
26263740	26267740	I think 40 is 40 realistic before
26267740	26269740	Mercy goes live.
26269740	26270740	I'm not sure.
26270740	26271740	I'm not sure.
26271740	26273740	Bait fishing is 25.
26273740	26274740	Oh, that's even worse.
26274740	26278740	How do you get grapes, actually?
26278740	26280740	From the Grand Exchange?
26280740	26283740	I don't actually know where you harvest them.
26287740	26288740	Tea time.
26289740	26291740	We're actually going to get decent level in fishing.
26291740	26292740	Yeah.
26292740	26293740	Whoa.
26293740	26294740	It's 50 eggs per fish.
26294740	26296740	That's quite a lot.
26296740	26298740	All things considered.
26298740	26301740	I'm going to level up in fishing again
26301740	26303740	on this one stalk of inland water.
26305740	26306740	Yeah.
26311740	26314740	Oh, that's a lot of trout on the floor.
26314740	26317740	That's literally 10k worth of fish.
26317740	26321740	13k XP per hour.
26321740	26322740	If you don't cook the fish.
26322740	26324740	Yeah, we're going to have to stop and use this fire.
26324740	26328740	But this is a permanent fire that we can utilize for ourselves.
26328740	26330740	Which is fantastic.
26331740	26333740	Would it make sense to just buy them in bulk?
26333740	26336740	Yeah, especially if you do that route and just buy 66.
26336740	26339740	Oh, that would be daunting.
26339740	26342740	But it's definitely a possibility.
26348740	26353740	I'm wondering, maybe we could do react andy content.
26355740	26358740	I don't know if there's stuff that's safe for YouTube reaction.
26358740	26360740	Whilst we do this.
26360740	26362740	Because don't get me wrong.
26362740	26363740	I'm entertaining.
26363740	26368740	But I don't think I'm that entertaining for like a 30 hour grind.
26368740	26370740	If I was doing grapes.
26372740	26374740	Oh, just do the last one.
26375740	26380740	So maybe we put stuff on in the background.
26382740	26386740	70 eggs pee for cooking trout.
26386740	26388740	Whoa.
26390740	26392740	That's so fast.
26392740	26395740	We're literally 26 already.
26396740	26398740	That is so fast.
26398740	26400740	We need Minecraft parkour.
26400740	26403740	Subway surfers in the bottom stream.
26406740	26408740	70 is so much.
26408740	26411740	When we unlock salmon, I don't even know how much salmon is.
26411740	26413740	XP wise.
26413740	26415740	Oh, stop burning it.
26415740	26417740	Stop burning it.
26421740	26423740	Oh.
26429740	26432740	Just put some surfers in the corner.
26436740	26439740	Yeah, so this is like free grinding as well.
26439740	26441740	To pick up this fish that people drop.
26443740	26447740	Oh, we literally went on two cooking levels doing one batch of fish.
26447740	26449740	That's crazy.
26451740	26453740	I'm so fast.
26456740	26458740	Here, fishy fishy.
26458740	26460740	We need to be quiet.
26460740	26462740	Salmon or 90 cooking eggs pee.
26462740	26464740	Okay, that will be good.
26464740	26467740	I'll listen to you whenever, but I've lost my mind entirely.
26467740	26469740	See you tomorrow. Rest well.
26469740	26471740	Please rest well.
26471740	26473740	Gotta get up tomorrow with Khan.
26473740	26475740	Oh, fun time.
26475740	26477740	Oh my god, it's Rinscape in real life.
26478740	26480740	It's trying to get easily watched.
26480740	26482740	There has been nothing but yapping.
26482740	26484740	It's because of my voice.
26484740	26486740	It's so sore.
26486740	26488740	My face meant no dragon.
26488740	26490740	Harpoon specking on free world.
26490740	26492740	Oof.
26498740	26501740	Wow, wow, wow.
26501740	26504740	I haven't seen it for a while.
26504740	26506740	Honestly, we...
26506740	26509740	We thought we were going to do 40 before Mercy comes on,
26509740	26513740	but we managed to like fish to high heaven.
26513740	26515740	We might be past 40.
26515740	26517740	I don't know. I don't want to jinx it, but...
26517740	26521740	40 on the first Rinscape stream seems pretty decent work.
26521740	26523740	And we also did fun questing.
26526740	26528740	We got how many quests?
26528740	26530740	One, two...
26530740	26532740	I'm gonna go so fast.
26532740	26534740	One, two...
26534740	26536740	Three, four, five...
26536740	26538740	Six and seven.
26538740	26540740	Well, maybe do...
26540740	26542740	A few more.
26542740	26544740	23!
26544740	26547740	Got overtime tomorrow, so I'm gonna have to...
26547740	26549740	So I have plenty of listening time.
26551740	26553740	For anyone that needs to go to sleep
26553740	26555740	or you need to go do some things,
26555740	26557740	please do not worry. You're not missing out on much.
26557740	26560740	This is literally the gameplay for the next hour and a half.
26560740	26562740	I'm not even kidding.
26562740	26564740	We're just fishing and then a...
26564740	26566740	We're catching the fish and then cooking them
26566740	26568740	and then leveling up cooking.
26568740	26570740	Are you squidding me right now?
26570740	26571740	Brian!
26575740	26577740	Hi Tiny Spinny!
26577740	26579740	Hope you had fun at work.
26579740	26582740	We are currently in World 3A
26582740	26585740	and we are in Barbarian Village.
26585740	26587740	We're fishing.
26587740	26589740	So the Grand Exchange,
26589740	26591740	Varrock, Telopore,
26591740	26593740	and we're at the fishing village.
26593740	26595740	We have a fly fishing rod
26595740	26597740	and we have a feather
26597740	26599740	and we're catching the fish and cooking them
26599740	26601740	on the perma...
26601740	26603740	cookie thing.
26603740	26605740	Once I'm experienced enough
26605740	26607740	not to burn fish,
26607740	26609740	I most likely will cook all the fish
26609740	26611740	that the reeflings gave me
26611740	26613740	because I don't want them to go to waste
26613740	26615740	because that was a lot of money
26615740	26617740	that the reeflings handed me.
26618740	26620740	I don't...
26620740	26621740	I'll cook all of that
26621740	26622740	and see where we are.
26622740	26624740	I think lobsters...
26624740	26626740	I've got quite a few lobsters.
26626740	26628740	Trout, salmon, all of that.
26628740	26630740	So we're going to cook all of that.
26630740	26633740	I don't think we're going to be on Wains
26633740	26635740	by the time Mercy comes on.
26638740	26641740	I think tomorrow's my eighth more stream.
26642740	26644740	So I definitely need to try and rest my voice
26644740	26646740	so that it's going to be so smooth.
26647740	26649740	I'm ready for another 2AM YAP session.
26649740	26651740	We're listening to the Scottish last.
26652740	26653740	I've got plenty of YAP
26653740	26654740	and we're like, I'm slow.
26654740	26656740	Oh, someone's got a mini...
26657740	26658740	mini quest.
26658740	26659740	A toot!
26659740	26661740	A toot free power.
26661740	26662740	A toot free power.
26669740	26670740	Such a tent feeling free.
26670740	26671740	Oh my God, it's so intense.
26671740	26673740	Wait, I'm not even fishing anyone.
26673740	26675740	That's probably the only thing that kills me
26675740	26676740	about this game,
26676740	26678740	like when it comes to fishing and stuff.
26678740	26680740	It's when the boxes move.
26682740	26684740	But it is very tempting to,
26686740	26688740	like, pick up all the fish that are already here
26688740	26690740	and just do that and spawn that.
26690740	26692740	Lobsters require 40 cookies
26692740	26693740	so it might be a while.
26693740	26694740	I don't want to burn them.
26695740	26697740	Here we are going to 4AM.
26697740	26698740	I'm ready for...
26699740	26702740	Yes, so if you want to join in
26702740	26703740	some say hi.
26703740	26705740	World 380
26705740	26707740	and Barbarian Village Fishing Sport.
26707740	26708740	Free to play.
26708740	26709740	Free to play.
26709740	26711740	Well, cheeky free to play.
26712740	26715740	If I get the RuneScape...
26716740	26719740	If I do end up getting the Cookin' Cape,
26719740	26720740	we might take a break
26720740	26722740	but I wouldn't mind doing membership quests
26722740	26723740	at some point
26723740	26725740	because I've never actually done them
26725740	26726740	and I'm too scared to do them on my own
26726740	26727740	but if you guys are with me,
26727740	26728740	I'm not scared.
26729740	26732740	Yes, I think tomorrow's ASMR stream
26732740	26735740	and then day after is trying sweet.
26737740	26739740	And then after is Skyrim
26739740	26740740	and I get to rant...
26740740	26741740	No, not rant, sorry.
26741740	26745740	I get to mumble away about Skyrim for ages.
26746740	26749740	Lobsters have a 60% chance to burn at level 40.
26749740	26751740	Yeah, I'm not wasting Lobsters there.
26752740	26754740	That is rough.
26754740	26755740	That's rough.
26756740	26758740	I don't want to waste a lot of weight
26758740	26760740	because that was so much better rather than...
26760740	26763740	But we're like leveling up our fishing so easily.
26765740	26767740	Right, we are full.
26767740	26769740	Let's see, can we get two levels out of this
26769740	26770740	if we don't burn them?
26770740	26772740	It burns the first one.
26775740	26776740	Dude, waterfall fires.
26776740	26778740	It gets you to combat level 30.
26778740	26779740	What?
26779740	26780740	Really?
26781740	26782740	I know I got some quests
26782740	26784740	really give you a lot of XP
26784740	26786740	but I can't wait for those more
26786740	26787740	but I'm lucky for the time.
26787740	26789740	Maybe I'll cast a bit later.
26793740	26795740	Don't worry if you can't make it to any stream.
26795740	26796740	I think the boss will stay up
26796740	26799740	and I'm not going to be doing ear licking
26799740	26802740	because something weird is going on with YouTube.
26803740	26805740	It's going on a little weird with YouTube
26805740	26806740	and I don't know what's going on
26806740	26808740	so I'm not risking it.
26809740	26812740	As I gave you all those lobs
26812740	26814740	you can burn them if you need to.
26816740	26818740	I'd rather not waste the XP
26818740	26820740	like if it was potential full XP
26820740	26823740	like it's okay to burn these trout for example.
26825740	26827740	Oh come on, one more and I'll level up.
26827740	26828740	Okay, there we go.
26829740	26830740	20.
26830740	26831740	Aw yeah.
26832740	26834740	I want 40 before Mercy comes online.
26834740	26836740	We're under the cock roof limbs.
26838740	26839740	We're under the cock.
26840740	26841740	Empty inventory.
26841740	26842740	Let's get it.
26842740	26843740	I don't know if I should fish
26843740	26845740	or if I should honestly
26845740	26847740	just put my stuff away and pick up
26847740	26848740	but if everyone was picking up
26848740	26849740	what was put on the floor
26849740	26852740	then we wouldn't have enough trout to go around.
26858740	26860740	Where would be the first ASMR?
26860740	26862740	Hopefully YouTube will get off.
26864740	26866740	No, it's like cracking down everywhere
26866740	26868740	on anime ASMR in particular.
26868740	26871740	If you want to call it anime ASMR.
26873740	26875740	It'll be faster to loot the fish
26875740	26877740	if you just want to do a cooking.
26877740	26879740	That's what I'm thinking.
26880740	26882740	If I just do that instead.
26886740	26888740	It's nice to get the level of XP
26888740	26891740	but I'm gonna like blast the head of you reeflings
26891740	26892740	if I do that.
26892740	26894740	Would you guys be upset if I picked up trout?
26895740	26896740	Hopefully not.
26897740	26899740	It would blast me forward though.
26899740	26901740	Like, compared to everyone's level.
26907740	26908740	Go for it.
26911740	26912740	What do I need?
26912740	26913740	I just need trout.
26913740	26914740	I can't cook salmon
26914740	26915740	because I'm too low level.
26915740	26917740	Wait, examine?
26918740	26920740	No, I don't want salmon.
26920740	26921740	I can't cook it.
26922740	26923740	I want trout.
26924740	26925740	Right.
26925740	26927740	We'll see how far this gets me ahead
26927740	26929740	if I do this method where I don't fish.
26929740	26932740	Maybe you guys can drop the fish for me
26932740	26934740	and we get fish train going.
26934740	26935740	There's two more.
26936740	26937740	Right, let's cook this batch.
26937740	26939740	Let's see what happens.
26939740	26941740	I like fish.
26941740	26943740	The fish are so amazing too.
26946740	26948740	Basically, if you can't see what they're actually doing
26948740	26949740	they're assuming it's like,
26949740	26951740	Yes, I think that's what the problem is.
26951740	26952740	Why?
26952740	26953740	In real life it's fine,
26953740	26955740	but anime's getting wapped with it.
26957740	26958740	I say anime,
26958740	26959740	beach over animation.
26959740	26960740	You know what I mean.
26961740	26963740	Anyway, it starts blasting.
26965740	26967740	We're fish slaves, let's go.
26968740	26970740	Sounds a bit fishy, but okay.
26977740	26978740	Are we gonna make it?
26978740	26979740	I think we are.
26980740	26981740	I said this.
26983740	26985740	No idea when I said that.
26988740	26989740	29 already?
26989740	26991740	Oh my god, this is so fast.
26991740	26993740	I'm saying it's fast now
26993740	26995740	because it's gonna be so slow later,
26995740	26996740	but I'm happy.
26997740	27000740	I only burnt four from that batch as well.
27000740	27004740	That trout is getting cooked to perfection by me, honestly.
27005740	27007740	I see trout, I see trout.
27010740	27012740	I don't know, those are cooked trout.
27013740	27015740	Right, I'm gonna have to fish and go fish.
27015740	27017740	Oh wait, someone wants to trade with me, hold on.
27021740	27023740	You'll never guess what.
27023740	27024740	It's trout.
27028740	27029740	Oh no, you cancelled.
27029740	27031740	Oh, you don't have enough inspiratory space.
27031740	27032740	Oh no, sorry.
27033740	27035740	I don't know how many I've got left.
27035740	27036740	Like,
27037740	27039740	space for freaking...
27039740	27040740	Yeah.
27042740	27044740	Trade modified.
27044740	27045740	Blink, blink, blink.
27045740	27047740	I saw serious, literally.
27047740	27048740	I don't know if that's too much.
27048740	27049740	Oh no.
27049740	27050740	Is it?
27050740	27051740	Oh, you failed me.
27051740	27052740	Oh, my inventory.
27052740	27053740	You failed my inventory.
27053740	27055740	Thank you, beef knife.
27061740	27062740	That's terrible.
27062740	27064740	But thank you very much, we've blown.
27064740	27066740	It's running out of here playing cooking, mummy.
27066740	27067740	Literally, I'm feeding.
27067740	27071740	You don't get 100% success on trout until 49.
27071740	27072740	That's so rough.
27072740	27074740	I don't remember it being so like that.
27086740	27088740	We're already gonna level up again.
27090740	27092740	I don't know when we unlock being able to cook salmon,
27092740	27093740	but it's gonna be soon.
27093740	27096740	Gonna drop all the trout in the south spot of salmon here.
27096740	27097740	Yeah.
27097740	27099740	If you don't overlap on the salmon,
27099740	27101740	it makes it so easy to pick up.
27101740	27103740	Wow, we're already up there.
27103740	27104740	Oh my god.
27104740	27106740	Are we gonna be 50 by the time mercy?
27108740	27110740	We may, honestly.
27113740	27115740	I'm cooking by gas.
27115740	27117740	I'm cooking the best I can.
27117740	27119740	Okay, we had like way more burnt in that batch,
27119740	27121740	so it really is just randomized.
27122740	27124740	Let's empty our inventory,
27124740	27126740	and then let's grab all these trout.
27133740	27135740	I'm over there, hating.
27135740	27137740	Oh wait, sorry.
27139740	27141740	I don't know if you have to take into account
27141740	27144740	how much inventory space I have.
27147740	27148740	Okay.
27148740	27149740	Yeah.
27149740	27152740	As long as you put whatever inventory.
27158740	27161740	Oh my god.
27161740	27163740	Loves yourself six percent.
27165740	27168740	The key to power leveling is slave teamwork.
27168740	27171740	Honestly, we're doing pretty good.
27172740	27175740	We're already launching the 30s.
27176740	27180740	I think we can fly past the 40s, honestly.
27180740	27181740	Hi, Stronia.
27181740	27182740	Been away from us today.
27182740	27184740	How's it going?
27184740	27188740	We have done some quests, some free play quests.
27188740	27191740	We are currently at Barbarian Village,
27191740	27195740	and I'm currently using the reflames
27195740	27197740	to slave fish for me,
27197740	27198740	so we're getting trout,
27198740	27202740	and I'm currently leveling up like crazy right now.
27203740	27206740	Every batch of trout is making me go up another level.
27206740	27208740	I'm already 31 cooking.
27210740	27214740	We're messing around, having fun on quests.
27214740	27216740	And now I'm just doing...
27216740	27218740	I'm actually tempted to go to the Grand Exchange to...
27218740	27220740	Oh, sorry, I'm pressing the wrong button.
27220740	27223740	I'm tempted to go to the Grand Exchange
27223740	27226740	to drop the fish and rod off,
27226740	27229740	just to do full inventories as well.
27229740	27230740	I think I may.
27230740	27232740	I'm going to be right back, reflames, okay?
27232740	27236740	I'm going to drop the feathers and the fish and rod away,
27236740	27237740	that you guys can stay.
27237740	27239740	Don't worry, don't get separation anxiety.
27239740	27240740	I'll be right back.
27240740	27243740	Mummy's going to the Grand Exchange and back again.
27243740	27244740	You'll be okay.
27244740	27246740	It's fine.
27246740	27248740	Mummy will be right back.
27248740	27249740	See, I'm across the water.
27249740	27250740	Bye-bye.
27250740	27251740	I'll be right back.
27253740	27254740	Literally.
27254740	27256740	All right, I just need to drop this off
27256740	27258740	so I can have full...
27258740	27259740	No, not the book.
27259740	27260740	Not the booth.
27260740	27261740	I want the bank.
27261740	27263740	I'm trying to see if I can do it through the ceiling.
27263740	27264740	I can't.
27266740	27267740	She's never coming back.
27267740	27268740	I'm coming back.
27268740	27270740	I just need to bank the banker.
27272740	27273740	There, there, there.
27273740	27274740	See, look, empty.
27274740	27275740	Look, I'm already running back.
27275740	27276740	I'm running out of stamina.
27276740	27277740	It's okay.
27277740	27278740	I'm a wee bit tired.
27278740	27279740	I'm getting a wee bit tired.
27279740	27280740	45.
27280740	27281740	Stamina.
27282740	27283740	Wah, wah, wah.
27284740	27285740	I'm coming back.
27285740	27286740	I'm coming back.
27287740	27288740	We're orphans!
27288740	27289740	No!
27291740	27292740	You can't be, you can't be, you can't be.
27292740	27293740	See, look, look, look, I'm back.
27293740	27294740	Look, who's that?
27294740	27295740	Who's that?
27295740	27296740	That's right.
27296740	27297740	I'm on the other side of the water.
27297740	27298740	Boom.
27298740	27299740	I'm coming to pick up that trout
27299740	27300740	that's on the floor there
27300740	27301740	because there's tons.
27301740	27303740	Oh, the renaissance of the fire as well.
27305740	27307740	See, we have no home.
27307740	27309740	See, look, I'm literally right here.
27310740	27312740	Is there so dramatic?
27312740	27314740	See, of all the trout.
27315740	27318740	I'm max leveling up.
27318740	27321740	I'm going to pick up all the ones on the floor.
27321740	27323740	It's better to drop the trout.
27323740	27325740	It's faster to drop it.
27326740	27329740	Who dares the spots picking up?
27329740	27330740	It's faster to drop the trout
27330740	27332740	than it is to trade me.
27332740	27334740	Right, okay, full inventory.
27336740	27339740	We're going to be in the 50s after this.
27339740	27341740	There's no way we're not.
27342740	27345740	What were you doing with all those people
27345740	27347740	in the business room?
27347740	27349740	Dropping trout.
27349740	27351740	Trout.
27351740	27353740	Oh, pardon me.
27353740	27355740	Trout.
27355740	27356740	Trout.
27356740	27358740	The fish.
27358740	27359740	Trout.
27359740	27360740	Trout.
27360740	27362740	You don't need to see the sea
27362740	27363740	at the end.
27363740	27364740	Dropping trout.
27365740	27367740	There's loads of words that I say like that.
27367740	27369740	I can't believe it.
27370740	27373740	Check your XP per hour on the bar.
27377740	27379740	Why is it not displaying?
27380740	27381740	This is I'm cooking.
27381740	27384740	Cooked 92, 93 per hour burn.
27384740	27386740	23% burn rate.
27386740	27388740	Why is it not displaying?
27388740	27390740	I'm cooking though.
27391740	27393740	It's not like telling me.
27393740	27394740	Literally level 20.
27394740	27396740	It's not like telling me.
27399740	27400740	Hmm.
27403740	27404740	Trout.
27404740	27406740	It's short for trousers.
27409740	27410740	Oh, this one.
27410740	27412740	Oh, now we're talking.
27412740	27413740	Hold on.
27413740	27415740	Let me drop all these.
27416740	27419740	It says for not fishing.
27419740	27420740	Cooking.
27420740	27421740	Where is cooking?
27421740	27423740	Where's cooking?
27424740	27425740	Here.
27425740	27426740	Cooking's purple.
27426740	27428740	Why would it be purple honestly?
27429740	27430740	Let me grab all these trout.
27430740	27432740	There's like so much on the floor honestly.
27434740	27435740	I can't keep up.
27435740	27436740	There's so much.
27439740	27444740	It says I'm gaining 2,000 XP per hour.
27446740	27447740	Oh, there's trout here.
27447740	27448740	Trout, trout, trout.
27449740	27450740	No, the trout.
27450740	27451740	Not the fire.
27452740	27454740	Now I've got to fill inventory.
27456740	27457740	Let's see.
27458740	27461740	XP gained 16 hour, roughly 2k,
27461740	27463740	but it's probably going to go up for a bit
27463740	27466740	because I'm not being done fill trout and XP left.
27467740	27470740	Oh no, it's getting covered up by the freaking layer.
27475740	27476740	I'm coming back in.
27476740	27478740	We're at Barbarian Village
27478740	27480740	at the free play fishing spot.
27482740	27484740	But I think we're definitely higher.
27484740	27486740	Yeah, this is going up.
27486740	27488740	It says we're now 2.3 per hour.
27488740	27490740	It's because we've not done it for an hour, but...
27491740	27492740	Once we have...
27492740	27493740	It says...
27493740	27495740	Actually, I don't know if you can see that.
27496740	27497740	Of course not.
27497740	27500740	It literally says like six actions left
27500740	27503740	and then we've leveled up, so that's really good.
27503740	27504740	I like that.
27504740	27506740	It kind of puts into perspective
27506740	27508740	how much you need to do in order to get next.
27508740	27509740	Next.
27513740	27515740	You can write...
27515740	27517740	Literally level 33.
27518740	27520740	You can reset.
27521740	27522740	I'll just leave that.
27524740	27525740	That's the only burnt two.
27525740	27527740	Oh, burnt three that time.
27531740	27533740	They don't burn three that time.
27534740	27536740	I'm so MLG pro.
27539740	27542740	Oh, I shouldn't maybe drop the trout here.
27546740	27548740	I don't know when I can start cooking salmon,
27548740	27550740	but it should be sent to you.
27555740	27557740	She needs that raw fish meat.
27557740	27559740	Are you treating me fish?
27561740	27563740	Oh no, I don't have inventory for that.
27563740	27564740	Is that tuna?
27564740	27566740	I'm pretty sure that's tuna.
27566740	27567740	Sorry, I don't have any...
27567740	27569740	Oh, you're giving me three tuna?
27569740	27573740	I don't even think I'm like leveling enough to do that.
27573740	27574740	What are you?
27574740	27576740	Use tuna on the fire.
27576740	27577740	Oh, I can.
27577740	27578740	Oh, it's not tuna.
27578740	27579740	Oh, what is it?
27579740	27580740	It's tuna.
27581740	27582740	Oh, burnt it.
27583740	27585740	It's 100 XP.
27585740	27587740	Wait, that's more XP than salmon.
27591740	27592740	Okay.
27593740	27594740	Reset.
27594740	27595740	It seems to have bugged out.
27595740	27596740	Okay, I'll reset.
27596740	27598740	Sorry, reset.
27600740	27601740	Oh, I know it's not the bomb.
27601740	27603740	Oh, you can actually see it though, no?
27604740	27606740	Tuna max and right now,
27606740	27607740	Manstronia just really...
27607740	27611740	That you and my definition of fun are completely different.
27611740	27614740	I mean, I'm literally becoming a little chef.
27614740	27617740	I'm able to feed all the reeflings like this now.
27620740	27622740	Oh, she'll be getting all the thingies.
27622740	27624740	Oh, it says I have nine actions left.
27624740	27625740	That's so cool.
27625740	27628740	That says like you literally have a number.
27628740	27630740	Because soon it will be like 100 left
27630740	27631740	and then it'll be 1000 left
27631740	27633740	and I'll be like, that's fine.
27634740	27636740	Her numbers are going way up.
27636740	27638740	Literally, this is like...
27638740	27642740	If you like slow incremental games that feel satisfying,
27642740	27645740	RuneScape is definitely for you.
27645740	27648740	I've never 99 something
27648740	27650740	and I want to do it
27650740	27653740	and you guys can hold me accountable for it.
27653740	27655740	I'll literally tuna max and so whatever.
27655740	27656740	Who's got trout up for me?
27656740	27657740	No, that's cooked trout.
27657740	27659740	That's raw trout, okay.
27659740	27661740	Oh wait, is this accept trade?
27661740	27662740	Do you got more tuna?
27662740	27664740	It's the tuna man.
27665740	27666740	Of course, it's fun.
27666740	27667740	Numbers goes up.
27667740	27669740	Don't for me and we all get literally...
27670740	27673740	Wow, thank you so much for the tuna.
27673740	27675740	How is everyone today?
27675740	27676740	Someone asks.
27677740	27679740	We're...
27679740	27681740	We're tuna max...
27681740	27682740	No, not tuna.
27682740	27684740	Oh, I was talking.
27684740	27685740	I was taking...
27685740	27686740	Are you squiddin' me right now?
27686740	27687740	Brian!
27687740	27689740	We love when numbers go up,
27689740	27691740	so have some numbers.
27691740	27694740	Oh, money's different.
27694740	27697740	Thank you for the tip, don't do that.
27697740	27699740	We do love money going up
27699740	27701740	in incremental video games.
27703740	27706740	We're playing Cooking Sim
27706740	27708740	and it's amazing.
27708740	27710740	Hope...
27710740	27712740	Hope your day is going well.
27712740	27714740	Smile if you see.
27714740	27716740	Always be nice to people.
27717740	27720740	I am burning the absolute living
27720740	27721740	daylights out of this tuna.
27721740	27722740	I'm so sorry.
27722740	27724740	I've just wasted all that tuna.
27726740	27727740	So sorry.
27729740	27731740	I have been here for like four hours.
27733740	27735740	Oh, I keep messing it up.
27735740	27736740	I wonder if you could sell cooked tuna
27736740	27737740	for decent money.
27737740	27739740	I don't think it's a cheap fish.
27739740	27741740	I seem to think like...
27741740	27743740	Alright, raw trout time.
27746740	27748740	Uh, fishing levels?
27748740	27750740	Uh, um...
27750740	27752740	Anya?
27752740	27753740	What the fuck?
27753740	27754740	Runescape message saying
27754740	27755740	I'm going to be logged in
27755740	27756740	in 30 minutes, max six hours play.
27756740	27758740	Wait, is that real?
27758740	27760740	Wait, you got more tuna already?
27760740	27762740	Wait, you can't have.
27763740	27765740	How are you doing?
27767740	27768740	Are you peddling tuna to me
27768740	27770740	to level me up faster?
27770740	27771740	I feel like I'm wasting all your
27771740	27772740	tuna.
27774740	27775740	Oh, no.
27777740	27779740	Wait, are we finally doing it?
27779740	27780740	Are we...
27780740	27782740	Are we got tuna slave runners?
27784740	27786740	Yeah, it's like there was log is real.
27786740	27787740	Wait, am I going to be booted out
27787740	27789740	or because I bought membership
27789740	27791740	I'm not going to be booted out.
27791740	27793740	I have plenty of tuna.
27793740	27795740	I could literally buy a million.
27797740	27798740	Hey, Strony.
27798740	27800740	Am I in trouble for cooking
27800740	27801740	my own food tonight?
27801740	27802740	Does that mean I could just jump
27802740	27803740	into the kitchen?
27803740	27805740	You're allowed to make it.
27807740	27808740	He...
27808740	27809740	That is messed up.
27809740	27810740	I'm not a child.
27810740	27811740	Literally why is the game
27811740	27813740	doing it for like bandwidth issues?
27813740	27815740	If you're a free member,
27815740	27817740	they're like, oh, we've had enough of you.
27817740	27819740	Strony becomes a master chef
27819740	27820740	but can't fight a rat.
27820740	27822740	No, it was the cow that was going to
27822740	27823740	kill me.
27823740	27824740	It was a baby cow.
27826740	27828740	And you just log in right back after.
27830740	27831740	That's bizarre.
27831740	27832740	No, my...
27832740	27833740	What?
27834740	27836740	Well, it says we've been up for seven
27836740	27838740	hours or is it because I got logged out
27838740	27840740	when I went away for like a cup of tea
27840740	27841740	and that?
27841740	27842740	I wonder if that's why.
27843740	27844740	Hold on.
27845740	27846740	Is tuna max...
27846740	27848740	Is tuna max through there?
27850740	27851740	I've got Buddha at one point.
27851740	27853740	Yeah, you've just been DCing a lot.
27853740	27855740	Okay, every time I go for Tinkle Winkle,
27855740	27857740	I've been DCed so it doesn't count.
27858740	27859740	How much do you care about doing
27859740	27860740	the proper way?
27860740	27863740	I think I'm supposed to do wine next.
27863740	27864740	Someone says, hi, Emmy.
27864740	27866740	Is the Emmy imposter here?
27867740	27869740	Where's the Emmy imposter?
27873740	27874740	Oh, there it is.
27874740	27878740	You changed your name to Emmy Bizoon Game.
27878740	27879740	Level 113.
27879740	27881740	That's a big account, honestly.
27882740	27884740	Okay, let me grab this.
27887740	27888740	Emmy's...
27888740	27890740	Emmy's a RuneScape nerd.
27892740	27894740	No, it's not the real Emmers,
27894740	27895740	but someone likes her,
27895740	27898740	so I'm glad someone enjoys her as much to do that.
27899740	27901740	Emmy the Goal, honestly.
27901740	27902740	What's the fit on Emmy?
27902740	27904740	Oh, they changed her hair to look like
27904740	27906740	her pumpkins and everything.
27906740	27908740	And give her a skirt.
27908740	27910740	That's supposed to be her blue shorts.
27910740	27912740	Okay, okay, okay.
27913740	27915740	Let him get up, let him get up.
27915740	27916740	Where is that?
27917740	27919740	We're already level 35.
27920740	27922740	We should've came here, like, from the beginning.
27922740	27925740	We wouldn't even have had to do anything.
27927740	27930740	Yeah, and that baby cow has been caught in front of a king.
27932740	27934740	Hydration check.
27934740	27936740	I'm actually running out of water.
27939740	27941740	What's mercy, one hour?
27946740	27947740	Wah.
27948740	27950740	It gives me, like, relief drink and water
27950740	27951740	for a millisecond,
27951740	27954740	and then I feel the pain of talking again.
27955740	27957740	Let's do this raw trip.
27958740	27959740	Raw trip.
27960740	27961740	Oh, sorry.
27961740	27963740	I keep forgetting Mr. Tuna Man.
27963740	27964740	Sorry, guys.
27965740	27967740	I got, like, three space.
27970740	27972740	That tuna man going ham.
27972740	27974740	Oh my God, that's so much money.
27975740	27977740	Absolutely nothing.
27977740	27979740	And then the value on your side
27979740	27981740	is just, like, losing horrifically.
27985740	27987740	I can do one more inventory,
27987740	27989740	and then I have to do some rune crafting
27989740	27990740	for my clan skull.
27990740	27991740	Okay, thank you so much.
27991740	27992740	Excuse me, ma'am.
27992740	27995740	We had to level up to 20 fishing to start fishing here.
27995740	28000740	Yes, you have to go back to the Castello.
28000740	28001740	Good luck.
28001740	28002740	Thank you so much for the...
28002740	28004740	Thanks for all the fish.
28004740	28007740	I'm pretty sure that is the ending to a movie
28007740	28010740	that Bilbo was in that I haven't watched yet.
28012740	28013740	I can't remember.
28013740	28015740	But it goes thanks for all the fish.
28015740	28017740	Level 36.
28018740	28019740	Oh my God.
28019740	28022740	The tuna, literally a hundred of pop as well, is crazy.
28024740	28026740	He keeps in the bunny soup girl
28026740	28027740	turning into a guy.
28027740	28028740	Oh, never mind.
28030740	28032740	It's because they're dancing on each other.
28032740	28033740	Hitchhiker's guide.
28033740	28035740	Yes, I've not seen that.
28036740	28037740	Good Lord, you're still alive?
28037740	28039740	Yeah, we're tuna maxing.
28039740	28041740	We're currently level 36.
28042740	28044740	And cooking is that purple one right there.
28045740	28046740	Here.
28046740	28048740	We're level 36.
28048740	28050740	Apparently your egg steeper hour is like
28050740	28052740	freaking 56K with the tuna.
28052740	28054740	It's like going up like crazy.
28061740	28062740	So much tuna.
28064740	28065740	You know what's really nice?
28065740	28066740	Tuna, cucumber, meal.
28068740	28070740	Like uncrusted bread.
28070740	28071740	Oh, no, no, no.
28071740	28072740	It's delicious.
28079740	28081740	Can we cook raw salmon yet?
28081740	28082740	Let me check.
28082740	28084740	Use the salmon on the fire.
28085740	28087740	What's everyone's opinion on anchovy pizza?
28087740	28088740	Oh, I can cook salmon.
28088740	28089740	Okay.
28089740	28091740	I can pick up salmon now as well.
28091740	28092740	Right.
28092740	28094740	I'll pick up salmon and trout so I can just like do it all.
28095740	28098740	Level 50 is about 100K egg fee total.
28100740	28102740	What's my total egg fee?
28104740	28106740	I am one fourth of the way to level 50.
28106740	28109740	I'm not sure I can do it before Maryse goes online.
28110740	28112740	Oh, I'll be cutting it close, I think.
28113740	28114740	Oh, no, I can't.
28114740	28115740	I would have to be tuna maxing.
28115740	28118740	Unless the salmon does it, I'm not sure.
28119740	28121740	Unless the salmon does it.
28123740	28126740	And if I stop burning everything.
28128740	28130740	I'm scooping up all this trout.
28130740	28132740	I'm scooping it up.
28132740	28134740	My inventory is getting so full.
28136740	28138740	Someone's got a mini cliff.
28139740	28141740	No, but that is huge.
28143740	28146740	It's so fast with the salmon as well.
28148740	28151740	Oh, five more salmon and then level up again.
28153740	28155740	Oh, come on, you can do it.
28155740	28156740	Two more.
28156740	28157740	One more.
28158740	28159740	Yes!
28160740	28161740	30 freaking six.
28162740	28163740	37, sorry.
28163740	28164740	I know numbers sometimes.
28165740	28168740	Oh, we are tuna maxing.
28168740	28171740	We are fish maxing out the wazoo right now.
28173740	28174740	Stronny.
28174740	28175740	You can do it, Stronny.
28175740	28177740	Cook this, Galea's base starts late.
28177740	28179740	There's neither motor.
28180740	28181740	There's neither motor.
28181740	28182740	There's neither motor.
28182740	28184740	There's neither motor.
28185740	28188740	We're going to do it, we're going to do it.
28190740	28193740	Tuna is more XP than salmon.
28193740	28195740	Salmon's more XP than trout.
28196740	28199740	But unfortunately I'm still at the burning stage,
28199740	28202740	so I'm not maximising my inventory right now.
28204740	28207740	I don't think there's any other quests that give cooking XP
28207740	28209740	that I know of other than...
28209740	28211740	There's probably a ton of members' quests
28211740	28214740	that do have, like, cooking XP.
28216740	28219740	But as it stands right now,
28220740	28222740	we'll do full inventory of raw trout.
28224740	28227740	But once we start, once we stop burning,
28227740	28231740	then we can do, like, max inventory XP gains,
28231740	28234740	which is really handy down there.
28235740	28236740	Who took that little bit sound?
28236740	28238740	Who taking my trout?
28238740	28239740	You need my trout.
28241740	28243740	Salmon might honestly be better rates
28243740	28245740	when you factor in the burn rate.
28245740	28246740	Mmm.
28246740	28248740	It's possible.
28248740	28251740	Someone else here is, like, snatching up the salmon,
28251740	28252740	which is fine.
28252740	28254740	Honestly, it's not like the trout is, like,
28254740	28256740	bad or anything.
28257740	28259740	I know we'll make it to 40.
28259740	28261740	The question is how far in?
28263740	28265740	True mummy gamey here, honestly.
28265740	28267740	Click simulator.
28267740	28269740	But it's so good though!
28269740	28271740	Oh, like, RuneScape is so nostalgic.
28279740	28282740	Look, it's like, I love how the Rune plug-in,
28282740	28284740	or whatever it's called, RuneLight,
28284740	28286740	literally absolutely annihilating out here.
28287740	28292740	Salmon's success rate at 38 is 74%.
28292740	28295740	Mmm, that's not bad.
28295740	28297740	Everyone in four?
28300740	28301740	Everyone in four.
28301740	28303740	Okay, who has the XL spreadsheet?
28303740	28305740	An optimal fish cookin'.
28306740	28309740	The best member's quest for it is the family crest,
28309740	28311740	so you get gloves that would just burn it.
28311740	28314740	Oh, I've never done, I don't know what that is actually.
28316740	28318740	It sounds difficult though,
28318740	28321740	because for something to be such a good item,
28321740	28323740	I feel like they would have put it behind,
28323740	28325740	like, really difficult quests.
28326740	28328740	Oh, if I can pick up a few of these salmon,
28328740	28329740	I'll make the photos.
28332740	28334740	RuneLight is insane.
28334740	28336740	I can never play with a vanilla client again.
28338740	28339740	Get mugged.
28341740	28343740	I suppose if you want, like, super nostalgic,
28343740	28344740	just leave it as is.
28344740	28346740	Right, we'll do the trout first,
28346740	28348740	because I want, like, I don't want to
28348740	28350740	have higher rate of burning the salmon,
28350740	28352740	since it offers more.
28353740	28355740	Do you just stream forever, strong?
28355740	28357740	I just really enjoy streaming,
28357740	28359740	and I like hanging out with refunds,
28359740	28361740	especially on days where we get to play a multiplayer game,
28361740	28363740	where we get to be together.
28363740	28365740	I really like that.
28366740	28369740	I'm actually going off a bit earlier than expected.
28369740	28371740	When Mercy comes online in an hour,
28371740	28373740	I'm raiding into her.
28373740	28376740	And the only reason I'm not doing an endurance today,
28376740	28380740	hmm, is because my voice is very sore,
28380740	28382740	and I have an ASMR stream tomorrow,
28382740	28385740	so I'm gonna have to try and rest it a bit better
28385740	28389740	than usual, than the usual
28391740	28393740	when a game is this old.
28396740	28398740	Yes, if my voice wasn't sore,
28398740	28400740	I unironically just do 12 hours again.
28400740	28401740	I'm sorry.
28401740	28402740	I would. I said it.
28402740	28404740	I said what we're all thinking.
28404740	28405740	You all know what...
28405740	28407740	Oh no, I didn't cook those raw salmon.
28407740	28409740	Silly Billy.
28409740	28411740	Oh no, it's giving me the actual salmon.
28411740	28413740	Ah, oh well.
28413740	28415740	I'm not salmon maxing.
28415740	28417740	I'm not a real salmon max, so I can't believe it.
28417740	28420740	I'm sorry you had to all find out this way.
28420740	28422740	Let's do a try.
28423740	28424740	We're doing...
28424740	28425740	We're getting pretty good at try.
28425740	28427740	We're getting pretty good.
28427740	28429740	Over eight hours not endurance.
28429740	28430740	Come on now.
28430740	28432740	I don't know, I feel like...
28432740	28434740	You know when you have like a regular nine to five job?
28434740	28437740	Like, obviously I had quite a few.
28438740	28440740	And I just put it in perspective.
28440740	28442740	Like, I'm literally memeing about on a video game.
28442740	28446740	I get to like play and like have fun times with you.
28446740	28448740	And it just like...
28448740	28449740	Oh my god, wait.
28449740	28450740	Is this Trinna Man back?
28450740	28452740	Hold on, is Trinna Man back?
28452740	28454740	Trinna, I thought you had to go do some things
28454740	28456740	with your clan or something.
28456740	28458740	Oh my god, we're Trinna Maxing again.
28458740	28459740	Oh!
28459740	28460740	Half a million?
28460740	28461740	Are you sure?
28461740	28463740	I mean, I ain't gonna say no.
28463740	28465740	How are you all so rich?
28467740	28468740	Where are you...
28468740	28470740	What are you doing to make money in RuneScape?
28470740	28474740	What are the ways to buy some good fish with it?
28474740	28475740	Thank you, Reefling.
28475740	28477740	Oh my gosh, when the time comes.
28477740	28479740	Yes, when I don't burn stuff.
28479740	28480740	How...
28480740	28483740	I have three billion on an Iron Man account.
28483740	28485740	How do you make money in RuneScape?
28485740	28486740	Seriously?
28487740	28488740	Trinna Man!
28488740	28489740	How?
28492740	28493740	How do you make money on RuneScape?
28493740	28494740	I don't know how.
28494740	28497740	I'm gonna put this money in the bank so I'm not full.
28498740	28501740	The more you play, the higher stats you get raised.
28501740	28502740	Strawni get...
28502740	28505740	get hella high level so we can do raids.
28506740	28507740	Oh!
28507740	28509740	What's raiding?
28511740	28513740	Oh, you guys teach me how to raid.
28513740	28517740	International Bank of Strawni, honestly though.
28519740	28522740	Oh, I wanted to get a pet that looked like you guys as well.
28522740	28523740	That was another goal.
28523740	28524740	So 99...
28524740	28525740	Um...
28527740	28530740	99, um...
28530740	28531740	Cookin'.
28531740	28533740	And then I want to get a pet that looks like you guys.
28533740	28535740	But I don't know how the pets work.
28535740	28537740	Golly, double neck.
28537740	28538740	Okay.
28538740	28540740	I'm gonna go put this in the bank.
28540740	28541740	No, VC.
28542740	28544740	Math wants to choose.
28544740	28546740	Math, I don't have much inventory.
28546740	28547740	I'm sorry.
28548740	28551740	Oh yeah, give me them...
28551740	28552740	Sardines?
28552740	28553740	You giving me...
28553740	28554740	Oh!
28554740	28557740	Oh yeah, we got pike ladies and gentlemen.
28557740	28558740	Get that cooked.
28558740	28560740	Get that cooked on that fire thing.
28560740	28561740	Thank you.
28561740	28562740	Get that cooked.
28563740	28565740	Oh, it made me 39!
28565740	28567740	Economic Dragon Bitter.
28569740	28572740	Not to be confused with the German word bitter,
28572740	28575740	which means please, I think.
28575740	28577740	Bitter?
28577740	28578740	No.
28578740	28581740	I don't think that's what that means in German.
28582740	28583740	Hee-hee-hee.
28583740	28585740	Also high level drops peaking.
28585740	28586740	No, I couldn't do peaking.
28586740	28587740	Oh, I'm coming back.
28587740	28589740	Don't worry, Reeflings, I'm coming back.
28589740	28591740	Mummy's putting the money in the bank.
28591740	28592740	I'm coming back, okay?
28592740	28595740	Mummy needs to pay rent, so I'm putting it in the bank.
28595740	28598740	We need to rent that location out for only us.
28598740	28600740	Bitter means please, okay?
28600740	28602740	No, Reeflings, don't cry, I'm coming back.
28602740	28604740	Sorry, I forgot to say that, I needed to go.
28604740	28606740	I'm putting this in the bank, okay?
28606740	28607740	Look, bank.
28608740	28609740	And look at that.
28609740	28610740	We're max.
28610740	28612740	Look how much fish we've got.
28612740	28614740	200 raw ship.
28614740	28617740	600 salmon.
28617740	28619740	450 swordfish.
28619740	28621740	500 lobster's raw tuna.
28621740	28622740	Like, there's so much.
28622740	28624740	I don't want to burn any of this, though.
28625740	28627740	Bitter means you are welcome.
28627740	28628740	Oh, Dankeschon.
28628740	28629740	Bitter.
28629740	28630740	Okay, there we go.
28630740	28632740	There's a sentence that you could use in.
28632740	28634740	Oh, no, Dankeschon?
28634740	28636740	Or Dankeschon?
28636740	28638740	No, I think it has a kh.
28639740	28641740	Don't worry, Reeflings, I'm coming back.
28641740	28643740	Look, see, I'm coming, I'm coming.
28643740	28645740	Look, look, look, you're gonna render again.
28645740	28646740	Yay, Reeflings!
28646740	28648740	All the Reeflings are here.
28649740	28651740	You've got money to burn all that fish.
28651740	28653740	You're loaded, holy.
28653740	28655740	Literally, a Reefling gave me 10 million.
28655740	28656740	Another gave me a million.
28656740	28658740	One just gave me half a million there.
28658740	28660740	But I don't want to waste it.
28660740	28662740	I don't want to waste the money.
28664740	28667740	Oh, sorry, sorry, I accept.
28667740	28669740	Sorry, I'm fish-maxing, okay?
28669740	28670740	Where's Mommy?
28670740	28672740	Mommy's back, Mommy's back.
28674740	28676740	How much XP do you get for this?
28676740	28678740	I didn't even know you could fish it here.
28680740	28682740	Can't believe someone went...
28683740	28684740	What?
28684740	28686740	I can't believe someone went more dry
28686740	28688740	than I did on a dragonfish.
28689740	28690740	How much did we get?
28690740	28692740	Oh, we got A.A. for these?
28692740	28694740	These are the same as mine?
28695740	28697740	We cease to exist when you leave us.
28697740	28699740	No!
28699740	28700740	Reeflings!
28700740	28702740	Bitter means a bunch of things, including both.
28702740	28703740	Okay.
28705740	28707740	My German knowledge is expanding.
28709740	28711740	I know to expand
28712740	28714740	my Puerto Rican knowledge.
28715740	28717740	That's all you get.
28717740	28718740	Okay.
28723740	28725740	I don't know how many pets I got.
28725740	28727740	Can you own all the pets that won?
28728740	28730740	Oh, they're like little symbols to show what won.
28730740	28732740	There's 24 pets!
28734740	28735740	What?
28735740	28736740	How?
28740740	28741740	How's there 24?
28741740	28743740	There are 59 pets?
28744740	28745740	What?
28746740	28748740	That's a lot.
28749740	28751740	Yeah, especially now because I have a
28751740	28753740	chain made in a void worker jam.
28753740	28755740	Is that how you attract pets to you?
28755740	28756740	You wear jewelry?
28757740	28758740	They're like, ooh, shiny.
28758740	28760740	Is there a magpie pet?
28763740	28765740	What have we got?
28765740	28767740	Oh, actually, I've picked the place clean.
28767740	28769740	That's how much I'm fish-maxing.
28769740	28770740	There's nothing on the ground.
28770740	28771740	I've picked it clean.
28771740	28772740	Oh, wait.
28772740	28773740	There's a trade.
28773740	28774740	Ah!
28774740	28775740	I'm missing.
28776740	28777740	A rubbish aimbot.
28777740	28778740	Whoa, yeah.
28778740	28779740	17.
28779740	28780740	39.
28781740	28782740	All salmon.
28782740	28784740	We're all in on salmon.
28784740	28786740	Salmon cook and run.
28786740	28788740	We're almost level 40.
28788740	28790740	40's like a melody and...
28791740	28792740	Oh, sorry.
28792740	28793740	I just punched them.
28793740	28794740	I can hear that.
28794740	28796740	There's a little anime there.
28798740	28799740	Stronti only just starts streaming.
28799740	28801740	She's already a 1% earner in this game.
28801740	28802740	Wait, really?
28802740	28805740	Is level 40 a 1% thing?
28805740	28808740	Like, hardly anyone gets to 40 in something?
28810740	28812740	Shorty's like a melody and...
28813740	28814740	I can't keep growl.
28814740	28815740	Got me singing like...
28816740	28817740	Na na na na na.
28817740	28818740	Every day.
28818740	28819740	Like my eyes.
28819740	28821740	Is it like my eyeballs stuck on the plate?
28825740	28826740	Those bars were good.
28826740	28828740	She punched the refline.
28828740	28829740	I'm sorry.
28832740	28833740	There's a fishing pit,
28833740	28835740	but you have to be on a member's role to get it,
28835740	28837740	and scaling pits are especially good.
28838740	28840740	He means the money to do some...
28842740	28843740	We hit 40!
28843740	28844740	We hit 40!
28847740	28848740	Actually so good.
28849740	28852740	I might make one last cup of tea.
28852740	28853740	We need a lock-in.
28853740	28855740	We need a lock-in, okay.
28856740	28857740	Lobster time.
28857740	28859740	Oh no, I'm not gonna waste a lobster.
28859740	28860740	That's crazy.
28861740	28863740	I'm not gonna waste the lobsters.
28863740	28864740	Oh!
28864740	28866740	I mean, unless you give me lobsters,
28866740	28867740	that's different.
28867740	28869740	If you give me lobsters to waste,
28869740	28870740	that's different.
28870740	28873740	I'm not sure what my fricking rate is gonna be.
28874740	28875740	Burn them all.
28875740	28877740	Oh, I kicked my first one correctly!
28879740	28880740	Wah!
28880740	28882740	120?
28883740	28884740	Oh no!
28885740	28886740	They're getting burned.
28886740	28887740	I know you can't see them over my...
28887740	28888740	My heart.
28889740	28892740	Can I move myself over just a tiny bit more?
28895740	28896740	I don't want it.
28896740	28897740	Actually, yeah.
28897740	28898740	Yeah?
28899740	28900740	Okay, yeah, that's better.
28900740	28902740	You can, like, really see the inventory and stuff.
28903740	28904740	Learning.
28904740	28905740	We're gonna keep learning.
28907740	28910740	If all the boys get 40 fishing,
28910740	28913740	must the point will be for pure lobsters.
28914740	28915740	Wait, you wanna do lobsters?
28915740	28917740	Wait, you guys stay up all night
28917740	28919740	just so you can get 40 fishing?
28919740	28921740	So we can do lobster runs?
28921740	28923740	120 is a lot.
28923740	28925740	Look at the success rate, though.
28925740	28926740	What does it say?
28926740	28928740	Oh, the success rate is going up.
28928740	28929740	It's 20%.
28931740	28932740	What's that?
28932740	28933740	Oh, that's mine.
28933740	28934740	That's mine.
28938740	28939740	Oh, rest well, those two sleep.
28939740	28941740	I'm sorry, I streamed so long.
28942740	28944740	For those of you who do need to leave,
28944740	28945740	please don't worry.
28945740	28946740	I'm literally doing this until the end.
28946740	28947740	We're gonna read it in a mercy,
28947740	28949740	because my poor voice is feeling it, Mr. Prev.
28949740	28951740	There's no way you already have
28951740	28954740	more freaking lobsters for me or something.
28954740	28955740	Oh, okay, okay.
28955740	28956740	We go pick, go pick.
28956740	28957740	This is crazy.
28959740	28961740	This is crazy.
28961740	28963740	Can you get in trouble by Jagex
28963740	28964740	for doing this?
28965740	28967740	I can stay until 40, fish up or lobsters.
28967740	28969740	No, that's crazy.
28969740	28971740	I'm at 31 fishing at the moment.
28972740	28975740	I got distracted watching you
28975740	28977740	forgot to go back more.
28978740	28980740	Goodnight, sleepers, rest well.
28980740	28982740	Never can see how much seafood you are wasting.
28982740	28983740	No!
28985740	28987740	I just meant for the lobsters.
28987740	28988740	That one.
28988740	28989740	Long streams are good,
28989740	28991740	because I can catch them when I wake up.
28991740	28995740	I will sleep when I'm beat
28995740	28998740	by drowning by more domination of the cheese.
28999740	29001740	Oh, my God, we're almost 41.
29001740	29002740	Oh, freaking crazy.
29002740	29004740	We just wear a 40.
29004740	29006740	Sleep is a construct.
29006740	29008740	Construct is a government I've never given.
29009740	29011740	Oh, my gosh.
29013740	29014740	Can we do it?
29014740	29016740	Can we make it 41 already?
29018740	29019740	One more?
29019740	29020740	Don't burn them.
29020740	29022740	No, don't burn them.
29022740	29023740	I should burn it.
29023740	29027740	40 freaking one.
29027740	29028740	No!
29029740	29031740	This is so good.
29033740	29034740	Oh, my God.
29034740	29036740	You're already trading with me.
29039740	29042740	I hope I can't get in trouble by jargates from this.
29043740	29045740	Stuff like this can run the game for new players,
29045740	29047740	so be careful about donations for new players long term.
29049740	29050740	I have played,
29050740	29052740	I do have a basic concept of the game,
29052740	29054740	but if you're going to ask me to do
29054740	29056740	dungeoning and stuff,
29056740	29058740	I could not tell you where the gargoyles are,
29058740	29060740	but apparently gargoyles.
29060740	29062740	Hey, Strony, how do you get a fishing rod?
29062740	29064740	I've never tried this before.
29064740	29066740	Aw, you tiny culls.
29067740	29069740	You would have to level up
29069740	29072740	with that fishing net you got from Tutorial Island,
29072740	29074740	but you can't use it here.
29074740	29076740	You would have to go back to Lumbridge.
29076740	29078740	This is Lumbridge, where you came from.
29078740	29080740	You can use the magic spell to teleport,
29080740	29084740	and you have to do net fishing here until 20.
29084740	29087740	And then you can come here for a fly fishing.
29088740	29090740	I'm so sorry, Little Reefling.
29090740	29092740	There are gates to level up on fishing.
29092740	29094740	They're probably a lot better than my method,
29094740	29096740	but that's why I've always used it with the kids.
29096740	29099740	Gargoyles are decent money for mid players,
29099740	29102740	but 75 slayers is probably the slowest of them even.
29103740	29106740	That burn rate is looking a bit rough on the lobster,
29106740	29108740	so I'm not going to lie.
29108740	29109740	Anyone got some feathers on them?
29109740	29111740	So, well, I guess that's all great.
29111740	29113740	Aw, thank you, Little Reefling.
29115740	29117740	That burn rate is looking rough.
29119740	29120740	Oh, my God, what should I do?
29120740	29121740	I feel about it.
29123740	29125740	How expensive are the lobsters?
29125740	29127740	I feel like they're probably breaking through.
29129740	29130740	We're burnt through the fish already.
29130740	29131740	No, we're not.
29131740	29132740	I tell a lie.
29132740	29133740	Let's forget.
29133740	29136740	Who are you coming so fast?
29138740	29139740	You just handed me them.
29139740	29141740	Is there a bank nearby?
29142740	29144740	I thought the bank was over there.
29144740	29145740	Am I going crazy?
29145740	29146740	Is there a bank up there?
29147740	29148740	He's just disappeared again.
29148740	29150740	Is there a bank up there?
29151740	29153740	Ageville has a bank.
29153740	29154740	Oh, I'll make sure you...
29155740	29156740	Call meville,
29156740	29158740	because, I don't know, there's something.
29159740	29161740	If I could trade.
29161740	29162740	I'm so sorry.
29162740	29163740	Wait, I'll trade.
29163740	29164740	I'm sorry.
29164740	29165740	I'll trade.
29167740	29168740	Okay, I'll trade.
29168740	29169740	I'll trade.
29169740	29170740	I'll trade.
29170740	29171740	I'll trade.
29174740	29175740	Bro's hacking.
29176740	29178740	Can you even hack in RuneScape?
29178740	29180740	That sounds like it's nice and possible,
29180740	29181740	because of the way the server is.
29181740	29183740	Call meville, because I'm edging.
29183740	29184740	Yes!
29184740	29185740	Call meville, because I'm edging.
29189740	29190740	I came up with that myself.
29190740	29191740	I did.
29191740	29192740	I did.
29192740	29193740	It's true.
29193740	29195740	You could start using a range closer
29195740	29197740	to the bank rather than the fire rate,
29197740	29199740	since you don't fish in anymore.
29199740	29200740	Probably.
29201740	29202740	That's very true.
29208740	29211740	Oh, that burn rate is rough on those lobbies.
29212740	29214740	Every lobster that we burn is a missing,
29214740	29216740	like, 120, which is, like,
29216740	29217740	so frigging thingy.
29217740	29218740	I lied.
29218740	29219740	I made it.
29219740	29221740	Wait, there's another refling.
29221740	29222740	There's the strategy.
29222740	29223740	Hold on.
29225740	29227740	Wait, you've got lobster runs as well?
29228740	29229740	Whoa!
29230740	29232740	Isn't this not, like, thousands,
29232740	29234740	like, thousands of gold?
29234740	29235740	Am I not going mental?
29235740	29236740	I feel like this is, like, thousands.
29236740	29237740	Go ahead and run.
29237740	29239740	Energy needs to recharge.
29241740	29242740	Whoa, we got a full shoot.
29243740	29244740	Five in a row.
29245740	29246740	42!
29250740	29252740	It depends on how fast you want to get this level,
29252740	29254740	but Bar Village is more...
29255740	29256740	The most...
29256740	29258740	The most cooking ranges.
29263740	29265740	You can make a million per hour?
29267740	29269740	A million XP per hour?
29269740	29270740	Strony, even if it says
29270740	29272740	and you've already been given millions?
29272740	29273740	Honestly.
29273740	29275740	If you take the exclamation mark,
29275740	29276740	praise?
29276740	29277740	What?
29280740	29281740	Stop!
29281740	29282740	Did you make me...
29282740	29284740	Did you just make me fall for something obvious?
29285740	29286740	I don't know.
29298740	29300740	Yeah, I spent 160 on 2k.
29300740	29301740	That's, like, two voxels.
29303740	29304740	You have to take that.
29304740	29305740	I'm afterward.
29308740	29309740	Oh, knee drop, knee drop.
29309740	29311740	Oh, yeah, that was a much better lobster
29311740	29313740	cooking batch than the previous one,
29313740	29315740	the other one that I absolutely cooked with them.
29319740	29320740	Ooh, fishy.
29322740	29324740	Oh, right, okay, take that.
29325740	29326740	Let's try and do this.
29327740	29328740	Exclamation mark, praise?
29328740	29330740	Let it all be set to error.
29334740	29335740	Oh!
29335740	29336740	It worked!
29337740	29339740	Oh, there are 150 a pack?
29339740	29340740	Ooh.
29341740	29344740	If I buy feathers from people we drop on?
29344740	29345740	Okay, 300k.
29345740	29346740	Oh, great.
29347740	29349740	Right, don't buy any more fish,
29349740	29351740	cos it's literally I've got
29351740	29354740	less than 50 minutes now.
29354740	29357740	I'm gonna go quickly grab a bottle of water.
29358740	29359740	Cos I'm so thirsty.
29359740	29360740	I don't need to,
29360740	29361740	I don't need to,
29361740	29362740	I don't need to,
29362740	29363740	I don't need to,
29363740	29364740	I don't need to,
29364740	29365740	I don't need to,
29365740	29366740	I don't need to.
29366740	29367740	Ooh.
29386740	29387740	Wow!
29388740	29389740	Ooh, ooh, I hear burning noises.
29389740	29390740	I hear burning noises.
29391740	29392740	Cos we're burning deficies.
29393740	29395740	Right, I've got a new bowl of water.
29396740	29399540	I'm so hydrated, but I don't want to pee, I want to fish max.
29399540	29401820	I need to fish max, you don't understand.
29401820	29403940	I'm fish maxing, you wouldn't get it.
29405900	29407700	I have lobby maxing, you wouldn't get it.
29407700	29409380	You wouldn't understand, Mum.
29409380	29410620	Mum, I need membership.
29416100	29418460	I'll give it a try, I'll be back in a minute.
29418460	29419300	Go for it.
29420460	29422140	I've only been listening to ASMR for about a minute,
29422140	29423580	so I'm excited for starting ASMR.
29425020	29426180	I definitely am not the best.
29426180	29430380	I would say like, Mercy and Icy are like super professional.
29430380	29431740	Super idol.
29432740	29434780	43!
29434780	29436380	And we've had a lot of two-stacked...
29436380	29437980	Oh, I was about to say, we've got two-stacked
29437980	29440020	for all of the lobbies not being burnt.
29441260	29442420	Spoke too soon there.
29446500	29447620	Hydration check.
29449940	29450940	Wow.
29451940	29458740	You know, as much as the chef hat and the apron are made out of gold,
29458740	29460940	I don't think it's actually making me a better chef.
29465540	29467740	How much longer before you have to leave?
29467740	29468780	Is there a exact time?
29468780	29471060	Mercy is coming on in 45 minutes.
29471060	29474380	I'm going to redirect into her because I need to do vocal rest
29474380	29476500	before the ASMR stream tomorrow.
29476500	29478900	And it hurts to talk right now, which is a shame.
29478900	29480820	It's literally the only reason I'm going offline.
29480820	29483620	I probably didn't during the stream every single day if I killed it, honestly.
29485420	29490420	But my voice is sore and I need to be quiet for the ASMR.
29490420	29492220	Tomorrow's going to be a short...
29492220	29495020	No, you guys are so quick on it.
29496420	29497620	This is crazy.
29498420	29499300	It doesn't make sense.
29499300	29501220	They're gold, literally.
29502420	29503780	Drink some nice hot tea.
29503780	29505940	Yes, I've had too much tea today.
29505940	29507740	Because I put honey in my tea,
29507740	29511340	it gets, like, sickly if I have too much of it,
29511340	29513700	so I have to swap to water only.
29514900	29516980	What's your target that you're going for this stream?
29516980	29521900	I wanted to get 50, but I don't think it's possible because of time.
29521900	29526260	I didn't realise how fast cooking the fish was going to be
29526260	29528020	if I wasn't, like, doing those quests.
29528020	29532300	But I had fun doing quests for the reason, so actually, I don't really regret it at all.
29532300	29533980	I'll be cutting it close.
29533980	29537660	Like, if we're literally, like, a couple of minutes away, then I'll do it.
29537700	29540100	But, unfortunately, my voice is, like...
29540100	29541100	Yeah.
29541100	29544580	And most of all, I felt that one literally...
29545580	29547020	I do look stylish, though.
29547020	29547940	I mean, look at that.
29547940	29549860	Something a little cosy.
29552180	29554380	Look at the detail in my eyes and everything.
29554380	29557180	The polys are the favourites all the time.
29558700	29559660	Honey in tea is good.
29559660	29561700	Maybe I'll add less honey.
29561700	29562220	I don't know.
29562220	29564860	I feel, like, sickly if I...
29564860	29566060	I don't know, I just can't.
29566060	29567460	It's just not working.
29568660	29570340	It's just not working.
29571820	29575460	I know you can have those throat sweets,
29575460	29580780	but I don't know if they actually do anything or just, like, make my teeth feel a little sugary.
29580780	29582540	It's, like, my biggest frickin' thing.
29582540	29583180	Wait, hold on.
29583180	29584420	Am I taking this?
29584420	29586580	I can't remember who I keep taking off of.
29587580	29592540	I'm sorry for whoever the other lobster runners, like, I can't remember between...
29593740	29595900	200k feathers under me.
29595900	29596420	Damn.
29597420	29597940	Damn.
29599780	29601620	Damn, you're in a wedding dress and everything.
29601620	29602420	What the heck?
29603220	29605220	All of your black hair, this is cute.
29605220	29606580	And your little cape.
29606580	29608220	Oh, I forgot to get us green capes.
29608220	29608980	Oops.
29608980	29609820	We'll do the next thing.
29611140	29612740	Can you say throat sweets again?
29612740	29613420	Yeah, throat sweets.
29614540	29617180	They, like, help with your throat when you feel sick or whatever.
29617180	29619020	Or if you've got strain, I guess.
29621380	29622300	Are you still streaming?
29622300	29625820	Yeah, um, we've got roughly 40 minutes.
29625860	29627140	And then it's Mercy's time.
29627140	29628660	We're gonna redirect into Mercy.
29630380	29631980	Bon bon.
29638620	29642140	Oh, I'm making an absolute mockery of this one.
29642140	29643540	I don't think I'm gonna burn it, alright.
29643540	29644100	Yeah.
29644860	29646740	Oh, we're close to the 44, though.
29650780	29651540	Bicola.
29653340	29654340	Wait, Bicola?
29656820	29657820	Wait, what's Bicola?
29659820	29661820	I can hear that, Bicola.
29661820	29662820	What's that mean, chan?
29662820	29663820	Huh?
29663820	29664820	Eto?
29664820	29665820	What's that?
29665820	29666820	Bicola.
29671820	29674820	A tape of throat lozenger.
29674820	29675820	Oh, it's a cough drug.
29675820	29677820	Bicola is a brand of lozenger.
29677820	29678820	Oh, okay, okay.
29678820	29679820	Oh, sorry.
29680820	29681820	Wah.
29681820	29682820	Here you go.
29682820	29683820	Here you go.
29685820	29686820	Lobster runner.
29686820	29687820	I can't believe it.
29687820	29689820	Might as well do 99 room crafting while we're at it.
29689820	29691820	You guys will make it super easy.
29694820	29697820	It's the comical jingle that was very common.
29697820	29699820	Oh, it's a commercial jingle.
29699820	29700820	Sorry.
29701820	29703820	Ah, I see, I see, I see.
29704820	29705820	But not I see smokers.
29705820	29706820	But I see.
29709820	29710820	There's a new...
29712820	29714820	New room craft minigame, and it's fun.
29715820	29717820	Anyone else able to see the feathers yet?
29717820	29720820	No, you might have to pick them up in case it's too much when you defawn.
29722820	29724820	No feathers.
29727820	29729820	Yeah, hopefully they don't defawn,
29729820	29731820	because 20k feathers isn't cheap.
29735820	29737820	Did you time the six feathers?
29737820	29738820	Johnny's so cool and got excited.
29738820	29739820	This is Coca-Cola.
29739820	29740820	It's so much.
29742820	29743820	How long does it take after doffin'?
29743820	29745820	I thought it was 60 seconds.
29746820	29749820	If it's been 60 seconds, I would just scoop them back up again,
29749820	29750820	because I would hate them to...
29750820	29752820	No, not the headbinds!
29757820	29758820	What a book.
29758820	29759820	Wah.
29760820	29762820	Level 40 fricking four.
29763820	29766820	If I could stop fricking burning them lobsters,
29766820	29767820	they'll...
29767820	29768820	Wah.
29768820	29770820	They'll accept trade, accept trade.
29778820	29779820	We're getting there though.
29780820	29782820	Do you have less burn chance on a...
29782820	29784820	a grill thing?
29784820	29785820	An oven?
29785820	29787820	A grill thing.
29788820	29790820	30 seconds to appear to others,
29790820	29792820	three minutes to despawn.
29792820	29793820	We're learning.
29793820	29795820	We're learning the ways a burn stage is done.
29801820	29804820	No only in whose side it is.
29806820	29807820	Wah.
29807820	29810820	Range and fire are the same kissing chance, mostly.
29810820	29811820	Okay, there's no point.
29811820	29815820	I was like, maybe we should move this production line,
29815820	29816820	but...
29816820	29818820	I think the rooflings are just fishing away.
29818820	29820820	They're just having a good time.
29822820	29825820	We definitely need to level ourselves up,
29825820	29828820	because we're the target for a lot of NPCs
29828820	29831820	when we're trying to travel through areas.
29836820	29837820	The stream's ending in 40 minutes.
29837820	29839820	Does that mean brush teeth intend?
29839820	29840820	Yes!
29840820	29841820	We have to brush our teeth.
29843820	29845820	Okay, thank goodness I didn't make another teeth,
29845820	29847820	because I wouldn't have been able to brush my teeth.
29849820	29850820	If you're having...
29850820	29852820	If you want to brush your teeth with us
29853820	29855820	for your enameled...
29855820	29858820	Don't eat or drink fizzy juice.
29859820	29861820	You can have water for the next 30 minutes,
29861820	29864820	but you're not to brush your teeth if you've eaten
29864820	29866820	after 30 minutes,
29866820	29868820	because it hurts your enamel
29868820	29870820	rather than helping it.
29870820	29872820	I think that's my only note
29872820	29874820	if you want to brush your teeth with us.
29875820	29876820	Not so fun story.
29876820	29878820	My brother once choked on one
29878820	29880820	of those throat sweeps
29880820	29882820	and helped with the throat throat.
29883820	29885820	Ooh, that's terrifying.
29886820	29888820	45?
29889820	29890820	45?
29890820	29891820	45?
29891820	29893820	We're at 61 8 feet.
29893820	29894820	Oh, goodness.
29894820	29895820	We may actually make the 50.
29895820	29896820	You know that.
29899820	29901820	Ah, my throat farted when I swallowed it.
29901820	29902820	Did you hear that?
29902820	29904820	That was like an internal throat fart.
29911820	29913820	I said that!
29917820	29918820	1 in 3.
29919820	29920820	Oh, baby.
29923820	29926820	He learned so much from this educational
29926820	29928820	and professional streamer.
29928820	29930820	That takes me back to the toothbrush
29930820	29931820	somewhere.
29938820	29940820	We are so going to get 50
29940820	29942820	before Mercy comes on and makes me funny.
29942820	29944820	Oh, Mercy's actually...
29944820	29946820	I think she's decorating alternative
29946820	29948820	outfits for us.
29948820	29949820	So...
29949820	29951820	We are in...
29952820	29954820	Have our lobster reserves ran dry.
29954820	29956820	Have I perished all the lobsters
29956820	29958820	for sale in the Grand Exchange?
29959820	29960820	Oh, unless.
29960820	29961820	Unless.
29961820	29962820	Unless.
29964820	29967820	You guys are sweating to get me to level 99.
29967820	29968820	You're actually so kind.
29968820	29970820	I just want to say a special thank you
29970820	29971820	for those of you who are like
29971820	29973820	unironically feeding me.
29973820	29974820	This is going to make the school
29974820	29976820	way faster doing this.
29977820	29978820	Hmm.
29985820	29987820	You'd say that Stronny's a really good drop.
29987820	29988820	What?
29989820	29991820	Do you think she'd make you one of those?
29991820	29992820	What?
29993820	29994820	What is going on?
29995820	29997820	No stops on this lobster train.
29997820	29998820	Literally.
30002820	30004820	I know the fishing spot.
30007820	30009820	Nearly one million XP an hour.
30009820	30010820	Stop.
30010820	30011820	Is that it?
30011820	30012820	Unlucky.
30013820	30014820	I love stories.
30015820	30017820	I suppose if I didn't burn them,
30017820	30018820	that's very plausible.
30018820	30020820	Every stack is like...
30021820	30023820	What, 26 inventory?
30024820	30025820	Like...
30027820	30029820	I think five tables are shooting it.
30029820	30030820	I don't know.
30030820	30032820	With some tick manipulation.
30032820	30034820	I don't know what the tick rate manipulation
30034820	30035820	stuff means.
30035820	30037820	I hear it all the time though.
30038820	30039820	It's like, oh you just got to make sure
30039820	30040820	you do this on the tick
30040820	30041820	and you have to eat.
30041820	30042820	You have to eat the food on the tick.
30042820	30044820	Oh, can I swap out prayer?
30044820	30045820	I need a prayer flick.
30045820	30046820	I need a prayer flick.
30046820	30048820	Like, I'm like, what does any of this mean?
30051820	30052820	You're crazy.
30052820	30053820	Crazy.
30055820	30057820	Also, for those of you using runelight,
30057820	30060820	if you don't want an item name to show up,
30061820	30062820	can hold,
30063820	30064820	alt,
30064820	30065820	and write...
30066820	30067820	the irons here.
30068820	30070820	We're getting the real stress here.
30073820	30076820	Being an apron has always been a dream of mine.
30077820	30081820	The game runs on 0.62nd increments called ticks.
30081820	30082820	That's it.
30082820	30083820	Oh!
30085820	30086820	That basic...
30086820	30089820	Okay, that just like explains everything.
30091820	30092820	That's it.
30092820	30093820	That's all it took.
30093820	30095820	One sentence and it all makes sense.
30095820	30097820	Okay, because I was like,
30097820	30099820	prayer, I need prayer flick on this tick.
30099820	30101820	Like, over prayer flick.
30101820	30102820	I'm like, what?
30102820	30104820	I'm not, I'm even sure that's supposed to be
30104820	30105820	having the games played.
30105820	30106820	I don't know.
30106820	30107820	Did the devs intend that?
30107820	30108820	But they never patched it out.
30108820	30109820	So I guess prayer
30109820	30111820	flicking is the right way to go.
30112820	30114820	Because prayer drains so fast.
30115820	30120820	I'm getting new brain cells just from streaming.
30122820	30123820	Level 47?
30124820	30125820	No.
30126820	30127820	Oh wait, sorry, 46.
30128820	30129820	Two more.
30129820	30130820	If I don't burn these.
30130820	30131820	If I don't burn this one.
30133820	30134820	46.
30135820	30136820	Oh my gosh.
30138820	30139820	We're so MLG pro.
30141820	30142820	Look at me, bro.
30143820	30144820	Look at me, bro.
30144820	30145820	MLG pro.
30147820	30148820	Let me see.
30148820	30149820	Oh my god, my tummy's rumbling.
30149820	30150820	You could hear that over the background.
30151820	30152820	Wow.
30154820	30155820	I'm literally slid.
30157820	30158820	It's not intended,
30158820	30160820	but Jagex just accepted.
30160820	30161820	I was going to say,
30161820	30162820	if they didn't,
30162820	30164820	whenever like something gets discovered,
30164820	30167820	like, so this is for the overwatch players,
30167820	30169820	but Mercy had a guardian angel leap.
30170820	30173820	And it got discovered
30173820	30175820	and it was never patched out the game,
30175820	30176820	which meant it was intended,
30176820	30178820	even though it was never described.
30179820	30180820	So that's how I take it.
30180820	30182820	If the devs don't patch it out,
30182820	30184820	it's allowed, basically.
30185820	30187820	Once you get to level 92,
30187820	30188820	you're halfway there.
30188820	30189820	Yay.
30190820	30191820	Anyway, congrats, dumb dumb.
30191820	30193820	This was the stream I was looking forward.
30193820	30194820	The less,
30194820	30196820	but ended up probably being one of the funniest,
30196820	30197820	really?
30198820	30199820	It's just me receiving,
30199820	30202820	like, tons of in-game currency for doing nothing.
30205820	30206820	But please don't worry,
30206820	30207820	if you're interested in more,
30207820	30208820	like, multiplayer games
30208820	30210820	where we can play together,
30210820	30211820	I definitely am doing,
30211820	30214820	like, a whole variety of things going on.
30220820	30221820	I would definitely, like,
30221820	30222820	other ones, like...
30225820	30226820	No, that's not what's official name.
30226820	30227820	What's the name of the game?
30228820	30229820	Fall Guys.
30230820	30232820	I wanted to give Fortnite a chance.
30232820	30234820	Apparently, Fortnite
30234820	30236820	has added, like, different game modes.
30238820	30241820	Call of Duty has apparently introduced prop one.
30241820	30242820	I don't know if we could...
30242820	30243820	Oh, there's a captain.
30243820	30246820	Do we do the captain mini-quest?
30247820	30250820	I don't know if we do the captain one.
30251820	30254820	At the Fortnite metal path.
30255820	30258820	I just shit out my hands.
30258820	30259820	It's...
30259820	30261820	Is it bad?
30262820	30264820	Is it a bad quest?
30264820	30265820	Is it the captain,
30265820	30267820	or is it a good one?
30267820	30268820	It's quick.
30268820	30270820	Okay, if it's quick, let's try it.
30270820	30272820	Problem is, these old-time...
30272820	30275820	Uh, sure, I'll help you unlock your chest.
30275820	30277820	There are three columns.
30277820	30278820	What you need to do is match up
30278820	30280820	each picture on the column.
30281820	30282820	A bar,
30283820	30284820	a ring,
30284820	30285820	and a bowl.
30289820	30291820	Oh, got a wee golden ring!
30292820	30293820	Um...
30294820	30295820	What'd I do with it?
30295820	30296820	I already have a diamond ring on
30296820	30297820	from a wreathling,
30297820	30298820	so I can't take it off.
30301820	30302820	Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.
30302820	30303820	I completely forgot
30303820	30305820	we're trying to lobster max right now.
30305820	30306820	Oops.
30307820	30308820	One less space,
30308820	30309820	one less space,
30309820	30311820	because I'll drop the golden ring.
30316820	30317820	Oh, I could have gave you
30317820	30318820	the golden ring, actually,
30318820	30321820	because lobsters trading there.
30321820	30323820	The ring's your problem now.
30326820	30328820	Captain is the worst random?
30328820	30329820	No.
30330820	30331820	The sign which lady is,
30331820	30333820	she never gives you anything good.
30335820	30336820	Hail divers,
30336820	30337820	mollo player.
30337820	30338820	Is that easy to say at all?
30345820	30346820	Well, sign which lady
30346820	30348820	and quiz master already.
30349820	30350820	Quiz master's rubbish,
30350820	30352820	I don't like that one.
30354820	30355820	Uh, for...
30355820	30357820	Stroudy, please don't play Fortnite.
30357820	30358820	Oh no, what's wrong?
30360820	30361820	It's bad game.
30361820	30362820	It's bad game.
30365820	30366820	Get that steal,
30366820	30367820	but yeah,
30367820	30368820	I think it's kind of drop in,
30368820	30369820	drop out.
30370820	30371820	Um,
30371820	30373820	I would like to play among us
30373820	30374820	so I can start screaming at you,
30374820	30375820	and I'll be like,
30375820	30376820	it's red, it's red,
30376820	30377820	wreathlings,
30377820	30378820	you don't believe me,
30378820	30379820	it's red.
30382820	30383820	But we'll have to,
30383820	30385820	we'll have to try it
30385820	30386820	and see what happens.
30391820	30392820	Okay, I'm done.
30393820	30394820	I'm so, I'm so emoji.
30394820	30395820	Look at me like,
30395820	30396820	I'm literally hovering
30396820	30397820	ready for the trade offer.
30397820	30398820	Like, yeah, yeah,
30398820	30399820	give me the trade offer.
30399820	30400820	Oh, look, your problem now.
30400820	30401820	There you go.
30401820	30402820	Oh, your problem now.
30405820	30406820	There you go.
30406820	30407820	Oh, yours golden rings yours.
30407820	30408820	Thank you for all the lobsters.
30412820	30413820	Among us.
30415820	30417820	You've never played among us?
30417820	30419820	Deep Rock Galactica.
30419820	30421820	We can play Deep Rock together.
30422820	30423820	Can I force you guys
30423820	30425820	to play that Mains of Moria game with me?
30427820	30429820	I'm too scared to ask the girls to play
30429820	30431820	in case they absolutely despise it.
30431820	30432820	So,
30432820	30434820	although I may be able to convince Sheebie.
30437820	30439820	There's a Mains of Moria game.
30439820	30440820	It's like,
30440820	30442820	it's literally Deep Rock Galactica,
30442820	30443820	but Lord of the Rings,
30443820	30444820	Quidditch.
30445820	30446820	You want to try Warframe.
30446820	30448820	It's freeing up to four man squads.
30448820	30449820	Ooh.
30451820	30452820	I think you can force us
30452820	30453820	to do anything you want to try.
30460820	30461820	I haven't ever heard of it.
30461820	30462820	I've never got advertised well.
30462820	30464820	The only reason I've popped up for me
30464820	30466820	is because I'm on Lord of the Rings
30466820	30467820	side of TikTok.
30468820	30470820	So, if there's anything Lord of the Rings,
30470820	30472820	Lord of the Rings related.
30473820	30474820	Oh my God, we're going to level up.
30475820	30478820	40 freakin' seven.
30479820	30480820	Oh my gosh.
30482820	30483820	This is getting
30483820	30484820	insane.
30486820	30487820	Oh crap.
30489820	30490820	Thank you.
30490820	30491820	Thank you, Reflings.
30492820	30493820	I appreciate it.
30493820	30494820	Literally everyone feeding me.
30494820	30495820	We're all like,
30495820	30496820	fishing away, leveling up and stuff.
30501820	30503820	I think we'll play
30503820	30505820	RuneScape during,
30506820	30508820	on the third week of streams,
30508820	30511820	I think we might do a double RuneScape
30511820	30512820	to make sure we really get there,
30512820	30513820	XP-wise.
30513820	30515820	I'll break it up in between the week
30515820	30517820	just so it's not like a full day of RuneScape
30517820	30518820	and then one right after it.
30518820	30520820	Because I know RuneScape isn't for everyone.
30520820	30522820	I know it might be a bit
30522820	30524820	of a snooze fest,
30524820	30526820	but for me it's so satisfying.
30526820	30528820	Like, bigger number?
30529820	30530820	Bigger number?
30530820	30531820	Big number.
30531820	30532820	Big number.
30532820	30535820	Like, it's like really good for me.
30535820	30537820	But I guess maybe watching it
30537820	30538820	it might be better,
30538820	30539820	like if it was a compilation
30539820	30541820	or like a highlight, you know.
30542820	30543820	Still do Warframe.
30543820	30545820	It's the worst game to be a new player
30545820	30546820	and 100% confusing
30546820	30547820	and there's a neat tutorial.
30547820	30549820	Deep Rock Season 5 is a bit
30549820	30550820	of a horror show right now.
30551820	30552820	What is it?
30555820	30556820	Number go up.
30559820	30561820	RuneScape is definitely a talking stream,
30561820	30563820	like a datzu, like back and forth.
30563820	30565820	I like meme-ing with one of each other.
30566820	30568820	I'm like learning about the game and stuff.
30570820	30572820	I don't know enough about RuneScape.
30572820	30574820	Literally, I was in kindergarten when I said
30574820	30577820	the best I did as a kid was do cooking
30577820	30579820	and then probably do 40
30579820	30580820	and then that's the best.
30580820	30582820	I actually don't know how the game works.
30583820	30585820	So much lobster.
30585820	30586820	Rock lobster.
30591820	30593820	Nuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
30598820	30600820	Uh, b52 is anyone?
30604820	30607820	The Reflane is,
30607820	30609820	could you trouble you to play
30609820	30611820	Voices of the Void?
30611820	30612820	I don't know what that is.
30612820	30613820	Is it an MMO?
30613820	30615820	Or like single?
30616820	30617820	Or what?
30617820	30618820	What kind of game?
30618820	30631640	game. This review thing is a deep one. Final Fantasy 14. I was gonna give it a shot but
30631640	30641180	yeah. I never ended up playing it. I don't know if they say they roleplay a lot in it.
30641180	30648180	Honestly, I don't mind. It'll be fun to roleplay.
30648180	30659180	A roleplay is what though. I don't know what a roleplay is. I've had a choice to roleplay something.
30659180	30678180	I don't know. Save Heroes is free to play. Super hero animal. Oh, I think I said I wanted
30678180	30686620	to play Marvel Rivals. We might play that but I don't know if it's in beta or if that's
30686620	30692900	it fully out. I don't know. Oh, my tummy's wobbling. I don't know what to do.
30692900	30700860	Strony and her 100 husbands. Isn't this the life though? You know, you have to wait to
30700860	30707140	get your one-on-one attention but then that makes it so much more worth it. Why do I keep
30707140	30716740	fricking snail blinking? I'm gonna have to change that. Please stop blinking one at a time.
30716740	30729260	I'm gonna have to make the sensitivity different. Any trenches in trying Lord of the Rings online?
30729260	30735940	Like Shadow of the Rings online? You mean Elden Scrolls online? Or is there like a Lord
30735940	30743340	of the Rings online I have no idea about? I'm actually playing Final Fantasy while watching
30743340	30750060	the stream. Speaking of fact, cannot decide. I work in accounting and I'm the only guy
30750060	30755780	with nine girls in the office. Hey, what a ladies man. Check it out. You get a nice view
30755780	30763820	all day long. There's a Lord of the Rings. Maybe I've seen it and I'm just being a dum-dum.
30763820	30774220	I can't recall it off the toilet in the head. Should I move? I feel like I'm like in the
30774220	30782380	way here. Oh, I can't even access the fire. Oh, I can't even access the fire though. Dum-dum.
30782380	30787420	Oops, sorry. I'm already accepted. It's pretty old. Does Lord of the Rings online still even
30787420	30793300	have server? Yeah, I don't even think I've seen any gameplay of it. Unless I have in
30793420	30799460	my brains just not putting them two together. 171 successful cooks to go. Not sure how many
30799460	30808420	could in burnings, so probably ten more traps. Wow. We're at 81,000 XP on cooking. We need
30808420	30821500	20k more when it's mercy. 20 minutes on mercy. I don't know. If we could stop burning. There's
30821580	30825260	no way you're still headbanging over there. Are you not tired of clicking the button?
30828060	30833100	Brightly Lord of the Rings is microtransaction to heck. Okay, that's probably why I haven't
30833100	30840140	heard about it because everyone just saw how much of a grab it was. I lost my little face. Yeah,
30840140	30848460	maybe I am. Maybe I'm just headbanging. I mean, barbed village is a thing. Yeah, we might maybe
30848460	30860540	do a watch along of stuff for the later levels. Oh, 48, man. That's so good. Literally, I was aiming
30860540	30866140	for 40, and I'm so happy with what we've got. Obviously, special shout out to the reflins who
30866140	30872700	are supplying a ridiculous amount of money and fish and everything to me because it is insane.
30872700	30879660	And literally, the reflins down here that are just chilling and fishing away, they're just having
30879660	30885740	a good time leveling up fishing. What are your fishing levels? Hold on, let me type. Fishing
30885740	30896700	level check. Fishing level check. I'm still struggling early game fishing and cooking
30896700	30902540	so the lumberjoo shrimp, it takes forever to net some shrimp and then you burn them to heck.
30903100	30907340	If you guys want to catch up to her, I'll give you what I have left after stream.
30910140	30917740	Out of curiosity, are you avoiding profanity for any reason? A little bit. The AI can tell,
30917740	30923100	like the AI can read what my voice is, so I kind of try and swap out words over time
30923660	30929980	because I am quite outrageous at certain sections, so I try and tone it down as long
30929980	30936700	as you get a good 80-20 mix, then overall you're fine, which is why I swap out words sometimes.
30939340	30942220	I have enough eggs to be for night night twice, unfortunately.
30942540	30949820	A little refling's cute surprise of the stream. Oh, we keep burning them.
30952940	30959180	Oh lobbies, you're not as easy to cook as I thought. My little, my caviar.
30959180	30972860	But yes, I maybe need to think of, like, maybe we watch movies whilst we runescape
30972860	30976940	in the background or something. I mean, I can do a set of watch one movie,
30978140	30982780	obviously I can't show it, but I can show the timer so as we jump in at any point.
30983340	30985980	Maybe Harry Potter, do you guys like Harry Potter?
30988620	30996060	I've watched it through for the first time, a couple years back, I've not seen the full thing.
30996060	30999580	Not particularly, okay, maybe not, sorry, sorry, maybe not, maybe it's a girl's movie. Apologies.
31001580	31008780	Is there a C- John Wick series? We'll watch the John Wick series movies, that would be a good one.
31009340	31017580	I think everyone who's ready for RuneScape and Chill, honestly, John Wick RuneScape and Chill,
31018780	31023260	I'll put down the sound of the game like really low and we'll just watch the movie.
31023260	31028300	And it's just me going, in the movie, and then every time I level up I also go,
31031180	31034460	the first three movies of Harry Potter is pretty comfortable. Yeah, I guess really
31034540	31039500	dark at the end, which I don't. You could do a pool on which movies, yeah.
31041660	31048860	Just because of how long, like the grains are, I would kind of want to do series movies and
31052620	31057420	John Wick has three installments, I'm pretty sure, which is why I quite like that.
31058380	31069180	What about Shrek? Oh, I don't like the later Shrek. Is it Shrek happily ever after?
31075020	31076140	John Wick has four?
31079580	31084140	Have I seen the fourth one? I might know you haven't seen the fourth one. I don't know,
31084140	31093580	there's a fourth installment. Huh. I have a silly idea. What's your idea? Hmm, you have me curious.
31093580	31099340	Speak your truth. Stroney, how do you feel about Spider-Man movies? You want to watch the original
31099340	31105820	Spider-Man? Like the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man? So we can all have a gig a lot of the dancing.
31106780	31115100	Hmm. Tobey Maguire is a must, I don't know. I remember like a freaking babbling and watching the
31115100	31122940	movies practically. Yeah, the fourth, the final chapter is the fourth. Okay, okay, okay.
31125420	31129980	Stroney, did you know that Lord of the Rings trilogy lasts less than one of your endurance
31130060	31136060	streams? I'm saving myself. I'm saving myself for the Lord of the Rings on Christmas Day.
31136620	31144780	I am abstaining from such beautiful literature, such beautiful media that was created for human
31144780	31158220	consumption. So we're not going to watch them for this. The Sam Remy trilogy. Yes, Spider-Man 3.
31159020	31163900	I don't think I saw that one. I didn't see any of the Spider-Man's that have Emma Stone in it.
31167180	31172220	But I watched Spider-Man. We're all three of them were in the same movie.
31174380	31179020	And Tobey was like, yeah, it just comes out of my wrist. And the other two were like, huh?
31180300	31185980	Because I couldn't believe it. Because I think the new, oh, I'm really bad with people's names.
31185980	31191020	The new Spider-Man has to use nanotechnology from Iron Man to get his gunk out.
31193340	31199900	I don't know what Garth feels. Honestly, any of the Spider-Man movies, the movies are great. Okay.
31201660	31211260	49. Oh my gosh, 49 just popped. Feels good, man. Tom Holland. Ah, his name's Tom Holland.
31216940	31221740	I sing the praises of the apocrity diary for anyone who wants them. Is it a movie?
31223260	31228460	I'm not heard of it. Is it a game or a movie?
31233740	31241900	Oh, my tummy's so hungry. But I can't make food. I must grind. I must fish max. We are fish maxing.
31242540	31252860	We hitting 50 before Mercy. Before, I think so. We are like blasting through these levels. It's crazy.
31255180	31265020	0.7% of the weight of 99. Let's go. Oh, I read apocrity novel. Aren't there like seven Highlander
31265020	31276700	movies? It's Mad Max, a one-off movie. I think so. That new Mad Max, I think is good. The one that
31276700	31284860	was like, witness me, and he put spray can on his teeth. That one was pretty good. Those one-off
31284860	31290460	movies are... Oh, sorry. I just clicked. I misclicked. Oh, sorry, sorry. The grind. The grind, please.
31290460	31295420	The lobster maxing. I can't do it if I'm not misclicking. It was a misinput, misinput.
31296460	31303740	Fury Road was one. XP waste. No, don't bully me over my XP wasting.
31306060	31312700	It says I need 54 cooks, and I've got level 50. If I can stop burning them, maybe two more
31312700	31317820	inventories of lobbies. Oh, maybe two. We can do it in two.
31321740	31330860	Where are... If only I knew how many hours I spent bank standing. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
31333340	31339420	I think your ping may be blessed, possibly. Get that fire on. Get that fire on. Get that lobby on the
31339420	31347900	fire. Not the misinput. Blade Runner? Ooh, that's a good suggestion.
31351660	31359020	I thought about because of the Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling. I don't know why that was so hard to
31359020	31364380	say Ryan. Because of the Ryan Gosling movies, I thought it would be funny if we did like a six
31364460	31370860	girl watch along of it, like all six of us watching it. And then whenever Ryan comes on screen,
31370860	31375340	all of us can be like, oh, that's literally my refling. That's literally my like,
31375340	31378700	bleeding heart. That's literally my snippet. That's literally my pinpal.
31382860	31390780	I'm on world 380 at Barbarian Village. Unfortunately, I'm literally about to go off in 13 minutes.
31391100	31396700	Because Mercy's coming online. And literally, oh my god, that's my refling. Oh my god, my refling's
31396700	31400780	so strong. I'm gonna just be like complimenting you the entire stream.
31405180	31409900	Okay, it says 34 more lobsters. Okay, this time, two more inventories. I'll do it.
31410460	31412540	Can't stop burning these lobbies.
31413100	31413900	Wow.
31417980	31423900	That Gosling, literally. I wouldn't mind rewatching The Blade Runner because I didn't like fully
31423900	31432940	comprehend it at first. So it'd be nice to like see it again, kind of mildly knowing what happens.
31433580	31439180	Have you watched Seven Cycle Path? Movie before? No, I haven't. I'm not sure what that is. That
31439180	31447580	Gosling, literally. Can't wait to see us all together again. Can't wait as well.
31447580	31451580	We've got our first group collab, and then we've got our one-on-one collab coming out soon again.
31454940	31458700	So I'm gonna see. Can I please stop burning these lobbies, please?
31470140	31478140	I think I can do it. But yes. I think I said a little bit before, we're a little bit limited
31478140	31483740	on multiplayer games that we can all play together, so I think I will encourage like some
31483740	31496860	trio collabs or quad man collabs at some point, but it'll be fun to see everyone's like dynamic
31496940	31500060	with each other. I hope no one's scared of me.
31500860	31508620	Strawny smells, how dare you? How do your accusations? I smell like burnt lobster, burnt
31508620	31516140	shrimp, burnt trout, burnt salmon, burnt pike. I smell like burnt everything because I can't stop
31516140	31522620	freaking messing up. I need to kick 13 lobsters in the snatch and I level up, and I burn three in a
31522620	31531340	row, of course, when I say that. Four in a row! That's more like it. Trying to upset me video game,
31532460	31537020	it's working. I saw the fish she's handling, so sniff the stuff.
31539100	31544140	Looking forward to main crash shenanigans. Yeah, that's in July. July shenanigans.
31545100	31553180	I'm not beating the front end. Eating Strawny's burnt food sign me up. Oh, no, those are carcinogenic.
31553180	31560380	You're not supposed to eat burnt any kind of food. Wait, why did she smell like fish? We're the ones
31560380	31569660	who are questioning. We did it! We're 50! We actually did it, no way. Mercy's up in 10.
31570620	31579340	No, we've got 50. That's insane. Thank you so much, we've got 50.
31583260	31587420	And that was like messing about questing as well and all that.
31588060	31600300	I look forward to less burning. M-A-B-Zoo, congrats. Honestly, I hope I'll stop burning.
31600300	31612620	Oh my god, I'm so MLG pro at cutting fish. Ah! I'll send the crunch.
31613260	31617820	It says the value is 2.3k for that batch of lobsters?
31619900	31621900	I thought lobsters were a money maker.
31626060	31633500	Okay, well, I hope to see you play old school again. Yeah, we'll play it once next week on week two
31633500	31640220	and then we'll play it twice on week three during the week, but I'll split it up just in case
31640220	31645420	because I don't know. RuneScape isn't the most interesting. Not anymore with all the bots.
31648140	31653820	Maybe the bots aren't so bad after all. Controversion. You can't say that. You can't say that.
31656060	31659020	They wear a really long time ago. I'm wondering if that's what I remember.
31661740	31668860	Bots keep the lobsters cheap. I'm wondering how the economy in RuneScape would look
31668940	31676380	if bots were like completely forbidden, like if they managed to like completely eradicate them.
31677900	31682940	I'm wondering if it would be an uproar because everything would get so expensive, you know?
31685260	31686620	Curious, curious.
31692700	31694380	We're learning, we're learning.
31695340	31700220	Stony, Iron Man win. Oh, good luck with that. Are you joking?
31702220	31709980	It's hardcore Iron Man. You can't use bank. Iron Man is what? You lose everything when you perish?
31712220	31716380	Sorry, I'm probably standing on everyone right now.
31717100	31726940	I feel like it would probably like been working on a mech and AC6 for whatever you get on it.
31729660	31732940	Ultimate Iron Man, no bank, hardcore, lose stats when that. Yeah.
31736060	31744620	Are you serious? Do you know how much money I've made today? That's 20 million. No way I've been
31744620	31755900	given 20 million. Hello? Don't people like spend like actual real-world currency to get this kind
31755900	31762220	of going? Gold and coin together is going just like you should know. I'm putting this in the bank.
31762220	31767020	Wait, you said there was a bank up here. Hold on. Hold on, mommy's going to the bank. She'll be back
31767020	31772140	in a second. There's a bank up here? Is that one of these buildings? That looks like a ruined building.
31774860	31778220	Oh, I'm getting scared. I hope I don't get attacked. You have what level are you people?
31778860	31785420	Identify yourselves. Okay, no, I must be off of it. Oh, wait, wait, I see banker booth. We found it.
31786300	31789660	We're finally in Edgeville. This is where I was born.
31791980	31796540	Right, let's get this money nice and safe and tidy in here because oh my gosh.
31797500	31801500	Hey, leather gloves. Can I put that on? Is that going to like add to my defense?
31802140	31808620	Oh my gosh, leather gloves. That's what I needed. Oh, I'll check it out. Oh my god, I'm starting.
31810860	31815020	Whoa, that's right. Whoa, the bend of my arm is amazing.
31819100	31824460	We did it. We did it. All right, let me come back briefly. No, don't cry. Don't cry. Look over and
31824460	31829340	you're crying. No, don't cry. I'm right here. I'm just stunning on the bank because I'm really scared.
31830300	31834060	I didn't even know there was a freaking thing up there. Well, now I know there's a bank up there.
31834060	31842300	I am expanding my runescape knowledge. Wow, okay, okay, we're here. I think I might need to...
31844860	31849180	Can I get level 51? Whoa, wait a minute. Can I even cook these?
31851660	31853020	Can I cook swordfish?
31853020	31861580	Oh, I can. What did they get? Oh, burnt it. 140.
31864140	31867660	It says I have to cook 56 swordfish to already level up again.
31868620	31874780	Wait, it's taking down two? It's just 50. It's literally going down by two. 48.
31875180	31886540	47. Wait, what? I'm going crazy. Is that a chef hat? It is. It's a golden chef hat and a golden apron.
31886540	31888540	A refling literally gave me it.
31894300	31895580	Oh, I just started doing something.
31897980	31902140	You should be able to buy enough materials for 99 cooking with five million coins alone.
31902700	31907260	I've got, well, I've got 20. We might as well go fletching while we're at it. Will we do crafting?
31909020	31912780	Jeez. Not me becoming a runescape player overnight.
31914940	31921900	Like a runescape skillar, sorry. Oh my goodness, that swordfish is insane.
31921900	31927660	We're at 31. Yeah, it's like recalculating, as you guys see. It's trying to do the math, but oof.
31927820	31929820	That's insane.
31932140	31936140	How much is it on the ground? For swordfish, it's 4k for that lot.
31936700	31938700	It just seems like a shame that I'm kind of wasting that vote.
31940060	31944460	Oh, even more. Goodbye, those who have to go.
31945500	31950780	Yes, please don't worry if you have to go now. I'm about to read in some mercy to give myself a
31950780	31957020	vocal rest before I do ASMR, I believe, tomorrow. And then it's the sweet stream.
31957900	31962780	Yes. So please don't worry if you have to go. I'm literally just cooking away
31964300	31969820	an experience in swordfish XT. I sent for Scottish anime women.
31971900	31974860	Thanks for something for me. I sent for replays.
31977100	31983900	Unfathomable progress, honestly. Oh yeah, buy out those stats. Yeah, we're going to get it.
31988300	31994060	Rest well, rest well. I also shrimped for her. Oh yeah, you shrimped for me because I'm a
31994060	31999900	mesipish. I'm a sea animal, so you shrimped for me. And we're head banging away.
32008540	32013740	I'll wait the ride. I'll ask Mercy to put bad jokes written all over your new clothes design.
32013740	32017660	I'm so curious what she comes up with, like so, so curious.
32019740	32028300	Oh my god, we're 110 KXP for cooking. That's just amazing.
32031820	32035180	Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. And there's more where it came from.
32035660	32041500	Not going to lie, I'd be part of that army if I played RuneScape at all.
32043100	32047580	Someone was like, oh yeah, start up a guild. And I'm like, I've never done it. I don't even know how to do it.
32049580	32055340	Well, we'll just play as free agents, if you will. We're free agents. Free refling.
32055820	32063580	We sent for each other a circling of scents, if you will.
32064940	32069740	Shrimping hard. The amount of progress is only possible with an army of shrimps.
32070540	32074780	My little shrimpers. Oh fine, I guess you are my little shrimpers.
32075580	32083900	Don't guild members get XP boosts, do they? What for, like, raids?
32086060	32090860	Like streams to help Algo. Watch Mercy and RuneScape schedule. Yeah!
32093340	32101180	51 on day one, 51. That is an insane progress.

32107900	32111420	Bruh. Bruh. Bruh.
32113260	32118220	And that's with doing, like, free quests and stuff together.

32139020	32140620	the grand exchange economy?

32153740	32155340	Okay, it's rough. I guess it's dangerous.
32157980	32158780	Hydration check.
32162060	32164540	It's 1pm. Uh, is Mercy on?
32166300	32168940	Wait, hold on. I'm gonna need to make sure I'm redirecting.
