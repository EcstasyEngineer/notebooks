WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah, A.C. finish up.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Good A.C.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
She wasn't supposed to do that shit.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
There you go.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Ah, I'm a fucking talk of the word.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
I can hear myself.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Mike, can I hear myself?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Please.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Okay, okay, okay.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Right.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Ugh.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
How did A.C. do in her 2.0?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
She was adorable, right?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
She was freaking amazing.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
I turned down my music this time because during debut it was unbelievably loud and I didn't

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
catch it.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Like a dumbass.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
But hey ho.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Right.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm going to do two streams.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
This stream is dedicated to exposing VLR.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
The YouTube agency.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
The YouTube agency.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
That VTuber agency, okay?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Now, I'm very unprofessional.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm very scatterbrained.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm very XYZ, you know.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
So, I am going to try my best to stick to a one hour of just exposing the agency.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I will talk.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
I will take questions at the end.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I can see chat.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I can read chat.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I can interact with you.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
During debut, you're not really supposed to interact that much.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
But I can 100% completely tune in on your forehead and all that.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
So, don't worry.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Don't worry.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It will be three hours long.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Bruh.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
No, she be.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm trying to read, isn't it?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
That's why I'm like, right.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
One hour for this and then one hour for my thing.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Right.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Okay.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Okay.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
What's a Z?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Is that a rune in the, what?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
What?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Don't be trolling with my accent already.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Right, right, right.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
One, one, one, one, one.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Let's begin at the very start.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
And by start, I mean whatever I could gather notes on very quickly.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Right.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Well, we start with the application.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Sorry.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm rubbing my eyeball.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Currently got a fricking rogue eyelash in it.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm jumping straight into it.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm not stalling.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Okay.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
And this is at the wrong part.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Okay.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm talking about the applications first.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Hold on.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Let me just, okay.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Good.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Okay.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
That's not the starting one.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Okay.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
This is the starting one.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
So, on the VLR website, you will notice there was a few things slightly different than

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
what the average VTuber agency asks for.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Okay.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Most VTuber agencies go, hey, we don't care what gender you are.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Thanks to entertainment laws, I could say whamen only.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Sorry, guys.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
But you want to start a male VTuber agency?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Absolutely.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Nothing's holding you back.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I assure you.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
However, me, I'm looking for fannies to join.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Okay.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
You know what?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
But we also had more requirements as well.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Okay.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
Those requirements were you had to have experience being a naughty, naughty.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Doesn't matter what kind.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
As long as you had some sort of variation, you're going to be comfortable with it.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
So, just think about the application pool and how it gets lower and lower.

03:27.000 --> 03:36.000
And most VTuber agencies, for whatever reason, lie to your face and go, you can apply even

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
if you don't have any experience.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Liars.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
They are wasting your time.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
Do not believe them and do not apply to agencies that say that you do not have to be a content

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
creator prior to applying for them.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
You're wasting your time.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
They are wasting your time and they do not deserve.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
You don't deserve that.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Seriously, you don't deserve that.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
It's such a freaking waste, okay?

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
And the Veiler website had a redonkulous amount of information on it or they knew the split

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
off the bat or they knew what was happening with merchandise sales off the bat.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
They are at freaking, put my soul into making that website as clear as possible.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Okay?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
So, no time wasters.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Give or take, we had 320 applications.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Lovely girls.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
However, that meant for every one model.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I was a preselected talent if you didn't know.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Hi, I was inks, codename inks.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah.

04:35.000 --> 04:44.000
So, for every one model, we had 34 girls essentially battling it out to be the right fit.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
And it was not easy.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Okay, it was not easy.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
She put that whole straw noose in our website.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Wait, that's inks?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I shut up.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Right.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
For the most popular picked character, design wise,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
what was she be?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Don't be fooled by that color.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
That's not pins.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
That's a light blue for any.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Okay?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So, the majority said put me on anyone.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Put me where you fit.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
You want to fit me.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Okay?

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
So, ropes was the most picked.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
It ropes.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
She be was the most picked.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And then I see was the second.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And then Azura was the third.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And then Mercy was the second.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
And then the very last picked.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh dear, if they didn't like your silhouette.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm like, are you kidding me?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm sorry.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I love creepy little girl designs.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm just going to leave it at that.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I love little creepy things.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
It's a fucking gorgeous design.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I don't care what anyone said.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
No one wanted to be me.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Shonton behavior.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Shonton.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
And then obviously I cannot show the fricking private information of those who applied.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
So, I can just show you these fun pie charts about the application process.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
So, people say the reason why Veeler asked if your PC was weak,

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
because we have the funds to purchase an entire new PC for you,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
which we did for one talent.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
So, enjoy that, the new PC hen.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
But yeah, we had the funds to completely give you the equipment you needed.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
They all got three deals that they can use for ASMR streams.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
They'll let SMBs for streaming if they didn't have it.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So, we also gave a sign-on bonus as well,

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
because we had two months to kind of prepare for the debuts and all that.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
And it's quite a lot to ask someone to, you know, kind of give your full focus,

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
if you will, to a new agency where there's not an income source.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
So, all the girls also got a sign-on bonus of 420 US dollars,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
but I don't think any agency has done before.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
And literally, it's like the most basic common courtesy.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Like, seriously. Like, I guess.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Seriously, Veeler, it's planning to get any money, because it sounds like it is...

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Oh, well, we'll talk about the profits a little bit.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
I also, in the application form, you could tell us if you wanted to have a callback,

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
if we find you might be suitable for a later character if we were to expand.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Now, I'm going to say this publicly right now.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
No one has been contacted for a callback.

07:33.000 --> 07:44.000
The reason for that is because it's a bit of a cheek to have someone basically wait for a year

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
for a non-guaranteed slot in an agency.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
And I didn't want anyone hanging about maybe pausing plans they have,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
like, because some people might want to, you know, get a 2.0 model,

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
some people want to maybe start up as a new VTuber, like, type thing with a new persona.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Like, I just didn't want anyone to be at that stage.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
So, I'll just say publicly now, no one has been contacted for a thingy.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
But yes.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Okay, so that was kind of the application process.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
The interview process.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm more than happy for the girls to talk about the interview process with me.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Basically, if you're interested in Veeler, I was the barrier, okay?

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
I was the one reviewing you and looking at your content, if you applied,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
and I was like you and you, you know.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
It's a bit awkward.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I'll say this part out loud.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
It was a bit morally, hmm,

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
because I was judging VTubers that had way more streaming experience than me

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
to be like, oh, you're worthy to come in or not.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And it's like, hmm, it wasn't a nice feeling.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Kind of like being like, no, but you can't want me.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Right, okay, questions.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Most basic, why are you called Veeler?

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Now, check out the V at the start, virtual,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
as most agencies start with a V for virtual, okay?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And then the A.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Okay, now put V and A together, okay?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
What do you get?

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
You get voice acting, hmm, voice acting, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Okay, and the girls are doing amateur voice acting audios.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Oh my God, oh my God, you did it.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
You did it.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
You put it together too.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Also, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Let's read it together.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Let's read it together.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
V, okay, and then imagine if there was an imaginary dash.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Allure, allure, as if the girls were alluring.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Oh my, oh my God.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Put it together.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
We've done it, lads.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
We've cracked the fucking case.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Okay, that's why it's called failure.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
There's no other thing to it, okay?

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
I thought it was pretty self-explanatory,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
but it wasn't, okay?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
It wasn't.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
I was like, V, allure, okay?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
V, allure.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
But we've got so many different pronunciations.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I think if you have an American, you're like, V, allure.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
And it's like, I never really thought about other accents saying it

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
because I was like, hmm, one accent, but here you go.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Anya, questions?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Why are you called Viller?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
How hand on are you with the talents?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
The talents can do whatever the fuck they want.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
They do not come to me for permission.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
They don't have to come to me.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Shawnee, I want to do this.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I want to do it.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
The only thing they come to me with is they go,

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I want a project.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I want this.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I want that.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I want this asset.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Then they come to me and I sugar mummy them.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
And I'll be like, there you go, darlin'.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Allure's 10, pop your pop.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
The girls do what they want.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
They do not need permission for in real life hand-to-cam streams,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
for example.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
None of that shit.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
You guys have to understand,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
we're all adults here.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
I am not going to treat anyone like they're a fucking child

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
and they need permission from me to work.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Okay?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Because as it stands, they're, you know,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
doing work and streaming and all that,

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
you do not need permission to work.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Okay?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
So we don't do none of that shit around here.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
One of the funniest comments I had seen so far

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
was, uh, management's going to run away with the money, aren't we?

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Oh, you've caught me.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
You've caught me.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Was the 80-20 split showing my corporation greed?

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
Was the 100% merch sales to the talent showing my corporation greed?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Oh no!

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
Oh, my plans have been foiled.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
You've seen right through my plans to steal from these girls.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Mate.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Mate.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Mate.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
You have no concept of how much love has gone into this.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
You have no concept.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
But thank you for your comment.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
The entire development team had a nice chuckle at you, mate.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
That was some basic questions, okay?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Now, the accusations.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I'm sorry.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
The accusations, I can't outrun them.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It's time.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
I can't believe I'm saying this.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
But it's true.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
The background music's are based on Sonic Heroes' OST.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm sorry.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
It was the autism, your honor.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I couldn't stop it.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
Okay, I'm sorry, but Mercy's background music is based after

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
Billet Station from Sonic Heroes' OST.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
MAP's is after Mystic Mansion.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm so sorry.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Azura's is after Frog Forest.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I'm sorry.

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
And Shavey's, it's after Strange Guys and AC and Casino Park.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And then me, Bingo Highway.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Because, you know, Bingo Highway has a little bit of ear to ear.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And then it also has it in my background music.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
You can really hear it in Emmys and Mercy's, for example.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Okay, it's true.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
It's true.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I brought to them that your honor.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Yes.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Well, you started VTuber Agency and then you made the background music

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
based after an old game called Sonic Heroes' OST.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, I did.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
What are you going to do about it, huh?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Are you going to fart?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Are you going to fart and sniff it or something?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Right, these are spoilers.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Spoilers up ahead.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Spoilers.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Okay.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
These are badges and emote spoilers.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Now, because of the way the agency is set,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
so the girls couldn't pick their emotes at the stage,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
so I got them emotes.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I just guessed what emotes they'd like.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
So some big spoilers for emotes ahead.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
If you don't want to know what the emotes are for when their membership open,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
please look away.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I'm going to burp in a second.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Oh, beautiful.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
And I also have badges, okay?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
There's also going to be badges.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Spoilers.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Spoilers.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Spoilers.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Oh, wait.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
No.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
No.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
No.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Azura.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Azura.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Not right now.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Azura.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
No.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I say no.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
No.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Right.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Here we go.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Okay.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Hold on.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Hold on.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Hold on.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Special shout-out to the concept artists of the Allure.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
His name is Squishy Girl.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
So these are just the concept artists for Azura's membership link.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Okay.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Hmm.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
A bit of milk themed.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Okay.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
A bit of milk themed.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Hmm.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Okay.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
This is...

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Oh!

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Little acicle.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
Acicle is a little baby polar bear with a dummy or a binky if you're American.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
And then it goes into two years.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
We can't super chat.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
No.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Oh!

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
I will talk about that.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm at 2.0.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
But right now I need to speed run through this because I'm going to start yapping.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Little emmers.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Emmers is pumpkin themed.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
I absolutely adore her pumpkin little bunches.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And she's spooky pumpkin.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Okay.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
These are already fully ordered and everything.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
So don't worry.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
The girls are...

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I've planned this out.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I've had plenty of time.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I've planned this out.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I'll show you.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
I have had five babies sitting in my womb for a year.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Okay.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
They have just been birthed from my loins.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
As you can tell.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Merces.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Hmm.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Very fit.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Very fit.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I like Hawaii name.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Uh-huh.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Um.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I will answer any questions at the end.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Right now I'm just trying to zoom through it.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Whoa!

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Whoa!

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Welcome.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
I'll tell them also for Shibi.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
You don't want a little gimp mask on?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Come on.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Admit it.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
You want a gimp mask on?

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
I'm sure Shibi would like to see you with one on.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Discord logo.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Where?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Shut up.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Where?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Wait, what?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Discord logo.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Are you trolling me?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Are you trolling me?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I'm being trolled.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I just got trolled reading that.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Oh, and then this one.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Uh.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I got shells.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.740
But if you look in the corner, it says, this shell you waiting for.

16:20.740 --> 16:21.740
Join up nowhere else.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.000
I'm not squinting around.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
The shape remains as of this.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Oh, right.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Okay.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I just get confused.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
I just get confused.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Oh, actually that's another thing.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
I'm going to bully Emmy with my Scottish French at some point.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I absolutely love it.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
I love it.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Okay.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Now, look away if you don't want spoilers for the emotes that I got for the girls.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Okay.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.760
I just want to say I bought, I got these in advance.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.320
I didn't meet the girls at this point.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.320
I hadn't met them.

16:50.320 --> 16:54.000
I got these in advance for the girls get to pick all the emotes that follow afterwards.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Okay.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
So these are spoilers.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Is she biting your arm?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Is there a given up?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Or in her voice?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I can't do it.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Is there a given up?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Or in her voice?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I can't do it.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
She be bonk.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
I'm fine.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
You can call me a long bonk.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Loading for Emmy.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Merci.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Kudos.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Let me kudos.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Azu kudos.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Let me hand.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Peppy hands.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
And then drew.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
And then eh.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
I don't even know what to call that.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Just eh.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
And then ah.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm just going to like make the sound that I think these emotes portray.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Okay.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Ah.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Go, go, go.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Go.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Go.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Go.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Go.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Go.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Go.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Go.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Go.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Go.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Go.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Go.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Go.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Go.

17:52.000 --> 18:03.000
No, that's sounds like

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
the reflex.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
對.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yes.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Yes.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Yes.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Yes.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Her.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
Guess I have enough.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yes.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Yes.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yes.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Ah

18:30.440 --> 18:32.440
We still got a few more go

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I

19:11.800 --> 19:14.020
Don't know how to make the sound of a blade swing

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Oh

19:39.840 --> 19:41.840
Last one

19:42.280 --> 19:45.960
Did you like it? Oh, when I lose track and my hypnosis comes on

19:48.120 --> 19:50.120
Do you like that? Yeah, I was good

19:51.120 --> 19:55.440
Okay, a little spoiler in the most as I said the girls get to pick their emotes

19:56.040 --> 20:00.920
After this next batch because obviously I had to order it in of the rounds because I didn't know them yet

20:03.120 --> 20:08.480
Lore okay, so this is this is super behind-the-scenes stuff. So again squishy girl

20:10.040 --> 20:16.800
Conceptualize the lore so this is what an example of a lore storyboard looks like I'm giving you the hints

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
So this is a zero for example

20:18.960 --> 20:25.760
So as you can see at the script right away the earth was driven L baron in its infancy then from dust to darkness was the first family

20:25.760 --> 20:31.160
So this is called concept art for the lore that was given to T Tema Chi Tema Chi

20:31.160 --> 20:33.960
I would say T Matt T, but that's my accent

20:34.760 --> 20:40.840
So that was this is these they're kind of it gives an idea of Tamachi of what she

20:41.560 --> 20:42.840
Chant

20:42.840 --> 20:45.840
Chant

20:45.840 --> 20:48.680
Let's go squishy girls and chap, but you know, he's

20:51.800 --> 20:56.800
So I'll give you a very quick example of what half wait hold on hold on hold on

20:56.800 --> 20:58.800
Let me click let me click let me click let me click

21:00.240 --> 21:04.400
So to give you a very quick example, I can only do it for my lore

21:05.400 --> 21:11.080
But here are the first three concept panels so ghoul did the concept panels along with the script

21:11.120 --> 21:17.440
So concept one two and three and then to match you saw it and then come oh shit

21:17.840 --> 21:23.620
It's a bit big. Oh down a minute. Hold on. Hold on. It's very scuffed

21:27.720 --> 21:31.800
So to match he comes back with the sketch and you know

21:32.760 --> 21:34.760
It's so literally we go from

21:35.320 --> 21:40.640
Well the top corner one to to the sketch so she comes back with a sketch absolutely beautiful garden

21:42.160 --> 21:50.000
Beautiful beautiful and she then with the approval of the storyboard and sketch then the full images come through

21:50.000 --> 21:56.720
And these come through all layered these are all there the reason why we could get the little images to move about was

21:57.040 --> 22:03.880
To match he just works so diligently so hard. They were an absolute pleasure to work with I cannot recommend to match

22:03.880 --> 22:05.880
She enough for like

22:06.680 --> 22:11.760
You know, I gave her a lot of work. I could I could you know, I was insane work

22:11.760 --> 22:15.760
But as you can see from the finished result of the lures to matchy

22:19.880 --> 22:25.880
And beautiful that I look five star meal all the Michelin stars or however

22:26.800 --> 22:28.800
Michelin stars work

22:29.200 --> 22:35.520
But yes, so that's the behind-the-scenes of kind of the development of the lore so again squishy girl

22:36.000 --> 22:38.520
Not only did he do the storyboard?

22:38.520 --> 22:41.520
He also did the scripts in the background lures of the girls

22:41.520 --> 22:45.160
I will come back to the development of the girls very shortly

22:46.200 --> 22:53.600
And if you didn't know the merches are now out for the girls, but again in order to help artists it's so

22:54.440 --> 22:57.760
To make things such a smooth process behind the scene and

22:59.760 --> 23:04.240
Having a concept artist to give the actual artists

23:05.000 --> 23:11.760
An idea of what you want helps so I hope I'm not spoiling the merch that's coming out, but this is a Zura

23:13.520 --> 23:20.440
Little aces cons these are concepts of the merchandise that you see on who we mark it right now. I'll talk about it now and

23:21.440 --> 23:25.000
Then a little mersey and she be and

23:25.920 --> 23:29.680
Yeah, again, these are just concepts a beautiful behind-the-scenes stuff

23:29.680 --> 23:34.240
It's really nice getting a thingy a little thingy so early development

23:34.240 --> 23:39.200
Okay, now now you're gonna start cringing at a few of the things that come up shortly, but

23:43.800 --> 23:47.400
Mmm, please please read please read

23:48.320 --> 23:50.320
Thank you for reading

23:50.440 --> 23:54.760
If we need to hire talent managers, we will open a position

23:54.760 --> 24:02.760
I am so thankful for everyone applying, but for God's sake some of you are glowing for grooming the girls

24:02.760 --> 24:07.000
I kid you not. I've had some emails that are like

24:07.720 --> 24:09.480
Hi

24:09.480 --> 24:11.480
I want to be a talent manager

24:11.640 --> 24:18.080
No portfolio, no history, no evidence of anything, like no communication

24:18.080 --> 24:23.640
I'm so thankful you want to work for the girls. I'm so thankful you want to groom them because you like them that much

24:24.200 --> 24:30.400
My guy this agency we groom you. Full stop. That's the sense. Okay, so nice try

24:30.400 --> 24:36.160
But if I need talent managers, I'll post on the website for the jobs that we need

24:36.680 --> 24:44.680
Right, okay, this is where the cringe comes in. This is where the really the developmental cringe comes in, okay

24:46.280 --> 24:50.680
So I'm gonna read it out to you. Don't worry if you can't read neither can I but I'll try my best to read it out

24:53.000 --> 25:00.440
So when it comes to concepts, okay, as you'll notice these girls don't have names because

25:01.360 --> 25:03.800
Because the girls started without names. That's how it was

25:04.240 --> 25:10.040
So for the lore for girl one, it was it was the best we got to hang out together

25:10.040 --> 25:12.720
We ordered food and watch anime all snuggled up

25:12.720 --> 25:14.840
I couldn't have asked for anything more that night

25:14.840 --> 25:20.800
It was a shame that the truth never came out that I could never tell my redacted that I love him before it was too late

25:20.800 --> 25:26.000
It's not fair now. I'm some what I know I'm somewhere. Don't recognize and I'll never see him again

25:26.000 --> 25:28.280
You'll still watch over me from where you are now, though

25:29.040 --> 25:34.480
Hmm wonder wonder who that is. Um, but these are kind of description lores very quick

25:36.120 --> 25:38.120
girl lore 2

25:40.440 --> 25:44.680
When there's no one around to spoil what am I gonna do with myself?

25:44.680 --> 25:49.680
I've got no purpose if I don't have a sweet heart to show my love, okay

25:50.320 --> 25:55.440
That was I was a Zura that was a Zura that's where she started from see

25:56.200 --> 26:00.600
Asura was given more of a kind of servant goddess role, but that definitely didn't really come into play

26:02.320 --> 26:05.360
Mersey oh then pie. I know you're around here

26:05.360 --> 26:11.840
You're playing a game with me aren't you thinking you can take me to an unfamiliar surrounding so I'd stop use flash, baby

26:11.840 --> 26:18.280
I love you far too much to ever give up the chase. Isn't it fun when your heart is practically beating out of your chest?

26:18.800 --> 26:21.720
Manic I do manic laughter, but Mersey absolutely fucking

26:23.680 --> 26:30.360
She mugs me with her laugh. Oh wait, you're not Senpai, but you could be from the ones of you know, if you don't know mercy kind of

26:31.960 --> 26:33.960
You know, you know how it goes

26:34.760 --> 26:36.360
for

26:36.360 --> 26:38.360
for

26:39.320 --> 26:43.320
For okay for I have

26:44.160 --> 26:47.640
You're gonna find out why four is so confusing four is icy

26:48.520 --> 26:52.680
I quit whoever made this game who even made this game and read that wrong

26:52.680 --> 26:54.440
Whoever even made this game in the first place

26:54.440 --> 27:00.760
What's the point and putting achievements in a game if only 0.2% of the player base can even achieve it screw this

27:00.760 --> 27:02.760
I'm going on a really

27:03.160 --> 27:08.360
Website, okay. Now. What's the category tonight? Oh, let's do a random rule at our discord, okay?

27:10.200 --> 27:16.600
As you can see aces come a very long way, okay, that's not aces lore at all. That's not our concept

27:16.600 --> 27:18.600
We're not even there. Okay

27:18.680 --> 27:25.320
Lore 5 I cannot for the life of me understand how guys work. How do their brains even function?

27:25.720 --> 27:28.200
If only there was some sort of way

27:29.240 --> 27:31.880
I could get them to be truthful with me

27:33.880 --> 27:35.880
Um and

27:36.680 --> 27:42.520
Yeah, so I always started with a hypno theme. Obviously I got to pick what the fuck I want to be because I was there from the start

27:43.080 --> 27:47.000
I was always going to have hypno. I just didn't know what angle we were going for

27:47.720 --> 27:48.920
and then

27:48.920 --> 27:55.080
I got conceptualized to wanting to kill all humanity. So yeah, I didn't do that part by the way before you're like, oh my god

27:56.040 --> 27:58.040
now

27:58.600 --> 28:01.560
Sorry, I'm rubbing my face heat and then six. Um

28:04.600 --> 28:10.200
Six, uh, it should be yeah, um, I've had it bunny boys are pathetic. They can never keep up with me

28:10.280 --> 28:13.240
And I don't know why I bother wasting my time. I just need something different

28:13.560 --> 28:19.000
Human males surely can keep up with this stamina of my needs type thing. Okay, so that's how the girls started

28:19.080 --> 28:21.080
Okay, they all started deeply departed

28:23.000 --> 28:29.480
So that's it. All right. Okay. This is a really fun. This is I hated naming everyone. I hate that

28:29.560 --> 28:36.440
I hate that the the reason why you don't see me be zoo right now is because me be zoo was named correctly

28:37.000 --> 28:43.320
Azura, you were a nightmare to name. Oh my god. I went through so many names

28:43.720 --> 28:46.360
I literally came up with stacey milkerton

28:46.920 --> 28:50.360
Azura, you were so hard to name for no reason

28:50.680 --> 28:59.640
You can literally see how desperate I was getting through your name. I was like stacey milkerton. Miss milkerton milk the pillow show

29:00.040 --> 29:02.040
Show me darling in french

29:02.440 --> 29:04.440
Yeah, right. She's a goat god

29:04.840 --> 29:11.320
Faunus in this milfu in this milf shoe milf is in milf for you

29:11.960 --> 29:14.680
Fondue la fondue la bosom azura

29:15.240 --> 29:20.440
Daily, which is the wrong spelling in french and then finally we got to azura delay. Oh

29:21.240 --> 29:25.320
My god. Do you know do you see the techniques to fondue la bosom as well?

29:25.960 --> 29:27.960
That's because I approved

29:28.120 --> 29:31.480
That name for azura as fondue la bosom

29:32.280 --> 29:34.280
What was I thinking?

29:35.320 --> 29:37.320
Right

29:37.720 --> 29:41.240
Okay, now this one's about this is a real behind the scenes lore

29:42.280 --> 29:45.160
Mersey was originally stavita

29:46.520 --> 29:47.640
Right

29:47.640 --> 29:48.600
bread

29:48.600 --> 29:54.360
What was I thinking and then if she was eastern european, we were going to change it to stavita

29:55.160 --> 29:58.040
What was that smooton and then I

29:58.520 --> 30:03.960
Approved the name karam beat so instead of karam bet as in sharp weapon

30:04.760 --> 30:06.760
beat

30:14.040 --> 30:17.800
So the fun fact is that it's not a fun fact. I'm such a dumb ass

30:18.920 --> 30:20.920
Karam's name got past development

30:22.200 --> 30:26.760
So mersey was called karam until about a month ago. It was awful

30:29.000 --> 30:33.640
Don't let me cook ever again. I'm not naming anyone after this

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
right ac

30:37.320 --> 30:41.000
ac is a lie. Do you want to know what ac's real name was?

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
Joy stick with an eye

30:45.320 --> 30:52.680
ac was not developed as a polar bear. I'm going to show you her developmental are very shortly. Her name was joy stick

30:53.720 --> 30:55.720
Yes, that's true

30:56.120 --> 31:00.120
Now ac uh, umka is russian unbelievably

31:00.120 --> 31:05.880
What are the odds because ac does speak russian but her concept did name was always ac we liked ac from the star

31:05.960 --> 31:07.960
Okay, we liked ac from the star

31:08.680 --> 31:15.720
So it was ac umka, which I think means bear or paw and russian. I can't remember. It's one or the other something like that

31:16.200 --> 31:18.200
and and then ac show

31:18.600 --> 31:20.040
um

31:20.040 --> 31:25.000
For ac hot as in opposites, but she was always going to be a polar bear

31:25.960 --> 31:27.720
uh, and then

31:27.720 --> 31:29.720
We got bander

31:29.720 --> 31:32.920
I feel like bander is that it's like a kind of mythological

31:33.800 --> 31:35.320
angle

31:35.320 --> 31:41.080
And then we got ac snow paws and I was like that's absolutely adorable. I love it

31:41.160 --> 31:46.600
It's easy to remember like I know some people are dogging on the names like I'm sorry

31:46.680 --> 31:53.560
But we're an english-speaking agency. I don't see the point of having like yuku solavia and a surname

31:54.040 --> 31:58.040
Like in japanese, I just I'm like i'm not gonna remember it joystick child

31:59.480 --> 32:00.600
Um

32:00.600 --> 32:03.640
Me I was pretty quick. I knew I was going to be strongy off the bat

32:03.800 --> 32:06.520
I knew I was going to name myself after my dad's gamer tag strontium

32:06.840 --> 32:11.080
It's not his actual gamer tag before anyone worries that like his literal thing. Don't worry

32:11.160 --> 32:14.280
I was always going to be strongy, but it was like I don't know where 365

32:14.360 --> 32:20.920
I actually don't remember 365 at all. Don't remember a spiral swirl notice the check mark against swirl

32:20.920 --> 32:23.800
That's because I approved it and then you know, I was a cut official

32:23.800 --> 32:26.120
I was like, you know what strongy calls locket and boys

32:26.680 --> 32:31.320
And then she be because of her shabari rope. She was always going to be she be like she be

32:32.360 --> 32:33.720
um

32:33.720 --> 32:36.520
And then we really liked cotton, but obviously there's a

32:37.080 --> 32:41.400
You know cotton tails of a va. So we didn't want to step on anyone's tail. You know I'm shining

32:42.760 --> 32:44.600
and

32:44.600 --> 32:50.200
So we got cotton bud and then we got cotton maw, but that didn't work and then we got cotton bum

32:51.320 --> 32:56.120
And then we're like that makes perfect sense because she has a tail if you didn't know three members avail or have a tail

32:57.000 --> 33:01.880
She's a distant relative. Yeah, honestly, it's fine. We were not wanting to step on anyone name wise

33:02.600 --> 33:05.880
But yeah, as I said, emmy is not here because emmy's name got nailed off the bat

33:05.880 --> 33:11.400
I don't care what anyone says. I have never named someone more perfect than emmy, but I promise you I'm not naming anyone else after this because

33:12.360 --> 33:13.240
I

33:13.240 --> 33:15.640
People are kind of like, oh why why the french route?

33:16.120 --> 33:17.080
um

33:17.080 --> 33:22.040
I don't know. I think it's pretty easy to remember everyone's name like that clap along with me chat

33:22.680 --> 33:24.120
emmy

33:24.120 --> 33:25.720
ac

33:25.720 --> 33:27.160
she be

33:27.160 --> 33:28.760
strongy

33:28.760 --> 33:30.280
merci

33:30.280 --> 33:32.280
Azara

33:32.360 --> 33:37.320
Like these names are not hard to freaking remember in my opinion. Okay

33:39.160 --> 33:41.160
Yeah, um

33:41.800 --> 33:45.480
Okay, this is just about a feedback if anyone reaches out to the emails

33:46.280 --> 33:52.120
The dev team get back to me a lot. Um, if you are applying to be an editor, some people do still submit it

33:52.120 --> 33:54.760
We're always kind of looking for clippers editors so you can submit yourself

33:55.640 --> 34:00.360
If you apply and be like, hey, I want to be an editor right?

34:00.920 --> 34:09.960
And you don't attach a portfolio or any evidence history of editing or a youtube where you've done like a playlist of edits

34:10.920 --> 34:14.440
Bro, we're not gonna reply. You're wasting your time

34:15.400 --> 34:17.480
You need apply. Yeah, do not apply with

34:18.920 --> 34:23.800
Fondle is crazy. Right, right. I know it was a bad name. Okay. Let me let me care. Um

34:25.320 --> 34:31.720
We've had some music creators reach out. That's fantastic that do original songs. So for the vealor members that want to pursue

34:32.360 --> 34:38.680
Um singing, uh, there might be original songs coming out. There's a few song covers. I'm gonna try and I think she

34:38.680 --> 34:44.280
Has an interest. I'm gonna try and poke a zura to do some song covers or maybe some lullabies because her voice is just

34:45.160 --> 34:47.160
for it and

34:47.320 --> 34:53.480
Uh, hot to the cleavage right enough to uh, I tried my best but a zura was hard to name but come on a zura duly

34:54.120 --> 34:55.560
literally, uh

34:55.560 --> 34:57.560
goddess of milk if you will

34:58.360 --> 34:59.880
um

35:00.600 --> 35:03.240
This is the most embarrassing part

35:03.960 --> 35:11.480
The first name a concept for the agency was V sucky and now we are all succubus

35:15.240 --> 35:19.400
And the motto would you survive if you met one of us?

35:22.280 --> 35:28.440
Like so the concept was like succubus blood was like seeping into these girls somehow

35:29.480 --> 35:31.480
because I don't like when

35:32.200 --> 35:38.120
Vtuber stories like all connect like me and Icy would never meet because I'm in the water and she's on land type thing

35:38.120 --> 35:41.880
Like I don't like when agencies like force the lore to come together

35:42.600 --> 35:44.600
So a concept of that and I was like

35:45.720 --> 35:51.880
No, we're not so before anyone makes fun of vealor vealor terrible name

35:52.200 --> 35:56.440
We could have been v sucky. Okay as in short for virtual succubus

35:57.000 --> 36:01.080
So, uh, I will not be taking any statements and things. Okay

36:01.880 --> 36:03.880
You're all done. Okay

36:04.120 --> 36:08.520
This is just a fun behind-the-scenes special shout out to yumi yumi works

36:08.920 --> 36:12.120
They are magnificent and made all over loading screens

36:12.840 --> 36:18.120
As you can see these are just the concepts, but they're still stunning and it's nice to see behind-the-scenes stuff, but um

36:19.480 --> 36:22.920
Mercy's was influenced by the joker

36:23.720 --> 36:30.840
Being surrounded by knives in the batman scene unironically acy if you didn't catch acy's

36:31.800 --> 36:32.920
um

36:32.920 --> 36:36.840
loading screen is a bit mella melancholy melancholy

36:37.320 --> 36:38.840
um

36:38.840 --> 36:40.040
where

36:40.040 --> 36:41.240
the

36:41.240 --> 36:42.280
A

36:42.280 --> 36:45.800
The borealis that comes up lights up her thingy

36:45.880 --> 36:50.360
But hers is a bit more sad because she's just left her polar bear family

36:51.320 --> 36:53.160
melancholic

36:53.160 --> 36:55.480
Isn't colic when babies are crying

36:56.440 --> 37:03.560
Aurora borealis I always want to say ariola borealis and I'm pretty sure that means a nip, but I'm trying. I'm trying, bro

37:04.200 --> 37:06.200
Uh, she be nailed off the bat

37:06.280 --> 37:10.920
Um, I wanted everyone's mascot to be a part of the loading screen because I just find that stuff adorable

37:11.000 --> 37:17.320
And yes, viola did premake all the mascots. Uh, emmy uh elected to change hers. Absolutely fine. No problems

37:17.800 --> 37:23.240
Like we're not a dictating agency. The girls can come to me and be like, I didn't like that. I want something else. Yeah, that's fine. Um

37:24.200 --> 37:28.760
Uh, Azura, you'll notice did get a new scene that she used on debut

37:29.560 --> 37:31.720
um

37:31.720 --> 37:36.200
But yeah, this is just behind the scenes kind of this is the oh my god, it's dempa fish

37:36.600 --> 37:42.840
Surprise, you know how on debut I was like, I have ASMR clubs planned with other vtubers. Yeah, so a dempa fish is one of them

37:44.200 --> 37:45.880
um

37:45.880 --> 37:51.640
But yes, this is just kind of behind the scenes aren't just to see how it comes together. No, right. Okay. Okay, this next bit

37:51.880 --> 38:00.200
So everyone likes the designs. Yeah, all the designs are 10 out of 10, aren't they? Oh, we just love the design

38:00.280 --> 38:02.280
We did not

38:07.240 --> 38:10.040
We did not look like how we look no

38:10.840 --> 38:12.520
Okay

38:12.520 --> 38:14.760
We do not look like how we look no

38:16.840 --> 38:18.360
Yeah

38:18.360 --> 38:19.640
Yikes

38:19.720 --> 38:21.720
Now Emi and Azura

38:22.120 --> 38:27.640
Emi and Azura. Yeah, uh, I just yeah, so as you can see I see it's an even in the lineup

38:29.160 --> 38:30.840
Yet five is me

38:30.840 --> 38:33.320
Uh, I always had bunch double bunches in my hair

38:33.320 --> 38:39.480
So I have two bunches in my hair like the seashells are just accessories, but there's actually two bubbles. But yeah

38:40.440 --> 38:42.440
Sheebie was also

38:42.760 --> 38:44.760
the heck

38:44.760 --> 38:46.760
with uh triple C's

38:47.480 --> 38:53.800
Uh, Azura and thingy, but then you know things changed. So then the next lineup we're like, right change it

38:54.680 --> 38:57.320
Next lineup aces with us. Let's go

38:58.520 --> 39:00.520
um

39:01.080 --> 39:02.280
Uh

39:02.280 --> 39:05.720
Mercy's hair has changed so she no longer has drills

39:07.480 --> 39:12.040
Uh, I've changed a bit. I've got like these weird spirals in my hair, but I quite like that. It's quite unique

39:12.920 --> 39:14.920
Sheebie is still purple

39:15.800 --> 39:20.760
We're changing you but we do have ac developed. Okay. We have ac developed now. Okay change again

39:21.560 --> 39:23.560
All right, body type change on sheebie

39:23.960 --> 39:26.600
Strone complete change on strone

39:27.320 --> 39:29.720
Mercy again still the wrong hair color

39:32.760 --> 39:40.760
And then next okay, let's try again and as you can see hates were established and names were established

39:41.320 --> 39:45.560
My height got changed. Sheebie's got changed. Azura became taller because

39:46.120 --> 39:49.800
We made her a giant test. If you didn't know Azura can

39:50.920 --> 39:56.280
Be as tall as a skyscraper. Now, there's not an indefinite height, but yeah

39:57.400 --> 39:58.280
um

39:58.280 --> 40:00.280
Mercy's coming out with a

40:00.520 --> 40:09.000
Short very shortly about her being blonde. You'll like it. Um, and then here we go big changes on me and sheebie at the same time

40:10.840 --> 40:11.720
so

40:11.720 --> 40:13.720
Sheebie got her hair spirals

40:14.360 --> 40:15.880
Um her ears

40:15.880 --> 40:21.000
Concepted and then I started to come to life. Um, as you can see I have little shoesies on

40:21.560 --> 40:23.560
The shoesies got taken away

40:23.640 --> 40:25.080
Why am I in a different style?

40:25.080 --> 40:31.000
Well, I had to go a different concept artist because we were struggling at the time. Um, and then eventually

40:31.320 --> 40:32.680
ac was getting developed

40:32.680 --> 40:37.800
So this that was her first development footage of her model that kind of transition you see there

40:38.200 --> 40:40.200
As you see Mercy's hair is still wrong

40:40.840 --> 40:44.680
They took your kicks. I know they yanked my shoes. Give me them back

40:46.280 --> 40:49.480
Actually, oh my god, I should be like, uh, right there we go. So

40:50.600 --> 40:52.600
We're going to take it from the top

40:53.560 --> 41:00.040
The first girl developed. Uh, what am I doing for time? Oh, I'm actually not doing bad for time. Let's go school

41:01.960 --> 41:03.720
Um

41:03.720 --> 41:06.920
I was good. I was good. Uh, right. We're going to take it from this top

41:07.800 --> 41:11.640
Emmy was the first conceptualized veiler

41:12.840 --> 41:14.600
girl, okay

41:14.600 --> 41:20.360
But she ain't look like that the star boom. Oh wait wrong one wrong one. Hold on. Hold on out. Wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

41:20.920 --> 41:23.800
Hold on. Don't don't like don't like no. No, no, right. There we go. Boom

41:24.520 --> 41:26.520
This is the first

41:26.840 --> 41:29.560
official concept of emmy

41:31.640 --> 41:34.840
Yeah, that's what emmy emmy looks like at the start

41:35.800 --> 41:39.080
Mm-hmm. You can kind of see it that she's got the sneakers

41:39.800 --> 41:43.480
She's got the uh, the hoodie uh, the hair is orange

41:44.200 --> 41:47.560
but uh, it's giving it's giving best

41:48.680 --> 41:51.320
Frendo next door. It's not giving emmy isn't

41:52.040 --> 41:54.040
Frankie. Oh, honestly. Yeah

41:54.200 --> 41:56.840
I said squish her down make her a wee one

41:57.720 --> 41:59.720
So then we got her squished down

42:00.040 --> 42:07.800
Uh, we're starting to get uh, definitely getting her silhouette going on but no pins. We do have her uh, how you call them?

42:08.280 --> 42:09.160
Uh

42:09.160 --> 42:13.880
Pumpkins in her hair have been established at this point. Yeah, she got hydraulic pressed

42:14.680 --> 42:19.400
Uh, and then we're like and back to the drawing board. Go next

42:19.960 --> 42:25.800
It was like hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. We're cooking. We are cooking by gas, okay

42:26.520 --> 42:31.240
So we were getting very close as you can see by this design very very close in the concept art

42:31.800 --> 42:33.800
So then we gave her the old

42:33.960 --> 42:40.280
Overwatch skin if you don't know overwatch sell skins by recoloring them. She got recolored

42:41.320 --> 42:46.360
Uh, there we go. That was it. That was it. Boom recolored and just like that. There's emmy. That's emmy

42:47.560 --> 42:48.920
There's emmy

42:48.920 --> 42:50.920
There she is

42:51.480 --> 42:54.680
So gave her the old overwatch skin color change and boom

42:55.560 --> 42:57.320
Ta-da

42:57.320 --> 43:03.240
Uh, and then there is some behind scenes uh banner. This commission wasn't able to be finished. Um

43:04.200 --> 43:08.040
But I thought to show it off anyway. This is by papa perito

43:08.840 --> 43:11.000
Incredibly good artist sadly ran out of time

43:11.640 --> 43:13.640
due to life constraints. However

43:14.680 --> 43:20.200
I know you won't be able to tell but this was originally going to be your banner and it's actually a skyroom reference

43:20.440 --> 43:26.360
Sweet mother sweet mother send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear

43:26.360 --> 43:31.000
It is the sacrament done to summon the night mother satans

43:32.360 --> 43:36.200
Uh, that was her reference for the banner. Okay up next

43:37.160 --> 43:40.200
Azura or should I say stacey milkerton?

43:41.240 --> 43:46.440
Uh, here we go. Boom. Okay. So that was her name hearty hearty heart. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm bad at naming

43:46.920 --> 43:52.040
So this was her banner concept that ended up becoming her loading screen

43:53.160 --> 43:57.320
This is our banner concept. It didn't get finished, but this is now her new loading

43:58.120 --> 44:00.120
Fondle of bosom

44:02.840 --> 44:04.840
So

44:04.840 --> 44:07.480
Development on azura was so simple

44:08.120 --> 44:11.400
It was easy peasy lemon sco easy

44:12.040 --> 44:17.560
We had thick goddess straight from the bat. We knew we wanted her thick. We had horns

44:18.200 --> 44:21.720
Uh concept art said fantastic because this is what we got next

44:23.240 --> 44:31.000
Boom, she's already there. You know what's different, but look at this azura azura was nailed off the bat the most simplest

44:31.640 --> 44:33.480
easiest

44:33.480 --> 44:39.960
Design honestly, so as you can see she's pretty much there. So as we progress right something's not right with the legs, right?

44:40.680 --> 44:46.280
Okay, boom. We've now got stirrup thigh highs. You are welcome

44:47.320 --> 44:49.480
chocolate stirrup thigh high

44:51.560 --> 44:53.560
Words and stuff

44:55.000 --> 44:58.040
Okay, right. Right. Right. What's what's missing? Hold on. What's missing?

44:58.760 --> 45:00.760
Something's not quite finished with her

45:00.840 --> 45:08.600
Markings. Yes, that makes sense. She's a goddess add them markings. So nose arm thigh add them markings. Okay. Okay. We're cooking

45:08.920 --> 45:10.920
We're cooking

45:10.920 --> 45:12.520
We're cooking

45:12.520 --> 45:16.360
And then oh, what was that? Did you see that? Did you see that change on the thigh? Boom

45:17.080 --> 45:20.520
Little little thigh things going on beautiful beautiful gorgeous

45:21.400 --> 45:23.400
And then next next next what's next?

45:23.560 --> 45:28.920
Uh, I think that's actually an older one there and I was just thinking that and then boom

45:29.560 --> 45:33.240
She got her toe rings added. Let's go toe rings

45:35.640 --> 45:37.720
And now we have azura there we go

45:39.240 --> 45:41.240
I was going to be a milk god

45:42.920 --> 45:46.280
Nate it should very should very simplistic very easy very quick

45:47.160 --> 45:49.160
Uh, right

45:49.400 --> 45:51.880
Please hold on to your hats

45:52.680 --> 45:54.680
Because I present to you

45:55.240 --> 45:57.240
AC

45:57.560 --> 45:59.560
No, not that

45:59.880 --> 46:01.720
That's that's ac

46:02.520 --> 46:03.880
Uh

46:03.880 --> 46:05.880
Yeah, that was ac

46:06.920 --> 46:08.440
um

46:08.520 --> 46:10.520
Enjoy

46:13.800 --> 46:15.560
Okay

46:15.560 --> 46:20.440
AC was conceptualized to be an insomniatic gamer. Okay

46:22.120 --> 46:27.960
We kept the insomniatic vibes because if you didn't know polar bears do not hibernate

46:28.680 --> 46:30.680
Unless they're pregnant. So

46:31.480 --> 46:35.480
If see y'all better you better jump off my daughter right now. Okay

46:36.440 --> 46:38.440
She she doesn't need to hibernate

46:39.160 --> 46:47.560
However, please I would like to draw your attention to the paws. See those neon blue paws. They were supposed to follow her around

46:48.520 --> 46:50.520
Polar bear paws

46:50.680 --> 46:56.360
Oh, okay. So we took it from there. We took it from there. Yeah, that's actually that's where we started

46:56.440 --> 47:00.600
And then we got the polar bear paws added in these antenna things and it just

47:01.560 --> 47:06.040
Was me looking me was me was me congealing and then look at that

47:06.120 --> 47:10.840
Look at the pillow the belly button. Please analyze the belly button for me because there's a lot of polar bear

47:11.400 --> 47:13.400
piercing on her stomach

47:14.360 --> 47:18.200
Uh, yeah, originally she was to have a wee person and uh

47:19.320 --> 47:25.800
Both the concept artist and I were like look it's not working out. We're gonna need to be we're gonna need

47:26.120 --> 47:28.120
We're gonna need you to cook so whoa

47:29.080 --> 47:31.080
We're changing it up. So acie

47:32.360 --> 47:36.760
Had little little braids little tribal braids and she's freaking adorable

47:37.160 --> 47:40.840
And the top of her shirt's all ripped up. But she has like big baggy sleeves

47:41.400 --> 47:46.040
Getting very cute. It does look a bit sleep whereas, but she had a little piercing as well here a little tummy pierce

47:47.080 --> 47:49.720
Um, we're getting a bit closer to acie. We know today

47:49.720 --> 47:51.720
Hmm

47:51.960 --> 47:55.960
And then okay, we got another design. We've taken away the long sleeve. So

47:57.560 --> 48:01.560
We're not quite there yet. We're not quite there yet. Hold on. Hold on. Okay, okay

48:01.560 --> 48:07.480
We're getting a bit more primal now. Look at the gloves gloves glove check glove check. Okay. Gloves are on check

48:08.360 --> 48:12.760
Well, they wear gloves at the start but then they became paws

48:13.240 --> 48:18.920
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So we had a little comparison and then whoa, hold on hold on

48:19.480 --> 48:23.400
We have paws established. We have an ace

48:24.040 --> 48:26.280
tight design established

48:27.080 --> 48:29.080
very bare-esk

48:29.080 --> 48:30.360
And then

48:30.360 --> 48:35.880
Yeah, we we got we got there. So she has her insomniatic eyes on she has a toggle for insomniatic eyes

48:36.280 --> 48:39.720
But she's insomniatic but take a little look at her feet. They're so different

48:40.680 --> 48:42.680
She had open toe boots

48:42.680 --> 48:44.680
She had her little toes out

48:44.680 --> 48:47.640
But you can see she definitely has claws at this part of development

48:47.640 --> 48:50.520
But she has scars all over her ripped clothing that kind of thing

48:51.960 --> 48:58.360
Um, and if you really want to zoom in she actually has a tiny tiny cleavage line because she has a little something there

48:58.920 --> 49:00.920
Uh, emi is true petam

49:01.320 --> 49:05.240
But acie uh has just uh just a little hint of something, you know

49:05.880 --> 49:07.800
Uh, oh, uh, this shouldn't be in the middle of it

49:07.800 --> 49:12.440
But this was her banner concept because she's a little insomniac

49:13.080 --> 49:16.040
Okay, she's a little insomniac. She's so tired

49:16.680 --> 49:20.520
She's up at 3am. So this was her banner, but it didn't get finished

49:20.920 --> 49:26.840
Due to time constraints, absolutely no fault of papaparito at all. He was fantastic. That's a very adorable banner

49:27.560 --> 49:32.120
Um, yeah, as I said the name concepts and then this was her first model

49:32.280 --> 49:38.200
Uh, draft not model. Sorry like the the the the draft of the model

49:39.080 --> 49:43.720
And we were like, oh, was it no that what that was the first draft and we're like

49:45.800 --> 49:52.360
Get those thighs thicker and squish her please and then we squished her down got nice and squished

49:53.400 --> 49:55.400
Um, and then there's acie

49:56.280 --> 49:59.400
Uh, uh, yeah, there she is

49:59.800 --> 50:04.680
That's acie cool. Uh, she was definitely a bit more difficult in development just because we

50:05.400 --> 50:12.840
I gave the wrong prompts to the concept artist. So that's on me. So she took a wee bit longer to get there

50:14.360 --> 50:16.360
Uh for mercy

50:16.920 --> 50:21.320
Uh, please remember her code name was karam. I may accidentally refer to her as karam

50:21.400 --> 50:25.640
I've called her karam for an entire year. Please understand. Please forgive. Okay

50:26.680 --> 50:28.920
Uh, this was a banner that was supposed to be

50:30.200 --> 50:32.200
for mercy

50:32.200 --> 50:37.000
Um, it was going to be darkened out and shadowed a lot more but obviously there was a bit insidiousness

50:37.720 --> 50:39.720
and in background and

50:41.720 --> 50:45.400
Uh going on but yes, so originally

50:46.360 --> 50:49.400
I originally mercy had twin tails

50:50.120 --> 50:51.560
or drills

50:51.560 --> 50:53.880
Kind of looking thing going on

50:55.000 --> 51:02.360
Um, but she always had her bow her stomach wasn't showing actually just her mid drift. I believe it's a terminology for that

51:02.760 --> 51:05.480
Um, I stole her wig honestly

51:06.120 --> 51:13.720
Um, but yeah, uh, we definitely were really close to mercy right from the start, but she was blonde

51:14.680 --> 51:17.400
Well, would it well a blonde? I know

51:18.760 --> 51:25.320
Um, and then we showed her stomach and it was like, okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

51:26.120 --> 51:31.560
And then we got blonde and alterations in comparison

51:32.440 --> 51:35.560
But now obviously you've seen that purple

51:36.280 --> 51:39.480
So she's purple. You know what I'm saying out here is purple

51:40.120 --> 51:43.160
Uh, but now that I see blonde mercy

51:43.240 --> 51:47.640
It does not like it looks wrong to me because it's like that's not how it should be looking

51:49.080 --> 51:52.280
Um, and then we got purple eyes

51:53.080 --> 51:55.080
Here we're the purple beam right now

51:55.720 --> 52:03.080
And then boom we got her mercy starts. I've not called her karambi accident in so long

52:03.880 --> 52:05.240
Uh

52:05.240 --> 52:10.600
But yeah, there you go. Uh, she was relatively there. She was there from the start. Honestly, uh, not too much of a

52:11.400 --> 52:13.640
Issue, you know, you can see the comparison. Um

52:14.520 --> 52:15.800
She be

52:15.800 --> 52:19.240
She be I'm sorry to expose you like this

52:22.040 --> 52:24.520
This is the first sign of she be

52:25.400 --> 52:33.480
I'm sorry. Okay. We thought of a rabbit with her ears up. Okay. We're sorry. I'm sorry. Okay

52:34.440 --> 52:38.200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, so

52:39.240 --> 52:44.600
You were supposed to have mercy. No, not fondle of booze. I'm the she be cotton boom

52:46.840 --> 52:52.920
Okay, we didn't go with the design before anyone said we didn't go with the design relax

52:53.640 --> 52:55.640
Who said FNAF Bonnie?

52:57.160 --> 52:58.840
That's awful

52:58.840 --> 53:04.680
Don't speak for the rest of the stream. We didn't go for the design. So

53:06.920 --> 53:11.720
Um, Azura was already established to be purple at this point. So

53:13.000 --> 53:17.080
We were changing the body tape and then the body tape got changed

53:17.160 --> 53:22.600
So she became like the stereotypical milk body type of the boobanda hips

53:23.320 --> 53:26.520
Um, and then but we're still purple and we were having

53:27.480 --> 53:32.760
I'll be honest. This was getting really frustration frustration. Lovely. This is getting really

53:33.320 --> 53:39.960
Frustrating at this point in development. She be we had been cooking for a bit and we were really struggling like but then

53:41.560 --> 53:43.560
We had I don't think these are in order

53:44.600 --> 53:46.600
No, they're not. Oh well. Hey, ho

53:46.920 --> 53:47.960
So

53:47.960 --> 53:51.880
We were having color palette issues. I like the outfit. I liked everything about it

53:51.880 --> 53:54.840
But the hair the color palette was just not working

53:55.160 --> 54:02.680
So I went to a concept artist to very quickly give me a different pose and we went with two hairstyles. Let's say give me this hairstyle

54:03.720 --> 54:08.200
Uh, she looks like a fucking giraffe. So, no, we didn't go with a body ponytail

54:08.280 --> 54:10.280
She looks like some sort of horse a chivalre

54:10.840 --> 54:15.000
Like unparred like I didn't want a horse vtuber if you want a horse vtuber

54:15.480 --> 54:18.920
We ain't the agency for you because I'm not interested in horse girls

54:19.560 --> 54:25.080
Okay, but we got the drills and if you didn't know shebe's drills actually get more red at the bottom

54:25.560 --> 54:27.960
It's a very small detail very small detail

54:28.520 --> 54:34.600
Come ride this pony. Honestly. Oh, that's why you've got a riding crop. You're a secret horse vtuber all along shebe

54:34.600 --> 54:36.600
I can't believe I've got you in 4k

54:37.160 --> 54:39.160
but yeah, um

54:39.240 --> 54:41.240
as you can see the

54:42.040 --> 54:45.880
Little bit gear. Um, it was always a part like the anklet the

54:46.600 --> 54:49.000
Hand cuffs were always going to be a part of her design

54:49.720 --> 54:56.280
And then we got our first model back and we were like, uh, excuse me. Where's the thickness?

54:56.680 --> 55:03.080
Like give us something like this and then you know came along and then hey, oh, it's so easy

55:04.120 --> 55:06.120
It's not the main focus

55:06.600 --> 55:08.120
Not the main focus

55:08.120 --> 55:10.680
Okay, this was her banner concept

55:11.160 --> 55:14.440
Uh, again banner concept my legs are long

55:15.320 --> 55:21.080
These are your banner concepts, but uh, unfortunately didn't make it to finalize production, but this was to be the banner

55:21.320 --> 55:24.840
It's probably a bit too much now that i'm looking at it a bit a bit too a bit too

55:24.920 --> 55:27.480
Spacey a bit too spacey for you

55:28.040 --> 55:30.040
I see it

55:30.360 --> 55:31.560
right

55:31.560 --> 55:33.560
my tone

55:33.720 --> 55:35.720
womp womp

55:35.880 --> 55:38.520
Womp womp there's straw name

55:38.520 --> 55:49.640
There we are. That's me at the start of development. Do you like it? What do you think?

55:51.000 --> 55:53.240
Is it good? Is it peak quick?

55:54.200 --> 55:57.880
I'm going to very quickly go get a cool look as my voice is dying. Give me one second

55:58.440 --> 56:02.840
I know streamers are supposed to be open. Oh, I don't know if you heard me

56:08.680 --> 56:19.640
I don't need to point in mutant because i'm literally going in the kitchen now i'm back in the room and the truck is working again

56:20.120 --> 56:23.640
I stubbed my toe when I left the room that actually really hurt

56:24.920 --> 56:26.200
okay

56:26.200 --> 56:27.720
So yeah, uh

56:27.720 --> 56:33.560
My development was different because I was allowed to dictate my design. Okay, so we started with hypnosis

56:34.120 --> 56:40.040
And then I was a little splatoon squiddle fish ms paint looking ass. You don't watch that. You're done. You're done

56:40.600 --> 56:42.600
Okay, so I was a squiddle

56:43.560 --> 56:49.160
And then so this design don't write this design off. I want to develop this further. I love the color scheme

56:49.240 --> 56:51.640
I love the bikini type thing going on

56:52.440 --> 56:55.480
um the only thing that kill oh wait, I need to open my cola

56:56.680 --> 56:58.680
the only thing like

56:59.400 --> 57:04.840
I think this might be an all outfit all hairstyle because I love those like cat ear looking things on me

57:04.840 --> 57:08.360
And I had my little shell on my hair at this point Zelda looking ass

57:09.800 --> 57:14.680
No, don't insult it. I think it's really good. I really like this design

57:14.680 --> 57:16.760
I like the color scheme with the browns and the

57:17.560 --> 57:21.320
Kind of black thing going on. It's good. It's good. You know, let me cook. Let me cook

57:23.560 --> 57:24.920
so

57:24.920 --> 57:29.640
I originally wasn't gonna have any booba basically because um

57:30.120 --> 57:35.720
But then that got changed because I technically have five children with emmy and isi and azura

57:36.440 --> 57:40.760
And mersey and sheevee. So I originally didn't have any chest size

57:40.840 --> 57:45.880
But then we retconned that because technically uh, yeah, uh very big on the dumpy

57:46.840 --> 57:51.880
So I had clocks for hypnosis to hang off. I always had hypnosis from the star and then

57:52.360 --> 57:55.560
Changed the color a bit, but then I look like an xbox

57:58.520 --> 58:00.520
And then

58:00.600 --> 58:02.520
it's

58:02.520 --> 58:07.400
But that wasn't this shouldn't be here. We're still a bit too early because uh

58:08.280 --> 58:12.600
There's one more design that we didn't finish off. This is Celtic me

58:13.720 --> 58:18.600
um, I definitely am getting an alternative outfit of Celtic me because

58:19.480 --> 58:24.040
I know it might be hard to tell with the accent and all but I'm just a wee bit scottish

58:24.360 --> 58:30.280
But I try and annunciate and make sure you guys can understand me. So yeah, I don't talk the way like

58:31.000 --> 58:36.200
I'm an accent, but I'm definitely getting this developed further the hair. Uh, I like big hair

58:36.280 --> 58:41.320
So I'm probably not gonna keep that hairstyle going on, but I had like a little ears going on little squiddled ears

58:42.760 --> 58:46.040
Um, but that got developed a bit more this honestly looks kind of a bit

58:46.440 --> 58:52.280
Renny's Renny thorns, but if you look at that, this is like very Celtic origin and like little symbolism and that that

58:52.680 --> 58:57.880
Definitely gonna develop this because uh, it's good, but it wasn't what I wanted the

58:59.400 --> 59:02.360
The default to be the default that's the word. Um

59:03.480 --> 59:11.640
Yeah, I got a thingy my hair probably changed that. Oh, I got that foreign to the Celtic design. Oh my god. I completely forgot

59:12.600 --> 59:16.440
Well, there's my Celtic. There's my next outfit boys. Uh

59:18.120 --> 59:21.080
But yeah, very very squiddled very Celtic here. Um

59:22.840 --> 59:24.840
Yeah, uh

59:26.840 --> 59:28.840
Yes, um

59:28.840 --> 59:34.760
I was presented with my squiddled eyes here and I actually have a bikini toggle

59:34.920 --> 59:38.520
Obviously, I'm not gonna do it right now because now's not the time for it

59:38.840 --> 59:43.880
But I have a pair less and I have tape over me, but you see like I technically have tape over my

59:45.160 --> 59:47.880
Bits, you know bits if I go back a few

59:48.920 --> 59:56.120
Um, yeah, I did I really like this Celtic warrior one because I can just I'll just talk about the battle of bannock burn all the time

59:57.080 --> 01:00:01.080
Why not? But yeah, you can definitely see me starting to come to life here

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:07.880
Uh, like the shell of my hair. I did have two bunches, but they weren't as big like I have really big bunches

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.840
um

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:17.720
Got like and then my eyes so my default eyes were going to be swirls, but then I got my squiddled eyes

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.560
Because I'm a cuttlefish. I'm a cephalopod

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.800
Yeah, and then I finally came to there's me

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.480
Ta-da

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.480
It's a me

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:38.920
Uh, and then of course finished models, okay, I'll tell you some hidden things

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:46.040
I'm going to tell you some hidden things now. This is this is what agencies kind of have to deal with behind the scenes

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:53.080
Azura was conceptualized black. Okay a chocolate to be tuber if you will, okay

01:00:54.280 --> 01:01:01.000
However, I came to the horrible realization. I can't put a white girl on Azura

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:10.120
Oh my fucking god. So Azura in development was made racially ambiguous. Now, I apologize for such terminology

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.920
But that's just how it is. That's how the facts are

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:19.560
So she was made racially ambiguous if you look back in some of the promotional models and artwork

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:27.400
She'll notice how pale she was. That's because we had to make her ambiguous. Okay, then Azura came aboard and I was like

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.120
Choclifier right now

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.280
Like get on it

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.840
So, yes, her finalized looks the zoom in a little bit on the finalized model

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.280
Just to highlight a few things that are going on with her beautiful design. So if you didn't know very quickly

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.920
Azura's your mummy quite literally lower wise. She's your mama. She is the goddess of fertility on planet earth

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.440
You heard that right, but she didn't want to go to the heavens with her family

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.920
She wanted to stay among the humans

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:04.440
So she has retained some of her powers as a god

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.480
Okay

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.800
So she has the power of flight, believe it or not. So she's gonna fly on my deck

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.000
Um, I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. Uh

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.640
She also has healing properties

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.600
with her

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.080
milk

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.120
Um, yeah, uh, she can also be a giantess as tall as a skyscraper

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:35.000
These markings are made from when she founded civilization. She has painted nails painted toes

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.480
She has toe rings on her index toes

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.080
a little veil over her thigh highs

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:49.960
Vail in the head or just hips for days like definitely kind of the the birthing hips because she birthed humanity

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.680
like that's the kind of thing going on so

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.320
Yeah

01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.440
Definitely her design was absolutely gorgeous. Um, we had quite a lot of issues

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.680
I ordered the girls quite a few fan arts once we had the designs finalized

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.560
There was a lot of issues with artists not understanding the white

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:16.280
Is her goat ears and they were drawing her like the star wars characters. You know those characters that have the

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.720
Like the thing on the front of them

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:24.120
We got a lot of artwork of that and I had to send back and be like, no, she's a goat

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.200
to go

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.520
Uh go a not door like that. Thanks

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:35.960
Um, ace of cool. She's got scars, which is a very unique element to her. She also has a mouth

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:42.040
Fang not a tooth fang a mouth fang. Okay, mouth fang

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.320
She has scars

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.280
Um, she has ripped clothing

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.280
Um, she also has

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.920
Steel toad capped boots. So, you know, she's safe for work

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.080
100% safe for work character. She got them steel toad boots on. Okay

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.720
um

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:06.920
What other attributes she has a tail? Oh, yeah, uh, zura has a tail and I say has a tail. Um

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.560
May oh look at me

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:16.840
Uh, so, uh, if you didn't know I am wearing a yukata as a nod to japanese culture because

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.840
Without japanese culture truly as v-tubers, we would not be here right now. Let's not pretend otherwise. Oh

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.080
I forgot my cover up over my crotch. I am so sorry

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.640
I forgot about that part of my design

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.360
Uh, I literally have

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:45.320
I flushed your twigs. I'm so sorry. I was supposed to have the bandaid on

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.600
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But anyway, I'm in a yukata. Uh, it's pearlescent

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:58.200
So it shimmers as I move my uh shells in my head also are pearlescent and I'm so sorry

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.680
I'm gonna just take a little drink of my cola

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.960
Oops, uh, but yes, I'm in a yukata as a nod to japanese culture. Um

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.840
For my next alternative, I almost likely do a scottish Celtic type origin

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.560
Uh, we can see it. Um

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.680
Uh, squid eyes. Yep. I am a cuttlefish. I have cuttlefish eyeballs

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:30.760
When we released the eye previews people were surprised but for me if v-tubers just have a regular pupil

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.360
I sleep. I'm sorry

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:40.840
But it's like one of the most simplistic things you can design if you give someone a basic pupil as a vtuber

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.160
Eh boring out

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.280
I'm sorry. That's just my opinion

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:53.800
It was one of the first notes that I gave to the concept artists do not give me a regular pupil

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:59.560
I will perish again same with like fingernail designs, etc. I have french tip

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:07.240
Manicure pedicure the girls all have painted nails. Merci also has band aids on her fingers, for example

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.840
um

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.960
These small things like add up definitely. Um

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:17.320
Yeah, like I this is just my opinion, but I think the

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:23.320
There's nothing to if a design gets too complex on a vtuber

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:28.280
This is just my opinion as well. My opinion just don't do not fucking represent the company as a whole

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.280
It's just me being

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.680
But um

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.160
Like if the designs get too complicated, like I don't know

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.440
I can't remember what the fucking things call but like, you know, there's japanese

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:44.360
Idol skirts where there's like three different meshes and layers and designs and patterns going on

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.480
I'm like, if you start getting too thingy, you're getting nay fan art

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:53.080
No one's going to recognize you because you're xyz like i'm sorry, but you cannae tell me that our designs look

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:58.600
Anything remotely similar to clutter. That's the word cluttered if the designs are too cluttered

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:04.120
Uh, please think of the fan art literally like I'd say mercy is the most

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.680
She doesn't have a cover up. We'll enjoy mercy from here

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:18.040
Uh, mercy is probably the most complex design we have if you want to think of it as layers in terms of fishnet and bandages and

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.200
All that jazz, yeah

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.840
Got strike the balance between not being too over complicated that okay, finally one model that control the full design of

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.840
uh

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:36.120
So if you didn't know she be her hair drills get redder the more bottom you go

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:41.000
That's not even a full english sentence. Um, if you didn't

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.800
No, her thighs got chunked up in development

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:53.560
Uh, we went for the classic leg look look some things are classic and you there's no point

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.840
Don't if it ain't broke don't fix it high heels

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.680
and

01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.880
stockings

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.960
If it ain't broke

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:07.560
Don't fix it. You don't need to do anything special anything unique

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:14.200
Any of that stuff. It's not broke. It's the perfect design. I don't don't even talk to me. Okay

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320
um, so obviously

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.400
My voice is going

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.720
Hold on. Let me take another drink. Um

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.720
Um

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:33.400
I do apologize and say that uh azura and she be you're actually gonna get an update soon to cover up their tattoos. Um

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.360
Because I think youtube are not very happy

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.240
I tried to run ads on them and youtube said no, no, no, no, and I was like

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:46.920
But I have my boobs out as well youtube. So this is just discrimination against big titty girls

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.800
um

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.320
I don't know what else is she be designed was just perfect. Honestly

01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:03.880
A lot of people are like, hey, wait a second. Why is she wearing the bbsm gear if she's supposed to be the dominant one?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
called like I don't know

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.640
Is my response to that like

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.320
Like

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.080
going just

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.440
Going just like

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.760
Enjoy the design. Are you joking me? You look at this design and that and you complain about it

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.680
I'm not a guy. Okay. I didn't have a willy, but if I had a willy, I know for a fact

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.400
This is a 10 out of 10 design. Okay. It's aesthetics

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.040
aesthetic

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.200
Like that's it

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.480
Like like you're done. Didn't he didn't he chat shit about me about these designs?

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.600
Amy, I'm sorry. I had to get you asleep when I was doing this one

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.240
Because I lost your full picture

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.320
somehow

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.320
Amy is adorable

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.560
love her design

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:02.920
She has a rat skull on her necklace and these little gemstones too. She has nails on her thingy

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.480
she's only of a only one in v allure that has a

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.200
Tatoo

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.360
Is it a tattoo or is it a marking because she did something funny with a book?

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.640
Who knows I didn't really develop that part of the lore. So

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.200
You guys can pick it's up to you

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:27.080
A womb tat it lights up. No, it doesn't let it's not with tattoo. Don't you loot my daughter

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:33.640
She also has adorable band-aid and freckles on her knee nose and on her weenie. She got a knee bump. No

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:39.800
No, let me make it better. Oh, wait. Oh wait, you're layered above me. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. I need to make it better

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.880
I'll need to kiss her knee better

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.040
Hold on. Let me cook

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Oh, no

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.040
Oh, my hair's too big right. I need a bald toggle right now

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Yeah, it's all better

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.280
She also has a knife and blood on her sock if you didn't know that was knife and blood on her sock. Yes, um

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.160
look

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:09.080
In terms of like sacrifice and people and stuff it means like a little quirky like that

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:14.040
Okay, like whatever she needs to do to get back and you know get her brother back

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:21.720
And for the papegas out there you viewing are her brother watching her from afar. Okay

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.880
For the papegas. Don't worry. I'm papega too. So right. Where are we?

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.080
Is that everything? No

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.480
Let's go

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:37.400
All the girls descriptions for their newest 2.0's will have merch updates if you didn't know

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.400
All of the

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.800
prophets

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:50.040
Go to the girls veiler. Do not take a cut of the merchandise. We don't put our little fingies in the merchandise

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:55.400
So rest assured if you buy something off uwu market for my buy

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:03.080
All that money goes to support in them a lot of the girls are interested in moving out so they can up their streaming time

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.160
They are trying very hard. I'm trying to support them in any way I possibly can

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.160
and

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.840
Hopefully from what you've seen not even to cover the cost. So

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.560
uwu market

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.160
Will take their cut or whatever their you know earning is and then whatever is left over is profit-wise

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:26.040
Goes straight to the talent. It does not go into vealers like accounts or anything like that

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:33.240
So please seriously rest assured like this isn't some sort of money grab agency when you support your talent

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:39.000
You support your talent like the talent. Okay. You don't have to think to yourself

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:44.120
Oh, if I give a hundred dollars, are they gonna get seven dollars of it? No

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.720
That's not how it works here. It's not called

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.440
Guys don't even take two percent. No the hundred percent march to the girls

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.680
like come on

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.960
What wouldn't you be like in your head?

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.280
Wouldn't you be upset if you learned like oh, I supported

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:08.680
The my oh shi desu with a hundred dollars and they only made like five bucks because of how much the yoink like

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.480
You know what I'm saying? So

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.800
I'm just coming out and saying it 80 20 cut and guess what if the girls stay on another year

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:21.480
It goes to a 15 cut for veal or because the girls do all the work. Actually, that's a really good point

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.560
I might talk about that

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:31.080
Um, oh, this is like oh, oh, I need to do my merch. Hold on. I uh, it's a strong image tentacles tentacle power

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.000
tentacle power

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.120
Um, I am actually gonna get a keychain because I'm so excited. I'm getting all the girls keychains

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.760
No, I'm gonna say something

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.720
And I might filter a few people

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.800
I'm okay with hand cam streams

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.760
I'm gonna make an ASMR video of me like tapping on all the keychains of the girls

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.760
I'm gonna like melise them with my hands

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:59.400
Um, so, you know if you are into the vtuber immersion where you don't see any body parts

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:05.240
I'm very sorry. I'm not the vtuber for you, but there's definitely veal the lure girl out there for you. Just not me

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:09.080
Yeah, I'll be I'm gonna touch all the girls. Okay

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:14.440
Yeah, just my keychain. I really like that. This came out so good. I really like it

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.200
Um, okay, I think we can do the Q&A

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.640
section now

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:30.200
Uh, I am going to link my marshmallow if anyone would like to ask a question in private because I do understand some people

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.520
are a bit adverse

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.520
Are a bit embarrassed

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:38.360
Uh, so ask any agency related questions here

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.960
agent sign

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.160
that's

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.160
Did that even send? Oh

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.080
Oh and my toggles are all coming on because I forgot to unbind them from my keyboard. You know what?

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.920
You know what? If it wasn't a scoff, you wouldn't be enjoying yourself. I will take

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.960
me out of this. Oh my god. I can hear myself twice.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.160
Right, let me pin that message

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.960
Right, let's see

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.520
What are the plans for membership streams versus patreon? Let me take my toggle off first

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:12.680
Um, so if you want to support the girl on patreon, you will get access to four audios. I would like to comment on that

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.720
Um, obviously I had to do a lot of preparing in advance

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:23.640
It's five dollars to support your girl on patreon for four audios

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.840
What we are doing is called undercutting the market

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:33.000
If you didn't know undercutting the market means you put your product quotation marks out

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.720
At a rate that is incredibly cheap in comparison to other va's

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.440
Not only do you get streams from the girls

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.040
Not only do you get alternative content on their all twitter's for free

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.000
But we have undercut the market on patreon as well

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:51.560
So if you would like to test the content that they produce

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.800
on patreon

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.480
I highly recommend

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.480
Supporting them

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:04.200
Over me because I post free stuff all the time. You don't all worry about me. Okay, so support that girl's first

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:09.160
It's called undercutting the market isn't a very nice thing to do, but it's uh

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:18.520
It is what it is now. I did have a few concerns about the type of audios. Please understand and direct any

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.640
Disappointments towards me

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:28.440
Because um, I did not the girls have shown interest some of them to create the scripts and role plays

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:34.040
But please understand. I had to make sure I'm not putting them in a position where they are

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.760
overstressed or overworked

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.440
when it comes to balancing streaming and

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.280
The role plays now I have made them as straightforward and the girls are welcome to talk about their experience on stream

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.560
Behind the scenes, you know as long as not an nda hens

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:59.400
I'm sure they know the difference between like leaking nda content and just being like oh, this is how it works. Okay

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:08.120
Well, let's say five dollars forever. Yes. Um, I uh believe um

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.120
I have no plans to raise the price. I think five dollars. Um

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.440
is

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:23.480
An acceptable price. I'm I'm very aware of the economy the state that the bloody hangs in

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:24.600
Um

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:30.360
And in order to support your oh shi desks that might be in veiler the maximum price you will pay per month

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.040
I believe is nine dollars and ninety nine cent us dollars

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:40.360
For the maximum price of uh, again all content that your oh shi desks produces. Okay

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.600
So

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:48.680
I wanted it to be as affordable as possible and again that 80 20 split goes across the board your

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:53.720
Majority is supporting your talent. It's not getting hogged up to the agency. Okay?

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.720
Um

01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:03.000
What will the main content on the youtube channels be streaming? We are v-tubers. We're just regular v-tubers that offer the goods on the side

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:10.280
But um, please do not think we are trying to speed run banning our youtube channels

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.960
Um, there was a few misconceptions out there that we may

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:20.040
Do outrageous things. Please understand. Uh, I'm trying to help these girls become

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.000
content creators of their dreams help them achieve things that they've always wanted to do

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.640
Hell even get them a play button

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.720
So as much as jorkin der pintis

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:38.600
On youtube would be hilarious content for three seconds. I really don't want them to get banned. So

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:44.040
They're just gonna be my lovely v-tribbon gals. Um

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.320
Yes

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:53.240
We need you on stage at a v-tribbon convention. This is insane market and i'm praying insane market

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.600
What revealing that azur's codename with stacey milker in is insane market

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.960
No, absolutely no

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.080
Absolutely no

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:16.520
Awesome. Oh, yeah, be sucky by the way instead of veal or be sucky. Oh, you've oh, I've got you right there

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.400
Nah, I'm talking the behind. Okay. The behind the scenes stuff is all fun to kind of be like

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:28.040
So obviously you've just met the girls. I have known them for a year if that makes sense

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.840
Like these concepts and everything's been going on for a year. I want some v sucky

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:39.160
Hey, the behind the scenes content was cringe cringe, but peak. Thank you fondle a bosom

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.640
Um

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:50.280
Can't wait to see be sucky at off guy. Oh, we got all right. No, it's not okay before before I say the story

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.440
We got uninvited to a convention

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:57.720
So the girl we got invited to a convention. Uh, we were getting a free pass

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.080
And then the girls not safe for work twitters went live and then nine hours later

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:08.600
We got an email saying oops our convention is full. Uh, we're not interested anymore

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.400
But nine hours prior they were like, yeah, we're still interested. Uh, we can set up a booth

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.640
We can give you free pass to staff members

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.520
And we got uninvited when the girls not safe for work twitters went live

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.760
Oh

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:28.120
So, yeah, we're kind of spend on that but whatever convention

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:31.960
I do have good news that we are going to a convention

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:38.440
In 2025, um, it will be remote. I don't think uh, I can physically show up

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.720
I don't think any of us can for safety or whatever. Although I don't want to

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.320
That's the stream for me. I'll I'll talk about the idea in the stream. Sorry. My voice is getting fried right now. Can you hear it?

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.960
Oh

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:53.720
Um, no, so the the bizarre thing was on our website

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.600
We said from the start we're a bit naughty naughty

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:02.520
And then the email does on the website like we'd love all your talents to come to our agency to our agency to our convention

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.360
I was like, hey, yeah

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.320
And then we really and then we do the thing that we said we were going to do on the website and they were like, oh, sorry

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.320
We're fully booked me. I'm like

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.000
Okay

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.960
Yeah, yeah, that's some fun behind the scenes. I oh don't know the watch alongs

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:24.840
Oh my god, if you are a vtuber that has a management that deals with sponsorships

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.920
You got cucked out of so much money

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.280

They were like nah, we don't want to we don't want to put your audio and video on screen

Thank you from the bottom of my heart because one you weren't greedy shits

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:24.200
And two you actually gave us the time of day. I'm very thankful

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.920
so, yeah

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:35.080
Yeah, vnu thumbs up yumi plus thumbs up a lot of vtuber agencies didn't even respond to emails thumbs down

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.680
Like not even a courtesy email

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:42.760
There's a lot of theories about why we didn't get a response

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:48.200
But uh, I completely get it. I'm just freaking meman by the way before you're like, oh my god

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.000
I hate vtuber agencies. No, it's not how it works

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:57.480
um, but um off kai clashed with a lot of things I think I offered like 10,000

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:02.840
Oh, that was it. I think I offered a 8,000 to someone and never got response

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:08.760
But uh, I'm telling you right now if you have a manager that is a barrier between someone saying to you

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:13.240
Hey, I want to sponsor you. Yeah, you got wrecked because there was I think

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.280
We sent 40 managements

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.440
emails out with the offer inside

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.080
and

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.760
like no response

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:31.720
Crickets and the fact that the 12k one was hilarious because the original offer was 10k

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.440
and then they were like

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:40.840
Actually this feature were just 4,000 per hour. So I was like right fine raise our offer to 12k

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:46.680
And then we told her like little thing. We're like, yeah, just react to the girls have a audio and and they were like

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:52.600
We actually recommend not having the video and audio on so more people go into the streams

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.280
I was like

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:57.000
Mate, we're paying you 12,000 us dollars

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:04.360
And you're you're not gonna do like what we kindly ask which is be a react Andy Andy for three hours like it was

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.720
I was crazy. I cannot tell you what goes on behind the scenes. Absolutely crazy crazy crazy

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:19.400
But anyway, sorry, I was taking a drink of cola when oh all our models have a sleep. Are you ready for my sleep?

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.040
I do hypnosis when I sleep

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:33.720
Uh, would you kindly be a react and do yeah, so anyway thumbs up to everyone who did end up doing a watch long

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:36.200
I apologize to anyone

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.640
um

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.360
Who submitted themselves and your price was too high

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.440
I didn't even

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:47.240
Bother to haggle if your price was too high because I was like mate some

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:54.680
Um, I don't want to be mean but some of you had very interesting price points

01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:01.880
Someone was like what's your average viewership 20 views and they asked for uh

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:09.320
I think it was 700 us dollars and I'm like that's that's not how it works. But thank you for your submitting yourself

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.200
I appreciate it

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:20.120
Uh, but yeah, and also I am so sorry if you applied uh under the veal or googled thingy

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:24.200
And you said you would be you would do it for free anyway

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.600
I'm sorry, but I didn't reply because you said you'd do it for free

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.080
So

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.080
to apologize

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.920
um

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.680
Oh my god, are you ever going to do a generation of guys?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.600
Uh, no smile. This is a whammy agency. Um, I apologize

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:53.560
We don't do that here. Um, no, I'm absolutely nothing against male v-tubers and stuff

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.520
But the only reason you know strongy can

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.400
Stronetize is because strongy

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.360
strongy has

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.680
knowledge and experience and stuff

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:12.200
So I will apply it to the girls and yeah, but I'm not a guy as much as I would like to have a weenus

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.280
I'm not a guy

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.200
So I can't help guys

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.040
Can't help guys succeed

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.000
Sorry

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
However, I can appeal to guys

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.280
You know, but some things I say with a broken voice like yeah, I'm sure you like this voice on you

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.280
And

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.080
strongy max and honestly hold on take another drink

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.640
I've got a 2.0 to thinking

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.320
As well

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.400
I think what we'll do is I'm gonna redirect into sheebie

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.960
And then I'll pull up my uh my 2.0 where I'm just yapping about myself

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:56.120
Uh, right. I'm go any more questions that I can right stop typing fondle of booze up, right?

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.280
And now if I'm trying to look for questions

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.920
um

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.000
When can I buy a sheebie boob on mouse pad?

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:13.960
So the girl's birthdays are when they're going to do donathons and um, I actually might do an open stream

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.960
Where we can all discuss it together

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:21.000
Azura is the first donathon. Don't worry Azura if you're watching. I'm gonna help you through it

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.960
She doesn't really know what she's doing, but I'll help her. Um, I'm going to focus on

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.920
public rewards

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.240
I'm gonna burp again

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.640
Oh my god

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.840
Sorry, sorry. Sorry. I'm talking a lot

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:39.240
um

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:41.240
I'm going to be focusing on

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.400
Jen

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:48.200
The chat going not something I go through it. You see I fell off my chair

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.920
Sorry

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.920
um

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.680
What was I saying?

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:59.560
Uh, yes, we can work on donathon goals together. I will help the girls through it because uh, some are a bit unsure

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.600
They've never done one before hell. I've never done a donathon before

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:09.480
Definitely going to focus on public rewards at milestones and this is just me personally

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.200
I'm absolutely not going for anyone. Don't care what the timing is but um

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:22.200
Some like I've seen some donathons and the jump is like 5 000 us dollars between like the next goal

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.040
And I'm like going to be serious

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:29.400
Can you actually not think of one thing to do for like another 500 bucks or like another like

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.240
One of the biggest jumps I saw I think was 20 000 us dollars

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:39.240
I'm like you can't think of like one thing to do in between 20 000 us dollars like no

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.120
We're not doing that here

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:46.200
So I'm helping the girls to try and like pick through what to do for donathons and get rewards and all that thing

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.640
Uh, I don't know if it was a joke or a meme because it was like pretty crazy

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.160
um

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.480
I'd miss this but how does violour make money if almost everything goes to the talent

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:06.760
We got so much feedback on that. I this is terrible and I can't believe I have to say this

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.080
But we're not an agency built on corporate greed

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.720
Full stop that's the sentence

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:22.680
We don't have corporate greed and the running costs of an agency after you've done the start of costs of buying the models and

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:26.920
Getting the girls set up for stream is very low

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:31.400
It does not cost a lot of money to actually tell the girls to go stream like

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:39.400
It doesn't cost me any money right now to click go live and have a good time or to go away and record an ASMR video and upload it

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:45.640
I know in this day and age where corporate greed is everywhere around the corner

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.000
We're not an agency for corporate greed

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:55.000
I hope you understand that the 80 20 split for this year the next year if the girl signs on the 15

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:03.000
Like the focus on the agency is to help the girls achieve their dreams. I know it's ambitious

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:09.480
I know we're new and we're just out of the starting gate, but I hope no strong a yaw

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:12.120
fucking burn the yaw

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:19.720
No yaw for me because I don't buddy want one. I want the success of my daughters

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:23.560
Go subscribe to them. Go give them a chance. Okay

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:29.480
I'm not having none of this corporate greed shit in my house. Get the fuck out of here without anyway

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.560
That's just my two cents

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:35.160
But yes, um

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:41.160
The reason why the company and oh and another thing and another thing. I'm gonna get started again

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:48.600
Oh wait already said that they're already said that the company has been seeded the company is not in debt to banks

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:50.680
The company is not indebted to

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:58.040
The company has been seeded, which means the money was already there. It was just funneled into this one. Okay

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.920
Okay

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.760
Woohoo

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:08.440
Oh, what about legal staff? Are you ready for this bit? We don't even have a hr department

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.840
We just sexually harass each other for fun

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.320
Yippie

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.840
We don't have that kind of business set up

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:25.720
Is there's no hr so none of the girls can report to me report me if I say anything not

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:35.000
Sorry, I keep taking a drink of coal and then hypnotizing you real quick. That's true

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:40.680
I'll actually everyone gets paid. That was another thing that came up actually. Um

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:49.320
How this is this is actually not vtuber related. This is just human related and it's like hey, how do you get your

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.400
um

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:56.440
Your employees to like work and it was like, uh, actually pay them above minimum wage

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.800
Like if you go to the girls and go would you rather?

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.120
Ah

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.440
Atchoo

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:09.960
Okay, maybe we do slightly maybe have some sort of management. I'm fucking scared. Get out of here management

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.160
I don't run the social accounts or anything like that. My gosh. My gosh. My gosh

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.680
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't say anything more

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:28.280
Okay, okay, I call I call most of the shots I call most of the shots

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:33.080
Right, what was that saying? Oh, right. Yeah, if you're

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:39.000
I think one of the it was like the most dumbest post was like I can't get my employees to work hard type thing

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:42.440
And it was like, uh, yeah, because you're paying them minimum wage

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.560
Maybe if you actually make them feel like valued employees

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:50.040
Uh, which is where the 8020 split came in as well because I'm really sick of seeing vtuber agencies

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.960
Just being really greedy and I was like, well, I'm gonna do the opposite and I get to call the shots

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:58.440
So, yeah, 820 time for a black. No, not the freaking white

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.160
No, the black text on the white background. Oh my god. I'm being graduated already

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:08.200
Oh, it was a good run. That was a good run. See you next year when I start up the next feature break

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.480
Uh, it's 3d content plan for we need we just go out of the gates

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:21.480
You need to give the girls some some money if you want to get 3d models because uh, we spend a lot of money

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:26.200
Just get into the stage. Okay. I'm gonna be honest and you put your money where your mouth is if you want to see that content

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:31.720
Vsucky 2026, let's go Vsucky

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.600
That's why you guys stream on youtube instead of twitch

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:43.960
So twitch and youtube is like pick the lesser of two evils and from a management point of view youtube

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.960
You can manage accounts on

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.160
We regret to inform you that strongly causes me power. Oh, that's another thing. Yeah

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:52.840
We don't have

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.120
Uh, what's the word? I've already forgotten the word because we don't do it

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:01.800
What is it called when management put the talent on leave like forced leave?

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.240
What the heck is that word? I don't even know what that word is

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:13.720
Shadowban, yeah, we don't suspension. We don't do suspensions at vlr. So rest assured

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:19.960
When your vtuber is self-suspense. Yeah, we don't do that here. The girls don't get suspended

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:25.000
I have this terrible thing. It's called a treating people like adults

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:29.880
And yeah, we don't do suspensions. Uh, if the girls do a naughty, naughty, guess what?

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:35.640
I'm not their mom. I'm not here to spank their butt and be like, you're a naughty naughty girl. Um, so

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:38.600
yeah

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:42.280
Yeah, the girls do what they want. It's crazy

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:46.600
It's like if you treat people like adults then they kind of act like adults

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.880
It's a wild concept really. It's really crazy in this day and age

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.480
What if she be suspending from the ceiling?

01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:01.640
What are your plans for youtube membership? Whatever the girls want to do for membership

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:07.400
They have complete control of I have I am not dictating any talents content at all

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.320
I do not dictate it. I do not tell them what to stream. I do not tell them what to do

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:15.320
So what they would like to do in their membership streams are completely up to them

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.760
I do not dictate. We don't dictate in this house

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.240
We treat people like adults. Why act like an adult when fondle abyssal?

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:30.520
It was a bad name. It was one bad name. Okay. They were all bad concept names

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:36.680
But give me credit for freaking emmy bezoo. Come on, man. That's such a cute name. We emmy bezoo

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:40.600
They say or should I say in a french accent?

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:41.960
Oh

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.040
Cran beat right, you know what?

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:47.480
It was a bad name. I admit it. It was a it was a bad name

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.400
V sucky the proper V sucky talent fondle abyssal

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.600
Stabitha marks. Oh god

01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:02.680
Don't don't put me in the kitchen. I know I'm a woman, but don't put me in the kitchen to cook again because that was awful

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:07.000
Milker tip right right right. You're done. You're done. Right. Hold on

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.320

She be caught in bum live in 30 minutes. I repeat she be caught in bum live in 30 minutes

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.840
Just so you guys can hold out

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:23.640
Oh

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:26.120
Ivan yankum avano yanko

01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.360
Can't answer that one sorry, uh

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.640
Any unique chat rules or behavior guidance?

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:38.120
Guidances for this agency

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:45.560
Uh, just let the vtuber talk and uh, let the talent talk and if she doesn't like what you're saying she'll say it

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.600
But like obviously because the agency is a bit more

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.280
Uh, obviously the chat can be a bit more

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.560
Uh, yeah

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:00.280
No, she be's gone live in 30

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.160
I'm gonna raid into her and then I'm gonna do my two

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:10.040
2.0, but I don't have to be professional in it like after the stream. Oh, I'm not being very professional right now

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.040
I'm a burping into your mouth, but um

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:17.320
After uh, I'm just memeing as myself. I don't have to do any more official stuff

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.200
Are you rating my bird?

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:23.560
I'm terminated in 30 minute. You better not be

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:26.280
get then

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:27.960
uh

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:33.960
Would it be okay to create fan comics and post online? Absolutely the girls love any fan arts coming through as beautiful

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:41.880
Wait 100 duck sized ryan reynolds or 100 ryan reynolds duck sized

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:43.960
to keep

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:49.080
What what how is that agency related at all? You're just bamboozling me

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.120
Um, I know this may be jumping the gun quite a bit

01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:00.600
But based on how you think have you already thought about gen 2 possibilities? Oh, that's a good question. Um

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.560
Uh

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:09.080
For the donathons of the girls one of the goals will be revealing a concept art of gen 2

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:14.520
I understand we've just debuted, but if I'm happy to be as open as you guys are interested

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:19.160
So you're welcome to ask any questions. Uh, but yeah one of uh azure's

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:25.000
Pfft donathons coming up and you guys can vote to reveal a design if you want up to you

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.560
um

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:32.040
Someone asked if it's possible. We would have a branch

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:37.960
Um a branch of veiler that didn't require the not-safer work

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.840
audio parts

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.280
In the nicest way

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.360
I

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.400
The cut wouldn't be the same

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.480
I just I couldn't I can't see it working out

01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:58.120
Everything is based on what I have learned over the span of many years

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:00.760
of what is occurring

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.760
Tan cute and funny. I bet she

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.960
She didn't

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:09.800
Okay, I will tell the plan later. You can tell it on your screen if you want to but

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.120
Um

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.240
Will the patreon uploads

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:22.200
Be dictated by the talents. No the content is given by management

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.400
I actually have a script manager coming in place soon for the girls

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:31.960
If you have any audios that you don't like, please direct your grievances with me at this stage

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:37.320
And then you can grieve at the manager that's coming in because that can't be our stealing all the scripts

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:40.440
Um

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.720
Yes

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:52.120
The girls are not pigeonholed into one category of audios that would be impossible to get them to succeed

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:59.640
That is just the truth of the matter. I understand that some of the audios might not play into the thingy

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.040
But I cannae have polar bear shags you polar bear shags you again

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:08.360
Polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.840
Be in every single audio

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.840
Please be realistic with me

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.840
That's not gonna appeal to the masses

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:22.360
And at the end of the day, uh, these girls are wanting to move out. They're wanting to save money for their futures

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:27.240
They want to pay off debts possibly this kind of thing. So please

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.920
Please be realistic with us. Okay

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.320
Thank you. I do appreciate that

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.000
Um, is there a way to submit scripts for the talents?

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:45.160
Possible plausible at this point in time. I do not have a system in place like that

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:52.040
It is plausible in the future. Uh, you'll have to let things things need to kind of we need to level out and we need to

01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:53.720
um

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.680
How do you call it? We need to like settle down the dust hasn't settled literally we're freaking day

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:00.760
debuted

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.760
Um all that kind of thing. Um

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.760
Hmm

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:11.400
How likely are what are off club? How likely are off collabs based on location?

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:15.160
You mean like the girls meeting up?

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.280
I can make it happen

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:23.320
I get taxed back on their travel expenses. I can make that shit happen if they want

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.280
Um

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:36.600
Uh, you said violour does not require the girly pops to get permission for various projects

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.320
Uh, how about showing face?

01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:44.520
No, I don't really recommend it for him. Well, uh, so isn't male collabs?

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:47.640
You'll never guess what one of the unwritten rules of ours are

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.360
Uh

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.840
There ain't gonna be any males on this. How do you pronounce violour?

01:41:55.240 --> 01:42:00.600
Well, I'm Scottish so the word I look like a luring. You're a luring violour, but

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.680
V allure

01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:08.920
But if you ever come from a different place, yeah, like feet cam hand cam that stuff's fine. The girls don't need permission for that

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:15.720
Uh, you'll never see my face. Phil stop and I'm a feature. Yeah, I'd say probably face stuff is like

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:20.040
I'll never I'll never stop the talent but

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.560
Um

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.520
Uh

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.440
Oh, this is a good question

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:36.040
Have you started the agency on its own or did you get any sponsors or investors? Nope

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:45.720
So when the agency was becoming an agency, uh, there were actually multiple offers for like split ownership and that kind of thing

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.960
The last thing I want is anyone meddling with my girls. So absolutely not

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:58.040
I rejected them all. I have absolutely no interest in anyone else having

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:01.240
Anything to do ownership wise

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:06.200
Other than knowing that the girls are in my good hands. Okay

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:13.560
Uh, there was also whispers of like, oh, you can sell this this business on if it gets big

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.120
And let me stop you right there

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.160
I trust myself for these girls

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.320
I do not trust anyone else with these girls

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:31.160
So thank you for your interest in your acquisition your investment

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:35.640
However, if you want to invest, how about you?

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440
invest in some

01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:41.640
merchandise official veal or

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.520
I'm just rolling with you

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:53.080
Uh, why go with patreon over other

01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:56.120
locations

01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:01.320
It is safe to link patreon on youtube as long as everything is behind of paywall

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:06.440
There is a large established market on patreon

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:13.000
If there is ever anything to happen, there are multiple websites that can be utilized in case

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:18.040
Please do not worry. Okay. There are many reasons behind

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.680
Um developmental wise, but I hope it's kind of here

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.440
a

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:33.560
What are your plans for the future of veal or um for me personally

01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:39.800
It is helping the girls achieve their great dreams. A lot of them were interested in 3d models

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:44.280
Um, definitely do that. There's a few that are interested in a few song covers

01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:46.840
I'll help them pursue that maybe with their own original song

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:53.800
But my goals are the girls goals. Um, and if you mean my actual personal goals, I'll talk about that in 2.0

01:44:53.800 --> 01:45:00.120
But my goals are the girls goals. Yeah, I want to help them be successful and be happy. Um, yeah, good life

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:07.480
We'll give you the inspiration to make veal or um corporate greed hate

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.080
We hate corporate greed

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.080
That's my sense

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.440
And

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:22.600
I keep seeing people say welcome back. Did you used to be a feature bar before this?

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:25.160
Um

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:28.680
I'm straw any cuttles. Let's leave it at that. Okay

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.440
I'm straw any cuttles and I'm very happy to be here

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:36.440
And if you're a fan of me, you may like to refer to yourself as a refling

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:42.680
And it's a good life. Okay, and thank you guys for being respectful and letting me

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.400
Let me be straw any

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.400
much happy

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:54.360
Uh petition to name your Celtic alternative your scottl fish out there. Oh, that's really creative

01:45:54.440 --> 01:46:00.280
Right, sorry. I should have should have read that should have read that as a as a straw. And let's see if there's any questions

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.160
um

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:07.720
I think that's all the agency questions unless of refresh and there's like a billion more. Oh

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:12.440
That's a lot more questions. I just came through if I didn't say um

01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:15.640
We've got 20 minute timer for shibu

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.320
Shibu de toilet. All right. Sorry. I'm sorry though. If emmy didn't say that

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:27.000
If emmy didn't say shibu de toilet, I would never have said that myself. I'm so sorry

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.800
It was emmy blame emmy. It was emmy. She started it

01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:34.840
She started it

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:44.920
Oh my god, I never even told you the funniest thing. So, uh, we had our like we were together for two months before we debuted

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:51.160
And the weirdest thing ever was like, uh instead of like their meetings where like the girls got to know each other

01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:55.320
I was like, right. Let's go play among us together for the first time

01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:04.920
Oh, so we were like freaking a zero was absolutely smoking us. So I'm going to recalibrate my little leech ever. Hold on my mic

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.760
Okay, there we go. My mic's a bit better than my mic

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:13.800
Um, yeah, we had to like do forced among like for your game

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:20.520
Hey, let me try to say to like make everyone comfortable around each other. Yeah, we played like whiplash

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:27.640
Um, this game where like you can I can't remember the title of it, but it was like really good. It was fun

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.360
um

01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:36.600
Sorry, I just had a little

01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.200
Jack box that was it. We played like jack box together and stuff

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.680
um

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:44.760
Are the girls free to collab whoever they want?

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.960
Yes, asterix

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.160
As long as I've no got a willy

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.360
I don't care who they collab with we can go nuts for all I care

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:59.560
Why are the girls so cute? Is that part of your hypnosis? Have I trained you?

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.280
Trained you to like the girl

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:09.960
Uh, how open to merch suggestions? Are you from fans like design ideas and such go for it? But the

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.320
You know this this agency's kind of

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:20.760
I'm gonna I need to word my words careful word my words carefully. I am I need to word myself carefully

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.480
but most like

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:28.120
I want to say most agencies aren't so open and taking feedback

01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.680
Whereas like I want to say like

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:37.320
Hey, we've literally just started. Of course, we're gonna fuck up here and there something's gonna go wrong

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:43.480
But like we're open to suggestions like oh, I think this is a good idea. I think that's a good idea

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.520
You know

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.240
I want to say that

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:53.880
And

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:59.480
Someone says do the talents own the games on the steam account. Oh fucking course

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:07.080
Did you buy the game surprise surprise you get to keep it very very very hard concept

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:09.800
for some people to comprehend but

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:16.280
Yeah, the talents if they buy it they keep it crazy concept. I know truly

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.320
Mindfongling

01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.700
Who came up with mersey's design?

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:27.160
Everything is by squishy girl. The website's getting an update

01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.920
It's actually taken quite long to to produce the update because there's quite a lot of information that's going to be in it

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.440
So give us a hot second to produce that

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.640
um

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:46.680
Supposing that someone has an edit in portfolio, can they apply for a video editor?

01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.640
Yeah, uh clippers editors. Um, I want to try and do a clipping program

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:56.920
Where you get money very like idle. I'm not even gonna like say otherwise

01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:03.240
Adel do a clipping program where if you clip the girl every thousand views you get a dollar type thing

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:10.120
I'm quite interested in that style because you're not forced to only clip us you can clip whoever you want on the side

01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:12.680
and obviously

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:15.960
Need a wee bit of money to come back in before I can do something like that

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.120
But I really do like the concept of it. Very good. Very nice. Very good

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.960
Um, I like it very much

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.960
Uh

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:41.240
Sorry, I'm just I'm just reading some of the questions. I can't say it loud as I read it because it's you know

01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:44.680
Um

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:48.440
Sorry, I'm reading I'm reading just in case

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:52.760
Uh

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:57.000
Hold on. Hold on. I'm reading. I'm reading. I'm reading. You guys are just saying inappropriate stuff about

01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.720
sorry the guy the the talent the

01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.720
comments are like

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:04.360
I would do this to ac I would do this to emi and I'm like

01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:07.080
But that's not a question about the agency

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:15.240
How long did it take to get the hired selection progress process? Oh my god

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.920
Oh my god, you've just activated my neurons

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:25.640
So the the application pool was open for a month

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:33.320
And then the way the twitter said like in 48 hours or something you're gonna get an email

01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:40.680
And someone was like, oh my god, there's no way they're gonna go through all those applications in two days

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:43.240
No, you idiot

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:44.840
You

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:50.040
Numpty of course we were going through the applications as they came in

01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.480
You genuinely thought

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:58.280
That when they close is when agencies go through them

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:02.120
Come on

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.940
Rub those brain cells together

01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:10.760
You genuinely think that agencies

01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:15.160
Close applications and then start going through them. No

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:20.280
I had a freaking battle royale tier system going on for the girls

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.160
goodness gravy

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:32.200
Goodness gravy some of the comments come on me. I'm no very smart myself, but the moon man you're taking my pass

01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:38.440
Uh, are there rules surrounding clipping the talents? Absolutely not go nuts knock yourself out

01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:41.480
Thank you because it costs a lot to pay for clipping

01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:48.600
Um, will you ever hire programmers sadly? I don't need a programmer. It's just fix

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.440
Hey

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:58.520
Battle royale tier system. Okay, right. I can to you can talk about this

01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:03.080
So as the applications came in if I found a girl that was suitable

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:05.960
I would pick out the model for you

01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:09.880
And there was first place second place third place

01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:12.040
but

01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:18.680
The choices were so like obvious to me if it made sense like

01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:25.720
Emmy was Emmy. I see was I see, you know, like the choices were so obvious that it was like do the interview

01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:33.400
And you're in type thing. Uh, I have a no bullshit apology. I have a no bullshit approach to interviews

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:37.480
So and the girls can talk about it if they so desire. I basically

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:40.280
Went into the interview with them and I said

01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:43.160
Right off the bat. I said, hey

01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:47.160
We want you as a talent. You absolutely do not have to impress me in this call

01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:50.760
Okay, you don't have to impress me. I want you already

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:55.880
Here's a list of stuff that you need to know before you sign on if you want to sign on. Okay

01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:02.520
Did you have a lot of candidates for fondlet? No, Azura was the only like there was no one else for Azura

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:07.320
If Zura rejected that position. I was up shit creek. I'm not even fucking saying nothing

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.920
Yeah

01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:13.240
angry scottish is more

01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:16.360
um

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:18.360
but yeah, uh

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:22.760
Within like 24 hours people were emailed and that was it

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:31.400
Are you going are your models gonna stick? Oh, sorry. Are you in the

01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:33.960
Models stick to these avatar

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.800
Hey

01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:42.200
You mean like new outfits and stuff now the girls can get new outfits or 2.0 or whatever or 3d models perfectly fine with me

01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:46.360
Um

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.560
Uh

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:56.600
Are you ever worried about your relationship with the girls considering your gen mates and a boss funny you mentioned that I told them

01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.240
in the interview

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:04.120
Don't call me boss. Don't refer to me as your boss. Do not think of me as your boss

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.200
I am not your boss

01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:11.400
Don't ever place me above you mentally in your head. I do not want that

01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.040
I am the creative director

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.600
wink wink

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:20.040
So they do not call me boss. They do not call me superior

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:26.040
Yes, she V called me boss ma'am and I was like no, please don't ever

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:32.680
Like do that because I don't want anyone thinking in their head like oh my god. I can't approach her. I can't talk to her

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:36.200
No, I don't want that

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:38.840
I don't like them

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:44.520
I don't want anyone to ever think that I am superior to them in any way unless it's their kink

01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:48.680
I said it I said it

01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:52.600
Um

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:58.200
Let me check let me

01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:02.200
Um

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:05.320
Also at the end of the day, I'm not really a boss anymore

01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:08.680
Like now that debuts are over everything's like up to the girl

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.800
The only boss thing really is like hey, have you recorded that?

01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:17.720
Audio for patreon. Yes or no, and then that's it

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
There's nothing else to it

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:23.240
Um

01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:28.760
So yeah leader

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:33.400
Yeah, uh, basically just tell them like hey, I did this and I'll show them stats and stuff

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:35.400
And I'm like this is what I think you should do

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:37.800
but they don't really ask for advice because

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:40.280
Uh, I'll mention I'll repeat this again

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.480
All the girls have more streaming experience than me

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:50.280
So it's really hypocritical for me to be like hey go stream this go stream that no I have full faith in these girls

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:56.040
Uh, they are absolutely fantastic. They're lovely everything. I have absolutely no problems

01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:02.040
I have complete faith in them and absolutely nothing is worrisome at all. So

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:04.920
Yeah

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:11.160
She goes live in eight minutes

01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:16.520
Hold on let me get confirmation that I raid into she be's 2.0

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Um for those of you

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:21.960
Who would like to part ways and join she be's 2.0?

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.440
Please absolutely do

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:29.640
Uh, I will also be doing my 2.0 at the exact same time, but I am in uh

01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:33.640
I highly recommend you do she burs she sturs

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:39.000
um because she is nothing but an angel and uh

01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:45.720
I would love you to support my daughters over me. This is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:53.560
What's my 2.0? I'm I'm gonna answer questions about myself and stuff, but this is kind of more agency focus

01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:56.120
Yeah

01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:58.440
Um

01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:01.560
Someone asked do you have plans for auditions for gen 2?

01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:04.200
My guy

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:06.200
We debuted yesterday

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:11.960
Unless you're actually interested in joining the agency that's different. Um the

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:14.600
We were a year away from

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:19.640
My focus is on helping these girls achieve their dreams and seeing where we go

01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:24.840
You know, you need to let let they've literally just been birthed from my lines

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:30.120
Give them a chance to like, you know get their their knee joints working and all that jazz

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:36.440
Yeah, let's everyone cook first, but it's it's a year away. Um, that we're

01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:40.200
Yeah

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:47.400
That's

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:50.760
Okay, any questions on youtube because

01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:57.080
Marshmallow drying up like my voice box. Honestly, whose voice is it?

01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:07.960
You've invested a lot of money into this understand that the marriage goes to the girls, but how exactly do you recoup your investment?

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:10.840
me

01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:13.240
I keep 100% of what I

01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:16.920
Uh

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:23.160
Don't worry about like thank you very much for worrying about investment costs and stuff, but like this this is big

01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:26.520
This is again, not for greed

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:31.800
This is for me to do my thing and I have five lovely girls who I also recommend

01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.600
And I want them to be able to do their thing

01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:38.040
And yeah

01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:43.240
Let them cook man. I'll cook don't don't worry about the money. Okay. Don't worry about the money some things in life are

01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:45.560
more important than

01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:46.600
great

01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:53.480
And I don't mean you're implying that I'm greedy because obviously everyone wants to return on investment if you will but

01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:57.480
Let's just have a good time. Like I'm playing Assassin's Creed tomorrow

01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:00.600
I'm going to tell you about that some of the developmental lore of that game

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:06.680
I'm going to tell you a little tip bits about glitches that occur in that game. I'm just here for a good time

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:09.240
Okay

02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:12.120
Uh

02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:15.320
When was velar started? Uh, it's been a one year

02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:21.160
Development. Uh, actually I'm going to give you the name of the song the girls were

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:25.640
Uh, I was the girls were concepted. Oh god. Was it?

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:42.120
All right, this is the song. Sorry. I just completely went off in my head

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:46.440
This is the song the girls, uh, were birthed to

02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:49.320
one year ago

02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:53.720
This song so open that up in a oh should be started

02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:01.480

02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:04.280
Uh

02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:07.480
For legal reason? No

02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:11.400
Because we're not a Japanese based company

02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:18.200
We don't have to worry about that copyright shit that other agencies are like fucking tied to

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
It's not a rec roll

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.920
So that's the song that the girls were made to see and give a listen to uh, I am going to end the stream

02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:37.800
Because shuby cotton bum is streaming and she's going to talk about 2.0

02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:41.480
I'm going to boot back up my 2.0 where I'm just going to ramble

02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:44.040
