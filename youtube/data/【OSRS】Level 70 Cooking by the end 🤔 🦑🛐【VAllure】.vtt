WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.680
What is that noise? It sounds like the fire.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.680
Oh, there we go.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.920
Oh, he's like, this world is free.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.920
Oh, this is too early.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.920
Three, he believes it.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.920
Right.

00:31.920 --> 00:35.920
Obviously, I've jumped into the game.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.920
Oh, wait a minute.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.920
Oh, wait, can I hear myself?

00:41.920 --> 00:43.920
Oh, wait, can I hear myself?

00:43.920 --> 00:45.920
Oh, wait, I can't hear myself.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.920
Jeez.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.920
Get the door.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.920
Get the door.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.920
Mama.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.920
Mummy's here.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.920
Uh, I'm going to open.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.920
Um...

01:03.920 --> 01:07.920
Hi, good morning. Good evening.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.920
Good afternoon.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.920
Uh, how is that all fit to scale?

01:15.920 --> 01:19.920
Oh, wait, that doesn't fit to scale at all, Runelight.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.920
Is that like that last stream?

01:23.920 --> 01:27.920
It doesn't... wait, why is this on top of the freaking thing?

01:27.920 --> 01:31.920
No, don't do that. That's even worse.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.920
Go below.

01:33.920 --> 01:37.920
Why is there two Runelights?

01:37.920 --> 01:41.920
Do I have the game captures myself?

01:41.920 --> 01:43.920
Okay, no, that looks correct.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.920
I just need to do that.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.920
Okay, Rinscape is just a funny-shaped game, okay?

01:49.920 --> 01:51.920
It's going to be scoff.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.920
It's just a funny-shaped game.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.920
I'm too dumb for to figure out.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.920
Is that a refling?

01:57.920 --> 02:01.920
Refling, you already in?

02:01.920 --> 02:05.920
Other player has accepted?

02:05.920 --> 02:07.920
I'm like, damn, Reflings, you're quick.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.920
We are in world high...

02:09.920 --> 02:11.920
Oh, it's replays.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.920
Hi, uh, red e-fling.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.920
That's how I spell it.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.920
Damn, Reflings are shown off.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.920
I'm not even freaking said like,

02:19.920 --> 02:21.920
oh, this is my update for today.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.920
No way, they have freaking Gangnam style

02:25.920 --> 02:27.920
and freaking Rinscape 07.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.920
Old school.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.920
I don't know why I said 07 though.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.920
Oh, my Gangnam style.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.920
Uh-oh.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.920
Sexy refling.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.920
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.920
Open them Gangnam style.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.920
Howdy-ow.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.920
Good morning, good evening,

02:45.920 --> 02:47.920
and good after noon.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.920
I hope you guys are ready

02:49.920 --> 02:53.920
for a cheeky endurance stream.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.920
Hi, Reflings. Hi, Strone, I guess.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.920
Uh, yeah, I hope you're ready

02:57.920 --> 02:59.920
for a cheeky endurance today.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.920
Um, I...

03:01.920 --> 03:03.920
had a bit of business

03:03.920 --> 03:05.920
going on behind the scenes

03:05.920 --> 03:07.920
business, business, business.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.920
So, uh, I hope to have

03:09.920 --> 03:11.920
quite a fun update soon.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.920
I've just told the girls what the business was,

03:13.920 --> 03:15.920
and, uh,

03:15.920 --> 03:17.920
someone's very excited.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.920
I just read their message,

03:19.920 --> 03:21.920
but it made me giggle,

03:21.920 --> 03:23.920
but I can't say or else spoilers.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.920
Let me open up my inventory

03:25.920 --> 03:27.920
so you guys can see what's up.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.920
Yes, we are business, business, business.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.920
We're doing, like, straight-up business, business, business.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.920
Um, like, I'm...

03:35.920 --> 03:37.920
The only thing I'm used to is

03:37.920 --> 03:39.920
sponsorship people reaching out to me

03:39.920 --> 03:41.920
and being like, hey, for a 60-second segment,

03:41.920 --> 03:43.920
I will pay you this much.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.920
This is what is going on.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.920
Um, and then I'm just like...

03:47.920 --> 03:49.920
Oh, yeah.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.920
But this time,

03:51.920 --> 03:53.920
um,

03:53.920 --> 03:55.920
I got...

03:55.920 --> 03:57.920
I will talk about it a bit more.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.920
I'm gonna ask permission if I can talk about it,

03:59.920 --> 04:01.920
because, um, the person is associated

04:01.920 --> 04:03.920
with an agency that helped out to...

04:03.920 --> 04:05.920
and if they're comfortable with it,

04:05.920 --> 04:07.920
I'm happy to talk about, obviously, nothing.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.920
Azur got monetized?

04:11.920 --> 04:13.920
Are you telling me Azur got monetized?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.920
I went to bed and Azur wasn't monetized.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.920
Shibi was, which made me think

04:19.920 --> 04:21.920
within 24 hours Azur is getting reviewed next.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.920
I just hope her massive fucking

04:23.920 --> 04:25.920
honkers don't, uh...

04:25.920 --> 04:27.920
Uh...

04:27.920 --> 04:29.920
I know

04:29.920 --> 04:31.920
DEMPA isn't

04:31.920 --> 04:33.920
in here right now.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.920
DEMPA's just messaged me.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.920
She's...

04:37.920 --> 04:39.920
strong angry. You have a lot on your plate.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.920
Do you think Ace of the Masters?

04:41.920 --> 04:43.920
What do you need, DEMPA?

04:43.920 --> 04:45.920
I won't charge.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.920
DEMPA, I won't charge, darling.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.920
Oh, DEMPA,

04:49.920 --> 04:51.920
you're so adorable.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.920
Never charge friends.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.920
Always do it for free because

04:55.920 --> 04:57.920
when you have friends like these,

04:57.920 --> 04:59.920
life is good.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.920
I have not even known DEMPA

05:01.920 --> 05:03.920
for more than two weeks

05:03.920 --> 05:05.920
and she's been nothing but a sweetheart to me.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.920
Right, I am going to go to the bank

05:07.920 --> 05:09.920
and clear out all my fishes in the background

05:09.920 --> 05:11.920
whilst I ramble to you.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.920
I have absolutely terrible news.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.920
Just...

05:15.920 --> 05:17.920
upshot news.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.920
I tried to take a Joby,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.920
but the Joby wouldn't have come.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.920
So...

05:23.920 --> 05:25.920
I'm probably going to have to take a big steamer

05:25.920 --> 05:27.920
in the middle of the stream

05:27.920 --> 05:29.920
which I'm raging

05:29.920 --> 05:31.920
because I hate...

05:31.920 --> 05:33.920
I'll always go for a shower

05:33.920 --> 05:35.920
after I do a big

05:35.920 --> 05:37.920
Joby

05:37.920 --> 05:39.920
because I can't... wait, should I just make a...

05:39.920 --> 05:41.920
I think it would actually be faster.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.920
Hold on, Reflens. I think it's going to be faster

05:43.920 --> 05:45.920
if I take wood out and

05:45.920 --> 05:47.920
I...

05:49.920 --> 05:51.920
Do I even have wood?

05:53.920 --> 05:55.920
Do I even have an axe?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.920
It must... I do have an axe.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.920
Okay, then I need a

05:59.920 --> 06:01.920
tinderbox.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.920
Okay.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.920
I don't actually have a bit of wood.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.920
Right, that's fine though. We're going to go get it.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.920
Right, we'll chop here

06:09.920 --> 06:11.920
and then I'm going to make a fire outside the bank for now

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
just to eliminate

06:13.920 --> 06:15.920
all of my inventory.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.920
Oh, juice.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.920
Oh, tiny cuttles

06:19.920 --> 06:21.920
wants to trade with you.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.920
What's your name?

06:23.920 --> 06:25.920
Well, baby cuttles.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.920
Um...

06:27.920 --> 06:29.920
Hi. Oh, you already given me one.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.920
Thank you.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.920
Yes, I will be needing these. Thank you very much.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.920
Little easy.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.920
The best way to ruin friendship is get money

06:37.920 --> 06:39.920
involved.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.920
I went until I learned

06:41.920 --> 06:43.920
about the development team drama.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.920
Oh my god!

06:45.920 --> 06:47.920
I've got a really funny fucking comment.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.920
So, you know how I'm always telling you about

06:49.920 --> 06:51.920
like, oh, we...

06:51.920 --> 06:53.920
All I have on hand for wood right now

06:53.920 --> 06:55.920
your wood is

06:55.920 --> 06:57.920
more than enough.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.920
Little roofling, I assure you.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.920
A winky face, because we all know

07:01.920 --> 07:03.920
what we're talking about.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.920
Um...

07:05.920 --> 07:07.920
I'm a mor... Oh, damn, bullshit!

07:07.920 --> 07:09.920
I was talking about you!

07:09.920 --> 07:11.920
Um...

07:11.920 --> 07:13.920
I'm so scared.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.920
I never streamed on YouTube.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.920
Oh, you don't actually have to mod anything.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.920
It's like customary to make you

07:19.920 --> 07:21.920
mod

07:21.920 --> 07:23.920
so that

07:23.920 --> 07:25.920
you stand out more in chat.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.920
DEMPA, I'm so sorry.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.920
I was just exposing you. I just said

07:29.920 --> 07:31.920
that you wanted an ASMR script

07:31.920 --> 07:33.920
and I'm offering it for free, because I would never charge you for that.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.920
You're...

07:35.920 --> 07:37.920
Oh, freaking sick. I'm just not...

07:37.920 --> 07:39.920
Wait, let me pick up... I'm doing two things.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.920
Right, let me finish up the...

07:41.920 --> 07:43.920
Why did that only take out one?

07:43.920 --> 07:45.920
Oh, it's not looking good.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.920
Now you all know that I'm a RuneScape noob.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.920
Oh, yeah, YouTube custom.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.920
Yes, you're learning, right?

07:53.920 --> 07:55.920
Use Tinder Box on the logs.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.920
Oh my god, you got a little cabbage head going on.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.920
Okay, right.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.920
Oh, I don't want to brag, but I'm level 2

08:03.920 --> 08:05.920
if I'm making... Right, we are going to just get rid of...

08:05.920 --> 08:07.920
Not rid of, but...

08:09.920 --> 08:11.920
But yeah, you don't...

08:11.920 --> 08:13.920
Yeah, so, as I was saying,

08:13.920 --> 08:15.920
we got a little hate comment today on YouTube.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.920
But do you want to know why it's so funny?

08:19.920 --> 08:21.920
It's because

08:21.920 --> 08:23.920
most of the comments were like,

08:23.920 --> 08:25.920
vealers aren't going to last a month.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.920
And then it went to two months

08:27.920 --> 08:29.920
and it went to six months.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.920
Do you want to know what today's hate comment

08:31.920 --> 08:33.920
and quotation marks was that I had to delete

08:33.920 --> 08:35.920
vealers aren't going to last

08:35.920 --> 08:37.920
two years.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.920
Motherfucker, if vealers last

08:39.920 --> 08:41.920
two years, all three generations

08:41.920 --> 08:43.920
are successfully out.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.920
I don't... What?

08:45.920 --> 08:47.920
Are you dumb?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.920
I like how it went from not even going to last

08:49.920 --> 08:51.920
a week, not even going to last a month.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.920
Two years? Two years, all three genes are out.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.920
Two years and I have succeeded

08:55.920 --> 08:57.920
in what I wanted to do.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.920
Duh.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.920
I literally just like multiplied the time

09:01.920 --> 09:03.920
dramatically.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.920
And literally, it's a supportive message.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.920
I'm like, nice try, but

09:07.920 --> 09:09.920
bruv, wait, sorry. I think a re-film is trying

09:09.920 --> 09:11.920
to trade me. Sorry.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
Sorry.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.920
I'm sorry, bruv, yet it didn't mean to not trade you.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.920
What?

09:17.920 --> 09:19.920
10,000

09:19.920 --> 09:21.920
swordfish? Isn't that not like

09:21.920 --> 09:23.920
99 right there? Am I going crazy?

09:23.920 --> 09:25.920
Are you sure?

09:25.920 --> 09:27.920
Oh my god.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.920
Oh my god.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.920
Wait, wait, wait.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.920
Another reflin?

09:33.920 --> 09:35.920
Uh...

09:35.920 --> 09:37.920
Oh no.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.920
Oh my god, reflin.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.920
Alright, I'm getting drunk.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.920
I'm getting drunk as a skunk.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.920
Actually, I think we're doing

09:45.920 --> 09:47.920
drunk stream near the end.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.920
Helps make the job a...

09:49.920 --> 09:51.920
I literally

09:51.920 --> 09:53.920
got like freaking 10 kabillion.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.920
Right, thank you. Let's go for a job.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.920
Let me drink that. Let me eat.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.920
Oh, I love the little bubble

09:59.920 --> 10:01.920
sound effect. If I ever make a song,

10:01.920 --> 10:03.920
like an actual song, like custom made song,

10:03.920 --> 10:05.920
oh my god, 10,000 swordfish.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.920
Oh my gosh.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.920
Right, in order

10:15.920 --> 10:17.920
to make this super simple,

10:17.920 --> 10:19.920
I'm so sorry for anyone

10:19.920 --> 10:21.920
who like is really good at organizing their

10:21.920 --> 10:23.920
shit.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.920
I'm not. I'm literally just going to shove

10:25.920 --> 10:27.920
all the fish items to the top.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.920
Please don't judge me.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.920
Please don't judge me.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.920
Right, I'm pretty sure that's all the shit.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.920
Raw trout, you as well.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.920
Raw herring, you as well.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.920
And that's cooked salmon.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.920
God, what a bank.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.920
Gee willikers, I sure hope no one cracks

10:43.920 --> 10:45.920
into a skullfish.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.920
If you move to members later, it'll get

10:47.920 --> 10:49.920
faster. One morban, literally.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.920
Right, shrimp. We're going to

10:51.920 --> 10:53.920
call the shrimp right now. Unless the fire

10:53.920 --> 10:55.920
is out, I think the fire is out.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.920
Wait, no, someone's lighting the beacon.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.920
Gondor calls for aid.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.920
We're just going to clean up our inventory.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.920
I say that as if we didn't just get 10,000

11:03.920 --> 11:05.920
freaking fish. Thank you very much.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.920
Does me, I'm glad I could help.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.920
Thank you. Bank tabs and shambles.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.920
I'm so sorry. I know people are

11:11.920 --> 11:13.920
really good at organizing their tabs.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.920
I just couldn't, I'm just like, in and out.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.920
Let's go. She's a hoarder.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.920
But she's our hoarder.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.920
Visucky

11:21.920 --> 11:23.920
is done for. They can't compete with

11:23.920 --> 11:25.920
velour, literally.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.920
I bet you velour won't last until

11:27.920 --> 11:29.920
velour stuff exists in.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.920
Isn't it interesting?

11:31.920 --> 11:33.920
Look at me right now.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.920
Valia might only last

11:35.920 --> 11:37.920
two years, but that's still a year.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.920
22 months, 30

11:39.920 --> 11:41.920
days, 23 hours,

11:41.920 --> 11:43.920
59 minutes and 59

11:43.920 --> 11:45.920
seconds longer than he probably lasts

11:45.920 --> 11:47.920
when he touches a woman.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.920
Bro, literally, oh wait,

11:49.920 --> 11:51.920
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, did you just

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
did you just roast him?

11:53.920 --> 11:55.920
Thank you for the tip, Toria.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.920
I was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, until

11:57.920 --> 11:59.920
I heard the very last sentence.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.920
I was like, a Brian?

12:01.920 --> 12:03.920
Brian?

12:03.920 --> 12:05.920
Oh my gosh.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.920
That was,

12:07.920 --> 12:09.920
I didn't expect that at all.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.920
Right, I can put this away because there's a kind of rifle

12:11.920 --> 12:13.920
in making fires. Right.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.920
We'll do anchovies.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.920
We'll do

12:17.920 --> 12:19.920
the...

12:19.920 --> 12:21.920
No, don't eat. Oh wait, they're cooked.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.920
Okay.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.920
My apologies, such a fake gamer for

12:25.920 --> 12:27.920
I cannot, oh my god,

12:27.920 --> 12:29.920
really starting a freaking fire outside the bank.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.920
Wait a minute.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.920
I'm not the Rockwell uprising.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.920
Like, I was naughty.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.920
I'm not there all the time.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.920
I'll be honest, I'll put my hand up

12:39.920 --> 12:41.920
and I'll say I'm not there all the time.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.920
I had a little peek yesterday

12:43.920 --> 12:45.920
about what you've all been

12:45.920 --> 12:47.920
anonymously chatting about

12:47.920 --> 12:49.920
and someone said,

12:49.920 --> 12:51.920
yes, Trony, I understand

12:51.920 --> 12:53.920
Blackwell

12:53.920 --> 12:55.920
headquarters.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.920
And I was like,

12:57.920 --> 12:59.920
that's so fucking funny.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.920
So yeah, your comment got me excited.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.920
I was seeing someone,

13:03.920 --> 13:05.920
someone's like, a ritual

13:05.920 --> 13:07.920
posting about Shibi and it's like, I am nothing but trash.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.920
I'm just Shibi's foot and I'm like, yes, yes, yes.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.920
Then the OG

13:11.920 --> 13:13.920
Sons, those Czech and the OG Sons

13:13.920 --> 13:15.920
they were spoiling I see.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.920
Absolutely spoiling it.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.920
He's throwing it off topic question.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.920
What's your tip for Germany,

13:21.920 --> 13:23.920
Scotland today?

13:23.920 --> 13:25.920
Is there a football match on?

13:25.920 --> 13:27.920
Use logs on fire to make bonfire.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.920
We'll not go out.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.920
Isn't that all RuneScape 3?

13:31.920 --> 13:33.920
I don't think that's a thing here.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.920
What about having many fires?

13:35.920 --> 13:37.920
Hmm.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.920
Any thoughts on doing

13:39.920 --> 13:41.920
Iron Man so chat can't just give you everything?

13:41.920 --> 13:43.920
VBop

13:43.920 --> 13:45.920
You have far too much faith in me.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.920
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.920
I know I'm not supposed to

13:49.920 --> 13:51.920
name chatters

13:51.920 --> 13:53.920
but my guy

13:53.920 --> 13:55.920
you have far too much faith in me to think that I could do

13:55.920 --> 13:57.920
the only way I could do this on my own

13:57.920 --> 13:59.920
is by picking up

13:59.920 --> 14:01.920
dropped fish and barbarian village.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.920
That is the only way I know how to do it

14:03.920 --> 14:05.920
because I don't have the funds.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.920
I don't know how to make money in this game

14:07.920 --> 14:09.920
and we'd be at this for hours.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.920
Since strong debut,

14:15.920 --> 14:17.920
something about her reminded me of a Pokemon.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.920
It has been on the tip of my tongue

14:19.920 --> 14:21.920
for an entire week

14:21.920 --> 14:23.920
and I finally figured it looks like a

14:23.920 --> 14:25.920
Cray Dilly if it was an anime girl.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.920
A Cray Dilly?

14:27.920 --> 14:29.920
Hold on, you're actually getting me to look up something.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.920
Cray Dilly Pokemon.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.920
Cray Dilly Pokemon.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.920
Oh,

14:37.920 --> 14:39.920
I know them.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.920
They're in Ruby.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.920
Kill things to make money.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
Bro, goblins don't drop money.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.920
The most expensive item

14:47.920 --> 14:49.920
goblins drop is goblin mail

14:49.920 --> 14:51.920
which is 500 a piece purely because it's a quest item.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.920
Thank you Thierry for the other tip as well.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.920
Honestly, I could see that.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.920
Yeah, the fossil type.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.920
Goblins are the best.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.920
You're trolling me.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.920
I'm getting trolled.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.920
There's no way you guys actually think that.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.920
I got my first bond via marbles on stream.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.920
I wish you could do marbles on stream

15:13.920 --> 15:15.920
on

15:15.920 --> 15:17.920
thingy.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.920
On YouTube.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.920
But things are very slowly getting

15:21.920 --> 15:23.920
integrated to YouTube.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.920
But I

15:25.920 --> 15:27.920
definitely feel YouTube

15:27.920 --> 15:29.920
is becoming stronger and stronger

15:29.920 --> 15:31.920
for streamers.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.920
And like,

15:33.920 --> 15:35.920
I think what we're saying

15:35.920 --> 15:37.920
is that discoverability, who

15:37.920 --> 15:39.920
dare add it.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.920
DEMPA!

15:41.920 --> 15:43.920
I don't know if you're still lurking.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.920
DEMPA goes, I didn't think that far ahead.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.920
What do you think would be cute?

15:47.920 --> 15:49.920
I think she likes the kind of creature it is.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.920
I'll write some creepy stuff for you.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.920
You were strong and we were rooting for Scotland

15:53.920 --> 15:55.920
today in the years. Oh, we're gonna do shit.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.920
It's fine, it's fine.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.920
The life of a Scottish

15:59.920 --> 16:01.920
national...

16:01.920 --> 16:03.920
Wait, no, hold on.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.920
Nationality of a Scottish person.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.920
Because we understand we're just terrible.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.920
Although we're decent at rugby.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.920
I'll be honest, we're actually no rough at rugby.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.920
But the fit ball.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.920
The fit ball, if you didn't know

16:15.920 --> 16:17.920
football in Scotland,

16:17.920 --> 16:19.920
you say fit, like F-I-T.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.920
But no pronunciation on the T.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.920
And then ball, fit ball.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.920
Okay.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.920
I feel like

16:27.920 --> 16:29.920
YouTube could make discoverability so much better.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.920
See, I think it does

16:31.920 --> 16:33.920
enough. It's Twitch that has poor

16:33.920 --> 16:35.920
discoverability. However,

16:35.920 --> 16:37.920
people disagree with me when I say that.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.920
And I'm like, oh, okay.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.920
I actually thought

16:41.920 --> 16:43.920
Shawnee literally never leaves

16:43.920 --> 16:45.920
her arms until she makes

16:45.920 --> 16:47.920
her display.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.920
Born blue, thank you

16:49.920 --> 16:51.920
for becoming a member.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.920
Enjoy the emotes back.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.920
The girls emotes have been ordered.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.920
I do have a bit of bad news

16:57.920 --> 16:59.920
about it though. The person

16:59.920 --> 17:01.920
that I get them done by, they're like

17:01.920 --> 17:03.920
it'll take me a month. And I'm like

17:03.920 --> 17:05.920
excuse me?

17:05.920 --> 17:07.920
A month? And they're like, yeah, a month.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.920
Is that okay? And I'm like, hehe

17:09.920 --> 17:11.920
I guess.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.920
And then they're like, oh

17:13.920 --> 17:15.920
but we've also put the base price up.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.920
And I'm like, oh, okay then.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.920
Okay, that's fine then.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.920
And I'm like, okay.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
That's just kind of the worst of all worlds.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.920
But yeah.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.920
Everyone else

17:27.920 --> 17:29.920
is going to get emotes before me.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.920
I'm submitting everyone else's emotes before me because

17:31.920 --> 17:33.920
I don't think it's fair.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.920
My reeflings, you know how

17:35.920 --> 17:37.920
unbelievably

17:37.920 --> 17:39.920
well behaved you are for me and how patient.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.920
And it's nicer for the girls

17:41.920 --> 17:43.920
to have something to celebrate.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.920
Because you already know I'm going to be here

17:45.920 --> 17:47.920
every day.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.920
And

17:49.920 --> 17:51.920
Oh, I was saying that my first drunk stream

17:51.920 --> 17:53.920
I'm not sure how much people

17:53.920 --> 17:55.920
are going to like this. And I can already see

17:55.920 --> 17:57.920
some of you typing and rolling your

17:57.920 --> 17:59.920
eyes. Keep your eyes to the

17:59.920 --> 18:01.920
front of your head. I don't want one

18:01.920 --> 18:03.920
eye rolling to the back of the skull.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.920
Um

18:05.920 --> 18:07.920
What am I saying?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.920
Um

18:09.920 --> 18:11.920
My first drunk

18:11.920 --> 18:13.920
stream was going to be

18:13.920 --> 18:15.920
uh

18:15.920 --> 18:17.920
drunk apex but I don't go off

18:17.920 --> 18:19.920
line until we win.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.920
But okay.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.920
How did you time that?

18:23.920 --> 18:25.920
There's a stream delay. How did you even

18:25.920 --> 18:27.920
time that?

18:27.920 --> 18:29.920
Fucking reefling in game said

18:29.920 --> 18:31.920
eye roll. How did you time that?

18:31.920 --> 18:33.920
30

18:33.920 --> 18:35.920
ever stream. I well thought that

18:35.920 --> 18:37.920
but then I was like would you guys rather

18:37.920 --> 18:39.920
jellybean game? Some sort of drunk

18:39.920 --> 18:41.920
multiplayer game.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.920
So the stream is just never going to end pretty much.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.920
Apex. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.920
Everyone's like dunking on apex.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.920
Well, there's other multiplayer games

18:49.920 --> 18:51.920
we can play if you'd rather drunk

18:51.920 --> 18:53.920
that. But I feel like drunk jellybean

18:53.920 --> 18:55.920
is just going to be me like

18:55.920 --> 18:57.920
please, please,

18:57.920 --> 18:59.920
please let me, let me

18:59.920 --> 19:01.920
get to the past and first level

19:01.920 --> 19:03.920
please

19:03.920 --> 19:05.920
I don't want to spectate.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.920
Like and I'll be drunk and all that.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.920
Why is so much fire? You had drunk

19:09.920 --> 19:11.920
runes. How is drunk runescape fun?

19:11.920 --> 19:13.920
I

19:13.920 --> 19:15.920
put the shrimp on the

19:15.920 --> 19:17.920
fire

19:17.920 --> 19:19.920
it cooks the shrimp

19:19.920 --> 19:21.920
and my level

19:21.920 --> 19:23.920
gets higher

19:23.920 --> 19:25.920
drunk fire cave

19:25.920 --> 19:27.920
Oh

19:27.920 --> 19:29.920
got drunk. I accidentally achieved 99

19:29.920 --> 19:31.920
fletching

19:31.920 --> 19:33.920
runescape is never fun.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.920
You drink every time you make an alcoholic

19:35.920 --> 19:37.920
drink.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.920
We won't let you get past level one

19:39.920 --> 19:41.920
this time around.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.920
That's what I'm worried about

19:43.920 --> 19:45.920
the true endurance stream for real

19:45.920 --> 19:47.920
for real. We'll bank the bank

19:47.920 --> 19:49.920
runescape is a job

19:49.920 --> 19:51.920
Honestly, that's funny.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.920
Oh wait, no, that's kitchener

19:53.920 --> 19:55.920
but you're

19:55.920 --> 19:57.920
un-cook-trure herring.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.920
Castle wars is

19:59.920 --> 20:01.920
for you play. Right, hydration. I need

20:01.920 --> 20:03.920
to finish my tea.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.920
which

20:11.920 --> 20:13.920
yes

20:13.920 --> 20:15.920
I

20:15.920 --> 20:17.920
I've also planned

20:17.920 --> 20:19.920
out the membership

20:19.920 --> 20:21.920
streams for next week. Again

20:21.920 --> 20:23.920
if you are unable to member, please don't

20:23.920 --> 20:25.920
worry

20:25.920 --> 20:27.920
dear little reeflings, I stream

20:27.920 --> 20:29.920
every single day free access

20:31.920 --> 20:33.920
What movie did I pick?

20:33.920 --> 20:35.920
I think I might have picked

20:35.920 --> 20:37.920
Austin Powers

20:37.920 --> 20:39.920
for the movie

20:39.920 --> 20:41.920
question mark. How are you keeping this

20:41.920 --> 20:43.920
up?

20:43.920 --> 20:45.920
I don't know. I thought you could only have one

20:47.920 --> 20:49.920
or she'll start leaking secret.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.920
No, I shut off about all the insider stuff

20:51.920 --> 20:53.920
now. I'm starting to

20:53.920 --> 20:55.920
leak it. Well, I've not said anything

20:55.920 --> 20:57.920
that I regret saying. I don't

20:57.920 --> 20:59.920
regret being like, yeah

20:59.920 --> 21:01.920
we don't need talent managers

21:01.920 --> 21:03.920
because it turns out if you give

21:03.920 --> 21:05.920
actually I will like to expand

21:05.920 --> 21:07.920
upon that point. Now that you've got me

21:07.920 --> 21:09.920
on that subject, hold on a minute little reefling

21:09.920 --> 21:11.920
the reason

21:11.920 --> 21:13.920
why talent managers aren't necessarily

21:13.920 --> 21:15.920
needed is because these girls

21:15.920 --> 21:17.920
have streamed and they have plenty of

21:17.920 --> 21:19.920
experience. Who goes there

21:19.920 --> 21:21.920
and

21:21.920 --> 21:23.920
to

21:23.920 --> 21:25.920
go from

21:25.920 --> 21:27.920
independent where you pick your streams

21:27.920 --> 21:29.920
and you pick everything and then

21:29.920 --> 21:31.920
you're on a one week basis where you need

21:31.920 --> 21:33.920
approval every week to stream what you want

21:33.920 --> 21:35.920
it just doesn't make sense or it doesn't make

21:35.920 --> 21:37.920
sense to me. Okay, so

21:37.920 --> 21:39.920
yeah

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
sad I'm going to miss the first membership stream

21:41.920 --> 21:43.920
I mean you can always go back and watch the vods

21:43.920 --> 21:45.920
at any point you become

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
a member you can access the

21:47.920 --> 21:49.920
vods on the membership

21:49.920 --> 21:51.920
strums. I just need to

21:51.920 --> 21:53.920
once I make

21:53.920 --> 21:55.920
the lobbies for them

21:55.920 --> 21:57.920
I just need to make sure I do it for the correct

21:57.920 --> 21:59.920
membership here

21:59.920 --> 22:01.920
and holy crap we're creeping on the next level

22:01.920 --> 22:03.920
I actually don't know what level we are

22:03.920 --> 22:05.920
we're level 52 we're about to be

22:05.920 --> 22:07.920
53 we're like slowly creeping up

22:09.920 --> 22:11.920
wait are they flirting what's going on here

22:11.920 --> 22:13.920
agility, construction

22:13.920 --> 22:15.920
and slayer

22:15.920 --> 22:17.920
oh we're all debating on what I thought

22:17.920 --> 22:19.920
runecrafting was unanimously voted the worst

22:19.920 --> 22:21.920
it's been stressful

22:21.920 --> 22:23.920
with a manager I just

22:23.920 --> 22:25.920
feel very strongly that

22:25.920 --> 22:27.920
I mean

22:27.920 --> 22:29.920
obviously in my instance

22:29.920 --> 22:31.920
the girls in that are happy for me to say

22:31.920 --> 22:33.920
all of them streamed way longer than me

22:33.920 --> 22:35.920
why would they need to come

22:35.920 --> 22:37.920
to me for permission to stream

22:37.920 --> 22:39.920
it just seems rather odd

22:39.920 --> 22:41.920
you know

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
just doesn't make any sense

22:45.920 --> 22:47.920
runecrafting has a minigame now

22:47.920 --> 22:49.920
all to make it faster

22:51.920 --> 22:53.920
I'm thinking of

22:53.920 --> 22:55.920
how many watch hours I need to stack up

22:55.920 --> 22:57.920
when I get home though honestly though

22:57.920 --> 22:59.920
I've

22:59.920 --> 23:01.920
planned out

23:01.920 --> 23:03.920
the

23:03.920 --> 23:05.920
Elden Ring streams

23:07.920 --> 23:09.920
but

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
I just realised I might have to delay it by a day

23:11.920 --> 23:13.920
because of time zones I don't know

23:13.920 --> 23:15.920
if the DLC has a time zone release

23:15.920 --> 23:17.920
but from being

23:17.920 --> 23:19.920
an upside down land

23:19.920 --> 23:21.920
whenever there's an ad for a game

23:21.920 --> 23:23.920
and it's like this game comes out on this day

23:23.920 --> 23:25.920
I'm like well that's a lie

23:25.920 --> 23:27.920
it's not like time synced

23:29.920 --> 23:31.920
because I'm in the future

23:31.920 --> 23:33.920
right now I'm in the future it's 4am on the 15th

23:33.920 --> 23:35.920
like I'm in the future you know

23:37.920 --> 23:39.920
so I might have accidentally planned

23:39.920 --> 23:41.920
my Elden Ring stream a day too early

23:41.920 --> 23:43.920
before the DLC comes out

23:43.920 --> 23:45.920
but then again

23:45.920 --> 23:47.920
we could play it

23:47.920 --> 23:49.920
early

23:49.920 --> 23:51.920
actually no it's not going to be a problem

23:51.920 --> 23:53.920
because we're not even going to be able to be at the DLC

23:53.920 --> 23:55.920
because we're starting fresh

23:55.920 --> 23:57.920
how's the future

23:57.920 --> 23:59.920
I mean

23:59.920 --> 24:01.920
it's alright

24:01.920 --> 24:03.920
I ain't got much of a quarrel with it

24:05.920 --> 24:07.920
that's a lot of marks of grace

24:07.920 --> 24:09.920
yes

24:09.920 --> 24:11.920
that's going to be a major endurance stream

24:11.920 --> 24:13.920
back to back

24:13.920 --> 24:15.920
I've planned 4 days

24:15.920 --> 24:17.920
around it

24:17.920 --> 24:19.920
it might leak into a 5th day

24:19.920 --> 24:21.920
so sorry to anyone watching that

24:21.920 --> 24:23.920
the Elden Ring isn't your thing

24:23.920 --> 24:25.920
you know

24:25.920 --> 24:27.920
arise you tarnish

24:29.920 --> 24:31.920
do you have a save file already

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
no I was going to start fresh

24:33.920 --> 24:35.920
I was going to start from the beginning

24:35.920 --> 24:37.920
yeah because I like when you guys

24:37.920 --> 24:39.920
get to hold my hand

24:39.920 --> 24:41.920
so the stream

24:41.920 --> 24:43.920
and someone sent a marshmallow

24:43.920 --> 24:45.920
and I was like can we invade

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
and I'm like that's actually what we do

24:47.920 --> 24:49.920
so 2 reeflings come in

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
as an invader or enemy

24:51.920 --> 24:53.920
and it means we can safely walk around

24:53.920 --> 24:55.920
the areas and stuff

24:55.920 --> 24:57.920
I didn't know if I should bring out the shock collar

24:57.920 --> 24:59.920
so every time I perish

24:59.920 --> 25:01.920
you guys get to shock me

25:01.920 --> 25:03.920
I don't know if that's a bit too weird though

25:03.920 --> 25:05.920
for what we're...

25:05.920 --> 25:07.920
I feel like it's more going to be like nostalgia run

25:07.920 --> 25:09.920
of like all of us being like I remember this

25:09.920 --> 25:11.920
I remember that I remember when we did this

25:11.920 --> 25:13.920
remember when we did that

25:13.920 --> 25:15.920
and then I've just got a shock collar going

25:15.920 --> 25:17.920
me every time

25:17.920 --> 25:19.920
every time I mess up

25:19.920 --> 25:21.920
ummm

25:21.920 --> 25:23.920
we know what I hurt you

25:23.920 --> 25:25.920
I will probably be on here runescape

25:25.920 --> 25:27.920
and during that oh I need to finish my teeth

25:27.920 --> 25:29.920
they're cold

25:33.920 --> 25:35.920
I've been making my

25:35.920 --> 25:37.920
teeth with far too much honey

25:37.920 --> 25:39.920
it's rubbish

25:39.920 --> 25:41.920
alcohol poisoning no I cannot

25:41.920 --> 25:43.920
I cannot drink and play runescape

25:43.920 --> 25:45.920
Elden rings there's no chance of that

25:45.920 --> 25:47.920
the shock collar is

25:47.920 --> 25:49.920
with sin I actually need to mess with her

25:49.920 --> 25:51.920
because unfortunately

25:51.920 --> 25:53.920
I need to delay that stream due to

25:53.920 --> 25:55.920
obligations

25:57.920 --> 25:59.920
because essentially week 3

25:59.920 --> 26:01.920
is Elden Ring and then it would be week 4

26:01.920 --> 26:03.920
Elden Ring with sin and

26:03.920 --> 26:05.920
I think that would

26:05.920 --> 26:07.920
alienate

26:07.920 --> 26:09.920
too many

26:09.920 --> 26:11.920
supporters being like oh god

26:11.920 --> 26:13.920
get off that game already

26:13.920 --> 26:15.920
you can do it

26:15.920 --> 26:17.920
don't let you get in the way

26:17.920 --> 26:19.920
don't let yourself get in the way

26:19.920 --> 26:21.920
honestly

26:21.920 --> 26:23.920
I do have a fun update for those of you

26:23.920 --> 26:25.920
who enjoy seeing my hands

26:25.920 --> 26:27.920
I have successfully ordered

26:27.920 --> 26:29.920
the Uwu Market

26:29.920 --> 26:31.920
keychains

26:31.920 --> 26:33.920
and merchandise

26:33.920 --> 26:35.920
like I bought my own merchandise

26:35.920 --> 26:37.920
type thing but I got a discount code

26:37.920 --> 26:39.920
and all that I've got the keychains

26:39.920 --> 26:41.920
of all the girls coming

26:41.920 --> 26:43.920
so I'm going to do

26:43.920 --> 26:45.920
like a little hand ASMR soon

26:45.920 --> 26:47.920
for anyone

26:47.920 --> 26:49.920
now don't worry this content

26:49.920 --> 26:51.920
will be made public that I'm about to discuss

26:51.920 --> 26:53.920
for anyone who is currently

26:53.920 --> 26:55.920
on Patreon

26:55.920 --> 26:57.920
they got early access to

26:57.920 --> 26:59.920
a YouTube video

26:59.920 --> 27:01.920
which was absolutely outrageous

27:01.920 --> 27:03.920
but I'm just wanting to

27:03.920 --> 27:05.920
know if anyone in chat

27:05.920 --> 27:07.920
did listen to that outrageous

27:07.920 --> 27:09.920
audio and what were your thoughts about it

27:09.920 --> 27:11.920
um

27:11.920 --> 27:13.920
I'm also using my Patreon

27:13.920 --> 27:15.920
as a

27:15.920 --> 27:17.920
big archive of anything that I produce

27:17.920 --> 27:19.920
sadly

27:19.920 --> 27:21.920
4 audios are unable to be

27:21.920 --> 27:23.920
uploaded to it because I was

27:23.920 --> 27:25.920
very dumb

27:25.920 --> 27:27.920
I've made a 4 part

27:27.920 --> 27:29.920
series

27:29.920 --> 27:31.920
that has hypnosis

27:31.920 --> 27:33.920
in it but Patreon actually doesn't allow

27:33.920 --> 27:35.920
that

27:35.920 --> 27:37.920
so I'm going to upload it on my

27:37.920 --> 27:39.920
Twitter for free not a problem

27:39.920 --> 27:41.920
I just need to edit it and get out of the way

27:41.920 --> 27:43.920
but it means

27:43.920 --> 27:45.920
I'm now missing 4 audios

27:45.920 --> 27:47.920
um

27:47.920 --> 27:49.920
raw tuna

27:49.920 --> 27:51.920
that's cooked that's cooked that's cooked

27:51.920 --> 27:53.920
that's cooked so

27:53.920 --> 27:55.920
Lobster's tuna and then we tackle

27:55.920 --> 27:57.920
the 10k freaking

27:57.920 --> 27:59.920
swordfish

27:59.920 --> 28:01.920
this is going to be interesting

28:01.920 --> 28:03.920
I keep running out of love

28:03.920 --> 28:05.920
um

28:05.920 --> 28:07.920
the hoodies

28:07.920 --> 28:09.920
no nothing is limited by Ubu Market

28:09.920 --> 28:11.920
um

28:11.920 --> 28:13.920
actually I need to talk to them again

28:13.920 --> 28:15.920
because

28:15.920 --> 28:17.920
Azura is coming up

28:17.920 --> 28:19.920
um

28:19.920 --> 28:21.920
y'all

28:21.920 --> 28:23.920
why does he not like hypnosis

28:23.920 --> 28:25.920
Mastercard

28:25.920 --> 28:27.920
our unloved overlords

28:27.920 --> 28:29.920
have deemed that

28:29.920 --> 28:31.920
hypnosis isn't

28:31.920 --> 28:33.920
consensual for some reason

28:33.920 --> 28:35.920
even though it fully is like you will never

28:35.920 --> 28:37.920
do something that you don't want to do

28:37.920 --> 28:39.920
um

28:39.920 --> 28:41.920
and unfortunately

28:41.920 --> 28:43.920
Patreon always have to bend the knee

28:43.920 --> 28:45.920
a lot of people have issues with Patreon

28:45.920 --> 28:47.920
but the reality of the situation is

28:47.920 --> 28:49.920
our overlords that we despise

28:49.920 --> 28:51.920
the ones who are on Epstein Island

28:51.920 --> 28:53.920
all the time

28:53.920 --> 28:55.920
but deem hypnosis as non consensual

28:55.920 --> 28:57.920
so it cannot be

28:57.920 --> 28:59.920
uploaded to Patreon however

28:59.920 --> 29:01.920
um

29:01.920 --> 29:03.920
I'm going to say something and this is a bit controversial

29:03.920 --> 29:05.920
but guess what

29:05.920 --> 29:07.920
Elon Musk announced that Twitter is absolutely

29:07.920 --> 29:09.920
fine with that kind of content

29:09.920 --> 29:11.920
so I'm sorry but one up on Elon

29:11.920 --> 29:13.920
Musk because he couldn't give less of a rat's

29:13.920 --> 29:15.920
arse and to be honest

29:15.920 --> 29:17.920
that's kind of what I'm looking for when it comes to

29:17.920 --> 29:19.920
just making content

29:19.920 --> 29:21.920
we're all adults here we're all doing our thing

29:21.920 --> 29:23.920
like there's no need for

29:23.920 --> 29:25.920
all these things going on

29:25.920 --> 29:27.920
uh

29:27.920 --> 29:29.920
but yeah

29:29.920 --> 29:31.920
uh

29:31.920 --> 29:33.920
yes um so unfortunately

29:33.920 --> 29:35.920
it means I have four missing loot

29:35.920 --> 29:37.920
oh I shouldn't say those words

29:37.920 --> 29:39.920
sorry four inkable

29:39.920 --> 29:41.920
audios so I need to go

29:41.920 --> 29:43.920
like record so

29:43.920 --> 29:45.920
I'm not actually sure what my

29:45.920 --> 29:47.920
fourth upload this month is going to be on Patreon

29:47.920 --> 29:49.920
because

29:49.920 --> 29:51.920
um

29:51.920 --> 29:53.920
originally it was supposed to be

29:53.920 --> 29:55.920
a part one of this series

29:55.920 --> 29:57.920
but it's not possible

29:57.920 --> 29:59.920
um

29:59.920 --> 30:01.920
yes

30:01.920 --> 30:03.920
yes

30:03.920 --> 30:05.920
um but yeah did you like the audio

30:05.920 --> 30:07.920
for those of you who are on Patreon

30:07.920 --> 30:09.920
because it was absolutely outrageous

30:09.920 --> 30:11.920
you can probably monetize twitter eventually

30:11.920 --> 30:13.920
oh you need

30:13.920 --> 30:15.920
five million impressions I'm not sure we're there

30:15.920 --> 30:17.920
unless like well she

30:17.920 --> 30:19.920
stares

30:19.920 --> 30:21.920
and Mercy

30:21.920 --> 30:23.920
managed to get caught in the algorithm

30:23.920 --> 30:25.920
when

30:25.920 --> 30:27.920
this new meta came up

30:27.920 --> 30:29.920
so they actually probably do

30:29.920 --> 30:31.920
have that

30:31.920 --> 30:33.920
um

30:33.920 --> 30:35.920
but uh

30:35.920 --> 30:37.920
yeah like if twitter is like

30:37.920 --> 30:39.920
oh I burnt all of them

30:39.920 --> 30:41.920
I have five

30:41.920 --> 30:43.920
lobbies out of that that's terrible

30:43.920 --> 30:45.920
ooh

30:45.920 --> 30:47.920
that was a really rough run right lobbies

30:47.920 --> 30:49.920
we've got 500

30:49.920 --> 30:51.920
let's see how much we just absolutely

30:51.920 --> 30:53.920
waste honestly

30:53.920 --> 30:55.920
I'll do the camera and go like that

30:55.920 --> 30:57.920
eh

30:57.920 --> 30:59.920
it was very unhinged that ASMR

30:59.920 --> 31:01.920
yeah

31:01.920 --> 31:03.920
I thought it was hilarious I was like

31:03.920 --> 31:05.920
freaking jumping around the mic

31:05.920 --> 31:07.920
I was doing like backflips trying to like

31:07.920 --> 31:09.920
come over and like get it louder and stuff

31:09.920 --> 31:11.920
do you know how many I put so many

31:11.920 --> 31:13.920
like noise dampening filters

31:13.920 --> 31:15.920
on the audio as well

31:15.920 --> 31:17.920
but the clap was so loud

31:17.920 --> 31:19.920
it was outrageous

31:19.920 --> 31:21.920
um

31:21.920 --> 31:23.920
I don't know if it'll survive on youtube

31:23.920 --> 31:25.920
but I'll still upload it as a yolo anyway

31:25.920 --> 31:27.920
cause it's hilarious and I don't care

31:27.920 --> 31:29.920
and to be honest

31:29.920 --> 31:31.920
I never really did anything that outrageous

31:31.920 --> 31:33.920
cause it's just sound like to me it's like

31:33.920 --> 31:35.920
just the sound of someone clapping their hands

31:35.920 --> 31:37.920
okay it's just what's actually

31:37.920 --> 31:39.920
happening that's a bit outrageous

31:39.920 --> 31:41.920
but because there's no audio it's fain

31:41.920 --> 31:43.920
eh so because

31:43.920 --> 31:45.920
there's no visual unhinged

31:45.920 --> 31:47.920
isn't a negative thing

31:47.920 --> 31:49.920
the audio is the reason

31:49.920 --> 31:51.920
eh

31:51.920 --> 31:53.920
I'll have to go stuff to see the

31:53.920 --> 31:55.920
7th grade

31:55.920 --> 31:57.920
yeah basically I did clapping ASMR

31:57.920 --> 31:59.920
but I didn't use my

31:59.920 --> 32:01.920
hands

32:01.920 --> 32:03.920
I wonder

32:03.920 --> 32:05.920
well I'm gonna see if I can get some fish

32:05.920 --> 32:07.920
I don't need any more fish if it's for me

32:07.920 --> 32:09.920
I'm sure you've got 10k swordfish

32:11.920 --> 32:13.920
um but yeah

32:13.920 --> 32:15.920
that's the audio I made

32:15.920 --> 32:17.920
oh my god we've almost leveled up again

32:19.920 --> 32:21.920
54

32:21.920 --> 32:23.920
that's fantastic

32:23.920 --> 32:25.920
what a genius entrepreneur truly

32:27.920 --> 32:29.920
I fell asleep to the begging one

32:29.920 --> 32:31.920
really?

32:31.920 --> 32:33.920
that was so popular

32:33.920 --> 32:35.920
I definitely hit the algorithm

32:35.920 --> 32:37.920
because

32:37.920 --> 32:39.920
well someone said on one of my

32:39.920 --> 32:41.920
ASMR stream

32:41.920 --> 32:43.920
wait what happened there

32:43.920 --> 32:45.920
someone said on my ASMR stream

32:45.920 --> 32:47.920
that

32:47.920 --> 32:49.920
I was on tiktok

32:49.920 --> 32:51.920
feature page

32:51.920 --> 32:53.920
but um

32:53.920 --> 32:55.920
vealer doesn't upload to tiktok

32:55.920 --> 32:57.920
we've reserved everyone's name on tiktok

32:57.920 --> 32:59.920
just in case

32:59.920 --> 33:01.920
but it's more important to do youtube

33:01.920 --> 33:03.920
shorts vs tiktok

33:03.920 --> 33:05.920
like over that kind of thing

33:05.920 --> 33:07.920
um

33:07.920 --> 33:09.920
what liquid you put on your

33:09.920 --> 33:11.920
not hands I heard you spray something

33:11.920 --> 33:13.920
at the beginning

33:13.920 --> 33:15.920
oh it's coconut oil

33:15.920 --> 33:17.920
it's oil

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
in the audio

33:19.920 --> 33:21.920
you can hear me take off my prel

33:21.920 --> 33:23.920
I left that in on purpose

33:23.920 --> 33:25.920
because I breathed

33:25.920 --> 33:27.920
heavily through it and I was like

33:27.920 --> 33:29.920
I'll edit this out but then I was like

33:29.920 --> 33:31.920
oh maybe someone would enjoy it

33:31.920 --> 33:33.920
so I just left it in

33:33.920 --> 33:35.920
so you can literally hear me take off my weapon drew

33:35.920 --> 33:37.920
an armor

33:37.920 --> 33:39.920
nudge nudge

33:41.920 --> 33:43.920
tiktok clippers

33:43.920 --> 33:45.920
no like um so on tiktok

33:45.920 --> 33:47.920
it's called

33:47.920 --> 33:49.920
a video format it's called tiktok

33:49.920 --> 33:51.920
whereas youtube it's called a short

33:51.920 --> 33:53.920
and twitch it's a clip

33:53.920 --> 33:55.920
but it's all the same thing

33:55.920 --> 33:57.920
oh I leveled up I got

33:57.920 --> 33:59.920
54 oh my gosh

33:59.920 --> 34:01.920
maybe 78 is gonna be

34:01.920 --> 34:03.920
like way before like at the rate

34:03.920 --> 34:05.920
we're doing these lobbies

34:07.920 --> 34:09.920
um coconut

34:09.920 --> 34:11.920
my beloved

34:11.920 --> 34:13.920
ah thank you

34:13.920 --> 34:15.920
um oh my god that voice crack

34:15.920 --> 34:17.920
70 is fast yeah I feel like maybe

34:17.920 --> 34:19.920
I might have

34:19.920 --> 34:21.920
underestimated how much we're gonna get

34:23.920 --> 34:25.920
the little extra sounds add a lot

34:25.920 --> 34:27.920
oh right so I can actually tell you

34:27.920 --> 34:29.920
the behind the scenes of recording the coconut clapping

34:29.920 --> 34:31.920
let's call it the coconut clapping

34:31.920 --> 34:33.920
that'll be our code word for it

34:33.920 --> 34:35.920
um so

34:35.920 --> 34:37.920
the reason why you hear me go

34:37.920 --> 34:39.920
oh and then

34:39.920 --> 34:41.920
I do it is because I had to hold on

34:41.920 --> 34:43.920
to my

34:43.920 --> 34:45.920
my gooblies because they were

34:45.920 --> 34:47.920
bumping

34:47.920 --> 34:49.920
and jumping because of like

34:49.920 --> 34:51.920
in order to make

34:51.920 --> 34:53.920
um your buns of steel

34:53.920 --> 34:55.920
clap you have to like go up and down

34:55.920 --> 34:57.920
quite not violently

34:57.920 --> 34:59.920
but you have to make it quite fast that's something

34:59.920 --> 35:01.920
sometimes I do it slowly and then sometimes

35:01.920 --> 35:03.920
it's like one after

35:03.920 --> 35:05.920
what I'd clap that coconut

35:05.920 --> 35:07.920
I mean what the cool thing

35:07.920 --> 35:09.920
is that you can fully unleash the Scottish accent

35:09.920 --> 35:11.920
does that mean it tastes like coconut

35:11.920 --> 35:13.920
I mean right now probably

35:13.920 --> 35:15.920
oh I should do that smell trend

35:15.920 --> 35:17.920
I keep forgetting coconut clapping

35:17.920 --> 35:19.920
like want to bite them

35:19.920 --> 35:21.920
if you cook at a range next to where you're burning

35:21.920 --> 35:23.920
ah I can't be bothered moving though

35:23.920 --> 35:25.920
I want to stay with my reeflings at the fire

35:25.920 --> 35:27.920
I was gone for five just strong

35:27.920 --> 35:29.920
he died no I'm level

35:29.920 --> 35:31.920
54 we've

35:31.920 --> 35:33.920
just came to realize I've probably

35:33.920 --> 35:35.920
severely underestimated that we're

35:35.920 --> 35:37.920
achieved 70 this stream

35:37.920 --> 35:39.920
we are most likely going to have

35:39.920 --> 35:41.920
a lot more than that

35:41.920 --> 35:43.920
um

35:43.920 --> 35:45.920
aggressively clapping coconut

35:45.920 --> 35:47.920
well at one minute I was like I feel like

35:47.920 --> 35:49.920
um saw

35:49.920 --> 35:51.920
I think I said saw but what I meant was

35:51.920 --> 35:53.920
jaws that shark like that din din

35:53.920 --> 35:55.920
cause I was away I went

35:55.920 --> 35:57.920
walked further away from the microphone

35:57.920 --> 35:59.920
and then came closer and it was like

35:59.920 --> 36:01.920
din din din din clap clap

36:01.920 --> 36:03.920
din din din clap clap clap clap

36:03.920 --> 36:05.920
this is one of the most ridiculous

36:05.920 --> 36:07.920
audios I've ever made but

36:07.920 --> 36:09.920
I got halfway

36:09.920 --> 36:11.920
through editing my

36:11.920 --> 36:13.920
first

36:13.920 --> 36:15.920
1k thank you

36:15.920 --> 36:17.920
oh wait I've got salmon sugar

36:17.920 --> 36:19.920
I didn't notice that salmon there

36:19.920 --> 36:21.920
wait I'll finish off the salmon

36:21.920 --> 36:23.920
um

36:23.920 --> 36:25.920
I got halfway through

36:25.920 --> 36:27.920
finishing my first like 1000

36:27.920 --> 36:29.920
special ASMR

36:29.920 --> 36:31.920
and it's just me rambling

36:31.920 --> 36:33.920
in dune tingles it honestly

36:33.920 --> 36:35.920
probably feels like a live stream like

36:35.920 --> 36:37.920
when I just start rambling whilst I'm doing tingles

36:37.920 --> 36:39.920
but like I was having so much fun

36:39.920 --> 36:41.920
like

36:41.920 --> 36:43.920
being like guess what this is

36:43.920 --> 36:45.920
oh my god this is actually a sponge I don't know

36:45.920 --> 36:47.920
if you could guess that type thing like I was

36:47.920 --> 36:49.920
just getting so excited so it doesn't

36:49.920 --> 36:51.920
sound like ASMR again

36:51.920 --> 36:53.920
from the aster

36:53.920 --> 36:55.920
tuber

36:55.920 --> 36:57.920
I like 92 is halfway to

36:57.920 --> 36:59.920
99 XP wise

36:59.920 --> 37:01.920
hey oh dear lord

37:01.920 --> 37:03.920
this is going to take a little cheeky while

37:03.920 --> 37:05.920
um

37:05.920 --> 37:07.920
hi hello thank you for joining

37:07.920 --> 37:09.920
don't worry 70 isn't even halfway at 99

37:09.920 --> 37:11.920
hmm

37:11.920 --> 37:13.920
well I wanted to try and finish it

37:13.920 --> 37:15.920
in this month because I had on week

37:15.920 --> 37:17.920
4 I had 2 back to back

37:17.920 --> 37:19.920
runescape and I picked

37:19.920 --> 37:21.920
the movies I'm like 99%

37:21.920 --> 37:23.920
sure we're doing John Wick

37:23.920 --> 37:25.920
all of

37:25.920 --> 37:27.920
John Wick series

37:27.920 --> 37:29.920
um

37:29.920 --> 37:31.920
as if I burnt a singular

37:31.920 --> 37:33.920
salmon

37:33.920 --> 37:35.920
eh we'll do all of John Wick

38:09.920 --> 38:11.920
fan page bebble pales was

38:11.920 --> 38:13.920
hilarious I can't remember it wasn't bebble pales was it

38:13.920 --> 38:15.920
oh no it was pebble pales or something

38:15.920 --> 38:17.920
it was absolutely hilarious

38:17.920 --> 38:19.920
um I remember

38:19.920 --> 38:21.920
being like

38:21.920 --> 38:23.920
she said what out loud when she said

38:23.920 --> 38:25.920
that I was absolutely he ho in

38:25.920 --> 38:27.920
um

38:27.920 --> 38:29.920
but then she couldn't keep the fan name

38:29.920 --> 38:31.920
and I'm like it is probably for the better

38:31.920 --> 38:33.920
people but you're absolutely hilarious

38:33.920 --> 38:35.920
please do not change

38:35.920 --> 38:37.920
um

38:37.920 --> 38:39.920

I won't tell you

38:49.920 --> 38:51.920
um

38:51.920 --> 38:53.920
but yeah literally

38:53.920 --> 38:55.920
it was hilarious

38:55.920 --> 38:57.920
isn't that what everyone jokes about

38:57.920 --> 38:59.920
pippa they're like oh pippa such a headache

38:59.920 --> 39:01.920
for her manager

39:01.920 --> 39:03.920
how is self management treating you

39:03.920 --> 39:05.920
delicious I don't have to do anything

39:05.920 --> 39:07.920
literally the girl

39:07.920 --> 39:09.920
as far as I'm aware the girls are happy

39:09.920 --> 39:11.920
they can pick what they want do what they want

39:11.920 --> 39:13.920
um unfortunately

39:13.920 --> 39:15.920
because

39:15.920 --> 39:17.920
Azura and

39:17.920 --> 39:19.920
Emmy are on a warning

39:19.920 --> 39:21.920
um

39:21.920 --> 39:23.920
by juicy youtube thanks to their

39:23.920 --> 39:25.920
hidden ASMR update gameplays

39:25.920 --> 39:27.920
um

39:27.920 --> 39:29.920
I am, did I say thank you for the tip

39:29.920 --> 39:31.920
and on this

39:31.920 --> 39:33.920
thank you for your tip

39:33.920 --> 39:35.920
um

39:35.920 --> 39:37.920
oh

39:37.920 --> 39:39.920
unfortunately I've not

39:39.920 --> 39:41.920
well I've kind of discouraged them

39:41.920 --> 39:43.920
for doing ASMR until the warning is up

39:43.920 --> 39:45.920
because it's very dangerous

39:45.920 --> 39:47.920
if they get a strike

39:47.920 --> 39:49.920
I'm like brav

39:49.920 --> 39:51.920
YouTube please

39:51.920 --> 39:53.920
I'm back

39:53.920 --> 39:55.920
I got distracted oh don't worry

39:55.920 --> 39:57.920
I'm literally here for 12 hours

39:57.920 --> 39:59.920
don't worry we're doing an endurance today

39:59.920 --> 40:01.920
I have had so many short streams

40:01.920 --> 40:03.920
this week it felt so weird

40:03.920 --> 40:05.920
like

40:05.920 --> 40:07.920
I do have a lot of time to like finally start editing

40:07.920 --> 40:09.920
I have a heck of a lot

40:09.920 --> 40:11.920
of VTuber ASMR collabs

40:11.920 --> 40:13.920
coming through I wrote an ASMR

40:13.920 --> 40:15.920
collab for two of the girls

40:15.920 --> 40:17.920
and they all were together

40:17.920 --> 40:19.920
um

40:19.920 --> 40:21.920
and

40:21.920 --> 40:23.920
the girls

40:23.920 --> 40:25.920
one of them reacted and thought the plot

40:25.920 --> 40:27.920
was adorable

40:27.920 --> 40:29.920
it's just super basic short plot

40:29.920 --> 40:31.920
I never want to overwhelm the girls

40:31.920 --> 40:33.920
with anything that I assign them

40:33.920 --> 40:35.920
so please don't think it's like some super mega

40:35.920 --> 40:37.920
do do do do do

40:37.920 --> 40:39.920
I know

40:39.920 --> 40:41.920
that there is a collab with Mercy

40:41.920 --> 40:43.920
that's both audio and

40:43.920 --> 40:45.920
we get to play Goose Game tomorrow

40:45.920 --> 40:47.920
not tomorrow

40:47.920 --> 40:49.920
not tomorrow next week

40:49.920 --> 40:51.920
next week

40:51.920 --> 40:53.920
I am going to play RuneScape

40:53.920 --> 40:55.920
before it because

40:55.920 --> 40:57.920
I am going to stream on

40:57.920 --> 40:59.920
Mercy's time zone

40:59.920 --> 41:01.920
like when she normally streams

41:01.920 --> 41:03.920
so basically we're going to play

41:03.920 --> 41:05.920
RuneScape for a solid

41:05.920 --> 41:07.920
chunk and then I'm going to go offline

41:07.920 --> 41:09.920
and rest my voice for like an hour

41:09.920 --> 41:11.920
or two

41:11.920 --> 41:13.920
hours because I'll be in voice call

41:13.920 --> 41:15.920
with Mercy one hour before

41:15.920 --> 41:17.920
the collab if you didn't know

41:17.920 --> 41:19.920
it is common courtesy for VTubers

41:19.920 --> 41:21.920
to show up one hour before

41:21.920 --> 41:23.920
a collab which is where you

41:23.920 --> 41:25.920
do all of your

41:25.920 --> 41:27.920
um technical

41:27.920 --> 41:29.920
failures as I had with

41:29.920 --> 41:31.920
flipping

41:31.920 --> 41:33.920
again special shout out to

41:33.920 --> 41:35.920
Shibi for keeping my head on my shoulders

41:35.920 --> 41:37.920
I was panicking when

41:37.920 --> 41:39.920
we could not do it up

41:39.920 --> 41:41.920
and

41:41.920 --> 41:43.920
she's grinding so fast

41:43.920 --> 41:45.920
baby won't you

41:45.920 --> 41:47.920
grind on me

41:47.920 --> 41:49.920
relax your mind

41:49.920 --> 41:51.920
church your time

41:51.920 --> 41:53.920
will move

41:53.920 --> 41:55.920
that's all I know of that song

41:55.920 --> 41:57.920
I got one cake carambua

41:57.920 --> 41:59.920
of the pussy

41:59.920 --> 42:01.920
wow

42:01.920 --> 42:03.920
when you start cooking members food

42:03.920 --> 42:05.920
I have like

42:05.920 --> 42:07.920
10,000 swordfish to go through

42:07.920 --> 42:09.920
I have no idea what even potential

42:09.920 --> 42:11.920
XP that might is

42:11.920 --> 42:13.920
that might is okay

42:13.920 --> 42:15.920
well one you're done what English was that

42:19.920 --> 42:21.920
um is that a threat or a promise

42:23.920 --> 42:25.920
um oh I was gonna

42:25.920 --> 42:27.920
do marshmallows

42:27.920 --> 42:29.920
actually I've got such nice

42:29.920 --> 42:31.920
marshmallows you guys need to stop being so nice to me

42:31.920 --> 42:33.920
because if I get emotional

42:33.920 --> 42:35.920
and start reading them I start getting

42:35.920 --> 42:37.920
teary-eyed and I'm like I can't handle these

42:37.920 --> 42:39.920
right now because it's gonna like make me cry

42:39.920 --> 42:41.920
like happy tears

42:41.920 --> 42:43.920
um so you guys need to stop being so nice to me

42:47.920 --> 42:49.920
there's currently a riflin

42:49.920 --> 42:51.920
um

42:51.920 --> 42:53.920
who's keeping me updated about their addiction

42:53.920 --> 42:55.920
right now and they're like

42:55.920 --> 42:57.920
I don't even feel the need to go back to my addiction

42:57.920 --> 42:59.920
I'm like oh my god you're kicking your addiction

42:59.920 --> 43:01.920
I'm like how

43:01.920 --> 43:03.920
how are you what how

43:03.920 --> 43:05.920
like that's amazing like I could get into

43:05.920 --> 43:07.920
the nitty-gritty of like how insane addiction

43:07.920 --> 43:09.920
is and look

43:09.920 --> 43:11.920
your brain once it creates

43:11.920 --> 43:13.920
a neural pathway it likes it wants to keep repeating

43:13.920 --> 43:15.920
that it's nice and easy it's why nostalgia

43:15.920 --> 43:17.920
is so powerful because you don't have to like

43:17.920 --> 43:19.920
learn the new lore of something

43:19.920 --> 43:21.920
it sounds silly but

43:21.920 --> 43:23.920
um

43:23.920 --> 43:25.920
like it's very easy

43:25.920 --> 43:27.920
to fall into addiction

43:27.920 --> 43:29.920
and especially

43:29.920 --> 43:31.920
your makeup your genetic

43:31.920 --> 43:33.920
makeup can make you predispositioned

43:33.920 --> 43:35.920
for it as well it's quite it's quite fascinating

43:35.920 --> 43:37.920
because it's like it's kind of like

43:37.920 --> 43:39.920
gamba like I spoke previously

43:39.920 --> 43:41.920
I had a

43:41.920 --> 43:43.920
advertisement offer

43:43.920 --> 43:45.920
of four thousand US dollars

43:45.920 --> 43:47.920
to insert a 60 second

43:47.920 --> 43:49.920
gamba ad

43:49.920 --> 43:51.920
and I said no because

43:51.920 --> 43:53.920
it's gamba

43:53.920 --> 43:55.920
but it's very interesting

43:55.920 --> 43:57.920
how

43:57.920 --> 43:59.920
severely gamba seems to

43:59.920 --> 44:01.920
affect individuals

44:01.920 --> 44:03.920
now this is just an observation

44:03.920 --> 44:05.920
but whenever I've seen

44:05.920 --> 44:07.920
gamba ads that are like stop when the fund

44:07.920 --> 44:09.920
stops a ten thousand

44:09.920 --> 44:11.920
swordfish should get you to level 78

44:11.920 --> 44:13.920
let's go oh my god

44:13.920 --> 44:15.920
78 by the end of the stream

44:15.920 --> 44:17.920
um

44:17.920 --> 44:19.920
whenever you see a gamba ad that's like don't

44:19.920 --> 44:21.920
is like stop stop when the fund stops

44:21.920 --> 44:23.920
they always show a guy

44:23.920 --> 44:25.920
and I'm wondering

44:25.920 --> 44:27.920
um

44:27.920 --> 44:29.920
not the pre

44:29.920 --> 44:31.920
the socialization

44:31.920 --> 44:33.920
because obviously if we're being

44:33.920 --> 44:35.920
very stereotypical of society

44:35.920 --> 44:37.920
we live in a society

44:37.920 --> 44:39.920
guys are normally more interested in

44:39.920 --> 44:41.920
sports and

44:41.920 --> 44:43.920
is the environment around it that it's

44:43.920 --> 44:45.920
normal to gamble

44:45.920 --> 44:47.920
and kind of like put a cheeky

44:47.920 --> 44:49.920
a tenner here on this

44:49.920 --> 44:51.920
bet a 20

44:51.920 --> 44:53.920
quid here on this bet type thing

44:53.920 --> 44:55.920
before it snowballs out of control

44:55.920 --> 44:57.920
it's quite

44:57.920 --> 44:59.920
fascinating I actually had someone

44:59.920 --> 45:01.920
in real life I knew

45:01.920 --> 45:03.920
that

45:03.920 --> 45:05.920
they weren't a family member

45:05.920 --> 45:07.920
but they were like an acquaintance and I learned

45:07.920 --> 45:09.920
of their story

45:09.920 --> 45:11.920
and basically

45:11.920 --> 45:13.920
the guy gambled away their mortgage

45:13.920 --> 45:15.920
and

45:15.920 --> 45:17.920
it's just

45:17.920 --> 45:19.920
it's such a shame what kind of

45:19.920 --> 45:21.920
grip it has

45:21.920 --> 45:23.920
on certain people because

45:23.920 --> 45:25.920
for me right now

45:25.920 --> 45:27.920
I

45:27.920 --> 45:29.920
I'm like confident that I don't

45:29.920 --> 45:31.920
have that kind of addiction

45:31.920 --> 45:33.920
I

45:33.920 --> 45:35.920
I don't it doesn't appeal to me

45:35.920 --> 45:37.920
I would I would walk away

45:37.920 --> 45:39.920
like angry that I wasted

45:39.920 --> 45:41.920
my money type thing like my brain

45:41.920 --> 45:43.920
doesn't go oh

45:43.920 --> 45:45.920
if I gamble again I'll make back

45:45.920 --> 45:47.920
what I lost like no my brain's like

45:47.920 --> 45:49.920
what a waste of time that was I'd rather play

45:49.920 --> 45:51.920
like a video game or something else like that

45:51.920 --> 45:53.920
you know

45:53.920 --> 45:55.920
I wish I could join you but not on

45:55.920 --> 45:57.920
RuneScape wait what's wrong with RuneScape

45:57.920 --> 45:59.920
it's old school

45:59.920 --> 46:01.920
look these are all reeflings we're all just hanging

46:01.920 --> 46:03.920
out outside the we're all hanging

46:03.920 --> 46:05.920
out in Edgeville for no particular

46:05.920 --> 46:07.920
reason

46:07.920 --> 46:09.920
um

46:09.920 --> 46:11.920
yeah sorry I don't know if

46:11.920 --> 46:13.920
I need to turn down the

46:15.920 --> 46:17.920
that sound effect yeah

46:17.920 --> 46:19.920
I'll turn down the sound effect just because

46:19.920 --> 46:21.920
it's very repetitive

46:21.920 --> 46:23.920
and hopefully you can still

46:23.920 --> 46:25.920
kind of hear a bit

46:25.920 --> 46:27.920
sorry

46:27.920 --> 46:29.920
we're in Edgeville together you can do better

46:29.920 --> 46:31.920
90% of gamblers quit

46:31.920 --> 46:33.920
before they've been big now I have seen

46:33.920 --> 46:35.920
those memes I have to admit they're a wee bit funny

46:35.920 --> 46:37.920
but it is

46:37.920 --> 46:39.920
just a very curious

46:41.920 --> 46:43.920
predicament that people seem to get

46:43.920 --> 46:45.920
themselves into I mean that's kind of what

46:45.920 --> 46:47.920
kick the website kick.com

46:47.920 --> 46:49.920
if you heard about it

46:49.920 --> 46:51.920
the only

46:51.920 --> 46:53.920
reason they are able to be

46:53.920 --> 46:55.920
fueled so high is because

46:55.920 --> 46:57.920
of Gambo

46:57.920 --> 46:59.920
there's no other

46:59.920 --> 47:01.920
reason and it's perfectly

47:01.920 --> 47:03.920
fine to say that

47:05.920 --> 47:07.920
but it just kind of goes to show

47:07.920 --> 47:09.920
you how big the house always

47:09.920 --> 47:11.920
wins if they can offer this

47:11.920 --> 47:13.920
business model on the side like I

47:13.920 --> 47:15.920
remember I don't know if you guys remember

47:15.920 --> 47:17.920
when Twitch like officially announced

47:17.920 --> 47:19.920
it's like banning Gambo

47:21.920 --> 47:23.920
it's just very curious

47:23.920 --> 47:25.920
because

47:25.920 --> 47:27.920
there's a lot of

47:27.920 --> 47:29.920
discussion you can get into and you can say

47:29.920 --> 47:31.920
well the person that's Gambo

47:31.920 --> 47:33.920
and it's their money

47:33.920 --> 47:35.920
it's their life

47:35.920 --> 47:37.920
it's their choice

47:37.920 --> 47:39.920
but if like

47:39.920 --> 47:41.920
the oh I'm trying to

47:41.920 --> 47:43.920
think and do two things at once and it's not coming out in a

47:43.920 --> 47:45.920
sense so

47:47.920 --> 47:49.920
is it the

47:49.920 --> 47:51.920
right hold on hold on let me put my sense together

47:53.920 --> 47:55.920
when is it not a choice

47:55.920 --> 47:57.920
when is it not a choice is the

47:57.920 --> 47:59.920
question why is it it's

47:59.920 --> 48:01.920
addiction and not a choice when it comes

48:01.920 --> 48:03.920
to Gambo but it

48:03.920 --> 48:05.920
might be a choice when it comes to other bad

48:05.920 --> 48:07.920
actions you might do in your life

48:07.920 --> 48:09.920
why is Gambo marked out for one

48:09.920 --> 48:11.920
why is alcoholism marked out for one

48:11.920 --> 48:13.920
obviously when it comes to alcoholism

48:13.920 --> 48:15.920
your body does change the tolerance

48:15.920 --> 48:17.920
but you could argue the same for Gambo

48:17.920 --> 48:19.920
because your brain literally

48:19.920 --> 48:21.920
lights up like fireworks

48:21.920 --> 48:23.920
when you win

48:23.920 --> 48:25.920
and

48:25.920 --> 48:27.920
it's just very interesting because where's

48:27.920 --> 48:29.920
the line drawn from someone is consenting

48:29.920 --> 48:31.920
to do this activity and someone

48:31.920 --> 48:33.920
isn't able to consent to do this activity

48:33.920 --> 48:35.920
because it's causing harm because

48:35.920 --> 48:37.920
you could argue sitting on runescape

48:37.920 --> 48:39.920
for 12 hours well that's causing harm

48:39.920 --> 48:41.920
oh well

48:41.920 --> 48:43.920
we'll need to take her offline

48:43.920 --> 48:45.920
because she's not well because she's doing this

48:45.920 --> 48:47.920
for 12 hours because that's bad

48:47.920 --> 48:49.920
for her health sitting for 12 hours

48:49.920 --> 48:51.920
type thing you know

48:51.920 --> 48:53.920
like do you know what I'm trying to like say out loud

48:53.920 --> 48:55.920
I struggle to say the words

48:55.920 --> 48:57.920
RATMA thank you for coming

48:57.920 --> 48:59.920
I'll member to your destructive behaviors

48:59.920 --> 49:01.920
that have historically

49:01.920 --> 49:03.920
been deemed as vices that's where it is

49:03.920 --> 49:05.920
yeah like we're being

49:05.920 --> 49:07.920
called out literally all runescapers

49:07.920 --> 49:09.920
getting called out from across the line

49:09.920 --> 49:11.920
wow we're about to level up again

49:11.920 --> 49:13.920
oh my god just hit just let me

49:13.920 --> 49:15.920
do one ramble and we're gonna be

49:15.920 --> 49:17.920
99 overnight like just

49:17.920 --> 49:19.920
give me one subject to ramble

49:19.920 --> 49:21.920
about and we're done there is a log out

49:21.920 --> 49:23.920
timer after six hours and I will

49:23.920 --> 49:25.920
most likely log me out when I go for the big job

49:25.920 --> 49:27.920
I don't need one right now

49:27.920 --> 49:29.920
um

49:29.920 --> 49:31.920
but yeah

49:31.920 --> 49:33.920
me and college maxing on runescape

49:33.920 --> 49:35.920
citizen homework real

49:35.920 --> 49:37.920
the lanes do get but well that's

49:37.920 --> 49:39.920
it's the interesting thing it's like when

49:39.920 --> 49:41.920
where do laws come into place to

49:41.920 --> 49:43.920
protect gamba

49:43.920 --> 49:45.920
gamblers sorry

49:45.920 --> 49:47.920
um because when you lose

49:47.920 --> 49:49.920
your money you're told tough

49:49.920 --> 49:51.920
tough bananas

49:51.920 --> 49:53.920
yeah 56

49:53.920 --> 49:55.920
yatta

49:55.920 --> 49:57.920
when you lose all your money you're told

49:57.920 --> 49:59.920
tough bananas

49:59.920 --> 50:01.920
when you lose your money to a scam

50:01.920 --> 50:03.920
the bank says see tough bananas

50:03.920 --> 50:05.920
yeah there's laws in place to

50:05.920 --> 50:07.920
protect you in quotation marks and to

50:07.920 --> 50:09.920
get um the scammers

50:09.920 --> 50:11.920
put in jail to get well you can't

50:11.920 --> 50:13.920
really put um

50:13.920 --> 50:15.920
casinos in jail so that doesn't work

50:15.920 --> 50:17.920
uh that's a terrible

50:17.920 --> 50:19.920
uh comparison

50:19.920 --> 50:21.920
um

50:21.920 --> 50:23.920
hmm

50:23.920 --> 50:25.920
hmm well

50:25.920 --> 50:27.920
I've kind of shot myself in that line of

50:27.920 --> 50:29.920
line of thought I've uh completely undone

50:29.920 --> 50:31.920
my that line of thought there I do apologize

50:31.920 --> 50:33.920
um

50:33.920 --> 50:35.920
yes yes yes yes

50:35.920 --> 50:37.920
there's really no good answer no there

50:37.920 --> 50:39.920
isn't that's the thing

50:39.920 --> 50:41.920
that's the thing that's the thing I want

50:41.920 --> 50:43.920
to highlight there is

50:43.920 --> 50:45.920
no answer and

50:45.920 --> 50:47.920
yet we still have some laws

50:47.920 --> 50:49.920
such as you know obviously twitch

50:49.920 --> 50:51.920
isn't law but twitch is a reflection

50:51.920 --> 50:53.920
of the community views

50:53.920 --> 50:55.920
or the community the views of the masses

50:55.920 --> 50:57.920
now do you remember

50:57.920 --> 50:59.920
when uh

50:59.920 --> 51:01.920
wikimane was like yeah gamba bad

51:01.920 --> 51:03.920
and then all of a sudden twitter

51:03.920 --> 51:05.920
blew up and then twitter was like

51:05.920 --> 51:07.920
gamba bad and then twitch

51:07.920 --> 51:09.920
was like okay now we'll remove

51:09.920 --> 51:11.920
gamba like

51:11.920 --> 51:13.920
that is a perfect

51:13.920 --> 51:15.920
example of

51:15.920 --> 51:17.920
the most basic movement now don't

51:17.920 --> 51:19.920
get me wrong movement isn't world changing

51:19.920 --> 51:21.920
but it is the basic example

51:21.920 --> 51:23.920
of someone who definitely

51:23.920 --> 51:25.920
has a larger platform even denying it

51:25.920 --> 51:27.920
going hey this thing

51:27.920 --> 51:29.920
bad and then everyone going

51:29.920 --> 51:31.920
wait a minute yes

51:31.920 --> 51:33.920
this thing is bad

51:33.920 --> 51:35.920
and then boom

51:35.920 --> 51:37.920
twitch

51:37.920 --> 51:39.920
got rid of the category

51:39.920 --> 51:41.920
and outlawed it and said no bad

51:41.920 --> 51:43.920
now that is

51:43.920 --> 51:45.920
and just

51:45.920 --> 51:47.920
a bloody perfect example

51:47.920 --> 51:49.920
of how

51:49.920 --> 51:51.920
the community

51:51.920 --> 51:53.920
the community in

51:53.920 --> 51:55.920
specific areas and pockets

51:55.920 --> 51:57.920
do have a voice

51:57.920 --> 51:59.920
and do have a say

51:59.920 --> 52:01.920
as much as you might not think on an individual

52:01.920 --> 52:03.920
level you don't have a voice

52:03.920 --> 52:05.920
it might be true but have you ever

52:05.920 --> 52:07.920
seen planet of the apes

52:07.920 --> 52:09.920
monkey on own

52:09.920 --> 52:11.920
weak

52:11.920 --> 52:13.920
monkey together strong

52:13.920 --> 52:15.920
it is true

52:15.920 --> 52:17.920
you can't even deny it there's so many

52:17.920 --> 52:19.920
examples of this

52:19.920 --> 52:21.920
like think of revolutions

52:21.920 --> 52:23.920
such as the french revolution

52:23.920 --> 52:25.920
one individual would get their head

52:25.920 --> 52:27.920
guillotined okay

52:27.920 --> 52:29.920
I'm not being funny I'm being so

52:29.920 --> 52:31.920
true this is my rabbit hole

52:31.920 --> 52:33.920
but like literally the french

52:33.920 --> 52:35.920
revolution one person stands up

52:35.920 --> 52:37.920
and gets their head chopped off right

52:37.920 --> 52:39.920
no revolution no movement

52:39.920 --> 52:41.920
community is not you know

52:41.920 --> 52:43.920
community is not going to rise up

52:43.920 --> 52:45.920
but hold on a minute the people are revolting

52:45.920 --> 52:47.920
the people are

52:47.920 --> 52:49.920
revolting the masses are outraged

52:49.920 --> 52:51.920
how can society continue

52:51.920 --> 52:53.920
if everyone bands together

52:53.920 --> 52:55.920
and

52:55.920 --> 52:57.920
historically every 400 years

52:57.920 --> 52:59.920
society

52:59.920 --> 53:01.920
shifts and what do I mean by

53:01.920 --> 53:03.920
society shifts something new

53:03.920 --> 53:05.920
comes up for society to be

53:05.920 --> 53:07.920
a part of okay

53:07.920 --> 53:09.920
so before capitalism

53:09.920 --> 53:11.920
which is when global

53:11.920 --> 53:13.920
economics became a thing

53:13.920 --> 53:15.920
the industrial revolution

53:15.920 --> 53:17.920
global economics there was

53:17.920 --> 53:19.920
region locked capitalism

53:19.920 --> 53:21.920
okay and it's called feudalism

53:21.920 --> 53:23.920
or something like that it's like

53:23.920 --> 53:25.920
it's not feudalism it's like feudalism

53:25.920 --> 53:27.920
okay

53:27.920 --> 53:29.920
which was when

53:29.920 --> 53:31.920
lords owned

53:31.920 --> 53:33.920
the plots of land and permitted

53:33.920 --> 53:35.920
peasants to generate food

53:35.920 --> 53:37.920
on those lands okay

53:37.920 --> 53:39.920
that was region locked capitalism

53:39.920 --> 53:41.920
before we know capitalism today

53:41.920 --> 53:43.920
okay but that got outdated

53:43.920 --> 53:45.920
when the revolution came in

53:45.920 --> 53:47.920
because you know

53:47.920 --> 53:49.920
people learn fast to

53:49.920 --> 53:51.920
grow certain crops

53:51.920 --> 53:53.920
and if you breed crops I can't remember

53:53.920 --> 53:55.920
who did the crop breeding

53:55.920 --> 53:57.920
what's his name

53:57.920 --> 53:59.920
I've forgotten

53:59.920 --> 54:01.920
feudalism is with lords yes

54:01.920 --> 54:03.920
yes the chickens are revolting

54:03.920 --> 54:05.920
finally we agree on something

54:05.920 --> 54:07.920
bro it's not 400 years it's like a decade

54:07.920 --> 54:09.920
stuff changes all the time

54:09.920 --> 54:11.920
but like another massive example

54:11.920 --> 54:13.920
of a shift in society

54:13.920 --> 54:15.920
some of yous are not going to like this

54:15.920 --> 54:17.920
you're in for a rambling stream

54:17.920 --> 54:19.920
you've got me for 12 hours

54:19.920 --> 54:21.920
as if I'm not going to get on my high horse and teach you history

54:21.920 --> 54:23.920
okay

54:23.920 --> 54:25.920
if you did not know

54:25.920 --> 54:27.920
in Christianity

54:27.920 --> 54:29.920
there's the Old Testament

54:29.920 --> 54:31.920
and there's the New Testament

54:31.920 --> 54:33.920
the New Testament

54:33.920 --> 54:35.920
was created

54:35.920 --> 54:37.920
I believe

54:37.920 --> 54:39.920
in roughly the 15th century

54:39.920 --> 54:41.920
the church got together

54:41.920 --> 54:43.920
and went look the Old Testament

54:43.920 --> 54:45.920
isn't doing it for the masses

54:45.920 --> 54:47.920
people are starting to question that

54:47.920 --> 54:49.920
because people are becoming aware

54:49.920 --> 54:51.920
that you know

54:51.920 --> 54:53.920
some things aren't working out

54:53.920 --> 54:55.920
in this story

54:55.920 --> 54:57.920
and basically

54:57.920 --> 54:59.920
the New Testament is just

54:59.920 --> 55:01.920
friggin made up

55:01.920 --> 55:03.920
1500

55:03.920 --> 55:05.920
years later after

55:05.920 --> 55:07.920
Jebus the source

55:07.920 --> 55:09.920
supposedly passed away

55:09.920 --> 55:11.920
you're so right strongy let's eat the rich

55:11.920 --> 55:13.920
fondly thank you for this too

55:15.920 --> 55:17.920
like some people can't conceptualise

55:17.920 --> 55:19.920
the difference between a million and a billion

55:19.920 --> 55:21.920
dollars

55:21.920 --> 55:23.920
now take that million

55:23.920 --> 55:25.920
and add one and then add one and then add one

55:25.920 --> 55:27.920
then add one and keep going and keep going and keep going

55:27.920 --> 55:29.920
and keep going and keep going

55:29.920 --> 55:31.920
but anyway

55:31.920 --> 55:33.920
casually red fill in the masses

55:33.920 --> 55:35.920
bruv I'm not kidding I will keep mentioning

55:35.920 --> 55:37.920
the game

55:37.920 --> 55:39.920
needy streamer overload

55:39.920 --> 55:41.920
I don't believe they put that in the game

55:41.920 --> 55:43.920
that kind of thing

55:43.920 --> 55:45.920
but anyway

55:45.920 --> 55:47.920
anyway that's just me

55:47.920 --> 55:49.920
I don't know what you guys are thinking

55:49.920 --> 55:51.920
but that's just me

55:51.920 --> 55:53.920
but I could really get on my high horse

55:53.920 --> 55:55.920
I should actually I want to do an education stream

55:55.920 --> 55:57.920
about feudalism

55:57.920 --> 55:59.920
because

55:59.920 --> 56:01.920
and kind of how history and how society used to work

56:01.920 --> 56:03.920
because bargaining used to be how

56:03.920 --> 56:05.920
it was done

56:05.920 --> 56:07.920
bargaining used to be like hey

56:07.920 --> 56:09.920
two weeks

56:09.920 --> 56:11.920
would you trade me one potato for two

56:11.920 --> 56:13.920
weeks that's how it used to be done

56:13.920 --> 56:15.920
that's how there was value in things

56:15.920 --> 56:17.920
that's how humans

56:17.920 --> 56:19.920
did it and

56:19.920 --> 56:21.920
there are

56:21.920 --> 56:23.920
there are some examples today

56:23.920 --> 56:25.920
of it kind of thriving

56:25.920 --> 56:27.920
and

56:27.920 --> 56:29.920
so runescape is historically

56:29.920 --> 56:31.920
accurate yes

56:31.920 --> 56:33.920
you guys trading me right now

56:33.920 --> 56:35.920
you are calling upon your ancestors

56:35.920 --> 56:37.920
to give me the resources that you don't need

56:37.920 --> 56:39.920
in the moment

56:39.920 --> 56:41.920
you are looking after me and in return

56:41.920 --> 56:43.920
I will scratch your back later

56:43.920 --> 56:45.920
it's literally why I'm such a big believer

56:45.920 --> 56:47.920
and you scratch my back I scratch yours

56:47.920 --> 56:49.920
because that's how it used to be

56:49.920 --> 56:51.920
return to monkey

56:51.920 --> 56:53.920
replays return to monkey

56:53.920 --> 56:55.920
we were so nice

56:55.920 --> 56:57.920
we had some communities

56:57.920 --> 56:59.920
we had said it's a belonging

56:59.920 --> 57:01.920
it's so

57:01.920 --> 57:03.920
nice

57:03.920 --> 57:05.920
the old test schools

57:05.920 --> 57:07.920
I'm curious

57:07.920 --> 57:09.920
I've not touched old schools runescape

57:09.920 --> 57:11.920

57:11.920 --> 57:13.920
on the top left so I am using

57:13.920 --> 57:15.920
a plugin called runelight

57:15.920 --> 57:17.920
you can see it up here this plugin

57:17.920 --> 57:19.920
can track your things

57:19.920 --> 57:21.920
there are good bad examples of this

57:21.920 --> 57:23.920
one stick is weak

57:23.920 --> 57:25.920
many together are strong

57:25.920 --> 57:27.920
like the 1940

57:27.920 --> 57:29.920

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.920
and we're not cooking

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.920
wait a minute

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.920
wait a minute

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.920
we're not cooking

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.920
um

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.920
any membership items yet

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.920
so we don't need to go into membership world

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.920
a lot of reflings gifted me

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.920
a ton of fish

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.920
so I'm just powering through that now

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.920
um and

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.920
and another reflin

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.920
gave me 10,000 frickets sword fish

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.920
I don't know how long it's going to take to get through that

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.920
I don't know if that may actually take us

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.920
to the end of the

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.920
stream

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.920
10,000 fish

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.920
since a lot

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.920

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.920
oh sorry Mizzio

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.920

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.920
I can't do it

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.920

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.920
I don't know

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.920
I can do french

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.920
scottish just to like mess with you

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.920
type of french but

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.920
the actual french

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.920
speaking

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.920
like

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.920
I'm trying to think of a sense

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.920
to say

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.920
monchichons

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.920
machichons

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.920

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.920
yiddies

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.920

my brain can't parley the french right now

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.920
it's too hard

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.920
my roommate that showed me

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.920
your content just DM'd me that

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.920
cause of that super chat

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.920
they're like I know

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.920
what you are

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.920
oh Gimli

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.920
I can't have you in the room hey

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.920
she's just gonna

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.920
go back to sleep I was playing with her

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.920
I play

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.920
with my cats before a live stream

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.920
to tire them out

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.920
but I couldn't play with her too long

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.920
so she's currently going nuts right now

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.920
but she'll go down for a sleep cause she wasn't sleeping

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.920
when I was sleeping so she'll

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.920
don't worry don't worry about my pooders

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.920
and whenever I go make a tea in that

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.920
I go give her some attention

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.920
baby boy is really independent

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.920
though he's like not he couldn't care

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.920
I don't know if it's cause he's half

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.920
munchkin that he's

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.920
more tired than the usual cat

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.920
like you can get depending on the breed of

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.920
your cat it can be really tired

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.920
in general and need like more sleep

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.920
like I'm pretty sure there's

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.920
a type of dog that's known for sleeping

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.920
oh wait it's greyhounds

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.920
greyhounds are like the laziest

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.920
dog ever but they can do like

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.920
one burst sprint type thing

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.920
um

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.920
yeah 21 million

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.920
um literally I got sugar daddy

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.920
out the wazoo cause of reeflings

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.920
they were throwing them

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.920
coins to me I was like I'm not gonna

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.920
say no this is gonna fund the

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.920
I don't know if we're doing wine

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.920
I don't know wine is the

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.920
fastest level up

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.920
once I've like cooked everything

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920
if I push it I can

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.920
finish my first save file in November

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.920
oh I haven't even finished a save file

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.920
I was considering doing some eating runs

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.920
just to show you guys

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.920
what

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.920
the binding of Isaac is all about

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.920
um

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.920
who needs a bot farm when you have a cult

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.920
giving you everything you need

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.920
literally though

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.920
when I had a st. Bernard

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.920
it felt like it slept for 20 hours a day

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.920
yeah like depending on the breed

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.920
um but she's just

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.920
moody I fed her and I played

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.920
with her mouse

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.920
but the problem is because

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.920
I let her in yesterday

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.920
she now thinks she can come in whenever she wants

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.920
um

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.920
you're a bit of a diva

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.920
Gimli you're a bit of a diva

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.920
I have to admit

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.920
but I love her

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.920
I love her

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.920
you're always cooking

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.920
oh I ain't just cooking in Rinske

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.920
um

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.920
I can't

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.920
tomorrow's crash bandicoot

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.920
um

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.920
yes

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.920
I think

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.920
July streams

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.920
I'm gonna focus on Xbox games

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.920
to get my gamer score up

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.920
um

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.920
I've done decent progress

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.920
on my goal of collabing with 100 vtubers

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.920
with

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.920
a 3d old thing

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.920
like 3 ASMR collabs

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.920
I have absolutely no issue with actually collabing on stream

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.920
yeah good luck with that

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.920
I'm too shy

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.920
I've made great progress

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.920
I think I'm just shy of

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.920
6 ASMR collabs

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.920
um

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.920
and then I need to

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.920
reach out

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.920
and do

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.920
hmm

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.920
I want to make all of my goals

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.920
happen before the one year mark

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.920
which means I have to work hard now

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.920
um

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.920
so

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.920
um

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.920
and we've got membership coming up as well

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.920
cause we've got a lot of lost time

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920
to make up for but I hope

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.920
like you can see with my efforts

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.920
and all my hard work there like

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.920
I'm making up for lost time

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.920
you know it's going good

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.920
like I want content out the wazoo

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.920
um

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.920
I want it to be like good funny times

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.920
like literally uploaded that meme ASMR

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.920
like please let me hold it

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.920
any plans for halo yes

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.920
I would love if I could actually

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.920
do

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.920
a vtuber collab on halo

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.920
but

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.920
I don't know anyone who's played halo

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.920
I will ask the violour girls

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.920
first before I ask around

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.920
and see if anyone's played halo

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.920
um

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.920
not that you need to be

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.920
um good at halo

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.920
to play it like you need to know about it

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.920
but I'd rather

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.920
I think if you're playing a nostalgic

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.920
game I'd rather like two people who are

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.920
familiar with it play and that sounds

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.920
really rude I hope it doesn't come across as rude

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.920
but I mean

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.920
I'm sure there's another halo vtuber that's

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.920
freaking played random question

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.920

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.920
oh god the peeler

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.920
we literally can't outrun them

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.920
that gartic phone stream was so

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.920
fun though the girls are so funny

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.920
um

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.920
but yeah

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.920
the

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.920
already levelled up again

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.920
literally I am rambling through these levels

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.920
like nothing on earth

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.920
like I wake up on the other side of the ramble

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.920
and we're literally 58

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.920
that's fantastic

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.920
oh my goodness

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.920
all these lobbies

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.920
I'm burning them a wee bit but it's fine

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.920
okay you and emmy agree hard

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.920
on that ending yeah

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.920
literally I'm sorry but why on earth would you make

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.920
why would you

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.920
why would you play the game and be like

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.920
uh I'm not gonna do that ending

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.920
no the whole point is to like

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.920
be fine with human curiosity

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.920
like as long as you don't produce any offspring

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.920
no one gives a rest

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.920
no one gives a

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.920
honestly

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.920
um

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.920
hmm

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.920
halo would be a fun way to do community games

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.920
uh like the halo molly

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.920
player I never actually played much of it

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.920
I heard

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.920
the bat

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.920
was it a halo battle pass came out

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.920
and it was just an absolute shambles

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.920
like it was just a terrible

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.920
multiplayer launch

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.920
and it and then they did battle

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.920
pass and then it just became

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.920
like this terrible

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.920
thing I don't know

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.920
what ending the one

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.920
true ending

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.920
oh actually

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.920
I was lurking quite a lot someone was like

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.920
wait I don't get it are we emmy's brother

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.920
the reason why you can

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.920
see emmy at all times when she streams

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.920
is because you're her dead brother

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.920
watching over her

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.920
I will spell it out for you

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.920
you are her

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.920
dead brother watching over her

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.920
which is why you can see her stream

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.920
which is why you can see her thoughts

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.920
on twitter okay

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.920
I'll spell it out for you

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.920
the pin pals that don't get it

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.920

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.920

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.920
hmm

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.920
very important

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.920
very very important

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.920
oh actually

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.920
tomorrow's crash bandicoot

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.920
but I'm 99% sure

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.920
buckshot roulette is after

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.920
and it's like a super small game

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.920
em if it's a small game

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.920
don't worry I'm going to

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.920
whenever I do like a two hour stream

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.920
just know I'm cooking in the background

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.920
like trying to edit collabs

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.920
or get a collab together

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.920
or do something for the girls

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.920

the girls via ubu market

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.920
they get 100% of

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.920
the income generated

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.920
veiler do not take a cut

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.920
and the girls can attest to that

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.920
em we don't have

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.920
anything to do with it

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.920
and it completely and wholeheartedly supports them

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.920
if you wanted to

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.920
collect all the key chains of the girls

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.920
that could be something very sweet and cute

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.920
that's what I'm doing and I'm gonna make an ASMR

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.920
of me tapping it with my little fake

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.920
mermaid nails that I showed on my handcam stream

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.920
em

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.920
but yeah

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.920
she be love

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.920
she be all

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.920
she's basically a lean

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.920
I'm so glad

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.920
that the girls can see their hard effort

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.920
pay off right away

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.920
they've been nothing but fantastic

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.920
they really have

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.920
is the merch limited

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.920
no it's not

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.920
it's gonna stay up

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.920
until we expire

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.920
ubu market has been

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.920
absolutely fantastic to work with

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.920
em they are

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.920
super good I am aware

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.920
that they got a bit of flat

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.920
cause of some production issues

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.920
but they actually moved

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.920
em they moved

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.920
locations quite a few times

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.920
cause their business expanded so fast

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.920
that they basically had growing pains

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.920
but I have never personally

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.920
had an issue with them now I know that's

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.920
kinda being like well you never had an issue

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.920
with others that's just dismissing the others

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.920
relax I understand how it works

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.920
but em to work with

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.920
ubu market they've been

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.920
they were so understanding from the get go

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.920
cause I messaged them and I'm like

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.920
hey violers the thing

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.920
I'd love it if the girls can keep 100%

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.920
of the earnings

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.920
we as the company don't want to take a cut

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.920
and they're like yeah we can set that up

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.920
no problem and I was like here

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.920
here's all the references to the artwork

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.920
yeah we can do that no problem

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.920
and just they've handled everything

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.920
and it has been really nice

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.920
to not have to deal with anything

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.920
it makes things nice

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.920
and juicy and easy

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.920
em

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.920
one of the things, few things about

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.920
violers the lack of corporation greed

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.920
yeah I just

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.920
I I mean

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.920
Shawnee can your patterns

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.920
go in reverse

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.920
no they can't they can not

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.920
they only go in reverse if I do that

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.920
it'll like should yeah see

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.920
how it goes in reverse it's because

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.920
it has to reset to the top

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.920
of my head in order to do that

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.920
reverse thing oh we can

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.920
test that again yeah see how it

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.920
reverses to the top of my head that's

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.920
to make sure it works thank you for the 10

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.920
barrel you know you could ask that for free

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.920
you guys don't have to

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.920
ask questions via

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.920
em

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.920
money it's not necessary

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.920
it's really not

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.920
necessary you don't have to ask questions via

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.920
money you're more than welcome to ask

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.920

anonymously please don't worry

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.920
em

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.920
but yes em I am a very strong

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.920
believer in

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.920
em the girls earn the money

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:24.920
they get to keep the lines share

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.920
em

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.920
because I don't

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.920
I don't think it's very nice

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.920
if the girls were only earning

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.920
like the standard 50-50 rate

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.920
like what's your motivation to work

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.920
if every time you make 100 bucks

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.920
a management take 50

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.920

other than like handing you the model because

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.920

again

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.920

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.920
can you have a rave party with your

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.920
hair, Neil

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.920
I can't do anything else with my hair other than

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.920
Toggle

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.920
I just like hearing my name spoken with a Scottish accent

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.920
you should teach others how to speak like that

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.920
I think it could be a thing

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.920
well she'd be starting to develop a

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.920
not a pretty decent Scottish accent

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.920
em

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.920
I don't know how much she used to watch me

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.920
wink wink

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.920
em but she certainly gives

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.920
an impression she's listened to me for a decent

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:28.920
amount but when we were playing

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.920
Gartik phone and

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.920
and I was like oh when the jobby hits your

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.920
stay on the way out

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.920

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.920
a jobby I'm like oh my god

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.920
I really need to put a game together to teach these girls

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.920
just letting you know I'm

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.920
tiny cuttles in game

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.920
tiny spain e

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.920

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.920
that's how you told me to say it so I'll say it that way

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.920
I was in Mercy's chat

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.920
and the snippets were baffled by what a

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.920
jobby was

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.920
bruv literally I'm like oh my god Danny I do the

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.920
Scottish slang stream

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.920
I wouldn't mind doing a Scottish

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.920
history stream that would be quite fun

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.920
but I've got the Scottish game

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.920
show on St Andrews Day

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.920
and I'm like oh yeah

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.920
that's right I can't do the Scottish stream

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.920

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.920
achieved that before but

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.920

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.920
the lobsters we're going to be on swordfish duty

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.920

purple burglar

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.920
see I can say it if I'm not doing heavy

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.920
flying purple burglar alarm

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.920
but if I like to say it together

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.920

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.920

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.920
let's

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.920
go on our

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.920
clear

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.920
right we are officially

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.920
tackling the

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.920
10,000

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.920
raw swordfish

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.920
we'll see where we are in an hour

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.920
right let me

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.920
what's the past 22 minutes

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.920
past okay give us

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.920
an hour and see how many swordfish we are

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.920
because I don't know how fast I can

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.920
like get through these

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.920
thank you for the

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.920
super chat Jack

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.920

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.920

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.920
say yeah it gets

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.920
caught on my tongue gets caught

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.920
on the roof of my mouth to try and

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.920
annunciate burglar

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.920
burglar

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.920
the box at the top left tells you how fast

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.920
a thousand

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.920
a thousand per hour

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.920
so we will finish the swordfish

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.920
I think we might be able to finish

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.920
the swordfish if I don't get distracted

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:08.920
and don't need to like

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.920
go make too many teas

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.920
I think at the three hour mark

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.920
we'll take a toilet break

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.920
and I'll get some food

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.920
because I don't have any food in the morning

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.920
like I just I wake up and I come on

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.920

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.920

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.920
um

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.920
with a steady pace you can do

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.920
one an hour one K an hour

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.920
that's that's pretty good

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.920
that's really good

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.920
um

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.920
right let's whittle this down to nothing then

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.920
by the end of the stream we'll finish

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.920

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.920

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.920

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.920
59

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.920

I didn't hear Brian talk

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.920
I wonder if Brian doesn't talk during super chats

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.920
Brian

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.920

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.920
but

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.920
you only wear killets during special events

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.920
like weddings are probably the biggest

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.920

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.920

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.920

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.920
we're already at the

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.920
10.3 we started at

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.920
10.5

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.920

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.920
strongy shows up in Elden Ring like a blue

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.920
power ranger am Scottish

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.920
like that dress from

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.920
DS1

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.920
it's for the ventilation

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.920
literally you cannot get swamp ass

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.920
via a kill congrats

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.920
um

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:42.920
but your

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.920
fatty bojangles will be bojangling

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.920
I think

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.920
I don't know how elastic

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.920
yeah okay gimme is yelling out my door

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.920
I can hear her go nuts

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.920
she might start hammering on the door

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.920
because she opens them by going up on her back legs

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:58.920
and like pushing with her front paws

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.920
so if you start hearing like

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.920
that's her currently

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.920
like opening the

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.920
well attempting to open the door

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.920
um

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.920
you need to listen to this song

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.920
donal where are your truzers it's a joke song about kills

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.920
I'd play it but I'd probably get copyright

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.920
ridiculous

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.920
oh my burn rate is

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.920
9%

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.920
well hopefully that can get lowered because

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.920
missing out on 10% xp

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.920
on full inventories is rough

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.920
is rough

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.920
but we're getting there

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.920
sorry how do I use it on the

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.920

that it is an interest

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.920
in certain individuals

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.920
so whoever

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.920

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.920
I'm glad you are

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.920

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.920
well no sorry

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.920

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.920
someone wanted to pay me

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.920
$200 to stream

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.920

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.920
bottles of water every hour

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.920
but I don't go to the toilet

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:44.920
it was their thing

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.920
they wanted me to be like

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.920

I did not carry out with such a request

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.920
however

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.920
it was rather interesting learning about that

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.920
because that was the first time I had ever been exposed to it

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.920

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.920

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.920
me being dehydrated

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.920

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.920
just doing 99 cooking

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.920
we are currently

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.920
59

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.920
emm and

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.920
sorry it must have been a refling mention in the money they gave

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:34.920
me in chat I'm sure I read someone saying

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.920
I gave you that and then what

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:38.920
emm we are

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.920
59 cooking we have a stack of

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.920
10,000 swordfish which was

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:44.920
which was not cheap at all

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.920
not cheap at all

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.920
we are currently cooking through that and I am

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.920
ranting and raving

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.920
my head off

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.920
emm just about anything and everything

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.920
emm

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.920
but yes I was currently gushing about

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.920
the girls doing hand cam streams

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.920
now that sheby's monetised

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.920
I actually don't know when she's doing her monetisation stream

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.920
emm

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.920
hold on let me just

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.920
let me just ask her when

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.920
are you doing

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:14.920
monetisation stream because I might need to put her monetisation

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.920
live

01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:18.920
emm eeps

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.920
eeps because I've not put her monetisation live

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.920
emm and before you're like wait

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.920
you control monetisation

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.920
no in order for the girls to be less

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.920
stressed I do the

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.920
kind of boring stuff which is opening up

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.920
memberships and setting it

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.920
the price and adding her emotes to her

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.920
badges for example

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.920
emm hey fart head

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.920
hey shit

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.920
emm yes

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.920
so if sheby plans on

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.920
doing it the day

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.920
I will have to quickly run away for 5 minutes

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.920
and quickly set that up because I don't have

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.920
access to her account

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.920
on the cp your cash is

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.920
20 times the cost of that swordfish though

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.920
I know but I didn't do anything for the cash

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.920
or the swordfish

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.920
I just came I just got here

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.920
emm

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.920
wow level 60

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.920
wow

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:10.920
that's amazing

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.920
frickin 60 how many

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:14.920
are we burnt or burned

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.920
percentage is going up

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.920
cause I know swordfish is a bit harder than what was

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.920
cooked

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:22.920
we are still doing 1000 an hour

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.920
it is possible

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.920
I will beat the swordfish

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:28.920
stack before

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.920
emm

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.920
eh

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.920
just saying the chat that gave you the

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.920
JP is 20 times killer than me

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.920
emm yeah basic management

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.920
tell me said

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.920
emmy said she is doing it tomorrow

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.920
yes emmy and I say I am putting their stuff

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.920
live probably after

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.920
the stream

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:52.920
because I need it to go up 24 hours

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.920
cause so youtube says they need to

01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.920
approve the membership tiers

01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.920
but they don't approve nothing

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.920
they literally

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.920
can go for it

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.920
level 99 by the end of the stream trust

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.920
just doing endurance stream right after closing the

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.920
endurance stream honestly

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:10.920
eh

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.920
I could never do this I'm just giving it a

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:14.920
shot it's always been a childhood dream

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.920
of kinda like reaching 99

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.920
in any level as you can

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.920
see we haven't even touched any of the

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.920
member skills but

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.920
or my combat is so low

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.920
but

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.920
literally having it up here is really nice

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.920
emm and I picked

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.920
cooking because

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.920
I have incredibly

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.920
baby memories

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.920
of me being outside the back of

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:40.920
Lumberge castle

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:42.920
and I had my

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.920
pickaxe I had my tinder box

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:46.920
I had my little basic

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.920
bronze sword

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.920
and I used to

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.920
kill the big rats outside the

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.920
back of the castle cook them

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.920
and I think the highest cooking

01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.920
level I ever got was 40 as a child

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:00.920
emm

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.920
which is just freaking adorable

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.920
which is why I want

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.920
cooking 99 first cause I've just

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.920
enjoyed it literally these gender

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.920
norms have hands of course the wham

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:12.920
and picks cooking oh we're about to get

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.920
to 9000 the stack

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.920
is getting weir it's getting

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:18.920
smaller getting a wee wee

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.920
stack burnt swordfish

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.920
is probably worth more than cooked

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.920
on the open market these burnt food

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.920
collectors are pretty oh I'm aware

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.920
about the burnt food collectors

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.920
emm and they just give you

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.920
a price for it which is pretty crazy

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.920
emm

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.920
fire making is probably the next

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.920
fast this is winter tot

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.920
yes that was a ghost

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.920
fires in winter tot or am I making

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.920
that up

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.920
I might be making that up I'm gonna be

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.920
going crazy

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.920
emm

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.920
my current level is 60

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.920
on the dot

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.920
I did title the stream 70 question

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.920
mark but someone did

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:00.920
napkin math and said if I finish

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.920
cooking all these swordfish

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.920
I might be 78

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:06.920
which is just fantastic

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:08.920
truly

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:10.920
emm

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.920
but I thought the cooking thing was a

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.920
meta meme like mommy knows how to cook

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.920
there is the proof I mean honestly we could

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.920
do it that way as well but I kind of did it

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.920
is like oh these gender norms have hands

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:22.920
I just really enjoy cooking like I know

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.920
there's this in real life

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.920
runescape chick and she has

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:28.920
massive knockers I'm talking

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.920
a zero level knockers and I used

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.920
to just sit and watch her cook

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.920
lobsters and like so many

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.920
people would come in the chat and say such

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.920
horrendous things when would be the best

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.920
food for winter tot so we

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.920
keep all gimli

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.920
give it a rest darling I can't

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.920
have you in the room

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.920
she's up she's losing it

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.920
she's losing it

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.920
I don't know if it's coming up in the microphone

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.920
or not but she's losing it

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.920
this is I shouldn't have let her in

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.920
because now it's going to take a couple of days

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.920
for her to unlearn that she's allowed in

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.920
this room gimli

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.920
I can't hear her okay she's currently behind

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.920
the door going

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.920
basically

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.920
um

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.920
she should have given up by now

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:16.920
it's been

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.920
it's been quite a while she should have gone

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.920
to sleep I wouldn't be honest

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.920
I should have

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.920
played with her more but I ran out of time

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:26.920
because I was making a cup of tea but I did feed her

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.920
and I threw the mouse

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.920
a few times to give her a few laps around to

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.920
her dog she's not a dog

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.920
she's a cat

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.920
hmm heaven

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.920

in her

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.920
cat girl is someone from Gimli

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:38.920
I was actually gonna do

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.920
an in real life video

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.920
where I put um

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.920
a licky lick on the 3D

01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.920
ears and then both my cats will lick it

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.920
but I don't know if

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.920
YouTube will be weird about it because

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.920
I don't know what's going on

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.920
what you're looking in YouTube right now

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.920
it's absolutely terrifying

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.920
um

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.920
I don't

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.920
keep messing that up sorry oh my god

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.920
I'm not I'm not time maxing

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.920
okay she's now knocking on the door

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.920
Gimli

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:10.920
don't do that

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.920
ah mum he's no impressed Gimli

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.920
didn't he do that I shouldn't have let her in yesterday

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.920
it's opened a can of worms

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.920
oh

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.920
oh

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.920
um but yeah

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.920
can we see them the next hand cam

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.920
you saw Gimli's back

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.920
in the foot

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.920
in the celebration stream near the end of it

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.920
you saw Gimli come in the room

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.920
but I had to take her out because she was gonna knock over the webcam

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.920
um

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:40.920
I do have a picture of them

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.920
um they killed a rat

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.920
um

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.920
so I thought Gimli was the hunter

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.920
but no

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.920
Vigo was the hunter

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.920
he caught a rat in the garden

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.920
I don't even know

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.920
it was there and he

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.920
destroyed it so quickly

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.920
um

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.920
I'm pretty sure he like

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.920
so if he didn't know the way that cats hunt

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.920
is they apply pressure

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.920
on the throat of the

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.920
prey

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.920
so basically it gets

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.920
either suffocated or you know

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.920
damaged out which is a shame to say

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.920
Vigo

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.920
I let him out in the garden

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.920
and within 10 seconds

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.920
he had perished

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.920
the rat

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:28.920
I didn't, I have a picture of it

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.920
I'll maybe post it but I know people don't

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.920
like seeing dead animals so maybe it's not too nice

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:34.920
maybe I'll put like

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:36.920
a little black bar over the rat's eyes

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:38.920
just to protect its identity

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.920
you know

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:42.920
and eat and respect its wee family

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.920
um

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.920
damn though, put it in my base

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.920
cat almost knocks you

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.920
honestly

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.920
um

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.920
wait, cat almost knocks me

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.920
are you that fucking fanny

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:58.920
honestly, if you are, go and just leave me alone

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:00.920
um

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.920
but yeah we

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.920
uh

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:06.920
wee family, wee Vigo

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.920
mmm

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:10.920
is there somewhere we can

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.920
send cat pics? I mean you can just

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.920
at me

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:16.920
it's fine on twitter

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.920
uh

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.920
honestly

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.920
honestly honestly

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.920
my cat is being a menace

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.920
to the local bird population

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.920
it's illegal to let your

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.920
cats outside in Australia

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.920
or I don't know if it's just

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.920
in Victoria

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.920
but it's illegal to let them out

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:40.920
so I have a

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:42.920
caged off

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.920
which is such a shame

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.920
but I'd rather they get outside time

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.920
than no outside time at all because I actually don't think

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.920
it's natural for cats to be inside

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.920
um

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:54.920
but yeah, they made it illegal

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.920
um

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.920
Australia does have a wild cat problem

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.920
oh my god, it's so sad

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:04.920
I wish I didn't learn about it

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.920
but they basically call wild cats

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.920
instead of just doing capture and release

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.920
because it's like so out of control

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.920
type thing

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.920
and I'm like

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.920
although it's kind of like learning about cat island

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.920
in Japan, there's

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.920
a tourist state island called cat island

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.920
but the problem is

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.920
none of the cats are fled or looked after

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.920
or new urge so the population is completely

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.920
out of control

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:32.920
oh my god, Gimli

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.920
she's doing my head and

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.920
oh my god

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.920
Gimli

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.920
I know

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:44.920
you guys might not be able to hear her

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.920
she's going absolutely berserk right now

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.920
she should have given up like a long time ago

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.920
and gone back to sleep

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:52.920
what have I done? I've created a monster

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.920
because nobody wants to see Marshal no more

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:56.920
he's chop level

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:58.920
I don't know the rest of the words

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.920
oh my god

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.920
I can't think when she's me on

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.920
wait hold on

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.920
right

01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:14.920
I don't need to do her monetization

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.920
of the

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.920
video

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:22.920
okay I don't need to worry

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.920
about sheepsters but

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.920
I will be putting M.A. and A.C.'s

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.920
thing live

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:30.920
praying that a speller member names right

01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:32.920
but I'm pretty sure it's

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.920
Snow Bear

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.920
Ease

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:38.920
and

01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:40.920
Pin Pals

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:42.920
and

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:48.920
to be further driving the berserk thing

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.920
I just think it's very

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:52.920
dramatic

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.920
you've been telling me I've been breaking the law

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.920
for the past 23 years and didn't know

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:58.920
apparently it's going to slow

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:00.920
and England just made it

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:02.920
that your cat has to get microchipped

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.920
now

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:06.920
and I'm like interesting

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:08.920
but what's the real reason behind

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.920
that because is it just

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.920
another tax on pet owners

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.920
oh if you're a pet

01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.920
owner and you need to use litter

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.920
by the way like a litter box

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:20.920
you know how it's really expensive for litter box

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.920
like pellets

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.920
and all that

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.920
play sand

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:28.920
cats love to take big massive dookies in play sand

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:30.920
which is the cheapest thing ever

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.920
it lasts so long

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.920
especially if you can have an outside litter

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:36.920
tray for them if they have access to outside

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.920
you will save

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.920
literally hundreds upon thousands

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.920
of dollars over the years

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.920
it costs

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.920
eight dollars for a bag of sand

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.920
and it costs 20

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:50.920
for a decent cat grit

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:52.920
just give them sand they love it

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.920
you can scoop it it's super good

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:56.920
and it saves your pockets

01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:58.920
so much money

01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.920
because there's such a tax

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.920
on pet owners

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.920
the only thing I haven't figured out yet

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.920
is how to get good quality food

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:08.920
because

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:10.920
I was actually thinking of making like

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.920
homemade cat

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.920
the fire is gone

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.920
no

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.920
rifling what happened

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.920
wait let me pick up the ashes hold on

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.920
oh wait I can't I've got too much swordfish

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.920
wait hold on hold on

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.920
I'll pick up the ashes and take them out of the way

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.920
I need to put them out of the way okay

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.920
now the ashes are out of the way

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.920
no the embers have went out

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:34.920
I've just picked up burnt fish as well by accident

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:38.920
slim cuttles

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.920
or strongy shady

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.920
excellent cuttle stones bearer

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:44.920
em always

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.920
thought it would be cute to have a big chalky cat

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.920
oh well thanks for the tip

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.920
I can't even remember what the tip was

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:52.920
thank you for putting the fire back on again replaying

01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:56.920
it's over

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.920
they didn't kindle the fire now it's the age of darkness

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.920
crazy concept

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:02.920
go fish

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.920
the riflings with happily taste test

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.920
your homemade cat food

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:08.920
yeah I've wanted to make homemade

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:10.920
thank you for getting me back on the subject

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.920
cause I completely forgot what I was rambling about

01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:14.920
em

01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:16.920
I wanted to make homemade cat food

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.920
because they were struggling

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:20.920
to eat like that pre-made stuff

01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.920
and the thing

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.920
this sounds really bad

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.920
but on the

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.920
boxes of cat food it says not fit

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.920
for human consumption

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.920
okay

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:34.920
now the reason why that alarms me

01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:36.920
is because I would never want to give my cat

01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:38.920
something that I couldn't eat

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.920
and cats eat meat cats are

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:42.920
wow

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.920
61

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.920
thank you

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.920
thank you riflings for funding my cooking habit

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.920
em

01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.920
eh yeah

01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.920
I just find it a bit

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.920
hmm and sus

01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:58.920
that

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:00.920
it's not fit for human consumption

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:02.920
when the content is just

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:04.920
supposed to be meat that's possible

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:06.920
for cats to eat

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.920
which I don't like

01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.920
VV buys a rotisserie chicken

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:12.920
my cats didn't like

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:14.920
Willy's chicken I fed them it

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.920
actually you know

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.920
who liked Willy's chicken more than

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.920
my freaking cats

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:22.920
the magpies which I've yet to name

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.920
em it's

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.920
a husband magpie

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.920
a wife magpie

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:30.920
and a daughter magpie

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.920
that visits me

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.920
oh no

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.920
rifling

01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:38.920
oh no it's the rifling afk

01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:40.920
that normally does like the big log pile

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.920
wait I'll clear away the ashes hold on

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.920
there you go it's out of the way

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:46.920
wah

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:48.920
I keep clicking collect

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.920
bank banker take that out

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.920
then take it out raw

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.920
ooh we're at 9.8

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.920
fire fire fire

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.920
we're so on fire

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:00.920
praise the fire

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:02.920
praise the sun

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.920
em

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.920
pet food in general is a rarity

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920
let alone

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.920
affordability hmm

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.920
it's like ridiculous pricing as well

01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:14.920
like I'm not happy with the price as well

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.920
em but I thought it would be really cute

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.920
to make like

01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:20.920
homemade cat food for them

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.920
it wouldn't be the best but like I've seen

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:24.920
this youtube channel

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:26.920
I think it's called Joon's Kitchen

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.920
and it's literally dedicated to feeding

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.920
the cat's gourmet

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:32.920
homemade food and it's the most adorable

01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:34.920
thing ever and I'm like that's what I want to do

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.920
for Viko and Gimli

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.920
em cats are hyper carnivores

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.920
yes carnivores I almost said

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.920
omnivores but omnivores is both

01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:44.920

herbivores that's right

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.920

dinosaurs is

01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.920
source browse feature

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:12.920
other youtube features

01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:14.920
channel page suggested videos

01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.920
and external what's browse feature

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:18.920
is browse feature like

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:20.920
in the feed in general

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:24.920

I know you can't see the stats that I'm looking at

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:30.920
is browse feature just like

01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:32.920
in the side window

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:36.920
probably hit the algorithm

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.920
oh good

01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:40.920

screenshot this so you guys can see what I see

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.920
you can see

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:52.920
I'm not a

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.920
I'm not a secret kind of creator

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:56.920
I'll show you what I see this is what I see

01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:58.920
on the video it hasn't updated

01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:00.920
the

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.920
where is it

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:04.920
it hasn't

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.920
ah that would be too easy

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.920
wouldn't that image

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.920
make source

01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:14.920
this is just youtube

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:16.920
stats video I guess

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:18.920
ok

01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:20.920
and then pick this one on my desktop please

01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:26.920
is that it this video

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:28.920
wow

01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.920
wow on air

01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.920
you see that

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:38.920
holy

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:40.920
on air

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:42.920
that got pushed so much

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:44.920
look at browse feature

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.920
76%

01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:48.920
browse feature my goodness

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.920
but look

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:52.920
it says I got 300 subscribers for it

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.920
the money hasn't updated because

01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.920
it takes like 48 hours for the money to show

01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:58.920
wow I didn't

01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:00.920
not expect that

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:02.920
the fact the watch time

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:04.920
is 1.8k hours

01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:06.920
if you didn't know to get monetized you need

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:08.920
3k watch hours

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:10.920
holy crap

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:12.920
maybe gen 2

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:14.920
should come out with an ASMR video before

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.920
debut but kind of ruins the voice

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.920
although saying that you hear the voice in the trailer

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:20.920
in the shorts anyways that's not much of a deal

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:22.920
because it might help with the culling if the girls

01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:24.920
came out with an ASMR video for gen 2

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.920
um

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:28.920
nice when quality is rewarded

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:30.920
but look at that

01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.920
browse feature source

01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.920
that's pretty nice

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:36.920
sorry my tongue is rumbling

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.920
if you heard that

01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.920
um literally

01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:42.920
I've not even got my first thank you for

01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:44.920
1k out yet

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.920
oh

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:48.920
oh my god yeah

01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.920
wow I'm 5800

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.920
I literally tweeted

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:54.920
thanks for 5k yesterday holy crap

01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:56.920
that's insane

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.920
your trailer

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:00.920
hooked me pretty hard

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.920
well I wasn't lying

01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:10.920
during debut and I was like you'll be eating good

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.920
if you're an ASMR enthusiast

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:16.920
it's unlikely I'll get that first

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.920
video out today

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:20.920
because I'm doing

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:22.920
AC and Emmys membership when I get

01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:24.920
offline and then probably collapsing

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:26.920
unless

01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:28.920
although I will say it's really fun editing

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:30.920
my thank you

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:32.920
videos because

01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:34.920
I'm not making it

01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:36.920
super professional and like editing out

01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:38.920
all the bumps I'm just lowering the bumps

01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:40.920
in that so it's still like on the same level

01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.920
the culling was so

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.920
silly it was

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:46.920
absolutely insane on AC

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.920
I mentioned this yesterday

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.920
so don't worry if you didn't hear it

01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:52.920
but AC got called

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:54.920
1500 subscribers

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:56.920
and on the same day

01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:58.920
I got called 700 subscribers

01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.920
even though she had more

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:02.920
shorts out like I was pushing shorts

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:04.920
on AC

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:06.920
at the time

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:08.920
that's just crazy

01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:10.920
do you love a cheeky bit of ASMR

01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:14.920
it was so rough

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:16.920
on AC but she's been doing fantastic

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:18.920
honestly

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.920
I am

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.920
still interested

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.920
in a clipper program for the girls

01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:30.920
I'm just waiting for the first month

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:32.920
of income to come in and then I can

01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.920
kind of open up pie charts and be like

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.920
right is this going to be

01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:38.920
possible for Vehler to do

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:40.920
a clipping program like Idol N has done

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.920
because I really like it I think it's a really

01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.920
good way to get clippers involved

01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:46.920
and help promote the girls

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:48.920
and all that jazz

01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:50.920
I think it's fantastic so

01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:52.920
we are still looking into that

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:54.920
and hopefully it will give the girls a cheeky boost

01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.920
I've had to resub three times

01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.920
I had to

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:04.920
subscribe back onto the girls at one point as well

01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:06.920
I was like bruh we were

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:08.920
literally all each other's first subscribers

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:10.920
and I got booted off and I'm like great

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:12.920
you've stolen it from me

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.920
absolutely stolen it

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.920
I hope those missing

01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:20.920
1500 OG suns

01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:22.920
find their way to her

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.920
honestly though

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:26.920
I'm sure they will I'm sure they'll be like hey

01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.920
wasn't there a cute polar bear around here at one point

01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:30.920
if

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.920
you interact with the content

01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:34.920
like leave a like on stream or leave a comment

01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.920
then the algorithm

01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:38.920
will show the girl more to you

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:40.920
so if you are

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.920
an OG sun you're like

01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:44.920
her streams are never showing up please do consider

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:46.920
like just going on her

01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:48.920
short feed for example

01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.920
wait don't like this stuff

01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:52.920
right away like genuinely sit and watch it

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:54.920
because if you don't sit and watch it

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.920
then the algorithm knows that you

01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:58.920
are just sitting there

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:00.920
it's really annoying but the algorithm

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:02.920
is now too advanced

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.920
because

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:06.920
before way back and much older

01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.920
YouTube days if you left the like

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.920
you left the like

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:12.920
but now the algorithm is like

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:14.920
this person left the like at the 2 minute mark

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.920
maybe something interesting

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:18.920
happened 2 minutes in

01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:20.920
okay because of that statistic we're gonna now

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.920
promote this video

01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:24.920
to people who

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:26.920
have interacted with this

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.920
VTuber because they're related or something

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:30.920
like the algorithm just gets so

01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:32.920
silly

01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:34.920
I'm dying for the Hypno Viz

01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.920
the Hypno Viz can actually

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:38.920
go on YouTube. YouTube allows Hypnosis

01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:40.920
Patreon doesn't

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:42.920
make it make sense

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.920
but we love YouTube out here for that reason

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.920
it's very strange

01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.920
very very strange

01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.920
probably the first hit

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:54.920
sorry here take this burnt

01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.920
burnt swordfish

01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.920
the first ASMR

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:00.920
I'm gonna do is forget your name

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:02.920
and replace it with Reefling

02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:04.920
um

02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:06.920
I will not

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:08.920
make it a permanent effect

02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.920
I will make it

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.920
a session I think maybe a 30 minute

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.920
session if you will

02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:16.920
um

02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:18.920
and I'll give maybe give it

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.920
like 2 hour effect I really

02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:22.920
do not want to do mess around with permanent

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:24.920
effects too much it kind of scares me

02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:26.920
permanent effect stuff I have to be honest

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:28.920
I'm a bit of a scaredy cat

02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:30.920
ooh our burn percentage is up to

02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:32.920
15

02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:34.920
I think it's holding steady at 15 though

02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:36.920
and hopefully

02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.920
lower as we get more

02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.920
leveled up

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.920
um wait no Hypnosis

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.920
no Hypnosis is

02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:46.920
ban it is a

02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:48.920
bannable um

02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:50.920
offense suspendable

02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:52.920
if you will um

02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:54.920
there was a ASMR

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:56.920
artist actually that got their entire

02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:58.920
Patreon taken down not even

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:00.920
a chance to

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.920
um appeal

02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:04.920
or uh get suspended

02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:06.920
and then delete the content sometimes

02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:08.920
Patreon will suspend your account

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.920
until you

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:12.920
your content applies to their

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:14.920
TOS so if it's not too offensive

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:16.920
whatever you've done or made

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:18.920
um but there wasn't ASMR

02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:20.920
recently who got their entire thing just

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.920
taken down which was pretty

02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:24.920
crazy just making me

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:26.920
permanently less procrastinate

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:28.920
yeah honestly only

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:30.920
a bit of mind break I feel

02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:32.920
you yeah

02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.920
chubby uh weight gain

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:36.920
that got taken away

02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:38.920
um which was

02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:40.920
crazy absolutely crazy

02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.920
I'm not sure

02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:44.920
I mean I

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:46.920
I can

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:48.920
see why

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:50.920
because sometimes the stuff is like tie down

02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:52.920
to a chair and funnel fed or whatever but

02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:54.920
it just gets

02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:56.920
ridiculous because whoever's participating

02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:58.920
or creating especially for when it comes

02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:00.920
to audio side of stuff like no visuals

02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:02.920
no nothing like

02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:04.920
it gets pretty ridiculous like

02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:06.920
that you can't do it like

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:08.920
but anyway uh all healer

02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.920
mastercard overlords

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:12.920
yes yes yes yes yes you win

02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:14.920
yeah again you win you win again

02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:16.920
hey ho you win again

02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:18.920
um

02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:22.920
who's thinking up all these rules and

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.920
restrictions are overlords

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:26.920
don't you not know about them

02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:28.920
see there's this company called black rock

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:30.920
and then there's a second company called

02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:32.920
I've forgotten the name of the second company

02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.920
and they own everything um

02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:36.920
and uh

02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:38.920
oh wait until you learn about politics

02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:40.920
oh my goodness can't wait to get started

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.920
about the political

02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:44.920
side of thing and no I'm not getting into politics

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:46.920
but I'll get into destroying the

02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:48.920
economy and we should restart

02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:50.920
society or run away to

02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:52.920
a farm together I'm more

02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:54.920
opting for the farm side of things

02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:56.920
um

02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:58.920
because yeah I think the farm

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:00.920
would be a heck of a lot better option

02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:02.920
um

02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:06.920
CNC is not okay

02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.920
with Patreon which happens yes

02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:10.920
we are 62

02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:14.920
thank you 62 it's

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.920
nice to see you 62

02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.920
um

02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:20.920
but yes um

02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:22.920
so people from an outside

02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:24.920
perspective think

02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:26.920
hypnosis um

02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:28.920
you don't do anything you

02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:30.920
don't want to do when it comes to hypnosis

02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:32.920
I am a full believer in that

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:34.920
I absolutely do not think

02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:36.920
but because of the way it seemed

02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:38.920
comedically in the public eye like

02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:40.920
for example when a magician

02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:42.920
does hypnosis oh look

02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.920
they made this person drink a bottle

02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:46.920
of vinegar type thing

02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:48.920
um because it's seen that way

02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:50.920
publicly when the reality is

02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:52.920
when you participate in

02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:54.920
an alternative context

02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:56.920
you do not do anything you don't want to do

02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:58.920
this is a fact it's just

02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:00.920
how it works you

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:02.920
like people seem to think

02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:04.920
like you completely just like oh

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.920
you're inhibitions you can't control

02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:08.920
anything you're so and it's like no

02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:10.920
mother that's not

02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:12.920
how it is

02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:14.920
all reeflings

02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:16.920
all together and put a money in

02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:18.920
oh should we buy a castle

02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:20.920
should we

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:22.920
where should we what country

02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:24.920
though I want to see a castle

02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:26.920
in Scotland but um it's very hard

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:28.920
to although saying that if we

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:30.920
had a green a glass house

02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:32.920
a greenhouse then we

02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:34.920
could have tons of um

02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:36.920
produce maybe

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:38.920
we should get a castle in Scotland

02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:40.920
and then we can have

02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:42.920
a big garden and we have like we feast

02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:44.920
on the meals every night and we

02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:46.920
can try and make me for the first

02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:48.920
time

02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:50.920

learn to make meat but I feel like

02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:14.920
I'd poison everyone if I did it

02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:24.920

02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:52.920
honey tea although I

02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:54.920
should actually write an audio like

02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:56.920
that holy crap why have I not done

02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:58.920
that yet I'll do it this month

02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:00.920
because there's a myth in there oh I just

02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:02.920
really started really hard I said myth

02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:04.920
if you hate that oh my god

02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:06.920
there's a missing audio this month I'll

02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:08.920
make that plot the audio this month

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:10.920
please can I make that the plot for

02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:12.920
Patreon this month where I need

02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:14.920
my special honey tea

02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:16.920
oh my god yes

02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:18.920
um in

02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:20.920
February I know February

02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:22.920
so far away but I actually have a meta

02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:24.920
audio roleplay month

02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:26.920
as well but yeah I'll

02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:28.920
make it my missing thing

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.920
uh

02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.920
I do want to care for

02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:34.920
a little garden yes

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:36.920
so um there's a lot of hardy

02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:38.920
plants so hardy plants are

02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:40.920
considered plants that can tolerate

02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:42.920
close to frost or very

02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:44.920
low temperatures

02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:46.920
um these hardy plants

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:48.920
are things such as potatoes

02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:50.920
leaks these root vegetable

02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:52.920
type things um

02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:54.920
what's another root vegetable turnip

02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:56.920
very big um neeps and

02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:58.920
varieties um

02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:00.920
is turnips and potatoes

02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:02.920
these are very successful

02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:04.920
hardy plants in Scotland

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:06.920
so these are probably what we'll focus on

02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:08.920
and make up the main majority

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:10.920
um berries, strawberries

02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:12.920
um and

02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:14.920
blackberries for example

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:16.920
these berries are actually quite

02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:18.920
successful in Scotland

02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:20.920
against all odds

02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:22.920
um because

02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:24.920
they're quite resistant um

02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:26.920
is really quite fascinating

02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:28.920
um there's a lot of strawberry

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:30.920
production and manufacturers in

02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:32.920
Scotland if you didn't know that

02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:34.920
a little fun factoid

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:36.920
um

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:38.920
potatoes, boil and mash them

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:40.920
stick them in a stew and we make

02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:42.920
a big dinner and we have nice

02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:44.920
yummy dinners every night

02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:46.920
um a carrots

02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:48.920
yes carrots a fantastic example

02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:50.920
a ground vegetable yes yes yes

02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:52.920
um

02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:54.920
wow

02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:56.920
9.4

02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:58.920
we're about to hit 9.3

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:00.920
we're about to hit 8 we're getting so close

02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:02.920
we're getting so close

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.920
uh gollum would be fuming right now

02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:06.920
so the leaks are a winter crop yes

02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:08.920
um

02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:10.920
and we can also have like garlic

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:12.920
and I can teach you about the drying

02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:14.920
process of garlic as well

02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:16.920
um but we would need a shed for that

02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:18.920
surely one of us

02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:20.920
we flings are like DIY

02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:22.920
and can make a shed although

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:24.920
oh my god we're like getting two steps away

02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:26.920
from being Amish at this rate

02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:28.920
I've not even been funny because

02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:30.920
like the Amish are known for like building

02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:32.920
stuff really fast um

02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:34.920
but like I'm sure

02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:36.920
if all of us rooflings came together

02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:38.920
on the castle farm we could build

02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:40.920
a shed and then I can teach you all

02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:42.920
about garlic uh

02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:44.920
curing you need to dry out the

02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:46.920
garlic because if it's wet it

02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:48.920
will rot but if you dry it out

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:50.920
successfully the garlic will last

02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:52.920
an entire year from

02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:54.920
harvest season to the next

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:56.920
it will last an entire year it's absolutely

02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:58.920
fantastic and we need to get massive

02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:00.920
freezers to freeze all our produce

02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:02.920
so we can do massive meal preparation

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:04.920
as well how big of a shed are we talking

02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:06.920
it would need to be decent

02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:08.920
um

02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:10.920
I'm too scared to learn about canning

02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:12.920
food because I've heard about

02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:14.920
it literally perishes people if you mess up

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:16.920
the canning process however

02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:18.920
there's one process I really

02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:20.920
like and it's

02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:22.920
dehydrating

02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:24.920
food so you're left

02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:26.920
with the dry

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.920
husk of the food basically

02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:30.920
but I trust that and

02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:32.920
apparently that stuff lasts

02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:34.920
20 freaking years if you

02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:36.920
put it away right

02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:38.920
dehydrating food lasts 20 years and I'm like

02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:40.920
oh my god

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:42.920
um

02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:44.920
I'm like absolutely right this is

02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:46.920
just me being a weirdo I absolutely

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:48.920
love the idea of like a zombie

02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:50.920
apocalypse now don't get me wrong

02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:52.920
I will perish within the first few days

02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:54.920
I will be bitten I'm sorry I'll just

02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:56.920
admit it there's no way I'm not that good

02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:58.920
I'm not that guy trust me I'm not

02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:00.920
that guy um

02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:02.920
but I really like the idea of like

02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:04.920
having food reserves and like

02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:06.920
um I think they're called

02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:08.920
a bug out bag yes

02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.920
a bug out bag

02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:12.920
um I

02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:14.920
freaking love the idea of a bug out bag

02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:16.920
and like all this like food that's like

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:18.920
good to go is it MRE kits

02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:20.920
I wouldn't mind trying an

02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:22.920
MRE kit taste testing stream

02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:24.920
that would be funny like a hand cam

02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:26.920
MRE thing um

02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:28.920
that would be curious

02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:30.920
and then we can judge it from different places

02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:32.920
because apparently South Korea

02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:34.920
has the yummiest MRE kits

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:36.920
uh America has neutral

02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:38.920
I think UK is neutral

02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:40.920
maybe France might have something better

02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:42.920
MRE

02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:44.920
clogs your intestines

02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:46.920
oh no does it

02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:48.920
I don't know

02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:50.920
oh like space food just add water yeah

02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:52.920
like space food we can try space food

02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:54.920
as well when we try the MRE kits

02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:56.920
rating MRE kits live cam

02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:58.920
I just rate it and then like

02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:00.920
say like a bunch of like stereotypical stuff

02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:02.920
about the nation that I'm rating

02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:04.920
um

02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:06.920
my life wouldn't change if a zombie apocalypse

02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:08.920
happens just close

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:10.920
in the house to it for seven

02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:12.920
yeah I really like the idea of

02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:14.920
dehydration food because

02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:16.920
it lasts years which is

02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:18.920
just a mind boggling thing

02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:20.920
to me like I absolutely love the concept

02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:22.920
of it um

02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:24.920
I just

02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:26.920
find it so fascinating that we could

02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:28.920
preserve foods like if you think

02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:30.920
of our ancestors who had to live

02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:32.920
on a yearly crop basis

02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:34.920
and like if your crops were

02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:36.920
messed up you were in trouble you had

02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:38.920
to find a trade quick like if

02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:40.920
you were a lumberjack and you cut wood

02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:42.920
or you sold

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.920
I don't know you sold yourself

02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:46.920
but that trade really didn't

02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:48.920
uh still doing it today baby

02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:50.920
keeping

02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:52.920
my ancestors proud

02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:54.920
um if they're lumber

02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:56.920
um probably fire could chop

02:12:56.920 --> 02:12:58.920
in probably root harvesting

02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:00.920
like harvesting mushrooms from a forest

02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:02.920
like if you knew what ones didn't hurt you

02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:04.920
um it's like

02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:06.920
4800 calories shoved into

02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:08.920
a box I wouldn't be surprised

02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:10.920
wait really maybe I should eat our MREs

02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:12.920
cause

02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:14.920
I don't eat properly recently

02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:16.920
I've been really strong I don't

02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:18.920
no ehh ehh ehh ehh ehh ehh

02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:20.920
reflin reflin reflin

02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:22.920
do not tape

02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:24.920
doom

02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:26.920
do not tape doom

02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:28.920
I will talk to you openly

02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:30.920
and honestly I've been struggling

02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:32.920
to eat a little bit until

02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:34.920
things settle down

02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:36.920
I'm very happy to

02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:38.920
say my A-bomb has calmed down

02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:40.920
it has calmed down

02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:42.920
it was preventing me

02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:44.920
from eating properly

02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:46.920
basically

02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:48.920
I could start eating but then I got

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:50.920
adrenaline burst which stops

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:52.920
me from eating cause I'm not hungry when I get

02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:54.920
an adrenaline burst

02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:56.920
but I'm very thankful to say it's subsiding

02:13:56.920 --> 02:13:58.920
I've managed to eat a bit better

02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:00.920
recently

02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:02.920
but no doom

02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:04.920
no doom

02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:06.920
ok

02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:08.920
9.2

02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:10.920
oh we are doing it we're doing it

02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:12.920
the stack is going to be gone by the end of the stream

02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:14.920
mark my words

02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:16.920
you keep activating our worry mode which is why

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:18.920
like I

02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:20.920
what level are you now I'm level

02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:22.920
62

02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:24.920
62 which is fantastic

02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:26.920
no doom here we're only winning

02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:28.920
glad to hear you're eating but yes

02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:30.920
so I because now the girls

02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.920
are getting monetized I feel

02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:34.920
a lot of relief

02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:36.920
a lot of like

02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:38.920
all of it off my shoulders cause

02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:40.920
I was worried that the designs

02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:42.920
that I had given Shibi and Azura

02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:44.920
are going to prevent them from earning

02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:46.920
money for a month but it's not

02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:48.920
happening I'm so happy to say

02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:50.920
it's not happening cause Shibi got monetized

02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:52.920
which is absolutely fan

02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:54.920
fantadelastic truly

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:56.920
fantastic

02:14:56.920 --> 02:14:58.920
I am very happy about that

02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:00.920
please take care of yourself

02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:02.920
yes I am doing thanks

02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:04.920
still feels like doom stop it

02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.920
reflying stop it no doom

02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:08.920
it was because

02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:10.920
I was so worried about monetization

02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:12.920
because

02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:14.920
the girls

02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:16.920
I've kind of said it

02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:18.920
a lot of them are wanting to

02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:20.920
move out

02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:22.920
and I think it's actually very

02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:24.920
possible

02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:26.920
for the first month but we needed

02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:28.920
youtube monetization just to really

02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:30.920
elevate it

02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:32.920
and the thing with youtube monetization

02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:34.920
as well is that the vods can be

02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:36.920
the vods

02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:38.920
the streams like if someone

02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:40.920
watches back the stream

02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:42.920
well the girls get like some of the money

02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:44.920
from the ads as well so it's like generated

02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:46.920
free income you do not have to actually

02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:48.920
physically you know

02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:50.920
hand over money to the girls

02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:52.920
because you generate money

02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:54.920
for free watching their asmr's

02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:56.920
their asmr's are going to go up shortly

02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:58.920
and I forgot to do mercedes

02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:00.920
I'll need to give mercedes hers that's what I'm doing

02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:02.920
I'll put emmy and ac's membership live

02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:04.920
and I'll put mercedes meme video

02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:06.920
unlisted so she can upload it whenever she

02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:08.920
desires

02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:10.920
and I'm gonna doom no no no

02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:12.920
no don't doom

02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:18.920
I have about a tiny speck of doom

02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:20.920
why would you doom everything is going so well

02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:22.920
the girls are getting monetized

02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:24.920
emmy and ac are about to do their celebration

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:26.920
mercedes celebration was

02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:28.920
fantastic

02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:30.920
someone was gifting her 50 bombs

02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:32.920
which was insane

02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:34.920
no dooming on main literally

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.920
no dooming on main

02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:38.920
everything is just gone

02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:40.920
so fantastic

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:42.920
I tweeted out like thank you for 5k

02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:44.920
and I was saying like all that self-doubt

02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:46.920
and everything is just melting away

02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:48.920
which is true it has

02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:50.920
generate money for free

02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:52.920
yes oh my god

02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:54.920
please don't ever feel bad if you

02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:56.920
can't genuinely give money

02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:58.920
you don't understand

02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:00.920
you interacting with posts

02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:02.920
you're promoting them more in the algorithm

02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:04.920
you're watching their asmr

02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:06.920
if you watch an ad

02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:08.920
the girl gets money

02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.920
for that

02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:12.920
it is just

02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:14.920
please don't ever worry if you can't handle

02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:16.920
money

02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:18.920
I always say like oh I'm always streaming

02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:20.920
for free you don't have to be a member

02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:22.920
the membership streams start up next week

02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:24.920
but you don't have to be a member

02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.920
to consume at all

02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:28.920
type thingy

02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:30.920
scrawny I care about you and the girls too much

02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:32.920
I'm always gonna worry

02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:34.920
no you're sounding like me

02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:36.920
I was worrying over them

02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:38.920
I was like full mummy mode

02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:40.920
thankfully I got an 8 hour sleep

02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:42.920
last night

02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:44.920
oh my god

02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:46.920
why I probably sound

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:48.920
a bit tired

02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:50.920
I woke up at the last possible minute

02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:52.920
for stream not because I don't

02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:54.920
love you because you guys always go

02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:56.920
mummy's late she doesn't love us anymore

02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:58.920
no I

02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:00.920
took medicine to put my ass to sleep

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:02.920
and I got a full

02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:04.920
8 hours and I'm so freaking glad

02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:06.920
I got a full 8 hours I'm like

02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:08.920

02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:10.920
it feels so good to get a full 8 hours

02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.920
to sleep

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.920
but yeah

02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:16.920
mummy loves us

02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:18.920
is the mercy meme video

02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:20.920
be a problem did youtube unlist it

02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:22.920
no it's not out yet

02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:24.920
I need to upload it to her channel because

02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:26.920
I subtitled all the meme videos

02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:30.920
63

02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:32.920
63

02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:34.920
63

02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:36.920
edgeville bank

02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:38.920
that was to the theme of 64 zoo lane

02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:40.920
which is a british TV show

02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:42.920
or was I don't know if they make new

02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:44.920
episodes but yeah

02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:46.920
so if we

02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:48.920
like commenting streams

02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:50.920
that helps yeah it helps like

02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:52.920
immensely like so

02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:54.920
to give you an example

02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:56.920
ic does an

02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:58.920
ASMR stream

02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:00.920
you like that stream

02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:02.920
and then emmy does an ASMR stream

02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:04.920
you like that stream

02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:06.920
youtube algorithm goes

02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:08.920
hmm there's a connection between

02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:10.920
these two girls they've both done

02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:12.920
ASMR and this viewer both enjoyed

02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:14.920
them to leave a like

02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:16.920
and then the algorithm goes

02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:18.920
hmm this

02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:20.920
other youtube user

02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:22.920
both enjoyed these two girls

02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:24.920
I'm going to start recommending this

02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:26.920
user these girls

02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:28.920
em and then it's kind

02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:30.920
of a knock on effect so

02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:32.920
em

02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:34.920
youtube will recommend

02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:36.920
someone who's never consumed

02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:38.920
ic's ASMR before

02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:40.920
because they liked emmy's

02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:42.920
ASMR and then

02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:44.920
that also goes further ahead to

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:46.920
other vtuber ASMRist for example

02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:48.920
the algorithm is like

02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:50.920
an insane tangled

02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:52.920
spider web of a mess

02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:54.920
em

02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:56.920
and anything you do will

02:19:56.920 --> 02:19:58.920
affect it so for

02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:00.920
example

02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:02.920
if you go on twitter right now

02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:04.920
and you type in emmy bezu

02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:06.920
and it'll pop up her twitter

02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:08.920
you've just affected your algorithm on youtube

02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:10.920
because unfortunately

02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:12.920
em websites completely

02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:14.920
cross platform everything whatever

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:16.920
you type in even if you go to

02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:18.920
rule 34 and type in

02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:20.920
the girls name you are

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:22.920
you will affect the results

02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:24.920
of your youtube browsing experience

02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:26.920
because of what you've typed

02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:28.920
in on other websites as well

02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:30.920
em

02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:32.920
it goes

02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:34.920
very deep but unfortunately

02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:36.920
your websites are all interconnected

02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:38.920
whether or not you want to

02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:40.920
whether or not you say like no to

02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:42.920
cookies no to this they are connected

02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:44.920
it's undeniable em

02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:46.920
does youtube listen

02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:48.920
in the chat too so youtube

02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:50.920
will see

02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:52.920
you interacting with me on chat and it'll

02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:54.920
say this user like

02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:56.920
strony well em funny

02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:58.920
enough this other vtuber

02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:00.920
is like strony i will recommend

02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:02.920
this person strony

02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:04.920
another version of strony type

02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:06.920
thing em sorry i'm not very good

02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:08.920
with my words at the moment em

02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:10.920
we'll probably

02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.920
we'll do a tinkle and a refuel

02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:14.920
at the 3 hour mark em

02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:16.920
i'm definitely going to make another tea

02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:18.920
and i'm going to get some yummy yummy snacks

02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:20.920
em

02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:22.920
i bought

02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:24.920
a nature valley bar and i'm like

02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:26.920
is that the worst snack to eat on stream

02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:28.920
there's just going to be dust everywhere

02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:30.920
are you stop looking at me misspelling

02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:32.920
your name how can you not

02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:34.920
strony kettles

02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.920
strony

02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:38.920
kettles

02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:40.920
strony kettles

02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:42.920
how can you spell it wrong

02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:44.920
but yeah like literally

02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:46.920
if you go on twitter

02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:48.920
and you search

02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:50.920
vealour

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:52.920
again you're manipulating the algorithm

02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:54.920
when you go on youtube

02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:56.920
you'll probably have a few more vealour streams

02:21:56.920 --> 02:21:58.920
recommended to you on your page

02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:00.920
or down the sidebar

02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:02.920
because the algorithm knows

02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:04.920
that you have an interest in vealour

02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:06.920
it goes so deep

02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:08.920
unfortunately cookies are just

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:10.920
websites are such liars being like

02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:12.920
we don't track you via cookies

02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:14.920
only the essential ones you

02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:16.920
liar you liar it's just

02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:18.920
the way the internet is these days

02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:20.920
we're just such shame but

02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:22.920
em

02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:24.920
for the last week

02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:26.920
i've been getting ads regarding the scotland

02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:28.920
honestly

02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:30.920
come visit scotland

02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:32.920
this scotland tourism industry

02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:34.920
come to edum

02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:36.920
actually i think edum

02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:38.920
is the most expensive than glasgo

02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:40.920
although it's probably

02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:42.920
it's such a small amount

02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:44.920
of difference

02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:46.920
so if we're watching like scottish youtubers

02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:48.920
we should get more scottish youtubers

02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:50.920
em

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:52.920
i actually don't know about getting

02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:54.920
really super rare

02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:56.920
imma just say this on behalf of all

02:22:56.920 --> 02:22:58.920
scottish vtubers right now

02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:00.920
a lot has to go wrong in your life

02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:02.920
in order to become a scottish

02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:04.920
vtuber

02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:06.920
now to become a vtuber in general

02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:08.920
that's perfectly normal if you're any other nationality

02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:10.920
if you're scottish

02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:12.920
and a vtuber

02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:14.920
bruh whatever happened in your life

02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:16.920
i feel for you hen so if you're a scottish vtuber

02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:18.920
listening in i feel for you hen

02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:20.920
don't worry i went through it too

02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:22.920
ha ha

02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:24.920
you know

02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:26.920
i am only

02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:28.920
aware of two other scottish

02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:30.920
vtubers unfortunately

02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:32.920
they are not for me

02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:34.920
content wise

02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:36.920
definitely not for me but that's just

02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:38.920
my yeah that's just me being me

02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:40.920
em

02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:42.920
definitely not on the same page

02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:44.920
when it comes to

02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:46.920
thought process

02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:48.920
or like how we were raised

02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:50.920
and all that

02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:52.920
you can kinda tell when you hear someone talk

02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:54.920
you can kinda tell

02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:56.920
the way they've been raised in scotland

02:23:56.920 --> 02:23:58.920
which sounds terrible

02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:00.920
sounds almost classic but i'm not trying to be like that

02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:02.920
i'm just trying to be like

02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:04.920
i don't know

02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:06.920
you can

02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:08.920
tell when someone doesn't gear

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:10.920
and then you can tell when someone geyser

02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:12.920
and i'm much better with

02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:14.920
people who don't need geyser

02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:16.920
you know

02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:18.920
if i infect other people's algorithm

02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:20.920
em

02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:22.920
i suppose the only way

02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:24.920
you can do it

02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:26.920
oh we're almost at 8k

02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:28.920
is

02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:30.920
by posting

02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:32.920
youtube shorts in particular

02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:34.920
in locations where it's appropriate

02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:36.920
so just say you're in a general vtuber fan discord

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:38.920
if someone were to

02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:40.920
watch that short fully

02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:42.920
you have successfully infected them

02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:44.920
algorithm wise

02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:46.920
em

02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:48.920
because they consumed

02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:50.920
that content it's fascinating

02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:52.920
honestly i actually am quite

02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:54.920
interested in the infection

02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:56.920
side of it but yes

02:24:56.920 --> 02:24:58.920
you can successfully infect someone

02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:00.920
the vealor virus

02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:02.920
em

02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:04.920
em

02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:08.920
em so i just

02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:10.920
wrote that comment

02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:12.920
yes you can affect someone by doing that

02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:14.920
if they have never consumed vealor content

02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:16.920
em

02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:18.920
but you maybe make clips

02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:20.920
of the girls and they click it for the first time

02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:22.920
because they got recommended or you post

02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:24.920
in a discord that's appropriate to post

02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:26.920
the vtuber stuff or maybe

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:28.920
a vtuber reddit

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.920
actually there i think there's

02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:32.920
so

02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:34.920
vealor do have the vealor reddit

02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:36.920
but it's not being publicly posted yet

02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:38.920
but i sh

02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:40.920
i don't know i mean literally i was just gonna

02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:42.920
do everyone's oh sorry

02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:44.920
this is why i can't talk and think at the same time

02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:46.920
em

02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:48.920
there is a possibility of just posting it for memes

02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:50.920
but we were gonna have to put it on approved

02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:52.920
posts only

02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:54.920
because it can get nasty pretty quickly

02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:56.920
em

02:25:56.920 --> 02:25:58.920
and i do not want any of the girls to be

02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:00.920
subjected to anything

02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:02.920
nasty

02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:04.920
let's go infect some replaying

02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:06.920
i have no idea what you're saying

02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:08.920
but i'll take your word for it thank you

02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:10.920
is edinburgh a bad place no it's not

02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:12.920
it's just more

02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:14.920
rich

02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:16.920
and sometimes rich people

02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:18.920
are not very empathetic

02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:20.920
em but that was such

02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:22.920
a mean and nasty generalization

02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:24.920
when i say rich people i'm talking like

02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:26.920
multi-billionaires

02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:28.920
multi-billionaires type stuff rich

02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:30.920
em the average do everyone's

02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:32.920
empathetic to one another each other

02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:34.920
but if you're not very empathetic please don't worry

02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:36.920
i'm actually gonna do an educational stream

02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:38.920
on human nature and empathy

02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:40.920
empathy is a practice behaviour

02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:42.920
you need to practice empathy to get it

02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:44.920
you need to

02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:46.920
flip the switch and be able to

02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:48.920
have abstract thoughts about empathy

02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:50.920
as a whole

02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:52.920
and i'm actually going to challenge you guys

02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:54.920
and i'm going to make up scenarios

02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:56.920
where you need to be empathetic

02:26:56.920 --> 02:26:58.920
and you need to give me a reason why you feel empathetic

02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:00.920
but i'm going to make the scenario

02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:02.920
super hard so at a glance

02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:04.920
you're like that's disgusting behaviour

02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:06.920
that's

02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:08.920
but

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:10.920
but we have to learn

02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:12.920
to be empathetic and we have to think

02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:14.920
about why the person

02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:16.920
may have behaved that way

02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:18.920
it'll be an interesting

02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:20.920
concept either the stream will go terrible

02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:22.920
and everyone can laugh at it which is fine

02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:24.920
i don't mind you guys are allowed to laugh at my

02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:26.920
stream ideas because i have a pretty bizarre

02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:28.920
concept sometimes

02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:30.920
oh man we have a place like that too

02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:32.920
in Milan never got Milan

02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:34.920
so it's like London but smaller and prettier

02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:36.920
yeah it's pretty old

02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:38.920
there's a lot of older architecture

02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:40.920
Edinburgh is turning people

02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:42.920
into an English city in regards to the most posh people

02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:44.920
i definitely

02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:46.920
feel more comfortable in Glasgow

02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:48.920
and good old Glasgow

02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:50.920
mutual comfy

02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:52.920
disgusting and

02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:54.920
i'm going to pull the lever

02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:56.920
and make everything worse

02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:58.920
what does that mean

02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:00.920
the Scottish accents kind of come from

02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:02.920
yeah so

02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:04.920
the more slang you speak

02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:06.920
statistically the more povo you are

02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:08.920
and it's completely normal

02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:10.920
to be in poverty in Scotland

02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:12.920
the statistics

02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:14.920
are 1 in 5 children

02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:16.920
are growing up in poverty

02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:18.920
however i actually think the statistics

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:20.920
is probably going to be 1 in 3 now

02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:22.920
so it's

02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:24.920
completely normal to be

02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:26.920
impoverished when you grow up

02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:28.920
it's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary

02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:30.920
anyone's rich type ideal

02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:32.920
i like that

02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:34.920
i like human psychology

02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:36.920
that sounds pretty interesting

02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:38.920
are you trying to get us to empathize with some scoundrels

02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:40.920
no nothing bad

02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:42.920
but i want to

02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:44.920
oh no

02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:46.920
oh no the fire

02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:48.920
wait let me pick up the ashes

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:50.920
i will clear

02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:52.920
oh no you've already cleared the campsite for me

02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:54.920
thank you refling

02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:12.920

02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:28.920

02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:32.920
honestly i love this game

02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:34.920
that's so good

02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:36.920
i heard a lot of good stuff about glassy

02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:38.920
yes firepog

02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:40.920
flames yes

02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:42.920
um

02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:44.920
is currently british english only a thing

02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:46.920
wait sorry isn't current british english

02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:48.920
only a thing because they didn't want to be associated

02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:50.920
with the nobility of the plague

02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:52.920
yes there is a very

02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:54.920
viral clip that

02:29:54.920 --> 02:29:56.920
a guy is being interviewed

02:29:56.920 --> 02:29:58.920
um

02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:00.920
and

02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:02.920
oh god what was the word

02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:04.920
i can see the interview in my head

02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:06.920
it's an english interview

02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:08.920
and the guy

02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:10.920
speaks what we call

02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:12.920
posh english

02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:14.920
and then the guy replies

02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:16.920
tomorrow that's it

02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:18.920
the guy goes like tomorrow

02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:20.920
and then the guy replies tomorrow

02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:22.920
it's like not trying to correct him

02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:24.920
but he's trying to be like wow

02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:26.920
look at the difference in this regional accent

02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:28.920
but the problem

02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:30.920
with it

02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:32.920
it's not that problematic relax before you're like

02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:34.920
well steady on you've got blue hair haven't you

02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:36.920
nah relax i ain't got blue hair

02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:38.920
calm it fenny's in on the opposite of me

02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:40.920
um

02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:42.920
the kind of thing was it

02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:44.920
is because posh english accents

02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:46.920
are associated with wealth

02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:48.920
are associated with grammar schools

02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:50.920
for example a grammar school is

02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:52.920
a rich person school

02:30:52.920 --> 02:30:54.920
high education school

02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:56.920
public education is kind of

02:30:56.920 --> 02:30:58.920
associated with not necessarily

02:30:58.920 --> 02:31:00.920
pro but if you can't afford public education

02:31:00.920 --> 02:31:02.920
you can't afford it

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:04.920
um

02:31:04.920 --> 02:31:06.920
so the guy was like oh

02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:08.920
look at this accent

02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:10.920
this man clearly

02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:12.920
you know wasn't educated

02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:14.920
in a grammar school type thing and that's

02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:16.920
when it becomes a wee bit of an issue

02:31:16.920 --> 02:31:18.920
uh received pronunciation

02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:20.920
uh

02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:22.920
it's them also calling it the queens english

02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:24.920
yeah just finding out

02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:26.920
it's not glass

02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:28.920
wait glass go

02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:30.920
it's a shame

02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:32.920
it's fine if you accidentally name a city wrong

02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:34.920
like edinburgh

02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:36.920
and edinburgh is normally pronounced

02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:38.920
edinburgh

02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:40.920
by folk who don't come from here

02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:42.920
that's perfectly normal

02:31:42.920 --> 02:31:44.920
i'm sure i say all these

02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:46.920
applications in different countries wrong as well

02:31:46.920 --> 02:31:48.920
like arkansas

02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:50.920
is arkansas and like

02:31:50.920 --> 02:31:52.920
mississippi and

02:31:52.920 --> 02:31:54.920
what's another state in america

02:31:54.920 --> 02:31:56.920
um road islands

02:31:56.920 --> 02:31:58.920
um colorado

02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:00.920
i'm sure i say it funny so please

02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:02.920
don't ever be embarrassed if you say it funny

02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:04.920
um glass go is said glass go

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:06.920
but in the

02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:08.920
regional dialect it can also be

02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:10.920
glazga um

02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:12.920
don't ask why it's glazga it just

02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:14.920
glazga um

02:32:14.920 --> 02:32:16.920
texas yeah i'm sure i'll say

02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:18.920
uh i don't know

02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:20.920
if there's some locations

02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:22.920
in the states that i can name

02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:24.920
uh anaheim

02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:26.920
is a place in

02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:28.920
california because they

02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:30.920
hold conventions

02:32:30.920 --> 02:32:32.920
i'm pretty sure there was some

02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:34.920
anaheim convention at one point

02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:36.920
if i ever visit the uk i'll go to

02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:38.920
glazga honestly it's

02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:40.920
like such a nice although edinburgh

02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:42.920
is pretty good for tourist stuff like

02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:44.920
the edinburgh castle and

02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:46.920
the edinburgh museum are pretty close together

02:32:46.920 --> 02:32:48.920
um

02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:50.920
did you say wheels is

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:52.920
associated with posh no wheels

02:32:52.920 --> 02:32:54.920
in wheels wheels

02:32:54.920 --> 02:32:56.920
is associated with kind of like the mining

02:32:56.920 --> 02:32:58.920
towns and all of that and the

02:32:58.920 --> 02:33:00.920
the welsh accent

02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:04.920
what is the welsh accent

02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:08.920
i can't think of a welsh uh sentence

02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:10.920
specifically to start the accent

02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:14.920
have you had a coke and rum please

02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:16.920

of welsh accent i have

02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:20.920
is this little

02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:22.920
britain skit where the guy's like

or that lass like type thing and he's like

02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:34.920
i'm the only gay in the village that's the only

02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:36.920
exposure to the welsh accent

02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:38.920
to be honest which is absolutely terrible

02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:40.920
um all of a sudden

02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:42.920
we're drifting up to the northern island

02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:44.920

02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:52.920
cooking up a storm with swordfish

02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:54.920

getting higher i'm leveling up

02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:04.920
wheels is associated with sheep

02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:06.920
i will tell you the reason why wheels are

02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:08.920
associated with sheep it was

02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:10.920
elite well it's illegal to

02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:12.920
steal a farmer's sheep it

02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:14.920
wasn't at the time many a year

02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:16.920
ago to um to

02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:18.920
have um

02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:20.920
actions with a sheep

02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:22.920
which is why

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:24.920
people would pretend

02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:26.920
that they had had action

02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:28.920
with a sheep instead

02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:30.920
of stealing it because you can't

02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:32.920
get arrested for actions but you could

02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:34.920
get arrested for stealing at the time

02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:36.920
okay that is why

02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:38.920
poor welsh people have to deal with

02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:40.920
that stereotype and it's such a shame

02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:44.920
um because it's not true you just

02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:46.920
need to know a little bit of history to understand

02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:48.920
a little bit more

02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:50.920
abridonians profusely

02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:52.920
sweating aye what is it abridine

02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:54.920
abridine can he kick her jelly

02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:58.920
absolutely short in behaviour

02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:00.920
stealing was the death penalty

02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:02.920
yes okay that would be it

02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:04.920
it was even more severe than i originally

02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:06.920
had anticipated

02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:08.920
i shan't be in scottish i'm getting

02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:10.920

02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:20.920
because of each of our agency

02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:22.920
reasons you'll have to forgive me but

02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:24.920

02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:08.920
someone's getting banned

02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:10.920
shawnee had to reveal

02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:14.920

collars do you have a heart rate monitor

02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:30.920
by the way i was gonna wear my heart rate monitor

02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:32.920
so you can literally see my heart spike

02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:34.920
every time you go

02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:36.920

you're not exhausted by the end of it honestly

02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:52.920
i'd be shattered after like 30 seconds of

02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:54.920
moving around i'd be like right that's all i've got time for

02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:56.920
it's been nice reflans but i gotta go

02:36:56.920 --> 02:36:58.920

02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:00.920
band check no

02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:02.920

02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:04.920
oh no i'm

02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:06.920

02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:08.920
i don't even know how big we're

02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:10.920
gonna get it done

02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:14.920
sin will always be

02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:16.920
a reflans

02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:18.920
did you kicked my

02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:20.920
toenail off the wall a few times

02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:22.920
um

02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:24.920
what a

02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:26.920
what's your community name again because i remember

02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:28.920
when i when i saw you getting started

02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:30.920
it had been

02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:32.920
named something

02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:34.920
but i don't know if you're still named

02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:36.920
that and i don't want to say the name

02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:38.920
okay it's imps now okay

02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:40.920
it was something else

02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:42.920
um it was something else

02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:44.920
way at the start and i didn't want to

02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:46.920
say it obviously

02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:48.920
can suspicion i know he's getting banned

02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:50.920
just do a couple of them clapping

02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:52.920
with no hands audio sounds like

02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:54.920
you got a good workout and brah

02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:56.920
i was so out of breath recording

02:37:56.920 --> 02:37:58.920
that like horrifically

02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:00.920
out of breath

02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:02.920
like you can literally here we go

02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:04.920
like

02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:06.920
clap clap clap clap clap clap

02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:08.920
basically i was

02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:10.920
so bad

02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:12.920
i was so bad

02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:16.920
man

02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:18.920
what level did i just get 64

02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:20.920
64

02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:22.920
wait why can i not kick this

02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:24.920
yes oh my god it was

02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:26.920
64

02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:30.920
it was suggested

02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:32.920
sin cells that was it i didn't

02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:34.920
yeah i'm pretty sure it's an incel

02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:36.920
and um

02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:38.920
what's that other word simp

02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:40.920
like a ban phrase on twitch now

02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:42.920
do they still do that do they still

02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:44.920
moderate that

02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:46.920
i remember it got banned and i was like

02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:48.920
isn't that

02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:50.920
like i don't like the word simp

02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:52.920
because i feel like it's used anytime

02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:54.920
where a guy just genuinely enjoys content

02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:56.920
from a girl which is so like it's quite

02:38:56.920 --> 02:38:58.920
frustrating because it's just like

02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:00.920
i don't like the terminology

02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:02.920
but to like outright ban it

02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:04.920
is like what did i miss a few

02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:06.920
yeah twitch doesn't allow those words

02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:08.920
but i've never really tested it out

02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:12.920
you can get banned for it that's pretty

02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:14.920
um

02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:16.920
yeah like i'm pretty tired of the

02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:18.920
word simp because i think it's used whenever

02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:20.920
someone just genuinely enjoys content

02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:22.920
that just happens to be from a chick like it's

02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:24.920
really

02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:26.920
but anyway i think outright ban in it is like

02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:28.920
a bit severe i just hope

02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:30.920
that the definition

02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:32.920
slowly changes over time did someone just

02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:34.920
talk there no

02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:36.920
maybe later oh wait was that for me

02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:38.920
oh my god i wasn't paying attention

02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:40.920
ebes was that for me

02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:44.920
uh

02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:46.920
the moderation

02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:48.920
is inconsistent say the least

02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:50.920
yeah it's why i don't really enjoy

02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:52.920
twitch a lot of people right why not

02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:54.920
twitch why not twitch but i have seen countless

02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:56.920
examples of what

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:58.920
how they don't apply the rules

02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:00.920
fairly at least with youtube

02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:02.920
it does seem like

02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:04.920
a overall blanket

02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:06.920
which is very easy

02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:08.920
to be like oh okay right because

02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:10.920
like um now i'm aware

02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:12.920
that you're looking isn't allowed now

02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:14.920
i don't know why

02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:16.920
older videos that are made eons back

02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:18.920
are fine but recently not

02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:20.920
no like azura was eating

02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:22.920
a cookie azura

02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:24.920
was eating a cookie and she got

02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:26.920
a warning for um enjoying

02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:28.920
a cookie just because her voice is so

02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:30.920
silky smooth um

02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:34.920
it's definitely being generalized to any sort of kindness

02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:36.920
towards a person but especially women

02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:38.920
yeah like it's why

02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:40.920
i'm i'm pretty tired of hearing about it

02:40:40.920 --> 02:40:42.920
to be honest like i think it's overstate

02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:44.920
it's welcome to because it just

02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:46.920
gets used to oh you enjoy

02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:48.920
any type of content from women

02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:50.920
and it's like bro

02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:52.920
i'm just here to enjoy the runescape streams

02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:54.920
like my god i'm here to enjoy the rambles

02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:56.920
and how we're going to take down

02:40:56.920 --> 02:40:58.920
the big banks um

02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:02.920
i prefer youtube twitch

02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:04.920
reason sub prices oh my gosh

02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:06.920
yes at least with youtube you

02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:08.920
can decide on membership price i

02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:10.920
see that as if i didn't begrudgingly

02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:12.920
raise my price by a dollar of

02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:14.920
pure rage but i will make it up

02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:16.920
i will do as much streaming

02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:18.920
as i can to to earn that money

02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:20.920
um

02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:22.920
but yeah twitch

02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:24.920
just seems to be taking

02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:26.920
a sin moving to youtube

02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:28.920
if you type in

02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:30.920
twitch that you're

02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:32.920
an age you get by

02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:34.920
100% yeah

02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:36.920
it was a very

02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:38.920
mmm mmm cookie indeed

02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:40.920
can't eat a cookie on stream

02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:42.920
youtube is really crumbling apart

02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:48.920
thank you thank you i came up with

02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:50.920

02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:00.920
no no i came up with that joke

02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:02.920
myself i promise it totally

02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:04.920
totally wasn't uh

02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:06.920
how is she looking how is she looking

02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:08.920
sideways is she supposed to be looking

02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:10.920
sideways

02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:12.920
i just really she's never looking

02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:14.920
why are you looking

02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:16.920
to the side i know maybe she got

02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:18.920
like a sore neck or something that's okay

02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:24.920
yeah i didn't miss the

02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:26.920
yeah

02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:28.920
it turns out all i had to do was open

02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:30.920
the application in order for it to make

02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:32.920
noise i accidentally

02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:34.920
closed it the other time i tried it

02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:36.920
and couldn't figure out why

02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:38.920
she's so shy she can't look us in the eyes

02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:40.920
honestly like look into my eyes

02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:42.920
not around my eyes

02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:44.920
yeah

02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:46.920
it's like when you see a guy call someone

02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:48.920
a simple watching girl and then you look

02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:50.920
and they watch some big muscle male streamer

02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:52.920
for nine hours a day but that doesn't

02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:54.920
count

02:42:54.920 --> 02:42:56.920
allegedly glorkin hard

02:42:56.920 --> 02:42:58.920
on it but

02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:00.920
he's a whammin bad but male

02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:02.920
good

02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:04.920
bruv we're tired

02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:06.920
bruv let's just enjoy let's just enjoy the

02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:08.920
conspiracy through okay let's just enjoy him

02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:10.920
if it makes you

02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:12.920
a simp for listening to me

02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:14.920
coconut my cheeks

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:16.920
and make them clap for 15 minutes

02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:18.920
and hey ho

02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:20.920
then hey ho

02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:22.920
snakes and stones may may break

02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:24.920
my bones but you'll never get

02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:26.920
more quality content

02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:28.920
from another streamer

02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:30.920
when it comes to ASMR no that's a lie

02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:32.920
that's a lie

02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:34.920
oh 8.6

02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:36.920
8.6

02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:38.920
bronze

02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:40.920
my issue with twitch at the moment is

02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:42.920
something about the vtuber

02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:44.920
yes that was a recent tos update

02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:46.920
if you did not hear the news

02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:48.920
vtubers now

02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:50.920
must

02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:52.920
conform

02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:54.920
to the attire

02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:56.920
rules of in real life streamers

02:43:56.920 --> 02:43:58.920
but the problem with that is a lot

02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:00.920
of vtuber models you know

02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:02.920
they have a bit of appeal to them

02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:04.920
a bit of personality on show if you will

02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:06.920
and because of twitch

02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:08.920
is incant who goes there

02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:10.920
inconsistencies

02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:12.920
it's very hard to ascertain

02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:14.920
if

02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:16.920
if

02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:18.920
oops sorry whoa

02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:20.920
how do I do that

02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:22.920
hold on I'm just gonna check

02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:24.920
if any of the girls

02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:26.920
are streaming

02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:28.920
please

02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:30.920
be advised

02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:32.920
that shibi

02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:34.920
cajun boom

02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:36.920
is live with vampire

02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:38.920

02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:52.920
and also holding in her

02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:54.920
urea

02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:56.920
there are 2 other

02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:58.920
vealer members live right now

02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:00.920
please do not be worried

02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:02.920
if you cannot watch us all

02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:04.920
once I heavily recommend watching

02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:06.920
the other girls first

02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:08.920
because I am locking in

02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:10.920
an endurance stream today

02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:12.920
thank you very much vealer mods

02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:14.920
please do not speak ever again

02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:16.920
actually you know what mod appreciation

02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:18.920
and ironically

02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:20.920
I do appreciate all your hard efforts mods

02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:22.920
thank you as much as I am a little meme lord

02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:24.920
please do not

02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:26.920
I've locked in for a 12 hour stream

02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:28.920
you will not see me offline

02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:30.920
until 11 hours and 55 minutes

02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:32.920
cause that is exactly when the vod breaks

02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:34.920
em

02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:36.920
so please do not be afraid to watch

02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:38.920
my gen mates and enjoy them

02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:40.920
and then you are welcome to

02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:42.920
come back to me at any time

02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:44.920
whoa this person got gardening

02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:46.920
gardening isn't got

02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:48.920
a freaking cabbage on your back

02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:50.920
aww you got green cakes

02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:52.920
aww I forgot to buy his green cakes

02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:54.920
we should probably buy green cakes

02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:56.920
aren't the twitch attire standards

02:45:56.920 --> 02:45:58.920
based on what you are? doesn't that mean vtuber

02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:00.920
need to... yeah so

02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:02.920
on twitch

02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:04.920
you can stream in a bikini

02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:06.920
if you are in a pool

02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:08.920
or a hot tub

02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:10.920
so that is like saying I could pop

02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:12.920
up on my bikini toggle right now

02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:14.920
and put like a hot tub asset

02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:16.920
and then I am good to go question mark

02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:18.920
like that seems pretty redundant

02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:20.920
em I will close that cause it is kind of

02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:22.920
covering up

02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:26.920
em

02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:28.920
don't forget that twitch has the hot tub category

02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:30.920
which is only worth watching

02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:32.920
when some insane guy in a lab coat

02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:34.920
show oh no the fire

02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:36.920
we got so distracted

02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:38.920
we got so distracted talking about the

02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:40.920
um

02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:42.920
let me take the ashes

02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:44.920
so they don't get in the way

02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:46.920
I thought ashes got in the way of cooking

02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:48.920
am I going crazy did I make that up

02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:50.920
fire

02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:52.920
thank you much

02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:54.920
more depreciation

02:46:54.920 --> 02:46:56.920
I completely forgot what I was saying

02:46:56.920 --> 02:46:58.920
in real life youtube is

02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:00.920
barely having a time I feel like they get away with

02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:02.920
anything

02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:04.920
youtube is definitely more

02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:06.920
wait am I dumb

02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:08.920
youtube is definitely

02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:10.920
so much nicer than me

02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:12.920
em

02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:14.920
it's just the facts bro

02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:16.920
I'm sorry you can argue

02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:18.920
to a wall cause my burn rate

02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:20.920
keeps going up

02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:22.920
stop

02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:24.920
stop burning

02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:26.920
you shouldn't be burning

02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:28.920
em

02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:30.920
I'm here for the long haul

02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:32.920
oh yeah you got endurance for 12 hours

02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:34.920
abusing mods

02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:36.920
streamer abusing mods

02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:38.920
but they like it though

02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:42.920
don't you mods

02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:44.920
but you can't speak

02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:46.920
this is a one sided conversation

02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:50.920
em

02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:52.920
I think all the girls got extra mods

02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:54.920
by the way so do check your discord

02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:56.920
or whatever you applied with

02:47:56.920 --> 02:47:58.920
I have no idea I didn't handle the mods

02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:00.920
so if you got picked as a mod congrats

02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:02.920
wasn't it me

02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:04.920
em

02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:06.920
but do check cause I think

02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:08.920
3 people didn't respond

02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:10.920
even though they were super keen

02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:12.920
em

02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:14.920
twitch

02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:16.920
admins have their favourite

02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.920
mods and shambles

02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:20.920
tell me about the dude with the lab coat

02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:22.920
in the bikini

02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:24.920
wait is that real

02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:26.920
gotta get your hair blow up

02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:28.920
there are potions to help you last

02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:30.920
longer

02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:32.920
oh my god that's terrible

02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:34.920
mods aren't real they're like birds

02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:36.920
post what you want

02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:38.920
alright I do have mods

02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:40.920
we need to keep things above board

02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:42.920
ok

02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:44.920
another mod flexing on you

02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:46.920
by deleting your message

02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:48.920
lmao

02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:50.920
and slap

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:52.920
I don't know what the lab coat thing is though

02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:54.920
twitch feels better

02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:56.920
as a dedicated streaming site

02:48:56.920 --> 02:48:58.920
but the actual infrastructure management is awful

02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:00.920
yeah I would say discoverability

02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:02.920
on youtube

02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:04.920
is so much better

02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:06.920
in my opinion especially

02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:08.920
with the shorts algorithm

02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:10.920
I would say on twitch the only

02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:12.920
way I could

02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:14.920
you know foresee

02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:16.920
someone

02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:18.920
em

02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:20.920
fore fore see

02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:24.920
foresee someone being

02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:26.920
em

02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:28.920
discovered

02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:30.920
is the raid option

02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:32.920
which is called redirect on youtube

02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:34.920
if you get

02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:36.920
a streamer that is kind enough

02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:38.920
and is massive and raids into you

02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:40.920
it can literally

02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:42.920
make or break you as a streamer

02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:44.920
it's pretty insane it really is

02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:46.920
em

02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:48.920
I have told the girls please

02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:50.920
to always raid into each other

02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:52.920
to keep a train going

02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:54.920
if no other talent

02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:56.920
is online then you're more than welcome

02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:58.920
to raid into another agency

02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:00.920
no problem at all

02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:02.920
like I

02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:04.920
yesterday called in a favour

02:50:04.920 --> 02:50:06.920
with a friend

02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:08.920
mimosa

02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:10.920
was it yesterday?

02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:12.920
no it must have been the other day

02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:14.920
she was so polite

02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:16.920
and I said look I'll raid into you

02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:18.920
but do me a favour when you finish up your stream

02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:20.920
raid back into a violour girl

02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:22.920
and she said that is more than happy

02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:24.920
with those terms and I was like yeah

02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:26.920
I'm more than happy calling a favour for a friend

02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:32.920
yes I

02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:34.920
absolutely don't mind it at all

02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:36.920
the v and u girls have been absolutely

02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:38.920
fantastic some of them have been

02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:40.920
raiding into me I actually need to start

02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:42.920
messaging some of them and being like hey you have

02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:44.920
3d o microphone question mark question mark

02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:46.920
em

02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:48.920
I still find the violour mentality

02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:50.920
of mods please do this thing thank you

02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:52.920
now please be quiet affectionately

02:50:54.920 --> 02:50:56.920
yes em

02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:58.920
it's very

02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:00.920
I don't want to say jarring

02:51:00.920 --> 02:51:02.920
em but for someone

02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:04.920
who may be new to stream

02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:06.920
and

02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:08.920
the streamer

02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:10.920
is having a repertoire

02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:12.920
but a back and forth with mods

02:51:12.920 --> 02:51:14.920
that are named it's a bit not

02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:16.920
isolated but it's like

02:51:16.920 --> 02:51:18.920
it feels like you've missed out on lore

02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:20.920
and it just gets harder to enjoy the streamer

02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:22.920
like someone could be lurking watching

02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:24.920
me for the first time right now

02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:26.920
em and just being like

02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:28.920
was she all about type thing and if I'm like

02:51:28.920 --> 02:51:30.920
oh mod x mod this mod y

02:51:30.920 --> 02:51:32.920
mod b mod c and like

02:51:32.920 --> 02:51:34.920
cracking like you jokes all the time

02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:36.920
em like it's not

02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:38.920
very

02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:40.920
enabling to come in for the first

02:51:40.920 --> 02:51:42.920
time

02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:44.920
em whereas I quite

02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:46.920
like the mods don't speak

02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:48.920
but we are incredibly appreciative

02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:50.920
for you you know mopping

02:51:50.920 --> 02:51:52.920
mopping the floors

02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:54.920
and making sure everything is good to go in

02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:56.920
stream yaw

02:51:56.920 --> 02:51:58.920
em

02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:00.920
do shorts still work for discovery

02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:02.920
emory said they

02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:04.920
attached dead people to the channel

02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:06.920
no

02:52:06.920 --> 02:52:08.920
emy isn't entirely wrong

02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:10.920
but she isn't entirely right

02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:12.920
shorts

02:52:12.920 --> 02:52:14.920
definitely have a subscription

02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:16.920
subscriber count

02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:18.920
effect

02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:20.920
em and they also have discoverability

02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:22.920
effect

02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:24.920
not all shorts people

02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:26.920
who will subscribe to you will show up in a

02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:28.920
live stream that's just facts

02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:30.920
some people purely enjoy shorts

02:52:30.920 --> 02:52:32.920
mind rot and they will just

02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:34.920
watch shorts and nothing else that's

02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:36.920
perfectly fine so emy is both

02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:38.920
right and both a wee bit wrong

02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:40.920
it's very good em I do

02:52:40.920 --> 02:52:42.920
have

02:52:42.920 --> 02:52:44.920
brah I have three

02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:46.920
shorts editors and all three

02:52:46.920 --> 02:52:48.920
of them are busy for a couple of weeks

02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:50.920
and I could absolutely smash their faces

02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:52.920
because I need help I don't have

02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:54.920
editing skills

02:52:54.920 --> 02:52:56.920
em I think I'm going to have to reach

02:52:56.920 --> 02:52:58.920
out to an editor that I like

02:52:58.920 --> 02:53:00.920
to style of

02:53:00.920 --> 02:53:02.920
because I'm drowning

02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:04.920
I need help with shorts and I do not

02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:06.920
have the skills for it nor do I

02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:08.920
have the time for it but I'm

02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:10.920
now that the girls are monetized I'm wanting

02:53:10.920 --> 02:53:12.920
to

02:53:12.920 --> 02:53:14.920
close through em I'm wanting

02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:16.920
to start pushing out shorts for the

02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:18.920
baby girls now em to help

02:53:18.920 --> 02:53:20.920
with overall sub count

02:53:20.920 --> 02:53:22.920
we are going to put some advertisements

02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:24.920
into the shorts as well so

02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:26.920
some might have more views and others

02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:28.920
and we'll take it from there

02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:30.920
look it's just a kind of

02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:32.920
em my current goal once

02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:34.920
everyone has done their celebration monetization

02:53:34.920 --> 02:53:36.920
stream is my current goals I'm going to

02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:38.920
get everyone to 5k subscribers

02:53:38.920 --> 02:53:40.920
em

02:53:40.920 --> 02:53:42.920
which

02:53:42.920 --> 02:53:44.920
shouldn't really be

02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:46.920
too hard

02:53:46.920 --> 02:53:48.920
em I do have a collab

02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:50.920
ASMR that's going to go on AC's

02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:52.920
channel em which should help

02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:54.920
boost her a little bit em

02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:56.920
because the culling was just so

02:53:56.920 --> 02:53:58.920
65

02:53:58.920 --> 02:54:00.920
wait we're going to approach the naughty

02:54:00.920 --> 02:54:02.920
number soon

02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:04.920
any naughty number approaches me

02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:06.920
em

02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:08.920
new viewers feel like they are walking

02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:10.920
into a friend group yes

02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:12.920
it definitely

02:54:12.920 --> 02:54:14.920
em

02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:16.920
especially whenever I

02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:18.920
kind of

02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:20.920
talk I like to say

02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:22.920
oh I spoke about this yesterday but

02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:24.920
don't worry if you weren't there

02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:26.920
because it's also quite

02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:28.920
nice and kind language to use

02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:30.920
for people who may genuinely

02:54:30.920 --> 02:54:32.920
who couldn't have been there

02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:34.920
em

02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:36.920
types of how do I keep

02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:38.920
doing that I don't know how I keep doing that

02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:40.920
I'm being such a silly bully with that

02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:42.920
em whoa

02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:44.920
8.4 okay at 8000

02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:46.920
I will call a break

02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:48.920
and I'm going to pee get a cup of tea

02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:50.920
get some snacks em

02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:52.920
and hopefully Gimli doesn't

02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:54.920
come flying into the room the moment I open

02:54:54.920 --> 02:54:56.920
the door but I think she may

02:54:56.920 --> 02:54:58.920
em

02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:00.920
if the streamer is only talking to their moz

02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:02.920
that's fault the rest of the chat

02:55:02.920 --> 02:55:04.920
your sub count will be inflated

02:55:04.920 --> 02:55:06.920
but it's still a net positive it's a positive

02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:08.920
overall I

02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:10.920
I'm happy to see this publicly I

02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:12.920
really want to get play buttons for the girls

02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:14.920
I think

02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:16.920
I would absolutely love that

02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:18.920
em

02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:20.920
it'll take time

02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:22.920
it will take hard work it'll take dedication

02:55:22.920 --> 02:55:24.920
but em

02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:26.920
I will show the girls what

02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:28.920
is working for me what has worked what is

02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:30.920
working em and

02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:32.920
you know

02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:34.920
if they do shorts with me if they do

02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:36.920
ASMR collabs with other girls

02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:38.920
em if they do

02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:40.920
zoom collabs with the girls

02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:42.920
em I think it is very

02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:44.920
possible I actually

02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:46.920
do not see it as an impossibility

02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:48.920
if the girls let me cook and

02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:50.920
equally they also cook

02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:52.920
em I think it would be

02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:54.920
absolutely lovely to get the girls play buttons

02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:56.920
and before anyone

02:55:56.920 --> 02:55:58.920
asks is Veeler holding the play buttons

02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:00.920
eh no

02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:02.920
why I'll say it again

02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:04.920
I

02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:06.920
would never

02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:08.920
ever hold

02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:10.920
a beautiful symbol

02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:12.920
of their hard work their dedication

02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:14.920
their love for their craft

02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:16.920
their love for their community

02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:18.920
from the girl

02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:20.920
absolutely not pointing fingers

02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:22.920
but

02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:24.920
I think it is very clear

02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:26.920
there is

02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:28.920
corporate greedy agencies

02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:30.920
that care about accolades

02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:32.920
to prevent them

02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:34.920
from to prevent their talents

02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:36.920
from holding such a beautiful symbol

02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:38.920
and then there are

02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:40.920
agencies like Veeler that says do whatever you want

02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:42.920
here's the money

02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:44.920
basically here do

02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:46.920
you want have fun here's your money

02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:48.920
here's your play button

02:56:48.920 --> 02:56:50.920
em yes

02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:52.920
you don't want the play button on your

02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:54.920
giant mega yacht no

02:56:54.920 --> 02:56:56.920
I absolutely do not

02:56:56.920 --> 02:56:58.920
care for that

02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:00.920
right I have to ask I actually don't know

02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:02.920
if it's real I only hear it from the memes

02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:04.920
is the yacht real is there actually

02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:06.920
a yacht or is it or is it just a meme

02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:10.920
hello do you plan on playing

02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:12.920
Titanfall 2 absolutely

02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:14.920
it's a fantastic game

02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:16.920
I would love to give it a

02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:18.920
a shot

02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:20.920
for the first time as Stronu Cuddles

02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:22.920
meh meh meh

02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:24.920
and we can see BT

02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:26.920
together and this time

02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:28.920
I will get uppies from the correct BT

02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:30.920
and not an enemy that

02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:32.920
freaked me out because I could have sworn

02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:34.920
it was

02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:36.920
nah it's a meme

02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:38.920
okay it's a meme okay I thought it was real

02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:40.920
I thought it was actually

02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:42.920
real and someone was like oh my god

02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:44.920
this person owns an actual yacht on the

02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:46.920
back of these VTubers hard

02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:48.920
work and

02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:50.920
I don't know who it is

02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:52.920
you know who you are

02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:54.920
whoever keeps telling me

02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:56.920
to save the blue one

02:57:56.920 --> 02:57:58.920
I can't

02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:00.920
my guy for one

02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:02.920
and two LaMalle

02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:04.920
you're starting to

02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:06.920
I'm starting to think you're just daily

02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:08.920
asking that in my Marshmallow

02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:10.920
so I keep bringing it up

02:58:10.920 --> 02:58:12.920
I cannot save anyone

02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:14.920
I cannot save them all

02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:16.920
but those who seek

02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:18.920
the violor route

02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:20.920
I will do anything and everything

02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:22.920
in my power to help you

02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:24.920
achieve your dreams

02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:26.920

02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:28.920

I am happy to

02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:32.920

02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:34.920
for the underdog

02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:36.920
and I think

02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:38.920
you should too always root for the underdog

02:58:38.920 --> 02:58:40.920

entire job surrounds reading and writing isn't

03:03:00.920 --> 03:03:02.920
that hilarious and I get to be smug about

03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:04.920
it because it's like oh well

03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:06.920
it worked out so far even though I can't

03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:08.920
do it properly

03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:10.920
but I

03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:12.920

what if I search Azura

03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:22.920

her full name we've only been out

03:03:26.920 --> 03:03:28.920
for a week the algorithm isn't going to know you're

03:03:28.920 --> 03:03:30.920
asking for Azura delay the VTuber

03:03:30.920 --> 03:03:32.920
you have to type Azura as a

03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:34.920

03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:50.920

I simply type the surname with the double

03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:54.920
L that's the problem

03:03:54.920 --> 03:03:56.920

Pinterest

03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:06.920

03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:14.920
VTuber names and then came up with that

03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:16.920
by the way strongy since I never

03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:18.920

it is a slow incremental

03:04:24.920 --> 03:04:26.920
game although it well depends

03:04:26.920 --> 03:04:28.920
on how you want to play it I

03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:30.920
am literally just cooking

03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:32.920

the bar slowly go up

03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:46.920

03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:48.920
and I get dopamine

03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:50.920
every time I says I level up in the game

03:04:50.920 --> 03:04:52.920
it's gorgeous I just can't help it

03:04:54.920 --> 03:04:56.920
I'mma be real I'm not even here for the

03:04:56.920 --> 03:04:58.920
gameplay I'm here for rambling while I play Isaac

03:04:58.920 --> 03:05:00.920
I thought about doing Eden Isaac

03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:02.920
runs shortly

03:05:02.920 --> 03:05:04.920
for like a shorter stream idea

03:05:04.920 --> 03:05:06.920
if you didn't know the most

03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:08.920
Isaac runs last one hour

03:05:08.920 --> 03:05:10.920
so I thought maybe for a shorter stream

03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:12.920
I would purposely do a four hour

03:05:12.920 --> 03:05:14.920
stream so I can redirect into Emmy

03:05:14.920 --> 03:05:16.920
because I never redirect

03:05:16.920 --> 03:05:18.920
into Emmy I finally got to redirect

03:05:18.920 --> 03:05:20.920
into Azura yesterday

03:05:20.920 --> 03:05:22.920
and but I never do it

03:05:22.920 --> 03:05:24.920
for Emmy and I can never do it

03:05:24.920 --> 03:05:26.920
for Icy unless I pulled an all

03:05:26.920 --> 03:05:28.920
nighter I might pull an all nighter

03:05:28.920 --> 03:05:30.920
so I can say I redirected into

03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:32.920
Icy just to be a smug little about it

03:05:34.920 --> 03:05:36.920
but I wanted to do

03:05:36.920 --> 03:05:38.920
a four hour stream so I can redirect into Emmy

03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:40.920
at one point because poor Emmy never gets

03:05:40.920 --> 03:05:42.920
redirected in my reeflings

03:05:42.920 --> 03:05:44.920
are never exposed to Emmy

03:05:44.920 --> 03:05:46.920
and what sentence

03:05:46.920 --> 03:05:48.920
I didn't even mean that sometimes I mean it

03:05:48.920 --> 03:05:50.920
when I say sentences and sometimes the

03:05:50.920 --> 03:05:52.920
sentences just have happened

03:05:52.920 --> 03:05:54.920
I thought dropping T was an American tip

03:05:54.920 --> 03:05:56.920
not the harbor

03:05:56.920 --> 03:05:58.920
don't remind me of all

03:05:58.920 --> 03:06:00.920
that beautiful tea

03:06:02.920 --> 03:06:04.920
this is a preparation but she cooking

03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:06.920
for real for me

03:06:06.920 --> 03:06:08.920
everybody feeding the fire to keep up

03:06:08.920 --> 03:06:10.920
yes special thank you to the reeflings

03:06:10.920 --> 03:06:12.920
that are just helping stock a fire

03:06:12.920 --> 03:06:14.920
this is making this go

03:06:14.920 --> 03:06:16.920
so fast like so so fast

03:06:16.920 --> 03:06:18.920
so thank you for all your help

03:06:18.920 --> 03:06:20.920
I do appreciate it greatly

03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:22.920
ummm

03:06:22.920 --> 03:06:24.920
but yes

03:06:24.920 --> 03:06:26.920
okay say no more I'm sold

03:06:26.920 --> 03:06:28.920
and yeah Isaac all day every day

03:06:28.920 --> 03:06:30.920

03:06:30.920 --> 03:06:32.920
November stream sniping week

03:06:32.920 --> 03:06:34.920
I'm not even kidding I want to play Isaac

03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:36.920
back to back to back to back to back to

03:06:36.920 --> 03:06:38.920
12 hour endurance

03:06:38.920 --> 03:06:40.920
I've not done that

03:06:40.920 --> 03:06:42.920
oh no I would have to do all my

03:06:42.920 --> 03:06:44.920
membership streams in one go

03:06:44.920 --> 03:06:46.920
unless I make a deal

03:06:46.920 --> 03:06:48.920
with membership people

03:06:48.920 --> 03:06:50.920
hello scrawny

03:06:50.920 --> 03:06:52.920
first time chatting just came here from

03:06:52.920 --> 03:06:54.920
shebeestream hi harem

03:06:54.920 --> 03:06:56.920
she wasn't holding up

03:06:56.920 --> 03:06:58.920
no she has a migraine

03:06:58.920 --> 03:07:00.920
I honestly I don't know

03:07:00.920 --> 03:07:02.920
what reason she has a migraine for

03:07:02.920 --> 03:07:04.920
because I'm pretty sure migraines have no

03:07:04.920 --> 03:07:06.920
rhyme or reason but I'm like 99%

03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:08.920
sure she was crying

03:07:08.920 --> 03:07:10.920
happy tears might have affected it and she

03:07:10.920 --> 03:07:12.920
maybe is pretty dehydrated right now

03:07:12.920 --> 03:07:14.920
ummm

03:07:14.920 --> 03:07:16.920

to pick their emotes now I'm not going to ruin

03:07:56.920 --> 03:07:58.920

the girls get to hold the rates to their IPs

03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:44.920

bruv I don't know why my leg is sore all of a sudden

03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:10.920
I doubt I pulled a muscle sitting

03:09:10.920 --> 03:09:12.920
on my leg the way I usually do

03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:14.920
I don't normally do any of that

03:09:14.920 --> 03:09:16.920
I love you too

03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:18.920

03:09:28.920 --> 03:09:30.920
back off okay

03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:32.920
maybe clapping with no hands

03:09:32.920 --> 03:09:34.920
contributed to it

03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:36.920
no I actually did that about

03:09:36.920 --> 03:09:38.920
a week ago

03:09:38.920 --> 03:09:40.920
I think

03:09:40.920 --> 03:09:42.920
about a week ago

03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:46.920

03:09:58.920 --> 03:10:00.920

03:10:00.920 --> 03:10:02.920

03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:08.920
literally I am too busy

03:10:08.920 --> 03:10:10.920
to die I'm not even being funny

03:10:10.920 --> 03:10:12.920
have you ever heard those stories where

03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:14.920
people are like in a coma and they're like

03:10:14.920 --> 03:10:16.920
close to passing away but then they go

03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:18.920
like I'm sorry I can't die right now

03:10:18.920 --> 03:10:20.920
like my family member is going to be

03:10:20.920 --> 03:10:22.920
pfft or like oh

03:10:22.920 --> 03:10:24.920
I'm too busy to die right now and then

03:10:24.920 --> 03:10:26.920
they wake up from the coma

03:10:26.920 --> 03:10:28.920
have you ever heard those stories they're pretty

03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:30.920
crazy you can't do

03:10:30.920 --> 03:10:32.920
that I was caught by surprise away

03:10:32.920 --> 03:10:34.920
I worked

03:10:34.920 --> 03:10:36.920

03:10:44.920 --> 03:10:46.920
I'm not going to say too much

03:10:46.920 --> 03:10:48.920
because I want to respect my

03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:50.920
my girls my gen ones I've obviously

03:10:50.920 --> 03:10:52.920
doing a lot cooking actually that remains

03:10:52.920 --> 03:10:54.920
many to go ask for a collaboration from another

03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:56.920
VTuber and I have no idea if they're going to accept

03:10:56.920 --> 03:10:58.920
they might accept they might not

03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:00.920
hey ho we'll try

03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:04.920
currently gen 2 is cooking

03:11:04.920 --> 03:11:06.920
and yeah no I'm not naming

03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:08.920
them you'll be happy to know

03:11:08.920 --> 03:11:10.920
I'm not naming them

03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:12.920
but it's very

03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:14.920
busy trying to maintain everything

03:11:14.920 --> 03:11:16.920
all at once

03:11:18.920 --> 03:11:20.920
but I did say I'm a workaholic

03:11:20.920 --> 03:11:22.920
and I really

03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:24.920
enjoy working I

03:11:24.920 --> 03:11:26.920
enjoy giving value for money as well

03:11:26.920 --> 03:11:28.920
especially in this day and age

03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:30.920
where everything's getting

03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:32.920
greedier and greedier I'm like no

03:11:32.920 --> 03:11:34.920
we're going to do a business tactic

03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:36.920
called undercut in the market

03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:38.920
yay

03:11:38.920 --> 03:11:40.920
undercut undercut

03:11:40.920 --> 03:11:42.920
that kind of thing

03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:44.920
damn the hey ho gets moved

03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:46.920
hey ho let me finish

03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:48.920
my point now

03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:50.920
I really like pushing myself

03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:52.920
to offer value for money

03:11:52.920 --> 03:11:54.920
it's why even with membership

03:11:54.920 --> 03:11:56.920
streams like on days where we do a membership stream

03:11:56.920 --> 03:11:58.920
I'm still going to do a cheeky 2 over stream

03:11:58.920 --> 03:12:00.920
for it

03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:02.920
and then we can enjoy our

03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:04.920
more cuddly membership streams

03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:06.920
I have absolutely no issue with that

03:12:06.920 --> 03:12:08.920
it doesn't bother me none

03:12:08.920 --> 03:12:10.920
and life is good

03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:12.920
we are bingchining

03:12:12.920 --> 03:12:14.920
bingchining

03:12:14.920 --> 03:12:16.920
undercut in the market

03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:18.920
love

03:12:18.920 --> 03:12:20.920
as I said a bit earlier

03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:22.920
but for the harem

03:12:22.920 --> 03:12:24.920
that might not have been here when I was rambling about it

03:12:24.920 --> 03:12:26.920
I was saying that even if you

03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:28.920
cannot physically give any money

03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:30.920
to the creator you're watching

03:12:30.920 --> 03:12:32.920
just liking the stream

03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:34.920
or subscribing to them

03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:36.920
or just hanging out and lurking

03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:38.920
all of this contributes

03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:40.920
to the algorithm and leads for the girls

03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:42.920
to more success

03:12:42.920 --> 03:12:44.920
especially vaude watchers

03:12:44.920 --> 03:12:46.920
special shout out to vaude watchers

03:12:48.920 --> 03:12:50.920
especially if the girl streams

03:12:50.920 --> 03:12:52.920
in a not good time zone for you

03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:54.920
if you go into

03:12:54.920 --> 03:12:56.920
mersey's comment section

03:12:56.920 --> 03:12:58.920
there's like one dedicated vaude watcher

03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:00.920
and I'm like you are helping her out so much

03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:02.920
I understand

03:13:02.920 --> 03:13:04.920
watching live stream vaudes

03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:06.920
is not the funnest thing

03:13:06.920 --> 03:13:08.920
because the person isn't live

03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:10.920
but a lot of you are saying

03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:12.920
you kind of listen to me ramble in the background

03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:14.920
that is perfect

03:13:14.920 --> 03:13:16.920
because you engage

03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:18.920
with the content for long periods of time

03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:20.920
again boosting the algorithm

03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:22.920
for the girl

03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:24.920
having cross promotion

03:13:24.920 --> 03:13:26.920
with the vealer girls

03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:28.920
it's just fantastic

03:13:28.920 --> 03:13:30.920
it really is

03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:32.920
12 hours of content for free that is value

03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:34.920
yes like I don't mind it

03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:36.920
now it's absolutely

03:13:36.920 --> 03:13:38.920
it's not I'm very serious when I say this

03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:40.920
this is absolutely not a reflection

03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:42.920
on any other

03:13:42.920 --> 03:13:44.920
VTuber streamer whoever whatever

03:13:44.920 --> 03:13:46.920
I

03:13:46.920 --> 03:13:48.920
do not find

03:13:48.920 --> 03:13:50.920
this to be a job

03:13:50.920 --> 03:13:52.920
okay this is

03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:54.920
fun I'm enjoying myself

03:13:54.920 --> 03:13:56.920
I am breaking my voice

03:13:56.920 --> 03:13:58.920
rambling to you talking about

03:13:58.920 --> 03:14:00.920
all these plans I've got cooking

03:14:00.920 --> 03:14:02.920
talking about how things are

03:14:02.920 --> 03:14:04.920
like this doesn't feel a job

03:14:04.920 --> 03:14:06.920
feel like a job and I feel

03:14:06.920 --> 03:14:08.920
sorry for streamers

03:14:08.920 --> 03:14:10.920
where it does feel like a job

03:14:10.920 --> 03:14:12.920
and they can't publicly come out

03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:14.920
and be like that

03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:16.920
wow 66

03:14:18.920 --> 03:14:20.920
maybe that should be my

03:14:20.920 --> 03:14:22.920
donation

03:14:22.920 --> 03:14:24.920
like a tip sound instead of

03:14:24.920 --> 03:14:26.920
are you squiddin me right now although actually

03:14:26.920 --> 03:14:28.920
I quite like are you squiddin me right now

03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:30.920
no thanks

03:14:30.920 --> 03:14:32.920
to the time stampers

03:14:32.920 --> 03:14:34.920
oh yes special thank you to time stampers as well

03:14:34.920 --> 03:14:36.920
VOD watchers

03:14:36.920 --> 03:14:38.920
for any of the girls this applies

03:14:38.920 --> 03:14:40.920
to any of the girls seriously

03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:42.920
you

03:14:42.920 --> 03:14:44.920
do not go unnoticed especially

03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:46.920
on ASMR stream

03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:48.920
time stamping on

03:14:48.920 --> 03:14:50.920
ASMR streams is very good for

03:14:50.920 --> 03:14:52.920
me

03:14:52.920 --> 03:14:54.920
because I do have plans to

03:14:54.920 --> 03:14:56.920
clip the girls ASMR

03:14:56.920 --> 03:14:58.920
I'm currently

03:14:58.920 --> 03:15:00.920
in talks with someone to do it for me

03:15:00.920 --> 03:15:02.920
but the problem

03:15:02.920 --> 03:15:04.920
is you know the profits

03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:06.920
aren't the profits won't be there

03:15:06.920 --> 03:15:08.920
for the clipping ASMR thing but

03:15:08.920 --> 03:15:10.920
you know what we'll get there

03:15:10.920 --> 03:15:12.920
all of the

03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:14.920
violour girls are perfect for background

03:15:14.920 --> 03:15:16.920
noise you all have very beautiful voices

03:15:16.920 --> 03:15:18.920
oh thank you

03:15:18.920 --> 03:15:20.920
I'm sure all of us appreciate such a kind

03:15:20.920 --> 03:15:22.920
comment like I love her mixer voices

03:15:22.920 --> 03:15:24.920
accents all of that

03:15:24.920 --> 03:15:26.920
17

03:15:26.920 --> 03:15:28.920
1700

03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:30.920
to go wait what's

03:15:30.920 --> 03:15:32.920
1700 to go the fish

03:15:32.920 --> 03:15:34.920
oh no

03:15:34.920 --> 03:15:36.920
wait what's 1700 to go

03:15:36.920 --> 03:15:38.920
clipping ASMR

03:15:38.920 --> 03:15:40.920
ASMR is a good idea yes ASMR

03:15:40.920 --> 03:15:42.920
is a very popular category

03:15:42.920 --> 03:15:44.920
so

03:15:44.920 --> 03:15:46.920
did Emmy get the right route

03:15:46.920 --> 03:15:48.920
pin pals and Emmy

03:15:48.920 --> 03:15:50.920
did you get the right route

03:15:50.920 --> 03:15:52.920
did you get the right route I said

03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:54.920
route instead of route

03:15:54.920 --> 03:15:56.920
hi Emmy hi pin pals

03:15:56.920 --> 03:15:58.920
don't worry you don't have to talk too much because I think you're

03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:00.920
bursting out the seams so please feel free

03:16:00.920 --> 03:16:02.920
to go to the toilet at any time

03:16:02.920 --> 03:16:04.920
the pin pals mouths are open

03:16:04.920 --> 03:16:06.920
we got the right route that's why

03:16:06.920 --> 03:16:08.920
that's what I raised you for

03:16:08.920 --> 03:16:10.920
that's what I birthed you from my loins for Emmy

03:16:10.920 --> 03:16:12.920
that's my Emmy

03:16:12.920 --> 03:16:14.920

03:16:20.920 --> 03:16:22.920
Emmy saying that

03:16:22.920 --> 03:16:24.920
the pin pals

03:16:24.920 --> 03:16:26.920
are not giving her permission to tinkle

03:16:26.920 --> 03:16:28.920
pin pals

03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:30.920

03:19:56.920 --> 03:19:58.920

03:20:00.920 --> 03:20:02.920

03:20:02.920 --> 03:20:04.920

03:20:10.920 --> 03:20:12.920
how are you a higher level than me

03:20:12.920 --> 03:20:14.920
we can't be

03:20:14.920 --> 03:20:16.920
we flinger at a higher level than me

03:20:16.920 --> 03:20:18.920
yes

03:20:18.920 --> 03:20:20.920
t-minus

03:20:20.920 --> 03:20:22.920

03:20:22.920 --> 03:20:24.920
t-minus 3 hours for stray

03:20:26.920 --> 03:20:28.920
and then

03:20:28.920 --> 03:20:30.920
snippets

03:20:30.920 --> 03:20:32.920
warning in 5 hours for harvester

03:20:32.920 --> 03:20:34.920
who is putting

03:20:34.920 --> 03:20:36.920
are we getting drunk hold on

03:20:36.920 --> 03:20:38.920
hold on hold on hold on

03:20:38.920 --> 03:20:40.920
let me drop this

03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:42.920
let me get drunk right now

03:20:42.920 --> 03:20:44.920
oh that actually made

03:20:44.920 --> 03:20:46.920
i love that noise

03:20:46.920 --> 03:20:48.920
we flings you're allowed

03:20:48.920 --> 03:20:50.920
to go take a drink if you like

03:20:52.920 --> 03:20:54.920
right let's use it on the fire

03:20:54.920 --> 03:20:56.920
did you

03:20:56.920 --> 03:20:58.920
select the funny all bell

03:20:58.920 --> 03:21:00.920
on the sub button exactly

03:21:00.920 --> 03:21:02.920
i don't see azura's stream

03:21:02.920 --> 03:21:04.920
i didn't display for me either

03:21:04.920 --> 03:21:06.920
i only displayed mercies there

03:21:06.920 --> 03:21:08.920
i

03:21:08.920 --> 03:21:10.920
i am under the impression

03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:12.920
that we are going to

03:21:12.920 --> 03:21:14.920
be added to holodex

03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:16.920
soon which is a website

03:21:16.920 --> 03:21:18.920
which will

03:21:18.920 --> 03:21:20.920
list all of our streams

03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:22.920
and automatically do it to your time

03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:24.920
zone

03:21:24.920 --> 03:21:26.920
so

03:21:28.920 --> 03:21:30.920
that will be coming soon

03:21:30.920 --> 03:21:32.920
if i'm not mistaken

03:21:36.920 --> 03:21:38.920
i don't know how it works

03:21:38.920 --> 03:21:40.920
but it means that it will auto show you

03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:42.920
everyone's stream

03:21:42.920 --> 03:21:44.920
violor we did consider running our own

03:21:44.920 --> 03:21:46.920
website but

03:21:46.920 --> 03:21:48.920
it was like another expense

03:21:48.920 --> 03:21:50.920
that you know what holodex does it

03:21:50.920 --> 03:21:52.920
for free and i'd rather

03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:54.920
put any expenses like back into the girls

03:21:54.920 --> 03:21:56.920
back into shorts back into promotion

03:21:58.920 --> 03:22:00.920
there is for those

03:22:00.920 --> 03:22:02.920
pin pals that are listening in

03:22:02.920 --> 03:22:04.920
and any snowberries

03:22:04.920 --> 03:22:06.920
there may or may not be an asmr

03:22:06.920 --> 03:22:08.920
coming

03:22:08.920 --> 03:22:10.920
for snowberries and pin pals

03:22:10.920 --> 03:22:12.920
i hope you enjoy it

03:22:12.920 --> 03:22:14.920
when it does come out

03:22:14.920 --> 03:22:16.920
but there's a little hint for you

03:22:16.920 --> 03:22:18.920
yes

03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:20.920
holodex takes an average of

03:22:20.920 --> 03:22:22.920
20k on all channels

03:22:22.920 --> 03:22:24.920
as prerequisite

03:22:24.920 --> 03:22:26.920
ok well we're coming for it

03:22:26.920 --> 03:22:28.920
for any

03:22:28.920 --> 03:22:30.920
yappening

03:22:30.920 --> 03:22:32.920
that you may have missed out on because you are watching

03:22:32.920 --> 03:22:34.920
the good ending

03:22:34.920 --> 03:22:36.920
on emmy

03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:38.920
stream

03:22:38.920 --> 03:22:40.920
long story

03:22:40.920 --> 03:22:42.920
short

03:22:42.920 --> 03:22:44.920
azura

03:22:44.920 --> 03:22:46.920
is the last one that we

03:22:46.920 --> 03:22:48.920
are waiting for monetization on

03:22:48.920 --> 03:22:50.920
and all of the girls have been

03:22:50.920 --> 03:22:52.920
successfully

03:22:52.920 --> 03:22:54.920
monetized i really started

03:22:54.920 --> 03:22:56.920
through that one

03:22:56.920 --> 03:22:58.920
and the monetization streams will be

03:22:58.920 --> 03:23:00.920
happening soon tm

03:23:00.920 --> 03:23:02.920
you can become a member as a reefling

03:23:02.920 --> 03:23:04.920
you can become a member as a snippet

03:23:04.920 --> 03:23:06.920
and tomorrow

03:23:06.920 --> 03:23:08.920
snowberries and pin pals

03:23:08.920 --> 03:23:10.920
you can also

03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:12.920
become a member

03:23:12.920 --> 03:23:14.920
because the girls are doing their membership

03:23:14.920 --> 03:23:16.920
celebration

03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:18.920
so please do not worry though

03:23:18.920 --> 03:23:20.920
the girls will always be streaming for free

03:23:20.920 --> 03:23:22.920
as well they will not be

03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:24.920
exclusively doing membership streams

03:23:24.920 --> 03:23:26.920
that's not how it works around these parts

03:23:26.920 --> 03:23:28.920
but please do look out for it

03:23:28.920 --> 03:23:30.920
because once my

03:23:30.920 --> 03:23:32.920
endurance stream ends

03:23:32.920 --> 03:23:34.920
for 12 hours i'm doing a cheeky endurance stream

03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:36.920
once my stream ends

03:23:36.920 --> 03:23:38.920
i am going to be the one pulling the strings

03:23:38.920 --> 03:23:40.920
behind the scenes and opening up membership

03:23:40.920 --> 03:23:42.920
so if you really wanted to get it

03:23:42.920 --> 03:23:44.920
before the stream you can

03:23:44.920 --> 03:23:46.920
but it's better to do it on stream

03:23:46.920 --> 03:23:48.920
because the girls will say your name

03:23:50.920 --> 03:23:52.920
do you want to hear the girls say your name

03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:54.920
don't be silly

03:23:54.920 --> 03:23:56.920
let the girls say your name

03:23:58.920 --> 03:24:00.920
my wallet isn't paying waiting for membership

03:24:00.920 --> 03:24:02.920
you can become a vill

03:24:02.920 --> 03:24:04.920
oh okay

03:24:04.920 --> 03:24:06.920
this isn't emmy in game before anyone

03:24:06.920 --> 03:24:08.920
thinks it's actually emmy

03:24:08.920 --> 03:24:10.920
that's hilarious though

03:24:10.920 --> 03:24:12.920
we've got a pin pal

03:24:12.920 --> 03:24:14.920
and they're waiting on emmy

03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:16.920
singing

03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:18.920
say mommy would you like us

03:24:18.920 --> 03:24:20.920
to send you emmy's latest deleted audio

03:24:20.920 --> 03:24:22.920
in maro what did she do

03:24:24.920 --> 03:24:26.920
what did she do

03:24:26.920 --> 03:24:28.920
what did my daughter do

03:24:30.920 --> 03:24:32.920
what did she do

03:24:32.920 --> 03:24:34.920
what did she do

03:24:34.920 --> 03:24:36.920
what did i miss

03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:38.920
peeler

03:24:38.920 --> 03:24:40.920
did she just

03:24:40.920 --> 03:24:42.920
did she just end stream

03:24:42.920 --> 03:24:44.920
and then give you the audio

03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:46.920
of the

03:24:46.920 --> 03:24:48.920
bra

03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:50.920
bra

i knew it i knew she was doing it

03:25:12.920 --> 03:25:14.920
she may or may not have been forced to

03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:16.920
i'm like

my peeler

03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:22.920
isn't going to be very fun because i

03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:24.920
hardly have any liquids

03:25:24.920 --> 03:25:26.920
i swear it from my hands and feet so much

03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:28.920
oh i need to clip that

03:25:28.920 --> 03:25:30.920
actually i need to clip that

03:25:30.920 --> 03:25:32.920
fucking part of stream where the pop rocks

03:25:32.920 --> 03:25:34.920
popped to prove how sweaty my feet are

03:25:36.920 --> 03:25:38.920
i'm probably going to have to make that clip

03:25:38.920 --> 03:25:40.920

03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:42.920

03:29:54.920 --> 03:29:56.920
i'm freaking accidentally screen recording

03:29:56.920 --> 03:29:58.920

forget to say it even though i'm live for

03:30:14.920 --> 03:30:16.920
12 hours i have 12

03:30:16.920 --> 03:30:18.920
hours to remember to say one

03:30:18.920 --> 03:30:20.920
sentence and i fail the

03:30:20.920 --> 03:30:22.920
challenge every single time you guys are

03:30:22.920 --> 03:30:24.920
just gonna have to do it in the chat for me

03:30:24.920 --> 03:30:26.920
it's kinda ridiculous um

03:30:26.920 --> 03:30:28.920
right so this is currently

03:30:28.920 --> 03:30:30.920
uh

03:30:30.920 --> 03:30:32.920
oh i guess it didn't update so you

03:30:32.920 --> 03:30:34.920
can see like all the stats wait i'll update

03:30:34.920 --> 03:30:36.920
it to the new one hold on

03:30:36.920 --> 03:30:38.920
um it didn't update too much

03:30:38.920 --> 03:30:40.920
cause i'm live

03:30:40.920 --> 03:30:42.920
boom

03:30:42.920 --> 03:30:44.920
so if you've never seen the behind the scenes before

03:30:44.920 --> 03:30:46.920
this is what it looks like when you

03:30:46.920 --> 03:30:48.920
upload a youtube video

03:30:48.920 --> 03:30:50.920
these are the statistics

03:30:50.920 --> 03:30:52.920
you get you get your viewers you get

03:30:52.920 --> 03:30:54.920
your watch time you get the subscribers that

03:30:54.920 --> 03:30:56.920
were directly earned

03:30:56.920 --> 03:30:58.920
from that video so people

03:30:58.920 --> 03:31:00.920
discovered that video for the first time and they click

03:31:00.920 --> 03:31:02.920
subscribe because they really enjoyed me

03:31:02.920 --> 03:31:04.920
pleading with you to let me hold

03:31:04.920 --> 03:31:06.920
it as much

03:31:06.920 --> 03:31:08.920
um the reason why

03:31:08.920 --> 03:31:10.920
estimated revenue is not

03:31:10.920 --> 03:31:12.920
visible is because it takes 48

03:31:12.920 --> 03:31:14.920
hours for that statistic to update

03:31:14.920 --> 03:31:16.920
if you guys really want to see it

03:31:16.920 --> 03:31:18.920
i'm more than happy to share it doesn't bother me

03:31:18.920 --> 03:31:20.920
none and

03:31:20.920 --> 03:31:22.920
i and then you guys can

03:31:22.920 --> 03:31:24.920
kind of see the fun behind the scenes but

03:31:24.920 --> 03:31:26.920
yep um that's

03:31:26.920 --> 03:31:28.920
what it looks like it says the video has got

03:31:28.920 --> 03:31:30.920
18.7

03:31:30.920 --> 03:31:32.920
51 views

03:31:32.920 --> 03:31:34.920
like subscribe smash the

03:31:34.920 --> 03:31:36.920
smash the bell member

03:31:36.920 --> 03:31:38.920
share the video yes um

03:31:38.920 --> 03:31:40.920
but yeah that

03:31:40.920 --> 03:31:42.920
that is fantastic

03:31:42.920 --> 03:31:44.920
you can see the little trend if you see that

03:31:44.920 --> 03:31:46.920
right right side trend

03:31:46.920 --> 03:31:48.920
and you can see when the video was

03:31:48.920 --> 03:31:50.920
released it had the highest view point

03:31:50.920 --> 03:31:52.920
and then now it's still actually going

03:31:52.920 --> 03:31:54.920
pretty strong it's not

03:31:54.920 --> 03:31:56.920
doing bad at all it really

03:31:56.920 --> 03:31:58.920
doesn't um

03:31:58.920 --> 03:32:00.920
but yeah i'm more than happy to show that

03:32:00.920 --> 03:32:02.920
kind of cool behind the scenes stuff

03:32:02.920 --> 03:32:04.920
you have went from 555

03:32:04.920 --> 03:32:06.920
to 5.8 the stream

03:32:06.920 --> 03:32:08.920
mmm

03:32:08.920 --> 03:32:10.920
like that video is like propelling me forward

03:32:10.920 --> 03:32:12.920
i'm hoping the same happens for the other girls

03:32:12.920 --> 03:32:14.920
meme asmr

03:32:14.920 --> 03:32:16.920
because i am not putting

03:32:16.920 --> 03:32:18.920
any advertisement money into

03:32:18.920 --> 03:32:20.920
myself i had to

03:32:20.920 --> 03:32:22.920
at debut because we kept getting

03:32:22.920 --> 03:32:24.920
called below the 1k and we needed the

03:32:24.920 --> 03:32:26.920
1k for

03:32:26.920 --> 03:32:28.920
redirecting into each other

03:32:28.920 --> 03:32:30.920
um

03:32:30.920 --> 03:32:32.920
crowd sourced

03:32:32.920 --> 03:32:34.920
self promotion

03:32:34.920 --> 03:32:36.920
question mark oh my tummy is rumbling

03:32:36.920 --> 03:32:38.920
i forgot to get some

03:32:38.920 --> 03:32:40.920
that's okay i can ramble

03:32:40.920 --> 03:32:42.920
for a bit more um

03:32:42.920 --> 03:32:44.920
but yeah

03:32:44.920 --> 03:32:46.920
i'm gonna

03:32:46.920 --> 03:32:48.920

03:32:56.920 --> 03:32:58.920
i'll repeat this story as many times as you

03:32:58.920 --> 03:33:00.920
like if i start throwing

03:33:00.920 --> 03:33:02.920
out asmr videos people

03:33:02.920 --> 03:33:04.920

03:33:04.920 --> 03:33:06.920
and then they're gonna say oh strongy cutles lives

03:33:06.920 --> 03:33:08.920
i'm gonna go listen in

03:33:08.920 --> 03:33:10.920
hold on a minute

03:33:10.920 --> 03:33:12.920
this this

03:33:12.920 --> 03:33:14.920
vtuber is ranting

03:33:14.920 --> 03:33:16.920
about how we need to take down black rock

03:33:16.920 --> 03:33:18.920
this is an asmr

03:33:18.920 --> 03:33:20.920
i'm not watching this shit live

03:33:20.920 --> 03:33:22.920
and then they'll only just watch the asmr videos

03:33:22.920 --> 03:33:24.920
and just like that

03:33:24.920 --> 03:33:26.920
i have gatekeep myself successfully

03:33:26.920 --> 03:33:28.920
because i know how to do it

03:33:28.920 --> 03:33:30.920
so you're welcome

03:33:30.920 --> 03:33:32.920
you're welcome

03:33:32.920 --> 03:33:34.920
that's right i've been sitting on this plan for a year

03:33:34.920 --> 03:33:36.920
and i will scoop it from the rooftop

03:33:36.920 --> 03:33:38.920
but that's the best part

03:33:38.920 --> 03:33:40.920
yes because people will be like i want

03:33:40.920 --> 03:33:42.920
i want asmr

03:33:42.920 --> 03:33:44.920
but you're not doing asmr live stream

03:33:44.920 --> 03:33:46.920
and it's like no no i'm not

03:33:46.920 --> 03:33:48.920
what you're gonna do about it you're gonna leave

03:33:48.920 --> 03:33:50.920
oh no my

03:33:50.920 --> 03:33:52.920
how do you call it a tight knit community

03:33:52.920 --> 03:33:54.920
oh no my tight knit community

03:33:54.920 --> 03:33:56.920
terrible we're in shambles

03:33:56.920 --> 03:33:58.920
even though i'm finding major success

03:33:58.920 --> 03:34:00.920
truly in shambles i'm on my knees

03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:02.920
but yeah you're welcome

03:34:02.920 --> 03:34:04.920
don't think that will work for long

03:34:04.920 --> 03:34:06.920
well you'll be surprised

03:34:06.920 --> 03:34:08.920
i've spoken to other asmr creators

03:34:08.920 --> 03:34:10.920
especially twitch asmr creators

03:34:10.920 --> 03:34:12.920
i had a friend

03:34:12.920 --> 03:34:14.920
who used to stream asmr

03:34:14.920 --> 03:34:16.920
and

03:34:16.920 --> 03:34:18.920
she got

03:34:18.920 --> 03:34:20.920
700 viewers

03:34:20.920 --> 03:34:22.920
concurrent on asmr

03:34:22.920 --> 03:34:24.920
and then she went and played a video game

03:34:24.920 --> 03:34:26.920
and she got 40 viewers

03:34:26.920 --> 03:34:28.920
and the entire chat

03:34:28.920 --> 03:34:30.920
was spamming

03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:32.920
someone would come in and spam when's your next asmr stream

03:34:32.920 --> 03:34:34.920
and then leave again

03:34:34.920 --> 03:34:36.920
it tried and true

03:34:36.920 --> 03:34:38.920
i'm aware this

03:34:38.920 --> 03:34:40.920
and it's gonna happen

03:34:40.920 --> 03:34:42.920
it's just

03:34:42.920 --> 03:34:44.920
facts

03:34:44.920 --> 03:34:46.920
that logic is flawed

03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:48.920
how dare you

03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:50.920
how dare you say i'm dumb

03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:52.920
even though i'm clearly dumb

03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:54.920
but i've seen it happen on twitch

03:34:54.920 --> 03:34:56.920
yeah

03:34:56.920 --> 03:34:58.920
yeah it's not that uncommon for asmr streamers to branch out

03:34:58.920 --> 03:35:00.920
yes no

03:35:00.920 --> 03:35:02.920
it's a tactic

03:35:02.920 --> 03:35:04.920
because i'm always gonna be a gamer

03:35:04.920 --> 03:35:06.920
i'm always gonna be gaming every day

03:35:06.920 --> 03:35:08.920
actually we're playing lego lord of the rings

03:35:08.920 --> 03:35:10.920
i can't keep quiet about it

03:35:10.920 --> 03:35:12.920
it's too back to back

03:35:12.920 --> 03:35:14.920
streams again

03:35:14.920 --> 03:35:16.920
i'm so excited

03:35:16.920 --> 03:35:18.920
because on the first day

03:35:18.920 --> 03:35:20.920
we play through all the missions

03:35:20.920 --> 03:35:22.920
and

03:35:22.920 --> 03:35:24.920
and

03:35:24.920 --> 03:35:26.920
get like 100%

03:35:26.920 --> 03:35:28.920
and then we get to play in middle earth and it's so fun

03:35:28.920 --> 03:35:30.920
and i'm so excited to play

03:35:30.920 --> 03:35:32.920
so yeah we get to play lego lord of the rings soon

03:35:32.920 --> 03:35:34.920
and it's like one of my top games

03:35:34.920 --> 03:35:36.920
because it's just so fun and perfect

03:35:36.920 --> 03:35:38.920
although it always glitches out at this one ice lolly place

03:35:38.920 --> 03:35:40.920
i will show you what i am always glitches out

03:35:40.920 --> 03:35:42.920
and it annoys me to high heaven

03:35:42.920 --> 03:35:44.920
because i've played the game all the time

03:35:44.920 --> 03:35:46.920
lego lord of the rings

03:35:46.920 --> 03:35:48.920
is super good lego game

03:35:48.920 --> 03:35:50.920
will you still play hobbit afterwards

03:35:50.920 --> 03:35:52.920
yes

03:35:52.920 --> 03:35:54.920
i'll play hobo

03:35:54.920 --> 03:35:56.920
4x67

03:35:56.920 --> 03:35:58.920
i'll play lego hobbit

03:35:58.920 --> 03:36:00.920
at a later date

03:36:00.920 --> 03:36:02.920
it's not my favourite because

03:36:02.920 --> 03:36:04.920
if you didn't know

03:36:04.920 --> 03:36:06.920
well now you're gonna know

03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:08.920
and insert my knowledge into your mind

03:36:08.920 --> 03:36:10.920
um

03:36:10.920 --> 03:36:12.920
lego hobbit is only 2 games long

03:36:12.920 --> 03:36:14.920
and it just

03:36:14.920 --> 03:36:16.920
abruptly ends

03:36:16.920 --> 03:36:18.920
there's no public

03:36:18.920 --> 03:36:20.920
explanation

03:36:20.920 --> 03:36:22.920
that has been released

03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:24.920
there are only theories

03:36:24.920 --> 03:36:26.920
as to why only the 2

03:36:26.920 --> 03:36:28.920
lego hobbit

03:36:28.920 --> 03:36:30.920
2 hobbit first movies

03:36:30.920 --> 03:36:32.920
were made

03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:34.920
into the lego and not the third

03:36:34.920 --> 03:36:36.920
but warner brother

03:36:36.920 --> 03:36:38.920
being shitheads

03:36:38.920 --> 03:36:40.920
it's just a mystery

03:36:40.920 --> 03:36:42.920
why the game abruptly ends

03:36:42.920 --> 03:36:44.920
at the 2 movie mark

03:36:44.920 --> 03:36:46.920
but it just

03:36:46.920 --> 03:36:48.920
is what it is

03:36:48.920 --> 03:36:50.920
so unfortunately

03:36:50.920 --> 03:36:52.920
i do not fully enjoy hobbit to the same way

03:36:52.920 --> 03:36:54.920
i enjoy lord of the rings

03:36:54.920 --> 03:36:56.920
i apologize

03:36:56.920 --> 03:36:58.920
they lost the source code

03:36:58.920 --> 03:37:00.920
no

03:37:00.920 --> 03:37:02.920
i'm pretty sure warner brothers

03:37:02.920 --> 03:37:04.920
is it warner brothers

03:37:04.920 --> 03:37:06.920
as one of them

03:37:06.920 --> 03:37:08.920
were being

03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:10.920
they were being very

03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:12.920
there was a lot of production issues

03:37:12.920 --> 03:37:14.920
with the movie hobbit and then to base

03:37:14.920 --> 03:37:16.920
something off of the movie to get the rights

03:37:16.920 --> 03:37:18.920
to do something it probably

03:37:18.920 --> 03:37:20.920
was just getting even worse

03:37:20.920 --> 03:37:22.920
the production issues on the hobbit

03:37:22.920 --> 03:37:24.920
were insane

03:37:24.920 --> 03:37:26.920
i've kinda spoken about it but peter jackson

03:37:26.920 --> 03:37:28.920
he's the director

03:37:28.920 --> 03:37:30.920
he became so violently

03:37:30.920 --> 03:37:32.920
ill

03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:34.920
tending the fire for mummy

03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:36.920
he became so violently

03:37:36.920 --> 03:37:38.920
ill

03:37:38.920 --> 03:37:40.920
he lost a bunch of weight he developed stomach ulcers

03:37:40.920 --> 03:37:42.920
honestly i felt like peter jackson

03:37:42.920 --> 03:37:44.920
when we were developing gen 1

03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:46.920
i was getting ill

03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:48.920
i honestly convinced myself at a few points

03:37:48.920 --> 03:37:50.920
i was like this is it this stomach pain i feel right now

03:37:50.920 --> 03:37:52.920
i've done it i've done it peter jackson

03:37:52.920 --> 03:37:54.920
and then got myself a freaking

03:37:54.920 --> 03:37:56.920
ulcer in my stomach

03:37:56.920 --> 03:37:58.920
do you like the hobbit

03:37:58.920 --> 03:38:00.920
yes i love the hobbit movies

03:38:00.920 --> 03:38:02.920
i love lord of the rings and hobbit movies

03:38:02.920 --> 03:38:04.920

extended so i can sing all the songs

03:38:14.920 --> 03:38:16.920
cause

03:38:16.920 --> 03:38:18.920
boffer has an amazing song

03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:20.920
when they're with the elves

03:38:20.920 --> 03:38:22.920
if i can remember the first

03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:24.920
sentence of this freaking song

03:38:24.920 --> 03:38:26.920
oh and

03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:28.920
also had a tipsy cat

03:38:28.920 --> 03:38:30.920
who played the five string fiddle

03:38:30.920 --> 03:38:32.920
he squeaked and he scored

03:38:32.920 --> 03:38:34.920
and he quickened his tune oh wait i'm skipping

03:38:34.920 --> 03:38:36.920
the lyrics someone needs to play the lyrics

03:38:36.920 --> 03:38:38.920
of boffer's song

03:38:38.920 --> 03:38:40.920
oh well

03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:42.920
there's

03:38:42.920 --> 03:38:44.920
an inn there's an inn

03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:46.920
there's a merry old inn

03:38:46.920 --> 03:38:48.920
beneath the old grey hill

03:38:48.920 --> 03:38:50.920
and there they brew a

03:38:50.920 --> 03:38:52.920
beer so brown the man on the min himself

03:38:52.920 --> 03:38:54.920
came down one night to drink his

03:38:54.920 --> 03:38:56.920
wine

03:38:56.920 --> 03:38:58.920
oh the osloor

03:38:58.920 --> 03:39:00.920
had a tipsy cat

03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:02.920
who played the five string fiddle

03:39:02.920 --> 03:39:04.920
he squeaked and he scored and he quickened his tune

03:39:04.920 --> 03:39:06.920
and the landlord

03:39:06.920 --> 03:39:08.920
shook the man on the min

03:39:08.920 --> 03:39:10.920
it's after three he said i can't remember the lyrics

03:39:10.920 --> 03:39:12.920
you'll need to put the lyrics so i can sing it but

03:39:12.920 --> 03:39:14.920
i freaking love that and i also hate

03:39:14.920 --> 03:39:16.920
em and that's

03:39:16.920 --> 03:39:18.920
what bill bull beggins hates

03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:20.920
was it

03:39:20.920 --> 03:39:22.920

and burn the corks

03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:32.920

03:39:34.920 --> 03:39:36.920

03:42:58.920 --> 03:43:00.920
turns

03:43:00.920 --> 03:43:02.920
slowly

03:43:02.920 --> 03:43:04.920
it's hard to stay

03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:06.920
say i'd rather stay awake

03:43:06.920 --> 03:43:08.920
when i'm asleep

03:43:08.920 --> 03:43:10.920
actually i'm gonna do a meme song cover

03:43:12.920 --> 03:43:14.920
you guys inspired me during

03:43:14.920 --> 03:43:16.920
my james cameron's avatar stream

03:43:16.920 --> 03:43:18.920
i am going to make

03:43:18.920 --> 03:43:20.920
a meme song cover

03:43:20.920 --> 03:43:22.920
of drumroll

03:43:22.920 --> 03:43:24.920
secret tunnel but scottish

03:43:26.920 --> 03:43:28.920
the artwork for it

03:43:28.920 --> 03:43:30.920
someone drew a meme artwork

03:43:30.920 --> 03:43:32.920
of me which i need to reach out and ask for permission

03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:34.920
to use for it

03:43:36.920 --> 03:43:38.920
but someone drew me

03:43:38.920 --> 03:43:40.920
and then in the next frame

03:43:40.920 --> 03:43:42.920
i'm blasting a scottish meme

03:43:42.920 --> 03:43:44.920
and i want to use that artwork

03:43:44.920 --> 03:43:46.920
in the music video

03:43:46.920 --> 03:43:48.920
so

03:43:48.920 --> 03:43:50.920
i'm going to see if i can do it

03:43:50.920 --> 03:43:52.920
so basically

03:43:52.920 --> 03:43:54.920
two lovers

03:43:54.920 --> 03:43:56.920
i'm gonna get someone to mix it so at least i'm not

03:43:56.920 --> 03:43:58.920
monotone deaf on it

03:43:58.920 --> 03:44:00.920
forbidden be one another

03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:02.920
and i'm actually gonna have to

03:44:02.920 --> 03:44:04.920
write the lyrics out for the music video maker

03:44:04.920 --> 03:44:06.920
because they're gonna be like

03:44:06.920 --> 03:44:08.920
what is fey

03:44:08.920 --> 03:44:10.920
from fey

03:44:12.920 --> 03:44:14.920
secret tunnel

03:44:14.920 --> 03:44:16.920
secret tunnel

03:44:16.920 --> 03:44:18.920
through the mountain

03:44:18.920 --> 03:44:20.920
secret secret

03:44:20.920 --> 03:44:22.920
secret tunnel

03:44:22.920 --> 03:44:24.920
basically it's gonna be like less than 50 seconds

03:44:24.920 --> 03:44:26.920
but i think it's funny

03:44:26.920 --> 03:44:28.920
little question for mome

03:44:28.920 --> 03:44:30.920
are we eventually going back to needy streamer

03:44:30.920 --> 03:44:32.920
overload for other endings

03:44:32.920 --> 03:44:34.920
mmm

03:44:34.920 --> 03:44:36.920
maybe a membership stream

03:44:36.920 --> 03:44:38.920
i don't want to play games

03:44:38.920 --> 03:44:40.920
i've already done before

03:44:40.920 --> 03:44:42.920
but a short game like that

03:44:42.920 --> 03:44:44.920
is very good for membership streams

03:44:44.920 --> 03:44:46.920
in my opinion and again if you're not

03:44:46.920 --> 03:44:48.920
membered and you're listening please don't worry

03:44:48.920 --> 03:44:50.920
i stream for free every single day you get free content

03:44:50.920 --> 03:44:52.920
you get content out of the wazoo with me

03:44:52.920 --> 03:44:54.920
okay just let me cook give me time

03:44:54.920 --> 03:44:56.920
i just need a bit time

03:44:56.920 --> 03:44:58.920
just need a bit of time yes

03:44:58.920 --> 03:45:00.920
give me some time

03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:02.920
yeah

03:45:02.920 --> 03:45:04.920
a bit of time

03:45:04.920 --> 03:45:06.920
wait

03:45:06.920 --> 03:45:08.920
when are you planning to do the first membership stream

03:45:08.920 --> 03:45:10.920
next

03:45:10.920 --> 03:45:12.920
week once the schedule goes up

03:45:12.920 --> 03:45:14.920
you will see the membership streams

03:45:14.920 --> 03:45:16.920
i will have it listed on

03:45:16.920 --> 03:45:18.920
the schedule there are three

03:45:18.920 --> 03:45:20.920
membership streams next week

03:45:20.920 --> 03:45:22.920
they are all at different days

03:45:22.920 --> 03:45:24.920
as well to try and enable

03:45:24.920 --> 03:45:26.920
members to try and

03:45:26.920 --> 03:45:28.920
get a little cheeky

03:45:28.920 --> 03:45:30.920
a little cheeky

03:45:30.920 --> 03:45:32.920
shot

03:45:32.920 --> 03:45:34.920
on

03:45:34.920 --> 03:45:36.920
coming to join

03:45:36.920 --> 03:45:38.920
i will vary the days as well and i'll vary the plots

03:45:38.920 --> 03:45:40.920
but it is a watch along

03:45:40.920 --> 03:45:42.920
a member ASMR

03:45:42.920 --> 03:45:44.920
and a

03:45:44.920 --> 03:45:46.920
tier list rating for the first

03:45:46.920 --> 03:45:48.920
membership stream week

03:45:48.920 --> 03:45:50.920
we're going to spend an awful long time

03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:52.920
on that tier list rating so i do apologize

03:45:52.920 --> 03:45:54.920
it's going to be a bit of an epic

03:45:54.920 --> 03:45:56.920
bit of an epic

03:45:56.920 --> 03:45:58.920
mmm

03:45:58.920 --> 03:46:00.920
thank you

03:46:00.920 --> 03:46:02.920
oh how's the toe

03:46:02.920 --> 03:46:04.920
i

03:46:04.920 --> 03:46:06.920
i might be

03:46:06.920 --> 03:46:08.920
losing my toenail

03:46:10.920 --> 03:46:12.920
so

03:46:12.920 --> 03:46:14.920
i went to the doctor

03:46:14.920 --> 03:46:16.920
managed to go to the doctor all good

03:46:16.920 --> 03:46:18.920
and

03:46:18.920 --> 03:46:20.920
they've given me

03:46:20.920 --> 03:46:22.920
an option

03:46:22.920 --> 03:46:24.920
they've given me an option

03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:26.920
i can either remove a side of my toenail

03:46:26.920 --> 03:46:28.920
or i can get the whole

03:46:28.920 --> 03:46:30.920
thing taken off

03:46:30.920 --> 03:46:32.920
and they told

03:46:32.920 --> 03:46:34.920
me that

03:46:34.920 --> 03:46:36.920
if i get

03:46:36.920 --> 03:46:38.920
the side of it taken off

03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:40.920
because of the shape

03:46:40.920 --> 03:46:42.920
of my nails i have what's known as

03:46:42.920 --> 03:46:44.920
C shape nails i have no idea

03:46:44.920 --> 03:46:46.920
if anyone listening knows what that means

03:46:46.920 --> 03:46:48.920
i have C shape nails

03:46:48.920 --> 03:46:50.920
which means i

03:46:50.920 --> 03:46:52.920
am more prone to this

03:46:52.920 --> 03:46:54.920
issue

03:46:54.920 --> 03:46:56.920
so they basically said

03:46:56.920 --> 03:46:58.920
ingrown toenail that's what they said

03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:00.920
i thought she cut into my skin

03:47:00.920 --> 03:47:02.920
but she cut into my skin

03:47:02.920 --> 03:47:04.920
and down the side of my nail

03:47:04.920 --> 03:47:06.920
which is why it was so messed up

03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:08.920
so

03:47:08.920 --> 03:47:10.920
i have an option

03:47:10.920 --> 03:47:12.920
to either get it cut on the side

03:47:12.920 --> 03:47:14.920
a little bit or get the whole thing taken

03:47:14.920 --> 03:47:16.920
off

03:47:16.920 --> 03:47:18.920
and i've opted to get the whole thing taken

03:47:18.920 --> 03:47:20.920
off because i can't be arsed

03:47:20.920 --> 03:47:22.920
hahaha

03:47:22.920 --> 03:47:24.920
i would just still love me

03:47:24.920 --> 03:47:26.920
if i didn't have 10 toenails

03:47:26.920 --> 03:47:28.920
they said

03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:30.920
it doesn't grow back

03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:32.920
for some reason your fingernails grow back

03:47:32.920 --> 03:47:34.920
but your toes don't

03:47:34.920 --> 03:47:36.920
so yeah

03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:38.920
they said the risk

03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:40.920
because of my nail shape

03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:42.920
the risk of me having this problem

03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:44.920
occurring is pretty high

03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:46.920
but i thought i had normal toes

03:47:46.920 --> 03:47:48.920
but apparently i have unique C shaped

03:47:48.920 --> 03:47:50.920
toes wherever that means

03:47:50.920 --> 03:47:52.920
yeah you still love me

03:47:52.920 --> 03:47:54.920
yeah for some reason

03:47:54.920 --> 03:47:56.920
if you lose your fingernail

03:47:56.920 --> 03:47:58.920
it will grow back

03:47:58.920 --> 03:48:00.920
your toenails do not have this ability

03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:02.920
today i have learned

03:48:02.920 --> 03:48:04.920
so i have opted

03:48:04.920 --> 03:48:06.920
just to get it yanked off

03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:08.920
it's coming up in a few days

03:48:08.920 --> 03:48:10.920
i think

03:48:10.920 --> 03:48:12.920
after my buckshot roulette

03:48:12.920 --> 03:48:14.920
i am perfectly fine to stream

03:48:14.920 --> 03:48:16.920
i asked i was like

03:48:16.920 --> 03:48:18.920
my toes built different

03:48:18.920 --> 03:48:20.920
i said is this going to put me

03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:22.920
at a disadvantage

03:48:22.920 --> 03:48:24.920
will i be able to

03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:26.920
i need to be in bed rest

03:48:26.920 --> 03:48:28.920
and they said as long as

03:48:28.920 --> 03:48:30.920
it feels fine

03:48:30.920 --> 03:48:32.920
i feel well

03:48:32.920 --> 03:48:34.920
i am okay to set up

03:48:34.920 --> 03:48:36.920
i am completely okay

03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:38.920
to set up and stream

03:48:38.920 --> 03:48:40.920
because i still want to stream smile

03:48:40.920 --> 03:48:42.920
hahaha

03:48:42.920 --> 03:48:44.920
because

03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:46.920
if i needed bed rest

03:48:46.920 --> 03:48:48.920
but i don't need bed rest for it

03:48:48.920 --> 03:48:50.920
which is good for me

03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:52.920
just means we can paint your toenails faster

03:48:52.920 --> 03:48:54.920
honestly

03:48:54.920 --> 03:48:56.920
should i show what it looks like

03:48:56.920 --> 03:48:58.920
once it's healed up

03:48:58.920 --> 03:49:00.920
they told me the healing takes a long time

03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:02.920
so i am going to be taking

03:49:02.920 --> 03:49:04.920
vitamins

03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:06.920
i also have been advised

03:49:06.920 --> 03:49:08.920
i need to go sit out in the sun for 5 minutes

03:49:08.920 --> 03:49:10.920
to get my vitamin D up

03:49:10.920 --> 03:49:12.920
if you didn't know your vitamin D

03:49:12.920 --> 03:49:14.920
your scars heal faster

03:49:14.920 --> 03:49:16.920
if winds heal fast

03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:18.920
not a scar sorry if a wind doesn't heal fast

03:49:18.920 --> 03:49:20.920
it becomes a scar

03:49:20.920 --> 03:49:22.920
but i looked up some pictures

03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:24.920
of what toes look like

03:49:24.920 --> 03:49:26.920
that don't have a toenail

03:49:26.920 --> 03:49:28.920
it doesn't look that gross to me

03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:30.920
it just looks unique

03:49:30.920 --> 03:49:32.920
and

03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:34.920
oh no the feet lovers

03:49:34.920 --> 03:49:36.920
are in shambles with me

03:49:36.920 --> 03:49:38.920
i am so sorry if you are a foot lover

03:49:38.920 --> 03:49:40.920
i recommend imibizo she is doing a foot cam stream this week

03:49:40.920 --> 03:49:42.920
i am afraid i can no longer

03:49:42.920 --> 03:49:44.920
take over

03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:46.920
yeah

03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:48.920
so

03:49:48.920 --> 03:49:50.920
it's probably never going to get a pedicure again

03:49:50.920 --> 03:49:52.920
i am sure that surprises no one

03:49:52.920 --> 03:49:54.920
the funny thing was

03:49:54.920 --> 03:49:56.920
i had looked up

03:49:56.920 --> 03:49:58.920
stories about going and getting

03:49:58.920 --> 03:50:00.920
pedicures done

03:50:00.920 --> 03:50:02.920
and i was like that sounds so silly

03:50:02.920 --> 03:50:04.920
that's never going to happen to me

03:50:04.920 --> 03:50:06.920
the one time i go

03:50:06.920 --> 03:50:08.920
and get my freaking toes done

03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:12.920
but i am not mad honestly i find it

03:50:12.920 --> 03:50:14.920
quite funny like some

03:50:14.920 --> 03:50:16.920
people might be like oh my god how are you laughing at this

03:50:16.920 --> 03:50:18.920
i don't know it's just funny

03:50:18.920 --> 03:50:20.920
like i feel like your body

03:50:20.920 --> 03:50:22.920
tells stories

03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:24.920
and like my story

03:50:24.920 --> 03:50:26.920
is like oh i got a pedicure done

03:50:26.920 --> 03:50:28.920
for my reef lens and now i have

03:50:28.920 --> 03:50:30.920
night and toenail

03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:32.920
like i think that's a funny story

03:50:32.920 --> 03:50:34.920
like i think that's serious like your body

03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:36.920
is telling all these stories

03:50:36.920 --> 03:50:38.920
of all the fun you had in your life

03:50:38.920 --> 03:50:40.920
and i have a scar

03:50:40.920 --> 03:50:42.920
on my boob

03:50:42.920 --> 03:50:44.920
because

03:50:44.920 --> 03:50:46.920
i handled a feral kitten

03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:48.920
don't recommend ever picking up

03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:50.920
a feral kitten but unfortunately it's an emergency situation

03:50:50.920 --> 03:50:52.920
so i have a big scar

03:50:52.920 --> 03:50:54.920
a little

03:50:54.920 --> 03:50:56.920
well it's not big sorry it's a light white scar that goes

03:50:56.920 --> 03:50:58.920
along my chest

03:50:58.920 --> 03:51:00.920
and i just think these kind of things

03:51:00.920 --> 03:51:02.920
are like little funny things

03:51:02.920 --> 03:51:04.920
being like oh i remember when that happened

03:51:04.920 --> 03:51:06.920
i burnt myself on my mum's

03:51:06.920 --> 03:51:08.920
lamp

03:51:08.920 --> 03:51:10.920
she had like a nightstand lamp shade thing

03:51:10.920 --> 03:51:12.920
and i burnt myself on it and i've got a burn

03:51:12.920 --> 03:51:14.920
on the back of my elbow

03:51:14.920 --> 03:51:16.920
i think these are like funny kind of things

03:51:16.920 --> 03:51:18.920
some people might be embarrassed about scars

03:51:18.920 --> 03:51:20.920
or things going on with their body

03:51:20.920 --> 03:51:22.920
but i'm like that's me

03:51:22.920 --> 03:51:24.920
that's what makes me me

03:51:24.920 --> 03:51:26.920
yeah i've got like a scar

03:51:26.920 --> 03:51:28.920
on my knuckle

03:51:28.920 --> 03:51:30.920
because i rode my bike

03:51:30.920 --> 03:51:32.920
into an event

03:51:32.920 --> 03:51:34.920
at my grand's house

03:51:34.920 --> 03:51:36.920
it's just how i'm made up

03:51:36.920 --> 03:51:38.920
it's just part of me

03:51:38.920 --> 03:51:40.920
as a little child

03:51:40.920 --> 03:51:42.920
sorry i just kicked the mic sorry i'm lifting

03:51:42.920 --> 03:51:44.920
my feet up hold on

03:51:44.920 --> 03:51:46.920
you put my feet up yeah

03:51:46.920 --> 03:51:48.920
i don't think anyone should be embarrassed

03:51:48.920 --> 03:51:50.920
um

03:51:50.920 --> 03:51:52.920
about scars or your body

03:51:52.920 --> 03:51:54.920
it's you it's what makes you a silly goober

03:51:56.920 --> 03:51:58.920
you know

03:51:58.920 --> 03:52:00.920
so my father was a gamer

03:52:00.920 --> 03:52:02.920
hmm

03:52:02.920 --> 03:52:04.920

03:52:04.920 --> 03:52:06.920

you guys are gonna see my hands so much

03:52:12.920 --> 03:52:14.920

i'm gonna make so much hand cam ASMR

03:52:16.920 --> 03:52:18.920
um

03:52:18.920 --> 03:52:20.920
you got a scar on my right pinky

03:52:20.920 --> 03:52:22.920
no clear right front

03:52:22.920 --> 03:52:24.920
we're like tindly saying brian

03:52:26.920 --> 03:52:28.920
ah

03:52:30.920 --> 03:52:32.920
honestly though i think that's like a pretty cool story

03:52:32.920 --> 03:52:34.920
oh wait i did that way

03:52:34.920 --> 03:52:36.920
to prematurely pardon me

03:52:36.920 --> 03:52:38.920
thank you so much for the

03:52:38.920 --> 03:52:40.920
the tip reluctant to say yes

03:52:40.920 --> 03:52:42.920
i have it right now

03:52:42.920 --> 03:52:44.920
i did tell you guys i am on painkillers

03:52:44.920 --> 03:52:46.920
unfortunately it is

03:52:46.920 --> 03:52:48.920
it's throbbing and not the good kind of

03:52:48.920 --> 03:52:50.920
throbbing

03:52:50.920 --> 03:52:52.920
i got it assessed

03:52:52.920 --> 03:52:54.920
and booked me in

03:52:54.920 --> 03:52:56.920
but like the doctor was super lovely

03:52:56.920 --> 03:52:58.920
he was so nice

03:52:58.920 --> 03:53:00.920
i have not had him as a doctor

03:53:00.920 --> 03:53:02.920
because i normally have a chick doctor

03:53:02.920 --> 03:53:04.920
and she's really nice

03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:06.920
but like all the doctors in australia

03:53:06.920 --> 03:53:08.920
shout out to the health care in australia

03:53:08.920 --> 03:53:10.920
you guys are like actually nice

03:53:10.920 --> 03:53:12.920
what the heck

03:53:12.920 --> 03:53:14.920
you guys actually want to help people with their problems

03:53:14.920 --> 03:53:16.920
what the heck

03:53:16.920 --> 03:53:18.920
so yeah ripped to my ill fable

03:53:18.920 --> 03:53:20.920
but i'll keep you guys updated

03:53:20.920 --> 03:53:22.920
it's after the buckshot roulette stream

03:53:22.920 --> 03:53:24.920
so after buckshot roulette

03:53:24.920 --> 03:53:26.920
originally i was gonna do a foot cam

03:53:26.920 --> 03:53:28.920
i'm gonna be honest i think i'm probably gonna be on an ice pack

03:53:28.920 --> 03:53:30.920
by the time we're on buckshot roulette

03:53:30.920 --> 03:53:32.920
i think we'll do heart cam

03:53:32.920 --> 03:53:34.920
no we will not do heart cam

03:53:34.920 --> 03:53:36.920
that's just my chest

03:53:36.920 --> 03:53:38.920
we will do heart beat

03:53:38.920 --> 03:53:40.920
i think azura has a heart beat monitor on

03:53:40.920 --> 03:53:42.920
i was watching her play stardew

03:53:42.920 --> 03:53:44.920
and i'm like what's 86

03:53:44.920 --> 03:53:46.920
what's 82 what's 76

03:53:46.920 --> 03:53:48.920
what's 81

03:53:48.920 --> 03:53:50.920
oh my god it's her heart beat

03:53:50.920 --> 03:53:52.920
she has a heart rate monitor on

03:53:52.920 --> 03:53:54.920
i was like what

03:53:54.920 --> 03:53:56.920
heart surgery cam honestly

03:53:56.920 --> 03:53:58.920
the toe not growing back

03:53:58.920 --> 03:54:00.920
could be different per person

03:54:00.920 --> 03:54:02.920
woah your toe came back

03:54:02.920 --> 03:54:04.920
aww they told me what they need to do

03:54:04.920 --> 03:54:06.920
is like they completely

03:54:06.920 --> 03:54:08.920
i'm not looking forward to it though

03:54:08.920 --> 03:54:10.920
cause they said they have to do like 2 injections

03:54:10.920 --> 03:54:12.920
and then yank your freaking nail out

03:54:12.920 --> 03:54:14.920
which is kinda gross but hey ho

03:54:14.920 --> 03:54:16.920
recovery

03:54:16.920 --> 03:54:18.920
i think they said roughly 2 weeks so

03:54:18.920 --> 03:54:20.920
if you guys really want to see it

03:54:20.920 --> 03:54:22.920
i'll show you but

03:54:22.920 --> 03:54:24.920
kinda gross

03:54:24.920 --> 03:54:26.920
are you squiddling me right now

03:54:26.920 --> 03:54:28.920
anonymous

03:54:28.920 --> 03:54:30.920
maybe a new pedicure will fix the old one

03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:32.920
is that not how it works

03:54:32.920 --> 03:54:34.920
no anonymous sadly

03:54:34.920 --> 03:54:36.920
the reason why

03:54:36.920 --> 03:54:38.920
i had a plaster over my toe

03:54:38.920 --> 03:54:40.920
is because

03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:42.920
when they give you a pedicure

03:54:42.920 --> 03:54:44.920
they cut around the skin and they cut your nail super short

03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:46.920
because they're gonna apply

03:54:46.920 --> 03:54:48.920
gel to it

03:54:48.920 --> 03:54:50.920
and the girl

03:54:50.920 --> 03:54:52.920
accidentally cut into the

03:54:52.920 --> 03:54:54.920
side of my skin

03:54:54.920 --> 03:54:56.920
and then cut into the nail

03:54:56.920 --> 03:54:58.920
itself

03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:00.920
which is why it's causing all these

03:55:00.920 --> 03:55:02.920
problems and basically acting

03:55:02.920 --> 03:55:04.920
infected

03:55:04.920 --> 03:55:06.920
cause it's now growing into

03:55:06.920 --> 03:55:08.920
my skin which sounds really gross

03:55:08.920 --> 03:55:10.920
said it like that

03:55:10.920 --> 03:55:12.920
but unfortunately

03:55:12.920 --> 03:55:14.920
not happening

03:55:14.920 --> 03:55:16.920
my poor elf able

03:55:16.920 --> 03:55:18.920
did they say

03:55:18.920 --> 03:55:20.920
anything about putting a chemical on it

03:55:20.920 --> 03:55:22.920
to prevent

03:55:22.920 --> 03:55:24.920
i think so i can't remember the full

03:55:24.920 --> 03:55:26.920
conversation basically

03:55:26.920 --> 03:55:28.920
the conversation was like

03:55:28.920 --> 03:55:30.920
you've got this

03:55:30.920 --> 03:55:32.920
what do you want to do this is what happens

03:55:32.920 --> 03:55:34.920
if you cut the side of it it's a possibility

03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:36.920
of coming back and cause of your nail shape

03:55:36.920 --> 03:55:38.920
it's much more likely to happen again

03:55:38.920 --> 03:55:40.920
or if you just get it off it's one and done

03:55:40.920 --> 03:55:42.920
you don't have to come back

03:55:42.920 --> 03:55:44.920
everything should be fine

03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:46.920
i don't need antibiotics

03:55:46.920 --> 03:55:48.920
it's not like that

03:55:48.920 --> 03:55:50.920
it's just bad

03:55:50.920 --> 03:55:52.920
so i

03:55:52.920 --> 03:55:54.920
i'm just like get it over and done with

03:55:54.920 --> 03:55:56.920
i want to be in and out i want to be back streaming

03:55:56.920 --> 03:55:58.920
i don't want to have to like go back in

03:55:58.920 --> 03:56:00.920
and all that

03:56:00.920 --> 03:56:02.920
nah just take the whole thing off take off

03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:04.920
we gotta go bald take it off we gotta go bald

03:56:08.920 --> 03:56:10.920
thankfully because

03:56:10.920 --> 03:56:12.920
i get to sit while i stream

03:56:12.920 --> 03:56:14.920
as opposed to someone who's forced

03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:16.920
to stand while they stream

03:56:16.920 --> 03:56:18.920
question mark anyway

03:56:18.920 --> 03:56:20.920
the healing

03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:22.920
process isn't an issue

03:56:22.920 --> 03:56:24.920
cause i explained i was like

03:56:24.920 --> 03:56:26.920
i'm stronger

03:56:26.920 --> 03:56:28.920
i don't have to be bed ridden for this

03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:30.920
and he was like nah you're fine

03:56:30.920 --> 03:56:32.920
if you're sitting for the full day then just sit

03:56:32.920 --> 03:56:34.920
i need to change the bandages

03:56:34.920 --> 03:56:36.920
though which i'm a bit

03:56:36.920 --> 03:56:38.920
i don't know if it's gonna be gross

03:56:38.920 --> 03:56:40.920
but i'll try my best to behave

03:56:42.920 --> 03:56:44.920
uh

03:56:44.920 --> 03:56:46.920
don't worry even if it doesn't grow back i don't care

03:56:46.920 --> 03:56:48.920
yeah he's still like my

03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:50.920
nine toenails

03:56:50.920 --> 03:56:52.920
bandage changing

03:56:52.920 --> 03:56:54.920
oh you're feeling brave

03:56:54.920 --> 03:56:56.920
i think it's going to be

03:56:56.920 --> 03:56:58.920
very

03:56:58.920 --> 03:57:00.920
not pleasant

03:57:02.920 --> 03:57:04.920
you'll have to wrap the top when you take a shower

03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:06.920
i could probably take a bath easier

03:57:06.920 --> 03:57:08.920
than a shower cause i can just like dive into the water

03:57:08.920 --> 03:57:10.920
with my leg out of the bath

03:57:10.920 --> 03:57:12.920
mummy streaming from the hospital bed

03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:14.920
i probably would

03:57:14.920 --> 03:57:16.920
i'm not even joking

03:57:16.920 --> 03:57:18.920
i'd probably

03:57:18.920 --> 03:57:20.920
if i was ever in a hospital for a long time

03:57:20.920 --> 03:57:22.920
cause of whatever reason

03:57:22.920 --> 03:57:24.920
i'd probably just buy a gaming laptop

03:57:24.920 --> 03:57:26.920
import my model on it and be like right

03:57:26.920 --> 03:57:28.920
that's it let's go

03:57:28.920 --> 03:57:30.920
and then like the nurses come in

03:57:30.920 --> 03:57:32.920
and they're like what are you doing

03:57:32.920 --> 03:57:34.920
and i'm like oh don't worry about it

03:57:34.920 --> 03:57:36.920
need me to chat

03:57:36.920 --> 03:57:38.920
hospitals that's who would go hard

03:57:38.920 --> 03:57:40.920
why

03:57:42.920 --> 03:57:44.920
well we're almost at 7000

03:57:44.920 --> 03:57:46.920
fishies

03:57:46.920 --> 03:57:48.920
god we are getting through it

03:57:48.920 --> 03:57:50.920
the question is are we going to finish the fishies

03:57:50.920 --> 03:57:52.920
by the endurance

03:57:52.920 --> 03:57:54.920
well you keep streaming from the shows how you

03:57:54.920 --> 03:57:56.920
raise the nurses for real for real

03:57:56.920 --> 03:57:58.920
why is it nurses are

03:57:58.920 --> 03:58:00.920
so caked up for like no reason

03:58:00.920 --> 03:58:02.920
i have a

03:58:02.920 --> 03:58:04.920
i said i'm becoming a nurse only to

03:58:04.920 --> 03:58:06.920
get an even larger rump

03:58:08.920 --> 03:58:10.920
so i can get a larger rump

03:58:10.920 --> 03:58:12.920
my friend

03:58:12.920 --> 03:58:14.920
had his removed forever ago it doesn't look that different

03:58:14.920 --> 03:58:16.920
just an indent where the nail was

03:58:16.920 --> 03:58:18.920
okay so true nurses

03:58:18.920 --> 03:58:20.920
have that cake

03:58:20.920 --> 03:58:22.920
you can play old school rinscape on your phone

03:58:22.920 --> 03:58:24.920
but i kinda stream it though

03:58:24.920 --> 03:58:26.920
oh it's the bunny reefling

03:58:26.920 --> 03:58:28.920
that i thought was telling me to hurt

03:58:28.920 --> 03:58:30.920
myself because they gave me

03:58:30.920 --> 03:58:32.920
fish food and poison

03:58:32.920 --> 03:58:34.920
the 1002 smelly

03:58:34.920 --> 03:58:36.920
socks in your bank

03:58:36.920 --> 03:58:38.920
that's reeflings giving me a big

03:58:38.920 --> 03:58:40.920
beauty

03:58:40.920 --> 03:58:42.920
let's just say

03:58:42.920 --> 03:58:44.920
there was no ink left

03:58:44.920 --> 03:58:46.920
in the intent

03:58:48.920 --> 03:58:50.920
strong it's your body your decision but

03:58:50.920 --> 03:58:52.920
are you feeling you might regret it i couldn't

03:58:52.920 --> 03:58:54.920
give less about

03:58:54.920 --> 03:58:56.920
my toes i'm gonna be honest

03:58:56.920 --> 03:58:58.920
i

03:58:58.920 --> 03:59:00.920
don't

03:59:00.920 --> 03:59:02.920
they don't do anything for me

03:59:02.920 --> 03:59:04.920
i don't paint them

03:59:04.920 --> 03:59:06.920
i'm not very feminine in terms

03:59:06.920 --> 03:59:08.920
of getting my nails and toes done

03:59:08.920 --> 03:59:10.920
it doesn't

03:59:10.920 --> 03:59:12.920
affect me they told me it doesn't

03:59:12.920 --> 03:59:14.920
affect my balance in any way

03:59:14.920 --> 03:59:16.920
my feet will adjust very quickly

03:59:16.920 --> 03:59:18.920
to applying pressure

03:59:18.920 --> 03:59:20.920
while walking

03:59:20.920 --> 03:59:22.920
i'm not trying to dismiss your thing

03:59:22.920 --> 03:59:24.920
but the fun part is

03:59:24.920 --> 03:59:26.920
if you put the meshy stick thing on the bed

03:59:26.920 --> 03:59:28.920
if it comes off

03:59:28.920 --> 03:59:30.920

03:59:32.920 --> 03:59:34.920
yeah

03:59:34.920 --> 03:59:36.920
it doesn't bother me i've never been

03:59:36.920 --> 03:59:38.920
into doing my nails or anything

03:59:38.920 --> 03:59:40.920

and make us obey when soon

04:01:58.920 --> 04:02:00.920
my first hypnosis

is forget your name

04:02:02.920 --> 04:02:04.920

04:02:04.920 --> 04:02:06.920
you will respond to reefling you will get praises reefling etc

04:02:06.920 --> 04:02:08.920
it will not have

04:02:08.920 --> 04:02:10.920
permanent effects it will be

04:02:10.920 --> 04:02:12.920
roughly 30 minutes long

04:02:12.920 --> 04:02:14.920
but it will fade away

04:02:14.920 --> 04:02:16.920
after two hours i'm going to do a two hour

04:02:16.920 --> 04:02:18.920
fade effect

04:02:18.920 --> 04:02:20.920
i am very cautious about doing any permanent

04:02:20.920 --> 04:02:22.920
effects stuff it makes me

04:02:22.920 --> 04:02:24.920
slightly nervous

04:02:24.920 --> 04:02:26.920
very nervous

04:02:26.920 --> 04:02:28.920
strony what if

04:02:28.920 --> 04:02:30.920
our name is already reefling

04:02:30.920 --> 04:02:32.920
you already respond if i have loved you into reefling

04:02:32.920 --> 04:02:34.920
reefling

04:02:34.920 --> 04:02:36.920
who's been a naughty reefling

04:02:36.920 --> 04:02:38.920
hmm

04:02:38.920 --> 04:02:40.920
have you not been looking after yourself

04:02:40.920 --> 04:02:42.920
reefling

04:02:42.920 --> 04:02:44.920
how are we supposed to look after each other

04:02:44.920 --> 04:02:46.920
if you don't

04:02:46.920 --> 04:02:48.920
look after yourself

04:02:48.920 --> 04:02:50.920
hmm

04:02:50.920 --> 04:02:52.920
hmm

04:02:52.920 --> 04:02:54.920
that's right i'm going to guilt trip you into looking

04:02:54.920 --> 04:02:56.920
after yourself and there's nothing you can do

04:02:56.920 --> 04:02:58.920
about it

04:02:58.920 --> 04:03:00.920
it's over for you reefling

04:03:00.920 --> 04:03:02.920
it's over before it even started

04:03:02.920 --> 04:03:04.920
okay this is too real

04:03:04.920 --> 04:03:06.920
but i've already been permanently affected

04:03:06.920 --> 04:03:08.920
by you momae

04:03:10.920 --> 04:03:12.920
i stood at attention

04:03:12.920 --> 04:03:14.920
i turned up

04:03:14.920 --> 04:03:16.920
reefling

04:03:16.920 --> 04:03:18.920
time to line up it's time for your daily

04:03:18.920 --> 04:03:20.920
inking

04:03:20.920 --> 04:03:22.920
what hole are you going to get it's a surprise

04:03:24.920 --> 04:03:26.920
that's terrible

04:03:26.920 --> 04:03:28.920
why do i say these things out loud

04:03:28.920 --> 04:03:30.920
also me when

04:03:30.920 --> 04:03:32.920
my content gets limited

04:03:32.920 --> 04:03:34.920
i had some curious i wonder why

04:03:34.920 --> 04:03:36.920
hmm

04:03:36.920 --> 04:03:38.920
thanks on you

04:03:38.920 --> 04:03:40.920
my name's already been reefling for a week

04:03:40.920 --> 04:03:42.920
oh wait it has

04:03:42.920 --> 04:03:44.920
literally because you're cold reefling

04:03:44.920 --> 04:03:46.920
i like surprises

04:03:46.920 --> 04:03:48.920
sounds like a bit

04:03:48.920 --> 04:03:50.920
the game is right from the start

04:03:50.920 --> 04:03:52.920
it's inking time not yet

04:03:54.920 --> 04:03:56.920
not yet

04:03:56.920 --> 04:03:58.920
because we like it

04:03:58.920 --> 04:04:00.920
the algorithm must be haunted

04:04:00.920 --> 04:04:02.920
hmm

04:04:02.920 --> 04:04:04.920
actually i need to

04:04:04.920 --> 04:04:06.920
tell the girls to be careful

04:04:06.920 --> 04:04:08.920
and say more substitute words

04:04:08.920 --> 04:04:10.920
so if you didn't know

04:04:10.920 --> 04:04:12.920
youtube auto caption streams

04:04:12.920 --> 04:04:14.920
doesn't even matter for the full 12 hours

04:04:14.920 --> 04:04:16.920
youtube auto caption it

04:04:16.920 --> 04:04:18.920
and the problem with that is

04:04:18.920 --> 04:04:20.920
that's why you need to do

04:04:20.920 --> 04:04:22.920
substitute words because it will identify

04:04:22.920 --> 04:04:24.920
the rate of things being said

04:04:24.920 --> 04:04:26.920
and it'll be so you can swear sometimes

04:04:26.920 --> 04:04:28.920
but if you swear too much

04:04:28.920 --> 04:04:30.920
you're in trouble you know what i mean

04:04:30.920 --> 04:04:32.920
so

04:04:32.920 --> 04:04:34.920
i'll need to tell the girls to maybe do

04:04:34.920 --> 04:04:36.920
some

04:04:36.920 --> 04:04:38.920
i just hear a really weird noise there

04:04:38.920 --> 04:04:40.920
is that in game

04:04:40.920 --> 04:04:42.920
hmm

04:04:42.920 --> 04:04:44.920
are you squidding me right now

04:04:44.920 --> 04:04:46.920

04:05:06.920 --> 04:05:08.920
the slang

04:05:08.920 --> 04:05:10.920
are you being saying like

04:05:10.920 --> 04:05:12.920
are you being saying like oh i

04:05:12.920 --> 04:05:14.920
instead of like yes

04:05:14.920 --> 04:05:16.920
you're like mmm i can do that

04:05:16.920 --> 04:05:18.920

04:05:24.920 --> 04:05:26.920

you didn't tell us you were Scottish

04:05:28.920 --> 04:05:30.920

04:05:38.920 --> 04:05:40.920
oh emi's

04:05:40.920 --> 04:05:42.920
vaude is totally not going to be kept up

04:05:42.920 --> 04:05:44.920
even after editing out

04:05:44.920 --> 04:05:46.920
she's already on a warning

04:05:46.920 --> 04:05:48.920
so i'm very worried about as you're in emi

04:05:48.920 --> 04:05:50.920
at this stage

04:05:50.920 --> 04:05:52.920
i don't want to tell the girls like hey you need to like knock

04:05:52.920 --> 04:05:54.920
it off because that's not fun for anyone

04:05:54.920 --> 04:05:56.920
sorry my microphone is

04:05:56.920 --> 04:05:58.920
just playing a prank on me

04:05:58.920 --> 04:06:00.920
they're pranking me john the Scottish accent

04:06:00.920 --> 04:06:02.920
it's funny until it's too late

04:06:04.920 --> 04:06:06.920
to be honest i've started typing

04:06:06.920 --> 04:06:08.920
i a lot more

04:06:08.920 --> 04:06:10.920
hmmm

04:06:10.920 --> 04:06:12.920
how do warnings work

04:06:12.920 --> 04:06:14.920
so none of the girls have a strike

04:06:14.920 --> 04:06:16.920
on their youtube channel

04:06:16.920 --> 04:06:18.920
but they have a warning

04:06:18.920 --> 04:06:20.920
that lasts 90 days

04:06:20.920 --> 04:06:22.920
3 months

04:06:22.920 --> 04:06:24.920
so if they were to do something

04:06:24.920 --> 04:06:26.920
against tos they get a full strike

04:06:26.920 --> 04:06:28.920
which limits them

04:06:28.920 --> 04:06:30.920
for a week

04:06:30.920 --> 04:06:32.920
they can't do anything for a week

04:06:32.920 --> 04:06:34.920
they can't upload

04:06:34.920 --> 04:06:36.920
they can't update, they can't do this, they can't do that

04:06:36.920 --> 04:06:38.920
and i am a bit

04:06:38.920 --> 04:06:40.920
nervous

04:06:40.920 --> 04:06:42.920
but as soon as the warning expires

04:06:42.920 --> 04:06:44.920
at the 90 day mark

04:06:44.920 --> 04:06:46.920
i think

04:06:46.920 --> 04:06:48.920
all is good at that but what the heck

04:06:48.920 --> 04:06:50.920
is that

04:06:50.920 --> 04:06:52.920
what the hell

04:06:52.920 --> 04:06:54.920
oh my

04:06:54.920 --> 04:06:56.920
there's no way

04:06:56.920 --> 04:06:58.920
way

04:06:58.920 --> 04:07:00.920
hold on big ass he's right

04:07:02.920 --> 04:07:04.920
it's not

04:07:04.920 --> 04:07:06.920
messed up because

04:07:06.920 --> 04:07:08.920
it gives a warning

04:07:08.920 --> 04:07:10.920
and not a strike

04:07:10.920 --> 04:07:12.920
but the length

04:07:12.920 --> 04:07:14.920
being 90 days is pretty rough

04:07:14.920 --> 04:07:16.920
i have to admit considering

04:07:16.920 --> 04:07:18.920
youtube haven't announced their new

04:07:18.920 --> 04:07:20.920
updated tos or their stealth

04:07:20.920 --> 04:07:22.920
tos wherever you want to call it at this rate

04:07:22.920 --> 04:07:24.920
um

04:07:24.920 --> 04:07:26.920
it's a bit messed up because

04:07:26.920 --> 04:07:28.920
they've updated it but because they gave

04:07:28.920 --> 04:07:30.920
a warning

04:07:30.920 --> 04:07:32.920
if they gave a strike then yes i would agree

04:07:32.920 --> 04:07:34.920
and say that's really not fair

04:07:34.920 --> 04:07:36.920
because you've not

04:07:36.920 --> 04:07:38.920
you've yet to say that ASMR ear licking

04:07:38.920 --> 04:07:40.920
is against the rules yet even though

04:07:40.920 --> 04:07:42.920
you're applying it

04:07:42.920 --> 04:07:44.920
um

04:07:44.920 --> 04:07:46.920
type thing

04:07:46.920 --> 04:07:48.920
but yeah so i have to confess

04:07:48.920 --> 04:07:50.920
i've reached 90 cooking 3 times

04:07:50.920 --> 04:07:52.920
before this stream you cannot have

04:07:52.920 --> 04:07:54.920
i only started like a week ago

04:07:56.920 --> 04:07:58.920
you can't you mean

04:07:58.920 --> 04:08:00.920
before though like before

04:08:00.920 --> 04:08:02.920
you can't have done 99

04:08:02.920 --> 04:08:04.920
because that's like

04:08:04.920 --> 04:08:06.920
they say it tastes like 81

04:08:06.920 --> 04:08:08.920
hours to do 99 or something

04:08:08.920 --> 04:08:10.920
oh azura got a warning

04:08:10.920 --> 04:08:12.920
for eating a cookie unfortunately yes

04:08:12.920 --> 04:08:14.920
like azura

04:08:14.920 --> 04:08:16.920
i don't know what's going on with azura

04:08:16.920 --> 04:08:18.920
she wanted to do

04:08:18.920 --> 04:08:20.920
an exercise ASMR stream

04:08:20.920 --> 04:08:22.920
and unfortunately

04:08:22.920 --> 04:08:24.920
management was like

04:08:24.920 --> 04:08:26.920
bruv you're gonna get a strike for that

04:08:26.920 --> 04:08:28.920
you literally got in trouble

04:08:28.920 --> 04:08:30.920
for eating a cookie

04:08:30.920 --> 04:08:32.920
what makes you think you can do heavy breathing ASMR

04:08:32.920 --> 04:08:34.920
working out

04:08:34.920 --> 04:08:36.920
and it's such a shame because i never want to say

04:08:36.920 --> 04:08:38.920
no to the girls

04:08:38.920 --> 04:08:40.920
but

04:08:40.920 --> 04:08:42.920
i don't want to risk her money like her income

04:08:42.920 --> 04:08:44.920
i know she's not monetized yet but she's about to be

04:08:44.920 --> 04:08:46.920
i do not want to risk her monetization

04:08:46.920 --> 04:08:48.920
and

04:08:48.920 --> 04:08:50.920
like if she wanted to

04:08:50.920 --> 04:08:52.920
record it and upload it

04:08:52.920 --> 04:08:54.920
like on twitter that's fine

04:08:54.920 --> 04:08:56.920
i have no issues with that

04:08:56.920 --> 04:08:58.920
the cookie embargo honestly

04:08:58.920 --> 04:09:00.920
yeah the sounds youtube sucks

04:09:00.920 --> 04:09:02.920
and

04:09:02.920 --> 04:09:04.920
yeah she wanted to do work out ASMR

04:09:04.920 --> 04:09:06.920
but that would result in like heavy breathing

04:09:06.920 --> 04:09:08.920
in the mic and

04:09:08.920 --> 04:09:10.920
i don't know what is going on at youtube

04:09:10.920 --> 04:09:12.920
headquarters but it is

04:09:12.920 --> 04:09:14.920
absolutely

04:09:14.920 --> 04:09:16.920
going to the dogs

04:09:16.920 --> 04:09:18.920
i wish they would just come out and see what is and what isn't

04:09:18.920 --> 04:09:20.920
instead of playing this weird

04:09:20.920 --> 04:09:22.920
guessing game of like oh

04:09:22.920 --> 04:09:24.920
but that's fine oh but that's not

04:09:24.920 --> 04:09:26.920
fine

04:09:32.920 --> 04:09:34.920
oh my god

04:09:34.920 --> 04:09:36.920
but yeah the

04:09:36.920 --> 04:09:38.920
very curious very curious

04:09:38.920 --> 04:09:40.920
well i got a thousand

04:09:40.920 --> 04:09:42.920
likes on that ASMR video hold on

04:09:42.920 --> 04:09:44.920
in the money

04:09:44.920 --> 04:09:46.920
you may not

04:09:46.920 --> 04:09:48.920
have a cookie youtube literally

04:09:48.920 --> 04:09:50.920
i think

04:09:50.920 --> 04:09:52.920
because azura's voice is so

04:09:52.920 --> 04:09:54.920
silky perfection and sex

04:09:54.920 --> 04:09:56.920
who is why she got walloped

04:09:56.920 --> 04:09:58.920
with it which is a shame because it's not fair

04:09:58.920 --> 04:10:00.920
that's not fair at all

04:10:00.920 --> 04:10:02.920
and because that is just her voice

04:10:02.920 --> 04:10:04.920
i i'll tell

04:10:04.920 --> 04:10:06.920
you something in the interview

04:10:06.920 --> 04:10:08.920
with her i thought she was

04:10:08.920 --> 04:10:10.920
putting it on and she was going to like

04:10:10.920 --> 04:10:12.920
reveal her voice to me in the interview

04:10:12.920 --> 04:10:14.920
no that's just her voice she's just

04:10:14.920 --> 04:10:16.920
straight up a goddess

04:10:16.920 --> 04:10:18.920
no questions asked

04:10:18.920 --> 04:10:20.920
hmm

04:10:20.920 --> 04:10:22.920
purple burglar

04:10:22.920 --> 04:10:24.920
you're the second one

04:10:24.920 --> 04:10:26.920
you're the second one i see you

04:10:26.920 --> 04:10:28.920
see you taking it

04:10:28.920 --> 04:10:30.920
um literally

04:10:30.920 --> 04:10:32.920
punished her for her default voice

04:10:32.920 --> 04:10:34.920
i thought literally there was a lot of

04:10:34.920 --> 04:10:36.920
actually there was a really interesting thing about the

04:10:36.920 --> 04:10:38.920
introduce yourself videos

04:10:38.920 --> 04:10:40.920
a lot of people did their

04:10:40.920 --> 04:10:42.920
character voice that they currently

04:10:42.920 --> 04:10:44.920
like do as a vtuber and then they were like

04:10:44.920 --> 04:10:46.920
hi viewer

04:10:46.920 --> 04:10:48.920
in their actual voice

04:10:48.920 --> 04:10:50.920
and it was quite interesting

04:10:50.920 --> 04:10:52.920
it was nice seeing the swap

04:10:52.920 --> 04:10:54.920
and i was convinced i was like oh azura is like

04:10:54.920 --> 04:10:56.920
yeah putting on a voice and i did the

04:10:56.920 --> 04:10:58.920
interview and i was like oh

04:10:58.920 --> 04:11:00.920
i didn't even know people had goddess voices

04:11:00.920 --> 04:11:02.920
like this um

04:11:02.920 --> 04:11:04.920
do you know how much money i would make with your voice

04:11:04.920 --> 04:11:06.920
yes thank you give it to me now

04:11:06.920 --> 04:11:08.920
i literally i was like if i could grab

04:11:08.920 --> 04:11:10.920
all the girls voices

04:11:10.920 --> 04:11:12.920
you guys seen

04:11:12.920 --> 04:11:14.920
that movie with a mermaid in it

04:11:14.920 --> 04:11:16.920
where her voice gets stolen

04:11:16.920 --> 04:11:18.920
oh it's called the little mermaid yeah

04:11:18.920 --> 04:11:20.920
her voice gets stolen she's like

04:11:22.920 --> 04:11:24.920
me she did 40 push ups

04:11:24.920 --> 04:11:26.920
yesterday and the noise is

04:11:30.920 --> 04:11:32.920
your voice is

04:11:32.920 --> 04:11:34.920
okay you like that right

04:11:34.920 --> 04:11:36.920
lads time for a group session

04:11:36.920 --> 04:11:38.920
get your tentacle out

04:11:38.920 --> 04:11:40.920
and then get your lotion

04:11:40.920 --> 04:11:42.920
and have a wee go at your tentacle

04:11:42.920 --> 04:11:44.920
and then once you're ready you'll ink

04:11:44.920 --> 04:11:46.920
everywhere thank you lads

04:11:46.920 --> 04:11:48.920
that's literally how i thought

04:11:48.920 --> 04:11:50.920
my demo recording went

04:11:50.920 --> 04:11:52.920
it was absolutely awful

04:11:52.920 --> 04:11:54.920
who's stunting on us with these lava

04:11:54.920 --> 04:11:56.920
capes

04:11:58.920 --> 04:12:00.920
vivi pronouncing it below

04:12:00.920 --> 04:12:02.920
still sends me

04:12:02.920 --> 04:12:04.920
it's adorable

04:12:08.920 --> 04:12:10.920
i literally if i could steal the girls

04:12:10.920 --> 04:12:12.920
voices it would be over for everyone

04:12:12.920 --> 04:12:14.920
unanimously at once

04:12:14.920 --> 04:12:16.920
i could do lollipop i could do

04:12:16.920 --> 04:12:18.920
milk i could do me

04:12:18.920 --> 04:12:20.920
i could do yandere

04:12:20.920 --> 04:12:22.920
you know but i can't

04:12:24.920 --> 04:12:26.920
but that's okay

04:12:26.920 --> 04:12:28.920
because sometimes i can go

04:12:28.920 --> 04:12:30.920
but the only way i can do this

04:12:30.920 --> 04:12:32.920
is by closing my mouth basically

04:12:36.920 --> 04:12:38.920
would you still watch me if i was a lollipop

04:12:38.920 --> 04:12:40.920
beecher burn sounded like that

04:12:40.920 --> 04:12:42.920
don't you want to watch me

04:12:42.920 --> 04:12:44.920

04:12:46.920 --> 04:12:48.920
yeah

04:12:48.920 --> 04:12:50.920
drop

04:12:50.920 --> 04:12:52.920
more like your mom

04:12:52.920 --> 04:12:54.920
dropped her on your head as a baby

04:12:54.920 --> 04:12:56.920
your family this dude

04:12:56.920 --> 04:12:58.920
can't get rid of me

04:12:58.920 --> 04:13:00.920
yeah

04:13:00.920 --> 04:13:02.920
today on our risk game

04:13:02.920 --> 04:13:04.920
we're gonna

04:13:04.920 --> 04:13:06.920
get the swordfish

04:13:06.920 --> 04:13:08.920
that we're burning

04:13:08.920 --> 04:13:10.920
i don't even want to

04:13:10.920 --> 04:13:12.920
with the burn rate of eating

04:13:12.920 --> 04:13:14.920
it's not working

04:13:14.920 --> 04:13:16.920
i think i'm down here comfortably

04:13:16.920 --> 04:13:18.920
and i'll stay down here

04:13:18.920 --> 04:13:20.920
only if you had the same personality

04:13:20.920 --> 04:13:22.920
i cannot lighten my scottish accent

04:13:22.920 --> 04:13:24.920
to do

04:13:24.920 --> 04:13:26.920
lollipop scots

04:13:26.920 --> 04:13:28.920
it's impossible

04:13:30.920 --> 04:13:32.920
oh here we go

04:13:32.920 --> 04:13:34.920
oh here we go

04:13:34.920 --> 04:13:36.920
no the accent gets

04:13:36.920 --> 04:13:38.920
oh here we go

04:13:38.920 --> 04:13:40.920
i can't do lollipop scots with a head

04:13:44.920 --> 04:13:46.920
are we going your bike

04:13:46.920 --> 04:13:48.920
are we going your bike

04:13:48.920 --> 04:13:50.920
it doesn't work

i overthink stuff a lot

04:15:50.920 --> 04:15:52.920
i'm overthinking it as always

04:15:52.920 --> 04:15:54.920
i overthink stuff a lot

04:15:54.920 --> 04:15:56.920
it's not working

04:15:56.920 --> 04:15:58.920
i'm not mimicking

04:15:58.920 --> 04:16:00.920
it's not working

04:16:00.920 --> 04:16:02.920
that was a terrible attempt

04:16:02.920 --> 04:16:04.920
at least i tried

04:16:04.920 --> 04:16:06.920
i sounded a lot better during the asmr

04:16:06.920 --> 04:16:08.920
i think that went a lot better

04:16:08.920 --> 04:16:10.920
agent smith

04:16:10.920 --> 04:16:12.920
no

04:16:12.920 --> 04:16:14.920
you should totally go take

04:16:14.920 --> 04:16:16.920
a break and let us get

04:16:16.920 --> 04:16:18.920

04:16:18.920 --> 04:16:20.920

04:16:24.920 --> 04:16:26.920
i need my tea

04:16:28.920 --> 04:16:30.920
if you could mimic the wheezing laugh

04:16:30.920 --> 04:16:32.920
that would be impressive

04:16:32.920 --> 04:16:34.920
does following someone stop me

04:16:34.920 --> 04:16:36.920
from being kicked from afk

04:16:36.920 --> 04:16:38.920
i have no idea

04:16:38.920 --> 04:16:40.920
i'm sorry

04:16:40.920 --> 04:16:42.920
she really is all six girls

04:16:42.920 --> 04:16:44.920
i think i did mersey's laugh

04:16:44.920 --> 04:16:46.920
pretty all right during the asmr stream

04:16:48.920 --> 04:16:50.920
right when am i taking a break

04:16:50.920 --> 04:16:52.920
when we get 69

04:16:52.920 --> 04:16:54.920
yeah look we're almost there

04:16:54.920 --> 04:16:56.920
literally what a couple more inventories

04:16:56.920 --> 04:16:58.920
i need to wash some dishes for a bit

04:16:58.920 --> 04:17:00.920
oh you're such a good wheezing

04:17:00.920 --> 04:17:02.920
you're looking after the home for me

04:17:02.920 --> 04:17:04.920
thanks for

04:17:04.920 --> 04:17:06.920
washing the dishes

04:17:06.920 --> 04:17:08.920
do not attempt to mimic

04:17:08.920 --> 04:17:10.920
mersey's laugh

04:17:10.920 --> 04:17:12.920
if someone can send me a sample of it

04:17:12.920 --> 04:17:14.920
like a time stamp

04:17:16.920 --> 04:17:18.920
i might be able to

04:17:20.920 --> 04:17:22.920
we're almost level 69

04:17:22.920 --> 04:17:24.920
and then i will call we'll do a pee break

04:17:24.920 --> 04:17:26.920
i'm gonna get loads of food and all of that

04:17:26.920 --> 04:17:28.920
i'm gonna make another tea

04:17:28.920 --> 04:17:30.920
sorry my bottle is crinkling away there

04:17:32.920 --> 04:17:34.920
mmmm

04:17:34.920 --> 04:17:36.920

04:17:38.920 --> 04:17:40.920
not voice pyre safe

04:17:40.920 --> 04:17:42.920

04:17:44.920 --> 04:17:46.920

04:17:46.920 --> 04:17:48.920

04:17:48.920 --> 04:17:50.920
if you're on ruin light

04:17:50.920 --> 04:17:52.920
you can look for the logout timer

04:17:56.920 --> 04:17:58.920
like it's funny but i'm afraid

04:17:58.920 --> 04:18:00.920
for her every time it starts

04:18:00.920 --> 04:18:02.920

04:18:02.920 --> 04:18:04.920
nooo

04:18:04.920 --> 04:18:06.920

04:18:10.920 --> 04:18:12.920
my burn rate went up again

04:18:12.920 --> 04:18:14.920

04:18:16.920 --> 04:18:18.920
identity theft

04:18:18.920 --> 04:18:20.920

04:18:36.920 --> 04:18:38.920

04:18:38.920 --> 04:18:40.920
24 hours the recommendation

04:18:40.920 --> 04:18:42.920

i don't want them to be one after another

04:19:36.920 --> 04:19:38.920

you part with your card super easily

04:24:30.920 --> 04:24:32.920
there's no pin on it

04:24:32.920 --> 04:24:34.920
the limits are like 5000 us dollars

04:24:34.920 --> 04:24:36.920
i'm like

04:24:36.920 --> 04:24:38.920

04:24:40.920 --> 04:24:42.920
that's just a default

04:24:46.920 --> 04:24:48.920
please if you're listening right now

04:24:48.920 --> 04:24:50.920

04:24:50.920 --> 04:24:52.920
worldly possessions has a pin on it

04:24:52.920 --> 04:24:54.920
because that is

04:24:54.920 --> 04:24:56.920
insanity i was like so

04:24:56.920 --> 04:24:58.920
flabbergasted and ironically

04:24:58.920 --> 04:25:00.920

04:25:00.920 --> 04:25:02.920

so i was like why are you handing me your card

04:25:06.920 --> 04:25:08.920
um

04:25:08.920 --> 04:25:10.920

04:25:10.920 --> 04:25:12.920
one american family that came

04:25:12.920 --> 04:25:14.920

04:25:14.920 --> 04:25:16.920

04:25:16.920 --> 04:25:18.920

04:25:18.920 --> 04:25:20.920
him we couldn't understand each

04:25:20.920 --> 04:25:22.920

04:25:22.920 --> 04:25:24.920
he wanted water

04:25:24.920 --> 04:25:26.920

american infrastructure you have to

04:28:46.920 --> 04:28:48.920
put a down payment to get a car type thing

04:28:48.920 --> 04:28:50.920
and debt you can buy

things online in four installments

04:28:52.920 --> 04:28:54.920
that's a debt

04:28:56.920 --> 04:28:58.920
offender of all

04:28:58.920 --> 04:29:00.920
mortgages

04:29:00.920 --> 04:29:02.920
mortgages are just

04:29:02.920 --> 04:29:04.920
normalized debt

04:29:04.920 --> 04:29:06.920
for normalized

04:29:06.920 --> 04:29:08.920
debt enslavement

04:29:08.920 --> 04:29:10.920
there is no way you can guarantee

04:29:10.920 --> 04:29:12.920
you're gonna have a perfect income

04:29:12.920 --> 04:29:14.920
for 30 years

04:29:14.920 --> 04:29:16.920
and then ah

04:29:16.920 --> 04:29:18.920
ah i could absolutely

04:29:18.920 --> 04:29:20.920
explode off the planet

04:29:22.920 --> 04:29:24.920
they also close your account

04:29:24.920 --> 04:29:26.920
if you don't use your card anyway

04:29:26.920 --> 04:29:28.920
sorry what are mortgages

04:29:28.920 --> 04:29:30.920
so a mortgage is when you go to a bank

04:29:30.920 --> 04:29:32.920
and you say hello bank i would like to purchase

04:29:32.920 --> 04:29:34.920
this house the bank will then

04:29:34.920 --> 04:29:36.920
own your house

04:29:36.920 --> 04:29:38.920
that you pay a monthly mortgage

04:29:38.920 --> 04:29:40.920
into with astronomical

04:29:40.920 --> 04:29:42.920
fees over the years

04:29:42.920 --> 04:29:44.920
with the charged interest

04:29:44.920 --> 04:29:46.920
by the time you have finished

04:29:54.920 --> 04:29:56.920
amount that isn't even houses

04:30:02.920 --> 04:30:04.920
construction isn't even at that value

the entire system

04:30:06.920 --> 04:30:08.920

04:30:30.920 --> 04:30:32.920
about any of these aspects

04:30:32.920 --> 04:30:34.920
you the system

04:30:34.920 --> 04:30:36.920
is rigged against you

04:30:36.920 --> 04:30:38.920
do not feel a shred

04:30:38.920 --> 04:30:40.920
of it multi-generational

04:30:40.920 --> 04:30:42.920
living was incredibly

04:30:42.920 --> 04:30:44.920
common for

04:30:44.920 --> 04:30:46.920
centuries

04:30:46.920 --> 04:30:48.920
way before capitalism came

04:30:48.920 --> 04:30:50.920
into the picture do not be

04:30:50.920 --> 04:30:52.920
embarrassed about living with your

04:30:52.920 --> 04:30:54.920
more living with your grand

04:30:54.920 --> 04:30:56.920
that is your sense of community

04:30:56.920 --> 04:30:58.920
is beautiful to even have that

04:30:58.920 --> 04:31:00.920
and I would absolutely love

04:31:00.920 --> 04:31:02.920
to see the uprising

04:31:02.920 --> 04:31:04.920
of multi-generational households

04:31:04.920 --> 04:31:06.920
I would absolutely love to

04:31:06.920 --> 04:31:08.920
see the uprising of

04:31:08.920 --> 04:31:10.920
people going back to farming

04:31:10.920 --> 04:31:12.920
another thing in

04:31:12.920 --> 04:31:14.920
World War I and World War II

04:31:16.920 --> 04:31:18.920
people on mass

04:31:18.920 --> 04:31:20.920
were instructed

04:31:20.920 --> 04:31:22.920
on how to grow vegetables

04:31:22.920 --> 04:31:24.920
at home with the rise

04:31:24.920 --> 04:31:26.920
of supermarkets capitalism

04:31:26.920 --> 04:31:28.920
who here

04:31:28.920 --> 04:31:30.920
knows someone who grows

04:31:30.920 --> 04:31:32.920
produce themselves

04:31:32.920 --> 04:31:34.920
I know no one

04:31:34.920 --> 04:31:36.920
I know no one

04:31:36.920 --> 04:31:38.920
that grows produce themselves

04:31:38.920 --> 04:31:40.920
because of how

04:31:40.920 --> 04:31:42.920
how much lack of time

04:31:42.920 --> 04:31:44.920
people have maybe

04:31:44.920 --> 04:31:46.920
your grand may do it

04:31:46.920 --> 04:31:48.920
because she has time because she is retired

04:31:48.920 --> 04:31:50.920
did you know how common it was

04:31:50.920 --> 04:31:52.920
to have a farm

04:31:52.920 --> 04:31:54.920
to have farm animals

04:31:54.920 --> 04:31:56.920
such as chickens how common it was

04:31:56.920 --> 04:31:58.920
to grow even the most

04:31:58.920 --> 04:32:00.920
basic of vegetable such as

04:32:00.920 --> 04:32:02.920
potatoes such as tomatoes

04:32:02.920 --> 04:32:04.920
such as peas

04:32:04.920 --> 04:32:06.920
okay

04:32:06.920 --> 04:32:08.920
you?

04:32:08.920 --> 04:32:10.920
I want to see this

04:32:10.920 --> 04:32:12.920
become a thing

04:32:12.920 --> 04:32:14.920
another thing

04:32:14.920 --> 04:32:16.920
notice how tiny gardens

04:32:16.920 --> 04:32:18.920
are getting for houses

04:32:18.920 --> 04:32:20.920

why are all PNG's

04:32:38.920 --> 04:32:40.920

04:32:40.920 --> 04:32:42.920

04:32:54.920 --> 04:32:56.920
hold on a minute

04:32:56.920 --> 04:32:58.920

right and while I'm at it

04:33:16.920 --> 04:33:18.920
sorry I just jumped up there in excitement

04:33:18.920 --> 04:33:20.920
and while I'm at it

04:33:20.920 --> 04:33:22.920
hmm

04:33:22.920 --> 04:33:24.920
isn't it curious that garden

04:33:24.920 --> 04:33:26.920
spaces for the average house

04:33:26.920 --> 04:33:28.920
have been lessening and lessening

04:33:28.920 --> 04:33:30.920
every year I wonder

04:33:30.920 --> 04:33:32.920
do they want the people

04:33:32.920 --> 04:33:34.920
not to have the ability to grow

04:33:34.920 --> 04:33:36.920
produce in the means of their

04:33:36.920 --> 04:33:38.920
own production for survival

04:33:38.920 --> 04:33:40.920
hmmm

04:33:40.920 --> 04:33:42.920
isn't that curious

04:33:42.920 --> 04:33:44.920
isn't that curious that flats

04:33:44.920 --> 04:33:46.920
massive sky scraping building blocks

04:33:46.920 --> 04:33:48.920
have no garden space

04:33:48.920 --> 04:33:50.920
so people cannot produce their own

04:33:50.920 --> 04:33:52.920
produce their own vegetables

04:33:52.920 --> 04:33:54.920
their own fruits their own herbs

04:33:54.920 --> 04:33:56.920
so people are forced to

04:33:56.920 --> 04:33:58.920
rely on supermarkets

04:33:58.920 --> 04:34:00.920
yet again

04:34:00.920 --> 04:34:02.920
capitalism strikes

04:34:02.920 --> 04:34:04.920
isn't that curious

04:34:04.920 --> 04:34:06.920
I find that so curious

04:34:06.920 --> 04:34:08.920
at this day and age

04:34:08.920 --> 04:34:10.920
with all these

04:34:10.920 --> 04:34:12.920
advancements on building so many houses

04:34:12.920 --> 04:34:14.920
the garden spaces are getting so tiny

04:34:14.920 --> 04:34:16.920
you cannot even have a produce

04:34:16.920 --> 04:34:18.920
producing tree and isn't it curious

04:34:18.920 --> 04:34:20.920
that even when there are

04:34:20.920 --> 04:34:22.920
fruit producing trees

04:34:22.920 --> 04:34:24.920
that

04:34:24.920 --> 04:34:26.920
they purposely don't have

04:34:26.920 --> 04:34:28.920
fruit producing trees when they have to put trees down

04:34:28.920 --> 04:34:30.920
instead they use pollen trees

04:34:30.920 --> 04:34:32.920
which are good

04:34:32.920 --> 04:34:34.920
I don't get me wrong they're good for the bugs

04:34:34.920 --> 04:34:36.920
but they never give free

04:34:36.920 --> 04:34:38.920
produce producing trees

04:34:38.920 --> 04:34:40.920
I fucking saw a story where someone

04:34:40.920 --> 04:34:42.920
got given lemons from

04:34:42.920 --> 04:34:44.920
the garden and she didn't know that you could

04:34:44.920 --> 04:34:46.920
just straight up cut the lemon open

04:34:46.920 --> 04:34:48.920
and add it to the juice they thought it had to be

04:34:48.920 --> 04:34:50.920
produce isn't it interesting

04:34:50.920 --> 04:34:52.920
that in school you hardly

04:34:52.920 --> 04:34:54.920
learn about the cycle of the farmers

04:34:54.920 --> 04:34:56.920
and how you never are encouraged

04:34:56.920 --> 04:34:58.920
to go to farmers markets

04:34:58.920 --> 04:35:00.920
instead of the big fricking Tescos

04:35:00.920 --> 04:35:02.920
or big as their big this or big that

04:35:02.920 --> 04:35:04.920
talk your shit

04:35:04.920 --> 04:35:06.920
damn straight I'll talk my shit

04:35:06.920 --> 04:35:08.920
isn't that interesting

04:35:08.920 --> 04:35:10.920
that you hardly even learn about seeds

04:35:10.920 --> 04:35:12.920
seeds I will tell you

04:35:12.920 --> 04:35:14.920
about seeds right now

04:35:14.920 --> 04:35:16.920
to remember the three threat factors

04:35:16.920 --> 04:35:18.920
of growing seeds it's what

04:35:18.920 --> 04:35:20.920
W-O-T

04:35:20.920 --> 04:35:22.920
water, oxygen, temperature

04:35:22.920 --> 04:35:24.920
that is how you grow seeds

04:35:26.920 --> 04:35:28.920
the other part of the fun is when

04:35:28.920 --> 04:35:30.920
Monsanto tries to sue people for using their seeds

04:35:30.920 --> 04:35:32.920
and another thing

04:35:32.920 --> 04:35:34.920
there's states where you can't even collect

04:35:34.920 --> 04:35:36.920
rainwater it is illegal to collect

04:35:36.920 --> 04:35:38.920
rainwater what would you use

04:35:38.920 --> 04:35:40.920
for rainwater hmm

04:35:40.920 --> 04:35:42.920
you would water your own crops

04:35:42.920 --> 04:35:44.920
with rainwater

04:35:44.920 --> 04:35:46.920
bruv this

04:35:46.920 --> 04:35:48.920
system is

04:35:48.920 --> 04:35:50.920
fuck

04:35:50.920 --> 04:35:52.920
it's beyond bull

04:35:54.920 --> 04:35:56.920
don't look too deep into it

04:35:56.920 --> 04:35:58.920
or you're not going to enjoy what you see

04:35:58.920 --> 04:36:00.920
you have to look around

04:36:00.920 --> 04:36:02.920
and say we live in a society

04:36:02.920 --> 04:36:04.920
that's all we can do

04:36:04.920 --> 04:36:06.920
Reeflings

04:36:06.920 --> 04:36:08.920
we live in a society

04:36:08.920 --> 04:36:10.920
amen

04:36:10.920 --> 04:36:12.920
okay I'm going to get off my soap box

04:36:12.920 --> 04:36:14.920
for a minute there

04:36:14.920 --> 04:36:16.920
let me remove this asset

04:36:16.920 --> 04:36:18.920
let me remove my tin foil hat

04:36:18.920 --> 04:36:20.920
but don't think I won't put that hat back on

04:36:20.920 --> 04:36:22.920
hold on actually

04:36:22.920 --> 04:36:24.920
I have this hat

04:36:24.920 --> 04:36:26.920
okay

04:36:26.920 --> 04:36:28.920
we can put this hat on we're back to meman

04:36:30.920 --> 04:36:32.920
okay it's a bit wonky but

04:36:32.920 --> 04:36:34.920
it's really wonky

04:36:34.920 --> 04:36:36.920
right above calm down we live

04:36:36.920 --> 04:36:38.920
in a society

04:36:38.920 --> 04:36:40.920
ooh

04:36:40.920 --> 04:36:42.920
thank you for letting me rant about that

04:36:42.920 --> 04:36:44.920
but it makes you think

04:36:44.920 --> 04:36:46.920
it's illegal to collect rainwater

04:36:46.920 --> 04:36:48.920
yes

04:36:48.920 --> 04:36:50.920
but is that because

04:36:50.920 --> 04:36:52.920
it might drinking water might be contaminated

04:36:52.920 --> 04:36:54.920
why do you think that's contaminated

04:36:54.920 --> 04:36:56.920
is it because these mega

04:36:56.920 --> 04:36:58.920
corporations bribe

04:36:58.920 --> 04:37:00.920
their way

04:37:00.920 --> 04:37:02.920
into being allowed to pollute the waters

04:37:02.920 --> 04:37:04.920
did you know in the UK

04:37:04.920 --> 04:37:06.920
there is no

04:37:06.920 --> 04:37:08.920
swimmable rivers

04:37:08.920 --> 04:37:10.920
that are not toxic

04:37:10.920 --> 04:37:12.920
for they are all actively

04:37:12.920 --> 04:37:14.920
being polluted in

04:37:14.920 --> 04:37:16.920
hmm did you know that

04:37:16.920 --> 04:37:18.920
all in the name of what

04:37:18.920 --> 04:37:20.920
reeflings

04:37:20.920 --> 04:37:22.920
capitalism

04:37:22.920 --> 04:37:24.920
shocking behavior

04:37:24.920 --> 04:37:26.920
sorry I took my tin foil hat off

04:37:26.920 --> 04:37:28.920
zero

04:37:28.920 --> 04:37:30.920
yes zero

04:37:32.920 --> 04:37:34.920
by the way I also have a friend who has like

04:37:34.920 --> 04:37:36.920
20 different crops growing in his basement

04:37:36.920 --> 04:37:38.920
so a garden is technically not needed

04:37:38.920 --> 04:37:40.920
and that

04:37:40.920 --> 04:37:42.920
should that gentleman be having those crops

04:37:42.920 --> 04:37:44.920
right

04:37:44.920 --> 04:37:46.920
I'll get, ooh pardon me

04:37:46.920 --> 04:37:48.920
I'll get off my high horse

04:37:48.920 --> 04:37:50.920
I think I may need to eat for I haven't eaten anything at all to do

04:37:50.920 --> 04:37:52.920
in fact I've only had a cup of tea

04:37:52.920 --> 04:37:54.920
and a half bottle of water

04:37:54.920 --> 04:37:56.920
it's not looking good for me

04:37:56.920 --> 04:37:58.920
so yes

04:37:58.920 --> 04:38:00.920
I will do

04:38:00.920 --> 04:38:02.920
another batch

04:38:02.920 --> 04:38:04.920
so when strongies farm

04:38:04.920 --> 04:38:06.920
airing on BBC

04:38:06.920 --> 04:38:08.920
oh they'd never let me air it I'd be going nuts

04:38:08.920 --> 04:38:10.920
yeah actually

04:38:10.920 --> 04:38:12.920
we'll go back for it a little bit it's not too tin foil hat

04:38:12.920 --> 04:38:14.920
during world war one and world war two

04:38:14.920 --> 04:38:16.920
where food scarcity was a thing

04:38:16.920 --> 04:38:18.920
in the modern day age food scarcity

04:38:18.920 --> 04:38:20.920
is not a thing please do not be under the impression

04:38:20.920 --> 04:38:22.920
scarcity is a lie

04:38:22.920 --> 04:38:24.920
food

04:38:24.920 --> 04:38:26.920
scarcity was a thing

04:38:26.920 --> 04:38:28.920
so people were encouraged to grow

04:38:28.920 --> 04:38:30.920
farms to do very unique

04:38:30.920 --> 04:38:32.920
plots to do

04:38:32.920 --> 04:38:34.920
legumes to do potatoes to do

04:38:34.920 --> 04:38:36.920
the most staple foods you can imagine

04:38:36.920 --> 04:38:38.920
and with the uprising

04:38:38.920 --> 04:38:40.920
of supermarkets people stopped doing it

04:38:40.920 --> 04:38:42.920
and who benefits

04:38:42.920 --> 04:38:44.920
who benefits

04:38:44.920 --> 04:38:46.920
when we

04:38:46.920 --> 04:38:48.920
the individuals the small

04:38:48.920 --> 04:38:50.920
communities no longer grow

04:38:50.920 --> 04:38:52.920
our own crops no longer

04:38:52.920 --> 04:38:54.920
have thingy

04:38:54.920 --> 04:38:56.920
we are fully reliant

04:38:56.920 --> 04:38:58.920
on the system

04:38:58.920 --> 04:39:00.920
which is not good

04:39:00.920 --> 04:39:02.920
you never want to fully rely on the system

04:39:02.920 --> 04:39:04.920
but guess what if you don't want to

04:39:04.920 --> 04:39:06.920
rely on the system what do you need

04:39:06.920 --> 04:39:08.920
oh well you need a plot of land to grow

04:39:08.920 --> 04:39:10.920
okay and you need time

04:39:10.920 --> 04:39:12.920
but wait a minute even if I

04:39:12.920 --> 04:39:14.920
fully outright buy my

04:39:14.920 --> 04:39:16.920
plot of land wait a minute

04:39:16.920 --> 04:39:18.920
I still have to play some

04:39:18.920 --> 04:39:20.920
to pay some sort of yearly

04:39:20.920 --> 04:39:22.920
land tax

04:39:22.920 --> 04:39:24.920
towards

04:39:24.920 --> 04:39:26.920
the place that I'm living in

04:39:26.920 --> 04:39:28.920
because there is no place that is truly free

04:39:28.920 --> 04:39:30.920
you can you buy

04:39:30.920 --> 04:39:32.920
a house in UK and every year

04:39:32.920 --> 04:39:34.920
you pay council tax

04:39:34.920 --> 04:39:36.920
even if you don't participate in the services

04:39:36.920 --> 04:39:38.920
that they provide

04:39:38.920 --> 04:39:40.920
you do it in Australia they have a thing

04:39:40.920 --> 04:39:42.920
called land tax in America

04:39:42.920 --> 04:39:44.920
they have a thing called something tax

04:39:44.920 --> 04:39:46.920
even when you

04:39:46.920 --> 04:39:48.920
want to fully

04:39:48.920 --> 04:39:50.920
no longer be a part of the system

04:39:50.920 --> 04:39:52.920
they already got you

04:39:52.920 --> 04:39:54.920
hook, line and sinker

04:39:54.920 --> 04:39:56.920
and it doesn't matter what you do

04:39:56.920 --> 04:39:58.920
you can't escape it anyway that's me

04:39:58.920 --> 04:40:00.920
property ownership tax yet

04:40:00.920 --> 04:40:02.920
farmers are struggling

04:40:02.920 --> 04:40:04.920
yep so

04:40:04.920 --> 04:40:06.920
em

04:40:06.920 --> 04:40:08.920
every time

04:40:08.920 --> 04:40:10.920
there is a shortage

04:40:12.920 --> 04:40:14.920
in Australia recently

04:40:14.920 --> 04:40:16.920
this happened a couple of months back now though

04:40:16.920 --> 04:40:18.920
there was a shortages of eggs

04:40:18.920 --> 04:40:20.920
and the prices went up

04:40:20.920 --> 04:40:22.920
because there was a shortage of course that makes sense

04:40:22.920 --> 04:40:24.920
so more people are wanting eggs

04:40:24.920 --> 04:40:26.920
but there's less eggs ah hold on a minute

04:40:26.920 --> 04:40:28.920
what's going on here we're in the information age

04:40:28.920 --> 04:40:30.920
a major

04:40:30.920 --> 04:40:32.920
em

04:40:32.920 --> 04:40:34.920
a major

04:40:34.920 --> 04:40:36.920
major egg producer

04:40:36.920 --> 04:40:38.920
in Australia came out and said

04:40:38.920 --> 04:40:40.920
em actually

04:40:40.920 --> 04:40:42.920
there's nothing wrong with production at all

04:40:42.920 --> 04:40:44.920
if you want to know the truth

04:40:44.920 --> 04:40:46.920
they're actually not giving us

04:40:46.920 --> 04:40:48.920
as much money as they used to

04:40:48.920 --> 04:40:50.920
yet the prices are going up

04:40:50.920 --> 04:40:52.920
and we don't get to see any of that benefit

04:40:52.920 --> 04:40:54.920
are you telling me

04:40:54.920 --> 04:40:56.920
these mega corporations

04:40:56.920 --> 04:40:58.920
are artificially

04:40:58.920 --> 04:41:00.920
hold on

04:41:00.920 --> 04:41:02.920
are you telling me

04:41:02.920 --> 04:41:04.920
these mega corporations

04:41:04.920 --> 04:41:06.920
wait how is there two

04:41:06.920 --> 04:41:08.920
how did I do that hold on a minute

04:41:08.920 --> 04:41:10.920
I need to put my tinfoil hat back on

04:41:10.920 --> 04:41:12.920
no

04:41:12.920 --> 04:41:14.920
it can't be

04:41:14.920 --> 04:41:16.920
that all these mega corporations

04:41:16.920 --> 04:41:18.920
are actually hand in hand with one another

04:41:18.920 --> 04:41:20.920
no

04:41:20.920 --> 04:41:22.920
wait

04:41:22.920 --> 04:41:24.920
the cost of living crisis

04:41:24.920 --> 04:41:26.920
is actually artificial

04:41:26.920 --> 04:41:28.920
because if one shop

04:41:28.920 --> 04:41:30.920
raises their prices

04:41:30.920 --> 04:41:32.920
the other shop can justify that

04:41:32.920 --> 04:41:34.920
but then the major

04:41:34.920 --> 04:41:36.920
no that can't be right because

04:41:36.920 --> 04:41:38.920
capitalism obviously

04:41:38.920 --> 04:41:40.920
what the frick is that

04:41:40.920 --> 04:41:42.920
that's very grand sitting on that table

04:41:42.920 --> 04:41:44.920
but then oh no that can't be right

04:41:44.920 --> 04:41:46.920
no

04:41:46.920 --> 04:41:48.920
the good businesses aren't

04:41:48.920 --> 04:41:50.920
wait a minute

04:41:50.920 --> 04:41:52.920
Coca Cola owns

04:41:52.920 --> 04:41:54.920
all of the market

04:41:54.920 --> 04:41:56.920
wait

04:41:56.920 --> 04:41:58.920
but I thought capitalism

04:41:58.920 --> 04:42:00.920
bred competition

04:42:00.920 --> 04:42:02.920
no no everything I've been told

04:42:02.920 --> 04:42:04.920
that's not right

04:42:04.920 --> 04:42:06.920
wait a minute

04:42:06.920 --> 04:42:08.920
something's not adding up

04:42:08.920 --> 04:42:10.920
Coca Cola seems to own

04:42:10.920 --> 04:42:12.920
literally everything

04:42:12.920 --> 04:42:14.920
wait a minute who is the sole business owner

04:42:14.920 --> 04:42:16.920
because everything seems

04:42:16.920 --> 04:42:18.920
to be getting acquired

04:42:18.920 --> 04:42:20.920
wait

04:42:20.920 --> 04:42:22.920
wait a minute it's a conglomerate

04:42:22.920 --> 04:42:24.920
everything is a

04:42:24.920 --> 04:42:26.920
fucking conglomerate

04:42:26.920 --> 04:42:28.920
and they can put up the prices as much as they please

04:42:28.920 --> 04:42:30.920
because there's no true

04:42:30.920 --> 04:42:32.920
competition

04:42:32.920 --> 04:42:34.920
even if there were cheaper

04:42:34.920 --> 04:42:36.920
brands that wanted to get on the shelves

04:42:36.920 --> 04:42:38.920
brands have to pay

04:42:38.920 --> 04:42:40.920
to be on the shelves in your common

04:42:40.920 --> 04:42:42.920
supermarkets

04:42:42.920 --> 04:42:44.920
holy moly

04:42:44.920 --> 04:42:46.920
my head

04:42:46.920 --> 04:42:48.920
spinning just thinking about

04:42:48.920 --> 04:42:50.920
how deep this rabbit hole goes

04:42:50.920 --> 04:42:52.920
maybe

04:42:52.920 --> 04:42:54.920
we should focus on the one rabbit hole

04:42:54.920 --> 04:42:56.920
that's important to us

04:42:56.920 --> 04:42:58.920
and that's Sheeby's hole

04:42:58.920 --> 04:43:00.920
we love you Sheeby we hope you feel better

04:43:00.920 --> 04:43:02.920
after your migraine

04:43:02.920 --> 04:43:04.920
what a way to end that

04:43:04.920 --> 04:43:06.920
okay okay I'll take the hat off

04:43:06.920 --> 04:43:08.920
I'll take the hat off

04:43:08.920 --> 04:43:10.920
I'm sorry I get very

04:43:10.920 --> 04:43:12.920
passionate okay

04:43:12.920 --> 04:43:14.920
I get very passionate

04:43:14.920 --> 04:43:16.920
right I'll calm down I'll calm down

04:43:16.920 --> 04:43:18.920
I am going to take

04:43:18.920 --> 04:43:20.920

04:43:20.920 --> 04:43:22.920

if I come back to one message

04:43:28.920 --> 04:43:30.920

04:49:10.920 --> 04:49:12.920
you

04:49:40.920 --> 04:49:42.920
you

04:50:10.920 --> 04:50:12.920
you

04:50:40.920 --> 04:50:42.920
you

04:51:10.920 --> 04:51:12.920
you

04:51:36.920 --> 04:51:38.920
oh my radical

04:51:38.920 --> 04:51:40.920
I mean reeflings

04:51:40.920 --> 04:51:42.920
sorry

04:51:46.920 --> 04:51:48.920
did you tinkle

04:51:48.920 --> 04:51:50.920
did you tinkle let me see you never let me hold it

04:51:50.920 --> 04:51:52.920
you never let me hold it

04:51:52.920 --> 04:51:54.920
I got a whole 3 minutes I was away

04:51:54.920 --> 04:51:56.920
day 100 still in the mummy

04:51:56.920 --> 04:51:58.920
insight

04:51:58.920 --> 04:52:00.920
oh boy

04:52:00.920 --> 04:52:02.920
do you hear it reeflings

04:52:02.920 --> 04:52:04.920
black rock is coming for strongy she knows

04:52:04.920 --> 04:52:06.920
too much and they are coming for you too

04:52:06.920 --> 04:52:08.920
no

04:52:08.920 --> 04:52:10.920
thank you for the tip boy

04:52:10.920 --> 04:52:12.920
um

04:52:12.920 --> 04:52:14.920
no I will

04:52:14.920 --> 04:52:16.920
I think I have got my mesh

04:52:16.920 --> 04:52:18.920
is back

04:52:18.920 --> 04:52:20.920
I will um

04:52:20.920 --> 04:52:22.920
I will refrain from any more tin foil

04:52:22.920 --> 04:52:24.920
and unless you guys get me started again

04:52:24.920 --> 04:52:26.920
then I just can't help myself

04:52:28.920 --> 04:52:30.920
I have a can of cola

04:52:32.920 --> 04:52:34.920
I have a honey tea which I need some help

04:52:34.920 --> 04:52:36.920
the reeflings with

04:52:36.920 --> 04:52:38.920
I have a neutral green bar

04:52:38.920 --> 04:52:40.920
a nature valley crunch bar

04:52:40.920 --> 04:52:42.920
and a blueberry muffin

04:52:42.920 --> 04:52:44.920
I can't really make it make a noise I can smack the bottom

04:52:44.920 --> 04:52:46.920
of the casing

04:52:46.920 --> 04:52:48.920
I don't know if you can hear that

04:52:48.920 --> 04:52:50.920
um

04:52:50.920 --> 04:52:52.920
but that is pretty much

04:52:52.920 --> 04:52:54.920
what's going on

04:52:58.920 --> 04:53:00.920
I really remember

04:53:00.920 --> 04:53:02.920
moving to my head to express

04:53:03.920 --> 04:53:05.920
she came back she loves this

04:53:05.920 --> 04:53:07.920
of course I do

04:53:07.920 --> 04:53:09.920
remember that time I thought I wasn't going to come back

04:53:09.920 --> 04:53:11.920
that was rough

04:53:11.920 --> 04:53:13.920
that was rough and then I come back

04:53:13.920 --> 04:53:15.920
come back even stronger

04:53:15.920 --> 04:53:17.920
yes I

04:53:17.920 --> 04:53:19.920
for endurance streams

04:53:19.920 --> 04:53:21.920
it's not possible

04:53:21.920 --> 04:53:23.920
for me to prepare food

04:53:24.920 --> 04:53:26.920
unless I did it in advance but I am a lazy fud

04:53:26.920 --> 04:53:28.920
um so

04:53:28.920 --> 04:53:30.920
I have bought like a load of

04:53:30.920 --> 04:53:32.920
drive food or food that

04:53:32.920 --> 04:53:34.920
is zero prep time

04:53:34.920 --> 04:53:36.920
I don't have any boiled eggs

04:53:36.920 --> 04:53:38.920
I ate all my boiled eggs

04:53:38.920 --> 04:53:40.920
and my meat sticks have kind of

04:53:40.920 --> 04:53:42.920
overstayed their welcome

04:53:42.920 --> 04:53:44.920
no no no no no no

04:53:44.920 --> 04:53:46.920
I am going to take a bite of my muffin though

04:53:46.920 --> 04:53:48.920
I did not realise

04:53:48.920 --> 04:53:50.920
I had been streaming for five hours

04:53:50.920 --> 04:53:52.920
I literally had nothing but a cup of tea

04:53:52.920 --> 04:53:54.920
and a half bottle of water that's outrageous

04:53:54.920 --> 04:53:56.920
that's how distracted you guys get me

04:53:56.920 --> 04:53:58.920
that's how much I freaking love it

04:53:58.920 --> 04:54:00.920
um

04:54:00.920 --> 04:54:02.920
oh my goodness but yes

04:54:02.920 --> 04:54:04.920
I am going to take a bite of my muffin

04:54:04.920 --> 04:54:06.920
I do apologise if I am not

04:54:06.920 --> 04:54:08.920
talking for a few moments

04:54:08.920 --> 04:54:10.920
but I eat my muffin

04:54:10.920 --> 04:54:12.920
itadakimasu

04:54:16.920 --> 04:54:18.920
oh my goodness

04:54:20.920 --> 04:54:22.920
it's nice and jelly

04:54:22.920 --> 04:54:24.920
oh yeah we distract you

04:54:24.920 --> 04:54:26.920
yeah

04:54:26.920 --> 04:54:28.920
I can't believe it

04:54:28.920 --> 04:54:30.920
I can't believe

04:54:30.920 --> 04:54:32.920
we really enjoy each other's company

04:54:32.920 --> 04:54:34.920
it's crazy it's a crazy concept

04:54:34.920 --> 04:54:36.920
honestly couldn't imagine being a VTuber

04:54:36.920 --> 04:54:38.920
that hates our audience like bro

04:54:40.920 --> 04:54:42.920
why are you even streaming

04:54:42.920 --> 04:54:44.920
cause I am pretty sure I have heard a few

04:54:44.920 --> 04:54:46.920
sent stories like that

04:54:46.920 --> 04:54:48.920
where they are like oh I hate what I do

04:54:48.920 --> 04:54:50.920
I am like what if you hate what you do

04:54:50.920 --> 04:54:52.920
like

04:54:52.920 --> 04:54:54.920
go clock out and do something else

04:54:54.920 --> 04:54:56.920
what the fuck

04:54:56.920 --> 04:54:58.920
how can you not enjoy your time

04:54:58.920 --> 04:55:00.920
actually

04:55:00.920 --> 04:55:02.920
well I am on my high horse about VTubers now

04:55:02.920 --> 04:55:04.920
how can you not enjoy your time

04:55:04.920 --> 04:55:06.920
you dictated everything you get to do

04:55:06.920 --> 04:55:08.920
you don't have to do a single thing

04:55:08.920 --> 04:55:10.920
if you want to play game play game

04:55:10.920 --> 04:55:12.920
if you don't want to play game don't play game

04:55:12.920 --> 04:55:14.920
you want to zazoo zazoo

04:55:14.920 --> 04:55:16.920
you don't want to zazoo don't zazoo

04:55:16.920 --> 04:55:18.920
wait a minute what's going on

04:55:18.920 --> 04:55:20.920
nah I refuse to believe there is any VTubers that stream

04:55:20.920 --> 04:55:22.920
that actually don't like streaming

04:55:22.920 --> 04:55:24.920
they don't like everything

04:55:24.920 --> 04:55:26.920
it doesn't make sense

04:55:26.920 --> 04:55:28.920
the Elden Ring

04:55:28.920 --> 04:55:30.920
DLC comes out

04:55:30.920 --> 04:55:32.920
and I get to do nothing

04:55:32.920 --> 04:55:34.920
but play with you guys

04:55:34.920 --> 04:55:36.920
for again what half a week

04:55:36.920 --> 04:55:38.920
maybe more actually maybe 5 sessions

04:55:38.920 --> 04:55:40.920
I have no idea how big the DLC is

04:55:40.920 --> 04:55:42.920
I don't even know

04:55:42.920 --> 04:55:44.920
if they have given an indication on how big

04:55:44.920 --> 04:55:46.920
the DLC is

04:55:48.920 --> 04:55:50.920
I just want money for existing proof

04:55:50.920 --> 04:55:52.920
and another thing about capital

04:55:52.920 --> 04:55:54.920
I'll stop

04:55:54.920 --> 04:55:56.920
no more hi-hat

04:55:56.920 --> 04:55:58.920
no more tinfoil for now

04:55:58.920 --> 04:56:00.920
I will burn you out on my conspiracy theories

04:56:00.920 --> 04:56:02.920
T-

04:56:02.920 --> 04:56:04.920
1 hour I believe

04:56:04.920 --> 04:56:06.920
for our lovely

04:56:08.920 --> 04:56:10.920
the goddess

04:56:10.920 --> 04:56:12.920
of fertility

04:56:12.920 --> 04:56:14.920
or mummy

04:56:14.920 --> 04:56:16.920
she is your mummy canonically

04:56:16.920 --> 04:56:18.920
she is quite literally your mum

04:56:20.920 --> 04:56:22.920
nah

04:56:22.920 --> 04:56:24.920
it was enough to be nearly a full game

04:56:24.920 --> 04:56:26.920
ok might need to change up my plan

04:56:26.920 --> 04:56:28.920
for the 4th week

04:56:28.920 --> 04:56:30.920
do you want to hold it strongy

04:56:30.920 --> 04:56:32.920
the DLC

04:56:32.920 --> 04:56:34.920
I want to stack donuts on it

04:56:34.920 --> 04:56:36.920
ok if it's like

04:56:36.920 --> 04:56:38.920
wait are we going to do a full week of Elden Ring then

04:56:42.920 --> 04:56:44.920
if we do a full week of Elden Ring

04:56:44.920 --> 04:56:46.920
on the 4th week

04:56:46.920 --> 04:56:48.920
I will make up for any membership

04:56:48.920 --> 04:56:50.920
content like I will literally do

04:56:50.920 --> 04:56:52.920
back to back to back to back to back

04:56:52.920 --> 04:56:54.920
member streams like you know

04:56:54.920 --> 04:56:56.920
I'll do it

04:56:56.920 --> 04:56:58.920
I'll do it to make up

04:56:58.920 --> 04:57:00.920
sure

04:57:00.920 --> 04:57:02.920
thank you for becoming a member

04:57:02.920 --> 04:57:04.920
what do we think

04:57:04.920 --> 04:57:06.920
does that sound to me fine

04:57:06.920 --> 04:57:08.920
stack donuts

04:57:08.920 --> 04:57:10.920
villager minecraft note

04:57:10.920 --> 04:57:12.920
Elden Ring DLC I sleep

04:57:12.920 --> 04:57:14.920
let's see

04:57:14.920 --> 04:57:16.920
hmm

04:57:16.920 --> 04:57:18.920
oh I tell you what

04:57:18.920 --> 04:57:20.920
I was doing my research on a game that I might play

04:57:20.920 --> 04:57:22.920
it's called

04:57:22.920 --> 04:57:24.920
Boutro

04:57:24.920 --> 04:57:26.920
it is a poker

04:57:26.920 --> 04:57:28.920
type game

04:57:28.920 --> 04:57:30.920
and unfortunately

04:57:30.920 --> 04:57:32.920
I'm not very familiar with the old

04:57:32.920 --> 04:57:34.920
straight flush flush royal flush

04:57:34.920 --> 04:57:36.920
or whatever the only flush I do

04:57:36.920 --> 04:57:38.920
is after I drop a big job in the toilet

04:57:38.920 --> 04:57:40.920
and

04:57:40.920 --> 04:57:42.920
I was

04:57:42.920 --> 04:57:44.920
it looks pretty easy to play

04:57:44.920 --> 04:57:46.920
in terms of me actually being good

04:57:46.920 --> 04:57:48.920
that's a different story however

04:57:48.920 --> 04:57:50.920
it looked like a can

04:57:50.920 --> 04:57:52.920
to our game experience

04:57:52.920 --> 04:57:54.920
so I was doing my research

04:57:54.920 --> 04:57:56.920
I was watching people play it and I'm like

04:57:56.920 --> 04:57:58.920
hmm yes I understand none of this

04:57:58.920 --> 04:58:00.920
so I'm going to look at a few more tutorials

04:58:00.920 --> 04:58:02.920
but we might give Boutro a little try

04:58:02.920 --> 04:58:04.920
I'll be one of my shorter streams

04:58:04.920 --> 04:58:06.920
hmm

04:58:06.920 --> 04:58:08.920
not the new tinkle

04:58:08.920 --> 04:58:10.920
the guys whenever you

04:58:10.920 --> 04:58:12.920
poop do you always pee as well

04:58:14.920 --> 04:58:16.920
I think it's the same for guys

04:58:16.920 --> 04:58:18.920
I do know a secret though

04:58:18.920 --> 04:58:20.920
if you move your fireman's

04:58:20.920 --> 04:58:22.920
hose

04:58:22.920 --> 04:58:24.920
your butthole clenches

04:58:24.920 --> 04:58:26.920
I've never been the same

04:58:26.920 --> 04:58:28.920
since I learned that fact on the internet

04:58:28.920 --> 04:58:30.920
the internet has scarred me for that fact

04:58:30.920 --> 04:58:32.920
it's there

04:58:32.920 --> 04:58:34.920
see you're all twitching

04:58:34.920 --> 04:58:36.920
your buttholes right now I can tell

04:58:36.920 --> 04:58:38.920
reeflings

04:58:38.920 --> 04:58:40.920
can't believe you're doing it in unison

04:58:40.920 --> 04:58:42.920
okay

04:58:42.920 --> 04:58:44.920
I have finished

04:58:44.920 --> 04:58:46.920
my mini muffin

04:58:46.920 --> 04:58:48.920
I'm going to open up my cola

04:58:48.920 --> 04:58:50.920
to wash it down

04:58:50.920 --> 04:58:52.920
hmm

04:58:52.920 --> 04:58:54.920
honestly I was worried about eating on stream

04:58:54.920 --> 04:58:56.920
but it's really easy to eat and play runeski

04:58:56.920 --> 04:58:58.920
at the same time

04:58:58.920 --> 04:59:00.920
a twitch butthole for a moment

04:59:00.920 --> 04:59:02.920
reeflings together

04:59:02.920 --> 04:59:04.920
strong

04:59:04.920 --> 04:59:06.920
we can also manually twitch your fireman's hose

04:59:06.920 --> 04:59:08.920
but can you do it without

04:59:08.920 --> 04:59:10.920
twitching the butthole

04:59:10.920 --> 04:59:12.920
no you can't apparently it's guys

04:59:12.920 --> 04:59:14.920
biology that you can't

04:59:22.920 --> 04:59:24.920
wah

04:59:24.920 --> 04:59:26.920
bit cola

04:59:26.920 --> 04:59:28.920
man by the pope

04:59:28.920 --> 04:59:30.920
wait wait wait hold on a minute who's calling me hypocritical

04:59:30.920 --> 04:59:32.920
cause I just talked about corporations

04:59:32.920 --> 04:59:34.920
and then I'm currently eating and drinking cola

04:59:34.920 --> 04:59:36.920
me

04:59:36.920 --> 04:59:38.920
as if I can source this stuff myself in the wild

04:59:40.920 --> 04:59:42.920
who else is going to give me my sugary nectar

04:59:46.920 --> 04:59:48.920
I'm currently open my nature valley

04:59:48.920 --> 04:59:50.920
I have a bowl to eat it in

04:59:50.920 --> 04:59:52.920
because I just know it's going to go

04:59:52.920 --> 04:59:54.920
everywhere

04:59:54.920 --> 04:59:56.920
and

04:59:56.920 --> 04:59:58.920
we're almost at a million eggs

04:59:58.920 --> 05:00:00.920
wah

05:00:02.920 --> 05:00:04.920
look

05:00:04.920 --> 05:00:06.920
7,000

05:00:10.920 --> 05:00:12.920
tea

05:00:12.920 --> 05:00:14.920
did you just snipe that

05:00:14.920 --> 05:00:16.920
I think he just sniped that little thing there

05:00:18.920 --> 05:00:20.920
I'd like to check out mommy's nature valley

05:00:20.920 --> 05:00:22.920
I thought a certain type of

05:00:22.920 --> 05:00:24.920
exercise could give you that kind of

05:00:24.920 --> 05:00:26.920
control over the muscles

05:00:26.920 --> 05:00:28.920
do you guys want to do kegels together

05:00:28.920 --> 05:00:30.920
and hold

05:00:30.920 --> 05:00:32.920
2, 3 and release

05:00:32.920 --> 05:00:34.920
2, 3 and hold 2, 3

05:00:34.920 --> 05:00:36.920
that's terrible

05:00:36.920 --> 05:00:38.920
don't encourage me

05:00:38.920 --> 05:00:40.920
don't get me started

05:00:40.920 --> 05:00:42.920
not only will we have

05:00:42.920 --> 05:00:44.920
oh my god I'm trying to take the nature valley out

05:00:44.920 --> 05:00:46.920
without it crumbling everywhere

05:00:46.920 --> 05:00:48.920
I have a Canadian

05:00:48.920 --> 05:00:50.920
maple syrup flavor

05:00:50.920 --> 05:00:52.920
at nature valley

05:00:52.920 --> 05:00:54.920
I got a box that has like 3 different flavors inside

05:00:54.920 --> 05:00:56.920
and I just grabbed one

05:00:56.920 --> 05:00:58.920
because I had to tinkle and it just

05:00:58.920 --> 05:01:00.920
whoa wait how fast is that spawn

05:01:02.920 --> 05:01:04.920
mmm

05:01:04.920 --> 05:01:06.920
oh god

05:01:12.920 --> 05:01:14.920
I'm sorry if we got my eating time

05:01:18.920 --> 05:01:20.920
I'm off to buy groceries

05:01:20.920 --> 05:01:22.920
enjoy the shop

05:01:22.920 --> 05:01:24.920
try your best to

05:01:24.920 --> 05:01:26.920
shop local

05:01:26.920 --> 05:01:28.920

05:01:28.920 --> 05:01:30.920

05:01:30.920 --> 05:01:32.920
respawn so fast that's 30k

05:01:32.920 --> 05:01:34.920

05:01:34.920 --> 05:01:36.920
wah

05:01:38.920 --> 05:01:40.920
mmm am I going crazy

05:01:40.920 --> 05:01:42.920
why is that spawning so fast

05:01:42.920 --> 05:01:44.920
is it like an event or something

05:01:44.920 --> 05:01:46.920
mommy stir it

05:01:46.920 --> 05:01:48.920
she doesn't need a lips of 22 million

05:01:48.920 --> 05:01:50.920
and I'm like oh my god is that 30k

05:01:50.920 --> 05:01:52.920
that's amazing

05:01:52.920 --> 05:01:54.920
mmm

05:01:54.920 --> 05:01:56.920
yes I'm enjoying

05:01:56.920 --> 05:01:58.920
is Gimli still fine

05:01:58.920 --> 05:02:00.920
no she's asleep

05:02:00.920 --> 05:02:02.920
I have to sneak around her

05:02:02.920 --> 05:02:04.920
mmm

05:02:04.920 --> 05:02:06.920
what was that oh no it wasn't me that leveled up

05:02:06.920 --> 05:02:08.920
I take another big bite

05:02:08.920 --> 05:02:10.920
wah

05:02:10.920 --> 05:02:12.920
wah

05:02:12.920 --> 05:02:14.920
mmm

05:02:14.920 --> 05:02:16.920
bye bye

05:02:16.920 --> 05:02:18.920
don't worry if you have to go

05:02:18.920 --> 05:02:20.920
this is an endurance stream

05:02:20.920 --> 05:02:22.920
I did not expect anyone to sit for 12 hours

05:02:22.920 --> 05:02:24.920
with me on RuneScape alone

05:02:28.920 --> 05:02:30.920
someone's dropping them

05:02:30.920 --> 05:02:32.920
why would they do that

05:02:32.920 --> 05:02:34.920
how rather odd

05:02:38.920 --> 05:02:40.920
is he just giving them away

05:02:42.920 --> 05:02:44.920
but what if we wanted to

05:02:44.920 --> 05:02:46.920
am we not supposed to

05:02:54.920 --> 05:02:56.920
how bizarre

05:03:00.920 --> 05:03:02.920
I think it may be bad for your health

05:03:02.920 --> 05:03:04.920
to watch me for 12 hours

05:03:04.920 --> 05:03:06.920
I'm going to be gone now

05:03:06.920 --> 05:03:08.920
70

05:03:08.920 --> 05:03:10.920
oh my god we hit 70

05:03:10.920 --> 05:03:12.920
we're only

05:03:12.920 --> 05:03:14.920
just over the 5 hour mark

05:03:14.920 --> 05:03:16.920
can we do 80

05:03:16.920 --> 05:03:18.920
is that too much of a reach

05:03:18.920 --> 05:03:20.920
to do 80

05:03:32.920 --> 05:03:34.920

05:03:40.920 --> 05:03:42.920
crumbly

05:03:46.920 --> 05:03:48.920
chat summary shocked you

05:03:48.920 --> 05:03:50.920

I don't even know

05:04:04.920 --> 05:04:06.920
it's too many to choose from

05:04:06.920 --> 05:04:08.920
from 70 to 76

05:04:10.920 --> 05:04:12.920
good 6am

05:04:12.920 --> 05:04:14.920

05:04:24.920 --> 05:04:26.920

05:04:30.920 --> 05:04:32.920

05:04:32.920 --> 05:04:34.920
I was not going to let you post it

05:04:34.920 --> 05:04:36.920
because I'm strumming

05:04:36.920 --> 05:04:38.920
I'm strumming my badge

05:04:48.920 --> 05:04:50.920

05:05:22.920 --> 05:05:24.920
hold on a minute

05:06:04.920 --> 05:06:06.920
but it sounds like a freaking racist name

05:06:08.920 --> 05:06:10.920
sorry that was so off topic

05:06:10.920 --> 05:06:12.920
yeah so there's this pokemon

05:06:12.920 --> 05:06:14.920
called Qing Ling

05:06:14.920 --> 05:06:16.920
and it sounds so racist

05:06:16.920 --> 05:06:18.920
and I'm like bruv

05:06:18.920 --> 05:06:20.920

05:06:26.920 --> 05:06:28.920
but it's a cute pokemon I like the way it looks

05:06:28.920 --> 05:06:30.920

17.9 burn rate

05:06:40.920 --> 05:06:42.920
oh it has gone down

05:06:42.920 --> 05:06:44.920
only tism havers here

05:06:44.920 --> 05:06:46.920
we only have tism around these parts

05:06:46.920 --> 05:06:48.920
we don't have them function in brains

05:06:48.920 --> 05:06:50.920
hmm

05:06:56.920 --> 05:06:58.920
Qing Ling is the sound it makes

05:07:04.920 --> 05:07:06.920
a weird name

05:07:06.920 --> 05:07:08.920

05:07:22.920 --> 05:07:24.920
and he eats iron

05:07:24.920 --> 05:07:26.920

all the swordfishes though

05:07:50.920 --> 05:07:52.920
which is amazing

05:07:52.920 --> 05:07:54.920
I'll need to go buy something

05:07:54.920 --> 05:07:56.920

I remember when pokemon go came out

05:08:14.920 --> 05:08:16.920
I was really digging it

05:08:18.920 --> 05:08:20.920
look at the bunnies dancing

05:08:20.920 --> 05:08:22.920
oh they're doing like a perfect

05:08:22.920 --> 05:08:24.920
you know

05:08:24.920 --> 05:08:26.920
I can't remember what it's called but that's like english culture

05:08:26.920 --> 05:08:28.920
when you stand around a pole and all dance around it

05:08:28.920 --> 05:08:30.920
that sounded like another type of

05:08:30.920 --> 05:08:32.920
dance but no

05:08:32.920 --> 05:08:34.920
it's like actually english culture

05:08:34.920 --> 05:08:36.920
like back in the old days

05:08:36.920 --> 05:08:38.920

05:08:38.920 --> 05:08:40.920

streamer distracted

05:10:22.920 --> 05:10:24.920
I'm so dumb a streamer

05:10:24.920 --> 05:10:26.920
I'm just a streamer

05:10:26.920 --> 05:10:28.920
I stream my life

05:10:28.920 --> 05:10:30.920
away

05:10:30.920 --> 05:10:32.920
away

05:10:34.920 --> 05:10:36.920
I'm just a

05:10:36.920 --> 05:10:38.920
refling

05:10:38.920 --> 05:10:40.920
I stream

05:10:40.920 --> 05:10:42.920
my life away

05:10:42.920 --> 05:10:44.920
away

05:10:46.920 --> 05:10:48.920
68

05:10:48.920 --> 05:10:50.920
16 points oh the burn rate went up

05:10:50.920 --> 05:10:52.920
I got a little too excited hold on a minute

05:10:52.920 --> 05:10:54.920
oh I think it's because it's reset the burn rate will

05:10:54.920 --> 05:10:56.920
kind of go up until

05:10:56.920 --> 05:10:58.920
maybe so you're under arrest

05:10:58.920 --> 05:11:00.920
that guy said the NPC says

05:11:00.920 --> 05:11:02.920
I'm focused on the

05:11:02.920 --> 05:11:04.920
grind you don't want me to grind

05:11:04.920 --> 05:11:06.920
come on mate come on mate

05:11:10.920 --> 05:11:12.920
why would Emmy be under arrest

05:11:12.920 --> 05:11:14.920
it should be pin pals under arrest

05:11:22.920 --> 05:11:24.920
I'm not really enjoying

05:11:24.920 --> 05:11:26.920
this bar anymore

05:11:26.920 --> 05:11:28.920
rather flavorless

05:11:28.920 --> 05:11:30.920
isn't it bro?

05:11:30.920 --> 05:11:32.920
I'm tempted to order

05:11:32.920 --> 05:11:34.920
take away I'm gonna be honest

05:11:34.920 --> 05:11:36.920
I'm like

05:11:36.920 --> 05:11:38.920
I'm doing an endurance stream

05:11:38.920 --> 05:11:40.920
I deserve a cheeky take away

05:11:40.920 --> 05:11:42.920
I'm such a good girl

05:11:44.920 --> 05:11:46.920
pizza nah

05:11:46.920 --> 05:11:48.920
not pizza

05:11:48.920 --> 05:11:50.920
Australian pizza I'm sorry

05:11:50.920 --> 05:11:52.920
Australia and any Australian

05:11:52.920 --> 05:11:54.920
listening

05:11:54.920 --> 05:11:56.920
Australian pizza is no thank you

05:11:56.920 --> 05:11:58.920
I've not had one pizza I've enjoyed here

05:11:58.920 --> 05:12:00.920
I just fill a grease

05:12:00.920 --> 05:12:02.920
and like the grease is like

05:12:02.920 --> 05:12:04.920
dripping off the thing

05:12:04.920 --> 05:12:06.920
they could have like blotted it

05:12:06.920 --> 05:12:08.920
or patted it or whatever but they don't

05:12:10.920 --> 05:12:12.920
a cheeky little treat perhaps

05:12:12.920 --> 05:12:14.920
I'm bringing you all with me

05:12:14.920 --> 05:12:16.920
as I buy a pizza before a storm hits

05:12:16.920 --> 05:12:18.920
oh you're actually getting a pizza in real life

05:12:18.920 --> 05:12:20.920
okay okay

05:12:22.920 --> 05:12:24.920
didn't Emmy burn down buildings

05:12:24.920 --> 05:12:26.920
look Emmy needs

05:12:26.920 --> 05:12:28.920
XP in order to summon her brother

05:12:28.920 --> 05:12:30.920
back it's look whatever she does

05:12:30.920 --> 05:12:32.920
as long as we can look the other way

05:12:32.920 --> 05:12:34.920
the fact she's not actually now that I mentioned

05:12:34.920 --> 05:12:36.920
the fact she's not even in jail

05:12:36.920 --> 05:12:38.920
how would she be evading jail

05:12:38.920 --> 05:12:40.920
when she just used her magic on people

05:12:40.920 --> 05:12:42.920
who'd try and stop her

05:12:42.920 --> 05:12:44.920
or maybe she has like influential magic

05:12:44.920 --> 05:12:46.920
I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised

05:12:46.920 --> 05:12:48.920
if she had like turned the other eye type

05:12:48.920 --> 05:12:50.920
of spells and

05:12:50.920 --> 05:12:52.920
where it was like oh must have been the wind

05:12:52.920 --> 05:12:54.920
and I wouldn't be surprised

05:12:54.920 --> 05:12:56.920
if she had access to that

05:12:56.920 --> 05:12:58.920
and her wee totems

05:13:02.920 --> 05:13:04.920
high charisma, yeah

05:13:06.920 --> 05:13:08.920
she has to rescue Nissan from the devil

05:13:08.920 --> 05:13:10.920
herself

05:13:10.920 --> 05:13:12.920
like Maggie Thatcher

05:13:12.920 --> 05:13:14.920
I think people were so confused

05:13:14.920 --> 05:13:16.920
they were like why the devil herself

05:13:16.920 --> 05:13:18.920
and then Maggie Thatcher and as a surprise

05:13:18.920 --> 05:13:20.920
there was a Scottish person

05:13:20.920 --> 05:13:22.920
on the development team and we thought the gag

05:13:22.920 --> 05:13:24.920
was hilarious so

05:13:24.920 --> 05:13:26.920
there you go

05:13:28.920 --> 05:13:30.920
wow

05:13:30.920 --> 05:13:32.920
I drank a wee bit of cola and then we're gonna get on

05:13:32.920 --> 05:13:34.920
my honey tea

05:13:34.920 --> 05:13:36.920
any honey tears

05:13:38.920 --> 05:13:40.920
I'm honey tea

05:13:42.920 --> 05:13:44.920
and we can just be a

05:13:44.920 --> 05:13:46.920
peeler on them and

05:13:46.920 --> 05:13:48.920
okay they can't do anything

05:13:48.920 --> 05:13:50.920
I cried too

05:13:50.920 --> 05:13:52.920
wait what was my joke

05:13:52.920 --> 05:13:54.920
wait what joke did I just say

05:13:54.920 --> 05:13:56.920
hold on

05:13:56.920 --> 05:13:58.920
wait what did I say that was funny

05:13:58.920 --> 05:14:00.920
go again

05:14:00.920 --> 05:14:02.920
go again tell me, remain me

05:14:02.920 --> 05:14:04.920
I've already forgotten

05:14:06.920 --> 05:14:08.920
oh the Maggie Thatcher

05:14:08.920 --> 05:14:10.920
alright sorry I thought it was a pun

05:14:10.920 --> 05:14:12.920
I'm not gonna lie I had my fingers ready to do that

05:14:14.920 --> 05:14:16.920
my apologies I thought I made a pun

05:14:16.920 --> 05:14:18.920
and I was like what did I make that was funny

05:14:18.920 --> 05:14:20.920
I forgot

05:14:26.920 --> 05:14:28.920
crying fish and chips for my

05:14:34.920 --> 05:14:36.920
so do you want to hear the

05:14:36.920 --> 05:14:38.920
saddest story in all the land

05:14:38.920 --> 05:14:40.920
I really like Mexican food

05:14:40.920 --> 05:14:42.920
you know what I don't like

05:14:42.920 --> 05:14:44.920
cilantro

05:14:44.920 --> 05:14:46.920
and that stuff tastes awful

05:14:46.920 --> 05:14:48.920
do you want to know what

05:14:48.920 --> 05:14:50.920
cilantro

05:14:50.920 --> 05:14:52.920
is primarily used in

05:14:52.920 --> 05:14:54.920
that's right

05:14:54.920 --> 05:14:56.920
Mexican cooking

05:14:56.920 --> 05:14:58.920
man I

05:14:58.920 --> 05:15:00.920
hated here

05:15:00.920 --> 05:15:02.920
it tastes awful to me

05:15:02.920 --> 05:15:04.920
absolutely awful

05:15:04.920 --> 05:15:06.920
I tried a

05:15:06.920 --> 05:15:08.920
I tried a

05:15:08.920 --> 05:15:10.920
rice wrap I think it was

05:15:10.920 --> 05:15:12.920
Vietnamese inspired rice wrap

05:15:12.920 --> 05:15:14.920
no rice cake

05:15:14.920 --> 05:15:16.920
with chicken in it

05:15:16.920 --> 05:15:18.920
and it sounded so good and I took a bite

05:15:18.920 --> 05:15:20.920
and I was like

05:15:22.920 --> 05:15:24.920
in Australia

05:15:24.920 --> 05:15:26.920
there's a lot more

05:15:26.920 --> 05:15:28.920
access to Asian foods

05:15:28.920 --> 05:15:30.920
that are authentic or really good type thing

05:15:30.920 --> 05:15:32.920
which is why I'm currently

05:15:32.920 --> 05:15:34.920
addicted to local Chinese

05:15:38.920 --> 05:15:40.920
I've been adventurous

05:15:40.920 --> 05:15:42.920
I'll try this I'll try that

05:15:42.920 --> 05:15:44.920
and I couldn't figure out why I hated it

05:15:44.920 --> 05:15:46.920
until I finally figured out

05:15:46.920 --> 05:15:48.920
it's cilantro I can't handle

05:15:48.920 --> 05:15:50.920
cilantro it tastes nasty

05:15:50.920 --> 05:15:52.920
I'm so sorry

05:15:52.920 --> 05:15:54.920
I apologize to those

05:15:54.920 --> 05:15:56.920
who have

05:15:56.920 --> 05:15:58.920
who do enjoy cilantro

05:15:58.920 --> 05:16:00.920
yes I have the soap gene

05:16:00.920 --> 05:16:02.920
I cannot even describe to you how nasty

05:16:02.920 --> 05:16:04.920
and completely

05:16:04.920 --> 05:16:06.920
ruins in any trace of it

05:16:06.920 --> 05:16:08.920
in the food completely ruins the food as well

05:16:08.920 --> 05:16:10.920
it is a

05:16:10.920 --> 05:16:12.920
unlucky and unfun gene

05:16:12.920 --> 05:16:14.920
to have

05:16:14.920 --> 05:16:16.920
isn't it genetic

05:16:16.920 --> 05:16:18.920
I don't know if it's genetic

05:16:18.920 --> 05:16:20.920
my dad

05:16:20.920 --> 05:16:22.920
I think eats it fine

05:16:22.920 --> 05:16:24.920
because one time

05:16:24.920 --> 05:16:26.920
he made like is it

05:16:26.920 --> 05:16:28.920
Pico de Mayo or something

05:16:28.920 --> 05:16:30.920
I'm so sorry I think I butchered that

05:16:30.920 --> 05:16:32.920
he made it and I tasted it

05:16:32.920 --> 05:16:34.920
and I was like this is nasty

05:16:34.920 --> 05:16:36.920
but I never said that to him I just said

05:16:36.920 --> 05:16:38.920
oh I don't think my taste buds agree with that

05:16:38.920 --> 05:16:40.920
I never said anything but it's because of the cilantro

05:16:40.920 --> 05:16:42.920
in it

05:16:42.920 --> 05:16:44.920
Pico de Gallo

05:16:44.920 --> 05:16:46.920
okay sorry

05:16:46.920 --> 05:16:48.920
Pico de Gallo

05:16:48.920 --> 05:16:50.920
yes I think my dad tried to make some of it at home

05:16:50.920 --> 05:16:52.920
and

05:16:52.920 --> 05:16:54.920
yeah I was like

05:16:54.920 --> 05:16:56.920
nope

05:17:00.920 --> 05:17:02.920
a bit of Boko no Pico

05:17:02.920 --> 05:17:04.920
no Boko no Pico in it

05:17:04.920 --> 05:17:06.920
yeah

05:17:06.920 --> 05:17:08.920
I'm a fair share of it

05:17:08.920 --> 05:17:10.920
absolutely horrific things I've consumed

05:17:10.920 --> 05:17:12.920
where's the yellow thing

05:17:12.920 --> 05:17:14.920
oh that reminds me of it

05:17:14.920 --> 05:17:16.920
we need to do a watch along

05:17:16.920 --> 05:17:18.920
of Kevin Bridges

05:17:18.920 --> 05:17:20.920
um

05:17:20.920 --> 05:17:22.920
Kevin Bridges

05:17:22.920 --> 05:17:24.920
is a Scottish comedian you might know

05:17:24.920 --> 05:17:26.920
someone called Frankie Boyle

05:17:26.920 --> 05:17:28.920
or what's the other Scottish

05:17:28.920 --> 05:17:30.920
comedian's name and I've forgotten his name

05:17:30.920 --> 05:17:32.920
and he's got Parkinson's right now

05:17:32.920 --> 05:17:34.920
but he's still alive I'm pretty sure

05:17:36.920 --> 05:17:38.920
and he's got a beard and kind of

05:17:38.920 --> 05:17:40.920
big

05:17:40.920 --> 05:17:42.920
not curly hair but wavy hair

05:17:42.920 --> 05:17:44.920
and he's older

05:17:44.920 --> 05:17:46.920
oh my god what's his name

05:17:48.920 --> 05:17:50.920
Billy Conley oh

05:17:50.920 --> 05:17:52.920
Billy Conley

05:17:52.920 --> 05:17:54.920
it took me so long to get there

05:17:54.920 --> 05:17:56.920
holy crap Billy Conley

05:17:56.920 --> 05:17:58.920
hold on I need to drink my tea before I get sick

05:17:58.920 --> 05:18:00.920
mhm

05:18:00.920 --> 05:18:02.920
mhm

05:18:02.920 --> 05:18:04.920
mhm

05:18:04.920 --> 05:18:06.920
so I put far too much

05:18:06.920 --> 05:18:08.920
honey in my first team and I put far too much

05:18:08.920 --> 05:18:10.920
little I can never find the balance

05:18:10.920 --> 05:18:12.920
Billy Conley

05:18:12.920 --> 05:18:14.920
is like real Scots I'm gonna do

05:18:14.920 --> 05:18:16.920
watch alongs of like

05:18:16.920 --> 05:18:18.920
Scottish comedy so

05:18:18.920 --> 05:18:20.920
you guys can laugh and I can be like

05:18:20.920 --> 05:18:22.920
why are the reeflings running in an X pattern

05:18:22.920 --> 05:18:24.920
so they are

05:18:24.920 --> 05:18:26.920
assigned each other to follow each other

05:18:26.920 --> 05:18:28.920
which is causing this four way

05:18:28.920 --> 05:18:30.920
oh my god what are you doing over there

05:18:34.920 --> 05:18:36.920
so they're not actually clicking anymore

05:18:36.920 --> 05:18:38.920
their characters are following

05:18:38.920 --> 05:18:40.920
each other which is causing an infinite loop

05:18:40.920 --> 05:18:42.920
which is pretty cool

05:18:44.920 --> 05:18:46.920
wait you don't pronounce the second

05:18:46.920 --> 05:18:48.920
Billy Conley

05:18:48.920 --> 05:18:50.920
oh Billy Conley sorry

05:18:50.920 --> 05:18:52.920
Billy Conley I'm not good with names

05:18:52.920 --> 05:18:54.920
so don't expect any

05:18:54.920 --> 05:18:56.920
don't expect a miracle with me ok

05:18:56.920 --> 05:18:58.920
it's a scrawny summoning ritual

05:18:58.920 --> 05:19:00.920
down with black rock

05:19:04.920 --> 05:19:06.920
I love Kevin Bridges

05:19:06.920 --> 05:19:08.920
my brother served him at a local club

05:19:08.920 --> 05:19:10.920
he lives close to me oh that's amazing

05:19:10.920 --> 05:19:12.920
I really enjoy Kevin Bridges humour

05:19:12.920 --> 05:19:14.920
because it's quite

05:19:14.920 --> 05:19:16.920
deadpan like British

05:19:16.920 --> 05:19:18.920
humour is quite deadpan so

05:19:18.920 --> 05:19:20.920
we'll probably do a watch

05:19:20.920 --> 05:19:22.920
hey you're getting sturdy with it

05:19:22.920 --> 05:19:24.920
hold on hold on hold on let me just

05:19:24.920 --> 05:19:26.920
get the fish out of the bank first

05:19:26.920 --> 05:19:28.920
hey reefling getting sturdy with it

05:19:34.920 --> 05:19:36.920
I love all these emotes in the game

05:19:36.920 --> 05:19:38.920
I haven't unlocked any more but

05:19:38.920 --> 05:19:40.920
other than the default ones

05:19:42.920 --> 05:19:44.920
this stomped on raught route

05:19:44.920 --> 05:19:46.920
really sells me on the cult vibes

05:19:46.920 --> 05:19:48.920
oh she be playing cult of the lamb

05:19:48.920 --> 05:19:50.920
did she finish it yet

05:19:50.920 --> 05:19:52.920
I think she was so close to finishing it

05:19:52.920 --> 05:19:54.920
at last on you but maybe she did it

05:19:58.920 --> 05:20:00.920
hydration

05:20:02.920 --> 05:20:04.920
gears are quid

05:20:04.920 --> 05:20:06.920
you're getting stabbed is a great one

05:20:06.920 --> 05:20:08.920
it is oh my god

05:20:08.920 --> 05:20:10.920
oh fat boy

05:20:10.920 --> 05:20:12.920
I know this makes no

05:20:12.920 --> 05:20:14.920
I'm gonna tell Kevin Bridges

05:20:14.920 --> 05:20:16.920
his joke ok

05:20:16.920 --> 05:20:18.920
so Kevin Bridges is

05:20:18.920 --> 05:20:20.920
a man and he's quite large in size

05:20:20.920 --> 05:20:22.920
I think he's lost a weight since or whatever

05:20:22.920 --> 05:20:24.920
but he said he was like 25 stone

05:20:24.920 --> 05:20:26.920
or something which is big

05:20:26.920 --> 05:20:28.920
and he was telling the story

05:20:28.920 --> 05:20:30.920
where he's out late at night

05:20:30.920 --> 05:20:32.920
waiting on the bus

05:20:32.920 --> 05:20:34.920
and some net comes up and goes

05:20:34.920 --> 05:20:36.920
oh fat boy

05:20:36.920 --> 05:20:38.920
gears are quid or you're getting stabbed

05:20:38.920 --> 05:20:40.920
and then he's like

05:20:40.920 --> 05:20:42.920
so I start calculating my BMI

05:20:42.920 --> 05:20:44.920
with the other people around me

05:20:44.920 --> 05:20:46.920
type thing

05:20:46.920 --> 05:20:48.920
and this retains that it's him

05:20:48.920 --> 05:20:50.920
that's been picked on by this person

05:20:52.920 --> 05:20:54.920
and he's like in order

05:20:54.920 --> 05:20:56.920
to avoid this heinous act

05:20:56.920 --> 05:20:58.920
against me

05:20:58.920 --> 05:21:00.920
for the mere price of a quid

05:21:00.920 --> 05:21:02.920
I think that's a pretty good bargain

05:21:02.920 --> 05:21:04.920
so he did not get stabbed that night

05:21:06.920 --> 05:21:08.920
that's the best I can do for telling the joke

05:21:08.920 --> 05:21:10.920
but it's a really good joke

05:21:10.920 --> 05:21:12.920
I'll get us to do a watch along

05:21:12.920 --> 05:21:14.920
Kevin Bridges

05:21:14.920 --> 05:21:16.920
he's a local co-op

05:21:16.920 --> 05:21:18.920
I know I'm going to play with sheebie

05:21:18.920 --> 05:21:20.920
and we'll force her to play with me

05:21:20.920 --> 05:21:22.920
he used to weigh about 350 pounds

05:21:22.920 --> 05:21:24.920
woo

05:21:24.920 --> 05:21:26.920
oh isn't there

05:21:26.920 --> 05:21:28.920
there's an American place that lets you eat for free

05:21:28.920 --> 05:21:30.920
um

05:21:30.920 --> 05:21:32.920
if you're over like

05:21:32.920 --> 05:21:34.920
heart attack grill oh my god I'm so sorry

05:21:34.920 --> 05:21:36.920
I look at videos of heart attack grill

05:21:36.920 --> 05:21:38.920
I think it's so fascinating

05:21:38.920 --> 05:21:40.920
um

05:21:40.920 --> 05:21:42.920
there's like a weight outside the restaurant

05:21:42.920 --> 05:21:44.920
if you are over that weight

05:21:44.920 --> 05:21:46.920
you get to eat for free

05:21:46.920 --> 05:21:48.920
I'm like wow

05:21:48.920 --> 05:21:50.920
25 stone equals 160 kg

05:21:50.920 --> 05:21:52.920
mmm

05:21:52.920 --> 05:21:54.920
what are you going to do

05:21:54.920 --> 05:21:56.920
stab him

05:21:56.920 --> 05:21:58.920
he says as he gets shanked

05:21:58.920 --> 05:22:00.920
I was a bit premature there

05:22:00.920 --> 05:22:02.920
wow we are like

05:22:02.920 --> 05:22:04.920
burning through these

05:22:04.920 --> 05:22:06.920
well I don't know what level

05:22:06.920 --> 05:22:08.920
I can cook those

05:22:08.920 --> 05:22:10.920
octopusies

05:22:10.920 --> 05:22:12.920
but

05:22:12.920 --> 05:22:14.920
I think we'll go to the grand exchange

05:22:14.920 --> 05:22:16.920
and buy some I have a terrible feeling

05:22:16.920 --> 05:22:18.920
they are

05:22:18.920 --> 05:22:20.920
a membership only

05:22:20.920 --> 05:22:22.920
item

05:22:22.920 --> 05:22:24.920
so we might have to swap to a membership world

05:22:24.920 --> 05:22:26.920
which is a shame for anyone who's not a member

05:22:26.920 --> 05:22:28.920
the heart attack grill

05:22:28.920 --> 05:22:30.920
mmm

05:22:32.920 --> 05:22:34.920
isn't heart attack grill

05:22:34.920 --> 05:22:36.920
just a place because the owner hates fat people

05:22:36.920 --> 05:22:38.920
and wants them to die

05:22:38.920 --> 05:22:40.920
is that the lore

05:22:40.920 --> 05:22:42.920
or

05:22:42.920 --> 05:22:44.920
wines is probably better

05:22:44.920 --> 05:22:46.920
at that point

05:22:46.920 --> 05:22:48.920
wait carabaan

05:22:48.920 --> 05:22:50.920
wines better than carabaan

05:22:50.920 --> 05:22:52.920
caramwa

05:22:52.920 --> 05:22:54.920
I'm sorry

05:22:54.920 --> 05:22:56.920
I'm not saying that right

05:22:56.920 --> 05:22:58.920
I'm not even going to pretend I'm saying it right

05:22:58.920 --> 05:23:00.920
what level cooking

05:23:00.920 --> 05:23:02.920
I am 70 on the dot

05:23:04.920 --> 05:23:06.920
I'm revealing someone

05:23:06.920 --> 05:23:08.920
I'm going to get some octopusies

05:23:10.920 --> 05:23:12.920
honestly mate

05:23:12.920 --> 05:23:14.920
honestly mate

05:23:14.920 --> 05:23:16.920
right I've had a nature valley bar

05:23:16.920 --> 05:23:18.920
I've had a muffin and I don't actually feel like eating

05:23:18.920 --> 05:23:20.920
that's what I'm saying when a stream

05:23:20.920 --> 05:23:22.920
I don't feel like eating properly

05:23:22.920 --> 05:23:24.920
tick manipulation

05:23:24.920 --> 05:23:26.920
oh I'm not that good at the game

05:23:26.920 --> 05:23:28.920
I'm not that good at the game

05:23:28.920 --> 05:23:30.920
tick manipulation

05:23:30.920 --> 05:23:32.920
fat chance of me

05:23:32.920 --> 05:23:34.920
eh

05:23:36.920 --> 05:23:38.920
wa wa wa

05:23:44.920 --> 05:23:46.920
oh boy

05:23:46.920 --> 05:23:48.920
really going to get me a bye memory

05:23:48.920 --> 05:23:50.920
wait until we've decided on what's going on

05:23:52.920 --> 05:23:54.920
are you squidding me right now

05:23:56.920 --> 05:23:58.920
kill more

05:23:58.920 --> 05:24:00.920
combine

05:24:02.920 --> 05:24:04.920
what are you saying

05:24:04.920 --> 05:24:06.920
redheads are from Ireland

05:24:06.920 --> 05:24:08.920
and I said redheads came from Scotland

05:24:08.920 --> 05:24:10.920
Ireland has a higher redhead

05:24:10.920 --> 05:24:12.920
percentage

05:24:12.920 --> 05:24:14.920
I believe

05:24:14.920 --> 05:24:16.920
but you must

05:24:16.920 --> 05:24:18.920
acknowledge with that

05:24:18.920 --> 05:24:20.920
that due to the Irish

05:24:20.920 --> 05:24:22.920
potato famine

05:24:22.920 --> 05:24:24.920
which was actually just a British government

05:24:24.920 --> 05:24:26.920
starving the people

05:24:26.920 --> 05:24:28.920
a lot of Irish migrants

05:24:28.920 --> 05:24:30.920
went into Scotland

05:24:30.920 --> 05:24:32.920
because it's a

05:24:32.920 --> 05:24:34.920
very close company

05:24:34.920 --> 05:24:36.920
company

05:24:38.920 --> 05:24:40.920
thank you for the 5

05:24:40.920 --> 05:24:42.920
but I want to say

05:24:42.920 --> 05:24:44.920
I think your girlfriend's right where the redheads

05:24:44.920 --> 05:24:46.920
are from Ireland

05:24:48.920 --> 05:24:50.920
give them to Mumme

05:24:50.920 --> 05:24:52.920
wait what

05:24:52.920 --> 05:24:54.920
he wants my winemaking supplies

05:24:54.920 --> 05:24:56.920
wait is wine faster

05:24:56.920 --> 05:24:58.920
hold on

05:24:58.920 --> 05:25:00.920
I'm banking

05:25:00.920 --> 05:25:02.920
what does wine look like

05:25:02.920 --> 05:25:04.920
how do I get wine

05:25:04.920 --> 05:25:06.920
Shawnee if you right click game at the bottom of the screen

05:25:06.920 --> 05:25:08.920
and click

05:25:08.920 --> 05:25:10.920
game

05:25:10.920 --> 05:25:12.920
Shawnee if you right click game at the bottom of the screen

05:25:12.920 --> 05:25:14.920
and click filler

05:25:14.920 --> 05:25:16.920
it will hate all the cooking messages

05:25:16.920 --> 05:25:18.920
oh

05:25:34.920 --> 05:25:36.920
thank you

05:25:36.920 --> 05:25:38.920
Gael Gantres

05:25:38.920 --> 05:25:40.920
for becoming a member

05:25:40.920 --> 05:25:42.920
I appreciate it

05:25:42.920 --> 05:25:44.920
government starving people

05:25:44.920 --> 05:25:51.480
bet that hasn't even happened to tons of other countries as well. Redheads are from the Northern

05:25:52.360 --> 05:25:59.560
Kingdom Catholics. I actually have the redhead gene so if any refling has it too and you want to

05:26:00.440 --> 05:26:09.320
rendezvous with me we might make more Emmys. What? That's a lot! Wait how do I do that?

05:26:10.200 --> 05:26:14.840
oh wait wait wait hold on hold on hold on thank you so much refling oh my god wait what do i do though

05:26:15.800 --> 05:26:18.120
hold on hold on give the thing give the thing

05:26:20.920 --> 05:26:28.440
take out 14 i think i take take out 14 and then shove them together like this is this faster?

05:26:31.640 --> 05:26:33.480
oh i don't know if it is this faster

05:26:34.280 --> 05:26:38.920
oh thanks for the two

05:26:45.160 --> 05:26:52.360
let's make more Gert gingers together right and then do it like this okay that worked

05:26:55.080 --> 05:27:00.520
make sure you do it every 14 seconds so you get a huge xv drop put 14 in the bank and then combine

05:27:01.240 --> 05:27:04.360
the chat it gives about 2200 average

05:27:06.440 --> 05:27:13.000
huh so this is more or less than cooking the swordies

05:27:14.760 --> 05:27:17.640
i gotta go for i've got 14 second random timer

05:27:18.840 --> 05:27:24.680

you're just like oh god i can't watch this anymore that's what two clicks

05:28:32.040 --> 05:28:37.880
now it's fun to watch you can't get bad wine because you're such high level

05:28:38.840 --> 05:28:42.120
so you pull it 14 each and can bank all after

05:28:55.080 --> 05:28:59.000

05:32:45.480 --> 05:32:54.920

05:33:07.960 --> 05:33:15.000
of isaac because someone did a cheeky datamine when they shouldn't have um and there was something

05:33:15.000 --> 05:33:24.840
called the repentance plus it is possible empty sack click click combine yes i might need to do that

05:33:24.840 --> 05:33:40.120
escape thing honestly um you can set buttons to escape in space honestly um yeah so it's possible

05:33:40.120 --> 05:33:46.920
there might be an item update i am not parent sorry and hold on hold on i can't talk into that

05:33:46.920 --> 05:33:51.960
at the same time it's possible that they're gonna have a slight change to some items and all that

05:33:51.960 --> 05:33:58.440
jazz the dlc does come out in november which means we can all play multiplayer together and i'm going

it would be really empty sack it would be really good to get dead god together i think that would

05:34:14.760 --> 05:34:20.440
be crazy because it would make it so much easier of all through like the max lobby size is four

05:34:20.440 --> 05:34:25.960
so three reeflings at a time can do a run with me and and i'll just do it the way we did with

oh my god this is i will say the cooking was a lot easier to read stream the only thing i

05:37:54.200 --> 05:37:56.840
I don't like about Wines as it's over so quickly.

05:37:58.280 --> 05:38:00.680
It's over so quickly, it's so quick.

05:38:01.720 --> 05:38:03.240
I can't reach out and think.

05:38:03.960 --> 05:38:08.600
Either die here, a hero, or live long enough to be on the market.

05:38:09.240 --> 05:38:09.800
Honestly.

05:38:10.600 --> 05:38:13.080
Oh god, my brain can't keep up with this.

05:38:13.080 --> 05:38:13.560
Escape.

05:38:14.200 --> 05:38:17.320
God, we're even, we're at like almost 5k grade.

05:38:17.880 --> 05:38:20.040
Wait, oh sorry, I was supposed to do space one up.

05:38:21.640 --> 05:38:23.560
Do you plan on making an old school runescape pop?

05:38:23.560 --> 05:38:25.160
No, I don't know what planning is.

05:38:25.160 --> 05:38:27.400
I've never done it or been in one before.

05:38:27.400 --> 05:38:31.720
I just used to be the scammer at the exchange post that was like double in money.

05:38:31.720 --> 05:38:32.280
That's me.

05:38:33.240 --> 05:38:34.040
That's what I did.

05:38:35.800 --> 05:38:36.680
I can't believe it.

05:38:36.680 --> 05:38:37.480
I can't believe it.

05:38:39.400 --> 05:38:40.360
Wait, combine?

05:38:40.360 --> 05:38:41.800
Oh, I never hit escape that time.

05:38:46.920 --> 05:38:48.120
Wait, what?

05:38:48.120 --> 05:38:49.800
Did Stony cause a spike?

05:38:49.800 --> 05:38:53.240
Apparently the price of trout is going really weird right now.

05:38:53.720 --> 05:38:57.400
Stony took all my money.

05:38:57.400 --> 05:38:59.480
I'm sorry, I took your 1000 gold.

05:38:59.480 --> 05:39:04.280
I assure you I did absolutely nothing with it because I abandoned the account probably and never bothered again.

05:39:05.960 --> 05:39:06.760
Price trout.

05:39:07.720 --> 05:39:09.480
Trout is 41.

05:39:12.520 --> 05:39:13.240
Raw trout.

05:39:15.800 --> 05:39:18.120
190 for raw trout.

05:39:19.320 --> 05:39:21.160
Quick selling for like 189.

05:39:23.560 --> 05:39:24.520
Did we actually?

05:39:24.520 --> 05:39:25.080
One goes.

05:39:25.640 --> 05:39:27.000
Oh wait, sorry, sorry.

05:39:27.000 --> 05:39:28.120
I'm messing up the struts.

05:39:30.600 --> 05:39:33.800
Stony drawing a big tentacle in the price chart.

05:39:40.920 --> 05:39:45.720
Well, I'm happy that we at least reached 70.

05:39:47.720 --> 05:39:49.080
That is good.

05:39:49.720 --> 05:39:51.480
Sorry, I'm messing up the strut.

05:39:51.480 --> 05:39:52.280
Please don't look.

05:39:52.280 --> 05:39:53.560
Please don't look, I'm embarrassed.

05:39:53.560 --> 05:39:58.040
Um, I don't know what we're going to end on.

05:39:58.040 --> 05:40:03.240
If we do, I think someone said it was like five endurance streams.

05:40:03.240 --> 05:40:07.240
If I just like non-stop did this, then I would reach it.

05:40:07.240 --> 05:40:08.280
I was hoping.

05:40:11.640 --> 05:40:13.080
Wait, oh no, I messed that up.

05:40:13.080 --> 05:40:14.680
Oh no, it's going to ferment.

05:40:14.680 --> 05:40:19.000
Don't ferment, don't ferment, don't ferment, don't ferment, don't ferment.

05:40:19.880 --> 05:40:25.800
I was like, honestly, it's less about being efficient and more about saving our hands.

05:40:27.800 --> 05:40:30.520
So you guys don't have to stoke the fire for me all the time.

05:40:38.600 --> 05:40:39.100
Wah.

05:40:40.200 --> 05:40:43.480
Bing, bang, boom, bat pal.

05:40:44.600 --> 05:40:47.080
Ah, I completely did not strut that up, but whatever.

05:40:48.040 --> 05:40:51.320
Eh, Stronner really wants that giant XP bomb.

05:40:51.320 --> 05:40:55.640
Well, I'm wondering, could we just keep doing it until they're all gone?

05:40:55.640 --> 05:41:00.280
I don't know how long it takes to do 6,000 wines though.

05:41:00.280 --> 05:41:05.400
I could only do 14 per inventory slot, which is a bit of a problem.

05:41:07.240 --> 05:41:10.440
So I need like just, what, 14?

05:41:11.640 --> 05:41:15.000
How many 14s does it take to get to 100?

05:41:15.000 --> 05:41:15.560
I don't know.

05:41:17.400 --> 05:41:20.280
But I'm gonna be here for a while, I think.

05:41:20.280 --> 05:41:21.240
Or is it 6?

05:41:22.600 --> 05:41:23.480
No, 14.

05:41:24.600 --> 05:41:26.520
My right wrist is death messed up.

05:41:26.520 --> 05:41:28.040
Oh my god, are you okay, Riefling?

05:41:28.600 --> 05:41:29.320
From this game?

05:41:29.320 --> 05:41:30.520
Because you've been playing this game?

05:41:33.560 --> 05:41:34.520
So many grapes.

05:41:36.920 --> 05:41:39.240
Wait, people just XP bomb for fun?

05:41:41.960 --> 05:41:42.680
Mostly yes.

05:41:42.840 --> 05:41:43.480
It's not cool.

05:41:45.240 --> 05:41:47.720
Keep going to click on that guy, but I'm not to click on him.

05:41:48.680 --> 05:41:51.160
Right, empty the sack.

05:41:51.160 --> 05:41:52.840
Click on the ingredients.

05:41:52.840 --> 05:41:55.560
Escape, combine, space bar.

05:41:55.560 --> 05:41:56.760
See, I didn't write that time.

05:41:56.760 --> 05:41:59.000
I have to like mentally bring it to my head.

05:42:01.800 --> 05:42:02.360
How much?

05:42:04.600 --> 05:42:05.160
Seven.

05:42:05.160 --> 05:42:08.200
So I need seven inventories to do 100.

05:42:08.200 --> 05:42:09.000
That's quite a lot.

05:42:09.880 --> 05:42:18.440
I've messed up, but that's okay.

05:42:18.440 --> 05:42:19.400
I'm trying my best.

05:42:21.400 --> 05:42:26.440
You need roughly 62k wines to get from 68 to 99.

05:42:26.440 --> 05:42:26.920
Bruv!

05:42:28.120 --> 05:42:29.160
Who picked this?

05:42:29.160 --> 05:42:29.800
Is there not?

05:42:29.800 --> 05:42:31.160
Right, let's do fletching.

05:42:31.160 --> 05:42:32.840
We can do fletching in four hours.

05:42:34.200 --> 05:42:35.720
We're getting how many wines?

05:42:36.280 --> 05:42:38.920
There's no way I can do that.

05:42:39.320 --> 05:42:41.240
I'm starting, oh no, I'm starting to have doubt.

05:42:41.800 --> 05:42:43.400
Reflings, have I messed up?

05:42:44.360 --> 05:42:46.040
Have I messed up picking this game?

05:42:48.280 --> 05:42:50.040
It's 200 XP per wine.

05:42:50.040 --> 05:42:51.240
Oh, that's more than the fish.

05:42:53.080 --> 05:42:55.160
Fletching is death going to mess up your route.

05:42:56.280 --> 05:42:58.120
Have I made a mistake picking King?

05:42:59.400 --> 05:43:00.280
I'm getting nervous.

05:43:00.280 --> 05:43:01.240
I'm getting chicken.

05:43:01.240 --> 05:43:04.360
Now, I did say the next time we do RuneScape,

05:43:05.000 --> 05:43:08.920
I'm going, we're going to do a movie watch along as well,

05:43:09.800 --> 05:43:12.280
just so I can rest my voice.

05:43:16.920 --> 05:43:18.360
How's the cooking going?

05:43:18.360 --> 05:43:20.600
We're starting to feel a bit daunted now,

05:43:20.600 --> 05:43:24.440
and it's starting to settle in like, oh no, this is a lot.

05:43:25.960 --> 05:43:29.640
The next time we do a RuneScape stream,

05:43:29.640 --> 05:43:31.720
we are going to be watching a movie series,

05:43:31.720 --> 05:43:34.040
so I don't have to talk and I can rest my voice a little bit,

05:43:34.040 --> 05:43:36.360
because I do have quite a few ASMR collabs coming up,

05:43:36.360 --> 05:43:39.000
and I need to keep my voice steady.

05:43:39.720 --> 05:43:41.720
I need my voice to be steady and ready.

05:43:42.600 --> 05:43:45.560
Wines are like 480k if you're consistent.

05:43:46.280 --> 05:43:49.960
Per hour, I mean, it's all right.

05:43:53.640 --> 05:43:59.160
You need 87k swordfish, so wines are still faster in the end.

05:43:59.160 --> 05:44:00.360
Oh my gosh.

05:44:00.360 --> 05:44:02.360
Oh.

05:44:05.560 --> 05:44:06.440
Reeflings.

05:44:06.440 --> 05:44:08.760
I think I might have messed up picking cooking,

05:44:09.960 --> 05:44:11.320
but I really want 99.

05:44:11.320 --> 05:44:13.080
I've never had my first 99 before.

05:44:16.280 --> 05:44:18.280
Oh, I'm getting nervous.

05:44:18.280 --> 05:44:19.320
I'm getting shaky.

05:44:19.320 --> 05:44:20.040
Just drain back.

05:44:20.040 --> 05:44:22.040
What's with the ritual dance at the top of the screen?

05:44:22.040 --> 05:44:23.080
Those are reeflings.

05:44:23.080 --> 05:44:24.520
They're just dancing with each other.

05:44:25.160 --> 05:44:26.760
We're all hanging out at the fire.

05:44:27.720 --> 05:44:30.040
Remember, level 92 is halfway.

05:44:30.040 --> 05:44:30.600
Stop.

05:44:30.600 --> 05:44:31.560
Is it actually?

05:44:38.360 --> 05:44:39.160
No.

05:44:39.160 --> 05:44:40.760
I will not give myself doubt.

05:44:42.280 --> 05:44:45.560
I'll see what happens after the movie marathon.

05:44:49.160 --> 05:44:50.760
XP wise, it's halfway.

05:44:51.400 --> 05:44:54.280
I know what happened to the legendary stamina.

05:44:54.280 --> 05:44:55.400
I'm getting nervous.

05:44:55.400 --> 05:44:57.720
I don't know if I have an end in stamina now.

05:44:58.440 --> 05:44:59.400
I'm getting shaky.

05:44:59.400 --> 05:45:00.200
Wait.

05:45:00.200 --> 05:45:00.520
Right.

05:45:00.520 --> 05:45:01.000
Empty.

05:45:06.920 --> 05:45:09.400
Cooking is the fastest without completely ruined.

05:45:09.400 --> 05:45:10.440
Like cooking fish.

05:45:12.280 --> 05:45:15.160
Isn't it good that we'll be there with it?

05:45:17.240 --> 05:45:17.640
Yeah.

05:45:17.640 --> 05:45:19.480
Next runescape stream though.

05:45:19.480 --> 05:45:20.680
I'm going to be watching a movie,

05:45:20.680 --> 05:45:24.680
so I'm not talking too much because my voice is getting shredded.

05:45:25.960 --> 05:45:27.080
But I love it.

05:45:27.080 --> 05:45:27.720
Can't help.

05:45:27.720 --> 05:45:28.680
Can't stop talking.

05:45:28.680 --> 05:45:29.000
Okay.

05:45:33.240 --> 05:45:34.920
Making winds is faster.

05:45:36.840 --> 05:45:39.160
But the reeflings here in 99 shouldn't be a problem.

05:45:39.160 --> 05:45:39.480
Okay.

05:45:39.480 --> 05:45:39.800
Okay.

05:45:39.800 --> 05:45:40.280
Okay.

05:45:44.040 --> 05:45:44.440
Wow.

05:45:45.640 --> 05:45:49.000
Although it'd be really cool to look back and see how much time I spent.

05:45:50.120 --> 05:45:54.200
I wouldn't mind doing some questing after we get 99 cooking.

05:45:54.760 --> 05:46:00.040
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do 99 cooking in one month though.

05:46:00.040 --> 05:46:02.440
Because of the streams that I've got planned out.

05:46:02.440 --> 05:46:04.760
It doesn't really work that well.

05:46:04.760 --> 05:46:05.880
Because of Elden Ring.

05:46:08.840 --> 05:46:09.960
Because of Elden Ring.

05:46:11.960 --> 05:46:15.240
I would have been able to put more time into Rinscape.

05:46:15.240 --> 05:46:16.600
But because of Elden Ring.

05:46:17.560 --> 05:46:18.440
99 cooking.

05:46:18.440 --> 05:46:20.840
That's all because of a mediocre joke.

05:46:20.840 --> 05:46:21.800
That you're a whammin.

05:46:22.360 --> 05:46:22.840
Hell yeah.

05:46:23.640 --> 05:46:24.600
You got this Johnny.

05:46:25.400 --> 05:46:26.520
We'll make you our ma-

05:46:26.520 --> 05:46:27.880
We'll get you a master chef.

05:46:31.720 --> 05:46:37.720
But it would be kind of cool to look back at like the stream thumbnails and see how much time it took.

05:46:38.680 --> 05:46:40.520
Obviously we did some questing.

05:46:40.520 --> 05:46:44.120
The first I had so much fun like doing all those quests and like waiting for everyone

05:46:44.120 --> 05:46:46.280
and be like okay we'll do this next we'll do this next.

05:46:47.080 --> 05:46:52.040
Um so if I do achieve 99 cooking and I'm not burnt out of Rinscape.

05:46:52.920 --> 05:46:55.000
Then pardon me I'm burping away here.

05:46:55.640 --> 05:47:02.440
Uh I actually wouldn't mind um I wouldn't mind what.

05:47:02.440 --> 05:47:05.480
I wouldn't mind doing some more questing again together because that's quite fun.

05:47:05.480 --> 05:47:12.360
And it's more interactive than literally you do need to do a quest to cook a coambas.

05:47:12.360 --> 05:47:15.480
I can never say I don't know what on earth I'm supposed to pronounce them as.

05:47:16.200 --> 05:47:20.600
Um are they better XP than wine?

05:47:20.840 --> 05:47:23.160
This is the question.

05:47:24.440 --> 05:47:27.320
Do I need combat for that quest by any chance?

05:47:32.360 --> 05:47:35.000
50 subs away from 60 stop.

05:47:35.000 --> 05:47:36.760
Is that video still getting traction?

05:47:37.400 --> 05:47:38.920
Yat. Oh my yat.

05:47:39.960 --> 05:47:41.800
Sticking at my yat for the river.

05:47:43.720 --> 05:47:46.040
Oh would a Scottish cover of that go viral?

05:47:46.920 --> 05:47:48.760
Only by tick manipulating.

05:47:48.760 --> 05:47:53.400
Right no if wait so I'm just doing wines for the rest of this entire gig.

05:47:55.480 --> 05:47:59.800
Oh no it's only faster if you're paying attention.

05:48:00.920 --> 05:48:02.760
I'm just doing wines for the rest.

05:48:02.760 --> 05:48:05.080
Oh this is terrible stream content.

05:48:07.160 --> 05:48:10.840
You guys just seem to go back and forth to make more wines.

05:48:10.840 --> 05:48:13.480
Wait so then why was that chick doing lobsters?

05:48:13.720 --> 05:48:17.400
We're the one with the big jibblies out.

05:48:17.400 --> 05:48:19.560
Why does she do lobsters for chicken?

05:48:19.560 --> 05:48:21.160
Is lobsters cheaper?

05:48:21.160 --> 05:48:21.960
Cheaper.

05:48:21.960 --> 05:48:23.160
Can I always switch it up?

05:48:23.160 --> 05:48:25.960
Yeah I'll maybe finish my swordfish.

05:48:25.960 --> 05:48:30.360
Once this batch for a minute I'll swap back to the swordfish.

05:48:30.360 --> 05:48:33.160
Just so like everything the reeflings gave me and being used up.

05:48:33.160 --> 05:48:34.920
That seems like the wisest thing.

05:48:34.920 --> 05:48:35.480
It's cum.

05:48:36.760 --> 05:48:38.520
Oh yeah you like when I yap at you?

05:48:38.520 --> 05:48:40.200
I'll yap all over you.

05:48:40.200 --> 05:48:41.160
All over your face.

05:48:41.720 --> 05:48:42.360
Your stomach.

05:48:43.240 --> 05:48:43.880
Your thighs.

05:48:45.960 --> 05:48:48.840
Fish would be way slower but way less attention.

05:48:48.840 --> 05:48:53.240
Yeah um the wane attention batch is getting pretty rough.

05:48:53.240 --> 05:48:56.280
I know I can I'm sorry I'm touching my boob right now.

05:48:56.280 --> 05:48:59.160
I'm like I'm not even pretending otherwise.

05:48:59.160 --> 05:49:00.920
Um I've only got one hand.

05:49:00.920 --> 05:49:01.800
Available right now.

05:49:04.280 --> 05:49:05.400
We do love the gap.

05:49:05.400 --> 05:49:07.480
You can literally just talk to us for the content.

05:49:07.480 --> 05:49:08.680
That's why I'm here.

05:49:13.320 --> 05:49:17.240
Oh no right.

05:49:17.960 --> 05:49:20.920
I think we can finish off the swordfish and the wane.

05:49:23.160 --> 05:49:26.440
Also it was actually really funny that you just straight up handed me like your

05:49:26.440 --> 05:49:27.400
wane collection.

05:49:27.400 --> 05:49:28.280
No questions.

05:49:28.280 --> 05:49:29.640
You're not like no this is mine.

05:49:29.640 --> 05:49:31.160
You're just like I hear habits Johnny.

05:49:32.360 --> 05:49:34.600
That's quite funny actually now that I think about it.

05:49:34.600 --> 05:49:36.280
You're like oh there's no point in arguing.

05:49:36.280 --> 05:49:36.920
She can have it.

05:49:37.880 --> 05:49:40.600
Um wow.

05:49:42.040 --> 05:49:43.160
Wow you did it.

05:49:46.360 --> 05:49:46.840
Rank.

05:49:49.000 --> 05:49:49.480
Wow.

05:49:51.400 --> 05:49:52.520
Oh that's so big.

05:49:54.200 --> 05:49:55.080
Thanks so much.

05:49:56.280 --> 05:50:00.440
Oh you can get it.

05:50:01.240 --> 05:50:02.840
Oh sorry I'm getting distracted.

05:50:02.840 --> 05:50:03.880
Wane don't ferment.

05:50:03.880 --> 05:50:04.840
I got distracted.

05:50:04.840 --> 05:50:05.800
I was reading.

05:50:05.800 --> 05:50:06.440
Don't ferment.

05:50:06.440 --> 05:50:07.080
Don't ferment.

05:50:10.440 --> 05:50:12.120
Your yapping is so strong.

05:50:12.120 --> 05:50:14.360
You forgot that you were also playing RuneScape.

05:50:14.360 --> 05:50:16.440
The game is more a background to you.

05:50:16.440 --> 05:50:16.920
Honestly.

05:50:17.640 --> 05:50:19.560
Reef was trying to get a moment of rope.

05:50:19.560 --> 05:50:20.840
With all this wine.

05:50:20.840 --> 05:50:21.480
Exactly.

05:50:23.480 --> 05:50:26.120
Forfeit all mortal possessions to the cult of vice.

05:50:26.120 --> 05:50:27.880
No look after yourself.

05:50:27.880 --> 05:50:29.160
Get yourself out of debt.

05:50:29.960 --> 05:50:32.360
Buy yourself treaties at the corner shop.

05:50:33.240 --> 05:50:34.680
And then and only then.

05:50:35.800 --> 05:50:37.560
The fermentation is top left.

05:50:37.560 --> 05:50:38.040
Oh.

05:50:40.360 --> 05:50:41.080
Wow.

05:50:41.080 --> 05:50:41.880
That's so cool.

05:50:41.880 --> 05:50:43.000
Man Rune.

05:50:43.000 --> 05:50:45.400
Rune light plug-in is so good.

05:50:47.720 --> 05:50:48.760
We're learning.

05:50:48.760 --> 05:50:49.400
We're learning.

05:50:56.600 --> 05:50:57.320
Plap plap plap.

05:50:57.320 --> 05:50:57.880
Don't ferment.

05:50:57.880 --> 05:50:58.440
Don't ferment.

05:50:58.440 --> 05:50:59.240
Don't ferment.

05:50:59.240 --> 05:51:00.920
I was actually there is like this

05:51:00.920 --> 05:51:02.680
feature of her that posted a thing.

05:51:03.240 --> 05:51:04.360
Where this song's like.

05:51:04.520 --> 05:51:08.040
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

05:51:08.040 --> 05:51:10.680
And she goes get pregnant get pregnant get pregnant get pregnant get pregnant.

05:51:10.680 --> 05:51:13.480
And I was gonna remake it and be like.

05:51:13.480 --> 05:51:15.880
Get pregnant get main break get main break get main break.

05:51:15.880 --> 05:51:17.240
But I can't say it that fast.

05:51:18.680 --> 05:51:21.800
But I was gonna add like plap sound effects and all that and the music.

05:51:21.800 --> 05:51:24.200
And like plap plap and then do my hypnosis thing.

05:51:25.000 --> 05:51:27.800
Also that timer stuff can be moved by holding O and dragging it.

05:51:28.520 --> 05:51:31.080
I'll leave it in the top corner where it belongs for now.

05:51:35.000 --> 05:51:36.200
Mm mm mm mm.

05:51:39.880 --> 05:51:42.120
Was that the one by someone underscore?

05:51:42.120 --> 05:51:45.160
It was um it got like 6,000 likes.

05:51:45.160 --> 05:51:47.880
And I was like oh my god I want to make a rifling version of that.

05:51:49.000 --> 05:51:51.640
So I was like get main break get main break get main break get main break.

05:51:53.160 --> 05:51:53.400
Yeah.

05:51:56.360 --> 05:52:00.840
Oh I keep going to click on the banker but she's not gone.

05:52:00.840 --> 05:52:02.440
I don't need to do that.

05:52:02.440 --> 05:52:04.200
God there's so much going on over there.

05:52:04.760 --> 05:52:05.800
You can perish it.

05:52:10.840 --> 05:52:12.040
I think I remember seeing that.

05:52:12.040 --> 05:52:15.240
Yeah I like went pretty viral and I saw it and I was like oh my god I want a rifling version.

05:52:15.240 --> 05:52:17.000
So I'm gonna put my hypno eyes on and stuff.

05:52:17.560 --> 05:52:19.880
I'd be all hey pregnant go pregnant go.

05:52:19.880 --> 05:52:21.480
Well I'm not pregnant in your case.

05:52:23.320 --> 05:52:24.680
Get your boy pregnant.

05:52:25.960 --> 05:52:26.760
Not really for me.

05:52:29.240 --> 05:52:31.560
Astrony you can't imagine what's happening by the way.

05:52:31.560 --> 05:52:32.840
Wait why what do you mean?

05:52:37.000 --> 05:52:38.360
What does that mean?

05:52:38.360 --> 05:52:39.800
Why does that sound like a veiled?

05:52:41.480 --> 05:52:41.880
Truth.

05:52:45.240 --> 05:52:48.280
I mean we're almost at 4k water.

05:52:48.280 --> 05:52:50.280
We've just done about 500 there.

05:52:51.720 --> 05:52:57.000
I'm wondering if I can do it in one sitting and just let the XP pop and then I'll be satisfied with that.

05:52:57.960 --> 05:53:00.840
Oh maybe.

05:53:00.840 --> 05:53:02.840
Maybe baby if I don't mess it up.

05:53:03.800 --> 05:53:04.120
What?

05:53:05.400 --> 05:53:07.400
Hello I want to grab that.

05:53:07.400 --> 05:53:08.600
Oh my god.

05:53:09.960 --> 05:53:12.200
Riflings are such sugar daddies.

05:53:13.000 --> 05:53:15.960
That was 7 million just hanging out on a table.

05:53:17.960 --> 05:53:19.960
I literally actually did a gilded.

05:53:19.960 --> 05:53:23.480
Someone got into dropping a gilded freaking plate armor.

05:53:23.640 --> 05:53:27.640
People are storming the channel.

05:53:28.440 --> 05:53:29.720
Are y'all winning, Astrony?

05:53:32.200 --> 05:53:33.320
Get in pregnant.

05:53:33.320 --> 05:53:34.840
Yeah I've never really been.

05:53:36.280 --> 05:53:39.480
I mean I'll cater to everyone but it's not wrong for me.

05:53:42.360 --> 05:53:47.080
I'm pretty sure the viral version was either they get pregnant by it or get me pregnant.

05:53:49.240 --> 05:53:52.040
No Shiori no it wasn't that one.

05:53:53.640 --> 05:53:54.840
I didn't see the Shiori.

05:53:54.840 --> 05:54:01.800
I know what the Shiori one is but I definitely must have seen it from the other chick.

05:54:09.240 --> 05:54:10.120
I want to grab that.

05:54:11.560 --> 05:54:12.840
Astrony reading my words.

05:54:13.960 --> 05:54:14.600
I want to grab that.

05:54:14.600 --> 05:54:15.480
Let me shake your hand.

05:54:17.880 --> 05:54:19.800
I'm already here lord of storms.

05:54:23.720 --> 05:54:31.160
I'm just going to check when Azur comes.

05:54:32.280 --> 05:54:33.480
What was that noise?

05:54:33.480 --> 05:54:37.000
Why is that a look away for a millisecond and there's lots of weird noises going on?

05:54:37.640 --> 05:54:38.280
Hold on.

05:54:38.280 --> 05:54:38.920
Hold on.

05:54:38.920 --> 05:54:40.280
Let me check when Azur comes on.

05:54:41.560 --> 05:54:42.360
Subscriptions.

05:54:44.680 --> 05:54:45.320
Azur.

05:54:45.320 --> 05:54:48.200
Why does it not say Azur is coming up next?

05:54:48.200 --> 05:54:49.160
That's so annoying.

05:54:51.960 --> 05:54:52.600
Oh no!

05:54:52.600 --> 05:54:53.320
Oh my freaking...

05:54:54.600 --> 05:54:55.400
Wait I'm going to do it.

05:54:55.400 --> 05:54:55.960
I'm going to do it.

05:54:55.960 --> 05:54:56.520
I'm going to do it.

05:55:02.520 --> 05:55:05.240
How could I forget the Wayne fermentation?

05:55:05.960 --> 05:55:07.880
How could I have been so silly?

05:55:08.840 --> 05:55:10.520
I just wanted to make sure when Azur was coming on.

05:55:11.640 --> 05:55:13.000
Level 72.

05:55:13.000 --> 05:55:13.960
Right I'll take it.

05:55:13.960 --> 05:55:14.920
Level 72.

05:55:16.520 --> 05:55:18.040
That's actually not that bad though.

05:55:19.080 --> 05:55:20.040
I'm quite happy with that.

05:55:23.000 --> 05:55:25.320
198k?

05:55:25.320 --> 05:55:26.520
198k?

05:55:26.520 --> 05:55:27.160
Seriously?

05:55:29.400 --> 05:55:29.880
Whoops.

05:55:31.320 --> 05:55:32.440
That was good though.

05:55:35.080 --> 05:55:35.960
That was really good.

05:55:35.960 --> 05:55:38.680
Okay maybe Wayne's is the way to go because

05:55:40.200 --> 05:55:41.080
big if true.

05:55:42.840 --> 05:55:45.400
And I'm not even finished fermenting all the wine that I've got.

05:55:46.440 --> 05:55:46.840
Hold on.

05:55:46.840 --> 05:55:50.600
I'm going to put the heating on because I'm absolutely frozen in my room.

05:55:53.160 --> 05:55:53.660
Oh.

05:55:58.680 --> 05:55:59.080
God.

05:56:00.680 --> 05:56:02.360
It's 15 degrees.

05:56:02.360 --> 05:56:04.520
How am I supposed to survive in these conditions?

05:56:05.640 --> 05:56:14.040
Yeah apparently um Australian I rent um but oh where my key?

05:56:14.040 --> 05:56:14.520
Hold on.

05:56:14.520 --> 05:56:15.160
Cable?

05:56:15.160 --> 05:56:15.640
Cable?

05:56:15.640 --> 05:56:16.360
Hold on.

05:56:16.360 --> 05:56:16.920
Okay I've got it.

05:56:16.920 --> 05:56:17.160
I've got it.

05:56:19.160 --> 05:56:22.360
I just I just popped the last into this 73.

05:56:22.360 --> 05:56:25.480
I would have jumped three levels if I managed to do one more batch.

05:56:25.480 --> 05:56:26.040
All right hold on.

05:56:26.040 --> 05:56:28.280
Let's see what's going on with my Azura Deleu.

05:56:29.000 --> 05:56:31.080
I thought she is coming up.

05:56:31.080 --> 05:56:31.560
Oh my god.

05:56:32.120 --> 05:56:33.320
At the Ura.

05:56:33.320 --> 05:56:34.440
Please spell correctly.

05:56:35.960 --> 05:56:36.600
There she is.

05:56:38.200 --> 05:56:39.720
There she is.

05:56:39.720 --> 05:56:42.040
Oh literally in T minus two minutes.

05:56:42.760 --> 05:56:47.400
Um Azura is playing a absolutely precious game called Shrey.

05:56:47.400 --> 05:56:52.120
I have not yet had the pleasure to play it but it looks bloody good yeah.

05:56:53.160 --> 05:57:00.760
Yeah if you've made the 1000 wins it would have been a too much game.

05:57:01.640 --> 05:57:04.600
Listen to Strony Yat while at work and produce product to me.

05:57:04.600 --> 05:57:13.320
I feel like I'm like um uh I feel like I would distract being like at work and stuff.

05:57:15.400 --> 05:57:20.760
Honestly honestly if I had an office I feel like I'd be like one of them

05:57:20.760 --> 05:57:24.120
bosses that couldn't just give her rats arms.

05:57:24.120 --> 05:57:28.920
I'm like as long as you do the work go home early doesn't bother me none.

05:57:31.000 --> 05:57:36.200
Seems like whenever someone gets a manager type job they think they call the shots and it was like

05:57:36.200 --> 05:57:38.120
no you're at the mercy of your workers.

05:57:38.680 --> 05:57:40.120
Let's let's not get it twisted.

05:57:41.000 --> 05:57:42.200
Let's not get it twisted.

05:57:44.360 --> 05:57:45.800
Are you doing Marshmallow later?

05:57:45.800 --> 05:57:48.040
Yeah of course I'll do Marshmallow more than happy to.

05:57:48.920 --> 05:57:53.800
I would I'll do it when we do when we go back to the fish because unfortunately the

05:57:53.800 --> 05:58:00.200
wanes require a lot more um like fast clicking.

05:58:01.000 --> 05:58:06.440
Every time I move to the left I need to too and I'm I'm getting nervous.

05:58:06.440 --> 05:58:14.520
Now not to be a minger but when I tried to go to toilet but nothing came out and I'm worried

05:58:14.520 --> 05:58:17.960
I'm gonna have to go toilet in the middle of the stream but I don't want to go toilet.

05:58:21.400 --> 05:58:26.360
I normally take a shower after I I don't I don't.

05:58:28.680 --> 05:58:31.160
Felt oh my most what time's come in here.

05:58:32.200 --> 05:58:35.720
Oops but yes I will do Marshmallow it's not problem.

05:58:38.200 --> 05:58:40.600
Use your gamer bucket please do not ever type again.

05:58:41.160 --> 05:58:43.320
Gamer bucket.

05:58:43.320 --> 05:58:45.560
Now pee bottles I can tolerate.

05:58:46.440 --> 05:58:49.320
Gamer bucket like Eric Cartman style.

05:58:49.880 --> 05:58:52.440
Ma'am ma'am I need to use the bathroom.

05:58:56.760 --> 05:58:58.280
You gotta go for a job eh.

05:59:00.040 --> 05:59:01.320
The birthing girl.

05:59:01.320 --> 05:59:06.440
My team leader in quality assurance didn't solve their their premiums since months because

05:59:06.440 --> 05:59:09.320
the workers are motivated and didn't get trained properly.

05:59:09.400 --> 05:59:16.200
Literally just because you in the manager position does not make you a leader.

05:59:18.360 --> 05:59:22.440
Magi playing RuneScape into N.E.24 without uh

05:59:25.000 --> 05:59:27.960
refunds you know

05:59:31.800 --> 05:59:32.920
the gamer bucket.

05:59:40.280 --> 05:59:45.480
On a scale of 1 to 10 how jealous are you of men's ability to use gamer ball?

05:59:50.840 --> 05:59:57.720
I don't think it applies to me because I have acidic like main stinks.

05:59:59.560 --> 06:00:01.720
Actually I probably should have mentioned that to the doctor.

06:00:02.920 --> 06:00:05.320
Eep forgot to mention it what was that?

06:00:05.320 --> 06:00:08.840
Also if you try to do a fast knight named Fletch and your wrist would die after a few

06:00:08.840 --> 06:00:10.520
minutes unless you learned mouse pee.

06:00:11.400 --> 06:00:14.760
I don't have that kind of mouse I have up and down on the mouse that's it.

06:00:18.840 --> 06:00:21.480
Good dinner ruined sorry.

06:00:23.960 --> 06:00:30.840
Sorry okay I think we're gonna have to swap back to the swordfish just for a little bit

06:00:30.840 --> 06:00:33.560
because this is like one after the other.

06:00:34.520 --> 06:00:41.560
Your face your face melts off kind of acid yeah mouse keys are button presses.

06:00:50.200 --> 06:00:55.240
However we just bought the levels and I'll just commentate over oh my god you leveled up congrats.

06:00:56.440 --> 06:00:58.440
I'm kidding by the way we're not bought.

06:00:59.320 --> 06:01:04.120
I don't know how bad the bots are in runescape I heard they're really bad in world of warcraft

06:01:05.400 --> 06:01:12.200
but bots apparently keep prices low in cheeky runescape so I'm not really sure.

06:01:14.600 --> 06:01:17.480
Gamer girl uses pee bollies more a lot.

06:01:18.600 --> 06:01:21.560
Oh I'm already in trouble by youtube actually I should check that.

06:01:22.120 --> 06:01:25.080
Wait no I'll check it when we're doing the fish.

06:01:25.080 --> 06:01:28.280
Not while fest is banning the ways.

06:01:28.280 --> 06:01:32.680
I will check it after I've done this batch of wines.

06:01:41.960 --> 06:01:44.840
Oh yeah it's really bad and wow all versions.

06:01:46.120 --> 06:01:50.280
I just know some people say like oh the reason why the bots are actually good is because they

06:01:50.280 --> 06:01:55.640
keep everything low price because they're like trying to fight over the same resources type thing.

06:01:57.880 --> 06:02:00.920
And I was like honestly that is actually valid feedback.

06:02:01.800 --> 06:02:08.120
Right we'll go down to 5000 water and then I'm gonna swap to fish just to like use up all the

06:02:08.120 --> 06:02:15.160
fish because it's just in there and I'll read some marshmallow q&a's if you want to say something.

06:02:15.960 --> 06:02:29.400
Sorry I know I'm not doing that in a good way but there are bots that kill some of the

06:02:29.400 --> 06:02:32.600
hardest bosses in the game in the tens of thousands.

06:02:36.440 --> 06:02:39.400
Yeah bots keep runescape economy from high for inflating.

06:02:40.280 --> 06:02:48.280
I can't believe it. Capitalism wins again even in my video games and I can't escape.

06:02:50.120 --> 06:02:55.560
Didn't they just catch some bots and wow by placing a single row?

06:02:55.560 --> 06:02:58.040
Oh wait I seem to remember something like that.

06:02:59.160 --> 06:02:59.960
I think you're right.

06:03:01.720 --> 06:03:05.400
Also just gold farmers who aren't bots they just sell the money later on.

06:03:05.400 --> 06:03:13.400
Oh yeah you can like buy like in-game currency with like actual money so like you get given the

06:03:13.400 --> 06:03:20.760
money or something. Because of the there's like a Venezuelan meme so the Venezuelan

06:03:22.200 --> 06:03:32.200
Venezuelan economy went to shambles and basically it became profitable for

06:03:33.000 --> 06:03:39.800
those individuals to play runescape and sell the in-game currency or something.

06:03:39.800 --> 06:03:43.720
Yeah my brain's like kind of remembering that. They sell it on a third party site for

06:03:43.720 --> 06:03:52.600
anyone who's like hmm which is against T.O.S. oh okay okay okay I don't know okay I guess it's

06:03:52.600 --> 06:03:58.040
against T.O.S. on World of Warcraft as well then with that watch it. That could be wrong I don't know.

06:03:58.440 --> 06:04:05.240
Azura has gone live okay if there's any bleeding hearts or any

06:04:05.240 --> 06:04:11.240
reeflings who are needing a break from the winemaking. Azura Dooley has gone live.

06:04:11.240 --> 06:04:22.360
She is playing a game called Stray and she's a cat and I'm not a goat so if you want to see

06:04:22.360 --> 06:04:36.760
Neko Azura you know where to go. Mods I give you permission and thank you for linking my gen mates

06:04:36.760 --> 06:04:49.560
when they go live because we love my gen mates. I think Azura might actually hit 4k you know

06:04:49.560 --> 06:04:54.760
that I think she's about to teeter over 4k. She's teetering whilst I am on her

06:04:54.760 --> 06:04:59.160
tittering this thank you I'll be here all week that's absolutely awful I'm not I was going to

06:04:59.160 --> 06:05:05.000
repeat it in order to do that brimps but no that was absolutely awful and I should be ashamed of myself

06:05:05.240 --> 06:05:06.440
truly.

06:05:15.400 --> 06:05:24.280
Yeah she's at 4k oh that's fantastic. Soon Ace will be 4k as well and

06:05:26.680 --> 06:05:31.800
I'll get her to make some more adorable little shorts and I'll put some money in it and then

06:05:31.800 --> 06:05:38.920
she can celebrate her 4k as well. Gen mate love. Gen mate love.

06:05:47.240 --> 06:05:52.200
Oh no this has put me to sleep this is a terrible idea my room's getting nice and warm and

06:05:52.200 --> 06:05:57.480
runescape's so soothing and the reeflings in the back are so hypnotic hold on a minute

sleepiness but I'm getting hit with a wave of sleepiness I'm sure she's the other I put the

06:08:29.560 --> 06:08:37.400
heating on I have made a greatest error ever I'm not gonna make it I'm funny oh yeah that's

06:08:37.400 --> 06:08:42.280

06:09:52.040 --> 06:09:58.040
out with it I actually freaked out my gran one time I had a sleepover at her house and apparently

06:09:58.040 --> 06:10:08.840
like I sat up really quickly and and my eyes were like wide open she said but I didn't remember

06:10:08.840 --> 06:10:14.360
any of it and and when I woke up I was like I don't know why I'm so tired because I felt like

06:10:14.360 --> 06:10:22.120
I slept really well because when I have sleepover my gran we just shared the bed and she was like

06:10:22.120 --> 06:10:27.480
strongy you were sleep like you sat up and you're it's not sleep it's a sleepwalking if you don't

06:10:27.480 --> 06:10:36.280

06:10:47.240 --> 06:10:52.200

06:10:52.200 --> 06:10:57.400
you're awake but you're asleep okay the walking is just more obvious version okay we're learning

06:10:57.960 --> 06:11:02.600
well then they'll judge you while you sleep and when you wake up it'll be rooflings only yeah

06:11:03.720 --> 06:11:08.600

06:12:14.520 --> 06:12:20.920
I've had people explain it to me I've never had it in my entire life they say it's when

06:12:21.880 --> 06:12:28.040
your body is still asleep but you wake up in your mind but because you're in a certain phase of

06:12:28.040 --> 06:12:33.480
sleep things become really scary um and like you realize that you're paralyzed and stuff

06:12:36.680 --> 06:12:45.320
um so it's rough oh I shouldn't have put the heating on I'm going in again

06:14:17.320 --> 06:14:18.120
hmm

06:14:21.000 --> 06:14:25.960
being aquatic creatures do we reef flings when you need to be moisturized asking for

06:14:25.960 --> 06:14:30.040
a really important time to pick a question I don't know I feel like we just kind of like

06:14:30.040 --> 06:14:34.680
hydrate instantly when we enter the water again like we're fine to be out of the water but it's

06:14:34.680 --> 06:14:38.360
just where we are the incoming

06:14:38.920 --> 06:14:48.680
the incoming pregnancy is more in lore about how you gave us the girls really gets the

06:14:51.000 --> 06:14:56.200
enjoyer in me going but are we going to get a dedicated audio for it I like how vealour felt

06:14:56.200 --> 06:15:07.400
like our breath of fresh air both in industry and in my roster of each of us love me oh yeah

06:15:07.400 --> 06:15:13.880
no I can probably do an audio base around that um it's not a problem at all I'd just be like

06:15:14.520 --> 06:15:22.760
give me five babies no more no less that's all I asked I wrote a little thing on my alternative

06:15:22.760 --> 06:15:29.800
twitter only 59k winds to go brah brah

06:15:30.360 --> 06:15:38.280
I'm I'm touching my tentacles and right now I do it out of principle but if I ain't even

06:15:38.280 --> 06:15:40.200
saying anything that's like good

06:15:44.920 --> 06:15:51.960
uh hold on I need to read this one um hi strongy a few things I wanted to say and ask most of the

06:15:51.960 --> 06:15:56.600
questions are for later than the line so feel free to disregard them if you need to be

06:15:57.480 --> 06:16:04.840
uh first I wanted to say you and other girls really helped keep me sane last week it was tough

06:16:04.840 --> 06:16:09.400
but you made it through oh that's fantastic congrats I don't know if you're a riefling so I won't call

06:16:09.400 --> 06:16:21.160
you riefling um would you ever consider opening a PO box I am so sorry however um I've discouraged

06:16:21.160 --> 06:16:31.400
all girls uh from a PO box opening due to the fact that um air trackers are I think no I'm not

06:16:31.400 --> 06:16:36.840
accusing you of putting an air tracker in it or anything like that uh the safety reasons just

06:16:36.840 --> 06:16:44.840
completely outweigh the fund that could be in a PO box I do apologize what is a box a PO box is

06:16:44.840 --> 06:16:51.400
like a setup location where you can send packages and and I would go retrieve them but for safety

06:16:51.400 --> 06:16:57.320
reasons I can't have any of that so I am so sorry but thank you for being interested in sending us

06:16:57.320 --> 06:17:04.040
stuff um have you ever considered making a music playlist of your fave songs so rieflings can listen

06:17:04.040 --> 06:17:12.600
to offline um if you thought something you guys won yeah my current song that I'm addicted to

06:17:12.840 --> 06:17:19.160
is by Eust who's Dutch and the song goes

06:17:29.960 --> 06:17:36.200

comments you made and stream about your butt today I need you to sound me and leave an imprint on my

06:19:54.760 --> 06:20:01.560
face I don't think you'd be able to breathe the darlin I think you'd I think you'd need to tap out

06:20:01.560 --> 06:20:09.800
so I can you know stand up and not suffocate you all right we'll do it in the ASMR but how about that

06:20:10.600 --> 06:20:17.960

after it you like get a special prize or something sacrifices mama

06:20:33.320 --> 06:20:37.320
hey stroney you said gen 2 is cooking does that mean we don't have a chance and there won't be

06:20:37.320 --> 06:20:46.920
additions oh no sorry uh no when I say gen 2 is cooking it took a year for concept art model

06:20:47.720 --> 06:20:55.400
assets emotes all of that it takes a year to do that kind of stuff we're at the stage of going

06:20:55.400 --> 06:21:02.200
all the way back to the start all the way back to one paragraph about this girl all the way back to

06:21:02.200 --> 06:21:08.040
right what are the names all the way back like we're all the way back there so please don't there's

06:21:08.040 --> 06:21:19.880
no one um I said in the exposing veiler stream no one got a call back um there is no call back

06:21:20.920 --> 06:21:30.680
there is no mean um take off your clothes gen 2 is ban here no it is um we're all the way back

06:21:30.680 --> 06:21:39.400
thankfully I am not on the heavier side of um development when it comes to names or whatever

06:21:39.400 --> 06:21:45.240
but it's like we're now going all the way back um especially like the lower art I need to think

06:21:45.240 --> 06:21:55.000
of the story and uh but that's what I mean when I say we're all the way back to gen 2 um

06:21:55.800 --> 06:22:02.520
uh or did you just mean characters then and models and niches and such yes that's what I meant sorry

06:22:02.520 --> 06:22:11.480
just uh scare you no I will it'll be the exact same pro there's no date there's no date um which

06:22:11.480 --> 06:22:16.920
I'm so freaking glad there's no date because making a deadline is horrible and I don't ever want to

06:22:16.920 --> 06:22:24.440
have a deadline like that again um the announcements for that kind of stuff only will come out when

06:22:24.440 --> 06:22:33.640
things are ready and uh as I said the generation one will be up for a year before gen 2 even like

06:22:35.000 --> 06:22:40.520
yeah it'll be at least a year like after do you know I mean I don't know if that means something

06:22:40.520 --> 06:22:45.960
good night I'ma turn in please rest well sorry I'm a star too busy rambling sleep well those of you

06:22:45.960 --> 06:22:54.680
who need to sleep um but yes uh it's it took a year for development it is not quick it's not easy

06:22:54.680 --> 06:22:58.920
it's not fast um and especially when you've got artists that love to go over deadlines um

06:23:01.640 --> 06:23:07.320
it makes everything an absolute nightmare um I kind of said a wee bit of it on the

06:23:07.320 --> 06:23:14.840
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood stream I had planned everything to occur within certain months

06:23:15.640 --> 06:23:22.760
and then everything went to because artists all unanimously went over deadlines so if you're

06:23:22.760 --> 06:23:29.000
an artist that works with us look I'm not mad at you everyone did it so you know you know it's fine

06:23:29.720 --> 06:23:40.120
but uh everyone went over and it made everything happen in May when May was supposed to be

06:23:40.120 --> 06:23:45.480
where I fully focused on getting stuff done for the girls and like we're still kind of picking up

06:23:45.480 --> 06:23:50.120
the pieces like I'm doing stuff I shouldn't really have shouldn't be doing at the stage

06:23:50.120 --> 06:23:56.040
like it was supposed to be handed off or there's supposed to be something else in place um but it

06:23:56.040 --> 06:24:06.680
just uh nightmare nightmare how many marshmallows do you have 850 on the dot actually 850 um

06:24:10.040 --> 06:24:18.120
yes I don't even know how I got on that rant hey I still have two ideas for a gen two

06:24:18.120 --> 06:24:23.960
what would you want to tell us which one two things that I think would be popular a lollipop dragon

06:24:24.120 --> 06:24:31.240
there's no lollipop dragon vtuber's curious to get to do it after the pandora on anything

06:24:32.040 --> 06:24:39.640
also I think an insect girl in the style of a traditional japanese geisha who uses her own

06:24:39.640 --> 06:24:44.600
self to make her clothes be popular that's unique I've not heard that not a bad idea

06:24:49.240 --> 06:24:52.840
uh I think I need a jobby

06:24:55.320 --> 06:24:59.640
I think I need a mute and go hold on it makes me still mix going

06:25:01.640 --> 06:25:07.320
hold on a minute refund uh i've a hydrate and then I'm gonna go for a few minutes

06:25:10.360 --> 06:25:15.160

my other bottle of water to hydrate you need hydrate to make it come out like easy

06:25:22.920 --> 06:25:26.840

06:25:31.800 --> 06:25:37.640
I'm so sorry I can like feel my my my bills shifting about it and I'm like I don't

06:25:40.600 --> 06:25:47.080

06:29:05.160 --> 06:29:33.500
Are you squiddling me right now?

06:30:33.500 --> 06:30:44.220
There was no loaf of bread to be had, but I took it again.

06:30:44.220 --> 06:30:49.660
I'm also ovulating like crazy, just thought you should know.

06:30:50.160 --> 06:30:55.160
Bro, the amount of ink that just came out of me, holy shit.

06:30:59.160 --> 06:31:03.160
So I don't mind talking about this because I've got hands on chicks.

06:31:03.160 --> 06:31:11.160
When whammin' ovulate, you get a clear ink that comes out of you, produced naturally.

06:31:11.160 --> 06:31:14.160
And I just had that and I was like, what?

06:31:14.660 --> 06:31:21.660
So I'm like, well, now's the best time to send any bibbutes.

06:31:21.660 --> 06:31:32.160
I had no idea, but that makes sense why I'm tired because I just want, you know, my body wants one thing.

06:31:32.160 --> 06:31:42.160
I have over 2,000 burnt pork, bitch, that was so cool.

06:31:42.160 --> 06:31:44.160
Good to know.

06:31:44.160 --> 06:31:46.160
That made my neurons burn.

06:31:46.160 --> 06:31:48.160
Bro, I wish I could have shown you that, honestly.

06:31:48.160 --> 06:31:50.160
I was like, what, an error?

06:31:51.160 --> 06:32:05.160
Yes, I don't know what's happening with my butt though.

06:32:05.160 --> 06:32:10.160
I need to go number two, but nothing's happening.

06:32:10.160 --> 06:32:12.160
You like receiving bibbutes?

06:32:12.160 --> 06:32:16.160
Go, go.

06:32:16.160 --> 06:32:19.160
I am down atrocious, I volunteer.

06:32:19.160 --> 06:32:21.160
Hey guys, do you want to make Gen 2 right now?

06:32:21.160 --> 06:32:23.160
I'm ovulating.

06:32:23.160 --> 06:32:27.160
Oh my god, we can just say that every time I ovulate, I'll be like, Gen 2.

06:32:27.160 --> 06:32:29.160
Come on.

06:32:29.160 --> 06:32:31.160
Oh, good to know.

06:32:34.160 --> 06:32:37.160
Humans are just monkeys with fanfare shoes though.

06:32:37.160 --> 06:32:39.160
Oh, thoughts.

06:32:39.160 --> 06:32:41.160
Not quite, close enough.

06:32:41.160 --> 06:32:44.160
But a few more evolutionary factors in there.

06:32:44.160 --> 06:32:50.160
Multiply, refling, produce, feature, activity.

06:32:50.160 --> 06:32:54.160
Sorry, I'm stuttering.

06:32:54.160 --> 06:32:57.160
Well, we have over 200 volunteers.

06:32:57.160 --> 06:33:00.160
Hi, volunteers.

06:33:00.160 --> 06:33:04.160
We did it, we're in the, we're in a million XP.

06:33:04.160 --> 06:33:06.160
God, wines are so fast.

06:33:06.160 --> 06:33:11.160
We were, I don't even think we were like, I don't even know what we were at the start of the stream.

06:33:11.160 --> 06:33:15.160
But we're already a million XP, that's fantastic.

06:33:15.160 --> 06:33:21.160
Seriously, we're making, I think the wines really is the vehicle.

06:33:23.160 --> 06:33:25.160
Aw, someone said, thank you for existing.

06:33:25.160 --> 06:33:27.160
You're so awesome, refling.

06:33:27.160 --> 06:33:29.160
Thank you for existing.

06:33:30.160 --> 06:33:32.160
Uh...

06:33:39.160 --> 06:33:43.160
Oh, I don't know, I kind of...

06:33:43.160 --> 06:33:48.160
Someone is currently anonymously editing for the girls, but they don't want any credit.

06:33:48.160 --> 06:33:50.160
But we are gonna upload the videos.

06:33:50.160 --> 06:33:52.160
You don't need to apologize for not subtitling it.

06:33:52.160 --> 06:33:54.160
Subtitling, don't take long on.

06:33:54.160 --> 06:33:56.160
The videos are like, three minutes long.

06:33:57.160 --> 06:34:03.160
So, are the Gen 1 models quintuplets?

06:34:03.160 --> 06:34:09.160
I like to joke that I had the girls in my stomach for like, how long?

06:34:09.160 --> 06:34:10.160
12 months?

06:34:10.160 --> 06:34:13.160
Yeah, I guess 12 months on the dot.

06:34:13.160 --> 06:34:15.160
Nearly there, 5.98.

06:34:15.160 --> 06:34:17.160
Oh my god, I owe you guys so much.

06:34:17.160 --> 06:34:20.160
There's some more videos, I'm not even uploaded the first one.

06:34:21.160 --> 06:34:31.160
Um, I think I'm gonna be too tired after stream though, to edit and upload the first one.

06:34:33.160 --> 06:34:38.160
Oh my god, problems of being an overachiever for the male.

06:34:38.160 --> 06:34:43.160
Have you ever played Metal Gear Solid?

06:34:43.160 --> 06:34:46.160
I don't think I've played it, but I've definitely heard of it.

06:34:47.160 --> 06:34:50.160
Game suggestions, Mad Rat Dead.

06:34:50.160 --> 06:34:53.160
It's a rhythm platform game on Nintendo.

06:34:53.160 --> 06:34:54.160
How odd.

06:34:54.160 --> 06:34:57.160
Creeps, it's a puzzle game with a rare art style.

06:34:57.160 --> 06:35:01.160
The storyline is decent and you can use it to interact with chat if you get stuck.

06:35:01.160 --> 06:35:04.160
I do it like when chat holds my hand through game.

06:35:04.160 --> 06:35:07.160
Uh, how'd you mention SteelSeries during the collab?

06:35:07.160 --> 06:35:09.160
Hopefully it works well for you.

06:35:09.160 --> 06:35:15.160
No, whenever Azura talks to me, I don't know if the other girls can hear Azura.

06:35:15.160 --> 06:35:21.160
Whenever Azura talks to me via Discord, her make always cuts out and can't handle her.

06:35:21.160 --> 06:35:24.160
And I'm like, Azura, get that noise gate off.

06:35:24.160 --> 06:35:26.160
And she's like, I've not got anything on.

06:35:26.160 --> 06:35:29.160
And I'm like, what is, like, what's, what's she's in?

06:35:29.160 --> 06:35:32.160
Cause I can never hear her, I think the other girls can hear her.

06:35:34.160 --> 06:35:38.160
But I can never hear her when we like have a collab on Discord or anything.

06:35:38.160 --> 06:35:42.160
And when she gets excited, it cuts into her even more.

06:35:42.160 --> 06:35:46.160
But I don't know if she has, like, Discord filters on maybe.

06:35:46.160 --> 06:35:49.160
Which is why I'm like, ah, Azura, are you in that SteelSeries?

06:35:49.160 --> 06:35:52.160
Cause I've said to her a few times now, but I'm not annoyed or anything.

06:35:52.160 --> 06:35:55.160
It's more like a meme where I'm like, ah, SteelSeries.

06:35:55.160 --> 06:36:00.160
And someone has sent me a cat box, should it open up?

06:36:00.160 --> 06:36:02.160
Fuck it, I'm feeling risky.

06:36:02.160 --> 06:36:04.160
What is it? It's a picture.

06:36:04.160 --> 06:36:06.160
Whoa! Okay!

06:36:06.160 --> 06:36:09.160
Yep, that's the picture, alright.

06:36:12.160 --> 06:36:16.160
Okay, I'm not, I'm not gonna open up any cat books.

06:36:16.160 --> 06:36:18.160
Uh, links.

06:36:18.160 --> 06:36:20.160
On, while I'm here.

06:36:24.160 --> 06:36:26.160
Okay!

06:36:26.160 --> 06:36:28.160
Okay, Swordfish.

06:36:28.160 --> 06:36:30.160
Swordfish, yes.

06:36:30.160 --> 06:36:32.160
Um...

06:36:32.160 --> 06:36:34.160
Blumow.

06:36:34.160 --> 06:36:36.160
Share it with a class male.

06:36:38.160 --> 06:36:40.160
I, uh, cuddle.

06:36:40.160 --> 06:36:42.160
Are you okay with me using soul smagment?

06:36:42.160 --> 06:36:44.160
Smagment, oh my god.

06:36:44.160 --> 06:36:46.160
I've got cocks on my mind, what the fuck.

06:36:46.160 --> 06:36:50.160
Soul, small segment of the clapping audio for a meme.

06:36:50.160 --> 06:36:52.160
Yeah, sure, if so, would you rather wait?

06:36:52.160 --> 06:36:54.160
Now, um, now you can post it, it's fine, honestly.

06:36:54.160 --> 06:36:57.160
It's cause it's, cause it's gonna be publicly posted.

06:36:57.160 --> 06:37:00.160
It's not, it's not really an issue to make any of the content a meme.

06:37:00.160 --> 06:37:02.160
I'm so sorry, ah, ah, frickin.

06:37:02.160 --> 06:37:06.160
That was, that would poke your eye out, that's all I'm saying.

06:37:06.160 --> 06:37:08.160
That's all I'm gonna leave out, that would poke your eye out.

06:37:08.160 --> 06:37:10.160
Um...

06:37:10.160 --> 06:37:14.160
Oh, she's so damn bad, just like us, real, real.

06:37:14.160 --> 06:37:16.160
Keep being that lovable goofy gibber you are.

06:37:16.160 --> 06:37:18.160
Oh, thank you, Reefling.

06:37:18.160 --> 06:37:20.160
Strony!

06:37:20.160 --> 06:37:22.160
Reefling!

06:37:22.160 --> 06:37:24.160
I listened to the girlfriend begs the whole day tomorrow.

06:37:24.160 --> 06:37:28.160
I remembered you apologizing about no editing as much.

06:37:28.160 --> 06:37:32.160
I think, at least in this case, less editing of mistakes added to the quality.

06:37:32.160 --> 06:37:35.160
I'm so frickin glad you agree, Reefling.

06:37:35.160 --> 06:37:41.160
I have been enjoying, like, not doing scripted stuff and tryharding.

06:37:41.160 --> 06:37:43.160
Um...

06:37:43.160 --> 06:37:45.160
Um...

06:37:45.160 --> 06:37:49.160
Like, I have been enjoying recording ASMR.

06:37:49.160 --> 06:37:53.160
That isn't scripted, and I'm doing it off the top of my head.

06:37:53.160 --> 06:37:54.160
Wait, wait, what do you say?

06:37:54.160 --> 06:37:56.160
There was one part where you seemed to accidentally say,

06:37:56.160 --> 06:38:00.160
let me hold your fireman, then wait, let me hold your hose, Mr. Fireman.

06:38:00.160 --> 06:38:03.160
It felt so natural, cause of how frantic you were becoming.

06:38:03.160 --> 06:38:06.160
Yeah, because I did it all off the top of my head.

06:38:06.160 --> 06:38:08.160
Um...

06:38:08.160 --> 06:38:10.160
I don't know if it was scripted, but you also yawned at one point.

06:38:10.160 --> 06:38:12.160
If it was intentional or ad-lib, it was so natural.

06:38:12.160 --> 06:38:18.160
No, I've been enjoying doing, like, non-hyper-edited, super production of the wazoo.

06:38:18.160 --> 06:38:20.160
I've been enjoying doing, like, such casual...

06:38:20.160 --> 06:38:22.160
Um, it's been so lovely.

06:38:22.160 --> 06:38:24.160
I've been enjoying it thoroughly.

06:38:24.160 --> 06:38:27.160
I really hope you enjoy the first, like, thank you for 1000 subs,

06:38:27.160 --> 06:38:29.160
cause it's just me, me-man.

06:38:29.160 --> 06:38:31.160
Um...

06:38:31.160 --> 06:38:33.160
From work! Ayyy!

06:38:34.160 --> 06:38:36.160
Okay, but how many strongy-hands big was it?

06:38:36.160 --> 06:38:38.160
I mean...

06:38:38.160 --> 06:38:41.160
There wasn't a ruler in the picture, but...

06:38:42.160 --> 06:38:46.160
From the glance I got before I closed it, it was pretty...

06:38:46.160 --> 06:38:48.160
3D knee...

06:38:50.160 --> 06:38:52.160
I laughed so much in that part, aww.

06:38:53.160 --> 06:38:55.160
I don't know if it was scripted or not, but you...

06:38:55.160 --> 06:38:56.160
Or I'll say that...

06:38:56.160 --> 06:38:59.160
If any of it was scripted, that kind of reinforces my point.

06:38:59.160 --> 06:39:03.480
points so much of the audio scripted are not felt natural even the mistakes seemed no no that

06:39:03.480 --> 06:39:09.960
that was just me that's just me being unable to read uh unable to read unable to formulate my

06:39:09.960 --> 06:39:14.840
my thoughts into our proper sentence structure uh i know it was just the meme but it was really fun

06:39:14.840 --> 06:39:20.280
and good i think it would be neat to do the natural style more i i freaking agree i 100%

06:39:20.280 --> 06:39:36.840
i'm doing natural style open natural style as i said we're gonna finish cooking all the swordfish

06:39:36.840 --> 06:39:47.480
and then we'll go back to wine just because wine is so demanding um if you want to help hold the

06:39:47.480 --> 06:39:52.760
hose during a number one does that mean i get to hold you up when you go number one brah i would

06:39:52.760 --> 06:40:02.440
go everywhere if you did that um straw night i felt it's imperative to let you know there's a

06:40:02.440 --> 06:40:10.680
fortnite skin called tropical punch zoe that looks shockingly like you i swear to god if i look like

06:40:10.680 --> 06:40:25.240
a fortnite character if i look like a fortnite uh i can i can cane to see i know what you mean

06:40:25.240 --> 06:40:34.040
with the bows on our head i get it yeah i get it no that's not bad thankfully i don't look too much

06:40:34.040 --> 06:40:46.280
like but i get it would only need to ask once to hold by the way the subtitles were actually fun

06:40:47.320 --> 06:40:53.560
but why didn't you make someone else do them well when i do all that stuff there's like

06:40:54.280 --> 06:40:59.720
no subtitling takes so much time like it's it's just such a waste of money as well because not

06:40:59.800 --> 06:41:07.640
everyone reads the files um until like outsource that work even further is just like oh i'd rather

06:41:07.640 --> 06:41:12.120
just save the money and like spend it on the girls type thing because i could have sent that to an

06:41:12.120 --> 06:41:18.040
editor and i could have sent that to a video like renderer type thing it's just like i'll just do it

06:41:18.040 --> 06:41:19.960
myself you know

06:41:25.640 --> 06:41:31.160

06:43:31.560 --> 06:43:33.080

06:43:53.240 --> 06:43:55.000
no and do you even want to

06:44:00.120 --> 06:44:00.520

the only i wouldn't put um ai content like monetize it i don't think that's right i don't

06:44:12.280 --> 06:44:21.160
mind like ai memes of myself or something like that like that's funny um but like actually ai

06:44:21.160 --> 06:44:26.440
content like i wouldn't use ai content on a thumbnail and then earn money from it like i don't think

06:44:27.400 --> 06:44:32.440
i don't think that's very nice because as a content creator like someone can literally you

06:44:32.440 --> 06:44:36.920
know yank your voice and then make money off of it and it was like well why would i do the same

06:44:37.560 --> 06:44:44.760
to someone else like that's not nice you know can you hold it do you think you can handle

06:44:47.480 --> 06:44:53.720
um have you considered trading a chat box from your stream absolutely not are you kidding me that

06:44:53.720 --> 06:44:58.200
all that thing we'll see is use the other hole refling other hole other hole other hole

06:44:59.240 --> 06:45:01.160
that all that chat box is gonna say

06:45:04.520 --> 06:45:09.000
i don't really use marshmallow marshmallow very often if someone wanted to send you a

06:45:09.000 --> 06:45:16.440
bit but how it says oh you do what's called a cat box link and then you send me the link

06:45:16.440 --> 06:45:21.160
and then i look at the link and the rest is history

06:45:28.840 --> 06:45:33.960
asmr booth hypnoscript i've already recorded the asmr booth

06:45:35.240 --> 06:45:45.400

06:49:21.800 --> 06:49:27.640

06:49:27.640 --> 06:49:35.240
refling and bypass the filters have you thought of more games you can play in stream snipes with

06:49:35.240 --> 06:49:40.920

pinpril in and we're gonna try our best to be able to um but he's joining what if you

06:59:38.840 --> 06:59:45.880
want to get comfy in bed and then get oh my god you seen that meme that's like when your sush was

06:59:45.880 --> 06:59:56.120
that when your sushi roll is sad and just take your sushi roll and put her down and base script

06:59:56.120 --> 07:00:01.240
Albre of the script quality is gonna like go up dramatically after the three month mark

07:00:01.240 --> 07:00:07.100
You're gonna know when the script master came into play because you can tell it's like not me writing that shiz anymore

You're like oh god finally strong. He's not doing it anymore. I

07:00:11.500 --> 07:00:14.180
Say that as if I'm not writing all my own stuff

07:00:14.180 --> 07:00:20.420
But I want to write my own stuff because I'm passionate about it not to say that script master isn't passionate

07:00:20.420 --> 07:00:25.780
But I quite like writing my stuff because it feels it feels more intimate when I can like do it between

07:00:26.120 --> 07:00:32.400
Me and we fling, you know, we do it together and I have you in mind. You are my muse we fling. You are my muse and

Sometimes it's nice being a little bro. Well little bros are for a zero big bros and me

07:00:56.960 --> 07:00:58.960

07:00:59.360 --> 07:01:02.800
Yours are exceptionally good. Oh, that's very kind. I I like

07:01:02.800 --> 07:01:07.520
Um, I did have the option to hand over my scripts to someone else

07:01:07.520 --> 07:01:13.680
But I I like doing it between us really need this fire making XP for real for real

07:01:15.560 --> 07:01:17.560
I

07:01:17.600 --> 07:01:25.600
Imagine you and the other girls write their own stuff. There was a hand full of girls who wanted to give their hand at it

07:01:25.840 --> 07:01:33.600
I absolutely did not expect it because um, it's just more time and I don't want the girls like stressing out over that kind of thing

07:01:36.800 --> 07:01:38.800
But yeah, I

07:01:41.480 --> 07:01:45.800
Just don't want to stress the girls out if they want to do it of their own violation

07:01:46.560 --> 07:01:50.840
We all listen and then that's perfect. Did I just hear?

07:01:56.360 --> 07:01:58.360
She's not happy a feather

07:02:00.360 --> 07:02:02.360

07:02:02.680 --> 07:02:08.340
Day 10 of eating celery daily is so bad. Oh, no, don't put yourself through celery for that

07:02:08.960 --> 07:02:17.880
Celery is nasty. I've never enjoyed it. I'm sorry. Doesn't matter how much like humus you put on it view a listen by a listen

07:02:18.400 --> 07:02:23.400
Did I just say it funny bullish in bullish in there's no I okay. We're getting there

07:02:24.000 --> 07:02:26.360
Stopped flusterers exactly

07:02:28.440 --> 07:02:30.440
He he oh my goodness

07:02:32.360 --> 07:02:34.480

07:02:35.680 --> 07:02:43.400
Yeah, I love your scripts on patreon strony. Thank you. I did them off the top of my head myself

07:02:45.120 --> 07:02:47.120
I

07:02:47.240 --> 07:02:52.480
Will be very curious to see what the doughnut song results in I have I

07:02:53.120 --> 07:02:55.920
Imagine the week after the doughnut song concludes

07:02:55.920 --> 07:03:00.800
I will be having very short streams so I can focus on the rewards one at a time

07:03:01.360 --> 07:03:08.000
And I know some agencies had a bit problems trying to handle streaming and getting rewards out

07:03:08.600 --> 07:03:10.600
obviously because I'm such an

07:03:11.120 --> 07:03:12.480
unbelievably

07:03:12.480 --> 07:03:19.560
Bad workaholic or good however you want it good for people who like content content content bad for the actual

07:03:20.720 --> 07:03:28.960
Workaholic themselves because they just non-stop keep going, but I think I definitely am in a position where I can get stuff out

07:03:29.960 --> 07:03:31.960
relatively quick

07:03:32.400 --> 07:03:34.880
Whether that be an audio a collab audio

07:03:37.240 --> 07:03:38.880
Yeah

07:03:38.880 --> 07:03:44.120
Maybe those are good if you want your money from birds. I have a huge backlog of willow logs from doing

07:03:45.960 --> 07:03:49.600
Short streams like 10 hours instead of 12. Mm-hmm

07:03:50.040 --> 07:03:57.360
For me a short stream is two hours, which I think someone said that's literally what the regular stream time is for the average

07:03:57.360 --> 07:03:59.360
Vtuber and I'm like

07:03:59.840 --> 07:04:03.560
Two hours is me like doing stuff in the background

07:04:03.560 --> 07:04:06.640
I'm not being funny like if I have it if you have

07:04:07.000 --> 07:04:10.440
If you look and you see I've done a two-hour stream and nothing else that day

07:04:10.440 --> 07:04:13.000
That means I am doing like so much work in the background

07:04:14.360 --> 07:04:15.800
type thing

07:04:15.800 --> 07:04:20.960
Is that these scrawny cuddles? There's only one of them in this world, baby

07:04:23.120 --> 07:04:28.760
Time to cook through my 3k swordfish literally that's what I'm doing just getting through it

07:04:30.240 --> 07:04:33.520
It takes her two hours just to start playing the game Lamal

07:04:37.200 --> 07:04:39.200
Management got me there hydration chick

07:04:42.640 --> 07:04:44.640
Wow

07:04:46.160 --> 07:04:48.880
Hi scrawny in the most loving way possible

07:04:48.880 --> 07:04:54.480
I want to bury my face in your butt until you pass out while you hmm yourself. You're too hot. Oh

07:04:56.320 --> 07:05:00.680
Just your gentle talk is enough to get me going sometimes when you talk about other hot things

07:05:00.680 --> 07:05:05.880
I need a moment to calm down. Oh my god, we've got me blushing shit

07:05:06.800 --> 07:05:08.800
Stop

07:05:08.800 --> 07:05:10.800
I'm glad I have that control of you

07:05:11.600 --> 07:05:13.600
That power

07:05:14.000 --> 07:05:16.000
Makes me very happy

07:05:16.640 --> 07:05:20.000
Um a bit too happy. I think I take a little bit too much

07:05:20.880 --> 07:05:24.720
Um pleasure from such a thing. Is that terrible?

07:05:29.440 --> 07:05:35.200
Sure do have powers to arrest the boot up. What is this a Windows 95? No because I won't stop yapping

07:05:37.280 --> 07:05:38.480
I

07:05:38.480 --> 07:05:42.320
Love to eat sushi. I could do it for hours. Oh, yeah

07:05:44.080 --> 07:05:46.080
Is that because I'm a cutlery?

07:05:47.760 --> 07:05:52.480
Oh, I keep wanting to freaking make that what does your oh she smell like meme

07:05:53.440 --> 07:05:55.040
because

07:05:55.040 --> 07:05:57.040
the reason is

07:05:59.040 --> 07:06:04.240
Uh, what's the reason oh because I use a lemon scented soap

07:06:04.640 --> 07:06:08.640
I wanted to post it and be like this call fish comes pre-seasoned

07:06:09.360 --> 07:06:12.560
Um, and then I think there's only one other girl that needs to do it

07:06:12.560 --> 07:06:14.960
And then everyone knows what the whole velour smells like

07:06:16.800 --> 07:06:18.800
Six thousand subscribers reached

07:06:19.840 --> 07:06:22.720
What we celebrated 5k

07:06:25.680 --> 07:06:27.680
Oh my gosh

07:06:34.480 --> 07:06:36.480
Ah

07:06:44.720 --> 07:06:48.640
What I'm really excited

07:07:01.120 --> 07:07:03.120
Why is it getting so cold

07:07:05.040 --> 07:07:07.040
I'm so confused. It shouldn't have been

07:07:08.720 --> 07:07:15.760
Let's statistically yeah, it should have only been pushed to 5k people. It's bizarre. I didn't expect that at all

07:07:19.600 --> 07:07:22.960
You have all the power over us. Take more

07:07:24.480 --> 07:07:26.480
Thank you for the tip

07:07:26.960 --> 07:07:28.960
rilke kadmus

07:07:29.360 --> 07:07:31.360
Any rilke kadmus

07:07:31.440 --> 07:07:38.560
Thank you for saying it. I'm so confused. I'm like daddy you make a tweet and be like I can't believe it but in under 24 hours

07:07:40.320 --> 07:07:43.040
The one thing I think I've mentioned this in another stream

07:07:44.000 --> 07:07:48.160
The one thing I do not like about being a vtuber in this context

07:07:48.800 --> 07:07:53.120
Is you have to play the numbered games and you have to play the

07:07:53.920 --> 07:07:55.920
Oh, thank you for this

07:07:57.920 --> 07:08:00.320
Um in terms of like milestones

07:08:01.680 --> 07:08:02.800
Ah

07:08:02.800 --> 07:08:07.680
And it's a hard one to navigate because if you don't say thank you thank you

07:08:08.720 --> 07:08:10.720
You look almost ungrateful

07:08:11.120 --> 07:08:12.640
But if you do

07:08:12.640 --> 07:08:19.360
Say thank you. Thank you. It looks like you're counting and waiting for the next milestone just so you can spam. Thank you. Thank you, you know

07:08:20.240 --> 07:08:21.520
and

07:08:21.520 --> 07:08:23.520
You don't have to say thank you

07:08:24.400 --> 07:08:27.760
Well, the problem is I'm trying to get like

07:08:28.720 --> 07:08:32.480
Gratisom 6k moment. Thank you little wifling. Um

07:08:33.600 --> 07:08:42.720
The thing is like it would be really good to get on vtuber news or any kind of source like that because it brings more attention to the girls in general

07:08:43.840 --> 07:08:45.840
which is why

07:08:45.840 --> 07:08:47.840
it's like

07:08:48.480 --> 07:08:50.480
I don't want people thinking i'm counting

07:08:50.640 --> 07:08:53.360
But what i'm thinking about is the probable

07:08:53.840 --> 07:09:00.240
Like the possibility that it could gain new eyes to the girls because I want nothing for them to succeed

07:09:00.480 --> 07:09:07.280
I've got everything I want right here. I've got my wiflings. We're freaking meman. We've got member streams. We've got multiplayer games

07:09:07.760 --> 07:09:10.000
Uh, we've got a smart the wazoo coming out

07:09:10.000 --> 07:09:15.360
I've got collabs of other vtubers that are willing to interact with me like I've got everything I need

07:09:15.840 --> 07:09:17.840
I'm so freaking happy

07:09:17.920 --> 07:09:21.440
I want the girls to achieve their dreams and the truth of

07:09:22.080 --> 07:09:25.680
Of them achieving their dreams is one to have enough money to be a content creator

07:09:26.160 --> 07:09:30.800
Some of them are looking to move out. Some of them are looking for upgrade equipments on their own. Um

07:09:32.080 --> 07:09:38.160
You know, um, emmy was fantastic. She's already designed her 2.0 model because it feels more like her

07:09:38.720 --> 07:09:39.760
um

07:09:39.760 --> 07:09:46.000
That kind of thing I want the girls to have it some of them wanted 3d models. I wanted them to get it and

07:09:46.960 --> 07:09:51.120
The truth of the matter is in order to get these things

07:09:51.920 --> 07:09:54.320
That there needs to be eyes on the girls

07:09:54.880 --> 07:09:58.640
Um, so I can help them achieve their 3d goals and stuff

07:09:59.040 --> 07:10:02.480
Although someone said that someone was like, what do you mean by the three year mark?

07:10:03.760 --> 07:10:06.640
When I whenever I mentioned the three year mark

07:10:08.080 --> 07:10:11.920
Congrats to whoever leveled up there whenever I mentioned the three year mark

07:10:12.880 --> 07:10:17.520
The reason I say three years is because statistically three years

07:10:18.080 --> 07:10:22.480
And you're done. You're you're persona. You're whatever you want to call it. It may be

07:10:23.600 --> 07:10:26.800
Oh my god, you really look like emmy as well in games. Uh

07:10:28.400 --> 07:10:30.080
The

07:10:30.080 --> 07:10:38.240
Reason why three years is this mysterious number placed on someone's head is because that statistically if you do find success

07:10:38.240 --> 07:10:45.600
By the third year the success goes unless you make you change your content up dramatically

07:10:46.720 --> 07:10:48.960
and the reason I say three years is because

07:10:50.800 --> 07:10:57.040
Remember before you like wait, so strong. He's only got three years relax. Stop doing relax. No

07:10:58.640 --> 07:11:08.160
No, that's not it's very possible that strongy and uh, like once we're all satisfied like I won't stop until you guys

07:11:08.320 --> 07:11:10.960
Are ready for me to stop like please don't no don't do

07:11:11.600 --> 07:11:17.600
But please don't think I'm like just gonna abruptly stop overnight. Like that's not the reality of the situation at all

07:11:19.040 --> 07:11:22.720
It's very likely I will want to focus on

07:11:23.520 --> 07:11:26.160
Hypnosis audio is like way down the line

07:11:26.720 --> 07:11:31.760
Um, it's over. No, so never no if you if you don't want me to go I'll be streaming in my little

07:11:32.480 --> 07:11:34.480
retirement home doing my thing

07:11:35.360 --> 07:11:37.040
um

07:11:37.040 --> 07:11:39.920
I've got an end in stamina like seriously this is

07:11:42.000 --> 07:11:49.280
Just it took so long to get here and everything worked out in the end and it just feels so nice to be

07:11:51.840 --> 07:11:53.840
I don't I just

07:11:54.400 --> 07:12:03.440
Like to be accepted to be um just having fun folk want to hang out. It's just casual. It's none of this like

07:12:04.560 --> 07:12:06.160
you know

07:12:06.240 --> 07:12:08.240
artsy fartsy like

07:12:08.640 --> 07:12:14.800
Oh, this vtuber is giggling their head off every two seconds. Um, this vtuber is like putting on this like

07:12:15.280 --> 07:12:17.280
horrifically fake personality

07:12:17.520 --> 07:12:20.240
Uh, pinna. Thank you for becoming a member. Um

07:12:21.360 --> 07:12:29.120
The first year is an introduction. The second is establishing and third is plateau. That is quite literally what it is. Um, that is what most um

07:12:29.920 --> 07:12:38.320
People experience. Um, if you've ever been like wait, why did that one in the vtuber, uh, go on a new account?

07:12:39.680 --> 07:12:41.200
um

07:12:41.200 --> 07:12:44.320
that's basically remaking a persona because

07:12:44.960 --> 07:12:49.520
You plateau and it's perfectly natural to plateau. There's no there's no issue

07:12:50.240 --> 07:12:53.600
Um only 155 more. We are mesh

07:12:54.240 --> 07:12:55.440
Oh

07:12:55.440 --> 07:13:02.640
Thank you. Peter ever in ham for becoming a member. I appreciate it. Can I be honest with you all for a sec?

07:13:02.880 --> 07:13:04.880
Right, let's see. What's up

07:13:04.960 --> 07:13:07.120
question mark

07:13:07.120 --> 07:13:08.640
What's up?

07:13:08.640 --> 07:13:10.640
Or does this reefling share with us?

07:13:12.560 --> 07:13:13.600
We will

07:13:13.600 --> 07:13:17.600
Strawny until we die at 99 because it's part of our little heart. Oh

07:13:18.240 --> 07:13:20.560
I far okay. You're done reefling. You're done

07:13:21.360 --> 07:13:25.440
Hmm deeply departed. He came and he farted

07:13:28.400 --> 07:13:34.320
Damn you and people can't just do the same thing successfully without ever needing any variation in their content

07:13:34.400 --> 07:13:36.560
I haven't seen examples of that before. Yes

07:13:37.520 --> 07:13:42.480
Um, I really like the behind the scenes psychology about about at all. Um

07:13:43.440 --> 07:13:45.440
Monster girls, please

07:13:46.000 --> 07:13:52.880
Thank you for coming to member. Is that you asking for gen two designs to be monster girls? Oh boy. You're in for a treat

07:13:53.600 --> 07:13:55.600
um

07:13:56.000 --> 07:13:57.520
Yeah

07:13:57.520 --> 07:14:00.640
There's been two designs that have been accepted

07:14:02.240 --> 07:14:04.240
Lollilolliloll

07:14:06.160 --> 07:14:11.680
Mods take some of his pennies and scatter them across his home wait, that's so specific

07:14:12.400 --> 07:14:14.400
Oh, I don't know

07:14:15.920 --> 07:14:19.280
I feel like you feel happy streaming. I can see that

07:14:20.000 --> 07:14:22.000
Here junior. Can't imagine momy

07:14:22.560 --> 07:14:24.400
without this

07:14:24.400 --> 07:14:28.400
There was obviously right actually I can tell you something behind the scenes

07:14:29.280 --> 07:14:33.520
And you're not gonna like it, but it's no longer the case because I got a script manager in

07:14:34.320 --> 07:14:36.320
If and when gen two came around

07:14:36.720 --> 07:14:42.080
There was no way I could keep up with the daily streaming and trying to organize all the script stuff

07:14:42.640 --> 07:14:46.640
Um, but thank you to script master for coming into play

07:14:47.520 --> 07:14:49.520
because without them

07:14:50.160 --> 07:14:55.600
Being there I with with gen two starting. I probably couldn't daily stream. So

07:14:56.640 --> 07:14:58.240
That that's the honest truth

07:14:58.240 --> 07:15:05.840
I was going to stream my ass off for an entire year like non-stop back-to-back double streams on some days doing like endurance this endurance that

07:15:06.400 --> 07:15:09.680
Um, but thankfully that's no longer the case. Um

07:15:11.520 --> 07:15:13.520
Obviously

07:15:13.600 --> 07:15:16.800
when if and when gen three were to occur

07:15:18.320 --> 07:15:24.560
That's a lot of girls to manage and I'm not sure how realistic the daily streams will be at that point

07:15:25.520 --> 07:15:31.200
There's my only concern and the thing is none of us have a crystal ball to look into the future

07:15:31.360 --> 07:15:39.120
So I can't tell by zero by zero by zero every day is a blessing. No, don't cry. Don't do him. Don't do him

07:15:39.120 --> 07:15:43.040
We're not even there. We've not even we've not even got the first model of gen two

07:15:43.600 --> 07:15:49.600
Literally we have fucking two approved concepts. That's it. Don't burn out in spite. See that's the thing

07:15:49.760 --> 07:15:56.960
Spite can get you very far. Maybe I will spite everyone and just say I'll stream daily and you guys weren't ready for it

07:15:57.360 --> 07:15:59.360
It's so jovert. No

07:15:59.840 --> 07:16:04.320
Less than six kxp for 80 million hp and I'm just telling you

07:16:05.360 --> 07:16:08.080
That I'm from shume brap triber allegations. I've not been been

07:16:08.640 --> 07:16:10.000
No

07:16:10.000 --> 07:16:15.840
Stranny you're talking about the future and the game background is making me feel emotional. Okay. No. No. No. No happy happy thoughts happy thoughts

07:16:16.720 --> 07:16:18.720
um

07:16:18.720 --> 07:16:23.760
If you can do this and not even two weeks. I can't imagine what you're gonna do in a year

07:16:25.040 --> 07:16:28.880
I mean, it's not really gonna change like oh, sorry

07:16:29.440 --> 07:16:30.400
and

07:16:30.400 --> 07:16:32.400
There's not really much like this is

07:16:32.560 --> 07:16:36.480
Me having happy times. We do have some monthly events planned

07:16:37.280 --> 07:16:39.280
and

07:16:39.600 --> 07:16:41.360
type things uh

07:16:41.360 --> 07:16:45.840
Going on got ASMR collabs planned. I think ASMR is like a bread and butter. Please

07:16:46.720 --> 07:16:54.240
Please consider ASMR as a bread and butter of y'all or and some people kind of get annoyed when like ASMR at ASMR

07:16:54.560 --> 07:16:55.120
um

07:16:55.120 --> 07:17:00.640
VTubers dabble and ASMR and don't always like commit to it fully, but no, let's bread and butter

07:17:00.640 --> 07:17:03.200
I think everyone's gonna be participating in it just silly

07:17:04.400 --> 07:17:05.760
um

07:17:05.760 --> 07:17:09.440
Can you spit on us? Yeah, you want me to spit all over your face?

07:17:11.920 --> 07:17:13.920
Open it open your mouth

07:17:15.200 --> 07:17:17.200
I'll let me spit on your face

07:17:18.400 --> 07:17:20.400
um

07:17:20.480 --> 07:17:22.480
Yeah, don't don't worry like

Ah, I see you know judo well and you are you ready to receive my limp

07:23:03.440 --> 07:23:06.800
Just like the blue scottish power ranger meme honestly

07:23:08.320 --> 07:23:10.320
uh

07:23:11.760 --> 07:23:14.640
Pick the memes right and it's probably got a lot of potential

07:23:15.120 --> 07:23:18.400
I thought about doing like reading the most bizarre

07:23:18.800 --> 07:23:23.840
Reddit stories because there's a really famous one where this guy broke both his arms

07:23:24.240 --> 07:23:28.480
But I can't say the rest of it, but I wanted to read it because I thought it was all right

07:23:29.920 --> 07:23:31.920
But I'm not sure it would work out

07:23:32.640 --> 07:23:37.680
Maybe it would be like a twitter series I guess and I'll be like oh go subscribe to my youtube

07:23:43.040 --> 07:23:45.600
Time for work unfortunately have a good stream

07:23:46.480 --> 07:23:52.960

Boss makes a dollar you make a dime. That's why you take a big job beyond company time

Uh, please make sure that any stress levels you feel at work are uh at your pay grade if you get paid minimum wage

07:24:10.080 --> 07:24:12.080
That's not your problem

07:24:14.000 --> 07:24:16.500
Should have paid you more to care more

07:24:18.080 --> 07:24:20.080
They haven't skipped it

07:24:20.320 --> 07:24:25.600
Oh, is that the arm where he gets some help read the number 15

07:24:26.400 --> 07:24:31.200
Burger being but baddest, but that's being boob on being burger being but burger

Bootless. Oh my god. What?

07:24:58.000 --> 07:25:03.760
Um, do a five-part audio where you're getting paid prego each door see me each video around the crack door

07:25:04.000 --> 07:25:06.000
How would I do that though?

07:25:06.800 --> 07:25:08.800
Oh, yeah, give me a bro con

07:25:10.320 --> 07:25:12.560
Oh, no, that's not gonna work

07:25:13.760 --> 07:25:17.200
Maker ginger maker blue hair, but no, why

07:25:18.160 --> 07:25:19.600
what

07:25:19.600 --> 07:25:21.600
We can't make that

07:25:22.800 --> 07:25:28.400
I've got a sea queen audio coming out where I share you with all my daughters

07:25:30.960 --> 07:25:37.120
Um, I always take uh, hmm first thing on my shift if you're good at something never do it for free exactly

07:25:37.200 --> 07:25:39.200
The joker was a kitten

07:25:39.200 --> 07:25:41.200
That's what food coloring is for

07:25:42.400 --> 07:25:47.040
Didn't you get mm-hmm with all the girls at the same time in the ASMR booth with the eyes covered?

07:25:47.120 --> 07:25:49.120
Yeah, basically that's how it happened

07:25:50.320 --> 07:25:52.320
Hmm

07:25:54.240 --> 07:25:58.880
But yeah, I've got a sea queen audio. I don't I think it'll be a donathon reward like because the girls

07:25:59.520 --> 07:26:04.160
and are all gonna like help each other out with their donathon rewards like as uh

07:26:05.280 --> 07:26:07.280
As I like, yeah, let's go

07:26:09.520 --> 07:26:13.360
Sea queen, that's the only way we can that's the new saying

07:26:13.360 --> 07:26:15.360
Um

07:26:15.360 --> 07:26:21.120
POV all the girl velour girls are fighting over you the one human left on earth that hasn't

07:26:21.760 --> 07:26:23.760
Decided on which girl

07:26:24.240 --> 07:26:27.440
I thought about Icy and Emmy doing something like that

07:26:28.240 --> 07:26:30.240
where they're fighting over

07:26:31.840 --> 07:26:36.720
Where the ink goes or who the ink goes to um

07:26:37.440 --> 07:26:39.440
Um

07:26:39.760 --> 07:26:43.680
Sea queen, uh, yeah, I mean it's pretty creative. I'll give you that

07:26:45.520 --> 07:26:50.080
Yeah, Icy and Emmy would a hundred percent fight over it, but I find it really hard

07:26:50.960 --> 07:26:52.240
to do

07:26:52.240 --> 07:26:54.000
that kind of

07:26:54.000 --> 07:26:59.440
Seven five hundred swordfish and I burned two k of them. I burnt so much swordfish as well. Don't worry

07:27:00.400 --> 07:27:05.520
Where the ink goes. Yeah, if I mean Icy ever collab like that, I would be so happy

07:27:06.800 --> 07:27:10.160
I mean they already got a collab audio on the way um of that nature

07:27:11.360 --> 07:27:13.920
Um, but it's a bit different. Uh

07:27:14.960 --> 07:27:18.800
Do you want spoilers or do you not want spoilers? I don't mind doing spoilers

07:27:20.560 --> 07:27:25.040
I think it's coming up. Is it august the collab audio start off? I think it might be

07:27:26.560 --> 07:27:28.320
Um

07:27:28.320 --> 07:27:30.320
It's got to be really hard to do

07:27:30.960 --> 07:27:34.880
I want spoilers no spoilers. Oh, no you guys are split

07:27:37.040 --> 07:27:40.160
Go hard with spoilers. Mmm

07:27:42.000 --> 07:27:43.840
So in the plot

07:27:43.840 --> 07:27:49.040
But close your ears if you don't want any spoilers in the plot Icy and Emmy fell out

07:27:50.400 --> 07:27:54.400
And you the listener and you can either be a pin pal or

07:27:55.360 --> 07:27:59.200
A snowberry wherever when you want you force them to

07:28:01.520 --> 07:28:03.520
To make up

07:28:04.080 --> 07:28:05.840
by

07:28:05.920 --> 07:28:09.600
Using a massage gun to relieve their muscle tension

07:28:10.080 --> 07:28:13.280
Because their muscle tension is the reason why they fell out

07:28:16.720 --> 07:28:19.920
Okay, um, then me and mersey have one

07:28:21.040 --> 07:28:25.360
Where we're uh nurses that shouldn't be qualified because of what we do

07:28:27.440 --> 07:28:34.080
And then Azura and sheebie's one. I don't think the masses are gonna like you

07:28:36.080 --> 07:28:41.520
I'm not gonna change it because I I like the script. I like it, but I'm not sure the masses are gonna like it

07:28:42.320 --> 07:28:44.320
Azura and sheebie

07:28:44.320 --> 07:28:46.320
catch you in public

07:28:46.880 --> 07:28:48.880
um

07:28:49.200 --> 07:28:51.200
Cross-grossing

07:28:51.520 --> 07:28:53.520
And the m word you

07:28:53.920 --> 07:28:56.160
And I don't know if it's gonna go down well or not

07:28:57.280 --> 07:28:59.680
It's a very unique scenario, but please

07:29:00.560 --> 07:29:03.360
And before you're like, oh my god, I hate it. Oh my god, stroney

07:29:03.360 --> 07:29:08.720
I hope you die in a fire because you wrote that do you honestly think they're never gonna do another collab audio again?

07:29:08.720 --> 07:29:10.720
Don't be so silly

07:29:10.720 --> 07:29:12.720
It's just the first one that I gave

07:29:13.600 --> 07:29:19.040
Yeah, it's pretty but it was pretty out there. I don't know. It's just the inspiration. I got to write for them

07:29:19.760 --> 07:29:22.880
So I wrote it and there it was and they what?

07:29:23.680 --> 07:29:29.440
Holy moly, that's a spicy meatball a massage gun. Yes a massage gun. I'm excited for them

07:29:29.520 --> 07:29:33.600
It's spicy. Oh boy that one does sound very uh, yes, uh

07:29:34.800 --> 07:29:36.800
That sounds like something

07:29:37.040 --> 07:29:41.840
Patreon would get no, they don't um, they don't care. Um, I know what's

07:29:42.560 --> 07:29:47.680
Uh, good to go and what's not good to go on patreon. So damn. Yeah, really pretty. Yeah

07:29:48.880 --> 07:29:51.280
I there's a few things I wanted to cover. Um

07:29:54.960 --> 07:29:57.440
Having the freedom to explore a bunch of

07:29:58.320 --> 07:30:00.320
Scripts is something the scripts

07:30:03.360 --> 07:30:09.600
Yeah, like um, it's just different things we're hitting along the way like as I said, I kind of said it from

07:30:10.720 --> 07:30:16.000
I'm not pigeon pigeon holding any girl into a particular

07:30:17.120 --> 07:30:19.120
category because doing so will

07:30:19.920 --> 07:30:26.720
Limit their income source and their income source and longevity are related to their success of yellow

07:30:27.600 --> 07:30:31.600
And I do not want to kneecap anyone. That's not fair

07:30:33.760 --> 07:30:39.600
It is what it is you're given spicy scenarios compared to anything else. I've seen this is some top-tier content. Yes

07:30:40.160 --> 07:30:46.400
And literally when the girls do collab audios again, they still have three other audios going out that month as well

07:30:46.480 --> 07:30:49.360
So it's not like, you know, not everything can be for you

07:30:50.080 --> 07:30:52.320
We live in a society of burnt fish

07:30:52.560 --> 07:30:54.560
I

07:30:55.120 --> 07:31:01.120
Like to try different stuff. Yeah, literally just give it a shot either you'll listen to and you'll be like this isn't for me

07:31:01.280 --> 07:31:03.280
Or you'll be like, okay

07:31:04.080 --> 07:31:06.080
I'm reacting smile

07:31:06.960 --> 07:31:13.040
There's there's only two outcomes. It's either no, thank you and turn it off or I'm reacting smile

07:31:15.600 --> 07:31:21.920
We'll get we'll all get something at some time. Yeah, basically literally everyone is cared for

07:31:22.320 --> 07:31:24.320
It's not possible

07:31:24.320 --> 07:31:27.600
For a creator to come out with something you love 100% of the time

07:31:27.680 --> 07:31:31.280
It's just not possible unless they do the same thing over and over and over again

07:31:31.840 --> 07:31:37.360
But then that is like really pigeonholing and it's it's for the success of my girlies. Okay

07:31:38.320 --> 07:31:40.320
They gotta succeed

07:31:40.320 --> 07:31:44.160
Or what's gonna make them want to sign there the second year of the contract, huh?

07:31:47.840 --> 07:31:50.320
Can't wait to find out what it is. I love

07:31:52.480 --> 07:31:54.480
Oh, I'm glad

07:31:58.640 --> 07:32:01.120
Thanks for reading it anyway, we would

07:32:02.400 --> 07:32:05.280
They just misspelled something and I said it wrong or something. It's okay

07:32:06.560 --> 07:32:09.280
I'm not into feet, but I like yours. Oh, yeah

07:32:12.000 --> 07:32:14.480
I love everything viewers done so far. Thank you

07:32:16.240 --> 07:32:18.240
um

07:32:18.480 --> 07:32:20.480
you know, I had a year in the making and

07:32:21.360 --> 07:32:26.080
Just everything is falling into place so beautifully. Um, I spoke to

07:32:26.560 --> 07:32:29.840
Oh, I'm gonna say her. I'm gonna butcher her names so badly

07:32:30.960 --> 07:32:32.960
The Vtuber obaki

07:32:33.520 --> 07:32:40.400
That's definitely not how you say it, but um, she was talking about a project finally coming together and

07:32:41.200 --> 07:32:44.960
You know, I was like, oh, I can completely relate to that. So I replied to it

07:32:45.680 --> 07:32:52.800
And I was like when the puzzle pieces finally arrive and you can start slotting them into place is so satisfying

07:32:53.520 --> 07:32:55.200
and

07:32:55.200 --> 07:32:57.200
And I felt that to my very core

07:32:58.560 --> 07:33:05.280
The everything obaki pump. Yeah, it's not obaki. There's no way that's how you're supposed to say it sounds like

07:33:05.280 --> 07:33:08.560
I'm trying to say tobacco. Obaki. Obaki

07:33:09.840 --> 07:33:12.400
That's exactly how you say obaki. Oh, wow

07:33:13.280 --> 07:33:18.000
No, me accidentally being smart. I can't believe it

07:33:19.440 --> 07:33:21.440
Obaki obaki

07:33:22.960 --> 07:33:27.120
That is the say say it first try. Oh, I'm so smart with the heck and

07:33:28.320 --> 07:33:34.480
Yeah, she put up a tweet saying like her projects are finally coming together and I'm like, oh, I can relate to that on such a deeper level

07:33:37.680 --> 07:33:40.240
And oh, mommy's excited to be

07:33:41.200 --> 07:33:47.600
Five moods ahead and her main chess game. Oh, I can't wait to one be one years in chess. Actually you guys aren't ready

07:33:49.360 --> 07:33:52.080
Tobacco is true. No, no tobacco

07:33:54.400 --> 07:33:59.840
I can't smoke I can hardly drink to the life of me. I get one beer in me and I'm gone

07:34:00.720 --> 07:34:04.160
That's why I wanted to do drunk apex because we can all do salt lake city

07:34:05.280 --> 07:34:07.280
Because no one's in it other than us

07:34:08.000 --> 07:34:16.160
Uh, I don't know what drunk game. I wanted to do drunk game, but I don't go offline until we win type of thing

07:34:17.040 --> 07:34:19.040
But I didn't know what game to do

07:34:22.080 --> 07:34:26.320
If I lose I get to see discord, right? What? Um

07:34:30.320 --> 07:34:36.000
Wait, what if you lose the one be one chess you get to see the discord where we all say inappropriate stuff to each other

07:34:37.920 --> 07:34:39.920
Say no on that one chief

07:34:40.880 --> 07:34:46.880
I've been a lazy refland. I haven't looked at any of your daughters. Yeah, you haven't. Have you not checked any of them out?

07:34:49.120 --> 07:34:51.120
Actually the highlight

07:34:51.360 --> 07:34:58.080
Reels are from debut or right around the corner. I think there's one more girl that needs to be made

07:35:00.080 --> 07:35:04.080
Um, and then the debut highlight things can be made

07:35:04.640 --> 07:35:09.360
Um can be uploaded. I know that everyone's monetized as well

07:35:11.440 --> 07:35:18.800
What opening do you use in chess? Uh, I call it the twat move because I don't know what what on earth is my opening move

07:35:19.920 --> 07:35:25.520
Probably the second pawn just shove them out by two. Have a wee go

07:35:27.040 --> 07:35:28.640
I don't know nothing about chess

07:35:29.120 --> 07:35:34.480
All I know is that I want a one be one you guys in chess and I'll put classical music on in the background

07:35:34.800 --> 07:35:37.840
And I'll see if I can even win against one refling

07:35:38.960 --> 07:35:41.360
It'll be interesting to see if I can win one game

07:35:43.600 --> 07:35:46.640
I can easily recommend girls like a shopkeeper

07:35:48.800 --> 07:35:50.800
I have a secret conspiracy

07:35:51.120 --> 07:35:55.920
Strony allows a small handful of fans into the discord every month or so to be groomed by the girls

07:35:56.640 --> 07:35:58.800
Then makes them forget and kicks them out

07:36:00.240 --> 07:36:02.240
It's actually quite funny

07:36:02.400 --> 07:36:06.240
No, uh, I sure there absolutely nothing goes on in the discord. Um

07:36:07.120 --> 07:36:09.120
Mercy's ASMR was a banger

07:36:09.600 --> 07:36:17.840
No, her is her meme ASMR. No, I didn't upload it. It couldn't be her actual ASMR stream got 25 000 views, which is insane

07:36:18.800 --> 07:36:20.800
Insane in the membrane

07:36:21.040 --> 07:36:25.680
Can you drill my dad? I'm terrible at chess, but he plays it daily

07:36:26.000 --> 07:36:28.240
Are you joking me? He'd like smoke me in one

07:36:30.240 --> 07:36:34.800
You can play checkers and connect four of his people here. What in runescape?

07:36:38.160 --> 07:36:43.600
Play checker. What play connect four with me in runescape right now. What how do I do that?

07:36:45.760 --> 07:36:47.600
Is that real?

07:36:47.600 --> 07:36:49.600
At the grand exchange

07:36:49.680 --> 07:36:55.600
Hold on. Wait, let me finish doing this batch of fish. We're going to the grand exchange like right now

07:36:56.800 --> 07:36:58.800
Hello

07:36:59.760 --> 07:37:01.920
Where's the grand exchange a little to the right?

07:37:03.120 --> 07:37:08.960
Oh, there's a bridge here. Oh, but we don't have the freaking tunnel at the grand exchange. We're gonna have to go down in our wall

07:37:10.240 --> 07:37:12.720
What we can break in one v one each other

07:37:14.160 --> 07:37:17.280
Right, we're going to the grand exchange to play connect four. I'm not even kidding

07:37:18.560 --> 07:37:20.960
I'll empty my inventory though. I don't want to go filthy

07:37:21.760 --> 07:37:25.520
Stranny, I'd feel bad about beating you in chess. Oh, no, that's the thing. I like losing

07:37:26.720 --> 07:37:28.720
You know dumb loss and all

07:37:31.120 --> 07:37:36.320
You see now if I lose against you after you said you have never played would be such a sad and depressing thing

07:37:36.320 --> 07:37:38.320
I would need something to feel happier

07:37:38.720 --> 07:37:40.960
Get plopped get plopped get plopped there. You're happy

07:37:42.560 --> 07:37:47.200
I'm joined listen to um playing overwatch in the meantime. Oh god. How is overwatch these days?

Folk weren't happy about or something. I've I've nothing apparently she eats rocks lamal

07:38:00.560 --> 07:38:02.560
What rockier? Um

07:38:04.240 --> 07:38:09.440
Right, how the heck right we're going if any reeflings want to follow me just follow my character

07:38:10.000 --> 07:38:14.960
Um, and then we'll go down to the grand exchange to pledge to play connect four

07:38:15.680 --> 07:38:17.680
Any reeflings want to come?

07:38:18.480 --> 07:38:20.480
Uh

07:38:20.880 --> 07:38:26.960
Right, okay, how's it right? We're going to the grand exchange to play connect four. No, I'm not trolling

07:38:27.920 --> 07:38:29.920

07:38:42.720 --> 07:38:49.360
Okay, there that worked. Yeah worked. Okay, we got that reefing. We'll walk around these borders until we're out

07:38:50.560 --> 07:38:53.060
And then I think it should be okay

07:38:54.400 --> 07:38:58.800
Going to the grand exchange to play four in a room

07:38:59.680 --> 07:39:01.680

07:39:03.360 --> 07:39:10.960
Me also me, uh, it's going to take me so long to get 99 cookies and also me. Let's go to the grand exchange

07:39:13.280 --> 07:39:15.280
Just so we can play some bit. Yeah

07:39:15.760 --> 07:39:17.760
Well, we already are

07:39:21.120 --> 07:39:23.360
Look at all that raw fish that needs to cook

07:39:24.720 --> 07:39:28.160
Is the grand exchange the trading hub? It absolutely is

07:39:28.960 --> 07:39:30.960
Oh, wait, we can follow

07:39:33.760 --> 07:39:35.760
We are following rabbit

07:39:36.560 --> 07:39:43.200
There's an entry to the west of the grand exchange. Wait, I thought it was blocked for members only. I don't have any agility though

07:39:45.920 --> 07:39:47.920
Yeah

07:39:48.560 --> 07:39:50.560

07:40:00.480 --> 07:40:02.480
We're learning

07:40:02.480 --> 07:40:04.480
Thanks for being in human history

07:40:05.200 --> 07:40:10.640
Oh, no, we're playing chess and the loser must have be the winner for the day. Oh, what's gonna happen?

07:40:11.680 --> 07:40:14.240
It's annoying tanking is but

07:40:15.600 --> 07:40:17.600

07:40:18.480 --> 07:40:21.920
Okay, where the heck are we playing connect for? How do we do it?

07:40:23.600 --> 07:40:25.600
This

07:40:26.160 --> 07:40:28.160
No

07:40:33.840 --> 07:40:36.640
Talk talk to who talk to them

Oh, no, my rank went down by 47. Oh, no, right. How does the next three film play me?

07:42:15.760 --> 07:42:20.480
Uh, how do I send a request to refling or do you guys send me a request?

07:42:21.760 --> 07:42:23.920
I don't know how to send a request to play

07:42:25.520 --> 07:42:27.520
Uh, I don't know how to play either

07:42:54.800 --> 07:42:59.280
Um, okay take that

This is terrible. Wait, what are you doing? I'm trying to look at what the reflin's doing right a block them there

07:43:11.360 --> 07:43:16.160
Oh, this is awful. Oh, no, you guys can see my thought process. Oh, no, I lost

07:43:17.280 --> 07:43:19.280
I can't put one in one here

07:43:20.400 --> 07:43:22.400
So head out win put it here

07:43:24.800 --> 07:43:27.040
Oh, no, you guys can see how dumb I am

07:43:27.760 --> 07:43:30.160
Wait, what does that mean? Okay. I need to go up here then

07:43:31.360 --> 07:43:34.480
Maybe like do this. No, I'm just gonna do that

07:43:37.360 --> 07:43:39.360

07:43:40.720 --> 07:43:42.720
Oh

07:43:43.360 --> 07:43:45.360
No, you're gonna ruin it for me

07:43:48.160 --> 07:43:53.760
Both of us don't want to play in these ones. Well, I don't want to play because it's gonna get blocked

07:43:56.080 --> 07:44:01.280
What are you doing? What happens if you go there? I don't know one two three one two three

07:44:02.560 --> 07:44:04.560

Oh, no, they can like win again

07:44:21.040 --> 07:44:26.640
Reflings, this is so hard. I don't think I can win. I can't put any here or I lose

07:44:27.360 --> 07:44:28.720
Or here

07:44:28.720 --> 07:44:32.480
So I'm basically just stacking them to the ceiling

07:44:33.360 --> 07:44:35.360
until we can anymore

07:44:36.080 --> 07:44:38.080

07:44:40.720 --> 07:44:42.400

You guys are cheating right one more new reflin

07:44:46.720 --> 07:44:52.560
Come on new refling. This is so bronze connect four. No, right refling do it again

07:44:53.520 --> 07:44:55.520
Okay, you

Surely I could win one

07:44:59.680 --> 07:45:03.760
Uh right i'm gonna go in the middle

07:45:05.840 --> 07:45:08.480
Surely surely I can win

07:45:11.040 --> 07:45:13.040
Okay, I'll go above, you know

07:45:17.440 --> 07:45:22.000
Um, okay. No, you're just mimicking me

07:45:27.280 --> 07:45:29.280
Um

07:45:29.840 --> 07:45:31.840
Oh

07:45:34.640 --> 07:45:36.640
Yes

07:45:39.680 --> 07:45:42.080
Are we just mimicking each other?

07:45:45.200 --> 07:45:47.200
Oh

07:45:51.520 --> 07:45:53.520
Oh

07:49:18.000 --> 07:49:24.080
Oh my god, do you stress me so every so much we're playing I don't know what to do

07:49:26.400 --> 07:49:30.320
Shawnee go in the third column. No, he's gonna win

07:49:31.200 --> 07:49:37.200
If I go in the third column, he'll go there and he gets four in a row

07:49:38.240 --> 07:49:42.560
None of us can play the third column because if he plays wait, why did you do that?

07:49:44.720 --> 07:49:46.720
Why did you do that?

07:49:47.040 --> 07:49:51.520
Did I distract you wait? Why did you do that? Did you mean that you win?

07:49:53.680 --> 07:49:55.680
Are you right? I'm blind

07:51:11.440 --> 07:51:18.240
I think I think we're just playing like crisscross applesauce one of the coolest games ever losing all the rank and honestly

07:51:19.920 --> 07:51:23.040
Yeah, you actually played well intentionally or not wait actually

07:51:23.520 --> 07:51:29.040

07:51:47.280 --> 07:51:49.280

Uh, okay refling made a move. I want to make a move here

07:52:13.040 --> 07:52:15.040
Oh

07:52:16.960 --> 07:52:21.920
Shit, I'm losing at me. Oh, no, how did what I do here?

07:52:24.160 --> 07:52:26.160
No, I can't here

07:52:27.440 --> 07:52:32.400
You know, if I just click the board, oh, there we go. There we go. There we go. Something happened something changed

07:52:33.920 --> 07:52:39.120
Taking mummy over element makes her here. I'm like so dumb. You're all gonna know I'm so dumb

07:52:40.240 --> 07:52:42.240
It's not your turn. Okay

07:52:43.760 --> 07:52:45.760

07:52:58.720 --> 07:53:03.200
You have to sign which the pieces of rent the player. Oh, no, what did he do? I wasn't paying attention

07:53:04.240 --> 07:53:10.080
Can I go here? No, can I go here? No. Oh, I can how did that work? I don't know how I did that

07:53:11.040 --> 07:53:15.920
I'm warning you now refling. I'm taking this entire room. Fuck you. I'm taking this room

07:53:18.320 --> 07:53:20.320
How does this work? I don't know

07:53:21.600 --> 07:53:26.560
This is the most confusing game. Oh, it's my turn. I didn't even see what you changed

07:53:27.440 --> 07:53:28.640
here

07:53:28.640 --> 07:53:30.640
Oh, that was the terrible move

07:53:31.680 --> 07:53:33.680
Here, okay, that was good move

07:53:35.360 --> 07:53:37.360
Uh

07:53:37.920 --> 07:53:39.920
I'm not sure

07:53:41.680 --> 07:53:44.160
He made that right up there. What does that mean to me?

07:53:45.840 --> 07:53:50.400
I don't know. I'll do some points. Can I do this? Can I do that? Can I do this? I can do that

07:53:50.560 --> 07:53:53.040
I'm just I'm just clicking on the board. I'm gonna be honest

07:53:55.040 --> 07:54:00.240
Uh, Stroney, can you hear your sick accent for a little bit? I'm dying to hear it

07:54:01.760 --> 07:54:03.760
We are country. Oh

07:54:03.920 --> 07:54:05.920

God this checkers game is hard

07:54:26.640 --> 07:54:30.320
Oh, I think I messed up. I maybe shouldn't have played that. Oh, no

07:54:33.520 --> 07:54:35.520
Um

07:54:36.240 --> 07:54:38.240
I

07:54:38.560 --> 07:54:42.960
Both of us have no, I don't even know if this refling knows what he's doing. He probably does

07:54:45.280 --> 07:54:47.280
If you are this cute when playing

07:54:47.920 --> 07:54:49.920
Uh, I'll have that love heart solo

07:54:50.560 --> 07:54:54.400
Corners are power spots when playing I can agree on chess and during stream

07:54:54.640 --> 07:54:59.120
I'm too dumb for connect four. Is it my turn yet? Oh, no, it's not. Okay. Now it's my turn. Yeah, get rigged

07:55:00.560 --> 07:55:05.440
I see you're still winning son. Am I? Oh, no, you two back. Wait, how do I take it back?

07:55:05.520 --> 07:55:08.000
Get no, give me back. Give me that. That's mine

07:55:11.520 --> 07:55:16.160
It's stop you're taken. Oh, no, that didn't do anything

07:55:18.480 --> 07:55:23.280
Oh, no, I think I'm losing. What is that? Oh, what?

07:55:24.800 --> 07:55:28.240
Like this does that do something? I don't know what I'm doing

07:55:29.600 --> 07:55:32.560
I think I may I think we have to admit defeat unfortunately

07:55:33.520 --> 07:55:36.960
Oh, I'm getting rolled everything's getting taken

07:55:39.840 --> 07:55:42.960
I don't have the strength reflends. I'm doing so bad

07:55:47.200 --> 07:55:48.560
Oh

07:55:48.560 --> 07:55:50.560
Connect your pieces

07:55:50.560 --> 07:55:52.560
Oh corner someone says corner

07:55:53.760 --> 07:55:57.520
Don't play the corner. Oh sugar that didn't do anything

07:55:58.720 --> 07:56:00.560
Oh, no

Uh, but that turned green a little bit green

07:56:11.200 --> 07:56:18.000
I guess it's like splatoon where you want everything to be your colors. Oh, that didn't do anything. Oops. I think I just threw that

07:56:18.880 --> 07:56:24.320
You lose the board is filled. Oh, no, it was so hard. That was confusing

07:56:25.120 --> 07:56:31.760
Uh, maybe we only do the other one. Oh, Amy wants to play. Yeah, sure. Amy will play

07:56:33.760 --> 07:56:35.120

07:57:37.520 --> 07:57:41.440

08:01:35.760 --> 08:01:42.800
This is terrible right cool again. There has to be one reefling in here that's called lower IQ than me. Come on

08:01:44.000 --> 08:01:46.000
Let's I've not played through yet

08:01:46.800 --> 08:01:51.680
There has to be a reefling that has a lower IQ. What the heck is this?

08:01:52.960 --> 08:01:54.960
What do I do?

08:01:55.120 --> 08:01:57.120
Examine what?

08:01:58.000 --> 08:02:00.000
No, I don't know what to do

08:02:00.800 --> 08:02:05.200
You just I click it? Wait, it's not let me do anything

08:02:07.920 --> 08:02:11.680
Huh, it's not let me do anything. Hello

08:02:13.840 --> 08:02:15.840
Examine board game piece

08:02:17.280 --> 08:02:21.200
Huh, you move you move and jump diagonally

08:02:22.800 --> 08:02:23.920
Oh

08:02:23.920 --> 08:02:27.360
Okay, okay, we hold it you hold it and then drop it wait

08:02:28.320 --> 08:02:34.000
I'm getting pranked why why am I getting pranked? What what what happened?

08:02:36.080 --> 08:02:38.080
Wait

08:02:38.320 --> 08:02:39.760
No

08:02:39.760 --> 08:02:41.840
What?

08:02:41.840 --> 08:02:43.840
I think it's a bit laggy

08:02:46.240 --> 08:02:51.520
Can I just start moving them everywhere? No, they're tired. I'm sorry

08:02:53.600 --> 08:02:55.600
Okay, wait

08:02:55.760 --> 08:02:59.600
I can't move them. No, so I move you

08:03:02.320 --> 08:03:04.320
What the heck

08:03:06.960 --> 08:03:11.520
Uh, then you block me so I block you

08:03:14.160 --> 08:03:16.160
What

08:03:21.680 --> 08:03:23.680
Hey

08:03:26.000 --> 08:03:28.000
Uh

08:03:29.600 --> 08:03:31.600
Can I go back?

08:03:32.640 --> 08:03:37.280
A legal move bro. I don't even know the rule book. I don't want to get jailed

08:03:42.560 --> 08:03:44.560
And what like this

08:03:45.760 --> 08:03:48.320
No, I can't, can I? Maybe

08:03:50.640 --> 08:03:52.640
I don't, wait what?

08:03:53.600 --> 08:03:59.120
Like this, okay, that was a load. Why are some things loaded? No

08:04:03.760 --> 08:04:05.760
Oh

08:04:06.560 --> 08:04:08.320
Hold

08:04:08.320 --> 08:04:11.920
In the name of the checkers board. Wait, I can't do that. Hold in the name of the check

08:04:12.080 --> 08:04:15.840
Hold in the name of the checkers board. Hold in the name of the checkers board

08:04:19.040 --> 08:04:21.040
What this is crazy

08:04:23.280 --> 08:04:28.800
I'm sorry. My little brain can't do this. Maybe we just play the four in a room

08:04:30.400 --> 08:04:37.200
You can only move one tail if you're jumping over an enemy as many times as you can. What happened? I wasn't paying attention. Oh, no

08:04:37.760 --> 08:04:39.760
Something happened

08:04:41.040 --> 08:04:43.840
You can only jump a tail so here

08:04:46.160 --> 08:04:49.920
No, it's not your turn. Oh, sorry. What and then do that

08:04:50.640 --> 08:04:52.640
What the heck

08:04:54.960 --> 08:04:56.960
Am I accidentally winning right now?

08:04:59.280 --> 08:05:00.640
I might be

08:05:00.640 --> 08:05:07.920
It's plausible. Hold on. Can you go back? Oh, you can't go back. You can only go up. Okay. Wait, that didn't do anything

08:05:11.200 --> 08:05:13.200
Can you be like gridlocked in this game?

08:05:16.400 --> 08:05:18.400
Yes

08:05:19.280 --> 08:05:23.840
Uh, sure go up there then. Wow. What am I doing? I can't go back

08:05:25.840 --> 08:05:28.400
If you reach the end of the board you get knighted

08:05:30.240 --> 08:05:33.120
Oh, neither. Oh, no, he won

08:05:35.920 --> 08:05:37.920
I lost again

08:05:39.680 --> 08:05:42.160
Reflames. Oh my god

08:05:42.400 --> 08:05:44.400
Oh

08:05:45.920 --> 08:05:51.200
No, he won I can't go back and we'll let me go back on him

08:05:55.760 --> 08:06:00.480
Right, okay, what can I do? I can't even go forward or anything. I just did that

08:06:01.600 --> 08:06:06.960
Game ends when all the pieces are taken. How can they be taken? We can't go backwards

08:06:08.400 --> 08:06:11.680
I don't get it. I'm so confused. He's not won yet

08:06:12.240 --> 08:06:14.240
What?

08:06:18.480 --> 08:06:23.200
Wait, so if he comes here, I can only jump forward one

08:06:27.040 --> 08:06:29.040
This is too hard

08:06:30.480 --> 08:06:34.000
Oh, no, what happened? Something changed. I don't know

08:06:36.560 --> 08:06:39.200
So I can't go backwards. I can only go forwards

08:06:40.080 --> 08:06:42.080
Well, then I might as well push forward then

08:06:43.120 --> 08:06:45.840
Surely surely that's how it works

08:06:48.720 --> 08:06:51.040
Okay, and now then I take you

08:06:52.800 --> 08:06:55.600
No, I can't take you you're too far away from me

08:06:57.280 --> 08:07:02.240
Then I push you forward to play I guess

08:07:03.760 --> 08:07:07.680
No, I don't one at a time. Sorry one move at a time. Apologies one step

08:07:08.400 --> 08:07:10.400
Oh, this is so hard

08:07:10.640 --> 08:07:15.840
Oh, no, my guy got taken. Wait, how do you so I can only go one way

08:07:18.240 --> 08:07:23.040
Then that would push what that pushes him there and then I can't push up so I need to do that

08:07:23.120 --> 08:07:25.520
Oh, no, that blocks him. Oh, I didn't mean to do that

08:07:26.480 --> 08:07:28.480
Uh

08:07:29.600 --> 08:07:31.600
What is a knight do I don't know

08:07:33.920 --> 08:07:36.560
I'm not sure can he take everything now

08:07:38.640 --> 08:07:40.640
Hmm

08:07:40.720 --> 08:07:42.720
And then can go backwards

08:07:44.160 --> 08:07:47.600
Oh, wait, so I just need to move him forward like here

08:07:48.720 --> 08:07:50.720
Okay, I'll push him forward

08:07:50.720 --> 08:07:54.880
Okay, I'll push him. Oh, he got taken right. Hold on. I'll push him forward then

08:07:56.480 --> 08:07:59.440
Wait, am I gonna perish? I think I'm gonna perish. I don't think I can win

08:08:00.480 --> 08:08:02.640
And then you move up. Oh, no, I didn't mean that

08:08:03.600 --> 08:08:05.600
Yeah

08:08:07.200 --> 08:08:09.200
And then I could I never push up

08:08:10.080 --> 08:08:12.080
And then what what happened then

08:08:12.800 --> 08:08:14.800
In the head. No, okay

08:08:15.680 --> 08:08:19.040
Yeah, I was no I'm not winning that one. Okay, let's try again. Let's try again

08:08:20.160 --> 08:08:22.160
That was yeah, that was

08:08:24.320 --> 08:08:30.320
I wasn't sure about that one. I'm sure about that one. Uh, Renry slaying. I don't think I've played with you yet

08:08:33.280 --> 08:08:37.280
Okay, surely I can win. Oh, it's not my turn yet. Oops

08:08:38.160 --> 08:08:40.480
Oops gotta be there. Okay you

08:08:41.840 --> 08:08:43.840
You are getting

08:08:45.680 --> 08:08:47.680
Can't handle it

08:08:49.280 --> 08:08:51.280
Uh

08:08:58.160 --> 08:09:00.160
Block you from doing it there

08:09:01.120 --> 08:09:03.120
I'll take you

08:09:07.440 --> 08:09:11.600
Oh, no, this refling's thinking you're not supposed to think against me

08:09:15.040 --> 08:09:18.480
Monka, what's this refling thinking? I don't know. He's taking his time

08:09:20.720 --> 08:09:24.400
I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous what he's planning

08:09:25.680 --> 08:09:28.800
I don't know what he's doing. I can't see it if he's doing something

08:09:30.720 --> 08:09:32.720
I don't see it

08:09:34.640 --> 08:09:37.920
Here, I don't know what reason's planning

08:09:42.160 --> 08:09:45.920
Well, I'll take that then you're not getting a four in the rule on me

08:09:47.840 --> 08:09:49.920
I don't know if I do this. No

08:09:54.640 --> 08:09:56.640
I block you

08:10:00.160 --> 08:10:02.160
No

08:10:09.520 --> 08:10:13.520
No, you weren't supposed to see yeah, you're supposed to be like

08:10:14.240 --> 08:10:17.520
La-dee-da-dee-da strong. He's too dumb to figure this out

08:10:19.360 --> 08:10:21.360
Uh

08:10:22.320 --> 08:10:24.320
Okay

08:10:24.480 --> 08:10:27.200
So now what you're gonna put it there

08:10:27.760 --> 08:10:33.760
No, he's gonna put there. Wait, hold on. What would that achieve one two three three three

08:10:34.960 --> 08:10:37.440
So if I put it there, he has to go there so yeah

08:10:39.840 --> 08:10:42.320
Will she finally get the dub? I have no idea

08:10:43.120 --> 08:10:47.440
There has to be a refling that's lower IQ than me. Wait, you block me

08:10:50.240 --> 08:10:55.200
Oh sugar, I wasn't supposed to do that. Oopsies. I foiled my own plan

08:10:55.600 --> 08:10:59.360
Literally, you don't even need to like counteract me. I counteract myself

08:11:00.480 --> 08:11:02.480
Like a dumb dumb

08:11:03.680 --> 08:11:06.960
You already beat me strong in my IQ is too low

08:11:08.560 --> 08:11:10.480
This is hard

08:11:10.480 --> 08:11:14.720
You're kicked is so bad. Wait, we'll have one two

08:11:15.920 --> 08:11:17.920
Four you can't

08:11:18.480 --> 08:11:20.480
So never

08:11:21.680 --> 08:11:23.680
No

08:11:24.640 --> 08:11:26.640
I'm so confused

08:11:32.000 --> 08:11:34.000
Um

08:11:34.080 --> 08:11:36.480
Are we both playing the same game right now?

08:11:38.080 --> 08:11:42.080
We're both scared to play here because I win if he plays here

08:11:43.920 --> 08:11:45.920
Oh, no

08:11:46.800 --> 08:11:48.800
Oh

08:11:49.520 --> 08:11:52.400
Bro, why is this game so freaking hard to win?

08:11:53.280 --> 08:11:58.000
Honestly one he is all um. No, I've already played you all of us

08:11:58.800 --> 08:12:02.800
Literally, how are you all smarter than me? This doesn't make any sense

08:12:03.920 --> 08:12:05.920
How are you so freaking smart?

08:12:09.280 --> 08:12:11.920
Bro, how is this game so hard?

08:12:12.080 --> 08:12:14.080
Oh

08:12:14.320 --> 08:12:18.080
You could have won just placed in the middle. No, he was gonna block me

08:12:20.960 --> 08:12:22.720
Oh

08:12:22.720 --> 08:12:28.480
Surely I can win one surely freaking temples. I can win one one faking

08:12:29.280 --> 08:12:30.560
round

08:12:30.560 --> 08:12:34.160
Of this. This is so hard. It's cuz we're

08:12:35.040 --> 08:12:37.040
It's cuz we're men

08:12:37.360 --> 08:12:41.280
Riefland you can't see that part of load. That's supposed to be the quiet part

08:12:45.120 --> 08:12:50.640
Be honest, I was barely screaming by my brain's bright, bro. I'm like fainting this so

08:12:55.600 --> 08:12:58.480
Like I'm gonna get ranked ranked

08:13:00.960 --> 08:13:02.960
No

08:13:04.160 --> 08:13:06.160
Are you squidding me right now?

08:13:07.120 --> 08:13:13.280
Hello miss cuttles. How is your Friday night? It's going good, but I'm getting freaking rigged. I'm getting ruined

08:13:13.360 --> 08:13:15.360
I was gonna do something here. Wait

08:13:17.040 --> 08:13:19.040
Ah

08:13:19.600 --> 08:13:21.600
Did you did you let me win?

08:13:24.080 --> 08:13:25.520
Did I win

08:13:25.520 --> 08:13:28.480
Did I win when I win I win out. Yeah

08:13:29.280 --> 08:13:34.000
Okay, hold on. I want to do that again see when I win I get serotonin when I don't win I get

08:13:34.240 --> 08:13:35.360
Ah

08:13:35.360 --> 08:13:39.200
Who we got tiny cuttles? I played you. I haven't played you yet

08:13:40.720 --> 08:13:42.720
Whoa, my tickle is here. Hold on

08:13:43.840 --> 08:13:46.080
Give me one minute. I need to go answer the door

08:13:56.320 --> 08:13:58.320
My bets that game leaves about to come flying

08:14:04.000 --> 08:14:06.000
Oh

08:14:34.000 --> 08:14:36.000
Oh

08:14:46.080 --> 08:14:51.280
Okay, I'm gonna be eating and doing this at the same time. So you must forgive me if I'm extra dumb

08:14:51.920 --> 08:14:56.080
Thank you the ton of two for the two. I'm currently getting wrecked at runescape

08:14:57.200 --> 08:15:01.360
And it's not looking good. How do I counteract this? I need to go here

08:15:04.080 --> 08:15:05.360
Ah

08:15:05.360 --> 08:15:08.560
And then I need to stop you from making a four over here

08:15:10.400 --> 08:15:12.400
This is such a big

08:15:17.520 --> 08:15:19.520
Sugar, why are you so tall?

08:15:20.800 --> 08:15:23.600
I feel like I'm gonna lose this one. Well, you think I can't do it

08:15:26.160 --> 08:15:28.720
Oh my god, I'm eating chips and it's so good

08:15:31.440 --> 08:15:33.440
All right, so yummy

08:15:34.960 --> 08:15:36.960
I

08:15:37.360 --> 08:15:39.360
Chicken wrap with sugar

08:15:40.400 --> 08:15:43.760
Wait, is that a thing? No, it's just a chicken burrito wrap

08:15:45.280 --> 08:15:49.440
Oh, no, this is a lot of red. I don't like it. I see red. I see red. I see red

08:15:50.720 --> 08:15:52.720
Uh here

08:17:19.440 --> 08:17:22.560
Everyone's are gonna start and we're getting so distracted trying to win

08:17:23.600 --> 08:17:25.600
Why didn't it work?

08:17:26.160 --> 08:17:28.160
Okay, there we go

08:17:29.840 --> 08:17:33.520
Uh here. Oh no, I'm blue

08:17:34.800 --> 08:17:36.800
Abba di abba die. I'm blue

08:17:38.000 --> 08:17:40.000
I would be off a guy

08:17:41.120 --> 08:17:47.840
Now listen up. Here's the story about a little car. Oh fish in the deep blue sea

08:17:48.240 --> 08:17:54.800
Everything was blue and this is the minimum. Yeah, nobody to listen

08:17:56.160 --> 08:17:58.160
Um

08:17:58.160 --> 08:18:00.160
Blue I would be double guys

08:18:04.240 --> 08:18:06.240
Wow

08:18:06.880 --> 08:18:12.560
Oh, it's cool on my hands that guy literally me. I'm blue if I was green I would

08:18:14.320 --> 08:18:16.320
Hold on get my burrito at my wee box

08:18:18.640 --> 08:18:22.480
Ah, yeah, um, I can't do that

08:18:24.640 --> 08:18:26.640
I need to do that. I don't know

08:18:30.160 --> 08:18:35.760
Oh, no, you're supposed to do that. I'm gonna hear them. You're wet far

08:18:38.640 --> 08:18:41.520
No, you're not supposed to win against me

08:18:42.480 --> 08:18:47.840
Okay, I'm opening up my burrito my burrito with no cilantro

08:18:47.840 --> 08:18:49.840
Oh

08:19:07.760 --> 08:19:09.760
He's doing that he's gunning for that

08:19:10.640 --> 08:19:15.200
I can tell reflin. I can see right through your thought process right now. No, I was gonna put there

08:19:15.920 --> 08:19:21.840
Wait, why can I not put here? I don't know. He puts here. I put there

08:19:22.640 --> 08:19:25.140
He no I put there. He puts there

08:19:26.400 --> 08:19:28.400
I win

08:19:28.880 --> 08:19:33.600
But why would he do that? One two one two three he won

08:19:40.560 --> 08:19:42.560
You could have had it spare um

08:19:46.160 --> 08:19:48.160
You

08:19:48.800 --> 08:19:50.800
Oh wait, oh no

08:19:51.520 --> 08:19:55.280
Oh, no, I just I remembered like literally as I put that down

08:19:56.320 --> 08:19:58.160
Oh my god

08:19:58.160 --> 08:20:01.120
Bro, I literally just threw that game. I could have won that

08:20:03.040 --> 08:20:05.040
Bro

08:20:05.040 --> 08:20:06.160
I could have won it

08:20:06.160 --> 08:20:11.280
Grimble law I will conquer the world reality connect for hard love you strongy

08:20:11.600 --> 08:20:12.720
Oh

08:20:12.720 --> 08:20:16.880
It is too hard. It's so freaking hard to win. Grimble. Thank you for the tip

08:20:17.120 --> 08:20:21.360
Literally hypnosis is the only reason I can get away with it. Have I played with D reflame?

08:20:22.240 --> 08:20:24.080
I don't think so

08:20:24.080 --> 08:20:27.920
You go again. Boom. Oh, it's not know my turn

08:20:31.520 --> 08:20:37.760
I will deserve loss. Okay. Look I have room temperature IQ. I'm trying my best

08:20:41.840 --> 08:20:44.880
Um, right. No, don't do that

08:20:58.640 --> 08:21:02.240
But I think you played them all at least once now. Yeah

08:21:03.280 --> 08:21:05.280
go away

08:21:05.600 --> 08:21:12.240
Our darling low IQ feature, but honestly more like our dangerously low IQ feature

08:21:24.400 --> 08:21:26.400
I love

08:21:27.680 --> 08:21:33.920
You want chicken is the mvp. I'm not even playing. Oh, no, that is a good one two three four

08:21:35.840 --> 08:21:37.840
What if I go here then

08:21:43.600 --> 08:21:45.600
I don't know what happened if I do

08:21:48.400 --> 08:21:51.680
I freaking love chicken so it's like the best meat source ever

08:21:55.040 --> 08:22:02.640
A girl's when girls are curious when they're almost reeflings. Uh, oh wait, is that matter? Oh sugar. Um, um, what did you do?

08:22:03.200 --> 08:22:09.280
What did you do? Thank you for the game strong. Oh, you're welcome. You don't have to take me for that

08:22:09.280 --> 08:22:12.240
I have no idea what you did though. Oh wait, or this reason

08:22:13.840 --> 08:22:17.520
What did you do? Was it something here? I think I'm having something here

08:22:20.000 --> 08:22:22.000
Um

08:22:24.160 --> 08:22:26.160
Papago

08:22:27.040 --> 08:22:33.200
Uh, right, what happens if I go here? I don't know. Maybe I need to go down here

08:22:37.840 --> 08:22:39.840
Um

08:22:40.480 --> 08:22:42.480
Here maybe

08:22:43.040 --> 08:22:45.040
I don't know

08:22:46.320 --> 08:22:48.320
If I go here they'll lose I hope no

08:22:49.120 --> 08:22:51.120
One two three

08:23:05.760 --> 08:23:08.880
So hard I don't even see it

08:23:11.040 --> 08:23:13.840
I literally can't even see it. I like at all

08:23:13.840 --> 08:23:20.240
This is so hard. Is there any reeflings that haven't gone against?

08:23:21.840 --> 08:23:23.840
I have a lot of guys everyone here

08:23:27.600 --> 08:23:32.800
That's so hard right have I gone against everyone here? I may have you know that

08:23:33.840 --> 08:23:35.360
um

08:23:35.360 --> 08:23:38.000
Are you a beautiful all fans all fans?

08:23:39.840 --> 08:23:42.880
Uh, maybe they're just confused why there's so many people here

08:23:44.000 --> 08:23:47.360
Does anyone want to go again? Because I can play while I eat

08:23:49.680 --> 08:23:53.200
But beyond range I think we're on room two. I think everyone's having a fair share

08:23:58.000 --> 08:24:00.000
Um

08:24:00.000 --> 08:24:03.840
Look at all you guys have like numbers and stuff now because you'd be beating me

08:24:04.480 --> 08:24:06.480
Hold on

08:24:06.640 --> 08:24:08.640
Um

08:24:10.160 --> 08:24:13.280
I don't even know my phone. I'll pass. I've been meant to do it in that one

08:24:15.760 --> 08:24:17.760
Hmm

08:24:18.400 --> 08:24:23.040
Yeah, yeah, that's the best corner in location. I'll pay out

08:24:26.560 --> 08:24:28.560
You should both

08:24:31.360 --> 08:24:35.520
The same thing is you actually could have won three times if you went play some tales random like

08:24:36.240 --> 08:24:40.080
I'm trying to think ahead of my moves. Okay, it's hard

08:24:44.400 --> 08:24:46.400
Oh my god, this is delicious

08:24:48.880 --> 08:24:51.280
Reeflings do you want me to baby bird you because I'll do it

08:24:51.280 --> 08:24:53.280
Yep

08:25:04.400 --> 08:25:09.600
Uh, don't like the look of that. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky

08:25:16.880 --> 08:25:18.880
Oh, no

08:25:22.240 --> 08:25:25.840
Why do I not see it? Why do I not see it coming?

08:25:27.520 --> 08:25:33.840
Why do I not see it coming? I'm being so for real right now, right at the next one. I am not losing

08:25:34.080 --> 08:25:36.400
I don't care what happens. I am not losing

08:25:38.400 --> 08:25:40.400
I am tryharding so much

08:25:41.360 --> 08:25:44.000
I am not losing this one. I'm so serious

08:25:44.400 --> 08:25:51.520
Are we bimbo max I literally don't see it right you've placed it in the middle. That's fine

08:25:53.120 --> 08:25:55.840
Is it I don't know we'll place it next to you then

08:25:59.200 --> 08:26:06.640
That's fine, so I'll counter you from doing four in a row on the bottom and then I'll do this

08:26:07.280 --> 08:26:09.280
All right

08:26:11.840 --> 08:26:16.640
One two three so you can't go anywhere there but I can progress by going here

08:26:21.040 --> 08:26:23.920
And that's fine you're allowed to do that

08:26:27.040 --> 08:26:29.040
Right

08:26:29.680 --> 08:26:31.680
Did I do it?

08:26:31.920 --> 08:26:33.920
Uh, oh wait

08:26:34.480 --> 08:26:36.480
What I thought I won there

08:26:37.600 --> 08:26:39.440
Wait

08:26:39.440 --> 08:26:41.440
Wait, why why did I not win there?

08:26:42.880 --> 08:26:46.480
Like this did I counter them by going that way?

08:26:49.040 --> 08:26:56.400
I will redeem myself. Oh no, right one two three four so drop it here

08:27:00.480 --> 08:27:02.480
I'm tryharding I'm looking

08:27:04.080 --> 08:27:11.200
All right, if you're there what one two three four fuck you

08:27:18.480 --> 08:27:20.480
One two three four

08:27:22.880 --> 08:27:27.280
What you try to do one two three here so I can't put it in this column

08:27:27.280 --> 08:27:29.280
Um

08:27:30.800 --> 08:27:32.800
Right you've put it up there, which is fine

08:27:35.120 --> 08:27:37.120
Oh fuck you you blocked me

08:27:38.880 --> 08:27:40.880
Uh

08:27:40.960 --> 08:27:42.960
Right

08:27:43.760 --> 08:27:45.760
So what happens now?

08:27:46.480 --> 08:27:50.560
What did that do? No you're getting blocked. I don't know what you're doing, but don't do it

08:27:53.520 --> 08:27:55.680
I don't know what you're doing there, but don't do it

08:27:58.160 --> 08:28:00.560
What are you doing over here now?

08:28:03.840 --> 08:28:05.840
That's fine

08:28:07.360 --> 08:28:09.360
Whoa

08:28:11.200 --> 08:28:18.000
Get rekt get rekt get absolutely rekt. Oh my god. I did it. I was like trying so hard

08:28:18.080 --> 08:28:23.520
I was trying to see what you were trying to do. I was playing two characters at once on the board. Oh, we did it

08:28:24.080 --> 08:28:27.120
I have lower connect for IQ

08:28:29.840 --> 08:28:35.120
Okay, let's try again. All right, hold on. Let me take a bite of my food. Oh my god. I had to try so hard for that

08:28:40.080 --> 08:28:42.080
Okay

08:28:43.440 --> 08:28:45.440
Oh my god, that was so hard

08:28:46.240 --> 08:28:50.640
I don't know how people play logic games all the time. I feel like my brain just gets so tired. I'm like, oh

08:28:54.480 --> 08:28:56.480
I

08:29:04.160 --> 08:29:07.920
Oh, shit. Oh, this is not looking good

08:29:15.200 --> 08:29:17.760
Am I gonna throw I don't know what what you're trying to do

08:29:20.640 --> 08:29:22.640
What are you trying to do

08:29:23.600 --> 08:29:28.720
Don't feel bad. My brain is still at max capacity. Oh, no, what did you do? I wasn't paying attention, right? You get blocked

08:29:38.640 --> 08:29:40.640
Oh

08:29:41.360 --> 08:29:43.360
It's so hard

08:29:43.920 --> 08:29:47.920
Bro, when you go back to cooking swordfish, this is so hard. How?

08:29:49.280 --> 08:29:52.800
I never see it. I like physically can't see it coming

08:29:54.160 --> 08:29:56.160
until I hear the

08:29:59.280 --> 08:30:03.920
Bro girlfriend is pouty and frustrated and upset. She got destroyed and fucking

08:30:04.720 --> 08:30:10.960
Not even just destroyed in runescape destroyed in runescapes like side player gate. Oh god. I'm sorry

08:30:16.880 --> 08:30:20.080
Wait, how did I double down there? I didn't even need to find I'm tripling down

08:30:20.080 --> 08:30:22.080
Oh

08:30:31.760 --> 08:30:33.760
So I'm choking on my burrito in anger

08:30:35.760 --> 08:30:37.760
Because I'm so bad at this game

08:30:46.160 --> 08:30:48.160
No, you're gonna win

08:30:48.720 --> 08:30:49.920
No

08:30:49.920 --> 08:30:55.680
Look at freaking low my scores. Let's start on the third. Oh my god. You're so good to win. What are you doing?

08:30:57.040 --> 08:30:59.040
One two three

08:31:00.240 --> 08:31:02.240
I don't know what I'm doing either to be honest

08:31:12.400 --> 08:31:14.400
Ah, what are you doing?

08:31:16.000 --> 08:31:17.680
Stop

08:31:17.680 --> 08:31:23.520
You're stressing me out. This reefland's gonna win. They're like genuinely stressing me out right get blocked

08:31:25.920 --> 08:31:32.480
No, oh my god, I hate right we're going. No, I'm sorry. We're going back to edgeville. I'm actually fucking done

08:31:32.560 --> 08:31:38.960
I'm actually I'm done. We're going back to edgeville. I'm not even I'm not even doing we're going back to edgeville

08:31:39.120 --> 08:31:41.440
I'm so done. I'm so done

08:31:42.400 --> 08:31:48.000
I'm going back to edgeville to cook freaking swordfish. This is so hard

08:31:49.040 --> 08:31:54.800
This is so hard. I should surprise the exam get to fuck. I've got the lowest IQ in the uh

08:31:56.000 --> 08:31:59.360
freaking lower than room temperature water. Oh my god

08:32:01.680 --> 08:32:03.680
Why is that game so hard?

08:32:04.480 --> 08:32:06.480
freaking the uh

08:32:06.480 --> 08:32:08.480
To no one's surprise

08:32:08.560 --> 08:32:14.480
The 1v1 chess stream has been delayed due to the fact that I'm probably gonna have to actually watch some chess tutorials

08:32:14.560 --> 08:32:16.560
Because I don't know how the rules work

08:32:18.160 --> 08:32:22.160
If she she starts speaking if you start speaking germy should really stop playing

08:32:22.240 --> 08:32:26.160
I respect your dedication not to apply mind bullets to them to gain victory

08:32:26.240 --> 08:32:32.240
To gain a victory is that what I should have done? I should just start like taking the bikini off and all that like bro

08:32:33.120 --> 08:32:35.120
I was so hard for no reason

08:32:36.560 --> 08:32:38.800
Take the random event. Oh, is it good? Sorry

08:32:40.880 --> 08:32:46.240
Hello, uh, yeah, sure. I fancy an exam right. What's my oh, what is this?

08:32:46.720 --> 08:32:50.160
Ah, she's got a fish. You've been slacking in your studies. It's time for an exam

08:32:53.920 --> 08:32:56.800
They are thank you for the tip boy. They literally are though

08:32:58.000 --> 08:33:02.000
There are two types of questions one requires you to find the next object in a pattern

08:33:02.480 --> 08:33:05.520
And the second I will present you with 15 cards and a hint

08:33:06.240 --> 08:33:11.920
That's so specific. What are we doing? What comes next shoes shoes shoes shoes?

08:33:12.960 --> 08:33:16.640
That's correct. Next question pick the object that should come next to a pattern

08:33:18.240 --> 08:33:20.560
A banana a dookie a pineapple

08:33:21.680 --> 08:33:23.680
a slice of watermelon

08:33:24.560 --> 08:33:28.480
Finally a pupil that uses her brains. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure sure

08:33:29.840 --> 08:33:32.960
Uh, these are gardening tools. So we need a rate

08:33:33.840 --> 08:33:39.360
To the exit. Okay. We did it. We did it. Please don't fail. Imagine if I did this

08:33:43.200 --> 08:33:49.520
Oh my god, did you hear that the burrito just kissed me from the way I bit it? What's the book of knowledge to do?

08:33:50.480 --> 08:33:52.320
Oh fishing

08:33:52.320 --> 08:33:54.320
It took him

08:33:56.560 --> 08:33:59.680
Wait, oh that wasn't to him. Oh my god

08:33:59.680 --> 08:34:01.680
Oh

08:34:02.240 --> 08:34:04.080
My god

08:34:04.080 --> 08:34:06.080
Just when you think I couldn't get dumber

08:34:06.800 --> 08:34:08.400
I just put

08:34:08.400 --> 08:34:11.280
XP into fire making instead of cooking. Bruv

08:34:12.320 --> 08:34:14.320
Can this get any worse?

08:34:14.960 --> 08:34:22.000
I don't think it's any more obvious how low my IQ is holy crap. It's even a miracle. I can breathe and eat at the same time

08:34:22.880 --> 08:34:24.880

08:34:24.880 --> 08:34:26.880

Absolutely. All right, let me keep eating this burrito before it gets cold

08:35:15.920 --> 08:35:17.920

That was thank you for the tip. Oh my god, my hand's covered in sauce

08:35:42.640 --> 08:35:47.280
See I'm not afraid to like sauce off after reefing as I choke on a piece of corn

08:35:47.760 --> 08:35:49.760
I can't talk and freaking

08:35:50.560 --> 08:35:52.560

08:35:58.960 --> 08:36:00.960
Oh my god

That was so hard for no reason. I've never played connect for like that at a very long time

08:36:06.240 --> 08:36:08.240
Bruh, I suck at anything logic based

08:36:10.720 --> 08:36:12.720

08:36:13.280 --> 08:36:15.280
Is there connect for championships

08:36:16.240 --> 08:36:20.080
Could you imagine? You know how you get a rank in chess?

08:36:21.840 --> 08:36:28.000

Let's go to the booth

08:41:53.760 --> 08:41:56.720
Am I dumb but can I ask what munker means munker

And munker s is a twitch emote where peppy looks really stressed out and he's like oh like like nervous

And and I reduce it to munker like munker

08:42:08.880 --> 08:42:10.720

08:42:10.720 --> 08:42:16.240
But if you type in munker s on google, it'll just show you what peppy looks like he's all stressed out

08:42:16.560 --> 08:42:18.560

08:42:39.920 --> 08:42:41.920

08:42:42.320 --> 08:42:44.320
Time for a hypnotic slumber

08:42:47.120 --> 08:42:49.120
Hmm

08:42:54.560 --> 08:43:00.000
Sleep is for the weakest weekend now sleep equals exp wasted

08:43:02.880 --> 08:43:10.240
Oh my god, we're like really close to level or not next batch. I don't know what level 40 f 74

08:43:10.240 --> 08:43:12.240
Yeah

08:43:18.960 --> 08:43:20.960
I hate arching on mobile

08:43:21.360 --> 08:43:23.120
hmm

08:43:23.120 --> 08:43:26.160
See we've got like a billion different things to click to do anything

08:43:29.600 --> 08:43:31.280
Oh

08:43:31.280 --> 08:43:34.320
76 oh my god, how much did wine boosters?

08:43:35.600 --> 08:43:37.600
I thought we were selling like 72

08:43:41.200 --> 08:43:45.440
Wine is faster, but I want to use all the fish that the reeflings gave me

08:43:46.320 --> 08:43:48.320
Because I don't want it to go away

08:43:48.480 --> 08:43:51.360
I don't want it to be like rotting in my in my bank

08:43:56.560 --> 08:43:59.600
Former level and you can cook sharks. Oh

08:44:17.440 --> 08:44:19.440
Um only power

08:44:20.720 --> 08:44:24.880
Only power to bring me back to this gone forsaken game is like cute fish

08:44:27.280 --> 08:44:29.280
It's a good game, but

08:44:30.480 --> 08:44:35.040
If you've got stuff to do, it's not the easiest game to like keep up the excitement

08:44:35.440 --> 08:44:42.880
I think runescape I would say is probably similar to like people say like when you start up a minecraft server, um

08:44:44.560 --> 08:44:49.680
Pardon me and you play for like a week and then you all get burnt out and never go on it again type thing

08:44:51.040 --> 08:44:54.400
Wine got you from 69 to semi-fee feels good, man

08:44:55.280 --> 08:44:57.920
Cooking endangered species when no

08:44:59.840 --> 08:45:04.640
Not cooking endangered species. There's plenty to go around in the runescape economy

08:45:06.000 --> 08:45:08.000
More than enough actually

08:45:08.560 --> 08:45:11.680
In fact, the waters are so infested with shark. They're everywhere

08:45:14.960 --> 08:45:16.960

Rainbow fish

08:45:44.240 --> 08:45:50.080
Okay, I've almost finished eating. I'm so sorry if it feels like I've been chewing for ages. I was too busy getting

No, stop eating. What are you doing?

08:45:58.480 --> 08:46:00.480

Oh my god, sorry, I kind of think I'm just too busy eating

08:46:13.600 --> 08:46:19.440
I'm almost finished eating. I promise I'll finish eating soon. I just take so long to eat

08:46:22.640 --> 08:46:27.360
Walks into an eight hour stream. Thank goodness. I'm not late. I'm gonna

08:46:27.840 --> 08:46:29.840
Okay

08:46:31.440 --> 08:46:33.920
For the architect bros, this one's for you

08:46:34.480 --> 08:46:41.680
I order two meals because I have the second meal the next day. So tomorrow I'll be eating my next meal

08:46:42.880 --> 08:46:44.880
So I'm gonna go put it in the fridge

In the and wash my hands because they're covered in grease. They're covered

08:46:53.360 --> 08:46:55.360
She knows about

So when Azura got released, I read up a little bit and people were like, oh my god architect chocolate and I'm like wait

08:47:02.800 --> 08:47:04.800
I thought you were

08:47:04.800 --> 08:47:10.400
I was like reading. I'm like, okay, right. I get it now. Why architect is such a random word for it though

08:47:13.600 --> 08:47:19.520
I still don't get the origin but hey, oh wait, I'm gonna very quickly wash my hands because they're covered in freaking

08:47:19.520 --> 08:47:26.240
Grease from the burrito that was absolutely inhaling and getting rolled on I'll be literally a millisecond

08:47:49.520 --> 08:47:51.520
So

08:48:19.520 --> 08:48:21.520
So

08:48:39.280 --> 08:48:43.600
I've just stood up and I'm aware of how full my bladder is I'm I'm gonna go pee

08:48:49.520 --> 08:48:51.520
So

08:49:19.520 --> 08:49:21.520
So

08:49:49.520 --> 08:49:51.520
So

08:50:19.520 --> 08:50:21.520
I

08:50:22.880 --> 08:50:24.880

08:50:43.760 --> 08:50:45.760
Okay

08:50:45.760 --> 08:50:47.760
What are we

08:50:48.960 --> 08:50:50.960

08:51:08.560 --> 08:51:10.800
The taskmasker for me

08:51:12.640 --> 08:51:14.640

08:51:16.000 --> 08:51:18.000
For any

08:51:23.200 --> 08:51:25.200
Maybe better streaming hours would help you

08:51:25.680 --> 08:51:28.400
What you mean don't do 12 hours naturally

08:51:29.200 --> 08:51:33.040
What are you talking about refling? Don't say such nonsense

08:51:33.840 --> 08:51:35.840
Are you trying to upset me refling? Huh?

08:51:37.200 --> 08:51:42.160
You're trying to make me feel it's because you left us. Okay. I won't feel sick anymore

08:51:43.120 --> 08:51:45.120

You're laughing but I have separation anxiety with you guys

08:51:50.160 --> 08:51:54.720
It's been getting better, but I feel an immense amount of anxiety

Before I click go live

08:52:00.480 --> 08:52:03.680
And then it goes away when I am live

08:52:04.320 --> 08:52:06.880
I'm not sure what that means. I mean I had it

08:52:07.600 --> 08:52:09.680
last time wink wink, um

08:52:10.640 --> 08:52:13.520
And then it subsided and it was back again

08:52:13.920 --> 08:52:18.000
So I don't know if the plan is it's gonna subside off my body sooner. We love you too

08:52:19.200 --> 08:52:23.280
Hey, scrawny, when are the elden ring streams when the dlc releases?

08:52:24.240 --> 08:52:29.200
You've been playing for a while consider taking a break. Do you insult me jaggex?

08:52:29.600 --> 08:52:36.000
Do you think me some prepubescent child that can't handle a little gaming session?

08:52:36.960 --> 08:52:40.880
Jaggex please do not dare interrupt my flow

08:52:43.440 --> 08:52:45.840
Do you ever get anxiety when it comes to ending streams?

08:52:46.560 --> 08:52:51.920
I get nervous about ending the stream because of what I'm gonna see

08:52:52.640 --> 08:52:58.000
And I know that seems silly because it's like well you say the same every time like I say like I'll see you tomorrow

08:52:58.080 --> 08:53:01.040
Like I love you reflings a few kisses on that

08:53:01.600 --> 08:53:06.240
But I get worried about it and I don't know why I think it's because I am saying goodbye

08:53:06.720 --> 08:53:10.240
And it's like I won't see you until the next time I'm up, you know

08:53:11.360 --> 08:53:13.520
and

08:53:13.520 --> 08:53:15.920
Too much of a grimoire you somehow groomed yourself

08:53:17.680 --> 08:53:21.280
Hey, here at viola, you don't groom us. What are you grooming?

08:53:22.080 --> 08:53:24.720
What I'm what a slogan to have for

08:53:25.520 --> 08:53:28.880
Every time I do that what slogan to have for a visa reasons

08:53:29.120 --> 08:53:31.600
I can't believe I said that out loud with my full check

08:53:32.720 --> 08:53:34.720
Ain't that true though

08:53:35.600 --> 08:53:37.280
Yeah

08:53:37.280 --> 08:53:43.840
Oh when I was lurking someone mentioned that they didn't realize we both have a nicotine patch on us because we're addicted to each other

08:53:44.240 --> 08:53:46.960
It's not for the briefings are addicted to each other. No

08:53:47.520 --> 08:53:49.760
Refling and strongy are addicted to each other

08:53:52.640 --> 08:53:57.760
I can always ramble and procrastinate ending streaming call those for so awkward doing so. Mmm

08:53:59.360 --> 08:54:03.280
Well, like when we reached the 10 hour board mark on that other stream

08:54:03.360 --> 08:54:06.880
I can't even remember what it was the entire ending got caught

08:54:07.360 --> 08:54:12.320
But I was like trying to say so much all at once just because like I wanted to you know

08:54:13.360 --> 08:54:14.560
and

08:54:14.560 --> 08:54:19.440
I wasn't expected to be groomed. I'm glad you did all that sounds terrible when you write that out in a sentence

08:54:19.520 --> 08:54:24.240
I'm going to be honest. It makes me sound like a like a Chris Hansen. Take a seat moment

08:54:26.560 --> 08:54:28.560
Yeah

08:54:28.720 --> 08:54:30.720
Kind of true though. Hey

08:54:31.920 --> 08:54:36.160
I think pre-stream anxiety is normal. You're talking to an auditorium worth of people

08:54:36.640 --> 08:54:41.760
I actually don't get nervous to stream in that sense. Um, it doesn't

08:54:44.000 --> 08:54:47.440
I don't look at the numbers like I don't I don't actually know. Um

08:54:48.560 --> 08:54:54.960
It's not like on display for me. It's just me and reeflings playing multiplayer game. Um

08:54:54.960 --> 08:55:00.720
And that's it like that's what it is. It's not like I'm nervous because I'm gonna have to go perform

08:55:01.200 --> 08:55:08.000
I don't have any kind of imposter syndrome. I don't have any kind of like I'm not good enough

08:55:08.800 --> 08:55:11.600
Um, I just like straight up have separation anxiety

08:55:13.120 --> 08:55:14.560
Um

08:55:14.560 --> 08:55:17.120
And that's it pretty much. Um

08:55:18.320 --> 08:55:24.320
Like I don't get nervous to stream. I don't get like, oh my god. What happens if they don't like it? No, um

08:55:25.520 --> 08:55:27.120
I'm just like

08:55:27.120 --> 08:55:32.720
Just getting out of it. I'm like, oh god. I don't feel well. Like I feel sick. Like my stomach feels ill sometimes

08:55:34.880 --> 08:55:38.720
But like like I've started up streams and I've said to you like oh guys

08:55:38.800 --> 08:55:43.760
It's not gonna be like a long stream today and then it ends up turning into like six hours type thing

08:55:44.480 --> 08:55:48.000
Um, when I only had the intention of two because I wasn't feeling well

08:55:48.000 --> 08:55:51.840
But as soon as I start streaming it's like I get a second burst of wind

08:55:52.480 --> 08:55:57.520
Like I'm super energetic. I'm super engaged and like I'm having like so much fun

08:55:57.600 --> 08:56:02.560
I'm enjoying myself like right now. We're looking at pixels over and over again putting

08:56:03.600 --> 08:56:06.640
Pardon me for being so rude. It was not me. It was my food

08:56:07.680 --> 08:56:11.840
And like I'm having so much fun. Like look at all the reeflings that are in the bank with me right now

08:56:11.920 --> 08:56:13.760
like all of us goofing off and like uh

08:56:14.400 --> 08:56:16.080
Mac

08:56:16.080 --> 08:56:18.720
Macer or maker mac maker

08:56:19.440 --> 08:56:21.440
Thank you for coming to memba

08:56:21.760 --> 08:56:23.760
um

08:56:24.800 --> 08:56:26.800
It's just like

08:56:28.640 --> 08:56:31.600
It's like me with so shiny. I don't want to go out but when I'm out it's fun

08:56:31.840 --> 08:56:36.000
Yeah, it's kind of like getting over the hump if you will and

08:56:38.240 --> 08:56:39.760
And like

08:56:39.760 --> 08:56:41.680
I especially

08:56:41.680 --> 08:56:45.840
Enjoy my endurance streams. Like I kind of spoke on it the other day. Um

08:56:46.240 --> 08:56:47.360
Um

08:56:47.360 --> 08:56:54.080
One time I was having a really bad time and reeflings were just hanging out with me and this isn't now

08:56:54.240 --> 08:56:56.320
This isn't now. This is like way in the past. Um

08:56:57.600 --> 08:57:01.360
And we played a song and it's called mr. Kitty. Um

08:57:02.160 --> 08:57:05.920
I actually like a really depressive song or kind of slow tempo song

08:57:07.040 --> 08:57:11.680
And I heard it and I was listening to and it made me feel a certain way

08:57:11.760 --> 08:57:18.000
It made me feel quite negative. Like it was quite a depressive song mr. Kitty after dark. Yes, that was the song

08:57:18.880 --> 08:57:23.840
And I listened to and I typed and I said is this what you guys feel like all the time

08:57:25.440 --> 08:57:28.480
Because of the way the song had like resonated with me

08:57:28.560 --> 08:57:34.400
It felt as rough as I had felt in that moment because I was feeling rough because you know stuff was going on behind me. Um

08:57:36.080 --> 08:57:39.440
And it kind of like made me realize like

08:57:39.920 --> 08:57:41.040
Like

08:57:41.040 --> 08:57:44.560
If me hanging out having a carry on rambling

08:57:44.960 --> 08:57:51.040
Coming up with all these like silly little ASMR ideas and like all these collab ideas and elaborate stuff and all of that

08:57:51.520 --> 08:57:57.440
And like it makes you not feel like that when I stream like how blessed and how lucky

08:57:58.080 --> 08:58:00.400
like we're on this timeline like

08:58:01.760 --> 08:58:03.760
You know, you can feel

08:58:04.640 --> 08:58:07.920
I don't like accepted to just like do your own thing

08:58:08.000 --> 08:58:14.480
Like I always say the phrase you can be at arm's length. You can be attached at the hip. You can be on my head type thing

08:58:14.480 --> 08:58:17.040
It's completely up to you V Flynn. Um

08:58:18.400 --> 08:58:22.400
But I do remember that night because I was like you guys feel like that like when

08:58:23.440 --> 08:58:26.720
Just in general like you have like such a rough time and then you come

08:58:27.680 --> 08:58:34.400
On stream and like you come and you you make me laugh. You make me giggle. We tell terrible puns while going

08:58:35.200 --> 08:58:36.480
like

08:58:36.480 --> 08:58:38.560
And we're just hanging out type thing

08:58:38.560 --> 08:58:41.520
You know it was like even when like you feel so rough

08:58:41.680 --> 08:58:48.880
You're so willing to like come to me be so accepting of me like say such nice things to me and encourage me to do stuff

08:58:49.840 --> 08:58:54.880
Um and all of that and it's just like it's such like a nice way like hopefully

08:58:55.360 --> 08:58:59.600
I hope it's like a positive feedback loop where you make me giggle

08:58:59.840 --> 08:59:04.800
I make you giggle and like we just have a fun time for what it's worth. Um

08:59:06.800 --> 08:59:09.360
Sometimes you need a song like that to marinate in your thought

08:59:09.520 --> 08:59:15.360
Yeah, like I don't listen to what I consider like sad music in the dumps music or emotional music

08:59:15.600 --> 08:59:20.240
Like I listen to atarashi gako. Um, and like tokyo calling

08:59:20.880 --> 08:59:24.000
Tokyo calling. Um, like I listen to hatsu and miki

08:59:24.000 --> 08:59:26.880
I don't even know what's happening half the time when I listen to hatsu and miki

08:59:27.200 --> 08:59:33.200
But like the music's so upbeat it's so up-pop like I never listen to anything depressive like I like goofy

08:59:34.080 --> 08:59:40.320
Um, like literally I'm listening to a dutch song. I have no idea what's being said other than the lyrics suck my

08:59:41.520 --> 08:59:43.360
um

08:59:43.360 --> 08:59:45.360
type thing, you know

08:59:45.360 --> 08:59:47.360
What was I saying?

08:59:48.480 --> 08:59:55.120
Thanks for the stream strutting. I'm off to watch mercy. Yes. Um any snippets mercy modiste is live and she

08:59:56.000 --> 09:00:01.040
Is playing with my willy. Uh, she's not. Um, maybe in another life

09:00:02.320 --> 09:00:04.320
Um

09:00:04.720 --> 09:00:09.760
Thank god no each one. Uh, right hold on. Let me check hatsu miki has become a legendary figure

09:00:10.640 --> 09:00:14.240
Of making a homework right. Hold on. What is mercy playing?

09:00:14.880 --> 09:00:19.920
Is zura still alive? Azura is still alive. She's playing stream live

09:00:20.720 --> 09:00:24.880
Uh, mercy modiste. Uh, mercy is playing harvester

09:00:26.160 --> 09:00:29.520
Part two. I already knew that because I said that earlier and yet I forgot

09:00:30.160 --> 09:00:32.160
See you brain

09:00:32.160 --> 09:00:34.160
See you brain

09:00:34.880 --> 09:00:36.880
Uh

09:00:40.000 --> 09:00:43.840
I got a comment on the new the asmr video

09:00:45.920 --> 09:00:48.400
And someone's like why is this being recommended to me?

09:00:50.080 --> 09:00:54.480
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you can't resist the asmr

09:00:59.680 --> 09:01:02.720
The most I felt like that after dark was when that

09:01:02.800 --> 09:01:04.800
Um

09:01:05.120 --> 09:01:11.520
When you go in member to a members world, I don't know if we need to do a members world this stream

09:01:11.600 --> 09:01:14.720
It may be next stream. We're doing members world unfortunately

09:01:16.160 --> 09:01:17.920
although

09:01:17.920 --> 09:01:19.920
Wine isn't members is it?

09:01:20.640 --> 09:01:24.000
No, maybe not. I don't know if we're just doing members all the way to the end

09:01:24.880 --> 09:01:28.480
It if we're doing wines all the way to the end people say wines is faster

09:01:29.440 --> 09:01:35.440
I literally get algorithmed. Honestly. What did you miss? I stuffed my face and then

09:01:36.720 --> 09:01:38.720
Let uh

09:01:39.840 --> 09:01:43.280
Let the architect bros know I've got them in the back of my mind

09:01:48.080 --> 09:01:51.280
Um, yeah, hold on. Hold on

09:01:53.280 --> 09:01:57.200
The begging ASMR is peak ASMR. Honestly. Wait, what does it say now?

09:01:58.480 --> 09:02:03.680
It's still going. Oh my god. Is that 23,000 views?

09:02:05.200 --> 09:02:07.200
That doesn't make sense

09:02:08.000 --> 09:02:14.640
Architect bros eating good just like strongy. Honestly. What does it mean architect architect is a

09:02:15.520 --> 09:02:18.160
terminology used for people who enjoy

09:02:19.040 --> 09:02:24.160
bigger body types or eating type of content

09:02:25.120 --> 09:02:30.400
Or gaining weight type of content, but there's different levels to it

09:02:31.120 --> 09:02:37.920
Um, so Azura delays body type because she's not like the default skinny malinky

09:02:38.000 --> 09:02:42.960
I keep opening this freaking collection box. Um, VTuber, so

09:02:44.720 --> 09:02:47.760
She would get referred to as someone for the architect

09:02:48.320 --> 09:02:50.320
Bros

09:02:50.640 --> 09:02:54.560
Look at all the swordfish. They're so purple

09:02:56.400 --> 09:02:58.400
Why are you so purple?

09:02:59.680 --> 09:03:01.680
A

09:03:03.520 --> 09:03:05.520
Specifically vtubers, I think

09:03:07.040 --> 09:03:09.040
She shuffled herself and then

09:03:10.320 --> 09:03:14.640
Yes, uh, again Azura duly is live with a stream

09:03:15.520 --> 09:03:21.280
Hopefully her pc doesn't explode. Um, and merci mondice is playing harvester part two

09:03:21.600 --> 09:03:27.120
Which she never told me there was a part two because I'm getting a highlight reel of part one

09:03:28.000 --> 09:03:31.120
Which isn't going to make any sense if I don't get highlight reel apart

09:03:35.760 --> 09:03:40.160
I love strongy. I love reeflings. What are you going to do about it? Huh? You're going to kiss me on my lips

09:03:41.120 --> 09:03:43.120
You know, let me hold your hand

09:03:43.520 --> 09:03:45.520
Actually, I have something to ask

09:03:45.920 --> 09:03:47.920
The reeflings are

09:03:48.160 --> 09:03:52.160
You guys are like small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. Basically

09:03:53.280 --> 09:03:55.440
Do you guys like that you're smaller than me?

09:03:56.800 --> 09:03:58.800
Or would you like

09:03:59.280 --> 09:04:05.520
A mascot that's like bigger. Oh my god. Why am I struggling so hard with this bank system?

09:04:06.960 --> 09:04:10.640
Um, like you're so nice and tame. Yeah smaller than you is better

09:04:11.360 --> 09:04:18.400
What is my size? Um, I don't even think I have a reference artwork. I can use that isn't toss breaking

09:04:20.800 --> 09:04:21.600
Small is nice

09:04:21.600 --> 09:04:27.360
Yes, you're if you didn't know secret hidden lore for the reeflings your tentacles can grow as long as you like

09:04:27.360 --> 09:04:29.840
So you can interact with things as much as you need

09:04:30.480 --> 09:04:35.680
Um, you have very very long tentacles if you so desire, but they're just nice and cute and stacked together

09:04:35.760 --> 09:04:42.720
Whilst you are in oh my god the crisscross salmon the salmon are going upstream look they're going upstream

09:04:47.920 --> 09:04:53.280
We are growers not sure it's exactly hmm almost like a previous lore strange

09:04:54.320 --> 09:04:59.940
It small means when you cuddle as we feel you every yeah, I can put you in my mouth in my tummy

09:05:00.340 --> 09:05:02.340
Yeah

09:05:03.940 --> 09:05:12.020
Uh, we can go explore strony in the first sense. Hmm should I blindfold reeflings but let your tentacles do what they want?

09:05:14.580 --> 09:05:16.580
Bank boost I'm not going to mess it up this time

09:05:18.900 --> 09:05:20.900
Wow

09:05:22.660 --> 09:05:28.740
Oh, wow, how do I do the fire? Huh? Okay, there we go

09:05:30.580 --> 09:05:35.780
Strony subtly mentioned war. I don't mind it. No, I clearly I like giant ass like war

09:05:37.220 --> 09:05:39.220
um

09:05:40.660 --> 09:05:42.660
What else I like

09:05:43.860 --> 09:05:45.860
Um

09:05:47.220 --> 09:05:50.660
Try to think of other things that are considered like not regular

09:05:53.780 --> 09:05:56.420
Hmm spelunking me no

09:05:57.380 --> 09:05:59.380
Oh

09:05:59.780 --> 09:06:01.780
I can't escape that word

09:06:02.580 --> 09:06:07.860
It's like mongolian throat singing. It's everywhere. It's everywhere. Can't escape it

09:06:08.980 --> 09:06:10.980
No spelunking

09:06:11.220 --> 09:06:13.220
What does it even mean?

09:06:14.500 --> 09:06:21.220
You cannae tell me it's not related to the bedroom spelunking. I can't wait to go spelunking with the reeflings

09:06:22.180 --> 09:06:25.780
Oh, I can't wait until we go into a tight dark

09:06:26.900 --> 09:06:28.500
damp

09:06:28.500 --> 09:06:35.220
Cave and spelunk together like bro. Whoever named spelunking spelunking you knew exactly what you did

09:06:36.900 --> 09:06:39.220
I mean cave exploring. Yeah

09:06:41.300 --> 09:06:43.300
I literally

09:06:44.420 --> 09:06:49.860
You've ever heard such a more ridiculous word. How dare they make such a word

09:06:51.300 --> 09:06:53.460
Oh my god, you're still doing absolutely

09:06:55.060 --> 09:06:57.060
Wakey wakey sleepyhead

09:06:58.260 --> 09:07:05.620
Goodnight Strony send luck to my country tomorrow. I have no idea what your country's doing tomorrow, but please don't perish if it's bad

09:07:08.020 --> 09:07:10.020
Good luck to your country

09:07:10.180 --> 09:07:15.220
And rest well for anyone who do need to sleep. Please don't worry. We are literally just

09:07:15.940 --> 09:07:19.300
going for another three hours and then

09:07:21.540 --> 09:07:22.900
Uh

09:07:22.900 --> 09:07:27.380
We'll redirect into a streamer. I don't know who I don't even know who's not online normally at this time

09:07:28.100 --> 09:07:32.260
Uh, but we will find a vtuber that is live that we can redirect into

09:07:33.060 --> 09:07:39.780
The euro cup fitba is on the new all right. Okay, right. Good luck. Uh, I am down for some spelunking right now

09:07:40.500 --> 09:07:47.220
Uh, plunging is another fun one plunging. Please don't plunge me. That's not abysmal

09:07:47.460 --> 09:07:49.460
Hmm

09:07:49.700 --> 09:07:51.700
Spelunking in the cave of a giant ass

09:07:52.500 --> 09:07:56.500
I don't know how to have far to go with the giant ass and the zero

09:07:56.580 --> 09:08:00.420
I might not make her do the weird side of things. I may do the weird side of things

09:08:04.500 --> 09:08:06.500
But yeah

09:08:10.020 --> 09:08:12.660
No, no plunging not even a little

09:08:13.380 --> 09:08:20.100
You can plug me up. Whoa. Wait, hold on. I was like so direct. My brain was like, oh

09:08:20.820 --> 09:08:28.260
This'll this is fine. This is clearly beating around the bush. Nope. No, it's not. It's absolutely not. I just straight upset what

09:08:29.140 --> 09:08:31.140
what I uh

09:08:32.100 --> 09:08:36.260
Sorry, you know, actually I can tell you something that was really terrible

09:08:36.260 --> 09:08:42.340
So if all the development issues hadn't occurred, I actually

09:08:43.220 --> 09:08:44.420
fully

09:08:44.420 --> 09:08:46.420
was going to

09:08:48.740 --> 09:08:49.620
Are you squinting me?

09:08:49.620 --> 09:08:54.420
Uh, hold on. I don't know what you think. Giant ass for content one day totally

09:08:54.980 --> 09:08:56.980
Ah

09:08:57.140 --> 09:09:02.340
I'm freaking happy to make it anonymous. It doesn't bother me. Like I like it. I don't mind at all. Um

09:09:03.300 --> 09:09:06.180
I don't like the you die ones. I don't like that

09:09:06.340 --> 09:09:10.260
I like the ones where you just kind of appear on the other end all fine and good

09:09:10.420 --> 09:09:13.860
And maybe a bit moody because you accidentally got swallowed or something like that

09:09:14.660 --> 09:09:16.100
um

09:09:16.100 --> 09:09:18.500
She's letting the intrusive thoughts went honestly though

09:09:19.140 --> 09:09:26.260
This is terrible. So if all the development issues didn't happen all the girls were posting like all these audios on twitter and I was like

09:09:26.900 --> 09:09:32.420
Uh, I should probably do one as well. But like after debut and I thought wouldn't it not be really

09:09:33.460 --> 09:09:35.300
terrible if

09:09:35.300 --> 09:09:37.300
I may or may not have been

09:09:39.860 --> 09:09:41.860
PLug

09:09:42.500 --> 09:09:48.260
Uh during like debut and after and then once the stream ended I would go record

09:09:48.900 --> 09:09:54.980
and like do something with it and then finish and then post it and you know

09:09:55.540 --> 09:10:00.020
So that was my idea. But obviously that all crumbled apart. Thanks to development issues. Um

09:10:01.940 --> 09:10:03.940
But yeah, I thought it would be pretty cute

09:10:05.060 --> 09:10:06.260
But

09:10:06.260 --> 09:10:10.580
That would have been amazing. Unfortunately. It's not possible. It's not possible

09:10:11.540 --> 09:10:16.340
And there was so many developmental issues in time and I could absolutely strangle some people

09:10:16.420 --> 09:10:18.420
But that's just what happens like literally

09:10:19.140 --> 09:10:23.780
Um, oh, sorry. There was a refling that messaged me that apologized for

09:10:24.500 --> 09:10:27.540
criticizing the company for saying like, oh, it'd be better if

09:10:28.340 --> 09:10:35.940
The girls could make their designs. Please don't feel bad. I absolutely completely get where you come from. Um,

09:10:36.500 --> 09:10:37.620
just for

09:10:37.620 --> 09:10:39.620
How do I keep doing that?

09:10:39.620 --> 09:10:41.620
I give up. Um

09:10:41.700 --> 09:10:48.100
Please don't feel bad about saying that like you said it in a nice way. We had some negative criticism that was like

09:10:48.580 --> 09:10:52.820
Oh pre-made model. Actually one of the most bizarre criticisms we got

09:10:53.460 --> 09:10:55.460
um was

09:10:56.100 --> 09:11:00.100
What was it? It was like, oh, they don't even have talents ready

09:11:00.740 --> 09:11:04.500
When we opened up auditions and it was like, yeah, you're fucking Egypt

09:11:04.740 --> 09:11:08.340
We didn't have talents. So we're opening auditions like every other Vtuber agency

09:11:08.580 --> 09:11:10.020
But when we do it, it's bad

09:11:10.020 --> 09:11:12.900
But when everyone else does it, it's fine and that was like, what?

09:11:13.540 --> 09:11:16.740
It was the most bizarre thing I had ever read honestly

09:11:18.340 --> 09:11:20.340
um

09:11:20.420 --> 09:11:28.020
We have plenty of time for a future fun. Well, literally opened up auditions and someone was like, what if she'd be 2.0 look like this?

09:11:29.300 --> 09:11:32.180
I mean, she's getting an update to our model. I don't know how much she's said

09:11:32.260 --> 09:11:35.540
I'm not gonna say anything if she doesn't say anything. I'm not gonna say anything

09:11:36.020 --> 09:11:39.860
Thank you for the tip as well anonymous. Sorry. I almost forget to thank you

09:11:41.300 --> 09:11:44.820
Um, I won't say anything until she be says something but

09:11:45.220 --> 09:11:47.220
Yeah

09:11:48.420 --> 09:11:50.420
Outfit she said outfit

09:11:54.500 --> 09:11:59.540
Right, I'll I'll leave it at that if she's not directly said what it is. I'm not gonna say

09:12:00.580 --> 09:12:02.580
She said outfit

09:12:05.140 --> 09:12:09.620
Uh, we don't have workers because we're not open yet many baffled honestly

09:12:10.260 --> 09:12:14.900
It was bizarre like I remember reading it actually there's a reflin

09:12:15.380 --> 09:12:17.380
It must have been a reflin

09:12:17.460 --> 09:12:21.300
It must have been a reflin because you made me he haul my arse off

09:12:22.100 --> 09:12:26.660
And I can remember the quote because I used to quote it because someone defended the agency

09:12:27.060 --> 09:12:31.220
They must I think they're a reflin or possibly just someone who's enthusiastic about the girls in general

09:12:31.780 --> 09:12:34.820
So someone criticized the company because they were like

09:12:35.540 --> 09:12:37.220
Oh

09:12:37.220 --> 09:12:43.140
Another agency where you have to give up your model to work with them and get their their pre-made models or whatever

09:12:43.780 --> 09:12:47.140
And then someone commented and replied to them and there was like

09:12:47.860 --> 09:12:53.300
No one wants your ugly as sin model like that was to the quote your ugly as sin model

09:12:53.940 --> 09:12:55.300
Oh

09:12:55.300 --> 09:12:58.900
I wish I could have interacted with it because it made me he

09:12:59.460 --> 09:13:04.100
Ha so badly is that no one wants your ugly as sin model

09:13:04.900 --> 09:13:06.900
Oh, my god

09:13:07.220 --> 09:13:08.020
I

09:13:08.020 --> 09:13:15.220
Literally was like getting so close to printing that out and putting it on my fridge because it was just so hilarious to me

09:13:15.300 --> 09:13:17.300
Like it was so hilarious

09:13:18.020 --> 09:13:20.020
um

09:13:20.020 --> 09:13:22.020
Like I just oh my god

09:13:23.140 --> 09:13:25.140
um

09:13:25.140 --> 09:13:31.460
It vin miss vin san vin san vin sin vin sin

09:13:32.420 --> 09:13:36.580
Vincent thank you for becoming a member that took me so long to figure out. I'm so sorry

09:13:37.140 --> 09:13:39.140
No, not sin sister

09:13:39.140 --> 09:13:42.100
It was just the terminology the guy used because someone was like

09:13:42.500 --> 09:13:48.260
Oh, I don't want to give up my model type thing and I don't want this. I don't want that like basically complaining about the agency

09:13:48.260 --> 09:13:51.140
And it was like rub one you've not even applied to you're not interested

09:13:51.140 --> 09:13:57.060
So three shut the fuck up and then some reflin or just someone who was a good fan come swooping in

09:13:57.540 --> 09:14:03.140
And replies what I was basically thinking no one wants your ugliest sin model and I'm like

09:14:03.940 --> 09:14:05.940
It's so good

09:14:06.100 --> 09:14:13.060
It's so funny. Anyway, so you made my day whoever whoever like came swooping under to defend the agency you have made my day

09:14:13.140 --> 09:14:14.020
um

09:14:14.020 --> 09:14:21.300
Hellscape. Thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate it the membership stream start next week. Uh, you've got plenty

09:14:22.260 --> 09:14:27.060
Uh, it's a bit warm not gonna lie a bit hot in here. Yeah, but it's a bit sweaty out here

09:14:27.620 --> 09:14:29.940
Surprise the bank hasn't caught on fire. Honestly

09:14:30.980 --> 09:14:32.420
um

09:14:32.420 --> 09:14:35.700
Forgive her. She's tired and forgot how to read. Oh, no, what did I miss me?

09:14:36.260 --> 09:14:38.500
Oh, what are you yapping about strongy? She be cooking

09:14:39.380 --> 09:14:44.260
So I think she be has allured to something which I'm more than happy for her to

09:14:44.980 --> 09:14:50.020
Um, but I don't think she's fully said what it is and I don't want to ruin it because it's quite a nice thing

09:14:50.100 --> 09:14:54.340
I think it's quite a nice thing and it's like the most basic common courtesy thing. Um

09:14:55.380 --> 09:14:57.380
Allured she be alert to it

09:14:58.820 --> 09:15:00.820
There were some abysmally

09:15:01.540 --> 09:15:03.540
stupid takes on a flume

09:15:04.980 --> 09:15:08.020
It's just the way the guy typed the message

09:15:09.460 --> 09:15:15.060
I just constantly remember the phrase ugly as sin model. I was like, oh my god

09:15:15.860 --> 09:15:24.180
Talk about like catching screwy like oh my god. I don't think I could recover if someone was like your ugliest sin model

09:15:27.060 --> 09:15:29.860
Oh my god, love it. Love it. Love it. Love it

09:15:31.780 --> 09:15:37.700
Then mummy you have broken youtube. We are going for 6.1 subs. Oh my god

09:15:39.220 --> 09:15:41.860
The video was the video honestly that funny

09:15:42.340 --> 09:15:47.220
I'm like, I'm second guessing myself. I'm like, what's the video truly that entertaining

09:15:47.220 --> 09:15:51.780
Like I was just kind of seen please a lot by the end of it and started like breathing in the mic really weird

09:15:52.980 --> 09:15:56.900
I only know one agency that lets their talents pick their models literally

09:15:57.940 --> 09:16:00.420
I've only heard one other agency do it as well

09:16:01.380 --> 09:16:03.380
um

09:16:03.380 --> 09:16:08.900
But I'm quite happy for the girls like to design their 2.0 like emmy designed her 2.0 like I'm more than happy

09:16:08.900 --> 09:16:13.780
If she wants that makes her happier and all that then juice. What am I gonna fucking say about it? Nothing

09:16:14.500 --> 09:16:16.980
Oh guys as long as the girls are happy. They're happy. Um

09:16:18.260 --> 09:16:20.260
I made mommy ink herself

09:16:20.260 --> 09:16:23.220
Has my whole life been a mistake. Is this peak content for you from?

09:16:24.740 --> 09:16:29.300
Uh, also the amount of people that could not read. Oh, I felt so bad

09:16:30.100 --> 09:16:32.980
Actually, we had one japanese girl

09:16:33.380 --> 09:16:36.100
Um apply and I felt so bad

09:16:36.580 --> 09:16:38.580
Because she had such a lovely voice

09:16:38.660 --> 09:16:44.820
But she could hardly speak any english and I was like, it's not gonna work. It's such a shame

09:16:45.540 --> 09:16:48.420
She had worked for a previous agency

09:16:49.060 --> 09:16:51.060
um

09:16:51.060 --> 09:16:58.100
And I think google translate was helping her through the page and she inquired on the website and I felt so bad being like

09:16:58.980 --> 09:17:02.660
Bro, you can't speak english. I can't have you there was actually a russian

09:17:03.300 --> 09:17:08.900
Person that reached out as well. She was like, I know you I know your agency's english

09:17:09.140 --> 09:17:13.060
But can I stream in russian and have a russian audience and I'm like

09:17:13.700 --> 09:17:21.060
Ah, yes, let us the english vtuber agency come out with talents that where I can't even like moderate what you're doing or saying like

09:17:21.220 --> 09:17:22.420
what

09:17:22.420 --> 09:17:25.860
Some folk had like don't get me wrong. We're lenient, but

09:17:26.820 --> 09:17:29.460
We do have to say like that's not even possible

09:17:30.180 --> 09:17:32.980
Like what you're asking for isn't even possible

09:17:34.180 --> 09:17:35.860
um

09:17:35.860 --> 09:17:42.180
It was a shame. I loved emi's 2.0 design. I'm glad. I'm glad. I think she had a lot of fun design in her 2.0

09:17:43.220 --> 09:17:44.340
um

09:17:44.340 --> 09:17:46.340
so, yeah

09:17:46.740 --> 09:17:49.620
How good was good as application? What?

09:17:50.580 --> 09:17:57.460
Good is still a thingy. Oh, you want to trade with me? Hold on. Let me put my swordfish away. I'll trade with you. What's up?

09:17:58.340 --> 09:18:00.340
What's up low leaflin?

09:18:02.180 --> 09:18:05.220
Uh, maybe oh, it's so what is this?

09:18:06.980 --> 09:18:08.980
Are these doughnuts to put around your

09:18:10.580 --> 09:18:15.620
disc of returning disc of returning yellow boots yellow gloves. What?

09:18:15.620 --> 09:18:17.620
Huh?

09:18:17.940 --> 09:18:19.940
What have you given me? What does it look like?

09:18:20.420 --> 09:18:22.660
activity

09:18:22.660 --> 09:18:24.660
You can only enter

09:18:24.660 --> 09:18:27.780
Thor dors black hole from the dwarven mains

09:18:28.980 --> 09:18:33.860
Are you sitting literally? I thought this is a weebie ring as well. Are you giving me your weebie ring?

09:18:35.380 --> 09:18:37.380
Am I putting shoes on?

09:18:38.020 --> 09:18:40.020
Okay, I got shoes on

09:18:40.020 --> 09:18:42.020
I got gloves on

09:18:42.340 --> 09:18:49.300
Oh, now I look like I really work. I think it's a helpful tool that'll come in handy later. That's so ominous

09:18:49.860 --> 09:18:52.580
This is a helpful tool that'll help you later. What do you mean?

09:18:53.380 --> 09:18:56.020
That's so ominous. What am I supposed to do about that?

09:19:00.180 --> 09:19:01.460
I

09:19:01.460 --> 09:19:04.100
Get you miss 100% of the shots, but some people

09:19:04.980 --> 09:19:10.180
Just don't get it. It was a shame like I felt really bad for the Japanese girl

09:19:10.180 --> 09:19:12.900
She was nothing but polite well mannered

09:19:13.940 --> 09:19:16.260
Um, and like obviously I can't say too much of the message

09:19:16.260 --> 09:19:20.180
But basically she'd worked in another agency before it didn't work out

09:19:20.820 --> 09:19:26.740
Um, and she was like really excited at the prospect and she already had all the experience type thing

09:19:27.460 --> 09:19:30.500
But she just couldn't speak English and I can't be like

09:19:31.540 --> 09:19:37.860
Given lead script examples where she mimics what I'm saying because then she's gonna end up just sounding like me type thing

09:19:37.860 --> 09:19:43.220
When it comes to trying to mix it was a shame. It was a shame because it would have been a very interesting mix

09:19:47.860 --> 09:19:53.460
You can stack donuts on it Japanese branch went no, there will be no spin-offs

09:19:54.580 --> 09:19:56.980
absolutely no spin-offs that feel or

09:19:58.100 --> 09:19:59.380
um

09:19:59.380 --> 09:20:06.580
I am I am three gens and I am done. I have nothing else to produce or give to this beautiful world

09:20:06.740 --> 09:20:08.740
I will give my daughters

09:20:09.060 --> 09:20:10.580
um

09:20:10.580 --> 09:20:16.980
My gen one my gen two my gen three and I am done. I cannot handle anymore. I am I'm at capacity

09:20:17.380 --> 09:20:19.380
There is too much lights off

09:20:19.540 --> 09:20:23.620
Plappening happen. I can't keep up with you as refluence. I can't keep up with you

09:20:24.340 --> 09:20:25.300
um

09:20:25.300 --> 09:20:30.580
Someone was worried about a male branch. I assure you that male branch idea is dead in the ditch

09:20:30.660 --> 09:20:32.660
I am not even touching it with a 10-foot pole

09:20:33.940 --> 09:20:35.940
um

09:20:36.580 --> 09:20:39.140
Someone asked I did get a few inquiries

09:20:39.700 --> 09:20:44.500
On the website saying are you interested in doing a safer work branch?

09:20:45.220 --> 09:20:47.220
The answer is no

09:20:47.700 --> 09:20:50.020
I don't mean to sound so blunt with that

09:20:50.980 --> 09:20:51.940
But the answer is no

09:20:51.940 --> 09:20:57.700
You might as well go to any other agency go apply to any other agency if you're if you're interested in the safer work

09:20:57.860 --> 09:21:01.620
The reason why you don't get such a good cut in other agencies is because they're greedy cons

09:21:01.620 --> 09:21:05.060
But that's okay though because you know is what it is and they point and

09:21:05.940 --> 09:21:07.940
They point and beat around the bush

09:21:07.940 --> 09:21:09.940
They point and beat around the bush

09:21:10.740 --> 09:21:12.100
and

09:21:12.100 --> 09:21:18.100
Safer work branch kind of defeats the purpose literally like at that point might as well just start like

09:21:19.540 --> 09:21:23.060
A whole different agency and all that jazz

09:21:25.220 --> 09:21:30.020
But I am done. I have experienced it. It's been fun

09:21:30.580 --> 09:21:34.740
Um Vila is my child and so are my daughters

09:21:35.380 --> 09:21:40.020
And the reeflings are the father and I'm also pregnant with the reeflings for that asmr

09:21:40.180 --> 09:21:42.580
And I forgot to commission that art. I've still not done it

09:21:44.660 --> 09:21:46.660
Vila to electric boogaloo

09:21:47.460 --> 09:21:51.140
But strongy with enough power you can reignite even a dying star

09:21:52.820 --> 09:21:56.340
No latin american branch. No, I cannot do any

09:21:57.300 --> 09:22:03.540
Uh alternative language speaking branches because I don't speak the language and I

09:22:04.740 --> 09:22:10.580
Don't have any trusted advisors that I could overwhelm with the amount of work it takes

09:22:11.060 --> 09:22:12.340
um

09:22:12.340 --> 09:22:18.900
Like the split couldn't be as high if I needed someone on call 24 7 to translate what these girls are trying to

09:22:19.380 --> 09:22:22.820
Say to me like it's just it's not possible. It's not possible

09:22:23.380 --> 09:22:27.620
Or it's not possible for me possible for other agencies. Not yourself out, but

09:22:28.180 --> 09:22:33.860
After three gents. I am done. I am helping the girls achieve their dreams as much as possible at that point

09:22:33.940 --> 09:22:35.940
I have no interested in

09:22:36.340 --> 09:22:44.740
Trying to infinitely expand and have a billion talents out of ones and no, that's just no it's so disrespectful as well to the

09:22:45.620 --> 09:22:50.820
To the girls um just being like oh, but we're already throwing out the next gen some mailers

09:22:50.980 --> 09:22:56.660
I'm broke. Oh, wait. Sorry. Sorry. Refling was trade. I'm sorry. Refling. Hold on. Let me trade. Let me put this away

09:22:58.580 --> 09:23:00.580
Oh, sorry

09:23:03.220 --> 09:23:05.700
No refling branch. What is that?

09:23:07.780 --> 09:23:09.780
What even is that?

09:23:10.420 --> 09:23:12.900
Moles? Wait, why is it a million?

09:23:15.300 --> 09:23:17.300
What are you doing?

09:23:18.180 --> 09:23:20.180
uh

09:23:20.340 --> 09:23:22.340
The drip the drip

09:23:23.140 --> 09:23:27.220
Other players accepted wait, you're giving me a million dollar

09:23:27.940 --> 09:23:31.140
Million gp freaking what is it?

09:23:32.260 --> 09:23:34.260
Oh

09:23:34.260 --> 09:23:36.260
Oh, emi's not gonna like that

09:23:37.780 --> 09:23:39.780
emi's gonna have a word with that

09:23:40.900 --> 09:23:43.620
Oh, those are awful. Do you want these back?

09:23:44.900 --> 09:23:49.220
I gotta be honest chief. I think you can have these back here. Let me trade accept trade

09:23:49.220 --> 09:23:51.220
Wait, how do I go back on the trade?

09:23:51.940 --> 09:23:57.220
How do I get you flip flops? Wait, how do I give it back? I don't want them. They're scary

09:23:59.860 --> 09:24:04.580
Emi's gonna be mad. Do you want it back? Where are you? I can't see you. Are you on me?

09:24:06.260 --> 09:24:11.860
Oh, there you are. Here you go. You take them back. Oh, no, you're busy in the bank. Oh

09:24:13.300 --> 09:24:15.300
Just sell it for more way in

09:24:16.260 --> 09:24:22.420
Honestly vealer has me really wanting to become a you're cool and I wish I could do the same sort of stuff

09:24:23.060 --> 09:24:26.180
Um, if you're a guy, unfortunately, I don't have much of you

09:24:27.700 --> 09:24:31.700
But do you really not want these back? Where are you?

09:24:33.780 --> 09:24:36.260
Trade give me take these things back

09:24:38.660 --> 09:24:40.660
Definitely just sell it have like four of them

09:24:41.620 --> 09:24:46.020
Via lure s on I can't I know how blow espagnol me

09:24:46.820 --> 09:24:49.860
Hey, you know me casa to casa

09:24:51.460 --> 09:24:56.180
Johnny la chanta is the more local right I've yanked the shoes they're mine now. Sorry

09:24:57.380 --> 09:25:00.340
Never give a minecraft hole your diamonds

09:25:01.540 --> 09:25:04.740
Or she runs away with your mall shoes and runescape

09:25:05.460 --> 09:25:09.780
Oh, you're still streaming. Why are you sick of me already?

09:25:22.020 --> 09:25:25.700
Please rest well. Yes. Anyone who needs to sleep, please rest well

09:25:26.420 --> 09:25:29.380
We are doing a cheeky endurance today. So if you think you can

09:25:30.180 --> 09:25:32.180
Hold on for another two hours

09:25:32.260 --> 09:25:34.260
Then

09:25:34.500 --> 09:25:36.500
If not, then

09:25:37.300 --> 09:25:40.260
Sick from how sweet your streams are too much sugar make to me her

09:25:41.700 --> 09:25:43.940
Yeah, I was like la chanta is the more local

09:25:46.340 --> 09:25:48.980
And then there is that other one free those rats

09:25:50.020 --> 09:25:54.900
Which is oh no free those rats. There's a me. Oh, she's shaking her hand at us

09:25:57.700 --> 09:25:59.940
Why I order looking stance

09:26:02.180 --> 09:26:05.140
At least this 30 minutes left for me. Maybe not much more though

09:26:32.980 --> 09:26:38.580
You're gonna have to use hypnosis. Wait, I don't want to sleep though, but it's good for your health

09:26:40.580 --> 09:26:42.580
Can't do it. It's evil

09:26:43.700 --> 09:26:48.340
Fuck you. You tangled me. I tangled you. That was even ASMR. I was just me man

09:26:49.700 --> 09:26:51.700
singing a little lullaby

09:26:52.660 --> 09:26:53.700
I

09:26:53.700 --> 09:26:59.460
Was streaming when I came a bed now I wake up and I can continue watching hell. Yeah

09:27:01.700 --> 09:27:03.700
All of a sudden I feel super hyper

09:27:03.700 --> 09:27:06.900
Well after the lullaby my favorite saying apologies if I butcher it

09:27:07.700 --> 09:27:09.700
Oh as if I can read that

09:27:09.940 --> 09:27:11.940
No, I'm trying to book

09:27:12.980 --> 09:27:14.980
Serada

09:27:17.140 --> 09:27:23.460
Flies do not enter a close mouth. Damn. They really said loose lips sink ships. I can't believe it

09:27:24.100 --> 09:27:26.100
You almost got me

09:27:26.100 --> 09:27:32.180
It was lovely though. Oh your whispers can tingle alone. I'll bet you like my whispers

09:27:32.180 --> 09:27:34.180
I

09:27:52.340 --> 09:27:55.620
I didn't mention then just made me imagine you as Gengar

09:27:55.620 --> 09:27:57.620
Yeah

09:28:00.260 --> 09:28:02.260
Gengar the epinosis

09:28:05.140 --> 09:28:11.940
Might be the lullaby or the two kilograms of cocaine or just no, no, I'll sleep when moma sleeps

09:28:13.620 --> 09:28:15.620
Just so lovely. Thank you. Thank you

09:28:17.620 --> 09:28:22.420
When the stream ends emi and ac's memberships are gonna go

09:28:22.900 --> 09:28:30.500
Live because I'm gonna put them live because I'm such a good little streamer

09:28:32.740 --> 09:28:34.740
Such a good little streamer

09:28:35.780 --> 09:28:38.100
It's dreamer. No, let me be a streamer

09:28:39.780 --> 09:28:41.780
Manager, no, I'm a little manager

09:28:42.420 --> 09:28:49.140
I just do the intern work and it keeps the stress off of them as long as the girl stress levels are low

09:28:50.020 --> 09:28:52.420
And I will I will be very happy

09:28:59.700 --> 09:29:06.180
The point is to consume hypno content so much it conditions you it will work eventually to me over a decade from when I

09:29:06.420 --> 09:29:08.980
became interested in color felt my first return

09:29:11.780 --> 09:29:13.780
It was drowsy

09:29:14.740 --> 09:29:18.740
Yeah, I will my bed team is

09:29:19.460 --> 09:29:25.220
5 p.m. Actually, it's 1 p.m. Right now and we've still got another

09:29:26.580 --> 09:29:28.580
Two and a half hours. Yeah

09:29:30.740 --> 09:29:32.740
So then that would take me to

09:29:34.420 --> 09:29:38.020
4 p.m. So I have one hour basically to do all the

09:29:38.660 --> 09:29:43.300
Stuff that I'm supposed to do. Um, and then I pass out

09:29:43.780 --> 09:29:48.340
And then when I wake up I prepare for stream with a cup of honey tea

09:29:48.740 --> 09:29:53.780
And then I open up crash bandicoot warped and make sure you guys can hear it and see it

09:29:54.340 --> 09:30:01.780
And then we go again. Um, I believe tomorrow is eight hour stream. It's not endurance to finish the game. It's eight hours

09:30:04.100 --> 09:30:07.140
Would it be mean to let you know you're 10% of the way to 99?

09:30:07.140 --> 09:30:09.140
I

09:30:12.740 --> 09:30:14.740
What

09:30:16.340 --> 09:30:18.340
10% of the way

09:30:20.580 --> 09:30:24.500
I thought I could get it finished this month. I don't think so

09:30:28.420 --> 09:30:30.420
10% there. Oh, yay

09:30:33.700 --> 09:30:36.020
Do you want to know the amount of xp required?

09:30:37.620 --> 09:30:39.620
It's 13 million. Oh, I'm

09:30:40.900 --> 09:30:45.860
10% of the way that so every million is like, I guess

09:30:47.620 --> 09:30:51.460
Well, 1.3% is every million wait

09:30:52.500 --> 09:30:54.500
Every million is 10.3%

09:30:56.020 --> 09:30:59.060
Surely that's how it works. Is that how math works?

09:31:01.700 --> 09:31:03.700
Break it down into chunks. Um

09:31:04.420 --> 09:31:09.780
9 to 8 to 99 is like 1.2 million. Oh my god

09:31:11.220 --> 09:31:15.860
Peanut the force is here. You should be able to do it

09:31:18.020 --> 09:31:22.900
Every 1.3 million is 10% okay, so we're just over 10% now

09:31:23.700 --> 09:31:28.100
Okay, that's not bad. We'll finish the sword fish

09:31:28.740 --> 09:31:32.820
I think we can finish the sword fish before the end of the stream and then

09:31:33.940 --> 09:31:38.980
We'll tackle wine. I'm going to buy a bunch of wine stuff

09:31:39.620 --> 09:31:42.740
And we're basically gonna watch a movie

09:31:44.980 --> 09:31:48.420
While we do it so we can all giggle and laugh at movie

09:31:49.300 --> 09:31:51.540
Um, I think we'll do john wick

09:31:52.980 --> 09:31:56.100
This is perfect zatsu content and rambling. Yeah

09:31:56.980 --> 09:32:01.380
I did look at marshmallow. I don't know if I have many more marshmallows a lot of the marshmallows

09:32:01.380 --> 09:32:05.380
I can't really read for obvious reason because reeflings are a little

09:32:07.940 --> 09:32:10.180
Okay, let me check if there are any more

09:32:11.460 --> 09:32:13.460
Marchmallows

09:32:13.460 --> 09:32:17.620
Oh, okay, definitely a few more marshmallows. Hold on. Let's go. Uh

09:32:21.220 --> 09:32:24.740
Oh, no, are you guys berating me because I lost four in a row?

09:32:28.900 --> 09:32:30.900
Uh

09:32:32.340 --> 09:32:34.340
Uh

09:32:36.100 --> 09:32:38.820
I was split between giving my veal or membership

09:32:40.260 --> 09:32:42.760
Cherry to emmy or to mercy

09:32:43.460 --> 09:32:48.180
Because each of the girls are intense young dairies and don't want their fans to flirt with other girls

09:32:48.660 --> 09:32:53.700
Then I remembered all the good times from hanging in your stream and I saw the third option you me

09:32:53.940 --> 09:32:56.180
No, you're supposed to support my daughters

09:32:56.740 --> 09:33:02.100
Strong eat sometimes during or after emmy's membership opening. I'm going to make a decision. You're a strong prick

09:33:02.260 --> 09:33:04.260
I won't overlook you when deciding

09:33:04.420 --> 09:33:08.740
Reefling or or pinpal or snippet whatever one you may be

09:33:09.300 --> 09:33:13.860
Um, please always support my daughters over me if you can only support one at a time

09:33:14.500 --> 09:33:22.100
Um, please pick either daughter if you struggle to pick between a daughter pick the design the default design

09:33:22.180 --> 09:33:23.860
You like the most

09:33:23.860 --> 09:33:28.180
That's the easiest the most simplistic way to do it because your brain will either go

09:33:28.340 --> 09:33:32.020
I like this design the most or I like that. Oh my god. I thought Gimli was in the room there

09:33:32.420 --> 09:33:36.340
I had a heart attack. I was getting nervous about spiders. Uh, I don't like them

09:33:36.740 --> 09:33:43.860
Um, I'm also just a spider like a working in the room. Can we add pictures or videos to marshmallows? Um, you can via

09:33:44.660 --> 09:33:46.660
cat box

09:33:46.900 --> 09:33:48.660
um

09:33:48.660 --> 09:33:53.620
If you want to show me something you have to do the link and you have to make it easy

09:33:54.340 --> 09:33:56.340
Just remove the dot

09:33:56.500 --> 09:34:01.300
And put dot in brackets because if you do it any other way, I'm too paprika and can't open it off

09:34:01.380 --> 09:34:04.820
It's literally a logic puzzle to open up a link when you don't give me the link

09:34:06.660 --> 09:34:12.660
It's okay strongy. We'll comfort you after this losses. They're there head pads. Good girl. Hey, wait didn't

09:34:13.460 --> 09:34:16.660
Did you want us to help with those frustrations? Would you like to be on?

09:34:16.740 --> 09:34:20.900
Whoa, I can't read that. Whoa, I can't read that

09:34:27.060 --> 09:34:29.060
Okay

09:34:31.860 --> 09:34:36.020
Can you read that in lads can you read that in? Hey, that's uh, that's the offline

09:34:36.740 --> 09:34:40.100
That's the offline one. You know what I'm saying? That's that's that's between me and offline

09:34:41.860 --> 09:34:44.180
Uh, right. Let me let me scroll down to the next one

09:34:45.140 --> 09:34:48.740
Hey strongy, just wanted to thank for all the fun streams. You're welcome. We've been

09:34:49.380 --> 09:34:55.060
I've especially enjoyed your ASMR streams. Your voice and accent are just so pleasant to listen to. I you like that

09:34:55.140 --> 09:34:57.140
I bet you do

09:34:57.460 --> 09:35:00.500
I also look forward to the fun ways that you plan to mind break it. Oh

09:35:01.380 --> 09:35:03.380
It's coming

09:35:03.460 --> 09:35:07.140
Hope you and the girls are having a great time and go far with your content

09:35:07.220 --> 09:35:10.420
Bruv, we're all in cloud nine like all of us are so happy

09:35:10.980 --> 09:35:15.300
Um our monetization streams are about to be done me and mercy are done

09:35:15.940 --> 09:35:20.260
Icy and emmy are next then it's she be

09:35:20.900 --> 09:35:24.420
Then it should be a zero whenever it gets granted. I feel like it should happen now

09:35:24.740 --> 09:35:31.860
I'm sorry strongy, but I choose you. You speak to me on a whole another level. I love you. Kamiyoshi. No, you can't call me kamiyoshi

09:35:34.660 --> 09:35:39.540
Will you do more twitter mosaic responses to the marshmallows? Yes, I've been wanting to do it

09:35:40.020 --> 09:35:43.940
And update it terribly terribly badly for a long time

09:35:44.180 --> 09:35:49.220
Because I really enjoy writing the scenarios to you guys like when you guys give me like a little prompt or something

09:35:49.700 --> 09:35:52.980
And I just take it way too far. It's my favorite thing to do

09:35:55.140 --> 09:35:58.420
Yes, I will definitely be doing that again soon. It's just

09:35:59.140 --> 09:36:05.780
Every I say this every stream as the dust settles and all the little mini side projects get pushed out the way

09:36:06.020 --> 09:36:10.660
Then I can start to like really catch up because like whenever I do those two-hour streams

09:36:10.900 --> 09:36:17.380
I'm catching up and like I'm literally going to the doctors after buckshot roulette and then I'll be healing up for a bit

09:36:18.180 --> 09:36:20.180
um

09:36:20.580 --> 09:36:22.180
so

09:36:22.180 --> 09:36:28.420
ASMR with the viewer viewer beats you in a board game a bunch till we let you win and so then

09:36:28.580 --> 09:36:31.780
Spacey time to celebrate the victory. Honestly, that's quite funny

09:36:32.660 --> 09:36:34.660
um

09:36:35.620 --> 09:36:40.740
You being so silly not very bright and cute at the same time makes me want to

09:36:42.340 --> 09:36:44.660
Run and tackle you under the bed and cuddle you

09:36:45.940 --> 09:36:50.180
I would hug you and roll around under the covers and never let you go. Where's can I explain how much I love you?

09:36:50.180 --> 09:36:52.180
You're my sunshine. Oh, you're my sunshine

09:36:53.380 --> 09:36:55.380
Refling

09:36:55.380 --> 09:36:57.380
You like when I'm dumb

09:36:58.100 --> 09:37:02.180
You like when I show how unbelievably brain dead I am. Yeah, is that what you like?

09:37:05.620 --> 09:37:08.740
Sorry, but you're being hard locked as my oh, she does

09:37:10.660 --> 09:37:12.660
We sure do

09:37:13.460 --> 09:37:16.500
Allegedly, why is it so hard to play fricking connect for?

09:37:18.740 --> 09:37:20.740
I don't know why it's so hard

09:37:23.220 --> 09:37:28.580
Uh she be just woke up and said I woke up a bit ago dizzy but wanting to be ravaged

09:37:28.900 --> 09:37:31.380
Okay, she be she be doing better with her migraine

09:37:31.380 --> 09:37:38.660
You are more of a mother to me than my own parents and I hardly even know you you are welcome

09:37:38.900 --> 09:37:41.220
well, I didn't mean you're welcome like that, but

09:37:42.180 --> 09:37:44.180
um

09:37:44.180 --> 09:37:46.180
sometimes

09:37:46.500 --> 09:37:55.300
It's a bit sucky, but some people might not necessarily be the best parents and sometimes it's easier to just

09:37:56.660 --> 09:37:58.660
take a deep breath

09:37:58.660 --> 09:38:00.660
and sigh and say

09:38:01.060 --> 09:38:03.460
They did the best with what they had

09:38:04.340 --> 09:38:06.340
at the time with what they got

09:38:07.060 --> 09:38:08.420
and

09:38:08.420 --> 09:38:13.860
Sometimes it's not easy to swallow the truth and be like, oh that really wasn't as

09:38:14.580 --> 09:38:16.420
nice because

09:38:16.420 --> 09:38:22.740
You know when you watch media, it's like oh the loving parents. They're so supportive. They're so this or so that

09:38:23.700 --> 09:38:30.500
Sometimes it's a hard pill to swallow to say that you drew an unlucky hand

09:38:31.060 --> 09:38:37.540
And that might not necessarily mean you don't still share a love for your primary caregivers

09:38:38.180 --> 09:38:39.140
um

09:38:39.140 --> 09:38:46.740
But there are some phrases in the english language that's like the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb

09:38:47.700 --> 09:38:52.020
Which basically just means the connections that you seek out in life

09:38:52.740 --> 09:38:54.740
that are

09:38:54.820 --> 09:38:56.820
outside of your family

09:38:57.620 --> 09:39:00.980
Can be just as valid if not more loving

09:39:01.540 --> 09:39:06.660
than family because you don't pick family you don't you don't pick these aspects and

09:39:07.700 --> 09:39:09.700
sometimes it's just easier to

09:39:11.140 --> 09:39:16.340
It's not easy to swallow the pill, but sometimes it's easier to just take a deep breath

09:39:17.220 --> 09:39:19.780
Let out a big sigh and be like okay

09:39:20.660 --> 09:39:22.660
That's just how it is and

09:39:23.620 --> 09:39:25.620
I hope you're doing okay. Yeah

09:39:25.780 --> 09:39:27.140
is

09:39:27.140 --> 09:39:29.140
It sucks, but i'm i'm glad um

09:39:30.340 --> 09:39:33.380
You can feel a degree of motherly love. Um

09:39:34.580 --> 09:39:37.140
You know, I don't think anyone should be embarrassed or

09:39:38.180 --> 09:39:43.140
Uh, what's the word kind of like it's only human nature to crave

09:39:43.620 --> 09:39:44.580
um

09:39:44.580 --> 09:39:49.380
to crave attention to crave love to create to crave

09:39:49.940 --> 09:39:51.940
These positive reinforcers

09:39:52.900 --> 09:39:57.700
That show that you're a part of a community that you're welcome that you're wanted

09:39:57.860 --> 09:40:00.980
So don't ever you know, don't feel embarrassed about that

09:40:01.460 --> 09:40:05.780
Just you know, if you're needing kind of a way to to put it away

09:40:06.260 --> 09:40:10.180
Uh deep down inside you just want like one big sigh and say

09:40:10.980 --> 09:40:17.220
Yeah, you know what that's fucked that situation's fucked, but i'm here. I'm doing it. I'm crushing life

09:40:17.460 --> 09:40:19.460
You know, i've gotten through

09:40:19.460 --> 09:40:25.380
The worst days of my life every every worst day of every experience yet. You're still here and you're still

09:40:26.020 --> 09:40:32.500
Trucking along a little reefland and you're doing body. You're doing a body good job. You are so don't don't worry about it. All right

09:40:33.380 --> 09:40:35.380
Don't worry about it. You're doing great

09:40:38.980 --> 09:40:40.980
Fantastic

09:40:41.460 --> 09:40:43.460
Um

09:40:43.860 --> 09:40:50.020
Will you for lack of better words recycle scripts with slight adjustments for the other girls?

09:40:50.660 --> 09:40:56.980
I no longer am the script master, but the answer is no they're all being like created from scratch

09:40:57.700 --> 09:40:58.340
um

09:40:58.340 --> 09:40:59.620
Now they

09:40:59.620 --> 09:41:05.300
Now it can it might like some of the sentences might be the same, but there's only so many ways you can say give me that

09:41:06.420 --> 09:41:08.420
Yeah, um

09:41:08.980 --> 09:41:14.260
Um, give me that schwanz. Um, there's only so many ways you can see it, so

09:41:15.380 --> 09:41:18.820
Uh, there might be some repeated sentences, but yeah

09:41:20.180 --> 09:41:22.180
Thank you strong

09:41:24.100 --> 09:41:25.700

09:43:01.380 --> 09:43:02.500
um

09:43:02.580 --> 09:43:05.780
77 you're now at my level and I played for like eight years

09:43:08.580 --> 09:43:12.260
What there's that saying it was like took four years to do this

09:43:13.060 --> 09:43:15.060
VTuber does it in one week

09:43:15.620 --> 09:43:20.980
Took four took this man four years VTuber comes in and does it in a week. I say that as if

09:43:21.620 --> 09:43:24.740
Reflings didn't like hand me all of the fish and everything

09:43:26.020 --> 09:43:28.020
laughs in agony

09:43:28.180 --> 09:43:30.180
Got that pop-up answer my question

09:43:31.140 --> 09:43:36.820
Guess that pop-up answer my question you can now cook blood runes or can make haggis

09:43:39.780 --> 09:43:44.340
Get this woman on rune crafting absolutely not we are not touching rune crafting when a 10 foot pole

09:43:48.340 --> 09:43:50.340
Wow, let's see. Where were they?

09:43:50.660 --> 09:43:54.980
Yes, please don't ever worry about not being able to donate give money all that jazz

09:43:55.460 --> 09:44:00.020
Free content always coming rough life is freaking hard, especially

09:44:00.900 --> 09:44:02.900
economically in these times

09:44:03.220 --> 09:44:04.900
and

09:44:04.900 --> 09:44:10.340
Where greed is just everywhere hold on that tin foil hat's coming back hold on no go away tin foil hat

09:44:11.700 --> 09:44:15.300
Just in times like this it is much more valuable

09:44:16.420 --> 09:44:17.540
and

09:44:17.540 --> 09:44:19.540
much more

09:44:20.260 --> 09:44:25.460
Much more valuable much more important that you look after yourself

09:44:26.260 --> 09:44:33.060
That you look after whatever situation you're in if you have debts you pay them off if you need a sweet treat

09:44:33.620 --> 09:44:35.860
you indulge in it and if you

09:44:37.220 --> 09:44:40.740
You know after work you need to play video games to de-stress

09:44:41.140 --> 09:44:45.220
Make sure your internet bill is paid and make sure your electricity bill is paid

09:44:45.460 --> 09:44:48.660
So you have access to these abilities to de-stress

09:44:49.140 --> 09:44:54.740
To handle the work day to handle the workflow or to handle any life stresses that you might be going through

09:44:55.220 --> 09:44:59.140
Um, there are just countless situations where people are

09:44:59.780 --> 09:45:03.860
Just going through hell on earth on the inside and on the outside

09:45:03.940 --> 09:45:09.220
They look perfectly fine and you'd have absolutely no clue what on earth is going on with them and you know

09:45:10.100 --> 09:45:11.540
the last thing

09:45:11.540 --> 09:45:13.540
people want to be dealing with is

09:45:14.180 --> 09:45:14.740
um

09:45:14.740 --> 09:45:22.100
Just the stress that builds and builds and builds and builds and builds until you pop people pop people have burnout

09:45:22.180 --> 09:45:25.860
people have breakdowns like you can pop so easily so make sure

09:45:26.660 --> 09:45:30.260
And you know you're looking after yourself first because at the end of the day

09:45:30.340 --> 09:45:32.660
You are the most important person in your life

09:45:33.140 --> 09:45:39.220
And that's the fact for everyone's pov right now. You are the most important person in your life. It's the way it works

09:45:39.380 --> 09:45:46.420
Okay, and you have to look after yourself first. You have to make sure that you're feeling good. You have to you have to enable yourself

09:45:46.980 --> 09:45:48.980
and

09:45:49.060 --> 09:45:54.180
To be on your prime like I'll I'll wipe out mazl's hierarchy and needs right now. Do not think I won't do it

09:45:54.180 --> 09:45:56.900
I will start a psychology lecture or right this second

09:45:57.460 --> 09:46:04.340
I'll put my teacher's glasses on and it is very important to meet your needs first before you ever try and meet the needs of someone else

09:46:04.420 --> 09:46:07.060
however, uh, the exception is that a

09:46:07.460 --> 09:46:13.140
The stupid sentence I've heard is a love yourself first before you love someone else or something like that. Shut the fuck up

09:46:13.140 --> 09:46:16.740
That's the most nonsense statement I've ever heard. Everyone can share the love to any degree

09:46:17.700 --> 09:46:19.700
That's my take on that sense. Um

09:46:21.780 --> 09:46:26.980
You can share love at any point it is simple to share a little bit of love glasses

09:46:27.700 --> 09:46:31.460
toggle no not glasses toggle I never got glasses on my model

09:46:32.100 --> 09:46:34.100
Uh

09:46:34.420 --> 09:46:38.500
This is helping me procrastinate my final. How do you oh no

09:46:39.620 --> 09:46:43.940
That's not good. Damn. I fell asleep for 13 hours and you're still screaming. Yeah

09:46:44.660 --> 09:46:46.660
Do you need iron supplements?

09:46:48.820 --> 09:46:50.820
Sleeping for 13 hours

09:46:51.060 --> 09:46:57.220
Indicates low iron. You might want to get that checked out or just start taking iron supplements. Go for it. Have fun

09:46:58.020 --> 09:47:00.020
You can only take one dose a day anyway

09:47:00.980 --> 09:47:07.220
Cooking was my first 99 in old school runescape. Are you gonna end up making wine? It's expensive, but the fastest

09:47:07.220 --> 09:47:09.860
Yes, we are doing wine. I stopped doing wine

09:47:10.420 --> 09:47:13.620
Reflings gave me a ton of fish. So I'm cooking all the fish first

09:47:14.180 --> 09:47:15.140
Wine

09:47:15.140 --> 09:47:19.300
It requires a lot of focus like I keep missing the fermentation

09:47:19.780 --> 09:47:21.780
period for an xp bomb

09:47:22.100 --> 09:47:24.100
and

09:47:24.420 --> 09:47:26.420
I used to sleep when giving a ton of blood

09:47:27.060 --> 09:47:31.860
And they said I had high iron. Oh, I don't know what high iron would be. How much red meat do you eat?

09:47:32.740 --> 09:47:34.660
I didn't actually sleep

09:47:34.660 --> 09:47:38.740
You just still streamed for such a long time. Oh, okay. I comprehend. I understand

09:47:40.100 --> 09:47:41.700
Comprehendi

09:47:41.700 --> 09:47:43.700
It's just sweet. Comprehendi

09:47:44.580 --> 09:47:46.580
Drink less blood. Are you a vampire?

09:47:48.260 --> 09:47:52.580
If you want the truth anything that might take you away from us

09:47:52.740 --> 09:47:57.380
Makes me want to cry, but I'm not going what can take me away from you

09:47:58.180 --> 09:48:00.180
Motherfucker. I am veiler

09:48:01.460 --> 09:48:05.220
Nothing can stop me other than an internet connection. That's about it

09:48:05.860 --> 09:48:08.260
You know, you don't have to worry about me going anywhere. Nothing

09:48:08.980 --> 09:48:13.300
Nothing can perish me and we already know what we say to death. We say to death not today motherfucker

09:48:13.460 --> 09:48:19.140
I've got refluence. Okay, and they've got me and we've got a lot. We've got a lot of time to make up for okay

09:48:20.260 --> 09:48:21.780
um

09:48:21.780 --> 09:48:27.140
Got another gym post. I don't know what I'd do without you. Don't panic refler. I'm not going anywhere

09:48:27.780 --> 09:48:29.780
Don't panic stop panicking

09:48:33.300 --> 09:48:41.780
The deadly tone fiction do you know how that's how bob marley passed away apparently he rejected penicillin because of his beliefs

09:48:42.260 --> 09:48:47.780
And bob marley that this is love this is love this is love that's that feeling

09:48:48.420 --> 09:48:52.420
That singer passed away because he rejected penicillin

09:48:54.660 --> 09:48:57.140
Why do I keep opening that? I don't even know how I'm doing that

09:48:58.420 --> 09:49:00.020
um

09:49:00.020 --> 09:49:04.580
Yeah, like saws i'm snorting penicillin for free like you don't have to tell me twice if I need it

09:49:05.860 --> 09:49:11.220
Advantage a modern modern tag and doesn't pay it bro. She's gonna reject pen- no i'm not

09:49:11.780 --> 09:49:13.940
Other than my dad's allergic to penicillin

09:49:14.820 --> 09:49:16.820
um

09:49:17.460 --> 09:49:19.460
you

09:49:19.780 --> 09:49:22.260
Mummy I need a countdown. Please let me in

09:49:22.660 --> 09:49:28.500
Uh, I don't know if you're on the patreon, but there's a new patreon audio with that in it

09:49:29.540 --> 09:49:31.940
Unending stamina. Good. I didn't try that

09:49:32.820 --> 09:49:35.140
Uh, yeah, I was freaking I was

09:49:36.100 --> 09:49:38.020
clapping

09:49:38.020 --> 09:49:42.820
I was clapping without my hands asmr and then right at the end of it. I was like, oh

09:49:43.140 --> 09:49:45.540
I was a little cheeky cat there might as well

09:49:46.180 --> 09:49:51.380
I'm allergic to that stuff. Yes penicillin can be incredibly deadly for some people which is crazy

09:49:52.260 --> 09:49:53.300
um

09:49:53.300 --> 09:49:58.340
I'm pretty sure the guy who discovered penicillin did it by a complete accident as well, which was rather interesting

09:49:58.660 --> 09:49:59.620
uh

09:49:59.620 --> 09:50:01.220
There's just complete accident

09:50:01.220 --> 09:50:04.740
casually discover something that saves literally millions of lives cat

09:50:04.820 --> 09:50:10.500
Uh, you know, just get a little casual probably in the billions as time goes on easily a billion lives saved because of

09:50:10.980 --> 09:50:13.940
little accidental petri dish discovery. Um

09:50:15.700 --> 09:50:17.700
It's really fascinating fascinating

09:50:19.060 --> 09:50:24.180
Should maybe go into the lore of biology. Uh, no should go into the lore the start of modern modern

09:50:24.740 --> 09:50:27.540
The wonders of modern medicine. Nah, I'm mercy

09:50:29.460 --> 09:50:30.900
Not yet

09:50:30.900 --> 09:50:36.740
How many things can you take at a time? I don't know refland. Should we meet up at convention and find out?

09:50:40.740 --> 09:50:42.740
I

09:50:44.260 --> 09:50:46.260
Would you make us a hypnosis

09:50:46.340 --> 09:50:48.340
To get as hard just by hearing oh

09:50:49.380 --> 09:50:55.300
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that part out loud. Sorry. Sorry. I'm forgetting to censor. I'm forgetting to censor

09:50:55.460 --> 09:50:57.460
I've been streaming for a hot second now

09:50:59.460 --> 09:51:06.820
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that out loud. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm supposed to censor what I say

09:51:10.820 --> 09:51:12.820
Oh

09:51:14.420 --> 09:51:15.620
Wow

09:51:15.620 --> 09:51:20.660
Okay, let me try again gas my nots might not say so Richard. We're on a list. Um

09:51:21.780 --> 09:51:27.940
What would you make as a hypnosis session to get a the tentacle giving a standing ovation?

09:51:28.900 --> 09:51:31.940
Uh, just by hearing your voice and have the strongest ink

09:51:33.380 --> 09:51:37.940
When we hear you think that's an interesting one. I wouldn't mind giving that a tackle

09:51:37.940 --> 09:51:39.940
Um

09:51:45.940 --> 09:51:53.540
I'll see so the four part series is one of the first attempts I have ever recorded it is not very good

09:51:53.620 --> 09:51:57.300
I'll just say that right now. It's not go away chat. It's my wife now

09:51:58.660 --> 09:52:03.940
Um, I will say that the four free to access audios are my first ever attempt

09:52:04.020 --> 09:52:10.900
I'm not very satisfied with them looking back on them already even though I only produced them like a month and a bit ago. Um

09:52:12.740 --> 09:52:17.460
So do give me patience to kind of learn what works what feedback I get. Um

09:52:19.300 --> 09:52:21.700
I'm very shy, but if you wanted me to

09:52:23.300 --> 09:52:28.740
Mm-hmm in the middle of a crowded city in broad daylight, I would do it. That's how much I care about

09:52:29.060 --> 09:52:33.220
You break the law for me. Do you know it's against the law to do that stuff?

09:52:34.340 --> 09:52:36.340
I wonder when you break the law

09:52:38.740 --> 09:52:40.740
Mm

09:52:41.300 --> 09:52:45.780
Mummy I haven't inked in days because I've been spending all my weekend hours watching veiler boy

09:52:47.220 --> 09:52:50.180
I can't help but support the girls because they make me so happy

09:52:50.820 --> 09:52:52.020
And I don't

09:52:52.020 --> 09:52:56.500
To well livestream it. I'm so pent up. I need mummy. Tell me what to do

09:52:57.220 --> 09:52:59.220
Do you have any of the girls patreon?

09:53:00.180 --> 09:53:03.140
Or if you're a pin pal emmy has a really good funny canton

09:53:06.180 --> 09:53:10.740
Uh, I don't think I have a I don't have a full audio yet. That's accessible

09:53:12.420 --> 09:53:14.420
Wow

09:53:17.620 --> 09:53:19.620
Just ink into the board

09:53:21.460 --> 09:53:24.340
Who goes yeah, oh did that do it for you? Yeah, you like that

09:53:25.140 --> 09:53:28.340
I swallowed it all and then and then did a big old burp at the end

09:53:32.900 --> 09:53:35.940
Day 10 of eating celery. No, we have a set up

09:53:37.540 --> 09:53:39.540
Did I say that? I think I might have read that one already

09:53:40.180 --> 09:53:47.300
Stop eating celery for me. It's terrible. It's it's just like better water in a solid form

09:53:47.300 --> 09:53:49.300
Um

09:53:51.140 --> 09:53:53.140
Parable

09:53:59.540 --> 09:54:02.340
The sucky five bucks asking for a friend

09:54:06.580 --> 09:54:12.740
Stony, I'm really sorry. I tried very hard, but I just couldn't I watched live streams and vods and listened to audios

09:54:12.820 --> 09:54:16.980
None of our daughters do it for me. I keep coming back to you. Hope you understand. You're my community

09:54:16.980 --> 09:54:18.980
I'll stop

09:54:19.780 --> 09:54:25.460
I don't know how you're gonna come in with me. I still support them however I can forever. You're beefling all reefland

09:54:25.860 --> 09:54:28.900
Thank you for you know, thank you for giving them a shot

09:54:30.660 --> 09:54:32.180
I would say

09:54:32.180 --> 09:54:38.900
Sheevy is like incredibly close to me like mentally and personality wise pretty close

09:54:38.980 --> 09:54:44.340
Unless I'm like completely like misreader, but I'd say she's probably the closest

09:54:45.300 --> 09:54:48.900
Uh, personality wise and easiest to consume

09:54:54.180 --> 09:54:58.100
Uh, I would love to share some fanfics, but I don't know if it's appropriate even allowed you can

09:54:58.660 --> 09:55:04.660
But if it is weird, I submit them. Uh, I think you can do pace bin links. I think those are safe

09:55:06.180 --> 09:55:08.180
Hi strongy, hi reefland

09:55:09.140 --> 09:55:15.220
Did you know the term architect and features and comes from the irish actor pierce

09:55:16.020 --> 09:55:20.980
Ro Brossnan who is rumored to have intentionally made his wife

09:55:21.940 --> 09:55:23.140
Gain

09:55:23.140 --> 09:55:27.060
100 pounds over the course of 20 years the term itself is from a quote

09:55:27.700 --> 09:55:29.860
Made on the architects of peace

09:55:30.580 --> 09:55:37.300
Home page a world without wills is too terrible to imagine. He did not write a book and call it that

09:55:38.900 --> 09:55:44.500
Stop is that why he did wait is that from a book he wrote?

09:55:47.140 --> 09:55:49.780
Oh my god, that's a racist

09:55:50.580 --> 09:55:53.060
That's outrageous, but really funny

09:55:56.580 --> 09:55:58.580
Okay

09:55:58.580 --> 09:56:03.060
I like how ac is sweet and emmy is false to the wall and same

09:56:03.780 --> 09:56:07.460
I will continue myself right now. Go to sleep

09:56:09.220 --> 09:56:11.220
Hi strongy your way of

09:56:12.260 --> 09:56:17.460
Gentle talking is one of my favorite triggers. I think if you did scott's wobble bars, it would be amazing

09:56:20.820 --> 09:56:24.340
Is there a way to control my who while on stream on youtube?

09:56:25.300 --> 09:56:29.140
Funny you mentioned that I thought about doing that, but I think it would like to be on banjo

09:56:30.260 --> 09:56:32.260
and

09:56:33.620 --> 09:56:35.620
I

09:56:37.220 --> 09:56:39.220
Have you considered using

09:56:40.420 --> 09:56:45.220
Bitmosis to plant suggestions that are wholly positive and affirming for the viewer

09:56:45.700 --> 09:56:49.860
Something to encourage them when they're down to give them that little push when they're low

09:56:50.500 --> 09:56:56.420
Don't don't want to do the dishes strongy would want you to don't want to cook and just want to order out strongy

09:56:56.420 --> 09:57:02.820
Would want you to cook strongy would want me to live my best life. That's interesting. I'm wondering

09:57:03.620 --> 09:57:07.780
If I could do a put in you to sleep asmr

09:57:08.580 --> 09:57:11.300
but it's secretly hypnosis and then

09:57:12.180 --> 09:57:16.660
After you've fallen asleep, then I would do like that kind of

09:57:17.780 --> 09:57:19.780
in

09:57:19.780 --> 09:57:21.780
In in planting

09:57:22.900 --> 09:57:26.980
You've got me thinking a little bit when you got me thinking the cogs are turning

09:57:28.740 --> 09:57:31.140
You got me at help you go to sleep. Yes, I think

09:57:31.700 --> 09:57:36.740
You could do it if you established triggers outside of youtube and then use some in you

09:57:38.740 --> 09:57:45.220
I see is way more insane. I thought me was uh having fun

09:57:48.500 --> 09:57:55.620
I see just yeah, she doesn't like sharing on g fog sans sense or something that uh has been sent somewhere else. She doesn't like that

09:57:56.180 --> 09:58:01.300
That would be perfect imprinting. Oh my god

09:58:08.180 --> 09:58:10.180
What is deceit too

09:58:14.660 --> 09:58:16.660
I'm about to get pranked when I look off on us

09:58:18.500 --> 09:58:20.500
Bank the banker

09:58:22.980 --> 09:58:24.980
Why do you do that I'm getting

09:58:25.860 --> 09:58:27.860
I

09:58:36.020 --> 09:58:38.020
Is a real game

09:58:45.140 --> 09:58:48.100
The c2 has just released its free to play update

09:58:48.180 --> 09:58:53.860
So I'm making an updated guide for it as there are many new things around the map whether that be players

09:58:54.100 --> 09:58:59.060
Points below about 50 sanity one grab from a terror will kill it

09:58:59.620 --> 09:59:04.180
Is it where wait if I'm getting chased by a werewolf the streaming gonna end good that's on something

09:59:04.660 --> 09:59:06.660
honey soaked

09:59:06.980 --> 09:59:11.140
Is it am I getting chased by a werewolf in that game? That's terrible. All of us are gonna be freaking

09:59:11.860 --> 09:59:16.740
Male on stream me. Oh, sorry. I'm looking at a how to play deceit to full gay 2024

09:59:17.460 --> 09:59:19.460
My apologies. Sorry

09:59:20.180 --> 09:59:26.740
Um, all right, that was loud. Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. My bad. I was just trying to see what the gameplay was about

09:59:28.740 --> 09:59:30.740
There's werewolves

09:59:33.140 --> 09:59:36.100
Bro sounded nice though. I mean we have every physical

09:59:36.980 --> 09:59:42.020
Come come on. I was just loud my apologies. Don't need to jump serious

09:59:43.460 --> 09:59:48.340
We're at 2000 swordfish. Can I do it? Do we have enough time?

09:59:50.420 --> 09:59:53.540
Cutting it close cutting it close. I think it's possible

09:59:56.580 --> 10:00:04.020
Science is a wonderful thing like the scientist Fritz Harba who with Carl Bosch invented the harbour Bosch process to synthesize

10:00:04.260 --> 10:00:11.460
Ammonia since then it has been possible to supply millions of people with food and toxic gas and chemical warfare

10:00:13.300 --> 10:00:16.580
I'm sure the government would never poison its citizens on purpose

10:00:17.540 --> 10:00:22.900
No, that's it. Give me the tin foil hat back on. I'm about to tell you what american have done as people

10:00:24.020 --> 10:00:26.740
Thank you iron reaper for the 20 my goodness

10:00:28.100 --> 10:00:31.620
You sure you give a lot of money. Yeah, you sure everything's okay

10:00:32.740 --> 10:00:34.180
um

10:00:34.180 --> 10:00:39.780
You got figure out who the infected are and either kill them or do the task and escape without dying

10:00:39.860 --> 10:00:43.060
You either try and portray your friends could be cool. I'm addicted to this

10:00:43.860 --> 10:00:45.620
hmm

10:00:45.620 --> 10:00:49.460
Well, if I'm getting chased by a werewolf, whatever happens. I'm gonna just let it happen

10:00:50.260 --> 10:00:52.260
I

10:00:53.860 --> 10:00:58.740
Uh, scrawny you're gonna get all logged out in 52 minutes unless you hot wait actually

10:01:01.940 --> 10:01:04.260
Don't need to like purposely time out

10:01:07.780 --> 10:01:10.340
Why why can't people be addicted to games

10:01:10.580 --> 10:01:16.020
I'm an adult. I consent to being addicted to old-school runescape and playing with reefing

10:01:16.660 --> 10:01:18.660
You can log back out in in as well. Yeah

10:01:19.540 --> 10:01:25.060
I'll probably go for a tinkle break in an hour and make a cup of tea just for my throat

10:01:26.020 --> 10:01:28.020
And unless I do it now

10:01:32.420 --> 10:01:34.820
Carl Bosch not to be confused with Carl Bosch

10:01:35.380 --> 10:01:42.180
You want some madness fuel? Look at the all all the times America has stuck its nose into

10:01:44.180 --> 10:01:50.740
But did you ask her overlords? I know I never asked overlords for permission. Silly me. Silly me. Silly me streamer

10:01:54.180 --> 10:01:55.780
Sure

10:01:55.780 --> 10:01:57.780
Then you can just log back in I better

10:01:58.900 --> 10:02:00.900
I better

10:02:02.100 --> 10:02:04.100
What

10:02:05.300 --> 10:02:07.300
Is

10:02:07.620 --> 10:02:12.580

10:03:30.740 --> 10:03:32.740

You know the one story I really don't like

Is the the guy they kept alive that got covered in radiation

10:03:46.660 --> 10:03:50.980
And they kept him alive and his body couldn't accept painkillers

10:03:52.820 --> 10:03:54.020
Ah

10:03:54.020 --> 10:04:01.460
They couldn't give him morphine and he was alive for like another two weeks just radiating away. Oh trade. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. My bad. Sorry

10:05:08.580 --> 10:05:10.580
Never ask why

10:05:10.660 --> 10:05:17.060
Volkswagen is so popular such a successful business. Whoa. What's this loot chest? How have I not seen this? I've been here for how long?

10:05:17.780 --> 10:05:20.660
You do not currently have any wilderness loot keys

10:05:22.660 --> 10:05:24.660
Well, excuse you

10:05:26.260 --> 10:05:29.300
Maybe some of us don't want wilderness loot keys

10:05:33.620 --> 10:05:35.060

10:06:19.940 --> 10:06:21.940

Uh, I don't think we're gonna get 20 by the time the stream finish. I got two hours

10:06:57.780 --> 10:07:00.980
We're cooking up the swordfish. Honestly the swordfish ain't that bad

10:07:02.020 --> 10:07:07.540
140 isn't that bad per-cooked swordfish. I'm not mad at that. I know wine is a lot faster

10:07:08.180 --> 10:07:14.580
And I understand wine is a lot faster, but this I'm I'm being cheering danger man being cheering

10:07:16.660 --> 10:07:23.140
I have to be up early for lab. Yes, please rest well anyone who needs to sleep or you've got commitments

10:07:30.500 --> 10:07:34.420
To what to go rest or go get stuff done

10:07:34.820 --> 10:07:41.700
I am literally cooking these and then doing wine until it's time to until the vod is ready to explode

10:07:42.420 --> 10:07:43.540
Um

10:07:43.540 --> 10:07:50.180
If mersey is still playing harvester 2 she might be we might get a successful redirect into mersey or

10:07:50.980 --> 10:07:56.100
I don't know if a zero is doing a part two of stray or she's gonna try and just stray in one run. Um

10:07:58.100 --> 10:08:00.100
Uh

10:08:00.340 --> 10:08:04.820
I thought it was less than two. Yeah, no, it oh well is less than two hours now

10:08:05.060 --> 10:08:09.700
Boo youtube vods fix them so I can do 14 hour streams

10:08:10.340 --> 10:08:12.340
Boo youtube

10:08:13.140 --> 10:08:14.980
YouTube

10:08:14.980 --> 10:08:18.820
Remember to sell cooked swordfish when you're done. We'll get a pretty penny

10:08:20.180 --> 10:08:23.060
No night cuddles rest well sleepy heads

10:08:24.180 --> 10:08:26.180
Then it goes to sleep

10:08:26.420 --> 10:08:28.420
To sleep to sleep

10:08:28.820 --> 10:08:32.820
It's time to go to sleep and rest your little head

10:08:36.260 --> 10:08:38.260
Rest well

10:08:41.300 --> 10:08:44.580
24 hour stream no if youtube's

10:08:45.140 --> 10:08:50.340
Vods didn't break on 12 hours. I would definitely push 14 hour streams

10:08:51.460 --> 10:08:53.460
um

10:08:53.540 --> 10:08:55.540
Can you convert them into bank notes?

10:08:56.420 --> 10:09:01.540
It kind of looks like you can only sell in stacks of 20. Yes, you can make bank notes

10:09:02.020 --> 10:09:05.460
Uh in order to make a bank note you go to the bank

10:09:05.780 --> 10:09:12.260
Don't do why you click there you go to the bank and then it says withdraw as and then you've got no

10:09:13.220 --> 10:09:17.060
And then you click on it note all and then I produce a note

10:09:17.220 --> 10:09:19.300
So you have to do it via the bank to do that

10:09:19.540 --> 10:09:23.620
But I withdraw as items because I'm currently wanting to interact with the items that I'm pulling out

10:09:24.420 --> 10:09:27.300
Hey, but that's how you do it and you can sell them all at one time

10:09:29.780 --> 10:09:32.500
And don't worry that you didn't know because you don't know until you know

10:09:37.220 --> 10:09:40.580
Enjoy the rest of the cooking stream. Love you strong. I love you replay

10:09:41.540 --> 10:09:43.540
Rest well sleepy heads

10:10:05.540 --> 10:10:07.540
What did you just give me?

10:10:08.340 --> 10:10:10.820
Did you just give me ink?

10:10:15.540 --> 10:10:17.540
It's not ink

10:10:18.020 --> 10:10:20.020
Oh, it's a wolf clock dumbass

10:10:20.900 --> 10:10:22.900
What on earth that looks like ink?

10:10:24.340 --> 10:10:30.020
Wow, oh my god. I'm like get it out of the wazoo like I'm getting so pimped out right now. I'm not being funny

10:10:59.220 --> 10:11:01.220
Rip all yours. Thank you

10:11:01.460 --> 10:11:05.060
Oh, that's raw swordfish

10:11:09.460 --> 10:11:13.220
Maybe 30 minutes, I'll make a cup of tea because my voice is really starting to

10:11:13.940 --> 10:11:18.180
What do you mean talking for 10 hours straight means my voice gets tired?

10:11:18.500 --> 10:11:21.060
What that I've never that's ridiculous

10:11:22.500 --> 10:11:24.820
That's ridiculous. I've never heard that before

10:11:28.580 --> 10:11:30.580
Hydration

10:11:31.780 --> 10:11:33.780
Mmm

10:11:35.380 --> 10:11:37.380
Wow

10:11:37.700 --> 10:11:41.940
Yes, I think I might make a cup of tea and the heat should hopefully help my vocal cords

10:11:42.980 --> 10:11:47.940
But they're starting to feel it mr. Krabs seriously how frustrating

10:11:51.460 --> 10:11:57.780
I think they say like one of the worst things you can drink is like dairy and fizzy juice when you have like long vocal activity

10:11:58.100 --> 10:12:01.620
I'm like, oh, yes, the two worst things that I consume constantly

10:12:03.140 --> 10:12:06.500
I have fizzy juice every day and I have a honey tea every day

10:12:07.860 --> 10:12:11.780
I finally got my painting desk cleaned off time a pain. Oh my god

10:12:13.540 --> 10:12:17.780
We should do a Bob Ross stream. Oh the wolf caught me down the floor

10:12:20.420 --> 10:12:22.020
Okay, boom

10:12:22.020 --> 10:12:24.020
we're at 1.8 for the

10:12:24.580 --> 10:12:25.940
a

10:12:26.020 --> 10:12:32.500
The fishy I guess once all these fishies are done. We'll sell them and then I'm just gonna buy a ton of wine

10:12:33.300 --> 10:12:38.740
Strongly doesn't like my wolf coat. No, I do like it, but it removes the reef link from my shoulder

10:12:38.740 --> 10:12:41.700
I know it looks nothing like a reef link, but I want to be parrot

10:12:44.820 --> 10:12:47.460
I'm just working on cooking on my airman. Oh

10:12:47.860 --> 10:12:49.860
I'm going

10:12:52.740 --> 10:12:56.980
Yeah, those are the two literally you're not supposed to have any dairy and I have like milk honey tea

10:12:57.860 --> 10:13:01.780
And then we compare paintings by the end. Honestly, I'm down for that

10:13:02.980 --> 10:13:07.860
I saw a tweet where someone had to do vocal warm-ups like a singer. Oh, you're supposed to go like

10:13:09.460 --> 10:13:11.780
I got carried to that because my friends my

10:13:12.900 --> 10:13:14.900
I'm out of stamina. I'm out of juice

10:13:15.460 --> 10:13:17.220
vocally I'm

10:13:17.220 --> 10:13:19.220
Who goes there? I'm out of stamina

10:13:21.060 --> 10:13:23.060
I saw yeah

10:13:24.980 --> 10:13:30.580

Read this out loud or is this gonna have everyone saying what wtf? I think we've just gained a far anon

10:13:53.860 --> 10:13:57.380
Please hold in your fars until it starts to get painful

10:13:57.940 --> 10:14:03.140
And then blast them onto the make close up so we can hear your cheeks clapping beneath the

10:14:03.940 --> 10:14:05.620
the basic

10:14:05.620 --> 10:14:07.620
burst of brass

10:14:07.780 --> 10:14:13.220
Actually, did she be far in a stream that I don't know if someone told me she be my vaginal

10:14:18.820 --> 10:14:21.460
I mean I don't judge but I don't think I need you to do that

10:14:22.500 --> 10:14:24.980
Look, we don't really we don't kink shame around here. Okay

10:14:26.020 --> 10:14:28.020
She be and emi both did wait

10:14:28.820 --> 10:14:30.820
Wait, and I've not clipped it

Stop, please tell me you guys clipped it so I can turn it into a short for some reason

10:14:36.420 --> 10:14:42.100
hiccups burps in fart clips of vtubers get so many views

Astrony milk in the clips literally though, I wonder why

Smell a pin pal

10:16:34.260 --> 10:16:40.180
I can't believe how well that stream once is it. I've not seen it. Is it bad. Can you get put kidney stones from that?

10:16:41.380 --> 10:16:44.020
I went to bed get up and you're still cooking these swordfish

10:16:44.660 --> 10:16:48.420
There was five though. No, there was 10,000 swordfish

10:16:49.460 --> 10:16:53.620
If I make 10,000 swordfish one stream that means I can do 10,000

10:16:54.500 --> 10:16:58.580
Wine in one stream most likely if not more it means bod is

10:16:59.700 --> 10:17:02.340
Back up actually did she cut something out of it?

10:17:02.500 --> 10:17:05.220
I do not know I've been streaming unfortunately

10:17:07.300 --> 10:17:13.780
Uh when I stream all day I have no clue what shenanigans the girls are getting up to in all honesty

10:17:14.580 --> 10:17:16.580
um

10:17:33.140 --> 10:17:35.140
Oh

10:17:37.620 --> 10:17:40.020
Wait that video is still getting recommended to people

10:17:41.380 --> 10:17:47.140
24,000 views 2,000 likes I wonder if because people are liking it

10:17:48.580 --> 10:17:51.220
Strone has the best boing boing

10:17:52.740 --> 10:17:56.020
Azura has biggest boing boing or do you mean rump?

10:17:58.980 --> 10:18:00.980
I have the biggest rump

10:18:02.500 --> 10:18:04.500
Oh

10:18:05.060 --> 10:18:08.580
The perfect all the better to smother you basically

10:18:09.780 --> 10:18:14.180
She's out pealard anything that ever happened the audio after this it takes a day

10:18:14.820 --> 10:18:18.100
Do you think you'll feel accomplished when you get nighting in cooking? I hope so

10:18:18.900 --> 10:18:21.540
I'm in the trenches right now on this swordfish

10:18:24.900 --> 10:18:28.740
She accidentally played the clip on stream she forgot to turn off this the audio

10:18:32.580 --> 10:18:34.580
Oh

10:18:35.140 --> 10:18:39.060
You can pass away if you drink too much water she accidentally uploaded it to me

10:18:42.500 --> 10:18:44.500
Uh, okay, okay, okay

10:18:46.660 --> 10:18:48.820
She already has a warning on her channel

10:18:50.260 --> 10:18:54.100
Amy playing with fire, but then again she is the pyromaniac of

10:18:55.220 --> 10:18:57.860
Vila, so right um right on par

10:18:59.140 --> 10:19:01.860
Can't believe it can't believe I found such a lore friendly girls

10:19:02.420 --> 10:19:04.420
smile

10:19:06.500 --> 10:19:09.700
I have to admit I'm think I'm starting to lag a bit

10:19:10.740 --> 10:19:12.740
It's not looking good for me

10:19:13.220 --> 10:19:15.220
slowly perishing

10:19:15.220 --> 10:19:21.300
I'm like dad make a tea, but I don't think it's gonna wake me up, but I think it's gonna

10:19:24.180 --> 10:19:27.620
Oh, my stomach's making freaking weird eyes noises. Can you hear that?

10:19:33.220 --> 10:19:37.700
What will come first heat death of the universe or full inventory no burn honestly

10:19:37.940 --> 10:19:44.500
I feel like I'm getting so close to it and then I'm getting although the burn percentage is 9.4 it used to be 18.9

10:19:45.620 --> 10:19:51.620
She cut it out from the vod. We're safe question mark. I'm firmly of the opinion. There's such a thing as

10:19:52.980 --> 10:19:54.580
Being too big

10:19:54.580 --> 10:19:59.380
What's 99 after cooking? No, we're just doing cooking

10:19:59.540 --> 10:20:04.020
We might do some questing together because I'm not familiar with a lot of quests

10:20:04.740 --> 10:20:05.860
um

10:20:05.860 --> 10:20:11.860
But that would just be very casual and probably level up combat a little bit before that and

10:20:12.580 --> 10:20:15.060
once we've achieved 99 cooking and

10:20:16.500 --> 10:20:19.140
I am not 99ing anything else. I

10:20:20.340 --> 10:20:24.180
Have severely underestimated how much this is

10:20:25.380 --> 10:20:27.380
and

10:20:29.380 --> 10:20:31.780
A strong aspect fill to the caboose

10:20:32.980 --> 10:20:37.060
If you ever do the cat quest you have to feed it when it's a kitten or it runs away

10:20:38.020 --> 10:20:41.460
That's so specific. I'm probably never gonna retain this information

10:20:44.180 --> 10:20:48.740
I'm going to go for a full 99 account for the first time off your brave

10:20:50.340 --> 10:20:53.780
And the other version of runescape levels go up to 120

10:20:54.900 --> 10:20:57.140
Did they take even longer to achieve?

10:21:00.340 --> 10:21:05.940
Oh, that's crazy. Sorry. Oh, I'm having a wee yawn. Sorry

10:21:11.140 --> 10:21:13.140
Don't mess that update on that video

10:21:14.660 --> 10:21:22.820
Oh my god, I'm in the money list. I'm sorry. I really don't want to flicks on you guys, but we're in the money

10:21:23.300 --> 10:21:25.300
Oh

10:21:33.540 --> 10:21:40.020
Look, uh, whoa fill inventory. No burn get ready to ever said no burn

10:21:43.060 --> 10:21:45.060
Hold on hold on hold on

10:21:45.220 --> 10:21:48.020
So this is what it looked like a minute ago

10:21:48.980 --> 10:21:53.140
So that was the last time I shared it with you 19.8. Okay

10:21:54.100 --> 10:21:58.660
And the money didn't register, but now the money's registered. Are you ready to get flexed on?

10:22:01.540 --> 10:22:03.540
Where is it?

10:22:04.100 --> 10:22:08.820
Are you ready to get flexed on how much money I made on that video? Boom. That's right. Get flexed on

10:22:10.740 --> 10:22:15.860
To say that gen two has been funded is an understatement. That's how much money I've made

10:22:16.580 --> 10:22:18.580
What are you gonna do about them?

10:22:21.700 --> 10:22:23.700
It got limited ads

10:22:23.700 --> 10:22:27.540
So it probably would have been like 20 bucks if it wasn't limited ads

10:22:28.020 --> 10:22:31.860
But you know what 10 bucks I'll take you you'll be logged out in 30 minutes

10:22:31.860 --> 10:22:34.660
Make sure you move to a safe area or log out now

10:22:35.620 --> 10:22:37.220
Your mama

10:22:37.220 --> 10:22:41.620
Right. I I'm gonna go make a cup of tea then if it's gonna log me out so I can come back in

10:22:42.340 --> 10:22:43.540
And

10:22:43.540 --> 10:22:48.660
Getting 120 is getting 99 about eight times. Oh pass on that. No, thanks

10:22:49.220 --> 10:22:54.180
How do people make a living off of youtube? Oh, it's much better than this when you have like a

10:22:55.140 --> 10:23:00.900
A lot of ASMR videos to offer and you make like money generated in the background

10:23:01.140 --> 10:23:05.540
Right, I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and let this game log me out. Um, I will be back

10:23:05.620 --> 10:23:08.180
I would just take me about three minutes because you can't leave the world

10:23:11.940 --> 10:23:14.740
They're in the runescapes. Uh, gay Brooks Johnny

10:23:16.580 --> 10:23:17.940
Uh

10:23:17.940 --> 10:23:19.380
Right, I'll be

10:23:19.380 --> 10:23:26.420
Yeah, three minutes and I'll make a cup of tea. Please do stretch your legs and all that jazz. Um, I will be back

10:23:27.300 --> 10:23:32.020
In three minutes, which I've said for the eighth time now. Sorry. I'm losing it. Well, I'll be back

10:23:41.620 --> 10:23:43.620
So

10:24:11.620 --> 10:24:13.620
So

10:24:41.620 --> 10:24:43.620
So

10:25:11.620 --> 10:25:13.620
So

10:25:41.620 --> 10:25:43.620
So

10:26:11.620 --> 10:26:13.620
So

10:26:41.620 --> 10:26:43.620
So

10:27:11.620 --> 10:27:13.620
So

10:27:41.620 --> 10:27:43.620
So

10:28:11.620 --> 10:28:13.620
So

10:28:41.620 --> 10:28:43.620
So

10:29:11.620 --> 10:29:13.620
So

10:29:31.860 --> 10:29:36.500
Oh, it's actually quite a lot louder than in-game audio. Sorry if that like completely destroyed your ears

10:29:36.900 --> 10:29:38.900
Hope no one's sleeping through this

10:29:39.460 --> 10:29:42.660
Her account is gone too. Wait, who's the count? Look at that

10:29:46.180 --> 10:29:48.180
Um

10:29:48.260 --> 10:29:50.260
What was I doing

10:29:50.260 --> 10:29:52.260
Fish fish fish

10:29:52.500 --> 10:29:57.860
Um, I I'm starting to pass out. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting very tired. I'm a throats very sore

10:29:59.860 --> 10:30:02.180
Which is why I need refilling tea

10:30:03.220 --> 10:30:05.220
Not just any kind of honey tea

10:30:06.180 --> 10:30:13.140
Well, I'll get a timer in five minutes. The music was pretty loud. Okay, my apologies. Oh, I've got honey on my freaking finger as well

10:30:14.740 --> 10:30:17.700
I'm not the good I'm not my refilling honey. I need a special refill

10:30:18.340 --> 10:30:20.660
The menu music apparently a separate set. Yeah

10:30:22.660 --> 10:30:24.660
Monkey badness

10:30:27.060 --> 10:30:30.900
Nice sleepy little reeflings who were already snoozed together honestly

10:30:31.700 --> 10:30:34.900
Oh, I'm I'm getting tired myself

10:30:44.820 --> 10:30:49.940
Oh gee Hermes, thank you for becoming a member as a reminder

10:30:51.220 --> 10:30:53.220
All membership streams

10:30:53.860 --> 10:30:54.900
No

10:30:54.900 --> 10:30:58.660
Next week membership streams start because I've already locked in what happens this week

10:30:59.460 --> 10:31:01.460
Next week is very busy

10:31:02.580 --> 10:31:04.580
as next week when

10:31:06.100 --> 10:31:06.980
Uh

10:31:06.980 --> 10:31:08.740
Elden Ring comes out

10:31:08.740 --> 10:31:12.260
It's today next week Elden Ring DLC comes out. Okay, so

10:31:13.300 --> 10:31:15.380
The start of the week is going to be like a

10:31:16.340 --> 10:31:20.900
multitude of different things going on. It's a little bit crazy sometimes

10:31:21.860 --> 10:31:28.340
Refilling tea you mean ink tea exactly. That's what my refilling tea is

10:31:29.780 --> 10:31:31.780
Passed it four times, but I got the tea

10:31:34.020 --> 10:31:40.580
A bit oh my god, I love those stories where it's like my legs are quaking after a good session. I'm like, oh my god

10:31:41.540 --> 10:31:44.660
Oh, no, that's not it is I can't feel my legs after

10:31:45.460 --> 10:31:49.380
How hard I was beating in that session those ones always make me crack up

10:31:50.900 --> 10:31:52.900
What's good

10:31:55.060 --> 10:31:56.660
Uh

10:31:56.660 --> 10:32:02.740
What's good, uh, we're going 10 and a half hour strong. We're wrapping up an hour

10:32:03.780 --> 10:32:11.140
In less than 30 because of the void restriction. Um, I am going to see if mercy is available

10:32:11.940 --> 10:32:13.940
to read into or a zero

10:32:14.820 --> 10:32:16.820
um

10:32:17.060 --> 10:32:21.700
Oh, my tummy keeps making noises because I need uh, did I end up going for a job?

10:32:22.340 --> 10:32:27.620
No, it wasn't successful. I had an unsuccessful attempt at adobe, which is why my stomach's making

10:32:28.420 --> 10:32:34.340
Uh, bizarre noises right now. Oh my god. I'm starting to get like full cooked sword run swordfish ones, which is amazing

10:32:34.980 --> 10:32:38.260
Do your reeflings want your money back? Am I undet to beeflings?

10:32:38.820 --> 10:32:42.900
Oh, no, is there any runescape reeflings that I'm indebted to?

10:32:43.620 --> 10:32:50.900
But I don't have any money. How will I ever repay you runescape reefling for all the things you've done?

10:32:55.220 --> 10:32:57.620
Get wrecked and connect for apparently

10:33:00.020 --> 10:33:03.060
Left for a bit and you're still going. Oh, I'm a tough cookie

10:33:03.860 --> 10:33:05.860
Hard hard to get me to crack

10:33:06.340 --> 10:33:10.180
When I say, uh, I need to make up for lost time. I wasn't kidding

10:33:11.140 --> 10:33:15.220
I wasn't kidding. Uh, literally next week we've got like four, maybe even five

10:33:17.700 --> 10:33:23.060
Well, please don't be getting sick. I really don't want to get sick. Oh, I'm not gonna make it if I get sick

10:33:23.780 --> 10:33:26.260
I'm not gonna make it. I really don't want to get sick

10:33:30.980 --> 10:33:36.980
Bless you. Thank you. He's on high. I accept ASMR's payment. Oh, yeah

10:33:36.980 --> 10:33:38.980
Yeah

10:33:39.860 --> 10:33:41.860
Per little

10:33:42.500 --> 10:33:44.500
Needing some tingles

10:33:51.060 --> 10:33:54.100
One hour of agility treatment is payment because I can't be bothered

10:33:56.500 --> 10:34:02.660
I need to maybe get the agility shortcut wherever it is on the map. It's like 21 to do the grand exchange shortcut

10:34:07.060 --> 10:34:09.060
We formally request snitches

10:34:10.660 --> 10:34:14.020
Thank you for being my sugar daddy on runescape

10:34:16.100 --> 10:34:20.820
Thank you for making it super easy real me versus strony connect for

10:34:22.900 --> 10:34:24.900
The real

10:34:26.340 --> 10:34:32.100
Strony milkers warm and tasty strony milkies, please be hey stay. Oh my god, that's such a good

10:34:32.820 --> 10:34:38.100
Uh, there's a connect for minigame and runescape. There absolutely is. Do you want to know how I know?

10:34:38.100 --> 10:34:44.420
There's a connect for minigame and runescape. Uh, I got absolutely annihilated by all the reeflings unanimously at once

10:34:45.140 --> 10:34:51.620
Uh, the only reason I think I won I won one game by tryharding and I won a second game by mistake

10:34:52.020 --> 10:34:54.260
Because the other reefling wasn't paying attention

10:34:56.580 --> 10:35:01.380
And I was literally eating a burrito and I was like what the fuck with my mouth full of a burrito

10:35:02.100 --> 10:35:04.100
I

10:35:05.700 --> 10:35:09.060
If you're going to do agility, there's a quest so you can skip a lot of it

10:35:09.860 --> 10:35:11.860
I think when we do 99

10:35:12.420 --> 10:35:19.140
Cookin will probably take a solid break from any runescape streams for a bit because there are a few other like multiplayer games

10:35:19.140 --> 10:35:22.340
I want to like focus on like elden rings like the next big

10:35:23.140 --> 10:35:25.140
Like a thing we're taking on

10:35:25.700 --> 10:35:27.700
and

10:35:28.260 --> 10:35:30.260
I don't know if you can hear my stomach

10:35:32.260 --> 10:35:35.300
No, you can't the mic's not covered. It's covering it up

10:35:36.660 --> 10:35:42.100
Just Johnny's milk tastes like jelly. I even know what cuttlefish milk would taste like

10:35:44.100 --> 10:35:47.380
Would it be gelatinous or would it be silky like ink?

10:35:49.460 --> 10:35:51.460
I think it may be silky

10:35:53.300 --> 10:35:55.300
Worthing

10:35:55.300 --> 10:35:57.220
Love these 20 things

10:35:57.220 --> 10:35:59.220
Thank you for the smoothies

10:35:59.220 --> 10:36:01.220
Also need to be on a members world for uh

10:36:02.340 --> 10:36:07.780
I'm blamed when it comes to board games. I lost fair and square though. Okay. Okay. Okay

10:36:09.860 --> 10:36:15.620
Well, actually who's got the higher IQ reeflings are strong in clearly the reef one clearly

10:36:23.540 --> 10:36:24.580
Wow

10:36:24.580 --> 10:36:28.740
We're at 1.4 on the swordfish. We may be able to finish it

10:36:29.220 --> 10:36:30.340
Or

10:36:30.340 --> 10:36:33.860
We might just be out of time, but honestly, it's not the biggest deal. However

10:36:34.900 --> 10:36:38.260
You need to give strongy the monkey nut items. That's so specific

10:36:39.540 --> 10:36:41.540
and

10:36:41.700 --> 10:36:46.260
And could we solely if it's anything like squid ink you've eaten squid ink before

10:36:48.420 --> 10:36:54.740
You've eaten your fellow reeflings before oh, we're in 1.6 k territory at 1,600

10:36:55.380 --> 10:36:59.540
Monkey nuts 287. I blame all my eyes. I

10:37:03.220 --> 10:37:06.020
I'm on you you eating your fellow reeflings. What's going on here?

10:37:06.020 --> 10:37:08.020
Oh

10:37:22.340 --> 10:37:23.620
See to be honest

10:37:23.620 --> 10:37:26.740
You were just randomly placing the pieces, but I wasn't low

10:37:26.900 --> 10:37:31.380
I was trying to counteract what the reefling was doing. That's the worst part

10:37:31.540 --> 10:37:36.340
I was actually trying to win and I could never see what the reefling was making

10:37:36.660 --> 10:37:43.060
I was too busy trying to like get ahead and make something for me that I couldn't see what the reefling was doing

10:37:46.580 --> 10:37:54.500
Is worse than emmy rip of my jeans what I listen to emmy stream and if I recall correctly my glass prescription is worse than emmy

10:37:55.060 --> 10:37:59.700
Oh, emmy cannot see. Oh my goodness bless her cotton socks. She can't see for

10:38:02.340 --> 10:38:05.780
I reeflings gotta do what he got a scuba doo ba doo

10:38:08.020 --> 10:38:13.460
Yeah, you literally saw what I was doing and then you forgot no because I was trying to like

10:38:14.180 --> 10:38:17.780
I was trying to be like all the reeflings doing this the reeflings doing that right

10:38:17.780 --> 10:38:20.660
So I'm not gonna place one here and then I'd immediately forget

10:38:24.020 --> 10:38:26.020
Mods cruises jays

10:38:27.460 --> 10:38:29.460
You really want me to believe that yeah

10:38:30.420 --> 10:38:32.420
I was like trying to think ahead

10:38:40.020 --> 10:38:44.580
I believe I can't believe I made it 10 us dollars. It feels good man

10:38:51.540 --> 10:38:53.540
Wow

10:38:54.100 --> 10:38:56.340
Okay, these swordfish are giving me like

10:38:56.580 --> 10:38:57.860
What

10:38:57.860 --> 10:39:00.820
7k a batch that's not bad

10:39:02.340 --> 10:39:06.260
Honestly not bad. I know wine is more which is fine

10:39:06.900 --> 10:39:12.020
But I think that's like 7k xp of inventory if I don't burn them all. Okay. Okay

10:39:13.620 --> 10:39:15.620
Well spoke too soon on that one

10:39:19.060 --> 10:39:20.900
Congrats on level up

10:39:20.980 --> 10:39:26.900
It's time to beat on up on connect for strategy. It's like I'm beat strong the next time

10:39:34.500 --> 10:39:39.940
What's my burn percentage? Oh, it's like oh, I guess it's not up to accuracy because I logged out

10:39:41.060 --> 10:39:44.260
I got logged out against me will yeah, um

10:39:45.220 --> 10:39:51.700
Right tomorrow's crash bandicoot, which is eight hours. So it's just a long stream in quotation marks

10:39:52.820 --> 10:39:54.820
Not an endurance

10:39:55.060 --> 10:40:00.260
Short stream is two hours. Um, which is buckshot roulette, but that's because I've got the doctor

10:40:03.300 --> 10:40:07.460
And I'll keep you guys up to date on what on earth is happening with me toe

10:40:07.540 --> 10:40:11.540
But it's pretty much decided if you guys want to hold a funeral during buckshot roulette

10:40:12.020 --> 10:40:14.980
You're more than welcome to pour one out for the toe

10:40:16.100 --> 10:40:18.100
It's been a good run, but

10:40:18.420 --> 10:40:21.380
I'm just no fussed for it. Does they make a difference to me?

10:40:22.420 --> 10:40:24.420
To me

10:40:24.980 --> 10:40:26.980
To me

10:40:28.820 --> 10:40:30.580
Riptoe

10:40:30.580 --> 10:40:37.140
It's a great lineup. Yeah, I do. Um, I want or probably can't do it tonight because I'm going to be shattered

10:40:37.540 --> 10:40:42.660
I need to go put emmy and aces memberships live literally as soon as I end this stream

10:40:44.100 --> 10:40:46.100
So I need to

10:40:46.500 --> 10:40:48.500
What I need to do

10:40:50.260 --> 10:40:52.260
I need to

10:40:53.380 --> 10:40:55.380
Do that

10:40:55.860 --> 10:41:00.580
I wanted to look up baltro more because that actually looks like a genuinely fun game

10:41:01.140 --> 10:41:04.020
I just need to comprehend what on earth i'm doing first

10:41:04.580 --> 10:41:09.940
I don't know. Maybe I need to play it offline like off stream for a little bit just to get the hang of it

10:41:11.220 --> 10:41:14.340
Or is it better if streamer plays it for the first time?

10:41:15.380 --> 10:41:18.100
Like I don't think watching other people play it is cheating

10:41:19.700 --> 10:41:23.940
Rip the big gripper you will be missed literally both of them. No, no, just the one

10:41:25.460 --> 10:41:27.780
Shawnee caught the da budus. Oh, no

10:41:28.420 --> 10:41:30.420
People don't think I've got da budus

10:41:31.380 --> 10:41:38.580
Um, oh my god a streamer tries american sweet loses toenails loses toenail within

10:41:39.460 --> 10:41:41.220
one week

10:41:41.220 --> 10:41:43.220
Diabetes hits hard on streamer

10:41:47.060 --> 10:41:51.060
How many features do you see how many where we get no burns one?

10:41:52.580 --> 10:41:54.580
Honestly

10:41:54.820 --> 10:41:59.620
How many multiplayer games are on your to-do list multiplayer games are every week

10:42:00.820 --> 10:42:05.380
um next multiplayer game is elden ring for a while and then

10:42:07.140 --> 10:42:09.140
Probably jellybean

10:42:10.580 --> 10:42:17.460
I love my jellybean. I don't know if they've added more stuff to it. Um, we never gave dead by daylight ago

10:42:17.540 --> 10:42:19.540
I don't know how that would work

10:42:20.340 --> 10:42:26.260
I think I would have to add you guys as friends possibly on steam and then delete everyone at the end

10:42:26.580 --> 10:42:32.500
I don't know. I wanted to give fortnite a shot, but folk were rolling their eyes at fortnite

10:42:32.500 --> 10:42:34.980
But i'm like fortnite's actually know that bad

10:42:35.780 --> 10:42:39.940
As far as i'm aware they've like added in different game modes and stuff

10:42:41.060 --> 10:42:43.060
um

10:42:45.220 --> 10:42:49.620
I want uh, I would say mario kart but I suck at mario kart and it and

10:42:50.740 --> 10:42:54.180
Like I don't I don't know how to do that new turn feature thing in it

10:42:54.260 --> 10:42:56.340
Like we have to like turn left and right well

10:42:58.500 --> 10:43:01.000
Called it momay win the jellybean game

10:43:04.180 --> 10:43:06.920
It's a meme to hate fortnite at this point

10:43:18.100 --> 10:43:19.780
It's just

10:43:19.780 --> 10:43:22.340
Ever listened to rap city you want to sing it

10:43:23.300 --> 10:43:25.780
Is this the real life?

10:43:27.140 --> 10:43:29.700
Or is this just fantasy?

10:43:31.540 --> 10:43:33.540
Caught in a landslide

10:43:35.380 --> 10:43:38.580
No escape from reality

10:43:41.460 --> 10:43:45.300
Look in your eyes, I don't know the words and see

10:43:48.100 --> 10:43:50.100
uh

10:43:50.100 --> 10:44:02.100
So you think you can stop me and make me cry

10:44:04.580 --> 10:44:08.420
So you think i'm just gonna lay down and die

10:44:10.740 --> 10:44:12.740
Oh baby

10:44:14.100 --> 10:44:18.420
Just can't wait to go just can't wait to go here

10:44:19.060 --> 10:44:20.580
Is that the word?

10:44:20.580 --> 10:44:22.580
I don't know. I don't know

10:44:23.940 --> 10:44:25.860
um

10:44:25.860 --> 10:44:27.860
I was thinking about the in-game song oops

10:44:28.580 --> 10:44:30.580
in my bed

10:44:30.900 --> 10:44:32.900
What is, where does that go?

10:44:33.860 --> 10:44:37.060
Easy come easy go little high little woe

10:44:39.060 --> 10:44:42.980
Anyway the wind blows it doesn't matter to me

10:44:43.220 --> 10:44:45.220
Hmm

10:44:45.540 --> 10:44:49.620
I'm just a poor boy from a poor family. He's just a poor boy

10:44:50.660 --> 10:44:53.060
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

10:44:54.900 --> 10:44:56.900
Uh, how else does it go?

10:45:02.500 --> 10:45:04.500
No, no, no, no, let him go

10:45:07.700 --> 10:45:10.420
I can't remember how that freaking goes

10:45:13.780 --> 10:45:15.780
Watch and lock it so you can listen to it

10:45:16.500 --> 10:45:23.540
No, I finished these freaking swordfish before I fall asleep. I'm like so tired my eyes are bulging out of their skull right now

10:45:25.300 --> 10:45:29.940
I'm ready to snooze although I might level up actually before I snooze

10:45:30.580 --> 10:45:34.820
Best cover let me go. We will not let you go. No, no, no, no, no

10:45:35.780 --> 10:45:37.780
No, it's important

10:45:38.500 --> 10:45:45.140
Best cover. Oh, yeah, did you enjoy that me guess and all the lyrics was that entire thing because I completely forgot how it works

10:45:46.420 --> 10:45:48.420
That's the whole level

10:45:48.900 --> 10:45:52.340
Wow, we're gonna be 78 by the end of this feels good, man

10:45:53.460 --> 10:45:55.460
Feel good, man

10:46:00.580 --> 10:46:04.900
Oh, excuse me for yawning. I'm so going to bed. Oh my god

10:46:07.780 --> 10:46:09.780
I

10:46:16.900 --> 10:46:19.940
I'm just a perv. We fun. I need no sympathy

10:46:25.300 --> 10:46:27.300
That wasn't I'm just a fool

10:46:29.060 --> 10:46:31.060
Because I have a mummy I'm

10:46:31.140 --> 10:46:34.740
Mummies losing the plot. That's what mummy's doing right now. I'm starting to

10:46:35.460 --> 10:46:39.140
Uh, yeah, but h2o delirious often here

10:46:40.580 --> 10:46:45.460
The bird outside my window the magpies are probably wondering why I have upset them today

10:46:46.580 --> 10:46:48.580
and

10:46:49.860 --> 10:46:51.860
I can do it. I promise

10:46:52.740 --> 10:46:57.060
I can do it. I can stay up reefing. I'm totally not exhausted, but it's okay

10:47:00.740 --> 10:47:02.740
I can make it happen

10:47:02.820 --> 10:47:04.820
I can make it happen

10:47:10.100 --> 10:47:12.100
Yay

10:47:12.180 --> 10:47:17.060
I didn't get any serotonin, but I think it's because I'm so tired. There's no serotonin left in my system

10:47:17.540 --> 10:47:19.860
You don't have anything to burn on the fire. I do so

10:47:20.580 --> 10:47:22.580
level 78

10:47:22.580 --> 10:47:24.580
let's go

10:47:24.900 --> 10:47:26.900
level 78

10:47:26.900 --> 10:47:28.900
Well, now I gotta adapt the learn

10:47:29.700 --> 10:47:34.820
Yeah, eventually serotonin only comes from night in it man. This game was rigged from the start

10:47:36.020 --> 10:47:38.020
Reach for the stars

10:47:40.020 --> 10:47:45.220
Yippee 78. Well, I definitely blew over my guesstimate for what we would be on

10:47:46.420 --> 10:47:50.100
But uh, I'm still back at level 62

10:47:51.540 --> 10:47:57.140
That's fine. Maybe wane cost a lot of money though. That's the only problem

10:47:59.780 --> 10:48:01.780
Oh

10:48:03.300 --> 10:48:07.780
Are we friends? I can do it. I can do it. You kid

10:48:09.540 --> 10:48:12.900
I could also cook and not waste xp. She's passing out. Oh, yeah

10:48:14.580 --> 10:48:18.740
Oh my god, I'm actually like this this sleep is really starting to hit me

10:48:19.380 --> 10:48:22.180
I don't even have my tea yet. Can you hear it? Can you tell them?

10:48:23.140 --> 10:48:28.900
Wow kfp with another 10. Thank you. My goodness

10:48:30.580 --> 10:48:34.420
Are you squidding me right now? Are you squidding me man?

10:48:36.180 --> 10:48:39.220
Congrats to those who caught the membership with their face

10:48:39.700 --> 10:48:42.420
Oh, I wasn't even I wasn't even cooking them

10:48:43.300 --> 10:48:46.740
swordfish. I'm getting so disheartened. I have my copper tea in my hand right now

10:48:47.860 --> 10:48:50.500
I should probably go to sleep. I'm freaking ready to go

10:48:52.180 --> 10:48:54.180
I'm tired

10:48:54.180 --> 10:48:56.500
Strani sounds like she only has one hp left. No

10:48:58.180 --> 10:49:02.020
Wait, I'll just I'll read some really naughty marshmallows. That should wake me up

10:49:03.300 --> 10:49:05.300
Come on ovulation

10:49:05.540 --> 10:49:08.740
Keep me awake so we can oh actually

Mercy is still streaming for another hour

10:49:17.060 --> 10:49:21.620
Just say like strani wants to read into you, but she doesn't know if you're playing for another hour or not

10:49:22.980 --> 10:49:24.980
Um

10:49:25.380 --> 10:49:29.940
If there's any wee snippets that want to be a deer and pass on a message from mummy

10:49:34.580 --> 10:49:36.580
A big bug

10:49:37.540 --> 10:49:43.940
Zero gates zero grapes in vorkuto. Oh wait. Sorry. That's the the bolt from bluffops

10:49:44.740 --> 10:49:46.740
Didn't make it sad

10:49:46.900 --> 10:49:51.860
What's your take on leveling up without only to your little oh, no you can level up all you want

10:49:51.940 --> 10:49:56.820
It's perfectly fine too. I'm not gonna let for me personally. I'm not gonna level up offline

10:49:57.060 --> 10:50:03.220

I'm very tired

10:50:08.180 --> 10:50:10.180
I will drink my tea now

10:50:10.500 --> 10:50:12.500
Oh

10:50:23.460 --> 10:50:26.820
The gifted membership was what I was supposed to say in english

10:50:29.460 --> 10:50:33.300
The royal monkey kicking on top of strani

10:50:33.700 --> 10:50:35.700
You

10:50:39.940 --> 10:50:46.340

10:50:54.500 --> 10:50:57.220
Oh, mommy can do it. Mommy's just very tired

10:50:57.940 --> 10:50:59.860
do everything

10:50:59.860 --> 10:51:04.420
I'm ready to pass out. Oh my god. My bed time's normally five o'clock. I've got

10:51:05.220 --> 10:51:08.020
Two more hours until bedtime and I'm perishing

10:51:09.140 --> 10:51:12.740
I don't want to end early though. The whole point is supposed to be like endurance

10:51:13.060 --> 10:51:16.580
But oh my god, this is like whacking me for the sight of my heat

10:51:20.340 --> 10:51:22.740
Normally I don't do

10:51:25.460 --> 10:51:27.800
Oh my god brain, please cooperate

10:51:30.340 --> 10:51:32.340
My brain's not cooperating. Holy crap

10:51:34.660 --> 10:51:36.660
Sleepy momy

10:51:37.540 --> 10:51:39.540
Sleepy beepy momy

10:51:42.740 --> 10:51:47.140
Almost there almost there. We just have to hold on and replay

10:51:48.500 --> 10:51:50.500
Please hold on with me. Oh

10:51:51.380 --> 10:51:53.540
We can do it

10:51:53.540 --> 10:51:58.740
We just have to cook these billion swordfish that we were kindly gifted replay

10:52:00.820 --> 10:52:02.820
Ah

10:52:02.980 --> 10:52:08.340
Strani, what's your feelings about uh, you start sleeping the same way your girlfriend has happened to?

10:52:09.540 --> 10:52:13.300
See on me. No me doing that to you. Absolutely

10:52:15.700 --> 10:52:18.660
I will discuss more of that in the member stream. Maybe

10:52:20.740 --> 10:52:22.740
Hold the lane

10:52:23.060 --> 10:52:25.060
Hold the lane. I'm holding

10:52:25.940 --> 10:52:27.940
Okay, so

Old school runescape is heavy doing insurance game only getting to challenge strani this much

10:52:33.140 --> 10:52:35.540
Literally, I'm like so tired out of nowhere

10:52:36.340 --> 10:52:40.260
I was supposed to eat that food and it was supposed to freaking help me

10:52:41.620 --> 10:52:45.940
Get more energized and I just want to roll up into a ball and pass out

10:52:46.660 --> 10:52:51.460
I'm like sipping honey tea. It's got caffeine in it. It's gonna do absolutely nothing for me

10:52:52.420 --> 10:52:57.380
A sugar crash. Did I eat with that take away have sugar in it?

10:53:01.140 --> 10:53:03.140
You can sleep early

10:53:04.980 --> 10:53:06.980
Someone got a clues girl

10:53:10.260 --> 10:53:12.260

All right, like I'm not that's not really doing much for me

10:53:28.980 --> 10:53:30.980
But me doing it to you

10:53:34.900 --> 10:53:38.900

10:55:21.620 --> 10:55:23.620
I'm sorry for seeing it out loud

10:55:24.260 --> 10:55:26.260

She makes a lot of random base references should have gone to Scotland spend a week

10:55:45.780 --> 10:55:48.980
In your 20s are you an OG son?

10:55:53.700 --> 10:55:57.060
There he makes you an OG son surely surely

10:56:02.420 --> 10:56:04.900
You should stream more when you're both tired and I'll be like

Shiny, I don't know if you know I don't remember that till day they do it. Who does it?

But the game ends up going offline. Oh like the game updates for patches. Yeah, there he hikes that 31

10:56:28.900 --> 10:56:33.060
So in death's door. No, witchy sons are supposed to be very

I don't know we ended up

10:56:39.540 --> 10:56:43.780
It's all in board your tears or what I live for

10:56:45.140 --> 10:56:47.940
Because you should have picked mercy

10:56:51.220 --> 10:56:54.900
Should have picked any kind of girl of your

10:56:55.620 --> 10:57:03.060
Yeah, my tummy. I don't know if you can hear those internal parts, but if you can hear the internal parts, I'm sorry

10:57:03.060 --> 10:57:05.060
I had to be this way

10:57:08.020 --> 10:57:12.900
Didn't I see this stream this morning 10 hours. Yeah. Yeah, you did. I'm a wee bit addicted

10:57:13.380 --> 10:57:15.380
I'm starting to lose the plot though. So

10:57:16.420 --> 10:57:19.140
You're welcome to watch my descent into madness

10:57:19.620 --> 10:57:24.180
My filter is also gone because I've started to see things. I know I'm not supposed to see

10:57:24.740 --> 10:57:27.300
But they're kind of just coming out just like you're angry, you know

10:57:29.540 --> 10:57:33.380
Only so much I can do we're actually gonna get less than a thousand sorties

10:57:34.980 --> 10:57:39.300
Listen, I mean that internal part. No, they are internal parts. Well, at least I'm a digest

10:57:41.700 --> 10:57:43.700
But this must mean I'm disgusting

10:57:43.700 --> 10:57:45.700
I

10:57:46.580 --> 10:57:50.100
To make myself wealthy she's slowly dying from my

10:57:54.660 --> 10:57:56.260
Oh

10:57:56.260 --> 10:58:02.020
I came in at work quite tired and feisty wrote an entire world domination agenda on my calendar

10:58:02.900 --> 10:58:05.940
Are we doing it? Are we taking down the big companies?

10:58:07.540 --> 10:58:10.580
11 hour grinds that interests of thoughts are taking the wheel

10:58:11.300 --> 10:58:13.300
Take the wheel

10:58:16.420 --> 10:58:17.460
Man really?

10:58:17.460 --> 10:58:21.620
Okay. Oh, I had to complete the start for that. Man runescape is really

10:58:22.340 --> 10:58:27.540
Oh gee. Yes old-school runescape runescape 3 which is the new one. I think

10:58:28.580 --> 10:58:32.500
Not really played that at all. I didn't actually understand

10:58:33.700 --> 10:58:35.940
When it came out there was two different games

10:58:36.340 --> 10:58:40.340
And I think I actually ended up playing runescape 3 for a little bit like a dummy

10:58:40.820 --> 10:58:44.020
Because I was like, why is the game so different? Why did they do that?

10:58:44.420 --> 10:58:46.020
and then

10:58:46.020 --> 10:58:51.300
Or was it they made runescape 3 and then everyone was like oh go back and then they're like, okay

10:58:51.540 --> 10:58:53.540
There's no two games

10:58:55.140 --> 10:59:00.020
These are the golden hours. So this is the last batch. Uh, not quite. We've still got

10:59:03.460 --> 10:59:06.900
50 minutes, I could have sworn it said 50 minutes 50 minutes ago, but

10:59:07.860 --> 10:59:13.220
There's three. I thought there was like runescape 3 wasn't the new runescape called runescape 3

10:59:14.420 --> 10:59:16.420
It's really ojisa

10:59:17.540 --> 10:59:19.540
Get it because that's how I say ojii

10:59:21.140 --> 10:59:25.300
Runescape 3 is the original server from that. It's mostly runescape is them

10:59:25.780 --> 10:59:28.980
We've written the old game back. Oh, okay

10:59:30.260 --> 10:59:36.420
Because they didn't world of warcraft do that as well. There's like an old world warcraft. Oh my god

10:59:37.620 --> 10:59:41.220
My tongue is not even following what I'm telling it to do

10:59:42.260 --> 10:59:44.260
Wow

10:59:47.060 --> 10:59:49.700
You said three batches before this is what? No

10:59:52.660 --> 10:59:54.180
Hmm

10:59:54.180 --> 10:59:58.500
Oh almost just knocked over my cola everywhere. Gee willivers. I really should clean this

10:59:59.460 --> 11:00:04.980
Oh, what happens if I feel not stop opening up the collection and stop eating the swordfish

11:00:05.060 --> 11:00:07.060
We're gonna sell that we need that money

11:00:07.700 --> 11:00:09.700
Okay, right 900 now

11:00:10.740 --> 11:00:12.740
Wow

11:00:14.260 --> 11:00:15.780

four

11:00:28.260 --> 11:00:30.260
for every hundred

11:00:31.620 --> 11:00:33.620
Oh

11:00:34.340 --> 11:00:36.340
Refling on time

11:00:42.500 --> 11:00:50.340
Play both just where what did you see just play both it's not like this game is grinding or anything

11:00:51.140 --> 11:00:56.420
Are you gonna disappoint us or not? I said I'm disappointed. I'm freaking doing it. I'm freaking

11:00:57.380 --> 11:00:59.380

11:01:26.500 --> 11:01:28.500
Holy crap

11:01:28.900 --> 11:01:33.300
As you're refling you're requesting me to go but okay, that looks more like english

11:01:34.420 --> 11:01:36.420
Go to sleep. No you go to sleep

11:01:37.380 --> 11:01:39.380
Go to sleep when

11:01:40.980 --> 11:01:42.980
When something happens

11:01:47.620 --> 11:01:55.140
Go I'm gonna I can do endurance stream. Literally. I don't want to lose my endurance title like two centimeters in of like playing the game

11:01:56.500 --> 11:01:58.340
Wow

11:01:58.900 --> 11:02:00.900
I'll only go to sleep if you come with me

11:02:01.780 --> 11:02:05.940
Come with me. Oh, no, it's wrong one. It's that Japanese song

11:02:06.980 --> 11:02:08.980
Stay with me

11:02:17.140 --> 11:02:19.140
Don't have the rest of my clothes

11:02:22.180 --> 11:02:24.180
I'll only sleep if you just

11:02:24.820 --> 11:02:26.660
Yeah

11:02:26.660 --> 11:02:30.740
Self hypnosis by exhaustion. This is working apparently. No

11:02:33.300 --> 11:02:38.020
You've been streaming for 11 hours nobody's taking your endurance from your title from you

11:02:42.180 --> 11:02:49.140
I'm just gonna eat this little cheeky little bit cheeky swordfish on a Sunday afternoon. I don't even know what day of the week is

11:02:50.020 --> 11:02:52.420
You know what day of the week is stream day

11:02:53.380 --> 11:02:55.380
I like it the beam all my way

11:03:01.140 --> 11:03:03.140
Imagine if I could see me

11:03:06.900 --> 11:03:08.900
Remember that time I got hired to sing

11:03:10.980 --> 11:03:13.620
Right stop it. That's naughty

11:03:14.660 --> 11:03:18.660
That's naughty. Okay. We're almost finished with the swordfish

11:03:22.420 --> 11:03:27.060
You're beginning to feel very very sleepy

11:03:27.700 --> 11:03:31.540
By your talking like a vampire

11:03:36.420 --> 11:03:38.420
Stay with me

11:03:47.540 --> 11:03:50.420
What are they even talking about honestly I feel like I'm eavesdropping

11:03:52.500 --> 11:03:57.780
I wait for their new message to pop up and I'll start commentating on what the reef ones are talking about to each other

11:03:59.060 --> 11:04:01.060
They'll never they'll never expect

11:04:01.620 --> 11:04:04.020
Oh for goodness sake. I don't know how I keep doing that

11:04:06.420 --> 11:04:07.460
Wow

11:04:07.460 --> 11:04:11.300
Boom boom look at that nine third cheek. No

11:04:14.660 --> 11:04:18.100
She collected again. Well, I'm not allowed to collect

11:04:18.820 --> 11:04:25.780
It's because I'm a whammin my mistakes is I'm even in runescape. I'm sorry. That's not nice

11:04:25.860 --> 11:04:30.500
You know, you just play the whammin card whenever you want. That's kind of funny though

11:04:39.220 --> 11:04:43.460
I don't know why you're right-clicking it. I don't know. Maybe maybe I'll right-click you ring

11:04:44.260 --> 11:04:46.260
Right click is funny

11:04:48.820 --> 11:04:50.820
You collect here

11:04:52.660 --> 11:04:54.660
Look into the mirror, you know

11:04:56.020 --> 11:04:58.020
We're talking about time-spanning games

11:04:58.980 --> 11:05:02.980
Is your rune crafting world still up? I remember the little rune crafting

11:05:03.620 --> 11:05:05.620
I don't know what that means

11:05:05.620 --> 11:05:08.820
But thank you for your question. The answer is probably no. Smile

11:05:10.340 --> 11:05:12.340
I don't know anything about runescape

11:05:12.980 --> 11:05:15.860
Good night throny and everyone. I'm gonna see

11:05:16.820 --> 11:05:18.820

I swear if anyone puts anything under 18 to that question your album

11:05:46.580 --> 11:05:49.540
I'm gonna do it

11:05:50.980 --> 11:05:57.300
Okay, we've got 45 minutes or something like that. Oh no, now we've got 50. No, we've got less than 50 minutes

11:05:58.100 --> 11:06:01.060
We've got 49 minutes because the board breaks all of them

11:06:01.460 --> 11:06:03.460
Wow

11:06:12.980 --> 11:06:16.020
Should I write the girl's mirrors as a prank?

11:06:17.380 --> 11:06:19.380
We could do that

11:06:19.700 --> 11:06:22.740
You pretend to not be me and write the girl's mirrors

11:06:24.100 --> 11:06:26.100
And say the most terrible stuff

11:06:31.220 --> 11:06:38.580
Do it do extremely spicy one. Okay, who should we do for?

11:06:40.020 --> 11:06:45.700
Mods, can I give you permission to speak so you give me the girl's links and I'll write some stuff and I'll wash my lips I shouldn't

11:06:45.860 --> 11:06:47.860

So I only mentioned things that only you would know the girls aren't gonna know who we're doing is zero. Oh my god. Okay

You are the goddess who gives blessing

11:07:40.020 --> 11:07:42.420
But I am already blessed

11:07:43.380 --> 11:07:48.420
You didn't have to give them you didn't have to give me the blessing

11:07:49.300 --> 11:07:52.020
God, I love your chocolate milkers

11:07:53.380 --> 11:07:55.380
