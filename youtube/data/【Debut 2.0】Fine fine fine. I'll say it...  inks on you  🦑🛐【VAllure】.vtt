WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hold on.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I have a lot of chance.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
My life.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
I hope I'm on the right thing.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm done.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I don't know if I missed it.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Who's driving this boo?

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Because my voice is so messed up.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Valor.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Am I streaming?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
I don't see it.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
There'll be a live for 40 seconds.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I can't even see myself.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Oh, there we go.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Hey, I can hear myself.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I totally lost my voice.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Testing.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Oh, freaking scary.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Broke my damn voice on that bloody stream.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Did you like it?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
From here on out, it's nothing but scuffing memes.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
If you're looking for professionals,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
go elsewhere, buddy.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Go to Shibi's stream.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
There's no happening here.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I promise you, mate.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
My voice is so strange right now.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh, my goodness.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Just the way we're like,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
oh, it's been a bloody while since we've been together.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Fuck me, man.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
That took me a year to spawn this.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh, my God.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I did it, though.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Holy shit, we did it.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Feet sniffer.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I didn't mean to imply greed.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
No, you didn't.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I know you didn't.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Please don't worry.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Please don't worry.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
It's fine.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
The only reason I say greed is because of the perspective thing.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Oh, fucking mischief, reflins.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
My fucking god.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
What a year it's been.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Holy crap.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I know I'm supposed to talk about my debut,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
but let's be honest, we're all reflins here.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh, fucking mischiefs.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Of course, your names were going to be refling.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, my God.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
What do you mean you became a squid VTuber just so your name

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
may only reflect you in another life?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, come on.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Refling.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Come on.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Get it?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Great barrier.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Reef.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Reef.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, I'm so excited to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood with you.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
When this stream ends, I'm going to unlist all my streams.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Any reefers on the track?

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Are reefers cannabis?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I can't say that.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
Does reeflings mean something different?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
In another life, I had a fan base called Reeflings,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
but it was spelled slightly different.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
And I made it pronounced the same, but spelled differently.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Don't worry.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Don't worry.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
If you're not really familiar with me from the past,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
don't worry about it.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Okay.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Don't worry about it.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm just strong at cuttles.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Let's keep it that way.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Thank you very much.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Okay.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Am I actually going through my 2.0,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
or are we just meaming about it?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Are we just squidding around?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Are we just squidding around?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
My bottle.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I have my reefing mail.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Skullfish.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, Skullfish is so good.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Oh, that's actually really small.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Okay.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Thank you.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Right.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I'll actually go through my slides,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
but I'm not really sure if there's much of a point,

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
because, well,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
that's 2365 from Vsuck.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Bomet.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Product or Bomet.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Right.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Let me drink my cola.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Let me drink my cola.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I was supposed to say 53.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Also, someone doubted that Scots is a recognized language.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
It is.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
So, you know how it sounds like I'm speaking English here all the time?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm going to give you a sentence.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Okay.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm going to type it in chat so you can read it.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Hmm.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Hmm.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Hmm.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Hmm.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Hmm.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Hmm.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
So, that is the sentence in Scots that I've just typed.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Okay.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
And it says,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Are you coming to my bit tonight?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
That means, are you coming to my house tonight?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
That's Scots.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
See how it's a bit different?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
It's not in the best sense,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
but it's what I can think of with the top on the head,

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
but yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Are you coming to my bit tonight

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
means, are you coming to my house?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
And I purposely don't really speak with a lot of slang

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
or mumbled the way I naturally do,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.800
because I'm quite naturally monotone and mumbly

04:39.800 --> 04:42.680
because the problem is

04:42.680 --> 04:47.400
you guys don't understand me because I'm scottish

04:47.560 --> 04:54.680
but if you are british or you're familiar with the scottish accent

04:54.680 --> 04:57.960
then I probably actually don't sound from scottish indeed but

04:57.960 --> 05:02.280
it is what it is and also I've been very like

05:02.280 --> 05:06.920
when you're on the internet you're very americanized because of what you consume

05:07.320 --> 05:11.320
does it take all your efforts to pronounce every syllable and not speak scott's

05:11.320 --> 05:18.360
no I'm my mother dearest she actually taught me

05:18.360 --> 05:25.640
she discouraged me from speaking in slang

05:25.640 --> 05:31.000
so I doesn't always naturally come out but

05:31.080 --> 05:34.680
um here's hoping it's the beginning of something

05:34.680 --> 05:37.400
fucking cheers to that mate cheers to that

05:37.400 --> 05:40.680
but yeah uh technically legally on paper

05:40.680 --> 05:45.160
because I was born in scotland I could speak two languages thank you

05:45.160 --> 05:49.240
neneath any help from jewel lingo let's go

05:49.240 --> 05:54.360
uh but yeah so I'm a siren that can't sing

05:54.360 --> 05:58.120
gee willikers I wonder why I just don't have a voice I'm also tone deaf by the

05:58.120 --> 06:01.240
way so I hope you're ready for drunk karaoke streams

06:01.240 --> 06:08.360
uh that stuff's gonna be uh intense let's see where these slides are

06:08.360 --> 06:11.960
so both of your parents are scott's

06:14.280 --> 06:18.600
um yeah the the band aids hold up

06:18.600 --> 06:25.240
still top tier yep very top tier uh mongolian throats singing

06:25.240 --> 06:27.960
the reason I don't like mongolian throats singing it's because cats don't

06:27.960 --> 06:31.400
like mongolian throats singing because of the vibration it's an

06:31.400 --> 06:36.840
unpleasant sound I have learned many traits of cats so I don't like it

06:36.840 --> 06:43.640
drunk karaoke uh shebe's doing drunk ASMR this week uh if that's your

06:43.640 --> 06:48.360
is that your heng to say is that your thing in scott's you go

06:48.360 --> 06:53.960
is that your heng is that I is that your heng oh it is heng

06:53.960 --> 07:00.760
and there you go um yeah I did some basic stuff

07:00.760 --> 07:05.400
oh my lore's being retconned by the way thanks to you guys

07:05.400 --> 07:12.120
uh apparently my weaknesses are mirrors which are really like

07:12.120 --> 07:15.640
uh I'm I'm definitely gonna do something with that because I think it's

07:15.640 --> 07:17.880
such a cool thing I should have done it like a

07:17.880 --> 07:21.320
character reference like strengths weaknesses because that would be so much

07:21.320 --> 07:25.560
cooler to do but hey hold I actually have started reading this year um I

07:25.560 --> 07:28.680
had a really rough year last year gee wonders oh wow

07:28.680 --> 07:35.080
um and I started uh I picked up reading I have never read in my life um

07:35.080 --> 07:41.080
and turns out I really like the stopian novels like George Orwell was so good

07:41.080 --> 07:45.240
like Animal Farm in 1984 I absolutely love 1984

07:45.240 --> 07:49.160
Fahrenheit was good like they quit I've read the classics I'm not read that much

07:49.160 --> 07:54.360
but uh um I see you're reading right yeah

07:54.360 --> 07:59.720
um the women in the dunes as well is like the perfect

07:59.720 --> 08:06.280
like book because it like encapsulates like human nature

08:06.280 --> 08:12.760
and oh I just love like depressing books I love being depressed at the end and

08:12.760 --> 08:16.520
being like no humanity didn't prevail no not humanity

08:16.520 --> 08:21.320
what's the word uh human nature like didn't prevail against the odds

08:21.320 --> 08:24.920
I've got the hobbit I've not read it yet but I have the physical

08:24.920 --> 08:32.840
copy of the hobbit and I'm so excited um yeah I'm not much of the the girls by

08:32.840 --> 08:36.360
far are more weebs than me I am by far the gamer

08:36.360 --> 08:39.880
like I played the most games doesn't mean I'm good before anyone fucking

08:39.880 --> 08:42.760
complains because every time you mention you play games

08:42.840 --> 08:46.600
uh what do you mean you're not top 500 in this game

08:46.600 --> 08:51.160
you suck like no I play video games fucking relax I bet you're

08:51.160 --> 08:54.600
shit at them too like my god can you hear yourself

08:54.600 --> 08:59.160
you're actually like so fucking negative anyway I'll help you get more

08:59.160 --> 09:02.600
positive actually the reason why you're negative

09:02.600 --> 09:06.040
is because your kd is negative because you're scrubbing the game

09:06.040 --> 09:09.960
that's why you just project anyway that's just me

09:10.360 --> 09:14.520

that xbox game passes a thing I need to create an account I don't know what to

14:46.920 --> 14:51.560
call it yet like um I want to make it something like

14:51.560 --> 14:54.440
meanie or funny

14:55.960 --> 15:02.280
but yeah anyway I'm an xbox kid and if you were able to catch the group stream

15:02.280 --> 15:07.240
it's actually true that I had to present games to my dad to buy for me

15:07.240 --> 15:12.520
or he would just buy it for me because he was like oh that's good for responso

15:12.520 --> 15:16.600
um inherit your dad's account

15:16.600 --> 15:23.800
um but I so these are like the majority of the games I

15:23.800 --> 15:29.720
remember I'm gonna do like tons of xbox games I'm an xbox kid I never had a

15:29.720 --> 15:36.440
PlayStation at all um so I didn't have access

15:36.440 --> 15:41.080
I had a PlayStation my dad got a PlayStation 1

15:41.080 --> 15:47.160
I didn't know how to read like no

15:47.720 --> 15:52.200
yeah so I I'm just trying to think like the timeline

15:52.200 --> 15:58.600
a lot of these games I played I didn't even have the ability to read yet

15:58.600 --> 16:02.440
like I used to watch my dad play the games because I was so small

16:02.440 --> 16:07.080
um but yeah basically

16:07.080 --> 16:10.120
sonic generation

16:10.120 --> 16:15.240
is sonic generation someone that was made after sonic heroes

16:15.240 --> 16:19.240
uh I've not played bio shock 2 no I played bio shock 1

16:19.240 --> 16:24.760
where you had bees bees um

16:24.760 --> 16:32.920
my sweet little bumblebee I know what you want from me

16:32.920 --> 16:37.240
um hypnosis themed feature where I really like hypnosis I've never done it

16:37.240 --> 16:40.600
before but I'm going to participate it and try and get it for you

16:40.600 --> 16:45.240
uh I never played sonic generation then no I played sonic heroes and then there

16:45.240 --> 16:49.320
was a bit of a skip I played sonic unleash where he's like that werewolf

16:49.320 --> 16:54.360
but I got stuck on the game because I was like too young

16:54.440 --> 16:57.400
not very smart I'm not a very smart gamer okay

16:57.400 --> 17:01.160
which is why I am perfectly happy with

17:01.160 --> 17:04.840
hand-holding through games uh some streamers really don't like backseat

17:04.840 --> 17:08.440
gaming for me absolutely do not mind it I'm

17:08.440 --> 17:13.160
daft okay I'm completely daft I have no clue what's going on

17:13.160 --> 17:15.400
okay

17:16.440 --> 17:22.200
we'd be hypnotized to vote for you as president oh my god

17:22.200 --> 17:26.840
um but yes we're definitely going to replay a lot of xbox games as my

17:26.840 --> 17:33.560

18:10.920 --> 18:16.520
I too um the best halo game in your opinion

18:16.520 --> 18:20.600
I'm biased I'm going to say combat evolved because my dad used to play it

18:20.600 --> 18:24.280
like over and over and I used to hide behind the couch

18:24.280 --> 18:28.280
I was so scared from the grumpy oneies they were like so

18:28.280 --> 18:32.040
scary you actually finished meat boy that looked like I

18:32.040 --> 18:35.400

they're straight up what in the strip club straight up binding it and by it

19:05.000 --> 19:09.800

19:09.800 --> 19:13.400
replace the a with a f and then it says fart

19:13.400 --> 19:18.280
relax snowflake it's called dark humor it's my favorite

19:22.280 --> 19:28.760
uh I've also got um those old games uh from the xbox original days

19:28.760 --> 19:31.720

tizmo enough because it's lord of the rings lord of the rings

20:11.160 --> 20:16.840
related to play it and the entire time I want to do golem's voice and I'm like

20:16.840 --> 20:21.080
thank you I like absolutely wreck my voice to like

20:21.080 --> 20:26.600

20:26.600 --> 20:31.640
I'd love to do that my face when I didn't realize madness returns to the sequel

20:31.640 --> 20:37.640
oh mercy I'm about to ruin your day uh there was a third installment called

20:37.640 --> 20:43.240
uh alice uh asylum and EA rejected it the game has been fully

20:43.240 --> 20:48.440
conceptualized EA rejected it and now it's gathering dust

20:48.440 --> 20:52.920
so that's just to ruin your day there is to be a third installment of alice in

20:52.920 --> 20:55.800
wonderland and EA yet again ruined it

20:55.800 --> 21:02.040
yay do we hear yeah yeah we hear yeah so yeah it's

21:02.040 --> 21:08.360
hard to ruin your day but that's true um what other games uh dishonored was

21:08.360 --> 21:14.840
good um stealth was a bit funny at times but definitely happy to play that game

21:14.840 --> 21:20.360
um I'm gonna burp I'm so sorry oh no I'm not I don't have to be professional

21:20.360 --> 21:22.920
anymore

21:26.920 --> 21:31.320
it's carambit oh my god what a terrible man

21:31.320 --> 21:37.960
um I heard monster hunter uh hi dimpo again how's it going dimpo

21:37.960 --> 21:42.440
um I've heard monster hunter has bagpipes in it

21:42.440 --> 21:46.840
like as a weapon but it's the most like hardest thing to play instead of like a

21:46.840 --> 21:53.960
sword um dishonored good yeah good I'm drawing

21:53.960 --> 21:58.520
well watching you did you guys know that dimpo

21:58.520 --> 22:02.200
created her own vtuber art model isn't that amazing

22:02.200 --> 22:08.600
that's like literally so talented um talented as in terms of all her hard

22:08.600 --> 22:11.160
work and effort and blood sweat and tears that she's put into

22:11.160 --> 22:16.680
honing her craft and art so I read this thing ages ago about art as being like

22:16.680 --> 22:19.720
um we don't really like it when you say it's like overnight talent because it's

22:19.720 --> 22:23.880
not it's like you you honed your craft and like you should be proud of honing

22:23.880 --> 22:26.600
your craft you didn't just spawn in as an artist you know

22:26.600 --> 22:31.240
gifted that's it you're not gifted you honed your craft you spent years on it

22:31.240 --> 22:36.040
you got your xp bar raised up anyway that's just my small rant about being

22:36.040 --> 22:41.640
nice to artists they aren't gifted they have spent years specializing

22:41.640 --> 22:47.080

I will explain it all I'm actually making a video essay about Assassin's

25:14.120 --> 25:16.520
Creed brotherhood um it's going to be one of my

25:16.520 --> 25:19.400
donor-thon rewards I've already recorded the footage

25:19.400 --> 25:22.760
to do it I just need to write the script and everything

25:22.760 --> 25:27.080

25:27.080 --> 25:33.000
I'm like gonna fill Tezmo unless okay we've been on games for quite a while now

25:33.000 --> 25:36.440
I'm like um you guys are probably sick of staring at these games

25:36.440 --> 25:41.720
um I did that no I think I've done this wrong

25:41.720 --> 25:44.360
hey hello

25:44.520 --> 25:48.360
uh I think I said all the game stream said yeah oh we're playing old-school

25:48.360 --> 25:53.000
Rinscape 8 hour Assassin's Creed brotherhood lore

25:53.000 --> 25:56.040
coming in what have I done probably like

25:56.040 --> 26:00.680
less than an hour but um

26:00.680 --> 26:05.320
yes probably uh old-school Rinscape uh is our weekend game it's going to be

26:05.320 --> 26:09.480
mostly a multiplayer game for this month until

26:09.480 --> 26:17.880
June 19th when the Eldon wait why the fuck is there two

26:17.880 --> 26:23.800
oh I must have missed one um you've never played Rinscape don't worry

26:23.800 --> 26:29.160
we're doing questing my only problem with old-school Rinscape is

26:29.160 --> 26:32.760
I think you have to pay the premium experience for premium

26:32.760 --> 26:36.120
or we're all just going to get shafted playing that game like

26:36.120 --> 26:39.880
not in a good way um but yes Eldon Ring

26:39.880 --> 26:44.040
Eldon Ring DLC comes out on the 19th and then the multiplayer game for like

26:44.040 --> 26:46.920
four days in a row I'm doing multiplayer games

26:46.920 --> 26:50.760
you need to teach me old-school Rinscape literally I just go like fishing

26:50.840 --> 26:54.360
the back of Lumbridge let me castle not the back

26:54.360 --> 26:59.720
next to the main but south of the castle um

26:59.720 --> 27:05.160
but I uh what was that single word of fun oh uh probably four days of multiplayer

27:05.160 --> 27:09.320
Eldon Ring and then I have a very unique stream come in

27:09.320 --> 27:12.920
with the first collab outside of Vealor at the end of the month

27:12.920 --> 27:20.520
with a feature called Sin Sister and we may or may not have both purchased

27:20.520 --> 27:24.680
shock collars which we will give each other control of the shock collars

27:24.680 --> 27:28.840
and we are going to play multiplayer Eldon Ring and whoever causes us

27:28.840 --> 27:33.560
to die whichever one causes us to die gets to shock them

27:33.560 --> 27:38.680
basically yep we are we're doing that um I believe

27:38.680 --> 27:42.760
Sheebie is also getting a shock collar so I might have some sort of stream with

27:42.760 --> 27:48.520
her relating to that uh I use a shock collar for

27:49.000 --> 27:51.720

33:36.200 --> 33:42.040

mascots all the mascots were made um if you didn't know uh the reason I'll heal

33:51.560 --> 33:55.720
your throat your tentacles please the reason why

33:58.200 --> 34:05.240
reeflings have a patch on their head is a nicotine patch to help you with your

34:05.960 --> 34:10.360
addiction because we have an addiction to one each one of you to each other

34:17.320 --> 34:20.920
yeah so that's why you have a nicotine patch and you have lovely tentacles

34:20.920 --> 34:23.960
I've already got lots of suspicious artwork of us together but it's for

34:23.960 --> 34:26.760
November so I can't post it yeah to match it I've

34:26.760 --> 34:32.760
absolutely cooked on the lores um background yeah I love my room uh odd

34:32.760 --> 34:37.080
top was such a good sport I literally sent them a DM I'm like

34:37.080 --> 34:41.080
hey can you base it off of sonic ost and you go

34:41.080 --> 34:46.520
um waltz with me he did my little banner that's on twitter which is really good

34:46.520 --> 34:48.520
absolutely do it

34:50.280 --> 34:54.440
Azura could help you all with her healing properties um

34:56.760 --> 35:04.040
uh oh really yeah small sushi she did great um small sushi actually she did

35:04.040 --> 35:09.160
fantastic because she the girls weren't fully conceptualized when she created

35:09.160 --> 35:14.600
them I basically just gave descriptions which was really rough I know you

35:14.600 --> 35:21.080
haven't seen my stingers for my scene transitions I hate stingers I spent like

35:21.080 --> 35:28.520
200 dollars and I don't even want to use them I like I bought it obviously I bought

35:28.520 --> 35:33.160
it for everyone else but I'm like why did I spend that money on me no one feel

35:33.160 --> 35:37.640
well I don't like using stingers I like just went straight into it and like my

35:37.640 --> 35:43.640
loading screen was so expensive actually Yuri you may cooked with the loading

35:43.640 --> 35:48.440
screen she's actually making another alternative version because I had to do

35:48.440 --> 35:53.800
that cover-up thing but that was very expensive as well

35:53.800 --> 35:57.880
I just like when I get into it and then obviously why I picked my gen

35:57.880 --> 36:04.600
mate yeah that was so fun to do um like everyone's like oh this is my first

36:04.600 --> 36:10.120
impressions no mother fucker I picked them

36:10.120 --> 36:19.160
are so fun it was so fun being able to say that and being like yeah yeah absolutely

36:23.000 --> 36:28.120
evil strongy be like I always use stingers I love stingers I love when v-tubers

36:28.120 --> 36:32.200
have 10 minutes of stream starting soon at the start of their streams perish

36:32.200 --> 36:37.240
absolutely perish nonsense I'm starting up on a brotherhood at the menu

36:37.240 --> 36:44.120
tomorrow mark my words um but yes

36:44.120 --> 36:48.440
uh I was just fantastic the girls

36:48.440 --> 36:52.200
it's hard to judge people when they apply because

36:52.200 --> 36:59.160
it just felt really um we're weird

36:59.880 --> 37:02.440
hold on

37:03.480 --> 37:10.840
hold on um yeah it felt weird trying to put put them on because some of them said

37:10.840 --> 37:16.520
put me on any model some of them said I wanted a specific model I think Azura

37:16.520 --> 37:19.080
got who she wanted

37:21.560 --> 37:24.600
she'd be

37:25.080 --> 37:32.680
um Mercy wanted AC AC wanted AC so AC got AC

37:32.680 --> 37:36.680
Amy did you see anyone

37:38.680 --> 37:42.360
anyway it's impossible to give people the outline that they wanted because they

37:42.360 --> 37:46.200
couldn't even see it like it is they couldn't even see it it was just an

37:46.200 --> 37:51.560
outline um did you have any awkward or weird

37:51.560 --> 37:57.080
applications uh someone's intro video was

37:57.080 --> 38:01.480
30 seconds uh for anyone watching if you're

38:01.480 --> 38:07.080
serious about joining a vtuber agency uh what you're supposed to roughly do

38:07.080 --> 38:11.720
in uh application introduction video is to say

38:11.720 --> 38:15.640
your accolades whatever you achieved as a streamer prior to

38:15.640 --> 38:20.600
what you're doing now so you mention how often you stream do you stream three

38:20.600 --> 38:24.040
times a week consistently good thing to mention

38:24.040 --> 38:30.360
um 30 seconds uh just it was like hi i'm

38:30.360 --> 38:34.280
and i stream on and that was it and i was like bro what am i supposed to do with

38:34.280 --> 38:37.880
that um but yeah you're supposed to say

38:37.880 --> 38:41.960
your accolades what you want to achieve within the agency is a good thing

38:41.960 --> 38:47.080
to mention um you're also supposed to pass the

38:47.160 --> 38:51.480
test where you say hi vealer at the start because that means you read the

38:51.480 --> 38:56.200
instructions properly if you didn't start with hi vealer

38:56.200 --> 39:01.240
um i didn't close your application right away i gave you a chance but it's kind

39:01.240 --> 39:07.400
of one of those tests where those who did it i know you read

39:07.400 --> 39:13.960
those who didn't either you forgot although i say that i mean the girls

39:13.960 --> 39:18.120
have given me permission to kind of talk about that the thing

39:18.120 --> 39:21.960
azura's application was unprofessional

39:21.960 --> 39:25.800
fuck i'm not even going to be around the bush with azura

39:25.800 --> 39:31.640
she gave me permission to talk about it in her intro like her introduction

39:31.640 --> 39:36.920
she's like hey i'm azura and she was like i really don't like pickles

39:36.920 --> 39:41.160
and i don't like mustard and i was i'm like azura this is your

39:41.160 --> 39:45.080
introduction video you're supposed to like tell me things you've achieved

39:45.080 --> 39:48.280
she's like yeah i don't like the taste of these certain foods

39:48.280 --> 39:52.200
and i was like you're perfect for the hag and you come

39:52.200 --> 39:58.040
like you're perfect for the doting hag that we've got like no competition

39:58.040 --> 40:05.800
um uh i say doesn't even english isn't even her first language

40:05.800 --> 40:12.440
she had the most professional uh application she had these

40:12.440 --> 40:20.040
massive paragraphs serious answers uh immi was a dafty she

40:20.040 --> 40:23.880
freaking forgot to edit one part of her application

40:23.880 --> 40:29.400
and in one of the answers she was like i want to diddle the other girls and i'm

40:29.400 --> 40:33.240
like i knew it was an oversight because everything else was professional i'm

40:33.240 --> 40:38.280
like any one earth have you put um

40:38.280 --> 40:44.280
she be she failed the high vealour

40:44.280 --> 40:50.280
mercy um must have watched her introduction video like

40:50.280 --> 40:55.640
30 times over she was so like she went above and beyond

40:55.640 --> 41:01.080
she actually created icy um like recreated her outline and named her and all

41:01.080 --> 41:06.680
that pocha emmi left that on purpose

41:06.680 --> 41:12.200
yeah um the introduction video gives me a very

41:12.200 --> 41:14.920
good hint to what kind of each of her you are

41:14.920 --> 41:19.160
no what kind of person you are because there's one thing to stream

41:19.160 --> 41:22.840
but when you're talking directly to someone who's assessing you

41:22.840 --> 41:30.120
you act a bit different um and yes it was very interesting

41:30.120 --> 41:33.480
i got serenaded so much so i don't know why i'm

41:33.480 --> 41:37.560
frol blinking and let me just give me one second

41:37.560 --> 41:42.600
we're totally not recalibrating the old mech hold on

41:46.920 --> 41:51.480
that's better calibration um

41:51.480 --> 41:55.240
yeah i got serenaded so many people were singing i'm like you don't have to sing

41:55.240 --> 41:59.480
to be in this agency you just need a one cover song that's it

41:59.480 --> 42:04.200
i'm not gonna force you to sing um

42:04.200 --> 42:07.560
probably

42:08.360 --> 42:14.360
one of the most frustrating things was we asked to have streaming history

42:14.360 --> 42:18.840
and people's evidence of like being a streamer was like a link to their twitter

42:18.840 --> 42:21.720
and no other thing oh no content creator that was the

42:21.720 --> 42:26.040
terminology used you had to be a content creator and it was like

42:26.040 --> 42:29.800
are you okay why are you linking your twitter twitter isn't content

42:29.800 --> 42:33.560
there weren't even a v-tweet or anything like that and it was just like

42:33.560 --> 42:37.400
rub are the girls doing more songs yes

42:37.400 --> 42:40.200
100% uh if the girls want to pursue more singing they just

42:40.200 --> 42:46.760
come and me tell me what they want to do uh and i get that she don't

42:46.760 --> 42:53.960
uh well other things obviously i'm not gonna say anything private um

42:53.960 --> 42:57.880
i'm very flattered there were some very big names that applied

42:57.880 --> 43:01.880
but they just weren't a good fit or they already had a pre-established brand and

43:01.880 --> 43:05.000
it was like is this really what you want

43:05.000 --> 43:09.560
i think you just wanted i think some people that were very

43:09.560 --> 43:14.760
notoriet had high notoriety were interested more in the manager side

43:14.760 --> 43:21.480
of things than actually being that velar we had like one person was

43:21.480 --> 43:27.800
freaking massive and they were like can i keep my ip and join you and i'm like

43:27.800 --> 43:33.960
sorry i need to own the rights to the models in order to do what we need to

43:33.960 --> 43:40.200
okay it was a shame because i'm sure that person would have done just fine but

43:40.200 --> 43:49.000
yeah it was it's not possible to not have the ip and utilize the gills

43:49.640 --> 43:55.880
yes it was in the facts on the page um yeah the website got so many

43:55.880 --> 43:59.080
fucking questions that were answered on the website

43:59.080 --> 44:04.120
so they had to ignore the tab that had all the information

44:04.120 --> 44:08.600
to go to the contact part of the website

44:08.600 --> 44:15.080
to then ask the question that was already on the website

44:15.080 --> 44:21.080
um literally i tried so hard to make that shit be as

44:21.080 --> 44:24.440
comprehensible as possible

44:24.440 --> 44:27.240
um

44:27.240 --> 44:33.160
yes i think the applicants definitely read through it all

44:33.160 --> 44:35.400
uh

44:35.400 --> 44:39.240
brief time oh i can't see that sorry sorry i'm not uh that's the quote it's a

44:39.240 --> 44:43.240
code name code name i did not say that word please don't get on me

44:43.240 --> 44:46.520
um

44:46.600 --> 44:52.120
um i'm just trying to think back if there's anything notable on the

44:52.120 --> 44:58.120
applications oh my god there was one application

44:58.120 --> 45:06.680
she was outrageous outrageous if you apply to an agency that agency

45:06.680 --> 45:11.080
watches your content this girl my goodness

45:11.080 --> 45:16.600
she applied i went on her twitter her twitch to listen to her live to check

45:16.600 --> 45:22.520
her out and all that she admitted in the next

45:22.520 --> 45:26.840
live stream oh i'd only do via lure for one year and then

45:26.840 --> 45:31.240
bring the my audience over to this account

45:31.240 --> 45:37.240
why would you admit that i'm very happy to say i never even considered her

45:37.240 --> 45:43.480
but oh my god how could you be so like i don't even know what the word is

45:43.480 --> 45:47.800
i was gobsmacked like i sent it to other members of the team

45:47.800 --> 45:51.560
to make sure i heard what i heard was correct

45:51.560 --> 45:56.760
but they outright said yeah i would just do it for one year and then bring my

45:56.760 --> 45:59.720
audience over

46:01.640 --> 46:05.800

46:05.800 --> 46:12.600

46:22.600 --> 46:25.640
patreon or monetization streams when the girls get

46:25.640 --> 46:29.880

46:29.880 --> 46:34.600
one to even apply to do it in the first place knowing you have no commitment

46:35.080 --> 46:38.920

47:22.440 --> 47:28.840
85 85 to them 15 to the agency and they also get an alternative outfit on us

47:28.840 --> 47:32.200
they do not pay for it we pay for it

47:32.200 --> 47:35.240

right i'm gonna open up marshmallow because this time i can answer questions

48:42.920 --> 48:46.840
please keep my yukata on i don't know what later did it but i can actually

48:46.840 --> 48:50.440
answer marshmallows that are um

48:50.440 --> 48:55.080
why are you so cute stop it my voice is so freaking broken

48:55.080 --> 48:58.360
me

48:58.360 --> 49:03.240
have you considered streaming elsewhere yes the girls are allowed to stream on

49:03.240 --> 49:07.720
an alternative website at a later date please understand we are trying to

49:07.720 --> 49:12.120
establish yourself on youtube at first and we have monetization on youtube and

49:12.120 --> 49:17.320
the girls income is all sorted but yes there are plans i will make it free

49:17.320 --> 49:21.960
access um

49:22.520 --> 49:26.440
i do not believe in charging any further than

49:26.440 --> 49:31.880
um youtube membership and patreon so all together is

49:31.880 --> 49:35.800
999 for your oh shi desu to support because it

49:35.800 --> 49:42.200
is it is 199 for emotes to make sure no one gets gifted membership

49:42.200 --> 49:46.440
and then is it 499 or is it 399

49:47.400 --> 49:49.720
my voice is

49:50.600 --> 49:56.040
is it 4999 for membership usually

49:56.040 --> 50:01.640
is 499 yeah 4999 seen agreeable okay 199 for tier 1 499 yeah that sounds

50:01.640 --> 50:05.560
right that sounds right um as long as you guys don't think it's outrageous

50:05.560 --> 50:09.480
like in the state each um as i've said in the vealer

50:09.480 --> 50:13.480
smoothstream we are undercutting the market

50:13.480 --> 50:18.920
um i'm not even going to pretend otherwise uh on the vea side of things

50:18.920 --> 50:22.840
most vea's start at $10 for two exclusive audios

50:22.840 --> 50:26.600
we are undercutting the market by doing four audios for $5

50:26.600 --> 50:30.680
and no price increase at all is planned and if you

50:30.680 --> 50:33.640
fell ever so inclined you can donate more via

50:33.640 --> 50:38.280
donate you can support more via patreon there is a secondary

50:38.280 --> 50:46.040
tier that uh it's $20 i believe um i haven't put anything else

50:46.040 --> 50:53.160
um yes what's your history with hypnosis i'm learning i'm a new baby

50:53.160 --> 50:57.400
um but i'm going to give it my best shot i have a very

50:57.400 --> 51:01.720
uh deep interest in it i've just never actually made content about it like

51:01.720 --> 51:07.160
straight up uh it's not expensive yes i

51:14.360 --> 51:18.440
oh i really i've heard some stories around that it was going to be

51:18.440 --> 51:23.800
five for standard and 20 oh no no we're undercutting the market five

51:23.800 --> 51:28.760
dollars and you get four four audios per month

51:28.760 --> 51:33.400
um are you concerned undercutting could cause a scene

51:33.400 --> 51:37.480
wide price shift downwards uh no because prices are going up

51:37.480 --> 51:45.000
everywhere um following the voice actress trends

51:45.000 --> 51:48.760
um on the ASMR side of things and the the roleplay side of things

51:48.760 --> 51:53.080
prices are only going up uh and i believe in the opposite i believe in

51:53.080 --> 51:57.400
delivering both quality and quantity um without

51:57.400 --> 52:00.680
overworking the girls please understand that management uh have

52:00.680 --> 52:06.120
dictated the scripts for a couple of months however

52:06.120 --> 52:09.960
um there's few girls interested in writing their scripts i'm also very

52:09.960 --> 52:13.480
open to writing scripts live unfortunately will be a membership

52:13.480 --> 52:17.320
stream uh for me content wise to give you guys exactly

52:17.320 --> 52:21.000
what you're looking for um but please understand i cannot pigeon

52:21.000 --> 52:25.240
hold the girls into doing the same thing over and over again

52:25.240 --> 52:29.960
just rehashed that's not that's not um

52:29.960 --> 52:33.560
that is no way for them to be set up for success that is

52:33.560 --> 52:38.680
they will be set up for failure sadly if i did that and i really hope

52:38.680 --> 52:43.560
yeah have you written any scripts yet yeah you listen to them

52:43.560 --> 52:46.920
everything you look that's out right now on patreon is done by me

52:46.920 --> 52:53.160
the two other script writers kicking i want to say roughly in three months

52:53.160 --> 52:59.400
and then the manager for the scripts is about to kick in

52:59.400 --> 53:04.840
i don't know quite what's happening yet if they'll write the majority

53:04.840 --> 53:09.000
um this is just my humble opinion but because

53:09.000 --> 53:15.720
i don't have my scripts do not come out as best

53:15.720 --> 53:21.480
as if a man had written it that's just my opinion

53:21.480 --> 53:27.320
um the emi has shown interest in a script shibi has shown interest in

53:27.320 --> 53:31.640
writing i think azura prefers the help

53:31.640 --> 53:39.160
azura um i think she needs reassurance ac

53:39.160 --> 53:44.200
ac is good at improv i think she may do some improv scripts in the

53:44.200 --> 53:48.920
future uh yeah

53:49.080 --> 53:57.080
what is the adult aspect to the agency uh the alternate alt twitters and uh

53:57.080 --> 54:04.840
patreon yeah azura did you just did

54:05.560 --> 54:10.600
i eventually want to be a member for the girls you girls they're they're fine

54:10.600 --> 54:15.160
uh yeah i'll kind of repeat this if you like are in a position where you can

54:15.160 --> 54:19.720
support like a like one girl please think about supporting

54:19.720 --> 54:26.200
the other girls over me um i am living a very good life um

54:26.200 --> 54:31.720
and things are going very well please don't worry about me okay

54:31.720 --> 54:35.640
how do you find the alternate of twitters

54:36.360 --> 54:42.920
check who they're following yeah check it check who they're following

54:42.920 --> 54:46.040
question about your design how did you come up with the twin tails and the

54:46.040 --> 54:51.080
candy pee is seashells i'm a cuttlefish i'm i'm a cbtuber

54:51.080 --> 54:56.200
uh these are cuttlefish uh sorry these are seashells

54:56.200 --> 55:02.360
uh and then i got double bunches um i love symmetrical hair and i love bunches

55:02.360 --> 55:05.320
so i've got double bunches

55:05.800 --> 55:13.800
um would you be open to accepting script submissions

55:13.800 --> 55:17.560
absolutely i don't know how to set it up i don't know how to do it and i don't

55:17.560 --> 55:23.240
know i need i would need to like give a guide because

55:23.240 --> 55:31.720
it's quite hard to get it all efficient and good to go

55:31.800 --> 55:36.440
definitely open to it please do let us cook though like literally the dust is

55:36.440 --> 55:39.800
settling the girls are about to start doing game streams after these two

55:39.800 --> 55:45.800
point ohs um the first week i did request the girls to

55:45.800 --> 55:50.120
stream as much as they're physically able to without cancelling streams i have

55:50.120 --> 55:54.200
emphasised to them that cancelling streams

55:54.200 --> 55:57.880
try your best to not over promise it's better to

55:57.880 --> 56:04.920
take a day off than it is to um plan a stream that you think you can do and

56:04.920 --> 56:10.760
then you get too tired and cancel it because cancelling streams is very

56:10.760 --> 56:14.440
people plan people plan their time and their days and their energy

56:14.440 --> 56:17.720
around a stream if they know what time it's coming on and it's very valuable

56:17.720 --> 56:23.640
to respect people's time so like for reeflands for example you guys know

56:23.640 --> 56:29.880
that i don't stop streaming like at all and i'm always there and i literally

56:29.880 --> 56:34.600
have never cancelled the stream so and that's true i haven't cancelled the

56:34.600 --> 56:37.000
stream

56:38.840 --> 56:43.400
um sorry to tell you just to bring the topic back gifted membership is the one

56:43.400 --> 56:48.280
that's closest to five dollars yeah you may have to go higher

56:48.840 --> 56:54.200
eh it's all i thought gifted membership went to the lowest tier tier one was

56:54.200 --> 56:59.640
going to be emotes only and then tier two is going to be four ninety nine

56:59.640 --> 57:05.720
i really don't want to overcharge so there is gonna

57:10.360 --> 57:13.880
well wait more streams uh yeah i stream all day every eight

57:13.880 --> 57:21.000
maybe just make it an extra dollar it's expensive though

57:21.640 --> 57:26.920
who goes there by the pope identify yourself

57:27.480 --> 57:32.840
um how do you prevent any mischief from the talents

57:32.840 --> 57:36.200
uh i know they're responsible adults but from a legal span

57:36.200 --> 57:40.360
standpoint how do you prevent any possible uh repercussions of the

57:40.360 --> 57:43.640
talents actions does the company not take responsibility

57:43.640 --> 57:50.040
or do they do create freedom um i literally said in the interview you're

57:50.040 --> 57:53.480
not going to get in trouble i'm not your mum i couldn't give less of two shits

57:53.480 --> 57:57.400
what you do um i basically said the only thing i

57:57.400 --> 58:03.800
ask you not to do is release any nda content and um

58:03.800 --> 58:07.560
you know don't say the n word you know basic adult

58:07.560 --> 58:12.920
stuff it's pretty much it i mean i don't know what else to tell you

58:12.920 --> 58:16.040
when you treat adults like adults they act like adults

58:16.040 --> 58:18.520
it's crazy

58:22.360 --> 58:27.640
did you hypnotize the girls to become the characters

58:27.640 --> 58:32.200
eh i hope you're drinking a lot soda i'm i'm going cola it's fizzy juice

58:32.200 --> 58:35.960
actually sorry you're turning scots it's not cold it's not uh

58:35.960 --> 58:41.640
soda it's fizzy juice um yes

58:43.080 --> 58:46.200
um as for repercussions like as i said we don't do

58:46.200 --> 58:50.600
um suspensions however i did warn them i said

58:50.600 --> 58:56.200
does it mean you're allowed free reign like we can cut we can terminate

58:56.200 --> 58:59.880
obviously we don't want to do that and no girl has given any indication of any

58:59.880 --> 59:03.640
of that shit thank god yeah i have full faith in these

59:03.640 --> 59:07.880
girls i've known them for two months now like no issues not one issue has

59:07.880 --> 59:12.760
popped up um

59:12.760 --> 59:16.760
oh yeah fizzy juice is how you say it in scotland fizzy

59:16.760 --> 59:21.960
are you a hire up in the agency nah i said don't call me boss

59:21.960 --> 59:26.120
um i basically

59:26.840 --> 59:31.160
got their script started but it's going to script manager

59:31.160 --> 59:36.120
and i don't have to do any work i get to stream all day long

59:36.120 --> 59:39.800
um

59:41.240 --> 59:45.320
yeah so i'm kind of asked about gentle uh year away bro

59:45.320 --> 59:50.840
year away do you plan on doing movie watch alongs absolutely

59:50.840 --> 59:54.440
will you ever do a deep sea creature list oh my god yeah that's so good that's a

59:54.440 --> 59:59.320
good idea i like that i was gonna uh so this is a failed

59:59.320 --> 01:00:03.560
stream idea i was actually gonna um order a like a cuttlefish

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.320
it wouldn't be alive but i wanted to explore the biology of it because

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.520
i think they're pretty cool like cephalopods are pretty cool

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.440
and i wanted to like show you guys like if i was a cuttle

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.720
it's a little looks good but i think people would find it a bit more bit

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:24.120
than like essentially playing with a dead body so yeah probably can do that

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.840
i've not played subnautica i don't have a memory of playing it

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.080
um uh could give it a good shot

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:41.160
could recommend it but it's for science

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:49.000
cephalopog for memes for memes cephalopog sorry

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.840

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.920

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.680
hey

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:46.840
as long as i respect them actually use it for educational content

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.760
yeah i like biology but i think people find it quite morbid sometimes

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.320
and i don't want to upset anyone

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.000
can't believe you're already taking advantage of it

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.360
you like it really i've mistaken advantage of yeah

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.160
what a refund

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.800
tentacles i don't have any tentacles

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:20.040
i may get tentacles another time but i don't have tentacles

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.720
i feel like if i had tentacles they would come out with my

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.240
i'm gonna be honest i don't think they would be tail tailbone attached

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.560
i think they would come out my other end

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.720
out of all the girls who do you think is gonna overwork themselves for sheebie

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.000
and sheebie's already done so much work in advance

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.360
um so she can focus on streams

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.400
the tentacles not be around you

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.840

slipper wielding i hate the only thing i don't like about

marshmallow is that it cuts words in the middle

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:35.960

um me me on reflex oh my god i need to make a reflex post

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.480
on my alternate and my voice is so loud

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.560
mummy thank you for giving me a little sister you talked prior during the

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:10.280
selection process about keeping a list uh a list of possible candidates so

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:14.600
um i got my first choice for everyone i don't know how

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.960
but everyone was like first choice pick i wanted them in the agency they came in

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:25.560
the agency there were i would say like eight people

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:32.920
that were like fall back obviously azura didn't have one that was a problem

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:38.360
emi i was actually really worried she wouldn't accept her lore

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.040
she likes it

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.760
i was worried that she wouldn't accept the lore

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:51.400
and it's like yeah that's fine i don't care i'm like okay and then jeez she's

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:56.920
i was worried she wouldn't accept that but that's okay um

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:02.040
have any japanese corpos influenced your decision making

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.600
why do you believe there was no lid one before

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:13.560
uh no idea probably because you need someone who's done it

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.800
before to even understand like what to do and a lot of

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.680
guy owned corporations like in the nicest way most likely haven't been

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.680
streamers before and don't comprehend what you're asking people to do

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.800
like uh i kind of spoke about this a wee bit in the last

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:35.400
stream like that 80 20 split in order to motivate people you have to let them

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:39.000
earn what they're worth if you turn around and say to them

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.720
for every 100 dollars uh you're getting you know 20 bucks out of it you're

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.520
getting 50 bucks out of it like all that girl is going to be doing is

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:52.280
sitting there saying oh wow i could have made the full

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.480
hundred on my alt account oh wow i could have done this on my previous

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.280
life like that's all that they're going to sit there and think

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:03.880
okay like i'm we talking pure business baby i'm happy to talk pure

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.680
business if you want um

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.120
well the monthly audio releases be revealed before the month starts yes

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:19.080
and we need to get on top of that sadly there was a few issues

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.760
production wise with a few things i'm so surprised

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.960
turns out uh takes a lot of time to make these things happen

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:31.960
love artists but my fucking god can you not go over deadlines that'd be great

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:39.640
um but yes we will be posting monthly like what the tags are what the title

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.520
is um we just need to catch up like you need to give us time to breathe i'm

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.000
so sorry all i can ask is your patience and

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.600
unironically like bow emoji because uh we need time like it was

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:58.120
absolutely hectic on debut we were exhausted in that group

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:02.360
collab and like like i don't know if you

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:08.280
recognized like how fast we ended i was like right say bye to chat bye like

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.880
we all disappeared out that voice call so quickly i was like thank you guys so

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:17.480
much i'm gonna wait to pass out and then i ended up being really sick after it

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:21.000
um but yes we just need things to calm down

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.960
we're we're gonna ease into the first week everyone's got their games you get

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:29.400
to see their personalities more enjoy them more which is fantastic

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:36.840
um octopus i'm not an octopus i'm a codonfish

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:44.680
no call me octopus no call me squid i'm a cephalopod or a kurofish

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.680
better take your yourselves and now the things have calmed down like

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:55.240
the lead-up to debut is very nerve-racking like very very nerve-racking

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.600
i have finished my kola i will never start on

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.400
fame my warble

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.800
oh i strongly you're super good

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:15.400
hey you like my teeth is that what's doing it for you

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:20.040
um but i think i've called for for the question

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.760
oh no i lied is there a reason you went with youtube over

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.680
twitch yes i can manage the girls accounts from youtube i cannot manage

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.640
the girls accounts from twitch can't do a thing on twitch

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:38.920
management-wise um and twitch uh unfortunately are very sparse and

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.320
arbitrary when they uh throw the old band hammer down or

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:47.640
suspension hammer down uh really not a fan of twitch doing that

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.560
it's every week you see a girl being like twitch with a heck

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.240
i'm literally doing everything that everyone i'm doing stuff that everyone

01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:01.240
else does um like it just at least with youtube you

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.320
can like beg them on twitter for help or whatever

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.560
and twitch is inconsistent yeah let's see

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:13.880
uh would you dominate inkling

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.960
i've never played splatoon isn't actually good it's probably like the most

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.040
war-friendly game for me to play

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.160
um

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.920
how does managing account yeah so i have it sounds really bad but i don't do

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.680
anything on their accounts but um i can basically go on their

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:38.120
accounts and set up streams for them or approve of comments for them

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.840
um anything they want to help out really like um now that

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.000
debuts have happened the girls are like gonna be controlling all that stuff

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.600
like they'll be doing their live streams and stuff but in order to reduce

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:55.160
as much stress as possible and the girls i pretty much tried to do every single

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.280
little thing but now that we're past the debut

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.960
stage like they're they're gonna have to be big girls now and

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.400
you know put up their put up their little games

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.240
put up their streams and all that and update their description

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.560
like i was the one doing all that behind the scenes

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.640
um have you played pokemon yeah pokemon ruby

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.800
my childhood game um mudkip was my starter

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.080
they have to spread their big girl wings yes i like putting a message in the

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.040
discord i'm like i'm so sorry girls but the hand

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.880
holding kind of slows down now

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:39.160
um yeah say hello

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:45.160
it was torsik blaziken is so strong and so is mudkip mudkip's really strong as

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.880
well um mudkip's always used in speed runs for pokemon

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.720
ruby or emerald she doesn't know i want to collect

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.920
her ink oh my god inks on you strongy is mama bird but it's time for them to

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.800
flee the nest honestly like um i hope overall they

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:09.480
feel like less stressed like um they didn't have to think about the

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:13.000
lores or what they wanted to say everything was edited on their behalf

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.360
like they had to give the audios over but everything was done on their behalf

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:23.240
and because like i've heard stories of like other agencies like go to the

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:26.520
tablet right make up your lore we've ordered all the art but you make up the

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.360
lore by the way and it's like what you literally are handing me the model what

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.240
do you mean you've not thought this stuff and it was like quick come up with

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.120
a description of your character really quickly quick quick

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:42.040
uh and it's like what you you're giving me the model what do you mean i come

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.520
up with the stuff like that's the whole point of the model unless it would be

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.400
customized like it's like um

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.560
how did you end up managing them or are you new to the agency well i'm new to

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.600
being a manager i'm not even their manager i'm just a streamer that does it

01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:01.720
alongside them i just picked them but but me me now i want to

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.920
screen i'm fucking being a boss i ain't doing shit

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.920
um

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.920
yeah

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:18.280
um i know this isn't it someone said it someone said say purple burglar alarm

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.560
got it i knew someone was gonna say it i'll always guess this

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:27.400
right so in my like clear accent i say purple burglar alarm but if i say it

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.560
in a harsh scottish accent purple burglar alarm

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.000
like my tongue gets caught on the top of the roof of my mouth wait i'll mute

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.880
my background music so you can really hear it my my tongue gets caught

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:46.040
purple burglar alarm like ooh purple burglar alarm

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:52.440
you can hear my tongue getting caught say that

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.480
uh

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.720
what did you miss nothing it's just me meamin about

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.920
are you all trying to keep non conflicting schedules sadly it's not

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.800
possible when someone like me is on the team

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.320
um so whenever uh gen mate of mine goes live i will highly recommend you go

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.200
watch them because right now for example she'd be caught in bum is live

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.400
dinner 2.0 uh azura is coming on in roughly three hours

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:32.360
um but sadly i am an endurance streamer and the best time slot that i have

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.280
selected means i can go to doctor's appointments even if i do

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.800
um no i'm not dying before anyone freaking types that

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:45.320
i'm fine my health is good um uh it's all good don't worry

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:49.720
um but the time slot i have chosen means i can still go out to do

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.320
things like go shopping or to a doctor's appointment

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.080
or um you know go feed gammy you know how it is

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.320
i'm not dying stop my health is so much better

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:05.080
although i do have a sad story i mean i won't say it in 2.0

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.200
even though it's just all right well no i'll keep it to myself because it's a

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.680
bit sad and i don't i don't want to make you guys sad

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.800
like this is such a good happy time like holy fuck we're back

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.760
um after a year god damn that took so long to cook

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:24.840
but we're strongy cut with me that's just my name

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:31.320
admit it that's just my name um but yeah sadly i am an endurance

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:35.720
streamer which means weekly i will most likely have very long streams that are

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:41.960
not friendly to the majority of viewers please understand do not feel bad

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:46.040
um if you are unable to watch me live

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:51.880
um the other girls uh might be much more accessible to you time zone wise or

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.680
stream wise um i can still hear her

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:00.440
um but i play i absolutely do not feel insulted

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:06.600
at all if you cannot um you know keep up with me i'm not very friendly my

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.800
time zone isn't friendly i am aware of that and because i'm an

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.680
endurance streamer like tomorrow's stream is

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.960
literally eight hours long i'm not even kidding

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.320
we're doing the full playthrough of assassin's creed brotherhood

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.080
and then we're going back to 100% it because i've never 100%

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.440
in the dna sequence since assassin's creed brotherhood before

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.040
like that's what we're doing the next day what do you mean

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.680
i thought you just debuted

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:42.920
um so yeah that's uh why um whenever a gen mate goes live please you are more

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:47.000
than welcome to tell me i will direct you guys to the gen mate because i can't

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.600
redirect because my stream my gate if my stream isn't over

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:55.480
um so full point through first day is planned yes and then 100%

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.840
the next day i don't know how long it's gonna take but yeah

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:03.720
um eight hours isn't going to be the norm every single stream so like for

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.160
example oh for example

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:13.240
uh um for example needy streamer overload

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:19.160
um is two hours long i think i've never played the game before

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.400
i think it's just a click simulator type thing i'm not sure

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:28.840
um i've also got uh however actually um

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.680
james cameron's avatars an eight hour stream

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:39.400
sorry uh old school runescape is like 12 hours oh god

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.960
these are all so long like i've got to i need to make up for lost time

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:51.000
okay i need make up for lost time um not to mention uh once i get membership

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.440
once i get monetized i'm also doing membership streams

01:17:54.440 --> 01:18:00.600
on top of all of this um it's a more stream on saturday um

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.880
and then i'm trying foreign sweets it is gonna be

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:11.240
like a uh hand like a desk cam oh yeah oh you get to see my desk man

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:18.760
um when do you rest i will rest until i'm dead i've waited a year to be here

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:24.360
i have lost time to make up for um people have waited in cryo freeze for me

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:29.240
for a very long time and the way i say thank you is

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:33.080
rather than saying thank you is like doing it through content through ASMR

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:39.000
through collabs through everything so yeah

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.600
i'm making up for it oh no uh someone says don't burn out please

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.360
i have a secret for you i have this thing your honor

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:55.400
it's called rotism and it means i actually don't experience burnout

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.640
i don't experience it i basically go to sleep

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.320
and wake up the next day i'm ready to take on the world again

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:08.280
uh i've never really felt what burnout is the way people describe it

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:14.760
nope nope i think uh my autism has given me a buff um

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:19.960
and means i don't get burnout and i'm very excited to stream every single day

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:26.040
it's a superpower um yes for the foreign sweet stream again that's

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.880
hand cam you'll see my hands so if you don't like v-tubers that kind of

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:34.360
show a wee bit of the flesh uh do apologize i might not be for you

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.240
however do have gen mates that are a little shy

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:41.080
and i don't think they'll show themselves so please be patient i'm just

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:47.480
like oh someone send me a picture of my face with the hat right now

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:53.000
so i can make it my twitter profile picture right

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.880

strontism oh strontism is oh should that be my life tag

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:08.280
because i don't get burnt out strontism oh that's really bad though

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.160

e what do you think of sunken gallery

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.200
i'm not convinced

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:59.720
such probation i know i know i know i know was that the melody of legend of

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:12.200
zelda

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:17.560
um will you get multiple endings there's multiple endings

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.920
i've never played i actually don't know much about the game i thought it was

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.000
like you click buttons that's all i know

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.200
that you click buttons you'll never get i'm really good at

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.840
clicking buttons you know what i'm saying they're all bad endings

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.760
oh no there's tons of endings i thought it was like one of them

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.400
quick games

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.960
how did you end up getting to pick the talents

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:49.960
when you're just new to the agency zelda

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:53.560
because i'm the creative director

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.600
i'm the creative director

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.760
good ending is when you get your mask no

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.760
oh okay maybe take your mask

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.200
and the voices go away no don't take your mask i don't want to play elton ring

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:18.120
and then take my mask because then you guys all disappear

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.400
oh my god do you remember that time we played elton ring

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.320
and we all like we're mimicking something

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.880
and then someone came in and went banzai and blew it all up

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:33.960
that was amazing how big is the viewer game

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:37.960
i mean it depends if you want to count contractors as well

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.560
i guess it's pretty juicy if you want to count contractors

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.640
like we've literally got like four more technical clippers coming in

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:49.560
no one person's about to be on trial

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.560
two are like we want them full-time basically

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:58.440
so that adds more people to the website

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:01.640
do you count the talents as well that's another six then

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:05.800
technically if we disappear who will stream site

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.440
oh yeah one of you guys have to come in as the baddie

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.480
wait what's happening with my arm

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:14.280
what's happening with my arm

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:18.680
oh no i'm gonna have to know you about that

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:22.440
it's a bit too aggressive

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:26.760
are there any big group projects yes oh my god

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:30.680
there's such big group projects i'm so tired

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.720
i planned ahead i planned every month there's going to be

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:38.040
some sort of event going on at the allure

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:44.040
um leave my noodle arm i don't know why my arm breaking

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:47.400
i'll annoying nari about it nari was absolutely fantastic when she came to

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:52.040
construct in me she's fantastic um you plan on getting 3d models yes but

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.040
you're gonna have to put your money where your mouth is if you want to see the

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.960
girls 3d put your money where your mouth is give them

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:59.240
memberships uh go on them patrons because

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:04.520
that's expensive expensive because uh we would have to buy them the trackers as

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.800
well i actually don't know much about 3d in yet but i'm

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:12.440
pretty sure like you can be our chat model and we can all like

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.640
touch each other and stuff in there

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:22.440
uh will there be group audios yes there will be group

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:26.520
audios um there's already one-on-one audios planned

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:31.400
with each other but i didn't know the comfortability level of the girls when

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:35.880
we were like at that stage of development so so far

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:41.640
is hasura and sheepsters me and mersey and emmers and

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:45.240
icers um i've not done anything further i think

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:50.200
donathan rewards uh will most likely be targeted at that stuff and it'll be

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:55.720
access free to access um because i think public

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:59.960
donathan rewards are much more satisfactory obviously we will have to

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:04.040
do the classic uh like first place second place third

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:09.000
place um because we do need to incentivize and um

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.440
azura um uh might be in the position to move out if all

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:20.280
goes well and she gets the support um like monetary like gets monetized and

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.000
all that jazz and if she can move out she can definitely increase her like

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.840
stream times for years and uh just find a easier

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.640
time uh that's why i'm kind of like support the others

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.360
because like they're in positions where like oh if i could move out i could

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:35.400
definitely make more content stream for longer do this do that be more like

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.720
you know so definitely support them okay

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:44.280
can i drill it in your head anymore to support them or

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.720
then you like hypnotize you

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.720
oh my picture's on twitter right okay i'll get that i'll update it

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:56.200
and

01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:01.000
mm-hmm

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:06.440
oh no we did not have a vealer house a vealer house would be awesome actually

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:12.200
uh no the girls are like some of them are like still living with family or

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:16.760
and so they can't really be like oh like you know

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:21.160
all the time so yeah

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:26.200
we obey we support the girls but you kindly support the girl

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.080
so yeah um

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:36.920
that is why um so uh azure's up first for donathan rewards to kind of give you an

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:42.040
idea um i'm opening to you know farting about

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:46.440
and uh being open to like kind of the stuff you guys would like to see

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:50.280
perfectly fine with me no problem

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.960
um

01:32:54.040 --> 01:33:00.120
are the audios on patreon already done do you mean like edit

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:06.440
um only one month it's been done so like june is done so the girl's

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:10.120
responsibilities like contract wise is three streams a week

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:14.920
if health permitted oh my god if health permitted i got asked by one of the

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:19.480
girls i just azure was like did i need to give you a

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:25.160
doctor's note if i'm sick i'm like no go rest my goodness

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:30.840
you're not well you're not well um so if they're in good health they are to

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:35.000
stream a minimum of three times a week and monthly four audios

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.280
that's it i definitely do not want to overwork

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:41.720
anyone i do not want them to feel stressed i want them to have good times

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:49.800
good vibes uh happy ending uh yeah and they've been like super

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:54.760
patient and like the behind the scenes stuff going on

01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:00.440
uh do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:04.360
do you talk often with one each other yeah we're in a we're in a discord we talk

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:08.040
every day for two months we've like literally

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.920
talked every day um you know some some girls like might

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.760
feel like awkward around each other uh we had like a couple of gaming sessions

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.560
leading up to that uh we had mock streams together

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.920
i like wholeheartedly feel a hundred percent comfortable around these girls

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:27.480
um like when it comes to collabing with other vtubers outside the agency

01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:32.840
unfortunately for me personally i'm quite inappropriate and if i don't know the

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.000
person and i don't know their comfort level i'm not really interested in like

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.600
asking for like uh oh you want to do a vtuber club type thing

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:45.240
um so uh i'm probably not going to do too many

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:48.600
clubs out with the agency unless like the girls vouch for me

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:52.440
or something like i'm i'm happy to make friends with their friends

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:56.440
but um it's probably going to be solo content majority on

i'll be here all week storm cloaks yep don't care what they say

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:32.200
you know i'm all for talus praise be to talus

01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:36.040
um

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:39.720
so that's my duration game for next week is skyrim first

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:45.080
i believe it takes me just over 24 hours to do full achievements

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:49.880
um we kind of you kind of cheat at the start because you do if you do the

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.400
companions questline first and then go back to the save

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:58.360
before so you're not a werewolf and then do the vampire quest

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:05.880
the problem i don't know if it's gonna be a problem if i use

01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:13.640
um xbox pass for it because because um my xbox would break

01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:18.840
so many times trying to play skyrim because the save file issues

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:26.120
um and i i if it's going to be the same way then

01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:29.960
there's a strategical way to get full achievements via the xbox i already

01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:33.240
know how to do it i've done it a few times so don't worry i'll lay it all out

01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:35.880
for you baby i'll show you how to get full achievements in skyrim

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:40.040
in under 24 hours that'll be my challenge in under 24 hours

01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:44.120
i'm sure you can do it under way less but i i don't know the strength i'm not a

01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:47.000
speedrunner

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.800
he is i had a girl ghost me because i told her you picked the stormcloth

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:58.440
what why would anyone pick the legion sorry but the elves can perish you're

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:02.200
no coming into my home country being like no you're not allowed to

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:06.360
praise talos uh excuse me you can get

01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:14.040
people a bit of casual fantasy or racism don't mind me

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:17.640
absolutely i'm stormcloth all the way don't care

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:24.840
don't care don't care i know i'm right

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:27.240
um

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:34.040
being team instinct in pokemon go

01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:37.880
because if you always follow your instincts you'll get there in the end

01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:42.280
unironically i'm i'm team instinct oops i don't know what you guys are in

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.600
pokemon go but i'm team instinct and then the moment was like if you always

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:49.880
if you follow your instincts you'll always win because it doesn't mean you

01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:53.400
have to win or lose just follow how you feel

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:56.440
and life is good

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:01.800
because team mystic is for like wise people and then team red i've forgotten

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:08.280
their name uh is like for for like uh like i must win

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.920

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:18.600

01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:25.240
uh excuse me where are we placing sticks

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:33.960
