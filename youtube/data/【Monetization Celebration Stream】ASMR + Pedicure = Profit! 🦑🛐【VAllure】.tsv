398720	400720	What name? I'm too old to read one.

402720	405720	Oh, Bay Odex, Plastic Ghost.
405720	408720	I'm not going to actually have to do ASMR between them.
408720	411720	Oh my god, hold on.
411720	414720	There's a few tools like all that are like required,
414720	419720	real ambidextrous, but like crack pipes,
419720	423720	come on, oh shit.
423720	425720	Hold on, hold on, I can do this.
425720	429720	I'm actually having a problem with this toe, by the way.
429720	432720	I don't know what the lady did, but I think it's contracted
432720	434720	and I might have to go with the doctor about it,
434720	437720	because something's not right.
437720	440720	I cleaned the wound today,
440720	442720	and something's definitely not right,
442720	445720	but can we even get it to bloop?
445720	449720	Wait, hold on.
449720	451720	It's not blooping.
451720	453720	I can't do this.
453720	456720	It's a crazy amount of team effort to get this to bloop.
456720	458720	Hold on.
458720	460720	Oh, come on.
460720	465720	It's not turning over because of the way my feet are.
465720	469720	Oh my god, I figured it out.
469720	473720	Oh my god, a little toe just cracked.
473720	475720	Oh shit.
475720	478720	I'm going to be sorry if I get my dissent today.
478720	480720	That took me so long.
480720	483720	I also brought pop rocks to prove how sweaty my feet are.
483720	485720	I want to see if my feet sweat, can make them pop,
485720	488720	although just the feet sweat, nothing else.
488720	491720	I just realized I'm really covering that up,
491720	493720	so let me go over here.
493720	495720	Look, it's my feet.
495720	498720	Oh yeah, I also have a PC cleaner.
498720	502720	These are used for fan board type things,
502720	506720	but you need to squeeze them to get the air out.
506720	514720	So yeah, I brought a lot of tools to try and get rid of the freaking feet.
514720	517720	I also got the frog thing.
517720	519720	It goes like...
519720	533720	Yeah, it's into the frog.
533720	536720	I ain't working that one, hold on.
536720	538720	Okay, I'll try and say more names.
538720	540720	I'm so sorry.
540720	544720	I'm very flustered when it comes to these kinds of streams.
544720	548720	I feel a little pressured, like...
549720	551720	How are you so good with your feet?
551720	556720	I don't know, how are you not so good with your feet?
556720	562720	I'm trying not to knock over the webcam.
562720	564720	We'll do this.
564720	566720	We'll try and say some names, okay?
566720	569720	Although next, plastic goes,
569720	572720	ceruto, cookie, fungler, kids and gamer.
572720	577720	I've reluctantly said sakura and koku,
577720	585720	dimsidown, national panda,
585720	591720	dragon karma, toasty reef oracle, rikos,
591720	596720	voltage isaya, domino miku.
596720	599720	Okay, that was what was done offline.
599720	603720	Now what was done right now is freaking impossible to keep up with,
603720	606720	but I'm going to try my best, doesn't mean I can't try.
606720	608720	Okay, I'm going to try and keep up.
608720	610720	Please bear with me.
610720	612720	AC's in the room, bear with me.
612720	613720	Okay.
613720	615720	Could you wet...
615720	616720	Huh?
616720	618720	Could you...
618720	620720	Man, I wish I had a little feet.
620720	623720	Could you wet feet drying my...
623720	627720	Well, I bought pop rocks to see if I can actually get them to pop with my feet sweat alone,
627720	630720	which is pretty gross, but I thought it was really funny.
630720	635720	Right, let me check where the new names come in.
635720	646720	I think Zang, PV Mendes, Gaming Kitsune, Zarian, Outplayboy, Zero Bridge,
646720	651720	wait, Firemaker, Pio Giusefina, we have seen...
651720	654720	I recognize some of these names, hold on, I've already said them.
654720	659720	Larry Twenty, Dejan Parma.
659720	661720	Wait, I said these names.
661720	663720	Oh no, I don't know where it starts.
663720	667720	Viral, San Brulee, I said that too.
667720	669720	Draw?
669720	672720	You know what I'm saying?
672720	675720	Everyone get in the name right twice or like, yeah, that's right, forget,
675720	677720	you better forget my name, yeah.
677720	679720	I'm repeating sorry, I'm so sorry.
679720	681720	Right, I think we're here.
681720	686720	Ghizalina, I said Jacob Otskou.
686720	692720	Sleepy Fennec, Eye Flora, Super Grung,
692720	695720	not Alessandro Tenspene,
695720	699720	I don't know, I recognize I've already said these names.
699720	703720	Oh my god, George, it's so hard for me.
703720	707720	Are you getting ASMR at least?
707720	710720	Congrats on monetization, thank you so much, I'm so sorry,
710720	713720	I'm like really out of my element with these kind of streams.
713720	715720	I'm not used to it.
715720	718720	I don't know, I'm just used to it.
718720	722720	Hopefully I can at least do some actual ASMR in a moment.
722720	725720	I'm so sorry, I'm trying to catch up for a little.
725720	731720	Tachio, Carbonai, I had nothing.
731720	734720	Scarecrow, damn, okay, I don't recognize saying these.
734720	738720	Blackwing, 757, why did that just change?
738720	743720	Brayoko, I'm a heron.
743720	747720	I'm a heron, size...
747720	750720	Oh sorry, maybe your other ear should get something else.

762720	767720	Busbun, Yummy, Ellie Ball, Jackie's,
767720	772720	Garaki, and Gentlemere,
772720	775720	and Scrumptious Nightmare, we did it, we did it.
775720	777720	I freaking caught up, I don't know how we did it.
777720	781720	Thank you so much for everyone who is becoming a member
781720	783720	and being so fantastic.
783720	786720	I'm completely out of my element, I do apologize,
786720	789720	but yeah, you like that?
790720	793720	But thank you so much for your support, you did it!
793720	795720	Can you please scare him like that?
795720	797720	I was gonna do a fake cam on Buckshot, really.
797720	800720	I don't know if I have to go to a doctor about my toe
800720	802720	because something is wrong with it,
802720	804720	and I don't know what on Earth is going on.
804720	809720	Oh she did, so on this toe, this bit here,
809720	812720	she cut into like really deep,
812720	815720	and I was like, oh no, it's fine, like accidents happen.
815720	818720	It was a little bit painful, but I didn't think anything of it.
818720	821720	And then it's actually pretty sore today,
821720	823720	so I don't know if I have to get a check though.
823720	825720	But yeah.
825720	827720	The only good thing with your toe is it's not,
827720	830720	the only thing wrong with your toe is it's not my max!
830720	833720	Oh my goodness, okay, you're done.
836720	838720	Scrumptious Nightmare, thank you.
838720	840720	Frosty Dino, thank you.
840720	843720	Grampo, thank you for becoming a man, sir.
843720	844720	Yeah, it's good, I do.
844720	846720	You're not supposed to cut it at all,
846720	849720	a lot of shops do it anyway, yeah.
849720	852720	I think I may have got hurt a little bit, but it's okay.
852720	855720	Turi, thank you.
855720	857720	I appreciate it.
858720	860720	Right, well let's see if we can open up Pop Rocks
860720	862720	with their feet and get my feet swept
862720	864720	to activate the Pop Rocks.
864720	866720	This might be very loud actually, hold on.
866720	869720	I'm going to take it a little bit away from you, okay?
869720	873720	I don't know if I can do it with my feet till it's open.
873720	876720	Anything is possible if you get your hands on it.
876720	878720	So we have the...
882720	886720	Grupper Repair Funds for 10, thank you so much.
886720	887720	Oh wait, wasn't there a red?
887720	888720	Why is it not displaying?
888720	891720	I could have sworn us all red earlier.
891720	893720	It was a red.
893720	896720	The Jingle of 100 in Celebration and Monetization
896720	898720	are giving my first ever red symbol.
898720	901720	Thank you, my goodness.
901720	903720	Thank you so much.
903720	905720	Do you guys think you better support the girls
905720	907720	more than this, I can't say.
910720	912720	Oh my God, I don't think I can rip it open.
912720	914720	Hold on.
914720	916720	Actually having to use my green power.
916720	918720	Monkey Feet Goop.
918720	923720	I can't see if there's like a green rip section on it.
923720	925720	I can't see anything at all.
925720	928720	That's why I've not turned my glasses.
928720	931720	Okay, I'm trying to rip it open, but it's gonna work.
933720	935720	Support the girls and the mama.
937720	939720	You got my neurons.
939720	941720	Congrats on the Monetization.
941720	943720	Thank you.
943720	945720	It really wasn't that hard in the nicest...
946720	948720	Streams, Assets, Creed, Brotherhood and Nerds
948720	949720	are about it.
949720	950720	Oh yeah, no thank you.
950720	952720	I've worked really hard for that.
952720	954720	Diddy, thank you for becoming a member.
954720	956720	Oh my God.
957720	958720	Hi Rain.
958720	960720	I am so sorry Rain, please don't look.
960720	962720	It's not what it looks like Rain.
962720	964720	It's a mistake, okay?
964720	966720	Hi Rain.
966720	968720	It really didn't mean anything.
968720	969720	Thank you for the 10.
969720	971720	Did you want to put down a pillow first or last?
971720	974720	Nah, it's fine.
974720	979720	The place I am renting the caskets
979720	982720	weren't even cleaned before I moved in,
982720	985720	so you get what you want back.
985720	986720	Thanks.
988720	990720	Thank you.
990720	993720	I'll let...
993720	995720	999, thank you for becoming a member.
995720	997720	Okay, I don't think I'm gonna have to choose my hand.
997720	999720	Sorry lads, hold on.
999720	1001720	Oh wait, I'll do it off camera.
1001720	1002720	Watch this.
1002720	1003720	Oh look at my toes go.
1003720	1004720	Oh sorry.
1004720	1006720	Oh sorry, my toes weren't in frame.
1006720	1007720	Oh dear.
1007720	1008720	Oh my toes weren't in frame.
1008720	1010720	Oh you couldn't see that.
1010720	1011720	Oh dear.
1011720	1013720	But I did get them open.
1013720	1016720	So, the way my feet sweat the most is in this section
1016720	1018720	in between the toes,
1018720	1021720	so this is what I'm basically gonna aim for.
1021720	1022720	This is disgusting.
1022720	1025720	If this actually pops, this is awful.
1025720	1028720	If this genuinely pops because of my feet sweating,
1028720	1030720	this is terrible.
1030720	1034720	Okay, if the Spidey, thank you for becoming a member,
1034720	1037720	if this pops, I'm actually gonna cry.
1037720	1040720	I hope so it doesn't, but I'm at the same time anyway.
1040720	1042720	Hold on.
1042720	1044720	I need to sit on the floor for this.
1044720	1047720	Ooh, I need to do this with my foot.
1047720	1049720	As if this pops.
1052720	1054720	I can't hold them in my toes.
1057720	1058720	Did it pop?
1058720	1059720	No, I thought I could do it.
1059720	1060720	I think we're safe.
1060720	1062720	I think we're safe.
1062720	1064720	I can't do it.
1064720	1065720	Wait, did it pop?
1065720	1066720	No.
1066720	1068720	Oh, hold on.
1068720	1070720	I hear it, shut up.
1073720	1074720	Did it pop?
1074720	1075720	It's popping.
1075720	1078720	No, that's so gross.
1078720	1080720	I'm gonna sweat my feet this way.
1080720	1081720	Hold on.
1093720	1094720	It popped.
1094720	1097720	So now you're on the line about that.
1097720	1099720	That's disgusting.
1099720	1101720	But yeah, I got really sweaty feet.
1101720	1104720	I also have sweaty hands, maybe I would do it with my hand.
1107720	1109720	It's kind of the same thing where it's sweaty
1109720	1111720	in between my fingers more.
1115720	1116720	Salted feet.
1116720	1118720	Why, you wanna lick them?
1118720	1119720	Oh, wait.
1119720	1121720	Oh no, it's getting sticky,
1121720	1122720	because my feet are over.
1122720	1125720	I never thought this far ahead.
1125720	1127720	Why am I so low IQ?
1127720	1129720	It's such a curse sometimes.
1129720	1130720	Hold on.
1133720	1136720	Thank you Esteban Lomiel,
1136720	1138720	who I'm gonna remember.
1138720	1141720	Thank you Colin.
1141720	1143720	Four, three, one, six.
1143720	1147720	And thank you Shalom Plain.
1148720	1150720	She kinda dumb though.
1150720	1152720	Sticky feet mean sticky floors.
1153720	1154720	Oof.
1154720	1156720	You put socks on after this stream.
1156720	1159720	Oh, there's like bits and spots everywhere now.
1159720	1160720	You know what?
1160720	1162720	Maybe that reefling was right,
1162720	1164720	and I should have put a towel down.
1164720	1166720	Hold on, my sweaty hands are so sticky.
1166720	1169720	They're sticking to my hands.
1169720	1171720	Look, it's actually a benefit.
1171720	1173720	It's actually a benefit, okay?
1173720	1176720	You just have to think of the situation.
1177720	1178720	Hold on.
1178720	1180720	Let me just pop them up there.
1180720	1182720	Our experiment has been conducted.
1183720	1186720	Gross, I don't know.
1186720	1188720	My ears have a pop rock sometimes.
1188720	1189720	I'm trying to help.
1189720	1191720	Actual squid behaviors.
1191720	1193720	Honestly.
1195720	1198720	This is welcome to the reefling membership tier,
1198720	1200720	and this is message redacted.
1200720	1202720	I don't know how, but here you go.
1205720	1208720	Thank you Brayoko
1208720	1211720	for the super chat.
1212720	1215720	Oh my god, the super chat, because I'm monetized.
1215720	1217720	Found your credit card.
1217720	1218720	Congrats!
1218720	1220720	Maybe don't...
1220720	1222720	You don't have to support, by the way.
1222720	1224720	I always have free membership streams all the time.
1226720	1228720	Today we learned to always put damage up.
1228720	1230720	Right, and we're going to actually do ASMR
1230720	1232720	at the same time to hold up.
1233720	1235720	This is your boy.
1236720	1238720	This is ridiculous.
1238720	1240720	My offer counts.
1241720	1244720	Bull, I also got my Skyrim achievements to work.
1244720	1246720	I have like 12% Skyrim achievements.
1246720	1248720	I don't know why they weren't displayed,
1248720	1250720	but we might be able to actually go back
1250720	1252720	to the Skyrim stream at any time.
1252720	1254720	Bull, I thank you for becoming the streamers.
1254720	1256720	Totally bonkers.
1256720	1258720	Congrats, new membership. Thank you.
1258720	1260720	Thank you, boy, for being a member.
1260720	1263720	Thank you, uh, Sithmans for coming to member as well.
1264720	1265720	Yeah.
1265720	1267720	Oh, you're getting tangled up in Wazir right now.
1267720	1268720	Shhh.
1271720	1273720	Next week, yeah.
1274720	1276720	Our Endurance stream of the week is...
1278720	1280720	Hold on, let me put these on, yeah.
1281720	1284720	Thank you, uh, Shiori
1284720	1286720	for becoming a member.
1286720	1289720	And thank you, Dr. P, for becoming a member.
1289720	1293720	Hold on, this is going to take some manipulation
1293720	1296720	because this ear isn't sitting
1296720	1298720	the way ears actually sit.
1305720	1307720	Oh, wow, my feet are so talented.
1315720	1317720	You look on Skyrim achievements
1317720	1320720	and usually take, like, three streams
1320720	1321720	unless your stream's super long.
1321720	1322720	Yeah.
1322720	1324720	I'm a bit of an Endurance streamer, okay?
1325720	1326720	Shhh.
1326720	1327720	ASMR.
1328720	1331720	Thank you, Jay, for the membership.
1331720	1332720	Thank you.
1332720	1335720	Oh, woo-ee, for the membership.
1338720	1340720	Oh, no, they're coming off.
1340720	1341720	Shhh.
1341720	1342720	Say, just say.
1343720	1344720	Shhh.
1345720	1347720	Well, those feet grew arms and hands out of nowhere.
1347720	1348720	How about your next skill?
1348720	1350720	Look, I'm going to say for the pod.
1350720	1352720	I have eight arms, okay?
1353720	1355720	How do you buy membership?
1355720	1356720	Oh, you don't have to.
1356720	1357720	There should be a join button,
1357720	1358720	but it doesn't work everywhere,
1358720	1359720	so don't worry if you can't buy.
1359720	1361720	I always have free streams coming out
1361720	1366720	and the membership streams start next week.
1366720	1368720	Not this week,
1368720	1370720	because by the end of this week
1370720	1373720	I'll have everything in place
1373720	1375720	work-wise so I only have to do shorts.
1375720	1377720	And I'm very glad.
1377720	1379720	I am so glad that all the responsibility
1379720	1381720	is taken off me.
1381720	1384720	And I'm just a normal stromer.
1384720	1386720	We should have changed all our names
1386720	1389720	into Jamal for the stream,
1389720	1391720	knowing beforehand you would have said
1391720	1392720	every person.
1392720	1395720	We should have one reflame.
1395720	1397720	It's all arms anyway.
1397720	1398720	The logic checks out
1398720	1401720	and definitely isn't influenced by the membership.
1402720	1404720	And the join button is sometimes
1404720	1406720	not next to subscription on mobile.
1406720	1408720	Yeah, I guess if you're in the phone.
1408720	1409720	But don't worry,
1409720	1410720	you don't have to directly support me.
1410720	1412720	I'll always have free streams coming out
1412720	1414720	like all the time.
1414720	1416720	I'm not kidding.
1416720	1420720	You can't take me off.
1420720	1421720	Come on.
1421720	1422720	You can't.
1422720	1423720	It's not possible.
1423720	1424720	Okay?
1424720	1426720	So don't try and take me off.
1427720	1428720	Bless the shimi.
1428720	1429720	Thank you very much.
1429720	1430720	Remember?
1433720	1437720	Are you doing me with my dog?
1437720	1439720	Are you doing hypnosis soon?
1440720	1441720	Not right now.
1441720	1442720	No.
1442720	1443720	No of these.
1443720	1445720	I don't think anyone can get hypnotized
1445720	1446720	by fricking toes.
1446720	1448720	You can see how opaque my skin is.
1448720	1450720	You can see my blue veins.
1450720	1452720	Check them veins out.
1452720	1453720	You can literally see them.
1453720	1454720	I have my little tendons.
1454720	1456720	If you look hard enough for them.
1456720	1457720	Oh, there they are.
1457720	1459720	Look at them tendons.
1465720	1467720	Thank you for the tip.
1467720	1469720	I'll hold on a string on the swing.
1469720	1471720	Did Brian talk?
1471720	1473720	Did Brian say anything?
1473720	1475720	I hope not.
1477720	1479720	Oh, it's kind of working.
1479720	1480720	Okay.
1480720	1482720	Stream element says no.
1482720	1483720	Kind of working.
1483720	1485720	Mika's big fan.
1485720	1488720	Thank you for the five gifted memberships.
1488720	1490720	And then Boyce the Trigger
1490720	1494720	wore just purple burglar alarm honestly.
1494720	1496720	Brian said it but he was quiet.
1496720	1497720	Good.
1497720	1499720	I'm glad he didn't say it.
1499720	1501720	I did not say no.
1506720	1508720	Bejinga.
1508720	1511720	In celebration, I gave my first ever ritz.
1511720	1513720	Yes, I did.
1513720	1515720	I'm so sorry.
1515720	1518720	I'm very scared of brain right now.
1518720	1521720	Secret, thank you for becoming a member.
1521720	1523720	This is the craziest ASMR concept.
1523720	1525720	It's not even ASMR, let's be honest.
1525720	1526720	I'm just dumb.
1526720	1528720	I'm just dumb for you.
1528720	1530720	I'm from a field.
1530720	1532720	Thank you.
1532720	1534720	Thank you.
1537720	1539720	What?
1539720	1541720	At their name?
1541720	1542720	At their...
1542720	1546720	Strony, I just want to stream what I want and enjoy.
1546720	1547720	Corporals, you can't do that.
1547720	1548720	You'll never be successful.
1548720	1550720	Strony, who my beer makes whole companies
1550720	1552720	have life-mangered people to stream with.
1552720	1556720	I cannot tell you how unbelievably nice it is.
1556720	1558720	Thank you for that type of thing.
1558720	1561720	I cannot tell you how unbelievably nice it is
1561720	1563720	to have like-minded individuals,
1563720	1565720	knowing gays are rats.
1565720	1568720	I jumped on my alternative Twitter
1568720	1570720	and was listening to the feed.
1570720	1573720	I'm just sitting listening to A.C. Tinkle
1573720	1576720	and I'm just like, yeah, this is actually quite good quality.
1576720	1579720	Honestly, I wouldn't mind if she brought a 3D one there.
1579720	1582720	It is so nice to have like-minded individuals
1582720	1585720	that are like, yeah, let's provide the goods.
1585720	1588720	We say no to blue-balling here, okay?
1588720	1590720	You ask and you receive, okay?
1590720	1593720	You ask other agencies, you get donor-walled.
1595720	1597720	Hold on, I'm going to take a drink of water.
1597720	1598720	I'm going to put dehydrate.
1598720	1600720	Please take a drink of it now.
1600720	1612720	P.L.U.R. allegations are yet to be resolved.
1612720	1615720	I will make a public statement about the P.L.U.R. allegations.
1615720	1619720	As you can see, we're in very hot water about the P.L.U.R. allegations.
1619720	1622720	What is donor-walled?
1622720	1627720	Donor-walled is when someone gives a streamer a lot of money
1627720	1631720	via a donation and the streamer doesn't read it out loud
1631720	1633720	for whatever reason it may be.
1633720	1634720	They genuinely missed it.
1634720	1635720	That's very plausible.
1635720	1637720	They don't want to acknowledge it
1637720	1639720	because of maybe the contents,
1639720	1641720	but donor-walled is the term
1641720	1645720	when someone gives over money and still gets the money.
1645720	1647720	That's beyond.
1647720	1652720	Thank you for becoming a member.
1652720	1656720	Good luck with the P.L.U.R. campaign.
1656720	1665720	Mi-Win-Jin 2 comes out of the P.L.U.R. campaign.
1665720	1671720	P.L.U.R. is the best station in the world.
1671720	1674720	Okay, I genuinely think I managed to catch up to everyone.
1674720	1677720	Thank you so much for all of the love and support.
1677720	1679720	I'm really overwhelmed right now
1679720	1681720	and I feel so out of my element.
1681720	1684720	I'm like, oh my god, what do I do?
1685720	1689720	I figured out what I do to P.L.U.R.
1689720	1694720	Right, so you may notice that my tier 2 is $4.99.
1694720	1698720	I don't think it can be gifted unless on purpose, right?
1698720	1702720	Like, can you not just manually put in gift $1.99?
1702720	1706720	Internet-baz of fees.
1706720	1708720	Thank you for the member.
1708720	1710720	Hold on, I'm trying so hard to do this.
1710720	1714720	The P.L.U.R. needs to rehire a P.L.U.R. position.
1714720	1715720	A P.L.U.R. position.
1715720	1717720	Oh, jeez.
1721720	1723720	This is embarrassing, I can't grip it.
1723720	1724720	Oh, there we go.
1724720	1725720	Surprise, surprise.
1725720	1727720	If you use two feet, you can grip it really well.
1729720	1731720	Jeremy, thank you for coming to member.
1731720	1735720	I'm so sorry to end when I'm alienating right now in this room.
1735720	1737720	Literally, this is getting...
1737720	1738720	Come on, please.
1740720	1741720	Okay, here we go.
1741720	1742720	We'll do it like this.
1745720	1746720	Wow, Asterix.
1746720	1749720	Thank you for the five gifted members.
1749720	1751720	Did it do a moose?
1751720	1753720	You guys have a moose now.
1754720	1757720	Jake, Jake said pre-looked grippers.
1757720	1759720	Let's go, honestly.
1760720	1761720	Okay, just that.
1762720	1764720	I'm gonna put it like that.
1765720	1766720	Oh, there we go.
1766720	1767720	We got it.
1769720	1770720	Oh my god, we got it.
1772720	1773720	The Dexterix.
1774720	1775720	Just admit it.
1776720	1777720	Just admit it.
1777720	1780720	No other streamer is even capable of doing this physically,
1780720	1782720	because they wouldn't be able to do it.
1786720	1788720	This is absolutely staggering.
1788720	1790720	Did anyone take a...
1790720	1793720	Or is everyone just blown away by this
1793720	1795720	even being a streamer concept?
1796720	1798720	Do you know how long I planned this for?
1798720	1800720	I planned this for...
1801720	1803720	I planned this
1804720	1806720	back when I was concepted
1806720	1808720	to have French tits and nails,
1808720	1810720	which is absolutely awful.
1810720	1812720	I've been waiting months on this idea
1813720	1815720	to utilize it.
1815720	1816720	Man is up one.
1816720	1817720	Thank you for...
1820720	1822720	Right, can I do two at once?
1823720	1824720	I think I can.
1826720	1827720	Hold them by the bottom.
1828720	1829720	Oh, this is...
1831720	1832720	Hold on.
1833720	1834720	We're losing them.
1835720	1837720	My feet are so sweaty that they're...
1837720	1838720	Right, they're up,
1838720	1839720	and then...
1839720	1841720	Oh, they're up a bit too much.
1844720	1845720	I can do this chat.
1845720	1846720	Let me do it.
1849720	1850720	Does that even work?
1851720	1853720	Oh, my ankle just cracked.
1853720	1854720	Did you hear that?
1854720	1856720	Literally jewel-wielding the tingles right now.
1858720	1861720	We're in uncharted territory.
1862720	1865720	I'll forget to say, why can I not do it with that one?
1865720	1869720	I wonder if the plaster is actually helping me grip this one.
1872720	1874720	I'm jewel-wielding tingles.
1874720	1875720	Why?
1875720	1877720	I think my feet are actually getting too sweaty
1877720	1879720	to pick this up because it's glass.
1881720	1883720	I think I'm gonna have to take off.
1883720	1884720	Right.
1885720	1887720	I think I'm literally...
1887720	1889720	Hold on, we'll just go the brush.
1889720	1891720	Calm, calm.
1893720	1895720	The migraine, thank you for becoming a member.
1895720	1897720	I appreciate it.
1898720	1901720	If this isn't peak streaming, I don't know what is.
1901720	1903720	Honestly, like, which year...
1904720	1905720	Which year's...
1905720	1906720	Where the heck is my other...
1906720	1907720	Oh, here.
1908720	1909720	Hold on, I'm cheating.
1909720	1910720	Just a little bit.
1912720	1914720	Jewel-wield brushes.
1914720	1915720	Come on.
1915720	1917720	Come on, admit it.
1917720	1919720	It's just so hard to do because of the ankle.
1920720	1921720	Oh, there we go.
1921720	1924720	I just need to relax the gripper.
1926720	1927720	ASMR.
1929720	1930720	I'm impressed.
1931720	1933720	Did you watch the new Echo Showcase?
1933720	1935720	Apparently Fable 4 is coming out.
1935720	1936720	Wait, hold on a second.
1936720	1938720	I'm gonna just grip it sideways.
1939720	1940720	Ta-da.
1940720	1942720	We love joe feet wielding tingles.
1942720	1943720	I bet you do.
1944720	1946720	Wah, thank you for becoming a member.
1946720	1947720	Yay, Fable.
1947720	1949720	But they were saying...
1949720	1951720	And apparently the new Dragon Age Origins
1951720	1954720	has, like, a ton of little G-fans really mad
1954720	1955720	because there's something wrong with that.
1955720	1956720	Like, how do you fix them then?
1957720	1959720	Oh, and my feet are actually too...
1959720	1960720	Getting too sweaty.
1960720	1961720	Correct the shit.
1961720	1962720	Hold on.
1963720	1964720	I need my pinkie.
1964720	1966720	I need my pinkie to join in on the grip.
1966720	1968720	I need my gripper.
1974720	1977720	She's put maxing on food?
1977720	1978720	I am.
1982720	1985720	From a two-handed build in Skyrim to a joe wield build
1985720	1987720	the next day, so talented.
1987720	1988720	I know.
1988720	1989720	I know.
1989720	1991720	Isn't it amazing?
1991720	1994720	God, look at the gel shine on that big toe.
1994720	1996720	Oh, look at that shine.
1996720	1998720	Oh, that's gorgeous.
1998720	2000720	I admire my own feet.
2000720	2001720	Yes, I do.
2001720	2002720	And such cool.
2002720	2005720	Rosso, thank you for becoming a member.
2005720	2007720	Omen.
2007720	2010720	So then thank you for becoming a member.
2012720	2014720	Oh, my ring light there.
2014720	2018720	That's what's lighting up the deck under here
2018720	2020720	because it's all dark.
2020720	2023720	So that's what the gel polish is doing.
2024720	2026720	Delicious brown waifu.
2026720	2029720	Thank you for becoming a member.
2032720	2035720	Not 3DO, it should have been me.
2037720	2040720	Hammerfell is going to come in 2026 if we're lucky.
2040720	2044720	I'll be so interested to see if I'll enjoy the game or not.
2044720	2048720	It might be one of those games where I have to play offline for the first time
2048720	2050720	to even appreciate it.
2050720	2055720	I don't know if you ever, like, you know, your first play through of a game,
2055720	2057720	you're so silent and so quiet
2057720	2060720	because you're just experiencing it for the first time.
2060720	2062720	So I feel like it would be hard to commentate.
2062720	2064720	Like, I really want to play Big Bobby's Gate,
2064720	2066720	but I'm worried I won't have a thought,
2066720	2069720	like a single thought formed because I've never played it before.
2072720	2076720	I'm sad I can't hear, but the visuals, the visuals, though.
2076720	2078720	Yeah, you like the visuals.
2078720	2080720	Can I do the middle finger on a toe?
2080720	2081720	Hold on.
2081720	2082720	Can I?
2082720	2084720	No, I'll just put this down.
2084720	2087720	And then bring you back up again.
2087720	2089720	And then everyone go down.
2089720	2090720	Oh, no, it's not going to work.
2090720	2091720	I don't have that kind of...
2091720	2093720	I don't have that kind of toe deck, though.
2093720	2095720	You have the kind where I can, like, grip around and stuff.
2097720	2099720	My appendages.
2099720	2100720	My appendages.
2100720	2102720	I'm actually tempted to leave these on
2102720	2105720	because it's helping to muffle me making any mistakes.
2106720	2107720	Crying.
2108720	2109720	Shimmer pants.
2111720	2112720	Thank you for the time.
2112720	2114720	Congrats on monetization, Stony.
2114720	2115720	Thank you!
2115720	2117720	Like, we had a direct support.
2117720	2121720	A fan made more remaster of oblivion made in Scourge Engine
2121720	2123720	is coming out to it with us.
2123720	2124720	Cue.
2125720	2127720	I do a little tapping these more.
2127720	2131720	It feels like I don't have the dexterity to do the frog thing.
2131720	2135720	If Wolves and Gromit aren't becoming cranes of beyond on our fellow...
2135720	2138720	Oh, does a Wolves and Gromit thing come out?
2138720	2140720	How far can your tanky pool?
2140720	2141720	What do you mean, far?
2141720	2143720	I can only go like this.
2148720	2149720	Sky Blivion.
2151720	2152720	Get Nordid.
2152720	2153720	Get Nordid.
2153720	2154720	Get Nordid.
2155720	2156720	Hmm.
2156720	2160720	It's commonly referred to as Sky Blivion by the project workers.
2160720	2161720	Aren't they not...
2161720	2164720	Wouldn't they not get a season to say that they're doing that?
2166720	2167720	What's going on?
2169720	2170720	Cup your ears.
2170720	2172720	I'm cupping your ears.
2174720	2177720	There's also a mod project that makes all of Nen...
2178720	2179720	Nen?
2179720	2183720	I would love if the Morrowind remake would come out, but we will hope.
2184720	2185720	Cheese, Gromit.
2185720	2188720	I'm sure there's a new Wolves and Gromit thing coming out.
2188720	2190720	I don't know if it's a movie or what.
2190720	2194720	Because everyone was like, oh, a new Wolves and Gromit before GTA 6.
2195720	2197720	No, because it's fantastic.
2197720	2198720	Fanmade mods are free.
2198720	2201720	Ah, that's how they got away with it.
2202720	2206720	But this, it doesn't actually get up a day about mods and assets they pack.
2207720	2209720	Fallout 3 and New Vegas are fine.
2209720	2214720	What were the accusations that Fallout 4 got the most useless update recently?
2214720	2218720	And it was to spite modders to break them all or something?
2218720	2221720	Was that Fallout 4 or did I make that up?
2223720	2228720	The amount of complete reworks on this current engine is crazy.
2231720	2233720	Danny Elorma make volume, by the way.
2233720	2235720	It keeps peaking red.
2236720	2237720	But...
2240720	2245720	Yeah, they had more than they would hope their studio got burned or other stuff and more.
2247720	2250720	I'm playing Fallout 4 right now.
2254720	2259720	The update Fallout 4 due to the show, and it broke all the mods and the mods.
2259720	2261720	Oh, okay, that makes more sense.
2262720	2263720	That makes it feel good.
2263720	2269720	Okay, it keeps peaking red and I'm like, am I, am I, am I grippers to OP for this microphone right now?
2274720	2275720	Wow.
2275720	2276720	Hmm.
2277720	2280720	Peter, Salis, whose voice grew on it passed away.
2280720	2281720	Oh.
2282720	2284720	I guess I don't have to get a fan, do I?
2288720	2289720	That sounds good.
2289720	2290720	I'm glad.
2290720	2293720	I thought right, my ears are fine, my ears are fine.
2293720	2294720	Good.
2295720	2298720	Just so you know, for the replays, this isn't an endurance stream.
2299720	2304720	I'm very out of my element with the webcam on and I'm like...
2305720	2307720	Okay, now what?
2308720	2309720	I'm like, okay.
2310720	2313720	But thank you so, so much to everyone who's membering.
2313720	2317720	Thank you so, so much to everyone who's super-chan or tiffin or anything.
2317720	2319720	It's such a fantastic help.
2320720	2329720	Like, obviously I don't want to say too much, but, you know, it takes a year to create a new generation, so this is very reassuring.
2330720	2335720	If there may or may not be some plans in the background, ho, ho, ho.
2336720	2338720	We love mommy, love you, Eastling.
2338720	2339720	Thank you, seriously.
2339720	2341720	Like, I'm a bit overwhelmed.
2341720	2345720	Like, I literally have my hands like this because I'm like, oh, okay.
2346720	2347720	I was nervous.
2347720	2348720	Like, I don't know what to do.
2348720	2350720	I was nervous to sleep.
2350720	2351720	Genius idea, please.
2351720	2359720	I was going to do a photo-cam stream on Buckshot Relay and then you guys can tell me to put my feet back on the floor because I always sit on them.
2365720	2366720	Absolutely.
2366720	2368720	There were the scores last, literally.
2369720	2370720	Thank you.
2370720	2372720	Yes, I just filled out my element.
2372720	2374720	I'm like, I'm used to meme-ing.
2374720	2378720	I'm used to, well, I guess the stream is a big meme, to be honest.
2378720	2383720	I don't need to put that much, like, what's the word, that much.
2383720	2392720	I did bring, I know everyone is tired of Japanese youth cleaning tools, and it gets done today, but it's true.
2393720	2398720	Thank you, Tiko Suwabi, for becoming a member.
2398720	2400720	I can't pick this up, hold on.
2400720	2404720	Thank you, Berenice Yuzette, for becoming a member.
2404720	2408720	And thank you, Eleka Riaz.
2410720	2412720	Wow, sorry I'm late.
2412720	2413720	No need to be sorry at all.
2413720	2414720	Thank you for becoming a member.
2414720	2416720	Forgiveness sake.
2416720	2420720	When it's really thin, it's so hard to grip.
2420720	2421720	Seriously.
2421720	2423720	This is, like, outrageously thin, right?
2423720	2426720	I'm not going to need to, like, bring it closer.
2426720	2430720	And then, I need to take this off gently, if I can even do that.
2430720	2434720	That's right, you're cleaning via foot, or whatever.
2436720	2441720	Ah, Internet, Bazoo, File, Mealtalk, it's cool to see you willing to be able to,
2441720	2444720	it's a challenge, even with a handful of people, much less.
2444720	2449720	300, eh, 300, that's like 600, throwing money, literally.
2449720	2455720	I'm definitely not a handcam streamer, I don't think I, I don't, don't expect any footcam, handcam.
2456720	2459720	After this, I'm going to be honest, I'm like, oh, it's not for me.
2459720	2462720	Right, we're going to do this as gently as possible, okay?
2463720	2464720	Gentle.
2466720	2471720	Thank you for coming to my ear cleaning foot spa experience.
2474720	2477720	I ran through, thank you for becoming a member.
2477720	2484720	Now just let the brush slowly glide across your ear.
2486720	2490720	And as the brush cleans the outer ear, hold on.
2491720	2495720	You will find yourself, hold on, and relax.
2502720	2504720	Just like this.
2505720	2509720	Instructional ASMR, just let me ASMR you.
2510720	2512720	Oh yeah, that's right, that's the money shot.
2512720	2517720	That's so hard to, to, I'm tripping, my poor pinky.
2517720	2519720	Look how hard my pinky is trying right now.
2519720	2523720	My pinky is like going to France without hard as trying.
2530720	2532720	You can't be feetlings anymore.
2532720	2534720	After the stream, I don't think you're feetlings.
2534720	2539720	I think I'll stick to the VTuber model because I'm like so nervous with the webcam on.
2540720	2542720	Plastic girl, thank you for the 10.
2542720	2547720	If you like feet though, Emmy's doing foot cam stream later this week, okay?
2547720	2550720	Emmy Bezu, her link is in the description.
2550720	2555720	Subscribe and hit the bell if you are into feet because she's, oh, I just dropped it.
2555720	2557720	I don't even notice I dropped it, hold on.
2561720	2563720	Right, and then pass it to this one.
2563720	2566720	This is my strong foot, take my strong foot.
2566720	2568720	Refling, take my strong foot.
2570720	2573720	Refling, no, don't fall, grab onto my foot.
2573720	2575720	Grab onto my French pedicure foot.
2576720	2578720	French pedicure pedicure.
2578720	2579720	Thank you.
2579720	2582720	Ruin desolations, as I remember.
2582720	2584720	Thank you, jargon hearts, for becoming a member.
2585720	2587720	This is literally my left foot.
2587720	2590720	Unless, unless I hold it like a pencil.
2591720	2593720	Hold on, I need to like dab it against myself.
2594720	2601720	Just know whenever you hear ear cleaning in my ASMR role plays, it's not done by my hands.
2601720	2603720	It's done by my foot.
2603720	2605720	Foot holding him.
2606720	2609720	Thank you everyone for memberships and supporting me.
2609720	2611720	I appreciate it.
2611720	2621720	We are testing if tier two needs to be higher than 4.99 US dollars.
2621720	2624720	But I don't think it has to be.
2624720	2626720	Not from what I've seen.
2629720	2632720	Oh no, it's dropped again, jeez.
2633720	2635720	This is really difficult.
2635720	2637720	I thought I had a bit more.
2637720	2639720	I think because it's so thin.
2640720	2641720	Okay, there we go.
2641720	2642720	This is easy.
2644720	2646720	It's gone again, jeez.
2646720	2648720	I'm going to have to joe wield this.
2649720	2652720	Double the twos, honestly.
2652720	2655720	B, yaku.
2655720	2656720	G, yaku.
2656720	2657720	Thank you for the membership.
2657720	2658720	I appreciate it.
2658720	2659720	Right, we're swapping.
2659720	2660720	We're swapping.
2660720	2661720	I can't do this anymore.
2661720	2663720	Okay, let's do the bubbles.
2663720	2665720	I said let's do the bubbles.
2668720	2672720	This is the most bizarre monetization celebration I've ever seen.
2672720	2674720	I've actually outdone myself.
2674720	2676720	I've actually surprised myself.
2677720	2679720	Weird, this concept.
2679720	2680720	Can the bubbles come?
2684720	2686720	Sorry, that was probably really loud.
2686720	2687720	I'm so sorry.
2688720	2695720	I hope no one's actually consuming this stream at a level of loud ASMR.
2695720	2698720	No, don't listen to the stream at ASMR levels.
2698720	2699720	Don't be silly.
2699720	2701720	My skull, we're faked.
2701720	2704720	Okay, I was going to say don't be silly and listen at ASMR levels.
2704720	2706720	My feet are literally the pilot.
2706720	2710720	You're telling me you trust my feet not to ever make a blip.
2710720	2712720	I know my ear drum's still there.
2712720	2713720	Ow, my ear.
2713720	2714720	Yeah, no.
2714720	2716720	Don't listen at ASMR levels.
2716720	2718720	Don't be silly and listen.
2718720	2720720	It's absolutely no way.
2720720	2728720	Right, so for some reason stream elements can see when you guys gift other people,
2728720	2731720	but it won't register a membership if you bought it yourself.
2731720	2733720	I don't know why.
2734720	2738720	You're kicking into my CPUs ASMR?
2738720	2740720	That's terrible.
2740720	2743720	Fiat, thank you for becoming a member.
2743720	2746720	Is your name Fiat for a particular reason in the stream?
2754720	2755720	That's strange.
2755720	2756720	Yeah, I don't know why.
2756720	2760720	I'm not going to lie to you, your voice overpowers any sound.
2760720	2764720	I could have heard so far would need a different session.
2768720	2772720	Hi, Stony, congrats on unlock and monetization.
2772720	2773720	Thank you.
2775720	2777720	I was thinking you can find yourself.
2777720	2778720	Oh, thank you.
2778720	2780720	Member just for anyone listening.
2780720	2782720	You don't actually have to member, by the way.
2782720	2785720	I always have free content coming up, so please don't worry.
2785720	2789720	Please make sure you look after yourself first such as you pay off your debts
2789720	2794720	because we live in a society and if you're debt free, it's good for you,
2794720	2796720	but bad for society.
2796720	2798720	But we can get into that in another stream.
2798720	2802720	John07, thank you for the membership.
2802720	2803720	I appreciate it.
2803720	2805720	Sorry about all the camera glitching, by the way.
2805720	2810720	This is a very dusty webcam.
2810720	2812720	A very dusty.
2812720	2815720	Nero, thank you for becoming a member.
2815720	2819720	Nero2276, I was supposed to say your phone number.
2819720	2821720	The camera's fine.
2824720	2826720	Peppermint.
2826720	2827720	Did I say that right?
2827720	2828720	Peppermint.
2828720	2830720	There's no R.
2830720	2835720	Okay, ah, you never mind.
2835720	2836720	Okay, never mind.
2836720	2838720	Oh, we got there in the end.
2838720	2842720	Don't worry, Stony, even if we get our ears bumped, you're still the best put stream.
2842720	2844720	Ah, is that my new title now?
2844720	2847720	Like the best put streamer?
2847720	2849720	I would honestly take that title.
2849720	2851720	I'm quite happy with that title.
2856720	2857720	It's all right.
2857720	2860720	My feet are here to comfort you.
2860720	2867720	When it has been a long day, my sweaty grippers are here to pretend to tangle you
2867720	2869720	because let's be honest, this isn't an ASMR stream.
2869720	2872720	No one believes at all this is an ASMR stream.
2872720	2878720	Just because you have the 3D view, it doesn't make it an ASMR stream.
2878720	2886720	Which is why the title's called Monetization Celebration Stream and not ASMR.
2886720	2887720	Watch Mercy's stream.
2887720	2889720	I was wondering if you could do a Q&A too.
2889720	2891720	I would absolutely love to.
2891720	2894720	I would love to do a Q&A.
2894720	2896720	Maybe we can read membership.
2896720	2897720	Membership.
2897720	2898720	Marshmallow.
2898720	2899720	We can read marshmallow.
2899720	2900720	Absolutely.
2900720	2901720	Air Rocks.
2901720	2902720	Starley.
2902720	2903720	Air Rocks.
2903720	2904720	Starley.
2904720	2905720	Yes.
2906720	2910720	We can 100% do a marshmallow reading.
2910720	2912720	That would be fantastic.
2912720	2918720	Although Mercy was purposely saying stuff wrong, which was quite funny.
2918720	2920720	Really giving bad advice.
2920720	2921720	Logan, have a lit.
2921720	2923720	Thank you so much.
2923720	2927720	If you hear my stomach, it's not because I'm hungry and starving.
2927720	2932720	It's because I got a massive loaf of bread and I wouldn't come out before the stream.
2932720	2935720	I went to the toilet three times and I never came out.
2935720	2937720	So I'm sorry if you hear my stomach.
2939720	2942720	This could be really funny for an April Fool's stream.
2942720	2945720	Well, you win the grippers out again.
2945720	2947720	What would the title of the stream be?
2949720	2953720	Too many people ask real questions, but most of Mercy's advice was real, was it?
2953720	2954720	Wait, hold on.
2954720	2956720	Let me get my marshmallow.
2956720	2958720	Because I was a movement.
2958720	2963720	And then I'll go up along.
2963720	2965720	I should only cut ones, yeah?
2967720	2968720	What?
2968720	2971720	You asked me anything.
2971720	2975720	And before I can hardly say anything, that was,
2975720	2978720	wait, where can I pin this?
2979720	2982720	I would like to pin it, but the love heart is in the way.
2982720	2988720	Someone at YouTube, you're telling me not one person at YouTube is aware of this issue?
2988720	2990720	I refuse.
2990720	2992720	Ten message.
2995720	2996720	April Fool's.
2996720	2998720	How is it April Fool's if I've already done it?
2998720	2999720	I've already got you.
2999720	3001720	The gag has been done.
3001720	3004720	You can do my breath on me.
3005720	3006720	Okay.
3006720	3009720	That's my marshmallow thing.
3009720	3012720	And what?
3015720	3018720	No, Tier 2 is what's getting gifted, mummy.
3018720	3021720	You have to raise a price for both ears.
3021720	3022720	Wait, no.
3022720	3025720	I only want emotes to be gifted.
3025720	3028720	I wanted to leave emotes as $1.99.
3028720	3031720	And I have to make it $5 for Tier 2?
3032720	3040720	Honestly, the mental stress of raising it by $0.02 is really good to me.
3040720	3041720	Okay.
3041720	3043720	Be bad in gagging.
3043720	3045720	Thank you for the membership.
3045720	3046720	I appreciate it.
3046720	3047720	We did warn you.
3047720	3050720	I was just wanting them to work so badly.
3052720	3054720	I don't want to raise the price.
3054720	3056720	I have to, apparently if I want to raise the price,
3056720	3059720	I need to close the tier and then open up a new one.
3059720	3061720	I don't even know what happens.
3061720	3065720	It only lets you donate the $4.99 tier.
3067720	3068720	I'm so happy to have you back.
3068720	3069720	I miss you.
3069720	3070720	I miss you too.
3070720	3072720	Oh, that's so annoying.
3077720	3081720	I have to raise the price by a freaking dollar.
3081720	3083720	So, by a dollar, by a cent.
3083720	3087720	So, if I make it, you would leave emotes at $1.99.
3087720	3090720	But Tier 2 has to go up to $5.99.
3093720	3095720	Does it actually have to be?
3097720	3099720	Say it right, sir.
3099720	3100720	I will not go.
3100720	3102720	Turn the lights off.
3102720	3104720	Carry me home.
3105720	3106720	Yeah.
3106720	3109720	It has to go up to $5.99.
3110720	3112720	It's just a dollar, do it.
3112720	3113720	But you don't understand.
3113720	3115720	You don't understand the principle
3115720	3117720	about how much I can gloat and brag
3117720	3120720	that it's only $9.99 to support your Oshi
3120720	3123720	for a month, I feel, or you don't understand.
3128720	3129720	Okay.
3130720	3132720	But it's kind of more of the YouTube channel
3132720	3134720	having to make problems, it's fine.
3135720	3138720	So, right, I guess after this stream,
3139720	3142720	for those of you who sign up now for the Tier 2,
3142720	3145720	I think you only have to pay the $1 difference
3145720	3147720	to get on the tier that is...
3148720	3149720	Oh, that's so annoying.
3149720	3152720	Can I make that new tier live, at least?
3152720	3153720	Or is this like...
3154720	3156720	I don't know how YouTube's going to take this.
3158720	3160720	Oh, I don't know if YouTube's going to like me.
3160720	3161720	Hold on.
3165720	3167720	Levels, edit levels.
3168720	3169720	No!
3170720	3173720	It locked in, the price is locked in.
3173720	3176720	I don't want to put up a dollar, but I have to.
3179720	3180720	Oh, my God.
3180720	3181720	Please, YouTube's not...
3181720	3184720	Right, I have to basically add a new tier...
3186720	3187720	For goodness' sake.
3187720	3191720	Reefling member stream tier.
3192720	3193720	Oh, and...
3194720	3195720	For goodness' sake.
3195720	3197720	You know tier...
3198720	3199720	Oh, okay.
3199720	3201720	Hold on, we're trying to do it together.
3201720	3204720	Right, we need to do it in American Double Laws.
3204720	3206720	United States, set a price...
3207720	3208720	$5.99.
3210720	3211720	$5.99.
3212720	3213720	That's a book in it.
3215720	3217720	Modes, give that man a backshot.
3217720	3218720	What?
3218720	3219720	Wait, what did that happen?
3219720	3222720	We're doing it live, we're doing it live.
3222720	3223720	We're doing it live, we are.
3223720	3224720	Reefling...
3225720	3229720	I'll just put it, Reefling member real tier.
3229720	3232720	Because I'm out of things.
3232720	3234720	And then add a peric...
3236720	3238720	membership stream.
3238720	3240720	Membership only live streams.
3241720	3243720	This is the real deal.
3243720	3244720	Y'all.
3244720	3246720	And then peric instructions, nothing,
3246720	3248720	because you guys don't need to do anything.
3248720	3250720	Then next, what happens?
3250720	3253720	I understand that once my offer's reviews improved,
3253720	3255720	I'm unable to change, to introduce a new price,
3255720	3257720	I can create a new level and or delete any existing.
3257720	3262720	Deleting a level will cancel existing memberships if it happens.
3263720	3265720	Okay, submit for review.
3265720	3271720	Yes, my tier, my freaking membership streams do not have...
3271720	3274720	Sorry, I'm like straight up talking when there's a thing.
3276720	3278720	No, it does not come...
3278720	3282720	Right, your peric is being sent for review, it said...
3283720	3285720	$5.99!
3287720	3291720	That's so expensive, I'm going to have to stream way more than...
3291720	3293720	I'm going to have to stream more to earn that,
3293720	3296720	because $5.99 is really getting expensive.
3297720	3300720	Does it even display the damn thing?
3300720	3302720	I don't think so.
3305720	3307720	Right, it doesn't display it,
3307720	3310720	because it's not been approved by YouTube, question mark.
3312720	3314720	It's $1.
3314720	3317720	So like, all the tier twos will be reset.
3317720	3321720	So the tier twos can upgrade via $1.99.
3321720	3324720	You already stream more than most, it's no problem.
3324720	3327720	We can buy one less candy per month.
3327720	3329720	You already stream every day.
3329720	3333720	Yeah, well you're ready for multiple streams in one day of different things?
3333720	3334720	Yeah.
3334720	3337720	Am I losing my membership tier?
3338720	3339720	Maybe.
3342720	3345720	Why does it not work?
3346720	3348720	Why does it not work?
3350720	3353720	So what does it say? Is it there?
3353720	3355720	No, it's not been approved, so you can't see it.
3356720	3359720	Elliebot, thank you for the membership upgrade.
3359720	3361720	Why does it specify you upgraded?
3361720	3363720	That's so specific.
3363720	3365720	Oh no, more streams, oh no.
3365720	3367720	Thank you for fixing that.
3367720	3370720	Yes, so we need to wait for YouTube to approve the new tier,
3370720	3373720	and then that's the actual tier.
3373720	3377720	I guess, but I don't know how long it takes to get it approved.
3378720	3382720	I wonder, actually, I wonder if YouTube is going to be able to see
3382720	3384720	that it's so similar to the second one,
3384720	3386720	and they're going to be like, yeah, you're dumb.
3386720	3388720	You praised it wrong, didn't you?
3388720	3390720	And I'm like, yes, I praised it wrong, please forgive me.
3390720	3392720	I'm sorry.
3392720	3395720	And then YouTube will be like, I will have mercy on your soul.
3396720	3398720	Your levels are approved, published.
3398720	3400720	Wait, what? I already got approved?
3400720	3401720	Wait.
3402720	3404720	Hello, YouTube? Are you watching me right now?
3404720	3406720	I promise I'm not doing anything bad.
3406720	3409720	Feet are a natural part of the body.
3409720	3411720	Thank you for monetizing me, YouTube.
3411720	3412720	Please don't take it away.
3412720	3414720	Is YouTube actually here right now?
3414720	3416720	Why did it just get approved?
3416720	3418720	Is it approved? Is it live?
3418720	3420720	Wait, hold on, let me try it.
3421720	3423720	Oh, okay. Wow, it is.
3423720	3424720	Okay, right.
3424720	3427720	I'm going to delete the other tier.
3427720	3429720	Okay, thank you for upgrading.
3429720	3431720	Did I delete it now?
3431720	3433720	And then, oh my God, everyone's upgrading.
3433720	3434720	Thank you so much.
3434720	3436720	I'm so sorry, Mifflins.
3436720	3437720	I'm so, so sorry.
3437720	3439720	I've completely messed this.
3439720	3442720	I've absolutely balled this one up.
3442720	3445720	Right, I will delete the...
3445720	3446720	How do I delete it?
3446720	3447720	I do.
3447720	3448720	I will delete it.
3448720	3449720	Delete this level.
3449720	3452720	If you delete a level, members of that level will lose their membership.
3452720	3454720	Consider notifying them before deleting,
3454720	3456720	encouraging them to change levels.
3456720	3460720	Any member that purchases this level this month will be reimbursed.
3460720	3461720	Okay, that's good.
3461720	3466720	Any member that purchased this level this month will be reimbursed.
3466720	3470720	Okay, YouTube, I'm reading that myself.
3470720	3473720	Once you submit your changes, they'll get approved.
3473720	3474720	Delete.
3474720	3479720	Next, submit and review.
3479720	3482720	I understand that once my offer is reviewed and approved,
3482720	3484720	all members of deleted levels will lose their membership
3484720	3487720	and will be reimbursed for the last month.
3487720	3489720	Okay, submit for review.
3489720	3491720	We're doing it live.
3491720	3493720	Okay, we're doing it live.
3493720	3495720	Do it live.
3495720	3497720	Publish.
3497720	3499720	Did that work?
3499720	3501720	What does it say now?
3501720	3502720	Wait, hold on, let me refresh.
3502720	3504720	Hold on, I think we did it.
3504720	3505720	Hold on, pause.
3505720	3507720	I think we did it.
3507720	3508720	We did it.
3508720	3511720	Okay, I will not mess up with the girls,
3511720	3512720	but I will...
3512720	3514720	Okay, there we go.
3514720	3516720	I believe it's fully working now.
3516720	3520720	If you do gift memberships, it will only go to refling emotes,
3520720	3522720	which I need to add a sugar ton to
3522720	3525720	because it was like, you're only allowed to add four emotes
3525720	3527720	until you get more members,
3527720	3531720	so I'll add to the rest and I'll commission a ton more
3531720	3533720	because with that amount of membership,
3533720	3537720	I think there's quite more than 10 slots that I have.
3537720	3540720	Thank you so much for your patience for me doing this.
3540720	3543720	Thank you everyone who's upgrading to the new tier.
3543720	3550720	I do apologize for the mistake.
3550720	3555720	I really severely wanted membership gifting to be on emotes only
3555720	3560720	because I didn't want to charge more than $5.99.
3560720	3563720	No, $4.99.
3563720	3565720	Thank you everyone who's upgrading.
3565720	3567720	Can I see your upgrades?
3567720	3568720	Nope.
3568720	3571720	Stream Ellen's just really doesn't like it.
3571720	3574720	That's very curious.
3574720	3577720	Very curious indeed.
3577720	3580720	But I won't mess up for the girls when I enable it.
3580720	3582720	I don't know if and when.
3582720	3584720	I don't know if she's doing hers right now.
3584720	3587720	If she is, it's a surprise.
3587720	3592720	I don't know if I'm the only one who's currently doing the membership member.
3592720	3594720	Oh my god, I don't think.
3594720	3597720	Wait, it's not telling me the upgrades?
3597720	3600720	No.
3600720	3604720	It's not telling me when you've upgraded.
3604720	3606720	Like on my screen, on any screen.
3606720	3607720	I'm so sorry.
3607720	3609720	I don't think I can keep up with the upgrades.
3609720	3610720	Thank you everyone who's upgrading.
3610720	3611720	I appreciate it.
3611720	3612720	I'm so sorry.
3612720	3613720	I suck.
3613720	3615720	I suck as a streamer.
3615720	3620720	My apologies for such an unprofessional start.
3620720	3624720	But then again, is it really me if it's not unprofessional?
3624720	3625720	It's so over.
3625720	3626720	No.
3626720	3628720	We will support the cut for this regard.
3628720	3629720	Thank you.
3629720	3631720	I think it's not an upgrade now because the tier is gone.
3631720	3633720	So it's just a new membership.
3633720	3636720	It's not registered.
3636720	3641720	Oh wait, is it registered?
3641720	3642720	Oh no.
3642720	3643720	This can't be.
3643720	3647720	Wait, how am I supposed to...
3647720	3651720	Oh wow, so it's not even telling me if it's an upgrade now.
3651720	3652720	Okay, this is good.
3652720	3656720	Membership note showing in your stream elements is a bug with your stream elements account.
3656720	3659720	I've contacted their support about it.
3659720	3664720	I wonder if the stream elements is for Twitch really.
3664720	3669720	But thank you so much everyone for upgrading or becoming a member of the tier.
3669720	3673720	I actually can't remember if I've said it wrong.
3673720	3675720	We can just send it.
3675720	3677720	You're more professional than many streamers.
3677720	3679720	You treat us like humans.
3679720	3682720	Who streams and doesn't treat you like a human?
3682720	3683720	What?
3683720	3686720	Please tell me there's not actually streamers like that.
3686720	3691720	I remember when you guys taught me that people get actually jealous.
3691720	3695720	Like if they see you in someone else's chat and I'm like, huh?
3695720	3696720	That's real?
3696720	3699720	Because I thought you guys were memeing on me, like teaching me this.
3699720	3707720	And I'm like, wait, some VTubers expect you to solely watch them and only them.
3707720	3709720	It was very eye-opening.
3709720	3711720	Very eye-opening.
3711720	3713720	Boy, thank you for the tip.
3713720	3714720	Alert this.
3714720	3718720	For some reason, I can see that on stream elements, but nothing else.
3718720	3722720	I can see if someone gifts membership on stream elements as well.
3722720	3723720	But that's it.
3723720	3725720	This bit was off.
3725720	3727720	Some people are a bit cray-cray about it.
3727720	3730720	I used to be sweating right now.
3730720	3732720	That was slightly different.
3732720	3734720	I understand where she said that.
3734720	3736720	Yeah, it's a lot more common than you think.
3736720	3738720	I'm only going to have time for you to try.
3738720	3742720	It's a lot more than 12 hours streams, yeah.
3742720	3745720	Oh, thank you for the gifted membership.
3745720	3749720	iPor, thank you.
3749720	3751720	Oh, you need to allow gifts.
3751720	3755720	There may be a prompt in chat right now to allow gifts.
3755720	3757720	Make sure you click it.
3757720	3759720	Thank you.
3759720	3763720	It will say that you can receive gifts.
3763720	3765720	I don't know how it works.
3765720	3767720	My membership just got refunded.
3767720	3768720	Did I miss something?
3768720	3778720	Yes, I had to change the price because gifted membership was the wrong price.
3778720	3780720	So thank you, everyone, who's resubbing.
3780720	3786720	I believe you got a refund question mark question mark, which is really good.
3786720	3796720	It's so sweet.
3796720	3797720	Yeah, we all got refunded.
3797720	3798720	That was really quick.
3798720	3801720	Honestly, shout out to YouTube if everyone literally got refunded.
3801720	3803720	That was so quick.
3803720	3805720	Where is the join button on mobile?
3805720	3806720	Get right, you're on mobile.
3806720	3808720	There is no join button.
3808720	3810720	It's just a mystery.
3810720	3815720	The join button is more of a suggestion than actual rules.
3815720	3817720	Thank you, everyone, for resubbing.
3817720	3819720	I'm so sorry.
3819720	3821720	T.W., thank you for resubbing.
3821720	3829720	Giving Kitsuny, Consulus, Lolliwika, Conrad, Asterix.
3829720	3831720	I'm like pretty sure I've said all these names before.
3831720	3834720	I'm so sorry to anyone whose name I haven't said before.
3834720	3837720	The join button is on the YouTube page.
3837720	3846720	Oh, if you want my YouTube page, apparently.
3846720	3847720	Cookie Fumplur.
3847720	3852720	You guys have such funny gamer tags, honestly.
3852720	3855720	Sorry, I meant 21 Bibboots over 21 days.
3855720	3856720	Not all at once.
3856720	3857720	I was in a rush to get a brain rot.
3857720	3858720	I was about to clarify.
3858720	3860720	Okay, I was going to say that was quite the length.
3860720	3863720	Being inspired by the 21 days of brushing me.
3863720	3865720	The microplastics will be purged.
3865720	3867720	Oh, that's a good, I like that.
3867720	3871720	I subscribed on desktop with PayPal on the old 4.99.
3871720	3872720	So what now?
3872720	3875720	YouTube should have already refunded you apparently.
3875720	3880720	Apparently everyone already got refunded like within seconds.
3880720	3887720	So the new tier is $1 more due to the fact that Gifted Membership will go to Emote Tier,
3887720	3889720	which was what I wanted.
3889720	3893720	But I was so stubborn and like, oh yeah, YouTube.
3893720	3899720	I'm sure YouTube will make sure that you can't donate streams at that price.
3899720	3900720	But no, no.
3900720	3902720	YouTube insisted.
3902720	3904720	YouTube insisted.
3906720	3908720	PayPal learned me what's pending.
3908720	3909720	It should.
3909720	3913720	VTuber Foot Connoisseur, thank you.
3913720	3915720	What a name.
3915720	3919720	What a name to show up in this stream with.
3919720	3921720	What a name.
3921720	3923720	Thank you for becoming a member.
3923720	3924720	That's hilarious.
3924720	3925720	Mika's biggest fan.
3925720	3929720	I'm thinking Mika, Mika, Uwe.
3929720	3932720	Art Bomb Biscuit, thank you.
3932720	3933720	What a name.
3933720	3935720	Honestly, you like the French tip?
3935720	3937720	Is this dinner for you?
3937720	3938720	That's right.
3938720	3943720	Where other VTubers don't provide, I come sweeping in on week one.
3943720	3946720	Week one, I give you what you seek.
3946720	3948720	He really is a connoisseur.
3948720	3950720	How's the winded tour doing?
3950720	3954720	I had to take painkillers because it's getting a bit sore.
3955720	3960720	I may or may not be making a doctor's appointment about my toe.
3960720	3961720	Because something...
3961720	3963720	I'm going to see what happens.
3963720	3968720	I'm going to go for a bath after the stream and let it sweat it out, like in the hot water.
3968720	3975720	In Vulcan, Black Blood, Zafarian, Jacob of Thru.
3975720	3977720	I still forgot this is week one.
3977720	3980720	I mean technical, well, we're just entered week two, I guess.
3980720	3986720	But if YouTube stats updated immediately, we would have been monetized day one.
3986720	3988720	But it took a whole week for it to thingy.
3988720	3989720	This is week two, my apology.
3989720	3990720	Fee.
3990720	3991720	Yes.
3991720	3992720	Fee.
3992720	3994720	I'm so sorry if you don't like immersion breaking.
3994720	3997720	Although I am literally as white as night.
3997720	4000720	I'm actually, I'm so white, I'm transparent.
4000720	4001720	What the heck did I just move there?
4001720	4005720	You can literally see my veins in the blue.
4005720	4007720	You didn't know veins are blue.
4007720	4010720	They carry deoxygenated blood back to your heart.
4010720	4015720	They also have back blow valves, which are really good.
4015720	4020720	It stops the blood from going backwards in your system.
4020720	4024720	Because if your blood ever goes backwards, that's very, very, very bad.
4024720	4029720	Yeah, you're probably not going to make it if your blood starts going backwards.
4029720	4031720	Strunnies, paralysis and everything.
4031720	4032720	Yes.
4032720	4035720	And then your arteries are what the little red veins are.
4035720	4036720	All the redness.
4036720	4040720	That's pushing oxygenated blood to where it's needed.
4040720	4043720	And then your circulatory system takes care of the rest.
4043720	4044720	It's really quite fascinating.
4044720	4046720	You could also talk about the heart.
4046720	4047720	If you like.
4047720	4049720	Today, thank you for signing up.
4049720	4051720	Oh, you've got a banding of Isaac.
4051720	4055720	This, what's that, X?
4055720	4057720	The fucking laser one.
4057720	4059720	That's a...
4059720	4061720	Sass and frizz.
4061720	4062720	That's swine up.
4062720	4066720	You guys really Pokemon and video game pictures.
4066720	4067720	That's quite cool.
4067720	4068720	Thank you for signing up.
4068720	4069720	Your feet are beautiful.
4069720	4070720	Don't worry.
4070720	4071720	Theans, yeah.
4071720	4074720	You like seeing the deoxygenated blood pumping through these veins?
4080720	4082720	I can't wait for you to play Binding of Isaac.
4082720	4086720	November, I'm just warning you all right now.
4086720	4090720	November is when Binding of Isaac's 10-year anniversary is
4090720	4093720	and Molly Player is unlocked.
4093720	4095720	I am not going to be off that from...
4095720	4097720	You can see my hands in the shadow.
4097720	4100720	I am instructing you.
4100720	4107720	I am not going to be off that game for a very long time.
4107720	4108720	Okay?
4108720	4109720	Do you understand?
4109720	4110720	Refling.
4110720	4112720	And then you all say I understand.
4112720	4113720	Mame in unison.
4113720	4114720	Okay?
4114720	4118720	We're going to be playing multiplayer Isaac all day long.
4118720	4119720	Multiple days.
4119720	4120720	Am I even...
4120720	4128720	Am I even commit to a week and alienate more people with my Binding of Isaac?
4128720	4130720	Just so you understand.
4130720	4132720	But thank you all for signing off.
4132720	4133720	I understand.
4133720	4134720	I understand, Mame.
4134720	4135720	I understand, Mame.
4135720	4136720	I understand.
4136720	4137720	Yes.
4137720	4138720	Good reflings.
4138720	4139720	Good reflings.
4139720	4141720	You will be rewarded for your...
4141720	4145720	Sorry, I didn't realize how much my shadow was casting over.
4145720	4147720	You will be rewarded.
4147720	4150720	Wait, if you can see my shadow...
4150720	4152720	No, we'll do that in a membership.
4152720	4154720	That was a very bad idea.
4154720	4155720	That was a terrible idea.
4155720	4157720	I don't want any of your little ears cleaned.
4157720	4161720	Let me pick up this Q-tip or this ear cleaner.
4161720	4165720	Let me just pick up this ear cleaner.
4166720	4167720	I understand.
4167720	4169720	Right, over here you go.
4169720	4171720	Just need to hold it like a bit.
4171720	4172720	Oh, I dropped it.
4172720	4173720	It's not very good.
4173720	4176720	It's actually quite hard to utilize this.
4176720	4177720	Put it...
4177720	4178720	There we go.
4178720	4180720	Right, you ready for some ear cleaning?
4180720	4181720	Oh, poor you.
4181720	4184720	See, if you get trapped water in your ear, don't worry too much.
4184720	4187720	Your ear can expel it at a later time.
4187720	4193720	Some people actually find that expelling of the water in your ear quite...
4193720	4196720	Oh wait, you can't even see me touch the thing.
4196720	4197720	This is...
4197720	4201720	Right, I'm going to do a basic 101.
4201720	4202720	Sorry, I'm a whisper.
4202720	4203720	I need a whisper.
4203720	4204720	I'm getting too passionate.
4204720	4209720	I'm going to show you a basic 101 for any ASMR artist that's watching right now.
4209720	4210720	Okay?
4210720	4213720	And I know this is very hypocritical because I've just bashed the ear about...
4213720	4216720	I'm going to teach you this right now live.
4216720	4217720	Okay?
4219720	4221720	You see this ear?
4221720	4222720	Inside this ear?
4222720	4224720	This black section?
4224720	4226720	This is what you don't do, okay?
4226720	4228720	This is what you don't do.
4243720	4245720	No ASMRs.
4245720	4249720	You go around the microphone.
4249720	4252720	Around gently, okay?
4254720	4259720	Don't ever touch this bit here.
4259720	4262720	That's the microphone, okay?
4262720	4265720	But go around the ear.
4265720	4268720	Gentle strokes.
4268720	4272720	Gentle, gentle, gentle, gentle, okay?
4272720	4274720	Gentle strokes.
4274720	4275720	That's all you need.
4275720	4278720	Just gentle movements.
4279720	4281720	Gentle, gentle.
4281720	4282720	Okay?
4282720	4284720	There, 101 ASMR.
4284720	4286720	That's all you need to know.
4289720	4294720	This, I'm going to try and avoid doing with the toe.
4294720	4296720	Just around the ear.
4296720	4297720	You don't need to go inside.
4297720	4298720	No, no, no, no.
4298720	4299720	I know.
4299720	4301720	I know you guys like to rush into it, okay?
4301720	4303720	Why are you covered in band-aids?
4303720	4306720	I caught myself making food.
4306720	4310720	I hurt myself on my fingy.
4310720	4312720	So I have to put a band-aid on.
4312720	4317720	I'm a bit of, which is known as a clutch.
4317720	4319720	Thank you.
4319720	4321720	I had nothing.
4321720	4322720	I drank my karma.
4322720	4324720	The ceremony, or Bubba the Great.
4324720	4326720	I appreciate it.
4327720	4329720	Wait.
4335720	4338720	Does that mean you were making food with your foot?
4338720	4343720	No, this, I got all my toes done at the same time.
4343720	4347720	But this part, so when you get your toes done,
4347720	4350720	they take clippers and they take this like push thing.
4350720	4354720	They like pushed all my, like, toe skin back and stuff.
4354720	4357720	But this section on this toe, she has cut,
4357720	4359720	I was actually kind of sore touching that.
4359720	4360720	I'm not even going to lie,
4360720	4364720	she cut and sliced into it as she was cutting my toenail.
4364720	4368720	And it's quite sore and I'm not really sure what to do.
4368720	4372720	I've not really experienced such a problem before,
4372720	4375720	but we will, we'll be fine.
4375720	4377720	I think we'll be okay.
4377720	4380720	Thank you, Star Killer, for becoming a member.
4381720	4384720	Do you guys want me to flip you instead?
4391720	4395720	Wait a minute, I got a freaking tiny...
4397720	4400720	Seems like you forgot her pronounce my name from yesterday.
4400720	4403720	Spain-ee, lol.
4403720	4405720	Spain-ee, that's what I said.
4405720	4407720	Anyway, I'm off to work, see you later and congrats on monetization.
4407720	4410720	Thank you for the tip and yes, thank you.
4410720	4413720	Spain-ee, you could literally hear me like be scared to say it
4413720	4416720	because I say it wrong all the time.
4416720	4418720	Starny, do you have a stethoscope?
4418720	4421720	No, I don't.
4421720	4425720	That would be quite the prop for ASMR, honestly,
4425720	4428720	having a stethoscope.
4428720	4431720	You push back the cuticle, the nail bit cleaner,
4431720	4433720	but the actual tool lining is not a cuticle.
4433720	4436720	You should probably get it right, Muckers.
4436720	4438720	This is great, but I have class now.
4438720	4439720	Okay, enjoy class.
4439720	4442720	Get educated, get educated, get educated, get through will.
4442720	4445720	Epsom salt foot bath, yeah.
4445720	4448720	I think I'd make just something like that,
4448720	4450720	because it's a wee bit sore.
4450720	4453720	I heard someone say use it for heartbeat ASMR.
4453720	4456720	Oh, would that even work?
4456720	4457720	I don't know, we tried.
4457720	4459720	I wouldn't mind buying that prop.
4459720	4462720	I will buy that prop with my membership money.
4462720	4464720	Thank you, wonderful members.
4465720	4467720	I hope we're full of heels, yeah.
4467720	4468720	I think we'll be fine, right?
4468720	4473720	Sorry, let me look at the Q and A questions on marshmallow.
4473720	4475720	Congrats on the membership.
4475720	4477720	You're the goodest girl around.
4477720	4478720	What is your favourite meal to eat?
4478720	4481720	Savery, something savory.
4481720	4485720	Hello, will Patreon subs get to see the membership streams on Patreon?
4485720	4488720	Nope, they are two different subscriptions.
4488720	4492720	Patreon and YouTube activity are two separate things.
4492720	4496720	So, if you're interested in seeing your girl,
4496720	4500720	your Oshidevs live, then that is more YouTube orientated.
4500720	4503720	If you're interested in the alternative content
4503720	4507720	that any member of Veiler offers, that is what is on Patreon.
4507720	4510720	Thank you for your question.
4510720	4513720	You have big feet for a woman.
4513720	4516720	Okay, wow.
4516720	4518720	I don't know what you want me to do with that.
4518720	4520720	You may sign up for basketball.
4520720	4521720	Right, sorry, let me just end the stream.
4521720	4523720	I'm going to contact NBA.
4523720	4524720	Big feet?
4524720	4526720	You think I have big feet?
4526720	4527720	Are you sure it's not perspective,
4527720	4530720	because you have nothing else to judge?
4530720	4532720	Literally, what?
4532720	4533720	Big feet is good.
4533720	4534720	Your feet are great.
4534720	4536720	Literally, everyone's been saying my feet are cute and stuff,
4536720	4538720	and then you come to me and you're like, yeah, your feet are massive.
4538720	4539720	I'm sorry, do you want me to bind them?
4539720	4541720	Like, we're in fucking China or something?
4541720	4543720	Like, back when they used to bind the lowest feet?
4543720	4544720	Is that what you want?
4544720	4546720	You want a little fucking lowest feet?
4546720	4549720	Get out of here with that shit.
4549720	4552720	I don't know anything about feet, but they're normal feet.
4552720	4555720	Yeah, I'm just like...
4555720	4557720	Like, oh, sorry, excuse me.
4557720	4559720	Oh, I see.
4559720	4561720	When I spawned in, when I spawned in,
4561720	4563720	I actually picked the foot size manually.
4563720	4565720	You know, there's a little slider bar and everything.
4565720	4566720	Banana for scale.
4566720	4568720	I don't even have bananas.
4568720	4573720	Oh, do you want my stoop waffle that I ate yesterday for scale?
4573720	4574720	There, there's your scale.
4574720	4576720	Your stoop waffle.
4576720	4577720	Your fear.
4577720	4578720	Thank you.
4578720	4579720	No sense of permanence.
4579720	4585720	I'm just going to assume you're a talking pair of feet, honestly.
4585720	4586720	Who said that?
4586720	4587720	Who?
4587720	4588720	I don't know.
4588720	4589720	What feet size are you?
4589720	4593720	I actually don't know.
4593720	4594720	I've not bought...
4594720	4595720	I bought...
4595720	4597720	When did I buy a new pair of shoes?
4597720	4598720	I completely forgot.
4598720	4601720	I had to get measured for them actually when I got a new pair of shoes
4601720	4607720	because I didn't know what my shoe size was.
4608720	4610720	I don't know what to say here, to be honest,
4610720	4613720	but I'm glad for Shibi Dome Momaya.
4613720	4615720	She's really cute and the gap was really nice.
4615720	4616720	Sorry, Stroney.
4616720	4618720	And the year-long wait was worth it.
4618720	4620720	Aw, I'm glad to think so.
4620720	4621720	Yeah.
4621720	4624720	Some people were asking, like,
4624720	4625720	weren't you worried about, like,
4625720	4627720	everyone being disappointed after a year's wait?
4627720	4629720	And I'm like, I'm sorry,
4629720	4631720	but if you're, if you're a wifelin',
4631720	4633720	you knew what, you knew we were mean men.
4633720	4634720	You knew I was rambling.
4634720	4636720	You knew exactly what was going on.
4636720	4637720	Merci.
4637720	4639720	When are you doing your membership stream
4639720	4641720	for no particular reason?
4643720	4645720	Star Killer, thank you.
4645720	4649720	Nayudi Julie, thank you.
4654720	4656720	Swirly Lexa 6.
4656720	4657720	You have...
4657720	4658720	Thank you for signing up.
4658720	4659720	Your profile picture around me,
4659720	4661720	I could have bought a frickin' hypno thing
4661720	4664720	and put it on the floor and hypnotise people to my feet.
4664720	4665720	My feet?
4665720	4667720	They're gonna be so funny though.
4667720	4668720	I can't put it off.
4668720	4669720	Jesus.
4669720	4670720	Fuckin'...
4676720	4678720	Okay, that's a bit too hard.
4678720	4679720	We're squishing the ball.
4679720	4680720	We're going back to squishing the ball.
4680720	4682720	It's so easy to squish a ball.
4688720	4689720	Feet cam...
4689720	4690720	Feet stream Q&A.
4690720	4693720	Will you ever beat the Peeler Alligator?
4693720	4695720	I don't think so.
4699720	4702720	So when the girls started posting it for free,
4702720	4703720	I was like,
4703720	4705720	oh, I was gonna do a donut-on-reward
4705720	4708720	where I wrap my 3D weapon like a poly bag,
4708720	4710720	like a plastic bag,
4710720	4713720	hypnotising the reefing through your feet
4713720	4715720	to convince them I worshipped the feet, honestly.
4715720	4717720	Goes in a straw knee stream.
4717720	4720720	Your feet are big, good for gathering produce all day.
4720720	4722720	So, literally, I was like,
4722720	4724720	I've never seen you in my life.
4728720	4730720	And now you want to do it for free?
4730720	4731720	Yeah.
4731720	4733720	I was gonna make it a fun donut-on-reward
4733720	4736720	because I was gonna do it on 3D all night.
4736720	4738720	But I need to wrap it up to make sure it doesn't,
4738720	4740720	you know, short circuit.
4741720	4743720	What is this about being in a bag?
4743720	4745720	Might need that stream.
4746720	4747720	Hey.
4747720	4748720	Oh, reefing.
4748720	4749720	Oh, what a pee.
4749720	4751720	Peas on you.
4757720	4759720	You still can.
4760720	4761720	Wow.
4761720	4763720	3D MoMA?
4763720	4764720	That's terrible, honestly.
4764720	4767720	Oh, my, like, donut-on-plans are absolutely outrageous.
4767720	4768720	Someone says,
4768720	4769720	hi, love you.
4769720	4770720	That's all.
4770720	4771720	Love you, reefing.
4771720	4773720	Someone says, Pokemon or Digimon?
4773720	4775720	I only saw Pokemon.
4775720	4777720	I never got into Digimon.
4777720	4779720	Because wasn't the Digimon meme
4779720	4781720	that's literally, like,
4783720	4785720	this, like, cute adorable thing
4785720	4788720	ends up developing, like, an AK-47.
4789720	4791720	And, like, a galeel on one arm,
4791720	4793720	a Famous on the other.
4795720	4797720	The only big thing Strenny has
4797720	4799720	is her...
4799720	4801720	her...
4801720	4802720	her heart.
4802720	4805720	She has a really big heart.
4805720	4807720	Hearing your feet sweat
4807720	4808720	stick to the ball
4808720	4809720	reminds me of ear coughing
4809720	4811720	when the hand leaves the ear.
4811720	4812720	Oh, stop.
4812720	4813720	Wait, I think my feet are sweating
4813720	4815720	off to do your Pokemon vlog.
4815720	4817720	What does this sound like?
4829720	4830720	Oh, that's great.
4830720	4832720	Oh, you actually like it?
4833720	4836720	Thank you, Destiny, to enjoy your cave.
4839720	4841720	It sounds nice.
4841720	4842720	Pokemon vlog.
4842720	4843720	Can I do two at...
4843720	4844720	Can I do both?
4844720	4845720	Hold on.
4845720	4848720	I think I can do the Joe-Wheeled ear cupping.
4850720	4852720	Oh, sorry, I just peaked the audio.
4854720	4856720	It's a bit more difficult this way.
4857720	4859720	It sounds good.
4859720	4862720	Wait, there really are sticking to the ear.
4862720	4864720	Did you miss the Pop Rock segment
4864720	4866720	where I proved how sweaty my feet are
4866720	4868720	via Pop Rocking?
4869720	4871720	I just realized the mic is swapped.
4871720	4872720	Is it?
4872720	4873720	Oh, no.
4876720	4877720	Is it on the wrong side?
4877720	4880720	I can swap it out manually if you want.
4882720	4885720	Peaking the audio just means you're peeking.
4887720	4890720	You want to hear my heartbeat from my foot?
4891720	4893720	I don't know if I can do that.
4898720	4900720	I don't think you can hear it.
4904720	4905720	I go here 10 minutes ago.
4905720	4907720	Yeah, the start of the stream.
4908720	4911720	I may or may not have opened up Pop Rocks
4911720	4913720	and put them on the soles of my feet
4913720	4915720	to prove how sweaty my feet are.
4915720	4917720	And they popped.
4917720	4919720	No outside influence necessary.
4919720	4923720	So I have proven that I do have hyperhydrolysis.
4924720	4926720	Not that anyone needed proof.
4926720	4928720	I don't know why you would make up such an accusation
4928720	4929720	in all honesty.
4929720	4931720	Why would anyone want it?
4932720	4936720	Thank you, glacial soles.
4939720	4940720	Yeah.
4941720	4943720	Oh, tapping ASMR.
4945720	4946720	So fancy.
4949720	4951720	I get sweaty feet too, yeah.
4951720	4954720	Just as a mild warning to anyone who's listening,
4954720	4957720	if you have permanent sweaty hands and feet,
4957720	4961720	please do consider autism.
4961720	4963720	That's all, that's my note.
4965720	4967720	Can we do toe tapping ASMR?
4970720	4971720	Oh, yes.
4975720	4978720	Yes, it's actually a very common satrate
4978720	4981720	of having autism
4981720	4984720	by having permanently sweaty hands and feet.
4986720	4988720	What if you have hairy palms?
4988720	4991720	I don't actually know.
4991720	4994720	Maybe you're Italian, because aren't Italians hairy?
4995720	4997720	I am acoustic.
4997720	5000720	Oh, that explains a lot actually.
5000720	5001720	Yeah.
5002720	5004720	We have strong autism though.
5006720	5009720	Little toe tapping ASMR, that's right.
5009720	5010720	That's right.
5010720	5012720	Average VTuber will recharge thousands for this
5012720	5013720	in a donor phone.
5013720	5015720	Me, you get it for free.
5016720	5019720	I never noticed it until you actually mentioned it,
5019720	5021720	but yeah, I do have autism and sweaty hands and feet.
5021720	5023720	Yeah, it's a very common trait.
5024720	5026720	If you are...
5027720	5030720	Depending on the scale, however you want to scale,
5030720	5032720	you can do it different ways,
5032720	5035720	but if you are on the high need side of autism,
5035720	5038720	if you do toe walking only,
5038720	5041720	that is a massive indicator, a humongous indicator
5041720	5044720	that you are kind of on the upper scale
5044720	5046720	of the present needs.
5046720	5050720	Thank you, Jin Azuru channel.
5050720	5052720	And thank you, Krax.
5053720	5054720	Krax.
5058720	5059720	I used to have...
5059720	5061720	I have to use antiperspirant on my feet anytime I had,
5061720	5063720	otherwise it's blistering.
5063720	5065720	Huh, I never noticed that before,
5065720	5066720	but you're right about the sweaty feet.
5066720	5067720	Yeah.
5068720	5070720	The toe walking is too real.
5070720	5073720	Toe walking is a humongous indicator
5073720	5077720	that the child, that normally it's noticed in childhood,
5077720	5081720	you can unlearn it as you get older,
5081720	5083720	but it's a massive indicator.
5084720	5085720	I used to toe walk all the time.
5085720	5088720	Yes, it is one of the biggest giveaways
5088720	5091720	of a child's autistic,
5091720	5093720	basically, if they toe walk.
5094720	5097720	Got used to some powers for goods.
5097720	5099720	Literally, well, like, without mine,
5099720	5101720	like, I had...
5102720	5105720	I stopped at VTubers, I've been stroking my ego.
5105720	5107720	They're like, I don't know how you do it.
5107720	5109720	I don't know how you stream.
5109720	5112720	I'm like, do I tell them the truth
5112720	5114720	and the reason I can stream all the time
5114720	5116720	is because I have to?
5116720	5118720	Or am I just like, oh, I'm just really passionate.
5118720	5120720	I just really like what I get to do.
5123720	5125720	For me, it's always sitting in weird ways
5125720	5127720	that put so much pressure on my feet
5127720	5129720	that I keep getting callused feet.
5130720	5131720	I toe run, is that similar?
5131720	5134720	Toe running, maybe isn't the biggest indicator
5134720	5137720	in children, but then like,
5137720	5139720	you can start getting stimulated.
5139720	5141720	She's unstoppable.
5142720	5144720	I walked on toes as a child
5144720	5146720	and then my feet are...
5146720	5149720	Don't be shy, you can finish the rest of your sentence.
5150720	5151720	We don't bite here.
5151720	5153720	We don't bite from around these folks.
5155720	5156720	I got...
5156720	5159720	Do you remember that South Park episode about us?
5159720	5161720	This is enough toe tapping.
5161720	5162720	What else can I do?
5162720	5163720	I freaking...
5163720	5165720	I've brought this stick in.
5165720	5167720	Some people, like, wouldn't stick ASMR.
5167720	5170720	I've never particularly found it easy to record it.
5170720	5173720	So the only thing I can do really is just tapping,
5173720	5175720	like, on the ear.
5179720	5182720	Any other major indications of tism?
5182720	5184720	There's time.
5184720	5186720	I don't know.
5186720	5188720	Any other major indications of tism?
5188720	5191720	There's tons, like,
5191720	5195720	stimming with hands, lack of eye contact is a big one.
5196720	5198720	My biggest question to you,
5198720	5200720	if you're sitting here and you're like,
5200720	5201720	hold on a minute, she's starting to...
5201720	5202720	she's spitting the truth.
5202720	5205720	My biggest question, if you genuinely are like,
5205720	5208720	huh, is how different would the world look
5208720	5211720	if everyone thought like you?
5211720	5212720	How different would the world look
5212720	5213720	if everyone thought like you?
5213720	5214720	And before you're like,
5214720	5215720	that's not an indication,
5215720	5217720	just think about it a bit more.
5217720	5220720	Okay, just think a little bit deeper into that question.
5220720	5222720	Okay?
5222720	5226720	Anyway, gifts are messed up.
5226720	5229720	Everyone's getting tier two, one dollar
5229720	5232720	for something we really wanted, so why?
5235720	5238720	One more dollar for something we really wanted, so why?
5240720	5242720	Wait, was that because...
5245720	5247720	Oh wait, is this an old...
5247720	5250720	Sorry, this might be an old message.
5252720	5253720	Hold on.
5253720	5255720	Sorry, I'm reading...
5255720	5256720	I'm so happy to have you back.
5256720	5257720	I miss you so much.
5257720	5259720	I miss you too a lot recently.
5259720	5260720	Okay, yeah, sorry.
5260720	5262720	Those were old ones talking about the tier.
5262720	5265720	Thank you for anyone's info about the tiers.
5266720	5270720	World ends up addicted to watching VLM.
5270720	5272720	That's how we take over.
5272720	5275720	You guys thought my hypnosis was to drown you all?
5275720	5277720	No, it was to...
5277720	5278720	I don't know.
5278720	5281720	Oh my god, my feet are sometimes so dirty.
5282720	5284720	I'm gonna put your mops on to protect you
5284720	5287720	because I'm probably gonna mess up shortly.
5289720	5291720	I can get a bit of a mint.
5293720	5296720	Right, let's see where we are.
5299720	5300720	What?
5300720	5302720	You're the strongest, at least mentally,
5302720	5303720	I don't know about physically,
5303720	5306720	like me who struggled to open a can of fizzy juice
5306720	5308720	on the hand-cam stream.
5308720	5309720	Eep.
5309720	5313720	Can I buy or use Band-Aids to put on an alt-art?
5313720	5316720	This one literally has gunk on it.
5316720	5318720	I don't know what's going on with this toe,
5318720	5320720	but we'll figure it out.
5321720	5323720	Girl I've ever known.
5323720	5326720	But someone like you should never mess with infections,
5326720	5328720	get that toe-checked ace up.
5328720	5330720	Oh, Monka Ace, okay.
5330720	5332720	If you had to take painkillers, you can go to the ER,
5332720	5334720	but I know you'll never do it because you're a sweetheart,
5334720	5337720	but somebody else could sue that pedicure.
5337720	5340720	Oh no, she didn't mean it.
5340720	5343720	You should at least show them the medical papers
5343720	5344720	you get from the hospital.
5344720	5347720	Monka Ace, am I going to the hospital because of my toe?
5348720	5352720	I'll tell you what, I'll update you some Twitter after my bath.
5352720	5354720	I'll do a salt plingy and see what happens,
5354720	5357720	because salt normally makes up.
5359720	5363720	Would you be interested in playing Omega Strikers on stream?
5363720	5368720	It's a 3v3 mob-style air hockey that's free to play.
5368720	5370720	Oh my god, that sounds fun.
5370720	5372720	Omega Strikers.
5375720	5380720	Thank you, whoa, and thank you, Panopetition.
5381720	5384720	Oh my god, Omega Strikers looks so cool.
5386720	5388720	All their waifus are cute.
5389720	5391720	Isn't this free to play?
5392720	5394720	Oh no, it's Nintendo.
5395720	5397720	Oh no.
5398720	5400720	It's Nintendo.
5400720	5403720	Nintendo's so expensive.
5403720	5405720	Is it Nintendo?
5410720	5411720	Oh yeah.
5411720	5413720	Oh no, this can't be.
5413720	5415720	This can't be, it can't be Nintendo.
5415720	5417720	Why does it say Nintendo on the top now?
5419720	5420720	It's on PC.
5420720	5421720	Oh okay, it's on PC.
5421720	5423720	Right, whoa, okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
5423720	5425720	If it's on PC, it can't be overcharged that much.
5425720	5428720	If anything is specifically published by Nintendo,
5428720	5431720	just know you're going to get rinsed out ours for the price.
5431720	5433720	It's absolutely ridiculous.
5435720	5436720	Wait, I can see that.
5436720	5437720	It showed up.
5438720	5439720	Panoptition.
5440720	5443720	Panoption, thank you so much for, oh my goodness,
5443720	5445720	all those gifted memberships.
5446720	5448720	Whoa, wait a minute.
5448720	5451720	Stream Elements is assigning your gifts in real time.
5451720	5453720	I can see who's been gifted your gifts.
5454720	5456720	Thank you so much.
5456720	5458720	Congrats to everyone who managed to catch that.
5458720	5460720	You do have to enable it in chat.
5461720	5463720	I'm so sorry, I can hardly say the name.
5463720	5466720	Panoptition, surely it's Panoptition.
5466720	5469720	Panoptition, thank you so much for the 20 gifted, thank you.
5469720	5472720	And congrats to everyone who caught up with their face.
5473720	5475720	It's all coming together.
5476720	5479720	Yes, you'll have to like, I think you have to talk in chat
5479720	5481720	or even if you just say a simple message like hi
5481720	5484720	and then it'll be like you could have got this, enable it.
5490720	5491720	I love you.
5491720	5493720	Will you go on a date with me?
5493720	5495720	You better come to the convention.
5495720	5497720	I'm giving everyone roses.
5497720	5500720	I think if we ever did like an actual convention,
5500720	5503720	I'd love to buy like single roses so I can give it out
5503720	5505720	and I'll be like, ha, that's right.
5505720	5509720	You have beat all the odds of a man never receiving a flower
5509720	5511720	before he is.
5513720	5515720	Hold on, let me hydrate, let me hydrate.
5515720	5524720	Well, convention where?
5524720	5526720	No, there's been no picked convention,
5526720	5530720	but I really want to try it once in my life.
5530720	5532720	I've never been to a convention before.
5532720	5535720	I've never been to like a location that has been
5535720	5540720	self-identified for nerds and dorks like us.
5540720	5544720	So it would be a very unique experience.
5544720	5549720	Wow, that is like literally real-time assigning gifted
5549720	5550720	memberships.
5550720	5552720	That's crazy.
5552720	5554720	That's so cool.
5554720	5557720	Viola Conta.
5557720	5561720	Well, the only thing is I have absolutely crippling,
5561720	5564720	traveling anxiety, which is a bit of a problem.
5564720	5568720	There's a big convention in California, I think,
5568720	5571720	and a lot of the girls would actually be able to make it
5571720	5573720	manually, I think, if we all went.
5573720	5578720	But I don't want to let the team down.
5578720	5583720	There's a lot of issues about getting on a plane.
5583720	5587720	And I get violently motion sick as well.
5587720	5591720	This is why I just want to farm with a U-reflink,
5591720	5594720	because I can't travel anywhere.
5594720	5599720	I get so sick, like I had to get a taxi.
5599720	5602720	I get a taxi to my dentist appointment.
5602720	5604720	And it's not even that far away from me.
5604720	5606720	I was violently ill.
5606720	5608720	I was like, ooh.
5608720	5610720	I was like, can I just put the window down?
5610720	5612720	And the guy's like, yeah, yeah.
5612720	5614720	He's like on his phone talking to his pal and all that.
5614720	5616720	I'm getting scared.
5616720	5618720	Oh.
5618720	5622720	I would use thank you, Nero, for becoming a member.
5622720	5623720	I can see that.
5623720	5627720	Get drunk and pass out on the plane, honestly.
5628720	5630720	I would be so high on medication.
5630720	5632720	See, the problem is I don't want to be like,
5632720	5634720	I'm definitely going to a convention,
5634720	5636720	because I have A-bomb.
5636720	5639720	And A-bomb really messes up things that happen in real life.
5639720	5642720	And I don't want to be like, oh, you should go to this convention
5642720	5645720	in Melbourne on this day at this time.
5645720	5648720	I'll be here, because I don't want anyone to spend money
5648720	5652720	to come out on the sole reason to come see me type thing.
5652720	5656720	Because if my freaking A-bomb gets in the way,
5656720	5660720	I, oh wait, I'll tell it in another stream, okay?
5660720	5663720	But I have a really freaking, it's really frustrating,
5663720	5665720	but it's quite humorous at the same time.
5665720	5668720	But yeah, you could be the one of those robots that meet up.
5668720	5669720	Yeah, that's possible.
5669720	5670720	First Mercy next round.
5670720	5672720	Do all the girls have motion sickness?
5672720	5674720	Oh no, I can still play video games.
5674720	5678720	I have like travel motion sickness.
5678720	5679720	Like a parent.
5679720	5680720	Oh wait, no.
5680720	5682720	She put those goofy goggles on her eyes.
5682720	5684720	I'm pretty sure she did.
5684720	5686720	No, you're right about Mercy.
5686720	5690720	She put those funny goggles on her eyes.
5690720	5692720	What is A-bomb?
5692720	5694720	A-bomb stands for anxiety,
5694720	5696720	because people are sick of hearing about it,
5696720	5697720	like the word anxiety.
5697720	5700720	So I just call it A-bomb as a substitute.
5700720	5703720	It's ear problems?
5703720	5707720	Oh, well I can fix your ear problems with my sweaty feet.
5707720	5710720	Oh yes, oh yes, you can hear that.
5710720	5713720	There's a little tool rubbing ASMR.
5713720	5718720	Yeah, that's right, a little rubber.
5718720	5720720	Maybe you don't see that on airport.
5720720	5726720	Oh no, yeah, we're not going to use that terminology.
5726720	5732720	I think Johnny can fix their ear problems on his Patreon.
5732720	5737720	I mean your motion sickness, sorry.
5737720	5739720	Do you take game suggestions?
5739720	5742720	I do, I have absolutely no issues.
5742720	5745720	A lot of streamers kind of don't...
5745720	5747720	No, that's not nice.
5747720	5748720	I will not generalise.
5748720	5750720	Please don't be afraid to...
5750720	5753720	Dap your bucket, thank you for becoming a member.
5753720	5756720	Please don't be afraid to, you know, ask me questions,
5756720	5760720	or game suggestions are perfectly fine with me,
5760720	5764720	I have no problems.
5764720	5767720	Is that how many people use A-bomb as a word
5767720	5768720	for being mildly introverted?
5768720	5776720	Yes, I kind of generally touch up on the subject
5776720	5779720	just because I am very thankful to be where I am
5779720	5781720	versus where I was,
5781720	5783720	but I feel like people are so tired
5783720	5785720	and burned out hearing about it and like,
5785720	5786720	oh everyone's got it.
5786720	5788720	And I'm like, yeah, I wonder everyone's got it.
5788720	5791720	Have you seen society today?
5791720	5794720	We live in a society, I wonder everyone's got it.
5794720	5795720	Anyway, we can do that.
5795720	5797720	I can talk about that in another stream.
5797720	5800720	This stream is supposed to be me celebrating monetisation
5800720	5802720	and yet again I'm talking about
5802720	5804720	how we need the downfall of society.
5804720	5805720	It's terrible.
5805720	5807720	It's shocking.
5807720	5808720	I've got his DEMPA in here,
5808720	5811720	no way DEMPA is in here staring at my toes right now.
5811720	5813720	Oh, gorgeous.
5813720	5817720	Hi DEMPA, I have no idea what size my feet are.
5817720	5820720	I bought like new shoes last year
5820720	5821720	and they had to measure them
5821720	5825720	and I already forgot my shoes aren't in this room.
5825720	5828720	Sorry DEMPA, I had to be this way.
5828720	5831720	I literally am, I had to be this way.
5834720	5837720	Yeah DEMPA, you should do foot cam ASMR with me.
5837720	5839720	You want to come over?
5839720	5842720	I feel like you would have smaller toes than me.
5842720	5844720	I've never had a pedicure before.
5844720	5846720	Oh, well if you ever get one,
5846720	5848720	just make sure they don't mess up your toe by the way
5848720	5850720	because mine's an agony.
5850720	5854720	You definitely need to be careful with that.
5855720	5857720	Here's my beefling heart.
5857720	5861720	The world is, there's no surprise.
5861720	5863720	I have a broken pinky toe,
5863720	5865720	can you like spread your little,
5865720	5867720	look at my pinky toe, it's a little dance.
5872720	5874720	I don't want someone to touch my feet.
5874720	5880720	Getting a massage is very unique sensation.
5880720	5882720	Very, very unique sensation.
5882720	5885720	DEMPA, I've got a strange feeling somewhere.
5887720	5890720	Poor DEMPA's pinky toe.
5890720	5893720	Are there any game genres you want to avoid?
5893720	5897720	I don't like, oh this is going to be controversial.
5897720	5899720	I might filter some people with this one.
5899720	5903720	The reason, I do not like games like Resident Evil
5903720	5905720	where you give me ammunition,
5905720	5907720	but it does not perish the enemy.
5907720	5910720	Do not give me enemies that cannot be perished.
5910720	5915720	What is the point in having an ammunition resource management section
5915720	5918720	if it does not perish the big bad enemy?
5918720	5920720	Please do not suggest these kinds of games.
5920720	5923720	It will turn into a rage stream real quick
5923720	5927720	and I will become so scots you will not actually be able to understand them.
5927720	5930720	I'm sorry, but do not give me ammunition if it does not perish then.
5930720	5931720	Simple as.
5931720	5933720	I mean, that's fair.
5933720	5934720	Preach.
5934720	5936720	Did you put hydrogen peroxide on it?
5936720	5938720	No, I'm going to take a bath.
5938720	5941720	I'm going to take this off and go for a bath
5941720	5944720	and do salt in the bath.
5944720	5949720	You mean like that 30 bullets to kill that one enemy?
5949720	5950720	Yeah.
5952720	5954720	I'm sure the Resident Evil games are good.
5954720	5956720	However, I have fantastic news.
5956720	5959720	I have five gen mates that are more than likely to play that kind of genre.
5959720	5962720	I've never played Resident Evil.
5962720	5966720	I watched my dad play Resident Evil
5966720	5969720	and it started off in Africa,
5969720	5971720	but he couldn't even get through it
5971720	5973720	and we were both watching it and we were like,
5973720	5975720	well, I was watching him play it
5975720	5977720	and both of us were looking at each other like,
5977720	5978720	what is this?
5978720	5980720	He couldn't get through it.
5980720	5982720	I couldn't get through it.
5982720	5984720	Oh, Res Fat.
5984720	5986720	Yeah, it was like set in Africa or something.
5986720	5990720	It was like super hot Savannah type thing.
5990720	5993720	And both of us were just staring at each other like,
5993720	5996720	this is the biggest piece that we've ever bought.
5996720	5999720	Because normally we play games together,
5999720	6001720	share games together type thing.
6001720	6003720	You watch your dad play the second worst one.
6003720	6005720	Oh, well, there you go.
6005720	6007720	Literally, I think we've got 20 minutes into it
6007720	6009720	and both of us were looking at each other like,
6009720	6011720	yeah, that game's going back.
6011720	6013720	We're going to hand it in for a different game.
6015720	6018720	Is there something you've always wanted to try
6018720	6021720	that you've made for 100% games that you've never wanted to try?
6022720	6026720	I've wanted to play Civ 6.
6030720	6032720	I have done one run on it
6032720	6034720	and I enjoyed it, but I was very dumb.
6034720	6036720	I don't want to play Baldur's Gate.
6036720	6038720	I definitely want to try that for the first time.
6038720	6040720	But I think it will be a patience testing stream
6040720	6043720	because I get worried about playing a game for the first time.
6046720	6049720	Five and six are some of the best solve ones, regardless.
6049720	6051720	Wow, feet for free.
6051720	6053720	Congrats on monetization.
6053720	6055720	Ding!
6055720	6057720	Let's just make sure I didn't lose anything.
6057720	6059720	Right, I think I won.
6061720	6063720	This one says, I think your feet are very beautiful and hot.
6063720	6064720	Thanks. Do you have my toes?
6064720	6066720	I got my toes done.
6067720	6069720	Look at that step piece.
6069720	6071720	Look at that side profile on the toe spread.
6071720	6073720	Can I just get a zoom in and appreciation
6073720	6075720	for the side profile of the toe spread?
6075720	6076720	Yeah.
6076720	6078720	I mean, look at that.
6078720	6080720	You already know. You're welcome.
6080720	6082720	Yeah, you're welcome. You owe me one membership.
6082720	6084720	You're welcome.
6086720	6087720	The new Baldur's Gate?
6087720	6089720	Yeah, I've never played the Baldur's Gate, apparently.
6089720	6091720	Yeah, someone says it's cool, but apparently it's cool.
6093720	6094720	Delicious.
6094720	6096720	You played any RTS?
6097720	6098720	Starcraft?
6098720	6100720	No, my dad played it.
6101720	6103720	Age of Empires? No.
6103720	6105720	Civ 6 is a dumpster fire.
6105720	6107720	Is that actually?
6107720	6110720	Didn't they not announce there's a new Civ 6 border?
6110720	6112720	Yeah, a new Civ coming out.
6115720	6116720	Long toes.
6116720	6118720	Wait, they actually have long toes.
6118720	6120720	Stop. Do I have long toes?
6120720	6122720	There you go. I'm going to start again.
6122720	6123720	Hold on. I'm going to get that really right.
6123720	6124720	Hold on.
6125720	6126720	I don't know.
6126720	6128720	I feel like I have the toe...
6128720	6129720	Because you can have...
6129720	6131720	Some people have toes that...
6131720	6133720	Oh, wait. Sorry. You can't see any of them.
6133720	6134720	Hold on. Let's try it again.
6134720	6136720	Some people have toes where they are all the same size.
6136720	6138720	They are all the same length.
6138720	6140720	They come across like that.
6140720	6142720	Mainly the...
6142720	6144720	That shape?
6144720	6146720	I don't know if that makes any sense.
6146720	6147720	You feel cute.
6147720	6148720	Your toes are cute.
6148720	6151720	I'm going to start getting a complex about my freaking toes.
6151720	6153720	You don't...
6153720	6155720	Right. How long are my toes?
6155720	6157720	We'll do it in inches because you're all American.
6157720	6160720	You said 2.5 inches is...
6160720	6161720	Wait, hold on.
6161720	6164720	I'm trying to show you and do it at the same time.
6164720	6166720	Where is 2.5?
6169720	6171720	Where...
6171720	6172720	I am...
6172720	6176720	My index toe is just bigger than an inch.
6176720	6178720	Up there.
6178720	6180720	Sorry. I just hit the mic.
6180720	6181720	Oh, you're not American.
6181720	6182720	I'm sorry.
6182720	6184720	Hold on.
6184720	6185720	Okay.
6185720	6186720	Roughly...
6186720	6188720	3 centimeter toe.
6189720	6191720	I got 3 centimeter toe.
6191720	6192720	I am offended.
6192720	6194720	Long toe equals more than joy.
6194720	6196720	Well, fuck is an inch.
6197720	6199720	3 of these, baby.
6201720	6203720	Measure the entire foot.
6203720	6204720	Oh, no.
6204720	6206720	But then you will know that I've got big feet.
6206720	6207720	Oh, no.
6207720	6209720	My foot's bigger than the ruler.
6209720	6212720	If the ruler goes there, it's like way bigger.
6212720	6215720	If this ruler is 15 centimeters...
6215720	6216720	Wait, hold on.
6216720	6218720	Let me put it as a thing.
6219720	6221720	Okay. Put it on my heel.
6221720	6223720	And it's there on my toe.
6223720	6226720	So I'm like 16 centimeter feet.
6227720	6228720	Yeah.
6228720	6231720	Sorry. That was like the most known way to do it.
6231720	6233720	But I did it.
6234720	6235720	Big feet are good.
6235720	6237720	I'm glad you like them.
6237720	6239720	But you have not big feet.
6239720	6241720	The mic is low.
6241720	6242720	I don't know.
6242720	6243720	I might have...
6243720	6247720	I genuinely thought I was like average on everything.
6247720	6250720	But then when I did the sweet-eating cam,
6250720	6251720	and everyone saw my hands,
6251720	6252720	they were like,
6252720	6253720	oh, your hands are so small.
6253720	6255720	But when we started measuring it together,
6255720	6256720	I was like, oh, okay.
6259720	6261720	Imagine if this is popped right now,
6261720	6263720	because I'm a sweetie.
6266720	6270720	Can you measure how wide you can spread your big toe?
6270720	6271720	And the one next to...
6271720	6273720	Wait, how wide?
6274720	6276720	I don't know.
6276720	6278720	Like, because you could...
6278720	6279720	Like this?
6279720	6280720	Is that what you wanted?
6280720	6281720	Hold on.
6281720	6282720	Okay.
6283720	6285720	Thank you, Snowberry sweetie.
6288720	6289720	Like that?
6289720	6291720	Or do you mean like the actual width?
6291720	6292720	I don't know.
6292720	6293720	It depends.
6293720	6294720	It has to be malleable.
6295720	6297720	This is course measurement.
6297720	6299720	It has to be malleable.
6299720	6300720	Like it has to be...
6300720	6302720	Because I can grip stuff like...
6302720	6303720	Hold on.
6303720	6304720	Let me just...
6304720	6305720	Hold on.
6305720	6306720	Try moving it a little bit.
6306720	6307720	There you go.
6307720	6308720	There you go.
6308720	6309720	Just pop it there.
6309720	6310720	Good boy.
6310720	6311720	Tap.
6311720	6312720	Headpats.
6313720	6314720	This.
6314720	6315720	It depends,
6315720	6317720	because like that is...
6317720	6318720	You know.
6320720	6322720	I can put it in between my toes.
6329720	6330720	In the culture,
6330720	6332720	she would have nice grippers
6332720	6334720	down her renders and chat.
6334720	6335720	I guess your feet are small,
6335720	6336720	but it makes your toes
6336720	6337720	really long and compact.
6337720	6338720	No!
6338720	6339720	I'm going to get
6339720	6341720	a freaking complex after this dream.
6341720	6342720	I just thought my feet
6342720	6343720	were really normal.
6345720	6346720	Oh, my cat's meowing.
6346720	6347720	Did you hear him?
6349720	6350720	Do you want in?
6351720	6352720	Did you hear that?
6353720	6354720	Hold on.
6355720	6356720	Hold on.
6356720	6357720	Let me get him.
6358720	6359720	Baby boy.
6360720	6361720	You want in?
6362720	6363720	Baby boy.
6364720	6365720	Vigo.
6366720	6367720	Vigo.
6367720	6368720	You can't just...
6368720	6369720	Oh.
6369720	6370720	Gimli.
6370720	6371720	Gimli,
6371720	6372720	do you want to come on stream?
6374720	6376720	She's so confused right now.
6376720	6377720	She's like,
6377720	6378720	what are you doing?
6378720	6379720	Gimli, come here.
6380720	6381720	Gimli,
6381720	6383720	come right here.
6383720	6384720	Come right here.
6384720	6385720	Show the people
6385720	6386720	how adorable you are.
6386720	6388720	No, that's the wrong way.
6388720	6390720	Gimli, what's this?
6391720	6392720	Gimli.
6392720	6393720	Yes.
6393720	6394720	Yes.
6394720	6395720	Okay,
6395720	6396720	just gently don't knock
6396720	6397720	over the webcam
6397720	6398720	or I'll cry.
6398720	6399720	Gimli.
6399720	6400720	Don't knock over it.
6400720	6401720	Right.
6401720	6402720	Out.
6402720	6403720	Out.
6403720	6404720	You're going to knock over the webcam.
6404720	6405720	Gimli.
6405720	6406720	I'm sure.
6406720	6407720	I've only got 10 more minutes.
6407720	6408720	I'll be out in a minute, Gimli.
6409720	6410720	You can't go.
6411720	6412720	Give me 10 minutes,
6412720	6413720	Gimli.
6413720	6414720	Just 10 minutes is all I need.
6414720	6415720	Sorry.
6415720	6416720	My tree was sweet to hear that.
6418720	6419720	Mommy Gimli.
6420720	6421720	She was so going to knock over
6421720	6422720	that webcam,
6422720	6423720	so I was like,
6423720	6424720	get out, Gimli.
6424720	6425720	I can tell.
6425720	6426720	Oh.
6427720	6428720	Oh, I've done it now.
6428720	6429720	I haven't off.
6430720	6431720	Gimli, 10 minutes.
6432720	6433720	And I'm out.
6433720	6434720	Stop it.
6437720	6438720	Your dog is very cute.
6438720	6439720	Thank you.
6445720	6446720	I've been in...
6446720	6448720	I've certified for eight years
6448720	6449720	for your perfect.
6449720	6450720	Thank you.
6450720	6451720	Literally,
6451720	6452720	I shouldn't have brought her in
6452720	6453720	because now she's going to
6453720	6454720	want the attention.
6454720	6455720	And I was like,
6455720	6456720	I'm not finished.
6456720	6457720	I'm not finished.
6457720	6458720	Give me 10 minutes, girls.
6459720	6460720	10 minutes of getting
6460720	6461720	screamed at by a cat.
6461720	6462720	Literally,
6462720	6464720	a cat does not understand
6464720	6465720	the feed type.
6467720	6468720	She doesn't have a cat.
6468720	6469720	She has 10 doves.
6472720	6474720	And that was my Gimli.
6474720	6476720	I thought it was my baby boy,
6476720	6477720	Vigo.
6480720	6481720	Thank you very much.
6482720	6483720	Votams.
6483720	6485720	And thank you for Rono.
6485720	6487720	I appreciate the gifts
6487720	6488720	and membership.
6488720	6489720	I could...
6491720	6492720	Cats and the Feet.
6492720	6493720	Yes.
6493720	6494720	I picked up.
6494720	6495720	Thank you.
6495720	6496720	Caleb Harris as well.
6498720	6500720	I adopted Vigo
6500720	6501720	and Gimli.
6501720	6502720	And their starting situations
6502720	6503720	are actually really sad,
6503720	6505720	but it's a really happy ending.
6505720	6506720	So I
6507720	6508720	I messaged a shelter
6508720	6509720	and I was like,
6509720	6510720	hey,
6511720	6512720	I work from home.
6512720	6513720	I would love to
6513720	6514720	open up my home
6514720	6515720	to two cats
6515720	6516720	that cannot be separated.
6516720	6517720	If you didn't know
6517720	6518720	for adoption agencies
6518720	6519720	and all that kind of thing,
6519720	6520720	it's really hard
6520720	6522720	to be home doubles
6523720	6525720	that are inseparable.
6526720	6527720	So I messaged them
6527720	6528720	and they came back
6528720	6529720	and they were like,
6529720	6531720	we have these two ruffians.
6532720	6533720	They have come from
6533720	6534720	an hoarder's home,
6535720	6536720	which makes them un...
6537720	6538720	They cannot be
6538720	6539720	with any other animal,
6539720	6540720	but each other.
6542720	6543720	So I went
6543720	6544720	and visited them
6545720	6546720	and they were these
6546720	6547720	poor, scaredy cats.
6548720	6549720	They genuinely were
6549720	6550720	so terrified of any humans.
6552720	6553720	Thank you, yummy,
6553720	6554720	for the memba.
6555720	6556720	Thank you for just like
6556720	6557720	remembering as well
6557720	6558720	for the correct tier.
6558720	6559720	I do apologize
6559720	6560720	about messing up that tier.
6560720	6561720	Yes, they're a bonded pair
6561720	6562720	and they can't be separated.
6562720	6563720	But I just want to say
6563720	6564720	the universe works
6565720	6566720	in mysterious ways.
6566720	6567720	Sorry, I know I'm supposed
6567720	6568720	to be doing ASMR,
6568720	6569720	but I'm just trying
6569720	6570720	to call them right now
6570720	6571720	without the mic on the floor.
6572720	6573720	The world will work
6573720	6574720	in mysterious ways.
6574720	6575720	Now I do not believe
6575720	6576720	in supporting certain
6577720	6578720	cat breeds,
6578720	6579720	which are bad for their health.
6579720	6580720	An example of that
6580720	6582720	is the munchkin breed.
6583720	6585720	Vigo is mixed tabby
6586720	6587720	and munchkin breed.
6588720	6589720	The universe
6589720	6590720	will fight
6590720	6591720	and the universe
6591720	6592720	will find ways
6593720	6594720	to laugh in your face.
6595720	6596720	Because I am a big believer
6597720	6598720	and like completely
6598720	6599720	no longer breeding them
6600720	6601720	and not letting them
6601720	6602720	be a genetic line
6602720	6603720	any further
6603720	6604720	because it's so bad
6604720	6605720	for their health.
6606720	6607720	San Baroli,
6607720	6608720	thank you very much.
6609720	6610720	And then the universe
6610720	6611720	laughed in my face
6612720	6613720	and said,
6613720	6614720	guess what?
6614720	6615720	Your baby boy
6615720	6616720	is a half-foot
6616720	6617720	and I'm like,
6617720	6618720	okay.
6618720	6619720	Both of them,
6619720	6620720	thank you for the upgrade.
6621720	6622720	So yeah,
6622720	6623720	if you ever think
6624720	6625720	the universe doesn't
6625720	6626720	have a little joke for you,
6626720	6627720	oh, I assure you,
6627720	6628720	the universe is going to,
6629720	6630720	it's got a joke for you.
6631720	6632720	Yeah, like pugs,
6632720	6634720	yes, I am a bit of a
6634720	6635720	please don't support,
6636720	6637720	but this was just me,
6638720	6639720	like Scottish fold cats.
6640720	6641720	As adorable as they look,
6642720	6643720	absolutely not.
6643720	6644720	Hairless cats,
6644720	6645720	absolutely not.
6645720	6646720	A lot of people
6646720	6647720	will say,
6647720	6648720	but I can look after them.
6648720	6650720	It's not about you looking after them.
6650720	6652720	It's about the general population
6652720	6653720	looking after them.
6653720	6655720	Does the general population
6655720	6657720	going to do all these steps
6657720	6658720	about looking after their cat
6658720	6659720	and the hairless ones
6659720	6660720	getting out of bath
6660720	6661720	and removing the dirt cells
6661720	6662720	because it's not got
6662720	6663720	freaking fur?
6663720	6664720	No, it's not.
6664720	6665720	Think of the bigger picture.
6665720	6666720	It's selfish.
6666720	6667720	Anyway,
6667720	6669720	don't get me started
6669720	6671720	on animal breeding
6671720	6672720	because a lot of it
6672720	6674720	is just absolutely insane.
6674720	6675720	I'm waiting until you get started
6675720	6676720	and learn about
6676720	6678720	what pedigree dogs are.
6678720	6680720	Pedigree dogs are just certified.
6682720	6683720	You'll literally get a certificate
6683720	6684720	saying, yes, this dog
6684720	6685720	has been produced via
6685720	6687720	freaking insane amounts of
6687720	6688720	zest.
6688720	6689720	And it was like,
6689720	6691720	why is pedigree even a thing?
6691720	6692720	Get a mutt.
6692720	6693720	Muts are the healthiest kind of dog
6693720	6694720	you can even get.
6695720	6697720	Ah, and mixed breed cats,
6697720	6698720	they're the healthiest kind
6698720	6699720	you can get.
6699720	6700720	Don't support the little munchkins
6700720	6702720	that have freaking stilts for legs.
6702720	6704720	It's actually so freaking sad.
6704720	6705720	And a canny,
6705720	6706720	oh, oh, I could really start
6706720	6708720	fucking beating my back.
6708720	6710720	Right, can, can, can, can, can.
6710720	6711720	Anyway, yeah,
6711720	6712720	the universe will always
6712720	6713720	have a joke for you.
6716720	6717720	So, yeah,
6717720	6720720	I despise munchkins.
6720720	6721720	I don't,
6721720	6722720	for the, for the kindness
6722720	6723720	of the poor cat,
6723720	6724720	they shouldn't be a thing.
6724720	6725720	And then the universe said,
6725720	6726720	oh, by the way,
6726720	6727720	Vigo is a half mix
6727720	6729720	of Tabby and munchkin.
6729720	6730720	And yeah,
6730720	6732720	he has saucer eyeballs.
6732720	6733720	I should actually post
6733720	6734720	a picture of my baby
6735720	6736720	but yeah,
6736720	6738720	Vigo has saucer eyeballs.
6738720	6739720	He's so adorable.
6740720	6741720	And the universe won
6742720	6743720	after that.
6743720	6744720	Hey,
6744720	6745720	do you do rabble and
6745720	6746720	dress streams where you
6746720	6747720	just go down a bunch of
6747720	6748720	rabbit holes?
6748720	6749720	Oh, absolutely.
6750720	6751720	I did it in my
6751720	6752720	Skyrim one.
6752720	6753720	I started talking about
6753720	6754720	the needy streamer
6754720	6755720	overload ending
6755720	6756720	where she becomes a god
6757720	6758720	and starts a new
6758720	6759720	religion type thing
6759720	6760720	or like,
6760720	6761720	starts a new society.
6761720	6762720	And like,
6762720	6763720	I started talking
6763720	6764720	about conspiracy theories
6764720	6765720	and stuff,
6765720	6766720	but I don't like going too
6766720	6767720	deep into it
6767720	6768720	because I know it like
6768720	6769720	really just like
6769720	6770720	people didn't like it.
6770720	6771720	So I was like,
6771720	6772720	okay,
6772720	6773720	I will maybe do it too much
6773720	6774720	and so does me.
6774720	6775720	My mom used to read
6775720	6776720	Labrador's
6776720	6777720	but regarding cats,
6777720	6778720	McTess, yeah.
6779720	6781720	Vigo is just a small rock.
6781720	6782720	Every scrawny rage
6782720	6783720	makes me a lover
6783720	6784720	even more awe.
6784720	6785720	Vigo,
6785720	6786720	yeah,
6786720	6787720	Vigo,
6787720	6788720	my cat sings Vigo after
6788720	6789720	the guy,
6789720	6790720	did you know
6790720	6792720	and darted the rings
6792720	6793720	in the scene
6793720	6794720	where he kicks the helmet,
6794720	6796720	he was screaming for real.
6798720	6799720	Do you want to know
6799720	6800720	why he screamed out
6800720	6801720	for real like that?
6801720	6802720	Because
6802720	6803720	because he actually
6803720	6804720	booked his poop.
6804720	6805720	And yeah,
6805720	6806720	and yes,
6806720	6807720	did you name
6807720	6808720	your cats
6808720	6809720	after the Lord of the Rings?
6809720	6810720	Of course I named my cats
6810720	6811720	after the Lord of the Rings.
6811720	6812720	Well,
6812720	6813720	would I name them
6813720	6814720	freaking Bill and Ben,
6814720	6815720	the flower pot men?
6815720	6816720	No,
6816720	6817720	I wouldn't.
6818720	6819720	So yeah,
6819720	6820720	my baby boy,
6820720	6821720	my baby girl.
6821720	6822720	And yes,
6822720	6823720	I gave
6823720	6824720	Gimli,
6825720	6826720	well yeah,
6826720	6827720	I gave Gimli a boy's name
6827720	6828720	technically.
6828720	6829720	But Gimli's got
6829720	6830720	ginger on her butt.
6830720	6831720	So,
6831720	6832720	Gimli,
6832720	6833720	my homie now.
6833720	6834720	Yeah,
6834720	6835720	yeah,
6835720	6836720	name them,
6836720	6837720	Bill and Ben,
6837720	6838720	the flower pot men,
6838720	6839720	honestly.
6840720	6841720	Holy crap,
6841720	6842720	you just maybe remember
6842720	6843720	Bill and Ben.
6843720	6844720	I remember Bill and Ben.
6845720	6846720	JJ,
6846720	6847720	you've got a picture of me.
6848720	6849720	Thank you for the membership,
6849720	6850720	JJ.
6850720	6851720	I appreciate it.
6852720	6853720	Just for all members
6853720	6854720	who are watching,
6855720	6856720	the membership stream
6856720	6857720	start next week,
6857720	6858720	but I promise you,
6858720	6859720	I will throw you into
6859720	6860720	the thick of it
6861720	6862720	and we'll
6862720	6863720	have a lot of fun from there.
6864720	6865720	We'll take it from there
6866720	6867720	because this week
6867720	6868720	is kind of locked
6868720	6869720	in a little bit.
6869720	6870720	We do have a collab
6870720	6871720	again
6871720	6872720	with me
6872720	6873720	and all my girls.
6874720	6875720	You are
6875720	6876720	an adorable girl.
6876720	6877720	We love it.
6880720	6881720	Yes.
6881720	6882720	What's next?
6882720	6883720	Was it a gym?
6883720	6884720	Cute.
6884720	6885720	Yeah,
6885720	6886720	I'm not going to get
6886720	6887720	any more
6887720	6888720	putters
6888720	6889720	after Vigo
6889720	6890720	and
6890720	6891720	Gimli.
6891720	6892720	I think
6893720	6894720	I will probably
6894720	6895720	have the biggest
6895720	6896720	mental breakdown
6896720	6897720	of my life
6898720	6899720	once they pass.
6899720	6900720	Thankfully,
6900720	6901720	I have them very young.
6901720	6902720	They,
6902720	6903720	I think they're
6903720	6904720	three years old.
6905720	6906720	Unfortunately,
6906720	6907720	due to the hoarder situation,
6907720	6908720	they actually don't know
6908720	6909720	what age
6909720	6910720	my baby boy and baby girl are.
6911720	6912720	Like,
6912720	6913720	I was trying to get
6913720	6914720	as much information
6914720	6915720	that they had,
6915720	6916720	but they were just very honest
6916720	6917720	and said,
6917720	6918720	like, look,
6918720	6919720	we don't,
6919720	6920720	we don't actually
6920720	6921720	have information
6921720	6922720	on these babies.
6924720	6925720	Strani,
6925720	6926720	do you know
6926720	6927720	if you get a cut
6927720	6928720	of YouTube Premium membership
6928720	6929720	watchers?
6929720	6930720	I absolutely do.
6931720	6933720	If you pay for YouTube,
6933720	6934720	oh, it used to be called
6934720	6935720	YouTube Red,
6935720	6936720	but if you do
6936720	6937720	YouTube Premium,
6939720	6940720	forever,
6940720	6942720	however long you watch it,
6942720	6943720	like, I get a percentage.
6943720	6945720	So say you 100%
6945720	6946720	watched me.
6946720	6947720	I get 100%
6947720	6948720	of what you
6948720	6949720	generate
6949720	6950720	for content creators.
6950720	6951720	Does that make sense?
6951720	6952720	It's the only percentage
6952720	6954720	base to the best they can.
6956720	6957720	I've noticed my
6957720	6958720	favorite troopers dabble
6958720	6959720	in theories.
6959720	6960720	Must be one of those jokes
6960720	6961720	from the universe.
6961720	6962720	Honestly, the universe
6962720	6963720	is a little funny joke for you.
6963720	6964720	Like, please,
6964720	6966720	if you're ever, like,
6966720	6967720	thinking,
6967720	6968720	oh, there's nothing
6968720	6969720	interesting's gonna happen
6969720	6970720	in my life,
6970720	6971720	I assure you,
6971720	6972720	the universe is cooking something.
6972720	6973720	Because I,
6973720	6975720	I am the biggest,
6975720	6976720	like,
6976720	6977720	don't support,
6977720	6978720	like,
6978720	6979720	pugs,
6979720	6980720	don't support
6980720	6981720	French Bulldogs,
6981720	6982720	like,
6982720	6983720	don't support
6983720	6984720	munchkin cats,
6984720	6985720	don't do this or that.
6985720	6986720	And then the universe goes,
6986720	6987720	oh, by the way,
6987720	6988720	here's a half munchkin.
6988720	6989720	I'm like,
6989720	6990720	oh, okay,
6990720	6991720	I see how it is.
6992720	6993720	This squishy thing
6993720	6994720	is kind of hypnotic.
6994720	6995720	Yeah, you can, like,
6995720	6997720	see the balls move around in it.
6997720	6998720	It's just quite nice.
6998720	6999720	I quite like it.
7004720	7005720	It's, like,
7005720	7006720	really therapeutic
7006720	7007720	to, like,
7007720	7008720	squish down into it,
7008720	7009720	honestly.
7010720	7011720	I'm not being,
7011720	7012720	like, I genuinely
7012720	7013720	wholeheartedly mean it.
7013720	7014720	Like, it feels very nice
7014720	7015720	to, like, squish something
7015720	7016720	under my feet.
7018720	7019720	Got to go.
7019720	7020720	Have fun with the rest
7020720	7021720	of the game.
7021720	7022720	Congratulations.
7022720	7023720	Thank you.
7023720	7024720	Yes, please don't worry.
7024720	7025720	Can you go?
7025720	7026720	I'm going to redirect
7026720	7027720	into the sheebie.
7028720	7029720	Actually,
7029720	7030720	is she up right now?
7032720	7033720	Hold on.
7033720	7034720	I'm leaning over.
7036720	7038720	She's live right now
7038720	7040720	with another crab's treasure.
7040720	7041720	Oh, yeah.
7041720	7042720	Apparently,
7042720	7044720	the music in that game
7044720	7045720	is, like, so good.
7045720	7046720	But it's a Dark Souls crab.
7046720	7047720	I thought it was, like,
7047720	7048720	a fun little crab game.
7048720	7049720	I was going to play it
7049720	7050720	and someone said it was, like,
7050720	7051720	it's like Dark Souls
7051720	7052720	and I'm like, bro,
7052720	7053720	if I can't,
7053720	7054720	if I can't tag in
7054720	7055720	the reflins to help me,
7055720	7056720	then that game,
7056720	7057720	there's a fight.
7059720	7061720	I will most likely do
7061720	7064720	a Talking Stream membership
7064720	7066720	one for next week,
7066720	7067720	just because there's
7067720	7070720	so many marshmallows
7070720	7072720	I can't really say,
7072720	7073720	but we can see
7073720	7074720	in another time.
7076720	7077720	But yeah,
7077720	7078720	I hope you enjoy this
7078720	7080720	role-play, role-play,
7080720	7081720	it's not even role-play.
7081720	7082720	Literally, it wasn't even
7082720	7083720	ASMR.
7083720	7084720	I'm talking to you
7084720	7085720	at normal levels.
7085720	7086720	I normally do it for streams,
7086720	7088720	so it's all fake.
7091720	7093720	It's a Souls crab game,
7093720	7094720	honestly.
7094720	7095720	Adjust the ears, boy.
7095720	7096720	Thanks for the stream, Sonny.
7096720	7098720	It's what's Sonny.
7098720	7099720	Strawny.
7099720	7100720	Thank you, not Alessandro,
7100720	7101720	for the two.
7101720	7102720	I appreciate it.
7102720	7103720	I really hope
7103720	7104720	I've managed to say
7104720	7105720	everyone's names.
7105720	7106720	Thank you so much
7106720	7107720	for your patience as well
7107720	7108720	as I completely messed
7108720	7109720	that stream up
7109720	7111720	and wholeheartedly
7111720	7112720	just, like,
7112720	7113720	yapping in tone.
7113720	7115720	That's all we're doing here.
7117720	7118720	Best stream I had
7118720	7119720	feet and a kitty.
7119720	7120720	What more could I ask for?
7120720	7122720	Yeah, that was gimme.
7122720	7123720	Love this.
7123720	7124720	Thank you, Strawny.
7124720	7125720	Thank you, my stream.
7125720	7126720	Thank you so much, yes.
7126720	7127720	I will go now,
7127720	7128720	but thank you so much
7128720	7129720	to everyone who
7129720	7131720	membershiped
7131720	7132720	and gifted
7132720	7134720	and download, etc.
7134720	7135720	The membership streams
7135720	7136720	start next week
7136720	7137720	because this week's schedule
7137720	7138720	had already kind of been
7138720	7139720	locked in
7139720	7140720	and I didn't actually know
7140720	7141720	what I was going to do
7141720	7142720	with the monetization.
7142720	7144720	Thank you, Dufus.
7144720	7145720	Dufedoff
7145720	7148720	for the member.
7148720	7149720	And again,
7149720	7150720	if you can't membership,
7150720	7152720	please do not worry.
7152720	7153720	I always have
7153720	7154720	free streams coming.
7154720	7155720	I always have free content
7155720	7156720	coming out.
7156720	7157720	You just need to
7157720	7158720	give me a little patience.
7158720	7159720	But the dust
7159720	7160720	is definitely starting
7160720	7163720	to settle from debut,
7163720	7164720	which means I can, like,
7164720	7165720	fully focus on
7165720	7166720	everything I want to do.
7166720	7167720	Legs!
7167720	7168720	Thank you for the five gifts.
7168720	7169720	I appreciate it.
7169720	7170720	Congrats on those
7170720	7171720	who caught it
7171720	7172720	with your face.
7172720	7173720	And all the music.
7173720	7174720	Thank you very much.
7174720	7175720	That was very kind of you.
7175720	7176720	But yes, the dust
7176720	7177720	is starting to settle,
7177720	7178720	which is good
7178720	7179720	because it means
7179720	7180720	I can start focusing
7180720	7181720	on the free content
7181720	7182720	I want to do
7182720	7183720	and all the stuff
7183720	7184720	I want to
7184720	7185720	think about.
7185720	7186720	But yes,
7186720	7187720	please say hi to Shipee
7187720	7188720	for me.
7188720	7189720	I will type a few
7189720	7190720	messages in her chat
7190720	7191720	and then I am going
7191720	7192720	to go soak
7192720	7193720	this little tub
7193720	7194720	and see what happens.
7194720	7195720	Yeah,
7195720	7196720	my purr tub
7196720	7197720	isn't doing
7197720	7198720	so good.
7198720	7199720	But we'll see.
7199720	7200720	We'll see.
7200720	7201720	Okay.
7201720	7202720	Right.
7202720	7203720	Bye-bye for now,
7203720	7204720	reeflings.
7204720	7205720	I would do
7205720	7206720	my little kissy,
7206720	7207720	but this is the
7207720	7208720	microphone.
7208720	7209720	Can I kiss you
7209720	7210720	with my tub?
7210720	7211720	Right.
7211720	7212720	This is
7212720	7213720	my kisses.
7213720	7214720	Mmm.
7214720	7215720	Mmm.
7215720	7216720	Mmm.
7216720	7217720	Mmm.
7217720	7218720	Mmm.
7218720	7219720	Mmm.
7219720	7220720	Mmm.
7220720	7221720	Mmm.
7221720	7222720	Mmm.
7222720	7223720	Mmm.
7223720	7224720	Bye-bye, reeflings.
7224720	7225720	Bye-bye.
7225720	7226720	Look,
7226720	7227720	I'm waving you goodbye.
7227720	7228720	Bye-bye.
7228720	7229720	Oh,
7229720	7230720	this is like really hard
7230720	7231720	and like doing on an axis here.
7231720	7232720	Bye-bye.
7232720	7233720	Actually,
7233720	7234720	I can shake this
7234720	7235720	foot really fast.
7235720	7236720	Bye-bye.
7236720	7237720	Okay.
7237720	7238720	Bye-bye, reeflings.
7238720	7239720	I'm going to
7239720	7240720	say hi to Shipee.
7240720	7241720	Okay.
7241720	7242720	Bye-bye.
7242720	7243720	reeflings.
7243720	7244720	Be good.
7244720	7245720	Bye-bye.
