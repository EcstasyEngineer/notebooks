00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,820
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

3
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,720
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

4
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,640
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

5
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,220
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

6
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:16,400
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little of

7
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I feel like I'm moving five miles an hour.

8
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm so tired.

9
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
How are you?

10
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm not...

11
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm not gonna lie to you.

12
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,400
At exactly four o'clock, I woke up from a nap,

13
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
walked over to my computer,

14
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,400
and pressed go live.

15
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,400
So I'm still waking up.

16
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm waking up to ash and dust.

17
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Okay.

18
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Might be a little bit delirious.

19
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Got my tea.

20
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Ready to rumble.

21
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,400
I gotta remember who I am.

22
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,400
I also got an iPad stand.

23
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Thank you for your support,

24
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
those who look at my throne and such.

25
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
And I was trying to set it up

26
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
so that I could use my iPad

27
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
almost like a third monitor and look at chat.

28
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
And it was working well,

29
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,400
except I could see it was so tiny

30
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
that I couldn't see anything.

31
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
And I'm like, oh, I'll have to lean forward

32
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
and squint my eyes to see what the frick I'm looking at.

33
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Ugh.

34
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
What are you guys doing today?

35
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
How was...

36
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Did you get double ASMR again

37
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:01,400
from Shtrone and Anise?

38
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
By the way,

39
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,400
is she be short for Shabilla?

40
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm too tired to come up with a snarky remark to that.

41
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Oh, no, I see the Tomb Raider.

42
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
I don't know where I am.

43
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
I've got two milk model kids.

44
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Go.

45
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Sick, but you're here.

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
I like...

47
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Some of you guys might have saw me

48
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I went to the doctors this morning

49
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,400
and like going out into the world

50
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,400
takes a lot out of me and interacting with people

51
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
because I kept getting turned around.

52
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Like I kept accidentally going the wrong way

53
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
because my GPS was messing stuff up.

54
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
I was a little bit late

55
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
and then the office was taken forever.

56
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
And so I was just so tired

57
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
when I got home,

58
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
but then I had to do a bunch of other stuff

59
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
to prepare for stream.

60
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
And then like exactly 3.30,

61
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I just fell asleep on the couch

62
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,400
and knocked out.

63
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
But we're here.

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
We are here.

65
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
She be being lost is kind of me.

66
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
I have no sense of direction.

67
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I never know where I am.

68
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Even in my town,

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
in my city that I've lived in

70
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
for my entire life, essentially,

71
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm like, oh, which road do I take?

72
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Where am I?

73
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
It's not a miracle I'm awake right now.

74
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
I did set an alarm,

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
but I'm like,

76
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
I know I needed to just like lay down for a bit

77
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
and just gain my bearings.

78
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
But I hope you guys enjoyed Tomb Raider

79
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,400
with Icy and then ASMR with Momay.

80
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,400
I am quite eepy.

81
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
I am waking up.

82
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Don't worry, I'll wake up though.

83
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm just like here.

84
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
I didn't fall asleep till like 3 a.m.

85
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
My whole sleep schedule is messed up

86
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,400
ever since I streamed so late.

87
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Oh, a womb raider?

88
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Oh my God.

89
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
I already made that joke.

90
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
I made the Ash and Dust joke.

91
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
The Imagine Dragons.

92
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Oh, you like Imagine Dragons?

93
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Well, imagine me dragging these nuts

94
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
across your face.

95
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Got him.

96
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
I forget to put my ooloo mouth on.

97
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
I'm pretty good.

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I'm pretty, I'm pretty, I'm pretty, uh,

100
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm as, I'm as smart as a whip

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
that doesn't make any sense.

102
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
But yeah, I have no idea what this game is about.

103
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Um, I know like it might be a visual novel.

104
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I went in for like a second

105
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
and I saw that it was voice acted.

106
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
So I turned off the voices.

107
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
I'll be voice at voicing.

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
See the characters today.

109
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
And you guys can vote in the voices.

110
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
It's about bunny girls.

111
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Yeah.

112
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Like I haven't watched any gameplay.

113
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Haven't read anything about it.

114
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I know it was a flavor of the month game

115
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
for a very, for a little bit.

116
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I'm like, okay, I'll play it.

117
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Um, so we'll see.

118
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
We'll see.

119
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Yawns and finds.

120
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
I'm surrounded by bunny girls.

121
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
I see this as an absolute win.

122
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Okay.

123
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm going to love it.

124
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I also went in just in case

125
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
because like when I went to purchase the game

126
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,400
I was like, oh wait, I hope there's not like surprise

127
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
things that need to be censored.

128
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
So I went in and I double checked

129
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
because I didn't know if it was going to be like a Hoonipop situation.

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,400
You guys are all just like tricking me

131
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
and the whole world is against me tricking me.

132
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Pretending that stuff is normal.

133
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
And then it's a crazy messed up game.

134
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Um, yeah.

135
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
So I went in.

136
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
There wasn't any of that.

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I was like, okay.

138
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Although I did see like when I was looking at the steam page

139
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,400
for like a brief second when I was purchasing the game

140
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,400
just like people's screenshots

141
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
and they're all Ponzu shots.

142
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,400
So I'm like, what am I getting into?

143
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Whoo.

144
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Kushi jokes scare.

145
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Exactly.

146
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,400
She doesn't know about the level that just opens.

147
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
What?

148
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Excuse me.

149
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
It's just a lot of fan service.

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
It's on brand for me.

151
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,400
What color today?

152
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
What the fuck does that mean?

153
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I'm white.

154
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I did tease a possible brown toggle.

155
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
It's death less messed up than class of 09.

156
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,400
I didn't expect it to be messed up as much as class of 09.

157
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Panty simulator with a side of alcohol.

158
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,400
You think they meant my ponzu?

159
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I don't even remember.

160
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Um, actually these are one of my favorite pairs.

161
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:36,400
It's like pastel rainbow-y lace with flowers on it.

162
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:44,400
And it's a thong.

163
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
And it's like has a lot of light blue.

164
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
It's nice to get my skin tone.

165
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Anyways, usually we're nothing,

166
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
but I had to go out into the world today.

167
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,400
So I decided to, you know, bundle up before going on an excursion.

168
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
I actually fucking hate thongs.

169
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I don't even know why I have so many, so many, so many.

170
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I need to buy more underwear, like some like cheekies.

171
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:22,400
I accidentally, so like I, I'm a huge fan of like the Savage X Fenty,

172
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
like Rihanna's lingerie line.

173
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:32,400
And I forgot to fucking cancel my membership because they charge $59 a month for membership.

174
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
And you can skip the month, mind you.

175
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,400
And you can like save the money, but I swear to you, I thought I skipped the month.

176
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,400
And they charge me 60 bucks and I have to spend it on something.

177
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
And I'm like, well, it looks like I'm getting panties.

178
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Looks like I'm getting panties.

179
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,400
They have great stuff, but I'm like, what the hell?

180
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,400
You know, I'm like, what the, what the actual fuck?

181
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
It's really high quality.

182
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
It's mostly what I wear.

183
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Although I go to the pink store sometimes for a little something, something.

184
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
It's been 10 minutes and we're talking about pansos.

185
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Yeah.

186
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
What did you expect?

187
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Are you new here?

188
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Wait a minute.

189
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Who are you?

190
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,400
What does she be?

191
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
It's funny.

192
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,400
You guys have got me saying, erm, what the sigma and erm, what the scallop?

193
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I, cause like when I, when my stream just wasn't loading, when I pressed start, I was like, erm,

194
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
what the, what the scallop?

195
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Scallop.

196
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,400
And then I just like, audibly sighed out loud when I, when I heard what I said.

197
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I'd be disappointed if people weren't still talking about random, at this point.

198
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Random what?

199
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,400
You be, it's she be, it's me, it's she be.

200
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Let's go and, yep.

201
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I should put disclaimer.

202
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
I'm tired of shit.

203
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
I promise you I'm not drunk.

204
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
I'm just tired.

205
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Usually like, listen, I made a big sacrifice streaming at the time that I do because around

206
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,400
this time is normally my nap time.

207
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
My family is notorious for napping.

208
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
My mom's the only one that can't.

209
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,400
My whole dad's side of the family are napping champions.

210
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:42,400
And from four to five, 30 prime nap time, something, I've like napped for like four hours before

211
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
and I still managed to get to sleep.

212
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Is it depression?

213
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I don't know.

214
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Maybe she's born with it.

215
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Maybe it's dysthymia.

216
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
She be, did you hear a Twitter room of the likes you can see?

217
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I can still see everybody's likes because I have not updated my Twitter on my phone.

218
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
So you can't hide from me.

219
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I know your secrets.

220
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I know when you're awake.

221
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I know when you've been bad or good.

222
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
So be bad.

223
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:20,400
For goodness sake.

224
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,400
What is your favorite kind of vegetable?

225
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Is a potato a vegetable?

226
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I really like potatoes.

227
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Yeah, potatoes are vegetable.

228
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Yeah, because it doesn't have like a seed.

229
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
I was like the dumbest thing I've ever said.

230
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Is a potato a vegetable?

231
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Oh my God.

232
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,400
It's funny because like technically zucchini is fruit.

233
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Tomatoes are fruit.

234
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Carrots are vegetable and like leafy greens are vegetables.

235
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,400
I really like all vegetables.

236
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I'm like trying to think of a vegetable I don't like.

237
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Like because I'll just eat anything.

238
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I don't like, like, I like, I'm not a huge fan of arugula but I also eat it.

239
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
I really like spinach.

240
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Yep.

241
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
I like Brussels sprouts.

242
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Did you know they've actually engineered the bad flavor out of Brussels sprouts now?

243
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
My dad used to hate Brussels sprouts.

244
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,400
And then he like threw some in the air fryer and like with a little bit of oil, salt and pepper.

245
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,400
And they were like really tasty, nutty, almost like an artichoke heart.

246
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
And he's like, this is not like what they taste like back then.

247
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,400
And then we looked it up and did research and they actually engineered the shit out of there.

248
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
You hate bell peppers?

249
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,400
I love bell peppers.

250
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Tomatoes are both vegetables and fruit.

251
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Depends on which taxonomy you're using.

252
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
All right.

253
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,400
I don't know what that means, but Godspeed.

254
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Listen, it smells so strong.

255
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Yeah, they do still smell like, you know, the devil's asshole, but it is.

256
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Spinach over lettuce for sale.

257
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
It's 100%.

258
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,400
I like butter lettuce because it's similar to spinach.

259
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Or I'll use like butter lettuce for like a lettuce wrap.

260
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Pretty good.

261
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Why the fuck are we talking about vegetables?

262
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,400
You know how much, like, this is how, this is what I mean.

263
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Somebody asked me a question.

264
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm like, all right.

265
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Talks 10 minutes explaining my answers.

266
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
But her lettuce, I barely know.

267
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Shut up.

268
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Get out of here.

269
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I think canned steamed veggies turn people off.

270
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Flavors are much better.

271
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Baked in oil.

272
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Oh yeah, I agree with that.

273
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I prefer, I'll eat steamed veggies because I like, I like steamed broccoli.

274
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
You're green beans.

275
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I love green beans.

276
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
The best lounge chat.

277
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Yeah.

278
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Yeah, but be cotton bum.

279
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
That's a me.

280
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Favorite breakfast.

281
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,400
You know, I love French toast.

282
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:11,400
French toast, I think was the first thing I learned how to cook after like learning how to like boil water and like make eggs.

283
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
I learned how to make French toast.

284
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
My mom taught me how to make French toast.

285
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,400
And it was so fun, that experience.

286
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,400
I burned everything, but you know, you live and you learn.

287
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
But yeah, I love, I love French toast.

288
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,400
I love the French toast, especially if it's Texas toast.

289
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I don't know.

290
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:43,400
I'm speaking in a very poor French accent because I'm half asleep, but I am.

291
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
It is how it is.

292
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,400
No, I didn't, I can boil water.

293
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Guys, I'm a very good cook.

294
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,400
When you're a kid and you're learning, you're not a very good cook.

295
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
It's called eggy bread in England.

296
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
That's fucking weird.

297
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
It's not a better name.

298
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
No, I don't like it.

299
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Don't ask to doubt.

300
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:20,400
If you've looked at my all account, people have commended me on my cooking skills because I've sent, I've taken pictures and posted some food I have cooked.

301
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,400
French toast is called lost bread and friend.

302
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,400
I feel like there's a pun in there.

303
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,400
I just found out the healthy frozen protein waffles taste and smell like the Ben and Jerry's waffle cones.

304
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Oh, okay.

305
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
But what brand?

306
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
I do love waffles though.

307
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,400
I used to fucking live off of, um, my mom said I used to love French toast sticks and ego waffles.

308
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:54,400
And then out of nostalgia the other day, I bought some ego waffles, but I don't have any syrup or butter.

309
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,400
So mistakes were made.

310
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Waffles versus pancakes.

311
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I prefer waffles.

312
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Like I love, I really like pancakes, but like sometimes pancakes would be a bit too mushy for me.

313
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:15,400
And I like the, I prefer the texture of a waffle over a pancake and that like a waffle can hold syrup better.

314
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Whereas a pancake, um, just becomes kind of just like soppy.

315
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
I've read French toast sticks.

316
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
It's pretty much just like French toast.

317
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,400
And you throw it in a toaster and you toast it in there.

318
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Or like a confectionary confection oven or an oven.

319
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
My Belgian side tell me waffles.

320
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Raw talking echoes.

321
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I have done that before, but I prefer like I, I, I'm weird and I prefer to eat waffles with my hands.

322
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Like my mom, uh, for some odd reason, because it's not like I was going to impress anybody or have a luncheon with the queen.

323
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:04,400
But she drilled etiquette in like proper, like using silverware into me.

324
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Um, like which forks and knives to use, which like if you're at this sort of event, what this means and what that means.

325
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Um, I think she just wanted me to be like proper, which isn't like a bad thing.

326
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Like teaching me, you know, your child etiquette and being, you know, behaved at the dinner table.

327
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Cause I was like, I remember, um, I would always have to say, like, can I be excused before I left the dinner table?

328
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,400
And I had, you know, all that stuff.

329
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,400
And so I remember like one parent when I was over somebody's house, I would just like, can I be excused?

330
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
And they're like, why are you asking?

331
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
And I'm like, cause I always have to ask.

332
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Yeah.

333
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Yeah.

334
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Manors maketh.

335
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
She beat.

336
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
It's funny.

337
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,400
I was literally, I don't know why it popped in my head on the toilet, but I was randomly just sitting there.

338
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm just like, manners maketh the man.

339
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
I didn't even watch Kingsman reach recently.

340
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Actually, that's a lie.

341
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
I watched the Kingsman.

342
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I didn't finish it because it was boring.

343
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,400
I got to the part past Rasputin.

344
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Rasputin.

345
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Poutine.

346
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Rasputin now.

347
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,400
And I was like, all right, this is kind of weird.

348
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
And it's kind of boring.

349
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,400
I prefer the first Kingsman movies moving on.

350
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
And then I fell asleep.

351
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,400
And then I just never bothered to watch it again.

352
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,400
She'd be getting mad at her friend's house because they served over the wrong shoulder.

353
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,400
No, like, I don't even recall like a lot of that stuff anymore.

354
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,400
I remember I went to like a fancy restaurant with my parents.

355
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,400
And this is the type of restaurant where if you get crumbs on the table,

356
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:49,400
they come over and they have a little thing to take the crumbs off and they move them away.

357
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
And they have like the multiple silverware.

358
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,400
And it's like, that's like, my parents usually go there for their anniversary because it's a very like pricey place.

359
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,400
And I've been like sitting there and I'm like, fuck, which fork do I use for salad again?

360
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I don't even, my mom's like that one.

361
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
And I'm like, oh, thanks.

362
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Anyways.

363
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:33,400
I love doing that and just dance.

364
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
It's like probably my favorite song to do in just dance.

365
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Besides, I think was I like that by Richard.

366
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Hold on.

367
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I like that just dance by the talk by the elect.

368
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Was it the toxic revenge or what the fuck toxic Avenger?

369
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Am I tripping?

370
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:21,400
I could have sworn I like that by toxic Avenger was in just dance.

371
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:33,400
I'm getting as toxic from Britney Spears.

372
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
I'm very frustrated.

373
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Whatever.

374
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm experiencing a Mandela effect for a moment.

375
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,400
It's going to beat Saber.

376
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,400
I definitely want to like if when they get a 3D model, 100% want to do just dance.

377
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I'm like, I need to get back into like dance and shape.

378
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
I'm just like a miss.

379
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I'm just atrophying in my chair.

380
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
I think you had a cool dream.

381
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Toxic Avenger is a movie.

382
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
No.

383
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
I think your thumbnail got restricted.

384
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Are you fucking serious?

385
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,400
You know, I noticed that when I was on my iPad, I was just like, wait a second.

386
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Why is it like grayed out?

387
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Like, was that like the three dots thing?

388
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,400
I didn't know what that meant, though, but that makes a lot more sense then.

389
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I'll fix it later.

390
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I blame my manager.

391
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,400
They approve the thumbnail.

392
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Throw some boobs in the thumbnail.

393
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Put some boobs in the thumbnail, bitch.

394
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Put some boobs.

395
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Check out Azura's cover of boobs in the thumbnail.

396
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
I thought it was lag.

397
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
I thought the gray was an artistic choice.

398
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,400
It's gray in the homepage.

399
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Just more reminders that I'm probably never going to be monetized.

400
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Sometimes I fall asleep and I hear my BGM in my ears.

401
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:32,400
I can't tell if I like it or not.

402
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Wake up.

403
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
I need a non-outfit.

404
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,400
I was thinking about adding one of those to throw in one of those VTuber outfits that

405
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I've been using for streams and stuff.

406
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
I have to get rid of this VOD based on what happened with other streamers.

407
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Why?

408
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
What happened to their VODs?

409
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Wait, I thought everyone got monetized and said, no, that's not true.

410
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,400
We applied for monetization all at the same time.

411
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,400
The majority of the other girls got it.

412
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm still under review.

413
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:15,400
I'm mentally preparing myself to be disappointed in case it happens.

414
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Serenity!

415
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Manchibi would go so hard.

416
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Does she know?

417
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Do they know?

418
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,400
There was a priestess and a nun and another iteration.

419
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Sorry, don't you usually stream around this time?

420
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,400
What are you doing, girl?

421
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Serenity, I made you an call of the lamb and you tried to kill me.

422
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
What was it?

423
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,400
You tried spreading falsehoods about my cult, so I had to throw you in prison.

424
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
So you're currently in prison right now and call of the lamb.

425
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,400
I'm so sorry.

426
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
VOD before streaming even started.

427
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
What do you mean?

428
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
YouTube said no to bunny garden?

429
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Explain.

430
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Is there anything you can do?

431
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,400
I can reapply in a month.

432
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
That's where I belong in prison.

433
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm getting lazy.

434
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Yeah, it would just be a month of I'd have to reapply.

435
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Do I have a hat?

436
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
No.

437
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
What?

438
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
What's that?

439
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
A hat?

440
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
A crazy, funky, junky hat?

441
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Ever slept?

442
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Hair and tidy?

443
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Oh, she looks like here at nightly.

444
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
We've been there.

445
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
We've done that.

446
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,400
We see right through your funky hat.

447
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Do you know where that's from?

448
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,400
I should be fine as long as you skip over the in-game ASMR.

449
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Really?

450
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Why don't I have a hat?

451
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Was that from Hannah Montana?

452
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Close.

453
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:01,400
It's from another show around that time.

454
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Why did we go show ago?

455
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Does that mean you're definitely not going to get me?

456
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Guys, I have no idea.

457
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
I have no idea.

458
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Maybe the YouTube coon will smile upon me and bless me with monetization.

459
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
But who knows?

460
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
If not, it is what it is.

461
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,400
You can always support me on Patreon even if you don't want to consume the content.

462
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Or you can always support me through stream loads.

463
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Or you can check out my merch.

464
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,400
It is not the end of the world.

465
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Wizards of Waverly Place, you got it!

466
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
I need a do-in-your-mom hat.

467
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
That's pretty good.

468
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
That's pretty good.

469
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
I would actually probably get that.

470
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Somebody said, uh,

471
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Man, I love fishing hat.

472
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I'm not worried about...

473
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
She likes to yap just as much as me.

474
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Like mother like daughter.

475
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Donate my imaginary memory.

476
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
I'd be like, alright.

477
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Pay your tithes every month.

478
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,400
And just pretend your name is green.

479
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
No member strips.

480
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Memberships.

481
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Membership streams though.

482
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Um, well, yeah, I'm not...

483
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
I'm not too worried.

484
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
I'm kind of just like dooming about it.

485
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Just like mentally.

486
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Because you know, what is that thing that like Wednesday Adam says?

487
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,400
If you expect the worst, you can't be disappointed or some shit.

488
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
But like, yeah.

489
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Member strips.

490
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Member strips is where you get chicken strips sent to you once a month in the mail.

491
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,400
And the box that they come in has my face stamped at them.

492
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:55,400
But it's like, you know that one gif of like a chicken pole dancing?

493
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Or it's like a rabbit?

494
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I don't know.

495
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Just pretend it's a chicken.

496
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
So it's a chicken pole dancing.

497
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
And that's like the way my face is on the chicken.

498
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,400
And then you get chicken strips from Sheebie.

499
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
That's chicken member strips.

500
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Yep.

501
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
They good.

502
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
They're the best.

503
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Nothing.

504
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Nothing but the best for my baby girls.

505
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Thank you.

506
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Thank you, Harilit.

507
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Full de tans.

508
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Full de tans.

509
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Full de tans.

510
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Thank you.

511
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
It didn't pop up because I had muted my desktop audio.

512
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
I forgot to turn it back on.

513
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,400
But thank you, Harilit.

514
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,400
But don't, yeah, don't worry about me.

515
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,400
It's mostly frustrating because I had like, I want to do like the membership streams that

516
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I have in mind.

517
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,400
My face, no, my face isn't on the strips.

518
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:58,400
It's on the box that holds the strips, unless you would prefer both.

519
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
We might do that.

520
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Ow.

521
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,400
I just like hit myself with a nipple really hard.

522
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Excuse me.

523
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,400
That was a sleepy burp.

524
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,400
All right.

525
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Go, ABGM.

526
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
It's time to play.

527
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Bup, bup, bup, bup.

528
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Body Gordon.

529
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.

530
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Where the fuck is it?

531
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Can I kiss the boo boo to help?

532
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:47,400
You know, can I be, can I be, can I be TMI for a second?

533
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
So mine are pierced.

534
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,400
And so sometimes I just get like hooked on stuff.

535
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Or I'm just like bump into something.

536
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:07,400
And that's like the worst thing.

537
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
I don't know.

538
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
No, no, I'm not ripping them.

539
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:18,400
They're not, my nipples aren't getting ripped off guys.

540
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:33,400
It's more, it's like imagine, like, if it, like, you know, I don't know if it's like this at all because I don't have balls, but imagine you're going to zip up your pants and like a little bit of your ball gets like caught in the zipper.

541
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,400
It's like a little bit, it's like a little less than that.

542
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
That's what I'm assuming.

543
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:46,400
But imagine that on your chest.

544
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
It was like, you know, like, I'm not going to elaborate.

545
00:32:49,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Anyways, I was just fucking loud.

546
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
I've had it before it hurts.

547
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Ouch.

548
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
You get in the hospital when you get caught in your zipper.

549
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Well, I mean, I didn't mean like if you're caught caught, like you can't get out.

550
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,400
I mean, like, when you kind of zip it up and just like pinches you a little bit.

551
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Like, because I'm like, I've done that.

552
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,400
I've done that to my pussy lip before and I was like, I'm just like, like, girl.

553
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,400
And then I'm just like, quickly.

554
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Okay, maybe it's not as bad as that.

555
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
That's unimaginable.

556
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,400
You guys are such fucking babies.

557
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,400
You nipple piercings hurt once they're there.

558
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
For the first like couple months.

559
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Yes, they're pretty tender.

560
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,400
I remember I went so I went with Salem, who I talk about often.

561
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
She we had only known each other for a week.

562
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Mind you, I'm like, hey, do you want to come with me and watch me get my nipples pierced?

563
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
And she's just like, oh my God, yes, sure.

564
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Because I want to walk like I want to get them done too.

565
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
And I'm like, okay, let's go.

566
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,400
And we go there.

567
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,400
First one goes in and I'm like, ow, that really hurt.

568
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,400
And I look over and look at Salem's face and her face is like completely mortified.

569
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:20,400
And then the piercer was telling me so usually the adrenaline kicks in only for the first one and then kind of tapers off for the second one.

570
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
So a lot of people don't get the second one done.

571
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm like, fuck it.

572
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Put the second one through.

573
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,400
And they did that and it hurt worse.

574
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
And I was like, ah.

575
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:35,400
And then I couldn't like put anything against my chest for like a month.

576
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I went right back to work.

577
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Because there was a piercing place in the mall and I just went back to work.

578
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
I went on my lunch break.

579
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
I'm like, fuck it.

580
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
I'm a badass bitch.

581
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
I just have barbells.

582
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,400
But they look cute in a shirt and stuff.

583
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
I know some people don't like them.

584
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,400
But like, I know Strawny's model has them.

585
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,400
My model doesn't have it though.

586
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,400
But it would be on brand for me to have it.

587
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,400
But like, I have a high pain tolerance.

588
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Strawny's model.

589
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Don't worry about it.

590
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Hi, mom.

591
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Hi, mom.

592
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Did mom read?

593
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Did you hi?

594
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Hello.

595
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Hey, I'm just presuming off of your alt account.

596
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Hey, listen.

597
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
They probably watched like 30 minutes.

598
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,400
So I was normal for the first about 30 minutes and now we're not normal.

599
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I didn't read you, but you should have read it.

600
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Can you guys hear Raina singing the song of her people in the background?

601
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,400
She be, Strawny is she be Donnie Dami mommy?

602
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
No.

603
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
She might be my mother.

604
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
She doesn't Dami though.

605
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Normal.

606
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
What about?

607
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
I already forgot what I was talking about.

608
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,400
But um, yeah, I have a high pain tolerance.

609
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
So she doesn't hurt me.

610
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Not sorry.

611
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
She was a doll.

612
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
It's too soft.

613
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
She's I am also dollar.

614
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Yeah.

615
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
I'm.

616
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Am I the tallest girl?

617
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Or is there?

618
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
I might be the tallest girl.

619
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
No.

620
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
It's a tallest girl.

621
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Am I the tallest girl out of all?

622
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
I can't remember.

623
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Strawny is a freaking small ass chick.

624
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Let me tell you that though.

625
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
I could probably rest my arm on her head.

626
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Why did I choose this game?

627
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Because I had the word bunny in it.

628
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,400
And I wanted to play something bunny related.

629
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
I'll take a seat.

630
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Well, no, I meant like like actual heights.

631
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Like I meant like RTX model heights.

632
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Out of normal heights.

633
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Yes.

634
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Is there is the tallest because she could fucking turn into a sky scraper.

635
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm just six feet in heels.

636
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,400
I'm normally like five, six in my little.

637
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Wait, am I five, six in heels?

638
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Does that mean I'm.

639
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,400
I'm just thinking because if I'm 168 centimeters while I'm wearing my red heels.

640
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Does that mean I'm actually like five, four whole is my life a lie?

641
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Holy.

642
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,400
You're the tallest girl since there are cheats because he's a giant.

643
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
That's true.

644
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
She just like stays tall.

645
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm getting bullied for my height.

646
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
I could sell.

647
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Because normally because normally I'm like I'm five, eight, five, nine.

648
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
But.

649
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,400
2D she be is five, six.

650
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
But I don't know if that's with heels or without heels.

651
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
So.

652
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Design Papa.

653
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,400
I'm going to need you to get on that and give me my canonical canon con height.

654
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Yep.

655
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Words.

656
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
English exists.

657
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Absolute.

658
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Absolute short stack.

659
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
I'm not.

660
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,400
I'm taller than the majority of people I interact with on a daily basis.

661
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Yes, it's mostly my cats.

662
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,400
But when I go back to work, I am literally taller than so many fucking people.

663
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
She be who is the ebony of this game?

664
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
You know, the Draco living golf.

665
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Who cuts because I don't know.

666
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I don't know.

667
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Maybe the girl with the black hair who kind of looks like that one chick from device.

668
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Halo device.

669
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
That sounds so bad.

670
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,400
I just, I just literally noticed right now that she kind of like looks like the girl from device.

671
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Hello from honey pop.

672
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Hey, quick question.

673
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Why is your thumbnail gray?

674
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
I think my thumbnail was nuked.

675
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah.

676
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Yeah.

677
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
So.

678
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Hey, scrawny, can you tell?

679
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Uh, manager to make me another thumbnail with a cover up so I can put that up instead.

680
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Because it got yanked.

681
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Thank you, mom.

682
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
I love you, mom.

683
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
You're the best, mom.

684
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Are you firing peeler allegation?

685
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Please do not make it.

686
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
Cock color.

687
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Yeah, my thumbnail guy.

688
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Yep.

689
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Zippity-doodle.

690
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Zippity-dade.

691
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
It wasn't even bad.

692
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,400
It was literally me standing almost like I was in a fucking t-pose because I did an emote for my face for the thumbnail.

693
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,400
So I'm just kind of just like standing there.

694
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,400
It was literally that I will show you what it was.

695
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Hold on.

696
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
It was literally me going like this.

697
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
No, not even with that.

698
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Just like.

699
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
That's why I got it nuked.

700
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
My thumbnails might all get yanked.

701
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,400
I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.

702
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,400
I guess I just have to become flat, you know, because flat's justice and all.

703
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Looks deviously at mother.

704
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Maybe I just have to become cute and funny.

705
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Looks deviously at mother.

706
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
It shows up in some fever blinds.

707
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Yeah, I noticed that.

708
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
I'd be too powerful with that.

709
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
You're right, you're right.

710
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
Do they know?

711
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
They're gonna know.

712
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
They're not gonna know.

713
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
I'm already cute and funny.

714
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
You know what is awesome?

715
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,400
So I ordered some stuff from Amazon for my ASMR this week.

716
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
What's today?

717
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Wednesday to March, Thursday, Power Wash collab.

718
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,400
I don't remember what day my own ASMR stream is.

719
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,400
But I got like Pop Rocks for a really cool trigger.

720
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
And they taste really good too.

721
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
I already had like one pack.

722
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Well, I'm finishing it up right now.

723
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
I don't know.

724
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,400
And those will get nuked for mouth sounds.

725
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
I don't know if, Johnny, did you already do this?

726
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Tell me in the news.

727
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Did you already do Pop Rocks?

728
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
I feel like you did.

729
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Yeah, I feel like it's really nice.

730
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
She did it with her feet sweat.

731
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Oh, I didn't know that part.

732
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Yeah, I ordered it a couple days ago.

733
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
They finally came in.

734
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
Thank you, mother.

735
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
What the fuck is this?

736
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Oh my God.

737
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
Why are you so fucking precious?

738
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
I can't.

739
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Major, is it around?

740
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Here you go.

741
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,400
A file name.

742
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Oh my, let me fix that.

743
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,400
And it's just a fucking screenshot of me being live right now.

744
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Oh, I can't.

745
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
You're too good for this earth.

746
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Oh my God, let me just.

747
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
I'm keeping this thumbnail.

748
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,400
I'm just straight keeping it.

749
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Even if they come back around to fix it.

750
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
I'm just, I'm keeping this one up.

751
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Graphic design is my passion.

752
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
It's Strani's passion, I should say.

753
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I can picture, I can picture your silly little face.

754
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Go he, he, he, he, in Scottish just.

755
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Hope you got, can you guys see it?

756
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
Your work.

757
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Can you guys see it?

758
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,400
Laffs in Scottish gasps in Spanish.

759
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
Anyways games.

760
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,280
Am I a dude?

761
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,280
This loud?

762
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Holy fuck.

763
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:37,160
That's a fucking loud.

764
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,800
It's perfect.

765
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,880
Or the thumbnail is perfect.

766
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,760
Is the sound fine?

767
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,080
Bye, strongy.

768
00:44:53,080 --> 00:45:14,080
Thank you for stopping by and making me an amazing thumbnail.

769
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:25,080
Oh wait, can I go back?

770
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,760
I got 15k again in my pocket.

771
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,960
Isn't that like a hundred and fifty bucks or something?

772
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,960
You know that face?

773
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:40,760
Onion Makes and Spikes family that got me and that gives me, yes, exactly that one.

774
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:48,760
Alright, I'm trying to think of a voice.

775
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,840
My company fired me.

776
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
It is what it is.

777
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,560
It's not the first time it's happened.

778
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,280
I'm thankful they hired me in the first place.

779
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,480
I have nothing but gratitude for the company.

780
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,040
My boss even cried for me when they fired me.

781
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,160
He said, I'm sorry I couldn't help you out.

782
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,360
They told me that this company isn't the right fit for me and that there are other places

783
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,480
where I could shine.

784
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,880
It was nice of them to say that.

785
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,920
Is there really somewhere out there?

786
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,680
Some place that would take in a fool like me?

787
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,520
Haito-kun?

788
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,160
Even if I could get another job somewhere else, I would just mess everything up for

789
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,560
the people there.

790
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,440
Ellipses.

791
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,400
Maybe my life ellipses is done for.

792
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,240
I didn't even think it has started.

793
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
Ellipses.

794
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,240
It's only been a minute in and I'm thinking about killing myself.

795
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,640
Time to drink my problems.

796
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,400
I guess he's the goth one.

797
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,400
He's ebony.

798
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:04,200
I'm pretty sure there's a barb somewhere in this building.

799
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,200
Oh, is she 3D?

800
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,200
Holy shit.

801
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:19,200
You just feel so cool in my mouth.

802
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:27,200
What sort of voice should we she have?

803
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:40,200
We're eating pop rocks.

804
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,200
Childhood friend voice?

805
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,200
Givers?

806
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,200
Okay, I'm just gonna put it to a poll.

807
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,200
I like how you call it like an Emmy voice when you just want me to do a lulley voice.

808
00:47:52,200 --> 00:48:20,200
No, I guess just don't say that.

809
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,200
Emmy sounds less gross.

810
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,200
Connie voice.

811
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,200
Give her a lisp.

812
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,200
There's lollibabas.

813
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,200
Hope by lollies.

814
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Aren't the girls voice in JP?

815
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,200
Yeah, but I'm fucking doing the voices.

816
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,200
Why would I?

817
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:50,200
Any time I'm reading a visual novel, I'm the one doing the voices.

818
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:57,200
My only excuse to do funny voices because the other times I do it when I'm just playing games, it doesn't make any fucking sense.

819
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
Okay?

820
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,200
That wasn't good.

821
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:09,200
Cute and funny voice, Scottish, really condescending childhood friend.

822
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:19,200
Or just wolf like a dog.

823
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,200
I'll just do like deep voice.

824
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:30,200
I don't know what that would be, but yeah.

825
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:40,200
Have fun.

826
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:47,200
We have three other, two other girls to voice.

827
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,200
Six out of, yeah, no, Toma knows I can do better.

828
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,200
Speaking of which, me and Toma have a collab coming up next week.

829
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Do little Pokemon smash her face.

830
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,200
She is bringing out one of her characters, Trinket.

831
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:12,200
I'm very excited.

832
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,200
It'll be so good.

833
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:24,200
That's my cat.

834
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:31,200
She's going to say smash a low-punny.

835
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Literally someone mentioned this a couple of streams ago.

836
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,200
I literally was just like, oh, I would do horrible things so low-punny.

837
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,200
I literally said that.

838
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Was that the mom I have a toy?

839
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
Yeah, she has her fluffy ball.

840
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,200
She likes to take it into the bathroom.

841
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
She likes to scream in the bathtub.

842
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
Don't ask me why she does that.

843
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,200
I call it singing the song of her people.

844
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,200
She's just letting the other cats know that she has caught something.

845
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:04,200
It's funny because Boomi and Fia don't do that.

846
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,200
But they'll go and run to her, all concerned.

847
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:13,200
Mr. Mime.

848
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,200
I'll save it for the collab.

849
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,200
Please check out Toma.

850
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:28,200
I have a lot of collabs next week.

851
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:39,200
Can you combine option two and three?

852
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,200
Scottish cute and funny boys.

853
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:50,200
I'm looking at you and I'm thinking that you're a bloody wanker.

854
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:56,200
No, that's not gonna... that's hard, actually.

855
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,200
I'm staring at you.

856
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,200
I'm looking at you.

857
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,200
Raina, what the fuck are you doing?

858
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,200
I don't know what my cat is doing.

859
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:15,200
Scotland Freda.

860
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,200
This calypso is mean enough.

861
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,200
All right, but I'm sorry condescending childhood friend one.

862
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,200
Raina, please.

863
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Mommy is straight. Raina.

864
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,200
Okay, I'm sorry.

865
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:39,200
Go tell her that she's did a good job. Hold on.

866
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,200
Hi.

867
00:52:42,200 --> 00:53:07,200
You're very full of energy today, huh?

868
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,200
Oh, my God.

869
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,200
She prays like that.

870
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,200
Raina wants to collab.

871
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,200
Give her a mic.

872
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,200
Me as a podcast with Raina.

873
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,200
Stare.

874
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,200
I'm sorry.

875
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:43,200
Just throwing out a guess here, but did something bad happen to you?

876
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,200
It's like it has a twinge of alley girl, you know?

877
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:54,200
That's why you're trying to drink and forget everything or...

878
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,200
Sorry, excuse me.

879
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,200
Are you trying to get me to go to your hostess club?

880
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,200
Yeah, you're wrong.

881
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:12,200
You just happened to catch my eye before I got to work.

882
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,200
I'm feeling when I come on stream to mess with you.

883
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,200
You come on stream to mess with me?

884
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
I ain't even reading the rest of that.

885
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:29,200
Maud's paying him by his piggy toes from the ceiling,

886
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:36,200
spinning him around while you waterboard him.

887
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:44,200
All right. Thank you.

888
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:50,200
You look so tired as if your life is over.

889
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Oh, this is like really quiet.

890
00:54:53,200 --> 00:55:06,200
I put the BGM too quiet, I think.

891
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:15,200
This is fucking loud.

892
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:33,200
You look tired. I can fix that.

893
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:43,200
Have you ever seen the grapefruit technique?

894
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,200
My soul?

895
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,200
The customers in my bar?

896
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,200
I don't need to do anything for people to come to Wonderland.

897
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,200
The classic technique.

898
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,200
Just look up the grapefruit technique.

899
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,200
Make sure you're alone though and that your headphones are in.

900
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,200
So, you know, it's a beautiful black woman holding a grapefruit

901
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,200
and she goes over her technique.

902
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,200
So highly recommend it.

903
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:20,200
Ladies that are watching.

904
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,200
I was in a group when I saw the O.

905
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,200
Bless your heart.

906
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,200
Very great technique. 10 out of 10.

907
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,200
It's nice to see that my male viewers are very progressive

908
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:38,200
in using it as well. Good job, guys.

909
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:45,200
Happy Pride.

910
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
You might be right.

911
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
I knew it. Yes.

912
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,200
Oh, sorry. This isn't something to be happy about.

913
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,200
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hit it right on the bullseye.

914
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,200
It's so sad to think your life is over.

915
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Yeah, I know.

916
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,200
What should I do?

917
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Oh, sorry, I'm thinking.

918
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,200
What should I do if I invite him in?

919
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,200
Then I'll really become a tout.

920
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
What the fuck does that mean?

921
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,200
But I can't leave someone so hurt out in the cold.

922
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,200
Girl, what are you talking about?

923
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
Why are you just talking?

924
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,200
I'm right here. I can hear what you're fucking saying.

925
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Got it. You don't have to come into the shop.

926
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,200
You can just have a sneak peek.

927
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,200
That's right.

928
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,200
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

929
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,200
The truth is, I work here.

930
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,200
Hello?

931
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,200
One of those is actually me.

932
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,200
The girl with the black bunny ears, they both fucking have them.

933
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,200
The girl in the yellow, she's me.

934
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
She's just me.

935
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,200
Make sure if you ever have grapefruit,

936
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,200
you shouldn't eat grapefruit while you're taking medication.

937
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,200
It's not safe.

938
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:07,200
Tip from your neighborhood.

939
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Dom.

940
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
No.

941
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,200
Literally human shit.

942
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,200
No.

943
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,200
I didn't know they opened this kind of bar here.

944
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,200
It's someplace where I can drink with girls.

945
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,200
I've never been in a shop like this before.

946
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,200
It's clean and the girls are cute.

947
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,200
I've only been to the really disgusting fucked up ones

948
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,200
where the girls look like they have track marks up their arms.

949
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,200
And have been huffing powder for hours.

950
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Excuse me, what are you saying?

951
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,200
Sorry, I got off on a tangent.

952
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,200
I guess I'll give it a try.

953
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,200
Ah, you're gonna get me in trouble, sir.

954
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,200
Huh, so I can't come in?

955
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,200
Why the fuck did you show me this if I can't come in?

956
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,200
That's all for today.

957
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,200
I'll just give you a glimpse.

958
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,200
If you come inside, then I'm really a tout.

959
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,200
What the fuck is a tout?

960
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:17,200
I give you the right to come to the shop as a customer.

961
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,200
Since when the fuck do you give me the right to go to a bar

962
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,200
where I pay money to hang out with you?

963
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,200
Anyways, whenever you're interested, I'll be waiting for you to come.

964
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,200
Why did you just ignore me?

965
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,200
You're so sincere.

966
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Don't forget, your life isn't over.

967
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,200
You'll be okay.

968
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
I know you will.

969
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,200
I can tell in your eyes.

970
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,200
So please, hand over your wallet.

971
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,200
Huh?

972
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,200
I was just kidding.

973
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,200
Right now, even if it was small, I know you smiled.

974
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
My dick's not small.

975
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
That means you're not done yet.

976
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,200
Thanks, I guess, fucking bitch.

977
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,200
I'll be here at the shop waiting for you.

978
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,200
I'm looking forward to the next time we can see each other

979
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,200
and I can rinse your wallet.

980
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,200
Alright, I'll let you go.

981
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,200
What the fuck was her deal?

982
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,200
She was so strange.

983
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,200
She doesn't even know me.

984
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,200
But I guess I do feel a little better.

985
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,200
Kind of tinted in my pants, seeing that girl bent over that table.

986
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,200
I'm such a simple guy.

987
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,200
Now, I don't know...

988
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:30,200
I'm making myself fucking laugh.

989
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,200
Now, I don't know if I really want to get drunk and forget everything.

990
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:39,200
I just want to go home.

991
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,200
Ellipses.

992
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,200
What the fuck is all night?

993
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:52,200
I thought that was a weird version of the girl's poster.

994
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,200
My life isn't over, huh?

995
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,200
Ellipses.

996
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,200
No way.

997
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Why would I take something a girl said to me seriously

998
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,200
when I don't even know her name?

999
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,200
I don't even remember what her face looks like.

1000
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,200
I was just staring at her tits.

1001
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:13,200
She didn't seem to be joking around, but, you know, her tits.

1002
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,200
Ellipses.

1003
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,200
I mean, it's not like anyone has ever told me that my life is done.

1004
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:23,200
Besides me, I contemplated suicide probably about 30 minutes ago.

1005
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,200
I'm the only one who thinks that if I don't finish it myself,

1006
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,200
maybe it's still possible to start again.

1007
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:36,200
Seriously, starts masturbating.

1008
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,200
Tout, a person soliciting customers.

1009
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,200
Oh.

1010
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:50,200
Attempt to sell something typically by pestering people in aggressive or bold manner.

1011
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,200
That doesn't make any fucking...

1012
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
She wasn't even being aggressive, though.

1013
01:01:53,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Why?

1014
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
Oh, hello.

1015
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
I'm sorry for calling you without notice.

1016
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,200
You know how you were saying work was busy and you needed help?

1017
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Did you still need help?

1018
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:17,200
If you'd like, would you take me in my anal virginity?

1019
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,200
It's me on the other end.

1020
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,200
I'm like, fine, we'll hire you.

1021
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,200
Come on down to Wonderland.

1022
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,200
I didn't owe your mom a favor.

1023
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,200
It's been a week since I started my new job.

1024
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,200
What should I use my money on?

1025
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,200
That being said, me being positive was all thanks to her.

1026
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,200
Not really.

1027
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,200
It was very superficial what she said because we just met.

1028
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,200
Should I go back to that chick shop?

1029
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,200
Oh shit, okay.

1030
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:51,200
How much is that in American money?

1031
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,200
Cool.

1032
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:59,200
This is more money I have in my bank account, probably.

1033
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,200
It's like 300 bucks?

1034
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,200
Yep, still accurate.

1035
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,200
Oh baby, a triple.

1036
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,200
Oh baby, a triple.

1037
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,200
Thank you, Saber.

1038
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Use my money on Sheeby.

1039
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Aw, thank you.

1040
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
Your tips are appreciated.

1041
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,200
Tips for Dora?

1042
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,200
Sheeby?

1043
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:30,200
Somebody made a really hilarious edit of all of our debuts in 2.0 and I could not stop laughing.

1044
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,200
It's like 40 minutes long.

1045
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,200
I can't...

1046
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,200
I think it's like Vealer debuts except it's just memes.

1047
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,200
Please give it a watch.

1048
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,200
You watched it?

1049
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,200
It's so hilarious.

1050
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,200
I was crying laughing because he opens up my portion with...

1051
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,200
Hey slaves!

1052
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:55,200
I was dying laughing at Shrani's part.

1053
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,200
Aw, it's so fucking funny.

1054
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,200
Yeah, please watch it.

1055
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,200
Give that person some clicks.

1056
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,200
They deserve it for all the memes they threw in.

1057
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
It's so hilarious.

1058
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,200
Azur's was really funny too.

1059
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,200
So I can enter the shop.

1060
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,200
Save.

1061
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,200
Let's do it.

1062
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,200
Aw, look.

1063
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,200
I can't get out.

1064
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,200
No.

1065
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:30,200
Why can't I just click on stuff and I have to press my back button?

1066
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,200
I can't go anywhere.

1067
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
I can...

1068
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
Can I go to McKellen?

1069
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,200
Okay, I have to go to the shop.

1070
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,200
I can sleep.

1071
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,200
I can...

1072
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,200
Aw, I am taking so many panty shots.

1073
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,200
Job hunting.

1074
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
Wait.

1075
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
I thought I had a job.

1076
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Why would I need to get another job?

1077
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,200
Gifted vacation?

1078
01:04:54,200 --> 01:05:00,200
So this is just be a fucking sugar daddy simulator.

1079
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,200
I can gamble?

1080
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
I'm rubbing my hands together.

1081
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Blackjack and hookers.

1082
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,200
Blackjack and hookers.

1083
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,200
Blackjack and hookers.

1084
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
Phim Domson.

1085
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,200
Am I just a...

1086
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,200
Am I just a piggy?

1087
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,200
Am I just a little piggy?

1088
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,200
Guys, by the way, I just want to let you know I don't do...

1089
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:30,200
I don't do that side of BDSM because it's very manipulative.

1090
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:37,200
A lot of the women who do that side of BDSM only do it because they know they get money.

1091
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,200
They don't care about the people that they work with.

1092
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,200
They don't approve of it.

1093
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,200
I don't like it.

1094
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,200
I've been asked before if I will do financial domination.

1095
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,200
No.

1096
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,200
I am just me and you donate if you want to.

1097
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,200
And it is appreciated.

1098
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:13,200
I told my parents, by the way, I have a surprise for them because I'm going to give them the $200 that you guys donated in the stream where I mentioned that my dad was very sick.

1099
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,200
And so my parents were like, ooh, what's happening?

1100
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,200
And I'm just going to give it to them.

1101
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:26,200
I'll tell you guys what their reaction will be because I know they'll really appreciate it.

1102
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,200
And they seemed like super like, what are you?

1103
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,200
I'm like courtesy of my awesome streaming fans.

1104
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,200
And my parents are like, my dad was like, oh, emoji.

1105
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,200
And my mom was just like, oh, they're so sweet.

1106
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,200
So yeah, my parents do know that I live stream.

1107
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,200
They're very supportive.

1108
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:48,200
They know that I also do NSFW audios.

1109
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:53,200
I'm very honest with my parents.

1110
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:59,200
My dad, when I told them I got into Vealer, my mom was like, oh my gosh.

1111
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,200
Yay.

1112
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,200
And my dad was like, yay.

1113
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:06,200
And I'm like explaining to them the sort of content I'll be making like ASMR, my parents don't know what ASMR is.

1114
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:12,200
And then my dad's like, OK, I have to ask, are you doing any sex work?

1115
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:19,200
And I literally was like, ehh, lude audios.

1116
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:28,400
He's like, I don't want to know, I don't want to know, but I will be taking my cut because

1117
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:35,600
I taught you how to do voices and I'm like, fuck you dad.

1118
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:40,880
He's like, I'm just gonna take credit for your well, your great reading skills and your

1119
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:47,800
ability to do voices and I would like my cut and I'm like, alright dad.

1120
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,560
He's like, just you know, 20% and I'm like, my mom's like, my mom's like, redacted, stop

1121
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,800
it, stop teasing her.

1122
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,800
Then my mom's like, but I want to be on your channel.

1123
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,800
I'm like, okay.

1124
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,080
My parents are fucking leeches guys, just kidding, no they're very supportive.

1125
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,360
I love them to death, they're very proud of me because they know I've wanted to be a content

1126
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:11,720
creator for a very long time.

1127
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,360
I think it was this shop here, I'm a bit nervous though, why is this, they have like

1128
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:26,040
a menu outside, like it's a restaurant, me more tea, parents are sick, oh, anonymous

1129
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:34,800
tipped $1, thank you anonymous queen, our entire singular dollar from your pay piggy.

1130
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,600
Good job piggy.

1131
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:42,400
Now we're going to do a retweet game where I'm going to have everybody retweet and every

1132
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:48,240
five retweets is $5 and whatever the else the fuck that they say when they do those

1133
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:55,520
weird ass things and then I want to get a manicure and then you're a piggy.

1134
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,160
I'm going to rinse the pig, give me your wallet.

1135
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:12,120
VodCon, she's unnatural, no it's because, so when I first, when I finally was able to

1136
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:19,800
log into my NSFW, I mean my alternative account on Twitter, I was like trying to go through

1137
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:26,560
and there's just like a lot of like fucking like sex bots and I'm like okay and like the

1138
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:34,440
majority of them were goddesses and queens and mistresses and they were all just doing

1139
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:38,440
like, like had that verbiage and I'm like what the fuck is, like I'm like why is this

1140
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,440
on my timeline?

1141
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:46,360
And I started just like following like anti-artists and retubers and then I finally went away.

1142
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:50,960
I'm like fuck this timeline, I don't want these bitches on my timeline.

1143
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:58,480
It's free money, yeah but I don't feel good about it.

1144
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:02,480
Like a tip is different because you're tipping me because you're enjoying my content.

1145
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:11,400
What they're doing is they're, they're, like they're not doing it because they want to

1146
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:17,360
assist in, trying to say this so that it's okay for you two but at this point I kind

1147
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,360
of don't give a fuck.

1148
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:30,000
They don't really care about like helping out their little piggy, you know, they just

1149
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:37,160
want the money, they don't care about like the actual like relationship of it and it's

1150
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:44,480
like the respect of it because there's, yeah I don't know, never mind.

1151
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,120
Yeah, they're not really entertainers, it's like like and the girls just like had their

1152
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:56,920
fucking feet out and they're like send me a tribute of $20 to DM me and I'm like what

1153
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,480
the fuck is this?

1154
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:06,400
It just, ah I'm sorry, just like it genuinely like irritates me but yeah but then just donate,

1155
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:13,720
who donate, enjoy that but I also think I'm like it's kind of, it's kind of predatory.

1156
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:20,080
Unless you have a lot of expendable income, you know, but I don't judge the people who

1157
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:24,720
get pleasure from it, I don't, that's fine, you do you.

1158
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:31,880
I'm not a huge fan of the people that take advantage of those people, that's it.

1159
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,120
And those bots are annoying and most of them are fake anyways so most people are just DMing

1160
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:49,400
some random cash app of like a dude in Texas who stole his wife's feed picks and is rinsing

1161
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,400
out piggies.

1162
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:55,960
But hey, at least I'm in his family could get to Disney.

1163
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:03,360
Problem is that some of those men are just having their low impulse control ticket,

1164
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:10,640
that's what I mean, that's another point, like there's that as well, 100%.

1165
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:15,400
I would like to YouTube money but I gotta admit, yeah.

1166
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:26,960
I want someone like, first and foremost, take care of yourself, that's all I say.

1167
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,600
A day in white tipped one dollar, so what you're saying is they want the tip but don't care

1168
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,040
about the tip.

1169
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:42,680
Anonymous tipped five dollars, based, based, thank you Anonymous, thank you for the tip.

ran away.

1178
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,520
You know, it's important, you don't crush the center, it's the sides of the neck because

1179
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:52,120
you're trying to cut off the, the, the car, our toy, like a girl out to dinner, artery.

1180
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:58,120
Named sword tipped six dollars and ninety cents, hot, hot, because you don't want to

01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:03,240
crush their windpipe, but off blood flow, not air flow, precisely.

1182
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:08,240
Anyways, as I was saying, I'm stroking your beautiful face right now, aka my phone.

1183
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:14,240
Um, let me give you a little kiss, muah, oh I just shut off my monitor, shit, okay.

1184

Um, ah, there you go, inhale that before I continue, take care of yourself, the anime

1185
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:29,920
girls that you watch and you support, they appreciate you, they care about you, but make

1186
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:36,160
sure you pay your bills on time, make sure you eat, make sure you do self-care and self-love,

1187
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:52,160
they will be okay, alright, alright, phones beautiful are us, both, I heard the hand,

01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:57,160
it was like a bee and you made it, well aren't you just the sweetest.

1189
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:01,160
Anonymous tipped twenty dollars, thank you madam, you're the best.

1190
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:05,160

Hafi zero zero two tipped six dollars and ninety cents, I don't fall for those kind of scams.

Anyway, here is my investment in shiba coin to the moon, well aren't you just the sweetest,

1193

Anonymous tipped fifteen dollars, harder mistress.

1195
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,160
the sweetest.

1196
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:37,160
This is going against what the fuck are you talking about.

1197
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:41,160
This is Reverse Findem, we are being financially submissified.

1198
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:47,160
Oh my god, I'm not even trying to do like reverse psychology or anything, you guys are

1199
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:56,160
just fucking, I can't even think of a word to insult you if that's how much I'm frustrated

1200
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,160
with your kindness.

1201
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:06,160
Why does my fan base have to be such nice fucking people, pieces of shit, supporting your creators

1202
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:10,160

Anonymous tipped fifty dollars, get spoiled.

1204

Thank you Anonymous, for the fifty bucks.

1205
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,160
We're just, we're just dumb.

1206
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,160
What was that sound alert?

1207
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,160
I don't know, don't you have fifty bucks?

1208
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,160
I'm fine, no I'm kidding.

1209
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:38,160
It's me going, I'm going to pre, how dare you financially support me especially since

1210
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,160
office jobs suck.

1211
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:46,160
Yeah, it's kind of like, I have this weird thing where I'm like, I like, like I want

1212
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:51,160
to be a streamer full time, but if I'm a streamer full time that means I have to, you know,

1213
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:57,160
mostly rely on you guys for, to just like let me live.

1214
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:06,160
And I don't like putting that responsibility on people, but I also like, a little imposter

1215
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,160
syndrome, like don't spend your money on me.

1216
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:12,160
Cause I'm like, I have like, I have a part time job now and I'm doing okay.

1217
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,160
Like I just hate taking money from people, I don't know, like it's just weird.

1218
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,160
Well are you just the sweetest?

1219
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,160
Anonymous tipped five dollars.

Thank you Anonymous.

Anyways, anyways, enough of that fucking shit.

1225
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,160
I'm going to make some tea.

1226
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:13,160
Awesome sugar on there.

1227
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,160
Here we are.

1228
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,160
Hi, there's a boy.

1229
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,160
Hello.

1230
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,160
Aren't you so snuggly today?

1231
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,160
Yeah.

1232
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,160
You're scritches.

1233
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,160
You're snuggly scritches.

1234
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,160
Oh yeah.

1235
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:35,160
But uh, thank you guys.

1236
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,160
I'm coming over.

1237
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,160
I have my headphones on.

1238
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,160
Nonetheless, thank you for your support.

1239
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,160
I appreciate it.

1240
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,160
I care about you guys.

1241
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:49,160
It's only been like a week and a half.

1242
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:54,160
And I am just so thankful and feel like I don't deserve any of it.

1243
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,160
But I do, cause I'm your mistress stomps on your face.

1244
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,160
Fuck you.

1245
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,160
I'm the best you've ever had, bitch.

1246
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:08,160
I hope my neighbors can't hear me, cause I was stuck.

1247
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,160
Shibi was my first ever exposure that led me to the other girls.

1248
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,160
And I found her funny and amusing.

1249
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,160
I couldn't wait until debut and streams began.

1250
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,160
So I'm pretty happy to see her.

1251
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,160
Hope things gave me, oh, thank you.

1252
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,160
Thank you.

1253
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,160

You guys are like, you guys are too good to all of us.

Like you guys, um, you guys are so sweet.

Like, I'm gonna preach.

Only know a night and tipped $100.

1259
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,160
Jesus.

1260
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,160
Have my wallet.

1261
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,160
I mean my wallet.

1262
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:42,160

Guys.

1266
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,160
Fucking mad lads.

1267
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,160
Thank you.

1268
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:55,160
Only know only chan anonymous tip to dollars.

1269
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,160
Is this how we win?

1270
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,160
Thank you.

1271
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,160
Jesus.

1272
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,160
Oh, what I was gonna say, I'll say it from across the room.

1273
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,160
You can't see me.

1274
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,160
I'm waving.

1275
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,160
Hello.

1276
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,160
Hi.

1277
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,160
I'm far away.

1278
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,160
Um, like I added.

1279
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,160
You guys are gonna make fun of me and that's okay.

1280
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,160
I don't mind it.

1281
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,160
Cause I'm a grown bitch.

1282
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,160
All right.

1283
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,160
If you're going to call me a bitch,

1284
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,160
you better put sense in it in front of it.

1285
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:19,160
Um, but I put on my throne a bed frame.

1286
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,160
Because I'm a grown bitch.

1287
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,160
I'm a grown bitch.

1288
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,160
I'm a grown bitch.

1289
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,160
I'm a grown bitch.

1290
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,160
I'm a grown bitch.

1291
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:28,160
Um, but I put on my throne a bed frame because I don't have one.

1292
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,160
I've been sleeping on a mattress on the floor for almost two years now.

1293
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:37,160
Like, you know, that one picture of that guy, like, like he's like, uh, right.

1294
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:41,160
My apartment is like a TV in like a lawn chair.

1295
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,160
My apartment was that for the longest time.

1296
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,160
And you guys are just so nice.

1297
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,160
Somebody bought me a bed frame and I'm like,

1298
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,160
Oh my God.

1299
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,160
Oh my God.

1300
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,160
I don't have to sleep on the floor.

1301
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,160
Uh, people are too kind.

1302
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:06,160
That's like, I, I hope that like when I become big enough,

1303
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,160
I can spread that sort of love, you know,

1304
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,160
like, uh, do like, uh, charity streams.

1305
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,160
I think that would be really cool.

1306
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,160
That would be really neat.

1307
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,160
The water, ah!

1308
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,160
It's burning myself in the water.

1309
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:30,160
But yeah, like, I would love to also just like help out smaller creators

1310
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:36,160
by like, collabing with smaller creators or like, um,

1311
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,160
maybe like,

1312
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:45,160
picking someone in a community who like wants to be a Vtuber, like helping them fund their model.

1313
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:50,160
I feel like that would probably go bad, but you know, I'm just too nice for my own fucking good.

1314
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,160
We need help. Okay.

1315
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,160
I know someone who's went to UK and still does on the streamer.

1316
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:05,160
I remember it when I, um, one of my friends,

1317
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:09,160
she like, uh, one of my, like, um, Jesus fuck.

1318
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,160
Anonymous tipped $50.

1319
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,160
Here's to a future bed frame.

1320
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,160
Also, give some to your dad.

1321
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,160
No, I have a bed frame, but thank you.

1322
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,160
I will.

1323
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:22,160
I'll let him buy some of my comic books or something.

1324
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,160
He'll treat himself.

1325
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,160
It's like, I don't know, like, Starbucks coffee or something.

1326
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:37,160
When I first started streaming, one of the people I became a mutuals with,

1327
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,160
she just, she started streaming later than me,

1328
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:44,160
and then someone donated her 7k dot, like 7k.

1329
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,160
I remember the context as to why they were just like,

1330
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:51,160
and just like whipped it at her during stream.

1331
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,160
And I'm sitting there watching the stream.

1332
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:55,160
I'm like, what the fuck?

1333
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,160
Like people just like, people are, yeah.

1334
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,160
I was like, holy crap.

1335
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:04,160
People just like, I just, I just want to know, I'm like, what did they do as a job?

1336
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,160
Like, you know those guys that like do this tiktoks?

1337
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,160
They're like, hey, what do you do for a living?

1338
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,160
I just want to ask those people what they do for a living.

1339
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,160
Just buy one big bed frame and combine them.

1340
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,160
Crazy.

1341
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:27,160
I imagine like a, like a Saudi prince just like really being obsessed with VTubers.

1342
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:30,160
That's actually kind of awesome.

1343
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:35,160
But, um, like, but it's, but it's you guys.

1344
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:38,160
Like, I need to make this point to you.

1345
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:43,160
It's you guys that keep the VTubing community afloat.

1346
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:50,160
Don't ever forget that without our fan base, there would be no us.

1347
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:54,160
There would be no VTuber and VTubing.

1348
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:57,160
So that's why your support means a lot.

1349
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:01,160
However, you know, there's a fine line just because you do donate.

1350
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:09,160
It does not mean you're entitled to all the VTubers attention, et cetera.

1351
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:20,160
Just, yeah, I don't think I really need to elaborate on that because you are all adults, mostly some of you, I presume, here.

1352
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:25,160
I'm going to get rich so I can do the ties, right?

1353
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:36,160
Like, I like, so like, I always said to myself, I'm like, okay, if I ever blow up and become like a VTuber, fuck you, money, I'm just throwing it at other streamers.

1354
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,160
I'm just fucking you.

1355
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,160
Left, right.

1356
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,160
You get cash.

1357
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,160
You get cash.

1358
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,160
You get cash.

1359
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,160
Because I'm not someone who like needs a lot.

1360
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,160
Like, I'm cool.

1361
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,160
All I want is a house and I'm good.

1362
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,160
I want a house and debt-free.

1363
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:54,160
I'm just living with my cats and my chickens and my goats and my quail.

1364
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,160
I decided I want quail, by the way.

1365
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:59,160
And I want to run a rescue and that's it.

1366
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,160
That's it.

1367
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:02,160
That's it.

1368
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,160
I don't care for fucking fancy cars.

1369
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:09,160
I don't wear a designer because that's fucking stupid.

1370
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:16,160
So I'm like, yeah, we're chilling.

1371
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,160
We're chilling.

1372
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,160
And my BDSM room.

1373
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,160
Yep.

1374
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:28,160
Imagine I get a house and I just have like a red room from like 50 Shades and I just

1375
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,160
film everything in there.

1376
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:36,160
I have like the cat cam and it's just like, there's a little like bed and on a like,

1377
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,160
like human furniture.

1378
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:42,160
Like I have somebody just like sitting there, just like holding my cats up.

1379
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,160
No peacocks.

1380
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,160
I don't know what I would do with peacocks when I sell the feathers.

1381
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:59,160
And I also want to pay off my mom's debt and my dad's debt and buy my parents a house.

1382
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:07,160
I mean, it's like an overlay but I'll, I guess, considering you're a Don Lorwitz.

1383
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,160
Don't go to the basement.

1384
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,160
That's where Mercy is though.

1385
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:15,160
She lives in my, the apartment below me.

1386
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,160
The like, the, what is it?

1387
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,160
Like the in-law suite or whatever it's called.

1388
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,160
I don't remember what it's called.

1389
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,160
I don't know if they call it the same thing in other places outside of America.

1390
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:29,160
But like normally there's like a whole other like livable space below like the main house

1391
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:33,160
that usually people like have their family live in.

1392
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:34,160
So Mercy's down there.

1393
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:37,160
She's in the basement with her, you know, senpai.

1394
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,160
She likes to tie up.

1395
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,160
She doesn't question it or anything.

1396
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,160
And keeps all, yeah, exactly.

1397
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,160
She keeps all you guys there.

1398
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:44,160
Feelers just want to go.

1399
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,160
I made a joke.

1400
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:48,160
I'm like, viewer content house when?

1401
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,160
And we were all like, ah.

1402
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:58,160
It's just Zoe burger but like V2 burgers.

1403
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,160
You could sell farm.

1404
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,160
That's what I want to do.

1405
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,160
I want to sell chicken eggs.

1406
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,160
And I want to sell quail eggs.

1407
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,160
And Strani is like this.

1408
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,160
I'm telling you, me and her are the same person.

1409
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:19,160
I'm just brown and she's Scottish because she said she wants to do the same exact thing.

1410
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:27,160
And she just wants to have a little nice sanctuary in this like live in the countryside or some shit

1411
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,160
and take care of her animals.

1412
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,160
And I love her for that.

1413
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,160
Has any content house gone well?

1414
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,160
No.

1415
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:35,160
We're changing that.

1416
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,160
We all have to move to one country for our content.

1417
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,160
I don't know.

1418
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,160
What would be the best place for us to move?

1419
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,160
What kind of brown on you?

1420
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,160
The biracial kind?

1421
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,160
I don't know.

1422
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:54,160
What flavor of black are you?

1423
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,160
Texas.

1424
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,160
I'm not fucking going to Texas.

1425
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,160
No, I have had people.

1426
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:08,160
So like, again, I work in retail.

1427
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:11,160
People always because I'm very ethnically ambiguous looking.

1428
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:18,160
I got mistaken for so many different things because I just, I don't know.

1429
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,160
I'm like fucking mystique from X-Men.

1430
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:23,160
I just look like everybody except Asian.

1431
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,160
Actually, no, that's a lie.

1432
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,160
One time somebody thought I was Malaysian.

1433
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:32,160
They thought I was mixed because how I like did my makeup and like it was when I was really into K-pop idols.

1434
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:39,160
So I did my makeup like them and it gave me a little bit of like a little Malaysian look and I was like, I look hot as fuck.

1435
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,160
But I'm not Asian.

1436
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,160
I'm blue.

1437
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,160
Yes, I'm blue.

1438
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,160
What's my hex code?

1439
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,160
Hey, but what kind of would you ever want to come up here?

1440
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:59,160
I've actually been, yeah, this is, I guess this is Zatsu so much for playing a game.

1441
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,160
I hate myself.

1442
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,160
I've been to Quebec and I've been to Montreal.

1443
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,160
Oh, I do like those places.

1444
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:16,160
I love Zatsu.

1445
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,160
Every stream is a Zatsu in disguise.

1446
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,160
This is like aim stream?

1447
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:28,160
It's because I get distracted and I go off on tangents and then I want to elaborate on those tangents.

1448
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:31,160
And then you guys ask me another question and then I get more.

1449
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,160
It's your fault.

1450
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,160
It's all I'm going to say.

1451
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,160
Oh, her name is, how the fuck do I know her name now?

1452
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,160
Ah, hold on.

1453
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,160
I need to sip a tea before I start this.

1454
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,160
I don't even, I'm not even diagnosed ADHD.

1455
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,160
I'm just, I'm just fucking weird.

1456
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,160
Chat reflects the streamer.

1457
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,160
Good point.

1458
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:57,160
Nine more hours and we hit the daily and strength interns quota.

1459
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,160
I don't even get questioned.

1460
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:03,160
People thought I was Chinese, Japanese, Korean, but I'm Filipino.

1461
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,160
Just monolingual and stuff.

1462
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,160
Yeah, I understand.

1463
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,160
Um, oh yeah.

1464
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,160
But my, my story, I'm just going to do it.

1465
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:12,160
Then I'll do, um, I'll say my story, then I'll continue with the game.

1466
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,160
I fucking promise.

1467
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,160
I'm adding to my goal list.

1468
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:22,160
Like actually do nothing but a game for the, for two hours.

1469
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,160
Well, that'll kind of, well, good thing we're playing power,

1470
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,160
power watch simulator tomorrow.

1471
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,160
Cause then I can, yeah, and game.

1472
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,160
I'll probably just end up standing around and the girls are doing all the work

1473
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,160
and I'm just like, no, no, no, no, no.

1474
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,160
Shabby, shut up.

1475
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,160
Okay.

1476
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:44,160
Um, so this person came in and they were speaking to me and they were

1477
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,160
speaking to me and Spanish.

1478
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,160
And I'm like, Lo siento, no hablas español.

1479
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,160
Um, I only speak English.

1480
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,160
And they were just like, what?

1481
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:58,160
And I'm like, yeah, they're like, but you look Spanish.

1482
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,160
And I'm like, I'm not.

1483
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:03,160
They're just like, yeah, but you're Spanish.

1484
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,160
And I'm like, but I'm not.

1485
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,160
And they're like, you're Spanish.

1486
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,160
I'm like, I'm, I'm black.

1487
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,160
And they're like, no, you're not.

1488
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,160
And I'm like, what the fuck?

1489
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,160
They're like, you don't look black.

1490
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:20,160
And I'm like, my mom is white.

1491
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,160
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

1492
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:27,160
I'm Mr. Worldwide.

1493
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,160
I'm Shibi Worldwide.

1494
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:31,160
And the person's just like, well, you look Spanish.

1495
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,160
You should learn Spanish.

1496
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,160
And they're like, okay, what type of black are you?

1497
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,160
I'm like, I'm Haitian.

1498
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,160
I'm half, I'm half Haitian.

1499
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:45,160
And then I'm like a bunch of other white things.

1500
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:50,160
Literally, I have like a 15 thing list on my mom's side of what I am.

1501
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:57,160
And they're just like, oh, but like, Haiti's like right next to the Dominican.

1502
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,160
So you're pretty much Spanish.

1503
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,160
And I'm like, oh my fucking god.

1504
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,160
You're like, you came from there?

1505
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:08,160
I'm like, no, I was, I was born in America.

1506
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,160
Please.

1507
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:22,160
And I'm just sitting there and then they would like speak in like Spanglish to me.

1508
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:29,160
And it's also hard because I, because I worked at my job for so long and we have a very large Spanish speaking population.

1509
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:34,160
I do know quite a bit of Spanish and I could kind of usually follow along to what people are saying.

1510
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:38,160
So she would slip into Spanish and I would just respond in English.

1511
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:43,160
And so she's like, she looked at me and said, you're fucking lying to me in Spanish.

1512
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,160
And I'm like, no, I'm not lying to you.

1513
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,160
She's like, how do you know what I'm saying?

1514
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,160
And I'm like, I'm, I just know a little bit of Spanish.

1515
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,160
Like, what are you?

1516
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:57,160
The racial mental gymnastics.

1517
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:11,160
But it's funny because then like, but it's, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm not going to tell you my last name,

1518
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:17,160
but I will say my last name is Arabic, but I'm not Arabic.

1519
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:21,160
I'm not, I don't even know where that comes from.

1520
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:31,160
And so people, customers who hear my last name that are like Middle Eastern or from Africa or from what they're just like,

1521
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,160
Oh, speaks to me in Arabic.

1522
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:41,160
And I'm just like, and then I have people who are from Egypt because apparently I look at gypsy and they're like speaks to me in the main language of Egypt.

1523
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:49,160
And I'm like, no, I have people who think I'm like Cape Verdean and they're just like speaks to me in Cape Verdean.

1524
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:52,160
And then I also know a little bit of Chinese.

1525
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:56,160
So people will be like, Oh, are you half Chinese?

1526
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,160
I'm like, no.

1527
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,160
All I said was Ni Hao Ma.

1528
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,160
What was she?

1529
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,160
She's here.

1530
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,160
That's all I know.

1531
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,160
Yeah.

1532
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:15,160
My last name.

1533
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,160
Yeah, cotton bum is an Arabic last name.

1534
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,160
I don't know though.

1535
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:31,160
But yeah, I'm very, it's very fun because I usually, because customers will be like, okay, what are you?

1536
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,160
I'm like, guess.

1537
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:35,160
And so I get like the widest fucking range of guesses.

1538
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:42,160
You know that like one guy who, um, what's his name?

1539
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:44,160
Thanks to Cody Co.

1540
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,160
Noel Miller.

1541
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:46,160
Is that his name?

1542
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,160
Yeah.

1543
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,160
Who did like, they were like big on vine and all that shit.

1544
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,160
You know how everybody like tries to guess his race?

1545
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:54,160
That is how my customers are with me.

1546
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:56,160
Just learn Spanish.

1547
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,160
Full of Duolingo.

1548
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,160
Because I don't even know what Noel Miller is.

1549
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,160
I'm like, is he Asian?

1550
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,160
Is he Spanish?

1551
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,160
Is he something else?

1552
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,160
Is he just white?

1553
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,160
In the end, I'm just a guy.

1554
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,160
I'm sorry if that breaks your immersion.

1555
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,160
Apologize.

1556
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:24,160
I know some people don't like to hear about this sort of stuff, but I'm an honest person and I like to talk and I like to yeah.

1557
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:29,160
So, and then you would have fucking found out anyways when you see my tan ass hand.

1558
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:33,160
On a hand cam stream.

1559
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:36,160
Or my legs on a thigh cam stream.

1560
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:39,160
You'd be like, Leonardo DiCaprio point.

1561
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:41,160
What the fuck is that?

1562
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,160
My immersion.

1563
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,160
I do have bunny ears though.

1564
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,160
I genuinely have bunny ears.

1565
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,160
Don't, don't forget that like I actually have bunny ears.

1566
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,160
I was born with a deformity.

1567
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,160
I don't like to talk about it.

1568
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:01,160
I do have bunny ears.

1569
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,160
I don't have human ears.

1570
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:03,160
I just have bunny ears.

1571
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:04,160
Yep.

1572
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,160
It's fine.

1573
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,160
YouTube just tends to add a lighter filter.

1574
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,160
That's actually true though.

1575
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:20,160
When I was streaming on Twitch and I did my first hand cam doing like kind of the cooking popping the popping cooking that like Emmy did.

1576
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:28,160
My hands look so fucking white on Twitch for my webcam.

1577
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:33,160
The people were like, why the fuck are you talking about being proud?

1578
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:36,160
And I'm like, no, the saturation was down.

1579
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,160
The lighting was bad.

1580
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:45,160
I'm telling you, I haven't been outside in many moons.

1581
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,160
I changed colors.

1582
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,160
I'm a fucking chameleon.

1583
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:54,160
Sure.

1584
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:59,160
My white mother laughs at me in the daily because she's darker than me right now.

1585
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:06,160
Yes, I am working on getting a tan toggle for my avatar for my avatar for me.

1586
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:07,160
What the fuck am I saying?

1587
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:10,160
This isn't avatar the last airbender or the blue people.

1588
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,160
My vitamin D deficient.

1589
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,160
Yes.

1590
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:16,160
Yes, I am.

1591
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,160
Give me some of that D.

1592
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,160
Sunny D.

1593
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:25,160
Unleash the power of the sun.

1594
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,160
Am I right?

1595
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,160
Well, no, it'll be a toggle.

1596
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,160
I'm going to be pulling an iron mouse.

1597
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,160
I've already said that.

1598
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:34,160
Pulling an iron mouse.

1599
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:38,160
I'm going to be she be cotton bum and she be copper bum.

1600
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,160
Instead of copper cat.

1601
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,160
Copper.

1602
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,160
Copper bum.

1603
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:58,160
Ah, yes.

1604
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,160
Is it me streaming today?

1605
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:04,160
I haven't looked at the fucking schedule.

1606
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:08,160
Log in.

1607
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,160
No, she's not streaming today.

1608
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,160
Okay.

1609
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:16,160
I'll stream a little bit past my time so we can actually get to game.

1610
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,160
Is there in two hours?

1611
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,160
Okay, I'll probably, I'll stream into a zero then.

1612
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,160
Any relation to Rodney copper?

1613
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,160
No.

1614
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:31,160
I am canonically related to every bunny character.

1615
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:38,160
However, distant related to Mr. Hopps and Lola Bunny, Jessica Rabbit,

1616
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:41,160
and all other bunny VTubers also fall under that sphere.

1617
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,160
The AutoCast fashion one.

1618
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,160
At some point.

1619
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,160
If only there was a combined schedule for other girls that we can see.

1620
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,160
Well, we have our own little thing for that.

1621
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:55,160
I just looked at it.

1622
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:57,160
You guys can make your own.

1623
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:05,160
I think Manesan is working on updating the website,

1624
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:07,160
so it does show all of our schedules.

1625
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,160
That would actually be really cool.

1626
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:12,160
Bonnie from FNA- yes.

1627
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:14,160
BigChunkus is a cousin of mine.

1628
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,160
Jessica Rabbit was just her married name.

1629
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:20,160
Yeah, because I'm related to Roger Rabbit.

1630
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:25,160
And Jessica is related to me by marriage.

1631
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,160
Yep.

1632
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,160
LowPunny is my first cousin once.

1633
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,160
No.

1634
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,160
No.

1635
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:34,160
This is not Alabama.

1636
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,160
Bugs Bunny.

1637
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,160
Yeah, they're related to me.

1638
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:41,160
Related to JoJo Rabbit.

1639
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,160
I actually watched them the other day.

1640
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,160
It was pretty actually fucking funny.

1641
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:45,160
I love Taiko.

1642
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:47,160
I didn't finish it though.

1643
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,160
I think I fell asleep.

1644
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,160
You can see the resemblance.

1645
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:54,160
Yeah.

1646
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:58,160
Although, how do we have resemblance if she's related to me by marriage, guys?

1647
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,160
Related to Peter Rabbit.

1648
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:03,160
He's a...

1649
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:07,160
Any anthropomorphic bunnies,

1650
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:09,160
like LowPunny because she's like a Pokemon,

1651
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:12,160
but she doesn't have sentience like a human like Bugs does.

1652
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,160
They are not really...

1653
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,160
They are extremely distant.

1654
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,160
Extremely distant, you know?

1655
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:26,160
Okay, is it funny or is it boring that you fell asleep midway?

1656
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:27,160
No, I just fell...

1657
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,160
I was just up really late.

1658
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,160
And I just...

1659
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:33,160
Sometimes, you know how you put something on to fall asleep too?

1660
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,160
Or just to listen to?

1661
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,160
I was really into the first half.

1662
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,160
I literally...

1663
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,160
I think 30 minutes or 40 minutes to finish.

1664
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:46,160
Yes, I do have acme powers.

1665
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:52,160
And my acme powers, it means I can inflate, flatten out,

1666
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,160
do a lot of different things.

1667
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:58,160
Just like, you know, how Bugs Bunny does in cartoons

1668
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:00,160
and Roger Rabbit, I am...

1669
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:02,160
I do have toon powers.

1670
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,160
I do have toon powers, yep.

1671
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,160
So basically, exactly.

1672
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:09,160
Just like Luffy.

1673
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,160
Toon for you, exactly.

1674
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,160
No.

1675
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:14,160
No inflation.

1676
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,160
None of that.

1677
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:20,160
None of that inflation cake, please.

1678
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:26,160
Chibi Chungus.

1679
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,160
Does paint thinner kill you?

1680
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:30,160
It hurts a little.

1681
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,160
Like it burns a little.

1682
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:34,160
It's like when you stick your hand on a hot stove,

1683
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:37,160
but it won't kill me.

1684
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,160
You're not Google Sonic.

1685
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:44,160
I wasn't planning on Googling Sonic inflation.

1686
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,160
It's too late, you're canonizing.

1687
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:48,160
I am...

1688
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,160
I can retcon it too.

1689
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:54,160
I can retcon it too, bitch.

1690
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,160
Won't kill you, but this is mean you'll enjoy it.

1691
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,160
Exactly.

1692
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,160
Inflation in this economy.

1693
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,160
Cartoon versus anime jeans.

1694
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,160
Exactly, because like I have my anime jeans

1695
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:12,160
and I have my cartoon jeans, you know?

1696
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:14,160
Who are my parents?

1697
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:15,160
I don't know.

1698
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,160
To be honest with you, I don't know who my parents are.

1699
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:19,160
My RTX parents, they're pretty cool,

1700
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:23,160
but my 2D parents, I don't really know too much about them.

1701
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:27,160
One might be, you know, one might be just like,

1702
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:29,160
I don't like, there is a family rumor.

1703
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:32,160
I kind of try to ignore it that Jessica Rabbit is my mom

1704
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:36,160
and that she cheated on Roger with bugs

1705
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:40,160
or it's like Lola cheated on bugs with Roger.

1706
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,160
I don't know the truth of that.

1707
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:44,160
So I try not to worry about it too much

1708
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,160
because you know, I'm not trying to,

1709
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,160
I don't need, I already have like a familial relationship with them.

1710
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,160
I don't want to fuck it up, you know?

1711
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,160
I don't want to make it weird by being like,

1712
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,160
oh, like taking paternity tests and all that shit, you know?

1713
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:59,160
What the fuck am I on right now?

1714
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:04,160
You know, it's just like, you know, weird family stuff.

1715
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:08,160
Weird family stuff.

1716
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,160
Yeah, or Lola cheated on bugs with Jessica.

1717
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,160
I don't know.

1718
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,160
I don't know how that works.

1719
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,160
There was a rumor that, you know,

1720
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:18,160
on Jessica was packing.

1721
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:19,160
I don't know.

1722
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,160
Okay, we're crazy.

1723
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,160
The chat for 14 of my immortal.

1724
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,160
Random Lord.

1725
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,160
Oh yeah, what the fuck was I doing?

1726
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,160
Oh yeah, playing a game.

1727
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:34,160
I literally just talked for two hours.

1728
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,160
What the fuck?

1729
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:45,160
I didn't even play the fucking game.

1730
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,160
All right.

1731
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:50,160
I need a sip of tea.

1732
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,160
Jessica Rabbit canonically rugged.

1733
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,160
What?

1734
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,160
Yeah, retract that message.

1735
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,160
What the fuck is that?

1736
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:06,160
I should play there is no game like that one.

1737
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,160
And then just like, just talk the other time

1738
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,160
because there's no game because I'm just talking.

1739
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:18,160
Uh, the customer who looked tired.

1740
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,160
You came.

1741
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:20,160
Yeah, I did.

1742
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,160
That's right.

1743
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,160
The customer who came.

1744
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,160
I mean, who looked tired.

1745
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:25,160
I'm here.

1746
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:28,160
It makes me happy.

1747
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:31,160
Oh, are you feeling nervous?

1748
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,160
Is this...

1749
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:35,160
Why are the dudes in the back fucking unlockable characters?

1750
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:39,160
Is this your first time at a place like this?

1751
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,160
Is that guy over there?

1752
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,160
Okay.

1753
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,160
Like he doesn't have a face.

1754
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,160
Don't worry about it.

1755
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,160
Uh, okay.

1756
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:46,160
Well, that's right.

1757
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,160
I've never been here.

1758
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,160
I see.

1759
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,160
Well, then I guess I'll give you a brief explanation

1760
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,160
on how it works because you haven't started

1761
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,160
the fucking game yet.

1762
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,160
It's been two hours.

1763
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,160
I love the dude profile.

1764
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:01,160
It's to give the main character.

1765
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,160
Please.

1766
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,160
I don't know anything.

1767
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,160
So this will help.

1768
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,160
The name of the shop is Bunny Garden,

1769
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:11,160
a fun place to drink.

1770
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,160
We're run.

1771
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:15,160
We're owned by Wonderland Enterprises.

1772
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,160
The CEO is Shibi...

1773
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:18,160
Shut the fuck up.

1774
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:19,160
You can't say her name.

1775
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:20,160
I'm sure you can't say...

1776
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:21,160
Okay, sorry.

1777
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:23,160
Never mind one of the girls said I can't talk about it.

1778
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:24,160
That's all.

1779
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:28,160
Oh, uh, seems like I should understand,

1780
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:29,160
but I don't.

1781
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:32,160
Well, you'll gradually get used to it.

1782
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,160
So it's okay.

1783
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,160
I'll be really happy if you come here lots of times.

1784
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,160
You'll come here...

1785
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:39,160
Lots of times, won't you?

1786
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,160
You'll come...

1787
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:44,160
Here...

1788
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,160
In my Bunny Garden...

1789
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:50,160
Lots of times, right?

1790
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,160
Anyways...

1791
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,160
I agree.

1792
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:01,160
To do that, I have to work hard at my current job

1793
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,160
because I have to take responsibility.

1794
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,160
Well then,

1795
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,160
I want you to be able to do your best

1796
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,160
so I hope I can give you a lot of healing.

1797
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:11,160
Drop your pants!

1798
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,160
This is really good tea.

1799
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:30,160
I'm sorry, I choked a little bit a moment ago.

1800
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:31,160
So sorry.

1801
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,160
Okay.

1802
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,160
What's commence?

1803
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,160
If I feel if I work harder,

1804
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,160
my dick gets hard.

1805
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:46,160
I'll feel better.

1806
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,160
Why did you say it?

1807
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:48,160
Don't worry about it.

1808
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:49,160
It's decided!

1809
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

1810
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,160
I didn't hear your order.

1811
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:54,160
Here you are.

1812
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:55,160
This is the menu.

1813
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,160
Right.

1814
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:58,160
Maybe you'll have a drink.

1815
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,160
You guys got...

1816
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,160
Wait, what's...

1817
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,160
Icy Nade,

1818
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,160
and Sheeby Nade,

1819
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,160
and Amy Nade,

1820
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,160
and Azura Nade,

1821
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:12,160
and Mercy Nade,

1822
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,160
and Strani Nade.

1823
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:16,160
It's in a section called Lemon Nades.

1824
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:18,160
Can you elaborate?

1825
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:21,160
It just says in the description

1826
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:22,160
fresh from the source.

1827
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:23,160
What does that mean?

1828
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:26,160
Sorry, I can't elaborate on the drink menu.

1829
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,160
You'll have to talk to my superior.

1830
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,160
Okay.

1831
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:33,160
I guess I'll just have a normal drink then.

1832
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,160
What drink did you want?

1833
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:40,160
A pricier drink could increase...

1834
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,160
A pricier drink can increase my likability?

1835
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,160
What the fuck?

1836
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:50,160
Can I...

1837
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:51,160
I'll have to use my arrows.

1838
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:52,160
Where's the sound?

1839
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:55,160
Oh, my headphones are turned off.

1840
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:58,160
Excuse me.

1841
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,160
I feel like I need to spend a bag.

1842
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:10,160
Oh, wait, I have to use these.

1843
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,160
Which is the most expensive drink on the menu?

1844
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,160
Jesus fuck.

1845
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:25,160
Bunny trap?

1846
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,160
I'll take the House Lemon Sour.

1847
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:32,160
Oh, so the Immy Nade.

1848
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,160
Yeah, whatever.

1849
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,160
I want to drink something too.

1850
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:38,160
I have to buy you a drink?

1851
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:40,160
Is this what...

1852
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:43,160
like bars are like?

1853
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:45,160
Like some bars are in Japan?

1854
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:47,160
Cause like I've never been to like a maid cafe

1855
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,160
or like any of that stuff.

1856
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,160
Again, I'm very...

1857
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:51,160
I don't have a sort of thing in America.

1858
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,160
Cabaret bars?

1859
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,160
It's a hostess club?

1860
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,160
Yeah, we don't have those around.

1861
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:00,160
That's really actually...

1862
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:01,160
I'm like thinking, I'm like,

1863
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,160
wait, that'd be a good job.

1864
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:05,160
It's like Hooters, except they buy you drinks.

1865
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:07,160
If you don't drink them to drinks,

1866
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,160
they'll pour...

1867
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,160
What if one of the girls gets fucking shit-faced?

1868
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:14,160
Cause if you don't drink them to drinks,

1869
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,160
they'll pour...

1870
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,160
What if one of the girls gets fucking shit-faced?

1871
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:20,160
Cause if you don't drink them to drinks,

1872
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:22,160
cause if you're like hanging out

1873
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:24,160
and drinking with people all the time,

1874
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:28,160
like if like, you have five customers

1875
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:30,160
and they just keep buying you drinks,

1876
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:34,160
like are you limited to like one customer?

1877
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:35,160
Like what is how does...

1878
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:36,160
What's the...

1879
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,160
I need an explanation here.

1880
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:42,160
Actually, yeah,

1881
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:43,160
I remember someone said they were like

1882
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,160
trying to make a VTuber hostess bar.

1883
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:47,160
That would actually be really fucking cool.

1884
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:49,160
Like do you like hologram, Miku?

1885
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:51,160
Except make it a VTuber 3D model.

1886
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:54,160
And I will gladly sit and have a drink with you

1887
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,160
and then I'll probably die

1888
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:57,160
because I can't handle all the call that will.

1889
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:03,160
I'll buy you some...

1890
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,160
a special highball.

1891
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:10,160
Actually, you're a nice lady.

1892
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:11,160
I'm gonna buy you a fine wine.

1893
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,160
Oh, this is great.

1894
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:17,160
I love this.

1895
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,160
Whoa.

1896
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,160
Hello?

1897
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:36,160
I can zoom?

1898
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:43,160
I can give them presents?

1899
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,160
Holy shit.

1900
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:48,160
So being a hostess bar is literally like

1901
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:53,160
being a girlfriend in a hoe without the sex.

1902
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:55,160
And you just gotta be nice to people.

1903
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,160
I would be so fucking good at that.

1904
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:03,160
Cause like I have a very nice and charismatic personality.

1905
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:04,160
Just saying.

1906
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:05,160
Look it.

1907
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:07,160
There's a couple of you guys here.

1908
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,160
It means you like me.

1909
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:13,160
GFE for a night?

1910
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:16,160
Fendom but with interaction?

1911
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,160
No, cause like...

1912
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:21,160
Fendom, like usually the dimes only take, they don't give.

1913
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:33,160
Thank you, Velvet Queen.

1914
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:40,160
Absolute mad lad Velvet Queen with the 127?

1915
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:45,160
I'm literally talking about...

1916
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:48,160
I'm getting panty shots and people are giving me 100 bucks.

1917
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,160
What's wrong with it?

1918
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,160
There's something wrong with this picture.

1919
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:53,160
Thank you, thank you so much.

1920
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:54,160
I'm doing a little heart.

1921
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,160
I'm doing a little heart.

1922
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,160
A little sa-dang-yay for you.

1923
01:51:58,160 --> 01:51:59,160
They bought me a drink.

1924
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:00,160
It was a very expensive drink.

1925
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:01,160
Thank you.

1926
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:09,160
How do I zoom?

1927
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:11,160
How do I zoom?

1928
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:12,160
Let me zoom it.

1929
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:15,160
I'm like fucking a...

1930
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:19,160
I can't even remember the meme.

1931
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,160
I just want to zoom.

1932
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,160
It's chat.

1933
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:25,160
Did you even tell me your name?

1934
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:27,160
I'm getting kind of nervous.

1935
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:32,160
I mean, it's going to be the first time I meet this next customer.

1936
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:34,160
You know I'm right here.

1937
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:37,160
Like I can hear everything you're saying out loud.

1938
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:40,160
My heart feels like it's going to explode from how fast it's racing.

1939
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:42,160
Why are you ignoring me?

1940
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:45,160
Oh, what am I saying?

1941
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:48,160
The purpose of this place is to make customers feel relaxed.

1942
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,160
Not stressed.

1943
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:54,160
Yeah, but you're stressing me out because you're acting fucking crazy talking to yourself.

1944
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:58,160
If I'm in a state like this, I'm sure the customer is going to feel the same.

1945
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:00,160
Come on now, you've got this.

1946
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,160
Bitch, what the fuck are you on?

1947
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:06,160
Sorry, I'm schizophrenic.

1948
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:08,160
Okay, let's start off with the reasonable.

1949
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:09,160
Huh?

1950
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:11,160
The first step in the order is to become friends.

1951
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:15,160
You're the customer, so please go right ahead with everything you've got.

1952
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:19,160
You can't see what I'm doing, so I'm taking my arm.

1953
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:20,160
I'm throwing it over my shoulder.

1954
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:24,160
I'm throwing it in front of myself like I have a giant cock.

1955
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,160
That's my first step.

1956
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:32,160
You like what you see?

1957
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:38,160
Huh?

1958
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:41,160
I mean...

1959
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:46,160
She said, show me what you got, so I showed her what I got.

1960
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:50,160
You're fine, don't worry about it.

1961
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,160
I hurt my elbow.

1962
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,160
Oh my god.

1963
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,160
She's my words carefully.

1964
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:02,160
What a better hug.

1965
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:04,160
What, no hug?

1966
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:08,160
There was a dude at my job that would do that, and I fucking hated him.

1967
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:10,160
He'd be like, where's my hug?

1968
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:12,160
I'm like, non-existent.

1969
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:14,160
Sorry, a customer is calling, bye.

1970
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:18,160
I'm sorry, if you do that to girls, you're fucking annoying.

1971
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:19,160
Where my hug at?

1972
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:25,160
And then, sometimes, because like for me...

1973
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:33,160
So I have OCD and certain like feelings and like pressure and textures.

1974
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:35,160
Maybe I'm just autistic.

1975
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,160
Really bother me.

1976
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:46,160
I don't like to be hugged too much unless I really like you or for like a really close family member or family friend or my parents.

1977
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:53,160
Like I literally will only let like Salem and Olive and my parents hug me and my family members.

1978
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:56,160
But like when like...

1979
01:54:56,160 --> 01:55:03,160
Because I'll say like people are like really touchy-feely and like, I don't know, like I'm just not like that.

1980
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:09,160
Yeah, I'm sorry, physical touch is not my love language.

1981
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:12,160
Naturally as a dom, it's acts of service.

1982
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:16,160
So get on your knees and eat this cushy-coochie.

1983
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:22,160
Madam Desiree Savis?

1984
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:25,160
I need a bell.

1985
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:27,160
I need a bell to ring.

1986
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,160
Do I have a bell?

1987
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:29,160
I know I have a fucking bell.

1988
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:32,160
Well, it's not a bell actually.

1989
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:36,160
It's, I think it's my candle snuffer.

1990
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:37,160
Snuffing?

1991
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:38,160
Let's see where it is.

1992
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:40,160
But it like sounds like a bell.

1993
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:49,160
Oh, it's not dinging.

1994
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:54,160
Usually it makes a ding noise.

1995
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:56,160
Damn it.

1996
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:59,160
Matty perquias dick!

1997
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:02,160
Dick actus once!

1998
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:05,160
Just imagine bell noises, okay?

1999
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,160
Thank you.

2000
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:16,160
Or coochie.

2001
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,160
We don't discriminate in this household.

2002
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:19,160
Okay.

2003
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:23,160
So a toast or something?

2004
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:25,160
That's what I just fucking said.

2005
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:28,160
That's the spirit.

2006
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:30,160
You seem eager to start drinking.

2007
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:32,160
But don't you think sharing each other's names comes first?

2008
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:35,160
Well, by the little bar that's next to your body,

2009
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:37,160
I can kind of surmise your name is Kanna,

2010
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:42,160
or Kanna, or can I eat your pussy out tonight?

2011
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,160
What?

2012
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,160
Never mind.

2013
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:48,160
Anyways, I'd love to know more about you.

2014
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,160
Right.

2015
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,160
My name is Haito Kanna.

2016
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:52,160
Yeah, Kanda.

2017
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:57,160
I will butcher Japanese names.

2018
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:59,160
I apologize to my Japanese friends.

2019
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:04,160
The Vaude staying up!

2020
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:06,160
Relax, the Vaude staying up.

2021
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:08,160
Relax.

2022
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:09,160
Oh, I just remembered,

2023
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:13,160
because I just see someone with Oshimarks in their name

2024
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,160
that aren't mine.

2025
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,160
Fuck you, first of all.

2026
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:16,160
But I don't really blame you,

2027
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:22,160
because my Oshimarks don't work on YouTube.

2028
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:25,160
So, we're going to do a quick tangent.

2029
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:27,160
When I say quick, I mean 30 minutes.

2030
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:32,160
I was going to suggest that we pick

2031
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:34,160
some that are YouTube-friendly.

2032
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:37,160
I forgot to actually see that.

2033
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:39,160
I was going to suggest that we pick

2034
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:41,160
some that are YouTube-friendly.

2035
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:43,160
I forgot to actually see that.

2036
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:48,160
Only 30?

2037
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,160
That's optimistic!

2038
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:53,160
Slow your fucking roll, kid, okay?

2039
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:57,160
Don't disrespect me in my own households.

2040
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:00,160
I'm roping, but yeah.

2041
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:02,160
I know, mercies don't, like,

2042
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,160
mercies scissors don't work.

2043
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:09,160
Your vote is a snail in a tongue.

2044
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:17,160
Yeah, I see, yeah, polar bear doesn't work.

2045
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,160
But, like, bear and ice cube make sense.

2046
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,160
That works.

2047
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,160
Oh!

2048
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:26,160
Since the bunny works,

2049
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:28,160
I will be bold and suggest the heal

2050
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:30,160
and the other bunny.

2051
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:33,160
But the bunny doesn't work.

2052
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:39,160
Is it the bunny face?

2053
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:43,160
Because the bunny, like, body doesn't work.

2054
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:51,160
But, like, try to put the bunny,

2055
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:52,160
because, like, you know,

2056
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:56,160
like, you look at my old videos,

2057
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:59,160
I had the rope in the bunny in my title.

2058
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:00,160
I might have taken it out, actually.

2059
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:01,160
They don't show up.

2060
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:02,160
They just show up as squares.

2061
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,160
So I think the bunny head would work,

2062
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,160
and then the high-heeled shoe would work.

2063
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:12,160
The bunny twins in an act!

2064
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:15,160
That's just the shining.

2065
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:23,160
No, it was the, it was the,

2066
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:25,160
it's the bunny with the body

2067
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:26,160
and the rope.

2068
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,160
They both don't work.

2069
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:28,160
Is it device to shoot?

2070
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:29,160
No.

2071
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:34,160
Because that's,

2072
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:36,160
the second one you posted, Nugget,

2073
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:38,160
isn't an emote, actually.

2074
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:41,160
Like a, like a normal emote, I don't think.

2075
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,160
Okay, here, let's, let's do this together.

2076
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,160
Well, put some in your fucking name,

2077
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:51,160
then we'll see.

2078
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,160
What a fitting game.

2079
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:57,160
All right.

2080
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:58,160
Now I have to pick them.

2081
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,160
Damn, can you even test a working chat?

2082
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:03,160
Yeah, it looks like, see, they're working chat.

2083
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:06,160
But if you put them in your name, doesn't work.

2084
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:10,160
Oshimark can just be the membership icon.

2085
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:12,160
You mean the Gimp Bunny?

2086
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:13,160
I don't...

2087
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:20,160
No, but the, no, I want Oshimarks!

2088
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:21,160
I'm not settling!

2089
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:25,160
A bunny in vomit?

2090
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:27,160
You fell for that.

2091
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:28,160
A bunny in a knife?

2092
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,160
I'm not, no, I would say probably a heart

2093
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:32,160
in a knife for mercy.

2094
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:34,160
I'm gonna say

2095
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:36,160
the gunny, if you will.

2096
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:37,160
Is there, there's only a pistol.

2097
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:39,160
I wish, I wish they had like this water pistol.

2098
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:40,160
I wish they had the old gun back.

2099
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:44,160
I use this account for normal stuff, though.

2100
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:46,160
Well, that's too fucking bad.

2101
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:51,160
I'm not changing my Oshimarks.

2102
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:53,160
Like, this is the only specific to,

2103
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:55,160
actually, you know what?

2104
02:00:57,160 --> 02:00:59,160
Until membership's open,

2105
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:01,160
if you wanna show your support

2106
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,160
and show that you're a harem member,

2107
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:05,160
you can put just the red high-heeled shoe in your name.

2108
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:07,160
So I don't think anybody uses that.

2109
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:10,160
I said, yeah, the red high-heeled shoe would be cool.

2110
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:13,160
Cause I think the red high-heeled shoe works.

2111
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:16,160
And then like some bunny doesn't even,

2112
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:17,160
that can just be anybody.

2113
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:21,160
Yeah, yeah.

2114
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:28,160
Yeah, bunny head, red heel.

2115
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:30,160
Pig.

2116
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,160
Yeah, whatever fucking one works.

2117
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:36,160
But just the red heel, definitely.

2118
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:38,160
Cause that one's obvious.

2119
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:41,160
Some bunny, what's told me?

2120
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,160
A rat?

2121
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:46,160
That would be more emmy.

2122
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:48,160
She got rats.

2123
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:53,160
Yeah, so you can do,

2124
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:56,160
you can do a heel in whatever your heart desires.

2125
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:57,160
What's an Oshimark?

2126
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:59,160
I like to explain it as,

2127
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:01,160
imagine it's a cutie mark.

2128
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:03,160
Of your favorite VTuber.

2129
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,160
But what's a cutie mark?

2130
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,160
It's a little symbol that shows aspects

2131
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:08,160
of the pony's personality.

2132
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:10,160
For example, Twilight Sparkle.

2133
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:12,160
She's purplish, like Twilight.

2134
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:14,160
And there's a sparkler in her name.

2135
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:17,160
So it's like a purply sparkle on her punch.

2136
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:24,160
I've always said that Oshimarks are just cutie marks.

2137
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:25,160
Oshimarks.

2138
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:33,160
Did you put a red heel in a pregnant man?

2139
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,160
That was good.

2140
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:38,160
That was fucking good.

2141
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:39,160
That got me.

2142
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:44,160
Mmm, some pop rocks to eat.

2143
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:50,160
I'm yum.

2144
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,160
What are you looking at me like?

2145
02:02:57,160 --> 02:02:58,160
What the fuck are you doing?

2146
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:02,160
Good night.

2147
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:06,160
No, there's this, I think there's a setting

2148
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:08,160
just to like put it in your name,

2149
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,160
like your display name.

2150
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:14,160
Only if you want to.

2151
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:22,160
Oh, look at you guys with your bunny heel.

2152
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:24,160
Ow, it makes me happy.

2153
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:28,160
Oh my God, that makes me so happy.

2154
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:32,160
I'll add it to my description.

2155
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:35,160
Like if you want to show your support,

2156
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:38,160
here are the YouTube Oshimarks.

2157
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:40,160
And I'll just put like the bunny in the heel.

2158
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,160
Heal in a nose.

2159
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:46,160
Cool.

2160
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,160
My day is made.

2161
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:50,160
Bro, I was so productive today.

2162
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:52,160
I went to the doctor's office.

2163
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:53,160
I paid some bills.

2164
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:55,160
I still haven't done my dishes.

2165
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:00,160
I picked up my mail and my packages.

2166
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,160
I'm streaming.

2167
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:04,160
I got lunch.

2168
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,160
I'm feeling good today.

2169
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,160
I napped for 30 minutes.

2170
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,160
It was more like 15.

2171
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:15,160
These Pop Rocks are so fucking good.

2172
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:17,160
I'm adulting.

2173
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:20,160
Can you play the game now, please?

2174
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:22,160
Can you please play the game?

2175
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:23,160
Shabee.

2176
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:25,160
Shabee, you play the-

2177
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:26,160
Shut the fuck up.

2178
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:31,160
The big kids are talking, the big kids.

2179
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:32,160
The adults are talking.

2180
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:34,160
I just choked in a pop,

2181
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:35,160
almost in a pop socket.

2182
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:37,160
Pop Rock.

2183
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:39,160
Suck my left titties.

2184
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:40,160
Anyways.

2185
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:43,160
You don't need to keep looking at me like that.

2186
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,160
There's a cake.

2187
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:46,160
Pop Rocks are awful.

2188
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:49,160
Nobody asked.

2189
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:52,160
Did anyone ask?

2190
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:53,160
What is that?

2191
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:54,160
Oh, nobody asked.

2192
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:55,160
That's crazy.

2193
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:56,160
Anyways.

2194
02:04:58,160 --> 02:04:59,160
I'm more of a righty guy.

2195
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:04,160
You don't need to keep looking at me like that.

2196
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:06,160
I'm a righty guy.

2197
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:08,160
You don't need to keep looking at me like that.

2198
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:10,160
Oh, sorry.

2199
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:14,160
I wanted to remember your name and face, you see.

2200
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:17,160
So, well, I look like the other two guys in this place.

2201
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:19,160
I'm just a black void.

2202
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:24,160
Yeah, I know, but you know.

2203
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:27,160
There's no need to worry.

2204
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:29,160
I've matched your face to your name now.

2205
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:30,160
But I look-

2206
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:31,160
I'm an unlockable character.

2207
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:33,160
Okay, it's my turn now.

2208
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:35,160
Oh, alright.

2209
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:36,160
My name's Kana.

2210
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:38,160
I don't mind if you give me a nickname,

2211
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:40,160
but I sure you hope to-

2212
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:41,160
Yeah.

2213
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,160
Alright.

2214
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:44,160
I'll call you Conti.

2215
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:46,160
Because you're a cunt.

2216
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:48,160
You talk to yourself a lot.

2217
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:50,160
I'll do my best to match your name to your face then.

2218
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:51,160
Kana-Chan.

2219
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,160
Yeah.

2220
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:56,160
Gonna come on her chin.

2221
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:57,160
What was that?

2222
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,160
Oh, sorry.

2223
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,160
Kana-Chan.

2224
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:01,160
Hey, stop it.

2225
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:03,160
You're making me all flustered.

2226
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:07,160
I- I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at.

2227
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:10,160
Well, you got massive fucking jugs.

2228
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:11,160
So...

2229
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:16,160
I suppose there's some things you learned from first-hand experience.

2230
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:20,160
Yup, I guess I got a little smarter from this whole situation.

2231
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:22,160
What are you talking about?

2232
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:25,160
Well, tell me more about yourself, Haidoku.

2233
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:29,160
Ugh, I messed up real bad at work recently,

2234
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:32,160
and because of that, the boss fired me.

2235
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:34,160
So I've been assisting a friend at his-

2236
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:35,160
I wonder what he did for his job.

2237
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:37,160
Like, what did he fuck up?

2238
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:43,160
If you ever do a compilation of streams, this will definitely make it.

2239
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:47,160
An intrusive thoughts are waiting today.

2240
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:50,160
His nickname is longer than her real name.

2241
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:55,160
It's more like you're cleaning and not making more dirty dishes to clean dishes up.

2242
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:57,160
Yeah, it's because I had dishes in the dishwasher,

2243
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:59,160
I still need to take them out and put the other dishes away,

2244
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:01,160
and then put the new ones in the dishwasher.

2245
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:05,160
I stole someone's sandwich.

2246
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:07,160
Probably forgot to use MLA format.

2247
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:08,160
That's what I'm going with.

2248
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:10,160
I need burp.

2249
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:15,160
My god.

2250
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:17,160
I really like the like-

2251
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:21,160
like the stuff coming from the ceiling that the-

2252
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:24,160
all the drinks are on, that's actually really fucking cool.

2253
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:26,160
Like the- the place in here is pretty sick.

2254
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:28,160
Oh, that sounds rough.

2255
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:30,160
Anyways, wanna buy me another drink?

2256
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:34,160
If I was in your shoes, I probably wouldn't even be able to eat.

2257
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:36,160
You should just kill yourself.

2258
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:41,160
What?

2259
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:44,160
Uh, though, I- sorry, I meant to say, though I'm sure words

2260
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:46,160
can't express how awful you must feel.

2261
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:48,160
I'm so sorry.

2262
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:50,160
Did you just tell me to kill me?

2263
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:51,160
No!

2264
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:52,160
Silly.

2265
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:54,160
Alright, I- I got it.

2266
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:56,160
I'm going to do my absolute best

2267
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,160
in order for you to get back on your feet.

2268
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:00,160
What the fuck?

2269
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:02,160
Are you gonna do- are you gonna give me a job?

2270
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:06,160
The time you spend here will be-

2271
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:07,160
I'm- I'm gonna ignore that.

2272
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:09,160
The time you spend here will be a constant smile.

2273
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:11,160
I can assure you that much.

2274
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:14,160
I hope we get a long haitoku.

2275
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:17,160
Can you keep drinking haitoku?

2276
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:18,160
Don't push yourself, okay?

2277
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:21,160
I have like five other guys I need to hang out with.

2278
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:23,160
And we're gonna get some burgers and fries later.

2279
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,160
I can't- should I keep talking to her?

2280
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:40,160
This game sucks, dude.

2281
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:48,160
No, no.

2282
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:50,160
No, no.

2283
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:52,160
That's funny.

2284
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:54,160
Okay.

2285
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:57,160
Wow, is it already this late?

2286
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:58,160
I'll head back home.

2287
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,160
Jesus fuck.

2288
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:04,160
Thank you for today.

2289
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:05,160
See you soon.

2290
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:08,160
Yeah, thanks for everything.

2291
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:09,160
See you soon.

2292
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:13,160
Mom, Dad, I have a girlfriend.

2293
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:15,160
Yeah, she works at a hostess bar

2294
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:17,160
and her pay like 4500 yen to see her,

2295
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:19,160
but she's really sweet.

2296
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:20,160
She gives me greater life advice.

2297
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:24,160
I could talk to my cat for free.

2298
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:26,160
Save the Rizzing Brothers?

2299
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:27,160
Okay, got you.

2300
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:29,160
It was such a nice place

2301
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:30,160
and the customer service was great.

2302
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,160
Maybe I'll go there for the time being.

2303
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:38,160
I was sick.

2304
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,160
Do I need- oh.

2305
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:46,160
Okay.

2306
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:48,160
Cool.

2307
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:58,160
I can spend 6k yen on socks?

2308
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:06,160
Yeah, I'm buying girl socks

2309
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:08,160
and then I'm gonna make her wear them

2310
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:10,160
and then give them back to me.

2311
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:13,160
Duh.

2312
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:19,160
I don't want to sniff her fucking socks.

2313
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:24,160
Alright, what's the calendar?

2314
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:27,160
Make a girl out to dinner first.

2315
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:28,160
Oh!

2316
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,160
Thank you, Ninka.

2317
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:36,160
I love it.

2318
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:41,160
I have like really bad-

2319
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:43,160
because when I watch movies, I do this too.

2320
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:47,160
I really bad impulse like to say stupid shit

2321
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:50,160
during a movie or like a TV show that I'm watching

2322
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:55,160
and I do it a lot and I'm like-

2323
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:58,160
I remember thinking and like also when I play games

2324
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:02,160
and then like seeing that people like did that on

2325
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:04,160
like for streamers and for YouTube,

2326
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:06,160
I'm like why the fuck don't I become a streamer?

2327
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:07,160
Like I do this on a daily.

2328
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,160
I do this to my- like I just talk to my cats.

2329
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:12,160
I stream to my cats.

2330
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,160
All of them.

2331
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:15,160
I can sleep.

2332
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:20,160
I can go on vacation.

2333
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:24,160
Does that- are we fucking on vacation?

2334
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:29,160
Why are there only three girls?

2335
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:33,160
Two of them look the same.

2336
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:37,160
They're dressed like they're-

2337
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:41,160
Bunny Power Rangers.

2338
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,160
I just-

2339
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:43,160
Tyrannactyl!

2340
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,160
Tyrannosaurus!

2341
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:47,160
I never get the fucking blue one.

2342
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:50,160
Macedon!

2343
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:51,160
Is it Macedon?

2344
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:53,160
What time for-

2345
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:54,160
Oh!

2346
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:55,160
Hi, Rhea.

2347
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:57,160
Hi, Mamosa.

2348
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:02,160
Oh, sorry.

2349
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:03,160
Triceratops!

2350
02:12:04,160 --> 02:12:06,160
Yeah, the leaders from Pokemon Go.

2351
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:09,160
This one's me.

2352
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:12,160
Me with ponytails.

2353
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,160
This one

2354
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:16,160
is-

2355
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:19,160
None of the girls in our group look like that.

2356
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:21,160
This is Emmy because they have the same pigtails.

2357
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:23,160
No, I wouldn't-

2358
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:24,160
Never mind.

2359
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:25,160
That's not-

2360
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:27,160
None of these girls are us because

2361
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:29,160
I've been making some-

2362
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:30,160
If this was Emmy,

2363
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:32,160
I'd be making serious savers from really stupid shit.

2364
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:34,160
Although,

2365
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:36,160
Telling someone to kill themselves.

2366
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:37,160
Telling someone to kill themselves.

2367
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:39,160
It's very on-gagged for her.

2368
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:41,160
How's it going?

2369
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:42,160
How was the stream?

2370
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:46,160
My sweet, sweet Yume Plus girls.

2371
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:48,160
My sweet girls.

2372
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:50,160
So, so cute.

2373
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:51,160
So silly.

2374
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:55,160
Guys, please check out Yume Plus and

2375
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:59,160
the girls because

2376
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:00,160
they are-

2377
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:02,160
Mamosa is

2378
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:04,160
unhinged just like me.

2379
02:13:05,160 --> 02:13:07,160
She's trying to give me her lotion tonic.

2380
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:08,160
See? There you go.

2381
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:15,160
They're such cute girls.

2382
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:18,160
I'm honestly surprised they're not like

2383
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:21,160
fucking ginormous.

2384
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,160
They should be.

2385
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:24,160
I love watching their streams.

2386
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:26,160
They don't know, but I creep on their streams

2387
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:29,160
and I like to giggle at them a lot.

2388
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:31,160
I just lurk.

2389
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:36,160
Help!

2390
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:39,160
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching you.

2391
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:42,160
I'm watching you, Mamosa.

2392
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:44,160
I'm gonna drink you like a Mamosa.

2393
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:45,160
Okay, anyways, let's gamble.

2394
02:13:46,160 --> 02:13:47,160
Gambling up to ten times.

2395
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,160
If I was a true gambler,

2396
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:50,160
I would have no limit.

2397
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:53,160
I'm leaving!

2398
02:13:55,160 --> 02:13:56,160
Okay, I'm staying.

2399
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,160
Yeah, pull up a chair.

2400
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:01,160
Pull up a chair, baby girl.

2401
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:03,160
Pull up a chair, baby girl.

2402
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:06,160
Come hang out in my bunny garden.

2403
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:08,160
Yeah.

2404
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:12,160
Can we play Blackjack?

2405
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:17,160
What the hell is this?

2406
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:21,160
Is this a Skull King from Inscription?

2407
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:23,160
Gambling!

2408
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:28,160
Wait!

2409
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:31,160
I don't even fucking play a game.

2410
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:33,160
I just lose money?

2411
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:37,160
Are you serious?

2412
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:40,160
I'm never fucking using this again.

2413
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:41,160
Why would I ever gamble?

2414
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:42,160
What is the point?

2415
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:44,160
Now I have less money.

2416
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:49,160
But like, I wish,

2417
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:50,160
I thought there'd be like a cute mini game

2418
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:51,160
where I play like Blackjack

2419
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:52,160
or like poker

2420
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:54,160
or like fucking Solitaire.

2421
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:55,160
I don't know.

2422
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:57,160
What the hell, man?

2423
02:14:57,160 --> 02:14:58,160
I've been cheated.

2424
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:02,160
You can save Skum till you win.

2425
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:03,160
No, I'm not going to do that.

2426
02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:06,160
I was lost 20 bucks!

2427
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:09,160
Let's do it again.

2428
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:14,160
Can I like,

2429
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:15,160
can I just like, skip ahead?

2430
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:17,160
I don't care about this fucking splash screen.

2431
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,160
No!

2432
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:34,160
No!

2433
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:41,160
No!

2434
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:43,160
Alright, let's do it again.

2435
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:49,160
I just used 31k yet!

2436
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:52,160
Run it back!

2437
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,160
Run it back!

2438
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:55,160
Run me my, oh fuck, I lost again.

2439
02:15:58,160 --> 02:15:59,160
Okay, no.

2440
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:06,160
This sucks!

2441
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:11,160
Just skip, fuck, you guys are like,

2442
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:12,160
I love this game!

2443
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:15,160
No, I don't!

2444
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:18,160
I feel like we're going to debt.

2445
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:23,160
I remember I went to a casino with $50

2446
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:24,160
and I lost it all

2447
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:25,160
and I cried.

2448
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:27,160
It was only $50.

2449
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:30,160
It wasn't even my $50.

2450
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:32,160
It was my, it was Olive's

2451
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:34,160
because we were celebrating

2452
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:36,160
that she got a gig in an acting thing

2453
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:38,160
and she was with her friends to a casino.

2454
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:39,160
But I was like,

2455
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:40,160
I was just like broke

2456
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:41,160
because like,

2457
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:44,160
I had like a lot of health bills and shit

2458
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,160
and so she was like,

2459
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:46,160
gave me 50 bucks

2460
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:47,160
and I was like,

2461
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:48,160
ah, yay!

2462
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:49,160
And I was like,

2463
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:50,160
I'm going to flip this

2464
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:51,160
and give you your 50 bucks back.

2465
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:52,160
I lost it.

2466
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:56,160
I will never gamble.

2467
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:58,160
That shit is terrible.

2468
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:04,160
Well, hello there.

2469
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:07,160
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

2470
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:08,160
Yes.

2471
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:11,160
Thanks for visiting me today.

2472
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:13,160
I don't want to talk to you!

2473
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:17,160
Can I talk to one of the other girls?

2474
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:22,160
Can I just buy you a drink?

2475
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,160
Give me a gin and tonic.

2476
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:27,160
Yeah.

2477
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:29,160
Can I have some too?

2478
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:31,160
No bitch, I'm broke.

2479
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:32,160
Fine.

2480
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:34,160
I'll buy you some water

2481
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:35,160
with ice.

2482
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:36,160
How about that?

2483
02:17:37,160 --> 02:17:38,160
You're getting less semi.

2484
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:40,160
You're getting this whatever the fuck this is.

2485
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:42,160
Pay some music.

2486
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:43,160
Okay.

2487
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:45,160
You don't have to relax, okay?

2488
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:46,160
Keep your panties on.

2489
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:48,160
Turn around.

2490
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:50,160
Oh.

2491
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:54,160
What?

2492
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:57,160
Are you serious?

2493
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:03,160
If I don't buy, I swap girl?

2494
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:08,160
Damn.

2495
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:14,160
Well, I don't want to give my present to you.

2496
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:15,160
Because I don't know why,

2497
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:16,160
but you kind of just bother me

2498
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:19,160
and your boobs are like breathing.

2499
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:21,160
How does that even work?

2500
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:22,160
I'm breathing right now.

2501
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:24,160
I'm looking down at my boobs.

2502
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:26,160
My boobs don't separate

2503
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:29,160
and have breath in life of their own.

2504
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:39,160
This isn't working.

2505
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:40,160
Their boobs have lungs.

2506
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:41,160
You know, I don't breathe.

2507
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:47,160
She's got a bigger chest.

2508
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:48,160
My chest is as big as hers.

2509
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:50,160
I'm not even fucking joking.

2510
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:55,160
Her brain is there too.

2511
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:56,160
When I go for a jog,

2512
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:58,160
my tit punches me in the face.

2513
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:00,160
Okay.

2514
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:02,160
Proof?

2515
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,160
You want proof?

2516
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:05,160
Boom.

2517
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:07,160
There's your proof.

2518
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:10,160
There's your proof.

2519
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:12,160
Anyways.

2520
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:14,160
Cut the music!

2521
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:15,160
Put it back on!

2522
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,160
Uh, there's food?

2523
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:25,160
Aw.

2524
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:28,160
I haven't eaten in a couple days.

2525
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:31,160
Do you want some edamame?

2526
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:38,160
Huh? What's wrong?

2527
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:39,160
You seem puzzled.

2528
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:41,160
It just seems like you're a broke ass bitch

2529
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:42,160
and you only got edamame.

2530
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:43,160
So like,

2531
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:46,160
why couldn't you have gotten me like sushi or something?

2532
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:48,160
Huh?

2533
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,160
Got it!

2534
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:52,160
Haitaku!

2535
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:53,160
You're Haitaku!

2536
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:54,160
Wow!

2537
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:56,160
You forgot my name.

2538
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:01,160
Yeah, so that's what you got.

2539
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:02,160
You forgot my name

2540
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:04,160
and was trying desperately to remember it.

2541
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:05,160
That's not...

2542
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:06,160
I don't like you.

2543
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:07,160
I don't like you.

2544
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:09,160
I don't like you.

2545
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,160
Give me another girl.

2546
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:13,160
Customer service here sucks.

2547
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:16,160
Can I speak to your manager?

2548
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:17,160
Can I speak to your manager?

2549
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:19,160
Bring me the manager.

2550
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:21,160
Bring me the fucking manager.

2551
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:26,160
I want to be a dick.

2552
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:27,160
Can I be a dick and just say hi?

2553
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:28,160
I'm Kaido.

2554
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:30,160
No, because then she's just going to remember my name wrong.

2555
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:32,160
Well, I'm never going to talk to her again,

2556
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:33,160
so actually I'm Kaido.

2557
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:37,160
I was one letter off.

2558
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:39,160
I mean, sorry about that.

2559
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:40,160
Where are you giggling?

2560
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:42,160
Wait, you tricked me!

2561
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:45,160
Anyways, dick, don't worry about me.

2562
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:47,160
I'll never forget your name anymore.

2563
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:48,160
So don't worry, okay?

2564
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:49,160
Too late.

2565
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:51,160
I am wanting to talk to the girl in blue,

2566
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:53,160
so hurry up.

2567
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:56,160
Thanks, but no thanks.

2568
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:58,160
I'm really sure it's hard for you to remember

2569
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:00,160
every customer's name like that.

2570
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:01,160
Yeah.

2571
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:03,160
Guys kind of all look the same,

2572
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:04,160
like unlockable characters,

2573
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:06,160
and I wish you had name tags or something.

2574
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:07,160
You know, something cute,

2575
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:09,160
like what you see a kindergartner wearing.

2576
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:12,160
Sorry.

2577
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:14,160
I'm only joking, of course.

2578
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:15,160
I'm a lollicon.

2579
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:17,160
I'm a pro in my field.

2580
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:19,160
Remembering names is my specialty.

2581
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:25,160
Well, you did remember my name at the same time.

2582
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:28,160
Oh, I'm off, so you're still here.

2583
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,160
Hahaha!

2584
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:43,160
I'm actually being faceless fuck.

2585
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:49,160
Well, you did seem to remember my name

2586
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:50,160
within seconds before.

2587
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:53,160
Seems like you're doing great for my eyes.

2588
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:55,160
Weird, you don't have any.

2589
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:56,160
Yeah, I know.

2590
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:58,160
Aw, thanks.

2591
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:59,160
You really are kind.

2592
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:01,160
Aren't you Haidokun?

2593
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:03,160
It's Kaido,

2594
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:05,160
like the Vocaloid.

2595
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:07,160
I'll make sure to never forget your name.

2596
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:10,160
Haidokun, should I get more drinks?

2597
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:12,160
I want to keep talking to you more.

2598
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:16,160
That's a no for me, dog.

2599
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:18,160
When did it get so late?

2600
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:20,160
I guess I'll head back soon.

2601
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:26,160
Thank you for today.

2602
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:27,160
You're fucking broke.

2603
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:28,160
See you soon.

2604
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:29,160
You can't buy anything.

2605
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:31,160
Yeah, thanks for everything.

2606
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:32,160
See you soon.

2607
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:34,160
We're so poor.

2608
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,160
Can you get kicked out of Bunny Garden?

2609
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:37,160
That would actually be really funny.

2610
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:40,160
Yeah, I got paid!

2611
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:42,160
Let's fucking go!

2612
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:43,160
I got paid!

2613
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:46,160
You know what time it is?

2614
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:49,160
Let's fucking go!

2615
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:56,160
With eyes, only one eye is glowing.

2616
02:22:58,160 --> 02:22:59,160
It's white.

2617
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:07,160
I'm buying you all drinks.

2618
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:09,160
The whole garden gets drinks!

2619
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:11,160
What do you want?

2620
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:15,160
No.

2621
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:24,160
We're so back, bros.

2622
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:25,160
So fucking back.

2623
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:27,160
So fucking back.

2624
02:23:27,160 --> 02:23:30,160
90% of gamblers quit before hitting a big...

2625
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:32,160
Shut up.

2626
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:36,160
Thanks, boy!

2627
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:42,160
I came up with a really bad joke.

2628
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:45,160
I'm going to say it anyways.

2629
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:47,160
So I'm going to need your mom to come over.

2630
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:49,160
And I'm going to trim her hedge.

2631
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:50,160
That's all I'm going to say.

2632
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:52,160
That's all I'm going to say.

2633
02:23:58,160 --> 02:23:59,160
Wow.

2634
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:00,160
Games.

2635
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:01,160
So fun.

2636
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:05,160
Oh!

2637
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:09,160
Cast members may be away on Saturdays.

2638
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:10,160
Yes!

2639
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:12,160
Okay, what voice?

2640
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:13,160
What voice for her?

2641
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,160
What voice?

2642
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:16,160
She's kind of Gyaru.

2643
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:17,160
Should we give her a valley accent?

2644
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:21,160
After we plant the seed?

2645
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:22,160
Exactly.

2646
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:23,160
Exactly.

2647
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:24,160
This guy fucking gets it.

2648
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:26,160
Peppy?

2649
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:27,160
Peppy Valley girl?

2650
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:28,160
Okay.

2651
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:29,160
Hi!

2652
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:30,160
What drink did you want?

2653
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:32,160
Uh, your hot as fuck.

2654
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:34,160
I'm going to get you something nice.

2655
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:35,160
I'm going to treat you.

2656
02:24:36,160 --> 02:24:37,160
Sorry.

2657
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:38,160
It's like my keyboard.

2658
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:40,160
I just won big at gambling.

2659
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:44,160
So I'm going to have a buddy trap.

2660
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:46,160
Because I like traps.

2661
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:47,160
What was that?

2662
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:48,160
Don't worry about it.

2663
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:52,160
Okay, whatever.

2664
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:54,160
Can I have some too?

2665
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:56,160
Yeah, I got you baby girl.

2666
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:59,160
I'm going to get you the bunny punch

2667
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:01,160
because I'm going to punch your fart box

2668
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:02,160
with my tongue later.

2669
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:03,160
Huh?

2670
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:04,160
Don't worry about it.

2671
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:06,160
I'm sorry.

2672
02:25:06,160 --> 02:25:08,160
I thought you were going to get it.

2673
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:09,160
You wanted to play hide and seek.

2674
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:10,160
I'm sorry.

2675
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,160
I'm sorry.

2676
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:26,160
I'm sorry.

2677
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:28,160
I am sorry.

2678
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:29,160
I'm sorry.

2679
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:30,160
I'm sorry.

2680
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:31,160
I'm sorry.

2681
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:32,160
I'm sorry.

2682
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:54,800
I want to tongue punch your fart box.

2683
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:55,800
Man.

2684
02:25:55,800 --> 02:26:03,240
Cause I'm gonna just like make clips of just this one, this one, uh, stream, I'm just like

2685
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:14,760
all the dumb ass shit I'm saying, uh, hold on, take a sip.

2686
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:22,640
I was in your tea, it's literally only chamomile in mint, in lavender, I'm eating, I'm drinking

2687
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:28,000
the sleepy time tea, uh, that you lovely bitches got me off the throne, thank you so much, it's

2688
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,000
my favorite tea.

2689
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,920
Usually I take it to fall asleep, but I don't feel like taking the throat coat for my throat,

2690
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:36,600
cause I've been talking this entire week, and last week.

2691
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:38,240
So I'm drinking this instead, it's very tasty.

2692
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:39,240
It's not caffeinated.

2693
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:40,240
How am I holding up?

2694
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:41,240
I'm holding up good.

2695
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:42,240
I'm having a great time.

2696
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:43,240
I can take a shot.

2697
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:44,240
You guys want me, should we take a shot?

2698
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:45,240
You guys want to take a shot?

2699
02:26:45,240 --> 02:26:46,240
You guys want to take a shot?

2700
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:47,240
I got Tito's.

2701
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:54,920
Should we get a lady titi?

2702
02:26:54,920 --> 02:27:01,540
Should we make this a drunk stream?

2703
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:02,540
Sounds good.

2704
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:04,400
Take a shot, take a shot.

2705
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:06,680
Part in the jar, what?

2706
02:27:06,680 --> 02:27:10,280
Just shot of Tito's.

2707
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:13,080
I don't have a lime to chase it though.

2708
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:16,400
Let's do it, let's fucking do it.

2709
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:18,120
Oh my god, Rina, I was rolled over you.

2710
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:20,320
Hi, what's up?

2711
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:21,160
Can I help you?

2712
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:23,720
Hey.

2713
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:25,480
Oh, what's up?

2714
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:28,440
Hey, mamas, how you doing?

2715
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:30,220
Why are you wet?

2716
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:32,960
Her chest is wet,

2717
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:34,800
cause she sometimes like sticks her whole entire

2718
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:36,960
fucking body into the water bowl.

2719
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:37,960
A water fountain.

2720
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:42,600
Here, you want some cat purrs?

2721
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:44,440
Hold on, let me switch off the desktop audio

2722
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:45,840
so you can hear her purring.

2723
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:48,480
Cat purrs and shots?

2724
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,280
Yeah, she's my big mama.

2725
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:07,560
You trying to stop me from taking a shot?

2726
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:09,280
Cause you're not gonna, Rina.

2727
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:12,600
Anyways, let me just get up and be in worse fear.

2728
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:17,600
I just thought of that side talk.

2729
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:22,080
Do you remember like the big gong guy,

2730
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:24,480
like the same side talk guys?

2731
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:26,680
I just think of that fucking,

2732
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:28,240
the black dude on the street,

2733
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:29,880
is like talking to a homeless chick.

2734
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:31,280
He's like, you want a shot?

2735
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:32,240
You want a shot?

2736
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:33,080
You want a shot?

2737
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:36,720
I fucking love that clip.

2738
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:37,720
So funny, buddy.

2739
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:40,040
Oh my god.

2740
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:44,040
Wow, do I have a shot glass?

2741
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:48,280
I only got a little bit of...

2742
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:59,160
We drinking straight from the bottle, bros.

2743
02:28:59,160 --> 02:29:01,680
Cause I don't throw in my shot glass one.

2744
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:04,520
You want a shot?

2745
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:05,440
You want a shot?

2746
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:08,880
Drink from my Oshie mark, like my shoe?

2747
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,480
Can you guess what it is?

2748
02:29:13,480 --> 02:29:14,760
Just Tito's vodka.

2749
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:18,680
80 proof, 40% alcohol.

2750
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:27,480
Oh dear lord heaven, we are so Barak Obama.

2751
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:28,680
Hello, Barak Obama.

2752
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:31,520
You want a shot?

2753
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:32,360
You want a shot?

2754
02:29:32,360 --> 02:29:34,720
I want you to look up that clip right now

2755
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:37,400
and picture me saying that to you.

2756
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:41,040
And that, you know, like that,

2757
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:45,560
that like Pennywise the clown,

2758
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:48,400
when he takes a, he's about to take a drink of something

2759
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:50,240
and he just like flicks the cap off.

2760
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:52,440
I can't do it.

2761
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:53,560
Oh, perfect.

2762
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:55,360
Oh shit, I dropped it.

2763
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:56,320
And then he just swigs it.

2764
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:57,600
That's what I'm gonna do.

2765
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:01,760
Woo!

2766
02:30:07,480 --> 02:30:11,640
Oh my God, that tingled my fucking nipples.

2767
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:12,720
What the fuck?

2768
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:15,720
You want a shot?

2769
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:16,880
You want a shot?

2770
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:20,160
Oh, I need a moment.

2771
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:27,520
Fuck yeah!

2772
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:32,120
Oh, aren't you funny?

2773
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:32,960
Oh, aren't you funny?

2774
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:34,280
Charlie spurred it $4.20.

2775
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:35,400
Thank you, Charlie.

2776
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:38,120
Madam, I offer all my worldly possessions

2777
02:30:38,120 --> 02:30:39,520
to you smiling face.

2778
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:44,600
All right, can I have your clothes?

2779
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:45,440
Give me your shoes.

2780
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:46,280
I like your shoes.

2781
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:47,400
Are we the same size?

2782
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:48,240
Yeah, I'll take those two.

2783
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:49,080
Thank you.

2784
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:49,920
Appreciate it.

2785
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:50,760
Thank you, Charlie.

2786
02:30:56,920 --> 02:31:00,560
Ooh, I'm gonna sleep well tonight.

2787
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:07,640
You want a shot?

2788
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:08,960
You want a shot?

2789
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:09,960
You want a shot?

2790
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:10,960
You want a shot?

2791
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:16,960
Pew, pew!

2792
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:17,960
Pew, pew!

2793
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:18,960
Pew, pew!

2794
02:31:19,960 --> 02:31:21,960
Oh, that was a Tito's burp.

2795
02:31:25,400 --> 02:31:27,400
I need your clothes in return.

2796
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:28,240
No.

2797
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,160
I own you.

2798
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:33,640
I own you, okay?

2799
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:34,640
In your mouth.

2800
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:38,040
I'm almost, I fucking love you.

2801
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:40,120
I'm almost a reveal bunch.

2802
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:41,440
Match up my energy right now.

2803
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:47,040
That's what I was referencing.

2804
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:48,280
I was referencing PsyTalk.

2805
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:53,320
You can't pull out the gun every time you drink.

2806
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:55,080
Who fucking said I can't?

2807
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:57,920
I do what I want, when I want it.

2808
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:00,600
I'm now eating applesauce.

2809
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:04,600
Me eating a bogey squeeze.

2810
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:09,160
If you're gonna drink with me,

2811
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:11,200
make sure you hydrate and eat something.

2812
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:17,400
This is America.

2813
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:18,560
Don't get you stripping.

2814
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:20,840
Stripping, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

2815
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:25,080
I'm so happy because today I discovered

2816
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:27,240
when I was listening to the new Caitranada album

2817
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:30,040
that challenged Gambino and Caitranada

2818
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:31,760
made a fucking song together

2819
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:33,800
and I literally was praying

2820
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:36,840
to the gods above in the universe for that

2821
02:32:36,840 --> 02:32:39,040
and it happened and it was great.

2822
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:40,360
And then they did a pink pantherist

2823
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:41,880
and I was like, holy fucking shit.

2824
02:32:46,120 --> 02:32:47,240
PsyTalk vid.

2825
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,960
Hmm.

2826
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:50,800
Probably.

2827
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:52,640
Baby a triple.

2828
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:56,120
Anonymous tipped $3.33.

2829
02:32:56,120 --> 02:32:58,880
He said face red heart shape.

2830
02:32:58,880 --> 02:32:59,720
Bebe.

2831
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:03,760
I think probably.

2832
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:06,120
Okay, no, pray for me to be debt free.

2833
02:33:06,120 --> 02:33:07,360
Pray, I'll pray for all of us.

2834
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:08,200
I'm praying.

2835
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:11,600
Oh universe.

2836
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:15,120
Oh, God's above, please let us all be debt free.

2837
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:18,280
Please let us all win the lottery.

2838
02:33:18,280 --> 02:33:19,120
Thank you.

2839
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:21,680
Inshallah.

2840
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:23,520
God willing.

2841
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:26,480
I fucking love pink panthers.

2842
02:33:27,080 --> 02:33:27,920
Amen.

2843
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,880
And so it shall be.

2844
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:32,040
And so it might be.

2845
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:36,880
I forget the Hebrew way to say amen.

2846
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:38,480
Or is that, is amen already Hebrew?

2847
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:39,480
I don't fucking know.

2848
02:33:40,480 --> 02:33:42,480
That is a prison and gambling is the key.

2849
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:43,480
Time to gamble.

2850
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:47,040
Pray that taxes are abolished.

2851
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:47,880
No taxes.

2852
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:49,240
Actually, no, tax are rich.

2853
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:53,440
All right, take another swig.

2854
02:33:53,440 --> 02:33:54,280
Hold on.

2855
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:56,640
Any music, any music, any music,

2856
02:33:56,640 --> 02:33:58,240
any music for a second.

2857
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:01,840
I mean, I don't know.

2858
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:04,840
Sorry, I'm gonna be a 12-kiss for a second.

2859
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:13,840
I get claimed, but I only do a couple seconds.

2860
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:18,840
I'm doing it from my phone.

2861
02:34:19,600 --> 02:34:21,940
I'm doing it from my phone.

2862
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:29,400
AHHHHHH!!

2863
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:31,400
AHHHHHHHH!!

2864
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:37,400
UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH!

2865
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:39,400
We're the capitol.

2866
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:42,400
Mmm.

2867
02:34:43,400 --> 02:34:44,400
Hold on.

2868
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:47,400
Wait, no!

2869
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:55,840
Okay, we're good.

2870
02:34:55,840 --> 02:35:04,840
Howdy mate, how's it going?

2871
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:06,840
How you doing?

2872
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:07,840
Stop!

2873
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:10,840
I can't find the cat.

2874
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:11,840
No cat.

2875
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:16,840
Go away, girl, go!

2876
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:21,840
I'm scared, did you just...

2877
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:22,840
What the fuck, what do you mean?

2878
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:25,840
What the fuck is going on?

2879
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:26,840
What?

2880
02:35:26,840 --> 02:35:27,840
What?

2881
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:35,840
Okay, I took two swigs of my Tito's.

2882
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:38,840
I am feeling a whore.

2883
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:39,840
Here's a present.

2884
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:41,840
I just met you, but this is crazy.

2885
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:42,840
Here's some socks.

2886
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:45,840
So wear them, maybe.

2887
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:48,840
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

2888
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:50,840
I just want you to like it.

2889
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:53,840
Please wear them.

2890
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:57,840
I'm gonna buy one to wear next.

2891
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:00,840
I got something good.

2892
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:01,840
Wait, hold on.

2893
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:06,840
Wait a sec, you're pretty cute, but why are you curled up in a ball, sir?

2894
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:11,840
How the fuck am I curled up in a ball at the counter, but okay.

2895
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:12,840
What's wrong?

2896
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:14,840
You must be nervous.

2897
02:36:14,840 --> 02:36:15,840
That's no good.

2898
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:18,840
Getting nervous over me is just a waste of energy.

2899
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:21,840
Oh, hello, my name is Hito Kanda.

2900
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:23,840
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

2901
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:25,840
That's disgusting.

2902
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:27,840
Don't burp in my face again.

2903
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:30,840
You started introducing yourself, you fucking weirdo.

2904
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:33,840
Well then, I will too.

2905
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:35,840
Hello, I am Rin.

2906
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:36,840
Sorry to trouble you.

2907
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:37,840
What am I doing?

2908
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:39,840
Is this how it's supposed to go?

2909
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:43,840
So, what do you do?

2910
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:44,840
Hi Chan.

2911
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:47,840
Do you call me how she calls me Chan?

2912
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:53,840
Well, right now I'm assisting an acquaintance with their job.

2913
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:56,840
But until recently...

2914
02:36:56,840 --> 02:36:58,840
Thank you, Charlie.

2915
02:36:58,840 --> 02:36:59,840
Thank you, Charlie.

2916
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:01,840
It's too late.

2917
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:03,840
I wear an eye patch.

2918
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:06,840
IRL and my medical bills are astronomical.

2919
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:10,840
I think the prayer is too late.

2920
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:12,840
Jesus fuck.

2921
02:37:12,840 --> 02:37:14,840
I'm sorry.

2922
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:19,840
I hope that can be recovered for you.

2923
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:24,840
So fuck.

2924
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:28,840
Uh...

2925
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:30,840
Yeah, stop.

2926
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:33,840
There are even tags on your pyres, bro.

2927
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:36,840
You're so fucking out of poker for that.

2928
02:37:36,840 --> 02:37:39,840
Honestly, eye patches are badass, though.

2929
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:45,840
There's this one governor, I think, in America that was a former military veteran.

2930
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:47,840
He wears an eye patch and he looks fucking cool.

2931
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:49,840
And you can pretend you're solid snakes sometimes.

2932
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:52,840
So...

2933
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:54,840
That's good. I hope it goes well.

2934
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:56,840
Thank you for the tip.

2935
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:58,840
I need to scratch my nose.

2936
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:01,840
But until recently, I was employed at a company.

2937
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:05,840
However, due to a plethora of mistakes, I was terminated.

2938
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:08,840
Is there even a word for plethora in Japanese?

2939
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:10,840
Hang on. Hi, Tom.

2940
02:38:10,840 --> 02:38:14,840
I can't keep up with all that formal speech. Stop being a fucking weirdo.

2941
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:18,840
I'd be super grateful if you could just, like, talk normally, please.

2942
02:38:18,840 --> 02:38:20,840
Like, what is this?

2943
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:22,840
I'm moving my hands around. You can't tell.

2944
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:25,840
Yes, it's called plethora.

2945
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:28,840
Oh, really? I'll drop the pretenses then.

2946
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:31,840
Thank you. You're such a nice guy, hi, Tom.

2947
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:35,840
Even if you're too formal and weird sometimes, it's their loss for firing you.

2948
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:37,840
You're better off without them.

2949
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:40,840
No, they treated me pretty well.

2950
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:42,840
But I'm kidding, bye, okay now.

2951
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:45,840
I gambled the other day and I did well.

2952
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:48,840
Wow, you're really something, hi, Tom.

2953
02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:51,840
You don't badmouth them even after getting fired.

2954
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:54,840
I respect that. You know, you're for real, for real.

2955
02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:58,840
No cap. Facts, no printer, ink.

2956
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:00,840
What the fuck did you just say?

2957
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:03,840
You're a stand-up guy. You must get that a lot, huh?

2958
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:09,840
I don't get that at all.

2959
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:12,840
They do. Let me hear some more.

2960
02:39:12,840 --> 02:39:14,840
Let me hear some more.

2961
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:16,840
Can you feed my ego?

2962
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:18,840
Can you feed my ego, please?

2963
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:22,840
You're such a kind, upstanding person, hi, Chen.

2964
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:26,840
It's true. I just met you. We've only talked once.

2965
02:39:26,840 --> 02:39:29,840
You're really kind of fucking weird, but sure.

2966
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:33,840
You know, you're so kind and upstanding.

2967
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:35,840
I already said that.

2968
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:37,840
You already said that.

2969
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:40,840
Yeah, but you're kind and upstanding, okay?

2970
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:42,840
Oh, hey, let me tell you something.

2971
02:39:42,840 --> 02:39:47,840
I'm serious. Well, I'm always serious, but I'm seriously, serious.

2972
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:50,840
Are you okay?

2973
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:53,840
A new people is really important, right? In life, I mean.

2974
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:57,840
Online, you know.

2975
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:00,840
So I'm really grateful to have met you, hi, Chen.

2976
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:05,840
I may be far from perfect, but I'll still do the very best I can.

2977
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:08,840
Hope you're ready. I'm gonna sit on your face.

2978
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:10,840
So what?

2979
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:13,840
Um, sorry, I didn't mean to say that. Ellipses.

2980
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:16,840
How embarrassing. What am I saying?

2981
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:19,840
Sit on your face. That was so forward of me.

2982
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:22,840
Well, you get the idea. Did you catch all that?

2983
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:25,840
I'm not saying it again. I'm gonna sit on your face.

2984
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:28,840
By the way, the other girls here will also sit on your face,

2985
02:40:28,840 --> 02:40:32,840
and they're really nice too. I think you'll like this shop a lot.

2986
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:37,840
If you find that I'm not your type after talking to me a few times,

2987
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:40,840
feel free to slide up to the next row and sit,

2988
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:43,840
or you can have us both at once.

2989
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:49,840
I'm not the type of girl who's bothered by that sort of thing to be, you know,

2990
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:53,840
with another girl and a guy. I'm bi, you know.

2991
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:57,840
I'm pretty fluid. I don't believe in labels, actually.

2992
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:00,840
Uh, can you, can we change the subject?

2993
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:04,840
Fine. Well, on the other hand, if you do find that I'm your type,

2994
02:41:04,840 --> 02:41:07,840
it'd make me pretty happy.

2995
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,840
Well, I'll leave it at that.

2996
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:13,840
So, like, do you want to have a threesome or...?

2997
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:17,840
I didn't pay for that kind of service.

2998
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:20,840
It's on the house. Just say fucking yes.

2999
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:23,840
I don't think I'm comfortable with that.

3000
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:25,840
Sorry.

3001
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:30,840
Um, anyways, I look forward to serving you or whatever, I guess.

3002
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:35,840
Don't fucking threesome with me and the girl in the blue fucking bitch.

3003
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:38,840
Bet you watch his worst head tie.

3004
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:39,840
What did you say?

3005
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:44,840
I can! How about drinks? Do you want a bit more? Should I get you something?

3006
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:46,840
Uh, no, I'm good.

3007
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:48,840
When did it get so late?

3008
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:50,840
I should head back soon.

3009
02:42:00,840 --> 02:42:02,840
I don't know.

3010
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:07,840
If you can please the cast members in the shop.

3011
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:10,840
I'm gonna leave my eyebrows.

3012
02:42:10,840 --> 02:42:13,840
They'll see you out in a good mood when you leave.

3013
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:17,840
Haito, who is sent off, is more motivated to work and had...

3014
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:19,840
What the fuck?

3015
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:24,840
Thank you for today! See you soon!

3016
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:26,840
Yeah, thank you for today.

3017
02:42:26,840 --> 02:42:30,840
So, about that threesome, so I'm meeting the other girl, like, in like an hour?

3018
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:32,840
Did you want to, like...

3019
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:35,840
I gotta get home. I have work tomorrow.

3020
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:36,840
But it's Sunday.

3021
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:38,840
Uh, yeah.

3022
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:39,840
Over time.

3023
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:41,840
Later.

3024
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:48,840
I don't know if you guys heard her meow.

3025
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:50,840
She went, meow.

3026
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:52,840
She's in my lap.

3027
02:42:57,840 --> 02:43:00,840
I got to drink some delicious alcohol and have fun conversations.

3028
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:02,840
Now I'm motivated for work.

3029
02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:10,840
Um...

3030
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:18,840
Okay, I don't know what the fuck that is.

3031
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:20,840
Let's buy another thing.

3032
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:27,840
I'm gonna buy some macarons for the blue black-haired girl.

3033
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:38,840
Now's my time to rest up and recover.

3034
02:43:38,840 --> 02:43:41,840
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

3035
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:46,840
Oh, fuck, it's this bitch again.

3036
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:49,840
What? Oh, you came! Thanks!

3037
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:50,840
I...

3038
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:52,840
Clean up after yourself next time.

3039
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:54,840
That's all I'm gonna say.

3040
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:56,840
Um, what drink did you want?

3041
02:43:57,840 --> 02:43:59,840
I don't want to hang out with you.

3042
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:01,840
Can I, like...

3043
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:03,840
Not buy anything?

3044
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:05,840
Cause I don't want to talk to you.

3045
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:07,840
I'm gonna get a blueberry liquor.

3046
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:09,840
Cause that sounds tasty.

3047
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:13,840
Can I have some too? No bitch.

3048
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:15,840
I want to talk to the girl in blue.

3049
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:21,840
A customer called me so I better get going.

3050
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:23,840
No one else is fucking here.

3051
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:26,840
I get it, you're embarrassed.

3052
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:28,840
I want to talk to the blue girl.

3053
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:31,840
Can I...

3054
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:33,840
She just fucking walked in place.

3055
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:35,840
I don't want to talk to you either!

3056
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:37,840
Let me talk to her!

3057
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:43,840
Okay, I'll just get some food.

3058
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:48,840
Damn.

3059
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:50,840
This makes me hungry.

3060
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:52,840
I need to eat dinner.

3061
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:00,840
What is a geo?

3062
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:01,840
Ailo?

3063
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:03,840
A jello?

3064
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:13,840
You want some cheese and crackers?

3065
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:15,840
You want some salami?

3066
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:17,840
I can give you a hard salami.

3067
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:19,840
Um...

3068
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:21,840
Uh, like, no thanks.

3069
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:22,840
Alright, fine.

3070
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:24,840
I guess we'll just be french fries.

3071
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:29,840
Thank God, this tastes so good!

3072
02:45:30,840 --> 02:45:32,840
I'm glad you came back, thinkies!

3073
02:45:32,840 --> 02:45:34,840
Have you been good?

3074
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:37,840
Yeah, you seem like you're in a good mood too, ranchon.

3075
02:45:38,840 --> 02:45:39,840
How do you know my name?

3076
02:45:39,840 --> 02:45:41,840
I don't... oh no, she did introduce herself, nevermind.

3077
02:45:42,840 --> 02:45:43,840
Girl dinner.

3078
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:46,840
When do you get the sushi off of her?

3079
02:45:46,840 --> 02:45:48,840
Ooh, so like...

3080
02:45:48,840 --> 02:45:51,840
Is there gonna be an option on the menu where I can eat sushi off your body?

3081
02:45:51,840 --> 02:45:53,840
Sorry, I hit the microphone.

3082
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:56,840
Um, we don't do that store to service here.

3083
02:45:56,840 --> 02:45:58,840
This place fucking blows!

3084
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:01,840
Where's my happy ending?

3085
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:04,840
What good would I be if I couldn't put on a smile?

3086
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:06,840
I'm ignoring that.

3087
02:46:06,840 --> 02:46:07,840
Hmm?

3088
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:09,840
Yeah, my neighbors are walking by.

3089
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:12,840
You actually don't look like you're feeling so great yourself.

3090
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:14,840
Really?

3091
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:16,840
I'm feeling fine physically today.

3092
02:46:16,840 --> 02:46:18,840
And I don't have any problems.

3093
02:46:18,840 --> 02:46:20,840
Hmm, you look shitty.

3094
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:21,840
That's all I'm gonna say, buddy.

3095
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:23,840
Did you shower?

3096
02:46:23,840 --> 02:46:25,840
You smell like you haven't showered.

3097
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:26,840
You sure?

3098
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:28,840
Nope, but you're definitely not feeling good.

3099
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:30,840
Not at all.

3100
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:33,840
This is a bad omen, you know.

3101
02:46:33,840 --> 02:46:34,840
Get it?

3102
02:46:34,840 --> 02:46:36,840
Today's fortune?

3103
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:39,840
You know what would make the bad omen go away?

3104
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:42,840
If you buy me a better drink.

3105
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:45,840
Or some sushi.

3106
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:49,840
Or if you have that threesome I keep talking to you about, you know, I never mind you smell bad.

3107
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:52,840
Me and girl in blue don't wanna fuck you anyways.

3108
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:58,840
When does this should be real-time phantom stream?

3109
02:46:58,840 --> 02:47:00,840
See?

3110
02:47:00,840 --> 02:47:04,840
Japanese honorifics and the F-boy voice is so good.

3111
02:47:04,840 --> 02:47:06,840
Can I start saying thankies?

3112
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:08,840
Oh my god, thankies!

3113
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:12,840
But hey sir, you're lucky.

3114
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:14,840
In fact, I can judge based on your name.

3115
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:15,840
Wanna try?

3116
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:19,840
Oh fuck, you're one of those numerology astrology bitches.

3117
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:20,840
Fuck, crazy bitch.

3118
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:21,840
What?

3119
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:23,840
Nothing, sure.

3120
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:26,840
Like, fortune telling with names?

3121
02:47:26,840 --> 02:47:29,840
Sure, I'll give it a try.

3122
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:31,840
Okay, okay, I know your name already.

3123
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:34,840
You told me what it was last time, right?

3124
02:47:34,840 --> 02:47:40,840
Did you forget my fucking name and you're just stalling for me to say it?

3125
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:43,840
Yeah, I introduce myself to you.

3126
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:48,840
Right, I know it, I know it, I know it, but I need to know how it's spelled.

3127
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:50,840
Let's see the fortune telling.

3128
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:52,840
You are so full of shit.

3129
02:47:52,840 --> 02:47:54,840
No, I'm not.

3130
02:47:54,840 --> 02:47:56,840
I pooped this morning.

3131
02:47:56,840 --> 02:48:00,840
How do you spell your name in kanji?

3132
02:48:04,840 --> 02:48:06,840
I am haito, it's kan-

3133
02:48:06,840 --> 02:48:08,840
Why would I just say my last name?

3134
02:48:08,840 --> 02:48:10,840
Why would I say my filming name?

3135
02:48:10,840 --> 02:48:13,840
I could be an ass and say it's spelled in hiragana.

3136
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:18,840
I'll tease her.

3137
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:21,840
I want my birth chart.

3138
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:24,840
Like, I don't want a free threesome bra.

3139
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:27,840
I'm like uber uncomfortable with that.

3140
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:30,840
Oh, like, I don't want a threesome bra.

3141
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:32,840
I'm like uber uncomfortable with that.

3142
02:48:32,840 --> 02:48:35,840
I only do threesome with my bros.

3143
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:37,840
I feel tower.

3144
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:39,840
Each other.

3145
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:40,840
Huh?

3146
02:48:40,840 --> 02:48:41,840
Nothing.

3147
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:43,840
It's kanda.

3148
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:48,840
Right, but what I want to know is your first name.

3149
02:48:48,840 --> 02:48:52,840
I don't think I called you by your first name last time.

3150
02:48:52,840 --> 02:48:56,840
You literally gave me a female honorific because you're a bitch.

3151
02:48:56,840 --> 02:49:00,840
First, the character is for cup in person, then dry in field.

3152
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:02,840
That's how you spell haito kanda.

3153
02:49:02,840 --> 02:49:04,840
Remember now?

3154
02:49:04,840 --> 02:49:06,840
You got me, huh?

3155
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:08,840
I totally forgot your name.

3156
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:10,840
I'm really sorry.

3157
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:13,840
Okay, I found a way online.

3158
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:14,840
I'm one of those.

3159
02:49:14,840 --> 02:49:18,840
Oh my god, witch talk is so helpful to learn someone's name after you forget it.

3160
02:49:18,840 --> 02:49:21,840
It's said to offer to tell their fortune with it.

3161
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:22,840
Clever, huh?

3162
02:49:22,840 --> 02:49:24,840
But how did you figure it out?

3163
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:29,840
Was it acting suspicious?

3164
02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:32,840
These girls are annoying me.

3165
02:49:32,840 --> 02:49:36,840
You seem like the type of person who can't tell a lie, French Anne,

3166
02:49:36,840 --> 02:49:39,840
but you kind of just technically lied by a mission.

3167
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:42,840
It was written all your face how you were acting.

3168
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:43,840
I get it.

3169
02:49:43,840 --> 02:49:47,840
People usually tell me they can read me like an open book.

3170
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:49,840
I live honestly.

3171
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:52,840
It's so tiring to cover up stuff with lies.

3172
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:57,840
It's easier just to be honest and then apologize when you get scolded.

3173
02:49:57,840 --> 02:49:58,840
I'm sorry.

3174
02:49:58,840 --> 02:49:59,840
Hi, Chan.

3175
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:01,840
You told me your name, but I forgot it.

3176
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:03,840
And then I tried to pull the wool over your eyes.

3177
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:05,840
I'm really sorry.

3178
02:50:05,840 --> 02:50:10,840
So what are you going to do to make up for it?

3179
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:13,840
What do you mean?

3180
02:50:13,840 --> 02:50:15,840
I'd like my happy ending, please.

3181
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:18,840
I'd like to order one happy ending.

3182
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:20,840
Get on your knees.

3183
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:21,840
Come on.

3184
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:22,840
No, I can't.

3185
02:50:22,840 --> 02:50:24,840
We're at work.

3186
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:27,840
I'm asking politely.

3187
02:50:27,840 --> 02:50:29,840
I know where you live.

3188
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:30,840
Okay.

3189
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:33,840
Can I do it later?

3190
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:34,840
Fine.

3191
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:37,840
Sorry, I got...

3192
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:52,840
I'm sorry.

3193
02:50:52,840 --> 02:50:54,840
I forgot where I was.

3194
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:56,840
Hido just took over me.

3195
02:50:56,840 --> 02:50:59,840
I don't even...

3196
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:00,840
This va...

3197
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:02,840
Why would the va be dead?

3198
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:04,840
Well, aren't you funny?

3199
02:51:04,840 --> 02:51:06,840
Thank you, Anonymous.

3200
02:51:06,840 --> 02:51:07,840
Appreciate you.

3201
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:08,840
Man, that's crazy.

3202
02:51:08,840 --> 02:51:10,840
Even more money for the lovely Madden Sheehan.

3203
02:51:10,840 --> 02:51:14,840
Man, that's crazy.

3204
02:51:14,840 --> 02:51:15,840
You want the type ending?

3205
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:16,840
I don't know.

3206
02:51:16,840 --> 02:51:18,840
I know what it is.

3207
02:51:18,840 --> 02:51:19,840
I don't think it was Hido.

3208
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:26,840
I said hi to.

3209
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:30,840
I never thought I wanted to be in top of this game, but here we are.

3210
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:32,840
I can't tell if it's from the game or what it is.

3211
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:35,840
I'm probably not actually watching.

3212
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:36,840
Stalker is.

3213
02:51:36,840 --> 02:51:40,840
I learned from Mercy.

3214
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:44,840
Make myself a little bit bigger.

3215
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:47,840
There we go.

3216
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:48,840
Block that girl's ass.

3217
02:51:48,840 --> 02:51:49,840
You guys can't see.

3218
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:53,840
Only I can see.

3219
02:51:53,840 --> 02:51:54,840
I scare you?

3220
02:51:54,840 --> 02:51:55,840
It's good.

3221
02:51:55,840 --> 02:51:57,840
You should be scared.

3222
02:51:57,840 --> 02:51:58,840
It's all right.

3223
02:51:58,840 --> 02:52:00,840
She didn't bother me at all.

3224
02:52:00,840 --> 02:52:01,840
For real?

3225
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:02,840
Yay.

3226
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:09,840
Well, then let's get back and have some fun.

3227
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:13,840
So lay back.

3228
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:17,840
I'll find all and butt in your pants for you.

3229
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:20,840
Wow.

3230
02:52:20,840 --> 02:52:22,840
That's really small.

3231
02:52:22,840 --> 02:52:24,840
Hey, I'm just.

3232
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:25,840
It's just.

3233
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:27,840
I'm not worked up yet.

3234
02:52:27,840 --> 02:52:28,840
Okay.

3235
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:33,840
All right, well.

3236
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:38,840
Here it goes.

3237
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:48,840
It's cold in here.

3238
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:54,840
Sir, it's heated to 73 degrees in here.

3239
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:56,840
You're sweating.

3240
02:52:56,840 --> 02:53:01,840
Yeah, I will.

3241
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:03,840
That's really pathetic.

3242
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:04,840
All right.

3243
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:08,840
Fuck you.

3244
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:11,840
I'm just gonna fuck it.

3245
02:53:11,840 --> 02:53:17,840
Well, I'll go extra hard today to make up for my screw up with your names.

3246
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:20,840
I won't insult you anymore.

3247
02:53:20,840 --> 02:53:21,840
You're still drinking.

3248
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:23,840
Hi, Chan.

3249
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:24,840
Drinking to forget.

3250
02:53:24,840 --> 02:53:26,840
Careful not to overdo it.

3251
02:53:26,840 --> 02:53:27,840
Okay.

3252
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:29,840
Please, someone get this guy out of here.

3253
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:32,840
His dick is so small.

3254
02:53:32,840 --> 02:53:34,840
I'm leaving.

3255
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:35,840
Wow.

3256
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:36,840
It's already this way.

3257
02:53:36,840 --> 02:53:37,840
Wipes tears from face.

3258
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:38,840
Oh, are you?

3259
02:53:38,840 --> 02:53:39,840
I'm at home.

3260
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:41,840
Charlie spur tipped four dollars and 20 cents.

3261
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:42,840
Thank you again, Charlie.

3262
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:43,840
No, it's average sized.

3263
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:44,840
I swear.

3264
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:46,840
Don't make fun of me, madam.

3265
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:49,840
Loudly crying.

3266
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:53,840
Why are you guys so tiny?

3267
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:59,840
How is anybody supposed to work with that?

3268
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:05,840
I'll head back home.

3269
02:54:05,840 --> 02:54:08,840
Bigger when you pull on it.

3270
02:54:08,840 --> 02:54:10,840
Thank you for today.

3271
02:54:10,840 --> 02:54:12,840
I have to brush my teeth.

3272
02:54:12,840 --> 02:54:13,840
Taste it like cigarettes.

3273
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:16,840
See you soon.

3274
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:17,840
Yeah.

3275
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:19,840
Thanks for everything.

3276
02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:21,840
Didn't even get to come.

3277
02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:30,840
See you soon.

3278
02:54:30,840 --> 02:54:33,840
Oh, fuck.

3279
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:38,840
Oh, you know what this means.

3280
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:40,840
I wish this had more banger music.

3281
02:54:40,840 --> 02:54:54,840
Oh, banger music, guys.

3282
02:54:54,840 --> 02:54:55,840
Okay.

3283
02:54:55,840 --> 02:54:57,840
Sometimes the eyes glow and sometimes they don't.

3284
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:59,840
When it's red, it means I lost.

3285
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:00,840
Oh, fuck.

3286
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:02,840
We're going to do it again.

3287
02:55:02,840 --> 02:55:04,840
We got money to spend.

3288
02:55:04,840 --> 02:55:06,840
Oh, when it glows one eye, we win.

3289
02:55:06,840 --> 02:55:07,840
I'm pretty sure.

3290
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:11,840
It turns white or not.

3291
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:14,840
It does not.

3292
02:55:14,840 --> 02:55:15,840
Oh, I did win.

3293
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:17,840
Yeah.

3294
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:21,840
Let's do it again.

3295
02:55:21,840 --> 02:55:24,840
Something more impressive when you measure in millimeters.

3296
02:55:24,840 --> 02:55:26,840
I lost again.

3297
02:55:26,840 --> 02:55:28,840
Oh, baby.

3298
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:29,840
Oh, baby.

3299
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:30,840
A triple.

3300
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:32,840
$3.33.

3301
02:55:32,840 --> 02:55:33,840
Thank you.

3302
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:34,840
Just a tip.

3303
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:35,840
Thank you for the tip.

3304
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:37,840
Thank you for the tip.

3305
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:40,840
I lost again.

3306
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:42,840
God damn it.

3307
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:46,840
I won.

3308
02:55:46,840 --> 02:55:47,840
I didn't win that much though.

3309
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:48,840
Okay.

3310
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:53,840
If you get the one red glowing eye and white screen, you win big.

3311
02:55:53,840 --> 02:55:58,840
But if you just get a no glowing eyes and white screen, you kind of win a little bit.

3312
02:55:58,840 --> 02:56:02,840
But if you get two glowing red eyes, you lost badly.

3313
02:56:02,840 --> 02:56:11,840
And if you get no glowing red eyes, you lost a small amount.

3314
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:12,840
One red glowing eye.

3315
02:56:12,840 --> 02:56:13,840
It's lost like a medium amount.

3316
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:14,840
Okay.

3317
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:16,840
Oh, baby.

3318
02:56:16,840 --> 02:56:20,840
A triple.

3319
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:23,840
It should be just like me when the high energy drinks longer does it.

3320
02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:24,840
Oh my God.

3321
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:29,840
I need to feel alive.

3322
02:56:29,840 --> 02:56:30,840
I know.

3323
02:56:30,840 --> 02:56:31,840
I need to gain the system.

3324
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:32,840
Fuck that.

3325
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:34,840
We're not gaming the system.

3326
02:56:34,840 --> 02:56:36,840
I didn't read that.

3327
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:38,840
It's fine.

3328
02:56:38,840 --> 02:56:43,840
No, I want to talk to the blue girl.

3329
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:46,840
Get these bitches out of my face.

3330
02:56:46,840 --> 02:56:47,840
Oh, you came.

3331
02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:48,840
I'm glad.

3332
02:56:48,840 --> 02:56:51,840
I have to change my outfit now.

3333
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:56,840
What drink did you want?

3334
02:56:56,840 --> 02:56:59,840
What are you buying?

3335
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:00,840
What are you selling?

3336
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:04,840
I'm feeling crazy.

3337
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:06,840
Can I have some too?

3338
02:57:06,840 --> 02:57:09,840
Are we splitting it?

3339
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:10,840
Fine.

3340
02:57:10,840 --> 02:57:11,840
I'll get you.

3341
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:17,840
I'll get you a highball.

3342
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:18,840
It tastes amazing.

3343
02:57:18,840 --> 02:57:23,840
I love this.

3344
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:26,840
Are you wearing the same panties?

3345
02:57:26,840 --> 02:57:28,840
Girl, change your underwear.

3346
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:35,840
I'll give you the macarons, I guess.

3347
02:57:35,840 --> 02:57:38,840
Here you go.

3348
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:41,840
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

3349
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:44,840
I swear I didn't put razors in them.

3350
02:57:44,840 --> 02:57:46,840
I swear.

3351
02:57:46,840 --> 02:57:47,840
Just don't look.

3352
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:49,840
Just close your eyes when you eat them.

3353
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:51,840
I hope you like it.

3354
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:53,840
Wow, thanks.

3355
02:57:53,840 --> 02:57:55,840
I'll take care of...

3356
02:58:08,840 --> 02:58:13,840
How'd those get in there?

3357
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:17,840
Why did you put razors in this?

3358
02:58:17,840 --> 02:58:18,840
You good?

3359
02:58:18,840 --> 02:58:20,840
Did nobody get my bit?

3360
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:22,840
They weren't paying attention.

3361
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:23,840
You seem happy.

3362
02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:25,840
Did something happen?

3363
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:28,840
Did you guys think I actually hurt myself?

3364
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:30,840
Well, you came all this way to...

3365
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:31,840
Oh, sorry.

3366
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:33,840
Frog in my throat.

3367
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:35,840
Well, you came all this way to visit me.

3368
02:58:35,840 --> 02:58:37,840
Of course I'm happy.

3369
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:41,840
Thanks, but you seem much happier than usual.

3370
02:58:41,840 --> 02:58:42,840
I'm not.

3371
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:47,840
I just swallowed a razor, but we have medical concerns, so I'll be okay.

3372
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:53,840
Maybe it's because I really got some time to relax during my time off recently.

3373
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:57,840
You used your days off to the fullest, then.

3374
02:58:57,840 --> 02:59:00,840
Did you go shopping?

3375
02:59:00,840 --> 02:59:03,840
I mostly shop online these days.

3376
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:09,840
I'm a neat, except I need to go to this job so I can make money,

3377
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:12,840
because I like to play gotcha.

3378
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:13,840
Why are you telling me all this?

3379
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:15,840
Because you fucking asked.

3380
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:19,840
But sometimes going around different stores and looking at what they have

3381
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:21,840
makes me feel super excited.

3382
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:26,840
I played with my dog for the whole day less.

3383
02:59:26,840 --> 02:59:29,840
Naughty, naughty, you teasing me?

3384
02:59:29,840 --> 02:59:33,840
Naughty, naughty.

3385
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:36,840
Oh, you have a dog?

3386
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:38,840
Oh, hi, Meryl.

3387
02:59:38,840 --> 02:59:48,840
Meryl.

3388
02:59:48,840 --> 02:59:53,840
She plays Blue Archive.

3389
02:59:53,840 --> 02:59:57,840
Hello.

3390
02:59:57,840 --> 02:59:59,840
Hello, Meryl.

3391
02:59:59,840 --> 03:00:04,840
My sweet little, cute, fishy.

3392
03:00:04,840 --> 03:00:15,540
Uh-huh, he's a chihuahua, he's a Chihuahua called Wawa, you mean a Chihuahua?

3393
03:00:15,540 --> 03:00:19,620
Yeah, whatever, he's super cute.

3394
03:00:19,620 --> 03:00:23,900
And when you call him Wawa Chin, he waxes his tail and comes to you.

3395
03:00:23,900 --> 03:00:28,060
When he sleeps, it's always next to me too.

3396
03:00:28,060 --> 03:00:32,540
He loves walks too, so I take him to this really big park near my place whenever I get

3397
03:00:32,540 --> 03:00:33,540
a dig off.

3398
03:00:33,740 --> 03:00:36,980
That's what we did last time too.

3399
03:00:36,980 --> 03:00:38,540
So you just hang out with your dog?

3400
03:00:38,540 --> 03:00:39,540
Yeah.

3401
03:00:39,540 --> 03:00:41,900
That sounds great or whatever.

3402
03:00:41,900 --> 03:00:44,140
I love dogs too.

3403
03:00:44,140 --> 03:00:45,140
Really?

3404
03:00:45,140 --> 03:00:49,140
Yeah, I have a husky golden retriever mix.

3405
03:00:49,140 --> 03:00:52,140
That's fucked.

3406
03:00:52,140 --> 03:00:58,820
Well, I hope you give Wawa Chin a nice pat if you ever come around.

3407
03:00:58,820 --> 03:01:01,740
I'm sure you'll end up joining his company too.

3408
03:01:01,740 --> 03:01:07,740
No, she blame it on the alcohol.

3409
03:01:07,740 --> 03:01:12,940
We know her routine, we can go mercy mode now.

3410
03:01:12,940 --> 03:01:14,940
I know, she's giving up a lot of information.

3411
03:01:14,940 --> 03:01:17,940
No, no, no, no, no.

3412
03:01:17,940 --> 03:01:21,940
That's why her color is red.

3413
03:01:21,940 --> 03:01:22,940
Oh my god.

3414
03:01:22,940 --> 03:01:25,340
Do you think he'd be fine to run?

3415
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:26,340
Why are you?

3416
03:01:26,340 --> 03:01:31,700
This is like the third time I've talked to you and you're like, I need to meet my

3417
03:01:31,700 --> 03:01:32,700
dog.

3418
03:01:32,700 --> 03:01:35,100
Do you think he'd be fine around me though?

3419
03:01:35,100 --> 03:01:40,540
I wonder if he'll think I was trying to take his master away from him because I have a

3420
03:01:40,540 --> 03:01:42,980
question to ask you.

3421
03:01:42,980 --> 03:01:47,700
Will you be my master or my mistress?

3422
03:01:47,700 --> 03:01:48,700
What?

3423
03:01:48,700 --> 03:01:49,700
Never mind.

3424
03:01:49,700 --> 03:01:53,700
How are those socks?

3425
03:01:53,700 --> 03:01:56,700
You gave them to the other girl.

3426
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:57,700
Who knows?

3427
03:01:57,700 --> 03:01:59,100
That could happen.

3428
03:01:59,100 --> 03:02:02,400
Wawa Chin loves me so much after all.

3429
03:02:02,400 --> 03:02:04,100
You're trying to seal me away.

3430
03:02:04,100 --> 03:02:05,100
Huh?

3431
03:02:05,100 --> 03:02:06,100
What's wrong?

3432
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:09,100
I'm just trying to buy your affections.

3433
03:02:09,100 --> 03:02:11,400
Uh, nothing at all.

3434
03:02:11,400 --> 03:02:13,500
I'm feeling a little sweaty right now actually.

3435
03:02:13,500 --> 03:02:16,100
God, I wonder what's wrong with me.

3436
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:17,100
Ugh.

3437
03:02:17,100 --> 03:02:18,100
Are you good?

3438
03:02:18,100 --> 03:02:19,500
Sorry, it's my lush.

3439
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:24,100
I mean, you want a drink?

3440
03:02:24,100 --> 03:02:28,100
Uh, I think I'm good.

3441
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:31,100
Is your dog like chocolate?

3442
03:02:39,100 --> 03:02:41,100
Oh, she came and said hi to me.

3443
03:02:41,100 --> 03:02:44,100
I'll be waiting for you, so please come again.

3444
03:02:44,100 --> 03:02:46,100
Yeah, thank you for today.

3445
03:02:46,100 --> 03:02:48,100
Fucking weirdo.

3446
03:02:49,100 --> 03:02:52,100
I hear her boobs jiggle when she waves.

3447
03:02:52,100 --> 03:02:54,100
Like, your boob- wait, actually.

3448
03:02:54,100 --> 03:02:55,100
I'm waving my hand.

3449
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:57,100
Are my boobs jiggling?

3450
03:02:57,100 --> 03:02:58,100
Hold it.

3451
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:01,100
What's that buzzing noise?

3452
03:03:01,100 --> 03:03:03,100
Don't worry about it.

3453
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:07,100
It's air conditioning.

3454
03:03:07,100 --> 03:03:09,100
It's the AC.

3455
03:03:13,100 --> 03:03:16,100
Okay, we had a good fun conversation.

3456
03:03:16,100 --> 03:03:19,100
I'm looking forward to going to work now.

3457
03:03:24,100 --> 03:03:26,100
Can I, like, what is this thing?

3458
03:03:26,100 --> 03:03:28,100
Okay, I don't know what that means.

3459
03:03:28,100 --> 03:03:30,100
Um, I should save.

3460
03:03:30,100 --> 03:03:31,100
I'll save.

3461
03:03:33,100 --> 03:03:35,100
Like, how do they dance in the corner?

3462
03:03:37,100 --> 03:03:38,100
Um.

3463
03:03:40,100 --> 03:03:43,100
Okay, there's not a lot to do in this game,

3464
03:03:43,100 --> 03:03:45,100
and it's kind of annoying.

3465
03:03:45,100 --> 03:03:48,100
I'm like, uh, okay, so I get the gifts, I talk.

3466
03:03:48,100 --> 03:03:50,100
Is that really it?

3467
03:03:53,100 --> 03:03:55,100
I don't think AC sounds like that.

3468
03:03:55,100 --> 03:03:57,100
Don't worry about it.

3469
03:03:58,100 --> 03:04:00,100
Come on, give me white screen.

3470
03:04:00,100 --> 03:04:01,100
Fuck.

3471
03:04:02,100 --> 03:04:03,100
What should I lose?

3472
03:04:03,100 --> 03:04:04,100
Oh!

3473
03:04:04,100 --> 03:04:06,100
Oh, give me a red screen and I run?

3474
03:04:06,100 --> 03:04:07,100
Okay.

3475
03:04:07,100 --> 03:04:10,100
Okay, okay, my strat is totally wrong then.

3476
03:04:10,100 --> 03:04:12,100
Usually, I thought the thing would give an indicator,

3477
03:04:12,100 --> 03:04:14,100
but it really doesn't.

3478
03:04:22,100 --> 03:04:24,100
Bro, what the f-

3479
03:04:25,100 --> 03:04:26,100
Okay.

3480
03:04:37,100 --> 03:04:38,100
Okay.

3481
03:04:38,100 --> 03:04:39,100
That's fine.

3482
03:04:41,100 --> 03:04:43,100
No longer yippee.

3483
03:04:43,100 --> 03:04:46,100
Uh, buy some perfume,

3484
03:04:46,100 --> 03:04:49,100
because I want to know what she smells like,

3485
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:52,100
and so I can buy the same perfume and we can,

3486
03:04:52,100 --> 03:04:55,100
I can spray it on my pillowcase

3487
03:04:55,100 --> 03:04:57,100
and pretend I'm sleeping next to her.

3488
03:04:57,100 --> 03:04:58,100
What should I drink today?

3489
03:04:58,100 --> 03:05:00,100
Beer, wine, champagne?

3490
03:05:00,100 --> 03:05:01,100
Let's just get in there first.

3491
03:05:01,100 --> 03:05:02,100
Go!

3492
03:05:03,100 --> 03:05:04,100
Sorry, jumpscare.

3493
03:05:05,100 --> 03:05:09,100
Please, can I talk to the girl in blue?

3494
03:05:11,100 --> 03:05:13,100
Thanks for visiting me today.

3495
03:05:13,100 --> 03:05:15,100
Can I please talk to that bitch over there?

3496
03:05:15,100 --> 03:05:16,100
It's all I want.

3497
03:05:18,100 --> 03:05:20,100
She has a fatter ass than you.

3498
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:21,100
Um, okay.

3499
03:05:21,100 --> 03:05:23,100
Well, what drink did you want?

3500
03:05:24,100 --> 03:05:26,100
Uh, I'm feeling spicy today.

3501
03:05:28,100 --> 03:05:30,100
I'm gonna get the Bunny Max.

3502
03:05:31,100 --> 03:05:33,100
Because I'm gonna...

3503
03:05:33,100 --> 03:05:34,100
Nevermind.

3504
03:05:36,100 --> 03:05:37,100
Can I have some too?

3505
03:05:37,100 --> 03:05:38,100
No!

3506
03:05:38,100 --> 03:05:39,100
You can't!

3507
03:05:40,100 --> 03:05:41,100
Go away!

3508
03:05:46,100 --> 03:05:48,100
Please, please bring me her.

3509
03:05:48,100 --> 03:05:49,100
Please.

3510
03:05:49,100 --> 03:05:51,100
Oh, thank God!

3511
03:05:51,100 --> 03:05:52,100
Finally!

3512
03:05:56,100 --> 03:06:00,100
I guess the point is to lift the fantasy of having your life ruined by hostess club addiction.

3513
03:06:01,100 --> 03:06:02,100
Alright.

3514
03:06:03,100 --> 03:06:04,100
One voice.

3515
03:06:05,100 --> 03:06:06,100
One voice.

3516
03:06:06,100 --> 03:06:08,100
One voice to you, governor.

3517
03:06:10,100 --> 03:06:12,100
Oh, I saw some applesauce left.

3518
03:06:12,100 --> 03:06:13,100
I didn't even notice.

3519
03:06:17,100 --> 03:06:18,100
Blue.

3520
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:20,100
Sporty tomboy.

3521
03:06:21,100 --> 03:06:22,100
Mommy vibe.

3522
03:06:22,100 --> 03:06:23,100
Smoker voice.

3523
03:06:23,100 --> 03:06:25,100
Sexiest possible voice.

3524
03:06:25,100 --> 03:06:26,100
She's very coup d'etre.

3525
03:06:26,100 --> 03:06:27,100
Really?

3526
03:06:28,100 --> 03:06:29,100
Nerdy voice.

3527
03:06:29,100 --> 03:06:30,100
Mommy.

3528
03:06:31,100 --> 03:06:32,100
Theater attitude is like first.

3529
03:06:32,100 --> 03:06:33,100
Okay.

3530
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:34,100
We'll chat a little bit.

3531
03:06:34,100 --> 03:06:35,100
I'm gonna give her a present.

3532
03:06:36,100 --> 03:06:37,100
Actually, no.

3533
03:06:37,100 --> 03:06:38,100
I'm not gonna give her a turn just yet.

3534
03:06:38,100 --> 03:06:39,100
I'll give her...

3535
03:06:39,100 --> 03:06:41,100
I might extend my time with her.

3536
03:06:42,100 --> 03:06:43,100
Because I've talked to them the most.

3537
03:06:43,100 --> 03:06:44,100
They're two girls.

3538
03:06:45,100 --> 03:06:46,100
Wanna get some food?

3539
03:06:47,100 --> 03:06:48,100
Um...

3540
03:06:50,100 --> 03:06:52,100
Let's get some whatever the fuck this is.

3541
03:06:55,100 --> 03:06:56,100
I love this.

3542
03:06:56,100 --> 03:06:57,100
This is really delicious.

3543
03:06:58,100 --> 03:07:00,100
I'm feeling all sorts of happiness.

3544
03:07:01,100 --> 03:07:02,100
Oh, hello.

3545
03:07:02,100 --> 03:07:03,100
Nice to meet you.

3546
03:07:04,100 --> 03:07:06,100
Would you like to introduce yourself?

3547
03:07:07,100 --> 03:07:08,100
Oh, yeah.

3548
03:07:08,100 --> 03:07:10,100
You may call me Hito Kanda.

3549
03:07:11,100 --> 03:07:12,100
Oh.

3550
03:07:13,100 --> 03:07:15,100
You don't have to be polite with me.

3551
03:07:17,100 --> 03:07:18,100
I see.

3552
03:07:18,100 --> 03:07:19,100
I mean, okay.

3553
03:07:19,100 --> 03:07:20,100
I'm Hito Kanda.

3554
03:07:20,100 --> 03:07:22,100
I help my friend for work.

3555
03:07:23,100 --> 03:07:24,100
I didn't ask that.

3556
03:07:25,100 --> 03:07:27,100
You help your friends?

3557
03:07:27,100 --> 03:07:28,100
Like...

3558
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:29,100
with a hand job?

3559
03:07:30,100 --> 03:07:31,100
Huh?

3560
03:07:31,100 --> 03:07:32,100
Yeah.

3561
03:07:33,100 --> 03:07:35,100
I was working at a company up until recently,

3562
03:07:35,100 --> 03:07:37,100
but I messed up.

3563
03:07:37,100 --> 03:07:38,100
It got fired.

3564
03:07:39,100 --> 03:07:40,100
Fired?

3565
03:07:41,100 --> 03:07:42,100
Right.

3566
03:07:43,100 --> 03:07:46,100
Are you bad at holding conversation?

3567
03:07:48,100 --> 03:07:50,100
Are you a person of a few words?

3568
03:07:51,100 --> 03:07:54,100
I guess I don't speak much.

3569
03:07:56,100 --> 03:07:57,100
Um...

3570
03:07:57,100 --> 03:07:58,100
Hito.

3571
03:07:59,100 --> 03:08:00,100
Why do you sound like a fucking robot?

3572
03:08:00,100 --> 03:08:01,100
Yeah?

3573
03:08:02,100 --> 03:08:03,100
I'm...

3574
03:08:03,100 --> 03:08:05,100
Oh, I just spilled apple sauce on my shirt.

3575
03:08:08,100 --> 03:08:09,100
Ah!

3576
03:08:09,100 --> 03:08:10,100
I was choked on it.

3577
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:12,100
Ow, I just hit my head on my mic.

3578
03:08:13,100 --> 03:08:14,100
I'm falling apart.

3579
03:08:16,100 --> 03:08:17,100
I'm sorry.

3580
03:08:19,100 --> 03:08:21,100
You're kind of a loser.

3581
03:08:27,100 --> 03:08:29,100
That guy is a charmer.

3582
03:08:34,100 --> 03:08:35,100
What does that mean?

3583
03:08:36,100 --> 03:08:38,100
I'm sorry I'm like this.

3584
03:08:38,100 --> 03:08:40,100
Maybe you won't be able to have a good time.

3585
03:08:41,100 --> 03:08:42,100
It's okay.

3586
03:08:42,100 --> 03:08:43,100
Who knows what will happen?

3587
03:08:44,100 --> 03:08:45,100
You can suck my dick.

3588
03:08:46,100 --> 03:08:48,100
I can suck your toes.

3589
03:08:49,100 --> 03:08:50,100
You can suck my dick.

3590
03:08:51,100 --> 03:08:52,100
Just met each other.

3591
03:08:53,100 --> 03:08:54,100
You can suck my dick.

3592
03:08:55,100 --> 03:08:57,100
I think it would be nice if you could suck my dick.

3593
03:08:57,100 --> 03:08:59,100
Just take things slow, you know?

3594
03:08:59,100 --> 03:09:00,100
First base.

3595
03:09:01,100 --> 03:09:02,100
Suck in my dick.

3596
03:09:03,100 --> 03:09:04,100
No rush.

3597
03:09:04,100 --> 03:09:06,100
You already started to get to know each other.

3598
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:10,100
Oh, thank you.

3599
03:09:11,100 --> 03:09:12,100
You're kind one, Haido.

3600
03:09:13,100 --> 03:09:15,100
Do you want some alcohol?

3601
03:09:16,100 --> 03:09:17,100
What should I do?

3602
03:09:17,100 --> 03:09:19,100
Is there anything I should prepare?

3603
03:09:20,100 --> 03:09:21,100
Yeah!

3604
03:09:22,100 --> 03:09:24,100
My efforts have been rewarded.

3605
03:09:25,100 --> 03:09:27,100
I want to drink something delicious.

3606
03:09:29,100 --> 03:09:30,100
What drink did you want?

3607
03:09:31,100 --> 03:09:33,100
I'm giving her like several different voices.

3608
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:34,100
I'm so sorry.

3609
03:09:34,100 --> 03:09:35,100
I'm buying you...

3610
03:09:36,100 --> 03:09:37,100
I don't have enough money.

3611
03:09:40,100 --> 03:09:41,100
Okay, what drink do I want?

3612
03:09:41,100 --> 03:09:42,100
So I will have...

3613
03:09:43,100 --> 03:09:44,100
I'll just have a beer.

3614
03:09:45,100 --> 03:09:46,100
Where's the beer?

3615
03:09:46,100 --> 03:09:47,100
Where the fuck is the beer?

3616
03:09:47,100 --> 03:09:48,100
I'll just have a beer.

3617
03:09:48,100 --> 03:09:50,100
I don't know why we have it in these glasses, but...

3618
03:09:52,100 --> 03:09:53,100
Can I have a drink with you?

3619
03:09:54,100 --> 03:09:57,100
Yes, my beautiful princess.

3620
03:09:57,100 --> 03:09:59,100
I'm going to get you a bunny punch.

3621
03:10:01,100 --> 03:10:03,100
Because I'm going to punch my dick into your womb

3622
03:10:03,100 --> 03:10:04,100
and fill you with children.

3623
03:10:06,100 --> 03:10:08,100
I like that.

3624
03:10:08,100 --> 03:10:09,100
All right.

3625
03:10:13,100 --> 03:10:14,100
What?

3626
03:10:14,100 --> 03:10:15,100
That's it?

3627
03:10:15,100 --> 03:10:16,100
I expected more.

3628
03:10:19,100 --> 03:10:20,100
The deep Riz.

3629
03:10:21,100 --> 03:10:22,100
S2 Riz.

3630
03:10:22,100 --> 03:10:23,100
Thank you.

3631
03:10:24,100 --> 03:10:25,100
Okay, I have a present for you.

3632
03:10:29,100 --> 03:10:32,100
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

3633
03:10:33,100 --> 03:10:34,100
I hope you like it.

3634
03:10:35,100 --> 03:10:36,100
It smells like my mom.

3635
03:10:39,100 --> 03:10:40,100
What?

3636
03:10:40,100 --> 03:10:41,100
Don't worry about it.

3637
03:10:44,100 --> 03:10:45,100
Okay, thanks.

3638
03:10:47,100 --> 03:10:48,100
We have to take care of it.

3639
03:10:49,100 --> 03:10:50,100
Take care of what?

3640
03:10:51,100 --> 03:10:52,100
Your dick.

3641
03:10:52,100 --> 03:10:53,100
Huh?

3642
03:10:54,100 --> 03:10:55,100
What?

3643
03:10:58,100 --> 03:11:00,100
I keep doing double takes to see if this is a title.

3644
03:11:00,100 --> 03:11:02,100
Like I can't get a title.

3645
03:11:02,100 --> 03:11:04,100
Like my role.

3646
03:11:05,100 --> 03:11:10,100
Why are they just staring at each other and quiet?

3647
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:12,100
Oh my God.

3648
03:11:14,100 --> 03:11:16,100
Wait, wait, you buy a drink for the bartenders?

3649
03:11:16,100 --> 03:11:18,100
Yes, yes, you do.

3650
03:11:20,100 --> 03:11:23,100
This is going to stream today.

3651
03:11:25,100 --> 03:11:27,100
Is there anything you want to talk about?

3652
03:11:28,100 --> 03:11:33,100
Yeah, you think tomorrow will be sunny or whatever?

3653
03:11:36,100 --> 03:11:38,100
There's a monsoon raging outside.

3654
03:11:41,100 --> 03:11:42,100
I have no idea.

3655
03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:44,100
I have no idea.

3656
03:11:45,100 --> 03:11:46,100
I have no idea.

3657
03:11:47,100 --> 03:11:48,100
I have no idea.

3658
03:11:49,100 --> 03:11:50,100
Sorry.

3659
03:11:53,100 --> 03:11:56,100
Buy a drink for the bartender to take a small sip and throw it into the plants.

3660
03:11:56,100 --> 03:11:57,100
Hell yeah.

3661
03:11:57,100 --> 03:11:59,100
But like how do they pace themselves?

3662
03:11:59,100 --> 03:12:03,100
You have to have like quite, like you have to be able to handle your liquor if you're

3663
03:12:03,100 --> 03:12:09,100
serving patrons for, let's say like, let's say your shift is like five hours and

3664
03:12:09,100 --> 03:12:11,100
maybe you hang out with a guy for each hour.

3665
03:12:11,100 --> 03:12:13,100
Like how many of you buying you more drinks?

3666
03:12:13,100 --> 03:12:14,100
Is this happening?

3667
03:12:14,100 --> 03:12:16,100
Like I need to know the schematics.

3668
03:12:21,100 --> 03:12:23,100
Do they really only take one sip?

3669
03:12:25,100 --> 03:12:26,100
I don't know.

3670
03:12:26,100 --> 03:12:29,100
No, like legit, like tell me the tea.

3671
03:12:30,100 --> 03:12:31,100
Is the tea piping hot?

3672
03:12:31,100 --> 03:12:32,100
Cause spill it.

3673
03:12:34,100 --> 03:12:35,100
You don't drink with every patron?

3674
03:12:35,100 --> 03:12:36,100
Okay.

3675
03:12:36,100 --> 03:12:37,100
Do they actually puke constantly?

3676
03:12:38,100 --> 03:12:40,100
This is the equivalent of the ghost anime top.

3677
03:12:41,100 --> 03:12:42,100
That fucking dump is hilarious.

3678
03:12:44,100 --> 03:12:45,100
It's basically their tipping.

3679
03:12:45,100 --> 03:12:46,100
They mix it for themselves.

3680
03:12:46,100 --> 03:12:47,100
They probably don't mix.

3681
03:12:47,100 --> 03:12:49,100
Oh, that's true.

3682
03:12:49,100 --> 03:12:50,100
Cause I had a friend.

3683
03:12:50,100 --> 03:12:52,100
Actually, I don't have a friend.

3684
03:12:52,100 --> 03:12:53,100
She does this currently.

3685
03:12:53,100 --> 03:12:54,100
Olive.

3686
03:12:54,100 --> 03:12:58,100
She bartends and she tells me sometimes customers try to buy her a drink and she just literally

3687
03:12:58,100 --> 03:13:02,100
gives herself like a sprite and says it's a gin and tonic.

3688
03:13:04,100 --> 03:13:05,100
Yeah, or they mix the drink of water.

3689
03:13:06,100 --> 03:13:08,100
Excuse me, hostess.

3690
03:13:08,100 --> 03:13:09,100
Will you bear my children?

3691
03:13:11,100 --> 03:13:14,100
Like there is a job somewhere in the world that you just get paid to drink.

3692
03:13:14,100 --> 03:13:15,100
That's basis.

3693
03:13:15,100 --> 03:13:16,100
That's kind of cool.

3694
03:13:16,100 --> 03:13:17,100
I'm like hostess job.

3695
03:13:17,100 --> 03:13:18,100
That's not bad.

3696
03:13:19,100 --> 03:13:20,100
Like does it pay well?

3697
03:13:21,100 --> 03:13:26,100
You know, shall we look up the weather forecast cause we're fucking nerds?

3698
03:13:27,100 --> 03:13:29,100
Are you always curious about the weather?

3699
03:13:31,100 --> 03:13:35,100
I just want to know how wet you're going to be tomorrow.

3700
03:13:35,100 --> 03:13:36,100
No, not really.

3701
03:13:36,100 --> 03:13:37,100
I'm just making small talk.

3702
03:13:40,100 --> 03:13:41,100
Oh, sorry.

3703
03:13:41,100 --> 03:13:43,100
I didn't mean anything by that.

3704
03:13:44,100 --> 03:13:46,100
This is who I am all the time.

3705
03:13:47,100 --> 03:13:48,100
Is that okay with you?

3706
03:13:49,100 --> 03:13:51,100
Can you please marry me?

3707
03:13:52,100 --> 03:13:53,100
It's all right with me.

3708
03:13:53,100 --> 03:13:54,100
So please marry me.

3709
03:13:54,100 --> 03:13:55,100
I'm on my knees.

3710
03:13:55,100 --> 03:13:56,100
Please.

3711
03:13:56,100 --> 03:13:57,100
I'm begging.

3712
03:13:57,100 --> 03:14:00,100
We're just starting to get into each other, but you're the one in my life.

3713
03:14:01,100 --> 03:14:03,100
You're a peculiar one.

3714
03:14:03,100 --> 03:14:04,100
Please.

3715
03:14:05,100 --> 03:14:06,100
You laughed just now, didn't you?

3716
03:14:06,100 --> 03:14:07,100
That means you should marry me.

3717
03:14:08,100 --> 03:14:09,100
I also know where you live.

3718
03:14:09,100 --> 03:14:10,100
I know where all the girls here live.

3719
03:14:12,100 --> 03:14:13,100
Okay.

3720
03:14:13,100 --> 03:14:16,100
You have a cute smile, especially when you're sleeping.

3721
03:14:17,100 --> 03:14:18,100
What?

3722
03:14:18,100 --> 03:14:19,100
Anyways.

3723
03:14:20,100 --> 03:14:22,100
Oh, uh, thanks.

3724
03:14:23,100 --> 03:14:24,100
What will you do?

3725
03:14:24,100 --> 03:14:25,100
Are you still going to drink?

3726
03:14:26,100 --> 03:14:27,100
Should I prepare some more alcohol?

3727
03:14:28,100 --> 03:14:29,100
Yeah.

3728
03:14:30,100 --> 03:14:31,100
Thank you.

3729
03:14:31,100 --> 03:14:32,100
It means you'll still be with me.

3730
03:14:33,100 --> 03:14:34,100
What drink did you want?

3731
03:14:35,100 --> 03:14:37,100
Uh, can I get like absolutely black?

3732
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:38,100
Oh, I can only have three drinks.

3733
03:14:38,100 --> 03:14:39,100
Okay.

3734
03:14:40,100 --> 03:14:44,100
Um, I'll have some wine for Chip.

3735
03:14:45,100 --> 03:14:46,100
We're hanging out.

3736
03:14:49,100 --> 03:14:51,100
Beer before liquor, never been sicker.

3737
03:14:51,100 --> 03:14:52,100
Liquor before beer.

3738
03:14:52,100 --> 03:14:53,100
You're in the clear.

3739
03:14:55,100 --> 03:14:56,100
Can I have a drink with you?

3740
03:14:56,100 --> 03:14:57,100
Of course you can.

3741
03:14:57,100 --> 03:14:58,100
Girlie pop.

3742
03:14:59,100 --> 03:15:01,100
Only the best for my queen.

3743
03:15:01,100 --> 03:15:03,100
Only the best for my queen.

3744
03:15:05,100 --> 03:15:06,100
I'm so happy.

3745
03:15:06,100 --> 03:15:07,100
I'll get the bottle.

3746
03:15:14,100 --> 03:15:16,100
Oh, I got enough cash.

3747
03:15:16,100 --> 03:15:17,100
Yeah, I got fucking enough cash.

3748
03:15:21,100 --> 03:15:23,100
You can buy the 50K you had bought all about ending.

3749
03:15:24,100 --> 03:15:25,100
Let's chat.

3750
03:15:28,100 --> 03:15:29,100
Are you having fun?

3751
03:15:30,100 --> 03:15:32,100
She looks so fucking pissed off right now.

3752
03:15:33,100 --> 03:15:34,100
Yeah.

3753
03:15:34,100 --> 03:15:35,100
Why are you looking at me like that?

3754
03:15:35,100 --> 03:15:37,100
No, I think I'm enjoying myself.

3755
03:15:37,100 --> 03:15:38,100
Please stop looking at me like that.

3756
03:15:39,100 --> 03:15:40,100
Good.

3757
03:15:40,100 --> 03:15:41,100
Well, that's nice.

3758
03:15:42,100 --> 03:15:45,100
Miuka Chen, are you enjoying yourself?

3759
03:15:46,100 --> 03:15:47,100
Still undecided.

3760
03:15:48,100 --> 03:15:49,100
You kind of smell bad.

3761
03:15:50,100 --> 03:15:52,100
I would rather be hanging out with the people over there.

3762
03:15:53,100 --> 03:15:57,100
They actually buy me the 50KN bottle.

3763
03:15:58,100 --> 03:15:59,100
But it's whatever.

3764
03:16:01,100 --> 03:16:03,100
I don't exactly hate it.

3765
03:16:08,100 --> 03:16:09,100
Why don't you hate it?

3766
03:16:12,100 --> 03:16:13,100
Is that it?

3767
03:16:13,100 --> 03:16:14,100
I don't even know why I asked that.

3768
03:16:15,100 --> 03:16:17,100
She's looking at us like we're garbage.

3769
03:16:17,100 --> 03:16:20,100
You kind of gross me out and you kind of disgust me.

3770
03:16:22,100 --> 03:16:24,100
I would rather not hang out with trash like you,

3771
03:16:25,100 --> 03:16:27,100
but I need to pay the bills.

3772
03:16:28,100 --> 03:16:29,100
So here I am.

3773
03:16:32,100 --> 03:16:33,100
I don't know.

3774
03:16:33,100 --> 03:16:34,100
I wonder why.

3775
03:16:35,100 --> 03:16:37,100
Um, huh?

3776
03:16:38,100 --> 03:16:39,100
I don't believe you.

3777
03:16:40,100 --> 03:16:41,100
I know.

3778
03:16:41,100 --> 03:16:42,100
Are you really enjoying it?

3779
03:16:42,100 --> 03:16:44,100
Why are these girls gaslighting me?

3780
03:16:45,100 --> 03:16:48,100
They literally like, I'm fine and they're like, you're not okay.

3781
03:16:49,100 --> 03:16:50,100
Tell me what's wrong.

3782
03:16:51,100 --> 03:16:52,100
Give me your money.

3783
03:16:53,100 --> 03:16:54,100
And buy me a drink.

3784
03:16:55,100 --> 03:16:56,100
And I'll pretend to cheer you up.

3785
03:16:56,100 --> 03:17:02,100
So when you come here, you think you're getting serotonin and dopamine from only me.

3786
03:17:02,100 --> 03:17:06,100
So then you have to come and you have to spend more money to feel like you're okay.

3787
03:17:06,100 --> 03:17:09,100
Because you need me to tell you when you're okay or not.

3788
03:17:09,100 --> 03:17:10,100
This is toxic as hell.

3789
03:17:15,100 --> 03:17:18,100
This is a scyop.

3790
03:17:19,100 --> 03:17:20,100
This is a fucking scyop.

3791
03:17:23,100 --> 03:17:25,100
Just, I don't know how, but it is.

3792
03:17:30,100 --> 03:17:31,100
It's okay.

3793
03:17:32,100 --> 03:17:33,100
You don't have to worry about me.

3794
03:17:35,100 --> 03:17:36,100
I worry though.

3795
03:17:36,100 --> 03:17:37,100
You're my customer.

3796
03:17:38,100 --> 03:17:39,100
You must have a good time.

3797
03:17:40,100 --> 03:17:42,100
You must have a good time.

3798
03:17:43,100 --> 03:17:44,100
Okay.

3799
03:17:44,100 --> 03:17:45,100
Is she an android?

3800
03:17:47,100 --> 03:17:48,100
I don't know, man.

3801
03:17:48,100 --> 03:17:49,100
Okay.

3802
03:17:50,100 --> 03:17:53,100
Well, everyone enjoys themselves in their own way.

3803
03:17:55,100 --> 03:17:57,100
I'm not enjoying this.

3804
03:17:57,100 --> 03:17:59,100
I wish I was doing something else.

3805
03:17:59,100 --> 03:18:01,100
You're so odd.

3806
03:18:01,100 --> 03:18:02,100
Did you know that?

3807
03:18:04,100 --> 03:18:05,100
Yeah, I know.

3808
03:18:07,100 --> 03:18:08,100
It's whatever.

3809
03:18:09,100 --> 03:18:11,100
I don't exactly hate it.

3810
03:18:11,100 --> 03:18:12,100
I hate you.

3811
03:18:13,100 --> 03:18:15,100
You're not worth my time.

3812
03:18:17,100 --> 03:18:18,100
Oh, it's getting late.

3813
03:18:18,100 --> 03:18:19,100
I should go home soon.

3814
03:18:20,100 --> 03:18:21,100
Yeah, you should.

3815
03:18:23,100 --> 03:18:24,100
Shit, that's a lot of money.

3816
03:18:26,100 --> 03:18:27,100
See you.

3817
03:18:27,100 --> 03:18:28,100
I'll be waiting.

3818
03:18:29,100 --> 03:18:30,100
I just wanted to step on me.

3819
03:18:31,100 --> 03:18:32,100
Yeah, thanks for everything.

3820
03:18:32,100 --> 03:18:33,100
See you soon.

3821
03:18:37,100 --> 03:18:38,100
Statement.

3822
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:39,100
It did good times.

3823
03:18:40,100 --> 03:18:42,100
We had a good conversation.

3824
03:18:42,100 --> 03:18:44,100
I'm looking forward to going to work now.

3825
03:18:46,100 --> 03:18:48,100
I don't want to go back there again.

3826
03:18:49,100 --> 03:18:51,100
Where's your money gone?

3827
03:18:52,100 --> 03:18:53,100
All right.

3828
03:18:53,100 --> 03:18:54,100
Pay me.

3829
03:18:55,100 --> 03:18:56,100
Fuck you.

3830
03:18:56,100 --> 03:18:57,100
Pay me.

3831
03:18:57,100 --> 03:18:58,100
What?

3832
03:18:58,100 --> 03:18:59,100
I thought I was going to get more money.

3833
03:18:59,100 --> 03:19:00,100
Okay.

3834
03:19:00,100 --> 03:19:01,100
Gamble time.

3835
03:19:04,100 --> 03:19:08,100
Actually, I should have bought more gifts

3836
03:19:08,100 --> 03:19:09,100
before I did this.

3837
03:19:15,100 --> 03:19:16,100
Fuck it.

3838
03:19:19,100 --> 03:19:20,100
We're going to win big.

3839
03:19:21,100 --> 03:19:22,100
We're going to win big.

3840
03:19:29,100 --> 03:19:30,100
We're going again.

3841
03:19:30,100 --> 03:19:31,100
We're making our money back.

3842
03:19:33,100 --> 03:19:37,100
Work, drink, fuck bitches, get money,

3843
03:19:37,100 --> 03:19:38,100
gamble.

3844
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:40,100
We're hitting the lottery today.

3845
03:19:43,100 --> 03:19:45,100
Let's fucking go again.

3846
03:19:45,100 --> 03:19:46,100
Again.

3847
03:19:46,100 --> 03:19:48,100
Make it fucking happen.

3848
03:19:49,100 --> 03:19:51,100
We're making it fucking happen.

3849
03:19:55,100 --> 03:19:57,100
Is this what trainwrecks feels like?

3850
03:19:57,100 --> 03:19:58,100
Oh fuck.

3851
03:19:58,100 --> 03:19:59,100
When he wins.

3852
03:20:02,100 --> 03:20:03,100
Another one.

3853
03:20:04,100 --> 03:20:06,100
That was a small fish.

3854
03:20:06,100 --> 03:20:07,100
Small fish gamble.

3855
03:20:07,100 --> 03:20:09,100
We're going to win big.

3856
03:20:11,100 --> 03:20:13,100
Nah, we didn't win that much.

3857
03:20:18,100 --> 03:20:19,100
Hello, hello.

3858
03:20:19,100 --> 03:20:20,100
Welcome back.

3859
03:20:25,100 --> 03:20:27,100
Fuck your mother one more time.

3860
03:20:27,100 --> 03:20:28,100
Just kidding.

3861
03:20:28,100 --> 03:20:29,100
Not one more time.

3862
03:20:29,100 --> 03:20:30,100
We're just going to gamble the max amount of times

3863
03:20:30,100 --> 03:20:31,100
you can gamble.

3864
03:20:32,100 --> 03:20:33,100
Please.

3865
03:20:37,100 --> 03:20:38,100
All right.

3866
03:20:38,100 --> 03:20:39,100
All right.

3867
03:20:39,100 --> 03:20:40,100
All right.

3868
03:20:40,100 --> 03:20:41,100
All right.

3869
03:20:41,100 --> 03:20:42,100
All right.

3870
03:20:42,100 --> 03:20:43,100
Keep going.

3871
03:20:43,100 --> 03:20:44,100
Keep going.

3872
03:20:44,100 --> 03:20:45,100
We can gamble 10 times a day.

3873
03:20:45,100 --> 03:20:46,100
We're doing it.

3874
03:20:46,100 --> 03:20:47,100
We're doing it.

3875
03:20:49,100 --> 03:20:51,100
It feels like playing gotcha indeed.

3876
03:20:52,100 --> 03:20:54,100
You hit that one character.

3877
03:20:55,100 --> 03:20:56,100
Fuck yeah.

3878
03:20:56,100 --> 03:20:58,100
We're kind of back where we started one more time.

3879
03:21:02,100 --> 03:21:03,100
Let's get it.

3880
03:21:03,100 --> 03:21:04,100
Let's get it.

3881
03:21:04,100 --> 03:21:05,100
Let's get it.

3882
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:06,100
Let's get it.

3883
03:21:06,100 --> 03:21:07,100
We're good.

3884
03:21:07,100 --> 03:21:08,100
We're good.

3885
03:21:08,100 --> 03:21:09,100
We're hitting it.

3886
03:21:09,100 --> 03:21:10,100
We're hitting it.

3887
03:21:10,100 --> 03:21:11,100
We're hitting it.

3888
03:21:11,100 --> 03:21:12,100
Okay.

3889
03:21:12,100 --> 03:21:13,100
We're...

3890
03:21:13,100 --> 03:21:14,100
It's fine.

3891
03:21:14,100 --> 03:21:15,100
Don't worry about it.

3892
03:21:15,100 --> 03:21:16,100
Don't worry about it.

3893
03:21:16,100 --> 03:21:17,100
We're going.

3894
03:21:17,100 --> 03:21:18,100
We're back.

3895
03:21:18,100 --> 03:21:19,100
We're going to be back.

3896
03:21:19,100 --> 03:21:20,100
Watch.

3897
03:21:20,100 --> 03:21:21,100
We're back.

3898
03:21:21,100 --> 03:21:22,100
We're back.

3899
03:21:25,100 --> 03:21:27,100
I can't gamble anymore.

3900
03:21:32,100 --> 03:21:33,100
We're back.

3901
03:21:33,100 --> 03:21:34,100
We're back.

3902
03:21:34,100 --> 03:21:35,100
Oh, fuck.

3903
03:21:36,100 --> 03:21:37,100
We're back.

3904
03:21:38,100 --> 03:21:39,100
We're so back.

3905
03:21:40,100 --> 03:21:41,100
Don't worry about it.

3906
03:21:41,100 --> 03:21:44,100
Fuck the negative 20K yen.

3907
03:21:44,100 --> 03:21:45,100
We didn't need that.

3908
03:21:45,100 --> 03:21:46,100
We're getting big.

3909
03:21:46,100 --> 03:21:47,100
We're hitting it big.

3910
03:21:53,100 --> 03:21:54,100
We're hitting it big.

3911
03:21:56,100 --> 03:21:57,100
It doesn't matter.

3912
03:21:57,100 --> 03:21:58,100
It doesn't matter.

3913
03:21:59,100 --> 03:22:00,100
The next one.

3914
03:22:01,100 --> 03:22:02,100
The next one.

3915
03:22:08,100 --> 03:22:09,100
The next one.

3916
03:22:09,100 --> 03:22:10,100
The next one.

3917
03:22:14,100 --> 03:22:15,100
I don't have a problem.

3918
03:22:15,100 --> 03:22:16,100
I don't have a problem.

3919
03:22:18,100 --> 03:22:19,100
I don't have a problem.

3920
03:22:20,100 --> 03:22:21,100
Fuck you.

3921
03:22:23,100 --> 03:22:25,100
I want to be back at 70K.

3922
03:22:26,100 --> 03:22:27,100
I'm not going to go bankrupt.

3923
03:22:27,100 --> 03:22:28,100
Don't worry about it.

3924
03:22:28,100 --> 03:22:29,100
Don't worry about it.

3925
03:22:29,100 --> 03:22:30,100
We're fine.

3926
03:22:31,100 --> 03:22:32,100
We're fine.

3927
03:22:38,100 --> 03:22:39,100
We're fine.

3928
03:22:48,100 --> 03:22:49,100
The girls are worried.

3929
03:22:49,100 --> 03:22:50,100
Don't worry about it.

3930
03:22:50,100 --> 03:22:51,100
They're not worried.

3931
03:22:51,100 --> 03:22:52,100
They're cheering me on.

3932
03:22:52,100 --> 03:22:53,100
See?

3933
03:22:53,100 --> 03:22:54,100
Boom.

3934
03:22:54,100 --> 03:22:55,100
Boom.

3935
03:22:57,100 --> 03:22:59,100
I don't need to spend time

3936
03:23:00,100 --> 03:23:02,100
with those bitches at Barney Garden.

3937
03:23:03,100 --> 03:23:05,100
I'm a hustler, baby.

3938
03:23:05,100 --> 03:23:06,100
All right?

3939
03:23:07,100 --> 03:23:09,100
I'm a hustler, baby.

3940
03:23:10,100 --> 03:23:12,100
Aggressive T key.

3941
03:23:13,100 --> 03:23:14,100
The key.

3942
03:23:14,100 --> 03:23:15,100
I can't fucking say anything.

3943
03:23:15,100 --> 03:23:16,100
Key.

3944
03:23:18,100 --> 03:23:19,100
Touched.

3945
03:23:19,100 --> 03:23:20,100
Key type.

3946
03:23:25,100 --> 03:23:26,100
We might be back.

3947
03:23:26,100 --> 03:23:27,100
We're not quite.

3948
03:23:27,100 --> 03:23:28,100
We're getting there.

3949
03:23:30,100 --> 03:23:31,100
She be mistress.

3950
03:23:31,100 --> 03:23:32,100
Lovely.

3951
03:23:32,100 --> 03:23:33,100
I'm begging you.

3952
03:23:33,100 --> 03:23:34,100
Don't lose the house.

3953
03:23:35,100 --> 03:23:36,100
Don't worry.

3954
03:23:36,100 --> 03:23:38,100
The house where the house is still okay.

3955
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:42,100
We had to sell one of our children,

3956
03:23:42,100 --> 03:23:43,100
but it's fine.

3957
03:23:45,100 --> 03:23:47,100
Very some sweet nice people

3958
03:23:47,100 --> 03:23:49,100
are taking care of her now.

3959
03:23:53,100 --> 03:23:54,100
All right, we lost the house.

3960
03:23:58,100 --> 03:23:59,100
You know what that means.

3961
03:23:59,100 --> 03:24:00,100
We got it.

3962
03:24:00,100 --> 03:24:01,100
We got it.

3963
03:24:02,100 --> 03:24:03,100
We got it, you know.

3964
03:24:07,100 --> 03:24:08,100
It's not over.

3965
03:24:08,100 --> 03:24:10,100
It's not over till I say it's over.

3966
03:24:10,100 --> 03:24:11,100
All right.

3967
03:24:11,100 --> 03:24:12,100
All right.

3968
03:24:14,100 --> 03:24:16,100
It's not over till I say it's over.

3969
03:24:24,100 --> 03:24:25,100
I didn't perform that well

3970
03:24:25,100 --> 03:24:27,100
because I just was gambling my money away.

3971
03:24:27,100 --> 03:24:28,100
All right.

3972
03:24:28,100 --> 03:24:29,100
Let's go see the bitches.

3973
03:24:33,100 --> 03:24:35,100
I sold Ernesto the fuck.

3974
03:24:38,100 --> 03:24:39,100
Only lose when you stop.

3975
03:24:39,100 --> 03:24:40,100
Exactly.

3976
03:24:40,100 --> 03:24:41,100
Hello, hello.

3977
03:24:41,100 --> 03:24:42,100
Welcome in.

3978
03:24:44,100 --> 03:24:46,100
When you start selling up parent members.

3979
03:24:48,100 --> 03:24:50,100
That was the first things I sold.

3980
03:24:50,100 --> 03:24:51,100
Sorry guys.

3981
03:24:51,100 --> 03:24:52,100
Sorry.

3982
03:24:55,100 --> 03:24:57,100
Your hair is clipping through your hair.

3983
03:24:57,100 --> 03:24:58,100
What is that?

3984
03:24:58,100 --> 03:24:59,100
Whoa.

3985
03:24:59,100 --> 03:25:00,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3986
03:25:00,100 --> 03:25:01,100
Whoa.

3987
03:25:02,100 --> 03:25:03,100
Sorry, I was looking.

3988
03:25:03,100 --> 03:25:04,100
I had a that's a raven moment.

3989
03:25:04,100 --> 03:25:06,100
I was looking into the future at her dialogue

3990
03:25:06,100 --> 03:25:07,100
and into the past.

3991
03:25:07,100 --> 03:25:08,100
You mean a memory?

3992
03:25:08,100 --> 03:25:09,100
Don't worry about it.

3993
03:25:10,100 --> 03:25:12,100
Oh, you came on my tits again.

3994
03:25:12,100 --> 03:25:14,100
I tell you not to just walk in

3995
03:25:14,100 --> 03:25:15,100
and you just shoot on me.

3996
03:25:15,100 --> 03:25:16,100
I don't.

3997
03:25:16,100 --> 03:25:17,100
What drink did you want?

3998
03:25:19,100 --> 03:25:22,100
Oh, you know what?

3999
03:25:26,100 --> 03:25:30,100
Can I have some too?

4000
03:25:30,100 --> 03:25:31,100
No.

4001
03:25:31,100 --> 03:25:32,100
You can't.

4002
03:25:33,100 --> 03:25:34,100
You can't.

4003
03:25:34,100 --> 03:25:35,100
No.

4004
03:25:35,100 --> 03:25:36,100
Get away from me.

4005
03:25:38,100 --> 03:25:39,100
A customer called me.

4006
03:25:39,100 --> 03:25:40,100
Yeah.

4007
03:25:40,100 --> 03:25:41,100
Yeah.

4008
03:25:41,100 --> 03:25:42,100
Yeah.

4009
03:25:42,100 --> 03:25:43,100
Give me the blue girl.

4010
03:25:44,100 --> 03:25:45,100
Give me the blue girl.

4011
03:25:45,100 --> 03:25:46,100
Fuck whatever.

4012
03:25:46,100 --> 03:25:47,100
You're good enough.

4013
03:25:48,100 --> 03:25:49,100
How's it going?

4014
03:25:51,100 --> 03:25:53,100
What do you do on your days off?

4015
03:25:53,100 --> 03:25:54,100
Hi, Chan.

4016
03:25:54,100 --> 03:25:57,100
Oh, are you asking me on a T?

4017
03:25:57,100 --> 03:25:59,100
You're pretty aggressive, huh?

4018
03:25:59,100 --> 03:26:00,100
Hi, Chan.

4019
03:26:00,100 --> 03:26:02,100
Even though you turned down my threesome.

4020
03:26:02,100 --> 03:26:03,100
What?

4021
03:26:03,100 --> 03:26:05,100
I thought you were past this.

4022
03:26:06,100 --> 03:26:08,100
I broke time to get the cardboard box.

4023
03:26:08,100 --> 03:26:09,100
It happened to me deficit and funny.

4024
03:26:09,100 --> 03:26:11,100
I feel like the game just ends.

4025
03:26:12,100 --> 03:26:13,100
That's not what I meant.

4026
03:26:13,100 --> 03:26:15,100
I really am interested.

4027
03:26:15,100 --> 03:26:16,100
Oh, really?

4028
03:26:16,100 --> 03:26:18,100
That's no fun.

4029
03:26:18,100 --> 03:26:19,100
Don't you think I'm charming?

4030
03:26:19,100 --> 03:26:20,100
No.

4031
03:26:20,100 --> 03:26:22,100
I mean, of course I do.

4032
03:26:22,100 --> 03:26:31,100
I wouldn't come and come and come and come and get really nice online pictures.

4033
03:26:32,100 --> 03:26:34,100
I really like your Facebook page.

4034
03:26:35,100 --> 03:26:37,100
I wouldn't come and see you if I didn't.

4035
03:26:38,100 --> 03:26:40,100
It's funny that you think that.

4036
03:26:41,100 --> 03:26:43,100
It doesn't even hurt my pictures.

4037
03:26:43,100 --> 03:26:47,100
It's so funny that it's actually a little embarrassing.

4038
03:26:48,100 --> 03:26:50,100
Thanks.

4039
03:26:50,100 --> 03:26:51,100
Thanks, though.

4040
03:26:51,100 --> 03:26:53,100
Those pictures are so embarrassing.

4041
03:26:53,100 --> 03:26:59,100
Sometimes what freaks me out is the dialogue that I'm dubbing and making up makes sense for their responses.

4042
03:26:59,100 --> 03:27:01,100
She's like, it's so embarrassing.

4043
03:27:01,100 --> 03:27:07,100
Like, as if she was an actual fucking line.

4044
03:27:09,100 --> 03:27:11,100
It's so funny.

4045
03:27:12,100 --> 03:27:16,100
Thanks, though.

4046
03:27:16,100 --> 03:27:19,100
Did you like the bikini ones?

4047
03:27:19,100 --> 03:27:22,100
I mean, anyway, you want us to know about my days off?

4048
03:27:22,100 --> 03:27:23,100
Let's spin this around.

4049
03:27:23,100 --> 03:27:25,100
What do you think I do?

4050
03:27:26,100 --> 03:27:28,100
I feel like you go out shopping.

4051
03:27:28,100 --> 03:27:30,100
Go out shopping for clothes.

4052
03:27:30,100 --> 03:27:31,100
Sorry.

4053
03:27:31,100 --> 03:27:33,100
Go out shopping for clothes and stuff.

4054
03:27:33,100 --> 03:27:34,100
Too bad.

4055
03:27:34,100 --> 03:27:36,100
I'd like to shop, but I have no money.

4056
03:27:37,100 --> 03:27:38,100
Wow.

4057
03:27:38,100 --> 03:27:40,100
She's me for real for real.

4058
03:27:40,100 --> 03:27:43,100
So that's why I whore myself out in this bunny garden.

4059
03:27:43,100 --> 03:27:47,100
Please, can you please take the offer for the threesome?

4060
03:27:47,100 --> 03:27:49,100
I'm giving you a discount.

4061
03:27:49,100 --> 03:27:52,100
It's only $150.

4062
03:27:53,100 --> 03:27:55,100
Most of the time, it's $300.

4063
03:27:55,100 --> 03:27:57,100
You get two for the price of one.

4064
03:27:57,100 --> 03:27:58,100
Okay?

4065
03:27:58,100 --> 03:28:00,100
I'm not interested.

4066
03:28:00,100 --> 03:28:02,100
Whatever.

4067
03:28:02,100 --> 03:28:03,100
I went to a shop.

4068
03:28:03,100 --> 03:28:06,100
I wait until I find something I really want.

4069
03:28:06,100 --> 03:28:08,100
Then I buy it.

4070
03:28:08,100 --> 03:28:10,100
Buy home money.

4071
03:28:13,100 --> 03:28:15,100
She's planning something.

4072
03:28:15,100 --> 03:28:18,100
I went to karaoke in front of the station by myself last weekend.

4073
03:28:18,100 --> 03:28:21,100
I sang nothing but the songs I wanted to sing myself.

4074
03:28:21,100 --> 03:28:23,100
Doesn't everybody fucking do that?

4075
03:28:25,100 --> 03:28:29,100
I guess you try to pick songs that everyone knows when you go with friends.

4076
03:28:32,100 --> 03:28:34,100
Oh, that Tito's came back up.

4077
03:28:34,100 --> 03:28:35,100
Oh.

4078
03:28:35,100 --> 03:28:38,100
Then I mention it as a reflux when I have vodka.

4079
03:28:40,100 --> 03:28:41,100
Yeah.

4080
03:28:41,100 --> 03:28:42,100
I like hearing people sing.

4081
03:28:42,100 --> 03:28:44,100
So going with friends is fun too.

4082
03:28:44,100 --> 03:28:46,100
Mostly I just go by myself.

4083
03:28:46,100 --> 03:28:48,100
Because my friends are in my head.

4084
03:28:48,100 --> 03:28:50,100
They're talpas.

4085
03:28:51,100 --> 03:28:53,100
Shut up, Jeff.

4086
03:28:53,100 --> 03:28:56,100
Last weekend, I wanted to sing a blow-off scene.

4087
03:28:57,100 --> 03:28:59,100
What did you do last weekend, Hai Chen?

4088
03:28:59,100 --> 03:29:01,100
Or are you making out with girls maybe?

4089
03:29:01,100 --> 03:29:02,100
Whoa!

4090
03:29:02,100 --> 03:29:05,100
Slow your fucking roll, medium but premium.

4091
03:29:05,100 --> 03:29:06,100
Okay?

4092
03:29:06,100 --> 03:29:08,100
I was gambling.

4093
03:29:08,100 --> 03:29:10,100
Daddy gotta make that money.

4094
03:29:11,100 --> 03:29:12,100
Obviously not.

4095
03:29:12,100 --> 03:29:15,100
I don't even know anyone who'd want to.

4096
03:29:15,100 --> 03:29:17,100
I'm a fucking loser.

4097
03:29:18,100 --> 03:29:19,100
Oh yeah.

4098
03:29:19,100 --> 03:29:21,100
I guess you need two willing participants for that.

4099
03:29:21,100 --> 03:29:23,100
Like me and one of the other girls.

4100
03:29:23,100 --> 03:29:25,100
Four or three some.

4101
03:29:25,100 --> 03:29:28,100
All you have to do is pay me $150.

4102
03:29:29,100 --> 03:29:31,100
Well then, why don't I act as your partner?

4103
03:29:31,100 --> 03:29:33,100
Are you gonna make out with me?

4104
03:29:34,100 --> 03:29:35,100
What?

4105
03:29:35,100 --> 03:29:36,100
Here.

4106
03:29:36,100 --> 03:29:37,100
I'll blow you a kiss.

4107
03:29:41,100 --> 03:29:43,100
That's all for now.

4108
03:29:43,100 --> 03:29:45,100
So hang in there, okay?

4109
03:29:46,100 --> 03:29:47,100
Wait, wait, wait.

4110
03:29:47,100 --> 03:29:48,100
She's zipper.

4111
03:29:51,100 --> 03:29:53,100
Hey, Chloe, can you get a rag?

4112
03:29:53,100 --> 03:29:55,100
Yeah, this one just popped.

4113
03:29:55,100 --> 03:29:56,100
Yeah, thank you.

4114
03:29:56,100 --> 03:29:57,100
Thank you.

4115
03:29:58,100 --> 03:29:59,100
Hai Chen, how about drinks?

4116
03:29:59,100 --> 03:30:00,100
Do you want a bit more?

4117
03:30:00,100 --> 03:30:02,100
Should I get you something?

4118
03:30:05,100 --> 03:30:07,100
No, I don't have any money.

4119
03:30:10,100 --> 03:30:11,100
Cheers to my pants.

4120
03:30:11,100 --> 03:30:13,100
Cheers in my pants.

4121
03:30:13,100 --> 03:30:15,100
I don't relax.

4122
03:30:17,100 --> 03:30:19,100
I'm sitting at the checkout line.

4123
03:30:24,100 --> 03:30:26,100
Wow, is it already this late?

4124
03:30:26,100 --> 03:30:28,100
I'll head back home.

4125
03:30:31,100 --> 03:30:33,100
Please come again.

4126
03:30:33,100 --> 03:30:34,100
I'll be waiting.

4127
03:30:34,100 --> 03:30:36,100
Yeah, thank you for today.

4128
03:30:41,100 --> 03:30:43,100
I'm gonna gamble.

4129
03:30:46,100 --> 03:30:48,100
I should have saved.

4130
03:30:56,100 --> 03:30:58,100
Yeah.

4131
03:30:58,100 --> 03:31:01,100
Okay, I'm gonna save and then I'm gonna keep gambling

4132
03:31:01,100 --> 03:31:04,100
because I want to see, like, because I feel like

4133
03:31:04,100 --> 03:31:06,100
it's gonna be very forgiving

4134
03:31:08,100 --> 03:31:11,100
when you try to gamble with a low amount.

4135
03:31:13,100 --> 03:31:15,100
Open the window and a breeze rolls in.

4136
03:31:15,100 --> 03:31:18,100
Cheers in my pants.

4137
03:31:19,100 --> 03:31:20,100
It's barely enough for the bill.

4138
03:31:20,100 --> 03:31:21,100
I was fine.

4139
03:31:23,100 --> 03:31:25,100
See, it doesn't do that much.

4140
03:31:26,100 --> 03:31:28,100
300 yen is about, like, fucking five bucks.

4141
03:31:30,100 --> 03:31:33,100
And I win, like, 50K yen because I'd be sick.

4142
03:31:38,100 --> 03:31:40,100
That works for me.

4143
03:31:42,100 --> 03:31:45,100
I want me to buy one of the girls.

4144
03:31:48,100 --> 03:31:51,100
I'll use all my money to buy them a fucking toy.

4145
03:31:52,100 --> 03:31:55,100
Oh, wait, I realized that I could have gotten, like, a make-up set.

4146
03:31:55,100 --> 03:31:57,100
It's fine.

4147
03:31:57,100 --> 03:31:59,100
Then we're gonna save.

4148
03:32:04,100 --> 03:32:06,100
And then we're gonna gamble.

4149
03:32:11,100 --> 03:32:13,100
I gotta make the money for the girlies.

4150
03:32:13,100 --> 03:32:15,100
I need to treat them, you know?

4151
03:32:16,100 --> 03:32:18,100
You know, it's called gamble heaven.

4152
03:32:22,100 --> 03:32:25,100
Let's fucking go. Let's keep going. Let's keep going. Let's keep going.

4153
03:32:26,100 --> 03:32:28,100
What are macaroons? They're really tasty.

4154
03:32:28,100 --> 03:32:30,100
I really don't know how to explain it, like, it's like a type of...

4155
03:32:30,100 --> 03:32:32,100
Is it a pastry? I don't know.

4156
03:32:32,100 --> 03:32:34,100
They're really tasty, though.

4157
03:32:34,100 --> 03:32:36,100
I like macaroons.

4158
03:32:36,100 --> 03:32:37,100
Oh, yeah!

4159
03:32:37,100 --> 03:32:40,100
Again, hit me, hit me, hit me.

4160
03:32:42,100 --> 03:32:44,100
Dealer, hit me, hit.

4161
03:32:45,100 --> 03:32:47,100
Smash the like button.

4162
03:32:47,100 --> 03:32:50,100
And subscribe below and check out my merch in my description.

4163
03:32:50,100 --> 03:32:52,100
Oh, fuck.

4164
03:33:00,100 --> 03:33:03,100
You guys can't see, but I'm doing the orange justice dance to the music.

4165
03:33:06,100 --> 03:33:09,100
All right, let's gamble.

4166
03:33:12,100 --> 03:33:14,100
Wait, they'll still let me gamble when I have no money?

4167
03:33:16,100 --> 03:33:18,100
How does that work?

4168
03:33:19,100 --> 03:33:21,100
All right, sorry, I sold one of you guys.

4169
03:33:23,100 --> 03:33:25,100
Oh, we're fine! See, we're fine.

4170
03:33:30,100 --> 03:33:32,100
I don't know how that works, but, you know...

4171
03:33:33,100 --> 03:33:35,100
Now's my time to rest up and recover.

4172
03:33:36,100 --> 03:33:38,100
This is the only place I can heal my mind.

4173
03:33:40,100 --> 03:33:42,100
I need my dick sucked.

4174
03:33:44,100 --> 03:33:46,100
Good morning!

4175
03:33:46,100 --> 03:33:47,100
Whoa, bitch!

4176
03:33:47,100 --> 03:33:49,100
Oh, you came. Thanks.

4177
03:33:50,100 --> 03:33:52,100
What drink did you want?

4178
03:33:52,100 --> 03:33:54,100
Uh, I'll just have a custard.

4179
03:33:55,100 --> 03:33:57,100
Can I have some, too?

4180
03:33:57,100 --> 03:33:58,100
No.

4181
03:33:58,100 --> 03:34:00,100
Give me Blue Girl.

4182
03:34:00,100 --> 03:34:02,100
I like how she looks like she's gonna cry every time I say no.

4183
03:34:02,100 --> 03:34:04,100
Okay, perfect. Blue Girl's coming.

4184
03:34:04,100 --> 03:34:06,100
Oh, they have cute little bunny things.

4185
03:34:06,100 --> 03:34:08,100
I like how she moonwalks in place.

4186
03:34:09,100 --> 03:34:12,100
Hey, I already forgot your name, but I started with an M.

4187
03:34:12,100 --> 03:34:14,100
Um, I got you.

4188
03:34:14,100 --> 03:34:16,100
Bunny.

4189
03:34:16,100 --> 03:34:18,100
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

4190
03:34:18,100 --> 03:34:20,100
I hope you like it.

4191
03:34:20,100 --> 03:34:24,100
It's, like, just the perfect size for humping.

4192
03:34:26,100 --> 03:34:28,100
Looks at you.

4193
03:34:28,100 --> 03:34:30,100
Really? Oh, thanks.

4194
03:34:30,100 --> 03:34:32,100
I've never really tried that before.

4195
03:34:32,100 --> 03:34:34,100
I was just plain happy.

4196
03:34:36,100 --> 03:34:37,100
What?

4197
03:34:38,100 --> 03:34:41,100
Hmm, should I hump the bunny?

4198
03:34:41,100 --> 03:34:43,100
Hmm.

4199
03:34:43,100 --> 03:34:46,100
Uh, sure, what's up?

4200
03:34:46,100 --> 03:34:48,100
You got fired.

4201
03:34:48,100 --> 03:34:50,100
No fucking shit!

4202
03:34:50,100 --> 03:34:52,100
I didn't mean to remind you.

4203
03:34:55,100 --> 03:34:57,100
Yeah, I did.

4204
03:34:57,100 --> 03:34:59,100
You're not gonna let that go, huh?

4205
03:35:00,100 --> 03:35:02,100
I'm sorry. What was your name again?

4206
03:35:04,100 --> 03:35:07,100
I'm actually hurt. I shouldn't have given you that fucking bunny.

4207
03:35:11,100 --> 03:35:13,100
She is so cold, but I love her.

4208
03:35:15,100 --> 03:35:17,100
She's better than the other two girls.

4209
03:35:18,100 --> 03:35:20,100
I know, Kanda.

4210
03:35:20,100 --> 03:35:22,100
I know, right. I know.

4211
03:35:22,100 --> 03:35:25,100
I know, right. I know.

4212
03:35:25,100 --> 03:35:27,100
So you are an android.

4213
03:35:27,100 --> 03:35:29,100
You're back again.

4214
03:35:29,100 --> 03:35:32,100
Take a girl out to dinner first, won't you?

4215
03:35:32,100 --> 03:35:35,100
Thank you.

4216
03:35:35,100 --> 03:35:37,100
Gambling fund.

4217
03:35:37,100 --> 03:35:39,100
Gambling fund?

4218
03:35:40,100 --> 03:35:42,100
Thank you, Eternity.

4219
03:35:44,100 --> 03:35:47,100
I came to see you, Mewkuchen.

4220
03:35:48,100 --> 03:35:50,100
Ew, gross.

4221
03:35:50,100 --> 03:35:52,100
Please leave.

4222
03:35:52,100 --> 03:35:55,100
Is there another customer that needs to work with me, Debra? No?

4223
03:35:55,100 --> 03:35:57,100
None of my regulars are here?

4224
03:35:57,100 --> 03:35:58,100
Oh, fine.

4225
03:35:58,100 --> 03:36:00,100
Oh, hi-dote.

4226
03:36:00,100 --> 03:36:02,100
You're a strange one.

4227
03:36:02,100 --> 03:36:05,100
You must be low on money, though.

4228
03:36:06,100 --> 03:36:08,100
Oh, I...

4229
03:36:08,100 --> 03:36:10,100
Damn.

4230
03:36:10,100 --> 03:36:12,100
Jesus fuck.

4231
03:36:13,100 --> 03:36:15,100
She is tearing me apart.

4232
03:36:17,100 --> 03:36:20,100
I'm helping out my friend now, so it's okay.

4233
03:36:20,100 --> 03:36:22,100
You don't have to worry about that.

4234
03:36:22,100 --> 03:36:24,100
I'm not worried.

4235
03:36:24,100 --> 03:36:26,100
Honestly, I don't care.

4236
03:36:26,100 --> 03:36:28,100
Oh, okay.

4237
03:36:28,100 --> 03:36:33,100
She's just so unbothered.

4238
03:36:33,100 --> 03:36:38,100
She only works this job just to insult her patrons.

4239
03:36:38,100 --> 03:36:40,100
She makes plenty of money.

4240
03:36:40,100 --> 03:36:42,100
She's like a trust fund baby.

4241
03:36:42,100 --> 03:36:45,100
She just comes here because she has a sick, twisted pleasure

4242
03:36:45,100 --> 03:36:49,100
of just acting disinterested and insulting her clients.

4243
03:36:49,100 --> 03:36:51,100
She's just so unbothered.

4244
03:36:51,100 --> 03:36:54,100
She only works this job just to insult her patrons.

4245
03:36:54,100 --> 03:36:56,100
She makes plenty of money.

4246
03:36:57,100 --> 03:37:00,100
You must spend your money wisely.

4247
03:37:00,100 --> 03:37:03,100
Do you know that I was gambling?

4248
03:37:03,100 --> 03:37:05,100
It's necessary.

4249
03:37:05,100 --> 03:37:08,100
Does she fucking know?

4250
03:37:08,100 --> 03:37:09,100
She must fucking know.

4251
03:37:09,100 --> 03:37:10,100
They must know.

4252
03:37:10,100 --> 03:37:13,100
The bots must know that when you hit a certain like below

4253
03:37:13,100 --> 03:37:15,100
and you're in a hole, they probably are like,

4254
03:37:15,100 --> 03:37:18,100
hey, man, stop gambling.

4255
03:37:18,100 --> 03:37:22,100
Yeah, I'll make sure to do that.

4256
03:37:22,100 --> 03:37:28,100
Sorry, I burped in my mouth.

4257
03:37:28,100 --> 03:37:29,100
Gross.

4258
03:37:29,100 --> 03:37:33,100
But thanks for coming here to spend that important money with me.

4259
03:37:33,100 --> 03:37:35,100
Because I deserve it and you don't.

4260
03:37:35,100 --> 03:37:37,100
Hand it over.

4261
03:37:37,100 --> 03:37:41,100
It feels strange to say you're welcome after that.

4262
03:37:41,100 --> 03:37:48,100
I keep getting acid reflux from the alcohol.

4263
03:37:48,100 --> 03:37:50,100
Ha, ha.

4264
03:37:50,100 --> 03:37:52,100
That was a really fake laugh.

4265
03:37:52,100 --> 03:37:54,100
It wasn't.

4266
03:37:54,100 --> 03:37:55,100
This is my fake laugh.

4267
03:37:55,100 --> 03:37:56,100
Ha, ha.

4268
03:37:56,100 --> 03:37:59,100
That was the same noise.

4269
03:37:59,100 --> 03:38:00,100
No, it wasn't.

4270
03:38:00,100 --> 03:38:01,100
You're different.

4271
03:38:01,100 --> 03:38:03,100
Listen closely.

4272
03:38:03,100 --> 03:38:06,100
You smiled for me again.

4273
03:38:06,100 --> 03:38:09,100
Look at her fucking straight ass face.

4274
03:38:09,100 --> 03:38:11,100
You smiled for me again.

4275
03:38:11,100 --> 03:38:14,100
Stairs.

4276
03:38:14,100 --> 03:38:16,100
Blinks looks at you.

4277
03:38:16,100 --> 03:38:18,100
Does she blink?

4278
03:38:18,100 --> 03:38:21,100
Okay, she just fluttered her pretty little lashes at me.

4279
03:38:21,100 --> 03:38:24,100
Yeah, what will you do?

4280
03:38:24,100 --> 03:38:26,100
Are you still going to drink?

4281
03:38:26,100 --> 03:38:28,100
Should I prepare some more alcohol?

4282
03:38:28,100 --> 03:38:31,100
Nah, I'm good.

4283
03:38:31,100 --> 03:38:33,100
Wow, it's already this late.

4284
03:38:33,100 --> 03:38:36,100
I'll head back home.

4285
03:38:36,100 --> 03:38:39,100
Okay, so when do I get to fuck them?

4286
03:38:39,100 --> 03:38:40,100
See ya.

4287
03:38:40,100 --> 03:38:42,100
I'll be waiting.

4288
03:38:42,100 --> 03:38:46,100
Yeah, thanks for everything and nothing and for insulting me.

4289
03:38:46,100 --> 03:38:49,100
I'm going to go cry in my pillow.

4290
03:38:49,100 --> 03:38:53,100
Yeah, see you soon.

4291
03:38:53,100 --> 03:38:55,100
Something like blah, blah, blah spent.

4292
03:38:55,100 --> 03:38:57,100
Is that true?

4293
03:38:57,100 --> 03:38:58,100
You're so funny, GBA.

4294
03:38:58,100 --> 03:38:59,100

Hoya.

4302
03:39:33,100 --> 03:39:37,100

She's a low-key freak

4400
03:47:29,900 --> 03:47:33,500
You know she'd be on the grapefruit technique because she a freak they're rhymed

4401
03:47:34,300 --> 03:47:35,940
aren't that unique

4402
03:47:35,940 --> 03:47:37,300
anyways

4403
03:47:37,540 --> 03:47:44,140
And if it's okay, would you be willing to accept this? I hope you like it really? Oh, okay. Thanks. I

4404
03:47:44,900 --> 03:47:46,900
Was just plain happy

4405
03:47:46,980 --> 03:47:49,460
Why do you like talk about your feelings?

4406
03:47:51,500 --> 03:47:55,660
Why do you talk in the in the past tense?

4407
03:48:00,660 --> 03:48:04,180
I was happy you're not happy now

4408
03:48:05,180 --> 03:48:11,700
Grapefruit patreon audio when I don't think that's not till August or July I can't remember I

4409
03:48:12,660 --> 03:48:17,060
Went crazy on that audio. Holy holy moly

4410
03:48:19,780 --> 03:48:23,940
Yeah, check out my patreon if you liked what you saw today because then

4411
03:48:25,380 --> 03:48:27,380
When I when we finally open

4412
03:48:28,540 --> 03:48:30,540
The fun place with the fans

4413
03:48:30,940 --> 03:48:34,820
Not the only those but like the ones that there's like a guy named Lee there

4414
03:48:36,220 --> 03:48:40,340
I'll probably play Hoonipop and I'll probably do a similar thing to this where I voice all the characters

4415
03:48:40,860 --> 03:48:43,940
And we get all the fun special stuff. So

4416
03:48:44,700 --> 03:48:46,460
Yeah

4417
03:48:46,460 --> 03:48:48,460
Brilliant segue. Thank you

4418
03:48:50,860 --> 03:48:55,220
Yes, nice. Oh very nice. Yes. Oh, yeah, silly fans. Yeah

4419
03:48:55,220 --> 03:48:57,220
Mm-hmm

4420
03:48:57,980 --> 03:49:03,300
That's like a peak Lee stream. Yes, you probably pop my kill me

4421
03:49:05,580 --> 03:49:08,420
Yes, I've been here for the longest out of all the cast members

4422
03:49:10,220 --> 03:49:12,140
See I told you

4423
03:49:12,140 --> 03:49:18,700
She's a she's not a she's a trust fund, baby. She also lives on our parents life insurance. That's that's all or

4424
03:49:19,700 --> 03:49:22,260
Surprised she just comes here for fun to insult people

4425
03:49:23,260 --> 03:49:32,020
What's the issue because of the way I am is it because you're not good at making small talk in your vat at serving customers

4426
03:49:34,580 --> 03:49:37,180
Dude what the fuck you have to say that

4427
03:49:41,020 --> 03:49:44,500
Yeah, how have you been here so long you're just shit and talking to people

4428
03:49:45,580 --> 03:49:48,980
But you're an idiot. I hate you. Don't ever come again

4429
03:49:49,100 --> 03:49:52,900
So that's how you prove what the fuck just happened

4430
03:50:00,380 --> 03:50:06,580
So that's how you perceive me no, no, I'm sorry, that's not what I think of you at all, although I said it out loud

4431
03:50:08,860 --> 03:50:13,940
And it wasn't even like a dub from the person voicing me right now, I'm just a dick

4432
03:50:15,500 --> 03:50:17,500
That's okay. You're right anyway

4433
03:50:19,860 --> 03:50:21,860
He he oh

4434
03:50:22,140 --> 03:50:24,140
Were you just messing with me?

4435
03:50:24,780 --> 03:50:26,780
Because it was kind of hot

4436
03:50:27,100 --> 03:50:29,100
Tell me you hate me some more

4437
03:50:29,620 --> 03:50:32,700
Yes, I was teasing you, but I actually do hate you

4438
03:50:36,980 --> 03:50:40,660
Do you want some alcohol, what should I do is there anything I should prepare?

4439
03:50:41,820 --> 03:50:43,260
Yeah

4440
03:50:43,260 --> 03:50:46,700
My efforts have been rewarded. I want to drink something delicious

4441
03:50:47,700 --> 03:50:51,140
What drink did you want? Um, I would like a

4442
03:50:52,620 --> 03:50:54,140
Woman's Sour

4443
03:50:54,140 --> 03:50:56,140
It's a highball

4444
03:50:56,700 --> 03:50:58,700
Actually, yeah

4445
03:51:00,780 --> 03:51:07,020
We got money I can't take a picture. I don't think I can take a picture. How do I take pictures?

4446
03:51:08,780 --> 03:51:11,780

You can have whatever you want. Wait, I'll give you some wine

4448
03:51:16,700 --> 03:51:22,700
If I got like this again, would that just like fuck me up? Like would I just be like in debt to the like what I have to like

4449
03:51:23,900 --> 03:51:32,020

4452
03:51:46,360 --> 03:51:50,000
Don't press the right key. Don't press the right. Don't press right click

4453
03:51:51,320 --> 03:51:53,320
That's all I'm gonna say

4454
03:51:53,600 --> 03:51:55,600
Just fuck that off for me

4455
03:51:56,480 --> 03:51:58,480
Here's another present. Oh fuck

03:51:59,720 --> 03:52:01,720
I'll shout with you

4457
03:52:03,440 --> 03:52:06,520
Boy whore arc, let's go. Do you have friends? No

4458
03:52:07,640 --> 03:52:09,640
Well, it's not like you have any friends either

4459
03:52:10,640 --> 03:52:15,120
Uh, yeah, I do the work I'm doing is all through a connection with my friend

4460
03:52:15,720 --> 03:52:18,560
That my parents totally didn't pay to be friends with me

4461
03:52:19,480 --> 03:52:23,760
You do have friends. That's unexpected. You kind of seem like a loser

4462
03:52:24,600 --> 03:52:25,840
Damn

4463
03:52:25,840 --> 03:52:28,880
You have to be so harsh. Why is that so surprising?

4464
03:52:30,080 --> 03:52:37,880
You're the type of guy who gets fired. I figured might make a mess with friendships as well. Jesus. Why is she cooking me?

4465
03:52:39,880 --> 03:52:41,880
I

4466
03:52:44,920 --> 03:52:46,920
Like I feel personally attacked

4467
03:52:48,800 --> 03:52:53,480
But it makes sense because all you guys are fucking subs and she's a fucking she's fucking insult

4468
03:52:53,480 --> 03:52:56,720
You know, you're all getting off on it. Yeah, I bet you fucking like it

4471
03:53:07,440 --> 03:53:10,920
Well, what a terrible thing to say

4472
03:53:13,200 --> 03:53:16,000
Do you have any friends me you kitchen

4473
03:53:17,200 --> 03:53:19,200

4479
03:53:36,840 --> 03:53:38,840

4484
03:54:02,080 --> 03:54:05,200
Also a bitch to your friend that makes a lot of sense that that checks out

4485
03:54:06,200 --> 03:54:09,120
To other cast members, huh? Why are they called cast members?

4486

4507
03:56:19,880 --> 03:56:24,160
I'll be honest with you. I was like, I feel like I'm not gonna enjoy myself with this game

4508
03:56:24,760 --> 03:56:26,760
And I did actually

4509
03:56:29,480 --> 03:56:32,400
I had a lot of fun dubbing with it, that's hilarious

4510
03:56:34,640 --> 03:56:37,440
Let me make sure I can redirect into a zero when she goes live

4511
03:56:49,280 --> 03:56:53,600
Aren't you funny anonymous tipped $4 and 20 cents

4512
03:56:54,160 --> 03:56:57,360
Thanks, Shabuya. I think this might be your best stream yet

4513
03:56:59,120 --> 03:57:01,680
Shabuya I didn't even listen to the rest of it. I

4514
03:57:03,040 --> 03:57:06,160
Think this might be your best tree. I agree with that. I agree with that statement

4515

Everybody calls me everything besides my own name

4518
03:57:17,360 --> 03:57:27,600
Dubbing was too hilarious. I wish you could do more jobs like this. Oh, yeah, that's what I feel like when play when you pop

4519
03:57:27,600 --> 03:57:29,600
It's gonna be really fucking hilarious

4520
03:57:30,440 --> 03:57:32,440
Great stream. Thank you. Thank you

4521
03:57:33,320 --> 03:57:35,320
Here's another kind of bad

4522
03:57:35,600 --> 03:57:37,600
Restel acting made this stream amazing

4523
03:57:38,600 --> 03:57:40,600
I'm something of an actor myself

4524
03:57:40,840 --> 03:57:44,960
Shabrit any what a goat

4525
03:57:46,960 --> 03:57:48,360
Sheeps

4526
03:57:48,360 --> 03:57:50,360
Do they allow who you pop on YouTube?

4527
03:57:50,440 --> 03:57:54,880
They actually do they allowed like when you do like the censored version, but I could play

4528
03:57:55,480 --> 03:57:57,480
the uncensored version on

4529
03:57:57,600 --> 03:57:59,600
The Lee's fan site

4530
03:58:02,920 --> 03:58:05,320
I mean if you play who you pop I'll be there hands down

4531
03:58:06,040 --> 03:58:11,800
And I want to play because I've never played like an h-game before so I think it would be

4532
03:58:12,280 --> 03:58:15,640
Really fun. Sorry. I'm like switching between windows. I was adjusting chat

4533
03:58:18,640 --> 03:58:20,640
Shabizi

4534
03:58:21,000 --> 03:58:23,520
That's my that's my my street name

4535
03:58:25,080 --> 03:58:26,920
Shabizi

4536
03:58:26,920 --> 03:58:33,080
No, I never know actually I've never played I said this before but I bought who need pop like

4537
03:58:34,080 --> 03:58:38,400
Do you remember in like PewDiePie played it like all those years ago?

4538
03:58:38,600 --> 03:58:42,240
That is when I bought it and I have not touched it since I bought it. I

4539
03:58:43,240 --> 03:58:45,240
Have never played the game. I

4540
03:58:48,160 --> 03:58:50,400
Don't even know why the fuck I never did I

4541
03:58:51,680 --> 03:58:55,200
Think I was like meaning to play it a couple of times

4542
03:58:56,520 --> 03:58:59,320
Oh my god, I just looked outside and the way the Sun is setting

4543
03:58:59,320 --> 03:59:04,240
I thought a building was on fire because the way it's reflecting. Holy shit. That was so I was like what?

4544
03:59:06,520 --> 03:59:12,240
But yeah, really I'm very happy you guys enjoyed that was really fucking fun. I need to figure out

4545
03:59:12,240 --> 03:59:16,800
I can't wait to hear your dumb for the week. Oh, yeah, like I like I watch like I watch

4546
03:59:17,720 --> 03:59:19,720
Markiplier and PewDiePie play it

4547
03:59:21,120 --> 03:59:25,320
So like I know the premise and like what to expect and all that other stuff

4548
03:59:25,320 --> 03:59:30,200
And I've been playing a lot of match three games thanks to mercy because mercy edit

4549
03:59:30,200 --> 03:59:33,560
I didn't realize what it like it was called a match three game

4550
03:59:33,560 --> 03:59:35,480
And I'm like, oh, I haven't played one of these in a long time

4551
03:59:35,720 --> 03:59:38,880
You just play like bust a move and like like peggel and shit

4552
03:59:40,360 --> 03:59:42,360
Mmm peggel um

4553
03:59:43,120 --> 03:59:47,960
No, I was playing this I was playing this game. It's I think it's called bunny garden as well

4554
03:59:48,320 --> 03:59:50,320
It's been a bunny who plants gardens

4555
03:59:51,320 --> 03:59:53,320
It's very cute

4556
03:59:53,720 --> 03:59:55,720
I'm on like

4557
03:59:55,720 --> 04:00:01,000
