{"text": " I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Bruh. Everything is breaking right now. Holy crap. Everything has broken. I can't even hear in-game sound. I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be here in the music right now. Hold on. I'm so sorry. Everything broke from yesterday. And my headset isn't registering sound at all. I knew it wasn't. You're lying to me. Oh, the scuff isn't working. Oh, here we go. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. No, I just had to test it with some music. Okay. I can now hear the title music? Yes, I can. And you can hear it too. I don't know how loud it's going to be though. Oh my god. Anything that can break will. Well, I didn't change a single thing from yesterday's drum. Oh, I apologize for being late. Little refunds. That was horrific. I haven't even been able to watch yesterday's words. I know the next stream is starting. How are we meant to keep up with your strongy? That's the fun part. I have endless stamina. See, those details come really good later on. Right, I don't, I need to, I mean, I'll tell you what world we're in. Right now I'm entering world 424. But I want tutorial island. So please don't worry. What was that first song? It was called Music Makes You Lose Control. Music makes you lose control. Let's go. Please don't worry if you've not actually got your character outside good ol' Lummi Castle, Lumbridge Castle. I've not even done the tutorial part. I do. I'm playing with a plugin called Runelight. But we're just going through tutorial island super quick. I'm not. Oh no, I just liked it a brand new. Oh, we're doing an indepth in tutorial island then. Ah. Ah. I've actually been smart and I've prepared a whole meal. It was absolutely chaos getting, like, I was trying to get Runelight to work on screen and I was trying to cook fricking my, well, technically my breakfast, but I call it dinner. But, and I actually have, like, the world's saddest fricking rose, I think it's called, like, rosemary sauce when you have it with shrimp. And, ah. So, I do have membership. As is in the finalized world, please, I've not even got through this tutorial. Right, let me just skip through this fricking tutorial. Oh, my phone's in the way. Oh, my God, no. I can't skip this. This is going to take so long. Oh, right. Yes, we'll talk to the survival specialist. Look, that's what I'm eating right now. Unironically, I'm eating that right now. I'm good. Wait a minute. This game's based on real life. How cool is that? We're going fishing. Would you fish me up? Huh? But anyway, good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. I apologize. It's been fricking chaos. Since there is no work tomorrow, I'm commit to catch the full stream today. No way. Thank you for the tip, Virginia. There is no way. Literally. Oh, ace the con, Snow Bear June, as well. Thank you for the tip. I'm about to munch on. I've got bex, pate, oh. Right. And then I've got shrimp. And then I've got a rose, a sauce, while I've not made it correctly, because I didn't fricking squeeze the water out of the prawns. Hi, ready? Hi, ready? Hi, acey and Snowberry Raiders. But if you put all those words together, it becomes reading. Are you splitting me right now? Strony. You're eating marshmallows last night inspired me to try to write something to make your heart flutter, because I think it's adorable. Are you going to read more tonight? I can definitely read more. Thank you very much, Gramble, for the tip. Yeah, I can definitely read more. Oh, I'm sorry to... Trying to eat and beat and vape and do everything all at once. Hi, we're playing RuneScape, an old-school RuneScape. We're going to play multiplayer and do quests together. I am called Scottlefish, because I totally did not steal that from a roofling. Thank you very much. But yeah, we're going to do good. I am not... I'm going to move to a free world, but if you want to make a new account, we are going to do, like, the free quest, like, Cook's Assistant and that. Where the heck am I supposed to go? I don't know. I'm not paying attention. Now that you have logged, it's time to light fire. Oh, okay, pardon me. Pardon me, excuse me. I'm going to take a bite. Ah. Hi, it's Trombone. What a nickname. I should have thrown it that bad. See? So I've got this plugin called RuneLight. And, at least, it's really good. I think it's really good. If the game needs to be louder, please do tell me. I actually think it does need to be louder. Because I'm, like, screaming over all the things. What next? Moving on. Well done. Moving on. Moving on. I've completely forgotten how the tutorial goes, because it's been so long. I'ma take another bite of my food. But, yeah, if you want to join in, don't worry, you can literally make a character right now and be faster than me. I will tell you what world we're on. We're all going to meet outside of Lumbridge Castle. So whenever what world we'll get, we will do a Chicky Lumbridge Castle. And then we'll take it one by one and we'll quest. Right? Let's start with Cook's Assistant, because, obviously, this is a bit squished. And my goal is to get 99 cooking live. Like, not in this one stream. Okay, not in this one stream. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't know how to do that. Although, I think of Fletching. If you have, like, a ton of GP, you can actually get 99 Fletching in one day or something like that. I can't remember. I think it's Fletching. You can kind of smurf of it, smurf of the cheese of it. All in one stream, crazy. No, no, stop getting hype. It's not happening in one stream. Okay, quest journal. Yep, you're going to do the free quest first as best as we can. And then we might move on to membership quest, but I do want to give Beefling the chance to come hang at Lummi Castle, the glum castle. Any, any lummers? Any hashtag, a lummer? I'm taking a little bit. It's super expensive for a member. Yeah, it's really expensive, actually, to do the thing, but, um, membership in this game is so expensive. I remember I asked my mum to buy me membership when I was away, and it was, like, cheap as anything, and she never got me it, because she didn't understand what the game was, and she was like, why do you need it? Why do you need it? I'm like, mum! I want membership! Ryan! No way! Are you... You must have been so many iron reaper that I managed to get an eight hour sleep after that stream. I don't know how long the endurance stream... It was, like, three quid the last time I got it. Honestly, I remember, like, begging my mum, I was like, mum! I want membership, but she never understood my games. And then that's when I go to Dad. See, Dad, Dad knew. Dad knew what was going on. He knew the games. Mum and Dad! What were we doing? I'm not talking, I'm right. Hello, my name is Skullfish! I still live. I usually sleep four or five. You guys all insomniacs, I got four hours. Good enough for me. Bro, that's not healthy, honestly. I woke up and I felt sick today, and I was like, is that because you will be told to equip items later? You don't have access to the interface for equipment items? Oh, okay, one more, thank you. Right, shovel on now. Oh, okay. Are you squiddin' me right now? Brian! No! Oh, I actually quite like that sentiment. Thank you, Tim Shortle. I think Tim Shortle's the way I'm supposed to say it, because there's no way it's like any other way. Right, let's go. Combat interface, right? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, beautiful, let's stab. Give him a little stabby stab. Damn rats. All right, hold on, hold on. Nope, too far, too far. Inbought, inbought. I... Whenever I've watched RuneScape Streamers, they're always super zoomed in. They're like, oh yeah, look at that. And I'm like, bro, I need to be able to see what I'm looking at. I can see the health bar, I can see everything, and we battle down the area. I'm not setting anything up before anyone complains. Chat sleep. Chat needs to rest as much as me. I've got absolutely no sleep at all. Are you all insomniacs? You're all... Literally all holding on for the ASMR stream. I'm getting my nails done after the ASMR stream. So I hope you're all ready. Wait, what am I supposed to do? Oh no, wait, sorry. I'm supposed to do range weaponry. Can I do it from through the gate? Oh, I can. It's cheating. Didn't realize old-school room shape... Oh, didn't realize old-school RuneScape membership is 8'9\". No! Bro, the inflation has hands. I'm sorry, but... All these things being like, oh no, cost of living. Well, you're not paying your pay... You're not paying your employees more. So I don't know why we're pretending the cost of living is a thing for these companies. That's it also. You're doing your nails for the sweet-eating stream. Uh, yeah. How else are you going to, you know, do my hands? You need to be able to imagine my hand wrapped around... That's terrible. We're just started. I was doing a lot of food filming. Oh my god, I'm rich! I'm rich! We're rich! I've got 25 coins. Are you squeezing me right now? Brian! That's because I had problems sleeping. Thank you for the tip, Tharya. Oh my god. Right, so you can do voting. Like, if you're like hardcore, well, it's not really actually, but it's actually quite quick to get the... Oh, I've just skipped past the bit that tells you. Oh, what should we vote on? Should Firelight a new level 77 demon bait? Bro, I... I've not... Whoa, these are like the same question, but different. I have not... I have not played enough RuneScape. I'm like the basic RuneScape part, okay? Before you think I'm going to start getting prayer pots out, I'm going to start, uh, what is it called? Like, PKN. No, I'm not PKN. I'm not doing that. I'm not happening. No, I'm called Squatfish. I've got membership 30 days left. Oh, no, you can't see it because I'm a big ass, hey. Who's grabbing this? What world? Okay, world can hold 2,000 members. Okay. We're very lucky, but I don't think there's 2,000 recently available at StreamSnipe. So, uh, the good thing... Oh god, it's probably a bit too heavy. Please don't show my email and password. That would kind of suck. But then again, let's just throw away the purpose. On the way to victory, to victory, to victory. I'm on the way to victory. So, into the church I go. Hello, mister... Hello, Mr. Brace. Any bracers? What is PKN? Player killing. It's when you attack players and you sell the goods that they drop, basically. But, uh, before anyone thinks I'm going to turn into PKN, yeah, good luck, mate. That's what happens. I'm doing this tutorial right now. I'm going to eat my food outside Lumbridge so everyone can get a chance to group up if you want to start on a new account if you can go questing together. So please don't panic if you think, like, oh no, I've not got enough time to join in. You absolutely do. I am going to make it so. I eat my foodies. I've got a cola and two bottles of water with me. Um, as for those of you interested, if this is, uh, an... Where the heck? Oh, it's... Where the heck am I supposed to go? It's not blinking anything. I'm grabbing the booze. You will be shown how to cast spells. When you get there, just talk to the magic instructor. I assume you can hear them. Oh, of course it pops up. What are we doing? I'll hop on. We're going to just do basic questing because I've started a fresh account and we're going to try and get 99 Kooten. However, open up your final menu. Ah! Am I done? Okay, not yet. We're about to teleport to Lummi and then I'll pick a free-to-play server. Um, and... Oh my god, I'm casting the chicken. You wouldn't cast the chicken, would you? Would you? Who goes there? Everyone has some when you trust a lure into the world, eh? Can I? I'm so sorry, but I'm going to confess my biggest sin, and you guys honestly aren't ready for it. I used to be double in money and take people's money. The biggest amount I ever took was 100K gold and then I stopped. I don't know how I didn't get banned. I think because I did it in such low increments. Um... Right, send me to the mainland. I'm so sorry. I used to be the one at the Grand Exchange. I was like a little kid because what happened was I got fricking scammed. Hey, Scottfish, come over here. Adventure or John? Um, I got scammed and then I realized, wait, I can just scam other people to get my money back! Double in gold! Double in gold! And I'm like, I got all the money I lost back. It's time. Officers, it's her. Literally, I was like a little nine-year-old hustler, like, like, oh, it's terrible. So if you ever got done at the Grand Exchange because you were a silly, silly McGee, guess what? It was probably me! We're gonna hang out at this fountain at Lummi Castle right here. We're gonna hang out at the little fountain. I am going to Swap World. Wait, why is it flashing? It's... Why it's flashing? Right, what world are we gonna go to? I'll make it a free-to-play world. Where... How do I... Change worlds? Whoa! Oh, wait, wait, wait. I think World Shifter's up here. Okay! Um... Free-to-play trade? No, it's got 900 people in it already. Do we want free-to-play trade? There's 900 people in it? Jagex is watching you now. They better not be! I'm in trouble. We're gonna hang out at Lummi Castle until I've finished my dinner. I'm trying to eat it on my breakfast. Everything's set. What world do we want? Free-to-play is good. Right, we'll just do the classic free-to-play trade-free world 301. There's 900 folk in it, so we've got all the room in the world. Take me... Are you sure you wish to go to World 301? Yes, sir! Let's... Let's cycle! Okay. I don't know where the heck the reef ones are, so we'll come a little over to the fountain. Oh, no! What are they used? I don't know. We might need to... I don't know. I don't want... Are these reeflings in game? Wait, wait, wait. We're gonna go over to the tree to make sure these are reeflings. Holy crap, are they? Brian! Evening, Alessandro. Thank you for the tip. Oh, my God! They're reeflings! Oh, my God. Oh, you're looking at... Oh, my God. Wait, you guys are actual... Some of you are actual players, though. Oh, why are you so high level? Oh, someone's got tiny cuttles. That's funny. Wait, you guys are like actual... I miss Fauna. It's such a good name. Oh, my God. Just yummy. Hello, hello. Oh, my God. You guys are like actual skillers and stuff. Good morning, reeflings. They're saying, Oh, that's crazy. Strony surprise attack gamers. I know, but I didn't know if you guys were going... Oh, my God. You stole my drip. You look like me. Oh, you guys... You get stood on. I see a Strony. You guys are like so high level. That's amazing. You guys should probably teach me how to play the game. Unfortunately, we can't... What is that? Why is he standing like that? What does it mean? Am I to raid him like a pony? Oh, the guy's got the magma cape. I've never done the magma cape before. I have a stupid snowflake account. So I won't join. What does that mean? I have a snowflake account. Steals her legs. Snowflake, by the way. What does that mean? Oh, my God. Look at your fit. Your outfit's so unique. You're holding a puppy. And you've got like little things going on on you. Right. A lot of you are like over leveled like heck. What is this in his hand? A fish. Is that me in his hand? Come on, guys. Oh, why is your name that? Oh, no. Why would you rename yourself? Oh, no. Trick or treat. Let me take. I don't think I get... We want to see what you got, Sans. Show us what you got whilst I eat my dinner. Where did he go? Wait, did he just disappear because I looked down for one second? It says you guys want to trade me, but I don't think I can trade because I'm a new account. I don't think it works. I think I need to go quest and to like unlock trade. If you guys are wanting to give me anything. Is it in the stream to trade? Yeah, like I don't think you guys can trade me anything. So don't worry. We're going to go quest and RIP, yeah. Wait, I'm getting the fish. There's so many riblings. Hello, riblings. Thank you, everyone that can join. Yo, we're deforestation out here. Oh, they leveled up. Let's go. Okay. Trick it is. Jeez. Yeah, look. Accept trade. I don't think you can trade because I'm a new, new, new account. What? Are you giving me? A rope and a fish? Are you telling me? Are you doing that? No way. You can trade that. No way. I have a fricking rope in my inventory right now. Wait, can you only give me like World 301? Yeah, this world is full sad. Why? Oh, the world is full. Okay. Wait, wait, hold on. Right, we're going to move to... We're not doing... I don't know what these are. The regular bought items can't be traded. Okay, we're learning. Right. The world is full, so we're going to go to an emptier one. Everyone get ready. High risk world. Yeah, no thanks. I have a bow. Is there like a really easy one we can get inside? Clan Wars? I don't know. Do we get grouped on? Are we technically a clan? No. These are just dead Oz servers apparently? Are these American? 380. Someone says 380. Hold on. 380. Right. World 380. And we're going to Brit Bungland. Right, let's go 380. World 380. Wait, I'm double clicking. Let me go. 380. Grand exchanges limited to until you do quests or play for a while. Now you have the fish. You're canonically strong. Okay, okay. Oh, look at the replays. Okay. World 380. How do you dance? Oh my God. It's been so long. How do you dance? I want to dance too. I can dance. I'm sure I can dance. Hold on. Let's go. Grand. Little dance. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. What? What? I'm stunning on them. I'm stunning on them. Look at them. Whoa. What in the pivot axis was that? That was awful. Don't ever do that again. Right, we're clapping. Okay, now dance honestly. Grand exchanges limited to 8. That's not a clan. That's an army. Oh yeah? Will we do the refland clan and we'll go pk'ing like other clans or something? As if I know how the combat works. This only world where the text matters is PvP, high-risk, total and demo. Right. Are you ready to do the first official quest? Or I say that as if I've even hardly eaten any of my dinner. Hold on. I'm trying to eat but I'm such a blabbermouth. Honestly. I can't stop. I'm glad the refland's not stacking into one space. Astroni can appreciate them each. Yeah. I'm still convinced that guy wants me to ride him. Because he's like a horse, literally. I'm so cute. Still got people doing tutorials. Yeah, don't worry if you're still doing tutorial island. I'm gonna inhale my dinner really quickly. I'm gonna try my best. What is that noise? You're all making noises. I can't believe it. I'm driving the bug. I'm still trying to log in. You're not giving people time to do the tutorial. Only the players flexing their heads. How many? Oh my god. Oh, that's just an MBC hand. Oh, someone just leveled up. Look at how high level you guys are. Literally got the pepper, the frog over there. I love mummy. Oh my god. Sad. Like you're your name. Just Yome. You guys are like actual gamers. Oh my god. You're much better than me. I'm like scared to play the game. I'm like you guys are gonna show me off. Quality player is determined by their agility and rune crafting level. Yeah, yeah. No one likes rune crafting. You're not selling it here. Get your propaganda useless out of here because you're not. Rune crafting is the worst. Unless you literally have an entire army behind you to help. It ain't happening. At the end of the stream you'll be that high level. Ah, I think not. Yeah, I need to have agility. 89. You're really good at going in a circle then. Jeez. My brother was a Rinscape essence slaver for years. Do you pay to like carry the thing? Just don't please tell me. Banks are for squares. Are you an iron man? Oh, so there's different types of players you can be. If you're an iron man it means you don't have access to bank or something like that. Guardians of the Rift is experienced also. It's also experienced. So will this be a 28 hour marathon? No, no, I don't think it's a marathon. I said yesterday I thought it was a marathon but I woke up and I don't actually feel that well today. I can't believe it. I can't believe streaming for 12 hours making me feel a bit wonky. I don't know why because essentially I would sit at the PC and work on like it and for like ASMR or something like that. But why is it when a streamer feels sick? Like it doesn't make sense. I feel weak in stream height honestly. Free cuttlefish mustache rights here. That's awful. Oh, how did you... What? Ah, are you just cuttlefish right in front of us? I didn't know Rinscape had emotes like this. More active for streaming. Maybe because you did it three times this week. Me? Isn't every strong stream technically a marathon honestly? Damn, how does one become an essence run slave? That's good money for that hour. The members emotes go hard. Strong party. Heck yeah. There's so many reflings. The servers are like who on earth are all these people? D refling. I'll read out your name if it's refling related, but I was trying not to accidentally say anything. Who is leveling up there? Freaking... I can hear someone leveling up and it's always going doot doot doot doot doot doot. Hello? Jack the Ripper's coming to get us lads. We're done for. Maybe it was your screaming yesterday, bro. I was so annoyed. I listened back. I didn't realise how angry I got. Like I got angry. Wow. Oh, it's a skill cape or more? Oh my god, he's got the fishing skill cape. Ah, jacquem prongs. Jacquem prongs, wee wee. What is this freaking UFO over here? What is that? Oh, is that prey? Is that questing? You've done all quests. Oh, you've got all the jelly. Oh my god. Wait, what's the cooking one? Does anyone have 99 cooking? What's the cooking or more? Oh, I can't wait to get it. Oh, look at us all. Well, binchinning. Binchinning. How do I change servers? Um... I'm on the runelight, so it's plug-in, so it's up here. But if you're not on the runelight plug-in, it's... Down the bottom somewhere. Smile. It's on the cog, I think. I have two baked potatoes. I've not even finished the first one, and it's frickin' totey. Like, it's so small. I'm trying so I can't eat and talk, and it'd be entertaining at the same time. Quest cape, quest cape. Ah. Max capers shaming us all. Click the top right eggs, then you'll see worlds switcher on the bottom. The door icon to hop worlds is what they're saying. Refillins are so MLG pro, honestly. Like, we're not even gay people. Oh, you're so green! This refilling's, like, literally so green. That's amazing. Maybe we should... Amala to tell us to all go buy green capes. For strawney. And then we all just walk around with green capes, and, like, whenever we pass someone, they'll be like, huh, what's going on over there? Why are they all doing their thing? Wishes to trade with you. So, I can't accept anything outside of, like, regular trades. I know. You get... You're giving me your crusty cum sock. No! No! Wait. I have a crusty cum sock on my inventory. How did you even get that? Okay. Gently used. Literally gently used. Right. I'm gonna eat. I'm gonna save maybe a five-minute countdown, and then we're gonna start with Cook's insistent, and we'll take it from there. So, for those of you who haven't made an account, we are on World 380. And we're outside Lung Bridge Castle. When you spawn in, we are literally just... You'll spawn in this way, and we're the left of the castle. We're just hanging out here, because we don't want to bother anyone that might be spawning in over here. But I'm starting with the character's pink hair, or my same pink. Mine has ginger hair. Like, I'm a junior. Which thing? And then I've got green top, and then pink... I think... Prepared to get billied nerds! I'm trying to eat so fast. It's hard. Honestly. I hope you guys have got hydration and eating. I don't know if it's an endurance stream yet. Okay. But... Ginger hair, cute outfit, and a rope. Yeah, yeah. You can get at me. 380. Yeah, 380. The refling in the game, of course, is gonna be... Don't stop until you get 99. Bro, you think I can stream until 99? Cooking? I don't even know how to, like, maximise cooking. The closest I ever got was, like, 80, but I'd rather do it live with you guys. Buying girlfriend 50 gold. What happened to party hats? I don't remember people were, like, renting party hats in quotation marks. I don't know what that means at all. Delicious coke. I say delicious as if... it's just not a regular fizzy juice. Well, actually, it's, like, one of the most popular fizzy juices, so... They decided not to have exclusive one-time items. Oh, even though they're tradable? I guess they didn't, like, give enough out? Possible? They can... They became common. Oh! They made it common. You go to a good place for cooking and you cook till the number says 99, or you run out of money. With some of the fish. Okay, you're done. Oh, people are getting, uh... minigames. I was, like, I'm saying, come along with me, Miss... I Miss Fauna. Wakey-wakey, I Miss Fauna. Max Capers. How much playtime? 232 days says one. 314 says another. I can't believe my little... My little reeflings are adorable little nerds! I can't believe it! You can do just a feckin' adorable! Any language game? That's so precious. I'm glad you found a game that you really enjoy and can, uh, throw yourself inside. It's... When you find that game, it's really nice. Anyway, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, let's get started. Mmm. Yesterday, Avatar, No Capitalist Simulator. This is all really a trust. Someone says 63 days, and I haven't even left this area, uh, someone says 1,650 hours for a total of 1,800... I can't read numbers. Uh, big number. Big hours for big number. Thank you. Mmm. Well, more reeflings? Have we got more reeflings joining us? Yeah? Someone's got... Oh, someone literally is called Swiss Oak. A snowflake among snowflakes. Wait, what am I missing? What is this? Is this, like, super runescape terms that I don't know about yet? Or is this literally, uh, take the word heart and remove the H and replace... Remove the H and E and replace it with an F. Relax, snowflake. It's called Dark Humor. Is that the joke? Or am I missing Platinum? Respect for the Iron Man. Snowflake accounts are accounts that have extremely restrictive stipulations. What does that even mean? You've somehow... You can't... Snowflake is a special account. Wait, the Venezuelans are the snowflakes? Game is not degen enough. We need to make it harder. What the heck? Honestly. I think this girl in crossbones means this guy's a p-care over here. I'm okay. Can only do content in a region. Jeez. One guy's playing the game where if he takes damage, all... Oh, I know! Uh, the... Swamplet X guy. Yeah. I've not actually watched that series. The No Hits run series, but, yeah. Region locked. Oh, settle! That's his name, not Swamplet X. I have still not finished the first fucking potato. I'm actually getting annoyed now. Why is the food not getting away off my plate? I'm inhaling it. I'm so sorry. I'm just gonna have to send it. I can't. I'm getting too distracted trying to, like, talk into this. I'm sending it. This is the fastest freaking eating you'll ever hear of me. I'm chewing. I'm chewing. I've got another bit of potato. I've never done this. And, um... Okay, I've had enough of eating. I'm already bored of it. I should weigh myself, honestly, just so I don't lose too much weight, because I stream too much. I was actually wondering about that, because I've not had a proper meal. I'm, like, ages... Ow. I'll cut, I'll cut. Done. I'm a finger blade for my fucking plate. I've tried to eat it. It's taken too long. Right. Okay. I was trying to eat a baked potato in prawns, and it was just taken forever. Oh, I've had enough. Right. Is this everyone who wants to show up? Um, can chat, talk to me, and tell me, is everyone here that wants to be here?

I'll read it out for you as for those of you that are blind. Cook's assistant. I can start this quest by talking to the Cook Lumberge Castle. Difficulty novice. Very short. Release 2001. Jeez. Storyline. Stand alone. No requirements and no none. Wait, someone else wishes to trade. I don't, you guys can't give me like main stuff. I am. I'm going to head to bed early.

Come reflings. You can follow me if you want. Wait. Who are we fighting? Why are you fighting that per man? Right. Oh my God. Women's simulator. Time to head to the kitchen. Oh my God. There's so many. Right. This cook is like, why are all you people in my kitchen right now? Right. Yes. Cook. What's wrong, Mr. Cook? Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear. I'm in terrible trouble with mess. It's the Duke's birthday today and I should be making him a big, lovely birthday cake. I've forgotten to buy the ingredients. I'll never get them now. He'll sack me. What will I do? I have four children and I go look after. Honestly. Me with the... What? What? I have five babies but one of them is a goat. He has four babies and a goat. What are the odds? Yes. We're going to help Cook's assistant. Yes. I'll help you. Oh great. Oh. My little quest helper just popped up. Where do I find these ingredients? I think I remember where they are so I think we can just walk away. Do I need to pick up a pit? I think... Do we need this jug? Wait. Are we all going to be fighting over the same jug? Do we not need a jug for this quest to put the milk in? Save yourself and run. Buy eggs here. 100 cold coins. Sell an egg. No. Do we not have to pick up the big egg and the milk from the dairy? Am I going crazy? Isn't that like one special big egg and one special thing? I've got 25. Best I can offer. Real cheap. People are thinking you are doing a drop party or something. All the folk following. Oh. No idea. I'm like... Yo. You guys have money? I can go get some jugs and drop them. Man's running a scheme. I respect it honestly. Are you guys grabbing all his equipment? Okay. Right. We can take off and get the egg. Go to the front of the castello. If everyone has accepted that quest, we'll go to the front. I think they changed it. Okay. Right. Oh no. It does look like we're a drop party. I'm broke so I can't afford any eggs. Don't worry. I'm going to take you to the egg factory. It's me. Plop. Plop. Plop. Plop. Plop. Plop. Okay. Oh my God. We look like a drop party so badly. Right. We're going to the river. The chickens aren't going to stand a chance. Yeah. So the cow milk and the eggs are across the river. If you follow me... Oh my God. Strongly lays eggs. I was going to do ovate deposit. I'm not even going to pretend otherwise. We call these people hurting the goblins. Il goblina village. We're going to milk a cow. Milk the cow. Milk the cow. We need it straight from the teeth. You know? A normal egg works just fine. Yes. Has YouTube ceased the culling? I think so. We actually are submitting for monetization today. Can I milk your cow or do I need a bucket? Oh, I milked it. But that's because I had a jug? Wait. Did I milk it or am I going crazy? She goes, Teehee, you've never milked a cow before. How could you tell? Because you're spilling milk. What a waste. You need something to hold the milk. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. Where'd you get a bucket in this game? Right. Right. We'll go get the eggs then. Eggs first. We'll deal with a bucket problem in a minute. Buckets are from the tutorial. Worked for me. I don't have a bucket. Oh, no. I already have a bucket of milk. What the heck? I already have a bucket. I've already got a bucket of milk in my inventory. I don't know why she said that to me. Cheeky rat, honestly. Egg time. Egg time. We go get the eggs. We go get the eggs. That's the only thing about the RuneScape plugin. I can see the price of everything. You guys want to watch me beat up a chicken? That's right. Violence. Violence. Rage against the machine. Take this. Oh, I just killed it with Kung Fu. That's right. And I know three other dangerous ones. I didn't drop an egg. All right. Okay. Let's all beat up the chickens and get eggs. Beat the chickens up. We're going to gang violence these chickens. Literally the whole gang of us coming. Someone's casting Shadow Wizard Money Gang. We love casting spells on chickens. Oh, my God. There's like so much. It's just hard to see anything. Oh, my God. I need to like zoom right in. Beat that chicken up. No, you stole my chicken. Wait. I'm going to take this egg. Right. I have an egg. I have an egg. So I'm going to stand here because I've got one.

How's the treasure hunt going? I found the treasure. Excellent. Oh, I've got an ancient casket. Ah! I have no clue. I've got three total quest points. We've got an antique lamp, 200 coal. Oh, we've got a closed scroll. Do we all get the same closed scroll? Near the open desert, I reside to get past me, you must abide. Go forward if you dare for when you pass me. You'll be sweating by your hair. No. Dungeon master. Is that an easy quest? Was our next easy free to play quest? Hmm. That was...dark. I've got one about an anagram of how I need to speak tonight. Oh my god, this music is so good. It's so good. Someone did a base remix of Sea Shanty 2 and it's so good, I love it. What's the easiest mission quest that we could do? I'm not sure. Absolute banger. I'm going to rub my...BRB, I'm going to go rub my... Someone said rune no treasure. What are you going to quest for? You're trolling me, that's not quest. Pirate's treasure? I don't know. I'm sure there's this headless quest. The restless ghost, I think that's it. Yeah, the restless ghost. Let's do the restless ghost because I'm pretty sure. Okay, we need...okay, just teleport back to Lumberge. So open up your magic book and you should have a teleport. It should say Lumberge home teleport. You open up your little magic page. I don't know if you can see it over my hair. Oh, my hair's so big. I can hardly see my inventory. But just teleport back to Lummi. We're going to do it. We're going to draw it in the ground. Who put a cow over here? I don't even know how you did that. Yeah, teleport to Lumberge. Open up your magic spell book and it's the very first one. It should be on cooldown because we've been mucking about. Okay, I'll stand here and I'll wait for my lonely thing to come. Oh, no, I know another one. No. Get away. Get away with your stance. Okay. Yes, your hair is big. It is. I'm covering up my queen. My big A3. Oh, no more silly songs. I love the way you say cow. A cow. A cow. How do you say cow? Who? Oh, you can also say a highland cow. That's true. Wishes to trade with you. Hmm, what do you offer me? What do you offer me? Tomato and cheese. Can I cook that? What do I do with a tomato and cheese sandwich? Yeah. Oh, there's the cow again. Absolutely stunning on them. Good food. I'll eat it the next time I get into a bar fight by accident. Okay, hopefully all the reeflings made it to the teleport. That was your first time teleporting. Who is doing a snowball fight? Okay, let me take us to the next question. Pretty sure it's over here. Sorry, I was bumping my desk. Have you heard that? That cow? A literal woman. I think they heal one. That's all I need in a bar fight. One cheeky bit of health. He he he. Right. Oh, no, it's in here. Sorry, it's in the church. I'm sorry, I'm such a fake gamer. It's inside the church. I apologize. Father Eric. Here, Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. I'm seeking a quest. I'm looking for a quest. I'm looking for a quest. That's lucky. I need someone to do a quest for me. Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended of time. I'm pretty sure you don't have to fight, so we're going to send it, okay? We're going to send it. Accept the graveyard through the south gate and reach the swamp. I'm sure if you told him that, I sent you. He'd be willing to help. My name is Father Eric, by the way. Please come in, yeah. Blackwax. Take her traveling through the swamps. I've heard like a good thing for us. Okay, the stronger reeflings are literally going to have to pick on the animals that pick on the weaker reeflings, okay? Because I'm going to get picked on as well. I need what? Get a ghost speak amulet. Where though? Fuck. Is that from? In the shack up here? We need to go down to the shack. So let's go through the graveyard. Reeflings together strong. Literally. Why is he Father Ted? No, because all like, all prayer men are like ire's. I've forgotten the name of them. The prayer man. I'm not sure if I want to go through the swamp. I think we might need to go around. Unless we've run through the swamp. I don't know. The music's getting different. I'm just a small weak reefling. Yeah, if anyone gets attacked on the way, you're going to have to like help them out and stuff. I'm getting attacked, basically. Because we're too weak for this. Get with me, swamp. What are you doing? Let my swamp. Oh, a priest. Aye, that's the name. It's a priest prayer man. Completely. I've forgotten that word. The music. And this game's set up. It's not highly included either. Adorable youth. I actually had an extended family member that owned one. And it was like the gentlest giant ever. I never got to meet her. It was like a female Highland cow. God, that's the most Scottish thing I could see. I had a family member that owned a Scottish cow. That Highland cow, which is, you know, Scottish. Father Eric sent me to talk to you. I suppose I'd rather talk to you then. What problems have you got himself into this time? It's got a ghost haunting his graveyard. Oh, that silly fool. I leave town for just five months and you already can't manage. Sorry. Well, I can't go back and exercise it. I vowed not to leave this life until I've done a full two years of prayer and meditation. Two years to sit on your own, bro. Right, we need to go talk to the ghost. We now have an amulet. So we're going to, you'll get given an amulet. Make sure you put it on your person. Okay, make sure you do not waste your sprint weaker leaflings because we need to run away, like, from this fight immediately. Two years without internet? I'd be absolutely losing it. I'm sorry. I'd be. I'd just be... Are you squiddin' me right now? Oh, Brian! Hey, Stroney, if I wanted to share a interesting prompt for you to read, but it was too long for Marshmallow. How would you like me to share it with you? I don't think I'll have any other way. Are all the leaflings coming? Leafling, you're so, you're so behind. I'm going to have to wait for them to spawn on the other one. But I don't want us to get attacked by the big routes. I'm not sure. Thank you for the tip, Anon. If it's big? I think Pastebin is a safe website. Right, let's get the heck out here for these rat scouts. Are the frogs at the swamp? Hey, Stroney. Hi, hi. Thanks for joining. Two years of isolation is wild. Literally, like, I'm sorry, but if I was isolated, I'd just straight up day and night. No stop and say, I'm sorry, but I gotta do something to pass the time. Gotta do something to pass the time, so... I do not know how that brings anyone closer to meditation. Could a Pastebin link work? Yeah, I think Pastebin's probably the only thing. Right, I think we need to be ready to run away, so get ready to turn these running boots on, okay? But talk to the restless ghost. Hello, ghost. How are you? Not very good, actually. What's the problem then? Did you just understand what I said? Yeah, no, tell me what the problem is. Woo, this is incredible. I didn't even expect anyone to ever understand me again. Okay, okay, I can understand you. But do you have any idea why you're doomed to be a ghost? Well, to be honest, I'm not sure. I've been told a certain task may need to be completed, so you can rest in peace. I should think it is probably because a warlock has come along and stolen my skull. If you look inside my coffin, it's no there... A wreathling just closed the coffin as soon as he said that. Okay, okay, he's missing his head. We can see he's missing his head. He clearly needs some head. Oh yeah, that would be such great relief. Okay, return the ghost's skull. Where do we need... What? What? We need to go to the wizard's tower? What the hell? I don't remember that. No way. I don't remember. It's actually quite far away. A wreathling was to show me something. What do you want to show me, wreathling? Other player has accepted. Oh, you're giving me fish to cook? Wait, you're giving me this now? Wait, I think you might need to hold on to it. Because if I die in this quest, you need to hold on to this. Okay, hold on to it. Thank you, but you need to hold on to that. Because if I die, I'm going to drop all of that. We'll do a few more quests and then we're going to actually start levelling up cooking like for real, for real, okay? But thank you so much. But do hold on to that because I'm going to end up perishing. Looks in coffin. So no head. Right, are we all here? I think so. When you guys stack, it's really hard to see like if we're all here. Hey, it's the Praise Gocher! Bro, I feel like I'm getting lured. Do you trust me? Do you trust where we're going? It'd be such a shame if you got lured to me. Oh, someone sent me a marshmallow and they're like, I'm going to be mind broken by you. And I'm like... Soon, soon. Wait, is this not where the mage tower is? Oh no, there's enemies ahead that attack us, okay? Everyone get ready to sprint. There's wizards and robes here that are getting ready to attack us. At these trees up here, there's you trees. Please get ready to run if you're a weaker reefling. We're going to get absolutely wrecked. I'll tell you when to run, okay? But it should be coming up. It should be coming up. Wait, isn't there not you logs here? Am I too late? Eh? Isn't there not you logs here and wizards that beat you up here? I guess I must be misremembering. I'm such a fake landscape gamer. That's Viroc. Oh, should be safe. Meet you guys at the mage bank. Take the bridge. Let's go. We're not... We're north of the... Okay. Everyone's following. Sorry, little reefling. You need to come around. Jump up, jump up, and get down. You shall not pass. Excuse me, pardon me. Come through. Pardon me. Come through. Oh my god. Well fought. Right. Be careful, weaker reeflings. We must run away when we do this, okay? Put your gold on in a minute. Hold on, hold on. Get ready for Friday. Search, alter, and run. Run like your little life depends on it. Run on your retentacles. Search the allers. Search the aller, reeflings. Reeflings scare once he spawns in. Run away, reeflings. Run away, run away, run away. Go up the ladder, weaker ones. Go up the ladder, go up the ladder, go up the ladder. As soon as you get the score, you need to go up the ladder. There's so many reeflings. That skeleton's getting absolutely wrecked. We made it, reeflings. We made it, we're safe. We did it. We didn't get wrecked. I'll wait for you outside the mage castello. We did it today, reeflings. We cheated death. It wasn't a match for us. Yeah. Oh my god. So many of us. The scaly didn't know what hit him, literally. It's closing doors. You've been so mean to the reeflings. Not only are you jacking up prices artificially, but you're closing doors. Oh my god. There's so many of us. Oh, he's beating up that wizard. Oh, shadow wizard money gang. They love casting spells. Death by dark wizard is a rinscape right of passage. Honestly though, no troll under the bridge. Yeah. It's normal. Is that all my reeflings? Did we all make it? Hopefully no one perished. Sailing head. What? That's a good girl's trying. You thought. You thought. Ain't that kind of stream? Ain't that kind of stream? I think if I'm feeling better, maybe the ASMR stream, I give permission for you to give it a try. Right. Okay, reeflings. All the way back to the ghost. Oh, unless, wait, follow the rabbit. Follow the rabbit. The rabbit will take us to where we need to go. Honestly, that rabbit outfit, not going to lie. I'm digging it. I'm actually digging that rabbit. Like, I mean, you can see the hips definition. You can see the yiddies. It's all looking pretty good. And then headless refilling. You're at my render distance. Whoever's back there had this refilling. Look at the size of them grippers. Oh, we're up. What is that? Someone's got like a thing on their back. I honestly didn't know how many cosmetics there was in the game. If you get us beaten up by baddies, because you've taken this path. Okay, I think we're safe. Reefling just hovering in the background. Hey, it's constantly coming in and out of render distance. Okay, hydration check. I hope this taxi is better than the last. Oh, wow. Oh, no. Rad attack. Walking us to the Edgeville dungeon. Wait, there is a place called Edgeville. Oh my gosh, that's where we should make the home. Oh, I was going to play hide and seek. And if I touch you, then you're out. Right, where do we need to go? Oh, we need to go to the graveyard, guys. Yeah, there's literally a place called Edgeville in this game. There's a plugin for hide and seek. Is there actually? That's so smart. Maybe next stream I'll get the plugin and we'll see how it works. I don't know. Hide and seek. I'd rather lose. But every time I find you, all you hear is plop, plop, plop. And then move on to the next refund. Plop, plop, plop. It's over. Okay. We need to put the hedge on the coffin. And all is good. We're going to use the skull on the coffin. Use it on the coffin. It's not a... Oh, cut scene. Release. Thank you, stranger. Yeah. Oh, he's away. Oh, he's in the water. Oh, he's had enough. He's in the water. Whoa, we got one cave prayer for that. That was actually pretty big. Right, we've got four quest points now. Jeez, we've got nine prayers. What? And I'm level four combat currently. I didn't fight anything, though. Hide and plop. Yes, hide and plop. I want to find hide and plop. Good. Release. Oh, that's a lot. Everyone's leveling up. Rep sleeping viewers. Yeah, sorry. Hopefully no one actually uses this to sleep, too. I wonder if there's also a kumbor. Right, what's the easiest quest next? Or are we actually going to have to level up? I think we might have to get stronger because everything's like... Maybe Goblin Village? If we buy everything in advance for that Goblin quest, I forgot the name of it. Romeo and Juliet is good. Should we try Romeo and Juliet? Romeo and Juliet. Also an amulet that's useful for the future, right? Stronghold of security time? I've never done that one. Romeo and Juliet is no needed stats. Okay, we're going to do that one then. I can start this quest by talking to Romeo and Varrock Square. Who the heck? Oh, that's a big walk. Not going to lie. That's like really far away. Not going to lie. Okay, we cross the bridge, and then we just keep going all the way up to Varrock. I've already lost where Romeo is. Oh, he's literally in the square of Varrock. Well, we don't have teleport stone, so we're going to have to do it the old fashioned way. I heard it drops the goal in the amulet. I don't know what that is. Follow, someone says follow. Just... Oh, oh, taxi! Okay, follow the guy with the magma cape. Wait, make sure we get out of the graveyard first because we might actually get stuck on the gravestones. Yeah, you'll get... Careful, you'll get stuck on the gravestones. Okay, if you're going to tax sales, can I make a cup of tea? Am I allowed to make a cup of tea? That little voice is getting sore. This is a magma cape, winky. It is! Isn't that a magma cape? Whoa, what is that? Wait, you got a special accolade? Is that a special accolade to this thing? Oh, it's a fire cape. I mean, it looks like magma lava, so whoever named it is wrong. We... We must go directly into the dark mages. Oh, wait, I can't make a cup of tea because I'm going to get hurt by the mages. For the weaker reeflings, we're about to pass some wizards outside of a rock that will attack us. We need to be ready to run. Go west near the farm. Oh, he says he's going to go around. I think we have enough people to kill the dark wizards. Oh, can I go quickly make a cup of tea, then? Watching strongy stream? Whenever I read the last thingy, you know the love heart? You can put a love heart on stream. Tap that love heart thing. It's in the way if I read the most bottom thing. It says, watching strongy stream is the type of accolade. Yeah, if you tap that heart, I can see when you tap it, but it blocks the last message. I'll be doing nothing but laughing if anyone dies. Oh, we'll also be at the bank, so is that reefling still there to trade the fish? Plenty more fish. I can only see it on mobile. Yeah, I can see someone make a flush face smiley reaction. It's in the way for everyone. Okay, right. I was going to say, because it's in the way. Whenever I read the most bottom message, it's in the way. That cape requires you to kill a level 700 monster. Unless you guys can carry me through that monster, I don't think we can do that. I've never done it before. Yeah, I had to nuke the heart with an edlocker. I think you can toggle it away. Yeah, I have to scroll around it. It's a solo fight? Well, I'm never getting that. I am here with the fish. Okay, we will be going next to the bank, so we should be okay. I think. Is there any? Hopefully, there's not too many. Oh, yeah. Good idea to go to the bushes first. Oh, no, these reeflings. Oh, no, don't get stuck on the wall, reefling. These are reeflings. Oh, no, I don't know if that's everything. I might just be someone. There's three dots at the top of chat. No, no, I think it's okay. I think it's there. Fire cape would be fun. Oh, no, I don't even know how to do that. I don't even know how prayer pots work in, like, strength potions and all of that work, and it's, like, all temporary, but they're, like, a thousand, and it's so expensive. Watch out now. All right, weaker reeflings. Get ready. Get ready, weaker reeflings. Stronger reeflings. Beat them up. Show those wizards. We mean freaking... We mean business. Beat them up, stronger reeflings. We'll be... The weaker reeflings are going to stick together. This is the best we can do under the circumstances. Cut off, Boudin. Run into the circle reefling. No, do not go in that circle. These wizards are stinky. They're no good, guys. He's telling you fevers. He's telling you the Fibonacci sequence, because those are fevers. Okay, I think the reeflings, like, literally eradicate all the wizards for us in a way. Thank you. They're all dead. Literally just absolutely eradicated them. I think the funniest thing ever. Wow. How can I tell? Whoa, how many quests is there? I don't know if we can do all the quests in just a little while. Right, we're looking for R for Romeo. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Okay. We're here. Right, who's Romeo? Oh, Romeo's inside the shop. Inside the shop with the green windows. Inside the shop is where Romeo is. He thought he could hide from us. Right, talk to Romeo. Romeo. What? What is to become of me and my darling Juliet? I cannot find her anywhere. Have you seen her? Yes, I have seen her, actually. At least, I think it was her. Blonde, a bit stressed. Golly, yes, yes. You make a sense of very interesting. And I'll bet she's a bit of a fox around. Well, I guess she could be considered attractive. I'll bet she is. Woo-hoo. Sorry, all that jubilation has made me forget what we were talking about. You were asking me about Juliet. You seem to know her. Oh, yes, Juliet. That fox. Could you tell her that she is the love of my long? What? She is the love of my long? Rinse, jagged. She's the love of my long and that I love to be with her. What? What? Surely you mean she is the love of your life and that you long to be with her? Oh, yes, what you said. Tell her that, it sounds much better. Oh, you're so good at this. Start the Romeo and Juliet quest. Yeah, okay, I'll let her know. Oh, great, and tell her that I want to kiss her a give. You mean you want to give her a kiss? Oh, you are good, you are good. I see I've picked a true professional. Is he drunk? Okay, thanks. Yay! Okay, has everyone got the quest? We now need to... Actually, we're going to very quickly go to the bank and I'm going to young call the fish from your juicy, juicy donations to me. Okay. Oh, wait, sorry, sorry, wait, wait, wait. Pause, pause. I'm in the square, I'm in the square. Sorry, I didn't mean to run away so quickly. We're going to very quickly go to the Grand Exchange because I'm going to empty my inventory and if you want to give me anything, you can, okay? But I'll... Uh, no, don't give me a bond. I've already bought premium, thank you so much. Don't give me a bond though, I bought premium. Right, Reflings, if you want to follow me, we're going to go to the Grand Exchange. So if you want to give me anything, you can. Get your scam messages ready. Oh no, I need to mute public chat whilst we're here. I might need to mute public chat. I don't know how bad the bots are going to be. I have no idea how bad the bots are going to be. I might have to mute public chat until we go away. Buying girlfriend through... Oh, there's like the bots aren't talking. Okay, nothing's happening. Right, I'm going to put... I'm literally... Oh no, no, I don't want to sell them. I'm just literally going to shove everything in the bank. Uh, I think I'll just drop the clue scroll. Ah, you know what? I'll just put it in the bank. It doesn't make a difference. Put all my coins in. I've got an antique lamp. I don't know what that does. Oh, I can't put it away. Uh, I'll rub the antique lamp. Oh! Um, into kicking please. Hey, 300 XP in kicking. Yay! Okay, I'm level 7. Cooking now feels good, man. Stand over here. If you want to trade me, you're more than welcome to. I'm literally starting a farm for, uh... How do I accept, accept? Okay, there we go. Sorry, sorry, I'm dumb. Oh my gosh, that's a lot of fish. Oh, a 10 million? Are you crazy? Isn't that a lot of money? Are you sure? That's a lot of money. Oh wait, did I just accept you as a friend by accident? Whoops. 10 million reeflings. Is this account going to get shot down? Because, like, Jagex are going to be like, you're clearly, like, paying for these? I got lobster! I'm cake! Yes! Thank you for the lobster! Oopsie. The weapon is 1.2 billion? That's crazy. Sorry, I think I accidentally added a frame. 10 million? Isn't that not, like, a... How much, how much ink? How much ink? 1,000 crusty socks? Why did Jagex make that item? They knew exactly what they were doing. Doubling money! This shmuck just made 10 million. Doubling money, doubling money. That's ridiculous. On the contrary, we play here. Oh, it's a ring! Oh, can I wear it? Am I allowed to put it on? It's a diamond reefling! Oh, my God. Wait, wait. Can I see it on my finger if I put it on? No, I didn't change my persons. I'm married to the reeflings. He he he he he. Okay, what do we do on the wedding then? What's the honeymoon? I want to know about the honeymoon. Fishies! Oh, we are going to be, like, exploding. Oh, my God, that's so much. We are going to be exploding once we cook all these. Thank you, reeflings. Oh, my gosh. Okay, I'm going to put it all in the bank, and then we get to come back. Come back. There's not one single bot here. That's pretty thingy. Okay, we are doing Romeo and Juliet. Do we need to do anything? We actually don't need any items at all. Wow. Oh, sorry. Sorry, there's a few more that wish to trade. My apologies. My apologies. Fishies! Look at all the fishies. You can bank note these, by the way. But thank you for the fishies. We're getting so much fish. Yes, thank you. Okay, how do I accept this? Oh, I'm getting grapes. Hey, yo, you want to grape me? Hold on a minute. Oh, no, sorry. The cut of our berries. My apologies. My apologies. It's a wedding gift. Who did I not accept the trade from? Is it you? Did I accept the trade from you? God, great. Wait, does Johnny come in tax fraud and runescape? Honestly? Oopsie, sorry. Oh, wait, hold on. I accidentally added a reefling. I apologize. Sorry. It's just because it was show. What's the dress going to look like? Someone called Sweaty Socks. Are you role-playing as my Sweaty Socks? I actually have socks on. Oh, it's a necklace. It's so pretty. Oh, they get to put it on. Amulet of power. Oh, check me out. Oh, look at that little thing. This puppet that you get to hurry. When we celebrate in the wedding on my alternative Twitter. Eat cuttlefish. Whatever, you name yourself like that. Unless you mean the other way. What, you got to show me what you've got? Eat cuttlefish. You know what? Are you just going to... Hi, Johnny, sounding beautiful as ever. Are you declined it? Right, I will put this away in the bank. And then we will finish Gnotic and Elf and Gnotic and Oblin. Wait, why is that not doing all... There we go. Oh, that's all I needed to do. Speaking of alt-Twitters. What was your reaction to them blown up? So, Mercy stumbled upon the algorithm. And then Sheebie did it. But I did mine too late, Rip. But, I mean, the video did really well. It got like a hundred and... A thousand likes on it. And you're really good. Wait, are you trying again? Did you get stage fright? Or is that the other one? Ah, okay, okay, okay. Right, Gnome, Gnotic and Elf and Gnotic and Oblin. We need to Gnotic and Elf to over to Gnor. To Faldor, I think. I think she's somewhere here. I don't know where she is. Talk to Romeo, I did. Did I not accept? Talk to Romeo, I did. Talk to Juliet in the house west of Viroc. Oh wait, they're both in Viroc? Why did I think she was in Faldor? And where is Gnotic and Oblin? I'm analising. I'm analising. Oh! Eh? She's here? Why would you be in there? Okay. Alright, let's go to the front of the Grand Exchange for my little refillings, front of the Grand Exchange, front centre. After this quest, I am going to... Faldor? I hardly even know her. Thank you, thank you. I came up with that myself, thank you. Refillings, I'm at the front of the Grand Exchange. You can find me over here. So we're making a clan. Can you make a clan? Like, can anyone make a clan? That video was amazing. All per eco fish just wanted to feel included in it. It got none to thingy. A luring clan, he even knows. Okay, is this all my refillings? We're at the front? Okay, this looks like great. Ready? Atten! Up! Two, three, four. Up! Two, three, four. How do I get in this house? It looks like I get in this door here. Unless there's another door. No, there's a door here. Okay, we just used this door. Literally right over there. Hut! Two, three, four. Hit! Two, three, four. Mine is too bad joke, literally. Just going down ten aura, sorry. Okay, open the door. Hello, we would like to come inside your house. Don't mind us, we're just... How have I come the hardest way to get around this house? There's no way! I literally picked the most awkward door. I'm so sorry! We literally have trailed through the entire house, but the one door. Stop pranking each other with the door! You're pranking me with the door! Why is there a fisherman? It's a true draw party! Get your truck, get your truck, get your truck. We're going to need it. We're going to need all the XP. I got three, four, five, six. I don't know how I managed to do the worst. Right, go up the stairs. Up the stairs. It smells fishy in here. It does. Right, where's Juliet? Oh, her room's all pink. Oh my God, you're such a girl. How do we know Juliet's a girl? Hmm, it's a mystery. Hi Juliet. Juliet, I've come from Romeo. He begs me to tell you that he cares still. Oh how my heart soars for hearing this news. Please take this message to him with great haste. Well, I hope it's good news. He was quite upset when I left him. He's quite often upset at the poor sensitive soul, but I don't think he's going to take this news very well. However, all is not lost. Everything is explained in the letter. Would you be so kind to deliver it to him, please? Certainly, I'll do so straight away. Many thanks. Oh, I'm so very grateful. You may be our only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Okay, as everyone spoke to Juliet, Romeo and Juliet, we're just literally passing sextant messages, honestly. What's going on here? If you have spoken to Juliet, we can go back doing the stairs, and we're going to go back to Romeo. Oh, Romeo, where are for thou art Romeo? Oi, who closed that door? I literally just smacked my face. My, I freaking, you closed that door, and now I'm tracking outside backwards. Stop it. Don't, don't close the door. You made me whack my face into it. Stop it. Let me out of this house. It keeps trying to make me go. Right, I'm out. I'm out. Okay, we're safe. We're safe. You don't want to go through the five doors instead, honestly. Forget doing agility training. It's hard enough to get out of a door that someone else is closing. What? How did that pop up? I didn't even accept. Okay, our all reflings here. We're going to go back to Romeo. He's this way. Hardest boss in the game, pathing. Yeah. Are we refling back there? Dear Mario, please come to the castle. Oh, did I tell you I really like this meme? Dear Mario, please don't come to the castle. I've baked a cake. It's absolutely dark shit. I love that meme so much. Okay, we go talk to Romeo back in the green shop. Why is that green? Oh, cloth right. Which one did that? Stop. Stop it. Stop. Right, I'm in. Who did that? Was that you? Was that you? You're the one who's right behind the door. I love Mummy. Am I accusing you live? Was that you? I don't know who did that. I don't know who did that. Talk to Romeo. Romeo, great news. I've been in touch with Big Juliet. She's written a message for you. You hand over the message. Oh, a message. A message. I've never had a message before. Really? No, no, no. Not one. Well, except for the occasional court summon. But the really, really nice message. Not like this one. I'm sure this message will be lovely. Yes, yes. Where are you? Well, are you going to open it or not? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Yes, of course. Affection. She thinks I'm deceased. Oh, affliction. Oh, I can't read. Sorry. I'm not going to get my glasses on. Sorry. It says affliction. Affection. Oh, wait. No, I got it right. Affection. Oh, yes. Still hold affection for me. I still feel great affection for you. Unfortunately, my father opposes our marriage. Oh, dear. That doesn't sound too good at all. I want great affection for you. Father opposes our marriage. And well, we'll kill you if he sees you again. I'm going to be honest. It's not getting any better, me. Our only hope is that the father Lawrence, a long time confidant, can help us in some way. Romeo folds the message away. Well, that's it then. We haven't got a chance. What about Father Lawrence? Our love is over the great romance that'll life of my love. Or you could speak to Father Lawrence. Oh, my aching, breaking heart. Oh, how useless the situation is now. I've got no one to turn to. Father Lawrence. Father Lawrence. Oh, yes, Father Lawrence. He's a long time confidant. He might have a solution. Yes, yes. You have to go and talk to Father Lawrence for once and ask him if he's got any suggestion for a predicament. Where can I feign Father Lawrence? Lawrence, Father Lawrence. Oh, you know, he's not my real father, don't you? I think I suspected that he wasn't. Did he get hit on the head? Well, anyway, he tells his songs, luring bare moans and keep these here. What? I can't even read that. Yeah, okay, thanks. Okay, thanks. Yeah, thanks mate. Nice try on the English, but even I can't read that. Where the heck are we going? Somewhere over here. He's just a, and then dot, dot, dot. I don't know what you typed, Reefling. Are you trying to say he's one of us? For that word, he's one of us. No one slammed the door. I slammed my piece. Okay, Reeflings, we're going a little to the left outside that shop. Any Reeflings left behind? There's one Reefling. Yay. I don't think these are all NPCs. I love Reefling there. I didn't close the door, but I'm ready to accept any punishment you do with it. Captain Jack Thornbare. Okay, let's go. We are just following the path. I see the blue marker because of rune light, so we're just following that. But, oh no! Oh no, I'm going to get you strapped on the fence. I'm sorry. I was a bit, I was a bit preemptive. Okay, okay, that was lucky. Easy, take it easy, easy. Let's not get any Reeflings caught on a fence. Come on. We can do it. I have no idea how. Oh, here's the church. Right, we're going to go to the steps over here. Rare correct path, I think, honestly. Going to Wildy Ditch. Should we start attacking each other? Should we do fisty cuffs? Should we do fisty cuffs in Wildy and just start beating each other up until there's a crowned Reefling at the end? And then I give you a rose as a favour because you're the knight that stood against all Reeflings. And... And lutes are domain, like the way for you. Oh, I was in the middle of a ceremony. But Romeo sent me. But I'm busy delivering in a ceremony to my congregation. Ah, yes. It certainly seems like you have a captive audience. Okay, okay, what do you want? So I can get rid of you and continue with my ceremony. Romeo sent me? He says you've been able to help? Ah, Romeo, yes. A fine land, but he's a wee bit confused. Very confused. Anyway, Romeo wishes to be married to Julia. She must be rescued from her father's control. I agree, and I think I have an idea. A potion to make her dad... Oh, to appear passed away. Dead! Sounds a bit creepy to me, but please continue. The potion will only make Julia yet appear dead. Then she will be taken to the crypt. Crypt! Again, we're getting a bit creepy, mate. You must have some strange hobbies. That's what the berries someone gave me. Apart from... Did that refling want me to be asleep? Or did you want to be asleep? Okay, reflings! Once you have... Why does someone have a... Someone has a prayer on? Don't leave it on. You've got a prayer on. You're going to run out of prayer. Also, someone get fond of the potion! That's terrible. Guys, you're putting your prayer on. You're going to run out of prayer. Literally, I only have nine prayer points. Right, everyone outside the church. Con- Mass is over. Congrats on finishing Mass. You just have a lot of fun. Where are we going? Oh, that's cool. Oh, you can't see because of my hair. All right, you can kind of see it. See how the bar is like... Oh, you're getting close to being finished. That's new. I don't remember that. Where are we heading? Where are we heading? Whoa! Where am I? No? Can I please go back to the surface? Thank you. Where do we need to go? I'm looking... Oh, there is... Still in the same town. Thank goodness. Okay. I'll just follow the HUD for the most part. Oh, you wished to trade with me. I will accept your trade. What do you offer me? What do you offer me? Oh! You've rejected! How dare you! Oh, no. I had to do with a friend. Sorry. I keep freaking adding people as a friend by accident. Oh, wait. Hold on. I need to remove you. I'm dying. Delete. Rip. One tick. Player. Flick. One tick flicking on Romeo and Juliet Quest. True gamers here, honestly. I wish I understood the tick mechanic. I've heard it explained so many times to me. I don't get it. I don't get it. I'm practicing. Literally. Oh, there's like little birds making noises in the game. Is this the actual priestess... Crickets, please. What? You want me to just play? I'll just play crickets right now, even though you asked for it like five minutes ago. Oh, it's this shop. Okay. What are we doing over here? I thought it was only in the day that I remember Scotland. I'm like, I can be out until like 9. It's summer. When it's summer in Scotland, the sun doesn't go away until like 9. It's pretty bright. Oh, no. I'm closing the door. Okay. I thought I was closing the door, but I'm not. Okay. Let's talk. I am apocrity. I broke potions. Do you need anything? Yes. I do need something very specific about Romeo and Juliet. Wait. Wasn't there a movie called Romeo and Juliet? And it was about nose. What do these berries look like? Wait. We need berries. Oh, no. Someone gave me berries. Okay. I guess we will get the berries. Um, to the Grand Exchange Reeflings, we will go obtain some berries. Oh, I can't get out because someone closed the door. I clicked on the map to get out. Someone's closing the door. I can't get out of that room. I'm not stuck in there. Yeah. My hand hurts after a few minutes of it. Oh, you can only last a few minutes now? One handed? Right. Let's go get some berries. Secret berries. I thought it said I didn't need anything. It said recommended items. None. It says bring. You can pick some from the bushes. Oh, we're to pick them from the bushes. I'm sorry. I apologize. Where's the bushes? Bring. Talk. I've just read it. Bring. Nope. I just read where I can pick the bushes. You can pick some bushes southeast of Iraq. Wait. Where am I supposed to go then? What's southeast? Southeast? Like over here? Feels like I can get stabbed in these back alleys. You can pick my dingo, but... Send! We're trying to find a freaking bush. Yeah, done. Yeah, done. I didn't tell you my short caller arrived for our streaming app. Where are the berries? Pass the dark wizard. Okay. Strong reeflings, please go ahead and beat the absolute crap out of those dark wizards. For weaker reeflings, get ready. Prepare thyself. Where are these berries? I'm looking. Oh my god, the reeflings are just absolutely going to town on them. All the magic noises. Oh! Yes! The bushes are ahead. Fragile and weak, please handle me with care. Trying to find strongies bushes then. Right. I'm going to say something. I'm going to say something controversial. I was going to make a here ASMR, like here sounds, but it was rather, rather different. Okay. Right. I've got berries. Everyone, everyone collect your berries off the bushes. Has everyone got a berry? It looks like they're infinite spawn bushes actually, so. Wait, did bots run these berries? Wait, it's cost 400 GP for these berries? Have we just stumbled on a money maker? Here ASMR, not controversial. How would that even work? I would place the microphone at hips level. I've been here for two seconds and you're already getting controversial. I can't. You show up in it. Right. I think everyone's got it. Yeah. These berries are bought and free to play world smothers with your hair. Next winning strat in GG. Okay. Let's go past the wizards again. Stronger leaflings. You know the drill. Has everyone got a berry? 400 GP. Oh my God. That's huge. Interest on the 10 million GP. True. True. 10 million GP investment. Beat them up. Beat them up. Show them who's boss. Oh, that red bead is worth so much money. Oh, that refling got it. Oh, no. Take this bead. I got it. I got it. Wow. Wizard hats are 1,000 money. Why is it so much money? We should be killing these wizards over and over again. Okay. I'm going to get out of here before we're getting trouble. I don't want the wizards to spawn and start getting us. Stronger leaf, we're doing this one. Can we have a reward that lets us see the stream stingers? Stop. I've literally not even put them on. I just realized I've not even shown you what my stream stingers look like. That's terrible. That's terrible. Literally like, what did reflings look like? And I'm like, what do you mean? I've already shown you what reflings look like in the artwork. We've got stingers either. And I don't even use my loading screen. And I spent like 600 US dollars on it. I'm like, genuinely such a bad vtuber. But I just want to jump in the game. Who did that? Who did that? Who did that? I managed to somehow get past. Alright, Romeo and Juliet. Well done. You have the berries. I do. Okay. Oh, he's apocratizing. He's apocratizing all over the place. I'm going to smack the plan. Bring the potion to Juliet. Okay. I'm going to stand outside and wait for everyone to get out. Because you already know what's going to happen. And you're always going to freaking smack everyone's face. Strongest seat is a moneymaker. Who said that? Oh. Okay, wait until the other reflings are ready. I'm mousin' all over the refling. I'm mousin' all over you. Are you like that? Oh, I got that. Mousin' all over me. I'm just mousin' all over you. Watch out for Viralt Guards. No, Virat. Doubt these potions are illegal. I haven't made any money though. Drink the potion for a funny thing. Oh, I don't want to drink it. I'd have to go get another thing again. Does it make you pass out? Viralt Guards don't get paid enough to care about that. Honestly, $1 million donation reward. Use stream startin' screen once for 10 seconds. Bravo, honestly. It's been $600, $800-ish. Okay, is that one more refling? Oh, we're all level six now or something? Whoa, that's a lot of refling. Well, no, refling. Or are you not done the quest properly? Or is this... You've got a chef's hat on, which makes me think you're a refler. What are the odds that someone just happens to be doing the quest at the same time? When are we going to winter town? I've literally never done any event in RuneScape because I'm just so bad at it and I don't understand. I know that because I had to hunt it down to get a refler shop for the fan art. Oh, watch it mostly shine. I didn't even know stingers were a thing. So everyone got a logo stinger and everyone got an artwork stinger. I need a moment of time. Oh, someone wants to trade. Except your trade. What do you offer me? Ah! Okay. I'll accept. I did say I wanted your ink, okay? I got you. Yeah. Right, we're going to hand over the potion to Julia. Winter tot is where the yarrow... Literally, that's why I'm like winter fell in Skyrim. That's where the yarrow live. Right, we're going to open the door for everyone. Yarrow ballroom. These here. Oh, I'm going to close the door back. Okay, let's get inside the house, please. Get inside the house. Get up the stairs. Anyway, if I catch any refling closing doors... Something bad's going to happen. I don't know. I'm not decided on the punishment yet. Your stream starting soon is very beautiful. Yes, but it's very... As well. Oh, sorry. I have a Kandava potion here. Suggested by Father Lawrence, if you... Oh, wait, that's me. Excuse me, sorry, I don't know where that voice came from. Have a Kandava potion here. Suggested by Father Lawrence. If you drink it, it will make you appear dead. Yes? And when you appear dead, you're still in lifeless corpse will be removed from the crypt. Oh, a cold, dark, creepy crypt. Sounds just peachy. Then Romeo can steal... And... Let's just steal into the crypt and rescue you just as you wake up. And this is a great idea for getting me out of here. To be fair, I can't take all the credit. In fact, it was all Father Lawrence's suggestion. Okay, if this is the best we can do, then hand over that potion. You pass the suspicion potion to Juliet. Wonderful. Wonderful, I just thought Romeo could remember to get me from the crypt. Why do I feel like we're about to bust her out of the crypt? Please go to Romeo and make sure you understand the lie of his... His gormless, love-lorn, soppy ways. He can be a bit dense sometimes and I don't want to wake... And I want to wake up in the crypt on my own. Yeah, we're definitely picking up the crypt. Here it is. Oh, he... Here's Philippine, my cousin, she's in... She's in on the plot too. She's going to make it seem like it's more convincing. Yes, I'm quick. Ah. What's a British boy? He's quick, British, quick. Nick-a-car. Yes, I'm quite an actress. Good luck, dear cousin. Right, bottoms up. Oh, she's Paris. Oh, no. Juliet has died. You may be more believable if you're not smiling when you see it. Oh, yeah. You might be right. Oh, no, no, no. Let's try that again. Try that again. Oh, no. Juliet's dead. I can't do, like, three different accents at one time. Perhaps a bit louder, like, you're upset, you know, that your cousin just died. Right, yeah, okay. Nick-a-car. Okay, I think I'm getting the motivation now. Okay, let's just try this again. Oh, no. Juliet's dead. Oh, no. Oh, no. Juliet, my poor dead cousin. Oh, this was not a lot of screaming. Oh, you cunt, she's dead. Oh, poor Juliet. I made preparations for her body to be blessed with the crypt. This is terrible. I don't know where that came from. Right, okay. Where do we go next? Bring... Talk to Romeo and Varric Square to finish the quest. All right. That man was Cornel Sanders. How am I getting door blocked? How have they not figured out this freaking door block, honestly? Stop! Right, I just went through that door. That's how strong I am. I just went through that door. Okay. Let's go to Romeo. Where everyone... Right, I'll wait outside. Father noticed that a random person handed her a potion and she perished, literally. Oh, no. Juliet. You're dead. No. I say no. Follow the cute face. Any cute fishers? Any cute fishermen coming to hook her? Yee. Quite the hooker. Hey. Yeah. Oh. Yo-ho. I assume everyone got out. Yeah, the door's been left open. That's how I know all the reeflings are available. Oh, there's two doors to this place. Okay, we'll go in this room. Oh, I now understand people are in their angular gear. I saw that. Who's that shadowed guy? I saw that. You literally are making us walk all the way around because you closed that fecking door. I saw that. I literally saw that in 4K. It's you. It's the freaking shadow one. Who's your name? Identify yourself. Bye. More like slamming to a door. Romeo, it's all set. Juliet has dropped the potion. Ah, great. The potion. Great. What potion would that be then? The kind of a potion. You know, the one which will make her appear dead. She's in the crepe. Pop along and clean your true love. But I'm scared. Will you come with me? Yeah, I knew we were going to come with you. Oh, come on. I just saw the entrance when I visited there last. Stranny, you have hooked me. What voice did I give him? Oh, this is pretty scary. I would be quiet. Oh, he's got flowers. Oh my god, cut scene. Look, we're here. Look, Juliet's over there. Oh, there she is. I don't remember doing this quest, honestly. I think I'll confuse it with Goblin Mail one. Go over to her and I'll go wait over here. Okay, then. Yeah, just go. She's fine. Hey, Juliet. Juliet. Oh, dear. You seem to be dead. What voice did I give her? Oh, Romeo. I'm Philippa. Oh, wow. You're a fox. It's a shame about Juliet, but perhaps we can meet up later. Who's Juliet? Wait, what? That's it? What? What? Hello? I didn't wait, so she's actually dead. Did we actually kill her? Oh, no. That's really sad. I actually feel really bad. I don't remember that. Father Lawrence messed it all up. We just poisoned an innocent woman. Wait, we're go check. Wait, we'll go to her house to see if she's there because what? That was a method. Right, we're going back to the house because what? Juliet in shambles, literally. She's selling her stonks. That was crazy. Right, the door's still open. Surely. Surely there will be no shenanigans at this door. She's fine. Is she actually? Let's get inside. Let's inside. Inside. There we go. You got there in the end. You just need a little guidance. I suppose you're quite pleased with yourself now. Wait, why? Juliet? She's literally getting ran through about yourself. What did she say? I sat in that cold crib for ages waiting on Romeo. That useless fool never showed up. And all I got was indigestion. I'm done with men like him. Now go away before I call my father. Oh, can I play piano? Oh, I wish you could play piano. That'd be kind of cool though. That's so bad. Wait, why can't I go through that door? That's actually really sad. I feel kind of bad though. Sorry, Juliet. We didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Stop! I'm getting locked in again. Actually getting soft locked in my video game. Okay, I am going to make a cup of tea and call a pee break. And then we're... Are we got enough level, like enough skill level now that anyone can like trade? Is nine quest points enough? I think we were going to do some quick fissure. Fissure on. Pee break, finally. Let's just name a preview. All of yous have been needing a pee for ages. A wee break. A piddle break, if you will. Oh my god. Yeah, what do you want to give me? Oh, a beer and a kebab. Are you asking for a drunk stream soon? Because don't think I won't do that. Don't think I won't give the people what they want. Thank you very much. Okay. Oh wait, is that going to log me out and then you can all see what my freaking email is? I will turn... I will hide the game off a screen. But I might have to log back in again. No, let's game audio. Hold on. Game chat, donations. In game? No. Right. I'm going to do that just in case because I don't know if it's going to show. You can set it to 25 minutes. Oh, I've not set it. Okay. Give me like three minutes. I'm going to pee. I'm going to make a cup of tea. I do recommend you get up, stretch your legs, get some water and then we are going to do actual cooking. We're going to do actual cooking now, I think. Because we've hit the quest point thing. I don't know. But okay. Give me... Let me cook for like three minutes and by cook, I mean let me boil a freaking a kettle. Okay. Right. I will be a moment. Okay. Three minutes. Go for a go for a tinkle-winkle. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

chicken and all that trout is 15 which is a big start upgrade so I guess we're doing this until 15 and we're going fishing elsewhere but as we level up we get closer and closer oh my god level four fishing not to brag or anything but level four all of us I'm pretty close level fishing wait what are you doing a command he's tapping a command well got run you catch the shrimp and burn them I'll burn them thanks for hanging see when you come back I just I don't know I've not decided if it's an endurance right now we're just memeing and dreaming and streaming and fishing and then we're fishing and we're cooking and we're cooking and we're fishing my mind not working you just gotta trust me for real for real don't worry I do this all the time don't worry did you see it what what did I see the toenail wait what did I miss was there something on stream I don't see it I see you guys we're all just hanging out sorry I've got gains to get bye bye I don't think I was a roofland I was someone that was interested in what we're doing see how you feel like four is going from there she literally at the start was no this will not be an endurance human after a few hours she doesn't know anymore it's hard just the bots hanging out doing a lot of bot things he wants to talk about his cars extended warranty I literally I do not want to talk to you leave me alone old man he's getting harassed by an NPC shadow wizard and when you get how how purple are those anchovies are shrimpies oh wait anchovies and shrimp are different hmm just tip some money for another four hours I'm like a receipt a reciprocal a reciprocal Danny you put Danny put text behind my screen okay there text doesn't go over me anymore oh my god leveling up we're getting them gains I did not realize how slow fishing was to get my goodness she doesn't want to leave us honestly I like after the so I can apply for monetization I'm going to apply after the stream and see what happens I don't know how long it's going to take but um tomorrow's ASMR so that's short and then the taste test and stream is short as well however it might work out better because if I get monetized then I'm doing my pop-up monetization stream surprise thing um I know I'm fishing but there's no fishy I wish you good luck on the month yeah basically YouTube just reviews the account and goes yeah good to go oh man my bank is locked can you hit me up again in three days I don't know what that means back to fishing we're just fishing uh but yes um we're just going to level up as much as we can do right now um any ringfoot adventure streams yeah 100% I absolutely adore love ring uh ringfoot adventure and it was really fun as long as it's not dangerous for my car but I'm pretty sure I got pretty high last time do you have an idea of how many more watch hours you need oh I made watchers the problem was YouTube wasn't updating our stats for one week like the stats are now behind one week like it doesn't make sense um so only now I can apply even though after debut we had watch time like it's just a bit it's a bit silly but um we're submitting we also think now that we have one confirmed like week of stats the culling stops here so you might be unsubscribed if you're watching in right now I don't know but don't be afraid to like and subscribe to the stream helps out you know that jazz but um we think the culling has stopped so a few ASMR group collabs and all that are gonna come out shortly after monetization because the girls some dummy used my email to make an account and one of the passwords I use that's just like as great names ring fit my blood please don't push yourself too hard like that one time I don't I just really enjoyed it but I can't do like subscribe and send your bank card details hell yeah um just thumbs up right now thank you I don't know why but haven't been subbed on once um maybe it's because I got YouTube premium I don't know what caused it because I did get marshmallows that are like no I like I straight up gotten subbed by like three of the girls or did this or whatever I don't know if it's also related to if you don't watch the girls like shorts or if you don't watch any content but subscribe and then peace out then YouTube don't like that and see it as bot activity rather than someone subscribing and being like I'll come back later and watch this like not everyone watches YouTube shorts um which reminds me I should have sent two shorts to Emmy to review because the editor had finished those shorts I'm going to do that after stream and solve by watching everyone literally if you put if you watch their shorts or puts like some minutes and a watch time into them then I think YouTube doesn't um take you I got unsubbed from some other VTubers pre-davio but not from any of the girls good good that's what I like to hear so me subscribing just to support is pointless oh no like actual YouTube subscribe is not pointless what happened was the accounts were getting called because they were new and for bot protection we were getting wrecked but we think now because there's one week of confirmed stats it's over like I don't think we got called at all recently like today or when I was asleep so yeah so I think it's only going up from here now thankfully I like check the stats of everyone's accounts and we should have been at 5k right now but it's okay we'll we'll work back up towards it um yes it's weird I know it's bot protection I had never experienced it before and me oh my it was aggressive on us very aggressive but I do think it's I genuinely do believe it's over especially once the girls get monetized I don't think you experience it as a monetized channel because that just seems a bit odd because they know if you're being watched by bots or not so oh my god my mind's are cracking okay I'm gonna slip my slip I'm gonna sip my tea please don't do anything to the slit okay delicious but yes I have a very fun collapse coming out soon TM I can't wait YouTube stopped in oh literally it's such a shame I felt so bad for the girls because we were like in the discord like oh my god we're at 3000 subscribers oh my god oh my god like getting ready to make but like all of us held back from doing a celebration post because it just wasn't happening and it was such a shame I do have a special like congrats on 5k for everyone posting a 10k and then I don't know what's happening after that if I should order more artwork or not the 10k artwork is absolutely gorgeous so I can't wait for everyone to react to it but I can't I can't let anyone know what it is I don't want to ruin the surprise level 10 cooking we did it we did it are you squidding me right now Brian can't wait my wallet is ready pachinga thank you very much for the tip again you can't wait for what the 10k it's already it's free it's free to subscribe young Uber how do you mean the onion my fishy my fire keeps the fires pranking me it keeps disappearing as soon as I go get it I'm on level 11 it stops you cooking every every time it's selling oh I'm in the fire now I'm sacrificing myself for nothing interesting happens use it on the fire

cooking making veal or I wasn't kidding okay I'm cooking by gas okay who's making that noise sounds like someone's building something building something back to the fishing we're getting oh pardon me sorry maybe we should be doing the cows you know that so we can get um uh how to say it so we can get combat and maybe we can do a few more quests that require a tiny bit of combat before so we don't get too wrecked is there a timetable for super membership or is it still soon it's still soon um basically it's gonna pop up once it happens so we need to submit ourselves and youtube takes this sweet time to review that and all that and once it's accepted it's up to the girls whoop by the pope brian brian speak and on you didn't put anything in the box thank you for the tip and on I appreciate it

if we all do and literally brieflings gave me a boat load of fish um to cook so once I stop burning fish I'm gonna like use them and I think that's gonna propel me quite a lot I want to do it all live on stream and like it's not gonna be behind a member stream or anything you guys can like we're gonna need a bigger boat I know you guys can literally come and join me at any point as well when we do these like kind of stream snipe things I also give you a boat load of money yes a reefling gave me 10 million GP I'm like Jagex is looking at the account like she's clearly bought right now I have zero wait you want to do it with us live yeah ASMR I have zero idea how RuneScape plays my friends just post images of the animal models in the game and they look very funny oh can I get a reefling pet I don't know how to get a pet in the game oh my god oh my god is there like a pet that looks like a reefling gold laundering literally Jagex is staring at my account right now could you imagine if

bots always running a barbarian village and we can literally pick up the fish that's on the floor my only worry is that it might be quiet and we might have to swap to a different server who owns this

gonna move on to the next place which is barbarian village I don't know if there's gonna be bot spam in there I could have sworn I came across a religion bot before that was spamming and it and I was like there is no way someone's paying for that it was the most bizarre thing this place has got to smell terrifying literally rotten fish on the floor everywhere burnt fish cooked fish like the whole of gellinore can smell our operation front over here wow hydration hydration hydration how is our fishing level so low what is that our fishing is 12 but our cooking is all the way up at 18 oh they did not have to go so hard on the music in this game but so good oh my god we're getting flexed on someone's got a fishing rod actually getting flexed on hold on is that how you pick up anchovies by the fishing rod well it means gonna force chat to get her done there's only all I'm gonna say is there's only one way to finish that game there's only one real way to finish that game you should work in the seafood business imagine getting followed by Jehovah's Witnesses even in old-school runes game honestly there's boss like and it's like why you get more exp for cooking rather than yeah there's only one real ending to that game and I will accept no other any food by strongy seafood if I see it I eat it oh that's good I like that could I interest you in our lordency yeah have you heard of our lordency for Brian honestly I think I can't remember if I said this or not I thought they're just shouting out like randomly I would just shout like the most common like boy names and like a chance for someone to hear their name just like jack and then just freak you out and then we just go back to the gameplay and I played nothing happened what's another popular boy name I have no idea Jacob so there we go okay and then we just go back to gameplay I played nothing just to like freak out whoever's listening and just be like oh my god that's my name most popular okay fill inventory okay now

like one more rack of fish and then we're done if I don't burn any actually they're really starting not to get burnt I'm really happy with that oh that's someone cutting down a tree that's what that noise is ripped to all those with this obscure yeah like that's the only reason I was like oh it's probably not that fun for those who have like obscure name type thing going on no strongy make it so

I play oh like someone just joins along well we I don't know if you uh we told some they were like what's going on and I was like oh some cringe vtuber's shroom in and they were like I'm world hopping and I was like okay thanks for an incident and literally no one cares thanks um am I level I don't am I level 19 so oh I am like two fishies away from 20 and then we're gonna move to barbarian village which is west of the grand exchange um strongy has power to actually do eh crusted chef's hat weird flex that happened to me in final fantasy our marshmallow is anonymous yes um if you have firefox it might be able to translate the screen automatically sometimes a thousand why um I am going to make another cup of tea hop on stride is a yo um I'm gonna make another cup of tea because my voice is absolutely feeling it what do you mean doing multiple 12 or streams back to back is straining on the throat oh it says 10 is that like a runescape like congrats 10 balloon I saw that wait hold on let me make it look oh my god he's getting performance anxiety making that fire look it's a 10 he must have got it for 10 oh you don't look at your shirt what is it's like the logo let me zoom out a little bit it was the 10th anniversary how old is this game there's too many people well another cup of tea you mean a cup of tea for the non endurance stream right yeah surely as I say hold on the four hour mark and we're not even like level 20 and cooking yeah not an endurance stream at all oh google chrome apparently translates marshmallow as well but now if I send the marshmallow you'll know it's me no actually because I'm not opening them up right now and for some reason marshmallow puts like five questions from like loads of different times together at once it doesn't make any sense send the most horrendous cringe marshmallow and sign your name at the bottom like a gigatab I played when I was five on my older brother's account oh did he like force you to go questing that's funniest anything this isn't runescape huh it's old school runescape oh no we're getting corrections oh wow doing bot run on your brother's account for him oh I said Lamalle twice in the same sense oh my god cringe so cringe give it here you're in a level 14 fishing I mean we're getting somewhere oh no I think I might need pee pee bye bye time as well actually yeah a tea and a pee might but not a tea not the pee in the pee but I need a pee in the pee in general key quest is how often are these old school rooms I was gonna do a few endurance streams I have no idea how long cooking takes so I was gonna do a few endurance streams of it I was gonna try and finish it in one month but I don't know if that's just being like far too crazy cut off fish wrapper needs the tea and a pee on runescape with the refunds doing nothing hunting for shrimp I can't rhyme can't do it I don't know how people do it at the same time you can reasonably get night night cooking less than 30 hours okay I know currently we're not maxing but it'll do it'll do I'm gonna do that we did it 30 hours of one tick clicking level 20 cooking do we still burn shrimp on 20 with carab one this carab one's a real thing it might be in print oh I don't think you burn after level 20 a reefling check for those of you who are on a fresh account what level are we looking at 20 as well you guys 20 carambuas or oh she sees okay you're done I've got 21 I've got 23 how are you all faster than me okay we'll go a little reefling okay what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a pee and a tea a classic um and we will be back hi how's runescaping we're doing good uh if you ever wanted to join in we're in world 3a top right there uh why is my latest tip we're not working it should be rotating right now sorry latest and uh and then we're gonna move to barbarian village next and we're gonna see what happens if there's oh wait no we can hmm the problem is I don't want to mute the in-game chat because of the bots I'm gonna go to bed have fun cooking oh well thank you for everything thank you for the extortionate prices for the shearers and all that um I just realized we would probably have to fat fly fish the fish ourselves unless we went to the grand exchange but only I have access to all the fish in my inventory so it's not like we can share it out equally hmm the bots on this world won't speak I mean I can't I just ignore them if we have to fly fish I think we need like level 20 fishing so we would be here for a bit longer hmm but rest well there's reeflings that do need to sleep yeah we would need 20 for the trout hmm oh sorry I just like we need fish and wine maybe we should pray but how can fish fly are you telling me this fish flies hmm I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm not sure you guys want to be held here for another what it were until we get like the actual level needed hmm I'm thinking but my brain isn't really coming up with any solutions it's either no there is no solution we have to keep being here until level 20 fishing and then we can move on it's gonna be a long road either well yeah literally if it takes 30 hours of like are you telling me a shrimp right this way are you telling me I've cuddled this fish yeah um if it's going to be a 30 hour stream anyway congrats on 20 no questing for airy levels suck hmm yeah we're also pretty low on combat for fresh starts as well which is a bit hmm I don't know what we should do are you telling me I cuddled exactly you can do miss the mystery well here that quest is right here oh do we need okay how about that we go for a T and a P and we're gonna do some more questing just to break up the the fishing because that was quite a few levels we've got with fishing so we'll go do some questing and and then it can be broken up a little bit because I don't want to like hurt you too much just doing it over and over oh no you mean we have to stay here and keep chatting forever I would hate that oh wow oh that would suck yeah I'm glad I'm glad you enjoy my rambles but just as a reminder Emmy is live playing uh the coffin of Andy congrats a few names Andy and Lele congrats a few names Ashley or Lele nicknames Lele um then we are going to do a few more quests free quest just to break it up a little bit because I don't want you guys being bored out or not but we will start the cooking grind soon another German name for cuttlefish is Tintin fish a a Tintin fish a Tintin fish oh my gosh okay thank you for the tip iron report the German name for cuttlefish is Tintin fish I did it in a German at hallo leutard a Tintin fish a Tintin fish I can't do it I am a big Tintin fish then I mean um level congratulations you reach a total level of 75 oh I'm flexing on other RuneScape players right now with that flexing Tintin fish equals an ink fish oh that's such a cool translation so Tintin Tint as in tint of a color and it's ink tint and so it means tinted fish the tint of the ink oh that's so cool wow why did I stop cooking I wish I was that high level sad face he says no one feel well he's probably like billions of levels higher than us tint and ink oh my god ich liebe ich liebe ich liebe Deutschland yeah okay I am going to go make a tea and pee whilst I fish hopefully this fishing spot doesn't despawn and then we're going to do a quest okay so I'll be back in like three minutes now okay give me three three oh excuse me that was a mcdonald's bag from yesterday I do apologize if you heard that picked up in mic okay I'll be right back I'll be three minutes pee in a tea please get up and stretch and get some water or hydration or anything of course that freaking despawns how dare you disrespect I've been shown by this fishing spot you got Mickey D's yesterday oh well okay right I very quickly go I'll be as quick as I can okay wait do I need to cover the screen I don't know I don't think I have to but yeah just in case so you see my email I'll be three minutes okay I was you Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I will sing the actual this song this song can probably just leave the screen on okay I can give me the on when I sing pe-peeeeeeeeeeee wait why is he greeting Wait, what do you mean disconnected? I'm not disconnected! Wait, why are you greeting? What are you saying? She loves us. What? I never said that, didn't I? Because I went for a tinkle. You have 30 days. She's back quick, hide the memes. What were you doing while I was away? I've been away for a few minutes. How was the pee? It was not a lot of liquid again and I've literally finished up all the water. So, and I had a tea, and I finished a can of cola. I've got another bottle of water here. I don't know if you can hear my nails kind of against it. I'm gonna try and finish that and the tea. I'm not really sure what's going on. I'm being pranked. I've been pranked by my body. Wait, why does someone say she doesn't love us hard eyes? What? By the way, reeflings are the best. You say Coca-Cola. I hear burps. Cola burps. Cola burps. We did kiss the homies. Don't tell Amy that, she'll be jealous. I'm freaking, wait, I just caught an anchovy. What does it do? Oh wait, I'm now catching an anchovy because I'm a level? Oh, maybe that'll speed up the fishing level gain. Okay, I didn't know that. You put anchovies on a pizza. I don't think I've ever tasted that before. Burps. Oh, I was so proud when Shabee started burping in her streams. I was like, oh my god. My literal daughter. Oh my god. With all the tea she drinks, Johnny will be really sophisticated. That's not bad. The burps are hot. I don't understand the appeal of it, but then someone said, think of it about the aftermath. Give your run air back, I believe. We get to rate more mouth pranks. Why do you keep on firing? That's why there's a freaking fire. I'm getting pranked by the spine. Oh, I'm still burning stuff. I'm not level. I'm literally cooking level 22 and I'm still burning. That's pretty rough after this. This is taking us a hot second. Right, so what fishing level do we need? We need fishing level 20. Shabee made a burp speed. She's indeed cheaper. Exactly. That's what I thought. Tea bag in the fire. It's running, I kneel. I get so many things like, oh, I kneel for all the choices. The barbed village spot has a permanent fire to cook on. Oh, right, I'll put my tinderbox and axe away. And then we will buy fishing gear. We farm until 20 fishing. I did know that. Yeah, we're going to do 20 fishing and then we're going to buy rods because some of us don't have that attachment. And then we get to go to Barbarian Village and we fish and we just keep doing that for a while. I think maybe we could get 40 doing that because salmon. However, the problem is the cost of feathers, but the problem's already been solved thanks to reeflings literally giving me an insane amount of in-game currency. Oh no, we're doing a quest. I completely forgot. I apologize. We are fishing level 20 fishing and then we're going to do a quest that's right here that begins with M. We're going to do maybe three quests just to break up the little fishing segment a little bit. It's called Mythilene Mystery. Mythilene Mystery. Burps are saying you ever like come through around someone. I am like, yeah. Some people like get taught it's really rude manners. Like obviously it's rude, like you wouldn't be in a job interview and burp in there. Actually speaking of burping in job interviews, I'm like 90% sure I accidentally burped when I was interviewing one of the girls revealer now that I think about it. Absolutely mortified. I think it might have been in me. You know that? No, it couldn't have been in me. I think it might have been Mercy. Someone had burped and I was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry. Did you hear about the Talon chef who died? He passed away. Oh, that didn't go, that didn't go down well. 32, I think to stop burping, burning shrimp. Level 32, you stop burning shrimp. That's insane. Brian. Stronny, I hope you're proud. I was reading a comic earlier and all I heard was your voice. I'm so cooked. Oh, did that actually happen? Am I in your head? Thank you, Senpai. Am I in your head? Is my accent in your head? Okay, hopefully that hypno's off, that reverbs off on the mic because I actually I didn't say a thing that tells me if it's on or not. Always in your head. Soon, world domination. Soon, the first 99 cooking, okay. It's more attractive if someone doesn't care about it. Giving my wood the sort of group. What? Who is Riefling is this? Come get your Riefling. You've been in my head for a long time, Stronny. Cryo Freeze, Momento. See, Stronny, that's why I didn't want the undo button. Want an undo button. Right, I'm definitely cooking fish a heck of a lot faster now. Catching fish, my apologies, not cooking. We need to video game OST ranking. Okay, that slightly slows down progress now that we're also getting anchovies as well. I keep accidentally trying to use fish on people. I've literally slapped so many Rieflings with shrimp right now and feel really bad. Hopefully touching your legs with my shrimp. I'm like, please take my raw shrimp. At 21, I can finally turn cream. But we all turn cream together at the same time. If you look at it, it's kind of like a cute little fishing campsite. Riefling's on. There's a place to turn cream and lump. Wait, we can actually do it? Hey, I thought we had to wait for another time for doing that. Honestly, right by Farmer I didn't even know you can turn by. Take it, take my raw shrimp. I'm really happy that you said you love Germany. It's the first time we've worn something. Deutschland Uber alles! Deutschland Uber alles! There you go. That's like all the German I could come up with. Just Deutschland Uber alles. Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaver. Wait, I don't know why. Nope, that wasn't it. Don't do that again. Why? Hold on. I'm going to try, I don't know why it doesn't like that. I don't know why it's frozen. I'm so sorry, my little scroll and don't know things frozen. I'm gonna have to fix that next thing. Well, no way you can say that. Wait, what does Deutschland Uber alles means? Wait, if I just said something really bad, I thought it meant like Germany number one. Like China number one. What did I just say in German? Did I just say something really bad? I thought it meant China number one, but German number one. What did I just say? Did I just say something really bad? It sounds like... No, it's fine, but it can be associated with other stuff. I am so sorry, bitter. I am so sorry. I thought it meant China number one. Let's just forget about it. I am so sorry. I genuinely thought it meant China number one, but Germany number one. When you learned your German from Call of Duty, unironically, like... Oh my God, idiot, absolute idiot. I'm so sorry. I do apologize for that. It's the first line of a national anthem. Oh wait, it's the first line of the national... German national anthem? It's only problematic if you use in a specific contact. Oh, okay. Shawnee, tomorrow will start to pop out strange fan art of you in a strange and nostalgic outfit. Just remember, I don't own rights to previous things. That's what you're gonna... Like, I might not be able to interact with it if you're maybe getting a bit too cheeky. Yeah, their national anthem from 1930s. Wait, not... I'm sorry, I really didn't... Which Germany... Oh God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh, genuinely thought it meant China number one. Like, I don't know if you guys ever played pub G or something, pub Newgrounds or whatever. But everyone used to come in and go China number one. And that was it. That's basically what I thought I just said, but I did not say that at all. Don't worry, I'm new here. How do I find where you are on the map? So when you open up map, you will start here right outside of Lumberge. And you just take a... Or maybe you started at the quest guy. He's like literally right here. You want to go south. You can always use this cross here and click it and it will make everything like north point north. And then just come south through a graveyard and we are literally all here. So south through a graveyard and south again. Brian! I'm so sorry. I didn't... I genuinely didn't know what it meant. I do apologize. I thought like... I thought everyone was like yay because I said Germany number one. And there's a few German watchers and no, I'm just an idiot. So yep, there's that. Apologies. Sorry. Thank you for the tip. I do apologize. Ah, cringing at myself. I'm like, oh, maybe I should cut that segment out of the void honestly. I don't want anything happening. Like anything weird happening. Don't stress about it. Okay, I'll try to get there. I can't stop laughing. No, I don't laugh at me. I literally... Anyone got a fire? Yeah, probably take that out. I want to ask, how are you already so good at this? I watched someone else try and they only have two quests left in FTP but still need attack. Oh, I'm not good at the game. What? You were literally in it with us. I'm rubbish at the game. Well, actually we have one, two, three, four and five. We have five quests done. Oh wait, are you memeing? I watched someone try and they only have two quests left in FTP but still need a taxi to Viroc. Oh right, because I actually threw the game. What's the timestamp? Hold on. Four hours and like 38 minutes. Hold on, I need to make more of that. Four hours, 48 minutes. Oh, be on my... Right, there we go, wrote a note. Time to get this board chopped up. We have other... Another 90 levels of cooking in front of us. Don't let your... Your not... Sorry, the love heart's in the freaking way. In fact, it's in the way again. You're not Dutch knowledge, so... Hello, I am a Dutchman. I know how to speak Dutch. Yes, I know how to speak Dutch. Only 13 million XP to go. No, no, no cuttles, we're laughing with you. I was laughing at you. Okay, okay. Relaxing stream. Okay, I'm glad you find it chill like that. I'm sorry, I'm at the stage where I'm now cringing at myself thinking I thought that meant Germany number one in all the contexts that I'd ever seen that phrase. Anyway, I'm going to drink my tea and I'm probably going to cringe myself to sleep tonight. Have you declared... Have you declared war to something with that sentence or opened a bakery? Good people. Hopefully the bakery. You're fine. Oh no, is there fire maker going offline? I will make us a fire, don't you worry. Come, let me go get a tree. I think there's a tree in the swamp or something. Is there not a dead tree in here? Am I going crazy? I could have sworn there's like a dead tree in the swamp that you can... Oh, there is. I'm going to get jumped by a frog, but I'm going to be so quick with froggy and got time to attack me. Oh, I'm full. All right, drop, take the tree, and then run all the way back to the tree. Oh, you made fire. Sorry. Oh my god, my woodcutting is so bad. It's going to take forever to cut this tree. Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it. I have 50, not to brag or anything, but I've got 50 XP in woodcutting. Let's see. Okay, okay, we're back, we're back, we're back. Just so you know, Germany number one means Deutschland of dying irons. Maybe next time. Yeah. Deutschland, Deutschland of dying irons. We're learning who said streams and educate your man, huh? Get that on fire. A whole 50, literally, not to brag. What if you moved on to higher tier fish? So we're currently trying to get fishing level 20, and then we're going to do some questing just to get over all XP, and then we're going to move on to higher level fish, just to kind of break it up with a bit of fun questing in between. I hope I don't pass out too early to the confidence of this company and me so hard. Learning that a Scottish cut official of Germany, yes, this is educational content you've chosen one for. Are you squidding me right now? If it's for you, then we'll start the third world. Thank you for the tip, iron reefer, hardy har har. No, no, bad Brian. Don't read that out loud, Brian. That's naughty. There'll be no world wars. If anything, I'm actually a field medic, so I'm here to stitch you up and give you all negative blood when you're perishing from blood loss. I'm literally a bad boy, Brian, bad boy. Don't say that out loud. Oh my gosh. No AI, the AI uprising. What's going on here? Oh, I'm itching my little schnozer. I'm going to take a sip of my tea and see if it's, oh my god, it's the perfect sipping temperature, truly a British moment when you enjoy, when you appreciate the temperature of the tea. What are we on for fishing? Oh wait, I'm on 18 fishing. What are you guys on for fishing? We must be getting close. We can do the quest very shortly. I'm going to put all of this in my bank though. I am not questing with all of this money on me. Sorry, don't kill some of the money. I'm zero negative life. The perfect cup of the perfect time, perfect dunking. Oh, what are they called? Apparently custard cream's got named the best dunkable biscuit. Oh, you're like, how are you guys higher level than me, honestly? Yeah, are you cheesy, don't run. Did the Scott have a British moment? Unfortunately, I do seem to share some traits. Can I even light logs or is it going to take forever? Because I'm such a low level in fire like making three, four. Oh, it took me four times. Honestly, that wasn't that bad. 15, but I had to step away a few times. Ah. Oh, you had to step away because my, my soundboard jokes were just too good. Remember the one time when Facebook released an AI on the internet and learned from the community that turned into the biggest thing going wrong? Oh, it's four men in uniform to carry my little souls through home. What should he do? Should have been a musician, but he didn't have the money for a guitar. What should he do? Should have been a politician, but he didn't have a property. This is not the song that was. Did we do it? We're almost there. We flings. We're so close to 20. We're so close. By the way, do you have a plan for stages of cooking levels that would do it chilling spot until 99? I absolutely have no plan whatsoever. I've returned with logs for my fire duty. I honestly have no plan whatsoever. We're going to move on to Salmon and Trout at Barbarian Village after we do some questing. And then after that, I think it's just jugs of wine. And we're literally going to be hanging out like maybe at the Grand Exchange on like a very quiet server. Oh, level 19 fishing. There might be a quest we're going to do. Sorry for letting my inner German out, my guess. By the way, do you, oh no, the fact that she didn't correct the message does mean that she already chose to go straight to level 99. Yeah, that's the plan anyway. We're going to do some questing just to break it up. And then we are going to jump back into it. I want to see if maybe we could do level 40 today. I don't think I'm going to do a full endurance stream as much as I love to harass you guys and destroy your sleep pattern. I don't think we're going to do a full 12 hour stream today. Also, my freaking VOD broke. Apparently the VODs break on 11 hours and 55 minutes, not on the 12th hour. So the end of my VOD got chopped away and it just cuts off. 15 trout, 20 is and 25 is salmon. Oh, we can make apple pies. Oh, I have a muffin. I have an apple muffin. I forgot to eat it yesterday. Yeah, something's like not really... YouTube VODs are almost especially the longer ones. Yeah. Oh, is it displaying again correctly? Maybe it changed. Yeah, they told us. That is a sad and frightening, so speaking super fast. M&M's got nothing on me when I'm saying bioreflums. Okay, I'm like, eh, that explains why all the other VJubers stopped 10 minutes before the 12 hour mark. Yeah, so unfortunately, we are having to bend the knee to the VOD overlords. I wonder, I suppose they had to give a number, like it doesn't matter. Circum... wait, I thought it said circumstance. Sure, you're not a mumble rat. Oh, I'm a mumble rat. I can assure you that much. I'm annunciating the words right now. I'm annunciating. Any annunciators? Oh, come on, catch that last one. Anything to do with this inventory full of shrimp? Drop them. If you go, you cook them on the fire and then you drop them once they're all cooked. It sounds like a decision made for some technical reason over at you. Yeah, like, I assumed they had to put like a number on it, but they couldn't just infinitely do it. Although there's those accounts that used to infinitely stream music, was it lo-fi girl or something like that? They just like constantly like keep going. I'll chug them all. If you go into sentence, you can hit, I think it's like controls or something, and it's like use shift to drop, and then if you hold shift, you can drop your full inventory stack really quickly. Okay, level 25 cooking. I'll take it, like we're getting there. It's if I could stop burning this stuff, if we stop burning, we'd be like literally flying through the levels. Right, 20 is maybe one more deck officially. Lo-fi girl never saved vods and didn't let you rewind, so that could be why. We are learning. Okay, more of my tea. I keep forgetting. And these fishes are hiding from me. So I assume it costs money to get some of these hysterics costumes, because these are like total costumes. I have to go in 10 minutes. I can't stay on Firejoy forever. Yes, that's okay. Don't worry, we can take over. We're probably doing by Quest next. But thank you for your service. Wait, hold on, 07. Thank you for your service on Firejoy. 07, we salute. Yeah, Wi-Fi, low-fi girl is more like a follower radio channel. Yeah. The only MTX in old-school RuneScape is Bond. You can stream non-stop, but when you end the VOD, it will only save the foot 11.55. Hmm. Well, I'll need to know that for the Donathons, because Azuras is first. 20! I'm finally fishing level 20. That took so long. I can drop them. Okay, we're level 20. We're gonna do questing once I finish this batch that I've got. And then we'll go to the bank and drop off all our items and see what this Quest mini thing is all about. I don't know if I need any items for it, is it this? It began with an M, so let's scroll down to M. Let's scroll up to M. Mystery, what do we need for that? We need, oh, we get a reward. What do we need for it? Recommended items, none. Enemies to defeat, none. Okay, right. We'll definitely do this. Nicely. Oh, she is right there. Okay, that makes perfect sense by that reefling. Suggested that silly of me. If we're going to do some quests, we're going to the city, then we're going to the city, then the door closes, won't close back. We're gonna put our items away first before we continue with the questing. I actually have to go to, don't worry if you have to go, thank you so much reeflings for hanging, I appreciate it. I am going to try and get level 99 in one month for cooking, so there will be plentiful opportunities to come hang. I'm also going to do it during the week instead of on the weekend as well to give the people who work on the weekends a chance as well to come in and join in the fun. Okay, everyone who is fishing, if you want to cook the fish, we're going to take it to the bank, if you want to cook it the new, and then we're going to make our way to the castle, and then we're going to come back and, oh, my fire, my fire perished. So get cooking, good looking. Oh wait, that's the song, hey, good looking. What you got cooking? It's shrimp on a fire, shrimp on the barbie. Oh, we're so Aussie out here. Can you go back to the mystery area after you finish? Oh wait, should we just do the quest? Reeflings have done the quest, should we just do the quest now instead of going all the way back and like here again? I finished my tea, yeah, you can't. Do they actually eat a lot of shrimp in Aussie land? I don't know, just do the quest, okay, we'll do the quest. I'll wait for everyone to finish up and do their thing, and then we'll start. So let you guys cook, those who are fishing, you can un-fish and cook, and then we'll start with this quest, and we'll pick another one. We'll do three quests I think, and I either need to do stream split recording, yeah, for the donathons, I know you need to do back to back, so I'm actually gonna have to get like a video put together for Azura to play when she goes to sleep. Hopefully her PC doesn't explode midstream. Should be a way to sleep in the thing just catch some fire in the corner of the room and she's like, okay. We eat prawns. Are you squidding me right now? Who goes there Brian? Do you read Patreon messages? No, so none of the talents have access to Patreon messages because it's like direct messages, so they don't have access to that stuff? No. So no, I read Marshmallows though, your mother won't come to send a moishie. I'm drinking water now after finishing my tea. Okay, is everyone almost ready? I'm gonna drop three inventory space, I'll just drop three anchovies, why not? Right, we will talk to this lady, I'll put walking on. Let's see what happens. Help, help! Start the quest. Sure, are you guys ready to come over? I'll get to 20 later. Yeah, we can always come back and do our thing. Thank you for the tip though Anonymous. You really are shy, you could ask that for free, you didn't have to give me money to ask that question. You guys are always welcome to ask and chat, I know it can be never again, or you can ask in Marshmallow but I might be sold to respond because I'm not reading Marshmallows right now. Thank you for the tip but save your money at the same time, seriously. Ray, are we ready? Are you my refillings? You are. You're not quite ready, hold on. Oh, sorry, right, I'm accepting the quest. What has happened here? We were invited to house party on the island, not far from here, something felt wrong about the whole thing but we went away. The house seemed pretty creepy but everything was going fine, we were having a good time and that's when we got attacked and I tried to save her. Huey brought me enough time to find an old boat, I went back to get him but it was too late, I'm scared he won't make it. You have to do something, they can't get away with this. What do you want me to do? That cycle is still out there, you have to bring them to justice. The boat we escaped on is just over there and you can use it to get to the island. Okay, I'll see what I can do. I need to fight, I hope not. Can reflings see this boat over here? Are you pointing the way? Let's check that you're all here. Who's got a refling? Got a few. Okay, end of the boat, end of the boat. Benjens, how bold of you considering she has a plan? Strania, I was wondering if you were following some kind of gay deciding to do, nah I'm just going for it. We're literally doing quest and right now like I'm already getting distracted from the 99 grind. Okay, I think that's all my reflings, these are actual plots. Okay, into the boat we go, yippee! There's a chance you ask the question and check, typically better chance, I don't know. I know but you can still do it for free, just like keep, like if I miss it then ask it again in like a couple of minutes. Oh my god, there's so many of us doing this quest right now, we're gonna overload this. It looks kind of familiar. Oh, okay, we need to take a left refling, for those of you who don't have the plugin, we're gonna pick up this bucket right here on the left. Oh no, is it instance bucket? Why are we taking the bucket? Pick up from the bucket, is it an instance bucket? Oh no, we can all take it, okay, that's good. Okay, drop. Okay, everyone get a bucket, pick up your bucket, subscribe by the fountain. Oh my god, the beacons are lit, Gondor calls trade. Okay, and then we have the barrel of rainwater, interact with it, we need to search it. Okay, there's like lots of noises going on. Whoa, party on, bro. Oh, it's like that movie that I've not seen. Whoa, the wind totally just felt like sun breathing on my neck. Oh, not cool, bro. I feel woozy, gurg, I see the light. It's not my time, glurg, glurgle, gargle. Oh, that's a bit. I don't know what movie he's from, I've not seen it, but I've seen it, you know what I mean? I've not seen the movie. Help me. Man, you're taking a while to perish. Sid claps is on the ground in a crumpled mess, as he falls down, you spot something shiny fall out of his shirt pocket and into the barrel of water. Gosh, that was horrible and so drawn out. Oh, wow, he's still going. I think he's actually gone this time. Who are you? Why are you doing this? He didn't say anything. Scary movie. Oh, it's scream. I've got to find a way into that house and stop this maniac. I wonder what it is that I saw fall into that barrel. Search the barrel, reflings. The barrel's full of rainwater. I can't see what's in there. Oh, right, click on the barrel in your inventory and use it on the barrel of rainwater. You fill the bucket from the barrel. Okay, now what? Now we search the barrel. You find a key at the bottom of the barrel. Are you saying strongly? Okay, now we go to the front of the house. It's so scary. Oh, it's making a good noise. Chop down. No, open large door. Okay, here we go. The bunny went ahead. I saw that bunny. He closed the door behind you. Let us in the house. Right, there we go. Oh, the door all closes. Hold on. I think the door all closed. Oh, does it all close? Wait, I can't even get in. Is this open large door? No. I think we're all trying to get in at once, right? I'm not clicking it. I'm just, okay, Danny. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, all right, I'm getting there. We're getting there. We're getting there. Hold on. Hold on. Why am I not going inside? It's not because someone's doing the door thing. It's one at a time. Right, okay, that's fine. Okay, okay, I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. Okay. Oh, that took the hot thing there. Right, let's get the other reflins in. Everyone in, everyone in. Okay, a few more. A few more reflins, fewer stragglers. Can you come? Can you come? One more, one more, and you come, and you come. Click that door. Right, we're in, we're in. Everyone touch the table in the entrance way. Oh my goodness. There's a knife on the table. Touch that table. Ooh, we're touching the table. Okay, once you've touched the table, touch this door. Ooh, the door, the door. Oh, cut scene. Knock, knock. Who's there? Oh, no. Gurgle. Oh, he said you're next to me. Oh, he's using cheat see doodles. What's this? A note? I guess I should read it. Ooh, let's go get the note. Oh, you left the note, okay. It should be a note to your left. You take a copy of the note. Ooh, let's read it. Isn't murder just the work of art, beautiful yet haunting like the blade of a knife as we wander through the valley of death? Ooh, spooky. Oh, okay. Is this on the other side? Oh, okay. Everyone enter this room. It doesn't really, really much of a room. Oh, it's a some room anyway. Oh, look at this painting. Wait, why am I getting turned this way for the painting? Hello? Hello? Okay, examine painting. Wait, what am I supposed to do? Oh, use the knife on the painting. I didn't even know I had a knife on me. Use the knife in your inventory on the painting. Beat that painting up. Show it to your mean boss. You slash open the painting revealing a hidden storage compartment. Search painting. You find a key hidden inside the slash painting. Oh, okay. If you found your key, come back out into the entrance way. If you've got the key from the painting by cutting it up into the entrance way. Okay, just a few more. Use the knife in your inventory on the painting in that room. And then once you've got the key, come back into the hallway. We're doing it. We're questing. They have a higher pit than you. Man, what's a pit? Are we good? There should be a knife in your inventory. And then you can highlight it by using right click and then slash the shizzle of it. There you go, you key. Alrighty. And then we go through this door right here. Oh, there's a reefing party in here, clearly. Oh, so it's spooking us behind the door. Okay, once you enter this new room, there's a little orby thing to the left. I don't know what it does, but it's highlighted. Examine the unlit candle on the wall. Oh, we're to tinder box or to tinder box, the thing on the wall. Tinder box, the unlit candle. Oh, wait, do you guys need a knife or a tinder box or is it like in this room? Do you guys need me to trade this? There's a bunch in here. Okay, okay, that's good. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, literally all in the shelf. There's a tinder box on the shelf if you need help. You light the candle. So light the two unlit candles. Oh, there's a third one as well. Oh, excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Video Game. Oh, I just touched my fish. Hold on, wait. I think she's more happy of the fact that there's only 20 people doing the same. Literally, Jagex is like, what on earth? I'm sure they've had it before where people go questing together. You light the candle. The room is sufficiently warm. The fuse should now have dried out. Oh, once you tinder box all the things, do the barrel? I don't know. And get the heck out of the room. Get out of the room as soon as you light that thing. Hold on, let me run. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room. Oh, the thing about to blow. Oh, okay, okay, okay. All right. Hey, it's the shadow one that kept closing the doors on me. That's not a knife. This is a knife. Why are you so excited if I touch the doors and noodles? I'm just like, it's so fun being like, oh my God, request them together. And for those who don't have room light, I'm like, I'm the quest teller, you know? So once you've let everything and blew it up, we can all go outside in this section. So I'll wait for the reeflings to come over. Yeah, they're like having to get out the room because it's blowing up. I just find it really fun getting to play games together. Momelo. So we're getting the God Sword, right? I don't know what the God Sword is. We are all here merely by coincidence. There's absolutely nothing in common that we all have. Is there anyone else in sake? Are you kidding me right now? Brian. It's 1am. I have to tap out. Sleep well. Enjoy the rest of your stream with the reeflings. Thank you so much, Pajango. Please rest well. Maybe see you in the morning. I don't know if this is endurance yet. Yes, there's four candles in that room to light on the walls. You take a tinder box from the shelf, little tinder box on the shelf, and then you light all four candles in the room. And then there'll be a powder keg that you can light here just on the outskirts of that room. It will blow a hole in the wall, but you need to light it and then leave the room. So it blows up. And then that's you. Or that door. I mean, you're not wrong. I don't know if it blows up if you go out on that door, but the other door. Or did it blow up? Boom. Okay, there you go. I blew up. I think that's all the reeflings. I don't see anyone else hiding in that room. Can you come over? Yeah! Okay, reeflings. Let's go next. Let's go next. We're doing it. Oh, if you click here on the foot, on the mini map up here, it'll put running on. So if it's brown, it means you're walking. If it's golden, it means you're running. Your stamina will regain eventually. So don't worry. Oh, suspiciously. Let's observe this suspicious tree over here. Please stop this. Just let me go. Oh, it's kind of messed up. We're going to play a game. Do you like to play games? Yeah, no. Yes, whatever you say, just then it hurt me. Whether you get hurt or not is entirely up to you. Your fate is in your own hands. What? What do you mean? Leave her alone, you monster. Ah, Scottlefish. How kind of you to join us. Now, if you say another word, I will end her right now. Sorry, where were we? Ah yes, of course, the game. Do you like quests, Lissy? Uh, sure, I like quests. Do you like scary quests? Uh-huh. What's your favorite scary quest? I don't know. You have to have a favorite. Uh, the one with a vampire in it who lives in the big house. Good, good. And now for that game I spoke about. I am going to ask you one question. Get it wrong and you die, but get it right and you live. How is that fair? Oh, gothicks. Please, gothicks? Isn't that a type of armor? Oh, gothicks, please, no, please, don't. I don't want to die. Then think hard about your answer. You like vampires, so this should be easy for you. The question is, who is the vampire that resides in South Mish? I would be perishing. Um, I'm to say nothing. I'm not, I'm not to say anything. He said he's gonna slash her if I say anything. Oh yes, yes, I know it. Count Draenor. Ha, in your face, you masked freak. Oh, Lacy, Lacy, Lacy, I did tell you to think hard about your answer. Count Draenor is in fact a vampire and he does reside in his manor in Mithilith, but that manor is in West Mithilith. I was talking about Count Chek. Thanks for playing. No, no, you tricked me. This isn't fair. Ask me another. Gargle, gargle, gargle, gargle. The writing in this game is, I think it's because I have, oh, he's leaving his notes? Okay, I'll take the note. Do you like jazz? Take the note, please. That monster, oh, I can't do that because I actually only clicked on the note. Oopsies, take note. You take the note, what does it say? It's like music to my ears, the glory sounds spelling out your fate. Oh, okay, get into the, once you pick up the note, there's a piano. Where to do something with it? Someone is throwing Easter eggs everywhere. Play piano. Okay, once you're on the piano, delta, echo, alpha, delta. Did we do it right? Oh, there's a compartment. Can I play for real? Oh, you can't. You can't play this one. You can't play this one. You can't play this one. Oh, I think my inventory is full, hold on. I think there's something I'm supposed to grab. Play piano, search piano, search piano. Oh, once you play that, delta is just, I don't see a delta button. Oh, very funny, very funny. Oh, it spells out dead. Do you like metal? Does baby metal count as metal? I like OST from Doom. Doom? Yeah, Doom 2007, BFG is probably my favorite, if that counts as metal song. Has everyone got the key? If you got the key, come up the hallway a little bit. Oh wait, we're, oh no, we're supposed to go back. Okay, if you've got the key, come out of the room. Let's see if there's any, who's not got the key? Got the key, got the key. Someone's, I don't know if someone's in that cutscene with the guy. Spelled dead on the piano from the left side. Is that Hatsune Miku? It's Hatsune Miku. Hello guys, my name is Hatsune Miku. I'm thinking Miku, Miku. There's a refling here, but I don't know if they're in a cutscene or not, I'm not sure. I don't know what's happening with this refling, I think they might be AFK, but everyone, oh, I don't know. Miku, you're, Miku, you're mine. I think so. Okay, I think so, you're hanging out with us. I don't know, oh, oh, did you get the key? Do you need to do the piano bit? I don't know. Oh right, spell dead on the piano and then search the piano. And left side spell dead, if that makes sense. Damn, there's no cheer remote. There is in game. Wait, where is it? Cheer, cheer. Okay, that's the best I got. Sorry, I was AFK, I'll catch up. Yeah, just spell, yeah, yeah, there you go, you got it, you got the key. If you touch the piano and then on left spell side and then you should get key. I think everyone's got the key. Yippee, everyone's got the key, right, let's go. Come back inside the house from the side, we blew it up on the powder keg. Oh, it's a room full of reflings. Oh no, just me in a room full of reflings. Okay, come back into the entrance hallway. Oh, we're getting stuck on the door. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh, right, hold on. You again! It's him, it's him that's doing it. It's him that's doing it, I'm getting freaking stuck. Wait, how'd that come around? I literally can't progress. Stop it, I can't even get through. Or is it one by one? Oh, maybe a one by one, hold on. I might be accusing someone of closing the door and I think it's one by one. Oh, right, oh, sorry, sorry, I just, I'm sorry, refling. Miss input, miss input! Oh, it's a miss input, okay. Shawnee letting her imagination run wild. Honestly, honestly? Okay, so one by one door, take your time, take your time, it's one by one door. Right, here we come. Stop, refling! Let us come in. Everyone's got a better ping than me! Okay, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. Okay, then through the other one by one door. Oh, it's a cutscene. Accusing her own beloved loyal refling. Why am I the only one always left cleaning up after everyone? Shuffle? Hello, anyone there? Russell? Hello, Lacey said. Scratch. Hmm, well I guess I should go check it out. No point saying in this nice locked room when I could go outside into the creepy darkness. Seriously? The walls and doors seem too thick for Mandy to be able to hear you. Oh, and I don't think there is any need to take this big shiny weapon with me in order to defend myself. Nothing bad ever happens when people go check out noises in the dark outside the house. You have gotta be kidding. Okay, well here I go. Bando Scotsword. Hello, anyone out here? See, I knew nothing would happen. Must have just been a squirrel or something running about. Oh well, back to the dishes. Phew, that was lucky. Oh, he's behind you! No, why me? That psycho. He was just toying with her. Oh, we're getting left another note, I think. Is this talk to killer? Just look at what we can. We're in a cutscene. And he's hiding away again. Another note, this guy really likes playing games, but this is going to be the game he won't win. Okay, there should be a note on the ground for us to read now. Here, at first, these words. Each murder you witness helplessly from start to end as you fail to solve the final letters of this quiz. Razor sharp like a gemstone is the blade of my knife. The last sound you hear will be your screams echo. Hita, I will have the final word in this thriller. Okay, we need to go back into the hallway on the one-by-one door, so we need to be patient. I'm standing and lying. I was looking in soft lock by a door. Okay, there we go, I made it through. Wait, what was that? Oh, that makes sense. Is there a refland just out there chilling? Are you not doing the quiz? Are you just bing-chilling out there? Bing-chilling. Are you not sure what to do? Okay, and then one-by-one, we painfully go through this door again. Now we're getting waving hello, hello. Okay, we need to check out the fireplace. Okay, or also known as the heart. Oh wait, this is chopped on tree. Examine the fireplace with a knife. Use the knife on the fireplace. You use the knife to pry open a loose brick in the fireplace, revealing a secret panel Search fireplace. You find a panel of switches inside the hidden compartment. Each switch is crafted from a different gemstone. Click sapphire. Click diamonds. Click zanyate. Click emerald. Click on it. Then click ruby. Blue, white, orange, green, black, red. You hear a click sound. You find a hidden key. Okay, that one's a bit more. SD, Z, E, autumn. How are you supposed to figure that out? I love riddles in this game. Must have been the wind. Would you be upset if it was ink you were cleaning instead? Oh man, I can't believe this. I can't find my old character anymore. I wanted to bring in a high-level character to help out. I don't worry. Also, there's a boss fight now. I don't have any combat. The final letters of the note. Oh, I have the final word in this form. Okay, okay, that's actually wee bit smart. I'll give it a wee bit smart. Just a wee bit. One by one door. One by one door. One by one door. One by one. Cheeky one by one. Oh wait, is everyone done with the hearth? God, you guys were so quick at the hearth. Okay, Cheeky. Cheeky one by one door. That's it. Let me in. Stop! You don't even need to come in this room. You've already done the quest. Bruv, I don't have high enough ping. I can't get out. I actually don't have high enough ping to get out. I'm not even being funny. My ping is so bad. I can't get out. Bruv. I don't know what to do. My ping isn't fast enough to respond. The background keeps reminding me of the godfather. I've never seen the godfather. Is it gay? Fail to solve the final letters of this quiz. Fail to solve the- Ah, okay, okay. Oh, okay, it works. Okay. Alright, in you go. Right, once we're back in the engine's way, we one by one on the door over here. We're spinning on the door. Let's refling. Here we go. And then we go. Boom. We got a cutscene. I wonder if there's a way to make the text bigger. Show yourself, you coward. Monkey. Monkey, is someone gonna get stuff? So, we meet at last. I have to say, I'm impressed you worked out my riddles. Well, maybe you aren't as smart as you think you are. Or really, all the dead bodies suggest otherwise. And what did you do to stop them? Nothing. People think you are some big hero, but no, you're not. All your adventures are the same. Nothing but opportunists. What are you on about? Well, I did have this big speech planned out, but quite frankly, I don't think you're worth the effort it would take to deliver it. So, this is the end of the line for you. It is time for the final act. The showdown. The finale. Let's see if you're up for the challenge. Probably not. I'm too- Ah, if I die, do I lose all the money that's on my hand? Push mirror. The mirror can't be pushed any further. What are you on about? Oh no, I missed. Wait, is there like a timer? Hello? Oh. Logic puzzle? Wait, do I need to like- Do it all the time? Wait, hold on. Push. And then push. And then push from here. Boom. Oh, what? He changed. I don't know which one he's coming from. Did I just have to guess? Oh, for goodness- Wait, I can't see when it's coming. Is it that one? I think I'm too. Like, can you just randomize to this one where I've already said it all? Please, that'd be great game. Wait, I'm supposed to run about that fast? I don't think I'm that fast. I'm fricking too late. And- Oh, right. Okay, there's like a weird shadow thing, but I don't know if I'm that fast. Seriously. I'm not that fast! Oh. Bruv. Did I just need to camp at one? He's too fast! Oh my god, he's like so fast! Hold on. Oh, please be it. Oh no! Oh, right, okay. Wait, I don't even know where it's coming from. Oh, right, okay. Shadow, shadow. Okay, he's doing it again from that one. Okay, okay. Quick, quick, quick! Is it- Oh, shit, I'm too- Please be this one. No! The randomizer is so cruel. You know for a fact you can randomize elsewhere. Okay, another one, another one. Oh, dang right out. All right, okay, okay, okay, we can do this, we can do this. One, two, and three. Oh, just in time. Oh, we did it. I flopped out. Oh, I think I may have underestimated you. You lost at your own game and now it is time to see who you really are under that mask. Wait, no, you, but why? Why on earth would you kill all your pals? Why beg me to come here and help them? You just don't get it, do you? So big-headed, so used to it all being about you, about saving the day. Well, I'm sick of it. What do you even mean? Adventurers, you're all the same. Everything always has to be about you. I don't understand. Of course you wouldn't, because you can't see past yourself. Believe it or not, I used to be like- Okay, at least to be like you, I hear about some dance alone distress and go to help. Have my moment for me to be the hero for once. But you, you and every other adventurer, every time I get there to help is too late. It's already solved. The disaster is averted. Reward has already been claimed. Every time you and those adventurers steal my moment, but not this time. This time, it's all about me. I'm the star of the show. Me, me, me, me, me. Well, not any longer. The show's over and there will be no curtain call. Oh, but there's always a curtain call. He he he he. What? How? There was two? Of course. Every good show needs a good support and actor. Now take off your mask, darling. Take a bow. You've earned it. Of course, my love. It's Sid! No, it's not. It's Harvey. I'm sorry. You, but how? You were almost heckin' gone. I saw your wounds. No, what you watched was what I wanted you to watch. A masterful performance, if I say so myself. But what's in it for you? Everyone loves the limelight and who better to share it with them, my beloved Abigail. But your friends? They didn't deserve to perish. Perhaps not, but neither did I deserve to be cast back into the shadows where I deserve the spotlight. Yes, well, we deserve the spotlight. And now I have my starring role, our starring role. Gelinor will forever remember this night and what I've done here. No, what we have done. Quiet Huey, this is my moment. No, this is supposed to be our moment. It isn't just all about you either. We're in this together. Stop ruining this, Huey. I have worked so hard for this and I'm not gonna let you take it away from me. Well, I'm not gonna be push aside either. We were both in on this as equals. We were never equals. How could you possibly compare to me? You're egotistical, selfish. No, my love. No, what have I done? It wasn't supposed to be like this, but you just couldn't let me have my moment. Why, Huey, why? I loved you. This could be my chance to take advantage of the situation. Okay, pick up the knife. I'm not going out of her empty-handed. Yeah, pick up, take the killer's knife. Yonk and I'm not go- wait, equip the knife, pick up the knife and equip it and then stab her. Take that, hack and slash. Well, thanks Sarah Domen. That's over. I should get out of here. Just like that. Are they still alive? I don't think he's in a very talkative mood. Are they both? Okay. Okay, let's get out of here. Let's get out. Let's get out. The crying says, you'll never escape me. You dare try and ruin- wait, what? NPC spot? Isn't she supposed to be parish? Try and ruin my moment. Oh, wait, no. Huey is hurt because of you. It's definitely to you. Oh, wait. Now it's time for you to join. Oh, you're not killing anyone else. Oh, again, absolutely. She's spanked by the- No, this can't be. She just got specked. Whoa, that was close. Mandy, how are you alive? I watched you get shanked. I did get stabbed, but I was born with a rare condition called Dextrocardia. Dextrocardia what? Dextrocardia. It means that my heart is on the right side of my chest, not my left. Oh, that's so specific. So when the killers thought they stabbed you in the heart, they actually missed? Well, missed the heart, yeah. I did still get stabbed, though. I'm actually feeling pretty woozy. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. I will wait outside the house after seeing to this stab wound. You should come talk to me there. Okay, okay, okay. Hey, right, outside the house if my- Oh, no, are you guys stuck on the mirror section? Are they stuck on the mirror section if they're still in here? Or are they just in the cutscene? Someone throw in their snowball. I'm starting to think you aren't throwing snowballs anymore. No witnesses, the roofling's never taught. My medieval fantasy game with medieval- Oh, my medieval fantasy game with medical term. There's still one more roofling stuck in there. Are you stuck on the mirror quest, beyond it? I'm on team finish faster than throwing it. I need to read it out. I don't think these are snowballs I'm getting covered in or something. Should I have fought Abigail? You pick up a knife. Oh, did you just leave? You might have to go back inside and redo that mirror section sadly. Whoa, wait, it's okay. I mean, did you shank her? All right. Oh, the roofling's out. Is that everyone? All the candles floor, all aboard. Oh, we're talking about humors and bail there. Okay, that's all the rooflings. Everyone into the entrance way. Turns out you can't fight her. Nah, you don't actually hurt Abigail yourself. Right, and then we talk. Oh, no, it's one by one door. Oh, it's our biggest enemy. It's literally our biggest enemy right now, one by one door. The game's like sending me away. Right, I'll wait for the rooflings to go first. I'll let the rooflings go because they've been playing with me without having a go time. No witnesses, the rooflings will never talk. Fair and square. The actual end boss of the game. I don't think there's snowballs either, but they may contain some terms in common. All done. Okay, we need to talk to the Mandy right here. Oh, hi, Scottlefish. Hi, Mandy. How are you feeling now? Much better. Thanks and lucky to be alive. Thanks to you. No small part. Well, we saved the day in the team, so thank you too. Here, I found this in the wardrobe. I don't want to take it, so please take it. We did it! We got another quest for level eight crafting and we got rubies for it. I like that. Well, I think we're ready to go back. Is everyone ready once you've collected your mission? The question is, what quest do we do now? We'll do the free quests. I'm level nine crafting. I went, oh yeah, you're just rubbing in my face. Looks like everyone's spoken to Mandy, almost. A few more wheat funds. Someone's really enjoying just talking to all the wood. Is that everyone? I'm just trying to check. Are you coming too? No? Yeah, no, maybe. Right, all aboard the boat. Who do I talk to to finish the quest? Mandy, she's outside that castle. Yeah, we did it! We did it! Wait, wait, let me do a celebration of moat. Can I jump in the air? We completed the quest! Okay, I think we should go to the bank and put all our items away and then we'll pick what quest to do next. What's a free quest? That's easy. Goblin Diplomacy is pretty easy. Erin is the chicken. I think you need to have combat. I think you need combat for Erin. Sleep well, good night, those who have to go. Good night, Trony. We'll see you there, Bessa. Until later, I don't know if there's anything easy. Erin is the chicken. It's probably the easiest we've got right now. I think we need to level up, so that's not only why we need to level up. Just a runaway segment. All kind. It's all the refunds here. Yeah, I've got some stuff to do. Try not to get food. For those who have to go, don't worry if you have to go. Understand, it's not possible. We'll do Erin is the chicken and then we're going to go back to fishing. Sorry, we're going to go back to leveling up cooking. Okay, is everyone here? I think everyone's here. I don't know if that other refling is still stuck on the island. Possibly. That went crazy. Didn't we just see him back on this island? Wait, there is a refling that got stuck on that quest? I think. It's called scrawny sea. Oh no, that was a good thing. Okay, see you later. Bye bye refling. Thank you for joining for the ones who have to leave. Don't worry if you have to leave in game. Right, if you want to follow me, if you hover on me, it should say follow. And then I'll take you to the bank and then we'll do Erin is the chicken. I don't know what is, but we'll do it anyway. Oh, I'll walk. Sorry, I'll walk. I always forget to walk. We've got a refling army, honestly. See you later alligator in a wild crocodile. Yeah, I want to, I want to go to the island. Why would you let me go? Did you guys see that Stephen Hawking meme? That sounds really terrible, but that's what the meme was. So when it came out that Stephen Hawking went on the island, someone like did a quote and it was like, I want to go to the island. Why won't you let me go? Oh, I just love the brave word. I know the stream isn't over yet, but when do you think the next runescape won? Probably in a week's time. My endurance stream is Skyrim for next week, but I am going to try and get 99th cooking. Where am I trying to go? I don't know why I need the map to go to the bank and all the bankers. My next, I'm going to try and finish 99 cooking. In one month, I want to finish 99 cooking. Bobby Lee or whatever. Yeah, yeah, that was it. No, it's just going to be vanilla Skyrim for my endurance stream next week. Endurance stream next week is Skyrim and Runescape. I don't think today we're going to do the full 12 hours because I've actually done quite a lot of 12 hours. Go upstairs on the top of the bank. How are you everywhere? Am I going crazy or is this a bot? Or is this a leafling that like is just no, like how are you leveling up outside here? What we didn't even get here. I'm going crazy. I swear that's a leafling. Right. Empty everything inside. I guess you can just drop the notes from that minigame. And then Erin is the chicken. I'm actually going to equip my sword and shield. I'm pretty sure I got unequipped for some reason and I don't want to be completely defenseless. I'm not out there. I think we just draw destroy you, I guess. Wait, am I not allowed to destroy the notes? They'll just put them in the bank then. Okay, I'm just putting the notes in the bank. I don't know why. No, that's me. All right. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I can just what I was like, I'm sure that's a leafling genuinely. Anyone want my three gems since I can't bank them? Oh, me, me, me, me, me, me. Send them to Mommy who said that. Me, me, me, me, me, head a... Ah, I can't trade you. What? Oh, I've only traded you? Oh, well, at least you can send it to me at least. Yeah, I dunno why I wouldn't want me to do that. Me, me, me, me, me. Oh, my god, my, my, my, my, no. We should fight the level 152 chicken at the gate, ill. Is that true? Is that real? I don't mean to alarm you, but NaNNa and Cookin make take... Someone said it can take 30 hours if we max it. I can't trade for another 52 minutes, that's okay. Err, right, erm, Ern is the chicken, we're gonna do Big Ernie the checkin' buck buck er, show on the map. We need to go, oooh, outside this location here. I don't know, do we level up? I feel like we need to do a bit of combat. Well we go kill cows for like, I'm not even kidding, we'll go, er, kill cows for like, five minutes. So we're gonna go across the bridge and get cows. Reeflings, come down to the castle, I'll wait for you at the front of the castle. Make sure you have a sword and a shield equipped, did you got it from Tutorial Island. A hundred hours are five strong streams of frogs in the lake! Honestly. Yeah, we go, right, we will just go outside the castello, er, and I'll make sure everyone, I don't see anyone coming down the stairs from there, I think there's no one. Everyone's on, you guys are quick, I don't think there's anyone, I don't see anyone. Okay, we're gonna cross the bridge, five streams must be short ones, honestly, er, just five streams. Ugh. Give me one second, I'm getting... I'm not gonna do this. Nine streams, one minute is like absolutely all of this. I'm getting... I'm getting a freaking seal, what? I'm getting a big difference. Ugh. Okay, I can breathe again. Right, we're gonna go into the cow's pen, and we're literally gonna go nuts in destroying all these cows up ahead. Okay, just so some people get nine in cooking by at skill 33 with 6,000 grapes and turning them into wine. Is that the fastest ice pee maker? I thought it was sharks, but sharks are expensive. Me. Oh, someone wants to trade, sorry, sorry, I didn't see the offer. What do you offer me? Poison? Are you telling me killing them? Oh my God, what did you do? Poison and fish food. Reefland! That's so mean! I got given poison and freaking fish food. Tell me, tell me you don't like me, without telling me you don't like me, Reefland. Sheesh. Right, let's absolutely destroy these cows. Even if you just get a few, like to level up, I guess. Even a tiny bit of a level up is better than nothing. Something about not being able to burn wine? Wine making's the fastest. Okay. Based Reefland, someone said. Okay, just get the cows, just attack the cows at all willy nilly. And then we can level up our combat a bit, because our combat is so low that we're like really vulnerable to pretty much anything. Destroy that Reefland. Mods, slap them silly. Mods, remove this man's chest. Just cult things. Why you following this noob? Just cult things. Okay, I love that answer. Is there more cows over here? Oh, there is! There's like tons of cows. Okay, and don't worry, you can attack everything in this field. We'll just level up. Oh, he said enjoy. We will hunt them down. Mods, put chewed up gum in this, in his best shoes. Mods, make sure his pillow is always warm. Yeah. See, we're like literally already covered. We're getting so strong. We're just beating absolutely everything up. Why did, actually, how did they know I'm a noob? Is that the way I dress? I'm literally wearing a thousand gold dreads, and they called me a noob. Not to brag, but my combat level is five right now. Like, I'm sorry, but runescape players quake when they see me. I'm sorry, they just quake when they see me. They can't help it. Their timbers are shivered. Whenever they see skullfish log in online. Oh, I've only got four health. I should maybe be a bit more careful, honestly. Oh, I've only got three health. Maybe I should be really careful. Hmm, I'm not sure I can maybe fight the baby cows. If I get beaten up by a cow, I'm going to be really embarrassed, okay? Oh my god, a baby cow, destroy it. Combat level five, literally. We quiver before you as well, but for different reasons. Oh my god, the way that we think rolls over as well is so sad. I'm planting some booms. All right. I can only attack baby cows, because I've only got three HP. I swear, if any reefling perishes against cows, I'm going to be embarrassed for result, okay? Oh, sorry, someone said they wished to trade. Sorry, sorry. Let me beat up this baby cow, and then I'll accept the trade. Wah, wah, wah. Oh my god, I'm on one HP. No way this baby cow is going to get me. Mauds, are you... I'm going to get killed by a baby cow. I need to get out of the field, oh my god. I'm one HP in a dream. Hold on, right, let's try that again. Okay, I literally am the one that's going to perish from the cow. Hold on, let me accept this trade. I'm so sorry. Chin up, offer? Oh no, can you not trade? That's okay if you can't do it in time. Uh, I guess we'll just hang about here, yeah? We're just going to hang about... Oh, they're cooking meat. Cannot trade, yeah, I'm a new account. It's because I'm not cleaning up. Do you have meat? Excuse me, little reefling. Uh, can I get some of your meat? Please, one bit of meat so I can heal. Just one meat. Oh, you not got any? I saw you cooking though. I do not have any. Oh wait, I can make some if I pick up some off the ground. Wait a minute, hold on a minute, I can do it my... I'm an independent strummer. Use the meat on the fire and then eat the meat. It's genius. I did it! Okay, we can go back to slay and let's go. We'll get a few more combat levels like this. Chicken's going to only hit zero, so that's good for you, accounts. No, we need a challenge for the coup. Uh, we're now attack level four. Oh my god, we're getting too strong. We can't handle this. When we enter the lobby... I'm going to actually cook again because I want to heal up. GGG. I'm gaming so hard right now. Oh no, I burnt it! I thought we were high enough level not to burn level one me, honestly. I don't know what combat level we are. We're combat level five. Surely that's enough for questing. Surely. Copium. Let me know wild strong, you can survive in nature. It's rough out in nature, it's rough. I just need to heal and then I can start walloping everything again. There, boom. Uh, let me keep the attack or is it better to like swap between like the same thing, so... Cows can burn. It's genius! Shit over here. Why do the farmers randomly let you perish their cows? Honestly, I'm not even sure. Wait, I think it might be faster to do like strength and then I might get like a combat level faster. I'm not sure if that's right though. I could be completely wrong about that. Wait, there's like more cows over here, we can use annihilate. Yeah, there's like tons over here. Best to train strength. Alright, maybe defense because like I've not got much HP points. Like I only got 10. Oh sorry, someone wishes to trade with me. Drop some meat over here if you want to strong any things I can't trade. The reeflings feeding me. Oh, they're feeding me. Thank you reeflings. That's a lot of meat. Jeez, you're a packin. Is that six whole meat for me? It is, thank you. Am I baiting to it? Oh wait, I'm already full health. Wait, I only have 9 HP? No, I have 10 HP, that's like tiny. Azura remainder. Azura duly is going live. I'm unsure what game she's playing. Oh my god, check out the outfit. Check out the drip. Let's say drip out in the color scheme. We're getting there, we're getting there. Surely. Oh my god, do you know what that reminds me of? I think the reason why I laugh so much at that is because of this. Right, hear me out. Hear me out. Where is it? Let me find it. I think that's why that makes me laugh so much. Because it looks so good. Oh my god. Let me find it. I think that's why that makes me laugh so much. Because it looks so ridiculous. That's the only reason I like the headbanging the most. This is absolutely ridiculous. Wow. I don't know. Is level 6 combat enough to not get attacked all the time? Sorry, I look sussy. Sorry, I said that wrong. I don't mean to say it like that. Oh, I'm level 2 strength. Check me out. Oh sorry, someone wants to trade with me. I'm sorry, I missed it. I'm too fatigued. I'm too enthralled with perishing these cows to get some level ups. Very beefy. I'm sorry. Look, I've got things on my mind, you know. Are the marshmallows up again recently? Oh yeah. Hee hee hee. Okay. Accept trade. What? Show me what you got. Oh, it's a strength potion and cooked salmon. Okay. I don't know how long. I only wanted to be here for like a wee bit and then we'll go straight back in to leveling up cooking. I accidentally save questing a little too much. What I wanted to do was get some levels. So when we do airness to chicken, we don't all perish. I think we can run away for whatever is going on. Oh yeah, you know all right. Hee hee hee hee. I just didn't want us to perish really quickly when we did airness to chicken. I don't know what Azur is live with. Thank you very much, Refling, for all the food supplies as well. Um. Almost like up my strength. Level up, level up. Ooh. Combat level six, unstoppable. Truly unstoppable. They cannot, they cannot. Strength potion for stronger. Ah. Okay, I took a sip. I don't know how long it lasts. Wait, where's the effect? I don't know how long these things, the pots last. Ooh. I've cast up this much of a fate. I fear what bulls are capable of. She can now destroy baby cows with ease. I truly am evil. Truly. I don't know how long it lasts. Strength potion, yeah. Top left the fist. So the strength boosts. 60 seconds? No, it does not last. It lasts 60 seconds. It's so small when you heal. Oh, salmon heals a lot, actually. We need to start like a salmon ring. Is it normal to heal multiple, strong voices simultaneously in my head? I hope not. If I left the echo on. One boosted start point, dreams every 30 seconds. That's so quick. Ooh. I'm no strength level four. I'm rolling these cows. There's no echo. Okay. It's just a reef flings finally losing the plot. I now can have a live in HP. Okay, maybe we should have done a bit of training a wee bit earlier. But look, we're leveling up. That's the main thing. We're getting there. I don't know if we should maybe go for like five. Hmm. I'm thinking he's becoming an extra strongy pill. So it depends on how strong your potion has boosted you. Azure is playing one shot. Like how strong he sounds excited every time she unlocks levels. It's so satisfying. It's like, you've unlocked a new level, but yeah, I have. I'm such a big girl. I'm so smart. It's MRT. Hmm. Hydration check. I think the echo effect, if I was playing a video game, doesn't sound that good. Like, this is, for example, what would sound like, oh, I'm just killing this dude right now. It just sounds mental. It sounds like you've lost the plot. You've actually lost the plot. It's not sounding good, you know? There. That should be it back to me. I think I got unsubtremised channel. It's very plausible. I think it should be in my description. Right, we'll do five defense. We're almost level seven combat. Let's go. Oh my god, Serenity! How are you doing? How was your stream? Even though you'll probably be exhausted and the last thing you want to do is get a ton of heck in comments and be like, I'm not making a stream. I don't know. How, hopefully it was good though and you had fun. Hi Raiders! I'm Strony Cuttles from Veiler and I'm currently doing my stream snipe game of the day, of the week, sorry. We're playing old-school Rinscape. We're in World 3a, which is free to play and we're just leveling up our accounts a little bit because we are super weak and I'm scared to send us quests, because someone might fall down. What level is your attack? My attack is four. Strength is five and defense is one. I'm currently doing defense right now. Just to try and get overall combat level. Speedy Bun Raid. I never saw Rinscape before. Oh, it's basically an incremental game and you just click. Literally, this is the graphics. I'm not even kidding, check me out. I've got a gold plated chef's hat on. Gold apron on. You've not seen anything bear. Just amazing. It's a sweetie bun raid. Bun bun raid. Help, I've fallen. I'm literally dropped out. Why did I get a message? I'll be logged in in 30 minutes. But yeah, we're just leveling up because we want to do some questions. That's weird. I always saw the YouTube make up that's not the default graphics. Oh, at least even worse than this. Oh, it's been six hours already. I didn't realize either. Sorry for stealing all your time, guys. Time flies when you're having fun. Time flies. This is peak graphics. You do not get better than this. The year is 2024. Let's admire the daisies right here. Let's zoom in a little. Look at these, man. Beautiful. You can see every poly... What's that, a poly thing? Every triangle. Oh. All the triangles are made out. Oh, I've reached a total level of 100. Ooh, our accounts are getting bear. We've started on fresh accounts. So, all that got censored. It did. Hold on, let me eat a salmon. Well, we're at combat level 7. Oh, we are getting potent. Okay. Polygon, that's what I meant. Yeah, polygon. But if anyone looks as funny, I'm gonna get them. Level 7, go and get them. They can't handle. They can't handle it. Laracraft, honestly. Okay, think we're getting there, we're getting there. Maybe we do 5 on each. Eat combat means we can survive a little bit of a hit. A little bit of a punch, if you will. Triangle. Oh, that should have been... Is there a other name? Yeah, we tricked everything. Wow. And then wherever Ernie's chicken starts, I'm actually unsure. Wow, level 4. Did I put my combat? We're at 7.6 for combat. I like how it shows you the increment as well. To be like, you're getting closer. I'm pretty sure prayer counts to your overall combat level as well. So, I hit Fondle of Triangles. So, I don't know if we should do some... I've never done... Is it the altar? Dragon bone altar run, but they're so expensive. And I would need personal guards all the way over. See, that's the fastest way to level up prayer, I believe. But yeah. Watching Stronny and Emile and Spirits playing a game on my own almost feels like I have a friend. Isn't there no sensory overload doing that? I feel like I'd be like, I couldn't handle it. I feel like there's too much going on. Is Emi enjoying her game so far? I already need a P again. I feel like whenever I have a T, she's loving it, oh, I'm glad. That's what I like to hear. See, I knew a picture. Oh, I'm level 4 health. Sorry, 4 HP. I think there's everyone at least level... So we've got level 6 refling. Yeah, that's good. Okay, apparently we get level 5 in attack. We're getting leveled up. We've got level 10 refling over there. I can't tell. We've got level 6 as well. Yeah, we're getting a bit better. Getting a bit better. We're definitely not to be tripled with even though we're not level 10 combat yet. But we're not to be missed with. How do you pee so much yet so little? I know that caffeine makes you want to wee-wee all the time. So I think it might be because I'm having so much T's from my throat. Yay! We're like doing little mini tasks as well. Someone wants to trade. You wish to trade. I accept your trade. What do you wish to trade me? Oh, I don't know if I can wear this, actually. I don't know if it's too... strong. Like, I can't wear it yet. I trade absolutely nothing. Oh no, I took my apron off. Oh my god, I have to pick between drip or function. I think I have to pick between drip. I'm so sorry. Do you want your steel plate body back? Sorry, the drip is for life. For real, for real. The drip is for life. I mean, check this out. I mean, check it out. It's so good. Okay, sure. You want to trade with me? I swear if it's more poison. What is this? Crossbow? Oh! Whoa! Wait, a pink skirt? Are you dressing me up? I can't believe reeflings are dressing me up. First cosplay stream confirmed. Oh, look at the long drip. I said Tee-hee. I said Tee-hee, you're not getting Tee. I put little crossbow ball tips on. Whoa! Okay, okay. Wait, I think the skamar is better. What is it called? A steel skamar. Okay. I've got skamar. I'm not afraid to use it. Even in the game, she has a dumpy, honestly. The pencil dress. Yeah, I mean, look at that. Wow, look at them polygons. Oh yeah, it's all coming together. Great. We will start airing as the chicken, I think. Oh, there's an imp. If I pick up a bead, I'm pretty sure. Beat that imp up. Or I'll beat it up. Don't worry, I'll get it. I don't want, I don't want because the cave's in the way. Okay, now we beat the imp up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, beat him up. If he drops a colored bead, we can use it for the wizard quest. I just realized I never killed it, so I can't tell. We'll never know what it dropped. Oh wait, did it drop something? Oh, it did! Okay, we need it for the wizard tower quest, but completely forgotten, you need like four different components. What are the consequences of death in this game? I think you keep your three highest priced items or something like that. Right, the three reflings are, I'm going to stand at the gate, and I'll wait for everyone to come over. So if you want to stand outside the gate of the cow pen, we will go do Ernest the chicken next, and then we'll actually do some cooking again, because we're going to need a, if we're wanting to wrap it up in a month, I'm definitely going to need to stop getting so distracted. We'll do some cooking. Oh, the refling's out the pen. And then I'll walk again. Right, where the heck is Ernest the chicken? Uh, Starting off. Four quest points. Oh, that's the rewards. Able to survive a skeleton level 22 attacking you. Surely we're leveled up enough. Surely. Talk to Veronica outside of Draynor Manor. Blah, where is it? On the map. Draynor Manor. Draynor Village. Oh, it was like outside that creepy place. Yeah, here. Okay, okay. So how do we progress? We go across the bridge, and we go up, and then we just keep going along, and then we can go up again past the window. Okay. I shall take a breath and break. Don't get me. Oh, no. Wait. Okay. If you want to follow me, if you want to follow me refling, is there anyone who's left behind? You're not. I don't recognize you as a refling. There's a refling getting beaten up by a cow right now. But reflings come outside the pen, and you can follow me with a golden heart. I crafted the schemata and shielded myself. Heck yeah. Not all the reflings like watching this one refling be up a cow. I'm trying. Don't actually worry if I get stuck. I'll catch up. Who is this Shirley you keep talking about? It's me seeing Shirley. Okay, there. Refling. Is there any other refling? I don't know. Render distance isn't helping. I think that's just natural. Okay, let's... If you want to follow me, I have the golden heart. I'm going to be very careful with my pathing. Maybe you can follow me. Choo choo all aboard. I made it to level four. Wish me luck. We're getting there. We're getting there. We'll definitely maybe do a bit of combat training. But yeah. All aboard. I'll just kind of click one by one to make sure we don't get any actually stuck on something. How many reflings do we have in game? I don't actually know how many. We've had a few went offline because we have hit the six hour mark. But we do have a good amount of reflings all hanging out. We are going to do cooking though. I need to cook. Jesse. We need to cook. Refling. We need to cook. Okay, I'm following the bunny. Honestly, I should just follow the bunny. Right, we're just going to follow report. Follow. Wait, wasn't the bunny the one that gave me the poison? Why would I follow the bunny? Hope I can join in next time. Absolutely. Absolutely. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, scary. Oh, no! It doesn't go stuck. Oh, no, refling's there. I was an AFK refling. Okay. If you want to see where we are, we're in world three AA and we're outside the creepy, creepy drain or manner. Now, apparently we can get hurt in here. So if anyone doesn't have food, do you want to trade me and I'll share my food with you? If you send a trade offer, I'll give you some food because apparently we can get hurt. But I think we can run away. We just need to run away. That's all. I crashed. Time to head back in game. The forest is pretty scary. Okay, we got a light. Follow the bunny. Last time I did that, I found myself in Wonderland. Okay, this refling needs some food. Here you go. Is there another? Or has everyone got food? Did you all cook meat? I think you all must have cooked meat, yeah. Oh, there's fires to cook meat if you picked up meat from the coals. Only now I notice that the strange horse head refling that walks strangely is no more there. We are safe for now from the strange walking refling. We've got someone giving us a gluck gluck outside the gates. Been cooking the coos, right? Okay, I don't know what happens here. But I think the forest attacked... Oh, wait, wait! Sorry, sorry. The quest is out here. Talk to the lady here. Sorry, talk to the lady. Talk to the lady at the door. Can you please help me? I'm in a terrible spot of trouble. Start, Ernest, to chicken. Absolutely. Ah, sounds like a quest. I'll help. Yes, yes. I suppose is a quest. My fiancee Ernest and I came to this hoose. Seeing that we were a little lost, Ernest decided to go in and ask for directions. That was an hour ago. This house looks spooky. Can you see if you can find it for me? I'll see what I can do. Thank you, thank you. I'm very grateful. Okay, what are we? Did we go inside now? I'm scared. All right, open the large door. Oh, wait! Requirements for the quest. You need poison and fish food. Oh, no! Where do you get poison and fish food? For the other reflins. I thought you were being funny, other reflin. I didn't realize. Oh, wait, you're giving me something? Why are you giving me? Is that a boat plug? A holy symbol. What does it do? I wear it. It's like a star. Anyone need poison or fish food? Yeah, I thought that reflim was being funny, giving me poison fish food. Turns out it's actually for the quest. That Samsung Galaxy Slurp. My life can't handle another MMO being through four in my life. So this refling... So this refling will just keep chat company. We're only doing 99. I don't know how to get poison or fish food. There might be a refling that has enough supplies. I didn't realize. I never said. I'm crazy. Recommended items, none. Or can you get them in the house? There's a spawn for them, but they're very slow. Okay, at least we can spawn the items. In the house. Right, I'm gonna very quickly go for a pee. I don't know why I need to pee so much. I think I'll make a tea as well. Sorry, my voice is like really struggling. I really want to stream for long. I'm worried about how long I can last during my ASMR stream. A little tinkle break, yeah. A little tinkle-winkle. The poison's in the house near the kitchen. Okay, so at least we know the fish food and the thing he does respawn. I'm gonna make another tea. I'm so sorry about all the breaks today. It's my voice. I'm getting, I'm getting nervous. I'm not gonna be able to make it. But for the ASMR and the sweet trying stream, like, oh, sorry, I just stood on the mic. Sorry about that. I just absolutely obliterate your ears there. Don't apologize. I'll be back. I'll literally be in a minute, okay? To pee. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if it's a jumpscare when the tracking doesn't catch me coming into the room. And I just unmute and I'm like, oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. You died. Woman in the scar. Why is it so loud in the music menu? Thank goodness it doesn't link the details on the audio. I think we're in skating with it. Some people stream, what do you need? Right. an air nest. Chang. One refling went to go grab some spades for people who don't have one. Oh sugar, I don't have a spade either. Oh wait, what am I doing? No, this one. And then this one. Uh, okay. Are we waiting for spades? Trade for spade! Trade me! Trade mommy! Trade mommy! Mommy needs a spade! Just one, please. I did make another spade. I'm happy to say my pee was clear. Um, I don't think I can do endurance. My... My throat is very sore right now. It's very raw and it hurts, okay? I'm needing your ink to help me unironically soothe my throat. So I think what the deal is when Mercy goes live, which is in T-minus two and a half hours for snippets, we'll raid into her. If that's okay. Um, there's a spade inside as well. Just woke up. How's runes keep going? It's going good! Um, sadly my voice can't keep up. This is when I get really frustrated for streaming. I could happily stream 12 hours right now. But it really hurts. Okay, dropping some poison and fish food. Okay, we'll wait until it loads up. Honey, ink, tea, honestly. Mercy's in two hours, yeah. Oh good, been having tons of fun and it's already a long stream, don't feel bad, yeah. What do you mean? This is a baby stream for me? Are you joking me? Literally a two hour stream, which is like the average for a VTuber, is like a millisecond in my time. Like, oh, I feel so bad. I'm only going to stream eight hours today. Ah! I mean, what do you mean I got to play a multiplayer game with quite literally, like, how freaking blessed is it to be able to play a multiplayer game with Reeflings live whilst we're having a carry-on, just meme-ing about freaking doing head-banging, like, I've been dripped out, I've been getting gifts and stuff, people giving money, like, it's not a job! Like, this is fun! Like, I'm having so much fun! Ugh, I wish there was some sort of secret to, like, fixing, like, my voice from vocal strain, but the sad secret is it's literally just shut up, stop talking. Ugh, which is so annoying. Better to end early than strain your throat. I mean, it's already strained right now, but, uh... What do you mean, multiplayer-to-ever talk, yapping sessions, honestly, is just yap, yap, yap. We got a little spooky boy! Spooky, spooky, bump again! You're so misunderstood. Oh, did you like Emmy's cover? No. Mo! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Oh, it's in a mo! Oh, you're yawning just head off! Oh, that's hilarious. I'm waiting for the fish food to load, so the others can grab it, but I actually don't see it loading. Having so much fun just hanging out at the Reeflings, have all of the quests done already? No, the quests are not done, please don't worry, we're doing the free quest, Erin is the chicken at the moment. We've done a hand... Oh, I've got my BS forehead in the way, hold on, let me just close this for a second. Here is all the quests we've done, so free quests, we've done Cook's Assistant, we're doing Big Erin Ease, the chicken right now. We did the mystery, the restless ghost Romeo and Juliet, Sheepshearer, X marks the spot, we're finishing Erin is the chicken, and then we're going back to update, to grind on our cooking stats. Can't expect you to do constant endurance streams day after day, sadly I hate it, I don't like doing short streams, I just feel so like... I don't know what the word is, I have been yearning for this day, for an entire year, for this time, sorry, not for this day in particular, but for this time, and it's just like... It's frustrating that the only reason I can't stream more is because of my voice, and not because I'm tired, or I don't feel well, or I don't want to type thing, it's frustrating, it's my voice. That's it. That's the only reason I can't stream for long, because it hurts to talk right now. Jesus, you haven't seen the whole song! Try to live up to the name, you know? Maybe. I asked for a little bit off the top. Hey, yo, who's the barber? Man, we gotta go both. Okay, the poison isn't loading on the floor for me, but I think we'll do it, so as long as you guys have accepted the quest, we're gonna go inside now, reflings. It's taking nice and slow. I think the trees hit you on the way past, so just be careful you don't stray from the path too much. Assumers supposed to go... Ah, the tree frickin' went for me. Open large door. Okay. Oh, there's like haunted things. Where are we supposed to go? Get the gauge and tube. Where is that? And not here, maybe it's upstairs? Okay, we... I'm gonna wait until... Oh, that's not good. Wait, I'm just gonna check how the reflings made it in. Go up the stairs, reflings, when you come inside. Is that the last refling? Who's that? I think that's the last refling. We all need to go upstairs. How are you even there? The chair's attacking him! Oh my god, that chair being yours! Okay, that... Is there no refling there? Oh, I'll go up the stairs. Oh, he like... Oh, someone's beating them up. Wait, where are we supposed to go? Up here? Up these stairs to the left? As soon as we come up? Nothing's being highlighted for me. Runlight, you're failing me! Am I supposed to go here? Talk to the professor? Be careful, there's lots of things... Brian! It frustrates you because you can't control it and that's the most frustrating thing. Not being able to control something. That's right. Thank you, Iron Looper. For the tip. And yeah, just like... Runlight is telling you to use... Wait, hold on. Oh no, I'm messing up. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. That's not so easy. Well, look at them. Oh, maybe I should be reading that out. What would that say? Runlight is telling you to use your poison on your fish food. Okay. Okay, I have poison fish food. Wait, never mind. Just hypnotize yourself. Strongly trust me, I love you and enjoy every second, but your health is important. Yeah, like, as long as my voice doesn't break, then I'm good to go. In my pain. Where... Where is this freaking map telling me to go? I'm so confused. I wanna go. We were to go outside? Oh, right, okay. Oh, no, sorry. Close the map, not close. Right, so go downstairs. Okay, come downstairs. Poison the fish food and then come back out of the mansion. Okay. Oh, this is a rough one to do together, I think, so if you've not got... The door won't open. Over here. Okay, okay, okay. How do I get over there? Wait, open the door. The chair beating you up? Oh, no, they just run around. I thought the chair was like, beat you up in the game on my cheek. Oh, there's a rubber tube. I get it. Get the gauge in the tube. Oh, my God. Open the door. What's that? Oh, I'm actually kind of scared of that. Wait, I can't go in. The door's locked. Oh, right, okay. Someone's dropped a speed ahead if you need it, by the way. But we're taking the long way around. Okay, I'm glad the chairs don't beat you up because, honestly, death by chair is pretty embarrassing. Right, open the door. Or I'm gonna throw rocks through your window. Open the door. Okay, so one by one door, but we can add it. I need to get the key first. Well, she's a stubborn one, but I guess she keeps up till the day she can take care of herself to some fish so hard, man. Okay, okay, we're now outside. This is a very hard one to follow, quest-wise. Especially if you had a rune-like, rune-crafting guild. Stop. Are you telling someone that we're rune-crafting guilds? Okay, I'm just following the Easter bunny. Follow the bunny, the bunny, the bunny. Follow the Easter bunny. To east, to east, to east. Search compost heap. Heap. I love it. A bit of cheeky vandalism. Okay, we did it. Oh, what did I do? You find a small key. Okay. And now... Okay. Oh, there's a thing ahead. Okay, there's a fountain ahead. I don't know. Has that already come to you? I feel like... I feel like someone's probably stuck in the house right now. As long as you try and come outside, then you'll be fine. So as long as you've all got the key, come to the fountain next. There's a fountain through the trees. The trees might whip you, but you should survive. Like, it's literally one HP at least. Poisoned fish food on the fountain. Use on the fountain. Oh, the tree just made a noise. Use it on the fountain. Okay. The piranhas start eating the food, then dine float to the surface. And then search the fountain. There seems to be a pressure gauge in here, and a lot of dead fish. Well, yeah, you just roll them, smoke them. Come outside. Yes, I see, I see. Okay, once we've all stopped head banging into the fountain, then we go back into the house. Anyone got some spare poison fish? Ah, the poison was in the house, I think. Wait, we're outside the house. How do we get back in? Why is it making me go around in a circle? I'm spinning around. Get out of my way. I didn't think for how much time you prepared for this, by the way. How is it, is it like you expected? To me, you're having a lot of fun, but maybe you have more to see. On RuneScape? I'm getting whipped by a tree. Sorry, sorry, Ruflin's getting whipped by a tree because of me, sorry. I didn't mean RuneScape, it took a little second to get ready to stream out. I wasn't that bad. Scale it in time, you just have to run in and pick the tube, then run out. Make it in turns, who wants to go first? Ah, fuck it, I'll go first. I need a lead by example. Okay, grab the tube and then... Okay, I got whacked for two, so just make sure you get out in time. Would you prefer to be whipped by a tree? Is it instance, or are we going to have to wait for that to reload? Oh no, you've got it, you've got it. Okay, that's fine. Are you beating him up? He said nah, hold on, let me do this, Ruflin's like all this. He's going to skillspec him, he's going to skillspec he's going to do the little twirl thing. Oh, streaming in general has been absolutely fantastic. It's gone exactly the way I wanted it to. I love streams, Nathan, and I love long streams and yapping people's heads off and it's just gone absolutely amazing. Just fantastic. For me, I don't like the mega super professional streams, don't mind me. Some people really like it. Let's go, has everyone got it? Thank you, Ruflin, for killing the skelly boy. Has everyone got the rubber tube? I don't think everyone's got it. I don't know if it's been a bit funny, but you should be able to go in and get the rubber tube now that you've got the key. Oh, someone's getting attacked over there. Is there a Rufling? Oh, I thought a Ruflin just perished there. Ruflin just perished there. I'm happy to hear that, yeah. There is nothing like a professional stream. Where's the fish food? Upstairs is the fish food reefling, someone says. I'll wait here until the other reeflings are caught because it's not fair to skip ahead. I like when funny Scott women yank to me for hours. Simple as, nothing more. Now, people really enjoy professional streams from other people, which is great, but for me, I'm just like... It's the best I can say. Oh, we're getting two head bang. Yo, I'm starting to think this is getting... Hold on, oh no, I can't wait, wait, let me zoom up a bit. Let me take one more step for no particular reason at all. Okay, let me take one more step for no particular reason at all. Because it's absolutely no reason at all. We are literal children, this is terrible. That awful getting... Hey, hey, hey, hey, he dancing on it, he dancing on it, he doing the split on it. I love your silly yapping. Oh my God, a ghost is going for it. Is there a refling on the outskirts? Oh, I think I'm too far away to be able to see if someone's at the compost heap right now. Oh no, someone's getting beaten up. Oh no, it's not him though. I have salmon if you want it, a refling that's literally protecting us all. There's salmon juice, whoa, what is that? Oh, is that for me? Wait, should I do this in the middle? I don't know what he does. Scottlefish, are you there? Should I do it or no? I don't know if the old man's got a good quest or not. Did I talk to him? Do it, okay, someone says do it. Oh, there you are, I hoped you would talk to me. I get so lonely, I have a present, I must get going now. Oh! Oh, he just gave me an uncut emerald. I didn't even ask anything. I didn't even ask anything. Oh, don't mind if I do, I thought he was going to like whisk me away. But he didn't. Oh, I see the poison. Whoa, poison's like 700. Well, I know where the poison is, if I don't need to know, it's by the left. As you come in. Does he need help? Wow. You wish to trade with me, what do you wish to trade? Oh, you're giving it, oh, the diamonds, how you call them. I don't know, the rocks in the ground. What are these called? It's not jewelry. But they're rocks. What are diamonds category? What are the category of ruby and plafa and that? Gemstones! Oh my god, I forgot that word there. Jeez, low waist. I literally forgot the word gems there. I apologize. Watch ads showed up tipped and left. Or, yeah, or in gems. I got out. Oh god, we're all headbanging. Are you practicing later? For when the next 10 audios come out? Wait, where is it? Headbanging? Headbanging. Oh my god, we really are a call. Clearly, look at us go. Oh, do you need, you need help, holy crap you need help right now. I've got salmon. This should heal you up. Go, go, go. Is there any reeflings? Oh no, they're self healing. Is there any reeflings on the outskirts? I can't really tell. I don't want to go ahead in case there's someone outside doing that. Fountain, but, um... Is everyone here? Did we make it? If there's a roofling, oh. Who did that? Who did that? That was you? Okay, we're reporting you for harassment. Interesting, we're in sync for me, but on stream. My ping is really high to everyone. They've had plenty of time. Yeah, is everyone here? I think so. Hi hi, how's stream going? It's been going amazing. Look at me and the roofling gang, we're doing questing. Okay, I think everyone's got the plastic tube. They get the gauge and tube. Get the oil can next. So, open this door. We'll go through. Okay. I think we're all ready. Okay. Don't have the tube, but also got the gauge. Wait, you don't have the tube? No, I do have the tube. Okay, we need to interact with this blue thing over here. Wait, you've not got the tube? Who's not got the tube? Tube, you just run in and pick up when it spawns. Go in the closet and get the rubber if you don't have... I shouldn't have said that. Oh my god, the shadow band GB's Twitter. All of our Twitter's looks like a shadow band, it's ridiculous. Like how sensitive it is. Oh, what's that? It's a big thing. Oh, it's gone. Did they get the tube? Did you get the tube? I think so. All right, fun part of the quest. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, the door... The door's fine. Hold on, sorry, I probably just closed that door on you. Okay, search the bookcase. Search the bookcase. Oh, is that one by one? Maybe a one by one moment. Hold on. Hey, let's go. Okay, go down the ladder. Wait, go down the ladder when you're ready. Is that everyone? Yeah, that's everyone. Once you get through the bookshelf. Okay, we did it. The whole gang's here. No replaying left behind. Oh my god, we're beating up the rats, literally. Oh god, what do we do? Okay, there's a lever on the wall. Pull lever alpha on the wall over here. I assume this is going to be instanced to us. So... I don't know. Then pull lever, bravo. Oh, the music's all like... Okay. Now this gate is a jar. And English, if it's like slightly open, it's a jar. Pull lever D. Oh, I'll pull the D lever all day long. Come over here, weak one. What did that do? Okay. Oh god, it's a one by one gate. Why is there a biggest issue right now? One by one gate. Oil can has a slow respawn as well. I need an oil... I think we all need an oil can. So we're just going to have to go for it and be patient. I'm sure you can wait. I don't know if all the levers are the same for everyone. It looks like you guys are going different ways. So I think it might be different. World hop when you get into the room and then hop back. Yeah, you guys are really going different ways for me. So I think it's different for everyone. Oh, the classic one by one gate. It's over. Lever solution is the same for everyone. How's everyone going... Are you guys... Do you see this one? That way everyone can grab it faster. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, I love this runelight plugin because if I had to do this by my brain, it would be over. This is crazy. All levers are unique in their own way. Exactly. Wow. Let's see. Pull this lever. We're almost done. Okay, I was going to say that's like a lot of fricking questions. Oh wait, sorry. I'm going to see if my tea is at an acceptable temperature if I'm going to scold myself on it. That's why there's one or the other. That was... All these doors. Oh, right. Am I taking it? And then you guys are world hopping? And then you're coming back to this world? Yeah, this track is... Gen 2 based after old school runescape tracks question mark. Oh wait, I should be facing you today. Honestly, I wouldn't mind that. I'm kind of down for that. I was actually thinking of Legend of Zelda Minish Cap but brought to kind of modern standards for Gen 2. Runescape OSD? If we had like a mischievous little brat thing, this song was kind of like not Circus S. I guess it was Circus S. Does everyone have an oil can? Or... Oh, there's a respawn. That took a whole second. Everyone got an oil can? Maybe I know you're taking that now. Okay, if you have an oil can, go back out to the center over here. If you don't have an oil can, wait for it to spawn in that room or you can do what's called world hopping where you purposely swap to a new world and it should be like a new instance. But if you have an oil can, you're allowed to come out here. Minish is 20 years old now. Stubious brat. I would watch Zelda. I will uncontroll. I just want to support whoever gets sea shanty. No, it has to be like hidden, but when you know what it is, you know. Oh, there's a reefling there. We're not ready yet. I'll just check if anyone's back here. Other than that reefling. Oh, there's one there. I was just straight up reefling. You actually got the name reefling. I'm surprised no one else took it. I guess we'll just beat out... We're gonna beat up rats out here. Okay, we're just gonna get our combat level a bit higher. Oh, I just leveled up. What did I get? I got a taxix. Oh, there's spiders as well. Yeah, let's just level up her combat a little bit. Why not? Woo. Us following her gives me Ugandan knuckles flashbacks. This beat only fake queen. Would you hum shanty? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, I managed to get the reefling name still five hours a day. Yeah. That's sea shanty. We're just leveling up her combat. Hmm. There's still a reefling over there getting absolutely... What are you getting annihilated by? A rat? Oh, okay, that's fine. And there's one there. There's a third? Yeah, we've got Hatsumiku chilling over there. Hmm. Hmm. Reefling. Now we have a max roll. Hmm. Let's get some level up. No way that rat just dunked my shield. I went bonk. Yeah, Amy would have chosen... Maybe. She would show us maybe. I remember that meme went like absolutely viral. Someone said that was the start of the brain rot meta when it comes to memes. Which I found rather unsafe. Wow. I think there's someone else that's fighting that. Here we go. We've almost got all over cans. And then we'll level up on fishy. I keep saying fishin'. It's not fishin', we're doing kootin'. My PCs fan just started up. I get nervous when my PCs... I'm like, what's wrong? What's wrong? Oh? Last reefling that needs to can? The question mark? I don't see anyone else doing the levers. Am I going crazy or are we clear? Have we did it? Are we ready to move on? Oh, he's done it. I don't want to say dancing. Okay, if everyone's got a can, up the ladders, please. Little reeflings, if everyone's got a can. Oh wait, no! Sorry, there's one more. I think they're still doing the lever stage. I'm sorry, reefling such a badger. You can come back down and we'll keep killing the means. He's going to be absolutely beaten up by that rat, so he'll help you out. There you go. Uh... Did you get it? I don't know. Did you get it? You're moving around erratically as a reefling... I don't know, are you stuck on the levers? You're not taping. Go on, I'll catch up. Are you sure, reeflings? I won't feel anyone feel left out. VR chat was well, and that's just a bit weird. I was going to have to play VR chat to learn how the 3D models work. I have no idea how that 3D model streaming works. But I don't know if you can use other programs as well. Oh, I'm leveling combat, not to brag. You will learn. Can you say error again? Error? Error. Error, switching tracks. You don't need to use VR chat for 3D models. I honestly don't know anything about it. The girls want 3D models, and I'll pay for it. That's pretty much all I know about 3D models. I'm like, joking. If they want 3D models, they'll get it. VR chat isn't interesting at all. Oh! I've saw VR ASMR videos. I thought that was pretty cool. And plus, it would be cool to see the height difference of the girls as well. Go on, y'all. Okay, okay. We're being sent away by the reflying, right? Upstairs, everyone. We're being sent away. Upstairs. Okay, there's a lever here. Pull the lever, crunk! Oh! Okay, okay, okay. Right, we need to go up the stairs again. Right, let's go back here. I'mma sip my tea. Okay. You literally talk like a real mummy with the girls. They want 3D models. Yeah, I'll just pay for it, darlin'. There you go, darlin'. All yours. I don't know what it's about, but you just enjoy yourself. It's true. They'll be like, I want this. I'm like, oh, you just, oh, you get it. You just enjoy yourself, hen. Right, okay. Talk to the professor at the top of the stairs. Oh, you found anything yet? I have everything. Give them to me here, then. All his. Oh, you put them. Noises are being made? He's a man! Thank you, madame. I was dreadfully irritating being a chicken. How can I ever thank you? Well, a cash reward is always nice. Of course, of course! You're awarded 4 quest points of 300 coins. Yay! That was really quick. Other than, like, the horrific issues. That was like a really quick quest. Um... Right, we're not doing any more questing. We're leveling up. Next. Money, let's go! What is this pressure gauge? Don't touch it. It's going to explode. What do we do? What pressure gauge? It's really like any other scientific thing. I guess that's it, and we just leave. But that... It's in the fountain. It's in the fountain. That's why you need to poison it. How bizarre. Oh, there's the fish food. Ugh! I guess that's it. We're already freaking done this quest. Hold on. Wah. Oh wait, why did you not let me out that door? Open large door. Wait, why does it make me turn backwards? I keep... It doesn't let me out this door? Open large door. It won't open. Front door is one way. Oh, so we have to go all the way around again? Oh, okay. Another interesting take from the dev team? Alright, let me sip into my tea. Okay, yeah. I'll go another one by one door. It's over. The chair's chasing me. Can you even go that way? Can you even go that way? Oh, you can. You can come around this side? Can you teach me? Why to play Rensuke Tempah? Get ready. Go right back. Ow! The tree! I don't want to go in a fight. Move! What's going on? Why can't I move? Hello? Am I missing? Why can't I not... Why? That tree literally had me in a death grip. Oh my gosh. Mostly was a... a guy of fun. Don't get skill checked by a tree. Literally, one error. I almost died there. I think the tree liked you, honestly. Okay, we made it. But I don't think that's all the reeflings. This is dangerous, literally. Oh, there's a reefling there. Right, we'll wait until a cool army. I have an army of reeflings requesting, but we're about to go level up our cooking next. I'm trying to finish my honey tea before it gets cold. Wah! Okay. Um, next thing we're going to do is we're going to travel north. We're going to take a west and then north and we're going to be outside the village. But we need to go get fish and rods and stuff. I don't think there's a fish shop nearby. So I think we're going to go to the Grand Exchange and buy fish and rods. Army, definitely not cold. Yeah. This music has given me a fatal dose of nostalgia. Passed so much since the last Get Rektor is. Hmm. As I get stuck I'm ruffling fans and bye. I've never gotten a runescape. It's like either you got into it or you didn't. Right, I think that's everyone. Hopefully, question mark. As we head banger way of victory. I don't know about the other reefling that got stuck and sent us forward but thank you for not holding us back. By the same time I feel bad because it's like the whole point of this is to the question and stuff together. Right, let's get in the nicer parts of the channel. Let the evil at bay type of thing go away. Wait, let me finish my tea. Either you got into it and you're still playing this day or you didn't. I got into Guild Wars instead. I never played Guild Wars. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Trying to finish this. Ah. Oh, I thought it gave us feathers but it didn't. I was just an image of a feather because we need feathers to do fishing. Hmm. Hmm. I was so into it and was so shy that in taping class I'd want big letters, RuneScape rules and wait for someone to see it and ask me if I played. Aww, that's such a shame. Feathers, we need feathers. Birds of a feather. Right, we're gonna take a left and go... Oh wait, no. Do we need to go to Port Sarim? I think we actually need to go to the fishing shop to buy our rod and feathers. The fishing shops are west and south so we'll go west and south. Just follow me with my golden stuff. Oh no, I'm gonna follow the rabbit. We follow the rabbit. You coming? Refling? Yes. Uh... Take us westward and then south on the main road. Feathers. Oh no, am I saying feathers? Oh, we need some feathers. Wait, how did you say feathers? Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Oh, it sounds like I'm kind of saying father. I guess. Feathers. Your father. In this line you also say your father, isn't it? And it's like, ah, that's my dad. I don't want change. I never played Guild Wars Organscape. I want silly Scottish women! Feathers. Your wee feathers. You'd weave it behind, Refling. You'd put your wee running boots on. You'd put your... Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Feathers. Oh, we're gonna do a brawl. Uh... at the end of the stream We're going to hop over the wall and fist fight each other and I'm going to get a rose and I'll give it to whoever wins the 50 cups. Oh, pardon me, I'm broken. Ok, in this shop you will need to buy a rod. Most of you already have one. Ah, you guys so fast. So trade with Garrett and then buy... oh no, there's only one. That costs five coin, so buy one. Do we need feathers or do we need the fishing bait? Is it a fishing bait we need? I made this tea so honey. Oh that's sweet, that's too sweet. I can actually finish that. All the sweetness is at the bottom. Feathers for trout and salmon. Is that ticking up? Oh it is. I don't have the money. Or maybe I do. Ok, that's all I can buy with what I've got. I haven't got enough for anything else. I've got 73 feathers, I didn't think this far ahead. I opened a stream and didn't see you here. I wish this to trade with you, except trade. Eh, I still have a key. Oh, that's going to be a lot of feathers to spread about, not going to lie. How do you have so much money? Right, let me buy feathers for... what are these? Feather pack? What's that? I don't know. If I buy fifth... oh you can. Oh, that's so smart! Inside the feather pack. I'm going to keep some heels on me. Right, I can give feather packs to reeflings. Why does that not buy when I click it? Wait, I'm dropping them! Oh, hold on, I'm being dumb. I can trade the feather packs. Ok, I've got like a thousand feathers now. Who needs feathers? I think everyone needs feathers, honestly. If you need feathers, trade me and I'll give you... wait, actually. I should like give 200 feathers each? I'll just say buy 50 and then I'll give 200 feathers. I love spreading feathers on my... Should we get a harpy? We should totally get a harpy. I'm glad to take a feather pack. Ok, trade me if you need feathers. I'll try and give you like 200. Whose outfit is that? Is that even a reefling? Are you a reefling? I don't know. I think that might just be someone caught in the crossfire. Right, let's see. Accept and then offer... 200 and then we'll go fishing. Accept. Wait, what? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, why did that not work? 200 and I... Yeah. Oh, jeez. Sorry. I don't know where that went. It just disappeared into space. Ok, there's 200 for you and then there's two... How dare you? Just trying to see. And then 200 for you. And then sugar mummy. You say that as if a reefling didn't just hand me all of his paycheck and runescape. Where's Johnny at now? We're at Port Sarim. We're on World 380. We're currently at Port Sarim buying... Ok, my PC just sped up trying to zoom that in. And then we're going to go up to Barbarian Village to get salmon because there's a permanent fire there. And we'll do 200. No, I've done it again. Sorry. I keep teasing you with a feather. I've done it again! I can't stop teasing you right now. I'm tickling you with the feathers. I'm like, oh, do you want the feather and like tickle you and then run away with it? Like pushing it against your face like ASMR and then like... You need feathers too. I'll buy a ton as well so when we head over there, we should be fine. So if you need more, I can always get like always just trade more. Teasing us with a feather, honestly. Thank you, pretty lady. Played with me. Has everyone got what they... Where the heck is the guy? Where's the NPC to buy, awful? I can't see. There's too many of us. It's Miss. He's not for me. Alright, where's the guy to buy freaking things off? Oh, there he is. Gonna buy like a bunch of feather packs and open them up. Oh my god, have I already spent 10k on feathers? Jeez, this game is not cheap. The economy's in shambles. Right, that's like literally almost 5k. That's more than enough. Does anyone else... You need some too. Does that work? It did work, thank goodness. How did you know that our weaknesses are feathers? Stop using your powers on us. I don't think I ever thought of feathers. Did I do a tickling? I may have got... I don't think I got... No, I think I got you tickling me artwork. You're welcome. Does anyone else need any feathers? Or are we all ready to go? We need to thank Sugar Daddy, Weflin... The one that gave me poison that I thought was being bred. I realised and I was like, I didn't accept the quest and had to loop with the chick. Oh no, sorry, did you manage? I could take some please. Trade. And then offer X amount. Alright, has everyone got a rod? Not the one that's already attached to you. One bought from the thing. Were you giggling? Were you Sugar Daddy, Weflin and... Giggling? Kill... What's... What's heavier? Kilograms. Right, is everyone ready to do the walk? The walk. Yes, I finished it. Oh no, you need some... Hold up. Except trade. We're getting there, we're getting there. Wait, no, I don't... No, I don't need your rod. Stop, I don't need your rod. You keep your rod to yourself, Weflin. It's not the time for that. I do have a rod for vision. Now I need some feathers, thanks. Sugar would catch up me. Right, is everyone ready to follow me and I'll take us to Barbarian? You need a fly fishing rod for the fishes. Oh, we need a specific type of rod. Of course we do. What rod of alcohol? I've got a fishing rod. I need a fly rod. Hold on, trade Garrett. Fly fishing rod. Right, does everyone have a fly fishing rod? Before we move on to the next location. Lesson two hour warning for Mercy Modest. Nope. Do you need... Me... To... Oh. I hope it restokes. You're out. I do have a pretty fly rod. Pretty fly for a white guy. You know it's kinda hard just to get along today. He asked for... What's that? He asked for ink. He asked for a 13 year. Instead they drew a fairy one. It's a fairy one. I don't know... They're not restocking. They're like so slow to restock. I don't know if I can... Wait, we are... We're gonna be right next to the grand exchange. Maybe I'll buy some off the grand exchange. I'll go with the grand exchange. Yeah, okay. We're gonna make it to the grand exchange. Don't worry. If you don't have a fly freshen rod, we're gonna be very close to the grand exchange. So don't worry. You can follow me. Follow Golden... Golden me. Is there any more reasons in that shop? I actually can't tell. The camera is like... I'm sure there's a way to turn off first. But... Right, we'll follow... Our... Gated... Our gate, our bunny gate. A little hopsy. I hope I'm right. Yeah, okay. This is in the... The shop. Everyone's here. We're going to go to the grand exchange to make sure everyone has a fly freshen rod and to also deposit all of our items because our inventory's getting like pretty full of stuff. And I don't want to be walking around with like so much money. Oh, there's the brawl. This is where we're gonna do a bar brawl. In a bar. Da-da-da-da-da... Do-a-da-da-da... Yay, bye! Ba-kuh-ba-kuh-ba-inter bolt... Ah! You can always hover over and then just say follow. Follow... Follow the leader, leader. Oh, no, someone got stopped by a mysterious old man. Oh, you should always talk to the mysterious old man he'll give you, um... Gemstone! An uncut gemstone. Put James in. Okay, we're all ready. Follow the leader leader. Our ink shall block the sun. I have 10 strongies. I got some there already. Okay, okay, okay. Always talk to the mysterious old man, Godot. Isn't that in... Sometimes he gives you a maze to run through. Oh. The series old man giving uncut things. Say yo. The old man can offer to send you to solve a maze and that one gives amazing rewards. Okay, okay. I know the signage lady doesn't give you anything good. I'm like 99% sure she gives you a bit of cabbage or something. I like this spinning one. I can't remember what it is. It's like the item spins around and you have to identify it or something. Amazing rewards. Love that maze quest. Love it. Oh, it's going to skeal him. No, it's not getting him. Oh, I'm not too... Two songs. It's terrible. It's absolutely terrible. Oh, no. Our biggest enemy, a bridge. Right, we're going to go to the Grand Exchange to empty our inventory so we only have feathers and a fly fishing rod. I don't... There's a few fishers. I don't know if they're bots or not. As long as they're not talking, then I think we'll be safe. Because I don't want to turn off public traffic. Because I don't want to turn off public chat because it's fun having you guys talk both in-game and in-stream. It's where the real fishing begins. The seventh grade computer lab day fishing. Is it terrible? No one is going to argue she wasn't that one. Right, we're back at the Grand Exchange. Right, where's the reefling that has the rods we desire? For those reeflings who don't have a rod, please... Reach out to... To me. To Kamin 1000. If you don't have a rod... I don't know where Kamin is. I can't... Oh, there, here, here. There. The one in the smithing cape. If you don't have a fly fishing rod, trade then. I'm going to put my stuff in the bank. Uh, but... Uh, this is not enough. Let's just put everything in here other than... Like, all of these? Keep that... Wait, why have I not got the money? Oh no, I have a bear shield, that's why. And then put that away. And then put the fishing rod away. And then put the money away. Oh no, I didn't mean to click that. Okay. Okay, we did it. We're ready to fish and cook. Apparently everyone has a rod. Jeez. It must a... A rod? A fishing rod. It's the mighty of the strange. Old women in the forest isn't for... Oh, there's so many strange requests. Uh, I guess we're ready to take off if everyone's emptied their inventory and you should have a rod and feathers and then we are going to go fishing and level up our cooking eggs financially. I'm ready. All aboard the golden apron train. I'll just make sure in case someone's stuck at the bank right now. It's kind of hard to tell, because there's, like, somebody... Oh no, there's only... Rods are ready, everyone. So few female reeflings. And... It is what it is. Oh, wishes to trade with you? Okay. What's up? Are you giving me your... Are you giving me your banana? Oh, yeah. Wait, is this a thing? No, it's not. Okay. I've just been given the banana. Did you just finish? Be honest. Oh, I ate it. I'm sorry. I just ate it right in front of you. I'm sorry. I just ate your banana. Wait, is that everyone? Can I store it somewhere or just drop stuff off? Oh, yeah. So, do you see over here how it says bank banker? And then click on your inventory and it'll put it in the bank. So, this empties out your inventory. The only thing you want right now is a fly fishing rod and feathers. Banana or banana? It's a treat all over again. I actually had a lot of fun making that to me. I don't know what it's... I don't know if it's gotten more popular or not. But when I woke up, it was, like, 1,000 likes and I'm like, ooh, that's a lot, I mean. Okay, that should hopefully be it. And then we'll take all the reeflings away. Actually, we'll... Well, I don't know if all the reeflings are ready yet. Thank you, God. She just ate that man's banana live on public. On stream in public in front of everyone. Okay, is that all reeflings? I like my name so... Oh, no, one more, one more. There's one more reefling. Look at that fit. Look at the feet size difference. Okay, we now follow the reeflings I thought was making a threat via the poison in fishfish. That video was good. Okay, reeflings, we're going to Barbarian Village. Hopefully there's no bots talking. I'm probably just gonna click ignore if there's any bots so we don't have to world hop because this is a pretty quiet world in general. Yeah, it was great. I lost that video. Really? I was, like, wondering should I, like, overcomplement... overcomplicate it and, like, say, like, certain words, phrase or whatever. And I was, like, no. Just be super simple about it. So I was... Did it. Right. Okay, so this is Barbarian fishing section. It's normally bought it, but I don't know. These may be real people. This is the best, like, free-to-play area. We'll do here. We'll lure our fishing rod. And how are you a cow? You were a bunny a second ago. Oh, I've already caught a fish. Whoa, the fishing is so fast. Oh, my God, really gonna be levelling up so quickly. Well, once whatever you catch, there's a pair of my fire over here that we can cook on. Everyone did get level 20 fishing, right? Or I've just dragged you over here for nothing. I hope everyone's... Oh, you're all up to 20? Oh, no, I thought everyone was 20 fishing. I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm not level 20. No. My suggestion, if you're not level 20, you need to get that net and go back to the thing. I joined late. I'll level in dreams night later. Not me, but I'll jump over and get a quick view of it. Oh, no, there's a banana on the floor. Random banana. So, only that video in your altar is one of the hottest. Oh. How many likes is that? I'm allowed to know. If you aren't level 20, I would suggest going back to Lumbridge. Teleport to Lumbridge. Get your small fishing net out the bank at the top and then go back to that spot until you're 20. And then coming here... Well, I'm already level 21. Jesus, so much faster doing this. It's crazy. Is that 1.4? Okay, we'll go. How long has people enjoyed it? That's the main thing. What level to bait fish here? I'm not sure. I only brought feathers for fly fish. No comment. Should I do a burp at the end of one of them? Maybe I should. They're like a burp version. Hmm. But yes. We're probably going to be here for like a hot second. Mercy's going up in an hour 40. So honestly, I think for the rest of the stream, we're going to be here. So if you want to level up to 20 cooking, you certainly can. Sorry, 20 fishing. And then like come back here. Like we'll probably most likely be here. And hopefully I can stop burning fish and then I can start burning through the supplies that were gifted because like I think I got like 2000 fish gifted to me. I'll be back. Good luck. Yeah. Have a good time. You can teleport via your magic spells. Get on to, yeah. Get to Lumberge again and do that small thing and then come back here once you've got your fly fishing rod. And I've got loads of feathers on me. Yeah. This is where the ground begins. We are currently at 25 cooking. Which is decent. I wanted to get 40 before stream. I think 40 is part of that cow animation. I think 40 is 40 realistic before Mercy goes live. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Bait fishing is 25. Oh, that's even worse. How do you get grapes, actually? From the Grand Exchange? I don't actually know where you harvest them. Tea time. We're actually going to get decent level in fishing. Yeah. Whoa. It's 50 eggs per fish. That's quite a lot. All things considered. I'm going to level up in fishing again on this one stalk of inland water. Yeah. Oh, that's a lot of trout on the floor. That's literally 10k worth of fish. 13k XP per hour. If you don't cook the fish. Yeah, we're going to have to stop and use this fire. But this is a permanent fire that we can utilize for ourselves. Which is fantastic. Would it make sense to just buy them in bulk? Yeah, especially if you do that route and just buy 66. Oh, that would be daunting. But it's definitely a possibility. I'm wondering, maybe we could do react andy content. I don't know if there's stuff that's safe for YouTube reaction. Whilst we do this. Because don't get me wrong. I'm entertaining. But I don't think I'm that entertaining for like a 30 hour grind. If I was doing grapes. Oh, just do the last one. So maybe we put stuff on in the background. 70 eggs pee for cooking trout. Whoa. That's so fast. We're literally 26 already. That is so fast. We need Minecraft parkour. Subway surfers in the bottom stream. 70 is so much. When we unlock salmon, I don't even know how much salmon is. XP wise. Oh, stop burning it. Stop burning it. Oh. Just put some surfers in the corner. Yeah, so this is like free grinding as well. To pick up this fish that people drop. Oh, we literally went on two cooking levels doing one batch of fish. That's crazy. I'm so fast. Here, fishy fishy. We need to be quiet. Salmon or 90 cooking eggs pee. Okay, that will be good. I'll listen to you whenever, but I've lost my mind entirely. See you tomorrow. Rest well. Please rest well. Gotta get up tomorrow with Khan. Oh, fun time. Oh my god, it's Rinscape in real life. It's trying to get easily watched. There has been nothing but yapping. It's because of my voice. It's so sore. My face meant no dragon. Harpoon specking on free world. Oof. Wow, wow, wow. I haven't seen it for a while. Honestly, we... We thought we were going to do 40 before Mercy comes on, but we managed to like fish to high heaven. We might be past 40. I don't know. I don't want to jinx it, but... 40 on the first Rinscape stream seems pretty decent work. And we also did fun questing. We got how many quests? One, two... I'm gonna go so fast. One, two... Three, four, five... Six and seven. Well, maybe do... A few more. 23! Got overtime tomorrow, so I'm gonna have to... So I have plenty of listening time. For anyone that needs to go to sleep or you need to go do some things, please do not worry. You're not missing out on much. This is literally the gameplay for the next hour and a half. I'm not even kidding. We're just fishing and then a... We're catching the fish and then cooking them and then leveling up cooking. Are you squidding me right now? Brian! Hi Tiny Spinny! Hope you had fun at work. We are currently in World 3A and we are in Barbarian Village. We're fishing. So the Grand Exchange, Varrock, Telopore, and we're at the fishing village. We have a fly fishing rod and we have a feather and we're catching the fish and cooking them on the perma... cookie thing. Once I'm experienced enough not to burn fish, I most likely will cook all the fish that the reeflings gave me because I don't want them to go to waste because that was a lot of money that the reeflings handed me. I don't... I'll cook all of that and see where we are. I think lobsters... I've got quite a few lobsters. Trout, salmon, all of that. So we're going to cook all of that. I don't think we're going to be on Wains by the time Mercy comes on. I think tomorrow's my eighth more stream. So I definitely need to try and rest my voice so that it's going to be so smooth. I'm ready for another 2AM YAP session. We're listening to the Scottish last. I've got plenty of YAP and we're like, I'm slow. Oh, someone's got a mini... mini quest. A toot! A toot free power. A toot free power. Such a tent feeling free. Oh my God, it's so intense. Wait, I'm not even fishing anyone. That's probably the only thing that kills me about this game, like when it comes to fishing and stuff. It's when the boxes move. But it is very tempting to, like, pick up all the fish that are already here and just do that and spawn that. Lobsters require 40 cookies so it might be a while. I don't want to burn them. Here we are going to 4AM. I'm ready for... Yes, so if you want to join in some say hi. World 380 and Barbarian Village Fishing Sport. Free to play. Free to play. Well, cheeky free to play. If I get the RuneScape... If I do end up getting the Cookin' Cape, we might take a break but I wouldn't mind doing membership quests at some point because I've never actually done them and I'm too scared to do them on my own but if you guys are with me, I'm not scared. Yes, I think tomorrow's ASMR stream and then day after is trying sweet. And then after is Skyrim and I get to rant... No, not rant, sorry. I get to mumble away about Skyrim for ages. Lobsters have a 60% chance to burn at level 40. Yeah, I'm not wasting Lobsters there. That is rough. That's rough. I don't want to waste a lot of weight because that was so much better rather than... But we're like leveling up our fishing so easily. Right, we are full. Let's see, can we get two levels out of this if we don't burn them? It burns the first one. Dude, waterfall fires. It gets you to combat level 30. What? Really? I know I got some quests really give you a lot of XP but I can't wait for those more but I'm lucky for the time. Maybe I'll cast a bit later. Don't worry if you can't make it to any stream. I think the boss will stay up and I'm not going to be doing ear licking because something weird is going on with YouTube. It's going on a little weird with YouTube and I don't know what's going on so I'm not risking it. As I gave you all those lobs you can burn them if you need to. I'd rather not waste the XP like if it was potential full XP like it's okay to burn these trout for example. Oh come on, one more and I'll level up. Okay, there we go. 20. Aw yeah. I want 40 before Mercy comes online. We're under the cock roof limbs. We're under the cock. Empty inventory. Let's get it. I don't know if I should fish or if I should honestly just put my stuff away and pick up but if everyone was picking up what was put on the floor then we wouldn't have enough trout to go around. Where would be the first ASMR? Hopefully YouTube will get off. No, it's like cracking down everywhere on anime ASMR in particular. If you want to call it anime ASMR. It'll be faster to loot the fish if you just want to do a cooking. That's what I'm thinking. If I just do that instead. It's nice to get the level of XP but I'm gonna like blast the head of you reeflings if I do that. Would you guys be upset if I picked up trout? Hopefully not. It would blast me forward though. Like, compared to everyone's level. Go for it. What do I need? I just need trout. I can't cook salmon because I'm too low level. Wait, examine? No, I don't want salmon. I can't cook it. I want trout. Right. We'll see how far this gets me ahead if I do this method where I don't fish. Maybe you guys can drop the fish for me and we get fish train going. There's two more. Right, let's cook this batch. Let's see what happens. I like fish. The fish are so amazing too. Basically, if you can't see what they're actually doing they're assuming it's like, Yes, I think that's what the problem is. Why? In real life it's fine, but anime's getting wapped with it. I say anime, beach over animation. You know what I mean. Anyway, it starts blasting. We're fish slaves, let's go. Sounds a bit fishy, but okay. Are we gonna make it? I think we are. I said this. No idea when I said that. 29 already? Oh my god, this is so fast. I'm saying it's fast now because it's gonna be so slow later, but I'm happy. I only burnt four from that batch as well. That trout is getting cooked to perfection by me, honestly. I see trout, I see trout. I don't know, those are cooked trout. Right, I'm gonna have to fish and go fish. Oh wait, someone wants to trade with me, hold on. You'll never guess what. It's trout. Oh no, you cancelled. Oh, you don't have enough inspiratory space. Oh no, sorry. I don't know how many I've got left. Like, space for freaking... Yeah. Trade modified. Blink, blink, blink. I saw serious, literally. I don't know if that's too much. Oh no. Is it? Oh, you failed me. Oh, my inventory. You failed my inventory. Thank you, beef knife. That's terrible. But thank you very much, we've blown. It's running out of here playing cooking, mummy. Literally, I'm feeding. You don't get 100% success on trout until 49. That's so rough. I don't remember it being so like that. We're already gonna level up again. I don't know when we unlock being able to cook salmon, but it's gonna be soon. Gonna drop all the trout in the south spot of salmon here. Yeah. If you don't overlap on the salmon, it makes it so easy to pick up. Wow, we're already up there. Oh my god. Are we gonna be 50 by the time mercy? We may, honestly. I'm cooking by gas. I'm cooking the best I can. Okay, we had like way more burnt in that batch, so it really is just randomized. Let's empty our inventory, and then let's grab all these trout. I'm over there, hating. Oh wait, sorry. I don't know if you have to take into account how much inventory space I have. Okay. Yeah. As long as you put whatever inventory. Oh my god. Loves yourself six percent. The key to power leveling is slave teamwork. Honestly, we're doing pretty good. We're already launching the 30s. I think we can fly past the 40s, honestly. Hi, Stronia. Been away from us today. How's it going? We have done some quests, some free play quests. We are currently at Barbarian Village, and I'm currently using the reflames to slave fish for me, so we're getting trout, and I'm currently leveling up like crazy right now. Every batch of trout is making me go up another level. I'm already 31 cooking. We're messing around, having fun on quests. And now I'm just doing... I'm actually tempted to go to the Grand Exchange to... Oh, sorry, I'm pressing the wrong button. I'm tempted to go to the Grand Exchange to drop the fish and rod off, just to do full inventories as well. I think I may. I'm going to be right back, reflames, okay? I'm going to drop the feathers and the fish and rod away, that you guys can stay. Don't worry, don't get separation anxiety. I'll be right back. Mummy's going to the Grand Exchange and back again. You'll be okay. It's fine. Mummy will be right back. See, I'm across the water. Bye-bye. I'll be right back. Literally. All right, I just need to drop this off so I can have full... No, not the book. Not the booth. I want the bank. I'm trying to see if I can do it through the ceiling. I can't. She's never coming back. I'm coming back. I just need to bank the banker. There, there, there. See, look, empty. Look, I'm already running back. I'm running out of stamina. It's okay. I'm a wee bit tired. I'm getting a wee bit tired. 45. Stamina. Wah, wah, wah. I'm coming back. I'm coming back. We're orphans! No! You can't be, you can't be, you can't be. See, look, look, look, I'm back. Look, who's that? Who's that? That's right. I'm on the other side of the water. Boom. I'm coming to pick up that trout that's on the floor there because there's tons. Oh, the renaissance of the fire as well. See, we have no home. See, look, I'm literally right here. Is there so dramatic? See, of all the trout. I'm max leveling up. I'm going to pick up all the ones on the floor. It's better to drop the trout. It's faster to drop it. Who dares the spots picking up? It's faster to drop the trout than it is to trade me. Right, okay, full inventory. We're going to be in the 50s after this. There's no way we're not. What were you doing with all those people in the business room? Dropping trout. Trout. Oh, pardon me. Trout. Trout. The fish. Trout. Trout. You don't need to see the sea at the end. Dropping trout. There's loads of words that I say like that. I can't believe it. Check your XP per hour on the bar. Why is it not displaying? This is I'm cooking. Cooked 92, 93 per hour burn. 23% burn rate. Why is it not displaying? I'm cooking though. It's not like telling me. Literally level 20. It's not like telling me. Hmm. Trout. It's short for trousers. Oh, this one. Oh, now we're talking. Hold on. Let me drop all these. It says for not fishing. Cooking. Where is cooking? Where's cooking? Here. Cooking's purple. Why would it be purple honestly? Let me grab all these trout. There's like so much on the floor honestly. I can't keep up. There's so much. It says I'm gaining 2,000 XP per hour. Oh, there's trout here. Trout, trout, trout. No, the trout. Not the fire. Now I've got to fill inventory. Let's see. XP gained 16 hour, roughly 2k, but it's probably going to go up for a bit because I'm not being done fill trout and XP left. Oh no, it's getting covered up by the freaking layer. I'm coming back in. We're at Barbarian Village at the free play fishing spot. But I think we're definitely higher. Yeah, this is going up. It says we're now 2.3 per hour. It's because we've not done it for an hour, but... Once we have... It says... Actually, I don't know if you can see that. Of course not. It literally says like six actions left and then we've leveled up, so that's really good. I like that. It kind of puts into perspective how much you need to do in order to get next. Next. You can write... Literally level 33. You can reset. I'll just leave that. That's the only burnt two. Oh, burnt three that time. They don't burn three that time. I'm so MLG pro. Oh, I shouldn't maybe drop the trout here. I don't know when I can start cooking salmon, but it should be sent to you. She needs that raw fish meat. Are you treating me fish? Oh no, I don't have inventory for that. Is that tuna? I'm pretty sure that's tuna. Sorry, I don't have any... Oh, you're giving me three tuna? I don't even think I'm like leveling enough to do that. What are you? Use tuna on the fire. Oh, I can. Oh, it's not tuna. Oh, what is it? It's tuna. Oh, burnt it. It's 100 XP. Wait, that's more XP than salmon. Okay. Reset. It seems to have bugged out. Okay, I'll reset. Sorry, reset. Oh, I know it's not the bomb. Oh, you can actually see it though, no? Tuna max and right now, Manstronia just really... That you and my definition of fun are completely different. I mean, I'm literally becoming a little chef. I'm able to feed all the reeflings like this now. Oh, she'll be getting all the thingies. Oh, it says I have nine actions left. That's so cool. That says like you literally have a number. Because soon it will be like 100 left and then it'll be 1000 left and I'll be like, that's fine. Her numbers are going way up. Literally, this is like... If you like slow incremental games that feel satisfying, RuneScape is definitely for you. I've never 99 something and I want to do it and you guys can hold me accountable for it. I'll literally tuna max and so whatever. Who's got trout up for me? No, that's cooked trout. That's raw trout, okay. Oh wait, is this accept trade? Do you got more tuna? It's the tuna man. Of course, it's fun. Numbers goes up. Don't for me and we all get literally... Wow, thank you so much for the tuna. How is everyone today? Someone asks. We're... We're tuna max... No, not tuna. Oh, I was talking. I was taking... Are you squiddin' me right now? Brian! We love when numbers go up, so have some numbers. Oh, money's different. Thank you for the tip, don't do that. We do love money going up in incremental video games. We're playing Cooking Sim and it's amazing. Hope... Hope your day is going well. Smile if you see. Always be nice to people. I am burning the absolute living daylights out of this tuna. I'm so sorry. I've just wasted all that tuna. So sorry. I have been here for like four hours. Oh, I keep messing it up. I wonder if you could sell cooked tuna for decent money. I don't think it's a cheap fish. I seem to think like... Alright, raw trout time. Uh, fishing levels? Uh, um... Anya? What the fuck? Runescape message saying I'm going to be logged in in 30 minutes, max six hours play. Wait, is that real? Wait, you got more tuna already? Wait, you can't have. How are you doing? Are you peddling tuna to me to level me up faster? I feel like I'm wasting all your tuna. Oh, no. Wait, are we finally doing it? Are we... Are we got tuna slave runners? Yeah, it's like there was log is real. Wait, am I going to be booted out or because I bought membership I'm not going to be booted out. I have plenty of tuna. I could literally buy a million. Hey, Strony. Am I in trouble for cooking my own food tonight? Does that mean I could just jump into the kitchen? You're allowed to make it. He... That is messed up. I'm not a child. Literally why is the game doing it for like bandwidth issues? If you're a free member, they're like, oh, we've had enough of you. Strony becomes a master chef but can't fight a rat. No, it was the cow that was going to kill me. It was a baby cow. And you just log in right back after. That's bizarre. No, my... What? Well, it says we've been up for seven hours or is it because I got logged out when I went away for like a cup of tea and that? I wonder if that's why. Hold on. Is tuna max... Is tuna max through there? I've got Buddha at one point. Yeah, you've just been DCing a lot. Okay, every time I go for Tinkle Winkle, I've been DCed so it doesn't count. How much do you care about doing the proper way? I think I'm supposed to do wine next. Someone says, hi, Emmy. Is the Emmy imposter here? Where's the Emmy imposter? Oh, there it is. You changed your name to Emmy Bizoon Game. Level 113. That's a big account, honestly. Okay, let me grab this. Emmy's... Emmy's a RuneScape nerd. No, it's not the real Emmers, but someone likes her, so I'm glad someone enjoys her as much to do that. Emmy the Goal, honestly. What's the fit on Emmy? Oh, they changed her hair to look like her pumpkins and everything. And give her a skirt. That's supposed to be her blue shorts. Okay, okay, okay. Let him get up, let him get up. Where is that? We're already level 35. We should've came here, like, from the beginning. We wouldn't even have had to do anything. Yeah, and that baby cow has been caught in front of a king. Hydration check. I'm actually running out of water. What's mercy, one hour? Wah. It gives me, like, relief drink and water for a millisecond, and then I feel the pain of talking again. Let's do this raw trip. Raw trip. Oh, sorry. I keep forgetting Mr. Tuna Man. Sorry, guys. I got, like, three space. That tuna man going ham. Oh my God, that's so much money. Absolutely nothing. And then the value on your side is just, like, losing horrifically. I can do one more inventory, and then I have to do some rune crafting for my clan skull. Okay, thank you so much. Excuse me, ma'am. We had to level up to 20 fishing to start fishing here. Yes, you have to go back to the Castello. Good luck. Thank you so much for the... Thanks for all the fish. I'm pretty sure that is the ending to a movie that Bilbo was in that I haven't watched yet. I can't remember. But it goes thanks for all the fish. Level 36. Oh my God. The tuna, literally a hundred of pop as well, is crazy. He keeps in the bunny soup girl turning into a guy. Oh, never mind. It's because they're dancing on each other. Hitchhiker's guide. Yes, I've not seen that. Good Lord, you're still alive? Yeah, we're tuna maxing. We're currently level 36. And cooking is that purple one right there. Here. We're level 36. Apparently your egg steeper hour is like freaking 56K with the tuna. It's like going up like crazy. So much tuna. You know what's really nice? Tuna, cucumber, meal. Like uncrusted bread. Oh, no, no, no. It's delicious. Can we cook raw salmon yet? Let me check. Use the salmon on the fire. What's everyone's opinion on anchovy pizza? Oh, I can cook salmon. Okay. I can pick up salmon now as well. Right. I'll pick up salmon and trout so I can just like do it all. Level 50 is about 100K egg fee total. What's my total egg fee? I am one fourth of the way to level 50. I'm not sure I can do it before Maryse goes online. Oh, I'll be cutting it close, I think. Oh, no, I can't. I would have to be tuna maxing. Unless the salmon does it, I'm not sure. Unless the salmon does it. And if I stop burning everything. I'm scooping up all this trout. I'm scooping it up. My inventory is getting so full. Someone's got a mini cliff. No, but that is huge. It's so fast with the salmon as well. Oh, five more salmon and then level up again. Oh, come on, you can do it. Two more. One more. Yes! 30 freaking six. 37, sorry. I know numbers sometimes. Oh, we are tuna maxing. We are fish maxing out the wazoo right now. Stronny. You can do it, Stronny. Cook this, Galea's base starts late. There's neither motor. There's neither motor. There's neither motor. There's neither motor. We're going to do it, we're going to do it. Tuna is more XP than salmon. Salmon's more XP than trout. But unfortunately I'm still at the burning stage, so I'm not maximising my inventory right now. I don't think there's any other quests that give cooking XP that I know of other than... There's probably a ton of members' quests that do have, like, cooking XP. But as it stands right now, we'll do full inventory of raw trout. But once we start, once we stop burning, then we can do, like, max inventory XP gains, which is really handy down there. Who took that little bit sound? Who taking my trout? You need my trout. Salmon might honestly be better rates when you factor in the burn rate. Mmm. It's possible. Someone else here is, like, snatching up the salmon, which is fine. Honestly, it's not like the trout is, like, bad or anything. I know we'll make it to 40. The question is how far in? True mummy gamey here, honestly. Click simulator. But it's so good though! Oh, like, RuneScape is so nostalgic. Look, it's like, I love how the Rune plug-in, or whatever it's called, RuneLight, literally absolutely annihilating out here. Salmon's success rate at 38 is 74%. Mmm, that's not bad. Everyone in four? Everyone in four. Okay, who has the XL spreadsheet? An optimal fish cookin'. The best member's quest for it is the family crest, so you get gloves that would just burn it. Oh, I've never done, I don't know what that is actually. It sounds difficult though, because for something to be such a good item, I feel like they would have put it behind, like, really difficult quests. Oh, if I can pick up a few of these salmon, I'll make the photos. RuneLight is insane. I can never play with a vanilla client again. Get mugged. I suppose if you want, like, super nostalgic, just leave it as is. Right, we'll do the trout first, because I want, like, I don't want to have higher rate of burning the salmon, since it offers more. Do you just stream forever, strong? I just really enjoy streaming, and I like hanging out with refunds, especially on days where we get to play a multiplayer game, where we get to be together. I really like that. I'm actually going off a bit earlier than expected. When Mercy comes online in an hour, I'm raiding into her. And the only reason I'm not doing an endurance today, hmm, is because my voice is very sore, and I have an ASMR stream tomorrow, so I'm gonna have to try and rest it a bit better than usual, than the usual when a game is this old. Yes, if my voice wasn't sore, I unironically just do 12 hours again. I'm sorry. I would. I said it. I said what we're all thinking. You all know what... Oh no, I didn't cook those raw salmon. Silly Billy. Oh no, it's giving me the actual salmon. Ah, oh well. I'm not salmon maxing. I'm not a real salmon max, so I can't believe it. I'm sorry you had to all find out this way. Let's do a try. We're doing... We're getting pretty good at try. We're getting pretty good. Over eight hours not endurance. Come on now. I don't know, I feel like... You know when you have like a regular nine to five job? Like, obviously I had quite a few. And I just put it in perspective. Like, I'm literally memeing about on a video game. I get to like play and like have fun times with you. And it just like... Oh my god, wait. Is this Trinna Man back? Hold on, is Trinna Man back? Trinna, I thought you had to go do some things with your clan or something. Oh my god, we're Trinna Maxing again. Oh! Half a million? Are you sure? I mean, I ain't gonna say no. How are you all so rich? Where are you... What are you doing to make money in RuneScape? What are the ways to buy some good fish with it? Thank you, Reefling. Oh my gosh, when the time comes. Yes, when I don't burn stuff. How... I have three billion on an Iron Man account. How do you make money in RuneScape? Seriously? Trinna Man! How? How do you make money on RuneScape? I don't know how. I'm gonna put this money in the bank so I'm not full. The more you play, the higher stats you get raised. Strawni get... get hella high level so we can do raids. Oh! What's raiding? Oh, you guys teach me how to raid. International Bank of Strawni, honestly though. Oh, I wanted to get a pet that looked like you guys as well. That was another goal. So 99... Um... 99, um... Cookin'. And then I want to get a pet that looks like you guys. But I don't know how the pets work. Golly, double neck. Okay. I'm gonna go put this in the bank. No, VC. Math wants to choose. Math, I don't have much inventory. I'm sorry. Oh yeah, give me them... Sardines? You giving me... Oh! Oh yeah, we got pike ladies and gentlemen. Get that cooked. Get that cooked on that fire thing. Thank you. Get that cooked. Oh, it made me 39! Economic Dragon Bitter. Not to be confused with the German word bitter, which means please, I think. Bitter? No. I don't think that's what that means in German. Hee-hee-hee. Also high level drops peaking. No, I couldn't do peaking. Oh, I'm coming back. Don't worry, Reeflings, I'm coming back. Mummy's putting the money in the bank. I'm coming back, okay? Mummy needs to pay rent, so I'm putting it in the bank. We need to rent that location out for only us. Bitter means please, okay? No, Reeflings, don't cry, I'm coming back. Sorry, I forgot to say that, I needed to go. I'm putting this in the bank, okay? Look, bank. And look at that. We're max. Look how much fish we've got. 200 raw ship. 600 salmon. 450 swordfish. 500 lobster's raw tuna. Like, there's so much. I don't want to burn any of this, though. Bitter means you are welcome. Oh, Dankeschon. Bitter. Okay, there we go. There's a sentence that you could use in. Oh, no, Dankeschon? Or Dankeschon? No, I think it has a kh. Don't worry, Reeflings, I'm coming back. Look, see, I'm coming, I'm coming. Look, look, look, you're gonna render again. Yay, Reeflings! All the Reeflings are here. You've got money to burn all that fish. You're loaded, holy. Literally, a Reefling gave me 10 million. Another gave me a million. One just gave me half a million there. But I don't want to waste it. I don't want to waste the money. Oh, sorry, sorry, I accept. Sorry, I'm fish-maxing, okay? Where's Mommy? Mommy's back, Mommy's back. How much XP do you get for this? I didn't even know you could fish it here. Can't believe someone went... What? I can't believe someone went more dry than I did on a dragonfish. How much did we get? Oh, we got A.A. for these? These are the same as mine? We cease to exist when you leave us. No! Reeflings! Bitter means a bunch of things, including both. Okay. My German knowledge is expanding. I know to expand my Puerto Rican knowledge. That's all you get. Okay. I don't know how many pets I got. Can you own all the pets that won? Oh, they're like little symbols to show what won. There's 24 pets! What? How? How's there 24? There are 59 pets? What? That's a lot. Yeah, especially now because I have a chain made in a void worker jam. Is that how you attract pets to you? You wear jewelry? They're like, ooh, shiny. Is there a magpie pet? What have we got? Oh, actually, I've picked the place clean. That's how much I'm fish-maxing. There's nothing on the ground. I've picked it clean. Oh, wait. There's a trade. Ah! I'm missing. A rubbish aimbot. Whoa, yeah. 17. 39. All salmon. We're all in on salmon. Salmon cook and run. We're almost level 40. 40's like a melody and... Oh, sorry. I just punched them. I can hear that. There's a little anime there. Stronti only just starts streaming. She's already a 1% earner in this game. Wait, really? Is level 40 a 1% thing? Like, hardly anyone gets to 40 in something? Shorty's like a melody and... I can't keep growl. Got me singing like... Na na na na na. Every day. Like my eyes. Is it like my eyeballs stuck on the plate? Those bars were good. She punched the refline. I'm sorry. There's a fishing pit, but you have to be on a member's role to get it, and scaling pits are especially good. He means the money to do some... We hit 40! We hit 40! Actually so good. I might make one last cup of tea. We need a lock-in. We need a lock-in, okay. Lobster time. Oh no, I'm not gonna waste a lobster. That's crazy. I'm not gonna waste the lobsters. Oh! I mean, unless you give me lobsters, that's different. If you give me lobsters to waste, that's different. I'm not sure what my fricking rate is gonna be. Burn them all. Oh, I kicked my first one correctly! Wah! 120? Oh no! They're getting burned. I know you can't see them over my... My heart. Can I move myself over just a tiny bit more? I don't want it. Actually, yeah. Yeah? Okay, yeah, that's better. You can, like, really see the inventory and stuff. Learning. We're gonna keep learning. If all the boys get 40 fishing, must the point will be for pure lobsters. Wait, you wanna do lobsters? Wait, you guys stay up all night just so you can get 40 fishing? So we can do lobster runs? 120 is a lot. Look at the success rate, though. What does it say? Oh, the success rate is going up. It's 20%. What's that? Oh, that's mine. That's mine. Oh, rest well, those two sleep. I'm sorry, I streamed so long. For those of you who do need to leave, please don't worry. I'm literally doing this until the end. We're gonna read it in a mercy, because my poor voice is feeling it, Mr. Prev. There's no way you already have more freaking lobsters for me or something. Oh, okay, okay. We go pick, go pick. This is crazy. This is crazy. Can you get in trouble by Jagex for doing this? I can stay until 40, fish up or lobsters. No, that's crazy. I'm at 31 fishing at the moment. I got distracted watching you forgot to go back more. Goodnight, sleepers, rest well. Never can see how much seafood you are wasting. No! I just meant for the lobsters. That one. Long streams are good, because I can catch them when I wake up. I will sleep when I'm beat by drowning by more domination of the cheese. Oh, my God, we're almost 41. Oh, freaking crazy. We just wear a 40. Sleep is a construct. Construct is a government I've never given. Oh, my gosh. Can we do it? Can we make it 41 already? One more? Don't burn them. No, don't burn them. I should burn it. 40 freaking one. No! This is so good. Oh, my God. You're already trading with me. I hope I can't get in trouble by jargates from this. Stuff like this can run the game for new players, so be careful about donations for new players long term. I have played, I do have a basic concept of the game, but if you're going to ask me to do dungeoning and stuff, I could not tell you where the gargoyles are, but apparently gargoyles. Hey, Strony, how do you get a fishing rod? I've never tried this before. Aw, you tiny culls. You would have to level up with that fishing net you got from Tutorial Island, but you can't use it here. You would have to go back to Lumbridge. This is Lumbridge, where you came from. You can use the magic spell to teleport, and you have to do net fishing here until 20. And then you can come here for a fly fishing. I'm so sorry, Little Reefling. There are gates to level up on fishing. They're probably a lot better than my method, but that's why I've always used it with the kids. Gargoyles are decent money for mid players, but 75 slayers is probably the slowest of them even. That burn rate is looking a bit rough on the lobster, so I'm not going to lie. Anyone got some feathers on them? So, well, I guess that's all great. Aw, thank you, Little Reefling. That burn rate is looking rough. Oh, my God, what should I do? I feel about it. How expensive are the lobsters? I feel like they're probably breaking through. We're burnt through the fish already. No, we're not. I tell a lie. Let's forget. Who are you coming so fast? You just handed me them. Is there a bank nearby? I thought the bank was over there. Am I going crazy? Is there a bank up there? He's just disappeared again. Is there a bank up there? Ageville has a bank. Oh, I'll make sure you... Call meville, because, I don't know, there's something. If I could trade. I'm so sorry. Wait, I'll trade. I'm sorry. I'll trade. Okay, I'll trade. I'll trade. I'll trade. I'll trade. Bro's hacking. Can you even hack in RuneScape? That sounds like it's nice and possible, because of the way the server is. Call meville, because I'm edging. Yes! Call meville, because I'm edging. I came up with that myself. I did. I did. It's true. You could start using a range closer to the bank rather than the fire rate, since you don't fish in anymore. Probably. That's very true. Oh, that burn rate is rough on those lobbies. Every lobster that we burn is a missing, like, 120, which is, like, so frigging thingy. I lied. I made it. Wait, there's another refling. There's the strategy. Hold on. Wait, you've got lobster runs as well? Whoa! Isn't this not, like, thousands, like, thousands of gold? Am I not going mental? I feel like this is, like, thousands. Go ahead and run. Energy needs to recharge. Whoa, we got a full shoot. Five in a row. 42! It depends on how fast you want to get this level, but Bar Village is more... The most... The most cooking ranges. You can make a million per hour? A million XP per hour? Strony, even if it says and you've already been given millions? Honestly. If you take the exclamation mark, praise? What? Stop! Did you make me... Did you just make me fall for something obvious? I don't know. Yeah, I spent 160 on 2k. That's, like, two voxels. You have to take that. I'm afterward. Oh, knee drop, knee drop. Oh, yeah, that was a much better lobster cooking batch than the previous one, the other one that I absolutely cooked with them. Ooh, fishy. Oh, right, okay, take that. Let's try and do this. Exclamation mark, praise? Let it all be set to error. Oh! It worked! Oh, there are 150 a pack? Ooh. If I buy feathers from people we drop on? Okay, 300k. Oh, great. Right, don't buy any more fish, cos it's literally I've got less than 50 minutes now. I'm gonna go quickly grab a bottle of water. Cos I'm so thirsty. I don't need to, I don't need to, I don't need to, I don't need to, I don't need to, I don't need to, I don't need to. Ooh. Wow! Ooh, ooh, I hear burning noises. I hear burning noises. Cos we're burning deficies. Right, I've got a new bowl of water. I'm so hydrated, but I don't want to pee, I want to fish max. I need to fish max, you don't understand. I'm fish maxing, you wouldn't get it. I have lobby maxing, you wouldn't get it. You wouldn't understand, Mum. Mum, I need membership. I'll give it a try, I'll be back in a minute. Go for it. I've only been listening to ASMR for about a minute, so I'm excited for starting ASMR. I definitely am not the best. I would say like, Mercy and Icy are like super professional. Super idol. 43! And we've had a lot of two-stacked... Oh, I was about to say, we've got two-stacked for all of the lobbies not being burnt. Spoke too soon there. Hydration check. Wow. You know, as much as the chef hat and the apron are made out of gold, I don't think it's actually making me a better chef. How much longer before you have to leave? Is there a exact time? Mercy is coming on in 45 minutes. I'm going to redirect into her because I need to do vocal rest before the ASMR stream tomorrow. And it hurts to talk right now, which is a shame. It's literally the only reason I'm going offline. I probably didn't during the stream every single day if I killed it, honestly. But my voice is sore and I need to be quiet for the ASMR. Tomorrow's going to be a short... No, you guys are so quick on it. This is crazy. It doesn't make sense. They're gold, literally. Drink some nice hot tea. Yes, I've had too much tea today. Because I put honey in my tea, it gets, like, sickly if I have too much of it, so I have to swap to water only. What's your target that you're going for this stream? I wanted to get 50, but I don't think it's possible because of time. I didn't realise how fast cooking the fish was going to be if I wasn't, like, doing those quests. But I had fun doing quests for the reason, so actually, I don't really regret it at all. I'll be cutting it close. Like, if we're literally, like, a couple of minutes away, then I'll do it. But, unfortunately, my voice is, like... Yeah. And most of all, I felt that one literally... I do look stylish, though. I mean, look at that. Something a little cosy. Look at the detail in my eyes and everything. The polys are the favourites all the time. Honey in tea is good. Maybe I'll add less honey. I don't know. I feel, like, sickly if I... I don't know, I just can't. It's just not working. It's just not working. I know you can have those throat sweets, but I don't know if they actually do anything or just, like, make my teeth feel a little sugary. It's, like, my biggest frickin' thing. Wait, hold on. Am I taking this? I can't remember who I keep taking off of. I'm sorry for whoever the other lobster runners, like, I can't remember between... 200k feathers under me. Damn. Damn. Damn, you're in a wedding dress and everything. What the heck? All of your black hair, this is cute. And your little cape. Oh, I forgot to get us green capes. Oops. We'll do the next thing. Can you say throat sweets again? Yeah, throat sweets. They, like, help with your throat when you feel sick or whatever. Or if you've got strain, I guess. Are you still streaming? Yeah, um, we've got roughly 40 minutes. And then it's Mercy's time. We're gonna redirect into Mercy. Bon bon. Oh, I'm making an absolute mockery of this one. I don't think I'm gonna burn it, alright. Yeah. Oh, we're close to the 44, though. Bicola. Wait, Bicola? Wait, what's Bicola? I can hear that, Bicola. What's that mean, chan? Huh? Eto? What's that? Bicola. A tape of throat lozenger. Oh, it's a cough drug. Bicola is a brand of lozenger. Oh, okay, okay. Oh, sorry. Wah. Here you go. Here you go. Lobster runner. I can't believe it. Might as well do 99 room crafting while we're at it. You guys will make it super easy. It's the comical jingle that was very common. Oh, it's a commercial jingle. Sorry. Ah, I see, I see, I see. But not I see smokers. But I see. There's a new... New room craft minigame, and it's fun. Anyone else able to see the feathers yet? No, you might have to pick them up in case it's too much when you defawn. No feathers. Yeah, hopefully they don't defawn, because 20k feathers isn't cheap. Did you time the six feathers? Johnny's so cool and got excited. This is Coca-Cola. It's so much. How long does it take after doffin'? I thought it was 60 seconds. If it's been 60 seconds, I would just scoop them back up again, because I would hate them to... No, not the headbinds! What a book. Wah. Level 40 fricking four. If I could stop fricking burning them lobsters, they'll... Wah. They'll accept trade, accept trade. We're getting there though. Do you have less burn chance on a... a grill thing? An oven? A grill thing. 30 seconds to appear to others, three minutes to despawn. We're learning. We're learning the ways a burn stage is done. No only in whose side it is. Wah. Range and fire are the same kissing chance, mostly. Okay, there's no point. I was like, maybe we should move this production line, but... I think the rooflings are just fishing away. They're just having a good time. We definitely need to level ourselves up, because we're the target for a lot of NPCs when we're trying to travel through areas. The stream's ending in 40 minutes. Does that mean brush teeth intend? Yes! We have to brush our teeth. Okay, thank goodness I didn't make another teeth, because I wouldn't have been able to brush my teeth. If you're having... If you want to brush your teeth with us for your enameled... Don't eat or drink fizzy juice. You can have water for the next 30 minutes, but you're not to brush your teeth if you've eaten after 30 minutes, because it hurts your enamel rather than helping it. I think that's my only note if you want to brush your teeth with us. Not so fun story. My brother once choked on one of those throat sweeps and helped with the throat throat. Ooh, that's terrifying. 45? 45? 45? We're at 61 8 feet. Oh, goodness. We may actually make the 50. You know that. Ah, my throat farted when I swallowed it. Did you hear that? That was like an internal throat fart. I said that! 1 in 3. Oh, baby. He learned so much from this educational and professional streamer. That takes me back to the toothbrush somewhere. We are so going to get 50 before Mercy comes on and makes me funny. Oh, Mercy's actually... I think she's decorating alternative outfits for us. So... We are in... Have our lobster reserves ran dry. Have I perished all the lobsters for sale in the Grand Exchange? Oh, unless. Unless. Unless. You guys are sweating to get me to level 99. You're actually so kind. I just want to say a special thank you for those of you who are like unironically feeding me. This is going to make the school way faster doing this. Hmm. You'd say that Stronny's a really good drop. What? Do you think she'd make you one of those? What? What is going on? No stops on this lobster train. Literally. I know the fishing spot. Nearly one million XP an hour. Stop. Is that it? Unlucky. I love stories. I suppose if I didn't burn them, that's very plausible. Every stack is like... What, 26 inventory? Like... I think five tables are shooting it. I don't know. With some tick manipulation. I don't know what the tick rate manipulation stuff means. I hear it all the time though. It's like, oh you just got to make sure you do this on the tick and you have to eat. You have to eat the food on the tick. Oh, can I swap out prayer? I need a prayer flick. I need a prayer flick. Like, I'm like, what does any of this mean? You're crazy. Crazy. Also, for those of you using runelight, if you don't want an item name to show up, can hold, alt, and write... the irons here. We're getting the real stress here. Being an apron has always been a dream of mine. The game runs on 0.62nd increments called ticks. That's it. Oh! That basic... Okay, that just like explains everything. That's it. That's all it took. One sentence and it all makes sense. Okay, because I was like, prayer, I need prayer flick on this tick. Like, over prayer flick. I'm like, what? I'm not, I'm even sure that's supposed to be having the games played. I don't know. Did the devs intend that? But they never patched it out. So I guess prayer flicking is the right way to go. Because prayer drains so fast. I'm getting new brain cells just from streaming. Level 47? No. Oh wait, sorry, 46. Two more. If I don't burn these. If I don't burn this one. 46. Oh my gosh. We're so MLG pro. Look at me, bro. Look at me, bro. MLG pro. Let me see. Oh my god, my tummy's rumbling. You could hear that over the background. Wow. I'm literally slid. It's not intended, but Jagex just accepted. I was going to say, if they didn't, whenever like something gets discovered, like, so this is for the overwatch players, but Mercy had a guardian angel leap. And it got discovered and it was never patched out the game, which meant it was intended, even though it was never described. So that's how I take it. If the devs don't patch it out, it's allowed, basically. Once you get to level 92, you're halfway there. Yay. Anyway, congrats, dumb dumb. This was the stream I was looking forward. The less, but ended up probably being one of the funniest, really? It's just me receiving, like, tons of in-game currency for doing nothing. But please don't worry, if you're interested in more, like, multiplayer games where we can play together, I definitely am doing, like, a whole variety of things going on. I would definitely, like, other ones, like... No, that's not what's official name. What's the name of the game? Fall Guys. I wanted to give Fortnite a chance. Apparently, Fortnite has added, like, different game modes. Call of Duty has apparently introduced prop one. I don't know if we could... Oh, there's a captain. Do we do the captain mini-quest? I don't know if we do the captain one. At the Fortnite metal path. I just shit out my hands. It's... Is it bad? Is it a bad quest? Is it the captain, or is it a good one? It's quick. Okay, if it's quick, let's try it. Problem is, these old-time... Uh, sure, I'll help you unlock your chest. There are three columns. What you need to do is match up each picture on the column. A bar, a ring, and a bowl. Oh, got a wee golden ring! Um... What'd I do with it? I already have a diamond ring on from a wreathling, so I can't take it off. Oh, I'm sorry, sorry. I completely forgot we're trying to lobster max right now. Oops. One less space, one less space, because I'll drop the golden ring. Oh, I could have gave you the golden ring, actually, because lobsters trading there. The ring's your problem now. Captain is the worst random? No. The sign which lady is, she never gives you anything good. Hail divers, mollo player. Is that easy to say at all? Well, sign which lady and quiz master already. Quiz master's rubbish, I don't like that one. Uh, for... Stroudy, please don't play Fortnite. Oh no, what's wrong? It's bad game. It's bad game. Get that steal, but yeah, I think it's kind of drop in, drop out. Um, I would like to play among us so I can start screaming at you, and I'll be like, it's red, it's red, wreathlings, you don't believe me, it's red. But we'll have to, we'll have to try it and see what happens. Okay, I'm done. I'm so, I'm so emoji. Look at me like, I'm literally hovering ready for the trade offer. Like, yeah, yeah, give me the trade offer. Oh, look, your problem now. There you go. Oh, your problem now. There you go. Oh, yours golden rings yours. Thank you for all the lobsters. Among us. You've never played among us? Deep Rock Galactica. We can play Deep Rock together. Can I force you guys to play that Mains of Moria game with me? I'm too scared to ask the girls to play in case they absolutely despise it. So, although I may be able to convince Sheebie. There's a Mains of Moria game. It's like, it's literally Deep Rock Galactica, but Lord of the Rings, Quidditch. You want to try Warframe. It's freeing up to four man squads. Ooh. I think you can force us to do anything you want to try. I haven't ever heard of it. I've never got advertised well. The only reason I've popped up for me is because I'm on Lord of the Rings side of TikTok. So, if there's anything Lord of the Rings, Lord of the Rings related. Oh my God, we're going to level up. 40 freakin' seven. Oh my gosh. This is getting insane. Oh crap. Thank you. Thank you, Reflings. I appreciate it. Literally everyone feeding me. We're all like, fishing away, leveling up and stuff. I think we'll play RuneScape during, on the third week of streams, I think we might do a double RuneScape to make sure we really get there, XP-wise. I'll break it up in between the week just so it's not like a full day of RuneScape and then one right after it. Because I know RuneScape isn't for everyone. I know it might be a bit of a snooze fest, but for me it's so satisfying. Like, bigger number? Bigger number? Big number. Big number. Like, it's like really good for me. But I guess maybe watching it it might be better, like if it was a compilation or like a highlight, you know. Still do Warframe. It's the worst game to be a new player and 100% confusing and there's a neat tutorial. Deep Rock Season 5 is a bit of a horror show right now. What is it? Number go up. RuneScape is definitely a talking stream, like a datzu, like back and forth. I like meme-ing with one of each other. I'm like learning about the game and stuff. I don't know enough about RuneScape. Literally, I was in kindergarten when I said the best I did as a kid was do cooking and then probably do 40 and then that's the best. I actually don't know how the game works. So much lobster. Rock lobster. Nuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Uh, b52 is anyone? The Reflane is, could you trouble you to play Voices of the Void? I don't know what that is. Is it an MMO? Or like single? Or what? What kind of game? game. This review thing is a deep one. Final Fantasy 14. I was gonna give it a shot but yeah. I never ended up playing it. I don't know if they say they roleplay a lot in it. Honestly, I don't mind. It'll be fun to roleplay. A roleplay is what though. I don't know what a roleplay is. I've had a choice to roleplay something. I don't know. Save Heroes is free to play. Super hero animal. Oh, I think I said I wanted to play Marvel Rivals. We might play that but I don't know if it's in beta or if that's it fully out. I don't know. Oh, my tummy's wobbling. I don't know what to do. Strony and her 100 husbands. Isn't this the life though? You know, you have to wait to get your one-on-one attention but then that makes it so much more worth it. Why do I keep fricking snail blinking? I'm gonna have to change that. Please stop blinking one at a time. I'm gonna have to make the sensitivity different. Any trenches in trying Lord of the Rings online? Like Shadow of the Rings online? You mean Elden Scrolls online? Or is there like a Lord of the Rings online I have no idea about? I'm actually playing Final Fantasy while watching the stream. Speaking of fact, cannot decide. I work in accounting and I'm the only guy with nine girls in the office. Hey, what a ladies man. Check it out. You get a nice view all day long. There's a Lord of the Rings. Maybe I've seen it and I'm just being a dum-dum. I can't recall it off the toilet in the head. Should I move? I feel like I'm like in the way here. Oh, I can't even access the fire. Oh, I can't even access the fire though. Dum-dum. Oops, sorry. I'm already accepted. It's pretty old. Does Lord of the Rings online still even have server? Yeah, I don't even think I've seen any gameplay of it. Unless I have in my brains just not putting them two together. 171 successful cooks to go. Not sure how many could in burnings, so probably ten more traps. Wow. We're at 81,000 XP on cooking. We need 20k more when it's mercy. 20 minutes on mercy. I don't know. If we could stop burning. There's no way you're still headbanging over there. Are you not tired of clicking the button? Brightly Lord of the Rings is microtransaction to heck. Okay, that's probably why I haven't heard about it because everyone just saw how much of a grab it was. I lost my little face. Yeah, maybe I am. Maybe I'm just headbanging. I mean, barbed village is a thing. Yeah, we might maybe do a watch along of stuff for the later levels. Oh, 48, man. That's so good. Literally, I was aiming for 40, and I'm so happy with what we've got. Obviously, special shout out to the reflins who are supplying a ridiculous amount of money and fish and everything to me because it is insane. And literally, the reflins down here that are just chilling and fishing away, they're just having a good time leveling up fishing. What are your fishing levels? Hold on, let me type. Fishing level check. Fishing level check. I'm still struggling early game fishing and cooking so the lumberjoo shrimp, it takes forever to net some shrimp and then you burn them to heck. If you guys want to catch up to her, I'll give you what I have left after stream. Out of curiosity, are you avoiding profanity for any reason? A little bit. The AI can tell, like the AI can read what my voice is, so I kind of try and swap out words over time because I am quite outrageous at certain sections, so I try and tone it down as long as you get a good 80-20 mix, then overall you're fine, which is why I swap out words sometimes. I have enough eggs to be for night night twice, unfortunately. A little refling's cute surprise of the stream. Oh, we keep burning them. Oh lobbies, you're not as easy to cook as I thought. My little, my caviar. But yes, I maybe need to think of, like, maybe we watch movies whilst we runescape in the background or something. I mean, I can do a set of watch one movie, obviously I can't show it, but I can show the timer so as we jump in at any point. Maybe Harry Potter, do you guys like Harry Potter? I've watched it through for the first time, a couple years back, I've not seen the full thing. Not particularly, okay, maybe not, sorry, sorry, maybe not, maybe it's a girl's movie. Apologies. Is there a C- John Wick series? We'll watch the John Wick series movies, that would be a good one. I think everyone who's ready for RuneScape and Chill, honestly, John Wick RuneScape and Chill, I'll put down the sound of the game like really low and we'll just watch the movie. And it's just me going, in the movie, and then every time I level up I also go, the first three movies of Harry Potter is pretty comfortable. Yeah, I guess really dark at the end, which I don't. You could do a pool on which movies, yeah. Just because of how long, like the grains are, I would kind of want to do series movies and John Wick has three installments, I'm pretty sure, which is why I quite like that. What about Shrek? Oh, I don't like the later Shrek. Is it Shrek happily ever after? John Wick has four? Have I seen the fourth one? I might know you haven't seen the fourth one. I don't know, there's a fourth installment. Huh. I have a silly idea. What's your idea? Hmm, you have me curious. Speak your truth. Stroney, how do you feel about Spider-Man movies? You want to watch the original Spider-Man? Like the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man? So we can all have a gig a lot of the dancing. Hmm. Tobey Maguire is a must, I don't know. I remember like a freaking babbling and watching the movies practically. Yeah, the fourth, the final chapter is the fourth. Okay, okay, okay. Stroney, did you know that Lord of the Rings trilogy lasts less than one of your endurance streams? I'm saving myself. I'm saving myself for the Lord of the Rings on Christmas Day. I am abstaining from such beautiful literature, such beautiful media that was created for human consumption. So we're not going to watch them for this. The Sam Remy trilogy. Yes, Spider-Man 3. I don't think I saw that one. I didn't see any of the Spider-Man's that have Emma Stone in it. But I watched Spider-Man. We're all three of them were in the same movie. And Tobey was like, yeah, it just comes out of my wrist. And the other two were like, huh? Because I couldn't believe it. Because I think the new, oh, I'm really bad with people's names. The new Spider-Man has to use nanotechnology from Iron Man to get his gunk out. I don't know what Garth feels. Honestly, any of the Spider-Man movies, the movies are great. Okay. 49. Oh my gosh, 49 just popped. Feels good, man. Tom Holland. Ah, his name's Tom Holland. I sing the praises of the apocrity diary for anyone who wants them. Is it a movie? I'm not heard of it. Is it a game or a movie? Oh, my tummy's so hungry. But I can't make food. I must grind. I must fish max. We are fish maxing. We hitting 50 before Mercy. Before, I think so. We are like blasting through these levels. It's crazy. 0.7% of the weight of 99. Let's go. Oh, I read apocrity novel. Aren't there like seven Highlander movies? It's Mad Max, a one-off movie. I think so. That new Mad Max, I think is good. The one that was like, witness me, and he put spray can on his teeth. That one was pretty good. Those one-off movies are... Oh, sorry. I just clicked. I misclicked. Oh, sorry, sorry. The grind. The grind, please. The lobster maxing. I can't do it if I'm not misclicking. It was a misinput, misinput. Fury Road was one. XP waste. No, don't bully me over my XP wasting. It says I need 54 cooks, and I've got level 50. If I can stop burning them, maybe two more inventories of lobbies. Oh, maybe two. We can do it in two. Where are... If only I knew how many hours I spent bank standing. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I think your ping may be blessed, possibly. Get that fire on. Get that fire on. Get that lobby on the fire. Not the misinput. Blade Runner? Ooh, that's a good suggestion. I thought about because of the Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling. I don't know why that was so hard to say Ryan. Because of the Ryan Gosling movies, I thought it would be funny if we did like a six girl watch along of it, like all six of us watching it. And then whenever Ryan comes on screen, all of us can be like, oh, that's literally my refling. That's literally my like, bleeding heart. That's literally my snippet. That's literally my pinpal. I'm on world 380 at Barbarian Village. Unfortunately, I'm literally about to go off in 13 minutes. Because Mercy's coming online. And literally, oh my god, that's my refling. Oh my god, my refling's so strong. I'm gonna just be like complimenting you the entire stream. Okay, it says 34 more lobsters. Okay, this time, two more inventories. I'll do it. Can't stop burning these lobbies. Wow. That Gosling, literally. I wouldn't mind rewatching The Blade Runner because I didn't like fully comprehend it at first. So it'd be nice to like see it again, kind of mildly knowing what happens. Have you watched Seven Cycle Path? Movie before? No, I haven't. I'm not sure what that is. That Gosling, literally. Can't wait to see us all together again. Can't wait as well. We've got our first group collab, and then we've got our one-on-one collab coming out soon again. So I'm gonna see. Can I please stop burning these lobbies, please? I think I can do it. But yes. I think I said a little bit before, we're a little bit limited on multiplayer games that we can all play together, so I think I will encourage like some trio collabs or quad man collabs at some point, but it'll be fun to see everyone's like dynamic with each other. I hope no one's scared of me. Strawny smells, how dare you? How do your accusations? I smell like burnt lobster, burnt shrimp, burnt trout, burnt salmon, burnt pike. I smell like burnt everything because I can't stop freaking messing up. I need to kick 13 lobsters in the snatch and I level up, and I burn three in a row, of course, when I say that. Four in a row! That's more like it. Trying to upset me video game, it's working. I saw the fish she's handling, so sniff the stuff. Looking forward to main crash shenanigans. Yeah, that's in July. July shenanigans. I'm not beating the front end. Eating Strawny's burnt food sign me up. Oh, no, those are carcinogenic. You're not supposed to eat burnt any kind of food. Wait, why did she smell like fish? We're the ones who are questioning. We did it! We're 50! We actually did it, no way. Mercy's up in 10. No, we've got 50. That's insane. Thank you so much, we've got 50. And that was like messing about questing as well and all that. I look forward to less burning. M-A-B-Zoo, congrats. Honestly, I hope I'll stop burning. Oh my god, I'm so MLG pro at cutting fish. Ah! I'll send the crunch. It says the value is 2.3k for that batch of lobsters? I thought lobsters were a money maker. Okay, well, I hope to see you play old school again. Yeah, we'll play it once next week on week two and then we'll play it twice on week three during the week, but I'll split it up just in case because I don't know. RuneScape isn't the most interesting. Not anymore with all the bots. Maybe the bots aren't so bad after all. Controversion. You can't say that. You can't say that. They wear a really long time ago. I'm wondering if that's what I remember. Bots keep the lobsters cheap. I'm wondering how the economy in RuneScape would look if bots were like completely forbidden, like if they managed to like completely eradicate them. I'm wondering if it would be an uproar because everything would get so expensive, you know? Curious, curious. We're learning, we're learning. Stony, Iron Man win. Oh, good luck with that. Are you joking? It's hardcore Iron Man. You can't use bank. Iron Man is what? You lose everything when you perish? Sorry, I'm probably standing on everyone right now. I feel like it would probably like been working on a mech and AC6 for whatever you get on it. Ultimate Iron Man, no bank, hardcore, lose stats when that. Yeah. Are you serious? Do you know how much money I've made today? That's 20 million. No way I've been given 20 million. Hello? Don't people like spend like actual real-world currency to get this kind of going? Gold and coin together is going just like you should know. I'm putting this in the bank. Wait, you said there was a bank up here. Hold on. Hold on, mommy's going to the bank. She'll be back in a second. There's a bank up here? Is that one of these buildings? That looks like a ruined building. Oh, I'm getting scared. I hope I don't get attacked. You have what level are you people? Identify yourselves. Okay, no, I must be off of it. Oh, wait, wait, I see banker booth. We found it. We're finally in Edgeville. This is where I was born. Right, let's get this money nice and safe and tidy in here because oh my gosh. Hey, leather gloves. Can I put that on? Is that going to like add to my defense? Oh my gosh, leather gloves. That's what I needed. Oh, I'll check it out. Oh my god, I'm starting. Whoa, that's right. Whoa, the bend of my arm is amazing. We did it. We did it. All right, let me come back briefly. No, don't cry. Don't cry. Look over and you're crying. No, don't cry. I'm right here. I'm just stunning on the bank because I'm really scared. I didn't even know there was a freaking thing up there. Well, now I know there's a bank up there. I am expanding my runescape knowledge. Wow, okay, okay, we're here. I think I might need to... Can I get level 51? Whoa, wait a minute. Can I even cook these? Can I cook swordfish? Oh, I can. What did they get? Oh, burnt it. 140. It says I have to cook 56 swordfish to already level up again. Wait, it's taking down two? It's just 50. It's literally going down by two. 48. 47. Wait, what? I'm going crazy. Is that a chef hat? It is. It's a golden chef hat and a golden apron. A refling literally gave me it. Oh, I just started doing something. You should be able to buy enough materials for 99 cooking with five million coins alone. I've got, well, I've got 20. We might as well go fletching while we're at it. Will we do crafting? Jeez. Not me becoming a runescape player overnight. Like a runescape skillar, sorry. Oh my goodness, that swordfish is insane. We're at 31. Yeah, it's like recalculating, as you guys see. It's trying to do the math, but oof. That's insane. How much is it on the ground? For swordfish, it's 4k for that lot. It just seems like a shame that I'm kind of wasting that vote. Oh, even more. Goodbye, those who have to go. Yes, please don't worry if you have to go now. I'm about to read in some mercy to give myself a vocal rest before I do ASMR, I believe, tomorrow. And then it's the sweet stream. Yes. So please don't worry if you have to go. I'm literally just cooking away an experience in swordfish XT. I sent for Scottish anime women. Thanks for something for me. I sent for replays. Unfathomable progress, honestly. Oh yeah, buy out those stats. Yeah, we're going to get it. Rest well, rest well. I also shrimped for her. Oh yeah, you shrimped for me because I'm a mesipish. I'm a sea animal, so you shrimped for me. And we're head banging away. I'll wait the ride. I'll ask Mercy to put bad jokes written all over your new clothes design. I'm so curious what she comes up with, like so, so curious. Oh my god, we're 110 KXP for cooking. That's just amazing. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. And there's more where it came from. Not going to lie, I'd be part of that army if I played RuneScape at all. Someone was like, oh yeah, start up a guild. And I'm like, I've never done it. I don't even know how to do it. Well, we'll just play as free agents, if you will. We're free agents. Free refling. We sent for each other a circling of scents, if you will. Shrimping hard. The amount of progress is only possible with an army of shrimps. My little shrimpers. Oh fine, I guess you are my little shrimpers. Don't guild members get XP boosts, do they? What for, like, raids? Like streams to help Algo. Watch Mercy and RuneScape schedule. Yeah! 51 on day one, 51. That is an insane progress. Insane. Day one, level 51. Bruh. Bruh. Bruh. And that's with doing, like, free quests and stuff together. I'm wondering if we, like, just, just, just, just, just sent it. But we just sent it. Wait, you're both doing swordfish as well? You guys said, nah, lobbies isn't enough. We've had enough of lobsters. You're gonna, you're gonna just sell them on? You're gonna sell them back into the, the grand exchange economy? We don't need sleep when we have, oh, I hope you guys are sleeping well. We got you, literally. I hope you guys are sleeping well. I've had a few days without sleeping. Okay, it's rough. I guess it's dangerous. Hydration check. It's 1pm. Uh, is Mercy on? Wait, hold on. I'm gonna need to make sure I'm redirecting. Hold on, Strony. Oh, no, no, no. No, Mercy. No, this future channel, I need the link. Nope, that was her yesterday stream. Don't be silly, Billy. What? Oh, she's not live yet. It's like, upcoming. Oh, don't wait, 100 and 0.
