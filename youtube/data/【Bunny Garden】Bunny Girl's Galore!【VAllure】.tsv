150000	180000	I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
180000	181820	bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
181820	182720	little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
182720	185640	little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
185640	188220	little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
188220	196400	of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little of
196400	201400	I feel like I'm moving five miles an hour.
201400	206400	I'm so tired.
206400	209400	How are you?
209400	211400	I'm not...
211400	215400	I'm not gonna lie to you.
215400	219400	At exactly four o'clock, I woke up from a nap,
219400	221400	walked over to my computer,
221400	225400	and pressed go live.
225400	229400	So I'm still waking up.
229400	237400	I'm waking up to ash and dust.
237400	238400	Okay.
238400	245400	Might be a little bit delirious.
245400	247400	Got my tea.
247400	250400	Ready to rumble.
250400	253400	I gotta remember who I am.
253400	259400	I also got an iPad stand.
259400	261400	Thank you for your support,
261400	263400	those who look at my throne and such.
263400	265400	And I was trying to set it up
265400	267400	so that I could use my iPad
267400	269400	almost like a third monitor and look at chat.
269400	271400	And it was working well,
271400	274400	except I could see it was so tiny
274400	276400	that I couldn't see anything.
276400	278400	And I'm like, oh, I'll have to lean forward
278400	282400	and squint my eyes to see what the frick I'm looking at.
282400	287400	Ugh.
287400	289400	What are you guys doing today?
289400	290400	How was...
290400	292400	Did you get double ASMR again
292400	301400	from Shtrone and Anise?
301400	302400	By the way,
302400	310400	is she be short for Shabilla?
310400	316400	I'm too tired to come up with a snarky remark to that.
316400	318400	Oh, no, I see the Tomb Raider.
318400	322400	I don't know where I am.
322400	324400	I've got two milk model kids.
324400	325400	Go.
325400	327400	Sick, but you're here.
327400	328400	I like...
328400	330400	Some of you guys might have saw me
330400	333400	I went to the doctors this morning
333400	340400	and like going out into the world
340400	343400	takes a lot out of me and interacting with people
343400	345400	because I kept getting turned around.
345400	347400	Like I kept accidentally going the wrong way
347400	349400	because my GPS was messing stuff up.
349400	351400	I was a little bit late
351400	353400	and then the office was taken forever.
353400	355400	And so I was just so tired
355400	356400	when I got home,
356400	358400	but then I had to do a bunch of other stuff
358400	359400	to prepare for stream.
359400	361400	And then like exactly 3.30,
361400	363400	I just fell asleep on the couch
363400	367400	and knocked out.
367400	370400	But we're here.
370400	374400	We are here.
374400	376400	She be being lost is kind of me.
376400	380400	I have no sense of direction.
380400	382400	I never know where I am.
382400	384400	Even in my town,
384400	386400	in my city that I've lived in
386400	389400	for my entire life, essentially,
389400	393400	I'm like, oh, which road do I take?
393400	398400	Where am I?
398400	400400	It's not a miracle I'm awake right now.
400400	402400	I did set an alarm,
402400	403400	but I'm like,
403400	405400	I know I needed to just like lay down for a bit
405400	408400	and just gain my bearings.
408400	411400	But I hope you guys enjoyed Tomb Raider
411400	416400	with Icy and then ASMR with Momay.
416400	419400	I am quite eepy.
419400	421400	I am waking up.
421400	423400	Don't worry, I'll wake up though.
423400	425400	I'm just like here.
425400	427400	I didn't fall asleep till like 3 a.m.
427400	429400	My whole sleep schedule is messed up
429400	433400	ever since I streamed so late.
433400	435400	Oh, a womb raider?
435400	437400	Oh my God.
437400	439400	I already made that joke.
439400	441400	I made the Ash and Dust joke.
441400	444400	The Imagine Dragons.
444400	447400	Oh, you like Imagine Dragons?
447400	449400	Well, imagine me dragging these nuts
449400	451400	across your face.
451400	455400	Got him.
455400	457400	I forget to put my ooloo mouth on.
457400	463400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
463400	464400	I'm pretty good.
464400	468400	I'm pretty, I'm pretty, I'm pretty, uh,
468400	471400	I'm as, I'm as smart as a whip
471400	473400	that doesn't make any sense.
473400	476400	But yeah, I have no idea what this game is about.
476400	480400	Um, I know like it might be a visual novel.
480400	482400	I went in for like a second
482400	484400	and I saw that it was voice acted.
484400	485400	So I turned off the voices.
485400	488400	I'll be voice at voicing.
488400	490400	See the characters today.
490400	493400	And you guys can vote in the voices.
493400	495400	It's about bunny girls.
495400	496400	Yeah.
496400	498400	Like I haven't watched any gameplay.
498400	501400	Haven't read anything about it.
501400	504400	I know it was a flavor of the month game
504400	506400	for a very, for a little bit.
506400	508400	I'm like, okay, I'll play it.
508400	510400	Um, so we'll see.
510400	512400	We'll see.
512400	513400	Yawns and finds.
513400	515400	I'm surrounded by bunny girls.
515400	517400	I see this as an absolute win.
517400	518400	Okay.
518400	520400	I'm going to love it.
520400	522400	I also went in just in case
522400	525400	because like when I went to purchase the game
525400	528400	I was like, oh wait, I hope there's not like surprise
528400	530400	things that need to be censored.
530400	532400	So I went in and I double checked
532400	534400	because I didn't know if it was going to be like a Hoonipop situation.
534400	537400	You guys are all just like tricking me
537400	539400	and the whole world is against me tricking me.
539400	542400	Pretending that stuff is normal.
542400	546400	And then it's a crazy messed up game.
546400	549400	Um, yeah.
549400	550400	So I went in.
550400	552400	There wasn't any of that.
552400	554400	I was like, okay.
554400	557400	Although I did see like when I was looking at the steam page
557400	560400	for like a brief second when I was purchasing the game
560400	563400	just like people's screenshots
563400	566400	and they're all Ponzu shots.
566400	571400	So I'm like, what am I getting into?
571400	573400	Whoo.
573400	575400	Kushi jokes scare.
575400	576400	Exactly.
576400	579400	She doesn't know about the level that just opens.
579400	580400	What?
582400	584400	Excuse me.
584400	586400	It's just a lot of fan service.
586400	588400	It's on brand for me.
588400	591400	What color today?
591400	593400	What the fuck does that mean?
593400	595400	I'm white.
599400	603400	I did tease a possible brown toggle.
604400	607400	It's death less messed up than class of 09.
607400	612400	I didn't expect it to be messed up as much as class of 09.
612400	618400	Panty simulator with a side of alcohol.
618400	622400	You think they meant my ponzu?
622400	624400	I don't even remember.
624400	628400	Um, actually these are one of my favorite pairs.
628400	636400	It's like pastel rainbow-y lace with flowers on it.
636400	644400	And it's a thong.
644400	647400	And it's like has a lot of light blue.
647400	649400	It's nice to get my skin tone.
649400	653400	Anyways, usually we're nothing,
653400	655400	but I had to go out into the world today.
655400	660400	So I decided to, you know, bundle up before going on an excursion.
663400	664400	I actually fucking hate thongs.
664400	668400	I don't even know why I have so many, so many, so many.
668400	675400	I need to buy more underwear, like some like cheekies.
675400	682400	I accidentally, so like I, I'm a huge fan of like the Savage X Fenty,
682400	684400	like Rihanna's lingerie line.
684400	692400	And I forgot to fucking cancel my membership because they charge $59 a month for membership.
692400	695400	And you can skip the month, mind you.
695400	700400	And you can like save the money, but I swear to you, I thought I skipped the month.
700400	704400	And they charge me 60 bucks and I have to spend it on something.
704400	706400	And I'm like, well, it looks like I'm getting panties.
706400	708400	Looks like I'm getting panties.
708400	712400	They have great stuff, but I'm like, what the hell?
712400	717400	You know, I'm like, what the, what the actual fuck?
717400	719400	It's really high quality.
719400	720400	It's mostly what I wear.
720400	727400	Although I go to the pink store sometimes for a little something, something.
727400	729400	It's been 10 minutes and we're talking about pansos.
729400	730400	Yeah.
730400	732400	What did you expect?
732400	734400	Are you new here?
734400	735400	Wait a minute.
735400	740400	Who are you?
740400	743400	What does she be?
743400	744400	It's funny.
744400	752400	You guys have got me saying, erm, what the sigma and erm, what the scallop?
752400	761400	I, cause like when I, when my stream just wasn't loading, when I pressed start, I was like, erm,
761400	763400	what the, what the scallop?
763400	764400	Scallop.
764400	770400	And then I just like, audibly sighed out loud when I, when I heard what I said.
770400	774400	I'd be disappointed if people weren't still talking about random, at this point.
774400	776400	Random what?
776400	780400	You be, it's she be, it's me, it's she be.
780400	784400	Let's go and, yep.
784400	786400	I should put disclaimer.
786400	788400	I'm tired of shit.
788400	791400	I promise you I'm not drunk.
791400	792400	I'm just tired.
792400	800400	Usually like, listen, I made a big sacrifice streaming at the time that I do because around
800400	804400	this time is normally my nap time.
804400	807400	My family is notorious for napping.
807400	809400	My mom's the only one that can't.
809400	812400	My whole dad's side of the family are napping champions.
812400	822400	And from four to five, 30 prime nap time, something, I've like napped for like four hours before
822400	824400	and I still managed to get to sleep.
824400	826400	Is it depression?
826400	827400	I don't know.
827400	828400	Maybe she's born with it.
828400	834400	Maybe it's dysthymia.
834400	837400	She be, did you hear a Twitter room of the likes you can see?
837400	842400	I can still see everybody's likes because I have not updated my Twitter on my phone.
842400	845400	So you can't hide from me.
845400	847400	I know your secrets.
847400	848400	I know when you're awake.
848400	850400	I know when you've been bad or good.
850400	852400	So be bad.
852400	860400	For goodness sake.
860400	865400	What is your favorite kind of vegetable?
866400	868400	Is a potato a vegetable?
868400	870400	I really like potatoes.
870400	873400	Yeah, potatoes are vegetable.
873400	876400	Yeah, because it doesn't have like a seed.
876400	879400	I was like the dumbest thing I've ever said.
879400	881400	Is a potato a vegetable?
881400	884400	Oh my God.
884400	889400	It's funny because like technically zucchini is fruit.
889400	892400	Tomatoes are fruit.
892400	896400	Carrots are vegetable and like leafy greens are vegetables.
896400	899400	I really like all vegetables.
899400	903400	I'm like trying to think of a vegetable I don't like.
903400	905400	Like because I'll just eat anything.
905400	909400	I don't like, like, I like, I'm not a huge fan of arugula but I also eat it.
909400	911400	I really like spinach.
911400	913400	Yep.
913400	915400	I like Brussels sprouts.
915400	920400	Did you know they've actually engineered the bad flavor out of Brussels sprouts now?
920400	922400	My dad used to hate Brussels sprouts.
922400	928400	And then he like threw some in the air fryer and like with a little bit of oil, salt and pepper.
928400	932400	And they were like really tasty, nutty, almost like an artichoke heart.
932400	935400	And he's like, this is not like what they taste like back then.
935400	939400	And then we looked it up and did research and they actually engineered the shit out of there.
939400	940400	You hate bell peppers?
940400	943400	I love bell peppers.
943400	945400	Tomatoes are both vegetables and fruit.
945400	947400	Depends on which taxonomy you're using.
947400	949400	All right.
949400	952400	I don't know what that means, but Godspeed.
952400	953400	Listen, it smells so strong.
953400	959400	Yeah, they do still smell like, you know, the devil's asshole, but it is.
959400	961400	Spinach over lettuce for sale.
961400	962400	It's 100%.
962400	966400	I like butter lettuce because it's similar to spinach.
966400	969400	Or I'll use like butter lettuce for like a lettuce wrap.
969400	971400	Pretty good.
971400	973400	Why the fuck are we talking about vegetables?
973400	976400	You know how much, like, this is how, this is what I mean.
976400	977400	Somebody asked me a question.
977400	978400	I'm like, all right.
978400	981400	Talks 10 minutes explaining my answers.
990400	992400	But her lettuce, I barely know.
992400	993400	Shut up.
993400	994400	Get out of here.
994400	997400	I think canned steamed veggies turn people off.
997400	998400	Flavors are much better.
998400	999400	Baked in oil.
999400	1000400	Oh yeah, I agree with that.
1000400	1005400	I prefer, I'll eat steamed veggies because I like, I like steamed broccoli.
1005400	1006400	You're green beans.
1006400	1011400	I love green beans.
1011400	1012400	The best lounge chat.
1012400	1013400	Yeah.
1013400	1015400	Yeah, but be cotton bum.
1015400	1017400	That's a me.
1017400	1019400	Favorite breakfast.
1019400	1023400	You know, I love French toast.
1023400	1031400	French toast, I think was the first thing I learned how to cook after like learning how to like boil water and like make eggs.
1031400	1033400	I learned how to make French toast.
1033400	1035400	My mom taught me how to make French toast.
1035400	1040400	And it was so fun, that experience.
1040400	1043400	I burned everything, but you know, you live and you learn.
1043400	1045400	But yeah, I love, I love French toast.
1045400	1051400	I love the French toast, especially if it's Texas toast.
1051400	1053400	I don't know.
1053400	1063400	I'm speaking in a very poor French accent because I'm half asleep, but I am.
1063400	1065400	It is how it is.
1065400	1070400	No, I didn't, I can boil water.
1070400	1073400	Guys, I'm a very good cook.
1073400	1079400	When you're a kid and you're learning, you're not a very good cook.
1079400	1082400	It's called eggy bread in England.
1082400	1084400	That's fucking weird.
1084400	1085400	It's not a better name.
1085400	1087400	No, I don't like it.
1087400	1089400	Don't ask to doubt.
1089400	1100400	If you've looked at my all account, people have commended me on my cooking skills because I've sent, I've taken pictures and posted some food I have cooked.
1100400	1105400	French toast is called lost bread and friend.
1105400	1110400	I feel like there's a pun in there.
1110400	1115400	I just found out the healthy frozen protein waffles taste and smell like the Ben and Jerry's waffle cones.
1115400	1117400	Oh, okay.
1117400	1119400	But what brand?
1119400	1120400	I do love waffles though.
1120400	1127400	I used to fucking live off of, um, my mom said I used to love French toast sticks and ego waffles.
1127400	1134400	And then out of nostalgia the other day, I bought some ego waffles, but I don't have any syrup or butter.
1134400	1139400	So mistakes were made.
1139400	1140400	Waffles versus pancakes.
1140400	1142400	I prefer waffles.
1142400	1147400	Like I love, I really like pancakes, but like sometimes pancakes would be a bit too mushy for me.
1147400	1155400	And I like the, I prefer the texture of a waffle over a pancake and that like a waffle can hold syrup better.
1155400	1162400	Whereas a pancake, um, just becomes kind of just like soppy.
1162400	1164400	I've read French toast sticks.
1164400	1166400	It's pretty much just like French toast.
1166400	1169400	And you throw it in a toaster and you toast it in there.
1169400	1176400	Or like a confectionary confection oven or an oven.
1176400	1178400	My Belgian side tell me waffles.
1178400	1181400	Raw talking echoes.
1181400	1189400	I have done that before, but I prefer like I, I, I'm weird and I prefer to eat waffles with my hands.
1189400	1197400	Like my mom, uh, for some odd reason, because it's not like I was going to impress anybody or have a luncheon with the queen.
1197400	1204400	But she drilled etiquette in like proper, like using silverware into me.
1204400	1212400	Um, like which forks and knives to use, which like if you're at this sort of event, what this means and what that means.
1212400	1218400	Um, I think she just wanted me to be like proper, which isn't like a bad thing.
1218400	1223400	Like teaching me, you know, your child etiquette and being, you know, behaved at the dinner table.
1223400	1231400	Cause I was like, I remember, um, I would always have to say, like, can I be excused before I left the dinner table?
1231400	1234400	And I had, you know, all that stuff.
1234400	1239400	And so I remember like one parent when I was over somebody's house, I would just like, can I be excused?
1239400	1241400	And they're like, why are you asking?
1241400	1244400	And I'm like, cause I always have to ask.
1244400	1245400	Yeah.
1245400	1246400	Yeah.
1246400	1247400	Manors maketh.
1247400	1248400	She beat.
1248400	1249400	It's funny.
1249400	1253400	I was literally, I don't know why it popped in my head on the toilet, but I was randomly just sitting there.
1253400	1256400	I'm just like, manners maketh the man.
1256400	1259400	I didn't even watch Kingsman reach recently.
1259400	1260400	Actually, that's a lie.
1260400	1262400	I watched the Kingsman.
1262400	1265400	I didn't finish it because it was boring.
1265400	1269400	I got to the part past Rasputin.
1269400	1271400	Rasputin.
1271400	1272400	Poutine.
1272400	1273400	Rasputin now.
1273400	1276400	And I was like, all right, this is kind of weird.
1276400	1278400	And it's kind of boring.
1278400	1281400	I prefer the first Kingsman movies moving on.
1281400	1282400	And then I fell asleep.
1282400	1285400	And then I just never bothered to watch it again.
1285400	1290400	She'd be getting mad at her friend's house because they served over the wrong shoulder.
1290400	1293400	No, like, I don't even recall like a lot of that stuff anymore.
1293400	1298400	I remember I went to like a fancy restaurant with my parents.
1298400	1301400	And this is the type of restaurant where if you get crumbs on the table,
1301400	1309400	they come over and they have a little thing to take the crumbs off and they move them away.
1309400	1311400	And they have like the multiple silverware.
1311400	1317400	And it's like, that's like, my parents usually go there for their anniversary because it's a very like pricey place.
1317400	1323400	And I've been like sitting there and I'm like, fuck, which fork do I use for salad again?
1323400	1327400	I don't even, my mom's like that one.
1327400	1328400	And I'm like, oh, thanks.
1328400	1329400	Anyways.
1329400	1353400	I love doing that and just dance.
1353400	1355400	It's like probably my favorite song to do in just dance.
1355400	1360400	Besides, I think was I like that by Richard.
1360400	1361400	Hold on.
1361400	1376400	I like that just dance by the talk by the elect.
1376400	1384400	Was it the toxic revenge or what the fuck toxic Avenger?
1384400	1385400	Am I tripping?
1385400	1401400	I could have sworn I like that by toxic Avenger was in just dance.
1401400	1413400	I'm getting as toxic from Britney Spears.
1413400	1415400	I'm very frustrated.
1415400	1416400	Whatever.
1416400	1419400	I'm experiencing a Mandela effect for a moment.
1419400	1423400	It's going to beat Saber.
1423400	1428400	I definitely want to like if when they get a 3D model, 100% want to do just dance.
1428400	1433400	I'm like, I need to get back into like dance and shape.
1433400	1435400	I'm just like a miss.
1435400	1440400	I'm just atrophying in my chair.
1440400	1441400	I think you had a cool dream.
1441400	1443400	Toxic Avenger is a movie.
1443400	1444400	No.
1444400	1446400	I think your thumbnail got restricted.
1446400	1448400	Are you fucking serious?
1448400	1455400	You know, I noticed that when I was on my iPad, I was just like, wait a second.
1455400	1457400	Why is it like grayed out?
1457400	1461400	Like, was that like the three dots thing?
1461400	1467400	I didn't know what that meant, though, but that makes a lot more sense then.
1467400	1468400	I'll fix it later.
1468400	1472400	I blame my manager.
1472400	1476400	They approve the thumbnail.
1476400	1478400	Throw some boobs in the thumbnail.
1478400	1481400	Put some boobs in the thumbnail, bitch.
1481400	1482400	Put some boobs.
1482400	1487400	Check out Azura's cover of boobs in the thumbnail.
1487400	1488400	I thought it was lag.
1488400	1490400	I thought the gray was an artistic choice.
1490400	1495400	It's gray in the homepage.
1495400	1514400	Just more reminders that I'm probably never going to be monetized.
1514400	1523400	Sometimes I fall asleep and I hear my BGM in my ears.
1523400	1532400	I can't tell if I like it or not.
1532400	1535400	Wake up.
1535400	1536400	I need a non-outfit.
1536400	1543400	I was thinking about adding one of those to throw in one of those VTuber outfits that
1543400	1547400	I've been using for streams and stuff.
1547400	1550400	I have to get rid of this VOD based on what happened with other streamers.
1550400	1551400	Why?
1551400	1554400	What happened to their VODs?
1554400	1558400	Wait, I thought everyone got monetized and said, no, that's not true.
1558400	1562400	We applied for monetization all at the same time.
1562400	1565400	The majority of the other girls got it.
1565400	1567400	I'm still under review.
1567400	1575400	I'm mentally preparing myself to be disappointed in case it happens.
1575400	1576400	Serenity!
1576400	1580400	Manchibi would go so hard.
1580400	1582400	Does she know?
1582400	1584400	Do they know?
1584400	1589400	There was a priestess and a nun and another iteration.
1589400	1592400	Sorry, don't you usually stream around this time?
1592400	1596400	What are you doing, girl?
1596400	1603400	Serenity, I made you an call of the lamb and you tried to kill me.
1603400	1604400	What was it?
1604400	1608400	You tried spreading falsehoods about my cult, so I had to throw you in prison.
1608400	1610400	So you're currently in prison right now and call of the lamb.
1610400	1613400	I'm so sorry.
1613400	1615400	VOD before streaming even started.
1615400	1617400	What do you mean?
1617400	1619400	YouTube said no to bunny garden?
1619400	1622400	Explain.
1622400	1623400	Is there anything you can do?
1623400	1628400	I can reapply in a month.
1628400	1631400	That's where I belong in prison.
1631400	1633400	I'm getting lazy.
1633400	1640400	Yeah, it would just be a month of I'd have to reapply.
1640400	1642400	Do I have a hat?
1642400	1644400	No.
1644400	1646400	What?
1646400	1647400	What's that?
1647400	1648400	A hat?
1648400	1650400	A crazy, funky, junky hat?
1650400	1651400	Ever slept?
1651400	1652400	Hair and tidy?
1652400	1654400	Oh, she looks like here at nightly.
1654400	1655400	We've been there.
1655400	1656400	We've done that.
1656400	1660400	We see right through your funky hat.
1660400	1663400	Do you know where that's from?
1663400	1666400	I should be fine as long as you skip over the in-game ASMR.
1666400	1669400	Really?
1669400	1672400	Why don't I have a hat?
1672400	1673400	Was that from Hannah Montana?
1673400	1675400	Close.
1675400	1681400	It's from another show around that time.
1681400	1684400	Why did we go show ago?
1684400	1686400	Does that mean you're definitely not going to get me?
1686400	1688400	Guys, I have no idea.
1688400	1689400	I have no idea.
1689400	1701400	Maybe the YouTube coon will smile upon me and bless me with monetization.
1701400	1702400	But who knows?
1702400	1704400	If not, it is what it is.
1704400	1708400	You can always support me on Patreon even if you don't want to consume the content.
1708400	1711400	Or you can always support me through stream loads.
1711400	1713400	Or you can check out my merch.
1713400	1716400	It is not the end of the world.
1716400	1720400	Wizards of Waverly Place, you got it!
1720400	1722400	I need a do-in-your-mom hat.
1722400	1723400	That's pretty good.
1723400	1725400	That's pretty good.
1725400	1727400	I would actually probably get that.
1727400	1730400	Somebody said, uh,
1730400	1736400	Man, I love fishing hat.
1736400	1739400	I'm not worried about...
1739400	1741400	She likes to yap just as much as me.
1741400	1744400	Like mother like daughter.
1744400	1746400	Donate my imaginary memory.
1746400	1748400	I'd be like, alright.
1748400	1751400	Pay your tithes every month.
1751400	1754400	And just pretend your name is green.
1754400	1756400	No member strips.
1756400	1757400	Memberships.
1757400	1759400	Membership streams though.
1759400	1762400	Um, well, yeah, I'm not...
1762400	1763400	I'm not too worried.
1763400	1765400	I'm kind of just like dooming about it.
1765400	1767400	Just like mentally.
1767400	1773400	Because you know, what is that thing that like Wednesday Adam says?
1773400	1777400	If you expect the worst, you can't be disappointed or some shit.
1777400	1779400	But like, yeah.
1779400	1780400	Member strips.
1780400	1785400	Member strips is where you get chicken strips sent to you once a month in the mail.
1785400	1789400	And the box that they come in has my face stamped at them.
1789400	1795400	But it's like, you know that one gif of like a chicken pole dancing?
1795400	1796400	Or it's like a rabbit?
1796400	1797400	I don't know.
1797400	1798400	Just pretend it's a chicken.
1798400	1800400	So it's a chicken pole dancing.
1800400	1802400	And that's like the way my face is on the chicken.
1802400	1805400	And then you get chicken strips from Sheebie.
1805400	1807400	That's chicken member strips.
1807400	1808400	Yep.
1808400	1809400	They good.
1809400	1810400	They're the best.
1810400	1811400	Nothing.
1811400	1815400	Nothing but the best for my baby girls.
1815400	1817400	Thank you.
1817400	1822400	Thank you, Harilit.
1822400	1823400	Full de tans.
1823400	1824400	Full de tans.
1824400	1825400	Full de tans.
1825400	1826400	Thank you.
1826400	1829400	It didn't pop up because I had muted my desktop audio.
1829400	1831400	I forgot to turn it back on.
1831400	1834400	But thank you, Harilit.
1834400	1839400	But don't, yeah, don't worry about me.
1839400	1844400	It's mostly frustrating because I had like, I want to do like the membership streams that
1844400	1847400	I have in mind.
1847400	1850400	My face, no, my face isn't on the strips.
1850400	1858400	It's on the box that holds the strips, unless you would prefer both.
1858400	1861400	We might do that.
1861400	1862400	Ow.
1862400	1867400	I just like hit myself with a nipple really hard.
1867400	1868400	Excuse me.
1868400	1871400	That was a sleepy burp.
1871400	1875400	All right.
1875400	1878400	Go, ABGM.
1878400	1880400	It's time to play.
1880400	1882400	Bup, bup, bup, bup.
1882400	1883400	Body Gordon.
1883400	1885400	Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.
1885400	1893400	Where the fuck is it?
1893400	1896400	Can I kiss the boo boo to help?
1896400	1907400	You know, can I be, can I be, can I be TMI for a second?
1907400	1909400	So mine are pierced.
1909400	1913400	And so sometimes I just get like hooked on stuff.
1913400	1918400	Or I'm just like bump into something.
1918400	1927400	And that's like the worst thing.
1927400	1929400	I don't know.
1929400	1931400	No, no, I'm not ripping them.
1931400	1938400	They're not, my nipples aren't getting ripped off guys.
1938400	1953400	It's more, it's like imagine, like, if it, like, you know, I don't know if it's like this at all because I don't have balls, but imagine you're going to zip up your pants and like a little bit of your ball gets like caught in the zipper.
1953400	1957400	It's like a little bit, it's like a little less than that.
1957400	1959400	That's what I'm assuming.
1959400	1966400	But imagine that on your chest.
1966400	1969400	It was like, you know, like, I'm not going to elaborate.
1969400	1980400	Anyways, I was just fucking loud.
1980400	1982400	I've had it before it hurts.
1982400	1983400	Ouch.
1983400	1985400	You get in the hospital when you get caught in your zipper.
1985400	1989400	Well, I mean, I didn't mean like if you're caught caught, like you can't get out.
1989400	1993400	I mean, like, when you kind of zip it up and just like pinches you a little bit.
1993400	1994400	Like, because I'm like, I've done that.
1994400	2000400	I've done that to my pussy lip before and I was like, I'm just like, like, girl.
2000400	2004400	And then I'm just like, quickly.
2004400	2007400	Okay, maybe it's not as bad as that.
2007400	2008400	That's unimaginable.
2008400	2011400	You guys are such fucking babies.
2011400	2015400	You nipple piercings hurt once they're there.
2015400	2017400	For the first like couple months.
2017400	2020400	Yes, they're pretty tender.
2020400	2023400	I remember I went so I went with Salem, who I talk about often.
2023400	2025400	She we had only known each other for a week.
2025400	2029400	Mind you, I'm like, hey, do you want to come with me and watch me get my nipples pierced?
2029400	2031400	And she's just like, oh my God, yes, sure.
2031400	2033400	Because I want to walk like I want to get them done too.
2033400	2035400	And I'm like, okay, let's go.
2035400	2038400	And we go there.
2038400	2043400	First one goes in and I'm like, ow, that really hurt.
2043400	2048400	And I look over and look at Salem's face and her face is like completely mortified.
2049400	2060400	And then the piercer was telling me so usually the adrenaline kicks in only for the first one and then kind of tapers off for the second one.
2060400	2062400	So a lot of people don't get the second one done.
2062400	2063400	I'm like, fuck it.
2063400	2064400	Put the second one through.
2064400	2067400	And they did that and it hurt worse.
2067400	2069400	And I was like, ah.
2069400	2075400	And then I couldn't like put anything against my chest for like a month.
2076400	2079400	I went right back to work.
2079400	2083400	Because there was a piercing place in the mall and I just went back to work.
2083400	2084400	I went on my lunch break.
2084400	2086400	I'm like, fuck it.
2086400	2088400	I'm a badass bitch.
2092400	2094400	I just have barbells.
2097400	2100400	But they look cute in a shirt and stuff.
2100400	2103400	I know some people don't like them.
2103400	2109400	But like, I know Strawny's model has them.
2109400	2113400	My model doesn't have it though.
2113400	2116400	But it would be on brand for me to have it.
2116400	2120400	But like, I have a high pain tolerance.
2120400	2121400	Strawny's model.
2121400	2122400	Don't worry about it.
2122400	2124400	Hi, mom.
2124400	2125400	Hi, mom.

2140400	2143400	So I was normal for the first about 30 minutes and now we're not normal.
2145400	2148400	I didn't read you, but you should have read it.
2152400	2156400	Can you guys hear Raina singing the song of her people in the background?
2159400	2162400	She be, Strawny is she be Donnie Dami mommy?
2162400	2163400	No.
2164400	2166400	She might be my mother.
2167400	2169400	She doesn't Dami though.
2177400	2178400	Normal.
2178400	2179400	What about?
2180400	2182400	I already forgot what I was talking about.
2183400	2186400	But um, yeah, I have a high pain tolerance.
2186400	2189400	So she doesn't hurt me.
2190400	2191400	Not sorry.
2191400	2192400	She was a doll.
2192400	2193400	It's too soft.
2193400	2195400	She's I am also dollar.
2195400	2196400	Yeah.
2196400	2197400	I'm.
2197400	2199400	Am I the tallest girl?
2200400	2201400	Or is there?
2201400	2202400	I might be the tallest girl.
2202400	2203400	No.
2203400	2205400	It's a tallest girl.
2205400	2206400	Am I the tallest girl out of all?
2206400	2208400	I can't remember.
2209400	2212400	Strawny is a freaking small ass chick.
2212400	2214400	Let me tell you that though.
2214400	2216400	I could probably rest my arm on her head.
2222400	2224400	Why did I choose this game?
2224400	2226400	Because I had the word bunny in it.
2226400	2229400	And I wanted to play something bunny related.
2230400	2232400	I'll take a seat.
2233400	2236400	Well, no, I meant like like actual heights.
2236400	2239400	Like I meant like RTX model heights.
2239400	2240400	Out of normal heights.
2240400	2241400	Yes.
2241400	2244400	Is there is the tallest because she could fucking turn into a sky scraper.
2244400	2246400	I'm just six feet in heels.
2246400	2251400	I'm normally like five, six in my little.
2251400	2253400	Wait, am I five, six in heels?
2253400	2254400	Does that mean I'm.
2255400	2261400	I'm just thinking because if I'm 168 centimeters while I'm wearing my red heels.
2261400	2267400	Does that mean I'm actually like five, four whole is my life a lie?
2270400	2271400	Holy.
2273400	2276400	You're the tallest girl since there are cheats because he's a giant.
2276400	2277400	That's true.
2277400	2278400	She just like stays tall.
2278400	2280400	I'm getting bullied for my height.
2280400	2281400	I could sell.
2285400	2288400	Because normally because normally I'm like I'm five, eight, five, nine.
2290400	2291400	But.
2294400	2297400	2D she be is five, six.
2298400	2300400	But I don't know if that's with heels or without heels.
2300400	2301400	So.
2302400	2303400	Design Papa.
2303400	2309400	I'm going to need you to get on that and give me my canonical canon con height.
2310400	2311400	Yep.
2311400	2312400	Words.

2318400	2319400	Absolute.
2320400	2322400	Absolute short stack.
2322400	2323400	I'm not.
2323400	2328400	I'm taller than the majority of people I interact with on a daily basis.
2328400	2330400	Yes, it's mostly my cats.
2330400	2334400	But when I go back to work, I am literally taller than so many fucking people.
2336400	2338400	She be who is the ebony of this game?
2338400	2340400	You know, the Draco living golf.
2340400	2342400	Who cuts because I don't know.
2342400	2343400	I don't know.
2343400	2350400	Maybe the girl with the black hair who kind of looks like that one chick from device.
2350400	2351400	Halo device.
2353400	2355400	That sounds so bad.
2359400	2363400	I just, I just literally noticed right now that she kind of like looks like the girl from device.
2366400	2367400	Hello from honey pop.
2367400	2368400	Hey, quick question.
2368400	2369400	Why is your thumbnail gray?
2369400	2371400	I think my thumbnail was nuked.
2374400	2375400	Yeah.
2376400	2377400	Yeah.
2377400	2378400	So.
2379400	2381400	Hey, scrawny, can you tell?
2381400	2388400	Uh, manager to make me another thumbnail with a cover up so I can put that up instead.
2388400	2390400	Because it got yanked.
2390400	2392400	Thank you, mom.
2392400	2393400	I love you, mom.
2393400	2395400	You're the best, mom.
2395400	2398400	Are you firing peeler allegation?
2398400	2399400	Please do not make it.
2399400	2400400	Cock color.
2401400	2402400	Yeah, my thumbnail guy.
2402400	2403400	Yep.
2403400	2404400	Zippity-doodle.
2404400	2405400	Zippity-dade.
2406400	2408400	It wasn't even bad.
2408400	2415400	It was literally me standing almost like I was in a fucking t-pose because I did an emote for my face for the thumbnail.
2415400	2418400	So I'm just kind of just like standing there.
2418400	2421400	It was literally that I will show you what it was.
2421400	2422400	Hold on.
2422400	2424400	It was literally me going like this.
2427400	2428400	No, not even with that.
2428400	2429400	Just like.
2432400	2434400	That's why I got it nuked.
2434400	2436400	My thumbnails might all get yanked.
2436400	2439400	I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.
2440400	2446400	I guess I just have to become flat, you know, because flat's justice and all.
2446400	2449400	Looks deviously at mother.
2449400	2451400	Maybe I just have to become cute and funny.
2451400	2453400	Looks deviously at mother.
2458400	2460400	It shows up in some fever blinds.
2460400	2462400	Yeah, I noticed that.
2465400	2467400	I'd be too powerful with that.
2467400	2468400	You're right, you're right.
2470400	2472400	Do they know?
2472400	2474400	They're gonna know.
2474400	2476400	They're not gonna know.
2480400	2482400	I'm already cute and funny.
2482400	2484400	You know what is awesome?
2484400	2490400	So I ordered some stuff from Amazon for my ASMR this week.
2490400	2492400	What's today?
2492400	2495400	Wednesday to March, Thursday, Power Wash collab.
2495400	2498400	I don't remember what day my own ASMR stream is.
2498400	2505400	But I got like Pop Rocks for a really cool trigger.
2505400	2507400	And they taste really good too.

2508400	2510400	Well, I'm finishing it up right now.
2517400	2519400	I don't know.

2526400	2528400	Tell me in the news.
2532400	2533400	Did you already do Pop Rocks?
2533400	2535400	I feel like you did.
2540400	2543400	Yeah, I feel like it's really nice.
2543400	2544400	She did it with her feet sweat.
2544400	2546400	Oh, I didn't know that part.
2549400	2551400	Yeah, I ordered it a couple days ago.
2551400	2552400	They finally came in.
2552400	2554400	Thank you, mother.
2558400	2560400	What the fuck is this?
2564400	2565400	Oh my God.
2565400	2567400	Why are you so fucking precious?
2567400	2569400	I can't.

2573400	2575400	Here you go.

2579400	2582400	Oh my, let me fix that.
2582400	2588400	And it's just a fucking screenshot of me being live right now.
2588400	2590400	Oh, I can't.
2590400	2592400	You're too good for this earth.
2592400	2595400	Oh my God, let me just.
2595400	2597400	I'm keeping this thumbnail.
2597400	2600400	I'm just straight keeping it.
2600400	2606400	Even if they come back around to fix it.
2606400	2608400	I'm just, I'm keeping this one up.
2614400	2618400	Graphic design is my passion.
2618400	2620400	It's Strani's passion, I should say.
2629400	2632400	I can picture, I can picture your silly little face.
2632400	2635400	Go he, he, he, he, in Scottish just.
2642400	2644400	Hope you got, can you guys see it?
2644400	2645400	Your work.

2656400	2658400	Anyways games.
2662400	2666280	Am I a dude?
2666280	2667280	This loud?
2667280	2668280	Holy fuck.
2668280	2677160	That's a fucking loud.
2677160	2678800	It's perfect.
2678800	2685880	Or the thumbnail is perfect.
2685880	2688760	Is the sound fine?
2688760	2693080	Bye, strongy.
2693080	2714080	Thank you for stopping by and making me an amazing thumbnail.
2714080	2725080	Oh wait, can I go back?
2725080	2727760	I got 15k again in my pocket.
2727760	2732960	Isn't that like a hundred and fifty bucks or something?
2732960	2733960	You know that face?
2733960	2740760	Onion Makes and Spikes family that got me and that gives me, yes, exactly that one.
2740760	2748760	Alright, I'm trying to think of a voice.
2748760	2751840	My company fired me.
2751840	2752840	It is what it is.
2752840	2755560	It's not the first time it's happened.
2755560	2758280	I'm thankful they hired me in the first place.
2758280	2761480	I have nothing but gratitude for the company.
2761480	2764040	My boss even cried for me when they fired me.
2764040	2767160	He said, I'm sorry I couldn't help you out.
2767160	2771360	They told me that this company isn't the right fit for me and that there are other places
2771360	2774480	where I could shine.
2774480	2776880	It was nice of them to say that.
2776880	2778920	Is there really somewhere out there?
2778920	2782680	Some place that would take in a fool like me?
2782680	2784520	Haito-kun?
2784520	2788160	Even if I could get another job somewhere else, I would just mess everything up for
2788160	2791560	the people there.
2791560	2793440	Ellipses.
2793440	2796400	Maybe my life ellipses is done for.
2796400	2799240	I didn't even think it has started.
2799240	2800240	Ellipses.
2800240	2806240	It's only been a minute in and I'm thinking about killing myself.
2806240	2810640	Time to drink my problems.
2810640	2812400	I guess he's the goth one.
2812400	2813400	He's ebony.
2813400	2824200	I'm pretty sure there's a barb somewhere in this building.
2825200	2827200	Oh, is she 3D?
2827200	2830200	Holy shit.
2830200	2839200	You just feel so cool in my mouth.
2839200	2847200	What sort of voice should we she have?
2847200	2860200	We're eating pop rocks.
2860200	2862200	Childhood friend voice?
2862200	2863200	Givers?
2863200	2868200	Okay, I'm just gonna put it to a poll.
2868200	2872200	I like how you call it like an Emmy voice when you just want me to do a lulley voice.
2872200	2900200	No, I guess just don't say that.
2900200	2903200	Emmy sounds less gross.
2903200	2906200	Connie voice.
2906200	2911200	Give her a lisp.
2911200	2914200	There's lollibabas.
2914200	2915200	Hope by lollies.
2915200	2917200	Aren't the girls voice in JP?
2917200	2920200	Yeah, but I'm fucking doing the voices.
2920200	2924200	Why would I?
2924200	2930200	Any time I'm reading a visual novel, I'm the one doing the voices.
2930200	2937200	My only excuse to do funny voices because the other times I do it when I'm just playing games, it doesn't make any fucking sense.
2937200	2940200	Okay?
2940200	2944200	That wasn't good.
2944200	2949200	Cute and funny voice, Scottish, really condescending childhood friend.
2949200	2959200	Or just wolf like a dog.
2959200	2964200	I'll just do like deep voice.
2964200	2970200	I don't know what that would be, but yeah.
2971200	2980200	Have fun.
2980200	2987200	We have three other, two other girls to voice.
2987200	2990200	Six out of, yeah, no, Toma knows I can do better.
2990200	2995200	Speaking of which, me and Toma have a collab coming up next week.
2995200	3002200	Do little Pokemon smash her face.
3002200	3006200	She is bringing out one of her characters, Trinket.
3006200	3012200	I'm very excited.
3012200	3017200	It'll be so good.
3017200	3024200	That's my cat.
3025200	3031200	She's going to say smash a low-punny.
3031200	3034200	Literally someone mentioned this a couple of streams ago.
3034200	3038200	I literally was just like, oh, I would do horrible things so low-punny.
3038200	3043200	I literally said that.
3043200	3045200	Was that the mom I have a toy?
3045200	3047200	Yeah, she has her fluffy ball.
3047200	3049200	She likes to take it into the bathroom.
3049200	3051200	She likes to scream in the bathtub.
3051200	3053200	Don't ask me why she does that.
3053200	3055200	I call it singing the song of her people.
3055200	3058200	She's just letting the other cats know that she has caught something.
3058200	3064200	It's funny because Boomi and Fia don't do that.
3064200	3068200	But they'll go and run to her, all concerned.
3068200	3073200	Mr. Mime.
3073200	3078200	I'll save it for the collab.
3078200	3080200	Please check out Toma.
3080200	3088200	I have a lot of collabs next week.
3088200	3099200	Can you combine option two and three?
3099200	3103200	Scottish cute and funny boys.
3103200	3110200	I'm looking at you and I'm thinking that you're a bloody wanker.
3110200	3116200	No, that's not gonna... that's hard, actually.
3116200	3119200	I'm staring at you.
3119200	3123200	I'm looking at you.
3123200	3125200	Raina, what the fuck are you doing?
3125200	3128200	I don't know what my cat is doing.
3128200	3135200	Scotland Freda.
3135200	3139200	This calypso is mean enough.
3139200	3144200	All right, but I'm sorry condescending childhood friend one.
3144200	3146200	Raina, please.
3146200	3151200	Mommy is straight. Raina.
3151200	3152200	Okay, I'm sorry.
3152200	3159200	Go tell her that she's did a good job. Hold on.
3159200	3162200	Hi.
3162200	3187200	You're very full of energy today, huh?
3188200	3193200	Oh, my God.
3200200	3204200	She prays like that.
3204200	3206200	Raina wants to collab.
3206200	3208200	Give her a mic.
3208200	3212200	Me as a podcast with Raina.
3212200	3215200	Stare.
3215200	3218200	I'm sorry.
3218200	3223200	Just throwing out a guess here, but did something bad happen to you?
3223200	3227200	It's like it has a twinge of alley girl, you know?
3227200	3234200	That's why you're trying to drink and forget everything or...
3234200	3238200	Sorry, excuse me.
3238200	3243200	Are you trying to get me to go to your hostess club?
3243200	3245200	Yeah, you're wrong.
3245200	3252200	You just happened to catch my eye before I got to work.
3252200	3255200	I'm feeling when I come on stream to mess with you.
3255200	3258200	You come on stream to mess with me?
3258200	3259200	I ain't even reading the rest of that.
3259200	3269200	Maud's paying him by his piggy toes from the ceiling,
3269200	3276200	spinning him around while you waterboard him.
3276200	3284200	All right. Thank you.
3284200	3290200	You look so tired as if your life is over.
3290200	3293200	Oh, this is like really quiet.
3293200	3306200	I put the BGM too quiet, I think.
3306200	3315200	This is fucking loud.
3315200	3333200	You look tired. I can fix that.
3333200	3343200	Have you ever seen the grapefruit technique?
3343200	3347200	My soul?
3347200	3349200	The customers in my bar?
3349200	3353200	I don't need to do anything for people to come to Wonderland.
3353200	3354200	The classic technique.
3354200	3356200	Just look up the grapefruit technique.
3356200	3359200	Make sure you're alone though and that your headphones are in.
3359200	3364200	So, you know, it's a beautiful black woman holding a grapefruit
3364200	3366200	and she goes over her technique.
3366200	3368200	So highly recommend it.
3368200	3380200	Ladies that are watching.
3380200	3383200	I was in a group when I saw the O.
3383200	3386200	Bless your heart.
3386200	3390200	Very great technique. 10 out of 10.
3390200	3393200	It's nice to see that my male viewers are very progressive
3393200	3398200	in using it as well. Good job, guys.
3398200	3405200	Happy Pride.
3405200	3407200	You might be right.
3407200	3409200	I knew it. Yes.
3409200	3413200	Oh, sorry. This isn't something to be happy about.
3413200	3417200	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hit it right on the bullseye.
3417200	3420200	It's so sad to think your life is over.
3420200	3423200	Yeah, I know.
3423200	3425200	What should I do?
3425200	3427200	Oh, sorry, I'm thinking.
3427200	3429200	What should I do if I invite him in?
3429200	3431200	Then I'll really become a tout.
3431200	3433200	What the fuck does that mean?
3433200	3437200	But I can't leave someone so hurt out in the cold.
3437200	3439200	Girl, what are you talking about?
3439200	3441200	Why are you just talking?
3441200	3444200	I'm right here. I can hear what you're fucking saying.
3444200	3446200	Got it. You don't have to come into the shop.
3446200	3448200	You can just have a sneak peek.
3448200	3450200	That's right.
3450200	3453200	I don't know what the fuck is going on.
3453200	3457200	The truth is, I work here.
3457200	3459200	Hello?
3459200	3462200	One of those is actually me.
3462200	3465200	The girl with the black bunny ears, they both fucking have them.
3465200	3467200	The girl in the yellow, she's me.
3467200	3469200	She's just me.
3474200	3477200	Make sure if you ever have grapefruit,
3477200	3480200	you shouldn't eat grapefruit while you're taking medication.
3480200	3482200	It's not safe.
3482200	3487200	Tip from your neighborhood.
3487200	3489200	Dom.
3489200	3491200	No.
3495200	3497200	Literally human shit.
3497200	3499200	No.
3501200	3504200	I didn't know they opened this kind of bar here.
3504200	3507200	It's someplace where I can drink with girls.
3507200	3510200	I've never been in a shop like this before.
3510200	3512200	It's clean and the girls are cute.
3512200	3516200	I've only been to the really disgusting fucked up ones
3516200	3518200	where the girls look like they have track marks up their arms.
3518200	3522200	And have been huffing powder for hours.
3522200	3524200	Excuse me, what are you saying?
3524200	3527200	Sorry, I got off on a tangent.
3527200	3530200	I guess I'll give it a try.
3530200	3534200	Ah, you're gonna get me in trouble, sir.
3534200	3536200	Huh, so I can't come in?
3536200	3540200	Why the fuck did you show me this if I can't come in?
3540200	3542200	That's all for today.
3542200	3544200	I'll just give you a glimpse.
3544200	3546200	If you come inside, then I'm really a tout.
3546200	3550200	What the fuck is a tout?
3550200	3557200	I give you the right to come to the shop as a customer.
3557200	3560200	Since when the fuck do you give me the right to go to a bar
3560200	3563200	where I pay money to hang out with you?
3563200	3566200	Anyways, whenever you're interested, I'll be waiting for you to come.
3566200	3569200	Why did you just ignore me?
3569200	3574200	You're so sincere.
3574200	3576200	Don't forget, your life isn't over.
3576200	3577200	You'll be okay.
3577200	3579200	I know you will.
3579200	3581200	I can tell in your eyes.
3581200	3585200	So please, hand over your wallet.
3585200	3586200	Huh?
3586200	3588200	I was just kidding.
3588200	3591200	Right now, even if it was small, I know you smiled.
3591200	3593200	My dick's not small.
3593200	3595200	That means you're not done yet.
3595200	3598200	Thanks, I guess, fucking bitch.
3598200	3601200	I'll be here at the shop waiting for you.
3601200	3603200	I'm looking forward to the next time we can see each other
3603200	3606200	and I can rinse your wallet.
3606200	3609200	Alright, I'll let you go.
3609200	3610200	What the fuck was her deal?
3610200	3611200	She was so strange.
3611200	3613200	She doesn't even know me.
3613200	3616200	But I guess I do feel a little better.
3616200	3620200	Kind of tinted in my pants, seeing that girl bent over that table.
3620200	3622200	I'm such a simple guy.
3622200	3624200	Now, I don't know...
3624200	3630200	I'm making myself fucking laugh.
3630200	3634200	Now, I don't know if I really want to get drunk and forget everything.
3634200	3639200	I just want to go home.
3639200	3644200	Ellipses.
3644200	3646200	What the fuck is all night?
3646200	3652200	I thought that was a weird version of the girl's poster.
3652200	3655200	My life isn't over, huh?
3655200	3657200	Ellipses.
3657200	3658200	No way.
3658200	3661200	Why would I take something a girl said to me seriously
3661200	3664200	when I don't even know her name?
3664200	3666200	I don't even remember what her face looks like.
3666200	3668200	I was just staring at her tits.
3668200	3673200	She didn't seem to be joking around, but, you know, her tits.
3673200	3675200	Ellipses.
3675200	3678200	I mean, it's not like anyone has ever told me that my life is done.
3678200	3683200	Besides me, I contemplated suicide probably about 30 minutes ago.
3683200	3687200	I'm the only one who thinks that if I don't finish it myself,
3687200	3690200	maybe it's still possible to start again.
3690200	3696200	Seriously, starts masturbating.
3696200	3699200	Tout, a person soliciting customers.
3699200	3703200	Oh.
3703200	3710200	Attempt to sell something typically by pestering people in aggressive or bold manner.
3710200	3711200	That doesn't make any fucking...
3711200	3713200	She wasn't even being aggressive, though.
3713200	3721200	Why?
3721200	3723200	Oh, hello.
3723200	3725200	I'm sorry for calling you without notice.
3725200	3729200	You know how you were saying work was busy and you needed help?
3729200	3731200	Did you still need help?
3731200	3737200	If you'd like, would you take me in my anal virginity?
3737200	3738200	It's me on the other end.
3738200	3740200	I'm like, fine, we'll hire you.
3740200	3742200	Come on down to Wonderland.
3742200	3746200	I didn't owe your mom a favor.
3746200	3748200	It's been a week since I started my new job.
3748200	3750200	What should I use my money on?
3750200	3754200	That being said, me being positive was all thanks to her.
3754200	3756200	Not really.
3756200	3758200	It was very superficial what she said because we just met.
3758200	3762200	Should I go back to that chick shop?
3762200	3763200	Oh shit, okay.
3763200	3771200	How much is that in American money?
3771200	3773200	Cool.
3773200	3779200	This is more money I have in my bank account, probably.
3779200	3780200	It's like 300 bucks?
3780200	3783200	Yep, still accurate.
3783200	3785200	Oh baby, a triple.
3785200	3789200	Oh baby, a triple.
3789200	3790200	Thank you, Saber.
3790200	3791200	Use my money on Sheeby.
3791200	3793200	Aw, thank you.
3793200	3795200	Your tips are appreciated.
3795200	3797200	Tips for Dora?
3797200	3800200	Sheeby?
3800200	3810200	Somebody made a really hilarious edit of all of our debuts in 2.0 and I could not stop laughing.
3810200	3813200	It's like 40 minutes long.
3813200	3815200	I can't...
3815200	3819200	I think it's like Vealer debuts except it's just memes.
3819200	3821200	Please give it a watch.
3821200	3822200	You watched it?
3822200	3824200	It's so hilarious.
3824200	3828200	I was crying laughing because he opens up my portion with...
3828200	3830200	Hey slaves!
3830200	3835200	I was dying laughing at Shrani's part.
3835200	3838200	Aw, it's so fucking funny.
3838200	3840200	Yeah, please watch it.
3840200	3842200	Give that person some clicks.
3842200	3845200	They deserve it for all the memes they threw in.
3845200	3847200	It's so hilarious.
3847200	3850200	Azur's was really funny too.
3850200	3852200	So I can enter the shop.
3852200	3854200	Save.
3854200	3856200	Let's do it.
3856200	3858200	Aw, look.
3858200	3860200	I can't get out.
3860200	3862200	No.
3862200	3870200	Why can't I just click on stuff and I have to press my back button?
3870200	3871200	I can't go anywhere.
3871200	3873200	I can...
3873200	3874200	Can I go to McKellen?
3874200	3878200	Okay, I have to go to the shop.
3878200	3880200	I can sleep.
3880200	3881200	I can...
3881200	3884200	Aw, I am taking so many panty shots.
3884200	3885200	Job hunting.
3885200	3886200	Wait.
3886200	3887200	I thought I had a job.
3887200	3890200	Why would I need to get another job?
3890200	3894200	Gifted vacation?
3894200	3900200	So this is just be a fucking sugar daddy simulator.
3900200	3904200	I can gamble?
3904200	3906200	I'm rubbing my hands together.
3906200	3907200	Blackjack and hookers.
3907200	3908200	Blackjack and hookers.
3908200	3911200	Blackjack and hookers.
3911200	3913200	Phim Domson.
3913200	3915200	Am I just a...
3915200	3917200	Am I just a piggy?
3917200	3920200	Am I just a little piggy?
3920200	3923200	Guys, by the way, I just want to let you know I don't do...
3923200	3930200	I don't do that side of BDSM because it's very manipulative.
3930200	3937200	A lot of the women who do that side of BDSM only do it because they know they get money.
3937200	3941200	They don't care about the people that they work with.
3941200	3943200	They don't approve of it.
3943200	3945200	I don't like it.
3945200	3949200	I've been asked before if I will do financial domination.
3949200	3953200	No.
3953200	3957200	I am just me and you donate if you want to.
3957200	3959200	And it is appreciated.
3959200	3973200	I told my parents, by the way, I have a surprise for them because I'm going to give them the $200 that you guys donated in the stream where I mentioned that my dad was very sick.
3973200	3977200	And so my parents were like, ooh, what's happening?
3977200	3979200	And I'm just going to give it to them.
3979200	3986200	I'll tell you guys what their reaction will be because I know they'll really appreciate it.
3986200	3989200	And they seemed like super like, what are you?
3989200	3991200	I'm like courtesy of my awesome streaming fans.
3991200	3995200	And my parents are like, my dad was like, oh, emoji.
3995200	3998200	And my mom was just like, oh, they're so sweet.
3998200	4001200	So yeah, my parents do know that I live stream.
4001200	4002200	They're very supportive.
4002200	4008200	They know that I also do NSFW audios.
4008200	4013200	I'm very honest with my parents.
4013200	4019200	My dad, when I told them I got into Vealer, my mom was like, oh my gosh.
4019200	4020200	Yay.
4020200	4021200	And my dad was like, yay.
4021200	4026200	And I'm like explaining to them the sort of content I'll be making like ASMR, my parents don't know what ASMR is.
4026200	4032200	And then my dad's like, OK, I have to ask, are you doing any sex work?
4032200	4039200	And I literally was like, ehh, lude audios.
4039200	4048400	He's like, I don't want to know, I don't want to know, but I will be taking my cut because
4048400	4055600	I taught you how to do voices and I'm like, fuck you dad.
4055600	4060880	He's like, I'm just gonna take credit for your well, your great reading skills and your
4060880	4067800	ability to do voices and I would like my cut and I'm like, alright dad.
4067800	4072560	He's like, just you know, 20% and I'm like, my mom's like, my mom's like, redacted, stop
4072560	4075800	it, stop teasing her.
4075800	4077800	Then my mom's like, but I want to be on your channel.
4077800	4080800	I'm like, okay.
4080800	4084080	My parents are fucking leeches guys, just kidding, no they're very supportive.
4084080	4087360	I love them to death, they're very proud of me because they know I've wanted to be a content
4087360	4091720	creator for a very long time.
4091720	4095360	I think it was this shop here, I'm a bit nervous though, why is this, they have like
4095360	4106040	a menu outside, like it's a restaurant, me more tea, parents are sick, oh, anonymous
4106040	4114800	tipped $1, thank you anonymous queen, our entire singular dollar from your pay piggy.
4114800	4116600	Good job piggy.
4116600	4122400	Now we're going to do a retweet game where I'm going to have everybody retweet and every
4122400	4128240	five retweets is $5 and whatever the else the fuck that they say when they do those
4128240	4135520	weird ass things and then I want to get a manicure and then you're a piggy.
4135520	4140160	I'm going to rinse the pig, give me your wallet.
4140160	4152120	VodCon, she's unnatural, no it's because, so when I first, when I finally was able to
4152120	4159800	log into my NSFW, I mean my alternative account on Twitter, I was like trying to go through
4159800	4166560	and there's just like a lot of like fucking like sex bots and I'm like okay and like the
4166560	4174440	majority of them were goddesses and queens and mistresses and they were all just doing
4174440	4178440	like, like had that verbiage and I'm like what the fuck is, like I'm like why is this
4178440	4179440	on my timeline?
4179440	4186360	And I started just like following like anti-artists and retubers and then I finally went away.
4186360	4190960	I'm like fuck this timeline, I don't want these bitches on my timeline.
4190960	4198480	It's free money, yeah but I don't feel good about it.
4198480	4202480	Like a tip is different because you're tipping me because you're enjoying my content.
4202480	4211400	What they're doing is they're, they're, like they're not doing it because they want to
4211400	4217360	assist in, trying to say this so that it's okay for you two but at this point I kind
4217360	4219360	of don't give a fuck.
4219360	4230000	They don't really care about like helping out their little piggy, you know, they just
4230000	4237160	want the money, they don't care about like the actual like relationship of it and it's
4237160	4244480	like the respect of it because there's, yeah I don't know, never mind.
4244480	4249120	Yeah, they're not really entertainers, it's like like and the girls just like had their
4249120	4256920	fucking feet out and they're like send me a tribute of $20 to DM me and I'm like what
4256920	4258480	the fuck is this?
4259440	4266400	It just, ah I'm sorry, just like it genuinely like irritates me but yeah but then just donate,
4266400	4273720	who donate, enjoy that but I also think I'm like it's kind of, it's kind of predatory.
4273720	4280080	Unless you have a lot of expendable income, you know, but I don't judge the people who
4280080	4284720	get pleasure from it, I don't, that's fine, you do you.
4284720	4291880	I'm not a huge fan of the people that take advantage of those people, that's it.
4291880	4296120	And those bots are annoying and most of them are fake anyways so most people are just DMing
4296120	4309400	some random cash app of like a dude in Texas who stole his wife's feed picks and is rinsing
4309400	4310400	out piggies.
4310400	4315960	But hey, at least I'm in his family could get to Disney.
4315960	4323360	Problem is that some of those men are just having their low impulse control ticket,
4323360	4330640	that's what I mean, that's another point, like there's that as well, 100%.
4330640	4335400	I would like to YouTube money but I gotta admit, yeah.
4335400	4346960	I want someone like, first and foremost, take care of yourself, that's all I say.

4804160	4805160	Hello.
4805160	4806160	Hi.
4806160	4807160	I'm far away.
4807160	4808160	Um, like I added.
4808160	4810160	You guys are gonna make fun of me and that's okay.
4810160	4811160	I don't mind it.
4811160	4812160	Cause I'm a grown bitch.
4812160	4813160	All right.
4813160	4814160	If you're going to call me a bitch,
4814160	4816160	you better put sense in it in front of it.
4816160	4819160	Um, but I put on my throne a bed frame.
4819160	4820160	Because I'm a grown bitch.
4820160	4821160	I'm a grown bitch.
4821160	4822160	I'm a grown bitch.
4822160	4823160	I'm a grown bitch.
4823160	4824160	I'm a grown bitch.
4824160	4828160	Um, but I put on my throne a bed frame because I don't have one.
4828160	4831160	I've been sleeping on a mattress on the floor for almost two years now.
4831160	4837160	Like, you know, that one picture of that guy, like, like he's like, uh, right.
4837160	4841160	My apartment is like a TV in like a lawn chair.
4841160	4844160	My apartment was that for the longest time.
4844160	4846160	And you guys are just so nice.
4846160	4848160	Somebody bought me a bed frame and I'm like,
4848160	4849160	Oh my God.
4850160	4851160	Oh my God.
4852160	4854160	I don't have to sleep on the floor.
4858160	4860160	Uh, people are too kind.
4861160	4866160	That's like, I, I hope that like when I become big enough,
4866160	4869160	I can spread that sort of love, you know,
4869160	4872160	like, uh, do like, uh, charity streams.
4874160	4876160	I think that would be really cool.
4879160	4881160	That would be really neat.
4881160	4883160	The water, ah!
4883160	4885160	It's burning myself in the water.
4886160	4890160	But yeah, like, I would love to also just like help out smaller creators
4892160	4896160	by like, collabing with smaller creators or like, um,
4898160	4899160	maybe like,
4900160	4905160	picking someone in a community who like wants to be a Vtuber, like helping them fund their model.
4906160	4910160	I feel like that would probably go bad, but you know, I'm just too nice for my own fucking good.
4915160	4916160	We need help. Okay.
4917160	4921160	I know someone who's went to UK and still does on the streamer.
4921160	4925160	I remember it when I, um, one of my friends,
4925160	4929160	she like, uh, one of my, like, um, Jesus fuck.
4929160	4931160	Anonymous tipped $50.
4931160	4933160	Here's to a future bed frame.
4933160	4935160	Also, give some to your dad.
4935160	4938160	No, I have a bed frame, but thank you.
4938160	4939160	I will.
4939160	4942160	I'll let him buy some of my comic books or something.
4945160	4947160	He'll treat himself.
4947160	4950160	It's like, I don't know, like, Starbucks coffee or something.
4952160	4957160	When I first started streaming, one of the people I became a mutuals with,
4957160	4959160	she just, she started streaming later than me,
4959160	4964160	and then someone donated her 7k dot, like 7k.
4964160	4968160	I remember the context as to why they were just like,
4968160	4971160	and just like whipped it at her during stream.
4971160	4973160	And I'm sitting there watching the stream.
4973160	4975160	I'm like, what the fuck?
4975160	4977160	Like people just like, people are, yeah.
4977160	4979160	I was like, holy crap.
4979160	4984160	People just like, I just, I just want to know, I'm like, what did they do as a job?
4984160	4986160	Like, you know those guys that like do this tiktoks?
4986160	4989160	They're like, hey, what do you do for a living?
4989160	4992160	I just want to ask those people what they do for a living.
4993160	4996160	Just buy one big bed frame and combine them.
5000160	5001160	Crazy.
5001160	5007160	I imagine like a, like a Saudi prince just like really being obsessed with VTubers.
5007160	5010160	That's actually kind of awesome.
5010160	5015160	But, um, like, but it's, but it's you guys.
5015160	5018160	Like, I need to make this point to you.
5018160	5023160	It's you guys that keep the VTubing community afloat.
5024160	5030160	Don't ever forget that without our fan base, there would be no us.
5030160	5034160	There would be no VTuber and VTubing.
5034160	5037160	So that's why your support means a lot.
5037160	5041160	However, you know, there's a fine line just because you do donate.
5041160	5049160	It does not mean you're entitled to all the VTubers attention, et cetera.
5051160	5060160	Just, yeah, I don't think I really need to elaborate on that because you are all adults, mostly some of you, I presume, here.
5062160	5065160	I'm going to get rich so I can do the ties, right?
5065160	5076160	Like, I like, so like, I always said to myself, I'm like, okay, if I ever blow up and become like a VTuber, fuck you, money, I'm just throwing it at other streamers.
5076160	5078160	I'm just fucking you.
5078160	5079160	Left, right.
5079160	5080160	You get cash.
5080160	5081160	You get cash.
5081160	5082160	You get cash.
5082160	5083160	Because I'm not someone who like needs a lot.
5083160	5084160	Like, I'm cool.
5084160	5086160	All I want is a house and I'm good.
5086160	5088160	I want a house and debt-free.
5089160	5094160	I'm just living with my cats and my chickens and my goats and my quail.
5094160	5096160	I decided I want quail, by the way.
5096160	5099160	And I want to run a rescue and that's it.
5099160	5101160	That's it.
5101160	5102160	That's it.
5102160	5105160	I don't care for fucking fancy cars.
5105160	5109160	I don't wear a designer because that's fucking stupid.
5112160	5116160	So I'm like, yeah, we're chilling.
5117160	5118160	We're chilling.
5118160	5120160	And my BDSM room.
5120160	5121160	Yep.
5121160	5128160	Imagine I get a house and I just have like a red room from like 50 Shades and I just
5128160	5131160	film everything in there.
5131160	5136160	I have like the cat cam and it's just like, there's a little like bed and on a like,
5136160	5137160	like human furniture.
5137160	5142160	Like I have somebody just like sitting there, just like holding my cats up.
5142160	5144160	No peacocks.
5145160	5148160	I don't know what I would do with peacocks when I sell the feathers.
5154160	5159160	And I also want to pay off my mom's debt and my dad's debt and buy my parents a house.
5161160	5167160	I mean, it's like an overlay but I'll, I guess, considering you're a Don Lorwitz.
5167160	5168160	Don't go to the basement.
5168160	5170160	That's where Mercy is though.
5170160	5175160	She lives in my, the apartment below me.
5175160	5177160	The like, the, what is it?
5177160	5179160	Like the in-law suite or whatever it's called.
5179160	5180160	I don't remember what it's called.
5180160	5183160	I don't know if they call it the same thing in other places outside of America.
5183160	5189160	But like normally there's like a whole other like livable space below like the main house
5189160	5193160	that usually people like have their family live in.
5193160	5194160	So Mercy's down there.
5194160	5197160	She's in the basement with her, you know, senpai.
5197160	5198160	She likes to tie up.
5198160	5199160	She doesn't question it or anything.
5201160	5202160	And keeps all, yeah, exactly.
5202160	5203160	She keeps all you guys there.
5203160	5204160	Feelers just want to go.
5204160	5205160	I made a joke.
5205160	5208160	I'm like, viewer content house when?
5210160	5212160	And we were all like, ah.
5215160	5218160	It's just Zoe burger but like V2 burgers.
5224160	5225160	You could sell farm.
5225160	5226160	That's what I want to do.
5226160	5227160	I want to sell chicken eggs.
5227160	5229160	And I want to sell quail eggs.
5229160	5231160	And Strani is like this.
5231160	5234160	I'm telling you, me and her are the same person.
5234160	5239160	I'm just brown and she's Scottish because she said she wants to do the same exact thing.
5242160	5247160	And she just wants to have a little nice sanctuary in this like live in the countryside or some shit
5247160	5248160	and take care of her animals.
5248160	5249160	And I love her for that.
5250160	5251160	Has any content house gone well?
5251160	5252160	No.
5253160	5255160	We're changing that.
5256160	5258160	We all have to move to one country for our content.
5258160	5259160	I don't know.
5259160	5260160	What would be the best place for us to move?
5267160	5268160	What kind of brown on you?
5268160	5269160	The biracial kind?
5269160	5270160	I don't know.
5270160	5274160	What flavor of black are you?
5277160	5278160	Texas.
5278160	5279160	I'm not fucking going to Texas.
5284160	5285160	No, I have had people.
5285160	5288160	So like, again, I work in retail.
5288160	5291160	People always because I'm very ethnically ambiguous looking.
5291160	5298160	I got mistaken for so many different things because I just, I don't know.
5298160	5300160	I'm like fucking mystique from X-Men.
5300160	5303160	I just look like everybody except Asian.
5303160	5305160	Actually, no, that's a lie.
5305160	5306160	One time somebody thought I was Malaysian.
5306160	5312160	They thought I was mixed because how I like did my makeup and like it was when I was really into K-pop idols.
5312160	5319160	So I did my makeup like them and it gave me a little bit of like a little Malaysian look and I was like, I look hot as fuck.
5320160	5321160	But I'm not Asian.
5323160	5324160	I'm blue.
5324160	5325160	Yes, I'm blue.
5326160	5327160	What's my hex code?
5331160	5333160	Hey, but what kind of would you ever want to come up here?
5333160	5339160	I've actually been, yeah, this is, I guess this is Zatsu so much for playing a game.
5339160	5340160	I hate myself.
5343160	5346160	I've been to Quebec and I've been to Montreal.
5346160	5348160	Oh, I do like those places.
5355160	5356160	I love Zatsu.
5356160	5358160	Every stream is a Zatsu in disguise.
5358160	5360160	This is like aim stream?
5362160	5368160	It's because I get distracted and I go off on tangents and then I want to elaborate on those tangents.
5368160	5371160	And then you guys ask me another question and then I get more.
5371160	5372160	It's your fault.
5372160	5373160	It's all I'm going to say.
5376160	5378160	Oh, her name is, how the fuck do I know her name now?
5379160	5380160	Ah, hold on.
5380160	5382160	I need to sip a tea before I start this.
5382160	5385160	I don't even, I'm not even diagnosed ADHD.
5385160	5387160	I'm just, I'm just fucking weird.
5389160	5390160	Chat reflects the streamer.
5390160	5391160	Good point.
5392160	5397160	Nine more hours and we hit the daily and strength interns quota.
5399160	5400160	I don't even get questioned.
5400160	5403160	People thought I was Chinese, Japanese, Korean, but I'm Filipino.
5403160	5404160	Just monolingual and stuff.
5404160	5405160	Yeah, I understand.
5405160	5406160	Um, oh yeah.
5406160	5408160	But my, my story, I'm just going to do it.
5408160	5412160	Then I'll do, um, I'll say my story, then I'll continue with the game.
5412160	5414160	I fucking promise.
5415160	5417160	I'm adding to my goal list.
5417160	5422160	Like actually do nothing but a game for the, for two hours.
5423160	5425160	Well, that'll kind of, well, good thing we're playing power,
5425160	5426160	power watch simulator tomorrow.
5426160	5428160	Cause then I can, yeah, and game.
5429160	5431160	I'll probably just end up standing around and the girls are doing all the work
5431160	5433160	and I'm just like, no, no, no, no, no.
5434160	5435160	Shabby, shut up.
5435160	5436160	Okay.
5438160	5444160	Um, so this person came in and they were speaking to me and they were
5444160	5446160	speaking to me and Spanish.
5447160	5449160	And I'm like, Lo siento, no hablas español.
5450160	5452160	Um, I only speak English.
5453160	5455160	And they were just like, what?
5455160	5458160	And I'm like, yeah, they're like, but you look Spanish.
5458160	5459160	And I'm like, I'm not.
5459160	5463160	They're just like, yeah, but you're Spanish.
5463160	5465160	And I'm like, but I'm not.
5465160	5467160	And they're like, you're Spanish.
5467160	5469160	I'm like, I'm, I'm black.
5469160	5470160	And they're like, no, you're not.
5470160	5472160	And I'm like, what the fuck?
5473160	5475160	They're like, you don't look black.
5475160	5480160	And I'm like, my mom is white.
5480160	5482160	I don't know what you want me to tell you.
5486160	5487160	I'm Mr. Worldwide.
5487160	5488160	I'm Shibi Worldwide.
5488160	5491160	And the person's just like, well, you look Spanish.
5491160	5493160	You should learn Spanish.
5494160	5496160	And they're like, okay, what type of black are you?
5497160	5499160	I'm like, I'm Haitian.
5499160	5501160	I'm half, I'm half Haitian.
5502160	5505160	And then I'm like a bunch of other white things.
5505160	5510160	Literally, I have like a 15 thing list on my mom's side of what I am.
5513160	5517160	And they're just like, oh, but like, Haiti's like right next to the Dominican.
5517160	5519160	So you're pretty much Spanish.
5519160	5521160	And I'm like, oh my fucking god.
5524160	5525160	You're like, you came from there?
5525160	5528160	I'm like, no, I was, I was born in America.
5533160	5534160	Please.
5538160	5542160	And I'm just sitting there and then they would like speak in like Spanglish to me.
5542160	5549160	And it's also hard because I, because I worked at my job for so long and we have a very large Spanish speaking population.
5549160	5554160	I do know quite a bit of Spanish and I could kind of usually follow along to what people are saying.
5554160	5558160	So she would slip into Spanish and I would just respond in English.
5558160	5563160	And so she's like, she looked at me and said, you're fucking lying to me in Spanish.
5563160	5565160	And I'm like, no, I'm not lying to you.
5565160	5567160	She's like, how do you know what I'm saying?
5567160	5570160	And I'm like, I'm, I just know a little bit of Spanish.
5570160	5571160	Like, what are you?
5572160	5577160	The racial mental gymnastics.
5582160	5591160	But it's funny because then like, but it's, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm not going to tell you my last name,
5591160	5597160	but I will say my last name is Arabic, but I'm not Arabic.
5598160	5601160	I'm not, I don't even know where that comes from.
5601160	5611160	And so people, customers who hear my last name that are like Middle Eastern or from Africa or from what they're just like,
5611160	5613160	Oh, speaks to me in Arabic.
5613160	5621160	And I'm just like, and then I have people who are from Egypt because apparently I look at gypsy and they're like speaks to me in the main language of Egypt.
5622160	5629160	And I'm like, no, I have people who think I'm like Cape Verdean and they're just like speaks to me in Cape Verdean.
5629160	5632160	And then I also know a little bit of Chinese.
5632160	5636160	So people will be like, Oh, are you half Chinese?
5636160	5637160	I'm like, no.
5637160	5639160	All I said was Ni Hao Ma.
5642160	5643160	What was she?
5643160	5644160	She's here.
5644160	5646160	That's all I know.
5651160	5652160	Yeah.
5654160	5655160	My last name.
5655160	5657160	Yeah, cotton bum is an Arabic last name.
5657160	5659160	I don't know though.
5665160	5671160	But yeah, I'm very, it's very fun because I usually, because customers will be like, okay, what are you?
5671160	5672160	I'm like, guess.
5672160	5675160	And so I get like the widest fucking range of guesses.
5676160	5682160	You know that like one guy who, um, what's his name?
5682160	5684160	Thanks to Cody Co.
5684160	5685160	Noel Miller.
5685160	5686160	Is that his name?
5686160	5687160	Yeah.
5687160	5689160	Who did like, they were like big on vine and all that shit.
5689160	5691160	You know how everybody like tries to guess his race?
5691160	5694160	That is how my customers are with me.
5695160	5696160	Just learn Spanish.
5696160	5698160	Full of Duolingo.
5698160	5700160	Because I don't even know what Noel Miller is.
5700160	5702160	I'm like, is he Asian?
5702160	5704160	Is he Spanish?
5706160	5707160	Is he something else?
5707160	5708160	Is he just white?
5711160	5712160	In the end, I'm just a guy.
5714160	5716160	I'm sorry if that breaks your immersion.
5718160	5719160	Apologize.
5719160	5724160	I know some people don't like to hear about this sort of stuff, but I'm an honest person and I like to talk and I like to yeah.
5724160	5729160	So, and then you would have fucking found out anyways when you see my tan ass hand.
5730160	5733160	On a hand cam stream.
5733160	5736160	Or my legs on a thigh cam stream.
5736160	5739160	You'd be like, Leonardo DiCaprio point.
5739160	5741160	What the fuck is that?
5744160	5746160	My immersion.
5748160	5750160	I do have bunny ears though.
5751160	5753160	I genuinely have bunny ears.
5754160	5756160	Don't, don't forget that like I actually have bunny ears.
5756160	5758160	I was born with a deformity.
5758160	5759160	I don't like to talk about it.
5759160	5761160	I do have bunny ears.
5761160	5762160	I don't have human ears.
5762160	5763160	I just have bunny ears.
5763160	5764160	Yep.
5769160	5770160	It's fine.
5770160	5771160	YouTube just tends to add a lighter filter.
5771160	5773160	That's actually true though.
5774160	5780160	When I was streaming on Twitch and I did my first hand cam doing like kind of the cooking popping the popping cooking that like Emmy did.
5781160	5788160	My hands look so fucking white on Twitch for my webcam.
5788160	5793160	The people were like, why the fuck are you talking about being proud?
5793160	5796160	And I'm like, no, the saturation was down.
5796160	5798160	The lighting was bad.
5798160	5805160	I'm telling you, I haven't been outside in many moons.
5806160	5808160	I changed colors.
5808160	5810160	I'm a fucking chameleon.
5813160	5814160	Sure.
5815160	5819160	My white mother laughs at me in the daily because she's darker than me right now.
5821160	5826160	Yes, I am working on getting a tan toggle for my avatar for my avatar for me.
5826160	5827160	What the fuck am I saying?
5827160	5830160	This isn't avatar the last airbender or the blue people.
5832160	5833160	My vitamin D deficient.
5833160	5834160	Yes.
5835160	5836160	Yes, I am.
5837160	5838160	Give me some of that D.
5842160	5843160	Sunny D.
5843160	5845160	Unleash the power of the sun.
5845160	5846160	Am I right?
5848160	5849160	Well, no, it'll be a toggle.
5849160	5850160	I'm going to be pulling an iron mouse.
5850160	5851160	I've already said that.
5853160	5854160	Pulling an iron mouse.
5854160	5858160	I'm going to be she be cotton bum and she be copper bum.
5861160	5863160	Instead of copper cat.
5865160	5866160	Copper.
5872160	5873160	Copper bum.
5877160	5878160	Ah, yes.
5880160	5881160	Is it me streaming today?
5882160	5884160	I haven't looked at the fucking schedule.
5887160	5888160	Log in.
5890160	5891160	No, she's not streaming today.
5891160	5892160	Okay.
5893160	5896160	I'll stream a little bit past my time so we can actually get to game.
5898160	5899160	Is there in two hours?
5899160	5901160	Okay, I'll probably, I'll stream into a zero then.
5903160	5905160	Any relation to Rodney copper?
5905160	5906160	No.
5908160	5911160	I am canonically related to every bunny character.
5911160	5918160	However, distant related to Mr. Hopps and Lola Bunny, Jessica Rabbit,
5918160	5921160	and all other bunny VTubers also fall under that sphere.
5923160	5925160	The AutoCast fashion one.
5925160	5926160	At some point.
5929160	5932160	If only there was a combined schedule for other girls that we can see.
5932160	5934160	Well, we have our own little thing for that.
5934160	5935160	I just looked at it.
5936160	5937160	You guys can make your own.
5940160	5945160	I think Manesan is working on updating the website,
5945160	5947160	so it does show all of our schedules.
5947160	5949160	That would actually be really cool.
5950160	5952160	Bonnie from FNA- yes.
5952160	5954160	BigChunkus is a cousin of mine.
5955160	5957160	Jessica Rabbit was just her married name.
5957160	5960160	Yeah, because I'm related to Roger Rabbit.
5962160	5965160	And Jessica is related to me by marriage.
5965160	5966160	Yep.
5968160	5970160	LowPunny is my first cousin once.
5970160	5971160	No.
5971160	5972160	No.
5973160	5974160	This is not Alabama.
5975160	5977160	Bugs Bunny.
5977160	5979160	Yeah, they're related to me.
5979160	5981160	Related to JoJo Rabbit.
5981160	5983160	I actually watched them the other day.
5983160	5984160	It was pretty actually fucking funny.
5984160	5985160	I love Taiko.
5985160	5987160	I didn't finish it though.
5987160	5988160	I think I fell asleep.
5991160	5993160	You can see the resemblance.
5993160	5994160	Yeah.
5994160	5998160	Although, how do we have resemblance if she's related to me by marriage, guys?
5999160	6001160	Related to Peter Rabbit.
6002160	6003160	He's a...
6005160	6007160	Any anthropomorphic bunnies,
6007160	6009160	like LowPunny because she's like a Pokemon,
6009160	6012160	but she doesn't have sentience like a human like Bugs does.
6012160	6014160	They are not really...
6014160	6017160	They are extremely distant.
6017160	6019160	Extremely distant, you know?
6023160	6026160	Okay, is it funny or is it boring that you fell asleep midway?
6026160	6027160	No, I just fell...
6027160	6029160	I was just up really late.
6029160	6030160	And I just...
6030160	6033160	Sometimes, you know how you put something on to fall asleep too?
6033160	6034160	Or just to listen to?
6034160	6036160	I was really into the first half.
6036160	6037160	I literally...
6037160	6039160	I think 30 minutes or 40 minutes to finish.
6043160	6046160	Yes, I do have acme powers.
6046160	6052160	And my acme powers, it means I can inflate, flatten out,
6052160	6054160	do a lot of different things.
6054160	6058160	Just like, you know, how Bugs Bunny does in cartoons
6058160	6060160	and Roger Rabbit, I am...
6060160	6062160	I do have toon powers.
6062160	6064160	I do have toon powers, yep.
6066160	6068160	So basically, exactly.
6068160	6069160	Just like Luffy.
6069160	6071160	Toon for you, exactly.
6072160	6073160	No.
6073160	6074160	No inflation.
6075160	6076160	None of that.
6076160	6080160	None of that inflation cake, please.
6085160	6086160	Chibi Chungus.
6086160	6088160	Does paint thinner kill you?
6088160	6090160	It hurts a little.
6090160	6091160	Like it burns a little.
6091160	6094160	It's like when you stick your hand on a hot stove,
6094160	6097160	but it won't kill me.
6100160	6101160	You're not Google Sonic.
6101160	6104160	I wasn't planning on Googling Sonic inflation.
6106160	6107160	It's too late, you're canonizing.
6107160	6108160	I am...
6108160	6110160	I can retcon it too.
6110160	6114160	I can retcon it too, bitch.
6116160	6118160	Won't kill you, but this is mean you'll enjoy it.
6118160	6119160	Exactly.
6120160	6122160	Inflation in this economy.
6125160	6127160	Cartoon versus anime jeans.
6127160	6129160	Exactly, because like I have my anime jeans
6129160	6132160	and I have my cartoon jeans, you know?
6132160	6134160	Who are my parents?
6134160	6135160	I don't know.
6135160	6137160	To be honest with you, I don't know who my parents are.
6137160	6139160	My RTX parents, they're pretty cool,
6139160	6143160	but my 2D parents, I don't really know too much about them.
6143160	6147160	One might be, you know, one might be just like,
6147160	6149160	I don't like, there is a family rumor.
6149160	6152160	I kind of try to ignore it that Jessica Rabbit is my mom
6152160	6156160	and that she cheated on Roger with bugs
6156160	6160160	or it's like Lola cheated on bugs with Roger.
6160160	6162160	I don't know the truth of that.
6162160	6164160	So I try not to worry about it too much
6164160	6166160	because you know, I'm not trying to,
6166160	6169160	I don't need, I already have like a familial relationship with them.
6169160	6170160	I don't want to fuck it up, you know?
6170160	6172160	I don't want to make it weird by being like,
6172160	6174160	oh, like taking paternity tests and all that shit, you know?
6177160	6179160	What the fuck am I on right now?
6181160	6184160	You know, it's just like, you know, weird family stuff.
6186160	6188160	Weird family stuff.
6188160	6190160	Yeah, or Lola cheated on bugs with Jessica.
6190160	6191160	I don't know.
6191160	6192160	I don't know how that works.
6193160	6196160	There was a rumor that, you know,
6196160	6198160	on Jessica was packing.
6198160	6199160	I don't know.
6201160	6202160	Okay, we're crazy.
6202160	6204160	The chat for 14 of my immortal.
6206160	6207160	Random Lord.
6207160	6209160	Oh yeah, what the fuck was I doing?
6210160	6211160	Oh yeah, playing a game.
6211160	6214160	I literally just talked for two hours.
6215160	6216160	What the fuck?
6222160	6225160	I didn't even play the fucking game.
6225160	6226160	All right.
6229160	6230160	I need a sip of tea.
6232160	6234160	Jessica Rabbit canonically rugged.
6234160	6235160	What?
6237160	6239160	Yeah, retract that message.
6239160	6240160	What the fuck is that?
6243160	6246160	I should play there is no game like that one.
6246160	6248160	And then just like, just talk the other time
6248160	6250160	because there's no game because I'm just talking.
6253160	6258160	Uh, the customer who looked tired.
6258160	6259160	You came.
6259160	6260160	Yeah, I did.
6261160	6262160	That's right.
6262160	6263160	The customer who came.
6263160	6264160	I mean, who looked tired.
6264160	6265160	I'm here.
6267160	6268160	It makes me happy.
6269160	6271160	Oh, are you feeling nervous?
6271160	6272160	Is this...
6272160	6275160	Why are the dudes in the back fucking unlockable characters?
6276160	6279160	Is this your first time at a place like this?
6279160	6281160	Is that guy over there?
6281160	6282160	Okay.
6282160	6283160	Like he doesn't have a face.
6283160	6284160	Don't worry about it.
6284160	6285160	Uh, okay.
6285160	6286160	Well, that's right.
6286160	6287160	I've never been here.
6288160	6289160	I see.
6289160	6291160	Well, then I guess I'll give you a brief explanation
6291160	6293160	on how it works because you haven't started
6293160	6294160	the fucking game yet.
6294160	6295160	It's been two hours.
6298160	6299160	I love the dude profile.
6299160	6301160	It's to give the main character.
6303160	6304160	Please.
6304160	6305160	I don't know anything.
6305160	6306160	So this will help.
6307160	6309160	The name of the shop is Bunny Garden,
6309160	6311160	a fun place to drink.
6311160	6312160	We're run.
6312160	6315160	We're owned by Wonderland Enterprises.
6315160	6317160	The CEO is Shibi...
6317160	6318160	Shut the fuck up.
6318160	6319160	You can't say her name.
6319160	6320160	I'm sure you can't say...
6320160	6321160	Okay, sorry.
6321160	6323160	Never mind one of the girls said I can't talk about it.
6323160	6324160	That's all.
6325160	6328160	Oh, uh, seems like I should understand,
6328160	6329160	but I don't.
6330160	6332160	Well, you'll gradually get used to it.
6332160	6333160	So it's okay.
6333160	6335160	I'll be really happy if you come here lots of times.
6335160	6337160	You'll come here...
6337160	6339160	Lots of times, won't you?
6340160	6341160	You'll come...
6343160	6344160	Here...
6345160	6347160	In my Bunny Garden...
6348160	6350160	Lots of times, right?
6356160	6357160	Anyways...
6358160	6359160	I agree.
6359160	6361160	To do that, I have to work hard at my current job
6361160	6363160	because I have to take responsibility.
6364160	6365160	Well then,
6365160	6367160	I want you to be able to do your best
6367160	6369160	so I hope I can give you a lot of healing.
6369160	6371160	Drop your pants!
6385160	6387160	This is really good tea.
6387160	6390160	I'm sorry, I choked a little bit a moment ago.
6390160	6391160	So sorry.
6394160	6395160	Okay.
6397160	6398160	What's commence?
6401160	6403160	If I feel if I work harder,
6404160	6405160	my dick gets hard.
6405160	6406160	I'll feel better.
6406160	6407160	Why did you say it?
6407160	6408160	Don't worry about it.
6408160	6409160	It's decided!
6410160	6411160	Oh, I'm sorry.
6411160	6412160	I didn't hear your order.
6413160	6414160	Here you are.
6414160	6415160	This is the menu.
6415160	6416160	Right.
6416160	6418160	Maybe you'll have a drink.
6419160	6420160	You guys got...
6420160	6422160	Wait, what's...
6423160	6424160	Icy Nade,
6424160	6426160	and Sheeby Nade,
6427160	6428160	and Amy Nade,
6428160	6430160	and Azura Nade,
6431160	6432160	and Mercy Nade,
6432160	6433160	and Strani Nade.
6434160	6436160	It's in a section called Lemon Nades.
6437160	6438160	Can you elaborate?
6439160	6441160	It just says in the description
6441160	6442160	fresh from the source.
6442160	6443160	What does that mean?
6444160	6446160	Sorry, I can't elaborate on the drink menu.
6447160	6449160	You'll have to talk to my superior.
6450160	6451160	Okay.
6451160	6453160	I guess I'll just have a normal drink then.
6455160	6456160	What drink did you want?
6459160	6460160	A pricier drink could increase...
6460160	6463160	A pricier drink can increase my likability?
6463160	6464160	What the fuck?
6469160	6470160	Can I...
6470160	6471160	I'll have to use my arrows.
6471160	6472160	Where's the sound?
6473160	6475160	Oh, my headphones are turned off.
6477160	6478160	Excuse me.
6482160	6484160	I feel like I need to spend a bag.
6489160	6490160	Oh, wait, I have to use these.
6490160	6492160	Which is the most expensive drink on the menu?
6495160	6496160	Jesus fuck.
6504160	6505160	Bunny trap?
6506160	6508160	I'll take the House Lemon Sour.
6511160	6512160	Oh, so the Immy Nade.
6513160	6514160	Yeah, whatever.
6515160	6516160	I want to drink something too.
6517160	6518160	I have to buy you a drink?
6519160	6520160	Is this what...
6521160	6523160	like bars are like?
6523160	6525160	Like some bars are in Japan?
6525160	6527160	Cause like I've never been to like a maid cafe
6527160	6528160	or like any of that stuff.
6528160	6529160	Again, I'm very...
6529160	6531160	I don't have a sort of thing in America.
6531160	6532160	Cabaret bars?
6533160	6534160	It's a hostess club?
6534160	6536160	Yeah, we don't have those around.
6539160	6540160	That's really actually...
6540160	6541160	I'm like thinking, I'm like,
6541160	6543160	wait, that'd be a good job.
6543160	6545160	It's like Hooters, except they buy you drinks.
6545160	6547160	If you don't drink them to drinks,
6547160	6548160	they'll pour...
6548160	6550160	What if one of the girls gets fucking shit-faced?
6552160	6554160	Cause if you don't drink them to drinks,
6554160	6555160	they'll pour...
6555160	6557160	What if one of the girls gets fucking shit-faced?
6559160	6560160	Cause if you don't drink them to drinks,
6561160	6562160	cause if you're like hanging out
6562160	6564160	and drinking with people all the time,
6566160	6568160	like if like, you have five customers
6568160	6570160	and they just keep buying you drinks,
6571160	6574160	like are you limited to like one customer?
6574160	6575160	Like what is how does...
6575160	6576160	What's the...
6576160	6578160	I need an explanation here.
6581160	6582160	Actually, yeah,
6582160	6583160	I remember someone said they were like
6583160	6585160	trying to make a VTuber hostess bar.
6585160	6587160	That would actually be really fucking cool.
6587160	6589160	Like do you like hologram, Miku?
6589160	6591160	Except make it a VTuber 3D model.
6592160	6594160	And I will gladly sit and have a drink with you
6594160	6595160	and then I'll probably die
6595160	6597160	because I can't handle all the call that will.
6601160	6603160	I'll buy you some...
6604160	6605160	a special highball.
6609160	6610160	Actually, you're a nice lady.
6610160	6611160	I'm gonna buy you a fine wine.
6615160	6616160	Oh, this is great.
6616160	6617160	I love this.
6619160	6620160	Whoa.
6621160	6622160	Hello?
6635160	6636160	I can zoom?
6641160	6643160	I can give them presents?
6643160	6644160	Holy shit.
6645160	6648160	So being a hostess bar is literally like
6650160	6653160	being a girlfriend in a hoe without the sex.
6653160	6655160	And you just gotta be nice to people.
6657160	6659160	I would be so fucking good at that.
6660160	6663160	Cause like I have a very nice and charismatic personality.
6663160	6664160	Just saying.
6664160	6665160	Look it.
6665160	6667160	There's a couple of you guys here.
6667160	6669160	It means you like me.
6672160	6673160	GFE for a night?
6674160	6676160	Fendom but with interaction?
6677160	6678160	No, cause like...
6678160	6681160	Fendom, like usually the dimes only take, they don't give.
6691160	6693160	Thank you, Velvet Queen.
6696160	6700160	Absolute mad lad Velvet Queen with the 127?
6703160	6705160	I'm literally talking about...
6705160	6708160	I'm getting panty shots and people are giving me 100 bucks.
6708160	6709160	What's wrong with it?
6709160	6711160	There's something wrong with this picture.
6712160	6713160	Thank you, thank you so much.
6713160	6714160	I'm doing a little heart.
6714160	6715160	I'm doing a little heart.
6715160	6717160	A little sa-dang-yay for you.
6718160	6719160	They bought me a drink.
6719160	6720160	It was a very expensive drink.
6720160	6721160	Thank you.
6728160	6729160	How do I zoom?
6730160	6731160	How do I zoom?
6731160	6732160	Let me zoom it.
6733160	6735160	I'm like fucking a...
6737160	6739160	I can't even remember the meme.
6739160	6740160	I just want to zoom.
6743160	6744160	It's chat.
6744160	6745160	Did you even tell me your name?
6746160	6747160	I'm getting kind of nervous.
6748160	6752160	I mean, it's going to be the first time I meet this next customer.
6753160	6754160	You know I'm right here.
6754160	6757160	Like I can hear everything you're saying out loud.
6757160	6760160	My heart feels like it's going to explode from how fast it's racing.
6760160	6762160	Why are you ignoring me?
6763160	6765160	Oh, what am I saying?
6765160	6768160	The purpose of this place is to make customers feel relaxed.
6768160	6769160	Not stressed.
6769160	6774160	Yeah, but you're stressing me out because you're acting fucking crazy talking to yourself.
6774160	6778160	If I'm in a state like this, I'm sure the customer is going to feel the same.
6778160	6780160	Come on now, you've got this.
6781160	6783160	Bitch, what the fuck are you on?
6784160	6786160	Sorry, I'm schizophrenic.
6786160	6788160	Okay, let's start off with the reasonable.
6788160	6789160	Huh?
6789160	6791160	The first step in the order is to become friends.
6791160	6795160	You're the customer, so please go right ahead with everything you've got.
6796160	6799160	You can't see what I'm doing, so I'm taking my arm.
6799160	6800160	I'm throwing it over my shoulder.
6800160	6804160	I'm throwing it in front of myself like I have a giant cock.
6805160	6807160	That's my first step.
6810160	6812160	You like what you see?
6817160	6818160	Huh?
6819160	6821160	I mean...
6823160	6826160	She said, show me what you got, so I showed her what I got.
6828160	6830160	You're fine, don't worry about it.
6833160	6834160	I hurt my elbow.
6835160	6836160	Oh my god.
6838160	6840160	She's my words carefully.
6840160	6842160	What a better hug.
6843160	6844160	What, no hug?
6844160	6848160	There was a dude at my job that would do that, and I fucking hated him.
6849160	6850160	He'd be like, where's my hug?
6850160	6852160	I'm like, non-existent.
6852160	6854160	Sorry, a customer is calling, bye.
6855160	6858160	I'm sorry, if you do that to girls, you're fucking annoying.
6858160	6859160	Where my hug at?
6861160	6865160	And then, sometimes, because like for me...
6866160	6873160	So I have OCD and certain like feelings and like pressure and textures.
6873160	6875160	Maybe I'm just autistic.
6876160	6877160	Really bother me.
6877160	6886160	I don't like to be hugged too much unless I really like you or for like a really close family member or family friend or my parents.
6887160	6893160	Like I literally will only let like Salem and Olive and my parents hug me and my family members.
6895160	6896160	But like when like...
6896160	6903160	Because I'll say like people are like really touchy-feely and like, I don't know, like I'm just not like that.
6906160	6909160	Yeah, I'm sorry, physical touch is not my love language.
6909160	6912160	Naturally as a dom, it's acts of service.
6912160	6916160	So get on your knees and eat this cushy-coochie.
6920160	6922160	Madam Desiree Savis?
6924160	6925160	I need a bell.
6925160	6927160	I need a bell to ring.
6927160	6928160	Do I have a bell?
6928160	6929160	I know I have a fucking bell.
6931160	6932160	Well, it's not a bell actually.
6932160	6936160	It's, I think it's my candle snuffer.
6936160	6937160	Snuffing?
6937160	6938160	Let's see where it is.
6938160	6940160	But it like sounds like a bell.
6948160	6949160	Oh, it's not dinging.
6952160	6954160	Usually it makes a ding noise.
6955160	6956160	Damn it.
6957160	6959160	Matty perquias dick!
6960160	6962160	Dick actus once!
6963160	6965160	Just imagine bell noises, okay?
6965160	6966160	Thank you.
6975160	6976160	Or coochie.
6976160	6977160	We don't discriminate in this household.
6978160	6979160	Okay.
6981160	6983160	So a toast or something?
6983160	6985160	That's what I just fucking said.
6987160	6988160	That's the spirit.
6988160	6990160	You seem eager to start drinking.
6990160	6992160	But don't you think sharing each other's names comes first?
6992160	6995160	Well, by the little bar that's next to your body,
6995160	6997160	I can kind of surmise your name is Kanna,
6997160	7002160	or Kanna, or can I eat your pussy out tonight?
7002160	7003160	What?
7003160	7004160	Never mind.
7006160	7008160	Anyways, I'd love to know more about you.
7008160	7009160	Right.
7009160	7011160	My name is Haito Kanna.
7011160	7012160	Yeah, Kanda.
7014160	7017160	I will butcher Japanese names.
7017160	7019160	I apologize to my Japanese friends.
7022160	7024160	The Vaude staying up!
7024160	7026160	Relax, the Vaude staying up.
7027160	7028160	Relax.
7028160	7029160	Oh, I just remembered,
7029160	7033160	because I just see someone with Oshimarks in their name
7033160	7034160	that aren't mine.
7034160	7035160	Fuck you, first of all.
7035160	7036160	But I don't really blame you,
7036160	7042160	because my Oshimarks don't work on YouTube.
7042160	7045160	So, we're going to do a quick tangent.
7045160	7047160	When I say quick, I mean 30 minutes.
7049160	7052160	I was going to suggest that we pick
7052160	7054160	some that are YouTube-friendly.
7056160	7057160	I forgot to actually see that.
7057160	7059160	I was going to suggest that we pick
7059160	7061160	some that are YouTube-friendly.
7061160	7063160	I forgot to actually see that.
7067160	7068160	Only 30?
7068160	7069160	That's optimistic!
7071160	7073160	Slow your fucking roll, kid, okay?
7074160	7077160	Don't disrespect me in my own households.
7078160	7080160	I'm roping, but yeah.
7080160	7082160	I know, mercies don't, like,
7082160	7084160	mercies scissors don't work.
7086160	7089160	Your vote is a snail in a tongue.
7092160	7097160	Yeah, I see, yeah, polar bear doesn't work.
7099160	7101160	But, like, bear and ice cube make sense.
7101160	7102160	That works.
7103160	7104160	Oh!
7105160	7106160	Since the bunny works,
7106160	7108160	I will be bold and suggest the heal
7108160	7110160	and the other bunny.
7112160	7113160	But the bunny doesn't work.
7117160	7119160	Is it the bunny face?
7120160	7123160	Because the bunny, like, body doesn't work.
7130160	7131160	But, like, try to put the bunny,
7131160	7132160	because, like, you know,
7132160	7136160	like, you look at my old videos,
7136160	7139160	I had the rope in the bunny in my title.
7139160	7140160	I might have taken it out, actually.
7140160	7141160	They don't show up.
7141160	7142160	They just show up as squares.
7143160	7145160	So I think the bunny head would work,
7145160	7147160	and then the high-heeled shoe would work.
7150160	7152160	The bunny twins in an act!
7154160	7155160	That's just the shining.
7161160	7163160	No, it was the, it was the,
7163160	7165160	it's the bunny with the body
7165160	7166160	and the rope.
7166160	7167160	They both don't work.
7167160	7168160	Is it device to shoot?
7168160	7169160	No.
7173160	7174160	Because that's,
7174160	7176160	the second one you posted, Nugget,
7176160	7178160	isn't an emote, actually.
7178160	7181160	Like a, like a normal emote, I don't think.
7185160	7187160	Okay, here, let's, let's do this together.
7189160	7190160	Well, put some in your fucking name,
7190160	7191160	then we'll see.
7194160	7196160	What a fitting game.
7196160	7197160	All right.
7197160	7198160	Now I have to pick them.
7200160	7201160	Damn, can you even test a working chat?
7201160	7203160	Yeah, it looks like, see, they're working chat.
7204160	7206160	But if you put them in your name, doesn't work.
7207160	7210160	Oshimark can just be the membership icon.
7210160	7212160	You mean the Gimp Bunny?
7212160	7213160	I don't...
7217160	7220160	No, but the, no, I want Oshimarks!
7220160	7221160	I'm not settling!
7224160	7225160	A bunny in vomit?
7226160	7227160	You fell for that.
7227160	7228160	A bunny in a knife?
7228160	7230160	I'm not, no, I would say probably a heart
7230160	7232160	in a knife for mercy.
7233160	7234160	I'm gonna say
7235160	7236160	the gunny, if you will.
7236160	7237160	Is there, there's only a pistol.
7237160	7239160	I wish, I wish they had like this water pistol.
7239160	7240160	I wish they had the old gun back.
7242160	7244160	I use this account for normal stuff, though.
7245160	7246160	Well, that's too fucking bad.
7249160	7251160	I'm not changing my Oshimarks.
7251160	7253160	Like, this is the only specific to,
7253160	7255160	actually, you know what?
7257160	7259160	Until membership's open,
7259160	7261160	if you wanna show your support
7261160	7262160	and show that you're a harem member,
7262160	7265160	you can put just the red high-heeled shoe in your name.
7265160	7267160	So I don't think anybody uses that.
7267160	7270160	I said, yeah, the red high-heeled shoe would be cool.
7271160	7273160	Cause I think the red high-heeled shoe works.
7275160	7276160	And then like some bunny doesn't even,
7276160	7277160	that can just be anybody.
7279160	7281160	Yeah, yeah.
7285160	7288160	Yeah, bunny head, red heel.
7289160	7290160	Pig.
7292160	7294160	Yeah, whatever fucking one works.
7294160	7296160	But just the red heel, definitely.
7296160	7298160	Cause that one's obvious.
7299160	7301160	Some bunny, what's told me?
7303160	7304160	A rat?
7305160	7306160	That would be more emmy.
7307160	7308160	She got rats.
7312160	7313160	Yeah, so you can do,
7313160	7316160	you can do a heel in whatever your heart desires.
7316160	7317160	What's an Oshimark?
7318160	7319160	I like to explain it as,
7319160	7321160	imagine it's a cutie mark.
7322160	7323160	Of your favorite VTuber.
7323160	7324160	But what's a cutie mark?
7324160	7326160	It's a little symbol that shows aspects
7326160	7328160	of the pony's personality.
7329160	7330160	For example, Twilight Sparkle.
7330160	7332160	She's purplish, like Twilight.
7332160	7334160	And there's a sparkler in her name.
7334160	7337160	So it's like a purply sparkle on her punch.
7341160	7344160	I've always said that Oshimarks are just cutie marks.
7344160	7345160	Oshimarks.
7350160	7353160	Did you put a red heel in a pregnant man?
7356160	7357160	That was good.
7357160	7358160	That was fucking good.
7358160	7359160	That got me.
7362160	7364160	Mmm, some pop rocks to eat.
7369160	7370160	I'm yum.
7375160	7377160	What are you looking at me like?
7377160	7378160	What the fuck are you doing?
7381160	7382160	Good night.
7385160	7386160	No, there's this, I think there's a setting
7386160	7388160	just to like put it in your name,
7388160	7389160	like your display name.
7393160	7394160	Only if you want to.
7399160	7402160	Oh, look at you guys with your bunny heel.
7402160	7404160	Ow, it makes me happy.
7406160	7408160	Oh my God, that makes me so happy.
7410160	7412160	I'll add it to my description.
7413160	7415160	Like if you want to show your support,
7416160	7418160	here are the YouTube Oshimarks.
7418160	7420160	And I'll just put like the bunny in the heel.
7421160	7422160	Heal in a nose.
7425160	7426160	Cool.
7427160	7428160	My day is made.
7428160	7430160	Bro, I was so productive today.
7430160	7432160	I went to the doctor's office.
7432160	7433160	I paid some bills.
7433160	7435160	I still haven't done my dishes.
7438160	7440160	I picked up my mail and my packages.
7440160	7441160	I'm streaming.
7443160	7444160	I got lunch.
7447160	7448160	I'm feeling good today.
7449160	7451160	I napped for 30 minutes.
7452160	7453160	It was more like 15.
7453160	7455160	These Pop Rocks are so fucking good.
7456160	7457160	I'm adulting.
7458160	7460160	Can you play the game now, please?
7460160	7462160	Can you please play the game?
7462160	7463160	Shabee.
7464160	7465160	Shabee, you play the-
7465160	7466160	Shut the fuck up.
7469160	7471160	The big kids are talking, the big kids.
7471160	7472160	The adults are talking.
7473160	7474160	I just choked in a pop,
7474160	7475160	almost in a pop socket.
7476160	7477160	Pop Rock.
7478160	7479160	Suck my left titties.
7479160	7480160	Anyways.
7481160	7483160	You don't need to keep looking at me like that.
7484160	7485160	There's a cake.
7485160	7486160	Pop Rocks are awful.
7488160	7489160	Nobody asked.
7491160	7492160	Did anyone ask?
7492160	7493160	What is that?
7493160	7494160	Oh, nobody asked.
7494160	7495160	That's crazy.
7495160	7496160	Anyways.
7498160	7499160	I'm more of a righty guy.
7502160	7504160	You don't need to keep looking at me like that.
7505160	7506160	I'm a righty guy.
7506160	7508160	You don't need to keep looking at me like that.
7509160	7510160	Oh, sorry.
7511160	7514160	I wanted to remember your name and face, you see.
7514160	7517160	So, well, I look like the other two guys in this place.
7517160	7519160	I'm just a black void.
7522160	7524160	Yeah, I know, but you know.
7526160	7527160	There's no need to worry.
7527160	7529160	I've matched your face to your name now.
7529160	7530160	But I look-
7530160	7531160	I'm an unlockable character.
7532160	7533160	Okay, it's my turn now.
7534160	7535160	Oh, alright.
7535160	7536160	My name's Kana.
7536160	7538160	I don't mind if you give me a nickname,
7538160	7540160	but I sure you hope to-
7540160	7541160	Yeah.
7542160	7543160	Alright.
7543160	7544160	I'll call you Conti.
7545160	7546160	Because you're a cunt.
7546160	7548160	You talk to yourself a lot.
7548160	7550160	I'll do my best to match your name to your face then.
7550160	7551160	Kana-Chan.
7552160	7553160	Yeah.
7554160	7556160	Gonna come on her chin.
7556160	7557160	What was that?
7557160	7558160	Oh, sorry.
7558160	7559160	Kana-Chan.
7560160	7561160	Hey, stop it.
7561160	7563160	You're making me all flustered.
7563160	7567160	I- I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at.
7567160	7570160	Well, you got massive fucking jugs.
7570160	7571160	So...
7572160	7576160	I suppose there's some things you learned from first-hand experience.
7576160	7580160	Yup, I guess I got a little smarter from this whole situation.
7581160	7582160	What are you talking about?
7582160	7585160	Well, tell me more about yourself, Haidoku.
7586160	7589160	Ugh, I messed up real bad at work recently,
7589160	7592160	and because of that, the boss fired me.
7592160	7594160	So I've been assisting a friend at his-
7594160	7595160	I wonder what he did for his job.
7595160	7597160	Like, what did he fuck up?
7599160	7603160	If you ever do a compilation of streams, this will definitely make it.
7604160	7607160	An intrusive thoughts are waiting today.
7607160	7610160	His nickname is longer than her real name.
7611160	7615160	It's more like you're cleaning and not making more dirty dishes to clean dishes up.
7615160	7617160	Yeah, it's because I had dishes in the dishwasher,
7617160	7619160	I still need to take them out and put the other dishes away,
7619160	7621160	and then put the new ones in the dishwasher.
7624160	7625160	I stole someone's sandwich.
7625160	7627160	Probably forgot to use MLA format.
7627160	7628160	That's what I'm going with.
7629160	7630160	I need burp.
7634160	7635160	My god.
7635160	7637160	I really like the like-
7638160	7641160	like the stuff coming from the ceiling that the-
7641160	7644160	all the drinks are on, that's actually really fucking cool.
7644160	7646160	Like the- the place in here is pretty sick.
7646160	7648160	Oh, that sounds rough.
7648160	7650160	Anyways, wanna buy me another drink?
7650160	7654160	If I was in your shoes, I probably wouldn't even be able to eat.
7654160	7656160	You should just kill yourself.
7660160	7661160	What?
7661160	7664160	Uh, though, I- sorry, I meant to say, though I'm sure words
7664160	7666160	can't express how awful you must feel.
7666160	7668160	I'm so sorry.
7668160	7670160	Did you just tell me to kill me?
7670160	7671160	No!
7671160	7672160	Silly.
7672160	7674160	Alright, I- I got it.
7674160	7676160	I'm going to do my absolute best
7676160	7678160	in order for you to get back on your feet.
7679160	7680160	What the fuck?
7680160	7682160	Are you gonna do- are you gonna give me a job?
7684160	7686160	The time you spend here will be-
7686160	7687160	I'm- I'm gonna ignore that.
7687160	7689160	The time you spend here will be a constant smile.
7689160	7691160	I can assure you that much.
7692160	7694160	I hope we get a long haitoku.
7695160	7697160	Can you keep drinking haitoku?
7697160	7698160	Don't push yourself, okay?
7698160	7701160	I have like five other guys I need to hang out with.
7701160	7703160	And we're gonna get some burgers and fries later.
7708160	7710160	I can't- should I keep talking to her?
7718160	7720160	This game sucks, dude.
7727160	7728160	No, no.
7729160	7730160	No, no.
7731160	7732160	That's funny.
7733160	7734160	Okay.
7735160	7737160	Wow, is it already this late?
7737160	7738160	I'll head back home.
7740160	7741160	Jesus fuck.
7743160	7744160	Thank you for today.
7744160	7745160	See you soon.

7887160	7889160	Why are there only three girls?
7891160	7893160	Two of them look the same.
7895160	7897160	They're dressed like they're-
7898160	7901160	Bunny Power Rangers.
7901160	7902160	I just-

7932160	7933160	This one
7935160	7936160	is-
7937160	7939160	None of the girls in our group look like that.
7939160	7941160	This is Emmy because they have the same pigtails.
7942160	7943160	No, I wouldn't-
7943160	7944160	Never mind.
7944160	7945160	That's not-
7945160	7947160	None of these girls are us because
7948160	7949160	I've been making some-
7949160	7950160	If this was Emmy,
7950160	7952160	I'd be making serious savers from really stupid shit.
7953160	7954160	Although,
7954160	7956160	Telling someone to kill themselves.
7956160	7957160	Telling someone to kill themselves.
7957160	7959160	It's very on-gagged for her.
7960160	7961160	How's it going?
7961160	7962160	How was the stream?
7963160	7966160	My sweet, sweet Yume Plus girls.
7966160	7968160	My sweet girls.
7969160	7970160	So, so cute.

7987160	7988160	See? There you go.
7994160	7995160	They're such cute girls.
7996160	7998160	I'm honestly surprised they're not like
8000160	8001160	fucking ginormous.
8002160	8003160	They should be.
8003160	8004160	I love watching their streams.
8004160	8006160	They don't know, but I creep on their streams
8007160	8009160	and I like to giggle at them a lot.
8010160	8011160	I just lurk.
8015160	8016160	Help!
8018160	8019160	Yeah, yeah, I'm watching you.
8021160	8022160	I'm watching you, Mamosa.
8022160	8024160	I'm gonna drink you like a Mamosa.
8024160	8025160	Okay, anyways, let's gamble.
8026160	8027160	Gambling up to ten times.
8028160	8029160	If I was a true gambler,
8029160	8030160	I would have no limit.
8032160	8033160	I'm leaving!
8035160	8036160	Okay, I'm staying.
8038160	8039160	Yeah, pull up a chair.
8040160	8041160	Pull up a chair, baby girl.
8042160	8043160	Pull up a chair, baby girl.
8044160	8046160	Come hang out in my bunny garden.
8047160	8048160	Yeah.
8051160	8052160	Can we play Blackjack?
8056160	8057160	What the hell is this?
8059160	8061160	Is this a Skull King from Inscription?
8062160	8063160	Gambling!
8067160	8068160	Wait!
8069160	8071160	I don't even fucking play a game.
8072160	8073160	I just lose money?
8076160	8077160	Are you serious?
8078160	8080160	I'm never fucking using this again.
8080160	8081160	Why would I ever gamble?
8081160	8082160	What is the point?
8083160	8084160	Now I have less money.
8088160	8089160	But like, I wish,
8089160	8090160	I thought there'd be like a cute mini game
8090160	8091160	where I play like Blackjack
8091160	8092160	or like poker
8092160	8094160	or like fucking Solitaire.
8094160	8095160	I don't know.
8096160	8097160	What the hell, man?
8097160	8098160	I've been cheated.
8100160	8102160	You can save Skum till you win.
8102160	8103160	No, I'm not going to do that.
8104160	8106160	I was lost 20 bucks!
8108160	8109160	Let's do it again.
8113160	8114160	Can I like,
8114160	8115160	can I just like, skip ahead?
8115160	8117160	I don't care about this fucking splash screen.
8126160	8127160	No!
8133160	8134160	No!
8140160	8141160	No!
8142160	8143160	Alright, let's do it again.
8146160	8149160	I just used 31k yet!
8151160	8152160	Run it back!
8152160	8153160	Run it back!
8153160	8155160	Run me my, oh fuck, I lost again.
8158160	8159160	Okay, no.

8171160	8172160	I love this game!
8174160	8175160	No, I don't!
8176160	8178160	I feel like we're going to debt.
8178160	8183160	I remember I went to a casino with $50
8183160	8184160	and I lost it all
8184160	8185160	and I cried.
8185160	8187160	It was only $50.
8189160	8190160	It wasn't even my $50.
8190160	8192160	It was my, it was Olive's
8192160	8194160	because we were celebrating
8194160	8196160	that she got a gig in an acting thing
8196160	8198160	and she was with her friends to a casino.
8198160	8199160	But I was like,
8199160	8200160	I was just like broke
8200160	8201160	because like,
8202160	8204160	I had like a lot of health bills and shit
8204160	8205160	and so she was like,
8205160	8206160	gave me 50 bucks
8206160	8207160	and I was like,
8207160	8208160	ah, yay!
8208160	8209160	And I was like,
8209160	8210160	I'm going to flip this
8210160	8211160	and give you your 50 bucks back.
8211160	8212160	I lost it.
8215160	8216160	I will never gamble.
8216160	8218160	That shit is terrible.
8223160	8224160	Well, hello there.
8225160	8227160	Obi-Wan Kenobi?
8227160	8228160	Yes.
8229160	8231160	Thanks for visiting me today.
8231160	8233160	I don't want to talk to you!
8234160	8237160	Can I talk to one of the other girls?
8240160	8242160	Can I just buy you a drink?
8242160	8244160	Give me a gin and tonic.
8246160	8247160	Yeah.
8248160	8249160	Can I have some too?
8249160	8251160	No bitch, I'm broke.
8251160	8252160	Fine.
8253160	8254160	I'll buy you some water
8254160	8255160	with ice.
8255160	8256160	How about that?
8257160	8258160	You're getting less semi.
8258160	8260160	You're getting this whatever the fuck this is.
8261160	8262160	Pay some music.
8262160	8263160	Okay.
8263160	8265160	You don't have to relax, okay?
8265160	8266160	Keep your panties on.
8267160	8268160	Turn around.
8269160	8270160	Oh.
8273160	8274160	What?
8276160	8277160	Are you serious?
8281160	8283160	If I don't buy, I swap girl?
8287160	8288160	Damn.
8291160	8294160	Well, I don't want to give my present to you.
8294160	8295160	Because I don't know why,
8295160	8296160	but you kind of just bother me
8296160	8299160	and your boobs are like breathing.
8299160	8301160	How does that even work?
8301160	8302160	I'm breathing right now.
8302160	8304160	I'm looking down at my boobs.
8304160	8306160	My boobs don't separate
8306160	8309160	and have breath in life of their own.
8317160	8319160	This isn't working.
8319160	8320160	Their boobs have lungs.
8320160	8321160	You know, I don't breathe.
8326160	8327160	She's got a bigger chest.
8327160	8328160	My chest is as big as hers.
8328160	8330160	I'm not even fucking joking.
8333160	8335160	Her brain is there too.
8335160	8336160	When I go for a jog,
8336160	8338160	my tit punches me in the face.
8339160	8340160	Okay.
8341160	8342160	Proof?
8342160	8343160	You want proof?
8344160	8345160	Boom.
8346160	8347160	There's your proof.
8349160	8350160	There's your proof.
8351160	8352160	Anyways.
8353160	8354160	Cut the music!
8354160	8355160	Put it back on!
8360160	8362160	Uh, there's food?
8364160	8365160	Aw.
8366160	8368160	I haven't eaten in a couple days.
8369160	8371160	Do you want some edamame?
8377160	8378160	Huh? What's wrong?
8378160	8379160	You seem puzzled.
8379160	8381160	It just seems like you're a broke ass bitch
8381160	8382160	and you only got edamame.
8382160	8383160	So like,
8383160	8386160	why couldn't you have gotten me like sushi or something?
8387160	8388160	Huh?
8389160	8390160	Got it!
8391160	8392160	Haitaku!
8392160	8393160	You're Haitaku!
8393160	8394160	Wow!
8394160	8396160	You forgot my name.
8399160	8401160	Yeah, so that's what you got.
8401160	8402160	You forgot my name
8402160	8404160	and was trying desperately to remember it.
8404160	8405160	That's not...
8405160	8406160	I don't like you.
8406160	8407160	I don't like you.
8408160	8409160	I don't like you.
8410160	8411160	Give me another girl.
8412160	8413160	Customer service here sucks.
8415160	8416160	Can I speak to your manager?
8416160	8417160	Can I speak to your manager?
8418160	8419160	Bring me the manager.
8419160	8421160	Bring me the fucking manager.
8425160	8426160	I want to be a dick.
8426160	8427160	Can I be a dick and just say hi?
8427160	8428160	I'm Kaido.
8428160	8430160	No, because then she's just going to remember my name wrong.
8430160	8432160	Well, I'm never going to talk to her again,
8432160	8433160	so actually I'm Kaido.
8433160	8437160	I was one letter off.
8437160	8439160	I mean, sorry about that.
8439160	8440160	Where are you giggling?
8440160	8442160	Wait, you tricked me!
8442160	8445160	Anyways, dick, don't worry about me.
8445160	8447160	I'll never forget your name anymore.
8447160	8448160	So don't worry, okay?
8448160	8449160	Too late.
8449160	8451160	I am wanting to talk to the girl in blue,
8451160	8453160	so hurry up.
8454160	8456160	Thanks, but no thanks.
8456160	8458160	I'm really sure it's hard for you to remember
8458160	8460160	every customer's name like that.
8460160	8461160	Yeah.
8461160	8463160	Guys kind of all look the same,
8463160	8464160	like unlockable characters,
8464160	8466160	and I wish you had name tags or something.
8466160	8467160	You know, something cute,
8467160	8469160	like what you see a kindergartner wearing.
8471160	8472160	Sorry.
8472160	8474160	I'm only joking, of course.
8474160	8475160	I'm a lollicon.
8475160	8477160	I'm a pro in my field.
8477160	8479160	Remembering names is my specialty.
8482160	8485160	Well, you did remember my name at the same time.
8486160	8488160	Oh, I'm off, so you're still here.
8492160	8494160	Hahaha!
8500160	8503160	I'm actually being faceless fuck.
8507160	8509160	Well, you did seem to remember my name
8509160	8510160	within seconds before.
8510160	8513160	Seems like you're doing great for my eyes.
8513160	8515160	Weird, you don't have any.
8515160	8516160	Yeah, I know.
8516160	8518160	Aw, thanks.
8518160	8519160	You really are kind.
8519160	8521160	Aren't you Haidokun?
8521160	8523160	It's Kaido,
8523160	8525160	like the Vocaloid.
8525160	8527160	I'll make sure to never forget your name.
8528160	8530160	Haidokun, should I get more drinks?
8530160	8532160	I want to keep talking to you more.
8534160	8536160	That's a no for me, dog.
8536160	8538160	When did it get so late?
8538160	8540160	I guess I'll head back soon.
8545160	8546160	Thank you for today.
8546160	8547160	You're fucking broke.
8547160	8548160	See you soon.
8548160	8549160	You can't buy anything.
8550160	8551160	Yeah, thanks for everything.
8551160	8552160	See you soon.
8553160	8554160	We're so poor.
8554160	8556160	Can you get kicked out of Bunny Garden?
8556160	8557160	That would actually be really funny.
8558160	8560160	Yeah, I got paid!
8560160	8562160	Let's fucking go!
8562160	8563160	I got paid!

8568160	8569160	Let's fucking go!
8574160	8576160	With eyes, only one eye is glowing.
8578160	8579160	It's white.
8586160	8587160	I'm buying you all drinks.
8587160	8589160	The whole garden gets drinks!
8590160	8591160	What do you want?
8594160	8595160	No.
8602160	8604160	We're so back, bros.
8604160	8605160	So fucking back.
8606160	8607160	So fucking back.
8607160	8610160	90% of gamblers quit before hitting a big...
8611160	8612160	Shut up.
8615160	8616160	Thanks, boy!
8620160	8622160	I came up with a really bad joke.
8624160	8625160	I'm going to say it anyways.
8625160	8627160	So I'm going to need your mom to come over.
8628160	8629160	And I'm going to trim her hedge.
8629160	8630160	That's all I'm going to say.
8631160	8632160	That's all I'm going to say.
8638160	8639160	Wow.

8649160	8650160	Yes!
8651160	8652160	Okay, what voice?
8652160	8653160	What voice for her?
8654160	8655160	What voice?
8655160	8656160	She's kind of Gyaru.
8656160	8657160	Should we give her a valley accent?
8660160	8661160	After we plant the seed?
8661160	8662160	Exactly.
8662160	8663160	Exactly.
8663160	8664160	This guy fucking gets it.
8665160	8666160	Peppy?
8666160	8667160	Peppy Valley girl?
8667160	8668160	Okay.

8674160	8675160	I'm going to treat you.
8676160	8677160	Sorry.
8677160	8678160	It's like my keyboard.
8679160	8680160	I just won big at gambling.
8680160	8684160	So I'm going to have a buddy trap.
8685160	8686160	Because I like traps.
8686160	8687160	What was that?
8687160	8688160	Don't worry about it.
8691160	8692160	Okay, whatever.
8692160	8694160	Can I have some too?
8695160	8696160	Yeah, I got you baby girl.

8699160	8701160	because I'm going to punch your fart box
8701160	8702160	with my tongue later.
8702160	8703160	Huh?
8703160	8704160	Don't worry about it.
8704160	8706160	I'm sorry.
8706160	8708160	I thought you were going to get it.
8708160	8709160	You wanted to play hide and seek.
8709160	8710160	I'm sorry.
8724160	8725160	I'm sorry.
8725160	8726160	I'm sorry.

8729160	8730160	I'm sorry.
8730160	8731160	I'm sorry.
8731160	8732160	I'm sorry.
8732160	8754800	I want to tongue punch your fart box.
8754800	8755800	Man.
8755800	8763240	Cause I'm gonna just like make clips of just this one, this one, uh, stream, I'm just like
8763240	8774760	all the dumb ass shit I'm saying, uh, hold on, take a sip.
8774760	8782640	I was in your tea, it's literally only chamomile in mint, in lavender, I'm eating, I'm drinking
8782640	8788000	the sleepy time tea, uh, that you lovely bitches got me off the throne, thank you so much, it's
8788000	8789000	my favorite tea.
8789000	8792920	Usually I take it to fall asleep, but I don't feel like taking the throat coat for my throat,
8792920	8796600	cause I've been talking this entire week, and last week.
8796600	8798240	So I'm drinking this instead, it's very tasty.
8798240	8799240	It's not caffeinated.
8799240	8800240	How am I holding up?
8800240	8801240	I'm holding up good.
8801240	8802240	I'm having a great time.
8802240	8803240	I can take a shot.
8803240	8804240	You guys want me, should we take a shot?
8804240	8805240	You guys want to take a shot?
8805240	8806240	You guys want to take a shot?
8806240	8807240	I got Tito's.
8807240	8814920	Should we get a lady titi?
8814920	8821540	Should we make this a drunk stream?
8821540	8822540	Sounds good.
8822540	8824400	Take a shot, take a shot.
8824400	8826680	Part in the jar, what?
8826680	8830280	Just shot of Tito's.
8830280	8833080	I don't have a lime to chase it though.
8833080	8836400	Let's do it, let's fucking do it.
8836400	8838120	Oh my god, Rina, I was rolled over you.
8838120	8840320	Hi, what's up?

8846440	8848440	Hey, mamas, how you doing?
8848440	8850220	Why are you wet?
8852000	8852960	Her chest is wet,
8852960	8854800	cause she sometimes like sticks her whole entire
8854800	8856960	fucking body into the water bowl.
8856960	8857960	A water fountain.
8860680	8862600	Here, you want some cat purrs?
8862600	8864440	Hold on, let me switch off the desktop audio
8864440	8865840	so you can hear her purring.
8867080	8868480	Cat purrs and shots?
8883120	8884280	Yeah, she's my big mama.
8885840	8887560	You trying to stop me from taking a shot?
8887560	8889280	Cause you're not gonna, Rina.
8889280	8892600	Anyways, let me just get up and be in worse fear.
8893600	8897600	I just thought of that side talk.
8897600	8902080	Do you remember like the big gong guy,
8902080	8904480	like the same side talk guys?
8904480	8906680	I just think of that fucking,
8906680	8908240	the black dude on the street,
8908240	8909880	is like talking to a homeless chick.
8909880	8911280	He's like, you want a shot?
8911280	8912240	You want a shot?
8912240	8913080	You want a shot?
8915640	8916720	I fucking love that clip.
8916720	8917720	So funny, buddy.
8919200	8920040	Oh my god.
8921040	8924040	Wow, do I have a shot glass?
8926640	8928280	I only got a little bit of...
8936080	8939160	We drinking straight from the bottle, bros.
8939160	8941680	Cause I don't throw in my shot glass one.
8943600	8944520	You want a shot?
8944520	8945440	You want a shot?
8946520	8948880	Drink from my Oshie mark, like my shoe?
8951040	8953480	Can you guess what it is?
8953480	8954760	Just Tito's vodka.
8956080	8958680	80 proof, 40% alcohol.
8963520	8967480	Oh dear lord heaven, we are so Barak Obama.
8967480	8968680	Hello, Barak Obama.
8970600	8971520	You want a shot?
8971520	8972360	You want a shot?
8972360	8974720	I want you to look up that clip right now
8974720	8977400	and picture me saying that to you.
8978240	8981040	And that, you know, like that,
8983240	8985560	that like Pennywise the clown,
8985560	8988400	when he takes a, he's about to take a drink of something
8988400	8990240	and he just like flicks the cap off.
8991520	8992440	I can't do it.
8992440	8993560	Oh, perfect.
8993560	8995360	Oh shit, I dropped it.
8995360	8996320	And then he just swigs it.
8996320	8997600	That's what I'm gonna do.
9000920	9001760	Woo!
9007480	9011640	Oh my God, that tingled my fucking nipples.

9035400	9038120	Madam, I offer all my worldly possessions
9038120	9039520	to you smiling face.
9041880	9044600	All right, can I have your clothes?
9044600	9045440	Give me your shoes.
9045440	9046280	I like your shoes.
9046280	9047400	Are we the same size?
9047400	9048240	Yeah, I'll take those two.
9048240	9049080	Thank you.
9049080	9049920	Appreciate it.
9049920	9050760	Thank you, Charlie.
9056920	9060560	Ooh, I'm gonna sleep well tonight.

9068960	9069960	You want a shot?
9069960	9070960	You want a shot?
9075960	9076960	Pew, pew!
9076960	9077960	Pew, pew!
9077960	9078960	Pew, pew!
9079960	9081960	Oh, that was a Tito's burp.
9085400	9087400	I need your clothes in return.
9087400	9088240	No.
9089840	9091160	I own you.
9091160	9093640	I own you, okay?
9093640	9094640	In your mouth.
9096280	9098040	I'm almost, I fucking love you.
9099280	9100120	I'm almost a reveal bunch.
9100120	9101440	Match up my energy right now.
9106200	9107040	That's what I was referencing.
9107040	9108280	I was referencing PsyTalk.
9110600	9113320	You can't pull out the gun every time you drink.
9113320	9115080	Who fucking said I can't?
9115080	9117920	I do what I want, when I want it.
9118880	9120600	I'm now eating applesauce.
9123080	9124600	Me eating a bogey squeeze.
9126240	9129160	If you're gonna drink with me,
9129160	9131200	make sure you hydrate and eat something.
9135520	9137400	This is America.
9137400	9138560	Don't get you stripping.
9138560	9140840	Stripping, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
9140840	9145080	I'm so happy because today I discovered
9145080	9147240	when I was listening to the new Caitranada album
9147240	9150040	that challenged Gambino and Caitranada
9150040	9151760	made a fucking song together
9151760	9153800	and I literally was praying
9154800	9156840	to the gods above in the universe for that
9156840	9159040	and it happened and it was great.
9159040	9160360	And then they did a pink pantherist
9160360	9161880	and I was like, holy fucking shit.
9166120	9167240	PsyTalk vid.
9168640	9169960	Hmm.
9169960	9170800	Probably.
9170800	9172640	Baby a triple.
9172640	9176120	Anonymous tipped $3.33.
9176120	9178880	He said face red heart shape.
9178880	9179720	Bebe.
9180720	9183760	I think probably.
9183760	9186120	Okay, no, pray for me to be debt free.
9186120	9187360	Pray, I'll pray for all of us.
9187360	9188200	I'm praying.
9189400	9191600	Oh universe.
9191600	9195120	Oh, God's above, please let us all be debt free.
9195120	9198280	Please let us all win the lottery.
9198280	9199120	Thank you.
9200760	9201680	Inshallah.
9202680	9203520	God willing.
9204960	9206480	I fucking love pink panthers.
9207080	9207920	Amen.
9209000	9210880	And so it shall be.
9210880	9212040	And so it might be.
9214480	9216880	I forget the Hebrew way to say amen.
9216880	9218480	Or is that, is amen already Hebrew?
9218480	9219480	I don't fucking know.
9220480	9222480	That is a prison and gambling is the key.
9222480	9223480	Time to gamble.
9225480	9227040	Pray that taxes are abolished.
9227040	9227880	No taxes.
9227880	9229240	Actually, no, tax are rich.
9231640	9233440	All right, take another swig.
9233440	9234280	Hold on.
9234440	9236640	Any music, any music, any music,
9236640	9238240	any music for a second.
9240240	9241840	I mean, I don't know.
9241840	9244840	Sorry, I'm gonna be a 12-kiss for a second.
9250840	9253840	I get claimed, but I only do a couple seconds.
9256840	9258840	I'm doing it from my phone.
9259600	9261940	I'm doing it from my phone.
9268400	9269400	AHHHHHH!!
9270400	9271400	AHHHHHHHH!!
9274400	9277400	UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH!
9277400	9279400	We're the capitol.
9281400	9282400	Mmm.
9283400	9284400	Hold on.
9286400	9287400	Wait, no!
9288840	9295840	Okay, we're good.
9295840	9304840	Howdy mate, how's it going?
9304840	9306840	How you doing?
9306840	9307840	Stop!
9307840	9310840	I can't find the cat.
9310840	9311840	No cat.
9311840	9316840	Go away, girl, go!
9317840	9321840	I'm scared, did you just...
9321840	9322840	What the fuck, what do you mean?
9322840	9325840	What the fuck is going on?
9325840	9326840	What?
9326840	9327840	What?
9327840	9335840	Okay, I took two swigs of my Tito's.
9335840	9338840	I am feeling a whore.
9338840	9339840	Here's a present.
9339840	9341840	I just met you, but this is crazy.
9341840	9342840	Here's some socks.
9342840	9345840	So wear them, maybe.
9345840	9348840	If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?
9348840	9350840	I just want you to like it.
9350840	9353840	Please wear them.
9353840	9357840	I'm gonna buy one to wear next.
9357840	9360840	I got something good.
9360840	9361840	Wait, hold on.
9361840	9366840	Wait a sec, you're pretty cute, but why are you curled up in a ball, sir?
9366840	9371840	How the fuck am I curled up in a ball at the counter, but okay.
9371840	9372840	What's wrong?
9372840	9374840	You must be nervous.
9374840	9375840	That's no good.
9375840	9378840	Getting nervous over me is just a waste of energy.
9378840	9381840	Oh, hello, my name is Hito Kanda.
9381840	9383840	It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
9383840	9385840	That's disgusting.
9385840	9387840	Don't burp in my face again.
9387840	9390840	You started introducing yourself, you fucking weirdo.
9390840	9393840	Well then, I will too.
9393840	9395840	Hello, I am Rin.
9395840	9396840	Sorry to trouble you.
9396840	9397840	What am I doing?
9397840	9399840	Is this how it's supposed to go?
9399840	9403840	So, what do you do?
9403840	9404840	Hi Chan.
9404840	9407840	Do you call me how she calls me Chan?
9407840	9413840	Well, right now I'm assisting an acquaintance with their job.
9413840	9416840	But until recently...
9416840	9418840	Thank you, Charlie.
9418840	9419840	Thank you, Charlie.
9419840	9421840	It's too late.
9421840	9423840	I wear an eye patch.
9423840	9426840	IRL and my medical bills are astronomical.
9426840	9430840	I think the prayer is too late.
9430840	9432840	Jesus fuck.
9432840	9434840	I'm sorry.
9434840	9439840	I hope that can be recovered for you.
9439840	9444840	So fuck.
9444840	9448840	Uh...
9448840	9450840	Yeah, stop.
9450840	9453840	There are even tags on your pyres, bro.
9453840	9456840	You're so fucking out of poker for that.
9456840	9459840	Honestly, eye patches are badass, though.
9459840	9465840	There's this one governor, I think, in America that was a former military veteran.
9465840	9467840	He wears an eye patch and he looks fucking cool.
9467840	9469840	And you can pretend you're solid snakes sometimes.
9469840	9472840	So...
9472840	9474840	That's good. I hope it goes well.
9474840	9476840	Thank you for the tip.
9476840	9478840	I need to scratch my nose.
9478840	9481840	But until recently, I was employed at a company.
9481840	9485840	However, due to a plethora of mistakes, I was terminated.
9485840	9488840	Is there even a word for plethora in Japanese?
9488840	9490840	Hang on. Hi, Tom.
9490840	9494840	I can't keep up with all that formal speech. Stop being a fucking weirdo.
9494840	9498840	I'd be super grateful if you could just, like, talk normally, please.
9498840	9500840	Like, what is this?
9500840	9502840	I'm moving my hands around. You can't tell.
9502840	9505840	Yes, it's called plethora.
9505840	9508840	Oh, really? I'll drop the pretenses then.
9508840	9511840	Thank you. You're such a nice guy, hi, Tom.
9511840	9515840	Even if you're too formal and weird sometimes, it's their loss for firing you.
9515840	9517840	You're better off without them.
9517840	9520840	No, they treated me pretty well.
9520840	9522840	But I'm kidding, bye, okay now.
9522840	9525840	I gambled the other day and I did well.
9525840	9528840	Wow, you're really something, hi, Tom.
9528840	9531840	You don't badmouth them even after getting fired.
9531840	9534840	I respect that. You know, you're for real, for real.
9534840	9538840	No cap. Facts, no printer, ink.
9538840	9540840	What the fuck did you just say?
9540840	9543840	You're a stand-up guy. You must get that a lot, huh?
9547840	9549840	I don't get that at all.
9549840	9552840	They do. Let me hear some more.
9552840	9554840	Let me hear some more.
9554840	9556840	Can you feed my ego?
9556840	9558840	Can you feed my ego, please?
9558840	9562840	You're such a kind, upstanding person, hi, Chen.
9562840	9566840	It's true. I just met you. We've only talked once.
9566840	9569840	You're really kind of fucking weird, but sure.
9569840	9573840	You know, you're so kind and upstanding.
9573840	9575840	I already said that.
9575840	9577840	You already said that.
9577840	9580840	Yeah, but you're kind and upstanding, okay?
9580840	9582840	Oh, hey, let me tell you something.
9582840	9587840	I'm serious. Well, I'm always serious, but I'm seriously, serious.
9587840	9590840	Are you okay?
9590840	9593840	A new people is really important, right? In life, I mean.
9593840	9597840	Online, you know.
9597840	9600840	So I'm really grateful to have met you, hi, Chen.
9600840	9605840	I may be far from perfect, but I'll still do the very best I can.
9605840	9608840	Hope you're ready. I'm gonna sit on your face.
9608840	9610840	So what?
9610840	9613840	Um, sorry, I didn't mean to say that. Ellipses.
9613840	9616840	How embarrassing. What am I saying?
9616840	9619840	Sit on your face. That was so forward of me.
9619840	9622840	Well, you get the idea. Did you catch all that?
9622840	9625840	I'm not saying it again. I'm gonna sit on your face.
9625840	9628840	By the way, the other girls here will also sit on your face,
9628840	9632840	and they're really nice too. I think you'll like this shop a lot.
9632840	9637840	If you find that I'm not your type after talking to me a few times,
9637840	9640840	feel free to slide up to the next row and sit,
9640840	9643840	or you can have us both at once.
9644840	9649840	I'm not the type of girl who's bothered by that sort of thing to be, you know,
9649840	9653840	with another girl and a guy. I'm bi, you know.
9653840	9657840	I'm pretty fluid. I don't believe in labels, actually.
9657840	9660840	Uh, can you, can we change the subject?
9660840	9664840	Fine. Well, on the other hand, if you do find that I'm your type,
9664840	9667840	it'd make me pretty happy.
9667840	9669840	Well, I'll leave it at that.
9669840	9673840	So, like, do you want to have a threesome or...?
9673840	9677840	I didn't pay for that kind of service.
9677840	9680840	It's on the house. Just say fucking yes.
9680840	9683840	I don't think I'm comfortable with that.
9683840	9685840	Sorry.
9685840	9690840	Um, anyways, I look forward to serving you or whatever, I guess.
9690840	9695840	Don't fucking threesome with me and the girl in the blue fucking bitch.
9695840	9698840	Bet you watch his worst head tie.
9698840	9699840	What did you say?
9699840	9704840	I can! How about drinks? Do you want a bit more? Should I get you something?
9704840	9706840	Uh, no, I'm good.
9706840	9708840	When did it get so late?
9708840	9710840	I should head back soon.
9720840	9722840	I don't know.
9723840	9727840	If you can please the cast members in the shop.
9729840	9730840	I'm gonna leave my eyebrows.
9730840	9733840	They'll see you out in a good mood when you leave.
9733840	9737840	Haito, who is sent off, is more motivated to work and had...
9737840	9739840	What the fuck?
9741840	9744840	Thank you for today! See you soon!
9744840	9746840	Yeah, thank you for today.
9746840	9750840	So, about that threesome, so I'm meeting the other girl, like, in like an hour?
9750840	9752840	Did you want to, like...
9752840	9755840	I gotta get home. I have work tomorrow.
9755840	9756840	But it's Sunday.
9756840	9758840	Uh, yeah.
9758840	9759840	Over time.
9759840	9761840	Later.
9767840	9768840	I don't know if you guys heard her meow.
9768840	9770840	She went, meow.
9771840	9772840	She's in my lap.
9777840	9780840	I got to drink some delicious alcohol and have fun conversations.
9780840	9782840	Now I'm motivated for work.
9787840	9790840	Um...
9796840	9798840	Okay, I don't know what the fuck that is.
9798840	9800840	Let's buy another thing.
9803840	9807840	I'm gonna buy some macarons for the blue black-haired girl.
9816840	9818840	Now's my time to rest up and recover.
9818840	9821840	This is the only place that can heal my mind.
9824840	9826840	Oh, fuck, it's this bitch again.
9826840	9829840	What? Oh, you came! Thanks!
9829840	9830840	I...
9830840	9832840	Clean up after yourself next time.
9832840	9834840	That's all I'm gonna say.
9834840	9836840	Um, what drink did you want?
9837840	9839840	I don't want to hang out with you.
9839840	9841840	Can I, like...
9841840	9843840	Not buy anything?
9843840	9845840	Cause I don't want to talk to you.
9845840	9847840	I'm gonna get a blueberry liquor.
9847840	9849840	Cause that sounds tasty.
9851840	9853840	Can I have some too? No bitch.
9853840	9855840	I want to talk to the girl in blue.
9859840	9861840	A customer called me so I better get going.
9861840	9863840	No one else is fucking here.
9864840	9866840	I get it, you're embarrassed.
9866840	9868840	I want to talk to the blue girl.
9870840	9871840	Can I...
9871840	9873840	She just fucking walked in place.
9873840	9875840	I don't want to talk to you either!
9875840	9877840	Let me talk to her!
9881840	9883840	Okay, I'll just get some food.
9887840	9888840	Damn.
9888840	9890840	This makes me hungry.
9890840	9892840	I need to eat dinner.
9898840	9900840	What is a geo?
9900840	9901840	Ailo?
9901840	9903840	A jello?
9911840	9913840	You want some cheese and crackers?
9913840	9915840	You want some salami?
9915840	9917840	I can give you a hard salami.
9917840	9919840	Um...
9919840	9921840	Uh, like, no thanks.
9921840	9922840	Alright, fine.
9922840	9924840	I guess we'll just be french fries.
9926840	9929840	Thank God, this tastes so good!
9930840	9932840	I'm glad you came back, thinkies!
9932840	9934840	Have you been good?
9934840	9937840	Yeah, you seem like you're in a good mood too, ranchon.
9938840	9939840	How do you know my name?
9939840	9941840	I don't... oh no, she did introduce herself, nevermind.
9942840	9943840	Girl dinner.
9944840	9946840	When do you get the sushi off of her?
9946840	9948840	Ooh, so like...
9948840	9951840	Is there gonna be an option on the menu where I can eat sushi off your body?
9951840	9953840	Sorry, I hit the microphone.
9954840	9956840	Um, we don't do that store to service here.
9956840	9958840	This place fucking blows!
9959840	9961840	Where's my happy ending?
9962840	9964840	What good would I be if I couldn't put on a smile?
9964840	9966840	I'm ignoring that.
9966840	9967840	Hmm?
9967840	9969840	Yeah, my neighbors are walking by.
9969840	9972840	You actually don't look like you're feeling so great yourself.
9973840	9974840	Really?
9974840	9976840	I'm feeling fine physically today.
9976840	9978840	And I don't have any problems.
9978840	9980840	Hmm, you look shitty.
9980840	9981840	That's all I'm gonna say, buddy.
9981840	9983840	Did you shower?
9983840	9985840	You smell like you haven't showered.
9985840	9986840	You sure?
9986840	9988840	Nope, but you're definitely not feeling good.
9988840	9990840	Not at all.
9990840	9993840	This is a bad omen, you know.
9993840	9994840	Get it?
9994840	9996840	Today's fortune?
9996840	9999840	You know what would make the bad omen go away?
9999840	10002840	If you buy me a better drink.
10003840	10005840	Or some sushi.
10005840	10009840	Or if you have that threesome I keep talking to you about, you know, I never mind you smell bad.
10009840	10012840	Me and girl in blue don't wanna fuck you anyways.
10013840	10018840	When does this should be real-time phantom stream?
10018840	10020840	See?
10020840	10024840	Japanese honorifics and the F-boy voice is so good.
10024840	10026840	Can I start saying thankies?
10026840	10028840	Oh my god, thankies!
10030840	10032840	But hey sir, you're lucky.
10032840	10034840	In fact, I can judge based on your name.
10034840	10035840	Wanna try?
10035840	10039840	Oh fuck, you're one of those numerology astrology bitches.
10039840	10040840	Fuck, crazy bitch.
10040840	10041840	What?
10041840	10043840	Nothing, sure.
10043840	10046840	Like, fortune telling with names?
10046840	10049840	Sure, I'll give it a try.
10049840	10051840	Okay, okay, I know your name already.
10051840	10054840	You told me what it was last time, right?
10054840	10060840	Did you forget my fucking name and you're just stalling for me to say it?
10060840	10063840	Yeah, I introduce myself to you.
10063840	10068840	Right, I know it, I know it, I know it, but I need to know how it's spelled.
10068840	10070840	Let's see the fortune telling.
10070840	10072840	You are so full of shit.
10072840	10074840	No, I'm not.
10074840	10076840	I pooped this morning.
10076840	10080840	How do you spell your name in kanji?
10084840	10086840	I am haito, it's kan-
10086840	10088840	Why would I just say my last name?
10088840	10090840	Why would I say my filming name?
10090840	10093840	I could be an ass and say it's spelled in hiragana.
10093840	10098840	I'll tease her.
10098840	10101840	I want my birth chart.
10101840	10104840	Like, I don't want a free threesome bra.
10104840	10107840	I'm like uber uncomfortable with that.
10107840	10110840	Oh, like, I don't want a threesome bra.
10110840	10112840	I'm like uber uncomfortable with that.
10112840	10115840	I only do threesome with my bros.
10115840	10117840	I feel tower.
10117840	10119840	Each other.
10119840	10120840	Huh?
10120840	10121840	Nothing.
10121840	10123840	It's kanda.
10123840	10128840	Right, but what I want to know is your first name.
10128840	10132840	I don't think I called you by your first name last time.
10132840	10136840	You literally gave me a female honorific because you're a bitch.
10136840	10140840	First, the character is for cup in person, then dry in field.
10140840	10142840	That's how you spell haito kanda.
10142840	10144840	Remember now?
10144840	10146840	You got me, huh?
10146840	10148840	I totally forgot your name.
10148840	10150840	I'm really sorry.
10150840	10153840	Okay, I found a way online.
10153840	10154840	I'm one of those.
10154840	10158840	Oh my god, witch talk is so helpful to learn someone's name after you forget it.
10158840	10161840	It's said to offer to tell their fortune with it.
10161840	10162840	Clever, huh?
10162840	10164840	But how did you figure it out?
10164840	10169840	Was it acting suspicious?
10169840	10172840	These girls are annoying me.
10172840	10176840	You seem like the type of person who can't tell a lie, French Anne,
10176840	10179840	but you kind of just technically lied by a mission.
10179840	10182840	It was written all your face how you were acting.
10182840	10183840	I get it.
10183840	10187840	People usually tell me they can read me like an open book.
10187840	10189840	I live honestly.
10189840	10192840	It's so tiring to cover up stuff with lies.
10192840	10197840	It's easier just to be honest and then apologize when you get scolded.
10197840	10198840	I'm sorry.
10198840	10199840	Hi, Chan.
10199840	10201840	You told me your name, but I forgot it.
10201840	10203840	And then I tried to pull the wool over your eyes.
10203840	10205840	I'm really sorry.
10205840	10210840	So what are you going to do to make up for it?
10210840	10213840	What do you mean?
10213840	10215840	I'd like my happy ending, please.
10215840	10218840	I'd like to order one happy ending.
10218840	10220840	Get on your knees.
10220840	10221840	Come on.
10221840	10222840	No, I can't.
10222840	10224840	We're at work.
10224840	10227840	I'm asking politely.
10227840	10229840	I know where you live.
10229840	10230840	Okay.
10230840	10233840	Can I do it later?
10233840	10234840	Fine.
10234840	10237840	Sorry, I got...
10251840	10252840	I'm sorry.
10252840	10254840	I forgot where I was.
10254840	10256840	Hido just took over me.
10256840	10259840	I don't even...
10259840	10260840	This va...
10260840	10262840	Why would the va be dead?
10262840	10264840	Well, aren't you funny?
10264840	10266840	Thank you, Anonymous.
10266840	10267840	Appreciate you.
10267840	10268840	Man, that's crazy.
10268840	10270840	Even more money for the lovely Madden Sheehan.
10270840	10274840	Man, that's crazy.
10274840	10275840	You want the type ending?
10275840	10276840	I don't know.
10276840	10278840	I know what it is.
10278840	10279840	I don't think it was Hido.
10279840	10286840	I said hi to.
10286840	10290840	I never thought I wanted to be in top of this game, but here we are.
10290840	10292840	I can't tell if it's from the game or what it is.
10292840	10295840	I'm probably not actually watching.
10295840	10296840	Stalker is.
10296840	10300840	I learned from Mercy.
10300840	10304840	Make myself a little bit bigger.
10304840	10307840	There we go.
10307840	10308840	Block that girl's ass.
10308840	10309840	You guys can't see.
10309840	10313840	Only I can see.
10313840	10314840	I scare you?
10314840	10315840	It's good.
10315840	10317840	You should be scared.
10317840	10318840	It's all right.
10318840	10320840	She didn't bother me at all.
10320840	10321840	For real?
10321840	10322840	Yay.
10322840	10329840	Well, then let's get back and have some fun.
10329840	10333840	So lay back.
10333840	10337840	I'll find all and butt in your pants for you.
10337840	10340840	Wow.
10340840	10342840	That's really small.
10342840	10344840	Hey, I'm just.
10344840	10345840	It's just.
10345840	10347840	I'm not worked up yet.
10347840	10348840	Okay.
10348840	10353840	All right, well.
10353840	10358840	Here it goes.
10358840	10368840	It's cold in here.
10368840	10374840	Sir, it's heated to 73 degrees in here.
10374840	10376840	You're sweating.
10376840	10381840	Yeah, I will.
10381840	10383840	That's really pathetic.
10383840	10384840	All right.
10384840	10388840	Fuck you.
10388840	10391840	I'm just gonna fuck it.
10391840	10397840	Well, I'll go extra hard today to make up for my screw up with your names.
10397840	10400840	I won't insult you anymore.
10400840	10401840	You're still drinking.
10401840	10403840	Hi, Chan.
10403840	10404840	Drinking to forget.
10404840	10406840	Careful not to overdo it.
10406840	10407840	Okay.
10407840	10409840	Please, someone get this guy out of here.
10409840	10412840	His dick is so small.
10412840	10414840	I'm leaving.
10414840	10415840	Wow.
10415840	10416840	It's already this way.
10416840	10417840	Wipes tears from face.
10417840	10418840	Oh, are you?
10418840	10419840	I'm at home.
10419840	10421840	Charlie spur tipped four dollars and 20 cents.
10421840	10422840	Thank you again, Charlie.
10422840	10423840	No, it's average sized.
10423840	10424840	I swear.
10424840	10426840	Don't make fun of me, madam.
10426840	10429840	Loudly crying.
10429840	10433840	Why are you guys so tiny?
10433840	10439840	How is anybody supposed to work with that?
10439840	10445840	I'll head back home.
10445840	10448840	Bigger when you pull on it.
10448840	10450840	Thank you for today.
10450840	10452840	I have to brush my teeth.
10452840	10453840	Taste it like cigarettes.
10453840	10456840	See you soon.
10456840	10457840	Yeah.
10457840	10459840	Thanks for everything.
10459840	10461840	Didn't even get to come.
10461840	10470840	See you soon.
10470840	10473840	Oh, fuck.
10473840	10478840	Oh, you know what this means.
10478840	10480840	I wish this had more banger music.
10480840	10494840	Oh, banger music, guys.
10494840	10495840	Okay.
10495840	10497840	Sometimes the eyes glow and sometimes they don't.
10497840	10499840	When it's red, it means I lost.
10499840	10500840	Oh, fuck.
10500840	10502840	We're going to do it again.
10502840	10504840	We got money to spend.
10504840	10506840	Oh, when it glows one eye, we win.
10506840	10507840	I'm pretty sure.
10507840	10511840	It turns white or not.
10511840	10514840	It does not.
10514840	10515840	Oh, I did win.
10515840	10517840	Yeah.
10517840	10521840	Let's do it again.
10521840	10524840	Something more impressive when you measure in millimeters.
10524840	10526840	I lost again.
10526840	10528840	Oh, baby.
10528840	10529840	Oh, baby.
10529840	10530840	A triple.
10530840	10532840	$3.33.
10532840	10533840	Thank you.
10533840	10534840	Just a tip.
10534840	10535840	Thank you for the tip.
10535840	10537840	Thank you for the tip.
10537840	10540840	I lost again.
10540840	10542840	God damn it.
10542840	10546840	I won.
10546840	10547840	I didn't win that much though.
10547840	10548840	Okay.
10548840	10553840	If you get the one red glowing eye and white screen, you win big.
10553840	10558840	But if you just get a no glowing eyes and white screen, you kind of win a little bit.
10558840	10562840	But if you get two glowing red eyes, you lost badly.
10562840	10571840	And if you get no glowing red eyes, you lost a small amount.
10571840	10572840	One red glowing eye.
10572840	10573840	It's lost like a medium amount.
10573840	10574840	Okay.
10574840	10576840	Oh, baby.
10576840	10580840	A triple.
10580840	10583840	It should be just like me when the high energy drinks longer does it.
10583840	10584840	Oh my God.
10584840	10589840	I need to feel alive.
10589840	10590840	I know.
10590840	10591840	I need to gain the system.
10591840	10592840	Fuck that.
10592840	10594840	We're not gaming the system.
10594840	10596840	I didn't read that.
10596840	10598840	It's fine.
10598840	10603840	No, I want to talk to the blue girl.
10603840	10606840	Get these bitches out of my face.
10606840	10607840	Oh, you came.
10607840	10608840	I'm glad.
10608840	10611840	I have to change my outfit now.
10611840	10616840	What drink did you want?
10616840	10619840	What are you buying?
10619840	10620840	What are you selling?
10620840	10624840	I'm feeling crazy.
10624840	10626840	Can I have some too?
10626840	10629840	Are we splitting it?
10629840	10630840	Fine.
10630840	10631840	I'll get you.
10631840	10637840	I'll get you a highball.
10637840	10638840	It tastes amazing.
10638840	10643840	I love this.
10643840	10646840	Are you wearing the same panties?
10646840	10648840	Girl, change your underwear.
10648840	10655840	I'll give you the macarons, I guess.
10655840	10658840	Here you go.
10658840	10661840	If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?
10661840	10664840	I swear I didn't put razors in them.
10664840	10666840	I swear.
10666840	10667840	Just don't look.
10667840	10669840	Just close your eyes when you eat them.
10669840	10671840	I hope you like it.
10671840	10673840	Wow, thanks.
10673840	10675840	I'll take care of...
10688840	10693840	How'd those get in there?
10693840	10697840	Why did you put razors in this?
10697840	10698840	You good?
10698840	10700840	Did nobody get my bit?
10700840	10702840	They weren't paying attention.
10702840	10703840	You seem happy.
10703840	10705840	Did something happen?
10705840	10708840	Did you guys think I actually hurt myself?
10708840	10710840	Well, you came all this way to...
10710840	10711840	Oh, sorry.
10711840	10713840	Frog in my throat.
10713840	10715840	Well, you came all this way to visit me.
10715840	10717840	Of course I'm happy.
10717840	10721840	Thanks, but you seem much happier than usual.
10721840	10722840	I'm not.
10722840	10727840	I just swallowed a razor, but we have medical concerns, so I'll be okay.
10727840	10733840	Maybe it's because I really got some time to relax during my time off recently.
10733840	10737840	You used your days off to the fullest, then.
10737840	10740840	Did you go shopping?
10740840	10743840	I mostly shop online these days.
10743840	10749840	I'm a neat, except I need to go to this job so I can make money,
10749840	10752840	because I like to play gotcha.
10752840	10753840	Why are you telling me all this?
10753840	10755840	Because you fucking asked.
10755840	10759840	But sometimes going around different stores and looking at what they have
10759840	10761840	makes me feel super excited.
10761840	10766840	I played with my dog for the whole day less.
10766840	10769840	Naughty, naughty, you teasing me?
10769840	10773840	Naughty, naughty.
10773840	10776840	Oh, you have a dog?
10776840	10778840	Oh, hi, Meryl.
10778840	10788840	Meryl.
10788840	10793840	She plays Blue Archive.
10793840	10797840	Hello.
10797840	10799840	Hello, Meryl.
10799840	10804840	My sweet little, cute, fishy.
10804840	10815540	Uh-huh, he's a chihuahua, he's a Chihuahua called Wawa, you mean a Chihuahua?
10815540	10819620	Yeah, whatever, he's super cute.
10819620	10823900	And when you call him Wawa Chin, he waxes his tail and comes to you.
10823900	10828060	When he sleeps, it's always next to me too.
10828060	10832540	He loves walks too, so I take him to this really big park near my place whenever I get
10832540	10833540	a dig off.
10833740	10836980	That's what we did last time too.
10836980	10838540	So you just hang out with your dog?
10838540	10839540	Yeah.
10839540	10841900	That sounds great or whatever.
10841900	10844140	I love dogs too.
10844140	10845140	Really?
10845140	10849140	Yeah, I have a husky golden retriever mix.
10849140	10852140	That's fucked.
10852140	10858820	Well, I hope you give Wawa Chin a nice pat if you ever come around.
10858820	10861740	I'm sure you'll end up joining his company too.
10861740	10867740	No, she blame it on the alcohol.
10867740	10872940	We know her routine, we can go mercy mode now.
10872940	10874940	I know, she's giving up a lot of information.
10874940	10877940	No, no, no, no, no.
10877940	10881940	That's why her color is red.
10881940	10882940	Oh my god.
10882940	10885340	Do you think he'd be fine to run?
10885340	10886340	Why are you?
10886340	10891700	This is like the third time I've talked to you and you're like, I need to meet my
10891700	10892700	dog.
10892700	10895100	Do you think he'd be fine around me though?
10895100	10900540	I wonder if he'll think I was trying to take his master away from him because I have a
10900540	10902980	question to ask you.
10902980	10907700	Will you be my master or my mistress?
10907700	10908700	What?
10908700	10909700	Never mind.
10909700	10913700	How are those socks?
10913700	10916700	You gave them to the other girl.
10916700	10917700	Who knows?
10917700	10919100	That could happen.
10919100	10922400	Wawa Chin loves me so much after all.
10922400	10924100	You're trying to seal me away.
10924100	10925100	Huh?
10925100	10926100	What's wrong?
10926100	10929100	I'm just trying to buy your affections.
10929100	10931400	Uh, nothing at all.
10931400	10933500	I'm feeling a little sweaty right now actually.
10933500	10936100	God, I wonder what's wrong with me.
10936100	10937100	Ugh.
10937100	10938100	Are you good?
10938100	10939500	Sorry, it's my lush.
10939500	10944100	I mean, you want a drink?
10944100	10948100	Uh, I think I'm good.
10949100	10951100	Is your dog like chocolate?
10959100	10961100	Oh, she came and said hi to me.
10961100	10964100	I'll be waiting for you, so please come again.
10964100	10966100	Yeah, thank you for today.
10966100	10968100	Fucking weirdo.
10969100	10972100	I hear her boobs jiggle when she waves.
10972100	10974100	Like, your boob- wait, actually.
10974100	10975100	I'm waving my hand.
10975100	10977100	Are my boobs jiggling?
10977100	10978100	Hold it.
10979100	10981100	What's that buzzing noise?
10981100	10983100	Don't worry about it.
10985100	10987100	It's air conditioning.
10987100	10989100	It's the AC.
10993100	10996100	Okay, we had a good fun conversation.
10996100	10999100	I'm looking forward to going to work now.
11004100	11006100	Can I, like, what is this thing?
11006100	11008100	Okay, I don't know what that means.
11008100	11010100	Um, I should save.
11010100	11011100	I'll save.
11013100	11015100	Like, how do they dance in the corner?
11017100	11018100	Um.
11020100	11023100	Okay, there's not a lot to do in this game,
11023100	11025100	and it's kind of annoying.
11025100	11028100	I'm like, uh, okay, so I get the gifts, I talk.
11028100	11030100	Is that really it?
11033100	11035100	I don't think AC sounds like that.
11035100	11037100	Don't worry about it.
11038100	11040100	Come on, give me white screen.
11040100	11041100	Fuck.
11042100	11043100	What should I lose?
11043100	11044100	Oh!
11044100	11046100	Oh, give me a red screen and I run?
11046100	11047100	Okay.
11047100	11050100	Okay, okay, my strat is totally wrong then.
11050100	11052100	Usually, I thought the thing would give an indicator,
11052100	11054100	but it really doesn't.
11062100	11064100	Bro, what the f-
11065100	11066100	Okay.
11077100	11078100	Okay.
11078100	11079100	That's fine.
11081100	11083100	No longer yippee.
11083100	11086100	Uh, buy some perfume,
11086100	11089100	because I want to know what she smells like,
11089100	11092100	and so I can buy the same perfume and we can,
11092100	11095100	I can spray it on my pillowcase
11095100	11097100	and pretend I'm sleeping next to her.
11097100	11098100	What should I drink today?
11098100	11100100	Beer, wine, champagne?
11100100	11101100	Let's just get in there first.
11101100	11102100	Go!
11103100	11104100	Sorry, jumpscare.
11105100	11109100	Please, can I talk to the girl in blue?
11111100	11113100	Thanks for visiting me today.
11113100	11115100	Can I please talk to that bitch over there?
11115100	11116100	It's all I want.
11118100	11120100	She has a fatter ass than you.
11120100	11121100	Um, okay.
11121100	11123100	Well, what drink did you want?
11124100	11126100	Uh, I'm feeling spicy today.
11128100	11130100	I'm gonna get the Bunny Max.
11131100	11133100	Because I'm gonna...
11133100	11134100	Nevermind.
11136100	11137100	Can I have some too?
11137100	11138100	No!
11138100	11139100	You can't!
11140100	11141100	Go away!
11146100	11148100	Please, please bring me her.
11148100	11149100	Please.
11149100	11151100	Oh, thank God!
11151100	11152100	Finally!
11156100	11160100	I guess the point is to lift the fantasy of having your life ruined by hostess club addiction.
11161100	11162100	Alright.
11163100	11164100	One voice.
11165100	11166100	One voice.
11166100	11168100	One voice to you, governor.
11170100	11172100	Oh, I saw some applesauce left.
11172100	11173100	I didn't even notice.
11177100	11178100	Blue.
11179100	11180100	Sporty tomboy.
11181100	11182100	Mommy vibe.
11182100	11183100	Smoker voice.
11183100	11185100	Sexiest possible voice.
11185100	11186100	She's very coup d'etre.
11186100	11187100	Really?
11188100	11189100	Nerdy voice.
11189100	11190100	Mommy.
11191100	11192100	Theater attitude is like first.
11192100	11193100	Okay.
11193100	11194100	We'll chat a little bit.
11194100	11195100	I'm gonna give her a present.
11196100	11197100	Actually, no.
11197100	11198100	I'm not gonna give her a turn just yet.
11198100	11199100	I'll give her...
11199100	11201100	I might extend my time with her.
11202100	11203100	Because I've talked to them the most.
11203100	11204100	They're two girls.
11205100	11206100	Wanna get some food?
11207100	11208100	Um...
11210100	11212100	Let's get some whatever the fuck this is.
11215100	11216100	I love this.
11216100	11217100	This is really delicious.
11218100	11220100	I'm feeling all sorts of happiness.
11221100	11222100	Oh, hello.
11222100	11223100	Nice to meet you.
11224100	11226100	Would you like to introduce yourself?
11227100	11228100	Oh, yeah.
11228100	11230100	You may call me Hito Kanda.
11231100	11232100	Oh.
11233100	11235100	You don't have to be polite with me.
11237100	11238100	I see.
11238100	11239100	I mean, okay.
11239100	11240100	I'm Hito Kanda.
11240100	11242100	I help my friend for work.
11243100	11244100	I didn't ask that.
11245100	11247100	You help your friends?
11247100	11248100	Like...
11248100	11249100	with a hand job?
11250100	11251100	Huh?
11251100	11252100	Yeah.
11253100	11255100	I was working at a company up until recently,
11255100	11257100	but I messed up.
11257100	11258100	It got fired.
11259100	11260100	Fired?
11261100	11262100	Right.
11263100	11266100	Are you bad at holding conversation?
11268100	11270100	Are you a person of a few words?
11271100	11274100	I guess I don't speak much.
11276100	11277100	Um...
11277100	11278100	Hito.
11279100	11280100	Why do you sound like a fucking robot?
11280100	11281100	Yeah?
11282100	11283100	I'm...
11283100	11285100	Oh, I just spilled apple sauce on my shirt.
11288100	11289100	Ah!
11289100	11290100	I was choked on it.
11291100	11292100	Ow, I just hit my head on my mic.
11293100	11294100	I'm falling apart.
11296100	11297100	I'm sorry.
11299100	11301100	You're kind of a loser.
11307100	11309100	That guy is a charmer.
11314100	11315100	What does that mean?
11316100	11318100	I'm sorry I'm like this.
11318100	11320100	Maybe you won't be able to have a good time.
11321100	11322100	It's okay.
11322100	11323100	Who knows what will happen?
11324100	11325100	You can suck my dick.
11326100	11328100	I can suck your toes.
11329100	11330100	You can suck my dick.
11331100	11332100	Just met each other.
11333100	11334100	You can suck my dick.
11335100	11337100	I think it would be nice if you could suck my dick.
11337100	11339100	Just take things slow, you know?
11339100	11340100	First base.
11341100	11342100	Suck in my dick.
11343100	11344100	No rush.
11344100	11346100	You already started to get to know each other.
11348100	11350100	Oh, thank you.
11351100	11352100	You're kind one, Haido.
11353100	11355100	Do you want some alcohol?
11356100	11357100	What should I do?
11357100	11359100	Is there anything I should prepare?
11360100	11361100	Yeah!
11362100	11364100	My efforts have been rewarded.
11365100	11367100	I want to drink something delicious.
11369100	11370100	What drink did you want?
11371100	11373100	I'm giving her like several different voices.
11373100	11374100	I'm so sorry.
11374100	11375100	I'm buying you...
11376100	11377100	I don't have enough money.
11380100	11381100	Okay, what drink do I want?
11381100	11382100	So I will have...
11383100	11384100	I'll just have a beer.
11385100	11386100	Where's the beer?
11386100	11387100	Where the fuck is the beer?
11387100	11388100	I'll just have a beer.
11388100	11390100	I don't know why we have it in these glasses, but...
11392100	11393100	Can I have a drink with you?
11394100	11397100	Yes, my beautiful princess.
11397100	11399100	I'm going to get you a bunny punch.
11401100	11403100	Because I'm going to punch my dick into your womb
11403100	11404100	and fill you with children.
11406100	11408100	I like that.
11408100	11409100	All right.
11413100	11414100	What?
11414100	11415100	That's it?
11415100	11416100	I expected more.
11419100	11420100	The deep Riz.
11421100	11422100	S2 Riz.
11422100	11423100	Thank you.
11424100	11425100	Okay, I have a present for you.
11429100	11432100	If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?
11433100	11434100	I hope you like it.
11435100	11436100	It smells like my mom.
11439100	11440100	What?
11440100	11441100	Don't worry about it.
11444100	11445100	Okay, thanks.
11447100	11448100	We have to take care of it.
11449100	11450100	Take care of what?
11451100	11452100	Your dick.
11452100	11453100	Huh?
11454100	11455100	What?
11458100	11460100	I keep doing double takes to see if this is a title.
11460100	11462100	Like I can't get a title.
11462100	11464100	Like my role.
11465100	11470100	Why are they just staring at each other and quiet?
11470100	11472100	Oh my God.
11474100	11476100	Wait, wait, you buy a drink for the bartenders?
11476100	11478100	Yes, yes, you do.
11480100	11483100	This is going to stream today.
11485100	11487100	Is there anything you want to talk about?
11488100	11493100	Yeah, you think tomorrow will be sunny or whatever?
11496100	11498100	There's a monsoon raging outside.
11501100	11502100	I have no idea.
11503100	11504100	I have no idea.
11505100	11506100	I have no idea.
11507100	11508100	I have no idea.
11509100	11510100	Sorry.
11513100	11516100	Buy a drink for the bartender to take a small sip and throw it into the plants.
11516100	11517100	Hell yeah.
11517100	11519100	But like how do they pace themselves?
11519100	11523100	You have to have like quite, like you have to be able to handle your liquor if you're
11523100	11529100	serving patrons for, let's say like, let's say your shift is like five hours and
11529100	11531100	maybe you hang out with a guy for each hour.
11531100	11533100	Like how many of you buying you more drinks?
11533100	11534100	Is this happening?
11534100	11536100	Like I need to know the schematics.
11541100	11543100	Do they really only take one sip?
11545100	11546100	I don't know.
11546100	11549100	No, like legit, like tell me the tea.
11550100	11551100	Is the tea piping hot?
11551100	11552100	Cause spill it.
11554100	11555100	You don't drink with every patron?
11555100	11556100	Okay.
11556100	11557100	Do they actually puke constantly?
11558100	11560100	This is the equivalent of the ghost anime top.
11561100	11562100	That fucking dump is hilarious.
11564100	11565100	It's basically their tipping.
11565100	11566100	They mix it for themselves.
11566100	11567100	They probably don't mix.
11567100	11569100	Oh, that's true.
11569100	11570100	Cause I had a friend.
11570100	11572100	Actually, I don't have a friend.
11572100	11573100	She does this currently.
11573100	11574100	Olive.
11574100	11578100	She bartends and she tells me sometimes customers try to buy her a drink and she just literally
11578100	11582100	gives herself like a sprite and says it's a gin and tonic.
11584100	11585100	Yeah, or they mix the drink of water.
11586100	11588100	Excuse me, hostess.
11588100	11589100	Will you bear my children?
11591100	11594100	Like there is a job somewhere in the world that you just get paid to drink.
11594100	11595100	That's basis.
11595100	11596100	That's kind of cool.
11596100	11597100	I'm like hostess job.
11597100	11598100	That's not bad.
11599100	11600100	Like does it pay well?
11601100	11606100	You know, shall we look up the weather forecast cause we're fucking nerds?
11607100	11609100	Are you always curious about the weather?
11611100	11615100	I just want to know how wet you're going to be tomorrow.
11615100	11616100	No, not really.
11616100	11617100	I'm just making small talk.
11620100	11621100	Oh, sorry.
11621100	11623100	I didn't mean anything by that.
11624100	11626100	This is who I am all the time.
11627100	11628100	Is that okay with you?
11629100	11631100	Can you please marry me?
11632100	11633100	It's all right with me.
11633100	11634100	So please marry me.
11634100	11635100	I'm on my knees.
11635100	11636100	Please.
11636100	11637100	I'm begging.
11637100	11640100	We're just starting to get into each other, but you're the one in my life.
11641100	11643100	You're a peculiar one.
11643100	11644100	Please.
11645100	11646100	You laughed just now, didn't you?
11646100	11647100	That means you should marry me.
11648100	11649100	I also know where you live.
11649100	11650100	I know where all the girls here live.
11652100	11653100	Okay.
11653100	11656100	You have a cute smile, especially when you're sleeping.
11657100	11658100	What?
11658100	11659100	Anyways.
11660100	11662100	Oh, uh, thanks.
11663100	11664100	What will you do?
11664100	11665100	Are you still going to drink?
11666100	11667100	Should I prepare some more alcohol?
11668100	11669100	Yeah.
11670100	11671100	Thank you.
11671100	11672100	It means you'll still be with me.
11673100	11674100	What drink did you want?
11675100	11677100	Uh, can I get like absolutely black?
11677100	11678100	Oh, I can only have three drinks.
11678100	11679100	Okay.
11680100	11684100	Um, I'll have some wine for Chip.
11685100	11686100	We're hanging out.
11689100	11691100	Beer before liquor, never been sicker.
11691100	11692100	Liquor before beer.
11692100	11693100	You're in the clear.
11695100	11696100	Can I have a drink with you?
11696100	11697100	Of course you can.
11697100	11698100	Girlie pop.
11699100	11701100	Only the best for my queen.
11701100	11703100	Only the best for my queen.
11705100	11706100	I'm so happy.
11706100	11707100	I'll get the bottle.
11714100	11716100	Oh, I got enough cash.
11716100	11717100	Yeah, I got fucking enough cash.
11721100	11723100	You can buy the 50K you had bought all about ending.
11724100	11725100	Let's chat.
11728100	11729100	Are you having fun?
11730100	11732100	She looks so fucking pissed off right now.
11733100	11734100	Yeah.
11734100	11735100	Why are you looking at me like that?
11735100	11737100	No, I think I'm enjoying myself.
11737100	11738100	Please stop looking at me like that.
11739100	11740100	Good.
11740100	11741100	Well, that's nice.
11742100	11745100	Miuka Chen, are you enjoying yourself?
11746100	11747100	Still undecided.
11748100	11749100	You kind of smell bad.
11750100	11752100	I would rather be hanging out with the people over there.
11753100	11757100	They actually buy me the 50KN bottle.
11758100	11759100	But it's whatever.
11761100	11763100	I don't exactly hate it.
11768100	11769100	Why don't you hate it?
11772100	11773100	Is that it?
11773100	11774100	I don't even know why I asked that.
11775100	11777100	She's looking at us like we're garbage.
11777100	11780100	You kind of gross me out and you kind of disgust me.
11782100	11784100	I would rather not hang out with trash like you,
11785100	11787100	but I need to pay the bills.
11788100	11789100	So here I am.
11792100	11793100	I don't know.
11793100	11794100	I wonder why.
11795100	11797100	Um, huh?
11798100	11799100	I don't believe you.
11800100	11801100	I know.
11801100	11802100	Are you really enjoying it?
11802100	11804100	Why are these girls gaslighting me?
11805100	11808100	They literally like, I'm fine and they're like, you're not okay.
11809100	11810100	Tell me what's wrong.
11811100	11812100	Give me your money.
11813100	11814100	And buy me a drink.
11815100	11816100	And I'll pretend to cheer you up.
11816100	11822100	So when you come here, you think you're getting serotonin and dopamine from only me.
11822100	11826100	So then you have to come and you have to spend more money to feel like you're okay.
11826100	11829100	Because you need me to tell you when you're okay or not.
11829100	11830100	This is toxic as hell.
11835100	11838100	This is a scyop.
11839100	11840100	This is a fucking scyop.
11843100	11845100	Just, I don't know how, but it is.
11850100	11851100	It's okay.
11852100	11853100	You don't have to worry about me.
11855100	11856100	I worry though.
11856100	11857100	You're my customer.
11858100	11859100	You must have a good time.
11860100	11862100	You must have a good time.
11863100	11864100	Okay.
11864100	11865100	Is she an android?
11867100	11868100	I don't know, man.
11868100	11869100	Okay.
11870100	11873100	Well, everyone enjoys themselves in their own way.
11875100	11877100	I'm not enjoying this.
11877100	11879100	I wish I was doing something else.
11879100	11881100	You're so odd.
11881100	11882100	Did you know that?
11884100	11885100	Yeah, I know.
11887100	11888100	It's whatever.
11889100	11891100	I don't exactly hate it.
11891100	11892100	I hate you.
11893100	11895100	You're not worth my time.
11897100	11898100	Oh, it's getting late.
11898100	11899100	I should go home soon.
11900100	11901100	Yeah, you should.
11903100	11904100	Shit, that's a lot of money.
11906100	11907100	See you.
11907100	11908100	I'll be waiting.
11909100	11910100	I just wanted to step on me.
11911100	11912100	Yeah, thanks for everything.
11912100	11913100	See you soon.
11917100	11918100	Statement.
11918100	11919100	It did good times.
11920100	11922100	We had a good conversation.
11922100	11924100	I'm looking forward to going to work now.
11926100	11928100	I don't want to go back there again.
11929100	11931100	Where's your money gone?
11932100	11933100	All right.
11933100	11934100	Pay me.
11935100	11936100	Fuck you.
11936100	11937100	Pay me.
11937100	11938100	What?
11938100	11939100	I thought I was going to get more money.
11939100	11940100	Okay.
11940100	11941100	Gamble time.
11944100	11948100	Actually, I should have bought more gifts
11948100	11949100	before I did this.
11955100	11956100	Fuck it.
11959100	11960100	We're going to win big.
11961100	11962100	We're going to win big.
11969100	11970100	We're going again.

11997100	11998100	Oh fuck.
11998100	11999100	When he wins.
12002100	12003100	Another one.
12004100	12006100	That was a small fish.
12006100	12007100	Small fish gamble.
12007100	12009100	We're going to win big.
12011100	12013100	Nah, we didn't win that much.
12018100	12019100	Hello, hello.
12019100	12020100	Welcome back.
12025100	12027100	Fuck your mother one more time.

12049100	12051100	It feels like playing gotcha indeed.

12168100	12169100	The girls are worried.
12169100	12170100	Don't worry about it.

12199100	12200100	Key type.
12205100	12206100	We might be back.
12206100	12207100	We're not quite.

12210100	12211100	She be mistress.
12211100	12212100	Lovely.
12212100	12213100	I'm begging you.
12213100	12214100	Don't lose the house.
12215100	12216100	Don't worry.
12216100	12218100	The house where the house is still okay.
12220100	12222100	We had to sell one of our children,
12222100	12223100	but it's fine.
12225100	12227100	Very some sweet nice people
12227100	12229100	are taking care of her now.
12233100	12234100	All right, we lost the house.
12238100	12239100	You know what that means.
12239100	12240100	We got it.
12240100	12241100	We got it.
12242100	12243100	We got it, you know.
12247100	12248100	It's not over.
12248100	12250100	It's not over till I say it's over.
12250100	12251100	All right.
12251100	12252100	All right.
12254100	12256100	It's not over till I say it's over.
12264100	12265100	I didn't perform that well
12265100	12267100	because I just was gambling my money away.
12267100	12268100	All right.
12268100	12269100	Let's go see the bitches.
12273100	12275100	I sold Ernesto the fuck.
12278100	12279100	Only lose when you stop.
12279100	12280100	Exactly.
12280100	12281100	Hello, hello.
12281100	12282100	Welcome in.
12284100	12286100	When you start selling up parent members.
12288100	12290100	That was the first things I sold.
12290100	12291100	Sorry guys.
12291100	12292100	Sorry.
12295100	12297100	Your hair is clipping through your hair.
12297100	12298100	What is that?
12298100	12299100	Whoa.
12299100	12300100	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
12300100	12301100	Whoa.
12302100	12303100	Sorry, I was looking.
12303100	12304100	I had a that's a raven moment.
12304100	12306100	I was looking into the future at her dialogue
12306100	12307100	and into the past.
12307100	12308100	You mean a memory?
12308100	12309100	Don't worry about it.
12310100	12312100	Oh, you came on my tits again.
12312100	12314100	I tell you not to just walk in
12314100	12315100	and you just shoot on me.
12315100	12316100	I don't.
12316100	12317100	What drink did you want?
12319100	12322100	Oh, you know what?
12326100	12330100	Can I have some too?
12330100	12331100	No.
12331100	12332100	You can't.
12333100	12334100	You can't.
12334100	12335100	No.
12335100	12336100	Get away from me.
12338100	12339100	A customer called me.
12339100	12340100	Yeah.
12340100	12341100	Yeah.
12341100	12342100	Yeah.
12342100	12343100	Give me the blue girl.
12344100	12345100	Give me the blue girl.
12345100	12346100	Fuck whatever.
12346100	12347100	You're good enough.
12348100	12349100	How's it going?
12351100	12353100	What do you do on your days off?
12353100	12354100	Hi, Chan.
12354100	12357100	Oh, are you asking me on a T?
12357100	12359100	You're pretty aggressive, huh?
12359100	12360100	Hi, Chan.
12360100	12362100	Even though you turned down my threesome.
12362100	12363100	What?
12363100	12365100	I thought you were past this.
12366100	12368100	I broke time to get the cardboard box.
12368100	12369100	It happened to me deficit and funny.
12369100	12371100	I feel like the game just ends.
12372100	12373100	That's not what I meant.
12373100	12375100	I really am interested.
12375100	12376100	Oh, really?
12376100	12378100	That's no fun.
12378100	12379100	Don't you think I'm charming?
12379100	12380100	No.
12380100	12382100	I mean, of course I do.
12382100	12391100	I wouldn't come and come and come and come and get really nice online pictures.
12392100	12394100	I really like your Facebook page.
12395100	12397100	I wouldn't come and see you if I didn't.
12398100	12400100	It's funny that you think that.
12401100	12403100	It doesn't even hurt my pictures.
12403100	12407100	It's so funny that it's actually a little embarrassing.
12408100	12410100	Thanks.
12410100	12411100	Thanks, though.
12411100	12413100	Those pictures are so embarrassing.
12413100	12419100	Sometimes what freaks me out is the dialogue that I'm dubbing and making up makes sense for their responses.
12419100	12421100	She's like, it's so embarrassing.
12421100	12427100	Like, as if she was an actual fucking line.
12429100	12431100	It's so funny.
12432100	12436100	Thanks, though.
12436100	12439100	Did you like the bikini ones?
12439100	12442100	I mean, anyway, you want us to know about my days off?
12442100	12443100	Let's spin this around.
12443100	12445100	What do you think I do?
12446100	12448100	I feel like you go out shopping.
12448100	12450100	Go out shopping for clothes.
12450100	12451100	Sorry.
12451100	12453100	Go out shopping for clothes and stuff.
12453100	12454100	Too bad.
12454100	12456100	I'd like to shop, but I have no money.
12457100	12458100	Wow.
12458100	12460100	She's me for real for real.
12460100	12463100	So that's why I whore myself out in this bunny garden.
12463100	12467100	Please, can you please take the offer for the threesome?
12467100	12469100	I'm giving you a discount.
12469100	12472100	It's only $150.
12473100	12475100	Most of the time, it's $300.
12475100	12477100	You get two for the price of one.
12477100	12478100	Okay?
12478100	12480100	I'm not interested.
12480100	12482100	Whatever.
12482100	12483100	I went to a shop.
12483100	12486100	I wait until I find something I really want.
12486100	12488100	Then I buy it.
12488100	12490100	Buy home money.
12493100	12495100	She's planning something.
12495100	12498100	I went to karaoke in front of the station by myself last weekend.
12498100	12501100	I sang nothing but the songs I wanted to sing myself.
12501100	12503100	Doesn't everybody fucking do that?
12505100	12509100	I guess you try to pick songs that everyone knows when you go with friends.
12512100	12514100	Oh, that Tito's came back up.
12514100	12515100	Oh.
12515100	12518100	Then I mention it as a reflux when I have vodka.
12520100	12521100	Yeah.
12521100	12522100	I like hearing people sing.
12522100	12524100	So going with friends is fun too.
12524100	12526100	Mostly I just go by myself.
12526100	12528100	Because my friends are in my head.
12528100	12530100	They're talpas.
12531100	12533100	Shut up, Jeff.
12533100	12536100	Last weekend, I wanted to sing a blow-off scene.
12537100	12539100	What did you do last weekend, Hai Chen?
12539100	12541100	Or are you making out with girls maybe?
12541100	12542100	Whoa!
12542100	12545100	Slow your fucking roll, medium but premium.
12545100	12546100	Okay?
12546100	12548100	I was gambling.
12548100	12550100	Daddy gotta make that money.
12551100	12552100	Obviously not.
12552100	12555100	I don't even know anyone who'd want to.
12555100	12557100	I'm a fucking loser.
12558100	12559100	Oh yeah.
12559100	12561100	I guess you need two willing participants for that.
12561100	12563100	Like me and one of the other girls.
12563100	12565100	Four or three some.
12565100	12568100	All you have to do is pay me $150.
12569100	12571100	Well then, why don't I act as your partner?
12571100	12573100	Are you gonna make out with me?
12574100	12575100	What?
12575100	12576100	Here.
12576100	12577100	I'll blow you a kiss.
12581100	12583100	That's all for now.
12583100	12585100	So hang in there, okay?
12586100	12587100	Wait, wait, wait.
12587100	12588100	She's zipper.
12591100	12593100	Hey, Chloe, can you get a rag?
12593100	12595100	Yeah, this one just popped.
12595100	12596100	Yeah, thank you.
12596100	12597100	Thank you.
12598100	12599100	Hai Chen, how about drinks?
12599100	12600100	Do you want a bit more?
12600100	12602100	Should I get you something?
12605100	12607100	No, I don't have any money.
12610100	12611100	Cheers to my pants.
12611100	12613100	Cheers in my pants.
12613100	12615100	I don't relax.
12617100	12619100	I'm sitting at the checkout line.
12624100	12626100	Wow, is it already this late?
12626100	12628100	I'll head back home.
12631100	12633100	Please come again.
12633100	12634100	I'll be waiting.
12634100	12636100	Yeah, thank you for today.
12641100	12643100	I'm gonna gamble.
12646100	12648100	I should have saved.
12656100	12658100	Yeah.
12658100	12661100	Okay, I'm gonna save and then I'm gonna keep gambling
12661100	12664100	because I want to see, like, because I feel like
12664100	12666100	it's gonna be very forgiving
12668100	12671100	when you try to gamble with a low amount.
12673100	12675100	Open the window and a breeze rolls in.
12675100	12678100	Cheers in my pants.
12679100	12680100	It's barely enough for the bill.
12680100	12681100	I was fine.
12683100	12685100	See, it doesn't do that much.
12686100	12688100	300 yen is about, like, fucking five bucks.
12690100	12693100	And I win, like, 50K yen because I'd be sick.
12698100	12700100	That works for me.
12702100	12705100	I want me to buy one of the girls.
12708100	12711100	I'll use all my money to buy them a fucking toy.
12712100	12715100	Oh, wait, I realized that I could have gotten, like, a make-up set.
12715100	12717100	It's fine.
12717100	12719100	Then we're gonna save.
12724100	12726100	And then we're gonna gamble.
12731100	12733100	I gotta make the money for the girlies.
12733100	12735100	I need to treat them, you know?
12736100	12738100	You know, it's called gamble heaven.
12742100	12745100	Let's fucking go. Let's keep going. Let's keep going. Let's keep going.
12746100	12748100	What are macaroons? They're really tasty.
12748100	12750100	I really don't know how to explain it, like, it's like a type of...
12750100	12752100	Is it a pastry? I don't know.
12752100	12754100	They're really tasty, though.
12754100	12756100	I like macaroons.
12756100	12757100	Oh, yeah!
12757100	12760100	Again, hit me, hit me, hit me.
12762100	12764100	Dealer, hit me, hit.

12770100	12772100	Oh, fuck.
12780100	12783100	You guys can't see, but I'm doing the orange justice dance to the music.
12786100	12789100	All right, let's gamble.
12792100	12794100	Wait, they'll still let me gamble when I have no money?
12796100	12798100	How does that work?
12799100	12801100	All right, sorry, I sold one of you guys.
12803100	12805100	Oh, we're fine! See, we're fine.
12810100	12812100	I don't know how that works, but, you know...
12813100	12815100	Now's my time to rest up and recover.
12816100	12818100	This is the only place I can heal my mind.
12820100	12822100	I need my dick sucked.
12824100	12826100	Good morning!
12826100	12827100	Whoa, bitch!
12827100	12829100	Oh, you came. Thanks.
12830100	12832100	What drink did you want?
12832100	12834100	Uh, I'll just have a custard.
12835100	12837100	Can I have some, too?
12837100	12838100	No.
12838100	12840100	Give me Blue Girl.
12840100	12842100	I like how she looks like she's gonna cry every time I say no.
12842100	12844100	Okay, perfect. Blue Girl's coming.
12844100	12846100	Oh, they have cute little bunny things.
12846100	12848100	I like how she moonwalks in place.
12849100	12852100	Hey, I already forgot your name, but I started with an M.
12852100	12854100	Um, I got you.
12854100	12856100	Bunny.
12856100	12858100	If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?
12858100	12860100	I hope you like it.
12860100	12864100	It's, like, just the perfect size for humping.
12866100	12868100	Looks at you.
12868100	12870100	Really? Oh, thanks.
12870100	12872100	I've never really tried that before.
12872100	12874100	I was just plain happy.
12876100	12877100	What?
12878100	12881100	Hmm, should I hump the bunny?
12881100	12883100	Hmm.
12883100	12886100	Uh, sure, what's up?
12886100	12888100	You got fired.
12888100	12890100	No fucking shit!
12890100	12892100	I didn't mean to remind you.
12895100	12897100	Yeah, I did.
12897100	12899100	You're not gonna let that go, huh?
12900100	12902100	I'm sorry. What was your name again?
12904100	12907100	I'm actually hurt. I shouldn't have given you that fucking bunny.
12911100	12913100	She is so cold, but I love her.
12915100	12917100	She's better than the other two girls.
12918100	12920100	I know, Kanda.
12920100	12922100	I know, right. I know.
12922100	12925100	I know, right. I know.
12925100	12927100	So you are an android.
12927100	12929100	You're back again.
12929100	12932100	Take a girl out to dinner first, won't you?
12932100	12935100	Thank you.
12935100	12937100	Gambling fund.
12937100	12939100	Gambling fund?
12940100	12942100	Thank you, Eternity.
12944100	12947100	I came to see you, Mewkuchen.
12948100	12950100	Ew, gross.
12950100	12952100	Please leave.
12952100	12955100	Is there another customer that needs to work with me, Debra? No?
12955100	12957100	None of my regulars are here?
12957100	12958100	Oh, fine.
12958100	12960100	Oh, hi-dote.
12960100	12962100	You're a strange one.
12962100	12965100	You must be low on money, though.
12966100	12968100	Oh, I...
12968100	12970100	Damn.
12970100	12972100	Jesus fuck.
12973100	12975100	She is tearing me apart.
12977100	12980100	I'm helping out my friend now, so it's okay.
12980100	12982100	You don't have to worry about that.
12982100	12984100	I'm not worried.
12984100	12986100	Honestly, I don't care.
12986100	12988100	Oh, okay.
12988100	12993100	She's just so unbothered.
12993100	12998100	She only works this job just to insult her patrons.
12998100	13000100	She makes plenty of money.
13000100	13002100	She's like a trust fund baby.
13002100	13005100	She just comes here because she has a sick, twisted pleasure
13005100	13009100	of just acting disinterested and insulting her clients.
13009100	13011100	She's just so unbothered.
13011100	13014100	She only works this job just to insult her patrons.
13014100	13016100	She makes plenty of money.
13017100	13020100	You must spend your money wisely.
13020100	13023100	Do you know that I was gambling?
13023100	13025100	It's necessary.
13025100	13028100	Does she fucking know?
13028100	13029100	She must fucking know.
13029100	13030100	They must know.
13030100	13033100	The bots must know that when you hit a certain like below
13033100	13035100	and you're in a hole, they probably are like,
13035100	13038100	hey, man, stop gambling.
13038100	13042100	Yeah, I'll make sure to do that.
13042100	13048100	Sorry, I burped in my mouth.
13048100	13049100	Gross.
13049100	13053100	But thanks for coming here to spend that important money with me.
13053100	13055100	Because I deserve it and you don't.
13055100	13057100	Hand it over.
13057100	13061100	It feels strange to say you're welcome after that.
13061100	13068100	I keep getting acid reflux from the alcohol.
13068100	13070100	Ha, ha.
13070100	13072100	That was a really fake laugh.
13072100	13074100	It wasn't.
13074100	13075100	This is my fake laugh.
13075100	13076100	Ha, ha.
13076100	13079100	That was the same noise.
13079100	13080100	No, it wasn't.
13080100	13081100	You're different.
13081100	13083100	Listen closely.
13083100	13086100	You smiled for me again.
13086100	13089100	Look at her fucking straight ass face.
13089100	13091100	You smiled for me again.
13091100	13094100	Stairs.
13094100	13096100	Blinks looks at you.
13096100	13098100	Does she blink?
13098100	13101100	Okay, she just fluttered her pretty little lashes at me.
13101100	13104100	Yeah, what will you do?
13104100	13106100	Are you still going to drink?
13106100	13108100	Should I prepare some more alcohol?
13108100	13111100	Nah, I'm good.
13111100	13113100	Wow, it's already this late.
13113100	13116100	I'll head back home.
13116100	13119100	Okay, so when do I get to fuck them?
13119100	13120100	See ya.
