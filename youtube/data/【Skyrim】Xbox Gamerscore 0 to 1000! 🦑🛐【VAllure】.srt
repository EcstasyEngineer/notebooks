1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Testing, testing. Attention, please. Attention, attention. Hear you, hear you.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,040
Skyrim belongs to the North. That's my hear you, hear you. Why are you saying I

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,840
hate you? I'm not even freaking spawning yet! Let me spawn in! You know, I learned

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,000
something new yesterday thanks to TikTok so I can't wait to talk about it.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,320
Right, testing. This is Ambroker. See, this freaking, you freaking freaks. Oh my

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:47,320
god! Oh my god! I'm YouTube, I got accepted from YouTube monetization like

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,120
right now! No way! I just got accepted for YouTube monetization right freaking

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:01,760
now! No way! Wait, but I need to do my stream then! Wait! Oh my god! I literally

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:09,920
just opened up YouTube studio! I've been accepted! No way! Wait, do I need to go off

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:19,200
lane and do my... No, I'll do it tomorrow. Oh my god! We did it! What the frick? What's

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,080
the frick? Fractally tech? Tic-tac? Petty work? Oh my god! Wait, and hopefully this

12
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,360
doesn't say anything. Wow! Wow! I just freaking checked! Right, right. We're still

13
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,080
gonna do Skyrim today because you know, Skyrim belongs to the Norths. But what? Tomorrow I'll

14
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,760
get to do my monetization celebration stream! And my toes look amazing for it so I'm

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,320
excited! Oh my god! That's amazing! Right, if you're freaking watching right now,

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,440
don't worry. Like the how you call it. The memberships aren't like activated

17
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,240
because I need to like go in and tell it like what to call the tiers and stuff.

18
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:06,240
But I'm like 100% sure tier one is $1.99 USD. This is to prevent anyone

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,720
gaining access via gift to membership streams. And then I believe the the

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:22,760
membership price, like the actual price, is $4.99 USD. Does that sound right? I need to ask you guys!

21
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:31,080
I need to ask you guys what sounds right. You guys call the shots. Yeah, if it's $4.99

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,840
and then Patreon's $5 then it's $9.99 total to support your Oshii at Veiler.

23
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,720
You okay? That seems right. Okay, that sounds okay. Everyone's gonna give me the thumbs up.

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,320
Ahhhh!

25
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,680
Congrats on the monetization. Doesn't mean we won't support you in other ways anymore though.

26
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, thank you so much. I really miss you.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
WAH!

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Congrats. I'm happy for you.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Why are you giving me money for getting more money? What the fuck? It's an infinite money glitch.

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:11,800
Oh my god. Also, there was an offline donation by Shank. Shank says, thank you for the tip,

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,960
by the way, he says, I'm over here squiddin' my dick. I got ink on my dick right now.

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,920
Which is so good. Thank you, Tim Schottel. Congrats on the monetization. Thank you!

33
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,920
And Bajinga as well. Thank you again for the tip. For the 20. That was a big tip. Thank you.

34
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay. To prevent gifts, you need to set the membership quote above five bucks. Are you serious?

35
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wasn't it not membership can only be gifted?

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,760
Stop giving me!

37
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
He's confusing the couple things.

38
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,600
Then why are you giving me money for being able to make, oh my god, no! I have to end up

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,960
my ASMR series now. I have four ASMR videos. I owe you.

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,840
Oh, and I'm doing an endurance stream today. It's over. Reluctantly saying thank you for the tip.

41
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:11,000
Wait, I could have sworn you can only gift the lowest tier membership on YouTube,

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,120
or has that been updated since? I won't say who so they can announce it themselves,

43
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,560
but someone else has also gotten monetized. Oh my god, we're all done or monetized?

44
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,400
No way. Like, okay. So the only reason we didn't like get monetized faster in quotation marks

45
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,680
is because you, stop it! Don't give me money! Forget money!

46
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,680
Pre-ordering my search. Thank you. Don't stay down for the tip. That's crazy.

47
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,480
That's freaking crazy. Gifts go to the most expensive tier under five bucks.

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,280
So I need to set it as 501. That looks terrible though. That looks so greedy.

49
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,640
But I can't have any outsiders in the membership streams because

50
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,040
I need to use a lot of euphemisms. Are you squiddling right now?

51
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,680
Shank! Oh, it's off-link! I'm in front of the Blackwater. I'm all about stron of the bath.

52
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,960
Thanks, Shank, for the tip. You guys will get the Blackwater reference very shortly. Super training,

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,840
Virginia! Stop! Actually, one cent greed law. Actually, it's two cent greed because I wanted it

54
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,800
4.99. It's said it to... No, six dollars is too much. This is too much money to ask for,

55
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:36,280
like, for membership stuff. Oh, right, that's it. When I said we're making an agency together,

56
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,840
I wasn't kidding. Oh, I see. And our snowberries are here. They just did an ASMR stream. We all

57
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:50,520
have to keep our voices down, okay? The snowberries are asleep. Fine, you've got it. Set it to 999.

58
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,600
I would start at 60 bucks just to be sure. Post up, are you?

59
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,400
And hi, Icy Raiders. Hi, snowberries. I just unlocked monetization. I didn't know

60
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,320
until I freaking went on my channel. It just happened right now. I'm not going to do my monetization

61
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,680
celebration today. I'm going to do it tomorrow and then it gives me a less time to do endurance

62
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,720
skyrim unless we come back to maybe switch up the thingy. But that's okay. It's actually a perfect

63
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:29,400
transition from Icy's stream. Hi, hi, little icicles. But yes, we are all getting monetized very

64
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:36,920
slowly, which is fantastic. Oh my gosh, you can get support via email or chat. Don't worry,

65
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:44,920
that chat support thing does absolutely nothing. I assure you, it doesn't do a single thing, okay?

66
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,120
Actually, I tell a lie, they did help me one time, so I'll give it up.

67
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,160
Amy, thank you, Amy, for your clap, clap, clap. Apparently, there's one other person that has

68
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,040
been processed. When we applied, it was like, yeah, it takes a month for them to review your

69
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:07,480
chat. A month, a month to review James Cameron's avatar, excuse me. A month to freaking review

70
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:14,840
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, excuse me. Oh no, I never, oh, you guys so much ASMR video.

71
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,760
But I do have some good news about VTuber Collabs. I finally, I finally

72
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:32,360
sent away. So now I'm waiting on the girls. The ball is now in the girls court that I'm

73
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:43,480
collabing with. Yeah, yesterday, I was listening to a music creator called Yoast. He's a Dutch

74
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,880
and he was in Eurovision and he goes, Welcome to Europe. Life is till the

75
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:57,960
daughter, Europa, Europa. Turns out he has a song where it goes, Sakma.

76
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:09,560
So just imagine me playing the song and repeat in the dark, taping up four ASMR collabs in one go.

77
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:17,320
A month review time sounds realistic, given the fact that your streams are all above 10 hours.

78
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,800
Thank you for the tip again, but you're giving a lot of money. You need to be careful with the

79
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,880
crowd. Are you just reading me right now? You're in trouble too. No, thank you for the tip. Oh my

80
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:39,320
God. Damn, I almost got that song out of my head. Yeah, so basically just imagine me in a dark room,

81
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:48,360
just I had this song on repeat. I'm like, yeah, okay, right. Wolf mums, Pamper you to sleep,

82
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,240
right? Okay, what's next? Okay, jealous VTubers drag you in an alleyway for tangos. Okay,

83
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:01,080
what's next? What's next? Right, next script. Like I was on it. I was on it. Anonymous. It's

84
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,160
the silent and on his back. He's giving money, but he's not saying anything. He's not getting Brian

85
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,840
to say anything. Thank you for the tip. But yeah, anyway, that's how I work. I don't know how you

86
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,200
work, but I work like a madman. Had to take a shower. So I've got to listen at 1.5 speed for

87
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,640
the next 15 minutes. I was not prepared for the super speed beat up. So I was as strongly forgotten

88
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,920
to live tweet or tweet. If you mean tweet, I have absolutely horrific news. I am the worst VTuber

89
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,880
to ever spawn. I never use my emotes. I spent like so much on all these emotes. I never use them. I

90
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,880
never tweet out when I'm live because I start at the same time every single day and I'm like,

91
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:52,280
you want to be here, you're gonna be here. Somebody. Absolutely. Next script. YouTube to

92
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,320
monetize you one day after you get proved. I mean, depending on how the monetization celebration

93
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,360
goes tomorrow, that's quite plausible. But hey, at least a little bit YouTube history.

94
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,520
Don't mind if I make the headlines for VLR. So you guys go and support my gen mates. That's

95
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,120
right. There are five other lovely girls in the description below for you to check out. If you

96
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:22,120
cannot stand, Todd winning yet again with the death grip the Skyrim has over female VTubers.

97
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,240
Okay. So if you've had enough of that, Denny, you worry, I've got you sorted out. Sheepsters

98
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,920
is going live and team minus two hours. I believe Emma and Azura, my goodness, Azura,

99
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:41,560
and is coming for my Endurance Stream title. For goodness gravy, she was up on a farm. No,

100
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,800
it's not called Farmville. The farming star Jew Valley, for goodness sake. And then she

101
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,880
really popped out of 10 of her Endurance Stream. I'm like, damn, they're coming from my title.

102
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,200
But I'm gonna show them how it's done. Okay, I'm gonna show them how it's done. I woke up

103
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,360
feeling sick and I was like, oh, maybe I won't do an Endurance Stream. But the moment I hit go live,

104
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,280
it feels like I have been given a second burst of energy, a second wind, if you will. It's like

105
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:15,480
that cinematic moment in like the video game thing. We're like, oh, Brian.

106
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:31,960
Why would you give 100? That's so much. You never even said anything, Dapper Bucket. Oh my

107
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:41,400
God. Thank you for the 100. Iron Reaper 100. Why are you? Why are you giving me money for being

108
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:48,440
able to earn more money? What's going on? What's going on? Have I missed something in the VTuber

109
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,680
etiquette book? Iron Reaper, thank you for the 100. Dapper, thank you for the 100. Zarian,

110
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:02,120
congrats on monetization. Meeting great for anyone who goes over $20 on the donut. That's

111
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,560
terrible. You can't say that part out loud. Literally, everyone is giving your... Yeah,

112
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:16,520
please make sure you are fully sorted before you give any money. Please understand, I adore what I

113
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,400
do. I have been welcomed with open arms into the VTuber community as someone who could definitely

114
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,800
have been described as an outsider. And instead of being shunned, I was welcomed and taught the ropes,

115
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,960
which I'm so thankful for. But please understand, like, I get streamed for free. I love what I do,

116
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:44,840
okay? Anonymous with a 20 with no message again. Brian, you look, you need to put Brian to work,

117
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,720
okay? You need to put Brian to work. Oh, anonymous, give me 20 because I said the 20 thing.

118
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:03,160
That is terrible. But we've done it. We officially have finished our first week at Bueller Headquarters.

119
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,280
Literally, everyone has done fantastic streaming. I am very happy to see some of the girls taking

120
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,880
a break. Oh, Irvan Biscay. Brian. We don't like giving YouTube a cut.

121
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,920
Wait, oh, that's why you do stream elements. Okay, I understand. I read about that. Thank you,

122
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:29,160
Irvan Biscay. Brian! Don't know, we'll continue until morale improves. Congratulations. Wait,

123
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:36,280
why did I know that? Do you guys hear Brian at all when he talks? Yeah, you do, surely you do.

124
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,120
Oh, my God. Wait, you said I said your name yesterday correctly.

125
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,680
Rilke? Rilke? Cadmus? Thank you for the tip. Why did I know that quote? Yeah, we hear him. Okay, thank

126
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:56,840
God. God, it feels like so much longer. You've always been here. I think because, like, my average

127
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:03,000
streamed week is probably what a VTuber achieves in an entire month. So it feels like I've been

128
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,400
here for a very long time. I was like, nope, this is officially my first, like, strum, you know,

129
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,920
first second week of streaming. Ancient joke, the beatings will continue until the more... Okay,

130
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:26,760
that's... Okay, okay, okay. Guys, do you know a perfect way to party the achievement? A really

131
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,200
big storm of bad joke. What did you even say? Was that supposed to be a joke? I don't get it.

132
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,600
I don't get the joke if that was supposed to be a joke. So you're getting crickets.

133
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,640
Who's ready? Who's ready for bi-zura, bi-zura, bi-zura. Now, I know that's not in this game,

134
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,240
but bi-zura. Remember that time I accident... Wait, can you hear the game?

135
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,640
Can you hear any of that? You can't hear any of that.

136
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Oh, oh, oh, wait, get monetization off the screen right now.

137
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,600
Oh, my freaking mouse won't hover over... Right, there we go.

138
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,320
Oh, my voice is cracking already. I've known you started...

139
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:26,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Don't again, don't again. Don't again, No Skyrim.

140
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,760

141
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,600

146
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,360
All right, I've turned it down a wee bit and turn me up

147
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,340
There's a Brian echo now

148
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,440
Right, I guess I'll just play him through desktop only. I'll just need to test if this works

149
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,120
Okay, okay, it works. It works. Okay. Let's jump into it. Do you know the actual lyrics?

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,640
I say dovahkin dovahkin dovahkin of Skyrim

152
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
My god

153
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,240
No mods of course right no vanilla, I'm appreciating the game and its release quality

154
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,760
I do understand those who prefer a modded experience. I like to appreciate a game the way it has been released

155
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
I understand there's always time constraints

156
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,440
There's always stuff that has been taken out for example ruining the thieves guild

157
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,760
and

158
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,880
But I just I want to appreciate it how it is

159
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,880
Wait, I didn't hear any of that if that played

197
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,040
Identifying yourself as a fallout wanderer

198
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:14,440
Apparently we can do fallout 76 multiplayer. I don't know how it's gonna work too much monetization get absolutely loved on nerd

199
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
How dare you?

200
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:23,200
Merida is the god who owns the beacon. Ah, right. We're ERPing now as a Skyrim

201
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Day deities

202
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,720
Johnny, please make the stop that's funny as anything

203
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,600
Okay, are we right we're gonna be role-playing out the wazoo

204
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
Nord what is the bill today?

205
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,040
a

206
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,520
Grembo, thank you for the congrats and the tip. We are Nord filled. Okay, we are Nord

207
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,800
We are Stormcloak. We are enjoying the game as the

208
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,920
Resistance or the opposition to what the Legion is trying to put on the upon Skyrim as a whole

209
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,640
Okay, so Skyrim is the current region that we're in

210
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,160
There's different regions such as Hammerfell for example

211
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,920
Oh

212
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,200
Brian you rather go to the woods with a high elf or a grizzly bear

213
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,120
I

214
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,000
Don't know could I take on a high elf? I feel like I'm really weak

215
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:29,840
Apparently polar bears are actually the most aggressive breed of bear if you didn't know that grizzly bears actually avoid human intervention apparently right?

216
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
So we are Nordic

217
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,120
Seasons of Skyrim they are tall and fair haired people strong and hardy

218
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,960
Nord's are famous for their resistance to cold and their talent as warriors

219
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,440
They can use a battle cry to make opponents flee

220
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,920
Fantastic. Um, are we gonna be a man or a woman? Oh?

221
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
um

222
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Oh

223
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,560
Okay, okay, just a few technicals. It's a technical difficulty

224
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Do you get to the cloud district very often? Oh?

225
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,520
What am I saying? Of course you don't thank you Nazim. Are you roleplayed as NPCs of Skyrim?

226
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,200
Nazim, I'm not really I don't know if you can hear that but that's me click and select on Nord

227
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,440
Oh, it's it's trigger. Is this where the membership pre-orders happen stop?

228
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,480
Rico, thank you for the tip. Why are you? I don't understand another week of my new daily routine

229
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,080
From five to one and then stroney time from two to two followed by sleep from two fifteen

230
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
No, that's so unhealthy

231
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,640
Barrel is so unhealthy. Oh my god. Shut up and take my money

232
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880

No breaks on this alluring train. Oh my god. You guys are in it. You're in it to win it

236
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,840
No, did I get to play a whammin? I get to be a whammin or do you guys not like when whammin?

237
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,440
I don't know. I feel like if we're seared at someone's booty all day, I'd rather pick a whammin, you know

238
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,400
But thank you so much for all these tips Phoenix bearer Nazim. Yeah. Yeah, Nazim

239
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,480

240
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,040
What's the matter? Someone steal your sweet role?

241
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Oh my

242
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,080
Someone stole your sweet role. I used to be able to do the accent in Skyrim, but then I'm completely bloody forgotten how to do it

243
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,080
I'll need to listen to it a bit more. Um

244
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,980
Right, we're gonna be young and pretty and

245
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,000
So we'll use that face

246
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:55,400
We're gonna be white as possible because you'll never guess what color I am and the reason why you don't do skinny is because

247
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,360
As skinny as possible is because the clothes

248
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Texture on the shoulders. Can you see that you actually are better if you want less clothes?

249
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,520
Mashing to put the weight up just a wee tiny wee bit and for the complexion again

250
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,440
We're wanting young and the door do we want freckles?

251
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,400
I don't know freckles mainstream. Fuck it. We'll get no dirt. Do you want a kill scar?

252
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,560
And the name of the nodes I pray to the Lord's you all get a taste of my blade and my sword and I'm taking on hordes of enemies

253
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,600
I'm going on hordes of weaponry's

254
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,400
I think I think cheeky little scars on the face there just to kind of show that we mean business, okay?

255
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,760
Where is here? I don't really I'm not really fussed for all this stuff

256
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,360
Nick color. I didn't even know that was a cent

257
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,680

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,480
That's I'm looking into your soul eyes. I used to be an adventure

266
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,960
Then I took an arrow to the knee. Thank you. I love how this entire phrase is a euphemism for marriage tying you down from your

267
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,220
Oh, wait, oh not the old ball and chain ruining my Skyrim adventures

268
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,680
Sorry, I thank you for the tip. Literally the old ball and chain

269
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,440
Do I want to like I want piercing eyes to be like yeah, I'm a Nord by the way

270
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,480
That's realistically piercing. Yeah, I'll do it. I'll do it

271
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,760
We just need to change the hair because I didn't like the hair. Let's see what we'll go

272
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,520
Look to the look to the second one. This is girl simulator D. Right. No, we're gonna have hair on you

273
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,200
There's no point in having me here. Is there bunches like me? I don't think there's any bunches. I

274
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,560
Feel like an adventure doesn't have time to like perfectly pleat her hair. Oh, look at that nose bridge

275
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,360
She got a nose job. It's so pretty

276
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,840
I don't oh, I'm not we're not doing the Mohawk. I can tell you that much right now. There's really no bunches. I

277
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,800
Know this game came out in 2011, but bunches knee bunches

278
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,120
a

279
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,800
Girl knows damn bills wrap. Yes, vanilla Skyrim

280
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,480
Stopstream no bunches need to get some mods going honestly

281
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,560
Right. Oh, that's ridiculous. Oh

282
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,840
That looks kind of cool. That's badass, but what floor are we gonna be blonde Nordic or we're gonna be black hair Nordic?

283
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,680
Ah

Don't know if we're going like blonde like perfect waifu type thing

00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,960
Okay, done. How'd I do done? What's her name?

291

298
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,920
Just put it in the chat. Okay. Just put it in the chat

299
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,200
I don't understand why you're giving me money for the ability to make money

300
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,840

305
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,840
Daughters, but just remember the only reason that we have five daughters in the first place is because of what happened in the age

306
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,760
Smart booth all lights were turned off. So we'll need to just

307
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,920
If you want that again, right, we're gonna just call ourselves dragonborn. I like role-playing directly

351
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,920
We kept going back and forth at the same area, but like I handed it to him

352
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,160
I'm like dad when you do this bit and he's like, I don't know what you're doing either

353
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,200
Okay, you need to hide behind here to not be hit by the dragons glass

354
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,600

Actually, I forgot to get back to her about permission for something which you guys will really enjoy. I don't know

362
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,840
Um, I don't know if she's still lurking right heart. Wait. Hold on

363

My god, oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. It's drama. It's

366
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,040
We're going with the storm folk which is blue because the red are the baddies

367
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
I

368
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,560
Actually can't wait strong. He really said chat this real when making it

369
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,320
Right, can you unbound me yet so I can start fixing my controls. Oh my god, he's not got a pulse

370
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,960
Yeah, he's what is known as a ragdoll

371
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,320
Looks like we're the only ones who made it

372
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Yeah, we don't like people who aren't

373
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,240
No, if you actually know the lore of Skyrim, it's actually pretty outrageous

374
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,840
I don't know why the storm cooks are the baddies. I'm not I'm not going mental

375
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
but from what I know

376
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:01,040
The Thalmor not the Thalmor the age the thumb. Oh, no the Thalmor embassy. Is it the Thalmor?

377
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,840
They came into Skyrim and we're like, right?

378
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,120
Right. Sorry. Sorry. I'm trying to explain the lore of Skyrim like really quick. Right. Hold on

379
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,240
Let's fix my frickin right. That should be run

380
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,680
Sentence gameplay run

381
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,840

382
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Just what?

388
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,520
What one should crutch be I can only know I only know which one crutch should be okay

389
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,880
Crutch should be the other analog stick. I need to go back out in order to do it properly

393
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
You need to think of your monetization stream

She be already put what hers is I think I said what mine was in chat if you don't know what to do

Mmm, right one more to get right everything

410
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:40,680
Oh, oh, let's get that off. Let's check out the drip. Oh, look at the storm cold drip

411
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,040
To your one should be a motess in the rest can have been practice

412
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,160
Can you check your difficulty? I think it's all bug. No, no, nothing wrong with the difficulty of the game

413
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,160
Wait, what do we need to oh wait? There's about to be an enemy that comes through a thing or something

414
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:02,240
We're about to jump on hope by tomorrow six at six. I would love that for all the girls. They're so excited

415
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,520
They can't see us they don't know

416
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,240
He can't see me at all is he like directly at me by the way. Oh

417
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,200
My god, I forgot how clunky the fricking if you're late

418
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,280
Oh my god, this is so clunky

419
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
Yes, yes a key a key

420
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,000
Take all

421
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,400
Definitely gonna quit these because they're a lot better than right. I know I'm dressing up as the enemy. Okay, but

422
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:46,600
That's heavy armor. We're gonna wait. Where the frick is the key or he gets the key. Okay?

423
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,040
Storm coke and drip in the same sentences oxymoronic

424
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
How do you they're both bad

425
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,200
But storm cooks are just worse the High King was leader of the good factions of Skyrim and he surrendered to the Empire because they were the

426
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,480
Less bad option. I didn't know that I thought it was like the Thalmor Embassy came in and they were like you can he worship

427
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,240
Talus anymore and I was like you can't he come into my company and tell me what I can do and can he do so

428
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
I'll pick this guy the storm cooks

429
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,520
Like you can't he just go and be doing that like that's a region's right. Where's the enemies? Oh

430
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,800
Oh

431
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:26,280
Yeah, that's right. Look at that come. Oh my god. It's so bad on PC like when we analog stick

432
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,720
Stealth goes from input. I don't know. I'm normally like a two-handed player

433
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,640
I'll always try to be an archer and I'll always end up two-handed because there's a really good freakin and

434
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
There's a really good

435
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,000
Enchantment which you can get from

436
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,600
Yes, sorry torturer. Yeah. Yeah, you're trying to tell me that a oh

437
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,800
She get in it. She annihilated him

438
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,960
No, I haven't seen him

439
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,040
You can lock pick these for like I guess we'll try it. So there's

440
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,760
You can literally smurf this if you leave and then shuggle it you hear that

441
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:31,520
Hear that if you do super gently see so we know know it's left side. Oh

442
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,920
I'm not getting pranked

443
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,480
There

444
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,800
You can literally smurf like all this stuff if you want it to be made you can pick up the stuff

445
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,640
But we are actually gonna sell it because it's good money

446
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,280
I don't think I think there's a shield behind here if you wanted to do. Yeah, if you want a shield then

447
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,480
There is one here, but I don't really bother a shield that I do two-handed

448
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,040
So we're gonna get a war hammer very shortly

449
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,080
There should be coins down here and one of these if I'm not mistaken

450
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:09,000
I guess 300 no 300 coins seems a bit extreme. Maybe 30 coins in there. We are just gonna blast through it

451
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,200
Um

452
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,560
Try two-handing mage mage is my fave. No two-handed warrior two-handed

453
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,360
Lightweight warrior and you can muck around with a bow and arrow

454
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,960
Like if you do the nightingale quest you get light armor. That's pretty sneaky

455
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,840
But the thief skilled armor especially for the stamina and like item increase is so good

456
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,880
and as for how we're gonna tackle what we do first

457
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,560
I'm going to purposefully do the companions quest line and then load a previous save

458
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,040
Because I don't like oh, sorry. Sorry. Hold on. I was out of stamina. I was trying to reach up and

459
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
that oh

460
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,840
I see just posted a very watery tweet. No way

461
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,560
the the piss corp

462
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,700
Accusations we ain't beating them today and we ain't beating them tomorrow

463
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,940
The nightingales. Yeah pure mage is hard mode. I

464
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,160
There should be something up here if I remember correctly on the right side of these rocks

465
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,780
What was it? Oh, it's just a weak coin purse

466
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:28,140
I got 14 gold. Honestly purse scaly boy. He's he's gone. He he couldn't get out, but the bars are broken now. I

467
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,440
Love the jewel wheels nightingale peeler. No, no peeler

468
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,880
That's awful, but that's hilarious at the same time

469
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,600
Right, there are spiders so if any of you are arachnophobic whoa

470
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,160
Don't worry

471
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,280
They are getting absolutely. Yeah, I've been poisoned. I think they give stamina for space

472
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,840
But yeah, please look away if you're arachnophobic. We are just gonna blast through this area

473
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
Did I come from here?

474
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,540
I think there's something to look up there. Maybe I don't know I can't

475
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:17,480
There is a bear ahead. I say look away, but you're too busy doing something on your alternative Twitter, so it's okay

476
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,300
She doesn't have to know

477
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,180
We are gonna take this for some really quick money

478
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:31,980
I believe there is an achievement for holding 100,000 gold at one stage the best way to make gold

479
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I have found is

480
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,720
by

481
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,000
enchanting and selling that jewelry and

482
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,980
There is a bit of a mild strut that I devised myself. I don't know if it's the strut

483
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,600
Survival mode survival adds the need absolutely not. What is this?

484
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,900
Survival adds the need to eat sleep and stay warm also adds challenges such as no no and no

485
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,440
I want vanilla Skyrim. Oh my god. Is that is that PC?

486
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,760
I

487
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,400
Just really am I not am I not getting achievements on Xbox for this? I don't think I am

488
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
I'm not

489
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,440
I named the stream zero to 1,000. Well, that's a very accurate over them

490
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,640
Are you playing anniversary?

491
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:29,880
In additional challenge. Oh, well, we should have gone achievement there, but we're not playing Xbox. I'm dumb

492
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:37,180
Imagine having to eat each 10 cheese wheels. Um, so there is a really easy mine

493
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,780
You can clear out. I think it will give us two handed. Um, that's just there to head

494
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:49,980
It's like right in your oh, actually. Sorry the standard stones first standing stones. I believe there are 12 standing stones which give you a

495
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:57,140
Certain boosts such as a faster leveling XP under certain things. So there's a mage stone

496
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:02,560
There's a thief stone and there is a warrior stone, but there's different ones as well one

497
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,160
I believe is like a mule stone where you just straight up can carry more items on your persons

498
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,600
Yeah, literally activate thief activate mage activate warrior. We are gonna do thief

499
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,120
Are we gonna do thief what's warrior I've forgotten

500
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,080
Right, we'll do warrior normally I do thief but we will we're gonna clear out this mine very quickly

501
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:33,820
We're just gonna pick up ingredients as we go along the way of the stones the way work. Yeah, there should be achievement to find them all. Yes

502
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,580
Well

503
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:44,860
So that just not have achievements at all because I'm not I'm playing on Xbox game pass, but it's not like instance to

504
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,140
Xbox

505
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,400
Don't be too afraid of the wolves on the

506
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,740
They are to hit they can give you rock joint. Oh, I've gone past the mine already

507
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,180
They can give you

508
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,480
Is it no, it's a rock joint or is it lockjaw? I

509
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,240
Think it's rock joint. Oh

510
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:16,220
My memory of me I've gone so past this mine shaft. Yeah, here we go. Right. There should be a bad day out here. Hello

511
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

512
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:28,560
You're playing a novice. No, no, these accusations are unfound. It is rock. I thought that but strong eight

513
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,720
Where is the

514
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,000
Blarney and yes, I know the Blarney stone. What?

515
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
Are you trying to make a ballamore joke?

516
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,360
There's a trip wire here in this mine, but don't worry about it

517
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:49,200
As I said, you can please get him up whatever level you want. I like blasting through and just absolutely annihilate and take this

518
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,360
Like it's so good. There are some later stages were even been on easy mode. Isn't that bad?

519
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,080
Although I have to admit. I guess this is registering as PC Skyrim and

520
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,740
It's quite different. Oh, this is so sad. They made this person mine themselves to death

521
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,280
They've had me working down here for days now. It's not the time that's getting to me though. It's these tunnels

522
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,440
I've told this countless times now to add extra support to the weak sections of the tunnel

523
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:23,220
If only we had more of these wooden beams that were we reinforced with bronze bottoms

524
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:28,220
Honestly, if I hear the earth shift one more time above my head, I'm so stressed. I may stop drinking for good

525
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:33,340
I mean, what's a Nord without his mead and he died because of a collapse in

526
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,420
So my granddad was a miner

527
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:42,380
and he used to tell me really rough stories about

528
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
Um

529
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:51,640
The he is like being in the mineshaft and all of that and they had a mine collapse and

530
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,920
Within two minutes. They had already killed the guy out and he was gone like he

531
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,600
Parish it was great. I may a minor. Yes

532
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,440
and

533
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,080
They do I think bandits normally have like a lockpick and coin, but it's not really the best

534
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,900
and

535
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,980
You can't just like straight up grab this shit, but there is a big chest in here

536
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:23,780
So we're just gonna clear out the way unless we oh, I was gonna say unless we speak but the guy's right there

537
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:29,420
And yeah, but like my granddad used to talk so openly about the

538
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,820
We just got it just like

539
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,020
Callers. Oh, no, hold on. Everyone knows I'm bad at log-picking now

540
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:43,480
Um, okay, we've got our first. What are you 20 damage rate 20 damage?

541
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,920
He like spoke so openly about it and I'm like

542
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,320
Granddad

543
00:48:53,320 --> 00:49:00,240
Granddad, that's just straight up like stuff. That's like man-made like horrors beyond comprend comprehension type stuff

544
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,920
this chest

545
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,900
Okay, we're definitely on PC cuz amber does

546
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,780
Not look like that. What the heck?

547
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:17,580
What the heck? I've never seen that in Skyrim before am I going crazy or

548
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,580
I don't know

549
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,780
Right don't get ready to swing

550
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,900
Oh

551
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,320
Oh

552
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,760
And if the book is valued at 50 coins or more

553
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,580
You will level up reading that book if you are ever in a section and you're like what the heck are all these books if that book is

554
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,580
valued at 50

555
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,260
Septim or more then it is actually a skill book. Oh

556
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,200
Oh my god, that's so satisfying

557
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,920
That's so freaking satisfying

558
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,240
Hold on a minute. Yeah, that's a yeah, bone archer

559
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:08,800
Um, I think there's a tiny little chest on the edge here. I think there's a little bug with a difficulty

560
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,000
No, not at all. I'm playing on. Oh wait. It's just an a vein

561
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:19,720
If you didn't know and these are called veins when you can see the ore sticking out from the wall

562
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:26,720
It's quite interesting. Honestly, maybe I should talk about mining because my granddad spoke to me in big detail about it

563
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,980
and

564
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:36,500
Like how they used to come out and like their eyes really bloodshot red and everything and have I missed that chest back there?

565
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,980
I think I have but it's not a big deal

566
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,780
Yeah, I thought that and I just like I was like I've missed that chest having a bit fine

567
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,820
If you run where your weapon out your stamina will decrease, but that's okay. You don't really need it

568
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:58,180
Especially when you're just so good at the game like playing legendary mode like as I'm playing right now

569
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:03,580
If you didn't know I'm playing legendary mode like just because I'm such a pro everything becomes really easy

570
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:08,660
And you just have to like understand the strats as long as you like swing first

571
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:15,660
Basically, you win every fight and the reason why they hardly do any damage to me is

572
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,780
Because I have such high defense, of course and not any other reason

573
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,940
If you're looking for work, go see pot at the main rail off said you could help me

574
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,660
Reload you know him

575
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:35,180
He's a friend. He promised you could help we escaped from the amperials together did

576
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,340
We heard that all free cause she lied as easily should breathe. What are you talking about? This is legendary

577
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:50,140
Literally like I know it's hard to believe that a beach over is just so good at skyrim

578
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,260
That they can play legendary mode as casually as I can

579
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,140
But it's just it's just the way it is. Okay

580
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:04,860
So the area is now just discovering that dragons are coming back

581
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Legendary easy one never heard of it

582
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,780
Legendary is easy mode because I'm just so skilled at this game

583
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,340
Open options and show that it's legendary fine. I will

584
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:28,620
I will show that it's legendary. Oh look what's over there? Hold on. What's over there?

585
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,180
Look a little to the left

586
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:35,660
Look a little to the left. See I thought see I told you it was legendary. I don't know

587
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,620
See

588
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:43,900
I don't know why you doubted me for a millisecond why this isn't legendary like I'm just that

589
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:51,340
Oh, oh my god, like did you guys see what I see just posted on our alternative Twitter? Oh my god. Yeah

590
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,340
Yeah, no, it's crazy. Oh my god. I don't know how she did that

591
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,740
Oh

592
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,300
Yeah

593
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
At least now

594
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:19,420
Okay, uh, we are gonna go ahead and just deliver the news to um the yarl of

595
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:26,940
Dragons reach that's not the name of the town of white run. We are gonna. Oh something's at me. Oh, it's a crab

596
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,620
Get up, please

597
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,620
Uh, there should be wolves up ahead, but don't worry

598
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:38,220
Did stroney just look wow actually the legendary wait mome

599
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,420
Fae and uh

600
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,300
Stroneeing the truth

601
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,940
Did you just hit no not at all? I don't know what you're talking about

602
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:56,540
Well can't fake proof like that. You're clearly a true gamer. Thank you. I appreciate it. I don't know why sometimes

603
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,140
Look, it's a hard pill to swallow to admit that sometimes

604
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,540
You know a girl may be better than you at a game, but that's okay. That's okay

605
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:10,540
You know, I'll stroke your ego. You stroke mine. You admit that I'm a legendary Skyrim player and admit that

606
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,180

The dark brotherhood line I can hear a child in the game. Please stop

692
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:14,540
Please cease your your dialogue. The yarrow said you had a project you needed help with

693
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:19,820
Project you think you could help me wait. You need to spare his life. He always attacks

01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:35,100
You need to end all the assassins quest and spare him. I could just warn he attacks me every time

697
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:42,860
I spare him. Are you squinting me right now? I'm such a fake gamer. Oh, yes, my favorite skyrim gargled ball mass

01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,380
He's not

700
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:52,220
Look, he's not the worst yarrow, but he's a bit funny in the head. Okay

701
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,260
He could have he could have acted a bit more

702
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,140

Anyway, we'll let them keep yapping away because we're about to unlock our dragon born powers

708
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:34,460
Is that john skyrim from the hit legendary show skyrim?

709
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:39,580
Yeah, but at the end of the fight you can decide to kill him or go away

710
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:46,860
I could have sworn he attacks me on xbox. I'm wondering if it's possible

711
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:51,340
Um, there might be a few coded differences

712
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,860
Battleborn give me your money. I don't have any money

713
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:02,780
Why didn't they hire me to be the mpc's like seriously? Could you imagine me like hanging a boot?

01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:27,180
Um, I'm actually I'm having a mental debate right now

718
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,340
Um

719
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:38,300
So because we're not currently getting achievements like on steam or

720
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,260
here

721
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:49,100
I'm wondering if I should do a short two hour stream then come back and do the monetization stream possibly

722
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:53,660
I'm having to master debate about that. Um

723
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,460
Oh my god, there's a firefly

724
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:01,180
You cannot believe your eyes like 10 million fireflies

725
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:04,540
Let out the world as I fail asleep

726

Planet air

727
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,460
turns

728
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,540
It's hard to stay awake when I'd rather be asleep

729
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,220
Everything is never as it seems

730
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:26,380
He's half fall asleep. Uh, there are wolves currently biting my ankles, but it's fine

731
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:30,940
Oh, oh, no, it's not. I'm gonna get lock joints perish

732
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,700
Be gone

733
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,260
You can meet sister outside white run before doing the burp

734
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,620
Dark brother. Yes, you can meet him in his travels. It's possible

735
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:47,500
But you just have to beat him up first and the it's from UG. Can't wait for karaoke sneak peek at the next concert

It was like a really big song. I was like, can I believe your eyes like 10 million fireflies?

739
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,380
Let out the world as I fail asleep

740
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:09,820
These are bandits. I can't remember what the loot is up here

741
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,620

The kill counts in this game are so ridiculous literally bludgeoned him to death

749
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:47,420
Um, I'll still leave the the light armor on. I know why are you doing two-handed with light armor?

750
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
Look, I just like light armor. Okay

751
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:53,660
Heavy armor. You'll never guess what heavy armor takes up a lot of room and it's heavy

752
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,140

758
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,460
Oh, I remember her

759
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:27,260
Going up these stairs for the first time and I was absolutely terrified of everything in this game

760
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,500
Oh

01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:35,740
And I was I was probably oh, it's probably just the baby playing on the medium difficulty the default

762
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:41,500
Uh, oh, don't worry. We didn't actually get hit. Oh, we didn't get hit. That was called a whiff

763
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:46,380
That's that's what's known as a whiff in video games. Don't worry. Don't worry. We're still fine

764
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:53,500
No, the guy oh someone's shooting at me. I heard that bone. I don't know. Can I confess something if I

Ever play skyrim nowadays. I cheat with 300 speed

766
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:01,820
In speed malt command. What's that? I don't even know what that is. Uh

767
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,660
There should be a little dialogue. Did I have a bow and arrow?

768
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,180
I don't actually think I have a arrow

769
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:12,300
I had the chance to pick up a bow and I didn't

770
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,500
That's what I get for

771
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:17,820
No, don't worry

772
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,540
Oh, we're doing the golden claw. Oh my god

773
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:25,420
Right, I'm actually gonna pick up our bow for moments like that where we could legit just grab that stuff

774
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,420
There should be a little chest here. Oh, okay

775
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,060
Yeah, I'm a wee glaze. Go kiss

776
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:38,860
Oh such a good lock pick up 47 gold look we're not exactly breaking the bank here

777
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,580
Right. I think what I'll do

778
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,980
tomorrow

779
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,900
I'm just thinking

780
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:53,020
Why am I why I'm I'm so dumb and set this up but not to be on xbox game pass

781
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:59,420
Um, because I'm not getting any achievements. I think we'll do it. I'll play for two hours and we'll redirect into sheepsters

782
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:05,340
When she comes up and then I will replay everything that I achieved basically

783
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,860
Oh, this is supposed to be a tutorial if you don't

784
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:13,660
I've just upset him. He pulls it to show you that it's wrong

785
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,580
And I think he perishes here

786
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,580
But he's yeah

787
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:26,780
Yeah, it's like no health. So it's uh snake snake dolphin

788
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:33,740
You could just run the do the campaign and do monetization. Yeah

789
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,620
or yeah, actually maybe

790
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,780
um

791
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:44,140
Maybe we just do the main campaigns. I wouldn't actually I would be quite happy

792
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:51,580
and satisfied with skyrim again if the book is worth more than 50 gold if we do the main quest lines instead

793
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,980
then

794
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:59,820
I would actually be happy with what we've achieved with skyrim and we can oh my god. I forgot there's rats here. Hold on

795
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,220
Oh, I'm getting bit to death. Oh Mars. Oh my god. The swing is so bad

796
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:08,540
This swing is terrible. I know I should level up. I'm saving it

797
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:12,220
If you didn't know leveling up actually fully heals you. So if you're ever getting a

798
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,020
In a bit of a pickle

799
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,020
Why didn't you warn him?

800
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:20,620
Yes, actually, I wouldn't mind that today. We'll do an endurance stream if that's okay

801
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,900
Oh, this is freaking terrifying

802
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:31,660
Oh, he's actually quite a busy boy like honestly

803
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,620
Oh my god, he's just stabbed me

804
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,660
Wait, something else is red. I don't know. Hi

805
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,020
Ow, my ankle

806
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:46,140
Do you know see that big massive spider and you pick on me? You pick on me?

807
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,940
Right. Hello

808
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,420
Again

809
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,420
The rest the rest are winning

810
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,580
please

811
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,540
Please you have this whole chamber and you pick on me

812
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,140
Red I

813
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,140
this cold

814
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:13,340
He's actually one of the stronger enemies in the dungeon be as a script to death and insta dies

815
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,060
Where's the golden claw?

816
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,540
It works the claw the markings the door in the hall of stories. I know how they all fit together

817
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,500
Help me down and I'll show you

818
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:28,940
Same like a bandit attacking after take down a dragon literally hand over the claw first

819
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:34,940
Does it look like I could move you have to cut me down. Okay. No, you're kind of real for that. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking

820
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:40,860
It's coming loose. I can feel it. Hello. I'm sure you wouldn't betray me

821
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,500
Would you?

822
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,500
Why should I share the treasure with anyone?

823
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,220
Why are you are you just leading me there?

824
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,020
You feel I'm not sharing it with anyone

825
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,460
Is he about to get

826
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,460
rolled by a drogger

827
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:59,260
Is he

828
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:04,460
I knew it. He is wait. Sorry. There's one behind me

829
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:12,300
He actually does I didn't know he was scripted to do that. I always kill him instantly

830
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:19,820
I saw mudcrabs the other day horrible creatures. Wait. Yeah, so it's on his person. Should we read his journal?

831
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,700
Left trigger read

832
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:28,700
My fingers are trembling the golden claws finally in my hands and with it the power of the ancient nordic heroes that

833
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:35,980
Fool lucian valerius has no idea that his favorite store decoration was actually the key to bleak falls

834
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:41,740
Tharu now I just need to get to the hall of stories and unlock the door the legends say

835
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:45,180
There is a test that the nord's put in place to keep the unworthy way

836
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:50,380
But that when you have the golden claw the solution is in the palm of your hand

837
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:57,340
Oh, shit. Okay. I saw that coming. I'm so sorry. I saw that coming. I stood right on that trap

838
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:01,340
Oh, shit. Why when I use a stamina move

839
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:07,500
Stop holding the freaking stamina bar. Holy crap. When I do a stamina move it like makes me go to the side

840
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:12,060
Literally the only thing that's going to hurt me in this game is um

841
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,540
Is uh traps nothing else

842
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,980
Spider girl for gen two

843
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,700
Hmm

844
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:31,340
So there's one I don't want to talk about it too much just for my baby girls like

845
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:36,780
We are only a weekend. Wait, is there a drogger here? I'm a little crazy. No, um

846
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:43,020
Obviously, I don't want to disrespect the baby girls. Um, I was talking to them

847
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,100
about like how development works behind the scenes

848
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,460
um

849
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:53,500
And unfortunately, I used my words pretty poorly and it made some of them a bit uncomfortable

850
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:59,260
So I don't really like talking about it too much. Um, but it's due to my poor communication

851
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,820
It's not due to the the girls in any way

852
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,460
um

853
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,940
But I what I can say is that

854
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,940
development takes a year at least

855
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,660
for uh generation

856
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,860
Like an entire generation if you will

857
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:18,860
um

858
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:23,340
And like I I don't want to say too much to make the girls feel like oh

859
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:29,420
I'm just like casting them aside because like oh shiny gen two like no, that's absolutely not the case like

860
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,780
I have said this from the start. Um if there is going to be a gen two

861
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,340
It will be at least a year away like I am

862
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:43,580
I am not rushing gens out just for the sake of doing it. That's that's so unbelievably disrespectful

863
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:46,620
To the girls who have placed faith in me

864
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,540
um, and

865
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:53,420
Like I still have a load of plans like now that the girls are in the stage of being monetized. Um

866
01:13:53,980 --> 01:14:00,860
There's a lot of plans we can now execute. Um, like shorts as well. There's a lot of shorts that need to be made. Um, we have a fantastic

867
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:06,060
shorts editor who did a Hail Mary to the website and applied themselves

868
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,860
Um, and he's he's been a fantastic shorts editor

869
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,060
He's pretty much done the majority of the work. We have a a second one

870
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:19,260
Who's quite busy at the moment, but we are gonna, you know, test if it's all good and if it's all good then

871
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,620
You know, we've got a lot of shorts play coming up. Um

872
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,620
confirmed not a black company. I I hope not I

873
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:32,700
I said to the girls wholeheartedly and hopefully they will voucher. They remember I said something along the lines

874
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:40,060
I oh, I wasn't paying attention. Sorry. Um, I said if I ever do anything to you that is

875
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:48,540
Like absolutely hurting you that hurts you in any way that is a completely negative experience with me in any way

876
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:55,100
Take me out back and shoot me. Um, like it was it's why I was very serious in the interview

877
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:59,100
Uh, they they are welcome to talk about the interview if they would like, um, am I going the wrong way?

878
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,900
Am I going back the way I came? No, I'm not. Um

879
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,620
I said to them

880
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:09,980
Do not ever refer to me as your boss. Do not ever think of me as like a superior or something like that

881
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,460
Um, that's definitely not

882
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:20,220
Ever how I want you to think like I am literally like in this with you. We're we're memeing about we're figuring out what we want to do like, um

883
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:29,660
Definitely take me out back and shoot me. I'm so serious. Do not ever ever let me like oh, that's

884
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:34,300
It does more damage. Um, like do not ever take me like

885
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,140
You know, what's that saying you live long enough to become the villain

886
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,820
Don't ever let me live become don't ever let me live long enough to become the villain

887
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,340
Take me out back and shoot me like oh

888
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:49,740
It's why from the get go like if the girls sign on their contract for another year. Uh, we the company

889
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,260
um

890
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:56,460
We offer an alternative outfit on the house for them as well as their pay increase

891
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:57,580
goes

892
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:02,540
Sorry, I'm fucking try to like remember the the attack pattern and where the droggers spawn in this

893
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:05,100
we'll talk about this but um

894
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,780
Like uh, we definitely wanted to raise their income and the split goes

895
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:13,900
85 15 again kind of showing that we're not really here for grade. We're kind of here for

896
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,540
alternative reasons. Um

897
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,420
So is there an actual see oh, I don't own the company

898
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:23,020
Like I genuinely wholeheartedly my my my name

899
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,100
I'm

900
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:31,340
Basically my role is what is a creative director. I already if you look on the

901
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:36,860
Thingy it'll tell you what the code is but you just need to move these twice and then you've got the correct code

902
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:40,860
Unless it's different on pc. Uh, but basically I'm

903
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:47,180
I was the creative director because I did used to have the scripts like I used to be the script maker

904
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:54,220
I no longer have that there's no a manager. All I do right now is stream as strone as me

905
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:59,660
Um, and I send away shorts like I literally went into the girls dms

906
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,460
Last night like after streams

907
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:07,740
And I was like, hey, um, can I get an audio of you saying this and they're like, yeah, I'll do it in the morning

908
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,820
Like that's that's all I do

909
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:15,820
Uh, you're a cco. I don't know what a cco is. You're already like the opposite of a black company

910
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:18,700
Ah

911
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,700
I mean you're ready to be dragonborn

912
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:24,300
Word of power learn force

913
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,940
unrelenting force

914
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:28,940
force

915
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:33,260
um, there's always an overlord or um some sort of

916
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,500
um

917
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:41,900
Protector of the words of power, which you know makes sense all things considered

918
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:44,540
Uh, oh, we're gonna break that down

919
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,460
Chief creative officer, um

920
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:56,540
Nah, I've uh, we're just gonna break everything down and

921
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,900
I think there's a hidden chest by this waterfall

922
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,260
Although I could be completely wrong. Oh, well, no

923
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:08,460
Damn my memory coming through it's been how many years since I played this game and I'm like, yeah

924
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:12,300
There's a wee hidden chest here. Then there's this there and then you can pick this up and then I do that

925
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,020
Oh my god. So mlg pro honestly, um

926
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,020
Wow you a

927
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:24,140
Cuted that based on honestly force sounds like the german word foo, which means food

928
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:29,420
Oh, did you like my foos last night? Huh? Did did you like them streams?

929
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:33,100
Tell me I don't have I feel so feminine right now

930
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,660
I'm like the most feminine

931
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:40,220
I might get more pedicures because honestly that that that was so fun. I enjoyed it

932
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:45,980
The woman was so like both the women were so lovely. I felt so flustered in that stream though

933
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:48,380
I hope it didn't come across too badly

934
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:54,140
But I was like so out of my element like when I saw the time was an hour until

935
01:18:54,940 --> 01:19:01,980
A sheepsters was up. I was like, oh my god. What have I done? Like, how did I speedrun it? It's like so quickly

936
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,140
Have you got back the tool?

937
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:09,660
Um, it's still unfortunately very

938
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:16,860
Cut up. So I've still got a wee bandaid on it. I washed it in the bath

939
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:21,900
Uh, she got me good. All I'm gonna say is she got me good. Like it was deep

940
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:26,220
You know, like the side the smaller side part of your tool cuts straight into that

941
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:31,820
She was really sorry though, but it's fine like stuff happens honestly

942
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:35,740
And I believe she was new I believe she was new to the establishment. So it's better to

943
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:40,780
It's better for her to make a mistake on me because like hopefully I'm nice and understanding

944
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:44,380
And they're like, I wouldn't say anything mean. I was like, oh, you're fine. Like don't worry about it

945
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:48,860
Um, and like the other women was like translating for her because she didn't speak English

946
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:52,380
And I was like, it's fine. So I'm kind of glad she made that mistake on me

947
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:59,020
Rather than someone else who would have been like a Karen basically like I'm not gonna say anything about Australia, but um

948
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:02,540
I have I have heard some

949
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,540
unique

950
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:10,940
Conversations occur. I'm not even paying attention to the plot because I'm too busy rambling about my my life. Um

951
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,900
Look forward to the seat stream. Anyway

952
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:18,460
Who slashed your toe the lady that was doing my pedicure?

953
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:23,500
Uh, oh god, I'm not like paying attention to the plot. Oh, right. We've just handed over the dragon stone

954
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,220
He's gonna translate it or something and then they're gonna know that's uh

955
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:31,260
The things are back. Uh, this is a map of Skyrim. It's very big. We're in white run right now

956
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:37,900
Um, we're actually gonna take a horse and carriage and go to rift in because I want to do the thieves guild quest. Yippee

957
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,780
It's my favorite quest

958
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,100
um

959
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,660
But yes, so that's the Skyrim

01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,740
town that's the sky. Hey, sorry, that's an uh

961
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:53,280
Stormcork town stormcork

962
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,140
Is winterhold stormcork?

963
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:00,140
Solitude is the medium at the legion. It's not

964
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,500
Hey, ho

965
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,500
Stroney here with my weekday donation telling you I'm off to work

01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,700
Okay, enjoy your legendary mode conquest. Thank you so much. Yes

968
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,060

Excited to see some of it. Yeah. Thank you so much for the tip. Please enjoy work tiny spiny or tiny spinning

970
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,860
One of the other

Okay, we're listening to plot. Okay

972
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:29,420
Um, but yes, legendary mode conquest. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, yeah

973
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:34,380
I think maybe we'll do just one big endurance Skyrim stream and then tomorrow we'll do monetization

974
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,820
Because since we're not really getting achievements is not really

975
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,740
Too much need your help again. What do you need my help with?

976
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:47,980
Oh, yes, sorry, I completely forgot we're about to go get our dragon power

977
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:54,380
In order to be the dragon born and utilize our powers. We have to perish dragons

978
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:02,300
So we're about to get our first shout power winterhold is the stormcork capital. Yeah

979
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:09,980
The best question. Yeah, we're going to do the thieves guild. We're also going to bring the thieves guild back to its glory

980
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:16,540
But i'm going to need your guys's help for the tally. Um, you can just run ahead of arolith

981
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:19,340
Um, it's not necessary to hang about

982
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:24,620
Shawnee has the wrong kind of tism to pay attention to multiple things. That was yeah, I can't do that

983
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,700
I can like hyper

984
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:33,340
This is they call it hyper focus. I don't think it's even hyper focus. I'm not focused at all. I'm just having a really good time

985
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:39,900
Um, but yeah, I'm very lucky that I don't experience like burnout or anything. I'm like, yeah, I can't really

986
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:45,740
Oh, sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that you're having such a tough time. Oh, yeah

987
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,820
um

988
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:53,500
All right, hold on. I'm gonna unlock this little windmill as a landmarker when you

989
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,980
Papaga farm as terrible

990
01:22:56,380 --> 01:23:01,660
When you discover a landmark you can fast travel to it which gets you

991
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,620
Around a lot faster

992
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:07,740
um

993
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:14,380
Did you know that with frostbills you can make dragons land? I did not know that I always use that shout

994
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:19,500
Um to get them to land. Oh, it's so pretty. Look at the butterfly

995
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:24,220
Oh my god catch the butterfly rip its wings off for alchemy

996
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,940
yes

997
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,940
Oh

998
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:35,980
Okay, now we need to wait for the game to hurry up with the mpc. So we're just gonna wait an hour

999
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,460
Oh, there we go. Boom. Just like that

1000
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:42,380
No burnout. Look at you

1001
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:48,860
I just don't experience it. I like I've never experienced that. I've never had issues with that. I don't feel it like

1002
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:55,180
I can feel tired like I can be like, oh, I need to go get some like tea and some food

1003
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:59,500
And then we'll play like for a couple of more hours. I can do that. No problem. Like at all

1004
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:05,180
I think the only time I feel I just feel frustrated that I don't have more time

1005
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:10,300
Like when I was doing all the ASMR collabs like writing all the scripts back to back

1006
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:16,140
Um, actually I knew girl, uh, I reached out to a new girl and I was like, hey, you want to do ASMR

1007
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:21,740
And she was like, I want to do some more and she's like, I know a lot about you and I was like, oh, that's embarrassing

1008
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:27,020
Um, but if you know a lot about me, then you know how easy this collab is gonna be because I'll do all the work

1009
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:35,340
Um, but like I don't mind doing all the work if anyone's lurking. Uh, I don't mind doing the work. I actually prefer it

1010
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,220
Um, because it makes things a lot easier

1011
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,340
And make every arrow count

1012
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:44,700
I used to not experience burnout playing games, but now I do which is a shame

1013
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:49,340
No, so if you can't play video games, that's like life burnout

1014
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:54,460
Like if you would rather watch someone else play video games than like play it yourself

1015
01:24:55,820 --> 01:25:00,940
Live streaming doesn't count because you're you're being tortured to watch me play Skyrim via

1016
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:05,100
My controller where the heck is this dragon? Is he on the floor? Oh, it is

1017
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,300
Okay

1018
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,620
Oh, let's spank his butt

1019
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:11,820
Ah

1020
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:17,580
Whoa, it's actually kind of hurt me a little bit. No, you're stinking. You're so stinking

1021
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,820
Um

1022
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:25,100
See they've been on top. Hey stamina bar is greet out only HP

1023
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:27,740
What's the way? Oh, it's landed again

1024
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,860
Oh, you're hurting me

1025
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:38,140
Stop it. You're hurting me. Oh look at that two hand is 32. I should probably level that up

1026
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:43,900
Hey, we are gonna pick up the dragon bones. These are like why on earth? Oh, he must eat a weight ring guard

1027
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:46,220
um

1028
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:48,540
No

1029
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:53,820
So now this is where the NPCs get really weird around you. I don't know what he's fighting right now

1030
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:59,260
He's locked on something a mud crab. Maybe nearby. There's mud crabs over that way

1031
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:06,140
Today I learned from a scottish cut of fish. I may have burned out. Yes. So if you'd rather

1032
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,740
Um, if you would rather

1033
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:13,020
Um

1034
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,580
Wow

1035
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:23,580
Where that where the heck I think he's supposed to come up to me. Is it you?

1036
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,860
I'm glad you're on outside

1037
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:38,460
Uh normally an NPC walks up to you and goes oh my god, you are the dragonborn in a really poor like swedish accent

1038
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,780
Uh

1039
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:46,860
What type of two hand are we specializing in hammer axe sword those there's

1040
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,980
Aren't those one handed

1041
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:52,220
I'm just gonna pick up with the apocrity

1042
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,780
Apocrity something like that

1043
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:57,180
Did he die? I guess they may have perished

1044
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:05,340
Yeah, I've been uninspired by the games to play recently. So I prefer watching others play. Yes. I think that is a symptom of burnout because of

1045
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,460
Oh

1046
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:16,780
I think the gray beards have summoned us

1047
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:20,860
Oh, it's khaji

1048
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:26,380
We're the good boy. Hey, push push push. Do you seek to make a purchase?

1049
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:32,380
Uh, uh, what have you got for sale? I'm gonna just sell some of my stuff that I don't want

1050
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:35,980
Uh, I'm gonna break that break it down now

1051
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:44,540
I'm gonna break all this stuff down. It's just so we're not too heavy. Yeah, I can break those down

1052
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:49,020
Take rid of that. We did that. We're gonna break it down

1053
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:53,020
I've got a brook pass and a Nord mead

1054
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:59,980
Resurrect and restore my energy. Would I do amber? I'll just sell that. I don't really know

1055
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:02,620
Oh, I definitely want to sell this

1056
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:07,020
I like how my speech gets better just selling stuff in general like

1057
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:10,940
You always want to hold on to soul gems. Uh, they're very important

1058
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:16,860
May the road lead to oh, that's why I always say safe travels land strider because of this game

1059
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,420
I think it's really cute. Just safe travels land strider

1060
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,620
khaji roleplay stream

1061
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,100
Uh

1062
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:29,500
I actually don't know how to purr. You know how some v-tubers can purr like

1063
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:33,580
Uh, I can't do it. I can only roll my r by the pope

1064
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:39,020
Even the graybeards screaming your name strani you absolute sexy player

1065
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,660
Thank you for the tip. Sorry. Yeah, or sorry. Yeah

1066
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,380
I think they're y'all

1067
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,620
ebw

1068
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:51,180
Tajita's wearers if you have coin

1069
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:57,740
I told you you're not alone. We're not causing trouble. Uh, so they're looking for

1070
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:04,460
Uh, someone but we're not doing that quest right now because we're trying to zoom past this so we can go and do

1071
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,700
the

1072
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,700
Main quest of the dragonborn

1073
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,980
I'm wearing a hat with badass horns

1074
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:18,460
I'm the dover king known globally. You're nobody at all

1075
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:22,060
He was so english in those songs for no reason

1076
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:26,700
I'm just kidding. It is his accent. He's allowed to have an accent

1077
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:33,260
If it's gosh, I'm dover king known globally. You're nobody at all. Like it. Yeah

1078
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:37,900
I think the english rapping accent is a bit better than the scots

1079
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,980
Was the dragon there

1080
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:48,620
Uh, the watch tower was destroyed, but we killed the dragon. Let's just skip a few dialogue and say it turns out

1081
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:50,620
I might be dragonborn

1082
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:54,300
What do you know about the dragonborn?

1083
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:59,340
Hmm when the dragon died, I absorbed some kind of power

1084
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:07,900
The vampire DLC, I don't even think I saw that one the graybeards

1085
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,580
Okay, okay, okay, we get a blah blah blah blah wait

1086
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:18,700
Why does it say I need to keep? Oh, I need to keep talking to him. You've done a great service for me

1087
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:23,900
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, please gift me axe of white run

1088
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,340
Oh, I'm stain of the sick

1089
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:32,780
I am so sorry for creating a mess. That was a misfire. It was a misinput misinput

1090
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:37,980
Please don't fight me. I didn't mean to do that. I was the wrong the wrong button there

1091
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:43,580
Axe of white on target dies within three second fills the soul gem

1092
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,540
That's perfect because it's exactly the enchantment we want

1093
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,940
Hey, we're gonna break it down now

1094
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,700
Just breaking down everything

1095
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:57,420
Um, and we're gonna see if we can enchant our Nordic battle axe

1096
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:01,740
Although I even have soul gem. I have the world's weakest soul gem

1097
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,780
I'm gonna have to refill it so much if I end up using it

1098
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:11,820
Uh

1099
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:14,940
Uh, this is the best I can do

1100
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:17,740
Ah freaking mistake

1101
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:23,180
Uh, we're just gonna oh we're completely out of soul gems anyway

1102
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:32,380
Women yells it. I'm sorry. It was a misinput. It was a misinput. I'm so sorry. Look, I'm the I'm the thane

1103
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,700
Anyway, I'm the I'm a thane

1104
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:38,620
Oh Lydia, do you want to come with us so you can be filled with dragon bones?

1105
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:44,060
Yarl has appointed me to be your house. Follow me. I need you. Oh my god. Wait. If I got Lydia's face

1106
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,140
Am I going crazy or do I have Lydia's face?

1107
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:49,420
Wait a minute. Did I accidentally recreate Lydia?

1108
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:52,700
Wait, take take that helmet off right now

1109
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,340
I think I may have accidentally recreated Lydia. Oh

1110
01:31:58,460 --> 01:31:59,660
No

1111
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:05,100
I'm I'm such a Lydia fan boy. I recreated her as myself

1112
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:09,020
Oh my god, we even have the same nose and lips and everything

1113
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:16,380
That is hilarious. I'm so sorry Lydia. I'm just such a I must have like subconsciously made her

1114
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:24,060
This that shoutings making people nervous on it till winning Lydia cuttles for real for real

1115
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:29,980
Right. We now need to go all the way up this mount. Well, we need to go to Rorik's stead

1116
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:34,220
I versus it. Oh my god. I'm such a fake gamer. Honestly. I don't even know why you guys listen to me half the time

1117
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:43,100
Uh, Tony's copied my whole flow word for word bar for bar. It's a highland coup

1118
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,500
Excuse me little gait. Let me just close that

1119
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:51,900
Let me just close that. Oh, it's the wee highland coup. Look at this. No, uh, whoa. Whoa

1120
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,100
Look at your wee horns

1121
01:32:55,100 --> 01:33:03,740
Fun, uh, I mentioned this other day actually, uh, I had a relative that owned one and uh, the the they're actually super gentle

1122
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:07,580
Uh, but it made my relative blind in one eye lamal

1123
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:11,500
Because the horn poked his eyeball. Um, that was funny

1124
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:15,580
Uh, but it wasn't even mad at her

1125
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:20,620
It was a female highland coup. I can't even remember what he named there, but honestly, it sounds like the most scottish

1126
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:23,740
No, I don't care about your question. Shut the fuck up. Um,

1127
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:26,460
literally

1128
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:31,660
I honestly must sound so scottish to stream like oh, I have my granddad. Uh used to work in the mines

1129
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:36,380
Had a family that family member that literally owned a highland coup. Like oh my god

1130
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,740
I swear like me wonder I was raised in a bar and literally don't have manners. Like I just I never had it from the start

1131
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:50,060
A wee coup, a wee highland coup. My favorite part of a strong stream is our unofficial catchphrase. Did you know?

1132
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,940
Oh, did you know?

1133
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:54,780
Did you know?

1134
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:58,540
Uh, right, I think we're gonna manually walk there. There are gonna be wolves ahead

1135
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:04,060
But because we're playing legendary differently and I'm such an MLG pro at this game. Um

1136
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:09,100
It's honestly not problem and we might even see Cicero on the way

1137
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:13,260
It's unlikely we'll meet Cicero on the way there just because he spawns

1138
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:22,220
I find the Cicero spawns more northern west of the map and we are currently going southern east, which is the opposite

1139
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:23,980
Um

1140
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,900
Lydia

1141
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:31,580
No, hello. This war is as stupid as our feud with clan gray may need something. No

1142
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:40,940
Oh, oh, she's got a bit of them. Oh, what was that shadow freaking the honeybearing meadery. Uh, yes a bit of a bit of meadery

1143
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:44,380
Oh, wait, will we open a veal or a meadery? Why not?

1144
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,740
that seems to be the way of like

1145
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:49,340
um

1146
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:53,420
Content creators when they get in their endgame they like come out with a product. I'm like

1147
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:58,140
I think my endgame would be video games like

1148
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:02,620
Like paying to get them made like what what my my rubbish ideas are

1149
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:06,700
Um, I think that's probably my endgame. Whoa, okay

1150
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:11,820
That was that was a lot going on the screen for one for one. So

1151
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:16,540
That was quite a lot. There is a waystone up ahead. I don't think it's a good one

1152
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,420
Haggis and

1153
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,220
Neeps and ties

1154
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:26,780
Do you also live in a lone tower up on some hill? Are you?

1155
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:33,340
Wait, oh, no, is this an enemy dog? No, it's a nice dog. Hello. I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years

1156
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,420
I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years

1157
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:44,380
Are you telling me my lore story is shrek right now? You can buy dragon scale. You've not got the money for it

1158
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:46,780
our

1159
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:48,780
Wah, wah, wah

1160
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:52,460
The other drinks it may or may not contain something

1161
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:57,660
Unique to the girl. I see that skeever on the road. Don't think I can't see you. We are

1162
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:02,700
Oh, so captured that that is the noise. I like to hear honestly

1163
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:06,380
Uh, I believe there's a few skeletons up on this hill, but

1164
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:08,940
Again, nothing we can't handle

1165
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,100
Nothing we can't handle at all

1166
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:16,300
Um, as I said, we're gonna do the main quest. We're gonna do the thieves

1167
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:21,980
Um, and then hello, are you you are definitely an enemy? Oh

1168
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:27,580
I do beg your pardon, but it's all the way absolutely nothing around these parts

1169
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:32,620
And another soul capture do you have soul gem?

1170
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:36,460
Spark white cap will destroy those. Oh

1171
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,540
Oh

1172
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:40,540
Oh, how dare you

1173
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:41,820
Do you?

1174
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:46,540
Oh, wait, I think that ancient that ancient bow is stronger than what we have for our bow. Um

1175
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:51,580
Right root skeletons scared. Oh scary

1176
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:56,060
Are you squiddling me right by the pope?

1177
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:01,260
I don't like my family history every time I read my family history

1178
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:04,540
I always have to ask myself. Are we the bad guys?

1179
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,940
Monka is

1180
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:08,940
Thank you for the tip

1181
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,740
Are we the bad news

1182
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:14,300
I think my family history is like really boring

1183
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,500
It's just like, yeah

1184
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,820
Scottish and Irish

1185
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:25,660
I know that you can do like 23 and me tests to like really see where you come from

1186
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:29,420
But I actually don't uh, I don't

1187
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:34,220
Believe it's safe at all to like willingly hand over your dna like that

1188
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:39,100
Look, I know I'm starting to send like needy streamer overload where we were doing like that god speed run

1189
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:45,100
Where she you know, she got into like all the conspiracy theories and stuff, but it's not really a conspiracy thing

1190
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:48,860
I like maybe I should do a stream like that on ironically

1191
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:55,260
I'll like yeah. Um, wait, what are you attacking? You're not attacking me. Oh, you're not. Okay, that's strange

1192
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:59,820
Uh, this gaily sounded like an oblivion scaly

1193
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,780
At least you got a cool accent out of the deal. Yeah

1194
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:10,140
Um, we are just running our way over to mvark said I believe is the town name award you kind of forgot the annunciation

1195
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,340
Um

1196
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:17,100
No, I don't think it's safe either to have your dna on fail of a company. Yeah, like

1197
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:19,260
um

1198
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,260
I took like ethics class

1199
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:22,540
um

1200
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:24,220
and we were

1201
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:31,500
Discussing like how good like emergent technology is like if you haven't heard about crisper is dna fixing technology

1202
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:39,340
Essentially dna fixing. Um, it's going through a lot of lab studies and trials and all that but it's found very effective against like, um

1203
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:45,740
You know things that were previously incurable essentially or diseases that are

1204
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,860
untreatable that kind of thing um and

1205
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:53,580
The technology that can be raised from it

1206
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:59,580
Um to help people is outstanding. However, do we

1207
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,460
Do we trust such?

1208
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:07,740
Do we trust your dna sequence to be handled with care or would in theory

1209
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:14,620
Insurance help. I'm sorry. I'm literally hell. Yeah. I'm up for scotland conspiracy theory stream

1210
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:22,540
Thank you so much. Totally not big anger. Um, like I I could definitely get into it, but we were like talking about like

1211
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:29,260
Uh, didn't see one of the interest your companies get caught selling all the data. They said they wouldn't is that yes

1212
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:31,660
uh, not to mention, um

1213
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:38,140
There's like a whole rabbit hole about what data leaks are. Um, because

1214
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:40,860
um

1215
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:46,540
I don't know. I don't know if you guys care, but um, there's actually a whole other conspiracy

1216
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:53,020
Um, that data leaks aren't actually like that. It's kind of more like government demands

1217
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:56,700
Uh to have access, but they already kind of have access to a lot of things

1218
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:59,100
Especially with the technology in the state age

1219
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:04,620
But uh, maybe I shouldn't go too far down the rabbit hole. Don't want to deter anyone. Where the heck am I supposed to go?

1220
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,140
I think there's a path ahead. I'll just follow this path. Um,

1221
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:13,580
I thought we were going down the designer baby route. Oh, well that already happened

1222
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:19,340
One of the biggest examples of the designer baby route was victoria beckham's children

1223
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:25,420
You're telling me that brown-eyed lady has a 25 percent of uh, blue-eyed offspring

1224
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:29,580
And she just happened to pop out two blue-eyed children. Uh, no

1225
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:36,700
She did what is called ivf and then the dna tested and checked if the children

1226
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:39,660
And in the egg in the egg. Yes in the egg

1227
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:44,060
Uh, we're able to uh had the recessive blue eyes

1228
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:50,220
Is already being done in this day and age and that was back in 2005 or something crazy. It's one of the biggest public

1229
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:55,020
Things that are right in the faces of people that you wouldn't know about it's already occurring today

1230
01:40:55,100 --> 01:41:01,100
This also occurs with the fox p12 gene. I believe I'm so sorry if no one cares about this

1231
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:05,980
But I'll try and get through it really quickly. There's also a gene that's been identified called the fox p12

1232
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:06,780
I believe

1233
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:12,700
Um, and if you have it it means you're actually a lot smarter and able to pick up things a lot easier than someone who is

1234
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:18,700
Without this gene and uh, it's been called into question that ivf babies may also be getting tested for this

1235
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:21,580
So you have a child or offspring that may be a bit smarter than the average

1236
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:25,020
But that's just on me. Okay, uh, I'll just leave it

1237
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:28,620
Leave it there, but there there's a lot. There's a lot

1238
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:30,860
Okay

1239
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:31,820
um

1240
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:34,860
It's really interesting to continue the happen. Yes

1241
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:40,940
So a lot of people think it hasn't already occurred or the first human hasn't been cloned and dolly the first sheep was cloned in

1242
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:44,140
1964 I believe uh the no no no no no

1243
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:49,260
That's when we first were publicly allowed to be learned and to be taught about the cloning

1244
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:53,100
Um, it's already happened long ago

1245
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:58,140
You just don't get to know about it because ethnically it's messed ethnically

1246
01:41:58,620 --> 01:42:06,700
Ethically it's messed up and the public shouldn't really be allowed to access this knowledge because well it brings up a lot of questions

1247
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:09,100
Such as if you call in a person

1248
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:10,140
Do they have one soul?

1249
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:12,700
Do they share a soul and then it brings religion into question

1250
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:17,180
If you didn't know religion also helps bring in a lot of order into people's and communities lives

1251
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:19,260
And the rabbit hole goes incredibly deep

1252
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:22,860
But we can't touch on that subject too much because i'm just a vtuber playing skyrim right now

1253
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:28,300
And we're just trying to get to every head so we can talk to the graybeards to learn about our true power as the dragonborn

1254
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:30,460
As we play this game

1255
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:35,260
So yes, please don't mind me

1256
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:38,140
Oh, this is a saber cat after me. My goodness

1257
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,460
um

1258
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:42,460
But yes, uh, please

1259
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:48,220
Please let us enjoy skyrim for what it is. Anyway, that's why I don't really start talking about these subjects

1260
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:50,540
because uh

1261
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,060
Yeah, it's uh

1262
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:56,060
It's a bit scary. It's a bit scary when you look into it. Yeah, right? Uh, yeah

1263
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:00,620
Gamers for genetically engineered cat girls represent absolutely

1264
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:05,740
I'm 100% there with you the fact that nickel girls aren't real. I used to right. This sounds really bad

1265
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:09,180
I used to actually fantasize about owning a nickel girl. I don't know why I just

1266
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:13,340
I used to fantasize about like treating her really well

1267
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:18,780
And like she would have had a previous owner before me or something, but i'll treat you right baby

1268
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:24,620
I don't know why I gave me like some sort of like superior like saving complex or something

1269
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:29,500
I don't know why but like I just oh I used to fantasize about all of that

1270
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:33,660
Like especially after watching monster monster

1271
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:36,220
mom

1272
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:39,260
Um, I used to like really

1273
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:44,140
Uh, there should be a quest where you deliver something for someone

1274
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:47,340
Is it you?

1275
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:52,060
Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop. Oh, okay, right. Sorry, jeez

1276
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:54,860
Um

1277
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:59,500
If this dream doesn't demonstrate that the tism is strong and veal or literally to the box

1278
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,900
There's someone that gives you a quest

1279
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,700
Okay, we're gonna yet if you talk to this guy you can do a quest for him

1280
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:19,260
Um

1281
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:21,260
There's also a hidden

1282
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:22,940
Thing

1283
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:26,060
If you read all of these on the way up something happens

1284
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:30,460
But I've completely forgotten what happens because I've never done it before because I saw it in a video

1285
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:32,700
And I've forgotten what happened in the video

1286
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:39,580
Uh, right, let's see emblem one before the birth of men the dragons ruled all of

1287
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,980
Mondus their words

1288
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:47,260
Their word was the voice and they spoke only for true needs

1289
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:51,260
For the voice could blot out the sky and flood the land

1290
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:57,260
Well four years means more years to tease

1291
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:04,620
Honestly what necopara does to mf for me honestly

1292
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:10,860
Damn strongy the last 10 minutes rumbles deaf and I'm so sorry

1293
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:16,220
Thank you. Hypno mama. Thank you for us dino. I apologize

1294
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:19,500
Just saying cloning has never been perfect

1295
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:23,660
And there has been a growth in mental health as time has gone on

1296
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:30,140
We are all clones of our grandfathers grandmothers, but imperfect to poison the king cool

1297
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:36,780
Thank you. Thario for the tip. I could talk about um, so you know how like the older generations thing is like

1298
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:40,300
Oh the lead paint stair because they'd been exposed to lead so much

1299
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:41,980
um

1300
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:46,460
My freaking biggest thing is that they've known about micro plastics forever

1301
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:51,580
And uh, I actually got proven right. It has been supra. Wait, did I miss an emblem?

1302
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:56,940
No, I didn't hello. How are you?

1303
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:02,860
I did

1304
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:09,420
He's so cold. Yeah, maybe because your arms are out and you have your stomach is out and I can see your nip-nip like of course

1305
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:10,460
You're cold

1306
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:16,940
Right, let's read emblem two. Oh emblem two men were born and spread over the fate. Did I thank those tips?

1307
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:18,940
Thank you for us dino. Thank you. Thario

1308
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:24,620
Yeah, micro plastics are today's lead plane apparently they're in the skin of men

1309
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:29,260
Uh, are I read something about it being in the skin of men?

1310
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,660
I don't know if it's true or not or if I got trolled. I believe anything I read

1311
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:38,060
Men are born and spread over the face of mondice the dragons

1312
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:44,220
President over the crawling masses men were weak then and had no voice

1313
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:52,300
There is something about men's skin having micro plastics in it or something to do with their dingle whoppers

1314
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:57,260
Uh, you got you got plastic in your dingle whopper right now. Please be honest

1315
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:03,740
Is it have you have you heard about this? Is this true? Can you confirm you sent me a picture? Use the link marshmallow. Thank you

1316
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:09,740
Average strawny stream. Yep. Yep. Yep. Oh look shiny thing. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

1317
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:12,700
honestly

1318
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:16,700
Some someone sent me a marshmallow and they were like I know your streams you get really excited

1319
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:21,660
But if I put you on a low enough volume your rambling puts me to sleep because it just goes everywhere

1320
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:25,420
My brain can't keep up. I was like, oh, I'm so glad you like it

1321
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:32,380
Um, there's like as long as I like the note of like as long as I put you down low enough because I get really excited at random stages

1322
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:37,260
Um, actually, I'm just gonna leave my weapon out, you know, but look how badass we look

1323
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,780
Oh, actually, we're gonna get nicer armor soon because this armor is

1324
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:43,660
Is leilig young

1325
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:47,340
Uh, like your mother your mother leilig. Yeah

1326
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,980
I'll should leave

1327
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:52,700
Okay, please be emblem three so I haven't missed anything

1328
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:56,540
Uh, I don't know how to give nothing

1329
01:47:57,020 --> 01:48:02,460
Emblem three the fledging spirit of men were strong in old times unafraid to war with

1330
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:08,780
Unafraid to war with dragons and their voice, but the dragons only shouted them down and broke their hearts

1331
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:13,420
Random Netherlands, uh, yeah

1332
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:18,220
Thank you. Well, thank you. Well, we're listening to my random Dutch

1333
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:23,340
If I recall correctly all the men they tested had micro plastic in their

1334
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:30,940
Yeah, so my my biggest thing I'm on right now is that they knew about micro plastics years ago

1335
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:36,540
And oh in the name of capitalistic profits, uh, they let us all get poisoned

1336
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:43,020
But that's just me. Anyway, if anyone's wondering why I really like need to shoot my overload and that one particular, uh, achievement

1337
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,380
Uh, that one particular route you could take. Hmm. I wonder why

1338
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:49,100
Uh, we um

1339
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:55,980
I uh came across a documentary where the woman actually submitted because she did find it and she got laughed out at the company

1340
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:57,820
and

1341
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:03,980
Yeah, I was like 20 years ago, but it's been known for it's been known from the start. So it's very cruel

1342
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:10,220
She cares about our balls. Yes, please if you are a man listen to me right now

1343
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,860
I cut oh wait, hold on

1344
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:21,180
I command you to eat tomatoes. I'm not being funny. Tomatoes are the best thing you can do for your boss

1345
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:23,820
Thank you for listening to my rant. Uh

1346
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,500
I'm so serious

1347
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:30,700
Oh, someone's mad. What are you doing walking the steps?

1348
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,500
Meditating on the emblems

1349
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:37,900
I make this trip every few have I turned off the thing. Wait, why apparently?

1350
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:42,380
Tomatoes are the best thing to help your

1351
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:48,460
Ball health. I don't know why just tomatoes are really good for you. You can have it on a pizza

01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:55,100
I do not care. You can have tomato sauce on whatever food group you're eating. Uh, you can

01:49:55,980 --> 01:49:57,500
have

1354
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:04,700
Um, ravioli tomato sauce like tomato made up sauce that kind of thing, but tomatoes are yucky. Oh, I'm trying to give options

1355
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:06,460

01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:10,380
You can have a chicken parma that has tomato sauce on it. You can have

Um, sun roasted tomatoes, maybe if you like to do thingy in the oven

Very bitter. I got to eat buck choy for the first time

1366
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:58,220
It's so tasteless. I don't understand how it can be someone's favorite veggie. There's no flavor. It's bitter

1367
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:02,060
It's a bitter. Uh, there is a yeti up ahead

01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:08,940
Should we snipe him?

Oh, well, he's found me now. Hasn't he? I messed that one up didn't I?

Okay, I was a bit early on the swing. I was a bit early. It's okay. Better. Where are you?

Uh, we are playing legendary mode, which is the reason why we need to get move on

1378
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,940
But we need to read the emblem first

1379
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:41,580
Man prevailed shouting Alduin out of the world

01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:48,460
Providing for all that their voice too was strong although their sacrifice were many fold. Oh, yes

01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:59,020
Oh, he's so strong and of course he has long arms just to really

1383
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:04,220
Emphasize how much I despise the design of long armed enemies

1384
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:06,540
They knew

1385
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:08,540
Can I push him back?

1386
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:11,500
Go away

Oh, it's out of range. Right. Where's the emblem emblem emblem emblem? This looks like an emblem emblem emblem

1388

What's this

1389
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:23,980
emblem six

1390
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:27,340
The roaring tongues the sky children conquer

1391
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:32,940
Bounding the first empire with sword and voice whilst the dragons withdrew from this world

1392

Am I still getting can I hide from him?

1393
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:39,740
Can he still see me? No

1394
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:47,180
Is he coded to come all the way this way? I forget the sky room's like pretty sandboxed. So I think he can come all this way

1395
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:49,820
Can he come?

1396
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:51,820
Is he still coming?

1397
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:54,220
I'm like I'm like hiding behind this pillar. Is he there?

1398
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:00,220
It's okay. It's okay

1399
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:04,220
Level up it gives full health. Oh, I forgot about that

1400
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:08,380
You guys should be playing I should be watching you guys play

1401
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:12,780
Should I do a stream like that where I commentate over your guys's gameplay on stuff?

1402
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:15,740

1405
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,100

For years all silent the gray bird spoke one name

1413
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:53,100
I said that's so weird

1414
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,620

Female viewers 0 to 10 or 10 30 percent

1431
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:08,060

1434
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:18,620
Streamers get a bit hung up on like oh look at my female viewer ratio type thing and I'm like if you're a chick that can hang out

1435
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:25,100
Then you're a chick that can hang out, you know, but I do understand and I will never not ever

1439
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:45,900
Like oh check me out. I've got I've got this percentage in gender and it was like whoever's hanging out is hanging out

1440
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:47,420
But I will acknowledge yes

1441
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:53,260
I alienate uh chicks because I often do you know, he him and we've all got tentacles

1444
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:08,060
I'm supposed to shout the old man. I remember

1445
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:15,260

1499
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:41,180
Game I thought it was a little easier on PC, but I guess the PC and the Xbox bugs are the exact freaking same

1500
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:48,380
It just works in fact it does not actually work at all

1501

Never been this far away from home

1514
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:57,260
Hey, you do have to wait for the NPCs to go through the door because if you go through the door first for some reason

1515
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:59,580
They don't show up on the other side unless you want to wait

1516
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:05,900
But we need to assist the man through the door. They're there. There you go into the yep into the court

You're up right despawned right. I'm happy with that. I definitely confirmed a despawn

Todd is meant to be the name for the president of the cheese club who is so fooled himself

02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:30,780
He thinks starfield is a good game worth a what is going on with starfield

1523
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:38,860
I saw a clip of someone taking someone's ship and someone was like they just stole his in real life money or something

1524
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:41,980
Because he took a ship that was in game

1525
02:02:43,020 --> 02:02:45,180
I don't know what's going on with starcraft citizens

1526
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:48,060
But I hope you guys are doing okay out there because I don't I don't

The one where it's been in production for like 12 billion years

1534
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:19,340
Not to be dramatic, but 12 billion years is how long it's been

02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:30,300
Now what

1550
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:33,580
What the heck is it the horn one? I think it may be the horn one. You know that

1551
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:36,380
Hold on let me check that is retrieved the horn

1552
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:44,140
Now we can ignore that and go and do the thieves guild which is much more exciting in my humble opinion

1553
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:50,220
So let's go all the way doing this hell and we'll finish this little miscellaneous and then we'll go to the thieves guild

1554
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:56,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1555
02:04:56,620 --> 02:05:00,460
I get so annoyed with these guys because they always end up killing NPCs

1556
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:06,220
You need to drag the cultists out of any environment because they always kill NPCs

1557
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:10,300
And you can't resurrect the freaking thing. So you need to wait until they come and attack you

1558
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:12,780
Get ready

1559
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:14,780
Prepare yourself

1560
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:21,580
There's so annoying

1561
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:24,460
You're no one they call dragonborn

1562
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:30,620
Yeah, the great beards. Yes, I am your lies fall on deaf ears deceiver

1563
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:36,540
The true dragonborn comes you are but he's shadow. You are but he's shadow

1564
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:41,420
All shall bear witness. I shall stand to oppose him

1565
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:46,140
Right, right Lydia Lydia

1566
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:50,060
Please do not kill any of the guards. I'm gonna be so annoyed

1567
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:53,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah perish

1568
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:55,900
super

1569
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:59,260
Okay, Lydia got smacked up, but she's okay. That's good

1570
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:06,220
We'll take that. Oh, well, what do you can add destroy? Oh, I can destroy these for a level up

1571
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:10,300
Oh, I'll take that. I'll take that. Oh, look at that. I'll take that

1572
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:19,660
Yes, I um dragonborn actually funny you mentioned that in passing. Yeah, I'm actually the dragonborn the one you

1573
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:22,620
You're the hey. Yeah, we got the DLCs too. Whoa

1574
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:25,500
I don't want to

1575
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,500
What time is it? Oh wake up

1576
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:32,700
Wake up. Oh my that actually really hurt my hands. I don't know if you heard me

1577
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:35,500
Smack my bone on the table to try and make that noise

1578
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:41,820
Is this a fresh run it is we're just gonna be doing the best quests

1579
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:47,180
Which is the main quest and thieves guild and then because I completely

1580
02:06:47,580 --> 02:06:50,220
Messed it up like a dum-dum-dummy-dum-dum-dum

1581
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:56,940
Ah, good to see you. I delivered the supplies. Wasn't it? It was anyway much appreciated

1582
02:06:57,420 --> 02:07:00,140
Here take this for your troubles. Thank you

1583
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:07,900
Uh, oh, I got 500 coin. Honestly, that's decent. We're gonna pick up ninroot because I'm pretty sure there's a ninroot quest at a later date

1584
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:10,380
Uh, right. We're gonna check the map

1585
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:13,500
Uh, and we're gonna go directly east

1586
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:16,460
Because that is where

1587
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:19,180
DLC 2

1588
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:23,260
Oh my god cute fragile girl, bro

1589
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:26,940
I could hardly open those freaking cans of fizzy juice yesterday

1590
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:30,220
I was actually getting embarrassed and then I couldn't even open up the kisses either

1591
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:36,700
I was like freaking straining for my life. Thankfully my my sweaty hands came in clutch when it came to the crisps

1592
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:40,700
Uh, oh, excuse me. Just going for a swim casually. I'm

1593
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:48,140
Uh, 500 quid is like literally so good honestly. That's like such a big booster start in the game

1594
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:51,260
Uh, right

1595
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:53,740
Redmond's hall. I don't like the sound of that

1596
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:58,620
Hey, we are just gonna try and discover the landmarks on the way. Oh wait, we can can we just use our

1597
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:01,660
Okay, we can just use our ultimate to get a bit faster

1598
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:04,700
The cultist are from myriac still see

1599
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:08,780
I don't like that one. We can maybe do vampire quest lane as well

1600
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:16,060
Vampire thieves guild and main quests where the storm cloaks win in the end. Yes, please

1601
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:19,980
I think I will be very satisfied with their Skyrim adventures doing that

1602
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:22,860
I'm clear cut and we're not kind of

1603
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:25,660
Stuck on the hill. Come on. There we go. Uh

1604
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:29,340
That definitely because

1605
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:33,580
They're freaking actually that's another thing. Uh, Todd. Why make

1606
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:40,060
Serena in the first place if I can't marry her like I'm not being funny, but probably one of the best characters

1607
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:44,300
Please leave me alone. I don't want any trouble. Okay. I'm just passing through

1608
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,700
um

1609
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:48,940
But there's done their amazing side quest honestly

1610
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:53,740
You should always pick ninroot. It's the only plant that is limited in the game. Oh

1611
02:08:54,620 --> 02:09:01,340
Are you gonna do the assassin guys quest the dark brotherhood? Actually, I really enjoy the dark brotherhood. We might end up doing that as well

1612
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:09,340
Was it sweet mother sweet mother send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear

1613
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:11,980
I remember watching that for the first time

1614
02:09:12,620 --> 02:09:17,900
And just being blown away like I loved everything about uh

1615
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:24,300
I'm going to such a such an edgy little child such an edgy little beast

1616
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:27,260
um

1617
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:32,380
Todd didn't want players to have too much fun and they couldn't keep buying the new versions of Skyrim honestly

1618
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:40,380
Uh, there is a forest ahead. I think after the forest is uh, oh look at the rabbit. Goodbye

1619
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:45,980
Oh, I made a noise. I actually feel bad now. I'm not doing that again

1620
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:51,660
If it didn't make a noise, I'd be all right. But because it made a noise. I actually generally feel really bad

1621
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,940
Just a bit

1622
02:09:55,260 --> 02:10:00,780
You know that vampire woman sara. I think that's her name. She can become human serena

1623
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:05,420
Why am I so high up? Where am I?

1624
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:13,340
Oh, I'm on the freaking outskirts of the map rifting here, right? That'll be why I can't go any higher

1625
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:15,980
But I can go higher. Why can I go higher?

1626
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:21,820
Right

1627
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:23,820
What?

1628
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:26,540
Wait, there's a pair. Oh, that's Lydia

1629
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:30,540
I was like, why is there NPCs like all the way up here? Where are they?

1630
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:34,780
What why is this wait? There's like a genuinely a path here though

1631
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:38,780
I'm looking crazy. Have I even been here before?

1632
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:48,380
Whoa, okay, we've got hunters. That's fine. Oh, there's a dragon thing up ahead

1633
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:55,660
There's like way more south side. It looks like the end. Good hunt

1634
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:20,380
Oh

1635
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:23,900
I'm in a trance right now. I'm so sorry

1636
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:43,980
Where am I genuinely what?

1637
02:11:44,940 --> 02:11:46,940
Oh

1638
02:11:47,260 --> 02:11:49,260
Don't do that

1639
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:56,700
Oh, there's rifting. Okay. I was getting so confused. I've literally just came the most difficult way possible

1640
02:11:58,300 --> 02:12:03,660
I was getting so confused. I'm like, I could have sworn rifting was east southeast

1641
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:09,500
I literally isn't I can't believe I just did that. I almost just flew myself off that

1642
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:14,460
Oh, this is the scooma then. Oh, I love this quest so much

1643
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:20,540
Okay

1644
02:12:20,620 --> 02:12:26,220
Again book is worth 50. So we got a level up. Uh, she be cotton bum is live right now

1645
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:29,100
If you're sick of Todd Howard winning again

1646
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:31,740
Uh, yeah, okay, dummy

1647
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:34,620
That is an elk. No, it's a wool

1648
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:37,340
Oh

1649
02:12:38,860 --> 02:12:43,580
Gone the most difficult way yet. It's literally the horse is currently

1650
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:45,980
um

1651
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:51,660
Vertical on the mountainside type of pathing because that I couldn't have made it any worse if I tried

1652
02:12:54,620 --> 02:13:00,140
Trying to do some scooma. Oh my god, would you do scooma with me at the next convention?

1653
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:05,980
Have the next feature reconvention list of scooma. I don't even know what it's supposed to do or mimic

1654
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:09,980
I guess supposed to maybe mimic um barrel bine

1655
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:13,340
um

1656
02:13:14,780 --> 02:13:18,540
Yeah, because everyone seems zonked out barrel bine makes you very, um

1657
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:22,540
Sedated in nature. We're

1658
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:25,340
Right rifting

1659
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:27,340
There's a wolf below me again

1660
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:33,740
I'm just decimating the wolf population. Honestly skyrim's just scotland before they eradicated the world

1661
02:13:33,740 --> 02:13:37,340
She can't convince me otherwise like right. I'm pretty sure

1662
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:42,780
If we discover. Yeah, this is the first, um thieves thing

1663
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:48,060
Farted and almost dies from fall damage 10 out of 10 far

1664
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:55,020
Actually, I haven't been in chibi stream. I'm a go over there for the first time. Yeah, give it give my gen mates a shout

1665
02:13:55,340 --> 02:14:03,100
A shout give them a shot. Um, they're absolutely fantastic in their own special way. Um, if you like burps

1666
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:05,180
she bees your gal

1667
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:07,020
um

1668
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:10,140
I feel like variety little sisters emmies you gal

1669
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:16,620
If you like adorable brats, uh, that'll call you an old man and tease you and you can tease her back

1670
02:14:17,180 --> 02:14:18,700
Aces you gal

1671
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:22,380
Uh, if you want to be babied as well as your gal

1672
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:29,260
Uh, and if you want to be uh, I don't know. What would mercy's if you want to be?

1673
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:32,940
Uh

1674
02:14:35,500 --> 02:14:38,300
If you want a jealous experience

1675
02:14:39,180 --> 02:14:41,340
watch mercy

1676
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:42,620
and then

1677
02:14:42,620 --> 02:14:47,740
I think someone described me as like the neighbor from next door that doesn't mind you

1678
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:50,460
placing your hand

1679
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:52,540
On a round object

1680
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:57,340
And I was like honestly. Yeah, that's pretty good pretty good, uh description

1681
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:04,060
Yes, there's she be live if you'd like to have a have a chicken. I don't know what game she's playing

1682
02:15:05,340 --> 02:15:08,300
Senpai to yander. Yeah, Azura called her

1683
02:15:09,340 --> 02:15:11,340
Bing Bongs. Oh

1684
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:15,020
Like hbh bros are getting looked after I saw him saying

1685
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:22,300
She be is talking. Yes, you get

1686
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:29,260
Before I let you in to rift. Yeah. Yeah visitors tax. How about we do a little persuasion

1687
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:34,060
For the privilege of entering the city. This is obviously a shake down

1688
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:40,700
Keep your boys down my speeches 22. I don't know about you

1689
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:43,580
My speeches

1690
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:49,180
I had another there she is. This is the person I normally wife

1691
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:53,820
But then again, I've become the head of the thieves guild and she absolutely despises it

1692
02:15:55,180 --> 02:15:57,180
You're not from rifting

1693
02:15:58,620 --> 02:16:00,620
My travels have taken me from high

1694
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:08,700
Morrowind at all points in between. Why are you here then many years ago? I lost my you and I I see

1695
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:11,020
Grimm's weeper so with

1696
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:12,780
um

1697
02:16:12,780 --> 02:16:14,780
Oh, this guy shakes his down as well

1698
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:20,620
Looking for trouble. Um, I'm I'm just passing. I'm not scared of you

1699
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:23,100
That's the wrong answer

1700
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:28,620
Last thing the black briars need around here is some troublemaker trying to steal a piece of the action

1701
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:34,860
Who are the black briars have ripped it in their pocket and the thieves guild watching their back

1702
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:38,140
So keep your nose out of their business. Why are you telling me all this for free?

1703
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:45,740
I'm maul. I watch the streets for them if you need dirt on anything. I'm your guy, but it'll cost you

1704
02:16:46,860 --> 02:16:51,980
You're just begging for a pagan aren't you? I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that and then you're stupider

1705
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:56,060
My persuasion check failed

1706
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:58,620
eat

1707
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:00,220
Eat

1708
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:03,260
I'm really getting tired of your excuses. Yeah, like everyone

1709
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:07,500
Uh, it's like, okay. This is the start

1710
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:13,180
But everyone wants to talk to you at once when you enter rift and I have to admit

1711
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:19,580
It's a bit of a sensory bit of a cheeky sensory overload entering in your city in skyrim. Everyone wants to talk to you

1712
02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:26,620
Right, uh, how could you possibly know that that I'm a thief the way they want

1713
02:17:27,180 --> 02:17:30,620
Right, I'm going to tell you something you should absolutely not do

1714
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:36,780
Maybe you'd like a taste the game is going to ask you to plan a ring on this person

1715
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:39,980
And it locks him up in jail and removes

1716
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:44,140
Um, a cellar from rifting don't do it

1717
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:48,460
Don't do it. Okay

1718
02:17:49,020 --> 02:17:53,660
If you do it, it removes him as a cellar and it's like another 800 coins

1719
02:17:53,660 --> 02:17:59,260
You can't get from selling stuff these symbols you see around the city. Um, these are thieves guild symbols

1720
02:17:59,260 --> 02:18:00,780
You'll see them everywhere

1721
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:06,380
It means this place has been marked or there's something of value inside like you'll see the symbols everywhere

1722
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:11,900
Um, you always want to fail this quest. It doesn't matter if you feel that you still get to become a part of the thieves guild

1723
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:14,620
and

1724
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:19,500
Oh, he's not started his dialogue clearly because uh, that should have done it

1725
02:18:27,260 --> 02:18:32,300
Why am I being told to join the rebellion? I didn't do anything. Oh come on. Hurry up

1726
02:18:32,860 --> 02:18:38,460
Oh freaking the sake I have to let the dialogue actually run out. Um

1727
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:46,460
Hello, you're having some problems with that thieves guild person. What do you want? What kind of trouble are you in?

1728
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:51,500
Tell me the details

1729
02:18:55,660 --> 02:19:01,980
I hate that you can't just skip the initial quest honestly. No, no, I'm a murderer who will not think big difference, mate

1730
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:06,060
Shawnee is the whole package replaying. What?

1731
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:12,380
I'll help you pay off your debt. Oh, thank you speak to sapphire about shaders debt

1732
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:18,300
A voice in your head told you that there's so many sellers in rifting

1733
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:25,260
There are but if you want quick access oh for goodness sake bring y'all wrap it up, buddy

1734
02:19:27,180 --> 02:19:29,180
Like this is getting it. They just make

1735
02:19:33,180 --> 02:19:35,180
That was

1736
02:19:37,740 --> 02:19:39,740
I am Lydia

1737
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:42,540
The right hand of the thing of white run

1738
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:48,700
Oh come on me just fail it so we can start the thieves quest

1739
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:54,380
He's a jeweler too. Yeah, definitely especially when you level up your um speech

1740
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:57,020
You can sell to like anyone which is so good

1741
02:19:57,500 --> 02:20:02,620
Time to go night night have fun in skyrim rest well see you in the morning when you wake up

1742
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:11,100
We're not even started the thieves quest. Come on. I'll discover this building because I've not discovered it

1743
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:18,300
Oh come on fail it. Okay. That looks like I failed it surely

1744
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:21,020
You

1745
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:27,340
Not the coughing is anyone even doing anything bring y'all

1746
02:20:33,660 --> 02:20:39,260
No one is talking or interacting when I'm done here. I'd be more than happy to sell you an elixir

1747
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:46,700
You must be all right if you've got time to come I haven't brought on xbox. It's not this broken

1748
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:53,980
Just what you see here what's he got for sale? He's got 700 coins so we can actually empty our inventory with him a little bit

1749
02:20:54,940 --> 02:20:56,940
I don't want to get too heavy

1750
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:01,980
Uh, we don't really need any of that

1751
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:09,740
Just uh get rid of it all why not? Oh, who's burping who goes there identify yourself?

1752
02:21:11,580 --> 02:21:15,900
Okay, I don't think I can destroy a staff. Oh my god this come on

1753
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:19,260
Good old scum

1754
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:27,980
Right if he's not gonna let me fail that I'll move on to um

1755
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:32,620
Austin grave a bit of Austin gravey

1756
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:35,820
In the micro wavy

1757
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:38,700
Did he purchase dragon skills from you? Yeah, he did

1758
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:41,740
You can pretty much convince him to do whatever

1759
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:45,580
especially um one of the speech perks is

1760
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:48,220
actually

1761
02:21:48,620 --> 02:21:50,620
having

1762
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:54,220
Uh being able to sell at any point

1763
02:21:54,780 --> 02:21:57,920
Shawnee you have her boar swords in her shields and you have my clock

1764
02:22:04,380 --> 02:22:06,460
Oh Ninroo I hear it

1765
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:13,820
There's a question say uh black reach

1766
02:22:14,780 --> 02:22:21,660
Which is um, I just realized this giant can fly me halfway across the map. So it should probably be a bit more careful

1767
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:33,420
Um, hey, how's Shawnee going chilling in my family's loving room watching lol. It's going good. Um, we're just trying to fail the thieves guild quest

1768
02:22:34,060 --> 02:22:39,020
So we are purposely is there a mall in my room? Hold on. I'm about to scream

1769
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:44,940
Is there a mall? I'm not being pranked. I think my eyeballs are pranking me. Okay. I think I'm okay

1770
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:47,740
Okay, I'm okay. I'm safe. Um

1771
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:51,340
What was I saying?

1772
02:22:51,340 --> 02:22:53,340
um, we're just going to

1773
02:22:53,420 --> 02:22:59,580
Continue the dragonborn quest line at the moment because we are trying to freaking get the

1774
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:02,300
Uh

1775
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:05,820
Why are you attacking me? I didn't do anything

1776
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:09,900
Well, you started it. I'm me. Um, I'ma end it

1777
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:14,620
I love how fast like they fall back

1778
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:19,260
So, no, no, don't don't try and escape. You started it

1779
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:24,140
You uh, right. I'm not actually needing to fight here. We'll just go skip ahead

1780
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:29,020
It said it's already failed wait because I moved away

1781
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:35,180

02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:45,020
You can't fast travel while there's oh, you know what this game's such a troll sometimes

1784
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:51,820
Can I like hate from them can they even see me

1785
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:57,660
Come on, I'm gonna end up activating a mud crab and then I won't be able to like fly away

1786
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:00,460
Oh

1787
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:05,820
Look they shouldn't bow now is that me from here. It's quite the distance

1788
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:10,540
So and he's like bobby bee

1789
02:24:11,340 --> 02:24:15,420
Caving in our man's breastplate with a single swing of the hammer

1790
02:24:16,940 --> 02:24:18,940
Uh, yeah

1791
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:21,500

1792
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:24,060
bobby bee

1793
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:28,380
Um to save time you're best going to the Mesterville

1794
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:31,580
Crip keep

1795
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:38,380
Just to save a few precious where the heck why right take everything else off. We're doing this quest only

1796
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:45,420
Bring you off. I literally had to teleport away and didn't be annoyed. Just how long did you expect me to keep those people distracted?

1797
02:24:45,660 --> 02:24:47,660
Why are you going in here?

1798
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:50,620
You don't

1799
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:53,180
He doesn't live in here

1800
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:11,500
Um, maybe we get some food and a cup of tea shortly

1801
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:16,700
Taking if you're up to the challenge. I've actually had no water. I've not even finished my first thing. All right, then

1802
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:19,420
Let's put that to the test

1803
02:25:19,660 --> 02:25:25,100
The group I represent has its home in the ratway beneath Riftwood the tavern called the ragged flag

1804
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:30,700
Get there in one piece and we'll see if you've really got we've finally started the quest

1805
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:33,660
Uh

1806
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:41,420
We'll go down to the flag and and then we'll take a quick pause so I can

1807
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:44,220
Peep and make some food

1808
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:49,740
Guess what I've got lasagna. That's right. I can cook

1809
02:25:50,780 --> 02:25:54,940
When I when I have like really short streams. I get so much done

1810
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:58,060
Hey, there are enemies, but they're really not that bad

1811
02:25:58,700 --> 02:26:01,100
It's a shame you even have I see use

1812
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:05,580
Stop using a sword. That's a shield. That's cheating

1813
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:08,700
You such cheater me cheater

1814
02:26:12,060 --> 02:26:15,340
Uh, I think no wait leave it out. There's skewers

1815
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:24,060
You can cook honestly, I know it probably sounds like I can't I normally just trap this to do the skewer

1816
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:26,220
Oh, I let myself on fire with a gun

1817
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:31,420
Whoa, that was supposed to deal with a rat, but I guess not

1818
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:35,660
Uh, there is a guy with fisticuffs in here

1819
02:26:38,620 --> 02:26:40,620
Peeler

1820
02:26:40,860 --> 02:26:45,420
How dare you? All right, I'll destroy those so we can get um

1821
02:26:46,380 --> 02:26:48,380
That's an alchemy table

1822
02:26:48,380 --> 02:26:49,020
Oh

1823
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:52,220
I keep doing that. I've got them on the wrong way that I used to have them

1824
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:54,700
I'm just gonna eat a lot of stuff. Don't mind me

1825
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:58,140
Okay, there we go

1826
02:26:59,580 --> 02:27:01,740
I just need a test and see what it does

1827
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:10,780
Just a random sword. There's nothing special about the sword. I'm not really sure what's that. Whoa

1828
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:15,100
Someone there

1829
02:27:15,820 --> 02:27:17,820
Ah

1830
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:26,380
I remember those guys being so tough and legendary. I don't know how you beat them so well. Look, it's okay to admit

1831
02:27:27,180 --> 02:27:30,300
It's okay. Just I'm just so mlg pro

1832
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:37,900
Just eat 50 lb's of food to regain your HP literally right where the ragged full on again. He had

1833
02:27:38,780 --> 02:27:41,340
Ragged on his fun again. That's the best I got

1834
02:27:41,340 --> 02:27:43,340
Those days are over

1835
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:45,580
Well, well look at the fit

1836
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:52,460
I wasn't certain whenever you guys call me last. This is who I hear in my head when you're like, yes last

1837
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:55,340
Getting here was easy

1838
02:27:55,980 --> 02:27:57,980
Reliable and headstrong

1839
02:27:58,300 --> 02:28:03,100
You're turning out to be quite the prize. So I'm a prize. Now that I've whetted your appetite

1840
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:05,100
Refilling your price

1841
02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:07,900
About handling a few dead beats for me

1842
02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:14,540
Dead beat our organization some Syrian. I want you to explain sounds good

1843
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:18,620
Do this, right? So we're basically going on a beat them up quest

1844
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:21,660
I don't good

1845
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:25,980
We're literally going to go beat them up for thingy. Um

1846
02:28:27,580 --> 02:28:33,020
We can get back faster at least but we don't have access to the the secret ending yet

1847
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:36,940
Stop you're the prize. No you

1848
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:43,660
If we're the prize, how come we're the ones who won you you won me like that state wait

1849
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:47,100
I'm going crazy. Have I ever been here before?

1850
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:55,420
Hold on oh my god, you're cheese in it. Yes, I'm cheese in it

1851
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:03,180
Maybe sensitive

1852
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:10,860
Ah

1853
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:15,820
What is this

1854
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:22,380
What am I going wait? Oh, it's the drop down

1855
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:27,260
Goodness goodness sake. I've never actually opened that door in my life

1856
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:32,380
The drop down. Why was that? Why would there even be a gun? Oh

1857
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:33,740
Oh

1858
02:29:33,740 --> 02:29:37,900
You can speed run this area by unlocking that gate and going that way

1859
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:41,020
Oh my god, I'm learning

1860
02:29:41,660 --> 02:29:46,300
What do you mean playing the same game over and over again yields you different results

1861
02:29:48,540 --> 02:29:51,100
My fine water skills like an elephant

1862
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:53,740
Be nice to my

1863
02:29:53,740 --> 02:29:59,340
None right. We're going to go beat up some random citizens. It's not very nice, but

1864

hand-in-hand with the thieves girl and she oh also if you ever need arrows for free literally

2052
02:50:34,660 --> 02:50:40,620
who actually do hydrate for those of us who forget to hydrate you're just feeling a little

2053
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:50,100
bit tired because we need some food in the system good for the boys bad for the joy where she's

2054
02:50:50,100 --> 02:50:58,900
upstairs what's your problem yeah what's your problem hello maven bright where is that confidence

02:50:58,900 --> 02:51:06,380
I hear is that aren't against strange I'm often that confused yeah yeah yeah yeah right she's gonna

2056
02:51:06,380 --> 02:51:17,540
tell us to go do a quest where we manipulate and a competitor to her brewery and which is quite

2057
02:51:17,540 --> 02:51:24,980
a unique one because of what goes on inside the quest quick question is our way to get into the

2058
02:51:24,980 --> 02:51:32,020
these girl treasury not that I know of and other than doing the quest line where it opens up and

2059
02:51:32,020 --> 02:51:43,820
then it reveals and then it were the big root wait what oh it's been reefing seed for honestly

2060
02:51:43,820 --> 02:51:58,700
should I call a break should we do it wait hold on me let me finish my war oh that was

2061
02:51:58,700 --> 02:52:04,540
top water yeah I don't really find a top war yeah when I have it in tea I guess it covers up all

2062
02:52:04,540 --> 02:52:12,780
the flavor I work with my mother to sell first time vegetable that anyone are you okay I know it's

2063
02:52:12,780 --> 02:52:16,100
scary I know it's scary to go into a new place for the first time but you'll be all right hand

2064
02:52:16,100 --> 02:52:28,180
the new buddy oh my gosh I love it I love this game so much I'm a hello hello hello

2065
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:36,380
can't a man drink in peace geez you looks his eyes are gone like I shadow on I'm gonna keep this

2066
02:52:37,340 --> 02:52:45,660
owner so we're to basically poison the bat from a meadery in order to get this guy arrested

2067
02:52:45,660 --> 02:52:55,420
it's pretty pretty yeah it's pretty deep plot I have to admit the plot is so deep like it's

2068
02:52:55,420 --> 02:53:07,180
probably I'd say an average of five inches deep of this plot and I will make a tea and get some

2069
02:53:07,180 --> 02:53:10,180
food in me because I think I'm starting to go slightly delirious because I've not had anything

2070
02:53:10,180 --> 02:53:15,660
I'm supposed to be holding a tasting at the new hunting so if he sees the meadery in this state

2071
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:25,020
there's currently skevers and at his meteorite and we're gonna offer well that's not how I operate

2072
02:53:25,500 --> 02:53:34,300
you better or I'll yell skeever okay okay no need to make rash decisions here's half my only demand

2073
02:53:34,300 --> 02:53:41,100
is that these are permanent so he is literally handing us the poison that we're gonna poison

2074
02:53:41,100 --> 02:53:51,580
the bat of mead with it's it's it's so evil I love it please eat get that nutrition you

2075
02:53:52,460 --> 02:54:01,580
I just get so distracted when I stream like I don't oh fucking hell um I just uh oh sorry sorry

2076
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:09,100
um it's all about pear shaped hasn't it uh yeah I just like kind of forget to eat and stuff when I

2077
02:54:09,100 --> 02:54:14,220
stream I just get so distracted because it's like such a good time I've always been like oh my gosh

2078
02:54:14,220 --> 02:54:27,500
oh all right oh this is things beating me up I'm literally like I'm on the red oh you can't even

2079
02:54:27,500 --> 02:54:33,980
see my health bar oh wow my health bar is really bad right now uh I'll show you how bad it is I can

2080
02:54:33,980 --> 02:54:40,780
I can heal right now that's how bad it oh maybe I need to adjust my chat so it doesn't go over the

2081
02:54:40,860 --> 02:54:47,740
screen especially for video games like this I might get that change

2082
02:54:50,380 --> 02:54:56,460
uh speaking the honeybrew mead with emmy needs honestly emmy needs delightfully

2083
02:54:57,340 --> 02:55:03,100
emmy would cry for him it's not bad you're no hit legendary um

2084
02:55:07,420 --> 02:55:09,660
hold on Lydia you Lydia

2085
02:55:11,900 --> 02:55:18,060
Lydia you literally went around the way what do you mean by over the screen so you see how like

2086
02:55:18,060 --> 02:55:24,620
next to me is that little cuttlefish to my to your left I guess from your paw see how the chat is

2087
02:55:24,620 --> 02:55:30,060
like going up on screen from that chat box I might change it so it doesn't so the video game isn't

2088
02:55:30,780 --> 02:55:35,420
like encroached in any way because I just noticed now that you can't see my health bar

2089
02:55:36,140 --> 02:55:43,580
um you can see my stamina constantly but my big hairs oh oh sorry there's traps sorry sorry oh

2090
02:55:43,580 --> 02:55:49,660
sorry sorry oh oh Lydia Lydia there's traps like did you not just hear me jump over them Lydia

2091
02:55:49,980 --> 02:55:58,860
oh right this fight always scares me because this guy is actually super OP for no reason

2092
02:55:58,860 --> 02:56:05,020
there's a man in here oh we need to we need to get him first because I have like no magic oh

2093
02:56:05,020 --> 02:56:13,820
bruv bruv hold on all right I'll get the rats first he is like so strong for no reason and

2094
02:56:13,820 --> 02:56:18,780
he freaking does that where he fucking backs off I hate when you back off when you're fighting them

2095
02:56:18,860 --> 02:56:24,140
like I know that's normal to back off when someone's like coming at you but like it's so annoying just

2096
02:56:24,140 --> 02:56:29,100
stand still and let me parachute it's like not that big a deal yeah so that man was currently

2097
02:56:29,100 --> 02:56:37,180
living with the the skevers um you know as long as he's happy and thriving that's the main thing but

2098
02:56:40,940 --> 02:56:45,340
no a little to the right no no a little to the left a bit more

2099
02:56:46,300 --> 02:56:48,140
no a little bit more to the left

2100
02:56:51,580 --> 02:56:54,620
he's a mage yeah we hate mages honestly there's so annoying

2101
02:56:58,060 --> 02:57:05,420
male version of imme oh I mean ow I keep getting wrecked by these traps like I've like forgotten them

2102
02:57:05,420 --> 02:57:11,260
all right we'll finish this quest and then I will get some food in me because I'm probably moments

2103
02:57:11,340 --> 02:57:17,180
from perishing uh you can just grab this key back here by the way super easy um I totally

2104
02:57:17,180 --> 02:57:21,980
didn't know that on my first playthrough and walked all the way back uh like a dumb dumb

2105
02:57:23,020 --> 02:57:27,820
I don't want to steal from it it's honestly kind of picking up stolen items is really annoying

2106
02:57:27,820 --> 02:57:34,140
if the guards end up picking you up right we've done it we've done the quest once we finish we'll

2107
02:57:34,140 --> 02:57:40,620
take a look if you need to sample some of the finest meat in skyline that your shift hasn't even

2108
02:57:40,620 --> 02:57:48,220
started yet when I'm hello well it's about time I you'll just have to wait until after the camp

2109
02:57:48,220 --> 02:57:53,500
right we're gonna watch it all we're gonna watch it all in furl lydia go take a seat there

2114
02:58:21,260 --> 02:58:27,740
the elton ring dlc yeah we you word when it comes out we're replaying the full game again

2115
02:58:27,740 --> 02:58:34,540
and the dlc on top I have no idea how big the dlc is it's probably gonna be a week of elton ring

2116
02:58:34,540 --> 02:58:40,220
so I do apologize to anyone who hates elton ring I will probably have like a shorter stream and

2117
02:58:40,220 --> 02:58:48,540
maybe do like a membership stream as well and switch it up maybe she doesn't like to be told

2118
02:58:48,620 --> 02:58:51,500
sit she's not a good girl bad girl

2119
02:58:58,460 --> 02:59:09,180
actually well I'm here can we maybe just turn the music down a tiny bit yeah it's a bit overwhelming

2120
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:16,300
like in fates and stuff this is not what it seems butt bouncing are we actually doing butt bouncing

2121
02:59:16,300 --> 02:59:22,460
I don't know have you done it I feel like I want to like race to get us to do the dlc I don't

2122
02:59:22,460 --> 02:59:28,460
I assume you get the dlc once you've finished the game slamming away through the lines in between

03:03:29,820 --> 03:03:36,300
uh I need to talk to brine off again hi brine off I can't believe gullum eyes mixed up in all

2156
03:03:36,380 --> 03:03:39,420
gullum eye not to be confused with golem a

2157
03:03:40,700 --> 03:03:44,780
don't get me wrong you could scam a beggar how about I recite the work even more

2158
03:03:46,540 --> 03:03:51,980
I reduce the work even more and chew it for me do you know that's how um used to food

2159
03:03:51,980 --> 03:03:57,340
babies back in the day um it's actually really common for the moms to chew the food and then

2160
03:03:57,420 --> 03:03:59,340
give it to the um

2161
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:09,580
um yeah so like before baby formula was a thing and like solid food training or whatever like

2162
03:04:09,580 --> 03:04:15,020
before the kind of capitalism market kind of exploded went until you hear about what nesli did um

2163
03:04:16,700 --> 03:04:20,780
yeah it was like really common your mom chews the food for you and then gives it to you in your

2164
03:04:20,780 --> 03:04:24,780
mouth it's like a little baby birth moment and everyone's like that's so gross and I was like

2165
03:04:24,780 --> 03:04:30,220
bro that's the way it is that's just like how have it be you know it's very interesting I actually

2166
03:04:30,220 --> 03:04:34,620
could probably write an entire video I see about it and then present that video I say live on stream

2167
03:04:34,620 --> 03:04:39,260
and just to show everyone how natural things are but everything's been so like oh they're so weird

2168
03:04:39,260 --> 03:04:43,500
but it's only weird because we've not been exposed to it and we no longer even talk about it because

2169
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:48,140
it's like literally unironically been bred out of us over a few generations because capitalism is away

2170
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:55,340
um what one fun world scrawny did you consider getting mana as backup food

2171
03:04:57,580 --> 03:05:06,140
yeah mummy burden literally I didn't know that was a thing it is so um uh babies newborns should

2172
03:05:06,140 --> 03:05:11,660
start on breast milk because it's full of colostrum um and it's also because a baby doesn't actually

2173
03:05:11,660 --> 03:05:16,620
have an immune system until six months old um so it's very important to have breast milk however

2174
03:05:16,940 --> 03:05:22,540
it was very common to have what's called a wet nurse which is when um a woman who had recently

2175
03:05:22,540 --> 03:05:27,660
had a child would share and because it's very common for some women to experience a surplus and

2176
03:05:27,660 --> 03:05:34,620
it's very common for some women to experience problems producing milk it's just kind of random

2177
03:05:34,620 --> 03:05:39,100
doesn't really there's a lot of factors that come into play um obviously stress is a major one

2178
03:05:39,100 --> 03:05:45,660
stress on any human body for a long period do you mind I'm telling you a story about titty milk

2179
03:05:46,860 --> 03:05:52,700
leave me alone um but yes I'm sure as a lot of you can imagine being stressed for a very long

2180
03:05:52,700 --> 03:06:01,020
time is very bad for your health um guys uh guys uh stress manifests in a lot of mental health issues

2181
03:06:01,020 --> 03:06:12,220
and a lot of loneliness um oh are we gonna make it you know what we're gonna send it send it right

2182
03:06:12,220 --> 03:06:16,540
hold on hold on let them fake them out a little fake them out fake them out fake them out it's fine

2183
03:06:17,820 --> 03:06:25,580
wow wait wrong one oh shit I'm out of stamina and he's like right next to me this is rather

2184
03:06:25,580 --> 03:06:31,740
embarrassing I have to admit uh I didn't really think this far through yeah stress got me pretty good

2185
03:06:31,740 --> 03:06:37,820
yeah I like it here because I learned so much information okay there we go we can get away

2186
03:06:38,780 --> 03:06:44,620
we're I hear it I don't see it I think that's good that I don't see it though because it means

2187
03:06:44,620 --> 03:06:50,220
it's not near me don't call me out like that yeah it's very um interest in the way it physically

2188
03:06:50,220 --> 03:06:54,700
manifests in the way like obviously I think the majority of us have been like raised in a western

2189
03:06:54,700 --> 03:07:00,060
society which obviously comes with a lot of socialization and socialization plays so much

2190
03:07:00,060 --> 03:07:06,620
into the how you can deal with stress factors and like it's just kind of a sad fact that like

2191
03:07:06,700 --> 03:07:13,020
homeboys uh kind of get told to suck it up um like I can literally go green to the girls right now

2192
03:07:13,020 --> 03:07:18,380
and it's like nothing's wrong with it or anything um but it's very interesting how you tackle it I

2193
03:07:18,380 --> 03:07:22,860
don't even know how you tackle it I wouldn't even have a clue where you start like the only thing I

2194
03:07:22,860 --> 03:07:29,340
guess you could hope for is pockets of communities and overtime ideas get popular like um when the

2195
03:07:29,340 --> 03:07:35,260
general consensus of society changes that's when the real change comes through but the problem is

2196
03:07:35,260 --> 03:07:41,340
you have to basically go out with the old and how do you go out with the old well the old passes

2197
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:48,780
away the old doesn't bring down bring down the old doesn't pass on its teachings like for example um

2198
03:07:49,660 --> 03:07:55,740
I like my grandparents talked about how they got hit by their parents and it was very common

2199
03:07:55,740 --> 03:08:00,860
place to be hit if you didn't know it's actually illegal to punish your child via a corporal

2200
03:08:00,860 --> 03:08:06,460
punishment yes your own child in Scotland is legal and you will be prosecuted for hitting them no it

2201
03:08:06,460 --> 03:08:12,300
is not punishment no it is not spanking no it is literally against the law you're welcome to go up and

2202
03:08:12,300 --> 03:08:22,540
it's very bad for the child there's a lot of things done around it um but it's very fascinating um how

2203
03:08:22,540 --> 03:08:26,860
quickly things can change within a generation so my grandparents told me stories about them

2204
03:08:26,860 --> 03:08:33,740
getting hit by their parents they did not hit my parents like they didn't hit mom and dad and then

2205
03:08:33,740 --> 03:08:41,580
you know opposites I didn't hit mom and dad and mom or dad so my mom spanked me so my dad never

2206
03:08:41,580 --> 03:08:46,140
hit me he doesn't like it he doesn't believe in it and he absolutely despises it my mom

2207
03:08:48,380 --> 03:08:53,260
so there was this orange slipper and she used to hit me with it all the time because it's such a

2208
03:08:53,660 --> 03:09:04,700
child um but it's very interesting because um within a couple of generations in Scotland

2209
03:09:05,260 --> 03:09:11,260
it's a big no no to discipline your children via punishment like that physical punishment um and

2210
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:15,820
it's just like interesting to see as the generations come and go like some people might not like the

2211
03:09:15,820 --> 03:09:21,500
emphasis like oh if you're in this age range you're gen X if you're in this you're a zoomer you're this

2212
03:09:21,580 --> 03:09:29,260
you're that but the reason it is so purposeful and so important to have these names for generations

2213
03:09:29,260 --> 03:09:40,140
is because there's also a lot of societal behaviors that emerge I hear Ninroop I hear it yes um and

2214
03:09:41,180 --> 03:09:48,220
uh so like you who are listening to me right now odds are we were not raised in the exact same

2215
03:09:48,220 --> 03:09:57,340
society with the expectations and whatever's however we are crazy enough to have the ability

2216
03:09:57,340 --> 03:10:06,620
to set up a community like mind where we might agree on how things like should go and how things

2217
03:10:06,620 --> 03:10:18,540
shouldn't go and we have created a pocket a pocket of a collective that can provide secondary

2218
03:10:18,540 --> 03:10:25,100
socialization which is crazy because primary socialization is your parents but secondary is

2219
03:10:25,100 --> 03:10:30,540
like outside outside influence and I could influence you to see the world differently

2220
03:10:30,540 --> 03:10:36,940
through my words which is like insane um even we might not even be in the same generation and it's

2221
03:10:36,940 --> 03:10:42,140
just as freaking socialization is fantastic stuff I will also probably write a massive stream essay

2222
03:10:42,140 --> 03:10:47,340
I would love to talk about all this stuff in higher detail but right now we're about to do the thieves

2223
03:10:47,340 --> 03:10:53,340
quest and I've forgotten again to get food but that's okay we're just gonna sneak on in

2262
03:25:18,620 --> 03:25:24,780
i'm not i don't actually i think that hands are the average size for a waman i thought i'm

2263
03:25:24,780 --> 03:25:31,020
being funny i actually thought i was like bang on average for everything but i guess i'm not and

2264
03:25:31,020 --> 03:25:38,460
i'm actually on the smaller side they are tiny okay like when i got the ruler oh sorry i just

2265
03:25:38,460 --> 03:25:42,460
punched the microphone uh when i got the ruler i thought that was really fun because everyone can

2266
03:25:42,460 --> 03:25:49,900
kind of um wasd is natural hand position yeah i definitely agree with that

2267
03:25:55,740 --> 03:26:00,540
god you have no idea how badly i want to hold my hands i should come to our convention then

2268
03:26:01,820 --> 03:26:06,700
i have uh i'll get a bodyguard just you know just to make sure everything's all above ground

2269
03:26:06,700 --> 03:26:13,500
um but yeah like i can bring like all them things i don't know i feel like if someone

2270
03:26:13,500 --> 03:26:18,860
comes to a convention to come see you like i like the idol meetings like the japanese idol

2271
03:26:18,860 --> 03:26:22,620
meetings where they like hold your hand and you can like talk and look at each other like over

2272
03:26:22,620 --> 03:26:27,900
the table type thing i think that's really sweet and cute but i don't know i don't know it just seems

2273
03:26:27,900 --> 03:26:38,780
like something i don't know that's just me the asmr booth if only i wish a convention would

2274
03:26:38,780 --> 03:26:48,220
entertain me to do that that's honestly ridiculous make sure everything's above the table honestly

2275
03:26:50,060 --> 03:26:53,340
who would get in trouble first me or you me or are we fun

2276
03:26:58,860 --> 03:27:05,420
let me analyze this one hey stroney is there any chance for hypnosis with helping the listener

2277
03:27:05,420 --> 03:27:12,140
with addiction or focusing desires upon yourself from distractions um

2278
03:27:14,700 --> 03:27:21,180
oh i'm not sure i can do stuff like that mine is always of an alternative nature for

2279
03:27:21,980 --> 03:27:33,820
grat of the defying nature um i absolutely am not qualified or capable or doing anything that

2280
03:27:34,300 --> 03:27:41,820
um kind of has like a i don't know what the word is but like i

2281
03:27:44,220 --> 03:27:49,980
therapeutic yeah i would say there is any therapeutic hypnosis i can't participate in

2282
03:27:49,980 --> 03:27:57,180
because i don't actually have the knowledge on how who goes there how to do it safely so uh

2283
03:27:57,180 --> 03:28:03,820
safety first i will admit this is out of my league i am definitely not there and i don't

2284
03:28:03,820 --> 03:28:09,420
think i ever will be there um 10 out of 10 i know 10 holy moly oh yeah oh did you forget when i eat

2285
03:28:09,420 --> 03:28:14,540

2294
03:29:03,500 --> 03:29:07,500

2313
03:31:15,180 --> 03:31:21,580
characters from the two whole series however they have developed a bit of a cult following

2314
03:31:21,580 --> 03:31:25,580
due to memes and such and ended up with people making their own similar plushies like the

2395
03:40:34,300 --> 03:40:40,140
having a flavor for it one issue i have that i become

2396
03:40:42,780 --> 03:40:48,300
hysterical i can't read that um uh

2397
03:40:53,580 --> 03:40:55,820

2402
03:41:19,660 --> 03:41:26,220
for you i'm devoted to you i really want to send you something but i haven't had the inspiration

2403
03:41:26,220 --> 03:41:32,780
been really in my my emotions lately and it's really slammed my libido do i know a sad fact

2404
03:41:32,780 --> 03:41:40,220
my alternative picture is the last time rip in the chat i've been so freaking stressed

2405
03:41:40,220 --> 03:41:48,700
like all the time and i can't like unstress myself i think it'll calm down like once the

2406
03:41:48,780 --> 03:41:52,700
things settle but like i'm so freaking stressed and it's such a shame

2407
03:42:00,220 --> 03:42:06,780
but i'm sure i will get inspiration soon tm i think maybe i'll tell you what i think maybe

2408
03:42:06,780 --> 03:42:12,860
once the monetization for everyone has been achieved i'll start to feel relaxed because like then

2409
03:42:12,860 --> 03:42:17,020
truly is up to the girls whatever they want to do and i can just get fun shorts ordered of them

2410
03:42:17,740 --> 03:42:23,100
but like right now i'm like oh my god there's four out of six why is the other two not come

2411
03:42:23,100 --> 03:42:26,940
through because we applied for them all at the same time like oh no weapons if one of the girls

2412
03:42:26,940 --> 03:42:31,980
don't get youtube monetization oh no that that's like a whole month and uh just like oh i don't

2413
03:42:31,980 --> 03:42:36,380
oh i would be sick if i think about it we pretend we do not see

2414
03:42:36,380 --> 03:42:48,700
but yeah the the what did i say there's a line of volunteers is extremely long thank

2415
03:42:49,740 --> 03:42:51,580
yeah you guys want to make gentry right now

2416
03:42:58,460 --> 03:43:03,820
i've almost finished eating and then i will slurp my honey tea and then we'll get back into the

2417
03:43:03,820 --> 03:43:14,620
thieves guild

2418
03:43:16,540 --> 03:43:24,460
skyrim's going good we're at um golem from the thieves guild quest we're about to be

2419
03:43:25,260 --> 03:43:32,060
meeting the big naughty on who's trying to take down the thieves guild soon tm and um

2420
03:43:32,940 --> 03:43:39,260
once we do the thieves guild we are going to do the dark brotherhood because i actually really

2421
03:43:39,260 --> 03:43:44,940
enjoy it it's quite i think i think the dark brotherhood is actually relatively quick um

2422
03:43:46,860 --> 03:43:50,540
and then we're going to do the vampires and then if we still have time we're going to do

2423
03:43:51,420 --> 03:43:58,620
um the actual dragonborn quest line which i hate doing because it breaks the game and

2424
03:43:58,700 --> 03:44:03,180
then if you ever like seriously want to do like a hundred percent speed run it's speed

2425
03:44:03,180 --> 03:44:06,860
runs not speed run just a hundred percent achievements always leave it last because

2426
03:44:06,860 --> 03:44:13,980
it breaks the game so much when you have to like say like oh we'll give white run up or we'll give

2427
03:44:13,980 --> 03:44:20,460
this uh rifting off or we'll do this or we'll do that every day feel as how much it breaks the game

2428
03:44:20,460 --> 03:44:32,460
but i finished my my bowl of lasagna um now i've got my my cup of tea and my cola i do i do

2429
03:44:32,460 --> 03:44:38,300
i've got my cola no need to read this during a stream oh yeah what happens if i do it right now

2430
03:44:39,260 --> 03:44:44,460

2431
03:44:45,020 --> 03:44:47,020

2432
03:44:54,780 --> 03:44:59,500
oh whoa someone is giving me a step by step

2433
03:45:01,260 --> 03:45:05,500
gate on how to do haptic feedback

2434
03:45:05,500 --> 03:45:16,060
penalize penalizing okay that's the law links um how down bad do you think is too down bad for

2435
03:45:16,060 --> 03:45:26,220
you for me oh no i like i like main corruption so there's not really a down too bad i think

2436
03:45:26,220 --> 03:45:32,860
corruption's really um up there um oh my first membership stream can be about that

2437
03:45:33,100 --> 03:45:35,980
uh no about ranking everything

2438
03:45:41,980 --> 03:45:43,740
penalize yes

2444
03:46:17,580 --> 03:46:24,780
audios up um it is spaced out for the other girls so because all the audios were uploaded on the first

2445
03:46:24,780 --> 03:46:30,220
that did mean there's a bit of a break between the next one that comes up but as it stands everyone

2446
03:46:30,220 --> 03:46:44,540
has a day if i can remember correctly azura monday mersey tuesday um emmy wednesday sheby thursday

2447
03:46:44,540 --> 03:46:58,140
i see friday strongy saturday i'm not quite sure but just so you understand they are purposefully

2448
03:46:58,140 --> 03:47:10,780
spaced out who goes there um and um they will be like every tuesday all of x's will go out on

2449
03:47:10,780 --> 03:47:15,660
every tuesday all of like for me every saturday an audio will come out like that kind of thing

2450
03:47:15,660 --> 03:47:23,180
um we i'm going to get the girls to post on what's inside like with the tags and everything

2451
03:47:23,820 --> 03:47:31,020
i just need catch up time um she says as she's sitting on skyrim for an endurance stream

2452
03:47:31,020 --> 03:47:36,140
i've got nothing but the cheek i really do i've got nothing but the cheek but i do need catch up

2453
03:47:36,140 --> 03:47:44,700
time to get into the flow of things then next month um 100 will be like you will see what's

2454
03:47:44,700 --> 03:47:50,620
inside if you want to subscribe for that month or not and if not then you know you can take a look

2455
03:47:50,620 --> 03:47:56,060
at whoever else is posting maybe they've got something a bit more up to your style again i would

2456
03:47:56,060 --> 03:48:03,420
like to repeat when it comes to the audios i have not shoehorned anyone into the same type of plot

2457
03:48:03,500 --> 03:48:09,260
if you will because that will not financially enable them to be the content creator they'd

2458
03:48:09,260 --> 03:48:14,380
like to be um a lot of the girls are looking at moving out possibly if they're able to receive

2459
03:48:14,380 --> 03:48:19,500
enough support so that's why i do say if you only have enough money to support one girl please do

2460
03:48:19,500 --> 03:48:28,860
pick a daughter of mine because um they are gunning to move out um and it means they would

2461
03:48:28,860 --> 03:48:39,900
provide more content and yeah it's just a very positive cycle occurs um yes uh yeah i'm both

2462
03:48:39,900 --> 03:48:46,220
meanies like not bad to kill it by emoji if you subscribe to everyone you get an audio every day

2463
03:48:46,220 --> 03:48:51,740
i mean technically you're very close you get a rest day no one uploads on a sunday

2464
03:48:52,140 --> 03:48:59,180
also they deserve it yes the girls work incredibly hard um ac was like am i allowed

2465
03:48:59,180 --> 03:49:04,140
someone asked a question to ac on marshmallow like uh how do your recordings work and she was

2466
03:49:04,140 --> 03:49:09,100
like am i allowed to talk about this and i'm like yeah you can as long as you don't see anything

2467
03:49:09,100 --> 03:49:15,100
that's like nda obvious then yeah you can talk about how i i burst into your dms and hand you a

2468
03:49:15,100 --> 03:49:20,140
script and all the spelling is wrong and the grammar's whack yeah you can talk about that all

2469
03:49:20,140 --> 03:49:32,460
you like i say actual day of rest honestly um but yes thank you for thanking me for giving the girls

2470
03:49:32,460 --> 03:49:38,860
a home but please understand the girls did it themselves they reached out to vealer they applied

2471
03:49:38,860 --> 03:49:43,980
um they went to an interview and they were happy with everything some of them did the very thorough

2472
03:49:43,980 --> 03:49:51,180
research uh emi actually was the most inquisitive and had the most questions azura i think she was

2473
03:49:51,180 --> 03:49:56,220
just like is any of this real i think she thought she was dreaming because she never asked a single

2474
03:49:56,220 --> 03:50:04,220
question after the interview um yeah azura was absolutely adorable emi asked a ton of questions

2475
03:50:04,220 --> 03:50:08,780
which made me think she wasn't actually gonna accept the character because i told her what the

2476
03:50:08,780 --> 03:50:16,540
character theme was and i saw people were being weird but yeah azura was like fuck it we ball

2477
03:50:16,540 --> 03:50:23,500
indian and docs and notwithstanding they have carte blanche what carte blanche

2478
03:50:24,300 --> 03:50:33,820
but what uh in english what in english english that's so azura honestly yeah that sounds like

2479
03:50:34,780 --> 03:50:44,380
big mommy we ball honestly a free pass or it means like free reign oh carte blanche a blank

2480
03:50:44,940 --> 03:50:52,700
menu is what the translation is that makes sense a free pass a blank menu oh my god i can't believe

2481
03:50:52,700 --> 03:51:02,300
it sorry i translated it literally versus uh metaphor good uh hi sending messages scares me

2482
03:51:02,380 --> 03:51:06,060
but i want i watched your ASMR stream and it was amazing i can't wait to see more of your

2483
03:51:06,060 --> 03:51:11,900

2484
03:51:11,900 --> 03:51:17,900
making ASMR making via lure has me thinking i should start and follow my own you should follow

2485
03:51:17,900 --> 03:51:22,540
your own dreams you've only got one shot i keep snail blinking please paul please don't notice me

2486
03:51:22,540 --> 03:51:27,020
snail blinking you do you've only got one shot if you've got a dream or something you want to achieve

2487
03:51:27,660 --> 03:51:32,300
where can go for it like if i win the lottery already know what i'm doing all i'm saying is if

2488
03:51:32,300 --> 03:51:40,220
i win the lottery the girls are getting stacked out so i'm saying um you know the split going even

2489
03:51:40,220 --> 03:51:46,460
higher you know oh it's always fun to try and reach for a new goal like for example hypnosis

2490
03:51:46,460 --> 03:51:50,780
is my new goal i've always enjoyed it and always liked it but i've never made it myself because

2491
03:51:50,780 --> 03:51:55,180
like i'm just like not skilled and i need to make sure it's safe and all that sorry i'm trying

2492
03:51:55,180 --> 03:52:01,180
there's a fucking cat hair on my face and it's one of those cat hairs where you wipe it away and

2493
03:52:01,180 --> 03:52:05,740
then it does a 360 look back on wherever it's freaking a caption i'm so sorry

2494
03:52:08,620 --> 03:52:15,900
that'll be gimley honestly um but you honestly you placed everyone in their spots so well i

2495
03:52:15,900 --> 03:52:21,660
wouldn't picture anyone else yes there is right no i'm not gonna say it because i might start up

2496
03:52:21,660 --> 03:52:28,380
some shitters um and we ain't stirring the pot from these parts we tap the sign from these parts um

2497
03:52:29,260 --> 03:52:39,340
let's see hi strony could you give us a hearing test like hearing test asmr of course i can do

2498
03:52:39,340 --> 03:52:49,340
something like that for ya you do a 360 and walk away wait a minute a 180 oops wait no 360 is the

2499
03:52:49,340 --> 03:52:56,460
circle 180 is the opposite right okay um i could absolutely do a hearing test i did a

2500
03:52:56,460 --> 03:53:02,940
ear cleaning where i'm like muffled until as the audio progresses i'm less muffled

2501
03:53:02,940 --> 03:53:06,540
i thought it was pretty cool i need to edit it actually it might be one of my one and four

2502
03:53:06,540 --> 03:53:12,860
because i i owe you four this whole skyrim stream actually kind of went perfect because tomorrow i will

2503
03:53:13,420 --> 03:53:19,500
do my monetization celebration stream where everyone can absolutely laugh and i'm pretty sure

2504
03:53:19,500 --> 03:53:24,060
someone's probably already guessed what i've got planned for it there's no way after yesterday's

2505
03:53:24,060 --> 03:53:28,700
stream someone hasn't put two and two together and knows why i got a pedicure in particular

2506
03:53:29,580 --> 03:53:36,940
i refuse i refuse she fell for the oldest these xbox joke honestly do a 540 believe it

2507
03:53:37,900 --> 03:53:44,060
um my body prevented me from my dream so i come about have you ever had an actual medical

2508
03:53:44,060 --> 03:53:51,180
ear cleaning i've not had a medical ear cleaning but i did get my hearing checked as a child um

2509
03:53:51,180 --> 03:53:57,740
because i was ignoring my mum where i was undiagnosed it was my idea actually um

2510
03:54:00,380 --> 03:54:02,780
i'm going to sip my tea before it gets too cold okay

2511
03:54:03,740 --> 03:54:12,140
eh yeah my mum got me uh sent to a hearing test because she was sitting at my dad she was like

2512
03:54:12,140 --> 03:54:17,580
strony doesn't he listen to me like strony strony never hears me and i used to do this thing

2513
03:54:17,580 --> 03:54:23,740
where i sat right in front of the tv so the tv was on a stand but i would sit directly under it so

2514
03:54:23,740 --> 03:54:28,780
my neck was looking directly upward sorry i just hit the mic there by uh i know you can't see my

2515
03:54:28,780 --> 03:54:35,100
hands but my mic was at my mic my neck was directly upwards looking at the tv like pure pure

2516
03:54:35,100 --> 03:54:41,740
in a trance like straight up like tizm a doctor walked in and tizm was the diagnosis type thing

2517
03:54:42,380 --> 03:54:48,380
and obviously my mum didn't know what it was all about at the time so i got sent for a hearing test

2518
03:54:48,380 --> 03:54:54,700
and she was like the wife that did the hearing test on me she was like oh no pet you're hearing

2519
03:54:54,700 --> 03:55:01,660
spain i don't know what's going on with you um and yeah basically that was that's when the

2520
03:55:01,660 --> 03:55:08,220
signs start to show and then now here i am someone who has to read and write for a living and goodness

2521
03:55:08,220 --> 03:55:15,580
gravey is it freaking hard i'm slurping is she okay nah she's just fucking hella autistic

2522
03:55:15,580 --> 03:55:25,820
a kid with autism how close were you to the tv oh i'm not being funny when i'm like i was directly

2523
03:55:25,820 --> 03:55:34,140
below the tv i like i was sitting crisscross looking directly up at the tv and my neck was

2524
03:55:34,140 --> 03:55:44,060
up in the air like it and i and my mum ascertained that it was hearing issues rather than something

2525
03:55:44,060 --> 03:55:50,300
else maybe going on she had a case of strontism honestly the strontism's too strong

2526
03:55:53,420 --> 03:55:58,700
um that's not good for your eyes oh well i do actually need to be wearing my glicks but

2527
03:56:00,460 --> 03:56:06,060
i'm making it work okay i was right in the vtuber collab scripts and i was like this is too small

2528
03:56:06,060 --> 03:56:11,260
this text so i zoomed in and i'm like oh my god i'm gonna be a blind as a fish like really soon

2529
03:56:11,260 --> 03:56:13,900
wait that's literally me as a kid literally

2530
03:56:18,700 --> 03:56:26,540
do you reckon cuttlefish have actual autism um as an uncertified marine biologist anything is

2531
03:56:26,540 --> 03:56:31,820
possible if you didn't know down syndrome is possible in animals as well um i believe down

2532
03:56:31,820 --> 03:56:40,940
syndrome is the deletion of chrome zone oh god what is it in humans uh not 32 that's

2533
03:56:41,740 --> 03:56:45,260
not right i can't remember which deletion it is but it can happen in gorillas

2534
03:56:45,260 --> 03:56:49,740
seriously i'm not even kidding look up down some down syndrome gorilla and like it's

2535
03:56:49,740 --> 03:56:56,060
fucking creepy oh it's an extra edition of 21 sorry yeah i'm thinking of the deletion one

2536
03:56:56,060 --> 03:57:01,340
what is the deletion one called that i always watch documentaries about

2537
03:57:03,180 --> 03:57:08,860
it happens when life deletes 32 yes um actually spindle fiber failure um

2538
03:57:11,180 --> 03:57:17,180
uh which is i um i find it really interesting oh god i feel like every time i'm like i find

2539
03:57:17,180 --> 03:57:22,380
this so interesting and fascinating it leads to me rambling about something that you guys couldn't

2540
03:57:22,380 --> 03:57:28,300
give less of a shit about i feel really bad but at the same time i really like blabbing away so i'm

2541
03:57:28,300 --> 03:57:35,820
like that just do it that just tell you about um fertilization so the reason why the rate of down

2542
03:57:35,820 --> 03:57:43,500
syndrome goes up dramatically the older the woman is beyond the age of 25 yes the age of 25 um

2543
03:57:44,220 --> 03:57:50,940
you're you're already hitting the wall at 25 rip um the reason it goes up exponentially is because

2544
03:57:51,020 --> 03:57:59,660
the failure of the spindle fibers that's what pulls apart um that's what pulls it apart and then

2545
03:57:59,660 --> 03:58:06,060
results in a the an additional chromosome wiggling about which is the rise of down syndrome which is

2546
03:58:06,060 --> 03:58:15,180
why women who um are having children later in life are often advised to do what is uh referred to

2547
03:58:16,140 --> 03:58:22,940
as a DNA test which i've completely forgotten the name of but basically they pierce the amniotic

2548
03:58:22,940 --> 03:58:29,100
sac and take a tiny cell sample of the baby and then check its DNA sequence under um you know get

2549
03:58:29,100 --> 03:58:33,020
it because to see if the child has down syndrome or not and then either they're advised would you

2550
03:58:33,020 --> 03:58:38,780
like to terminate or not or bring to term whatever type thing goes on but um it definitely is a risk

2551
03:58:38,780 --> 03:58:44,700
and uh like also being obese with the child as well results in gestational diabetes which is

2552
03:58:44,700 --> 03:58:54,540
very dangerous for the child very dangerous for the mum um there's also um if depending on the blood

2553
03:58:54,540 --> 03:59:00,780
type of the mother and the blood type of the child the mother during the entire pregnancy her body can

2554
03:59:00,780 --> 03:59:07,740
be attacking the baby until it um has a natural um abortion if you didn't know abortion is the

2555
03:59:07,740 --> 03:59:14,620
natural term but you can also get a medical abortion but abortion is the natural term for

2556
03:59:14,620 --> 03:59:19,820
it just happening and there are many reasons why it can never come to term how do you know all this

2557
03:59:19,820 --> 03:59:26,780
stuff is fascinating no i don't go to school i like watching youtube videos about um biology related

2558
03:59:26,780 --> 03:59:34,060
things i have a fascination in uh diagnoses in particular like why the reason it occurs for

2559
03:59:34,060 --> 03:59:42,780
example um like uh there's this syndrome uh of course it evades my mind i think it's called

2560
03:59:42,780 --> 03:59:49,660
like william hunter syndrome where the child or the well the child that can become an adult um

2561
03:59:49,660 --> 03:59:54,860
because you you do not pass away uh unless you have complications with other diseases for example

2562
03:59:54,860 --> 04:00:01,500
um you will never experience the sensation of being full uh you will constantly eat um there's

2563
04:00:01,500 --> 04:00:08,700
like hereditary syndromes as well like hunter syndrome which is pretty uh devastating um there's

2564
04:00:08,700 --> 04:00:15,660
interesting one such as dwarfism dwarfism can actually be passed on by two individuals who

2565
04:00:15,660 --> 04:00:26,140
visually do not have any um display of any dwarf uh ism genetics um but it is a recessive gene uh

2566
04:00:26,140 --> 04:00:30,380
and if the two people come together um yep you can have it how do you know all this

2567
04:00:30,380 --> 04:00:36,540
reefling that obviously has not got the autism angel man syndrome is that angel man syndrome

2568
04:00:37,660 --> 04:00:46,620
is that the one where the child is locked in the child like say i believe so mentally they

2569
04:00:46,620 --> 04:00:55,740
can't develop any further um uh yes uh Harley Quinn syndrome um doesn't sound like what it is

2570
04:00:55,820 --> 04:01:01,260
it's where your skin constantly your skin regenerates so fast that you flake and you break and it's

2571
04:01:01,260 --> 04:01:08,140
just absolute it is a living heck for those poor uh like children that are born but you can make it

2572
04:01:08,140 --> 04:01:16,060
to adulthood um there's a lot of sad um diagnoses that you can get like you can get childhood

2573
04:01:16,060 --> 04:01:22,380
dementia those are quite crushing ones um stroneys institute for the gift to take

2574
04:01:22,860 --> 04:01:27,100
you up angel man is the eaten one is it Harley Quinn issues yeah

2575
04:01:28,940 --> 04:01:35,900
as door is dwarfism classified only is being short there are a redonkulous amount of dwarfism

2576
04:01:35,900 --> 04:01:43,420
classifications um some can be like no stunted growth on the abdomen uh other versions are no

2577
04:01:43,420 --> 04:01:51,660
stunted growth on the arms and the legs but the um organ holder area if you will for lack of better

2578
04:01:51,660 --> 04:01:56,860
words abdomen all that and chest and that like there's so many different classifications is quite um

2579
04:01:59,100 --> 04:02:03,580
it's quite fascinating stuff when she uh get into torso yeah torso will do just nicely

2580
04:02:03,580 --> 04:02:08,220
i remember when the photos of those babies were used as shock foot yeah unfortunately um

2581
04:02:10,220 --> 04:02:16,940
kind of if you use older like if you look up like Freud stuff for example you get quite a

2582
04:02:16,940 --> 04:02:22,220
few older photos that are like Freud Freud you didn't have to photograph that mate like you know

2583
04:02:23,260 --> 04:02:28,940
do you know about prisons yeah like the stanley prison experiment and how people play roles that

2584
04:02:28,940 --> 04:02:35,500
they perceive to be superior uh absolutely fascinating stuff i do and enjoy the psychology

2585
04:02:35,500 --> 04:02:45,740
it has to offer um i think humans and our everyday socialization were always kind of

2586
04:02:46,300 --> 04:02:53,500
it's always insinuated that there's someone to look up to but i am a big believer in the three

2587
04:02:54,540 --> 04:03:01,660
um three perspective talk and it's like parent to parent child to child adult to parent or

2588
04:03:01,660 --> 04:03:07,740
something like that and it's like the three ways you can communicate with someone he said prions

2589
04:03:07,740 --> 04:03:16,380
oh not prisons my apology i was talking about the the stanley prison experiment prions uh no a

2590
04:03:16,380 --> 04:03:21,820
little bit about prions not not not too much sorry i just read what i wanted to read prudder's

2591
04:03:21,820 --> 04:03:26,860
williams syndrome oh prudder willie syndrome that sounds like um i'll just mix them up yes

2592
04:03:26,860 --> 04:03:33,420
prions diseases are horrifying um did you know about the family of blue people from generations of

2593
04:03:34,940 --> 04:03:40,700
i know there's a family that's like on youtube because someone goes and films them

2594
04:03:40,700 --> 04:03:47,340
and they communicate via barks because they have so many issues it's such a shame

2595
04:03:48,300 --> 04:03:54,540
i want this woman to yank me for the rest of my life honestly

2596
04:03:56,620 --> 04:04:03,180
uh well that speaking of prions um what is it rabid rickin bites you what's that called

2597
04:04:04,380 --> 04:04:13,660
as soon as you develop um water phobia water phobia hydrophobic water phobia once you develop

2598
04:04:13,660 --> 04:04:20,780
hydrophobia rabies that's it once you develop hydrophobia you have a hundred percent um loss rate

2599
04:04:21,500 --> 04:04:28,460
you can't win it is it is some scary stuff and and to think that we are very lucky to avoid this

2600
04:04:28,460 --> 04:04:34,300

now please don't get me wrong there still be rewards for those who can but i have purposely

2628
04:07:50,780 --> 04:07:57,820
pushed for public access rewards once goals have been met please let me try and cook it's very hard

2629
04:07:57,820 --> 04:08:07,820
to find a good balance who goes there i don't find myself um but yes i am i am trying my best to find

glasses oh that's terrible legit i thought you were talking about skyrim's azura azura

2659
04:11:15,900 --> 04:11:21,020

2660
04:11:21,020 --> 04:11:23,020
are

2661
04:11:30,780 --> 04:11:31,660

oh

2664
04:11:46,620 --> 04:11:54,300
hello oh my god i've gone way too far ahead of the plot i've gone way too far ahead of the

2665
04:11:54,300 --> 04:12:00,220
plot i've not even spoken to the guy to get him to move i was so confused why the trap door

2666
04:12:00,220 --> 04:12:07,660
wasn't open up oh azura gets you to clean out her star right you're done i'm not not you're done

2667
04:12:08,780 --> 04:12:13,580
didn't even get to the the first message i read in chat after like a couple of minutes of combat

2668
04:12:13,580 --> 04:12:22,940
that's terrible yeah azura's star is i uh thought it was on i'm literally speedrun the plot i've

2669
04:12:22,940 --> 04:12:30,140
gone like 10 leagues ahead i do apologize babel is where humanity teamed up to build a tower

2670
04:12:31,260 --> 04:12:34,460
to heaven and knocked it down and

2671
04:12:35,420 --> 04:12:41,100
um honestly it's quite interesting how

2672
04:12:43,340 --> 04:12:48,460
no i can't say that unfortunately um base i'm speedrunning the plot

2673
04:12:52,540 --> 04:12:57,020
yeah i've been playing too much binding of isaac oh my god wait have i said i'm

2674
04:12:57,020 --> 04:13:01,500
i'm like nine eight percent sure i've actually already said this but some of the girls are into

2675
04:13:01,980 --> 04:13:09,420
tarot cards they're called um and it's the funniest thing ever and the reason why it's

2676
04:13:09,420 --> 04:13:15,900
funny is my only exposure to tarot cards is the binding of isaac okay which means whenever they're

2677
04:13:15,900 --> 04:13:21,180
talking about like pool and cards or whatever they're like the tower card and i'm like yes

2678
04:13:21,180 --> 04:13:27,260
yes six bombs six bombs you can probably unlock like a secret um like a tinted rock and get like

2679
04:13:27,260 --> 04:13:32,540
a soul heart from it yes and like the lovers yes you can get two hearts if you can find a donation

2680
04:13:32,540 --> 04:13:38,060
machine maybe you can get some coins out of it i'm like oh goodness sake like all of them must be

2681
04:13:38,060 --> 04:13:45,180
rolling their eyes that my only experience like the freaking the hanged man uh oh yeah um that's

2682
04:13:45,180 --> 04:13:52,300
fantastic i can uh i can fly in the room like position or the full card oh yeah it takes me

2683
04:13:52,300 --> 04:13:57,660
back to the starting of the the map oh that's amazing that's amazing uh hey i'm just gonna

2684
04:13:57,660 --> 04:14:04,380
skip this part because i don't really need to see it um can you speak a little bit about your

2685
04:14:04,380 --> 04:14:09,260
plans for membership no bother you shoot before but you're honestly worth it oh my god stop you're

2686
04:14:09,260 --> 04:14:17,740
gonna make me blush um i will most likely do two memberships uh streams a week um most likely a

2687
04:14:17,740 --> 04:14:23,340
Samar membership is probably the most requested i also like doing watch alongs um some stream

2688
04:14:23,340 --> 04:14:33,180
snipe games uh maybe for more close things um maybe i did maybe i i don't care what you promise

2689
04:14:33,180 --> 04:14:40,620
if i tell you the buyer's name hasn't learned you kill me well i have a body okay it looks like

2690
04:14:40,620 --> 04:14:47,820
only bribery works on him um two i mean yeah i want to make it worth your money like the way

2691
04:14:47,820 --> 04:14:55,820
i try to think of it in my head is how much do you pay for like a movie ticket for like one and a

2692
04:14:55,820 --> 04:15:02,460
half hours entertainment okay i'ma take that and then double it and then double it again so i'm like

2693
04:15:02,460 --> 04:15:09,420
okay i'll try to stream every single day i'll also try to offer membership streams at least twice a

2694
04:15:09,420 --> 04:15:14,620
week that seems fair that means in total for the membership not only do you directly support me and

2695
04:15:14,620 --> 04:15:21,020
future projects gentle and the projects the girls want to pursue soon but we can't talk about any of

2696
04:15:21,020 --> 04:15:31,660
it yet um and it means like also get like a more i suppose like a more intimate stream experience of

2697
04:15:31,660 --> 04:15:41,420
people like that um like seventeen dollars for a movie ticket that's outrageous um gen two confirmed

2698
04:15:41,420 --> 04:15:46,780
live on the stream stocks i remember the first time i did this quest i was so nervous about like

2699
04:15:46,780 --> 04:15:54,540
all the guards coming at me but they don't even care hanged man to we we hingees well you do

2700
04:15:54,540 --> 04:15:59,260
watch together streams for members i absolutely would love to do that yes we can a hundred percent

2701
04:15:59,340 --> 04:16:05,900
do that gen two spoiled live no clickbait oh you just wait until the zers don't a thumb for that

2702
04:16:08,460 --> 04:16:12,860
if you want to see one of the concepts but not all

2703
04:16:15,660 --> 04:16:20,700
i don't really talk about it in the server with the girls out of respect because of uh

2704
04:16:21,500 --> 04:16:26,700
a miscommunication on my part and honestly it's kind of easier it's much easier to go

2705
04:16:27,500 --> 04:16:31,900
you know oh shit my bad you're right then to like explain in mass detail like what the

2706
04:16:31,900 --> 04:16:35,420
most communication was you know like it is what it is

2707
04:16:37,580 --> 04:16:39,900
gen two is just she be with a different voice and a real color

2708
04:16:41,660 --> 04:16:48,860
i'm actually getting her take this a chocolate skin at some point i'm probably doing it within

2709
04:16:48,860 --> 04:16:53,900
the next one i brought in the coin and what not at all we're just skipping through the dialogue

2710
04:16:53,980 --> 04:17:01,340
that can't be our skin into this look now since our transaction is done i love the gen two memes

2711
04:17:01,340 --> 04:17:09,740
but gen one 3d though um the girls are all very interested in 3d the problem is i don't know

2712
04:17:09,740 --> 04:17:19,980
i think i'm saying about it i don't have a heart no

2713
04:17:24,540 --> 04:17:30,380
you should think about staying the night uh wait i know one of those songs but she doesn't sing it

2714
04:17:30,380 --> 04:17:36,540
it's rodrick rodrick there's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit sure what can i do for you

2715
04:17:36,940 --> 04:17:41,260
um no there once was a hero named ragnar the rest

2716
04:17:41,820 --> 04:17:46,460
who came riding to white run from old rodrick stand

2717
04:17:47,820 --> 04:17:58,460
all this ragged and ragged and brandish his blade as he told the old stories and gold that he made

2718
04:17:58,540 --> 04:18:04,380
i can't remember the rest i need the rest of it

2719
04:18:06,140 --> 04:18:14,060
it's in another end i said another end she doesn't go here right we're just gonna if you

2720
04:18:14,060 --> 04:18:18,620
want to skip this quest literally just time sink and he will teleport because it's just such a

2721
04:18:19,740 --> 04:18:24,300
whatever way you go about it you know the 3d will be lit yeah i don't have a clue like

2722
04:18:24,300 --> 04:18:30,860
they maybe had like such a gorgeous 3d model but i'm like 9 in percent sure that shitting

2723
04:18:30,860 --> 04:18:39,020
vr chat um but i don't know what it is and i'm not sure any of the girls have 3d experience

2724
04:18:39,020 --> 04:18:44,620
either to help me out the best i can do is like 3d vr chat but i don't know if that's

2725
04:18:44,620 --> 04:18:55,500
disappointing for them um i will maybe ask sin sin is vr chat i asked her and i was quite happy

2726
04:18:55,500 --> 04:19:02,140
with her model like um and i think that's like what the girls are if they're one 3d like that's all

2727
04:19:02,140 --> 04:19:09,660
of god you know um i'll be a learning experience for all vr chat streams being created with you

2728
04:19:09,660 --> 04:19:17,740
know could you imagine acs dg sessions in pure chat yeah it's it's not necessarily a lot of work

2729
04:19:17,740 --> 04:19:24,380
because i just oh you can't wait in this location dumb game we're forcing you east empire company

2730
04:19:24,380 --> 04:19:34,780
warehouse i wonder if that was by the british empire british um so this level you're supposed to

2731
04:19:34,780 --> 04:19:49,020
like lurk from the sky but yeah i need to offer the girls um what are they called all the trackers

2732
04:19:49,740 --> 04:19:55,260
but i myself don't actually know what trackers they need and i don't know what the full price

2733
04:19:55,260 --> 04:19:59,900
point is like i've been really open and honest with the girls and been like obviously once

2734
04:19:59,900 --> 04:20:04,620
everyone's monetized we can see what kind of money you're earning and if it's good it's bad

2735
04:20:04,700 --> 04:20:09,020
like because obviously if the girls money's low they're not going to want to stick around are they

2736
04:20:09,020 --> 04:20:18,700
um so i do have some kind of like mildly boosting efforts but it's not really

2737
04:20:20,780 --> 04:20:27,420
yeah you know it's kind of when you're on the managing side it's kind of like i can only do

2738
04:20:27,420 --> 04:20:32,460
so much with what the girls give me very thankfully the girls are giving me they're all like literally

2739
04:20:32,460 --> 04:20:37,900
everyone streamed every single day which was insane uh within reason of course um and like

2740
04:20:37,900 --> 04:20:44,620
they're taking it a bit more easy this week which i'm very glad to see we do almost i'm a sneak

2741
04:20:44,620 --> 04:20:53,980
increase yeah or do you think he notices me at all yeah no uh there are some really nice uh things

2742
04:20:53,980 --> 04:21:03,900
you can do in vr chat i have seen something i didn't what detected me oh oh no he's discovering all

2743
04:21:03,900 --> 04:21:07,420
the dead bodies along the way but he doesn't find that suspicious like at all

2744
04:21:11,020 --> 04:21:16,540
i don't know if my my poor heart can take stronti in 3d it would be so fun because you can see how

2745
04:21:16,540 --> 04:21:23,900
like animated at um i thought about doing a dance 3d stream where like i play music

2746
04:21:23,900 --> 04:21:28,380
that you guys suggest and like we just dance and drink and stuff i don't know is that weird

2747
04:21:39,100 --> 04:21:45,580
just a body nothing so so literally oh well mustn't be anything um i thought that would be

2748
04:21:45,660 --> 04:21:50,060
cute like rating your songs and stuff but i don't know how good the tracking is like because

2749
04:21:50,060 --> 04:21:54,460
i want i want to see my butt jiggle i won't be twerking and stuff

2750
04:21:57,180 --> 04:22:00,380
i know the year is transpiring and it's really endearing how committed you are to making sure

2751
04:22:00,380 --> 04:22:07,820
everyone eats good both the talents and fun it's right here in my favor i just uh is he gonna just

2752
04:22:08,460 --> 04:22:11,820
checked me i mean clearly just doesn't care

2753
04:22:14,620 --> 04:22:23,900
if someone go oh um 3d stronti hypnotizes you that'll be interesting like i just don't

2754
04:22:23,900 --> 04:22:30,140
know how 3d works at all i think vain or like sony notes are the default for most tracking i've seen

2755
04:22:30,140 --> 04:22:36,060
vr avatars with pendulum and spiral tall everyone just the exception

2756
04:22:43,100 --> 04:22:47,820
okay so he does a little uh jabate where he actually comes walking back which is why i'm

2757
04:22:47,820 --> 04:22:56,780
hanging back right now because he's a wee liar um but yeah 3d definitely on the cards we're just

2758
04:22:57,740 --> 04:23:04,860
obviously we're kind of in the recoup funds stage um and kind of seeing where everyone is of

2759
04:23:04,860 --> 04:23:08,620
everyone happy like i sent the girls all the message i was like is there anything i can do to

2760
04:23:08,620 --> 04:23:12,300
make your experience better like how do you feel after your first week and i got like a lot of

2761
04:23:12,300 --> 04:23:21,260
good feedback so um i'm just gonna be getting ready to get the girls shorts more consistently

2762
04:23:22,220 --> 04:23:28,940
because it's taking me a hot second to get shorts that i was hoping to at least get them

2763
04:23:28,940 --> 04:23:34,220
like two a week out right now it's like one a week oops and that's just because i suck

2764
04:23:36,140 --> 04:23:41,020
and i'm gonna fall in the water stronti but don't jiggle jiggle it falls

2765
04:23:43,100 --> 04:23:48,220
my money don't jiggle jiggle it falls i like to see you wiggle wiggle for sure

2766
04:23:48,940 --> 04:23:55,740
by the way when our membership expected to become available on tomorrow's stream um

2767
04:23:56,380 --> 04:24:04,300
i'm gonna get it all set up um and all of that so tomorrow's stream isn't gonna be skyrim

2768
04:24:04,300 --> 04:24:08,220
uh we're not gonna do full achievements because i don't know why my achievements aren't working

2769
04:24:10,140 --> 04:24:12,780
uh there are enemies all over here but you can just go swinging

2770
04:24:13,020 --> 04:24:16,940
you picked a bad time to get lost i think if

2771
04:24:21,100 --> 04:24:27,500
this is no there is a health potion stacked over there somewhere i remember correctly

2772
04:24:30,620 --> 04:24:37,100
oh i thought there was a health potion here i guess no it's just wine close enough

2773
04:24:37,980 --> 04:24:42,780
we can sell these potion of strength so there's just spiders in there i don't know if there's

2774
04:24:42,780 --> 04:24:49,020
anything else you can just go willy nilly through this it's not really um no magic i hate magic

2775
04:24:50,460 --> 04:24:55,340
i don't want to go i can literally hear that spider in that cave it's membership gonna stream

2776
04:24:55,340 --> 04:25:00,860
yeah it's tomorrow so the the skyrim part two is getting steam rolled over to make way for the

2777
04:25:00,860 --> 04:25:07,100
monetization stream and then i'm like a hundred percent sure you guys know exactly what i'm doing

2778
04:25:07,100 --> 04:25:17,100
tomorrow it's not even gonna be a surprise at this point um but just yeah this is just gonna be a

2779
04:25:17,100 --> 04:25:22,220
one-off skyrim achievement if the achievements were working then yeah but i don't know why they're

2780
04:25:22,220 --> 04:25:29,500
not uh so we might actually do a calming a bit earlier than expected she be as live again yes

2781
04:25:29,500 --> 04:25:40,860
she be cotton boom any any cotton boom um oh my yeah oh he's armored up

2782
04:25:43,260 --> 04:25:55,420
who's next archer i have no idea what she's doing i'm just stupid to figure out are you

2783
04:25:55,580 --> 04:26:00,460
wait do you know do you guys wait just take a guess at what you think my monetization stream

2784
04:26:00,460 --> 04:26:06,140
tomorrow is take a guess and i'll see if you guys know i'll tell you if you got it right or not

2785
04:26:10,140 --> 04:26:13,020
right where's the guy you should be here oh there is

2786
04:26:15,340 --> 04:26:21,420
right yeah feet yeah okay feet stream it's feet ASMR i'm gonna have the camera

2787
04:26:22,380 --> 04:26:27,180
on my feet and because i have dexterity in my toes i'm literally gonna hold the ASMR

2788
04:26:27,740 --> 04:26:38,300
tools with my toes and do like ASMR feet stream that's fine yeah feet yeah it's ridiculous i know

2789
04:26:43,340 --> 04:26:47,980
yeah i know it's ridiculous but i thought it was funny as anything and because my model has like

2790
04:26:48,060 --> 04:26:54,060
french tip toes i thought like yeah this is perfect i don't think my other toes are gonna

2791
04:26:54,060 --> 04:27:01,180
heal in time for it though unfortunately it's pretty mangled i don't i don't think i have to go to

2792
04:27:01,180 --> 04:27:05,420
the doctor i think i have to go to the doctor if it starts getting inflamed you needed to know more

2793
04:27:06,380 --> 04:27:12,940
now tell you what consider me your new friend in the north i'm keeping the deed any objections

2794
04:27:13,020 --> 04:27:17,900
consider it a carlaya didn't even want it why did carlaya purchase the golden state now that i know

2795
04:27:17,900 --> 04:27:26,300
who she may even uh if i was maven exactly this carlaya must have spent a lot of time

2796
04:27:28,300 --> 04:27:37,820
would be demonetized i mean can you get demonetized it's literally just fee like uh if you cannot

2797
04:27:37,900 --> 04:27:43,900
take away the ha ha funny from it it's literally just the body part and ASMR and like me is that

2798
04:27:43,900 --> 04:27:46,540
dog um i heard that

2799
04:27:50,140 --> 04:27:55,500
gods could you get any more perfect last the only concept i came up for like my monetization celebration

2800
04:27:59,740 --> 04:28:04,380
people walk on their feet all the time yeah like i just think it's more like funny ha ha than it is

2801
04:28:04,380 --> 04:28:10,060
like anything else but like i this time so i don't keep repeating it but i generally like

2802
04:28:10,060 --> 04:28:15,340
feel so feminine now that i've got like my little manicure pedicure like i felt so pampered like i was

2803
04:28:15,340 --> 04:28:21,180
completely uncomfortable with the entire situation but i did feel really pampered and i was like oh

2804
04:28:22,460 --> 04:28:28,300
this is actually kind of nice hold on a minute hold on a minute these gender norms have hands

2805
04:28:28,300 --> 04:28:35,500
god damn it not again i've fallen for another one this is too difficult it's too difficult i can't

2806
04:28:35,500 --> 04:28:43,500
resist i thought i could can you really not jump this oh fine you are very feminine literally like

2807
04:28:43,500 --> 04:28:51,420
apparently my hands are super small as well like oh these gender norms have hands foot rubs though

2808
04:28:51,980 --> 04:28:59,340
i will admit the foot rub that felt like heavenly oh my god like my like brain was like a wire and

2809
04:28:59,340 --> 04:29:04,060
funny i was like hold on this is like super relaxing i can't believe it all the freaking

2810
04:29:04,060 --> 04:29:10,620
stereotypes about whamming like in foot rubs are true it's awful i felt i felt so good though i was

2811
04:29:10,620 --> 04:29:17,100
like damn i need a need a reflin right now i need a need a sacrificial a sacrificial reflin right

2813
04:29:23,100 --> 04:29:25,820
all the sky room right now just to get to the other side of the map

2818
04:29:54,940 --> 04:29:58,940
oh i can't let yous do that the reason why the women could do it is because i had to put my

2819
04:29:58,940 --> 04:30:04,540
feet in like this little water bath so she had no clue that she was dealing with the sweaty feet

2820
04:30:04,780 --> 04:30:11,820
so we're now learning that carlaya is this evil evil trying to take down the thieves guild so

2846
04:32:55,820 --> 04:33:01,340
oh my god i would absolutely love to do a stream about the domestication of animals as well think of

2847
04:33:01,340 --> 04:33:09,820
how many endless animal species we have and there's only i think 11 domesticated species isn't that

2848
04:33:09,820 --> 04:33:14,380
amazing although there was one russian guy who tried to domesticate foxes and he actually got

2849
04:33:14,380 --> 04:33:20,780
really far but it does take years and years and you can hypnotize the chicken by drawing the line

2850
04:33:20,780 --> 04:33:27,660
and dirt in front of them oh oh i was a little moan to hit there please email them thank you

2851
04:33:29,500 --> 04:33:30,940
there's a little shack down here

2852
04:33:35,340 --> 04:33:42,380
domesticated foxes would be adorable they would oh there's a bear in this shack i recognize this

2853
04:33:42,460 --> 04:33:51,660
place from many i totally i've never heard a wolf how will like that before but

2854
04:33:51,660 --> 04:33:58,300
Lydia can you deal with them so i don't have to slow down i'm trying to make it to the location

2855
04:34:00,060 --> 04:34:04,940
there is probably bandits here actually that's one thing i do have to complain about scarring

2856
04:34:04,940 --> 04:34:11,500
there's like bandits in every freaking place ever literally i've not even approached this

2857
04:34:11,500 --> 04:34:17,180
landmark and it's like yeah bandits by the way it's like bro i didn't even get a freaking chance

2858
04:34:17,180 --> 04:34:22,060
to breathe there's always a bear foxes are difficult the worst part is they pee on everything

2859
04:34:23,180 --> 04:34:31,820
fox girl gen 2 confirmed made it into peeler confirmed right there's a stable over here so

2860
04:34:31,820 --> 04:34:39,420
we're gonna head for it what's the difference between taming and domesticating

2861
04:34:41,660 --> 04:34:48,300
taming is temporary friendship whereas domestication anyone can take over with it i think

2862
04:34:49,020 --> 04:34:54,780
because you can tame a wild hedgehog but you can't domesticate it

2863
04:34:56,620 --> 04:35:02,700
yeah no that kind of sounds like i'm on the right tracks but i did just i don't actually know the

2864
04:35:02,700 --> 04:35:13,500
real can you please discover that thank you peeler my beloved peeler confirmed by strongy

2865
04:35:13,500 --> 04:35:23,660
fox girl for peeler oh my only reason they're in is because of the the content the girls like to put

2866
04:35:23,660 --> 04:35:30,300
up domestication is an extremely long process of taming yes i would agree with that statement

2867
04:35:30,940 --> 04:35:35,100
well they put fast travel on so they had to compensate for people who'd fast travel instead

2868
04:35:35,100 --> 04:35:40,380
of walk and they need more bandits oh bro every time you want to walk like two centimeters of the

2869
04:35:40,380 --> 04:35:45,580
game's like enemy enemy enemy enemy taming is when you train a wild animal to be friendly

2870
04:35:45,580 --> 04:35:50,060
around humans domestications when you breed an animal over multiple generations to benefit a human

2871
04:35:50,060 --> 04:36:01,500
yes so a lot of people don't know that sheep um infinitely grow will that's because of human

2872
04:36:01,500 --> 04:36:07,340
selective breeding that they produce so much will and they've now require to be shaved like

2873
04:36:07,340 --> 04:36:12,220
you ever hear those stories that make the news that's like this sheep evaded the farmer for five

2874
04:36:12,220 --> 04:36:19,180
years and he has five years of like mats on him and the only reason that's actually even mildly

2875
04:36:19,180 --> 04:36:25,020
possible is because he was bred that way he was bred to produce like copious amounts of wool

2876
04:36:25,740 --> 04:36:31,260
and and it's like the same for horses you know how horses need little clippy cloppy horses

2877
04:36:31,260 --> 04:36:38,700
the reason for that is because of selective breeding and and horse in the wild will naturally wear

2878
04:36:38,700 --> 04:36:47,660
down it's rocks it's hooves on rocks and stuff like that and what is going on here who's this rk

2879
04:36:49,260 --> 04:36:58,140
um right yeah silkworms we use for silk can't survive in the world yeah i would really love to

2880
04:36:58,140 --> 04:37:04,860
do a domestication thing um i'd love to do a history one i just saw that on a per Fox

2881
04:37:05,820 --> 04:37:13,180
that wolf garden huh i don't think i've ever seen a sheep on the news yeah when you come from Scotland

2882
04:37:13,180 --> 04:37:20,940
sometimes the news is rather bland um you know not a lot going on in school if you watch the

2883
04:37:20,940 --> 04:37:32,300
Scottish news oh no he didn't meet why why does the horse who's horse is that hello i'm sorry i'm late

2884
04:37:34,860 --> 04:37:40,380
hydration check i've scouted the ruins and i'm certain carlaya is still inside

2885
04:37:41,660 --> 04:37:48,780
you saw her no i found her horse don't take care of it the horse didn't need to perish

2886
04:37:49,980 --> 04:37:57,340
let's get moving i want to catch her inside while she's distracted take the lead you want me to

2887
04:37:57,340 --> 04:38:02,300
lead understood just make certain you keep your eyes open carlaya is a selectively breeding

2888
04:38:02,940 --> 04:38:08,780
stuff for you can't say that that's hilarious you can't say that oh my god

2889
04:38:10,540 --> 04:38:16,140
that's so true what the fuck that's so funny i'm sorry i can't even laugh at that that's so funny

2890
04:38:24,060 --> 04:38:30,620
i'd rather the news be bland than hyperpolarizing oh i don't even consume the news anymore where

2891
04:38:31,180 --> 04:38:36,060
where are you bro i can hear your armor what are you doing okay there you are jeez

2892
04:38:38,140 --> 04:38:41,900
it's ironic because she's growing so much will have actually become a deficient sheep farmers

2893
04:38:41,900 --> 04:38:47,100
don't make any money from those synthetic fibers if the police will we have to go back

2894
04:38:48,220 --> 04:38:54,860
we need to go back please please no more plastic i'd like

2895
04:38:55,660 --> 04:39:01,740
same i hate watching the yeah like it's just unwatchable it just you you will finish a news

2896
04:39:01,740 --> 04:39:09,180
broadcast um and you're just like wow i hate life and it was like don't if if you consume things

2897
04:39:09,180 --> 04:39:14,380
that like genuinely make you more upset at the end of them it's it can be quite addictive and

2898
04:39:14,380 --> 04:39:19,020
comforting to like watch it in the moment but when you realize it's bad for you like you can just

2899
04:39:19,020 --> 04:39:26,380
kind of poach trump on it you know come back another time uh there are drogger up ahead but

2900
04:39:26,380 --> 04:39:38,860

2901
04:39:38,860 --> 04:39:45,740
a lot of drogger drop um soul gems which i'm needing a heck of a lot more of

2902
04:39:48,940 --> 04:39:53,420

2906
04:40:21,020 --> 04:40:23,100

2907
04:40:27,260 --> 04:40:29,260
no no

2908
04:40:29,660 --> 04:40:31,660

your feeble attempts he's like so into it

2916
04:41:29,260 --> 04:41:35,260
nope don't ask me how long it took me to find the opening to this so my first playthrough

2917
04:41:35,340 --> 04:41:44,220
it's so painful this was my first ever um skyrim game actually my dad played morrowind um

2918
04:41:45,580 --> 04:41:50,780
but my my favorite thing about morrowind is that you can just jump on the spot um

2919
04:41:53,020 --> 04:41:55,660
and then like you level up your stamina it's quite interesting

2920
04:41:56,380 --> 04:42:03,500
you mean elder school's game yeah wait what did i say my first skyrim game

2921

2924
04:42:23,500 --> 04:42:28,620
cause if i remember correctly there's not that many people left in scotland that can speak it

2925
04:42:28,620 --> 04:42:34,540
no they don't teach us that uh if you come from the mainland you don't learn gaelic at all um

2926
04:42:35,420 --> 04:42:41,180
it's basically a dying language because they refuse to teach it to the next generation

2927
04:42:41,980 --> 04:42:47,740
i don't know if it's gonna change i hope it'll change in the future but sadly no i do not speak

2928
04:42:47,820 --> 04:42:54,860
gaelic which is just how it is they do not teach it and oh pretty ship

2929
04:42:57,980 --> 04:43:04,460
um but thank you for the tip narrow yes uh very sadly they they don't teach it uh if you're

2936
04:43:42,700 --> 04:43:46,700

2945
04:44:51,820 --> 04:44:58,700
which is really cool uh i know it sounds like i'm like speaking it's because i don't use slang

my mom was like no then he speaks slang in the house so i didn't and then obviously being an

2957
04:46:21,180 --> 04:46:26,220
online creator it's a complete opposite everyone wants to hear you with a slang in every hand and

2958
04:46:26,220 --> 04:46:33,100
it's like oh right then i guess it's a bit uh it's a bit forced because i was discouraged from

2976
04:48:30,940 --> 04:48:36,540
do it because i'm like for people who watch long term they'll know like how often i get asked it

04:58:00,220 --> 04:58:03,900
he delayed the shipment even another week the legion would find someone else to take it

3058
04:58:03,900 --> 04:58:09,260
south let them keep their blasted money the road to white run is dangerous he says everyone knows

3059
04:58:09,260 --> 04:58:13,260
that so many caravans have been attacked so many travelers vanishing in thin air some say it's

3060
04:58:13,260 --> 04:58:18,300
only bandits but they're rumors are worse goblins ghosts and witches 20 years we've been married

3061
04:58:18,300 --> 04:58:21,980
now and i can't bear the thought of losing them i'm not letting them go alone not this time we'll

3062
04:58:21,980 --> 04:58:31,260
deliver die together together mara preservas oh where's the man oh no

3063
04:58:34,940 --> 04:58:41,980
oh who to who to uh it's terrible picks up coins oh who did that that's terrible

3064
04:58:42,620 --> 04:58:50,300
uh coconut crab vtuber oh isn't that not that massive gigantic crab

3065
04:58:54,620 --> 04:59:00,460
v sucky is gen 2's name by the way yeah gen 2 already i already have the logos for gen 2 and

3066
04:59:00,460 --> 04:59:05,580
three maids um because they were they it was like cheap and it was like i might as well well as the

3067
04:59:05,580 --> 04:59:10,220
matter because i already know what i'm gonna call them i'm just gonna discover this location

3068
04:59:10,940 --> 04:59:14,620
i don't know if we're gonna start going against the force one shortly there are another

3069
04:59:14,620 --> 04:59:24,860
type of bandits essentially uh right how'd i get around i guess i get around oh no rubs corpses

3070
04:59:24,860 --> 04:59:29,820
look they're not gonna need it let's be honest they're not gonna need that those nine coins

3071
04:59:29,820 --> 04:59:35,020
gen 3 spoiled no there's absolutely nothing planned of gen 3 i don't even know what concepts i want

3072
04:59:35,820 --> 04:59:42,220
um and stroney did you see what you want yes what i want i submit what i want and then i get back

3073
04:59:42,220 --> 04:59:49,020
something and then i keep going to the drawing board that's how it works so you're at my mercy

3074
04:59:51,420 --> 05:00:01,340
shoulda picked mercy you can't purchase in the afterlife gen 6 confront absolutely no i i am done

3075
05:00:02,140 --> 05:00:08,940
birthing any children after gen 3 i mean it's also like uh there's a whole other thing to it

3076
05:00:08,940 --> 05:00:15,580
there's actually a whole other trust factor as well like gen one i completely trust whole heartedly

3077
05:00:16,140 --> 05:00:20,700
like i did my thorough research on the girls and like when i when i did the interview like i never

3078
05:00:20,700 --> 05:00:27,260
got any bad vibes or whatever um which sounds terrible like oh you did an interview like an

3079
05:00:27,260 --> 05:00:33,580
informal interview and went off of was there bad vibes or not and the answer is yeah i did actually

3080
05:00:33,580 --> 05:00:39,900
um because and when you hear people talk you can get a sense of like especially when they

3081
05:00:39,900 --> 05:00:46,380
expected like a super um like a super professional thing and you're just like oh surprise it's

3082
05:00:46,380 --> 05:00:52,220
actually just me me man uh here's here's the rules type thing um mercy's patreon just went live oh she

3083
05:00:52,220 --> 05:00:59,740
got an update i can't even remember what her update was i i don't know i don't know what the tags are

3084
05:00:59,740 --> 05:01:05,500
even though i was the one who put that up there for her sounds like you got a trust your gut yeah

3085
05:01:05,500 --> 05:01:10,460
like i get described as naive a lot which i honestly don't mind i actually genuinely agree with that

3086
05:01:10,460 --> 05:01:16,860
and kind of assassin sorry i'm just trying to hit loads of markers along the way so we can just

3087
05:01:16,860 --> 05:01:23,420
backtrack like this super easily um oh is this like a little hunter's lodge thing going on oh it's

3088
05:01:23,420 --> 05:01:36,380
like a little campsite oh just we eat and good tonight after three generations there's a real

3089
05:01:36,460 --> 05:01:46,460
risk of bad actors trying to get in it yeah so because i need to choose my words carefully

3090
05:01:47,180 --> 05:01:56,540
but i hope you can agree with um my my my thought process but it may not be reality because it's

3091
05:01:56,540 --> 05:02:06,380
just my thought process um it is very plausible that there were v-tubers who were interested but

3092
05:02:06,380 --> 05:02:13,260
didn't apply because they wanted the guaranteed success of gen 2 like to see what gen 1 achieved

3093
05:02:13,260 --> 05:02:22,060
to see what gen 2 achieved because not that they didn't put their faith in the plan

3094
05:02:22,460 --> 05:02:28,780
um it's not so obviously you want to you want to be a part something that's successful let's wait

3095
05:02:28,780 --> 05:02:36,700
am i on the right way or am i on the wrong way no i'm gonna run um i need to try and think of

3096
05:02:36,700 --> 05:02:47,980
my sense just like i'm really happy with gen 1 and everyone is good basically however the rate

3097
05:02:47,980 --> 05:02:55,180
as you said the rate of a bad actor coming into play does get higher um

3098
05:02:58,140 --> 05:03:03,820
but hopefully you know there's girls like with you know plenty of experience and i can just

3099
05:03:03,820 --> 05:03:11,820
see and assess them you don't want to risk the gamble yes it's like i don't know how to say that

3100
05:03:11,820 --> 05:03:17,900
i just knew all the girl i'm trying to have a really nice moment talking about my girls okay um

3101
05:03:20,060 --> 05:03:27,100
the risk does get higher when new people are introduced that may not have previous history

3102
05:03:27,100 --> 05:03:35,340
like um what the heck what am i trying to where the heck am i trying to go you can't see me

3103
05:03:36,220 --> 05:03:37,740
um

3104
05:03:41,340 --> 05:03:43,660
i think you're doing the right thing you don't want to feel like you're

3105
05:03:43,660 --> 05:03:50,220
investing your time into the wrong thing yes that like um i did speak of someone who applied

3106
05:03:50,220 --> 05:03:54,940
and then i went on their twitch just to check them out in general and they spoke about how

3107
05:03:54,940 --> 05:04:00,540
they only want to hang around for one year and then send their audience to their old account

3108
05:04:01,260 --> 05:04:05,420
and the quote was like because the creator seems so chill or something

3109
05:04:06,140 --> 05:04:13,820
and i got an in route um and it was just like kind of shocking and it does like kind of slap

3110
05:04:13,820 --> 05:04:19,340
me back to reality that like people who apply they might not actually want to hang around and

3111
05:04:19,340 --> 05:04:26,940
achieve like loads of goals they might just do it to go do their own thing the lover stone this

3112
05:04:26,940 --> 05:04:34,860
this always feels the comforts love all skills improve faster if all skills improve faster than

3113
05:04:34,860 --> 05:04:44,620
sure call me the lover stone who would put that on social me out wow wow you know that really

3114
05:04:44,620 --> 05:04:51,980
happened um they applied their application and i pretty much checked out everyone's stream

3115
05:04:52,780 --> 05:04:58,620
um uh after they applied just to see what they were putting out there because um there was a

3116
05:04:58,620 --> 05:05:05,020
very notable trend of people applying and then all of a sudden their stream uh consistency

3117
05:05:05,020 --> 05:05:09,740
ramped up because they were getting assessed and they were aware they were getting assessed uh

3118
05:05:09,740 --> 05:05:16,380
i don't think i didn't notice that if you were one of those girls um uh there was also stream

3119
05:05:16,380 --> 05:05:25,020
variety came out nowhere some people were very glued to one type of game zero um um and all of

3120
05:05:25,020 --> 05:05:32,700
a sudden they start doing a variety of games kind of showing that they can uh play a different

3121
05:05:32,700 --> 05:05:45,180
among the games um but yes um i did get to experience someone who openly admitted that they

3122
05:05:46,620 --> 05:05:52,860
basically applied but couldn't care less about the actual longevity of violour and it is quite

3123
05:05:52,860 --> 05:06:01,340
scary to think that there's a possibility that even through my vetting process um there is a team

3124
05:06:01,340 --> 05:06:13,260
who also assessed uh the girls that get in as well um and maybe at a later date i can maybe speak a bit

3125
05:06:13,260 --> 05:06:18,380
more about it i think now is a bit too sensitive of a time because obviously it's only been

3126
05:06:19,660 --> 05:06:25,660
one week excuse me sorry just dealing with this guy

3127
05:06:26,620 --> 05:06:31,100
uh he is a very bad man do not trust him are you good

3128
05:06:34,940 --> 05:06:41,980
oh good thank you here well what do we get i think we get a gold band from or something

3129
05:06:44,460 --> 05:06:52,380
uh why were they after you no um does that affect your judgment what does what affect

3130
05:06:52,380 --> 05:06:57,660
my judgment i'm so sorry you're gonna have to go over that again i'm sorry i completely forget uh

3131
05:06:57,660 --> 05:07:04,300
what my like previous sense was azure's voice was too perfect for the character yes i i did

3132
05:07:04,300 --> 05:07:09,660
admit that if azura did not accept uh i was essentially up shit creek because everyone

3133
05:07:09,660 --> 05:07:16,860
who applied i was not satisfied with their fit for the voice i did say though i said it before

3134
05:07:16,860 --> 05:07:24,380
anyone's like that's not fair they were born that way they just got in uh what about rooting for

3197
05:14:08,780 --> 05:14:18,060
when they shoot their arrows you are what the heck i'm definitely not supposed to go in that

3198
05:14:20,780 --> 05:14:21,580

3202
05:14:43,820 --> 05:14:48,140
am i i thought you were supposed to go that way no i just took poison damage for the hell

3203
05:14:48,140 --> 05:14:55,660
a bit i was so fun i should do that again not wait did i not come from here

3204

3205
05:15:03,340 --> 05:15:07,260
okay i think i'm i may have

3206
05:15:09,100 --> 05:15:12,700
i think i went completely the wrong way pardon me i took it take a look at me

3207
05:15:15,500 --> 05:15:20,300
uh it's barred from the other side so i was going the right freaking way

3208
05:15:21,500 --> 05:15:23,260
uh right okay let's try again

3209
05:15:25,020 --> 05:15:31,020
okay i'm sure i can figure it out when i get there i feel like a some secret offer

3210
05:15:31,900 --> 05:15:37,820
no these are these are living quarters you're the stealthiest thief ever strong

3211
05:15:37,820 --> 05:15:42,620
and no one will see you if they're dead exactly i don't know why that's still going

3212
05:15:43,980 --> 05:15:48,140
because i pulled a lever uh i think i did it on the other side of the poison

3213
05:15:50,060 --> 05:15:54,300
uh i guess if you wanted to be stealth you could just go through the poison

3214
05:15:54,300 --> 05:15:55,660
but we'll just go for it

3215
05:15:55,820 --> 05:16:01,260
we're going we're going we're going

3216
05:16:04,620 --> 05:16:08,860
i'm being a dome dome okay turn that off

3217
05:16:11,740 --> 05:16:15,820
right there so it's quiet and then up the stairs literally they were right there

3218
05:16:15,820 --> 05:16:20,700
and i walked away from them it's just feeling quirky okay just feeling misunderstood

3219
05:16:21,260 --> 05:16:24,780
oh

3220
05:16:24,780 --> 05:16:29,820
just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen

3221
05:16:29,820 --> 05:16:32,220
it's okay just let it happen

3222
05:16:37,740 --> 05:16:38,860
just let it happen

3223
05:16:41,980 --> 05:16:48,780
just let it happen it's okay it's okay just let it happen

3224
05:16:48,780 --> 05:16:51,780
Mmm, big potatoes.

3225
05:16:51,780 --> 05:16:55,780
Just, oh, 20.

3226
05:16:55,780 --> 05:16:56,780
Enchanting!

3227
05:16:56,780 --> 05:16:57,780
That's good.

3228
05:16:57,780 --> 05:17:00,780
That would be like enchanting up in here.

3229
05:17:00,780 --> 05:17:01,780
Just let it happen.

3230
05:17:01,780 --> 05:17:03,780
Okay, we don't really need to...

3231
05:17:03,780 --> 05:17:04,780
Oh, the box!

3232
05:17:04,780 --> 05:17:06,780
We need that.

3233
05:17:06,780 --> 05:17:11,780
Mmm, is this the barred door?

3234
05:17:11,780 --> 05:17:12,780
It was!

3235
05:17:12,780 --> 05:17:15,780
Okay, we've now got the shark cut up.

3236
05:17:15,780 --> 05:17:17,780
So what's this?

3237
05:17:17,780 --> 05:17:19,780
It's a chest.

3238
05:17:19,780 --> 05:17:21,780
Ah, and then what's that?

3239
05:17:21,780 --> 05:17:23,780
That's just the other side of the map.

3240
05:17:23,780 --> 05:17:24,780
Oh my god, we did it.

3241
05:17:24,780 --> 05:17:25,780
It's not war crime.

3242
05:17:25,780 --> 05:17:27,780
It's just a cute girl.

3243
05:17:27,780 --> 05:17:30,780
Me committing war crimes?

3244
05:17:30,780 --> 05:17:33,780
Stop, you're making me laugh.

3245
05:17:33,780 --> 05:17:35,780
Oh my gosh, I'm so turned around.

3246
05:17:35,780 --> 05:17:39,780
It's been so long since I've done this.

3247
05:17:39,780 --> 05:17:41,780
It's called Barbarian Stealth.

3248
05:17:41,780 --> 05:17:46,780
Honestly, I actually really like that description for my thingy.

3249
05:17:46,780 --> 05:17:48,780
I've always tried to do...

3250
05:17:48,780 --> 05:17:51,780
What the heck?

3251
05:17:51,780 --> 05:17:52,780
Jump shot.

3252
05:17:52,780 --> 05:17:53,780
Oh, right.

3253
05:17:53,780 --> 05:17:54,780
Wait, what?

3254
05:17:54,780 --> 05:17:55,780
Where's the...

3255
05:17:55,780 --> 05:17:58,780
There's a tic-tac to leave there.

3256
05:17:58,780 --> 05:18:02,780
I don't think there's any enemies until they come in.

3257
05:18:02,780 --> 05:18:05,780
We just need to pick up some charcoal and a piece of paper,

3258
05:18:05,780 --> 05:18:08,780
steal the paper, steal the charcoal.

3259
05:18:08,780 --> 05:18:12,780
It took me so long to figure out this area.

3260
05:18:12,780 --> 05:18:14,780
Heavy armor increased to 16.

3261
05:18:14,780 --> 05:18:17,780
It wasn't really worth the level up, but hey, we did it.

3262
05:18:17,780 --> 05:18:18,780
I'm going to break some...

3263
05:18:18,780 --> 05:18:19,780
Break it down now.

3264
05:18:24,780 --> 05:18:25,780
Oh, look at that.

3265
05:18:25,780 --> 05:18:27,780
Look at that.

3266
05:18:27,780 --> 05:18:29,780
We do have a bow and arrow.

3267
05:18:29,780 --> 05:18:30,780
Fire damage?

3268
05:18:30,780 --> 05:18:31,780
Soul trap?

3269
05:18:31,780 --> 05:18:32,780
Maybe...

3270
05:18:32,780 --> 05:18:36,780
No, maybe not a soul trap on us.

3271
05:18:36,780 --> 05:18:38,780
I would say fire damage.

3272
05:18:38,780 --> 05:18:40,780
Take a little burn.

3273
05:18:40,780 --> 05:18:42,780
Now, what pet are your...

3274
05:18:42,780 --> 05:18:45,780
Bubbish.

3275
05:18:45,780 --> 05:18:49,780
You know Seagrog method of stealth, honestly.

3276
05:18:49,780 --> 05:18:52,780
Look, if it works, is there...

3277
05:18:52,780 --> 05:18:54,780
Is there truly a point?

3278
05:18:54,780 --> 05:18:55,780
Is there truly a point?

3279
05:18:55,780 --> 05:18:58,780
Right, so the enemies do come in here.

3280
05:18:58,780 --> 05:19:01,780
Obviously, because we are playing on legendary mode,

3281
05:19:01,780 --> 05:19:03,780
and I'm just so MLG pro.

3282
05:19:03,780 --> 05:19:04,780
Excuse me.

3283
05:19:04,780 --> 05:19:07,780
We're just going to one-shot them, confidently.

3284
05:19:07,780 --> 05:19:09,780
We are just going to one-shot them, confidently.

3285
05:19:09,780 --> 05:19:13,780
We are just going to one-shot them.

3286
05:19:13,780 --> 05:19:14,780
Nice and confidently.

3287
05:19:14,780 --> 05:19:15,780
No problems.

3288
05:19:19,780 --> 05:19:21,780
Acutely commits crimes against humans, honestly.

3289
05:19:24,780 --> 05:19:27,780
Have you played Ghost of Toshima?

3290
05:19:27,780 --> 05:19:28,780
I haven't.

3291
05:19:28,780 --> 05:19:29,780
One shot, 100%.

3292
05:19:29,780 --> 05:19:30,780
Return to the guy.

3293
05:19:30,780 --> 05:19:31,780
Where's the guy?

3294
05:19:31,780 --> 05:19:33,780
Is he in here?

3295
05:19:34,780 --> 05:19:36,780
Oh, return to the guy guy.

3296
05:19:36,780 --> 05:19:38,780
Return to the guy.

3297
05:19:40,780 --> 05:19:41,780
Walk on.

3298
05:19:45,780 --> 05:19:48,780
Why the heck does it make me go backwards?

3299
05:19:52,780 --> 05:19:54,780
It says games, but...

3300
05:19:54,780 --> 05:19:57,780
The mapping is a bit rough.

3301
05:20:01,780 --> 05:20:03,780
Can I loot this account?

3302
05:20:03,780 --> 05:20:05,780
They're so good.

3303
05:20:05,780 --> 05:20:07,780
Wait, are the guards going to attack me?

3304
05:20:07,780 --> 05:20:14,080
Are the Marker of Guards going to attack me? I'll pick them out.

3305
05:20:14,080 --> 05:20:18,340
I come back and see you're still in- Eh, no!

3306
05:20:18,340 --> 05:20:24,260
I'm sorry but these accusations are unfounded. I'm not a novice, I'm a legendary, clearly.

3307
05:20:24,260 --> 05:20:29,940
Look, I'm sorry to your untrained eye, but when you get really good at the game, it just

3308
05:20:29,940 --> 05:20:36,100
makes things- Why did it do that? Why did you do that?

3309
05:20:36,100 --> 05:20:40,700
Why does the game do that? Honestly, I could fart on it something.

3310
05:20:40,700 --> 05:20:47,260
Yeah, just- It's because I'm such a high-skilled level, it makes it appear to be a very easy level.

3311
05:20:47,260 --> 05:20:50,380
So please don't worry about it.

3312
05:20:50,380 --> 05:20:54,140
No, okay.

3313
05:20:54,140 --> 05:21:00,860
The mages don't let us go into the hall. The mages don't let us go into the hall.

3314
05:21:00,860 --> 05:21:04,180
I've played this game for two- Eh, how dare you?

3315
05:21:04,180 --> 05:21:07,660
Why is the child in the basement?

3316
05:21:07,660 --> 05:21:11,300
Right, here's the translations, bro.

3317
05:21:11,300 --> 05:21:16,060
I'm rubbing, eh?

3318
05:21:16,060 --> 05:21:21,700
When you're amazing, you make everything look easy. Yeah, legendary keyboard.

3319
05:21:21,700 --> 05:21:25,340
See how that's not valued at 50? It's not going to teach you nothing.

3320
05:21:25,340 --> 05:21:29,460
Don't open that book.

3321
05:21:29,460 --> 05:21:32,580
Maybe sometime you should judge a bit, but cover.

3322
05:21:32,580 --> 05:21:37,580
It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the guild for

3323
05:21:37,580 --> 05:21:38,580
months.

3324
05:21:38,580 --> 05:21:42,580
Mercer Frey is the baddie! Dun, dun, dun!

3325
05:21:42,580 --> 05:21:50,820
A very lavish lifestyle, replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures.

3326
05:21:50,820 --> 05:21:53,900
That's actually my specialty.

3327
05:21:53,900 --> 05:21:58,540
And yes, Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the guild's treasury

3328
05:21:58,540 --> 05:22:01,060
without anyone's knowledge.

3329
05:22:01,060 --> 05:22:06,580
Anything else, Enzo? Anything about the Nightingales?

3330
05:22:06,580 --> 05:22:09,300
The Nightingales!

3331
05:22:09,300 --> 05:22:14,500
The last few pages seem to describe the failure of the Nightingales, although it doesn't go

3332
05:22:14,500 --> 05:22:16,580
into great detail.

3333
05:22:16,580 --> 05:22:22,020
Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known

3334
05:22:22,020 --> 05:22:25,100
as the Twilight Sepulcher.

3335
05:22:25,100 --> 05:22:28,140
Shadows preserve us, so it's true.

3336
05:22:28,140 --> 05:22:29,980
She bald under that hood!

3337
05:22:29,980 --> 05:22:34,060
She's not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher, but what is it?

3338
05:22:34,060 --> 05:22:36,620
What's Mercer Frey done?

3339
05:22:36,620 --> 05:22:38,980
The Annoying Hunt is actually the bad guy.

3340
05:22:38,980 --> 05:22:41,260
I'm shocked! Color of me surprised.

3341
05:22:41,260 --> 05:22:45,620
The gold and right in standards by the dev team.

3342
05:22:45,620 --> 05:22:47,300
What's called express.

3343
05:22:47,300 --> 05:22:49,780
Bald! It always annoyed me.

3344
05:22:49,780 --> 05:22:58,220
When you put on a hood, your hair gets removed and it annoys me so much.

3345
05:22:58,220 --> 05:22:59,220
It's just such a...

3346
05:22:59,220 --> 05:23:00,220
Get away from me!

3347
05:23:00,220 --> 05:23:04,060
Excuse you, anyone talking to you?

3348
05:23:04,060 --> 05:23:08,580
Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the guild.

3349
05:23:08,580 --> 05:23:11,380
They respected Carlyer and she deserves better.

3350
05:23:11,380 --> 05:23:14,540
Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor.

3351
05:23:14,540 --> 05:23:16,020
Sure! Thank you!

3352
05:23:16,020 --> 05:23:20,700
You ever managed to gain entry to the college and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen

3353
05:23:20,700 --> 05:23:21,700
goods?

3354
05:23:21,700 --> 05:23:23,500
He's a fan!

3355
05:23:23,500 --> 05:23:28,180
I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time.

3356
05:23:28,180 --> 05:23:29,780
Questionable interest or like that.

3357
05:23:29,780 --> 05:23:32,140
You must hasten to rift in before Mercer can do any more.

3358
05:23:32,140 --> 05:23:35,140
You must hasten to rift in!

3359
05:23:35,140 --> 05:23:39,140
You've come this far, so I see no harm in conceiving it any longer.

3360
05:23:39,140 --> 05:23:40,940
Bald gen two member confirmed!

3361
05:23:40,940 --> 05:23:42,940
No! No!

3362
05:23:42,940 --> 05:23:44,940
Say it ain't so!

3363
05:23:44,940 --> 05:23:51,940
I will not go, turn the lights off, carry me home!

3364
05:23:51,940 --> 05:23:58,260
Oh my god, members karaoke, I can absolutely wreck my voice on that.

3365
05:23:58,260 --> 05:24:00,020
I can get beer!

3366
05:24:00,020 --> 05:24:02,540
I can get beer!

3367
05:24:02,540 --> 05:24:06,660
And we can do membership karaoke!

3368
05:24:06,660 --> 05:24:12,540
And I can do song requests, like you guys put it together, oh I'm pretty good.

3369
05:24:12,540 --> 05:24:21,540
And drink to your family, drink it with your friends, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

3370
05:24:21,540 --> 05:24:30,540
Beer they only drink is made for you, you'll drink till you spew, ew!

3371
05:24:30,540 --> 05:24:36,540
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

3372
05:24:36,540 --> 05:24:42,540
Carla currently and kindly explaining the nightingale lore in her relationship to Gaelas,

3373
05:24:42,540 --> 05:24:48,540
whilst I sing that one beer parody song that had that Lego animation.

3374
05:24:48,540 --> 05:24:50,540
Why are you in the basement child?

3375
05:24:50,540 --> 05:24:53,540
I'm getting, I'm getting weirded out.

3376
05:24:53,540 --> 05:24:56,540
Get, just leave me alone!

3377
05:24:56,540 --> 05:24:58,540
Get away!

3378
05:24:58,540 --> 05:25:04,540
Creepy wee thing, honestly.

3379
05:25:04,540 --> 05:25:09,540
And you sing Flare of Scotland, no I have to be hate music, I'm not singing, I'm not getting drunk and going

3380
05:25:09,540 --> 05:25:22,540
Oh, Flare of Scotland, when will we see our life again?

3381
05:25:22,540 --> 05:25:25,540
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

3382
05:25:25,540 --> 05:25:30,540
I don't know why national songs insist on going so high.

3383
05:25:30,540 --> 05:25:43,540
Like, they, can't you not just, give me one song where like the decibels, the decibels, like the notes in it are just like really common and everyone can sing it.

3384
05:25:43,540 --> 05:25:45,540
Donald, where are your choosers?

3385
05:25:45,540 --> 05:25:47,540
What's that song? I think I've ever heard of it.

3386
05:25:47,540 --> 05:25:49,540
I missed beer whilst I was grabbing a drink.

3387
05:25:49,540 --> 05:25:56,540
No, no, no, we're gonna do like drunk membership thingy.

3388
05:25:56,540 --> 05:25:58,540
Back to where I am.

3389
05:25:58,540 --> 05:26:01,540
Petra also bad poops in.

3390
05:26:01,540 --> 05:26:04,540
I'm ready, let's go.

3391
05:26:04,540 --> 05:26:09,540
I was gonna force us to sing Christmas carols on Christmas.

3392
05:26:09,540 --> 05:26:13,540
I like A Wee and a Manger.

3393
05:26:13,540 --> 05:26:17,540
A Wee and a Manger.

3394
05:26:17,540 --> 05:26:20,540
No crib for a pit.

3395
05:26:20,540 --> 05:26:22,540
Why does it go so high pitch?

3396
05:26:22,540 --> 05:26:25,540
Why can't they not just have a song that's like down here?

3397
05:26:25,540 --> 05:26:28,540
No crib for a bed.

3398
05:26:28,540 --> 05:26:35,540
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.

3399
05:26:35,540 --> 05:26:42,540
The cattle are lowing.

3400
05:26:42,540 --> 05:26:52,540
Oh yeah, I was gonna force you guys to do like freaking Christmas songs with me and then we watch Lord of the Rings on Christmas.

3401
05:26:52,540 --> 05:26:58,540
Let the winds blow high, let the winds blow to the streets and my cattle go.

3402
05:26:58,540 --> 05:27:00,540
Although as you say, oh Donald, where are you?

3403
05:27:00,540 --> 05:27:02,540
What the frick, I've never heard that.

3404
05:27:02,540 --> 05:27:06,540
Do your tit-sangle, do they wobble to the floor?

3405
05:27:06,540 --> 05:27:11,540
I can't say that, I'm sorry.

3406
05:27:11,540 --> 05:27:16,540
I'm getting a bit, I'm getting a bit delirious, hold on a minute.

3407
05:27:16,540 --> 05:27:18,540
You've never heard that song before?

3408
05:27:18,540 --> 05:27:21,540
I've never heard that song before.

3409
05:27:21,540 --> 05:27:24,540
Now what's this song called?

3410
05:27:24,540 --> 05:27:26,540
I've got a sister.

3411
05:27:26,540 --> 05:27:27,540
She's not even drunk yet.

3412
05:27:27,540 --> 05:27:29,540
Just talking about alcohol is getting me steaming.

3413
05:27:29,540 --> 05:27:31,540
It's making me lose the plot.

3414
05:27:31,540 --> 05:27:32,540
Let me see.

3415
05:27:32,540 --> 05:27:34,540
No, it can't be.

3416
05:27:34,540 --> 05:27:35,540
No, it can't be.

3417
05:27:35,540 --> 05:27:36,540
What's that mean?

3418
05:27:36,540 --> 05:27:37,540
I've known Mercer too long.

3419
05:27:37,540 --> 05:27:39,540
He quoted the main.

3420
05:27:39,540 --> 05:27:41,540
The floor?

3421
05:27:41,540 --> 05:27:42,540
Yeah, it's a bit dark.

3422
05:27:42,540 --> 05:27:44,540
We're currently in the sewers.

3423
05:27:44,540 --> 05:27:46,540
Right under your nose.

3424
05:27:46,540 --> 05:27:47,540
Do they wobble to the floor?

3425
05:27:48,540 --> 05:27:50,540
Can you tie them in the knot?

3426
05:27:50,540 --> 05:27:53,540
Can you tie them in a bow?

3427
05:27:53,540 --> 05:27:57,540
My kami oshii hates Mongolian throat singing.

3428
05:27:57,540 --> 05:28:00,540
It's because cats don't like the sound of that vibration

3429
05:28:00,540 --> 05:28:02,540
that Mongolian throat singing provides.

3430
05:28:02,540 --> 05:28:04,540
So thus, I don't like it.

3431
05:28:04,540 --> 05:28:06,540
I don't like vibrations.

3432
05:28:06,540 --> 05:28:08,540
That rrrrrrrrr.

3433
05:28:08,540 --> 05:28:09,540
No, bad.

3434
05:28:09,540 --> 05:28:10,540
Cats don't like it.

3435
05:28:10,540 --> 05:28:12,540
It makes their ears go back.

3436
05:28:12,540 --> 05:28:16,540
So it makes my ears go back.

3437
05:28:16,540 --> 05:28:18,540
The world's greatest thieves live in a sewer.

3438
05:28:18,540 --> 05:28:20,540
Down in the sewer.

3439
05:28:22,540 --> 05:28:25,540
Ever listen to the nasty shrank licks?

3440
05:28:28,540 --> 05:28:30,540
Let's go.

3441
05:28:30,540 --> 05:28:32,540
The memer is starting to break free.

3442
05:28:32,540 --> 05:28:36,540
I want to break free.

3443
05:28:36,540 --> 05:28:38,540
My cat licks it.

3444
05:28:38,540 --> 05:28:41,540
Your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing

3445
05:28:41,540 --> 05:28:44,540
and I will not be taking any further statements.

3446
05:28:44,540 --> 05:28:48,540
I assure you, your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing.

3447
05:28:48,540 --> 05:28:49,540
Base cat.

3448
05:28:49,540 --> 05:28:51,540
Absolutely not.

3449
05:28:51,540 --> 05:28:53,540
Are you sure about that?

3450
05:28:53,540 --> 05:28:55,540
Rip project when my OSD fans and shambles

3451
05:28:55,540 --> 05:28:58,540
due to the Mongolian throat singing hate.

3452
05:28:58,540 --> 05:29:03,540
Me, my life away.

3453
05:29:03,540 --> 05:29:05,540
I was so hard to sing that.

3454
05:29:05,540 --> 05:29:07,540
Any song is hard to sing.

3455
05:29:07,540 --> 05:29:09,540
My voice is so frazzled.

3456
05:29:09,540 --> 05:29:13,540
I'm just a memer.

3457
05:29:13,540 --> 05:29:18,540
I mean my life away.

3458
05:29:18,540 --> 05:29:20,540
Sorry, the thieves gold are now just revealing

3459
05:29:20,540 --> 05:29:23,540
that Mercer has betrayed them for many years

3460
05:29:23,540 --> 05:29:25,540
and there's not a penny left for them.

3461
05:29:25,540 --> 05:29:31,540
I mean my life away.

3462
05:29:31,540 --> 05:29:33,540
Away.

3463
05:29:33,540 --> 05:29:36,540
Why is camera the frog in the stream?

3464
05:29:37,540 --> 05:29:39,540
Crematy frog here.

3465
05:29:39,540 --> 05:29:43,540
I would like to do some karaoke.

3466
05:29:43,540 --> 05:29:46,540
Sing your cover live.

3467
05:29:46,540 --> 05:29:49,540
He also like rock music.

3468
05:29:49,540 --> 05:29:51,540
We doubt you don't like vibrations.

3469
05:29:51,540 --> 05:29:56,540
I've got an even funner fact.

3470
05:29:56,540 --> 05:30:02,540
I only like it.

3471
05:30:02,540 --> 05:30:04,540
Yes, yes, yes.

3472
05:30:04,540 --> 05:30:06,540
I killed Gallus, not Carly.

3473
05:30:06,540 --> 05:30:10,540
Gallus, Carly and Mercer were Nightingales.

3474
05:30:10,540 --> 05:30:14,540
Carly was behind Golden Glow and Honeybrook.

3475
05:30:14,540 --> 05:30:17,540
Say it.

3476
05:30:17,540 --> 05:30:23,540
The magic button cannot handle the vibration.

3477
05:30:23,540 --> 05:30:28,540
But the dirt road home can.

3478
05:30:28,540 --> 05:30:29,540
Oh I have permission.

3479
05:30:29,540 --> 05:30:31,540
Okay infiltrate Mercer's home.

3480
05:30:31,540 --> 05:30:33,540
Oh everyone's on alert.

3481
05:30:33,540 --> 05:30:36,540
Alert, alert, Mercer.

3482
05:30:36,540 --> 05:30:40,540
Alert, alert.

3483
05:30:40,540 --> 05:30:44,540
Oh I bet we are but you should be here.

3484
05:30:44,540 --> 05:30:47,540
I don't doubt for one second.

3485
05:30:47,540 --> 05:30:48,540
I won't remember that.

3486
05:30:48,540 --> 05:30:50,540
Please continue.

3487
05:30:50,540 --> 05:30:52,540
Information stored and saved.

3488
05:30:52,540 --> 05:30:57,540
Yeah, literally there's no doubt about it.

3489
05:30:57,540 --> 05:30:59,540
The tales get it back.

3490
05:30:59,540 --> 05:31:02,540
I didn't realise how fake speedish

3491
05:31:02,540 --> 05:31:05,540
that all the voice actors accent try to mimic.

3492
05:31:05,540 --> 05:31:07,540
It's actually quite jarring.

3493
05:31:07,540 --> 05:31:09,540
Be careful.

3494
05:31:09,540 --> 05:31:10,540
What are you talking about?

3495
05:31:10,540 --> 05:31:13,540
Hello, hello.

3496
05:31:13,540 --> 05:31:16,540
This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors.

3497
05:31:16,540 --> 05:31:17,540
Now go away.

3498
05:31:17,540 --> 05:31:19,540
I need to get inside Mercer's house please.

3499
05:31:19,540 --> 05:31:21,540
No visitors, no way.

3500
05:31:21,540 --> 05:31:24,540
Now piss off before you make me mad.

3501
05:31:24,540 --> 05:31:27,540
I'll make it worth your while.

3502
05:31:27,540 --> 05:31:30,540
You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away.

3503
05:31:30,540 --> 05:31:32,540
Unless you can talk to Maven Blackbriar

3504
05:31:32,540 --> 05:31:33,540
and let me out of my debt.

3505
05:31:33,540 --> 05:31:34,540
Okay.

3506
05:31:34,540 --> 05:31:37,540
Try and set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off.

3507
05:31:37,540 --> 05:31:42,540
Fine, I'll go talk to Maven about big, big,

3508
05:31:42,540 --> 05:31:44,540
big stinky, what's your name?

3509
05:31:44,540 --> 05:31:51,540
Bald, more like cold because it's freezing outside

3510
05:31:51,540 --> 05:31:53,540
and you're not wearing any outfit.

3511
05:31:53,540 --> 05:31:56,540
Oh, absolutely rolled and decked.

3512
05:31:56,540 --> 05:31:59,540
Hello, America Hiya.

3513
05:31:59,540 --> 05:32:03,540
No, no, no, American.

3514
05:32:03,540 --> 05:32:05,540
Wednesday is her birthday.

3515
05:32:05,540 --> 05:32:08,540
I believe it's the 23rd of August if I'm not mistaken.

3516
05:32:08,540 --> 05:32:10,540
All the crime and corruption in Riften

3517
05:32:10,540 --> 05:32:12,540
is really getting to him.

3518
05:32:12,540 --> 05:32:14,540
And now that we hear rumors about the dragon.

3519
05:32:14,540 --> 05:32:15,540
Is she not up?

3520
05:32:15,540 --> 05:32:17,540
Where is she?

3521
05:32:17,540 --> 05:32:19,540
You have some nerve coming back here

3522
05:32:19,540 --> 05:32:21,540
after what you did to Kirado.

3523
05:32:21,540 --> 05:32:22,540
He less of a shake.

3524
05:32:22,540 --> 05:32:24,540
Where's Maria?

3525
05:32:25,540 --> 05:32:27,540
Okay, hold on.

3526
05:32:27,540 --> 05:32:29,540
If I put that on, it should show more.

3527
05:32:29,540 --> 05:32:30,540
Oh, she is here.

3528
05:32:30,540 --> 05:32:32,540
You were there all along.

3529
05:32:32,540 --> 05:32:35,540
I presume you're bothering me for a while.

3530
05:32:35,540 --> 05:32:38,540
Why would you want to help that idiot?

3531
05:32:38,540 --> 05:32:41,540
He owes me a steep debt.

3532
05:32:41,540 --> 05:32:43,540
In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work.

3533
05:32:43,540 --> 05:32:46,540
If he don't want any of it, I'll take a bell for me.

3534
05:32:46,540 --> 05:32:48,540
What did he do?

3535
05:32:48,540 --> 05:32:50,540
A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill

3536
05:32:50,540 --> 05:32:52,540
from a good friend of mine in Winterhold.

3537
05:32:53,540 --> 05:32:56,540
Do you think Mercer is a claw?

3538
05:33:00,540 --> 05:33:03,540
He's in debt because of a quill?

3539
05:33:13,540 --> 05:33:17,540
Is this his quill that's in the freaking lake?

3540
05:33:22,540 --> 05:33:24,540
Oh, it's...

3541
05:33:25,540 --> 05:33:27,540
Oh, no.

3542
05:33:28,540 --> 05:33:31,540
I think it might just be easier to perish this man.

3543
05:33:33,540 --> 05:33:35,540
I think it's in a boat.

3544
05:33:35,540 --> 05:33:37,540
Oh, goodness me.

3545
05:33:37,540 --> 05:33:38,540
It's been many a year.

3546
05:33:38,540 --> 05:33:40,540
I think it's in a boat.

3547
05:33:40,540 --> 05:33:42,540
I'm gonna have to look at it on the HUD.

3548
05:33:42,540 --> 05:33:43,540
Hold on.

3549
05:33:43,540 --> 05:33:47,540
I want to say it's like somewhere here.

3550
05:33:47,540 --> 05:33:49,540
To the left.

3551
05:33:50,540 --> 05:33:53,540
Oh, I could be terribly wrong though,

3552
05:33:53,540 --> 05:33:56,540
but there should be a boat.

3553
05:33:56,540 --> 05:33:58,540
It started...

3554
05:34:07,540 --> 05:34:09,540
It's at the bottom of the lake somewhere.

3555
05:34:09,540 --> 05:34:11,540
Thank you for your help, Brief.

3556
05:34:11,540 --> 05:34:13,540
No, I really appreciate that.

3557
05:34:13,540 --> 05:34:15,540
I am somewhere at the bottom of the lake.

3558
05:34:15,540 --> 05:34:18,540
I don't even have water breathing either.

3559
05:34:18,540 --> 05:34:19,540
I can't believe you.

3560
05:34:19,540 --> 05:34:21,540
You had the audacity to take that out.

3561
05:34:21,540 --> 05:34:23,540
You're just trying to upset me.

3562
05:34:23,540 --> 05:34:24,540
What's this?

3563
05:34:24,540 --> 05:34:26,540
What's that barnacles?

3564
05:34:29,540 --> 05:34:30,540
I'm already...

3565
05:34:30,540 --> 05:34:31,540
Oh, my...

3566
05:34:33,540 --> 05:34:34,540
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3567
05:34:34,540 --> 05:34:35,540
Is this a hint?

3568
05:34:35,540 --> 05:34:36,540
Is this a hint?

3569
05:34:36,540 --> 05:34:37,540
Hold on, let me breathe.

3570
05:34:37,540 --> 05:34:40,540
Is this a hint that maybe you were around here somewhere?

3571
05:34:42,540 --> 05:34:43,540
Hold on.

3572
05:34:43,540 --> 05:34:44,540
Right.

3573
05:34:44,540 --> 05:34:45,540
Should we...

3574
05:34:45,540 --> 05:34:46,540
Oh, no.

3575
05:34:46,540 --> 05:34:47,540
Right, well, there was a box,

3576
05:34:47,540 --> 05:34:48,540
but I guess not.

3577
05:34:48,540 --> 05:34:49,540
There's rocks here.

3578
05:34:49,540 --> 05:34:52,540
Is that telling me it's here somewhere?

3579
05:34:52,540 --> 05:34:53,540
Got that barnacles.

3580
05:34:53,540 --> 05:34:54,540
There's more barnacles.

3581
05:34:54,540 --> 05:34:56,540
Oh, can you just, like, render distance, please?

3582
05:34:56,540 --> 05:34:57,540
Stronius.

3583
05:34:57,540 --> 05:34:58,540
Under the water.

3584
05:34:58,540 --> 05:34:59,540
You don't want reflins!

3585
05:35:02,540 --> 05:35:04,540
Ah, let me breathe.

3586
05:35:05,540 --> 05:35:06,540
I seem to think it's, like, the left side.

3587
05:35:06,540 --> 05:35:08,540
I saw that storage box.

3588
05:35:08,540 --> 05:35:10,540
I think that's the game being, like, hint.

3589
05:35:10,540 --> 05:35:11,540
It's over here.

3590
05:35:13,540 --> 05:35:14,540
Okay, hold on.

3591
05:35:14,540 --> 05:35:16,540
Let me just check again.

3592
05:35:17,540 --> 05:35:19,540
I think it's in a broken boat.

3593
05:35:21,540 --> 05:35:23,540
It's on the map somewhere str-

3594
05:35:23,540 --> 05:35:25,540
Right, I'm not reading chat for the next minute.

3595
05:35:25,540 --> 05:35:26,540
You're on time out.

3596
05:35:27,540 --> 05:35:28,540
You're done.

3597
05:35:29,540 --> 05:35:31,540
I seem to think it's close to the edge of the water.

3598
05:35:31,540 --> 05:35:34,540
Wait, oh, this is a bit too close, clearly.

3599
05:35:34,540 --> 05:35:35,540
By the bridge?

3600
05:35:35,540 --> 05:35:38,540
I don't recall it being by a bridge, to be honest.

3601
05:35:42,540 --> 05:35:44,540
You know what, reflin?

3602
05:35:44,540 --> 05:35:45,540
What?

3603
05:35:47,540 --> 05:35:49,540
Stronius, what do you think of the Indiana Jones game?

3604
05:35:49,540 --> 05:35:51,540
I didn't know there was a new one!

3605
05:35:54,540 --> 05:35:55,540
Aw, for goodness' sake.

3606
05:35:55,540 --> 05:35:57,540
I think I'm off the mark.

3607
05:35:57,540 --> 05:35:58,540
Where am I?

3608
05:36:01,540 --> 05:36:03,540
Maybe it's, like, down here a bit.

3609
05:36:03,540 --> 05:36:05,540
I mean, this is the entire area.

3610
05:36:05,540 --> 05:36:08,540
Okay, I'm just gonna do one big glipper on the island.

3611
05:36:08,540 --> 05:36:10,540
Why is there so many salmon?

3612
05:36:11,540 --> 05:36:12,540
Stronius, I love you.

3613
05:36:12,540 --> 05:36:13,540
Don't hate my friends.

3614
05:36:13,540 --> 05:36:15,540
Wait, why would I hate your friends?

3615
05:36:16,540 --> 05:36:17,540
I thought you weren't looking at us.

3616
05:36:17,540 --> 05:36:19,540
Look, I forgive really easily.

3617
05:36:19,540 --> 05:36:20,540
Oh no, get up!

3618
05:36:20,540 --> 05:36:22,540
Shabee, what are you doing?

3619
05:36:22,540 --> 05:36:23,540
Underwater burning.

3620
05:36:23,540 --> 05:36:24,540
Drowning.

3621
05:36:25,540 --> 05:36:29,540
Okay, I don't think it's up this way,

3622
05:36:29,540 --> 05:36:32,540
but we're gonna just do a big circle

3623
05:36:32,540 --> 05:36:35,540
for the sake of satisfying myself.

3624
05:36:39,540 --> 05:36:42,540
Come up for water often.

3625
05:36:43,540 --> 05:36:47,540
Reeflands, remember that Stronius is as much of an addict

3626
05:36:47,540 --> 05:36:48,540
as we are.

3627
05:36:50,540 --> 05:36:52,540
Scuba, Shabee.

3628
05:36:54,540 --> 05:36:56,540
Shabee, making me nervous.

3629
05:36:57,540 --> 05:36:59,540
Oh, wait, it may be on one of these islands.

3630
05:36:59,540 --> 05:37:01,540
It may be rocked up on a baby island.

3631
05:37:01,540 --> 05:37:02,540
Do you know that?

3632
05:37:02,540 --> 05:37:03,540
What the heck was that?

3633
05:37:03,540 --> 05:37:04,540
I'm rabbit!

3634
05:37:07,540 --> 05:37:09,540
Hold on, let's just check the hut again.

3635
05:37:09,540 --> 05:37:12,540
Right, we're kind of at the furthest point

3636
05:37:12,540 --> 05:37:13,540
of this section of the lake.

3637
05:37:13,540 --> 05:37:16,540
I'm not really wanting to go too much further.

3638
05:37:17,540 --> 05:37:19,540
It's near the box you found before.

3639
05:37:19,540 --> 05:37:21,540
Oh my god, I'm actually getting my hand held.

3640
05:37:21,540 --> 05:37:23,540
See, thank you, Reefling.

3641
05:37:23,540 --> 05:37:24,540
I actually get my hand held.

3642
05:37:24,540 --> 05:37:26,540
I knew it was freaking back there.

3643
05:37:26,540 --> 05:37:28,540
I've gone way off course.

3644
05:37:31,540 --> 05:37:32,540
Oh my god, I forgive.

3645
05:37:32,540 --> 05:37:34,540
Fucking Moncaius.

3646
05:37:35,540 --> 05:37:39,540
It's between the big island and Riften.

3647
05:37:40,540 --> 05:37:41,540
That's it, I'm giving in.

3648
05:37:41,540 --> 05:37:43,540
Skyrimmer's been installed.

3649
05:37:43,540 --> 05:37:44,540
Are you happy now?

3650
05:37:44,540 --> 05:37:46,540
Oh, have I put you in the Skyrim mid?

3651
05:37:46,540 --> 05:37:47,540
Yippee!

3652
05:37:47,540 --> 05:37:49,540
I can't help the sarcasm.

3653
05:37:49,540 --> 05:37:50,540
I forget where the thing is every time

3654
05:37:50,540 --> 05:37:51,540
in Wastehaven I was looking.

3655
05:37:51,540 --> 05:37:54,540
Also, it's underwater, not on an island.

3656
05:37:55,540 --> 05:37:57,540
Yeah, it's like crashed off of it.

3657
05:37:58,540 --> 05:38:00,540
My eyes are currently burning,

3658
05:38:00,540 --> 05:38:02,540
opening under the salt water.

3659
05:38:04,540 --> 05:38:06,540
Alright, I'm gonna swim.

3660
05:38:06,540 --> 05:38:07,540
Alright, that's not it.

3661
05:38:07,540 --> 05:38:09,540
These are just textures.

3662
05:38:10,540 --> 05:38:13,540
It's not like this, I can't even swim in.

3663
05:38:14,540 --> 05:38:16,540
So there's no point.

3664
05:38:17,540 --> 05:38:19,540
I'm gonna go buy that box again.

3665
05:38:20,540 --> 05:38:22,540
If I could find the box again.

3666
05:38:23,540 --> 05:38:25,540
We'll float to the right this time,

3667
05:38:25,540 --> 05:38:28,540
not to be confused with the hit TV game.

3668
05:38:28,540 --> 05:38:29,540
A little to the left.

3669
05:38:29,540 --> 05:38:31,540
I don't know why I said TV game.

3670
05:38:32,540 --> 05:38:33,540
Steam game.

3671
05:38:35,540 --> 05:38:39,540
So those were the barnacles.

3672
05:38:42,540 --> 05:38:43,540
I'm getting swept up.

3673
05:38:44,540 --> 05:38:46,540
We're trying to find the quill.

3674
05:38:48,540 --> 05:38:49,540
That maven.

3675
05:38:50,540 --> 05:38:54,540
I did not realise how rubbish this game is.

3676
05:38:54,540 --> 05:38:55,540
Is this for real?

3677
05:38:55,540 --> 05:38:58,540
There's like two floating foxes under the camp.

3678
05:38:59,540 --> 05:39:01,540
What's going on here?

3679
05:39:02,540 --> 05:39:04,540
I can see loads of broken stuff.

3680
05:39:05,540 --> 05:39:07,540
Hold on, let me breathe again.

3681
05:39:10,540 --> 05:39:11,540
Alright.

3682
05:39:12,540 --> 05:39:15,540
Definitely not searchable.

3683
05:39:15,540 --> 05:39:19,540
There's like loads of boxes just hanging off the dock.

3684
05:39:22,540 --> 05:39:23,540
It just works.

3685
05:39:23,540 --> 05:39:26,540
I think you may have floated over it.

3686
05:39:26,540 --> 05:39:28,540
It's not by the docks.

3687
05:39:28,540 --> 05:39:29,540
Oops.

3688
05:39:30,540 --> 05:39:32,540
I like the detail though,

3689
05:39:32,540 --> 05:39:34,540
the concept that like it fell off the boat

3690
05:39:34,540 --> 05:39:36,540
and they can't retrieve it.

3691
05:39:36,540 --> 05:39:37,540
It's quite smart.

3692
05:39:45,540 --> 05:39:47,540
This is where I'm on the map.

3693
05:39:48,540 --> 05:39:50,540
I'm like messing around here.

3694
05:39:52,540 --> 05:39:54,540
Isn't this rock formation maybe?

3695
05:39:56,540 --> 05:39:57,540
What the barnacles?

3696
05:39:58,540 --> 05:40:00,540
Hold on, let me breathe.

3697
05:40:00,540 --> 05:40:01,540
I'm like right...

3698
05:40:01,540 --> 05:40:02,540
I'm like freaking...

3699
05:40:02,540 --> 05:40:03,540
I'm here.

3700
05:40:03,540 --> 05:40:05,540
I doubt it got dropped here.

3701
05:40:05,540 --> 05:40:07,540
It just seems so unlikely.

3702
05:40:07,540 --> 05:40:10,540
Go straight from the docks towards the island.

3703
05:40:12,540 --> 05:40:13,540
Okay.

3704
05:40:22,540 --> 05:40:24,540
I'm searching.

3705
05:40:24,540 --> 05:40:25,540
I'm searching.

3706
05:40:25,540 --> 05:40:26,540
There's salmon.

3707
05:40:26,540 --> 05:40:27,540
There's salmon.

3708
05:40:27,540 --> 05:40:28,540
There's box.

3709
05:40:28,540 --> 05:40:29,540
There's box.

3710
05:40:29,540 --> 05:40:31,540
But it's more towards here.

3711
05:40:34,540 --> 05:40:35,540
Oh, let me breathe.

3712
05:40:35,540 --> 05:40:36,540
Hold on.

3713
05:40:37,540 --> 05:40:38,540
Okay.

3714
05:40:41,540 --> 05:40:42,540
Okay, this is new.

3715
05:40:42,540 --> 05:40:44,540
I don't think we've investigated this.

3716
05:40:45,540 --> 05:40:46,540
Maybe we have.

3717
05:40:50,540 --> 05:40:52,540
I have a freaking potion of water breathing

3718
05:40:52,540 --> 05:40:54,540
that would make this a lot easier.

3719
05:40:55,540 --> 05:40:56,540
Water breathing?

3720
05:40:56,540 --> 05:40:57,540
Where?

3721
05:40:57,540 --> 05:40:58,540
Water breathing!

3722
05:40:58,540 --> 05:41:00,540
Oh, hold 15 seconds.

3723
05:41:00,540 --> 05:41:01,540
Oh, you're too kind.

3724
05:41:01,540 --> 05:41:02,540
You're too kind.

3725
05:41:06,540 --> 05:41:07,540
Oh!

3726
05:41:07,540 --> 05:41:08,540
Oh!

3727
05:41:08,540 --> 05:41:09,540
Oh!

3728
05:41:09,540 --> 05:41:10,540
Oh!

3729
05:41:10,540 --> 05:41:11,540
Oh!

3730
05:41:11,540 --> 05:41:12,540
Oh!

3731
05:41:12,540 --> 05:41:13,540
Fucking...

3732
05:41:17,540 --> 05:41:18,540
Oh, I'm getting current.

3733
05:41:18,540 --> 05:41:20,540
I'm getting drafted away by the current.

3734
05:41:21,540 --> 05:41:22,540
Okay, fuck that.

3735
05:41:22,540 --> 05:41:24,540
Right, we're doing new one.

3736
05:41:24,540 --> 05:41:25,540
Stop! Current, stop!

3737
05:41:25,540 --> 05:41:26,540
I can't breathe.

3738
05:41:31,540 --> 05:41:32,540
Oh!

3739
05:41:40,540 --> 05:41:41,540
Ah!

3740
05:41:41,540 --> 05:41:43,540
I've only got 10 lock picks.

3741
05:41:43,540 --> 05:41:45,540
Gonna be easy on me.

3742
05:41:45,540 --> 05:41:46,540
I'm gonna need to buy some more.

3743
05:41:48,540 --> 05:41:49,540
No!

3744
05:41:49,540 --> 05:41:50,540
Less?

3745
05:41:53,540 --> 05:41:54,540
I'm like...

3746
05:41:57,540 --> 05:41:59,540
Is that less or is that more?

3747
05:42:02,540 --> 05:42:03,540
Oh!

3748
05:42:05,540 --> 05:42:06,540
Gimme that!

3749
05:42:06,540 --> 05:42:08,540
Stupid bastard!

3750
05:42:08,540 --> 05:42:09,540
You're a quill.

3751
05:42:09,540 --> 05:42:10,540
Right.

3752
05:42:10,540 --> 05:42:11,540
We did it.

3753
05:42:11,540 --> 05:42:12,540
Oh my god, that took a while.

3754
05:42:14,540 --> 05:42:16,540
Just get Volsang

3755
05:42:16,540 --> 05:42:17,540
and forget about that.

3756
05:42:17,540 --> 05:42:18,540
What's Volsang?

3757
05:42:19,540 --> 05:42:20,540
She's got it.

3758
05:42:20,540 --> 05:42:22,540
If she can open the box, literally.

3759
05:42:22,540 --> 05:42:23,540
What's inside the box?

3760
05:42:23,540 --> 05:42:25,540
That fucking quill!

3761
05:42:26,540 --> 05:42:27,540
You did it.

3762
05:42:27,540 --> 05:42:29,540
You're the first person in history to buy lock picks.

3763
05:42:29,540 --> 05:42:30,540
They're so common.

3764
05:42:30,540 --> 05:42:32,540
I don't want to keep forgetting to fill it.

3765
05:42:32,540 --> 05:42:33,540
Hi, do you want a quill?

3766
05:42:36,540 --> 05:42:37,540
I found the quill.

3767
05:42:44,540 --> 05:42:45,540
Yes.

3768
05:42:48,540 --> 05:42:49,540
Okay.

3769
05:42:50,540 --> 05:42:51,540
Oh, okay.

3770
05:42:51,540 --> 05:42:52,540
Oh, that's Exile.

3771
05:42:52,540 --> 05:42:53,540
That's not very nice.

3772
05:42:53,540 --> 05:42:54,540
He's made his pals here.

3773
05:42:55,540 --> 05:42:57,540
Do you want to reconsider Exile on someone?

3774
05:42:57,540 --> 05:42:58,540
That's not very...

3775
05:42:58,540 --> 05:42:59,540
That's not very nice.

3776
05:42:59,540 --> 05:43:00,540
Have you heard of that?

3777
05:43:00,540 --> 05:43:03,540
Have you heard how damaging that can be to someone's social life?

3778
05:43:04,540 --> 05:43:06,540
Makes them feel like they're not a part of the community.

3779
05:43:06,540 --> 05:43:08,540
Have to, you know, uproot and go elsewhere.

3780
05:43:08,540 --> 05:43:09,540
Not nice.

3781
05:43:09,540 --> 05:43:10,540
It's trying to suck at this guy room.

3782
05:43:10,540 --> 05:43:11,540
I know.

3783
05:43:12,540 --> 05:43:13,540
Eh, you.

3784
05:43:13,540 --> 05:43:14,540
Come...

3785
05:43:14,540 --> 05:43:15,540
Come here.

3786
05:43:15,540 --> 05:43:17,540
I can't talk to him yet or he'll be aggressive.

3787
05:43:17,540 --> 05:43:18,540
Like...

3788
05:43:19,540 --> 05:43:20,540
You.

3789
05:43:20,540 --> 05:43:21,540
Psst.

3790
05:43:21,540 --> 05:43:22,540
Psst.

3791
05:43:22,540 --> 05:43:23,540
Psst.

3792
05:43:23,540 --> 05:43:24,540
Psst.

3793
05:43:24,540 --> 05:43:25,540
Here.

3794
05:43:25,540 --> 05:43:26,540
Over here.

3795
05:43:26,540 --> 05:43:27,540
What?

3796
05:43:27,540 --> 05:43:28,540
What?

3797
05:43:28,540 --> 05:43:29,540
Or Big Vault.

3798
05:43:29,540 --> 05:43:30,540
Sorry.

3799
05:43:30,540 --> 05:43:31,540
Big Vault.

3800
05:43:31,540 --> 05:43:32,540
Oh, oh, he's going to that gate.

3801
05:43:32,540 --> 05:43:33,540
Hold on.

3802
05:43:33,540 --> 05:43:35,540
If we're fast enough, if we're fast enough, we can go.

3803
05:43:35,540 --> 05:43:37,540
We can go talk to him on the other side of that gate.

3804
05:43:37,540 --> 05:43:38,540
Vault.

3805
05:43:38,540 --> 05:43:39,540
Vault.

3806
05:43:39,540 --> 05:43:40,540
Hold on.

3807
05:43:40,540 --> 05:43:41,540
Vault.

3808
05:43:41,540 --> 05:43:42,540
It's me.

3809
05:43:42,540 --> 05:43:43,540
It's me.

3810
05:43:43,540 --> 05:43:44,540
No, no, no.

3811
05:43:44,540 --> 05:43:45,540
He's come back to the original position.

3812
05:43:45,540 --> 05:43:46,540
No, Vault.

3813
05:43:46,540 --> 05:43:47,540
Wait, Vault.

3814
05:43:47,540 --> 05:43:48,540
Wait.

3815
05:43:48,540 --> 05:43:49,540
Let me talk to you.

3816
05:43:49,540 --> 05:43:50,540
I just want to talk to you.

3817
05:43:50,540 --> 05:43:51,540
I just want to talk to you.

3818
05:43:51,540 --> 05:43:52,540
I just want to talk to you.

3819
05:43:52,540 --> 05:43:53,540
I just want to talk to you.

3820
05:43:53,540 --> 05:43:54,540
Vault.

3821
05:43:54,540 --> 05:43:55,540
Vault.

3822
05:43:55,540 --> 05:43:56,540
Oh.

3823
05:43:56,540 --> 05:43:57,540
I have something for you.

3824
05:43:59,540 --> 05:44:00,540
Here.

3825
05:44:00,540 --> 05:44:01,540
It's your debt with Maven.

3826
05:44:01,540 --> 05:44:02,540
You're free.

3827
05:44:13,540 --> 05:44:14,540
What are you doing?

3828
05:44:14,540 --> 05:44:15,540
How's he added?

3829
05:44:15,540 --> 05:44:17,540
Are you just coming out now?

3830
05:44:17,540 --> 05:44:19,540
Oh, he is.

3831
05:44:19,540 --> 05:44:20,540
Oh.

3832
05:44:20,540 --> 05:44:21,540
Can't talk.

3833
05:44:21,540 --> 05:44:22,540
I'm out of here.

3834
05:44:22,540 --> 05:44:23,540
Okay.

3835
05:44:23,540 --> 05:44:24,540
Thank you.

3836
05:44:24,540 --> 05:44:25,540
Thank you very much.

3837
05:44:25,540 --> 05:44:27,540
Can I just come in this way?

3838
05:44:27,540 --> 05:44:28,540
Oh, it's barred.

3839
05:44:28,540 --> 05:44:29,540
Wait.

3840
05:44:29,540 --> 05:44:31,540
I need a bow and arrow.

3841
05:44:31,540 --> 05:44:34,540
Or can I just hit this?

3842
05:44:34,540 --> 05:44:35,540
Okay.

3843
05:44:35,540 --> 05:44:36,540
No.

3844
05:44:36,540 --> 05:44:38,540
You need a bow and arrow.

3845
05:44:38,540 --> 05:44:40,540
I was being a bit...

3846
05:44:40,540 --> 05:44:44,540
Let me just...

3847
05:44:44,540 --> 05:44:45,540
Oh.

3848
05:44:46,540 --> 05:44:47,540
Ta-da.

3849
05:44:48,540 --> 05:44:50,540
That's how you get the ramp down.

3850
05:44:50,540 --> 05:44:51,540
Super fuss.

3851
05:44:51,540 --> 05:44:52,540
He's skipping tone.

3852
05:44:52,540 --> 05:44:53,540
No reason.

3853
05:44:59,540 --> 05:45:02,540
I just subbed to all the girls' accounts.

3854
05:45:02,540 --> 05:45:03,540
Heck yeah, dude.

3855
05:45:03,540 --> 05:45:06,540
We love supporting gen-mates out here.

3856
05:45:09,540 --> 05:45:11,540
Oh, the whole linear.

3857
05:45:11,540 --> 05:45:12,540
You animal.

3858
05:45:12,540 --> 05:45:14,540
Literally finishing off the kill.

3859
05:45:14,540 --> 05:45:20,540
She said, nah, I want to be the reason for death on the death certificate.

3860
05:45:20,540 --> 05:45:22,540
Jeez, Louise girl.

3861
05:45:23,540 --> 05:45:26,540
The bar is locked in place and cannot be opened.

3862
05:45:26,540 --> 05:45:27,540
Okay.

3863
05:45:28,540 --> 05:45:29,540
Any money?

3864
05:45:29,540 --> 05:45:31,540
Garnet, I'll take you.

3865
05:45:31,540 --> 05:45:34,540
I can sell it for some money.

3866
05:45:34,540 --> 05:45:35,540
Statue of Debalah.

3867
05:45:35,540 --> 05:45:36,540
How about that?

3868
05:45:36,540 --> 05:45:37,540
Can I move that one?

3869
05:45:37,540 --> 05:45:38,540
Nope.

3870
05:45:38,540 --> 05:45:39,540
Can't move that one either.

3871
05:45:39,540 --> 05:45:40,540
Okay.

3872
05:45:40,540 --> 05:45:42,540
What's in this house then, I guess?

3873
05:45:42,540 --> 05:45:44,540
Let's go F myself.

3874
05:45:44,540 --> 05:45:45,540
Wait.

3875
05:45:45,540 --> 05:45:46,540
What?

3876
05:45:46,540 --> 05:45:48,540
This isn't the end.

3877
05:45:48,540 --> 05:45:49,540
Hold on.

3878
05:45:54,540 --> 05:45:55,540
Right here?

3879
05:45:55,540 --> 05:45:56,540
Ah.

3880
05:45:56,540 --> 05:45:57,540
Yeah.

3881
05:45:57,540 --> 05:45:59,540
Right, I'm not touching anything else.

3882
05:45:59,540 --> 05:46:02,540
Suspicious clothes.

3883
05:46:02,540 --> 05:46:05,540
Honestly, I wouldn't have figured that out more.

3884
05:46:05,540 --> 05:46:08,540
If we ended up a little cheeky here in the portion.

3885
05:46:09,540 --> 05:46:10,540
What's this?

3886
05:46:11,540 --> 05:46:13,540
I have no idea what this is.

3887
05:46:13,540 --> 05:46:14,540
That looks like a trap.

3888
05:46:14,540 --> 05:46:15,540
Lydia.

3889
05:46:15,540 --> 05:46:16,540
Lydia.

3890
05:46:16,540 --> 05:46:17,540
Lydia, stop standing on stuff, Lydia.

3891
05:46:17,540 --> 05:46:18,540
Lydia.

3892
05:46:18,540 --> 05:46:19,540
Lydia.

3893
05:46:20,540 --> 05:46:22,540
I'm getting sliced in days.

3894
05:46:22,540 --> 05:46:23,540
Hold on.

3895
05:46:25,540 --> 05:46:28,540
I'm getting absolutely chopped up.

3896
05:46:28,540 --> 05:46:30,540
Oh, and there's poison doors.

3897
05:46:30,540 --> 05:46:31,540
Mine.

3898
05:46:31,540 --> 05:46:32,540
Goodness.

3899
05:46:32,540 --> 05:46:33,540
You need to relax.

3900
05:46:34,540 --> 05:46:35,540
Oh my God.

3901
05:46:35,540 --> 05:46:36,540
Money.

3902
05:46:37,540 --> 05:46:38,540
Okay, I've got that.

3903
05:46:38,540 --> 05:46:39,540
What's this?

3904
05:46:39,540 --> 05:46:40,540
Eh.

3905
05:46:41,540 --> 05:46:42,540
What even?

3906
05:46:43,540 --> 05:46:44,540
What is this book?

3907
05:46:44,540 --> 05:46:45,540
I have curiosity.

3908
05:46:45,540 --> 05:46:47,540
What's the contents of this book?

3909
05:46:47,540 --> 05:46:49,540
I've never actually written it.

3910
05:46:53,540 --> 05:46:54,540
Lift her tail.

3911
05:46:54,540 --> 05:46:56,540
Certainly not, kind sir.

3912
05:46:56,540 --> 05:46:58,540
I am here to clean your chambers.

3913
05:46:58,540 --> 05:47:00,540
Is that all you have come?

3914
05:47:00,540 --> 05:47:02,540
Is that all you have come here for?

3915
05:47:02,540 --> 05:47:04,540
Little one, my chambers.

3916
05:47:04,540 --> 05:47:06,540
I have no idea what it is you imply, master.

3917
05:47:06,540 --> 05:47:08,540
I am but a poor Argonian maid.

3918
05:47:08,540 --> 05:47:09,540
Bro, what?

3919
05:47:09,540 --> 05:47:11,540
So you are my dumpling.

3920
05:47:11,540 --> 05:47:12,540
And a good one at that.

3921
05:47:12,540 --> 05:47:14,540
Such strong legs and shapely tail.

3922
05:47:14,540 --> 05:47:15,540
You embarrass me, sir.

3923
05:47:15,540 --> 05:47:17,540
Fear not, you're safe with me.

3924
05:47:17,540 --> 05:47:19,540
I must finish my cleaning, sir.

3925
05:47:19,540 --> 05:47:21,540
The mistress will have my head if I do not.

3926
05:47:21,540 --> 05:47:22,540
Cleaning, eh?

3927
05:47:22,540 --> 05:47:24,540
I have something for you right here.

3928
05:47:25,540 --> 05:47:27,540
Polish my spear.

3929
05:47:27,540 --> 05:47:28,540
But it is huge.

3930
05:47:28,540 --> 05:47:30,540
It could take me all night.

3931
05:47:30,540 --> 05:47:31,540
Plenty of time.

3932
05:47:31,540 --> 05:47:32,540
My sweet plenty.

3933
05:47:34,540 --> 05:47:37,540
I've never fucking read that.

3934
05:47:38,540 --> 05:47:41,540
Oh my god, that's hilarious.

3935
05:47:43,540 --> 05:47:44,540
Many thanks.

3936
05:47:44,540 --> 05:47:47,540
Not certain how you managed to get your hands on this item we discussed,

3937
05:47:47,540 --> 05:47:48,540
but I'm more than pleased.

3938
05:47:48,540 --> 05:47:53,540
I thought you'd simply wait until transported to Castle Diver to its final destination

3939
05:47:53,540 --> 05:47:56,540
but according to what I've heard, it vanished right from their armory.

3940
05:47:56,540 --> 05:47:58,540
I wish I knew how you were able to slip by the guards,

3941
05:47:58,540 --> 05:48:01,540
bypass the porticolas,

3942
05:48:01,540 --> 05:48:05,540
unlock the armory door and break in at the door of a puzzle-locked chest.

3943
05:48:05,540 --> 05:48:07,540
You need to teach me that little trick sometime.

3944
05:48:07,540 --> 05:48:09,540
I've left your cut in the usual drop spot

3945
05:48:09,540 --> 05:48:11,540
and might have another drop where you soon are.

3946
05:48:13,540 --> 05:48:15,540
There's three more books of it.

3947
05:48:15,540 --> 05:48:17,540
Oh my god, but I've never...

3948
05:48:17,540 --> 05:48:18,540
I knew the books existed.

3949
05:48:18,540 --> 05:48:19,540
Wait, what am I doing?

3950
05:48:20,540 --> 05:48:21,540
Expert!

3951
05:48:24,540 --> 05:48:26,540
Can we do it?

3952
05:48:27,540 --> 05:48:34,540
Okay, but we have it.

3953
05:48:36,540 --> 05:48:37,540
Easy.

3954
05:48:39,540 --> 05:48:40,540
Easy.

3955
05:48:40,540 --> 05:48:42,540
Okay, a bit more, I think.

3956
05:48:42,540 --> 05:48:44,540
Or maybe it was left, I don't know.

3957
05:48:45,540 --> 05:48:47,540
Okay, maybe it's left, you know that.

3958
05:48:49,540 --> 05:48:50,540
Easy.

3959
05:48:52,540 --> 05:48:54,540
Easy, I'm getting nervous.

3960
05:48:55,540 --> 05:48:56,540
Easy.

3961
05:49:02,540 --> 05:49:04,540
Alright, we got childrens.

3962
05:49:04,540 --> 05:49:05,540
I'll take childrens.

3963
05:49:05,540 --> 05:49:06,540
Not a bother at all.

3964
05:49:07,540 --> 05:49:09,540
Not a bother at all.

3965
05:49:12,540 --> 05:49:14,540
The rat weevils, yes.

3966
05:49:15,540 --> 05:49:16,540
Let's go.

3967
05:49:16,540 --> 05:49:17,540
Let's go.

3968
05:49:23,540 --> 05:49:26,540
I don't remember what way to go.

3969
05:49:27,540 --> 05:49:28,540
Is it this one?

3970
05:49:31,540 --> 05:49:33,540
Oh no, this is if you want Dragonborn.

3971
05:49:35,540 --> 05:49:36,540
Can you stop attacking me?

3972
05:49:37,540 --> 05:49:38,540
Whoa, your bull!

3973
05:49:39,540 --> 05:49:40,540
It's an imperial bull.

3974
05:49:41,540 --> 05:49:45,540
I think an imperial bull is better than what I've got right now.

3975
05:49:46,540 --> 05:49:49,540
Although mine does have burn damage, so...

3976
05:49:50,540 --> 05:49:53,540
I wish YouTube had other emotes, I know.

3977
05:49:54,540 --> 05:49:59,540
YouTube is like very slowly catching up to the appeal of...

3978
05:50:01,540 --> 05:50:03,540
I'm not doing any more lockpicking, I don't know.

3979
05:50:03,540 --> 05:50:07,540
YouTube is very slowly catching up to what the appeal of Twitch is.

3980
05:50:07,540 --> 05:50:11,540
To the point where it is going to take over Twitch, I'm sorry.

3981
05:50:11,540 --> 05:50:12,540
It just is.

3982
05:50:13,540 --> 05:50:15,540
Why did I drop down?

3983
05:50:15,540 --> 05:50:18,540
I've just added so much time to this travel.

3984
05:50:21,540 --> 05:50:28,540
I did not recall how long it takes to place Skyrim.

3985
05:50:29,540 --> 05:50:32,540
We're literally not even finished one questline yet.

3986
05:50:36,540 --> 05:50:38,540
Tear him up, Lydia!

3987
05:50:40,540 --> 05:50:41,540
Okay, there we go.

3988
05:50:41,540 --> 05:50:42,540
Emm...

3989
05:50:44,540 --> 05:50:45,540
Emmys rats!

3990
05:50:46,540 --> 05:50:48,540
I'm so confused, where did that come from?

3991
05:50:48,540 --> 05:50:49,540
I dropped down there.

3992
05:50:52,540 --> 05:50:53,540
Okay.

3993
05:50:53,540 --> 05:50:54,540
Ugh, there you go.

3994
05:50:55,540 --> 05:50:59,540
Channel emotes soon, channel emotes literally less than 24 hours, have fun.

3995
05:51:00,540 --> 05:51:03,540
Am I almost supposed to speak to Brinyo?

3996
05:51:04,540 --> 05:51:08,540
You know what, if I had that selected, that probably would have gone a lot faster than what I just did there.

3997
05:51:11,540 --> 05:51:17,540
Underestimating the 1000 plus hours game, but literally I was like, right, we'll do the Thieves Guild, we'll do Dark Brotherhood.

3998
05:51:17,540 --> 05:51:23,540
We're literally six hours into this stream, I've less than six hours and I've not even finished Thieves.

3999
05:51:24,540 --> 05:51:25,540
Oh, sorry, sorry.

4000
05:51:25,540 --> 05:51:27,540
I got a bit excited there, I apologize.

4001
05:51:35,540 --> 05:51:36,540
Okay, let's do that.

4002
05:51:36,540 --> 05:51:37,540
How much?

4003
05:51:38,540 --> 05:51:39,540
How many?

4004
05:51:39,540 --> 05:51:40,540
How much heavy am I?

4005
05:51:40,540 --> 05:51:43,540
Curry, wait, it's 2, 18 out of 3, 30.

4006
05:51:43,540 --> 05:51:46,540
That'll do, I need like 100 stuff.

4007
05:51:46,540 --> 05:51:47,540
Hi, Carlaya.

4008
05:51:49,540 --> 05:51:50,540
How long do we have?

4009
05:51:50,540 --> 05:51:52,540
Yeah, less than six hours because of this.

4010
05:51:54,540 --> 05:51:56,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4011
05:52:00,540 --> 05:52:03,540
No, the wise two people inviting me to talk, there's too many people.

4012
05:52:07,540 --> 05:52:10,540
Wait, so do you do every sequel?

4013
05:52:10,540 --> 05:52:11,540
No.

4014
05:52:11,540 --> 05:52:21,540
I was just going to do Thieves Guild, Black, Assassins, what, that's not what they're called.

4015
05:52:22,540 --> 05:52:30,540
The Dark Brotherhood, and then the Vampire, and then the main quest, and I've done nothing yet, so I don't think it's happening.

4016
05:52:33,540 --> 05:52:35,540
Dark Brotherhood, yes.

4017
05:52:37,540 --> 05:52:39,540
Hi, Brainyo, smashes into wall.

4018
05:52:44,540 --> 05:52:50,540
The trinity of streams on YouTube, YouTube shorts and recycled clips with 10 minutes highlights on the same platform.

4019
05:52:51,540 --> 05:52:54,540
And also just a cheat for exposure.

4020
05:52:54,540 --> 05:53:00,540
Yeah, like Twitch is exposed, it's very interesting to see breakdowns on either website.

4021
05:53:01,540 --> 05:53:02,540
Like, I've just...

4022
05:53:03,540 --> 05:53:05,540
Meet Carlaya at the Sanding Zone.

4023
05:53:05,540 --> 05:53:07,540
Okay, we're about to become a nightingale.

4024
05:53:07,540 --> 05:53:15,540
I know I've literally skipped through all the dialogue, so for anyone who hasn't consumed Skyrim and is listening in at home, I apologize greatly.

4025
05:53:16,540 --> 05:53:24,540
I can just give you the TLDR, more than happy to provide such a thing for you.

4026
05:53:24,540 --> 05:53:26,540
How the heck do I get out of this area?

4027
05:53:30,540 --> 05:53:33,540
I'll just go out of the docks, how about that?

4028
05:53:33,540 --> 05:53:35,540
I don't think you can jump over.

4029
05:53:37,540 --> 05:53:39,540
If you haven't played Skyrim, go play Skyrim.

4030
05:53:41,540 --> 05:53:43,540
Mind yourself.

4031
05:53:43,540 --> 05:53:46,540
I'd be a rifting guard, I'd be like, yeah.

4032
05:53:48,540 --> 05:53:50,540
Don't be causing trouble.

4033
05:53:54,540 --> 05:53:55,540
Hi, Maul.

4034
05:53:59,540 --> 05:54:01,540
Any news involving the Dark Brotherhood?

4035
05:54:04,540 --> 05:54:09,540
Oh, that's the other... that's the Brotherhood quest.

4036
05:54:09,540 --> 05:54:15,540
Well, that was lucky we talked to him to get that, because we'd probably just have to kill Grelok the kind.

4037
05:54:16,540 --> 05:54:18,540
And she's actually not very kind.

4038
05:54:18,540 --> 05:54:19,540
What's this?

4039
05:54:19,540 --> 05:54:20,540
Oh, it's a clay deposit.

4040
05:54:23,540 --> 05:54:25,540
The T-Skilled quest line is mostly yapping at this point.

4041
05:54:25,540 --> 05:54:30,540
Honestly, we're about to become nightingales, and it's about to be yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.

4042
05:54:30,540 --> 05:54:32,540
I thought I was a good yapper.

4043
05:54:32,540 --> 05:54:34,540
Yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.

4044
05:54:34,540 --> 05:54:37,540
Hello, hello!

4045
05:54:37,540 --> 05:54:39,540
I'm glad you're here.

4046
05:54:39,540 --> 05:54:42,540
What's the significance of this place?

4047
05:54:42,540 --> 05:54:45,540
This is the headquarters of the nightingales.

4048
05:54:45,540 --> 05:54:48,540
Cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.

4049
05:54:48,540 --> 05:54:49,540
See?

4050
05:54:49,540 --> 05:54:52,540
We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.

4051
05:54:52,540 --> 05:54:53,540
Okay, yeah.

4052
05:54:53,540 --> 05:54:55,540
What kind of an edge?

4053
05:54:57,540 --> 05:54:59,540
What kind of an edge?

4054
05:54:59,540 --> 05:55:03,540
If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.

4055
05:55:03,540 --> 05:55:04,540
Yeah.

4056
05:55:07,540 --> 05:55:10,540
Yeah, let's edge this way, please.

4057
05:55:11,540 --> 05:55:13,540
Oh, look at them steps.

4058
05:55:13,540 --> 05:55:15,540
Look at that bow, though.

4059
05:55:15,540 --> 05:55:17,540
I actually want that bow.

4060
05:55:17,540 --> 05:55:21,540
Look at the satchel that the arrow's going.

4061
05:55:21,540 --> 05:55:25,540
I like how they're coded to look like what the arrow is.

4062
05:55:25,540 --> 05:55:26,540
Very nice.

4063
05:55:26,540 --> 05:55:28,540
Very, very nice.

4064
05:55:30,540 --> 05:55:33,540
I heard about this place when I joined the gale,

4065
05:55:33,540 --> 05:55:35,540
but I never believed it existed.

4066
05:55:35,540 --> 05:55:37,540
I never believed it existed?

4067
05:55:38,540 --> 05:55:40,540
I took enough and I'm back.

4068
05:55:40,540 --> 05:55:42,540
Are you surprised I'm still on?

4069
05:55:42,540 --> 05:55:46,540
Um, is Emi's room in today?

4070
05:55:46,540 --> 05:55:47,540
Emi?

4071
05:55:47,540 --> 05:55:48,540
Or is it?

4072
05:55:48,540 --> 05:55:51,540
No, Emi should already be on.

4073
05:55:51,540 --> 05:55:56,540
Azura should be coming online in two minutes.

4074
05:55:56,540 --> 05:55:59,540
If I have my times correct.

4075
05:56:02,540 --> 05:56:04,540
Emi's off today.

4076
05:56:05,540 --> 05:56:07,540
Just Sheevee and Mersey.

4077
05:56:07,540 --> 05:56:08,540
So Mersey's on at one.

4078
05:56:08,540 --> 05:56:09,540
Right.

4079
05:56:09,540 --> 05:56:11,540
We'll redirect into Mersey.

4080
05:56:11,540 --> 05:56:12,540
Deal?

4081
05:56:12,540 --> 05:56:14,540
I'll make you a deal.

4082
05:56:14,540 --> 05:56:16,540
We'll redirect into Mersey.

4083
05:56:19,540 --> 05:56:23,540
Yeah, but we're in the nightingales like Robin Hood or something?

4084
05:56:23,540 --> 05:56:28,540
I, the first time I did this,

4085
05:56:28,540 --> 05:56:30,540
like the nightingale quest,

4086
05:56:30,540 --> 05:56:33,540
I was in love with Lady Luck.

4087
05:56:33,540 --> 05:56:35,540
I absolutely just...

4088
05:56:35,540 --> 05:56:38,540
Ow, that was very loud in my ear.

4089
05:56:38,540 --> 05:56:40,540
Hopefully that wasn't too loud in your ear.

4090
05:56:40,540 --> 05:56:47,540
I just absolutely and truly adored the like,

4091
05:56:47,540 --> 05:56:48,540
plot.

4092
05:56:48,540 --> 05:56:53,540
Oh, I like so cool.

4093
05:56:53,540 --> 05:56:57,540
I just look so amazing and awesome.

4094
05:56:57,540 --> 05:56:58,540
Everything.

4095
05:56:58,540 --> 05:57:00,540
I am ready for the oath.

4096
05:57:00,540 --> 05:57:03,540
Now you go get changed.

4097
05:57:03,540 --> 05:57:05,540
Best looking armor in the game.

4098
05:57:05,540 --> 05:57:08,540
Honestly, this armor and Dark Brotherhood armor.

4099
05:57:08,540 --> 05:57:12,540
Yeah, that's awesome.

4100
05:57:12,540 --> 05:57:15,540
I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.

4101
05:57:15,540 --> 05:57:18,540
I may have misheard you, but Mersey is in three hours.

4102
05:57:18,540 --> 05:57:19,540
No one.

4103
05:57:19,540 --> 05:57:23,540
Yeah, no, Mersey comes online at one o'clock for me.

4104
05:57:23,540 --> 05:57:25,540
One o'clock in the afternoon, yeah?

4105
05:57:25,540 --> 05:57:28,540
That's when Mersey comes online for me.

4106
05:57:28,540 --> 05:57:31,540
So Mersey's actually perfect for us.

4107
05:57:31,540 --> 05:57:35,540
Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a nightingale.

4108
05:57:35,540 --> 05:57:36,540
Whoa, that lass.

4109
05:57:36,540 --> 05:57:38,540
I appreciate the armor.

4110
05:57:38,540 --> 05:57:39,540
But becoming a nightingale?

4111
05:57:39,540 --> 05:57:41,540
That was never discussed.

4112
05:57:41,540 --> 05:57:48,540
To hold any oath of defeating Mersey, we must have Nocturnal at our backs.

4113
05:57:48,540 --> 05:57:53,540
If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck.

4114
05:57:53,540 --> 05:57:54,540
So dramatic.

4115
05:57:54,540 --> 05:57:56,540
What sort of arrangement?

4116
05:57:56,540 --> 05:57:58,540
I need to know the terms.

4117
05:57:58,540 --> 05:58:00,540
What time did I start streaming?

4118
05:58:00,540 --> 05:58:03,540
Oh, I started streaming, yeah?

4119
05:58:03,540 --> 05:58:06,540
At 4 a.m., yeah?

4120
05:58:06,540 --> 05:58:09,540
I started at 4 a.m.

4121
05:58:09,540 --> 05:58:13,540
I started at 4 a.m.

4122
05:58:13,540 --> 05:58:17,540
You never wondered why everyone's schedule has a cheeky time zone

4123
05:58:17,540 --> 05:58:19,540
that no one uses?

4124
05:58:19,540 --> 05:58:22,540
Because that's my time zone.

4125
05:58:22,540 --> 05:58:24,540
If it means the end of Mersey Frey,

4126
05:58:24,540 --> 05:58:26,540
you can count on those night hours.

4127
05:58:26,540 --> 05:58:28,540
Yeah.

4128
05:58:28,540 --> 05:58:30,540
Are you ready to transact the oath?

4129
05:58:30,540 --> 05:58:32,540
Yes, I will become nightingale.

4130
05:58:32,540 --> 05:58:35,540
Yes, I'm ready.

4131
05:58:35,540 --> 05:58:38,540
Please stand on the western circle.

4132
05:58:38,540 --> 05:58:41,540
Holy crap, 4 a.m.

4133
05:58:41,540 --> 05:58:48,540
The reason why I stream so early is in case I need to do stuff during the day.

4134
05:58:48,540 --> 05:58:53,540
Originally, it was either I stream at 4 a.m. or I stream at 10 a.m.

4135
05:58:53,540 --> 05:58:57,540
But the problem is, if I stream at 10 a.m., the day is over

4136
05:58:57,540 --> 05:59:00,540
by the time I finish my endurance streams.

4137
05:59:00,540 --> 05:59:05,540
So I wouldn't be able to do doctor's appointments if I need to make an appointment.

4138
05:59:05,540 --> 05:59:08,540
Lydia, you're going to ruin this so much.

4139
05:59:08,540 --> 05:59:11,540
Please stand elsewhere.

4140
05:59:11,540 --> 05:59:13,540
Or just go...

4141
05:59:13,540 --> 05:59:16,540
Lydia, you're going to ruin this scene so much.

4142
05:59:16,540 --> 05:59:18,540
I'm not being funny.

4143
05:59:18,540 --> 05:59:22,540
Come here, Lydia. You're going to ruin the awesomeness of this scene.

4144
05:59:22,540 --> 05:59:24,540
Lydia.

4145
05:59:24,540 --> 05:59:26,540
Wait here.

4146
05:59:26,540 --> 05:59:29,540
Thank you. There's such a beautiful cinematic coming up

4147
05:59:29,540 --> 05:59:31,540
and they don't know what it is yet.

4148
05:59:31,540 --> 05:59:33,540
Just let it happen.

4149
05:59:34,540 --> 05:59:36,540
Oh, not Lydia standing in the corner, right?

4150
05:59:36,540 --> 05:59:38,540
Just don't look at her. Don't acknowledge her, okay?

4151
05:59:38,540 --> 05:59:41,540
She's like a dinosaur.

4152
05:59:41,540 --> 05:59:44,540
Alright, let's enjoy this because this is actually pretty cool.

4153
06:00:03,540 --> 06:00:07,540
What could you possibly offer me now?

4154
06:00:07,540 --> 06:00:11,540
I have two others that wish to transact the earth

4155
06:00:11,540 --> 06:00:14,540
to serve you both in life and in death.

4156
06:00:14,540 --> 06:00:16,540
You surprise me, Caroline.

4157
06:00:16,540 --> 06:00:20,540
This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.

4158
06:00:20,540 --> 06:00:22,540
In my favor?

4159
06:00:22,540 --> 06:00:27,540
My appetite for mercy tomorrow succeeds my craving for wealth and grace.

4160
06:00:27,540 --> 06:00:31,540
Revenge. How interesting.

4161
06:00:31,540 --> 06:00:33,540
Very well.

4162
06:00:33,540 --> 06:00:35,540
The conditions are acceptable.

4163
06:00:35,540 --> 06:00:37,540
You may proceed.

4164
06:00:37,540 --> 06:00:41,540
Lady Nocturne, we accept your terms.

4165
06:00:41,540 --> 06:00:43,540
I ain't saying none of this.

4166
06:00:43,540 --> 06:00:47,540
She sells to you as both your avengers and your sentinels.

4167
06:00:47,540 --> 06:00:50,540
We will honor our agreement in this life and the next

4168
06:00:50,540 --> 06:00:53,540
until the conditions have been met.

4169
06:00:53,540 --> 06:00:57,540
Very well. I name your entrance night and day

4170
06:00:57,540 --> 06:01:01,540
and I restore your status to the same, Caroline.

4171
06:01:01,540 --> 06:01:05,540
And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain

4172
06:01:05,540 --> 06:01:08,540
from disappointing me.

4173
06:01:12,540 --> 06:01:15,540
Wait, we don't get to see her?

4174
06:01:15,540 --> 06:01:17,540
I didn't see her.

4175
06:01:17,540 --> 06:01:19,540
Okay, normal. I thought we got to see her.

4176
06:01:19,540 --> 06:01:21,540
I guess it's with the next cinematic.

4177
06:01:21,540 --> 06:01:23,540
I don't know. What do you mean we?

4178
06:01:23,540 --> 06:01:26,540
It's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you.

4179
06:01:26,540 --> 06:01:29,540
Mercy's true crime.

4180
06:01:29,540 --> 06:01:31,540
Well, he's done more.

4181
06:01:31,540 --> 06:01:34,540
Mercy was able to unlock the guilt vault without two keys

4182
06:01:34,540 --> 06:01:36,540
because of what he stole from the twilight sepulchre.

4183
06:01:36,540 --> 06:01:38,540
That's Scaly key.

4184
06:01:38,540 --> 06:01:41,540
By doing this, he's compromised our time to return

4185
06:01:41,540 --> 06:01:45,540
and in essence caused our luck to run dry.

4186
06:01:45,540 --> 06:01:48,540
So the key doesn't lock any doors.

4187
06:01:48,540 --> 06:01:52,540
But the key isn't only restricted to physical barriers.

4188
06:01:52,540 --> 06:01:55,540
All of us possess untapped abilities.

4189
06:01:55,540 --> 06:01:59,540
The potential to upgrade power is securely sealed within our minds.

4190
06:01:59,540 --> 06:02:02,540
Once you realize the key can access these traits,

4191
06:02:02,540 --> 06:02:06,540
the potential becomes limitless.

4192
06:02:06,540 --> 06:02:10,540
The three sounds like no one should possess it.

4193
06:02:10,540 --> 06:02:12,540
Good. Then you understand why this is a...

4194
06:02:12,540 --> 06:02:16,540
It's too much power for one human to have.

4195
06:02:16,540 --> 06:02:19,540
If the key isn't returned to its lock in the twilight sepulchre...

4196
06:02:19,540 --> 06:02:21,540
We see her when we return the key.

4197
06:02:21,540 --> 06:02:23,540
Yes, we will do that.

4198
06:02:23,540 --> 06:02:27,540
As time passed, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence.

4199
06:02:27,540 --> 06:02:29,540
And whether you know it or not,

4200
06:02:29,540 --> 06:02:32,540
our uncanny luck defines our trade.

4201
06:02:32,540 --> 06:02:36,540
First time I've ever set out to return something?

4202
06:02:36,540 --> 06:02:38,540
In our line of work,

4203
06:02:38,540 --> 06:02:43,540
it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner.

4204
06:02:43,540 --> 06:02:45,540
Let's go then.

4205
06:02:45,540 --> 06:02:47,540
Brynjolf has some business to discuss.

4206
06:02:47,540 --> 06:02:49,540
I suggest you listen to him.

4207
06:02:49,540 --> 06:02:51,540
All right, big Bryny. What's up?

4208
06:02:51,540 --> 06:02:56,540
Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer.

4209
06:02:56,540 --> 06:02:57,540
Uh-huh.

4210
06:02:57,540 --> 06:02:59,540
The leadership of the guild.

4211
06:02:59,540 --> 06:03:01,540
Oh my god, he's tapping his way through.

4212
06:03:01,540 --> 06:03:03,540
Oh, he's doing a wee Irish dance for us.

4213
06:03:03,540 --> 06:03:05,540
Oh, did-did-did-did-did-did-did.

4214
06:03:05,540 --> 06:03:08,540
I and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.

4215
06:03:08,540 --> 06:03:12,540
Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed.

4216
06:03:12,540 --> 06:03:14,540
After we deal with him,

4217
06:03:14,540 --> 06:03:18,540
all that remains is restoring the guild to its full strength.

4218
06:03:18,540 --> 06:03:21,540
Wovens, have you used the skeleton key on someone's torso?

4219
06:03:21,540 --> 06:03:23,540
What kind of question is that?

4220
06:03:23,540 --> 06:03:25,540
I'll be back soon to have fun, yeah.

4221
06:03:25,540 --> 06:03:28,540
Don't worry if you guys need to leave at any point.

4222
06:03:28,540 --> 06:03:30,540
I'll be-I'll be at it.

4223
06:03:32,540 --> 06:03:34,540
He is.

4224
06:03:34,540 --> 06:03:36,540
He's tapping away there.

4225
06:03:36,540 --> 06:03:38,540
Mm-hmm.

4226
06:03:39,540 --> 06:03:41,540
Sorry, I'm trying to focus on your words,

4227
06:03:41,540 --> 06:03:44,540
but your foot is moving and it's making me laugh.

4228
06:03:45,540 --> 06:03:47,540
It's about time.

4229
06:03:47,540 --> 06:03:50,540
No, it's not right. I don't know what to say.

4230
06:03:54,540 --> 06:03:57,540
So don't get sentimental on me now, except...

4231
06:04:02,540 --> 06:04:04,540
We'll handle the details.

4232
06:04:04,540 --> 06:04:06,540
Ooh.

4233
06:04:06,540 --> 06:04:08,540
We have quite the task ahead.

4234
06:04:08,540 --> 06:04:11,540
Ah! Then let's get to it.

4235
06:04:14,540 --> 06:04:17,540
What if we try to use the key on Strani?

4236
06:04:17,540 --> 06:04:20,540
And implying you don't have free reign of me?

4237
06:04:21,540 --> 06:04:24,540
Refling. You know me better than that.

4238
06:04:26,540 --> 06:04:28,540
Yeah. Right.

4239
06:04:30,540 --> 06:04:33,540
Lydia, I'm sorry that I put you in exile.

4240
06:04:33,540 --> 06:04:35,540
Yes, follow me.

4241
06:04:35,540 --> 06:04:37,540
My thing.

4242
06:04:37,540 --> 06:04:41,540
I can't believe I made myself Lydia 2.0.

4243
06:04:41,540 --> 06:04:43,540
Strani using the key on Refling?

4244
06:04:46,540 --> 06:04:49,540
It's funny, you think you have any resistance against me.

4245
06:04:58,540 --> 06:05:02,540
Roy is regaining his own foot in the way he tapped him.

4246
06:05:04,540 --> 06:05:06,540
Sure.

4247
06:05:07,540 --> 06:05:13,540
Oh yeah, becoming Guildmaster is bugged if you don't do the radiant quest first.

4248
06:05:13,540 --> 06:05:16,540
Oh, I've always managed to do them after.

4249
06:05:17,540 --> 06:05:19,540
I don't even know how they...

4250
06:05:19,540 --> 06:05:23,540
Where the heck do you expect me to go?

4251
06:05:24,540 --> 06:05:26,540
Eh, let's do that then.

4252
06:05:28,540 --> 06:05:31,540
Strani considering you don't have many lockpicks,

4253
06:05:31,540 --> 06:05:34,540
it may be beneficial just to hold on to it for a while.

4254
06:05:34,540 --> 06:05:36,540
For a while, honestly though.

4255
06:05:36,540 --> 06:05:39,540
Right, I need to go a little to the left.

4256
06:05:39,540 --> 06:05:42,540
Not to be confused with the hit steam game.

4257
06:05:42,540 --> 06:05:44,540
A little to the left.

4258
06:05:44,540 --> 06:05:46,540
Let's get to it.

4259
06:05:46,540 --> 06:05:51,540
If I can get up this hill then the enemies in that building won't be able to know me.

4260
06:05:51,540 --> 06:05:53,540
Why would I resist Strani?

4261
06:05:53,540 --> 06:05:55,540
Exactly, why would you?

4262
06:05:55,540 --> 06:05:57,540
Anyone who puts up a fight gets...

4263
06:05:57,540 --> 06:05:59,540
Twice as hard.

4264
06:06:00,540 --> 06:06:05,540
Oh, hopefully you can figure out what the substitute was for that word.

4265
06:06:05,540 --> 06:06:06,540
That's terrible.

4266
06:06:06,540 --> 06:06:07,540
Wait, that's north.

4267
06:06:07,540 --> 06:06:08,540
I'm going the wrong way.

4268
06:06:08,540 --> 06:06:11,540
No, it's like along the waterfront.

4269
06:06:14,540 --> 06:06:15,540
I would just...

4270
06:06:15,540 --> 06:06:16,540
What?

4271
06:06:16,540 --> 06:06:17,540
Sounds good.

4272
06:06:17,540 --> 06:06:18,540
Hi, Strani.

4273
06:06:18,540 --> 06:06:20,540
Dang, you're going hard into this game.

4274
06:06:20,540 --> 06:06:23,540
We haven't even finished one questline yet.

4275
06:06:23,540 --> 06:06:27,540
It's officially been six hours and I haven't finished one questline.

4276
06:06:27,540 --> 06:06:32,540
I completely forgot how just humongous what this game is.

4277
06:06:32,540 --> 06:06:37,540
It's extraordinary that I haven't actually...

4278
06:06:37,540 --> 06:06:40,540
I'm about to get close to finishing the thieves.

4279
06:06:40,540 --> 06:06:48,540
But even then, I'm not even going to truly finish them due to the reason of what.

4280
06:06:48,540 --> 06:06:58,540
Because we're not even going to do those miscellaneous quests for the Thieves Guild to restore it to its final glory.

4281
06:06:58,540 --> 06:07:01,540
Because...

4282
06:07:01,540 --> 06:07:03,540
Do I take the lift here?

4283
06:07:03,540 --> 06:07:05,540
No, I still don't take the lift.

4284
06:07:05,540 --> 06:07:09,540
Keep the skeleton key for yourself.

4285
06:07:09,540 --> 06:07:13,540
No, I'll be a good girl because I want to see a mummy nocturnal.

4286
06:07:13,540 --> 06:07:15,540
I really like her design.

4287
06:07:16,540 --> 06:07:19,540
I wouldn't mind incorporating...

4288
06:07:19,540 --> 06:07:21,540
Well, I wouldn't mind.

4289
06:07:21,540 --> 06:07:23,540
It's a very good design.

4290
06:07:23,540 --> 06:07:25,540
Okay, the phone goes the same.

4291
06:07:25,540 --> 06:07:27,540
How the heck did I get where I'm going?

4292
06:07:27,540 --> 06:07:33,540
Literally every time I have to go somewhere, I just start spamming E on a hill and I'm like, is this where I'm supposed to go?

4293
06:07:33,540 --> 06:07:36,540
No, I don't really have to walk up the hill yet.

4294
06:07:36,540 --> 06:07:38,540
No, I don't have to walk up the hill.

4295
06:07:38,540 --> 06:07:39,540
It's fine.

4296
06:07:39,540 --> 06:07:40,540
It's fine.

4297
06:07:40,540 --> 06:07:42,540
I saw that orbing.

4298
06:07:42,540 --> 06:07:45,540
Now I'm not sure if I should resist or not.

4299
06:07:45,540 --> 06:07:48,540
Either way, the outcome is clear.

4300
06:07:48,540 --> 06:07:50,540
The hor...

4301
06:07:50,540 --> 06:07:52,540
Oh, I thought it was the wind.

4302
06:07:52,540 --> 06:07:53,540
It was rules.

4303
06:07:53,540 --> 06:07:56,540
You don't need the key when you get a log pick into a hundred.

4304
06:07:56,540 --> 06:07:58,540
Oh, I didn't know that.

4305
06:07:58,540 --> 06:08:01,540
Does everything just become easy piece of lemon squeezy?

4306
06:08:01,540 --> 06:08:04,540
Or do the log picks not break on a hundred or something?

4307
06:08:04,540 --> 06:08:06,540
We're getting there.

4308
06:08:06,540 --> 06:08:07,540
We can do it.

4309
06:08:07,540 --> 06:08:08,540
I'm leaving us.

4310
06:08:08,540 --> 06:08:11,540
We're just a little exhausted.

4311
06:08:11,540 --> 06:08:14,540
I'm scarous.

4312
06:08:14,540 --> 06:08:19,540
I thought for some reason, you said I'm scouse and I was like, right?

4313
06:08:19,540 --> 06:08:21,540
Now what?

4314
06:08:21,540 --> 06:08:24,540
Oh yeah, by the way, I'm scouse.

4315
06:08:24,540 --> 06:08:27,540
I like the way you talk, Scottish lass.

4316
06:08:27,540 --> 06:08:29,540
You know, right?

4317
06:08:29,540 --> 06:08:31,540
Can I buy a cheeky Maccas?

4318
06:08:31,540 --> 06:08:34,540
Wait, Maccas is Australian term.

4319
06:08:34,540 --> 06:08:36,540
I can't believe it.

4320
06:08:36,540 --> 06:08:38,540
We're boarding live here today.

4321
06:08:38,540 --> 06:08:41,540
We are going to...

4322
06:08:41,540 --> 06:08:44,540
This place is actually covered in bandits.

4323
06:08:44,540 --> 06:08:48,540
I cannot for the life of me doing Australian accent.

4324
06:08:48,540 --> 06:08:51,540
Who we are?

4325
06:08:51,540 --> 06:08:52,540
Ray, what's this?

4326
06:08:52,540 --> 06:08:53,540
A gate.

4327
06:08:53,540 --> 06:08:54,540
Open the gate.

4328
06:08:54,540 --> 06:08:55,540
Why not?

4329
06:08:55,540 --> 06:08:58,540
That may come and help me with future...

4330
06:08:58,540 --> 06:09:00,540
Go on a Maccas run, yeah?

4331
06:09:00,540 --> 06:09:03,540
Get in void with me, yeah?

4332
06:09:03,540 --> 06:09:05,540
Oh, I thought it was going to one shot you.

4333
06:09:05,540 --> 06:09:07,540
I'm going to be honest.

4334
06:09:07,540 --> 06:09:10,540
Yeah, you can beg for mercy when you're dead.

4335
06:09:25,540 --> 06:09:26,540
Oh, I bonked him.

4336
06:09:26,540 --> 06:09:27,540
Wait, give me that.

4337
06:09:27,540 --> 06:09:29,540
I will destroy that.

4338
06:09:29,540 --> 06:09:30,540
What is this?

4339
06:09:30,540 --> 06:09:31,540
Can someone look this up?

4340
06:09:31,540 --> 06:09:33,540
What I'm supposed to do with it?

4341
06:09:33,540 --> 06:09:35,540
Flood, var, la, stone.

4342
06:09:35,540 --> 06:09:37,540
I don't know what it is.

4343
06:09:37,540 --> 06:09:40,540
Flood, var, la, stone.

4344
06:09:40,540 --> 06:09:42,540
I've never seen them before.

4345
06:09:42,540 --> 06:09:44,540
PC seems to have them.

4346
06:09:44,540 --> 06:09:46,540
Xbox doesn't seem to have them.

4347
06:09:46,540 --> 06:09:48,540
But mercy's in three hours.

4348
06:09:48,540 --> 06:09:50,540
So you should have paid for that.

4349
06:09:50,540 --> 06:09:51,540
Sorry, I got a lot.

4350
06:09:51,540 --> 06:09:52,540
Go itch on my head.

4351
06:09:54,540 --> 06:09:56,540
Speak to Carlaya.

4352
06:09:58,540 --> 06:10:00,540
Ooh, they got...

4353
06:10:00,540 --> 06:10:02,540
I... good luck.

4354
06:10:02,540 --> 06:10:04,540
Egg's fair is a bit much.

4355
06:10:04,540 --> 06:10:06,540
I've done that for souls.

4356
06:10:07,540 --> 06:10:10,540
Right, the machines drop...

4357
06:10:10,540 --> 06:10:11,540
Where's Lydia?

4358
06:10:14,540 --> 06:10:16,540
Lydia, you do this all the time.

4359
06:10:16,540 --> 06:10:19,540
There should be an enemy that pops out of here, yeah.

4360
06:10:19,540 --> 06:10:21,540
Oh, that's right, I remember.

4361
06:10:21,540 --> 06:10:24,540
These guys used to tweak me out.

4362
06:10:24,540 --> 06:10:25,540
I'm actually...

4363
06:10:25,540 --> 06:10:27,540
Tell you what, that was like really loud.

4364
06:10:27,540 --> 06:10:30,540
I'm going to...

4365
06:10:31,540 --> 06:10:33,540
Sentence, audio.

4366
06:10:35,540 --> 06:10:37,540
Is that a bit better on your ears?

4367
06:10:37,540 --> 06:10:40,540
I feel like whenever that happens, it's so loud.

4368
06:10:43,540 --> 06:10:46,540
A new hand has touched the beak.

4369
06:10:46,540 --> 06:10:48,540
Now, these do drop, yeah.

4370
06:10:48,540 --> 06:10:50,540
That's exactly what I'm wanting.

4371
06:10:50,540 --> 06:10:52,540
Like, tons of these soul gems.

4372
06:10:57,540 --> 06:10:59,540
Oh, hold on.

4373
06:10:59,540 --> 06:11:02,540
246, we're getting there, we're getting there.

4374
06:11:04,540 --> 06:11:06,540
Yes, oh my goodness, this is what we want.

4375
06:11:06,540 --> 06:11:09,540
Like, massive amounts of these soul gems.

4376
06:11:09,540 --> 06:11:12,540
And then we can put, like, really good stuff on.

4377
06:11:12,540 --> 06:11:15,540
There should be one that pops out of here.

4378
06:11:17,540 --> 06:11:18,540
Yeah.

4379
06:11:18,540 --> 06:11:19,540
Oh, I'm getting too good.

4380
06:11:19,540 --> 06:11:22,540
I'm genuinely too good at this game, I'm sorry.

4381
06:11:22,540 --> 06:11:25,540
The fact that I remember from childhood,

4382
06:11:25,540 --> 06:11:28,540
where the enemies, like, come out...

4383
06:11:28,540 --> 06:11:31,540
I'm just gonna show you how scared I was with the enemies.

4384
06:11:34,540 --> 06:11:35,540
Come here.

4385
06:11:35,540 --> 06:11:37,540
Okay, there we go.

4386
06:11:37,540 --> 06:11:39,540
What was that, three to scavenge?

4387
06:11:39,540 --> 06:11:41,540
Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it.

4388
06:11:42,540 --> 06:11:44,540
I'll take it, I'll take anything.

4389
06:11:44,540 --> 06:11:47,540
I'm happy with anything, any offerings I'll take.

4390
06:11:47,540 --> 06:11:49,540
Oh, yeah!

4391
06:11:51,540 --> 06:11:53,540
Is the enemy from here?

4392
06:11:54,540 --> 06:11:55,540
Here.

4393
06:11:56,540 --> 06:11:58,540
Oh, I heard that!

4394
06:11:58,540 --> 06:12:01,540
I heard them, like, spidering up here.

4395
06:12:06,540 --> 06:12:08,540
I can hear an enemy.

4396
06:12:12,540 --> 06:12:14,540
Oh, I heard two, just one in there.

4397
06:12:14,540 --> 06:12:16,540
But I need to go here.

4398
06:12:18,540 --> 06:12:20,540
They're so tiny!

4399
06:12:22,540 --> 06:12:24,540
They're so tiny!

4400
06:12:26,540 --> 06:12:28,540
Oh, we are getting so many soldiers.

4401
06:12:28,540 --> 06:12:31,540
This is exactly what I was needing, one of the runs in here.

4402
06:12:31,540 --> 06:12:34,540
That spawn sneak is actually impressive.

4403
06:12:37,540 --> 06:12:39,540
Ah!

4404
06:12:44,540 --> 06:12:46,540
There, them.

4405
06:12:47,540 --> 06:12:49,540
Okay, we can destroy that.

4406
06:12:49,540 --> 06:12:51,540
Yeah, let's go.

4407
06:12:52,540 --> 06:12:54,540
Alchemy.

4408
06:12:57,540 --> 06:13:00,540
Yeah, yeah, I'll take the potions, let's go.

4409
06:13:00,540 --> 06:13:03,540
Oh my god, I just jumped in real life.

4410
06:13:03,540 --> 06:13:06,540
Because of that noise, of that latch.

4411
06:13:08,540 --> 06:13:10,540
Oh, hello.

4412
06:13:15,540 --> 06:13:17,540
Those bandits back there.

4413
06:13:17,540 --> 06:13:19,540
Dot, dot, dot.

4414
06:13:22,540 --> 06:13:25,540
We have to catch up to him before it's too late.

4415
06:13:25,540 --> 06:13:29,540
I had the brap lever, literally jumped scared of me.

4416
06:13:29,540 --> 06:13:33,540
I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us.

4417
06:13:36,540 --> 06:13:39,540
Oh, he really got me there, didn't he?

4418
06:13:39,540 --> 06:13:42,540
Look, there's so many, oh, soul gems.

4419
06:13:42,540 --> 06:13:46,540
We love soul gems, soul gems, soul gems, soul gems.

4420
06:13:46,540 --> 06:13:48,540
Oh, wait, is this the thing?

4421
06:13:48,540 --> 06:13:51,540
I'm supposed to watch him, look, there he is.

4422
06:13:51,540 --> 06:13:53,540
Look through the bars.

4423
06:13:53,540 --> 06:13:55,540
I'm trying to, where is he?

4424
06:13:55,540 --> 06:13:58,540
I'm pretty sure he pops out somewhere here.

4425
06:13:58,540 --> 06:14:02,540
And this is a, this is an instance report.

4426
06:14:02,540 --> 06:14:04,540
I've returned to continue watching.

4427
06:14:04,540 --> 06:14:06,540
Where?

4428
06:14:07,540 --> 06:14:09,540
Oh, there he is, there he is.

4429
06:14:09,540 --> 06:14:11,540
That's Mercer, look, I'm crawling over.

4430
06:14:11,540 --> 06:14:13,540
Look at this little cinematic.

4431
06:14:14,540 --> 06:14:17,540
Oh, like, has he just expired right now?

4432
06:14:21,540 --> 06:14:24,540
Oh, he didn't even move a sword.

4433
06:14:27,540 --> 06:14:30,540
Eyelash, and we'll be ready for him.

4434
06:14:31,540 --> 06:14:33,540
Man, FOV is so low.

4435
06:14:33,540 --> 06:14:36,540
Do you get motion sickness? No.

4436
06:14:38,540 --> 06:14:42,540
I'm very lucky, Mercer says she gets motion sickness playing video games.

4437
06:14:42,540 --> 06:14:45,540
Not to be dramatic, but I think I would end it.

4438
06:14:45,540 --> 06:14:48,540
Oh, God, I think there's farmer around here.

4439
06:14:50,540 --> 06:14:51,540
What's this?

4440
06:14:51,540 --> 06:14:53,540
Potions.

4441
06:14:53,540 --> 06:14:57,540
Lutions and potions, I do love a good, I do love a good collection.

4442
06:14:57,540 --> 06:15:00,540
Isn't there a farmer here? No?

4443
06:15:00,540 --> 06:15:01,540
Empty?

4444
06:15:01,540 --> 06:15:03,540
Oh, found him.

4445
06:15:03,540 --> 06:15:04,540
Found him.

4446
06:15:04,540 --> 06:15:08,540
Shit, and I have course of poison.

4447
06:15:08,540 --> 06:15:10,540
What does he draw?

4448
06:15:11,540 --> 06:15:14,540
Skibertail, nah, you're good.

4449
06:15:14,540 --> 06:15:17,540
You, I want your soul gems.

4450
06:15:18,540 --> 06:15:20,540
Who am I perishing?

4451
06:15:20,540 --> 06:15:23,540
Why is Mercer such a poopy poopy?

4452
06:15:34,540 --> 06:15:38,540
I just smacked myself into a wall at low health.

4453
06:15:38,540 --> 06:15:40,540
Okay, that'll do.

4454
06:15:40,540 --> 06:15:42,540
I think I'll be okay though.

4455
06:15:42,540 --> 06:15:45,540
That was a jump scare and a half.

4456
06:15:48,540 --> 06:15:51,540
Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

4457
06:15:51,540 --> 06:15:54,540
Actually, it's probably really good that I have that on a panic,

4458
06:15:54,540 --> 06:15:57,540
because it gets me away from the enemy really quickly.

4459
06:15:58,540 --> 06:16:01,540
What the heck is this? Let's just stop.

4460
06:16:03,540 --> 06:16:05,540
Oh, I need to go up.

4461
06:16:06,540 --> 06:16:08,540
Excuse me?

4462
06:16:11,540 --> 06:16:15,540
The freaking blades on the ground took all my expert!

4463
06:16:16,540 --> 06:16:18,540
Are we having a troll?

4464
06:16:26,540 --> 06:16:28,540
And where's the other lever?

4465
06:16:29,540 --> 06:16:32,540
Excuse me, Brinyel, if you're just smacked me in the...

4466
06:16:32,540 --> 06:16:34,540
That's the other lever there?

4467
06:16:35,540 --> 06:16:37,540
Behind an egg spare?

4468
06:16:38,540 --> 06:16:40,540
That can't be right.

4469
06:16:40,540 --> 06:16:42,540
Surely not.

4470
06:16:42,540 --> 06:16:44,540
But it is.

4471
06:16:48,540 --> 06:16:51,540
That cannae be right, don't you have the skeleton key?

4472
06:16:51,540 --> 06:16:53,540
No, we've not done that part.

4473
06:16:57,540 --> 06:16:59,540
But that is it.

4474
06:17:03,540 --> 06:17:06,540
Well, good thing I don't have a smurf it, but what?

4475
06:17:06,540 --> 06:17:09,540
Wait. Oh, that's not the lever at all.

4476
06:17:11,540 --> 06:17:13,540
Where the heck's the first lever?

4477
06:17:16,540 --> 06:17:18,540
Is it here?

4478
06:17:20,540 --> 06:17:23,540
Where's the second lever? Reveal yourself!

4479
06:17:26,540 --> 06:17:28,540
What?

4480
06:17:28,540 --> 06:17:31,540
There it is! Oh, it's adjacent to the other lever!

4481
06:17:31,540 --> 06:17:33,540
Oh my god.

4482
06:17:33,540 --> 06:17:35,540
Did I need to go all the way back again?

4483
06:17:35,540 --> 06:17:38,540
Out my way, out my way, out my way, out my way.

4484
06:17:38,540 --> 06:17:40,540
I'm not that fast.

4485
06:17:40,540 --> 06:17:42,540
Hold on, hold on, I need to cheat.

4486
06:17:42,540 --> 06:17:44,540
I'm not that fast.

4487
06:17:44,540 --> 06:17:48,540
I was gonna say, putting something behind an expert level thing is wild.

4488
06:17:53,540 --> 06:17:56,540
That wasn't it? Okay, I was gonna say, that has to be it.

4489
06:17:56,540 --> 06:17:58,540
I refuse.

4490
06:17:59,540 --> 06:18:01,540
A little cheeky chess.

4491
06:18:03,540 --> 06:18:06,540
I'm being trolled by this game.

4492
06:18:11,540 --> 06:18:14,540
I'm being through trolled.

4493
06:18:14,540 --> 06:18:18,540
I'll destroy that, and then I can get more thingy.

4494
06:18:18,540 --> 06:18:20,540
Are we there yet, bruv?

4495
06:18:20,540 --> 06:18:23,540
I feel the same, we've literally not even finished one questline.

4496
06:18:23,540 --> 06:18:25,540
I'm ready to make another cup of tea.

4497
06:18:25,540 --> 06:18:30,540
Alright, you can stealth this area, but I'd rather just go for it.

4498
06:18:30,540 --> 06:18:32,540
I'd rather just go for it.

4499
06:18:41,540 --> 06:18:44,540
By the Pope, who's there? Identify yourself.

4500
06:18:44,540 --> 06:18:49,540
There is a chess down below, but I'm not really fast right now.

4501
06:18:49,540 --> 06:18:53,540
I want to finish one questline!

4502
06:18:53,540 --> 06:18:56,540
One questline is all I have.

4503
06:18:56,540 --> 06:18:59,540
Stop it, you're so stinky.

4504
06:19:01,540 --> 06:19:03,540
Okay, hold on, you got something?

4505
06:19:03,540 --> 06:19:04,540
Charmin's Key.

4506
06:19:04,540 --> 06:19:07,540
What was this, a Charmin's Key, dude?

4507
06:19:07,540 --> 06:19:09,540
Oh, is it for that?

4508
06:19:09,540 --> 06:19:11,540
You know what, maybe this chest.

4509
06:19:12,540 --> 06:19:13,540
No, it's not.

4510
06:19:13,540 --> 06:19:15,540
Well, I'm not looting it then, go away.

4511
06:19:15,540 --> 06:19:18,540
I don't know what the heck the Charmin's Key is for.

4512
06:19:18,540 --> 06:19:21,540
Clap him, stinky lightning, honestly.

4513
06:19:21,540 --> 06:19:22,540
How do you come back from that?

4514
06:19:22,540 --> 06:19:25,540
Someone calls you stinky, you have no way of coming back, truly.

4515
06:19:25,540 --> 06:19:28,540
It's over for you, just admit it.

4516
06:19:28,540 --> 06:19:30,540
There's traps everywhere.

4517
06:19:30,540 --> 06:19:33,540
Isn't there a massive Centaurian coming up?

4518
06:19:33,540 --> 06:19:37,540
My brains just reminded me that there's a big enemy coming soon.

4519
06:19:40,540 --> 06:19:42,540
What does that say?

4520
06:19:42,540 --> 06:19:45,540
Bro, the game thinks I can read that?

4521
06:19:45,540 --> 06:19:47,540
Mercer, it's backwards!

4522
06:19:47,540 --> 06:19:50,540
Mercer is on the bottom.

4523
06:19:56,540 --> 06:19:58,540
Why is that backwards?

4524
06:19:58,540 --> 06:20:00,540
I can read Mercer as backwards.

4525
06:20:00,540 --> 06:20:02,540
I don't mind the stinky.

4526
06:20:02,540 --> 06:20:04,540
I don't mind the wires.

4527
06:20:04,540 --> 06:20:05,540
What, an air?

4528
06:20:05,540 --> 06:20:07,540
Why is it backwards?

4529
06:20:09,540 --> 06:20:12,540
I'll take these scrolls because I can sell them for money.

4530
06:20:18,540 --> 06:20:20,540
Let's go, let's go.

4531
06:20:23,540 --> 06:20:26,540
This is very real.

4532
06:20:29,540 --> 06:20:31,540
Oh, dear.

4533
06:20:31,540 --> 06:20:36,540
Right, can you jump the Centaurian and not me, maybe?

4534
06:20:36,540 --> 06:20:39,540
Oh, goodness, gravy.

4535
06:20:39,540 --> 06:20:44,540
Some of these enemies are my right fellows.

4536
06:20:44,540 --> 06:20:46,540
All my fellows.

4537
06:20:49,540 --> 06:20:51,540
Oh, hold on.

4538
06:20:51,540 --> 06:20:53,540
Hold on, right there you go.

4539
06:20:55,540 --> 06:20:57,540
Alright, I should probably go to sleep.

4540
06:20:57,540 --> 06:20:58,540
See you next time.

4541
06:20:58,540 --> 06:20:59,540
Rest well, those who sleep.

4542
06:20:59,540 --> 06:21:02,540
Please don't worry if you do need to go to sleep again.

4543
06:21:02,540 --> 06:21:08,540
But the cheeky endurance stream, Mercer is going live in T-minus less than three hours.

4544
06:21:08,540 --> 06:21:16,540
We're going to read Inter because my Skyrim escapades got cut short due to the fact that...

4545
06:21:16,540 --> 06:21:21,540
Oh, I am moving so fast I am successfully avoiding all the traps laid out.

4546
06:21:21,540 --> 06:21:26,540
Yes, I don't know why achievements aren't popping up.

4547
06:21:26,540 --> 06:21:32,540
I'm literally using Xbox Game Pass right now, so it's kind of the...

4548
06:21:32,540 --> 06:21:37,540
I'm not sure what the dealio is, but I'm quite happy just to play through the...

4549
06:21:39,540 --> 06:21:43,540
Thingamabobber and tomorrow's monetization celebration.

4550
06:21:46,540 --> 06:21:50,540
So I guess I can enjoy a more relaxed for my voice.

4551
06:21:50,540 --> 06:21:52,540
Oh, come on.

4552
06:21:54,540 --> 06:21:56,540
Oh, come on.

4553
06:21:56,540 --> 06:21:58,540
Get a rest.

4554
06:21:58,540 --> 06:21:59,540
Oh, I'm low health.

4555
06:21:59,540 --> 06:22:00,540
Oh, I'm low health.

4556
06:22:00,540 --> 06:22:02,540
I'm about to get altered by a spider.

4557
06:22:02,540 --> 06:22:03,540
Hold on.

4558
06:22:03,540 --> 06:22:05,540
Okay, there we go.

4559
06:22:07,540 --> 06:22:09,540
Go around to read it.

4560
06:22:10,540 --> 06:22:12,540
Go around it to read it.

4561
06:22:12,540 --> 06:22:17,540
Oh, is there like another room that makes a lot more sense if there was like something behind it?

4562
06:22:17,540 --> 06:22:21,540
Maybe I just ignored it and chose to be confused.

4563
06:22:22,540 --> 06:22:23,540
Oh, give me that.

4564
06:22:23,540 --> 06:22:25,540
Oh, orcishbowl and ice.

4565
06:22:25,540 --> 06:22:27,540
Oh, and alchemy.

4566
06:22:27,540 --> 06:22:29,540
Resurrect and restore my energy.

4567
06:22:35,540 --> 06:22:38,540
Alchemyxing like a creature.

4568
06:22:40,540 --> 06:22:43,540
Give me them juicy soul gems.

4569
06:22:43,540 --> 06:22:44,540
That's all I want.

4570
06:22:44,540 --> 06:22:45,540
That's all I crave.

4571
06:22:45,540 --> 06:22:47,540
I just want soul gems.

4572
06:22:49,540 --> 06:22:51,540
Oh, why don't I get one of you?

4573
06:22:51,540 --> 06:22:52,540
No.

4574
06:22:53,540 --> 06:22:54,540
Okay, okay, okay.

4575
06:22:55,540 --> 06:22:57,540
You guys don't need to perfectly follow me.

4576
06:22:57,540 --> 06:22:58,540
You do realize that, right?

4577
06:22:58,540 --> 06:22:59,540
But we can do this.

4578
06:23:00,540 --> 06:23:05,540
And we completely missed them because we alerted the enemies to our location.

4579
06:23:08,540 --> 06:23:09,540
Okay, there we go.

4580
06:23:09,540 --> 06:23:10,540
Oh my God, he's beat.

4581
06:23:10,540 --> 06:23:11,540
They're jumping me.

4582
06:23:13,540 --> 06:23:15,540
I'm actually beating that.

4583
06:23:15,540 --> 06:23:18,540
God, they have so much venom.

4584
06:23:19,540 --> 06:23:21,540
So much venom.

4585
06:23:22,540 --> 06:23:24,540
Don't mind if I do it.

4586
06:23:24,540 --> 06:23:27,540
Well, on earth where they do it, she be.

4587
06:23:27,540 --> 06:23:29,540
What have you been doing in your dungeon?

4588
06:23:29,540 --> 06:23:31,540
These last words?

4589
06:23:31,540 --> 06:23:32,540
Oh my God, that's brutal.

4590
06:23:32,540 --> 06:23:33,540
Hold on.

4591
06:23:34,540 --> 06:23:36,540
These last words.

4592
06:23:37,540 --> 06:23:39,540
Nobody thought they were real, but I've seen them.

4593
06:23:39,540 --> 06:23:41,540
The eyes of the snow elves.

4594
06:23:41,540 --> 06:23:43,540
The dwarves thought they looked...

4595
06:23:43,540 --> 06:23:46,540
The dwarves thought they took them from the Thammer,

4596
06:23:46,540 --> 06:23:47,540
but they themselves were fooled.

4597
06:23:47,540 --> 06:23:49,540
A statue built in secrecy by the slaves.

4598
06:23:50,540 --> 06:23:52,540
The eyes burn into you, and I see them.

4599
06:23:52,540 --> 06:23:55,540
Even the Seraphot escaped through the collapsing tunnel,

4600
06:23:55,540 --> 06:23:57,540
but he'll never escape what we've seen.

4601
06:23:57,540 --> 06:24:00,540
Men will never believe him, and he'll be driven mad by the knowledge

4602
06:24:00,540 --> 06:24:02,540
that he'll never see them again.

4603
06:24:02,540 --> 06:24:05,540
But I may yet see them again before I die.

4604
06:24:08,540 --> 06:24:10,540
Wow, that was strange.

4605
06:24:11,540 --> 06:24:13,540
Strawny's a soul gem addict.

4606
06:24:13,540 --> 06:24:16,540
Literally, they're like the most OP leveling up system.

4607
06:24:16,540 --> 06:24:17,540
I'm just gonna blast through this area

4608
06:24:17,540 --> 06:24:19,540
because there's a massive flamethrower, I think,

4609
06:24:19,540 --> 06:24:21,540
or something.

4610
06:24:26,540 --> 06:24:28,540
How am I detected if I'm around the corner?

4611
06:24:28,540 --> 06:24:30,540
Why are you going for me?

4612
06:24:30,540 --> 06:24:32,540
He's right there!

4613
06:24:35,540 --> 06:24:37,540
Literally, right in...

4614
06:24:37,540 --> 06:24:38,540
Actually, I just remembered,

4615
06:24:38,540 --> 06:24:40,540
Mercer drops are really good.

4616
06:24:40,540 --> 06:24:44,540
Two-handed sword, and we already got children.

4617
06:24:44,540 --> 06:24:47,540
Yeah, that's right. Spank that rat on the fire.

4618
06:24:52,540 --> 06:24:54,540
Oh, that's cool.

4619
06:24:59,540 --> 06:25:00,540
Oh, I'm getting...

4620
06:25:00,540 --> 06:25:03,540
Yeah, okay, I was gonna say I'm getting blasted by this.

4621
06:25:04,540 --> 06:25:07,540
We may yet to see Strawny's eyes before we die.

4622
06:25:10,540 --> 06:25:12,540
I might need to heal.

4623
06:25:14,540 --> 06:25:16,540
Or I might get away with it.

4624
06:25:20,540 --> 06:25:21,540
Ooh, we've been...

4625
06:25:21,540 --> 06:25:22,540
Oh, I got detected.

4626
06:25:22,540 --> 06:25:25,540
I keep going like, alright, I'll finally go sneak,

4627
06:25:25,540 --> 06:25:29,540
and then I get detected because I'm not paying attention.

4628
06:25:31,540 --> 06:25:33,540
Touch this.

4629
06:25:33,540 --> 06:25:35,540
Eat this.

4630
06:25:35,540 --> 06:25:37,540
Fun fact, the Dwemer nailed and scrolls are not doors,

4631
06:25:37,540 --> 06:25:39,540
but actually, a type of elf.

4632
06:25:39,540 --> 06:25:40,540
Two-handed.

4633
06:25:40,540 --> 06:25:42,540
He's in a drill wheel there.

4634
06:25:42,540 --> 06:25:44,540
Exactly.

4635
06:25:44,540 --> 06:25:46,540
Imagine not being a drill wheel there.

4636
06:25:46,540 --> 06:25:48,540
I can't relate.

4637
06:25:48,540 --> 06:25:51,540
I've tried so many times to be an archer,

4638
06:25:51,540 --> 06:25:53,540
but I just can't do it.

4639
06:25:53,540 --> 06:25:55,540
Like, especially when the enemy come up in your face

4640
06:25:55,540 --> 06:25:57,540
and you've got a bow and arrow,

4641
06:25:57,540 --> 06:26:00,540
it's like, bro, it wouldn't actually be so fero-fero.

4642
06:26:02,540 --> 06:26:05,540
I think that actually does more damage to the mother.

4643
06:26:07,540 --> 06:26:10,540
Wait, can I get them to deal with the enemies?

4644
06:26:10,540 --> 06:26:12,540
Oh my god, that's so cool.

4645
06:26:12,540 --> 06:26:14,540
I can like, go through here.

4646
06:26:14,540 --> 06:26:18,540
Is there like a treasure chest or something?

4647
06:26:18,540 --> 06:26:20,540
Or is this just like a...

4648
06:26:20,540 --> 06:26:22,540
Hurry up.

4649
06:26:22,540 --> 06:26:24,540
Wait, that symbol.

4650
06:26:24,540 --> 06:26:26,540
That means there's loot here?

4651
06:26:26,540 --> 06:26:28,540
I don't see no loot.

4652
06:26:28,540 --> 06:26:31,540
Or does it just mean that the thief's guild was here?

4653
06:26:35,540 --> 06:26:37,540
Okay.

4654
06:26:37,540 --> 06:26:39,540
I'm so confused.

4655
06:26:40,540 --> 06:26:43,540
I feel like there may have been something I missed,

4656
06:26:43,540 --> 06:26:45,540
but hey ho.

4657
06:26:46,540 --> 06:26:48,540
Alright, let's get to it.

4658
06:26:48,540 --> 06:26:50,540
Everybody get to it, to it.

4659
06:26:50,540 --> 06:26:52,540
Let's get this party started.

4660
06:26:52,540 --> 06:26:54,540
Let's get this bonus.

4661
06:26:54,540 --> 06:26:56,540
Departed.

4662
06:26:56,540 --> 06:26:58,540
Mercer was here.

4663
06:26:58,540 --> 06:27:00,540
Shield 100 is perfectly viable, thank you very much.

4664
06:27:00,540 --> 06:27:02,540
Probably.

4665
06:27:02,540 --> 06:27:04,540
What do they hold?

4666
06:27:04,540 --> 06:27:06,540
So they just kind of hold a lot of like, mix and stuff.

4667
06:27:06,540 --> 06:27:08,540
That's interesting.

4668
06:27:08,540 --> 06:27:11,540
They were more into like, the alchemy side of things.

4669
06:27:11,540 --> 06:27:13,540
Master lot?

4670
06:27:13,540 --> 06:27:15,540
Right, I'm not bothering.

4671
06:27:15,540 --> 06:27:17,540
So it's on your bike.

4672
06:27:20,540 --> 06:27:22,540
Hydration check.

4673
06:27:28,540 --> 06:27:30,540
Oh.

4674
06:27:30,540 --> 06:27:32,540
Wow.

4675
06:27:36,540 --> 06:27:38,540
Wow.

4676
06:27:46,540 --> 06:27:48,540
Such a shit.

4677
06:27:52,540 --> 06:27:54,540
Yeah, give me the key, Mercer.

4678
06:28:01,540 --> 06:28:03,540
The water's rising.

4679
06:28:15,540 --> 06:28:17,540
I don't believe you, no.

4680
06:28:17,540 --> 06:28:19,540
Turtle gates me, my new friend leaking.

4681
06:28:30,540 --> 06:28:32,540
Oh.

4682
06:28:32,540 --> 06:28:34,540
Dun dun dun.

4683
06:28:34,540 --> 06:28:37,540
The difference is, I still have honor.

4684
06:28:50,540 --> 06:28:54,540
If anyone falls, it'll be you, Mercer.

4685
06:29:00,540 --> 06:29:02,540
Nightingale.

4686
06:29:04,540 --> 06:29:09,540
I can't remember if this is hard or not.

4687
06:29:09,540 --> 06:29:11,540
Oh no, he got wallets.

4688
06:29:11,540 --> 06:29:13,540
Oh, he's got blood drain.

4689
06:29:15,540 --> 06:29:17,540
Oh my god.

4690
06:29:20,540 --> 06:29:21,540
Where is he?

4691
06:29:21,540 --> 06:29:23,540
I can just see the red doll.

4692
06:29:23,540 --> 06:29:25,540
I'm chasing the red doll.

4693
06:29:25,540 --> 06:29:27,540
There he is.

4694
06:29:27,540 --> 06:29:29,540
I found him.

4695
06:29:30,540 --> 06:29:31,540
I got him.

4696
06:29:31,540 --> 06:29:34,540
He's got, whoa, he's got like, yeah, I'll take all that.

4697
06:29:34,540 --> 06:29:36,540
Shit, give me everything.

4698
06:29:36,540 --> 06:29:39,540
Oh, I'm carrying too much to be able to run.

4699
06:29:39,540 --> 06:29:41,540
Oh, sorry, hold on.

4700
06:29:41,540 --> 06:29:46,540
Sorry, excuse me, just need to drop a few things that I don't need.

4701
06:29:46,540 --> 06:29:50,540
I don't need an embalming tool, I can show you that much.

4702
06:29:50,540 --> 06:29:54,540
Don't need random chunks of ore, that's fine.

4703
06:29:54,540 --> 06:29:56,540
A what?

4704
06:29:56,540 --> 06:29:58,540
It looks like a ship.

4705
06:29:58,540 --> 06:30:00,540
Is that a tap?

4706
06:30:00,540 --> 06:30:04,540
Yeah, don't need all these random miscellaneous things, that's fine.

4707
06:30:04,540 --> 06:30:08,540
Ingredients that could probably eat all the little ones

4708
06:30:08,540 --> 06:30:12,540
and clear up some side space stuff, I guess.

4709
06:30:12,540 --> 06:30:15,540
Unknown, unknown.

4710
06:30:15,540 --> 06:30:18,540
Sorry guys, I know the cave is collapsing, it's very important.

4711
06:30:18,540 --> 06:30:22,540
I have a little taste test of all these ingredients, I assure you.

4712
06:30:22,540 --> 06:30:25,540
Food, yeah, sure, let's just freaking load up.

4713
06:30:25,540 --> 06:30:27,540
Am I light yet?

4714
06:30:27,540 --> 06:30:30,540
No, I'm not light yet, holy crap.

4715
06:30:30,540 --> 06:30:33,540
Okay, right, what do we not need?

4716
06:30:33,540 --> 06:30:36,540
That does say 26, not gonna lie.

4717
06:30:36,540 --> 06:30:39,540
Oh, I forgot to...

4718
06:30:39,540 --> 06:30:41,540
That one's better.

4719
06:30:41,540 --> 06:30:46,540
I don't want to drop it though, I feel like I can sell it for decent money, honestly.

4720
06:30:46,540 --> 06:30:51,540
I guess we'll just drop that shit.

4721
06:30:51,540 --> 06:30:54,540
Orcishbowl, 11.

4722
06:30:54,540 --> 06:30:57,540
Please don't really give me much money.

4723
06:30:57,540 --> 06:31:00,540
Okay, so don't panic.

4724
06:31:00,540 --> 06:31:03,540
I know the cave is literally...

4725
06:31:03,540 --> 06:31:08,540
Oh, I know the cave is like perishing and it's falling with war,

4726
06:31:08,540 --> 06:31:12,540
but don't panic guys, everything is okay, alright?

4727
06:31:12,540 --> 06:31:14,540
You just have to let it fill.

4728
06:31:14,540 --> 06:31:18,540
Oh, oh he hit the quaw.

4729
06:31:19,540 --> 06:31:22,540
Oh, are you guys okay? Do you guys need to breathe? No?

4730
06:31:22,540 --> 06:31:25,540
No, you don't need to breathe? Okay, you don't have to.

4731
06:31:25,540 --> 06:31:35,540
If you look above the head of the elf, you'll notice those rocks look very suspiciously movable.

4732
06:31:35,540 --> 06:31:40,540
That's because they are, you have a keen eye, refling, you have a keen eye.

4733
06:31:41,540 --> 06:31:47,540
I'm strong enough to taste test all the new alchemy ingredients,

4734
06:31:47,540 --> 06:31:51,540
literally like trying to like release some of the weight in my inventory,

4735
06:31:51,540 --> 06:31:57,540
and I'm like, hmm, yes, hmm, this moth wings though, what a delicacy.

4736
06:31:57,540 --> 06:32:01,540
You just have to wait, unfortunately you can't like swim upwards,

4737
06:32:01,540 --> 06:32:06,540
it doesn't do it the way you want it to, so it's a bit awkward.

4738
06:32:06,540 --> 06:32:08,540
But yeah.

4739
06:32:08,540 --> 06:32:12,540
I remember the first place where I was trying to like swim through these pipes,

4740
06:32:12,540 --> 06:32:16,540
I was like, yes, the pipes, the pipes will save me.

4741
06:32:16,540 --> 06:32:19,540
But it should do one big collapse.

4742
06:32:19,540 --> 06:32:22,540
There you go.

4743
06:32:22,540 --> 06:32:25,540
Pick it long enough, honestly.

4744
06:32:25,540 --> 06:32:31,540
And then you just gotta wait until it gets high enough to get up there.

4745
06:32:31,540 --> 06:32:34,540
To shift the weight in my body eats 50 cheese wheels.

4746
06:32:34,540 --> 06:32:36,540
We are aquatic.

4747
06:32:36,540 --> 06:32:38,540
Let me see some tools.

4748
06:32:38,540 --> 06:32:41,540
Stopping to release, yes sir.

4749
06:32:41,540 --> 06:32:45,540
But as faster you get out of that cave, the easier the game.

4750
06:32:51,540 --> 06:32:56,540
I have completely forgotten how much the NPCs love to talk to you.

4751
06:32:56,540 --> 06:32:58,540
No.

4752
06:32:58,540 --> 06:33:00,540
Five years.

4753
06:33:01,540 --> 06:33:04,540
No, Carlisle.

4754
06:33:09,540 --> 06:33:11,540
It's not simple.

4755
06:33:14,540 --> 06:33:17,540
Sepucar, I've never said sepucar.

4756
06:33:20,540 --> 06:33:24,540
Are you ready to take a pilgrimage together?

4757
06:33:26,540 --> 06:33:29,540
We can serve nocturnal in other ways.

4758
06:33:29,540 --> 06:33:33,540
As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing.

4759
06:33:33,540 --> 06:33:36,540
Then we'd best get started.

4760
06:33:36,540 --> 06:33:40,540
We don't need it back if a thief's going to keep order while you're away.

4761
06:33:40,540 --> 06:33:46,540
And I can't bear to face nocturnal, I don't need to protect the king.

4762
06:33:46,540 --> 06:33:49,540
I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.

4763
06:33:49,540 --> 06:33:52,540
Okay, we can do it alone. We're big boys and girls.

4764
06:33:52,540 --> 06:33:54,540
Take this with you.

4765
06:33:54,540 --> 06:33:56,540
Help within the walls of the sepucar.

4766
06:33:56,540 --> 06:33:59,540
Oh, she gives me her bow.

4767
06:34:03,540 --> 06:34:05,540
Oh.

4768
06:34:07,540 --> 06:34:09,540
Okay, I'm actually hitting it.

4769
06:34:09,540 --> 06:34:11,540
Sorry, last round. Okay, you can't talk to me.

4770
06:34:11,540 --> 06:34:14,540
Ow, I just got blammed by that skull.

4771
06:34:14,540 --> 06:34:16,540
I literally yanked the HP off me.

4772
06:34:16,540 --> 06:34:19,540
Can we serve Strony in other ways?

4773
06:34:19,540 --> 06:34:21,540
Absolutely.

4774
06:34:22,540 --> 06:34:25,540
It depends what you're offering is to me.

4775
06:34:27,540 --> 06:34:31,540
Aw, I've not even been a folk wreath yet.

4776
06:34:33,540 --> 06:34:39,540
Actually, you know what? I need to destroy and enchant a few things to sell on.

4777
06:34:39,540 --> 06:34:43,540
So I'm going to go do that now and it will free up a lot of inventory.

4778
06:34:43,540 --> 06:34:46,540
Is Carlisle the same VA as Shadowheart?

4779
06:34:46,540 --> 06:34:48,540
I cannot tell you that. I don't know.

4780
06:34:48,540 --> 06:34:51,540
Well, there's gates such good reviews, though,

4781
06:34:51,540 --> 06:34:54,540
that I'm really tempted to play it for the first time on stream,

4782
06:34:54,540 --> 06:34:57,540
but I'm worried in case I'm so dumb I can't figure it out,

4783
06:34:57,540 --> 06:35:01,540
but hopefully it's a full-proof game like anyone can just jump in on the fun.

4784
06:35:01,540 --> 06:35:03,540
Right, this is what I want.

4785
06:35:04,540 --> 06:35:08,540
Devouring, archery and potions.

4786
06:35:08,540 --> 06:35:11,540
Everything else can be sold. You heard it here first.

4787
06:35:14,540 --> 06:35:17,540
Did I even have a big gem?

4788
06:35:18,540 --> 06:35:20,540
I do.

4789
06:35:20,540 --> 06:35:23,540
Yes. Did I make it craft?

4790
06:35:23,540 --> 06:35:25,540
Yes.

4791
06:35:25,540 --> 06:35:27,540
That was bloody good shoe.

4792
06:35:27,540 --> 06:35:29,540
That bloody good shoe.

4793
06:35:29,540 --> 06:35:31,540
Right, where's that?

4794
06:35:31,540 --> 06:35:36,540
So what? Just enchant random stuff now for the XP, I guess?

4795
06:35:36,540 --> 06:35:39,540
Turn undead. Frost damage here, why not?

4796
06:35:39,540 --> 06:35:41,540
Petty Soul Gem.

4797
06:35:41,540 --> 06:35:44,540
Yeah, I'm just going to put Petty Soul Gem stuff on it.

4798
06:35:45,540 --> 06:35:47,540
Uh-uh.

4799
06:35:47,540 --> 06:35:50,540
And then I know I can sell everything in my inventory.

4800
06:35:50,540 --> 06:35:53,540
God, look at the level up. It's so fast.

4801
06:35:53,540 --> 06:35:56,540
The game is so forgiven.

4802
06:36:01,540 --> 06:36:03,540
Just the noise.

4803
06:36:04,540 --> 06:36:07,540
It's just constantly like...

4804
06:36:08,540 --> 06:36:13,540
We'll put all of this stuff on and then we can get a pretty penny.

4805
06:36:13,540 --> 06:36:15,540
Oh, we might be able to buy the home.

4806
06:36:15,540 --> 06:36:18,540
We might be able to buy our home in Riften.

4807
06:36:19,540 --> 06:36:23,540
And then we can have our little flower garden out in front.

4808
06:36:24,540 --> 06:36:27,540
We can't get chickens though. Not yet.

4809
06:36:27,540 --> 06:36:30,540
Baldur's Gate 3 is good and you can do whatever you want.

4810
06:36:30,540 --> 06:36:32,540
It's not really wrong way of playing it.

4811
06:36:32,540 --> 06:36:34,540
Baldur's Gate is really open and rewarding.

4812
06:36:34,540 --> 06:36:36,540
I'm glad.

4813
06:36:37,540 --> 06:36:39,540
Um...

4814
06:36:41,540 --> 06:36:43,540
I can't figure it out.

4815
06:36:43,540 --> 06:36:47,540
Also tells us, please backseat me. You'll be fine.

4816
06:36:47,540 --> 06:36:52,540
Yeah, some folk really are so strongly like a little bit backseat gaming.

4817
06:36:52,540 --> 06:36:56,540
I'm actually going to travel to Riften just to sell some stuff

4818
06:36:56,540 --> 06:36:58,540
because my inventory is getting a bit too full.

4819
06:36:58,540 --> 06:37:03,540
Now, as much as I like being full and, you know, a bandaid slapped on top

4820
06:37:03,540 --> 06:37:05,540
Not like this.

4821
06:37:14,540 --> 06:37:18,540
I would like to sell some weapons that are very heavy.

4822
06:37:21,540 --> 06:37:24,540
I will keep children. I'll put it elsewhere.

4823
06:37:28,540 --> 06:37:30,540
I don't want to sell that stuff.

4824
06:37:30,540 --> 06:37:32,540
I'd rather keep it.

4825
06:37:32,540 --> 06:37:36,540
I can sell, like, all of it, right? You're out of money.

4826
06:37:38,540 --> 06:37:40,540
I will remember that.

4827
06:37:43,540 --> 06:37:45,540
You can marry the butcher.

4828
06:37:45,540 --> 06:37:47,540
He's not a butcher. He's a blacksmith.

4829
06:37:47,540 --> 06:37:49,540
Those wires are really crossed on me.

4830
06:37:49,540 --> 06:37:56,540
Please take some of my stuff that I don't need.

4831
06:37:56,540 --> 06:37:58,540
Thanks. Appreciate it.

4832
06:37:59,540 --> 06:38:02,540
Created potions are 1% more strong.

4833
06:38:02,540 --> 06:38:05,540
Wait, no, actually, I'm going to keep the diamonds and stuff on me.

4834
06:38:05,540 --> 06:38:12,540
The reason for that is because you can get, like, miscellaneous quests to ask for that basic stuff.

4835
06:38:12,540 --> 06:38:14,540
How about you?

4836
06:38:16,540 --> 06:38:18,540
Everything I've got on display, really.

4837
06:38:18,540 --> 06:38:22,540
We're going to get rid of all this. This should really lighten the load.

4838
06:38:23,540 --> 06:38:26,540
I don't want to sell that thing.

4839
06:38:26,540 --> 06:38:29,540
Oh, I completely forgot I have, like, golders.

4840
06:38:31,540 --> 06:38:34,540
That must be... Oh, he's not going to gold left.

4841
06:38:34,540 --> 06:38:35,540
Oops.

4842
06:38:35,540 --> 06:38:37,540
Oops, I'm giving away things for free.

4843
06:38:37,540 --> 06:38:38,540
Oopsies.

4844
06:38:38,540 --> 06:38:39,540
Oopsies, tee-hee.

4845
06:38:39,540 --> 06:38:40,540
Little tee-hee moment.

4846
06:38:40,540 --> 06:38:43,540
Right, we'll go Falkreath, and then we'll hit up Twilight's.

4847
06:38:43,540 --> 06:38:45,540
I love her.

4848
06:38:45,540 --> 06:38:48,540
Strangely, I will remember everything you said.

4849
06:38:48,540 --> 06:38:51,540
Fair enough. I don't even know what to say half the time.

4850
06:38:51,540 --> 06:38:52,540
I'm just here for a good time.

4851
06:38:52,540 --> 06:38:55,540
Do you remember when we almost got our heads chopped off?

4852
06:38:55,540 --> 06:38:57,540
Yeah, and I was taken over by bandits and burnt tickers.

4853
06:38:57,540 --> 06:39:00,540
Tee-hee, not my problem. Tee-hee.

4854
06:39:02,540 --> 06:39:06,540
Stony, ever dropped a bunch of jewelry in the shopping centre in Riften?

4855
06:39:06,540 --> 06:39:10,540
Everyone starts fighting over stuff you drop,

4856
06:39:10,540 --> 06:39:13,540
and, like, it literally terminates NPCs, and it's like,

4857
06:39:13,540 --> 06:39:15,540
I've need them for quests.

4858
06:39:15,540 --> 06:39:19,540
That's the one thing I could absolutely obliterate Skyrim for,

4859
06:39:19,540 --> 06:39:24,540
is if a quest requires an NPC,

4860
06:39:24,540 --> 06:39:27,540
do not let them be perishable.

4861
06:39:27,540 --> 06:39:29,540
Do not let them expire.

4862
06:39:29,540 --> 06:39:31,540
I am so sad.

4863
06:39:31,540 --> 06:39:33,540
What the heck is...

4864
06:39:33,540 --> 06:39:36,540
Oh, no!

4865
06:39:38,540 --> 06:39:41,540
The wolves jumped these poor people,

4866
06:39:41,540 --> 06:39:44,540
and the one wolf perished them both.

4867
06:39:46,540 --> 06:39:48,540
Mmm.

4868
06:39:48,540 --> 06:39:52,540
That's what you get for trying to execute an innocent dragonborn.

4869
06:39:52,540 --> 06:39:54,540
Some of them are marchers,

4870
06:39:54,540 --> 06:39:57,540
and some NPCs can't be perishable,

4871
06:39:57,540 --> 06:39:59,540
but if they have a quest,

4872
06:39:59,540 --> 06:40:01,540
I feel like they shouldn't be able to expire at all,

4873
06:40:01,540 --> 06:40:04,540
because it's so annoying when you're trying to do it,

4874
06:40:04,540 --> 06:40:06,540
and then it's like, oh, surprise, by the way.

4875
06:40:06,540 --> 06:40:08,540
Oh, who are you? Hello.

4876
06:40:09,540 --> 06:40:11,540
What's a milk drinker like you doing out here?

4877
06:40:11,540 --> 06:40:13,540
Go home to your mother.

4878
06:40:39,540 --> 06:40:44,540
Yeah, I'm starting to think we're getting, like, absolutely nothing done.

4879
06:40:44,540 --> 06:40:47,540
We're pretty much looking at T-minus two hours.

4880
06:40:47,540 --> 06:40:49,540
I've been live for almost seven hours.

4881
06:40:49,540 --> 06:40:51,540
I've yet to finish the quest.

4882
06:40:52,540 --> 06:40:54,540
Eh, right. Fault creases here.

4883
06:40:55,540 --> 06:40:57,540
What the heck is that?

4884
06:40:59,540 --> 06:41:00,540
Bro!

4885
06:41:00,540 --> 06:41:03,540
You can not drop rocks on people's heads.

4886
06:41:03,540 --> 06:41:06,540
I cannot tell you how inappropriate that is.

4887
06:41:07,540 --> 06:41:08,540
Um...

4888
06:41:09,540 --> 06:41:12,540
I am home with my mommy.

4889
06:41:12,540 --> 06:41:15,540
We drink milk and tea up in this place, of course.

4890
06:41:18,540 --> 06:41:20,540
Literally, how have I been at this for seven hours?

4891
06:41:20,540 --> 06:41:22,540
I'm not completed one quest.

4892
06:41:22,540 --> 06:41:24,540
Something's not adding up. I don't know.

4893
06:41:24,540 --> 06:41:28,540
Like, I'm pretty sure the Skyrim World record is, like, two hours.

4894
06:41:28,540 --> 06:41:31,540
Like, one hour and 52 minutes or something.

4895
06:41:31,540 --> 06:41:33,540
Ridiculous, like that.

4896
06:41:33,540 --> 06:41:36,540
And you're telling me in seven hours,

4897
06:41:36,540 --> 06:41:39,540
near seven hours, I couldn't finish one quest line.

4898
06:41:42,540 --> 06:41:45,540
Well, I need sleep. Good night. Thank you for hanging.

4899
06:41:45,540 --> 06:41:47,540
No promises, I won't see you in my dreams.

4900
06:41:47,540 --> 06:41:50,540
That's right. Get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish.

4901
06:41:50,540 --> 06:41:52,540
Your only dream of a Scottish.

4902
06:41:53,540 --> 06:41:56,540
The Highland Cows call you.

4903
06:41:59,540 --> 06:42:01,540
Ooh, I don't want to walk over a grave.

4904
06:42:01,540 --> 06:42:03,540
That's bad luck.

4905
06:42:03,540 --> 06:42:06,540
That's a lot of graves. What's going on in full graves?

4906
06:42:06,540 --> 06:42:08,540
I feel like that's probably a quest, cause...

4907
06:42:09,540 --> 06:42:10,540
That's a lot.

4908
06:42:11,540 --> 06:42:12,540
Scotland!

4909
06:42:12,540 --> 06:42:14,540
Forever!

4910
06:42:18,540 --> 06:42:20,540
Get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish.

4911
06:42:20,540 --> 06:42:21,540
I think I need to do that.

4912
06:42:21,540 --> 06:42:22,540
Someone did that where I was like,

4913
06:42:22,540 --> 06:42:24,540
get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant.

4914
06:42:24,540 --> 06:42:25,540
And it's like, dang, dang, dang.

4915
06:42:25,540 --> 06:42:27,540
Like, really intense music.

4916
06:42:27,540 --> 06:42:30,540
I want to do that, but like, get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish.

4917
06:42:32,540 --> 06:42:34,540
We're almost there.

4918
06:42:34,540 --> 06:42:36,540
We're almost there, we're almost there.

4919
06:42:36,540 --> 06:42:38,540
We just got to run a little bit longer.

4920
06:42:41,540 --> 06:42:43,540
Oh, there's castles and ruins.

4921
06:42:44,540 --> 06:42:48,540
Did you know you can just straight up buy castles in Scotland?

4922
06:42:48,540 --> 06:42:50,540
Fun fact, you can literally look up them online.

4923
06:42:50,540 --> 06:42:52,540
Just type in Castle for sale in Scotland.

4924
06:42:52,540 --> 06:42:54,540
I'm not even kidding.

4925
06:42:55,540 --> 06:42:58,540
It's pretty intense and cool.

4926
06:42:59,540 --> 06:43:01,540
And you can buy churches.

4927
06:43:01,540 --> 06:43:03,540
It's a lot cheaper to live in a church.

4928
06:43:03,540 --> 06:43:05,540
An ex-church, by the way.

4929
06:43:05,540 --> 06:43:08,540
You can literally, it's like, churches for sale in Scotland.

4930
06:43:08,540 --> 06:43:09,540
Yeah, just have a look.

4931
06:43:09,540 --> 06:43:11,540
It's like, way cheaper.

4932
06:43:13,540 --> 06:43:17,540
Johnny, have you heard of the Scott Wikipedia vandalism story?

4933
06:43:17,540 --> 06:43:18,540
Yes!

4934
06:43:18,540 --> 06:43:20,540
Oh, we should talk about it.

4935
06:43:20,540 --> 06:43:23,540
Like, if you didn't know.

4936
06:43:23,540 --> 06:43:26,540
So, Scots is basically slang.

4937
06:43:26,540 --> 06:43:29,540
And we say things very phonetically.

4938
06:43:29,540 --> 06:43:31,540
And someone...

4939
06:43:32,540 --> 06:43:35,540
Whoa, wait, I didn't realise you were a bandit.

4940
06:43:35,540 --> 06:43:36,540
Sorry.

4941
06:43:36,540 --> 06:43:38,540
Time to go, buddy.

4942
06:43:41,540 --> 06:43:43,540
And someone basically went,

4943
06:43:43,540 --> 06:43:46,540
Oh, I'll just rewrite this in Scots.

4944
06:43:46,540 --> 06:43:49,540
But he, like, wasn't Scottish.

4945
06:43:49,540 --> 06:43:53,540
So he just wrote what he thought, like, Scottish folks said.

4946
06:43:53,540 --> 06:43:55,540
And it was just complete gibberish.

4947
06:43:55,540 --> 06:43:58,540
And he'd been doing it for ages and no one, like, caught him.

4948
06:43:58,540 --> 06:44:00,540
Wasn't that it?

4949
06:44:01,540 --> 06:44:05,540
He sent in Zillow to Scotland to find an affordable hoose, honestly.

4950
06:44:07,540 --> 06:44:08,540
It's Gallus!

4951
06:44:08,540 --> 06:44:09,540
Hello.

4952
06:44:09,540 --> 06:44:11,540
Hello, Gallus.

4953
06:44:18,540 --> 06:44:20,540
I visited Edinburgh.

4954
06:44:20,540 --> 06:44:21,540
Let's go.

4955
06:44:21,540 --> 06:44:23,540
I'd asked the same question.

4956
06:44:24,540 --> 06:44:25,540
That's really funny.

4957
06:44:25,540 --> 06:44:28,540
Stony's gonna buy a castle, move the wheeler team into it,

4958
06:44:28,540 --> 06:44:30,540
then get Reeflands to serve them there.

4959
06:44:30,540 --> 06:44:32,540
But could you imagine, though?

4960
06:44:32,540 --> 06:44:33,540
Like, oh!

4961
06:44:33,540 --> 06:44:36,540
You know what, you get out of this exchange?

4962
06:44:36,540 --> 06:44:38,540
A servitude!

4963
06:44:41,540 --> 06:44:43,540
How are you to blame?

4964
06:44:50,540 --> 06:44:52,540
Where can I say no?

4965
06:44:54,540 --> 06:44:57,540
Wait a minute, you're Gallus!

4966
06:45:03,540 --> 06:45:06,540
I'm best pals with your girlfriend.

4967
06:45:13,540 --> 06:45:15,540
How do you say I love you in Scottish?

4968
06:45:15,540 --> 06:45:17,540
It's just I love you.

4969
06:45:18,540 --> 06:45:22,540
Like, I love you, and then I love you.

4970
06:45:23,540 --> 06:45:26,540
It's kind of, like, shoved together in fast.

4971
06:45:26,540 --> 06:45:28,540
He's that adoring fan.

4972
06:45:28,540 --> 06:45:29,540
Is he?

4973
06:45:30,540 --> 06:45:32,540
By Azura, by Azura, by Azura.

4974
06:45:32,540 --> 06:45:34,540
I did this for Nocturo.

4975
06:45:34,540 --> 06:45:36,540
I did this for the honour of the guild.

4976
06:45:41,540 --> 06:45:43,540
Carlaya helped me.

4977
06:45:45,540 --> 06:45:47,540
Yes, your girlfriend's alive.

4978
06:45:53,540 --> 06:45:55,540
Well, then she would have appeared here.

4979
06:45:55,540 --> 06:45:58,540
Then take the key and right all the wrongs.

4980
06:46:04,540 --> 06:46:06,540
When we put Stony as our cult leader,

4981
06:46:06,540 --> 06:46:08,540
we could cut taxes and save money!

4982
06:46:08,540 --> 06:46:09,540
Yay!

4983
06:46:11,540 --> 06:46:13,540
We can be tax exempt together.

4984
06:46:13,540 --> 06:46:14,540
Yippee!

4985
06:46:15,540 --> 06:46:17,540
How can a spirit die?

4986
06:46:24,540 --> 06:46:26,540
The Ebeneer?

4987
06:46:26,540 --> 06:46:28,540
A bit of Ebeneer?

4988
06:46:35,540 --> 06:46:39,540
Maintaining a historical site for tax breaks and profit?

4989
06:46:39,540 --> 06:46:42,540
Yeah, and then we run like a massive B&B over.

4990
06:46:42,540 --> 06:46:43,540
Oh my god.

4991
06:46:44,540 --> 06:46:46,540
I'm afraid so.

4992
06:46:46,540 --> 06:46:47,540
I'm weakening.

4993
06:46:47,540 --> 06:46:50,540
And I can feel myself slipping away.

4994
06:46:50,540 --> 06:46:52,540
The gears without restoration of my power

4995
06:46:52,540 --> 06:46:53,540
I had to take.

4996
06:46:53,540 --> 06:46:54,540
That's taken.

4997
06:46:54,540 --> 06:46:56,540
You really want to mess with the IRS?

4998
06:46:56,540 --> 06:46:58,540
That should be a song.

4999
06:46:58,540 --> 06:47:00,540
You really want to mess with the IRS?

5000
06:47:01,540 --> 06:47:05,540
I fought the law in the law one.

5001
06:47:05,540 --> 06:47:07,540
Ray.

5002
06:47:09,540 --> 06:47:10,540
Good luck, Gallus.

5003
06:47:10,540 --> 06:47:12,540
Even though you don't have to do anything.

5004
06:47:13,540 --> 06:47:15,540
I don't mind doing the hard work, right?

5005
06:47:15,540 --> 06:47:16,540
Who needs a bashing?

5006
06:47:17,540 --> 06:47:18,540
Who needs a bashing?

5007
06:47:18,540 --> 06:47:19,540
Who's begging for the pagan?

5008
06:47:19,540 --> 06:47:20,540
Because it's all happening at once.

5009
06:47:20,540 --> 06:47:21,540
Let's go!

5010
06:47:21,540 --> 06:47:22,540
I bet he do.

5011
06:47:23,540 --> 06:47:24,540
Beat him up! Beat him up! Beat him up!

5012
06:47:24,540 --> 06:47:25,540
Beat him up! Beat him up!

5013
06:47:27,540 --> 06:47:29,540
Oh wow, they're actually kind of beef.

5014
06:47:30,540 --> 06:47:33,540
They're actually a bit stronger than your average enemy.

5015
06:47:33,540 --> 06:47:34,540
Hold on a minute.

5016
06:47:34,540 --> 06:47:35,540
I don't like that.

5017
06:47:36,540 --> 06:47:37,540
You, come here.

5018
06:47:37,540 --> 06:47:38,540
No, I'm stuck on the stairs.

5019
06:47:38,540 --> 06:47:39,540
Hold on.

5020
06:47:39,540 --> 06:47:40,540
I'm stuck on...

5021
06:47:41,540 --> 06:47:42,540
I'm stuck on...

5022
06:47:42,540 --> 06:47:43,540
Ow! Ow! Stop!

5023
06:47:43,540 --> 06:47:45,540
Swap to weapon, Ray!

5024
06:47:45,540 --> 06:47:46,540
Stop to melee!

5025
06:47:46,540 --> 06:47:47,540
Yes, there you go.

5026
06:47:47,540 --> 06:47:48,540
Okay, there we go.

5027
06:47:48,540 --> 06:47:50,540
Jeez, I lose.

5028
06:47:51,540 --> 06:47:52,540
What is in you?

5029
06:47:53,540 --> 06:47:54,540
Arrows?

5030
06:47:55,540 --> 06:47:56,540
So, Jim!

5031
06:47:57,540 --> 06:47:58,540
Alchemy.

5032
06:48:00,540 --> 06:48:03,540
Totally not secret backtracking.

5033
06:48:03,540 --> 06:48:05,540
I do love Skyrim for that.

5034
06:48:05,540 --> 06:48:07,540
It's quite rather entertaining.

5035
06:48:07,540 --> 06:48:11,540
Okay, they've got elven arrows on their persons, which is pretty...

5036
06:48:15,540 --> 06:48:17,540
Oh, why are you so scary?

5037
06:48:20,540 --> 06:48:21,540
I'm not gonna lie.

5038
06:48:21,540 --> 06:48:23,540
Like, they're kind of messing me up now.

5039
06:48:24,540 --> 06:48:26,540
Open our own velar colony?

5040
06:48:27,540 --> 06:48:28,540
What?

5041
06:48:28,540 --> 06:48:32,540
In the Scottish countryside with crops and feudal lordship for the grove?

5042
06:48:32,540 --> 06:48:33,540
Bruh!

5043
06:48:35,540 --> 06:48:38,540
Look, sometimes a sense of community is all you need if...

5044
06:48:38,540 --> 06:48:39,540
Oh!

5045
06:48:39,540 --> 06:48:41,540
Wait, I'm to stay in the dark.

5046
06:48:42,540 --> 06:48:45,540
Right, if you stay in the dark, your health doesn't get...

5047
06:48:48,540 --> 06:48:50,540
Well, wasn't he paying attention to that?

5048
06:48:50,540 --> 06:48:51,540
Was he?

5049
06:48:51,540 --> 06:48:52,540
Clearly, no.

5050
06:48:53,540 --> 06:48:56,540
Yeah, you just need to stay in the dark so you don't get hurt in this section.

5051
06:48:56,540 --> 06:48:58,540
It's not really too bad at all.

5052
06:48:58,540 --> 06:49:00,540
I just can't see nothing in it at all.

5053
06:49:01,540 --> 06:49:02,540
Oh!

5054
06:49:02,540 --> 06:49:05,540
Just a wee bit of poison, just a few darts in my eyeballs.

5055
06:49:05,540 --> 06:49:06,540
It's fine, it's fine.

5056
06:49:06,540 --> 06:49:08,540
I can still see for the most part.

5057
06:49:09,540 --> 06:49:10,540
Wish I wore my glasses.

5058
06:49:18,540 --> 06:49:19,540
My lady!

5059
06:49:20,540 --> 06:49:21,540
Hello!

5060
06:49:22,540 --> 06:49:25,540
Oh, a bandit got all the way here.

5061
06:49:26,540 --> 06:49:27,540
Hello, my lady!

5062
06:49:27,540 --> 06:49:30,540
Please ignore the fact that I'm taking your offering.

5063
06:49:30,540 --> 06:49:32,540
So fragmented, I don't need that.

5064
06:49:33,540 --> 06:49:36,540
Uh, uh, behind here is two chains to pull.

5065
06:49:37,540 --> 06:49:38,540
Gammy!

5066
06:49:40,540 --> 06:49:41,540
Atlas!

5067
06:49:42,540 --> 06:49:43,540
Where's Blossom?

5068
06:49:44,540 --> 06:49:45,540
Where's Gammy?

5069
06:49:45,540 --> 06:49:49,540
That's Gammy, the girl, and that's her dad, Atlas.

5070
06:49:49,540 --> 06:49:51,540
And Blossom's her mummy.

5071
06:49:52,540 --> 06:49:53,540
Hmm.

5072
06:49:53,540 --> 06:49:55,540
Is it true if you buy land in Skull, you become a lord?

5073
06:49:55,540 --> 06:49:58,540
No, that is completely false.

5074
06:49:58,540 --> 06:50:03,540
Um, if you take that in, by the way, you'll actually...

5075
06:50:04,540 --> 06:50:05,540
Um...

5076
06:50:09,540 --> 06:50:10,540
I knew...

5077
06:50:10,540 --> 06:50:12,540
Ow!

5078
06:50:12,540 --> 06:50:14,540
Oh my god, I just got reeled by a log.

5079
06:50:14,540 --> 06:50:16,540
That wasn't really that fun, I'm gonna be honest.

5080
06:50:18,540 --> 06:50:19,540
Wait, we did it, we did it.

5081
06:50:19,540 --> 06:50:20,540
We're here, we're here.

5082
06:50:20,540 --> 06:50:22,540
Snowberry's waiting on Icey's every need,

5083
06:50:22,540 --> 06:50:24,540
Penpal's being picked for a set of me.

5084
06:50:27,540 --> 06:50:30,540
Oh, it's all spooky, it's all spooky and purple.

5085
06:50:32,540 --> 06:50:34,540
Oh, I love the color scheme.

5086
06:50:36,540 --> 06:50:38,540
Oh, I remember this.

5087
06:50:41,540 --> 06:50:43,540
Oh no, I'm stuck.

5088
06:50:45,540 --> 06:50:46,540
I should read his note.

5089
06:50:47,540 --> 06:50:48,540
Anderson's...

5090
06:50:48,540 --> 06:50:49,540
Anderson's message.

5091
06:51:07,540 --> 06:51:08,540
I don't think he made it, chief.

5092
06:51:08,540 --> 06:51:09,540
I don't think he made it.

5093
06:51:09,540 --> 06:51:10,540
Yeah.

5094
06:51:11,540 --> 06:51:12,540
Uh...

5095
06:51:13,540 --> 06:51:15,540
If only we had some sort of...

5096
06:51:16,540 --> 06:51:17,540
Key?

5097
06:51:18,540 --> 06:51:21,540
Some sort of skeleton...

5098
06:51:22,540 --> 06:51:23,540
Key?

5099
06:51:23,540 --> 06:51:24,540
Yep.

5100
06:51:38,540 --> 06:51:39,540
Oh, I'm stuck.

5101
06:51:40,540 --> 06:51:41,540
I got...

5102
06:51:46,540 --> 06:51:47,540
Oh, that's...

5103
06:51:47,540 --> 06:51:48,540
Gammies!

5104
06:51:48,540 --> 06:51:50,540
Look at all Gammie's babies!

5105
06:51:50,540 --> 06:51:51,540
Oh, I'm in the wrong way.

5106
06:51:51,540 --> 06:51:52,540
Sorry, Hen.

5107
06:51:57,540 --> 06:52:00,540
Tell me that ain't good design.

5108
06:52:01,540 --> 06:52:04,540
Excuse me, we'll stay a little around.

5109
06:52:05,540 --> 06:52:06,540
Oh yeah.

5110
06:52:06,540 --> 06:52:07,540
Yeah.

5111
06:52:08,540 --> 06:52:09,540
Oh yeah.

5112
06:52:16,540 --> 06:52:17,540
Oh yeah.

5113
06:52:29,540 --> 06:52:32,540
Nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.

5114
06:52:33,540 --> 06:52:36,540
We must stay focused, Reeflings.

5115
06:52:36,540 --> 06:52:38,540
We must stay focused.

5116
06:53:03,540 --> 06:53:04,540
Oh no.

5117
06:53:08,540 --> 06:53:09,540
Wow!

5118
06:53:09,540 --> 06:53:10,540
Drink?

5119
06:53:20,540 --> 06:53:21,540
Bye-bye, mommy!

5120
06:53:21,540 --> 06:53:22,540
Bye-bye, mommy!

5121
06:53:28,540 --> 06:53:30,540
Where did you come from?

5122
06:53:30,540 --> 06:53:31,540
Hello.

5123
06:53:31,540 --> 06:53:32,540
Oh, sorry.

5124
06:53:33,540 --> 06:53:34,540
Oh, sorry.

5125
06:53:34,540 --> 06:53:35,540
Oh, sorry.

5126
06:53:36,540 --> 06:53:37,540
Can I talk to you now?

5127
06:53:39,540 --> 06:53:40,540
Yes.

5128
06:53:43,540 --> 06:53:46,540
Uh, please, she sounded indifferent.

5129
06:54:02,540 --> 06:54:08,540
What's this about becoming an agent and a nocturnal?

5130
06:54:13,540 --> 06:54:14,540
What?

5131
06:54:17,540 --> 06:54:18,540
Present moon?

5132
06:54:18,540 --> 06:54:20,540
I think is what we want.

5133
06:54:20,540 --> 06:54:23,540
A full moon for the agent of strife.

5134
06:54:24,540 --> 06:54:27,540
This is nocturnal's role in maintaining balance.

5135
06:54:28,540 --> 06:54:32,540
How is this goddess of stealth when it's clear?

5136
06:54:32,540 --> 06:54:33,540
Ha!

5137
06:54:33,540 --> 06:54:38,540
The clap of her cheeks would alarm the guards on a 500 meter radius.

5138
06:54:40,540 --> 06:54:41,540
It's unfamiliar.

5139
06:54:41,540 --> 06:54:43,540
Her hotness is so powerful.

5140
06:54:48,540 --> 06:54:49,540
And you?

5141
06:54:51,540 --> 06:54:52,540
Aw.

5142
06:54:55,540 --> 06:54:56,540
The beginning of what?

5143
06:55:04,540 --> 06:55:05,540
Wow.

5144
06:55:10,540 --> 06:55:12,540
They're not good at what we do.

5145
06:55:14,540 --> 06:55:15,540
Uh, I think stealth.

5146
06:55:15,540 --> 06:55:17,540
Tell me about the present, then.

5147
06:55:20,540 --> 06:55:21,540
Yeah, okay.

5148
06:55:21,540 --> 06:55:23,540
Well, you do the agent of...

5149
06:55:24,540 --> 06:55:26,540
Are you a crescent moon?

5150
06:55:26,540 --> 06:55:28,540
You're a full moon.

5151
06:55:28,540 --> 06:55:29,540
And you're a half moon.

5152
06:55:29,540 --> 06:55:30,540
Okay, crescent moon.

5153
06:55:32,540 --> 06:55:33,540
Hee-hee.

5154
06:55:33,540 --> 06:55:34,540
Okay, now what?

5155
06:55:35,540 --> 06:55:36,540
Oh, no.

5156
06:55:36,540 --> 06:55:37,540
Gallus is about to come...

5157
06:55:40,540 --> 06:55:43,540
Ooh, look, it's Gallus and Karnaya.

5158
06:55:43,540 --> 06:55:45,540
They're gonna kiss.

5159
06:55:50,540 --> 06:55:51,540
Come like the others.

5160
06:55:52,540 --> 06:55:55,540
If it were not for the actions of this knight in the air,

5161
06:55:55,540 --> 06:55:58,540
what the years would have come through.

5162
06:55:58,540 --> 06:56:01,540
She would have just lost all of it.

5163
06:56:01,540 --> 06:56:03,540
You do now, my love.

5164
06:56:04,540 --> 06:56:07,540
Nocturnal calls me to the Everglow.

5165
06:56:07,540 --> 06:56:10,540
My contract has been fulfilled.

5166
06:56:11,540 --> 06:56:13,540
When I ever see you again.

5167
06:56:13,540 --> 06:56:16,540
When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid,

5168
06:56:16,540 --> 06:56:18,540
we'll embrace what's there.

5169
06:56:18,540 --> 06:56:19,540
Aww.

5170
06:56:25,540 --> 06:56:27,540
I've been 25 years since you've seen each other,

5171
06:56:27,540 --> 06:56:28,540
and this is it.

5172
06:56:28,540 --> 06:56:30,540
This is what they muster.

5173
06:56:31,540 --> 06:56:32,540
Are you alright, Karnaya?

5174
06:56:32,540 --> 06:56:33,540
Maybe it's just not...

5175
06:56:33,540 --> 06:56:35,540
It shouldn't understand.

5176
06:56:36,540 --> 06:56:38,540
Oh, he's going to disappear into the bowl of soup.

5177
06:56:38,540 --> 06:56:40,540
Oh, he's in the bowl of soup, lads.

5178
06:56:40,540 --> 06:56:43,540
Sorry, I'm sure it's really emotional.

5179
06:56:44,540 --> 06:56:47,540
Where did Gallus go in a bowl of soup?

5180
06:56:49,540 --> 06:56:52,540
The spirit becomes one with the Everglow.

5181
06:56:55,540 --> 06:56:56,540
Ah.

5182
06:56:56,540 --> 06:56:58,540
So he's gone?

5183
06:57:02,540 --> 06:57:03,540
Okay.

5184
06:57:05,540 --> 06:57:08,540
You drank the ghost soup, honestly.

5185
06:57:11,540 --> 06:57:14,540
They're a part of the darkness around us?

5186
06:57:19,540 --> 06:57:22,540
Oh, they're so cool.

5187
06:57:34,540 --> 06:57:37,540
Oh, I'm getting it now.

5188
06:57:37,540 --> 06:57:39,540
How will I know if I'm needed here?

5189
06:57:42,540 --> 06:57:43,540
Okay.

5190
06:57:48,540 --> 06:57:50,540
Use it whenever you wish.

5191
06:57:51,540 --> 06:57:52,540
Okay.

5192
06:57:54,540 --> 06:57:55,540
Where will you be?

5193
06:57:55,540 --> 06:57:58,540
I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall.

5194
06:57:58,540 --> 06:58:00,540
Since it's your home as well,

5195
06:58:00,540 --> 06:58:02,540
I hope to see you and Brynjolf there.

5196
06:58:03,540 --> 06:58:06,540
Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities too.

5197
06:58:06,540 --> 06:58:09,540
The quiet thing is from time to time.

5198
06:58:09,540 --> 06:58:11,540
Can't afford to get rusty now, can we?

5199
06:58:12,540 --> 06:58:13,540
Well, I'm...

5200
06:58:13,540 --> 06:58:15,540
I'm satisfied.

5201
06:58:16,540 --> 06:58:18,540
Yeah, yeah, bye-bye. Okay, thank you.

5202
06:58:19,540 --> 06:58:20,540
Thank you, hubby-bee.

5203
06:58:20,540 --> 06:58:22,540
Is this your home now?

5204
06:58:22,540 --> 06:58:23,540
It is!

5205
06:58:23,540 --> 06:58:25,540
Okay, so she just hangs out here now.

5206
06:58:25,540 --> 06:58:27,540
Girl, that's a bit depressive.

5207
06:58:27,540 --> 06:58:29,540
But anyway, that's all new.

5208
06:58:29,540 --> 06:58:31,540
As long as you're having a good time and all that.

5209
06:58:31,540 --> 06:58:35,540
Thanks for the experience of being in Nightingale.

5210
06:58:36,540 --> 06:58:38,540
Alright, have a good night and good luck.

5211
06:58:38,540 --> 06:58:39,540
Thank you!

5212
06:58:39,540 --> 06:58:41,540
For those of you who need to go rest, please do rest.

5213
06:58:41,540 --> 06:58:44,540
I am literally farting about, um...

5214
06:58:45,540 --> 06:58:47,540
Cause...

5215
06:58:47,540 --> 06:58:50,540
Mercy is going live in two hours.

5216
06:58:50,540 --> 06:58:52,540
I'm gonna redirect into her,

5217
06:58:52,540 --> 06:58:54,540
and then it means I can...

5218
06:58:54,540 --> 06:58:56,540
do a little bit of...

5219
06:58:56,540 --> 06:59:00,540
a little bit of preparation for my monetization stream tomorrow.

5220
06:59:00,540 --> 06:59:02,540
I'll need to actually make the thumbnail,

5221
06:59:02,540 --> 06:59:04,540
and you get a picture of my frickin' feet for the thumbnail.

5222
06:59:04,540 --> 06:59:05,540
Omega at low.

5223
06:59:07,540 --> 06:59:09,540
Oh no, what did I do now?

5224
06:59:10,540 --> 06:59:12,540
Well, we do...

5225
06:59:12,540 --> 06:59:13,540
Night...

5226
06:59:13,540 --> 06:59:16,540
Night mother, night mother, send your child unto me for...

5227
06:59:16,540 --> 06:59:17,540
Oh no, sweet mother.

5228
06:59:17,540 --> 06:59:19,540
I keep saying night mother.

5229
06:59:19,540 --> 06:59:21,540
Apparently...

5230
06:59:21,540 --> 06:59:23,540
it's sweet mother.

5231
06:59:23,540 --> 06:59:26,540
I could've sworn I turned that on.

5232
06:59:26,540 --> 06:59:27,540
Man, there we go.

5233
06:59:27,540 --> 06:59:29,540
Yeah.

5234
06:59:29,540 --> 06:59:32,540
Group brushing, T-minus 90 minutes, yes.

5235
06:59:32,540 --> 06:59:33,540
Um, right.

5236
06:59:33,540 --> 06:59:35,540
I am going to make a cup of tea

5237
06:59:35,540 --> 06:59:37,540
if we would all like to get something to hydrate.

5238
06:59:37,540 --> 06:59:39,540
Gotta go to Winterhold for that one.

5239
06:59:39,540 --> 06:59:40,540
Yes.

5240
06:59:40,540 --> 06:59:43,540
I'm gonna make a cup of tea,

5241
06:59:43,540 --> 06:59:45,540
and then...

5242
06:59:45,540 --> 06:59:46,540
we will...

5243
06:59:46,540 --> 06:59:49,540
see how far we can get on the Dark Brotherhood.

5244
06:59:49,540 --> 06:59:51,540
There's absolutely no way in heck

5245
06:59:51,540 --> 06:59:54,540
we are getting anywhere close to it.

5246
06:59:54,540 --> 06:59:56,540
Um...

5247
06:59:56,540 --> 06:59:57,540
But...

5248
06:59:57,540 --> 06:59:59,540
it doesn't mean we can't start it.

5249
06:59:59,540 --> 07:00:00,540
Okay, man.

5250
07:00:00,540 --> 07:00:02,540
I'll arrive late for tomorrow's stream,

5251
07:00:02,540 --> 07:00:03,540
cause I'll be at work.

5252
07:00:03,540 --> 07:00:05,540
It's a very short stream tomorrow.

5253
07:00:05,540 --> 07:00:07,540
It's not Skyrim Part 2.

5254
07:00:07,540 --> 07:00:09,540
Just, uh...

5255
07:00:09,540 --> 07:00:11,540
for those of you who may be lurking,

5256
07:00:11,540 --> 07:00:13,540
there is not a Skyrim Part 2 tomorrow,

5257
07:00:13,540 --> 07:00:15,540
cause I've completely messed up the achievements,

5258
07:00:15,540 --> 07:00:18,540
and the whole point was to do the achievements,

5259
07:00:18,540 --> 07:00:20,540
um...

5260
07:00:20,540 --> 07:00:22,540
and for some reason they're not working,

5261
07:00:22,540 --> 07:00:24,540
even though I am on Xbox Game Pass.

5262
07:00:24,540 --> 07:00:25,540
Um...

5263
07:00:25,540 --> 07:00:27,540
But we do have plenty of time in the future.

5264
07:00:27,540 --> 07:00:29,540
I will definitely come back to Skyrim

5265
07:00:29,540 --> 07:00:31,540
once I've fixed whatever's going on.

5266
07:00:31,540 --> 07:00:33,540
Cause honestly, I'm like,

5267
07:00:33,540 --> 07:00:35,540
I should have just played cameo.

5268
07:00:35,540 --> 07:00:37,540
Um...

5269
07:00:39,540 --> 07:00:41,540
Sorry, we need to break in here

5270
07:00:41,540 --> 07:00:43,540
so we can go talk to this kid.

5271
07:00:43,540 --> 07:00:45,540
Sweet mother, sweet mother,

5272
07:00:45,540 --> 07:00:47,540
send your child unto me

5273
07:00:47,540 --> 07:00:49,540
for this soon.

5274
07:00:49,540 --> 07:00:51,540
Very tired.

5275
07:00:51,540 --> 07:00:53,540
Oh no.

5276
07:00:53,540 --> 07:00:55,540
Sweet mother, sweet mother,

5277
07:00:55,540 --> 07:00:57,540
send your child unto me.

5278
07:00:57,540 --> 07:00:59,540
Send your child unto me.

5279
07:01:01,540 --> 07:01:03,540
So you come in.

5280
07:01:03,540 --> 07:01:05,540
How long must I do this?

5281
07:01:05,540 --> 07:01:07,540
I keep praying, mother,

5282
07:01:07,540 --> 07:01:09,540
for I want you to answer me.

5283
07:01:09,540 --> 07:01:11,540
S.

5284
07:01:11,540 --> 07:01:13,540
You've come at last. I knew you would.

5285
07:01:13,540 --> 07:01:15,540
Are you alright?

5286
07:01:15,540 --> 07:01:17,540
I knew you'd come. I just knew it.

5287
07:01:17,540 --> 07:01:19,540
I did the Black Sacrament

5288
07:01:19,540 --> 07:01:21,540
over and over with the body

5289
07:01:21,540 --> 07:01:23,540
and the things that came

5290
07:01:23,540 --> 07:01:25,540
in a assassin from the Dark Brotherhood.

5291
07:01:25,540 --> 07:01:27,540
Uh...

5292
07:01:29,540 --> 07:01:31,540
Ah yes, the Black Sacrament

5293
07:01:31,540 --> 07:01:33,540
of course.

5294
07:01:33,540 --> 07:01:35,540
So long. So very long.

5295
07:01:35,540 --> 07:01:37,540
But now that you're here,

5296
07:01:37,540 --> 07:01:39,540
you can accept my contract.

5297
07:01:39,540 --> 07:01:41,540
Your contract?

5298
07:01:41,540 --> 07:01:43,540
My mother, she...

5299
07:01:43,540 --> 07:01:45,540
she died.

5300
07:01:45,540 --> 07:01:47,540
I'm all alone now.

5301
07:01:47,540 --> 07:01:49,540
So they sent me to the terrible orphanage

5302
07:01:49,540 --> 07:01:51,540
in Riften on her hall.

5303
07:01:51,540 --> 07:01:53,540
The headmistress is an evil cruel woman.

5304
07:01:53,540 --> 07:01:55,540
They call her Grelad the kind.

5305
07:01:55,540 --> 07:01:57,540
But she's not kind.

5306
07:01:57,540 --> 07:01:59,540
She's terrible to all of us.

5307
07:01:59,540 --> 07:02:01,540
So I ran away

5308
07:02:01,540 --> 07:02:03,540
and came home and performed

5309
07:02:03,540 --> 07:02:05,540
the Black Sacrament.

5310
07:02:05,540 --> 07:02:07,540
Now you're here and you can kill

5311
07:02:07,540 --> 07:02:09,540
Grelad the kind.

5312
07:02:09,540 --> 07:02:11,540
Ah...

5313
07:02:11,540 --> 07:02:13,540
Sure, buddy.

5314
07:02:15,540 --> 07:02:17,540
A kiss by the sweet mother.

5315
07:02:17,540 --> 07:02:19,540
What does the book say? Hand that book over.

5316
07:02:19,540 --> 07:02:21,540
So you wish to summon the Dark Brotherhood.

5317
07:02:21,540 --> 07:02:23,540
You wish to see someone dead.

5318
07:02:23,540 --> 07:02:25,540
Pray, child, pray,

5319
07:02:25,540 --> 07:02:27,540
and let the Night Mother hear your plea.

5320
07:02:27,540 --> 07:02:29,540
You must perform

5321
07:02:29,540 --> 07:02:31,540
that most profane of rituals,

5322
07:02:31,540 --> 07:02:33,540
the Black Sacrament.

5323
07:02:33,540 --> 07:02:35,540
Create an effigy

5324
07:02:35,540 --> 07:02:37,540
of the intended victim

5325
07:02:37,540 --> 07:02:39,540
assembled from actual body parts

5326
07:02:39,540 --> 07:02:41,540
including a heart, skull,

5327
07:02:41,540 --> 07:02:43,540
bones and flesh.

5328
07:02:43,540 --> 07:02:45,540
Encircle that effigy with candles.

5329
07:02:45,540 --> 07:02:47,540
The ritual itself must then commence.

5330
07:02:47,540 --> 07:02:49,540
Proceed to stab the effigy

5331
07:02:49,540 --> 07:02:51,540
repeatedly with a dagger.

5332
07:02:51,540 --> 07:02:53,540
Rubbed with the petals

5333
07:02:53,540 --> 07:02:55,540
of a nightshade plant

5334
07:02:55,540 --> 07:02:57,540
while whispering this plea.

5335
07:02:57,540 --> 07:02:59,540
Sweet mother, sweet mother,

5336
07:02:59,540 --> 07:03:01,540
send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy

5337
07:03:01,540 --> 07:03:03,540
must be baptized in blood and fear.

5338
07:03:03,540 --> 07:03:05,540
Then wait, child,

5339
07:03:05,540 --> 07:03:07,540
for the dread father

5340
07:03:07,540 --> 07:03:09,540
sithis rewards the patient.

5341
07:03:09,540 --> 07:03:11,540
You will be visited

5342
07:03:11,540 --> 07:03:13,540
by a representative of the Dark Brotherhood.

5343
07:03:13,540 --> 07:03:15,540
So begins

5344
07:03:15,540 --> 07:03:17,540
a contract bound in blood.

5345
07:03:17,540 --> 07:03:19,540
That's actually really cool.

5346
07:03:19,540 --> 07:03:21,540
Oh, I'm quite happy with that.

5347
07:03:21,540 --> 07:03:23,540
I quite like that kind of back

5348
07:03:23,540 --> 07:03:25,540
behind the scenes, not behind the scenes

5349
07:03:25,540 --> 07:03:27,540
because it's like hidden in a book so it's not behind the scenes.

5350
07:03:27,540 --> 07:03:29,540
But I like

5351
07:03:29,540 --> 07:03:31,540
seeing how the game like tried to

5352
07:03:31,540 --> 07:03:33,540
explain it.

5353
07:03:33,540 --> 07:03:35,540
It's a great thing. Where did he find

5354
07:03:35,540 --> 07:03:37,540
the body part? Oh, he tried his best, okay.

5355
07:03:37,540 --> 07:03:39,540
Probably went into the crypt

5356
07:03:39,540 --> 07:03:41,540
or something like that.

5357
07:03:41,540 --> 07:03:43,540
So this is probably the only

5358
07:03:43,540 --> 07:03:45,540
instance when you can

5359
07:03:45,540 --> 07:03:47,540
perish someone in front of a whole group

5360
07:03:47,540 --> 07:03:49,540
of people.

5361
07:03:49,540 --> 07:03:51,540
Sorry, hen.

5362
07:03:55,540 --> 07:03:57,540
Yeah, you do not get in trouble for doing

5363
07:03:57,540 --> 07:03:59,540
that. And all the kids

5364
07:04:01,540 --> 07:04:03,540
and they're like laughing

5365
07:04:03,540 --> 07:04:05,540
at our own stuff.

5366
07:04:05,540 --> 07:04:07,540
Wait, oh, I've gone the wrong way.

5367
07:04:07,540 --> 07:04:09,540
Sorry, I've gone the wrong way.

5368
07:04:09,540 --> 07:04:11,540
We're saved.

5369
07:04:13,540 --> 07:04:15,540
Yeah, literally

5370
07:04:15,540 --> 07:04:17,540
one of the only instances you can

5371
07:04:17,540 --> 07:04:19,540
walk in and perish someone and then come

5372
07:04:19,540 --> 07:04:21,540
straight back out again.

5373
07:04:21,540 --> 07:04:23,540
They don't care. No one cares.

5374
07:04:23,540 --> 07:04:25,540
The Riften Guards don't even care.

5375
07:04:25,540 --> 07:04:27,540
They must have known as well.

5376
07:04:27,540 --> 07:04:29,540
The actual nice lady takes over.

5377
07:04:29,540 --> 07:04:31,540
Yeah.

5378
07:04:31,540 --> 07:04:33,540
So really, we just did everyone a big old favor.

5379
07:04:33,540 --> 07:04:35,540
Okay.

5380
07:04:35,540 --> 07:04:37,540
I was like finding

5381
07:04:37,540 --> 07:04:39,540
different fun ways. Apparently you can cast

5382
07:04:39,540 --> 07:04:41,540
Friendsly in the Children

5383
07:04:41,540 --> 07:04:43,540
Parish Grail Oak. I'm not sure if that's true

5384
07:04:43,540 --> 07:04:45,540
or not.

5385
07:04:45,540 --> 07:04:47,540
Is she, you know,

5386
07:04:47,540 --> 07:04:49,540
kind of sounds like

5387
07:04:49,540 --> 07:04:51,540
Midoriya.

5388
07:04:51,540 --> 07:04:53,540
I knew you could do it.

5389
07:04:53,540 --> 07:04:55,540
I just knew it. I knew the Dark Brotherhood

5390
07:04:55,540 --> 07:04:57,540
would save me. Here, just like

5391
07:04:57,540 --> 07:04:59,540
I promised. This should bet you a nice

5392
07:04:59,540 --> 07:05:01,540
price. Thank you.

5393
07:05:01,540 --> 07:05:03,540
Thank you again.

5394
07:05:03,540 --> 07:05:05,540
What did you give me? Your child.

5395
07:05:05,540 --> 07:05:07,540
Completed Innocence Loss.

5396
07:05:09,540 --> 07:05:11,540
Family heirloom?

5397
07:05:11,540 --> 07:05:13,540
Oh, sorry, sorry.

5398
07:05:13,540 --> 07:05:15,540
My bad. I got a little...

5399
07:05:15,540 --> 07:05:17,540
I just needed to check what your family

5400
07:05:17,540 --> 07:05:19,540
heirloom was.

5401
07:05:19,540 --> 07:05:21,540
Is it any?

5402
07:05:21,540 --> 07:05:23,540
Oh, there is.

5403
07:05:23,540 --> 07:05:25,540
A plate? A plate.

5404
07:05:25,540 --> 07:05:27,540
I mean, you are a child, so I guess that makes

5405
07:05:27,540 --> 07:05:29,540
sense.

5406
07:05:29,540 --> 07:05:31,540
Now, if I remember correctly,

5407
07:05:31,540 --> 07:05:33,540
we need to go sleep in a bed.

5408
07:05:33,540 --> 07:05:35,540
Yeah, the first sleep

5409
07:05:35,540 --> 07:05:37,540
the poor Dragonborn has had since I started

5410
07:05:37,540 --> 07:05:39,540
my adventures.

5411
07:05:39,540 --> 07:05:41,540
So, we'll just rent a little bed in here.

5412
07:05:43,540 --> 07:05:45,540
You ever just accidentally dash across the house, honestly?

5413
07:05:47,540 --> 07:05:49,540
Oh, you. Hello.

5414
07:05:51,540 --> 07:05:53,540
Can you come a bit closer?

5415
07:05:53,540 --> 07:05:55,540
Okay, I guess not.

5416
07:05:55,540 --> 07:05:57,540
Yeah, I'd like to rent a room.

5417
07:05:57,540 --> 07:05:59,540
Thanks, darling.

5418
07:05:59,540 --> 07:06:01,540
Oh, okay.

5419
07:06:01,540 --> 07:06:03,540
Ten, ten stars.

5420
07:06:05,540 --> 07:06:07,540
Hello, my lady.

5421
07:06:07,540 --> 07:06:09,540
You want to join me?

5422
07:06:15,540 --> 07:06:17,540
Okay.

5423
07:06:19,540 --> 07:06:21,540
Right, please stop talking to me. I'm trying to be

5424
07:06:21,540 --> 07:06:23,540
sure in my room, but I'm having to help the NPC.

5425
07:06:23,540 --> 07:06:25,540
Okay, there we go. Thank you for showing me my room.

5426
07:06:27,540 --> 07:06:29,540
If you want the tip, just stay in the room.

5427
07:06:29,540 --> 07:06:31,540
We're getting that bed.

5428
07:06:31,540 --> 07:06:33,540
That's absolutely shocking behaviour.

5429
07:06:33,540 --> 07:06:35,540
Please stop.

5430
07:06:35,540 --> 07:06:37,540
Twelvers, we won't make a cup of tea very

5431
07:06:37,540 --> 07:06:39,540
shortly. I'm sorry.

5432
07:06:39,540 --> 07:06:41,540
I'm getting delirious.

5433
07:06:41,540 --> 07:06:43,540
Miss Droney, can I be excused from history

5434
07:06:43,540 --> 07:06:45,540
of the Nordic class to use the bathroom?

5435
07:06:45,540 --> 07:06:47,540
Yes, you're allowed to use the toilet.

5436
07:06:47,540 --> 07:06:49,540
Right, I am going

5437
07:06:49,540 --> 07:06:51,540
to go make a cup of tea.

5438
07:06:55,540 --> 07:06:57,540
What? Was that not supposed to be kidnapped?

5439
07:06:59,540 --> 07:07:01,540
Was that not supposed to be kidnapped?

5440
07:07:01,540 --> 07:07:03,540
After you perish?

5441
07:07:07,540 --> 07:07:09,540
Does it have to be about the island?

5442
07:07:15,540 --> 07:07:17,540
Huh.

5443
07:07:19,540 --> 07:07:21,540
Give her to her, kid.

5444
07:07:21,540 --> 07:07:23,540
It's after you receive a courier's lair.

5445
07:07:23,540 --> 07:07:25,540
Ah!

5446
07:07:25,540 --> 07:07:27,540
How are you streaming now? How are you so powerful?

5447
07:07:27,540 --> 07:07:29,540
That's...

5448
07:07:29,540 --> 07:07:31,540
It's called Othezam.

5449
07:07:31,540 --> 07:07:33,540
And I love my games.

5450
07:07:33,540 --> 07:07:35,540
Right, I'm waiting on the courier.

5451
07:07:35,540 --> 07:07:37,540
Courier, courier.

5452
07:07:37,540 --> 07:07:39,540
Courier, courier. Give me a letter.

5453
07:07:39,540 --> 07:07:41,540
Courier, my boss.

5454
07:07:41,540 --> 07:07:43,540
Right, ah, sorry.

5455
07:07:43,540 --> 07:07:45,540
I'm going to go get a cup of tea to recalibrate

5456
07:07:45,540 --> 07:07:47,540
because I have been playing for a hot second.

5457
07:07:47,540 --> 07:07:49,540
I'm going to have to pause the game

5458
07:07:49,540 --> 07:07:51,540
sadly because there can be NPC

5459
07:07:51,540 --> 07:07:53,540
events such as Coltas entering

5460
07:07:53,540 --> 07:07:55,540
the town which can kill NPCs.

5461
07:07:55,540 --> 07:07:57,540
So I will have it paused

5462
07:07:57,540 --> 07:07:59,540
whilst I go quickly make a cup of tea.

5463
07:07:59,540 --> 07:08:01,540
Please do

5464
07:08:01,540 --> 07:08:03,540
stretch your legs

5465
07:08:03,540 --> 07:08:05,540
and get yourself a wee water

5466
07:08:05,540 --> 07:08:07,540
and have a pee.

5467
07:08:09,540 --> 07:08:11,540
You got to sleep.

5468
07:08:11,540 --> 07:08:13,540
No.

5469
07:08:13,540 --> 07:08:15,540
Alright, sorry man.

5470
07:08:15,540 --> 07:08:17,540
I thought you had to sleep right away

5471
07:08:17,540 --> 07:08:19,540
but I need to receive the letter

5472
07:08:19,540 --> 07:08:21,540
with a hand that says we know and then go to sleep.

5473
07:08:21,540 --> 07:08:23,540
Okay?

5474
07:08:23,540 --> 07:08:25,540
I'm going to go get some water.

5475
07:08:25,540 --> 07:08:27,540
I'm going to get a cup of tea

5476
07:08:27,540 --> 07:08:29,540
and we're going to recalibrate and come back

5477
07:08:29,540 --> 07:08:31,540
and meet in the middle.

5478
07:08:31,540 --> 07:08:33,540
It will be a couple of minutes, okay?

5479
07:08:33,540 --> 07:08:35,540
I think I can get a wee snack

5480
07:08:35,540 --> 07:08:37,540
as well.

5481
07:08:37,540 --> 07:08:39,540
Right, beer, beer.

5482
07:08:53,540 --> 07:08:55,540
Thank you.

5483
07:09:23,540 --> 07:09:25,540
Thank you.

5484
07:09:53,540 --> 07:09:55,540
Thank you.

5485
07:10:23,540 --> 07:10:25,540
Thank you.

5486
07:10:53,540 --> 07:10:55,540
Thank you.

5487
07:11:23,540 --> 07:11:25,540
Thank you.

5488
07:11:53,540 --> 07:11:55,540
Thank you.

5489
07:12:23,540 --> 07:12:25,540
Thank you.

5490
07:12:53,540 --> 07:12:55,540
Thank you.

5491
07:13:23,540 --> 07:13:25,540
Thank you.

5492
07:13:53,540 --> 07:13:55,540
Thank you.

5493
07:14:23,540 --> 07:14:25,540
Thank you.

5494
07:14:53,540 --> 07:14:55,540
Welcome to Europe.

5495
07:14:55,540 --> 07:14:57,540
Wait, I said that wrong.

5496
07:14:57,540 --> 07:14:59,540
Welcome to Europe, young man.

5497
07:14:59,540 --> 07:15:01,540
Welcome to Europe.

5498
07:15:01,540 --> 07:15:03,540
Welcome to Europe.

5499
07:15:03,540 --> 07:15:05,540
Remember the 10 Eurovision?

5500
07:15:05,540 --> 07:15:07,540
Remember the 10 Eurovision?

5501
07:15:07,540 --> 07:15:09,540
Sorry.

5502
07:15:09,540 --> 07:15:11,540
I'm sorry.

5503
07:15:11,540 --> 07:15:13,540
I'm sorry.

5504
07:15:13,540 --> 07:15:15,540
I'm sorry.

5505
07:15:15,540 --> 07:15:17,540
I'm sorry.

5506
07:15:17,540 --> 07:15:19,540
I'm sorry.

5507
07:15:19,540 --> 07:15:21,540
I'm sorry.

5508
07:15:21,540 --> 07:15:23,540
Sorry, that was the worst Dutch

5509
07:15:23,540 --> 07:15:25,540
I think I've ever done so far.

5510
07:15:25,540 --> 07:15:27,540
I do apologize to any

5511
07:15:27,540 --> 07:15:29,540
Nederland mensen

5512
07:15:29,540 --> 07:15:31,540
who are listening in.

5513
07:15:31,540 --> 07:15:33,540
Everyone else is just like,

5514
07:15:33,540 --> 07:15:35,540
what on earth are you even on about?

5515
07:15:35,540 --> 07:15:37,540
Hi.

5516
07:15:37,540 --> 07:15:39,540
Welcome back.

5517
07:15:39,540 --> 07:15:41,540
What, you thought I was gone forever?

5518
07:15:41,540 --> 07:15:43,540
I've got me a cup of tea

5519
07:15:43,540 --> 07:15:45,540
and I've actually got stroepwafel.

5520
07:15:45,540 --> 07:15:47,540
I'm not even kidding.

5521
07:15:47,540 --> 07:15:49,540
I have actual stroepwafel.

5522
07:15:49,540 --> 07:15:51,540
On the rating stream

5523
07:15:51,540 --> 07:15:53,540
but I couldn't find any more

5524
07:15:53,540 --> 07:15:55,540
European snacks.

5525
07:15:55,540 --> 07:15:57,540
So I'm just literally going to

5526
07:15:57,540 --> 07:15:59,540
eat a little stroepwafel.

5527
07:16:01,540 --> 07:16:03,540
Welcome back.

5528
07:16:03,540 --> 07:16:05,540
I love stroepwafel.

5529
07:16:05,540 --> 07:16:07,540
It's like crack cocaine.

5530
07:16:07,540 --> 07:16:09,540
Sorry, but it's so good.

5531
07:16:11,540 --> 07:16:13,540
Yes, merci for the snippets

5532
07:16:13,540 --> 07:16:15,540
who are lurking.

5533
07:16:15,540 --> 07:16:17,540
I appreciate you even if I'm not your

5534
07:16:17,540 --> 07:16:19,540
flavor.

5535
07:16:19,540 --> 07:16:21,540
T minus one hour

5536
07:16:21,540 --> 07:16:23,540
and 40 minutes

5537
07:16:23,540 --> 07:16:25,540
until your

5538
07:16:25,540 --> 07:16:27,540
Kohai

5539
07:16:27,540 --> 07:16:29,540
is ready to say hi hi

5540
07:16:29,540 --> 07:16:31,540
and prove that

5541
07:16:31,540 --> 07:16:33,540
she can't whistle.

5542
07:16:33,540 --> 07:16:35,540
Which is adorable.

5543
07:16:35,540 --> 07:16:37,540
I can't believe that I hired her on the basis she can't

5544
07:16:37,540 --> 07:16:39,540
whistle. Stop leaving

5545
07:16:39,540 --> 07:16:41,540
I'm not allowed to go get a cup

5546
07:16:41,540 --> 07:16:43,540
of tea for my

5547
07:16:43,540 --> 07:16:45,540
boys.

5548
07:16:45,540 --> 07:16:47,540
Are you like hearing my words?

5549
07:16:47,540 --> 07:16:49,540
Are you ending

5550
07:16:49,540 --> 07:16:51,540
when merci comes on?

5551
07:16:51,540 --> 07:16:53,540
Yes, I'm going to redirect into her on purpose

5552
07:16:53,540 --> 07:16:55,540
because

5553
07:16:55,540 --> 07:16:57,540
I didn't know I was getting monetization

5554
07:16:57,540 --> 07:16:59,540
today.

5555
07:16:59,540 --> 07:17:01,540
So tomorrow we're doing the monetization

5556
07:17:01,540 --> 07:17:03,540
celebration.

5557
07:17:03,540 --> 07:17:05,540
So I need to set up

5558
07:17:05,540 --> 07:17:07,540
all the emotes and I need to set up on the

5559
07:17:07,540 --> 07:17:09,540
price.

5560
07:17:09,540 --> 07:17:11,540
And I think very sadly I have to

5561
07:17:11,540 --> 07:17:13,540
charge more than 4.99

5562
07:17:13,540 --> 07:17:15,540
US dollars.

5563
07:17:15,540 --> 07:17:17,540
But I think I might have to

5564
07:17:17,540 --> 07:17:19,540
because of this YouTube gifting

5565
07:17:19,540 --> 07:17:21,540
stuff.

5566
07:17:21,540 --> 07:17:23,540
Can any of yous confirm that

5567
07:17:23,540 --> 07:17:25,540
YouTube gifting thing is a nightmare

5568
07:17:25,540 --> 07:17:27,540
or a hassle?

5569
07:17:27,540 --> 07:17:29,540
I'm going to take a bite of my waffle

5570
07:17:29,540 --> 07:17:31,540
okay?

5571
07:17:31,540 --> 07:17:33,540
Mmm.

5572
07:17:41,540 --> 07:17:43,540
I know it's only like 2 cents

5573
07:17:43,540 --> 07:17:45,540
difference. I just don't like that.

5574
07:17:45,540 --> 07:17:47,540
Hold on.

5575
07:17:47,540 --> 07:17:49,540
I'm going to

5576
07:17:49,540 --> 07:17:51,540
check out

5577
07:17:51,540 --> 07:17:53,540
Marshmallows

5578
07:17:53,540 --> 07:17:55,540
if you'd like to send me any marshmallows

5579
07:17:55,540 --> 07:17:57,540
I'm just going to take a quick pause champ

5580
07:17:57,540 --> 07:17:59,540
on top of everything.

5581
07:17:59,540 --> 07:18:01,540
Jesus Christ

5582
07:18:01,540 --> 07:18:03,540
why do I have so many DMs?

5583
07:18:05,540 --> 07:18:07,540
Okay

5584
07:18:07,540 --> 07:18:09,540
I don't know

5585
07:18:09,540 --> 07:18:11,540
for the most part.

5586
07:18:11,540 --> 07:18:13,540
Oh and now I can't see my mouse again.

5587
07:18:15,540 --> 07:18:17,540
Okay marshmallow refresh

5588
07:18:17,540 --> 07:18:19,540
let's go.

5589
07:18:21,540 --> 07:18:23,540
A lot of follow girls

5590
07:18:23,540 --> 07:18:25,540
have 1.99 tier and then 4.99

5591
07:18:25,540 --> 07:18:27,540
and the gift goes to the 4.99

5592
07:18:27,540 --> 07:18:29,540
Ah

5593
07:18:31,540 --> 07:18:33,540
I'm at exactly $5 work

5594
07:18:33,540 --> 07:18:35,540
I possibly

5595
07:18:45,540 --> 07:18:47,540
Hello mommy

5596
07:18:47,540 --> 07:18:49,540
you're asking what software baby uses

5597
07:18:49,540 --> 07:18:51,540
for 3D is called

5598
07:18:51,540 --> 07:18:53,540
Warudo

5599
07:18:53,540 --> 07:18:55,540
for full body tracking there's a lot of videos

5600
07:18:55,540 --> 07:18:57,540
about it but I think most YouTubers use

5601
07:18:57,540 --> 07:18:59,540
Sony mo copy

5602
07:18:59,540 --> 07:19:01,540
Slime VR

5603
07:19:01,540 --> 07:19:03,540
or Vine trackers

5604
07:19:03,540 --> 07:19:05,540
okay okay

5605
07:19:05,540 --> 07:19:07,540
It's okay mommy

5606
07:19:07,540 --> 07:19:09,540
I know you can't open my last Mario link

5607
07:19:09,540 --> 07:19:11,540
on stream don't

5608
07:19:11,540 --> 07:19:13,540
forget to check later

5609
07:19:13,540 --> 07:19:15,540
Is it bad that I check?

5610
07:19:15,540 --> 07:19:17,540
As soon as I go offline

5611
07:19:17,540 --> 07:19:19,540
I just spend like another 30 minutes

5612
07:19:19,540 --> 07:19:21,540
and I'm like yeah

5613
07:19:25,540 --> 07:19:27,540
what's the problem with gifting

5614
07:19:27,540 --> 07:19:29,540
so the issue is

5615
07:19:29,540 --> 07:19:31,540
if someone is very kind to gift

5616
07:19:31,540 --> 07:19:33,540
but they can't dictate

5617
07:19:33,540 --> 07:19:35,540
what type of tier to give

5618
07:19:35,540 --> 07:19:37,540
it means

5619
07:19:37,540 --> 07:19:39,540
outsiders isn't a nice term to use

5620
07:19:39,540 --> 07:19:41,540
that's not the correct term

5621
07:19:41,540 --> 07:19:43,540
but someone who

5622
07:19:43,540 --> 07:19:45,540
maybe

5623
07:19:47,540 --> 07:19:49,540
what's the word?

5624
07:19:49,540 --> 07:19:51,540
I'm trying to think

5625
07:19:51,540 --> 07:19:53,540
someone who

5626
07:19:55,540 --> 07:19:57,540
gets access to membership streams that

5627
07:19:57,540 --> 07:19:59,540
like should name

5628
07:19:59,540 --> 07:20:01,540
you know like

5629
07:20:01,540 --> 07:20:03,540
someone who's just gonna be

5630
07:20:03,540 --> 07:20:05,540
rude about it or whatever

5631
07:20:05,540 --> 07:20:07,540
I don't know

5632
07:20:09,540 --> 07:20:11,540
yeah use whatever

5633
07:20:11,540 --> 07:20:13,540
it's better to have people

5634
07:20:13,540 --> 07:20:15,540
watching the membership streams that are

5635
07:20:15,540 --> 07:20:17,540
actually interested

5636
07:20:17,540 --> 07:20:19,540
because someone might get a

5637
07:20:19,540 --> 07:20:21,540
message and it's like

5638
07:20:21,540 --> 07:20:23,540
oh right okay

5639
07:20:25,540 --> 07:20:27,540
that's chicken

5640
07:20:29,540 --> 07:20:31,540
you might be able to turn on gifting

5641
07:20:31,540 --> 07:20:33,540
entirely well the problem is gifting

5642
07:20:33,540 --> 07:20:35,540
is a massive money source for the girls

5643
07:20:39,540 --> 07:20:41,540
if someone's gonna be

5644
07:20:41,540 --> 07:20:43,540
a shitter and members content

5645
07:20:43,540 --> 07:20:45,540
they better be paying out their own pocket

5646
07:20:45,540 --> 07:20:47,540
that's so funny I'm sorry

5647
07:20:47,540 --> 07:20:49,540
but that's actually such a funny statement

5648
07:20:51,540 --> 07:20:53,540
okay scrawny and fellow reeflings

5649
07:20:53,540 --> 07:20:55,540
I'm gonna have

5650
07:20:55,540 --> 07:20:57,540
a fun rest of the stream

5651
07:20:57,540 --> 07:20:59,540
oh now I need to go sorry

5652
07:20:59,540 --> 07:21:01,540
words are blending together

5653
07:21:01,540 --> 07:21:03,540
I'll see you tomorrow yes

5654
07:21:03,540 --> 07:21:05,540
I think it'll be roughly

5655
07:21:05,540 --> 07:21:07,540
2 hours

5656
07:21:07,540 --> 07:21:09,540
it's a short stream tomorrow do apologize

5657
07:21:09,540 --> 07:21:11,540
but I'm needing overall vocal rest

5658
07:21:11,540 --> 07:21:13,540
I've got quite a few vtuber ASMR collabs

5659
07:21:13,540 --> 07:21:15,540
coming up so

5660
07:21:15,540 --> 07:21:17,540
I'm needing to be a good girl and rest

5661
07:21:17,540 --> 07:21:19,540
and try my best

5662
07:21:19,540 --> 07:21:21,540
I am a Spanish reefling

5663
07:21:21,540 --> 07:21:23,540
and I've been very

5664
07:21:23,540 --> 07:21:25,540
no you've not

5665
07:21:27,540 --> 07:21:29,540
hold on

5666
07:21:29,540 --> 07:21:31,540
you've helped me pass some hard time

5667
07:21:31,540 --> 07:21:33,540
so I just want to know that

5668
07:21:33,540 --> 07:21:35,540
if you're really proud of you and the way your streams go

5669
07:21:35,540 --> 07:21:37,540
also

5670
07:21:37,540 --> 07:21:39,540
I like how you act

5671
07:21:39,540 --> 07:21:41,540
on stream

5672
07:21:41,540 --> 07:21:43,540
about gapping and ranking burps is fun

5673
07:21:45,540 --> 07:21:47,540
what is

5674
07:21:47,540 --> 07:21:49,540
what do you want in Spanish

5675
07:21:49,540 --> 07:21:51,540
in English

5676
07:21:51,540 --> 07:21:53,540
for me

5677
07:21:53,540 --> 07:21:55,540
because I don't know what

5678
07:21:55,540 --> 07:21:57,540
what do you want

5679
07:21:57,540 --> 07:21:59,540
I think it means

5680
07:21:59,540 --> 07:22:01,540
I don't even know

5681
07:22:05,540 --> 07:22:07,540
you are truly an anomaly

5682
07:22:07,540 --> 07:22:09,540
I've never seen someone who is

5683
07:22:09,540 --> 07:22:11,540
so intensely thoughtful

5684
07:22:11,540 --> 07:22:13,540
and caring about both

5685
07:22:13,540 --> 07:22:15,540
your daughters and reeflings

5686
07:22:15,540 --> 07:22:17,540
also shameless

5687
07:22:17,540 --> 07:22:19,540
hold on

5688
07:22:19,540 --> 07:22:21,540
what am I getting spanked by

5689
07:22:21,540 --> 07:22:23,540
it's a level of

5690
07:22:23,540 --> 07:22:25,540
authenticity

5691
07:22:25,540 --> 07:22:27,540
I would never

5692
07:22:27,540 --> 07:22:29,540
even see in a person let alone a vtuber

5693
07:22:29,540 --> 07:22:31,540
I wish you all the success in the world

5694
07:22:31,540 --> 07:22:33,540
wow

5695
07:22:33,540 --> 07:22:35,540
you did an absolutely fantastic job

5696
07:22:35,540 --> 07:22:37,540
on the tryharding in the ASMR stream

5697
07:22:37,540 --> 07:22:39,540
I can only assume you have a really good coach

5698
07:22:39,540 --> 07:22:41,540
since it took me over a year to study to get to that level

5699
07:22:41,540 --> 07:22:43,540
a coach

5700
07:22:43,540 --> 07:22:45,540
like a hypno coach

5701
07:22:45,540 --> 07:22:47,540
no

5702
07:22:47,540 --> 07:22:49,540
that's just called autism

5703
07:22:49,540 --> 07:22:51,540
and general interest

5704
07:22:51,540 --> 07:22:53,540
I just apply what I like to whatever

5705
07:22:53,540 --> 07:22:55,540
and I do it my

5706
07:22:55,540 --> 07:22:57,540
also it's something I would never do otherwise

5707
07:22:57,540 --> 07:22:59,540
but my

5708
07:22:59,540 --> 07:23:01,540
but my girlfriend

5709
07:23:01,540 --> 07:23:03,540
has convinced me I should

5710
07:23:03,540 --> 07:23:05,540
do bibbutes

5711
07:23:05,540 --> 07:23:07,540
so I printed out 21 pages

5712
07:23:07,540 --> 07:23:09,540
so I can build some

5713
07:23:09,540 --> 07:23:11,540
additional cognitive habits

5714
07:23:11,540 --> 07:23:13,540
at the end of the month

5715
07:23:13,540 --> 07:23:15,540
what is this

5716
07:23:23,540 --> 07:23:25,540
what is this

5717
07:23:25,540 --> 07:23:27,540
what is this

5718
07:23:27,540 --> 07:23:29,540
what is this

5719
07:23:29,540 --> 07:23:31,540
additional cognitive habits

5720
07:23:31,540 --> 07:23:33,540
what is this

5721
07:23:35,540 --> 07:23:37,540
21 bibbutes for me

5722
07:23:37,540 --> 07:23:39,540
for me

5723
07:23:39,540 --> 07:23:41,540
right now

5724
07:23:41,540 --> 07:23:43,540
it's almost 5am

5725
07:23:43,540 --> 07:23:45,540
yes please rest well

5726
07:23:45,540 --> 07:23:47,540
for those of you who are hanging on by a thread

5727
07:23:47,540 --> 07:23:49,540
we're

5728
07:23:49,540 --> 07:23:51,540
just going to start off the dark brotherhood

5729
07:23:51,540 --> 07:23:53,540
at this point

5730
07:23:53,540 --> 07:23:55,540
I'm going to see if I can fix achievements

5731
07:23:55,540 --> 07:23:57,540
and possibly we can come back to Skyrim

5732
07:23:57,540 --> 07:23:59,540
but tomorrow is being steamrolled

5733
07:23:59,540 --> 07:24:01,540
by monetization celebration stream

5734
07:24:01,540 --> 07:24:03,540
go get those

5735
07:24:03,540 --> 07:24:05,540
microplastics out of you somehow

5736
07:24:05,540 --> 07:24:07,540
honestly

5737
07:24:09,540 --> 07:24:11,540
hey lassie

5738
07:24:11,540 --> 07:24:13,540
would you kindly read some modellups

5739
07:24:13,540 --> 07:24:15,540
so you can see more of the girlies

5740
07:24:15,540 --> 07:24:17,540
you can zoom out a bit too if you don't want to block too much of the game

5741
07:24:19,540 --> 07:24:21,540
someone said they don't like it

5742
07:24:23,540 --> 07:24:25,540
where is it

5743
07:24:25,540 --> 07:24:27,540
I would have to go like this

5744
07:24:31,540 --> 07:24:33,540
does this work hold on

5745
07:24:33,540 --> 07:24:35,540
does that work

5746
07:24:35,540 --> 07:24:37,540
it does work

5747
07:24:39,540 --> 07:24:41,540
that's terrible

5748
07:24:43,540 --> 07:24:45,540
I can't really

5749
07:24:45,540 --> 07:24:47,540
can't really get away with it too much

5750
07:24:47,540 --> 07:24:49,540
let's behave

5751
07:24:51,540 --> 07:24:53,540
a tomato a day keeps your bars okay

5752
07:24:53,540 --> 07:24:55,540
yes that is our new slogan

5753
07:24:55,540 --> 07:24:57,540
ladies and gentlemen

5754
07:24:57,540 --> 07:24:59,540
tomato a day keeps your bar health

5755
07:24:59,540 --> 07:25:01,540
okay

5756
07:25:01,540 --> 07:25:03,540
I'm still trying to eat the same strip waffle

5757
07:25:03,540 --> 07:25:05,540
I'm getting so distracted

5758
07:25:05,540 --> 07:25:07,540
so when is the audio of you rambling about

5759
07:25:07,540 --> 07:25:09,540
Assassin's Creed or something

5760
07:25:09,540 --> 07:25:11,540
well getting your

5761
07:25:11,540 --> 07:25:13,540
what is this guy

5762
07:25:13,540 --> 07:25:15,540
oh my god you guys are getting our while

5763
07:25:15,540 --> 07:25:17,540
I'm actually doing a

5764
07:25:17,540 --> 07:25:19,540
review

5765
07:25:19,540 --> 07:25:21,540
on

5766
07:25:21,540 --> 07:25:23,540
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

5767
07:25:23,540 --> 07:25:25,540
which should come out around November

5768
07:25:25,540 --> 07:25:27,540
like I'm doing an actual game review footage

5769
07:25:27,540 --> 07:25:29,540
like I'm being so serious on it

5770
07:25:29,540 --> 07:25:31,540
so if you like hearing my accent

5771
07:25:31,540 --> 07:25:33,540
putting you to sleep well I can tell you

5772
07:25:33,540 --> 07:25:35,540
about Assassin's Creed and how amazing it is

5773
07:25:37,540 --> 07:25:39,540
sometimes I wish

5774
07:25:39,540 --> 07:25:41,540
we could see the film they're

5775
07:25:41,540 --> 07:25:43,540
they're pretty outrageous I'm trying my best

5776
07:25:43,540 --> 07:25:45,540
to like dart around them

5777
07:25:45,540 --> 07:25:47,540
but good night rest well those who need to rest

5778
07:25:47,540 --> 07:25:49,540
we love strongers the cuttlefish

5779
07:25:49,540 --> 07:25:51,540
in this house

5780
07:25:53,540 --> 07:25:55,540
strongy if you like being in games

5781
07:25:55,540 --> 07:25:57,540
kind of reckon Valhalla is such a

5782
07:25:57,540 --> 07:25:59,540
good game and I think you'll like it

5783
07:25:59,540 --> 07:26:01,540
I most certainly will check that out

5784
07:26:01,540 --> 07:26:03,540
I may have in another life thought I was

5785
07:26:03,540 --> 07:26:05,540
about to play it and then play the complete

5786
07:26:05,540 --> 07:26:07,540
wrong game which was called Helltaker I believe

5787
07:26:07,540 --> 07:26:09,540
and it was also a puzzle game and

5788
07:26:09,540 --> 07:26:11,540
I was so confused on why the game

5789
07:26:11,540 --> 07:26:13,540
looked so different to what I was playing

5790
07:26:13,540 --> 07:26:15,540
and it turns out I was playing the completely wrong

5791
07:26:15,540 --> 07:26:17,540
game but yes I would

5792
07:26:17,540 --> 07:26:19,540
love to give Valhalla a try

5793
07:26:19,540 --> 07:26:21,540
hi cuttles are Mondays and Tuesdays

5794

5795
07:26:23,540 --> 07:26:25,540
uh

5796
07:26:25,540 --> 07:26:27,540
no

5797
07:26:27,540 --> 07:26:29,540
they are not

5798
07:26:29,540 --> 07:26:31,540
it's just a

5799
07:26:31,540 --> 07:26:33,540
a quinky dink really that I put it on Monday and Tuesday

5800
07:26:33,540 --> 07:26:35,540
but no they're not always going to be the endurance on those days

5801
07:26:35,540 --> 07:26:37,540
um

5802
07:26:37,540 --> 07:26:39,540
yes

5803
07:26:45,540 --> 07:26:47,540
having you you have about to

5804
07:26:47,540 --> 07:26:49,540
squid me right now by the Pope

5805
07:26:49,540 --> 07:26:51,540
hey strongy I am back

5806
07:26:51,540 --> 07:26:53,540
I know you were wondering how to pronounce

5807
07:26:53,540 --> 07:26:55,540
my name earlier and you had

5808
07:26:55,540 --> 07:26:57,540
it right as spiny is pronounced

5809
07:26:57,540 --> 07:26:59,540
like a spiny anteater

5810
07:27:01,540 --> 07:27:03,540
I'm going to be so honest

5811
07:27:03,540 --> 07:27:05,540
Brian did not help with my confusion

5812
07:27:05,540 --> 07:27:07,540
on the pronunciation of your name

5813
07:27:07,540 --> 07:27:09,540
tiny spiny

5814
07:27:09,540 --> 07:27:11,540
what

5815
07:27:11,540 --> 07:27:13,540
and you had it right as spiny

5816
07:27:13,540 --> 07:27:15,540
is pronounced pronounced like a spiny

5817
07:27:15,540 --> 07:27:17,540
anteater a spiny

5818
07:27:17,540 --> 07:27:19,540
anteater or a

5819
07:27:19,540 --> 07:27:21,540
spiny anteater

5820
07:27:23,540 --> 07:27:25,540
Brian just made that 10

5821
07:27:25,540 --> 07:27:27,540
times worse and I do apologize if I'm

5822
07:27:27,540 --> 07:27:29,540
now officially butchering it but thank you for the tip

5823
07:27:29,540 --> 07:27:31,540
do it

5824
07:27:31,540 --> 07:27:33,540
phonetically in chat like

5825
07:27:33,540 --> 07:27:35,540
right so it's either

5826
07:27:35,540 --> 07:27:37,540
spiny

5827
07:27:37,540 --> 07:27:39,540
or did I even

5828
07:27:39,540 --> 07:27:41,540
spiny

5829
07:27:41,540 --> 07:27:43,540
so you know

5830
07:27:43,540 --> 07:27:45,540
spain

5831
07:27:45,540 --> 07:27:47,540
e okay

5832
07:27:47,540 --> 07:27:49,540
spiny

5833
07:27:49,540 --> 07:27:51,540
we got there in the end

5834
07:27:51,540 --> 07:27:53,540
literally I'm renaming everyone who

5835
07:27:53,540 --> 07:27:55,540
who just doesn't have an easy to rename

5836
07:27:55,540 --> 07:27:57,540
for me

5837
07:27:57,540 --> 07:27:59,540
spiny

5838
07:27:59,540 --> 07:28:01,540
there are

5839
07:28:01,540 --> 07:28:03,540
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday

5840
07:28:03,540 --> 07:28:05,540
endurance streams yes

5841
07:28:05,540 --> 07:28:07,540
um most of the stream sniping

5842
07:28:07,540 --> 07:28:09,540
I'm trying to do for like a big amount

5843
07:28:09,540 --> 07:28:11,540
of time because I know not everyone's available

5844
07:28:11,540 --> 07:28:13,540
right at the one

5845
07:28:13,540 --> 07:28:15,540
time zone if you will

5846
07:28:15,540 --> 07:28:17,540
uh

5847
07:28:17,540 --> 07:28:19,540
yeah

5848
07:28:21,540 --> 07:28:23,540
having you you have about developmental

5849
07:28:23,540 --> 07:28:25,540
psychology and socially

5850
07:28:25,540 --> 07:28:27,540
inculcated

5851
07:28:27,540 --> 07:28:29,540
reactions

5852
07:28:29,540 --> 07:28:31,540
to stress maybe realize I really wish that physical

5853
07:28:31,540 --> 07:28:33,540
touch and infection was more normalized in society

5854
07:28:33,540 --> 07:28:35,540
especially for men male socialized people

5855
07:28:35,540 --> 07:28:37,540
people need more hugs easy also

5856
07:28:37,540 --> 07:28:39,540
I'm curious how you deal with the stress and she mentioned

5857
07:28:39,540 --> 07:28:41,540
you don't know how we do it

5858
07:28:41,540 --> 07:28:43,540
um

5859
07:28:43,540 --> 07:28:45,540
I always

5860
07:28:45,540 --> 07:28:47,540
have a goal or something to work towards

5861
07:28:47,540 --> 07:28:49,540
which helps distract me

5862
07:28:49,540 --> 07:28:51,540
from what I'm feeling in the moment

5863
07:28:51,540 --> 07:28:53,540
and essentially makes me like numb

5864
07:28:53,540 --> 07:28:55,540
and work through it

5865
07:28:55,540 --> 07:28:57,540
so like right now my goal is to help the girls

5866
07:28:57,540 --> 07:28:59,540
achieve what they want

5867
07:28:59,540 --> 07:29:01,540
so I'm like even though

5868
07:29:01,540 --> 07:29:03,540
I'm stressed

5869
07:29:03,540 --> 07:29:05,540
and I'm worried and I'm this and I'm

5870
07:29:05,540 --> 07:29:07,540
that because

5871
07:29:07,540 --> 07:29:09,540
they are a much more important

5872
07:29:09,540 --> 07:29:11,540
focus on my life

5873
07:29:11,540 --> 07:29:13,540
it's kind of one of those things where I can

5874
07:29:13,540 --> 07:29:15,540
just put it to the side for now

5875
07:29:15,540 --> 07:29:17,540
and right okay

5876
07:29:17,540 --> 07:29:19,540
what's next once I get

5877
07:29:19,540 --> 07:29:21,540
offline I have some lovely VTubers

5878
07:29:21,540 --> 07:29:23,540
who are waiting on an ASMR collab from me

5879
07:29:23,540 --> 07:29:25,540
I have to send away shorts

5880
07:29:25,540 --> 07:29:27,540
for the girls I need to record that for them

5881
07:29:27,540 --> 07:29:29,540
um

5882
07:29:29,540 --> 07:29:31,540
like I need to do

5883
07:29:31,540 --> 07:29:33,540
um

5884
07:29:33,540 --> 07:29:35,540
yeah

5885
07:29:35,540 --> 07:29:37,540
um

5886
07:29:37,540 --> 07:29:39,540
every word is hard

5887
07:29:39,540 --> 07:29:41,540
to pronounce if you're bad enough for example

5888
07:29:41,540 --> 07:29:43,540
I pronounce spatula spatula

5889
07:29:43,540 --> 07:29:45,540
honestly

5890
07:29:45,540 --> 07:29:47,540
I think having

5891
07:29:47,540 --> 07:29:49,540
a purpose is really useful

5892
07:29:49,540 --> 07:29:51,540
in general yes I agree with that

5893
07:29:51,540 --> 07:29:53,540
I also do it that way

5894
07:29:53,540 --> 07:29:55,540
it's so tough to tackle

5895
07:29:55,540 --> 07:29:57,540
like men's socialization

5896
07:29:57,540 --> 07:29:59,540
because

5897
07:29:59,540 --> 07:30:01,540
where does it start it starts in the

5898
07:30:01,540 --> 07:30:03,540
home but then where

5899
07:30:03,540 --> 07:30:05,540
does it get affected

5900
07:30:05,540 --> 07:30:07,540
secondary socialization at school

5901
07:30:07,540 --> 07:30:09,540
like I don't know if you guys had this

5902
07:30:09,540 --> 07:30:11,540
but in Scotland

5903
07:30:11,540 --> 07:30:13,540
um

5904
07:30:13,540 --> 07:30:15,540
like

5905
07:30:15,540 --> 07:30:17,540
it became so quickly oh that's gay

5906
07:30:17,540 --> 07:30:19,540
to show any affection

5907
07:30:19,540 --> 07:30:21,540
in any sense in a basic

5908
07:30:21,540 --> 07:30:23,540
hug a basic handshake

5909
07:30:23,540 --> 07:30:25,540
um rubbing shoulders

5910
07:30:25,540 --> 07:30:27,540
against each other if you're both

5911
07:30:27,540 --> 07:30:29,540
you get you get and it starts

5912
07:30:29,540 --> 07:30:31,540
from there and then that isolation

5913
07:30:31,540 --> 07:30:33,540
progresses

5914
07:30:33,540 --> 07:30:35,540
further and further to the point

5915
07:30:35,540 --> 07:30:37,540
where the most

5916
07:30:37,540 --> 07:30:39,540
natural thing which is a reassuring

5917
07:30:39,540 --> 07:30:41,540
hug or embrace when you meet someone

5918
07:30:41,540 --> 07:30:43,540
you know um

5919
07:30:43,540 --> 07:30:45,540
becomes this almost

5920
07:30:45,540 --> 07:30:47,540
taboo unfamiliar

5921
07:30:47,540 --> 07:30:49,540
territory um

5922
07:30:49,540 --> 07:30:51,540
and it is such a shame that you even have

5923
07:30:51,540 --> 07:30:53,540
to experience that because

5924
07:30:53,540 --> 07:30:55,540
of the secondary socialization

5925
07:30:55,540 --> 07:30:57,540
because your primary socialization which is your family

5926
07:30:57,540 --> 07:30:59,540
um

5927
07:30:59,540 --> 07:31:01,540
you know I bet your dad came home and you gave him

5928
07:31:01,540 --> 07:31:03,540
a big hug like oh dad

5929
07:31:03,540 --> 07:31:05,540
and when you went and visited your grandparents

5930
07:31:05,540 --> 07:31:07,540
oh granddad grand

5931
07:31:07,540 --> 07:31:09,540
and gave him a wee kiss and a wee hug and all that

5932
07:31:09,540 --> 07:31:11,540
and it all goes out

5933
07:31:11,540 --> 07:31:13,540
the window because of

5934
07:31:13,540 --> 07:31:15,540
secondary socialization

5935
07:31:15,540 --> 07:31:17,540
yet behind closed doors

5936
07:31:17,540 --> 07:31:19,540
behind closed doors behind

5937
07:31:19,540 --> 07:31:21,540
in families perfectly normal

5938
07:31:21,540 --> 07:31:23,540
absolutely normal behavior

5939
07:31:23,540 --> 07:31:25,540
and it's very frustrating

5940
07:31:25,540 --> 07:31:27,540
because

5941
07:31:27,540 --> 07:31:29,540
to even think of how to

5942
07:31:29,540 --> 07:31:31,540
tackle it where do you

5943
07:31:31,540 --> 07:31:33,540
even start

5944
07:31:33,540 --> 07:31:35,540
because the way

5945
07:31:35,540 --> 07:31:37,540
it's set up is it's your

5946
07:31:37,540 --> 07:31:39,540
fault on an individual

5947
07:31:39,540 --> 07:31:41,540
level that you can

5948
07:31:41,540 --> 07:31:43,540
do these things that you can't hug

5949
07:31:43,540 --> 07:31:45,540
your bro that you get you meet up with once a month

5950
07:31:45,540 --> 07:31:47,540
um you can

5951
07:31:47,540 --> 07:31:49,540
it's your fault

5952
07:31:49,540 --> 07:31:51,540
because you didn't keep up

5953
07:31:51,540 --> 07:31:53,540
with that societal norm you

5954
07:31:53,540 --> 07:31:55,540
didn't break the more you like see how

5955
07:31:55,540 --> 07:31:57,540
it's so hard to break from society's grasp

5956
07:31:57,540 --> 07:31:59,540
at that point

5957
07:31:59,540 --> 07:32:01,540
someone says how's the game going

5958
07:32:01,540 --> 07:32:03,540
I'm so sorry I'm currently in a rant

5959
07:32:03,540 --> 07:32:05,540
about the social

5960
07:32:05,540 --> 07:32:07,540
um

5961
07:32:07,540 --> 07:32:09,540
education that you get after

5962
07:32:09,540 --> 07:32:11,540
sorry I'm fricking going on a rant again I can't

5963
07:32:11,540 --> 07:32:13,540
I can't stop myself

5964
07:32:13,540 --> 07:32:15,540
it's fascinating stuff when you start to really

5965
07:32:15,540 --> 07:32:17,540
break it down it becomes

5966
07:32:17,540 --> 07:32:19,540
almost frustrating

5967
07:32:19,540 --> 07:32:21,540
when you realize how bare bones

5968
07:32:21,540 --> 07:32:23,540
and simplistic humans are in nature

5969
07:32:23,540 --> 07:32:25,540
and yet we are

5970
07:32:25,540 --> 07:32:27,540
sorry I'm burping away

5971
07:32:27,540 --> 07:32:29,540
we are our own biggest enemies

5972
07:32:29,540 --> 07:32:31,540
we live in a society

5973
07:32:31,540 --> 07:32:33,540
literally

5974
07:32:33,540 --> 07:32:35,540
I'm typing that too

5975
07:32:35,540 --> 07:32:37,540
we live

5976
07:32:37,540 --> 07:32:39,540
we live in our society

5977
07:32:39,540 --> 07:32:41,540
that's it I'm typing that in chat

5978
07:32:41,540 --> 07:32:43,540
that's me getting it out there we live in our society

5979
07:32:43,540 --> 07:32:45,540
get that out

5980
07:32:45,540 --> 07:32:47,540
get that off your chest you're welcome to type

with all the conspiracy talk

6001
07:33:29,540 --> 07:33:31,540
I need you to do conspiracy theory

6002
07:33:31,540 --> 07:33:33,540
talking stream with Pippa it would be incredible

6003
07:33:33,540 --> 07:33:35,540
love your yapping

6004
07:33:35,540 --> 07:33:37,540
just can't wait to get enough of the adorable cut of it

6005
07:33:37,540 --> 07:33:39,540
oh I don't know if I would go too far

6006
07:33:39,540 --> 07:33:41,540
I've not had a chance to watch Pippa's content in a very long time

6007
07:33:41,540 --> 07:33:43,540
um

6008
07:33:43,540 --> 07:33:45,540
but I don't know if I would go too far

6009
07:33:45,540 --> 07:33:47,540
and I'm like

6010
07:33:47,540 --> 07:33:49,540
um

6011
07:33:49,540 --> 07:33:51,540
my ideas are quite

6012
07:33:51,540 --> 07:33:53,540
alienating

6013
07:33:53,540 --> 07:33:55,540
as much as we were meming on needy streamer overload

6014
07:33:55,540 --> 07:33:57,540
um

6015
07:33:57,540 --> 07:33:59,540
my

6016
07:33:59,540 --> 07:34:01,540
I know you're not really supposed to talk about any of that

6017
07:34:01,540 --> 07:34:03,540
you're supposed to be like tihi

6018
07:34:03,540 --> 07:34:05,540
but yeah I'm thinking you're never know

6019
07:34:05,540 --> 07:34:07,540
I plan on writing

6020
07:34:07,540 --> 07:34:09,540
a fairly long

6021
07:34:09,540 --> 07:34:11,540
fantasy of mine

6022
07:34:11,540 --> 07:34:13,540
I've had of you it's still cringe I want to

6023
07:34:13,540 --> 07:34:15,540
write it though as I was extremely pent up

6024
07:34:15,540 --> 07:34:17,540
after you do it

6025
07:34:17,540 --> 07:34:19,540
is pace been fine for this yes

6026
07:34:19,540 --> 07:34:21,540
I recommend it

6027
07:34:21,540 --> 07:34:23,540
oh no strong is a moon truth

6028
07:34:23,540 --> 07:34:25,540
oh god what's that I don't even know what that is

6029
07:34:25,540 --> 07:34:27,540
I don't know how I don't know if I'd go too far

6030
07:34:27,540 --> 07:34:29,540
she says when talking about the yabba

6031
07:34:29,540 --> 07:34:31,540
okay okay okay

6032
07:34:31,540 --> 07:34:33,540
it would be a race to see who will go too far

6033
07:34:33,540 --> 07:34:35,540
you're a Pippa

6034
07:34:37,540 --> 07:34:39,540
I'm like I'm probably

6035
07:34:39,540 --> 07:34:41,540
1984 dystopian

6036
07:34:41,540 --> 07:34:43,540
type

6037
07:34:43,540 --> 07:34:45,540
allegations

6038
07:34:45,540 --> 07:34:47,540
I don't know what

6039
07:34:47,540 --> 07:34:49,540
Pippa's field is in particular

6040
07:34:49,540 --> 07:34:51,540
but I am dystopian

6041
07:34:51,540 --> 07:34:53,540
based like whatever horrors of

6042
07:34:53,540 --> 07:34:55,540
man-made comprehension you can think of

6043
07:34:55,540 --> 07:34:57,540
have occurred

6044
07:34:57,540 --> 07:34:59,540
you know I'm like that kind of side of things

6045
07:34:59,540 --> 07:35:01,540
can you see

6046
07:35:01,540 --> 07:35:03,540
can you please say in the thickest island accent

6047
07:35:05,540 --> 07:35:07,540
eh

6048
07:35:07,540 --> 07:35:09,540
I cast

6049
07:35:09,540 --> 07:35:11,540
tongue positional awareness

6050
07:35:11,540 --> 07:35:13,540
sorry that's a really rough accent

6051
07:35:13,540 --> 07:35:15,540
but there you go

6052
07:35:15,540 --> 07:35:17,540
what's your favourite, Pringle's favourite

6053
07:35:17,540 --> 07:35:19,540
uh

6054
07:35:19,540 --> 07:35:21,540
paprika I love Pippa

6055
07:35:21,540 --> 07:35:23,540
Pippa is there and lizards are in government

6056
07:35:23,540 --> 07:35:25,540
literally 1984

6057
07:35:25,540 --> 07:35:27,540
Shawnee calls

6058
07:35:27,540 --> 07:35:29,540
yeah

6059
07:35:29,540 --> 07:35:31,540
Pippa is just psycho

6060
07:35:31,540 --> 07:35:33,540
she'll be, she'll go way too far quicker

6061
07:35:33,540 --> 07:35:35,540
okay

6062
07:35:35,540 --> 07:35:37,540
well we shouldn't egg her on how about we just

6063
07:35:37,540 --> 07:35:39,540
leave this as

6064
07:35:39,540 --> 07:35:41,540
eh

6065
07:35:41,540 --> 07:35:43,540
moon truth or believes the moon is a hologram

6066
07:35:43,540 --> 07:35:45,540
is the conspiracy theory made up to clown on

6067
07:35:45,540 --> 07:35:47,540
eh

6068
07:35:47,540 --> 07:35:49,540
that people actually started well

6069
07:35:49,540 --> 07:35:51,540
well

6070
07:35:51,540 --> 07:35:53,540
I have terrible news I'm afraid I don't meet much

6071
07:35:53,540 --> 07:35:55,540
of the requirements of a conspiracy theorist

6072
07:35:55,540 --> 07:35:57,540
eh I'm afraid that yes

6073
07:35:57,540 --> 07:35:59,540
our planet is in fact

6074
07:35:59,540 --> 07:36:01,540
around, oh dear

6075
07:36:01,540 --> 07:36:03,540
very controversial I know

6076
07:36:03,540 --> 07:36:05,540
it's okay it's okay you can unsubscribe

6077
07:36:05,540 --> 07:36:07,540
unsubscribe

6078
07:36:07,540 --> 07:36:09,540
at least it's not far and high

6079
07:36:09,540 --> 07:36:11,540
four five one yet right

6080
07:36:11,540 --> 07:36:13,540
oh

6081
07:36:13,540 --> 07:36:15,540
oh

6082
07:36:15,540 --> 07:36:17,540
yeah

6083
07:36:17,540 --> 07:36:19,540
yeah far and high four five one

6084
07:36:19,540 --> 07:36:21,540
yeah

6085
07:36:21,540 --> 07:36:23,540
what happens if the reason

6086
07:36:23,540 --> 07:36:25,540
why um

6087
07:36:25,540 --> 07:36:27,540
a lot of media

6088
07:36:27,540 --> 07:36:29,540
before

6089
07:36:29,540 --> 07:36:31,540
a certain year

6090
07:36:31,540 --> 07:36:33,540
was kind of scrubbed on a mass level

6091
07:36:33,540 --> 07:36:35,540
is so people realise

6092
07:36:35,540 --> 07:36:37,540
eh people don't know that

6093
07:36:37,540 --> 07:36:39,540
in a few hundred years I try to get a sense of that

6094
07:36:39,540 --> 07:36:41,540
we live in a society

6095
07:36:41,540 --> 07:36:43,540
where I go into the darkest and most remote

6096
07:36:43,540 --> 07:36:45,540
German forest and someone

6097
07:36:45,540 --> 07:36:47,540
still reports me because I pee

6098
07:36:47,540 --> 07:36:49,540
against a tree

6099
07:36:49,540 --> 07:36:51,540
true iron reaver true

6100
07:36:51,540 --> 07:36:53,540
right imagine burning books

6101
07:36:53,540 --> 07:36:55,540
ah ha ha ha ha

6102
07:36:55,540 --> 07:36:57,540
you're a round aether

6103
07:36:57,540 --> 07:36:59,540
unsubbed I can't believe it

6104
07:36:59,540 --> 07:37:01,540
the moon round

6105
07:37:01,540 --> 07:37:03,540
the sun round

6106
07:37:03,540 --> 07:37:05,540
the earth on a turtle's back

6107
07:37:05,540 --> 07:37:07,540
and world of warcraft

6108
07:37:07,540 --> 07:37:09,540
that's all I'm saying

6109
07:37:09,540 --> 07:37:11,540
the earth is round

6110
07:37:11,540 --> 07:37:13,540
oh wait isn't it not like a

6111
07:37:13,540 --> 07:37:15,540
there's like a certain name because it's like

6112
07:37:15,540 --> 07:37:17,540
a wonky round and not a perfect round

6113
07:37:17,540 --> 07:37:19,540
ah

6114
07:37:19,540 --> 07:37:21,540
something like that

6115
07:37:23,540 --> 07:37:25,540
uh have I shared any bibboots

6116
07:37:25,540 --> 07:37:27,540
I actually don't

6117
07:37:27,540 --> 07:37:29,540
share them with the girls

6118
07:37:29,540 --> 07:37:31,540
um

6119
07:37:31,540 --> 07:37:33,540
just because

6120
07:37:33,540 --> 07:37:35,540
I've I don't know

6121
07:37:35,540 --> 07:37:37,540
I just it's never really occurred to me to do

6122
07:37:37,540 --> 07:37:39,540
such a thing

6123
07:37:39,540 --> 07:37:41,540
an oval lumpy ball yeah

6124
07:37:41,540 --> 07:37:43,540
lumpy ball remember to check

6125
07:37:43,540 --> 07:37:45,540
your balls regularly

6126
07:37:45,540 --> 07:37:47,540
and if you find the lump

6127
07:37:47,540 --> 07:37:49,540
get it checked out

6128
07:37:49,540 --> 07:37:51,540
ladies and gentlemen

6129
07:37:51,540 --> 07:37:53,540
and before you go

6130
07:37:53,540 --> 07:37:55,540
it's embarrassing I assure you

6131
07:37:55,540 --> 07:37:57,540
the person who is doing the ultrasound

6132
07:37:57,540 --> 07:37:59,540
on your boss act has already

6133
07:37:59,540 --> 07:38:01,540
looked at about 10 sacks

6134
07:38:01,540 --> 07:38:03,540
that day already and within

6135
07:38:03,540 --> 07:38:05,540
that week has probably seen over a hundred

6136
07:38:05,540 --> 07:38:07,540
I assure you

6137
07:38:07,540 --> 07:38:09,540

6138
07:38:09,540 --> 07:38:11,540
unique okay get yourself

6139
07:38:11,540 --> 07:38:13,540
checked out if you are worried

6140
07:38:13,540 --> 07:38:15,540
an ultrasound

6141
07:38:15,540 --> 07:38:17,540
yeah that's what they do against your

6142
07:38:17,540 --> 07:38:19,540
um

6143
07:38:19,540 --> 07:38:21,540
if you have a bump you get an ultrasound

6144
07:38:21,540 --> 07:38:23,540
on your

6145
07:38:23,540 --> 07:38:25,540
resticle raggy

6146
07:38:25,540 --> 07:38:27,540

6147
07:38:27,540 --> 07:38:29,540
is it not an ultrasound I checked

07:38:29,540 --> 07:38:31,540
I'm clear oh I mean if you want to

6149
07:38:31,540 --> 07:38:33,540
I mean we could check live if you

6151
07:38:37,540 --> 07:38:39,540
times speed after hearing

6152
07:38:39,540 --> 07:38:41,540
back where you read my marrow

6153
07:38:41,540 --> 07:38:43,540

I found a lump

6156
07:38:47,540 --> 07:38:49,540
and they have no idea what it is some things can be

6157
07:38:49,540 --> 07:38:51,540
completely benign like

6158
07:38:51,540 --> 07:38:53,540

07:39:09,540 --> 07:39:11,540
rougher smooth feet question mark

6168
07:39:11,540 --> 07:39:13,540
um I have what's called

6169
07:39:13,540 --> 07:39:15,540
hyper hydrosis

6170
07:39:15,540 --> 07:39:17,540
um especially in my feet

6171
07:39:17,540 --> 07:39:19,540
and I do have it in my hands

6172
07:39:19,540 --> 07:39:21,540
um which means my hands

6173
07:39:21,540 --> 07:39:23,540
are always very smooth

6174
07:39:23,540 --> 07:39:25,540
um I have no dryness

6175
07:39:25,540 --> 07:39:27,540
because I am constantly

6176
07:39:27,540 --> 07:39:29,540
wet

6177
07:39:29,540 --> 07:39:31,540
really there's nothing else

6178
07:39:31,540 --> 07:39:33,540
to go off by um

6179
07:39:33,540 --> 07:39:35,540
but yes I always have like kind of moist

6180
07:39:35,540 --> 07:39:37,540
hands

6181
07:39:37,540 --> 07:39:39,540
um so they're always soft and so are my feet

6182
07:39:39,540 --> 07:39:41,540
are incredibly soft so yeah

6183
07:39:41,540 --> 07:39:43,540
there you go now you know

6184
07:39:43,540 --> 07:39:45,540
I was actually

6185
07:39:45,540 --> 07:39:47,540
going to do a donut on reward where

6186
07:39:47,540 --> 07:39:49,540
I give the like

6187
07:39:49,540 --> 07:39:51,540
for a second and third place like

6188
07:39:51,540 --> 07:39:53,540
high highs that I've worn but obviously

6189
07:39:53,540 --> 07:39:55,540
with my sweaty feet

6190
07:39:55,540 --> 07:39:57,540
constantly wet they're not like dripping

6191
07:39:57,540 --> 07:39:59,540
not dripping I don't need

6192
07:39:59,540 --> 07:40:01,540
Botox if you didn't know Botox

6193
07:40:01,540 --> 07:40:03,540
will paralyze the

6194
07:40:03,540 --> 07:40:05,540
sweat cells um

6195
07:40:05,540 --> 07:40:07,540
but they are constantly

6196
07:40:07,540 --> 07:40:09,540
having like a

6197
07:40:11,540 --> 07:40:13,540
they're not dry put it that way

6198
07:40:13,540 --> 07:40:15,540
most guys hands are like dry so

6199
07:40:15,540 --> 07:40:17,540
when you go like when you

6200
07:40:17,540 --> 07:40:19,540
rub your hands together it's like

6201
07:40:19,540 --> 07:40:21,540
but when I rub my hands well when I put

6202
07:40:21,540 --> 07:40:23,540
my hands together I can fart with my hands

6203
07:40:23,540 --> 07:40:25,540
because they're always

6204
07:40:25,540 --> 07:40:27,540
clammy and wet and yeah

6205
07:40:27,540 --> 07:40:29,540
that's very true

6206
07:40:29,540 --> 07:40:31,540
I can always do that

6207
07:40:31,540 --> 07:40:33,540
do it on command

6208
07:40:33,540 --> 07:40:35,540
I can never find this emote it's called flushed

6209
07:40:35,540 --> 07:40:37,540
that emote is called flushed

6210
07:40:37,540 --> 07:40:39,540
I can do that

6211
07:40:39,540 --> 07:40:41,540
breathe it in lads and lasses

6212
07:40:41,540 --> 07:40:43,540
well you are a cuddle fish I'd be concerned

6213
07:40:43,540 --> 07:40:45,540
if you were tonight you're so talented

6214
07:40:45,540 --> 07:40:47,540
sweaty hands aren't fun

6215
07:40:47,540 --> 07:40:49,540
it's a little bit annoying especially

6216
07:40:49,540 --> 07:40:51,540
gaming with a controller

6217
07:40:51,540 --> 07:40:53,540
because of the heat

6218
07:40:53,540 --> 07:40:55,540
transfer it reflects straight back

6219
07:40:55,540 --> 07:40:57,540
when I'm using a controller

6220
07:40:57,540 --> 07:40:59,540
fart hands being

6221
07:40:59,540 --> 07:41:01,540
when your hands are dry just hold

6222
07:41:01,540 --> 07:41:03,540
shiny I will I have

6223
07:41:03,540 --> 07:41:05,540
enough sweat to make your hands

6224
07:41:05,540 --> 07:41:07,540
nice and soft as well okay

6225
07:41:07,540 --> 07:41:09,540
there's enough to go around I assure you

6226
07:41:17,540 --> 07:41:19,540
but yeah

6227
07:41:21,540 --> 07:41:23,540
don't read this out loud

6228
07:41:27,540 --> 07:41:29,540
oh my god I'm getting intel

6229
07:41:29,540 --> 07:41:31,540
I'm getting intel

6230
07:41:31,540 --> 07:41:33,540
I know you said

6231
07:41:33,540 --> 07:41:35,540
you wouldn't ever approach other v-tubers

6232
07:41:35,540 --> 07:41:37,540
but considering the similarity of line of work

6233
07:41:37,540 --> 07:41:39,540
would you ever consider a collab with project melody

6234
07:41:39,540 --> 07:41:41,540
both of you seem very knowledgeable

6235
07:41:41,540 --> 07:41:43,540
and passionate about

6236
07:41:43,540 --> 07:41:45,540
positive A in education mental health

6237
07:41:45,540 --> 07:41:47,540
I feel like you would be great for us

6238
07:41:49,540 --> 07:41:51,540
I would never say no

6239
07:41:51,540 --> 07:41:53,540
but at this point in time

6240
07:41:55,540 --> 07:41:57,540
I'm just going to focus on getting the girls

6241
07:41:57,540 --> 07:41:59,540
their achievements stuff

6242
07:41:59,540 --> 07:42:01,540
I would never say no

6243
07:42:01,540 --> 07:42:03,540
but to reach out is quite

6244
07:42:03,540 --> 07:42:05,540
daunting

6245
07:42:05,540 --> 07:42:07,540
I'm sure anyone can kind of relate to that kind of thing

6246
07:42:11,540 --> 07:42:13,540
I would never say no

6247
07:42:13,540 --> 07:42:15,540
I've just said that

6248
07:42:15,540 --> 07:42:17,540
main project melody seems to be

6249
07:42:17,540 --> 07:42:19,540
like opposites

6250
07:42:19,540 --> 07:42:21,540
and yet the same type thing

6251
07:42:21,540 --> 07:42:23,540
with our kind of care and all that jazz

6252
07:42:23,540 --> 07:42:25,540
reefling intelligent agency

6253
07:42:25,540 --> 07:42:27,540
since you have hyper hydrolysis

6254
07:42:27,540 --> 07:42:29,540
do you keep yourself well hydrated

6255
07:42:29,540 --> 07:42:31,540
the way that I can tell

6256
07:42:31,540 --> 07:42:33,540
I'm actually severely dehydrated

6257
07:42:33,540 --> 07:42:35,540
as my hands go dry

6258
07:42:35,540 --> 07:42:37,540
that's when I know

6259
07:42:37,540 --> 07:42:39,540
I'm like up S Creek

6260
07:42:39,540 --> 07:42:41,540
basically as if my hands stop

6261
07:42:41,540 --> 07:42:43,540
my feet will never stop

6262
07:42:43,540 --> 07:42:45,540
I have never been aware of my feet

6263
07:42:45,540 --> 07:42:47,540
stopping sweating

6264
07:42:47,540 --> 07:42:49,540
lucky me

6265
07:42:49,540 --> 07:42:51,540
I was always so embarrassed

6266
07:42:51,540 --> 07:42:53,540
and as well I don't know if you guys have school dance

6267
07:42:53,540 --> 07:42:55,540
but I used to like

6268
07:42:55,540 --> 07:42:57,540
rub my hands on my trousers

6269
07:42:57,540 --> 07:42:59,540
like really quickly before I like

6270
07:42:59,540 --> 07:43:01,540
and I'm sure I bet you my dance partner

6271
07:43:01,540 --> 07:43:03,540
like whoever you got on the day

6272
07:43:03,540 --> 07:43:05,540
felt like I was doing it on purpose

6273
07:43:05,540 --> 07:43:07,540
like oh boy

6274
07:43:07,540 --> 07:43:09,540
and it's like no I have a really bad sweat problem

6275
07:43:09,540 --> 07:43:11,540
I don't want anyone to know about it

6276
07:43:11,540 --> 07:43:13,540
he he

6277
07:43:13,540 --> 07:43:15,540
she's just like me for real

6278
07:43:15,540 --> 07:43:17,540
for real

6279
07:43:17,540 --> 07:43:19,540
melody is dark and wholesome

6280
07:43:19,540 --> 07:43:21,540
yet darkly lewd

6281
07:43:21,540 --> 07:43:23,540
you're nerdy and yappy and intensively lewd

6282
07:43:25,540 --> 07:43:27,540
through the sneak

6283
07:43:27,540 --> 07:43:29,540
I've never been to a school dance

6284
07:43:29,540 --> 07:43:31,540
oh I guess maybe

6285
07:43:31,540 --> 07:43:33,540
not every country does it

6286
07:43:33,540 --> 07:43:35,540
but we had to learn like

6287
07:43:35,540 --> 07:43:37,540
Scottish traditional dance like the gay garden

6288
07:43:37,540 --> 07:43:39,540
did you say the gay garden

6289
07:43:39,540 --> 07:43:41,540
yes gay isn't happy ha ha ha we get it

6290
07:43:41,540 --> 07:43:43,540
we're

6291
07:43:43,540 --> 07:43:45,540
called gay garden

6292
07:43:45,540 --> 07:43:47,540
which means happy dance

6293
07:43:47,540 --> 07:43:49,540
never been to a school dance can't relate

6294
07:43:51,540 --> 07:43:53,540
I have hyperdologists too

6295
07:43:53,540 --> 07:43:55,540
so I'm constantly dehydrated

6296
07:43:55,540 --> 07:43:57,540
suck

6297
07:43:57,540 --> 07:43:59,540
had school dance here in New Zealand

6298
07:43:59,540 --> 07:44:01,540
it was similar

6299
07:44:01,540 --> 07:44:03,540
cause I hate having to wipe my hands

6300
07:44:03,540 --> 07:44:05,540
hi

6301
07:44:05,540 --> 07:44:07,540
hi Astrone

6302
07:44:07,540 --> 07:44:09,540
what sort of maros would you hate to receive

6303
07:44:09,540 --> 07:44:11,540
I don't know

6304
07:44:19,540 --> 07:44:21,540
what would I hate to receive

6305
07:44:21,540 --> 07:44:23,540
I don't know

6306
07:44:25,540 --> 07:44:27,540
nothing really

6307
07:44:27,540 --> 07:44:29,540
ha ha

6308
07:44:29,540 --> 07:44:31,540
I don't know nothing really gets me like

6309
07:44:31,540 --> 07:44:33,540
I can't even think of an example

6310
07:44:33,540 --> 07:44:35,540
I don't know maybe like

6311
07:44:35,540 --> 07:44:37,540
ask me to finish a game

6312
07:44:37,540 --> 07:44:39,540
I didn't finish or something

6313
07:44:39,540 --> 07:44:41,540
or be like you suck at this game

6314
07:44:41,540 --> 07:44:43,540
oh my heart you've got me

6315
07:44:43,540 --> 07:44:45,540
I can't believe it I can't believe I didn't finish every single game I've ever started

6316
07:44:45,540 --> 07:44:47,540
oh you got me

6317
07:44:47,540 --> 07:44:49,540
I don't know I can't think of an example

6318
07:44:53,540 --> 07:44:55,540
I think the force this is

6319
07:44:55,540 --> 07:44:57,540
dances at some point in primary middle

6320
07:44:57,540 --> 07:44:59,540
I went to a school dance

6321
07:44:59,540 --> 07:45:01,540
there was not a specific dance I had to learn

6322
07:45:01,540 --> 07:45:03,540
ah

6323
07:45:03,540 --> 07:45:05,540
never went to a dance but always to the after party

6324
07:45:05,540 --> 07:45:07,540
ooh ballin

6325
07:45:07,540 --> 07:45:09,540
everyone quick tried to get under her skin

6326
07:45:09,540 --> 07:45:11,540
why would you want under my skin

6327
07:45:15,540 --> 07:45:17,540
you'd rather be

6328
07:45:17,540 --> 07:45:19,540
I would say in it but hold on a minute

6329
07:45:19,540 --> 07:45:21,540
that doesn't sound right

6330
07:45:21,540 --> 07:45:23,540
hold on a minute there

6331
07:45:25,540 --> 07:45:27,540
you suck at Skyrim

6332
07:45:27,540 --> 07:45:29,540
when you're gonna finish it

6333
07:45:29,540 --> 07:45:31,540
oh you've got me

6334
07:45:31,540 --> 07:45:33,540
tell me how bad I am at the RDA side

6335
07:45:33,540 --> 07:45:35,540
oh

6336
07:45:35,540 --> 07:45:37,540
you've got me I can't believe it

6337
07:45:37,540 --> 07:45:39,540
I should probably drink my tea and then we'll jump back into Skyrim

6338
07:45:39,540 --> 07:45:41,540
that's right the tunes are on

6339
07:45:41,540 --> 07:45:43,540
tunes are on

6340
07:45:43,540 --> 07:45:45,540
okay I'm hydrating

6341
07:45:45,540 --> 07:45:47,540
I'm hydrating

6342
07:45:53,540 --> 07:45:55,540
she doesn't even know how to chase the RDA

6343
07:45:55,540 --> 07:45:57,540
oh you've got me I didn't know

6344
07:45:57,540 --> 07:45:59,540
to put the grenade launcher on

6345
07:46:01,540 --> 07:46:03,540
who would have thought a grenade launcher

6346
07:46:07,540 --> 07:46:09,540
I can't believe it I'm being

6347
07:46:09,540 --> 07:46:11,540
I'm being dunked on

6348
07:46:15,540 --> 07:46:17,540
I would probably say the thing

6349
07:46:17,540 --> 07:46:19,540
that would genuinely upset me the most

6350
07:46:19,540 --> 07:46:21,540
is if someone sent me something nasty

6351
07:46:21,540 --> 07:46:23,540
about the daughters

6352
07:46:23,540 --> 07:46:25,540
and obviously if that starts to appear

6353
07:46:25,540 --> 07:46:27,540
in the inbox I know it's

6354
07:46:27,540 --> 07:46:29,540
not to pay heed

6355
07:46:29,540 --> 07:46:31,540
but it's probably the worst thing I can imagine

6356
07:46:31,540 --> 07:46:33,540
but then again I was like

6357
07:46:33,540 --> 07:46:35,540
well you're subjecting me to that and not them

6358
07:46:35,540 --> 07:46:37,540
so

6359
07:46:37,540 --> 07:46:39,540
it is what it is

6360
07:46:43,540 --> 07:46:45,540
I like how she goes idle

6361
07:46:45,540 --> 07:46:47,540
I self defend

6362
07:46:47,540 --> 07:46:49,540
well it's actually for hunting

6363
07:46:49,540 --> 07:46:51,540
but

6364
07:46:51,540 --> 07:46:53,540
I think it can be used

6365
07:46:53,540 --> 07:46:55,540
for a distraction as well before I ink on you

6366
07:46:55,540 --> 07:46:57,540
I just ink on you and run away

6367
07:46:57,540 --> 07:46:59,540
like what you're gonna do about it

6368
07:46:59,540 --> 07:47:01,540
before you can even react I'm already gone

6369
07:47:05,540 --> 07:47:07,540
if you ever play a follow game

6370
07:47:07,540 --> 07:47:09,540
do you go for stats or stylists

6371
07:47:09,540 --> 07:47:11,540
oh stats

6372
07:47:11,540 --> 07:47:13,540
I absolutely cannot

6373
07:47:13,540 --> 07:47:15,540
for the life of me

6374
07:47:15,540 --> 07:47:17,540
by the pope

6375
07:47:17,540 --> 07:47:19,540
what

6376
07:47:21,540 --> 07:47:23,540
no way miss Morgan

6377
07:47:23,540 --> 07:47:25,540
that's hilarious

6378
07:47:25,540 --> 07:47:27,540
that's hilarious

6379
07:47:27,540 --> 07:47:29,540
congrats on getting back

6380
07:47:29,540 --> 07:47:31,540
hopefully work went well

6381
07:47:31,540 --> 07:47:33,540
and it wasn't too painful or perishing

6382
07:47:33,540 --> 07:47:35,540
that's absolutely hilarious

6383
07:47:35,540 --> 07:47:37,540
thank you for the tip

6384
07:47:39,540 --> 07:47:41,540
inks on you leaves refuses to elaborate

6385
07:47:41,540 --> 07:47:43,540
like an absolute chattel fish

6386
07:47:43,540 --> 07:47:45,540
that's right chattel fish I'll take that title

6387
07:47:45,540 --> 07:47:47,540
she blasted on me and ran away

6388
07:47:47,540 --> 07:47:49,540
what if I ink faster than you

6389
07:47:49,540 --> 07:47:51,540
one minute 56 I think

6390
07:47:51,540 --> 07:47:53,540
beat that good luck

6391
07:47:53,540 --> 07:47:55,540
like you can't

6392
07:47:55,540 --> 07:47:57,540
you literally can't beat that record I'm sorry

6393
07:48:01,540 --> 07:48:03,540
okay I finished my tea

6394
07:48:03,540 --> 07:48:05,540
right let's see about actually getting

6395
07:48:05,540 --> 07:48:07,540
oh wait no I was in the sky room

6396
07:48:07,540 --> 07:48:09,540
but now I need to turn my controller on

6397
07:48:09,540 --> 07:48:11,540
I

6398
07:48:11,540 --> 07:48:13,540
I

6399
07:48:13,540 --> 07:48:15,540
go to sleep

6400
07:48:15,540 --> 07:48:17,540
I'm gonna sneeze

6401
07:48:17,540 --> 07:48:19,540
I'm gonna sneeze

6402
07:48:21,540 --> 07:48:23,540
okay there we go

6403
07:48:23,540 --> 07:48:25,540
where are we heading

6404
07:48:25,540 --> 07:48:27,540
I need to get a letter

6405
07:48:27,540 --> 07:48:29,540
so I'm going to do some sacred things

6406
07:48:31,540 --> 07:48:33,540
my ears oh sorry I forgot

6407
07:48:33,540 --> 07:48:35,540
I'm a loud sneezer my apologies

6408
07:48:35,540 --> 07:48:37,540
hopefully that wasn't too bad

6409
07:48:37,540 --> 07:48:39,540
get some height

6410
07:48:39,540 --> 07:48:41,540

6411
07:48:41,540 --> 07:48:43,540

6414
07:48:47,540 --> 07:48:49,540
oh no no I just wiped my snot on your hoodie

6415
07:48:49,540 --> 07:48:51,540
I don't need a tissue

6416
07:48:51,540 --> 07:48:53,540
just give me your hoodie

6417
07:48:53,540 --> 07:48:55,540

6422
07:49:03,540 --> 07:49:05,540
alright just use my sleeve

6423
07:49:05,540 --> 07:49:07,540
she suddenly started a mustang

6424
07:49:11,540 --> 07:49:13,540
how did you manage to finish that early

6425
07:49:17,540 --> 07:49:19,540
you know guys aren't the only

6426
07:49:19,540 --> 07:49:21,540
one that

6427
07:49:21,540 --> 07:49:23,540
might have a bit of the

6428
07:49:23,540 --> 07:49:25,540
cream

6429
07:49:25,540 --> 07:49:27,540
and yeah

6430
07:49:27,540 --> 07:49:29,540
I'm a bit of a fiend

6431
07:49:29,540 --> 07:49:31,540
for it so

6432
07:49:31,540 --> 07:49:33,540
yep

6433
07:49:33,540 --> 07:49:35,540
at ease

6434
07:49:35,540 --> 07:49:37,540
at ease

6435
07:49:37,540 --> 07:49:39,540
I can't get this quest started

6436
07:49:39,540 --> 07:49:41,540
don't want to do that one

6437
07:49:41,540 --> 07:49:43,540
retrieve the

6438
07:49:43,540 --> 07:49:45,540
sure we can do that

6439
07:49:45,540 --> 07:49:47,540
we'll go retrieve the glove whilst we get the courier

6440
07:49:47,540 --> 07:49:49,540
to do his thing

6441
07:49:49,540 --> 07:49:51,540
the glove the horn

6442
07:49:51,540 --> 07:49:53,540
how much would you guys pay for that

6443
07:49:53,540 --> 07:49:55,540
hoodie

6444
07:49:55,540 --> 07:49:57,540
just come to the convention I'll snot on it for free

6445
07:49:57,540 --> 07:49:59,540
just bring grass pollen

6446
07:49:59,540 --> 07:50:01,540
or flowers

6447
07:50:01,540 --> 07:50:03,540
in a way I'm like really allergic to that stuff

6448
07:50:03,540 --> 07:50:05,540
can't go outside

6449
07:50:07,540 --> 07:50:09,540
which is funny because I have

6450
07:50:09,540 --> 07:50:11,540
a seed collection which I really enjoy

6451
07:50:11,540 --> 07:50:13,540
but of course seeds don't have pollen

6452
07:50:13,540 --> 07:50:15,540
issues on them although collecting them

6453
07:50:15,540 --> 07:50:17,540
sometimes can have traces of pollen

6454
07:50:17,540 --> 07:50:19,540
but it's not really a big deal like if you know what you're doing

6455
07:50:21,540 --> 07:50:23,540
a snot

6456
07:50:25,540 --> 07:50:27,540
okay okay okay our first dragon

6457
07:50:27,540 --> 07:50:29,540
come land okay it's just a basic

6458
07:50:29,540 --> 07:50:31,540
dragon

6459
07:50:31,540 --> 07:50:33,540
please land

6460
07:50:33,540 --> 07:50:35,540
please land

6461
07:50:37,540 --> 07:50:39,540
oh

6462
07:50:39,540 --> 07:50:41,540
of course it resisted soul trap

6463
07:50:41,540 --> 07:50:43,540
it's a dragon

6464
07:50:43,540 --> 07:50:45,540
I'm the freaking

6465
07:50:45,540 --> 07:50:47,540
soul gem for the dragon I don't know where we're

6466
07:50:47,540 --> 07:50:49,540
pretending otherwise

6467
07:50:49,540 --> 07:50:51,540
oh

6468
07:50:51,540 --> 07:50:53,540
hold on

6469
07:50:53,540 --> 07:50:55,540
must have on his little there we go

6470
07:50:55,540 --> 07:50:57,540
I had just emptied like

6471
07:50:57,540 --> 07:50:59,540
all of my inventory only to pick all of that up again

6472
07:51:03,540 --> 07:51:05,540
that was quite a reaction

6473
07:51:05,540 --> 07:51:07,540
wait what did I do

6474
07:51:07,540 --> 07:51:09,540
did I make a funny noise seed collection

6475
07:51:09,540 --> 07:51:11,540
yeah you didn't see my stream yesterday

6476
07:51:11,540 --> 07:51:13,540
I showed off my seed collection

6477
07:51:13,540 --> 07:51:15,540
at like one hour in

6478
07:51:15,540 --> 07:51:17,540
mud crab down

6479
07:51:19,540 --> 07:51:21,540
obliterate that dragons one

6480
07:51:21,540 --> 07:51:23,540
ankle I know I smashed it

6481
07:51:23,540 --> 07:51:25,540
into dust and he is like okay I'm done

6482
07:51:25,540 --> 07:51:27,540
I'm done here

6483
07:51:29,540 --> 07:51:31,540
wow that was really easy

6484
07:51:31,540 --> 07:51:33,540
what a bad dragon

6485
07:51:41,540 --> 07:51:43,540
you don't have to tell me twice I'll keep cracking these

6486
07:51:43,540 --> 07:51:45,540
jokes all day long

6487
07:51:45,540 --> 07:51:47,540
I love hearing you narrative about your seeds

6488
07:51:47,540 --> 07:51:49,540
I can do like an actual informal

6489
07:51:49,540 --> 07:51:51,540
informational stream

6490
07:51:51,540 --> 07:51:53,540
I think there's four ways of seed dispersal

6491
07:51:53,540 --> 07:51:55,540
air

6492
07:51:55,540 --> 07:51:57,540
hook

6493
07:51:57,540 --> 07:51:59,540
berry

07:51:59,540 --> 07:52:01,540
is there one more

6495
07:52:01,540 --> 07:52:03,540
is it chippers

6496
07:52:03,540 --> 07:52:05,540
like strawberries and potato

6497
07:52:05,540 --> 07:52:07,540
I think I need to beat the absolute

6498
07:52:07,540 --> 07:52:09,540
yeah I need to beat

6499
07:52:09,540 --> 07:52:11,540

ASMR thank you

6530
07:53:19,540 --> 07:53:21,540

there should be a skeleton here

6549
07:54:03,540 --> 07:54:05,540
on the outskirts

6550
07:54:05,540 --> 07:54:07,540

6551
07:54:07,540 --> 07:54:09,540

uh you can just go this way

6557
07:54:19,540 --> 07:54:21,540
if you really don't want to do the fight

6558
07:54:21,540 --> 07:54:23,540
Lydia should actually clean up

6559
07:54:23,540 --> 07:54:25,540
any enemies

6560
07:54:25,540 --> 07:54:27,540

6561
07:54:27,540 --> 07:54:29,540
so many soul gems

6562
07:54:29,540 --> 07:54:31,540
I'm gonna make so much money

6563
07:54:31,540 --> 07:54:33,540
selling all the enchanted

6564
07:54:33,540 --> 07:54:35,540
jewelry

6565
07:54:35,540 --> 07:54:37,540
what's going on in here

6566
07:54:37,540 --> 07:54:39,540
I can never remember

6567
07:54:39,540 --> 07:54:41,540
I think there's something back there

6568
07:54:43,540 --> 07:54:45,540
a hint

6569
07:54:45,540 --> 07:54:47,540
oh my god I'm getting so many

6570
07:54:47,540 --> 07:54:49,540
fricking souls

6571
07:54:49,540 --> 07:54:51,540
might as well call this game

6572
07:54:51,540 --> 07:54:53,540
George what's that one do

6573
07:54:55,540 --> 07:54:57,540
what is this

6574
07:54:57,540 --> 07:54:59,540
oh an enchantment room where are the odds

6575
07:54:59,540 --> 07:55:01,540
literally the very thing that I'm here for

6576
07:55:01,540 --> 07:55:03,540
well not here for

6577
07:55:03,540 --> 07:55:05,540
cause I'm actually doing a quest

6578
07:55:05,540 --> 07:55:07,540
alright okay sure take the dagger

6579
07:55:09,540 --> 07:55:11,540
200 feels so good

6580
07:55:11,540 --> 07:55:13,540
right so I can

6581
07:55:13,540 --> 07:55:15,540
I can enchant this

6582
07:55:15,540 --> 07:55:17,540
possibly with

6583
07:55:17,540 --> 07:55:19,540
soul trap

6584
07:55:19,540 --> 07:55:21,540
and then give it a

6585
07:55:21,540 --> 07:55:23,540
greater soul gem

6586
07:55:23,540 --> 07:55:25,540
these are all petty

6587
07:55:25,540 --> 07:55:27,540
okay give it a greater

6588
07:55:27,540 --> 07:55:29,540
and then the other stuff

6589
07:55:29,540 --> 07:55:31,540
will just shove anything on it

6590
07:55:31,540 --> 07:55:33,540
doesn't really matter

6591
07:55:33,540 --> 07:55:35,540
as long as we just get some

6592
07:55:35,540 --> 07:55:37,540
XP

6593
07:55:37,540 --> 07:55:39,540
we're at 44 already

6594
07:55:39,540 --> 07:55:41,540
fantastic

6595
07:55:41,540 --> 07:55:43,540
just shoving

6596
07:55:43,540 --> 07:55:45,540
anything on it

6597
07:55:49,540 --> 07:55:51,540
and these are worth a lot so as our

6598
07:55:51,540 --> 07:55:53,540
speech goes up we get even more money as time

6599
07:55:53,540 --> 07:55:55,540
goes on

6600
07:55:55,540 --> 07:55:57,540

08:00:47,540 --> 08:00:49,540

6728
08:00:49,540 --> 08:00:51,540
I need to be firmly planted to the ground at the convention

6729
08:00:51,540 --> 08:00:53,540

6730
08:00:57,540 --> 08:00:59,540

6731
08:01:05,540 --> 08:01:07,540

6733
08:01:09,540 --> 08:01:11,540
I don't know exactly

6734
08:01:11,540 --> 08:01:13,540
what you mean

6735
08:01:13,540 --> 08:01:15,540
there are enemies nearby

6736
08:01:15,540 --> 08:01:17,540
where

6737
08:01:17,540 --> 08:01:19,540
go and then who wants some

6738
08:01:21,540 --> 08:01:23,540

6739
08:01:23,540 --> 08:01:25,540

6740
08:01:25,540 --> 08:01:27,540

6742
08:01:29,540 --> 08:01:31,540

6743
08:01:31,540 --> 08:01:33,540

6744
08:01:33,540 --> 08:01:35,540

6745
08:01:35,540 --> 08:01:37,540

6746
08:01:37,540 --> 08:01:39,540

6747
08:01:39,540 --> 08:01:41,540

6748
08:01:41,540 --> 08:01:43,540
like

6749
08:01:43,540 --> 08:01:45,540

6750
08:01:45,540 --> 08:01:47,540
I do apologize for that one

6751
08:01:47,540 --> 08:01:49,540
I caught me by surprise

6752
08:01:49,540 --> 08:01:51,540
even though I've done it a few times now

6753
08:01:55,540 --> 08:01:57,540
good thing you don't have a mod

6754
08:01:57,540 --> 08:01:59,540
this is why we play vanilla cause

6755
08:01:59,540 --> 08:02:01,540
I would have probably forgotten

6756
08:02:01,540 --> 08:02:03,540

6757
08:02:05,540 --> 08:02:07,540

6796
08:03:41,540 --> 08:03:43,540

6797
08:03:43,540 --> 08:03:45,540

it's high time that you lie down

6801
08:03:53,540 --> 08:03:55,540
and bleed

6802
08:03:55,540 --> 08:03:57,540
slashing of steel

6803
08:03:57,540 --> 08:03:59,540
is a brave last matilda changing

6804
08:03:59,540 --> 08:04:01,540
full of zeal

6805
08:04:03,540 --> 08:04:05,540

6806
08:04:05,540 --> 08:04:07,540

6823
08:04:49,540 --> 08:04:51,540
my friend used that song

08:04:51,540 --> 08:04:53,540
for one of her classes and got an A

6825
08:04:53,540 --> 08:04:55,540
he yanked it and then submitted it as his own

6826
08:04:55,540 --> 08:04:57,540
that's actually really smart

6827
08:04:57,540 --> 08:04:59,540
astrid

6828
08:04:59,540 --> 08:05:01,540

6831
08:05:05,540 --> 08:05:07,540
does it matter

6832
08:05:07,540 --> 08:05:09,540
you're warm dry and still very much

6833
08:05:09,540 --> 08:05:11,540
alive

6834
08:05:11,540 --> 08:05:13,540
that's more than can be said for old

6835
08:05:13,540 --> 08:05:15,540
grailard

6836
08:05:15,540 --> 08:05:17,540
you know about that

6837
08:05:17,540 --> 08:05:19,540
half of skyrim knows

6838
08:05:19,540 --> 08:05:21,540
old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage

6839
08:05:21,540 --> 08:05:23,540
things like that tend to get around

6840
08:05:23,540 --> 08:05:25,540
oh but don't misunderstand

6841
08:05:25,540 --> 08:05:27,540
I'm not criticizing

6842
08:05:27,540 --> 08:05:29,540
it was a good kill

6843
08:05:29,540 --> 08:05:31,540
old crone had it coming

6844
08:05:31,540 --> 08:05:33,540
and you saved a group of urchins

6845
08:05:33,540 --> 08:05:35,540
to boot

6846
08:05:35,540 --> 08:05:37,540
but there is a slight

6847
08:05:37,540 --> 08:05:39,540
did we make a oopsie

6848
08:05:39,540 --> 08:05:41,540
a problem

6849
08:05:41,540 --> 08:05:43,540
you see that little erotino boy

6850
08:05:43,540 --> 08:05:45,540
was looking for the dark brotherhood

6851
08:05:45,540 --> 08:05:47,540
aha

6852
08:05:47,540 --> 08:05:49,540
and my associates

6853
08:05:49,540 --> 08:05:51,540
grailard the kind was by all rights

6854
08:05:51,540 --> 08:05:53,540
a dark brotherhood contract

6855
08:05:53,540 --> 08:05:55,540
a kill

6856
08:05:55,540 --> 08:05:57,540
that you stole

6857
08:05:57,540 --> 08:05:59,540
it's an honest mistake

6858
08:05:59,540 --> 08:06:01,540
you must repay

6859
08:06:01,540 --> 08:06:03,540
you want me to murder someone else

6860
08:06:03,540 --> 08:06:05,540
well now funny you should ask

6861
08:06:05,540 --> 08:06:07,540
if you turn around

6862
08:06:07,540 --> 08:06:09,540
you'll notice my guests

6863
08:06:09,540 --> 08:06:11,540
I've collected them from

6864
08:06:11,540 --> 08:06:13,540
well that's not really

6865
08:06:13,540 --> 08:06:15,540
important

6866
08:06:15,540 --> 08:06:17,540
and now that's what matters

6867
08:06:17,540 --> 08:06:19,540
you see

6868
08:06:19,540 --> 08:06:21,540
there's a contract out on one of them

6869
08:06:21,540 --> 08:06:23,540
and that person can't leave

6870
08:06:23,540 --> 08:06:25,540
this room alive

6871
08:06:25,540 --> 08:06:27,540
but oh

6872
08:06:27,540 --> 08:06:29,540
there's a contract

6873
08:06:29,540 --> 08:06:31,540
see if you can figure it out

6874
08:06:31,540 --> 08:06:33,540
hmm make your choice

6875
08:06:33,540 --> 08:06:35,540
make your kill

6876
08:06:35,540 --> 08:06:37,540
I just want to observe

6877
08:06:37,540 --> 08:06:39,540
and deny it

6878
08:06:39,540 --> 08:06:41,540
we will use our interrogations

6879
08:06:41,540 --> 08:06:43,540
alright I'll do it I'll kill one of them

6880
08:06:43,540 --> 08:06:45,540
see

6881
08:06:45,540 --> 08:06:47,540
I knew we could resolve this civilly

6882
08:06:47,540 --> 08:06:49,540
a debt owed must be repaid

6883
08:06:49,540 --> 08:06:51,540
you understand

6884
08:06:51,540 --> 08:06:53,540
oh we want to kill the spree now

6885
08:06:53,540 --> 08:06:55,540
we'll become serial killer overnight

6886
08:06:55,540 --> 08:06:57,540
pick your guest

6887
08:06:57,540 --> 08:06:59,540
and send the poor fool to the void

6888
08:06:59,540 --> 08:07:01,540

6889
08:07:01,540 --> 08:07:03,540

with six children and no husband

6933
08:08:49,540 --> 08:08:51,540

obtainer of goods

6946
08:09:21,540 --> 08:09:23,540

6947
08:09:29,540 --> 08:09:31,540

6948
08:09:31,540 --> 08:09:33,540

08:09:57,540 --> 08:09:59,540
this place reminds me of the dungeon

6953
08:09:59,540 --> 08:10:01,540
the blood everywhere and all the cages

6954
08:10:01,540 --> 08:10:03,540

6955
08:10:03,540 --> 08:10:05,540

6961
08:10:25,540 --> 08:10:27,540

6975
08:11:01,540 --> 08:11:03,540
as long as someone perishes

6976
08:11:03,540 --> 08:11:05,540
but there you go

6977
08:11:07,540 --> 08:11:09,540

6978
08:11:17,540 --> 08:11:19,540

08:17:41,540 --> 08:17:43,540

08:17:43,540 --> 08:17:45,540

I assure you

7124
08:18:07,540 --> 08:18:09,540
I wish I had one

7125
08:18:09,540 --> 08:18:11,540
I'm sorry I don't

7126
08:18:11,540 --> 08:18:13,540

7132
08:18:31,540 --> 08:18:33,540
dribbling in from time to time

7133
08:18:33,540 --> 08:18:35,540
I'll assign them to

7134
08:18:35,540 --> 08:18:37,540
you have one

7135
08:18:37,540 --> 08:18:39,540
completed at your leisure

7136
08:18:39,540 --> 08:18:41,540
since simple enough

7137
08:18:41,540 --> 08:18:43,540
it is

7138
08:18:43,540 --> 08:18:45,540
these aren't particularly glamorous assassinations

7139
08:18:45,540 --> 08:18:47,540
I'll be honest

7140
08:18:47,540 --> 08:18:49,540
don't pay much either

7141
08:18:49,540 --> 08:18:51,540
but they'll keep you busy

7142
08:18:51,540 --> 08:18:53,540
just do them as you're able

7143
08:18:53,540 --> 08:18:55,540
there's no real time limit

7144
08:18:55,540 --> 08:18:57,540
the targets aren't going anywhere

7145
08:18:57,540 --> 08:18:59,540
the targets

7146
08:18:59,540 --> 08:19:01,540
aren't going anywhere

7147
08:19:07,540 --> 08:19:09,540

let's see

7169
08:20:01,540 --> 08:20:03,540
there's a new lady in charge of the

7170
08:20:03,540 --> 08:20:05,540
she asked me to hand out these notices

7171
08:20:05,540 --> 08:20:07,540
to everyone I met

7172
08:20:07,540 --> 08:20:09,540
looks like that's it

7173
08:20:09,540 --> 08:20:11,540

7174
08:20:15,540 --> 08:20:17,540

of born strife the orphans of skyrim

7177
08:20:21,540 --> 08:20:23,540
true victims many have no one left to turn to

7178
08:20:23,540 --> 08:20:25,540
and face the life of hard labour poverty

7179
08:20:25,540 --> 08:20:27,540
and misery if you could provide a stable

7180
08:20:27,540 --> 08:20:29,540
home from one of these innocent children

7181
08:20:29,540 --> 08:20:31,540
please consider adoption whether you choose to

7182
08:20:31,540 --> 08:20:33,540
adopt from us or take in someone

7183
08:20:33,540 --> 08:20:35,540
closer to home you can

7184
08:20:35,540 --> 08:20:37,540
make a difference in a child's life for more

7185
08:20:37,540 --> 08:20:39,540
information inquire within

7186

those children a bit more

7192
08:20:53,540 --> 08:20:55,540
yes we are just going for a cheeky stab

7193
08:20:55,540 --> 08:20:57,540
yeah there should be someone

7194
08:20:57,540 --> 08:20:59,540
in a tent over here um

7195
08:21:01,540 --> 08:21:03,540
I don't know if we could

7196
08:21:05,540 --> 08:21:07,540
I could have sworn you can speak to this

7197
08:21:07,540 --> 08:21:09,540
person and they recognize you as

7198
08:21:09,540 --> 08:21:11,540
someone from the dark brotherhood but

7199
08:21:11,540 --> 08:21:13,540
they don't do anything about it I'm like

7200
08:21:13,540 --> 08:21:15,540
99% sure

7201
08:21:15,540 --> 08:21:17,540
why are you here get away from me

7202
08:21:17,540 --> 08:21:19,540
uh

7203
08:21:19,540 --> 08:21:21,540
you are right to be paranoid

7204
08:21:21,540 --> 08:21:23,540
what what do you mean

7205
08:21:23,540 --> 08:21:25,540
oh oh oh no

7206
08:21:25,540 --> 08:21:27,540

7208
08:21:29,540 --> 08:21:31,540
oh shit I missed wait

7209
08:21:31,540 --> 08:21:33,540
hold on

7210
08:21:33,540 --> 08:21:35,540
no

7211
08:21:35,540 --> 08:21:37,540
okay maybe I thought

7212
08:21:37,540 --> 08:21:39,540
he didn't run away

7213
08:21:39,540 --> 08:21:41,540
uh but I guess he did

7214
08:21:41,540 --> 08:21:43,540
uh right had I get to I'll just take

7215
08:21:43,540 --> 08:21:45,540
I'll just go westward from here

7216
08:21:47,540 --> 08:21:49,540
time to adopt six children for gen 2

7217
08:21:49,540 --> 08:21:51,540
oops let's not talk about gen 2

7218
08:21:55,540 --> 08:21:57,540
oh no

7219
08:21:57,540 --> 08:21:59,540
I love

7220
08:21:59,540 --> 08:22:01,540
that actively

7221
08:22:01,540 --> 08:22:03,540
wait you can't go that way

7222
08:22:03,540 --> 08:22:05,540
I love that actively when you talk

7223
08:22:05,540 --> 08:22:07,540
like when you do stuff in Skyrim

7224
08:22:07,540 --> 08:22:09,540
like the NPCs kind of discuss it

7225
08:22:09,540 --> 08:22:11,540
I think that's such a cool little

7226
08:22:11,540 --> 08:22:13,540
detail I have to admit for a game

7227
08:22:13,540 --> 08:22:15,540
for a game that came out in

7228
08:22:15,540 --> 08:22:17,540
2011 and was produced

7229
08:22:17,540 --> 08:22:19,540
like before that that was pretty

7230
08:22:19,540 --> 08:22:21,540
I don't give a that's pretty decent you know

7231
08:22:21,540 --> 08:22:23,540
like you're

7232
08:22:23,540 --> 08:22:25,540
gonna give it to them sometimes can't

7233
08:22:25,540 --> 08:22:27,540
can't give them all the credit but you gotta give it to them

7234
08:22:27,540 --> 08:22:29,540
sometimes uh unfortunately I believe

7235
08:22:29,540 --> 08:22:31,540
we do we have to go south

7236
08:22:31,540 --> 08:22:33,540
no we don't

7237
08:22:33,540 --> 08:22:35,540
I'm just taking super

7238
08:22:35,540 --> 08:22:37,540
long obnoxious way so I'm

7239
08:22:37,540 --> 08:22:39,540
going to teleport back and then I'm basically

7240
08:22:39,540 --> 08:22:41,540
just gonna go along the water's edge

7241
08:22:41,540 --> 08:22:43,540
to get to the stone store

7242
08:22:43,540 --> 08:22:45,540
death is highly overrated

7243
08:22:47,540 --> 08:22:49,540
infamous last words

7244
08:22:49,540 --> 08:22:51,540
IS the elusive warhammer

7245
08:22:51,540 --> 08:22:53,540
staff literally oh you didn't see it coming

7246
08:22:55,540 --> 08:22:57,540
just imagine how cool

7247
08:22:57,540 --> 08:22:59,540
Skyrim 2 will be

7248
08:23:01,540 --> 08:23:03,540
did they even announce it yet

7249
08:23:03,540 --> 08:23:05,540
or am I going crazy and they have

7250
08:23:05,540 --> 08:23:07,540
jeez how do I get down

7251
08:23:07,540 --> 08:23:09,540
I've not just done that have I

7252
08:23:09,540 --> 08:23:11,540
that'll be fine

7253
08:23:11,540 --> 08:23:13,540
that'll be fine on the old ankles

7254
08:23:13,540 --> 08:23:15,540
right maybe this will do

7255
08:23:15,540 --> 08:23:17,540
easy easy just

7256
08:23:17,540 --> 08:23:19,540
edge it a little bit

7257
08:23:19,540 --> 08:23:21,540
nice and slow slowly

7258
08:23:21,540 --> 08:23:23,540
slower

7259
08:23:25,540 --> 08:23:27,540
good boy

7260
08:23:27,540 --> 08:23:29,540
that's terrible

7261
08:23:29,540 --> 08:23:31,540
I shouldn't do that that's no need

7262
08:23:31,540 --> 08:23:33,540
you shouldn't egg me on either

7263
08:23:33,540 --> 08:23:35,540
Elder Scroll 6

7264
08:23:35,540 --> 08:23:37,540
is in development

7265
08:23:37,540 --> 08:23:39,540
okay okay

7266
08:23:39,540 --> 08:23:41,540
I could have sworn

7267
08:23:41,540 --> 08:23:43,540
they hardly freaking

7268
08:23:43,540 --> 08:23:45,540
talk about the damn thing

7269
08:23:45,540 --> 08:23:47,540
I can't with you oh my god

7270
08:23:47,540 --> 08:23:49,540
literally it's too easy

7271
08:23:49,540 --> 08:23:51,540
the problem is you give me too much power

7272
08:23:51,540 --> 08:23:53,540
and then I get high on it and I just

7273
08:23:53,540 --> 08:23:55,540
do it all the time

7274
08:23:55,540 --> 08:23:57,540
I'm not being funny that girl gave me far too

7275
08:23:57,540 --> 08:23:59,540
much power with me seeing them freezes

7276
08:23:59,540 --> 08:24:01,540
excuse you

7277
08:24:01,540 --> 08:24:03,540
excuse you

7278
08:24:03,540 --> 08:24:05,540
give me your soul

7279
08:24:05,540 --> 08:24:07,540
no

7280
08:24:07,540 --> 08:24:09,540
oh I'm out of soul gems

7281
08:24:09,540 --> 08:24:11,540
where the heck am I going

7282
08:24:11,540 --> 08:24:13,540
where the heck am I supposed to

7283
08:24:13,540 --> 08:24:15,540
go straight ahead

7284
08:24:15,540 --> 08:24:17,540
into the water

7285
08:24:19,540 --> 08:24:21,540
why not get a horse it takes too

7286
08:24:21,540 --> 08:24:23,540
long doesn't it I thought it tastes like

7287
08:24:23,540 --> 08:24:25,540
fruit and the horse aren't even that fast

7288
08:24:25,540 --> 08:24:27,540
don't you beat me up

7289
08:24:27,540 --> 08:24:29,540
I'll beat you

7290
08:24:29,540 --> 08:24:31,540
I'll smack you on your forehead it is

7291
08:24:31,540 --> 08:24:33,540
um

7292
08:24:33,540 --> 08:24:35,540
I don't mind giving you the power

7293
08:24:35,540 --> 08:24:37,540
you're still going strong

7294
08:24:37,540 --> 08:24:39,540
yeah sorry

7295
08:24:39,540 --> 08:24:41,540
I am

7296
08:24:41,540 --> 08:24:43,540
I am going to redirect into mercy

7297
08:24:43,540 --> 08:24:45,540
because unfortunately my achievements bugged out

7298
08:24:45,540 --> 08:24:47,540
so it kind of

7299
08:24:47,540 --> 08:24:49,540
may or may not have defeated

7300
08:24:49,540 --> 08:24:51,540
the whole purpose of this achievement

7301
08:24:51,540 --> 08:24:53,540
run

7302
08:24:53,540 --> 08:24:55,540
man we keep running into Talos

7303
08:24:55,540 --> 08:24:57,540
literally he was like that snake

7304
08:24:57,540 --> 08:24:59,540
and then he was like yeah I don't care

7305
08:24:59,540 --> 08:25:01,540
I can't I'm boss

7306
08:25:01,540 --> 08:25:03,540
I'm bossing on me

7307
08:25:03,540 --> 08:25:05,540
what if we

7308
08:25:05,540 --> 08:25:07,540
weflings get the power

7309
08:25:07,540 --> 08:25:09,540
anarchy

7310
08:25:09,540 --> 08:25:11,540
very classic if you power over me

7311
08:25:11,540 --> 08:25:13,540
bro if you're actually making me blush

7312
08:25:13,540 --> 08:25:15,540
you need to stop

7313
08:25:15,540 --> 08:25:17,540
I'm like oh my god a girl

7314
08:25:17,540 --> 08:25:19,540
me you like me

7315
08:25:19,540 --> 08:25:21,540
can't comprehend it

7316
08:25:21,540 --> 08:25:23,540
can't comprehend it doesn't make sense

7317
08:25:23,540 --> 08:25:25,540
what do you mean the Scottish accent

7318
08:25:25,540 --> 08:25:27,540
can you cringe out your boots

7319
08:25:27,540 --> 08:25:29,540
what do you mean

7320
08:25:29,540 --> 08:25:31,540
surely too much power

7321
08:25:31,540 --> 08:25:33,540
Talos knows

7322
08:25:33,540 --> 08:25:35,540
see I'm a little I'm walking in a Talos

7323
08:25:35,540 --> 08:25:37,540
north west

7324
08:25:37,540 --> 08:25:39,540
so I can't even talk

7325
08:25:39,540 --> 08:25:41,540
I'm getting flustered

7326
08:25:41,540 --> 08:25:43,540
thinking there's a girl watching me what the fuck

7327
08:25:43,540 --> 08:25:45,540
okay right I'm just

7328
08:25:45,540 --> 08:25:47,540
going to confess this straight off the bat

7329
08:25:47,540 --> 08:25:49,540
so I used to play Call of Duty

7330
08:25:49,540 --> 08:25:51,540
and whenever there was like a girl on my team

7331
08:25:51,540 --> 08:25:53,540
I used to get really flustered and I couldn't even talk properly

7332
08:25:53,540 --> 08:25:55,540
I just like completely clam up

7333
08:25:55,540 --> 08:25:57,540
and I'm just like uh uh uh

7334
08:25:57,540 --> 08:25:59,540
and I just get really like freaking terrible about it

7335
08:25:59,540 --> 08:26:01,540
so it's really I don't know why

7336
08:26:01,540 --> 08:26:03,540
I still haven't come over yet

7337
08:26:03,540 --> 08:26:05,540
because I played a few rounds of valorant and it happened

7338
08:26:05,540 --> 08:26:07,540
there was a girl on my team and I couldn't speak

7339
08:26:07,540 --> 08:26:09,540
at all in voice chat and I don't know what it is

7340
08:26:09,540 --> 08:26:11,540
and it's not even like

7341
08:26:11,540 --> 08:26:13,540
I'm trying to like impress her or anything

7342
08:26:13,540 --> 08:26:15,540
I just like get all weird and like

7343
08:26:15,540 --> 08:26:17,540
I don't want to bother her you know I'm being weird

7344
08:26:17,540 --> 08:26:19,540
oh

7345
08:26:19,540 --> 08:26:21,540
I'm like

7346
08:26:21,540 --> 08:26:23,540
it's not like I'm trying to like pick someone up

7347
08:26:23,540 --> 08:26:25,540
or anything and I'm like freaking Call of Duty

7348
08:26:25,540 --> 08:26:27,540
I don't know why I get all clammed up and it's happening

7349
08:26:27,540 --> 08:26:29,540
it's literally happening right now in live stream

7350
08:26:29,540 --> 08:26:31,540
and I'm like oh my god now everyone knows I'm a weirdo

7351
08:26:31,540 --> 08:26:33,540
and I'm like uh

7352
08:26:33,540 --> 08:26:35,540
talking to Wham is hard

7353
08:26:35,540 --> 08:26:37,540
okay

7354
08:26:37,540 --> 08:26:39,540
better not speaking and starting

7355
08:26:39,540 --> 08:26:41,540
to say bad jokes

7356
08:26:41,540 --> 08:26:43,540
she's just like the majority of guys

7357
08:26:45,540 --> 08:26:47,540
climbing up like basically every other

7358
08:26:47,540 --> 08:26:49,540
player of honestly

7359
08:26:51,540 --> 08:26:53,540
girls are still here

7360
08:26:55,540 --> 08:26:57,540
wait until she really is

7361
08:26:57,540 --> 08:26:59,540
so the reason

7362
08:26:59,540 --> 08:27:01,540
why it feels like it's different

7363
08:27:01,540 --> 08:27:03,540
for valorant girls is because

7364
08:27:03,540 --> 08:27:05,540
like I'm not trying to

7365
08:27:05,540 --> 08:27:07,540
I don't know

7366
08:27:09,540 --> 08:27:11,540
I'm not like trying to

7367
08:27:11,540 --> 08:27:13,540
you know get anything out of them

7368
08:27:13,540 --> 08:27:15,540
no that sounds really odd that makes it sound like I'm

7369
08:27:15,540 --> 08:27:17,540
freaking honing in that sounds really odd

7370
08:27:17,540 --> 08:27:19,540
hold on

7371
08:27:19,540 --> 08:27:21,540

08:27:51,540 --> 08:27:53,540

for the don star

7400
08:28:31,540 --> 08:28:33,540
based off of yesterday's stream

7401
08:28:33,540 --> 08:28:35,540
most of us can probably give you

7402
08:28:35,540 --> 08:28:37,540
the tip

7403
08:28:37,540 --> 08:28:39,540

I do have physical reactions

7407
08:28:45,540 --> 08:28:47,540
to like stressors and it can make them sweat

7408
08:28:47,540 --> 08:28:49,540
even more my left hand is currently soaked

7409
08:28:49,540 --> 08:28:51,540

are always going to come up to me unless I clear the bounty

7441
08:30:05,540 --> 08:30:07,540
could you imagine

7442
08:30:07,540 --> 08:30:09,540
you could start short circuiting

7443
08:30:09,540 --> 08:30:11,540
well that's why the plastic on like the controller

7444
08:30:11,540 --> 08:30:13,540
and that is really good for that

7445
08:30:13,540 --> 08:30:15,540
that issue

7446
08:30:15,540 --> 08:30:17,540
I got steam

7447
08:30:17,540 --> 08:30:19,540
I fear for the girl

7448
08:30:21,540 --> 08:30:23,540
I say

7449
08:30:23,540 --> 08:30:25,540

7450
08:30:25,540 --> 08:30:27,540

08:30:27,540 --> 08:30:29,540
I say that was terrifying

7452
08:30:31,540 --> 08:30:33,540
this is the riskiest

7453
08:30:33,540 --> 08:30:35,540
thing I've ever done

7454
08:30:35,540 --> 08:30:37,540
do not go down a waterfall whatever you do

7455
08:30:37,540 --> 08:30:39,540
by the way that's a terrible choice

7456
08:30:39,540 --> 08:30:41,540
can I teleport back to

7457
08:30:43,540 --> 08:30:45,540

7466
08:31:01,540 --> 08:31:03,540
when every time you speak makes me flustered

7467
08:31:05,540 --> 08:31:07,540

08:31:19,540 --> 08:31:21,540
legendary

7475
08:31:21,540 --> 08:31:23,540
I've been on it the entire time

7476
08:31:23,540 --> 08:31:25,540
I don't know why anyone thinks

7477
08:31:25,540 --> 08:31:27,540
I'm not on legendary for some reason

7478
08:31:27,540 --> 08:31:29,540
the proof is right on screen right now

7479
08:31:29,540 --> 08:31:31,540
so it's rather odd

7480
08:31:31,540 --> 08:31:33,540
rather

7481
08:31:33,540 --> 08:31:35,540
yeah see fair enough yeah

7482
08:31:35,540 --> 08:31:37,540
just the

7483
08:31:37,540 --> 08:31:39,540
oh wait hold on

7484
08:31:39,540 --> 08:31:41,540
look a little to the right again okay there you go boom

7485
08:31:41,540 --> 08:31:43,540
what do you mean see

7486
08:31:43,540 --> 08:31:45,540
where am I

7487
08:31:45,540 --> 08:31:47,540
oh I'm still running away from the guards

7488
08:31:47,540 --> 08:31:49,540
the guards aren't chasing me

7489
08:31:49,540 --> 08:31:51,540
they can be

7490
08:31:51,540 --> 08:31:53,540
I'm in the middle of a waterfall

7491
08:31:53,540 --> 08:31:55,540
the guards are chasing me

7492
08:31:55,540 --> 08:31:57,540
oh there's an in route

7493
08:31:57,540 --> 08:31:59,540
let's go get an in route

7494
08:31:59,540 --> 08:32:01,540
thank you for the tip again Miss

7495
08:32:01,540 --> 08:32:03,540
Morgan

7496
08:32:03,540 --> 08:32:05,540
I never doubt

7497
08:32:05,540 --> 08:32:07,540
what you mean me

7498
08:32:07,540 --> 08:32:09,540
in fact they have made

7499
08:32:09,540 --> 08:32:11,540
legendary for strong specifically because

7500
08:32:11,540 --> 08:32:13,540
the game was too easy

7501
08:32:13,540 --> 08:32:15,540
true Andrew

7502
08:32:15,540 --> 08:32:17,540
am I being

7503
08:32:17,540 --> 08:32:19,540
can I just

7504
08:32:19,540 --> 08:32:21,540
teleport to my location so I can

7505
08:32:21,540 --> 08:32:23,540
progress with my campaign

7506
08:32:23,540 --> 08:32:25,540
what is shooting bow and arrows at me

7507
08:32:25,540 --> 08:32:27,540
is that Lydia

7508
08:32:27,540 --> 08:32:29,540
is Lydia turned against me too

7509
08:32:29,540 --> 08:32:31,540
get me down the stream I'm a fish

7510
08:32:31,540 --> 08:32:33,540
I'm actually a fish get me

7511
08:32:33,540 --> 08:32:35,540
this is literally what it looks like from

7512
08:32:35,540 --> 08:32:37,540
the outside POV

7513
08:32:37,540 --> 08:32:39,540
you're just zooming down the rocks

7514
08:32:39,540 --> 08:32:41,540
okay can we

7515
08:32:41,540 --> 08:32:43,540
teleport now

7516
08:32:45,540 --> 08:32:47,540
yes we can

7517
08:32:47,540 --> 08:32:49,540
she's just so good guys honestly

7518
08:32:49,540 --> 08:32:51,540
I get so much

7519
08:32:51,540 --> 08:32:53,540
she might have changed or something

7520
08:32:53,540 --> 08:32:55,540
well I was going nope not at all

7521
08:32:55,540 --> 08:32:57,540
absolutely not definitely a

7522
08:32:57,540 --> 08:32:59,540
MLG gamer

7523
08:32:59,540 --> 08:33:01,540
and she tells you a problem

7524
08:33:01,540 --> 08:33:03,540
because I'm so good literally I don't know

7525
08:33:03,540 --> 08:33:05,540
why people seem to struggle not playing on legendary

7526
08:33:05,540 --> 08:33:07,540
oh Cicero

7527
08:33:11,540 --> 08:33:13,540
you dare risk disobedience

7528
08:33:13,540 --> 08:33:15,540
and surely

7529
08:33:15,540 --> 08:33:17,540
punishment

7530
08:33:35,540 --> 08:33:37,540
are you squiddin me right now

7531
08:33:37,540 --> 08:33:39,540
by the Pope

7532
08:33:41,540 --> 08:33:43,540
the benefits of being Scottish so use it

7533
08:33:43,540 --> 08:33:45,540
to your advantage as much as you can

7534
08:33:45,540 --> 08:33:47,540
okay

7535
08:33:47,540 --> 08:33:49,540
thank you for the tip Kitsune

7536
08:33:49,540 --> 08:33:51,540
use my Scottish accent

7537
08:33:51,540 --> 08:33:53,540
to my advantage

7538
08:34:05,540 --> 08:34:07,540
I think I might

7539
08:34:07,540 --> 08:34:09,540
or may not be

7540
08:34:09,540 --> 08:34:11,540
mildly

7541
08:34:11,540 --> 08:34:13,540
rather submissive at the moment

7542
08:34:13,540 --> 08:34:15,540
so I can't think of much to say

7543
08:34:17,540 --> 08:34:19,540
oh pardon me

7544
08:34:19,540 --> 08:34:21,540
putting out my weapon in the middle of a cutscene

7545
08:34:21,540 --> 08:34:23,540
Cicero

7546
08:34:37,540 --> 08:34:39,540
we've got business to discuss

7547
08:34:39,540 --> 08:34:41,540
do you have a contract for me

7548
08:34:43,540 --> 08:34:45,540
is this over for Marsh

7549
08:34:51,540 --> 08:34:53,540
feeling submissive feels like a huge hammer

7550
08:34:53,540 --> 08:34:55,540
honestly

7551
08:34:55,540 --> 08:34:57,540
why does Cicero sound like junk

7552
08:34:57,540 --> 08:34:59,540
oh why would you say something like that

7553
08:35:13,540 --> 08:35:15,540
I've already done that

7554
08:35:21,540 --> 08:35:23,540
nice Cicero

7555
08:35:25,540 --> 08:35:27,540
it's good to meet you too Cicero

7556
08:35:27,540 --> 08:35:29,540
just keep your distance Jester and we'll get along just fine

7557
08:35:29,540 --> 08:35:31,540
it's good to meet you

7558
08:35:37,540 --> 08:35:39,540
aww

7559
08:35:41,540 --> 08:35:43,540
I would like to keep him alive this time

7560
08:35:45,540 --> 08:35:47,540
why did you come to the sanctuary Cicero

7561
08:35:51,540 --> 08:35:53,540
come to Bravil

7562
08:36:01,540 --> 08:36:03,540
aggressive sub

7563
08:36:13,540 --> 08:36:15,540
how much did they spend on this

7564
08:36:15,540 --> 08:36:17,540
freaking voice actor Hughes

7565
08:36:17,540 --> 08:36:19,540
he nailed it

7566
08:36:19,540 --> 08:36:21,540
what are your duties of a keeper

7567
08:36:21,540 --> 08:36:23,540
tell me about yourself Cicero

7568
08:36:23,540 --> 08:36:25,540
not about the night mother

7569
08:36:25,540 --> 08:36:27,540
by the pope who goes there

7570
08:36:35,540 --> 08:36:37,540
thank you

7571
08:36:45,540 --> 08:36:47,540
nice Brian

7572
08:36:47,540 --> 08:36:49,540
for delivering that

7573
08:36:57,540 --> 08:36:59,540
have you got a pole

7574
08:36:59,540 --> 08:37:01,540
I want the pole if you've got a hole I want the hole

7575
08:37:01,540 --> 08:37:03,540
don't swap

7576
08:37:05,540 --> 08:37:07,540
you don't need a swap

7577
08:37:17,540 --> 08:37:19,540
the listener

7578
08:37:19,540 --> 08:37:21,540
what's a listener Cicero

7579
08:37:25,540 --> 08:37:27,540
Stroney's an equal opportunist

7580
08:37:27,540 --> 08:37:29,540
are you scooting me right now

7581
08:37:31,540 --> 08:37:33,540
you dislike Cicero

7582
08:37:33,540 --> 08:37:35,540
oh you don't like his character

7583
08:37:47,540 --> 08:37:49,540
our lady has not chosen

7584
08:37:49,540 --> 08:37:51,540
I mean like Cicero

7585
08:37:51,540 --> 08:37:53,540
I like to dislike Cicero

7586
08:37:53,540 --> 08:37:55,540
but Cicero is like trying to

7587
08:37:57,540 --> 08:37:59,540
a little rush

7588
08:37:59,540 --> 08:38:01,540
Stroney's such a good

7589
08:38:01,540 --> 08:38:03,540
right you're done

7590
08:38:03,540 --> 08:38:05,540
collectively you're done

7591
08:38:05,540 --> 08:38:07,540
oh wait I was supposed to hand in the contract

7592
08:38:07,540 --> 08:38:09,540
so we didn't pay attention

7593
08:38:09,540 --> 08:38:11,540
thank you for the tip anonymous

7594
08:38:11,540 --> 08:38:13,540
but no you got a pole keep the pole

7595
08:38:13,540 --> 08:38:15,540
you got a hole keep the hole

7596
08:38:15,540 --> 08:38:17,540
don't be swapping stuff around

7597
08:38:19,540 --> 08:38:21,540
there's a whole other conversation that can come out of that

7598
08:38:21,540 --> 08:38:23,540
but we can't even get into that

7599
08:38:29,540 --> 08:38:31,540
we're going to very slowly hand over

7600
08:38:31,540 --> 08:38:33,540
all the freaking things

7601
08:38:39,540 --> 08:38:41,540
that was lovely to be backdrop

7602
08:38:41,540 --> 08:38:43,540
thank you for the tip I appreciate that

7603
08:38:43,540 --> 08:38:45,540
I'm glad

7604
08:38:45,540 --> 08:38:47,540
I was worthy

7605
08:38:47,540 --> 08:38:49,540
to wait for

7606
08:38:49,540 --> 08:38:51,540
after all this time

7607
08:38:51,540 --> 08:38:53,540
it had been a while

7608
08:38:53,540 --> 08:38:55,540
I have to

7609
08:38:55,540 --> 08:38:57,540
make up for lost time

7610
08:39:03,540 --> 08:39:05,540
why you want to eat me

7611
08:39:05,540 --> 08:39:07,540
I don't even thought about that

7612
08:39:07,540 --> 08:39:09,540
oh yeah I want to eat calamarian stuff

7613
08:39:09,540 --> 08:39:11,540
no you're not supposed to want to eat it

7614
08:39:13,540 --> 08:39:15,540
thank you

7615
08:39:15,540 --> 08:39:17,540

7616
08:39:17,540 --> 08:39:19,540
pick one

7617
08:39:19,540 --> 08:39:21,540
I like how Lydia just respectfully

7618
08:39:21,540 --> 08:39:23,540
like hangs outside she's like yeah I'm not going to come in

7619
08:39:23,540 --> 08:39:25,540
it's not my problem

7620
08:39:25,540 --> 08:39:27,540
you are more than worth it thank you

7621
08:39:27,540 --> 08:39:29,540
I appreciate it

08:39:29,540 --> 08:39:31,540
there was a lot of

7623
08:39:31,540 --> 08:39:33,540
I don't know what the word is

7624
08:39:35,540 --> 08:39:37,540
I suppose emotional turmoil

7625
08:39:37,540 --> 08:39:39,540
is a bit of a dramatic

7626
08:39:39,540 --> 08:39:41,540
oh

7627
08:39:41,540 --> 08:39:43,540

that was it

7631
08:39:51,540 --> 08:39:53,540
swore swore

7632
08:39:53,540 --> 08:39:55,540
number 65 years in the past

7633
08:39:59,540 --> 08:40:01,540

I'd prefer it raw like sushi

7640
08:40:17,540 --> 08:40:19,540
we're not supposed to want to eat it

7641
08:40:19,540 --> 08:40:21,540
no

7642
08:40:21,540 --> 08:40:23,540
one year for this totally worth it

7643
08:40:23,540 --> 08:40:25,540
I'm freaking glad because

7644
08:40:25,540 --> 08:40:27,540
there was like yeah the emotional turmoil

7645
08:40:27,540 --> 08:40:29,540
like a lot of like

7646
08:40:29,540 --> 08:40:31,540
bad memories came back to the surface

7647
08:40:31,540 --> 08:40:33,540
but they got completely

7648
08:40:33,540 --> 08:40:35,540
manually overrated

7649
08:40:35,540 --> 08:40:37,540
just because of like

7650
08:40:37,540 --> 08:40:39,540
the love and like

7651
08:40:39,540 --> 08:40:41,540
everything that we didn't

7652
08:40:41,540 --> 08:40:43,540
like the girls

7653
08:40:43,540 --> 08:40:45,540
and I couldn't have predicted anything

7654
08:40:45,540 --> 08:40:47,540
at all

7655
08:40:47,540 --> 08:40:49,540
it was impossible to predict

7656
08:40:49,540 --> 08:40:51,540
and we were dealing with a major

7657
08:40:51,540 --> 08:40:53,540
calling at the time

7658
08:40:53,540 --> 08:40:55,540
which was really messing with

7659
08:40:55,540 --> 08:40:57,540
how to predict anything at all

7660
08:40:57,540 --> 08:40:59,540
okay but what were we supposed to do

7661
08:40:59,540 --> 08:41:01,540
with the fish

7662
08:41:01,540 --> 08:41:03,540
I can give it

7663
08:41:03,540 --> 08:41:05,540
explicit detail

7664
08:41:05,540 --> 08:41:07,540
would you like explicit detail

7665
08:41:09,540 --> 08:41:11,540
we love you love you little replay

7666
08:41:15,540 --> 08:41:17,540

7667
08:41:21,540 --> 08:41:23,540

7668
08:41:23,540 --> 08:41:25,540
right home that's all you have to do

7669
08:41:27,540 --> 08:41:29,540
nice and easy

7670
08:41:29,540 --> 08:41:31,540
wait is there someone here I need to perish

7671
08:41:31,540 --> 08:41:33,540
was that not just told to come in here

7672
08:41:35,540 --> 08:41:37,540
wait did I read the map wrong

7673
08:41:37,540 --> 08:41:39,540
I think I might read the map

7674
08:41:39,540 --> 08:41:41,540
map wrong

7675
08:41:43,540 --> 08:41:45,540
you hear about the story of a dude

7676
08:41:45,540 --> 08:41:47,540
who put a fish in his pants

7677
08:41:47,540 --> 08:41:49,540
no I did not is this bad

7678
08:41:53,540 --> 08:41:55,540
am I supposed to perish her

7679
08:42:03,540 --> 08:42:05,540
she's so messed up are you okay

7680
08:42:07,540 --> 08:42:09,540
her mother should have to bury her daughter

7681
08:42:09,540 --> 08:42:11,540
wait so why does

7682
08:42:11,540 --> 08:42:13,540
why does she have to be

7683
08:42:13,540 --> 08:42:15,540
perished

7684
08:42:15,540 --> 08:42:17,540
if it's optional I'm not actually gonna do it

7685
08:42:17,540 --> 08:42:19,540
cause that's really mean

7686
08:42:23,540 --> 08:42:25,540
I have a perfect mean for the situation

7687
08:42:25,540 --> 08:42:27,540
cherish the fish worship the fish

7688
08:42:27,540 --> 08:42:29,540
pour for all mortal possessions but no

7689
08:42:29,540 --> 08:42:31,540
no that is nothing

7690
08:42:33,540 --> 08:42:35,540
why are you shouldn't

7691
08:42:35,540 --> 08:42:37,540
oh you've just

7692
08:42:37,540 --> 08:42:39,540
attacked those bandits no wonder they're shouldn't

7693
08:42:39,540 --> 08:42:41,540
we need to go a little to the right

7694
08:42:45,540 --> 08:42:47,540
but I can forfeit the fish

7695
08:42:47,540 --> 08:42:49,540
best I can forfeit to fish is to

7696
08:42:49,540 --> 08:42:51,540
no keep it

7697
08:42:51,540 --> 08:42:53,540
no give money to fish

7698
08:42:53,540 --> 08:42:55,540
unless

7699
08:42:55,540 --> 08:42:57,540
is there even an unless

7700
08:42:59,540 --> 08:43:01,540
I don't even think there's really an unless

7701
08:43:01,540 --> 08:43:03,540
in that scenario

7702
08:43:03,540 --> 08:43:05,540
okay is it it's not that one

7703
08:43:05,540 --> 08:43:07,540
no it's up here

7704
08:43:09,540 --> 08:43:11,540
I'm not really sure

7705
08:43:11,540 --> 08:43:13,540
if I'm gonna be able to make it to this checkpoint

7706
08:43:13,540 --> 08:43:15,540
cause definitely not

7707
08:43:15,540 --> 08:43:17,540
supposed to be coming up the sheer cliff face of a mountain

7708
08:43:17,540 --> 08:43:19,540
only give money if you can afford it

7709
08:43:19,540 --> 08:43:21,540
yeah but even then

7710
08:43:21,540 --> 08:43:23,540
like there I feel like there's so many

7711
08:43:23,540 --> 08:43:25,540
attachments to it and it's like

7712
08:43:25,540 --> 08:43:27,540
only give it if you're financially stable

7713
08:43:27,540 --> 08:43:29,540
only give it if you

7714
08:43:29,540 --> 08:43:31,540
are like genuinely enjoying the content

7715
08:43:31,540 --> 08:43:33,540
only give it if

7716
08:43:33,540 --> 08:43:35,540
like you know you've treated

7717
08:43:35,540 --> 08:43:37,540
yourself and you know you've got

7718
08:43:37,540 --> 08:43:39,540
savings and all that and you're looking after

7719
08:43:39,540 --> 08:43:41,540
yourself like if you're in debt

7720
08:43:41,540 --> 08:43:43,540
or anything like that no

7721
08:43:43,540 --> 08:43:45,540
it's a big no no

7722
08:43:45,540 --> 08:43:47,540
like you don't need to be donating

7723
08:43:47,540 --> 08:43:49,540
to myself and I'm sure the via lure girls

7724
08:43:49,540 --> 08:43:51,540
all agree with me

7725
08:43:51,540 --> 08:43:53,540
like make sure you're sorted

7726
08:43:53,540 --> 08:43:55,540
out first make sure you're

7727
08:43:55,540 --> 08:43:57,540
secure first like having a good time

7728
08:43:57,540 --> 08:43:59,540
I swear to god if I read any of the comments

7729
08:43:59,540 --> 08:44:01,540
that go I'm living in a cardboard box

7730
08:44:01,540 --> 08:44:03,540

7731
08:44:03,540 --> 08:44:05,540

I don't I think I can just skip them

7751
08:44:43,540 --> 08:44:45,540
to be honest I'm gonna just skip them

7752
08:44:45,540 --> 08:44:47,540
we don't need to type

7753
08:44:47,540 --> 08:44:49,540
you're so sweet so based if you do that

7754
08:44:49,540 --> 08:44:51,540

sorry I know it's not a fair fight

7759
08:44:59,540 --> 08:45:01,540

7760
08:45:01,540 --> 08:45:03,540

7761
08:45:03,540 --> 08:45:05,540

but thank you very much for the

7770
08:45:25,540 --> 08:45:27,540
quick tip I pursued

7771
08:45:27,540 --> 08:45:29,540
way fish give

7772
08:45:29,540 --> 08:45:31,540
life lessons

7773
08:45:31,540 --> 08:45:33,540
I will always give life lessons

7774
08:45:33,540 --> 08:45:35,540
I think it's very important to consider

7775
08:45:35,540 --> 08:45:37,540
life experiences

7776
08:45:37,540 --> 08:45:39,540
an XP bar

7777
08:45:39,540 --> 08:45:41,540
and when you talk to people

7778
08:45:41,540 --> 08:45:43,540
and when you get to hear other perspectives

7779
08:45:43,540 --> 08:45:45,540
you are very slowly filling up that bar

7780
08:45:45,540 --> 08:45:47,540
and a very big

7781
08:45:47,540 --> 08:45:49,540
life lesson

7782
08:45:49,540 --> 08:45:51,540
can be

7783
08:45:51,540 --> 08:45:53,540
hold on hold on

7784
08:45:53,540 --> 08:45:55,540
I'm wrecking and decking right now

7785
08:45:55,540 --> 08:45:57,540
hey

7786
08:46:03,540 --> 08:46:05,540
oh right okay well

7787
08:46:05,540 --> 08:46:07,540
you weren't really I thought

7788
08:46:07,540 --> 08:46:09,540
okay that was really bizarre

7789
08:46:09,540 --> 08:46:11,540
is this book

7790
08:46:13,540 --> 08:46:15,540
do you also get XP

7791
08:46:15,540 --> 08:46:17,540
but you also get XP for hurting people

7792
08:46:17,540 --> 08:46:19,540
what just wait until you find

7793
08:46:19,540 --> 08:46:21,540
the one butthole

7794
08:46:21,540 --> 08:46:23,540
who's

7795
08:46:23,540 --> 08:46:25,540
just enough XP to level up

7796
08:46:25,540 --> 08:46:27,540
oh no like seriously

7797
08:46:27,540 --> 08:46:29,540
I don't mind talking about like oh

7798
08:46:29,540 --> 08:46:31,540
I can teach you guys about debt and how it works

7799
08:46:31,540 --> 08:46:33,540
and how credit cards work

7800
08:46:33,540 --> 08:46:35,540
I genuinely believe credit cards

7801
08:46:35,540 --> 08:46:37,540
are the absolute spawn of

7802
08:46:37,540 --> 08:46:39,540
Satan for lack of better words

7803
08:46:39,540 --> 08:46:41,540
they're terrible

7804
08:46:41,540 --> 08:46:43,540
and once you get sucked into them

7805
08:46:43,540 --> 08:46:45,540
and you're uneducated in them

7806
08:46:45,540 --> 08:46:47,540
it's like obviously not part of your curriculum

7807
08:46:47,540 --> 08:46:49,540
surprise surprise

7808
08:46:49,540 --> 08:46:51,540
I wonder why

7809
08:46:51,540 --> 08:46:53,540
oh that's right we're going down the conspiracy theory hole again

7810
08:46:53,540 --> 08:46:55,540
like gee willikers I wonder why you're not told

7811
08:46:55,540 --> 08:46:57,540
about how to do your taxes

7812
08:46:57,540 --> 08:46:59,540
properly I wonder how you're not told to

7813
08:46:59,540 --> 08:47:01,540
financially gee it's almost like

7814
08:47:01,540 --> 08:47:03,540
the world runs if people

7815
08:47:03,540 --> 08:47:05,540
are on debt because of the way society is

7816
08:47:05,540 --> 08:47:07,540
set up because we love capitalism

7817
08:47:09,540 --> 08:47:11,540
which is why I absolutely

7818
08:47:11,540 --> 08:47:13,540
do not

7819
08:47:13,540 --> 08:47:15,540
want any

7820
08:47:15,540 --> 08:47:17,540
like tips or support

7821
08:47:17,540 --> 08:47:19,540
you do not have to give me any monetary

7822
08:47:19,540 --> 08:47:21,540
um

7823
08:47:21,540 --> 08:47:23,540
for that kind of thing

7824
08:47:23,540 --> 08:47:25,540
based

7825
08:47:25,540 --> 08:47:27,540
oh literally

7826
08:47:27,540 --> 08:47:29,540
I could go on a massive essay

7827
08:47:29,540 --> 08:47:31,540
about that kind of thing

7828
08:47:31,540 --> 08:47:33,540

7829
08:47:33,540 --> 08:47:35,540

and on

7836
08:47:47,540 --> 08:47:49,540

7842
08:47:59,540 --> 08:48:01,540
I don't want to hear no

7843
08:48:01,540 --> 08:48:03,540
that's terrible don't say that

7844
08:48:03,540 --> 08:48:05,540
there's a safety word

7845
08:48:05,540 --> 08:48:07,540
no we use that

7846
08:48:09,540 --> 08:48:11,540

8131
09:01:43,540 --> 09:01:45,540

09:01:45,540 --> 09:01:47,540

power washer sim where you get to see us all together

8135
09:01:51,540 --> 09:01:53,540

09:01:53,540 --> 09:01:55,540
not naming names

8137
09:01:55,540 --> 09:01:57,540

8138
09:01:57,540 --> 09:01:59,540
reason why we're playing power washer first

8139
09:01:59,540 --> 09:02:01,540
out of all the games

8140
09:02:01,540 --> 09:02:03,540

8141
09:02:03,540 --> 09:02:05,540
freaking plot was

8142
09:02:05,540 --> 09:02:07,540

09:02:33,540 --> 09:02:35,540
endurance but it was almost a fool endurance

8157
09:02:35,540 --> 09:02:37,540

09:02:41,540 --> 09:02:43,540
monetization celebration so be there

8161
09:02:43,540 --> 09:02:45,540
or be a square

8162
09:02:45,540 --> 09:02:47,540
um I won't be up for too long definitely

8163
09:02:47,540 --> 09:02:49,540
non endurance stream but please don't worry

8164
09:02:49,540 --> 09:02:51,540
if you can't make it the void will remain

8165
09:02:51,540 --> 09:02:53,540
up I will be a good girl

8166
09:02:55,540 --> 09:02:57,540
just like you you'll be a good boy

8167
09:02:57,540 --> 09:02:59,540
wouldn't you

8168
09:02:59,540 --> 09:03:01,540
or a good girl

8169
09:03:03,540 --> 09:03:05,540
yeah only nine over stream

8170
09:03:05,540 --> 09:03:07,540

but yes we will be good together

8172
09:03:11,540 --> 09:03:13,540
and we don't need to worry

8173
09:03:13,540 --> 09:03:15,540
um it should remain up

8174
09:03:15,540 --> 09:03:17,540
and

8175
09:03:17,540 --> 09:03:19,540
uh I think that's everything I

8176
09:03:19,540 --> 09:03:21,540
have to say it's possible

8177
09:03:21,540 --> 09:03:23,540
do we have

8178
09:03:23,540 --> 09:03:25,540
to stagger our monetization celebration

8179
09:03:25,540 --> 09:03:27,540
days

8180
09:03:27,540 --> 09:03:29,540
or can I

8181
09:03:29,540 --> 09:03:31,540
if I did two if I did two hours

8182
09:03:31,540 --> 09:03:33,540
and then perfectly read into chibi

8183
09:03:33,540 --> 09:03:35,540
yeah that's fine

8184
09:03:35,540 --> 09:03:37,540
if she decides to do hers as well

8185
09:03:37,540 --> 09:03:39,540
because I'm not going to tell her not to do it you know

8186
09:03:39,540 --> 09:03:41,540
I'm not going to say no

8187
09:03:41,540 --> 09:03:43,540
six I was shaking my head

8188
09:03:43,540 --> 09:03:45,540
I'm such a fake gamer I can't believe

8189
09:03:45,540 --> 09:03:47,540
I'm such a rubbish streamer nine hours

8190
09:03:47,540 --> 09:03:49,540
she said again

8191
09:03:49,540 --> 09:03:51,540
okay I have to learn that being called a good boys

8192
09:03:51,540 --> 09:03:53,540
okay I've learned

8193
09:03:53,540 --> 09:03:55,540
that being called a good boys move

8194
09:03:55,540 --> 09:03:57,540
oh it's supposed to make you weak in the knees

8195
09:03:59,540 --> 09:04:01,540
you're supposed to get weak in the knees for me

8196
09:04:01,540 --> 09:04:03,540
it's simple okay

8197
09:04:03,540 --> 09:04:05,540
you behave

8198
09:04:05,540 --> 09:04:07,540
you get rewarded

8199
09:04:07,540 --> 09:04:09,540
a very fair

8200
09:04:09,540 --> 09:04:11,540
and simple exchange

8201
09:04:11,540 --> 09:04:13,540
oh you

8202
09:04:13,540 --> 09:04:15,540
do have to go to 599

8203
09:04:15,540 --> 09:04:17,540
to avoid gifting you're joking

8204
09:04:19,540 --> 09:04:21,540
please tell me you're trolling me and it's not 599

8205
09:04:23,540 --> 09:04:25,540
is it actually 599

8206
09:04:27,540 --> 09:04:29,540
I don't think I can charge that much

8207
09:04:29,540 --> 09:04:31,540
that's not fair

8208
09:04:39,540 --> 09:04:41,540
why

8209
09:04:41,540 --> 09:04:43,540
did gifting change

8210
09:04:43,540 --> 09:04:45,540
does gifting not go to the lowest tier

8211
09:04:45,540 --> 09:04:47,540
are we sure gifting doesn't do the lowest tier

8212
09:04:49,540 --> 09:04:51,540
what's gifting so when someone

8213
09:04:51,540 --> 09:04:53,540
is monetized you can gift

8214
09:04:53,540 --> 09:04:55,540
membership to other people

8215
09:04:55,540 --> 09:04:57,540
and

8216
09:04:59,540 --> 09:05:01,540
I specifically

8217
09:05:01,540 --> 09:05:03,540
I'm having

8218
09:05:03,540 --> 09:05:05,540
you know what

8219
09:05:05,540 --> 09:05:07,540
we could test it on me

8220
09:05:09,540 --> 09:05:11,540
we could test it on me tomorrow

8221
09:05:13,540 --> 09:05:15,540
I know how to

8222
09:05:15,540 --> 09:05:17,540
dance the line

8223
09:05:17,540 --> 09:05:19,540
okay

8224
09:05:19,540 --> 09:05:21,540
we'll test it on me tomorrow we'll see what happens

8225
09:05:21,540 --> 09:05:23,540
strongy speaks

8226
09:05:23,540 --> 09:05:25,540
English

8227
09:05:25,540 --> 09:05:27,540
strongy speaks and my heart becomes weak

8228
09:05:27,540 --> 09:05:29,540
100% sure it doesn't

8229
09:05:29,540 --> 09:05:31,540
seen tons of channels with 199

8230
09:05:31,540 --> 09:05:33,540
it goes from 499

8231
09:05:35,540 --> 09:05:37,540
let me cook

8232
09:05:37,540 --> 09:05:39,540
and I'll put the price that I want

8233
09:05:39,540 --> 09:05:41,540
and I think it's fair and we'll see what happens

8234
09:05:41,540 --> 09:05:43,540
and if it's just an absolute cluster

8235
09:05:43,540 --> 09:05:45,540
minuster then

8236
09:05:45,540 --> 09:05:47,540
we'll deal with the fallout on me at least

8237
09:05:47,540 --> 09:05:49,540
and then the girls are unaffected by

8238
09:05:49,540 --> 09:05:51,540
any fallout

8239
09:05:53,540 --> 09:05:55,540
the fear

8240
09:05:55,540 --> 09:05:57,540
of that thingy but I've never seen it happen

8241
09:05:57,540 --> 09:05:59,540
nah and it's like

8242
09:05:59,540 --> 09:06:01,540
you have to turn on being able to be gifted

8243
09:06:01,540 --> 09:06:03,540
yes I would

8244
09:06:03,540 --> 09:06:05,540
I would put it on because it's a big income source

8245
09:06:05,540 --> 09:06:07,540
and

8246
09:06:07,540 --> 09:06:09,540
I have terrible news I spent a lot of money

8247
09:06:09,540 --> 09:06:11,540
I just

8248
09:06:11,540 --> 09:06:13,540
yeah

8249
09:06:13,540 --> 09:06:15,540
feeler wasn't cheap let's put it that way

8250
09:06:17,540 --> 09:06:19,540
yes not even fallout in New Vegas

8251
09:06:21,540 --> 09:06:23,540
what about fallout in New Vegas

8252
09:06:23,540 --> 09:06:25,540
I've seen

8253
09:06:25,540 --> 09:06:27,540
399 and 799

8254
09:06:27,540 --> 09:06:29,540
that's rubbish that's not nice

8255
09:06:29,540 --> 09:06:31,540
if they use it they have to turn on being

8256
09:06:31,540 --> 09:06:33,540
oh they have to turn on being able to receive gifts as well

8257
09:06:33,540 --> 09:06:35,540
okay okay well that's

8258
09:06:35,540 --> 09:06:37,540
a team effort

8259
09:06:37,540 --> 09:06:39,540
just a wee bit of money

8260
09:06:39,540 --> 09:06:41,540
just a wee bit of pocket money

8261
09:06:41,540 --> 09:06:43,540
that's a lot

8262
09:06:43,540 --> 09:06:45,540
right

8263
09:06:45,540 --> 09:06:47,540

8264
09:06:47,540 --> 09:06:49,540
