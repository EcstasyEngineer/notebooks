02:30.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

03:00.000 --> 03:01.820
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

03:01.820 --> 03:02.720
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

03:02.720 --> 03:05.640
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

03:05.640 --> 03:08.220
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

03:08.220 --> 03:16.400
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little of

03:16.400 --> 03:21.400
I feel like I'm moving five miles an hour.

03:21.400 --> 03:26.400
I'm so tired.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.400
How are you?

03:29.400 --> 03:31.400
I'm not...

03:31.400 --> 03:35.400
I'm not gonna lie to you.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.400
At exactly four o'clock, I woke up from a nap,

03:39.400 --> 03:41.400
walked over to my computer,

03:41.400 --> 03:45.400
and pressed go live.

03:45.400 --> 03:49.400
So I'm still waking up.

03:49.400 --> 03:57.400
I'm waking up to ash and dust.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
Okay.

03:58.400 --> 04:05.400
Might be a little bit delirious.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
Got my tea.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.400
Ready to rumble.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.400
I gotta remember who I am.

04:13.400 --> 04:19.400
I also got an iPad stand.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.400
Thank you for your support,

04:21.400 --> 04:23.400
those who look at my throne and such.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.400
And I was trying to set it up

04:25.400 --> 04:27.400
so that I could use my iPad

04:27.400 --> 04:29.400
almost like a third monitor and look at chat.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.400
And it was working well,

04:31.400 --> 04:34.400
except I could see it was so tiny

04:34.400 --> 04:36.400
that I couldn't see anything.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.400
And I'm like, oh, I'll have to lean forward

04:38.400 --> 04:42.400
and squint my eyes to see what the frick I'm looking at.

04:42.400 --> 04:47.400
Ugh.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.400
What are you guys doing today?

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
How was...

04:50.400 --> 04:52.400
Did you get double ASMR again

04:52.400 --> 05:01.400
from Shtrone and Anise?

05:01.400 --> 05:02.400
By the way,

05:02.400 --> 05:10.400
is she be short for Shabilla?

05:10.400 --> 05:16.400
I'm too tired to come up with a snarky remark to that.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.400
Oh, no, I see the Tomb Raider.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.400
I don't know where I am.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
I've got two milk model kids.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.400
Go.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.400
Sick, but you're here.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.400
I like...

05:28.400 --> 05:30.400
Some of you guys might have saw me

05:30.400 --> 05:33.400
I went to the doctors this morning

05:33.400 --> 05:40.400
and like going out into the world

05:40.400 --> 05:43.400
takes a lot out of me and interacting with people

05:43.400 --> 05:45.400
because I kept getting turned around.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.400
Like I kept accidentally going the wrong way

05:47.400 --> 05:49.400
because my GPS was messing stuff up.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.400
I was a little bit late

05:51.400 --> 05:53.400
and then the office was taken forever.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.400
And so I was just so tired

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
when I got home,

05:56.400 --> 05:58.400
but then I had to do a bunch of other stuff

05:58.400 --> 05:59.400
to prepare for stream.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.400
And then like exactly 3.30,

06:01.400 --> 06:03.400
I just fell asleep on the couch

06:03.400 --> 06:07.400
and knocked out.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.400
But we're here.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.400
We are here.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.400
She be being lost is kind of me.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.400
I have no sense of direction.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.400
I never know where I am.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.400
Even in my town,

06:24.400 --> 06:26.400
in my city that I've lived in

06:26.400 --> 06:29.400
for my entire life, essentially,

06:29.400 --> 06:33.400
I'm like, oh, which road do I take?

06:33.400 --> 06:38.400
Where am I?

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400
It's not a miracle I'm awake right now.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
I did set an alarm,

06:42.400 --> 06:43.400
but I'm like,

06:43.400 --> 06:45.400
I know I needed to just like lay down for a bit

06:45.400 --> 06:48.400
and just gain my bearings.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.400
But I hope you guys enjoyed Tomb Raider

06:51.400 --> 06:56.400
with Icy and then ASMR with Momay.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.400
I am quite eepy.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.400
I am waking up.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.400
Don't worry, I'll wake up though.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.400
I'm just like here.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.400
I didn't fall asleep till like 3 a.m.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
My whole sleep schedule is messed up

07:09.400 --> 07:13.400
ever since I streamed so late.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
Oh, a womb raider?

07:15.400 --> 07:17.400
Oh my God.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.400
I already made that joke.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.400
I made the Ash and Dust joke.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.400
The Imagine Dragons.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.400
Oh, you like Imagine Dragons?

07:27.400 --> 07:29.400
Well, imagine me dragging these nuts

07:29.400 --> 07:31.400
across your face.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.400
Got him.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.400
I forget to put my ooloo mouth on.

07:37.400 --> 07:43.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.400
I'm pretty good.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.400
I'm pretty, I'm pretty, I'm pretty, uh,

07:48.400 --> 07:51.400
I'm as, I'm as smart as a whip

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
that doesn't make any sense.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.400
But yeah, I have no idea what this game is about.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.400
Um, I know like it might be a visual novel.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.400
I went in for like a second

08:02.400 --> 08:04.400
and I saw that it was voice acted.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
So I turned off the voices.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.400
I'll be voice at voicing.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
See the characters today.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.400
And you guys can vote in the voices.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.400
It's about bunny girls.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.400
Yeah.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.400
Like I haven't watched any gameplay.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.400
Haven't read anything about it.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.400
I know it was a flavor of the month game

08:24.400 --> 08:26.400
for a very, for a little bit.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
I'm like, okay, I'll play it.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
Um, so we'll see.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
We'll see.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.400
Yawns and finds.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.400
I'm surrounded by bunny girls.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.400
I see this as an absolute win.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.400
Okay.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.400
I'm going to love it.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400
I also went in just in case

08:42.400 --> 08:45.400
because like when I went to purchase the game

08:45.400 --> 08:48.400
I was like, oh wait, I hope there's not like surprise

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
things that need to be censored.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
So I went in and I double checked

08:52.400 --> 08:54.400
because I didn't know if it was going to be like a Hoonipop situation.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.400
You guys are all just like tricking me

08:57.400 --> 08:59.400
and the whole world is against me tricking me.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.400
Pretending that stuff is normal.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.400
And then it's a crazy messed up game.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.400
Um, yeah.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
So I went in.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.400
There wasn't any of that.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.400
I was like, okay.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.400
Although I did see like when I was looking at the steam page

09:17.400 --> 09:20.400
for like a brief second when I was purchasing the game

09:20.400 --> 09:23.400
just like people's screenshots

09:23.400 --> 09:26.400
and they're all Ponzu shots.

09:26.400 --> 09:31.400
So I'm like, what am I getting into?

09:31.400 --> 09:33.400
Whoo.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.400
Kushi jokes scare.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.400
Exactly.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.400
She doesn't know about the level that just opens.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.400
What?

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
Excuse me.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.400
It's just a lot of fan service.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
It's on brand for me.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.400
What color today?

09:51.400 --> 09:53.400
What the fuck does that mean?

09:53.400 --> 09:55.400
I'm white.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.400
I did tease a possible brown toggle.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.400
It's death less messed up than class of 09.

10:07.400 --> 10:12.400
I didn't expect it to be messed up as much as class of 09.

10:12.400 --> 10:18.400
Panty simulator with a side of alcohol.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.400
You think they meant my ponzu?

10:22.400 --> 10:24.400
I don't even remember.

10:24.400 --> 10:28.400
Um, actually these are one of my favorite pairs.

10:28.400 --> 10:36.400
It's like pastel rainbow-y lace with flowers on it.

10:36.400 --> 10:44.400
And it's a thong.

10:44.400 --> 10:47.400
And it's like has a lot of light blue.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.400
It's nice to get my skin tone.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.400
Anyways, usually we're nothing,

10:53.400 --> 10:55.400
but I had to go out into the world today.

10:55.400 --> 11:00.400
So I decided to, you know, bundle up before going on an excursion.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.400
I actually fucking hate thongs.

11:04.400 --> 11:08.400
I don't even know why I have so many, so many, so many.

11:08.400 --> 11:15.400
I need to buy more underwear, like some like cheekies.

11:15.400 --> 11:22.400
I accidentally, so like I, I'm a huge fan of like the Savage X Fenty,

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
like Rihanna's lingerie line.

11:24.400 --> 11:32.400
And I forgot to fucking cancel my membership because they charge $59 a month for membership.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.400
And you can skip the month, mind you.

11:35.400 --> 11:40.400
And you can like save the money, but I swear to you, I thought I skipped the month.

11:40.400 --> 11:44.400
And they charge me 60 bucks and I have to spend it on something.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.400
And I'm like, well, it looks like I'm getting panties.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
Looks like I'm getting panties.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.400
They have great stuff, but I'm like, what the hell?

11:52.400 --> 11:57.400
You know, I'm like, what the, what the actual fuck?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.400
It's really high quality.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.400
It's mostly what I wear.

12:00.400 --> 12:07.400
Although I go to the pink store sometimes for a little something, something.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.400
It's been 10 minutes and we're talking about pansos.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.400
Yeah.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.400
What did you expect?

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
Are you new here?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.400
Wait a minute.

12:15.400 --> 12:20.400
Who are you?

12:20.400 --> 12:23.400
What does she be?

12:23.400 --> 12:24.400
It's funny.

12:24.400 --> 12:32.400
You guys have got me saying, erm, what the sigma and erm, what the scallop?

12:32.400 --> 12:41.400
I, cause like when I, when my stream just wasn't loading, when I pressed start, I was like, erm,

12:41.400 --> 12:43.400
what the, what the scallop?

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
Scallop.

12:44.400 --> 12:50.400
And then I just like, audibly sighed out loud when I, when I heard what I said.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.400
I'd be disappointed if people weren't still talking about random, at this point.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
Random what?

12:56.400 --> 13:00.400
You be, it's she be, it's me, it's she be.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.400
Let's go and, yep.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.400
I should put disclaimer.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
I'm tired of shit.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.400
I promise you I'm not drunk.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.400
I'm just tired.

13:12.400 --> 13:20.400
Usually like, listen, I made a big sacrifice streaming at the time that I do because around

13:20.400 --> 13:24.400
this time is normally my nap time.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.400
My family is notorious for napping.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
My mom's the only one that can't.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.400
My whole dad's side of the family are napping champions.

13:32.400 --> 13:42.400
And from four to five, 30 prime nap time, something, I've like napped for like four hours before

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
and I still managed to get to sleep.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.400
Is it depression?

13:46.400 --> 13:47.400
I don't know.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.400
Maybe she's born with it.

13:48.400 --> 13:54.400
Maybe it's dysthymia.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.400
She be, did you hear a Twitter room of the likes you can see?

13:57.400 --> 14:02.400
I can still see everybody's likes because I have not updated my Twitter on my phone.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.400
So you can't hide from me.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.400
I know your secrets.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.400
I know when you're awake.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
I know when you've been bad or good.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.400
So be bad.

14:12.400 --> 14:20.400
For goodness sake.

14:20.400 --> 14:25.400
What is your favorite kind of vegetable?

14:26.400 --> 14:28.400
Is a potato a vegetable?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
I really like potatoes.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.400
Yeah, potatoes are vegetable.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.400
Yeah, because it doesn't have like a seed.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.400
I was like the dumbest thing I've ever said.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.400
Is a potato a vegetable?

14:41.400 --> 14:44.400
Oh my God.

14:44.400 --> 14:49.400
It's funny because like technically zucchini is fruit.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.400
Tomatoes are fruit.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.400
Carrots are vegetable and like leafy greens are vegetables.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.400
I really like all vegetables.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.400
I'm like trying to think of a vegetable I don't like.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.400
Like because I'll just eat anything.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.400
I don't like, like, I like, I'm not a huge fan of arugula but I also eat it.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.400
I really like spinach.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.400
Yep.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.400
I like Brussels sprouts.

15:15.400 --> 15:20.400
Did you know they've actually engineered the bad flavor out of Brussels sprouts now?

15:20.400 --> 15:22.400
My dad used to hate Brussels sprouts.

15:22.400 --> 15:28.400
And then he like threw some in the air fryer and like with a little bit of oil, salt and pepper.

15:28.400 --> 15:32.400
And they were like really tasty, nutty, almost like an artichoke heart.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.400
And he's like, this is not like what they taste like back then.

15:35.400 --> 15:39.400
And then we looked it up and did research and they actually engineered the shit out of there.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
You hate bell peppers?

15:40.400 --> 15:43.400
I love bell peppers.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.400
Tomatoes are both vegetables and fruit.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.400
Depends on which taxonomy you're using.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.400
All right.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.400
I don't know what that means, but Godspeed.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.400
Listen, it smells so strong.

15:53.400 --> 15:59.400
Yeah, they do still smell like, you know, the devil's asshole, but it is.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.400
Spinach over lettuce for sale.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.400
It's 100%.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.400
I like butter lettuce because it's similar to spinach.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.400
Or I'll use like butter lettuce for like a lettuce wrap.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.400
Pretty good.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.400
Why the fuck are we talking about vegetables?

16:13.400 --> 16:16.400
You know how much, like, this is how, this is what I mean.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.400
Somebody asked me a question.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.400
I'm like, all right.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.400
Talks 10 minutes explaining my answers.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.400
But her lettuce, I barely know.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.400
Shut up.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.400
Get out of here.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.400
I think canned steamed veggies turn people off.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
Flavors are much better.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.400
Baked in oil.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
Oh yeah, I agree with that.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.400
I prefer, I'll eat steamed veggies because I like, I like steamed broccoli.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.400
You're green beans.

16:46.400 --> 16:51.400
I love green beans.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.400
The best lounge chat.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.400
Yeah.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.400
Yeah, but be cotton bum.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.400
That's a me.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.400
Favorite breakfast.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.400
You know, I love French toast.

17:03.400 --> 17:11.400
French toast, I think was the first thing I learned how to cook after like learning how to like boil water and like make eggs.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.400
I learned how to make French toast.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.400
My mom taught me how to make French toast.

17:15.400 --> 17:20.400
And it was so fun, that experience.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.400
I burned everything, but you know, you live and you learn.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
But yeah, I love, I love French toast.

17:25.400 --> 17:31.400
I love the French toast, especially if it's Texas toast.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.400
I don't know.

17:33.400 --> 17:43.400
I'm speaking in a very poor French accent because I'm half asleep, but I am.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.400
It is how it is.

17:45.400 --> 17:50.400
No, I didn't, I can boil water.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.400
Guys, I'm a very good cook.

17:53.400 --> 17:59.400
When you're a kid and you're learning, you're not a very good cook.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.400
It's called eggy bread in England.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.400
That's fucking weird.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.400
It's not a better name.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.400
No, I don't like it.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.400
Don't ask to doubt.

18:09.400 --> 18:20.400
If you've looked at my all account, people have commended me on my cooking skills because I've sent, I've taken pictures and posted some food I have cooked.

18:20.400 --> 18:25.400
French toast is called lost bread and friend.

18:25.400 --> 18:30.400
I feel like there's a pun in there.

18:30.400 --> 18:35.400
I just found out the healthy frozen protein waffles taste and smell like the Ben and Jerry's waffle cones.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.400
Oh, okay.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.400
But what brand?

18:39.400 --> 18:40.400
I do love waffles though.

18:40.400 --> 18:47.400
I used to fucking live off of, um, my mom said I used to love French toast sticks and ego waffles.

18:47.400 --> 18:54.400
And then out of nostalgia the other day, I bought some ego waffles, but I don't have any syrup or butter.

18:54.400 --> 18:59.400
So mistakes were made.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.400
Waffles versus pancakes.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.400
I prefer waffles.

19:02.400 --> 19:07.400
Like I love, I really like pancakes, but like sometimes pancakes would be a bit too mushy for me.

19:07.400 --> 19:15.400
And I like the, I prefer the texture of a waffle over a pancake and that like a waffle can hold syrup better.

19:15.400 --> 19:22.400
Whereas a pancake, um, just becomes kind of just like soppy.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
I've read French toast sticks.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
It's pretty much just like French toast.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.400
And you throw it in a toaster and you toast it in there.

19:29.400 --> 19:36.400
Or like a confectionary confection oven or an oven.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.400
My Belgian side tell me waffles.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.400
Raw talking echoes.

19:41.400 --> 19:49.400
I have done that before, but I prefer like I, I, I'm weird and I prefer to eat waffles with my hands.

19:49.400 --> 19:57.400
Like my mom, uh, for some odd reason, because it's not like I was going to impress anybody or have a luncheon with the queen.

19:57.400 --> 20:04.400
But she drilled etiquette in like proper, like using silverware into me.

20:04.400 --> 20:12.400
Um, like which forks and knives to use, which like if you're at this sort of event, what this means and what that means.

20:12.400 --> 20:18.400
Um, I think she just wanted me to be like proper, which isn't like a bad thing.

20:18.400 --> 20:23.400
Like teaching me, you know, your child etiquette and being, you know, behaved at the dinner table.

20:23.400 --> 20:31.400
Cause I was like, I remember, um, I would always have to say, like, can I be excused before I left the dinner table?

20:31.400 --> 20:34.400
And I had, you know, all that stuff.

20:34.400 --> 20:39.400
And so I remember like one parent when I was over somebody's house, I would just like, can I be excused?

20:39.400 --> 20:41.400
And they're like, why are you asking?

20:41.400 --> 20:44.400
And I'm like, cause I always have to ask.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.400
Yeah.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.400
Yeah.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.400
Manors maketh.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
She beat.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
It's funny.

20:49.400 --> 20:53.400
I was literally, I don't know why it popped in my head on the toilet, but I was randomly just sitting there.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.400
I'm just like, manners maketh the man.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.400
I didn't even watch Kingsman reach recently.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.400
Actually, that's a lie.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.400
I watched the Kingsman.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.400
I didn't finish it because it was boring.

21:05.400 --> 21:09.400
I got to the part past Rasputin.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.400
Rasputin.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
Poutine.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.400
Rasputin now.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.400
And I was like, all right, this is kind of weird.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.400
And it's kind of boring.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.400
I prefer the first Kingsman movies moving on.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.400
And then I fell asleep.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.400
And then I just never bothered to watch it again.

21:25.400 --> 21:30.400
She'd be getting mad at her friend's house because they served over the wrong shoulder.

21:30.400 --> 21:33.400
No, like, I don't even recall like a lot of that stuff anymore.

21:33.400 --> 21:38.400
I remember I went to like a fancy restaurant with my parents.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.400
And this is the type of restaurant where if you get crumbs on the table,

21:41.400 --> 21:49.400
they come over and they have a little thing to take the crumbs off and they move them away.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.400
And they have like the multiple silverware.

21:51.400 --> 21:57.400
And it's like, that's like, my parents usually go there for their anniversary because it's a very like pricey place.

21:57.400 --> 22:03.400
And I've been like sitting there and I'm like, fuck, which fork do I use for salad again?

22:03.400 --> 22:07.400
I don't even, my mom's like that one.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.400
And I'm like, oh, thanks.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
Anyways.

22:09.400 --> 22:33.400
I love doing that and just dance.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.400
It's like probably my favorite song to do in just dance.

22:35.400 --> 22:40.400
Besides, I think was I like that by Richard.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.400
Hold on.

22:41.400 --> 22:56.400
I like that just dance by the talk by the elect.

22:56.400 --> 23:04.400
Was it the toxic revenge or what the fuck toxic Avenger?

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
Am I tripping?

23:05.400 --> 23:21.400
I could have sworn I like that by toxic Avenger was in just dance.

23:21.400 --> 23:33.400
I'm getting as toxic from Britney Spears.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.400
I'm very frustrated.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.400
Whatever.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.400
I'm experiencing a Mandela effect for a moment.

23:39.400 --> 23:43.400
It's going to beat Saber.

23:43.400 --> 23:48.400
I definitely want to like if when they get a 3D model, 100% want to do just dance.

23:48.400 --> 23:53.400
I'm like, I need to get back into like dance and shape.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.400
I'm just like a miss.

23:55.400 --> 24:00.400
I'm just atrophying in my chair.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.400
I think you had a cool dream.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.400
Toxic Avenger is a movie.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.400
No.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.400
I think your thumbnail got restricted.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.400
Are you fucking serious?

24:08.400 --> 24:15.400
You know, I noticed that when I was on my iPad, I was just like, wait a second.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.400
Why is it like grayed out?

24:17.400 --> 24:21.400
Like, was that like the three dots thing?

24:21.400 --> 24:27.400
I didn't know what that meant, though, but that makes a lot more sense then.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.400
I'll fix it later.

24:28.400 --> 24:32.400
I blame my manager.

24:32.400 --> 24:36.400
They approve the thumbnail.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.400
Throw some boobs in the thumbnail.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.400
Put some boobs in the thumbnail, bitch.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
Put some boobs.

24:42.400 --> 24:47.400
Check out Azura's cover of boobs in the thumbnail.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.400
I thought it was lag.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.400
I thought the gray was an artistic choice.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.400
It's gray in the homepage.

24:55.400 --> 25:14.400
Just more reminders that I'm probably never going to be monetized.

25:14.400 --> 25:23.400
Sometimes I fall asleep and I hear my BGM in my ears.

25:23.400 --> 25:32.400
I can't tell if I like it or not.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.400
Wake up.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.400
I need a non-outfit.

25:36.400 --> 25:43.400
I was thinking about adding one of those to throw in one of those VTuber outfits that

25:43.400 --> 25:47.400
I've been using for streams and stuff.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.400
I have to get rid of this VOD based on what happened with other streamers.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.400
Why?

25:51.400 --> 25:54.400
What happened to their VODs?

25:54.400 --> 25:58.400
Wait, I thought everyone got monetized and said, no, that's not true.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.400
We applied for monetization all at the same time.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.400
The majority of the other girls got it.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.400
I'm still under review.

26:07.400 --> 26:15.400
I'm mentally preparing myself to be disappointed in case it happens.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.400
Serenity!

26:16.400 --> 26:20.400
Manchibi would go so hard.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.400
Does she know?

26:22.400 --> 26:24.400
Do they know?

26:24.400 --> 26:29.400
There was a priestess and a nun and another iteration.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.400
Sorry, don't you usually stream around this time?

26:32.400 --> 26:36.400
What are you doing, girl?

26:36.400 --> 26:43.400
Serenity, I made you an call of the lamb and you tried to kill me.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.400
What was it?

26:44.400 --> 26:48.400
You tried spreading falsehoods about my cult, so I had to throw you in prison.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.400
So you're currently in prison right now and call of the lamb.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.400
I'm so sorry.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.400
VOD before streaming even started.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.400
What do you mean?

26:57.400 --> 26:59.400
YouTube said no to bunny garden?

26:59.400 --> 27:02.400
Explain.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.400
Is there anything you can do?

27:03.400 --> 27:08.400
I can reapply in a month.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.400
That's where I belong in prison.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.400
I'm getting lazy.

27:13.400 --> 27:20.400
Yeah, it would just be a month of I'd have to reapply.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.400
Do I have a hat?

27:22.400 --> 27:24.400
No.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.400
What?

27:26.400 --> 27:27.400
What's that?

27:27.400 --> 27:28.400
A hat?

27:28.400 --> 27:30.400
A crazy, funky, junky hat?

27:30.400 --> 27:31.400
Ever slept?

27:31.400 --> 27:32.400
Hair and tidy?

27:32.400 --> 27:34.400
Oh, she looks like here at nightly.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.400
We've been there.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.400
We've done that.

27:36.400 --> 27:40.400
We see right through your funky hat.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.400
Do you know where that's from?

27:43.400 --> 27:46.400
I should be fine as long as you skip over the in-game ASMR.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.400
Really?

27:49.400 --> 27:52.400
Why don't I have a hat?

27:52.400 --> 27:53.400
Was that from Hannah Montana?

27:53.400 --> 27:55.400
Close.

27:55.400 --> 28:01.400
It's from another show around that time.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.400
Why did we go show ago?

28:04.400 --> 28:06.400
Does that mean you're definitely not going to get me?

28:06.400 --> 28:08.400
Guys, I have no idea.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.400
I have no idea.

28:09.400 --> 28:21.400
Maybe the YouTube coon will smile upon me and bless me with monetization.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.400
But who knows?

28:22.400 --> 28:24.400
If not, it is what it is.

28:24.400 --> 28:28.400
You can always support me on Patreon even if you don't want to consume the content.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.400
Or you can always support me through stream loads.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.400
Or you can check out my merch.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.400
It is not the end of the world.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.400
Wizards of Waverly Place, you got it!

28:40.400 --> 28:42.400
I need a do-in-your-mom hat.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.400
That's pretty good.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.400
That's pretty good.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.400
I would actually probably get that.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.400
Somebody said, uh,

28:50.400 --> 28:56.400
Man, I love fishing hat.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.400
I'm not worried about...

28:59.400 --> 29:01.400
She likes to yap just as much as me.

29:01.400 --> 29:04.400
Like mother like daughter.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.400
Donate my imaginary memory.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.400
I'd be like, alright.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.400
Pay your tithes every month.

29:11.400 --> 29:14.400
And just pretend your name is green.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.400
No member strips.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.400
Memberships.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.400
Membership streams though.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.400
Um, well, yeah, I'm not...

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
I'm not too worried.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.400
I'm kind of just like dooming about it.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.400
Just like mentally.

29:27.400 --> 29:33.400
Because you know, what is that thing that like Wednesday Adam says?

29:33.400 --> 29:37.400
If you expect the worst, you can't be disappointed or some shit.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.400
But like, yeah.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.400
Member strips.

29:40.400 --> 29:45.400
Member strips is where you get chicken strips sent to you once a month in the mail.

29:45.400 --> 29:49.400
And the box that they come in has my face stamped at them.

29:49.400 --> 29:55.400
But it's like, you know that one gif of like a chicken pole dancing?

29:55.400 --> 29:56.400
Or it's like a rabbit?

29:56.400 --> 29:57.400
I don't know.

29:57.400 --> 29:58.400
Just pretend it's a chicken.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.400
So it's a chicken pole dancing.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.400
And that's like the way my face is on the chicken.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.400
And then you get chicken strips from Sheebie.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.400
That's chicken member strips.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.400
Yep.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.400
They good.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.400
They're the best.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.400
Nothing.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.400
Nothing but the best for my baby girls.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.400
Thank you.

30:17.400 --> 30:22.400
Thank you, Harilit.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.400
Full de tans.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.400
Full de tans.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.400
Full de tans.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.400
Thank you.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.400
It didn't pop up because I had muted my desktop audio.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.400
I forgot to turn it back on.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.400
But thank you, Harilit.

30:34.400 --> 30:39.400
But don't, yeah, don't worry about me.

30:39.400 --> 30:44.400
It's mostly frustrating because I had like, I want to do like the membership streams that

30:44.400 --> 30:47.400
I have in mind.

30:47.400 --> 30:50.400
My face, no, my face isn't on the strips.

30:50.400 --> 30:58.400
It's on the box that holds the strips, unless you would prefer both.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.400
We might do that.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.400
Ow.

31:02.400 --> 31:07.400
I just like hit myself with a nipple really hard.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.400
Excuse me.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.400
That was a sleepy burp.

31:11.400 --> 31:15.400
All right.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.400
Go, ABGM.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.400
It's time to play.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
Bup, bup, bup, bup.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
Body Gordon.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.400
Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.

31:25.400 --> 31:33.400
Where the fuck is it?

31:33.400 --> 31:36.400
Can I kiss the boo boo to help?

31:36.400 --> 31:47.400
You know, can I be, can I be, can I be TMI for a second?

31:47.400 --> 31:49.400
So mine are pierced.

31:49.400 --> 31:53.400
And so sometimes I just get like hooked on stuff.

31:53.400 --> 31:58.400
Or I'm just like bump into something.

31:58.400 --> 32:07.400
And that's like the worst thing.

32:07.400 --> 32:09.400
I don't know.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.400
No, no, I'm not ripping them.

32:11.400 --> 32:18.400
They're not, my nipples aren't getting ripped off guys.

32:18.400 --> 32:33.400
It's more, it's like imagine, like, if it, like, you know, I don't know if it's like this at all because I don't have balls, but imagine you're going to zip up your pants and like a little bit of your ball gets like caught in the zipper.

32:33.400 --> 32:37.400
It's like a little bit, it's like a little less than that.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.400
That's what I'm assuming.

32:39.400 --> 32:46.400
But imagine that on your chest.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.400
It was like, you know, like, I'm not going to elaborate.

32:49.400 --> 33:00.400
Anyways, I was just fucking loud.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.400
I've had it before it hurts.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.400
Ouch.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.400
You get in the hospital when you get caught in your zipper.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.400
Well, I mean, I didn't mean like if you're caught caught, like you can't get out.

33:09.400 --> 33:13.400
I mean, like, when you kind of zip it up and just like pinches you a little bit.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.400
Like, because I'm like, I've done that.

33:14.400 --> 33:20.400
I've done that to my pussy lip before and I was like, I'm just like, like, girl.

33:20.400 --> 33:24.400
And then I'm just like, quickly.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.400
Okay, maybe it's not as bad as that.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.400
That's unimaginable.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.400
You guys are such fucking babies.

33:31.400 --> 33:35.400
You nipple piercings hurt once they're there.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.400
For the first like couple months.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.400
Yes, they're pretty tender.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.400
I remember I went so I went with Salem, who I talk about often.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.400
She we had only known each other for a week.

33:45.400 --> 33:49.400
Mind you, I'm like, hey, do you want to come with me and watch me get my nipples pierced?

33:49.400 --> 33:51.400
And she's just like, oh my God, yes, sure.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.400
Because I want to walk like I want to get them done too.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.400
And I'm like, okay, let's go.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.400
And we go there.

33:58.400 --> 34:03.400
First one goes in and I'm like, ow, that really hurt.

34:03.400 --> 34:08.400
And I look over and look at Salem's face and her face is like completely mortified.

34:09.400 --> 34:20.400
And then the piercer was telling me so usually the adrenaline kicks in only for the first one and then kind of tapers off for the second one.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.400
So a lot of people don't get the second one done.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.400
I'm like, fuck it.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.400
Put the second one through.

34:24.400 --> 34:27.400
And they did that and it hurt worse.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.400
And I was like, ah.

34:29.400 --> 34:35.400
And then I couldn't like put anything against my chest for like a month.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.400
I went right back to work.

34:39.400 --> 34:43.400
Because there was a piercing place in the mall and I just went back to work.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.400
I went on my lunch break.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.400
I'm like, fuck it.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.400
I'm a badass bitch.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
I just have barbells.

34:57.400 --> 35:00.400
But they look cute in a shirt and stuff.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.400
I know some people don't like them.

35:03.400 --> 35:09.400
But like, I know Strawny's model has them.

35:09.400 --> 35:13.400
My model doesn't have it though.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.400
But it would be on brand for me to have it.

35:16.400 --> 35:20.400
But like, I have a high pain tolerance.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.400
Strawny's model.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.400
Don't worry about it.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.400
Hi, mom.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.400
Hi, mom.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.400
Did mom read?

35:26.400 --> 35:28.400
Did you hi?

35:28.400 --> 35:29.400
Hello.

35:29.400 --> 35:33.400
Hey, I'm just presuming off of your alt account.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.400
Hey, listen.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.400
They probably watched like 30 minutes.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.400
So I was normal for the first about 30 minutes and now we're not normal.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.400
I didn't read you, but you should have read it.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.400
Can you guys hear Raina singing the song of her people in the background?

35:59.400 --> 36:02.400
She be, Strawny is she be Donnie Dami mommy?

36:02.400 --> 36:03.400
No.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.400
She might be my mother.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.400
She doesn't Dami though.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.400
Normal.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.400
What about?

36:20.400 --> 36:22.400
I already forgot what I was talking about.

36:23.400 --> 36:26.400
But um, yeah, I have a high pain tolerance.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.400
So she doesn't hurt me.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.400
Not sorry.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.400
She was a doll.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.400
It's too soft.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.400
She's I am also dollar.

36:35.400 --> 36:36.400
Yeah.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.400
I'm.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.400
Am I the tallest girl?

36:40.400 --> 36:41.400
Or is there?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.400
I might be the tallest girl.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.400
No.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.400
It's a tallest girl.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.400
Am I the tallest girl out of all?

36:46.400 --> 36:48.400
I can't remember.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.400
Strawny is a freaking small ass chick.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.400
Let me tell you that though.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.400
I could probably rest my arm on her head.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.400
Why did I choose this game?

37:04.400 --> 37:06.400
Because I had the word bunny in it.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.400
And I wanted to play something bunny related.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.400
I'll take a seat.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.400
Well, no, I meant like like actual heights.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.400
Like I meant like RTX model heights.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.400
Out of normal heights.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.400
Yes.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.400
Is there is the tallest because she could fucking turn into a sky scraper.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.400
I'm just six feet in heels.

37:26.400 --> 37:31.400
I'm normally like five, six in my little.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.400
Wait, am I five, six in heels?

37:33.400 --> 37:34.400
Does that mean I'm.

37:35.400 --> 37:41.400
I'm just thinking because if I'm 168 centimeters while I'm wearing my red heels.

37:41.400 --> 37:47.400
Does that mean I'm actually like five, four whole is my life a lie?

37:50.400 --> 37:51.400
Holy.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.400
You're the tallest girl since there are cheats because he's a giant.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.400
That's true.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.400
She just like stays tall.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.400
I'm getting bullied for my height.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.400
I could sell.

38:05.400 --> 38:08.400
Because normally because normally I'm like I'm five, eight, five, nine.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.400
But.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.400
2D she be is five, six.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.400
But I don't know if that's with heels or without heels.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.400
So.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.400
Design Papa.

38:23.400 --> 38:29.400
I'm going to need you to get on that and give me my canonical canon con height.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.400
Yep.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.400
Words.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.400
English exists.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.400
Absolute.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.400
Absolute short stack.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.400
I'm not.

38:43.400 --> 38:48.400
I'm taller than the majority of people I interact with on a daily basis.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
Yes, it's mostly my cats.

38:50.400 --> 38:54.400
But when I go back to work, I am literally taller than so many fucking people.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.400
She be who is the ebony of this game?

38:58.400 --> 39:00.400
You know, the Draco living golf.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.400
Who cuts because I don't know.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.400
I don't know.

39:03.400 --> 39:10.400
Maybe the girl with the black hair who kind of looks like that one chick from device.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.400
Halo device.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.400
That sounds so bad.

39:19.400 --> 39:23.400
I just, I just literally noticed right now that she kind of like looks like the girl from device.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.400
Hello from honey pop.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.400
Hey, quick question.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.400
Why is your thumbnail gray?

39:29.400 --> 39:31.400
I think my thumbnail was nuked.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.400
Yeah.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.400
Yeah.

39:37.400 --> 39:38.400
So.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.400
Hey, scrawny, can you tell?

39:41.400 --> 39:48.400
Uh, manager to make me another thumbnail with a cover up so I can put that up instead.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.400
Because it got yanked.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.400
Thank you, mom.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
I love you, mom.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.400
You're the best, mom.

39:55.400 --> 39:58.400
Are you firing peeler allegation?

39:58.400 --> 39:59.400
Please do not make it.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.400
Cock color.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.400
Yeah, my thumbnail guy.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.400
Yep.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.400
Zippity-doodle.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.400
Zippity-dade.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.400
It wasn't even bad.

40:08.400 --> 40:15.400
It was literally me standing almost like I was in a fucking t-pose because I did an emote for my face for the thumbnail.

40:15.400 --> 40:18.400
So I'm just kind of just like standing there.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.400
It was literally that I will show you what it was.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.400
Hold on.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.400
It was literally me going like this.

40:27.400 --> 40:28.400
No, not even with that.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.400
Just like.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.400
That's why I got it nuked.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.400
My thumbnails might all get yanked.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.400
I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.

40:40.400 --> 40:46.400
I guess I just have to become flat, you know, because flat's justice and all.

40:46.400 --> 40:49.400
Looks deviously at mother.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.400
Maybe I just have to become cute and funny.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.400
Looks deviously at mother.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.400
It shows up in some fever blinds.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.400
Yeah, I noticed that.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.400
I'd be too powerful with that.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.400
You're right, you're right.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.400
Do they know?

41:12.400 --> 41:14.400
They're gonna know.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.400
They're not gonna know.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.400
I'm already cute and funny.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.400
You know what is awesome?

41:24.400 --> 41:30.400
So I ordered some stuff from Amazon for my ASMR this week.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.400
What's today?

41:32.400 --> 41:35.400
Wednesday to March, Thursday, Power Wash collab.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.400
I don't remember what day my own ASMR stream is.

41:38.400 --> 41:45.400
But I got like Pop Rocks for a really cool trigger.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.400
And they taste really good too.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
I already had like one pack.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.400
Well, I'm finishing it up right now.

41:57.400 --> 41:59.400
I don't know.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.400
And those will get nuked for mouth sounds.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.400
I don't know if, Johnny, did you already do this?

42:06.400 --> 42:08.400
Tell me in the news.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.400
Did you already do Pop Rocks?

42:13.400 --> 42:15.400
I feel like you did.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.400
Yeah, I feel like it's really nice.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.400
She did it with her feet sweat.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.400
Oh, I didn't know that part.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.400
Yeah, I ordered it a couple days ago.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.400
They finally came in.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.400
Thank you, mother.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.400
What the fuck is this?

42:44.400 --> 42:45.400
Oh my God.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.400
Why are you so fucking precious?

42:47.400 --> 42:49.400
I can't.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.400
Major, is it around?

42:53.400 --> 42:55.400
Here you go.

42:55.400 --> 42:58.400
A file name.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.400
Oh my, let me fix that.

43:02.400 --> 43:08.400
And it's just a fucking screenshot of me being live right now.

43:08.400 --> 43:10.400
Oh, I can't.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.400
You're too good for this earth.

43:12.400 --> 43:15.400
Oh my God, let me just.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.400
I'm keeping this thumbnail.

43:17.400 --> 43:20.400
I'm just straight keeping it.

43:20.400 --> 43:26.400
Even if they come back around to fix it.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.400
I'm just, I'm keeping this one up.

43:34.400 --> 43:38.400
Graphic design is my passion.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.400
It's Strani's passion, I should say.

43:49.400 --> 43:52.400
I can picture, I can picture your silly little face.

43:52.400 --> 43:55.400
Go he, he, he, he, in Scottish just.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.400
Hope you got, can you guys see it?

44:04.400 --> 44:05.400
Your work.

44:05.400 --> 44:06.400
Can you guys see it?

44:10.400 --> 44:14.400
Laffs in Scottish gasps in Spanish.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.400
Anyways games.

44:22.400 --> 44:26.280
Am I a dude?

44:26.280 --> 44:27.280
This loud?

44:27.280 --> 44:28.280
Holy fuck.

44:28.280 --> 44:37.160
That's a fucking loud.

44:37.160 --> 44:38.800
It's perfect.

44:38.800 --> 44:45.880
Or the thumbnail is perfect.

44:45.880 --> 44:48.760
Is the sound fine?

44:48.760 --> 44:53.080
Bye, strongy.

44:53.080 --> 45:14.080
Thank you for stopping by and making me an amazing thumbnail.

45:14.080 --> 45:25.080
Oh wait, can I go back?

45:25.080 --> 45:27.760
I got 15k again in my pocket.

45:27.760 --> 45:32.960
Isn't that like a hundred and fifty bucks or something?

45:32.960 --> 45:33.960
You know that face?

45:33.960 --> 45:40.760
Onion Makes and Spikes family that got me and that gives me, yes, exactly that one.

45:40.760 --> 45:48.760
Alright, I'm trying to think of a voice.

45:48.760 --> 45:51.840
My company fired me.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.840
It is what it is.

45:52.840 --> 45:55.560
It's not the first time it's happened.

45:55.560 --> 45:58.280
I'm thankful they hired me in the first place.

45:58.280 --> 46:01.480
I have nothing but gratitude for the company.

46:01.480 --> 46:04.040
My boss even cried for me when they fired me.

46:04.040 --> 46:07.160
He said, I'm sorry I couldn't help you out.

46:07.160 --> 46:11.360
They told me that this company isn't the right fit for me and that there are other places

46:11.360 --> 46:14.480
where I could shine.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.880
It was nice of them to say that.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.920
Is there really somewhere out there?

46:18.920 --> 46:22.680
Some place that would take in a fool like me?

46:22.680 --> 46:24.520
Haito-kun?

46:24.520 --> 46:28.160
Even if I could get another job somewhere else, I would just mess everything up for

46:28.160 --> 46:31.560
the people there.

46:31.560 --> 46:33.440
Ellipses.

46:33.440 --> 46:36.400
Maybe my life ellipses is done for.

46:36.400 --> 46:39.240
I didn't even think it has started.

46:39.240 --> 46:40.240
Ellipses.

46:40.240 --> 46:46.240
It's only been a minute in and I'm thinking about killing myself.

46:46.240 --> 46:50.640
Time to drink my problems.

46:50.640 --> 46:52.400
I guess he's the goth one.

46:52.400 --> 46:53.400
He's ebony.

46:53.400 --> 47:04.200
I'm pretty sure there's a barb somewhere in this building.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.200
Oh, is she 3D?

47:07.200 --> 47:10.200
Holy shit.

47:10.200 --> 47:19.200
You just feel so cool in my mouth.

47:19.200 --> 47:27.200
What sort of voice should we she have?

47:27.200 --> 47:40.200
We're eating pop rocks.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.200
Childhood friend voice?

47:42.200 --> 47:43.200
Givers?

47:43.200 --> 47:48.200
Okay, I'm just gonna put it to a poll.

47:48.200 --> 47:52.200
I like how you call it like an Emmy voice when you just want me to do a lulley voice.

47:52.200 --> 48:20.200
No, I guess just don't say that.

48:20.200 --> 48:23.200
Emmy sounds less gross.

48:23.200 --> 48:26.200
Connie voice.

48:26.200 --> 48:31.200
Give her a lisp.

48:31.200 --> 48:34.200
There's lollibabas.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.200
Hope by lollies.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.200
Aren't the girls voice in JP?

48:37.200 --> 48:40.200
Yeah, but I'm fucking doing the voices.

48:40.200 --> 48:44.200
Why would I?

48:44.200 --> 48:50.200
Any time I'm reading a visual novel, I'm the one doing the voices.

48:50.200 --> 48:57.200
My only excuse to do funny voices because the other times I do it when I'm just playing games, it doesn't make any fucking sense.

48:57.200 --> 49:00.200
Okay?

49:00.200 --> 49:04.200
That wasn't good.

49:04.200 --> 49:09.200
Cute and funny voice, Scottish, really condescending childhood friend.

49:09.200 --> 49:19.200
Or just wolf like a dog.

49:19.200 --> 49:24.200
I'll just do like deep voice.

49:24.200 --> 49:30.200
I don't know what that would be, but yeah.

49:31.200 --> 49:40.200
Have fun.

49:40.200 --> 49:47.200
We have three other, two other girls to voice.

49:47.200 --> 49:50.200
Six out of, yeah, no, Toma knows I can do better.

49:50.200 --> 49:55.200
Speaking of which, me and Toma have a collab coming up next week.

49:55.200 --> 50:02.200
Do little Pokemon smash her face.

50:02.200 --> 50:06.200
She is bringing out one of her characters, Trinket.

50:06.200 --> 50:12.200
I'm very excited.

50:12.200 --> 50:17.200
It'll be so good.

50:17.200 --> 50:24.200
That's my cat.

50:25.200 --> 50:31.200
She's going to say smash a low-punny.

50:31.200 --> 50:34.200
Literally someone mentioned this a couple of streams ago.

50:34.200 --> 50:38.200
I literally was just like, oh, I would do horrible things so low-punny.

50:38.200 --> 50:43.200
I literally said that.

50:43.200 --> 50:45.200
Was that the mom I have a toy?

50:45.200 --> 50:47.200
Yeah, she has her fluffy ball.

50:47.200 --> 50:49.200
She likes to take it into the bathroom.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.200
She likes to scream in the bathtub.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.200
Don't ask me why she does that.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.200
I call it singing the song of her people.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.200
She's just letting the other cats know that she has caught something.

50:58.200 --> 51:04.200
It's funny because Boomi and Fia don't do that.

51:04.200 --> 51:08.200
But they'll go and run to her, all concerned.

51:08.200 --> 51:13.200
Mr. Mime.

51:13.200 --> 51:18.200
I'll save it for the collab.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.200
Please check out Toma.

51:20.200 --> 51:28.200
I have a lot of collabs next week.

51:28.200 --> 51:39.200
Can you combine option two and three?

51:39.200 --> 51:43.200
Scottish cute and funny boys.

51:43.200 --> 51:50.200
I'm looking at you and I'm thinking that you're a bloody wanker.

51:50.200 --> 51:56.200
No, that's not gonna... that's hard, actually.

51:56.200 --> 51:59.200
I'm staring at you.

51:59.200 --> 52:03.200
I'm looking at you.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.200
Raina, what the fuck are you doing?

52:05.200 --> 52:08.200
I don't know what my cat is doing.

52:08.200 --> 52:15.200
Scotland Freda.

52:15.200 --> 52:19.200
This calypso is mean enough.

52:19.200 --> 52:24.200
All right, but I'm sorry condescending childhood friend one.

52:24.200 --> 52:26.200
Raina, please.

52:26.200 --> 52:31.200
Mommy is straight. Raina.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.200
Okay, I'm sorry.

52:32.200 --> 52:39.200
Go tell her that she's did a good job. Hold on.

52:39.200 --> 52:42.200
Hi.

52:42.200 --> 53:07.200
You're very full of energy today, huh?

53:08.200 --> 53:13.200
Oh, my God.

53:20.200 --> 53:24.200
She prays like that.

53:24.200 --> 53:26.200
Raina wants to collab.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.200
Give her a mic.

53:28.200 --> 53:32.200
Me as a podcast with Raina.

53:32.200 --> 53:35.200
Stare.

53:35.200 --> 53:38.200
I'm sorry.

53:38.200 --> 53:43.200
Just throwing out a guess here, but did something bad happen to you?

53:43.200 --> 53:47.200
It's like it has a twinge of alley girl, you know?

53:47.200 --> 53:54.200
That's why you're trying to drink and forget everything or...

53:54.200 --> 53:58.200
Sorry, excuse me.

53:58.200 --> 54:03.200
Are you trying to get me to go to your hostess club?

54:03.200 --> 54:05.200
Yeah, you're wrong.

54:05.200 --> 54:12.200
You just happened to catch my eye before I got to work.

54:12.200 --> 54:15.200
I'm feeling when I come on stream to mess with you.

54:15.200 --> 54:18.200
You come on stream to mess with me?

54:18.200 --> 54:19.200
I ain't even reading the rest of that.

54:19.200 --> 54:29.200
Maud's paying him by his piggy toes from the ceiling,

54:29.200 --> 54:36.200
spinning him around while you waterboard him.

54:36.200 --> 54:44.200
All right. Thank you.

54:44.200 --> 54:50.200
You look so tired as if your life is over.

54:50.200 --> 54:53.200
Oh, this is like really quiet.

54:53.200 --> 55:06.200
I put the BGM too quiet, I think.

55:06.200 --> 55:15.200
This is fucking loud.

55:15.200 --> 55:33.200
You look tired. I can fix that.

55:33.200 --> 55:43.200
Have you ever seen the grapefruit technique?

55:43.200 --> 55:47.200
My soul?

55:47.200 --> 55:49.200
The customers in my bar?

55:49.200 --> 55:53.200
I don't need to do anything for people to come to Wonderland.

55:53.200 --> 55:54.200
The classic technique.

55:54.200 --> 55:56.200
Just look up the grapefruit technique.

55:56.200 --> 55:59.200
Make sure you're alone though and that your headphones are in.

55:59.200 --> 56:04.200
So, you know, it's a beautiful black woman holding a grapefruit

56:04.200 --> 56:06.200
and she goes over her technique.

56:06.200 --> 56:08.200
So highly recommend it.

56:08.200 --> 56:20.200
Ladies that are watching.

56:20.200 --> 56:23.200
I was in a group when I saw the O.

56:23.200 --> 56:26.200
Bless your heart.

56:26.200 --> 56:30.200
Very great technique. 10 out of 10.

56:30.200 --> 56:33.200
It's nice to see that my male viewers are very progressive

56:33.200 --> 56:38.200
in using it as well. Good job, guys.

56:38.200 --> 56:45.200
Happy Pride.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.200
You might be right.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.200
I knew it. Yes.

56:49.200 --> 56:53.200
Oh, sorry. This isn't something to be happy about.

56:53.200 --> 56:57.200
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hit it right on the bullseye.

56:57.200 --> 57:00.200
It's so sad to think your life is over.

57:00.200 --> 57:03.200
Yeah, I know.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.200
What should I do?

57:05.200 --> 57:07.200
Oh, sorry, I'm thinking.

57:07.200 --> 57:09.200
What should I do if I invite him in?

57:09.200 --> 57:11.200
Then I'll really become a tout.

57:11.200 --> 57:13.200
What the fuck does that mean?

57:13.200 --> 57:17.200
But I can't leave someone so hurt out in the cold.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.200
Girl, what are you talking about?

57:19.200 --> 57:21.200
Why are you just talking?

57:21.200 --> 57:24.200
I'm right here. I can hear what you're fucking saying.

57:24.200 --> 57:26.200
Got it. You don't have to come into the shop.

57:26.200 --> 57:28.200
You can just have a sneak peek.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.200
That's right.

57:30.200 --> 57:33.200
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

57:33.200 --> 57:37.200
The truth is, I work here.

57:37.200 --> 57:39.200
Hello?

57:39.200 --> 57:42.200
One of those is actually me.

57:42.200 --> 57:45.200
The girl with the black bunny ears, they both fucking have them.

57:45.200 --> 57:47.200
The girl in the yellow, she's me.

57:47.200 --> 57:49.200
She's just me.

57:54.200 --> 57:57.200
Make sure if you ever have grapefruit,

57:57.200 --> 58:00.200
you shouldn't eat grapefruit while you're taking medication.

58:00.200 --> 58:02.200
It's not safe.

58:02.200 --> 58:07.200
Tip from your neighborhood.

58:07.200 --> 58:09.200
Dom.

58:09.200 --> 58:11.200
No.

58:15.200 --> 58:17.200
Literally human shit.

58:17.200 --> 58:19.200
No.

58:21.200 --> 58:24.200
I didn't know they opened this kind of bar here.

58:24.200 --> 58:27.200
It's someplace where I can drink with girls.

58:27.200 --> 58:30.200
I've never been in a shop like this before.

58:30.200 --> 58:32.200
It's clean and the girls are cute.

58:32.200 --> 58:36.200
I've only been to the really disgusting fucked up ones

58:36.200 --> 58:38.200
where the girls look like they have track marks up their arms.

58:38.200 --> 58:42.200
And have been huffing powder for hours.

58:42.200 --> 58:44.200
Excuse me, what are you saying?

58:44.200 --> 58:47.200
Sorry, I got off on a tangent.

58:47.200 --> 58:50.200
I guess I'll give it a try.

58:50.200 --> 58:54.200
Ah, you're gonna get me in trouble, sir.

58:54.200 --> 58:56.200
Huh, so I can't come in?

58:56.200 --> 59:00.200
Why the fuck did you show me this if I can't come in?

59:00.200 --> 59:02.200
That's all for today.

59:02.200 --> 59:04.200
I'll just give you a glimpse.

59:04.200 --> 59:06.200
If you come inside, then I'm really a tout.

59:06.200 --> 59:10.200
What the fuck is a tout?

59:10.200 --> 59:17.200
I give you the right to come to the shop as a customer.

59:17.200 --> 59:20.200
Since when the fuck do you give me the right to go to a bar

59:20.200 --> 59:23.200
where I pay money to hang out with you?

59:23.200 --> 59:26.200
Anyways, whenever you're interested, I'll be waiting for you to come.

59:26.200 --> 59:29.200
Why did you just ignore me?

59:29.200 --> 59:34.200
You're so sincere.

59:34.200 --> 59:36.200
Don't forget, your life isn't over.

59:36.200 --> 59:37.200
You'll be okay.

59:37.200 --> 59:39.200
I know you will.

59:39.200 --> 59:41.200
I can tell in your eyes.

59:41.200 --> 59:45.200
So please, hand over your wallet.

59:45.200 --> 59:46.200
Huh?

59:46.200 --> 59:48.200
I was just kidding.

59:48.200 --> 59:51.200
Right now, even if it was small, I know you smiled.

59:51.200 --> 59:53.200
My dick's not small.

59:53.200 --> 59:55.200
That means you're not done yet.

59:55.200 --> 59:58.200
Thanks, I guess, fucking bitch.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.200
I'll be here at the shop waiting for you.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.200
I'm looking forward to the next time we can see each other

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.200
and I can rinse your wallet.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.200
Alright, I'll let you go.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.200
What the fuck was her deal?

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200
She was so strange.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.200
She doesn't even know me.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.200
But I guess I do feel a little better.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.200
Kind of tinted in my pants, seeing that girl bent over that table.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.200
I'm such a simple guy.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.200
Now, I don't know...

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:30.200
I'm making myself fucking laugh.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.200
Now, I don't know if I really want to get drunk and forget everything.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.200
I just want to go home.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.200
Ellipses.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.200
What the fuck is all night?

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:52.200
I thought that was a weird version of the girl's poster.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.200
My life isn't over, huh?

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.200
Ellipses.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.200
No way.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.200
Why would I take something a girl said to me seriously

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.200
when I don't even know her name?

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.200
I don't even remember what her face looks like.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.200
I was just staring at her tits.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.200
She didn't seem to be joking around, but, you know, her tits.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.200
Ellipses.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.200
I mean, it's not like anyone has ever told me that my life is done.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.200
Besides me, I contemplated suicide probably about 30 minutes ago.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.200
I'm the only one who thinks that if I don't finish it myself,

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.200
maybe it's still possible to start again.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:36.200
Seriously, starts masturbating.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.200
Tout, a person soliciting customers.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.200
Oh.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:50.200
Attempt to sell something typically by pestering people in aggressive or bold manner.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.200
That doesn't make any fucking...

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.200
She wasn't even being aggressive, though.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:02:01.200
Why?

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.200
Oh, hello.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.200
I'm sorry for calling you without notice.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.200
You know how you were saying work was busy and you needed help?

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.200
Did you still need help?

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:17.200
If you'd like, would you take me in my anal virginity?

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.200
It's me on the other end.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.200
I'm like, fine, we'll hire you.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.200
Come on down to Wonderland.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.200
I didn't owe your mom a favor.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.200
It's been a week since I started my new job.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.200
What should I use my money on?

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.200
That being said, me being positive was all thanks to her.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.200
Not really.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.200
It was very superficial what she said because we just met.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.200
Should I go back to that chick shop?

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.200
Oh shit, okay.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:51.200
How much is that in American money?

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.200
Cool.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.200
This is more money I have in my bank account, probably.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.200
It's like 300 bucks?

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.200
Yep, still accurate.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.200
Oh baby, a triple.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.200
Oh baby, a triple.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.200
Thank you, Saber.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.200
Use my money on Sheeby.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.200
Aw, thank you.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.200
Your tips are appreciated.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.200
Tips for Dora?

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.200
Sheeby?

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:30.200
Somebody made a really hilarious edit of all of our debuts in 2.0 and I could not stop laughing.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.200
It's like 40 minutes long.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.200
I can't...

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.200
I think it's like Vealer debuts except it's just memes.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.200
Please give it a watch.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.200
You watched it?

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.200
It's so hilarious.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.200
I was crying laughing because he opens up my portion with...

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.200
Hey slaves!

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.200
I was dying laughing at Shrani's part.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.200
Aw, it's so fucking funny.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.200
Yeah, please watch it.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.200
Give that person some clicks.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.200
They deserve it for all the memes they threw in.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.200
It's so hilarious.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.200
Azur's was really funny too.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.200
So I can enter the shop.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.200
Save.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.200
Let's do it.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.200
Aw, look.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.200
I can't get out.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.200
No.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:30.200
Why can't I just click on stuff and I have to press my back button?

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.200
I can't go anywhere.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.200
I can...

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.200
Can I go to McKellen?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.200
Okay, I have to go to the shop.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.200
I can sleep.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.200
I can...

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.200
Aw, I am taking so many panty shots.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.200
Job hunting.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.200
Wait.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.200
I thought I had a job.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.200
Why would I need to get another job?

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.200
Gifted vacation?

01:04:54.200 --> 01:05:00.200
So this is just be a fucking sugar daddy simulator.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.200
I can gamble?

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.200
I'm rubbing my hands together.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200
Blackjack and hookers.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200
Blackjack and hookers.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.200
Blackjack and hookers.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.200
Phim Domson.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.200
Am I just a...

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.200
Am I just a piggy?

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.200
Am I just a little piggy?

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.200
Guys, by the way, I just want to let you know I don't do...

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:30.200
I don't do that side of BDSM because it's very manipulative.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:37.200
A lot of the women who do that side of BDSM only do it because they know they get money.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.200
They don't care about the people that they work with.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.200
They don't approve of it.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.200
I don't like it.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:49.200
I've been asked before if I will do financial domination.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.200
No.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.200
I am just me and you donate if you want to.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.200
And it is appreciated.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:13.200
I told my parents, by the way, I have a surprise for them because I'm going to give them the $200 that you guys donated in the stream where I mentioned that my dad was very sick.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.200
And so my parents were like, ooh, what's happening?

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.200
And I'm just going to give it to them.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:26.200
I'll tell you guys what their reaction will be because I know they'll really appreciate it.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.200
And they seemed like super like, what are you?

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.200
I'm like courtesy of my awesome streaming fans.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.200
And my parents are like, my dad was like, oh, emoji.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.200
And my mom was just like, oh, they're so sweet.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.200
So yeah, my parents do know that I live stream.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.200
They're very supportive.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:48.200
They know that I also do NSFW audios.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:53.200
I'm very honest with my parents.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.200
My dad, when I told them I got into Vealer, my mom was like, oh my gosh.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.200
Yay.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.200
And my dad was like, yay.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:06.200
And I'm like explaining to them the sort of content I'll be making like ASMR, my parents don't know what ASMR is.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:12.200
And then my dad's like, OK, I have to ask, are you doing any sex work?

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:19.200
And I literally was like, ehh, lude audios.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:28.400
He's like, I don't want to know, I don't want to know, but I will be taking my cut because

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:35.600
I taught you how to do voices and I'm like, fuck you dad.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:40.880
He's like, I'm just gonna take credit for your well, your great reading skills and your

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:47.800
ability to do voices and I would like my cut and I'm like, alright dad.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.560
He's like, just you know, 20% and I'm like, my mom's like, my mom's like, redacted, stop

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.800
it, stop teasing her.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.800
Then my mom's like, but I want to be on your channel.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.800
I'm like, okay.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:04.080
My parents are fucking leeches guys, just kidding, no they're very supportive.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.360
I love them to death, they're very proud of me because they know I've wanted to be a content

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.720
creator for a very long time.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.360
I think it was this shop here, I'm a bit nervous though, why is this, they have like

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:26.040
a menu outside, like it's a restaurant, me more tea, parents are sick, oh, anonymous

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:34.800
tipped $1, thank you anonymous queen, our entire singular dollar from your pay piggy.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.600
Good job piggy.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:42.400
Now we're going to do a retweet game where I'm going to have everybody retweet and every

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:48.240
five retweets is $5 and whatever the else the fuck that they say when they do those

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:55.520
weird ass things and then I want to get a manicure and then you're a piggy.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.160
I'm going to rinse the pig, give me your wallet.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:12.120
VodCon, she's unnatural, no it's because, so when I first, when I finally was able to

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:19.800
log into my NSFW, I mean my alternative account on Twitter, I was like trying to go through

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:26.560
and there's just like a lot of like fucking like sex bots and I'm like okay and like the

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:34.440
majority of them were goddesses and queens and mistresses and they were all just doing

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.440
like, like had that verbiage and I'm like what the fuck is, like I'm like why is this

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440
on my timeline?

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:46.360
And I started just like following like anti-artists and retubers and then I finally went away.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:50.960
I'm like fuck this timeline, I don't want these bitches on my timeline.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:58.480
It's free money, yeah but I don't feel good about it.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.480
Like a tip is different because you're tipping me because you're enjoying my content.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:11.400
What they're doing is they're, they're, like they're not doing it because they want to

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:17.360
assist in, trying to say this so that it's okay for you two but at this point I kind

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.360
of don't give a fuck.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:30.000
They don't really care about like helping out their little piggy, you know, they just

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.160
want the money, they don't care about like the actual like relationship of it and it's

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:44.480
like the respect of it because there's, yeah I don't know, never mind.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.120
Yeah, they're not really entertainers, it's like like and the girls just like had their

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:56.920
fucking feet out and they're like send me a tribute of $20 to DM me and I'm like what

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.480
the fuck is this?

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:06.400
It just, ah I'm sorry, just like it genuinely like irritates me but yeah but then just donate,

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:13.720
who donate, enjoy that but I also think I'm like it's kind of, it's kind of predatory.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:20.080
Unless you have a lot of expendable income, you know, but I don't judge the people who

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.720
get pleasure from it, I don't, that's fine, you do you.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:31.880
I'm not a huge fan of the people that take advantage of those people, that's it.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.120
And those bots are annoying and most of them are fake anyways so most people are just DMing

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:49.400
some random cash app of like a dude in Texas who stole his wife's feed picks and is rinsing

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.400
out piggies.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.960
But hey, at least I'm in his family could get to Disney.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:03.360
Problem is that some of those men are just having their low impulse control ticket,

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:10.640
that's what I mean, that's another point, like there's that as well, 100%.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.400
I would like to YouTube money but I gotta admit, yeah.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:26.960
I want someone like, first and foremost, take care of yourself, that's all I say.

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.600
A day in white tipped one dollar, so what you're saying is they want the tip but don't care

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:37.040

You know, it's important, you don't crush the center, it's the sides of the neck because

This is going against what the fuck are you talking about.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.160
This is Reverse Findem, we are being financially submissified.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:47.160
Oh my god, I'm not even trying to do like reverse psychology or anything, you guys are

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.160

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:06.160

It's me going, I'm going to pre, how dare you financially support me especially since

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.160
office jobs suck.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:46.160
Yeah, it's kind of like, I have this weird thing where I'm like, I like, like I want

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:51.160

mostly rely on you guys for, to just like let me live.

syndrome, like don't spend your money on me.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.160
Cause I'm like, I have like, I have a part time job now and I'm doing okay.

Anyways, anyways, enough of that fucking shit.

I hope my neighbors can't hear me, cause I was stuck.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.160
Shibi was my first ever exposure that led me to the other girls.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.160
And I found her funny and amusing.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.160
I couldn't wait until debut and streams began.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.160

You can't see me.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.160

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.160
Hello.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.160
Hi.

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160
I'm far away.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.160
Um, like I added.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.160
You guys are gonna make fun of me and that's okay.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.160
I don't mind it.

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.160
Cause I'm a grown bitch.

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.160
All right.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.160
If you're going to call me a bitch,

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.160
you better put sense in it in front of it.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.160
Um, but I put on my throne a bed frame.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160
Because I'm a grown bitch.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.160
I'm a grown bitch.

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160
I'm a grown bitch.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.160
I'm a grown bitch.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.160
I'm a grown bitch.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.160
Um, but I put on my throne a bed frame because I don't have one.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.160
I've been sleeping on a mattress on the floor for almost two years now.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:37.160
Like, you know, that one picture of that guy, like, like he's like, uh, right.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.160
My apartment is like a TV in like a lawn chair.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.160
My apartment was that for the longest time.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.160
And you guys are just so nice.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.160
Somebody bought me a bed frame and I'm like,

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160
Oh my God.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.160
Oh my God.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.160
I don't have to sleep on the floor.

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.160
Uh, people are too kind.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:06.160
That's like, I, I hope that like when I become big enough,

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.160
I can spread that sort of love, you know,

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.160
like, uh, do like, uh, charity streams.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.160
I think that would be really cool.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.160
That would be really neat.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.160
The water, ah!

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.160
It's burning myself in the water.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.160
But yeah, like, I would love to also just like help out smaller creators

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.160
by like, collabing with smaller creators or like, um,

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.160
maybe like,

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:45.160
picking someone in a community who like wants to be a Vtuber, like helping them fund their model.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.160
I feel like that would probably go bad, but you know, I'm just too nice for my own fucking good.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160
We need help. Okay.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:01.160
I know someone who's went to UK and still does on the streamer.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.160
I remember it when I, um, one of my friends,

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:09.160
she like, uh, one of my, like, um, Jesus fuck.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.160
Anonymous tipped $50.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.160
Here's to a future bed frame.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.160
Also, give some to your dad.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.160
No, I have a bed frame, but thank you.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.160
I will.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:22.160
I'll let him buy some of my comic books or something.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.160
He'll treat himself.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:30.160
It's like, I don't know, like, Starbucks coffee or something.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:37.160
When I first started streaming, one of the people I became a mutuals with,

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.160
she just, she started streaming later than me,

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:44.160
and then someone donated her 7k dot, like 7k.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:48.160
I remember the context as to why they were just like,

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:51.160
and just like whipped it at her during stream.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.160
And I'm sitting there watching the stream.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.160
I'm like, what the fuck?

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.160
Like people just like, people are, yeah.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:59.160
I was like, holy crap.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:04.160
People just like, I just, I just want to know, I'm like, what did they do as a job?

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.160
Like, you know those guys that like do this tiktoks?

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.160
They're like, hey, what do you do for a living?

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.160
I just want to ask those people what they do for a living.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.160
Just buy one big bed frame and combine them.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.160
Crazy.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:27.160
I imagine like a, like a Saudi prince just like really being obsessed with VTubers.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:30.160
That's actually kind of awesome.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:35.160
But, um, like, but it's, but it's you guys.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.160
Like, I need to make this point to you.

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:43.160
It's you guys that keep the VTubing community afloat.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:50.160
Don't ever forget that without our fan base, there would be no us.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.160
There would be no VTuber and VTubing.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.160
So that's why your support means a lot.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.160
However, you know, there's a fine line just because you do donate.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:09.160
It does not mean you're entitled to all the VTubers attention, et cetera.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:20.160
Just, yeah, I don't think I really need to elaborate on that because you are all adults, mostly some of you, I presume, here.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.160
I'm going to get rich so I can do the ties, right?

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:36.160
Like, I like, so like, I always said to myself, I'm like, okay, if I ever blow up and become like a VTuber, fuck you, money, I'm just throwing it at other streamers.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.160
I'm just fucking you.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160
Left, right.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160
You get cash.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.160
You get cash.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.160
You get cash.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.160
Because I'm not someone who like needs a lot.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.160
Like, I'm cool.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.160
All I want is a house and I'm good.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160
I want a house and debt-free.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:54.160
I'm just living with my cats and my chickens and my goats and my quail.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.160
I decided I want quail, by the way.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.160
And I want to run a rescue and that's it.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.160
That's it.

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.160
That's it.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.160
I don't care for fucking fancy cars.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.160
I don't wear a designer because that's fucking stupid.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.160
So I'm like, yeah, we're chilling.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.160
We're chilling.

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.160
And my BDSM room.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.160
Yep.

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:28.160
Imagine I get a house and I just have like a red room from like 50 Shades and I just

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.160
film everything in there.

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:36.160
I have like the cat cam and it's just like, there's a little like bed and on a like,

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.160
like human furniture.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:42.160
Like I have somebody just like sitting there, just like holding my cats up.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.160
No peacocks.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.160
I don't know what I would do with peacocks when I sell the feathers.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:59.160
And I also want to pay off my mom's debt and my dad's debt and buy my parents a house.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:07.160
I mean, it's like an overlay but I'll, I guess, considering you're a Don Lorwitz.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.160
Don't go to the basement.

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.160
That's where Mercy is though.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.160
She lives in my, the apartment below me.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.160
The like, the, what is it?

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.160
Like the in-law suite or whatever it's called.

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.160
I don't remember what it's called.

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.160
I don't know if they call it the same thing in other places outside of America.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:29.160
But like normally there's like a whole other like livable space below like the main house

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.160
that usually people like have their family live in.

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160
So Mercy's down there.

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.160
She's in the basement with her, you know, senpai.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.160
She likes to tie up.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160
She doesn't question it or anything.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160
And keeps all, yeah, exactly.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160
She keeps all you guys there.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.160
Feelers just want to go.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.160
I made a joke.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.160
I'm like, viewer content house when?

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.160
And we were all like, ah.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:58.160
It's just Zoe burger but like V2 burgers.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160
You could sell farm.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.160
That's what I want to do.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.160
I want to sell chicken eggs.

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.160
And I want to sell quail eggs.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.160
And Strani is like this.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.160
I'm telling you, me and her are the same person.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:19.160
I'm just brown and she's Scottish because she said she wants to do the same exact thing.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:27.160
And she just wants to have a little nice sanctuary in this like live in the countryside or some shit

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160
and take care of her animals.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.160
And I love her for that.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.160
Has any content house gone well?

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.160
No.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.160
We're changing that.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.160
We all have to move to one country for our content.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:39.160
I don't know.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.160
What would be the best place for us to move?

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:48.160
What kind of brown on you?

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.160
The biracial kind?

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160
I don't know.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.160
What flavor of black are you?

01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.160
Texas.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.160
I'm not fucking going to Texas.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.160
No, I have had people.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:08.160
So like, again, I work in retail.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.160
People always because I'm very ethnically ambiguous looking.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:18.160
I got mistaken for so many different things because I just, I don't know.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.160
I'm like fucking mystique from X-Men.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.160
I just look like everybody except Asian.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.160
Actually, no, that's a lie.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.160
One time somebody thought I was Malaysian.

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:32.160
They thought I was mixed because how I like did my makeup and like it was when I was really into K-pop idols.

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:39.160
So I did my makeup like them and it gave me a little bit of like a little Malaysian look and I was like, I look hot as fuck.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.160
But I'm not Asian.

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.160
I'm blue.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.160
Yes, I'm blue.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.160
What's my hex code?

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.160
Hey, but what kind of would you ever want to come up here?

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:59.160
I've actually been, yeah, this is, I guess this is Zatsu so much for playing a game.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.160
I hate myself.

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.160
I've been to Quebec and I've been to Montreal.

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:08.160
Oh, I do like those places.

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.160
I love Zatsu.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.160
Every stream is a Zatsu in disguise.

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.160
This is like aim stream?

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:28.160
It's because I get distracted and I go off on tangents and then I want to elaborate on those tangents.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:31.160
And then you guys ask me another question and then I get more.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.160
It's your fault.

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.160
It's all I'm going to say.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.160
Oh, her name is, how the fuck do I know her name now?

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.160
Ah, hold on.

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.160
I need to sip a tea before I start this.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.160
I don't even, I'm not even diagnosed ADHD.

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.160
I'm just, I'm just fucking weird.

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.160
Chat reflects the streamer.

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.160
Good point.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:57.160
Nine more hours and we hit the daily and strength interns quota.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.160
I don't even get questioned.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:03.160
People thought I was Chinese, Japanese, Korean, but I'm Filipino.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.160
Just monolingual and stuff.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.160
Yeah, I understand.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.160
Um, oh yeah.

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.160
But my, my story, I'm just going to do it.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:12.160
Then I'll do, um, I'll say my story, then I'll continue with the game.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.160
I fucking promise.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.160
I'm adding to my goal list.

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:22.160
Like actually do nothing but a game for the, for two hours.

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.160
Well, that'll kind of, well, good thing we're playing power,

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.160
power watch simulator tomorrow.

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.160
Cause then I can, yeah, and game.

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.160
I'll probably just end up standing around and the girls are doing all the work

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.160
and I'm just like, no, no, no, no, no.

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:35.160
Shabby, shut up.

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.160
Okay.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:44.160
Um, so this person came in and they were speaking to me and they were

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.160
speaking to me and Spanish.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.160
And I'm like, Lo siento, no hablas español.

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.160
Um, I only speak English.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.160
And they were just like, what?

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:58.160
And I'm like, yeah, they're like, but you look Spanish.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.160
And I'm like, I'm not.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:03.160
They're just like, yeah, but you're Spanish.

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.160
And I'm like, but I'm not.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.160
And they're like, you're Spanish.

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.160
I'm like, I'm, I'm black.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.160
And they're like, no, you're not.

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.160
And I'm like, what the fuck?

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.160
They're like, you don't look black.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:20.160
And I'm like, my mom is white.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.160
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.160
I'm Mr. Worldwide.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.160
I'm Shibi Worldwide.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:31.160
And the person's just like, well, you look Spanish.

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.160
You should learn Spanish.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.160
And they're like, okay, what type of black are you?

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:39.160
I'm like, I'm Haitian.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.160
I'm half, I'm half Haitian.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.160
And then I'm like a bunch of other white things.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:50.160
Literally, I have like a 15 thing list on my mom's side of what I am.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.160
And they're just like, oh, but like, Haiti's like right next to the Dominican.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.160
So you're pretty much Spanish.

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.160
And I'm like, oh my fucking god.

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:05.160
You're like, you came from there?

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:08.160
I'm like, no, I was, I was born in America.

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.160
Please.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:22.160
And I'm just sitting there and then they would like speak in like Spanglish to me.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:29.160
And it's also hard because I, because I worked at my job for so long and we have a very large Spanish speaking population.

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:34.160
I do know quite a bit of Spanish and I could kind of usually follow along to what people are saying.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:38.160
So she would slip into Spanish and I would just respond in English.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:43.160
And so she's like, she looked at me and said, you're fucking lying to me in Spanish.

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.160
And I'm like, no, I'm not lying to you.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.160
She's like, how do you know what I'm saying?

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.160
And I'm like, I'm, I just know a little bit of Spanish.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.160
Like, what are you?

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:57.160
The racial mental gymnastics.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:11.160
But it's funny because then like, but it's, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm not going to tell you my last name,

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:17.160
but I will say my last name is Arabic, but I'm not Arabic.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:21.160
I'm not, I don't even know where that comes from.

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:31.160
And so people, customers who hear my last name that are like Middle Eastern or from Africa or from what they're just like,

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.160
Oh, speaks to me in Arabic.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:41.160
And I'm just like, and then I have people who are from Egypt because apparently I look at gypsy and they're like speaks to me in the main language of Egypt.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:49.160
And I'm like, no, I have people who think I'm like Cape Verdean and they're just like speaks to me in Cape Verdean.

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.160
And then I also know a little bit of Chinese.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:56.160
So people will be like, Oh, are you half Chinese?

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.160
I'm like, no.

01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.160
All I said was Ni Hao Ma.

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.160
What was she?

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.160
She's here.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.160
That's all I know.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.160
Yeah.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.160
My last name.

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.160
Yeah, cotton bum is an Arabic last name.

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:19.160
I don't know though.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:31.160
But yeah, I'm very, it's very fun because I usually, because customers will be like, okay, what are you?

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.160
I'm like, guess.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.160
And so I get like the widest fucking range of guesses.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:42.160
You know that like one guy who, um, what's his name?

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.160
Thanks to Cody Co.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.160
Noel Miller.

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.160
Is that his name?

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.160
Yeah.

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.160
Who did like, they were like big on vine and all that shit.

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.160
You know how everybody like tries to guess his race?

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:54.160
That is how my customers are with me.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.160
Just learn Spanish.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.160
Full of Duolingo.

01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.160
Because I don't even know what Noel Miller is.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.160
I'm like, is he Asian?

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:04.160
Is he Spanish?

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.160
Is he something else?

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.160
Is he just white?

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.160
In the end, I'm just a guy.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.160
I'm sorry if that breaks your immersion.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.160
Apologize.

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.160
I know some people don't like to hear about this sort of stuff, but I'm an honest person and I like to talk and I like to yeah.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.160
So, and then you would have fucking found out anyways when you see my tan ass hand.

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:33.160
On a hand cam stream.

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:36.160
Or my legs on a thigh cam stream.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:39.160
You'd be like, Leonardo DiCaprio point.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.160
What the fuck is that?

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:46.160
My immersion.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.160
I do have bunny ears though.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.160
I genuinely have bunny ears.

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.160
Don't, don't forget that like I actually have bunny ears.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.160
I was born with a deformity.

01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.160
I don't like to talk about it.

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.160
I do have bunny ears.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.160
I don't have human ears.

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:03.160
I just have bunny ears.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.160
Yep.

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.160
It's fine.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:11.160
YouTube just tends to add a lighter filter.

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.160
That's actually true though.

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:20.160
When I was streaming on Twitch and I did my first hand cam doing like kind of the cooking popping the popping cooking that like Emmy did.

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:28.160
My hands look so fucking white on Twitch for my webcam.

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:33.160
The people were like, why the fuck are you talking about being proud?

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:36.160
And I'm like, no, the saturation was down.

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.160
The lighting was bad.

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:45.160
I'm telling you, I haven't been outside in many moons.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.160
I changed colors.

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.160
I'm a fucking chameleon.

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:54.160
Sure.

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:59.160
My white mother laughs at me in the daily because she's darker than me right now.

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:06.160
Yes, I am working on getting a tan toggle for my avatar for my avatar for me.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.160
What the fuck am I saying?

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.160
This isn't avatar the last airbender or the blue people.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:13.160
My vitamin D deficient.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.160
Yes.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.160
Yes, I am.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.160
Give me some of that D.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.160
Sunny D.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.160
Unleash the power of the sun.

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.160
Am I right?

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.160
Well, no, it'll be a toggle.

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.160
I'm going to be pulling an iron mouse.

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.160
I've already said that.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.160
Pulling an iron mouse.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:38.160
I'm going to be she be cotton bum and she be copper bum.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.160
Instead of copper cat.

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160
Copper.

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.160
Copper bum.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.160
Ah, yes.

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.160
Is it me streaming today?

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.160
I haven't looked at the fucking schedule.

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:08.160
Log in.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.160
No, she's not streaming today.

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.160
Okay.

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:16.160
I'll stream a little bit past my time so we can actually get to game.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.160
Is there in two hours?

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.160
Okay, I'll probably, I'll stream into a zero then.

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.160
Any relation to Rodney copper?

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.160
No.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:31.160
I am canonically related to every bunny character.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:38.160
However, distant related to Mr. Hopps and Lola Bunny, Jessica Rabbit,

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.160
and all other bunny VTubers also fall under that sphere.

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:45.160
The AutoCast fashion one.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.160
At some point.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.160
If only there was a combined schedule for other girls that we can see.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.160
Well, we have our own little thing for that.

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.160
I just looked at it.

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.160
You guys can make your own.

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.160
I think Manesan is working on updating the website,

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:07.160
so it does show all of our schedules.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.160
That would actually be really cool.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.160
Bonnie from FNA- yes.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.160
BigChunkus is a cousin of mine.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.160
Jessica Rabbit was just her married name.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:20.160
Yeah, because I'm related to Roger Rabbit.

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:25.160
And Jessica is related to me by marriage.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.160
Yep.

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.160
LowPunny is my first cousin once.

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.160
No.

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.160
No.

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.160
This is not Alabama.

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.160
Bugs Bunny.

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.160
Yeah, they're related to me.

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.160
Related to JoJo Rabbit.

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.160
I actually watched them the other day.

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:44.160
It was pretty actually fucking funny.

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.160
I love Taiko.

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.160
I didn't finish it though.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.160
I think I fell asleep.

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.160
You can see the resemblance.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.160
Yeah.

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.160
Although, how do we have resemblance if she's related to me by marriage, guys?

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.160
Related to Peter Rabbit.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.160
He's a...

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:07.160
Any anthropomorphic bunnies,

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:09.160
like LowPunny because she's like a Pokemon,

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:12.160
but she doesn't have sentience like a human like Bugs does.

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.160
They are not really...

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.160
They are extremely distant.

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.160
Extremely distant, you know?

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.160
Okay, is it funny or is it boring that you fell asleep midway?

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:27.160
No, I just fell...

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:29.160
I was just up really late.

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.160
And I just...

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:33.160
Sometimes, you know how you put something on to fall asleep too?

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.160
Or just to listen to?

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.160
I was really into the first half.

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.160
I literally...

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.160
I think 30 minutes or 40 minutes to finish.

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:46.160
Yes, I do have acme powers.

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:52.160
And my acme powers, it means I can inflate, flatten out,

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:54.160
do a lot of different things.

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.160
Just like, you know, how Bugs Bunny does in cartoons

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.160
and Roger Rabbit, I am...

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:02.160
I do have toon powers.

01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.160
I do have toon powers, yep.

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.160
So basically, exactly.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.160
Just like Luffy.

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.160
Toon for you, exactly.

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.160
No.

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.160
No inflation.

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.160
None of that.

01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.160
None of that inflation cake, please.

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.160
Chibi Chungus.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.160
Does paint thinner kill you?

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.160
It hurts a little.

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.160
Like it burns a little.

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:34.160
It's like when you stick your hand on a hot stove,

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.160
but it won't kill me.

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:41.160
You're not Google Sonic.

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:44.160
I wasn't planning on Googling Sonic inflation.

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:47.160
It's too late, you're canonizing.

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:48.160
I am...

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.160
I can retcon it too.

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.160
I can retcon it too, bitch.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.160
Won't kill you, but this is mean you'll enjoy it.

01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.160
Exactly.

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.160
Inflation in this economy.

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.160
Cartoon versus anime jeans.

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.160
Exactly, because like I have my anime jeans

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:12.160
and I have my cartoon jeans, you know?

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.160
Who are my parents?

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.160
I don't know.

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.160
To be honest with you, I don't know who my parents are.

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.160
My RTX parents, they're pretty cool,

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:23.160
but my 2D parents, I don't really know too much about them.

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.160
One might be, you know, one might be just like,

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.160
I don't like, there is a family rumor.

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:32.160
I kind of try to ignore it that Jessica Rabbit is my mom

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:36.160
and that she cheated on Roger with bugs

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:40.160
or it's like Lola cheated on bugs with Roger.

01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:42.160
I don't know the truth of that.

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.160
So I try not to worry about it too much

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.160
because you know, I'm not trying to,

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.160
I don't need, I already have like a familial relationship with them.

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.160
I don't want to fuck it up, you know?

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.160
I don't want to make it weird by being like,

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.160
oh, like taking paternity tests and all that shit, you know?

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.160
What the fuck am I on right now?

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:04.160
You know, it's just like, you know, weird family stuff.

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:08.160
Weird family stuff.

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.160
Yeah, or Lola cheated on bugs with Jessica.

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.160
I don't know.

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:12.160
I don't know how that works.

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:16.160
There was a rumor that, you know,

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.160
on Jessica was packing.

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.160
I don't know.

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:22.160
Okay, we're crazy.

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.160
The chat for 14 of my immortal.

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:27.160
Random Lord.

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.160
Oh yeah, what the fuck was I doing?

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:31.160
Oh yeah, playing a game.

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:34.160
I literally just talked for two hours.

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.160
What the fuck?

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:45.160
I didn't even play the fucking game.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.160
All right.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.160
I need a sip of tea.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.160
Jessica Rabbit canonically rugged.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.160
What?

01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.160
Yeah, retract that message.

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.160
What the fuck is that?

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.160
I should play there is no game like that one.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.160
And then just like, just talk the other time

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.160
because there's no game because I'm just talking.

01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:18.160
Uh, the customer who looked tired.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.160
You came.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:20.160
Yeah, I did.

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:22.160
That's right.

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.160
The customer who came.

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:24.160
I mean, who looked tired.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.160
I'm here.

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.160
It makes me happy.

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:31.160
Oh, are you feeling nervous?

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:32.160
Is this...

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:35.160
Why are the dudes in the back fucking unlockable characters?

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.160
Is this your first time at a place like this?

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.160
Is that guy over there?

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.160
Okay.

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.160
Like he doesn't have a face.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:44.160
Don't worry about it.

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:45.160
Uh, okay.

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.160
Well, that's right.

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.160
I've never been here.

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.160
I see.

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.160
Well, then I guess I'll give you a brief explanation

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:53.160
on how it works because you haven't started

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:54.160
the fucking game yet.

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.160
It's been two hours.

01:44:58.160 --> 01:44:59.160
I love the dude profile.

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.160
It's to give the main character.

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:04.160
Please.

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.160
I don't know anything.

01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:06.160
So this will help.

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.160
The name of the shop is Bunny Garden,

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:11.160
a fun place to drink.

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:12.160
We're run.

01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:15.160
We're owned by Wonderland Enterprises.

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.160
The CEO is Shibi...

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:18.160
Shut the fuck up.

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.160
You can't say her name.

01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:20.160
I'm sure you can't say...

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.160
Okay, sorry.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.160
Never mind one of the girls said I can't talk about it.

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.160
That's all.

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:28.160
Oh, uh, seems like I should understand,

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.160
but I don't.

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:32.160
Well, you'll gradually get used to it.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.160
So it's okay.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.160
I'll be really happy if you come here lots of times.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.160
You'll come here...

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.160
Lots of times, won't you?

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.160
You'll come...

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.160
Here...

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:47.160
In my Bunny Garden...

01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:50.160
Lots of times, right?

01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:57.160
Anyways...

01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.160
I agree.

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.160
To do that, I have to work hard at my current job

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.160
because I have to take responsibility.

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.160
Well then,

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.160
I want you to be able to do your best

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.160
so I hope I can give you a lot of healing.

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.160
Drop your pants!

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:27.160
This is really good tea.

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.160
I'm sorry, I choked a little bit a moment ago.

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.160
So sorry.

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.160
Okay.

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:38.160
What's commence?

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:43.160
If I feel if I work harder,

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.160
my dick gets hard.

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.160
I'll feel better.

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:47.160
Why did you say it?

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:48.160
Don't worry about it.

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:49.160
It's decided!

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:52.160
I didn't hear your order.

01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:54.160
Here you are.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.160
This is the menu.

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.160
Right.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.160
Maybe you'll have a drink.

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.160
You guys got...

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.160
Wait, what's...

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.160
Icy Nade,

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.160
and Sheeby Nade,

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.160
and Amy Nade,

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.160
and Azura Nade,

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.160
and Mercy Nade,

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.160
and Strani Nade.

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:16.160
It's in a section called Lemon Nades.

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.160
Can you elaborate?

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:21.160
It just says in the description

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.160
fresh from the source.

01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:23.160
What does that mean?

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.160
Sorry, I can't elaborate on the drink menu.

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.160
You'll have to talk to my superior.

01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.160
Okay.

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.160
I guess I'll just have a normal drink then.

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.160
What drink did you want?

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:40.160
A pricier drink could increase...

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.160
A pricier drink can increase my likability?

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.160
What the fuck?

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:50.160
Can I...

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.160
I'll have to use my arrows.

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.160
Where's the sound?

01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:55.160
Oh, my headphones are turned off.

01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:58.160
Excuse me.

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.160
I feel like I need to spend a bag.

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.160
Oh, wait, I have to use these.

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:12.160
Which is the most expensive drink on the menu?

01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:16.160
Jesus fuck.

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.160
Bunny trap?

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:28.160
I'll take the House Lemon Sour.

01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:32.160
Oh, so the Immy Nade.

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:34.160
Yeah, whatever.

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.160
I want to drink something too.

01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.160
I have to buy you a drink?

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.160
Is this what...

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:43.160
like bars are like?

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.160
Like some bars are in Japan?

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.160
Cause like I've never been to like a maid cafe

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.160
or like any of that stuff.

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.160
Again, I'm very...

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.160
I don't have a sort of thing in America.

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.160
Cabaret bars?

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:54.160
It's a hostess club?

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.160
Yeah, we don't have those around.

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.160
That's really actually...

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.160
I'm like thinking, I'm like,

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:03.160
wait, that'd be a good job.

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.160
It's like Hooters, except they buy you drinks.

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.160
If you don't drink them to drinks,

01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:08.160
they'll pour...

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:10.160
What if one of the girls gets fucking shit-faced?

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:14.160
Cause if you don't drink them to drinks,

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:15.160
they'll pour...

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:17.160
What if one of the girls gets fucking shit-faced?

01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:20.160
Cause if you don't drink them to drinks,

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:22.160
cause if you're like hanging out

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.160
and drinking with people all the time,

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.160
like if like, you have five customers

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.160
and they just keep buying you drinks,

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.160
like are you limited to like one customer?

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:35.160
Like what is how does...

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.160
What's the...

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.160
I need an explanation here.

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.160
Actually, yeah,

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.160
I remember someone said they were like

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.160
trying to make a VTuber hostess bar.

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.160
That would actually be really fucking cool.

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:49.160
Like do you like hologram, Miku?

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.160
Except make it a VTuber 3D model.

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.160
And I will gladly sit and have a drink with you

01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.160
and then I'll probably die

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.160
because I can't handle all the call that will.

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:03.160
I'll buy you some...

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.160
a special highball.

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.160
Actually, you're a nice lady.

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.160
I'm gonna buy you a fine wine.

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:16.160
Oh, this is great.

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:17.160
I love this.

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:20.160
Whoa.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.160
Hello?

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.160
I can zoom?

01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:43.160
I can give them presents?

01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.160
Holy shit.

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.160
So being a hostess bar is literally like

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:53.160
being a girlfriend in a hoe without the sex.

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:55.160
And you just gotta be nice to people.

01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:59.160
I would be so fucking good at that.

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:03.160
Cause like I have a very nice and charismatic personality.

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:04.160
Just saying.

01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:05.160
Look it.

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:07.160
There's a couple of you guys here.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.160
It means you like me.

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:13.160
GFE for a night?

01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:16.160
Fendom but with interaction?

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.160
No, cause like...

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:21.160
Fendom, like usually the dimes only take, they don't give.

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:33.160
Thank you, Velvet Queen.

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:40.160
Absolute mad lad Velvet Queen with the 127?

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:45.160
I'm literally talking about...

01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:48.160
I'm getting panty shots and people are giving me 100 bucks.

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:49.160
What's wrong with it?

01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:51.160
There's something wrong with this picture.

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:53.160
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.160
I'm doing a little heart.

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.160
I'm doing a little heart.

01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:57.160
A little sa-dang-yay for you.

01:51:58.160 --> 01:51:59.160
They bought me a drink.

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:00.160
It was a very expensive drink.

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.160
Thank you.

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.160
How do I zoom?

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.160
How do I zoom?

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:12.160
Let me zoom it.

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:15.160
I'm like fucking a...

01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:19.160
I can't even remember the meme.

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:20.160
I just want to zoom.

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.160
It's chat.

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:25.160
Did you even tell me your name?

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.160
I'm getting kind of nervous.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:32.160
I mean, it's going to be the first time I meet this next customer.

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:34.160
You know I'm right here.

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:37.160
Like I can hear everything you're saying out loud.

01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:40.160
My heart feels like it's going to explode from how fast it's racing.

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:42.160
Why are you ignoring me?

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:45.160
Oh, what am I saying?

01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:48.160
The purpose of this place is to make customers feel relaxed.

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.160
Not stressed.

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:54.160
Yeah, but you're stressing me out because you're acting fucking crazy talking to yourself.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:58.160
If I'm in a state like this, I'm sure the customer is going to feel the same.

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:00.160
Come on now, you've got this.

01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.160
Bitch, what the fuck are you on?

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:06.160
Sorry, I'm schizophrenic.

01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:08.160
Okay, let's start off with the reasonable.

01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:09.160
Huh?

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:11.160
The first step in the order is to become friends.

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:15.160
You're the customer, so please go right ahead with everything you've got.

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.160
You can't see what I'm doing, so I'm taking my arm.

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:20.160
I'm throwing it over my shoulder.

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:24.160
I'm throwing it in front of myself like I have a giant cock.

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:27.160
That's my first step.

01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:32.160
You like what you see?

01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.160
Huh?

01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:41.160
I mean...

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:46.160
She said, show me what you got, so I showed her what I got.

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:50.160
You're fine, don't worry about it.

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:54.160
I hurt my elbow.

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.160
Oh my god.

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:00.160
She's my words carefully.

01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:02.160
What a better hug.

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:04.160
What, no hug?

01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:08.160
There was a dude at my job that would do that, and I fucking hated him.

01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.160
He'd be like, where's my hug?

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:12.160
I'm like, non-existent.

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:14.160
Sorry, a customer is calling, bye.

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:18.160
I'm sorry, if you do that to girls, you're fucking annoying.

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:19.160
Where my hug at?

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:25.160
And then, sometimes, because like for me...

01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:33.160
So I have OCD and certain like feelings and like pressure and textures.

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:35.160
Maybe I'm just autistic.

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:37.160
Really bother me.

01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:46.160
I don't like to be hugged too much unless I really like you or for like a really close family member or family friend or my parents.

01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:53.160
Like I literally will only let like Salem and Olive and my parents hug me and my family members.

01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:56.160
But like when like...

01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:03.160
Because I'll say like people are like really touchy-feely and like, I don't know, like I'm just not like that.

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:09.160
Yeah, I'm sorry, physical touch is not my love language.

01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:12.160
Naturally as a dom, it's acts of service.

01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:16.160
So get on your knees and eat this cushy-coochie.

01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.160
Madam Desiree Savis?

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:25.160
I need a bell.

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.160
I need a bell to ring.

01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:28.160
Do I have a bell?

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:29.160
I know I have a fucking bell.

01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:32.160
Well, it's not a bell actually.

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:36.160
It's, I think it's my candle snuffer.

01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:37.160
Snuffing?

01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:38.160
Let's see where it is.

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:40.160
But it like sounds like a bell.

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:49.160
Oh, it's not dinging.

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:54.160
Usually it makes a ding noise.

01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:56.160
Damn it.

01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:59.160
Matty perquias dick!

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:02.160
Dick actus once!

01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:05.160
Just imagine bell noises, okay?

01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.160
Thank you.

01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:16.160
Or coochie.

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.160
We don't discriminate in this household.

01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:19.160
Okay.

01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.160
So a toast or something?

01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:25.160
That's what I just fucking said.

01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:28.160
That's the spirit.

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.160
You seem eager to start drinking.

01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:32.160
But don't you think sharing each other's names comes first?

01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.160
Well, by the little bar that's next to your body,

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:37.160
I can kind of surmise your name is Kanna,

01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:42.160
or Kanna, or can I eat your pussy out tonight?

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.160
What?

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:44.160
Never mind.

01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:48.160
Anyways, I'd love to know more about you.

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:49.160
Right.

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:51.160
My name is Haito Kanna.

01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:52.160
Yeah, Kanda.

01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:57.160
I will butcher Japanese names.

01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:59.160
I apologize to my Japanese friends.

01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:04.160
The Vaude staying up!

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:06.160
Relax, the Vaude staying up.

01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:08.160
Relax.

01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:09.160
Oh, I just remembered,

01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:13.160
because I just see someone with Oshimarks in their name

01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:14.160
that aren't mine.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.160
Fuck you, first of all.

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:16.160
But I don't really blame you,

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:22.160
because my Oshimarks don't work on YouTube.

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:25.160
So, we're going to do a quick tangent.

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:27.160
When I say quick, I mean 30 minutes.

01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.160
I was going to suggest that we pick

01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:34.160
some that are YouTube-friendly.

01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:37.160
I forgot to actually see that.

01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:39.160
I was going to suggest that we pick

01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:41.160
some that are YouTube-friendly.

01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:43.160
I forgot to actually see that.

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.160
Only 30?

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.160
That's optimistic!

01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:53.160
Slow your fucking roll, kid, okay?

01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:57.160
Don't disrespect me in my own households.

01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:00.160
I'm roping, but yeah.

01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:02.160
I know, mercies don't, like,

01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.160
mercies scissors don't work.

01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:09.160
Your vote is a snail in a tongue.

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:17.160
Yeah, I see, yeah, polar bear doesn't work.

01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:21.160
But, like, bear and ice cube make sense.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.160
That works.

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:24.160
Oh!

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:26.160
Since the bunny works,

01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:28.160
I will be bold and suggest the heal

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:30.160
and the other bunny.

01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:33.160
But the bunny doesn't work.

01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:39.160
Is it the bunny face?

01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:43.160
Because the bunny, like, body doesn't work.

01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:51.160
But, like, try to put the bunny,

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:52.160
because, like, you know,

01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:56.160
like, you look at my old videos,

01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:59.160
I had the rope in the bunny in my title.

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:00.160
I might have taken it out, actually.

01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:01.160
They don't show up.

01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:02.160
They just show up as squares.

01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:05.160
So I think the bunny head would work,

01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:07.160
and then the high-heeled shoe would work.

01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:12.160
The bunny twins in an act!

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:15.160
That's just the shining.

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:23.160
No, it was the, it was the,

01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:25.160
it's the bunny with the body

01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:26.160
and the rope.

01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:27.160
They both don't work.

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:28.160
Is it device to shoot?

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.160
No.

01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:34.160
Because that's,

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:36.160
the second one you posted, Nugget,

01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:38.160
isn't an emote, actually.

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:41.160
Like a, like a normal emote, I don't think.

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:47.160
Okay, here, let's, let's do this together.

01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:50.160
Well, put some in your fucking name,

01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:51.160
then we'll see.

01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:56.160
What a fitting game.

01:59:56.160 --> 01:59:57.160
All right.

01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:58.160
Now I have to pick them.

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.160
Damn, can you even test a working chat?

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:03.160
Yeah, it looks like, see, they're working chat.

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:06.160
But if you put them in your name, doesn't work.

02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:10.160
Oshimark can just be the membership icon.

02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:12.160
You mean the Gimp Bunny?

02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:13.160
I don't...

02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:20.160
No, but the, no, I want Oshimarks!

02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:21.160
I'm not settling!

02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:25.160
A bunny in vomit?

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:27.160
You fell for that.

02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:28.160
A bunny in a knife?

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:30.160
I'm not, no, I would say probably a heart

02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:32.160
in a knife for mercy.

02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:34.160
I'm gonna say

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.160
the gunny, if you will.

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:37.160
Is there, there's only a pistol.

02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:39.160
I wish, I wish they had like this water pistol.

02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:40.160
I wish they had the old gun back.

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:44.160
I use this account for normal stuff, though.

02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:46.160
Well, that's too fucking bad.

02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:51.160
I'm not changing my Oshimarks.

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.160
Like, this is the only specific to,

02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:55.160
actually, you know what?

02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:59.160
Until membership's open,

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.160
if you wanna show your support

02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.160
and show that you're a harem member,

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:05.160
you can put just the red high-heeled shoe in your name.

02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:07.160
So I don't think anybody uses that.

02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:10.160
I said, yeah, the red high-heeled shoe would be cool.

02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:13.160
Cause I think the red high-heeled shoe works.

02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:16.160
And then like some bunny doesn't even,

02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:17.160
that can just be anybody.

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:21.160
Yeah, yeah.

02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:28.160
Yeah, bunny head, red heel.

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:30.160
Pig.

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:34.160
Yeah, whatever fucking one works.

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:36.160
But just the red heel, definitely.

02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:38.160
Cause that one's obvious.

02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:41.160
Some bunny, what's told me?

02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:44.160
A rat?

02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:46.160
That would be more emmy.

02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:48.160
She got rats.

02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:53.160
Yeah, so you can do,

02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:56.160
you can do a heel in whatever your heart desires.

02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:57.160
What's an Oshimark?

02:01:58.160 --> 02:01:59.160
I like to explain it as,

02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:01.160
imagine it's a cutie mark.

02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:03.160
Of your favorite VTuber.

02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:04.160
But what's a cutie mark?

02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:06.160
It's a little symbol that shows aspects

02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:08.160
of the pony's personality.

02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:10.160
For example, Twilight Sparkle.

02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:12.160
She's purplish, like Twilight.

02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:14.160
And there's a sparkler in her name.

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:17.160
So it's like a purply sparkle on her punch.

02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:24.160
I've always said that Oshimarks are just cutie marks.

02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:25.160
Oshimarks.

02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:33.160
Did you put a red heel in a pregnant man?

02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:37.160
That was good.

02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:38.160
That was fucking good.

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.160
That got me.

02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:44.160
Mmm, some pop rocks to eat.

02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:50.160
I'm yum.

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.160
What are you looking at me like?

02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:58.160
What the fuck are you doing?

02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:02.160
Good night.

02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:06.160
No, there's this, I think there's a setting

02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:08.160
just to like put it in your name,

02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:09.160
like your display name.

02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:14.160
Only if you want to.

02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:22.160
Oh, look at you guys with your bunny heel.

02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:24.160
Ow, it makes me happy.

02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:28.160
Oh my God, that makes me so happy.

02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:32.160
I'll add it to my description.

02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:35.160
Like if you want to show your support,

02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:38.160
here are the YouTube Oshimarks.

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:40.160
And I'll just put like the bunny in the heel.

02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:42.160
Heal in a nose.

02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:46.160
Cool.

02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.160
My day is made.

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.160
Bro, I was so productive today.

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:52.160
I went to the doctor's office.

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:53.160
I paid some bills.

02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:55.160
I still haven't done my dishes.

02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:00.160
I picked up my mail and my packages.

02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:01.160
I'm streaming.

02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:04.160
I got lunch.

02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.160
I'm feeling good today.

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:11.160
I napped for 30 minutes.

02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:13.160
It was more like 15.

02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:15.160
These Pop Rocks are so fucking good.

02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:17.160
I'm adulting.

02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:20.160
Can you play the game now, please?

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:22.160
Can you please play the game?

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:23.160
Shabee.

02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:25.160
Shabee, you play the-

02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:26.160
Shut the fuck up.

02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:31.160
The big kids are talking, the big kids.

02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:32.160
The adults are talking.

02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:34.160
I just choked in a pop,

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:35.160
almost in a pop socket.

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.160
Pop Rock.

02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.160
Suck my left titties.

02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:40.160
Anyways.

02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:43.160
You don't need to keep looking at me like that.

02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.160
There's a cake.

02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:46.160
Pop Rocks are awful.

02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.160
Nobody asked.

02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:52.160
Did anyone ask?

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.160
What is that?

02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:54.160
Oh, nobody asked.

02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:55.160
That's crazy.

02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:56.160
Anyways.

02:04:58.160 --> 02:04:59.160
I'm more of a righty guy.

02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:04.160
You don't need to keep looking at me like that.

02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:06.160
I'm a righty guy.

02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:08.160
You don't need to keep looking at me like that.

02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:10.160
Oh, sorry.

02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:14.160
I wanted to remember your name and face, you see.

02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:17.160
So, well, I look like the other two guys in this place.

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:19.160
I'm just a black void.

02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:24.160
Yeah, I know, but you know.

02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:27.160
There's no need to worry.

02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:29.160
I've matched your face to your name now.

02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:30.160
But I look-

02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:31.160
I'm an unlockable character.

02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:33.160
Okay, it's my turn now.

02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:35.160
Oh, alright.

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:36.160
My name's Kana.

02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:38.160
I don't mind if you give me a nickname,

02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:40.160
but I sure you hope to-

02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:41.160
Yeah.

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.160
Alright.

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:44.160
I'll call you Conti.

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:46.160
Because you're a cunt.

02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:48.160
You talk to yourself a lot.

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:50.160
I'll do my best to match your name to your face then.

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:51.160
Kana-Chan.

02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:53.160
Yeah.

02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:56.160
Gonna come on her chin.

02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:57.160
What was that?

02:05:57.160 --> 02:05:58.160
Oh, sorry.

02:05:58.160 --> 02:05:59.160
Kana-Chan.

02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:01.160
Hey, stop it.

02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:03.160
You're making me all flustered.

02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:07.160
I- I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at.

02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:10.160
Well, you got massive fucking jugs.

02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:11.160
So...

02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:16.160
I suppose there's some things you learned from first-hand experience.

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:20.160
Yup, I guess I got a little smarter from this whole situation.

02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:22.160
What are you talking about?

02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:25.160
Well, tell me more about yourself, Haidoku.

02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:29.160
Ugh, I messed up real bad at work recently,

02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:32.160
and because of that, the boss fired me.

02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:34.160
So I've been assisting a friend at his-

02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:35.160
I wonder what he did for his job.

02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:37.160
Like, what did he fuck up?

02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:43.160
If you ever do a compilation of streams, this will definitely make it.

02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:47.160
An intrusive thoughts are waiting today.

02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:50.160
His nickname is longer than her real name.

02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:55.160
It's more like you're cleaning and not making more dirty dishes to clean dishes up.

02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:57.160
Yeah, it's because I had dishes in the dishwasher,

02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:59.160
I still need to take them out and put the other dishes away,

02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:01.160
and then put the new ones in the dishwasher.

02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:05.160
I stole someone's sandwich.

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:07.160
Probably forgot to use MLA format.

02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:08.160
That's what I'm going with.

02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:10.160
I need burp.

02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:15.160
My god.

02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:17.160
I really like the like-

02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:21.160
like the stuff coming from the ceiling that the-

02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:24.160
all the drinks are on, that's actually really fucking cool.

02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:26.160
Like the- the place in here is pretty sick.

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:28.160
Oh, that sounds rough.

02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:30.160
Anyways, wanna buy me another drink?

02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:34.160
If I was in your shoes, I probably wouldn't even be able to eat.

02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:36.160
You should just kill yourself.

02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:41.160
What?

02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:44.160
Uh, though, I- sorry, I meant to say, though I'm sure words

02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:46.160
can't express how awful you must feel.

02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.160
I'm so sorry.

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:50.160
Did you just tell me to kill me?

02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:51.160
No!

02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.160
Silly.

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.160
Alright, I- I got it.

02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:56.160
I'm going to do my absolute best

02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:58.160
in order for you to get back on your feet.

02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:00.160
What the fuck?

02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:02.160
Are you gonna do- are you gonna give me a job?

02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:06.160
The time you spend here will be-

02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:07.160
I'm- I'm gonna ignore that.

02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:09.160
The time you spend here will be a constant smile.

02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:11.160
I can assure you that much.

02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:14.160
I hope we get a long haitoku.

02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:17.160
Can you keep drinking haitoku?

02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:18.160
Don't push yourself, okay?

02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:21.160
I have like five other guys I need to hang out with.

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.160
And we're gonna get some burgers and fries later.

02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:30.160
I can't- should I keep talking to her?

02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:40.160
This game sucks, dude.

02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:48.160
No, no.

02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:50.160
No, no.

02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:52.160
That's funny.

02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:54.160
Okay.

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:57.160
Wow, is it already this late?

02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:58.160
I'll head back home.

02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:01.160
Jesus fuck.

02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:04.160
Thank you for today.

02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:05.160
See you soon.

02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:08.160
Yeah, thanks for everything.

02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:09.160
See you soon.

02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:13.160
Mom, Dad, I have a girlfriend.

02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:15.160
Yeah, she works at a hostess bar

02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:17.160
and her pay like 4500 yen to see her,

02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:19.160
but she's really sweet.

02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:20.160
She gives me greater life advice.

02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.160
I could talk to my cat for free.

02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:26.160
Save the Rizzing Brothers?

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:27.160
Okay, got you.

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:29.160
It was such a nice place

02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:30.160
and the customer service was great.

02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.160
Maybe I'll go there for the time being.

02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:38.160
I was sick.

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.160
Do I need- oh.

02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:46.160
Okay.

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:48.160
Cool.

02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:58.160
I can spend 6k yen on socks?

02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:06.160
Yeah, I'm buying girl socks

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:08.160
and then I'm gonna make her wear them

02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:10.160
and then give them back to me.

02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:13.160
Duh.

02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:19.160
I don't want to sniff her fucking socks.

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:24.160
Alright, what's the calendar?

02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:27.160
Make a girl out to dinner first.

02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:28.160
Oh!

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:31.160
Thank you, Ninka.

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:36.160
I love it.

02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:41.160
I have like really bad-

02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:43.160
because when I watch movies, I do this too.

02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:47.160
I really bad impulse like to say stupid shit

02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:50.160
during a movie or like a TV show that I'm watching

02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:55.160
and I do it a lot and I'm like-

02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:58.160
I remember thinking and like also when I play games

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:02.160
and then like seeing that people like did that on

02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:04.160
like for streamers and for YouTube,

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.160
I'm like why the fuck don't I become a streamer?

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:07.160
Like I do this on a daily.

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.160

02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:12.160
I stream to my cats.

02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.160
All of them.

02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:15.160
I can sleep.

02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:20.160
I can go on vacation.

02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:24.160
Does that- are we fucking on vacation?

02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:29.160
Why are there only three girls?

02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:33.160
Two of them look the same.

02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.160
They're dressed like they're-

02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:41.160
Bunny Power Rangers.

02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:42.160
I just-

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:43.160
Tyrannactyl!

02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:45.160
Tyrannosaurus!

02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:47.160
I never get the fucking blue one.

02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:50.160
Macedon!

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:51.160
Is it Macedon?

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:53.160
What time for-

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:54.160
Oh!

02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:55.160
Hi, Rhea.

02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:57.160
Hi, Mamosa.

02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:02.160
Oh, sorry.

02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:03.160
Triceratops!

02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:06.160
Yeah, the leaders from Pokemon Go.

02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:09.160
This one's me.

02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:12.160
Me with ponytails.

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:13.160
This one

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:16.160
is-

02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:19.160
None of the girls in our group look like that.

02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:21.160
This is Emmy because they have the same pigtails.

02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.160
No, I wouldn't-

02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:24.160
Never mind.

02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:25.160
That's not-

02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:27.160
None of these girls are us because

02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:29.160
I've been making some-

02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:30.160
If this was Emmy,

02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:32.160
I'd be making serious savers from really stupid shit.

02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:34.160
Although,

02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:36.160
Telling someone to kill themselves.

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:37.160
Telling someone to kill themselves.

02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:39.160
It's very on-gagged for her.

02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:41.160
How's it going?

02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:42.160
How was the stream?

02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:46.160
My sweet, sweet Yume Plus girls.

02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:48.160
My sweet girls.

02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:50.160
So, so cute.

02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:51.160
So silly.

02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.160
Guys, please check out Yume Plus and

02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:59.160
the girls because

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:00.160
they are-

02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:02.160
Mamosa is

02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:04.160
unhinged just like me.

02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:07.160
She's trying to give me her lotion tonic.

02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:08.160
See? There you go.

02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:15.160
They're such cute girls.

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:18.160
I'm honestly surprised they're not like

02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:21.160
fucking ginormous.

02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:23.160
They should be.

02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:24.160
I love watching their streams.

02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:26.160
They don't know, but I creep on their streams

02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:29.160
and I like to giggle at them a lot.

02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:31.160
I just lurk.

02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.160
Help!

02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:39.160
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching you.

02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.160
I'm watching you, Mamosa.

02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.160
I'm gonna drink you like a Mamosa.

02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:45.160
Okay, anyways, let's gamble.

02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:47.160
Gambling up to ten times.

02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:49.160
If I was a true gambler,

02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:50.160
I would have no limit.

02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:53.160
I'm leaving!

02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:56.160
Okay, I'm staying.

02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:59.160
Yeah, pull up a chair.

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.160
Pull up a chair, baby girl.

02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:03.160
Pull up a chair, baby girl.

02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.160
Come hang out in my bunny garden.

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.160
Yeah.

02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.160
Can we play Blackjack?

02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:17.160
What the hell is this?

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:21.160
Is this a Skull King from Inscription?

02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:23.160
Gambling!

02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:28.160
Wait!

02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:31.160
I don't even fucking play a game.

02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:33.160
I just lose money?

02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:37.160
Are you serious?

02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:40.160
I'm never fucking using this again.

02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:41.160
Why would I ever gamble?

02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:42.160
What is the point?

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:44.160
Now I have less money.

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:49.160
But like, I wish,

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:50.160
I thought there'd be like a cute mini game

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:51.160
where I play like Blackjack

02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.160
or like poker

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:54.160
or like fucking Solitaire.

02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:55.160
I don't know.

02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:57.160
What the hell, man?

02:14:57.160 --> 02:14:58.160
I've been cheated.

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:02.160
You can save Skum till you win.

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.160
No, I'm not going to do that.

02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:06.160
I was lost 20 bucks!

02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:09.160
Let's do it again.

02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:14.160
Can I like,

02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:15.160
can I just like, skip ahead?

02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:17.160
I don't care about this fucking splash screen.

02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:27.160
No!

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.160
No!

02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:41.160
No!

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.160
Alright, let's do it again.

02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:49.160
I just used 31k yet!

02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:52.160
Run it back!

02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:53.160
Run it back!

02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:55.160
Run me my, oh fuck, I lost again.

02:15:58.160 --> 02:15:59.160
Okay, no.

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:06.160
This sucks!

02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:11.160
Just skip, fuck, you guys are like,

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:12.160
I love this game!

02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:15.160
No, I don't!

02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:18.160
I feel like we're going to debt.

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:23.160
I remember I went to a casino with $50

02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:24.160
and I lost it all

02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:25.160
and I cried.

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:27.160
It was only $50.

02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:30.160
It wasn't even my $50.

02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.160
It was my, it was Olive's

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:34.160
because we were celebrating

02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:36.160
that she got a gig in an acting thing

02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.160
and she was with her friends to a casino.

02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:39.160
But I was like,

02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:40.160
I was just like broke

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:41.160
because like,

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:44.160
I had like a lot of health bills and shit

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:45.160
and so she was like,

02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:46.160
gave me 50 bucks

02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:47.160
and I was like,

02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:48.160
ah, yay!

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.160
And I was like,

02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:50.160
I'm going to flip this

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:51.160
and give you your 50 bucks back.

02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:52.160
I lost it.

02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:56.160
I will never gamble.

02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:58.160
That shit is terrible.

02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:04.160
Well, hello there.

02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:07.160
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:08.160
Yes.

02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:11.160
Thanks for visiting me today.

02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:13.160
I don't want to talk to you!

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:17.160
Can I talk to one of the other girls?

02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:22.160
Can I just buy you a drink?

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:24.160
Give me a gin and tonic.

02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:27.160
Yeah.

02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:29.160
Can I have some too?

02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:31.160
No bitch, I'm broke.

02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:32.160
Fine.

02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:34.160
I'll buy you some water

02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:35.160
with ice.

02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:36.160
How about that?

02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:38.160
You're getting less semi.

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:40.160
You're getting this whatever the fuck this is.

02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:42.160
Pay some music.

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:43.160
Okay.

02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:45.160
You don't have to relax, okay?

02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:46.160
Keep your panties on.

02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:48.160
Turn around.

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:50.160
Oh.

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:54.160
What?

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:57.160
Are you serious?

02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:03.160
If I don't buy, I swap girl?

02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:08.160
Damn.

02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:14.160
Well, I don't want to give my present to you.

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:15.160
Because I don't know why,

02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:16.160
but you kind of just bother me

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:19.160
and your boobs are like breathing.

02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:21.160
How does that even work?

02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:22.160
I'm breathing right now.

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.160
I'm looking down at my boobs.

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:26.160
My boobs don't separate

02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:29.160
and have breath in life of their own.

02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:39.160
This isn't working.

02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:40.160
Their boobs have lungs.

02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:41.160
You know, I don't breathe.

02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:47.160
She's got a bigger chest.

02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:48.160
My chest is as big as hers.

02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:50.160
I'm not even fucking joking.

02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:55.160
Her brain is there too.

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:56.160
When I go for a jog,

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.160
my tit punches me in the face.

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:00.160
Okay.

02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:02.160
Proof?

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.160
You want proof?

02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:05.160
Boom.

02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:07.160
There's your proof.

02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:10.160
There's your proof.

02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:12.160
Anyways.

02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:14.160
Cut the music!

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:15.160
Put it back on!

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:22.160
Uh, there's food?

02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:25.160
Aw.

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:28.160
I haven't eaten in a couple days.

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:31.160
Do you want some edamame?

02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:38.160
Huh? What's wrong?

02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:39.160
You seem puzzled.

02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:41.160
It just seems like you're a broke ass bitch

02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:42.160
and you only got edamame.

02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:43.160
So like,

02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:46.160
why couldn't you have gotten me like sushi or something?

02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:48.160
Huh?

02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:50.160
Got it!

02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:52.160
Haitaku!

02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:53.160
You're Haitaku!

02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:54.160
Wow!

02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:56.160
You forgot my name.

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:01.160
Yeah, so that's what you got.

02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:02.160
You forgot my name

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:04.160
and was trying desperately to remember it.

02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:05.160
That's not...

02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:06.160
I don't like you.

02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:07.160
I don't like you.

02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:09.160
I don't like you.

02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:11.160
Give me another girl.

02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:13.160
Customer service here sucks.

02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:16.160
Can I speak to your manager?

02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:17.160
Can I speak to your manager?

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:19.160
Bring me the manager.

02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:21.160
Bring me the fucking manager.

02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:26.160
I want to be a dick.

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:27.160
Can I be a dick and just say hi?

02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:28.160
I'm Kaido.

02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:30.160
No, because then she's just going to remember my name wrong.

02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:32.160
Well, I'm never going to talk to her again,

02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:33.160
so actually I'm Kaido.

02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:37.160
I was one letter off.

02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:39.160
I mean, sorry about that.

02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:40.160
Where are you giggling?

02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:42.160
Wait, you tricked me!

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:45.160
Anyways, dick, don't worry about me.

02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:47.160
I'll never forget your name anymore.

02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:48.160
So don't worry, okay?

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:49.160
Too late.

02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:51.160
I am wanting to talk to the girl in blue,

02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:53.160
so hurry up.

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:56.160
Thanks, but no thanks.

02:20:56.160 --> 02:20:58.160
I'm really sure it's hard for you to remember

02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:00.160
every customer's name like that.

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:01.160
Yeah.

02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:03.160
Guys kind of all look the same,

02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:04.160
like unlockable characters,

02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:06.160
and I wish you had name tags or something.

02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:07.160
You know, something cute,

02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:09.160
like what you see a kindergartner wearing.

02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:12.160
Sorry.

02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:14.160
I'm only joking, of course.

02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:15.160
I'm a lollicon.

02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:17.160
I'm a pro in my field.

02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:19.160
Remembering names is my specialty.

02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:25.160
Well, you did remember my name at the same time.

02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:28.160
Oh, I'm off, so you're still here.

02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.160
Hahaha!

02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:43.160
I'm actually being faceless fuck.

02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:49.160
Well, you did seem to remember my name

02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:50.160
within seconds before.

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:53.160
Seems like you're doing great for my eyes.

02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:55.160
Weird, you don't have any.

02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:56.160
Yeah, I know.

02:21:56.160 --> 02:21:58.160
Aw, thanks.

02:21:58.160 --> 02:21:59.160
You really are kind.

02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:01.160
Aren't you Haidokun?

02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:03.160
It's Kaido,

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:05.160
like the Vocaloid.

02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:07.160
I'll make sure to never forget your name.

02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:10.160
Haidokun, should I get more drinks?

02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:12.160
I want to keep talking to you more.

02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:16.160
That's a no for me, dog.

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:18.160
When did it get so late?

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:20.160
I guess I'll head back soon.

02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:26.160
Thank you for today.

02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:27.160
You're fucking broke.

02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:28.160
See you soon.

02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:29.160
You can't buy anything.

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:31.160
Yeah, thanks for everything.

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:32.160
See you soon.

02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:34.160
We're so poor.

02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:36.160
Can you get kicked out of Bunny Garden?

02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:37.160
That would actually be really funny.

02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:40.160
Yeah, I got paid!

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:42.160
Let's fucking go!

02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:43.160
I got paid!

02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:46.160
You know what time it is?

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:49.160
Let's fucking go!

02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:56.160
With eyes, only one eye is glowing.

02:22:58.160 --> 02:22:59.160
It's white.

02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:07.160
I'm buying you all drinks.

02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:09.160
The whole garden gets drinks!

02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:11.160
What do you want?

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:15.160
No.

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:24.160
We're so back, bros.

02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:25.160
So fucking back.

02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:27.160
So fucking back.

02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:30.160
90% of gamblers quit before hitting a big...

02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:32.160
Shut up.

02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:36.160
Thanks, boy!

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:42.160
I came up with a really bad joke.

02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:45.160
I'm going to say it anyways.

02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:47.160
So I'm going to need your mom to come over.

02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:49.160
And I'm going to trim her hedge.

02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:50.160
That's all I'm going to say.

02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:52.160
That's all I'm going to say.

02:23:58.160 --> 02:23:59.160
Wow.

02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:00.160
Games.

02:24:00.160 --> 02:24:01.160
So fun.

02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:05.160
Oh!

02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:09.160
Cast members may be away on Saturdays.

02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:10.160
Yes!

02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:12.160
Okay, what voice?

02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:13.160
What voice for her?

02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:15.160
What voice?

02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:16.160
She's kind of Gyaru.

02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:17.160
Should we give her a valley accent?

02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:21.160
After we plant the seed?

02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:22.160
Exactly.

02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:23.160
Exactly.

02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:24.160
This guy fucking gets it.

02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:26.160
Peppy?

02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:27.160
Peppy Valley girl?

02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:28.160
Okay.

02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:29.160
Hi!

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:30.160
What drink did you want?

02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:32.160
Uh, your hot as fuck.

02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:34.160
I'm going to get you something nice.

02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:35.160
I'm going to treat you.

02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:37.160
Sorry.

02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:38.160
It's like my keyboard.

02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:40.160
I just won big at gambling.

02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:44.160
So I'm going to have a buddy trap.

02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.160
Because I like traps.

02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:47.160
What was that?

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:48.160
Don't worry about it.

02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:52.160
Okay, whatever.

02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:54.160
Can I have some too?

02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:56.160
Yeah, I got you baby girl.

02:24:58.160 --> 02:24:59.160
I'm going to get you the bunny punch

02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:01.160
because I'm going to punch your fart box

02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:02.160
with my tongue later.

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.160
Huh?

02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:04.160
Don't worry about it.

02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:06.160
I'm sorry.

02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:08.160
I thought you were going to get it.

02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:09.160
You wanted to play hide and seek.

02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:10.160
I'm sorry.

02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:25.160
I'm sorry.

02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:26.160
I'm sorry.

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:28.160
I am sorry.

02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:29.160
I'm sorry.

02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:30.160
I'm sorry.

02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:31.160
I'm sorry.

02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:32.160
I'm sorry.

02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:54.800
I want to tongue punch your fart box.

02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:55.800
Man.

02:25:55.800 --> 02:26:03.240
Cause I'm gonna just like make clips of just this one, this one, uh, stream, I'm just like

02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:14.760
all the dumb ass shit I'm saying, uh, hold on, take a sip.

02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:22.640
I was in your tea, it's literally only chamomile in mint, in lavender, I'm eating, I'm drinking

02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:28.000
the sleepy time tea, uh, that you lovely bitches got me off the throne, thank you so much, it's

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000
my favorite tea.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.920
Usually I take it to fall asleep, but I don't feel like taking the throat coat for my throat,

02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:36.600
cause I've been talking this entire week, and last week.

02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:38.240
So I'm drinking this instead, it's very tasty.

02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:39.240
It's not caffeinated.

02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:40.240
How am I holding up?

02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:41.240
I'm holding up good.

02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:42.240
I'm having a great time.

02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:43.240
I can take a shot.

02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:44.240
You guys want me, should we take a shot?

02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:45.240
You guys want to take a shot?

02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:46.240
You guys want to take a shot?

02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:47.240
I got Tito's.

02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:54.920
Should we get a lady titi?

02:26:54.920 --> 02:27:01.540
Should we make this a drunk stream?

02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:02.540
Sounds good.

02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:04.400
Take a shot, take a shot.

02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:06.680
Part in the jar, what?

02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:10.280
Just shot of Tito's.

02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:13.080
I don't have a lime to chase it though.

02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:16.400
Let's do it, let's fucking do it.

02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:18.120
Oh my god, Rina, I was rolled over you.

02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:20.320
Hi, what's up?

02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:21.160
Can I help you?

02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:23.720
Hey.

02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:25.480
Oh, what's up?

02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:28.440
Hey, mamas, how you doing?

02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:30.220
Why are you wet?

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:32.960
Her chest is wet,

02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:34.800
cause she sometimes like sticks her whole entire

02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:36.960
fucking body into the water bowl.

02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:37.960
A water fountain.

02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:42.600
Here, you want some cat purrs?

02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:44.440
Hold on, let me switch off the desktop audio

02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:45.840
so you can hear her purring.

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:48.480
Cat purrs and shots?

02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:04.280
Yeah, she's my big mama.

02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:07.560
You trying to stop me from taking a shot?

02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:09.280
Cause you're not gonna, Rina.

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:12.600
Anyways, let me just get up and be in worse fear.

02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:17.600
I just thought of that side talk.

02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:22.080
Do you remember like the big gong guy,

02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:24.480
like the same side talk guys?

02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:26.680
I just think of that fucking,

02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:28.240
the black dude on the street,

02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:29.880
is like talking to a homeless chick.

02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:31.280
He's like, you want a shot?

02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:32.240
You want a shot?

02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:33.080
You want a shot?

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:36.720
I fucking love that clip.

02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:37.720
So funny, buddy.

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:40.040
Oh my god.

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:44.040
Wow, do I have a shot glass?

02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:48.280
I only got a little bit of...

02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:59.160
We drinking straight from the bottle, bros.

02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:01.680
Cause I don't throw in my shot glass one.

02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:04.520
You want a shot?

02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:05.440
You want a shot?

02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:08.880
Drink from my Oshie mark, like my shoe?

02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:13.480
Can you guess what it is?

02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:14.760
Just Tito's vodka.

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:18.680
80 proof, 40% alcohol.

02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:27.480
Oh dear lord heaven, we are so Barak Obama.

02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:28.680
Hello, Barak Obama.

02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:31.520
You want a shot?

02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:32.360
You want a shot?

02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:34.720
I want you to look up that clip right now

02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:37.400
and picture me saying that to you.

02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:41.040
And that, you know, like that,

02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:45.560
that like Pennywise the clown,

02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:48.400
when he takes a, he's about to take a drink of something

02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:50.240
and he just like flicks the cap off.

02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:52.440
I can't do it.

02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:53.560
Oh, perfect.

02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:55.360
Oh shit, I dropped it.

02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:56.320
And then he just swigs it.

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:57.600
That's what I'm gonna do.

02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:01.760
Woo!

02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:11.640
Oh my God, that tingled my fucking nipples.

02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:12.720
What the fuck?

02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:15.720
You want a shot?

02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:16.880
You want a shot?

02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:20.160
Oh, I need a moment.

02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:27.520
Fuck yeah!

02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:32.120
Oh, aren't you funny?

02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:32.960
Oh, aren't you funny?

02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:34.280
Charlie spurred it $4.20.

02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:35.400
Thank you, Charlie.

02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:38.120
Madam, I offer all my worldly possessions

02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:39.520
to you smiling face.

02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:44.600
All right, can I have your clothes?

02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:45.440
Give me your shoes.

02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:46.280
I like your shoes.

02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:47.400
Are we the same size?

02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:48.240
Yeah, I'll take those two.

02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:49.080
Thank you.

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:49.920
Appreciate it.

02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:50.760
Thank you, Charlie.

02:30:56.920 --> 02:31:00.560
Ooh, I'm gonna sleep well tonight.

02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:07.640
You want a shot?

02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:08.960
You want a shot?

02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:09.960
You want a shot?

02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:10.960
You want a shot?

02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:16.960
Pew, pew!

02:31:16.960 --> 02:31:17.960
Pew, pew!

02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:18.960
Pew, pew!

02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:21.960
Oh, that was a Tito's burp.

02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:27.400
I need your clothes in return.

02:31:27.400 --> 02:31:28.240
No.

02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:31.160
I own you.

02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:33.640
I own you, okay?

02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:34.640
In your mouth.

02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:38.040
I'm almost, I fucking love you.

02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:40.120
I'm almost a reveal bunch.

02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:41.440
Match up my energy right now.

02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:47.040
That's what I was referencing.

02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:48.280
I was referencing PsyTalk.

02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:53.320
You can't pull out the gun every time you drink.

02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:55.080
Who fucking said I can't?

02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:57.920
I do what I want, when I want it.

02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:00.600
I'm now eating applesauce.

02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:04.600
Me eating a bogey squeeze.

02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:09.160
If you're gonna drink with me,

02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:11.200
make sure you hydrate and eat something.

02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:17.400
This is America.

02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:18.560
Don't get you stripping.

02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:20.840
Stripping, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:25.080
I'm so happy because today I discovered

02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:27.240
when I was listening to the new Caitranada album

02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:30.040
that challenged Gambino and Caitranada

02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:31.760
made a fucking song together

02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:33.800
and I literally was praying

02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:36.840
to the gods above in the universe for that

02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:39.040
and it happened and it was great.

02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:40.360
And then they did a pink pantherist

02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:41.880
and I was like, holy fucking shit.

02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:47.240
PsyTalk vid.

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:49.960
Hmm.

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:50.800
Probably.

02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:52.640
Baby a triple.

02:32:52.640 --> 02:32:56.120
Anonymous tipped $3.33.

02:32:56.120 --> 02:32:58.880
He said face red heart shape.

02:32:58.880 --> 02:32:59.720
Bebe.

02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:03.760
I think probably.

02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:06.120
Okay, no, pray for me to be debt free.

02:33:06.120 --> 02:33:07.360
Pray, I'll pray for all of us.

02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:08.200
I'm praying.

02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:11.600
Oh universe.

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:15.120
Oh, God's above, please let us all be debt free.

02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:18.280
Please let us all win the lottery.

02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:19.120
Thank you.

02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:21.680
Inshallah.

02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:23.520
God willing.

02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:26.480
I fucking love pink panthers.

02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:27.920
Amen.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.880
And so it shall be.

02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:32.040
And so it might be.

02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:36.880
I forget the Hebrew way to say amen.

02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:38.480
Or is that, is amen already Hebrew?

02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:39.480
I don't fucking know.

02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:42.480
That is a prison and gambling is the key.

02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:43.480
Time to gamble.

02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:47.040
Pray that taxes are abolished.

02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:47.880
No taxes.

02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:49.240
Actually, no, tax are rich.

02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:53.440
All right, take another swig.

02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:54.280
Hold on.

02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:56.640
Any music, any music, any music,

02:33:56.640 --> 02:33:58.240
any music for a second.

02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:01.840
I mean, I don't know.

02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:04.840
Sorry, I'm gonna be a 12-kiss for a second.

02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:13.840
I get claimed, but I only do a couple seconds.

02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:18.840
I'm doing it from my phone.

02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:21.940
I'm doing it from my phone.

02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:29.400
AHHHHHH!!

02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:31.400
AHHHHHHHH!!

02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:37.400
UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH!

02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:39.400
We're the capitol.

02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:42.400
Mmm.

02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:44.400
Hold on.

02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:47.400
Wait, no!

02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:55.840
Okay, we're good.

02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:04.840
Howdy mate, how's it going?

02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:06.840
How you doing?

02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:07.840
Stop!

02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:10.840
I can't find the cat.

02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:11.840
No cat.

02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:16.840
Go away, girl, go!

02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:21.840
I'm scared, did you just...

02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:22.840
What the fuck, what do you mean?

02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:25.840
What the fuck is going on?

02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:26.840
What?

02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:27.840
What?

02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:35.840
Okay, I took two swigs of my Tito's.

02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:38.840
I am feeling a whore.

02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:39.840
Here's a present.

02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:41.840
I just met you, but this is crazy.

02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:42.840
Here's some socks.

02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:45.840
So wear them, maybe.

02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:48.840
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:50.840
I just want you to like it.

02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:53.840
Please wear them.

02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:57.840
I'm gonna buy one to wear next.

02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:00.840
I got something good.

02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:01.840
Wait, hold on.

02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:06.840
Wait a sec, you're pretty cute, but why are you curled up in a ball, sir?

02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:11.840
How the fuck am I curled up in a ball at the counter, but okay.

02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:12.840
What's wrong?

02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:14.840
You must be nervous.

02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:15.840
That's no good.

02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:18.840
Getting nervous over me is just a waste of energy.

02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:21.840
Oh, hello, my name is Hito Kanda.

02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:23.840
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:25.840
That's disgusting.

02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:27.840
Don't burp in my face again.

02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:30.840
You started introducing yourself, you fucking weirdo.

02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:33.840
Well then, I will too.

02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:35.840
Hello, I am Rin.

02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:36.840
Sorry to trouble you.

02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:37.840
What am I doing?

02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:39.840
Is this how it's supposed to go?

02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:43.840
So, what do you do?

02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:44.840
Hi Chan.

02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:47.840
Do you call me how she calls me Chan?

02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:53.840
Well, right now I'm assisting an acquaintance with their job.

02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:56.840
But until recently...

02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:58.840
Thank you, Charlie.

02:36:58.840 --> 02:36:59.840
Thank you, Charlie.

02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:01.840
It's too late.

02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:03.840
I wear an eye patch.

02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:06.840
IRL and my medical bills are astronomical.

02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:10.840
I think the prayer is too late.

02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:12.840
Jesus fuck.

02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:14.840
I'm sorry.

02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:19.840
I hope that can be recovered for you.

02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.840
So fuck.

02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:28.840
Uh...

02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:30.840
Yeah, stop.

02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:33.840
There are even tags on your pyres, bro.

02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:36.840
You're so fucking out of poker for that.

02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:39.840
Honestly, eye patches are badass, though.

02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:45.840
There's this one governor, I think, in America that was a former military veteran.

02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:47.840
He wears an eye patch and he looks fucking cool.

02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:49.840
And you can pretend you're solid snakes sometimes.

02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:52.840
So...

02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:54.840
That's good. I hope it goes well.

02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:56.840
Thank you for the tip.

02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:58.840
I need to scratch my nose.

02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:01.840
But until recently, I was employed at a company.

02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:05.840
However, due to a plethora of mistakes, I was terminated.

02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:08.840
Is there even a word for plethora in Japanese?

02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:10.840
Hang on. Hi, Tom.

02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:14.840
I can't keep up with all that formal speech. Stop being a fucking weirdo.

02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:18.840
I'd be super grateful if you could just, like, talk normally, please.

02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:20.840
Like, what is this?

02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:22.840
I'm moving my hands around. You can't tell.

02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:25.840
Yes, it's called plethora.

02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:28.840
Oh, really? I'll drop the pretenses then.

02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:31.840
Thank you. You're such a nice guy, hi, Tom.

02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:35.840
Even if you're too formal and weird sometimes, it's their loss for firing you.

02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:37.840
You're better off without them.

02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:40.840
No, they treated me pretty well.

02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:42.840
But I'm kidding, bye, okay now.

02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:45.840
I gambled the other day and I did well.

02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:48.840
Wow, you're really something, hi, Tom.

02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:51.840
You don't badmouth them even after getting fired.

02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:54.840
I respect that. You know, you're for real, for real.

02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:58.840
No cap. Facts, no printer, ink.

02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:00.840
What the fuck did you just say?

02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:03.840
You're a stand-up guy. You must get that a lot, huh?

02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:09.840
I don't get that at all.

02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:12.840
They do. Let me hear some more.

02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:14.840
Let me hear some more.

02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:16.840
Can you feed my ego?

02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:18.840
Can you feed my ego, please?

02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:22.840
You're such a kind, upstanding person, hi, Chen.

02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:26.840
It's true. I just met you. We've only talked once.

02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:29.840
You're really kind of fucking weird, but sure.

02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:33.840
You know, you're so kind and upstanding.

02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:35.840
I already said that.

02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:37.840
You already said that.

02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:40.840
Yeah, but you're kind and upstanding, okay?

02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:42.840
Oh, hey, let me tell you something.

02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:47.840
I'm serious. Well, I'm always serious, but I'm seriously, serious.

02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:50.840
Are you okay?

02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:53.840
A new people is really important, right? In life, I mean.

02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:57.840
Online, you know.

02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:00.840
So I'm really grateful to have met you, hi, Chen.

02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:05.840
I may be far from perfect, but I'll still do the very best I can.

02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:08.840
Hope you're ready. I'm gonna sit on your face.

02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:10.840
So what?

02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:13.840
Um, sorry, I didn't mean to say that. Ellipses.

02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:16.840
How embarrassing. What am I saying?

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:19.840
Sit on your face. That was so forward of me.

02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:22.840
Well, you get the idea. Did you catch all that?

02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:25.840
I'm not saying it again. I'm gonna sit on your face.

02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:28.840
By the way, the other girls here will also sit on your face,

02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:32.840
and they're really nice too. I think you'll like this shop a lot.

02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:37.840
If you find that I'm not your type after talking to me a few times,

02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:40.840
feel free to slide up to the next row and sit,

02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:43.840
or you can have us both at once.

02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:49.840
I'm not the type of girl who's bothered by that sort of thing to be, you know,

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:53.840
with another girl and a guy. I'm bi, you know.

02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:57.840
I'm pretty fluid. I don't believe in labels, actually.

02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:00.840
Uh, can you, can we change the subject?

02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:04.840
Fine. Well, on the other hand, if you do find that I'm your type,

02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:07.840
it'd make me pretty happy.

02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:09.840
Well, I'll leave it at that.

02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:13.840
So, like, do you want to have a threesome or...?

02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:17.840
I didn't pay for that kind of service.

02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:20.840
It's on the house. Just say fucking yes.

02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:23.840
I don't think I'm comfortable with that.

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:25.840
Sorry.

02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:30.840
Um, anyways, I look forward to serving you or whatever, I guess.

02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:35.840
Don't fucking threesome with me and the girl in the blue fucking bitch.

02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:38.840
Bet you watch his worst head tie.

02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:39.840
What did you say?

02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:44.840
I can! How about drinks? Do you want a bit more? Should I get you something?

02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:46.840
Uh, no, I'm good.

02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:48.840
When did it get so late?

02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:50.840
I should head back soon.

02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:02.840
I don't know.

02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:07.840
If you can please the cast members in the shop.

02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:10.840
I'm gonna leave my eyebrows.

02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:13.840
They'll see you out in a good mood when you leave.

02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:17.840
Haito, who is sent off, is more motivated to work and had...

02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:19.840
What the fuck?

02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:24.840
Thank you for today! See you soon!

02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:26.840
Yeah, thank you for today.

02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:30.840
So, about that threesome, so I'm meeting the other girl, like, in like an hour?

02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.840
Did you want to, like...

02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:35.840
I gotta get home. I have work tomorrow.

02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:36.840
But it's Sunday.

02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:38.840
Uh, yeah.

02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:39.840
Over time.

02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:41.840
Later.

02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:48.840
I don't know if you guys heard her meow.

02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:50.840
She went, meow.

02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:52.840
She's in my lap.

02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:00.840
I got to drink some delicious alcohol and have fun conversations.

02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:02.840
Now I'm motivated for work.

02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:10.840
Um...

02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:18.840
Okay, I don't know what the fuck that is.

02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:20.840
Let's buy another thing.

02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:27.840
I'm gonna buy some macarons for the blue black-haired girl.

02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:38.840
Now's my time to rest up and recover.

02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:41.840
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:46.840
Oh, fuck, it's this bitch again.

02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:49.840
What? Oh, you came! Thanks!

02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:50.840
I...

02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:52.840
Clean up after yourself next time.

02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:54.840
That's all I'm gonna say.

02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:56.840
Um, what drink did you want?

02:43:57.840 --> 02:43:59.840
I don't want to hang out with you.

02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:01.840
Can I, like...

02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:03.840
Not buy anything?

02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:05.840
Cause I don't want to talk to you.

02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:07.840
I'm gonna get a blueberry liquor.

02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:09.840
Cause that sounds tasty.

02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:13.840
Can I have some too? No bitch.

02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:15.840
I want to talk to the girl in blue.

02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:21.840
A customer called me so I better get going.

02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:23.840
No one else is fucking here.

02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:26.840
I get it, you're embarrassed.

02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:28.840
I want to talk to the blue girl.

02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:31.840
Can I...

02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:33.840
She just fucking walked in place.

02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:35.840
I don't want to talk to you either!

02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:37.840
Let me talk to her!

02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:43.840
Okay, I'll just get some food.

02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:48.840
Damn.

02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:50.840
This makes me hungry.

02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:52.840
I need to eat dinner.

02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:00.840
What is a geo?

02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:01.840
Ailo?

02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:03.840
A jello?

02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:13.840
You want some cheese and crackers?

02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:15.840
You want some salami?

02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:17.840
I can give you a hard salami.

02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:19.840
Um...

02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:21.840
Uh, like, no thanks.

02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:22.840
Alright, fine.

02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:24.840
I guess we'll just be french fries.

02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:29.840
Thank God, this tastes so good!

02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:32.840
I'm glad you came back, thinkies!

02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:34.840
Have you been good?

02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:37.840
Yeah, you seem like you're in a good mood too, ranchon.

02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:39.840
How do you know my name?

02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:41.840
I don't... oh no, she did introduce herself, nevermind.

02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:43.840
Girl dinner.

02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:46.840
When do you get the sushi off of her?

02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:48.840
Ooh, so like...

02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:51.840
Is there gonna be an option on the menu where I can eat sushi off your body?

02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:53.840
Sorry, I hit the microphone.

02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:56.840
Um, we don't do that store to service here.

02:45:56.840 --> 02:45:58.840
This place fucking blows!

02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:01.840
Where's my happy ending?

02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:04.840
What good would I be if I couldn't put on a smile?

02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:06.840
I'm ignoring that.

02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:07.840
Hmm?

02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:09.840
Yeah, my neighbors are walking by.

02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:12.840
You actually don't look like you're feeling so great yourself.

02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:14.840
Really?

02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:16.840
I'm feeling fine physically today.

02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:18.840
And I don't have any problems.

02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:20.840
Hmm, you look shitty.

02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:21.840
That's all I'm gonna say, buddy.

02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:23.840
Did you shower?

02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:25.840
You smell like you haven't showered.

02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:26.840
You sure?

02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:28.840
Nope, but you're definitely not feeling good.

02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:30.840
Not at all.

02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:33.840
This is a bad omen, you know.

02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:34.840
Get it?

02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:36.840
Today's fortune?

02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:39.840
You know what would make the bad omen go away?

02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:42.840
If you buy me a better drink.

02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:45.840
Or some sushi.

02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:49.840
Or if you have that threesome I keep talking to you about, you know, I never mind you smell bad.

02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:52.840
Me and girl in blue don't wanna fuck you anyways.

02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:58.840
When does this should be real-time phantom stream?

02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:00.840
See?

02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:04.840
Japanese honorifics and the F-boy voice is so good.

02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:06.840
Can I start saying thankies?

02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:08.840
Oh my god, thankies!

02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:12.840
But hey sir, you're lucky.

02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:14.840
In fact, I can judge based on your name.

02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:15.840
Wanna try?

02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:19.840
Oh fuck, you're one of those numerology astrology bitches.

02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:20.840
Fuck, crazy bitch.

02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:21.840
What?

02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:23.840
Nothing, sure.

02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:26.840
Like, fortune telling with names?

02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:29.840
Sure, I'll give it a try.

02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:31.840
Okay, okay, I know your name already.

02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:34.840
You told me what it was last time, right?

02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:40.840
Did you forget my fucking name and you're just stalling for me to say it?

02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:43.840
Yeah, I introduce myself to you.

02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.840
Right, I know it, I know it, I know it, but I need to know how it's spelled.

02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:50.840
Let's see the fortune telling.

02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:52.840
You are so full of shit.

02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:54.840
No, I'm not.

02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:56.840
I pooped this morning.

02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:00.840
How do you spell your name in kanji?

02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:06.840
I am haito, it's kan-

02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:08.840
Why would I just say my last name?

02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:10.840
Why would I say my filming name?

02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:13.840
I could be an ass and say it's spelled in hiragana.

02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:18.840
I'll tease her.

02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:21.840
I want my birth chart.

02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:24.840
Like, I don't want a free threesome bra.

02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:27.840
I'm like uber uncomfortable with that.

02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:30.840
Oh, like, I don't want a threesome bra.

02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:32.840
I'm like uber uncomfortable with that.

02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:35.840
I only do threesome with my bros.

02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:37.840
I feel tower.

02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:39.840
Each other.

02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:40.840
Huh?

02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:41.840
Nothing.

02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:43.840
It's kanda.

02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:48.840
Right, but what I want to know is your first name.

02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:52.840
I don't think I called you by your first name last time.

02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:56.840
You literally gave me a female honorific because you're a bitch.

02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:00.840
First, the character is for cup in person, then dry in field.

02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:02.840
That's how you spell haito kanda.

02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:04.840
Remember now?

02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:06.840
You got me, huh?

02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:08.840
I totally forgot your name.

02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:10.840
I'm really sorry.

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:13.840
Okay, I found a way online.

02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:14.840
I'm one of those.

02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:18.840
Oh my god, witch talk is so helpful to learn someone's name after you forget it.

02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:21.840
It's said to offer to tell their fortune with it.

02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:22.840
Clever, huh?

02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:24.840
But how did you figure it out?

02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:29.840
Was it acting suspicious?

02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:32.840
These girls are annoying me.

02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:36.840
You seem like the type of person who can't tell a lie, French Anne,

02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:39.840
but you kind of just technically lied by a mission.

02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:42.840
It was written all your face how you were acting.

02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:43.840
I get it.

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:47.840
People usually tell me they can read me like an open book.

02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:49.840
I live honestly.

02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:52.840
It's so tiring to cover up stuff with lies.

02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:57.840
It's easier just to be honest and then apologize when you get scolded.

02:49:57.840 --> 02:49:58.840
I'm sorry.

02:49:58.840 --> 02:49:59.840
Hi, Chan.

02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:01.840
You told me your name, but I forgot it.

02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:03.840
And then I tried to pull the wool over your eyes.

02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:05.840
I'm really sorry.

02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:10.840
So what are you going to do to make up for it?

02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:13.840
What do you mean?

02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:15.840
I'd like my happy ending, please.

02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:18.840
I'd like to order one happy ending.

02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:20.840
Get on your knees.

02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:21.840
Come on.

02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:22.840
No, I can't.

02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:24.840
We're at work.

02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:27.840
I'm asking politely.

02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:29.840
I know where you live.

02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:30.840
Okay.

02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:33.840
Can I do it later?

02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:34.840
Fine.

02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:37.840
Sorry, I got...

02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:52.840
I'm sorry.

02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:54.840
I forgot where I was.

02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:56.840
Hido just took over me.

02:50:56.840 --> 02:50:59.840
I don't even...

02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:00.840
This va...

02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:02.840
Why would the va be dead?

02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:04.840
Well, aren't you funny?

02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:06.840
Thank you, Anonymous.

02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:07.840
Appreciate you.

02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:08.840
Man, that's crazy.

02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:10.840
Even more money for the lovely Madden Sheehan.

02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:14.840
Man, that's crazy.

02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:15.840
You want the type ending?

02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:16.840
I don't know.

02:51:16.840 --> 02:51:18.840
I know what it is.

02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:19.840
I don't think it was Hido.

02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:26.840
I said hi to.

02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:30.840
I never thought I wanted to be in top of this game, but here we are.

02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:32.840
I can't tell if it's from the game or what it is.

02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:35.840
I'm probably not actually watching.

02:51:35.840 --> 02:51:36.840
Stalker is.

02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:40.840
I learned from Mercy.

02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:44.840
Make myself a little bit bigger.

02:51:44.840 --> 02:51:47.840
There we go.

02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:48.840
Block that girl's ass.

02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:49.840
You guys can't see.

02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:53.840
Only I can see.

02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:54.840
I scare you?

02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:55.840
It's good.

02:51:55.840 --> 02:51:57.840
You should be scared.

02:51:57.840 --> 02:51:58.840
It's all right.

02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:00.840
She didn't bother me at all.

02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:01.840
For real?

02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:02.840
Yay.

02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:09.840
Well, then let's get back and have some fun.

02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:13.840
So lay back.

02:52:13.840 --> 02:52:17.840
I'll find all and butt in your pants for you.

02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:20.840
Wow.

02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:22.840
That's really small.

02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:24.840
Hey, I'm just.

02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:25.840
It's just.

02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:27.840
I'm not worked up yet.

02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:28.840
Okay.

02:52:28.840 --> 02:52:33.840
All right, well.

02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:38.840
Here it goes.

02:52:38.840 --> 02:52:48.840
It's cold in here.

02:52:48.840 --> 02:52:54.840
Sir, it's heated to 73 degrees in here.

02:52:54.840 --> 02:52:56.840
You're sweating.

02:52:56.840 --> 02:53:01.840
Yeah, I will.

02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:03.840
That's really pathetic.

02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:04.840
All right.

02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:08.840
Fuck you.

02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:11.840
I'm just gonna fuck it.

02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:17.840
Well, I'll go extra hard today to make up for my screw up with your names.

02:53:17.840 --> 02:53:20.840
I won't insult you anymore.

02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:21.840
You're still drinking.

02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:23.840
Hi, Chan.

02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:24.840
Drinking to forget.

02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:26.840
Careful not to overdo it.

02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:27.840
Okay.

02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:29.840
Please, someone get this guy out of here.

02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:32.840
His dick is so small.

02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:34.840
I'm leaving.

02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:35.840
Wow.

02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:36.840
It's already this way.

02:53:36.840 --> 02:53:37.840
Wipes tears from face.

02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:38.840
Oh, are you?

02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:39.840
I'm at home.

02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:41.840
Charlie spur tipped four dollars and 20 cents.

02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:42.840
Thank you again, Charlie.

02:53:42.840 --> 02:53:43.840
No, it's average sized.

02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:44.840
I swear.

02:53:44.840 --> 02:53:46.840
Don't make fun of me, madam.

02:53:46.840 --> 02:53:49.840
Loudly crying.

02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:53.840
Why are you guys so tiny?

02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:59.840
How is anybody supposed to work with that?

02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:05.840
I'll head back home.

02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:08.840
Bigger when you pull on it.

02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:10.840
Thank you for today.

02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:12.840
I have to brush my teeth.

02:54:12.840 --> 02:54:13.840
Taste it like cigarettes.

02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:16.840
See you soon.

02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:17.840
Yeah.

02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:19.840
Thanks for everything.

02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:21.840
Didn't even get to come.

02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:30.840
See you soon.

02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:33.840
Oh, fuck.

02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:38.840
Oh, you know what this means.

02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:40.840
I wish this had more banger music.

02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:54.840
Oh, banger music, guys.

02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:55.840
Okay.

02:54:55.840 --> 02:54:57.840
Sometimes the eyes glow and sometimes they don't.

02:54:57.840 --> 02:54:59.840
When it's red, it means I lost.

02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:00.840
Oh, fuck.

02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:02.840
We're going to do it again.

02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:04.840
We got money to spend.

02:55:04.840 --> 02:55:06.840
Oh, when it glows one eye, we win.

02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:07.840
I'm pretty sure.

02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:11.840
It turns white or not.

02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:14.840
It does not.

02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:15.840
Oh, I did win.

02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:17.840
Yeah.

02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:21.840
Let's do it again.

02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:24.840
Something more impressive when you measure in millimeters.

02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:26.840
I lost again.

02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:28.840
Oh, baby.

02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:29.840
Oh, baby.

02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:30.840
A triple.

02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:32.840
$3.33.

02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:33.840
Thank you.

02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:34.840
Just a tip.

02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:35.840
Thank you for the tip.

02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:37.840
Thank you for the tip.

02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:40.840
I lost again.

02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:42.840
God damn it.

02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:46.840
I won.

02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:47.840
I didn't win that much though.

02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:48.840
Okay.

02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:53.840
If you get the one red glowing eye and white screen, you win big.

02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:58.840
But if you just get a no glowing eyes and white screen, you kind of win a little bit.

02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:02.840
But if you get two glowing red eyes, you lost badly.

02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:11.840
And if you get no glowing red eyes, you lost a small amount.

02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:12.840
One red glowing eye.

02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:13.840
It's lost like a medium amount.

02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:14.840
Okay.

02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:16.840
Oh, baby.

02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:20.840
A triple.

02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:23.840
It should be just like me when the high energy drinks longer does it.

02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:24.840
Oh my God.

02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:29.840
I need to feel alive.

02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:30.840
I know.

02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:31.840
I need to gain the system.

02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:32.840
Fuck that.

02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:34.840
We're not gaming the system.

02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:36.840
I didn't read that.

02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:38.840
It's fine.

02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.840
No, I want to talk to the blue girl.

02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:46.840
Get these bitches out of my face.

02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:47.840
Oh, you came.

02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:48.840
I'm glad.

02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:51.840
I have to change my outfit now.

02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:56.840
What drink did you want?

02:56:56.840 --> 02:56:59.840
What are you buying?

02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:00.840
What are you selling?

02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:04.840
I'm feeling crazy.

02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:06.840
Can I have some too?

02:57:06.840 --> 02:57:09.840
Are we splitting it?

02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:10.840
Fine.

02:57:10.840 --> 02:57:11.840
I'll get you.

02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:17.840
I'll get you a highball.

02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:18.840
It tastes amazing.

02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:23.840
I love this.

02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:26.840
Are you wearing the same panties?

02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:28.840
Girl, change your underwear.

02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:35.840
I'll give you the macarons, I guess.

02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:38.840
Here you go.

02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:41.840
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:44.840
I swear I didn't put razors in them.

02:57:44.840 --> 02:57:46.840
I swear.

02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:47.840
Just don't look.

02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:49.840
Just close your eyes when you eat them.

02:57:49.840 --> 02:57:51.840
I hope you like it.

02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:53.840
Wow, thanks.

02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:55.840
I'll take care of...

02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:13.840
How'd those get in there?

02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:17.840
Why did you put razors in this?

02:58:17.840 --> 02:58:18.840
You good?

02:58:18.840 --> 02:58:20.840
Did nobody get my bit?

02:58:20.840 --> 02:58:22.840
They weren't paying attention.

02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:23.840
You seem happy.

02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:25.840
Did something happen?

02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:28.840
Did you guys think I actually hurt myself?

02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:30.840
Well, you came all this way to...

02:58:30.840 --> 02:58:31.840
Oh, sorry.

02:58:31.840 --> 02:58:33.840
Frog in my throat.

02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:35.840
Well, you came all this way to visit me.

02:58:35.840 --> 02:58:37.840
Of course I'm happy.

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:41.840
Thanks, but you seem much happier than usual.

02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:42.840
I'm not.

02:58:42.840 --> 02:58:47.840
I just swallowed a razor, but we have medical concerns, so I'll be okay.

02:58:47.840 --> 02:58:53.840
Maybe it's because I really got some time to relax during my time off recently.

02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:57.840
You used your days off to the fullest, then.

02:58:57.840 --> 02:59:00.840
Did you go shopping?

02:59:00.840 --> 02:59:03.840
I mostly shop online these days.

02:59:03.840 --> 02:59:09.840
I'm a neat, except I need to go to this job so I can make money,

02:59:09.840 --> 02:59:12.840
because I like to play gotcha.

02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:13.840
Why are you telling me all this?

02:59:13.840 --> 02:59:15.840
Because you fucking asked.

02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:19.840
But sometimes going around different stores and looking at what they have

02:59:19.840 --> 02:59:21.840
makes me feel super excited.

02:59:21.840 --> 02:59:26.840
I played with my dog for the whole day less.

02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:29.840
Naughty, naughty, you teasing me?

02:59:29.840 --> 02:59:33.840
Naughty, naughty.

02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:36.840
Oh, you have a dog?

02:59:36.840 --> 02:59:38.840
Oh, hi, Meryl.

02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:48.840
Meryl.

02:59:48.840 --> 02:59:53.840
She plays Blue Archive.

02:59:53.840 --> 02:59:57.840
Hello.

02:59:57.840 --> 02:59:59.840
Hello, Meryl.

02:59:59.840 --> 03:00:04.840
My sweet little, cute, fishy.

03:00:04.840 --> 03:00:15.540
Uh-huh, he's a chihuahua, he's a Chihuahua called Wawa, you mean a Chihuahua?

03:00:15.540 --> 03:00:19.620
Yeah, whatever, he's super cute.

03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:23.900
And when you call him Wawa Chin, he waxes his tail and comes to you.

03:00:23.900 --> 03:00:28.060
When he sleeps, it's always next to me too.

03:00:28.060 --> 03:00:32.540
He loves walks too, so I take him to this really big park near my place whenever I get

03:00:32.540 --> 03:00:33.540
a dig off.

03:00:33.740 --> 03:00:36.980
That's what we did last time too.

03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:38.540
So you just hang out with your dog?

03:00:38.540 --> 03:00:39.540
Yeah.

03:00:39.540 --> 03:00:41.900
That sounds great or whatever.

03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:44.140
I love dogs too.

03:00:44.140 --> 03:00:45.140
Really?

03:00:45.140 --> 03:00:49.140
Yeah, I have a husky golden retriever mix.

03:00:49.140 --> 03:00:52.140
That's fucked.

03:00:52.140 --> 03:00:58.820
Well, I hope you give Wawa Chin a nice pat if you ever come around.

03:00:58.820 --> 03:01:01.740
I'm sure you'll end up joining his company too.

03:01:01.740 --> 03:01:07.740
No, she blame it on the alcohol.

03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:12.940
We know her routine, we can go mercy mode now.

03:01:12.940 --> 03:01:14.940
I know, she's giving up a lot of information.

03:01:14.940 --> 03:01:17.940
No, no, no, no, no.

03:01:17.940 --> 03:01:21.940
That's why her color is red.

03:01:21.940 --> 03:01:22.940
Oh my god.

03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:25.340
Do you think he'd be fine to run?

03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:26.340
Why are you?

03:01:26.340 --> 03:01:31.700
This is like the third time I've talked to you and you're like, I need to meet my

03:01:31.700 --> 03:01:32.700
dog.

03:01:32.700 --> 03:01:35.100
Do you think he'd be fine around me though?

03:01:35.100 --> 03:01:40.540
I wonder if he'll think I was trying to take his master away from him because I have a

03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:42.980
question to ask you.

03:01:42.980 --> 03:01:47.700
Will you be my master or my mistress?

03:01:47.700 --> 03:01:48.700
What?

03:01:48.700 --> 03:01:49.700
Never mind.

03:01:49.700 --> 03:01:53.700
How are those socks?

03:01:53.700 --> 03:01:56.700
You gave them to the other girl.

03:01:56.700 --> 03:01:57.700
Who knows?

03:01:57.700 --> 03:01:59.100
That could happen.

03:01:59.100 --> 03:02:02.400
Wawa Chin loves me so much after all.

03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:04.100
You're trying to seal me away.

03:02:04.100 --> 03:02:05.100
Huh?

03:02:05.100 --> 03:02:06.100
What's wrong?

03:02:06.100 --> 03:02:09.100
I'm just trying to buy your affections.

03:02:09.100 --> 03:02:11.400
Uh, nothing at all.

03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:13.500
I'm feeling a little sweaty right now actually.

03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:16.100
God, I wonder what's wrong with me.

03:02:16.100 --> 03:02:17.100
Ugh.

03:02:17.100 --> 03:02:18.100
Are you good?

03:02:18.100 --> 03:02:19.500
Sorry, it's my lush.

03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:24.100
I mean, you want a drink?

03:02:24.100 --> 03:02:28.100
Uh, I think I'm good.

03:02:29.100 --> 03:02:31.100
Is your dog like chocolate?

03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:41.100
Oh, she came and said hi to me.

03:02:41.100 --> 03:02:44.100
I'll be waiting for you, so please come again.

03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:46.100
Yeah, thank you for today.

03:02:46.100 --> 03:02:48.100
Fucking weirdo.

03:02:49.100 --> 03:02:52.100
I hear her boobs jiggle when she waves.

03:02:52.100 --> 03:02:54.100
Like, your boob- wait, actually.

03:02:54.100 --> 03:02:55.100
I'm waving my hand.

03:02:55.100 --> 03:02:57.100
Are my boobs jiggling?

03:02:57.100 --> 03:02:58.100
Hold it.

03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:01.100
What's that buzzing noise?

03:03:01.100 --> 03:03:03.100
Don't worry about it.

03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:07.100
It's air conditioning.

03:03:07.100 --> 03:03:09.100
It's the AC.

03:03:13.100 --> 03:03:16.100
Okay, we had a good fun conversation.

03:03:16.100 --> 03:03:19.100
I'm looking forward to going to work now.

03:03:24.100 --> 03:03:26.100
Can I, like, what is this thing?

03:03:26.100 --> 03:03:28.100
Okay, I don't know what that means.

03:03:28.100 --> 03:03:30.100
Um, I should save.

03:03:30.100 --> 03:03:31.100
I'll save.

03:03:33.100 --> 03:03:35.100
Like, how do they dance in the corner?

03:03:37.100 --> 03:03:38.100
Um.

03:03:40.100 --> 03:03:43.100
Okay, there's not a lot to do in this game,

03:03:43.100 --> 03:03:45.100
and it's kind of annoying.

03:03:45.100 --> 03:03:48.100
I'm like, uh, okay, so I get the gifts, I talk.

03:03:48.100 --> 03:03:50.100
Is that really it?

03:03:53.100 --> 03:03:55.100
I don't think AC sounds like that.

03:03:55.100 --> 03:03:57.100
Don't worry about it.

03:03:58.100 --> 03:04:00.100
Come on, give me white screen.

03:04:00.100 --> 03:04:01.100
Fuck.

03:04:02.100 --> 03:04:03.100
What should I lose?

03:04:03.100 --> 03:04:04.100
Oh!

03:04:04.100 --> 03:04:06.100
Oh, give me a red screen and I run?

03:04:06.100 --> 03:04:07.100
Okay.

03:04:07.100 --> 03:04:10.100
Okay, okay, my strat is totally wrong then.

03:04:10.100 --> 03:04:12.100
Usually, I thought the thing would give an indicator,

03:04:12.100 --> 03:04:14.100
but it really doesn't.

03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:24.100
Bro, what the f-

03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:26.100
Okay.

03:04:37.100 --> 03:04:38.100
Okay.

03:04:38.100 --> 03:04:39.100
That's fine.

03:04:41.100 --> 03:04:43.100
No longer yippee.

03:04:43.100 --> 03:04:46.100
Uh, buy some perfume,

03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:49.100
because I want to know what she smells like,

03:04:49.100 --> 03:04:52.100
and so I can buy the same perfume and we can,

03:04:52.100 --> 03:04:55.100
I can spray it on my pillowcase

03:04:55.100 --> 03:04:57.100
and pretend I'm sleeping next to her.

03:04:57.100 --> 03:04:58.100
What should I drink today?

03:04:58.100 --> 03:05:00.100
Beer, wine, champagne?

03:05:00.100 --> 03:05:01.100
Let's just get in there first.

03:05:01.100 --> 03:05:02.100
Go!

03:05:03.100 --> 03:05:04.100
Sorry, jumpscare.

03:05:05.100 --> 03:05:09.100
Please, can I talk to the girl in blue?

03:05:11.100 --> 03:05:13.100
Thanks for visiting me today.

03:05:13.100 --> 03:05:15.100
Can I please talk to that bitch over there?

03:05:15.100 --> 03:05:16.100
It's all I want.

03:05:18.100 --> 03:05:20.100
She has a fatter ass than you.

03:05:20.100 --> 03:05:21.100
Um, okay.

03:05:21.100 --> 03:05:23.100
Well, what drink did you want?

03:05:24.100 --> 03:05:26.100
Uh, I'm feeling spicy today.

03:05:28.100 --> 03:05:30.100
I'm gonna get the Bunny Max.

03:05:31.100 --> 03:05:33.100
Because I'm gonna...

03:05:33.100 --> 03:05:34.100
Nevermind.

03:05:36.100 --> 03:05:37.100
Can I have some too?

03:05:37.100 --> 03:05:38.100
No!

03:05:38.100 --> 03:05:39.100
You can't!

03:05:40.100 --> 03:05:41.100
Go away!

03:05:46.100 --> 03:05:48.100
Please, please bring me her.

03:05:48.100 --> 03:05:49.100
Please.

03:05:49.100 --> 03:05:51.100
Oh, thank God!

03:05:51.100 --> 03:05:52.100
Finally!

03:05:56.100 --> 03:06:00.100
I guess the point is to lift the fantasy of having your life ruined by hostess club addiction.

03:06:01.100 --> 03:06:02.100
Alright.

03:06:03.100 --> 03:06:04.100
One voice.

03:06:05.100 --> 03:06:06.100
One voice.

03:06:06.100 --> 03:06:08.100
One voice to you, governor.

03:06:10.100 --> 03:06:12.100
Oh, I saw some applesauce left.

03:06:12.100 --> 03:06:13.100
I didn't even notice.

03:06:17.100 --> 03:06:18.100
Blue.

03:06:19.100 --> 03:06:20.100
Sporty tomboy.

03:06:21.100 --> 03:06:22.100
Mommy vibe.

03:06:22.100 --> 03:06:23.100
Smoker voice.

03:06:23.100 --> 03:06:25.100
Sexiest possible voice.

03:06:25.100 --> 03:06:26.100
She's very coup d'etre.

03:06:26.100 --> 03:06:27.100
Really?

03:06:28.100 --> 03:06:29.100
Nerdy voice.

03:06:29.100 --> 03:06:30.100
Mommy.

03:06:31.100 --> 03:06:32.100
Theater attitude is like first.

03:06:32.100 --> 03:06:33.100
Okay.

03:06:33.100 --> 03:06:34.100
We'll chat a little bit.

03:06:34.100 --> 03:06:35.100
I'm gonna give her a present.

03:06:36.100 --> 03:06:37.100
Actually, no.

03:06:37.100 --> 03:06:38.100
I'm not gonna give her a turn just yet.

03:06:38.100 --> 03:06:39.100
I'll give her...

03:06:39.100 --> 03:06:41.100
I might extend my time with her.

03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:43.100
Because I've talked to them the most.

03:06:43.100 --> 03:06:44.100
They're two girls.

03:06:45.100 --> 03:06:46.100
Wanna get some food?

03:06:47.100 --> 03:06:48.100
Um...

03:06:50.100 --> 03:06:52.100
Let's get some whatever the fuck this is.

03:06:55.100 --> 03:06:56.100
I love this.

03:06:56.100 --> 03:06:57.100
This is really delicious.

03:06:58.100 --> 03:07:00.100
I'm feeling all sorts of happiness.

03:07:01.100 --> 03:07:02.100
Oh, hello.

03:07:02.100 --> 03:07:03.100
Nice to meet you.

03:07:04.100 --> 03:07:06.100
Would you like to introduce yourself?

03:07:07.100 --> 03:07:08.100
Oh, yeah.

03:07:08.100 --> 03:07:10.100
You may call me Hito Kanda.

03:07:11.100 --> 03:07:12.100
Oh.

03:07:13.100 --> 03:07:15.100
You don't have to be polite with me.

03:07:17.100 --> 03:07:18.100
I see.

03:07:18.100 --> 03:07:19.100
I mean, okay.

03:07:19.100 --> 03:07:20.100
I'm Hito Kanda.

03:07:20.100 --> 03:07:22.100
I help my friend for work.

03:07:23.100 --> 03:07:24.100
I didn't ask that.

03:07:25.100 --> 03:07:27.100
You help your friends?

03:07:27.100 --> 03:07:28.100
Like...

03:07:28.100 --> 03:07:29.100
with a hand job?

03:07:30.100 --> 03:07:31.100
Huh?

03:07:31.100 --> 03:07:32.100
Yeah.

03:07:33.100 --> 03:07:35.100
I was working at a company up until recently,

03:07:35.100 --> 03:07:37.100
but I messed up.

03:07:37.100 --> 03:07:38.100
It got fired.

03:07:39.100 --> 03:07:40.100
Fired?

03:07:41.100 --> 03:07:42.100
Right.

03:07:43.100 --> 03:07:46.100
Are you bad at holding conversation?

03:07:48.100 --> 03:07:50.100
Are you a person of a few words?

03:07:51.100 --> 03:07:54.100
I guess I don't speak much.

03:07:56.100 --> 03:07:57.100
Um...

03:07:57.100 --> 03:07:58.100
Hito.

03:07:59.100 --> 03:08:00.100
Why do you sound like a fucking robot?

03:08:00.100 --> 03:08:01.100
Yeah?

03:08:02.100 --> 03:08:03.100
I'm...

03:08:03.100 --> 03:08:05.100
Oh, I just spilled apple sauce on my shirt.

03:08:08.100 --> 03:08:09.100
Ah!

03:08:09.100 --> 03:08:10.100
I was choked on it.

03:08:11.100 --> 03:08:12.100
Ow, I just hit my head on my mic.

03:08:13.100 --> 03:08:14.100
I'm falling apart.

03:08:16.100 --> 03:08:17.100
I'm sorry.

03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:21.100
You're kind of a loser.

03:08:27.100 --> 03:08:29.100
That guy is a charmer.

03:08:34.100 --> 03:08:35.100
What does that mean?

03:08:36.100 --> 03:08:38.100
I'm sorry I'm like this.

03:08:38.100 --> 03:08:40.100
Maybe you won't be able to have a good time.

03:08:41.100 --> 03:08:42.100
It's okay.

03:08:42.100 --> 03:08:43.100
Who knows what will happen?

03:08:44.100 --> 03:08:45.100
You can suck my dick.

03:08:46.100 --> 03:08:48.100
I can suck your toes.

03:08:49.100 --> 03:08:50.100
You can suck my dick.

03:08:51.100 --> 03:08:52.100
Just met each other.

03:08:53.100 --> 03:08:54.100
You can suck my dick.

03:08:55.100 --> 03:08:57.100
I think it would be nice if you could suck my dick.

03:08:57.100 --> 03:08:59.100
Just take things slow, you know?

03:08:59.100 --> 03:09:00.100
First base.

03:09:01.100 --> 03:09:02.100
Suck in my dick.

03:09:03.100 --> 03:09:04.100
No rush.

03:09:04.100 --> 03:09:06.100
You already started to get to know each other.

03:09:08.100 --> 03:09:10.100
Oh, thank you.

03:09:11.100 --> 03:09:12.100
You're kind one, Haido.

03:09:13.100 --> 03:09:15.100
Do you want some alcohol?

03:09:16.100 --> 03:09:17.100
What should I do?

03:09:17.100 --> 03:09:19.100
Is there anything I should prepare?

03:09:20.100 --> 03:09:21.100
Yeah!

03:09:22.100 --> 03:09:24.100
My efforts have been rewarded.

03:09:25.100 --> 03:09:27.100
I want to drink something delicious.

03:09:29.100 --> 03:09:30.100
What drink did you want?

03:09:31.100 --> 03:09:33.100
I'm giving her like several different voices.

03:09:33.100 --> 03:09:34.100
I'm so sorry.

03:09:34.100 --> 03:09:35.100
I'm buying you...

03:09:36.100 --> 03:09:37.100
I don't have enough money.

03:09:40.100 --> 03:09:41.100
Okay, what drink do I want?

03:09:41.100 --> 03:09:42.100
So I will have...

03:09:43.100 --> 03:09:44.100
I'll just have a beer.

03:09:45.100 --> 03:09:46.100
Where's the beer?

03:09:46.100 --> 03:09:47.100
Where the fuck is the beer?

03:09:47.100 --> 03:09:48.100
I'll just have a beer.

03:09:48.100 --> 03:09:50.100
I don't know why we have it in these glasses, but...

03:09:52.100 --> 03:09:53.100
Can I have a drink with you?

03:09:54.100 --> 03:09:57.100
Yes, my beautiful princess.

03:09:57.100 --> 03:09:59.100
I'm going to get you a bunny punch.

03:10:01.100 --> 03:10:03.100
Because I'm going to punch my dick into your womb

03:10:03.100 --> 03:10:04.100
and fill you with children.

03:10:06.100 --> 03:10:08.100
I like that.

03:10:08.100 --> 03:10:09.100
All right.

03:10:13.100 --> 03:10:14.100
What?

03:10:14.100 --> 03:10:15.100
That's it?

03:10:15.100 --> 03:10:16.100
I expected more.

03:10:19.100 --> 03:10:20.100
The deep Riz.

03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:22.100
S2 Riz.

03:10:22.100 --> 03:10:23.100
Thank you.

03:10:24.100 --> 03:10:25.100
Okay, I have a present for you.

03:10:29.100 --> 03:10:32.100
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

03:10:33.100 --> 03:10:34.100
I hope you like it.

03:10:35.100 --> 03:10:36.100
It smells like my mom.

03:10:39.100 --> 03:10:40.100
What?

03:10:40.100 --> 03:10:41.100
Don't worry about it.

03:10:44.100 --> 03:10:45.100
Okay, thanks.

03:10:47.100 --> 03:10:48.100
We have to take care of it.

03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:50.100
Take care of what?

03:10:51.100 --> 03:10:52.100
Your dick.

03:10:52.100 --> 03:10:53.100
Huh?

03:10:54.100 --> 03:10:55.100
What?

03:10:58.100 --> 03:11:00.100
I keep doing double takes to see if this is a title.

03:11:00.100 --> 03:11:02.100
Like I can't get a title.

03:11:02.100 --> 03:11:04.100
Like my role.

03:11:05.100 --> 03:11:10.100
Why are they just staring at each other and quiet?

03:11:10.100 --> 03:11:12.100
Oh my God.

03:11:14.100 --> 03:11:16.100
Wait, wait, you buy a drink for the bartenders?

03:11:16.100 --> 03:11:18.100
Yes, yes, you do.

03:11:20.100 --> 03:11:23.100
This is going to stream today.

03:11:25.100 --> 03:11:27.100
Is there anything you want to talk about?

03:11:28.100 --> 03:11:33.100
Yeah, you think tomorrow will be sunny or whatever?

03:11:36.100 --> 03:11:38.100
There's a monsoon raging outside.

03:11:41.100 --> 03:11:42.100
I have no idea.

03:11:43.100 --> 03:11:44.100
I have no idea.

03:11:45.100 --> 03:11:46.100
I have no idea.

03:11:47.100 --> 03:11:48.100
I have no idea.

03:11:49.100 --> 03:11:50.100
Sorry.

03:11:53.100 --> 03:11:56.100
Buy a drink for the bartender to take a small sip and throw it into the plants.

03:11:56.100 --> 03:11:57.100
Hell yeah.

03:11:57.100 --> 03:11:59.100
But like how do they pace themselves?

03:11:59.100 --> 03:12:03.100
You have to have like quite, like you have to be able to handle your liquor if you're

03:12:03.100 --> 03:12:09.100
serving patrons for, let's say like, let's say your shift is like five hours and

03:12:09.100 --> 03:12:11.100
maybe you hang out with a guy for each hour.

03:12:11.100 --> 03:12:13.100
Like how many of you buying you more drinks?

03:12:13.100 --> 03:12:14.100
Is this happening?

03:12:14.100 --> 03:12:16.100
Like I need to know the schematics.

03:12:21.100 --> 03:12:23.100
Do they really only take one sip?

03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:26.100
I don't know.

03:12:26.100 --> 03:12:29.100
No, like legit, like tell me the tea.

03:12:30.100 --> 03:12:31.100
Is the tea piping hot?

03:12:31.100 --> 03:12:32.100
Cause spill it.

03:12:34.100 --> 03:12:35.100
You don't drink with every patron?

03:12:35.100 --> 03:12:36.100
Okay.

03:12:36.100 --> 03:12:37.100
Do they actually puke constantly?

03:12:38.100 --> 03:12:40.100
This is the equivalent of the ghost anime top.

03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:42.100
That fucking dump is hilarious.

03:12:44.100 --> 03:12:45.100
It's basically their tipping.

03:12:45.100 --> 03:12:46.100
They mix it for themselves.

03:12:46.100 --> 03:12:47.100
They probably don't mix.

03:12:47.100 --> 03:12:49.100
Oh, that's true.

03:12:49.100 --> 03:12:50.100
Cause I had a friend.

03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:52.100
Actually, I don't have a friend.

03:12:52.100 --> 03:12:53.100
She does this currently.

03:12:53.100 --> 03:12:54.100
Olive.

03:12:54.100 --> 03:12:58.100
She bartends and she tells me sometimes customers try to buy her a drink and she just literally

03:12:58.100 --> 03:13:02.100
gives herself like a sprite and says it's a gin and tonic.

03:13:04.100 --> 03:13:05.100
Yeah, or they mix the drink of water.

03:13:06.100 --> 03:13:08.100
Excuse me, hostess.

03:13:08.100 --> 03:13:09.100
Will you bear my children?

03:13:11.100 --> 03:13:14.100
Like there is a job somewhere in the world that you just get paid to drink.

03:13:14.100 --> 03:13:15.100
That's basis.

03:13:15.100 --> 03:13:16.100
That's kind of cool.

03:13:16.100 --> 03:13:17.100
I'm like hostess job.

03:13:17.100 --> 03:13:18.100
That's not bad.

03:13:19.100 --> 03:13:20.100
Like does it pay well?

03:13:21.100 --> 03:13:26.100
You know, shall we look up the weather forecast cause we're fucking nerds?

03:13:27.100 --> 03:13:29.100
Are you always curious about the weather?

03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:35.100
I just want to know how wet you're going to be tomorrow.

03:13:35.100 --> 03:13:36.100
No, not really.

03:13:36.100 --> 03:13:37.100
I'm just making small talk.

03:13:40.100 --> 03:13:41.100
Oh, sorry.

03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:43.100
I didn't mean anything by that.

03:13:44.100 --> 03:13:46.100
This is who I am all the time.

03:13:47.100 --> 03:13:48.100
Is that okay with you?

03:13:49.100 --> 03:13:51.100
Can you please marry me?

03:13:52.100 --> 03:13:53.100
It's all right with me.

03:13:53.100 --> 03:13:54.100
So please marry me.

03:13:54.100 --> 03:13:55.100
I'm on my knees.

03:13:55.100 --> 03:13:56.100
Please.

03:13:56.100 --> 03:13:57.100
I'm begging.

03:13:57.100 --> 03:14:00.100
We're just starting to get into each other, but you're the one in my life.

03:14:01.100 --> 03:14:03.100
You're a peculiar one.

03:14:03.100 --> 03:14:04.100
Please.

03:14:05.100 --> 03:14:06.100
You laughed just now, didn't you?

03:14:06.100 --> 03:14:07.100
That means you should marry me.

03:14:08.100 --> 03:14:09.100
I also know where you live.

03:14:09.100 --> 03:14:10.100
I know where all the girls here live.

03:14:12.100 --> 03:14:13.100
Okay.

03:14:13.100 --> 03:14:16.100
You have a cute smile, especially when you're sleeping.

03:14:17.100 --> 03:14:18.100
What?

03:14:18.100 --> 03:14:19.100
Anyways.

03:14:20.100 --> 03:14:22.100
Oh, uh, thanks.

03:14:23.100 --> 03:14:24.100
What will you do?

03:14:24.100 --> 03:14:25.100
Are you still going to drink?

03:14:26.100 --> 03:14:27.100
Should I prepare some more alcohol?

03:14:28.100 --> 03:14:29.100
Yeah.

03:14:30.100 --> 03:14:31.100
Thank you.

03:14:31.100 --> 03:14:32.100
It means you'll still be with me.

03:14:33.100 --> 03:14:34.100
What drink did you want?

03:14:35.100 --> 03:14:37.100
Uh, can I get like absolutely black?

03:14:37.100 --> 03:14:38.100
Oh, I can only have three drinks.

03:14:38.100 --> 03:14:39.100
Okay.

03:14:40.100 --> 03:14:44.100
Um, I'll have some wine for Chip.

03:14:45.100 --> 03:14:46.100
We're hanging out.

03:14:49.100 --> 03:14:51.100
Beer before liquor, never been sicker.

03:14:51.100 --> 03:14:52.100
Liquor before beer.

03:14:52.100 --> 03:14:53.100
You're in the clear.

03:14:55.100 --> 03:14:56.100
Can I have a drink with you?

03:14:56.100 --> 03:14:57.100
Of course you can.

03:14:57.100 --> 03:14:58.100
Girlie pop.

03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:01.100
Only the best for my queen.

03:15:01.100 --> 03:15:03.100
Only the best for my queen.

03:15:05.100 --> 03:15:06.100
I'm so happy.

03:15:06.100 --> 03:15:07.100
I'll get the bottle.

03:15:14.100 --> 03:15:16.100
Oh, I got enough cash.

03:15:16.100 --> 03:15:17.100
Yeah, I got fucking enough cash.

03:15:21.100 --> 03:15:23.100
You can buy the 50K you had bought all about ending.

03:15:24.100 --> 03:15:25.100
Let's chat.

03:15:28.100 --> 03:15:29.100
Are you having fun?

03:15:30.100 --> 03:15:32.100
She looks so fucking pissed off right now.

03:15:33.100 --> 03:15:34.100
Yeah.

03:15:34.100 --> 03:15:35.100
Why are you looking at me like that?

03:15:35.100 --> 03:15:37.100
No, I think I'm enjoying myself.

03:15:37.100 --> 03:15:38.100
Please stop looking at me like that.

03:15:39.100 --> 03:15:40.100
Good.

03:15:40.100 --> 03:15:41.100
Well, that's nice.

03:15:42.100 --> 03:15:45.100
Miuka Chen, are you enjoying yourself?

03:15:46.100 --> 03:15:47.100
Still undecided.

03:15:48.100 --> 03:15:49.100
You kind of smell bad.

03:15:50.100 --> 03:15:52.100
I would rather be hanging out with the people over there.

03:15:53.100 --> 03:15:57.100
They actually buy me the 50KN bottle.

03:15:58.100 --> 03:15:59.100
But it's whatever.

03:16:01.100 --> 03:16:03.100
I don't exactly hate it.

03:16:08.100 --> 03:16:09.100
Why don't you hate it?

03:16:12.100 --> 03:16:13.100
Is that it?

03:16:13.100 --> 03:16:14.100
I don't even know why I asked that.

03:16:15.100 --> 03:16:17.100
She's looking at us like we're garbage.

03:16:17.100 --> 03:16:20.100
You kind of gross me out and you kind of disgust me.

03:16:22.100 --> 03:16:24.100
I would rather not hang out with trash like you,

03:16:25.100 --> 03:16:27.100
but I need to pay the bills.

03:16:28.100 --> 03:16:29.100
So here I am.

03:16:32.100 --> 03:16:33.100
I don't know.

03:16:33.100 --> 03:16:34.100
I wonder why.

03:16:35.100 --> 03:16:37.100
Um, huh?

03:16:38.100 --> 03:16:39.100
I don't believe you.

03:16:40.100 --> 03:16:41.100
I know.

03:16:41.100 --> 03:16:42.100
Are you really enjoying it?

03:16:42.100 --> 03:16:44.100
Why are these girls gaslighting me?

03:16:45.100 --> 03:16:48.100
They literally like, I'm fine and they're like, you're not okay.

03:16:49.100 --> 03:16:50.100
Tell me what's wrong.

03:16:51.100 --> 03:16:52.100
Give me your money.

03:16:53.100 --> 03:16:54.100
And buy me a drink.

03:16:55.100 --> 03:16:56.100
And I'll pretend to cheer you up.

03:16:56.100 --> 03:17:02.100
So when you come here, you think you're getting serotonin and dopamine from only me.

03:17:02.100 --> 03:17:06.100
So then you have to come and you have to spend more money to feel like you're okay.

03:17:06.100 --> 03:17:09.100
Because you need me to tell you when you're okay or not.

03:17:09.100 --> 03:17:10.100
This is toxic as hell.

03:17:15.100 --> 03:17:18.100
This is a scyop.

03:17:19.100 --> 03:17:20.100
This is a fucking scyop.

03:17:23.100 --> 03:17:25.100
Just, I don't know how, but it is.

03:17:30.100 --> 03:17:31.100
It's okay.

03:17:32.100 --> 03:17:33.100
You don't have to worry about me.

03:17:35.100 --> 03:17:36.100
I worry though.

03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:37.100
You're my customer.

03:17:38.100 --> 03:17:39.100
You must have a good time.

03:17:40.100 --> 03:17:42.100
You must have a good time.

03:17:43.100 --> 03:17:44.100
Okay.

03:17:44.100 --> 03:17:45.100
Is she an android?

03:17:47.100 --> 03:17:48.100
I don't know, man.

03:17:48.100 --> 03:17:49.100
Okay.

03:17:50.100 --> 03:17:53.100
Well, everyone enjoys themselves in their own way.

03:17:55.100 --> 03:17:57.100
I'm not enjoying this.

03:17:57.100 --> 03:17:59.100
I wish I was doing something else.

03:17:59.100 --> 03:18:01.100
You're so odd.

03:18:01.100 --> 03:18:02.100
Did you know that?

03:18:04.100 --> 03:18:05.100
Yeah, I know.

03:18:07.100 --> 03:18:08.100
It's whatever.

03:18:09.100 --> 03:18:11.100
I don't exactly hate it.

03:18:11.100 --> 03:18:12.100
I hate you.

03:18:13.100 --> 03:18:15.100
You're not worth my time.

03:18:17.100 --> 03:18:18.100
Oh, it's getting late.

03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:19.100
I should go home soon.

03:18:20.100 --> 03:18:21.100
Yeah, you should.

03:18:23.100 --> 03:18:24.100
Shit, that's a lot of money.

03:18:26.100 --> 03:18:27.100
See you.

03:18:27.100 --> 03:18:28.100
I'll be waiting.

03:18:29.100 --> 03:18:30.100
I just wanted to step on me.

03:18:31.100 --> 03:18:32.100
Yeah, thanks for everything.

03:18:32.100 --> 03:18:33.100
See you soon.

03:18:37.100 --> 03:18:38.100
Statement.

03:18:38.100 --> 03:18:39.100
It did good times.

03:18:40.100 --> 03:18:42.100
We had a good conversation.

03:18:42.100 --> 03:18:44.100
I'm looking forward to going to work now.

03:18:46.100 --> 03:18:48.100
I don't want to go back there again.

03:18:49.100 --> 03:18:51.100
Where's your money gone?

03:18:52.100 --> 03:18:53.100
All right.

03:18:53.100 --> 03:18:54.100
Pay me.

03:18:55.100 --> 03:18:56.100
Fuck you.

03:18:56.100 --> 03:18:57.100
Pay me.

03:18:57.100 --> 03:18:58.100
What?

03:18:58.100 --> 03:18:59.100
I thought I was going to get more money.

03:18:59.100 --> 03:19:00.100
Okay.

03:19:00.100 --> 03:19:01.100
Gamble time.

03:19:04.100 --> 03:19:08.100
Actually, I should have bought more gifts

03:19:08.100 --> 03:19:09.100
before I did this.

03:19:15.100 --> 03:19:16.100
Fuck it.

03:19:19.100 --> 03:19:20.100
We're going to win big.

03:19:21.100 --> 03:19:22.100
We're going to win big.

03:19:29.100 --> 03:19:30.100
We're going again.

03:19:30.100 --> 03:19:31.100
We're making our money back.

03:19:33.100 --> 03:19:37.100
Work, drink, fuck bitches, get money,

03:19:37.100 --> 03:19:38.100
gamble.

03:19:38.100 --> 03:19:40.100
We're hitting the lottery today.

03:19:43.100 --> 03:19:45.100
Let's fucking go again.

03:19:45.100 --> 03:19:46.100
Again.

03:19:46.100 --> 03:19:48.100
Make it fucking happen.

03:19:49.100 --> 03:19:51.100
We're making it fucking happen.

03:19:55.100 --> 03:19:57.100
Is this what trainwrecks feels like?

03:19:57.100 --> 03:19:58.100
Oh fuck.

03:19:58.100 --> 03:19:59.100
When he wins.

03:20:02.100 --> 03:20:03.100
Another one.

03:20:04.100 --> 03:20:06.100
That was a small fish.

03:20:06.100 --> 03:20:07.100
Small fish gamble.

03:20:07.100 --> 03:20:09.100
We're going to win big.

03:20:11.100 --> 03:20:13.100
Nah, we didn't win that much.

03:20:18.100 --> 03:20:19.100
Hello, hello.

03:20:19.100 --> 03:20:20.100
Welcome back.

03:20:25.100 --> 03:20:27.100
Fuck your mother one more time.

03:20:27.100 --> 03:20:28.100
Just kidding.

03:20:28.100 --> 03:20:29.100
Not one more time.

03:20:29.100 --> 03:20:30.100
We're just going to gamble the max amount of times

03:20:30.100 --> 03:20:31.100
you can gamble.

03:20:32.100 --> 03:20:33.100
Please.

03:20:37.100 --> 03:20:38.100
All right.

03:20:38.100 --> 03:20:39.100
All right.

03:20:39.100 --> 03:20:40.100
All right.

03:20:40.100 --> 03:20:41.100
All right.

03:20:41.100 --> 03:20:42.100
All right.

03:20:42.100 --> 03:20:43.100
Keep going.

03:20:43.100 --> 03:20:44.100
Keep going.

03:20:44.100 --> 03:20:45.100
We can gamble 10 times a day.

03:20:45.100 --> 03:20:46.100
We're doing it.

03:20:46.100 --> 03:20:47.100
We're doing it.

03:20:49.100 --> 03:20:51.100
It feels like playing gotcha indeed.

03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:54.100
You hit that one character.

03:20:55.100 --> 03:20:56.100
Fuck yeah.

03:20:56.100 --> 03:20:58.100
We're kind of back where we started one more time.

03:21:02.100 --> 03:21:03.100
Let's get it.

03:21:03.100 --> 03:21:04.100
Let's get it.

03:21:04.100 --> 03:21:05.100
Let's get it.

03:21:05.100 --> 03:21:06.100
Let's get it.

03:21:06.100 --> 03:21:07.100
We're good.

03:21:07.100 --> 03:21:08.100
We're good.

03:21:08.100 --> 03:21:09.100
We're hitting it.

03:21:09.100 --> 03:21:10.100
We're hitting it.

03:21:10.100 --> 03:21:11.100
We're hitting it.

03:21:11.100 --> 03:21:12.100
Okay.

03:21:12.100 --> 03:21:13.100
We're...

03:21:13.100 --> 03:21:14.100
It's fine.

03:21:14.100 --> 03:21:15.100
Don't worry about it.

03:21:15.100 --> 03:21:16.100
Don't worry about it.

03:21:16.100 --> 03:21:17.100
We're going.

03:21:17.100 --> 03:21:18.100
We're back.

03:21:18.100 --> 03:21:19.100
We're going to be back.

03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:20.100
Watch.

03:21:20.100 --> 03:21:21.100
We're back.

03:21:21.100 --> 03:21:22.100
We're back.

03:21:25.100 --> 03:21:27.100
I can't gamble anymore.

03:21:32.100 --> 03:21:33.100
We're back.

03:21:33.100 --> 03:21:34.100
We're back.

03:21:34.100 --> 03:21:35.100
Oh, fuck.

03:21:36.100 --> 03:21:37.100
We're back.

03:21:38.100 --> 03:21:39.100
We're so back.

03:21:40.100 --> 03:21:41.100
Don't worry about it.

03:21:41.100 --> 03:21:44.100
Fuck the negative 20K yen.

03:21:44.100 --> 03:21:45.100
We didn't need that.

03:21:45.100 --> 03:21:46.100
We're getting big.

03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:47.100
We're hitting it big.

03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:54.100
We're hitting it big.

03:21:56.100 --> 03:21:57.100
It doesn't matter.

03:21:57.100 --> 03:21:58.100
It doesn't matter.

03:21:59.100 --> 03:22:00.100
The next one.

03:22:01.100 --> 03:22:02.100
The next one.

03:22:08.100 --> 03:22:09.100
The next one.

03:22:09.100 --> 03:22:10.100
The next one.

03:22:14.100 --> 03:22:15.100
I don't have a problem.

03:22:15.100 --> 03:22:16.100
I don't have a problem.

03:22:18.100 --> 03:22:19.100
I don't have a problem.

03:22:20.100 --> 03:22:21.100
Fuck you.

03:22:23.100 --> 03:22:25.100
I want to be back at 70K.

03:22:26.100 --> 03:22:27.100
I'm not going to go bankrupt.

03:22:27.100 --> 03:22:28.100
Don't worry about it.

03:22:28.100 --> 03:22:29.100
Don't worry about it.

03:22:29.100 --> 03:22:30.100
We're fine.

03:22:31.100 --> 03:22:32.100
We're fine.

03:22:38.100 --> 03:22:39.100
We're fine.

03:22:48.100 --> 03:22:49.100
The girls are worried.

03:22:49.100 --> 03:22:50.100
Don't worry about it.

03:22:50.100 --> 03:22:51.100
They're not worried.

03:22:51.100 --> 03:22:52.100
They're cheering me on.

03:22:52.100 --> 03:22:53.100
See?

03:22:53.100 --> 03:22:54.100
Boom.

03:22:54.100 --> 03:22:55.100
Boom.

03:22:57.100 --> 03:22:59.100
I don't need to spend time

03:23:00.100 --> 03:23:02.100
with those bitches at Barney Garden.

03:23:03.100 --> 03:23:05.100
I'm a hustler, baby.

03:23:05.100 --> 03:23:06.100
All right?

03:23:07.100 --> 03:23:09.100
I'm a hustler, baby.

03:23:10.100 --> 03:23:12.100
Aggressive T key.

03:23:13.100 --> 03:23:14.100
The key.

03:23:14.100 --> 03:23:15.100
I can't fucking say anything.

03:23:15.100 --> 03:23:16.100
Key.

03:23:18.100 --> 03:23:19.100
Touched.

03:23:19.100 --> 03:23:20.100
Key type.

03:23:25.100 --> 03:23:26.100
We might be back.

03:23:26.100 --> 03:23:27.100
We're not quite.

03:23:27.100 --> 03:23:28.100
We're getting there.

03:23:30.100 --> 03:23:31.100
She be mistress.

03:23:31.100 --> 03:23:32.100
Lovely.

03:23:32.100 --> 03:23:33.100
I'm begging you.

03:23:33.100 --> 03:23:34.100
Don't lose the house.

03:23:35.100 --> 03:23:36.100
Don't worry.

03:23:36.100 --> 03:23:38.100
The house where the house is still okay.

03:23:40.100 --> 03:23:42.100
We had to sell one of our children,

03:23:42.100 --> 03:23:43.100
but it's fine.

03:23:45.100 --> 03:23:47.100
Very some sweet nice people

03:23:47.100 --> 03:23:49.100
are taking care of her now.

03:23:53.100 --> 03:23:54.100
All right, we lost the house.

03:23:58.100 --> 03:23:59.100
You know what that means.

03:23:59.100 --> 03:24:00.100
We got it.

03:24:00.100 --> 03:24:01.100
We got it.

03:24:02.100 --> 03:24:03.100
We got it, you know.

03:24:07.100 --> 03:24:08.100
It's not over.

03:24:08.100 --> 03:24:10.100
It's not over till I say it's over.

03:24:10.100 --> 03:24:11.100
All right.

03:24:11.100 --> 03:24:12.100
All right.

03:24:14.100 --> 03:24:16.100
It's not over till I say it's over.

03:24:24.100 --> 03:24:25.100
I didn't perform that well

03:24:25.100 --> 03:24:27.100
because I just was gambling my money away.

03:24:27.100 --> 03:24:28.100
All right.

03:24:28.100 --> 03:24:29.100
Let's go see the bitches.

03:24:33.100 --> 03:24:35.100
I sold Ernesto the fuck.

03:24:38.100 --> 03:24:39.100
Only lose when you stop.

03:24:39.100 --> 03:24:40.100
Exactly.

03:24:40.100 --> 03:24:41.100
Hello, hello.

03:24:41.100 --> 03:24:42.100
Welcome in.

03:24:44.100 --> 03:24:46.100
When you start selling up parent members.

03:24:48.100 --> 03:24:50.100
That was the first things I sold.

03:24:50.100 --> 03:24:51.100
Sorry guys.

03:24:51.100 --> 03:24:52.100
Sorry.

03:24:55.100 --> 03:24:57.100
Your hair is clipping through your hair.

03:24:57.100 --> 03:24:58.100
What is that?

03:24:58.100 --> 03:24:59.100
Whoa.

03:24:59.100 --> 03:25:00.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:25:00.100 --> 03:25:01.100
Whoa.

03:25:02.100 --> 03:25:03.100
Sorry, I was looking.

03:25:03.100 --> 03:25:04.100
I had a that's a raven moment.

03:25:04.100 --> 03:25:06.100
I was looking into the future at her dialogue

03:25:06.100 --> 03:25:07.100
and into the past.

03:25:07.100 --> 03:25:08.100
You mean a memory?

03:25:08.100 --> 03:25:09.100
Don't worry about it.

03:25:10.100 --> 03:25:12.100
Oh, you came on my tits again.

03:25:12.100 --> 03:25:14.100
I tell you not to just walk in

03:25:14.100 --> 03:25:15.100
and you just shoot on me.

03:25:15.100 --> 03:25:16.100
I don't.

03:25:16.100 --> 03:25:17.100
What drink did you want?

03:25:19.100 --> 03:25:22.100
Oh, you know what?

03:25:26.100 --> 03:25:30.100
Can I have some too?

03:25:30.100 --> 03:25:31.100
No.

03:25:31.100 --> 03:25:32.100
You can't.

03:25:33.100 --> 03:25:34.100
You can't.

03:25:34.100 --> 03:25:35.100
No.

03:25:35.100 --> 03:25:36.100
Get away from me.

03:25:38.100 --> 03:25:39.100
A customer called me.

03:25:39.100 --> 03:25:40.100
Yeah.

03:25:40.100 --> 03:25:41.100
Yeah.

03:25:41.100 --> 03:25:42.100
Yeah.

03:25:42.100 --> 03:25:43.100
Give me the blue girl.

03:25:44.100 --> 03:25:45.100
Give me the blue girl.

03:25:45.100 --> 03:25:46.100
Fuck whatever.

03:25:46.100 --> 03:25:47.100
You're good enough.

03:25:48.100 --> 03:25:49.100
How's it going?

03:25:51.100 --> 03:25:53.100
What do you do on your days off?

03:25:53.100 --> 03:25:54.100
Hi, Chan.

03:25:54.100 --> 03:25:57.100
Oh, are you asking me on a T?

03:25:57.100 --> 03:25:59.100
You're pretty aggressive, huh?

03:25:59.100 --> 03:26:00.100
Hi, Chan.

03:26:00.100 --> 03:26:02.100
Even though you turned down my threesome.

03:26:02.100 --> 03:26:03.100
What?

03:26:03.100 --> 03:26:05.100
I thought you were past this.

03:26:06.100 --> 03:26:08.100
I broke time to get the cardboard box.

03:26:08.100 --> 03:26:09.100
It happened to me deficit and funny.

03:26:09.100 --> 03:26:11.100
I feel like the game just ends.

03:26:12.100 --> 03:26:13.100
That's not what I meant.

03:26:13.100 --> 03:26:15.100
I really am interested.

03:26:15.100 --> 03:26:16.100
Oh, really?

03:26:16.100 --> 03:26:18.100
That's no fun.

03:26:18.100 --> 03:26:19.100
Don't you think I'm charming?

03:26:19.100 --> 03:26:20.100
No.

03:26:20.100 --> 03:26:22.100
I mean, of course I do.

03:26:22.100 --> 03:26:31.100
I wouldn't come and come and come and come and get really nice online pictures.

03:26:32.100 --> 03:26:34.100
I really like your Facebook page.

03:26:35.100 --> 03:26:37.100
I wouldn't come and see you if I didn't.

03:26:38.100 --> 03:26:40.100
It's funny that you think that.

03:26:41.100 --> 03:26:43.100
It doesn't even hurt my pictures.

03:26:43.100 --> 03:26:47.100
It's so funny that it's actually a little embarrassing.

03:26:48.100 --> 03:26:50.100
Thanks.

03:26:50.100 --> 03:26:51.100
Thanks, though.

03:26:51.100 --> 03:26:53.100
Those pictures are so embarrassing.

03:26:53.100 --> 03:26:59.100
Sometimes what freaks me out is the dialogue that I'm dubbing and making up makes sense for their responses.

03:26:59.100 --> 03:27:01.100
She's like, it's so embarrassing.

03:27:01.100 --> 03:27:07.100
Like, as if she was an actual fucking line.

03:27:09.100 --> 03:27:11.100
It's so funny.

03:27:12.100 --> 03:27:16.100
Thanks, though.

03:27:16.100 --> 03:27:19.100
Did you like the bikini ones?

03:27:19.100 --> 03:27:22.100
I mean, anyway, you want us to know about my days off?

03:27:22.100 --> 03:27:23.100
Let's spin this around.

03:27:23.100 --> 03:27:25.100
What do you think I do?

03:27:26.100 --> 03:27:28.100
I feel like you go out shopping.

03:27:28.100 --> 03:27:30.100
Go out shopping for clothes.

03:27:30.100 --> 03:27:31.100
Sorry.

03:27:31.100 --> 03:27:33.100
Go out shopping for clothes and stuff.

03:27:33.100 --> 03:27:34.100
Too bad.

03:27:34.100 --> 03:27:36.100
I'd like to shop, but I have no money.

03:27:37.100 --> 03:27:38.100
Wow.

03:27:38.100 --> 03:27:40.100
She's me for real for real.

03:27:40.100 --> 03:27:43.100
So that's why I whore myself out in this bunny garden.

03:27:43.100 --> 03:27:47.100
Please, can you please take the offer for the threesome?

03:27:47.100 --> 03:27:49.100
I'm giving you a discount.

03:27:49.100 --> 03:27:52.100
It's only $150.

03:27:53.100 --> 03:27:55.100
Most of the time, it's $300.

03:27:55.100 --> 03:27:57.100
You get two for the price of one.

03:27:57.100 --> 03:27:58.100
Okay?

03:27:58.100 --> 03:28:00.100
I'm not interested.

03:28:00.100 --> 03:28:02.100
Whatever.

03:28:02.100 --> 03:28:03.100
I went to a shop.

03:28:03.100 --> 03:28:06.100
I wait until I find something I really want.

03:28:06.100 --> 03:28:08.100
Then I buy it.

03:28:08.100 --> 03:28:10.100
Buy home money.

03:28:13.100 --> 03:28:15.100
She's planning something.

03:28:15.100 --> 03:28:18.100
I went to karaoke in front of the station by myself last weekend.

03:28:18.100 --> 03:28:21.100
I sang nothing but the songs I wanted to sing myself.

03:28:21.100 --> 03:28:23.100
Doesn't everybody fucking do that?

03:28:25.100 --> 03:28:29.100
I guess you try to pick songs that everyone knows when you go with friends.

03:28:32.100 --> 03:28:34.100
Oh, that Tito's came back up.

03:28:34.100 --> 03:28:35.100
Oh.

03:28:35.100 --> 03:28:38.100
Then I mention it as a reflux when I have vodka.

03:28:40.100 --> 03:28:41.100
Yeah.

03:28:41.100 --> 03:28:42.100
I like hearing people sing.

03:28:42.100 --> 03:28:44.100
So going with friends is fun too.

03:28:44.100 --> 03:28:46.100
Mostly I just go by myself.

03:28:46.100 --> 03:28:48.100
Because my friends are in my head.

03:28:48.100 --> 03:28:50.100
They're talpas.

03:28:51.100 --> 03:28:53.100
Shut up, Jeff.

03:28:53.100 --> 03:28:56.100
Last weekend, I wanted to sing a blow-off scene.

03:28:57.100 --> 03:28:59.100
What did you do last weekend, Hai Chen?

03:28:59.100 --> 03:29:01.100
Or are you making out with girls maybe?

03:29:01.100 --> 03:29:02.100
Whoa!

03:29:02.100 --> 03:29:05.100
Slow your fucking roll, medium but premium.

03:29:05.100 --> 03:29:06.100
Okay?

03:29:06.100 --> 03:29:08.100
I was gambling.

03:29:08.100 --> 03:29:10.100
Daddy gotta make that money.

03:29:11.100 --> 03:29:12.100
Obviously not.

03:29:12.100 --> 03:29:15.100
I don't even know anyone who'd want to.

03:29:15.100 --> 03:29:17.100
I'm a fucking loser.

03:29:18.100 --> 03:29:19.100
Oh yeah.

03:29:19.100 --> 03:29:21.100
I guess you need two willing participants for that.

03:29:21.100 --> 03:29:23.100
Like me and one of the other girls.

03:29:23.100 --> 03:29:25.100
Four or three some.

03:29:25.100 --> 03:29:28.100
All you have to do is pay me $150.

03:29:29.100 --> 03:29:31.100
Well then, why don't I act as your partner?

03:29:31.100 --> 03:29:33.100
Are you gonna make out with me?

03:29:34.100 --> 03:29:35.100
What?

03:29:35.100 --> 03:29:36.100
Here.

03:29:36.100 --> 03:29:37.100
I'll blow you a kiss.

03:29:41.100 --> 03:29:43.100
That's all for now.

03:29:43.100 --> 03:29:45.100
So hang in there, okay?

03:29:46.100 --> 03:29:47.100
Wait, wait, wait.

03:29:47.100 --> 03:29:48.100
She's zipper.

03:29:51.100 --> 03:29:53.100
Hey, Chloe, can you get a rag?

03:29:53.100 --> 03:29:55.100
Yeah, this one just popped.

03:29:55.100 --> 03:29:56.100
Yeah, thank you.

03:29:56.100 --> 03:29:57.100
Thank you.

03:29:58.100 --> 03:29:59.100
Hai Chen, how about drinks?

03:29:59.100 --> 03:30:00.100
Do you want a bit more?

03:30:00.100 --> 03:30:02.100
Should I get you something?

03:30:05.100 --> 03:30:07.100
No, I don't have any money.

03:30:10.100 --> 03:30:11.100
Cheers to my pants.

03:30:11.100 --> 03:30:13.100
Cheers in my pants.

03:30:13.100 --> 03:30:15.100
I don't relax.

03:30:17.100 --> 03:30:19.100
I'm sitting at the checkout line.

03:30:24.100 --> 03:30:26.100
Wow, is it already this late?

03:30:26.100 --> 03:30:28.100
I'll head back home.

03:30:31.100 --> 03:30:33.100
Please come again.

03:30:33.100 --> 03:30:34.100
I'll be waiting.

03:30:34.100 --> 03:30:36.100
Yeah, thank you for today.

03:30:41.100 --> 03:30:43.100
I'm gonna gamble.

03:30:46.100 --> 03:30:48.100
I should have saved.

03:30:56.100 --> 03:30:58.100
Yeah.

03:30:58.100 --> 03:31:01.100
Okay, I'm gonna save and then I'm gonna keep gambling

03:31:01.100 --> 03:31:04.100
because I want to see, like, because I feel like

03:31:04.100 --> 03:31:06.100
it's gonna be very forgiving

03:31:08.100 --> 03:31:11.100
when you try to gamble with a low amount.

03:31:13.100 --> 03:31:15.100
Open the window and a breeze rolls in.

03:31:15.100 --> 03:31:18.100
Cheers in my pants.

03:31:19.100 --> 03:31:20.100
It's barely enough for the bill.

03:31:20.100 --> 03:31:21.100
I was fine.

03:31:23.100 --> 03:31:25.100
See, it doesn't do that much.

03:31:26.100 --> 03:31:28.100
300 yen is about, like, fucking five bucks.

03:31:30.100 --> 03:31:33.100
And I win, like, 50K yen because I'd be sick.

03:31:38.100 --> 03:31:40.100
That works for me.

03:31:42.100 --> 03:31:45.100
I want me to buy one of the girls.

03:31:48.100 --> 03:31:51.100
I'll use all my money to buy them a fucking toy.

03:31:52.100 --> 03:31:55.100
Oh, wait, I realized that I could have gotten, like, a make-up set.

03:31:55.100 --> 03:31:57.100
It's fine.

03:31:57.100 --> 03:31:59.100
Then we're gonna save.

03:32:04.100 --> 03:32:06.100
And then we're gonna gamble.

03:32:11.100 --> 03:32:13.100
I gotta make the money for the girlies.

03:32:13.100 --> 03:32:15.100
I need to treat them, you know?

03:32:16.100 --> 03:32:18.100
You know, it's called gamble heaven.

03:32:22.100 --> 03:32:25.100
Let's fucking go. Let's keep going. Let's keep going. Let's keep going.

03:32:26.100 --> 03:32:28.100
What are macaroons? They're really tasty.

03:32:28.100 --> 03:32:30.100
I really don't know how to explain it, like, it's like a type of...

03:32:30.100 --> 03:32:32.100
Is it a pastry? I don't know.

03:32:32.100 --> 03:32:34.100
They're really tasty, though.

03:32:34.100 --> 03:32:36.100
I like macaroons.

03:32:36.100 --> 03:32:37.100
Oh, yeah!

03:32:37.100 --> 03:32:40.100
Again, hit me, hit me, hit me.

03:32:42.100 --> 03:32:44.100
Dealer, hit me, hit.

03:32:45.100 --> 03:32:47.100
Smash the like button.

03:32:47.100 --> 03:32:50.100
And subscribe below and check out my merch in my description.

03:32:50.100 --> 03:32:52.100
Oh, fuck.

03:33:00.100 --> 03:33:03.100
You guys can't see, but I'm doing the orange justice dance to the music.

03:33:06.100 --> 03:33:09.100
All right, let's gamble.

03:33:12.100 --> 03:33:14.100
Wait, they'll still let me gamble when I have no money?

03:33:16.100 --> 03:33:18.100
How does that work?

03:33:19.100 --> 03:33:21.100
All right, sorry, I sold one of you guys.

03:33:23.100 --> 03:33:25.100
Oh, we're fine! See, we're fine.

03:33:30.100 --> 03:33:32.100
I don't know how that works, but, you know...

03:33:33.100 --> 03:33:35.100
Now's my time to rest up and recover.

03:33:36.100 --> 03:33:38.100
This is the only place I can heal my mind.

03:33:40.100 --> 03:33:42.100
I need my dick sucked.

03:33:44.100 --> 03:33:46.100
Good morning!

03:33:46.100 --> 03:33:47.100
Whoa, bitch!

03:33:47.100 --> 03:33:49.100
Oh, you came. Thanks.

03:33:50.100 --> 03:33:52.100
What drink did you want?

03:33:52.100 --> 03:33:54.100
Uh, I'll just have a custard.

03:33:55.100 --> 03:33:57.100
Can I have some, too?

03:33:57.100 --> 03:33:58.100
No.

03:33:58.100 --> 03:34:00.100
Give me Blue Girl.

03:34:00.100 --> 03:34:02.100
I like how she looks like she's gonna cry every time I say no.

03:34:02.100 --> 03:34:04.100
Okay, perfect. Blue Girl's coming.

03:34:04.100 --> 03:34:06.100
Oh, they have cute little bunny things.

03:34:06.100 --> 03:34:08.100
I like how she moonwalks in place.

03:34:09.100 --> 03:34:12.100
Hey, I already forgot your name, but I started with an M.

03:34:12.100 --> 03:34:14.100
Um, I got you.

03:34:14.100 --> 03:34:16.100
Bunny.

03:34:16.100 --> 03:34:18.100
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

03:34:18.100 --> 03:34:20.100
I hope you like it.

03:34:20.100 --> 03:34:24.100
It's, like, just the perfect size for humping.

03:34:26.100 --> 03:34:28.100
Looks at you.

03:34:28.100 --> 03:34:30.100
Really? Oh, thanks.

03:34:30.100 --> 03:34:32.100
I've never really tried that before.

03:34:32.100 --> 03:34:34.100
I was just plain happy.

03:34:36.100 --> 03:34:37.100
What?

03:34:38.100 --> 03:34:41.100
Hmm, should I hump the bunny?

03:34:41.100 --> 03:34:43.100
Hmm.

03:34:43.100 --> 03:34:46.100
Uh, sure, what's up?

03:34:46.100 --> 03:34:48.100
You got fired.

03:34:48.100 --> 03:34:50.100
No fucking shit!

03:34:50.100 --> 03:34:52.100
I didn't mean to remind you.

03:34:55.100 --> 03:34:57.100
Yeah, I did.

03:34:57.100 --> 03:34:59.100
You're not gonna let that go, huh?

03:35:00.100 --> 03:35:02.100
I'm sorry. What was your name again?

03:35:04.100 --> 03:35:07.100
I'm actually hurt. I shouldn't have given you that fucking bunny.

03:35:11.100 --> 03:35:13.100
She is so cold, but I love her.

03:35:15.100 --> 03:35:17.100
She's better than the other two girls.

03:35:18.100 --> 03:35:20.100
I know, Kanda.

03:35:20.100 --> 03:35:22.100
I know, right. I know.

03:35:22.100 --> 03:35:25.100
I know, right. I know.

03:35:25.100 --> 03:35:27.100
So you are an android.

03:35:27.100 --> 03:35:29.100
You're back again.

03:35:29.100 --> 03:35:32.100
Take a girl out to dinner first, won't you?

03:35:32.100 --> 03:35:35.100
Thank you.

03:35:35.100 --> 03:35:37.100
Gambling fund.

03:35:37.100 --> 03:35:39.100
Gambling fund?

03:35:40.100 --> 03:35:42.100
Thank you, Eternity.

03:35:44.100 --> 03:35:47.100
I came to see you, Mewkuchen.

03:35:48.100 --> 03:35:50.100
Ew, gross.

03:35:50.100 --> 03:35:52.100
Please leave.

03:35:52.100 --> 03:35:55.100
Is there another customer that needs to work with me, Debra? No?

03:35:55.100 --> 03:35:57.100
None of my regulars are here?

03:35:57.100 --> 03:35:58.100
Oh, fine.

03:35:58.100 --> 03:36:00.100
Oh, hi-dote.

03:36:00.100 --> 03:36:02.100
You're a strange one.

03:36:02.100 --> 03:36:05.100
You must be low on money, though.

03:36:06.100 --> 03:36:08.100
Oh, I...

03:36:08.100 --> 03:36:10.100
Damn.

03:36:10.100 --> 03:36:12.100
Jesus fuck.

03:36:13.100 --> 03:36:15.100
She is tearing me apart.

03:36:17.100 --> 03:36:20.100
I'm helping out my friend now, so it's okay.

03:36:20.100 --> 03:36:22.100
You don't have to worry about that.

03:36:22.100 --> 03:36:24.100
I'm not worried.

03:36:24.100 --> 03:36:26.100
Honestly, I don't care.

03:36:26.100 --> 03:36:28.100
Oh, okay.

03:36:28.100 --> 03:36:33.100
She's just so unbothered.

03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:38.100
She only works this job just to insult her patrons.

03:36:38.100 --> 03:36:40.100
She makes plenty of money.

03:36:40.100 --> 03:36:42.100
She's like a trust fund baby.

03:36:42.100 --> 03:36:45.100
She just comes here because she has a sick, twisted pleasure

03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:49.100
of just acting disinterested and insulting her clients.

03:36:49.100 --> 03:36:51.100
She's just so unbothered.

03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:54.100
She only works this job just to insult her patrons.

03:36:54.100 --> 03:36:56.100
She makes plenty of money.

03:36:57.100 --> 03:37:00.100
You must spend your money wisely.

03:37:00.100 --> 03:37:03.100
Do you know that I was gambling?

03:37:03.100 --> 03:37:05.100
It's necessary.

03:37:05.100 --> 03:37:08.100
Does she fucking know?

03:37:08.100 --> 03:37:09.100
She must fucking know.

03:37:09.100 --> 03:37:10.100
They must know.

03:37:10.100 --> 03:37:13.100
The bots must know that when you hit a certain like below

03:37:13.100 --> 03:37:15.100
and you're in a hole, they probably are like,

03:37:15.100 --> 03:37:18.100
hey, man, stop gambling.

03:37:18.100 --> 03:37:22.100
Yeah, I'll make sure to do that.

03:37:22.100 --> 03:37:28.100
Sorry, I burped in my mouth.

03:37:28.100 --> 03:37:29.100
Gross.

03:37:29.100 --> 03:37:33.100
But thanks for coming here to spend that important money with me.

03:37:33.100 --> 03:37:35.100
Because I deserve it and you don't.

03:37:35.100 --> 03:37:37.100
Hand it over.

03:37:37.100 --> 03:37:41.100
It feels strange to say you're welcome after that.

03:37:41.100 --> 03:37:48.100
I keep getting acid reflux from the alcohol.

03:37:48.100 --> 03:37:50.100
Ha, ha.

03:37:50.100 --> 03:37:52.100
That was a really fake laugh.

03:37:52.100 --> 03:37:54.100
It wasn't.

03:37:54.100 --> 03:37:55.100
This is my fake laugh.

I'll probably play Hoonipop and I'll probably do a similar thing to this where I voice all the characters

03:48:40.860 --> 03:48:43.940
And we get all the fun special stuff. So

03:48:44.700 --> 03:48:46.460

Surprised she just comes here for fun to insult people

03:49:23.260 --> 03:49:32.020
What's the issue because of the way I am is it because you're not good at making small talk in your vat at serving customers

03:49:34.580 --> 03:49:37.180
Dude what the fuck you have to say that

03:49:41.020 --> 03:49:44.500

But you're an idiot. I hate you. Don't ever come again

03:49:49.100 --> 03:49:52.900

Uh, yeah, I do the work I'm doing is all through a connection with my friend

03:52:15.720 --> 03:52:18.560
That my parents totally didn't pay to be friends with me

03:52:19.480 --> 03:52:23.760
You do have friends. That's unexpected. You kind of seem like a loser

03:52:24.600 --> 03:52:25.840
Damn

03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:28.880
You have to be so harsh. Why is that so surprising?

03:52:30.080 --> 03:52:37.880
You're the type of guy who gets fired. I figured might make a mess with friendships as well. Jesus. Why is she cooking me?

03:52:39.880 --> 03:52:41.880

03:57:55.480 --> 03:57:57.480
