WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
He's not happy with me, you know.

00:04.720 --> 00:07.760
Yeah, I'm the life on, what life on that could be?

00:09.440 --> 00:12.560
All right, I need to get a chance screen. I need to get a chance screen.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.280
Why is my iPhone, whoa, my iPhone bugging the fuck? Oh, relax. What? I'm bugging out.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.360
Am I getting a challenge screen? Get a challenge screen. No.

00:27.840 --> 00:33.520
No, hold on, hold on, hold on. Scuffs already started, boys. Scuffs already started.

00:33.520 --> 00:38.640
Look, he's a, he's the same, he's the same. One man, one mop. I was there, doing some,

00:39.520 --> 00:46.640
some business things. God, the frickin scuff is a thing. What the hell's going on?

00:48.960 --> 00:56.160
The tracker is hating me right now. Can you hear me? Have you all seen this? Have you all heard

00:56.160 --> 01:03.200
about this? Okay, I think I'm gonna have to move the iPhone about because what the actual heck.

01:03.200 --> 01:08.800
Can you guys hear the background music? I'm new. Okay, you can now. You can hear a bit of Assassin's

01:08.800 --> 01:18.320
Creed. Good morning. My iPhone is bugging out right as a, I'm pretty sure this can do horizontal,

01:18.320 --> 01:24.480
so not sure why I'm going to absolutely not hold on. I'm just calibrating, testing, left.

01:25.280 --> 01:32.880
No, what the heck? Can you not see my face? Sorry. Blame the technology. What's that? I

01:32.880 --> 01:39.200
should have used my loading screen. Sorry, can't relate. Couldn't care less. And something, something.

01:39.200 --> 01:47.040
Oh my God. Is it because it's dark in this room? I can't believe it. I can't believe being a goblin

01:47.040 --> 01:53.600
in the dark is a terrible idea for freaking tracking reasons. Hold on, hold on, I need to

01:53.600 --> 02:03.120
come literally on my hands and knees to plug in this light under my PC. This is nonsense. Honestly,

02:03.120 --> 02:11.120
why can't you see me iPhone? I'm out of the port? There are no keys. Oh my God.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.800
All right, anyway, I've got some good news.

02:16.720 --> 02:23.680
Well, the good news is I've got my first ASMR club coming out. Right, I've got to lay on.

02:23.680 --> 02:27.200
Right, I've got to lay on. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Right, back and back

02:27.520 --> 02:34.720
Yeah, that's snuffing those. Why? Can, can be chip studio not handle?

02:42.240 --> 02:46.720
Why is that going? Right, I don't think the chip studio works at all horizontal. Fuck you.

02:47.360 --> 02:54.960
You stupid little twat. First of all, you little prick. Can it hunt? Can it know it can't go horizontal?

02:55.520 --> 02:59.520
I'm confused, but I'm ready. You know what? Fuck it. We're just jumping in. I'll,

02:59.520 --> 03:05.280
I'll deal with the tracking issues once. Hold on, hold on.

03:08.720 --> 03:12.320
Fuck it. There we go. I'm actually normal. I don't know why the track and bugging.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.680
I'm covering up too much on the screen now.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.600
Who's ready for someone's house and screen now? I do believe ASECLE is still streaming,

03:23.600 --> 03:34.560
so please do support ASECLE. She's still streaming for a white Christmas.

03:37.040 --> 03:42.400
Let me just check before we jump into that. I need to make sure I've got suit titles on,

03:42.400 --> 03:49.280
spoken language, English subtitles on. Oh my God, I'm such a real gamer. Are you ready?

03:50.240 --> 03:54.720
ASEA is just ending. Oh, does she be next? I think she'd be moving on.

03:57.520 --> 04:06.240
Her God's EPS soldier. Yeah. Right, okay. Oh, actually, this is some, oh wait, no.

04:09.200 --> 04:17.920
I did all my latest, like, tipper and all that if you did a donor link to me.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.160
Oh, no. Oh, you know what? Fuck it. We're playing Assassin's Creed, man. Fuck the money. I want to

04:22.160 --> 04:28.000
play Assassin's Creed. I wanted to say something. I don't know if you guys would like this, but

04:28.000 --> 04:32.880
whenever we play a video game, obviously there's names in the video game, and it's rude for a

04:32.880 --> 04:38.240
feature, but to like name people and chat. So I want it to be like special congratulations

04:38.240 --> 04:43.200
if your name's Desmond, if your name is Sean, if your name's Rebecca, if your name's Lucy,

04:43.200 --> 04:48.960
if your name's Ezio, like, in the video game. I don't know, like, maybe only the guy names

04:48.960 --> 04:55.360
make sense, but I thought that would be a bit different. Um, yeah, special show if your name's

04:55.360 --> 05:02.640
Desmond. Uh, wait, that's right, you get a name by me. Eh, there we go. Eh, Desmond, that's right,

05:02.640 --> 05:07.760
your name is Desmond. Okay. I don't think anyone ever expects to wake up one morning and find

05:07.760 --> 05:14.160
themselves caught in the middle of a war between two secret organizations. I know I did, but here

05:14.160 --> 05:19.600
I am on one side of the world. Can you guys hear the game? Better known these days as exturgo

05:19.600 --> 05:27.280
industries. We're in the business of control, politics, economics, technology. I school hope

05:27.280 --> 05:31.920
you enjoyed your, uh, Tomb Raider, more like Whim Raider after I'm done with you.

05:38.640 --> 05:43.680

05:46.880 --> 05:51.440

05:53.040 --> 05:56.480

09:04.280 --> 09:06.960
victory

09:10.360 --> 09:15.160
this is my favorite bet cuz they always glitches out the fabric always glitches

09:15.160 --> 09:17.560
out on his knee in the scene it doesn't matter how many times you play through

09:17.560 --> 09:21.000
this game like it is instance of new glitches gonna occur during the cut scenes

09:21.000 --> 09:25.080
but it always glitches out on the knee at that cut scene to the matter how many

09:25.080 --> 09:31.440
times you play it Mario what are you doing here better to be left in the hands

09:31.440 --> 09:38.120
of the earth than in the hands of man I can't believe the Pope fucking vanished

09:38.120 --> 09:48.960
where's that bloody popcorn sorry I'm drinking and then it makes me do hypnosis

09:48.960 --> 09:51.960
I'll just get so excited okay

09:52.480 --> 09:59.960
I'll be swallowed alive as a giant test for it's already occurring

10:04.840 --> 10:08.800
are we ready are we ready are we ready for the best freaking voice line for

10:08.800 --> 10:18.280
Mario it's such a good freaking quote

10:18.280 --> 10:27.240
it's an entire area I was worried quick we have to get out of here okay so you

10:27.240 --> 10:31.400
can actually jump up if you do not engage an eagle vision so we're already in

10:31.400 --> 10:35.280
tutorial mode if you do not engage an eagle eagle vision the game will not let

10:35.280 --> 10:41.160
you climb up at all and but until you engage it so we're playing it's your

10:41.160 --> 10:46.440
auditorita friends it which means he was spawned in frenzy we are already an

10:46.440 --> 10:51.880
established assassin okay we've just defeated the big bad evil and assassin

10:51.880 --> 10:55.120
screen too I'll shut up

11:07.240 --> 11:12.600
oh my god right okay and so yeah we're Italian so Baba the boopie all those

11:12.600 --> 11:17.640
jokes this up next part section so we're still in tutorial mode obviously the game

11:17.640 --> 11:21.040
but the reason why I want to mention that we're in tutorial mode is because the

11:21.040 --> 11:26.160
game perfectly is structured

11:35.120 --> 11:40.000
oh that's another good like you can damn what you do not understand now right so

11:40.000 --> 11:44.480
we can push people out the way it my way it my way it my way rosary beats up your

11:44.480 --> 11:49.120
arse leave me alone away you go Mario will actually get caught on those people

11:49.120 --> 11:58.320
which is quite funny that's your uncle Mario my arm is attacked now I want

11:58.320 --> 12:04.720
you to remember that pineapple for no reason at all remember the pineapple all

12:04.720 --> 12:11.120
hail the pineapple all hail the pineapple okay this next section is how you get

12:11.120 --> 12:14.720
one of the easiest achievements in the game and it is perfectly sequence for

12:14.720 --> 12:20.480
you to do so so look alive this is how you get the you haven't you're not to get

12:20.480 --> 12:23.520
hit you're not to get hit oh shit he knocked them over right hold on you

12:23.520 --> 12:29.000
wait for them to attack and then if you perfectly execute all these men then you

12:29.000 --> 12:34.280
get your first achievement which I believe is frenzy but if you do it

12:34.280 --> 12:40.400
perfectly Mario shouldn't unfortunately the camera angles are a bit no I lost

12:40.560 --> 12:46.400
the street because of the freaking camera angle anyway your first achievement is to

12:46.400 --> 12:49.760
kill 10 people in a row you could easily do it at that section of the game but

12:49.760 --> 12:53.920
don't worry if you miss it there are many opportunities to do so the camera

12:53.920 --> 12:59.440
angle will make mess you up I was gonna say make you up

12:59.440 --> 13:03.440
and the camera angles a bit funny especially when you're in between

13:03.440 --> 13:08.240
buildings like it's telling me to follow Mario you must also trail behind

13:08.240 --> 13:12.640
Mario a couple of meters if you are right behind him you will knock him off

13:12.640 --> 13:17.040
his coded path the AI will fix itself and he will go back on the path but you

13:17.040 --> 13:20.960
must give him space or you will knock him off the rooftops and then you have to

13:20.960 --> 13:25.200
wait even longer for this section to occur but it's fine it's not bad section

13:25.200 --> 13:30.720
this is to learn mostly rooftop moving about how to get your agility sorted

13:30.720 --> 13:34.960
you can't get used to holding down I recommend oh see that's another thing

13:34.960 --> 13:38.400
sometimes it say we will do something when you tell him to jump in a certain

13:38.400 --> 13:42.320
direction it's fine this game has aged beautifully

13:42.320 --> 13:54.560
and I believe this game came out 2012 Skyrim was 2011 again you can knock Mario

13:54.560 --> 13:58.320
off this if you're too quick you must be careful

13:58.320 --> 14:06.160
it was 2010 oh my god I was a baby I remember asking my dad for this game

14:06.160 --> 14:12.000
and um fun fact my dad bought me the special edition sasa's crude brotherhood

14:12.000 --> 14:17.280
and it came in a special box and if you opened it up I had the sasa's

14:17.280 --> 14:22.320
a logo on it and you opened up the box and the game like pops up and presents

14:22.320 --> 14:26.480
itself man it was freaking good here's another section if you if I

14:26.480 --> 14:30.080
continue up he does not move are you ready for this I'm gonna

14:30.080 --> 14:35.920
oh no like you can't progress like you have to go to the side he is in a wall

14:35.920 --> 14:39.120
right now in the tutorial phase

14:41.920 --> 14:45.760

14:45.760 --> 14:49.440

27:37.440 --> 27:38.880
i'll read it after the sections

27:39.840 --> 27:44.640
that is the future i can't believe it there'd be it too can i tell you a sad story i actually

27:44.640 --> 27:52.000
really cried like i cried squiddin me right now eh right i'll read the the random italian

27:52.000 --> 28:00.000
this person thinks i could think i can say ciao mio caro eraro verdre uno così belle

28:00.240 --> 28:12.800
e cosi te lantoso for se puiowni i se gnarami la tua bellissima lingua thank you for listening

28:12.800 --> 28:22.160
to my italian well i gotta give to compliment again on your heart love the accent by the way

28:22.160 --> 28:29.040
how many times did you play the game to know it so well um the answer is uh i actually couldn't

28:29.040 --> 28:35.280
even count how many times i've played this game i love you know anything killing us is that breath

28:39.520 --> 28:40.320
take a drink of war

28:44.160 --> 28:48.800
did you saw my mother in italian okay one of my biggest pet peeves about this game

28:49.680 --> 28:55.040
the freaking cannons so you see how the hit markers there it looks like you're gonna hit it

28:55.040 --> 29:00.960
and the cannons are like way loud in this game they're like far too loud they're insanely loud

29:03.760 --> 29:13.200
foul-ass breath the guy sounds like a skyrim god most video games reuse uh voice actors so you

29:13.200 --> 29:18.880
will recognize people over and over again it's very common if you work in a video game that you

29:18.880 --> 29:25.760
will be used for mbc's for example um are just miscellaneous characters all the time very common

29:25.760 --> 29:31.600
skyrim is probably the biggest example of like the same seven voice actors being used over and over

29:31.600 --> 29:38.480
again um other than sissuru and skyrim shout out to sissuru and skyrim can't remember the actual

29:38.480 --> 29:46.720
guy's name but goodness greatly he said hi my dear it's rare to see one so beautiful and so talented

29:46.720 --> 29:52.560
maybe you can teach me a beautiful laugh wait you can't even speak english and you like my accent

29:52.560 --> 29:59.680
bro you're gonna be in for a shot come on my favorite oblivion line oh let me retake that

29:59.680 --> 30:03.520
let me redo that and they left it in the game okay we have now just finished all our three

30:03.520 --> 30:08.560
side missions we have just handled the cannons hmm suspicious i wonder why we have also been

30:08.560 --> 30:15.120
able to ride a horse that's because in later parts of the game horse riding is very uh necessary

30:15.200 --> 30:21.520
to explore certain locations um it's just not possible on foot it is partly you can do it but

30:21.520 --> 30:27.120
it just takes up so much time um and we also helped the lady which established that itseo

30:27.120 --> 30:33.200
adetori is a bit of a bit of a ladies man and he's out for ladies holes i mean we're all out

30:33.200 --> 30:39.120
for the ladies hole at the end of the day aren't we lads hey hope this is outrageous

30:40.080 --> 30:43.200
by zura by zura by zura

30:45.680 --> 30:50.960
there are two major uh hubs of english voice actors the pill from the pleasure of your presence

30:50.960 --> 30:59.440
so this is katarina sports uh she is a real person uh did occur your mercenary a very badass

30:59.440 --> 31:04.240
personality is likely that i can give you what you see based on a real person but we will talk later

31:04.560 --> 31:11.040
we're like katarina do fanny and because we're getting her last hair once so far

31:12.080 --> 31:18.080
that's her mummy mummy that's marquia velly recurring character

31:24.160 --> 31:28.080
i wish i could show you the magic she performed very good line

31:34.800 --> 31:38.080
there the moving painting of the goddess minerva spoke

31:39.360 --> 31:42.400
told of a terrible tragedy to befall mankind in the future

31:43.360 --> 31:49.520
but gave hope of lost temples that will provide aid to humanity and then she called out to a

31:49.520 --> 31:58.000
phantom desmond as if he were there who's dead beside her after her warning she vanished

31:58.960 --> 32:05.840
amazing i cannot imagine such wonders the vault did not house the terrible weapon fear

32:06.720 --> 32:13.920
this is good news what about this goddess this minerva did she appear human yes but her words

32:13.920 --> 32:21.120
proved otherwise all of her kind died many years ago i wish i could show you the magic she performed

32:21.200 --> 32:30.240
oh that was a good delivery good delivery

32:41.520 --> 32:44.240
the script pulled off another one i got you pulled up another one

32:44.480 --> 32:51.760
i'm surprised she remains so composed just watching the mirror on her the spaniards lives

32:55.920 --> 33:03.280
some of the voicelines are a bit goofy you should have killed you we're sure to suffer for it i'm not

33:03.280 --> 33:13.200
here to debate the past together we should discuss the future no i am leaving me

33:13.360 --> 33:16.720
i do not know why you spared him but i trust your judgment

33:16.720 --> 33:18.640
damn straight you do uncle mario here real one

33:21.120 --> 33:22.400
that's me uncle mario

33:28.320 --> 33:35.760
mario maria auditory that's your mummy big mummykins did you know actually that's a bit sad

33:35.760 --> 33:41.600
maybe not we'll just continue to the next part of the sequence oh right ready everyone group

33:41.600 --> 33:52.000
session right now everyone get it out not for this bit the bit that follows after hold on

33:56.560 --> 34:01.280
wait for it wait for it see this is what happens when you pay for the premium pass at the violour

34:01.280 --> 34:06.080
meet and greet booth you're presented with a bathtub and then this part is me that's you

34:06.080 --> 34:08.080
okay that's you in the bathtub this next bit is me

34:13.200 --> 34:16.160
all this for a hundred dollars for the premium pass yes please

34:17.680 --> 34:24.800
coming at you my bikini welcome home reflin in my accent obviously i'll have to like really

34:24.880 --> 34:31.520
put on that accent welcome home reflin mom is misty

34:44.400 --> 34:49.120
do you think a con would let us have a meet a booth that would be hilarious

34:50.080 --> 34:56.000
oh i forgot about that part of the scene oh oh like what happens in the asmr booth stays in the

34:56.000 --> 35:04.720
asmr booth everyone's okay everyone's uh fun fact i played this game in front of my mum and she was

35:04.720 --> 35:10.320
mortified at this scene because i was very very young uh and i remember playing it at midnight

35:10.320 --> 35:15.280
and i had the dining room chair in front of the tv my mom let me play it on the big tv

35:16.240 --> 35:24.800
uh and she was like what are you playing i'm like it's a sapis grade mom please i didn't make the game

35:28.000 --> 35:32.800
one should always have the freedom to choose oh so salty so salty

35:33.520 --> 35:38.960
so what's that probably just training exercises

35:41.840 --> 35:45.280
yeah damn training exercises out of control

35:48.320 --> 35:51.280
i have to find mario and rally putting the ass in the size

35:55.040 --> 35:59.600
actually that's another side note i can't remember why my dad needed to spell

35:59.600 --> 36:02.880
oh i was telling my dad about like some of my favorite games of all time like a couple of years

36:02.880 --> 36:07.040
back now he was like how do you spell assassin i was like ass ass in and we both looked at each

36:07.040 --> 36:14.480
other like that shrek meme like like burst out laughing such children honestly

36:20.000 --> 36:24.880
i'm not i'm not gonna lie if i felt like that my ankles would be gone they would be dust

36:25.600 --> 36:33.200
okay this is the worst part of the game that's about to come up because you can

36:33.200 --> 36:35.280
do everything right and the game will still fail you

36:38.000 --> 36:41.200
so mario has the apple of eden piece of eden

36:41.520 --> 36:43.520
away

36:50.960 --> 36:55.760
the one italian like oh my god she really likes assassins my goodness

36:58.240 --> 37:03.600
to say helping uh oh no we lost our monies it's not about the money money money

37:04.560 --> 37:07.040
forget about the money money money

37:08.560 --> 37:13.200
you do not actually have to do anything the horse will automatically run for you in this sequence

37:20.560 --> 37:24.400
so the entire town is now being absolutely destroyed and raided and i'm currently

37:24.480 --> 37:26.320
singing that one scottish song

37:31.600 --> 37:36.720
all the horses get back up in this video game i just for anyone who doesn't like when the horses

37:36.720 --> 37:42.400
go down and with you with that the horses always stand back up in video in this video game no horse

37:42.400 --> 37:48.560
ever stays down even if it's been attacked if it's been hurt lalala okay this is the part i hate

37:48.560 --> 37:54.800
you can destroy all the cannons and all the freaking towns people won't escape and you can

37:54.800 --> 38:00.640
fail this section i have done it consecutively all you have to do is destroy the cannons ignore

38:00.640 --> 38:05.520
everything else but the freaking it's really hard to tell yeah see i should have hit that third one

38:05.520 --> 38:14.640
but it's really hard to tell like with the edges of like the radius your area of effect if you will

38:14.640 --> 38:16.400
and my goodness gravy it's frustrating

38:19.120 --> 38:22.560
no horses were harmed in the production of this video game no they're not so

38:23.120 --> 38:29.600
please don't worry all horses get back up the aoe area of effect it's it's so freaking hard to

38:29.600 --> 38:36.240
tell because you could perfectly angle it and you're like i should have three but yeah and especially

38:36.240 --> 38:43.520
the ones on the hill this oh beautiful beautiful do that again hen do it again do it again do it

38:43.520 --> 38:50.720
again give us three oh baby right so unfortunately you can't really do much more after you've killed

38:50.720 --> 39:01.120
this one boom baby okay next section we've got to do this bit correct because this is where you can

39:01.120 --> 39:08.640
fail the problem with the hill is you have to like judge behind the cannons oh triple baby

39:08.640 --> 39:12.480
let's go three for three obviously we can't do it for this one because it's not third but

39:12.560 --> 39:14.000
we've got three for three so far

39:17.040 --> 39:20.960
okay wait what that one survived hello

39:23.600 --> 39:33.600
excuse me excuse me do my eyes uh so this is the problem you can't really hit those ones

39:33.600 --> 39:37.680
now you might be saying you should hit that big brown thing i've forgotten what their legal name

39:37.680 --> 39:45.200
is uh but the big brown thing doesn't count uh we can kill it we've done what we can so either

39:45.200 --> 39:51.040
we'll fail or we'll win depending on what the game feels like see there's 20 villagers 10 5

39:51.760 --> 39:56.320
we did it we didn't get a balista a siege tower i

39:59.600 --> 40:05.040
soldiers are climbing the walls okay this is one bit i don't like about this game are you ready for

40:06.000 --> 40:12.240
they change your weapons so they've given me a sword i've said uh let me keep my blade out because

40:12.240 --> 40:17.600
i prefer fighting with a blade the only enemies that you're not to go against with the blade

40:17.600 --> 40:25.040
jump down nco jeez yeah my ankles would be disintegrated if i did that um it's much easier

40:25.040 --> 40:31.760
to fight with the blades oh my god he just curbstomped that borja guy did you see that nco

40:31.760 --> 40:41.280
that's a war crime you can't curb stomp people that's not how it works jeez it's the old okay hold on

40:42.320 --> 40:46.080
these enemies oh my god i just got twatted oh i'm getting twat twice sorry i'm too busy

40:46.080 --> 40:52.320
try and be chatting and kill at the same time um no i'm missing oh no everyone gonna know i'm a

40:52.320 --> 41:00.080
terrible gamer um the only enemies that are not effective so like these guys for fuck's sake

41:00.080 --> 41:04.160
they freaking attack before they're supposed to you can break their stance just by spamming

41:04.160 --> 41:08.720
it's not a problem again you for these guys that are double armored up literally take your gun out

41:08.720 --> 41:14.000
boom up it didn't register esio he's getting a bit close mate you're gonna need to aim

41:16.560 --> 41:18.240
that was getting a bit close for comfort

41:20.880 --> 41:26.480
point blank esio that probably wasn't even five meters no been do we need to put glicks on him

41:27.360 --> 41:33.360
oh this is a sad bit

41:40.560 --> 41:41.360
no

41:57.120 --> 42:01.360
this is an invitation my family to yours

42:02.320 --> 42:04.240
to yours

42:21.200 --> 42:27.040
there was a sentence that he said though that your friend this gun that your friend fashioned for

42:27.360 --> 42:34.160
keep that in mind i can walk faster means to stop in italian

42:37.760 --> 42:45.040
so we are now basically running on fumes adrenaline wise we've literally just been

42:45.040 --> 42:52.960
absolutely destroyed we have three bullet wounds i think shoulder uh abdomen oh okay

42:52.960 --> 42:56.320
just to show we've got two bullet wounds i could have sworn it used to be three but

42:56.320 --> 43:02.240
i won't probably just wish me wish me remember being uh but yeah we've literally our liver is

43:02.240 --> 43:10.240
currently bleeding out our kidney most like ow what happened there did you see me get turned

43:10.240 --> 43:19.440
into that rubbish pile i was like liquid did you see that ouch i don't want to be jelly please don't

43:19.440 --> 43:24.720
turn me into jelly hey leaf claudia lonia bam

43:27.280 --> 43:32.320
so you'll get assigned one soldier to kill in the sequence but they all do they all are aggressive

43:32.320 --> 43:39.280
towards you you can clean them up if you really desire but if the arrow is red that means the

43:39.280 --> 43:45.840
ai has assigned to attack you if the arrow is yellow they'll attack oh also the guards have

43:45.920 --> 43:50.880
assassin abilities like how are you sitting on the wall the coding in this game is a bit funny

43:52.160 --> 43:56.480
if you upset NPCs they turn into assassins and start climbing walls and stuff

43:57.440 --> 44:02.400
you could always break a guard's stance with a kick if you are struggling to fight them

44:03.120 --> 44:10.640
but we do get access to long range weaponry very shortly um but yeah uh you can ignore all these

44:11.520 --> 44:16.400
and just go straight in here no you can you have to wait until they're assigned to you okay okay

44:16.400 --> 44:24.640
okay the game does it quite often where it won't let you in if uh someone is target locked onto you

44:26.320 --> 44:30.560
hey come on claudia we ain't got all day jesus we're under a siege take your time hen

44:30.800 --> 44:38.080
it's you i'm in here i will hold the back stop wait for us we thought you had to kill sir etio

44:38.080 --> 44:43.120
not yet where does this passage lead to the north outside the walls are you surprised it exists

44:43.120 --> 44:49.040
i might have to open my door um i must go help the troops my freaking room is getting so hot

44:49.040 --> 44:58.560
with this computer i'm coming so we're currently inside the auditory villa we're now going down

44:58.720 --> 45:04.080
down down down deep inside down deep inside see how do you pick them

45:07.120 --> 45:12.240
i'm sweating um i'm sitting on my sweaty feet right now i don't know how you guys

45:12.240 --> 45:13.840
sit in your chairs but i sit on my feet

45:17.680 --> 45:22.560
we will play assassin's creed 2 because that is a very beautiful section in assassin's creed 2

45:23.120 --> 45:27.440
we're essentially playing assassin's creed 2.5 it's fame brotherhood's good game

45:29.040 --> 45:33.840
right lure lure i'm gonna take a war sip war sipping tin take a sip with me if you don't got war

45:34.400 --> 45:41.600
you must leave this place take mother to parence get me a horse you are not coming with us

45:42.240 --> 45:52.400
where are you riding to roma go my son destroy them but remember for whom we assassinate

45:52.800 --> 45:56.400
the horse was a paid actor

46:00.560 --> 46:04.000
i'm not flexible enough to sit on your feet i'll make you flexible once i've done me

46:05.840 --> 46:06.240
sorry

46:11.920 --> 46:13.200
we're actually speed running

46:14.640 --> 46:18.320
just love this game a little everything about it the patience fantastic we've

46:18.320 --> 46:23.920
completed sequence dna one battle wounds achievement unlocked

46:36.560 --> 46:41.120
i will tell you at the end a very sad fact about that blonde girl you see on the screen right now

46:42.720 --> 46:46.880
but only at the end right so that says in present day

46:49.280 --> 46:57.760
congrats if your name's desmond congrats congrats if your name's shawn shawn's one with glasses

46:57.760 --> 47:03.840
congrats i'm convinced we need to get our hands on etio's apple of edin minerva altered it somehow

47:03.840 --> 47:08.880
when she are they tame traveling where's the autotorizo i will tell you in a second it's our

47:08.880 --> 47:14.000
last safe but we were present day it turns out the templars are watching the border etio hid the

47:14.000 --> 47:21.200
the poe sometime in 1507 but when i try to access that dna sequence he seems to be remembering

47:21.200 --> 47:29.520
something else like a memory inside a memory yes exactly maybe exactly maybe i believe you

47:29.520 --> 47:34.320
experienced something similar if i could have stagger didn't you subject 15 exhibited memory

47:34.320 --> 47:40.240
within memory like patterns but she was pregnant the memories of prego's father and not in this

47:40.800 --> 47:51.840
oh my god we've just been fat shamed in 2024 you guys remember when bao got that model

47:52.640 --> 47:58.480
and she was like inflated and someone was like this is fat shaming it was like no bro that's real

47:58.480 --> 48:00.320
34 open your eyes

48:12.000 --> 48:15.760
legend coming out in inflation model and someone's like you're fat shaming it no more the bugger

48:29.280 --> 48:32.880
they're gonna find us no they aren't come with me

48:48.160 --> 48:51.920
there's a lot of cutscene stuff up ahead but i'll try and for those who don't know the game

48:51.920 --> 48:56.880
i will very quickly summarize from the inside we're not getting in this way what's her next

48:56.880 --> 49:01.760
move the road just moves back into the highway this is not a good place for us to be right now

49:01.760 --> 49:06.000
do we have any tarps we need to cover up the van i really hate to stress this yeah but we are

49:06.000 --> 49:12.720
running out of time that's Sean we'll help us that's Rebecca that's Lucy any ideas i don't know

49:13.360 --> 49:17.200
maybe there's another way into the sanctuary hey i think i've got something

49:17.440 --> 49:26.720
okay so we're modern day Desmond if you don't know the game we basically have a special bloodline

49:27.920 --> 49:34.400
that commutes to the gods that created us and and we use Desmond's DNA sequence in order to go

49:34.400 --> 49:41.200
back in the past very fictional based i absolutely love the concept when i was a child and i wanted

49:41.200 --> 49:49.200
it to be so real i was like take me back to the battle of anaconda take me to big willy walrus

49:50.480 --> 49:51.920
i want to see the construction

50:02.960 --> 50:06.240
so we are like the trunk i'm sorry i don't know what the trunks are

50:06.240 --> 50:12.640
are memories are stored in DNA yes that's the quickest way oh my god me and Lucy

50:26.000 --> 50:28.640
oh yeah you don't have fun you'll have fun with me the night Lucy

50:29.200 --> 50:33.040
okay

50:36.720 --> 50:42.400
okay there we go oh that was a loading screen by the way it looked like it wasn't they were trying

50:42.400 --> 50:50.080
to hide it what was that i don't see anything so Desmond also sees the past because his it's

50:50.080 --> 50:55.440
basically leaking into his present so Lucy can't see any of this we can see this

50:59.200 --> 51:06.480
they escaped through here what that's you and the villagers after the attack i can see them now

51:07.840 --> 51:13.680
i know it's difficult but try to compartmentalize focus on the present what if i can't stop the

51:13.680 --> 51:20.240
visions how long before i start painting symbols on the walls don't joke about that subject 16 had

51:20.240 --> 51:25.520
the bleeding effect that he's talking about and ended up in himself but we learn more about him in

51:25.520 --> 51:26.480
Assassin's Creed 3

51:32.240 --> 51:40.800
well the animus he does turn man please do not refer to the animus that lets us go back into the past

51:40.800 --> 51:41.680
is the animus

51:41.840 --> 51:49.120
oh is it revelation

51:52.640 --> 51:52.960
oh it's

51:54.160 --> 51:59.680
i'll find a way around oh it's revelations you're right sorry my apologies i apologize

52:01.760 --> 52:08.400
i would say this is a revelation do you guys remember dan bull's cover of Assassin's Creed

52:08.400 --> 52:15.680
brotherhood revelations where i meant if you see any remind me not to make you a look out

52:15.680 --> 52:22.400
so we are now backtracking her weight oh sorry more ghosts this is the problem there's so much

52:22.400 --> 52:27.760
dialogue in this game at the start and we are now backtracking trying to get back inside the villa

52:27.760 --> 52:33.600
oh no claudia that's our sister

52:40.480 --> 52:44.800
just joined why is he wearing jeans we're in present day actually yeah could you jump

52:44.800 --> 52:50.000
about in jeans how about you give me a boost i don't even wear jeans i don't even wear clothes

52:50.000 --> 52:55.840
after time actually do you want to guess what clothes i'm wearing right now because it's not

52:55.840 --> 52:58.800
what you think

53:04.560 --> 53:07.600
we are selling tutorials so it's a bit slow but what are you going

53:12.080 --> 53:20.720
um i just wear a bra and a hoodie that's it so my bare arms is on my game and chair right now

53:20.720 --> 53:26.080
with my sweaty feet as well they never stop sweating neither do my hands my hands are very

53:26.080 --> 53:29.760
sweaty right now actually but they don't sweat as much as my feet i'm sorry i don't i don't think i

53:29.760 --> 53:39.360
don't care i'll show up about that oh my marriage oh i have marriage oopsies forgot to talk about

53:39.360 --> 53:43.440
that i have marriage if you want to support me i'm getting key chains with girls and we're i'm

53:43.440 --> 53:55.120
gonna make a little keychain ASMR so the thing about this cut scene you have no health so you

53:55.120 --> 54:00.320
can literally just do that there you can't die in this cut scene in this section of the game

54:01.440 --> 54:05.280
it's not a cut scene it's a section again you can just drop down it doesn't really matter

54:05.280 --> 54:11.840
when did this become i wish i was rich then what would be left for you

54:12.800 --> 54:15.760
nothing nice try ready

54:19.360 --> 54:23.600
god well lucy's such a skinny legend honestly found a switch

54:26.320 --> 54:29.840
oh no no don't do that that's the woody here we go

54:29.840 --> 54:37.520
oh something's open yeah my leg hey yo

54:40.560 --> 54:50.480
absolute brain so he shouldn't have said this line yet because oh i've never had that happen

54:50.480 --> 54:55.920
before i got pushed out of the way by the shadow oh my god i've never had that happen before the

54:55.920 --> 55:02.080
shadows are freaking i wonder if you can attack the shadow i've never been pushed out the way by

55:02.080 --> 55:07.920
the shadow before see this is the thing about playing the same game over and over something

55:07.920 --> 55:13.280
you'll happen every time and it's just fantastic anyway we're about to swim in medieval toxic waste

55:16.240 --> 55:18.000
the game's being coded as you play

55:18.160 --> 55:21.440
easy for you you aren't swimming in medieval toxic waste

55:22.800 --> 55:24.240
it was lucy's idea

55:28.800 --> 55:34.480
whoa whoa uh see when the camera angles start to shift it actually makes things like really hard

55:34.480 --> 55:43.040
to judge it's good for the skin remember that one post where that guy was like i'll for 500

55:43.120 --> 55:48.000
dollars let me go in your septic tank and he just hangs out in there and does the thing and it was

55:48.000 --> 55:52.800
like oh you're i mean yeah that was quite the pose

55:57.040 --> 56:02.400
you're going so fast the game can't keep up that was minging on his phone

56:02.400 --> 56:11.920
i have to get wet because you're here charming oh my god it's you know this man

56:11.920 --> 56:16.800
did you just ask a woman why she's not wet thanks that's sexual harassment honestly

56:16.800 --> 56:22.320
water check oh i just fell water oh well it's fine

56:23.920 --> 56:28.240
sorry it like cold water just went on my leg and i'm like ah you know what that's fine

56:28.240 --> 56:29.600
that's actually not that big a deal

56:32.720 --> 56:35.840
jesus it's you know that's brutal making someone fall to their death

56:38.080 --> 56:40.560
now i'm wet i'm a cut of fish i was wet from the start

56:45.280 --> 56:51.040
human resources why a septic tank it's just what the guy wanted it's like that japanese post

56:51.760 --> 56:58.400
oh this is another thing there is this is a true hashtag true story um

56:59.520 --> 57:08.800
so this wife went away on holiday for the weekend and her neighbor on friday went into her like

57:08.800 --> 57:15.040
toilet tank like japanese toilets are different from the way it's like done so he could look up

57:15.040 --> 57:22.400
and peep at her while she disintegrated basically um and because she went away on holiday uh that

57:22.400 --> 57:34.160
man perished uh via um freezing to death in kaka it was like bro don't get me wrong i'm no really

57:34.320 --> 57:41.280
any shame in anyone for what they like but to die to die i'll wait here

57:41.920 --> 57:48.000
it's a bit extreme it's a bit extreme like oh i did the last one oh jisun messed up on that one

57:48.000 --> 58:01.680
i'm not gonna lie oh jisun uh got it yeah thank you desmond did they scatter his ashes that's too

58:01.680 --> 58:11.200
funny that i can't even laugh at that that's awful that's awful oh my god that was so quick what is

58:14.880 --> 58:20.160
anyway the sequence is just teaching us the relationship that it's ill has with lucy

58:20.720 --> 58:26.160
a desmond has with lucy jesus i have the bleeding effect myself no no before you freaking take

58:26.240 --> 58:32.800
that out of context the bleeding effect is when desmond thingy's uh vtuber's stomach is so it must

58:32.800 --> 58:40.000
mean they're they're just a ketchup packet no stop it with the ketchup packet allegations okay

58:40.800 --> 58:49.040
vtubers can't beat them enough my goodness vtuber feels mildly ill oh she must be a ketchup packet

58:49.040 --> 59:04.640
you stop that right now naughty naughty stop it it's all right i'm a mustard pat it comes out

59:04.640 --> 59:09.200
yellow hello should i be worried do we need to get you a doctor

59:10.000 --> 59:20.240
when the past memories and new ones melt in yes desmond has a very hard time differentiating

59:20.240 --> 59:26.240
himself from xio because he spends so much time in the animus as xio i mean you'd do it too

59:27.360 --> 59:31.760
you'd do it too you'd do it too all right friendly over the section

59:32.320 --> 59:35.120
oh my god it's the back of the statue

59:37.200 --> 59:44.480
repeat after me stat u that's how you say statue in scott's stat u no t stat u

59:46.240 --> 59:47.680
oh i guess there is a t technically

59:48.080 --> 59:54.240
well i'm as if you die in the animus

59:55.680 --> 59:56.800
and you just perish

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.240
naughty i've finished

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.280
wow weapon ice gets free true

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.880

i'm not sure from uh portal 2 so we're now currently getting an energy supply to the animus

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:29.840
underneath the villa in order for upstair go the big baddies are called upstair go in this game

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:35.200
or templar so those are the big baddies um so basically you just need to go around the city

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:40.560
you can see that the patched everything up from the uh five centuries ago uh that the big old

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:49.840
fights were occurring i really like stacey milk i saw the reaction to fondle a bosom

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.080
admit that it was funny okay admit that it was funny or pick up 24 cards in uno right now

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:04.160
and anyone sitting with 24 cards in their hand are liars okay fondle a bosom was hilarious i don't

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:11.440
care i think someone was like it sounds like you're naming them from like that parody um uh that parody

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:18.560
movie uh austin powers and i'm like yeah you're supposed to have fun names who want serious names

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:26.320
that like no one can remember like cuttles cuttlefish okay strongy cuttles let's go uh a polar bear

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:32.080
okay i see i see snow paws yes she has paws and she's cold i see snow paws let's go like it's

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:37.200
really it's not that bad um so you're supposed to just look around with eagle vision to get a sense

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:44.160
of moving around um and all that jazz there's like one right next to me isn't there yet it's right

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:57.600
behind me uh box that was not a name carambi no carambi for like a cs go whichever perfect name

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:04.240
don't care carambi yes and caram sounds like ha ha ram so you can probably make a few puns

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:13.280
yes it's booted we're good to go yes it's booted name from money python's life of bright incontinent

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:19.280
above african saw you's all laughing at it and someone posted that incontinent to a screenshot

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.000
i was like oh no they've got me laughing that was like oh that was actually really funny

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.120
right we're going in the animus we're about to go back into the past to be it's your auditory

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.600
if we're still in the tutorial stage i will tell you when we get out of this tutorial stage

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:40.320
we've still probably got another hour in a bit sanctuary sanctuary as you may have noticed in

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:45.600
the van i've made some improvements to the animus and i've already seen a new vr training program

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.680
here you can show off all those flashy moves you picked up from your ancestors let me open one

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:59.360
in the mission ac show ac hall okay but it doesn't make sense maybe if we had like a fire and ace

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:05.120
like vtuber design ac no we can't like call ac we already have ac oh oh shit okay so this is

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:12.320
the virtual training i despise it i absolutely despise it i just cannot stand this section

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:18.400
it's for people who enjoy the combat or practice in it me i hate to despise it okay you see that

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:25.520
skinny guard he is a problem they can grab you yeah see the guards are trying to grab me and then

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:32.080
it breaks your streak if they grab you and it's so annoying i freaking hate the wee guards honestly

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:38.000
oh and i hate the lancers too i absolutely hate it i'm much better in combat yeah fuck you take it

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.320
take it the lancers have much bigger reach and are very hard to counter so when you're on a

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:49.280
killing streak it's much better to aim for those guys to defend your streak basically

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:57.840
skinny ball bad guards oh honestly lancers hate the skinny guards hate because they are agile

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:03.360
warriors and you have to freaking have a wee knife out in order to counter them properly

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:12.720
shrimp check yep posture still shrimp thank you oh we're in the tutorial for like another two hours

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:18.000
but the reason i'm going to praise the game is because it's hidden that you're in the tutorial

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.880
you progress through the story of the game via the tutorial like i know it sounds silly to praise

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:31.520
that because obviously all games work like that but i'll kind of point it out if you need to take

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:37.680
a break log out of the anime you can leave the machine whenever you like i'm all set to go don't

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:43.920
worry one last thing as you raise your synchronization by executing is that the way

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.520
press memories might even discover some repressed memories she be caught in bottom

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.600
ass and feet locked on that seat oh that's actually a really good like model

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.720
ready for like a eight hour stream ass and feet get on that suit

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:12.000
anyway i never expected you to see you play something i have terrible news but these

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.680
shippers normally play a video game with eye in the database now you won't find it

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.280
okay we're here present day

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.760
give me one second i'm gonna get a cola okay i'll leave that on so at least i'm not yapping

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.520
over the actual cutscenes for once in my freaking life

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.120
oh my god we're being touched by a whammy sorry i forget my hip i need to close my eyes if i walk

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:08.000
away so the sleep thing clicks on right but come on me come on me oh my god listen to the music

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.480
beautiful

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:28.480
oh gorgeous

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.680
i just got chills it's such an idiot i just love this game so much

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:53.760
it's just feel like so full of it like my heart feels so full i get to share this game and

01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:02.320
just appreciate it for what it is and this game come out in 2010 and it aged beautifully i will

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.760
not tell i will not take anyone telling me this game didn't age well so we're currently injured

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.760
and going to the doctor we're about to learn about health bar so we're still injured we're

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:21.440
still hurt in the top left corner we have five health squares and only one left that is how

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.000
we deal with health in the game do not take that horse i don't know why they put that horse there

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.760
unironically you don't go any faster on the horse to get to the healer

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.880
trying to tip you it says internal server it's okay you don't have to give me money just hanging

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:42.320
out it's fine i'm not sure what the problem is but hey but don't worry you don't have to give me

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.840
money thank you for being here for a man of your age tisk tisk

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.480
someone your age cannot recover from your wound like this with medicine here is something to

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:59.360
dull the pain it would heal over time four out of five doctors would suggest leeches

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:07.120
no leeches things however i can recommend several good colleagues around the sea do you

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:13.840
need anything else have fun at work don't worry guys if you ever have to leave stream i am an

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:20.000
endurance streamer i'm not very friendly because i'm a long time streamer um i do plan on streaming

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.240
for eight hours or finishing the story mode of this game um and tomorrow we will 100% it

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:35.360
because i've never 100% at the game before but with your encouragement i think it's possible

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:41.840
i think i could 100% this game when you collect all the board your tower like the flags um

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.120
all the hidden flags that are also in the halls of narrow which i will teach you all about very

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:54.800
shortly so this beautiful cutscene is how we unlock sections of the map on the HUD okay they're all

01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:01.120
hidden at the moment but we are going to be doing map update as you can see uh synchronized view

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:09.120
points beauty beauty beauty it jokes on you i'm listening at work oh my god those are the naughty

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:21.280
naughty stinky borja we don't like borja we don't take kindly to your kind around these parts borja

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:31.680
100% in this game in two days possible yes sir with autism anything is possible i'm so sorry

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:40.560
i'm so sorry i apologize um i am very passionate about what i'm passionate about and if i am like

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:46.400
unable to do so so ie i can just straight up like play this game the way i wanted then yes

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:53.760
we're also like 100% in skyrim next week achievement one i'm so sorry it must be like really weird

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.360
just randomly coming out with it i'll uh we'll refer to the strontism how about that so we're

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.960
currently tailing do you see the yellow hit marker or hit box above these this is tailing it means

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:10.640
do not be discovered by them they can be pushed by npcs so they can turn around and look at you

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:18.000
it's not um it's not the best but um it certainly works perfectly well um

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:25.200
it's absolutely beautiful game so we're just entailing these guards don't look backwards

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:31.040
unless an npc kindly bumps into them so we can get as close as we want we can like creep on the

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.840
walls cc he just turned around there if i wasn't creeping on the wall even the game's like uh you

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.760
should maintain your distance you're a bit too close but we can like creep creeping

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.880
okay and you can also blend in but i am not controlling the movement of this crowd the

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:06.560
crowd will go on a certain path so you can part ways but you cannot be discovered while concealed

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:12.640
in a crowd like this guards can walk by me i can have high notoriety and guards will ignore me as

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:19.840
long as i am coming 100% in the achievements in skyrim sorry i don't mean 100% in skyrim because

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:25.680
that is impossible as you said because of the repeating quest factors the achievements i have

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:31.600
100% in skyrim achievements multiple times and i would absolutely love to share the experience

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:40.480
with you and tell you about all the secret uh little bits i know um and yeah okay i'm also

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.520
going to mention the multiplayer in brotherhood i believe the servers are down okay oh whoa that

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:51.280
just came out nowhere hold on hold on we weren't even at the we were not even at the section okay we

01:14:51.280 --> 01:15:00.720
didn't even go we were nco didn't kill civilians did that kill a human like a non-guard what is

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:07.280
going on oh my god sorry the sequence was not supposed to start on that staircase it's supposed

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.200
to start by this freaking did that kill him if i'm a citizen

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:24.160
what just happened i think i was too distracted i apologize but don't worry we can always replay

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:30.400
and come back for 100 percent i can't believe i just killed a citizen i never make that mistake

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.520
in this game sorry

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.520
i too have lost family to the rope

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:53.200
i understand how can you my libya was innocent i have lost family to the rope treachery

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.440
you called you cuddled off that's so hangy if i cut her rope

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:09.520
what the fuck down sorry you guys didn't see that all these options just popped up on my screen

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:17.440
i was like these are too many things going on right now okay so this quest do you see how

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.640
we are assigned someone with a name that is because you're actually killing multiplayer

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:29.280
characters that are in multiplayer i know it sounds silly and i know it sounds bizarre but

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:36.080
when you could play uh assassin's group brotherhood multiplayer um you got to pick between the skins

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.680
and we're literally about to kill someone who is a skin in the multiplayer mode uh 100 for this

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:47.280
one is just air assassination super simple and easy uh the guards do attack you but some turn

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:53.200
into cowards once you kill multiple guards which is a lovely paypal support doesn't open for several

01:16:53.200 --> 01:17:03.200
hours did i break paypal are you guys trying to support me too much that we broke paypal

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:10.960
wait can none of the girls get donations right now uh so you can't be grabbed but as i said

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.920
the more guards you kill some of the weaker ones like the ones with just a hat will turn into

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:22.720
cowards which is an absolutely lovely human detail yeah see the ones with uh those like

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:31.760
beret type hats they turn into cowards beautiful beautiful detail i think that is gorgeous to show

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:38.480
human nature instead of the ai just being like constantly attack attack attack die die die

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:48.480
because you will i just think these are and this is 2010 development was 20 2008 2008 maybe even

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:56.240
as far back as 2007 um so you're not allowed to scale the rooftops because guards find you extremely

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:02.640
sussy but guards on the floor don'ts like this guy does not care about me right now um but like

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:09.360
for development that far back to like capture to even think outside the box to capture human nature

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:16.560
like that definitely hats off to the development team um i know it is by ubisoft and there are some

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:24.320
very there's a very unique ending to this tale and assassins crude brotherhood and i couldn't for

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:31.040
the life of me uh there's a feather up on here by the way uh you can grab sightings if you cite

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.000
something but can't grab it you can go into ego mode and then it'll automatically stick to your map

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.760
which is fantastic so if you see something but you can't grab it in the moment um but yeah

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:53.440
this game has also been rated in the top 100 games of all time i believe it placed around 60th

01:18:53.440 --> 01:19:00.640
on recent 100 uh game ranking tech things but sas crude brotherhood always makes it and i 100

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:07.120
agree for me it is first place but i'm biased but absolutely deserved it so we have met marquia

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:13.680
veli this is marquia veli he was the guy um that was in the villa and that was disappointed in us

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:21.360
not killing the spaniard uh and he is gonna tell us what's going on in roma because we don't know

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:26.240
what's going on in roma we know the borja is everywhere as we can see them literally in front

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:31.920
of us right now so we are going to get the dirty details on what's going on in roma you would be

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:40.080
wise to purchase missing equipment you will not live long in roma without supplies i have my blade

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:48.000
and the guards have their guns good to see of the borja fortunately i can help

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.760
borja hate we hate the borja perhaps you will listen to reason i'm gonna burp is that okay

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:04.160
i will let you know that was me popping my lips that was the actual burp sorry sorry to mislead

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:10.240
you like that so you need to wait for a little second because if you go too quickly into the

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:17.040
blacksmith the items won't actually be available to purchase which is your literal quest so you're

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:22.800
buying an armor and a small weapon this small weapon is what you use against the skinny guards

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:29.680
because it is amazing for taming on defending yourself now you can survive that's right that's

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.880
right i debated you didn't know yeah you thought that pop was my burp

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.080
and

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.320
so for some reason even though you're right next to him

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.520
he gets really quiet in certain voicelines

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.920
i'm literally hugging him to get him to talk

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.520
money

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.520
jar of leeches

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:37.520
so again eagle vision to lock in that flag because we can't grab it right now but that's okay

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:38.720
so

01:21:52.640 --> 01:22:00.560
okay so we're starting to learn that the borja has overtaken roma and is completely messing up for

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:08.080
the people and mark you avail is obviously not very happy but we have to do what the current

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:18.880
laid-out rules are and the yummy jar of leeches the cuttlefish eat leeches i feel like they probably

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.200
do

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.160
i'll talk after this but

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:35.120
water check should we not travel by horse roma is quite large as chaserates conquest in romania

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:41.280
continue to succeed the borja growing power they have taken desirable areas of the city for

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:48.400
themselves we cannot use the stables here oh they will have the borja is low now what are

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:54.480
you implying it's you do not play dumb with me matthew early do you have some kind of plan

01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:01.840
i am improvising okay now to very quickly bring you up to speed the borja are forbidding us in

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:08.880
this section to use the stables and other areas of development also this is the most

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:15.600
fucking annoying thing to get a hundred percent on hold on oh get off the horse i hate when they

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:23.120
go on the horse oh no i've made it so much worse okay so this captain you have to grab him and put

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:30.160
him in that um uh oh my god that freaking citizen was in the way i didn't want to strike in case

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:37.520
i can't see because of the camera angle by the way this game aged really well it aged really well

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:48.000
i promise it aged well no right i am going to no he's on it no this couldn't have gone any worse

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:55.360
please i've never had this issue in this game before right just grab him grab him and push him

01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:01.440
fuck him you can kill no right no right we're not a hundred percent in this right now i'm literally

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:08.400
bright red an embarrassment of this gameplay where fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:18.160
please get off the horses i hate when they're on the horses all right maybe i can do it hold on

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:24.080
oh my god i can still 100 percent it okay you need to basically drag this guy to the scaffolding

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:34.720
and push him in it yes whenever you kill a captain of a district always loot his body he has insane

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:41.280
amounts of money on his person that was terrible but we resurrected it the reason and you have to kill

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:46.960
the other guards first is so you are free to push that guy into the scaffolding to achieve 100 on this

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:54.480
borgia tower my god i have never attracted those other four guards before i've never had them jump

01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:05.760
on freaking horses before that was terrible but we did it we got a hundred percent oh my god

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:12.560
i'm my face is bright red i'm like oh my god oh i forgot to burn the tower oh for goodness sake

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:20.000
we're okay we need to call it not the tower oh my god i'm getting so flustered oh right so we've

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.360
just reclaimed this district so you need to burn the tower to in order to symbolize to the borgia

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.320
they're no longer welcome in this area and their rules no longer apply to this current district of

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:41.680
roma okay wait i'm an idiot markia valley hasn't told me to burn the tower yet please pardon me

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:49.360
for jumping that i'm skipping ahead of the game right out my way out my way out my way out my way

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.520
the guards make peep you here but they don't actually get you okay we are now giving instructions

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:03.280
you are right we need to send they see oh i might need to take my hoodie off i'm sweating and embarrassed

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.840
man i was like oh my god you guys are gonna think i've never played this game before i'm like no

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.160
it's my favorite game of all time the guards outside there will peep you but they'll never

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:18.240
follow you inside as long as you keep moving yeah the guards will never go for you um literally

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:24.400
xio is exhausted he's climbed this tower three times now he's like jesus women give me a break

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:29.840
okay you can ignite to the borgia tower like so

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:51.520
oh because they all get killed okay now this is another interesting part of the

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:56.080
game which you can renovate districts to have an income

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:07.680
the controller vibration on the literally uh is crazy okay we have just renovated the

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:16.160
stables we now have access to horsey warseys yeah no so we will jump on a horse thank you

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:26.480
horse vtuber we love you he does he's supposed to talk to you through this but it bugs out so

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:33.200
he's not talking to us right now but basically he's like uh you can't just do what you want xio

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:39.120
it's dangerous roma have been here the borgia have like settled their ways the people are scared

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:44.480
basically too long didn't read thank you marquia valley for your input it always bugs out he should

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:56.720
be talking to us like right now you always use the white and gray horse here i'm gonna say something

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:04.480
oh here we go but can you also close them i intend to heal the sickness or treat it simple

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.440
stop sparring with me fine let us talk openly there

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:18.000
oh he mad at us i am inclined to disagree look at this is the center of borgia

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.240
killing one man and not change this you need to take away the source about

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.240
are you suggesting we are beating to the death yes brotherhood of the people yes yes yes yes

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.840
oh shit sorry sorry also you should always go behind the npc because that'll happen

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.280
the audio is bugging out

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.880

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:08.320
yeah this isn't gonna do anything okay okay we're closing the game closing the game

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.960

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:51.120
my heart feels full of relief it is so bootyful um obviously because of it's an older game you

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:58.320
can see the distance rendering not loud just the scream was ear piercing oh okay do apologize for

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:04.480
that sometimes i get a little bit excited but i'm sure you like it when a girl screams in your ear

not now shon not now shon go away get back here give me my money back

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:16.960
okay there we go we made it

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:21.760
did you liberate your money from our friend

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:28.400
and be a small victory they are up and time with work we'll have a few dozen more

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.400
depends on the the the subject six you mentioned we'll be broken we'll do that at the end i don't

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.120
want to do subject 16 right now where is my contact Vinicius he should have already intercepted the

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:46.320
letter okay follow me okay we are now raiding our horses through roma uh mark your valley is

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:51.760
just kind of spanked us for being like you believe in the people and esio goes yeah i believe in the

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.000
people and then the people just stole a lot of money from us but we got it back that's fine that's

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:03.200
the main thing but esio is starting the concept of the brotherhood of assassins where you take an

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:10.880
ordinary citizen who is fed up with life who is being treated badly who has just had an absolutely

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:18.240
awful time and you've gone hey do you want to get back at your oppressors and then they go uh cc

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:23.680
because obviously they're italian they wouldn't say yes they'd say see you and then the good part of

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:29.040
the the best part i would argue about this game starts up from there

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.360
okay so we're just following horsey horsey around

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.000
i love you excelene because i'm low IQ don't worry i'm low IQ in general but these are just

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:47.520
one of the games that i'm like uh i love everything about see the means of the projection

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:57.840
astronomy can relate to being a precious gosh steady on thankfully i was born in a good time

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:04.320
line but uh if you didn't know the english tried to eradicate uh scottish people many a time uh

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:13.200
however uh the romans built a wall called hadrian's wall because they weren't interested in going

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:20.000
any further into scotland they said now you guys can keep it we're not interested in invading us

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.960
that's true that's actually science

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:33.120
leave my thieves alone you foul beast oh that was a bit steady on it esio what was that so you're

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:39.280
supposed to like jump on them okay well we got countered so i'll just be up this i just kicked

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:47.920
i've never had these issues oh my god performance i can't get up one in three men

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.400
time me at the term the bass okay we'll find you at the bass okay we're about to do a major

01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:03.680
tutorial part coming up but don't worry it's like a good part um so we're just gonna skedaddle halfway

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:09.840
through this we're currently in the coliseum uh coliseum has been wrecked for many a century now

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:17.360
this is very accurate to probably what it looks like i'm going one one one one in three men but

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:30.800
one in one coliseum how dare you i assure you my bony bony can my my pecker um it's so easy to get

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:40.240
to get engorged oh my god i want to be an announcer any engorgers anyone getting

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:49.280
engorged right now yeah yeah i bet you are okay this part if we can do it flawlessly first time

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:56.080
so i don't need to be embarrassed however the game crashes at this part multiple times for me so

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.120
first things first take out your wee knife know the big knife take out your wee knife okay

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.040
for this part that comes up because you're supposed to not get hit god damn you can see me

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:18.960
river and moon walked into that sequence there we are about to encounter a second enemy not

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:32.560
the border romuli let's see if i can do this without messing up okay pause you have to reselect

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:39.600
your small knife because the game always right if i don't get hit i am blessed by the gods because

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:49.760
you're supposed to do the sequence without getting hit i hate when they attack that blinking means

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.320
they're attacking and you can't if they have the red hit marker above their head you can't

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:59.120
tell if they're about to okay we got we got the ten in a row serial killer achievement

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:06.240
oh we did it hundred percent of that oh that bit always stresses me at my heart rate

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:15.040
okay this is a tutorial sequence this is called the layers of romulus

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.520
goya or romuli if you you want to get take his baking but romulus

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:29.600
wow i swear she killed them all with one knife so this is timed okay we're on a timer

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:38.320
and you will watch me pass up flags and as well as pass up treasure boxes because we will have to

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:42.800
come back in a hundred percent this section because in order to get the hundred percent

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:50.880
and time love is what this one is so we're just gonna speed on by we're gonna do a little speed

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:56.320
gonzalez i am not going to read chat for eight minutes it takes me about seven minutes to do

01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:02.080
the sequence the timer is eight minutes i apologize chat i can see you rating my burp in the corner

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:08.240
of my eye you must always do the levers in this order in order to maximize your time

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:16.640
um it is possible that you fall in a sequence and you'll lose time um but normally i finish

01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:25.040
roughly 40 seconds to one minute early um unfortunately this game's a bit funnery i've

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:30.160
just wasted a bit of time doing that which is a shame but hey ho it's what happens

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:37.680
uh but yes obviously you can tell the music's a bit different the i don't know how compose the music

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:45.200
or who is commissioned to compose the music very very good okay i can read you for like one second

01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:52.720
she hates us no i'm done i need to do the time sequence i finish early oh i finish early all

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:59.840
right you want to tell me you can tell you how early i finish i think i've said this before but um

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:09.840
my record is like one minute and like 54 seconds roughly and the only reason i know why is because

01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:17.040
that's how long the preview was for the video it was a free preview i'm just gonna admit it sorry but

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:24.640
if you guys are like i'm so nervous to talk to her in chat i am absolutely not destined

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:35.440
uh to be professional or whatever but yeah that's actually true story i could probably find the

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:46.240
video and share it um if you really wanted to see how good that preview was um we're under a timer so

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:57.040
we are just gonna kind of right okay you need to look for the open gate and i get it wrong all

01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:02.000
the time but open gate and then take a no oh my god i get it wrong all the time do you know how

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.960
many times i've freaking played this game and i do that every single time you'd think i'd learn

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:18.880
honestly uh one day i'll learn but i have a fun factoid that i will tell you later once we get

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.800
to that part of the thingy but uh this will not be the only time we are playing Assassin's Creed

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:35.120
on this channel a Assassin's Creed brotherhood on this channel in particular um because i um have

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:43.360
very much tism this game into submission and i don't know should i just ruin it you know what if

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:50.720
you're here right now i think i'm allowed to ruin it so my birthday is the 10th of october

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:58.240
um oh you must always grab this light the game will pretend like you can do it so october 10th is

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:05.360
my donathan and you'll never guess what date uh gets mentioned in this video game october 10th

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:13.200
so we're playing it on my donathan um and i get to nerd about the game all over again and i'm already

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:20.320
beaming with happiness just thinking about it i was like oh no no no no i'm going to subject you

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:26.560
this twice you will you will watch me play this game twice and be so happy about it

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:34.800
um we're getting close to the main hall the main hall is where the last major part of the

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.480
sequence comes in i'm glad the game didn't crash actually earlier because i've not really had i

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:45.680
don't really experience any crashing after the wolf section once you've killed all the romuli guys

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:52.400
then uh not once have i had the game crash on multiple playthroughs um this game was literally

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.600
made for me for real for real like actually though like i mean how did they know like oh my god this

01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:06.800
is work um for safety i just follow this i think you maybe can jump off as a fire but uh i'm not

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:15.920
risking the run i do not want to play this like section again it's not boring but hmm

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.760
i'm trying to choose my words carefully as if the dev team are sitting here watching they're not

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:28.640
um obviously every game section you have a preference for me being tamed to claim about

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:33.520
isn't but i understand that they do have to introduce some sort of element like

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:41.360
not to panic the player but if you were just to willfully glide through these areas then it might

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:49.840
be quite boresome any boresoms there's a flag to the left we will not be collecting it there's

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.320
also a treasure box up ahead again we're not going to be collecting it we are trying to get

01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:00.000
our eight-minute timer we have entered a cutscene and we will also have a foot set there this is

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.760
the grand hall this is the last section and it's a nightmare if you mess up on it but uh i've done

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:15.200
it quite a lot so the CEO of Ubisoft sitting in here like you're doing what to my game um

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:23.360
um i always mess this bit up as well you need to look for this one in order to get inside

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:36.160
this section um now Assassin's Creed was made long before the yellow paint so they use candle

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:41.600
light and fixtures i'll show you one section that really highlights the old candle fixtures

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:48.080
and we're about to break this so don't be shocked it's quite loud at the breaking

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:55.040
yeah so the game will help you in case you mess up because they have been

01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.800
they know they've made it awkward so you saw that those treasure boxes you see that flag there

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:05.120
again we're just gonna ignore it we're here for the speed run and we're not i actually don't know

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.920
what the speed run of this game would be i assume it's probably like under three hours the first

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.240
time i played this it took me so long to figure out where i had to go you have to go on the chair

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:19.440
literally the chair and then this little pathetic beam do you know how long it took me to find this

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:25.760
beam as a child like i started asking my mum for help because my mum plays Tomb Raider and she was

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:31.760
like then you look at me straw day and i'm like mum you're smiling like i'm a child you can you

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:39.920
must be able to see uh you must also grab a lot um to to like save yourself see this doesn't look

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:46.400
like you should be able to grab it but if you hold b you can get it sorry i play xbox controller uh

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:55.120
i don't know what it is for like ps uh four is it triangle no triangles why um

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.040
but yeah

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:03.760
we're almost there we're doing good for time we've not actually made any mistakes yet like

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.880
such as falling off falling off is the oh man is she fell off okay okay dude you're done

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:15.920
um it's the biggest mistake you can make in these time sequences uh but don't worry the game does

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:22.800
try to resurrect you so this is the freaking jump that i've it's freaking humongous and it's you

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:31.040
know you cannot make that in real life but we are perfect for times um and when you pick up

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:37.280
the objective the timer stops so you could in theory go back and get all the stuff you missed

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:44.880
however i am much more happier to continue on with the campaign but this is a tutorial section

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:52.960
that's part of the main quest line um for the layer of Romulus which there are six total

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.320
and it unlocks you special armor uh i personally don't actually go right we're gonna pick it up

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:05.920
we're gonna pick it up so we're picking it up now so the timer has now officially stopped we are no

01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:12.800
longer under the eight minute timer so i leave my family's armor in here one of the finest sets

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:20.080
ever made may you who finds it receive strength and battle change of handwriting we have taken it

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:26.720
and set it back behind the iron door six keys unlock it spread amongst our brothers it shall

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:33.840
be said to come from your Romulus and they will worship it and we have a picture of the armor

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:39.920
that we may unlock at a later time again i don't normally unlock it through my like first playthrough

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.320
it's not necessary it's a bit time consuming as well it's probably like an extra hour so the

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:50.960
timer is paused if i pause the game time remaining 133 so yeah we can pick up all these treasure

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:58.080
boxes because we're gonna need it you get florins in this game and the campaign actually requires

01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:05.120
you to have 3,500 florins at one section um and we just want to make sure we go above and beyond

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:12.560
because we cannot invest in like properties for example that part comes very soon um

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:20.800
how kind of them to write in clear uh yeah detail for us to read their uh evil plans basically

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:28.640
but there we go ancient roman tomowers would you like to taste my ancient roman tomato

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:36.880
that tomato at golden boy achievement unlock so we've done one that's one layer of Romulus

01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:45.440
i'm gonna head off thank you for hanging please don't worry i believe shibi is coming up in an hour

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:49.360
no in 10 minutes who's coming up next

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:57.680
i'm going to take a drink i believe the gorgeous are supporting them is that where the ketchup

01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:03.920
no you're done you're done bam you're not bad and nine minutes yes okay when shibi goes live

01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:10.160
please do tell me i will always recommend you guys go watch my gen mates another encryption this one

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:14.800
was supposed to be ledger because they are transmitting them because i'm an endurance streamer i'd

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:20.880
rather you support them we have nothing sometimes logic is not the only way to are you also an older

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:28.560
yes you said we had allies in the city bring me to them okay this is a beautiful quest

01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.320
it's a beautiful quest and it has include revelation yes you play a much older etio i

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:38.000
think you're like 70 years old technically and you're like jumping about paragliding and stuff and

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.080
it's like really um they really stretch the old dates to make sure they could get them in this

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:53.680
um see you tonight when mercy rates into you honestly though gilf etio

01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:02.800
brotherhood is etio and his prime for you for it he's like 42 or 41 i believe in this game

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:05.280
bit of an old man but hey

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:15.840
okay we're about to unlock the next sequence it's so good

01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:23.440
so the map of roma is massive but there's guards everywhere so he's telling us if you use the

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:28.800
aqueducts you can move about real quick so we are going to use the aqueduct right now to get to

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:35.360
island tebarina and this is where the sassans are based on on the map in roma

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:42.960
when mercs aired in stream stroneys just finished the intro yapping of the story

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:51.600
honestly oh my god azerid it's so well on her 2.0 she's fantastic with all her yapping

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:55.840
i think someone said yep for corn and i was like well that's pretty smart i like that

01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:02.080
i've heard a great deal about him from my cousin so he's not really in this at all

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:08.800
fabio i feel like he might have been dlc content or something he has two seats in this game

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:20.240
and yeah i don't know what i'd rather confuse i hope we will be free

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:27.920
she will occurs i wonder why i picked a zura

01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:40.160
what are you also unaware that the borja have captured the apple have eaten

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:42.640
oh i do have lost the apple

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:48.160
so you do not know what goes on with our enemies do we at least have an underground here to work

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:54.400
with no underground network found our mercenaries are ensnared in elusiva la volpe doesn't even talk

01:52:54.400 --> 01:53:00.320
to me we have girls working for us in a brothel frequented by cardinals oh my god is she be you're

01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:05.840
in my game but the madame there is okay no not that rather attend parties than further of course

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:13.520
what about the city's thieves do they have a deal see but they refuse to talk to us i do not know why

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:20.400
what are you going to do to make some friends make some friends ah such a good line

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:24.880
because we're about to make three different allies of different districts we're about to

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:28.400
make friends with the thieves we're about to make friends with the holes we're about to make friends

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:37.040
with the mercenaries let's go it's a very good very good we also unlock notoriety in this as well

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:45.200
um and we also unlock having little uh the achievement unlocked from in ruins

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:54.640
make friends with the holes to the window the fighter the lover and the thief to the sweat

01:53:54.960 --> 01:54:02.400
drop off my boss oh ski ski mother you want a scottish cover of that song

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:10.000
right we are going to do the eagle point right now just so we can kind of see what's going on around

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:23.520
island tibirina please do right so we are going to purposely do the thieves last the reason for

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:29.680
the thieves last is because it introduces notoriety so guards are going to start harassing us a bit

01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:37.680
more um heralds are going to start talking about the devious acts that xio has committed and we're

01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:45.760
also going to have witnesses that have falsified their testimonies you didn't falsify your testimony

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:58.320
to me we've also been introduced to the bank um where we can get money for investing in the city

01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:06.000
every 20 minutes we will get our little 20 or cut from investing in these places um

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:14.400
and we have withdrawn four to eight florins we are rich we're rich we're rich any you played that game

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.560
have you heard about that game that that one game about the the guys that dig in the mines

01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:24.240

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:30.560
not interested we're going to go to the holes first because there's holes in the lion

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:38.720
um and do this quest line this is the campaign quest that requires florins in order to progress

01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:44.880
however you can get a very i think you get roughly 2000 florins for doing this quest

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:53.840

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.680
weapon drapes swords as well work but um yes you had so you have to wait until they attack you

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:41.680
basically because they're so agile it's such a and then you can do that but

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.080
oh my god oh i don't want the guards to see me with this body we're just gonna go straight into

02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:58.480
the memory to win the guards to make the bodies on me it was fun hanging yes have fun with sheepsters

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.640
bye bye thanks for hanging do you know where she is

02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:17.600
multi-stream drift that means help in attack oh my god she got her look at her nose she got

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:23.680
a nose job look at that peak on that nose that's beautiful i will get her back

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:32.320
beautiful beautiful oh i really need to pee not gonna lie can i need to pee um maybe after

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:38.960
i finish this act we can go pee if you see top left it says like i've got 5 000 florans but i

02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:46.080
need 2.5 it must be 3k for the banker uh sequence but that's not yet the banker comes later um

02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:51.840
banker is a later act we are currently doing the lover the thief and the fighter

02:01:54.240 --> 02:02:01.520
okay now that i've noticed i need to pee i really need to pee um uh brain psychology have you heard

02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:06.880
of this uh do you want to maybe not i'm a bit rude we are just gonna run normally you can just

02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:14.880
take a horse over this section but i find they've spawned a wee bit too much people to like walk

02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:19.360
around and the horse really struggles to go in between like the streets especially if there's

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:25.120
narrow sections whereas etio can just straight up jump over uh so we will be just doing that

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:35.920
self-fulfilling prophecy i need to pee oh my god weapons if we all pee together at the same time

02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:41.360
will we like affect the water like flush system why did you take out the sword etio i

02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:46.720
he just poked him in that eye etio that was that was a lot oh

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:52.720
whoopsies i actually didn't mean to do that i literally just smacked my mouth i didn't mean

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:58.000
to kill him i'm sorry you're just trying to get your paycheck for your wife and kids and i've just

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:06.400
like literally made made her a widow oh don't really feel good about that one so this is a

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:16.240
borger zone it's actually really annoying do we do the borger zone before we do this

02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:22.160
no we won't i can't be arsed we'll come back to this zone it's a lot easier when you have recruits

02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:28.320
have you come for the whore are you here for the whore close enough are you dancing to me

02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:38.400
it's what happens at football halftime oh i heard that hey let oh my god i don't remember this part

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:43.600
right again no way did you see the four things behind me soldiers are about to board this boat as

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:52.400
well okay you must loot the bodies oh i forgot to loot the body oh that's nice oh why are the freaking

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:54.000
now

02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:03.280
energy pro okay so we're gonna look the bodies of the thieves because they normally have unique

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:10.000
items like elf and ivory 200 coins i thought it was a bit more than that uh yeah vlad then

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:17.360
paler coins um these items can be traded at shops for special items who goes there identify yourself

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:28.400
um and after completing this quest we unlock courtesans which can distract guards um they are

02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:36.960
very vital to a later campy a later sequence uh actually the banker sequence which i previously

02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:43.120
mentioned is when they are vital and a part of the gameplay you can also get favors done by them i

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:50.560
don't mean like that because they're courtesans i mean like so the base price to hire a group is 150

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:58.320
florans but if you wow them uh you can get a discount rate of 75 florans i've made that sound so

02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:05.280
weird i know but it's the gameplay um the thieves if you upgrade them and impress them the thieves

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:12.640
will pick pocket naturally as you walk through clouds but it's a little bit more it's not awkward

02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:20.880
to get the thieves favor they just have a few more unique um a few more unique things you have to do

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:25.200
i will explain it when we once we unlock it we're about to unlock it right now and it'll make more

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:33.280
sense um but we're basically making generic allies and soon we will make brotherhood allies which are

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:39.200
assassin allies and they will help your gameplay if you feel like you are a weak gamer or you're just

02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:45.680
not there with it with timing and like things if the games are going too fast you're i can't keep up

02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:51.040
this is the kind of game for you once you know what you're doing and get used to the controls

02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:58.560
because once you unlock assassin recruits your life is so much easier from there it's it's bliss

02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:04.320
it's a dream it's one of those games where not everything has to be on you in order to progress

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:09.680
and that these are my kind of games okay i don't want to feel stressed out uh if i don't hit that

02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:16.960
you can quickly loot this little box that's on the balcony here uh 75 for a whole group of them

02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:22.320
damn no wonder strongy only was 100 for the ace of wire but could you imagine if a con would let us

02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:31.760
do that though i think we'd get kicked out i'm not gonna lie not that i'm insinuating anything

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:43.040
would occur in the booth but i feel like i do not know things may go hand quickly uh

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:48.560
oh is there sister and her mom they're in roma now

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:54.560
you cannot close i need your help

02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:00.720
he he good morning good good morning good afternoon and good evening oh yes good morning

02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:03.760
good afternoon no good morning good evening good afternoon there we go that's

02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:15.280
so claudia is currently she be gone bum because she's about to run a grotella the blooming rose

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:23.120
why do these ladies have horns that was the style back and then they did their research these are

02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:28.720
the hairstyles uh at the time good morning good evening and good night did i say the wrong way

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:38.320
sorry i'm a wee bit slow so we are now about to renovate this lovely location

02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:44.880
and our sister claudia is going to run it and we now have favor with the courtesans

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:52.560
uh the rose that infuriate the blooming rose or something like that um there's a flag at the

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:58.800
top you can actually see it shimmering right now very slightly um but we're about to go insane

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:08.560
gentle called the blooming rose honestly though there are cons in Glasgow that would let you do xd

02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:13.920
we were talking about like actually coming to physical cons

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:20.640
the most popular brothel in roma rose in fjord well invested here i keep a list of the skills

02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:26.160
taught to my girls you're not gonna need them much think you could do better

02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:33.120
no problem that's you the board job make it difficult for claudia's girls there are several

02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:40.400
things you could do that would aid them i will keep that you can do side quest for the brotella

02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:49.520
with your mum or whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa no no she assigns you quest

02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:56.480
you do not do a quest with your mum in the game okay

02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:06.080
apologies right okay so as i was talking about you can kind of level them up you can be given

02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:11.440
assignments so right now it costs 150 florins to highlight uh to hire a group of girls um

02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:20.080
send 10 guards distracted hide bodies um poison uh assassinate from blind spots

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:24.240
assassinate from behind smoke bomb we've not unlocked smoke bomb yet that comes later

02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:30.320
but you can do these and gain favour with the factions and it makes your gameplay a lot easier

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:40.800
um right next we are going to actually factually do the mercenaries which is this one i'm just

02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:47.920
highlighting it on the map so i don't get confused yes it is very far away um however

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:56.320
well we can just run there i think i can't take a horse and i cannot take the aqueduct because

02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:01.920
as soon as you summon the horse you basically get walled off by the layout of the map which is fine

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:07.120
because we're literally in an area where people are supposed to be living and thriving and doing

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:12.400
things so yeah horses aren't really supposed to just roll all the way through though this is a lost

02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:16.640
memory of uh the girl that got away but we're not gonna do it right now we're gonna do it at the

02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:23.760
end i do apologize if you're really interested in the story uh what's her name chris christina

02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:32.640
is her name um but that sad part comes in later uh it is a very unfavourable and sad memory so i

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:39.360
like leaving it to the end i'd rather just focus on the happy times only 500 more meters to go

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:48.480
christina i knew it was christina yeah this game as much as i'll meme about the render distance

02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:53.920
like as soon as you get closer to someone i've just added so much time going this way whatever um

02:10:55.440 --> 02:11:00.400
i'm like i'm trying to find the main freaking road but i can't find it it's really annoying

02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:04.560
okay i found the main road and i'm about to go off it yippee oh i didn't mean to do that

02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:10.960
swap to my sword oh this entire zone's red and i'm not strong enough to kill him we are

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:17.280
did we just run through the area to save us time to be honest

02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:25.360
no no i'm not stopping you can't make me go away you stink stinky stinky guard

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:31.200
we'll come back once we unlock recruits um i can't get over your accent thanks respond in with it uh

02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:36.880
if you'd like to visit Glasgow please do please support our economy because it's in absolute shambles

02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:44.320
in the UK um maybe i should do that maybe i should like plan a trip if you ever came to

02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:47.520
scotland and i'll be like you should go here and you should go here because i've been here and i've

02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:59.760
been there um that'd be cute um the order is an acquired taste oh yeah stinky uh oh stinky

02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:06.080
okay these are the french what do we think of the french what do we think of the french

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:10.880
we think they're fish they smell sorry there's like a football chant that's like what do we

02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:16.160
think of the french i can't remember it but it's like what do we think of the french what do we

02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:24.000
think of the french uh Glasgow's nice while you visited glad you didn't get stabbed the one of

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:30.080
the highest rate places to get stabbed however rate is one of the friendliest as well in europe

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:36.480
all of europe i don't know i don't know what it is what it is okay we made it we made it

02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:44.240
we are about to meet Bartolomeo the owner i guess of the mercenary guild

02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:51.920
come in come in i'll kill you if you don't

02:12:52.880 --> 02:13:00.560
water check Bartolomeo you have to meet my wife Bianca oh no fantasy yeah Bianca's

02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:07.040
his sword sorry his sword of his name is Bianca did you check behind the table okay that's a

02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:09.440
reference to assassin's creed one just so you know

02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:19.120
fantasy day ah don't mind if i do on chante

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.400
i still haven't harassed emi with my french uh scottish french accent

02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:32.320
i should force her to make an ASMR french collab with me but i like purposely put my accent on

02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:41.440
and she's just cringing in the corner don't forget to stretch yes uh i will need to educate you guys

02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.880
on why we need to stretch our legs to make sure we don't have a bit of veins

02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:51.120
our position is weak

02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:54.960
if you can defeat them we can concentrate our forces on the french round

02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:07.200
so i will educate you right now my lovely jubblies

02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:15.680
did you know overwhelmingly the people that suffer from hemorrhoids which is a failure of a vein

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:21.360
in your booty hole is office workers because they sit down for long periods of time so i always

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:27.680
recommend stretching often or standing up we are all about to go for a pee break and i recommend

02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:33.280
you all get up with me um sorry that i never explained that mission there if you kill only

02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:37.920
the captain you get a hundred percent super simple easy and you can also pick up a flag on the way

02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:45.920
uh so yes uh we desire to not have any issues with our booty holes so i will recommend we stretch

02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:51.040
roughly every two hours um i've no idea how long i've been streaming for but we should probably

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:56.320
dozen um the guards will not harass you at this area it's super easy and you can pick up this

02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:06.080
uh little treasure box it's phil yes um uh it's quite interesting like the knee uh this sounds

02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:12.640
absolutely bizarre but the nature of hemorrhoids is quite interesting because it's literally just

02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:17.440
what side am i supposed to climb up i can't get up there um it's literally just a vein in your

02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.160
booty hole that's you know failed and there's nothing really more to it it's just like adios

02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:28.240
i'm out and then that's what hemorrhoid is and you just get a cream and you know put it on your

02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:32.400
butt and then it goes away it's really bizarre or if you're someone like it's a really a shame

02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:37.440
i've like heard stories like people who suffer uh you need to like get on operation on your butt

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:46.880
but um yeah i don't know i just sorry i'm just vomiting about like biology and diagnosis and

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:57.280
stuff so yeah i am not expecting these topics a conversation and so i do apologize do we go left

02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:01.120
or right here i actually i think yeah we were supposed to go left okay

02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:09.840
the butthole though yes you you will have the healthiest booty hole uh enjoying my streams

02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:18.240
because we will have healthy butts together uh okay first synchronize the viewpoint and then

02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:23.360
ignite the board your tower do not ignite the board your tower first because the viewpoint

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:29.120
will not register and you will have to claim the tower all over again once you have done a tower

02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:34.560
you never have to go back up it there is no uh treasure chest added on top of the tower there

02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:45.200
are no flags added on top of the tower um yes i don't worry i love every second of your conversation

02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:52.480
yeah i do like my conversational topic uh the game will always give you a way up fast if

02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:57.280
they've kind of put you in a thingy because they literally leave you in the water after that

02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:03.680
sequence and i was like okay then i guess we will call a horse very quickly or we'll steal a horse

02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:12.240
but a really strange developmental fact is um depending on the horse's color depends on its

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:20.320
speed in the game the lighter and whiter the horses the slower it is and then obviously it goes up to

02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:24.720
all the way to a black horse and a black horse is the fastest horse you can get in the game

02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:29.760
i don't know why the developers did it like that um but i noticed it as soon as i like started

02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:34.800
playing the game i was like huh why did they do this it seems like such a random thing um

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:40.080
but we're on a dark brown horse which is the second fastest so we got here lickety split

02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:46.160
but if you can somehow memorize the speed of that horse when we get on a white one uh yeah

02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:51.120
it'll be so slow in comparison now that the pope's dogs have fled we're talking about horses

02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:58.960
still right yeah it's great play the game i will show you literally i don't know why the devs

02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:03.360
don't know well when you approve the fact that's a true fact i don't that's group of things

02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:13.440
oh yeah my all account got restricted and i had to pass like a 10 sec like 10 captures and i can't

02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:18.400
be bothered doing it so my account's just restricted right now i'm so freaking lazy it like makes me do

02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:25.120
like these 10 things over and over and i failed it the first time and i'm like go and stop playing

02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:32.240
like you know full well i'm a human all i did was retweet someone artwork of me and then it

02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:40.000
blocked my account again i've done it like three times now i keep getting it like horses are like

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:49.360
cars red car go first as you can see this board shows the ranks of our top warrior again uh same

02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:54.480
thing as before if we improve the mercenaries they get cheaper i don't know if they get more effective

02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:59.840
cannot prove that i don't know if they get more aggressive and successful you also have fun

02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:07.120
now if you'll excuse me a bit silly in it yes it's silly brb you got walk home please do not get

02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:15.200
snatched on your way home where is bartholomeo at the fight downstairs he has such an aggressive

02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:27.200
view of the world the red ones go faster oh we're unlocking assassin mission contracts as well

02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:31.680
you get some florns on the side super easy super quick if you unlock your assassin signals

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:43.120
and do these really fast not a problem we will do a pee break in about like five minutes time

02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:50.320
okay now we are going to be able to utilize the aqueduct in order to get a lot closer because

02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:55.680
if you see the meters it says we're 1000 meters away we go to the island tabirina that's the

02:19:55.680 --> 02:20:01.520
closest we have unlocked to the thieves at the moment it wasn't kind of the market

02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:08.960
is that that may be true i actually don't know if they get more plentiful the like higher you

02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:11.680
under your the higher like tier you are with them

02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:22.080
jeez it's almost just killed myself from that board there goodness all right they came out

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:27.440
there we are we do have to run for this but again unless i take this guy's horse you don't want

02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:36.800
mine now yonkers thank you very much please okay out my way so this is the problem if the if you

02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:41.680
gallop through crowds the horse will fall over but if you just sprint through crowds the horse

02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:50.320
won't fall over um literally we commit grand theft horse say apologies to that guy he probably

02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:56.240
spent thousands of florns on the horse and i've just ran away with it and you get to keep the horse

02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:00.720
i've still not unlocked targets so we're not going to do that we're just going to swim

02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:08.000
across the water really quick we the pirate ship always stays after you have done that i don't know

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:16.160
why but the asset does get reused in a Leonardo mission so it's not like a massive waste so we

02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:21.440
are now currently trying to run out of range of the horse that's across the water because if we

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:26.320
call on it it's going to try and okay there we go we're out of range so we can spawn in the horse

02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:31.920
at any point but uh it will try to come over from the other side of the water and it can't

02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:36.800
so you need to go out of range to despawn it and then you can respawn it on the other side

02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:41.360
fucking hell this horse is zooming my god what kind of hay did we give it

02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:51.200
it's so fat why are we going so fat i need to help it oh my god that was dangerous that was

02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:54.800
dangerous like didn't even got a helmet on he's not even got we crashed pads on

02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:01.680
this is Lavalpe the owner of the tea skill horse doping honestly

02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:10.000
i know the answer you always do you want to put my spies to work then go in aiding

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:15.200
Machiavelli no thank you the horse really gotta go fast should have made it blue like

02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:26.240
panic bang bang a wee baggie to the horse we baggie is slang for

02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:36.400
yeah i think you can you can get the rest from there he is an assassin not a traitor

02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:41.360
i am not convinced a what a wee baggie means

02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:54.640
care to accompany me so Lavalpe thinks that Machiavelli is a traitor to the assassin's guild

02:22:54.640 --> 02:23:02.160
which is the reason why Lavalpe refuses to communicate with Machiavelli uh can i get a

02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:06.000
horse please because this is going to take a while to get to the location we need to get

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:13.360
hello let's go right let's get out of the way of the humans because the humans are in the way

02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:21.840
um after this we gain notoriety unfortunately which means there are gonna be

02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:26.400
posters put up about us and they kind of pop up on the map a bit too

02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:28.960
a bit too much and they're always like above

02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:36.480
money oh yeah we're at six thousand that's not honestly that's not bad

02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:43.200
um we are gonna try and get a crossbow bolt you can unlock a crossbow bolt just like the archers

02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:50.160
but you need to pay for it and i think it's 13 000 florins and if you decide to invest in buildings

02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:57.120
like boot i keep saying butchers like the blacksmith for example and it does like

02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:04.720
it adds up over time but it kind of is a bit difficult it's better to like save your money

02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:13.040
for the quest because you can easily defeat the section after oh you like my twitter picture yeah

02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:20.800
yeah i totally made it myself i did not make it i didn't make it at all i yanked it

02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:30.640
okay okay this pay attention look at his body and look at him holding his arm please make note of

02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:36.480
this as his i know it sounds crazy but i'm gonna talk about reusing assets and how genius it is

02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:42.880
in video game development okay so he is hunched over and he's holding his arm please keep this in

02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:52.160
your mind okay let's see if i can shoot everyone right you first right you next right you next okay

02:24:52.160 --> 02:25:05.680
you know how about you okay oh oh hey let's go baby do you guys see the behind of the scenes

02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:09.760
and lord of the rings where gimley's like right you first right you next you'll come to me i'll

02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:15.200
beat you up right you next right you next that's basically what we just did okay now this section

02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:21.120
is actually super easy it was really hard at first we might get caught because i'm he gets lost so

02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:29.920
quickly but basically you have to hide here and then we're gonna wait for a group to walk up and

02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:35.440
then they will see that group there that's coming towards us we hide in that group and then that's

02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:40.800
it we've done this section of the game but please make a note of his body how he's holding his arm

02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:45.920
and he's kind of hunched over because i'm gonna show you a reused asset you might not know about

02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:50.240
wait why why is that group highlighted hold on a minute am i supposed to be with the other there's

02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:58.400
too many groups please please okay you okay i hate this bit because the tree gets in the way

02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:03.760
yes you heard me right the tree gets in the way and breaks up the group often but we're just gonna

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:14.080
blend in don't look at us guards we're just citizens i'm a monk amen amen i don't know what monks say

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:23.680
and then tada oh excuse me you are right there and he's like that could have desynchronized

02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:27.120
because he got caught on those people i'm not even kidding i'm not kidding

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:37.040
analizing asset analizing well this asset be reused later yes it will

02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:42.560
you know how to disappear

02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:51.120
if you flora you know how to disappear heck yeah

02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:57.840
okay we are gonna take a pee break right after we've done this bit because i need to pee

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:07.920
and i'm gonna get more water because i'm out of water already so these are witnesses we lose 75

02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:13.360
percent notoriety if we do that and we are also going to complete a thieves challenge

02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:20.800
which is drum roll please is to pick pocket 500 florins and a really quick way to do it is by this

02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:27.440
you pick bribe him 500 and then yuck easy come easy go baby

02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:36.160
and then oh i still have notoriety um that's not supposed to happen it's supposed to disappear at

02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:42.000
this point excuse me whilst i kill this other witness oh no there's guards you know what i can

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:54.480

pause pause pause we did it we did it we snuck on him oh my god we snuck up on him oh my god it's

02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:24.000
normally so hard to do talk about opportunistic killing my goodness okay we've just secured

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:30.000
like a third borja tower oh my goodness i can't believe the timing just happened

02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:37.120
oh that was perfect timing i could not have asked for better oh my god i could not have asked for

02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:43.040

02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:49.600
okay we're gonna burn this tower there are a few archers on the roof but uh they're not too much

02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:55.120
of a bother all right you can just kind of you know unfortunately you do have this one's a bit

02:28:55.120 --> 02:29:00.640
more awkward you have to like you have to like kill him and then you have to go up there and kill

02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:08.480
this guy too and it's a bit annoying to navigate whoopsie oh wow i made that jump there's a guard

02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:16.480
down there but you don't have to kill him if you don't get down nope i will take your get down get

02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:51.040
synchronization point for the map boom synchronization yeah i used to watch a lot of hadsuni miko mmds

the thieves guild and upgrade it and then that is i was done with dna sequence three question mark

02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:52.800

02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:56.080
I keep wanting to call it the Butchers, the blacksmith.

02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:02.080
Did you guys pee and get water and stretch your legs instead?

02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:08.080
I don't even drink energy drinks.

02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:12.080
I'm eating meat and trying to play at the same time.

02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:18.080
My mouth is stuffed full of meat.

02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:28.080
Beecherbers when they're trying to do the most clippiest bait clip I've ever heard.

02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:32.080
My mouth is so full of meat.

02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:36.080
We got it. We know what game you're playing. It's fine.

02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:46.080
I'm finishing it.

02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:48.080
Sorry for the people that don't like mouth sounds. I apologize.

02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.080
I actually can't remember what happens in this sequence.

02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:58.080
My brain is blanking.

02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:06.080
Well, it looks like I should have taken the aqueduct.

02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:08.080
We're going into the castello.

02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:14.080
We're about to go see Catherine of Forley.

02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:16.080
Catherine of Forley.

02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:20.080
She's currently stuck in a jail. She's got the jail.

02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:24.080
The police in Scotland have got polis.

02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:28.080
Actually, that's how you say it in Gaelic as well.

02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:30.080
You say polis.

02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:32.080
What are you eating?

02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:34.080
I said a stick of meat.

02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:36.080
It's like a pepper-rami.

02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:40.080
But it's called a twizzle stick or something.

02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:42.080
Oh, shit, I don't want to get in trouble.

02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:44.080
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:46.080
Excuse me.

02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:48.080
Come through.

02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:50.080
That's what I didn't want to happen.

02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:54.080
Because I'm literally just trying to get into a memory right now.

02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:58.080
Excuse me. Pardon me. Didn't mean anything.

02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:03.080
Well, you could've ignored me, but no, no, oh, are they still looking for me?

02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:06.560
So that indicator means they're still looking, but they've not been coded to come down the

02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:07.560
stairs or something?

02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:11.680
Cause, yeah, they should've came down there, but they didn't.

02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:14.080
Well I ain't complaining, I've never gotten in trouble, hee hee.

02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:15.080
BOO!

02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:18.080
Yeah, now, do you see that flashbang?

02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:19.080
How does Haggis taste?

02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:21.080
I actually really like it.

02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:24.080
SHE HORROR FORLY!

02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:33.080
I drinking lots of water to stop the neon.

02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:48.080
What's Haggis?

02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:50.080
Haggis is a meat dish.

02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:54.080
I'll be free, your time will come, I swear it!

02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:56.080
Keep your eyes on her eyes.

02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:58.080
You're going to torture her.

02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:01.080
You are here for Cesare and Rodrigo.

02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:04.080
Girl spent in fire.

02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:06.080
If we help her now while she is weak.

02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:09.080
Haggis is a meat dish, a native national...

02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:11.080
Let's kill Cesare and Rodrigo first.

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:14.080
It's not our national dish, I don't think.

02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:16.080
Who goes there?

02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:19.080
By the Pope.

02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:23.080
I ate and I had a bit of water, so that didn't work.

02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:29.080
It is, I believe, sheep liver and sheep lung mashed up.

02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:33.080
And it's quite peppery, quite a peppery dish.

02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:35.080
It's really nice.

02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:38.080
You might have heard the phrase, neeps and tatis.

02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:40.080
That means potatoes and turnip.

02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:42.080
And it's just like a nice mash together.

02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:43.080
It's really nice, I like it.

02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:47.080
Okay, so this one's like, don't get caught, but I couldn't get...

02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:50.080
What will they do?

02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:52.080
Don't get detected later?

02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:54.080
Because I actually don't even know how to do it.

02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:56.080
So we're going to do it for the first time together.

02:48:56.080 --> 02:49:00.080
I've never done this section without being caught.

02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:04.080
I assume maybe if I had a crossbow and it can kill from afar and resupply.

02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:06.080
Isn't Haggis a wee rodent?

02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:09.080
Oh, aye, it's a wee animal.

02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:16.080
Haggis is mainly pork, is it?

02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:25.080
I don't think it's easily accessible, like, outside of the United Kingdom.

02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:29.080
It is referred to as blood pudding.

02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:30.080
Oh, no, that's black.

02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:32.080
Black pudding is different.

02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:38.080
For breakfast, we do like, it's a discus.

02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:43.080
So on the way, a discus of, it's called black pudding,

02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:46.080
but Americans refer to it as blood pudding.

02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:49.080
But it is made of blood, so I do understand why they call it that.

02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:52.080
It's just we call it, it just sounds a bit barbaric.

02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:57.080
But at the same time, it's like, well, we are eating, you know what I mean?

02:49:57.080 --> 02:49:59.080
No one cares.

02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:04.080
Greetings, greetings.

02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:06.080
You really say greens?

02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:10.080
Alright, let's kill him from above.

02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:12.080
Thank you very much.

02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:15.080
We are going to have to come back on this.

02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:21.080
Haggis is a savoury pudding containing sheeps,

02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:27.080
sheeps pluck, minced with chopped onion, oatmeal, the spices and salt mixed with stock

02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:29.080
and cooked with traditional, da da da da da.

02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:33.080
I don't know how I could do that in the corner of my eye, but here you go.

02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:38.080
I actually played this game so many times, I'm like completely sequenced out the wazoo.

02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:42.080
But yeah, I'm a bit confused how you're supposed to do this section

02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:44.080
without being caught without a crossbow.

02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:47.080
I think we'll get access to the crossbow when we replay the memory.

02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:51.080
Oh no, go away. See that's the thing.

02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:54.080
Oh my god, no, no, no.

02:50:54.080 --> 02:51:01.080
By the skin of our teeth, did that man not shoot?

02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:05.080
Oh my gosh.

02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:11.080
By the skill, by the skin of our teeth, by our gamer skills as well.

02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:13.080
Yes, I give it to my gamer skills.

02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:16.080
Oh my gosh.

02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:19.080
Must have been the wind, literally.

02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:21.080
Their brother and sister, by the way.

02:51:30.080 --> 02:51:32.080
How it left so shut.

02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:35.080
I'd rather like it open myself.

02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:41.080
Have you talked to the Pope about the funds requested by my banker?

02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:43.080
He is away from the Castello.

02:51:43.080 --> 02:51:46.080
I do need some convincing when he returns.

02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:48.080
That shouldn't be a problem.

02:51:48.080 --> 02:51:50.080
Should it?

02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:52.080
I wish that was me for real, for real.

02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:55.080
Only it gets quite lonely here.

02:51:55.080 --> 02:51:58.080
You and I spend so little time together.

02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:01.080
Busy as you are with your other conquests.

02:52:01.080 --> 02:52:05.080
Once I have secured the throne of Italia,

02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:10.080
you are going to be my queen and your loneliness.

02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:12.080
We'll be a thing of the past.

02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:14.080
Ashight, baby.

02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:16.080
Oh!

02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:18.080
A bit of hair yonking.

02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:19.080
We need to tag this up.

02:52:19.080 --> 02:52:21.080
We need to tag this stream up to high heaven.

02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:25.080
We've got hair yonking, we've got kissing, we've got bin best.

02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:28.080
A lot of things going on.

02:52:28.080 --> 02:52:31.080
I'm not to go up, I think I'm to swing to the side.

02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:33.080
Yeah, surely.

02:52:33.080 --> 02:52:35.080
Imagine if I went the wrong way.

02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:37.080
Right now.

02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:39.080
Hold B and then you just grab onto everything.

02:52:39.080 --> 02:52:42.080
You can go down and speak things of it.

02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:44.080
And what was it?

02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:49.080
His ball was like one black thing shriveled up or something like that.

02:52:49.080 --> 02:52:52.080
That Spaniard guy.

02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:55.080
The Spanish were wild then.

02:52:56.080 --> 02:52:58.080
To even get to that stage.

02:52:58.080 --> 02:53:01.080
Not going to lie, not going to lie.

02:53:01.080 --> 02:53:03.080
Who goes there?

02:53:03.080 --> 02:53:05.080
Identify yourself.

02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:07.080
What do we need to go up?

02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:09.080
Square Sausage.

02:53:09.080 --> 02:53:11.080
I miss square sausage.

02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:15.080
If you didn't know, in Chicky Scotland for breakfast you do square sausage

02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:19.080
and it's literally a square of sausage meat.

02:53:19.080 --> 02:53:21.080
I wish it.

02:53:21.080 --> 02:53:24.080
And I have it on a rolled way onion.

02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:26.080
Didn't you just have his private...

02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:28.080
I can't remember.

02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:43.080
Whammin' on whammin' violence.

02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:46.080
It can be.

02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:48.080
You can put tomato sauce on it.

02:53:48.080 --> 02:53:53.080
It's like tomato sauce, fried onion in square sausage on a roll.

02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:54.080
Simple.

02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:56.080
Simple, bruv.

02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:58.080
Can I get more simple on that?

02:53:58.080 --> 02:54:00.080
Right on the hip as well.

02:54:00.080 --> 02:54:02.080
Excuse me.

02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:04.080
Sorry, that actually really hurt.

02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:06.080
I need a safe word.

02:54:06.080 --> 02:54:08.080
That actually really hurt.

02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:10.080
Please don't do that again.

02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:14.080
Right, I'm pretty sure for this sequence if you time it right

02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:17.080
you can be like not detected by the guards somehow.

02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:19.080
Yeah, like literally he doesn't...

02:54:19.080 --> 02:54:26.080
Yeah, so at least we know that for when we do play the 100% not detection segment.

02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:31.080
And then there should be a guard to our left.

02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:36.080
Well, we don't need to not be detected right now so it's fine.

02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:38.080
The safe word is more...

02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:40.080
What do you think is still it?

02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:44.080
Should be in the safe word for a sheepskater.

02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:46.080
Can you reach this water jug for me?

02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:49.080
Okay, kill that guard first and then kill him.

02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:51.080
And then that'll be how we won't get detected.

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:53.080
Surely.

02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:55.080
Yay!

02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:57.080
Castello crashing.

02:54:57.080 --> 02:54:59.080
Paying a visit to the tailor.

02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:04.080
Brown sauce and I'm not brown sauce fan sauce.

02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:08.080
A bit of Harry Potter sauce with HP sauce.

02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:11.080
It's tomato sauce or ketchup?

02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:13.080
I'm gonna say something really dumb.

02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:20.080
I don't know the difference between tomato ketchup and tomato sauce and tomato ketchup.

02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:23.080
Ain't they the same? Aren't they the same?

02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:26.080
Aren't they the same?

02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:31.080
Phil Sinkfield, yes, we will be coming back to Fully Sink later thing right now.

02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:33.080
Oh my god, that poor guy.

02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:36.080
I didn't even know he was in here. I thought she was the only one here.

02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:42.080
Brand? One has sugar, one doesn't.

02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:46.080
I guess tomato sauce is probably what I like then.

02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:51.080
This section can be a little bit finicky.

02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:53.080
I love you so.

02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:56.080
I want to sing it from the heavens.

02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:59.080
Please, you must whisper it only to yourself.

02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:01.080
If Cesare found out who knows what he would do.

02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:04.080
These hoes ain't loyal.

02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:06.080
He killed my husband.

02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:08.080
Oh.

02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:11.080
He killed my husband.

02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:13.080
For real, for real.

02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:16.080
I'm late for rehearsal. Farewell, my love.

02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:18.080
No, ketchup has way more sugar than other ingredients.

02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:20.080
Oh my god, not kidding.

02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:22.080
She got a point. Ketchup has a ton of sugar.

02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:25.080
Okay, whatever the sugary one was, I like it.

02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:27.080
Brain says yum.

02:56:27.080 --> 02:56:30.080
We shall see how it feels when the shoe is on the other foot.

02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:32.080
Oh.

02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:34.080
She's playing.

02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:36.080
She said, guess what?

02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:39.080
I'm not the only one that's going cheating around here.

02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:44.080
He loves me.

02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:48.080
Oh, she's like actually animating the flower and stuff.

02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:52.080
Hello.

02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:55.080
Imagine counting flowers and someone just goes,

02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:57.080
wow.

02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:01.080
Oh my god, I think I would have a heart attack.

02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:08.080
I would have enjoyed this.

02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:10.080
Guards.

02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:12.080
Jump on you and say hello.

02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:14.080
That's what happens in the ASMR booth.

02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:17.080
What happens in the booth stays in the booth.

02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:20.080
I see that premium pass around your neck.

02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:22.080
I'm jumping on you.

02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:24.080
Thanks for supporting me.

02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:26.080
I just have to wait for these guys to attack

02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:28.080
because they are such a nightmare.

02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:32.080
Literally, it's just so much faster to let them attack

02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:34.080
and then...

02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:38.080
Right.

02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:40.080
Oh, I think I just net.

02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:44.080
The jump scare.

02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:47.080
Foxy jump scare.

02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:50.080
Princesses from Kessels now.

02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:53.080
Ora, ora, ora.

02:57:53.080 --> 02:57:55.080
Right, so this is really awkward.

02:57:55.080 --> 02:57:59.080
If Lucretia gets away, like back to that starting station,

02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:01.080
she will spawn out of bounds

02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:03.080
and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it

02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:05.080
and you have to restart this section again.

02:58:05.080 --> 02:58:07.080
It's so annoying.

02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:11.080
Thankfully, the last few times I've played this game,

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:15.080
it's not happened, but when it does happen, it's so annoying.

02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:18.080
Oh my god, it's so annoying, Lucretia.

02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:21.080
If you can get...

02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:23.080
Excuse me, I wasn't even putting her down

02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:26.080
and you just whapped me with that frickin' weapon.

02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:28.080
Stop it!

02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:30.080
You're upsetting me!

02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:32.080
Don't upset me!

02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:34.080
Oh my god, please do not do a finishing move

02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:37.080
if she gets away because I was busy doing a finishing move

02:58:37.080 --> 02:58:39.080
to look really good.

02:58:39.080 --> 02:58:42.080
The passing was, your hand was finished

02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:45.080
and their memory's erased.

02:58:45.080 --> 02:58:48.080
Oh no, the tombstone's erased.

02:58:53.080 --> 02:58:55.080
See, she does that.

02:58:55.080 --> 02:58:58.080
See, if she jumps out, you have to go grab her.

02:58:58.080 --> 02:59:01.080
However, if the people are attacking you,

02:59:01.080 --> 02:59:05.080
then she'll wait on the side patiently for you to kill them.

02:59:05.080 --> 02:59:07.080
Oh my god, is she actually getting away?

02:59:07.080 --> 02:59:09.080
I'm getting nervous.

02:59:09.080 --> 02:59:12.080
Stop it, Lucretia!

02:59:12.080 --> 02:59:15.080
Hen, Hen, calm down, let me just kidnap you.

02:59:15.080 --> 02:59:18.080
I mean, come on, come on, let me just kidnap you, okay?

02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:20.080
Let me just kidnap you.

02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:22.080
Shhh!

02:59:22.080 --> 02:59:24.080
You like it really, come on.

02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:26.080
Your man's not gaining any attention

02:59:26.080 --> 02:59:29.080
and look at me, I'm picking you up, I'm throwing you a boot.

02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:31.080
This is exactly what you're wanting, Hen.

02:59:31.080 --> 02:59:33.080
Lucretia, didn't you fight that?

02:59:33.080 --> 02:59:35.080
Didn't you actually fight that?

02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:42.080
Okay, shhh, that's right, that's right, just accept it.

02:59:44.080 --> 02:59:47.080
Shhh, this is so weird, I'm sorry.

02:59:50.080 --> 02:59:52.080
My words are wasted.

02:59:52.080 --> 02:59:53.080
Hippocrita!

02:59:53.080 --> 02:59:54.080
No!

02:59:54.080 --> 02:59:56.080
No, come on.

02:59:57.080 --> 02:59:59.080
Okay, we did it.

03:00:00.080 --> 03:00:02.080
Hippocrita!

03:00:03.080 --> 03:00:05.080
Just kidnap me, Strony.

03:00:10.080 --> 03:00:12.080
Crank sale, those are some big words.

03:00:12.080 --> 03:00:14.080
You're not supposed to say that stuff.

03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:16.080
Pip sweat detected.

03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:20.080
Strony be taking tips from Mercy.

03:00:20.080 --> 03:00:22.080
That's enough out of you.

03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:28.080
He's smart, I can't read him.

03:00:29.080 --> 03:00:31.080
Okay.

03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:33.080
Do not be detected.

03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:35.080
Again, another do not be detected.

03:00:35.080 --> 03:00:37.080
But there's two guards literally dead ahead.

03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:39.080
How am I not to be detected by them

03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:41.080
when we play this for people?

03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:43.080
Did they come in here?

03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:45.080
No, this cannot be.

03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:47.080
Did they actually come in here?

03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:52.080
Okay, one gets his...

03:00:55.080 --> 03:00:57.080
No, okay.

03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:00.080
How am I supposed to deal with two of them at once

03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:02.080
when we do it for real?

03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:06.080
Eh, you better calm down, hen.

03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:08.080
I'm rescuing you, Christina.

03:01:08.080 --> 03:01:10.080
Then you get on at me about taking so long.

03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:12.080
What are you doing?

03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:15.080
Catarina.

03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:18.080
I can't wait to hear your ASMR streams.

03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:21.080
Oh, it's just absolute word vomit, I promise you.

03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:23.080
Absolutely nothing makes sense.

03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:25.080
My accent gets a little off the wee bit when I whisper,

03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:27.080
but it's not really a big deal.

03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:29.080
Like, I can make it...

03:01:29.080 --> 03:01:31.080
I can enhance.

03:01:34.080 --> 03:01:36.080
All about that?

03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:38.080
Yes, yes, yes.

03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:39.080
I know.

03:01:39.080 --> 03:01:41.080
You gave me your hole, so I'd protect you.

03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:42.080
It's... oh.

03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:43.080
Hello.

03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:44.080
Bye-bye.

03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:45.080
Hello.

03:01:45.080 --> 03:01:47.080
Bye-bye.

03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:51.080
I do be a really skilled assassin, honestly.

03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:53.080
Ready?

03:01:57.080 --> 03:01:59.080
Where?

03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:04.080
He's just like me for real, for real.

03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:06.080
He literally went...

03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:10.080
Where actually is the auditorium?

03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:12.080
Confirmed.

03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:15.080
Never do that to me again.

03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:19.080
Man, they didn't even let her put on her dress and stuff.

03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:21.080
It's all torn at the bottom.

03:02:21.080 --> 03:02:23.080
Oh, also, you can walk on barrels.

03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:25.080
If you wanted to know that,

03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:28.080
you can like jump up on barrels while carrying people.

03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:33.080
It's just like a silly little goofy thing, but I like it.

03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:35.080
Okay.

03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:37.080
We pop you down there, pet the eagle,

03:02:37.080 --> 03:02:39.080
and then we just give a wee stabby stabby the eagle,

03:02:39.080 --> 03:02:41.080
all for you, mate.

03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:44.080
And we just pick up the lady again.

03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:46.080
And then basically...

03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:48.080
If you pop her down in the middle,

03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:52.080
I think you can access both gates without losing distance.

03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:56.080
It will warn you against distance if you get too far away from her,

03:02:56.080 --> 03:02:58.080
but...

03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:03.080
No, I was gonna walk away.

03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:06.080
I was gonna walk away and you forfeited your life.

03:03:07.080 --> 03:03:10.080
How could you be such a silly...

03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:13.080
I think we actually might have to move her over.

03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:16.080
Whoa, did you guys see what I just saw?

03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:18.080
Oh, leave me alone.

03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:19.080
No, no, you don't see me.

03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:20.080
I'm just going up the stairs.

03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:21.080
I'm just a tourist.

03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:22.080
I'm a visor, okay?

03:03:22.080 --> 03:03:24.080
I'm a visor of the...

03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:27.080
I thought I was gonna desync there.

03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:28.080
I got scared.

03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:30.080
I thought I was gonna desync there.

03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:34.080
I saw her panties.

03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:35.080
Shhh.

03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:38.080
And I didn't even have to pay anything.

03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:40.080
I saw them for free.

03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:42.080
Shhh.

03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:44.080
Wait, can that guy see me again?

03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:45.080
Oh!

03:03:45.080 --> 03:03:48.080
I think we're gonna have to do the old ear assassination.

03:03:51.080 --> 03:03:52.080
Excuse me, sir.

03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:54.080
I just moved over to do an ear assassination.

03:03:54.080 --> 03:03:55.080
Thank you.

03:03:58.080 --> 03:04:00.080
The audio is strange again.

03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:02.080
It better not be.

03:04:05.080 --> 03:04:07.080
Why?

03:04:07.080 --> 03:04:08.080
Why?

03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:11.080
Literally nothing has changed.

03:04:13.080 --> 03:04:15.080
I'm gonna tab in and out of the game multiple times.

03:04:15.080 --> 03:04:18.080
Okay, so it's gonna pause and then open back up

03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:21.080
and pause and open back up.

03:04:25.080 --> 03:04:27.080
There's a static noise.

03:04:27.080 --> 03:04:29.080
Sound like a static review.

03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:32.080
If I have to close the game again,

03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:34.080
I will.

03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:38.080
A desync warning.

03:04:38.080 --> 03:04:41.080
Like, it sounds perfectly fine for me.

03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:44.080
Still there?

03:04:45.080 --> 03:04:46.080
Shhh.

03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:54.080
Do I have to play this whole section again if I quit right now?

03:04:54.080 --> 03:04:56.080
It's still buzzing.

03:04:56.080 --> 03:04:58.080
Do you know what buzzing means in Scots?

03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:00.080
It means you're really having to play it now.

03:05:01.080 --> 03:05:04.080
A feature where I know you can just restart the audio capture?

03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:06.080
I mean, wait.

03:05:06.080 --> 03:05:09.080
Hold on, controversial move, I know.

03:05:11.080 --> 03:05:13.080
How does that sound?

03:05:14.080 --> 03:05:16.080
Does that sound normal?

03:05:18.080 --> 03:05:22.080
I am now capturing my desktop audio instead of the game.

03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:26.080
Okay, I can now, you're literally gonna hear

03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:30.080
if one of the girls DM me on Discord, that's the only thing.

03:05:32.080 --> 03:05:34.080
Okay, let's get across the bridge.

03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:36.080
Risky, I know you're all gonna know that.

03:05:36.080 --> 03:05:40.080
I've arranged another ASMR collab.

03:05:40.080 --> 03:05:44.080
Like, literally 30 minutes before the stream started.

03:05:44.080 --> 03:05:47.080
I burst into someone's DMs on Twitter.

03:05:47.080 --> 03:05:50.080
And I was like, hey girl, do you wanna add me?

03:05:50.080 --> 03:05:53.080
And then I was talking through my ASMR collab.

03:05:53.080 --> 03:05:55.080
And I've already planned it.

03:05:55.080 --> 03:05:59.080
It's not a big ASMR, it goes on her channel and all that jazz, but yeah.

03:06:00.080 --> 03:06:03.080
Okay, we have a timer, we basically just have to survive.

03:06:03.080 --> 03:06:07.080
So this is where you can get the serial killer achievement again,

03:06:07.080 --> 03:06:09.080
but it gets a bit iffy.

03:06:10.080 --> 03:06:13.080
It's not the best, I will mess up.

03:06:13.080 --> 03:06:18.080
And where the enemies go away, citizen, I don't wanna kill anymore.

03:06:20.080 --> 03:06:22.080
I'm gonna try and kill the wee guys first,

03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:26.080
because they grab me like that and ruin my streak.

03:06:29.080 --> 03:06:31.080
Okay, sorry, I'm focusing.

03:06:31.080 --> 03:06:34.080
See when they grab you, it takes you out of your kill streak advantage.

03:06:34.080 --> 03:06:36.080
And there's Lancers as well, I can see that Lancer.

03:06:36.080 --> 03:06:38.080
I'm gonna try and take him out in the kill streak.

03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:40.080
Okay.

03:06:41.080 --> 03:06:44.080
I'm trying to get the Lancer and it keeps all into the other guys.

03:06:46.080 --> 03:06:47.080
Come on.

03:06:47.080 --> 03:06:48.080
Wee guy next.

03:06:49.080 --> 03:06:51.080
Armor guy next, I guess.

03:06:51.080 --> 03:06:54.080
He's probably the best, but okay, I can't break his armor.

03:06:54.080 --> 03:06:56.080
So I'm just gonna go for the wee guy.

03:06:57.080 --> 03:06:58.080
Okay.

03:06:59.080 --> 03:07:01.080
We're getting there, we're getting there, 30 more seconds.

03:07:01.080 --> 03:07:03.080
Do not grab me.

03:07:03.080 --> 03:07:04.080
I hate when they grab me.

03:07:04.080 --> 03:07:06.080
Oh no, no, no, not the horse.

03:07:06.080 --> 03:07:08.080
Not the horse, not the horse.

03:07:10.080 --> 03:07:12.080
I said I'm hiding from the horse, get me in the hay bale.

03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:16.080
I'm scared of the horses.

03:07:16.080 --> 03:07:18.080
I actually don't know how to take down horse guys.

03:07:20.080 --> 03:07:21.080
Ouch.

03:07:21.080 --> 03:07:23.080
Yeah, this is why I don't like the horse guy.

03:07:23.080 --> 03:07:26.080
We got seven seconds, we just need to not get hit.

03:07:26.080 --> 03:07:29.080
Because we can run away in two seconds.

03:07:29.080 --> 03:07:32.080
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:07:33.080 --> 03:07:34.080
Wee.

03:07:37.080 --> 03:07:38.080
Oh my god.

03:07:39.080 --> 03:07:44.080
Okay, so in this sequence, you just need to get out a range of the yellow on the map.

03:07:44.080 --> 03:07:50.080
If you come on the roof, you can basically run along it as much as you need.

03:07:50.080 --> 03:07:57.080
Or if you don't like rooftop scaling, there is boats down to the left where you can get out a range.

03:07:58.080 --> 03:07:59.080
Down, down, down.

03:08:01.080 --> 03:08:03.080
Bruh, bruh, get off.

03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:05.080
My roof, no.

03:08:06.080 --> 03:08:12.080
And then if we disappear in the water maybe, I think we can hide in the water.

03:08:13.080 --> 03:08:15.080
You can like literally hide in the water.

03:08:16.080 --> 03:08:18.080
I'm a call fish, let's go.

03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:20.080
Can they see me?

03:08:21.080 --> 03:08:27.080
Physically, yes they can see me, but game development wise?

03:08:27.080 --> 03:08:30.080
No, they can't, so I enjoyed that.

03:08:30.080 --> 03:08:32.080
Do that again, more game please.

03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:35.080
Okay, we're gonna kill this guy.

03:08:35.080 --> 03:08:38.080
Sorry, I'm sorry mate, your time is up.

03:08:39.080 --> 03:08:40.080
Oh, I forget.

03:08:41.080 --> 03:08:44.080
Okay, if you scare away, you won't be able to...

03:08:44.080 --> 03:08:48.080
Right, we're gonna go for this poster just because I don't want guards to attack you on site.

03:08:49.080 --> 03:08:52.080
If you are the highest notoriety, they will attack you.

03:08:53.080 --> 03:08:57.080
Oh, the poster is down here, I have been fooled.

03:08:57.080 --> 03:08:59.080
The egg is on my face.

03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:11.080
We need to now go back to the island hideout because Caterina's forces are there.

03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:20.080
And then we can unlock assassin recruits and then we're really gonna get into the meat of the game and I love it.

03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:23.080
And everything is so cool, everything's so awesome.

03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:28.080
We're just gonna, alright, here we go, yank.

03:09:28.080 --> 03:09:31.080
He said enough, I yanked him off for heart, enough.

03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:33.080
Enough.

03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:35.080
Is it enough?

03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:38.080
Don't you not want to give more?

03:09:42.080 --> 03:09:45.080
Okay, this is the only problem when navigating with a horse.

03:09:45.080 --> 03:09:51.080
You have to, you're like stuck to using whatever roads you've passed out and it gets really...

03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:07.080
Why would you bother just going down to it, folks?

03:10:08.080 --> 03:10:10.080
If you come on the roof, should you...

03:10:12.080 --> 03:10:15.080
I never even said that, that was you that said that.

03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:18.080
Normally I'm the one coming out with the outrageous...

03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:22.080
I just whistled for the horse whilst purchasing the bank.

03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:27.080
Hey, horse, can you come out here?

03:10:27.080 --> 03:10:29.080
Thanks, appreciate it.

03:10:29.080 --> 03:10:30.080
Like, oh, okay.

03:10:34.080 --> 03:10:38.080
Oh, we made 1.5 Florence.

03:10:38.080 --> 03:10:40.080
That's pretty good.

03:10:40.080 --> 03:10:44.080
I don't think we're gonna get the crossbow before the section that I'm hoping to get it by.

03:10:45.080 --> 03:10:47.080
I don't know why we lost all our money.

03:10:47.080 --> 03:10:48.080
Don't know how it happened.

03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:50.080
Something, something don't gamble at home, people.

03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:54.080
But may have lost all our money in that.

03:10:55.080 --> 03:10:57.080
Right, where is the bridge?

03:10:57.080 --> 03:10:59.080
The bridge is over here, okay.

03:11:01.080 --> 03:11:03.080
Gotta stay on them peasants.

03:11:04.080 --> 03:11:07.080
Horse is the first customer of the store, for real, for real.

03:11:07.080 --> 03:11:09.080
Munching on that hay.

03:11:13.080 --> 03:11:15.080
Okay, we have made it to the island.

03:11:17.080 --> 03:11:20.080
Never gamble with your own money, gamble with someone else's, that's terrible.

03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:22.080
Don't gamble at all.

03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:24.080
Save that mule.

03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:26.080
I could not find him.

03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:29.080
Get yourself a wee fizzy juice from the corner shop.

03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:31.080
Maybe a wee bakery, a wee scone.

03:11:31.080 --> 03:11:33.080
To treat those things.

03:11:35.080 --> 03:11:37.080
The bank is in the room.

03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:40.080
Okay.

03:11:44.080 --> 03:11:45.080
Wow.

03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:48.080
It's normally outcast.

03:11:49.080 --> 03:11:50.080
Very odd indeed.

03:11:51.080 --> 03:11:52.080
What a waste.

03:11:52.080 --> 03:11:58.080
So the Volpe thinks that Marquee Valley tipped off Cesare to leave the castle.

03:11:59.080 --> 03:12:01.080
So we're all suspicious.

03:12:03.080 --> 03:12:05.080
Cesare commands a massive army in Romania.

03:12:06.080 --> 03:12:07.080
You would never reach it.

03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:09.080
I say we work here.

03:12:09.080 --> 03:12:10.080
Loma.

03:12:10.080 --> 03:12:13.080
They rode the Borja's influence while restoring our own.

03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:15.080
And in fact,

03:12:15.080 --> 03:12:17.080
I'm gonna start right now.

03:12:17.080 --> 03:12:18.080
Yes.

03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:19.080
We're doing it.

03:12:26.080 --> 03:12:27.080
We're doing it.

03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:28.080
We're about to get the brotherhood.

03:12:28.080 --> 03:12:29.080
Come on, reflings.

03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:31.080
I want to turn you guys into assassins.

03:12:32.080 --> 03:12:34.080
I want to turn you to deadly weapons.

03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:38.080
The Borja robbed everything from the people to maintain power.

03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:40.080
What do you intend to do?

03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:43.080
You will recruit him to our cause.

03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:44.080
You cannot be serious.

03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:46.080
To win this war, Marquee Valley.

03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:47.080
We need loyal soldiers.

03:12:47.080 --> 03:12:48.080
Come on, reflings.

03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:50.080
You'd let me draft you, right?

03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:54.080
All right, let's get drafted.

03:12:56.080 --> 03:12:58.080
I'm gonna be the combat medic on the battlefield.

03:12:58.080 --> 03:13:00.080
Okay, I'm healing you guys on the battlefield.

03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:02.080
With my...

03:13:03.080 --> 03:13:05.080
Oh, my God.

03:13:05.080 --> 03:13:07.080
The cutscene took so long that...

03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:08.080
Wait!

03:13:09.080 --> 03:13:11.080
Whoa, I've never seen this happen before.

03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:14.080
To recruit spawned and the cutscene took so long,

03:13:14.080 --> 03:13:16.080
they both died in the instants.

03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:18.080
Oh, my God.

03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:20.080
All right, she's still alive.

03:13:20.080 --> 03:13:21.080
Let's save her.

03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:22.080
Oh, my God.

03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:23.080
It's Shrek and...

03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:26.080
No, no, no, no, we've just attracted more guards.

03:13:26.080 --> 03:13:27.080
This is terrible.

03:13:27.080 --> 03:13:29.080
She has incredibly low health.

03:13:30.080 --> 03:13:31.080
Oh, goodness me.

03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:33.080
Oh, goodness gravy.

03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:35.080
Please don't perish.

03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:36.080
I hope she doesn't perish,

03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:37.080
cause we're actually gonna have to...

03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:39.080
Okay, she didn't perish, thank goodness.

03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:41.080
Already sold my life.

03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:42.080
One!

03:13:42.080 --> 03:13:44.080
What did you sell your life to?

03:13:46.080 --> 03:13:47.080
Sin?

03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:51.080
It's a lady assassin.

03:13:51.080 --> 03:13:54.080
You'll never guess what I do to the lady assassin.

03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:55.080
Okay, I'm gonna open up the map

03:13:55.080 --> 03:13:57.080
and the map will tell us where the next recruit is.

03:13:57.080 --> 03:13:59.080
So we can go recruit this person.

03:14:01.080 --> 03:14:06.080
And now we are about to unlock assassin recruit signals,

03:14:06.080 --> 03:14:08.080
which means in the middle of a fight

03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:11.080
we can literally ask the game to help us.

03:14:11.080 --> 03:14:13.080
And there's also a really fun minigame

03:14:13.080 --> 03:14:15.080
where you can level them up

03:14:15.080 --> 03:14:17.080
and make them even stronger to the point

03:14:17.080 --> 03:14:20.080
where they can fight incredibly strong enemies.

03:14:20.080 --> 03:14:24.080
And it is so satisfying watching their health bars go up.

03:14:24.080 --> 03:14:26.080
Oh, look, I have it already, actually.

03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:30.080
I'm gonna use it for this citizen.

03:14:30.080 --> 03:14:33.080
If I can get to them in time before they perish.

03:14:36.080 --> 03:14:37.080
Here we go.

03:14:37.080 --> 03:14:38.080
Oh, it's another lady.

03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:42.080
Oh my God, we're like doing all ladies in this assassin group.

03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:44.080
Oops, my bad.

03:14:44.080 --> 03:14:46.080
You can't really...

03:14:46.080 --> 03:14:48.080
Oh, okay.

03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:49.080
Hold on, let me go.

03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:50.080
Let me get up.

03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:51.080
Okay, we're...

03:14:51.080 --> 03:14:52.080
Oh my gosh.

03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:54.080
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

03:14:54.080 --> 03:14:56.080
More like the sisterhood.

03:14:56.080 --> 03:14:57.080
Am I right?

03:14:57.080 --> 03:14:58.080
Ha ha.

03:15:01.080 --> 03:15:03.080
Hopefully we can get a few guys in here.

03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:04.080
We need to repopulate Roma.

03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:05.080
You know what I'm saying?

03:15:05.080 --> 03:15:06.080
Yum yum yum yum.

03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:09.080
Let's unlock the doctors

03:15:09.080 --> 03:15:11.080
because we can get more money in general.

03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:14.080
Strong door calls for aid.

03:15:15.080 --> 03:15:17.080
Me on Christmas like.

03:15:18.080 --> 03:15:19.080
Okay.

03:15:20.080 --> 03:15:21.080
So...

03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:22.080
Lead...

03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:24.080
What did he say?

03:15:25.080 --> 03:15:27.080
I don't think I've ever heard that.

03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:30.080
I've got a new lead based cure for syphilis.

03:15:30.080 --> 03:15:33.080
I didn't know that was in the game.

03:15:33.080 --> 03:15:35.080
That's outrageous.

03:15:35.080 --> 03:15:39.080
Right, we're gonna go pick up this other assassin recruit

03:15:39.080 --> 03:15:41.080
because they're like 100 meters away.

03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:44.080
That's absolutely hilarious.

03:15:44.080 --> 03:15:49.080
And we're also gonna send one of our assassin recruits away on a mission

03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:52.080
which is how you level up the assassins

03:15:52.080 --> 03:15:55.080
and you get a stupendous amount of money for it.

03:15:57.080 --> 03:16:01.080
So I get 650 florins for 6 minutes I send this person away for.

03:16:01.080 --> 03:16:03.080
So this is your biggest money maker

03:16:03.080 --> 03:16:05.080
sending your assassin recruits away.

03:16:06.080 --> 03:16:08.080
So we might be able to get the crossbow ball

03:16:08.080 --> 03:16:11.080
if I dilly dally and do a few save quest things.

03:16:11.080 --> 03:16:13.080
Or we can just rush through.

03:16:13.080 --> 03:16:15.080
It's not really rushing because

03:16:15.080 --> 03:16:18.080
it's just playing the campaign but yeah.

03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:21.080
I'll have to say nothing is true.

03:16:21.080 --> 03:16:24.080
Everything is permitted for real.

03:16:24.080 --> 03:16:28.080
I'm training my reeflings to become weapons of destruction.

03:16:28.080 --> 03:16:30.080
Where's the citizen?

03:16:30.080 --> 03:16:32.080
Oh, they're already fighting.

03:16:32.080 --> 03:16:35.080
Oh, the citizen might die.

03:16:37.080 --> 03:16:40.080
Oh, why is this building so tall?

03:16:40.080 --> 03:16:42.080
Oh, can I get them?

03:16:42.080 --> 03:16:43.080
Can I save you?

03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:45.080
I'm coming, I'm coming.

03:16:45.080 --> 03:16:47.080
I'm helping, I'm helping.

03:16:47.080 --> 03:16:49.080
Okay, we got it, we got it, we got it.

03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:50.080
Okay, good.

03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:52.080
Oh no, there's more guards that have come in.

03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:54.080
Oh, I don't know how low his HP is.

03:16:54.080 --> 03:16:58.080
The recruits are so bad at the game as well.

03:16:58.080 --> 03:17:00.080
Oh, I'm so bad at the game.

03:17:00.080 --> 03:17:03.080
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

03:17:03.080 --> 03:17:05.080
Oh, come on, you can do it.

03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:06.080
Okay.

03:17:07.080 --> 03:17:08.080
Oh, we did it.

03:17:08.080 --> 03:17:10.080
I instantly you want to pick up the recruit

03:17:10.080 --> 03:17:13.080
because it gets rid of any guards that are nearby.

03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:16.080
Mere gracia, Amiko.

03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:22.080
Weapons of destruction.

03:17:22.080 --> 03:17:25.080
Achievements, brotherhood.

03:17:27.080 --> 03:17:31.080
If we had gamer score, we'd probably have like 200 venerals.

03:17:31.080 --> 03:17:33.080
Oh, these are the Borja zones that we've liberated.

03:17:33.080 --> 03:17:37.080
We've done three places, so we're allowed to have three recruits.

03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:42.080
We've done four places, excuse me, so we're allowed to have four recruits.

03:17:42.080 --> 03:17:44.080
I literally just remembered.

03:17:45.080 --> 03:17:50.080
We can go to the main quest, which is down here.

03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:53.080
There's actually someone we can recruit over here.

03:17:54.080 --> 03:17:57.080
Nah, we'll go to the main quest and we'll pick up recruits on the way.

03:17:57.080 --> 03:17:58.080
We've got a fill bar of recruits.

03:17:58.080 --> 03:18:01.080
Unfortunately, they're very weak, so it's not very good.

03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:03.080
I'm chasing after you, my recruit.

03:18:05.080 --> 03:18:09.080
It's not very good to send them to battle

03:18:09.080 --> 03:18:11.080
without kind of leveling them up first

03:18:11.080 --> 03:18:15.080
because your recruits can perish in a fight, unironically.

03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:21.080
Yeah, your assassins can die, it's very dangerous.

03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:27.080
Across the bridges are our first mission.

03:18:27.080 --> 03:18:31.080
These missions are all based around calling your assassin recruits in,

03:18:31.080 --> 03:18:35.080
but the bar does take exactly 60 seconds to refresh

03:18:35.080 --> 03:18:38.080
from when they disappear, not from when you call them in,

03:18:38.080 --> 03:18:40.080
from when they disappear off the map.

03:18:41.080 --> 03:18:46.080
And some of the missions, they take a hot second.

03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:49.080
It's good to get multiple bars of assassin recruits,

03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:52.080
so the more Borgia towers you destroy, the more recruits you're allowed,

03:18:52.080 --> 03:19:00.080
and you've got a maximum of three bars, so six Borgia towers.

03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:02.080
Where the heck am I going?

03:19:02.080 --> 03:19:04.080
Oh, this one, I remember.

03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:08.080
Hello, sorry to swing in about that over this very sad scene.

03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:10.080
Mafato!

03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:13.080
This is another multiplayer character that we kill.

03:19:13.080 --> 03:19:18.080
We must follow the whores,

03:19:18.080 --> 03:19:21.080
so they will point to where we need to go,

03:19:21.080 --> 03:19:24.080
but I have played this game many a time now,

03:19:24.080 --> 03:19:27.080
so you can just keep running in general.

03:19:27.080 --> 03:19:32.080
Running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running.

03:19:32.080 --> 03:19:35.080
Yeah, we do have our recruits ready to assassinate this guy,

03:19:35.080 --> 03:19:39.080
and we should get a tidy sum of money for doing so.

03:19:43.080 --> 03:19:45.080
I've actually never tried to break this sequence

03:19:45.080 --> 03:19:48.080
and go outside of what the girls point you to.

03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:54.080
I've called my recruit.

03:19:54.080 --> 03:19:55.080
I don't know where she is.

03:19:55.080 --> 03:19:56.080
She's taking her sweet time, right?

03:19:56.080 --> 03:19:57.080
There you go.

03:19:57.080 --> 03:19:58.080
Get him!

03:19:59.080 --> 03:20:01.080
And then with 100% of that,

03:20:01.080 --> 03:20:02.080
I'm going to shower.

03:20:02.080 --> 03:20:04.080
Hold on, let me pause the stream for you.

03:20:05.080 --> 03:20:06.080
I'm teasing.

03:20:06.080 --> 03:20:07.080
Enjoy your shower.

03:20:07.080 --> 03:20:09.080
Don't forget to do your belly button and behind your ears.

03:20:09.080 --> 03:20:11.080
A lot of people forget.

03:20:11.080 --> 03:20:13.080
And make sure you soap all over,

03:20:13.080 --> 03:20:15.080
even on your booty hole.

03:20:15.080 --> 03:20:18.080
Soap cleans itself due to the nature of it.

03:20:21.080 --> 03:20:24.080
Not that you're expecting a visitor anytime soon, are you?

03:20:29.080 --> 03:20:30.080
Do you get a lot of money if you loot?

03:20:30.080 --> 03:20:33.080
No, you don't get anything if you loot the multiplayer.

03:20:33.080 --> 03:20:35.080
Ooh, new recruit, let's get it.

03:20:39.080 --> 03:20:40.080
No, they're fighting.

03:20:40.080 --> 03:20:42.080
Stop fighting before I even get there.

03:20:42.080 --> 03:20:43.080
My goodness.

03:20:43.080 --> 03:20:44.080
Stop it!

03:20:44.080 --> 03:20:45.080
Stop it!

03:20:46.080 --> 03:20:47.080
I'm coming to hell.

03:20:47.080 --> 03:20:48.080
Give me a second.

03:20:48.080 --> 03:20:49.080
Let me cook.

03:20:49.080 --> 03:20:50.080
Oh, my God.

03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:52.080
I've just invited even more guards to come over.

03:20:53.080 --> 03:20:54.080
Oh, please don't.

03:20:54.080 --> 03:20:56.080
I don't know how damaged they is.

03:20:56.080 --> 03:20:58.080
Please don't do a cutscene.

03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:02.080
There's too many enemies around right now for this.

03:21:04.080 --> 03:21:05.080
Oh, oops.

03:21:06.080 --> 03:21:08.080
I am actually going to pick up these bodies

03:21:08.080 --> 03:21:10.080
and put them in the hay bale

03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:12.080
because if you put five in a hay bale,

03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:14.080
you do a cortisol challenge.

03:21:14.080 --> 03:21:15.080
I'm just going to do this now,

03:21:15.080 --> 03:21:16.080
so I'm not going to talk to them.

03:21:16.080 --> 03:21:18.080
I'm literally going to save his life

03:21:18.080 --> 03:21:19.080
and then just be like, excuse me,

03:21:19.080 --> 03:21:20.080
I'm just trying to hide the evidence

03:21:20.080 --> 03:21:22.080
of what we've just committed together.

03:21:29.080 --> 03:21:30.080
Mother Mary.

03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:32.080
No, not the sword.

03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:33.080
The body.

03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:34.080
No, the body.

03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:35.080
Thank you.

03:21:36.080 --> 03:21:38.080
No requiesce de parti.

03:21:41.080 --> 03:21:43.080
One more body should do it.

03:21:43.080 --> 03:21:45.080
No, not the weapon.

03:21:45.080 --> 03:21:46.080
The body.

03:21:47.080 --> 03:21:49.080
Taking out the trash.

03:21:49.080 --> 03:21:50.080
Taking out the trash.

03:21:52.080 --> 03:21:53.080
Okay, there we go.

03:21:54.080 --> 03:21:55.080
You know what always bothered me?

03:21:55.080 --> 03:21:56.080
When you kill some evil bloke

03:21:56.080 --> 03:21:59.080
and then Exo is cradling like a babysitter recipe,

03:22:00.080 --> 03:22:01.080
he has...

03:22:01.080 --> 03:22:03.080
Whoa, what was that?

03:22:03.080 --> 03:22:05.080
Was that scaffolding in that cutscene?

03:22:07.080 --> 03:22:09.080
The camera is so good in this game.

03:22:09.080 --> 03:22:10.080
Like it's so good.

03:22:12.080 --> 03:22:16.080
Do you guys remember the asset repeating?

03:22:17.080 --> 03:22:20.080
I'm going to show you an asset that was repeated.

03:22:20.080 --> 03:22:22.080
It's right in this next quest.

03:22:23.080 --> 03:22:25.080
So remember how he was holding his arm

03:22:25.080 --> 03:22:27.080
and he was injured?

03:22:27.080 --> 03:22:29.080
Well, guess what?

03:22:29.080 --> 03:22:31.080
This is where they reused the asset.

03:22:31.080 --> 03:22:33.080
On this little crying kid.

03:22:33.080 --> 03:22:34.080
Don't worry.

03:22:34.080 --> 03:22:36.080
There's not a random kid crying in your headset.

03:22:36.080 --> 03:22:37.080
It's part of the game.

03:22:39.080 --> 03:22:42.080
This is a shrunken down version

03:22:42.080 --> 03:22:44.080
of that guy that got injured.

03:22:44.080 --> 03:22:45.080
Not at this stage,

03:22:45.080 --> 03:22:46.080
but it's the same clothes and all that.

03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:48.080
And when he walks away, you can see it.

03:22:49.080 --> 03:22:51.080
Okay, so stare at him.

03:22:52.080 --> 03:22:54.080
We know you use reused assets.

03:22:54.080 --> 03:22:56.080
You be soft, we know.

03:22:57.080 --> 03:22:59.080
This is the next one.

03:23:01.080 --> 03:23:02.080
Sleepy.

03:23:04.080 --> 03:23:05.080
You are scary,

03:23:05.080 --> 03:23:07.080
but you look very brave.

03:23:11.080 --> 03:23:13.080
Right, now watch him walk away.

03:23:15.080 --> 03:23:17.080
You think you can distract me, video game?

03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:19.080
I'm on to your secrets.

03:23:21.080 --> 03:23:23.080
You might as well have me on the dev team.

03:23:23.080 --> 03:23:24.080
Look at this walk!

03:23:25.080 --> 03:23:26.080
He's injured!

03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:28.080
I can see it!

03:23:28.080 --> 03:23:29.080
You can't hide that from me.

03:23:29.080 --> 03:23:31.080
I've played this game far too many times.

03:23:31.080 --> 03:23:33.080
That's just the injured thief.

03:23:33.080 --> 03:23:35.080
Asset reused.

03:23:35.080 --> 03:23:38.080
You can't get away from me.

03:23:39.080 --> 03:23:40.080
Honestly,

03:23:40.080 --> 03:23:42.080
I wonder if there is behind the scenes development

03:23:42.080 --> 03:23:43.080
of Brotherhood,

03:23:43.080 --> 03:23:45.080
because I actually haven't consumed any of that.

03:23:45.080 --> 03:23:46.080
And if there is,

03:23:46.080 --> 03:23:49.080
I know what I'm doing the moment I go to bed.

03:23:50.080 --> 03:23:53.080
Among other things after looking at Marshmallow,

03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:55.080
hehehehehe.

03:23:56.080 --> 03:23:58.080
Okay, we do have two assassin signals,

03:23:58.080 --> 03:23:59.080
which is really good,

03:23:59.080 --> 03:24:03.080
but I should probably send the recruits away

03:24:03.080 --> 03:24:04.080
just to get stronger,

03:24:04.080 --> 03:24:05.080
but not right now,

03:24:05.080 --> 03:24:06.080
because we're in the middle of a secret.

03:24:06.080 --> 03:24:08.080
I'm just going to start upgrading stuff

03:24:08.080 --> 03:24:09.080
as I find them.

03:24:12.080 --> 03:24:13.080
Yeah.

03:24:13.080 --> 03:24:16.080
Injured thief number 312.

03:24:20.080 --> 03:24:21.080
Okay, camera angle, please.

03:24:21.080 --> 03:24:22.080
Ow!

03:24:22.080 --> 03:24:24.080
I just bumped into those guards.

03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:26.080
They literally could have reprimanded me for doing that,

03:24:26.080 --> 03:24:27.080
but I guess not.

03:24:27.080 --> 03:24:29.080
Right, we have two assassin signals,

03:24:29.080 --> 03:24:30.080
which is good.

03:24:30.080 --> 03:24:32.080
Actually, I'm going to send them a fight

03:24:32.080 --> 03:24:34.080
to get some experience,

03:24:34.080 --> 03:24:37.080
because I need to get them strong.

03:24:39.080 --> 03:24:42.080
So, we're just going to watch them do their thing.

03:24:42.080 --> 03:24:44.080
Hopefully they'll hurry up and get some XP.

03:24:46.080 --> 03:24:47.080
Yep.

03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:48.080
Take your time.

03:24:48.080 --> 03:24:49.080
There you go.

03:24:49.080 --> 03:24:51.080
They get XP every time you call them

03:24:51.080 --> 03:24:53.080
into a battle or send them in missions.

03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:54.080
It's not a problem.

03:24:54.080 --> 03:24:55.080
There we go.

03:24:55.080 --> 03:24:56.080
And they've respawned,

03:24:56.080 --> 03:24:57.080
so it's all good.

03:24:57.080 --> 03:24:59.080
We will keep another signal

03:24:59.080 --> 03:25:01.080
to do this mission, though,

03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:02.080
because to get 100%,

03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:04.080
you have to send your signal

03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:05.080
to kill the person.

03:25:05.080 --> 03:25:06.080
Again, another multiplayer character,

03:25:06.080 --> 03:25:08.080
which is why they're so designed.

03:25:12.080 --> 03:25:14.080
I can't really remember.

03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:16.080
He looks behind you

03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:18.080
on the bridge a lot,

03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:20.080
and I like to write on corners.

03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:22.080
It's quite funny, actually.

03:25:25.080 --> 03:25:27.080
You don't ever use the recruits.

03:25:27.080 --> 03:25:28.080
Are you joking?

03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:29.080
That's the best part about this game.

03:25:29.080 --> 03:25:30.080
If you suck at video gaming,

03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:32.080
you can literally just call in the recruits

03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:34.080
to do everything for you.

03:25:35.080 --> 03:25:38.080
He should start running in a second.

03:25:39.080 --> 03:25:40.080
No, around the corner he runs,

03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:42.080
because we're to go over there.

03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:49.080
He's like,

03:25:49.080 --> 03:25:51.080
yes, there's absolutely no one on this bridge

03:25:51.080 --> 03:25:53.080
that looks threatening to me whatsoever.

03:25:53.080 --> 03:25:55.080
Me just standing,

03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:57.080
not even hiding in the crowd or anything,

03:25:57.080 --> 03:25:59.080
and stops...

03:25:59.080 --> 03:26:01.080
Oh, see, he's bumping into NPCs.

03:26:01.080 --> 03:26:03.080
That's the biggest thing about tailing.

03:26:03.080 --> 03:26:04.080
If that NPC bumps them,

03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:05.080
they can turn around

03:26:05.080 --> 03:26:06.080
and look you right in the eyes,

03:26:06.080 --> 03:26:07.080
and you're like,

03:26:07.080 --> 03:26:09.080
oops, you're not really supposed to do that.

03:26:09.080 --> 03:26:11.080
He literally has a knife out,

03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:13.080
and we're gonna...

03:26:13.080 --> 03:26:14.080
I think he looks back here,

03:26:14.080 --> 03:26:16.080
and then, yeah,

03:26:16.080 --> 03:26:17.080
I remembered.

03:26:17.080 --> 03:26:18.080
He looks back here,

03:26:18.080 --> 03:26:20.080
and then he looks back as after he does a sprint

03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:22.080
on top of the stairs, okay?

03:26:22.080 --> 03:26:23.080
You're getting all the strats,

03:26:23.080 --> 03:26:24.080
so he doesn't look back anymore

03:26:24.080 --> 03:26:26.080
unless he gets bumped,

03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:28.080
which he shouldn't.

03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:29.080
No, he didn't.

03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:30.080
He didn't. That's good.

03:26:32.080 --> 03:26:35.080
And then he's about to break out in a sprint.

03:26:35.080 --> 03:26:37.080
Hey, that's right.

03:26:37.080 --> 03:26:39.080
And then you follow him,

03:26:39.080 --> 03:26:41.080
and then the game wants you to...

03:26:44.080 --> 03:26:47.080
I don't think he should have turned around at that point.

03:26:47.080 --> 03:26:48.080
No, he shouldn't have.

03:26:48.080 --> 03:26:49.080
I don't know why he did.

03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:52.080
He's not coded to turn around at that section.

03:26:52.080 --> 03:26:53.080
He's coded to turn around,

03:26:53.080 --> 03:26:55.080
like, at the top of these stairs.

03:26:56.080 --> 03:26:58.080
Unless the sequence broke.

03:27:00.080 --> 03:27:01.080
Okay, the sequence broke

03:27:01.080 --> 03:27:02.080
because he's supposed to do it

03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:03.080
at the top of those stairs.

03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:04.080
My goodness.

03:27:04.080 --> 03:27:06.080
I thought we were about to desync there.

03:27:07.080 --> 03:27:08.080
Not a game.

03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:09.080
Not a game.

03:27:09.080 --> 03:27:11.080
You gave me a heart attack.

03:27:11.080 --> 03:27:14.080
We must ensure that the kidnappings continue.

03:27:15.080 --> 03:27:17.080
No, there will be no kidnapping.

03:27:18.080 --> 03:27:19.080
Hee hee hee.

03:27:21.080 --> 03:27:23.080
Requiescati bacce.

03:27:24.080 --> 03:27:26.080
Requiescati bacce.

03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:29.080
And look at his hook arm.

03:27:29.080 --> 03:27:31.080
Yawing, using that for a design.

03:27:35.080 --> 03:27:37.080
I've got two sets of recruits.

03:27:37.080 --> 03:27:39.080
Can they hurt these guys without dying?

03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:43.080
I want them to get XP for fighting.

03:27:44.080 --> 03:27:46.080
Can they do it without Persian?

03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:49.080
I think they can, but no one leveled up.

03:27:49.080 --> 03:27:51.080
Not one person leveled up doing that.

03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:52.080
Nah, you're done.

03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:53.080
You're naughty.

03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:55.080
Users supposed to level up.

03:27:57.080 --> 03:27:59.080
Did I get into the multiplayer?

03:27:59.080 --> 03:28:01.080
No, I didn't actually.

03:28:02.080 --> 03:28:03.080
I can't quite remember.

03:28:03.080 --> 03:28:05.080
I think it was like you hide among the...

03:28:05.080 --> 03:28:06.080
Oh, someone did level up.

03:28:06.080 --> 03:28:08.080
We'll give her a weapon.

03:28:09.080 --> 03:28:11.080
Look, we've got so many assassins.

03:28:11.080 --> 03:28:14.080
I'm going to send them on...

03:28:14.080 --> 03:28:15.080
Missions.

03:28:15.080 --> 03:28:18.080
Sorry if this looks like chaotic mess on the screen right now.

03:28:18.080 --> 03:28:20.080
It's just I've done it so many times.

03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:23.080
You need to look for difficulty level 1 missions

03:28:23.080 --> 03:28:24.080
and then send the recruit on it

03:28:24.080 --> 03:28:26.080
and it will automatically make them level 2

03:28:26.080 --> 03:28:30.080
so they can at least have a bit more of a fight into them.

03:28:32.080 --> 03:28:34.080
The pigeons' eyes.

03:28:35.080 --> 03:28:37.080
They're a bit...

03:28:38.080 --> 03:28:40.080
Look, the game's from 2010.

03:28:40.080 --> 03:28:43.080
Okay, it's an older game.

03:28:43.080 --> 03:28:45.080
I'm not going to steal a horse.

03:28:45.080 --> 03:28:46.080
That's not nice.

03:28:46.080 --> 03:28:48.080
Committing Grand Horse Aul.

03:28:48.080 --> 03:28:50.080
But we'll do this.

03:28:50.080 --> 03:28:51.080
Have you played Unity?

03:28:51.080 --> 03:28:52.080
I haven't.

03:28:52.080 --> 03:28:54.080
I played Assassin's Creed,

03:28:54.080 --> 03:28:55.080
Ezio's storyline,

03:28:55.080 --> 03:28:56.080
and then I played 3

03:28:56.080 --> 03:28:59.080
and I didn't really enjoy it so much.

03:28:59.080 --> 03:29:04.080
And then I played Black Flag,

03:29:04.080 --> 03:29:07.080
but I suck at it

03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:09.080
because they changed the controls

03:29:09.080 --> 03:29:11.080
and I'm absolutely awful at it

03:29:11.080 --> 03:29:13.080
and I've never actually successfully completed it.

03:29:13.080 --> 03:29:15.080
I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.

03:29:15.080 --> 03:29:19.080
I think I'm going to go into the Tiberina Island.

03:29:22.080 --> 03:29:23.080
I'll just use that bridge there.

03:29:23.080 --> 03:29:24.080
That looks right.

03:29:27.080 --> 03:29:28.080
You enjoyed your night?

03:29:28.080 --> 03:29:29.080
I know Odyssey came out.

03:29:29.080 --> 03:29:30.080
I never played that.

03:29:30.080 --> 03:29:31.080
Like, the newer Assassin's Creed

03:29:31.080 --> 03:29:33.080
I'm absolutely not familiar with at all.

03:29:33.080 --> 03:29:34.080
I do apologize.

03:29:34.080 --> 03:29:35.080
I mean, maybe we can play it

03:29:35.080 --> 03:29:36.080
for the first time together.

03:29:40.080 --> 03:29:43.080
I think Odyssey got a really good reputation.

03:29:43.080 --> 03:29:45.080
I know there's that Japanese.

03:29:45.080 --> 03:29:46.080
Where the heck am I trying to go?

03:29:46.080 --> 03:29:48.080
Sorry, I'm getting so distracted.

03:29:48.080 --> 03:29:50.080
Talking and playing at the same time.

03:29:50.080 --> 03:29:51.080
I'm sorry.

03:29:52.080 --> 03:29:55.080
Guess who we're about to meet?

03:29:55.080 --> 03:29:56.080
Are you ready?

03:29:58.080 --> 03:29:59.080
It's you.

03:29:59.080 --> 03:30:00.080
It's you.

03:30:02.080 --> 03:30:04.080
Who are we about to meet?

03:30:15.080 --> 03:30:17.080
Leonardo da Vinci himself.

03:30:23.080 --> 03:30:24.080
Hello, Leonardo.

03:30:24.080 --> 03:30:26.080
Long time no see, buddy.

03:30:30.080 --> 03:30:33.080
So, remember when Chesery said

03:30:33.080 --> 03:30:35.080
the gun was crafted by a friend of mine?

03:30:35.080 --> 03:30:38.080
It was crafted by Leonardo.

03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:40.080
Because he's my friend.

03:30:40.080 --> 03:30:42.080
Oh, congrats if your name's Leonardo.

03:30:48.080 --> 03:30:50.080
He wanted to chop that thing off.

03:30:51.080 --> 03:30:54.080
I don't get any of the modern ACs.

03:30:54.080 --> 03:30:56.080
They don't have charm.

03:30:56.080 --> 03:30:58.080
Yeah, the apple.

03:31:00.080 --> 03:31:03.080
I gave the apple to Mario.

03:31:03.080 --> 03:31:04.080
I am sorry.

03:31:04.080 --> 03:31:05.080
Don't say that.

03:31:05.080 --> 03:31:07.080
What's 100% thing for the tank mission?

03:31:07.080 --> 03:31:09.080
You're making me scared now.

03:31:10.080 --> 03:31:13.080
What's 100% thing for the tank mission?

03:31:14.080 --> 03:31:15.080
Is it hard?

03:31:16.080 --> 03:31:18.080
I thought this game was pretty gamer friendly.

03:31:23.080 --> 03:31:24.080
You're making me now.

03:31:24.080 --> 03:31:26.080
I'm starting to break out in a sweat.

03:31:26.080 --> 03:31:27.080
We ain't even played the tank mission yet.

03:31:27.080 --> 03:31:29.080
Oh no, what is it?

03:31:30.080 --> 03:31:31.080
Stop!

03:31:31.080 --> 03:31:32.080
Stop!

03:31:32.080 --> 03:31:33.080
Is it bad?

03:31:33.080 --> 03:31:35.080
360 hours for this dream?

03:31:40.080 --> 03:31:41.080
I'm sweating.

03:31:41.080 --> 03:31:43.080
Leonardo, he's drawing, he's doing his thing.

03:31:45.080 --> 03:31:48.080
Did you know Leonardo da Vinci liked Willy?

03:31:48.080 --> 03:31:50.080
That's a true fact.

03:31:51.080 --> 03:31:54.080
You're getting educated with me.

03:31:55.080 --> 03:31:56.080
The tank mission?

03:31:56.080 --> 03:31:58.080
Oh, you're making me nervous.

03:32:00.080 --> 03:32:02.080
I'm getting scared.

03:32:04.080 --> 03:32:08.080
Is the tank mission where you have to claim all the towers and stuff?

03:32:10.080 --> 03:32:12.080
I like to get the thing.

03:32:12.080 --> 03:32:13.080
Okay, we have a long double blade.

03:32:13.080 --> 03:32:15.080
We can now do double assassinations,

03:32:15.080 --> 03:32:16.080
which is one of...

03:32:16.080 --> 03:32:19.080
That was me slapping my leg before anyone claims that it was a fart.

03:32:20.080 --> 03:32:21.080
I already know what I'm doing.

03:32:21.080 --> 03:32:23.080
Fart and don't ever...

03:32:24.080 --> 03:32:26.080
We're just unlocking new weaponry.

03:32:26.080 --> 03:32:28.080
The next thing we're going to unlock is a leap glove,

03:32:28.080 --> 03:32:35.080
which is fantastic to make jump-claiming about much easier.

03:32:39.080 --> 03:32:40.080
I just remembered the tank mission.

03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:42.080
I'm getting fucking nervous.

03:32:43.080 --> 03:32:45.080
We're making me scared for when we do it.

03:32:45.080 --> 03:32:47.080
I was going to leave the missions all to the end,

03:32:47.080 --> 03:32:48.080
so we're doing story mode,

03:32:48.080 --> 03:32:50.080
and then all the side quests stuff tomorrow,

03:32:50.080 --> 03:32:52.080
and then 100% sync.

03:32:54.080 --> 03:32:56.080
I don't know where we're heading next.

03:32:56.080 --> 03:32:57.080
Oh, okay.

03:32:57.080 --> 03:32:59.080
800 meters!

03:32:59.080 --> 03:33:01.080
That's so far away.

03:33:01.080 --> 03:33:03.080
I don't know if we can take an aqueduct.

03:33:06.080 --> 03:33:11.080
We can take an aqueduct to...

03:33:11.080 --> 03:33:13.080
Where the heck are the aqueducts?

03:33:13.080 --> 03:33:14.080
Okay, behind me.

03:33:14.080 --> 03:33:17.080
We can take an aqueduct to the mercenaries,

03:33:17.080 --> 03:33:20.080
and then we'll just have to horse on the rest.

03:33:25.080 --> 03:33:28.080
I'm getting nervous in case I can't 100% it.

03:33:28.080 --> 03:33:31.080
It's literally in the title of tomorrow's stream.

03:33:31.080 --> 03:33:32.080
I'm getting nervous.

03:33:32.080 --> 03:33:33.080
I'm getting shaky.

03:33:33.080 --> 03:33:35.080
Okay, I'm getting nervous.

03:33:37.080 --> 03:33:38.080
Where am I trying to?

03:33:38.080 --> 03:33:39.080
I'm trying to teleport.

03:33:39.080 --> 03:33:42.080
Okay, first I need to go inside the guild,

03:33:42.080 --> 03:33:47.080
and then I need to go to the mercenaries on the map,

03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:53.080
and then we're going to do the first of the Leonardo missions.

03:33:53.080 --> 03:33:54.080
Where's the heck?

03:33:54.080 --> 03:33:55.080
Where's the heck?

03:33:55.080 --> 03:33:56.080
Oh, there.

03:33:56.080 --> 03:33:57.080
I'm literally right here.

03:33:57.080 --> 03:33:58.080
Here, right here.

03:34:01.080 --> 03:34:03.080
Yes, we'll do the Leonardo...

03:34:03.080 --> 03:34:05.080
First Leonardo mission.

03:34:05.080 --> 03:34:07.080
I will do the others at the end,

03:34:07.080 --> 03:34:09.080
because I think it takes far too long to do them,

03:34:09.080 --> 03:34:10.080
in my humble opinion,

03:34:10.080 --> 03:34:12.080
although I can't remember them.

03:34:12.080 --> 03:34:14.080
The layer of Romulus are like,

03:34:14.080 --> 03:34:17.080
pretty good for climbing,

03:34:17.080 --> 03:34:19.080
for those interested in climbing.

03:34:19.080 --> 03:34:21.080
Where's my horse?

03:34:21.080 --> 03:34:22.080
My horse.

03:34:22.080 --> 03:34:23.080
Come here.

03:34:23.080 --> 03:34:25.080
You're teasing me.

03:34:25.080 --> 03:34:26.080
Okay, right.

03:34:26.080 --> 03:34:30.080
We will very quickly skedaddle over to this area.

03:34:30.080 --> 03:34:34.080
We actually still haven't unlocked the full map yet.

03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:38.080
You don't unlock the full map until sequence 7, I think.

03:34:38.080 --> 03:34:40.080
Act 7.

03:34:40.080 --> 03:34:43.080
So we might hit a boundary wall.

03:34:43.080 --> 03:34:45.080
I'm not sure if I'm going the right way.

03:34:45.080 --> 03:34:48.080
There's multiple ways you can make your way to the location,

03:34:48.080 --> 03:34:50.080
but I think I've done it right.

03:34:50.080 --> 03:34:52.080
Yes, the boundary wall right there.

03:34:52.080 --> 03:34:56.080
So we are doing it right in quotation marks.

03:34:56.080 --> 03:34:58.080
Is it up or down?

03:34:58.080 --> 03:35:01.080
Why are you sitting on the horse like that?

03:35:01.080 --> 03:35:02.080
What is it?

03:35:02.080 --> 03:35:04.080
Explain yourself.

03:35:07.080 --> 03:35:08.080
Okay, we did it.

03:35:08.080 --> 03:35:09.080
We did it.

03:35:09.080 --> 03:35:10.080
We're here.

03:35:10.080 --> 03:35:12.080
I think we just have a really basic mayor scenario,

03:35:12.080 --> 03:35:16.080
and then we will do the first Leonardo mission,

03:35:16.080 --> 03:35:17.080
which I hate,

03:35:17.080 --> 03:35:19.080
because we've actually not got the crossbow bolt,

03:35:19.080 --> 03:35:21.080
which is much easier if you have the fricking crossbow bolt,

03:35:21.080 --> 03:35:23.080
but it's fine.

03:35:23.080 --> 03:35:26.080
The mercenary should spawn in right in front of us.

03:35:26.080 --> 03:35:28.080
3, 2, 1, A.

03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:29.080
That's right.

03:35:29.080 --> 03:35:30.080
You yikers.

03:35:30.080 --> 03:35:31.080
Come with me.

03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:32.080
Come with me.

03:35:32.080 --> 03:35:34.080
You're going to beat these people up for me.

03:35:34.080 --> 03:35:35.080
Thank you.

03:35:37.080 --> 03:35:40.080
And just tell them to fight like that.

03:35:40.080 --> 03:35:42.080
And that is how you utilize the mercenary.

03:35:42.080 --> 03:35:44.080
Sorry, I'm itching my eyeball.

03:35:44.080 --> 03:35:48.080
I have a real eyelash again.

03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:50.080
And then basically, they just do all the work.

03:35:50.080 --> 03:35:52.080
I can call my assassins and...

03:35:52.080 --> 03:35:53.080
You know what?

03:35:53.080 --> 03:35:54.080
I'll do it for the XP there.

03:35:54.080 --> 03:35:55.080
Oh!

03:35:55.080 --> 03:35:57.080
I just unlocked an assassin from everything.

03:35:57.080 --> 03:35:58.080
I'll take it.

03:35:58.080 --> 03:36:00.080
No, I'm kind of through with that.

03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:03.080
Ooh.

03:36:03.080 --> 03:36:04.080
Okay, done.

03:36:08.080 --> 03:36:11.080
Okay, we now are going on a mission

03:36:11.080 --> 03:36:13.080
in a different location.

03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:15.080
Map retrieve from the overseer.

03:36:15.080 --> 03:36:17.080
I cannot read that fast,

03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:19.080
but thank you, game, for having faith in me

03:36:19.080 --> 03:36:21.080
that I can read that fast.

03:36:21.080 --> 03:36:24.080
But the truth of the matter is, I can't.

03:36:24.080 --> 03:36:25.080
Don't do that.

03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:27.080
Don't let that happen again.

03:36:27.080 --> 03:36:29.080
Have a little drink of water, game.

03:36:29.080 --> 03:36:30.080
Game, game.

03:36:30.080 --> 03:36:31.080
My voice is dying.

03:36:31.080 --> 03:36:33.080
I don't know if you can tell how messed up my voice is

03:36:33.080 --> 03:36:36.080
or if it just kind of sounds like my normal voice at this part.

03:36:39.080 --> 03:36:41.080
I'll go with the machine gun.

03:36:43.080 --> 03:36:46.080
So, this 100% is don't kill anyone.

03:36:46.080 --> 03:36:47.080
I have never done that before.

03:36:47.080 --> 03:36:49.080
I always kill people.

03:36:51.080 --> 03:36:54.080
And it's like, really, it's so much easier

03:36:54.080 --> 03:36:56.080
if you have the crossbow bolt,

03:36:56.080 --> 03:37:01.080
because, like, for goodness' sake, it...

03:37:04.080 --> 03:37:08.080
Because the crossbow bolt doesn't give your location away,

03:37:08.080 --> 03:37:12.080
but the bullets of the gun do, it's pretty bad.

03:37:12.080 --> 03:37:14.080
I'm actually not wanting to move.

03:37:14.080 --> 03:37:17.080
Yeah, that's why, because they turn around.

03:37:18.080 --> 03:37:20.080
I'm gonna yank him.

03:37:21.080 --> 03:37:24.080
I'm actually wanting to go back and kill that guy

03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:26.080
if I'm being honest.

03:37:28.080 --> 03:37:32.080
Maybe don't have to, question mark.

03:37:34.080 --> 03:37:37.080
There is a rotating guard ahead, which I don't like.

03:37:37.080 --> 03:37:38.080
Oh, he's coming!

03:37:38.080 --> 03:37:39.080
Are you joking me?

03:37:39.080 --> 03:37:40.080
I've just missed him.

03:37:40.080 --> 03:37:42.080
Oh, just missed him.

03:37:42.080 --> 03:37:45.080
We need to shoot him in order to get where we need to go.

03:37:50.080 --> 03:37:52.080
There's two bullets.

03:37:53.080 --> 03:37:56.080
Whenever there's a pigeon ledge, that means you can do a leap of faith.

03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:01.080
Your enthusiasm of the game is cute.

03:38:01.080 --> 03:38:03.080
It's just such a good game.

03:38:05.080 --> 03:38:07.080
So, as long as he doesn't turn around.

03:38:07.080 --> 03:38:10.080
If you run, it'll notify the guard of you.

03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:13.080
So, don't run when you do these kind of things.

03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:17.080
Or else the guards, the AI is basically going to be like,

03:38:17.080 --> 03:38:18.080
I have found you.

03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:21.080
And then you're like, please don't do that.

03:38:21.080 --> 03:38:22.080
I would like to be uncalled,

03:38:22.080 --> 03:38:25.080
because I don't want to redo this entire sequence all over again.

03:38:29.080 --> 03:38:33.080
Okay, this is a bit of an issue.

03:38:34.080 --> 03:38:36.080
There's a guard that rotates around the century of the wall,

03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:39.080
and that one up there, I need to shoot both of them, basically.

03:38:39.080 --> 03:38:41.080
But I need to wait until the other one rotates away.

03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:43.080
Why don't you just hypnotize the guard?

03:38:43.080 --> 03:38:45.080
For real!

03:38:45.080 --> 03:38:47.080
But they can't see me from this distance.

03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:49.080
I'm potent, I'm not that potent.

03:38:49.080 --> 03:38:51.080
Right, so we can do that, at least.

03:38:51.080 --> 03:38:54.080
And then, maybe...

03:38:54.080 --> 03:38:56.080
Wait, there's a guy there.

03:38:56.080 --> 03:38:58.080
Oh, I don't like that.

03:38:59.080 --> 03:39:02.080
Uh...

03:39:06.080 --> 03:39:10.080
Sorry, this part, you can fuck up so easily.

03:39:10.080 --> 03:39:13.080
Okay, we didn't fuck up.

03:39:13.080 --> 03:39:15.080
Burn it, and then we get this checkpoint.

03:39:15.080 --> 03:39:17.080
Okay.

03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:19.080
Ta-da!

03:39:19.080 --> 03:39:21.080
We have achieved the checkpoint, we no longer have to sneak around.

03:39:21.080 --> 03:39:23.080
We can just do our thing.

03:39:23.080 --> 03:39:25.080
Pew!

03:39:25.080 --> 03:39:27.080
I don't ever want to do that again.

03:39:27.080 --> 03:39:30.080
She says, as she has to do it again.

03:39:30.080 --> 03:39:34.080
You can just drop down, doesn't cause any damage to you.

03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:39.080
But the music creators for the speed-up song,

03:39:39.080 --> 03:39:43.080
like that is so terrifying.

03:39:43.080 --> 03:39:45.080
It strikes blood into the hearts.

03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:48.080
It strikes fear into the hearts, not blood into the hearts.

03:39:48.080 --> 03:39:52.080
I mean, that's what hearts do, they pump blood around and stuff.

03:39:53.080 --> 03:39:56.080
Get all oxygenated again.

03:39:56.080 --> 03:39:59.080
Okay, this is the part I freaking hate.

03:39:59.080 --> 03:40:02.080
Because I don't know how to, like, not get it to lock on.

03:40:02.080 --> 03:40:05.080
You can literally go side to side and evade.

03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:08.080
And you will still get... Why are there people there?

03:40:08.080 --> 03:40:12.080
Like, I'm evading, but I'm probably going to get hit.

03:40:12.080 --> 03:40:15.080
I don't know how to not get hit.

03:40:15.080 --> 03:40:18.080
I played this so many times.

03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:21.080
Although I did evade all of those,

03:40:21.080 --> 03:40:25.080
so maybe my swirling is doing much better.

03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:29.080
Evasive maneuvers, evasive maneuvers!

03:40:29.080 --> 03:40:31.080
Ah, see, I don't get it!

03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:33.080
I'm literally going side to side.

03:40:33.080 --> 03:40:35.080
I wonder if it's a distance thing as well.

03:40:35.080 --> 03:40:37.080
Like, if I get too close, the game's like,

03:40:37.080 --> 03:40:39.080
you're not allowed to get that close,

03:40:39.080 --> 03:40:42.080
and it's like, oh, sorry, you didn't really explain.

03:40:42.080 --> 03:40:45.080
Like, pardon my French,

03:40:45.080 --> 03:40:49.080
but je n'ai c'est quoi, on what's going on me.

03:40:51.080 --> 03:40:53.080
Okay, let's go. Next sequence.

03:40:53.080 --> 03:40:55.080
This is actually pretty badass.

03:40:55.080 --> 03:40:58.080
I can't seem to have to admit.

03:41:06.080 --> 03:41:08.080
Stabbed-in throw SFX.

03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:12.080
We will use the tactical camera,

03:41:12.080 --> 03:41:15.080
because it's literally, like, if you're down here,

03:41:15.080 --> 03:41:17.080
it's like so close.

03:41:17.080 --> 03:41:21.080
And you can use the map to see who's coming up,

03:41:21.080 --> 03:41:23.080
so I can see there's one on the right,

03:41:23.080 --> 03:41:25.080
and then we're going to swing back left,

03:41:25.080 --> 03:41:27.080
and then we're going to swing back right.

03:41:27.080 --> 03:41:30.080
You don't need to worry about the archers at all

03:41:30.080 --> 03:41:32.080
in this part of the mission.

03:41:32.080 --> 03:41:34.080
They don't hurt you.

03:41:34.080 --> 03:41:36.080
I've never been hurt,

03:41:36.080 --> 03:41:39.080
but you can see left side again on the red dot map,

03:41:39.080 --> 03:41:41.080
which I'm covering up! Lovely!

03:41:41.080 --> 03:41:45.080
I just realised I'm covering up the entirety of the map,

03:41:45.080 --> 03:41:48.080
so you can't see any of that that I've just been commentating on.

03:41:48.080 --> 03:41:50.080
I do apologise.

03:41:53.080 --> 03:41:55.080
Again, the horses always get up.

03:41:55.080 --> 03:41:57.080
Please don't worry. The horsey-worsies are fine.

03:41:57.080 --> 03:42:02.080
You can pre-fire when the red markers spawn in.

03:42:02.080 --> 03:42:04.080
You can get to it.

03:42:04.080 --> 03:42:07.080
And you can, like, hit them before the markers actually show up,

03:42:07.080 --> 03:42:09.080
because that's really loud.

03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:11.080
Hopefully that's not too loud for you guys.

03:42:15.080 --> 03:42:17.080
The horses are fine. Please don't worry.

03:42:17.080 --> 03:42:19.080
All horses get back up in the game.

03:42:23.080 --> 03:42:26.080
If they aim a bit too close, they're going to get me.

03:42:29.080 --> 03:42:31.080
Am I going to get away with that?

03:42:33.080 --> 03:42:35.080
Shoot them down!

03:42:35.080 --> 03:42:37.080
That wasn't bad either.

03:42:37.080 --> 03:42:39.080
Oh, back up on the horse!

03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:42.080
You better stop!

03:42:47.080 --> 03:42:49.080
This is, like, Snape or Simulator, honestly.

03:42:49.080 --> 03:42:50.080
Oops!

03:42:50.080 --> 03:42:53.080
Oh no, I'm going to get shot. I messed up.

03:42:55.080 --> 03:42:57.080
Hello?

03:42:57.080 --> 03:42:59.080
They're out the road!

03:43:05.080 --> 03:43:07.080
I actually wanted to perish there.

03:43:07.080 --> 03:43:09.080
He said I like feeling pain.

03:43:11.080 --> 03:43:13.080
Sorry, I'm, like, really focusing.

03:43:13.080 --> 03:43:15.080
I don't have the best aim on analogue.

03:43:15.080 --> 03:43:17.080
So, I'll try it.

03:43:18.080 --> 03:43:21.080
But yeah, this is the first mission.

03:43:21.080 --> 03:43:23.080
It's the easiest out of them all.

03:43:23.080 --> 03:43:25.080
This is still tutorial section stuff,

03:43:25.080 --> 03:43:27.080
because the Leonardo missions are main game.

03:43:27.080 --> 03:43:31.080
So, this is technical tutorial.

03:43:31.080 --> 03:43:33.080
We still go in there.

03:43:37.080 --> 03:43:39.080
I'm trying to remember the axe.

03:43:39.080 --> 03:43:43.080
Maybe axe, which is the order.

03:43:48.080 --> 03:43:50.080
Oh, can I hit the barrel?

03:43:50.080 --> 03:43:52.080
Yeah, I can hit the barrel.

03:43:53.080 --> 03:43:55.080
How many are there?

03:43:55.080 --> 03:43:57.080
Okay, we've almost done the sequence,

03:43:57.080 --> 03:43:59.080
and then we're back into the main game.

03:44:00.080 --> 03:44:03.080
I might get another Kola, actually.

03:44:06.080 --> 03:44:08.080
My voice is feeling it.

03:44:10.080 --> 03:44:15.080
I don't know how to extend the stamina of my voice.

03:44:15.080 --> 03:44:17.080
I'm not really sure.

03:44:17.080 --> 03:44:20.080
Other than, like, be quiet five heads.

03:44:20.080 --> 03:44:23.080
But, like, I want to stream.

03:44:23.080 --> 03:44:24.080
I want to have a good time.

03:44:24.080 --> 03:44:26.080
Like, I have so much lost time to make up for.

03:44:26.080 --> 03:44:28.080
Like, you have no idea.

03:44:29.080 --> 03:44:32.080
I saw you spawn in. I saw that.

03:44:34.080 --> 03:44:36.080
I saw you spawn in.

03:44:38.080 --> 03:44:40.080
Hydration and practice.

03:44:40.080 --> 03:44:43.080
I've been using my voice for years now.

03:44:44.080 --> 03:44:46.080
Just speak smaller words.

03:44:46.080 --> 03:44:48.080
Okay.

03:44:48.080 --> 03:44:50.080
Work is a call center agent.

03:44:50.080 --> 03:44:52.080
Water helps.

03:44:55.080 --> 03:44:57.080
Oh, actually.

03:44:57.080 --> 03:44:59.080
Hopefully none of the girls are in here.

03:44:59.080 --> 03:45:01.080
I want to do a short with them.

03:45:01.080 --> 03:45:05.080
Apparently, girls can't make good weapon sounds.

03:45:05.080 --> 03:45:07.080
Like, I'll make the sound of a gun.

03:45:07.080 --> 03:45:11.080
So I'm going to ask all the girls to record an audio of them making sound of a gun.

03:45:11.080 --> 03:45:13.080
And then I'm going to put it in a short.

03:45:13.080 --> 03:45:15.080
It's just like a goofy, funny-ha-ha thing.

03:45:15.080 --> 03:45:17.080
It's nothing serious.

03:45:17.080 --> 03:45:22.080
I'm going to take a few yards from the location of where I'm supposed to go.

03:45:22.080 --> 03:45:24.080
Are you kidding me?

03:45:24.080 --> 03:45:28.080
So I was going to do a shotgun and see if they come up with, like, pistols.

03:45:28.080 --> 03:45:30.080
Or maybe an AK.

03:45:30.080 --> 03:45:32.080
We've got quite a few levels up.

03:45:32.080 --> 03:45:34.080
We've got level three, which is fantastic.

03:45:34.080 --> 03:45:38.080
We're starting to get a bit more serious with the recruits.

03:45:38.080 --> 03:45:41.080
They're starting to get a bit more, like, they can survive.

03:45:41.080 --> 03:45:45.080
I'm actually going to send them on a bigger mission.

03:45:46.080 --> 03:45:50.080
I'm going to take the level three to go level up someone.

03:45:50.080 --> 03:45:52.080
Can I send them on level twos?

03:45:52.080 --> 03:45:55.080
I'll send them on level twos. It's very unlikely they're going to fail.

03:45:55.080 --> 03:45:58.080
But the level two missions are quite long.

03:46:01.080 --> 03:46:03.080
Wonder who's going to be the best.

03:46:03.080 --> 03:46:08.080
I'm going with the classic shotgun, like, the ch-ch-ch-loser there.

03:46:08.080 --> 03:46:11.080
But I'll be very interested to see what the girls come up with.

03:46:11.080 --> 03:46:13.080
I'm trying to go brrrrr.

03:46:17.080 --> 03:46:27.080
Wow, okay, I guess I will go back to the mercenaries to use the aqueduct there.

03:46:27.080 --> 03:46:29.080
Oh, there's an aqueduct there as well.

03:46:29.080 --> 03:46:31.080
Is that closer? I think so.

03:46:32.080 --> 03:46:35.080
You can roll your R's if you're Scottish.

03:46:36.080 --> 03:46:41.080
I know some languages, like, don't roll their R's.

03:46:44.080 --> 03:46:47.080
I was going to say something and my brain completely blanked.

03:46:47.080 --> 03:46:49.080
I'm now going to pretend otherwise.

03:46:50.080 --> 03:46:53.080
Oh, I'm out of bounds. Hard and moir.

03:46:54.080 --> 03:46:56.080
Can I still get to this aqueduct?

03:46:56.080 --> 03:46:58.080
Not aqueduct, the...

03:46:58.080 --> 03:47:00.080
It's not cistern. What is it?

03:47:00.080 --> 03:47:02.080
Is it a cistern? Cistern access?

03:47:05.080 --> 03:47:09.080
Oh my god, new name for Niji fans just dropped cisterns.

03:47:09.080 --> 03:47:13.080
That's awful. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that out loud.

03:47:13.080 --> 03:47:15.080
That's the dumbest thing I've said all day.

03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:21.080
My views do not reflect that, Alveolar.

03:47:21.080 --> 03:47:23.080
My views are my own. I do not reflect the company.

03:47:23.080 --> 03:47:26.080
Thank you. I'm just playing Assassin's Creed, please, the middle.

03:47:29.080 --> 03:47:31.080
What does your 11 kill streak sound like?

03:47:32.080 --> 03:47:36.080
I don't know how to make sounds of knives or weaponry.

03:47:43.080 --> 03:47:45.080
Watch whoever you enjoy.

03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:52.080
Someone sent me a marshmallow and it was a link to someone from an agency.

03:47:52.080 --> 03:47:54.080
I'm not going to name the agency.

03:47:54.080 --> 03:47:56.080
They were like, please save her.

03:47:56.080 --> 03:47:58.080
And I was like...

03:47:59.080 --> 03:48:01.080
What do you want me to do?

03:48:01.080 --> 03:48:04.080
They're locked into a contract.

03:48:05.080 --> 03:48:08.080
We have a non-compete at VLR.

03:48:08.080 --> 03:48:13.080
You can literally jump straight into a VTuber agency once your time's up here, if you're finished.

03:48:13.080 --> 03:48:16.080
But what do you want me to do?

03:48:16.080 --> 03:48:21.080
Seriously, you want me to message the company and be like, hey, can I buy her out?

03:48:22.080 --> 03:48:26.080
Thank you for your faith in me, but what am I supposed to do?

03:48:30.080 --> 03:48:33.080
I mean, sure, I would if I could, but...

03:48:34.080 --> 03:48:38.080
I want everyone to be happy and having a good time while they're streaming, but...

03:48:38.080 --> 03:48:40.080
I can't help everyone.

03:48:42.080 --> 03:48:44.080
Set them free?

03:48:45.080 --> 03:48:48.080
No, that sounds so bad, because it's like...

03:48:48.080 --> 03:48:51.080
It sounds like buying like...

03:48:57.080 --> 03:48:59.080
Hederation check.

03:49:02.080 --> 03:49:04.080
I'm going to do a burp.

03:49:05.080 --> 03:49:08.080
Buy the company, my goodness.

03:49:08.080 --> 03:49:10.080
No chance.

03:49:10.080 --> 03:49:12.080
VTuber Moses?

03:49:13.080 --> 03:49:17.080
That is the funniest thing I think I've been called in a long time.

03:49:17.080 --> 03:49:20.080
VTuber Moses, set them free.

03:49:23.080 --> 03:49:26.080
That's hilarious.

03:49:30.080 --> 03:49:32.080
Hijack the company.

03:49:35.080 --> 03:49:38.080
Let companies cook. You'll see eventually.

03:49:41.080 --> 03:49:43.080
Let my people go.

03:49:47.080 --> 03:49:50.080
Once Cesare arrives, you will never get to him.

03:49:50.080 --> 03:49:53.080
I intend to kill the French general.

03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:56.080
Okay, we're getting assigned our next act.

03:49:56.080 --> 03:49:58.080
The Frenchies.

03:49:59.080 --> 03:50:02.080
Desolé if you're a French fry.

03:50:02.080 --> 03:50:05.080
It's not in personal, mate. Not in personal.

03:50:05.080 --> 03:50:08.080
You know, viva la France and all that.

03:50:08.080 --> 03:50:12.080
And c'est la vie, and what other words do you say in French?

03:50:12.080 --> 03:50:15.080
I will have my thieves as I retain his location.

03:50:22.080 --> 03:50:26.080
I have no recruits to send on a mission, because I've already sent them on the mission.

03:50:31.080 --> 03:50:33.080
Where are you going?

03:50:33.080 --> 03:50:35.080
I am not used to anyone without follow-up.

03:50:38.080 --> 03:50:41.080
I am Swiss, I totally support any French propaganda.

03:50:42.080 --> 03:50:44.080
That's awful.

03:50:51.080 --> 03:50:53.080
Oh, I said it wrong.

03:50:58.080 --> 03:51:00.080
Oh no!

03:51:00.080 --> 03:51:03.080
Oh no, I think I'm going to have to go back to scuff tracking.

03:51:03.080 --> 03:51:06.080
My iPhone is at 20%.

03:51:06.080 --> 03:51:09.080
Scuff tracking, here we go.

03:51:09.080 --> 03:51:13.080
Unless I can get it to balance with the charger in...

03:51:13.080 --> 03:51:16.080
Oh my god, you're hearing everything connect.

03:51:16.080 --> 03:51:19.080
Okay, can I get it to balance?

03:51:22.080 --> 03:51:24.080
We're getting a bit horizontal.

03:51:24.080 --> 03:51:26.080
Right, this is dangerous.

03:51:26.080 --> 03:51:28.080
I'm going to put you in front of my glass.

03:51:28.080 --> 03:51:32.080
And I'm going to wedge you in between my keyboard.

03:51:32.080 --> 03:51:34.080
Okay, this isn't working.

03:51:34.080 --> 03:51:37.080
I'm going to wedge you in between...

03:51:37.080 --> 03:51:39.080
My tea cup.

03:51:39.080 --> 03:51:41.080
Let me just...

03:51:41.080 --> 03:51:43.080
Oh, pardon me.

03:51:45.080 --> 03:51:46.080
Okay.

03:51:46.080 --> 03:51:47.080
Uh-huh.

03:51:47.080 --> 03:51:48.080
Oh yeah?

03:51:48.080 --> 03:51:50.080
Okay, yeah?

03:51:50.080 --> 03:51:52.080
Are you still tracking?

03:51:56.080 --> 03:51:57.080
Hello?

03:51:57.080 --> 03:51:58.080
Yes!

03:51:59.080 --> 03:52:00.080
I get it.

03:52:00.080 --> 03:52:01.080
Okay, what actor are we on?

03:52:01.080 --> 03:52:04.080
The banker or the French one?

03:52:04.080 --> 03:52:06.080
I think we're in the French one.

03:52:06.080 --> 03:52:07.080
What broke?

03:52:07.080 --> 03:52:08.080
I didn't break anything.

03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:10.080
If I ain't broke, don't fix it.

03:52:10.080 --> 03:52:12.080
Right, we're going to see how much...

03:52:14.080 --> 03:52:18.080
We're going to see how much it costs to buy the crossbow.

03:52:18.080 --> 03:52:20.080
$12,800.

03:52:20.080 --> 03:52:22.080
I don't have that.

03:52:24.080 --> 03:52:26.080
I'll look away for a second.

03:52:26.080 --> 03:52:29.080
I'm going to be wedged in between a body part.

03:52:29.080 --> 03:52:31.080
How dare you insinuate?

03:52:31.080 --> 03:52:33.080
Right, what mission are we doing?

03:52:34.080 --> 03:52:36.080
Memory Star up here?

03:52:38.080 --> 03:52:42.080
Is it the banker that we're on?

03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:44.080
I kind of think we may be on the banker mission,

03:52:44.080 --> 03:52:46.080
but I can't really remember.

03:52:46.080 --> 03:52:48.080
And my wife had a baby?

03:52:50.080 --> 03:52:51.080
It's Tony Tern Golem.

03:52:51.080 --> 03:52:52.080
I want to try and do that,

03:52:52.080 --> 03:52:55.080
but I think I would destroy my voice in like 20 minutes.

03:52:55.080 --> 03:52:57.080
We hate it.

03:53:00.080 --> 03:53:02.080
It's ink in the back of my throat.

03:53:02.080 --> 03:53:04.080
It's your ink in the back of my throat.

03:53:07.080 --> 03:53:08.080
We're going to rebuild.

03:53:08.080 --> 03:53:10.080
We built this city.

03:53:11.080 --> 03:53:15.080
We built this city on Florence.

03:53:15.080 --> 03:53:20.080
Because that is the currency.

03:53:24.080 --> 03:53:26.080
Actually, I need to do that audio.

03:53:26.080 --> 03:53:27.080
Keep forgetting.

03:53:27.080 --> 03:53:28.080
Post it.

03:53:28.080 --> 03:53:29.080
I need to make it.

03:53:29.080 --> 03:53:32.080
I think I can probably do it after this stream.

03:53:34.080 --> 03:53:36.080
It's a free audio.

03:53:36.080 --> 03:53:37.080
It's just on the ult.

03:53:41.080 --> 03:53:43.080
I'm golem posing whilst gaming.

03:53:43.080 --> 03:53:46.080
I mean, if you want to get technical.

03:53:47.080 --> 03:53:49.080
Should that be a donors on reward?

03:53:49.080 --> 03:53:50.080
It's just a picture.

03:53:50.080 --> 03:53:53.080
Obviously I'd edit my face out and all that.

03:53:53.080 --> 03:53:56.080
It's just a picture of me like bucking a snake.

03:53:56.080 --> 03:54:01.080
Because that's a normally game on my chair in the golem pose.

03:54:01.080 --> 03:54:04.080
And everyone's like, what is this?

03:54:04.080 --> 03:54:07.080
And I was like, it just means what I'm doing.

03:54:09.080 --> 03:54:11.080
Something the adventurer is.

03:54:14.080 --> 03:54:16.080
They're like, what is this pale creature?

03:54:16.080 --> 03:54:18.080
Oh wait, it clearly is golem.

03:54:18.080 --> 03:54:20.080
No questions asked.

03:54:26.080 --> 03:54:27.080
Oh my, yes please.

03:54:27.080 --> 03:54:35.080
Excuse me, I'm on the mission.

03:54:38.080 --> 03:54:41.080
M.E.'s eyes are currently rolling out of her skull right now.

03:54:43.080 --> 03:54:44.080
How much?

03:54:49.080 --> 03:54:51.080
Oh, I forgot to put what she was saying.

03:54:52.080 --> 03:54:55.080
Yeah, I decided on...

03:54:55.080 --> 03:54:59.080
Strongly clips and strongly...

03:54:59.080 --> 03:55:02.080
R just to be strong R and strong clips.

03:55:02.080 --> 03:55:04.080
Because I couldn't think of anything else.

03:55:04.080 --> 03:55:08.080
Although someone sent a really good suggestion on Marshmallow.

03:55:08.080 --> 03:55:09.080
I might change it.

03:55:09.080 --> 03:55:11.080
I mean, we're super early days.

03:55:11.080 --> 03:55:12.080
Like, I can literally change it.

03:55:12.080 --> 03:55:13.080
I have something else.

03:55:14.080 --> 03:55:15.080
Hey hey, Pipi!

03:55:15.080 --> 03:55:17.080
Excuse me, I'm on a mission.

03:55:17.080 --> 03:55:18.080
Where?

03:55:18.080 --> 03:55:19.080
A mission?

03:55:20.080 --> 03:55:21.080
Oh Lolo?

03:55:22.080 --> 03:55:23.080
Okay, this is the banker.

03:55:24.080 --> 03:55:25.080
This is the banker act.

03:55:29.080 --> 03:55:30.080
Sorry.

03:55:33.080 --> 03:55:35.080
I can't sing and do the golem voice.

03:55:35.080 --> 03:55:36.080
My only wish?

03:55:37.080 --> 03:55:40.080
I sound like Marsh from Homey.

03:55:42.080 --> 03:55:44.080
Oh, I can't sing in the golem voice.

03:55:44.080 --> 03:55:49.080
My only wish to catch a fish so juicy and sweet.

03:55:54.080 --> 03:55:55.080
Homey!

03:55:58.080 --> 03:55:59.080
That's terrible.

03:55:59.080 --> 03:56:01.080
That's awful.

03:56:02.080 --> 03:56:04.080
I think Emi is Kubeko.

03:56:04.080 --> 03:56:09.080
She is, how you say, a tabernac.

03:56:11.080 --> 03:56:13.080
And, yeah.

03:56:14.080 --> 03:56:15.080
She doesn't count.

03:56:16.080 --> 03:56:17.080
She doesn't count as a true Frenchie.

03:56:18.080 --> 03:56:19.080
A true French fry.

03:56:20.080 --> 03:56:22.080
French fries are European Frenchies.

03:56:22.080 --> 03:56:23.080
The Swiss are the Swiss.

03:56:24.080 --> 03:56:25.080
And the Kubekois.

03:56:25.080 --> 03:56:26.080
The Kubek.

03:56:26.080 --> 03:56:27.080
Kubek.

03:56:28.080 --> 03:56:29.080
Kubek.

03:56:32.080 --> 03:56:34.080
Homey is the silo stuff.

03:56:37.080 --> 03:56:41.080
Honestly, her Kubekois is something I've heard before.

03:56:42.080 --> 03:56:44.080
She says she's not very confident.

03:56:44.080 --> 03:56:46.080
But as long as she can form sentences,

03:56:46.080 --> 03:56:47.080
the best I can say is like,

03:56:47.080 --> 03:56:53.080
Je vais, je vais, tu vas, il va, elle va.

03:56:53.080 --> 03:56:56.080
Nous allons, nous allons, il va et elle va.

03:56:56.080 --> 03:56:58.080
I can say, I would like, je voudrais,

03:56:58.080 --> 03:57:03.080
I can say, I, which is, j'arrive.

03:57:04.080 --> 03:57:10.080
I can say, I don't think I know any more

03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:13.080
doing words in French, any more verbs.

03:57:17.080 --> 03:57:19.080
All the French fries are like,

03:57:20.080 --> 03:57:21.080
Okay, here we go.

03:57:22.080 --> 03:57:23.080
I'm back.

03:57:23.080 --> 03:57:24.080
What did I miss?

03:57:24.080 --> 03:57:26.080
We're memeing on the French, like everyone else.

03:57:27.080 --> 03:57:30.080
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

03:57:31.080 --> 03:57:32.080
Oh my God, my voice cracked.

03:57:32.080 --> 03:57:33.080
Did you hear that?

03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:36.080
Took years of French.

03:57:36.080 --> 03:57:38.080
I think I can say the colors in French.

03:57:39.080 --> 03:57:42.080
Rouge, rose,

03:57:42.080 --> 03:57:46.080
orange,

03:57:48.080 --> 03:57:49.080
green,

03:57:51.080 --> 03:57:53.080
jolie,

03:57:54.080 --> 03:57:57.080
noir, blanc,

03:57:59.080 --> 03:58:00.080
marron,

03:58:02.080 --> 03:58:03.080
what a French.

03:58:03.080 --> 03:58:05.080
Do you money too, do I?

03:58:05.080 --> 03:58:07.080
I'm looking for chésarés bankers.

03:58:07.080 --> 03:58:08.080
Palais-vous francais?

03:58:08.080 --> 03:58:10.080
Oui, oui, avec les poissons,

03:58:10.080 --> 03:58:12.080
dans les sacs.

03:58:12.080 --> 03:58:14.080
Ouais, what did you just make me say?

03:58:14.080 --> 03:58:16.080
I can like kind of half read French.

03:58:16.080 --> 03:58:17.080
I have no idea what I'm saying,

03:58:17.080 --> 03:58:19.080
but I can kind of read it,

03:58:19.080 --> 03:58:21.080
like with the letters and stuff.

03:58:23.080 --> 03:58:24.080
The French aren't real,

03:58:24.080 --> 03:58:26.080
it's a lie made up by the English.

03:58:28.080 --> 03:58:30.080
Je suis monté, pardon.

03:58:31.080 --> 03:58:32.080
All right, this way.

03:58:36.080 --> 03:58:38.080
You're going to have to protect me, though.

03:58:38.080 --> 03:58:40.080
The guards aren't being very friendly.

03:58:40.080 --> 03:58:41.080
You're going to have to protect me.

03:58:43.080 --> 03:58:44.080
Hello, gentlemen.

03:58:44.080 --> 03:58:46.080
May I please double assassinate you?

03:58:46.080 --> 03:58:48.080
No, double assassinate.

03:58:48.080 --> 03:58:50.080
Oh, don't be detected!

03:58:50.080 --> 03:58:52.080
Don't be detected with the mission,

03:58:52.080 --> 03:58:54.080
and the first thing I do is go up

03:58:54.080 --> 03:58:56.080
and kill some guys.

03:58:56.080 --> 03:58:58.080
I'm not very smart, am I?

03:58:59.080 --> 03:59:00.080
Oh well.

03:59:03.080 --> 03:59:05.080
A little oversight, but...

03:59:06.080 --> 03:59:08.080
It's fine.

03:59:08.080 --> 03:59:10.080
Morning!

03:59:12.080 --> 03:59:14.080
Good morning!

03:59:15.080 --> 03:59:17.080
Good evening!

03:59:17.080 --> 03:59:20.080
I really don't want to send my assassins

03:59:20.080 --> 03:59:22.080
on, like, the Lancers,

03:59:22.080 --> 03:59:24.080
but as long as they kill the right guy first,

03:59:24.080 --> 03:59:26.080
it should be fine.

03:59:28.080 --> 03:59:30.080
Right, sorry, the senator's currently complaining

03:59:30.080 --> 03:59:32.080
about his money issues

03:59:32.080 --> 03:59:34.080
and how he hates the Vorgia.

03:59:34.080 --> 03:59:36.080
I'm talking right over it.

03:59:38.080 --> 03:59:39.080
Oops!

03:59:39.080 --> 03:59:41.080
Well, thank goodness they called,

03:59:41.080 --> 03:59:43.080
came in and in.

03:59:50.080 --> 03:59:51.080
Uh, hello?

03:59:51.080 --> 03:59:52.080
Whoa!

03:59:52.080 --> 03:59:53.080
Yeah, see this?

03:59:53.080 --> 03:59:55.080
The citizens become assassins,

03:59:55.080 --> 03:59:56.080
they get scared.

03:59:56.080 --> 03:59:58.080
Why do you not do double blade?

03:59:58.080 --> 04:00:00.080
I have a double blade.

04:00:00.080 --> 04:00:01.080
I'm pretty sure there's, like,

04:00:01.080 --> 04:00:03.080
stuff to do double blade stuff as well.

04:00:04.080 --> 04:00:06.080
Uh, really appreciate it.

04:00:06.080 --> 04:00:08.080
A few different skills to do here.

04:00:09.080 --> 04:00:12.080
We should probably get rid of some of our noray.

04:00:13.080 --> 04:00:15.080
This is where we start now.

04:00:15.080 --> 04:00:16.080
We're doing 100% tomorrow.

04:00:16.080 --> 04:00:18.080
We're just doing campaign mode right now.

04:00:21.080 --> 04:00:23.080
Wouldn't be good time zone be easier.

04:00:23.080 --> 04:00:24.080
Aha!

04:00:24.080 --> 04:00:26.080
Good time zone, everyone!

04:00:28.080 --> 04:00:30.080
That's awful.

04:00:35.080 --> 04:00:38.080
Uh, we may be able to get a gun.

04:00:38.080 --> 04:00:39.080
Yes!

04:00:39.080 --> 04:00:41.080
No!

04:00:41.080 --> 04:00:44.080
I was gonna sneak by them.

04:00:45.080 --> 04:00:46.080
I like how he's continuing to talk

04:00:46.080 --> 04:00:48.080
whilst being beaten up by a sword.

04:00:50.080 --> 04:00:52.080
Are they not attacking him?

04:00:54.080 --> 04:00:57.080
Assassin recruits, are you so for real right now?

04:00:57.080 --> 04:00:59.080
Can you attack him?

04:00:59.080 --> 04:01:00.080
What's going on?

04:01:00.080 --> 04:01:01.080
Oh my god.

04:01:01.080 --> 04:01:03.080
Oh, they've attracted more it guards.

04:01:07.080 --> 04:01:08.080
What?

04:01:08.080 --> 04:01:10.080
And now someone's grabbing the guard?

04:01:10.080 --> 04:01:11.080
Hello?

04:01:11.080 --> 04:01:12.080
Right, no.

04:01:12.080 --> 04:01:13.080
This isn't my problem.

04:01:13.080 --> 04:01:14.080
Sorry.

04:01:15.080 --> 04:01:18.080
I don't know what is going on over there, but...

04:01:20.080 --> 04:01:23.080
Uh, I don't think they will attack us.

04:01:24.080 --> 04:01:26.080
We're so far away.

04:01:26.080 --> 04:01:28.080
Okay, so the assassins are dealing with them.

04:01:28.080 --> 04:01:30.080
That was, I think the AI was like,

04:01:30.080 --> 04:01:32.080
no idea who to target first,

04:01:32.080 --> 04:01:34.080
so it was just going for like everyone.

04:01:38.080 --> 04:01:40.080
As a Spanish speaker, it should not be that bad.

04:01:40.080 --> 04:01:42.080
I can understand quite a lot of Spanish.

04:01:48.080 --> 04:01:50.080
That's the best I got for Spanish.

04:01:50.080 --> 04:01:52.080
Sorry, but man's not got any Spanish.

04:01:55.080 --> 04:01:57.080
I'm trying to think about this one.

04:02:00.080 --> 04:02:01.080
Puta matvee!

04:02:01.080 --> 04:02:02.080
Oh wait, no, I did wrong.

04:02:02.080 --> 04:02:04.080
Puta matvee!

04:02:06.080 --> 04:02:08.080
That's my Espanol.

04:02:10.080 --> 04:02:11.080
We're going...

04:02:12.080 --> 04:02:14.080
Guards, guards, guards.

04:02:18.080 --> 04:02:19.080
No, a horse.

04:02:19.080 --> 04:02:20.080
Anything but a horse.

04:02:21.080 --> 04:02:23.080
I'm sorry, but you're getting targeted first.

04:02:23.080 --> 04:02:25.080
I don't want any horse problems.

04:02:27.080 --> 04:02:28.080
Oh, the senator's under attack?

04:02:28.080 --> 04:02:30.080
No, they should be attacking me.

04:02:31.080 --> 04:02:32.080
How much health has he got?

04:02:32.080 --> 04:02:35.080
Oh no, he's still like not even lost the square health.

04:02:35.080 --> 04:02:37.080
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

04:02:37.080 --> 04:02:39.080
Assassins help now.

04:02:40.080 --> 04:02:42.080
Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good.

04:02:42.080 --> 04:02:43.080
And someone got promoted.

04:02:44.080 --> 04:02:46.080
Smells like promotion, boys.

04:02:48.080 --> 04:02:49.080
Can I...

04:02:49.080 --> 04:02:51.080
I don't think I can sneak past these guys, so...

04:02:51.080 --> 04:02:53.080
We're just going to go for it, we're just going to send it.

04:02:54.080 --> 04:02:57.080
My assassin recruits just take too long to come back and...

04:02:58.080 --> 04:02:59.080
I'm dumb, so...

04:03:04.080 --> 04:03:06.080
Time to get some sleep, please rest well.

04:03:07.080 --> 04:03:09.080
Sleep well, sweet dreams.

04:03:11.080 --> 04:03:12.080
Do you know other Italian words?

04:03:13.080 --> 04:03:14.080
No.

04:03:14.080 --> 04:03:17.080
Only like Spingy for push, Ayuto for help.

04:03:18.080 --> 04:03:20.080
Katsuo, to swear.

04:03:22.080 --> 04:03:24.080
It's Emmy at piano.

04:03:27.080 --> 04:03:29.080
Aw, it's Emmy at piano?

04:03:29.080 --> 04:03:31.080
She tickled on them ivories.

04:03:31.080 --> 04:03:33.080
Thank goodness I have ivory skin,

04:03:33.080 --> 04:03:35.080
because my goodness, I'm in for a good time.

04:03:38.080 --> 04:03:40.080
They're attacking me, anyways.

04:03:43.080 --> 04:03:47.080
I've not played this game, I've played the game in Dutch once.

04:03:47.080 --> 04:03:50.080
Just so to say follow me in Dutch, you say volg, mate.

04:03:53.080 --> 04:03:55.080
But, yeah, not really.

04:03:55.080 --> 04:03:57.080
It's just subtitles and stuff.

04:04:00.080 --> 04:04:01.080
I knew it.

04:04:07.080 --> 04:04:08.080
Why in Dutch?

04:04:08.080 --> 04:04:11.080
I wanted to learn Dutch at one point, but I gave up.

04:04:13.080 --> 04:04:15.080
I only know Scots in English.

04:04:18.080 --> 04:04:19.080
Family.

04:04:23.080 --> 04:04:26.080
Yeah, Dutch is one of the easiest languages to learn.

04:04:26.080 --> 04:04:28.080
If you're English speaking,

04:04:28.080 --> 04:04:33.080
it only takes apparently like 40 hours to like get the basics to...

04:04:33.080 --> 04:04:35.080
in all that jazz, so...

04:04:36.080 --> 04:04:39.080
20 Florence, that was it.

04:04:39.080 --> 04:04:41.080
In that chest.

04:04:42.080 --> 04:04:44.080
It is a very goofy language,

04:04:44.080 --> 04:04:47.080
but it's so easy to speak and learn.

04:04:48.080 --> 04:04:50.080
So, if you're ever bored and you're like,

04:04:50.080 --> 04:04:52.080
I want to do something,

04:04:52.080 --> 04:04:54.080
just learn some Dutch, learn the animals.

04:04:54.080 --> 04:04:56.080
The animals are quite funny,

04:04:56.080 --> 04:04:59.080
because you can see how literal it is with animals.

04:04:59.080 --> 04:05:01.080
So, Tartel is shieldpoden,

04:05:01.080 --> 04:05:04.080
which literally shielded,

04:05:04.080 --> 04:05:06.080
and then padded.

04:05:06.080 --> 04:05:08.080
Shieldpoden.

04:05:09.080 --> 04:05:11.080
It seems you are ready to die like a gentleman.

04:05:12.080 --> 04:05:15.080
I've got to learn German since my sister moved there.

04:05:15.080 --> 04:05:17.080
Hello, Lloyd, how are you?

04:05:17.080 --> 04:05:19.080
Are you good?

04:05:19.080 --> 04:05:20.080
Is the grass road?

04:05:20.080 --> 04:05:22.080
No, the grass is groin.

04:05:23.080 --> 04:05:25.080
There's some German for you.

04:05:26.080 --> 04:05:29.080
Right, if we don't touch the floor, we get 100%,

04:05:29.080 --> 04:05:31.080
but it's a bit finicky, honestly.

04:05:32.080 --> 04:05:34.080
So, it's not a big deal if we touch the floor.

04:05:35.080 --> 04:05:38.080
Yeah, the grass is groin, yeah.

04:05:40.080 --> 04:05:44.080
Dine and murder is a lovely lady, yeah.

04:05:48.080 --> 04:05:50.080
Sorry, I'm like completely goofing off right now.

04:05:50.080 --> 04:05:52.080
I'm not even explaining the game anymore.

04:05:52.080 --> 04:05:54.080
I'm just having a good time.

04:05:57.080 --> 04:06:00.080
Most English people have difficulty with the ch.

04:06:00.080 --> 04:06:02.080
I assume that's what you wanted me to say.

04:06:02.080 --> 04:06:06.080
Yeah, in Scots to say a lock, which is a lake,

04:06:06.080 --> 04:06:09.080
you say a loch, loch.

04:06:11.080 --> 04:06:13.080
And then we also roll our r's.

04:06:13.080 --> 04:06:17.080
It's not girl, it's girl, girl.

04:06:17.080 --> 04:06:22.080
So, Scots kind of naturally have a buff for other languages,

04:06:22.080 --> 04:06:26.080
which is pretty handy when you're trying to impress someone.

04:06:26.080 --> 04:06:31.080
I think to say, all day every day in...

04:06:34.080 --> 04:06:37.080
All day, took one Taiwan, all day every day in Vietnamese.

04:06:37.080 --> 04:06:39.080
Nah, I don't think that's right.

04:06:39.080 --> 04:06:40.080
Please perish.

04:06:41.080 --> 04:06:43.080
Give me a clap, Papo.

04:06:45.080 --> 04:06:46.080
I'm gonna clap them.

04:06:47.080 --> 04:06:48.080
Sorry.

04:06:50.080 --> 04:06:52.080
Yeah, this is just a classic tailing mission.

04:06:52.080 --> 04:06:55.080
You're not to be out of their POV for 25 seconds.

04:06:56.080 --> 04:06:57.080
We are tailing the banker.

04:06:57.080 --> 04:06:59.080
He currently has our Jussie Jussie money,

04:06:59.080 --> 04:07:02.080
which we do get back at the end of this mission.

04:07:03.080 --> 04:07:06.080
I thought it's he was about to jump on the floor there,

04:07:06.080 --> 04:07:09.080
and I was about to inhale a big inhale.

04:07:12.080 --> 04:07:14.080
Khef me in clap, Papo.

04:07:14.080 --> 04:07:15.080
Me spank me daddy.

04:07:15.080 --> 04:07:16.080
Oh!

04:07:17.080 --> 04:07:19.080
Khef me in clap, Papo.

04:07:19.080 --> 04:07:20.080
There you go.

04:07:21.080 --> 04:07:24.080
To the one Dutch person listening in right now,

04:07:24.080 --> 04:07:27.080
he's having the time of his life.

04:07:27.080 --> 04:07:29.080
He is absolutely on it.

04:07:30.080 --> 04:07:32.080
He's like, I'll see your belief.

04:07:32.080 --> 04:07:33.080
Oh, no, that's please.

04:07:33.080 --> 04:07:34.080
How do you say mercy?

04:07:34.080 --> 04:07:35.080
How do you say thank you?

04:07:35.080 --> 04:07:36.080
Thank you, Bill.

04:07:36.080 --> 04:07:37.080
He's like, oh, thank you, Bill.

04:07:37.080 --> 04:07:38.080
Strawberry.

04:07:38.080 --> 04:07:39.080
Thank you, Bill.

04:07:39.080 --> 04:07:40.080
And his reactant.

04:07:42.080 --> 04:07:43.080
It's me.

04:07:45.080 --> 04:07:46.080
That's it.

04:07:46.080 --> 04:07:49.080
I know like the other stuff, like Iquil.

04:07:49.080 --> 04:07:51.080
It's like I won, like Iquiline.

04:07:51.080 --> 04:07:52.080
Iquiline.

04:07:52.080 --> 04:07:53.080
Go, go, go, go.

04:07:54.080 --> 04:07:57.080
If you are a human, you say Iquiline.

04:07:57.080 --> 04:07:58.080
Go, go, go, go.

04:07:58.080 --> 04:08:02.080
If you are en vrou, Iquil.

04:08:05.080 --> 04:08:07.080
Is he gonna get me in trouble?

04:08:07.080 --> 04:08:08.080
I don't.

04:08:08.080 --> 04:08:12.080
I think I can like kill this guy from the box.

04:08:12.080 --> 04:08:14.080
What's inside the box?

04:08:14.080 --> 04:08:15.080
Nothing.

04:08:15.080 --> 04:08:16.080
I'm stuck.

04:08:16.080 --> 04:08:17.080
Please get out.

04:08:17.080 --> 04:08:18.080
Okay.

04:08:18.080 --> 04:08:20.080
That was funny and unique.

04:08:20.080 --> 04:08:22.080
Please don't do that again.

04:08:22.080 --> 04:08:26.080
I always forget how to navigate this part.

04:08:26.080 --> 04:08:27.080
Are you a fish?

04:08:27.080 --> 04:08:29.080
I'm a cuttlefish.

04:08:29.080 --> 04:08:31.080
I'm a little piece of paper.

04:08:31.080 --> 04:08:34.080
Because I do hypnosis.

04:08:34.080 --> 04:08:37.080
But I've yet to actually make a hypnosis.

04:08:37.080 --> 04:08:39.080
Well, I have a hypnosis audio coming out.

04:08:39.080 --> 04:08:43.080
But like an actual free to view one, like ASMR stuff.

04:08:43.080 --> 04:08:46.080
Oh, can I need to get on that?

04:08:46.080 --> 04:08:49.080
We go cold again, but it sounds terrible.

04:08:49.080 --> 04:08:53.080
I'm kind of glad because I literally have so much ASMR stuff I need to edit.

04:08:53.080 --> 04:08:59.080
And basically I need to wake up and then work before stream.

04:08:59.080 --> 04:09:02.080
Because after stream, I can't do anything.

04:09:02.080 --> 04:09:04.080
I don't want to kill this.

04:09:07.080 --> 04:09:09.080
Someone's up there.

04:09:13.080 --> 04:09:17.080
I really don't want to kill because if you put the bodies on the floor,

04:09:17.080 --> 04:09:21.080
sometimes the bodies desync this.

04:09:21.080 --> 04:09:23.080
Please stop.

04:09:23.080 --> 04:09:26.080
Are you kidding me?

04:09:26.080 --> 04:09:28.080
This thing was don't be detected.

04:09:28.080 --> 04:09:29.080
I messed that up.

04:09:29.080 --> 04:09:30.080
My goodness.

04:09:30.080 --> 04:09:31.080
No, don't fall.

04:09:31.080 --> 04:09:32.080
Okay.

04:09:32.080 --> 04:09:33.080
It's fine.

04:09:33.080 --> 04:09:34.080
The senator's right there.

04:09:34.080 --> 04:09:35.080
The banker's over there.

04:09:35.080 --> 04:09:36.080
Well, failed anyway.

04:09:36.080 --> 04:09:38.080
It doesn't matter if I touch the floor.

04:09:38.080 --> 04:09:39.080
Oh.

04:09:39.080 --> 04:09:40.080
You brought the money.

04:09:40.080 --> 04:09:41.080
Well, well.

04:09:41.080 --> 04:09:42.080
Yeah.

04:09:42.080 --> 04:09:45.080
The banker has a special evening plan.

04:09:45.080 --> 04:09:48.080
I'm either on Twitter or on YouTube, but I've got three ASMR videos.

04:09:48.080 --> 04:09:52.080
I need to come out and be like, thanks for 3,000 subscribers.

04:09:52.080 --> 04:09:53.080
Subscribblers.

04:09:53.080 --> 04:09:55.080
I better not lose sight of that.

04:09:55.080 --> 04:09:56.080
Yeah.

04:09:56.080 --> 04:10:03.080
Basically YouTube, like my stats say that I've been like subscribed to like over 5,000 subscribers.

04:10:03.080 --> 04:10:08.080
But obviously, like, because we've been getting cold, it like keeps going down again.

04:10:08.080 --> 04:10:09.080
And it's like, oh, okay.

04:10:09.080 --> 04:10:10.080
I guess.

04:10:10.080 --> 04:10:12.080
But, oh no, I can't leave.

04:10:12.080 --> 04:10:14.080
Oh, I don't have to leave.

04:10:14.080 --> 04:10:15.080
How do I get up here?

04:10:15.080 --> 04:10:16.080
What are you thinking?

04:10:16.080 --> 04:10:17.080
Where's the law?

04:10:17.080 --> 04:10:18.080
Oh.

04:10:18.080 --> 04:10:19.080
How do I get up here?

04:10:19.080 --> 04:10:20.080
Yeah.

04:10:20.080 --> 04:10:21.080
Oh.

04:10:21.080 --> 04:10:25.080
Well, Vila only stream on YouTube.

04:10:25.080 --> 04:10:27.080
There'll be Twitch streams.

04:10:27.080 --> 04:10:35.320
Um, not really interested in Twitch because of the arbitrary, like, you're fine, but you're

04:10:35.320 --> 04:10:36.320
not fine.

04:10:36.320 --> 04:10:37.320
And yeah.

04:10:37.320 --> 04:10:42.600
Whereas like YouTube, at least it's kind of like there's definitely an open status

04:10:42.600 --> 04:10:43.600
quo with YouTube.

04:10:43.600 --> 04:10:47.600
And that's much easier to, like, freaking sick.

04:10:47.600 --> 04:10:48.600
Ezio.

04:10:48.600 --> 04:10:49.600
Darling.

04:10:49.600 --> 04:10:50.600
Hen.

04:10:50.600 --> 04:10:52.600
You're stressing me out.

04:10:52.600 --> 04:10:53.600
Get up.

04:10:53.600 --> 04:10:54.600
Get it up.

04:10:54.600 --> 04:10:55.600
Don't be nervous.

04:10:55.600 --> 04:10:56.600
One in three men.

04:10:56.600 --> 04:10:57.600
Get it up.

04:10:57.600 --> 04:10:58.600
What do you mean?

04:10:58.600 --> 04:11:02.600
I'm putting more pressure on you to perform.

04:11:02.600 --> 04:11:03.600
Get it up.

04:11:03.600 --> 04:11:07.600
Maybe that would be a really funny audio.

04:11:08.600 --> 04:11:13.600
Like, I'm absolutely desperate and I'm like, get up, get up, get up.

04:11:13.600 --> 04:11:16.600
But I'm feeling that'd be really, maybe for a meme audio.

04:11:16.600 --> 04:11:17.600
I can do that.

04:11:17.600 --> 04:11:20.600
I don't think that'd be a really funny audio.

04:11:20.600 --> 04:11:27.600
I get, like, really aggressive, like, come on.

04:11:27.600 --> 04:11:31.600
I've never been all on some before.

04:11:31.600 --> 04:11:33.600
A lot of people have been.

04:11:33.600 --> 04:11:34.600
Yeah.

04:11:34.600 --> 04:11:37.600
The culling stops once, like, more content comes up.

04:11:37.600 --> 04:11:42.600
So once I finish the stream, YouTube is going to have to admit to itself that I have 8,000

04:11:42.600 --> 04:11:43.600
hours.

04:11:43.600 --> 04:11:44.600
No.

04:11:44.600 --> 04:11:49.600
I have eight hours in Assassin's Creed and, yeah, people were, like, actually interacting

04:11:49.600 --> 04:11:50.600
and stuff on stream.

04:11:50.600 --> 04:11:52.600
So, yeah, YouTube.

04:11:52.600 --> 04:11:54.600
Strongly won.

04:11:54.600 --> 04:11:55.600
YouTube zero.

04:11:55.600 --> 04:11:59.600
And the girls have been absolutely fantastic about the culling as well.

04:11:59.600 --> 04:12:03.600
Like, they have been, I asked them.

04:12:03.600 --> 04:12:06.600
Like, I do not expect the girls to stream every single day.

04:12:06.600 --> 04:12:08.600
I've told them countless times.

04:12:08.600 --> 04:12:11.600
The only reason I can do it is because I have Rotism, your honour.

04:12:11.600 --> 04:12:17.600
But I did ask them, like, hey, for the first week, you're most likely going to have the

04:12:17.600 --> 04:12:18.600
most views.

04:12:18.600 --> 04:12:23.600
Like, you'll kind of, like, the debuff, no, buff from debut.

04:12:23.600 --> 04:12:28.600
And, like, all of them were like, yeah, I'll give it my all.

04:12:28.600 --> 04:12:30.600
Like, I'll stream as much as I can in the first week.

04:12:30.600 --> 04:12:32.600
So freaking thankful and grateful.

04:12:32.600 --> 04:12:38.600
And, like, I really think it will, like, completely help with the culling and all that jazz.

04:12:38.600 --> 04:12:42.600
So this mission is bizarre.

04:12:42.600 --> 04:12:46.600
You basically have to guess the path of where you need to go.

04:12:46.600 --> 04:12:48.600
And, of course, I haven't unlocked the map.

04:12:48.600 --> 04:12:50.600
So I've freaking done it wrong already.

04:12:50.600 --> 04:12:52.600
Is it this way?

04:12:52.600 --> 04:12:54.600
But you're also timed as well.

04:12:54.600 --> 04:12:58.600
And I don't think I can remember off the top of my head.

04:12:58.600 --> 04:13:02.600
I think I have to go up these stairs.

04:13:06.600 --> 04:13:09.600
No, right, I'm going the wrong way.

04:13:09.600 --> 04:13:12.600
So they get, like, suspicious of you if you go the wrong way.

04:13:12.600 --> 04:13:17.600
And it's like, I'm sorry.

04:13:17.600 --> 04:13:21.600
Oh, I know, like, the general idea, but I don't know the right way, 100%.

04:13:21.600 --> 04:13:27.600
I don't even remember going past these portals, honestly.

04:13:27.600 --> 04:13:32.600
I think we go right of the church.

04:13:32.600 --> 04:13:35.600
And there's, like, upstairs, right of the church.

04:13:35.600 --> 04:13:38.600
My brain is telling me.

04:13:38.600 --> 04:13:41.600
Goodness.

04:13:41.600 --> 04:13:44.600
Yes, and then take a left under here, and then the bridge that's up ahead.

04:13:44.600 --> 04:13:46.600
Okay, I think we've already nailed it.

04:13:46.600 --> 04:13:51.600
That is literally how much I've put to scoop.

04:13:51.600 --> 04:13:54.600
The noise keeps putting me off, but, like, I know where I'm going.

04:13:54.600 --> 04:13:57.600
Okay, geez.

04:13:57.600 --> 04:13:59.600
Literally, this is the correct way.

04:13:59.600 --> 04:14:01.600
And the game's like, I was suspicious.

04:14:01.600 --> 04:14:03.600
No, this is the correct way, and I know it is.

04:14:03.600 --> 04:14:06.600
I've played it enough to know this is the right way.

04:14:06.600 --> 04:14:07.600
This is the way.

04:14:07.600 --> 04:14:09.600
Anyone watch Mandalorian?

04:14:09.600 --> 04:14:11.600
Grogo's adorable.

04:14:11.600 --> 04:14:12.600
Grogo.

04:14:12.600 --> 04:14:13.600
See, there we go.

04:14:13.600 --> 04:14:15.600
We did it.

04:14:15.600 --> 04:14:18.600
And yeah, that's all we have to do.

04:14:18.600 --> 04:14:21.600
And we have completed this section.

04:14:21.600 --> 04:14:25.600
None, none, more than an angry scorn.

04:14:25.600 --> 04:14:28.600
Oh, yeah.

04:14:28.600 --> 04:14:31.600
PayPal.

04:14:31.600 --> 04:14:34.600
I don't know what's going on with the PayPal for the business,

04:14:34.600 --> 04:14:36.600
because we literally submitted.

04:14:36.600 --> 04:14:39.600
It has been established for months.

04:14:39.600 --> 04:14:41.600
Like, all the stuff we've established for months.

04:14:41.600 --> 04:14:46.600
I think, unironically, you guys were supporting, like, A.C.

04:14:46.600 --> 04:14:50.600
and me so much that PayPal's like, this is suspicious.

04:14:50.600 --> 04:14:52.600
And then the PayPal's now blocked.

04:14:52.600 --> 04:14:56.600
So thank you for all the support you've shown the girls already.

04:14:56.600 --> 04:14:59.600
You literally got the account suspended.

04:14:59.600 --> 04:15:04.600
You've literally, like, so much support you've suspended

04:15:04.600 --> 04:15:07.600
being able to support the girls' monetary,

04:15:07.600 --> 04:15:11.600
which is hilarious if you think of it.

04:15:11.600 --> 04:15:14.600
Okay, we're just tailing the guards.

04:15:14.600 --> 04:15:16.600
This is the course on mission I was talking about,

04:15:16.600 --> 04:15:18.600
which is necessary to have them.

04:15:18.600 --> 04:15:21.600
And if you avoid the guards as much as possible

04:15:21.600 --> 04:15:23.600
to hold on to the group for as long as possible

04:15:23.600 --> 04:15:26.600
because you have two sets of girls

04:15:26.600 --> 04:15:29.600
that will go out to distract guards.

04:15:29.600 --> 04:15:32.600
But if you get too close to guards and you didn't want to distract,

04:15:32.600 --> 04:15:34.600
they essentially get wasted.

04:15:34.600 --> 04:15:39.600
And it's about me literally suffering from success.

04:15:39.600 --> 04:15:45.600
I think management managed to pay everyone

04:15:45.600 --> 04:15:50.600
for the watch-alongs in time before that happened.

04:15:50.600 --> 04:15:53.600
But I hope so, because there was a lot of money.

04:15:53.600 --> 04:15:55.600
I think, like, the total for sponsors...

04:15:55.600 --> 04:15:58.600
No! We lost a group to that.

04:15:58.600 --> 04:16:01.600
To the PayPal.

04:16:01.600 --> 04:16:06.600
I think the total of, like, sponsorships was, like...

04:16:06.600 --> 04:16:07.600
I don't mind talking about this,

04:16:07.600 --> 04:16:10.600
was, like, roughly in the 5,000 US dollars mark

04:16:10.600 --> 04:16:14.600
for everyone, like, compiled.

04:16:14.600 --> 04:16:17.600
The original budget was, like, 20,000,

04:16:17.600 --> 04:16:22.600
but hardly anyone was replying to the agency.

04:16:22.600 --> 04:16:29.600
So shout out to Umi Plus and shout out to VNU Agency.

04:16:29.600 --> 04:16:33.600
Don't be surprised if you see us collaborating with them.

04:16:33.600 --> 04:16:36.600
They were fantastic and lovely

04:16:36.600 --> 04:16:39.600
and actually gave us the time of day.

04:16:39.600 --> 04:16:41.600
Um...

04:16:41.600 --> 04:16:43.600
Yeah.

04:16:44.600 --> 04:16:47.600
So don't be surprised if you see us working with those girls

04:16:47.600 --> 04:16:50.600
because their agency was kind enough to give us the time of day,

04:16:50.600 --> 04:16:55.600
whereas pretty much everyone else ignored us, so...

04:16:55.600 --> 04:16:57.600
Yeah.

04:17:01.600 --> 04:17:02.600
Happy it went well.

04:17:02.600 --> 04:17:06.600
Yes, the watch-alongs were a complete success.

04:17:06.600 --> 04:17:12.600
Special thank you to everyone who did them and all of that jazz.

04:17:13.600 --> 04:17:16.600
I'm currently listening to flirting in my ear

04:17:16.600 --> 04:17:17.600
because I just heard her say,

04:17:17.600 --> 04:17:21.600
Priest of Confession or something like that.

04:17:21.600 --> 04:17:23.600
Oh, my God.

04:17:23.600 --> 04:17:28.600
What happens if we had a nun design, okay?

04:17:28.600 --> 04:17:32.600
But then she had, like, a real design under it,

04:17:32.600 --> 04:17:34.600
but we promote her as, like, a genuine,

04:17:34.600 --> 04:17:36.600
like, completely covered up nun.

04:17:36.600 --> 04:17:39.600
And, like, the promo artwork is at her voice lines

04:17:39.600 --> 04:17:42.600
or, like, super conservative and everything.

04:17:42.600 --> 04:17:45.600
And then, on debut, she reveals her real design.

04:17:45.600 --> 04:17:47.600
That'd be so cool.

04:17:47.600 --> 04:17:48.600
I'm allowed to say this stuff out loud

04:17:48.600 --> 04:17:50.600
because I don't control the design,

04:17:50.600 --> 04:17:52.600
so I'm allowed to say this stuff.

04:17:52.600 --> 04:17:54.600
Um...

04:17:54.600 --> 04:17:56.600
I've got none to do with it.

04:17:56.600 --> 04:17:57.600
Uh...

04:17:57.600 --> 04:18:00.600
I love having no more responsibilities.

04:18:00.600 --> 04:18:01.600
There's not gonna be a Fond de la Buse

04:18:01.600 --> 04:18:04.600
because I don't have that responsibility anymore.

04:18:04.600 --> 04:18:06.600
Yay!

04:18:06.600 --> 04:18:09.600
But admit it, you love Fond de la Buse.

04:18:16.600 --> 04:18:18.600
I'm allowed to do it.

04:18:24.600 --> 04:18:27.600
Seeing you all to come alive was so fun.

04:18:27.600 --> 04:18:28.600
Did you, like, see in the behind the scenes

04:18:28.600 --> 04:18:31.600
of how we all looked?

04:18:31.600 --> 04:18:35.600
I am very interested in getting a Celtic design.

04:18:35.600 --> 04:18:39.600
Uh, I'm gonna say something controversial, Karen.

04:18:39.600 --> 04:18:43.600
I actually don't, like, have Mbuba on Vichubama Do.

04:18:43.600 --> 04:18:45.600
And not my thing.

04:18:45.600 --> 04:18:47.600
And, like, the cleavage and all that.

04:18:47.600 --> 04:18:50.600
No, not my thing.

04:18:50.600 --> 04:18:54.600
No, he got yo-inged by two of the freaking girls.

04:18:54.600 --> 04:18:55.600
Are you so dumb?

04:18:55.600 --> 04:18:58.600
Why would you do that?

04:18:58.600 --> 04:19:00.600
Grrr.

04:19:00.600 --> 04:19:02.600
V's sucking my fame age is like,

04:19:02.600 --> 04:19:06.600
bruv, it was rough.

04:19:06.600 --> 04:19:07.600
It was rough.

04:19:07.600 --> 04:19:08.600
Development was rough.

04:19:08.600 --> 04:19:09.600
I'm very happy.

04:19:09.600 --> 04:19:11.600
I never have to develop anything ever again.

04:19:11.600 --> 04:19:13.600
Like, it's completely off-handed.

04:19:13.600 --> 04:19:15.600
I no longer have to do anything.

04:19:15.600 --> 04:19:19.600
And it's so, it's such a good feeling.

04:19:19.600 --> 04:19:21.600
Right, we're just gonna hire these courtesans

04:19:21.600 --> 04:19:23.600
to make sure all is good.

04:19:23.600 --> 04:19:27.600
But I think we're, like, pretty safe.

04:19:27.600 --> 04:19:28.600
Make yourself flat.

04:19:28.600 --> 04:19:31.600
Honestly, I might.

04:19:31.600 --> 04:19:35.600
Um, in an alternative costume or something.

04:19:35.600 --> 04:19:36.600
Design.

04:19:36.600 --> 04:19:39.600
Alternative outfit, that's what you say.

04:19:39.600 --> 04:19:40.600
Target is on the move.

04:19:40.600 --> 04:19:45.600
I repeat, tango is on the move.

04:19:45.600 --> 04:19:46.600
Alpha.

04:19:46.600 --> 04:19:47.600
Bravo.

04:19:47.600 --> 04:19:48.600
Charlie.

04:19:48.600 --> 04:19:49.600
Delta.

04:19:49.600 --> 04:19:50.600
Echo.

04:19:50.600 --> 04:19:51.600
Foxtrot.

04:19:51.600 --> 04:19:52.600
Gamma.

04:19:52.600 --> 04:19:53.600
Indigo.

04:19:53.600 --> 04:19:54.600
I don't know if that's alphabet.

04:19:54.600 --> 04:19:55.600
Right, right, right.

04:19:55.600 --> 04:19:57.600
Girls, girls, put your arm down.

04:19:57.600 --> 04:19:59.600
Put your arm down.

04:19:59.600 --> 04:20:01.600
Into the hay bale of we go.

04:20:01.600 --> 04:20:04.600
The hay bale of shame.

04:20:04.600 --> 04:20:05.600
But big plus for you.

04:20:05.600 --> 04:20:08.600
Behind the scenes and the info.

04:20:08.600 --> 04:20:11.600
What better way to celebrate my victims

04:20:11.600 --> 04:20:13.600
than to join in the brotherhood?

04:20:13.600 --> 04:20:17.600
Yeah, like, I'm really, not really bothered for secrets.

04:20:17.600 --> 04:20:18.600
It's like, how do you do this?

04:20:18.600 --> 04:20:20.600
Well, put a lot of money behind it.

04:20:20.600 --> 04:20:21.600
Okay, how do you do that?

04:20:21.600 --> 04:20:23.600
Well, put a lot of money behind it.

04:20:23.600 --> 04:20:25.600
If you ever want to start a VTuber agency,

04:20:25.600 --> 04:20:27.600
I'm gonna say this to you,

04:20:27.600 --> 04:20:30.600
and this is the best advice you will ever get.

04:20:30.600 --> 04:20:32.600
Whatever you think it's gonna cost,

04:20:32.600 --> 04:20:33.600
double it,

04:20:33.600 --> 04:20:35.600
and then give it some more.

04:20:35.600 --> 04:20:37.600
Whatever time you think it's gonna take,

04:20:37.600 --> 04:20:38.600
double it,

04:20:38.600 --> 04:20:41.600
and give it some more.

04:20:41.600 --> 04:20:48.600
I had a lot of issues with, um,

04:20:48.600 --> 04:20:51.600
like, artists going past, like, deadlines.

04:20:51.600 --> 04:20:55.600
So, everything slid back into me,

04:20:55.600 --> 04:20:57.600
and it was horrific for me,

04:20:57.600 --> 04:21:00.600
which is why I don't have a lot of things done.

04:21:00.600 --> 04:21:02.600
Like, my ASMR audios are recorded,

04:21:02.600 --> 04:21:05.600
but they aren't edited for you that go on YouTube.

04:21:05.600 --> 04:21:08.600
And it's a shame because I wanted to have that all done,

04:21:08.600 --> 04:21:10.600
but, you know, things happened and stuff happens,

04:21:10.600 --> 04:21:11.600
and...

04:21:11.600 --> 04:21:13.600
But everything's been fantastic.

04:21:13.600 --> 04:21:15.600
Like, the reception the girls received,

04:21:15.600 --> 04:21:18.600
like, I'm just so glad people are, like, loving on them

04:21:18.600 --> 04:21:20.600
and just so happy with them.

04:21:20.600 --> 04:21:22.600
Like, um,

04:21:22.600 --> 04:21:25.600
it was, like, not easy to have...

04:21:25.600 --> 04:21:26.600
I'm about to get caught,

04:21:26.600 --> 04:21:28.600
because I'm freaking sitting on a wall.

04:21:28.600 --> 04:21:32.600
It was, like, not easy to, like,

04:21:32.600 --> 04:21:34.600
assign people a pre-made model.

04:21:34.600 --> 04:21:36.600
Like, I saw some people, like, ask,

04:21:36.600 --> 04:21:39.600
like, why don't they just create the models themselves

04:21:39.600 --> 04:21:40.600
that they like?

04:21:40.600 --> 04:21:42.600
And it's like, you have...

04:21:42.600 --> 04:21:44.600
I understand that Idol End do that.

04:21:44.600 --> 04:21:47.600
You have no idea how freaking hard it is

04:21:47.600 --> 04:21:49.600
to coordinate, like, X amount of modellers

04:21:49.600 --> 04:21:51.600
to come together, to come make a concept,

04:21:51.600 --> 04:21:52.600
come to this, come to that.

04:21:52.600 --> 04:21:54.600
I am not doing that approach.

04:21:54.600 --> 04:21:57.600
Please do not think the other is going to end up doing that approach.

04:21:57.600 --> 04:21:59.600
However, the girls are more than welcome to...

04:21:59.600 --> 04:22:02.600
Hello? Hello? No, we missed a...

04:22:03.600 --> 04:22:06.600
We missed the opportunity to assassinate them.

04:22:06.600 --> 04:22:07.600
Bruh.

04:22:07.600 --> 04:22:09.600
Come back here right now. My goodness.

04:22:09.600 --> 04:22:11.600
Come back here.

04:22:11.600 --> 04:22:13.600
Oh, right. Well, just do it later.

04:22:13.600 --> 04:22:14.600
Oh, but just...

04:22:14.600 --> 04:22:16.600
Are you supposed to walk right in front of us?

04:22:16.600 --> 04:22:19.600
I think the court is on its path and maybe mess them up.

04:22:19.600 --> 04:22:20.600
Bruh, get right back here.

04:22:21.600 --> 04:22:23.600
But yeah, I am more than happy for the girls

04:22:23.600 --> 04:22:26.600
to tell me what they want for alternative outfits and stuff.

04:22:26.600 --> 04:22:28.600
That's not a problem at all.

04:22:30.600 --> 04:22:35.600
But to do a debut that has input from the start,

04:22:35.600 --> 04:22:40.600
that's like being signed on in development

04:22:40.600 --> 04:22:42.600
is like six months in the making.

04:22:42.600 --> 04:22:45.600
No one wants to be hanging about six months

04:22:45.600 --> 04:22:48.600
waiting for their new job to start.

04:22:48.600 --> 04:22:50.600
Yano?

04:22:50.600 --> 04:22:52.600
Oh, Meru. Hi, Meru.

04:22:52.600 --> 04:22:53.600
How are you doing?

04:22:53.600 --> 04:22:55.600
He has a game.

04:22:56.600 --> 04:22:57.600
Amy's gone live.

04:22:57.600 --> 04:22:58.600
Okay. Amy...

04:22:58.600 --> 04:23:00.600
Oh, whoops, I was in pain and tension.

04:23:00.600 --> 04:23:03.600
Hold on, I'm getting walloped by a frickin' lance.

04:23:03.600 --> 04:23:05.600
Oh, no, the hay bale!

04:23:06.600 --> 04:23:08.600
Oh, my ankles!

04:23:10.600 --> 04:23:12.600
The hay bale! I missed...

04:23:12.600 --> 04:23:14.600
Oh, that's more guards!

04:23:14.600 --> 04:23:16.600
I'm just... I'm hiding in the corner.

04:23:16.600 --> 04:23:18.600
There's so many guards around me.

04:23:24.600 --> 04:23:27.600
Oh, my God! How did they all follow me here?

04:23:27.600 --> 04:23:29.600
All right, I'm calling in the assassins.

04:23:29.600 --> 04:23:30.600
You're stuck.

04:23:31.600 --> 04:23:33.600
Oh, my God.

04:23:33.600 --> 04:23:35.600
There is so many.

04:23:40.600 --> 04:23:42.600
Rip the ankles, I know.

04:23:46.600 --> 04:23:48.600
Funny you come in here, Meru.

04:23:48.600 --> 04:23:50.600
I was just talking about your agency.

04:23:52.600 --> 04:23:54.600
I was seeing how Yumi Plus

04:23:54.600 --> 04:23:57.600
is one of the very few agencies

04:23:57.600 --> 04:24:00.600
that responded to the watch-along offers

04:24:00.600 --> 04:24:02.600
that VLR made.

04:24:02.600 --> 04:24:05.600
Suspicious shout-out to Yumi Plus.

04:24:05.600 --> 04:24:08.600
We love Yumi Plus out here.

04:24:10.600 --> 04:24:12.600
They found us in two seconds.

04:24:12.600 --> 04:24:14.600
Literally, I was pinned against that wall.

04:24:14.600 --> 04:24:17.600
I was like, please don't find me, please don't find me, please don't find me.

04:24:17.600 --> 04:24:19.600
Oh, what? Yeah.

04:24:19.600 --> 04:24:21.600
Hardly.

04:24:21.600 --> 04:24:24.600
We were talking about the watch-along sponsors for VLR's debut.

04:24:24.600 --> 04:24:27.600
And your agency and VNU

04:24:27.600 --> 04:24:29.600
were the only two agencies

04:24:29.600 --> 04:24:31.600
that were kind enough to respond to us.

04:24:31.600 --> 04:24:33.600
Where are Claudia and Maria?

04:24:33.600 --> 04:24:35.600
We just talked with the money.

04:24:35.600 --> 04:24:37.600
They followed us all.

04:24:37.600 --> 04:24:39.600
So, we're trying to go to Amy's room.

04:24:39.600 --> 04:24:41.600
I have good news for you.

04:24:41.600 --> 04:24:43.600
I promote you to go to Amy's room.

04:24:43.600 --> 04:24:46.600
So, if any mods you get,

04:24:46.600 --> 04:24:48.600
one speaking permission,

04:24:48.600 --> 04:24:51.600
Amy's stream link.

04:24:51.600 --> 04:24:54.600
That's your only time you're allowed to talk.

04:24:54.600 --> 04:24:57.600
Whoa, what's going on with the code in there?

04:24:57.600 --> 04:24:59.600
I don't think I've seen that before.

04:24:59.600 --> 04:25:02.600
All those numbers?

04:25:02.600 --> 04:25:04.600
No more talking mods.

04:25:04.600 --> 04:25:06.600
Silence!

04:25:06.600 --> 04:25:08.600
Thank you.

04:25:08.600 --> 04:25:11.600
Please enjoy watching AmyBizu.

04:25:11.600 --> 04:25:14.600
I recommend you watch any of my gen-mates when they go live

04:25:14.600 --> 04:25:18.600
because I myself am an endurance streamer.

04:25:18.600 --> 04:25:22.600
And I will be here for many, many an hour.

04:25:22.600 --> 04:25:25.600
I will be trying to finish the campaign mode of this game.

04:25:25.600 --> 04:25:28.600
So, please do not feel any type of way

04:25:28.600 --> 04:25:30.600
if you go to watch any of my gen-mates.

04:25:30.600 --> 04:25:32.600
I absolutely appreciate it and love it.

04:25:32.600 --> 04:25:36.600
Please always consider liking and scrub-scraping

04:25:36.600 --> 04:25:38.600
to their channels.

04:25:38.600 --> 04:25:42.600
I would love to see them get ahead of me sub-wise

04:25:42.600 --> 04:25:45.600
because the girls are fantastic

04:25:45.600 --> 04:25:49.600
and they have so much potential that I see in them.

04:25:49.600 --> 04:25:51.600
And I just want them to...

04:25:51.600 --> 04:25:53.600
I did not want to take your horse.

04:25:53.600 --> 04:25:56.600
Please get back on your horse and leave me alone.

04:25:56.600 --> 04:25:58.600
I apologize.

04:25:58.600 --> 04:26:02.600
Oh, we're still short of the crossbow.

04:26:02.600 --> 04:26:07.600
Maybe we can make enough money if we send the recruits.

04:26:07.600 --> 04:26:10.600
What kind of need the crossbow for this mission that's coming up?

04:26:10.600 --> 04:26:14.600
If you do not have the crossbow, it is a heck on Earth.

04:26:14.600 --> 04:26:16.600
It's not a fun thing.

04:26:16.600 --> 04:26:18.600
Mercy's laugh is so good.

04:26:18.600 --> 04:26:20.600
You're running the content. You didn't say content too?

04:26:20.600 --> 04:26:22.600
Yeah, tomorrow we do all the side content.

04:26:22.600 --> 04:26:26.600
Today we do campaign mode and go back to 100% stuff.

04:26:26.600 --> 04:26:28.600
Yeah, see, look at that money.

04:26:28.600 --> 04:26:32.600
A thousand florins, thousand, thousand...

04:26:32.600 --> 04:26:35.600
Oh, that's also another Scottish slang for you.

04:26:35.600 --> 04:26:38.600
Sometimes you can drop the T-H and make it an E.

04:26:38.600 --> 04:26:43.600
So the number fair T becomes the number fair T.

04:26:43.600 --> 04:26:45.600
I don't know if you can even hear the difference, but yeah, with an F.

04:26:45.600 --> 04:26:47.600
Very.

04:26:49.600 --> 04:26:54.600
Whoa, we have 15,000? That's like so much money.

04:26:54.600 --> 04:26:56.600
I didn't expect that much, actually.

04:26:56.600 --> 04:27:01.600
I'm going to send the assassins on another contract just to get them more XP.

04:27:01.600 --> 04:27:08.600
Because obviously the higher they are, the more likely they are not to fall in battle.

04:27:08.600 --> 04:27:11.600
I really don't want anyone to fall in battle.

04:27:11.600 --> 04:27:13.600
We should get a level up if they come back soon enough.

04:27:13.600 --> 04:27:14.600
Right.

04:27:14.600 --> 04:27:15.600
Someone say gambling time?

04:27:15.600 --> 04:27:19.600
Wait, why is Amy doing it on her stream for you to say gambling time?

04:27:19.600 --> 04:27:21.600
Is she being a naughty?

04:27:21.600 --> 04:27:23.600
Oh, there's a thief down there.

04:27:23.600 --> 04:27:26.600
Oh, I did gamble with all the money.

04:27:26.600 --> 04:27:28.600
No, we're not gambling with the florins.

04:27:28.600 --> 04:27:30.600
I need it for the crossbow ball.

04:27:30.600 --> 04:27:36.600
And then we're going to go and travel to the barracks.

04:27:36.600 --> 04:27:38.600
Come, will be cheap.

04:27:38.600 --> 04:27:40.600
Crossbow ball.

04:27:40.600 --> 04:27:44.600
Best in slot, which is BIS.

04:27:44.600 --> 04:27:46.600
Best in slot or biz for short.

04:27:46.600 --> 04:27:50.600
Any biz.

04:27:50.600 --> 04:27:54.600
She's doing ASMR.

04:27:54.600 --> 04:27:57.600
Oh, that's why she DM'd me asking about that.

04:27:57.600 --> 04:27:59.600
Okay, yeah.

04:27:59.600 --> 04:28:01.600
It makes sense now.

04:28:01.600 --> 04:28:04.600
You may enjoy Amy's ASMR.

04:28:04.600 --> 04:28:12.600
For no particular reason.

04:28:12.600 --> 04:28:14.600
We gamble.

04:28:14.600 --> 04:28:16.600
It's supposed to be ASMR.

04:28:16.600 --> 04:28:18.600
Yeah, I never should.

04:28:18.600 --> 04:28:20.600
I liked it, like ASMR.

04:28:20.600 --> 04:28:23.600
I should DM and she's like, am I allowed to do ear licking?

04:28:23.600 --> 04:28:24.600
I'm like, you know what?

04:28:24.600 --> 04:28:25.600
Just go for it.

04:28:25.600 --> 04:28:32.600
I said, I told her, don't breathe while you do the licking.

04:28:32.600 --> 04:28:35.600
What does she mean by this?

04:28:35.600 --> 04:28:37.600
I'm not that does not surprise me.

04:28:37.600 --> 04:28:40.600
The French puttane have us under pressure.

04:28:40.600 --> 04:28:42.600
Tell me about their gender.

04:28:42.600 --> 04:28:44.600
Hydration check.

04:28:44.600 --> 04:28:47.600
Chairs are a persuaded King Nui to lend him an entire army.

04:28:47.600 --> 04:28:49.600
But don't let go.

04:28:49.600 --> 04:28:52.600
Gamba to impress or discuss the course.

04:28:52.600 --> 04:28:55.600
I don't have time before I have Valois by the throat.

04:28:55.600 --> 04:28:57.600
We have them in a retreat.

04:28:57.600 --> 04:28:59.600
They seem to be getting closer.

04:28:59.600 --> 04:29:00.600
The situation...

04:29:00.600 --> 04:29:02.600
What does that mean?

04:29:02.600 --> 04:29:04.600
Ear licking.

04:29:04.600 --> 04:29:07.600
Benny, so maybe I could use a little help.

04:29:07.600 --> 04:29:10.600
Yeah.

04:29:10.600 --> 04:29:11.600
Don't take any damage.

04:29:11.600 --> 04:29:12.600
Close it.

04:29:12.600 --> 04:29:15.600
Oh, I should have bought smoke bombs.

04:29:15.600 --> 04:29:17.600
This is bizarre.

04:29:17.600 --> 04:29:21.600
They spawned in so many enemies.

04:29:21.600 --> 04:29:24.600
I get it's supposed to be that you're overrun, but...

04:29:24.600 --> 04:29:26.600
My goodness.

04:29:26.600 --> 04:29:28.600
Hold on.

04:29:31.600 --> 04:29:34.600
You can disengage from fights by just running away and jumping.

04:29:34.600 --> 04:29:37.600
For some reason, jumping makes the AI cry.

04:29:37.600 --> 04:29:40.600
The AI will not swing for you if you jump.

04:29:45.600 --> 04:29:47.600
The other entrance.

04:29:47.600 --> 04:29:49.600
Wait a minute.

04:29:49.600 --> 04:29:54.600
That has a double meaning.

04:29:54.600 --> 04:29:56.600
No, no, refling the other entrance.

04:29:56.600 --> 04:29:58.600
The other one.

04:30:02.600 --> 04:30:03.600
Okay.

04:30:03.600 --> 04:30:06.600
Now we destroy all of the baddies.

04:30:10.600 --> 04:30:15.600
Oh, I do love going on a kill street because it's really satisfying.

04:30:15.600 --> 04:30:17.600
Is that everyone?

04:30:18.600 --> 04:30:21.600
The Baron de Rova, signals from the field.

04:30:21.600 --> 04:30:25.600
Oh, bonjour.

04:30:25.600 --> 04:30:28.600
You can come closer and say that.

04:30:28.600 --> 04:30:29.600
Soon, all of...

04:30:29.600 --> 04:30:32.600
Italy, I will be speaking to.

04:30:32.600 --> 04:30:35.600
Very sensibilities.

04:30:40.600 --> 04:30:43.600
It's so nice of them to wait one by one to attack you.

04:30:43.600 --> 04:30:46.600
I know they have such good manners, honestly.

04:30:48.600 --> 04:30:51.600
Mommy, want to explore that?

04:30:51.600 --> 04:30:55.600
I read the funniest thing ever.

04:30:55.600 --> 04:30:58.600
And if you know, you know.

04:30:58.600 --> 04:31:03.600
It was like, what happens if they take my boy cherry?

04:31:03.600 --> 04:31:07.600
And it was like, story will leave you thinking it's...

04:31:09.600 --> 04:31:11.600
I was cackling, reading that.

04:31:11.600 --> 04:31:13.600
I was like...

04:31:14.600 --> 04:31:16.600
I wish you a lot of fun playing Brotherhood.

04:31:16.600 --> 04:31:19.600
Going to watch the stream later in the day.

04:31:19.600 --> 04:31:21.600
Until all of you have fun watching.

04:31:21.600 --> 04:31:23.600
Good night, rest well, sweet dreams.

04:31:23.600 --> 04:31:25.600
Thanks for hanging in.

04:31:30.600 --> 04:31:31.600
Okay, right.

04:31:31.600 --> 04:31:33.600
Look at the speed of this horse.

04:31:33.600 --> 04:31:37.600
These horses are so much slower.

04:31:37.600 --> 04:31:40.600
What did you mean by that?

04:31:40.600 --> 04:31:42.600
Development team of Brotherhood.

04:31:42.600 --> 04:31:47.600
By making the white horse the slowest and the black horse the fastest.

04:31:47.600 --> 04:31:49.600
What did you mean by that?

04:31:49.600 --> 04:31:50.600
Do you want to elaborate?

04:31:50.600 --> 04:31:51.600
No?

04:31:51.600 --> 04:31:52.600
No?

04:31:52.600 --> 04:31:53.600
Okay.

04:31:54.600 --> 04:31:56.600
Something rather odd.

04:31:56.600 --> 04:31:58.600
Rather odd about that.

04:31:58.600 --> 04:32:01.600
But then again, it could just be coincidence.

04:32:01.600 --> 04:32:06.600
But then, is it coincidence if you go up to like...

04:32:06.600 --> 04:32:11.600
The tan horse is faster than the brown horse is faster than the black ones the fastest.

04:32:18.600 --> 04:32:22.600
Should we be offended by a game that was made 14 years ago?

04:32:22.600 --> 04:32:24.600
So deep!

04:32:24.600 --> 04:32:26.600
It reaches out in the mountains!

04:32:34.600 --> 04:32:36.600
Don't let the game journalists hear me.

04:32:36.600 --> 04:32:37.600
Oh no!

04:32:37.600 --> 04:32:39.600
It's candle to be...

04:32:47.600 --> 04:32:49.600
I miss when they can gallop.

04:32:49.600 --> 04:32:50.600
You can still gallop.

04:32:50.600 --> 04:32:51.600
You have to hold A.

04:32:51.600 --> 04:32:55.600
But the problem with galloping is if there's people in the way your horse will fall over.

04:32:59.600 --> 04:33:01.600
Canceled on first game stream.

04:33:01.600 --> 04:33:05.600
Wait, why would I get cancelled if I point out what the development did?

04:33:05.600 --> 04:33:06.600
Why am I getting...

04:33:06.600 --> 04:33:07.600
Hold on a minute.

04:33:07.600 --> 04:33:08.600
No, no, no.

04:33:08.600 --> 04:33:09.600
You can't cancel me.

04:33:09.600 --> 04:33:11.600
My views do not reflect to be a lawyer agency!

04:33:13.600 --> 04:33:14.600
I just screamed that.

04:33:14.600 --> 04:33:17.600
Right, this is my only gripe.

04:33:17.600 --> 04:33:20.600
This is my only gripe with this mission.

04:33:20.600 --> 04:33:24.600
You get left at the gate here only...

04:33:24.600 --> 04:33:30.600
I repeat, you get left at the gate here only to have to horse your way back to the villa

04:33:30.600 --> 04:33:36.600
when the last mission just got you from the barracks to there.

04:33:36.600 --> 04:33:39.600
So you've literally just gone back to like what you just did.

04:33:39.600 --> 04:33:41.600
That's my only gripe.

04:33:42.600 --> 04:33:43.600
That's right with that.

04:33:43.600 --> 04:33:44.600
On the end.

04:33:45.600 --> 04:33:46.600
Oh, I should do.

04:33:46.600 --> 04:33:47.600
It is smart.

04:33:47.600 --> 04:33:51.600
Like just me going for like 30 minutes ear to ear.

04:33:51.600 --> 04:33:52.600
What was that noise?

04:33:52.600 --> 04:33:53.600
Was that a door?

04:33:53.600 --> 04:33:54.600
I sounded like...

04:33:59.600 --> 04:34:02.600
Once inside, your men can overpower the camp's patrols, correct?

04:34:02.600 --> 04:34:03.600
Yes, but...

04:34:03.600 --> 04:34:06.600
Especially if the patrols are taken completely by surprise.

04:34:06.600 --> 04:34:07.600
Yes.

04:34:09.600 --> 04:34:11.600
My ankle, I'm sitting on it.

04:34:11.600 --> 04:34:12.600
Funny, I can't believe it.

04:34:12.600 --> 04:34:13.600
We are going to walk, right?

04:34:13.600 --> 04:34:15.600
That person grunting?

04:34:15.600 --> 04:34:16.600
Literally, man.

04:34:16.600 --> 04:34:19.600
Cody, you're truly a man after my order.

04:34:19.600 --> 04:34:21.600
I'm going to burp, I'm so sorry.

04:34:22.600 --> 04:34:24.600
Oh, that was a...

04:34:24.600 --> 04:34:25.600
Maybe burp.

04:34:25.600 --> 04:34:27.600
My troops will gather it from the day.

04:34:27.600 --> 04:34:29.600
Should have been a frog V to burp.

04:34:29.600 --> 04:34:31.600
That would have been very good.

04:34:31.600 --> 04:34:34.600
Oh, could have been a hypofrog, honestly.

04:34:35.600 --> 04:34:37.600
Do you ever sit normally?

04:34:38.600 --> 04:34:40.600
I honestly cannot sit in a normal chair.

04:34:40.600 --> 04:34:43.600
Maybe I should do a foot cam, like a thigh cam stream.

04:34:43.600 --> 04:34:47.600
And it's just me showing you how badly I sit, like the entire time.

04:34:47.600 --> 04:34:50.600
I thought a foot cam stream during a horror game would be funny

04:34:50.600 --> 04:34:52.600
because you can watch me shake my ankles.

04:34:52.600 --> 04:34:57.600
And I also have a thing where I press my toes into the ground.

04:34:57.600 --> 04:35:01.600
Like, I literally have like little indents on my toes

04:35:01.600 --> 04:35:03.600
from where I press them into the ground

04:35:03.600 --> 04:35:06.600
because of the way my, like, toes like, form over on it.

04:35:06.600 --> 04:35:09.600
I know it sounds really silly, but, you know...

04:35:10.600 --> 04:35:12.600
Sometimes you don't pick the rotism.

04:35:12.600 --> 04:35:14.600
And the rotism picks you.

04:35:17.600 --> 04:35:18.600
Um...

04:35:18.600 --> 04:35:20.600
And we've got three so far.

04:35:23.600 --> 04:35:24.600
That would actually be funny.

04:35:24.600 --> 04:35:26.600
Okay, I'm down for it.

04:35:26.600 --> 04:35:29.600
Wait, okay, my guy's already gone.

04:35:29.600 --> 04:35:32.600
How about five cents on you?

04:35:33.600 --> 04:35:36.600
I don't want to get caught because we can easily 100% this.

04:35:36.600 --> 04:35:39.600
But the assassin recruits take so long.

04:35:39.600 --> 04:35:41.600
Okay, thankfully they got caught in the...

04:35:41.600 --> 04:35:44.600
Whoa, we're getting action shots, like the horse...

04:35:44.600 --> 04:35:45.600
What? Okay.

04:35:45.600 --> 04:35:46.600
Let them get up.

04:35:46.600 --> 04:35:48.600
Look, look, they're a new recruit.

04:35:48.600 --> 04:35:49.600
Let them get up, let them get up.

04:35:51.600 --> 04:35:54.600
Is the other assassin gonna try and help or...?

04:35:55.600 --> 04:35:56.600
No.

04:35:56.600 --> 04:35:58.600
He's just letting them get absolutely lanced.

04:35:59.600 --> 04:36:01.600
Right, I'll help him out.

04:36:01.600 --> 04:36:03.600
Oh, she's losing health, I don't like that.

04:36:03.600 --> 04:36:05.600
There, right, go kill the other guy now.

04:36:06.600 --> 04:36:08.600
No, I got these...

04:36:08.600 --> 04:36:10.600
I got discovered because of that.

04:36:10.600 --> 04:36:12.600
Okay, whoa, we need to help.

04:36:12.600 --> 04:36:14.600
We need to help, they're too strong.

04:36:14.600 --> 04:36:16.600
This guy's too strong.

04:36:16.600 --> 04:36:19.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not the horse, not the horse, not the horse.

04:36:19.600 --> 04:36:22.600
And the boss, and the boss, get him in the boss, hit him in the boss.

04:36:22.600 --> 04:36:24.600
Hit him in the boss, like, don't speak to...

04:36:25.600 --> 04:36:27.600
Okay, okay, okay, okay, horse, it's fine, it's fine.

04:36:27.600 --> 04:36:29.600
I don't know how to go against the horse.

04:36:30.600 --> 04:36:31.600
Please leave me alone.

04:36:32.600 --> 04:36:34.600
I don't know how to deal with horses.

04:36:34.600 --> 04:36:35.600
Okay, there we go.

04:36:35.600 --> 04:36:37.600
Okay, we're dealing with a crossbow ball.

04:36:37.600 --> 04:36:38.600
Jeez.

04:36:40.600 --> 04:36:43.600
Rank 10 assassins are so good, honestly.

04:36:44.600 --> 04:36:47.600
We are very slowly leveling them up.

04:36:48.600 --> 04:36:50.600
I'm wanting to try and pick a fight.

04:36:50.600 --> 04:36:51.600
Can I pick a fight?

04:36:51.600 --> 04:36:52.600
Ooh, feather.

04:36:53.600 --> 04:36:56.600
Look how daintily I jumped over that, that was beautiful.

04:36:56.600 --> 04:36:57.600
Oh, are you stuck?

04:36:57.600 --> 04:36:58.600
Are you okay?

04:36:58.600 --> 04:36:59.600
Have you heard about this?

04:36:59.600 --> 04:37:00.600
Have you heard about this jump?

04:37:00.600 --> 04:37:01.600
Hey, there we go.

04:37:01.600 --> 04:37:03.600
Right, we're going to upset these guys.

04:37:03.600 --> 04:37:05.600
Oh, okay, never mind, okay.

04:37:05.600 --> 04:37:07.600
Wait, that's a barrier?

04:37:08.600 --> 04:37:10.600
That's a barrier.

04:37:10.600 --> 04:37:12.600
Can you jump over them?

04:37:12.600 --> 04:37:14.600
Whoa, I've never seen that before.

04:37:14.600 --> 04:37:16.600
Right, okay, we're going to upset these guards on purpose.

04:37:16.600 --> 04:37:17.600
So we can...

04:37:18.600 --> 04:37:19.600
Ouch!

04:37:19.600 --> 04:37:22.600
I didn't expect that, jeez.

04:37:22.600 --> 04:37:24.600
Oh my goodness.

04:37:24.600 --> 04:37:27.600
I just got double whammy right off the bat.

04:37:27.600 --> 04:37:28.600
Oh my...

04:37:28.600 --> 04:37:29.600
Right, okay.

04:37:29.600 --> 04:37:31.600
I need to take the big guy.

04:37:31.600 --> 04:37:34.600
Thank you, big guy, for perishing.

04:37:34.600 --> 04:37:36.600
Can't handle you.

04:37:36.600 --> 04:37:37.600
Okay, how about that?

04:37:39.600 --> 04:37:40.600
Yeah, big...

04:37:40.600 --> 04:37:41.600
Oh, we need one more.

04:37:41.600 --> 04:37:43.600
Right, who's going to perish?

04:37:43.600 --> 04:37:45.600
You are going to perish.

04:37:47.600 --> 04:37:50.600
Oh, see the horses are getting stuck here.

04:37:50.600 --> 04:37:52.600
I don't know where I'm supposed to go now.

04:37:52.600 --> 04:37:53.600
Oh, I'm good.

04:37:54.600 --> 04:37:56.600
I predict a riot.

04:37:56.600 --> 04:37:58.600
Ooh, do you not want to go down there

04:37:58.600 --> 04:38:00.600
because it's such a nightmare getting out there.

04:38:02.600 --> 04:38:04.600
How many steps is that?

04:38:08.600 --> 04:38:10.600
I don't even think I've done a double kill yet.

04:38:10.600 --> 04:38:12.600
I'm probably going to have to wait till the air stops.

04:38:12.600 --> 04:38:14.600
I'm going to have to go back to the barracks.

04:38:14.600 --> 04:38:16.600
I'm riding a horse and I'm going to go back to the barracks.

04:38:18.600 --> 04:38:20.600
Oh, I'll most likely do a full playthrough

04:38:20.600 --> 04:38:23.600
of Esu's storyline.

04:38:23.600 --> 04:38:25.600
Where am I going?

04:38:26.600 --> 04:38:27.600
Have you seen this?

04:38:30.600 --> 04:38:32.600
Okay, wait, I'm just being deaf.

04:38:33.600 --> 04:38:36.600
Ooh, right, we're going to do this Borgia Tower.

04:38:45.600 --> 04:38:47.600
That's a lot of guards.

04:38:51.600 --> 04:38:54.600
Are we going to hit by Border Patrol?

04:38:56.600 --> 04:38:58.600
We're going to get you.

04:39:00.600 --> 04:39:05.600
And then we're going to just sneak up here and kill you.

04:39:07.600 --> 04:39:10.600
Okay, I'll take that.

04:39:10.600 --> 04:39:12.600
Do you guys need help?

04:39:12.600 --> 04:39:14.600
I'll give you a second recruitment beam

04:39:15.600 --> 04:39:17.600
and let you guys fight it out.

04:39:17.600 --> 04:39:22.600
And I'm going to climb up here and do this.

04:39:22.600 --> 04:39:24.600
Do we skip up here?

04:39:24.600 --> 04:39:26.600
I cannot play Assassin's Creed 1.

04:39:26.600 --> 04:39:27.600
I absolutely suck at it.

04:39:27.600 --> 04:39:28.600
I am so sorry.

04:39:28.600 --> 04:39:30.600
I cannot do it.

04:39:30.600 --> 04:39:32.600
I've tried Beyond Belief.

04:39:32.600 --> 04:39:34.600
I ended up watching someone else play it

04:39:34.600 --> 04:39:36.600
just so I know the storyline.

04:39:36.600 --> 04:39:38.600
Beyond Belief, I'm absolutely trash.

04:39:39.600 --> 04:39:44.600
I probably...

04:39:44.600 --> 04:39:46.600
No, I'm doing variety,

04:39:46.600 --> 04:39:49.600
but what I'll probably do running up to October 10

04:39:49.600 --> 04:39:55.600
is I'll play Assassin's Creed 2 before it,

04:39:55.600 --> 04:39:58.600
then October 10, play Brotherhood again,

04:39:58.600 --> 04:40:01.600
and then after play Revelations,

04:40:01.600 --> 04:40:03.600
and then we'll get the full Ezio story.

04:40:04.600 --> 04:40:09.600
Sometimes it doesn't engage in combat mode,

04:40:09.600 --> 04:40:12.600
and then the enemies get a free hit on you

04:40:12.600 --> 04:40:14.600
because there's nothing you can do.

04:40:14.600 --> 04:40:16.600
I don't know why it does it.

04:40:16.600 --> 04:40:18.600
I mean, I don't know why it does it,

04:40:18.600 --> 04:40:20.600
because stuff and things, but...

04:40:23.600 --> 04:40:25.600
We're level 4.

04:40:25.600 --> 04:40:28.600
We're getting a little bit decent.

04:40:28.600 --> 04:40:29.600
It's not the best.

04:40:29.600 --> 04:40:31.600
We're really not that strong.

04:40:31.600 --> 04:40:33.600
Plumping it all into armor

04:40:33.600 --> 04:40:35.600
because I get so nervous for them.

04:40:36.600 --> 04:40:38.600
I don't want to do a level 4.

04:40:38.600 --> 04:40:40.600
Maybe a 3?

04:40:40.600 --> 04:40:42.600
Send 2 on a level 3

04:40:42.600 --> 04:40:45.600
and split the XP, which is like 100 each.

04:40:45.600 --> 04:40:47.600
Yeah.

04:40:47.600 --> 04:40:48.600
Oh, a second one?

04:40:48.600 --> 04:40:50.600
Okay, we'll do that.

04:40:50.600 --> 04:40:52.600
Okay, that's some all sent to get...

04:40:52.600 --> 04:40:54.600
Oh, my tummy rumbled.

04:40:55.600 --> 04:40:57.600
My tummy rumbled.

04:40:57.600 --> 04:40:59.600
Make me to get some...

04:40:59.600 --> 04:41:00.600
Oh, my tummy rumbled again.

04:41:00.600 --> 04:41:02.600
I don't know if I was getting picked up in the mic,

04:41:02.600 --> 04:41:04.600
but yeah, I think I'm getting a bit peckish

04:41:04.600 --> 04:41:06.600
for, like, actual things.

04:41:06.600 --> 04:41:09.600
You know, sometimes a meat stick doesn't do it.

04:41:09.600 --> 04:41:11.600
Sometimes you need more.

04:41:12.600 --> 04:41:14.600
That...

04:41:14.600 --> 04:41:16.600
There's so many jokes I can make,

04:41:16.600 --> 04:41:17.600
but they're too easy.

04:41:17.600 --> 04:41:18.600
I'm just going to leave it.

04:41:18.600 --> 04:41:20.600
Actually, I'm going to buy smoke bomb pouch if I can.

04:41:22.600 --> 04:41:25.600
It's 9000 Florence!

04:41:25.600 --> 04:41:28.600
Who has 9000 Florence?

04:41:29.600 --> 04:41:31.600
Unreal.

04:41:31.600 --> 04:41:32.600
Unreal Engine.

04:41:32.600 --> 04:41:34.600
Who has 9000 Florence?

04:41:34.600 --> 04:41:35.600
Not me.

04:41:36.600 --> 04:41:38.600
Yeah, two me say.

04:41:38.600 --> 04:41:40.600
You know what they say?

04:41:40.600 --> 04:41:42.600
None in the pink.

04:41:42.600 --> 04:41:44.600
All in the stink.

04:41:47.600 --> 04:41:48.600
Oh, 9000!

04:41:48.600 --> 04:41:50.600
Okay, we're going to get a smoke bomb.

04:41:50.600 --> 04:41:52.600
Excuse-moi, excuse-moi.

04:41:52.600 --> 04:41:54.600
J'ai vu du smoke bomb de pouch.

04:41:54.600 --> 04:41:56.600
Pouch de smoke bomb?

04:41:56.600 --> 04:41:58.600
Smoke bomb de pouch?

04:41:58.600 --> 04:42:00.600
No, not the knife belt.

04:42:00.600 --> 04:42:02.600
Okay, we have smoke bombs, almost.

04:42:02.600 --> 04:42:05.600
We, a viewer, are not serving the talents.

04:42:05.600 --> 04:42:06.600
Okay.

04:42:09.600 --> 04:42:10.600
I can't believe...

04:42:10.600 --> 04:42:14.600
I actually don't get enough of a cut or a split

04:42:14.600 --> 04:42:16.600
that I can't even afford to...

04:42:16.600 --> 04:42:18.600
Oh, there's an assassin recruit down here.

04:42:18.600 --> 04:42:20.600
Yes, I will help you!

04:42:20.600 --> 04:42:22.600
No, let me help you!

04:42:22.600 --> 04:42:23.600
Oh, it's a lady.

04:42:23.600 --> 04:42:25.600
Oh, my lady.

04:42:25.600 --> 04:42:28.600
We actually need to smoke bomb

04:42:28.600 --> 04:42:31.600
because we need to kill people in a smoke bomb.

04:42:32.600 --> 04:42:35.600
For, uh, why...

04:42:35.600 --> 04:42:36.600
What?

04:42:36.600 --> 04:42:39.600
Why do they just get aggressive on us?

04:42:41.600 --> 04:42:43.600
Sometimes you need a group of meat sticks.

04:42:43.600 --> 04:42:44.600
A smart booth.

04:42:44.600 --> 04:42:45.600
Who said that?

04:42:45.600 --> 04:42:47.600
Who said that?

04:42:47.600 --> 04:42:49.600
Maud just put them on a warning.

04:42:49.600 --> 04:42:52.600
Whoever insinuates that the A smart booth

04:42:52.600 --> 04:42:55.600
is going to be utilized for anything but tingling.

04:42:56.600 --> 04:42:58.600
Put them on a warning.

04:42:58.600 --> 04:42:59.600
Don't.

04:42:59.600 --> 04:43:01.600
Teasing.

04:43:03.600 --> 04:43:05.600
I'm teasing.

04:43:05.600 --> 04:43:07.600
I actually think I might need to get...

04:43:07.600 --> 04:43:10.600
I, like, I never noticed that I'm, like, hungry or need to pee,

04:43:10.600 --> 04:43:12.600
and then as soon as I notice it, I'm like,

04:43:12.600 --> 04:43:15.600
ah, I'm perishing, I'm perishing.

04:43:15.600 --> 04:43:18.600
Maud's failed this man's tax return.

04:43:18.600 --> 04:43:20.600
Oh, my God, I cannot wait to...

04:43:20.600 --> 04:43:23.600
I have a funny short coming out about, like,

04:43:23.600 --> 04:43:26.600
what you can get taxed back in a VTuber agency.

04:43:26.600 --> 04:43:29.600
Uh, you know my doughnuts on rewards?

04:43:29.600 --> 04:43:33.600
One of them's going to be a length chart.

04:43:33.600 --> 04:43:36.600
I get to submit that for tax back

04:43:36.600 --> 04:43:40.600
because it's what I needed to do

04:43:40.600 --> 04:43:42.600
in order to operate.

04:43:42.600 --> 04:43:45.600
Like, it's crazy what you can get in tax back.

04:43:45.600 --> 04:43:48.600
Like, obviously it doesn't mean I get the full price of it back in taxes.

04:43:48.600 --> 04:43:51.600
No, it just means, like, the...

04:43:51.600 --> 04:43:55.600
It's like, okay, you can get a few, like, $2 back on your tax return.

04:43:55.600 --> 04:43:56.600
It's like, I think.

04:43:56.600 --> 04:43:58.600
Thanks, appreciate it.

04:43:58.600 --> 04:44:01.600
But, like, yeah, you can get tax back on models,

04:44:01.600 --> 04:44:04.600
get tax back on equipment, get tax back on internet,

04:44:04.600 --> 04:44:07.600
get tax back on, uh, rent as well.

04:44:07.600 --> 04:44:12.600
I get tax back on paying your tax, the stream.

04:44:12.600 --> 04:44:17.600
Oh, I don't even want to think about taxes, honestly.

04:44:17.600 --> 04:44:20.600
Although it was pretty, pretty...

04:44:20.600 --> 04:44:21.600
It reduces what you owe.

04:44:21.600 --> 04:44:24.600
Yes, it doesn't mean I'm going to, like, get the full thing back.

04:44:24.600 --> 04:44:28.600
Sorry, sometimes when people talk about tax back,

04:44:28.600 --> 04:44:32.600
it sounds like they mean you get the full thing back,

04:44:32.600 --> 04:44:34.600
which is not the case at all.

04:44:34.600 --> 04:44:37.600
Everything is a business, right, of, like,

04:44:37.600 --> 04:44:40.600
if you can justify it 100%, like,

04:44:40.600 --> 04:44:43.600
because I can, like, imagine a vealer got audited

04:44:43.600 --> 04:44:45.600
and I have to go, like, oh, yeah, you know,

04:44:45.600 --> 04:44:48.600
this special artwork, um, that was part of the business

04:44:48.600 --> 04:44:51.600
because we're an entertainment business.

04:44:51.600 --> 04:44:54.600
It would be hilarious.

04:44:54.600 --> 04:44:58.600
ASMR Girl IRS agent interrogates you.

04:44:58.600 --> 04:45:00.600
Wait, what am I doing?

04:45:00.600 --> 04:45:02.600
Oh, right in the balls, right?

04:45:02.600 --> 04:45:03.600
Oh!

04:45:03.600 --> 04:45:05.600
Wait, why did...

04:45:05.600 --> 04:45:06.600
Oh!

04:45:06.600 --> 04:45:08.600
Did I just break?

04:45:08.600 --> 04:45:09.600
Oh, my God.

04:45:09.600 --> 04:45:10.600
I'm sorry, I really just...

04:45:10.600 --> 04:45:13.600
Like, the Lance men.

04:45:13.600 --> 04:45:17.600
Small poles only, please, my goodness.

04:45:17.600 --> 04:45:20.600
They're so hard to defeat.

04:45:20.600 --> 04:45:22.600
The company has an account and does everything legally.

04:45:22.600 --> 04:45:23.600
It's by Otonus.

04:45:23.600 --> 04:45:26.600
Okay, dude.

04:45:26.600 --> 04:45:28.600
Management.

04:45:28.600 --> 04:45:32.600
Actually, there's an account and that's true.

04:45:32.600 --> 04:45:36.600
Small poles only, so ogre.

04:45:36.600 --> 04:45:39.600
Wait until he'll tell you about my doctor's visit.

04:45:39.600 --> 04:45:42.600
That's for a later stream.

04:45:42.600 --> 04:45:47.600
You tell it in, like, raw 4K detail about, like, what occurs.

04:45:55.600 --> 04:45:56.600
Right, what am I supposed to do?

04:45:56.600 --> 04:45:58.600
Follow Bartolomeo and his mercenaries.

04:45:58.600 --> 04:45:59.600
Okay.

04:45:59.600 --> 04:46:02.600
Okay, he's about to activate this next thing.

04:46:02.600 --> 04:46:08.600
I am now to perish the guards of my own death gold.

04:46:08.600 --> 04:46:12.600
So this guy can go first.

04:46:12.600 --> 04:46:16.600
And then I can do you.

04:46:16.600 --> 04:46:22.600
And then, last but not least, I can do you.

04:46:22.600 --> 04:46:23.600
No.

04:46:23.600 --> 04:46:26.600
Don't be silly, Ezio.

04:46:26.600 --> 04:46:30.600
Aim on the guard, my goodness.

04:46:30.600 --> 04:46:32.600
By the way, this came...

04:46:32.600 --> 04:46:33.600
What?

04:46:33.600 --> 04:46:36.600
Hello?

04:46:37.600 --> 04:46:39.600
Hello?

04:46:39.600 --> 04:46:43.600
I got desynchronized, but I did what you asked.

04:46:43.600 --> 04:46:48.600
I did everything right and I still lost.

04:46:48.600 --> 04:46:51.600
Wait, this isn't the original checkpoint.

04:46:51.600 --> 04:46:52.600
We still...

04:46:52.600 --> 04:46:59.600
Wait, we hit the checkpoint and it let us go through.

04:46:59.600 --> 04:47:02.600
Okay, okay, okay, I'll take it.

04:47:06.600 --> 04:47:08.600
Okay, next guard checkpoint.

04:47:08.600 --> 04:47:10.600
There's one to our left.

04:47:10.600 --> 04:47:13.600
I might go kill him the new.

04:47:13.600 --> 04:47:15.600
Good day to you.

04:47:15.600 --> 04:47:17.600
Please stop walking.

04:47:17.600 --> 04:47:19.600
Thank you.

04:47:19.600 --> 04:47:23.600
Okay, there's a second guard there.

04:47:23.600 --> 04:47:27.600
I really want to get...

04:47:27.600 --> 04:47:30.600
I need them to split up.

04:47:30.600 --> 04:47:31.600
Focus, focus.

04:47:31.600 --> 04:47:37.600
Focus, there's a pizza on your focus.

04:47:37.600 --> 04:47:39.600
I was too in range.

04:47:39.600 --> 04:47:43.600
If I can time this right, I'm not going to desync.

04:47:43.600 --> 04:47:45.600
I did it.

04:47:45.600 --> 04:47:46.600
Did you see that, though?

04:47:46.600 --> 04:47:47.600
The AI looked at me.

04:47:47.600 --> 04:47:49.600
Oh, my goodness, right?

04:47:49.600 --> 04:47:50.600
What way are you going, Bartolomeo?

04:47:50.600 --> 04:47:52.600
You're going this way.

04:47:52.600 --> 04:47:57.600
That was the way.

04:47:57.600 --> 04:48:00.600
I'm French.

04:48:01.600 --> 04:48:04.600
Freeacak...

04:48:04.600 --> 04:48:06.600
Don't make me sleep!

04:48:06.600 --> 04:48:08.600
I am a French.

04:48:08.600 --> 04:48:11.600
I am a Frenchman.

04:48:11.600 --> 04:48:15.600
I am not Italian or an assassin.

04:48:15.600 --> 04:48:18.600
Ooh, I don't know how...

04:48:18.600 --> 04:48:20.600
But we did get desync to do that.

04:48:21.600 --> 04:48:23.600
We made it which is a funny thing.

04:48:23.600 --> 04:48:26.600
I have a guard right here.

04:48:26.600 --> 04:48:28.600
I don't remember this part.

04:48:28.600 --> 04:48:35.600
All right, you perish. I've got two guards next to each other. I don't like...

04:48:35.600 --> 04:48:40.600
Oh, he's coming this way! Oh, there's a dead body!

04:48:40.600 --> 04:48:44.600
Oh, okay. It's fine.

04:48:44.600 --> 04:48:47.600
Oh, no, he's gone for the dead body!

04:48:47.600 --> 04:48:52.600
I didn't think that through. That was very lucky that we didn't desync all there.

04:48:52.600 --> 04:48:56.600
Phew, we did it. The hard part's over. Now it's for the easy part.

04:48:56.600 --> 04:48:59.600
Where we just walk up to this gate.

04:48:59.600 --> 04:49:07.600
And then we get to learn how French people say Italian dog, which is chien du talien!

04:49:07.600 --> 04:49:13.600
Are you gonna have any European-friendly streams?

04:49:13.600 --> 04:49:20.600
Like, you mean start an earlier than the time I stream right now?

04:49:21.600 --> 04:49:25.600
This is probably going to be my stream start time until...

04:49:25.600 --> 04:49:29.600
Daylight savings kicks in for some places.

04:49:32.600 --> 04:49:34.600
Which part of France are you from?

04:49:34.600 --> 04:49:36.600
Montréal!

04:49:42.600 --> 04:49:44.600
Montréal!

04:49:44.600 --> 04:49:46.600
Open the gate!

04:49:52.600 --> 04:49:54.600
It's E-friendly. It started at 8 p.m.

04:49:54.600 --> 04:49:59.600
It's a bit late if you're, like, German ahead one, or...

04:50:02.600 --> 04:50:06.600
Is this a European-unfriendly stream? Like, do we not like them?

04:50:06.600 --> 04:50:11.600
No, we do. It's just time zones. Like, it's 4 a.m. when I start streaming.

04:50:11.600 --> 04:50:14.600
So, I'm doing my best.

04:50:14.600 --> 04:50:19.600
But I'm an endurance streamer, so I do hit a lot of time zones.

04:50:19.600 --> 04:50:26.600
And it's unlikely, like, reeflings have, like, 8 hours to set, like, through an entire stream.

04:50:26.600 --> 04:50:29.600
Like, maybe if you work from home, or you're listening at work,

04:50:29.600 --> 04:50:32.600
but it's a bit dangerous listening at work, because sometimes I tease a lot.

04:50:32.600 --> 04:50:36.600
Like, especially in ASMR streams, I tease quite a lot.

04:50:36.600 --> 04:50:39.600
This is me just having a really good time.

04:50:39.600 --> 04:50:42.600
So, I'm pretty tame right now, from Brotherhood.

04:50:44.600 --> 04:50:46.600
Repsleepska. Yeah.

04:50:46.600 --> 04:50:48.600
If you live in Turkaya...

04:50:50.600 --> 04:50:53.600
Arkadijim! Arkadijim!

04:50:53.600 --> 04:50:55.600
Means friend.

04:50:55.600 --> 04:50:58.600
And... Turkay.

04:50:59.600 --> 04:51:01.600
I think.

04:51:01.600 --> 04:51:03.600
Enough of your crap.

04:51:03.600 --> 04:51:05.600
Release my wife.

04:51:05.600 --> 04:51:09.600
Such entitlement from a man born with nothing to his name.

04:51:09.600 --> 04:51:12.600
Mine is worth its currency.

04:51:12.600 --> 04:51:16.600
I work from home, and your endurance streams probably end when your work starts.

04:51:16.600 --> 04:51:18.600
So, I'm definitely gonna be...

04:51:18.600 --> 04:51:21.600
How can you focus on working, listening at the same time, though?

04:51:21.600 --> 04:51:25.600
Unless it's, like, background noise. That's different.

04:51:25.600 --> 04:51:30.600
Arkadijim! I learned that from Assassin's Creed Revelations, because it's set in Turkey.

04:51:31.600 --> 04:51:33.600
Never learn.

04:51:40.600 --> 04:51:43.600
These guys are, like, the hardest enemies you can kinda get.

04:51:43.600 --> 04:51:46.600
But if you just jump at them, you can get away with it.

04:51:46.600 --> 04:51:50.600
Well, you just gotta break their stance, and just lick that down.

04:51:50.600 --> 04:51:52.600
And back to me.

04:51:52.600 --> 04:51:55.600
The trick is, I don't really work.

04:51:55.600 --> 04:51:59.600
So, this cutscene is a glitch that was never patched out.

04:51:59.600 --> 04:52:03.600
This is a full edited cutscene, where he, like, go get my wife.

04:52:03.600 --> 04:52:05.600
It never loads. It will never load in time.

04:52:05.600 --> 04:52:07.600
I have no idea what it looks like.

04:52:07.600 --> 04:52:13.600
Well, I assume it looks like him, um, screaming at you, and then he gets his sword and goes offscreen.

04:52:13.600 --> 04:52:16.600
It will never load. It doesn't matter what you do. It never loads.

04:52:16.600 --> 04:52:23.600
Unless, like, maybe someone went into the game data, and, like, I went into free camera, possibly.

04:52:23.600 --> 04:52:25.600
Um...

04:52:25.600 --> 04:52:27.600
Then you could definitely do it.

04:52:27.600 --> 04:52:30.600
I said small poles only!

04:52:32.600 --> 04:52:34.600
We don't want them being p-

04:52:34.600 --> 04:52:36.600
No! You've ruined my speed!

04:52:37.600 --> 04:52:40.600
Okay. We did it, though. It's fine.

04:52:41.600 --> 04:52:43.600
Can I open the gate, please?

04:52:43.600 --> 04:52:45.600
Become anonymous to open the gate?

04:52:45.600 --> 04:52:47.600
There's no one attacking me!

04:52:49.600 --> 04:52:51.600
There's no one attacking me!

04:52:51.600 --> 04:52:54.600
Right, that's what I thought. I was gonna say, there's literally no one attacking me.

04:52:55.600 --> 04:53:00.600
You underwaste my lack of shame. I've listened to some pretty sick stuff at work before.

04:53:03.600 --> 04:53:07.600
Honestly, whatever helps pass the time, like, I'm sorry, but work can be so mundane.

04:53:07.600 --> 04:53:12.600
Like, the best work days are the times where you're super busy, because you blink, and it's the end of the day,

04:53:12.600 --> 04:53:18.600
but you are shattered. That's the only problem. Like, you're absolutely exhausted, and it's really...

04:53:19.600 --> 04:53:26.600
So, you're actually on a timer in this section, and I only have six crossbow bolts, which I do not like at all right now.

04:53:29.600 --> 04:53:33.600
You can. I might mess up the sequence. I do it quite a lot.

04:53:34.600 --> 04:53:36.600
Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't look back!

04:53:43.600 --> 04:53:45.600
Okay, we did it. We did it. We did it. We did it.

04:53:45.600 --> 04:53:47.600
You need to air assassinate him for 100%.

04:53:49.600 --> 04:53:50.600
All done.

04:53:53.600 --> 04:53:55.600
You have no clue how many hours I need to kill in the day.

04:54:01.600 --> 04:54:04.600
Damn, straight respect is earned and not purchased.

04:54:04.600 --> 04:54:05.600
Hmm, hmm.

04:54:10.600 --> 04:54:13.600
Oh, you should probably go to sleep if you need to be up in six hours.

04:54:13.600 --> 04:54:15.600
It's healthy to get eight hours of sleep.

04:54:16.600 --> 04:54:22.600
Digi, no. Men need eight hours of sleep, where women typically need ten hours of sleep.

04:54:23.600 --> 04:54:25.600
But yeah, definitely don't risk your health.

04:54:28.600 --> 04:54:30.600
Sir Shameless, they call me.

04:54:34.600 --> 04:54:37.600
I'll be honest, all your girls make my work day go by real quick.

04:54:37.600 --> 04:54:40.600
It's lovely. Oh, there's some reason to hear.

04:54:42.600 --> 04:54:44.600
AP Gal confirmed Lord.

04:54:57.600 --> 04:55:00.600
Oh my god, VTuber streamer parody of that song. Let's go.

04:55:01.600 --> 04:55:08.600
Okay, then you can collect both of these chests if you're fast enough,

04:55:09.600 --> 04:55:11.600
whilst it's telling you this act is over.

04:55:12.600 --> 04:55:17.600
I swear they purposely did this because no other act takes so long to complete the sequence six,

04:55:17.600 --> 04:55:19.600
like the ending bit to tell you it's over.

04:55:20.600 --> 04:55:22.600
I decided a long time to destroy my sleep schedule.

04:55:23.600 --> 04:55:24.600
That's so legal.

04:55:24.600 --> 04:55:29.600
Forget Paris.

04:55:37.600 --> 04:55:38.600
Worth it feels good.

04:55:41.600 --> 04:55:43.600
Sleep. What is that? I don't need to sleep.

04:55:43.600 --> 04:55:44.600
Oh, she caught me.

04:55:45.600 --> 04:55:49.600
If I can remember this sequence, we may have to...

04:55:50.600 --> 04:55:54.600
Oh, that reminds me, there's actually a thieves challenge,

04:55:54.600 --> 04:55:59.600
which is to dive 200 meters, which you can do off the top of this building.

04:55:59.600 --> 04:56:02.600
So we might as well do it now because we're pretty high up.

04:56:02.600 --> 04:56:03.600
Ready, steady.

04:56:06.600 --> 04:56:09.600
There we go. That's a thieves challenge done right there. Dive complete.

04:56:11.600 --> 04:56:14.600
Oh, I've got a hiring discount on the thieves. Fantastic.

04:56:15.600 --> 04:56:17.600
I... well, enjoy that.

04:56:17.600 --> 04:56:20.600
I need to level them up a bit more before they pickpocket,

04:56:20.600 --> 04:56:22.600
but we're getting close to the point where we don't...

04:56:24.600 --> 04:56:27.600
like Moolah, like that. Where'd any go on the map?

04:56:28.600 --> 04:56:30.600
Where are we? What's our heading?

04:56:31.600 --> 04:56:35.600
Okay, we've liberated that Borgia zone, which is fantastic.

04:56:35.600 --> 04:56:38.600
Where's the mission? Is it south?

04:56:38.600 --> 04:56:41.600
The mission's in the thieves guild,

04:56:41.600 --> 04:56:43.600
which doesn't have a Borgia place on the way,

04:56:43.600 --> 04:56:46.600
but we'll start to try and get all the Borgia towers.

04:56:47.600 --> 04:56:50.600
I'm just going to use the old teleport feature.

04:56:53.600 --> 04:56:54.600
Yeah, yeah.

04:56:54.600 --> 04:56:57.600
And we'll send the assassin recruits on the way to get leveled up a bit more.

04:56:58.600 --> 04:56:59.600
Watching your streams of high level...

04:56:59.600 --> 04:57:00.600
Can you stop that?

04:57:01.600 --> 04:57:02.600
Try and make me blush?

04:57:03.600 --> 04:57:07.600
Like, I'll literally just meme in my butt off playing a really good game.

04:57:08.600 --> 04:57:11.600
Okay, we've got level 5, so we're starting to get a bit...

04:57:11.600 --> 04:57:15.600
I'm going to put it in weapons now just so they have a few more things.

04:57:16.600 --> 04:57:19.600
We need to destroy a tower in order to get our third signal.

04:57:19.600 --> 04:57:22.600
Can I send you guys?

04:57:26.600 --> 04:57:31.600
I'm going to send everyone for the purpose of levelling up that level 1.

04:57:32.600 --> 04:57:35.600
Like, to get them really levelled up from the start.

04:57:35.600 --> 04:57:39.600
So if they do end up in a fight, it's not a problem.

04:57:41.600 --> 04:57:42.600
Is it working? Yes.

04:57:43.600 --> 04:57:46.600
Have you been killing people with your horse?

04:57:47.600 --> 04:57:49.600
Maybe they do.

04:57:50.600 --> 04:57:51.600
No.

04:57:52.600 --> 04:57:54.600
They're not buying it.

04:57:55.600 --> 04:57:58.600
You buy the horse out there.

04:57:59.600 --> 04:58:00.600
He looks like the...

04:58:01.600 --> 04:58:03.600
Oh no, the words aren't working on my head.

04:58:03.600 --> 04:58:07.600
Please don't shoot me and my friend.

04:58:07.600 --> 04:58:10.600
He looks up and he remembers.

04:58:10.600 --> 04:58:12.600
Ooh, I love birds.

04:58:13.600 --> 04:58:17.600
Not at the bird and people die everywhere.

04:58:17.600 --> 04:58:20.600
People die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

04:58:20.600 --> 04:58:24.600
I don't know the words, but like, I know the tune and everything.

04:58:25.600 --> 04:58:26.600
Mmm.

04:58:30.600 --> 04:58:32.600
Strongly means the most important meal of the day.

04:58:40.600 --> 04:58:44.600
We're going to not grab that thief because he's already claimed the wall.

04:58:44.600 --> 04:58:46.600
I never chase thieves.

04:58:46.600 --> 04:58:48.600
If they go up the wall, I cannot be bothered.

04:58:48.600 --> 04:58:50.600
I absolutely cannot be bothered.

04:58:50.600 --> 04:58:54.600
That's probably the only thing in this game that I'm just like, it doesn't matter.

04:58:54.600 --> 04:58:58.600
It's just like if you wanted to poke at the money and whatever item is on their persons.

04:59:01.600 --> 04:59:03.600
What am I doing? What?

04:59:04.600 --> 04:59:05.600
What, do you want to do?

04:59:05.600 --> 04:59:07.600
You guys want to do kegels together?

04:59:08.600 --> 04:59:10.600
Are you ready? Hold for three seconds.

04:59:10.600 --> 04:59:13.600
One, two, three, release.

04:59:14.600 --> 04:59:16.600
You know what, you know what I learned about guys?

04:59:16.600 --> 04:59:17.600
I learned this a while ago.

04:59:17.600 --> 04:59:21.600
If a guy wants to jumpstart his Eiffel Tower,

04:59:21.600 --> 04:59:25.600
he has to close his end, which is crazy.

04:59:25.600 --> 04:59:29.600
A little, a little twitch the, what, twitch it?

04:59:29.600 --> 04:59:31.600
Just so you can, well, twitch it, I guess, yeah.

04:59:32.600 --> 04:59:34.600
Which is crazy lore for guys.

04:59:34.600 --> 04:59:35.600
Absolutely crazy lore.

04:59:37.600 --> 04:59:40.600
Well, I don't know if I was too generic with that.

04:59:40.600 --> 04:59:43.600
In order to achieve sword art.

04:59:43.600 --> 04:59:51.600
Oh, and also when you go with the toilet, you're perlittle.

04:59:51.600 --> 04:59:53.600
I've sent my men out to find him.

04:59:56.600 --> 04:59:57.600
What do we call them?

04:59:58.600 --> 04:59:59.600
You're perlittle.

05:00:02.600 --> 05:00:08.600
I don't know, double eyeballs can touch the toilet and it's super cold and uncomfortable.

05:00:08.600 --> 05:00:12.600
I only learned that super recently because I saw a meme about it.

05:00:12.600 --> 05:00:13.600
And I was like, wait, what?

05:00:14.600 --> 05:00:17.600
You're perlittle guys.

05:00:17.600 --> 05:00:19.600
They're going to retract and save you.

05:00:19.600 --> 05:00:21.600
They get too cold.

05:00:21.600 --> 05:00:24.600
They're going to go straight back up to your belly button.

05:00:24.600 --> 05:00:25.600
No.

05:00:28.600 --> 05:00:29.600
Kill all the attackers.

05:00:29.600 --> 05:00:30.600
Sure, sure, sure.

05:00:36.600 --> 05:00:37.600
Wait, why are we in this?

05:00:37.600 --> 05:00:38.600
Oh, it's a fight.

05:00:38.600 --> 05:00:39.600
It's a fight.

05:00:39.600 --> 05:00:42.600
And I just sent all my assassins away.

05:00:48.600 --> 05:00:49.600
Wrong guy.

05:00:49.600 --> 05:00:50.600
Wrong guy.

05:00:50.600 --> 05:00:52.600
You're hurting the wrong guy, Steve.

05:00:52.600 --> 05:00:54.600
Right, where are the enemies?

05:00:54.600 --> 05:00:57.600
Got an enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.

05:00:57.600 --> 05:00:59.600
Enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.

05:00:59.600 --> 05:01:01.600
Enema, give them an enema.

05:01:04.600 --> 05:01:05.600
Do not give them an enema.

05:01:06.600 --> 05:01:07.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:01:07.600 --> 05:01:08.600
Whoa.

05:01:08.600 --> 05:01:09.600
That was so cool.

05:01:09.600 --> 05:01:11.600
That attack to double splash over.

05:01:11.600 --> 05:01:12.600
I really enjoyed that.

05:01:24.600 --> 05:01:25.600
Ah, go away.

05:01:26.600 --> 05:01:27.600
They scare me.

05:01:27.600 --> 05:01:29.600
That's a nice, oh, I do have three names.

05:01:29.600 --> 05:01:34.600
Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy, bad boy, bad boy.

05:01:34.600 --> 05:01:35.600
Bad boy.

05:01:35.600 --> 05:01:36.600
Oh, I missed.

05:01:41.600 --> 05:01:43.600
Okay, let's get this big guard.

05:01:43.600 --> 05:01:45.600
Oh, wait, I thought I killed him.

05:01:45.600 --> 05:01:47.600
I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry.

05:01:47.600 --> 05:01:49.600
I think I'm going to have to get food and refuel in a second

05:01:49.600 --> 05:01:53.600
because I'm starting to get a little bit delirious.

05:01:53.600 --> 05:01:58.600
I'm going to get some egg and I think I'll go ravioli.

05:02:00.600 --> 05:02:02.600
Maybe a wee bit longer, maybe a three.

05:02:02.600 --> 05:02:04.600
Three whole minutes away from stream.

05:02:04.600 --> 05:02:05.600
I cannot believe it.

05:02:05.600 --> 05:02:06.600
I cannot believe it.

05:02:06.600 --> 05:02:08.600
Absolutely unprofessional, unacceptable.

05:02:11.600 --> 05:02:13.600
Oh, damn it, sorry.

05:02:14.600 --> 05:02:17.600
Everybody wants to be in the Assassin's Creed.

05:02:17.600 --> 05:02:21.600
Brotherhood is really, people quite work with the timing of the song.

05:02:21.600 --> 05:02:23.600
She hates us now.

05:02:24.600 --> 05:02:26.600
How long?

05:02:27.600 --> 05:02:28.600
How many hours?

05:02:28.600 --> 05:02:29.600
Five hours?

05:02:29.600 --> 05:02:31.600
Oh, it's been five hours already.

05:02:31.600 --> 05:02:33.600
I've been gushing about this game.

05:02:33.600 --> 05:02:35.600
You know what, reflings?

05:02:35.600 --> 05:02:37.600
Life's good.

05:02:37.600 --> 05:02:39.600
Full stop, life is good.

05:02:40.600 --> 05:02:42.600
Got doing my thing.

05:02:42.600 --> 05:02:44.600
We having a good time mimin' along.

05:02:44.600 --> 05:02:48.600
I'm rambling away about any old shite that passes my brain.

05:02:49.600 --> 05:02:50.600
Life is good.

05:02:52.600 --> 05:02:55.600
We're about to go get some juice.

05:02:55.600 --> 05:02:57.600
I think I'll make a tea.

05:02:57.600 --> 05:02:59.600
Yeah, I'll make a tea.

05:02:59.600 --> 05:03:02.600
You'll get some food, maybe some snacky too.

05:03:03.600 --> 05:03:04.600
I don't think I need to pee.

05:03:04.600 --> 05:03:06.600
No, no pee yet.

05:03:08.600 --> 05:03:10.600
Actually, I should probably gallop, so I'm not that far behind him,

05:03:10.600 --> 05:03:13.600
because he is like so far ahead of me.

05:03:16.600 --> 05:03:17.600
Oh, no!

05:03:17.600 --> 05:03:18.600
My thieves has perished.

05:03:18.600 --> 05:03:20.600
But thieves are ours.

05:03:21.600 --> 05:03:23.600
Yonkers, you're mine now.

05:03:24.600 --> 05:03:26.600
They are, they are...

05:03:27.600 --> 05:03:30.600
Oh, I don't really want to kick them to death.

05:03:30.600 --> 05:03:31.600
Like, make it quick.

05:03:31.600 --> 05:03:33.600
See, oh, don't make them suffer, my goodness.

05:03:34.600 --> 05:03:35.600
It's a bit morbid.

05:03:35.600 --> 05:03:37.600
See, oh, when you do that, I've done that.

05:03:37.600 --> 05:03:39.600
I think I'd rather like make it quick and painless,

05:03:39.600 --> 05:03:40.600
not like drag it out.

05:03:40.600 --> 05:03:41.600
Oh, he got the horse!

05:03:41.600 --> 05:03:43.600
How did he do that?

05:03:44.600 --> 05:03:46.600
I don't know how he did that, but do it again.

05:03:47.600 --> 05:03:49.600
It looked like he did it with some...

05:03:52.600 --> 05:03:54.600
Well, it's 1AM, so I'll take my leave.

05:03:54.600 --> 05:03:55.600
Please, rest well.

05:03:55.600 --> 05:04:00.600
Anyone who does have to rest or to sleepy bye-bye, please don't worry.

05:04:00.600 --> 05:04:01.600
Odds are.

05:04:01.600 --> 05:04:03.600
I'm actually still going to be streaming by the time you wake up.

05:04:03.600 --> 05:04:04.600
I said it.

05:04:05.600 --> 05:04:06.600
Yeah, it's true.

05:04:06.600 --> 05:04:07.600
It's true.

05:04:07.600 --> 05:04:10.600
I might finish the campaign and I might want to do some more.

05:04:10.600 --> 05:04:11.600
It's true.

05:04:11.600 --> 05:04:12.600
It's true.

05:04:12.600 --> 05:04:13.600
The accusations are true.

05:04:14.600 --> 05:04:16.600
So don't worry if you have to go to bed.

05:04:16.600 --> 05:04:17.600
Might see you when you wake up.

05:04:17.600 --> 05:04:18.600
So sweet dreams.

05:04:19.600 --> 05:04:20.600
See you in the morning.

05:04:20.600 --> 05:04:24.600
Jump off wall.

05:04:24.600 --> 05:04:25.600
Get kicked into wall.

05:04:28.600 --> 05:04:30.600
The accusations are true.

05:04:30.600 --> 05:04:31.600
I'm addicted.

05:04:32.600 --> 05:04:34.600
But not as much as I'm addicted to you.

05:04:34.600 --> 05:04:36.600
You guys might have the nicotine patch on your head,

05:04:36.600 --> 05:04:40.600
but the truth is under these bangs or fringe,

05:04:40.600 --> 05:04:42.600
I've got a nicotine patch too,

05:04:42.600 --> 05:04:44.600
and it's covering my entire forehead.

05:04:44.600 --> 05:04:51.600
I wish I didn't send my sassons on that mission.

05:04:51.600 --> 05:04:52.600
Whoa.

05:04:53.600 --> 05:04:54.600
Okay, there we go.

05:04:55.600 --> 05:04:56.600
This is the Roman bath house.

05:04:56.600 --> 05:04:58.600
This is based on reveal, please.

05:05:00.600 --> 05:05:01.600
They are public bath houses.

05:05:03.600 --> 05:05:04.600
Okay, there's a lot going on.

05:05:04.600 --> 05:05:05.600
Hold on, there's a lot going on.

05:05:05.600 --> 05:05:06.600
Hold on.

05:05:06.600 --> 05:05:07.600
Oh, big armor guy.

05:05:07.600 --> 05:05:08.600
Big armor guy.

05:05:08.600 --> 05:05:09.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:05:09.600 --> 05:05:10.600
Parish.

05:05:11.600 --> 05:05:14.600
My notoriety is going up.

05:05:14.600 --> 05:05:16.600
I like how he just swings that air.

05:05:16.600 --> 05:05:17.600
Whoa.

05:05:17.600 --> 05:05:19.600
Okay, can we get him while he's on the floor?

05:05:19.600 --> 05:05:21.600
Get him on the floor.

05:05:21.600 --> 05:05:22.600
Ow.

05:05:22.600 --> 05:05:24.600
Get him on the floor.

05:05:25.600 --> 05:05:26.600
Lavolpi.

05:05:26.600 --> 05:05:27.600
Lavolpi.

05:05:27.600 --> 05:05:28.600
Old man.

05:05:28.600 --> 05:05:29.600
OG sand.

05:05:29.600 --> 05:05:30.600
Put your Glex on.

05:05:30.600 --> 05:05:32.600
Put your Glex on, OG sand.

05:05:32.600 --> 05:05:34.600
It's me.

05:05:35.600 --> 05:05:38.600
And he is performing in a play in Stanova.

05:05:38.600 --> 05:05:40.600
He played in the first Stanova.

05:05:40.600 --> 05:05:43.600
That was definitely a VA they had used a lot.

05:05:43.600 --> 05:05:45.600
And they were like, please just use any other voice.

05:05:45.600 --> 05:05:47.600
It's going to be so obvious it's you.

05:05:47.600 --> 05:05:51.600
So he had to go stale and play tonight.

05:05:51.600 --> 05:05:53.600
Or a visa game.

05:05:56.600 --> 05:05:57.600
I don't have nicotine.

05:05:57.600 --> 05:05:58.600
I have BLR.

05:05:58.600 --> 05:06:00.600
That's so good.

05:06:00.600 --> 05:06:01.600
Sleep is for the weak.

05:06:01.600 --> 05:06:02.600
I don't know.

05:06:02.600 --> 05:06:03.600
Sleep is very healthy.

05:06:03.600 --> 05:06:06.600
And apparently, if you don't sleep regularly,

05:06:06.600 --> 05:06:09.600
then it's bad for your longevity.

05:06:09.600 --> 05:06:11.600
And you might expire.

05:06:11.600 --> 05:06:15.600
I don't really want you to expire in all honesty.

05:06:15.600 --> 05:06:17.600
I'm going to tell you the truth, chief.

05:06:17.600 --> 05:06:19.600
I'd rather you didn't expire.

05:06:19.600 --> 05:06:22.600
So, please don't.

05:06:23.600 --> 05:06:26.600
We're getting some strawny time, though.

05:06:26.600 --> 05:06:29.600
You're getting strawny time for a very long time every day.

05:06:29.600 --> 05:06:31.600
You could be sick of me.

05:06:31.600 --> 05:06:32.600
Yeah.

05:06:38.600 --> 05:06:40.600
Oh, the music's so good.

05:06:40.600 --> 05:06:42.600
There's also a feather on top of the Colosseum,

05:06:42.600 --> 05:06:44.600
but we can get that at a later time.

05:06:51.600 --> 05:06:53.600
We expire.

05:06:53.600 --> 05:06:55.600
Survive for a moment.

05:06:55.600 --> 05:06:57.600
Not only am I putting you at war,

05:06:57.600 --> 05:06:59.600
I'm now expiring you manually.

05:06:59.600 --> 05:07:01.600
You have been expired.

05:07:02.600 --> 05:07:03.600
Wait, where did he go?

05:07:03.600 --> 05:07:05.600
Oh, I literally glanced away

05:07:05.600 --> 05:07:07.600
and he was perfectly hidden behind Ezio.

05:07:07.600 --> 05:07:09.600
And I was like, oh, where is he?

05:07:10.600 --> 05:07:11.600
All right.

05:07:11.600 --> 05:07:13.600
Enemies, enemies, enemies, enemies.

05:07:13.600 --> 05:07:15.600
Give them an animal.

05:07:15.600 --> 05:07:18.600
Give the enemies an animal for how much?

05:07:19.600 --> 05:07:20.600
What the fuck, you know?

05:07:20.600 --> 05:07:22.600
I'm about, I don't know.

05:07:23.600 --> 05:07:25.600
I'm definitely needing a quick,

05:07:25.600 --> 05:07:27.600
a quick five minute break for you guys.

05:07:27.600 --> 05:07:29.600
We'll just, I'll maybe read some Marshmallows,

05:07:29.600 --> 05:07:31.600
I'm gonna take five minute break,

05:07:31.600 --> 05:07:34.600
and I'll eat and restore my hydration levels and stuff.

05:07:34.600 --> 05:07:36.600
Getting a wee bit delirious.

05:07:36.600 --> 05:07:37.600
Just a wee bit.

05:07:38.600 --> 05:07:40.600
Why is there so many guards this time?

05:07:40.600 --> 05:07:42.600
I don't really recall this game,

05:07:42.600 --> 05:07:44.600
like this part having so many guards.

05:07:45.600 --> 05:07:48.600
Oh, there's a guy on the edge over there.

05:07:50.600 --> 05:07:52.600
Are we all going?

05:07:52.600 --> 05:07:54.600
Okay, he's stuck.

05:07:55.600 --> 05:07:56.600
There, okay, there we go.

05:07:56.600 --> 05:07:58.600
All good, all good in the hood.

05:08:01.600 --> 05:08:03.600
She's got enemies on the brain, Freudian slump.

05:08:03.600 --> 05:08:06.600
And I'm gonna give them, sorry,

05:08:06.600 --> 05:08:08.600
I stuck on my head, it's like a really dumb meme.

05:08:08.600 --> 05:08:10.600
Can I summon Leonardo?

05:08:10.600 --> 05:08:11.600
I can.

05:08:11.600 --> 05:08:12.600
So on these benches,

05:08:12.600 --> 05:08:15.600
is where you can buy more of Leonardo's inventions?

05:08:19.600 --> 05:08:21.600
Is there a thing up there?

05:08:21.600 --> 05:08:23.600
No, it's on the other side.

05:08:25.600 --> 05:08:27.600
Leave me alone.

05:08:35.600 --> 05:08:38.600
What did you ask the scrawny animal marriage when?

05:08:38.600 --> 05:08:41.600
Why are you expecting me to come in the middle of the night?

05:08:41.600 --> 05:08:43.600
Do you think I won?

05:08:47.600 --> 05:08:49.600
I drank a good stretch, yeah.

05:08:49.600 --> 05:08:52.600
Right, we'll finish this sequence

05:08:53.600 --> 05:08:56.600
because I think this is a quick sequence.

05:08:56.600 --> 05:08:58.600
I think we're already like pretty much getting through it.

05:08:58.600 --> 05:09:01.600
We're about to claim the costumes off of enemies.

05:09:02.600 --> 05:09:05.600
Do you think my assassin recruits had finished the mission?

05:09:11.600 --> 05:09:15.600
So, Lavalpe is now convinced Marquio Valley is a thief.

05:09:15.600 --> 05:09:17.600
It is a traitor

05:09:17.600 --> 05:09:20.600
because the events are synchronized

05:09:20.600 --> 05:09:22.600
and not too much.

05:09:22.600 --> 05:09:24.600
Cesare leaves the castle

05:09:24.600 --> 05:09:26.600
when he could have got tipped off.

05:09:26.600 --> 05:09:29.600
Marquio Valley uses guards

05:09:29.600 --> 05:09:32.600
to tell him secrets of the Borgia

05:09:32.600 --> 05:09:36.600
and Lavalpe finds it just far too suspicious

05:09:36.600 --> 05:09:39.600
and he's basically telling us

05:09:39.600 --> 05:09:44.600
if you do not put an end to Lavalpe,

05:09:44.600 --> 05:09:48.600
to Marquio Valley, I'll do it myself.

05:09:50.600 --> 05:09:53.600
Which is scary biscuits and scary beans.

05:09:53.600 --> 05:09:56.600
I'll leave the toes out of the blanket for you.

05:09:56.600 --> 05:09:58.600
Oh my God, did you hear my voice there?

05:09:58.600 --> 05:09:59.600
For you.

05:09:59.600 --> 05:10:00.600
For you.

05:10:00.600 --> 05:10:01.600
For you.

05:10:01.600 --> 05:10:04.600
Would you still love me if I sounded like you?

05:10:08.600 --> 05:10:10.600
I'm wrecking and decking.

05:10:10.600 --> 05:10:12.600
We're on sequence six.

05:10:12.600 --> 05:10:16.600
Act six and there's nine acts together.

05:10:16.600 --> 05:10:19.600
Yes, I right you would.

05:10:20.600 --> 05:10:22.600
I am still your servant and ally.

05:10:22.600 --> 05:10:23.600
Which was an accident.

05:10:23.600 --> 05:10:25.600
Are you demanding that I discount your actions

05:10:25.600 --> 05:10:27.600
and rely on friendship?

05:10:27.600 --> 05:10:29.600
I am asking, not demanding,

05:10:29.600 --> 05:10:31.600
to unite Italia,

05:10:31.600 --> 05:10:33.600
I must have every institute

05:10:33.600 --> 05:10:38.600
and if the church does not fall in love,

05:10:38.600 --> 05:10:41.600
I will eliminate it entirely.

05:10:41.600 --> 05:10:43.600
You know that I really work for you,

05:10:43.600 --> 05:10:44.600
not the folk.

05:10:44.600 --> 05:10:45.600
I can't believe it.

05:10:45.600 --> 05:10:47.600
You said I'm getting rid of Catholicism.

05:10:48.600 --> 05:10:52.600
There's only one way I can know that unconditionally now.

05:10:52.600 --> 05:10:54.600
You intend to kill me.

05:10:54.600 --> 05:10:55.600
You're most loyal friend.

05:10:55.600 --> 05:10:57.600
I have friends that try to tell me that Assassin's Creed.

05:10:57.600 --> 05:10:58.600
Are you letting me go?

05:10:58.600 --> 05:11:01.600
This Assassin's Creed Brotherhood isn't a good game.

05:11:01.600 --> 05:11:02.600
You will not regret it.

05:11:02.600 --> 05:11:04.600
There's so many cool mechanics in Brotherhood,

05:11:04.600 --> 05:11:06.600
wish they didn't steal the DLC though.

05:11:06.600 --> 05:11:09.600
God, give me the costumes for the play.

05:11:09.600 --> 05:11:12.600
It's a shame DLC was really the hype.

05:11:12.600 --> 05:11:14.600
No one else shall have her.

05:11:14.600 --> 05:11:16.600
Make doubly sure it's done correctly.

05:11:16.600 --> 05:11:19.600
He said no one else is allowed to look at it.

05:11:19.600 --> 05:11:21.600
I obey?

05:11:21.600 --> 05:11:24.600
Ooh, that's what we should say to Sheebie.

05:11:24.600 --> 05:11:25.600
We obey.

05:11:25.600 --> 05:11:27.600
We obey.

05:11:27.600 --> 05:11:31.600
We obey Sheebie please.

05:11:31.600 --> 05:11:34.600
Okay, now this horse constantly gets turned around

05:11:34.600 --> 05:11:38.600
so you really can't be too close to him at all.

05:11:38.600 --> 05:11:39.600
We obey Sheebie.

05:11:39.600 --> 05:11:40.600
We obey.

05:11:40.600 --> 05:11:41.600
We do not question.

05:11:41.600 --> 05:11:42.600
We obey.

05:11:46.600 --> 05:11:48.600
Just taking our time with this guy

05:11:48.600 --> 05:11:50.600
because he's so...

05:11:50.600 --> 05:11:53.600
He spins around so easily

05:11:53.600 --> 05:11:55.600
and you can desync so quick.

05:11:59.600 --> 05:12:01.600
Taking our time.

05:12:01.600 --> 05:12:03.600
Easy.

05:12:03.600 --> 05:12:05.600
Use it.

05:12:05.600 --> 05:12:08.600
Ooh.

05:12:08.600 --> 05:12:10.600
This might be the longest hailing mission

05:12:10.600 --> 05:12:12.600
they've actually put in the game.

05:12:12.600 --> 05:12:14.600
Ahhhh.

05:12:14.600 --> 05:12:18.600
This entire act is just tailing missions.

05:12:18.600 --> 05:12:19.600
It's like, tail this person.

05:12:19.600 --> 05:12:20.600
Now don't get me wrong.

05:12:20.600 --> 05:12:23.600
I'm not one of those people that complain about the gameplay.

05:12:23.600 --> 05:12:25.600
Like, if I complained about gameplay,

05:12:25.600 --> 05:12:27.600
I would rather suggest something else

05:12:27.600 --> 05:12:29.600
that's supposed to happen.

05:12:29.600 --> 05:12:33.600
But if you consider all the different types of mechanics

05:12:33.600 --> 05:12:35.600
or subjects that put in the game,

05:12:35.600 --> 05:12:41.600
for example, like the lair of Romulis

05:12:41.600 --> 05:12:43.600
or Leonardo's missions,

05:12:43.600 --> 05:12:45.600
these are completely alternative.

05:12:45.600 --> 05:12:47.600
If you're gonna be like,

05:12:47.600 --> 05:12:48.600
oh, I don't really enjoy tailing missions.

05:12:48.600 --> 05:12:49.600
I completely understand that.

05:12:49.600 --> 05:12:51.600
I'm not dogging on your comment, by the way.

05:12:51.600 --> 05:12:53.600
I'm just discussing it from...

05:12:53.600 --> 05:12:56.600
If you ever wanted to kind of review it.

05:12:56.600 --> 05:12:57.600
Oh, by the way, these guards.

05:12:57.600 --> 05:12:58.600
Useless.

05:12:58.600 --> 05:13:01.600
Absolutely useless.

05:13:01.600 --> 05:13:04.600
You can just walk straight in.

05:13:04.600 --> 05:13:07.600
I think you can also walk past these two

05:13:07.600 --> 05:13:10.600
if you get into that hay bale.

05:13:10.600 --> 05:13:12.600
They just forget you exist.

05:13:12.600 --> 05:13:13.600
They think you're a fart.

05:13:13.600 --> 05:13:15.600
Oh, whoopsies, whoopsies.

05:13:15.600 --> 05:13:17.600
Whoopsies, I wasn't paying attention.

05:13:17.600 --> 05:13:18.600
Whoopsies.

05:13:18.600 --> 05:13:21.600
So it doesn't matter if the guards spot me.

05:13:21.600 --> 05:13:22.600
It's not a problem.

05:13:22.600 --> 05:13:25.600
Although, if I run, it does fulfill the...

05:13:25.600 --> 05:13:27.600
Can you go in the hay bale?

05:13:27.600 --> 05:13:28.600
Jeez, my goodness, gravy.

05:13:28.600 --> 05:13:29.600
It's evil.

05:13:29.600 --> 05:13:31.600
Are you okay?

05:13:31.600 --> 05:13:34.600
Well, nerve is nilly, honestly.

05:13:34.600 --> 05:13:35.600
You can...

05:13:35.600 --> 05:13:37.600
If they stop looking at me...

05:13:37.600 --> 05:13:39.600
Yeah, okay, yeah.

05:13:39.600 --> 05:13:42.600
You hardly have to kill anyone in these kind of things.

05:13:42.600 --> 05:13:44.600
The game is so forgiving.

05:13:44.600 --> 05:13:47.600
That's why I absolutely adore about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

05:13:47.600 --> 05:13:49.600
It is so forgiving.

05:13:49.600 --> 05:13:50.600
Now, don't get me wrong.

05:13:50.600 --> 05:13:52.600
You'll still get a few things where they're like,

05:13:52.600 --> 05:13:55.600
that shouldn't have got me, but yeah.

05:13:55.600 --> 05:13:56.600
It's so forgiving.

05:13:56.600 --> 05:13:57.600
So if you hide in the hay bale,

05:13:57.600 --> 05:13:58.600
wait for this guy to come up,

05:13:58.600 --> 05:14:00.600
and then send him a...

05:14:00.600 --> 05:14:02.600
Oh, he doesn't come up.

05:14:02.600 --> 05:14:04.600
Well, wait for the guy to go away,

05:14:04.600 --> 05:14:05.600
and then...

05:14:05.600 --> 05:14:06.600
Yep, there you go.

05:14:06.600 --> 05:14:08.600
It's so quick.

05:14:14.600 --> 05:14:17.600
So, he gets on a horse.

05:14:17.600 --> 05:14:19.600
You're actually supposed to go over here

05:14:19.600 --> 05:14:21.600
to get on a horse,

05:14:21.600 --> 05:14:23.600
to continue to follow him.

05:14:26.600 --> 05:14:27.600
But it's not really obvious.

05:14:27.600 --> 05:14:29.600
Like, most people would just chase on foot,

05:14:29.600 --> 05:14:31.600
which is completely doable.

05:14:31.600 --> 05:14:33.600
But for some reason, they put the horses...

05:14:33.600 --> 05:14:35.600
A wee bit to the left, and...

05:14:35.600 --> 05:14:37.600
Yeah.

05:14:38.600 --> 05:14:41.600
It's a bit harder to recognise.

05:14:41.600 --> 05:14:42.600
But yeah, definitely this game,

05:14:42.600 --> 05:14:44.600
if you've never played Assassin's Creed before,

05:14:44.600 --> 05:14:46.600
I would actually...

05:14:46.600 --> 05:14:48.600
You'd miss out on the plot of two,

05:14:48.600 --> 05:14:50.600
which is the start of Itzu's story,

05:14:50.600 --> 05:14:53.600
but mechanic and forgiveness-wise.

05:14:53.600 --> 05:14:55.600
If you're not really a strong gamer,

05:14:55.600 --> 05:14:57.600
Brotherhood definitely is one for you.

05:14:57.600 --> 05:14:59.600
Um...

05:14:59.600 --> 05:15:01.600
Ah, my tummy's wobbling if you heard that.

05:15:01.600 --> 05:15:03.600
You probably can't over-the-game play, actually.

05:15:03.600 --> 05:15:04.600
Yeah.

05:15:04.600 --> 05:15:06.600
The fact that you're passionate about the game,

05:15:06.600 --> 05:15:07.600
it's just...

05:15:07.600 --> 05:15:08.600
You latch onto something,

05:15:08.600 --> 05:15:09.600
you can play a game,

05:15:09.600 --> 05:15:11.600
and you have absolutely no idea what to expect,

05:15:11.600 --> 05:15:12.600
and then you just adore it.

05:15:12.600 --> 05:15:15.600
Like, a binding of Isaac is another game.

05:15:15.600 --> 05:15:17.600
I didn't know what to expect,

05:15:17.600 --> 05:15:18.600
and, like, the first time I played it,

05:15:18.600 --> 05:15:20.600
I think I played it for, like, five hours,

05:15:20.600 --> 05:15:21.600
and can't...

05:15:21.600 --> 05:15:24.600
He did the turnaround thing he's now supposed to do,

05:15:24.600 --> 05:15:26.600
and now he's chasing me!

05:15:26.600 --> 05:15:28.600
Leave me alone!

05:15:28.600 --> 05:15:30.600
Oh, my God.

05:15:31.600 --> 05:15:32.600
That was...

05:15:32.600 --> 05:15:34.600
That was gonna desync so hard,

05:15:34.600 --> 05:15:37.600
all because he freakin' turned around!

05:15:37.600 --> 05:15:39.600
I knew you were gonna do that.

05:15:39.600 --> 05:15:40.600
I warned you guys.

05:15:40.600 --> 05:15:43.600
He always turns around in this tail-in mission.

05:15:43.600 --> 05:15:45.600
He gets caught on NPCs,

05:15:45.600 --> 05:15:48.600
and spins around.

05:15:48.600 --> 05:15:50.600
It scares me every time.

05:15:50.600 --> 05:15:53.600
I never expect that...

05:15:53.600 --> 05:15:54.600
He was chasing me, though.

05:15:54.600 --> 05:15:56.600
I don't normally expect them to, like,

05:15:56.600 --> 05:15:58.600
turn around and chase,

05:15:58.600 --> 05:16:01.600
but I guess if you're close enough, they will.

05:16:03.600 --> 05:16:06.600
I'm also gonna visit your mum.

05:16:06.600 --> 05:16:08.600
Um...

05:16:08.600 --> 05:16:09.600
Have a nice visit.

05:16:09.600 --> 05:16:10.600
Sorry.

05:16:10.600 --> 05:16:11.600
I was gonna say something really mean,

05:16:11.600 --> 05:16:13.600
but I refrained.

05:16:13.600 --> 05:16:14.600
I was gonna say,

05:16:14.600 --> 05:16:17.600
I saw her earlier this day.

05:16:17.600 --> 05:16:18.600
Oh, he's done it again!

05:16:18.600 --> 05:16:19.600
No way!

05:16:19.600 --> 05:16:20.600
I'm gonna chat!

05:16:20.600 --> 05:16:21.600
Don't do that again.

05:16:21.600 --> 05:16:22.600
Don't do that again!

05:16:22.600 --> 05:16:26.600
You're giving me a heart attack.

05:16:26.600 --> 05:16:27.600
Goodness me.

05:16:27.600 --> 05:16:29.600
A stronghold's off to visit his mum.

05:16:29.600 --> 05:16:30.600
Doing your mom!

05:16:30.600 --> 05:16:32.600
Doing, doing your mom!

05:16:32.600 --> 05:16:35.600
You know he's strictly doing your mom.

05:16:37.600 --> 05:16:39.600
Um...

05:16:39.600 --> 05:16:40.600
So...

05:16:40.600 --> 05:16:41.600
Oh!

05:16:41.600 --> 05:16:43.600
Please don't attack me.

05:16:43.600 --> 05:16:45.600
Incredible.

05:16:45.600 --> 05:16:47.600
Let the recruits deal with it.

05:16:47.600 --> 05:16:49.600
Oh, this isn't the right way!

05:16:49.600 --> 05:16:51.600
This isn't the way to victory!

05:16:51.600 --> 05:16:52.600
To victory!

05:16:52.600 --> 05:16:53.600
To victory!

05:16:53.600 --> 05:16:54.600
This ain't the way to victory!

05:16:54.600 --> 05:16:56.600
My assassins are now...

05:16:56.600 --> 05:16:58.600
Uh, fighting it out.

05:16:58.600 --> 05:17:01.600
I hope they're leveled up enough to deal with them.

05:17:01.600 --> 05:17:03.600
To deal with them, to deal with them.

05:17:03.600 --> 05:17:05.600
I hope they're leveled up enough to deal with them.

05:17:05.600 --> 05:17:09.600
Because I don't have any more recruits!

05:17:09.600 --> 05:17:10.600
Oh, no!

05:17:10.600 --> 05:17:13.600
I needed recruits to 100% this mission.

05:17:13.600 --> 05:17:17.600
Can I just stand about and wait for them to reappear?

05:17:17.600 --> 05:17:21.600
Because I am patient enough to do that.

05:17:21.600 --> 05:17:23.600
Um...

05:17:23.600 --> 05:17:25.600
Destruction, destruction!

05:17:28.600 --> 05:17:31.600
Oh, I wanna play GTA 4 actually.

05:17:31.600 --> 05:17:33.600
An eco.

05:17:33.600 --> 05:17:35.600
Want to go bowling?

05:17:35.600 --> 05:17:38.600
Oh, they didn't come there.

05:17:38.600 --> 05:17:40.600
One more minute.

05:17:40.600 --> 05:17:42.600
Oh look, they've lost the health bar.

05:17:42.600 --> 05:17:44.600
See, that's why I always put it into health.

05:17:44.600 --> 05:17:47.600
Because they can make as many mistakes as they need to.

05:17:47.600 --> 05:17:51.600
Wait, why am I getting yellowed?

05:17:51.600 --> 05:17:55.600
Why am I getting yellowed when my assassin recruits are going ham?

05:17:55.600 --> 05:17:58.600
Am I not going to be detected? I bloody hope not.

05:17:58.600 --> 05:18:00.600
Right, that's fine. I can be detected.

05:18:00.600 --> 05:18:02.600
Who is shooting?

05:18:02.600 --> 05:18:05.600
What is going on over there?

05:18:05.600 --> 05:18:07.600
Do you not need to reload?

05:18:07.600 --> 05:18:09.600
Hello?

05:18:12.600 --> 05:18:13.600
They just despawned.

05:18:13.600 --> 05:18:16.600
Okay, well, as long as they're not dead, I guess.

05:18:16.600 --> 05:18:19.600
Jeez.

05:18:20.600 --> 05:18:22.600
No, you did not name your...

05:18:22.600 --> 05:18:24.600
No, you didn't...

05:18:24.600 --> 05:18:28.600
Bro, someone in chat has named themselves Fondle of Buzum.

05:18:28.600 --> 05:18:30.600
Frickin...

05:18:30.600 --> 05:18:32.600
No, I can't see it anymore.

05:18:32.600 --> 05:18:34.600
Did Mods time you ever for that?

05:18:34.600 --> 05:18:36.600
That's hilarious.

05:18:36.600 --> 05:18:38.600
You don't need to tell that.

05:18:38.600 --> 05:18:42.600
I read that. It was like Fondle of Buzum, Gen Zero B sucky.

05:18:42.600 --> 05:18:44.600
I don't see it anymore.

05:18:44.600 --> 05:18:46.600
Mods timed out, it was funny.

05:18:46.600 --> 05:18:48.600
Unless you were spamming, then get bonked.

05:18:48.600 --> 05:18:50.600
But that was kind of funny, I have to admit.

05:18:52.600 --> 05:18:54.600
I almost ran out of time there.

05:18:54.600 --> 05:18:56.600
I'm too busy reading chat.

05:18:56.600 --> 05:18:58.600
I literally sounded like a monkey there.

05:18:58.600 --> 05:19:00.600
I'm not even pretending.

05:19:00.600 --> 05:19:02.600
I almost ran out of time.

05:19:05.600 --> 05:19:07.600
Do not turn around again, I'm going to be so upset.

05:19:07.600 --> 05:19:10.600
I don't think he does it too much in the sequence part.

05:19:12.600 --> 05:19:15.600
It's the ghost of Christmas pass, Frickin yeah.

05:19:18.600 --> 05:19:20.600
Yeah.

05:19:26.600 --> 05:19:30.600
My voice literally can't right now.

05:19:30.600 --> 05:19:33.600
Oh, he's getting really far ahead actually, hold on.

05:19:33.600 --> 05:19:36.600
Sorry, I'm just really enjoying reading chat with you.

05:19:36.600 --> 05:19:38.600
I apologize.

05:19:38.600 --> 05:19:43.600
Because I remember that people enjoy when they get their stuff read out.

05:19:43.600 --> 05:19:46.600
I never did my high sing.

05:19:46.600 --> 05:19:48.600
Could I do the high sing?

05:19:48.600 --> 05:19:51.600
So, sometimes when I started upstream,

05:19:51.600 --> 05:19:54.600
I would actually read everyone's name out

05:19:54.600 --> 05:19:57.600
just to try and be super thankful.

05:19:57.600 --> 05:20:01.600
Maybe for the ASMR stream we could try it.

05:20:01.600 --> 05:20:07.600
Because I understand people want to hear their name be said by me.

05:20:07.600 --> 05:20:09.600
Because it's nice to be acknowledged.

05:20:09.600 --> 05:20:15.600
Let's not pretend it's not nice to have streamer reply directly type thing.

05:20:15.600 --> 05:20:17.600
Or like generally discuss it.

05:20:17.600 --> 05:20:20.600
So maybe in the ASMR stream, like as a one off,

05:20:20.600 --> 05:20:23.600
I will try my best to like say hi to everyone.

05:20:23.600 --> 05:20:25.600
You there.

05:20:27.600 --> 05:20:29.600
That's a lot of enemies.

05:20:29.600 --> 05:20:31.600
I got enemies.

05:20:31.600 --> 05:20:33.600
I'm calling in my recruits.

05:20:33.600 --> 05:20:36.600
Okay, let's get to the fight.

05:20:36.600 --> 05:20:38.600
Take this.

05:20:38.600 --> 05:20:40.600
And this.

05:20:40.600 --> 05:20:42.600
And that.

05:20:42.600 --> 05:20:44.600
And this.

05:20:44.600 --> 05:20:46.600
Okay.

05:20:46.600 --> 05:20:49.600
I actually...

05:20:49.600 --> 05:20:54.600
I'm gonna heal up and try and pick up a medicine vial.

05:20:54.600 --> 05:20:56.600
Real names or username?

05:20:56.600 --> 05:20:58.600
I would not say your real names.

05:20:58.600 --> 05:21:01.600
I would never encourage anyone to use their real name.

05:21:01.600 --> 05:21:07.600
On the internet, I name yourself something funny.

05:21:07.600 --> 05:21:12.600
Or after like a video game for example.

05:21:12.600 --> 05:21:14.600
Oh, there's no way I'm getting...

05:21:14.600 --> 05:21:17.600
Is he gonna leave me alone or doesn't he hurt him?

05:21:17.600 --> 05:21:22.600
I'm gonna hurt you if you come any closer.

05:21:22.600 --> 05:21:25.600
It's you! You're aimbot!

05:21:25.600 --> 05:21:28.600
Your armor is not that good, sir.

05:21:28.600 --> 05:21:31.600
I know for a fact your armor is not that good.

05:21:31.600 --> 05:21:33.600
Give me my crossbow bolt back right now.

05:21:33.600 --> 05:21:35.600
I know you have some on your persons.

05:21:35.600 --> 05:21:37.600
Not the knife.

05:21:37.600 --> 05:21:39.600
It's not a knife.

05:21:39.600 --> 05:21:40.600
That's a sword.

05:21:40.600 --> 05:21:42.600
Yeah, exactly. Give me my crossbow bolt back.

05:21:42.600 --> 05:21:44.600
That's exactly what I thought.

05:21:44.600 --> 05:21:48.600
You're not that guy. Trust me, you're not that guy pal.

05:21:48.600 --> 05:21:49.600
I started doing a marathon.

05:21:49.600 --> 05:21:50.600
Imagine if you did Arkham Knight.

05:21:50.600 --> 05:21:52.600
Oh, I did play Batman.

05:21:52.600 --> 05:21:54.600
I'm gonna play the Batman.

05:21:54.600 --> 05:21:56.600
Please don't stop and look at me.

05:21:56.600 --> 05:21:58.600
Please don't stop.

05:22:03.600 --> 05:22:06.600
The assassin should kill that third guy.

05:22:06.600 --> 05:22:08.600
What is going on?

05:22:08.600 --> 05:22:11.600
It's so loud when you guys kill people.

05:22:11.600 --> 05:22:16.600
Okay, now the whole of Roma knows

05:22:16.600 --> 05:22:20.600
that you're shooting guns over there.

05:22:20.600 --> 05:22:23.600
Stranny's not your enemy.

05:22:23.600 --> 05:22:25.600
Oh my god, it's Fond de la Buzum.

05:22:25.600 --> 05:22:28.600
Are you gonna role play Azura?

05:22:28.600 --> 05:22:30.600
In chat?

05:22:34.600 --> 05:22:36.600
Damn, I hope to see it as long as I play.

05:22:36.600 --> 05:22:38.600
It's very long.

05:22:38.600 --> 05:22:40.600
More like can.

05:22:40.600 --> 05:22:42.600
It's a little arm cannon.

05:22:45.600 --> 05:22:48.600
I guess you could go through the live-shot participant tab.

05:22:48.600 --> 05:22:50.600
Wait, I can see a list of everyone watching?

05:22:50.600 --> 05:22:52.600
No, that's only on Twitch.

05:22:54.600 --> 05:22:56.600
Maybe at the start of this ASMR.

05:22:56.600 --> 05:22:59.600
As of one off, because it's just not plausible to keep up.

05:22:59.600 --> 05:23:01.600
But just as a thank you for showing up,

05:23:01.600 --> 05:23:03.600
still being here, still meaming around.

05:23:04.600 --> 05:23:06.600
I haven't played Assassin's Creed,

05:23:06.600 --> 05:23:08.600
but it seems similar to Arkham Knight.

05:23:08.600 --> 05:23:12.600
I wouldn't entirely disagree.

05:23:12.600 --> 05:23:19.600
Very agile, very agility-based.

05:23:19.600 --> 05:23:24.600
Definitely, you know, hunting around.

05:23:24.600 --> 05:23:27.600
This 100% is just don't kill anyone.

05:23:27.600 --> 05:23:30.600
If you scoot your bot all the way along the Colosseum,

05:23:30.600 --> 05:23:32.600
absolutely no issues.

05:23:32.600 --> 05:23:34.600
You shouldn't run into any guards.

05:23:34.600 --> 05:23:36.600
If you do, you can literally just hang off the ledge.

05:23:36.600 --> 05:23:38.600
I wish I had the climbing glove, though.

05:23:38.600 --> 05:23:43.600
That Leonardo bench would have came in clutch for this part of the section.

05:23:43.600 --> 05:23:46.600
But unfortunately...

05:23:46.600 --> 05:23:48.600
I don't have that.

05:23:48.600 --> 05:23:50.600
Where am I supposed to go?

05:23:50.600 --> 05:23:53.600
So the watchpoint is all the way...

05:23:53.600 --> 05:23:55.600
Oh my god, that stance...

05:23:55.600 --> 05:23:57.600
It actually looks pretty funny.

05:24:01.600 --> 05:24:06.600
We're gonna go for this...

05:24:06.600 --> 05:24:09.600
Whoa, I didn't even realize that guard could see me.

05:24:09.600 --> 05:24:11.600
What? How could he even see me?

05:24:11.600 --> 05:24:13.600
We'll go for the viewpoint,

05:24:13.600 --> 05:24:16.600
and then we will continue with this mission.

05:24:16.600 --> 05:24:19.600
This act is getting very close to being finished.

05:24:19.600 --> 05:24:21.600
And then we will have a five-minute break.

05:24:21.600 --> 05:24:23.600
I will read any marshmallows.

05:24:23.600 --> 05:24:26.600
So if you want to ask any questions, you're more than can.

05:24:26.600 --> 05:24:33.600
I did miss some during the 2.0 and the exposing Bielor.

05:24:33.600 --> 05:24:36.600
Not that it wasn't good enough,

05:24:36.600 --> 05:24:38.600
but maybe it wasn't on-subject,

05:24:38.600 --> 05:24:42.600
or didn't quite necessarily relate to me for the 2.0.

05:24:42.600 --> 05:24:44.600
So I just sent it.

05:24:44.600 --> 05:24:46.600
So don't worry, I might give that a good week.

05:24:46.600 --> 05:24:48.600
But you're welcome to ask any questions,

05:24:48.600 --> 05:24:50.600
and then we will rehydrate.

05:24:50.600 --> 05:24:52.600
I'm getting a T.

05:24:52.600 --> 05:24:54.600
My voice is perishing.

05:24:54.600 --> 05:24:57.600
Right, where am I supposed to go?

05:24:57.600 --> 05:24:59.600
Over there?

05:24:59.600 --> 05:25:02.600
There is a feather on top of the Colosseum,

05:25:02.600 --> 05:25:04.600
but I'm actually happy to just climb up again.

05:25:04.600 --> 05:25:06.600
Okay, that's where we're supposed to go.

05:25:06.600 --> 05:25:10.600
Couldn't see it because of the render distance,

05:25:10.600 --> 05:25:13.600
but that's okay, because this is an older game.

05:25:15.600 --> 05:25:18.600
If you look at the three dots where it has time stamps

05:25:18.600 --> 05:25:21.600
and reactions and option to pop out chat,

05:25:21.600 --> 05:25:23.600
I think it's just chatters that have typed in chat.

05:25:23.600 --> 05:25:25.600
I didn't know that.

05:25:25.600 --> 05:25:27.600
I was just going to get you all to be like,

05:25:27.600 --> 05:25:29.600
hi, and then start reading your name,

05:25:29.600 --> 05:25:31.600
ear to ear.

05:25:33.600 --> 05:25:35.600
Senior.

05:25:35.600 --> 05:25:37.600
I've been waiting away for the last hour.

05:25:37.600 --> 05:25:39.600
No, you haven't missed a thing.

05:25:39.600 --> 05:25:41.600
I'm giving away.

05:25:41.600 --> 05:25:45.600
We are on sequence six,

05:25:45.600 --> 05:25:47.600
which is...

05:25:47.600 --> 05:25:49.600
My god!

05:25:49.600 --> 05:25:52.600
Why has thou forsaken me?

05:25:55.600 --> 05:25:56.600
Right, heading out.

05:25:56.600 --> 05:25:57.600
Thank you for hanging.

05:25:57.600 --> 05:25:59.600
Again, anyone who is watching,

05:25:59.600 --> 05:26:01.600
you've done so far.

05:26:01.600 --> 05:26:02.600
You've done well so far.

05:26:02.600 --> 05:26:03.600
It's five and a half hours.

05:26:03.600 --> 05:26:05.600
I don't expect you to be here for the film.

05:26:05.600 --> 05:26:08.600
Please rest when you can.

05:26:08.600 --> 05:26:09.600
And also,

05:26:09.600 --> 05:26:11.600
M.E. is streaming ASMR live.

05:26:11.600 --> 05:26:12.600
If you'd like to check that out,

05:26:12.600 --> 05:26:15.600
M.E.Bizu, she's linked below in my description.

05:26:15.600 --> 05:26:17.600
Thank you so much.

05:26:19.600 --> 05:26:21.600
No more.

05:26:23.600 --> 05:26:26.600
So please don't be afraid to check out her ASMRs.

05:26:26.600 --> 05:26:28.600
We are about to finish up the sequence.

05:26:28.600 --> 05:26:31.600
We just need to eliminate these three guards that come up

05:26:31.600 --> 05:26:34.600
and then deal with the poison sequence.

05:26:34.600 --> 05:26:38.600
And then I believe

05:26:38.600 --> 05:26:41.600
that the sequence is over.

05:26:41.600 --> 05:26:45.600
We are getting very close to finishing the campaign.

05:26:45.600 --> 05:26:47.600
Very, very close.

05:26:47.600 --> 05:26:49.600
Just run all the way around the Colosseum at this section

05:26:49.600 --> 05:26:50.600
until you get up to the hay bale.

05:26:50.600 --> 05:26:51.600
There is a treasure chest.

05:26:51.600 --> 05:26:52.600
I always ignore it.

05:26:52.600 --> 05:26:54.600
We can always come back for it later.

05:26:54.600 --> 05:26:55.600
There you go.

05:26:55.600 --> 05:26:58.600
You can instantly assassinate the hay bale.

05:26:58.600 --> 05:27:01.600
Oh, it's four targets.

05:27:01.600 --> 05:27:05.600
Excuse me, such a fakey gamer.

05:27:05.600 --> 05:27:09.600
Again, crossbow bolts are completely silent.

05:27:09.600 --> 05:27:12.600
They will not allure anyone

05:27:12.600 --> 05:27:15.600
to what has happened in the area,

05:27:15.600 --> 05:27:17.600
which is very nice.

05:27:17.600 --> 05:27:21.600
Unfortunately, I'm running rather low on crossbow bolts.

05:27:21.600 --> 05:27:23.600
We are going to wait for this last guy

05:27:23.600 --> 05:27:25.600
to come out on his own

05:27:25.600 --> 05:27:27.600
because if you actually go in there,

05:27:27.600 --> 05:27:28.600
there is a high chance of him

05:27:28.600 --> 05:27:31.600
just straight up turning around and looking at you.

05:27:31.600 --> 05:27:33.600
And then you have to replay this little section again.

05:27:33.600 --> 05:27:35.600
Don't recommend it up to you,

05:27:35.600 --> 05:27:37.600
but he will notice the body

05:27:37.600 --> 05:27:39.600
and then you get the perfect kill.

05:27:39.600 --> 05:27:41.600
I'm going to look at his body

05:27:41.600 --> 05:27:43.600
just because again, we are a bit low on crossbow bolts.

05:27:43.600 --> 05:27:45.600
But that's okay.

05:27:45.600 --> 05:27:47.600
And then you just need to jump down

05:27:47.600 --> 05:27:50.600
on this little...

05:27:50.600 --> 05:27:52.600
How do you call it?

05:27:52.600 --> 05:27:55.600
Hanging.

05:27:55.600 --> 05:27:56.600
Okay.

05:27:56.600 --> 05:27:58.600
Or just don't touch any of it

05:27:58.600 --> 05:27:59.600
and land on your ankles.

05:27:59.600 --> 05:28:00.600
Perfectly fine.

05:28:00.600 --> 05:28:02.600
Don't need them.

05:28:02.600 --> 05:28:04.600
Just completely ignore everything.

05:28:04.600 --> 05:28:06.600
My goodness.

05:28:06.600 --> 05:28:08.600
You saw me reach my armor.

05:28:09.600 --> 05:28:13.600
Just fall to the floor.

05:28:13.600 --> 05:28:15.600
Literally splat.

05:28:15.600 --> 05:28:18.600
You may notice that our health bar is increasing

05:28:18.600 --> 05:28:21.600
even though I'm not buying any new armor or anything.

05:28:21.600 --> 05:28:23.600
That's because after every act,

05:28:23.600 --> 05:28:25.600
you unlock a new health bar.

05:28:25.600 --> 05:28:30.600
So it's not necessary to use your florins on armor,

05:28:30.600 --> 05:28:34.600
but if you definitely are new to the Assassin's Creed,

05:28:34.600 --> 05:28:35.600
it helps out so much.

05:28:35.600 --> 05:28:36.600
It's fantastic.

05:28:36.600 --> 05:28:39.600
And please utilize the tailor's shops

05:28:39.600 --> 05:28:42.600
because tailor's shops have pouches

05:28:42.600 --> 05:28:45.600
that increase how much medicine you can hold,

05:28:45.600 --> 05:28:47.600
how much throwing knives,

05:28:47.600 --> 05:28:50.600
how many crossbow bolts, for example.

05:28:54.600 --> 05:28:56.600
I cannot recommend this game enough.

05:28:56.600 --> 05:29:00.600
Seriously, it's about eight hours total for campaign.

05:29:00.600 --> 05:29:01.600
If you just ignore everything,

05:29:01.600 --> 05:29:03.600
if you want to have a good time and explore,

05:29:03.600 --> 05:29:07.600
you could easily pump maybe 16 hours.

05:29:09.600 --> 05:29:10.600
It's good. Good game.

05:29:10.600 --> 05:29:12.600
Heavily good game.

05:29:13.600 --> 05:29:15.600
My knees could never do that.

05:29:15.600 --> 05:29:16.600
No, I don't think anyone's knees

05:29:16.600 --> 05:29:18.600
could accomplish such a feat.

05:29:18.600 --> 05:29:21.600
Although, I could have sworn I saw some videos

05:29:21.600 --> 05:29:23.600
of, like, you know, in Portal 2,

05:29:23.600 --> 05:29:25.600
like the apparatus that's on the legs

05:29:25.600 --> 05:29:28.600
to stop any fall damage from occurring.

05:29:28.600 --> 05:29:31.600
I'm sure someone was, like, developing that tech

05:29:31.600 --> 05:29:34.600
at one point, like, maybe for Super Soldier,

05:29:34.600 --> 05:29:37.600
really stuff, but, yeah.

05:29:40.600 --> 05:29:41.600
Are you on Steam?

05:29:41.600 --> 05:29:44.600
Yeah, I'm playing Steam right now.

05:29:44.600 --> 05:29:46.600
I was gonna try and do...

05:29:48.600 --> 05:29:50.600
do an Xbox Game Pass,

05:29:50.600 --> 05:29:52.600
but it's not currently on it right now,

05:29:52.600 --> 05:29:55.600
so we don't get the gamer score.

05:30:02.600 --> 05:30:04.600
Poison Stinky.

05:30:06.600 --> 05:30:09.600
Can anyone look up if Cuttlefish have poison?

05:30:09.600 --> 05:30:11.600
I don't know my lore.

05:30:13.600 --> 05:30:14.600
Maybe my poison can...

05:30:14.600 --> 05:30:17.600
Oh, well, I do ink, but is ink poisonous?

05:30:17.600 --> 05:30:19.600
No, it's a deterrent,

05:30:19.600 --> 05:30:21.600
because I can be preyed upon.

05:30:21.600 --> 05:30:23.600
So ink is the Hayden.

05:30:24.600 --> 05:30:25.600
I can bay.

05:30:25.600 --> 05:30:26.600
Yeah, I can.

05:30:26.600 --> 05:30:28.600
You know, I see my teeth, and...

05:30:32.600 --> 05:30:34.600
I wish I had aim like that, that's cool.

05:30:34.600 --> 05:30:37.600
Actually, that's a really, uh...

05:30:37.600 --> 05:30:39.600
I would...

05:30:39.600 --> 05:30:40.600
No.

05:30:40.600 --> 05:30:41.600
Maybe.

05:30:42.600 --> 05:30:45.600
Do you think we could set up axe throwing

05:30:45.600 --> 05:30:47.600
at a VTuber convention?

05:30:47.600 --> 05:30:49.600
I feel like that would be so fun.

05:30:50.600 --> 05:30:53.600
A lot of people, like, can hit the spot or not.

05:30:53.600 --> 05:30:55.600
I feel like it's so specific.

05:30:55.600 --> 05:30:57.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus!

05:30:57.600 --> 05:30:59.600
Pick them up, pick them up!

05:31:00.600 --> 05:31:02.600
Quite literally, Jesus.

05:31:02.600 --> 05:31:04.600
Oh, his health is going down because of the poison.

05:31:04.600 --> 05:31:06.600
I've never noticed that before.

05:31:09.600 --> 05:31:10.600
Other way.

05:31:10.600 --> 05:31:11.600
Okay.

05:31:11.600 --> 05:31:12.600
Sorry, assassin recruits.

05:31:12.600 --> 05:31:14.600
I'm gonna need you to, like, hurry up

05:31:14.600 --> 05:31:15.600
and perish these people.

05:31:15.600 --> 05:31:17.600
Like, right now, Pietro, is...

05:31:17.600 --> 05:31:18.600
Oh!

05:31:21.600 --> 05:31:23.600
That's a reefling after I'm done with him

05:31:23.600 --> 05:31:25.600
in the ASMR booth.

05:31:25.600 --> 05:31:26.600
Ah...

05:31:30.600 --> 05:31:31.600
Mmm.

05:31:33.600 --> 05:31:35.600
If you team up with a company that does axe throwing...

05:31:38.600 --> 05:31:40.600
Me next, me next!

05:31:44.600 --> 05:31:46.600
This is me giving you cola

05:31:46.600 --> 05:31:48.600
to make you feel better.

05:31:50.600 --> 05:31:51.600
Give me the keys.

05:31:52.600 --> 05:31:54.600
The castello.

05:31:55.600 --> 05:31:56.600
Oh!

05:31:56.600 --> 05:31:58.600
Did I tell you that

05:31:58.600 --> 05:32:00.600
after Dave...

05:32:13.600 --> 05:32:14.600
Oh!

05:32:14.600 --> 05:32:17.600
It's the real traitor!

05:32:17.600 --> 05:32:20.600
It's not Marcia Valley at all!

05:32:21.600 --> 05:32:22.600
It's you!

05:32:22.600 --> 05:32:24.600
Random thief from cutscene.

05:32:25.600 --> 05:32:26.600
Oh, no!

05:32:26.600 --> 05:32:27.600
No!

05:32:27.600 --> 05:32:28.600
No, no!

05:32:28.600 --> 05:32:29.600
No, no, no!

05:32:29.600 --> 05:32:30.600
Horse!

05:32:30.600 --> 05:32:31.600
Please!

05:32:31.600 --> 05:32:32.600
Please!

05:32:33.600 --> 05:32:35.600
Oh, I'm getting chased by a horse right now.

05:32:36.600 --> 05:32:38.600
I don't know, I think if I fail this section...

05:32:39.600 --> 05:32:41.600
If you jump, you can jump past the guards

05:32:41.600 --> 05:32:43.600
and the AI no longer targets you, I don't know why.

05:32:43.600 --> 05:32:45.600
But there's a horse after me

05:32:45.600 --> 05:32:46.600
and I'm scared!

05:32:47.600 --> 05:32:49.600
I can hear the horse go in me!

05:32:51.600 --> 05:32:52.600
Please!

05:32:52.600 --> 05:32:53.600
Please!

05:32:54.600 --> 05:32:55.600
Please leave me alone.

05:32:55.600 --> 05:33:00.480
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

05:33:00.480 --> 05:33:02.760
Okay, I think I'm safe from the horse, silly.

05:33:02.760 --> 05:33:06.720
Come here! Come hither! Come hither!

05:33:06.720 --> 05:33:08.280
Ugh, move on.

05:33:18.200 --> 05:33:19.440
Oh, that was...

05:33:19.440 --> 05:33:20.720
That's awful.

05:33:20.720 --> 05:33:25.120
I was right. I have to stop Levopi before he gets to Machiavelli.

05:33:25.120 --> 05:33:28.200
Ah, Levopi's about to kill Machiavelli! Where'd I go?

05:33:28.200 --> 05:33:30.080
Okay, the green on the map.

05:33:30.080 --> 05:33:33.200
Do I need a horse? I can't remember the section very well.

05:33:33.200 --> 05:33:35.440
Ba-bang. Ba-bang.

05:33:35.440 --> 05:33:36.720
I think I can run.

05:33:36.720 --> 05:33:39.320
Ba-bang. Ba-bang.

05:33:39.320 --> 05:33:45.160
If we do not stop Levopi, he literally kills Machiavelli.

05:33:45.160 --> 05:33:48.720
Now, to 100% this, you're not to swim.

05:33:48.840 --> 05:33:50.040
No! Don't pick...

05:33:50.040 --> 05:33:53.200
Oh, for fuck's sake, take the horse then! Jesus!

05:33:54.160 --> 05:33:56.640
God... Goodness, Gravy.

05:33:57.880 --> 05:34:00.320
Oh my god, I'm taking the long way around!

05:34:00.800 --> 05:34:02.320
Ahhhh!

05:34:02.320 --> 05:34:04.520
Panic! Panic! Panic! Panic! Panic!

05:34:06.480 --> 05:34:08.200
What are you doing in Seal?

05:34:08.200 --> 05:34:12.200
Why would you randomly grab that Permanent's horse?

05:34:12.200 --> 05:34:13.480
Climb the wall!

05:34:13.480 --> 05:34:17.320
It hit Seal! Please, that's a tamed mission.

05:34:17.400 --> 05:34:19.880
They stressed me out so much!

05:34:19.880 --> 05:34:22.920
Please, I just want 100% this, so I never have to do it again.

05:34:22.920 --> 05:34:24.680
Please, please, please!

05:34:24.680 --> 05:34:28.120
Oh, why would you randomly take that Permanent's horse?

05:34:32.360 --> 05:34:35.040
I get too stressed out on tamed missions. I hate them.

05:34:35.040 --> 05:34:37.200
Here, take this letter.

05:34:37.200 --> 05:34:38.240
Luton.

05:34:39.120 --> 05:34:41.840
My god, this is good news.

05:34:41.840 --> 05:34:43.840
More than you know.

05:34:43.840 --> 05:34:46.320
I am once again in your death, Ezio.

05:34:46.360 --> 05:34:48.360
What death is there amongst friends?

05:34:48.360 --> 05:34:49.840
Trust one another.

05:34:49.840 --> 05:34:51.120
Yes.

05:34:51.120 --> 05:34:52.120
Thank you for relaying the message tonight.

05:34:52.120 --> 05:34:54.360
I'm literally yoinked that Permanent's horse.

05:34:54.360 --> 05:34:55.280
Calm, Nicolò.

05:34:55.280 --> 05:34:56.400
Okay.

05:34:56.400 --> 05:34:58.040
Love all pain and mark your will.

05:34:58.040 --> 05:35:01.240
I heard Nicolò's impassioned play took an unexpected turn this week.

05:35:01.240 --> 05:35:02.560
Now trust each other.

05:35:02.560 --> 05:35:03.320
Yippee!

05:35:03.320 --> 05:35:07.840
It seems Jezu Cristo was resurrected three days early.

05:35:10.240 --> 05:35:11.440
Ta-da!

05:35:12.680 --> 05:35:15.040
Checkpoint reached. That's not the end?

05:35:15.040 --> 05:35:16.760
Oh, it is the end of the act.

05:35:16.760 --> 05:35:18.760
We're just being teased.

05:35:20.520 --> 05:35:23.360
Crazy Man's Steel's horse jumps off and runs up wall fight.

05:35:23.360 --> 05:35:28.720
Literally, if you hit, like, a graphic thing like this at an angle,

05:35:28.720 --> 05:35:32.240
Ezio refuses to climb the wall

05:35:32.240 --> 05:35:34.320
and it gives me a heart attack every time.

05:35:34.320 --> 05:35:35.840
Like, Ezio, please.

05:35:38.040 --> 05:35:39.440
Look, our thieves are in the...

05:35:39.440 --> 05:35:41.640
Our recruits are in the background.

05:35:43.000 --> 05:35:44.440
Look, it's you in the background!

05:35:44.480 --> 05:35:45.760
It's you in the car scene!

05:35:45.760 --> 05:35:48.360
Well, they're not right now. I can't see them, but...

05:35:53.360 --> 05:35:54.920
It is pain.

05:35:54.920 --> 05:35:57.960
Claudia's gonna become an assassin.

05:36:01.640 --> 05:36:04.360
We work in the dark to serve the light.

05:36:06.720 --> 05:36:09.680
Yeah, absolutely cannot say any of those words.

05:36:09.680 --> 05:36:12.160
Do not ask me to recite that.

05:36:12.160 --> 05:36:13.480
I can say that part.

05:36:14.320 --> 05:36:17.240
We're in our training. Oh, my God, look who you are! Reflinges!

05:36:17.240 --> 05:36:19.440
There's so many of you.

05:36:19.440 --> 05:36:21.640
Look, Reflinges is my sister.

05:36:23.920 --> 05:36:25.320
I'm reciting it right now.

05:36:36.960 --> 05:36:38.560
Oh, my God, they're gonna hold hands.

05:36:38.560 --> 05:36:39.840
Yay!

05:36:39.840 --> 05:36:41.480
She's an assassin.

05:36:41.480 --> 05:36:44.760
If you get an assassin, you have to be branded on your

05:36:44.760 --> 05:36:46.640
wedding ringer...

05:36:46.640 --> 05:36:47.760
wedding finger.

05:36:49.160 --> 05:36:50.240
Where the ring goes.

05:36:52.280 --> 05:36:53.800
Is your sister single?

05:36:53.800 --> 05:36:54.920
Hi, Claudia.

05:36:56.240 --> 05:36:59.720
You and I have not seen eye-to-eye on many issues.

05:36:59.720 --> 05:37:00.720
Just letting out.

05:37:00.720 --> 05:37:03.080
But you are exactly what the order means.

05:37:03.080 --> 05:37:04.280
We cannot promote it.

05:37:04.280 --> 05:37:06.880
You have led the charge against the Templars

05:37:06.880 --> 05:37:09.160
and rebuilt this brotherhood.

05:37:09.160 --> 05:37:12.360
Now, we must put Ezio when he be locked up.

05:37:12.360 --> 05:37:13.480
Refling!

05:37:13.480 --> 05:37:17.080
Oh, my God, is Reflinges crowning me as their Ushides?

05:37:17.080 --> 05:37:19.920
Ezio, Auditore, Daffy Vence.

05:37:19.920 --> 05:37:22.800
You will now be known as Il Mentore,

05:37:22.800 --> 05:37:25.360
the guardian of our order and our cities.

05:37:27.640 --> 05:37:29.280
No, I can't be Kama Ushii.

05:37:29.280 --> 05:37:32.280
I don't mean Ushii, but Kama Ushii is impossible to live up to.

05:37:32.280 --> 05:37:33.480
That's not possible.

05:37:33.480 --> 05:37:34.960
Remember, nothing is true.

05:37:34.960 --> 05:37:35.880
It's true.

05:37:35.880 --> 05:37:37.680
Everything is permanent.

05:37:37.760 --> 05:37:41.360
Where other men are limited by morality and law.

05:37:41.360 --> 05:37:44.120
Remember, everything is permitted.

05:37:46.960 --> 05:37:48.400
It's Ezio before or after.

05:37:48.400 --> 05:37:49.240
He is after.

05:37:49.240 --> 05:37:50.720
Altair is like...

05:37:51.720 --> 05:37:53.720
I don't even know what century Altair is.

05:37:54.840 --> 05:37:56.440
Why this sudden change of heart?

05:37:56.440 --> 05:37:57.760
I'm a cameo assassin.

05:37:59.120 --> 05:38:01.600
I was the one who brought you to Roma

05:38:01.600 --> 05:38:04.600
and the one who caused the explosion as you fled the Castello.

05:38:04.600 --> 05:38:05.520
What?

05:38:05.520 --> 05:38:09.920
The mercenaries who protected you at Il Colosseo were mine as well.

05:38:09.920 --> 05:38:11.560
You just did not know it.

05:38:11.560 --> 05:38:15.240
Maestro Mattiaveli, Cesare has returned to Roma alone.

05:38:15.240 --> 05:38:16.960
He rides for the Castel Sant'Angelo.

05:38:16.960 --> 05:38:17.800
Thank you.

05:38:18.880 --> 05:38:20.720
Well...

05:38:20.720 --> 05:38:23.440
The decision is yours, not mine.

05:38:23.440 --> 05:38:27.600
Niccolo, you better not stop telling me what you think.

05:38:27.600 --> 05:38:31.640
Why else would I seek the opinion of my most trusted advisor?

05:38:31.640 --> 05:38:33.520
Go kill them, Mentore.

05:38:33.560 --> 05:38:34.840
Finish what you start.

05:38:35.680 --> 05:38:36.680
Good advice.

05:38:39.520 --> 05:38:42.200
I can write a book about you one day.

05:38:42.200 --> 05:38:44.120
If you do, it will be short.

05:38:44.120 --> 05:38:45.800
You've been my OSHA since day one, just accept it.

05:38:45.800 --> 05:38:48.240
I don't get it, like how?

05:38:48.240 --> 05:38:49.680
How?

05:38:49.680 --> 05:38:53.880
You tell me you've consumed all of these content creators

05:38:53.880 --> 05:38:55.440
and you're like...

05:38:55.440 --> 05:38:56.640
Yeah.

05:38:56.640 --> 05:38:57.600
That one.

05:38:57.600 --> 05:38:58.520
Out of them all.

05:38:58.520 --> 05:38:59.360
Okay.

05:39:00.360 --> 05:39:02.480
We have finished Sequence Seven.

05:39:02.480 --> 05:39:07.600
There are two more sequences and then we've done the campaign.

05:39:07.600 --> 05:39:09.720
It's actually finishing a lot earlier than I thought.

05:39:09.720 --> 05:39:13.080
I've still got a couple of more hours in me, okay?

05:39:13.080 --> 05:39:14.760
When it clicks, it clicks.

05:39:14.760 --> 05:39:15.800
You don't pick the OSHA.

05:39:15.800 --> 05:39:17.480
The OSHA does pick you.

05:39:20.240 --> 05:39:21.760
When you know, you know.

05:39:21.760 --> 05:39:23.400
Wait, the game is really that short.

05:39:23.400 --> 05:39:26.840
If you ignore everything and do campaign only,

05:39:26.840 --> 05:39:29.800
like, send it on the campaign, then...

05:39:29.800 --> 05:39:31.960
On it, right?

05:39:31.960 --> 05:39:32.800
Pretty.

05:39:32.800 --> 05:39:34.000
You can wrap up.

05:39:35.520 --> 05:39:37.240
Real quick.

05:39:37.240 --> 05:39:41.720
I am going to destroy another tower

05:39:41.720 --> 05:39:45.720
because I want to unlock this third signal

05:39:45.720 --> 05:39:48.440
and then we will...

05:39:48.440 --> 05:39:49.720
Actually, you know what?

05:39:49.720 --> 05:39:53.160
I'm going to send my assassins on a mission.

05:39:53.160 --> 05:39:56.520
I'm going to pee and make a cup of tea and get some food.

05:39:56.840 --> 05:39:59.400
And we can just take a little five minutes to ourselves.

05:39:59.400 --> 05:40:00.800
A little tea break.

05:40:02.760 --> 05:40:05.080
I'll send some of the wee...

05:40:05.080 --> 05:40:07.600
Oh, that's like everyone for that one mission.

05:40:08.960 --> 05:40:11.880
No ideal, but it's fine.

05:40:11.880 --> 05:40:13.000
Can you 100% not?

05:40:13.000 --> 05:40:14.720
You can, so that will be a level up.

05:40:14.720 --> 05:40:16.000
Okay.

05:40:16.000 --> 05:40:19.000
Right, everyone.

05:40:19.000 --> 05:40:20.440
I don't want to be too close to the pigeons

05:40:20.440 --> 05:40:22.360
because they literally go...

05:40:22.360 --> 05:40:25.520
in your ear, so hopefully that's not too bad

05:40:25.520 --> 05:40:27.760
for ambience.

05:40:27.760 --> 05:40:30.760
Everyone, please do consider standing up

05:40:30.760 --> 05:40:34.600
and getting your wee legs and blood flow going

05:40:34.600 --> 05:40:35.600
or wiggle your toes.

05:40:35.600 --> 05:40:37.480
If you're that lazy, stretch your feet

05:40:37.480 --> 05:40:38.880
and pull them back and forth

05:40:38.880 --> 05:40:41.960
so your muscles and your calves

05:40:41.960 --> 05:40:43.600
like come back and forth.

05:40:43.600 --> 05:40:46.320
Go for a pee, get some water, some snacks,

05:40:46.320 --> 05:40:49.400
some juicy juice, hypotenuse,

05:40:49.400 --> 05:40:54.400
and I will be back in roughly three minutes.

05:40:55.160 --> 05:40:59.040
I'm gonna try and heat up ravioli like fast as anything.

05:41:00.560 --> 05:41:01.800
So I will be a moment.

05:41:01.800 --> 05:41:04.720
If you would like to watch Emmy while she does ASMR live,

05:41:04.720 --> 05:41:06.160
her link is in my description.

05:41:06.160 --> 05:41:08.440
You can do that right now, okay?

05:41:08.440 --> 05:41:10.960
I will do the old pretending to sleep

05:41:10.960 --> 05:41:13.920
and then I'll open up the game again, okay?

05:41:13.920 --> 05:41:15.360
So don't worry.

05:41:15.360 --> 05:41:17.400
Don't worry about it.

05:41:17.400 --> 05:41:18.560
Eesh.

05:41:18.560 --> 05:41:19.400
Eesh.

05:41:20.760 --> 05:41:21.880
It caused my eyes.

05:41:24.400 --> 05:41:25.360
Eesh.

05:41:54.400 --> 05:41:55.240
Eesh.

05:42:24.400 --> 05:42:25.240
Eesh.

05:42:54.400 --> 05:42:55.240
Eesh.

05:43:24.400 --> 05:43:25.240
Eesh.

05:43:54.400 --> 05:43:55.240
Eesh.

05:44:24.400 --> 05:44:25.240
Eesh.

05:44:54.400 --> 05:44:55.240
Eesh.

05:45:24.400 --> 05:45:25.240
Eesh.

05:45:54.400 --> 05:45:55.240
Eesh.

05:46:24.400 --> 05:46:25.240
Eesh.

05:46:54.400 --> 05:46:55.240
Eesh.

05:47:24.400 --> 05:47:25.240
Eesh.

05:47:54.400 --> 05:47:55.240
Eesh.

05:48:24.400 --> 05:48:25.240
Eesh.

05:48:54.400 --> 05:48:55.240
Eesh.

05:49:16.240 --> 05:49:17.080
Oh.

05:49:19.480 --> 05:49:20.760
I had no idea I left eights.

05:49:20.760 --> 05:49:21.760
He was sitting like that.

05:49:21.760 --> 05:49:22.760
That was crazy.

05:49:23.720 --> 05:49:26.680
I was like, oh, we already had a recruits come back as well.

05:49:27.800 --> 05:49:29.120
Okay.

05:49:29.120 --> 05:49:32.160
I've got me, I've got all my food.

05:49:32.160 --> 05:49:37.160
I have a bowl and it has race pea snacks.

05:49:37.400 --> 05:49:42.400
It has two stick meat and one, eight and two egg.

05:49:45.120 --> 05:49:46.720
I'm just gonna send this assassin away

05:49:46.720 --> 05:49:49.000
to get like even more stronger.

05:49:49.720 --> 05:49:53.720
Because we're cained again to that heart.

05:49:53.720 --> 05:49:54.560
Jesus.

05:49:54.560 --> 05:49:55.400
Is there any level three?

05:49:55.400 --> 05:49:56.240
This is my goodness.

05:49:56.240 --> 05:49:57.960
That took a while to find.

05:49:57.960 --> 05:50:01.480
Oh, she went, oh, how long are they?

05:50:03.040 --> 05:50:04.320
Yeah.

05:50:04.320 --> 05:50:06.120
I'm like absolutely feasting.

05:50:06.120 --> 05:50:08.440
I've got fruit juice with me.

05:50:08.440 --> 05:50:10.720
I've got a bottle of water.

05:50:10.720 --> 05:50:13.960
I've got a cup of tea with honey in it.

05:50:13.960 --> 05:50:17.640
Like, oh, oh, not again.

05:50:17.640 --> 05:50:20.040
I say, oh, would you stop doing that?

05:50:20.040 --> 05:50:21.600
You're embarrassing me.

05:50:22.520 --> 05:50:24.560
We're driving this controller.

05:50:27.920 --> 05:50:29.920
So I'm gonna like munch and play,

05:50:29.920 --> 05:50:31.320
but I didn't bring any napkins.

05:50:31.320 --> 05:50:33.960
So I might have to suck the egg out of the bowl,

05:50:33.960 --> 05:50:38.960
which sounds bizarre, but can you say the second drink again?

05:50:39.640 --> 05:50:40.960
The fruit juice?

05:50:40.960 --> 05:50:42.840
It's like, it's got mango in it.

05:50:42.840 --> 05:50:44.520
It's like super healthy juice.

05:50:46.520 --> 05:50:48.040
And a cup of tea.

05:50:50.040 --> 05:50:51.520
Wait, you can't, what?

05:50:53.080 --> 05:50:54.520
What, a bottle of water?

05:50:54.520 --> 05:50:55.520
Oh, a bottle of water.

05:50:55.520 --> 05:50:58.840
I didn't say it like the British say it, well,

05:50:58.840 --> 05:51:01.440
I consider the British, the English,

05:51:01.440 --> 05:51:03.480
and the memes like kind of about the English say

05:51:03.480 --> 05:51:04.760
the bottle of water.

05:51:05.920 --> 05:51:07.960
I'm like, oh, I don't know what I'm saying.

05:51:08.960 --> 05:51:11.040
I don't know if I need to slurp this egg

05:51:11.040 --> 05:51:13.760
because I really can't be bothered getting,

05:51:13.760 --> 05:51:14.760
where am I supposed to be going?

05:51:14.760 --> 05:51:16.280
How far away is this location?

05:51:19.840 --> 05:51:21.920
Oh, it's the castle, right?

05:51:21.920 --> 05:51:24.560
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna get rid of this.

05:51:24.560 --> 05:51:26.440
Oh, it says he's a coward though.

05:51:29.000 --> 05:51:31.280
It's really annoying trying to get cowards

05:51:31.280 --> 05:51:33.120
because they actually run away.

05:51:35.520 --> 05:51:37.000
Actually, give me one second.

05:51:37.040 --> 05:51:39.760
My room is on fire because of this PC.

05:51:40.920 --> 05:51:42.440
Literally getting baked.

05:51:54.200 --> 05:51:55.400
Oh, I've been robbed!

05:51:55.400 --> 05:51:58.520
I've looked away for five seconds and I've been robbed!

05:51:58.520 --> 05:52:00.720
Oh, right, I didn't need the money that much.

05:52:01.800 --> 05:52:02.680
It's fine, it's fine, great.

05:52:02.680 --> 05:52:03.640
Let me put my headset on.

05:52:03.640 --> 05:52:06.000
That actually can't hear the gear right now.

05:52:06.000 --> 05:52:08.480
Did he just run up to me and like rob me?

05:52:18.040 --> 05:52:19.800
Not seeing my room's hope,

05:52:19.800 --> 05:52:21.440
but too hope it's just came in through a ring

05:52:21.440 --> 05:52:24.680
and honestly, I'm sweltering.

05:52:24.680 --> 05:52:26.800
I don't know if that's the Scottish word, sweltering.

05:52:26.800 --> 05:52:27.640
Do you see that?

05:52:27.640 --> 05:52:28.480
I'm sweltering.

05:52:29.960 --> 05:52:31.320
Sweating my beets off.

05:52:32.200 --> 05:52:36.160
Although I feel like sweating my beets off

05:52:36.160 --> 05:52:39.640
probably comes from like, is it Mardi Gras?

05:52:39.640 --> 05:52:41.720
Like that party that Americans have

05:52:41.720 --> 05:52:46.720
where you unveil yourself and you get beets as a reward.

05:52:47.440 --> 05:52:49.840
Like I think that's where that saying might've came from

05:52:49.840 --> 05:52:50.680
because that just makes sense.

05:52:50.680 --> 05:52:52.000
Like, oh, I'm sweating my beets off

05:52:52.000 --> 05:52:56.360
because I'm like showing the goods so much and so often.

05:52:57.360 --> 05:53:02.360
Right, where on earth has this got this captain?

05:53:04.360 --> 05:53:05.840
I really don't want to mess it up

05:53:05.840 --> 05:53:09.600
because if you mess it up and he runs away in time,

05:53:09.600 --> 05:53:13.520
you have to wait until the following day.

05:53:13.520 --> 05:53:16.160
Oh, I think I know who this one is.

05:53:16.160 --> 05:53:19.360
I think he, oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

05:53:19.360 --> 05:53:22.840
No, see, oh, you know the guy that can see you right now?

05:53:22.840 --> 05:53:26.720
I could actually, wait, I can't lock onto him,

05:53:26.720 --> 05:53:27.880
but he can lock onto me.

05:53:27.880 --> 05:53:30.320
See you stinky AI, perish.

05:53:33.200 --> 05:53:35.240
Oh, beets of sweat that come off your head.

05:53:35.240 --> 05:53:38.240
Ooh, you know what?

05:53:39.640 --> 05:53:41.760
Yeah, I know that you said that, that makes more sense.

05:53:41.760 --> 05:53:45.760
Yeah, probably not Mardi Gras really is.

05:53:45.760 --> 05:53:48.280
Okay, I'll pay it, I'm safe.

05:53:48.280 --> 05:53:51.240
Where's, yes, I knew it was this one.

05:53:53.720 --> 05:53:57.200
Do we assassinate him from above, is my question?

05:53:58.200 --> 05:53:59.560
I don't know.

05:54:01.000 --> 05:54:03.800
I normally have three signals at this point,

05:54:03.800 --> 05:54:06.000
which means I can do a raining down effect.

05:54:07.000 --> 05:54:09.440
Did he really say where did I go?

05:54:09.440 --> 05:54:10.280
Gryff.

05:54:11.320 --> 05:54:14.200
Right, if I can air assassinate him,

05:54:14.200 --> 05:54:16.880
this isn't a problem.

05:54:16.880 --> 05:54:19.480
If I can lock onto him, I am very tall

05:54:19.480 --> 05:54:21.160
up to lock onto him though.

05:54:23.840 --> 05:54:27.520
No, wait, no, wait, lock onto him.

05:54:27.520 --> 05:54:29.600
Yeah, uh-huh.

05:54:31.160 --> 05:54:36.160
No, yes, yes, yes, oh, that was so good.

05:54:38.960 --> 05:54:42.000
Oh, and none of the guards want to defend, that's hilarious.

05:54:43.400 --> 05:54:48.240
All the guards are like, that man just came out of the sky.

05:54:48.240 --> 05:54:51.400
We are not, we are retreating right now.

05:54:53.680 --> 05:54:56.720
Does your room have poor ventilation?

05:54:56.720 --> 05:54:58.280
That's horrendous ventilation.

05:55:01.000 --> 05:55:02.840
Unfortunately, I'm renting,

05:55:04.280 --> 05:55:07.120
so I have like absolutely no input

05:55:07.120 --> 05:55:09.760
or like anything I could really do about it.

05:55:09.760 --> 05:55:11.200
Rip in pepperoni.

05:55:15.720 --> 05:55:18.280
He craves the drop, true.

05:55:18.280 --> 05:55:20.560
Okay, I shouldn't get too distracted

05:55:20.560 --> 05:55:22.520
because my tea's gonna get too cold

05:55:22.520 --> 05:55:25.240
and my fruit juice is gonna get too warm.

05:55:26.640 --> 05:55:29.880
I am going to ignite the,

05:55:29.880 --> 05:55:33.520
gotta light this place up and then we're gone, oh.

05:55:37.720 --> 05:55:40.800
You're edging me and not the good kind.

05:55:44.360 --> 05:55:45.480
Are the windows open?

05:55:45.480 --> 05:55:47.760
No, the window's freaking broken.

05:55:47.920 --> 05:55:52.760
Um, like the landlord is being really nice to me

05:55:52.760 --> 05:55:54.320
and he's like left me alone.

05:55:54.320 --> 05:55:56.080
It's not like one of them annoying landlords

05:55:56.080 --> 05:55:58.960
that are like trying to like trail through your place

05:55:58.960 --> 05:56:03.960
all the time, but obviously whenever you visit somewhere

05:56:04.000 --> 05:56:07.240
to rent and you like inspect it,

05:56:07.240 --> 05:56:09.680
you don't actually know what's wrong with the place

05:56:09.680 --> 05:56:13.520
until you move in and like they're obviously,

05:56:13.520 --> 05:56:17.080
I discovered like windows are broken,

05:56:17.080 --> 05:56:20.920
the hot and like cold, I don't know what the word is,

05:56:22.120 --> 05:56:23.840
is not like ideal.

05:56:23.840 --> 05:56:25.720
Are you guys okay if I hide in this hay bale?

05:56:25.720 --> 05:56:29.720
We'll start drink my, oh, I forgot to shake my fruit juice.

05:56:29.720 --> 05:56:32.400
Whoops, that's like real one of having fruit juice.

05:56:32.400 --> 05:56:34.800
Um, I might just drink it real quick.

05:56:34.800 --> 05:56:35.720
I apologize.

05:56:43.840 --> 05:56:45.320
Oh, that shit's so good.

05:56:46.480 --> 05:56:48.520
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

05:56:48.520 --> 05:56:52.320
It's apple, banana, lychee, mango, just smoothie.

05:56:52.320 --> 05:56:54.640
So I'm getting all my fruit in one drink

05:56:54.640 --> 05:56:59.080
because I don't really eat fruit that often.

05:56:59.080 --> 05:57:01.160
I like waste fruit, so I feel bad.

05:57:02.080 --> 05:57:04.120
Oh my God, it's mimosa, mimosa spotted.

05:57:04.120 --> 05:57:04.960
Uh-huh.

05:57:12.880 --> 05:57:14.800
Guys, you'll never guess who I arranged

05:57:14.800 --> 05:57:16.720
an ASMR collab with this morning.

05:57:17.800 --> 05:57:19.520
They've just showed up in chat.

05:57:24.800 --> 05:57:26.880
It's very likely.

05:57:26.880 --> 05:57:30.120
That'll be my first official collab with a VTuber.

05:57:31.640 --> 05:57:33.560
Got Dimp on the list.

05:57:33.560 --> 05:57:35.800
I'm hunting down everyone with radios.

05:57:35.800 --> 05:57:38.720
I'm serious about that goal.

05:57:38.720 --> 05:57:41.200
I'm arranging them all, we'll make it nice and easy.

05:57:41.200 --> 05:57:44.320
Gonna be doing my best, so hopefully you guys eat good

05:57:44.320 --> 05:57:48.720
and you can sleep to my soothing Scottish accent.

05:57:48.720 --> 05:57:50.720
That's right, wee laddie.

05:57:50.720 --> 05:57:52.920
Time to go to sleep.

05:57:52.920 --> 05:57:54.480
Are you tingling?

05:57:54.480 --> 05:57:56.440
Tingle, tingle, tingle.

05:58:00.600 --> 05:58:02.720
Oh my God, she must be so cool to be able to collab with you.

05:58:02.960 --> 05:58:03.800
Ha ha ha ha.

05:58:06.440 --> 05:58:09.640
I should actually do like four Scots accent

05:58:09.640 --> 05:58:11.440
on an ASMR, that would be hilarious.

05:58:14.240 --> 05:58:16.680
I've almost finished my Juicy Just hypotenuse.

05:58:19.800 --> 05:58:20.800
What should I eat first?

05:58:20.800 --> 05:58:21.640
Should I eat an egg?

05:58:21.640 --> 05:58:22.480
I think so.

05:58:24.360 --> 05:58:27.880
I don't really like the idea of eggs sitting out too long.

05:58:27.880 --> 05:58:30.040
Oh, what the fuck?

05:58:30.120 --> 05:58:32.840
To say something was delicious in Scots,

05:58:32.840 --> 05:58:35.760
you say it was braw, and that was braw.

05:58:35.760 --> 05:58:37.520
That drink was delicious.

05:58:40.320 --> 05:58:42.600
You keep mocking your accent.

05:58:42.600 --> 05:58:45.320
Oh, I don't think people find the Scottish accent hot.

05:58:45.320 --> 05:58:47.200
I would say like hot accents,

05:58:47.200 --> 05:58:50.360
like unironically like French Italian

05:58:50.360 --> 05:58:52.360
or normally like rated quite highly.

05:58:53.600 --> 05:58:55.360
I have taken a bite of a meat stick.

05:58:55.360 --> 05:58:58.480
I apologize for anyone who doesn't like eating.

05:58:58.480 --> 05:58:59.320
I need to eat.

05:59:02.560 --> 05:59:06.200
I want you to read Go The Eft Sleep and Your Accent.

05:59:06.200 --> 05:59:07.040
That'd be good.

05:59:10.600 --> 05:59:13.280
Is Valley Girl strongy real?

05:59:13.280 --> 05:59:14.120
Hi, guys.

05:59:16.320 --> 05:59:19.560
I'm so totally excited to be here.

05:59:20.760 --> 05:59:24.680
Yeah, I'm Valley Girl, I laugh at everything.

05:59:26.120 --> 05:59:27.720
Yeah, that's the best you can.

05:59:28.720 --> 05:59:29.560
Yeah, you like that?

05:59:29.560 --> 05:59:30.880
Is that what you want?

05:59:31.920 --> 05:59:32.760
I'm scared.

05:59:34.840 --> 05:59:36.440
I want to perish.

05:59:37.360 --> 05:59:39.440
Valley Girl's strongy, say in it, brav.

05:59:40.480 --> 05:59:42.520
Can you do a Scottish Valley Girl?

05:59:46.120 --> 05:59:48.000
No, I don't think so.

05:59:50.800 --> 05:59:53.360
No, I don't think so.

05:59:53.360 --> 05:59:54.600
I didn't think so.

05:59:54.600 --> 05:59:58.400
No, my brain is like unable to compute what I need to do

05:59:58.400 --> 06:00:02.440
in order to keep the accent, but make it different.

06:00:03.560 --> 06:00:04.400
Brain kind of it.

06:00:06.440 --> 06:00:09.840
You're not hypnotizing us Scottish accents at all.

06:00:11.960 --> 06:00:13.080
I'm eating the meat.

06:00:13.080 --> 06:00:15.000
I am now baiting the egg.

06:00:15.000 --> 06:00:16.080
I'm just going to touch it.

06:00:20.800 --> 06:00:22.520
I just said fucking delicious.

06:00:24.560 --> 06:00:27.120
I have erned, oh my God.

06:00:27.120 --> 06:00:29.200
A bite of the egg and the meat at the same time.

06:00:29.200 --> 06:00:30.400
I have earned this, okay?

06:00:30.400 --> 06:00:31.320
I have earned this.

06:00:31.320 --> 06:00:32.160
Ah.

06:00:38.560 --> 06:00:39.960
Is I almost choking on it?

06:00:39.960 --> 06:00:42.160
Hey, ho, there's a first time for everything.

06:00:45.240 --> 06:00:47.520
It's like a pepper ramy if you're a British.

06:00:47.520 --> 06:00:49.840
I don't know what the equivalent is in America

06:00:49.840 --> 06:00:52.760
or it's a twizy stick in Australia.

06:00:54.040 --> 06:00:56.160
Xio is literally, he's like, I need to rest.

06:00:56.200 --> 06:00:57.480
I'll be not at this for hours.

06:00:57.480 --> 06:00:59.480
He's sleeping in the hay.

06:01:05.800 --> 06:01:08.560
Oh, my mouth opens when my mouth.

06:01:11.320 --> 06:01:13.160
Ah, that's cool.

06:01:17.000 --> 06:01:19.040
Like my mouth is closed right now,

06:01:19.040 --> 06:01:24.040
but because my mouth opens, well, yeah.

06:01:24.880 --> 06:01:26.200
Ba, ba, ba, ba.

06:01:26.200 --> 06:01:27.040
Sorry, sorry.

06:01:30.160 --> 06:01:32.360
A slim gym, probably.

06:01:41.640 --> 06:01:46.640
Would you like some sweet chili pea snack

06:01:47.880 --> 06:01:49.120
that's been baked?

06:01:54.120 --> 06:01:54.960
Ow.

06:02:06.280 --> 06:02:07.440
Okay, open up.

06:02:13.640 --> 06:02:15.680
I hope you guys stretched.

06:02:17.440 --> 06:02:18.680
Because if you haven't stretched,

06:02:18.680 --> 06:02:21.800
that's you sat for six hours and you're supposed to stretch.

06:02:22.800 --> 06:02:24.120
If anyone's in a wheelchair,

06:02:24.120 --> 06:02:26.080
you're exempt from these instructions.

06:02:37.080 --> 06:02:39.800
I stretched all my limbs, this is good.

06:02:42.480 --> 06:02:44.200
You're not going to fall for that one stare.

06:02:44.200 --> 06:02:46.480
Well, you're going to split, aren't you?

06:02:46.480 --> 06:02:47.800
Ah, stare.

06:02:48.640 --> 06:02:53.240
Oh, my God, I don't know if I can read that out.

06:02:55.560 --> 06:02:57.240
When is booty inspection day?

06:03:01.440 --> 06:03:04.720
A faint sound of munching emanates from the car.

06:03:04.720 --> 06:03:05.720
Hum, hum, hum, hum.

06:03:08.160 --> 06:03:13.160
I've got sweet chili pea snacks that are baked.

06:03:14.000 --> 06:03:16.920
Two meat sticks and two eggs,

06:03:16.920 --> 06:03:19.000
and I've got one meat and egg left,

06:03:19.000 --> 06:03:20.760
and I'm just munching on the peas.

06:03:25.680 --> 06:03:26.840
Oh, my God.

06:03:27.880 --> 06:03:31.360
So for years, I had no idea what Charlie Horse meant.

06:03:35.480 --> 06:03:37.600
It's just called a pulled muscle.

06:03:38.440 --> 06:03:43.440
And I was like, what on earth is a Charlie Horse?

06:03:43.440 --> 06:03:46.520
Like, is this a famous horse named Charlie?

06:03:46.520 --> 06:03:48.120
Why is it happening to people?

06:03:48.120 --> 06:03:50.000
That's not possible.

06:03:50.000 --> 06:03:52.360
I was like, it's crazy.

06:03:52.360 --> 06:03:53.640
And then I finally figured it out

06:03:53.640 --> 06:03:57.680
because I watched a meme and the guy fell over

06:03:57.680 --> 06:04:00.600
and he was like, ah, ah, Charlie Horse.

06:04:00.600 --> 06:04:02.440
And because of his body language,

06:04:02.440 --> 06:04:04.520
my brain was like, oh, my God,

06:04:04.520 --> 06:04:06.680
he's having a muscle spasm.

06:04:06.720 --> 06:04:08.280
That's what it means.

06:04:09.280 --> 06:04:12.360
Like, oh, I need a burp.

06:04:12.360 --> 06:04:14.520
I'm so sorry, I'm eating, so it means a burp a lot.

06:04:14.520 --> 06:04:16.600
I'm jammy, if you don't like it.

06:04:20.720 --> 06:04:24.400
I don't think a zero or a mercy burp.

06:04:24.400 --> 06:04:25.840
I think they have manners

06:04:25.840 --> 06:04:28.480
and weren't raised in a barn like me.

06:04:29.480 --> 06:04:30.480
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

06:04:36.040 --> 06:04:38.840
I was named after Sir Charles of Horse.

06:04:41.840 --> 06:04:43.320
Ooh, money.

06:04:43.320 --> 06:04:45.280
We've got 3,000 in the bank right now.

06:04:47.360 --> 06:04:50.160
Some say that Charlie's still in pain to this day.

06:04:51.080 --> 06:04:52.400
Was that a meme on Family Guy?

06:04:52.400 --> 06:04:53.800
I don't know what it was.

06:04:53.800 --> 06:04:56.720
No, those ones are the difference.

06:04:56.720 --> 06:04:58.080
I learned from Mercy the other day

06:04:58.080 --> 06:04:59.680
that saying be there, be square

06:04:59.680 --> 06:05:01.160
is because you won't be around.

06:05:03.120 --> 06:05:03.960
Wait, what?

06:05:05.000 --> 06:05:09.200
Be there or be square is because you won't be around.

06:05:10.880 --> 06:05:15.680
Oh, that's so smart.

06:05:15.680 --> 06:05:20.560
Like, around in a circle, yeah?

06:05:20.560 --> 06:05:22.640
And like, you won't be around in the area

06:05:22.640 --> 06:05:25.000
if you're not there, because you're a square.

06:05:26.040 --> 06:05:27.960
Yeah, oh, I just got that too.

06:05:27.960 --> 06:05:29.560
That's good, I like that.

06:05:29.560 --> 06:05:31.320
Mercy smart.

06:05:31.320 --> 06:05:33.440
Shawnee, it's not manners, it's your cuttlebone.

06:05:33.440 --> 06:05:34.960
You're just in to boil and say,

06:05:34.960 --> 06:05:36.920
yes, this is my first time on land.

06:05:37.760 --> 06:05:38.800
Sometimes.

06:05:40.760 --> 06:05:41.760
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:05:47.440 --> 06:05:49.240
Careful, you don't want to make me too smart.

06:05:49.240 --> 06:05:51.760
I'll start coming up when you names Fond de la Buse...

06:05:52.720 --> 06:05:54.640
I'm never gonna live down Fond de la Buse

06:05:54.640 --> 06:05:55.480
when we sucky.

06:05:58.720 --> 06:06:01.880
What marshmallow did you want to see Anthony spit at that?

06:06:01.880 --> 06:06:03.080
Oh, I didn't open up the marshmallows.

06:06:03.080 --> 06:06:04.840
Well, we do it at the end of stream,

06:06:04.840 --> 06:06:06.000
because we're actually really close

06:06:06.000 --> 06:06:08.040
to finishing the game, like, really close.

06:06:10.160 --> 06:06:11.000
Mm-hmm.

06:06:14.200 --> 06:06:15.040
Mm-hmm.

06:06:16.960 --> 06:06:19.480
Alright, you better be scared of me cooking again.

06:06:24.120 --> 06:06:25.120
Yum-yum-yum-yum.

06:06:27.960 --> 06:06:28.800
Mm-hmm.

06:06:36.960 --> 06:06:37.800
Mm-hmm.

06:06:39.840 --> 06:06:42.920
Uh, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna suck my fingers.

06:06:42.920 --> 06:06:44.120
I know some people don't like it,

06:06:44.120 --> 06:06:46.360
matter-wise, but I don't have an napkin.

06:06:46.360 --> 06:06:47.200
Eh.

06:06:48.920 --> 06:06:49.760
Eh.

06:06:50.800 --> 06:06:52.720
That reminds me, I need to make the audio.

06:06:52.720 --> 06:06:54.040
Eh.

06:06:54.040 --> 06:06:54.880
Mm-hmm.

06:06:56.720 --> 06:06:57.560
Mm-hmm.

06:06:58.960 --> 06:06:59.800
Mm-hmm.

06:06:59.800 --> 06:07:00.920
Okay.

06:07:00.920 --> 06:07:03.000
I inhaled the meat and the egg,

06:07:03.000 --> 06:07:04.080
and then I finished my tea,

06:07:04.080 --> 06:07:05.080
and then we're gonna get straight back

06:07:05.080 --> 06:07:05.920
and finish this stuff.

06:07:05.920 --> 06:07:06.760
Ah.

06:07:09.200 --> 06:07:10.040
Mm-hmm.

06:07:11.960 --> 06:07:13.600
Yum-yum-yum.

06:07:13.600 --> 06:07:15.360
This is a really good combo.

06:07:16.480 --> 06:07:19.480
I need to, like, more charcuterie snack stuff

06:07:19.480 --> 06:07:21.480
for longer streams,

06:07:21.480 --> 06:07:23.840
because I don't have time to actually make food.

06:07:25.320 --> 06:07:26.160
Mm-hmm.

06:07:28.960 --> 06:07:33.960
Maybe in a cold pasta dish,

06:07:34.000 --> 06:07:35.200
I can pre-make.

06:07:36.720 --> 06:07:39.560
The crunchy thing is the meat stick.

06:07:39.560 --> 06:07:41.960
It's got, like, a skin on it, eh.

06:07:41.960 --> 06:07:44.200
I don't know, mm-hmm.

06:07:44.200 --> 06:07:45.040
That's the meat.

06:07:48.080 --> 06:07:48.920
Mm-hmm.

06:07:53.480 --> 06:07:57.560
I've got protein from the egg,

06:07:57.560 --> 06:08:00.680
and protein from the meat and fats,

06:08:01.720 --> 06:08:04.320
and the pea snacks are carbohydrates.

06:08:06.000 --> 06:08:07.000
Ah.

06:08:07.000 --> 06:08:07.840
Ah.

06:08:12.520 --> 06:08:13.520
Yum-yum-yum.

06:08:13.520 --> 06:08:15.240
I'm gonna get tons of hydration.

06:08:17.440 --> 06:08:19.920
That's way too crunchy to be, it is meat!

06:08:20.920 --> 06:08:22.760
It is meat, I promise you, it's meat.

06:08:22.760 --> 06:08:25.320
It's, like, an outer skin, like a pepper ramy.

06:08:27.840 --> 06:08:30.720
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:08:30.720 --> 06:08:32.480
Okay, all the food is finished.

06:08:32.480 --> 06:08:33.320
Yippee!

06:08:34.520 --> 06:08:36.440
I'm now for the tea.

06:08:36.440 --> 06:08:37.280
Ah.

06:08:39.080 --> 06:08:39.920
Um.

06:08:41.280 --> 06:08:42.240
Honestly,

06:08:43.960 --> 06:08:45.880
depending on how fast we go,

06:08:45.880 --> 06:08:49.360
we might actually finish the campaign in less than two hours,

06:08:49.360 --> 06:08:51.120
but I'm quite happy to, like, fart about

06:08:51.120 --> 06:08:54.440
and do the Borgia Towers after, maybe, like,

06:08:54.440 --> 06:08:56.000
so we can, like, streamline tomorrow

06:08:56.000 --> 06:08:58.280
for doing the DNA sequence run.

06:09:01.200 --> 06:09:02.040
Mm.

06:09:06.320 --> 06:09:07.880
Ah.

06:09:07.880 --> 06:09:09.960
I'm gonna let a big burp, I'm sorry.

06:09:11.720 --> 06:09:13.880
Oh, that was good.

06:09:13.880 --> 06:09:15.400
That was such good food.

06:09:15.400 --> 06:09:17.640
I really needed that, and I hit the spot.

06:09:20.560 --> 06:09:23.240
A battered Mars four-hand count stream.

06:09:23.240 --> 06:09:24.640
It's a honey tea.

06:09:26.000 --> 06:09:26.840
I'm sorry.

06:09:26.840 --> 06:09:29.920
It all comes back up, I've got you.

06:09:29.920 --> 06:09:33.440
I was gonna record Isomar, like, your girlfriend

06:09:33.440 --> 06:09:35.160
for, like, forgets to turn off the mic,

06:09:35.160 --> 06:09:36.880
so it was just me munching and crunching,

06:09:36.880 --> 06:09:38.800
because some people, like, really enjoy,

06:09:38.800 --> 06:09:41.080
like, other people's, like, munching sounds.

06:09:41.080 --> 06:09:43.480
I'm, like, if you are telling me

06:09:43.480 --> 06:09:45.720
that I can order McDonald's

06:09:47.120 --> 06:09:49.000
and eat it on the mic,

06:09:49.000 --> 06:09:51.800
and people would, like, be happy with that,

06:09:51.800 --> 06:09:54.320
like, uh, you don't gotta tell me twice.

06:09:54.520 --> 06:09:55.360
Oh.

06:09:56.840 --> 06:09:57.960
Shawnee, if you're looking for a snack

06:09:57.960 --> 06:10:00.560
that's easy to prepare, grapes.

06:10:00.560 --> 06:10:01.880
I can't believe it.

06:10:01.880 --> 06:10:05.800
I can't believe you're telling me to eat healthy

06:10:05.800 --> 06:10:07.880
and look after myself.

06:10:07.880 --> 06:10:08.720
Oh.

06:10:10.400 --> 06:10:12.000
Cruel world.

06:10:12.000 --> 06:10:13.960
Honey tea, you boil those per beat?

06:10:13.960 --> 06:10:15.800
No!

06:10:15.800 --> 06:10:17.360
I love the bees.

06:10:17.360 --> 06:10:20.880
I get to, um, buy my honey from, like,

06:10:21.880 --> 06:10:23.320
a, like, smaller shop,

06:10:23.320 --> 06:10:26.680
and I like supporting them on their own, like.

06:10:26.680 --> 06:10:27.840
Right, I sip my tea.

06:10:29.680 --> 06:10:31.560
Oh, yeah, I can't, that was roasting.

06:10:31.560 --> 06:10:33.560
It's still quite warm, not gonna lie.

06:10:33.560 --> 06:10:35.040
I thought it was gonna cool.

06:10:35.040 --> 06:10:36.040
Be a bit cooler.

06:10:36.040 --> 06:10:36.880
Uh.

06:10:39.320 --> 06:10:40.920
I'm okay, I'm okay, though.

06:10:40.920 --> 06:10:44.480
Right, we're gonna go and get our wand taken off of us.

06:10:46.880 --> 06:10:49.120
Right, we'll put that on the Herald.

06:10:49.120 --> 06:10:50.720
Thank you very much.

06:10:51.720 --> 06:10:52.560
Yuck.

06:10:53.680 --> 06:10:56.080
You're about to stand in some serious meta.

06:10:58.480 --> 06:10:59.800
Chicken nuggets ASMR.

06:10:59.800 --> 06:11:00.640
Ooh.

06:11:02.960 --> 06:11:06.280
Is 100, does eating 100 chicken nuggets still a challenge?

06:11:07.720 --> 06:11:09.760
I feel like you starve me

06:11:09.760 --> 06:11:12.920
and I could probably do that, like, in one go.

06:11:16.440 --> 06:11:18.480
Have I bought this bank over here?

06:11:18.480 --> 06:11:20.160
I haven't!

06:11:20.160 --> 06:11:22.240
Investments, people, investments.

06:11:24.400 --> 06:11:25.720
That reminds me several years ago,

06:11:25.720 --> 06:11:28.960
back when Tumblr was an important platform

06:11:28.960 --> 06:11:30.760
that some vegans actually thought bees

06:11:30.760 --> 06:11:33.000
were physical harm for their honey.

06:11:33.000 --> 06:11:33.840
Oh.

06:11:33.840 --> 06:11:34.680
I mean.

06:11:36.320 --> 06:11:39.520
Um, vegans just doing their thing, it's fine.

06:11:39.520 --> 06:11:41.920
They're nice, I guess.

06:11:43.320 --> 06:11:45.120
I just, yeah.

06:11:45.120 --> 06:11:45.960
Vegans are vegans.

06:11:46.680 --> 06:11:49.840
I completely understand, like, the stance,

06:11:49.840 --> 06:11:52.000
like, no one actually wants any animals

06:11:52.000 --> 06:11:54.080
to be hurt or all that jazz.

06:11:54.080 --> 06:11:57.720
I just, you know, I ask,

06:11:57.720 --> 06:11:59.840
have you ever seen a healthy-looking vegan

06:11:59.840 --> 06:12:02.600
when they're like, I've been vegan for five years?

06:12:02.600 --> 06:12:04.120
They look ill.

06:12:04.120 --> 06:12:05.880
I had a close family member

06:12:05.880 --> 06:12:10.120
that was temporarily vegan for a couple of years.

06:12:10.120 --> 06:12:14.520
And when they finally started to eat, meet again,

06:12:14.600 --> 06:12:16.560
they were, like, healthy overnight.

06:12:16.560 --> 06:12:17.640
I'm so sorry.

06:12:17.640 --> 06:12:19.200
I apologize if anyone is a vegan here,

06:12:19.200 --> 06:12:21.760
but please seriously take your supplements,

06:12:21.760 --> 06:12:23.000
look at what you need to,

06:12:23.000 --> 06:12:24.240
in order to get what you need,

06:12:24.240 --> 06:12:26.960
because please, please be careful.

06:12:26.960 --> 06:12:28.120
It's very dangerous.

06:12:28.120 --> 06:12:31.080
I don't, I'm actually being serious for, like,

06:12:31.080 --> 06:12:33.080
for one millisecond.

06:12:33.080 --> 06:12:34.400
It is incredibly dangerous

06:12:34.400 --> 06:12:36.640
to genuinely choose to be a vegan.

06:12:36.640 --> 06:12:40.360
And a lot of people don't realize, until it's too late,

06:12:40.360 --> 06:12:42.600
that, like, you are,

06:12:45.360 --> 06:12:48.720
like, if you really want to get into it,

06:12:48.720 --> 06:12:50.840
like, there's the caveman times

06:12:50.840 --> 06:12:52.640
before we discovered what cooking,

06:12:52.640 --> 06:12:54.720
what cooked meat could do for us.

06:12:54.720 --> 06:12:56.720
And, like, it's like, you know,

06:12:56.720 --> 06:13:00.000
once humans had access to cooked meat,

06:13:00.000 --> 06:13:02.520
the brain power of humans, like, went up.

06:13:02.520 --> 06:13:04.360
I can't remember what all the details

06:13:04.360 --> 06:13:05.640
and what it's called and all that,

06:13:05.640 --> 06:13:07.400
but, like, this is what I've been taught,

06:13:07.400 --> 06:13:08.840
and, like, I genuinely believe it.

06:13:08.840 --> 06:13:10.640
I'm sorry, but if you've ever looked at vegan,

06:13:10.640 --> 06:13:12.720
they just look like a husk of a human.

06:13:12.720 --> 06:13:15.520
And I'm so sorry if it's offensively.

06:13:15.520 --> 06:13:17.600
It's just my opinion, but I never said I was smart.

06:13:17.600 --> 06:13:19.320
And my opinions don't reflect the agency.

06:13:19.320 --> 06:13:21.080
I'm sorry, love you, bye.

06:13:21.080 --> 06:13:22.840
I'll stop talking.

06:13:22.840 --> 06:13:23.800
I'll stop talking.

06:13:23.800 --> 06:13:26.240
Okay, this, uh, Borgia district,

06:13:26.240 --> 06:13:28.360
you have to scale it from the rooftops.

06:13:28.360 --> 06:13:29.680
It is impossible.

06:13:29.680 --> 06:13:31.920
You have to do it via AroStorm.

06:13:33.320 --> 06:13:35.360
If you do not do it via AroStorm,

06:13:35.360 --> 06:13:37.520
you're just, like, hurting yourself.

06:13:37.520 --> 06:13:38.740
Like, it is so bad.

06:13:40.080 --> 06:13:42.320
And you can get a flag on the way, so.

06:13:43.160 --> 06:13:46.040
So, literally, drop down AroStorm instantly.

06:13:47.160 --> 06:13:48.320
And just let that done.

06:13:49.400 --> 06:13:50.480
Easiest.

06:13:50.480 --> 06:13:52.560
Literally, you don't even annoy any other guards

06:13:52.560 --> 06:13:53.600
that are in the vicinity.

06:13:53.600 --> 06:13:56.120
There is no one on the rooftops.

06:13:56.120 --> 06:13:58.560
As long as you have AroStorm unlocked,

06:13:58.560 --> 06:14:01.120
which is what the, um,

06:14:02.400 --> 06:14:04.000
which is what the three recruits,

06:14:04.000 --> 06:14:06.400
so you need six previous Borgia towers destroyed

06:14:06.400 --> 06:14:08.880
in order to get that, but once you've got it,

06:14:08.880 --> 06:14:12.000
then you're smooth sailing through the game.

06:14:13.640 --> 06:14:15.880
If only Leafs had protein.

06:14:15.880 --> 06:14:20.640
Yes, I know deeper green-colored veg tablels

06:14:20.640 --> 06:14:23.480
are, like, really, really good in general.

06:14:23.480 --> 06:14:25.040
What way am I to go?

06:14:25.040 --> 06:14:26.920
That looks too big for me to...

06:14:26.920 --> 06:14:28.320
Yeah, I don't have a glove yet.

06:14:28.320 --> 06:14:30.520
Okay, this looks like the way I need to go.

06:14:31.320 --> 06:14:33.480
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

06:14:35.040 --> 06:14:38.360
Did anyone get their, what was it?

06:14:38.360 --> 06:14:39.800
What's that organ that blows up

06:14:39.800 --> 06:14:41.720
that was used for grass eating?

06:14:41.760 --> 06:14:43.040
Like, it literally kills you.

06:14:43.040 --> 06:14:44.920
I'll always forget the name of it.

06:14:44.920 --> 06:14:46.000
An appendix?

06:14:46.000 --> 06:14:48.360
Did anyone get their appendixes removed?

06:14:49.600 --> 06:14:51.080
Ooh.

06:14:51.080 --> 06:14:53.880
Did you get wrecked with your appendix?

06:14:55.840 --> 06:14:57.080
Okay, tea time.

06:14:59.600 --> 06:15:01.560
Rice and beans.

06:15:01.560 --> 06:15:02.840
Can cover you for the most.

06:15:02.840 --> 06:15:03.680
Yeah.

06:15:07.440 --> 06:15:09.400
Yours burst?

06:15:10.320 --> 06:15:13.720
Oh, you must have been deathly ill.

06:15:13.720 --> 06:15:16.720
If it bursts, it can result in death,

06:15:16.720 --> 06:15:19.360
because it's just straight poison to your organs.

06:15:19.360 --> 06:15:20.640
Holy crap.

06:15:20.640 --> 06:15:22.880
Someone said my tonsils grew y-

06:15:22.880 --> 06:15:25.120
They stole your tonsils?

06:15:25.120 --> 06:15:26.640
Oh, give them back.

06:15:29.880 --> 06:15:31.760
I thought appendixes were forbill-

06:15:31.760 --> 06:15:32.600
I thought append-

06:15:32.600 --> 06:15:35.200
I got some appendixes was for when we used to eat,

06:15:35.200 --> 06:15:38.320
like, grass, grass, like, back in the old day.

06:15:38.360 --> 06:15:39.520
I'm taking a sip of tea.

06:15:39.520 --> 06:15:41.640
I'm gonna try and finish up my apology.

06:15:44.640 --> 06:15:45.800
Ah, your gallbladder?

06:15:45.800 --> 06:15:46.640
I'm scared.

06:15:46.640 --> 06:15:48.520
My mom had a gallbladder issue.

06:15:48.520 --> 06:15:50.040
And so did my gran.

06:15:50.040 --> 06:15:53.040
Genetically, I am predispositioned.

06:15:53.040 --> 06:15:54.320
Like, one day on stream,

06:15:54.320 --> 06:15:56.920
I'm just gonna start like screaming and being like,

06:15:56.920 --> 06:15:59.520
gallbladder, gallbladder!

06:16:00.480 --> 06:16:03.720
But, uh, hopefully that doesn't actually happen.

06:16:03.720 --> 06:16:06.200
But I can't say I'm the healthiest being around.

06:16:08.920 --> 06:16:10.160
You can die of death.

06:16:10.160 --> 06:16:12.080
Did I say that?

06:16:12.080 --> 06:16:13.080
You can die of death.

06:16:18.040 --> 06:16:19.600
I don't wish that pain.

06:16:19.600 --> 06:16:22.160
Wait, you know how you guys are guys?

06:16:23.160 --> 06:16:27.040
Have you guys ever passed the kidney stone?

06:16:28.800 --> 06:16:30.640
For anyone who drinks an energy drink,

06:16:30.640 --> 06:16:31.880
have you passed the kidney stone?

06:16:31.880 --> 06:16:33.000
Yes or no?

06:16:33.000 --> 06:16:34.320
I'm very interested in that.

06:16:34.320 --> 06:16:35.160
I wanna know.

06:16:36.000 --> 06:16:37.280
Never, maybe?

06:16:37.280 --> 06:16:39.760
Did you ever really sort of pee-pee at one time?

06:16:39.760 --> 06:16:42.160
We are not 100% what it is used for.

06:16:42.160 --> 06:16:44.240
These range from filtration,

06:16:44.240 --> 06:16:47.640
to breaking down fiber, to appendix, to a mystery organ.

06:16:47.640 --> 06:16:48.880
That's so cool!

06:16:48.880 --> 06:16:50.040
Like, how do we not know?

06:16:50.040 --> 06:16:51.680
We've got so much history.

06:16:51.680 --> 06:16:52.520
No.

06:16:55.080 --> 06:16:55.920
I hope I don't.

06:16:55.920 --> 06:16:56.760
Yeah, it sucks.

06:16:56.760 --> 06:16:57.600
Ooh!

06:17:00.400 --> 06:17:03.080
I've heard stories from Whammon.

06:17:03.440 --> 06:17:05.200
I've heard stories from Whammon

06:17:05.200 --> 06:17:06.760
that are like, I've had a kidney stone

06:17:06.760 --> 06:17:07.640
and I've had a baby.

06:17:07.640 --> 06:17:09.800
I'd rather, you know, do the baby again.

06:17:09.800 --> 06:17:11.880
And I'm like, hey, see?

06:17:11.880 --> 06:17:14.440
That's biology in play.

06:17:14.440 --> 06:17:19.440
Did you know the brain actually tells Whammon

06:17:19.440 --> 06:17:22.120
that they're birth of their...

06:17:22.120 --> 06:17:24.280
Wait, where the heck am I going?

06:17:24.280 --> 06:17:26.560
Can I climb up here without the glove?

06:17:26.560 --> 06:17:29.400
I don't think I can climb up here without the glove.

06:17:29.400 --> 06:17:30.240
Climb?

06:17:30.240 --> 06:17:31.240
No?

06:17:31.240 --> 06:17:32.160
Okay, I can, I can.

06:17:32.200 --> 06:17:33.040
Jesus.

06:17:33.040 --> 06:17:35.720
I was like, oh, I've just missed out.

06:17:35.720 --> 06:17:37.520
I love stronticolors and I heard,

06:17:37.520 --> 06:17:39.040
heart kidney stone perils!

06:17:39.040 --> 06:17:40.560
Oh my God!

06:17:40.560 --> 06:17:41.680
I do have peril.

06:17:41.680 --> 06:17:44.240
I have a peril in a very special location.

06:17:45.760 --> 06:17:47.040
Are you there, Mercy?

06:17:47.040 --> 06:17:48.680
Are you streaming later?

06:17:48.680 --> 06:17:52.040
Are you streaming in one hour, two hour?

06:17:52.960 --> 06:17:55.680
Three hour, Mercy stream, question mark.

06:17:58.400 --> 06:18:00.400
I'm finishing my team, please pardon me.

06:18:03.160 --> 06:18:05.160
I need a burp, it's like stuck in my throat.

06:18:10.160 --> 06:18:12.160
I have finished my team.

06:18:14.160 --> 06:18:15.160
Requiem.

06:18:16.160 --> 06:18:18.160
Requiem, cadavante.

06:18:18.160 --> 06:18:20.160
Okay, whee!

06:18:28.160 --> 06:18:29.160
It's Azura.

06:18:30.160 --> 06:18:32.160
Is Azura?

06:18:32.160 --> 06:18:34.160
Is Mama Azu streaming in the day?

06:18:34.160 --> 06:18:36.160
Wait, where the heck am I today?

06:18:37.160 --> 06:18:38.160
Sounds like I need to go up here.

06:18:38.160 --> 06:18:41.160
Oh, that's because I do need to go up here.

06:18:44.160 --> 06:18:47.160
Only energy drink I've had is Calcius.

06:18:47.160 --> 06:18:48.160
Calesus?

06:18:48.160 --> 06:18:49.160
What?

06:18:49.160 --> 06:18:51.160
C-E-L.

06:18:51.160 --> 06:18:52.160
Celsius.

06:18:52.160 --> 06:18:53.160
Celsius.

06:18:53.160 --> 06:18:54.160
Oh.

06:18:54.160 --> 06:18:56.160
I got there in the end.

06:18:56.160 --> 06:18:58.160
I got there in the end.

06:18:59.160 --> 06:19:01.160
You just gotta let me cook on some words, okay?

06:19:01.160 --> 06:19:03.160
Some words are like, huh?

06:19:03.160 --> 06:19:04.160
Huh?

06:19:05.160 --> 06:19:07.160
And then you just gotta have full,

06:19:07.160 --> 06:19:09.160
netically spell them out.

06:19:09.160 --> 06:19:11.160
Everyone is streaming right now.

06:19:11.160 --> 06:19:13.160
Oh my god, overlapping corp, I can't believe it.

06:19:15.160 --> 06:19:18.160
I literally tell everyone like, go watch everyone else stream

06:19:18.160 --> 06:19:20.160
because I'm literally just sitting doing like an

06:19:20.160 --> 06:19:22.160
endurance eight hour stream type thing.

06:19:22.160 --> 06:19:24.160
I'm just having a blast.

06:19:24.160 --> 06:19:25.160
Yeah.

06:19:25.160 --> 06:19:27.160
But don't worry when you go live in Mercy,

06:19:27.160 --> 06:19:30.160
I always recommend to the girls, please, to go.

06:19:30.160 --> 06:19:33.160
No, I always recommend to the brief links

06:19:33.160 --> 06:19:37.160
to give you a chance and check you out.

06:19:37.160 --> 06:19:41.160
See, we work because odds are I'm still going to be streaming

06:19:41.160 --> 06:19:42.160
by the time you...

06:19:42.160 --> 06:19:45.160
Oh, I wasn't supposed to be discovered.

06:19:46.160 --> 06:19:48.160
Oh well, so we over...

06:19:48.160 --> 06:19:49.160
It's fine.

06:19:49.160 --> 06:19:50.160
We're doing it to...

06:19:50.160 --> 06:19:51.160
Look at that.

06:19:51.160 --> 06:19:52.160
Look at that.

06:19:52.160 --> 06:19:53.160
Combat cam.

06:19:53.160 --> 06:19:54.160
Combat cam.

06:19:55.160 --> 06:19:56.160
Ooh.

06:19:56.160 --> 06:19:58.160
Is that Azura live right now with that link?

06:19:58.160 --> 06:19:59.160
Or is that Imi?

06:19:59.160 --> 06:20:01.160
Or is that just everyone's link altogether?

06:20:01.160 --> 06:20:03.160
Silence discord mode.

06:20:03.160 --> 06:20:04.160
Oh, you're not discord mode at all.

06:20:04.160 --> 06:20:05.160
YouTube mode.

06:20:05.160 --> 06:20:06.160
I'm just kidding.

06:20:06.160 --> 06:20:07.160
Thank you for moderating for free.

06:20:07.160 --> 06:20:08.160
I really appreciate it.

06:20:08.160 --> 06:20:11.160
Actually, all the girls really do appreciate it because

06:20:12.160 --> 06:20:14.160
it's kind of like one of those like jobs,

06:20:14.160 --> 06:20:17.160
you know, like the silent, unrecognized work,

06:20:17.160 --> 06:20:19.160
but I actually genuinely like thank you to everyone

06:20:19.160 --> 06:20:21.160
who like applied to be a mod,

06:20:21.160 --> 06:20:23.160
and like thank you for everyone just being like

06:20:23.160 --> 06:20:25.160
cool at the mods and all that shiz.

06:20:27.160 --> 06:20:28.160
Really appreciate that.

06:20:28.160 --> 06:20:31.160
But then again, silence, YouTube mode.

06:20:32.160 --> 06:20:34.160
With all that said, and all due respect.

06:20:36.160 --> 06:20:38.160
Oh, I'm just getting spotted by everyone.

06:20:38.160 --> 06:20:39.160
Reisa, we're just in a big fight.

06:20:41.160 --> 06:20:42.160
Oh no, they have guns.

06:20:44.160 --> 06:20:45.160
Calling their assassins.

06:20:45.160 --> 06:20:46.160
Calling their assassins.

06:20:48.160 --> 06:20:49.160
Okay, I'm not dealing with them all.

06:20:49.160 --> 06:20:50.160
You can kill them all.

06:20:51.160 --> 06:20:52.160
I'm not dealing with them.

06:20:53.160 --> 06:20:54.160
Whoa, they literally...

06:20:56.160 --> 06:20:58.160
Is he gonna see me entering the castle?

06:20:58.160 --> 06:20:59.160
I think I may.

06:20:59.160 --> 06:21:00.160
I simply have all...

06:21:01.160 --> 06:21:03.160
You tell the girls to watch the girls.

06:21:03.160 --> 06:21:04.160
No, I said it wrong.

06:21:04.160 --> 06:21:05.160
I said it wrong.

06:21:05.160 --> 06:21:06.160
They do it for free.

06:21:06.160 --> 06:21:07.160
I mean, literally.

06:21:08.160 --> 06:21:10.160
Azura and Emmy are...

06:21:10.160 --> 06:21:11.160
Azura is online as well.

06:21:11.160 --> 06:21:15.160
Oh, if there are any Azura Dulay,

06:21:15.160 --> 06:21:17.160
she is officially online as well.

06:21:17.160 --> 06:21:19.160
If you're an Azura Dulay, watch her.

06:21:19.160 --> 06:21:21.160
I ordered a fresh batch of la Catorre la last night.

06:21:21.160 --> 06:21:23.160
Oh, so no one has tasted my Catorre.

06:21:24.160 --> 06:21:25.160
But the Pope has taken it all.

06:21:25.160 --> 06:21:26.160
Where is the Pope?

06:21:26.160 --> 06:21:27.160
He meets with Cesare.

06:21:28.160 --> 06:21:29.160
Strange.

06:21:29.160 --> 06:21:30.160
He did not tell me.

06:21:30.160 --> 06:21:31.160
Cesare had returned.

06:21:31.160 --> 06:21:32.160
Imagine being a Mortarader.

06:21:33.160 --> 06:21:34.160
Imagine...

06:21:35.160 --> 06:21:36.160
Okay.

06:21:36.160 --> 06:21:37.160
Now what?

06:21:38.160 --> 06:21:40.160
Sorry, I'm starting to lose that little bit.

06:21:40.160 --> 06:21:42.160
I was like, imagine being a Mortarader.

06:21:42.160 --> 06:21:43.160
Okay, now what happens?

06:21:44.160 --> 06:21:45.160
Danny, did anything else?

06:21:46.160 --> 06:21:47.160
I'm imagining.

06:21:47.160 --> 06:21:49.160
With my mind only, I'm imagining.

06:21:52.160 --> 06:21:54.160
Okay, I'm getting a bit delirious.

06:21:54.160 --> 06:21:55.160
I think it's like...

06:21:56.160 --> 06:21:58.160
Bro, I know I said this yesterday.

06:21:58.160 --> 06:22:00.160
We were so delirious during that group collab.

06:22:00.160 --> 06:22:04.160
But I'm so excited for our official group game collab together.

06:22:04.160 --> 06:22:06.160
I hope you guys like the intro.

06:22:06.160 --> 06:22:09.160
I'm going to script it when we start up the streams.

06:22:11.160 --> 06:22:14.160
And literally, everyone's going to be streaming it.

06:22:15.160 --> 06:22:18.160
So you can see all six POVs at once.

06:22:22.160 --> 06:22:23.160
Oh, I'm burping away.

06:22:25.160 --> 06:22:27.160
You've been at this for six hours.

06:22:28.160 --> 06:22:29.160
Honestly.

06:22:33.160 --> 06:22:35.160
You, come here so I can assassinate you.

06:22:36.160 --> 06:22:37.160
That's right.

06:22:37.160 --> 06:22:38.160
Come closer.

06:22:38.160 --> 06:22:39.160
I can sense thine penis.

06:22:40.160 --> 06:22:41.160
Okay, sorry.

06:22:41.160 --> 06:22:42.160
I shouldn't have said that.

06:22:42.160 --> 06:22:43.160
I like that.

06:22:45.160 --> 06:22:47.160
I think I'm actually doing the same thing a little bit.

06:22:48.160 --> 06:22:49.160
But hey, hope.

06:22:49.160 --> 06:22:50.160
It's not just life.

06:22:51.160 --> 06:22:52.160
Let's go.

06:22:54.160 --> 06:22:56.160
Oh, I don't know why I said that.

06:22:56.160 --> 06:22:58.160
I'm remembering just like, hee hee.

06:22:58.160 --> 06:22:59.160
Oh, I'm notorious.

06:23:00.160 --> 06:23:02.160
I didn't lure my notoriety.

06:23:04.160 --> 06:23:05.160
Oh, it sucks.

06:23:06.160 --> 06:23:07.160
I almost got caught.

06:23:07.160 --> 06:23:09.160
Well, actually, it doesn't really matter if I get caught by him.

06:23:09.160 --> 06:23:10.160
He doesn't come.

06:23:13.160 --> 06:23:15.160
How do you not see me?

06:23:15.160 --> 06:23:16.160
I'm literally on a bookcase.

06:23:16.160 --> 06:23:17.160
I'm doing the ballard.

06:23:18.160 --> 06:23:19.160
Okay.

06:23:22.160 --> 06:23:24.160
God, he's so armored out the world.

06:23:26.160 --> 06:23:28.160
I have something on my mind.

06:23:28.160 --> 06:23:32.160
Look, all I'm saying is that the marshmallows have been having a good time on marshmallows.

06:23:34.160 --> 06:23:35.160
Oh, whips.

06:23:35.160 --> 06:23:36.160
I wasn't supposed to jump down.

06:23:36.160 --> 06:23:37.160
Hail.

06:23:37.160 --> 06:23:38.160
Whoopsie.

06:23:38.160 --> 06:23:43.160
Oh, I'm getting in trouble.

06:23:43.160 --> 06:23:47.160
I don't remember all these enemies being here.

06:23:47.160 --> 06:23:50.160
I'm going to have to remember when I'm doing the, like, do not be detected.

06:23:50.160 --> 06:23:54.160
Like, you put that away.

06:23:54.160 --> 06:23:56.160
Literally diddle-dee-dee.

06:23:56.160 --> 06:23:58.160
And I shall first get wrecked.

06:23:59.160 --> 06:24:02.160
This town ain't big enough for the both of us.

06:24:02.160 --> 06:24:03.160
Cowboy.

06:24:03.160 --> 06:24:04.160
Oh, that's 6,000.

06:24:05.160 --> 06:24:07.160
We're getting so near the end of the game.

06:24:09.160 --> 06:24:10.160
What has happened here?

06:24:10.160 --> 06:24:11.160
I do not know what you mean.

06:24:11.160 --> 06:24:12.160
I want to take.

06:24:12.160 --> 06:24:13.160
I take.

06:24:15.160 --> 06:24:17.160
If I want you to die.

06:24:17.160 --> 06:24:18.160
You.

06:24:18.160 --> 06:24:19.160
Even those with an army.

06:24:19.160 --> 06:24:21.160
You intend to give me money?

06:24:22.160 --> 06:24:24.160
No, I do not.

06:24:24.160 --> 06:24:27.160
Then I will use the piece of Eden to get what I want.

06:24:27.160 --> 06:24:29.160
Your help is not necessary.

06:24:31.160 --> 06:24:33.160
That has been made abundantly to me.

06:24:35.160 --> 06:24:36.160
That says dad.

06:24:36.160 --> 06:24:40.160
Are you aware that the Baron de Valois is dead?

06:24:40.160 --> 06:24:41.160
No.

06:24:41.160 --> 06:24:42.160
Did you?

06:24:42.160 --> 06:24:44.160
What reason could I possibly have to kill him?

06:24:45.160 --> 06:24:50.160
Was he plotting against me with my brilliant, treacherous captain general?

06:24:50.160 --> 06:24:52.160
I do not have to stand for this.

06:24:53.160 --> 06:24:55.160
The assassins murdered him.

06:24:55.160 --> 06:24:57.160
Why did you not stop them?

06:24:57.160 --> 06:24:59.160
As if I could.

06:24:59.160 --> 06:25:02.160
It was not my decision to attack Monteriggione.

06:25:02.160 --> 06:25:03.160
It was yours.

06:25:04.160 --> 06:25:05.160
Shh.

06:25:06.160 --> 06:25:09.160
It is high time you took responsibilities for your actions.

06:25:09.160 --> 06:25:11.160
My accomplishments.

06:25:11.160 --> 06:25:15.160
Despite the constant interference of failures like you.

06:25:17.160 --> 06:25:19.160
You are not going anywhere.

06:25:20.160 --> 06:25:21.160
I have the piece.

06:25:21.160 --> 06:25:22.160
Out of my way, old man.

06:25:24.160 --> 06:25:26.160
Get out of my way, old man.

06:25:28.160 --> 06:25:31.160
I gave you everything and yet it's never enough.

06:25:31.160 --> 06:25:34.160
Cesare, he intends to poison you.

06:25:40.160 --> 06:25:42.160
You have not listened to reason.

06:25:43.160 --> 06:25:46.160
Father, do you not see?

06:25:47.160 --> 06:25:50.160
I can control all of this.

06:25:52.160 --> 06:25:55.160
If I want to live, I live.

06:25:55.160 --> 06:25:59.160
If I want to take, I take.

06:26:01.160 --> 06:26:06.160
And if I want you to die, you die.

06:26:07.160 --> 06:26:09.160
It's so good.

06:26:09.160 --> 06:26:12.160
Where is the piece of Eden?

06:26:12.160 --> 06:26:14.160
I know where it is.

06:26:14.160 --> 06:26:17.160
And you did not tell me he had taken it.

06:26:17.160 --> 06:26:20.160
Cesare, it's me, your queen.

06:26:22.160 --> 06:26:23.160
You are my sister.

06:26:23.160 --> 06:26:24.160
None more.

06:26:26.160 --> 06:26:27.160
Where is it?

06:26:27.160 --> 06:26:28.160
You never loved me?

06:26:28.160 --> 06:26:30.160
You never loved me?

06:26:30.160 --> 06:26:32.160
Where is the apple?

06:26:32.160 --> 06:26:33.160
Tell me.

06:26:38.160 --> 06:26:40.160
The voice acting is so good.

06:26:40.160 --> 06:26:42.160
Tell me.

06:26:43.160 --> 06:26:44.160
Tell me.

06:26:47.160 --> 06:26:49.160
It's just so good.

06:26:49.160 --> 06:26:52.160
It's just so good.

06:26:52.160 --> 06:26:55.160
Thank you for letting me share this game with you.

06:26:55.160 --> 06:26:57.160
Fun fact, you don't need to hurt anyone.

06:26:57.160 --> 06:26:59.160
Oh, no, no, go over, Etsy.

06:27:01.160 --> 06:27:02.160
Etsy.

06:27:02.160 --> 06:27:04.160
Oh, you're giving me a heart attack.

06:27:04.160 --> 06:27:05.160
Etsy.

06:27:05.160 --> 06:27:07.160
Oh, Etsy.

06:27:07.160 --> 06:27:09.160
Oh, you're giving me a heart attack.

06:27:09.160 --> 06:27:10.160
Little sister.

06:27:10.160 --> 06:27:11.160
I know.

06:27:11.160 --> 06:27:12.160
I know.

06:27:12.160 --> 06:27:14.160
Fucking hell, I was having a heart attack.

06:27:14.160 --> 06:27:15.160
Do you see that?

06:27:15.160 --> 06:27:16.160
They're related?

06:27:16.160 --> 06:27:18.160
Yeah, it's based on history.

06:27:20.160 --> 06:27:21.160
I could see.

06:27:23.160 --> 06:27:25.160
No, where that bastard is going.

06:27:25.160 --> 06:27:26.160
San Pietro.

06:27:27.160 --> 06:27:29.160
The pavilion in the courtyard.

06:27:29.160 --> 06:27:31.160
The pavilion in the courtyard.

06:27:31.160 --> 06:27:32.160
Hmm.

06:27:37.160 --> 06:27:39.160
Exit through the front gate.

06:27:39.160 --> 06:27:41.160
Wait, am I still going to get attacked by guards?

06:27:41.160 --> 06:27:42.160
Oh, oh, wrong way.

06:27:42.160 --> 06:27:43.160
Etsy.

06:27:43.160 --> 06:27:46.160
You've just got such a big palace.

06:27:48.160 --> 06:27:50.160
I'll come back for you later.

06:27:51.160 --> 06:27:52.160
See you later.

06:27:52.160 --> 06:27:54.160
I'll come for you later.

06:27:54.160 --> 06:27:55.160
See you later.

06:27:55.160 --> 06:27:56.160
Like this.

06:27:59.160 --> 06:28:00.160
Assassino.

06:28:04.160 --> 06:28:06.160
I will come for you.

06:28:06.160 --> 06:28:07.160
Wait.

06:28:07.160 --> 06:28:08.160
Later.

06:28:09.160 --> 06:28:11.160
I'll come for you later.

06:28:15.160 --> 06:28:16.160
I just like doing that.

06:28:19.160 --> 06:28:20.160
Reefling.

06:28:20.160 --> 06:28:21.160
Reefling.

06:28:21.160 --> 06:28:23.160
I'll come back for you later.

06:28:23.160 --> 06:28:24.160
Later.

06:28:24.160 --> 06:28:26.160
I'll come back for you later.

06:28:26.160 --> 06:28:27.160
Yes, I will.

06:28:27.160 --> 06:28:29.160
Who's a good Reefling?

06:28:29.160 --> 06:28:31.160
Have you been a good boy?

06:28:31.160 --> 06:28:33.160
Is it time for your daily milky-wilky?

06:28:37.160 --> 06:28:38.160
Oopsies.

06:28:38.160 --> 06:28:39.160
Oopsies.

06:28:39.160 --> 06:28:40.160
Oopsies.

06:28:40.160 --> 06:28:41.160
Wait, he was in my way.

06:28:41.160 --> 06:28:43.160
Am I supposed to just ignore him?

06:28:43.160 --> 06:28:44.160
I think I am.

06:28:44.160 --> 06:28:46.160
I will remember that for when we redo the mission.

06:28:48.160 --> 06:28:49.160
Spiral scare.

06:28:49.160 --> 06:28:50.160
Right.

06:28:50.160 --> 06:28:55.160
So that you can grab this box because the timer don't start until now.

06:28:55.160 --> 06:29:00.160
You have to leg it for this entire next section.

06:29:00.160 --> 06:29:01.160
Okay?

06:29:01.160 --> 06:29:03.160
You have to do it for the entire next day.

06:29:03.160 --> 06:29:07.160
Fucking let's go.

06:29:07.160 --> 06:29:08.160
Well, you're stuck in the cutscene.

06:29:08.160 --> 06:29:09.160
Give it a second.

06:29:09.160 --> 06:29:10.160
Let it cook.

06:29:10.160 --> 06:29:11.160
Let it cook.

06:29:11.160 --> 06:29:12.160
Let's go.

06:29:12.160 --> 06:29:13.160
Don't worry.

06:29:13.160 --> 06:29:14.160
Leave a faith.

06:29:14.160 --> 06:29:15.160
Leave a faith.

06:29:15.160 --> 06:29:16.160
Don't worry.

06:29:16.160 --> 06:29:17.160
Don't worry.

06:29:17.160 --> 06:29:18.160
Leave a faith.

06:29:18.160 --> 06:29:19.160
Promise.

06:29:19.160 --> 06:29:20.160
Promise.

06:29:20.160 --> 06:29:21.160
Ta-da.

06:29:21.160 --> 06:29:22.160
See?

06:29:22.160 --> 06:29:23.160
It's right there.

06:29:23.160 --> 06:29:29.160
And then if you go in the street of the pavilion, it's the easiest way to navigate to the place.

06:29:29.160 --> 06:29:30.160
Okay?

06:29:30.160 --> 06:29:32.160
And then you need to do the jump thing.

06:29:32.160 --> 06:29:33.160
Jump.

06:29:33.160 --> 06:29:36.160
And then just take the main street all the way up to the pavilion.

06:29:36.160 --> 06:29:40.160
And just jump every time you see an agility at the bottom of your screen.

06:29:40.160 --> 06:29:41.160
You just jump.

06:29:41.160 --> 06:29:42.160
And they can't get you.

06:29:42.160 --> 06:29:43.160
Jump.

06:29:43.160 --> 06:29:44.160
See?

06:29:44.160 --> 06:29:46.160
The AI unclogs you.

06:29:46.160 --> 06:29:47.160
Jump.

06:29:47.160 --> 06:29:48.160
Jump.

06:29:48.160 --> 06:29:49.160
Jump.

06:29:49.160 --> 06:29:54.160
And then you'll be perfectly fine.

06:29:54.160 --> 06:29:55.160
Jump.

06:29:55.160 --> 06:29:57.160
Now you might have to fight them at the end.

06:29:57.160 --> 06:30:03.160
I honestly don't understand what the development team actually wanted from you at this point.

06:30:03.160 --> 06:30:04.160
Please leave me alone.

06:30:04.160 --> 06:30:07.160
But oh, he almost touched me.

06:30:07.160 --> 06:30:08.160
He touched my ankle.

06:30:08.160 --> 06:30:09.160
Oh, he's touching me.

06:30:09.160 --> 06:30:11.160
He's touching me.

06:30:11.160 --> 06:30:12.160
Okay.

06:30:12.160 --> 06:30:14.160
And then they opened up.

06:30:14.160 --> 06:30:16.160
And then we just go inside.

06:30:16.160 --> 06:30:20.160
And then sometimes you may have to come outside and fight, but it's okay.

06:30:20.160 --> 06:30:22.160
It's okay.

06:30:22.160 --> 06:30:23.160
Okay.

06:30:23.160 --> 06:30:24.160
So we were...

06:30:24.160 --> 06:30:29.160
That's a lot of bad guys.

06:30:29.160 --> 06:30:30.160
No.

06:30:30.160 --> 06:30:31.160
Okay.

06:30:31.160 --> 06:30:32.160
We got one.

06:30:32.160 --> 06:30:33.160
Oh.

06:30:33.160 --> 06:30:35.160
Oh, I'm getting ganged on.

06:30:35.160 --> 06:30:36.160
I'm getting ganged up.

06:30:36.160 --> 06:30:37.160
I don't like it.

06:30:37.160 --> 06:30:38.160
Take this.

06:30:38.160 --> 06:30:39.160
And this.

06:30:39.160 --> 06:30:40.160
And this.

06:30:40.160 --> 06:30:41.160
And this.

06:30:41.160 --> 06:30:42.160
And this.

06:30:42.160 --> 06:30:43.160
And this.

06:30:43.160 --> 06:30:44.160
And this.

06:30:44.160 --> 06:30:45.160
And this.

06:30:45.160 --> 06:30:46.160
Okay.

06:30:46.160 --> 06:30:53.160
Unfortunately we are in range because of that yellow on the map, but we might be able to

06:30:53.160 --> 06:30:54.160
stand here.

06:30:54.160 --> 06:31:00.160
It should time out because they're not supposed to actually see us.

06:31:00.160 --> 06:31:01.160
There we go.

06:31:01.160 --> 06:31:02.160
There we go.

06:31:02.160 --> 06:31:06.160
Now, did you guys remember the pineapple?

06:31:07.160 --> 06:31:10.160
Did you remember the pineapple?

06:31:10.160 --> 06:31:13.160
We did a little eagle vision.

06:31:13.160 --> 06:31:16.160
The pineapple is glowing.

06:31:22.160 --> 06:31:24.160
I was right there.

06:31:24.160 --> 06:31:25.160
What?

06:31:25.160 --> 06:31:27.160
I was there all along.

06:31:27.160 --> 06:31:29.160
Excuse me?

06:31:29.160 --> 06:31:31.160
Looking for this.

06:31:31.160 --> 06:31:32.160
Don't kill us, Sino.

06:31:32.160 --> 06:31:40.160
My sword will take your life.

06:31:40.160 --> 06:31:43.160
Hydration.

06:31:43.160 --> 06:31:45.160
Wow.

06:31:45.160 --> 06:31:48.160
Those armor clinking sounds.

06:31:48.160 --> 06:31:50.160
Good sound effect.

06:31:50.160 --> 06:31:51.160
Guards.

06:31:51.160 --> 06:31:52.160
Guards.

06:31:52.160 --> 06:31:54.520
Oh, Chasary.

06:31:54.520 --> 06:31:57.160
Your time can't last.

06:31:57.160 --> 06:32:00.560
Not while I come in with the apple.

06:32:00.560 --> 06:32:04.040
Okay, so basically just run

06:32:05.520 --> 06:32:09.180
Wait hold on let me let me open the map. Sorry to bring down the energy

06:32:09.180 --> 06:32:12.280
I need to open the map because I always forget which direction I need to go in

06:32:12.500 --> 06:32:17.680
So I need to keep going dead ahead and then take a right. Okay. Let's go

06:32:23.040 --> 06:32:29.600
It is just a waste of time trying to stop and hurt like get rid of all these enemies

06:32:30.560 --> 06:32:36.760
There's no point. So just outrun them until you get to the water and swim like your life depends on it

06:32:36.760 --> 06:32:38.760
They keep they jump in me

06:32:39.760 --> 06:32:41.760
Get off

06:32:41.760 --> 06:32:43.600
Get off

06:32:43.600 --> 06:32:45.600
Away naughty

06:32:46.400 --> 06:32:51.760
No, if you follow this street, I think it takes you to the water. Oh

06:32:53.360 --> 06:32:57.180
I don't like those brute guys. They're actually pretty strong. Oh

06:32:58.180 --> 06:33:00.180
Oh

06:33:05.780 --> 06:33:13.940
When the moon hits your high like a big piece of pie that's a morning

06:33:17.820 --> 06:33:20.920
Bills will ring ring a ding a ding

06:33:21.920 --> 06:33:23.920
Pizza

06:33:25.600 --> 06:33:27.600
And that's how you get away from that sequence

06:33:28.560 --> 06:33:35.320
Jump on that boat and get out of there. You do not have to attack anyone. You do not have to eliminate any enemies

06:33:35.840 --> 06:33:38.600
Jump in that boat and you are safe

06:33:42.880 --> 06:33:44.880
Oh

06:33:50.920 --> 06:33:54.480
To assemble his remaining support coming weeks

06:33:56.000 --> 06:33:58.000
When the moon hits your eye, that's a strongy

06:34:04.680 --> 06:34:11.560
It's blinding odd my models not reactive to what happens on screen and he put that back on I love that

06:34:11.680 --> 06:34:13.680
That was like the funniest thing

06:34:16.480 --> 06:34:18.480
My eyes

06:34:19.480 --> 06:34:23.600
We do have no a right a sight to see us down

06:34:28.920 --> 06:34:30.920
Flashbang

06:34:32.560 --> 06:34:37.880
I think for the loser guards and touch the pineapple without hurting anyone just pop a smoke bomb and getting a crowded bench

06:34:37.880 --> 06:34:43.480
I wonder that may be the solution. They are everywhere and nowhere at once

06:34:43.480 --> 06:34:45.480
I

06:34:46.680 --> 06:34:50.440
We cannot on our own senior you must help us. I am

06:34:52.600 --> 06:34:54.600
Idiot

06:34:55.600 --> 06:34:59.400
And then you will see how quickly the assassini fall

06:35:02.080 --> 06:35:04.080
Delude yourself Chesere

06:35:04.600 --> 06:35:06.600
Oh

06:35:10.800 --> 06:35:13.240
Right so the apple is a bit funny

06:35:13.240 --> 06:35:20.080
Do you see that white one that white line means imminent death the yellow means under my control

06:35:21.400 --> 06:35:22.960
and

06:35:22.960 --> 06:35:26.040
So we want to basically the apple will take your health

06:35:26.040 --> 06:35:28.040
so I have to wait until it restores and

06:35:28.600 --> 06:35:34.800
Then wait and then it kills the people who we want to kill and then the others are either under my control

06:35:34.800 --> 06:35:38.560
Or we'll fight for me. It's a bit finicky, but once you learn it you get it

06:35:42.000 --> 06:35:45.360
We're teleporting all over the map. We're at the blooming

06:35:46.640 --> 06:35:48.440
Rose

06:35:48.440 --> 06:35:50.440
Yes

06:35:52.720 --> 06:35:54.720
Under stress

06:35:54.960 --> 06:36:00.760
Any anyone else under stress and we're feeling about a key need not a bit of a

06:36:02.600 --> 06:36:04.600
I'm not gonna say it's too easy too easy

06:36:09.480 --> 06:36:14.400
So the point of Assassin's Creed is to get rid of the apples of Eden, however

06:36:15.800 --> 06:36:17.800
It's always a good good boy and

06:36:18.480 --> 06:36:20.120
his

06:36:20.120 --> 06:36:23.200
DNA communes with the apple so his bloodline

06:36:23.800 --> 06:36:25.800
Kind of has been chosen

06:36:26.520 --> 06:36:32.160
I'm pretty sure the guys around this corner actually and I've gone too far. Yeah, there is and

06:36:34.840 --> 06:36:36.840
Feel the cardinal

06:36:37.400 --> 06:36:40.200
He I think he just runs down this hill and then that's it

06:36:40.400 --> 06:36:45.640
You do not have access to your recruits at this time, but you don't need it because you literally have the apple Eden

06:36:45.640 --> 06:36:51.680
I will say one thing the more. Oh, no, actually it doesn't affect with the more armor you have

06:36:52.680 --> 06:36:58.400
Also on the weapon wheel, you can't select anything when you hold the apple of Eden, but I won't even let you take it out

06:37:05.840 --> 06:37:08.400
So we just need to follow him into the coliseum

06:37:10.320 --> 06:37:18.080
Okay, no, no, I'm not here. Uh-uh. No, uh-uh. You didn't see me. No. Oh, you're actually a liar

06:37:18.680 --> 06:37:23.320
And and I will you you guards just spawned in

06:37:24.120 --> 06:37:26.320
Don't lie. You just spawned in rain in front of me

06:37:27.600 --> 06:37:29.600
as a see

06:37:31.640 --> 06:37:33.640
And a cup

06:37:34.840 --> 06:37:38.560
You won't find me because I'm not what you need

06:37:39.480 --> 06:37:41.000
I'm

06:37:41.000 --> 06:37:43.840
Your end maker caretaker

06:37:44.480 --> 06:37:58.000
My bikini ever has to be mentioned enough. It wasn't I've unbended everything so there's no chance of accident or bikini show

06:37:58.000 --> 06:38:00.000
I apologize

06:38:00.240 --> 06:38:02.240
Borja money has become tainted

06:38:04.440 --> 06:38:06.440
Main control apple

06:38:07.120 --> 06:38:09.120
I

06:38:13.360 --> 06:38:15.360
Okay, again same thing

06:38:15.520 --> 06:38:22.640
Unfortunately, this is very awkward and you can call in your recruits, but it's not very good at all. I'm try

06:38:23.040 --> 06:38:25.040
Okay, this isn't working wait

06:38:25.880 --> 06:38:31.320
He attacked me and he died. Did you see that right? I'm just calling in my recruits. They're not very strong, but

06:38:32.320 --> 06:38:38.480
We'll try we'll try I don't normally like doing it because recruits can definitely die at this section

06:38:38.920 --> 06:38:42.200
because of the overwhelming amount of enemies that

06:38:42.800 --> 06:38:47.320
Letting enemies that come in but again white mark around who you would wish to

06:38:48.000 --> 06:38:51.520
Eliminate right off the bat and hopefully my assassin recruits stay around

06:38:52.920 --> 06:38:57.360
So he's coming straight for me. So once I've healed up again

06:38:57.960 --> 06:39:01.560
You just need to do the white you can also see the white line on their

06:39:02.680 --> 06:39:06.600
The horse knocked him out of range. So we'll need to try that one again

06:39:07.640 --> 06:39:09.640
So they're now fighting each other

06:39:11.360 --> 06:39:13.360
Again white line

06:39:13.520 --> 06:39:14.760
Got him

06:39:14.760 --> 06:39:17.680
Yeah, see my assassin recruits are getting damaged on their health

06:39:17.680 --> 06:39:21.720
I really do not enjoy calling them in on this mission. It is dangerous

06:39:21.720 --> 06:39:26.240
You can lose recruits here if they're not leveled up enough. I really did not spend much

06:39:27.360 --> 06:39:29.000
Where's the apple?

06:39:29.000 --> 06:39:31.600
Whoa, he's like slow mo getting me

06:39:32.280 --> 06:39:36.040
Okay, we've got two more to go two more to go let him get up let him get up

06:39:37.640 --> 06:39:42.960
But go for him first cuz you actually know we won't cuz my assassin recruit just did that. Oh

06:39:43.800 --> 06:39:48.800
Someone's load not good. Not good. This is why I really don't like I really don't want anyone to perish

06:39:49.560 --> 06:39:51.560
Oh

06:39:53.160 --> 06:39:57.440
Did he survive I didn't get a notification saying that one passed away. I

06:39:59.280 --> 06:40:04.240
Know you much of an ASMR enjoyer, but any change your mind. That's fantastic

06:40:05.280 --> 06:40:09.800
I like you. You just got to find someone that fits your groove and they can interest you into something new

06:40:10.840 --> 06:40:16.480
Johnny miss ma. How are you doing? Have you been good?

06:40:18.920 --> 06:40:20.920
Mmm-hmm

06:40:21.240 --> 06:40:24.160
We playing assassin's creed up in this house

06:40:25.960 --> 06:40:32.160
We're literally about to finish the game after an amazing gaming session you can ignore the guards here the

06:40:32.800 --> 06:40:35.400
Campaign should take over once you approach these

06:40:37.560 --> 06:40:41.960
So very good another time me. Did you stream today or have you streamed yet?

06:40:44.280 --> 06:40:46.280
Are you taking break today?

06:40:46.680 --> 06:40:49.800
I mean ASMR was great. It does all

06:40:56.920 --> 06:41:02.920
So now we get our cool Avengers moment where everyone's with us helping us and

06:41:04.040 --> 06:41:06.040
You can actually

06:41:06.720 --> 06:41:10.280
Successfully kill all everyone in this sequence

06:41:11.240 --> 06:41:17.040
Oh, I can't use my mouse. I can't use my blades. I'm so used to using them

06:41:17.840 --> 06:41:24.640
You're still playing absolutely. We're just about to finish the campaign. I'm so excited. Oh, no, that recruit so low

06:41:24.640 --> 06:41:35.200
Oh, I feel like I need to help them. Oh, okay. Okay. Good catch. Good catch. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

06:41:36.000 --> 06:41:39.240
I'm dead. I only have one HP. Oh

06:41:40.280 --> 06:41:43.800
I need it to reach in. No, I don't want any assassins to fall

06:41:44.440 --> 06:41:52.240
Stop attacking her. Stop. I don't have health to freaking use the apple. Please gang up on him. Thank you. My goodness. Oh

06:41:53.440 --> 06:41:55.440
No, oh

06:41:55.480 --> 06:41:57.480
Please okay yellow. Oh

06:41:59.800 --> 06:42:01.800
Someone's gonna pass away

06:42:04.520 --> 06:42:08.200
Okay, so we just finished

06:42:09.040 --> 06:42:10.320
Oh

06:42:10.320 --> 06:42:12.320
No one perished

06:42:12.320 --> 06:42:18.120
Oh, that was so lucky. So we've now finished the sequence and we're all waiting

06:42:19.400 --> 06:42:21.400
All five of us avenger style

06:42:21.400 --> 06:42:23.200
On your own

06:42:23.200 --> 06:42:28.600
We can let us troops must behind me. We will take back my city

06:42:29.920 --> 06:42:36.240
This is not your city anymore by order of Pope Julius second. I arrest you

06:42:36.240 --> 06:42:41.720
They are crime on the crimes of murder betrayal and incest

06:42:42.120 --> 06:42:47.320
No, no, no, no, no, this is not how it ends

06:42:47.680 --> 06:42:52.680
James will not hold me. I will not die by the hands of man

06:42:59.320 --> 06:43:01.320
Was the manner in which he said it

06:43:04.240 --> 06:43:07.000
Didn't know that was a crime back then honestly

06:43:08.360 --> 06:43:09.960
true

06:43:09.960 --> 06:43:13.800
question marks because all we hear about bloodlines is

06:43:14.240 --> 06:43:17.840
You know about Royals and that so was it like

06:43:18.360 --> 06:43:23.800
Royals are allowed to do it, but the common people aren't allowed to do it. You know as peasants

06:43:25.560 --> 06:43:27.560
I cannot risk it

06:43:32.480 --> 06:43:34.480
I must go

06:43:36.440 --> 06:43:43.080
Jezary was right. I have to leave when I'm usually my people need me build this brotherhood to last with or without me

06:43:44.760 --> 06:43:46.760
Plant a seed

06:43:46.800 --> 06:43:48.800
Plot plant a seed

06:43:50.160 --> 06:43:52.160
Then keep your money

06:43:52.680 --> 06:43:56.480
We will see each other again. You have my bonafortuna

06:44:01.240 --> 06:44:08.240
Bonafortuna take the money your meager salary you will need it my patron has been arrested after all

06:44:09.600 --> 06:44:11.600
true

06:44:14.080 --> 06:44:16.080
Mm-hmm

06:44:16.400 --> 06:44:18.960

Whoo, hello. No, it's not. I have my iPhone on fuck. Oh my iPhone is burning

06:45:11.920 --> 06:45:16.040
Let me just pause that real quick. Oh, did you see all of them?

06:45:19.720 --> 06:45:25.720
Okay, hold on that am I back up to sink, okay? Oh

06:45:26.520 --> 06:45:30.060
Just yeah, it's like in so fast there

06:45:30.660 --> 06:45:32.660
Oh

06:45:35.660 --> 06:45:39.460
Then a cannonball should appear. Yeah, there you go cannonball

06:45:40.620 --> 06:45:42.620
And it got me as well. I

06:45:43.740 --> 06:45:45.740
My iPhone's on fire

06:45:50.100 --> 06:45:56.100
Hidden blade only let's go. I'm a hidden blade some people enjoy the source some people enjoy the heavy weaponry

06:45:56.900 --> 06:45:58.100
I

06:45:58.100 --> 06:46:02.620
Double assassin blade for me. I died through I better know I'm died

06:46:04.620 --> 06:46:11.860
For the phones about to explode honestly, I hope not, but it's very hot. I think because it's charged like I've charged it

06:46:13.780 --> 06:46:15.780
This entire time

06:46:16.540 --> 06:46:18.540
Like it's got charger

06:46:19.540 --> 06:46:21.540
Oh

06:46:22.260 --> 06:46:29.700
The iPhone better get used to it you better not be there raises stamina levels for me

06:46:32.700 --> 06:46:35.100
Mmm the cinematic

06:46:36.420 --> 06:46:42.340
Like when it does like the cinematic kill it looks so nice and like all the different weaponry

06:46:42.340 --> 06:46:46.860
I have to admit so like obviously not matter someone prepare something else

06:46:47.860 --> 06:46:50.060
Not the whole oh, wait, no, I lied

06:46:52.820 --> 06:46:55.820
I lied I thought all the horsey's got no

06:46:57.980 --> 06:46:59.980
I

06:47:00.020 --> 06:47:05.220
Completely forgot I thought all the horses go back up. Why would they do that at the end of the game?

06:47:05.220 --> 06:47:07.220
I assume I'm allowed to be spotted

06:47:08.780 --> 06:47:13.580
Doesn't matter if I get spotted or is this one of them ones where I shouldn't be spotted

06:47:17.180 --> 06:47:22.100
No, I can be spot, that's absolutely fine with me

06:47:23.420 --> 06:47:27.140
But they're heavy mason heavy infantry

06:47:29.300 --> 06:47:31.820
Doesn't matter if I get spot, so I'm just gonna send it I

06:47:32.900 --> 06:47:38.620
Can't believe I forgot about that horsey war see I do apologize. I don't like when they do that

06:47:39.420 --> 06:47:45.380
He's just taking a nap. He's just taking a nap. I mean I take one too, you know, he needs to sleep off

06:47:45.380 --> 06:47:47.380
He needs to sleep off what happened

06:47:48.460 --> 06:47:51.660
No, you've not seen me before unless you know

06:48:02.980 --> 06:48:04.980
The batteries swelled up

06:48:05.940 --> 06:48:10.140
We did I left my Android phone on charge for you and the battery so like

06:48:10.860 --> 06:48:12.900
Like pop like a balloon type swell

06:48:15.380 --> 06:48:17.380
It's his dangerous

06:48:27.500 --> 06:48:29.500
Honestly, pray bruising

06:48:29.620 --> 06:48:31.620
Ah

06:48:35.500 --> 06:48:37.500
Leave me alone

06:48:43.780 --> 06:48:47.780
Unfortunately for this section both factions will target you

06:48:51.460 --> 06:48:57.820
So the best advice really is to go at the checkpoint and destroy whoever goes for you

06:48:59.500 --> 06:49:04.580
And they will always sign but you can't progress until they leave you alone

06:49:04.580 --> 06:49:07.620
So just I can't actually see what's going on, but thank you

06:49:09.340 --> 06:49:13.140
Okay, there you go. You just need to wait for them to leave you alone

06:49:14.780 --> 06:49:18.500
Any water my battery make sure it's not too cool and it too hot

06:49:21.580 --> 06:49:25.560
Yes, it's so the smartest thing to do is to claim the burning

06:49:26.020 --> 06:49:30.200
Siege tower you're you're so smart the wooden flammable siege tower

06:49:31.320 --> 06:49:33.320
Not sure about that one it's

06:49:34.280 --> 06:49:36.560
Like your accent. Thanks spawned in with it

06:49:39.520 --> 06:49:42.560
Spacey phone pillow keeps your pillow nice and warm

06:49:44.360 --> 06:49:46.360
Do we need to take the rooftops I actually

06:49:47.600 --> 06:49:52.520
Well, that was a lot of enemies to appear on the screen

06:49:52.600 --> 06:49:55.720
This section is the same where both factions will target you

06:49:58.680 --> 06:50:02.800
You need to become an anonymous can I hide behind this and

06:50:04.360 --> 06:50:07.900
Be left alone. Oh, is he gonna attack me?

06:50:12.440 --> 06:50:14.440
Okay, okay, I

06:50:14.680 --> 06:50:20.240
Was trying to see if I can get away with it. It's just a bit like why would they both randomly target me?

06:50:20.240 --> 06:50:21.600
I have no

06:50:21.600 --> 06:50:27.040
Like fight with them, but I don't even know who they're they're fighting each other and they're the same

06:50:28.240 --> 06:50:31.760
They have the same uniform on they found the traitor

06:50:35.160 --> 06:50:37.160
I know what wrong when I'm gonna guess

06:50:39.160 --> 06:50:41.160
Leave me alone

06:50:44.720 --> 06:50:47.320
Right, let's try again this time it's not on fire

06:50:47.320 --> 06:50:52.000
My world's on fire, how about yours?

06:50:53.560 --> 06:50:55.560
No, I

06:50:55.800 --> 06:51:01.920
The water's getting thin the water's getting warm so you might as well swim. Mm-hmm. I don't know the words

06:51:01.920 --> 06:51:03.920
I can never remember what I

06:51:04.720 --> 06:51:12.080
Can never remember words in order of like actual songs and then the best I can do is go

06:51:12.360 --> 06:51:14.360
Ah

06:51:14.680 --> 06:51:19.760
The back streets a never gone what you wanna say banana banana, what you gonna do?

06:51:20.400 --> 06:51:22.000
That's not a word

06:51:22.000 --> 06:51:26.560
Hey, now you're an assassin get your game on cool play

06:51:28.680 --> 06:51:34.960
His name's not Caesar Chasry's gonna die kicking in my balls

06:51:37.520 --> 06:51:39.520
Hey

06:51:42.080 --> 06:51:44.080
That's right, baby

06:51:47.640 --> 06:51:52.900
So much to kill so much to do so much assassinate and on the spreadsheets a

06:51:53.640 --> 06:52:02.200
Never know when I'm gonna strike a don't know if it's good advice a so much to pee so much to do

06:52:03.640 --> 06:52:08.640
Gotta disarm the guard I can't do that so that's fine. I'm taking out the double knife

06:52:13.000 --> 06:52:16.240
Trying to pistol whip try again with the tip. Oh

06:52:18.440 --> 06:52:24.280
It's actually much easier just to shoot Chasry there if you should have you take a health bar

06:52:26.360 --> 06:52:28.360
And removing his armor

06:52:30.360 --> 06:52:34.060
He wishes he was a farmer. Oh, he got me first

06:52:34.300 --> 06:52:36.300
Oh

06:52:36.620 --> 06:52:38.540
You can't

06:52:38.540 --> 06:52:45.620
No, run at a time. Oh, he broke my armor. Oh, that's not good. Oh, that's not good. Okay. I actually don't want that

06:52:45.620 --> 06:52:47.620
I'm taking it my double bleeds

06:52:51.060 --> 06:52:52.740
Take this

06:52:52.740 --> 06:53:00.300
Take that in this and take my knee to your boss my knee to your boss

06:53:01.300 --> 06:53:04.780
Didn't want to put my balls on your jaws

06:53:05.740 --> 06:53:10.100
It's my knee. Oh shit. I'm actually kind of messing this up. I might need to try hard

06:53:10.940 --> 06:53:14.700
Hold on. Hold on. Let me get rid of these guards first and then go for Chasry

06:53:14.700 --> 06:53:18.740
But then whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, you can't keep spawning new guards. I

06:53:20.140 --> 06:53:22.780
Mean, maybe you can but like

06:53:23.540 --> 06:53:29.060
You shouldn't you should give me a chance to kill. Oh, we're getting a bit crowded

06:53:29.060 --> 06:53:35.700
We're getting a bit crowded in here. I did it too many of you. This is starting to get a bit here. He's gonna

06:53:37.700 --> 06:53:39.700
Can I do this?

06:53:40.020 --> 06:53:43.580
Okay, Chasry is that's fine. I expected that

06:53:44.780 --> 06:53:48.300
Okay, Chasry's like one seriously. He's like one

06:53:49.420 --> 06:53:51.260
Okay

06:53:51.260 --> 06:53:54.420
One more reload faster. Okay. There we go

06:53:54.940 --> 06:53:56.940
He

06:53:58.580 --> 06:54:00.580
That's really how much Nick armor do you have?

06:54:02.540 --> 06:54:04.860
Wanting something does not make it your right

06:54:06.860 --> 06:54:12.740
That the true leader empowers the people he rules I will lead mankind into a new world

06:54:13.740 --> 06:54:15.740
Can this sooner record you do

06:54:20.860 --> 06:54:23.460
No man can murder me

06:54:24.420 --> 06:54:26.420
Then I leave you in the hands of fate

06:54:43.500 --> 06:54:45.500
The throne was mine

06:54:47.340 --> 06:54:49.540
What do you know what do you know?

06:54:50.420 --> 06:54:52.420
I

06:54:53.740 --> 06:54:58.860
Lead mankind into a new world we take illiterally in these parts

06:55:02.340 --> 06:55:06.820
You cannot kill me no man can murder me

06:55:14.820 --> 06:55:16.820
The apple

06:55:20.540 --> 06:55:27.300
The vault oh my god, we're playing borderlands too. It's the ball

06:55:34.900 --> 06:55:42.180
So it's he was put the apple of Eden away and the vault left behind by the gods, so it's not in the hands of man

06:55:44.260 --> 06:55:46.260
You'll call a sale

06:55:49.540 --> 06:55:52.220
We've got it Colosseum we're about to go to present day

06:55:53.380 --> 06:55:55.380
gravity claims another victim

06:55:56.140 --> 06:55:58.140
fall damage buff

06:55:58.580 --> 06:56:00.580
request

06:56:11.140 --> 06:56:17.940
Perfect recall so we need some kind of futuristic key it seems to open with a verbally triggered mechanism

06:56:18.940 --> 06:56:22.940
It's God kind of why I'm saying it out for back

06:56:24.380 --> 06:56:26.380
That'll be quiet. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm getting too excited

06:56:31.980 --> 06:56:39.500
Like that European power grid is Italy the only country in your you've got

06:56:40.820 --> 06:56:42.820
Problem is he's dead

06:56:47.940 --> 06:56:54.780
Okay, if you cut scenes up, it's all trying to be quiet. I'm just so excited. So I do apologize for talking over like

06:56:56.340 --> 06:56:58.340
Just a bit of I said we belly

06:56:59.100 --> 06:57:01.100
Hey, maybe it has something to do with this

06:57:10.780 --> 06:57:12.700
Symbol matches the one on the door to the vault

06:57:14.700 --> 06:57:17.260
1419 1420 1421

06:57:17.940 --> 06:57:22.580
What if they aren't dates 1419 1420? Oh

06:57:24.140 --> 06:57:26.220
My god, what?

06:57:27.700 --> 06:57:29.060
God

06:57:29.060 --> 06:57:35.140
Tell us already. I am I am that I am the tetragrammaton the 72 names of God

06:57:35.140 --> 06:57:38.300
You see they're all contained within three verses

06:57:38.500 --> 06:57:45.220
Exodus 19 through 21 and to get this your likeness if you arrange the four Hebrew letters in God's name within an equilateral

06:57:45.940 --> 06:57:49.940
Triangle, then you miracle values add up to the same number

06:57:50.700 --> 06:57:53.200
72 are you absolutely sure about this?

06:57:53.660 --> 06:57:56.540
That's kind of why I'm saying it out loud Rebecca. Yeah, but

06:57:59.060 --> 06:58:05.780
Construction on the Colosseum began in the year 72. I think we have our password

06:58:06.540 --> 06:58:08.540
Sean go get the van

06:58:08.860 --> 06:58:10.860
We

06:58:13.980 --> 06:58:20.420
Now know the password to the vault in order to get the apple of Eden

06:58:22.180 --> 06:58:24.780
I'm a calibrate again. Hold on. I

06:58:29.620 --> 06:58:31.620
Calibrated now my mouth

06:58:33.380 --> 06:58:35.380
You know everything

06:58:36.060 --> 06:58:38.060
Really?

06:58:39.500 --> 06:58:44.980
That's right, I've seen your car that tunnel should lead under capital line hill. I'll help them find another entrance

06:58:45.660 --> 06:58:51.020
Be careful Desmond. I'll drive. Ah, yeah, nice try. I've seen your car. Oh

06:58:53.300 --> 06:58:56.140
Base the sassans creed said women bad driver

06:59:02.140 --> 06:59:07.460
That's terrible dev team you knew exactly what you're doing putting that in

06:59:09.140 --> 06:59:13.820
There's a lot of dialogue up heads. I'll try and be quiet

06:59:15.860 --> 06:59:17.860
Lucy I'm making my way toward the entrance

06:59:24.860 --> 06:59:26.860
I'll keep that in mind

06:59:38.540 --> 06:59:40.900
I can't believe I'm actually gonna hold the apple

06:59:45.340 --> 06:59:49.100
Wonder if it'll change this whether it can tip the scales in our favor

06:59:49.780 --> 06:59:53.740
Me trying not to read it like say every quote that I remember I

06:59:54.940 --> 06:59:58.220
Was gonna say tip the scales. I don't know if the make pick that up by literally

07:00:01.900 --> 07:00:04.940
What do you think we'll find hopefully a map

07:00:08.700 --> 07:00:10.700
Yeah

07:00:11.700 --> 07:00:13.700
Hey, maybe this time we'll be lucky

07:00:18.700 --> 07:00:24.820
On my first playthrough I never found this for like ages it's so slight and cheeky

07:00:27.260 --> 07:00:31.420
Cheeky like my little rhythm so much construction this place is like a maze

07:00:39.380 --> 07:00:41.380
I

07:00:42.860 --> 07:00:44.860
Know

07:00:45.660 --> 07:00:51.220
So at the end of this there's a quote from the gods

07:00:53.380 --> 07:00:56.220
And I said a message

07:00:57.780 --> 07:00:59.780
No, we hold on

07:01:00.740 --> 07:01:03.060
So that's why we're playing this game on my birthday

07:01:05.020 --> 07:01:07.580
Because it's October 10th in the present day

07:01:08.700 --> 07:01:10.700
72

07:01:15.140 --> 07:01:18.460
It's the door code someone wants to make sure we get it right

07:01:25.900 --> 07:01:27.060
Okay

07:01:27.060 --> 07:01:29.940
If I don't move the cutscenes not gonna begin

07:01:30.380 --> 07:01:36.100
But I just want to say there's a quote from the God at the end of this and she says go forth and

07:01:36.620 --> 07:01:40.860
And and I may or may not have said be embraced by the six

07:01:41.620 --> 07:01:45.300
Because of that quote and I hope you understand it when you hear it

07:01:47.060 --> 07:01:51.580
So be embraced by the six it's cuz it's all in my love

07:01:53.900 --> 07:01:55.900
And the other is the six

07:01:57.380 --> 07:02:01.140
Just wait for okay, just wait for it. I tell you I tell you I show you I show you

07:02:02.220 --> 07:02:05.100
But I hope the six have embraced you dearly

07:02:07.020 --> 07:02:13.100
I'm braced us by the no set six number six numeral in those today's quadros

07:02:13.620 --> 07:02:16.260
Cincuses, I know it's kind of hard just

07:02:19.660 --> 07:02:21.900
We commit to this space the epilogue

07:02:23.260 --> 07:02:27.660
Let it be found by he who is deemed worthy let it guide him

07:02:28.140 --> 07:02:30.140
Let it shape his path forward

07:02:30.660 --> 07:02:33.180
Let it save the world we leave behind

07:02:34.020 --> 07:02:36.020
Who are you?

07:02:39.300 --> 07:02:41.300
Jino

07:02:47.540 --> 07:02:51.460
We're getting close boys to the end. I don't want it to end but

07:02:54.500 --> 07:03:00.020
That's been fan half the cleanest campaign sorry went the wrong way dafty and I don't want me to go

07:03:04.180 --> 07:03:08.580
I'm getting like really close to getting chills cuz like I know what's up ahead

07:03:18.380 --> 07:03:23.180
In the beginning we set our truth to parchment to stone

07:03:23.740 --> 07:03:25.740
to the memory of men

07:03:26.140 --> 07:03:29.180
These proved impermanent thing. I'm sorry my mouth's open

07:03:34.020 --> 07:03:37.700
Blood literally like a child like

07:03:43.860 --> 07:03:51.180
Oh clings by fire clings by famine such such like huge dialogue

07:03:52.020 --> 07:03:55.780
Just to show that history cannot last on parchment like it's just such

07:03:56.580 --> 07:03:58.580
genius

07:04:03.580 --> 07:04:05.580
I

07:04:10.580 --> 07:04:12.580
Think I found an entrance

07:04:12.580 --> 07:04:18.740
You think you found an entrance after the like the freaking floor the pavilion opens up. Okay. Yeah entrance, okay?

07:04:22.180 --> 07:04:24.180
Wow

07:04:25.860 --> 07:04:29.340
Hmm oh I'm getting chills

07:04:33.180 --> 07:04:35.180
I

07:04:41.820 --> 07:04:44.860
Let me in I'm coming

07:04:50.220 --> 07:04:52.140
But on what can it last took you long enough

07:04:53.340 --> 07:04:55.900
What is this? What happens if it didn't have to last?

07:04:56.940 --> 07:04:59.820
See those columns. What if we just enjoyed every moment?

07:05:03.180 --> 07:05:05.180
On top of the ancient Temple of Juno

07:05:07.580 --> 07:05:13.540
I like the ceiling do you like the ceiling you are a fascinating traveling companion

07:05:23.780 --> 07:05:29.580
Look how detailed this is there's something up there like

07:05:30.580 --> 07:05:32.580
2010

07:05:34.860 --> 07:05:39.340
Like look how accurate it is please can we do history games?

07:05:39.900 --> 07:05:46.740
Where we can all just nerd about history and like the things like they even bother to do the text and stuff like under the

07:05:46.740 --> 07:05:48.740
Paintings to be like this is from

07:05:49.580 --> 07:05:51.580
like

07:05:53.260 --> 07:05:55.260
Such a good game

07:05:55.260 --> 07:05:57.260
Just stay down here then shall we oh

07:05:57.460 --> 07:06:02.180
Pray or something. It's appreciate everything. It's so good. It's so good

07:06:02.180 --> 07:06:06.660
I'm so glad I get to share the game with you and hopefully you maybe play on your own sometime

07:06:08.100 --> 07:06:10.100
You've experienced

07:06:18.140 --> 07:06:21.660
That guy is sassy Sean is a very sassy character a

07:06:22.660 --> 07:06:25.140
Very British deadpan

07:06:28.020 --> 07:06:31.940
Wow ready to speak to the gods

07:06:51.980 --> 07:06:54.780
Hey, actually, I'm a he him. Sorry

07:07:11.700 --> 07:07:13.700
Destroyed what we could feel the way of

07:07:16.300 --> 07:07:18.300
Something's open

07:07:21.660 --> 07:07:23.900
Does not take many to unwind the world

07:07:26.540 --> 07:07:28.540
Here is a safe place

07:07:29.180 --> 07:07:32.500
eternal to store objects words

07:07:33.580 --> 07:07:34.860
wisdom

07:07:34.860 --> 07:07:36.860
But not life

07:07:36.860 --> 07:07:38.860
Almost did we have the means?

07:07:39.460 --> 07:07:42.620
But time erodes time. He wrote us

07:07:45.820 --> 07:07:48.940
We distract him we can see past him

07:07:48.940 --> 07:07:50.940
We left when he strikes right

07:07:51.620 --> 07:07:53.620
But his reach is so very long

07:07:54.220 --> 07:07:56.220
It's stamina unending

07:07:57.140 --> 07:07:59.140
We cannot evade his grasp

07:07:59.140 --> 07:08:01.140
not forever

07:08:03.580 --> 07:08:07.260
Here goes so she's telling us why the gods perished

07:08:08.620 --> 07:08:11.900
Because something constantly is getting them

07:08:12.980 --> 07:08:14.980
Just like strutting stamina

07:08:15.780 --> 07:08:18.980
Yeah, I reclaimed you like that my stamina's unending

07:08:20.460 --> 07:08:22.460
It's a shame you have a refractory period

07:08:28.380 --> 07:08:31.660
It must come in with the blood

07:08:45.740 --> 07:08:50.220
I'm I'm Sean in this one

07:08:53.380 --> 07:08:55.580
I'm holding on to the little knob in the middle

07:09:00.980 --> 07:09:02.980
Well, we're doing it

07:09:03.500 --> 07:09:07.260
If you want to kill us mate, you're gonna have to try a little harder than that

07:09:10.660 --> 07:09:12.660
We're here

07:09:13.500 --> 07:09:15.500
Music

07:09:16.860 --> 07:09:18.860
Beautiful scenery the details

07:09:25.100 --> 07:09:28.580
That is Sean's right that is I'm always right

07:09:29.380 --> 07:09:35.780
About that dead end that never happened. I was misquoted music picks up and you can hear the voices

07:09:37.620 --> 07:09:40.940
Just a theory all sounding voices

07:09:43.460 --> 07:09:45.460
And all

07:09:47.060 --> 07:09:50.580
This milk the door is it I'm not being pranked why this is a little in the door

07:09:51.820 --> 07:09:53.700
I'm being pranked

07:09:53.700 --> 07:09:58.220
It's really a secret behind that the kind of lucid there may be a secret, but maybe it's just a reuse that's it

07:10:03.020 --> 07:10:09.300
Think it speaks English just say it okay 72

07:10:12.660 --> 07:10:14.660
Oh

07:10:39.140 --> 07:10:41.140
There's a field

07:10:42.660 --> 07:10:44.660
I

07:10:48.100 --> 07:10:50.100
The apple seems to be in the center

07:10:53.460 --> 07:10:55.460
I'm to find out where those temples are

07:10:57.780 --> 07:11:04.700
Okay, no, this is where the sad part comes in because I always mess up the sequence. I'm really

07:11:04.700 --> 07:11:06.700
I

07:11:12.220 --> 07:11:16.100
Always mess up the sequence the orb

07:11:27.780 --> 07:11:29.780
Big lady

07:11:30.780 --> 07:11:32.780
Knowledge

07:11:34.700 --> 07:11:36.700
Only try

07:11:38.260 --> 07:11:41.140
On a wisdom no knowledge story wisdom wisdom

07:11:43.180 --> 07:11:45.180
Knowledge

07:11:46.900 --> 07:11:48.900
Of course not fake gamer

07:11:52.580 --> 07:11:54.580
Try to join you

07:11:56.540 --> 07:11:58.540
Hear the words

07:11:59.540 --> 07:12:00.540
I

07:12:00.540 --> 07:12:08.260
Have played this game so many times. I always end up failing the levers. I didn't know you could eagle sense the lever. I

07:12:09.580 --> 07:12:14.100
Have just literally my brain said maybe one's highlighted and the other isn't

07:12:14.900 --> 07:12:17.740
How many times have I played this game and never done that before I?

07:12:18.460 --> 07:12:20.460
Always mess up on the lever

07:12:21.700 --> 07:12:23.700
I'll be quite

07:12:28.540 --> 07:12:30.540
Activated

07:12:33.860 --> 07:12:35.860
Did you hear any of that I

07:12:41.020 --> 07:12:46.020
Sure do love all my friends equally. I love Rebecca

07:12:46.020 --> 07:12:52.700
I love Sean and I love Lucy and I'm sure all will be fine

07:12:53.340 --> 07:12:55.340
Wait, where'd I go? Oh

07:12:58.540 --> 07:13:00.540
Oh

07:13:19.420 --> 07:13:24.540
So where are the temples you want me to ask it or think it

07:13:29.140 --> 07:13:31.140
I

07:13:32.740 --> 07:13:34.740
Sure, you asked it the right thing I

07:13:35.420 --> 07:13:37.540
Know this

07:13:37.540 --> 07:13:39.040
That's a frigid cat

07:13:39.040 --> 07:13:42.660
It stands for freedom and that that's a Masonic eye

07:13:43.260 --> 07:13:45.660
Now those two come together in only one place

07:13:47.660 --> 07:13:53.260
I can't move your DNA communes with the apple you have activated it

07:13:54.220 --> 07:13:58.980
Let me go on the 72nd day before the moment of awakening

07:13:59.460 --> 07:14:01.220
You

07:14:01.220 --> 07:14:05.460
Loins and the loins of our enemies the end and the beginning

07:14:06.100 --> 07:14:08.100
Abhor and honor

07:14:08.220 --> 07:14:10.220
The final journey commences

07:14:11.100 --> 07:14:15.820
There is one who would accompany you through the gate. She lies not with our sight

07:14:16.540 --> 07:14:19.140
The cross darkens the horizon

07:14:23.900 --> 07:14:27.220
Doing the path must be opened

07:14:28.740 --> 07:14:32.980
You cannot escape your partners the sales shall be balanced

07:14:36.860 --> 07:14:38.860
Stop please

07:14:38.980 --> 07:14:42.380
You know very little we must guide you

07:14:47.660 --> 07:14:49.660
Please

07:14:54.260 --> 07:14:56.260
No

07:15:08.420 --> 07:15:15.460
It is done the way lies all before you only she remains to be found

07:15:16.620 --> 07:15:18.620
Awaken the six

07:15:23.260 --> 07:15:25.260
You

07:15:40.140 --> 07:15:42.140
Really don't like that

07:15:43.900 --> 07:15:45.900
Really don't like that

07:15:46.020 --> 07:15:50.060
For those of you who haven't played Assassin's Creed 2 and don't mind spoilers

07:15:51.060 --> 07:15:56.380
We were in upstairs goes headquarters and she broke us out

07:15:56.820 --> 07:16:00.980
Because she was pretending to be a Templar. She's actually an assassin

07:16:01.780 --> 07:16:05.940
and then we have just played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, which is

07:16:07.260 --> 07:16:09.260
sequel and

07:16:10.300 --> 07:16:14.820
She got identified as a double crossing agent twice over

07:16:15.580 --> 07:16:17.580
Which made no sense

07:16:17.660 --> 07:16:19.660
Because why would she break us up and

07:16:20.940 --> 07:16:26.740
If you want to know the real reason why Lucy is killed off in it's your story

07:16:26.740 --> 07:16:28.740
Oh, yeah, sorry in Desmond storyline

07:16:40.460 --> 07:16:46.780
The reason why Lucy's character was killed off is because she asked for

07:16:48.580 --> 07:16:50.580
Like the revenue

07:16:51.940 --> 07:16:56.700
Not for like a payout for her voice, but for the revenue split thing that they do

07:16:57.740 --> 07:16:59.740
No, I can never remember the word

07:17:00.780 --> 07:17:05.860
like where you get like payouts constantly like for your voice and

07:17:07.780 --> 07:17:13.140
Royalties yes royalties. She she knew she was onto something

07:17:13.140 --> 07:17:20.020
She was an Assassin's Creed 2 then she's in a second game Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and she said royalties and

07:17:20.340 --> 07:17:23.020
That end sequence was then created

07:17:23.500 --> 07:17:29.900
Because at no point do the gods speak of present-day issues and if you listen to the gods words

07:17:30.420 --> 07:17:37.300
It was like you don't understand. We need to teach you the gods should not interact with Desmond on that level

07:17:37.660 --> 07:17:39.500
lower-wise and

07:17:39.540 --> 07:17:45.100
Because she wanted royalties killed her and plot and they said yeah, well, we don't need you anymore

07:17:46.100 --> 07:17:50.260
So thanks, Ubisoft absolutely destroyed Lucy's storyline

07:17:51.940 --> 07:17:53.940
And

07:17:53.980 --> 07:17:57.380
Yeah, I hope your shareholders are happy because you ruin it for the people

07:17:58.940 --> 07:18:02.820
But other than that other than that really annoying fact

07:18:05.300 --> 07:18:07.300
Otherwise incredibly good game

07:18:08.300 --> 07:18:10.260
Incredibly good game

07:18:10.260 --> 07:18:17.940
I like to pretend that Lucy is still fully alive and acting as a an assassin and all of that. So yeah

07:18:27.900 --> 07:18:31.500
Oh the VA for Rosa passed away, I didn't know that

07:18:37.620 --> 07:18:39.620
Oh

07:18:42.460 --> 07:18:46.620
But yes, that is the story of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood as

07:18:47.620 --> 07:18:52.460
absolutely 10 out of 10 game experience if you ignore

07:18:53.220 --> 07:18:55.220
the very

07:18:55.420 --> 07:18:58.220
ending dialogue and occurrences

07:18:59.220 --> 07:19:05.940
But that was amazing game and I absolutely loved nerdin about it. I'm probably gonna do the board to tell us

07:19:05.940 --> 07:19:07.940
I don't think I'm ready to go off stream just yet

07:19:08.780 --> 07:19:14.820
So sorry for anyone who's perishing right now and their eyes are bulging out of their skull because of how much they need to

07:19:14.820 --> 07:19:19.820
Sleep right now. I'm very sorry. I'm really enjoying this game and

07:19:20.700 --> 07:19:21.780
Yeah

07:19:21.780 --> 07:19:27.740
Are you still doing the second stream? Yes. So today I was to finish the campaign mode and tomorrow

07:19:27.740 --> 07:19:34.980
We're gonna 100% this game because I have never 100% at this game before always wanted to try never did it

07:19:34.980 --> 07:19:39.700
I believe I may have a hundred percent of Assassin's Creed 2 achievement wise

07:19:41.140 --> 07:19:47.820
Which was like a nightmare trying to get all the feathers, but we can talk about that when we play it on

07:19:48.620 --> 07:19:51.720
June June on October 8

07:19:57.660 --> 07:20:01.860
A lot keep going I've got a couple more hours in me. Oh, yeah, damn you got a stamina minute

07:20:04.980 --> 07:20:06.980
Mmm

07:20:07.300 --> 07:20:09.300
Yes, um

07:20:09.940 --> 07:20:12.140
All the feathers took so long

07:20:14.620 --> 07:20:18.860
Schedules set for October so my birthday is October 10th

07:20:19.260 --> 07:20:22.900
Which is when I will do my doughnut on and for my birthday

07:20:22.900 --> 07:20:28.420
I would like to play Assassin's Creed brotherhood all over again, but I'm gonna play it see was lying

07:20:28.420 --> 07:20:32.420
So on the 8th of October Assassin's Creed 2

07:20:33.420 --> 07:20:43.220
a campaign then Assassin's Creed 2 again for 100% and then brotherhood on the 10th and 11th and then on the

07:20:44.060 --> 07:20:48.260
12th and the 6th the 12th and the 13th would be

07:20:48.660 --> 07:20:51.540
Revelations and we will complete its use storyline

07:20:52.420 --> 07:20:54.420
I'm not very well versed in

07:20:54.660 --> 07:20:59.300
Revelations I have played it a couple of times, but I'm not as well there. So I probably can't Japanese

07:21:00.300 --> 07:21:03.700
About the best strategies for the game

07:21:06.020 --> 07:21:09.940
Are you doing the strong you pass out any presented? I don't know like I

07:21:10.580 --> 07:21:15.820
Want I've been looking at some ASMR challenges like the eight hour ASMR stream challenge

07:21:16.140 --> 07:21:18.620
Maybe I might consider that although my voice

07:21:19.100 --> 07:21:24.540
Breaks pretty quickly for ASMR and whispering is the most damaging thing I can do

07:21:24.940 --> 07:21:26.940
Oh

07:21:27.260 --> 07:21:30.460
You should watch embers after revelations

07:21:34.380 --> 07:21:41.100
I would make a reminder for those days I'll be posting my schedule like I've posted my schedule for this week

07:21:43.140 --> 07:21:48.800
After the needy streamer overload, I think it's like a two-hour game question mark

07:21:49.300 --> 07:21:54.140
I actually need to go and buy the American candy

07:21:54.900 --> 07:22:00.620
And those European suits that I don't buy them and then I need to like clean my desk and stuff

07:22:01.780 --> 07:22:03.780
For cuz I'm doing a hand-cam stream

07:22:06.220 --> 07:22:07.740
Hmm

07:22:07.740 --> 07:22:11.540
Stray if mummy go is our mum are you the granny?

07:22:12.980 --> 07:22:16.780
Don't look into the lore too much of a real or came to be

07:22:18.220 --> 07:22:20.700
Technically there are five children birthed from my loins

07:22:21.140 --> 07:22:23.140
I

07:22:23.580 --> 07:22:25.580
Whispering bad for your voice. Yes, I

07:22:25.940 --> 07:22:29.660
May or may not need a really big pee now that I have just been aware of my bladder

07:22:29.660 --> 07:22:31.660
I just sat on my foot

07:22:32.100 --> 07:22:34.420
Like against well, you know

07:22:35.060 --> 07:22:40.940
Against what and then my brain was like oh by the way sensation. I mean, ah, yes. Yes. I believe I need to pee

07:22:41.340 --> 07:22:43.340
Oh

07:22:47.740 --> 07:22:52.380
Mother Mary virgin birth, uh, no, sorry, it was the reeflings doing oopsies

07:22:53.500 --> 07:23:00.060
That is some are both going wild. That's all I'm saying. Hmm. I don't know how we got it. We didn't get kicked out of that convention

07:23:04.700 --> 07:23:08.660
So I am taking jinkies of water which closes tracking and puts my hypnosis on

07:23:09.620 --> 07:23:11.980
But yes, we'll take a very quick pee break

07:23:12.780 --> 07:23:19.740
And I may make a second cup of well be my third cup of tea, but my second that I'll drink on stream with you

07:23:19.740 --> 07:23:25.300
I just need water and drink. I actually don't need any food that those snacks really satiated me

07:23:25.300 --> 07:23:30.300
I have been satiated. I thank you for letting me eat on stream

07:23:30.300 --> 07:23:32.300
No, no, no, no

07:23:33.500 --> 07:23:37.500
Stream elements is how we pay child support. Yeah, I don't know what's going on

07:23:37.500 --> 07:23:42.780
I unironically think you guys were given like so much money collectively to the girls

07:23:43.340 --> 07:23:47.620
Once the tip page was up that you guys broke the PayPal

07:23:49.660 --> 07:23:52.480
Yeah, so thanks for giving us so much money that

07:23:53.780 --> 07:23:56.620
PayPal is now investigating the account or something. I don't know

07:23:56.620 --> 07:24:02.940
Yeah, if you want to support the girls you can always buy the merch they get a hundred percent of the earnings

07:24:03.340 --> 07:24:07.900
None of it goes to the other and all the girls will they say that they own the

07:24:08.420 --> 07:24:09.940
Ubu market

07:24:09.940 --> 07:24:14.380
Accounts and all that they have logins and it's all their stuff. We did not touch it not to do with us

07:24:14.940 --> 07:24:16.940

07:24:17.500 --> 07:24:20.280
Hopefully monetization on YouTube stats

07:24:20.840 --> 07:24:28.920
Statistics update because my statistics were like, yeah, you have 80 watch hours and I'm like, are you sure about that?

07:24:28.920 --> 07:24:32.160

Well, I should be able to but the stats don't say I have the watch time, but I do have the watch time

07:26:09.760 --> 07:26:11.240

07:26:11.240 --> 07:26:17.720
But hopefully we can get our monetization streams and then you know all that I have no idea how long this PayPal issue is gonna last

07:26:19.520 --> 07:26:23.600
You guys give literally unironically give so much money that they can't burst I

07:26:25.560 --> 07:26:28.380
Have like 10 watch hours alone. I

07:26:30.440 --> 07:26:32.440
Missed it'll be flash player

07:26:32.720 --> 07:26:38.960
Binding of Isaac started on it, but I never actually played it at that stage only played it like a couple months back

07:26:44.240 --> 07:26:46.240
The Baron

07:26:51.160 --> 07:26:57.880
Hey like the enemies in this game as well, have you like made them multiplayer enemies or like

07:27:03.160 --> 07:27:05.160
I like as well

07:27:05.200 --> 07:27:10.880
The plot line that love all pay is so like I know it's you

07:27:11.320 --> 07:27:15.520
Nicolo, I know it's you and like all these things coincidentally happen at the same time

07:27:15.520 --> 07:27:20.280
I like stories like that because it's like no no you're wrong please

07:27:21.560 --> 07:27:26.160
But thank goodness we did the no swim part that was awful grabbed a poor man's horse

07:27:26.640 --> 07:27:33.720
Ran up a side of a building a few times and failed and then like dived across this like beam of rope

07:27:34.880 --> 07:27:41.760
Would you consider playing binding of Isaac on stream? Oh boy? You're in for a treat in November the

07:27:42.960 --> 07:27:48.160
official multiplayer for a binding of Isaac goes live and I would absolutely love to play with you guys

07:27:50.200 --> 07:27:54.640
We will be streaming that game often. I am addicted to it

07:27:55.160 --> 07:28:00.040
I've not before anyone asked have you done dead God? No, I've not done dead God

07:28:00.040 --> 07:28:04.160
Hey, I currently am at like I think it's like

07:28:04.960 --> 07:28:08.600
1001% and it's stop that's where I'm at on one fail

07:28:08.600 --> 07:28:13.560
I have absolutely nothing on the two other save files, but I definitely is gonna be a

07:28:14.240 --> 07:28:20.800
Consistently multiplayer streamed game from bits like I'll do like 12 hour runs for the multiplayer game of that week

07:28:20.800 --> 07:28:23.900
And then like we'll pick up a different multiplayer game type thing and

07:28:25.120 --> 07:28:27.120
Which would be fantastic

07:28:29.240 --> 07:28:36.120
Whoo bending of Isaac is hardly it is a random eyes kind of dungeon

07:28:37.400 --> 07:28:41.700
Crawler, but there's a lot of interesting story in the background of it

07:28:42.200 --> 07:28:43.480
I

07:28:43.480 --> 07:28:50.440
Really enjoy it. I actually want to make a review on this game Assassin's Creed brotherhood and as well as

07:28:50.840 --> 07:28:53.240
Binding of Isaac and call to the lamb

07:28:53.800 --> 07:28:57.040
Basically, I want to make like real game reviews

07:28:57.040 --> 07:29:04.840
But only on games that I think we're 10 out of 10 because I can't stop yapping about them and like bring it up like how flawless the

07:29:05.640 --> 07:29:13.200
In rewarding like the gameplay is and how they've like done the tutorials or what aspects have just really stood out

07:29:13.200 --> 07:29:17.000
Like I just really like it anything would be so nice to try it like

07:29:17.520 --> 07:29:23.240
As much as we all like to dog on like video game journalists and stuff like it is definitely

07:29:26.200 --> 07:29:33.600
Please keep yapping enjoy it if you like the binding of Isaac, I highly recommend no, it's I have never heard of no, it's a

07:29:34.840 --> 07:29:39.040
And is it like pixely like Isaac as well?

07:29:41.040 --> 07:29:45.160
From how you talking here would be awesome at giving some game reviews, uh

07:29:47.000 --> 07:29:49.000
I've got it as a donut on

07:29:49.200 --> 07:29:56.320
Like reward it would take a lot of effort though. Like I definitely think after my donut on is finished

07:29:56.400 --> 07:30:03.000
I'll probably have a few shorter games back-to-back and the reason for that is because I'll be like working on rewards. I

07:30:04.920 --> 07:30:11.680
Literally want to like fire the rewards as soon as possible like once it's done and like all of that

07:30:11.840 --> 07:30:13.840
Um

07:30:14.160 --> 07:30:19.000
Not here runs can go for hours. Oh Isaac runs are like one hour

07:30:19.600 --> 07:30:25.760
Sometimes if you get really good items and stuff you can be wrapped up in 30 minutes with Isaac

07:30:28.360 --> 07:30:30.040
Yeah

07:30:30.040 --> 07:30:35.960
Start each review with a five-minute hypnosis section where you turn your own your hypnosis say you will like this game

07:30:35.960 --> 07:30:38.880
That's so good. You will like this game. You will like this game. You will like this game

07:30:41.680 --> 07:30:44.480
Have you considered collab of girls playing?

07:30:46.000 --> 07:30:48.000
Battleground three

07:30:48.360 --> 07:30:50.360
What's bg? Oh

07:30:50.840 --> 07:30:52.840
No, what's bg?

07:30:53.080 --> 07:30:55.080
Battleground right up in background

07:30:56.880 --> 07:31:00.680
Baldur wait the Baldur's gate is multiplayer. I've never played it

07:31:02.040 --> 07:31:06.160
What did I've never played it and realized it was multiplayer

07:31:07.160 --> 07:31:11.700
Big Baldi's gate right so we have just done it

07:31:12.520 --> 07:31:14.520
We are officially

07:31:15.320 --> 07:31:17.480
Goodness gravy. We have a lot of money on our persons

07:31:17.920 --> 07:31:21.200
This is a bit more money than I think you actually need it. So

07:31:22.200 --> 07:31:25.000
It's given capitalism. It's so it's good capitalism

07:31:25.760 --> 07:31:27.760
Put it back and invest in properties and stuff

07:31:27.760 --> 07:31:33.440
I am going to send the birds away. Yeah, sorry. I'm going to send the recruits away to level up a little bit

07:31:34.200 --> 07:31:38.680
I'm going to do a peep. I'm going to make a cup of tea. So a three-minute break, please

07:31:39.640 --> 07:31:41.640
heavily recommend that you

07:31:42.880 --> 07:31:46.960
You know get up walk around stretch your legs and do a little pee-pee as well

07:31:47.960 --> 07:31:52.000
and we are going to do the Borgia towers next and

07:31:52.800 --> 07:31:54.800
then maybe

07:31:55.560 --> 07:31:57.560
possibly

07:31:58.080 --> 07:32:00.080
and

07:32:00.440 --> 07:32:04.960
Maybe some other miscellaneous stuff. That's just wrong

07:32:06.040 --> 07:32:11.000
I'm trying to find something that both of those last two recruits can go on. I mean, I'm got a

07:32:12.640 --> 07:32:14.040
Oh, you're not strong enough

07:32:14.040 --> 07:32:17.800
So I'll send you on a mission on your own and then for a level two

07:32:17.800 --> 07:32:21.960
I will send you on a level one mission because I really don't want anyone to perish

07:32:22.760 --> 07:32:25.560
He I know you could go up on Baldur's gate. That's so cool

07:32:26.560 --> 07:32:27.960
And

07:32:27.960 --> 07:32:30.320
Yes, I will definitely look into Baldur's gate collab

07:32:30.320 --> 07:32:34.040
I would need to research the game before I play because I really don't know what it's all about

07:32:35.400 --> 07:32:39.960
And okay, I am going to go pee pee because my bladder feels like it's about to burst

07:32:39.960 --> 07:32:44.460
I will tell you if it's neon or not. Don't worry before anyone asks. I can already read your mind

07:32:45.480 --> 07:32:47.480
but I'll do the thing where I

07:32:48.360 --> 07:32:53.920
I'll mute and then put the game back on in the background and no one can see from me up here

07:32:54.160 --> 07:32:59.120
Like that guy that yoinked that thing from me when I was away for like two seconds. It's sort of it

07:32:59.840 --> 07:33:03.120
Okay, please consider getting up and going for a

07:33:04.160 --> 07:33:06.160
pee pee in a lake bridge. I will be back

07:33:07.040 --> 07:33:09.040
Incredibly short like hold on me. Yeah

07:33:23.920 --> 07:33:25.920
So

07:33:53.920 --> 07:33:55.920
So

07:34:23.920 --> 07:34:25.920
So

07:34:53.920 --> 07:34:55.920
So

07:35:23.920 --> 07:35:25.920
So

07:35:53.920 --> 07:35:55.920
So

07:36:23.920 --> 07:36:25.920
So

07:36:53.920 --> 07:36:55.920
So

07:37:23.920 --> 07:37:25.920
So

07:37:53.920 --> 07:37:55.920
So

07:38:23.920 --> 07:38:25.920
So

07:38:53.920 --> 07:38:55.920
So

07:38:55.920 --> 07:38:57.920
So

07:38:57.920 --> 07:38:59.920
So

07:39:28.800 --> 07:39:30.800
Oh

07:39:31.840 --> 07:39:35.520
Gee sure would be a shame if we put some more sass on the screen wouldn't that

07:39:37.040 --> 07:39:42.360
Did you stretch your legs or did you stretch your feet if you're still sitting down?

07:39:46.040 --> 07:39:48.040
Go fish, okay

07:39:48.200 --> 07:39:52.000
Right first things first on the realest. I'm not

07:39:53.080 --> 07:39:57.440
We are going to liberate the Borgia zones as you can see we've done two more

07:39:58.320 --> 07:40:03.120
And now that we have arrow storm we can do these extra super difficult ones

07:40:03.840 --> 07:40:05.360
So there's five more

07:40:05.360 --> 07:40:06.640
Borgia zones

07:40:06.640 --> 07:40:12.400
And what we'll do that and we might do layers of romuli romulus. I keep saying romuli. I don't know why

07:40:13.120 --> 07:40:16.400
Oh, there's a new assassin over here. We should go help them

07:40:17.200 --> 07:40:19.200
Oh, they're across the water

07:40:19.600 --> 07:40:23.360
Are we gonna get something I have a honey tea and a wee water

07:40:24.400 --> 07:40:26.400
with me, um

07:40:26.880 --> 07:40:34.240
I'm not hungry. So I didn't need any snack. There is someone over here that needs our help if I could get there

07:40:37.280 --> 07:40:40.480
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I have terrible news

07:40:40.880 --> 07:40:44.640
It turns out if you adequately hydrate there were stairs right there

07:40:45.040 --> 07:40:46.640
It's you

07:40:46.640 --> 07:40:52.720
Um, if you adequately hydrate, uh turns out your your pee isn't neon

07:40:53.600 --> 07:40:54.640

07:40:54.720 --> 07:40:57.520
How what how am I even supposed to get up here? I don't

07:41:00.080 --> 07:41:02.080
Uh, so grass patch

07:41:12.000 --> 07:41:16.160
No, he's coming back for more. He said nah, I just dropped I want more

07:41:16.640 --> 07:41:19.440

I also mercy warning in one hour and 20 minutes

07:41:36.160 --> 07:41:43.280
Our beloved dark yandere is going live. I believe Azura is still live

07:41:44.400 --> 07:41:51.360
And I believe Emmy has wrapped up for ASMR stream and I assume she'd be his so I actually don't know who's online

07:41:53.200 --> 07:41:55.200
Where am I going? I don't know

07:41:57.120 --> 07:42:02.080
Uh, well, we're way closer to this so we'll go here. Uh, how did I get there?

07:42:04.240 --> 07:42:09.200
He's on the other side of this hill. I always get confused on the location of like this hill thing

07:42:10.160 --> 07:42:13.200
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa of wall

07:42:17.040 --> 07:42:19.040

And

07:42:20.400 --> 07:42:21.840

Azur is still streaming. Okay. Azur is still live. I don't sleep sleep. I need to be

07:42:27.840 --> 07:42:29.280
Wait, I mean

07:42:29.280 --> 07:42:33.680
At least some people could see the angle where I was going with the sucky

07:42:34.480 --> 07:42:37.840
Like oh sucky this blood that kind of makes sense

07:42:38.400 --> 07:42:42.560
Okay, so it was up there. I knew it was going to be up there. I always get confused

07:42:43.440 --> 07:42:44.560
I

07:42:44.560 --> 07:42:47.440
I'm freaking sick. I'm gonna have to run back all the way around again

07:42:48.240 --> 07:42:50.240

Um, but Azura duly is live right now with her very sultry voice. So please do not be afraid to check her out

07:43:04.560 --> 07:43:08.960
Uh, I understand that uh playing the same game for eight hours may get

07:43:09.520 --> 07:43:16.080
Rather tiresome for some of you. So please do not be afraid to support my gen mates at will

07:43:16.160 --> 07:43:20.400
Oh, this is one of the worst. You need our storm to complete this one as well

07:43:23.120 --> 07:43:25.120
Emmy's ASMR got deleted

07:43:28.160 --> 07:43:30.160
Oh, I guess she's on a warning now

07:43:32.000 --> 07:43:35.120

07:44:03.440 --> 07:44:06.480
She had a bit too much fun. What the heck did she do in that stream?

07:44:07.200 --> 07:44:11.040
Goddamn we memeing on assassin's screen and she's over there doing

07:44:12.720 --> 07:44:18.400
Uh, right. We need to wait for our assassin signals to be ready for this next session. It's that cushion

07:44:19.440 --> 07:44:21.440
Um, the bed was squeaking

07:44:25.280 --> 07:44:27.280
Mouth sounds

07:44:27.840 --> 07:44:29.280
She got a warning

07:44:29.280 --> 07:44:35.680
Emmy Emmy Emmy do do a stunt. Okay. Go go on your twitter and be like youtube

07:44:35.680 --> 07:44:38.880
This is so unfair. You're targeting me or something like that

07:44:39.280 --> 07:44:46.560
And then I'll get picked up by vtuber news thing and then uh, I don't know question marks and then profit or something

07:44:46.640 --> 07:44:48.640
I don't know

07:44:49.040 --> 07:44:50.800
Hmm

07:44:50.800 --> 07:44:55.520
I definitely think uh youtube is now considering ear licking sounds

07:44:56.480 --> 07:44:58.480
know to be

07:44:59.760 --> 07:45:01.760
Sucking sounds of an alternative

07:45:02.480 --> 07:45:04.240
variation

07:45:04.240 --> 07:45:06.560
And that is why there's this weird crack down

07:45:08.960 --> 07:45:12.080
Um youtube i'm a literally neural day wrote them

07:45:13.840 --> 07:45:19.120
Yeah, newly debuted vtuber banned unfairly. That's right. Get it written in the papers

07:45:19.920 --> 07:45:21.920
teasing i'm teasing

07:45:22.160 --> 07:45:29.680
As long as emmy had a good stream and um her pin pals were enjoying themselves

07:45:30.160 --> 07:45:32.320
Look things happen life ain't that

07:45:33.360 --> 07:45:35.360
Life ain't that serious

07:45:35.600 --> 07:45:40.400
That's uh, uh, we do we do have a uh, hold on. I'm so sorry. I need to

07:45:41.440 --> 07:45:43.440
You okay. Hold on

07:45:45.440 --> 07:45:47.440
Okay, there you go

07:45:48.960 --> 07:45:50.960
Uh, sorry um

07:45:51.200 --> 07:45:56.000
You have to use the sasin signal on him or he runs away and gets away every time

07:45:56.800 --> 07:45:58.800
Um, what was I saying?

07:46:00.080 --> 07:46:03.840
Uh, emmy having fun. Yeah, as long as as long as she had fun as long as the pin pals

07:46:04.720 --> 07:46:06.720
Pen pals had fun

07:46:06.960 --> 07:46:12.640
Then guess what all is good like it's not a big deal or for me. It's not a big deal anyway

07:46:13.200 --> 07:46:18.960
I assume she's fine and everyone's safe and having a good consenting time. It's all that matters at the end of the day

07:46:19.520 --> 07:46:24.320
Uh, she's happy. I'm happy and if she's not happy, I'll try my best to make her a happy beam

07:46:25.600 --> 07:46:27.600
um

07:46:27.680 --> 07:46:29.680
I

07:46:30.080 --> 07:46:35.440
Requesting one of the girls sing a belly idols song white wedding and all the art is about emmy

07:46:36.640 --> 07:46:39.840
I'm gonna be honest. That's going right over my head. If that's something I should know about

07:46:39.920 --> 07:46:44.080
Is that like a reference to I don't know if this can content of the song

07:46:44.800 --> 07:46:46.800
He's gonna be wow wow

07:46:48.000 --> 07:46:51.360
Uh, definitely gonna have to call in my sasin recruits unless

07:46:52.080 --> 07:46:54.480
Vanishing act. Okay. Well try again

07:46:55.680 --> 07:47:01.040
I do actually need to kill quite a few people in the get in the the the smoke

07:47:05.680 --> 07:47:08.320
This is what I think about your long ball

07:47:10.160 --> 07:47:12.320
I'm about to get shafted. Take this

07:47:12.560 --> 07:47:14.560
And this

07:47:15.520 --> 07:47:20.400
No, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Did my assassin recruits just take all my health there?

07:47:23.360 --> 07:47:25.360
I have potent out please

07:47:25.920 --> 07:47:27.920
All right, you jump boom

07:47:30.640 --> 07:47:32.640
Yeah

07:47:35.200 --> 07:47:37.360
Vanishing act stands completely still

07:47:38.320 --> 07:47:45.360
It turns out it's he was actually one of the worst magicians and he's just gonna stick to his daytime job of assassinating people

07:47:48.160 --> 07:47:51.680
Repfield reference. No, I'm sorry. I don't know

07:47:52.800 --> 07:47:59.680
I don't know what a lot of references are, but thank you for showing patience for me

07:48:01.200 --> 07:48:03.200
For I am strong

07:48:03.520 --> 07:48:08.080
On me and there's a ledge that I can climb on so I have to jump

07:48:09.840 --> 07:48:18.240
And then climb up because I still do not have the climbing glove from the anardo's bench

07:48:19.200 --> 07:48:23.680
But we're getting there in the end and even the whiffing ish campaign mode

07:48:24.320 --> 07:48:26.320
I can't not go any

07:48:26.480 --> 07:48:34.560
Oh, I love how goofy I can be with you guys. You're just like, yeah, I'll just start singing when I'll go for

07:48:41.200 --> 07:48:45.440
If there's nobody left alive to talk about you you were stealthy

07:48:46.640 --> 07:48:48.640
What does that mean?

07:48:49.600 --> 07:48:52.880
Are you meaning? Oh, I forgot to burn the tower

07:48:56.720 --> 07:49:01.920
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I love climbing

07:49:02.480 --> 07:49:04.800
I love overexerting my body

07:49:05.440 --> 07:49:06.960
for climbing

07:49:06.960 --> 07:49:11.520
This tower and there were three sides of this tower that are not climbable

07:49:12.160 --> 07:49:15.600
And I climbed over two sides of tower

07:49:16.400 --> 07:49:18.400
of the forge of tower

07:49:18.400 --> 07:49:20.400
Oh

07:49:23.200 --> 07:49:27.520
I think I'm getting a wee bit delirious and won't be honest. I don't like something that I don't know

07:49:29.040 --> 07:49:31.040
and

07:49:31.120 --> 07:49:32.880
Let's see

07:49:32.880 --> 07:49:37.360
Uh, I've made the mistake again. I have to go on the platform

07:49:39.440 --> 07:49:41.440
Delilah

07:49:41.600 --> 07:49:43.600
Where is emi's vod?

07:49:44.160 --> 07:49:49.520
Unfortunately youtube doesn't seem to like earlicking anymore. So it's no longer there

07:49:50.080 --> 07:49:54.160
And sadly no, I will not get anyone to re-upload the vod

07:49:54.880 --> 07:49:57.920
On their channel because it risks their channel

07:49:58.800 --> 07:50:04.080
I want these girls to succeed and have moneys and emi would very much like to move to a place

07:50:04.560 --> 07:50:11.360
That has a freaking washer machine and ac and uh, yeah, I I really don't want emi sweating it up in her

07:50:11.840 --> 07:50:12.960
Uh

07:50:12.960 --> 07:50:18.960
Current situation. So yes, I would like to wait. No, no, don't jump off. I almost did that again

07:50:20.080 --> 07:50:24.640
You're distracting me. You distracted me to the point where I almost jumped off twice

07:50:27.200 --> 07:50:31.920
It's patreon out it is you can find the links in everyone's links

07:50:33.360 --> 07:50:38.480
Um, the website might have got updated to have our links on it now. I'm not sure

07:50:39.200 --> 07:50:41.200
I'm gonna burp

07:50:41.920 --> 07:50:43.600
I'm beautiful

07:50:43.600 --> 07:50:47.120
Can I join velar? I want I want ac too

07:50:48.720 --> 07:50:50.400
I mean

07:50:50.400 --> 07:50:54.800
What you got you got a whole other poll me because if you've got a poll it's no looking good for you

07:50:58.400 --> 07:51:02.240
I'm afraid I have no content creation advice if you've got a poll

07:51:03.120 --> 07:51:05.120
I haven't experienced it. So I ain't got none

07:51:07.360 --> 07:51:09.360
I have no values to you

07:51:11.600 --> 07:51:15.520
The day out here, can you help me? I would gladly fight for you

07:51:16.560 --> 07:51:20.160
Normal household functions. I mean she was like I've no got a washer machine. I'm like

07:51:22.000 --> 07:51:26.000
Uh, I'm starting to think the velar house is looking more and more

07:51:27.440 --> 07:51:32.640
Something I want to invest in because these poor girls are like I want to move out. I want to do this

07:51:32.720 --> 07:51:34.720
I want to do that and I'm like

07:51:34.960 --> 07:51:40.960
Well, I just buy a house and like ship them all out here and then we can just like meme about and stuff

07:51:42.320 --> 07:51:44.640
Because like could you imagine those collabs?

07:51:45.440 --> 07:51:47.360
like just like

07:51:47.360 --> 07:51:54.320
AC bursts into my room and she's like thranny shut up. You're so loud. I'm trying to sleep

07:51:55.280 --> 07:51:57.280
I'm like AC. I'm so sorry

07:51:58.000 --> 07:52:00.000
Like she be comes in the room

07:52:00.480 --> 07:52:03.280
And she's like, throw me. I can't do she be's voice

07:52:05.920 --> 07:52:08.000
But I mean could you imagine

07:52:08.800 --> 07:52:14.400
The noise complaints it would definitely have to be a detached house

07:52:15.360 --> 07:52:16.160
uh

07:52:16.160 --> 07:52:22.560
Cause yeah, that's something crazy. I love the idea of a gen content house, but it's hard to actually oh no you need

07:52:23.760 --> 07:52:25.200
like

07:52:25.200 --> 07:52:30.880
I don't know if you guys like remember in the call of duty days like was it the optic clan

07:52:31.760 --> 07:52:35.840
I can never remember but there is like actual streamer gamer houses like that

07:52:36.560 --> 07:52:38.240
Um

07:52:38.240 --> 07:52:40.400
Can you email for him? Thank you. Um

07:52:41.280 --> 07:52:43.280
Right, this is I know

07:52:43.920 --> 07:52:47.440
You were supposed to write runny zoom ahead. Um

07:52:48.400 --> 07:52:55.760
But like I remember from eons ago being like that's the coolest thing I've ever seen imagine of all youtubers

07:52:55.760 --> 07:52:57.760
I watch live together

07:52:58.000 --> 07:53:00.480
But I remember I think it was like

07:53:01.120 --> 07:53:05.680
Must have been years ago now. No, not the horse. Okay. Thank god he got off the horse. I got scared there

07:53:06.080 --> 07:53:07.200
and

07:53:07.200 --> 07:53:11.280
Tree you're blocking my view of these enemies. I'm just gonna pretend I'm safe ish

07:53:12.240 --> 07:53:14.560
Uh, can no, no, no, no, don't shoot

07:53:15.840 --> 07:53:17.120
Don't shoot

07:53:17.120 --> 07:53:19.120
Stop the bow

07:53:19.120 --> 07:53:23.520
Oh god, there's horses. I'm scared. Oh, I can hear them

07:53:24.240 --> 07:53:27.920
I feel like I'm playing slender man with these like guards on horses honestly

07:53:29.600 --> 07:53:34.160
Oh, I can't sorry. I'm like trying to finish like one sentence whilst playing this game

07:53:35.120 --> 07:53:36.320
Oh

07:53:36.320 --> 07:53:38.320
Take this. Okay. Ow

07:53:39.360 --> 07:53:40.560
Ow

07:53:40.560 --> 07:53:41.760
I fell

07:53:41.760 --> 07:53:43.520
Man, I fell off

07:53:43.520 --> 07:53:46.720
Oh, I'm just gonna let the recruit steal with him. I guess

07:53:48.560 --> 07:53:50.560
Take that stinky

07:53:51.200 --> 07:53:58.400
Stinky stinky. Why why are you not attacking him? Don't be scared. It's so it's so I know you've been in the game for a long time

07:53:58.560 --> 07:54:00.560
But don't be scared like they're not gonna hurt you

07:54:01.200 --> 07:54:04.880
It's fun as roommates in the beginning it gets really

07:54:06.480 --> 07:54:09.920
No, like that they're um, sorry to get back to what I was saying

07:54:10.000 --> 07:54:14.320
I'm sure I read some sort of review of like what it's like to live with other content creators

07:54:14.720 --> 07:54:18.720
And like I'm pretty sure the default is like it is so loud

07:54:19.200 --> 07:54:25.360
Um, I so things get crazy and out of hand so fast like you have to learn to live as roommates

07:54:26.240 --> 07:54:28.240
unironically because

07:54:28.240 --> 07:54:29.760
um

07:54:29.760 --> 07:54:34.320
Like who's going to do this chore who's going to arrange for the food who's going to arrange to

07:54:35.200 --> 07:54:36.880
um

07:54:36.880 --> 07:54:40.880
Like make sure all is good. Like you don't want to be streaming all the time

07:54:40.880 --> 07:54:44.400
Like so you would have to get like business internet, which means they don't

07:54:45.280 --> 07:54:47.280
like um

07:54:47.600 --> 07:54:52.800
Throttle you if you do too much but business internet is like a thousand dollars per month type thing

07:54:52.960 --> 07:54:58.000
Like it's absolutely wild when you start to get to like that level of content house

07:54:58.400 --> 07:55:00.400
Like the bills are

07:55:00.560 --> 07:55:02.560
astronomical

07:55:04.080 --> 07:55:10.960
You find out that emi believes in not flushing to conserve what are known wants to do the dishes to preserve their nails

07:55:12.320 --> 07:55:15.200
Like I absolutely do love it in theory, but it is

07:55:15.840 --> 07:55:18.000
For me it is not plausible

07:55:19.040 --> 07:55:23.520
And it's just like it's not happening. Oh look at all. Oh, we've got level sevens

07:55:24.000 --> 07:55:31.360
Okay, we're getting stronger. They're there. It's not perfect, but definitely getting stronger

07:55:31.840 --> 07:55:37.200
I am going to send some lower levels away

07:55:39.680 --> 07:55:41.680
Um

07:55:44.720 --> 07:55:46.720
That's not gonna work

07:55:46.960 --> 07:55:50.960
Okay, I'm actually just gonna have to send the lower levels on a level up one

07:55:51.120 --> 07:55:52.240
Um

07:55:52.240 --> 07:55:58.480
Oh, well, it's not really like they're you don't lose an assassin signal if you have six available recruits

07:55:58.560 --> 07:56:04.560
So it's not a problem that I cannot send them on a bigger thing. I am however, we're gonna save this poor guy

07:56:05.680 --> 07:56:07.680
I'll send again this recruits

07:56:08.240 --> 07:56:11.840
It's a cool concept. Honestly, I absolutely adore it. Like especially

07:56:12.640 --> 07:56:13.920
um

07:56:13.920 --> 07:56:15.920
Oh this isn't good

07:56:17.600 --> 07:56:19.600
Oh no

07:56:19.920 --> 07:56:21.920
Oh, no

07:56:25.920 --> 07:56:32.480
Yikes, that was that was not how I imagined we'd save the citizen

07:56:34.720 --> 07:56:38.480
Uh, anyway, let's move on to the next Borgia Tower. Shall we?

07:56:40.720 --> 07:56:43.120
Okay, I think I need to go down

07:56:44.880 --> 07:56:47.600
I'll take you. Hello, Mr. Horsey. You're my problem now

07:56:50.400 --> 07:56:52.400
Oh

07:56:52.720 --> 07:56:56.160
And that might be a good concept that could be for like a smart group club. Yeah

07:56:56.880 --> 07:56:58.240
definitely

07:56:58.240 --> 07:57:02.240
Like I said to the girls like as obviously relationships progress and stuff like

07:57:02.960 --> 07:57:06.880
If you are genuinely serious about like wanting to meet up with each other, um

07:57:07.520 --> 07:57:09.520
Like it's a business expense

07:57:09.520 --> 07:57:12.160
and like we can do it but obviously like

07:57:12.880 --> 07:57:15.360
We've known each other for like two months now, but

07:57:16.320 --> 07:57:20.480
Yeah, I guess a bit early to like start shipping each other to each other's houses and that like

07:57:21.040 --> 07:57:23.040
I definitely think we should let things

07:57:23.440 --> 07:57:27.840
You know some of our relationships form and all that like I I can confidently say like I'm 100%

07:57:28.400 --> 07:57:31.440
Comfortable with the girls, but obviously there was a lot behind it. It's like

07:57:31.920 --> 07:57:37.280
Uh, because I like hired them and scouted for uh, no scout is not the right word

07:57:37.600 --> 07:57:39.600
Oh, I don't want to do a lean or do division

07:57:40.480 --> 07:57:41.680
mission

07:57:41.680 --> 07:57:43.040
um

07:57:43.040 --> 07:57:48.720
I didn't scout for any of them for any of you. So I'm gonna start off now. There was no scouting. Um

07:57:51.280 --> 07:57:52.560
Um

07:57:52.560 --> 07:57:56.240
Like there's a bit of truth and like I see myself

07:57:57.280 --> 07:58:00.720
A little bit in all these girls and like I want them to succeed silly

07:58:01.360 --> 07:58:03.360
and

07:58:03.680 --> 07:58:05.680
Like and

07:58:06.000 --> 07:58:08.000
Where am I going with this?

07:58:08.240 --> 07:58:09.920
Whoa

07:58:09.920 --> 07:58:11.920
I don't think I can keep this guy alive

07:58:12.640 --> 07:58:16.400
He's picking on the guy with the lance first that does the most freaking damage

07:58:17.840 --> 07:58:19.840
Please pick the others

07:58:20.960 --> 07:58:26.960
No, let me go first citizen with no armor or weaponry. Goodness gravy

07:58:28.720 --> 07:58:30.720
Um, you're such a good father

07:58:30.720 --> 07:58:36.960
Yeah, but like unironically I do see like a piece of me in each of them and I just want them nothing to succeed

07:58:37.520 --> 07:58:42.160
But I feel like 100 comfortable and confident around them. Like I don't feel any

07:58:43.680 --> 07:58:45.680
Like any anything, um

07:58:47.600 --> 07:58:49.440
Uh

07:58:49.440 --> 07:58:53.200
Like we had a lot of um side comments that were like

07:58:54.640 --> 07:58:59.680
Sorry, I'm a bit new to the terminology. It was called infighting which is like we're

07:59:00.880 --> 07:59:06.720
The girls like we would compare our viewers and be annoyed at each other or something. I'm so sorry

07:59:06.720 --> 07:59:13.120
I was quite new to the terminology if I'm getting it wrong and it was like, oh how long until they start hating each other and it was like

07:59:14.320 --> 07:59:17.920
Like if you guys could see the behind the scenes of us like memeing about on games

07:59:18.400 --> 07:59:23.280
Or having like a fun little gossip or just like having a good time together and I'm just like

07:59:24.160 --> 07:59:25.200
I

07:59:25.200 --> 07:59:32.000
honestly do not think any of them are capable of that and like you guys already know my stance like if it's

07:59:32.880 --> 07:59:36.480
Um, like I just want them to succeed. I just want them to have an amazing time

07:59:36.480 --> 07:59:40.560
I want them to like achieve their goals. Um home improvement achievement of love

07:59:42.720 --> 07:59:45.040
The fart barrier was broken day one

07:59:46.160 --> 07:59:48.160
Funny you mentioned that um

07:59:49.600 --> 07:59:54.720
When the girls like when we had the first meeting so I had to schedule a meeting

07:59:54.720 --> 07:59:58.960
But I said to them it's not a meeting like I'm forcing you guys to like do

07:59:59.920 --> 08:00:05.200
Like, you know when offices make you play games like oh have played this game with your co-worker

08:00:05.600 --> 08:00:09.280
Uh, I've forgotten what the name is like forced like get together time

08:00:10.160 --> 08:00:11.680
um

08:00:11.680 --> 08:00:17.120
I've completely forgotten the name of it like when offices for icebreakers, I guess like

08:00:17.680 --> 08:00:20.560
There's a bit more of a deeper team building

08:00:21.120 --> 08:00:27.600
Team building exercises. Yes when we had the first meeting I was like, right. What game are we gonna play?

08:00:28.160 --> 08:00:31.920
Um, and we figured out a time and we played video games

08:00:32.400 --> 08:00:37.200
And we played for around two hours and our first thing and we were all just giggling because I was like

08:00:37.440 --> 08:00:43.440
Oh, I'm only going to make it like one hour long because I don't want anyone like overexerting themselves

08:00:43.440 --> 08:00:46.080
like it was the first time we had

08:00:47.120 --> 08:00:53.360
Um interacted and we ended up going over the two hour mark and we were just like laughing our little butts off and then

08:00:53.440 --> 08:00:58.080
Sorry, I'm not paying attention to the game. I'm like literally dying and I'm just like teehee my girl's teehee

08:00:58.640 --> 08:01:00.640
And like none of us wanted to go

08:01:00.960 --> 08:01:06.960
But I I did it at the wrong time. So ac was like up pretty late. Um, so she had to go

08:01:07.600 --> 08:01:12.560
Um, but just like it went fantastic and everyone was so nice to each other and it's just

08:01:14.320 --> 08:01:17.840
Okay, I'm calling in the recruits. Hold on. I need help. I'm calling

08:01:18.800 --> 08:01:20.560
Um

08:01:20.560 --> 08:01:23.760
And it was just like such a fantastic time and goofing off and

08:01:24.640 --> 08:01:29.280
Yeah, like instant chemistry like uh, I definitely think um

08:01:30.880 --> 08:01:34.960
Because of the nature of the agency as well like no one here is like

08:01:35.440 --> 08:01:38.800
I don't know like judging like oh puritan or whatever

08:01:39.680 --> 08:01:41.680
Like it's just not a thing

08:01:42.480 --> 08:01:44.240
Um

08:01:44.240 --> 08:01:50.960
But yeah, like I just have an absolute fantastic. Oh, I was gonna lose body and I've not done the viewpoint

08:01:52.480 --> 08:01:55.360
But I've spoken so much. I think my tea might be getting cold

08:01:58.880 --> 08:02:00.960
Okay, it's getting cold. I'm gonna hop my tea

08:02:03.120 --> 08:02:06.640
Yeah, like we have her for just collab. Um

08:02:08.960 --> 08:02:10.960
Wait, wait, hold on

08:02:14.240 --> 08:02:20.080
They're destroying that tower automatically update the map because if it did I have

08:02:22.560 --> 08:02:25.600
What we will test it on the next boarder tower

08:02:26.480 --> 08:02:32.400
I think that automatically updated the map and I didn't have to synchronize the viewpoint. You know that

08:02:34.400 --> 08:02:36.400
Oh

08:02:37.120 --> 08:02:39.120
Oh

08:02:41.360 --> 08:02:48.240
How many times have I played this game and I I didn't know that are you coming or not?

08:02:51.040 --> 08:02:53.040
Are you

08:02:54.000 --> 08:02:58.080
Fine, I'll call in another group of assassins to deal with them because what's going on here

08:03:02.720 --> 08:03:04.720
Yeah

08:03:04.960 --> 08:03:09.200
Can you guys help her my goodness. Jeez. She almost perished

08:03:15.360 --> 08:03:19.200
How ironic the the naughty agency ends up is the most wholesome

08:03:19.440 --> 08:03:22.560
Yeah, like I think it's we're all in the same boat and we're just goofing off like

08:03:23.200 --> 08:03:26.800
Um, when the girls were recording their scripts for the first time

08:03:27.200 --> 08:03:30.880
Like they were so nervous and like oh, is this good enough? Is that good enough?

08:03:30.960 --> 08:03:36.960
And I'm like, you have to start from somewhere like um, mercy for example hadn't done anything

08:03:37.680 --> 08:03:41.440
Uh, like that before so she was like so unsure and I was like

08:03:42.640 --> 08:03:46.160
I was sending her homework and it was literally links on the hub

08:03:46.640 --> 08:03:53.280
And I was like just kind of listen to this and give it our uh, what you think and you know, you can add that next time

08:03:53.840 --> 08:03:58.800
It is very interesting giving people homework because the homework is literally on

08:03:59.120 --> 08:04:01.680
Well, you can imagine where

08:04:02.400 --> 08:04:03.680
Um

08:04:03.680 --> 08:04:07.040
But like mercy so hot like everyone just like was having a goof off and

08:04:07.520 --> 08:04:09.520
so good

08:04:09.840 --> 08:04:13.520
Mercy talking about experience to a point. It was so cute. Can't wait to see more from her. Yes

08:04:14.720 --> 08:04:19.840
Um, she let me I don't know if you've seen the artwork on her twitter, but she

08:04:20.880 --> 08:04:22.880
was very, um

08:04:23.600 --> 08:04:25.200
kind to

08:04:25.280 --> 08:04:27.280
Tell me about her

08:04:27.840 --> 08:04:29.840
friendship with um

08:04:30.880 --> 08:04:33.840
In being you I think it's Celestia. I'm so sorry if it's not Celestia

08:04:34.400 --> 08:04:35.280
um

08:04:35.280 --> 08:04:41.600
And I was like just so touched by her story and I was like I might get her a little doodle and surprise her

08:04:42.160 --> 08:04:47.440
And like I sent it to her and I put a little message and I was just like your story really touched me

08:04:48.080 --> 08:04:48.800
um

08:04:48.800 --> 08:04:54.160
And also red string theory is when you were always gonna come together no matter what

08:04:54.240 --> 08:04:56.240
So I had like a little string in the picture

08:04:56.960 --> 08:05:01.680
Uh, and she sent me an audio over crying and I'm like, oh my god. I just made her cry

08:05:02.160 --> 08:05:04.080
I feel so bad

08:05:04.080 --> 08:05:07.920
But she was like it's happy tears. It's happy tears like thank you so much

08:05:08.720 --> 08:05:13.440
Um, and I was like, oh my god. It sounds so terrible at a context like I made her cry

08:05:19.920 --> 08:05:21.920
My girls are all lovely, um

08:05:24.240 --> 08:05:27.200
Definitely great. I'm looking forward to their one-on-one collabs

08:05:28.560 --> 08:05:32.720
Yeah, I can say that we have a group collab and one-on-one collabs this month. Um

08:05:34.000 --> 08:05:35.840
Because we

08:05:35.840 --> 08:05:41.280
Just everything's just gone so fantastic like so amazing couldn't ask for better like

08:05:42.000 --> 08:05:48.400
Um, they've like recorded their video game lines. So that's kind of like the next big thing

08:05:48.480 --> 08:05:54.160
I hope it can be done by next by july. I don't know at what point maybe

08:05:55.440 --> 08:05:59.120
I'm gonna burp. Oh, pardon me for being so rude. It was not me. It was my food

08:05:59.120 --> 08:06:02.160
It just came up to say hello and now it's gone back down below. Um

08:06:04.880 --> 08:06:06.880
Sorry, uh, what was I saying?

08:06:08.400 --> 08:06:12.080
I have completely and truly forgotten what I was saying

08:06:13.200 --> 08:06:15.200
um

08:06:16.080 --> 08:06:23.760
Yeah, the girls have one-on-one collabs this month, which I'm excited and then we have a full big group collab, which I'm very excited about

08:06:24.320 --> 08:06:25.920
um

08:06:25.920 --> 08:06:31.680
And then after that it might kind of be like trio collabs or four man collabs

08:06:32.160 --> 08:06:37.040
Because not every game has six persons possible. Like it's just not happening

08:06:38.160 --> 08:06:40.160
It's not happening

08:06:40.880 --> 08:06:47.280
I don't know why like they watch me just like annihilate all those people. Can I go on this? Can I go on the gay bail?

08:06:48.080 --> 08:06:50.080
Let me hide in here. See they can't get me

08:06:52.240 --> 08:06:54.240
Um

08:06:54.320 --> 08:06:57.920
But yes, unfortunately not all games are gonna come as a date

08:06:58.400 --> 08:07:05.520
Um six people so we're just gonna have to see what's in there the lethal company among us like basically we are so limited

08:07:06.400 --> 08:07:10.960
Uh, I probably shouldn't actually claim this. Yeah, I was gonna say I should not be claiming this right now

08:07:11.280 --> 08:07:13.280
I need to wait until I can get my recruit

08:07:16.000 --> 08:07:19.120
Uh, wait, can I get lost in the hay bails? Stop

08:07:20.720 --> 08:07:24.560
No, you're not supposed to recognize me in the hay bails. Hold on

08:07:26.160 --> 08:07:33.040
I just I need my uh one. I need one assassin recruit. Oh my goodness. I need to buy armor. You know that

08:07:33.920 --> 08:07:37.920
Because that's that is like scary that one. Wow

08:07:39.120 --> 08:07:41.600
Hold on right. There we go. I can actually finally attack

08:07:42.240 --> 08:07:48.640
The problem is if you don't have like got a assassin recruits to help you like they properly go for you

08:07:50.240 --> 08:07:54.800
Sorry, I'm a bit slow. I'm like try talking. Oh my tea. I forgot my tea already

08:07:55.840 --> 08:07:58.800
What's going on? I can't see because of the camera angle

08:08:00.000 --> 08:08:02.000
Yeah, take that as we get for annoying me

08:08:03.040 --> 08:08:05.040
Sir lands a lot more like sir

08:08:06.160 --> 08:08:08.640
Sir spurts a lot of blood

08:08:09.280 --> 08:08:13.680
Ha ha I got him. Okay. Let me finish my tea. Oh no momento, please

08:08:25.520 --> 08:08:28.320
Yep, that's honey tea. All right made by myself

08:08:29.040 --> 08:08:31.040
Um

08:08:33.920 --> 08:08:41.200
Um, I think it's just called black tea or uh regular breakfast English tea is what it what it is

08:08:44.800 --> 08:08:46.800
And then just some milk and honey

08:08:46.960 --> 08:08:48.960
Uh

08:08:54.400 --> 08:08:58.480
Right, I need to climb this so I will I will

08:08:59.840 --> 08:09:01.840
I will claim it by identifying

08:09:02.080 --> 08:09:05.760
I really need to buy the Leonardo glove because this stuff would be so much easier

08:09:06.160 --> 08:09:10.000
Right, we are going to test it. The map is not unlocked. I repeat

08:09:10.720 --> 08:09:13.600
The map is not unlocked, which means

08:09:14.240 --> 08:09:16.240
Then you go left then you go right

08:09:17.360 --> 08:09:21.040
No, I can't go right. I have to go left right. I'll go left then. Um

08:09:25.520 --> 08:09:27.520
Wait

08:09:28.160 --> 08:09:31.680
Am I going crazy or can I not claim this without gloves?

08:09:34.320 --> 08:09:36.320
Hey

08:09:37.120 --> 08:09:43.600
Wait, I actually need gloves to work. I don't recall needing gloves to do this. Is it this?

08:09:43.840 --> 08:09:50.560
Okay, this looks like it. Yeah, this looks like it. Holy moley moley. Wait up. Wait up over here

08:09:50.800 --> 08:09:57.040
My goodness, this tower is uh, very uniqueness nature. That took me a whole second together

08:09:57.760 --> 08:10:03.040
You burp from tea a burp from everything if I eat a burp of a talk a burp

08:10:03.680 --> 08:10:07.680
Uh, I seem to like gulp air when I breathe unfortunately, which

08:10:08.480 --> 08:10:10.480
Leads to all of this

08:10:11.120 --> 08:10:15.200
I knew I could hear that. Yeah. Well, I don't want to go get it right now. So

08:10:16.160 --> 08:10:18.160
Bye

08:10:20.160 --> 08:10:24.160
Uh, yes

08:10:27.040 --> 08:10:29.040
Hmm

08:10:29.280 --> 08:10:31.280
Okay arrow storm is back

08:10:33.120 --> 08:10:38.800
Okay, we are not doing the viewpoint because if I ignite this and it unlocks on the map

08:10:39.040 --> 08:10:41.920
I've learned something new about my game yet again

08:10:45.200 --> 08:10:49.280
I'm learning I'm learning does it unlock the map

08:10:49.280 --> 08:10:51.280
Uh

08:10:59.840 --> 08:11:01.840
It's true

08:11:01.840 --> 08:11:08.160
It unlocks the map. Oh, I just realized I'm covering up the map, but it unlocks the map if you do destroy the tower

08:11:09.200 --> 08:11:11.760
You're still playing. I never stop them

08:11:12.800 --> 08:11:14.800
We've got one more board just on to liberate

08:11:15.760 --> 08:11:17.760
Yeah

08:11:17.760 --> 08:11:20.800
It appears there is a citizen that requires our help

08:11:21.680 --> 08:11:23.680
Allow me citizen

08:11:23.760 --> 08:11:25.760
Let him go eagle sound

08:11:26.240 --> 08:11:28.240
Oh, that was not an eagle sound at all

08:11:29.360 --> 08:11:33.760
Hello, I am your knight in training armor. It's the auditoria da fedenze

08:11:36.240 --> 08:11:38.240
Deliberation of roma has begun

08:11:39.280 --> 08:11:41.280
It's running built

08:11:42.480 --> 08:11:44.480
Yeah, allow me to follow you

08:11:45.360 --> 08:11:49.680
Started streaming squints eight hours ago. Yeah, I like my game

08:11:50.560 --> 08:11:56.480
Uh, especially if it's a video game that I have an a tendency for uh, this game

08:11:56.720 --> 08:11:59.280
I probably played it the most out of all games. So

08:12:00.000 --> 08:12:02.800
So it's very easy for me to be like

08:12:05.600 --> 08:12:09.680
With the game actually I should be unlocking these tunnel entrances

08:12:10.240 --> 08:12:17.920
For fast travel, but I'm a bit lazy. We'll buy some buildings just because I have so much money in me pocket

08:12:19.920 --> 08:12:24.800
Uh, how many runs in this game it is impossible to say like

08:12:26.240 --> 08:12:31.680
I probably could comfortably say like over a hundred times just like casually

08:12:32.880 --> 08:12:35.840
Playing it doing different strategies like some

08:12:36.640 --> 08:12:40.880
Strategy I'll say strategies and brackets. So when the game started

08:12:40.960 --> 08:12:47.360
I would like purposely buy all the areas I possibly could and then finish the next act and then unlock everything in that area

08:12:47.360 --> 08:12:48.880
then

08:12:48.880 --> 08:12:49.680
um

08:12:49.680 --> 08:12:56.240
Like completely ignore all the monetary aspects and just go with the weakest weapons or like fully equip them out and

08:12:56.640 --> 08:12:58.960
Like just all these different variations

08:12:59.920 --> 08:13:07.120
Um, I did try black flag. Sadly I suck. Um, and I really struggled to get into it

08:13:07.520 --> 08:13:13.360
I am very by I I just absolutely mogged to that older woman there. I don't know if you saw that

08:13:14.880 --> 08:13:19.600
I just smashed into her. Um, I did play black flag. I'm rubbish

08:13:21.280 --> 08:13:26.160
If someone has never played any assassin screen games, should I start at the beginning of the series or the series?

08:13:26.160 --> 08:13:28.160
We can jump in at once. Ooh

08:13:28.160 --> 08:13:31.360
That's a harder question to answer

08:13:33.600 --> 08:13:35.600
I

08:13:36.320 --> 08:13:38.320
Think you're

08:13:38.880 --> 08:13:40.880
Hmm

08:13:44.320 --> 08:13:47.120
From my completely biased standpoint

08:13:47.760 --> 08:13:53.680
Um, I believe you should start at Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to understand the type of game it is

08:13:54.080 --> 08:13:58.640
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the easiest game to play in the series in my opinion

08:13:59.040 --> 08:14:03.200
However, you are going to start in the middle of the story of Ezio

08:14:03.760 --> 08:14:07.520
If you do want to play Assassin's Creed 2, it's not impossible

08:14:08.080 --> 08:14:13.520
Um, but you don't have assassin recruits, for example to help you out in a fight. Um, you are on your own

08:14:13.760 --> 08:14:16.640
You do have mercenaries that you can buy on the street

08:14:17.200 --> 08:14:23.600
To help you out. It's not impossible. Definitely don't be discouraged. Um, but my recommendation is

08:14:23.840 --> 08:14:25.840
Ezio's storyline

08:14:26.160 --> 08:14:33.600
Which is Assassin's Creed 2, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed Revelations overall very easy games to play

08:14:34.160 --> 08:14:36.160
Revelations got a bit

08:14:36.160 --> 08:14:38.160
um

08:14:38.720 --> 08:14:42.800
In my humble opinion, uh revelations

08:14:43.840 --> 08:14:48.000
Kind of went a bit too far with the notoriety aspect

08:14:48.960 --> 08:14:50.960
um

08:14:51.040 --> 08:14:57.360
I understand that you can't just have the same game over and over in every installment. I do comprehend that

08:14:58.080 --> 08:14:59.200
but um

08:14:59.200 --> 08:15:05.360
The way they did notoriety and revelations was every time you renovated a building in the district

08:15:06.000 --> 08:15:09.760
That the assassins owned your notoriety goes up

08:15:10.320 --> 08:15:16.480
And the district is more than likely to be attacked and if you don't defend it you lose it and

08:15:16.560 --> 08:15:18.560
And

08:15:18.800 --> 08:15:26.000
In the nicest way, I don't like gameplay like that. I like to be like, ah, I feel accomplished

08:15:26.000 --> 08:15:28.240
Like I've just renovated that aqueduct there

08:15:28.880 --> 08:15:34.560
I feel accomplished because I know I don't have to redo it. It's not gonna get lost

08:15:34.960 --> 08:15:36.640
I'm not gonna have any issues

08:15:37.200 --> 08:15:42.800
Um, but I do understand that people like a challenge in their video games or they might enjoy

08:15:43.760 --> 08:15:45.760
um kind of that

08:15:46.000 --> 08:15:52.080
Aspect of having to fight back for something like you it's not just earned and it's not just that easy

08:15:52.160 --> 08:15:54.160
Like no, you have to fight for it. You have to

08:15:54.800 --> 08:15:58.960
You have a chance to lose that you have an opportunity to get in trouble type thing

08:16:00.080 --> 08:16:03.600
Um, jeez. What was that achievement airstrike maybe?

08:16:04.720 --> 08:16:06.400
um

08:16:06.400 --> 08:16:08.400
I know 73 florans

08:16:09.360 --> 08:16:10.720
eh

08:16:10.720 --> 08:16:14.560
The game's having a rough time right now. I think I'm I'm asking it to do a lot

08:16:15.200 --> 08:16:17.200
Oh, I'm going past the tower. Oh well

08:16:17.760 --> 08:16:22.320
Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello

08:16:23.360 --> 08:16:25.360
America

08:16:26.480 --> 08:16:31.920
Uh, I hate this part with oh my goodness. It's a party on the rooftop, huh?

08:16:33.040 --> 08:16:41.760
Let me get this tower. Ow my back. Hello. You're hitting my clavicle from the back. That's not very nice

08:16:42.640 --> 08:16:44.640
Ah, stop it

08:16:44.960 --> 08:16:49.360
Oh freaking sick. He didn't die. Oh, I need to wait for my recruits to come and help me

08:16:51.680 --> 08:16:57.200
Why why why would you change camera right there game? I'm getting trolled right now

08:16:58.480 --> 08:17:00.480
I think I'm just getting tired as well

08:17:01.680 --> 08:17:03.680
Oh, I love to kill cams

08:17:04.720 --> 08:17:05.840
No

08:17:05.840 --> 08:17:09.360
Off him right. I'm calling in my recruits. They're gonna come help

08:17:10.240 --> 08:17:13.280
As soon as like the AI can pick on someone else

08:17:13.360 --> 08:17:17.840
It just becomes so easy to take them down one by one. Ow my back again

08:17:18.560 --> 08:17:21.440
Would you kindly stop my goodness?

08:17:22.320 --> 08:17:24.320
And I got a thief's guilt for that

08:17:24.640 --> 08:17:26.800
Oh, I've still not done poison. That's a really easy one

08:17:28.000 --> 08:17:32.720
How many okay, I have one bottle of medicine left. I was gonna say I actually don't feel like I've like

08:17:33.360 --> 08:17:35.360
Looted at all

08:17:36.080 --> 08:17:38.080
Hmm

08:17:38.400 --> 08:17:41.520
I've never heard of a scotch video game nerd ran and it's perfect

08:17:42.880 --> 08:17:44.880
Oh, literally like, uh

08:17:45.040 --> 08:17:49.200
Skyrim's probably the next rambly game. I'm gonna play

08:17:50.320 --> 08:17:57.520
Um, and just like tell you like all the things I know about the game and like uh gameplay that I've found interesting or good

08:17:58.880 --> 08:18:00.880
um

08:18:01.120 --> 08:18:04.800
I wouldn't mind playing cult of the lamb again. That was very enjoyable

08:18:05.520 --> 08:18:09.600
Um, I can't yapp about it much though because I'm not I don't know much

08:18:09.600 --> 08:18:13.200
I've only played it once but I really enjoyed it and it was a 10 out of 10

08:18:14.000 --> 08:18:16.000
pardon me experience

08:18:16.480 --> 08:18:21.920
Pardon me for being so rude. It was not me. It was my I have played shadow of mordor

08:18:22.720 --> 08:18:24.880
and

08:18:24.880 --> 08:18:28.240
I haven't like perfectly completed it or anything

08:18:28.720 --> 08:18:31.920
But I would absolutely love to play that again

08:18:32.160 --> 08:18:34.640
I want to give the golem game a shot as well

08:18:35.120 --> 08:18:41.200
It's like such a oh, we got an achievement called tower of fence by the way because we just successfully

08:18:42.080 --> 08:18:43.600
renovate renovate

08:18:43.600 --> 08:18:44.480
um

08:18:44.480 --> 08:18:48.160
destroyed all bourgeois influence on roma

08:18:49.120 --> 08:18:55.280
So now we can successfully renovate everything on the map like on this part of the map. We can like buy everything

08:18:55.920 --> 08:19:00.880
um, so i'm gonna fill up the recruits and uh, we'll buy some

08:19:01.360 --> 08:19:03.360
locations and stuff

08:19:04.480 --> 08:19:07.840
Was it literally everyone hated the golem game, but I'm like

08:19:08.880 --> 08:19:11.280
I mean I assume they've had a few updates

08:19:12.080 --> 08:19:14.080
from the bugs of the game

08:19:15.200 --> 08:19:19.760
Oh, I've got a lot of baby assassins right here. Hmm, right. Oh

08:19:20.880 --> 08:19:26.000
I'll recruit the last assassin wherever they may be. There's no one nearby

08:19:26.560 --> 08:19:31.120
Um, we will start this top corner. Why not?

08:19:32.800 --> 08:19:37.760
Uh, and we'll start renovating unless we do a layer of romulus

08:19:38.720 --> 08:19:40.880
We could maybe do that like now

08:19:42.640 --> 08:19:44.640
I don't mind

08:19:47.680 --> 08:19:51.520
Well, you've been streaming the entire time I've been awake. I've been

08:19:52.320 --> 08:20:01.360
At correction you fool. I've been nerding about my games that I love for eight hours. Haha. You think this is work

08:20:01.760 --> 08:20:03.760
I'll show you work

08:20:05.200 --> 08:20:07.040
Wait, um

08:20:07.040 --> 08:20:12.160
The only reason like I'm able to like do it for so long is because you guys literally listen to me

08:20:12.240 --> 08:20:14.240
Yeah, but about it for so long

08:20:14.800 --> 08:20:18.800
Like it's just a good time. I'm having a good time. Um

08:20:19.360 --> 08:20:23.120
And it's just nice being able to um

08:20:24.800 --> 08:20:28.320
Just share like what I'm passionate about and

08:20:31.760 --> 08:20:38.160
Graphics wise this game looks better than golem like does it actually this game is 14 years old

08:20:40.720 --> 08:20:44.160
Unless yes refling we will fight back

08:20:46.000 --> 08:20:48.000
No more shall we be

08:20:48.240 --> 08:20:50.240
Uh, right hold on

08:20:51.360 --> 08:20:52.640
I don't

08:20:52.640 --> 08:20:56.720
The best way to go about renovating I think is doing the districts

08:20:56.880 --> 08:21:01.760
So we're gonna start with this district first. Okay, so we'll just take it from the top

08:21:02.160 --> 08:21:05.040
And we're gonna buy everything in the game

08:21:05.680 --> 08:21:10.000
I can't believe assassin's creed brotherhood is actually just capitalist simulator

08:21:10.400 --> 08:21:14.320
Because look at us now. We had no money at the start and money begets more money

08:21:14.320 --> 08:21:17.200
You know what I'm saying and don't be confused with baguette

08:21:18.000 --> 08:21:20.160
Beget baguettes as in

08:21:21.040 --> 08:21:23.040
more

08:21:23.600 --> 08:21:26.880
Um, I can't believe this game's just hidden money maker similar

08:21:28.400 --> 08:21:30.400
They've sucked me in

08:21:30.400 --> 08:21:32.400
I like really enjoy money making games

08:21:33.040 --> 08:21:35.040
I just think I'm so fun

08:21:35.600 --> 08:21:36.960
um

08:21:36.960 --> 08:21:38.960
I did want to get into

08:21:40.400 --> 08:21:42.400
Not me game developing

08:21:42.880 --> 08:21:47.120
But me commissioning a game like being a studio

08:21:48.480 --> 08:21:50.000
But I don't know what that's called

08:21:50.000 --> 08:21:57.360
It's not like a publisher because you don't need publishers because publishers are what used to pay for the hard copy of like the xbox games and stuff like that

08:21:58.000 --> 08:21:59.120
um

08:21:59.120 --> 08:22:04.240
Like I might get into that at some point not right now. No, dude. So it's not right now

08:22:05.600 --> 08:22:10.880
Um, like an investor. Yeah, like I will like go to like a gaming

08:22:11.600 --> 08:22:15.600
Um, like developer and be like, hey, do you want to make this?

08:22:16.480 --> 08:22:17.920
um

08:22:17.920 --> 08:22:21.360
And basically they go, yeah, this is how much and I'll be like, okay

08:22:21.840 --> 08:22:27.040
We will do this deal where you get this much and royalties and I get this much like that

08:22:28.560 --> 08:22:30.560
I think it'll be kill

08:22:31.280 --> 08:22:33.280
Make one scrawny

08:22:33.440 --> 08:22:35.440
million dollars

08:22:36.320 --> 08:22:38.320
any

08:22:38.400 --> 08:22:40.400
scrawny stonks

08:22:41.520 --> 08:22:44.080
I could listen to your ample of games for days

08:22:45.040 --> 08:22:46.320
Hmm

08:22:46.320 --> 08:22:48.320
What game ideas do you have in mind?

08:22:48.960 --> 08:22:50.160
Well

08:22:50.160 --> 08:22:57.120
So I really enjoy cookie clicker. However, I don't enjoy the aspect of cookie clicker

08:22:57.760 --> 08:23:04.880
That is the game is so hard to finish and feel like ah, I have achieved the ending of this game

08:23:04.960 --> 08:23:06.240
I am satisfied

08:23:06.240 --> 08:23:08.800
So I wanted to develop a cookie clicker

08:23:09.280 --> 08:23:12.960
That's like a four hour game because because because

08:23:13.840 --> 08:23:20.640
VTubers and streamers need games that kind of wrap up in four hours

08:23:21.200 --> 08:23:25.840
Like I think and I think there's definitely like a market for that kind of thing

08:23:26.320 --> 08:23:31.120
Um, so it'd be very interesting to like find out the formulaic thing in the background

08:23:31.200 --> 08:23:36.080
But obviously you need like more of a twist. You can't just make cookie clicker and then it ends fast like that's not how it works

08:23:36.800 --> 08:23:38.800
uh cookie clicker game

08:23:39.600 --> 08:23:41.600
is a number

08:23:43.280 --> 08:23:44.720
game

08:23:44.720 --> 08:23:45.920
where

08:23:45.920 --> 08:23:50.160
You start with like no money for example or no cookies

08:23:50.800 --> 08:23:54.880
and then you upgrade stuff via the cookies and

08:23:55.440 --> 08:23:59.680
It makes more cookies and the numbers go up. I can't remember the type of game

08:24:00.560 --> 08:24:02.560
it's called

08:24:02.560 --> 08:24:03.920
uh

08:24:03.920 --> 08:24:05.520
incremental game I

08:24:05.520 --> 08:24:07.520
an incremental game

08:24:07.920 --> 08:24:12.880
Is what cookie clicker is and I think there's definitely a market

08:24:13.280 --> 08:24:19.680
For an incremental game that you can wrap up in four hours if it had a storyline of some sort

08:24:20.400 --> 08:24:21.440
um

08:24:21.440 --> 08:24:26.880
As well as like a replayability factor as well. I definitely think

08:24:27.520 --> 08:24:32.880
There's a market for like four hour games, especially for VTubers and streamers and um

08:24:33.840 --> 08:24:38.480
It would definitely be interesting to like go through it together now. I'm definitely nowhere

08:24:39.360 --> 08:24:41.360
near doing any of that and

08:24:42.160 --> 08:24:49.520
Like I don't even know where you start and it just becomes crazy legal stuff and

08:24:50.400 --> 08:24:51.520
uh

08:24:51.520 --> 08:24:59.120
Just to say the development of VLR took over a year and a lot of stress and a lot of like

08:24:59.840 --> 08:25:05.360
Issues on the road like things are not straightforward. It's just impossible

08:25:06.320 --> 08:25:08.320
to be straightforward

08:25:08.320 --> 08:25:13.360
Uh when it comes to these things and I'm not wanting any stress right now

08:25:13.440 --> 08:25:19.680
I just want to enjoy streaming like it took so long to get here. So no, we're not doing VLR

08:25:20.320 --> 08:25:23.200
Uh game development arc. No

08:25:23.920 --> 08:25:26.880
And for the game the free to play game that does come out

08:25:27.600 --> 08:25:29.840
again, it was created by

08:25:30.960 --> 08:25:33.760
Not like an outside source studio

08:25:35.760 --> 08:25:40.080
Type thing. So I guess I've technically already done that. I mean

08:25:41.120 --> 08:25:42.880
This game isn't for profit though

08:25:42.880 --> 08:25:47.200
So I guess like when it comes to like profit games like marketing would have to go into it

08:25:47.280 --> 08:25:49.440
Like all these different factors would have to go into it

08:25:49.760 --> 08:25:56.560
But it's definitely something like I'm happy and open to talk about like especially the newest game that we're developing for VLR right now

08:25:57.120 --> 08:25:58.000
and

08:25:58.000 --> 08:26:04.080
Once it comes out. I'm happy to talk about the development, but I don't think it'll be surprised to anyone to

08:26:04.960 --> 08:26:09.280
For me to not be able to show much of the content of the game

08:26:10.080 --> 08:26:16.160
Oh, I don't think anyone's gonna be surprised. So don't think I'm gonna get like charts out and show like

08:26:16.560 --> 08:26:20.400
These are the mock designs behind the scenes. No

08:26:21.360 --> 08:26:23.360
I can't show that

08:26:24.560 --> 08:26:26.560
It's not appropriate

08:26:28.240 --> 08:26:30.880
Um, yes, it should hopefully come out in july

08:26:31.440 --> 08:26:37.280
Um, it still looks like it is gonna happen in july. So that'll be our big announcement in july

08:26:37.920 --> 08:26:39.920
for be a lower

08:26:40.320 --> 08:26:42.400
And then we start getting to the other stuff

08:26:43.280 --> 08:26:47.040
Just we've linked some vibe and literally there is a lot of lost time

08:26:48.160 --> 08:26:53.520
And yeah, I surely it's uh able to play it on stream. Yeah

08:26:54.400 --> 08:26:56.240
totally

08:26:56.240 --> 08:26:58.240
Yeah

08:26:59.200 --> 08:27:07.280
Yeah, no the game is absolutely fine to be streamed absolutely no issues at all empty faction building

08:27:12.560 --> 08:27:14.560
Mm-hmm

08:27:17.360 --> 08:27:21.360
What platforms um, it's gonna be itchio

08:27:23.200 --> 08:27:25.600
Which is not how anyone reads it, but that's how I read it

08:27:26.160 --> 08:27:29.280
Uh, so we're at the mercenaries location

08:27:29.840 --> 08:27:32.160
So obviously the only logical faction

08:27:33.040 --> 08:27:39.540
For like the mercenaries place like where all the the beefed up macho men are a bit stress relief for the courtesans

08:27:39.620 --> 08:27:41.620
Eh

08:27:41.860 --> 08:27:44.420
I have always put the courtesans here

08:27:45.060 --> 08:27:48.420
Uh, you know, come on these the mercenaries need some

08:27:49.220 --> 08:27:52.980
Some tlc and we'll bear to do that than the courtesans

08:27:55.300 --> 08:27:59.140
Uh, we do have an aqueduct in this area

08:27:59.220 --> 08:28:02.260
I know it's like we've kind of done this little quadrant here as well

08:28:03.140 --> 08:28:05.140
Uh, and we did do that

08:28:05.700 --> 08:28:08.180
maybe we'll like do the outside of the map and then

08:28:09.620 --> 08:28:11.620
Where the heck am I supposed to go?

08:28:14.820 --> 08:28:17.780
Wait, it was highlighted. Why can't I see on my map?

08:28:20.340 --> 08:28:22.340
eto

08:28:23.140 --> 08:28:25.140
Hello, I know

08:28:27.460 --> 08:28:29.460
A brotherhood are you showing your age?

08:28:30.820 --> 08:28:32.660
Oh

08:28:32.660 --> 08:28:37.700
I was bam boozled. It wasn't highlighted properly

08:28:39.780 --> 08:28:42.660
Mercenaries could have been a good mercy fan name

08:28:44.820 --> 08:28:47.700
Would a young dairy have guns like that like

08:28:48.500 --> 08:28:50.260
She'll have gunners

08:28:50.260 --> 08:28:51.700
but guns

08:28:51.700 --> 08:28:53.220
nah

08:28:53.220 --> 08:28:55.220
Yeah

08:28:56.420 --> 08:29:00.020
I could see you doing a game like ducky ducky. I've never played ducky ducky

08:29:00.900 --> 08:29:06.260
I think a lot of youtubers have though. Um, but maybe like I think there's

08:29:07.220 --> 08:29:13.140
Four girls in that game. So maybe uh veal or like reading voice over thing could be a thing

08:29:16.420 --> 08:29:18.420
Hey

08:29:22.820 --> 08:29:29.460
Uh, right we've done this kind of section this one here. So we'll do this bottom corner. Oh, there's Leonardo. We go

08:29:29.780 --> 08:29:31.780
We can purchase the glove

08:29:32.660 --> 08:29:34.900
I need the glove for climbing reasons

08:29:34.980 --> 08:29:36.980
No other reason

08:29:39.620 --> 08:29:42.660
I promise the glove is for wholesome intentions

08:29:44.340 --> 08:29:46.340
And to suggest otherwise

08:29:49.940 --> 08:29:51.940
Wait, aw

08:29:52.260 --> 08:29:56.740
Riding around in my game looking at the sun is so bootyful

08:29:58.180 --> 08:30:00.020
What a beautiful

08:30:00.100 --> 08:30:04.420
Recreation of roma back in back in yield days before the internet became a thing

08:30:07.300 --> 08:30:11.060
But how would uh, how could you stream if you were back then?

08:30:12.660 --> 08:30:17.460
I guess be a stage presence. Excuse me, mr. Horster in the way

08:30:22.340 --> 08:30:27.620
Friendly reminder to not lose sleep. Yeah, if you guys need to rest or you need to go, please don't worry

08:30:28.580 --> 08:30:34.740
Mercy's going live in 30 minutes any mercy modist watchers also known as karambit

08:30:36.020 --> 08:30:42.180
Uh, any karambit warning in 30 minutes, but please do rest if you need to

08:30:43.460 --> 08:30:46.820
Or hydrate to you know, actually I'm going to take a sleep

08:30:48.580 --> 08:30:50.920
Oh, I'm me. Oh, sorry

08:30:51.320 --> 08:30:53.320
Okay

08:30:54.840 --> 08:30:59.960
So you cannot access this viewpoint if you do not repair the aqueduct here

08:31:00.760 --> 08:31:06.760
Which I thought was a pretty neat thing because the game's kind of like hint hint mate. You need to repair stuff

08:31:07.640 --> 08:31:12.920
And then you'll earn income because I'm sure a lot of people kind of played and missed that part of like you can

08:31:13.320 --> 08:31:16.200
Renovate buildings and that's how you get money in the game money

08:31:17.160 --> 08:31:19.160
We

08:31:19.480 --> 08:31:26.600
This game is my second fave before black flag. Yeah black flag certainly captured a lot of people's hearts

08:31:27.320 --> 08:31:29.320
Like oh no

08:31:29.800 --> 08:31:35.640
I forgot it was that jump. I normally struggle to get out of this place so much

08:31:36.840 --> 08:31:39.880
Oh, can I remember how to get out?

08:31:41.080 --> 08:31:43.080
Wait, was it that easy

08:31:43.880 --> 08:31:45.880
to get out

08:31:45.880 --> 08:31:47.880
No

08:31:48.680 --> 08:31:50.680
Yes

08:31:50.680 --> 08:31:51.800
Yes

08:31:51.800 --> 08:31:56.440
Okay, it must have been chilled me because I like never do that like I never go down there

08:31:56.520 --> 08:32:00.520
So it must have been chilled me that really struggled to get out there. I just remember being like

08:32:01.960 --> 08:32:03.960
Back for more designs again

08:32:05.240 --> 08:32:10.760
The Scottish accent making me think differently. What is rest streamer don't

08:32:11.640 --> 08:32:13.640
stream now there we go

08:32:14.600 --> 08:32:23.080
Claim leap glove this reinforced glove allows for faster claiming giving the wearer the strength easily grab handhold many mid-jump

08:32:23.720 --> 08:32:27.960
Handholds mid-jump. It also deals more damage to enemies when fistfading

08:32:30.360 --> 08:32:32.360
Wait here, I'll be back soon

08:32:37.720 --> 08:32:40.680
Yeah, maybe we should get black flag like a really good goal

08:32:41.240 --> 08:32:45.880
Because people seem to just adore it and I've tried it twice to get into it and

08:32:46.680 --> 08:32:49.960
I don't think I beat like an hour now. Nothing will be out of my reach

08:32:50.360 --> 08:32:56.200
No, nothing going bring out on my match. Uh, I think we can oh we can I was gonna say

08:32:56.200 --> 08:32:58.700
I think we can buy the poison darts as well

08:33:05.080 --> 08:33:07.800
I don't know if there's like a sea shanty or anything

08:33:10.840 --> 08:33:14.360
Only a fool could walk past my shop without a decent quick look

08:33:14.920 --> 08:33:16.920
Only a fool

08:33:17.480 --> 08:33:19.480
Night night rest well those who are resting

08:33:21.080 --> 08:33:24.440
Please don't worry about not making it. Uh, I'm very

08:33:25.880 --> 08:33:27.880
I'm very uh, unfriendly

08:33:33.400 --> 08:33:38.680
Uh, right, we're just gonna run buying things. Oh my goodness

08:33:39.640 --> 08:33:46.360
Society all norms. I can't get away from that. I'm such a girl going around buying things man. These gender norms go hands

08:33:47.240 --> 08:33:48.760
ah

08:33:48.760 --> 08:33:52.040
Stop it. Stop it. The gender norms are winning

08:33:53.320 --> 08:33:57.800
Wait, is this the game where you get the wish and well achievement? Oh it is

08:33:58.680 --> 08:34:04.440
I just remembered that holy moly moly. I just remembered that wish and well achievement

08:34:09.400 --> 08:34:13.560
Okay, uh, this looks like a thief's district. So I'll just make it thieves

08:34:19.080 --> 08:34:23.240
Nine thousand florins every

08:34:24.600 --> 08:34:29.000
20 minutes. I'm in the money. Right. I renovated that but it's not

08:34:30.120 --> 08:34:34.520
Updating on the map, but that's okay. And then we'll kind of sweep around these section

08:34:34.680 --> 08:34:38.680
Like maybe we should go outside the map and then in the center. I'm not sure

08:34:42.280 --> 08:34:45.080
There's a war going on for their benefit

08:34:48.040 --> 08:34:52.600
Did you know there's a war going on for their benefit?

08:34:55.240 --> 08:34:58.840
I think odyssey might be my favorite. I didn't get chance to see

08:34:59.320 --> 08:35:03.080
Yeah, I'm you still playing mommy. I mean mommy. I mean mommy

08:35:05.000 --> 08:35:13.960
Yeah, we finished the campaign. So now we are going around and buying everything we can in sight because these gender norms have hands

08:35:14.520 --> 08:35:16.200
um

08:35:16.200 --> 08:35:18.200
But it means

08:35:18.600 --> 08:35:22.680
We are getting more progress to the hundred percent

08:35:23.480 --> 08:35:26.280
For tomorrow because hopefully we can hundred percent the game

08:35:26.280 --> 08:35:30.120
Which is actually crazy because I've never done it before after considering how many times I've played this game

08:35:30.600 --> 08:35:34.120
I I'm going to send my recruits to get a bit stronger because

08:35:35.400 --> 08:35:40.120
They aren't actually all that strong right if I take you

08:35:41.400 --> 08:35:43.400
Can you take some of these?

08:35:43.880 --> 08:35:45.880
Pete maybe

08:35:46.440 --> 08:35:48.440
Do like that

08:35:48.920 --> 08:35:51.480
Do you get hundred and sixty five each?

08:35:53.400 --> 08:35:57.720
You know what that'll still level up her that's just fine

08:35:59.160 --> 08:36:01.320
Level four and then do that

08:36:02.600 --> 08:36:06.200
And that and that and send them away

08:36:07.160 --> 08:36:11.160
And then do a level three mission

08:36:12.200 --> 08:36:15.640
Don't be shy level three mission. I know you're out there

08:36:16.600 --> 08:36:18.600
Don't be scared

08:36:18.760 --> 08:36:24.360
Okay, level one you go with level seven and you share the xp

08:36:25.320 --> 08:36:30.760
And then level three. Yes take two together

08:36:32.120 --> 08:36:34.280
Okay, just take her as well

08:36:35.560 --> 08:36:39.240
And then level one mission off your pulp. Okay. We did it

08:36:40.360 --> 08:36:43.960
Our assassins are all being leveled up and we're getting all the money for

08:36:45.640 --> 08:36:47.640
Oh

08:36:49.160 --> 08:36:54.440
I've been trying to think of a marrow to send you but man excited go ahead. Don't worry. I'm brain dead

08:36:54.440 --> 08:36:56.440
You don't have to be scared of me. Um

08:36:56.920 --> 08:37:03.640
Some people came to get like brain worms or they're like, oh, she's gonna hate me because I said this or I did this one thing

08:37:04.040 --> 08:37:06.040
I'm not like that. Um

08:37:06.360 --> 08:37:11.800
Hopefully if you are nervous and you're just watching and you're just a lurker for now, that's fine

08:37:11.880 --> 08:37:15.960
But hopefully over time you can kind of just see how we're vibing and

08:37:16.520 --> 08:37:21.640
You maybe get the confidence to talk but uh, hi lurkers. It's okay if you're shy

08:37:22.120 --> 08:37:29.720
I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna like call you out or be mean or stinky or anything. It's perfectly fine to be shy and um

08:37:31.080 --> 08:37:36.360
If you're needing to just hang out and have some background noise on I um

08:37:37.160 --> 08:37:39.800
Uh, very thankful that you picked me to be your background

08:37:42.360 --> 08:37:44.360
I

08:37:44.840 --> 08:37:48.680
Like the vibe so far just being child. Yeah, listen. It's casual. You don't have to

08:37:49.320 --> 08:37:53.560
No audience participation necessary. You can be as close as you like

08:37:53.640 --> 08:37:58.280
You can be attached at the hip or you can be an arm's length whatever is comfortable for you

08:37:58.840 --> 08:38:03.560
I'm just happy that you're happy and if you're not happy

08:38:04.120 --> 08:38:05.800
I have five

08:38:05.800 --> 08:38:11.080
Lovely girls who would love to also entertain you in their own special way

08:38:12.040 --> 08:38:16.440
And I would love for you to check them out if you're just like, ah, I don't think this is quite for me

08:38:17.560 --> 08:38:19.560
That's perfectly okay

08:38:19.560 --> 08:38:21.560
perfectly, okay

08:38:22.920 --> 08:38:24.920
Yeah

08:38:25.800 --> 08:38:27.800
You are my oh

08:38:28.440 --> 08:38:32.120
I don't know how I don't know how I

08:38:33.080 --> 08:38:35.080
like just

08:38:35.640 --> 08:38:39.400
The just being so inexperienced and like being so

08:38:39.400 --> 08:38:41.400
Unknowing

08:38:41.880 --> 08:38:47.400
And like you guys are just so overwhelmingly kind to me when you could have

08:38:48.040 --> 08:38:53.000
Could have easily have taken the other avenue of being like

08:38:53.800 --> 08:38:57.160
Oh, this this person hasn't done their research

08:38:57.880 --> 08:39:02.920
Uh, they're just doing it for this reason that reason and instead you just showed me nothing

08:39:03.000 --> 08:39:06.680
but like endless amounts of kindness of patience of like

08:39:07.560 --> 08:39:14.040
Even excitement just to tell me what's what like literally like t s k r

08:39:14.600 --> 08:39:16.600
And I say tisker

08:39:16.680 --> 08:39:20.840
And it becomes like a meme instead of like someone could have easily have just been like

08:39:21.400 --> 08:39:25.160
That's so pathetic. You don't know like the most common phrases

08:39:25.960 --> 08:39:31.880
And like you you guys are just like so kind to be like yeah tisker. We love tisker

08:39:32.040 --> 08:39:37.720
And it's just like such a a good freaking time

08:39:38.760 --> 08:39:42.440
You know, you could have been cancelled for that for a lot

08:39:43.880 --> 08:39:45.240
and

08:39:45.240 --> 08:39:50.680
What if I can't choose between all of you I actually have

08:39:51.880 --> 08:39:55.240
Solution if you can't choose and you're not gonna like it

08:39:56.280 --> 08:39:58.760
And this is terrible of me to say out loud

08:39:59.560 --> 08:40:02.440
But whoever caters to your

08:40:05.560 --> 08:40:08.520
Your willy the most is who you should oh she

08:40:09.400 --> 08:40:11.400
There's no other way to say it

08:40:11.960 --> 08:40:18.280
But whoever caters the most is how you should oh she have your struggle and to pick between us

08:40:22.680 --> 08:40:27.240
Um, yeah, because there's no other way to do it there isn't

08:40:29.720 --> 08:40:32.360
Like come on, you know, I'm telling the truth

08:40:33.400 --> 08:40:38.120
Don't let your brain do your thinking let your head do the thinking

08:40:40.520 --> 08:40:42.520
Why think when your head can do the rest

08:40:43.480 --> 08:40:45.480
Hey

08:40:54.120 --> 08:40:59.480
Another we're at 9.4 k floren's every 20 minutes. Thank you

08:41:01.560 --> 08:41:05.640
Uh, okay, we're getting really close to doing the outskirts fully a got this

08:41:06.520 --> 08:41:12.520
Uh the lair of romulus. Um, I'll try and buy everything. Are you okay?

08:41:13.720 --> 08:41:15.720
Are you okay? Do you need help?

08:41:15.960 --> 08:41:22.840
Oh, she's being chinny. Oh, she's oh, she's calling me over. Yeah, you like the assassin style. Yeah

08:41:24.040 --> 08:41:25.240
Oh

08:41:25.240 --> 08:41:27.240
What's it? Oh

08:41:27.240 --> 08:41:29.240
Oh, she's

08:41:29.240 --> 08:41:32.760
Oh, she's okay. She's at the war. We'll leave it. I don't know what she's doing

08:41:33.560 --> 08:41:40.760
It's really fun to like sit and watch NPCs in this game. Um, um, oh

08:41:41.960 --> 08:41:43.320
Huh

08:41:43.320 --> 08:41:45.560
I've just remembered another achievement

08:41:46.520 --> 08:41:48.520
We'll need to do it where there's enemies

08:41:49.800 --> 08:41:52.120
Because we can't do it here without enemies

08:41:53.160 --> 08:41:55.640
Um, maybe I should get on a horse

08:41:56.360 --> 08:41:59.320
Look at my horse. My horse is amazing

08:41:59.880 --> 08:42:02.840
Yeah, I like oh, it just tastes like raisins

08:42:04.440 --> 08:42:06.840
There's that hole. I can't remember

08:42:09.560 --> 08:42:11.560
She's washing your feet

08:42:12.840 --> 08:42:14.120
Oh

08:42:14.120 --> 08:42:16.120
Honestly hashtag spoiled

08:42:17.800 --> 08:42:22.440
What nice lady I didn't even tip her should I go back and tip her? No

08:42:24.840 --> 08:42:26.840
Spain it's fine

08:42:27.560 --> 08:42:28.760
Oh

08:42:28.760 --> 08:42:31.720
polishing your shoes, whatever. Yeah my my uh

08:42:32.760 --> 08:42:37.480
Ah, what's the name of the armored shoes if I go to the the the um

08:42:38.760 --> 08:42:42.120
Blacksmith and keep going. It's not enough money

08:42:44.360 --> 08:42:47.240
Oh my goodness I've blown through the veal or budget

08:42:48.040 --> 08:42:50.040
Quick get me to the bank

08:42:50.280 --> 08:42:52.280
Get me to the bank. Where's the bank?

08:42:52.280 --> 08:42:54.280
Get me to the bank

08:42:54.280 --> 08:42:56.280
Get me to the bank

08:42:56.520 --> 08:43:00.600
Right mr. Banker. I have a really good idea. We take

08:43:01.320 --> 08:43:02.920
Five girls

08:43:02.920 --> 08:43:06.040
Okay with me and we do really cute streams

08:43:06.600 --> 08:43:07.880
Okay

08:43:07.880 --> 08:43:11.880
And we get to nerd about our games that we really like and we get to have a good time together

08:43:12.280 --> 08:43:15.480
Are you in or out mr. Banker? How much will you invest?

08:43:16.280 --> 08:43:18.680
Tell us how much is it gonna invest lads?

08:43:18.680 --> 08:43:27.480
14 000 okay, I'll take it. I'll take it. He invested 14 000 better than none

08:43:28.280 --> 08:43:30.840
Better than none. Right. Let's let's renovate the stable right now

08:43:32.600 --> 08:43:36.360
I'm all in 50 trillion dollars

08:43:38.280 --> 08:43:40.280
Let's bet everything

08:43:42.840 --> 08:43:46.440
I quit years I quit or you're getting stabbed

08:43:49.000 --> 08:43:51.480
In order to avoid this heinous act

08:43:52.840 --> 08:43:58.120
Okay, um, we're getting close and maybe we won't do landmarks landmarks are

08:43:59.080 --> 08:44:00.760
insanely expensive

08:44:00.760 --> 08:44:02.760
We might maybe it's better to do these

08:44:03.400 --> 08:44:12.520
See the landmarks all come together here like in between these like five is oh, yeah five is like 100 000 florins

08:44:14.680 --> 08:44:17.080
Now don't get me wrong the banks make money but

08:44:18.040 --> 08:44:20.040
nine

08:44:20.600 --> 08:44:22.440
Nine squillion

08:44:22.440 --> 08:44:26.360
Florin nine thousand squillion florins isn't gonna do it. You're gonna cut it

08:44:27.080 --> 08:44:33.160
So we can't invest just take on them a blank check. Oh don't mind the bad

08:44:37.480 --> 08:44:40.600
Uh, uh, you ready for this achievement?

08:44:43.480 --> 08:44:45.480
Thank you very much

08:44:45.640 --> 08:44:47.640
Ready

08:44:47.720 --> 08:44:49.720
steady

08:44:52.600 --> 08:44:54.600
Spring cleaning feet on with the broom

08:44:55.880 --> 08:44:57.880
Can I parry with a broom?

08:44:57.880 --> 08:44:58.920
Ah

08:44:58.920 --> 08:45:00.600
pocket sand

08:45:00.600 --> 08:45:03.800
You can parry with our broom. How does it not break?

08:45:09.160 --> 08:45:13.720
Achievement name clean sweep. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

08:45:14.440 --> 08:45:23.240
That's what I'm talking about. What's that? You're too small enough to remember the secret achievements. Uh, yeah, what do you mean? You're not

08:45:24.520 --> 08:45:26.520
Oh my god, you're not hashtag as

08:45:27.480 --> 08:45:33.800
In love with this game. I'm just kidding. It's not a competition of who knows more about the video game

08:45:33.880 --> 08:45:38.120
If you enjoy your video game, that's fantastic. We ain't here trying to give you a quiz

08:45:38.760 --> 08:45:41.720
To prove that you've played the video game. That's not how it works out here

08:45:42.680 --> 08:45:44.680
Not from around here

08:45:47.800 --> 08:45:51.960
Oh, my assassin recruits gave me tons of money as well. I already forgot that part

08:45:57.240 --> 08:45:59.720
Do your business with them and broom them fast

08:46:05.320 --> 08:46:11.080
Is it possible to beat the whole game using a broom, uh, no because it won't spawn in all locations

08:46:12.680 --> 08:46:18.040
Uh, you cannot do it in all locations. Take a little sip of water

08:46:23.400 --> 08:46:24.680
Oh

08:46:24.680 --> 08:46:29.240
Mercy going live in 10 minutes. Mercy going live in 10 minutes

08:46:30.520 --> 08:46:32.680
Did mercy's fine name?

08:46:35.640 --> 08:46:37.880
Mercy's fine name snippets

08:46:38.440 --> 08:46:47.160
10 minute warning to all snippets. I repeat 10 minute warning for all snippets showtime is upon you

08:46:52.760 --> 08:46:57.800
Uh, I always struggle to get out of the section of the game. You know what? I'm I'm gonna just jump down the hill

08:46:58.120 --> 08:47:00.600
I'll just do it and I'll call the horse a bit later on

08:47:01.240 --> 08:47:03.240
Hee hee

08:47:04.200 --> 08:47:07.320
I really wet your whistle. I do need to wet my whistle

08:47:08.200 --> 08:47:12.280
Did you know in Alice Madness Return the old lady says wet your whistle

08:47:12.360 --> 08:47:17.320
And it used to scare me so much when I played that game. I used to be terrified of Alice Madness Return

08:47:18.920 --> 08:47:22.040
You know, I'm starting to think I'm just a scaredy cat altogether. You know that

08:47:23.320 --> 08:47:25.320
I think I'm just just a little scaredy cat

08:47:27.480 --> 08:47:29.480
Right, let's just buy this

08:47:29.480 --> 08:47:31.480
Oh

08:47:33.320 --> 08:47:40.600
Wait, please give mercy my company allocated a mental well. Okay. Good night. Ha ha. No

08:47:44.760 --> 08:47:50.040
No, not American McGee's Alice. I I tried to play it. I suck

08:47:51.000 --> 08:47:54.520
And not the good kind. I just was not good at that game

08:47:55.240 --> 08:47:59.400
I got stuck at the very start on the three-door portal thing

08:47:59.800 --> 08:48:03.880
I don't know my game was bugging out or I was just too dumb, but I am very dumb

08:48:03.960 --> 08:48:06.280
So that's the most plausible answer

08:48:09.240 --> 08:48:14.440
Hi, Johnny. Oh wait, sorry. I just said hi. Johnny is if I was saying your name. Hi, babe

08:48:16.280 --> 08:48:19.000
Congrats on doing it. Uh, congrats on you

08:48:21.240 --> 08:48:23.240
How how you doing?

08:48:25.240 --> 08:48:31.320
I can't believe I said that. Hi, Johnny. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Johnny's me

08:48:34.520 --> 08:48:39.800
We're playing uh, thanks for saying congrats on doing it. Uh, thanks for watching us

08:48:41.160 --> 08:48:45.960
Yumi plus was literally one of the only agents one of two agencies that responded

08:48:46.920 --> 08:48:52.040
Uh, no, I tell a lie. There was a third agency, but due to taming it could not be possible

08:48:52.440 --> 08:49:00.440
But um, there is very likely to be a third agency as well that we will interact with a lot because they were kind enough to give us the time of day

08:49:01.240 --> 08:49:03.240
And I'm definitely a

08:49:03.720 --> 08:49:07.480
Someone that's like if you scratch our back we'll scratch yours, you know

08:49:07.880 --> 08:49:10.760
Like if you give me the time of day, I'll give you the time of day

08:49:11.640 --> 08:49:15.400
Anyway, that's that's just my two cents. Anyway, that's just my two cents

08:49:15.880 --> 08:49:27.480
I just said yumi plus like a dumbass you're being you

08:49:28.760 --> 08:49:32.680
Sorry, there's a few girls from yumi plus that came in and I have been

08:49:33.080 --> 08:49:37.640
Streaming for almost nine hours. So my brain is getting out there. But yes, thank you

08:49:38.120 --> 08:49:43.080
It made again. I apologize from b and u not from yumi plus. I apologize

08:49:43.880 --> 08:49:47.080
I'm I'm uh getting a bit h2 delirious

08:49:47.800 --> 08:49:50.040
At the moment just because I love I've been playing

08:49:51.000 --> 08:49:53.000
But me love me love

08:49:54.040 --> 08:49:58.760
Prit me praying I say your name right? I like when my accent does it change? But no, I don't

08:50:00.680 --> 08:50:02.680
Uh, I'm actually gonna

08:50:04.440 --> 08:50:06.440
Don't want to hear

08:50:07.640 --> 08:50:09.640
Aren't you supposed to be the one

08:50:10.520 --> 08:50:12.760
Aren't you supposed to be the one with a mushy brain?

08:50:13.320 --> 08:50:15.160
Yeah

08:50:15.160 --> 08:50:18.920
Did you know my biggest weaknesses are mirrors?

08:50:19.640 --> 08:50:23.000
And I can't wait to be close, but it's terrible, but it's true

08:50:25.560 --> 08:50:29.560
Is it terrible to tell the truth? I don't know maybe

08:50:30.920 --> 08:50:32.920
Maybe baby

08:50:34.360 --> 08:50:36.360
If you tell them the truth

08:50:36.920 --> 08:50:38.120
I

08:50:38.120 --> 08:50:43.080
Was juggling three debut watch along the whole time. It's a wild ride. Wait, did other people debut on?

08:50:43.800 --> 08:50:46.200
Or do you mean? Oh, do you mean their watch along? Yes?

08:50:46.360 --> 08:50:50.760
You said the word watch along and then my brain completely went over that. That's exactly what you said

08:50:50.840 --> 08:50:53.560
Yeah, that makes much more sense than what I was originally reading

08:50:54.600 --> 08:50:56.600
Gee willikers. I'm losing the plot

08:50:58.440 --> 08:51:02.280
Right, uh, we've kind we're gonna ignore these big buildings

08:51:02.760 --> 08:51:06.280
Um, these cost a lot of money money. We do not have at the moment

08:51:07.080 --> 08:51:10.200
Uh, all the funds went into developing the girls sorry tihi

08:51:12.600 --> 08:51:16.600
We've arrived at seems great now want to see stormy looking in the mirror, which all that

08:51:18.520 --> 08:51:20.760
Uh, someone suggested it and I'm like

08:51:22.520 --> 08:51:26.680
Um, because like one of my like top 10 is like

08:51:28.040 --> 08:51:30.040
Lost

08:51:30.040 --> 08:51:35.000
Um, and I was like, it's literally perfect. It's like too perfect

08:51:36.360 --> 08:51:41.640
Um, could you hit the size on yourself in a mirror only by accident like I wouldn't do it on purpose

08:51:42.200 --> 08:51:44.200
It would be like an accident thing

08:51:47.320 --> 08:51:53.160
I cannot wait to like do the donathon because I have so many panel like comic strip ideas

08:51:53.880 --> 08:51:58.760
Um, if you've seen the one posted on twitter, um

08:52:00.600 --> 08:52:07.400
Uh, that kind of panel comic stuff thing. I love it. I love it with my tongue out

08:52:08.200 --> 08:52:09.800
of it

08:52:09.800 --> 08:52:14.520
Cannot get enough of that like like one shot dojin type things

08:52:15.960 --> 08:52:25.240
I just adore it right um, we're gonna do this viewpoint here. It's not too finicky now that we have the glove. It's not

08:52:26.360 --> 08:52:29.080
Did I not just select that viewpoint?

08:52:31.000 --> 08:52:34.040
I did select the viewpoint, but I guess I did it so fast

08:52:35.000 --> 08:52:37.000
Um, but yeah

08:52:37.480 --> 08:52:39.480
how would

08:52:39.560 --> 08:52:42.440
Get out of him it just wears awful retain like my

08:52:43.080 --> 08:52:46.920
Like my preference for like hypnosis is like it doesn't last forever

08:52:47.240 --> 08:52:50.920
but I have recorded an audio that removes like any

08:52:51.720 --> 08:52:53.240
um

08:52:53.240 --> 08:52:58.680
Effects that I may have given you because I have gone the finger snapping route

08:52:59.240 --> 08:53:02.680
Um, I quite like the finger snap in both ears

08:53:03.240 --> 08:53:04.920
um

08:53:04.920 --> 08:53:06.920
That's just me personally though

08:53:07.400 --> 08:53:10.760
Um, and I also like the banyuril

08:53:11.400 --> 08:53:15.560
repeated uh under for subliminal angle as well

08:53:16.040 --> 08:53:19.960
So I've kind of like done that route, but that's just for me and uh,

08:53:20.680 --> 08:53:23.640
You know, hopefully people enjoy it very new

08:53:23.720 --> 08:53:29.720
But I just kind of did what I like because I find if I do what I like

08:53:30.200 --> 08:53:32.700
Things come out very enjoyable

08:53:33.960 --> 08:53:40.440
Uh overall whereas like if I kind of feel like forced it's like I doesn't really come out of the way I wanted it to come across

08:53:40.520 --> 08:53:42.120
You know

08:53:42.120 --> 08:53:44.120
This is just a viewpoint

08:53:44.840 --> 08:53:47.400
Uh, aren't you going to condition as well?

08:53:47.400 --> 08:53:52.520
That's why I've recorded an audio to undo it at any point. So if

08:53:53.320 --> 08:53:55.880
You don't want to experience it anymore from me

08:53:56.600 --> 08:54:03.720
Uh, you can definitely listen to it and undo all the thing because you got to be safe when you do hypnosis

08:54:04.200 --> 08:54:06.200
I did my research

08:54:06.680 --> 08:54:09.960
And definitely got to be safe got to make sure you're safe

08:54:10.680 --> 08:54:14.600
And all that jazz so yeah, but uh, I don't really do anything

08:54:15.560 --> 08:54:16.680
um

08:54:16.680 --> 08:54:18.280
very

08:54:18.280 --> 08:54:24.680
Out there um when it comes to the bit mnosis community a lot of things are

08:54:25.480 --> 08:54:26.600
very

08:54:26.600 --> 08:54:28.360
Like

08:54:28.360 --> 08:54:30.360
In that and I'm not really

08:54:30.360 --> 08:54:32.360
Going that route

08:54:33.400 --> 08:54:38.360
Doesn't mean I'll I'll never say never never say never because I do like try in my hand and like everything

08:54:38.440 --> 08:54:40.440
I'm kind of like a finger in the pies

08:54:40.920 --> 08:54:45.160
Um, I just love kind of challenging myself like that newest audio

08:54:45.640 --> 08:54:47.640
Uh, I have never really

08:54:47.880 --> 08:54:53.560
Uh done anything to that degree before I was about to jump off there. Yeah, you won't hey bell. That's fine. Um

08:54:54.760 --> 08:54:58.600
I have never done that kind of audio before

08:54:59.320 --> 08:55:05.400
But I enjoyed doing it even though it's not like an interest of mine personally because it was a challenge

08:55:05.480 --> 08:55:11.960
It was something I had to like go out there and learn about right. Okay. What aspects do people like about this particular thing?

08:55:12.360 --> 08:55:14.280
Okay, I'm going to incorporate it this way

08:55:14.280 --> 08:55:17.800
I've seen from like this video that I'm researching they did it this way

08:55:17.880 --> 08:55:23.560
But I don't have a preference that way. I'd rather it be this way like I like that kind of challenge

08:55:24.200 --> 08:55:26.600
um for me personally um

08:55:27.800 --> 08:55:30.440
Which um, I like variety

08:55:31.160 --> 08:55:36.840
Um, and all that good stuff. Sorry. I'm Emily. I'm kind of a bit passionate about that stuff too

08:55:37.240 --> 08:55:39.240
But we can talk about it at a later time

08:55:40.200 --> 08:55:42.200
I don't mind

08:55:43.560 --> 08:55:45.560
Yeah

08:55:46.600 --> 08:55:49.880
But yes, that's kind of my thing um, mercy

08:55:51.640 --> 08:55:53.320
Snip it

08:55:53.320 --> 08:55:55.320
Call out in three minutes

08:55:55.800 --> 08:55:57.000
mods

08:55:57.000 --> 08:56:04.360
You are given permission to link the stream once she goes live and then you're unpromissioned to talk. No, you're too quick

08:56:05.080 --> 08:56:09.800
You're too quick once she goes live unless she's live. Is she live? She might be live

08:56:11.080 --> 08:56:13.080
She's probably already alive

08:56:13.080 --> 08:56:14.120
um

08:56:14.120 --> 08:56:17.160
Okay, we're gonna do this section. This is actually quite a big section

08:56:17.560 --> 08:56:19.560
Like you can see these contract missions

08:56:19.800 --> 08:56:24.060
They go away as soon as you do them so we can 100% like do that, but we'll go for renovation

08:56:27.640 --> 08:56:29.640
um

08:56:29.800 --> 08:56:31.320
Yes

08:56:31.320 --> 08:56:34.760
I am new for anyone who's like I can't wait to hear your stuff

08:56:35.480 --> 08:56:38.120
Please give me the benefit of the doubt. It's like we kind of

08:56:38.840 --> 08:56:41.160
You know get into it because

08:56:42.520 --> 08:56:48.120
I'm new but I am passionate. I've actually always had a thing for it, but I've never

08:56:49.560 --> 08:56:51.880
The problem is I needed to research it

08:56:52.040 --> 08:56:55.080
But the rabbit hole gets so so deep

08:56:55.560 --> 08:56:58.680
Like the first thing I learned was like the safety thing

08:56:58.760 --> 08:57:03.960
Like I need to do an audio that reverts anything that I might have given someone

08:57:04.680 --> 08:57:06.680
um

08:57:07.400 --> 08:57:13.880
Like that was like the first major thing I learned and then the things were like the conditioning like what's your condition thing going to be

08:57:14.360 --> 08:57:16.360
and I personally like

08:57:16.360 --> 08:57:18.360
um

08:57:18.520 --> 08:57:24.840
Double whispering is what I call it and snapping fingers and both ears like fine neural

08:57:24.840 --> 08:57:28.280
It has to be by neural. It can't just be mono like in the center

08:57:29.000 --> 08:57:32.360
Um, I like that. So I've incorporated that

08:57:34.680 --> 08:57:36.680
It's almost 5 a.m. I should

08:57:36.760 --> 08:57:40.040
Uh get back to the reason I'm pulling on all night our oopsies

08:57:40.520 --> 08:57:44.120
Please rise well. Thank you for hanging. I apologize for taking on your sleep

08:57:47.240 --> 08:57:51.160
Yeah, I like subliminal whispers as well that are by neural

08:57:52.200 --> 08:57:58.680
Oh, I love it, but my goodness golly does it add to the overall like

08:57:59.720 --> 08:58:02.680
Duration of how long it takes to make an audio, but that's fine

08:58:03.160 --> 08:58:08.520
Like if it's a passion project type thing just a small sting and my enemies would fall

08:58:08.920 --> 08:58:14.840
Okay, we've just unlocked poison darts, which are fantastic. I'm a bit late to the story considering

08:58:15.800 --> 08:58:22.600
Uh, actually we need to poison five guards in order to do a mission for not mission

08:58:24.440 --> 08:58:29.400
Uh, you can like oh, he saw me. He saw me. Oh man. He caught me. Oh

08:58:30.280 --> 08:58:33.320
Can you stop my good? I really wish

08:58:35.880 --> 08:58:38.280
Oh, fine. We're just gonna grab his weapon. Oh

08:58:39.240 --> 08:58:43.320
Well, we can also do that. I guess jeez. Let me heal up

08:58:45.800 --> 08:58:47.800
What was my awakening

08:58:48.920 --> 08:58:53.000
The jungle book muggle the snake scene in the jungle book

08:58:53.880 --> 08:58:56.040
Which is terrible, but it's

08:58:58.920 --> 08:59:05.240
I was just kind of like oh wait, wait, wait. Why did I really like this like really like this?

08:59:05.960 --> 08:59:07.960
I

08:59:10.920 --> 08:59:12.920
Right did I get more poison

08:59:15.400 --> 08:59:18.760
I'm listening to stream. Anyways, luckily I had to open another tab where we got taken down, but

08:59:19.400 --> 08:59:24.680
Uh, this and I got asleep. Yeah, please rest. Well, don't worry. Uh, I'm benchy. I don't know my

08:59:25.480 --> 08:59:29.960
My streams are very long. It's quite hard to stay up unless you like wake up at the same time as me

08:59:29.960 --> 08:59:33.400
Go to sleep at the same time as me. It's a bit hard for my endurance streams

08:59:33.400 --> 08:59:39.240
But I don't always do endurance streams like I've got needy streamer overload that way a short one the hand cam stream will be a short one

08:59:40.680 --> 08:59:42.120
Um

08:59:42.120 --> 08:59:45.800
How many hours is this I've probably got like one more hour

08:59:46.760 --> 08:59:53.160
I'm just gonna try and buy all the buildings and then tomorrow we can tackle the layer

08:59:53.640 --> 08:59:59.320
Of romulus and I can show you the armor, which I really like we'll get a big armor upgrade

09:00:00.040 --> 09:00:02.040
Um

09:00:03.320 --> 09:00:05.800
And leonardo missions and then

09:00:06.840 --> 09:00:12.280
We try and hundred percent the game for the dna sequence, which I'm very nervous about because I've never done it before

09:00:12.280 --> 09:00:18.120
And someone said the tank mission and I was like the tank mission and they were like, yeah the tank mission

09:00:18.360 --> 09:00:20.360
And now I am scared of the tank mission

09:00:21.720 --> 09:00:27.000
Because I don't know what the hundred percent is on it and I'm terrified

09:00:27.240 --> 09:00:32.920
Uh, I think I'm gonna poison those guards, which sounds really mean

09:00:33.880 --> 09:00:35.880
Yeah

09:00:35.880 --> 09:00:38.280
So is it more about being in controllers at more of a

09:00:39.000 --> 09:00:43.000
Thing I definitely go both ways with my interest in hypnosis

09:00:43.720 --> 09:00:44.840
um

09:00:44.840 --> 09:00:46.840
I do like the idea of being like

09:00:47.400 --> 09:00:51.640
It backfires. I really enjoy the idea of it backfire. We're just gonna

09:00:57.400 --> 09:00:59.400
No

09:01:06.680 --> 09:01:11.480
Okay, we did it we poisoned all those guards. Oh, they're beating each other up. Oh

09:01:14.200 --> 09:01:17.720
Oh, they jump in him hydration check

09:01:20.280 --> 09:01:23.720
You really like mirrors, huh backfire. Yes

09:01:24.360 --> 09:01:28.840
Um, so I like the concept that my like hypnosis that I'm supposed to do on you

09:01:29.480 --> 09:01:34.120
Um, like backfires on me like if I look at a shiny object or reflective objects

09:01:35.240 --> 09:01:37.240
Like I like that that's

09:01:39.080 --> 09:01:43.320
But I do like the idea of being in control and like

09:01:44.040 --> 09:01:47.480
Telling you what to do because like that kind of power is

09:01:48.200 --> 09:01:51.320
Like insane that power feels like

09:01:54.120 --> 09:01:58.920
I know that's not even like a word or anything, but like it just feels very like

09:02:00.840 --> 09:02:02.840
Hot in here

09:02:02.920 --> 09:02:05.080
Because it's like, what do you mean I'm in control of you?

09:02:06.120 --> 09:02:08.120
I'm just an echo

09:02:10.360 --> 09:02:13.640
Oh, how the turntables basically I enjoy that too. Yeah

09:02:15.880 --> 09:02:17.080
In

09:02:17.080 --> 09:02:21.880
But I definitely need to do like more research like secret subject has been fantastic

09:02:22.360 --> 09:02:24.920
If you didn't know like secret subject like has done

09:02:25.800 --> 09:02:27.800
uh, like reports

09:02:28.200 --> 09:02:29.880
and

09:02:29.880 --> 09:02:30.920
and

09:02:30.920 --> 09:02:32.680
like essays

09:02:32.680 --> 09:02:35.480
and just like explains like stuff on

09:02:37.640 --> 09:02:40.200
Oh, I don't have enough money

09:02:42.440 --> 09:02:44.440
I spent it all

09:02:44.440 --> 09:02:49.960
Goodness gracious, right hydration system secret subject mentioned. Yeah, I love secret subject

09:02:52.200 --> 09:02:54.200
Oh

09:02:58.360 --> 09:03:00.360
Yeah, it's like she

09:03:00.920 --> 09:03:03.800
Is just so oh, we made a living cave right where's a bank

09:03:04.440 --> 09:03:10.840
Like she is just like doesn't gay keep like, um, she actually quote tweeted me on

09:03:11.480 --> 09:03:13.880
Twitter which sent like a bunch of followers

09:03:14.680 --> 09:03:18.760
Um, and she was like just so happy. There was another hypno beach of her and I'm like

09:03:19.640 --> 09:03:21.640
I hope I don't disappoint her

09:03:23.160 --> 09:03:24.600
Um

09:03:24.600 --> 09:03:31.240
Just like I hope she's like oh like a secret subject has never given any indication of being like a mean person at all

09:03:31.240 --> 09:03:33.960
and I would never ever think that um

09:03:35.240 --> 09:03:42.520
I just hope like no one thinks like on the hypno side of things like I'm a poser like I'm just someone who genuinely does have an interest

09:03:42.600 --> 09:03:44.600
I'm just not well versed

09:03:45.080 --> 09:03:47.720
And like I'm at the learning stages of things

09:03:48.440 --> 09:03:49.800
um

09:03:49.800 --> 09:03:51.480
and like

09:03:51.480 --> 09:03:55.080
Again, just like as long as you've got some patience for me

09:03:55.640 --> 09:04:02.520
Uh, like every time I do something I'll gain more experience. I'll gain more understanding. I'll see the feedback back. Sorry

09:04:03.160 --> 09:04:07.080
Um, and just overall have like a really it says down

09:04:08.040 --> 09:04:10.040
The map says down

09:04:11.320 --> 09:04:13.320
Pardon me, sorry

09:04:13.480 --> 09:04:15.480
Um

09:04:18.680 --> 09:04:23.480
No, I'm like so appreciative for like secret for just like not even being interested in

09:04:24.280 --> 09:04:26.600
like gatekeeping isn't like a word but

09:04:27.400 --> 09:04:34.840
Being so interested in what she does and being so passionate about what she does that she willingly shares and educates

09:04:35.480 --> 09:04:37.480
Like it's just so nice

09:04:37.480 --> 09:04:39.480
You know

09:04:39.960 --> 09:04:41.960
Are

09:04:42.520 --> 09:04:44.520
You going to once at this game? Oh

09:04:45.640 --> 09:04:51.720
Uh, do we tell you that we already finished the campaign and we're now just doing renovations on the buildings on the map

09:04:52.920 --> 09:04:56.440
We may have already finished the campaign

09:04:57.240 --> 09:04:59.240
Hmm

09:05:04.840 --> 09:05:10.520
Why do you care so much about what other men are doing? I don't understand what that means

09:05:12.040 --> 09:05:14.520
Sorry, you're gonna have to rephrase that I don't understand

09:05:19.480 --> 09:05:21.480
That was way too fast. Oh, yeah

09:05:23.080 --> 09:05:25.080
You finished it like an hour ago

09:05:25.160 --> 09:05:29.000
Yeah, I'm just trying to buy everything like renovation wise

09:05:29.720 --> 09:05:30.840
and

09:05:30.840 --> 09:05:32.680

I'm actually literally landlord simulator right now. Like this city owns me so much money

Oh, mercy's definitely up by now. If you're a snippet or want to give mercy modest also known as

Slava thought if she was slavic and that's absolutely

09:06:02.520 --> 09:06:04.520
outrageous name

09:06:06.520 --> 09:06:10.680
Racial emotivated name unironically that's absolutely atrocious. Um

09:06:11.720 --> 09:06:17.240
Then she is live and she is playing killer seven if my memory serves me correct

So, please do check out mercy. Uh, right now. We're literally just rambling and renovating

Yapping inland lord and honestly by nightfall she will own the city

Look at him. He's so mad at me because he dropped his box and it disappeared into nothing

09:08:24.360 --> 09:08:30.760
There's the doctor over here doctor doctor I miss it. What was that song 10?

09:08:32.680 --> 09:08:36.520
Five monkeys jumping on a bed one fell off and bumped their head

09:08:37.080 --> 09:08:41.800
Wait, is there doctor mentioned first came love? No, right. My brain is just crossing everything right now

09:08:43.560 --> 09:08:50.440
Is that the same tune? Okay. Yes, I signed the first came love second come marriage third comes baby in the golden carriage

09:08:52.600 --> 09:08:55.560
Okay, empty faction building and coming for you

09:08:56.680 --> 09:08:59.480
Oh 13 out of 15 medical shops

09:09:00.360 --> 09:09:02.840
Renovated we getting close

09:09:03.560 --> 09:09:09.000
Um, I I'm actually going to send my recruits away again because they're the money makers and

09:09:09.960 --> 09:09:12.200
The money pile is getting smaller and smaller

09:09:13.880 --> 09:09:15.880
Haram beat was

09:09:16.520 --> 09:09:18.760
I know I wasn't Haram. It was Karam

09:09:19.560 --> 09:09:21.560
I think I don't know I'm Karam's

09:09:21.960 --> 09:09:23.960
Karam nice and easy to

09:09:24.200 --> 09:09:26.200
Money money money

09:09:26.600 --> 09:09:28.600
It must be funny

09:09:29.000 --> 09:09:31.000
In a rich man's world

09:09:32.760 --> 09:09:34.760
Oh

09:09:37.720 --> 09:09:43.160
All the things I could do if I had a wee bit money

09:09:44.200 --> 09:09:46.200
Must be funny

09:09:46.920 --> 09:09:48.600
A little bit delirious

09:09:48.600 --> 09:09:49.800
That's okay

09:09:49.800 --> 09:09:52.520
Uh, right what we're doing four. Let's do four

09:09:53.480 --> 09:09:57.560
You level up you guys because you guys are pretty weak sauce

09:09:59.560 --> 09:10:03.000
A hundred xp is not good

09:10:05.400 --> 09:10:07.400
For you

09:10:10.280 --> 09:10:12.280
Right I like those odds

09:10:15.240 --> 09:10:17.240
How did this turn into

09:10:17.400 --> 09:10:19.400
Vantian business taken?

09:10:19.800 --> 09:10:22.280
It's literally just like a side part of the game

09:10:23.160 --> 09:10:27.800
Um, I just kind of like comes out and over honestly, uh, like send them all off

09:10:28.600 --> 09:10:31.560
Money money money money money money money money

09:10:46.600 --> 09:10:48.600
Okay, well just do that

09:10:49.400 --> 09:10:55.480
For them. They're unfortunately a bit too weak. I'm just gonna safely send them all together

09:10:55.480 --> 09:10:59.080
I don't want anyone to perish at this stage because everyone's getting pretty leveled up at this point

09:10:59.640 --> 09:11:05.000
And uh, okay. I've got 12k for doing that. That's fantastic. Uh, right. Okay. We're gonna renovate this

09:11:05.080 --> 09:11:12.360
We're gonna look at this view point. There's 24 view points in brotherhood and the borja tower's total

09:11:12.600 --> 09:11:14.600
I believe is

09:11:18.200 --> 09:11:20.200
10 no 12

09:11:21.560 --> 09:11:23.960
Maybe 12 maybe 11

09:11:24.920 --> 09:11:28.200
Mmm, so already 11 view points have been

09:11:29.960 --> 09:11:31.960
Uh dealt with

09:11:32.600 --> 09:11:34.600
Is this where I'm supposed to go?

09:11:34.600 --> 09:11:38.680
Hello. Hello. Can I purchase you? I would like one courtesan tree

09:11:40.600 --> 09:11:45.480
I do have the stamina to still be playing I love my video games and I love yapping

09:11:46.600 --> 09:11:48.600
So I may or may not

09:11:48.760 --> 09:11:50.760
Still be here

09:11:51.160 --> 09:11:56.680
Um, I think I'll try and buy everything on the map and then once I've done that and

09:11:57.640 --> 09:11:59.960
I think we'll retire for the evening

09:12:01.080 --> 09:12:03.080
possibly

09:12:03.880 --> 09:12:07.160
Or do we just go for it and send it? I don't know. How are we at?

09:12:08.120 --> 09:12:13.960
We're at nine hours. So we technically have three hours before the vod starts

09:12:15.080 --> 09:12:18.040
And feeling a bit special

09:12:19.000 --> 09:12:24.840
So, I mean maybe my first game stream could be 12 hours

09:12:27.080 --> 09:12:30.120
Hmm me honestly

09:12:32.200 --> 09:12:35.000
Honestly for I'm feeling all right right now

09:12:35.800 --> 09:12:40.280
Like I'm feeling out where the heck am I supposed to go? Am I supposed to do this thing? No, I'm not. Is that building?

09:12:41.560 --> 09:12:43.560
um

09:12:43.560 --> 09:12:48.200
Absolutely legendary feat. Oh, yeah, like I just love the game

09:12:48.520 --> 09:12:50.520
Uh, obviously

09:12:50.520 --> 09:12:57.320
The company of the reeflings make it absolutely fantastic being able to just blab about this game and

09:12:57.960 --> 09:13:02.840
Ramble away about anything and everything. What the heck am I supposed to be doing here? I supposed to jump on the

09:13:03.320 --> 09:13:06.440
That can be right up like this. No

09:13:07.400 --> 09:13:09.400
Must be that one then

09:13:10.440 --> 09:13:12.280
um

09:13:12.280 --> 09:13:15.320
Okay, yeah, there we go. Um like

09:13:17.320 --> 09:13:20.120
No, I won't say that that's not nice. That's not kind

09:13:21.640 --> 09:13:24.120
Um 12 hours that's impressed. Yeah

09:13:24.760 --> 09:13:29.400
Please understand if I hate the game I'm spending 12 hours on it

09:13:30.760 --> 09:13:35.400
The fact that I have much stamina right now is because I absolutely adore this game

09:13:35.720 --> 09:13:38.120
And I'm so glad I like get to share it with you

09:13:38.680 --> 09:13:41.160
And just like show you everything about it like right now

09:13:41.160 --> 09:13:46.840
We're playing landlord simulator on it you can do this as you progress through the campaign mode

09:13:46.920 --> 09:13:50.760
But obviously we we finished the campaign mode. So never just don't landlord them

09:13:51.400 --> 09:13:53.400
uh

09:13:54.920 --> 09:13:56.920
Um, I don't know

09:13:57.640 --> 09:14:01.480
If I maybe I could order some food

09:14:03.240 --> 09:14:05.240
And then we take a break and I eat it

09:14:05.720 --> 09:14:07.720
uh

09:14:08.200 --> 09:14:09.320
Yeah

09:14:09.320 --> 09:14:12.360
You got to do what you love reeflings Johnny loves brother

09:14:13.160 --> 09:14:18.920
Oh, no if any of yousers stay enough. I'm so sorry. Yeah more content for eu frogs to just woke up

09:14:19.320 --> 09:14:24.520
That is hilarious because someone was like are you gonna stream earlier to be eu friendly?

09:14:25.160 --> 09:14:28.280
Um, and it's like well dependent on the game

09:14:28.760 --> 09:14:31.800
I might be online when you wake up

09:14:32.360 --> 09:14:38.920
Uh, so yeah, hi. Good morning. He you. How you doing?

09:14:41.480 --> 09:14:46.360
Um, I wish youtube would fix the 12 hour

09:14:47.400 --> 09:14:49.400
streaming vod issue

09:14:50.600 --> 09:14:51.720
Um

09:14:51.720 --> 09:14:57.480
If they did I honestly think I could do 14 hour streams like literally wake up

09:14:58.120 --> 09:15:04.920
Very quickly, you know toilet brush teeth get some food ready. I think I could genuinely do that

09:15:05.880 --> 09:15:08.680
Obviously my voice is croaking like a frog, but

09:15:09.800 --> 09:15:17.240
I don't want to stop like I'm having a good time. I don't want a fun time for pause champ. That sounds bad for your health. I mean

09:15:19.240 --> 09:15:24.440
I'm gonna say something controversial. I hope it doesn't come across like that, but for me

09:15:25.400 --> 09:15:29.560
To talk and play video games. I don't

09:15:30.600 --> 09:15:35.720
Feel I am over exerting myself as long as I have no current

09:15:36.360 --> 09:15:40.760
issues going on such as illness dehydration possibly

09:15:41.560 --> 09:15:43.560
um

09:15:43.800 --> 09:15:45.320
Or

09:15:45.320 --> 09:15:51.800
Other elements such as this that may prevent long-term streaming, but I am quite a happy bun

09:15:52.760 --> 09:15:54.760
My blood flow is good. My heart

09:15:55.640 --> 09:15:57.080
Is good to go

09:15:57.080 --> 09:15:58.120
um

09:15:58.120 --> 09:16:03.000
You know, I understand that some people may find it negative for their health to maybe

09:16:04.360 --> 09:16:08.120
Not like sit and play games for 12 hours, but me

09:16:09.080 --> 09:16:14.680
Of kinder I kind of done it for a long time like when I was um

09:16:16.040 --> 09:16:18.040
When I was younger I

09:16:18.360 --> 09:16:23.640
Had a rough time at high school. You know how it goes yawn yawn

09:16:24.440 --> 09:16:30.680
um, and I very comfortably played xbox all day long. Um,

09:16:31.320 --> 09:16:34.360
my parents were very understanding about my

09:16:35.240 --> 09:16:40.280
situation as best as they could when it came to high school and um

09:16:41.000 --> 09:16:45.160
Kind of not fitting in so I had a lot of days just to myself

09:16:45.960 --> 09:16:47.960
Left of my own devices and

09:16:48.840 --> 09:16:55.080
I used to just play xbox all day long and uh, yes, I'm very lucky to have the parents that I do

09:16:55.720 --> 09:16:57.160
and

09:16:57.160 --> 09:16:59.160
like I

09:16:59.160 --> 09:17:06.360
hear stories of parents that don't quite understand like maybe what anxiety is or what

09:17:07.080 --> 09:17:09.080
agoraphobia is or

09:17:09.720 --> 09:17:11.240
kind of

09:17:11.240 --> 09:17:13.240
these elements that may

09:17:14.200 --> 09:17:17.160
Make up parts of your being and

09:17:18.200 --> 09:17:20.200
kind of to have a parent who

09:17:21.080 --> 09:17:25.400
Who loves you who loves you and but just unable to comprehend

09:17:25.960 --> 09:17:32.200
How you are in the moment. It's rough and I do genuinely feel for you if you're in that situation

09:17:32.760 --> 09:17:38.840
I hope that you feel comforted in the fact that like here you're accepted

09:17:38.920 --> 09:17:41.400
You can be as autistic as you like, okay

09:17:42.360 --> 09:17:43.800
and

09:17:43.800 --> 09:17:45.800
you can

09:17:45.800 --> 09:17:51.000
Just be yourself. I know you might worry about messages and oh my goodness. What does she think but

09:17:52.520 --> 09:17:58.600
She thinks like herself, you know, I was in your shoes once most likely where

09:17:59.560 --> 09:18:06.600
I was terrified of the world. I was terrified to leave my room. My life was in my room

09:18:07.480 --> 09:18:14.120
Uh, and I was in my head and it's terrible when you're in your head. I wish I could pull you out instantly

09:18:14.280 --> 09:18:16.280
I wish I could pull you out overnight

09:18:16.520 --> 09:18:20.280
But guess what if watching my stream slowly pulls you out?

09:18:21.080 --> 09:18:23.080
goodness gravy

09:18:23.560 --> 09:18:26.040
Goodness gravy. Um, I am so

09:18:26.760 --> 09:18:30.120
Lucky to be the one that can show you

09:18:30.920 --> 09:18:36.040
That yes, the world is a scary place and guess what if your therapy is

09:18:36.760 --> 09:18:38.760
some random scots

09:18:39.400 --> 09:18:43.640
Playing the sassan's green brotherhood and nerdy now and then occasionally

09:18:44.120 --> 09:18:46.120
It's throwing out a joke here and there

09:18:47.320 --> 09:18:49.880
Let's get it. Let's get to it. You know

09:18:51.160 --> 09:18:53.960
The world is our oyster. Okay

09:18:56.360 --> 09:18:57.960
Like don't

09:18:57.960 --> 09:18:59.560
Take your time

09:18:59.560 --> 09:19:00.920
life

09:19:00.920 --> 09:19:05.640
As they say Rome wasn't built in a day get it because we're in Rome. Huh, huh, huh?

09:19:06.440 --> 09:19:12.280
And you know, you're not gonna figure out life in a day. Don't be silly. You're not gonna figure out in a week

09:19:12.280 --> 09:19:14.840
You're not gonna figure it out in a month. You're not gonna figure it out

09:19:15.640 --> 09:19:22.760
Until maybe you're even on the other side of it because how do you get life exp by living life?

09:19:23.720 --> 09:19:25.720
okay

09:19:26.920 --> 09:19:28.520
and

09:19:28.520 --> 09:19:34.280
I think if you might be someone who struggles to go outside maybe at the moment or

09:19:34.840 --> 09:19:36.840
with other areas

09:19:37.000 --> 09:19:39.160
If you want to see it like a video game

09:19:39.160 --> 09:19:41.800
It is the best way I could ever explain it

09:19:42.360 --> 09:19:46.040
Is that you're always gaining exp every day. You might say to yourself

09:19:46.600 --> 09:19:52.120
You know what? I'm just rotten in bed. I'm just watching streamers. I'm doing nothing. I'm not progressing

09:19:53.400 --> 09:19:58.360
What if I told you that even though vtuber's may be entertainers

09:19:59.000 --> 09:20:01.800
They can still teach you a thing or two about life like

09:20:02.600 --> 09:20:08.600
Communicating with people or listening to people communicate and hearing their opinions

09:20:09.000 --> 09:20:13.240
Giving you a new perspective on things you might never have considered before

09:20:13.800 --> 09:20:19.240
Like please don't ever think you genuinely are stagnant and rotting

09:20:19.560 --> 09:20:24.120
I know the terminology is rotten in bed and I've rotted all day. I've not done anything. I've did it

09:20:24.120 --> 09:20:25.160
I did it

09:20:25.160 --> 09:20:27.560
Well, I was told you you don't have to do anything

09:20:28.120 --> 09:20:30.440
Who said you had to do anything like

09:20:31.160 --> 09:20:33.160
Just

09:20:33.400 --> 09:20:40.360
One breath at a time one day at a time you have come so far and you have

09:20:41.640 --> 09:20:43.640
genuinely

09:20:43.800 --> 09:20:48.680
Um, like gone through every worst day of your life and you're still here

09:20:49.080 --> 09:20:54.840
You have no concept of how strong you are and like I'm like tearing up thinking about you. Oh my god

09:20:55.800 --> 09:20:57.560
Like um

09:20:57.560 --> 09:21:00.680
I'm happy to like share this like thing of the past, but

09:21:01.320 --> 09:21:03.400
I was having a rough day. Um

09:21:04.360 --> 09:21:07.400
And we listened to a song by mr. Kitty

09:21:08.040 --> 09:21:15.000
And I said the phrase you feel like this all the time and like oh i'm actually crying

09:21:15.640 --> 09:21:20.120
I don't want you guys to feel like that. Oh my proper crying. Hold on

09:21:20.920 --> 09:21:23.640
Oh, I need breathe. Hold on. I'm just being dramatic. Okay

09:21:24.360 --> 09:21:28.120
But like I don't like want you guys to feel like that like it's so

09:21:28.760 --> 09:21:31.640
like it just makes me feel so sad because

09:21:33.080 --> 09:21:37.000
Like I know how sad I used to feel and like

09:21:38.520 --> 09:21:43.880
Oh, I just don't want you to feel it. Right. I need to stop crying. I'm like, I'm literally such a baby

09:21:45.320 --> 09:21:47.320
No cry. No cry

09:21:47.640 --> 09:21:52.200
No cry literally happy tears like

09:21:52.840 --> 09:21:58.040
Oh, I think like there's just so many emotions like especially with like recently

09:21:58.840 --> 09:22:01.240
Like debut and like all these girls are

09:22:01.880 --> 09:22:06.760
Just like so fantastic and they all had faith in me and you guys all had faith in me

09:22:07.400 --> 09:22:12.760
But like it took so long to get here and there was like so much blood sweat and tears and it was like

09:22:13.640 --> 09:22:21.960
But I did it like I did it. I got past all those bad days and you've got past all those bad days like that's a fact and

09:22:23.640 --> 09:22:27.000
You know, I always say the phrase if life was easy

09:22:27.560 --> 09:22:33.240
Then how would the good times be so good if you wouldn't appreciate the good times, you know

09:22:34.120 --> 09:22:36.680

And literally like oh, I'm gonna start crying again, but you're so fucking strong

09:25:05.960 --> 09:25:10.760
Don't think of your like don't ever think of yourself like oh, I'm weak. No motherfucker

09:25:11.560 --> 09:25:13.560
You're a rifling

09:25:14.920 --> 09:25:18.280
Well, maybe even if you're not rifling while you're listening to this that's fine

09:25:18.680 --> 09:25:23.960
But you are very strong and you don't know it. You don't know it because you know

09:25:25.000 --> 09:25:29.800
If you haven't been presented with that idea or the concept that strength isn't in physical

09:25:30.520 --> 09:25:34.760
Uh, like brute, uh, not brutish ability, but physical physical strength

09:25:35.560 --> 09:25:41.560
Then how are you gonna know that you're like this strong until you've been told that you don't know any better until someone goes

09:25:42.120 --> 09:25:43.880
Hey, numb nuts

Wake up my goodness. Look at everything you've achieved. Look how far you've come

I don't want to get up out in bed anymore. I don't want to do this

09:25:56.680 --> 09:25:58.680
And yet here you are

09:25:59.560 --> 09:26:01.560
fucking crushing it

09:26:01.560 --> 09:26:03.320

09:26:03.320 --> 09:26:07.800
My god, what a blessing what a life like I don't believe in religion

Nordic people um, oh that sounded weird when I said that didn't mean it like that but yeah

09:27:02.280 --> 09:27:07.240
I still have days like that, but knowing how strong I am is like knowing the sun will come back. Yes

09:27:08.120 --> 09:27:13.640
Just because the sun is hiding behind the clouds right now

09:27:14.680 --> 09:27:19.560
Doesn't mean you will never feel the warmth of it on your face ever again

09:27:20.280 --> 09:27:22.280
The sun will hug you

09:27:22.920 --> 09:27:26.200
The sun will embrace you like the six

09:27:27.240 --> 09:27:31.160
Um even on the cloudiest of days the sun is always

09:27:31.880 --> 09:27:36.680
Shaming even if you can't see it or feel it's warm. This is true

09:27:37.880 --> 09:27:41.000
Hey, these are facts. Yes, but straight facts

09:27:43.240 --> 09:27:46.760
You need to make a motivational speech and we'll all jump before asking

Oh, that's so cute. Can you just feel the sun? Oh, are you are you ready for this?

09:27:57.800 --> 09:27:59.800
Speaking of the sun

09:28:01.800 --> 09:28:03.800
Oh wait, hold on. I've done it wrong

09:28:07.960 --> 09:28:09.960
Mm-hmm

09:28:10.360 --> 09:28:12.360
It's a bit wonky

09:28:24.120 --> 09:28:31.320
So please don't take my refling away, but if you're not a refill and that's fine

09:28:32.040 --> 09:28:34.040

09:29:13.800 --> 09:29:15.800

I think you should burp if you want to make us forget the crying and wholesome speech. Uh, I would need to call it for that

09:30:18.200 --> 09:30:19.400
But

09:30:19.400 --> 09:30:23.640
How much money have I got we need to invest in the black?

09:30:24.040 --> 09:30:30.120
No, we need to invest in the bank because the bank might have investment money in it

09:30:31.960 --> 09:30:33.960
Give a burp any burpers

09:30:34.840 --> 09:30:36.840
You know, I didn't think Vsucky would be in most here

09:30:38.680 --> 09:30:40.680
Okay, you're done

09:30:41.560 --> 09:30:43.560
Look

09:30:43.800 --> 09:30:49.160
At least some of you could appreciate the naming angle I went with because there was like the

Because there was succubus blood running around

09:30:53.240 --> 09:30:55.080

Has been renovated. We're getting there. We're getting there. I think there was a blacksmith up the staircase somewhere

A little bit further away, but yeah, that's fine got horses in that dinner

09:32:08.200 --> 09:32:10.920
The monster girl encyclopedia it depends

09:32:11.800 --> 09:32:19.160
To what degree you mean. Do you mean like I know what a slime girl is or this type of girl is then yes most likely

09:32:20.440 --> 09:32:25.960
But if you want me to get like super specific and be like did you did you did it? No

09:32:29.560 --> 09:32:35.000
Um why are you wanting a gen 2 to be someone out of that if you say slime girl

09:32:38.840 --> 09:32:44.600
As much as slime girl is beautiful in nature and in design

09:32:46.920 --> 09:32:48.920
For a vichy bar

09:32:51.480 --> 09:32:53.480

09:32:55.480 --> 09:32:58.680
It does not make me sprung um

09:33:00.680 --> 09:33:02.680

09:33:02.920 --> 09:33:09.560
Oh the series. Oh, no, I don't know the series of monster girl. No, no, sorry. I misunderstood the

09:33:11.320 --> 09:33:17.160
The uh explanation. No, I do not know monster girl series. I apologize

I am an endurance streamer. So I am going to be online for a very long time

09:33:41.160 --> 09:33:46.520
We have officially finished the campaign section of assassin's creed brotherhood

09:33:46.840 --> 09:33:54.840
We are currently going around renovating all buildings that we can at the moment and then we are likely to either do

09:33:55.800 --> 09:33:57.800
The layer of Romulus

09:33:58.360 --> 09:34:03.160
First due to its easy nature in comparison to Leonardo's

09:34:03.880 --> 09:34:09.000
Missions, we are not going to do Leonardo's. I think we might run out of time for Leonardo's mission

09:34:10.520 --> 09:34:14.040
I want to say I think we will run out of time. Um

09:34:15.960 --> 09:34:17.720
I will

09:34:17.720 --> 09:34:21.560
Uh go for as long as I can though. Uh, I might call a water

09:34:22.200 --> 09:34:29.160
Cola pee pee break and I am going to order some delivery food. Um, I'm not sure what I should order though

09:34:31.000 --> 09:34:37.400
I want to say right. Okay. So I've had mcdonald's in america and I've had mcdonald's in scotland

09:34:37.560 --> 09:34:39.560
I've had mcdonald's in australia

09:34:40.040 --> 09:34:44.200
Do you want to know which country's mcdonald's makes my ass blow out?

09:34:46.840 --> 09:34:48.680
Australia

09:34:48.680 --> 09:34:50.680
Not america

09:34:51.000 --> 09:34:54.280
I don't know what is with australian mcdonald's

09:34:55.000 --> 09:34:56.360
um

09:34:56.360 --> 09:35:00.120
But for some reason it destroys

09:35:01.000 --> 09:35:02.120
my

09:35:02.120 --> 09:35:04.120
intestines

09:35:04.920 --> 09:35:06.920
They genuinely cannot handle

09:35:08.280 --> 09:35:12.760
A maca's. I don't know if it's because they don't change the oil maybe. Um

09:35:14.120 --> 09:35:19.080
Not beating the change of the oil accusations, but it's very plausible because yeah

09:35:21.000 --> 09:35:26.760
Hungry jack possibly I've never had a problem with hungry jack with my tummy

09:35:27.560 --> 09:35:29.560
um

09:35:29.960 --> 09:35:34.200
Hungry jack is burger king in australia

09:35:36.760 --> 09:35:40.040
Uh, yeah, like I have no desire for maca's here

09:35:41.080 --> 09:35:44.200
Because of that fact. So honestly, thank you

09:35:45.320 --> 09:35:49.320
Australia maca's because I don't really consume your your foods

09:35:51.320 --> 09:35:53.320

I'm gonna do uh an arrow storm because you have to do 15 arrow storms 12 12 tailors renovated

09:36:14.760 --> 09:36:18.120
I did an arrow storm and for some reason it didn't hurt him

09:36:18.920 --> 09:36:20.920

09:36:51.240 --> 09:36:56.200
I will take your word for it and I will exchange for your words

09:36:57.080 --> 09:36:58.840
my gratitude

09:36:58.840 --> 09:37:01.400
for being open to a new

09:37:02.680 --> 09:37:05.720
person's content because

09:37:06.600 --> 09:37:09.560
it is very natural to

09:37:10.360 --> 09:37:16.840
Um, find someone you enjoy and not deviate from them. So the fact that you were willing to

09:37:17.800 --> 09:37:22.280
Maybe deviate from who you consume. I appreciate that and I

09:37:23.080 --> 09:37:28.280
Exchange my gratitudes and I'm very thankful you gave me a chance and I am glad I

09:37:28.920 --> 09:37:29.960
Even in my own way

09:37:29.960 --> 09:37:35.800
Like I don't feel pressured in the stream to like perform to do anything to to crack these jokes to do this to do that

09:37:36.120 --> 09:37:41.400
Like I am so glad I can just be myself and you're like, yeah

09:37:42.040 --> 09:37:43.800
Yeah

09:37:43.800 --> 09:37:46.040
I'm like, yeah, and you're like, yeah

09:37:47.080 --> 09:37:48.920
And I'm like, yeah, yeah

And you're like, yeah

It's like, yeah, yeah, but yeah, yeah

09:38:01.400 --> 09:38:02.680
Um

09:38:02.680 --> 09:38:09.880
Righty who we do have a viewpoint down in this district and a few missing buildings

09:38:10.680 --> 09:38:15.720
I might go get a cola just to energize me and quickly order some

09:38:16.840 --> 09:38:18.680
Take away

09:38:18.680 --> 09:38:20.040
um

09:38:20.040 --> 09:38:25.880
We can have a little nibble very quickly and then we can explore

09:38:27.000 --> 09:38:30.920
The uh, I'm actually gonna poison these guards. That sounds terrible, but

09:38:31.880 --> 09:38:33.880
um, and

09:38:35.080 --> 09:38:42.280
Actually that reminds me why haven't I got the court is on sorry. I'm getting sorry. I'm getting I'm getting hit on purpose

09:38:42.360 --> 09:38:49.640
I'm not just playing bad like that. I thought there was a court is on poison five guards. Is it poison 15 guards?

09:38:51.480 --> 09:38:53.480
Maybe it's poison 15 guards

09:38:54.760 --> 09:39:00.520
So it's scheduled successfully ruined. I still don't know if she can feel her. I've been my new obsession. Oh, I'm so glad

09:39:01.080 --> 09:39:03.080
Thank you

09:39:04.840 --> 09:39:09.400
Uh, I've been around too many people who made me feel like fresh

09:39:10.120 --> 09:39:11.560
sorry

09:39:11.640 --> 09:39:16.360
Of words are hard. I've been around too many people who made me feel that

09:39:16.760 --> 09:39:20.440
Pressuring myself was normal. So nice to see people your mindset. Just be genuine

09:39:23.160 --> 09:39:25.160
Literally I'm gonna cough um

09:39:25.800 --> 09:39:30.760
Yeah, excuse me. Uh, I'm actually pretty low on water. So I will need to call a break very shortly

09:39:32.520 --> 09:39:34.520
Um

09:39:34.600 --> 09:39:36.600
Yeah, um

09:39:37.480 --> 09:39:39.480
Yeah, definitely like

09:39:40.040 --> 09:39:42.840
Is it weird to say like autism friendly streamer?

09:39:44.760 --> 09:39:48.120
Oh, we've got a nice bit of money with that. Uh, what we are we are level eight

09:39:49.240 --> 09:39:53.800
Oh, we've got our first level eight assassin, which is fantastic

09:39:54.440 --> 09:39:56.440
Uh

09:39:56.760 --> 09:40:00.760
Yeah, okay, uh, we might be able to do a first five star mission

09:40:01.320 --> 09:40:03.320
Nah

09:40:04.280 --> 09:40:11.000
No, maybe send away you two to get promotion send away

09:40:12.200 --> 09:40:15.960

And we'll do two level three missions and we'll should be back in the money

09:40:34.040 --> 09:40:36.040
Okay

09:40:36.200 --> 09:40:41.720
I am going to go get a water and a cola. Um, and a

09:40:42.840 --> 09:40:44.280
Little pass

09:40:44.280 --> 09:40:48.920
Probably um, I had a I've already had three cups of tea. So I think that's been done for tea for the day

09:40:49.080 --> 09:40:51.080
I was like cling my teacup

09:40:51.240 --> 09:40:52.840
um

09:40:52.840 --> 09:40:54.360
But yes, I'll be three minutes

09:40:54.440 --> 09:40:58.360
I highly recommend that you get up and stretch your little legs

09:40:58.680 --> 09:41:03.720
Um, get a little stretch go to the toilet get any more hydration you may need

09:41:04.520 --> 09:41:07.560
Um, I do have a bit of a different

09:41:08.520 --> 09:41:13.160
Conclusion to the end of this stream because I got a unique marshmallow. Um

09:41:14.200 --> 09:41:18.040
But I'll talk about when I get back. It's nothing bad. Please don't panic. Absolutely nothing bad

09:41:18.040 --> 09:41:20.040
No one's done anything

09:41:20.040 --> 09:41:25.000
Uh, but I would like to talk about it and we will try our best to help each other out as we do

09:41:25.480 --> 09:41:26.600
Um

09:41:26.600 --> 09:41:27.960
Okay, I will do the thing

09:41:27.960 --> 09:41:32.520
I always do it where I'm actually going to claim up so a thief doesn't take any of my money

09:41:32.520 --> 09:41:37.240
Because I would like to keep my money so I can keep renovating buildings and all that

09:41:38.120 --> 09:41:43.000
Uh, so I will give you this beautiful sight of roma

09:41:43.720 --> 09:41:48.600
Look, there's a look that man down there serenading that lady by the cat pole

09:41:48.920 --> 09:41:53.400
I will give you this beautiful view. Oh, you can't see it. Sorry. Maybe you can see it now

09:41:53.720 --> 09:41:56.200
I was probably covering it up with my bf. Hey

09:41:57.320 --> 09:41:59.800
Okay, I will give you this beautiful sight of roma

09:42:00.440 --> 09:42:05.080
Hey, I'll mute. I'll be roughly three minutes. Uh, please do get up and stretch get some water in here

09:42:05.480 --> 09:42:08.520
Hey, if you need some more some drinks, maybe some snacks

Uh, there's still another t-minus two hours to the stream

09:42:13.240 --> 09:42:15.240
um, and

09:42:15.240 --> 09:42:20.520
Merci modista live right now if you want to get in on the action her link is in my description

09:42:21.480 --> 09:42:23.480
And you can check around

09:42:24.040 --> 09:42:31.160
Okay, I'll be back and three minutes roughly. Uh, let me do do the old close my eyes before I uh

09:42:32.600 --> 09:42:35.160
Walk away type thing ready

09:42:38.760 --> 09:42:40.760
Okay, there we go

09:42:50.520 --> 09:42:52.760
You

09:43:20.520 --> 09:43:22.520
Oh

09:43:50.520 --> 09:43:52.520
You

09:44:20.520 --> 09:44:22.520
You

09:44:50.520 --> 09:44:52.520
You

09:45:20.520 --> 09:45:22.520
You

09:45:50.520 --> 09:45:52.520
You

09:46:20.520 --> 09:46:22.520
You

09:46:50.520 --> 09:46:52.520
You

09:47:20.520 --> 09:47:22.520
You

09:47:50.920 --> 09:47:55.720
You've been enjoying the background music of this game. It's goaded

09:47:57.400 --> 09:47:59.400
It's goaded up all the time

09:48:02.840 --> 09:48:07.160
Uh, it looks like we got one recruit back so far

09:48:08.440 --> 09:48:10.440
We do have 10k. That's good money

09:48:10.760 --> 09:48:16.200
I have water and I have a can of cola got better better fizzy juice

09:48:16.520 --> 09:48:21.560
But if it's a juice for me, it's probably the worst thing I could do for my throat right now, but

09:48:23.400 --> 09:48:25.400
Honestly, honestly

09:48:26.680 --> 09:48:28.680
Does it even matter?

09:48:30.280 --> 09:48:35.160
Like I can already feel I have nodules in my throat who cares it's too late. Leave me behind

09:48:37.320 --> 09:48:42.920
Mmm, we do have very high. Okay. Yeah, levelly. He can just absolutely beast that

09:48:43.880 --> 09:48:46.920
All right, let's go on business. What's your opinion on iron brew?

09:48:47.480 --> 09:48:53.560
Did you know the most popular fizzy juice sold worldwide is cola?

09:48:54.200 --> 09:48:56.040
except

09:48:56.040 --> 09:49:03.080
For in scotland the only country where the number one sold fizzy juice is iron brew

09:49:03.400 --> 09:49:05.400
And I do like iron brew. It's very good

09:49:05.960 --> 09:49:11.400
Um, vim too is also very good if you have a uh, we're going this way. I remember now. Um

09:49:13.720 --> 09:49:18.280
If you have fish and chips, vim too is very good for cutting the grease like

09:49:18.760 --> 09:49:22.600
Sprite as well. It helps to cut the grease of your takeaway

09:49:24.360 --> 09:49:26.360
Never had iron brew, but I want it

09:49:28.200 --> 09:49:32.600
Um, if you are in australia, you can go to your willies

09:49:33.480 --> 09:49:36.360
And they actually sell it in the british section

09:49:37.320 --> 09:49:44.040
Unbelievably, it's at a premium rate, but make sure you refrigerate it iron brew should never be consumed at room temperature

09:49:44.120 --> 09:49:49.640
Please do not do that to yourself and please understand. It is an acquired taste

09:49:50.360 --> 09:49:55.480
But children of scotland were basically raised on neon orange

09:49:56.280 --> 09:49:57.480
drink

09:49:57.480 --> 09:49:59.480
So, yeah

09:50:00.280 --> 09:50:02.280
Um

09:50:03.880 --> 09:50:11.560
What does it taste like so iron brew themselves have said it's supposed to taste like ginger and bubblegum

09:50:12.120 --> 09:50:15.240
It absolutely does not at all

09:50:16.120 --> 09:50:19.240
taste like that i'm actually going to hire these because I need to do

09:50:20.600 --> 09:50:22.120
distract

09:50:22.120 --> 09:50:24.280
Um, it does not taste like this at all

09:50:25.000 --> 09:50:31.400
I don't even I could not tell you anything remotely what it tastes like other than battery acid

09:50:32.920 --> 09:50:35.960
Yeah, if you've ever smelled battery acid

09:50:38.120 --> 09:50:41.960
Uh, that's what iron brew tastes like but like not bad

09:50:42.600 --> 09:50:44.200
battery acid

09:50:44.200 --> 09:50:45.880
You're still alive

09:50:45.880 --> 09:50:47.800
Yes, sorry

09:50:47.800 --> 09:50:52.840
We have finished the main campaign. We are currently renovating all of roma

09:50:53.400 --> 09:50:58.840
We've started our serious landlord enterprise. It's going pretty well if I do say so myself

09:51:00.040 --> 09:51:02.040
and

09:51:02.200 --> 09:51:04.200
Willy Wonker and iron brew no

09:51:07.080 --> 09:51:09.800
So basically mountain dew um

09:51:12.600 --> 09:51:15.800
I did get an opportunity to taste mountain dew

09:51:17.000 --> 09:51:19.000
I

09:51:19.000 --> 09:51:23.240
Honestly wouldn't fault you. Yeah, I would say that's probably the closest ever

09:51:23.960 --> 09:51:28.760
Taste you would get to iron brew, but it is still different. What are you mining?

09:51:29.560 --> 09:51:31.560
Play minecraft out here

09:51:32.440 --> 09:51:37.800
He's tilling the soil with a pickaxe. You're supposed to use a hole for tilling soil

09:51:40.040 --> 09:51:45.480
Wait, are you beating the whole game? Uh, I have already done the campaign

09:51:46.360 --> 09:51:52.280
Uh, like which means the story like chesery has been perished to fate itself because no man can murder me

09:51:53.240 --> 09:51:57.800
We are now going through the map and renovate renovate and combine all the buildings

09:51:58.200 --> 09:52:03.560
And then next we're going to do the layers of romulus which are these little wolf marks here

09:52:04.280 --> 09:52:08.120
And if we have time we will do the leonardo missions

09:52:09.240 --> 09:52:14.120
And the catarina missions and the auditory family missions

09:52:15.640 --> 09:52:20.040
We are going to stop at the 12 hour mark very sadly

09:52:20.920 --> 09:52:23.800
Not because I don't actually want to stream more

09:52:24.440 --> 09:52:28.520
But because vods for some reason freak out

09:52:29.640 --> 09:52:36.840
After the 12 hour mark and it is such a shame because if it didn't I think I could confidently

09:52:37.640 --> 09:52:39.640
Finish all the mission

09:52:41.400 --> 09:52:43.080
Which is a shame

09:52:43.080 --> 09:52:46.520
Because definitely could do it if it wasn't for the

09:52:48.120 --> 09:52:52.840
BOD issues so uh mercy is live right now. I am t-minus two hours

09:52:53.880 --> 09:52:55.880
um

09:52:56.120 --> 09:52:58.120
Start a new stream easy peasy

09:52:59.400 --> 09:53:08.360
I am tempted however, um, there is a yumi plus member waiting on my side of an ace marco lab

09:53:09.000 --> 09:53:13.800
And I don't want to leave her waiting. I also have to contact dempo fish

09:53:14.360 --> 09:53:16.360
about the ace marco lab

09:53:16.680 --> 09:53:24.200
Um, and I really don't want anyone to think I am taking their kindness and their time for granted

09:53:24.680 --> 09:53:26.680
because on top of streaming

09:53:26.840 --> 09:53:33.400
If someone comes to you asking for an ace marco lab and you do this and you do that like these girls are so hard working

09:53:33.960 --> 09:53:35.000
and

09:53:35.000 --> 09:53:39.560
I know some people might find streaming looks very easy on the surface

09:53:39.720 --> 09:53:45.320
but people have lives and they have things going on and they have ailments and

09:53:45.960 --> 09:53:47.640
They have family issues

09:53:47.640 --> 09:53:53.000
They have they might even not even be able to stream as much as they like due to their living situation like

09:53:53.560 --> 09:53:57.080
I just want to respect the time that I ask and

09:53:57.960 --> 09:54:01.960
Give the girls like these ace marco labs like get it all sorted out and

09:54:02.360 --> 09:54:07.880
Because if they've been kind enough to give me the time of day, I want to completely wholeheartedly respect that. Um

09:54:09.080 --> 09:54:11.080
So hopefully tomorrow

09:54:11.880 --> 09:54:12.840
um

09:54:12.840 --> 09:54:18.840
Before I stream uh yumi will have a collab of me and her on her channel

09:54:19.320 --> 09:54:22.440
If all goes well, sadly the ace mar

09:54:23.400 --> 09:54:30.680
Memes for all violour members is paused right now until I know what's going on with monetization

09:54:31.480 --> 09:54:33.480
and culling because

09:54:35.000 --> 09:54:37.000
um

09:54:37.800 --> 09:54:39.560
The memes are quite fun

09:54:39.560 --> 09:54:47.400
But the nature of them depending on how mean youtube want to be recently with ace mar. It's quite uh nerve wracking

09:54:48.520 --> 09:54:50.520
at the moment

09:54:51.240 --> 09:54:57.400
Talking about ace mar. Did you give any of the girls advice for their first ace mar streams? Um only one girl

09:54:57.960 --> 09:54:59.960
uh came to me for

09:55:00.440 --> 09:55:02.120
Advice

09:55:02.120 --> 09:55:05.080
I don't think she'd be embarrassed if I said um

09:55:06.360 --> 09:55:08.360
Lovely azura has never

09:55:09.240 --> 09:55:14.520
So she's she's never made ace mar herself. However, she has consumed the content

09:55:15.160 --> 09:55:16.360
um

09:55:16.360 --> 09:55:18.600
But because she's a yapper

09:55:19.240 --> 09:55:21.720
She's like I can't really focus and know what to say

09:55:22.200 --> 09:55:28.120
So I gave her a very small page of prompts that she can say just to help her out

09:55:28.680 --> 09:55:33.160
So please do enjoy her ace mar stream when she does it to the full extent

09:55:33.880 --> 09:55:34.920
um

09:55:34.920 --> 09:55:39.720
Because she's just very lovely. Um, I think she's just a wee bit

09:55:40.360 --> 09:55:43.800
Unconfident, but I am sure with the love she gets from

09:55:44.680 --> 09:55:47.960
Her bleeding hearts. I don't know if bleeding hearts is getting changed

09:55:48.440 --> 09:55:51.480
But the love that you guys will show will instill

09:55:52.120 --> 09:55:55.880
The confidence that I know she will have one day

09:55:56.840 --> 09:56:01.720
And you know doing this and uh, yeah, as I said, I've got faith in it

09:56:03.000 --> 09:56:06.680
Gonna have to try and someplace around here that sells. I'm bro. My interest has me peaked

09:56:08.120 --> 09:56:09.800
Willys

09:56:09.800 --> 09:56:15.640
Willys go to the british section or the indian section at willys. I kid you not. They're at the same section

09:56:17.720 --> 09:56:18.760
Um

09:56:18.760 --> 09:56:21.400
We'll take great care of mama as yes

09:56:22.360 --> 09:56:28.920
Um, she is very caring naturally like I kid you not like it's not a role play

09:56:29.480 --> 09:56:32.360
Like she is very caring naturally

09:56:33.080 --> 09:56:34.760
um

09:56:34.760 --> 09:56:39.560
And as her confidence grows, I think it'll very it will come across

09:56:40.440 --> 09:56:46.120
Um, and I'm just very excited to watch her blossom as a streamer because

09:56:47.800 --> 09:56:49.800
She she's just

09:56:50.760 --> 09:56:52.760
She's being propelled

09:56:53.080 --> 09:56:55.800
Not into a new world. She has had very

09:56:57.000 --> 09:57:05.000
Long history of streaming, but she's definitely been propelled. I think is the fair word to say and um

09:57:05.640 --> 09:57:13.000
You know, she's trying out new things and I'm I'm absolutely I'm all for I I hope um, she feels

09:57:13.880 --> 09:57:17.800
Able to reach out to me as I said with all the girls they have reached out to me at one point

09:57:17.880 --> 09:57:25.320
And you know, I advise the best I can but the true fact of the day is all the girls have more streaming experience than me

09:57:25.800 --> 09:57:26.840
so

09:57:26.840 --> 09:57:28.840
There's like only

09:57:28.920 --> 09:57:30.920
So much value to my words

09:57:31.480 --> 09:57:33.480
and it's like

09:57:33.560 --> 09:57:35.160
my darlin

09:57:35.160 --> 09:57:42.520
My darlin, I love you, but I can't give you advice on this because the fact of the matter is you're more experienced than me

09:57:43.320 --> 09:57:50.680
And like it's okay to experiment. It's okay to find figure things out. Um, it's okay to do these things

09:57:51.480 --> 09:57:58.440
Um, I think we've fully renovated everything but this missed aqueduct possibly uh other than the

09:58:00.280 --> 09:58:07.160
Location so I think we'll actually do a layer of romuli. Uh, there's one down here. So we'll do this one first

09:58:07.560 --> 09:58:11.800
My darlin. Yes, like I'm kind of like my darlin

09:58:13.080 --> 09:58:17.240
There is a point, uh, which pains me to admit but

09:58:18.360 --> 09:58:21.240
There's a point where I'm of no use to you

09:58:22.040 --> 09:58:26.280
Um, there's only so much my knowledge so far goes

09:58:26.280 --> 09:58:30.680
Like I definitely have knowledge of the ASMR side of things audio roleplay side of things

09:58:31.320 --> 09:58:33.320
But stream advice

09:58:34.120 --> 09:58:40.040
Uh, my stream advice is I've just done what I want and it worked out

09:58:40.600 --> 09:58:45.960
And the truth of that fact is that is not how it works for everyone

09:58:46.600 --> 09:58:53.640
And it's just not possible and it is not responsible either for me to give streaming advice

09:58:54.520 --> 09:58:56.120
like that

09:58:56.120 --> 09:59:00.680
Knowing full well, that's not how it works for everyone and I think it's um

09:59:01.160 --> 09:59:05.640
Um, I think it's perfectly okay to admit um

09:59:06.840 --> 09:59:13.240
I'm sorry, but I'm not knowledgeable enough. I can come up with fun stream ideas. I can come up with fun collab ideas

09:59:13.240 --> 09:59:15.400
I can come up with fun event ideas

09:59:16.120 --> 09:59:18.280
But to actually sit on stream

09:59:19.160 --> 09:59:21.880
I'm not the streamer. You're the streamer

09:59:22.840 --> 09:59:24.600
You know

09:59:24.600 --> 09:59:26.600
And uh, I have full faith

09:59:26.680 --> 09:59:29.640
They will do make they will do nothing

09:59:30.280 --> 09:59:36.520
Less than make me proud. Do nothing but make me proud. Yeah, do nothing but make me proud

09:59:37.080 --> 09:59:41.720
Um, not that it's their responsibility to prove themselves to me

09:59:42.680 --> 09:59:48.280
Because they proved themselves to me long ago. I saw myself in them and uh

09:59:49.000 --> 09:59:56.440
Different ways for me. I saw the shitposting side of me for she be I saw the side of me that

09:59:57.320 --> 10:00:03.640
Literally just needed a hand up. That's all I needed. She be as fully stacked to go. She just needed a hand up

10:00:04.200 --> 10:00:07.400
Um, Azura just needed a chance. Um

10:00:08.600 --> 10:00:10.600
mercedes

10:00:10.680 --> 10:00:15.160
Determination that her unending unending stamina

10:00:15.960 --> 10:00:17.240
um

10:00:17.240 --> 10:00:22.920
And I say her experience to hone her craft like I see

10:00:23.640 --> 10:00:25.640
myself in these little

10:00:26.040 --> 10:00:27.640
little

10:00:27.640 --> 10:00:28.840
parts

10:00:28.840 --> 10:00:30.840
Which made it so easy

10:00:32.040 --> 10:00:37.080
to relate to the girls to have trust in the girls to have faith in the girls and

10:00:37.880 --> 10:00:39.000
um

10:00:39.000 --> 10:00:41.000
That's just the fact of the matter

10:00:41.640 --> 10:00:43.000
um

10:00:43.000 --> 10:00:50.200
And all of them have so much potential and I really hope that viola gives them

10:00:51.240 --> 10:00:53.240
that opportunity

10:00:53.320 --> 10:00:54.360
to

10:00:54.360 --> 10:00:58.920
Bring themselves to the next level and achieve what their dreams are

10:00:59.560 --> 10:01:05.560
When it comes to being a content creator a streamer oopsies ran off the wall. Um

10:01:07.640 --> 10:01:09.640
And yeah

10:01:10.680 --> 10:01:12.680
That's that's just me

10:01:14.040 --> 10:01:18.280
I'm just so happy. Uh, yes, this looks like I'm going around in circles

10:01:19.160 --> 10:01:23.480
It's part of the map. Um, so this is before yellow paint is a thing

10:01:24.200 --> 10:01:30.200
Uh, because Assassin's Creed use torches for these parts of the chambers if you go the wrong way

10:01:30.680 --> 10:01:32.360
Then you're just going to get money

10:01:32.360 --> 10:01:38.840
Which is fine if you want to collect boxes. There are flags as well, but we're not doing the flags just yet

10:01:38.840 --> 10:01:40.840
We're doing that tomorrow

10:01:41.240 --> 10:01:43.240
But for now

10:01:44.120 --> 10:01:46.120
Did I need to go that way?

10:01:47.080 --> 10:01:51.480
Mom me what scrawny sounds like a mom gasping up her kids

10:01:52.600 --> 10:01:54.280
honestly though

10:01:54.280 --> 10:02:00.680
Like I didn't really know what to expect them to like call me and stuff and they all call me mom

10:02:02.520 --> 10:02:04.520
Which I adore um

10:02:05.640 --> 10:02:08.120
And they're all like, oh, I love you scrawny and I'm like, oh

10:02:08.440 --> 10:02:13.560
We're passing around the L word and I'm like, oh because like I didn't want to be the first one to say that

10:02:14.440 --> 10:02:15.560
But like

10:02:15.560 --> 10:02:17.560
I love you too. Like my god

10:02:17.640 --> 10:02:18.920
thank you for like

10:02:18.920 --> 10:02:24.680
believing in me and seeing the goal and and believing in yourself to like reach out and grab it

10:02:25.400 --> 10:02:32.280
um, if you've ever kind of looked around on vtuber applications like applications open now

10:02:32.840 --> 10:02:36.360
the most common tweet under these things is

10:02:37.160 --> 10:02:43.400
Like I am not confident enough to go out and reach for this and it is such

10:02:43.960 --> 10:02:45.240
a shame

10:02:45.240 --> 10:02:51.080
Because truly it is you miss a hundred percent of the things you don't go for and like it's just

10:02:51.800 --> 10:02:53.800
I almost fell down. Um

10:02:54.200 --> 10:02:56.200
it's just like such a shame

10:02:56.360 --> 10:02:57.480
but

10:02:57.480 --> 10:03:05.320
like good on the girls for reaching out and basically letting me grab their hand like thank you for

10:03:05.880 --> 10:03:07.880
letting me do that for you. Um

10:03:08.520 --> 10:03:09.480
type thing

10:03:09.480 --> 10:03:13.480
Like thank you for enabling yourself to enable me. It's what I'm trying to say

10:03:15.080 --> 10:03:19.560
I like your stamina. I wasn't expecting it. You should see me in the bedroom. Sorry. I was just

10:03:20.440 --> 10:03:22.440
I'm sorry. I apologize

10:03:24.040 --> 10:03:26.040
She's still streaming. Yes or e

10:03:26.600 --> 10:03:31.960
Finish the campaign. We're now doing layers of Romulus which unblocks the special armor

10:03:32.600 --> 10:03:36.680
Sorry, it was too easy. It was too easy. You made it so easy

10:03:39.320 --> 10:03:41.320
I just checked

10:03:42.440 --> 10:03:44.440
Oh

10:03:46.600 --> 10:03:52.840
Opsies, I just realized this is not a jump down and I realized the second I launched at that skeleton

10:03:54.200 --> 10:03:55.400
You can

10:03:55.400 --> 10:03:57.880
Drop and grab at these sections

10:03:57.960 --> 10:04:02.600
I really do not like dropping and grabbing because it's kind of hard to judge where you're to go next

10:04:03.000 --> 10:04:05.000
um

10:04:05.400 --> 10:04:06.840
However

10:04:06.840 --> 10:04:09.880
The camera does assist you mildly

10:04:10.840 --> 10:04:15.320
And it's a bit of a really do you have to do it like that? But yeah

10:04:19.480 --> 10:04:21.320
Yeah

10:04:21.320 --> 10:04:23.320
Aren't you a quick show though?

10:04:23.640 --> 10:04:25.400
You shut the hell up

10:04:25.400 --> 10:04:27.400
You freaking freaks

10:04:27.480 --> 10:04:30.760
I tell you that in confidence and you throw it on my face

10:04:33.240 --> 10:04:35.240
I'm trying to remember which one this is again

10:04:35.320 --> 10:04:39.080
Just follow the light if you ever get confused at the section of the game

10:04:39.640 --> 10:04:47.560
Uh the game when you're in catacomb like levels the game will unironically light the way to tell you where to go

10:04:48.200 --> 10:04:51.960
Again, we're getting teased by that flag, but we don't why did you not grab that?

10:04:52.520 --> 10:04:54.520
Is anyone supposed to go there?

10:04:55.080 --> 10:05:01.240
Am I not supposed to go there? No, I'm supposed to go there. It's you. You're teasing me

10:05:01.960 --> 10:05:07.560
Such a naughty naughty. It's you grab the ledge. Yeah, so you were supposed to grab it

10:05:09.720 --> 10:05:13.880
I've never played assassin you bought games, but haven't played them

10:05:15.960 --> 10:05:17.960
Hey, it's all

10:05:18.280 --> 10:05:24.200
Um, maybe you work a lot and you think the game looks good and then you say to yourself

10:05:24.280 --> 10:05:29.160
I'll play it when I'm not tired, but then after work you're like man. I'm exhausted

10:05:29.240 --> 10:05:31.480
I don't really feel like playing a new game

10:05:32.040 --> 10:05:37.320
And then you feel like playing games that you're familiar with and that is the power of nostalgia

10:05:39.400 --> 10:05:41.400
Very powerful drug

10:05:41.960 --> 10:05:45.720
And that is why media today is regurgitated a lot

10:05:46.680 --> 10:05:51.880
Because of the power of nostalgia unironically, that's why they have Beal just who coming out

10:05:58.440 --> 10:06:01.160
It's really interesting learning about marketing trends as well

10:06:03.160 --> 10:06:05.720
Hmm, maybe we could do a business

10:06:06.440 --> 10:06:12.280
Analysing stream. I wouldn't mind yapping about that. I wouldn't mind yapping about biology as well. Um

10:06:13.240 --> 10:06:15.240
I wanted to test an

10:06:17.080 --> 10:06:19.080
Educational stream

10:06:19.640 --> 10:06:21.320
um

10:06:21.320 --> 10:06:24.040
I thought we could do a

10:06:25.400 --> 10:06:27.400
Full stream day

10:06:28.120 --> 10:06:32.120
And it's like literally like a full day at school again

10:06:32.920 --> 10:06:34.760
and

10:06:34.760 --> 10:06:38.680
Because I would be like, okay, we're doing English and then we're gonna like

10:06:39.560 --> 10:06:44.680
And like I'm gonna wait unironically. I'm gonna ask questions and I'm gonna wait until someone gets it right

10:06:46.440 --> 10:06:48.680
Who the heck just rated it in me

10:06:49.640 --> 10:06:55.960
Rhea, how dare you Rhea? Hi Rhea. How was your stream? Hopefully I'm saying your name right. I apologize

10:06:56.520 --> 10:06:58.520
But hi

10:06:58.520 --> 10:07:00.760
How was your stream with a heck where you's dating?

10:07:01.320 --> 10:07:08.760
I'm so sorry to uh raise uh viewers. I am Scottish. I apologize if you can't understand me so well

10:07:08.840 --> 10:07:14.040
But hi raiders. Welcome in. We are playing Assassin's Creed brotherhood and

10:07:16.280 --> 10:07:19.800
Jot invasion jot jet oat

10:07:20.280 --> 10:07:22.280
Is that how you say it?

10:07:22.440 --> 10:07:26.040
Uh any joters? Well, hello joters and you come

10:07:26.040 --> 10:07:31.960
Um, what were you playing or were you yapping? Were you speaking Japanese on on stream?

10:07:34.840 --> 10:07:41.160
Although you're probably exhausted after stream to be honest, you're like, please strongy. Don't ask me any questions. I'm exhausted

10:07:41.720 --> 10:07:43.720
That's fair. That's fair

10:07:44.200 --> 10:07:48.840
Uh, we are playing uh, Assassin's Creed brotherhood

10:07:49.240 --> 10:07:54.600
Uh, and we're doing the catacombs which have been lighted lighted the path that they have been lit

10:07:55.320 --> 10:07:57.320
Um, and it tells us where to go

10:08:01.080 --> 10:08:04.040
Strongies 365 so in Scottish, but it's actually

10:08:05.960 --> 10:08:07.480
Yeah

10:08:07.480 --> 10:08:12.360
Um, but yes, thank you so much for reading to me. I appreciate that. Please relax and rest well after stream

10:08:12.920 --> 10:08:15.720
Uh, you've done a fantastic job pat yourself on the back

10:08:16.600 --> 10:08:22.120
And for the jokes, uh, my name is strongy culls. I am part of valour

10:08:23.080 --> 10:08:25.080
Umie plus were absolutely

10:08:25.480 --> 10:08:29.560
Lovely and did a watch along of our debuts. We are incredible new

10:08:30.040 --> 10:08:35.960
Um, and I am strongy the scottish cuttlefish. I am an endurance streamer and today we are playing

10:08:36.760 --> 10:08:42.840
Assassin's Creed brotherhood. We have completed the storyline the main quest line the campaign

10:08:43.480 --> 10:08:47.960
Uh, and we are currently doing what's known as the lair of romulus

10:08:48.680 --> 10:08:51.320
I just got stabbed if you saw that by throwing now

10:08:51.880 --> 10:08:54.520
Uh, um, unfortunately the camera angles are a bit

10:08:55.320 --> 10:09:02.120
However, uh, the games have held up quite well to the test of time because Assassin's Creed brotherhood was developed in

10:09:02.840 --> 10:09:03.880
no

10:09:03.880 --> 10:09:05.880
was released in

10:09:06.440 --> 10:09:08.440
2010

10:09:08.760 --> 10:09:10.760
um, and

10:09:10.840 --> 10:09:12.840
um

10:09:12.920 --> 10:09:18.440
It's a childhood game of mine. So I'm very happy to play it for a very long time. I'm just waiting for the sky to attack me

10:09:18.680 --> 10:09:20.680
Apologies get a little distracted there

10:09:22.280 --> 10:09:24.280
Okay, he just fell to his death

10:09:25.800 --> 10:09:27.800
Hey, yeah

10:09:29.240 --> 10:09:34.920
So development most likely was 2007, which is crazy to think about

10:09:35.560 --> 10:09:37.880
Although it might have been on the back of

10:09:38.120 --> 10:09:43.400
Assassin's Creed 2. I would 100% believe it was off the back of Assassin's Creed 2

10:09:44.360 --> 10:09:47.160
Um, all things considered because brotherhood

10:09:48.120 --> 10:09:50.120
Definitely. Oh, I'm tamed

10:09:51.720 --> 10:09:57.400
I just I have seven seconds to complete the memory. Yeah. Good luck with that. We'll be replaying this one

10:09:57.640 --> 10:10:00.360
I didn't realize I got tamed on the other ones as well

10:10:02.040 --> 10:10:04.920
Filling me. Okay. Well, he just dodged that

10:10:05.720 --> 10:10:09.960
Uh, can you maybe attack him? Gee, Louise

10:10:12.280 --> 10:10:17.080
Oh my god, that was brutal. I just took his weapon from him and then uh ended him with that weapon

10:10:19.160 --> 10:10:21.160
Rather brutal, but I'll take it

10:10:22.440 --> 10:10:24.440
Restart time

10:10:25.640 --> 10:10:28.520
We will rock you

10:10:28.680 --> 10:10:30.680
Do

10:10:31.000 --> 10:10:33.000
None of you are a big boy

10:10:36.760 --> 10:10:40.760
You got mud on your face. Yeah, wait

10:10:41.880 --> 10:10:47.640
No, I was so close to being the tame. I didn't know I was deli dalyan

10:10:49.160 --> 10:10:54.520
I was deli dalyan so I didn't get 100% I can't believe it. I can't believe yapping has cost me 100%

10:10:55.000 --> 10:11:00.280
Oh, no, it results in me having to stream more. Oh, what a punishment

10:11:01.320 --> 10:11:04.120
We actually will open the chest because we're a bit low on funds

10:11:06.680 --> 10:11:11.080
Yeah, I saw you at the beginning last night and now in the morning you're still here. Good job. Thank you

10:11:11.400 --> 10:11:13.240
We finished the campaign

10:11:13.240 --> 10:11:17.400
Doing layers of romuli. We're going to unlock the special armor in this game

10:11:18.280 --> 10:11:21.320
Uh, not much treasures in these chests

10:11:22.280 --> 10:11:28.200
So close and yet so far such a fake assassin's creed. I know I'm actually an assassin's creed fake fanboy

10:11:33.160 --> 10:11:35.160
Oh, I can't believe it

10:11:36.600 --> 10:11:38.440
I can't believe I missed that by a ball here

10:11:38.920 --> 10:11:44.040
So say you missed something very closely in scots you say by a ball here

10:11:44.120 --> 10:11:48.120
Which means exactly what you think it is by a ball here because of how short they are

10:11:48.920 --> 10:11:50.920
So I missed it by a ball here

10:11:52.680 --> 10:11:55.800
Angie, Angie, take a sip. Please remember to hydrate

10:11:58.680 --> 10:12:00.280
Wow

10:12:00.280 --> 10:12:07.960
That cola is chris b is exactly what one I wanted my good morning burp so bad on his floor

10:12:10.360 --> 10:12:13.080
Imagine burping me after every time like

10:12:14.040 --> 10:12:17.560
Like patting my back. Wait, where the heck are we? We didn't start in here

10:12:18.280 --> 10:12:23.640
No, we were down here and now we're here. Okay. Are we closer to another layer?

10:12:24.280 --> 10:12:27.160
That is where we get the treasure

10:12:28.200 --> 10:12:31.960
There's one to the east. Okay. We will head east

10:12:33.080 --> 10:12:38.520
Never eat shredded wheat is how you remember your north east south west

10:12:40.200 --> 10:12:44.360
I won't lie. I've been studying a wikipedia list of scottish slang

10:12:45.080 --> 10:12:49.560
Oh, there's so much but a lot of scottish slang isn't

10:12:50.600 --> 10:12:52.200
used

10:12:52.200 --> 10:12:54.200
So you might be studying

10:12:55.080 --> 10:12:57.640
Too hard for the test that doesn't exist yet

10:13:00.120 --> 10:13:02.120
But I do appreciate it

10:13:02.360 --> 10:13:07.960
Uh, I do apologize for those of you whose english is not your first language

10:13:08.920 --> 10:13:15.960
I can be a bit mumbly and hard to understand but I do try my best to enunciate words on stream

10:13:17.080 --> 10:13:19.640
Just because my natural speaking voice

10:13:20.440 --> 10:13:23.480
I kind of sound more like this and a bit more monotone

10:13:24.360 --> 10:13:28.920
And it's no that i'm no interested or i'm disinterested but

10:13:29.640 --> 10:13:34.040
I just kind of sound a bit more like this and it doesn't really sound that exciting

10:13:34.920 --> 10:13:37.160
But it's not because i'm not having a good time

10:13:37.880 --> 10:13:40.040
It's because i'm a mumbly

10:13:40.600 --> 10:13:43.160
Bampot and I know i'm a mumbly bampot

10:13:43.960 --> 10:13:45.960
So i'm undoing that treat

10:13:47.720 --> 10:13:49.720
On the music the music is going to do the

10:13:54.440 --> 10:13:58.120
Glorious soundtrack glorious soundtrack

10:13:59.240 --> 10:14:01.720
I cannot recall of sassans 3 2

10:14:02.680 --> 10:14:04.680
Uh, it's you it's the lever

10:14:05.960 --> 10:14:07.960
Is it is it being pulled?

10:14:09.480 --> 10:14:11.480
Okay

10:14:11.480 --> 10:14:13.160
rude it's you

10:14:13.160 --> 10:14:18.680
I'm going to scotland later this year. You're gonna look for nessie. Are you gonna lock lomond? If you guys didn't know

10:14:19.560 --> 10:14:22.280
Nessie lives in lock lomond

10:14:24.120 --> 10:14:26.120
And it's totally not

10:14:26.600 --> 10:14:33.000
Uh, a capitalist ploy to get you to visit that location and support the

10:14:33.720 --> 10:14:37.640
Piring a boat and buying drinks at that location. It's not a ploy

10:14:38.680 --> 10:14:40.680
Nessie is real

10:14:40.680 --> 10:14:41.800
and

10:14:41.800 --> 10:14:44.280
Spend your hard-earned tourist money on us. Thank you

10:14:46.520 --> 10:14:48.680
Three week round trip. That's so good

10:14:49.720 --> 10:14:52.920
Blockness monster lives in lock lomond. Yes

10:14:53.640 --> 10:14:55.640
Oh

10:14:56.600 --> 10:14:59.880
Is this one? Okay. Okay. This one isn't bad

10:15:00.920 --> 10:15:03.960
Thankfully, there's no timer. We just have to not perish

10:15:05.240 --> 10:15:08.040
Can you swim with nessie as a weak cut off fish?

10:15:08.840 --> 10:15:10.840
Nessie was friendly

10:15:10.920 --> 10:15:14.200
Um, nessie means no harm lower wise

10:15:14.920 --> 10:15:16.200
um

10:15:16.200 --> 10:15:20.120
And as long as you are good and don't pollute

10:15:20.680 --> 10:15:25.320
Nessie couldn't give a hoot. Oh my god. That's the new motto. Thank you

10:15:26.440 --> 10:15:30.840
Tourism scotland. I have you a new motto as long as you're good and don't

10:15:32.200 --> 10:15:37.400
I've already forgotten it. What did I just say? What did I can you guys help me for meant for what I just said?

10:15:38.440 --> 10:15:40.440
If you're good and don't

10:15:40.920 --> 10:15:41.880
letter

10:15:41.880 --> 10:15:43.880
Nessie will like you

10:15:44.600 --> 10:15:49.400
Put put and I didn't even know it. Let's have already forgot I forgot

10:15:50.440 --> 10:15:53.640
I think there's a flag behind me. It's right behind me, isn't it?

10:15:55.240 --> 10:15:57.560
I knew it. I knew it. I remembered

10:15:59.960 --> 10:16:03.640
If you're good and don't pollute now nessie will like you

10:16:04.440 --> 10:16:09.800
Uh, there's nessie won't give a hoot. I'm so sorry. Wait. Is this not where I'm supposed to go?

10:16:10.680 --> 10:16:12.520
Oh this

10:16:12.600 --> 10:16:14.600
Wait

10:16:16.360 --> 10:16:19.400
I just came from here

10:16:21.080 --> 10:16:23.080
Am I not

10:16:23.400 --> 10:16:29.560
Ah, I understand. I understand. There's a way this way. I could not see it. I could not see with my eyeballs

10:16:31.880 --> 10:16:37.880
If you're cute and don't pollute nessie won't give a hoot. Yes. Nessie is cake. Nessie's not me

10:16:38.920 --> 10:16:40.920
Okay, we did it. Yeah

10:16:41.080 --> 10:16:48.280
Now these leaps look very big. That's because they are you have to hold grab while you do these leaps or it's you will not grab on

10:16:49.560 --> 10:16:51.160
Oh

10:16:51.160 --> 10:16:53.160
slow motion

10:16:54.840 --> 10:17:00.760
Nessie everyone nessie is ugly people. Wow. Wow. Wow. This is news to me

10:17:03.320 --> 10:17:05.960
That was crazy just coming out with that. Oh, there's a flag

10:17:06.760 --> 10:17:08.760
I

10:17:11.320 --> 10:17:16.680
Don't know how to get up there though. We'll do it later for now. We are just going to finish them

10:17:17.640 --> 10:17:19.640
and then

10:17:20.520 --> 10:17:23.640
Is that how I get up over there? No

10:17:24.680 --> 10:17:28.200
Oh, I jumped from there. Right. How do I get up on you? Did I claim your hands?

10:17:29.080 --> 10:17:30.840
Thank you for letting me claim your hands

10:17:30.840 --> 10:17:37.480
I'm actually going to grab this right now because we might be able to get all of them from this level since there's no timer

10:17:43.320 --> 10:17:45.320
Good catch. It's a very good catch

10:17:47.080 --> 10:17:50.040
You have to be cute and not pollute. Oh, I get it now. I'm sorry

10:17:50.920 --> 10:17:52.920
What's that? I already forgot me

10:17:54.200 --> 10:17:56.200
Am I supposed to jump over there?

10:17:57.160 --> 10:18:03.160
Ah, okay. Oh, okay. It was that way. I did. It did not look like I had to jump that way, but I guess I did

10:18:04.680 --> 10:18:10.040
It's nice that I can continue watching you from the stream last night. Heck. Whoa. I thought I was about to go up there

10:18:11.160 --> 10:18:17.960
I'm not gonna lie. I felt the gate brush against my butt. That's how close it was. My goodness. I was very nervous

10:18:19.000 --> 10:18:21.000
Oh oopsies

10:18:21.000 --> 10:18:27.400
Are you still no pan all this time? I'm so sorry. I don't know what that means

10:18:28.440 --> 10:18:30.200
I apologize

10:18:30.200 --> 10:18:35.480
Please may you give definition and re-ask the question kindly. Thank you. I appreciate it

10:18:40.360 --> 10:18:42.360
Uh, right

10:18:45.720 --> 10:18:47.720
No, panty. Oh

10:18:48.040 --> 10:18:51.960
Yeah, I never put any more clothes on I don't need to

10:18:54.520 --> 10:18:56.520
I almost jumped in there

10:18:57.320 --> 10:19:02.040
Yeah, I don't really like I'm gonna say something are a little gross

10:19:02.920 --> 10:19:08.200
But I don't go outside much. So, you know how like all the girls did those like smelly things

10:19:08.680 --> 10:19:15.640
I was gonna do like what my smelly thing is and it's like deodorant optional basically because I don't go outside much

10:19:18.280 --> 10:19:20.280
Which is kind of gross but I mean

10:19:21.080 --> 10:19:23.080
If you want the truth

10:19:23.080 --> 10:19:25.080
You can't handle the truth

10:19:25.400 --> 10:19:30.200
Wait, we must just go up or in no in. Okay. No up

10:19:32.120 --> 10:19:39.320
Is there a hidden thing back here? I keep thinking they're hating like a flag back. Oh, sorry. I wasn't paying attention

10:19:39.320 --> 10:19:42.040
I apologize to that startled anyone. Bye bad

10:19:42.920 --> 10:19:48.200
She's just like the cuttlefish mask. I'm sorry

10:19:49.000 --> 10:19:51.400
I just like if I need to go out

10:19:52.040 --> 10:19:54.440
Then like for example, I need to go buy those

10:19:55.080 --> 10:19:58.840
Sweets. Whoa, I see. Oh, no, it's just the box. I thought it was a flag

10:19:59.080 --> 10:20:04.600
Um, like I need to go buy those sweets. So I will get a shower and like I'll

10:20:05.160 --> 10:20:09.960
Put deodorant on and wash my hair like I don't go out greasy or anything, but uh

10:20:10.920 --> 10:20:12.920
I'm gonna be honest

10:20:13.720 --> 10:20:16.760

10:21:45.720 --> 10:21:52.840
We are for anyone who has just joined in I will do a quick recap. We are playing the greatest

10:21:53.720 --> 10:21:57.960
And undeniably the best game of all time assassin's creed brother hood

10:21:58.920 --> 10:22:03.000
We have successfully in our 10 hour stream

10:22:03.800 --> 10:22:05.800
Have endeavored to

10:22:06.760 --> 10:22:08.760
Complete campaign mode

10:22:08.840 --> 10:22:13.160
We have also bought all renovations bar any tourist stick

10:22:14.760 --> 10:22:16.760
Locations because of the price

10:22:17.320 --> 10:22:25.560
We ran out of money. Um, so we are now doing the layer of romulus which unlocks the special armor in the game

10:22:26.360 --> 10:22:28.360
Now this game came out in 2010

10:22:29.400 --> 10:22:33.640
And it has done very well. Um, it has done fantastic

10:22:34.760 --> 10:22:37.000
You're all breathtaking. No you

10:22:38.040 --> 10:22:40.920
Uh, we are going to climb over here very carefully

10:22:42.360 --> 10:22:45.000
We do have a bit of scary parkour so

10:22:45.720 --> 10:22:51.400
For anyone who does not like heights sadly this section gets even worse than this bit

10:22:51.960 --> 10:22:53.960
So if you suffer from any, uh

10:22:55.080 --> 10:23:00.760
You know, uh, how is it vertical when height makes you go woozy?

10:23:01.640 --> 10:23:05.240
Uh, not recommended that you watch this section

10:23:06.200 --> 10:23:09.720
Have you ever you are oh no, is mercy still online?

10:23:10.760 --> 10:23:13.720
Yeah, I think mercy's still online

10:23:15.000 --> 10:23:17.000
Did you have a good stream today azerah?

10:23:18.280 --> 10:23:20.280
I very sadly didn't get a chance to

10:23:20.920 --> 10:23:22.040
uh

10:23:22.040 --> 10:23:25.320
Watch any of it. Um, because I was too busy

10:23:26.280 --> 10:23:30.680
Uh, well, I was too busy is not the right terminology. I apologize

10:23:31.320 --> 10:23:36.840
I was streaming at the same time, but I did chat will vouch for me my little reeflings

10:23:37.480 --> 10:23:39.480
I did tell them

10:23:39.560 --> 10:23:44.520
To please enjoy your stream at will because I am an endurance streamer, and I'm glad you played the game too

10:23:45.160 --> 10:23:47.880
Yeah, well, you're all know your game crashed

10:23:48.760 --> 10:23:51.960
Do I need to teach you the in-video?

10:23:52.840 --> 10:23:54.840
framerate

10:23:55.480 --> 10:23:59.800
Uh, little thingy my bobber. I wonder why you crashed

10:24:01.480 --> 10:24:04.440
Hmm that pc. Hmm. I'm wondering

10:24:06.760 --> 10:24:09.240
Naughty pc we give it a few spanks for being naughty

10:24:10.120 --> 10:24:16.920
I can't wait for azerah ASMR. Thankfully, uh, I'm pretty sure I can vouch for your pc azerah and say it's not going to explode

10:24:17.400 --> 10:24:21.160
Uh, when you do ASMR because it's just you and the microphone

10:24:21.400 --> 10:24:23.400
Um

10:24:24.120 --> 10:24:28.040
We can give you white noise plugins as well if you would like to use that or if you want to just

10:24:28.680 --> 10:24:32.840
ASMR stream is ASMR up to me. I wish I was that pc right now for a throw

10:24:35.400 --> 10:24:39.560
We had fun chan. Oh, did you end up doing that too talking stream?

10:24:41.400 --> 10:24:44.280
Where do I go from here down? Oh looks like I go down

10:24:45.640 --> 10:24:50.840
Oh, did the gate open? Sorry. I'm too busy yapping the gate. Yeah, okay. That's swung open. Look at that

10:24:52.120 --> 10:24:58.840
Oh, it's even got the sound effects. You know, this area is given Elden Ring. I said it

10:24:59.640 --> 10:25:06.360
What do you mean that any sort of medieval esk type build is like Elden Ring?

10:25:07.160 --> 10:25:10.600
I can't believe it the Elden Ring allegations

10:25:11.000 --> 10:25:12.200
No, what was it?

10:25:12.200 --> 10:25:16.040
What was the meme game where everyone was like this game's just like oh dark souls

10:25:16.120 --> 10:25:20.680
That's it. This game's just like the did it is it of dark souls this game's like the did it did it of dark

10:25:21.720 --> 10:25:24.200
I almost jumped down. Oh, thank god. I saw the ladder anyway

10:25:25.320 --> 10:25:28.440
Yeah, I just talked afterwards. So it was yappy. Oh, that's good

10:25:30.120 --> 10:25:31.880
Yes

10:25:31.880 --> 10:25:39.000
Okay, we have collected the third scroll of Romulus only three more to go even though that says number five

10:25:39.080 --> 10:25:41.720
So I'm doing it in the wrong order. I didn't know there was an order. I apologize

10:25:42.600 --> 10:25:46.600
I thought the game kind of automatically like gave you this number that number

10:25:47.640 --> 10:25:50.280
I'm not going to bother with the treasure chest because it was just so little

10:25:53.880 --> 10:25:55.080
Wow

10:25:55.080 --> 10:25:57.080
Have a little separatism

10:25:57.400 --> 10:26:03.240
Gamers will see a Scottish castle and be like dark souls in real life. Can I tell you the dumbest thing ever?

10:26:04.440 --> 10:26:06.440
One man wreck in Korea. That's a good thing

10:26:07.160 --> 10:26:08.760
um

10:26:08.760 --> 10:26:14.360
Was it modern warfare had a map based in scotland like that castle map?

10:26:15.320 --> 10:26:16.280
um

10:26:16.280 --> 10:26:23.560
In my dumb ass played it and I was like, this is so weird. This map feels so Scottish

10:26:24.040 --> 10:26:26.840
and it was based after scotland and

10:26:27.320 --> 10:26:30.280
Yeah, it didn't click until like after I looked it up

10:26:31.880 --> 10:26:37.480
But I was like this feels so weird. It feels so Scottish. Why like why would they do that?

10:26:37.480 --> 10:26:42.120
And I was like, oh, it's because it's based after gotland and castle and stuff. Yeah

10:26:43.240 --> 10:26:49.080
Not very smart am I but yeah, I didn't I couldn't name the map out. I'd know it wasn't a black ops map

10:26:50.200 --> 10:26:54.040
Because I pretty much know all the black ops map names, which is really sad

10:26:54.200 --> 10:27:00.520
But is it sad if you enjoyed yourself? Is it sad? Oh, wow the bank has 31,000 in it

10:27:02.200 --> 10:27:04.200
Hmm

10:27:05.160 --> 10:27:07.960
Where's this Romulae? Is there a bank before it?

10:27:09.080 --> 10:27:13.080
Ah, there isn't a bank right? We'll go back and pick up our money and then

10:27:13.960 --> 10:27:15.960
we'll go

10:27:17.320 --> 10:27:21.400
He'd been college at ghost plausible. I did play ghost

10:27:22.600 --> 10:27:24.600
Very plausible. I shan't deny

10:27:24.600 --> 10:27:28.520
I'll send my assassins away again because there's no point in having the assassins hanging around

10:27:28.920 --> 10:27:33.960
When they could go be making like money and XP have we got another level eight? Yes, we do

10:27:34.920 --> 10:27:41.400
We've got two three level eight four level eight. So that's fantastic. Okay. The assassins are definitely

10:27:42.200 --> 10:27:43.960
getting very

10:27:43.960 --> 10:27:46.120
potent now. They are getting very

10:27:46.760 --> 10:27:48.760
Deadly which I'm quite happy with

10:27:50.200 --> 10:27:52.680
Stonehaven that sounds like it

10:27:53.560 --> 10:27:55.560
Yeah, me be me

10:27:55.720 --> 10:28:04.920
Very dumb and be like, hmm. You feel you feel so familiar. I wonder why I just can't I just can't put my tongue on my

10:28:05.800 --> 10:28:08.040
Uh, brain on why it feels so familiar

10:28:10.360 --> 10:28:12.840
I'm a dumb dumb, but that's okay

10:28:14.520 --> 10:28:16.520
I'm allowed to be a dumb dumb

10:28:17.480 --> 10:28:19.480
Dum dum you give me gum gum

10:28:19.960 --> 10:28:24.040
Oh, we're gonna watch night at the museum. I've not seen it since a child

10:28:24.120 --> 10:28:29.400
So I'm gonna be laughing my buttocks off. I think watching that maybe

10:28:31.160 --> 10:28:33.160
Maybe they do

10:28:35.160 --> 10:28:37.160
Man no problem

10:28:39.720 --> 10:28:43.880
Yeah, the map was every sniper heaven at heaven

10:28:44.600 --> 10:28:46.600
On sniper heaven. Yeah

10:28:47.720 --> 10:28:50.440
Wait, no, I need the money out of the bank. Goodness me. I'm getting distracted

10:28:51.400 --> 10:28:53.400
silly silly

10:28:54.120 --> 10:28:59.080
I learned once and I learned only recently that night at the museum had sequels

10:29:00.360 --> 10:29:02.360
I don't

10:29:03.800 --> 10:29:06.840
No, if I remember sequels

10:29:07.400 --> 10:29:09.400
Hmm

10:29:10.920 --> 10:29:14.360
Uh, hello horsey

10:29:16.840 --> 10:29:22.840
All right, let's grab this horse and we'll go for a midnight stroll on our little horsey

10:29:23.560 --> 10:29:27.080
And giddy up little I don't know what I would name a horse if I would one

10:29:31.320 --> 10:29:33.320
Uh, what do horses do?

10:29:33.880 --> 10:29:40.520
They gallop, let's go mr. Gallop giddy up giddy up bullseye

10:29:45.640 --> 10:29:48.440
Look at the speed of you you're such a

10:29:49.640 --> 10:29:54.760
And we've gone the wrong way, but that's okay because that was me that gated you there. So that's my bad. I apologize bullseye

10:29:55.720 --> 10:29:57.720
Little little little

10:29:59.480 --> 10:30:03.240
Oh, you're going so fast speedy Gonzales

10:30:05.160 --> 10:30:07.160
I would name a horse Gerald

10:30:08.120 --> 10:30:10.120
Gerald

10:30:10.120 --> 10:30:14.520
Horsey make horse face true. Are you a winning son? Absolutely

10:30:16.680 --> 10:30:19.720
I never lost yet I say that as I have like

10:30:19.880 --> 10:30:27.640
De-synchronized a couple of times now and done like 50 percent passing on missions instead of 100 percent synchronicity

10:30:30.360 --> 10:30:32.360
Where is it is it in here?

10:30:34.280 --> 10:30:39.160
No, it's just really awkward one. Um, wait, what?

10:30:39.800 --> 10:30:41.800
Is

10:30:45.080 --> 10:30:51.320
This this one I remember from childhood and there's a like invisible ledge. Yes

10:30:54.200 --> 10:30:55.960
Uh

10:30:55.960 --> 10:31:01.160
Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb. I thought the water was a lot higher

10:31:02.200 --> 10:31:06.040
You you didn't see that you didn't see me try to figure out how to get in water

10:31:06.600 --> 10:31:09.080
My pardon you're pardon. I beg

10:31:13.160 --> 10:31:15.880
Yummy, amicola. I probably have some water too actually

10:31:21.320 --> 10:31:26.200
Oh, what's this one do not lose more than 10 health squares they jumping me

10:31:27.640 --> 10:31:29.880
Because if I'm losing health squares is a thing

10:31:29.880 --> 10:31:36.600
Uh, I'm gonna need to be on my best behavior if I want a hundred percent this one and want to go

10:31:40.920 --> 10:31:42.920
They obey

10:31:45.000 --> 10:31:47.000
Bene, Bene, Molto Ben

10:31:49.240 --> 10:31:53.880
Followers of Romulus or Ujiparis. Oh my goodness. There's snowberries

10:31:54.760 --> 10:32:00.520
He he he I'm teasing I'm teasing I'm teasing and buzz-squeezing

10:32:01.000 --> 10:32:05.800
I'm num, num, num, touch my body. I mean girls. Oh, that's not the words

10:32:07.000 --> 10:32:11.400
This is the part where the rat breaks down. No one moves. No one makes a sound

10:32:13.800 --> 10:32:15.800
Back from reality. They go grab it

10:32:16.760 --> 10:32:18.760
I

10:32:21.600 --> 10:32:25.640
Hate I hate tailing missions when they can attack me. I'm so sorry. I get so stressed

10:32:27.800 --> 10:32:31.880
Yes, yes, yes Romulus commands the death of xy wild atory. Good luck for that mate

10:32:33.160 --> 10:32:35.160
Get your wee knife out

10:32:35.720 --> 10:32:37.720
And then wait for them to attack you

10:32:38.360 --> 10:32:40.840
And then just chain attack whoever goes up

10:32:41.400 --> 10:32:43.400
White is going to attack you next

10:32:43.400 --> 10:32:48.900
You can lock on to them first, or you can counter as they do it.

10:32:50.100 --> 10:32:50.900
No hit.

10:32:56.400 --> 10:33:02.400
Yes, okay, I understand now why the 100% was don't lose health squares, because these are a lot.

10:33:04.900 --> 10:33:08.400
Just wait for them to attack, and then counter, and then just go for it.

10:33:09.400 --> 10:33:14.400
And then we need to run because it's a chase mission.

10:33:15.700 --> 10:33:18.400
Well how do I do it? I'm just going for it.

10:33:18.400 --> 10:33:20.700
Oh that was lucky I even hit that.

10:33:21.400 --> 10:33:25.400
Please don't hurt me. I would like to get this 100%, so I don't have to play this one next.

10:33:26.400 --> 10:33:29.400
Oh, he injured me. Oh they're jumping me, there's somebody.

10:33:29.400 --> 10:33:31.400
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

10:33:31.400 --> 10:33:35.240
stop stop stop.

10:33:35.240 --> 10:33:37.040
Please.

10:33:37.040 --> 10:33:40.480
Please.

10:33:40.480 --> 10:33:41.420
Please.

10:33:41.420 --> 10:33:42.420
Please.

10:33:42.420 --> 10:33:43.420
Please.

10:33:43.420 --> 10:33:44.420
Please.

10:33:44.420 --> 10:33:45.420
Please.

10:33:45.420 --> 10:33:46.920
But how do clips work on YouTube?

10:33:46.920 --> 10:33:55.740
So if you clicked me, I can see what you clipped and then send it to an editor.

10:33:55.740 --> 10:33:56.740
Basically.

10:33:56.740 --> 10:34:01.040
There was the possibility of submitting clips on the Discord.

10:34:01.040 --> 10:34:05.920
But then people would have to have speed peaking permissions.

10:34:05.920 --> 10:34:07.480
Woo!

10:34:07.480 --> 10:34:09.200
Oh, I'm not ready.

10:34:09.200 --> 10:34:10.320
Oh, they're jumping me!

10:34:10.320 --> 10:34:12.160
Oh, that was like insane reaction.

10:34:12.160 --> 10:34:15.920
I just select the attack option in order to counter that.

10:34:17.800 --> 10:34:19.960
Oh, I had a little mini heart, right?

10:34:19.960 --> 10:34:22.840
I struggle with this area to know where to go next.

10:34:22.840 --> 10:34:25.760
I assume this little lamp is telling.

10:34:25.760 --> 10:34:26.760
Yeah, okay.

10:34:26.760 --> 10:34:29.680
This little light of mine.

10:34:29.680 --> 10:34:32.480
I'm going to let it show.

10:34:32.480 --> 10:34:35.880
Please don't leave my health bars.

10:34:35.880 --> 10:34:36.760
I'm jumping them.

10:34:36.760 --> 10:34:39.160
I'm just, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:34:39.160 --> 10:34:40.280
Oh, you can't see me?

10:34:40.280 --> 10:34:41.200
I can see.

10:34:41.200 --> 10:34:42.640
Can you get your gun out?

10:34:42.640 --> 10:34:43.560
Oh, I can see you.

10:34:43.560 --> 10:34:45.480
Get wrecked.

10:34:45.480 --> 10:34:46.800
Right, where am I going?

10:34:46.800 --> 10:34:49.080
Actually, let me get my wee knife out again.

10:34:49.080 --> 10:34:51.240
If it's all going to be wolves, there's

10:34:51.240 --> 10:34:53.880
no point in no having.

10:34:53.880 --> 10:34:55.600
I'm just going to get this real quick.

10:34:55.600 --> 10:34:57.600
Don't mind anybody.

10:34:57.600 --> 10:34:58.840
You're still going strong, eh?

10:34:58.840 --> 10:34:59.680
Yes, sir.

10:35:03.280 --> 10:35:04.960
Oh, there, hey, see that flag?

10:35:04.960 --> 10:35:05.840
We're going to get it.

10:35:05.840 --> 10:35:08.760
I'm getting up for the head of the event.

10:35:08.760 --> 10:35:13.680
I wish you could climb in this little hole, but you can.

10:35:13.680 --> 10:35:15.560
Pardon me, I'm sorry.

10:35:15.560 --> 10:35:18.680
For being so rude, it wasn't me, it wasn't my food.

10:35:18.680 --> 10:35:20.240
I say that as I've happened.

10:35:20.240 --> 10:35:22.600
Right, remit.

10:35:22.600 --> 10:35:25.240
Jesus, did not let me select a small knife there.

10:35:25.400 --> 10:35:28.000
Wait for them to attack, and boom.

10:35:28.000 --> 10:35:28.760
You just can't attack.

10:35:28.760 --> 10:35:32.880
Boom, boom, oh, I'm getting, oh, they're jumping up.

10:35:32.880 --> 10:35:34.880
And then boom.

10:35:34.880 --> 10:35:36.840
And yeah, they're guarding.

10:35:36.840 --> 10:35:37.960
That's fine.

10:35:37.960 --> 10:35:40.640
We are going to do crossbow bolts.

10:35:40.640 --> 10:35:42.200
Until they get too close, my goodness,

10:35:42.200 --> 10:35:43.360
they get close fast.

10:35:43.360 --> 10:35:45.200
Yeah, OK, OK.

10:35:45.200 --> 10:35:47.520
Well, what are you aiming at, SAO darling?

10:35:47.520 --> 10:35:49.600
Darling, they're in front of you.

10:35:49.600 --> 10:35:51.560
And I don't want to replay the section

10:35:51.560 --> 10:35:53.040
if I can get 100% first time.

10:35:53.040 --> 10:35:54.280
Thank you.

10:35:54.280 --> 10:35:57.200
Thank you, Etsy.

10:35:57.200 --> 10:35:58.360
Thank you.

10:35:58.360 --> 10:36:01.920
By the way, are you going to be playing Silent Hill?

10:36:01.920 --> 10:36:04.760
I am very sorry for those of you who

10:36:04.760 --> 10:36:07.640
might be interested in me playing Silent Hill.

10:36:07.640 --> 10:36:11.000
I'm under the impression Silent Hill

10:36:11.000 --> 10:36:15.000
are those games where you can't.

10:36:15.000 --> 10:36:19.440
Oh, that was really rude, and I don't appreciate that.

10:36:19.440 --> 10:36:21.160
Don't do that again.

10:36:21.160 --> 10:36:23.120
You've literally just put me in the water,

10:36:23.160 --> 10:36:26.000
and now my robes are drenched.

10:36:26.000 --> 10:36:28.040
Oh, I really don't want to desync.

10:36:28.040 --> 10:36:31.280
I think I still keep 100%, even if I desync,

10:36:31.280 --> 10:36:34.520
from trail distance.

10:36:34.520 --> 10:36:35.840
Oh, see, that's the problem.

10:36:35.840 --> 10:36:38.320
They instantly throw a knife.

10:36:38.320 --> 10:36:39.680
Bit of a problem.

10:36:39.680 --> 10:36:41.960
Bit of a problem.

10:36:41.960 --> 10:36:46.360
My goodness, they are on me.

10:36:46.360 --> 10:36:48.880
Oh, that's not good.

10:36:48.880 --> 10:36:51.160
Oh, that's not good.

10:36:51.160 --> 10:36:52.360
I think I'm OK.

10:36:53.360 --> 10:36:56.160
Oh, not good, not good, not good, not good, not good, not good.

10:36:56.160 --> 10:36:59.960
If you get knocked off, they can just spam throwing knives,

10:36:59.960 --> 10:37:01.960
essentially, just like what they're doing right now,

10:37:01.960 --> 10:37:04.360
but I think we're OK.

10:37:04.360 --> 10:37:08.560
Oh, oh, OK, we're good.

10:37:08.560 --> 10:37:09.640
We're good, we're good.

10:37:09.640 --> 10:37:13.200
Landed, literally landed in the water.

10:37:13.200 --> 10:37:16.680
Oh, goodness me.

10:37:16.680 --> 10:37:17.520
Give this to me.

10:37:17.560 --> 10:37:21.520
Me, I think we're on this last section

10:37:21.520 --> 10:37:25.280
of being able to be vulnerable.

10:37:25.280 --> 10:37:29.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:37:29.280 --> 10:37:34.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:37:34.480 --> 10:37:35.680
You're going to have to attack me.

10:37:35.680 --> 10:37:36.180
Ah!

10:37:41.160 --> 10:37:43.880
OK, that's fine, that's fine, let me cook you.

10:37:43.880 --> 10:37:46.000
Oh, see that, that's throwing knife.

10:37:46.040 --> 10:37:49.480
I don't know how to counter-throw a knife if you even can.

10:37:49.480 --> 10:37:51.880
Like other than, like, move a little to the left,

10:37:51.880 --> 10:37:55.680
so Tanzu's ult just moved to the left five head.

10:37:55.680 --> 10:37:57.800
I actually don't know if there's a counter-throw.

10:38:01.080 --> 10:38:02.960
Would you like to send any more?

10:38:05.920 --> 10:38:07.360
Fight me yourself.

10:38:07.360 --> 10:38:11.160
It is you who tell the people lies.

10:38:11.160 --> 10:38:13.360
Tell them lies.

10:38:13.360 --> 10:38:15.760
Give me the code sheet.

10:38:15.760 --> 10:38:18.040
All I will give you is death.

10:38:18.040 --> 10:38:18.840
Really?

10:38:18.840 --> 10:38:24.360
There's 20 dead bodies, and you think you can perish me?

10:38:24.360 --> 10:38:25.560
Good luck, mate, good luck.

10:38:25.560 --> 10:38:27.640
I'd like to see you try.

10:38:27.640 --> 10:38:29.960
Oh, oh, OK, we doing this?

10:38:29.960 --> 10:38:31.480
If you're just going to counter me,

10:38:31.480 --> 10:38:34.680
you're getting kicked to death.

10:38:34.680 --> 10:38:36.000
I ain't tolerating this.

10:38:36.000 --> 10:38:38.080
If you won't let me stab stab you,

10:38:38.080 --> 10:38:39.480
you're just getting kicked to death.

10:38:39.480 --> 10:38:42.160
There is no other option.

10:38:42.160 --> 10:38:43.400
I will put you in a circle, I'll

10:38:43.400 --> 10:38:44.800
hoof you in the balls until you're dead.

10:38:44.800 --> 10:38:47.520
Literally exploded your testes.

10:38:47.520 --> 10:38:49.400
I'm sorry to even put that thought in your head.

10:38:49.400 --> 10:38:51.480
I apologize.

10:38:51.480 --> 10:38:53.480
There is a flag over here.

10:38:53.480 --> 10:38:56.360
Do you want to know how to access it?

10:38:56.360 --> 10:39:01.160
You go for a little dive, and it's that simple.

10:39:01.160 --> 10:39:03.200
Why do I say it's that simple?

10:39:03.200 --> 10:39:06.200
I may or may not have got that flag

10:39:06.200 --> 10:39:08.520
after crying for 20 minutes.

10:39:08.520 --> 10:39:12.400
I'm trying to find it, and I'm pulling my hair out.

10:39:12.440 --> 10:39:15.920
I break his chances of ever having children now.

10:39:15.920 --> 10:39:21.080
I believe that's all in this room.

10:39:21.080 --> 10:39:25.240
I see a climbing thing up here, but I'm not sure.

10:39:25.240 --> 10:39:27.080
Oh, that's how you actually progress.

10:39:27.080 --> 10:39:27.920
My pardon.

10:39:27.920 --> 10:39:28.920
Your pardon, I beg.

10:39:32.360 --> 10:39:34.880
You used your cuttlefish powers to dive.

10:39:34.880 --> 10:39:37.160
Yeah.

10:39:37.160 --> 10:39:39.000
I cast mulch.

10:39:39.040 --> 10:39:43.600
I think mulch is still my favorite cast.

10:39:43.600 --> 10:39:46.080
I don't know if there's anything that beats it at the moment.

10:39:54.000 --> 10:39:55.960
We are now four of six.

10:39:55.960 --> 10:39:58.160
We are very close to unlocking the armor.

10:39:58.160 --> 10:39:59.040
What are we looking at?

10:39:59.040 --> 10:40:02.960
Oh, the clock is ticking for this mod.

10:40:02.960 --> 10:40:04.320
I shouldn't have looked at the time.

10:40:09.360 --> 10:40:10.640
I'm getting nervous.

10:40:10.640 --> 10:40:12.600
I don't want to get too close to the hell forever.

10:40:12.600 --> 10:40:16.280
I don't want it to explode in a fire for my vod.

10:40:20.160 --> 10:40:24.400
Nice money for doing the side quests.

10:40:24.400 --> 10:40:30.400
We're at 49 Florence, so we can probably invest in some,

10:40:30.400 --> 10:40:33.960
how you call, tourist attractions.

10:40:33.960 --> 10:40:35.840
I can't remember what their official name is.

10:40:35.840 --> 10:40:37.960
I think they just get named by what they actually are,

10:40:37.960 --> 10:40:46.080
because they are from the Oracle buildings and locations.

10:40:46.080 --> 10:40:47.880
I can't remember even.

10:40:47.880 --> 10:40:52.120
My cast is still streaming strong, hey, yeah.

10:40:52.120 --> 10:40:53.600
So I was like, go to bed.

10:40:53.600 --> 10:40:55.680
Oh, don't you worry.

10:40:55.680 --> 10:40:57.680
Oh, shit.

10:40:57.680 --> 10:40:58.920
That's just inhaled my spit.

10:41:08.920 --> 10:41:09.880
Pardon me.

10:41:09.880 --> 10:41:12.520
I didn't mean to cough.

10:41:12.520 --> 10:41:15.080
OK, Romulai, Romulai, Romulai.

10:41:18.080 --> 10:41:18.720
Can I see it?

10:41:21.560 --> 10:41:22.480
There's one here.

10:41:22.480 --> 10:41:23.680
That's quite far away, though.

10:41:26.240 --> 10:41:28.320
Oh, there's one in the Colosseum.

10:41:28.320 --> 10:41:29.080
I never saw that.

10:41:29.080 --> 10:41:30.560
OK, we're going to do this one up here.

10:41:33.760 --> 10:41:36.680
Obviously, your successor is going to still go in.

10:41:36.680 --> 10:41:41.800
You never met a girl with such stamina before, huh?

10:41:41.800 --> 10:41:43.600
It's a pleasure to be your first.

10:41:43.600 --> 10:41:46.320
I can't set the bow.

10:41:46.320 --> 10:41:49.160
I wasn't kidding when I said I'm an endurance streamer.

10:41:49.160 --> 10:41:52.920
As long as my voice doesn't crack and I lose it,

10:41:52.920 --> 10:41:54.480
I'm happy to stream long.

10:41:54.480 --> 10:41:57.440
No, obviously, it does depend on the game.

10:41:57.440 --> 10:41:59.840
If it's a game I don't like, then, yeah,

10:41:59.840 --> 10:42:02.840
definitely do not expect me to be on 12 hours for the game.

10:42:02.840 --> 10:42:05.680
But yeah.

10:42:05.720 --> 10:42:07.320
What's that supposed to mean?

10:42:10.080 --> 10:42:12.640
This is the longest a streamer has lasted for me.

10:42:12.640 --> 10:42:13.920
Wait, seriously?

10:42:13.920 --> 10:42:17.320
I'm breaking your first-time records?

10:42:20.080 --> 10:42:20.560
Will?

10:42:23.760 --> 10:42:24.720
I love long streams.

10:42:24.720 --> 10:42:25.320
It's so nice.

10:42:25.320 --> 10:42:27.000
Ah, I'm glad I can keep you company.

10:42:27.000 --> 10:42:29.160
Whether you're at work or you're bing-chinging, don't show

10:42:29.160 --> 10:42:29.800
me.

10:42:29.800 --> 10:42:31.880
Bing-chinging.

10:42:31.880 --> 10:42:35.480
I'm glad I can keep you company.

10:42:35.520 --> 10:42:37.840
My record is like a one and a half.

10:42:37.840 --> 10:42:40.840
Wait, of someone streaming?

10:42:40.840 --> 10:42:41.800
No.

10:42:41.800 --> 10:42:43.880
You mean how long you've watched a streamer

10:42:43.880 --> 10:42:46.800
when you say that?

10:42:46.800 --> 10:42:49.600
I mean, have you ever watched a streamer that's

10:42:49.600 --> 10:42:54.200
streamed more than like, what's the average stream time

10:42:54.200 --> 10:42:56.440
for a VTuber?

10:42:56.440 --> 10:42:59.280
Oh, that would be an interesting statistic.

10:42:59.360 --> 10:43:06.880
Average stream time for a VTuber is three hours?

10:43:06.880 --> 10:43:07.880
Two hours?

10:43:11.160 --> 10:43:13.520
I called in sick to have time to watch streams and catch up

10:43:13.520 --> 10:43:15.120
and go, stop.

10:43:15.120 --> 10:43:17.320
You're going to get in trouble doing that.

10:43:17.320 --> 10:43:20.920
You can't do that.

10:43:20.920 --> 10:43:23.360
Don't get yourself in trouble at work.

10:43:26.080 --> 10:43:27.800
The votes are always here.

10:43:27.800 --> 10:43:33.040
And I plan on streaming for a long time.

10:43:33.040 --> 10:43:36.360
My biggest concern, I'm happy to talk about this concern.

10:43:36.360 --> 10:43:40.440
My biggest concern with streaming was I wouldn't have

10:43:40.440 --> 10:43:44.640
time to stream and technically manage.

10:43:44.640 --> 10:43:50.840
But I've managed to get a script manager in place, which

10:43:50.840 --> 10:43:55.200
means that my only responsibilities are

10:43:55.200 --> 10:43:57.840
streaming for myself and arranging

10:43:57.840 --> 10:44:02.480
shorts for the girls to make, like,

10:44:02.480 --> 10:44:04.800
Mercy's shorts that have been coming out.

10:44:04.800 --> 10:44:07.760
I scripted them and got her to say them.

10:44:07.760 --> 10:44:12.320
And I don't know if you enjoyed her blonde one.

10:44:12.320 --> 10:44:15.320
Obviously, Mercy couldn't suggest talking

10:44:15.320 --> 10:44:17.360
about behind the scenes content.

10:44:17.360 --> 10:44:21.080
I gave her the script, she made it.

10:44:21.080 --> 10:44:22.920
And then I got someone to edit it type thing.

10:44:22.920 --> 10:44:25.080
That's my only responsibility is, like,

10:44:25.080 --> 10:44:27.680
organizing clips, basically, that go up in the girls'

10:44:27.680 --> 10:44:30.400
channels, because I didn't want them to feel stressed out

10:44:30.400 --> 10:44:32.400
dealing with that kind of stuff.

10:44:32.400 --> 10:44:43.040
The only problem is I'm facing the issue of clipped parts

10:44:43.040 --> 10:44:46.480
of stream turning into shorts.

10:44:46.480 --> 10:44:50.320
Because obviously, I don't have time to scrub through

10:44:50.320 --> 10:44:53.800
their content in order to find, like, a funny thing.

10:44:53.800 --> 10:44:59.040
So when you clip a girl's, one of the girls' streams, on the

10:44:59.040 --> 10:45:01.880
account, I can see what people have clipped.

10:45:01.880 --> 10:45:03.920
And then I can send that to an editor.

10:45:03.920 --> 10:45:08.000
So don't be afraid to clip something you like.

10:45:08.000 --> 10:45:10.400
Because on my end, I can see that.

10:45:10.400 --> 10:45:13.560
And then I can send it on to an actual creator of the

10:45:13.560 --> 10:45:16.360
clips, like, for a short.

10:45:16.360 --> 10:45:17.920
Did you see that?

10:45:17.920 --> 10:45:21.480
So I can get away with that stuff.

10:45:21.480 --> 10:45:22.960
Yeah, that's the only thing.

10:45:22.960 --> 10:45:27.360
I think your personal best is back-to-back 12-hour of odds.

10:45:27.360 --> 10:45:29.880
Yes.

10:45:29.880 --> 10:45:35.080
We're probably going to do it again when the DLC comes out.

10:45:35.080 --> 10:45:38.120
I'm not sure if we'll do the Butt-Bump adventure for that

10:45:38.120 --> 10:45:41.400
part, though.

10:45:41.400 --> 10:45:42.080
I know it.

10:45:42.080 --> 10:45:43.520
Wait, what was my 100%?

10:45:43.520 --> 10:45:44.680
I wasn't paying.

10:45:45.440 --> 10:45:47.480
Not another timed one.

10:45:47.480 --> 10:45:49.360
Stinky.

10:45:49.360 --> 10:45:50.640
I'm not going to rush it.

10:45:50.640 --> 10:45:54.000
I'm just going to go through it, so I know what we're

10:45:54.000 --> 10:45:55.000
looking at.

10:45:58.320 --> 10:46:00.640
Ooh, I remember this one.

10:46:00.640 --> 10:46:04.960
I have desynced DLC, downloadable content.

10:46:04.960 --> 10:46:10.240
The video game Elden Ring has official DLC coming out on

10:46:10.240 --> 10:46:13.000
June 19, I believe.

10:46:13.000 --> 10:46:16.960
And I plan on doing it multiplayer with you guys, so

10:46:16.960 --> 10:46:20.880
I will put down marks where, what the heck?

10:46:20.880 --> 10:46:22.360
What am I supposed to do?

10:46:25.640 --> 10:46:30.160
Unfortunately, I desync a lot in this.

10:46:30.160 --> 10:46:34.280
So I apologize if you're expecting perfect gameplay.

10:46:34.280 --> 10:46:35.520
It is not possible with me.

10:46:38.680 --> 10:46:40.200
I just realized what DLC means.

10:46:40.200 --> 10:46:42.200
It's downloadable.

10:46:42.200 --> 10:46:44.280
Wait, no.

10:46:44.280 --> 10:46:47.040
Downloadable content?

10:46:47.040 --> 10:46:48.640
Wait, that's not what DLC means.

10:46:55.920 --> 10:46:56.680
Yeah.

10:46:56.680 --> 10:46:57.720
OK, it does.

10:46:57.720 --> 10:46:59.720
I was like, second guess, because I was like,

10:46:59.720 --> 10:47:01.520
demo mode is one word.

10:47:01.520 --> 10:47:03.920
But maybe back then, it was two words.

10:47:13.200 --> 10:47:17.160
Stop moving around, ya bam.

10:47:17.160 --> 10:47:18.960
He just sold spells.

10:47:18.960 --> 10:47:20.760
It's been a pleasure, but I finally reached the end of

10:47:20.760 --> 10:47:22.400
my endurance.

10:47:22.400 --> 10:47:23.280
Not by my choice.

10:47:23.280 --> 10:47:24.640
Can't be short on my sleep before work.

10:47:24.640 --> 10:47:25.880
Yes, please rest well.

10:47:25.880 --> 10:47:28.320
If you guys have work, if you guys have responsibilities,

10:47:28.320 --> 10:47:30.960
please do not sacrifice your sleep or your

10:47:30.960 --> 10:47:33.080
responsibilities to watch me.

10:47:33.080 --> 10:47:36.080
I will be streaming all the hecking time.

10:47:36.080 --> 10:47:40.200
And there will be plenty of VOD content to watch.

10:47:40.200 --> 10:47:43.440
What?

10:47:43.440 --> 10:47:46.800
That was like two seconds.

10:47:46.800 --> 10:47:49.000
That was so quick.

10:47:49.000 --> 10:47:51.400
That was unbelievably quick.

10:47:51.400 --> 10:47:54.600
You know how earlier I quoted and said, this game is so

10:47:54.600 --> 10:47:56.040
forgiving?

10:47:56.040 --> 10:47:58.920
Wow.

10:47:58.920 --> 10:48:02.880
That was like instant red bar pool.

10:48:02.880 --> 10:48:06.760
I did not expect that.

10:48:06.760 --> 10:48:08.720
I apologize.

10:48:08.720 --> 10:48:10.680
I don't know how I was going to make that happen.

10:48:10.680 --> 10:48:12.520
First time watching the stream for this long stamina

10:48:12.520 --> 10:48:14.840
queen, I kneel, but I have to hit the bed.

10:48:14.840 --> 10:48:15.720
Please rest.

10:48:15.720 --> 10:48:17.320
Good night to those who sleep.

10:48:17.320 --> 10:48:21.080
Goodbye to those who have a few things to do.

10:48:21.080 --> 10:48:23.480
And get done.

10:48:23.480 --> 10:48:24.560
Yeah.

10:48:24.560 --> 10:48:28.120
Don't feel bad that you have to go do your thing.

10:48:28.120 --> 10:48:31.920
Whoa, no, my controller died.

10:48:31.920 --> 10:48:34.680
Oh, I can't play mouse and keyboard.

10:48:34.680 --> 10:48:37.560
Oh, it's not even registered in mouse and keyboard anyway.

10:48:37.600 --> 10:48:40.000
I'm going to have to go get my freaking charger.

10:48:40.000 --> 10:48:42.480
Wait, is this a charger?

10:48:42.480 --> 10:48:46.880
Oh, you spin me right round, baby, right round.

10:48:46.880 --> 10:48:50.880
When you go down, when you go down now.

10:48:50.880 --> 10:48:57.440
You spin my head round, round, round, round, round.

10:48:57.440 --> 10:48:58.640
Is there a charger?

10:48:58.640 --> 10:49:00.280
Hold on, I'm going for my cables.

10:49:00.280 --> 10:49:02.200
We are going to desync because of distance.

10:49:02.200 --> 10:49:05.080
I don't even think I have my charging cable in this dying

10:49:05.080 --> 10:49:07.320
room.

10:49:07.360 --> 10:49:09.440
Oh, I am so sorry.

10:49:09.440 --> 10:49:11.600
I'm going to have to like back out and go quickly,

10:49:11.600 --> 10:49:12.840
go get our charging cable.

10:49:12.840 --> 10:49:14.760
I'm so sorry, but BRB, I'll be a second.

10:49:37.320 --> 10:50:04.320
I can't believe I've played so long and drained my battery.

10:50:04.320 --> 10:50:05.240
Oh, no.

10:50:05.240 --> 10:50:08.040
Wait, what's that for?

10:50:08.040 --> 10:50:10.840
What's that wire for?

10:50:10.840 --> 10:50:11.320
Sugar.

10:50:14.560 --> 10:50:17.200
Sugar, spice, and everything knife.

10:50:17.200 --> 10:50:20.720
My headset is the front panel.

10:50:20.720 --> 10:50:23.360
And the second USB port is taken up by the controller.

10:50:23.360 --> 10:50:26.000
Hold on, hold on, let me get on my hands and knees.

10:50:26.000 --> 10:50:26.960
Can I stop myself?

10:50:26.960 --> 10:50:28.520
Can I?

10:50:28.520 --> 10:50:31.440
Is there even a port back here?

10:50:31.440 --> 10:50:33.560
Hello, is there a free port?

10:50:33.560 --> 10:50:36.880
I don't think there's a free port.

10:50:36.880 --> 10:50:37.880
Wow.

10:50:37.880 --> 10:50:44.560
Um, do I need some light for face tracking?

10:50:44.560 --> 10:50:47.240
I don't think so.

10:50:47.240 --> 10:50:49.440
Goodness me.

10:50:49.440 --> 10:50:52.000
I actually ran out of USB ports.

10:50:52.000 --> 10:50:59.680
OK, um, wait, no, I'm very dumb.

10:50:59.680 --> 10:51:05.520
I do not need the Bluetooth, the Bluetooth device is connected.

10:51:05.520 --> 10:51:08.840
I don't need the Bluetooth bit because I will have the controller

10:51:08.840 --> 10:51:11.680
plugged straight into the PC for charging purposes.

10:51:11.680 --> 10:51:13.600
Yes, I figured it out.

10:51:13.600 --> 10:51:16.240
One second.

10:51:16.240 --> 10:51:19.280
Well, I apologize for the unprofessionalism.

10:51:19.280 --> 10:51:21.520
However, I fixed the problem.

10:51:21.520 --> 10:51:24.560
Thus, I am a trust me, I'm an engineer.

10:51:24.560 --> 10:51:26.280
What the heck just happened here?

10:51:26.280 --> 10:51:30.920
Because trust me, I'm an engineer.

10:51:30.920 --> 10:51:32.880
I'm a very, very smart beat.

10:51:32.880 --> 10:51:34.280
Yay.

10:51:34.280 --> 10:51:35.680
Oh, have I desynced?

10:51:35.680 --> 10:51:38.120
Oh, oh, I desynced because I was out of range.

10:51:38.120 --> 10:51:40.080
That was a mistake on my part.

10:51:40.080 --> 10:51:41.000
Whoopsie daisy.

10:51:41.000 --> 10:51:44.480
OK, we'll try again.

10:51:44.480 --> 10:51:46.040
The all the holes are filled.

10:51:46.040 --> 10:51:48.120
Hey, yo.

10:51:48.120 --> 10:51:51.640
How do you run out of USB ports in this day and age?

10:51:51.640 --> 10:51:54.400
Nicola, wait, where am I going?

10:51:54.400 --> 10:51:57.640
OK, let's hopefully not desync this time.

10:51:57.640 --> 10:52:00.040
Because that was so aggressive, though.

10:52:00.040 --> 10:52:02.640
I'm wondering if that should have been patched.

10:52:02.640 --> 10:52:07.840
But because it was a layer of Romulus,

10:52:07.840 --> 10:52:11.440
like not a lot of playtesters got through this part.

10:52:11.440 --> 10:52:15.760
Because it was like the later content, like not main.

10:52:15.760 --> 10:52:20.040
So that'd be interesting.

10:52:20.040 --> 10:52:21.600
OK.

10:52:21.600 --> 10:52:24.480
Got the gold.

10:52:24.480 --> 10:52:26.440
I see you.

10:52:26.440 --> 10:52:31.600
I'm just an average man with an average life.

10:52:31.600 --> 10:52:32.560
Wait, where is it?

10:52:32.560 --> 10:52:34.280
Lost him already.

10:52:34.280 --> 10:52:35.960
Go in here.

10:52:35.960 --> 10:52:38.920
Please don't desync, because that was so fast.

10:52:43.360 --> 10:52:45.320
It's giving one thrust is all it took.

10:52:45.920 --> 10:52:51.760
Oh, I'm not hiding.

10:52:51.760 --> 10:52:52.760
I'm not hiding.

10:52:52.760 --> 10:52:54.200
OK, I'm hiding now.

10:52:54.200 --> 10:52:56.840
Don't do that again.

10:52:56.840 --> 10:52:58.000
You're scaring me.

10:52:58.000 --> 10:53:01.320
I think he goes over there.

10:53:01.320 --> 10:53:05.320
I'm wondering if I should beat him before he moves.

10:53:05.320 --> 10:53:07.280
Like this?

10:53:07.280 --> 10:53:10.600
I think he goes through that gate right there, dead ahead.

10:53:10.600 --> 10:53:11.640
So I'm.

10:53:11.640 --> 10:53:12.440
Oh, no.

10:53:16.120 --> 10:53:16.880
Distance.

10:53:16.880 --> 10:53:19.920
He's not that far away from me.

10:53:19.920 --> 10:53:20.920
I need to get back to work.

10:53:20.920 --> 10:53:21.680
Have fun at work.

10:53:25.680 --> 10:53:27.800
Please don't worry.

10:53:27.800 --> 10:53:29.800
Veal, what's their hard work in?

10:53:29.800 --> 10:53:30.920
Heck yeah.

10:53:30.920 --> 10:53:33.240
And you know what they get?

10:53:33.240 --> 10:53:33.720
Nothing.

10:53:33.720 --> 10:53:38.360
I actually feel really bad about that.

10:53:38.360 --> 10:53:40.160
Feels bad, man.

10:53:40.160 --> 10:53:40.660
Ah!

10:53:41.660 --> 10:53:43.660
Ah!

10:53:43.660 --> 10:53:47.380
Ah, that was not fun.

10:53:47.380 --> 10:53:49.140
Don't turn around again.

10:53:49.140 --> 10:53:52.420
Do I make myself clear?

10:53:52.420 --> 10:53:54.700
Yes, ma'am.

10:53:54.700 --> 10:53:56.700
OK, easy, easy.

10:53:56.700 --> 10:54:00.900
Take it easy, easy, easy, easy.

10:54:00.900 --> 10:54:03.940
Bit closer, bit closer, bit closer.

10:54:03.940 --> 10:54:05.180
He doesn't know.

10:54:05.180 --> 10:54:06.980
Chat, he doesn't know.

10:54:06.980 --> 10:54:07.580
He doesn't know.

10:54:07.580 --> 10:54:08.180
He doesn't know.

10:54:08.180 --> 10:54:08.780
He doesn't know.

10:54:08.780 --> 10:54:09.460
He doesn't know.

10:54:09.460 --> 10:54:11.860
He doesn't know.

10:54:11.860 --> 10:54:13.580
So what hurts him?

10:54:13.580 --> 10:54:15.100
He doesn't know.

10:54:15.100 --> 10:54:17.700
Wait, what he doesn't know doesn't hurt him.

10:54:17.700 --> 10:54:18.980
Yeah.

10:54:18.980 --> 10:54:19.500
Good night.

10:54:19.500 --> 10:54:19.980
Rest well.

10:54:19.980 --> 10:54:23.140
All of those who have to go, please sleep well.

10:54:23.140 --> 10:54:27.380
Make sure you deliver them convincingly with passion.

10:54:27.380 --> 10:54:30.380
My passion.

10:54:30.380 --> 10:54:34.420
Hey, hey, doofus, you're having a sad son following you.

10:54:34.420 --> 10:54:36.100
Does he now?

10:54:36.100 --> 10:54:37.060
They don't now.

10:54:37.060 --> 10:54:38.700
Do you have the key?

10:54:38.700 --> 10:54:40.300
Yes, ma'am.

10:54:40.300 --> 10:54:41.460
Ma'am.

10:54:41.460 --> 10:54:44.740
May the Lord be with you.

10:54:44.740 --> 10:54:47.660
And also with you, ma'am.

10:54:47.660 --> 10:54:49.780
I have a callus out.

10:54:49.780 --> 10:54:52.140
He is five.

10:54:52.140 --> 10:54:54.220
Remember the passion.

10:54:54.220 --> 10:54:56.140
Passion for passion.

10:54:56.140 --> 10:54:59.180
Right, I believe we can get caught now.

10:54:59.180 --> 10:55:00.060
Oh, god.

10:55:00.060 --> 10:55:00.820
You can't hear me.

10:55:00.820 --> 10:55:03.740
He has air pods in.

10:55:03.740 --> 10:55:04.240
Ah!

10:55:04.240 --> 10:55:07.820
Asasino, you will not get me.

10:55:07.820 --> 10:55:09.540
So this is the funniest thing ever.

10:55:09.540 --> 10:55:15.380
He's in full gown and all of that.

10:55:15.380 --> 10:55:18.220
And he's so agile.

10:55:18.220 --> 10:55:21.060
And I'm not being funny, but if you've ever

10:55:21.060 --> 10:55:24.260
worn a skirt before, it is so restrictive.

10:55:24.260 --> 10:55:28.060
I think I've worn a skirt twice in my damn life.

10:55:28.060 --> 10:55:30.300
Oh, there's jewelry down there.

10:55:30.300 --> 10:55:31.980
Not jewelry.

10:55:31.980 --> 10:55:33.340
Trita.

10:55:33.340 --> 10:55:35.700
A bit of Trita.

10:55:35.700 --> 10:55:37.980
These are one of the chase sequences

10:55:37.980 --> 10:55:40.620
where he doesn't actually get out of range of view.

10:55:40.620 --> 10:55:42.660
I'm like 99% sure.

10:55:42.660 --> 10:55:47.700
He actually holds back if you're taken too long.

10:55:47.700 --> 10:55:50.620
I've come out the wrong window.

10:55:50.620 --> 10:55:53.460
But yeah, he actually waits for you, which is very nice of him.

10:55:53.460 --> 10:55:55.900
I do appreciate when game devs do that.

10:55:55.900 --> 10:55:59.580
I understand for the immersion you might want to actually

10:55:59.580 --> 10:56:02.500
chase, but it's kind of nice not having your gameplay

10:56:02.540 --> 10:56:08.420
interrupted because of kind of like small things like that.

10:56:08.420 --> 10:56:10.260
I have to say Assassin's Creed definitely.

10:56:10.260 --> 10:56:12.340
Gameplay isn't horrifically interrupted

10:56:12.340 --> 10:56:18.980
if you're a bad player, which I do appreciate in video games.

10:56:18.980 --> 10:56:20.180
Oh my god.

10:56:20.180 --> 10:56:23.180
He said, no room at the inn.

10:56:23.180 --> 10:56:25.860
Mother Mary.

10:56:25.860 --> 10:56:28.460
No, little donkey.

10:56:28.460 --> 10:56:34.780
Carrie Mary, then the dusty road.

10:56:34.780 --> 10:56:38.260
I can't believe I've got the ninth sanctuary in a church.

10:56:38.260 --> 10:56:44.660
Did you know that if you went to a church

10:56:44.660 --> 10:56:46.700
and you were like a wanted criminal,

10:56:46.700 --> 10:56:50.060
if you cleaned sanctuary, they couldn't get you back

10:56:50.060 --> 10:56:52.900
in the old days.

10:56:52.900 --> 10:56:56.700
But now, if you're a criminal and want to get away with it,

10:56:56.740 --> 10:57:01.540
you just have to be super rich or no.

10:57:01.540 --> 10:57:05.460
And have blackmail on them, that's pretty much it.

10:57:05.460 --> 10:57:07.460
Sorry, I don't.

10:57:07.460 --> 10:57:09.020
Wait, wait, that was supposed to happen.

10:57:09.020 --> 10:57:10.500
OK, that was supposed to happen.

10:57:10.500 --> 10:57:12.180
I was supposed to split.

10:57:12.180 --> 10:57:15.460
I was like, oh, no, the camera angle's

10:57:15.460 --> 10:57:18.060
a bit funky for claiming.

10:57:18.060 --> 10:57:19.580
Oh, I don't like that.

10:57:19.580 --> 10:57:23.860
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

10:57:23.860 --> 10:57:24.780
The key camera angle.

10:57:28.460 --> 10:57:31.540
He is so agile for this old man pope.

10:57:31.540 --> 10:57:34.780
Are you sure you aren't in the fast on yourself?

10:57:34.780 --> 10:57:36.500
Well, this is getting a bit ridiculous, me.

10:57:36.500 --> 10:57:38.060
I'm going to, me.

10:57:38.060 --> 10:57:41.260
This is getting, I don't know what they are putting in your food,

10:57:41.260 --> 10:57:44.940
like what they're blessing the holy bread with.

10:57:44.940 --> 10:57:51.980
How on earth are you achieving any of these stunts?

10:57:52.020 --> 10:57:53.500
My goodness, what is in that wine?

10:58:01.500 --> 10:58:02.900
Oh, I'm confused.

10:58:02.900 --> 10:58:04.580
Where am I supposed to go?

10:58:04.580 --> 10:58:05.420
Oh, no, I missed it.

10:58:05.420 --> 10:58:05.940
Oh, it's the light.

10:58:05.940 --> 10:58:07.340
I'm sorry, it's the light.

10:58:07.340 --> 10:58:09.860
Literally, rule one, follow the light.

10:58:09.860 --> 10:58:11.020
And I couldn't even do that.

10:58:11.020 --> 10:58:11.900
Where the heck am I going?

10:58:11.900 --> 10:58:14.580
Oh, I'm getting so confused and turned around now.

10:58:14.580 --> 10:58:19.020
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

10:58:19.020 --> 10:58:20.460
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

10:58:20.460 --> 10:58:21.940
Right, there we go.

10:58:22.900 --> 10:58:23.400
Watch me.

10:58:26.780 --> 10:58:29.860
I didn't even recall him doing that.

10:58:29.860 --> 10:58:30.860
Where the heck am I going?

10:58:37.700 --> 10:58:40.460
OK.

10:58:40.460 --> 10:58:41.940
We've done it.

10:58:41.940 --> 10:58:45.460
We've done it.

10:58:45.460 --> 10:58:49.660
I can't wait to be rich to get away with things.

10:58:49.700 --> 10:58:52.580
What on earth are you even for?

10:58:52.580 --> 10:58:55.140
There's no order at all.

10:58:55.140 --> 10:59:00.460
Oh, is this he's going to counter me?

10:59:00.460 --> 10:59:03.780
Hey, right, you know what time it is, time for?

10:59:03.780 --> 10:59:05.340
You don't need this, anyway.

10:59:05.340 --> 10:59:09.020
You're devoted to God, so you don't even need this.

10:59:09.020 --> 10:59:10.940
I'm doing you a favor.

10:59:10.940 --> 10:59:13.460
And I'm probably, no, I'm not going to make the jokers

10:59:13.460 --> 10:59:15.460
too obvious.

10:59:15.460 --> 10:59:19.380
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

10:59:19.380 --> 10:59:21.980
Can I push him over the edge?

10:59:21.980 --> 10:59:24.480
Push.

10:59:24.480 --> 10:59:25.980
You saved me.

10:59:25.980 --> 10:59:26.980
Oh, my god.

10:59:30.980 --> 10:59:31.480
Oh.

10:59:35.340 --> 10:59:38.220
I must have subconsciously known

10:59:38.220 --> 10:59:43.460
that you could push him off the edge,

10:59:43.460 --> 10:59:45.780
because how on earth did I remember that?

10:59:50.380 --> 10:59:51.780
Oh, my goodness.

10:59:56.780 --> 10:59:58.580
That must be main story.

10:59:58.580 --> 11:00:00.780
You must always push him off the end or something,

11:00:00.780 --> 11:00:03.180
because there's no way I would have thought of that myself.

11:00:03.180 --> 11:00:04.780
I must have done it before in the past.

11:00:04.780 --> 11:00:08.580
I don't remember much of Romuli, because I don't do it.

11:00:08.580 --> 11:00:12.980
When I replay the game, I'm actually anonymous.

11:00:12.980 --> 11:00:15.980
I am wired in.

11:00:20.380 --> 11:00:23.380
Wait, did I do that in time?

11:00:23.380 --> 11:00:25.380
Is that 100% that?

11:00:25.380 --> 11:00:27.380
Did you hear about this?

11:00:27.380 --> 11:00:29.380
Did you see this news?

11:00:29.380 --> 11:00:30.380
I did!

11:00:30.380 --> 11:00:32.380
Okay, we don't have to do that.

11:00:32.380 --> 11:00:34.380
Are you sadistic?

11:00:36.380 --> 11:00:38.380
Yeah, I'm like, how would I have known that?

11:00:38.380 --> 11:00:42.380
But it must always happen plausibly.

11:00:44.380 --> 11:00:45.380
Easy clip.

11:00:45.380 --> 11:00:48.380
We've got one more layer to go.

11:00:51.380 --> 11:00:53.380
Catching a flight.

11:00:53.380 --> 11:00:55.380
Safe travels, Landstrider.

11:00:56.380 --> 11:00:57.380
Thanks for hanging.

11:00:58.380 --> 11:01:01.380
New outfit unlocked in the inventory menu.

11:01:01.380 --> 11:01:05.380
No, I haven't done anything to earn that, so that's not correct.

11:01:05.380 --> 11:01:08.380
Okay, the next location is Il Colosseo.

11:01:09.380 --> 11:01:11.380
I'm just going to check.

11:01:11.380 --> 11:01:14.380
I think my takeaway got delivered.

11:01:14.380 --> 11:01:18.380
So if you just give me one second, we are going to go to the Il Colosseum,

11:01:18.380 --> 11:01:23.380
and we are going to do the last layer of Romuli and unlock the armor.

11:01:23.380 --> 11:01:25.380
The armor looks pretty cool.

11:01:25.380 --> 11:01:29.380
You can see my health bars now, how I haven't invested in any armor at all.

11:01:29.380 --> 11:01:34.380
Once we get the armor of Romuli.

11:01:34.380 --> 11:01:36.380
Yeah, you're going like it.

11:01:37.380 --> 11:01:39.380
Give me one second just to check.

11:01:39.380 --> 11:01:41.380
I think it has been delivered.

11:01:44.380 --> 11:01:46.380
Let's go.

11:02:14.380 --> 11:02:15.380
Let's go.

11:02:44.380 --> 11:02:45.380
Let's go.

11:02:45.380 --> 11:02:46.380
Let's go.

11:02:46.380 --> 11:02:47.380
Let's go.

11:03:12.380 --> 11:03:15.380
Guess which fat bastard got a takeaway?

11:03:15.380 --> 11:03:16.380
Give me.

11:03:19.380 --> 11:03:24.380
I have a spicy chicken burger in chip and sprite.

11:03:24.380 --> 11:03:25.380
That's what I got.

11:03:29.380 --> 11:03:31.380
I'm going to take more drinks of water though.

11:03:34.380 --> 11:03:37.380
But we're definitely going to get the armor.

11:03:37.380 --> 11:03:40.380
I don't know if we're going to get anything else, unfortunately.

11:03:40.380 --> 11:03:45.380
I'm going to eat it now because I don't know if you have this problem

11:03:45.380 --> 11:03:51.380
with delivery where you're from, but the driver hangs about at the restaurant

11:03:51.380 --> 11:03:55.380
to try and get a double order, and then the food arrives cold

11:03:55.380 --> 11:03:58.380
because they've waited so long to try and get a double order.

11:04:00.380 --> 11:04:03.380
And it's so annoying, like it happens all the time.

11:04:04.380 --> 11:04:10.380
And yeah, I'm like 99% sure it's happened

11:04:10.380 --> 11:04:15.380
because that took so long from the last break I had to get here.

11:04:19.380 --> 11:04:20.380
That happens to you too.

11:04:20.380 --> 11:04:25.380
Okay, I've got chicken burger, spicy chicken burger and chips,

11:04:25.380 --> 11:04:27.380
and I've got sprite.

11:04:28.380 --> 11:04:30.380
Or my fizzy juice.

11:04:32.380 --> 11:04:35.380
They added the prioritise option.

11:04:35.380 --> 11:04:40.380
What, instead of just getting actually telling the drivers to deliver the food hot?

11:04:41.380 --> 11:04:44.380
That's pretty ridiculous, honestly.

11:04:48.380 --> 11:04:50.380
And hanging around.

11:04:53.380 --> 11:04:56.380
Sorry for those of you who don't like eating.

11:04:57.380 --> 11:05:00.380
I've been streaming for 11 hours and I need to refuel,

11:05:00.380 --> 11:05:02.380
and this is my food before bed.

11:05:02.380 --> 11:05:04.380
Literally, I'm going to brush my teeth.

11:05:04.380 --> 11:05:07.380
I'm going to check the girls are okay on the discord.

11:05:07.380 --> 11:05:10.380
And if all is good, then bedtime for me.

11:05:13.380 --> 11:05:18.380
I was up around two hours, no, four hours before stream.

11:05:19.380 --> 11:05:27.380
And then I managed to speak to Mimosa from Yumi Plus about the ASMR.

11:05:27.380 --> 11:05:30.380
But that was like one hour before stream,

11:05:30.380 --> 11:05:33.380
and then I had to send Clippers some stuff for the girls.

11:05:36.380 --> 11:05:38.380
But things are settling down, they're calming down.

11:05:38.380 --> 11:05:41.380
It's a bit chaotic, but you lead.

11:05:48.380 --> 11:05:51.380
A little bit busy, but it's going to calm down.

11:05:51.380 --> 11:05:54.380
And especially when the script manager comes into play,

11:05:54.380 --> 11:05:56.380
I literally don't have to do anything.

11:05:56.380 --> 11:06:00.380
So yeah, if you hate any of the scripts that the girls do,

11:06:00.380 --> 11:06:04.380
you're welcome to just send a marshmallow and be like, you suck.

11:06:04.380 --> 11:06:07.380
But yeah, I know, that's fine.

11:06:10.380 --> 11:06:12.380
But yeah.

11:06:13.380 --> 11:06:18.380
Hopefully for those of you who have never seen Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

11:06:18.380 --> 11:06:22.380
I may have given you a new opinion of the game.

11:06:22.380 --> 11:06:27.380
Or maybe I've influenced your opinion of the game.

11:06:30.380 --> 11:06:33.380
Better give them time out of time for me.

11:06:42.380 --> 11:06:44.380
It's so annoying.

11:06:44.380 --> 11:06:47.380
Like, I don't know when YouTube will fix that.

11:06:47.380 --> 11:06:52.380
The thing is, YouTube is slowly becoming like a much better platform

11:06:52.380 --> 11:06:55.380
to live stream on than Twitch.

11:06:55.380 --> 11:06:57.380
There's no doubt about it in my head.

11:06:57.380 --> 11:07:01.380
They are just so slow to catch up and implement things.

11:07:01.380 --> 11:07:03.380
Like, so slow.

11:07:05.380 --> 11:07:09.380
But I hope they fix that 12-hour reward thing.

11:07:09.380 --> 11:07:15.380
Because if they do, then strapping for 14-hour streams!

11:07:18.380 --> 11:07:21.380
Next paycheck, I'll pick up Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

11:07:21.380 --> 11:07:22.380
And two.

11:07:22.380 --> 11:07:23.380
Mmm!

11:07:23.380 --> 11:07:29.380
Actually, on Steam, you do require a Ubisoft account once you get it.

11:07:29.380 --> 11:07:36.380
However, on Steam, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is on sale right now for $5.

11:07:36.380 --> 11:07:39.380
If you have it on your account, I think you can grab it.

11:07:40.380 --> 11:07:42.380
But that's just for Brotherhood.

11:07:44.380 --> 11:07:46.380
I don't know about the odd guys.

11:07:50.380 --> 11:07:52.380
Sorry, I'm itching my face.

11:07:58.380 --> 11:07:59.380
Good morning!

11:07:59.380 --> 11:08:01.380
No, I didn't lie, I'm still here.

11:08:02.380 --> 11:08:07.380
I thought I was going to do 10 hours, but I'm like, ah, we can do more.

11:08:11.380 --> 11:08:15.380
Good morning to the sleepyheads and goodnight to the sleepyheads

11:08:15.380 --> 11:08:17.380
because you're all probably sleepy.

11:08:21.380 --> 11:08:24.380
It depends what you make for YouTube Discoverability

11:08:24.380 --> 11:08:28.380
for streaming-only content for Discoverability.

11:08:28.380 --> 11:08:36.380
Yeah, if you do Shorts, however, and ASMR, for example, then you can be discovered.

11:08:36.380 --> 11:08:40.380
I don't know about how Twitch's Discoverability works, unfortunately.

11:08:44.380 --> 11:08:47.380
It's 5pm here, I passed out most of the day.

11:08:47.380 --> 11:08:49.380
Sounded like you needed the rest then.

11:08:52.380 --> 11:08:55.380
I can feel deep vein thrombosis sitting in all right-

11:08:55.380 --> 11:08:56.380
Do you need to stretch?

11:08:56.380 --> 11:08:59.380
Maybe I should have told you to stretch.

11:09:07.380 --> 11:09:13.380
I'm eating all the chips first because they're getting cold.

11:09:15.380 --> 11:09:17.380
Twitch has very low Discoverability.

11:09:17.380 --> 11:09:19.380
That's what I thought.

11:09:19.380 --> 11:09:22.380
Whereas like YouTube, at least I know how YouTube works.

11:09:23.380 --> 11:09:29.380
For the most part, I say that as if Emmy didn't get a warning on YouTube.

11:09:39.380 --> 11:09:41.380
My brain's so American I thought you meant actual chips.

11:09:41.380 --> 11:09:50.380
Ah, um, deep fried potato in a vat, in a rectangular, skinny, rectangular shape.

11:09:52.380 --> 11:09:53.380
Yeah, man.

11:09:58.380 --> 11:09:59.380
French fries.

11:10:01.380 --> 11:10:04.380
Managed maggot, no, I'll get 100%.

11:10:05.380 --> 11:10:09.380
I thought that was my cup for setting this all up.

11:10:12.380 --> 11:10:13.380
Stinky management.

11:10:13.380 --> 11:10:16.380
Imagine if I got graduated by my own management.

11:10:17.380 --> 11:10:18.380
Uh-huh.

11:10:19.380 --> 11:10:23.380
Um, they're not flavor.

11:10:26.380 --> 11:10:28.380
With salt and fat, maybe.

11:10:28.380 --> 11:10:30.380
And maybe large oil.

11:10:34.380 --> 11:10:36.380
Is it management hate time?

11:10:36.380 --> 11:10:38.380
Oh, is it that time already?

11:10:40.380 --> 11:10:41.380
Scottish food stream.

11:10:41.380 --> 11:10:44.380
I don't even think I have access to haggis here.

11:10:45.380 --> 11:10:47.380
Which is a shame.

11:10:48.380 --> 11:10:53.380
But I'm doing a Scottish game show on St Andrews for the girls.

11:10:53.380 --> 11:11:00.380
I'm gonna like get them to guess Scottish memes or spell Scottish words

11:11:00.380 --> 11:11:06.380
or tell me what the, the Scottish phrase says type thing.

11:11:06.380 --> 11:11:07.380
Absurd.

11:11:07.380 --> 11:11:09.380
When I eat, I burp a lot more.

11:11:09.380 --> 11:11:11.380
I put all the junk in.

11:11:11.380 --> 11:11:12.380
I'm so guessing.

11:11:18.380 --> 11:11:20.380
School of rock.

11:11:24.380 --> 11:11:25.380
Okay.

11:11:25.380 --> 11:11:26.380
I finished my chippies.

11:11:26.380 --> 11:11:28.380
I'm now going to inhale the booger.

11:11:35.380 --> 11:11:37.380
I need to know what food places are good in Scotland.

11:11:37.380 --> 11:11:38.380
Greggs!

11:11:38.380 --> 11:11:40.380
That sounds terrible.

11:11:40.380 --> 11:11:43.380
It's a British UK chain called Greggs.

11:11:44.380 --> 11:11:52.380
And they do this thing called a cheese, bean and sausage pastry, pastry?

11:11:52.380 --> 11:11:53.380
Pasty.

11:11:54.380 --> 11:11:56.380
And, oh.

11:11:58.380 --> 11:11:59.380
It is.

11:12:00.380 --> 11:12:01.380
It is.

11:12:02.380 --> 11:12:04.380
You know, it's so good.

11:12:04.380 --> 11:12:08.380
I like the cheese and hamburger from Greggs as well.

11:12:08.380 --> 11:12:09.380
Very good.

11:12:09.380 --> 11:12:10.380
Very proof.

11:12:11.380 --> 11:12:12.380
Mmm.

11:12:12.380 --> 11:12:14.380
Tesco meal deal.

11:12:14.380 --> 11:12:17.380
They used to be three quid, but they're not anymore.

11:12:17.380 --> 11:12:19.380
Are they, are they 350 now?

11:12:19.380 --> 11:12:21.380
Or is it going on more?

11:12:28.380 --> 11:12:29.380
Oh.

11:12:29.380 --> 11:12:30.380
Hold on.

11:12:30.380 --> 11:12:31.380
Oh.

11:12:37.380 --> 11:12:42.380
I, because I laughed, a bit of dry chip went like up back my nostril.

11:12:42.380 --> 11:12:44.380
That was very painful momentarily.

11:12:44.380 --> 11:12:45.380
Ew.

11:12:49.380 --> 11:12:52.380
I've never had a chance to try protein.

11:12:52.380 --> 11:12:59.380
I believe it's cheese and chips.

11:13:01.380 --> 11:13:02.380
And gravy?

11:13:02.380 --> 11:13:04.380
I'm taking big bite of burger.

11:13:04.380 --> 11:13:05.380
Do you want bite first?

11:13:05.380 --> 11:13:06.380
Go, ah.

11:13:06.380 --> 11:13:08.380
You can get bite of burger first.

11:13:08.380 --> 11:13:09.380
Ah.

11:13:12.380 --> 11:13:15.380
Do you like, you're actually putting, oh yeah.

11:13:15.380 --> 11:13:18.380
A and W is pretty nice too if you get to try them.

11:13:18.380 --> 11:13:20.380
I don't know what A and W is.

11:13:20.380 --> 11:13:21.380
I'm sorry.

11:13:21.380 --> 11:13:25.380
Is it a supermarket or is it like a takeaway place?

11:13:26.380 --> 11:13:27.380
Oh.

11:13:29.380 --> 11:13:31.380
Oh, the burger club.

11:13:31.380 --> 11:13:33.380
Chicken burger.

11:13:33.380 --> 11:13:35.380
With crunchy lettuce.

11:13:35.380 --> 11:13:36.380
Mmm.

11:13:44.380 --> 11:13:47.380
Sorry, I've been traumatized for going, oh.

11:13:47.380 --> 11:13:49.380
I didn't know she was going to do that.

11:13:49.380 --> 11:13:50.380
I was like, oh.

11:13:50.380 --> 11:13:51.380
Oh.

11:13:54.380 --> 11:13:58.380
A and W is almost bust, really?

11:14:00.380 --> 11:14:02.380
Protein Canada mentioned, yeah.

11:14:02.380 --> 11:14:04.380
It's chips, gravy and cheese.

11:14:04.380 --> 11:14:07.380
And you can customize it with bacon, sausage, egg,

11:14:07.380 --> 11:14:09.380
or any food you can think of adding.

11:14:09.380 --> 11:14:10.380
Mmm.

11:14:10.380 --> 11:14:12.380
A and W is a fast food chain.

11:14:12.380 --> 11:14:14.380
They have good chicken burgers.

11:14:14.380 --> 11:14:16.380
Oh, I like chicken burgers.

11:14:16.380 --> 11:14:20.380
When I was a child, I got to visit America.

11:14:20.380 --> 11:14:21.380
Americaia!

11:14:21.380 --> 11:14:22.380
Hello!

11:14:22.380 --> 11:14:25.380
And I got to try McDonald's.

11:14:25.380 --> 11:14:30.380
And we went to Red Lobster.

11:14:30.380 --> 11:14:34.380
And there were real live lobsters in the tank

11:14:34.380 --> 11:14:36.380
that could be picked out.

11:14:36.380 --> 11:14:41.380
And we didn't like that.

11:14:41.380 --> 11:14:43.380
We're not used to that.

11:14:44.380 --> 11:14:46.380
And it's a unique thing.

11:14:46.380 --> 11:14:49.380
But I completely understand that markets exist.

11:14:49.380 --> 11:14:51.380
Obviously, there's fish markets.

11:14:51.380 --> 11:14:53.380
You go and they're live fish and stuff.

11:14:53.380 --> 11:14:56.380
All sitting about ready to get bought and sliced and diced.

11:14:56.380 --> 11:14:58.380
I understand that's how the world works.

11:14:58.380 --> 11:15:00.380
I would just have a soft little soul.

11:15:00.380 --> 11:15:02.380
I say that as I eat chicken,

11:15:02.380 --> 11:15:05.380
which is from a breed of chicken

11:15:05.380 --> 11:15:09.380
that purposely grows meat,

11:15:09.380 --> 11:15:11.380
weight at a really fast rate,

11:15:11.380 --> 11:15:13.380
and is probably no older than 12 weeks.

11:15:13.380 --> 11:15:16.380
I understand how hypocritical I'm being.

11:15:16.380 --> 11:15:18.380
I comprehend that.

11:15:18.380 --> 11:15:20.380
I do comprehend that.

11:15:20.380 --> 11:15:22.380
I've got to sleep.

11:15:22.380 --> 11:15:24.380
The Sandman calls me.

11:15:24.380 --> 11:15:28.380
The Sandman from Spider-Man?

11:15:28.380 --> 11:15:31.380
What kind of demons are you fighting?

11:15:31.380 --> 11:15:34.380
If Sandman is your nemesis,

11:15:34.380 --> 11:15:36.380
are you good?

11:15:36.380 --> 11:15:37.380
Do you need help?

11:15:37.380 --> 11:15:39.380
Are they jumping you?

11:15:42.380 --> 11:15:44.380
Sleep well.

11:15:46.380 --> 11:15:48.380
What's the Sandman?

11:15:50.380 --> 11:15:53.380
Is it that song, Mr. Sandman?

11:15:53.380 --> 11:15:55.380
Give me a dream.

11:15:55.380 --> 11:15:57.380
Bum bum bum bum.

11:15:57.380 --> 11:16:00.380
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen.

11:16:00.380 --> 11:16:02.380
Yeah, but who is Mr. Sandman?

11:16:05.380 --> 11:16:06.380
Is it Sleep Demon?

11:16:06.380 --> 11:16:07.380
Is it actually?

11:16:07.380 --> 11:16:08.380
I'll believe you.

11:16:08.380 --> 11:16:09.380
I will believe you.

11:16:12.380 --> 11:16:16.380
The Sandman is the one who puts fit...

11:16:16.380 --> 11:16:18.380
I ain't reading all that.

11:16:20.380 --> 11:16:21.380
Wait.

11:16:21.380 --> 11:16:24.380
He puts the sleepy sand in your eyes

11:16:24.380 --> 11:16:25.380
that make you go,

11:16:25.380 --> 11:16:27.380
are you trolling me or is this real?

11:16:27.380 --> 11:16:29.380
Sandman from the store?

11:16:29.380 --> 11:16:31.380
American stories?

11:16:33.380 --> 11:16:35.380
I have not heard of Sandman like this

11:16:35.380 --> 11:16:37.380
in this content.

11:16:38.380 --> 11:16:40.380
It's real?

11:16:43.380 --> 11:16:44.380
Okay.

11:16:44.380 --> 11:16:45.380
Wait.

11:16:45.380 --> 11:16:48.380
So, is the song Mr. Sandman?

11:16:48.380 --> 11:16:49.380
Give me a dream.

11:16:49.380 --> 11:16:50.380
Bum bum bum.

11:16:50.380 --> 11:16:51.380
Make him the cutest I've ever seen.

11:16:51.380 --> 11:16:54.380
Is that someone asking Mr. Sandman

11:16:54.380 --> 11:16:58.380
to give her a dream about a man she really likes?

11:17:00.380 --> 11:17:01.380
He puts gunk in your eyes.

11:17:01.380 --> 11:17:04.380
Okay, I'm starting to believe that's actually the lore.

11:17:07.380 --> 11:17:08.380
Yes!

11:17:12.380 --> 11:17:14.380
Today I learned.

11:17:14.380 --> 11:17:15.380
Okay.

11:17:17.380 --> 11:17:19.380
Is it like a story book

11:17:19.380 --> 11:17:22.380
or is this lore from the song only?

11:17:22.380 --> 11:17:25.380
The Sandman is a mythical character in European folklore

11:17:25.380 --> 11:17:27.380
who puts people to sleep

11:17:27.380 --> 11:17:29.380
and encourages and inspires beautiful dreams

11:17:29.380 --> 11:17:31.380
by sprinkling magical sander.

11:17:32.380 --> 11:17:35.380
Okay, that song makes complete sense now.

11:17:35.380 --> 11:17:37.380
I've never heard that story.

11:17:38.380 --> 11:17:41.380
I must love Mr. Sandman.

11:17:41.380 --> 11:17:43.380
Give me a dream.

11:17:43.380 --> 11:17:44.380
Bum bum bum.

11:17:44.380 --> 11:17:47.380
Make him the cutest I've ever seen.

11:17:47.380 --> 11:17:48.380
Bum bum bum.

11:17:48.380 --> 11:17:52.380
Give him two lips like roses and clovers.

11:17:56.380 --> 11:17:59.380
You've never watched Rise of the Guardian?

11:17:59.380 --> 11:18:00.380
No.

11:18:00.380 --> 11:18:03.380
I've watched Guardians of the Galaxy, though.

11:18:03.380 --> 11:18:06.380
Baby, give me one more chance.

11:18:08.380 --> 11:18:10.380
I eat more burger.

11:18:18.380 --> 11:18:20.380
Sandman's on Rise of the Guardian.

11:18:20.380 --> 11:18:21.380
That's cool.

11:18:21.380 --> 11:18:23.380
It was Rise of the Guardian.

11:18:23.380 --> 11:18:26.380
Sorry, I feel like every time you guys reference something,

11:18:26.380 --> 11:18:27.380
I'm like, what's that?

11:18:27.380 --> 11:18:29.380
Oh, what is this?

11:18:29.380 --> 11:18:31.380
I've never heard of this before.

11:18:31.380 --> 11:18:32.380
Hee hee.

11:18:40.380 --> 11:18:42.380
Is it like Power of Alanis?

11:18:43.380 --> 11:18:44.380
No.

11:18:44.380 --> 11:18:46.380
The Secrets of Alanis?

11:18:46.380 --> 11:18:47.380
Alanis.

11:18:47.380 --> 11:18:49.380
This may be the name of the movie.

11:18:52.380 --> 11:18:55.380
It's a movie with Jack Frost in it.

11:18:55.380 --> 11:18:56.380
Okay.

11:18:56.380 --> 11:18:57.380
Hmm.

11:19:00.380 --> 11:19:03.380
Where this Sandman, Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus,

11:19:03.380 --> 11:19:05.380
the Easter Bunny, and Jack Frost team up

11:19:05.380 --> 11:19:07.380
to kick the crap out of a Nightmare Demon.

11:19:07.380 --> 11:19:10.380
Ah, that sounds like a good movie.

11:19:10.380 --> 11:19:11.380
Hmm.

11:19:11.380 --> 11:19:13.380
Is it like Nightmare Before Christmas?

11:19:13.380 --> 11:19:15.380
I love Nightmare Before Christmas.

11:19:15.380 --> 11:19:17.380
We should watch Nightmare Before Christmas.

11:19:17.380 --> 11:19:19.380
We have so many things to watch.

11:19:19.380 --> 11:19:20.380
Life is good.

11:19:23.380 --> 11:19:24.380
Hmm.

11:19:27.380 --> 11:19:30.380
They put so much hot sauce on my boy boy.

11:19:36.380 --> 11:19:37.380
Hmm.

11:19:37.380 --> 11:19:39.380
Basically form an Avengers style team up.

11:19:39.380 --> 11:19:40.380
Yeah.

11:19:40.380 --> 11:19:42.380
I love Avengers one.

11:19:42.380 --> 11:19:44.380
I know it's cringey, but I like it.

11:19:44.380 --> 11:19:45.380
Hmm.

11:19:46.380 --> 11:19:48.380
Ah, the sauce is burning my face.

11:19:57.380 --> 11:19:59.380
Oh, she's buzzing.

11:19:59.380 --> 11:20:00.380
She's buzzing.

11:20:02.380 --> 11:20:03.380
Hmm.

11:20:04.380 --> 11:20:05.380
Wow.

11:20:06.380 --> 11:20:09.380
Oh, I can share my family's movie.

11:20:09.380 --> 11:20:11.380
On Christmas.

11:20:12.380 --> 11:20:15.380
The family movie is Trading Places,

11:20:15.380 --> 11:20:17.380
and there's booba in it.

11:20:17.380 --> 11:20:19.380
I used to watch it as a kid.

11:20:20.380 --> 11:20:21.380
Look, there's booba.

11:20:21.380 --> 11:20:22.380
Ah.

11:20:24.380 --> 11:20:25.380
Hmm.

11:20:27.380 --> 11:20:29.380
It's delicious.

11:20:30.380 --> 11:20:32.380
After all my hard work today,

11:20:32.380 --> 11:20:33.380
it wasn't hard work.

11:20:33.380 --> 11:20:35.380
I literally got to just gleam about

11:20:35.380 --> 11:20:36.380
my favorite video game.

11:20:36.380 --> 11:20:37.380
It's not work.

11:20:37.380 --> 11:20:39.380
I promise you, this stuff ain't work.

11:20:39.380 --> 11:20:42.380
If each of them feels like work,

11:20:43.380 --> 11:20:44.380
then...

11:20:46.380 --> 11:20:48.380
then I will give you the advice

11:20:48.380 --> 11:20:49.380
of just do what you want,

11:20:49.380 --> 11:20:50.380
and then it doesn't feel like work.

11:20:50.380 --> 11:20:51.380
Hmm.

11:20:51.380 --> 11:20:52.380
But oh wait, no, that's a responsible.

11:20:52.380 --> 11:20:53.380
I shouldn't say that.

11:20:53.380 --> 11:20:54.380
I'm not kidding.

11:20:54.380 --> 11:20:56.380
Is there a sneak peek of the Eat Sweet Stream?

11:20:56.380 --> 11:20:58.380
No, I don't even have the sweets.

11:20:59.380 --> 11:21:00.380
Um.

11:21:00.380 --> 11:21:03.380
I might have to get my nails did for it.

11:21:03.380 --> 11:21:04.380
Ah.

11:21:07.380 --> 11:21:08.380
Jamie Lee Biba?

11:21:08.380 --> 11:21:09.380
I mean Biba Lee Curtis?

11:21:09.380 --> 11:21:13.380
I used to think that Jamie Lee Curtis

11:21:13.380 --> 11:21:15.380
was Princess Leia,

11:21:15.380 --> 11:21:18.380
because I grew up watching Star Wars.

11:21:18.380 --> 11:21:21.380
So when I saw her, I was like,

11:21:22.380 --> 11:21:23.380
Dad!

11:21:23.380 --> 11:21:24.380
Like, I was a child child.

11:21:24.380 --> 11:21:25.380
I was like,

11:21:25.380 --> 11:21:27.380
Dad, why is Princess Leia's boobies on the tail?

11:21:29.380 --> 11:21:31.380
Um, basically.

11:21:38.380 --> 11:21:39.380
No, no.

11:21:39.380 --> 11:21:40.380
Okay.

11:21:40.380 --> 11:21:43.380
I don't think I can eat any more of the burger.

11:21:44.380 --> 11:21:47.380
It appears I don't have a large appetite,

11:21:47.380 --> 11:21:48.380
but I wonder if it's just because

11:21:48.380 --> 11:21:50.380
I've been having such a good time that, like,

11:21:50.380 --> 11:21:52.380
I did actually have that fruit,

11:21:52.380 --> 11:21:54.380
which fruit is actually really good for fiber,

11:21:54.380 --> 11:21:57.380
so maybe that's why I don't feel like eating the full thing.

11:21:58.380 --> 11:22:00.380
Oh, I'm such a skinny legend.

11:22:00.380 --> 11:22:03.380
Okay, let's finish up this whole layer of bromelain.

11:22:03.380 --> 11:22:05.380
I think I was gifted this game a long time ago

11:22:05.380 --> 11:22:07.380
and never ended up playing on it.

11:22:07.380 --> 11:22:08.380
Mmm!

11:22:08.380 --> 11:22:12.380
So, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the second

11:22:12.380 --> 11:22:16.380
installment of Ezio Auditory's story, The Assassin.

11:22:16.380 --> 11:22:20.380
Um, it's my favourite game of all time.

11:22:21.380 --> 11:22:27.380
Um, I can only recommend it if you like,

11:22:27.380 --> 11:22:31.380
kind of role-playing and you like games that hold your hand,

11:22:31.380 --> 11:22:33.380
like, it's perfect.

11:22:33.380 --> 11:22:35.380
We've finished the campaign already.

11:22:35.380 --> 11:22:37.380
We finished it a couple hours ago now.

11:22:37.380 --> 11:22:43.380
Um, and we're just finishing up a kind of side quest-esque sequence,

11:22:43.380 --> 11:22:48.380
which is going to unlock some very OP armor.

11:22:48.380 --> 11:22:50.380
It's a really good game.

11:22:50.380 --> 11:22:51.380
I do recommend it.

11:22:51.380 --> 11:22:55.380
I don't know if it's a game for a stream for the first time

11:22:55.380 --> 11:22:57.380
you've ever played it.

11:22:57.380 --> 11:22:59.380
I don't know, like, I mean, I love the game,

11:22:59.380 --> 11:23:01.380
but obviously it's really hard to tell, like,

11:23:01.380 --> 11:23:02.380
what kind of game someone would be into.

11:23:02.380 --> 11:23:05.380
And Emi, I know you said you weren't the biggest,

11:23:05.380 --> 11:23:07.380
like, strongest gamer, but you're like a weebo

11:23:07.380 --> 11:23:09.380
or a gamer-type thing.

11:23:09.380 --> 11:23:11.380
Um, but this is definitely friend.

11:23:11.380 --> 11:23:13.380
I would say Brotherhood's friendly to, like, new gamers,

11:23:13.380 --> 11:23:17.380
is once you understand the controls,

11:23:17.380 --> 11:23:19.380
but then again, I have played the game like a...

11:23:19.380 --> 11:23:21.380
Oh, I did not mean to do that.

11:23:21.380 --> 11:23:25.380
Um, but I have played the game, like, a billion times over, so...

11:23:25.380 --> 11:23:27.380
Can people stream through 12 hours on YouTube?

11:23:27.380 --> 11:23:32.380
Sadly, no, the VOD ends up getting really broken

11:23:32.380 --> 11:23:34.380
at the 12-hour mark, so I will be...

11:23:34.380 --> 11:23:38.380
Oh, I don't want to end...

11:23:39.380 --> 11:23:42.380
Oh, it's becoming my bedtime soon, though.

11:23:42.380 --> 11:23:44.380
Oh, I don't want to end.

11:23:44.380 --> 11:23:47.380
Right, well, very quickly do the last layer.

11:23:47.380 --> 11:23:50.380
I didn't realise how long it took me to eat that food there.

11:23:50.380 --> 11:23:53.380
I apologise. I should have... I should have sped that up.

11:23:53.380 --> 11:23:55.380
Sorry.

11:23:55.380 --> 11:23:58.380
Right, we will take a... this to the tunnel

11:23:58.380 --> 11:24:01.380
to go where we need to go for this last...

11:24:01.380 --> 11:24:03.380
to the Il Colosseum,

11:24:03.380 --> 11:24:05.380
because that's where we need to go last,

11:24:05.380 --> 11:24:07.380
and then we will get the armour,

11:24:07.380 --> 11:24:09.380
because that's why we have had a fantastic

11:24:09.380 --> 11:24:11.380
first official stream,

11:24:11.380 --> 11:24:13.380
um, debut stream,

11:24:13.380 --> 11:24:16.380
and the exposing wheeler and all that.

11:24:16.380 --> 11:24:19.380
Don't count, um...

11:24:19.380 --> 11:24:22.380
because I said they don't count, smile.

11:24:22.380 --> 11:24:24.380
Um...

11:24:24.380 --> 11:24:26.380
This is, like, actual stream.

11:24:26.380 --> 11:24:28.380
This is just me doing my hang.

11:24:28.380 --> 11:24:30.380
I know I said I...

11:24:30.380 --> 11:24:34.380
Oh! It's you! You can't just jump on folk like that!

11:24:35.380 --> 11:24:37.380
That's inappropriate of me!

11:24:37.380 --> 11:24:39.380
You're going to get done for that.

11:24:39.380 --> 11:24:41.380
You're going to get the jail.

11:24:41.380 --> 11:24:43.380
They're going to give you the jail. They're going to take you away.

11:24:43.380 --> 11:24:45.380
Eh, see, they need to do that again,

11:24:45.380 --> 11:24:47.380
because that was actually really scary.

11:24:47.380 --> 11:24:49.380
That was, like, a vampire launch.

11:24:49.380 --> 11:24:51.380
Like...

11:24:51.380 --> 11:24:53.380
What would Colosseum mean?

11:24:53.380 --> 11:24:55.380
Randomly tops.

11:24:55.380 --> 11:24:57.380
Literally, like, uh...

11:24:57.380 --> 11:24:59.380
Eh, see, that's dangerous.

11:24:59.380 --> 11:25:01.380
You're 35 minutes away from the travel.

11:25:01.380 --> 11:25:03.380
No, don't say that!

11:25:04.380 --> 11:25:06.380
Hmm.

11:25:06.380 --> 11:25:08.380
Uh...

11:25:08.380 --> 11:25:10.380
Uh, hold on.

11:25:10.380 --> 11:25:14.380
Uh, I'm using my thigh to run right now, like a five-head.

11:25:14.380 --> 11:25:16.380
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

11:25:16.380 --> 11:25:19.380
You can tell. You can tell I'm not using agile controls.

11:25:19.380 --> 11:25:21.380
Oh, it's on the outside. It's on the outside.

11:25:21.380 --> 11:25:23.380
Here, here, yeah.

11:25:23.380 --> 11:25:25.380
You walk past it when you actually deliver...

11:25:25.380 --> 11:25:27.380
Do the deliver the male one.

11:25:27.380 --> 11:25:29.380
Um...

11:25:29.380 --> 11:25:31.380
Okay, boom, boom, boom, boom. Already there.

11:25:31.380 --> 11:25:33.380
Already there!

11:25:33.380 --> 11:25:35.380
At least this, we're gonna get our armor,

11:25:35.380 --> 11:25:37.380
and then we are done, zoop.

11:25:38.380 --> 11:25:40.380
I cannot for the life of me

11:25:40.380 --> 11:25:42.380
remember what's behind this whole, uh,

11:25:42.380 --> 11:25:45.380
of this layer of Romulae.

11:25:45.380 --> 11:25:47.380
Romulus!

11:25:47.380 --> 11:25:49.380
Keep saying Romulae.

11:25:49.380 --> 11:25:51.380
Is it because of Star Trek? I'm saying Romulae.

11:25:51.380 --> 11:25:53.380
It is!

11:25:53.380 --> 11:25:55.380
It's because of Star Trek.

11:25:56.380 --> 11:25:59.380
I think he doodoo-ed Star Trek.

11:25:59.380 --> 11:26:01.380
Yeah!

11:26:01.380 --> 11:26:03.380
I also watch Star Trek.

11:26:03.380 --> 11:26:05.380
What?

11:26:05.380 --> 11:26:07.380
Star Trek Voyager?

11:26:07.380 --> 11:26:09.380
A bit of Deep Space Nine,

11:26:09.380 --> 11:26:11.380
and, uh...

11:26:11.380 --> 11:26:13.380
Captain Picard?

11:26:13.380 --> 11:26:15.380
I cannot remember.

11:26:15.380 --> 11:26:17.380
I wouldn't say Star Trek Original, but that's...

11:26:17.380 --> 11:26:19.380
I don't think that's right.

11:26:19.380 --> 11:26:21.380
Star Trek Origin?

11:26:21.380 --> 11:26:23.380
Bet that too.

11:26:23.380 --> 11:26:25.380
Would be Romulae.

11:26:25.380 --> 11:26:27.380
Yeah, that's why I keep saying Romulae.

11:26:27.380 --> 11:26:30.380
Instead of Romulus, it's because I watch Star Trek.

11:26:31.380 --> 11:26:33.380
Um...

11:26:33.380 --> 11:26:35.380
Oh, I wonder why you watch Star Trek.

11:26:35.380 --> 11:26:37.380
Oh, surprise, surprise.

11:26:37.380 --> 11:26:39.380
It's my dad, yet again, got me into it.

11:26:39.380 --> 11:26:41.380
I can't believe it. My dad's the reason

11:26:41.380 --> 11:26:43.380
why I actually have a personality.

11:26:43.380 --> 11:26:45.380
That is terrible.

11:26:45.380 --> 11:26:47.380
That's not nice.

11:26:47.380 --> 11:26:49.380
Don't say things like that.

11:26:49.380 --> 11:26:51.380
Assassin must suffer as we must suffer.

11:26:51.380 --> 11:26:53.380
I forgot

11:26:53.380 --> 11:26:55.380
what 100% was.

11:26:55.380 --> 11:26:57.380
Do not lose more than three health blocks.

11:26:57.380 --> 11:26:59.380
Easy, peasy, lemon,

11:27:00.380 --> 11:27:02.380
Please don't launch at me.

11:27:02.380 --> 11:27:04.380
Okay, there we go. We got the small knife out.

11:27:04.380 --> 11:27:06.380
That's all we need.

11:27:06.380 --> 11:27:08.380
Right, three health blocks.

11:27:08.380 --> 11:27:10.380
As long as they don't do throwing knives,

11:27:10.380 --> 11:27:12.380
then it's perfectly fine. Did you hear that stress

11:27:12.380 --> 11:27:14.380
when I had to counter that attack there?

11:27:14.380 --> 11:27:16.380
Okay.

11:27:16.380 --> 11:27:18.380
Come at me.

11:27:29.380 --> 11:27:31.380
Never.

11:27:31.380 --> 11:27:33.380
Never.

11:27:33.380 --> 11:27:35.380
Gee, that sure makes you look innocent.

11:27:35.380 --> 11:27:37.380
Not.

11:27:37.380 --> 11:27:39.380
Uh, again,

11:27:39.380 --> 11:27:41.380
I believe this is time,

11:27:41.380 --> 11:27:43.380
so I might try hard a little bit.

11:27:45.380 --> 11:27:47.380
I can't believe it.

11:27:47.380 --> 11:27:49.380
I'm such a sweat.

11:27:49.380 --> 11:27:51.380
Who goes there?

11:27:51.380 --> 11:27:53.380
Identify yourself.

11:27:55.380 --> 11:27:57.380
I was on him.

11:27:57.380 --> 11:27:59.380
I guess this sequence,

11:27:59.380 --> 11:28:01.380
you're not at all supposed to catch him,

11:28:01.380 --> 11:28:03.380
but I'm actually just such an MLG gamer

11:28:03.380 --> 11:28:05.380
that I caught right up to him.

11:28:05.380 --> 11:28:07.380
I literally could yank on his cloak like yaga.

11:28:07.380 --> 11:28:09.380
Thank you.

11:28:13.380 --> 11:28:15.380
Yeah.

11:28:15.380 --> 11:28:17.380
Oh, okay, I remember this.

11:28:17.380 --> 11:28:19.380
Yeah, there's like a party going on.

11:28:19.380 --> 11:28:21.380
Oh my God, that lag because it's loading the area.

11:28:21.380 --> 11:28:23.380
Jubilee Performers

11:28:23.380 --> 11:28:25.380
has an access database.

11:28:25.380 --> 11:28:27.380
I never sat in red.

11:28:27.380 --> 11:28:29.380
What's up with this game?

11:28:29.380 --> 11:28:31.380
Oh, what am I supposed to do?

11:28:31.380 --> 11:28:33.380
Am I supposed to follow in that way?

11:28:35.380 --> 11:28:37.380
Uh, right.

11:28:37.380 --> 11:28:39.380
Go up the ladders.

11:28:39.380 --> 11:28:41.380
Clearly, yeah, clearly he's going to shut down that wall.

11:28:41.380 --> 11:28:43.380
I'm so sorry.

11:28:47.380 --> 11:28:49.380
I bless your dad.

11:28:49.380 --> 11:28:51.380
Literally make me...

11:28:51.380 --> 11:28:53.380
Oh no, I've never correctly done this

11:28:53.380 --> 11:28:55.380
horse sequence.

11:28:55.380 --> 11:28:57.380
I just want you all to know.

11:28:57.380 --> 11:28:59.380
So you can catch him in this sequence.

11:28:59.380 --> 11:29:01.380
I never seem to catch up.

11:29:01.380 --> 11:29:03.380
I don't know what I'm supposed to do

11:29:03.380 --> 11:29:05.380
to make it happen.

11:29:05.380 --> 11:29:07.380
Um,

11:29:07.380 --> 11:29:09.380
but yeah.

11:29:09.380 --> 11:29:11.380
Gee, I wonder why I've never made the sequence.

11:29:11.380 --> 11:29:13.380
Me who does that.

11:29:13.380 --> 11:29:15.380
I'm like pretty sure at the end

11:29:15.380 --> 11:29:17.380
you're supposed to be able to jump on him

11:29:17.380 --> 11:29:19.380
and I never make the timing.

11:29:19.380 --> 11:29:21.380
It doesn't matter what happens.

11:29:21.380 --> 11:29:23.380
Oh,

11:29:23.380 --> 11:29:25.380
Gee, I wonder why I never catch up to him.

11:29:25.380 --> 11:29:27.380
Surely it's a mystery.

11:29:27.380 --> 11:29:29.380
No one

11:29:29.380 --> 11:29:31.380
can solve this mathematical equation

11:29:31.380 --> 11:29:33.380
as to why I've never caught up

11:29:33.380 --> 11:29:35.380
with this guy.

11:29:35.380 --> 11:29:37.380
Right, this is when I'm supposed to be able to do it.

11:29:41.380 --> 11:29:43.380
Hi Jack.

11:29:43.380 --> 11:29:45.380
Please.

11:29:45.380 --> 11:29:47.380
What is go...

11:29:51.380 --> 11:29:53.380
Exio?

11:29:53.380 --> 11:29:55.380
Exio.

11:29:55.380 --> 11:29:57.380
Son.

11:29:57.380 --> 11:29:59.380
Son, do you want to talk about what just happened

11:29:59.380 --> 11:30:01.380
or are we just going to pretend that didn't occur?

11:30:03.380 --> 11:30:05.380
It'll literally...

11:30:05.380 --> 11:30:07.380
Oh, I do not want to get in a fight with him.

11:30:07.380 --> 11:30:09.380
So we're just going to sneak on by.

11:30:09.380 --> 11:30:11.380
Sneak on by.

11:30:15.380 --> 11:30:17.380
Oh, we've been here before.

11:30:17.380 --> 11:30:19.380
We have been here before.

11:30:19.380 --> 11:30:21.380
Wee.

11:30:25.380 --> 11:30:27.380
Eh?

11:30:27.380 --> 11:30:29.380
I knew under the stairs

11:30:29.380 --> 11:30:31.380
looked like a game,

11:30:31.380 --> 11:30:33.380
like an addition.

11:30:33.380 --> 11:30:35.380
I knew it.

11:30:35.380 --> 11:30:37.380
I forgot.

11:30:37.380 --> 11:30:39.380
Ah.

11:30:39.380 --> 11:30:41.380
I knew under the stairs

11:30:41.380 --> 11:30:43.380
it looked like there was something there.

11:30:43.380 --> 11:30:45.380
Oh my god, I'm actually just...

11:30:45.380 --> 11:30:47.380
I'm just so smart like that,

11:30:47.380 --> 11:30:49.380
like seriously for real for real.

11:30:49.380 --> 11:30:51.380
Did Exio just

11:30:51.380 --> 11:30:53.380
stuff him in his pocket?

11:30:53.380 --> 11:30:55.380
Literally.

11:30:55.380 --> 11:30:57.380
We did it!

11:30:57.380 --> 11:30:59.380
We got the armor.

11:30:59.380 --> 11:31:01.380
Codex sheet acquired.

11:31:01.380 --> 11:31:03.380
Return to room.

11:31:09.380 --> 11:31:11.380
Galaticator.

11:31:11.380 --> 11:31:13.380
On the escalator.

11:31:13.380 --> 11:31:15.380
On the escalator.

11:31:15.380 --> 11:31:17.380
Animal crossing villager attack.

11:31:19.380 --> 11:31:21.380
I did it! We did it!

11:31:21.380 --> 11:31:23.380
No, I'm going to show you where

11:31:23.380 --> 11:31:25.380
the treasure room

11:31:25.380 --> 11:31:27.380
is hidden. It took me a very long time

11:31:27.380 --> 11:31:29.380
on my first playthrough to figure out

11:31:29.380 --> 11:31:31.380
where on Earth this treasure room was.

11:31:31.380 --> 11:31:33.380
Have you seen the movie Gladiator?

11:31:33.380 --> 11:31:35.380
I haven't!

11:31:35.380 --> 11:31:37.380
You want to watch this together

11:31:37.380 --> 11:31:39.380
sometime with me?

11:31:39.380 --> 11:31:41.380
What happens if we

11:31:41.380 --> 11:31:43.380
did lots of

11:31:43.380 --> 11:31:45.380
watch-alongs of all the movies I haven't seen?

11:31:45.380 --> 11:31:47.380
Because I haven't seen a lot of mainstream

11:31:47.380 --> 11:31:49.380
movies.

11:31:49.380 --> 11:31:51.380
Because I'm

11:31:51.380 --> 11:31:53.380
a gamer and I kind of just play

11:31:53.380 --> 11:31:55.380
games and that's all I do.

11:31:55.380 --> 11:31:57.380
I don't really watch much

11:31:57.380 --> 11:31:59.380
anime.

11:31:59.380 --> 11:32:01.380
And I hope that's not

11:32:01.380 --> 11:32:03.380
disappointing to anyone, but

11:32:03.380 --> 11:32:05.380
I think it's good that all of us have a mix.

11:32:05.380 --> 11:32:07.380
Some of us are clearly a weeble

11:32:07.380 --> 11:32:09.380
gamer type thing.

11:32:09.380 --> 11:32:11.380
My strength is like

11:32:11.380 --> 11:32:13.380
strength in quotation marks.

11:32:13.380 --> 11:32:15.380
My strength is that I can play

11:32:15.380 --> 11:32:17.380
games.

11:32:17.380 --> 11:32:19.380
No strongy.

11:32:19.380 --> 11:32:21.380
That's not what strength means.

11:32:21.380 --> 11:32:23.380
However,

11:32:23.380 --> 11:32:25.380
my

11:32:25.380 --> 11:32:27.380
accolades,

11:32:27.380 --> 11:32:29.380
I just always enjoyed gaming.

11:32:29.380 --> 11:32:31.380
I did get very lucky.

11:32:31.380 --> 11:32:33.380
I've heard some stories from

11:32:33.380 --> 11:32:35.380
girls being like,

11:32:35.380 --> 11:32:37.380
their parents actively discouraged them

11:32:37.380 --> 11:32:39.380
from gaming and I'm like

11:32:39.380 --> 11:32:41.380
I just feel so bad

11:32:41.380 --> 11:32:43.380
because I am very

11:32:43.380 --> 11:32:45.380
lucky and I get so much enjoyment.

11:32:45.380 --> 11:32:47.380
So much enjoyment

11:32:47.380 --> 11:32:49.380
out of the games that I'm about to

11:32:49.380 --> 11:32:51.380
sneeze about to play.

11:32:51.380 --> 11:32:53.380
I just went away because I called it out.

11:32:53.380 --> 11:32:55.380
I have absolutely no idea

11:32:55.380 --> 11:32:57.380
where I'm trying to go to get to this.

11:32:57.380 --> 11:32:59.380
Okay, I just need to go around the hill.

11:32:59.380 --> 11:33:01.380
It's fine.

11:33:01.380 --> 11:33:03.380
I've heard some stories about girls being

11:33:03.380 --> 11:33:05.380
like I just called it out.

11:33:05.380 --> 11:33:07.380
It's just such a shame.

11:33:07.380 --> 11:33:09.380
Actually, you know what?

11:33:09.380 --> 11:33:11.380
I take that back.

11:33:11.380 --> 11:33:13.380
I've also heard stories from guys

11:33:13.380 --> 11:33:15.380
like their parents are like,

11:33:15.380 --> 11:33:17.380
you're just wasting your life on games.

11:33:17.380 --> 11:33:19.380
What am I supposed to do as a pastime

11:33:19.380 --> 11:33:21.380
in a hobby? Everyone has something

11:33:21.380 --> 11:33:23.380
that helps them get through the day.

11:33:23.380 --> 11:33:25.380
I'm not being funny.

11:33:25.380 --> 11:33:27.380
I'm really happy to get into the subject

11:33:27.380 --> 11:33:29.380
of how humans

11:33:29.380 --> 11:33:31.380
recreationally need to deal

11:33:31.380 --> 11:33:33.380
with daily working life.

11:33:33.380 --> 11:33:35.380
So some people use drinking.

11:33:35.380 --> 11:33:37.380
Some people use smoking.

11:33:37.380 --> 11:33:39.380
Some people use recreational drugs

11:33:39.380 --> 11:33:41.380
in order to cope with the stresses of the day.

11:33:41.380 --> 11:33:43.380
And like

11:33:43.380 --> 11:33:45.380
folk who act like

11:33:45.380 --> 11:33:47.380
gay men is like this.

11:33:47.380 --> 11:33:49.380
Oh, by the way, this is where the treasure room is hiding.

11:33:49.380 --> 11:33:51.380
It doesn't look like it, but in this little room

11:33:51.380 --> 11:33:53.380
where you kill the captain for this

11:33:53.380 --> 11:33:55.380
bourgeois area, you

11:33:55.380 --> 11:33:57.380
climb up and then you find the treasure room.

11:33:57.380 --> 11:33:59.380
Um...

11:33:59.380 --> 11:34:01.380
And like, literally, I find it like such a shame

11:34:01.380 --> 11:34:03.380
because like,

11:34:03.380 --> 11:34:05.380
you don't really realize how supportive your parents are

11:34:05.380 --> 11:34:07.380
until you get told stories.

11:34:07.380 --> 11:34:09.380
Right, I'll show up, because it's big.

11:34:14.380 --> 11:34:16.380
Wow!

11:34:17.380 --> 11:34:19.380
It looks like shade.

11:34:19.380 --> 11:34:21.380
Honestly, this is pretty bad.

11:34:22.380 --> 11:34:24.380
I mean, it looks good, but it looks bad.

11:34:24.380 --> 11:34:26.380
At the same time.

11:34:28.380 --> 11:34:30.380
Oh, Jesus.

11:34:31.380 --> 11:34:33.380
I mean...

11:34:33.380 --> 11:34:35.380
I mean, it's alright.

11:34:36.380 --> 11:34:38.380
I don't...

11:34:38.380 --> 11:34:40.380
I much prefer alpires.

11:34:40.380 --> 11:34:42.380
Armor.

11:34:42.380 --> 11:34:44.380
From AC-1. AC-2.

11:34:44.380 --> 11:34:46.380
Um, when you unlock all the seals.

11:34:47.380 --> 11:34:49.380
Germans? Oh!

11:34:49.380 --> 11:34:51.380
I read that as

11:34:51.380 --> 11:34:53.380
Germans truly are the most repressed group in society.

11:34:53.380 --> 11:34:55.380
Gamers are the most repressed

11:34:55.380 --> 11:34:58.380
group in society. Even alcohol and smokers get more, right?

11:34:58.380 --> 11:35:00.380
Yeah, literally, games are the reason

11:35:00.380 --> 11:35:02.380
why you can use the right side of my body like normal.

11:35:02.380 --> 11:35:04.380
Yeah, like, everyone

11:35:04.380 --> 11:35:06.380
needs something that helps them de-stress

11:35:06.380 --> 11:35:08.380
from daily life.

11:35:08.380 --> 11:35:10.380
And like, I just feel so sad that people

11:35:10.380 --> 11:35:12.380
like, genuinely have like...

11:35:13.380 --> 11:35:15.380
I suppose if you get into the conversation

11:35:15.380 --> 11:35:17.380
of like, loved ones and...

11:35:19.380 --> 11:35:21.380
Like, nothing they have to support

11:35:21.380 --> 11:35:23.380
everything you do, like, that's not how it works in the real world.

11:35:23.380 --> 11:35:26.380
But like, I don't know, I just...

11:35:26.380 --> 11:35:28.380
I couldn't imagine

11:35:28.380 --> 11:35:30.380
like, my mom and dad

11:35:30.380 --> 11:35:32.380
being like...

11:35:33.380 --> 11:35:35.380
Or...

11:35:35.380 --> 11:35:37.380
like, you're on the Xbox.

11:35:37.380 --> 11:35:39.380
Well, actually, so they did kind of say that, but

11:35:39.380 --> 11:35:41.380
I was having problems with social anxiety and all that

11:35:41.380 --> 11:35:43.380
and I couldn't go outside in that. So that's different.

11:35:43.380 --> 11:35:45.380
That section's different.

11:35:45.380 --> 11:35:47.380
But, like,

11:35:47.380 --> 11:35:49.380
genuinely, like, at no point

11:35:49.380 --> 11:35:51.380
where like, my mom and dad disappointed in me

11:35:51.380 --> 11:35:53.380
because I liked the game. And they like, supported it.

11:35:53.380 --> 11:35:55.380
Like, my mom

11:35:55.380 --> 11:35:57.380
she played the original Lara Croft

11:35:57.380 --> 11:35:59.380
Tomb Raider and like, my dad

11:35:59.380 --> 11:36:01.380
obviously showed me a whole

11:36:01.380 --> 11:36:03.380
insane category of games

11:36:03.380 --> 11:36:05.380
that got me used to like, all these different categories

11:36:05.380 --> 11:36:07.380
and...

11:36:07.380 --> 11:36:09.380
that kind of thing. And it's just like, really nice.

11:36:09.380 --> 11:36:11.380
Like, my dad, he absolutely

11:36:11.380 --> 11:36:13.380
loves to tell the story about how he gave me an Xbox

11:36:13.380 --> 11:36:15.380
and

11:36:15.380 --> 11:36:17.380
he'll probably tell it

11:36:17.380 --> 11:36:19.380
when I do my interview with him.

11:36:19.380 --> 11:36:21.380
And I say

11:36:21.380 --> 11:36:23.380
interview. I'm just getting my dad to talk

11:36:23.380 --> 11:36:25.380
about it.

11:36:25.380 --> 11:36:27.380
But talk about, like, how does it feel

11:36:27.380 --> 11:36:29.380
that your daughter's a slag? And then

11:36:29.380 --> 11:36:31.380
he goes, it feels pretty good

11:36:31.380 --> 11:36:33.380
because I'm going to retire

11:36:33.380 --> 11:36:35.380
and da-da-da-da-da.

11:36:35.380 --> 11:36:37.380
Um...

11:36:37.380 --> 11:36:39.380
I don't know what's going on here. Like, some people know this.

11:36:39.380 --> 11:36:41.380
Like, I managed to...

11:36:41.380 --> 11:36:43.380
Because of the banks

11:36:43.380 --> 11:36:45.380
and job issues and all that kind of thing

11:36:45.380 --> 11:36:47.380
basically, the house was going to get repossessed.

11:36:47.380 --> 11:36:49.380
Like, the family home was going to get repossessed.

11:36:49.380 --> 11:36:51.380
Because, you know, they kind of keep up

11:36:51.380 --> 11:36:53.380
with mortgage payments. So then I bought it.

11:36:53.380 --> 11:36:55.380
Like, I don't own it.

11:36:55.380 --> 11:36:57.380
Like, my parents own it. But, like, I

11:36:57.380 --> 11:36:59.380
did the difference.

11:36:59.380 --> 11:37:01.380
Um...

11:37:01.380 --> 11:37:03.380
And my dad's like...

11:37:03.380 --> 11:37:05.380
He's kind of joking when he says, like, the only reason

11:37:05.380 --> 11:37:07.380
that, like, you're

11:37:07.380 --> 11:37:09.380
like, so successful is because I got you that

11:37:09.380 --> 11:37:11.380
Xbox, isn't it? And I'm like, yeah, dad, yeah!

11:37:11.380 --> 11:37:13.380
Yeah, you made me cool, dad!

11:37:13.380 --> 11:37:15.380
Yeah! Like, we're hyping each other up.

11:37:15.380 --> 11:37:17.380
And I'm like, yeah!

11:37:17.380 --> 11:37:19.380
Um...

11:37:19.380 --> 11:37:21.380
I was, like, really cute.

11:37:21.380 --> 11:37:23.380
No, my dad's, like, such a good

11:37:23.380 --> 11:37:25.380
sport about everything.

11:37:25.380 --> 11:37:27.380
Um...

11:37:27.380 --> 11:37:29.380
Like, we're gonna do an interview.

11:37:29.380 --> 11:37:31.380
Um, and he knows

11:37:31.380 --> 11:37:33.380
about, like, Vila and that.

11:37:33.380 --> 11:37:35.380
Um, he was like, how did it go?

11:37:35.380 --> 11:37:37.380
And I was like, dad, dad!

11:37:37.380 --> 11:37:39.380
Almost 3,000 people watched

11:37:39.380 --> 11:37:41.380
me at once in one stream type thing.

11:37:41.380 --> 11:37:43.380
Um, and he's like, is that

11:37:43.380 --> 11:37:45.380
good? And I'm like, it's way beyond my

11:37:45.380 --> 11:37:47.380
world! The streams, all the girls did

11:37:47.380 --> 11:37:49.380
amazing! And he was like, oh, I'm so

11:37:49.380 --> 11:37:51.380
glad you're girls are nice to me. And my mom

11:37:51.380 --> 11:37:53.380
as well.

11:37:53.380 --> 11:37:55.380
My mom really likes the girls.

11:37:55.380 --> 11:37:57.380
Never spoken to them.

11:37:57.380 --> 11:37:59.380
They've never interacted. But my mom's

11:37:59.380 --> 11:38:01.380
like, oh, I love

11:38:01.380 --> 11:38:03.380
your girls so much. They're so...

11:38:03.380 --> 11:38:05.380
Like, send me their links. I want to hear their voices.

11:38:05.380 --> 11:38:07.380
They send me, like, all this.

11:38:07.380 --> 11:38:09.380
Like, it's so cute. It's just really nice.

11:38:09.380 --> 11:38:11.380
Um...

11:38:11.380 --> 11:38:13.380
Hopefully it doesn't feel like I'm, like,

11:38:13.380 --> 11:38:15.380
rubbing it in anyone's faces

11:38:15.380 --> 11:38:17.380
if they maybe have parents that are not

11:38:17.380 --> 11:38:19.380
quite so understanding.

11:38:19.380 --> 11:38:21.380
Uh...

11:38:21.380 --> 11:38:23.380
I really don't want it to sting

11:38:23.380 --> 11:38:25.380
if I talk about the subject, but I'll

11:38:25.380 --> 11:38:27.380
move on and we'll

11:38:27.380 --> 11:38:29.380
see what we're dealing with next. We're going to

11:38:29.380 --> 11:38:31.380
arrow storm here because

11:38:31.380 --> 11:38:33.380
we need to unlock

11:38:33.380 --> 11:38:35.380
the

11:38:35.380 --> 11:38:37.380
Assassin's Upgrade.

11:38:37.380 --> 11:38:39.380
We're, uh, right.

11:38:39.380 --> 11:38:41.380
We're trying by this building. How much time

11:38:41.380 --> 11:38:43.380
have I got? We've got, like,

11:38:43.380 --> 11:38:45.380
a cut in it quick.

11:38:45.380 --> 11:38:47.380
Meracy's not online anymore, is she?

11:38:49.380 --> 11:38:51.380
Is anyone from Ymir? Oh,

11:38:51.380 --> 11:38:53.380
I don't want to do that. Please leave me alone. I'm not doing that mission.

11:38:57.380 --> 11:38:59.380
Meracy's still on. Um, can someone

11:38:59.380 --> 11:39:01.380
be a kind soul and say

11:39:01.380 --> 11:39:03.380
Strone's asking if you're still

11:39:03.380 --> 11:39:05.380
going to be online in 20 minutes?

11:39:05.380 --> 11:39:07.380
Uh...

11:39:07.380 --> 11:39:09.380
She should redirect into you or not?

11:39:09.380 --> 11:39:11.380
Um, and then

11:39:11.380 --> 11:39:13.380
get back to me if she's still...

11:39:13.380 --> 11:39:15.380
if she's still doing it or not.

11:39:15.380 --> 11:39:17.380
We're just going to buy these expensive things now.

11:39:17.380 --> 11:39:19.380
Um...

11:39:19.380 --> 11:39:21.380
They're so... they take such a big

11:39:21.380 --> 11:39:23.380
chunk of the money, though.

11:39:23.380 --> 11:39:25.380
Literally, I'm back to 32.

11:39:25.380 --> 11:39:27.380
I think I'm going to have to send my recruits on missions

11:39:27.380 --> 11:39:29.380
again.

11:39:29.380 --> 11:39:31.380
Just came back from Shum. Ain't no way she's still going.

11:39:31.380 --> 11:39:33.380
Ah, yeah.

11:39:33.380 --> 11:39:35.380
Uh, the only reason

11:39:35.380 --> 11:39:37.380
I'm going offline in 20 minutes

11:39:37.380 --> 11:39:39.380
is because of the VOD issues.

11:39:39.380 --> 11:39:41.380
If there was no VOD issues,

11:39:41.380 --> 11:39:43.380
we would be doing Leonardo's

11:39:43.380 --> 11:39:45.380
missions right now.

11:39:45.380 --> 11:39:47.380
Right now!

11:39:47.380 --> 11:39:49.380
Right now! Uh, I'm serious when I say that.

11:39:49.380 --> 11:39:51.380
We'd be on Leonardo. We'd be in

11:39:51.380 --> 11:39:53.380
a tank right now. We'd be on a

11:39:53.380 --> 11:39:55.380
paraglider. Okay?

11:39:55.380 --> 11:39:57.380
But no.

11:39:57.380 --> 11:39:59.380
No, no, no. Had to...

11:39:59.380 --> 11:40:01.380
Had to have VOD issues.

11:40:01.380 --> 11:40:03.380
Yeah, yeah.

11:40:03.380 --> 11:40:05.380
Right, let's level up these

11:40:05.380 --> 11:40:07.380
assassinos.

11:40:07.380 --> 11:40:09.380
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

11:40:09.380 --> 11:40:11.380
We've got quite a lot

11:40:11.380 --> 11:40:13.380
of level 8s. We can probably

11:40:13.380 --> 11:40:15.380
do quite dangerous

11:40:15.380 --> 11:40:17.380
missions. I'll send...

11:40:17.380 --> 11:40:19.380
No, I won't. I'll send

11:40:19.380 --> 11:40:21.380
two 7s

11:40:21.380 --> 11:40:23.380
away together.

11:40:23.380 --> 11:40:25.380
I've got a big one. More 8s.

11:40:25.380 --> 11:40:27.380
One, two, three, four, five.

11:40:27.380 --> 11:40:29.380
Oh, you're not even fully successful now.

11:40:29.380 --> 11:40:31.380
I don't want to risk it. I'll send the 8s

11:40:31.380 --> 11:40:33.380
on...

11:40:33.380 --> 11:40:35.380
Yeah, that'll be fine.

11:40:35.380 --> 11:40:37.380
I'm literally have no worries that

11:40:37.380 --> 11:40:39.380
they're going to survive.

11:40:39.380 --> 11:40:41.380
Mm, yeah. I was kind of into

11:40:41.380 --> 11:40:43.380
that awkward levelling upstage

11:40:43.380 --> 11:40:45.380
where...

11:40:45.380 --> 11:40:47.380
I'm not wasting time sending

11:40:47.380 --> 11:40:49.380
them together, but

11:40:49.380 --> 11:40:51.380
it would be nice

11:40:51.380 --> 11:40:53.380
to get the strength to, like, go on

11:40:53.380 --> 11:40:55.380
their own.

11:40:55.380 --> 11:40:57.380
YouTube, give us YouTube take away.

11:40:57.380 --> 11:40:59.380
YouTube can stop me. Literally

11:40:59.380 --> 11:41:01.380
if I would do 14 hours,

11:41:01.380 --> 11:41:03.380
I would be doing Leonardo,

11:41:03.380 --> 11:41:05.380
and then I would be pretty

11:41:05.380 --> 11:41:07.380
satisfied. Maybe the auditory

11:41:07.380 --> 11:41:09.380
memories and Christina memory, because

11:41:09.380 --> 11:41:11.380
that's actually really quick as well.

11:41:11.380 --> 11:41:13.380
Um,

11:41:13.380 --> 11:41:15.380
I honestly would love to say

11:41:15.380 --> 11:41:17.380
I'll make a second stream room, but

11:41:17.380 --> 11:41:19.380
I do have those 8s in my collabs

11:41:19.380 --> 11:41:21.380
and those clips to get

11:41:21.380 --> 11:41:23.380
clipped and edited and that.

11:41:23.380 --> 11:41:25.380
Oh, I can't believe it. I have responsibility.

11:41:25.380 --> 11:41:27.380
Who would have imagined

11:41:27.380 --> 11:41:29.380
that spawning a VTuber agency

11:41:29.380 --> 11:41:31.380
meant I have responsibilities?

11:41:31.380 --> 11:41:33.380
Oh! Oh!

11:41:33.380 --> 11:41:35.380
Truly a shit. Please, excuse me, sir.

11:41:35.380 --> 11:41:37.380
Um...

11:41:37.380 --> 11:41:39.380
Oh, what is that? What is it?

11:41:39.380 --> 11:41:41.380
Uh, right.

11:41:41.380 --> 11:41:43.380
Um, I don't think I have enough money

11:41:43.380 --> 11:41:45.380
for, like, anything

11:41:45.380 --> 11:41:47.380
else.

11:41:47.380 --> 11:41:49.380
Wait, how much money do I have

11:41:49.380 --> 11:41:51.380
on my persons?

11:41:51.380 --> 11:41:53.380
13K, that's not enough

11:41:53.380 --> 11:41:55.380
to do anything else.

11:41:57.380 --> 11:41:59.380
We'll arrive at work any day.

11:41:59.380 --> 11:42:01.380
Can't wait for the birthday placer.

11:42:01.380 --> 11:42:03.380
Can't wait for yapping 2.0, where I

11:42:03.380 --> 11:42:05.380
regurgitate all the information. Maybe

11:42:05.380 --> 11:42:07.380
I should look at the development

11:42:07.380 --> 11:42:09.380
behind the scenes and then I can tell you about

11:42:09.380 --> 11:42:11.380
the development behind the scenes.

11:42:11.380 --> 11:42:13.380
That would be interesting too. What time are we

11:42:13.380 --> 11:42:15.380
at? I've got 20 minutes.

11:42:15.380 --> 11:42:17.380
Maybe the bank will...

11:42:17.380 --> 11:42:19.380
Hmm...

11:42:19.380 --> 11:42:21.380
Hmm...

11:42:21.380 --> 11:42:23.380
Right, let's do Christina.

11:42:23.380 --> 11:42:25.380
Let's do Christina. We've got time.

11:42:25.380 --> 11:42:27.380
It doesn't take 20 minutes to do her.

11:42:27.380 --> 11:42:29.380
Oh!

11:42:29.380 --> 11:42:31.380
That's what she said.

11:42:35.380 --> 11:42:37.380
I don't know if we'll finish

11:42:37.380 --> 11:42:39.380
her storyline. I believe she has

11:42:39.380 --> 11:42:41.380
three missions and the last

11:42:41.380 --> 11:42:43.380
mission is a punch out.

11:42:43.380 --> 11:42:45.380
Punch out?

11:42:45.380 --> 11:42:47.380
But we'll do

11:42:47.380 --> 11:42:49.380
a? Ah, Christina.

11:42:49.380 --> 11:42:51.380
Christina mission.

11:42:51.380 --> 11:42:53.380
I'm claiming

11:42:53.380 --> 11:42:55.380
the building.

11:42:55.380 --> 11:42:57.380
Claim me, claim me, claim me.

11:42:57.380 --> 11:42:59.380
Best I can do is do.

11:42:59.380 --> 11:43:01.380
Doesn't take to it.

11:43:01.380 --> 11:43:03.380
Just like,

11:43:03.380 --> 11:43:05.380
nevermind. I know, I know.

11:43:05.380 --> 11:43:07.380
I make it too easy. I don't even

11:43:07.380 --> 11:43:09.380
mean it. If I do it, I don't

11:43:09.380 --> 11:43:11.380
mean it, but if I do it to you

11:43:11.380 --> 11:43:13.380
then I mean it.

11:43:13.380 --> 11:43:15.380
Oh, look how much my armor

11:43:15.380 --> 11:43:17.380
but my health bar went up. I just

11:43:17.380 --> 11:43:19.380
like, literally noticed that.

11:43:19.380 --> 11:43:21.380
How did I not notice that?

11:43:21.380 --> 11:43:23.380
Cause it's massive.

11:43:25.380 --> 11:43:27.380
It's like halfway across. It's like

11:43:27.380 --> 11:43:29.380
the Elden Ring.

11:43:29.380 --> 11:43:31.380
Oh!

11:43:31.380 --> 11:43:33.380
Okay, we're getting stole. I see the

11:43:33.380 --> 11:43:35.380
game is trying to stall me from

11:43:35.380 --> 11:43:37.380
achieving my...

11:43:37.380 --> 11:43:39.380
Jesus, that's brutal.

11:43:39.380 --> 11:43:41.380
Oh, that's brutal.

11:43:41.380 --> 11:43:43.380
Oh, that's brutal.

11:43:43.380 --> 11:43:45.380
Is that a new knife as well?

11:43:45.380 --> 11:43:47.380
I must have unlocked a new knife

11:43:47.380 --> 11:43:49.380
cause, yeah, this must be a

11:43:49.380 --> 11:43:51.380
Romuli knife. A Romulus knife.

11:43:51.380 --> 11:43:53.380
Cause I, that does not look like

11:43:53.380 --> 11:43:55.380
the default knife.

11:43:55.380 --> 11:43:57.380
Yeah, with the hook.

11:43:57.380 --> 11:43:59.380
Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.

11:43:59.380 --> 11:44:01.380
Tihi! Tihi, I'm just

11:44:01.380 --> 11:44:03.380
the normal average citizen.

11:44:03.380 --> 11:44:05.380
Christina!

11:44:05.380 --> 11:44:07.380
My love!

11:44:07.380 --> 11:44:09.380
Hello!

11:44:13.380 --> 11:44:15.380
We'll be climbing a coast with this

11:44:15.380 --> 11:44:17.380
mission.

11:44:17.380 --> 11:44:19.380
Does it

11:44:19.380 --> 11:44:21.380
vaude explode after the 12 hour

11:44:21.380 --> 11:44:23.380
mark or is it like

11:44:23.380 --> 11:44:25.380
it gives a few minutes of grace

11:44:25.380 --> 11:44:27.380
unironically? Cause I'm worried

11:44:27.380 --> 11:44:29.380
about it exploding.

11:44:29.380 --> 11:44:31.380
Ha ha!

11:44:35.380 --> 11:44:37.380
This doesn't take long, it's a punch out.

11:44:37.380 --> 11:44:39.380
What about that one?

11:44:39.380 --> 11:44:41.380
That's my brother!

11:44:45.380 --> 11:44:47.380
This is baby, it's healing.

11:44:59.380 --> 11:45:01.380
I think it explodes right after

11:45:01.380 --> 11:45:03.380
12 hours.

11:45:05.380 --> 11:45:07.380
What?

11:45:07.380 --> 11:45:09.380
What?

11:45:09.380 --> 11:45:11.380
Why are you just standing there?

11:45:11.380 --> 11:45:13.380
Oh, um,

11:45:13.380 --> 11:45:15.380
because I

11:45:15.380 --> 11:45:17.380
wanted to ask you

11:45:17.380 --> 11:45:19.380
which is

11:45:19.380 --> 11:45:21.380
what's your name?

11:45:21.380 --> 11:45:23.380
Not one you'll ever meet me

11:45:23.380 --> 11:45:25.380
without.

11:45:25.380 --> 11:45:27.380
I wasn't ready.

11:45:27.380 --> 11:45:29.380
I'm planning on being really charming.

11:45:31.380 --> 11:45:33.380
Negative riz.

11:45:47.380 --> 11:45:49.380
Whoa!

11:45:49.380 --> 11:45:51.380
I have terrible news, please do not

11:45:51.380 --> 11:45:53.380
take the advice of Ezio.

11:45:53.380 --> 11:45:55.380
Do not ever follow a woman home.

11:45:55.380 --> 11:45:57.380
That's not

11:45:57.380 --> 11:45:59.380
socially acceptable.

11:45:59.380 --> 11:46:01.380
Don't worry, I'll teach you what's

11:46:01.380 --> 11:46:03.380
socially acceptable and what's not.

11:46:03.380 --> 11:46:05.380
If you approach a woman

11:46:05.380 --> 11:46:07.380
and then

11:46:07.380 --> 11:46:09.380
she, you know,

11:46:09.380 --> 11:46:11.380
doesn't reciprocate interest,

11:46:11.380 --> 11:46:13.380
do not follow

11:46:13.380 --> 11:46:15.380
a woman home. That is no-no

11:46:15.380 --> 11:46:17.380
in society.

11:46:17.380 --> 11:46:19.380
More societal,

11:46:19.380 --> 11:46:21.380
social...

11:46:21.380 --> 11:46:23.380
Oh! See?

11:46:25.380 --> 11:46:27.380
Wait, get back here.

11:46:27.380 --> 11:46:29.380
Oh my god, she wants me for real, for real.

11:46:29.380 --> 11:46:31.380
That's how you get a restraining order.

11:46:31.380 --> 11:46:33.380
Yeah, this is...

11:46:33.380 --> 11:46:35.380
I understand it's a video game,

11:46:35.380 --> 11:46:37.380
but

11:46:37.380 --> 11:46:39.380
this is...

11:46:39.380 --> 11:46:41.380
Yeah.

11:46:43.380 --> 11:46:45.380
Yeah, this is...

11:46:47.380 --> 11:46:49.380
Yeah, this is...

11:46:51.380 --> 11:46:53.380
something alright.

11:46:55.380 --> 11:46:57.380
Like,

11:46:57.380 --> 11:46:59.380
I know Ezio's harmless,

11:46:59.380 --> 11:47:01.380
but this is... it's given, like,

11:47:01.380 --> 11:47:03.380
yandere simulator or something.

11:47:05.380 --> 11:47:07.380
Like, that kind of negative thing.

11:47:09.380 --> 11:47:11.380
Restraining order speed run for real.

11:47:13.380 --> 11:47:15.380
The best thing you think of to get around 12-hour

11:47:15.380 --> 11:47:17.380
problem is to close the stream when you...

11:47:17.380 --> 11:47:19.380
Oh, I wasn't paying attention, sorry, I was reading chat.

11:47:19.380 --> 11:47:21.380
12-hour problem is

11:47:21.380 --> 11:47:23.380
to close...

11:47:23.380 --> 11:47:25.380
to close

11:47:25.380 --> 11:47:27.380
the stream when you have to take a long

11:47:27.380 --> 11:47:29.380
break and start a new one after.

11:47:29.380 --> 11:47:31.380
Okay.

11:47:31.380 --> 11:47:33.380
Do you mean, like, actually go offline and rest

11:47:33.380 --> 11:47:35.380
and then come back online again? Is that your solution

11:47:35.380 --> 11:47:37.380
to my 12-hour stream problem?

11:47:39.380 --> 11:47:41.380
Instruction's unclear, I'm hiding in her closet.

11:47:41.380 --> 11:47:43.380
Oh!

11:47:43.380 --> 11:47:45.380
That's terrible!

11:47:45.380 --> 11:47:47.380
You're not to make those jokes!

11:47:47.380 --> 11:47:49.380
That's naughty!

11:47:49.380 --> 11:47:51.380
Oh.

11:47:51.380 --> 11:47:53.380
Okay, this quest has taken

11:47:53.380 --> 11:47:55.380
a bit longer than I originally anticipated.

11:47:59.380 --> 11:48:01.380
But I think we're about to do the fighting

11:48:01.380 --> 11:48:03.380
part and then we're done.

11:48:03.380 --> 11:48:05.380
You achieved 100%

11:48:05.380 --> 11:48:07.380
in problem

11:48:07.380 --> 11:48:09.380
solving.

11:48:09.380 --> 11:48:11.380
Okay, we're here, we're here, we end this.

11:48:13.380 --> 11:48:15.380
We hate him!

11:48:21.380 --> 11:48:23.380
I think not, I'm already here.

11:48:23.380 --> 11:48:25.380
I've decided, I'm tired

11:48:25.380 --> 11:48:27.380
of waiting for you to open your legs

11:48:27.380 --> 11:48:29.380
on your own.

11:48:37.380 --> 11:48:39.380
Oh, the area, I thought his name was Duccio

11:48:39.380 --> 11:48:41.380
for some reason.

11:48:41.380 --> 11:48:43.380
Oh my god, we're the knight in

11:48:43.380 --> 11:48:45.380
training armor, we're not creepy anymore

11:48:45.380 --> 11:48:47.380
because we're saving her.

11:48:47.380 --> 11:48:49.380
Take this!

11:48:49.380 --> 11:48:51.380
Leave the lady alone!

11:48:59.380 --> 11:49:01.380
Thank you.

11:49:01.380 --> 11:49:03.380
That was very kind of you.

11:49:03.380 --> 11:49:05.380
Are you alright?

11:49:05.380 --> 11:49:07.380
Not only is her...

11:49:07.380 --> 11:49:09.380
I'm sorry.

11:49:15.380 --> 11:49:17.380
He looks like such a baby there, honestly.

11:49:17.380 --> 11:49:19.380
Looks like you got yourself a second chance.

11:49:23.380 --> 11:49:25.380
If she kisses and not even

11:49:25.380 --> 11:49:27.380
on the first date,

11:49:27.380 --> 11:49:29.380
we're in, lads.

11:49:29.380 --> 11:49:31.380
We're in, lads.

11:49:31.380 --> 11:49:33.380
We are in.

11:49:35.380 --> 11:49:37.380
You stalking wha- No!

11:49:37.380 --> 11:49:39.380
No!

11:49:39.380 --> 11:49:41.380
Absolutely not!

11:49:43.380 --> 11:49:45.380
Absolutely not!

11:49:45.380 --> 11:49:47.380
This is fictional game.

11:49:47.380 --> 11:49:49.380
Literally when you build up the game,

11:49:49.380 --> 11:49:51.380
it says fiction.

11:49:51.380 --> 11:49:53.380
Okay, I think

11:49:53.380 --> 11:49:55.380
I'm gonna have to close the game there

11:49:55.380 --> 11:49:57.380
because the void

11:49:57.380 --> 11:49:59.380
is literally about to explode.

11:49:59.380 --> 11:50:01.380
Did you guys tell me if

11:50:01.380 --> 11:50:03.380
Mercy is still strumming?

11:50:03.380 --> 11:50:05.380
They'll be strumming her in a minute.

11:50:05.380 --> 11:50:07.380
Stop!

11:50:07.380 --> 11:50:09.380
Stop.

11:50:09.380 --> 11:50:11.380
Unappropriate.

11:50:11.380 --> 11:50:13.380
No HR though.

11:50:13.380 --> 11:50:15.380
Mercy is still on.

11:50:15.380 --> 11:50:17.380
She's still gonna keep playing.

11:50:17.380 --> 11:50:19.380
She's still gonna...

11:50:19.380 --> 11:50:21.380
Remember that time donations were on?

11:50:21.380 --> 11:50:23.380
And then you guys broke the donations so badly

11:50:23.380 --> 11:50:25.380
that no one in Vehler can get donated to right now?

11:50:25.380 --> 11:50:27.380
Because you guys were so supportive.

11:50:27.380 --> 11:50:29.380
Yeah, she's still yapping.

11:50:29.380 --> 11:50:31.380
She's post-game yapping.

11:50:31.380 --> 11:50:33.380
Alright, well...

11:50:35.380 --> 11:50:37.380
I'm gonna get her link.

11:50:37.380 --> 11:50:39.380
Mercy, can I get your link?

11:50:39.380 --> 11:50:41.380
Mercy, can I get your link?

11:50:41.380 --> 11:50:43.380
Mercy, can I get your link?

11:50:43.380 --> 11:50:45.380
That's how I spell Mercy Modest.

11:50:45.380 --> 11:50:47.380
That's right.

11:50:47.380 --> 11:50:49.380
What are you gonna do about it?

11:50:49.380 --> 11:50:51.380
Are you gonna fart?

11:50:51.380 --> 11:50:53.380
Yeah, that's right.

11:50:53.380 --> 11:50:55.380
You're not gonna fart.

11:50:55.380 --> 11:50:57.380
You're gonna do nothing about it.

11:50:57.380 --> 11:50:59.380
Come on.

11:50:59.380 --> 11:51:01.380
Stop it!

11:51:01.380 --> 11:51:03.380
Analytics? No, wrong one.

11:51:03.380 --> 11:51:05.380
Details. Customization.

11:51:05.380 --> 11:51:07.380
Redirect.

11:51:07.380 --> 11:51:09.380
I'm gonna link right in there.

11:51:09.380 --> 11:51:11.380
Save.

11:51:11.380 --> 11:51:13.380
Okay, when I end, it should redirect

11:51:13.380 --> 11:51:15.380
into...

11:51:15.380 --> 11:51:17.380
this encyclopedia

11:51:17.380 --> 11:51:19.380
of Would You Want to Quit the Game?

11:51:19.380 --> 11:51:21.380
Righty-hoo!

11:51:21.380 --> 11:51:23.380
Should I go bigger?

11:51:25.380 --> 11:51:27.380
Hold on a minute.

11:51:29.380 --> 11:51:31.380
Why is chat wrong?

11:51:31.380 --> 11:51:33.380
Chat isn't disabled!

11:51:37.380 --> 11:51:39.380
Well...

11:51:39.380 --> 11:51:41.380
What is this?

11:51:41.380 --> 11:51:43.380
Why the heck?

11:51:43.380 --> 11:51:45.380
You know what?

11:51:45.380 --> 11:51:47.380
I'll just stand here then.

11:51:47.380 --> 11:51:49.380
Hi!

11:51:49.380 --> 11:51:51.380
I say hi

11:51:51.380 --> 11:51:53.380
if we're not all about to go a bit.

11:51:53.380 --> 11:51:55.380
Thank you all so much

11:51:55.380 --> 11:51:57.380
for letting me go

11:51:57.380 --> 11:51:59.380
turbo mode on this game.

11:51:59.380 --> 11:52:01.380
It has been nothing short of a pleasure

11:52:01.380 --> 11:52:03.380
and I hope

11:52:03.380 --> 11:52:05.380
we can 100%

11:52:05.380 --> 11:52:07.380
tomorrow.

11:52:07.380 --> 11:52:09.380
I don't know what the tank mission is.

11:52:09.380 --> 11:52:11.380
I don't know if I should look it up

11:52:11.380 --> 11:52:13.380
or if I should just

11:52:13.380 --> 11:52:15.380
wish myself good luck on the tank.

11:52:15.380 --> 11:52:17.380
But yes.

11:52:17.380 --> 11:52:19.380
Thank you for hanging.

11:52:19.380 --> 11:52:21.380
Please don't worry if you weren't here for the full thing.

11:52:21.380 --> 11:52:23.380
I don't think anyone was here for the full thing

11:52:23.380 --> 11:52:25.380
other than me.

11:52:25.380 --> 11:52:27.380
Please.

11:52:27.380 --> 11:52:29.380
I miss her already!

11:52:29.380 --> 11:52:31.380
I'm still talking!

11:52:31.380 --> 11:52:33.380
Have I even gone yet?

11:52:33.380 --> 11:52:35.380
We are 52 minutes

11:52:35.380 --> 11:52:37.380
so less than 7 minutes.

11:52:37.380 --> 11:52:39.380
I'm stinky.

11:52:39.380 --> 11:52:41.380
I'm going to end it

11:52:41.380 --> 11:52:43.380
so it can successfully raid into Mercy.

11:52:43.380 --> 11:52:45.380
But thank you so much

11:52:45.380 --> 11:52:47.380
for keeping me company.

11:52:47.380 --> 11:52:49.380
I'm so glad I got to share one of the...

11:52:49.380 --> 11:52:51.380
one of the? No.

11:52:51.380 --> 11:52:53.380
The greatest game

11:52:53.380 --> 11:52:55.380
of all time.

11:52:55.380 --> 11:52:57.380
I have no idea how long tomorrow

11:52:57.380 --> 11:52:59.380
the stream is going to be.

11:52:59.380 --> 11:53:01.380
But really

11:53:01.380 --> 11:53:03.380
we pretty much done everything other than

11:53:03.380 --> 11:53:05.380
Leonardo missions and then we just go back

11:53:05.380 --> 11:53:07.380
in the DNA sequences

11:53:07.380 --> 11:53:09.380
of the chapters we messed up

11:53:09.380 --> 11:53:11.380
and by we messed up I messed up

11:53:11.380 --> 11:53:13.380
but I'm putting the blame on the both of us.

11:53:13.380 --> 11:53:15.380
Okay?

11:53:15.380 --> 11:53:17.380
Um...

11:53:17.380 --> 11:53:19.380
Can you give us a peek at those eyes before you hop off

11:53:19.380 --> 11:53:21.380
as encouragement for showing up?

11:53:21.380 --> 11:53:23.380
Oh go go go! I like it.

11:53:23.380 --> 11:53:25.380
I dig it. Ah, new subscriber

11:53:25.380 --> 11:53:27.380
you're in the way.

11:53:27.380 --> 11:53:29.380
You're such a silly goober up there, new subscriber.

11:53:29.380 --> 11:53:31.380
How do I get rid of you?

11:53:31.380 --> 11:53:33.380
Just for now.

11:53:33.380 --> 11:53:35.380
Okay.

11:53:35.380 --> 11:53:37.380
You ready?

11:53:37.380 --> 11:53:39.380
Even though my Assassin's Creed sounds are still

11:53:39.380 --> 11:53:41.380
in the background? Just pretend the backing

11:53:41.380 --> 11:53:43.380
track to the menu of Assassin's Creed

11:53:43.380 --> 11:53:45.380
is Hypnosis space, okay?

11:53:45.380 --> 11:53:47.380
Wow.

11:53:47.380 --> 11:53:49.380
You want to come to stream tomorrow, don't you?

11:53:51.380 --> 11:53:53.380
I'll be waiting.

11:53:53.380 --> 11:53:55.380
And you've done very well today.

11:53:55.380 --> 11:53:57.380
Holding on for

11:53:57.380 --> 11:53:59.380
too long.

11:53:59.380 --> 11:54:01.380
Can you do it again

11:54:01.380 --> 11:54:03.380
tomorrow for me?

11:54:03.380 --> 11:54:05.380
Yeah?

11:54:05.380 --> 11:54:07.380
Fine then.

11:54:07.380 --> 11:54:09.380
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:54:09.380 --> 11:54:11.380
Nya!

11:54:11.380 --> 11:54:13.380
But for now

11:54:13.380 --> 11:54:15.380
you can meme in me, okay?

11:54:15.380 --> 11:54:17.380
You can meme in me.

11:54:17.380 --> 11:54:19.380
Okay.

11:54:19.380 --> 11:54:21.380
Thank you so so much.

11:54:21.380 --> 11:54:23.380
We're gonna go to Mercy.

11:54:23.380 --> 11:54:25.380
Should have picked

11:54:25.380 --> 11:54:27.380
any kind of support.

11:54:27.380 --> 11:54:29.380
Right. I love you so so much, Reflings.

11:54:29.380 --> 11:54:31.380
And if you're not Reflinging

11:54:31.380 --> 11:54:33.380
don't worry, I still love you too

11:54:33.380 --> 11:54:35.380
because I'm really appreciate you hanging out.

11:54:35.380 --> 11:54:37.380
I know some people don't like being referred to

11:54:37.380 --> 11:54:39.380
as Fannins, but I like Reflings.

11:54:39.380 --> 11:54:41.380
No.

11:54:41.380 --> 11:54:43.380
Not that.

11:54:43.380 --> 11:54:45.380
Reflings.

11:54:49.380 --> 11:54:51.380
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:54:51.380 --> 11:54:53.380
Bye bye. I go sleep and brush my teeth.

11:54:53.380 --> 11:54:55.380
No, I brush my teeth first and then I go sleep.

11:54:55.380 --> 11:54:57.380
But first,

11:54:57.380 --> 11:54:59.380
Mercy.

11:54:59.380 --> 11:55:01.380
I'll then brush teeth.
