1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
my little reflex I added a denoiser filter but I don't know if that made this stream worse

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
hi reflex

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:43,000
mommy's right here she just had to wake up late because I was I was being a mommy and I was having to do a lot of work

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
strong is life to buy some any need

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
hello hello my little reflex

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
sh sh sh sh it's okay

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
mommy's here

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
sh sh sh hello little baby

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've put a little, um, a noise gate on the microphone, so hopefully the background noise isn't like the weight noise isn't too bad.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I, um, they don't cope well without you know, I don't cope well without my reflex.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I had to do some business last night, and there may or may not be a collab with another agency planned.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Um, do I spoil it? Do you want me to spoil the surprise? Because only, you only know what the surprise is if you're in this chat right now.

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Also, please do check emotes for those of you who are on the emotes here.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was able to add all 10 of my emotes, and I get to order 10 more, and I'm so excited to order the next batch of 10 emotes.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Um, I already have a few ideas, but yes, please.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will try to be as relaxed as I can, but the problem is, I get so excited talking to you.

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That basically, the ASMR goes out the window all the time, which is, there we go.

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, there's your warning.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Uh, we are not doing hypnosis, uh, unfortunately.

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you very much, Nate Sterling, for becoming a free-fling member, dear.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Real dear. God, I need to change the name of that. It's like, so big.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Long-toe-mo-win. Ah, you leave my long-toes out of them, disclaimer's single.

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But I'm going to try and be relaxing. Thank you, Jay, for becoming a member.

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Thank you, Ken, Gwispy, for becoming a member.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I know I've got my hypnosis background.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I was originally going, ah, Brian.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Can you guys hear Brian?

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ah, Pachinka, thank you for the 5 gifted, hold on, let me get a stream of elements, oh.

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Anonymous, thank you for the tip.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wait. Anonymous is ice-tronning, hopefully your day is amazing.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's just gone started, and since I can't just start with my reef links, it's going great.

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Brian is very quiet, yes.

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I didn't, I knew ASMR, so I turned Brian down, like, right away.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can maybe foam up a little bit, but...

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I have a quick question, how did you learn hypnosis?

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I just observe. I want to get into it, but it's kind of intimidating.

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Literally, I just observe. I absolutely love going, like, deep into things I don't know about,

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and I've always had an interest in it, so I like to consume people's production, or whatever.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Zarian, ah, thank you for the 100.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Congrats on monetization years for some of that most, bro.

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Zarian, that's a lot. Thank you.

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh my god.

43
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
100 dollar tip, that's crazy.

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
100 centimeters, nah, that's not possible.

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But Pachinka, thank you for the 5 gifted.

46
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But yeah, I just really like challenging myself.

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I always have a fascination in trying to understand why people like certain things.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I know that seems silly, but I do.

49
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just enjoy it, like, as much as I might tease the prep bros or something like that.

50
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I just find it fascinating, I honestly do.

51
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Like, what makes you, you know, what tickles your pickle is a challenge to me, and I accept it wholeheartedly.

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But yeah, Secret Subject is an excellent feature, but Secret Subject is such a sweet heart.

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:14,000
She so willingly educates the masses about it, and like, I love that she doesn't like cakey bit or anything.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But like, everything that I do right now, or produce, is because of observations I've made.

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mangope, thank you.

56
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She's learning from spells and empathizing.

57
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It reminds me of someone.

58
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, Secret is fantastic.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
She's got a new feature, Bermuda, which is like a polygon design, like the older video games.

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I was tempted to get one for myself when I'm playing Nintendo DS games, because the graphics,

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
we're going to be playing a game called Dragon Quest Senators of the Stars, guys.

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And obviously the graphics are Nintendo graphics, but I thought it would be cool if that model would match,

63
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
but I'd rather save the money and get it for the girls.

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Like, I have very bad news for Shibi and Insura investors.

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They will be getting a toggle that covers them up.

66
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Me and Mercy did not upset...

67
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Congrats to those who got the memberships with their face.

68
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Me and Mercy's chests don't upset YouTube.

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Insura and Shibi's chests has upset YouTube.

70
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you notice that A.C.'s trailer video has 30,000 views, that's because advertisement money was put into it.

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Everyone had the same amount of advertisement money, except me.

72
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've never put the same amount on myself.

73
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I actually don't think I've spent any on myself.

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But Insura and Shibi were denied at running predominantly due to their chests.

75
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Insura's ASMR short was denied, even though she's not doing a single thing wrong in it.

76
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So sadly, at the moment, the girls are being very creative and doing a little thing.

77
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes, I will say to the girls, they are welcome to use their toggles when they think the situation calls for it.

78
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's perfectly fine by me.

79
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, even the shorts, the girls weren't allowed.

80
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now that they're monetized, today, Mercy is doing her celebration, I believe.

81
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So please do let her entertain you.

82
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm probably going to be lurking her monetization.

83
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Our thing is live.

84
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
AC is on Saturday.

85
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Emmy, I don't know when Emmy wants to do it.

86
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I mean, you know what? I'm going to DM her right now.

87
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:59,000
A-M-E-A-M-R-S just wanted to know when you plan, when you plan on doing your S-L-A-B-R-E-S-E on stream.

88
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Just so I know when to remember S-L-A-B-R-S-E live.

89
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And then I'll do a little, and before she's in the channel, and then I'll do a little head-butt.

90
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Need a Mercedes.

91
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
She's so going to know how to type that live, there's no way.

92
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh no, she's on mobile. She's on her phone, she can see.

93
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh my god, the key clicking was in my head when my headphones, sorry.

94
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Emmy was watching AC, okay.

95
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes, Azura and Shibi, it is not lost on me that Azura and Shibi are waiting for monetization, and they both just happened to have the biggest boobs.

96
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Feature for manager ASMR.

97
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's, I do like the boring stuff, like the kind of monotonous stuff where it's like, oh you need to open up membership to your type thing, and you need to do this and that.

98
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Like, I try not to let the girls do that, because it's both stressful and it's both like, it takes time, and rather the girls focus on having fun at debut and all.

99
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And then they're, well they're second week now.

100
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Not bad, I wasn't expecting it to sound so real. That's cause they're for ya.

101
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But they will get monetization nonetheless, right?

102
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, we're waiting on it.

103
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I think the AI detection is flagged to them, basically.

104
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So a human does need to review them, which takes longer.

105
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's just pray that we have like a weep that understands what an earth featuring is, cause if they get denied, I'm gonna be so...

106
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm gonna be raging, I'm not even gonna lie.

107
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't think there's gonna be issues, I think the AI has just sent them on to...

108
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And... yeah.

109
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Someone says you own your own tag at Realtary For now, let's go!

110
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Weeps and YouTube headquarters, yeah.

111
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They better...

112
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Did you like my ASMR yesterday? Oh my god, I was outrageous.

113
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't believe I even did that.

114
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I got my tools out, I bet you liked that, didn't ya?

115
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was juicy.

116
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I was pretty gay, great, but can you feel your teeth?

117
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What, cause I liked it so much.

118
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
One of your friends had a Q&A, I wanted to send a message, but I was too scared to send one.

119
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hi Anna.

120
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Do they not see who sent them or do they see if you send a message in front of them?

121
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Thank you for the tip, Anna.

122
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't know if you heard that, cause Brian is so nice and quiet.

123
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Are marshmallow messages anonymous? Yes, that is why they are favoured by many.

124
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
One of my gen mates had a Q&A and you wanted to ask a question, but you were scared to send one.

125
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do they see you send some or you know we do not see a single thing?

126
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Information-wise, it's just a question.

127
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can send them if you want, but... yeah.

128
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Do they not see you send them or do they see if you send the message in the past? No.

129
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I can vouch right now and say no, I cannot tell.

130
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Someone could send me three questions in a row and change their spelling.

131
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And I wouldn't know, so I'm looking confident here.

132
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Hi Brian in the far distance.

133
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I left work early to watch you, but guys, I hope you're okay and you feel better soon.

134
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I like the measuring section. Now everyone knows I have long toes, what you can do about it.

135
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But yes, please, so can you tell, based on spelling.

136
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Well, you don't have to worry about me when it comes to spelling.

137
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There's absolutely no way I can clock you other than if you send a...

138
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I recognise that girl.

139
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Sitting on your feet again.

140
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm Gollum sitting right now, so my feet are in front of me and pushed into the chair.

141
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
She's learning the pattern. No, I cannot do that.

142
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I do, I'll let the girl talk about it, but there's one girl, a vealer, that does recognise text.

143
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Monka Ace, I don't know how her brain does it, but yeah.

144
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We were close to having a cats and ace workshop.

145
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You've got to see Kim Lee.

146
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And then I go, that's where we learned Kim Lee.

147
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
How's your daughter?

148
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, I'm going to get a doctor's appointment, something's not right.

149
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Someone was like, you need to sue, and I was like, nah, it's just what happens.

150
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's kind of a risk you accept, because it's a job shop.

151
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You can get like, sorry, I need to scratch my head, my head says sin, or my headset and then...

152
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's just the thing.

153
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Watching you during my collab lecture.

154
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm in your ears.

155
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Look left, look right, I might be in the lecture audience right now.

156
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I know that's not how it works, but get educated, get educated.

157
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Please do go to the doctor.

158
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, don't worry, I am.

159
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Someone sent me a marshmallow, and I was like, okay, you've convinced me, so don't worry, I've got a doctor's appointment coming up.

160
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Someone says, very nice celebration.

161
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Sorry, I'm reading marshmallows.

162
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm so, so sleepy, wifling.

163
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I was up solely, I've only had five hours sleep.

164
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm probably going to go back to sleep, but yeah.

165
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I was planning all these fun things, and making a lot of progress.

166
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
My ASMR series is about to start up.

167
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
My thank you for eggs subscriber series is about to start, and I have no idea what to edit first.

168
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
My first thing was going to be ear licking, but that's not allowed anymore.

169
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And I did a pop rock ear licking, and that's not going to be allowed.

170
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So, I have no idea.

171
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I do have burping ASMR, I may make that.

172
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I have like thigh cupping, I have like sitting on the mic ASMR, like I sit on it over and over again.

173
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You're almost at 5K up here or not, you guys are showing too much support.

174
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank you Lord of Stars for becoming a member.

175
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But yeah, I do have like sitting on the mic ASMR, I was squatting so hard.

176
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I have like clapping without using my hands ASMR, so that's going to be interesting.

177
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But I'll probably edit all that stuff, you heard her hit 5K right now.

178
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Stop being so amazing and perfect then.

179
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Too much support, literally, but like, don't be, get subscribed, get subscribed, get subscribed.

180
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So many ASMRs, yes, I have a long day to think of it.

181
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Clapping without using your hands, oh yeah.

182
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But Jane, thank you for the day.

183
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
No matter what you do for ASMR, I will enjoy you, even the burp ASMR.

184
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I took a bottle of water, a bottle of water, and a can of cola in the ASMR booth.

185
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm basically chocked in to produce burps for burping ear to ear ASMR.

186
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I think it will be like 14 minutes long.

187
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I need to order the artwork of me being pregnant with you because I want to make that ASMR.

188
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I want to make it really good, I want to put all my love into it, especially the burp ASMR.

189
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Suffering from success.

190
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's funny how you're giving the people what they need and what they want, yeah.

191
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I made a joke and it was like the average featureber would do it behind all paywall me.

192
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I come out swinging doing it week one, what are you going to do about it?

193
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Huh?

194
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What are you going to do about it?

195
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That baby, literally me, the father, literally me.

196
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Hello?

197
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The what?

198
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's right.

199
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm making an ASMR where I'm pregnant with you and you're the father.

200
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And there's nothing you can do about it.

201
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You had my curio saved but now you have my ditch.

202
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You can't stop the cut-offs.

203
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No you can't.

204
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh forget, I have my supposed to read that name.

205
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I have my supposed to say your name.

206
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Wait, thank you for becoming a member.

207
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Let's go on Google Translate real quick.

208
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Google Translate.

209
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's go.

210
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What's the translation?

211
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Apparently the translation is vacuum.

212
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Thank you vacuum for becoming a member.

213
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Maybe Joby Stroni ASMR.

214
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh yeah, no 100%.

215
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm going to do like a girlfriend forgets to mute her mic while she's eating.

216
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So obviously it's only for people who like eating sounds because I inhale my food.

217
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So I'm going to order like KFC and then basically just head recording.

218
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
There we go.

219
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
God bless this woman.

220
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Also the baby and the father.

221
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Literally me.

222
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Average VTuber asking for 10 bucks to save me.

223
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I mean, Milt Stroni put them grippers on the table from the start.

224
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Hey, I will even value for money, okay?

225
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Little Slurping ASMR.

226
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

227
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Someone says Kuhaku.

228
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Kuhaku Google Translate means real cool.

229
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Kuhaku, thank you for the membership.

230
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hold on, I can't even see if I'm picking the audio or not.

231
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I watched some VTuber data here.

232
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Well, ASMR is helping me to sleep.

233
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm glad.

234
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We're having a very relaxed ASMR.

235
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
A.C.

236
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
My gen mate, you can click the link in the description.

237
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
She has been killing it with ASMR recently.

238
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
She's been doing so good.

239
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So if you like live ASMR, that's extra cuddly and a little bit sus.

240
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Please do check your A.C. Snowballs in the description below.

241
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
My little reef links.

242
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Thank you all so much for the support you've been showing the girls.

243
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It just is so much.

244
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It means so much that you even give them a chance.

245
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Everyone has their favorite little feeler girl.

246
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Or some of you can't even decide, which is so adorable.

247
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's just been...

248
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Wait, did I say thank you, bitch?

249
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I can't go for the super chat.

250
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Thank you.

251
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm so sorry if I didn't.

252
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I got stream elements open so I can see anything I miss.

253
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But yeah, thank you.

254
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He did admit it, I can't say.

255
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Spicy hot slurping ASMR.

256
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So I follow in real life ASMRists.

257
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And they also got it with a warning for ear licking.

258
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So yeah, my theory that YouTube has done a stales policy update

259
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
is getting stronger and stronger by the second.

260
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
In real life channels are now getting hit as well.

261
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So, oh, I just cracked my freaking wrist if you heard that.

262
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That was so loud.

263
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Hello, thank you for joining me.

264
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

265
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Hypnotize the drill ASMR or I'd like to make that a little bit cute.

266
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I came for you but they all seem great.

267
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
They are so fantastic and they're each in an individual way.

268
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Like, I'm so glad that one girl can like speak to you.

269
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's get the tinfoil hats since you're true candy when you're licking.

270
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah, I think I'll just get them out by Twitter premium.

271
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So I get Brian, ReluctantlySaint, thank you for the tip.

272
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
ReluctantlySaint says the towers are so wonderfully amazing.

273
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's hard not to love them all.

274
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's literally impossible.

275
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But yes, I think I will buy Twitter premium.

276
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And I'll just upload those ear licking videos that I recorded.

277
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And I'll also put them on Patreon just like for storage so you can listen at any time, okay?

278
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Because it seems a shame to like waste those recorded sessions.

279
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
For Twitter premium, let's make upload like full videos.

280
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So I'll just put it on like for free and all that.

281
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Give it a lot of money.

282
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Look, I don't have a chance I got to defeat you for a shuffle, okay?

283
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You just crack it down and ruin it forever. You're ruining it.

284
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Do you guys want me to put you in between my thighs?

285
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That's your in between my thighs right now.

286
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Okay, do you like it? Do you want to be in between my thighs forever?

287
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Oh, sorry, I'm picking the mic.

288
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay, you just stay in between my thighs.

289
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
That 3G, oh, literally, I got you in a headlock.

290
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
There's nothing we can do about it.

291
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We're a watermelon, honestly.

292
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Bansley.

293
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yes, we can link Bansley on YouTube, that's not allowed.

294
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Please crush my school.

295
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I feel like all the platforms are going over the top filtering.

296
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes, I agree, it's getting ridiculous.

297
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
My enjoyers are being fed.

298
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Could you imagine?

299
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
How good you are at ASMR sounds from my cardboard?

300
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Don't be a stop-at, don't be a troll, box enthusiast.

301
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Thank you for the neat tip.

302
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't be so silly.

303
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You're just trying to upset me, Mr. Cardboard Box, aren't you?

304
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Well, the funny thing is, Twitter just announced that they officially acknowledged and accept that kind of content.

305
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And I was like, wait a minute, but this is good for us, this is based.

306
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But yes, you can't stop the reeflings, I can know.

307
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Watermelons in your neighborhood, now you're reeflings.

308
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You'll always be my reeflings.

309
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I had to wait an entire year to call you reeflings, okay?

310
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm actually going to make, I think I may have said this, I can't remember if I have or not.

311
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I am going to make a reprogramming hypnosis ASMR where I get you to forget your name and make you respond to reefling.

312
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And it's going to be a subconscious plant.

313
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So it will always be effective unless, sorry, that was my hot water bottle if you heard it.

314
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Unless you listen to my audio that reverses any permanent effects, it's going to be my permanent effect.

315
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
First audio is you are reefling, you will respond to reefling, and you are mine and owned by me.

316
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But I am a merciful streamer and you're more than welcome to be part of other communities,

317
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
such as Snippets and HeroM and all that, I don't have a problem.

318
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The reprogramming, yes, I do have a reprogramming audio, it will be available very shortly.

319
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The funny thing is, I'm going to upload it before I even upload any permanent effect hypnosis.

320
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Just to be super super safe and everyone knows where to crop it.

321
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Don't need hypnosis for that, I already forgot my name, I don't need, I can reprogram, can reprogram, can reprogram.

322
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, shh, shh, can reprogram.

323
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,500
Good to know we'll have it from the start.

324
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,500
I already responded to Riefling, did ya?

325
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I think that's so adorable.

326
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,500
You're such a good Riefling, aren't ya?

327
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,500
So well-behaved for me.

328
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,500
I love that you're a good boy for me.

329
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,500
And I love that we can tease each other

330
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,500
and just have a really good day.

331
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Yeah, I'm my kid mommy.

332
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Oh, no, mommy. I said mommy.

333
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
I read mommy in the chat.

334
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,500
This is why I can't read into ASMR the same day.

335
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Thank you, sir. Okay.

336
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Thank you for the consideration.

337
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:59,500
Oh, yeah, no, I'm educated enough to know a permanent effect.

338
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Hypnosis, I don't. I think it's very dangerous too.

339
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Pachinga, thank you for the 10.

340
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Super chat, we accept our stinky overlord.

341
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,500
It's not in my budget to support both on-paperture

342
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
and membership.

343
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
What do you recommend?

344
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Please note, I always have free content always coming out as well

345
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
on my alternative to whatever I do have plans.

346
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Please don't worry.

347
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,500
There'll always be free streams and free audios of that variety.

348
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,500
If you prefer a live stream experience,

349
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:43,500
then YouTube membership, if you prefer a audio,

350
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:51,500
edited audio experience, where the ending you are supposed to ink.

351
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Definitely check out my Patreon.

352
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:02,500
The link is in the description.

353
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Oh, I just went sniffing ASMR.

354
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Oh, a replay.

355
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Oh, I know, sniffing is limited ads.

356
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Oh, I'm so sorry, sniffing is limited ads.

357
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,500
I completely forgot.

358
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:30,500
I don't know why, but sniffing ASMR is also considered like gratifying content.

359
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,500
So I can't really do sniffing.

360
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Yeah, I don't know what is going on at YouTube headquarters,

361
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,500
but something funky and sus is going on.

362
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,500
I don't know of all things.

363
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,500
I know, I honestly, I don't understand.

364
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
There's a hidden policy update going on.

365
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
They've not announced it.

366
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
I think the reason they're not announced it

367
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,500
is because so many people enjoy ASMR.

368
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Zenbros, yeah, I don't know why.

369
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,500
All of A.C.'s streams are limited ads.

370
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
I don't know what she's getting up to in her streams.

371
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,500
But it's definitely not looking good.

372
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Now, YouTube have reverted policies before,

373
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,500
so I'm going to hope that they do.

374
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
AceDia.

375
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Oh my God, I can't say that name.

376
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,500
There's too many vowels in your name.

377
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,500
AceDia.

378
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Thank you for the membership.

379
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
That's not why you say that.

380
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
AceDia.

381
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
I am so sorry.

382
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,500
I'm absolutely picturing your name.

383
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,500
At the street, YouTube will be only ASMR.

384
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Ace does not stay safe.

385
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Oh, okay, well, alright.

386
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,500
I mean, I can't do a few things here and there.

387
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,500
As long as no one says a thing.

388
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
I'm a girl.

389
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
I know I'm not the main demographic by La Vie La.

390
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Oh, I'm so glad you're going to enjoy it.

391
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
We are...

392
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,500
It's like, I'm not going to lie and say that, you know,

393
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,500
guys pay my bills, so I'll appeal to you guys.

394
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,500
But I'm glad you're going to enjoy the alert for what it's worth.

395
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
My lips are sealed.

396
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,500
If your lips are sealed, then maybe,

397
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,500
just maybe we can get up to a few shenanigans,

398
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,500
because reflex when we shenan once,

399
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,500
you know we're going to shenan again.

400
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Ace's YouTube streams are very...

401
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Okay, I'll take your word for it, Evelyn.

402
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Yeah, snitches get stitches.

403
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Don't think I won't send any on you.

404
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Do you think that book is just for resurrection spells?

405
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
That book, oh dear.

406
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,500
That book is nothing but trouble.

407
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,500
The things that Emmy can do to you is staggering.

408
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,500
I'll say Emmy on you, okay?

409
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Lips are completely sealed.

410
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Good.

411
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
You're going to shenan again.

412
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Yeah.

413
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Wait, can you really hypnotize people?

414
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Well, in my other ASMR stream,

415
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
I think I managed to get quite a few.

416
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,500
I'm not doing hypnosis right now, though,

417
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,500
but I do have some hypnosis audios coming out in the plan.

418
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,500
I wonder if Andy and Lili was an inspiration for Emmy's lore?

419
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
No.

420
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
I had not actually played or consumed the game

421
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
when Emmy was conceptualized.

422
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
She was conceptualized in June last year.

423
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,500
The reason why Emmy is Emmy is because

424
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I'm a massive fucking pro con.

425
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Yeah, all the girls may or may not have been

426
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,500
mainly influenced by what I like.

427
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,500
I came to say this, but Emmy is everything.

428
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,500
If I had a later voice, I am not even kidding.

429
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,500
If I had a later voice, Emmy is exactly who

430
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
I would want to be as a content creator.

431
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,500
The lore, the oni-chan,

432
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,500
but I don't have a late voice, so I can't be Emmy.

433
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Ms. Morgan, thank you for becoming a member.

434
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Your hypnosis eyes animation is so unique.

435
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
It's so good.

436
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Like, wow.

437
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Oh, I think I need to get a little closer.

438
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Don't worry, I'm not hypnotizing you this stream.

439
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
What? Sorry.

440
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Um, but yeah.

441
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,500
If you really want to, like...

442
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,500
I'm not hypnotizing you, don't worry.

443
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
But yeah, that's my...

444
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,500
And I can also stack them

445
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,500
if you wanted a bigger focal point to focus on.

446
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,500
So it's kind of like a hidden spiral.

447
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Or, like this.

448
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,500
This is like very big, basic.

449
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
But yeah.

450
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
I will utilize these.

451
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Wow, I'm like really close.

452
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Is this too close?

453
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Do I need to be further away?

454
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
Or do you like seeing my teeth?

455
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Your eyes are so pretty. Thank you.

456
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,500
I love that all of us at VLR have unique pupils.

457
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
My...

458
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
It's a very nice distance.

459
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,500
Okay.

460
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
I'll stay here then.

461
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
My bangs are slightly transparent.

462
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Yeah, do you like seeing my eyebrows?

463
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Can you see my ears a little bit?

464
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Yeah.

465
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Get to some of my ear.

466
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Wow.

467
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,500
I promise I won't do any hypnotizing permanent events.

468
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I will.

469
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
An apple in a box.

470
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Thank you for the tip.

471
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
I think everyone should start manually breathing.

472
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
What have you done?

473
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
What have you unleashed upon these lands?

474
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Unleashed upon these lands?

475
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
I dare you.

476
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Speaking of AC.

477
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Hi, AC.

478
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Who's my adorable little feral?

479
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Merikisukaki.

480
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,500
What was AC doing in her stream?

481
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
I don't know.

482
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,500
I know you AC did back-to-back ASMR.

483
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
So do check out AC.

484
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
I also...

485
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
I'm going to spoil something because you're here.

486
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
AC, don't worry.

487
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,500
You don't have to talk because you'll be tired after stream.

488
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,500
There's going to be a collab ASMR channel on AC's channel.

489
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Of all the viewer girls.

490
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
And it's freaking adorable.

491
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
And I love it.

492
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
And I can't wait.

493
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
I can't wait.

494
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Post up quietly.

495
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Post up quietly.

496
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
AC played Tim Raider.

497
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Oh, that's fantastic.

498
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
I hope you guys enjoyed your Tim Raider.

499
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,500
More like Whim Raider when I'm done with her.

500
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Thank you, my Yari, for becoming a member.

501
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
And thank you, Boy, for the...

502
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Oh, my voice cracked.

503
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Thank you, Boy, for the five gifted memberships.

504
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Thank you, Boy, congrats to those who got the memberships.

505
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,500
You will have to exit the chat.

506
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Or is that loud?

507
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
That's not too loud, is it?

508
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
I can hear that little bloop.

509
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
That bloop isn't loud, right?

510
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
No.

511
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
Oh, it's quiet.

512
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Thank you so much.

513
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
It's really funny.

514
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
She raged a lot, but she was adorable.

515
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
She's so adorable.

516
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Kusugaki.

517
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
That's missing from your life.

518
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
I love her accent so much.

519
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Hi, Roller.

520
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Thank you for the...

521
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Pardon me.

522
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Thank you for the super jab.

523
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Any plans to do scripted ASMRs?

524
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,500
For the video tab for people who can't get to the streams?

525
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Yes, hi, Roller.

526
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,500
I am so happy to say those uploads start today.

527
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Oh, my tummy's rumbling.

528
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,500
My first meme ASMR is ready to be posted.

529
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I am going to post it today.

530
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,500
And I also owe you, yes, you, listening right now,

531
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:17,500
four ASMR videos because for every 1,000...

532
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,500
For every 1,000 subscribers,

533
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,500
I will be uploading one celebration ASMR video,

534
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,500
all of different ideas, different tingles, different varieties.

535
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
And that starts today.

536
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,500
And for the replayings who are worried about

537
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,500
filtering, I already told you my master plan.

538
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
So don't worry.

539
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,500
I already know what happens next.

540
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,500
I filtered myself for you.

541
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,500
I had a year to plan our thing together.

542
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,500
I made sure to do it accordingly.

543
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Yeah.

544
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Thank you, Stroni, for bringing feeler into existence.

545
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,500
The gift of AC is something I'll never be able to play.

546
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Replay, replay.

547
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Thank you for everything.

548
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Uchi-san, that's amazing.

549
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
I'm glad you can link AC.

550
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,500
You are definitely Uchi-san levels,

551
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,500
but if you're really good, AC may even call you daddy in her accent.

552
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,500
Thank you, Iki-to-emo no kuchi for becoming a member.

553
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,500
And thank you, Funky, for becoming a member.

554
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Thank you very much.

555
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Just as a reminder for members,

556
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,500
membership streams start next week

557
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,500
because the schedule for this week was pretty locked in.

558
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
And I just had a few background things.

559
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,500
I need to finish, but I'm like 100% sure.

560
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,500
By week three, I am officially-

561
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,500
I have no responsibilities of feeler,

562
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,500
and I am so freaking happy.

563
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,500
I'm gonna be lurking because I'm not workiest

564
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,500
where your audio sets so hard.

565
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,500
Have you ever thought about hypnotizing another girl a feeler?

566
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,500
She's welcome to listen to any of my audios at will.

567
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,500
I will not stop any of the girls,

568
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,500
but I would want to condition them to be a bit different.

569
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Maybe not condition them to respond to replay,

570
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:52,500
but instead to let me make a certain audio with them.

571
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,500
Of my C theme of a right egg,

572
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
can you imagine?

573
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,500
C theme hypnosis on one of my daughters.

574
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Oh, I-

575
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,500
Mommy, tomorrow, all the vehicular girls are together.

576
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,500
I'm so excited for a collab together.

577
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Special shout out to MarySafe for streaming so early,

578
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
as Sarah for being early,

579
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,500
and me for being early,

580
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
she be for being early,

581
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
and I see for being later.

582
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
I- like, it's so hard to pick a time zone,

583
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,500
and I was like,

584
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,500
if you guys do me this favor and do it at my regular stream time,

585
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,500
I will repay you in more shorts.

586
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,500
If Johnny was streamed responsibly in 12 hours a day,

587
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,500
are you supposed to keep up after the third week?

588
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Oh, that's the fun part.

589
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,500
The third week has four days of Elden Ring insurance streams,

590
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
because we need to play the DLC together.

591
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,500
Yeah, we have back to back to back to back

592
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,500
insurance streams on the third week,

593
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
because of Elden Ring.

594
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Oh.

595
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Curious, are you gonna do any non-gendered content?

596
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,500
I am so sorry.

597
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,500
I do he-him content,

598
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
and I apologize greatly.

599
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,500
I-

600
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,500
I don't want to say it simply gets harder to make the alternative content,

601
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,500
and thus, I make he-him.

602
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
I'm very sorry if that filler issue,

603
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,500
I completely understand if you no longer wish to watch,

604
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
because of that fact.

605
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,500
I don't know what the other girls were planning,

606
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,500
but I do know the name of some ASMR artists

607
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
that make female content.

608
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,500
One of them is a fan car ASMR, I believe.

609
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,500
She makes female for female content.

610
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,500
What's near last stream?

611
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
Congrats on monetization.

612
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Thank you.

613
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,500
I'll start in your character with me.

614
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Yeah.

615
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Time to not sleep for a week.

616
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Basically, week three is Elden Ring together,

617
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,500
and I'm gonna have my heart rate monitor

618
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
and a shock collar on,

619
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
and every time,

620
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,500
I cause us leaflings to lose the fight.

621
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,500
You guys get to shock me, basically,

622
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
and then on week four,

623
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,500
we're doing landscape endurance to get 99,

624
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,500
because I want to get 99 cooking,

625
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,500
and I will get it.

626
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,500
So, I believe on week four,

627
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,500
I will also tell you what movies we're doing,

628
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
watch alongs of,

629
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
so you guys can download it,

630
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,500
and I'll do the thing where I timestamp it on screen and all that.

631
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Yeah, I watched some already, still enjoying your other content.

632
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Yo, thank you so much.

633
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,500
I appreciate that,

634
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,500
and thank you for your understanding, surrounding it.

635
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,500
Mommy also sponsors other ASMRs.

636
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,500
You're so base.

637
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
I just want everyone to be,

638
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
I've literally forgotten to do tingles.

639
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,500
I'm just whispering at this point.

640
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,500
I just want everyone to be able to enjoy the content they consume,

641
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,500
and if that means I can help you find the person that speaks to you,

642
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,500
that Oshi,

643
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
or that person you really enjoy,

644
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
because like,

645
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,500
wait until I get done this rabbit hole, okay?

646
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,500
PS, thank you for the refling that encouraged me,

647
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,500
and marshmallow to go down all the rabbit holes I desire.

648
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
I will yank your ear off,

649
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,500
unapologetically from now on.

650
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,500
So, because of the way society is set up,

651
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,500
humans naturally need a face after work,

652
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,500
or after doing stressful situations.

653
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,500
A face can include alcohol,

654
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
a face can include smoking,

655
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,500
a face can include recreational drugs,

656
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,500
a face can include YouTubers,

657
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
feedubers, ASMR.

658
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,500
You should not be ashamed of what you need

659
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
to help you get through the day.

660
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Humans are not set up for the society

661
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
that we are currently living in right now,

662
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,500
and I will scream that from the rooftops

663
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,500
to not ever be embarrassed at all

664
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,500
for what you need to do to get through the day.

665
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
A face is also music.

666
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,500
You may listen to Mongolian throat singing.

667
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,500
I will not judge you for listening to Mongolian throat singing, okay?

668
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:47,500
So, that is why I am not a jealous feature bird.

669
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
I want you to thrive.

670
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,500
I want your health to be as best as it can be,

671
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
if that means after work,

672
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,500
instead of watching a vote of mine.

673
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,500
For example, you watch another creator.

674
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,500
I am happy.

675
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
You are able to de-stress yourself.

676
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,500
You are able to regulate your nervous system.

677
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,500
You are able to look after yourself, okay?

678
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,500
Think of yourself like a Sims.

679
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,500
You unironically have bars of needs,

680
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,500
and what happens to a Sim when you ignore their needs?

681
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Well, they start to lose it.

682
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,500
They start to have these unfortunate side effects.

683
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
They start to struggle with life.

684
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,500
They cannot function.

685
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,500
They cannot follow orders, okay?

686
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,500
So, please understand.

687
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
If you think to yourself right now,

688
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,500
Strawny, I don't think you're the one for me.

689
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,500
I implore you, my dear watcher.

690
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Please check out the other VLR girls.

691
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
They may vibe with you better.

692
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:58,500
If you like brats who are jealous quick,

693
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,500
you may enjoy AC Snow Paws.

694
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:07,500
If you enjoy unhinged, unapologetic memos,

695
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,500
you may enjoy my M.A.B. Sue, okay?

696
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,500
If you love someone that has a similar personality to me,

697
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:21,500
but isn't me, my God, you're gonna love Sheebie Cottonbomb.

698
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,500
If you want to feel little, and you want to feel small,

699
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,500
you want to feel cared for, you want to feel appreciated,

700
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:35,500
and you want to hear the most sexy voice in all the land,

701
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:42,500
assuredly, if you want someone who can be energetic,

702
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,500
it's so fun, it's so just perfect, and our default laugh,

703
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:55,500
our laugh is natural, then you may love Mercy Moddies, okay?

704
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,500
And I'm just getting so happy talking about them,

705
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
I'm forgetting to whisper.

706
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,500
Please check them out in the description, okay?

707
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Please, they deserve it.

708
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,500
They deserve a chance, the chance that you have given me,

709
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
give to them, okay?

710
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Thank you, dear watcher.

711
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,500
Ah, the girls may struggle trying to watch everyone.

712
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Yes, but those indulges so strong, yes.

713
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:32,500
Please indulge in my daughters at will.

714
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,500
I like virtual abuse, I can't deny it, yes.

715
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,500
Is there a new audio?

716
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,500
Wow!

717
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,500
What the heck?

718
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Thank you for the 100, oh my God, reluctantly saying that's a lot of money.

719
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,500
Still no idea how so much awesome is contained in one cut of fish.

720
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,500
We adore your last and will pass it to the doors, thank you.

721
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,500
I really appreciate that.

722
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Did I catch you off-guard?

723
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,500
Yeah, but you were distracted, weren't you?

724
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:19,500
Distracted by that no-no-by reluctantly saying, huh?

725
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,500
I completely caught you off-guard.

726
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,500
Did that cinch ever stand your spain?

727
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Reef-laying, are you that sensitive?

728
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,500
That's adorable.

729
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:40,500
You can't fill us with emotional speech and then backstabbing.

730
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:45,500
But thank you again for the 100, yes.

731
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,500
You caught me killed in destiny, shivers through everything.

732
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,500
You made me die in Isaac.

733
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:57,500
Speaking of backstabber, did you know that backstabber is an item you can pick up in Isaac

734
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:02,500
which deals double damage to enemies if your tear goes on the back of them?

735
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:08,500
So if you have things like tiny planet, which rotates tears around you, it's quite effective,

736
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,500
but you kinda need the distance, you caught me-

737
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,500
I'm not reading that out.

738
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,500
Almost sent me over the edge.

739
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,500
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.

740
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,500
Now I'm decent, we're not doing that.

741
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,500
That's for the membership streams.

742
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,500
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

743
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,500
Oh my god.

744
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
I'm kidding.

745
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Reef-laying.

746
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
Don't be silly.

747
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,500
The painting of Isaac mentioned.

748
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Never thought that Isaac combo, all the card.

749
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,500
You're kidding, but is she really?

750
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,500
What do you guys think about the emotes?

751
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,500
Has anyone found the secret to my emotes yet?

752
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,500
They're nostalgic.

753
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,500
I'm gonna get thy grip and stuff.

754
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,500
Every girl is doing great and they're really awesome, I'm happy.

755
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:22,500
I cannot even put into words how much amazing experience to have them.

756
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,500
It's just insane.

757
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,500
It's honestly insane.

758
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,500
I cannot believe the girls even applied.

759
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,500
And then they put up with my Scottish ass in the interview.

760
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:37,500
My interview technique is so unprofessional, it's not even funny.

761
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,500
I need to grind and RuneScape to help my main cooking supplies.

762
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
We have an insurance stream.

763
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:51,500
I'm just gonna yap and do Marshmallow, Queer, U.S. Jens during the RuneScape stream.

764
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,500
So feel free, I'll do a tweet about answering questions during the RuneScape.

765
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,500
I'm sure it'll lead me down some rubber holes.

766
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,500
Just realized Ronnie would do bleep damage.

767
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
I like painting things.

768
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,500
This is your warning.

769
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,500
You're in or you're out, refling.

770
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,500
Oh, hydration check, I've not had any liquid today.

771
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,500
All gone, daddy.

772
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:45,500
Okay, maybe I should actually clean your ears a little.

773
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,500
Debate marks show people that you own us.

774
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
Good girl.

775
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,500
Thank you.

776
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,500
I may or may not have drunk in so much whiskey.

777
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,500
Oh, you need to be careful, whiskey'll get you drunk.

778
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:14,500
Although, if there's any Belgian slurking, Belgian beer gets you drunk.

779
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,500
I had one Belgian beer and I was tipsy.

780
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,500
I didn't even finish it.

781
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,500
I was tipsy.

782
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
I'm like so late.

783
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,500
Late, wait, wait, what's that term?

784
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,500
Late, wait, wait, that's not the term.

785
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,500
I'm so late, wait, I can hardly handle alcohol.

786
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,500
What the heck is that word?

787
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,500
Late, wait, why is my drink?

788
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,500
Late, wait, oh, just dropped the E.T.

789
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Okay, sorry, I'm so late, wait, drinker.

790
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,500
Wait, why is that so confusing?

791
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,500
It's late, wait.

792
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,500
Those three words, if I stand up, my desk will come with me.

793
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,500
I love so much catching you guys off guard.

794
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,500
I don't know why it's so satisfying.

795
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,500
Like, I can be so wholesome talking to you.

796
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,500
Like, saying all these, like, just talking in general.

797
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,500
And then I come up with three words and you're gone.

798
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,500
Like, ah, don't give me that power.

799
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,500
Don't do it.

800
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,500
It's over for both of us if you give me that power.

801
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,500
The less you wait, the drunker you get.

802
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
I don't even know how much I wait.

803
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,500
I wonder if you guys can really pinch press me.

804
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,500
Are you planning on making role-play audios in the future?

805
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,500
Yes.

806
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,500
I have a role-play coming out.

807
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,500
It's a meme though, but the other ones are role-plays.

808
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,500
But I have a meme role-play.

809
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,500
Yeah, the both of us, me and you, we fling.

810
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,500
It was over before we began.

811
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,500
I could deadlift you for sure.

812
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
I can branch press you with ease.

813
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,500
Can't pinch press, can't pinch press, can't pinch press.

814
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:01,500
Someone sent me a very naughty, naughty marshmallow.

815
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
They were like...

816
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,500
They were like, I go to the gym so I can pinch you.

817
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
Into a wall.

818
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
And I'll leave it at that.

819
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,500
I'm afraid you had that power all along.

820
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
Nice.

821
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,500
I probably can't pinch press you, but I can do a different press.

822
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,500
I have crushed a watermelon between my thighs.

823
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
You'll be much different.

824
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,500
The inspiration to get more fat.

825
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,500
I go to the gym for the Phil Nelson.

826
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,500
You'll never guess why I'm so flexible, really.

827
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
I'd say you can Nelson me.

828
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,500
I brushy brushy your ear.

829
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Okay, let me check marshmallows.

830
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
My little marshmallows.

831
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
Have I got a new one?

832
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Wow.

833
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,500
I've been massively into hypnosis for ages now,

834
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,500
but I've never been able to find someone who's voice I love.

835
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:36,500
And now I finally get someone who's both a nurses streamer.

836
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:40,500
And I can watch for Arizona in long story short.

837
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Thanks. Keep doing what you're doing.

838
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,500
You're doing amazing. Thank you.

839
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:50,500
I honestly thought my Scottish accent would be a bit of a barrier,

840
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,500
but I am very glad to hear it now.

841
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
Feels good, man.

842
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,500
That's right, you are falling under my spell.

843
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,500
You're not, you're not, you're not.

844
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,500
I was wondering if there's an official public Twitter list.

845
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,500
No, you have to go find the alternative twitters.

846
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,500
We can't link to them.

847
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,500
Against the rules.

848
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,500
Sorry.

849
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,500
I didn't, I didn't create the game.

850
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,500
I just play it, okay?

851
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,500
So the girls can't link to the alternatives.

852
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Sorry.

853
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Just check who the girls follow on Twitter.

854
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
Thank you.

855
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Someone says, have I done professional voice acting?

856
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,500
No.

857
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Do I sound like I do professional voice acting?

858
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,500
What do you even do when you go to a meeting?

859
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Like, what even occurs?

860
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,500
I assume they tell you what vocal warm-ups are.

861
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Like...

862
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,500
Or something like that.

863
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
Donate the player, I hate the game.

864
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,500
Yeah.

865
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,500
I wonder if I can get double hypnotized.

866
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,500
Can you say burglary?

867
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,500
I haven't.

868
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:23,500
I wonder, can we get one stream without someone asking for a purple burglary alarm?

869
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,500
But yes, I can say it, but if I'm in my heavy accent,

870
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,500
then...

871
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,500
Wait, can I whisper into a heavy accent?

872
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
Purple burglary.

873
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
Hala!

874
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,500
It's funny because right now they're all some more followers than their mates.

875
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,500
Oh, we know what the people want, we give it for free.

876
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:50,500
When other VTubers are being greedy, free.

877
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,500
Come home, viewer.

878
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Reject capitalism.

879
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,500
Reject corporate greed.

880
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:07,500
We'll look after you, even if you don't give us a penny.

881
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:14,500
Shhh, it's okay, I know, I know it's a hard concept.

882
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,500
Did I talk about that on my 2.0?

883
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Someone was like, feeler is gonna fail because of the 80-20 split.

884
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:31,500
And it's like, oh you poor sweet summer child.

885
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:39,500
You are so deep that you can't imagine a successful business without corporate greed.

886
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,500
Shhh, it's okay, it's okay, you've been brainwashed.

887
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,500
I'll undo the damage.

888
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:54,500
And together, we've got a city to burn.

889
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,500
We're gonna wipe the dust out of everyone.

890
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,500
The whole world will no longer be.

891
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:06,500
Okay, that's it, we're watching Fate Club again.

892
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:11,500
You wonder why Fate Club is one of my favorite movies.

893
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:16,500
Not just because of the race-nove plot.

894
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:21,500
It sounds like Silverheart based.

895
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,500
It's joining Hypnosis Stream, breaking capitalism,

896
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,500
mind-washing you to show you you can be successful without greed.

897
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,500
Yes.

898
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,500
I'm glad we got based.

899
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:38,500
Encourage people to give when they already get a taste.

900
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,500
277 playthrough, I've never actually played the game.

901
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
I'd like to try it together.

902
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,500
Never seen Fate Club or we're watching it again, baby.

903
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,500
We are watching Fate Club again.

904
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Hammer and Scythe, oh no, that's actually,

905
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,500
I am going to take you about region-locked capitalism.

906
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,500
So before capitalism, there's this thing called Fatuism.

907
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,500
I can't remember it.

908
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,500
But basically, it's just region-locked capitalism.

909
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,500
It's freaking crazy.

910
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,500
I wanna do a massive deep dive into it.

911
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,500
And like seriously, if you start learning about history

912
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,500
and how humans were before,

913
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,500
the quicker we are all going to get a farm together

914
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,500
and all the reflicks come on the farm with me.

915
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
And we have chickens.

916
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,500
And we have protein from the eggs of the chickens.

917
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,500
And we grow our own produce.

918
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:36,500
And we realize quickly that you need community to survive.

919
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:40,500
Because if you are telling, sorry, I'm going down the rebel,

920
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:47,500
you're telling me that all these companies are recording record profits.

921
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,500
And we're going to cause the living crisis.

922
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
But it's not artificial.

923
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,500
And all the farmers say that nothing has changed in their production line.

924
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,500
Hell yeah, we've got a city of burn.

925
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,500
We're going to do it right fucking there.

926
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,500
Oh, don't get me started.

927
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Don't do it briefly.

928
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,500
Calm.

929
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,500
Keep me calm, refling.

930
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,500
Keep me calm.

931
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,500
It's okay.

932
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,500
It's okay.

933
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Just a question, can you watch movies on membership streams?

934
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
Boy, you are getting spoiled for that.

935
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,500
I absolutely love sharing movies.

936
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,500
And watching them for the first time.

937
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,500
I'm going to be watching Austin Powers for the first time.

938
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Cause you guys are drawing me.

939
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:57,500
Saying that Fond de la Buseau is an Austin Powers enemy name.

940
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,500
So we're watching Austin Powers for the first time.

941
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,500
Um, yeah.

942
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:09,500
We love when you go Gremlin mode.

943
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,500
It's okay, Strani. You'll get on one day.

944
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,500
Yeah.

945
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Feral aggressive ASMR.

946
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,500
Well, I did bait in the ear ASMR.

947
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Like actually grivelling at the mic and bait in the ear.

948
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,500
But it's going to have to be a Twitter video.

949
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,500
Uh, your infantry anti-capitalist ASMR with soft kisses.

950
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,500
Yeah.

951
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,500
See, wait until you get further into the rabbit hole.

952
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,500
So on an individual scale, it's good to not be in debt.

953
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,500
For the way that the economy is set up.

954
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,500
They want you to be in debt.

955
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,500
And wait until you're the kicker.

956
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:53,500
Mortgages, 30 year, 25 year mortgages.

957
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,500
Or just normalize debt.

958
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,500
You don't own that house.

959
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,500
For 25 years, for 30 years, you're in debt.

960
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,500
We need to bring back multi-generational households.

961
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,500
Okay.

962
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,500
That needs to be brought back.

963
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,500
But they aren't going to let you do that.

964
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:19,500
Why do you think one business on 60% of the fricking proper ace in America

965
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,500
How can I listen?

966
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:28,500
Okay, shh, ASMR, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, ASMR.

967
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,500
Relax.

968
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,500
It's okay.

969
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:46,500
I can't tell if I'm saying it's okay for you, refling, or it's okay for me to calm down.

970
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,500
You know what, listen to my heart.

971
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:54,500
It's time to listen to my heart so you can hear how fricking serious I am.

972
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500
Right, are you ready?

973
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,500
Oh, let me, I'm lifting up my hoodie for you, refling.

974
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,500
It's okay, refling.

975
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:17,500
Let's go on a journey together.

976
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,500
We'll go on a farm, alright?

977
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,500
And I'll be over a farm.

978
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,500
And we'll have chickens.

979
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,500
And we'll have ducks.

980
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:36,500
Because ducks are good for eating slugs and bugs that are the crops.

981
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,500
And there'll be a big pond.

982
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,500
And the ducks will be so happy.

983
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,500
And we can go on a big walk around the farm.

984
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:53,500
And I'll show you all my seed collection because it'll be so big.

985
01:07:53,500 --> 01:08:00,500
And I get to grow nasturtials.

986
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:05,500
I get to put nasturtials all around the garden.

987
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,500
And there'll be so many bees.

988
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,500
Lots of bees.

989
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,500
And bugs.

990
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:20,500
Maybe, just maybe we may even have honey bugs.

991
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:26,500
And we'll grow lots of native flowers that are good for all the wildlife.

992
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,500
And there'll be birds.

993
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,500
And cami will come.

994
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:38,500
And we'll have lots of magpie families.

995
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:44,500
And in the end, everything will be okay, refling.

996
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,500
Because it always works out in the end.

997
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,500
Doesn't it?

998
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,500
It took me a year to get here.

999
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,500
To get back to where we were.

1000
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,500
And here we are.

1001
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,500
All the stress.

1002
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,500
The worry.

1003
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,500
The doubt.

1004
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:11,500
The doubt if I could even be here.

1005
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,500
And we did it.

1006
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,500
We did it.

1007
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,500
It took us so long.

1008
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:30,500
I hope it feels like it was no time at all.

1009
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:34,500
And I didn't take long.

1010
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:38,500
And it was a blink of an eye.

1011
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,500
No more waiting.

1012
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,500
No more yearning.

1013
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,500
Me and you.

1014
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:51,500
To the man.

1015
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,500
I wish I had made you sooner.

1016
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
Oh, don't worry.

1017
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,500
I am strong in cuddles.

1018
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,500
And you are my refling.

1019
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:09,500
And that is all we need.

1020
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,500
It feels good to be home.

1021
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,500
Feels good to be home.

1022
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,500
My little refling.

1023
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:24,500
I love you.

1024
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,500
Okay, next.

1025
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:30,500
I need to milk you.

1026
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,500
You're being so patient.

1027
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,500
I hope you stay for a long time.

1028
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,500
Have you got three years?

1029
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,500
I think I've got three years.

1030
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
You are my favorite person.

1031
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,500
I love you.

1032
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,500
You can't keep getting away with that.

1033
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,500
I love you too.

1034
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,500
Let me pet your other ear.

1035
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,500
What was that at the end?

1036
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,500
Nothing.

1037
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,500
What happens after three years?

1038
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,500
I don't know.

1039
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,500
I just thought...

1040
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,500
I don't know.

1041
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,500
I don't know what happens.

1042
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,500
We don't have to think about that now, okay?

1043
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,500
You have me for the next 100.

1044
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,500
She's gonna evolve.

1045
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
I could, if you want.

1046
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,500
Or, if you want, what we pretend to be.

1047
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,500
And who will pretend to be A.C.

1048
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,500
And my new persona.

1049
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,500
Hello, guys.

1050
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,500
I'm A.C. Snow Falls.

1051
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,500
And today, we are going to...

1052
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,500
Do ASMR.

1053
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,500
What? I'm not strannic couples.

1054
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,500
Stop calling me strannic couples.

1055
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,500
I'm not strannic.

1056
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,500
I don't even know who that is.

1057
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,500
I can't really do a lighter voice.

1058
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,500
Light eyes.

1059
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,500
Light eyes.

1060
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,500
Light strannic couples.

1061
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,500
Monster HMC.

1062
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,500
Thank you for becoming a member.

1063
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:40,500
Oh, the bread's really evolving to biblically accurate strannic.

1064
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,500
Oh my god, that's so adorable.

1065
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,500
That urge to A.

1066
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,500
Are you gonna ink to my RP?

1067
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Free-flying?

1068
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:56,500
Even I admit that's a bit general.

1069
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:05,500
What was cute when I tried to pretend to be A.C.?

1070
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:09,500
I would need to watch more of A.C.'s streams.

1071
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,500
To mimic her accent.

1072
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,500
But I really fell in love with A.C.'s accent.

1073
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,500
Sorry, my voice is a bit damaged.

1074
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,500
So it's harder for me to talk.

1075
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,500
Why am I roleplaying as Casey?

1076
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,500
Have you missed me?

1077
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,500
Did you watch my Tomb Raider stream?

1078
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,500
Wait.

1079
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,500
You didn't watch my Tomb Raider stream, A.C.

1080
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,500
But you only watched my ASMR?

1081
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:55,500
You don't like me, do you, A.C.?

1082
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,500
You disgust me.

1083
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:03,500
If you were a real A.C., you'd watch everything.

1084
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,500
But you don't.

1085
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,500
You forget to subscribe to me.

1086
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,500
You forget to like the streams, A.C.

1087
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,500
I think you need punishment.

1088
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,500
Yes.

1089
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,500
A.C. sun.

1090
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,500
Sit on the floor.

1091
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,500
Open your legs, A.C. sun.

1092
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
What do you mean?

1093
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,500
What am I doing with my boot?

1094
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,500
I'm punishing you, A.C. sun.

1095
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:45,500
Is that weird to roleplay as my genmys?

1096
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,500
I think that's a bit odd.

1097
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,500
I think that was rather odd with me.

1098
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,500
I'm not sure if that was weird.

1099
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,500
A.C. will laugh at that.

1100
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,500
I hope so.

1101
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,500
Sorry, my voice is very broken.

1102
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:06,500
Whenever I do ASMR, my voice gets so broken.

1103
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,500
I think A.C. will like your jokes on you.

1104
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,500
I'm into that.

1105
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,500
Turned an issue beyond the hint.

1106
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,500
Mercy next.

1107
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,500
Oh, Mercy, I can't do it.

1108
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,500
Surprise!

1109
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,500
Surprise!

1110
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,500
She's so energetic.

1111
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,500
Hypnotized to believe I'm A.C.

1112
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,500
I wonder what TV is, audio I could make.

1113
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,500
It's called voice acting.

1114
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,500
Anyway, thank you A.C. for coming on stream.

1115
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,500
I do appreciate that.

1116
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,500
This is exactly why A.C. streams.

1117
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,500
Can you?

1118
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
I can't believe it.

1119
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,500
I pretend I'm A.C.

1120
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,500
and I already...

1121
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,500
I'm already getting my thoughts new.

1122
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:03,500
Who are you and what have you done with Strani?

1123
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,500
I'm back.

1124
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,500
All flower is gone.

1125
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,500
When will we see?

1126
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,500
You're late again.

1127
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,500
So I'm to die for and proud Edwards army.

1128
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,500
Can you do a Strani couple's impression?

1129
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,500
Why do you think A.C. redirected into me?

1130
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,500
I am A.C.

1131
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,500
I am A.C.

1132
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,500
I am A.C.

1133
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,500
I almost just made a noise if you heard that.

1134
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,500
I am A.C.

1135
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,500
I am A.C.

1136
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,500
I am Mercy.

1137
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,500
They're all me.

1138
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,500
Don't you get it?

1139
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,500
I win.

1140
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,500
You lose.

1141
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,500
I love you, Strani.

1142
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,500
I'll catch up with the Vots since I love the ASMR.

1143
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,500
Thank you, Tainee, Spani.

1144
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,500
Let's see if you remember how to say my name this time.

1145
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,500
Oh god, I'm so sorry.

1146
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,500
Tainee, Spani.

1147
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,500
Tainee, Spani.

1148
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,500
Spain, E.

1149
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,500
Tainee, Spani.

1150
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,500
Thank you for the tips.

1151
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,500
I love the ASMR content.

1152
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
Please, let's see if you remember.

1153
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,500
OBS, let's see if you remember.

1154
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,500
Tainee, Spain, E.

1155
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,500
I am Fielder.

1156
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,500
I wish I could do a manic laughter right now.

1157
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,500
Tainee, Spain, E.

1158
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,500
I am Fielder.

1159
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,500
I wish I could do a manic laughter right now.

1160
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,500
Sorry, that was quite loud.

1161
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,500
D'you even hear my heartbeat?

1162
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,500
D'you even hear my heartbeat?

1163
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,500
You remembered.

1164
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,500
I'm so proud of you.

1165
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,500
D'you even hear my heartbeat?

1166
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,500
You remembered.

1167
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,500
I'm so proud of you.

1168
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,500
Yeah.

1169
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,300
Have you ever seen us in the same stream together?

1170
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,800
No, you haven't.

1171
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,200
My beloved skizzle cutouts!

1172
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,200
Yay!

1173
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,400
Skizzle mode.

1174
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,200
We're gaining your personality,

1175
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,900
any pieces identified.

1176
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Onee-chan.

1177
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,600
Onee-chan.

1178
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,500
Listen, I can tell us.

1179
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Onee-chan.

1180
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Onee-chan.

1181
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I love you, Onee-chan.

1182
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,500
I missed you.

1183
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I can't do it. Why is it so hard?

1184
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Let's go.

1185
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Let's go again.

1186
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,500
There's no way I can do Isara.

1187
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Hello?

1188
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,500
No.

1189
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,500
Isara is too low for me.

1190
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,500
She's so far too low.

1191
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,500
Well...

1192
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,500
I'm trying to mimic her accent as well,

1193
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,500
because she has a...

1194
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,500
It's not on me.

1195
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:02,500
I only use my brain cells to calibrate onee, you see?

1196
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,500
Give me a sentence for Isara to say.

1197
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,500
Oh dear, bleeding hearts.

1198
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,500
It's been so long.

1199
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,500
My voice is cracking,

1200
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,500
but I'm kind of there.

1201
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,500
You've done me so well,

1202
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,500
as a goddess waiting.

1203
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,500
It's not that.

1204
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,500
Hey sweetie.

1205
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,500
Yeah, Isara is impossible.

1206
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,500
You sound like you're dying.

1207
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,500
You sound like you're dying trying to mimic your tone.

1208
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,500
I've missed you.

1209
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,500
My bleeding.

1210
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,500
My voice is a bit too soft.

1211
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,500
I apologise.

1212
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,500
You can't just build on each unguard.

1213
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,500
Oh, it's like literally my top one kick.

1214
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:06,500
I'm like, it's like, that has to be tier one for me.

1215
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,500
What would the second be?

1216
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,500
The other whole, yeah.

1217
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,500
Yeah.

1218
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,500
Try Sheebie.

1219
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,500
Try.

1220
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
Sheebie's deeper than me, I think.

1221
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,500
I can't do Sheebie.

1222
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,500
Have you been a good boy?

1223
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,500
That's not how Sheebie says.

1224
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,500
It's because she's a deeper tone.

1225
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,500
I'm so sorry.

1226
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,500
Wait, what did Sheebie say?

1227
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,500
Oh, Heron.

1228
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,500
Oh, Heron.

1229
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,500
Oh, Heron.

1230
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,500
Oh, I can't do it.

1231
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,500
She'd be from Wish.

1232
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,500
You don't fuck you.

1233
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,500
You need to call a trash.

1234
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,500
You are trash.

1235
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,500
Nothing but trash.

1236
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,500
Mercy.

1237
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,500
Mercy.

1238
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,500
Mercy's higher pitched than me.

1239
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,500
Senpai's like misty so much.

1240
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,500
Senpai.

1241
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,500
My voice is cracking on the giggle.

1242
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Oh, that's pretty bad,

1243
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,500
cracking on the giggle.

1244
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,500
Senpai's.

1245
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,500
Did you miss me, Senpai's?

1246
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:53,500
I'm not even going to pretend that I can do any Vietnamese.

1247
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,500
Try her Yandere laugh.

1248
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,500
Wait, I'll lower my volume.

1249
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:06,500
I'll see if I can do it in the same laugh like Mercy.

1250
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,500
Okay.

1251
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,500
There we go.

1252
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,500
Igor, thank you for the...

1253
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,500
Wait a minute, Igor, aren't you from my puzzle stream?

1254
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,500
Remember when Yumi confessed that she pooped herself before the stream?

1255
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,500
That was just strong, even.

1256
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,500
Thank you for the 5, Igor.

1257
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:39,500
I'm pretty sure you're from that puzzle game, because I see rated into me.

1258
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:43,500
And then everyone started saying Igor, and I was like, what the heck is Igor?

1259
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,500
And then everyone said it was from the puzzle game.

1260
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,500
And I was like, oh yeah, that's a puzzle game.

1261
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,500
Yes, I watched it.

1262
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,500
This one says you're scaring me.

1263
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,500
I told you, I'm all a violour, you don't trust me?

1264
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,500
You didn't even believe me?

1265
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,500
Just because I've got a Scottish accent doesn't mean I can't mimic your waifu.

1266
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,500
It's okay.

1267
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,500
You're allowed to be scared, aren't you?

1268
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,500
Oh, did you hear that whistle as I breathed in there?

1269
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,500
I love you.

1270
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,500
Your voice actually kind of works on the food.

1271
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,500
Of course my voice works.

1272
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:25,500
Everything I do works.

1273
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,500
Everything I touch succeeds.

1274
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,500
Don't you understand?

1275
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,500
I control all of this.

1276
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:38,500
If I want to live, I live.

1277
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:41,500
If I want to take, I take.

1278
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:47,500
And if I want you to die, you die.

1279
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,500
That was an Assassin's Creed Brotherhood quote, by the way.

1280
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,500
Please do not panic.

1281
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,500
Hydration check.

1282
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,500
I feel like you could tell whether it's strawny or someone else's voice.

1283
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,500
Swing!

1284
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,500
Strawny, you just can't have your way.

1285
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,500
Hydration check, okay.

1286
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:16,500
I have my finger in all the pies, my tentacles, and everywhere.

1287
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,500
Can you please touch the side even?

1288
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,500
There's only so much I love what color fish would do.

1289
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:31,500
Okay, I'll go back to whispering because my voice doesn't crack when I whisper for some reason.

1290
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:36,500
But if I try and do so, I've spoken ASMR, it's just like completely messed up.

1291
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,500
Much love, do you?

1292
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,500
Oh, yeah.

1293
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,500
Was that a swing from Queen's World?

1294
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,500
Yeah, I've never seen it.

1295
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,500
I've just seen meme complete.

1296
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,500
Like the highlights and the echo swing.

1297
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,500
Good memories from Assassin's Creed.

1298
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,500
Oh, yeah.

1299
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:58,500
Once that we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on the tenth of June, can't wait to see you there.

1300
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:05,500
Oh, yeah, definitely a motion that was nothing else.

1301
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,500
Yeah.

1302
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,500
By the pool.

1303
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,500
Wow!

1304
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,500
Congrats on the interview.

1305
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,500
I hope it went well.

1306
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,500
Thank you, Grandpa.

1307
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,500
That's very kind of you to give a tip.

1308
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,500
You don't have to do that.

1309
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,500
And just share the wealth.

1310
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,500
Share the load.

1311
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,500
If you didn't know, there's a quote in Lord of the Rings.

1312
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,500
We're so anguished at photo.

1313
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,500
Share the load.

1314
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,500
You'd share your load with me, right?

1315
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,500
Reef one.

1316
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,500
Thank you again, Grandpa, for the chip.

1317
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,500
I appreciate it.

1318
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,500
And I go for the super chat.

1319
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,500
I don't think I said that.

1320
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,500
You said insurance.

1321
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,500
Sorry, my tummy's rumbling.

1322
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,500
I haven't eaten anything.

1323
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,500
You said insurance agent.

1324
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
Okay.

1325
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,500
I wonder what that's like.

1326
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,500
Are you gonna be on the phone?

1327
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:17,500
I wonder.

1328
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,500
But yeah, you don't actually have to share your wealth.

1329
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,500
Make sure your bills are paid.

1330
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,500
Make sure your bills are paid.

1331
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,500
And then any debts.

1332
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,500
And then if you are in the position to dip or donate,

1333
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
please consider a dollar first.

1334
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:35,500
If you can only do one, always pick a dollar over me.

1335
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
I produce free content all the time.

1336
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500
You just have to let me cook.

1337
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:45,500
Yeah, you're making me make noises.

1338
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,500
Go down.

1339
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,500
How do you think the girls were made?

1340
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:54,500
Share the wealth and photos face me,

1341
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,500
Greg's bill.

1342
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,500
Stoney, that was too powerful.

1343
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,500
Like, I like catching you off-card.

1344
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,500
One minute, you think I'm about to narrow down

1345
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,500
about Lord of the Rings.

1346
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:11,500
Next minute, your tentacle is up.

1347
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:17,500
Nice try, but I need my energy today.

1348
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,500
Okay, let me refresh my marshmallow.

1349
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,500
Ah, there's marshmallows.

1350
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,500
Thank you.

1351
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,500
Hi, Stoney.

1352
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,500
First, I love you.

1353
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,500
I love your red light.

1354
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,500
Secondly, I have two movies that I would give my life,

1355
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,500
not for you to watch.

1356
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:34,500
Please keep it and remember to eat anything with tomatoes in it.

1357
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,500
More tomato, the better for your boss.

1358
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,500
Napoleon Dynamite.

1359
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,500
I've never seen that.

1360
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,500
This is one of my favorite movies.

1361
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,500
It's a unique indie movie that is weird in the best way possible.

1362
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:50,500
The other one would be Talladega Night.

1363
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,500
Talladega Night.

1364
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,500
What?

1365
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,500
Talladega Night.

1366
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,500
And it's a comedy that's really goofy and fun.

1367
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:04,500
Yeah, I'm 100% open to movie suggestions.

1368
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:08,500
I'm going to see if I can push three membership streams.

1369
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,500
One by default is a watch along.

1370
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:15,500
One by default is ASMR membership.

1371
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:19,500
And then a third one is either a short video game,

1372
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:22,500
a game we might have already played before,

1373
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:27,500
or maybe a multiplayer stream-snap kind of experience.

1374
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:32,500
But yeah, please don't be afraid to suggest things you want to see.

1375
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,500
I am very open to any suggestions of content.

1376
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,500
I don't mind at all.

1377
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,500
Some feed chippers might not like it.

1378
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,500
I do not mind at all.

1379
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,500
I'd love to deliver what you seek.

1380
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:46,500
Thank you for your nice message.

1381
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,500
Princess Breed.

1382
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,500
How open to your horror movies?

1383
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,500
I'm 100% open to horror movies.

1384
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,500
I'll even wear my heart rate monitor if you like.

1385
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,500
I don't mind at all.

1386
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,500
Sounds like you're going to love Cyberpunk 27.7.

1387
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,500
You're just like Johnny Silverhand.

1388
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,500
Johnny Silverhand?

1389
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,500
Oh, if he wants to burn down society.

1390
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:17,500
Okay, I'm going to enjoy Cyberpunk.

1391
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:26,500
I wish I got the super and then I got censored kind of smart autism.

1392
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:29,500
But I'm stuck with a pro wrestling fan autism.

1393
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,500
It's okay, brother.

1394
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,500
Much old man Randy Savage.

1395
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:40,500
I used to watch The Stinger or The Wasp as a child.

1396
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,500
So don't worry if you like pro wrestling.

1397
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
I know some names.

1398
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,500
Yeah.

1399
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,500
Society.

1400
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,500
Society.

1401
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:54,500
I think it's society.

1402
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,500
Yeah, sorry.

1403
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,500
Society.

1404
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,500
Society.

1405
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,500
Society.

1406
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,500
Anonymous.

1407
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,500
Why?

1408
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,500
Why 100 with no message?

1409
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,500
Anon, what the fuck?

1410
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,500
Thank you.

1411
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,500
What the fuck?

1412
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,500
Why so much money?

1413
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,500
Thank you for the 100.

1414
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,500
What the fuck Anon?

1415
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:31,500
And no, do not donate to put a message that says nothing.

1416
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,500
So Brian reads out nothing.

1417
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
I know exactly what you're doing.

1418
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,500
I can see you smiling to yourself,

1419
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,500
being all proud that you dipped without a message.

1420
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,500
I see you.

1421
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,500
Don't think I don't.

1422
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,500
I'm staring into your soul.

1423
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,500
Don't do it.

1424
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,500
Bad Anon, bad boy.

1425
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:59,500
You're a bad, bad man, Anon.

1426
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:03,500
Do you know what happens to bad men?

1427
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:07,500
They need punishment.

1428
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,500
That's a A.C. bring your boot in.

1429
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
How is it my turn again?

1430
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
Yay, boot time.

1431
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
Good.

1432
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,500
Anon.

1433
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,500
Anon.

1434
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,500
What did I say?

1435
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,500
What did I fucking say, Anon?

1436
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,500
I called it.

1437
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
You were already freaking typing it in the box.

1438
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,500
Thank you for the tip, Anon.

1439
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,500
No, do not.

1440
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,500
No, do not.

1441
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,500
I'm ginger too.

1442
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,500
I'm ginger too,

1443
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
although someone said it looked like a war mill.

1444
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,500
And I was like, honestly, I don't care.

1445
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,500
It looked like a war mill.

1446
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,500
You call me there.

1447
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,500
Tips refuses to call me.

1448
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,500
It leaves, literally.

1449
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,500
I don't know what to do.

1450
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,500
I'm getting second feelings of scolding.

1451
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,500
Should I do scolding ASMR?

1452
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,500
Should I do scolding ASMR?

1453
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,500
I'm an actual fucking agent.

1454
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,500
What the fuck are you mean?

1455
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,500
I can't hear you.

1456
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,500
Don't make a noise for the rest of the night.

1457
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
I actually can't believe that embarrassment.

1458
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,500
You, of course, made it on the playground today.

1459
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,500
What do you want me to drink?

1460
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,500
What do you want me to drink?

1461
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,500
Do you know what they say?

1462
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,500
We've got to say it in Scotland.

1463
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,500
Is this Lassie Bashers?

1464
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,500
You're not supposed to be a Lassie Bashers.

1465
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,500
I didn't leave.

1466
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,500
Don't scare me while I get there.

1467
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,500
This is actually true in Scotland.

1468
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,500
On the playground,

1469
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,500
you're told not to hit girls.

1470
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,500
And the way you're told not to hit girls

1471
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,500
is you get called

1472
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,500
a Lassie Basher.

1473
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,500
This is true.

1474
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,500
Any Scots lurking

1475
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,500
know what a Lassie Basher is.

1476
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,500
You'll basically get called a Lassie Basher

1477
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,500
and bullied and picked on

1478
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,500
for hitting girls you do not hit girls

1479
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,500
in Scotland.

1480
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,500
And then,

1481
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,500
wait until you look at

1482
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,500
the domestic violence rates.

1483
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,500
Lassie Bashers

1484
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,500
doesn't work.

1485
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,500
Which one of you

1486
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:05,500
took a shit

1487
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,500
and did they push that tie line?

1488
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,500
Don't bash my Lassies.

1489
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,500
I got most of that

1490
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,500
and enjoyed it.

1491
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,500
I literally, oh that was my collar

1492
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,500
cracking if you heard that.

1493
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,500
I have many movies

1494
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,500
are we playing in advance?

1495
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,500
Are we having any moves

1496
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,500
are you playing in advance on this big chess game?

1497
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,500
Notting in nothing

1498
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,500
can stop you.

1499
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,500
Oh, I learned long ago

1500
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,500
if you ever stream

1501
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,500
or make primary content

1502
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,500
ASMR and then you deviate

1503
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,500
from that

1504
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,500
people are like

1505
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,500
waste ASMR, waste ASMR

1506
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,500
and then they filter themselves

1507
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,500
so I took that knowledge

1508
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,500
of your little wifling.

1509
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,500
So don't be nervous

1510
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,500
if you see my sub numbers

1511
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,500
going up.

1512
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,500
It's already been planned.

1513
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,500
Thank you for trusting

1514
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,500
me little wifling.

1515
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,500
Do you like 18 plus

1516
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,500
art if there's a male

1517
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,500
involved?

1518
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,500
Mercy's Edge is not like fan art.

1519
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
You

1520
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,500
can make it a generic

1521
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,500
white outline of a guy

1522
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,500
like a protagonist, like self insert

1523
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,500
protagonist

1524
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,500
in order

1525
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,500
excuse me stomach

1526
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,500
in order to make it

1527
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,500
a wifling

1528
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
you just need to put a nicotine patch

1529
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,500
on it.

1530
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,500
Yeah.

1531
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,500
Oh my stomach's really rumbling.

1532
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,500
Maybe I should put the mic to my stomach.

1533
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,500
You literally

1534
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,500
yes

1535
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,500
just put a nicotine patch

1536
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,500
on a white outline

1537
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,500
of a guy if you want like a guy

1538
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
stand and think thing going on.

1539
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,500
That's how you draw wifling.

1540
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,500
Yeah.

1541
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,500
A scrawny was wondering

1542
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,500
if you try a new monster on her.

1543
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,500
There's a new monster

1544
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,500
on her. Sorry.

1545
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,500
There's a new monster on her.

1546
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,500
I didn't even know that.

1547
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,500
I want to put my entire

1548
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,500
tongue inside you.

1549
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,500
The other one.

1550
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,500
You are cute.

1551
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,500
Thank you.

1552
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,500
I'm glad you like it.

1553
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,500
Oh it comes in next year.

1554
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,500
Okay.

1555
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,500
Shh.

1556
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,500
Do you want to hear my tummy?

1557
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
Okay. I'll let you hear my tummy.

1558
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,500
I know.

1559
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,500
I haven't eaten today.

1560
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,500
So I don't know how loud

1561
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,500
and maybe you may actually hear my heart.

1562
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,500
I'll put you on my belly.

1563
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,500
Do you hear anything?

1564
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,500
Oh.

1565
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,500
Do you hear it?

1566
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,500
You're just above

1567
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,500
my belly button.

1568
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,500
Are you a little bit hungry?

1569
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,500
Yeah.

1570
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,500
I haven't had anything to eat.

1571
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,500
Yeah.

1572
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,500
I don't really eat before stream.

1573
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,500
But yeah.

1574
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,500
When I make

1575
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,500
the

1576
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,500
pregnant with you ASMR

1577
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,500
it's going to have my actual tummy

1578
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,500
signs in it.

1579
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,500
Like you really are in the womb.

1580
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,500
Go eat.

1581
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,500
I don't want to eat after stream.

1582
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,500
I have 20 minutes.

1583
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,500
Thank you.

1584
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,500
That's my tummy.

1585
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,500
Do you hear stomach sounds

1586
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,500
or my new favorite trigger?

1587
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,500
Oh a few stomach sound ASMR.

1588
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,500
I'll make that.

1589
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,500
That's so easy to make.

1590
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,500
Literally 15 minutes of silence.

1591
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,500
I just stick a microphone to my stomach.

1592
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,500
You can 100% have that.

1593
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,500
Maybe I can name it something like

1594
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,500
my girlfriend's stomach ASMR

1595
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,500
but it won't stop f-ing rumbling

1596
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,500
like to make it a meme title.

1597
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,500
When you want that

1598
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,500
pregnancy ASMR

1599
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,500
you can't just say that.

1600
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,500
Yeah I would love that.

1601
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,500
Consider it on my to-do list then

1602
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,500
because that's like super easy to make

1603
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,500
ASMR wise.

1604
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,500
Literally put the microphone

1605
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,500
on my stomach

1606
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,500
and be silent for 15 minutes

1607
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,500
and then apply

1608
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,500
a noise gate filter

1609
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,500
and then that's it.

1610
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,500
We're done.

1611
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,500
Giant ASMR when?

1612
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:07,500
I do have one.

1613
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,500
Azura has one.

1614
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,500
I'm going to make Emmy do one

1615
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,500
because I want her book to go terribly wrong.

1616
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,500
I'll make a plot where she's tired

1617
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,500
being the smallest of the allure

1618
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,500
and then ends up becoming a giant

1619
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,500
for like 24 hours.

1620
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,500
When would that be uploaded?

1621
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,500
I want to say soon DM.

1622
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,500
Maybe within the month?

1623
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,500
I'll try my best.

1624
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,500
Strongly goes crack and mood.

1625
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,500
Laying on girlfriend's stomach while

1626
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,500
she's waiting for her Door Dash order.

1627
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,500
That's actually really good.

1628
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,500
I might steal that. I'm not being funny.

1629
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,500
I might actually just straight up steal your idea.

1630
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,500
Thank you for that.

1631
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,500
No way. I love you for that.

1632
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,500
Strongly you're the best.

1633
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,500
Wait for the giant ASMR

1634
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,500
stomach.

1635
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,500
Honestly,

1636
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,500
I am always like

1637
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,500
super happy to make you guys

1638
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,500
happy and I always

1639
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,500
want your ideas to be

1640
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,500
our ideas communism.

1641
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,500
That Door Dasher

1642
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,500
me, literally.

1643
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,500
She has

1644
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,500
the spell to make everything

1645
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,500
bigger but instead turns

1646
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,500
herself into a giantess.

1647
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,500
I know

1648
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,500
so this is

1649
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,500
a little fun fact

1650
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,500
about me.

1651
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,500
I actually really enjoy

1652
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,500
giantism

1653
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:37,500
which is why

1654
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,500
Azura can

1655
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,500
become a giant

1656
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,500
but she can only be as tall

1657
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,500
as a skyscraper. She can't be

1658
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,500
indefinitely big

1659
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,500
but she is a god at the end

1660
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,500
of the day

1661
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,500
but because she gave up some of her

1662
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,500
divinity she has

1663
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,500
a regular human height of 185 cm.

1664
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,500
I wasn't kidding when I

1665
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,500
said the girls were based after my

1666
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,500
kinks. I don't care what anyone

1667
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,500
says is true.

1668
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,500
But yes, I

1669
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,500
tiny shrunken chat.

1670
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,500
I wanted to do swallowing

1671
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,500
ASMR as well

1672
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,500
where I get so hungry

1673
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
little reefling and you look like calamari

1674
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,500
and I swallow you

1675
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,500
and you're in my tummy and I'm like

1676
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,500
talking to you whilst you're getting

1677
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,500
digested by me.

1678
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,500
Yeah, I just like

1679
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,500
these kind of things. I'm sorry.

1680
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,500
No, please don't

1681
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,500
eat us.

1682
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,500
I just

1683
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,500
like these things. I find them so

1684
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,500
creative. I really do.

1685
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,500
Well, I'm proud to be here

1686
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,500
dinner.

1687
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,500
I hope I'm

1688
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,500
scared. Only

1689
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,500
eat us in this other content.

1690
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,500
Wait, I'm on the fence

1691
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,500
about being eaten. We'll see

1692
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,500
what you think after the audio comes out.

1693
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,500
Maybe you'll like it. Maybe you won't.

1694
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,500
As always,

1695
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,500
don't subject

1696
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,500
your tentacle

1697
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,500
to something you know you don't like.

1698
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,500
When is your

1699
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,500
ink rating stream?

1700
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,500
Probably next

1701
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,500
week. It will be my membership

1702
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,500
stream.

1703
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,500
Where we rate everything

1704
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,500
and I get to be as unhinged

1705
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,500
as I desire.

1706
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,500
I'm going to be speaking about all

1707
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,500
the scenarios

1708
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,500
I want to be doing on you.

1709
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,500
I'm not holding back.

1710
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,500
I mean being eaten by you is on the

1711
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,500
table since debut. I assure you

1712
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,500
I'm very nutritious.

1713
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,500
Wow, my stomach

1714
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,500
really is making my system.

1715
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,500
Always giving a try to

1716
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,500
audios you don't know if you like or not.

1717
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,500
Yeah, some people

1718
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,500
that didn't think they were going to enjoy the

1719
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,500
Patreon.

1720
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,500
Tell me, are you okay?

1721
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,500
Some people

1722
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,500
thought they didn't.

1723
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,500
They weren't going to enjoy

1724
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,500
my alternative

1725
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,500
audio of a unique variation.

1726
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,500
And they really enjoyed it.

1727
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,500
Which I'm glad. It was

1728
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,500
a fun challenge.

1729
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,500
I enjoyed it very much.

1730
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,500
There's literally no word that can come

1731
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,500
out of your mouth. I don't love hearing

1732
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,500
and inking for.

1733
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,500
Go get food.

1734
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,500
I'm redirecting

1735
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,500
very shortly. I'll get food then.

1736
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,500
I like being with you.

1737
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,500
I don't want to get distracted.

1738
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,500
Go get food.

1739
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,500
If you're going to eat me,

1740
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,500
at least give me a good time.

1741
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,500
Maybe

1742
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,500
I'll pretend that you're getting digested

1743
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,500
but I'll just foam it you up again.

1744
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,500
The Bully

1745
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,500
Patreon.

1746
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,500
What from any

1747
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,500
love being with your dad?

1748
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,500
Thank you.

1749
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,500
Or do you mean the party one

1750
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,500
where the P

1751
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,500
picks on you at a party?

1752
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,500
I think she be had some

1753
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,500
problems today.

1754
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,500
Why?

1755
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,500
Problems with what?

1756
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,500
I'm turned

1757
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,500
for trying most

1758
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,500
tags except for

1759
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:43,500
text

1760
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,500
because it just makes me sad. Oh, I'm sorry

1761
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,500
to hear that.

1762
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,500
Out of the audios,

1763
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,500
their audios are so fun.

1764
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,500
There's one ASMR that makes a bunch

1765
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,500
of audios with listener

1766
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,500
perishes.

1767
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,500
Is that Macabre? I know exactly

1768
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,500
who you're talking about, Macabre.

1769
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,500
Oh no, I think they changed their name.

1770
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,500
Sugar. I can't remember what their

1771
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,500
new name is. Your voice gets

1772
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,500
me distracted. Good.

1773
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,500
It should.

1774
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,500
Chubby weekend

1775
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,500
tags are my favourite.

1776
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,500
I have terrible news. Patreon

1777
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,500
banner.

1778
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,500
I can probably do something on

1779
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,500
Twitter with that.

1780
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,500
But Patreon banner.

1781
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,500
Instead of one, you could just

1782
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,500
put...

1783
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,500
I can bill you.

1784
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,500
Once you've had your time in the

1785
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
tummy time, the demo

1786
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,500
one was so good.

1787
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,500
It was my first ever freaking

1788
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,500
audio, and I was like so

1789
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,500
nervous to do it.

1790
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,500
Oh yes, do you like that?

1791
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,500
Oh, I bet you do.

1792
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,500
I enjoy it.

1793
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,500
Come to bed with me.

1794
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:05,500
It wasn't so nerve-wracking.

1795
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,500
I was like, no one is going to

1796
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:09,500
enjoy this, but I'm so glad you

1797
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,500
enjoy it.

1798
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,500
I don't know if I like the voice

1799
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,500
or the attitude. I like to hear

1800
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,500
what makes it...

1801
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,500
I thought there's a cat here

1802
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,500
in my mouth.

1803
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,500
There's a freaking cat here.

1804
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,500
Kimly.

1805
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:31,500
Kimly, your freaking cat here went

1806
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,500
in my mouth.

1807
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,500
All your Patreon content is good.

1808
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,500
Thank you.

1809
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,500
I can't remember what the next

1810
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,500
plot being uploaded is.

1811
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,500
Yeah, Patreon

1812
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,500
literally said

1813
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,500
feedurism ban. Well, no.

1814
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,500
MasterCard just said it's ban

1815
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,500
because it's like dangerous or whatever.

1816
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,500
That cat here

1817
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:55,500
literally me.

1818
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,500
You're in my mouth.

1819
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,500
Do you hypnotize yourself? No, I can.

1820
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,500
But

1821
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,500
lore-wise,

1822
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,500
mirrors are my

1823
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,500
biggest weakness.

1824
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,500
And when I do my tonathon,

1825
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,500
you guys are going to be sick of those

1826
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,500
laws. I freaking

1827
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,500
love ton laws so much.

1828
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:17,500
I don't care what anyone says.

1829
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,500
It's so good.

1830
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,500
Like, please

1831
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,500
parade me around like a pup.

1832
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,500
Credit card companies need to

1833
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,500
stop. Yes,

1834
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,500
it's crazy.

1835
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,500
I mean, they literally run the world

1836
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:35,500
whilst they're banning

1837
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,500
all this stuff and they're all jumping on

1838
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,500
Epstein Island. Like, you literally

1839
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,500
can't make this stuff up.

1840
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,500
They ban feedurism,

1841
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:45,500
but they're all chilling on Epstein Island.

1842
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,500
Prove.

1843
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:49,500
Get a fucking grip. Honestly, this is when

1844
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,500
I don't look in the rabbit hole. You'll go too deep.

1845
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,500
Well, time to get a mirror.

1846
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,500
Are you afraid of mirrors?

1847
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,500
It's because

1848
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,500
if I look into a mirror

1849
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,500
like this, I can hypnotize

1850
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,500
myself because I fall

1851
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,500
for the spiral.

1852
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,500
Okay, so I can't look

1853
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,500
at mirrors while I'm trying to hypnotize

1854
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,500
you or else I'm in

1855
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,500
trouble.

1856
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,500
Don't lose as long as it's

1857
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,500
huge.

1858
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,500
Morning, good morning.

1859
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,500
I want

1860
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:23,500
Astronic conspiracy theory stream.

1861
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,500
You asked, I will deliver.

1862
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,500
Oh my god.

1863
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,500
Like, I know I keep mentioning needy streamer

1864
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:31,500
overload. I was so surprised

1865
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,500
that they had that kind

1866
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,500
of thing because I was like, wait a minute.

1867
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,500
I'm interested

1868
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,500
in this stuff, but

1869
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,500
I'm aware it may filter a lot of people.

1870
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,500
But

1871
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,500
then again,

1872
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,500
more intimate streams.

1873
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,500
I just made refling.

1874
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,500
I just made

1875
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,500
I'm just glad

1876
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,500
everyone is based. Yeah.

1877
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,500
We're probably like, we don't really judge

1878
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,500
anyone here. Just have a good time.

1879
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:05,500
All that jazz.

1880
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,500
Astronic conspiracy

1881
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,500
theory stream. Oh,

1882
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,500
that's going to take me hours to prepare

1883
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,500
my presentation.

1884
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,500
I'm going to come with a breath.

1885
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,500
I'm going to come with a receipt.

1886
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,500
I'm going to change your perspective on

1887
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,500
everything.

1888
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,500
They can't handle listening to the

1889
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,500
truth. I'm going to put a tin foil

1890
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,500
hat on myself and I will

1891
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,500
offer you all to wear a tin foil hat

1892
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,500
on stream too.

1893
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,500
Feeler is going for cultural victory.

1894
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,500
Exactly.

1895
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,500
Based. Oh, should you base it on?

1896
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,500
The stream is a perfect test for

1897
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:47,500
my new headphones. Oh, yeah.

1898
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,500
Can you hear me in this ear?

1899
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,500
What if I go into this ear?

1900
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,500
Does it sound like I am going

1901
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,500
ear to ear? It's kind of amazing

1902
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,500
technology, isn't it?

1903
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:59,500
Please. I'll let you gaslight me.

1904
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,500
Oh, please let me main break you.

1905
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,500
Please. Please for me.

1906
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,500
I'll be a good little girl.

1907
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,500
If you let me main break you.

1908
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:15,500
I had to dream the other night.

1909
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,500
I had to dream I had you in a

1910
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,500
standing position but I was lifting you.

1911
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,500
Your little legs were swaying

1912
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,500
as I was moving.

1913
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:25,500
A lot of painting

1914
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,500
and roughness of fall

1915
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,500
briefly. Oh my god.

1916
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:35,500
Great on head.

1917
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,500
Please. Song sure good girl.

1918
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:39,500
That's right. I'm a good girl.

1919
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,500
Keep playing with me. Be careful.

1920
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:47,500
Okay. Yeah. I'm a good friend.

1921
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,500
Please.

1922
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,500
Wow.

1923
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,500
Wow.

1924
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,500
Wow.

1925
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,500
Did our legs sway to improve?

1926
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:59,500
Did I am in love?

1927
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,500
An audio where you try and hypnotize

1928
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:05,500
Shibi but end up seeing a mirror

1929
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,500
and hypnotizing yourself and she

1930
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,500
takes advantage of the situation

1931
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,500
would be quite interesting.

1932
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,500
Is that a donathon public

1933
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,500
report?

1934
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,500
I think it is.

1935
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,500
Wait for a Zora to cook.

1936
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,500
Okay.

1937
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,500
I will be working one on one with a Zora

1938
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,500
to help her donathon wards

1939
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:31,500
and if it goes well

1940
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,500
I think a Zora can move out.

1941
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:35,500
And I'm so excited for her.

1942
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,500
Anyway now that you are so close I must say

1943
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,500
I like a lot of little green

1944
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,500
parts in my hair. Yeah.

1945
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,500
I have a few strands of green

1946
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,500
out but that's just because

1947
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,500
I can't keep it all away.

1948
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,500
I have such big hair.

1949
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,500
Could you please put the head

1950
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,500
and the eyes on? Sure.

1951
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,500
But it won't be.

1952
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,500
Hi Refle.

1953
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,500
It's me again.

1954
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,500
Just talking

1955
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,500
to your subconscious.

1956
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,500
Don't worry.

1957
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,500
I won't do anything.

1958
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,500
Not this day.

1959
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,500
But this is just a remainder.

1960
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,500
I own you.

1961
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,500
All of you.

1962
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,500
Your thoughts.

1963
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,500
Your mind.

1964
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,500
Just a remainder.

1965
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,500
My hair.

1966
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,500
Did I turn off the reverb?

1967
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,500
Is the reverb off?

1968
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,500
Did I turn it off?

1969
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,500
Or did I not hit the button?

1970
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,500
Yes it's off.

1971
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,500
Okay thank you.

1972
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,500
Indeed you do on me.

1973
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,500
Sounds off.

1974
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,500
Okay get the reverb wasn't on.

1975
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,500
Oh it never came on.

1976
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,500
It was supposed to come on.

1977
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,500
I guess I never hit the button hard enough.

1978
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,500
Reverb.

1979
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,500
Never turned on.

1980
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,500
This is a remainder.

1981
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,500
Wait is it broken?

1982
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,500
Oh I think it might be broken.

1983
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,500
Oops I broke it.

1984
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,500
Oops.

1985
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,500
It seems like I dropped my mirror face up.

1986
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:41,500
I hope you don't like that.

1987
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,500
Yes you won't be.

1988
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,500
It was never on.

1989
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,500
Do it again.

1990
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,500
It's broken. I don't know why it's not working.

1991
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,500
When you mentioned about A.C.

1992
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,500
using our boots to step on us

1993
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,500
and nearly triggered something in me.

1994
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:01,500
Also you trying to hit me

1995
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,500
was on a ship with the ships.

1996
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:05,500
The ships can't see or get into your bed

1997
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,500
causing people to get hypnotized by your reflection.

1998
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:09,500
That's so good.

1999
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,500
Wait what almost triggered you?

2000
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,500
A.C. sound?

2001
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,500
You almost got triggered?

2002
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,500
Are you really that badly minded?

2003
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:25,500
That something so sweet

2004
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,500
and innocent

2005
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,500
and feral like me

2006
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:31,500
could hurt you?

2007
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:33,500
Could hurt you?

2008
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,500
A.C. sound?

2009
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,500
And you'd like it.

2010
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,500
You're so dirty.

2011
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,500
I can't.

2012
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,500
I'm sorry A.C.

2013
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,500
I'm so sorry A.C.

2014
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,500
My role playing is my genie.

2015
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,500
Is that a thing that's weird?

2016
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:53,500
I don't know if I'm crossing a boundary.

2017
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:55,500
I should probably ask them.

2018
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:03,500
They're not the oos in chat over me.

2019
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,500
Surprise this is my actual voice.

2020
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,500
You're going to A.C.'s mimic.

2021
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,500
If my voice wasn't broken

2022
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,500
I wonder if I could smoothly do A.C.'s voice.

2023
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,500
Hi A.C.'s fans.

2024
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,500
Hi A.C.'s fans.

2025
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,500
I missed you.

2026
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:33,500
We are playing Tomb Raider today.

2027
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:35,500
I can hardly do it

2028
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:37,500
without causing the crack in my voice.

2029
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:39,500
That's very hard because she's higher pitched than me.

2030
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,500
We'll get them next time.

2031
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,500
That could be a fun idea.

2032
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,500
Everyone has to impersonate.

2033
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,500
Well I begs A.C. because she's the only one I can impersonate.

2034
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:55,500
With mailed success.

2035
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,500
I wonder if it's because she's European

2036
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,500
that I can mimic.

2037
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,500
That seems silly but at the same time

2038
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,500
she is the only voice.

2039
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:05,500
Your voice is already our favourite.

2040
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,500
We're very Sean Connery when it's deep.

2041
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,500
I can make my accent even stronger

2042
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,500
but I don't talk on stream like this

2043
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,500
because hardly anyone can understand

2044
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:21,500
what the heck I'm saying.

2045
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,500
Do you mean

2046
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,500
Sorry do you mean

2047
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,500
just having a big white square over the male's face

2048
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,500
with a nicotine patch on it?

2049
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,500
Maybe I understand.

2050
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,500
Or I'm just stupid.

2051
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,500
Sorry for that idea.

2052
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:41,500
I had a character with neat eyes and a mouse.

2053
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,500
If you go on my alternative twitter

2054
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,500
that are

2055
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,500
oh why am I

2056
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:53,500
I was not asleep.

2057
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,500
Papaparito drew

2058
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,500
a wiggling head on a man

2059
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,500
if you need a mountain eyes

2060
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,500
you can maybe do that.

2061
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,500
Uchi san's in danger.

2062
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,500
Going to get double teamed up by double A.C.

2063
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,500
It's normal for scholars

2064
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,500
using so many hours then.

2065
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:13,500
Yeah so

2066
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,500
you guys say girl

2067
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,500
but we say ghetto

2068
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,500
like good ghetto.

2069
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,500
Your last ASMR stream

2070
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,500
when you kissed at the end I felt it.

2071
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,500
Larry

2072
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,500
Thank you for feeling that.

2073
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:41,500
A.C. and Junior collab

2074
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:43,500
for Double Eastern European would go hard.

2075
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,500
Honestly yeah

2076
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,500
I'm done for the slavic.

2077
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,500
Thank you so much for the tip.

2078
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,500
I appreciate it.

2079
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,500
And I'm glad you could feel it in your tip.

2080
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,500
Howdy scrawny

2081
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,500
I just wanted to share how much I've been loving

2082
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,500
you and your content

2083
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:07,500
and the grilles.

2084
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:09,500
I wish I could share more of my love with your doors

2085
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,500
but feel her mom

2086
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,500
has got it going on.

2087
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,500
All of our doors have been streamed

2088
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:17,500
so long.

2089
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,500
Reflings can you see

2090
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,500
I might not be the oshi for you

2091
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,500
wait

2092
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:25,500
can you see there's an oshi

2093
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,500
what the f- I can't pick a song up

2094
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:29,500
you're literally too perfect

2095
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,500
in the fact that I can make you happy

2096
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,500
by making your doors happy is even fair.

2097
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,500
Yeah

2098
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,500
I was curious about your preferences

2099
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,500
in Pippu's

2100
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,500
I had to thought about a video

2101
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,500
but then I wasn't sure if the visuals

2102
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:45,500
managed as much as I would make

2103
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,500
so I was wondering oh audio's work

2104
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:49,500
yes they work audio works

2105
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:51,500
very well yes please

2106
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,500
Anyway I look forward to

2107
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,500
all your content. Thank you

2108
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,500
and everything else you do in my heart

2109
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:01,500
makes very much. I want to

2110
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,500
love you and help the girls succeed. Thank you so much

2111
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:05,500
I appreciate that I love you to

2112
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,500
replay. Thank you for such a great message

2113
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,500
sorry if I said twice

2114
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,500
tomorrow is tricky it is tricky

2115
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:13,500
she be reminder

2116
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,500
oh I'm actually calling

2117
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,500
in a favor for a friend

2118
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:19,500
we're gonna redirect

2119
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,500
actually militia

2120
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,500
she make me live right now

2121
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:25,500
we're calling in a favor for a friend

2122
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,500
okay an old friend

2123
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:31,500
we are going to redirect

2124
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,500
into mimosa

2125
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:35,500
because mimosa

2126
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:37,500
is letting me steal her voice

2127
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,500
for an ASMR collab

2128
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:43,500
I believe she is live with ASMR

2129
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:45,500
right now she is okay we're calling

2130
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,500
in a friend

2131
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,500
a favor for a friend

2132
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,500
mimosa is agreed to do

2133
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:53,500
an ASMR collab with me

2134
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:55,500
she's gonna redirect back into

2135
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,500
another violer girl

2136
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:59,500
so please don't worry please

2137
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:01,500
enjoy mimosa

2138
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,500
this is called team building

2139
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:05,500
team exercising

2140
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,500
she's been very open to me

2141
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:09,500
even though I'm a dirty dirty

2142
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,500
and she's been very kind to consider

2143
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,500
it so

2144
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:15,500
please do

2145
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:19,500
why does it not let me redirect

2146
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,500
into her

2147
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:23,500
mimosa a cue me pause

2148
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,500
yes sorry for such a short ASMR stream

2149
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,500
sadly my voice breaks

2150
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,500
too easily

2151
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:31,500

01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,500

2159
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:51,500

2160
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:53,500

2161
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:55,500
with a Vtuber audio like literally

01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:57,500
