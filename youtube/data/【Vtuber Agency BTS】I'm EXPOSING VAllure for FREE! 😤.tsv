30000	32000	Yeah, A.C. finish up.
32000	33000	Good A.C.
33000	34000	She wasn't supposed to do that shit.
34000	35000	There you go.
35000	38000	Ah, I'm a fucking talk of the word.
38000	40000	I can hear myself.
40000	42000	Mike, can I hear myself?
42000	43000	Please.
43000	44000	Okay, okay, okay.
44000	45000	Right.
45000	46000	Ugh.
46000	48000	How did A.C. do in her 2.0?
48000	50000	She was adorable, right?
50000	52000	She was freaking amazing.
52000	57000	I turned down my music this time because during debut it was unbelievably loud and I didn't
57000	58000	catch it.
58000	59000	Like a dumbass.
59000	60000	But hey ho.
60000	61000	Right.
61000	64000	I'm going to do two streams.
64000	67000	This stream is dedicated to exposing VLR.
67000	68000	The YouTube agency.
68000	69000	The YouTube agency.
69000	71000	That VTuber agency, okay?
71000	73000	Now, I'm very unprofessional.
73000	75000	I'm very scatterbrained.
75000	77000	I'm very XYZ, you know.
77000	83000	So, I am going to try my best to stick to a one hour of just exposing the agency.
83000	85000	I will talk.
85000	88000	I will take questions at the end.
88000	89000	I can see chat.
89000	90000	I can read chat.
90000	91000	I can interact with you.
91000	94000	During debut, you're not really supposed to interact that much.
94000	98000	But I can 100% completely tune in on your forehead and all that.
98000	99000	So, don't worry.
99000	100000	Don't worry.
100000	101000	It will be three hours long.
101000	102000	Bruh.
102000	103000	No, she be.
103000	104000	I'm trying to read, isn't it?
104000	105000	Yeah.
105000	106000	That's why I'm like, right.
106000	108000	One hour for this and then one hour for my thing.
108000	109000	Right.
109000	110000	Okay.
110000	111000	Okay.
111000	112000	What's a Z?
112000	114000	Is that a rune in the, what?
114000	115000	What?
115000	118000	Don't be trolling with my accent already.
118000	119000	Right, right, right.
119000	121000	One, one, one, one, one.
121000	124000	Let's begin at the very start.
124000	129000	And by start, I mean whatever I could gather notes on very quickly.
129000	130000	Right.
130000	132000	Well, we start with the application.
132000	133000	Sorry.
133000	134000	I'm rubbing my eyeball.
134000	137000	Currently got a fricking rogue eyelash in it.
137000	139000	I'm jumping straight into it.
139000	140000	I'm not stalling.
140000	141000	Okay.
141000	144000	And this is at the wrong part.
144000	145000	Okay.
145000	147000	I'm talking about the applications first.
147000	148000	Hold on.
148000	150000	Let me just, okay.
150000	151000	Good.
151000	152000	Okay.
152000	154000	That's not the starting one.
154000	155000	Okay.
155000	156000	This is the starting one.
156000	161000	So, on the VLR website, you will notice there was a few things slightly different than
161000	164000	what the average VTuber agency asks for.
164000	165000	Okay.
165000	168000	Most VTuber agencies go, hey, we don't care what gender you are.
168000	173000	Thanks to entertainment laws, I could say whamen only.
173000	174000	Sorry, guys.
174000	177000	But you want to start a male VTuber agency?
177000	178000	Absolutely.
178000	179000	Nothing's holding you back.
179000	181000	I assure you.
181000	184000	However, me, I'm looking for fannies to join.
184000	185000	Okay.
185000	186000	You know what?
186000	190000	But we also had more requirements as well.
190000	191000	Okay.
191000	197000	Those requirements were you had to have experience being a naughty, naughty.
197000	199000	Doesn't matter what kind.
199000	202000	As long as you had some sort of variation, you're going to be comfortable with it.
202000	207000	So, just think about the application pool and how it gets lower and lower.
207000	216000	And most VTuber agencies, for whatever reason, lie to your face and go, you can apply even
216000	219000	if you don't have any experience.
219000	220000	Liars.
220000	222000	They are wasting your time.
222000	228000	Do not believe them and do not apply to agencies that say that you do not have to be a content
228000	231000	creator prior to applying for them.
231000	233000	You're wasting your time.
233000	236000	They are wasting your time and they do not deserve.
236000	237000	You don't deserve that.
237000	239000	Seriously, you don't deserve that.
239000	241000	It's such a freaking waste, okay?
241000	246000	And the Veiler website had a redonkulous amount of information on it or they knew the split
246000	250000	off the bat or they knew what was happening with merchandise sales off the bat.
250000	257000	They are at freaking, put my soul into making that website as clear as possible.
257000	259000	Okay?
259000	261000	So, no time wasters.
261000	264000	Give or take, we had 320 applications.
264000	265000	Lovely girls.
265000	268000	However, that meant for every one model.
268000	270000	I was a preselected talent if you didn't know.
270000	273000	Hi, I was inks, codename inks.
274000	275000	Yeah.
275000	284000	So, for every one model, we had 34 girls essentially battling it out to be the right fit.
284000	285000	And it was not easy.
285000	286000	Okay, it was not easy.
286000	288000	She put that whole straw noose in our website.
288000	290000	Wait, that's inks?
290000	292000	I shut up.
292000	294000	Right.
294000	301000	For the most popular picked character, design wise,
301000	303000	what was she be?
303000	304000	Don't be fooled by that color.
304000	305000	That's not pins.
305000	307000	That's a light blue for any.
307000	308000	Okay?
308000	310000	So, the majority said put me on anyone.
310000	311000	Put me where you fit.
311000	312000	You want to fit me.
312000	313000	Okay?
313000	316000	So, ropes was the most picked.
316000	317000	It ropes.
317000	319000	She be was the most picked.
319000	322000	And then I see was the second.
322000	324000	And then Azura was the third.
324000	326000	And then Mercy was the second.
326000	328000	And then the very last picked.
328000	330000	Oh dear, if they didn't like your silhouette.
330000	332000	I'm like, are you kidding me?
332000	333000	I'm sorry.
333000	336000	I love creepy little girl designs.
336000	338000	I'm just going to leave it at that.
338000	339000	I love little creepy things.
339000	341000	It's a fucking gorgeous design.
341000	342000	I don't care what anyone said.
342000	344000	No one wanted to be me.
344000	346000	Shonton behavior.
346000	347000	Shonton.
347000	354000	And then obviously I cannot show the fricking private information of those who applied.
354000	359000	So, I can just show you these fun pie charts about the application process.
359000	364000	So, people say the reason why Veeler asked if your PC was weak,
364000	368000	because we have the funds to purchase an entire new PC for you,
368000	370000	which we did for one talent.
370000	375000	So, enjoy that, the new PC hen.
375000	379000	But yeah, we had the funds to completely give you the equipment you needed.
379000	383000	They all got three deals that they can use for ASMR streams.
383000	387000	They'll let SMBs for streaming if they didn't have it.
387000	392000	So, we also gave a sign-on bonus as well,
392000	398000	because we had two months to kind of prepare for the debuts and all that.
398000	405000	And it's quite a lot to ask someone to, you know, kind of give your full focus,
405000	408000	if you will, to a new agency where there's not an income source.
408000	414000	So, all the girls also got a sign-on bonus of 420 US dollars,
414000	416000	but I don't think any agency has done before.
416000	420000	And literally, it's like the most basic common courtesy.
420000	423000	Like, seriously. Like, I guess.
427000	431000	Seriously, Veeler, it's planning to get any money, because it sounds like it is...
431000	435000	Oh, well, we'll talk about the profits a little bit.
435000	441000	I also, in the application form, you could tell us if you wanted to have a callback,
441000	447000	if we find you might be suitable for a later character if we were to expand.
447000	450000	Now, I'm going to say this publicly right now.
450000	453000	No one has been contacted for a callback.
453000	464000	The reason for that is because it's a bit of a cheek to have someone basically wait for a year
464000	467000	for a non-guaranteed slot in an agency.
467000	472000	And I didn't want anyone hanging about maybe pausing plans they have,
472000	475000	like, because some people might want to, you know, get a 2.0 model,
475000	480000	some people want to maybe start up as a new VTuber, like, type thing with a new persona.
480000	483000	Like, I just didn't want anyone to be at that stage.
483000	489000	So, I'll just say publicly now, no one has been contacted for a thingy.
489000	491000	But yes.
491000	493000	Okay, so that was kind of the application process.
494000	495000	The interview process.
495000	500000	I'm more than happy for the girls to talk about the interview process with me.
500000	504000	Basically, if you're interested in Veeler, I was the barrier, okay?
504000	508000	I was the one reviewing you and looking at your content, if you applied,
508000	511000	and I was like you and you, you know.
511000	514000	It's a bit awkward.
514000	517000	I'll say this part out loud.
517000	521000	It was a bit morally, hmm,
521000	528000	because I was judging VTubers that had way more streaming experience than me
528000	531000	to be like, oh, you're worthy to come in or not.
531000	534000	And it's like, hmm, it wasn't a nice feeling.
534000	538000	Kind of like being like, no, but you can't want me.
538000	542000	Right, okay, questions.
542000	545000	Most basic, why are you called Veeler?
545000	549000	Now, check out the V at the start, virtual,
549000	552000	as most agencies start with a V for virtual, okay?
552000	554000	And then the A.
554000	558000	Okay, now put V and A together, okay?
558000	559000	What do you get?
559000	563000	You get voice acting, hmm, voice acting, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
563000	568000	Okay, and the girls are doing amateur voice acting audios.
568000	571000	Oh my God, oh my God, you did it.
571000	572000	You did it.
572000	574000	You put it together too.
574000	576000	Also, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
576000	577000	Let's read it together.
577000	578000	Let's read it together.
578000	581000	V, okay, and then imagine if there was an imaginary dash.
581000	586000	Allure, allure, as if the girls were alluring.
586000	589000	Oh my, oh my God.
589000	590000	Put it together.
590000	591000	We've done it, lads.
591000	593000	We've cracked the fucking case.
593000	595000	Okay, that's why it's called failure.
595000	598000	There's no other thing to it, okay?
598000	602000	I thought it was pretty self-explanatory,
602000	604000	but it wasn't, okay?
604000	605000	It wasn't.
605000	608000	I was like, V, allure, okay?
608000	609000	V, allure.
609000	611000	But we've got so many different pronunciations.
611000	614000	I think if you have an American, you're like, V, allure.
614000	618000	And it's like, I never really thought about other accents saying it
618000	621000	because I was like, hmm, one accent, but here you go.
621000	624000	Anya, questions?
624000	626000	Why are you called Viller?
626000	628000	How hand on are you with the talents?
628000	631000	The talents can do whatever the fuck they want.
631000	633000	They do not come to me for permission.
633000	635000	They don't have to come to me.
635000	636000	Shawnee, I want to do this.
636000	637000	I want to do it.
637000	640000	The only thing they come to me with is they go,
640000	641000	I want a project.
641000	642000	I want this.
642000	643000	I want that.
643000	644000	I want this asset.
644000	646000	Then they come to me and I sugar mummy them.
646000	648000	And I'll be like, there you go, darlin'.
648000	650000	Allure's 10, pop your pop.
650000	651000	The girls do what they want.
651000	655000	They do not need permission for in real life hand-to-cam streams,
655000	656000	for example.
656000	657000	None of that shit.
657000	659000	You guys have to understand,
659000	661000	we're all adults here.
661000	665000	I am not going to treat anyone like they're a fucking child
665000	669000	and they need permission from me to work.
669000	670000	Okay?
670000	672000	Because as it stands, they're, you know,
672000	674000	doing work and streaming and all that,
674000	678000	you do not need permission to work.
678000	679000	Okay?
679000	682000	So we don't do none of that shit around here.
682000	687000	One of the funniest comments I had seen so far
687000	691000	was, uh, management's going to run away with the money, aren't we?
691000	694000	Oh, you've caught me.
694000	695000	You've caught me.
695000	699000	Was the 80-20 split showing my corporation greed?
699000	705000	Was the 100% merch sales to the talent showing my corporation greed?
705000	706000	Oh no!
706000	710000	Oh, my plans have been foiled.
710000	716000	You've seen right through my plans to steal from these girls.
716000	717000	Mate.
717000	718000	Mate.
718000	719000	Mate.
719000	724000	You have no concept of how much love has gone into this.
724000	726000	You have no concept.
726000	728000	But thank you for your comment.
728000	733000	The entire development team had a nice chuckle at you, mate.
733000	736000	That was some basic questions, okay?
736000	738000	Now, the accusations.
738000	740000	I'm sorry.
740000	743000	The accusations, I can't outrun them.
743000	745000	It's time.
745000	748000	I can't believe I'm saying this.
748000	753000	But it's true.
753000	757000	The background music's are based on Sonic Heroes' OST.
757000	759000	I'm sorry.
759000	761000	It was the autism, your honor.
761000	763000	I couldn't stop it.
763000	769000	Okay, I'm sorry, but Mercy's background music is based after
769000	773000	Billet Station from Sonic Heroes' OST.
773000	776000	MAP's is after Mystic Mansion.
776000	780000	I'm so sorry.
780000	783000	Azura's is after Frog Forest.
783000	786000	I'm sorry.
786000	794000	And Shavey's, it's after Strange Guys and AC and Casino Park.
794000	796000	And then me, Bingo Highway.
796000	800000	Because, you know, Bingo Highway has a little bit of ear to ear.
800000	802000	And then it also has it in my background music.
802000	805000	You can really hear it in Emmys and Mercy's, for example.
805000	807000	Okay, it's true.
807000	808000	It's true.
808000	810000	I brought to them that your honor.
810000	811000	Yes.
811000	814000	Well, you started VTuber Agency and then you made the background music
814000	817000	based after an old game called Sonic Heroes' OST.
817000	818000	Yeah, I did.
818000	819000	What are you going to do about it, huh?
819000	820000	Are you going to fart?
820000	823000	Are you going to fart and sniff it or something?
823000	825000	Right, these are spoilers.
825000	827000	Spoilers up ahead.
827000	828000	Spoilers.
828000	829000	Okay.
829000	832000	These are badges and emote spoilers.
832000	836000	Now, because of the way the agency is set,
836000	839000	so the girls couldn't pick their emotes at the stage,
839000	841000	so I got them emotes.
841000	843000	I just guessed what emotes they'd like.
843000	845000	So some big spoilers for emotes ahead.
845000	848000	If you don't want to know what the emotes are for when their membership open,

1085000	1086000	Yes.
1086000	1087000	Yes.
1087000	1088000	Yes.
1088000	1089000	Yes.
1089000	1090000	Her.

1095000	1096000	Yes.
1096000	1097000	Yes.
1097000	1098000	Yes.
1098000	1100000	Ah
1110440	1112440	We still got a few more go
1128000	1130000	I
1151800	1154020	Don't know how to make the sound of a blade swing
1158000	1160000	Oh
1179840	1181840	Last one
1182280	1185960	Did you like it? Oh, when I lose track and my hypnosis comes on
1188120	1190120	Do you like that? Yeah, I was good
1191120	1195440	Okay, a little spoiler in the most as I said the girls get to pick their emotes
1196040	1200920	After this next batch because obviously I had to order it in of the rounds because I didn't know them yet
1203120	1208480	Lore okay, so this is this is super behind-the-scenes stuff. So again squishy girl
1210040	1216800	Conceptualize the lore so this is what an example of a lore storyboard looks like I'm giving you the hints
1216800	1218800	So this is a zero for example
1218960	1225760	So as you can see at the script right away the earth was driven L baron in its infancy then from dust to darkness was the first family
1225760	1231160	So this is called concept art for the lore that was given to T Tema Chi Tema Chi
1231160	1233960	I would say T Matt T, but that's my accent
1234760	1240840	So that was this is these they're kind of it gives an idea of Tamachi of what she
1241560	1242840	Chant
1242840	1245840	Chant
1245840	1248680	Let's go squishy girls and chap, but you know, he's
1251800	1256800	So I'll give you a very quick example of what half wait hold on hold on hold on
1256800	1258800	Let me click let me click let me click let me click
1260240	1264400	So to give you a very quick example, I can only do it for my lore
1265400	1271080	But here are the first three concept panels so ghoul did the concept panels along with the script
1271120	1277440	So concept one two and three and then to match you saw it and then come oh shit
1277840	1283620	It's a bit big. Oh down a minute. Hold on. Hold on. It's very scuffed
1287720	1291800	So to match he comes back with the sketch and you know
1292760	1294760	It's so literally we go from
1295320	1300640	Well the top corner one to to the sketch so she comes back with a sketch absolutely beautiful garden
1302160	1310000	Beautiful beautiful and she then with the approval of the storyboard and sketch then the full images come through
1310000	1316720	And these come through all layered these are all there the reason why we could get the little images to move about was
1317040	1323880	To match he just works so diligently so hard. They were an absolute pleasure to work with I cannot recommend to match
1323880	1325880	She enough for like
1326680	1331760	You know, I gave her a lot of work. I could I could you know, I was insane work
1331760	1335760	But as you can see from the finished result of the lures to matchy
1339880	1345880	And beautiful that I look five star meal all the Michelin stars or however
1346800	1348800	Michelin stars work
1349200	1355520	But yes, so that's the behind-the-scenes of kind of the development of the lore so again squishy girl
1356000	1358520	Not only did he do the storyboard?
1358520	1361520	He also did the scripts in the background lures of the girls
1361520	1365160	I will come back to the development of the girls very shortly
1366200	1373600	And if you didn't know the merches are now out for the girls, but again in order to help artists it's so
1374440	1377760	To make things such a smooth process behind the scene and
1379760	1384240	Having a concept artist to give the actual artists
1385000	1391760	An idea of what you want helps so I hope I'm not spoiling the merch that's coming out, but this is a Zura
1393520	1400440	Little aces cons these are concepts of the merchandise that you see on who we mark it right now. I'll talk about it now and
1401440	1405000	Then a little mersey and she be and
1405920	1409680	Yeah, again, these are just concepts a beautiful behind-the-scenes stuff
1409680	1414240	It's really nice getting a thingy a little thingy so early development
1414240	1419200	Okay, now now you're gonna start cringing at a few of the things that come up shortly, but
1423800	1427400	Mmm, please please read please read
1428320	1430320	Thank you for reading
1430440	1434760	If we need to hire talent managers, we will open a position
1434760	1442760	I am so thankful for everyone applying, but for God's sake some of you are glowing for grooming the girls
1442760	1447000	I kid you not. I've had some emails that are like
1447720	1449480	Hi
1449480	1451480	I want to be a talent manager
1451640	1458080	No portfolio, no history, no evidence of anything, like no communication
1458080	1463640	I'm so thankful you want to work for the girls. I'm so thankful you want to groom them because you like them that much
1464200	1470400	My guy this agency we groom you. Full stop. That's the sense. Okay, so nice try
1470400	1476160	But if I need talent managers, I'll post on the website for the jobs that we need
1476680	1484680	Right, okay, this is where the cringe comes in. This is where the really the developmental cringe comes in, okay
1486280	1490680	So I'm gonna read it out to you. Don't worry if you can't read neither can I but I'll try my best to read it out
1493000	1500440	So when it comes to concepts, okay, as you'll notice these girls don't have names because
1501360	1503800	Because the girls started without names. That's how it was
1504240	1510040	So for the lore for girl one, it was it was the best we got to hang out together
1510040	1512720	We ordered food and watch anime all snuggled up
1512720	1514840	I couldn't have asked for anything more that night
1514840	1520800	It was a shame that the truth never came out that I could never tell my redacted that I love him before it was too late
1520800	1526000	It's not fair now. I'm some what I know I'm somewhere. Don't recognize and I'll never see him again
1526000	1528280	You'll still watch over me from where you are now, though
1529040	1534480	Hmm wonder wonder who that is. Um, but these are kind of description lores very quick
1536120	1538120	girl lore 2
1540440	1544680	When there's no one around to spoil what am I gonna do with myself?
1544680	1549680	I've got no purpose if I don't have a sweet heart to show my love, okay
1550320	1555440	That was I was a Zura that was a Zura that's where she started from see
1556200	1560600	Asura was given more of a kind of servant goddess role, but that definitely didn't really come into play
1562320	1565360	Mersey oh then pie. I know you're around here
1565360	1571840	You're playing a game with me aren't you thinking you can take me to an unfamiliar surrounding so I'd stop use flash, baby
1571840	1578280	I love you far too much to ever give up the chase. Isn't it fun when your heart is practically beating out of your chest?
1578800	1581720	Manic I do manic laughter, but Mersey absolutely fucking
1583680	1590360	She mugs me with her laugh. Oh wait, you're not Senpai, but you could be from the ones of you know, if you don't know mercy kind of
1591960	1593960	You know, you know how it goes
1594760	1596360	for
1596360	1598360	for
1599320	1603320	For okay for I have
1604160	1607640	You're gonna find out why four is so confusing four is icy
1608520	1612680	I quit whoever made this game who even made this game and read that wrong
1612680	1614440	Whoever even made this game in the first place
1614440	1620760	What's the point and putting achievements in a game if only 0.2% of the player base can even achieve it screw this
1620760	1622760	I'm going on a really
1623160	1628360	Website, okay. Now. What's the category tonight? Oh, let's do a random rule at our discord, okay?
1630200	1636600	As you can see aces come a very long way, okay, that's not aces lore at all. That's not our concept
1636600	1638600	We're not even there. Okay
1638680	1645320	Lore 5 I cannot for the life of me understand how guys work. How do their brains even function?
1645720	1648200	If only there was some sort of way
1649240	1651880	I could get them to be truthful with me
1653880	1655880	Um and
1656680	1662520	Yeah, so I always started with a hypno theme. Obviously I got to pick what the fuck I want to be because I was there from the start
1663080	1667000	I was always going to have hypno. I just didn't know what angle we were going for
1667720	1668920	and then
1668920	1675080	I got conceptualized to wanting to kill all humanity. So yeah, I didn't do that part by the way before you're like, oh my god
1676040	1678040	now
1678600	1681560	Sorry, I'm rubbing my face heat and then six. Um
1684600	1690200	Six, uh, it should be yeah, um, I've had it bunny boys are pathetic. They can never keep up with me
1690280	1693240	And I don't know why I bother wasting my time. I just need something different
1693560	1699000	Human males surely can keep up with this stamina of my needs type thing. Okay, so that's how the girls started
1699080	1701080	Okay, they all started deeply departed
1703000	1709480	So that's it. All right. Okay. This is a really fun. This is I hated naming everyone. I hate that
1709560	1716440	I hate that the the reason why you don't see me be zoo right now is because me be zoo was named correctly
1717000	1723320	Azura, you were a nightmare to name. Oh my god. I went through so many names
1723720	1726360	I literally came up with stacey milkerton
1726920	1730360	Azura, you were so hard to name for no reason
1730680	1739640	You can literally see how desperate I was getting through your name. I was like stacey milkerton. Miss milkerton milk the pillow show
1740040	1742040	Show me darling in french
1742440	1744440	Yeah, right. She's a goat god
1744840	1751320	Faunus in this milfu in this milf shoe milf is in milf for you
1751960	1754680	Fondue la fondue la bosom azura
1755240	1760440	Daily, which is the wrong spelling in french and then finally we got to azura delay. Oh
1761240	1765320	My god. Do you know do you see the techniques to fondue la bosom as well?
1765960	1767960	That's because I approved
1768120	1771480	That name for azura as fondue la bosom
1772280	1774280	What was I thinking?
1775320	1777320	Right
1777720	1781240	Okay, now this one's about this is a real behind the scenes lore
1782280	1785160	Mersey was originally stavita
1786520	1787640	Right
1787640	1788600	bread
1788600	1794360	What was I thinking and then if she was eastern european, we were going to change it to stavita
1795160	1798040	What was that smooton and then I
1798520	1803960	Approved the name karam beat so instead of karam bet as in sharp weapon
1804760	1806760	beat
1814040	1817800	So the fun fact is that it's not a fun fact. I'm such a dumb ass
1818920	1820920	Karam's name got past development
1822200	1826760	So mersey was called karam until about a month ago. It was awful
1829000	1833640	Don't let me cook ever again. I'm not naming anyone after this
1835000	1837000	right ac
1837320	1841000	ac is a lie. Do you want to know what ac's real name was?
1842600	1844600	Joy stick with an eye
1845320	1852680	ac was not developed as a polar bear. I'm going to show you her developmental are very shortly. Her name was joy stick
1853720	1855720	Yes, that's true
1856120	1860120	Now ac uh, umka is russian unbelievably
1860120	1865880	What are the odds because ac does speak russian but her concept did name was always ac we liked ac from the star
1865960	1867960	Okay, we liked ac from the star
1868680	1875720	So it was ac umka, which I think means bear or paw and russian. I can't remember. It's one or the other something like that
1876200	1878200	and and then ac show
1878600	1880040	um
1880040	1885000	For ac hot as in opposites, but she was always going to be a polar bear
1885960	1887720	uh, and then
1887720	1889720	We got bander
1889720	1892920	I feel like bander is that it's like a kind of mythological
1893800	1895320	angle
1895320	1901080	And then we got ac snow paws and I was like that's absolutely adorable. I love it
1901160	1906600	It's easy to remember like I know some people are dogging on the names like I'm sorry
1906680	1913560	But we're an english-speaking agency. I don't see the point of having like yuku solavia and a surname
1914040	1918040	Like in japanese, I just I'm like i'm not gonna remember it joystick child
1919480	1920600	Um
1920600	1923640	Me I was pretty quick. I knew I was going to be strongy off the bat
1923800	1926520	I knew I was going to name myself after my dad's gamer tag strontium
1926840	1931080	It's not his actual gamer tag before anyone worries that like his literal thing. Don't worry
1931160	1934280	I was always going to be strongy, but it was like I don't know where 365
1934360	1940920	I actually don't remember 365 at all. Don't remember a spiral swirl notice the check mark against swirl
1940920	1943800	That's because I approved it and then you know, I was a cut official
1943800	1946120	I was like, you know what strongy calls locket and boys
1946680	1951320	And then she be because of her shabari rope. She was always going to be she be like she be
1952360	1953720	um
1953720	1956520	And then we really liked cotton, but obviously there's a
1957080	1961400	You know cotton tails of a va. So we didn't want to step on anyone's tail. You know I'm shining
1962760	1964600	and
1964600	1970200	So we got cotton bud and then we got cotton maw, but that didn't work and then we got cotton bum
1971320	1976120	And then we're like that makes perfect sense because she has a tail if you didn't know three members avail or have a tail
1977000	1981880	She's a distant relative. Yeah, honestly, it's fine. We were not wanting to step on anyone name wise
1982600	1985880	But yeah, as I said, emmy is not here because emmy's name got nailed off the bat
1985880	1991400	I don't care what anyone says. I have never named someone more perfect than emmy, but I promise you I'm not naming anyone else after this because
1992360	1993240	I
1993240	1995640	People are kind of like, oh why why the french route?
1996120	1997080	um
1997080	2002040	I don't know. I think it's pretty easy to remember everyone's name like that clap along with me chat
2002680	2004120	emmy
2004120	2005720	ac
2005720	2007160	she be
2007160	2008760	strongy
2008760	2010280	merci
2010280	2012280	Azara
2012360	2017320	Like these names are not hard to freaking remember in my opinion. Okay
2019160	2021160	Yeah, um
2021800	2025480	Okay, this is just about a feedback if anyone reaches out to the emails
2026280	2032120	The dev team get back to me a lot. Um, if you are applying to be an editor, some people do still submit it
2032120	2034760	We're always kind of looking for clippers editors so you can submit yourself
2035640	2040360	If you apply and be like, hey, I want to be an editor right?
2040920	2049960	And you don't attach a portfolio or any evidence history of editing or a youtube where you've done like a playlist of edits
2050920	2054440	Bro, we're not gonna reply. You're wasting your time
2055400	2057480	You need apply. Yeah, do not apply with
2058920	2063800	Fondle is crazy. Right, right. I know it was a bad name. Okay. Let me let me care. Um
2065320	2071720	We've had some music creators reach out. That's fantastic that do original songs. So for the vealor members that want to pursue
2072360	2078680	Um singing, uh, there might be original songs coming out. There's a few song covers. I'm gonna try and I think she
2078680	2084280	Has an interest. I'm gonna try and poke a zura to do some song covers or maybe some lullabies because her voice is just
2085160	2087160	for it and
2087320	2093480	Uh, hot to the cleavage right enough to uh, I tried my best but a zura was hard to name but come on a zura duly
2094120	2095560	literally, uh
2095560	2097560	goddess of milk if you will
2098360	2099880	um
2100600	2103240	This is the most embarrassing part
2103960	2111480	The first name a concept for the agency was V sucky and now we are all succubus
2115240	2119400	And the motto would you survive if you met one of us?
2122280	2128440	Like so the concept was like succubus blood was like seeping into these girls somehow
2129480	2131480	because I don't like when
2132200	2138120	Vtuber stories like all connect like me and Icy would never meet because I'm in the water and she's on land type thing
2138120	2141880	Like I don't like when agencies like force the lore to come together
2142600	2144600	So a concept of that and I was like
2145720	2151880	No, we're not so before anyone makes fun of vealor vealor terrible name
2152200	2156440	We could have been v sucky. Okay as in short for virtual succubus
2157000	2161080	So, uh, I will not be taking any statements and things. Okay
2161880	2163880	You're all done. Okay
2164120	2168520	This is just a fun behind-the-scenes special shout out to yumi yumi works
2168920	2172120	They are magnificent and made all over loading screens
2172840	2178120	As you can see these are just the concepts, but they're still stunning and it's nice to see behind-the-scenes stuff, but um
2179480	2182920	Mercy's was influenced by the joker
2183720	2190840	Being surrounded by knives in the batman scene unironically acy if you didn't catch acy's
2191800	2192920	um
2192920	2196840	loading screen is a bit mella melancholy melancholy
2197320	2198840	um
2198840	2200040	where
2200040	2201240	the
2201240	2202280	A
2202280	2205800	The borealis that comes up lights up her thingy
2205880	2210360	But hers is a bit more sad because she's just left her polar bear family
2211320	2213160	melancholic
2213160	2215480	Isn't colic when babies are crying
2216440	2223560	Aurora borealis I always want to say ariola borealis and I'm pretty sure that means a nip, but I'm trying. I'm trying, bro
2224200	2226200	Uh, she be nailed off the bat
2226280	2230920	Um, I wanted everyone's mascot to be a part of the loading screen because I just find that stuff adorable
2231000	2237320	And yes, viola did premake all the mascots. Uh, emmy uh elected to change hers. Absolutely fine. No problems
2237800	2243240	Like we're not a dictating agency. The girls can come to me and be like, I didn't like that. I want something else. Yeah, that's fine. Um
2244200	2248760	Uh, Azura, you'll notice did get a new scene that she used on debut
2249560	2251720	um
2251720	2256200	But yeah, this is just behind the scenes kind of this is the oh my god, it's dempa fish
2256600	2262840	Surprise, you know how on debut I was like, I have ASMR clubs planned with other vtubers. Yeah, so a dempa fish is one of them
2264200	2265880	um
2265880	2271640	But yes, this is just kind of behind the scenes aren't just to see how it comes together. No, right. Okay. Okay, this next bit
2271880	2280200	So everyone likes the designs. Yeah, all the designs are 10 out of 10, aren't they? Oh, we just love the design
2280280	2282280	We did not
2287240	2290040	We did not look like how we look no
2290840	2292520	Okay
2292520	2294760	We do not look like how we look no
2296840	2298360	Yeah
2298360	2299640	Yikes
2299720	2301720	Now Emi and Azura
2302120	2307640	Emi and Azura. Yeah, uh, I just yeah, so as you can see I see it's an even in the lineup
2309160	2310840	Yet five is me
2310840	2313320	Uh, I always had bunch double bunches in my hair
2313320	2319480	So I have two bunches in my hair like the seashells are just accessories, but there's actually two bubbles. But yeah
2320440	2322440	Sheebie was also
2322760	2324760	the heck
2324760	2326760	with uh triple C's
2327480	2333800	Uh, Azura and thingy, but then you know things changed. So then the next lineup we're like, right change it
2334680	2337320	Next lineup aces with us. Let's go
2338520	2340520	um
2341080	2342280	Uh
2342280	2345720	Mercy's hair has changed so she no longer has drills
2347480	2352040	Uh, I've changed a bit. I've got like these weird spirals in my hair, but I quite like that. It's quite unique
2352920	2354920	Sheebie is still purple
2355800	2360760	We're changing you but we do have ac developed. Okay. We have ac developed now. Okay change again
2361560	2363560	All right, body type change on sheebie
2363960	2366600	Strone complete change on strone
2367320	2369720	Mercy again still the wrong hair color
2372760	2380760	And then next okay, let's try again and as you can see hates were established and names were established
2381320	2385560	My height got changed. Sheebie's got changed. Azura became taller because
2386120	2389800	We made her a giant test. If you didn't know Azura can
2390920	2396280	Be as tall as a skyscraper. Now, there's not an indefinite height, but yeah
2397400	2398280	um
2398280	2400280	Mercy's coming out with a
2400520	2409000	Short very shortly about her being blonde. You'll like it. Um, and then here we go big changes on me and sheebie at the same time
2410840	2411720	so
2411720	2413720	Sheebie got her hair spirals
2414360	2415880	Um her ears
2415880	2421000	Concepted and then I started to come to life. Um, as you can see I have little shoesies on
2421560	2423560	The shoesies got taken away
2423640	2425080	Why am I in a different style?
2425080	2431000	Well, I had to go a different concept artist because we were struggling at the time. Um, and then eventually
2431320	2432680	ac was getting developed
2432680	2437800	So this that was her first development footage of her model that kind of transition you see there
2438200	2440200	As you see Mercy's hair is still wrong
2440840	2444680	They took your kicks. I know they yanked my shoes. Give me them back
2446280	2449480	Actually, oh my god, I should be like, uh, right there we go. So
2450600	2452600	We're going to take it from the top
2453560	2460040	The first girl developed. Uh, what am I doing for time? Oh, I'm actually not doing bad for time. Let's go school
2461960	2463720	Um
2463720	2466920	I was good. I was good. Uh, right. We're going to take it from this top
2467800	2471640	Emmy was the first conceptualized veiler
2472840	2474600	girl, okay
2474600	2480360	But she ain't look like that the star boom. Oh wait wrong one wrong one. Hold on. Hold on out. Wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on
2480920	2483800	Hold on. Don't don't like don't like no. No, no, right. There we go. Boom
2484520	2486520	This is the first
2486840	2489560	official concept of emmy
2491640	2494840	Yeah, that's what emmy emmy looks like at the start
2495800	2499080	Mm-hmm. You can kind of see it that she's got the sneakers
2499800	2503480	She's got the uh, the hoodie uh, the hair is orange
2504200	2507560	but uh, it's giving it's giving best
2508680	2511320	Frendo next door. It's not giving emmy isn't
2512040	2514040	Frankie. Oh, honestly. Yeah
2514200	2516840	I said squish her down make her a wee one
2517720	2519720	So then we got her squished down
2520040	2527800	Uh, we're starting to get uh, definitely getting her silhouette going on but no pins. We do have her uh, how you call them?
2528280	2529160	Uh
2529160	2533880	Pumpkins in her hair have been established at this point. Yeah, she got hydraulic pressed
2534680	2539400	Uh, and then we're like and back to the drawing board. Go next
2539960	2545800	It was like hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. We're cooking. We are cooking by gas, okay
2546520	2551240	So we were getting very close as you can see by this design very very close in the concept art
2551800	2553800	So then we gave her the old
2553960	2560280	Overwatch skin if you don't know overwatch sell skins by recoloring them. She got recolored
2561320	2566360	Uh, there we go. That was it. That was it. Boom recolored and just like that. There's emmy. That's emmy
2567560	2568920	There's emmy
2568920	2570920	There she is
2571480	2574680	So gave her the old overwatch skin color change and boom
2575560	2577320	Ta-da
2577320	2583240	Uh, and then there is some behind scenes uh banner. This commission wasn't able to be finished. Um
2584200	2588040	But I thought to show it off anyway. This is by papa perito
2588840	2591000	Incredibly good artist sadly ran out of time
2591640	2593640	due to life constraints. However
2594680	2600200	I know you won't be able to tell but this was originally going to be your banner and it's actually a skyroom reference
2600440	2606360	Sweet mother sweet mother send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear
2606360	2611000	It is the sacrament done to summon the night mother satans
2612360	2616200	Uh, that was her reference for the banner. Okay up next
2617160	2620200	Azura or should I say stacey milkerton?
2621240	2626440	Uh, here we go. Boom. Okay. So that was her name hearty hearty heart. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm bad at naming
2626920	2632040	So this was her banner concept that ended up becoming her loading screen
2633160	2637320	This is our banner concept. It didn't get finished, but this is now her new loading
2638120	2640120	Fondle of bosom
2642840	2644840	So
2644840	2647480	Development on azura was so simple
2648120	2651400	It was easy peasy lemon sco easy
2652040	2657560	We had thick goddess straight from the bat. We knew we wanted her thick. We had horns
2658200	2661720	Uh concept art said fantastic because this is what we got next
2663240	2671000	Boom, she's already there. You know what's different, but look at this azura azura was nailed off the bat the most simplest
2671640	2673480	easiest
2673480	2679960	Design honestly, so as you can see she's pretty much there. So as we progress right something's not right with the legs, right?
2680680	2686280	Okay, boom. We've now got stirrup thigh highs. You are welcome
2687320	2689480	chocolate stirrup thigh high
2691560	2693560	Words and stuff
2695000	2698040	Okay, right. Right. Right. What's what's missing? Hold on. What's missing?
2698760	2700760	Something's not quite finished with her
2700840	2708600	Markings. Yes, that makes sense. She's a goddess add them markings. So nose arm thigh add them markings. Okay. Okay. We're cooking
2708920	2710920	We're cooking
2710920	2712520	We're cooking
2712520	2716360	And then oh, what was that? Did you see that? Did you see that change on the thigh? Boom
2717080	2720520	Little little thigh things going on beautiful beautiful gorgeous
2721400	2723400	And then next next next what's next?
2723560	2728920	Uh, I think that's actually an older one there and I was just thinking that and then boom
2729560	2733240	She got her toe rings added. Let's go toe rings
2735640	2737720	And now we have azura there we go
2739240	2741240	I was going to be a milk god
2742920	2746280	Nate it should very should very simplistic very easy very quick
2747160	2749160	Uh, right
2749400	2751880	Please hold on to your hats
2752680	2754680	Because I present to you
2755240	2757240	AC
2757560	2759560	No, not that
2759880	2761720	That's that's ac
2762520	2763880	Uh
2763880	2765880	Yeah, that was ac
2766920	2768440	um
2768520	2770520	Enjoy
2773800	2775560	Okay
2775560	2780440	AC was conceptualized to be an insomniatic gamer. Okay
2782120	2787960	We kept the insomniatic vibes because if you didn't know polar bears do not hibernate
2788680	2790680	Unless they're pregnant. So
2791480	2795480	If see y'all better you better jump off my daughter right now. Okay
2796440	2798440	She she doesn't need to hibernate
2799160	2807560	However, please I would like to draw your attention to the paws. See those neon blue paws. They were supposed to follow her around
2808520	2810520	Polar bear paws
2810680	2816360	Oh, okay. So we took it from there. We took it from there. Yeah, that's actually that's where we started
2816440	2820600	And then we got the polar bear paws added in these antenna things and it just
2821560	2826040	Was me looking me was me was me congealing and then look at that
2826120	2830840	Look at the pillow the belly button. Please analyze the belly button for me because there's a lot of polar bear
2831400	2833400	piercing on her stomach
2834360	2838200	Uh, yeah, originally she was to have a wee person and uh
2839320	2845800	Both the concept artist and I were like look it's not working out. We're gonna need to be we're gonna need
2846120	2848120	We're gonna need you to cook so whoa
2849080	2851080	We're changing it up. So acie
2852360	2856760	Had little little braids little tribal braids and she's freaking adorable
2857160	2860840	And the top of her shirt's all ripped up. But she has like big baggy sleeves
2861400	2866040	Getting very cute. It does look a bit sleep whereas, but she had a little piercing as well here a little tummy pierce
2867080	2869720	Um, we're getting a bit closer to acie. We know today
2869720	2871720	Hmm
2871960	2875960	And then okay, we got another design. We've taken away the long sleeve. So
2877560	2881560	We're not quite there yet. We're not quite there yet. Hold on. Hold on. Okay, okay
2881560	2887480	We're getting a bit more primal now. Look at the gloves gloves glove check glove check. Okay. Gloves are on check
2888360	2892760	Well, they wear gloves at the start but then they became paws
2893240	2898920	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So we had a little comparison and then whoa, hold on hold on
2899480	2903400	We have paws established. We have an ace
2904040	2906280	tight design established
2907080	2909080	very bare-esk
2909080	2910360	And then
2910360	2915880	Yeah, we we got we got there. So she has her insomniatic eyes on she has a toggle for insomniatic eyes
2916280	2919720	But she's insomniatic but take a little look at her feet. They're so different
2920680	2922680	She had open toe boots
2922680	2924680	She had her little toes out
2924680	2927640	But you can see she definitely has claws at this part of development
2927640	2930520	But she has scars all over her ripped clothing that kind of thing
2931960	2938360	Um, and if you really want to zoom in she actually has a tiny tiny cleavage line because she has a little something there
2938920	2940920	Uh, emi is true petam
2941320	2945240	But acie uh has just uh just a little hint of something, you know
2945880	2947800	Uh, oh, uh, this shouldn't be in the middle of it
2947800	2952440	But this was her banner concept because she's a little insomniac
2953080	2956040	Okay, she's a little insomniac. She's so tired
2956680	2960520	She's up at 3am. So this was her banner, but it didn't get finished
2960920	2966840	Due to time constraints, absolutely no fault of papaparito at all. He was fantastic. That's a very adorable banner
2967560	2972120	Um, yeah, as I said the name concepts and then this was her first model
2972280	2978200	Uh, draft not model. Sorry like the the the the draft of the model
2979080	2983720	And we were like, oh, was it no that what that was the first draft and we're like
2985800	2992360	Get those thighs thicker and squish her please and then we squished her down got nice and squished
2993400	2995400	Um, and then there's acie
2996280	2999400	Uh, uh, yeah, there she is
2999800	3004680	That's acie cool. Uh, she was definitely a bit more difficult in development just because we
3005400	3012840	I gave the wrong prompts to the concept artist. So that's on me. So she took a wee bit longer to get there
3014360	3016360	Uh for mercy
3016920	3021320	Uh, please remember her code name was karam. I may accidentally refer to her as karam
3021400	3025640	I've called her karam for an entire year. Please understand. Please forgive. Okay
3026680	3028920	Uh, this was a banner that was supposed to be
3030200	3032200	for mercy
3032200	3037000	Um, it was going to be darkened out and shadowed a lot more but obviously there was a bit insidiousness
3037720	3039720	and in background and
3041720	3045400	Uh going on but yes, so originally
3046360	3049400	I originally mercy had twin tails
3050120	3051560	or drills
3051560	3053880	Kind of looking thing going on
3055000	3062360	Um, but she always had her bow her stomach wasn't showing actually just her mid drift. I believe it's a terminology for that
3062760	3065480	Um, I stole her wig honestly
3066120	3073720	Um, but yeah, uh, we definitely were really close to mercy right from the start, but she was blonde
3074680	3077400	Well, would it well a blonde? I know
3078760	3085320	Um, and then we showed her stomach and it was like, okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
3086120	3091560	And then we got blonde and alterations in comparison
3092440	3095560	But now obviously you've seen that purple
3096280	3099480	So she's purple. You know what I'm saying out here is purple
3100120	3103160	Uh, but now that I see blonde mercy
3103240	3107640	It does not like it looks wrong to me because it's like that's not how it should be looking
3109080	3112280	Um, and then we got purple eyes
3113080	3115080	Here we're the purple beam right now
3115720	3123080	And then boom we got her mercy starts. I've not called her karambi accident in so long
3123880	3125240	Uh
3125240	3130600	But yeah, there you go. Uh, she was relatively there. She was there from the start. Honestly, uh, not too much of a
3131400	3133640	Issue, you know, you can see the comparison. Um
3134520	3135800	She be
3135800	3139240	She be I'm sorry to expose you like this
3142040	3144520	This is the first sign of she be
3145400	3153480	I'm sorry. Okay. We thought of a rabbit with her ears up. Okay. We're sorry. I'm sorry. Okay
3154440	3158200	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, so
3159240	3164600	You were supposed to have mercy. No, not fondle of booze. I'm the she be cotton boom
3166840	3172920	Okay, we didn't go with the design before anyone said we didn't go with the design relax
3173640	3175640	Who said FNAF Bonnie?
3177160	3178840	That's awful
3178840	3184680	Don't speak for the rest of the stream. We didn't go for the design. So
3186920	3191720	Um, Azura was already established to be purple at this point. So
3193000	3197080	We were changing the body tape and then the body tape got changed
3197160	3202600	So she became like the stereotypical milk body type of the boobanda hips
3203320	3206520	Um, and then but we're still purple and we were having
3207480	3212760	I'll be honest. This was getting really frustration frustration. Lovely. This is getting really
3213320	3219960	Frustrating at this point in development. She be we had been cooking for a bit and we were really struggling like but then
3221560	3223560	We had I don't think these are in order
3224600	3226600	No, they're not. Oh well. Hey, ho
3226920	3227960	So
3227960	3231880	We were having color palette issues. I like the outfit. I liked everything about it
3231880	3234840	But the hair the color palette was just not working
3235160	3242680	So I went to a concept artist to very quickly give me a different pose and we went with two hairstyles. Let's say give me this hairstyle
3243720	3248200	Uh, she looks like a fucking giraffe. So, no, we didn't go with a body ponytail
3248280	3250280	She looks like some sort of horse a chivalre
3250840	3255000	Like unparred like I didn't want a horse vtuber if you want a horse vtuber
3255480	3258920	We ain't the agency for you because I'm not interested in horse girls
3259560	3265080	Okay, but we got the drills and if you didn't know shebe's drills actually get more red at the bottom
3265560	3267960	It's a very small detail very small detail
3268520	3274600	Come ride this pony. Honestly. Oh, that's why you've got a riding crop. You're a secret horse vtuber all along shebe
3274600	3276600	I can't believe I've got you in 4k
3277160	3279160	but yeah, um
3279240	3281240	as you can see the
3282040	3285880	Little bit gear. Um, it was always a part like the anklet the
3286600	3289000	Hand cuffs were always going to be a part of her design
3289720	3296280	And then we got our first model back and we were like, uh, excuse me. Where's the thickness?
3296680	3303080	Like give us something like this and then you know came along and then hey, oh, it's so easy
3304120	3306120	It's not the main focus
3306600	3308120	Not the main focus
3308120	3310680	Okay, this was her banner concept
3311160	3314440	Uh, again banner concept my legs are long
3315320	3321080	These are your banner concepts, but uh, unfortunately didn't make it to finalize production, but this was to be the banner
3321320	3324840	It's probably a bit too much now that i'm looking at it a bit a bit too a bit too
3324920	3327480	Spacey a bit too spacey for you
3328040	3330040	I see it
3330360	3331560	right
3331560	3333560	my tone
3333720	3335720	womp womp
3335880	3338520	Womp womp there's straw name
3338520	3349640	There we are. That's me at the start of development. Do you like it? What do you think?
3351000	3353240	Is it good? Is it peak quick?
3354200	3357880	I'm going to very quickly go get a cool look as my voice is dying. Give me one second
3358440	3362840	I know streamers are supposed to be open. Oh, I don't know if you heard me
3368680	3379640	I don't need to point in mutant because i'm literally going in the kitchen now i'm back in the room and the truck is working again
3380120	3383640	I stubbed my toe when I left the room that actually really hurt
3384920	3386200	okay
3386200	3387720	So yeah, uh
3387720	3393560	My development was different because I was allowed to dictate my design. Okay, so we started with hypnosis
3394120	3400040	And then I was a little splatoon squiddle fish ms paint looking ass. You don't watch that. You're done. You're done
3400600	3402600	Okay, so I was a squiddle
3403560	3409160	And then so this design don't write this design off. I want to develop this further. I love the color scheme
3409240	3411640	I love the bikini type thing going on
3412440	3415480	um the only thing that kill oh wait, I need to open my cola
3416680	3418680	the only thing like
3419400	3424840	I think this might be an all outfit all hairstyle because I love those like cat ear looking things on me
3424840	3428360	And I had my little shell on my hair at this point Zelda looking ass
3429800	3434680	No, don't insult it. I think it's really good. I really like this design
3434680	3436760	I like the color scheme with the browns and the
3437560	3441320	Kind of black thing going on. It's good. It's good. You know, let me cook. Let me cook
3443560	3444920	so
3444920	3449640	I originally wasn't gonna have any booba basically because um
3450120	3455720	But then that got changed because I technically have five children with emmy and isi and azura
3456440	3460760	And mersey and sheevee. So I originally didn't have any chest size
3460840	3465880	But then we retconned that because technically uh, yeah, uh very big on the dumpy
3466840	3471880	So I had clocks for hypnosis to hang off. I always had hypnosis from the star and then
3472360	3475560	Changed the color a bit, but then I look like an xbox
3478520	3480520	And then
3480600	3482520	it's
3482520	3487400	But that wasn't this shouldn't be here. We're still a bit too early because uh
3488280	3492600	There's one more design that we didn't finish off. This is Celtic me
3493720	3498600	um, I definitely am getting an alternative outfit of Celtic me because
3499480	3504040	I know it might be hard to tell with the accent and all but I'm just a wee bit scottish
3504360	3510280	But I try and annunciate and make sure you guys can understand me. So yeah, I don't talk the way like
3511000	3516200	I'm an accent, but I'm definitely getting this developed further the hair. Uh, I like big hair
3516280	3521320	So I'm probably not gonna keep that hairstyle going on, but I had like a little ears going on little squiddled ears
3522760	3526040	Um, but that got developed a bit more this honestly looks kind of a bit
3526440	3532280	Renny's Renny thorns, but if you look at that, this is like very Celtic origin and like little symbolism and that that
3532680	3537880	Definitely gonna develop this because uh, it's good, but it wasn't what I wanted the
3539400	3542360	The default to be the default that's the word. Um
3543480	3551640	Yeah, I got a thingy my hair probably changed that. Oh, I got that foreign to the Celtic design. Oh my god. I completely forgot
3552600	3556440	Well, there's my Celtic. There's my next outfit boys. Uh
3558120	3561080	But yeah, very very squiddled very Celtic here. Um
3562840	3564840	Yeah, uh
3566840	3568840	Yes, um
3568840	3574760	I was presented with my squiddled eyes here and I actually have a bikini toggle
3574920	3578520	Obviously, I'm not gonna do it right now because now's not the time for it
3578840	3583880	But I have a pair less and I have tape over me, but you see like I technically have tape over my
3585160	3587880	Bits, you know bits if I go back a few
3588920	3596120	Um, yeah, I did I really like this Celtic warrior one because I can just I'll just talk about the battle of bannock burn all the time
3597080	3601080	Why not? But yeah, you can definitely see me starting to come to life here
3601640	3607880	Uh, like the shell of my hair. I did have two bunches, but they weren't as big like I have really big bunches
3608840	3610840	um
3611080	3617720	Got like and then my eyes so my default eyes were going to be swirls, but then I got my squiddled eyes
3618600	3621560	Because I'm a cuttlefish. I'm a cephalopod
3622440	3625800	Yeah, and then I finally came to there's me
3627480	3629480	Ta-da
3629480	3631480	It's a me
3631720	3638920	Uh, and then of course finished models, okay, I'll tell you some hidden things
3640760	3646040	I'm going to tell you some hidden things now. This is this is what agencies kind of have to deal with behind the scenes
3646760	3653080	Azura was conceptualized black. Okay a chocolate to be tuber if you will, okay
3654280	3661000	However, I came to the horrible realization. I can't put a white girl on Azura
3661480	3670120	Oh my fucking god. So Azura in development was made racially ambiguous. Now, I apologize for such terminology
3670280	3672920	But that's just how it is. That's how the facts are
3673640	3679560	So she was made racially ambiguous if you look back in some of the promotional models and artwork
3679640	3687400	She'll notice how pale she was. That's because we had to make her ambiguous. Okay, then Azura came aboard and I was like
3688120	3690120	Choclifier right now
3690280	3692280	Like get on it
3692280	3696840	So, yes, her finalized looks the zoom in a little bit on the finalized model
3697000	3702280	Just to highlight a few things that are going on with her beautiful design. So if you didn't know very quickly
3703000	3710920	Azura's your mummy quite literally lower wise. She's your mama. She is the goddess of fertility on planet earth
3711080	3716440	You heard that right, but she didn't want to go to the heavens with her family
3716920	3718920	She wanted to stay among the humans
3719640	3724440	So she has retained some of her powers as a god
3724520	3725480	Okay
3725480	3729800	So she has the power of flight, believe it or not. So she's gonna fly on my deck
3730280	3733000	Um, I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. Uh
3734920	3737640	She also has healing properties
3738600	3740600	with her
3741080	3743080	milk
3743640	3748120	Um, yeah, uh, she can also be a giantess as tall as a skyscraper
3748280	3755000	These markings are made from when she founded civilization. She has painted nails painted toes
3755000	3757480	She has toe rings on her index toes
3758120	3761080	a little veil over her thigh highs
3762280	3769960	Vail in the head or just hips for days like definitely kind of the the birthing hips because she birthed humanity
3770440	3772680	like that's the kind of thing going on so
3773320	3775320	Yeah
3775400	3780440	Definitely her design was absolutely gorgeous. Um, we had quite a lot of issues
3780600	3784680	I ordered the girls quite a few fan arts once we had the designs finalized
3785480	3789560	There was a lot of issues with artists not understanding the white
3790040	3796280	Is her goat ears and they were drawing her like the star wars characters. You know those characters that have the
3798200	3799720	Like the thing on the front of them
3799720	3804120	We got a lot of artwork of that and I had to send back and be like, no, she's a goat
3804600	3806200	to go
3806200	3808520	Uh go a not door like that. Thanks
3809480	3815960	Um, ace of cool. She's got scars, which is a very unique element to her. She also has a mouth
3816520	3822040	Fang not a tooth fang a mouth fang. Okay, mouth fang
3823320	3825320	She has scars
3825320	3828280	Um, she has ripped clothing
3828280	3830280	Um, she also has
3831080	3834920	Steel toad capped boots. So, you know, she's safe for work
3835480	3839080	100% safe for work character. She got them steel toad boots on. Okay
3840120	3841720	um
3841720	3846920	What other attributes she has a tail? Oh, yeah, uh, zura has a tail and I say has a tail. Um
3847560	3849560	May oh look at me
3850040	3856840	Uh, so, uh, if you didn't know I am wearing a yukata as a nod to japanese culture because
3857480	3862840	Without japanese culture truly as v-tubers, we would not be here right now. Let's not pretend otherwise. Oh
3865000	3869080	I forgot my cover up over my crotch. I am so sorry
3870360	3873640	I forgot about that part of my design
3874360	3876360	Uh, I literally have
3880120	3885320	I flushed your twigs. I'm so sorry. I was supposed to have the bandaid on
3887560	3892600	Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But anyway, I'm in a yukata. Uh, it's pearlescent
3892760	3898200	So it shimmers as I move my uh shells in my head also are pearlescent and I'm so sorry
3898680	3900680	I'm gonna just take a little drink of my cola
3905480	3909960	Oops, uh, but yes, I'm in a yukata as a nod to japanese culture. Um
3910600	3914840	For my next alternative, I almost likely do a scottish Celtic type origin
3915560	3917560	Uh, we can see it. Um
3918920	3922680	Uh, squid eyes. Yep. I am a cuttlefish. I have cuttlefish eyeballs
3923240	3930760	When we released the eye previews people were surprised but for me if v-tubers just have a regular pupil
3932120	3934360	I sleep. I'm sorry
3934360	3940840	But it's like one of the most simplistic things you can design if you give someone a basic pupil as a vtuber
3941160	3943160	Eh boring out
3945960	3948280	I'm sorry. That's just my opinion
3948680	3953800	It was one of the first notes that I gave to the concept artists do not give me a regular pupil
3953880	3959560	I will perish again same with like fingernail designs, etc. I have french tip
3960920	3967240	Manicure pedicure the girls all have painted nails. Merci also has band aids on her fingers, for example
3967720	3968840	um
3968840	3971960	These small things like add up definitely. Um
3973400	3977320	Yeah, like I this is just my opinion, but I think the
3979080	3983320	There's nothing to if a design gets too complex on a vtuber
3983400	3988280	This is just my opinion as well. My opinion just don't do not fucking represent the company as a whole
3988280	3990280	It's just me being
3991240	3992680	But um
3992680	3995160	Like if the designs get too complicated, like I don't know
3995160	3998440	I can't remember what the fucking things call but like, you know, there's japanese
3998840	4004360	Idol skirts where there's like three different meshes and layers and designs and patterns going on
4004440	4007480	I'm like, if you start getting too thingy, you're getting nay fan art
4007640	4013080	No one's going to recognize you because you're xyz like i'm sorry, but you cannae tell me that our designs look
4013240	4018600	Anything remotely similar to clutter. That's the word cluttered if the designs are too cluttered
4019640	4024120	Uh, please think of the fan art literally like I'd say mercy is the most
4025400	4028680	She doesn't have a cover up. We'll enjoy mercy from here
4029240	4038040	Uh, mercy is probably the most complex design we have if you want to think of it as layers in terms of fishnet and bandages and
4040200	4042200	All that jazz, yeah
4043000	4048840	Got strike the balance between not being too over complicated that okay, finally one model that control the full design of
4049640	4050840	uh
4050840	4056120	So if you didn't know she be her hair drills get redder the more bottom you go
4056280	4061000	That's not even a full english sentence. Um, if you didn't
4062200	4065800	No, her thighs got chunked up in development
4066760	4073560	Uh, we went for the classic leg look look some things are classic and you there's no point
4073640	4076840	Don't if it ain't broke don't fix it high heels
4077400	4078680	and
4078680	4079880	stockings
4079960	4081960	If it ain't broke
4082360	4087560	Don't fix it. You don't need to do anything special anything unique
4088280	4094200	Any of that stuff. It's not broke. It's the perfect design. I don't don't even talk to me. Okay
4095320	4097320	um, so obviously
4099800	4101400	My voice is going
4101400	4103720	Hold on. Let me take another drink. Um

4263160	4269080	In terms of like sacrifice and people and stuff it means like a little quirky like that
4269160	4274040	Okay, like whatever she needs to do to get back and you know get her brother back
4275640	4281720	And for the papegas out there you viewing are her brother watching her from afar. Okay

4287080	4289080	Is that everything? No
4289480	4291480	Let's go
4291880	4297400	All the girls descriptions for their newest 2.0's will have merch updates if you didn't know
4299400	4301400	All of the
4302280	4303800	prophets
4303800	4310040	Go to the girls veiler. Do not take a cut of the merchandise. We don't put our little fingies in the merchandise
4310600	4315400	So rest assured if you buy something off uwu market for my buy
4316200	4323080	All that money goes to support in them a lot of the girls are interested in moving out so they can up their streaming time
4323160	4327160	They are trying very hard. I'm trying to support them in any way I possibly can
4327560	4329160	and
4329160	4332840	Hopefully from what you've seen not even to cover the cost. So
4333800	4335560	uwu market
4335560	4341160	Will take their cut or whatever their you know earning is and then whatever is left over is profit-wise
4341240	4346040	Goes straight to the talent. It does not go into vealers like accounts or anything like that
4346360	4353240	So please seriously rest assured like this isn't some sort of money grab agency when you support your talent
4353720	4359000	You support your talent like the talent. Okay. You don't have to think to yourself
4359640	4364120	Oh, if I give a hundred dollars, are they gonna get seven dollars of it? No
4365400	4367720	That's not how it works here. It's not called
4368680	4372440	Guys don't even take two percent. No the hundred percent march to the girls
4373320	4374680	like come on
4374680	4377960	What wouldn't you be like in your head?
4378840	4382280	Wouldn't you be upset if you learned like oh, I supported
4382600	4388680	The my oh shi desu with a hundred dollars and they only made like five bucks because of how much the yoink like
4389800	4391480	You know what I'm saying? So
4391480	4395800	I'm just coming out and saying it 80 20 cut and guess what if the girls stay on another year
4395800	4401480	It goes to a 15 cut for veal or because the girls do all the work. Actually, that's a really good point
4401560	4403560	I might talk about that
4404600	4411080	Um, oh, this is like oh, oh, I need to do my merch. Hold on. I uh, it's a strong image tentacles tentacle power
4411240	4413000	tentacle power
4413000	4418120	Um, I am actually gonna get a keychain because I'm so excited. I'm getting all the girls keychains
4418680	4420760	No, I'm gonna say something
4421720	4423720	And I might filter a few people
4423800	4425800	I'm okay with hand cam streams
4425960	4430760	I'm gonna make an ASMR video of me like tapping on all the keychains of the girls
4430760	4432760	I'm gonna like melise them with my hands
4434440	4439400	Um, so, you know if you are into the vtuber immersion where you don't see any body parts
4439480	4445240	I'm very sorry. I'm not the vtuber for you, but there's definitely veal the lure girl out there for you. Just not me
4446520	4449080	Yeah, I'll be I'm gonna touch all the girls. Okay
4449880	4454440	Yeah, just my keychain. I really like that. This came out so good. I really like it
4456760	4460200	Um, okay, I think we can do the Q&A
4461640	4463640	section now
4464360	4470200	Uh, I am going to link my marshmallow if anyone would like to ask a question in private because I do understand some people
4470760	4472520	are a bit adverse
4472520	4474520	Are a bit embarrassed
4474600	4478360	Uh, so ask any agency related questions here
4478760	4479960	agent sign
4479960	4481160	that's
4481160	4483160	Did that even send? Oh
4484680	4489080	Oh and my toggles are all coming on because I forgot to unbind them from my keyboard. You know what?
4489560	4492920	You know what? If it wasn't a scoff, you wouldn't be enjoying yourself. I will take
4493800	4495960	me out of this. Oh my god. I can hear myself twice.
4497160	4499160	Right, let me pin that message
4500120	4501960	Right, let's see
4502040	4506520	What are the plans for membership streams versus patreon? Let me take my toggle off first
4506680	4512680	Um, so if you want to support the girl on patreon, you will get access to four audios. I would like to comment on that
4513880	4517720	Um, obviously I had to do a lot of preparing in advance
4517800	4523640	It's five dollars to support your girl on patreon for four audios
4523720	4526840	What we are doing is called undercutting the market
4527800	4533000	If you didn't know undercutting the market means you put your product quotation marks out
4533720	4537720	At a rate that is incredibly cheap in comparison to other va's
4538280	4540440	Not only do you get streams from the girls
4540520	4544040	Not only do you get alternative content on their all twitter's for free
4544520	4547000	But we have undercut the market on patreon as well
4547160	4551560	So if you would like to test the content that they produce
4552520	4553800	on patreon
4553880	4555480	I highly recommend
4555480	4557480	Supporting them
4557720	4564200	Over me because I post free stuff all the time. You don't all worry about me. Okay, so support that girl's first
4565240	4569160	It's called undercutting the market isn't a very nice thing to do, but it's uh
4570360	4578520	It is what it is now. I did have a few concerns about the type of audios. Please understand and direct any
4579640	4581640	Disappointments towards me
4581960	4588440	Because um, I did not the girls have shown interest some of them to create the scripts and role plays
4588760	4594040	But please understand. I had to make sure I'm not putting them in a position where they are
4594760	4596760	overstressed or overworked
4597320	4600440	when it comes to balancing streaming and
4603000	4610280	The role plays now I have made them as straightforward and the girls are welcome to talk about their experience on stream
4610440	4613560	Behind the scenes, you know as long as not an nda hens
4614120	4619400	I'm sure they know the difference between like leaking nda content and just being like oh, this is how it works. Okay
4622680	4628120	Well, let's say five dollars forever. Yes. Um, I uh believe um
4629640	4634120	I have no plans to raise the price. I think five dollars. Um
4635080	4636440	is
4636520	4643480	An acceptable price. I'm I'm very aware of the economy the state that the bloody hangs in
4643800	4644600	Um
4644600	4650360	And in order to support your oh shi desks that might be in veiler the maximum price you will pay per month
4650440	4654040	I believe is nine dollars and ninety nine cent us dollars
4654840	4660360	For the maximum price of uh, again all content that your oh shi desks produces. Okay
4661320	4662600	So
4662600	4668680	I wanted it to be as affordable as possible and again that 80 20 split goes across the board your
4669160	4673720	Majority is supporting your talent. It's not getting hogged up to the agency. Okay?
4674520	4675720	Um
4675720	4683000	What will the main content on the youtube channels be streaming? We are v-tubers. We're just regular v-tubers that offer the goods on the side
4685080	4690280	But um, please do not think we are trying to speed run banning our youtube channels
4690440	4693960	Um, there was a few misconceptions out there that we may
4694840	4700040	Do outrageous things. Please understand. Uh, I'm trying to help these girls become
4700600	4705000	content creators of their dreams help them achieve things that they've always wanted to do
4705640	4707640	Hell even get them a play button
4708120	4711720	So as much as jorkin der pintis
4712600	4718600	On youtube would be hilarious content for three seconds. I really don't want them to get banned. So
4718840	4724040	They're just gonna be my lovely v-tribbon gals. Um
4725320	4727320	Yes
4727560	4733240	We need you on stage at a v-tribbon convention. This is insane market and i'm praying insane market
4733800	4738600	What revealing that azur's codename with stacey milker in is insane market
4741720	4743960	No, absolutely no
4745080	4747080	Absolutely no
4749560	4756520	Awesome. Oh, yeah, be sucky by the way instead of veal or be sucky. Oh, you've oh, I've got you right there
4757000	4761400	Nah, I'm talking the behind. Okay. The behind the scenes stuff is all fun to kind of be like
4761800	4768040	So obviously you've just met the girls. I have known them for a year if that makes sense
4768600	4772840	Like these concepts and everything's been going on for a year. I want some v sucky
4772840	4779160	Hey, the behind the scenes content was cringe cringe, but peak. Thank you fondle a bosom
4782280	4783640	Um
4783640	4790280	Can't wait to see be sucky at off guy. Oh, we got all right. No, it's not okay before before I say the story
4790440	4792440	We got uninvited to a convention
4793080	4797720	So the girl we got invited to a convention. Uh, we were getting a free pass
4798440	4803080	And then the girls not safe for work twitters went live and then nine hours later
4803160	4808600	We got an email saying oops our convention is full. Uh, we're not interested anymore
4809000	4813400	But nine hours prior they were like, yeah, we're still interested. Uh, we can set up a booth
4813480	4815640	We can give you free pass to staff members
4816120	4820520	And we got uninvited when the girls not safe for work twitters went live
4820760	4822760	Oh
4824280	4828120	So, yeah, we're kind of spend on that but whatever convention
4828520	4831960	I do have good news that we are going to a convention
4832600	4838440	In 2025, um, it will be remote. I don't think uh, I can physically show up
4838440	4841720	I don't think any of us can for safety or whatever. Although I don't want to
4842440	4847320	That's the stream for me. I'll I'll talk about the idea in the stream. Sorry. My voice is getting fried right now. Can you hear it?
4848280	4849960	Oh
4850040	4853720	Um, no, so the the bizarre thing was on our website
4853800	4856600	We said from the start we're a bit naughty naughty
4856600	4862520	And then the email does on the website like we'd love all your talents to come to our agency to our agency to our convention
4862680	4864360	I was like, hey, yeah
4864360	4869320	And then we really and then we do the thing that we said we were going to do on the website and they were like, oh, sorry
4869320	4871320	We're fully booked me. I'm like
4871560	4873000	Okay
4873000	4877960	Yeah, yeah, that's some fun behind the scenes. I oh don't know the watch alongs
4878600	4884840	Oh my god, if you are a vtuber that has a management that deals with sponsorships
4885480	4888920	You got cucked out of so much money
4890280	4892280	So
4892280	4896920	Oh my god, thank you to everyone who accepted the watch alongs. I'm gonna burp
4898040	4899640	I am so
4899640	4905960	We offer 12,000 us dollars for a three hour react and a watch along
4906040	4908040	Got told nah
4908760	4912840	They were like nah, we don't want to we don't want to put your audio and video on screen

4934200	4939160	Thank you from the bottom of my heart because one you weren't greedy shits
4939800	4944200	And two you actually gave us the time of day. I'm very thankful
4944920	4946920	so, yeah
4947800	4955080	Yeah, vnu thumbs up yumi plus thumbs up a lot of vtuber agencies didn't even respond to emails thumbs down
4956680	4958680	Like not even a courtesy email
4958920	4962760	There's a lot of theories about why we didn't get a response
4963160	4968200	But uh, I completely get it. I'm just freaking meman by the way before you're like, oh my god
4968200	4971000	I hate vtuber agencies. No, it's not how it works
4971640	4977480	um, but um off kai clashed with a lot of things I think I offered like 10,000
4977960	4982840	Oh, that was it. I think I offered a 8,000 to someone and never got response
4983240	4988760	But uh, I'm telling you right now if you have a manager that is a barrier between someone saying to you
4988760	4993240	Hey, I want to sponsor you. Yeah, you got wrecked because there was I think
4994280	4996280	We sent 40 managements
4997800	5000440	emails out with the offer inside
5001880	5003080	and
5003080	5004760	like no response
5004760	5011720	Crickets and the fact that the 12k one was hilarious because the original offer was 10k
5012440	5014440	and then they were like
5014600	5020840	Actually this feature were just 4,000 per hour. So I was like right fine raise our offer to 12k
5021400	5026680	And then we told her like little thing. We're like, yeah, just react to the girls have a audio and and they were like
5027240	5032600	We actually recommend not having the video and audio on so more people go into the streams

5225720	5233960	So the girl's birthdays are when they're going to do donathons and um, I actually might do an open stream
5233960	5235960	Where we can all discuss it together
5235960	5241000	Azura is the first donathon. Don't worry Azura if you're watching. I'm gonna help you through it
5241000	5245960	She doesn't really know what she's doing, but I'll help her. Um, I'm going to focus on
5246920	5248920	public rewards
5249240	5251240	I'm gonna burp again
5251640	5253640	Oh my god
5253960	5256840	Sorry, sorry. Sorry. I'm talking a lot
5257640	5259240	um
5259240	5261240	I'm going to be focusing on
5261720	5263400	Jen
5263400	5268200	The chat going not something I go through it. You see I fell off my chair
5269400	5270920	Sorry
5270920	5272920	um
5273160	5274680	What was I saying?
5274680	5279560	Uh, yes, we can work on donathon goals together. I will help the girls through it because uh, some are a bit unsure
5279640	5282600	They've never done one before hell. I've never done a donathon before
5283400	5289480	Definitely going to focus on public rewards at milestones and this is just me personally
5290120	5294200	I'm absolutely not going for anyone. Don't care what the timing is but um
5295560	5302200	Some like I've seen some donathons and the jump is like 5 000 us dollars between like the next goal
5302440	5304040	And I'm like going to be serious
5304040	5309400	Can you actually not think of one thing to do for like another 500 bucks or like another like
5310040	5313240	One of the biggest jumps I saw I think was 20 000 us dollars
5313240	5319240	I'm like you can't think of like one thing to do in between 20 000 us dollars like no
5319240	5320120	We're not doing that here
5320120	5326200	So I'm helping the girls to try and like pick through what to do for donathons and get rewards and all that thing
5326840	5331640	Uh, I don't know if it was a joke or a meme because it was like pretty crazy
5333320	5335160	um
5335160	5339480	I'd miss this but how does violour make money if almost everything goes to the talent
5340200	5346760	We got so much feedback on that. I this is terrible and I can't believe I have to say this
5347720	5351080	But we're not an agency built on corporate greed
5351720	5353720	Full stop that's the sentence
5354440	5362680	We don't have corporate greed and the running costs of an agency after you've done the start of costs of buying the models and
5363080	5366920	Getting the girls set up for stream is very low
5367240	5371400	It does not cost a lot of money to actually tell the girls to go stream like
5372280	5379400	It doesn't cost me any money right now to click go live and have a good time or to go away and record an ASMR video and upload it
5380040	5385640	I know in this day and age where corporate greed is everywhere around the corner
5386760	5389000	We're not an agency for corporate greed
5389160	5395000	I hope you understand that the 80 20 split for this year the next year if the girl signs on the 15
5395480	5403000	Like the focus on the agency is to help the girls achieve their dreams. I know it's ambitious
5403480	5409480	I know we're new and we're just out of the starting gate, but I hope no strong a yaw
5410120	5412120	fucking burn the yaw
5412840	5419720	No yaw for me because I don't buddy want one. I want the success of my daughters
5420360	5423560	Go subscribe to them. Go give them a chance. Okay
5424520	5429480	I'm not having none of this corporate greed shit in my house. Get the fuck out of here without anyway
5429560	5431560	That's just my two cents
5433240	5435160	But yes, um
5435160	5441160	The reason why the company and oh and another thing and another thing. I'm gonna get started again
5442200	5448600	Oh wait already said that they're already said that the company has been seeded the company is not in debt to banks
5448680	5450680	The company is not indebted to
5451400	5458040	The company has been seeded, which means the money was already there. It was just funneled into this one. Okay
5458920	5460920	Okay
5461240	5462760	Woohoo
5462760	5468440	Oh, what about legal staff? Are you ready for this bit? We don't even have a hr department
5468600	5470840	We just sexually harass each other for fun
5471320	5473320	Yippie
5474840	5476840	We don't have that kind of business set up
5480280	5485720	Is there's no hr so none of the girls can report to me report me if I say anything not
5490440	5495000	Sorry, I keep taking a drink of coal and then hypnotizing you real quick. That's true
5495960	5500680	I'll actually everyone gets paid. That was another thing that came up actually. Um
5501960	5509320	How this is this is actually not vtuber related. This is just human related and it's like hey, how do you get your
5509960	5511400	um
5511400	5516440	Your employees to like work and it was like, uh, actually pay them above minimum wage
5516920	5519800	Like if you go to the girls and go would you rather?
5520120	5522120	Ah
5522440	5524440	Atchoo
5524920	5529960	Okay, maybe we do slightly maybe have some sort of management. I'm fucking scared. Get out of here management
5533000	5537160	I don't run the social accounts or anything like that. My gosh. My gosh. My gosh
5538040	5540680	Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't say anything more
5544040	5548280	Okay, okay, I call I call most of the shots I call most of the shots
5550280	5553080	Right, what was that saying? Oh, right. Yeah, if you're
5553960	5559000	I think one of the it was like the most dumbest post was like I can't get my employees to work hard type thing
5559400	5562440	And it was like, uh, yeah, because you're paying them minimum wage
5562600	5565560	Maybe if you actually make them feel like valued employees
5566040	5570040	Uh, which is where the 8020 split came in as well because I'm really sick of seeing vtuber agencies
5570040	5573960	Just being really greedy and I was like, well, I'm gonna do the opposite and I get to call the shots
5574040	5578440	So, yeah, 820 time for a black. No, not the freaking white
5579000	5583160	No, the black text on the white background. Oh my god. I'm being graduated already
5583560	5588200	Oh, it was a good run. That was a good run. See you next year when I start up the next feature break
5591480	5595480	Uh, it's 3d content plan for we need we just go out of the gates
5595560	5601480	You need to give the girls some some money if you want to get 3d models because uh, we spend a lot of money
5601480	5606200	Just get into the stage. Okay. I'm gonna be honest and you put your money where your mouth is if you want to see that content
5608040	5611720	Vsucky 2026, let's go Vsucky
5614440	5616600	That's why you guys stream on youtube instead of twitch
5616680	5623960	So twitch and youtube is like pick the lesser of two evils and from a management point of view youtube
5623960	5625960	You can manage accounts on
5626920	5631160	We regret to inform you that strongly causes me power. Oh, that's another thing. Yeah
5631560	5632840	We don't have
5632840	5636120	Uh, what's the word? I've already forgotten the word because we don't do it
5636760	5641800	What is it called when management put the talent on leave like forced leave?
5642600	5645240	What the heck is that word? I don't even know what that word is
5648120	5653720	Shadowban, yeah, we don't suspension. We don't do suspensions at vlr. So rest assured
5654360	5659960	When your vtuber is self-suspense. Yeah, we don't do that here. The girls don't get suspended
5660440	5665000	I have this terrible thing. It's called a treating people like adults
5665880	5669880	And yeah, we don't do suspensions. Uh, if the girls do a naughty, naughty, guess what?
5669880	5675640	I'm not their mom. I'm not here to spank their butt and be like, you're a naughty naughty girl. Um, so
5676600	5678600	yeah
5679400	5682280	Yeah, the girls do what they want. It's crazy
5682360	5686600	It's like if you treat people like adults then they kind of act like adults
5686760	5689880	It's a wild concept really. It's really crazy in this day and age
5692920	5695480	What if she be suspending from the ceiling?
5696680	5701640	What are your plans for youtube membership? Whatever the girls want to do for membership
5701720	5707400	They have complete control of I have I am not dictating any talents content at all
5707480	5711320	I do not dictate it. I do not tell them what to stream. I do not tell them what to do
5711400	5715320	So what they would like to do in their membership streams are completely up to them
5716200	5718760	I do not dictate. We don't dictate in this house
5719400	5723240	We treat people like adults. Why act like an adult when fondle abyssal?
5725800	5730520	It was a bad name. It was one bad name. Okay. They were all bad concept names
5730920	5736680	But give me credit for freaking emmy bezoo. Come on, man. That's such a cute name. We emmy bezoo

5796120	5798120	Guidances for this agency
5799080	5805560	Uh, just let the vtuber talk and uh, let the talent talk and if she doesn't like what you're saying she'll say it
5805720	5808600	But like obviously because the agency is a bit more
5812280	5814280	Uh, obviously the chat can be a bit more
5815560	5817560	Uh, yeah
5817960	5820280	No, she be's gone live in 30
5820920	5823160	I'm gonna raid into her and then I'm gonna do my two
5823800	5830040	2.0, but I don't have to be professional in it like after the stream. Oh, I'm not being very professional right now
5830040	5832040	I'm a burping into your mouth, but um
5832600	5837320	After uh, I'm just memeing as myself. I don't have to do any more official stuff

5846280	5847960	uh
5847960	5853960	Would it be okay to create fan comics and post online? Absolutely the girls love any fan arts coming through as beautiful
5856840	5861880	Wait 100 duck sized ryan reynolds or 100 ryan reynolds duck sized
5862840	5863960	to keep
5863960	5869080	What what how is that agency related at all? You're just bamboozling me
5871080	5874120	Um, I know this may be jumping the gun quite a bit
5874600	5880600	But based on how you think have you already thought about gen 2 possibilities? Oh, that's a good question. Um
5882360	5883560	Uh
5883560	5889080	For the donathons of the girls one of the goals will be revealing a concept art of gen 2
5889240	5894520	I understand we've just debuted, but if I'm happy to be as open as you guys are interested
5894600	5899160	So you're welcome to ask any questions. Uh, but yeah one of uh azure's
5900040	5905000	Pfft donathons coming up and you guys can vote to reveal a design if you want up to you
5906120	5907560	um
5907560	5912040	Someone asked if it's possible. We would have a branch
5912920	5917960	Um a branch of veiler that didn't require the not-safer work
5918840	5920840	audio parts
5922280	5924280	In the nicest way
5924360	5926360	I
5927400	5929400	The cut wouldn't be the same
5930520	5933480	I just I couldn't I can't see it working out
5934120	5938120	Everything is based on what I have learned over the span of many years
5938760	5940760	of what is occurring
5940760	5942760	Tan cute and funny. I bet she
5944120	5945960	She didn't
5945960	5949800	Okay, I will tell the plan later. You can tell it on your screen if you want to but
5952120	5954120	Um
5955240	5957240	Will the patreon uploads
5957560	5962200	Be dictated by the talents. No the content is given by management
5962600	5965400	I actually have a script manager coming in place soon for the girls
5965880	5971960	If you have any audios that you don't like, please direct your grievances with me at this stage
5972120	5977320	And then you can grieve at the manager that's coming in because that can't be our stealing all the scripts
5978440	5980440	Um
5981720	5983720	Yes
5984280	5992120	The girls are not pigeonholed into one category of audios that would be impossible to get them to succeed
5992840	5999640	That is just the truth of the matter. I understand that some of the audios might not play into the thingy
6000120	6004040	But I cannae have polar bear shags you polar bear shags you again
6004520	6008360	Polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear
6008840	6010840	Be in every single audio
6010840	6012840	Please be realistic with me
6012840	6014840	That's not gonna appeal to the masses
6015320	6022360	And at the end of the day, uh, these girls are wanting to move out. They're wanting to save money for their futures
6022440	6027240	They want to pay off debts possibly this kind of thing. So please
6028520	6030920	Please be realistic with us. Okay
6033320	6035320	Thank you. I do appreciate that
6035800	6039000	Um, is there a way to submit scripts for the talents?
6039720	6045160	Possible plausible at this point in time. I do not have a system in place like that
6046040	6052040	It is plausible in the future. Uh, you'll have to let things things need to kind of we need to level out and we need to
6052520	6053720	um
6053720	6058680	How do you call it? We need to like settle down the dust hasn't settled literally we're freaking day
6059240	6060760	debuted
6060760	6062760	Um all that kind of thing. Um
6062760	6064760	Hmm
6064920	6071400	How likely are what are off club? How likely are off collabs based on location?
6072760	6075160	You mean like the girls meeting up?
6076280	6078280	I can make it happen
6078920	6083320	I get taxed back on their travel expenses. I can make that shit happen if they want
6086280	6088280	Um
6088600	6096600	Uh, you said violour does not require the girly pops to get permission for various projects
6097320	6099320	Uh, how about showing face?
6099480	6104520	No, I don't really recommend it for him. Well, uh, so isn't male collabs?
6104760	6107640	You'll never guess what one of the unwritten rules of ours are
6108360	6110360	Uh
6111000	6114840	There ain't gonna be any males on this. How do you pronounce violour?
6115240	6120600	Well, I'm Scottish so the word I look like a luring. You're a luring violour, but
6121160	6122680	V allure
6122680	6128920	But if you ever come from a different place, yeah, like feet cam hand cam that stuff's fine. The girls don't need permission for that
6129560	6135720	Uh, you'll never see my face. Phil stop and I'm a feature. Yeah, I'd say probably face stuff is like
6137480	6140040	I'll never I'll never stop the talent but
6141560	6143560	Um
6144520	6146520	Uh
6148600	6150440	Oh, this is a good question
6150440	6156040	Have you started the agency on its own or did you get any sponsors or investors? Nope
6156520	6165720	So when the agency was becoming an agency, uh, there were actually multiple offers for like split ownership and that kind of thing
6166840	6171960	The last thing I want is anyone meddling with my girls. So absolutely not
6172840	6178040	I rejected them all. I have absolutely no interest in anyone else having
6178600	6181240	Anything to do ownership wise
6181960	6186200	Other than knowing that the girls are in my good hands. Okay
6187640	6193560	Uh, there was also whispers of like, oh, you can sell this this business on if it gets big
6196120	6198120	And let me stop you right there
6199160	6201160	I trust myself for these girls
6201720	6205320	I do not trust anyone else with these girls
6206600	6211160	So thank you for your interest in your acquisition your investment
6212040	6215640	However, if you want to invest, how about you?
6216440	6218440	invest in some
6219640	6221640	merchandise official veal or
6222520	6224520	I'm just rolling with you
6229320	6233080	Uh, why go with patreon over other
6234120	6236120	locations
6236120	6241320	It is safe to link patreon on youtube as long as everything is behind of paywall
6242520	6246440	There is a large established market on patreon
6247400	6253000	If there is ever anything to happen, there are multiple websites that can be utilized in case
6253800	6258040	Please do not worry. Okay. There are many reasons behind
6259320	6264680	Um developmental wise, but I hope it's kind of here
6266440	6268440	a
6268680	6273560	What are your plans for the future of veal or um for me personally
6273640	6279800	It is helping the girls achieve their great dreams. A lot of them were interested in 3d models
6280200	6284280	Um, definitely do that. There's a few that are interested in a few song covers
6284280	6286840	I'll help them pursue that maybe with their own original song
6287480	6293800	But my goals are the girls goals. Um, and if you mean my actual personal goals, I'll talk about that in 2.0
6293800	6300120	But my goals are the girls goals. Yeah, I want to help them be successful and be happy. Um, yeah, good life
6301080	6307480	We'll give you the inspiration to make veal or um corporate greed hate
6309080	6311080	We hate corporate greed
6313080	6315080	That's my sense
6316680	6318440	And
6318440	6322600	I keep seeing people say welcome back. Did you used to be a feature bar before this?
6323720	6325160	Um
6325160	6328680	I'm straw any cuttles. Let's leave it at that. Okay
6329640	6332440	I'm straw any cuttles and I'm very happy to be here
6332600	6336440	And if you're a fan of me, you may like to refer to yourself as a refling
6337240	6342680	And it's a good life. Okay, and thank you guys for being respectful and letting me
6343400	6345400	Let me be straw any
6345400	6347400	much happy
6347800	6354360	Uh petition to name your Celtic alternative your scottl fish out there. Oh, that's really creative
6354440	6360280	Right, sorry. I should have should have read that should have read that as a as a straw. And let's see if there's any questions
6361160	6363160	um
6363640	6367720	I think that's all the agency questions unless of refresh and there's like a billion more. Oh
6368840	6372440	That's a lot more questions. I just came through if I didn't say um
6373160	6375640	We've got 20 minute timer for shibu
6376440	6381320	Shibu de toilet. All right. Sorry. I'm sorry though. If emmy didn't say that
6382280	6387000	If emmy didn't say shibu de toilet, I would never have said that myself. I'm so sorry
6387800	6391800	It was emmy blame emmy. It was emmy. She started it
6392840	6394840	She started it
6396280	6404920	Oh my god, I never even told you the funniest thing. So, uh, we had our like we were together for two months before we debuted
6405640	6411160	And the weirdest thing ever was like, uh instead of like their meetings where like the girls got to know each other
6411400	6415320	I was like, right. Let's go play among us together for the first time
6417720	6424920	Oh, so we were like freaking a zero was absolutely smoking us. So I'm going to recalibrate my little leech ever. Hold on my mic
6426600	6428760	Okay, there we go. My mic's a bit better than my mic
6429720	6433800	Um, yeah, we had to like do forced among like for your game
6434280	6440520	Hey, let me try to say to like make everyone comfortable around each other. Yeah, we played like whiplash
6441320	6447640	Um, this game where like you can I can't remember the title of it, but it was like really good. It was fun
6448360	6450360	um
6454600	6456600	Sorry, I just had a little
6457400	6460200	Jack box that was it. We played like jack box together and stuff
6461000	6462680	um
6462760	6464760	Are the girls free to collab whoever they want?
6465960	6467960	Yes, asterix
6469160	6471160	As long as I've no got a willy
6471640	6474360	I don't care who they collab with we can go nuts for all I care
6475800	6479560	Why are the girls so cute? Is that part of your hypnosis? Have I trained you?
6480280	6482280	Trained you to like the girl
6483800	6489960	Uh, how open to merch suggestions? Are you from fans like design ideas and such go for it? But the
6490760	6493320	You know this this agency's kind of
6495240	6500760	I'm gonna I need to word my words careful word my words carefully. I am I need to word myself carefully
6501480	6503480	but most like
6504360	6508120	I want to say most agencies aren't so open and taking feedback
6508520	6510680	Whereas like I want to say like
6511240	6517320	Hey, we've literally just started. Of course, we're gonna fuck up here and there something's gonna go wrong
6517880	6523480	But like we're open to suggestions like oh, I think this is a good idea. I think that's a good idea
6524520	6526520	You know
6527240	6529240	I want to say that
6531880	6533880	And
6534440	6539480	Someone says do the talents own the games on the steam account. Oh fucking course
6540200	6547080	Did you buy the game surprise surprise you get to keep it very very very hard concept
6547800	6549800	for some people to comprehend but
6550120	6556280	Yeah, the talents if they buy it they keep it crazy concept. I know truly
6557320	6559320	Mindfongling
6560200	6562700	Who came up with mersey's design?
6563880	6567160	Everything is by squishy girl. The website's getting an update
6567240	6572920	It's actually taken quite long to to produce the update because there's quite a lot of information that's going to be in it
6573000	6576440	So give us a hot second to produce that
6577640	6579640	um
6583080	6586680	Supposing that someone has an edit in portfolio, can they apply for a video editor?
6586760	6591640	Yeah, uh clippers editors. Um, I want to try and do a clipping program
6592680	6596920	Where you get money very like idle. I'm not even gonna like say otherwise
6597400	6603240	Adel do a clipping program where if you clip the girl every thousand views you get a dollar type thing
6603560	6610120	I'm quite interested in that style because you're not forced to only clip us you can clip whoever you want on the side
6610680	6612680	and obviously
6612840	6615960	Need a wee bit of money to come back in before I can do something like that
6616120	6620120	But I really do like the concept of it. Very good. Very nice. Very good
6621960	6623960	Um, I like it very much
6623960	6625960	Uh
6635640	6641240	Sorry, I'm just I'm just reading some of the questions. I can't say it loud as I read it because it's you know
6642680	6644680	Um
6646440	6648440	Sorry, I'm reading I'm reading just in case
6650760	6652760	Uh
6652840	6657000	Hold on. Hold on. I'm reading. I'm reading. I'm reading. You guys are just saying inappropriate stuff about
6657720	6659720	sorry the guy the the talent the
6660280	6661720	comments are like
6661720	6664360	I would do this to ac I would do this to emi and I'm like
6665080	6667080	But that's not a question about the agency
6669400	6675240	How long did it take to get the hired selection progress process? Oh my god
6676440	6678920	Oh my god, you've just activated my neurons
6679880	6685640	So the the application pool was open for a month
6687080	6693320	And then the way the twitter said like in 48 hours or something you're gonna get an email
6694040	6700680	And someone was like, oh my god, there's no way they're gonna go through all those applications in two days
6701240	6703240	No, you idiot
6703800	6704840	You
6704840	6710040	Numpty of course we were going through the applications as they came in
6711480	6713480	You genuinely thought
6714440	6718280	That when they close is when agencies go through them
6720120	6722120	Come on
6722440	6724940	Rub those brain cells together
6727960	6730760	You genuinely think that agencies
6731400	6735160	Close applications and then start going through them. No
6736200	6740280	I had a freaking battle royale tier system going on for the girls
6741160	6743160	goodness gravy
6744520	6752200	Goodness gravy some of the comments come on me. I'm no very smart myself, but the moon man you're taking my pass
6753400	6758440	Uh, are there rules surrounding clipping the talents? Absolutely not go nuts knock yourself out
6758520	6761480	Thank you because it costs a lot to pay for clipping
6762760	6768600	Um, will you ever hire programmers sadly? I don't need a programmer. It's just fix
6770440	6772440	Hey
6774200	6778520	Battle royale tier system. Okay, right. I can to you can talk about this
6778920	6783080	So as the applications came in if I found a girl that was suitable
6783960	6785960	I would pick out the model for you
6786760	6789880	And there was first place second place third place
6790680	6792040	but
6792040	6798680	The choices were so like obvious to me if it made sense like
6799240	6805720	Emmy was Emmy. I see was I see, you know, like the choices were so obvious that it was like do the interview
6806760	6813400	And you're in type thing. Uh, I have a no bullshit apology. I have a no bullshit approach to interviews
6813720	6817480	So and the girls can talk about it if they so desire. I basically
6818280	6820280	Went into the interview with them and I said
6821160	6823160	Right off the bat. I said, hey
6823240	6827160	We want you as a talent. You absolutely do not have to impress me in this call
6827640	6830760	Okay, you don't have to impress me. I want you already
6831080	6835880	Here's a list of stuff that you need to know before you sign on if you want to sign on. Okay
6837160	6842520	Did you have a lot of candidates for fondlet? No, Azura was the only like there was no one else for Azura
6842520	6847320	If Zura rejected that position. I was up shit creek. I'm not even fucking saying nothing
6848920	6850920	Yeah
6851240	6853240	angry scottish is more
6854600	6856360	um
6856360	6858360	but yeah, uh
6858520	6862760	Within like 24 hours people were emailed and that was it
6867480	6871400	Are you going are your models gonna stick? Oh, sorry. Are you in the
6871960	6873960	Models stick to these avatar
6874200	6875800	Hey
6875800	6882200	You mean like new outfits and stuff now the girls can get new outfits or 2.0 or whatever or 3d models perfectly fine with me
6884360	6886360	Um
6887560	6889560	Uh
6890280	6896600	Are you ever worried about your relationship with the girls considering your gen mates and a boss funny you mentioned that I told them
6897240	6899240	in the interview
6899640	6904120	Don't call me boss. Don't refer to me as your boss. Do not think of me as your boss
6904600	6906200	I am not your boss
6906200	6911400	Don't ever place me above you mentally in your head. I do not want that
6912040	6914040	I am the creative director
6914600	6916600	wink wink
6916680	6920040	So they do not call me boss. They do not call me superior
6920760	6926040	Yes, she V called me boss ma'am and I was like no, please don't ever
6926600	6932680	Like do that because I don't want anyone thinking in their head like oh my god. I can't approach her. I can't talk to her
6934200	6936200	No, I don't want that
6936840	6938840	I don't like them
6938840	6944520	I don't want anyone to ever think that I am superior to them in any way unless it's their kink
6946120	6948680	I said it I said it
6950600	6952600	Um
6956200	6958200	Let me check let me
6961320	6962200	Um
6962200	6965320	Also at the end of the day, I'm not really a boss anymore
6965480	6968680	Like now that debuts are over everything's like up to the girl
6969240	6973800	The only boss thing really is like hey, have you recorded that?
6974440	6977720	Audio for patreon. Yes or no, and then that's it
6979000	6981000	There's nothing else to it
6981240	6983240	Um
6986760	6988760	So yeah leader
6989080	6993400	Yeah, uh, basically just tell them like hey, I did this and I'll show them stats and stuff
6993400	6995400	And I'm like this is what I think you should do
6995800	6997800	but they don't really ask for advice because
6998280	7000280	Uh, I'll mention I'll repeat this again
7000680	7003480	All the girls have more streaming experience than me
7003800	7010280	So it's really hypocritical for me to be like hey go stream this go stream that no I have full faith in these girls
7010680	7016040	Uh, they are absolutely fantastic. They're lovely everything. I have absolutely no problems
7016280	7022040	I have complete faith in them and absolutely nothing is worrisome at all. So
7022920	7024920	Yeah
7029640	7031160	She goes live in eight minutes
7031160	7036520	Hold on let me get confirmation that I raid into she be's 2.0

7042440	7044440	Please absolutely do
7045080	7049640	Uh, I will also be doing my 2.0 at the exact same time, but I am in uh
7050680	7053640	I highly recommend you do she burs she sturs
7054440	7059000	um because she is nothing but an angel and uh
7060120	7065720	I would love you to support my daughters over me. This is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
7066920	7073560	What's my 2.0? I'm I'm gonna answer questions about myself and stuff, but this is kind of more agency focus
7074120	7076120	Yeah
7076680	7078440	Um
7078440	7081560	Someone asked do you have plans for auditions for gen 2?
7082680	7084200	My guy
7084200	7086200	We debuted yesterday
7086200	7091960	Unless you're actually interested in joining the agency that's different. Um the
7092600	7094600	We were a year away from
7095480	7099640	My focus is on helping these girls achieve their dreams and seeing where we go
7100680	7104840	You know, you need to let let they've literally just been birthed from my lines
7104920	7110120	Give them a chance to like, you know get their their knee joints working and all that jazz
7112360	7116440	Yeah, let's everyone cook first, but it's it's a year away. Um, that we're
7118200	7120200	Yeah
7125400	7127400	That's
7128360	7130760	Okay, any questions on youtube because
7132120	7137080	Marshmallow drying up like my voice box. Honestly, whose voice is it?
7141320	7147960	You've invested a lot of money into this understand that the marriage goes to the girls, but how exactly do you recoup your investment?
7149080	7150840	me
7150840	7153240	I keep 100% of what I
7155320	7156920	Uh
7156920	7163160	Don't worry about like thank you very much for worrying about investment costs and stuff, but like this this is big
7163880	7166520	This is again, not for greed
7167160	7171800	This is for me to do my thing and I have five lovely girls who I also recommend
7172440	7174600	And I want them to be able to do their thing
7176040	7178040	And yeah
7178200	7183240	Let them cook man. I'll cook don't don't worry about the money. Okay. Don't worry about the money some things in life are
7183800	7185560	more important than
7185560	7186600	great
7186600	7193480	And I don't mean you're implying that I'm greedy because obviously everyone wants to return on investment if you will but
7194360	7197480	Let's just have a good time. Like I'm playing Assassin's Creed tomorrow
7197880	7200600	I'm going to tell you about that some of the developmental lore of that game
7200920	7206680	I'm going to tell you a little tip bits about glitches that occur in that game. I'm just here for a good time
7207240	7209240	Okay
7210280	7212120	Uh
7212120	7215320	When was velar started? Uh, it's been a one year
7216600	7221160	Development. Uh, actually I'm going to give you the name of the song the girls were
7221800	7225640	Uh, I was the girls were concepted. Oh god. Was it?
7237480	7242120	All right, this is the song. Sorry. I just completely went off in my head
7242840	7246440	This is the song the girls, uh, were birthed to
7247320	7249320	one year ago
7249880	7253720	This song so open that up in a oh should be started
7255560	7261480	Is we cheaper start is to be cheaper started. Okay. Okay. Are there any games that can't be played?
7262280	7264280	Uh
7264520	7267480	For legal reason? No
7269240	7271400	Because we're not a Japanese based company
7271720	7278200	We don't have to worry about that copyright shit that other agencies are like fucking tied to
7279000	7281000	It's not a rec roll
