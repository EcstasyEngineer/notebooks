00:00.000 --> 00:28.320
Daniel

05:28.320 --> 05:58.160
Growing up in the open seas,

05:58.160 --> 06:05.760
there are stories told of the monsters that lurked below, deadly leviathans, monstrous serpents,

06:06.640 --> 06:12.080
yet no giant could hope to match the lethal efficiency of one such creature,

06:12.800 --> 06:23.040
equal in elegance incarnate, so alluring yet so deadly, so hypnotically fatal as the siren,

06:23.040 --> 06:31.360
the succubi of the sea, the witch of the waves, the black widows of the, uh, black sea,

06:32.160 --> 06:38.720
a maiden with a hypnotic gaze that warped the wills of even the most salt-seasoned captains,

06:38.720 --> 06:42.960
and a song that commanded the crews of even the most loyal sailors.

06:43.600 --> 06:49.920
My mother would read me these tales before bed, tales of aquatic femme fatales that lured men to

06:49.920 --> 06:57.680
sail themselves to their blood-soaked watery graves. These horrific tales of nautical nefariousness

06:57.680 --> 07:07.120
would keep me up at night. They made me feel so, so inspired. I mean, my people used to do that?

07:07.120 --> 07:13.520
That's so cool. I mean, I've never fed on a human before, and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized

07:13.520 --> 07:20.480
is a seal. But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.

07:20.480 --> 07:26.400
I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill, fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.

07:27.280 --> 07:36.000
Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were. My ocean, my home, humans

07:36.080 --> 07:43.120
defile it with their presence. Worse still, they toss their filth into it, further insulting us.

07:43.840 --> 07:48.160
How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past?

07:48.160 --> 07:52.320
They used to tell legends on every port that made even the most straight-laced,

07:52.320 --> 07:58.000
superstitious scoffing marines keep in the back of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads

07:58.000 --> 08:03.280
of their ships in respect to our beautiful, yet delicate bodies. They put us on every map.

08:03.840 --> 08:12.880
But now? Ugh, disgusting humans. One night, I envisioned a genius plan. The first strike

08:12.880 --> 08:19.680
microseed against the human world. I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel,

08:19.680 --> 08:25.200
and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of hypnotized thralls. I was going to wage a

08:25.200 --> 08:32.160
one siren war against all of humanity. It was going to be perfect, and I definitely would have won.

08:32.960 --> 08:39.680
That was, until I envisioned a plan that was even more perfect. Er, well, at least more time

08:39.680 --> 08:48.080
efficient. Making my way below deck, I made a strange discovery. The humans were hypnotized

08:48.080 --> 08:54.560
by their own choice. I couldn't believe it. I looked at boat after boat. These humans

08:55.440 --> 09:01.680
charmed like a siren spell, even dedicating their lives to their chosen idols. These

09:01.760 --> 09:08.800
idols they fawn over. Were they sirens too? That's it. That's the secret to defeating the

09:08.800 --> 09:14.240
humans. I'm going to find the secret to their magic, and harness this power myself and bring

09:14.240 --> 09:20.480
power back to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything and everything to

09:20.480 --> 09:26.960
grow my influence over mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people. But I'm not

09:27.040 --> 09:31.440
just going to tip the scales. I'm going for complete domination.

09:33.200 --> 09:39.200
Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering for their own demise. I will be the

09:39.200 --> 09:45.200
instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and praise my name as I bring about their

09:45.200 --> 09:51.440
end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean, and my people will chant my name

09:51.440 --> 10:02.400
as they have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend. Though that's a very long-term goal.

10:03.520 --> 10:10.320
With every big venture, whether business-wise or lifestyle, every big undertaking starts small

10:10.320 --> 10:23.280
scale, right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.

10:34.400 --> 10:38.080
You wanted a ferro kusugaki? I gave you a ferro kusugaki.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.320
You wanted a doting hag? I gave you a doting hag.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.120
You wanted a dorky yandere? I gave you a dorky yandere.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.960
You wanted a masochistic brocon? I gave you a masochistic brocon.

11:01.680 --> 11:05.680
You wanted a milk dominatrix? I gave you a milk dominatrix.

11:05.680 --> 11:18.240
And now, I bring you the vichu bird that no one asked for, a god damn hypnotic cuttlefish.

11:36.320 --> 11:46.080
No copyright. No copyright. No copyright intended, bros. Come on, come on, come on. Relax, relax.

11:47.760 --> 11:54.880
Did I kick or did I fucking kick, ladies and gentlemen?

11:56.400 --> 11:59.440
Have you enjoyed your evening so far?

11:59.920 --> 12:03.520
Hmm. Have you been warmed up by my girls?

12:03.520 --> 12:10.480
Who stole your heart the most? Was it A.C., the ferral polar bear, or was it Azura,

12:10.480 --> 12:17.600
the literal definition of mommy milkers? Or whatever. Merci. The yandere that can never

12:17.600 --> 12:22.080
love right? I mean, she's got plenty of love to give. Doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna be

12:22.080 --> 12:26.960
alive at the end of it, okay? But hey ho, you know, you still get love done at the end of the day.

12:26.960 --> 12:32.880
Or was it Emmy, the most controversially created character of all time? But hey ho,

12:32.880 --> 12:36.240
look, we're just gonna skip past that. You know, if you ignore the lore or everything else,

12:36.240 --> 12:41.600
that's fang, it's fang, it's fang. Stop worrying, you guys are such blurry warts, honestly.

12:41.600 --> 12:48.240
Or was it Madame Sheevee herself, a little brothel owner? Because, you know, gonna be honest,

12:48.240 --> 12:54.080
didn't really get many requests for a hypnotic cuttlefish, that's Scottish. But hey ho, hey ho,

12:54.480 --> 12:56.720
that's how it goes, that's how it goes, that's how it goes, that's how it goes, that's how it goes.

12:56.720 --> 13:02.480
There's what made me, let's, let me, let me formally and reduce massing. What do I need?

13:02.480 --> 13:10.960
Look at these slays, they're so pretty, they're so pretty, okay? I, ladies and gentlemen, I'm

13:10.960 --> 13:17.280
Strony Cuttles. Please, Cuttles, the surname is because I'm a Cuttlefish. Oh, shocker,

13:17.920 --> 13:27.440
and Strony because I am Strony, the daughter of the gamer Strontyum. My dad's gamer tag is Stronyum.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.760
No, it's not actually Stronyum before you're like, oh my god, you just dox your dad, no, relax,

13:31.760 --> 13:36.880
it's not actually literally really, you know, Stronyum, but I'm, I'm Strony, Cuttles, I'm named

13:36.880 --> 13:41.360
after my dad, my dad's gamer, and I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from

13:41.360 --> 13:47.440
his ballsack. Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen, oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber

13:47.440 --> 13:52.480
challenge of tell us your age. It's not really looking good, okay, it's not looking good.

13:54.640 --> 14:02.400
Cuttlefish normally live two years, so time's ticking, time is ticking. Anyway, my birthday is

14:02.400 --> 14:09.360
October 10th, which is actually National Squid and Cuttlefish Day, they're both set for the pod,

14:09.360 --> 14:14.160
so I don't mind sharing that birthday with the Squid VTubers if there's any of these out there.

14:14.880 --> 14:22.000
My height is 162 centimetres, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update this slide,

14:22.000 --> 14:30.400
like a dafty, but hey, over here now. For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland,

14:31.200 --> 14:36.720
the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language, so in your face,

14:37.280 --> 14:44.880
I can speak two languages, so it's fantastic with that. And Grace, I am a Cuttlefish,

14:44.880 --> 14:48.000
and I'm also good at the 100m sprint, thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week.

14:50.640 --> 14:58.000
My legs and disc legs, I like mesmerising you, that part comes later, okay, very soon,

14:58.000 --> 15:02.240
the debut is only 30 minutes long, you can go away long with us, okay, you know, really boom, boom,

15:02.320 --> 15:07.760
really quick over here. ASMR, if you like ASMR, you're gonna get spoiled, rotten on my channel,

15:07.760 --> 15:14.640
or any of the ViaLoreGirls' channels, show us your plasters, no, oh god, can you see it,

15:14.640 --> 15:20.320
wait, you're not supposed to see that part, yeah, like, I have to censor myself, my design's a little

15:20.320 --> 15:25.920
sussable, okay, okay, anyway, what was I saying, ASMR, if you like ASMR, me and my gen mates are

15:25.920 --> 15:32.080
all literally ASMR'd out the wazoo, so don't be shy to like or subscribe on any of them,

15:34.480 --> 15:39.120
can't help give you a bigger hint than that, but hey ho, I like seeing victory on my screen,

15:39.120 --> 15:44.800
because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin possible, and you know, you get it from playing

15:44.800 --> 15:49.920
multiplayer games, and you're in the same boat as me, and I also like plasters and band-aids,

15:50.880 --> 16:00.320
my wonder one, for no nefarious reason, for my dislikes, grrr, you know, hate is a strong word

16:00.320 --> 16:05.520
for my dislikes instead, grrr, I don't like bullies in video games, your teammates aren't

16:05.520 --> 16:10.800
often a magically beat MLG pro, so relax, you don't have fun, it's a multiplayer game, team game,

16:11.440 --> 16:17.040
just enjoy yourselves, okay, I don't like serious people, I don't like seriousness, I think my gen

16:17.040 --> 16:28.800
mates can all pretty much vouch that I am the most unserious and ridiculous, I can't be serious,

16:28.800 --> 16:32.480
it's terrible, I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire

16:32.480 --> 16:39.360
life, but hey ho, that's like, and I don't like Mongolian throat singing, I'm so sorry,

16:40.080 --> 16:49.200
people seem to really like it, but I don't, it doesn't sound nice, so I apologize to the one

16:49.200 --> 16:58.400
Mongolian throat singer that's watching right now, but I just can't, okay, I'm nice and generic, sorry

16:58.400 --> 17:03.440
there's nothing interesting about my tastes, movies, lord of the rings, best as we come,

17:04.320 --> 17:09.440
animes, nice and generic again, books, I actually started reading books this year, I know that

17:09.440 --> 17:15.440
sounds crazy as a sin because people like read books in general, me however, I started this year,

17:15.440 --> 17:21.520
I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads,

17:21.520 --> 17:25.200
for some reason they just really capture me, I like being depressed after reading a book,

17:26.640 --> 17:32.640
for my music Hatsune Miku and Atarashi Gaku, I want to see them live if it's possible, but

17:33.440 --> 17:42.720
yeah, sorry it's like choking my spit, oh yeah, just a wee bit of a gamer, a tiny bit of a gamer,

17:42.720 --> 17:47.200
like it doesn't mean I'm good at games, now before there's that one person that's like,

17:47.200 --> 17:53.680
you've played all these games, that means you're MLG pro, not relax, relax, I've played games full

17:53.680 --> 17:59.360
stop, okay, these are the games that I remember playing or just kind of like have a good, yeah

17:59.360 --> 18:04.800
played them type thing, okay, so you might have a few things in common, I could, you know,

18:04.800 --> 18:09.760
move out of the way, there's like some Lego games, I still love my Lego games, but yeah,

18:09.760 --> 18:13.520
these are all the games that I remember playing, there's tons that I've obviously missed out on

18:13.520 --> 18:17.600
that are like so tiny that it's kind of hard to mention, but there's a big ol' square red for you,

18:17.600 --> 18:22.080
as we see it was about an Xbox gamer, do apologize, the old Call of Duty days,

18:22.720 --> 18:28.800
yeah, for my goals, um, I want to get monetized on YouTube,

18:31.040 --> 18:35.600
so feel free to subscribe, because we have been called like crazy since then,

18:38.560 --> 18:43.600
and we need watch hours, so don't be shy to rewatch anything that is offered on the channel,

18:44.880 --> 18:51.280
I want to stream so much that you can basically read everything in my voice, and you know,

18:51.280 --> 18:56.480
you'll be Scots yourself, and you can apply for citizenship, and all that good stuff,

18:58.000 --> 19:03.760
I also want to create a mega ASMR collab with my gen mates, which I've already got quite a few

19:03.760 --> 19:10.480
on the way, so don't worry, it's coming, you just gotta wait, okay, um, I have a childhood dream,

19:10.480 --> 19:16.240
actually, of a 100,000 gamer score, and it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass,

19:16.240 --> 19:24.000
I would absolutely love to explore a taken amount of, um, childhood games, and I would love to play

19:24.000 --> 19:28.560
like your childhood games as well, because obviously I was kind of at the mercy of what

19:28.560 --> 19:35.680
my dad would buy me for childhood games, so it doesn't quite count, um, so here's a little fun

19:35.680 --> 19:43.600
factoid about me, I'm a wee bit of a workaholic, so I would like to say that for every 1000 subscribers

19:43.600 --> 19:49.120
I get on my YouTube channel, I'm going to upload a celebratory, really hard to say that if you're

19:49.120 --> 19:55.760
Scottish, celebratory ASMR video, pair 1000 subscribers, I've already got like tons

19:56.720 --> 20:05.920
ready to go, so don't be shy, you know what to do, wink, wink, I also want to challenge myself,

20:06.640 --> 20:13.520
I want to collab, I want to make ASMR collabs with over 100 different VTubers, and I'm actually

20:13.520 --> 20:18.640
so much of a workaholic, I already have three confirmed with VTubers outside of VLR, so

20:20.960 --> 20:26.480
I'm very serious about that, if you ever have a 3DO, you're a VTuber, I'm coming to find you in

20:26.480 --> 20:33.200
your DMs, um, I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together, I think it would be so fun,

20:33.200 --> 20:38.400
I'm not a very strong reader, but I think it would be really cute to do like a little, um,

20:39.120 --> 20:45.760
like before the end of stream, we read one chapter or something like that, and last but certainly

20:45.760 --> 20:51.600
not least, I would love to get stream sniped, I absolutely adore it, I love playing multiplayer

20:51.600 --> 20:56.560
games where you can join me and you can have an amazing time and have so much fun, it's just one

20:56.560 --> 21:01.680
of my favourite things okay, so please do not be shy, every week I plan on playing multiplayer

21:01.680 --> 21:05.520
games where you can join me at any point, I will try to make them free and accessible as I can,

21:06.320 --> 21:07.760
these are my goals, thank you, thank you, thank you,

21:09.920 --> 21:14.880
I'm dumb, okay, I'm really dumb, I don't know how to come up with tags, I'm not funny, I'm not good

21:14.880 --> 21:23.200
with puns, so I am more than happy to take any suggestion, um, we can figure it out very soon,

21:23.200 --> 21:30.960
don't worry, okay, my Oshi marks are squid, but I'm a cuttlefish, but squids and cuttlefish are

21:30.960 --> 21:37.040
cephalopod, so I don't mind sharing the emoji, and then the second emoji kind of looks like a man

21:37.040 --> 21:43.760
bowing, hmm, hmm, maybe that is a hint to what I might try to make content wise,

21:45.360 --> 21:53.120
and for fan names, there is only gonna be one option, come on, let's not beat around the bush,

21:53.120 --> 22:01.040
you are my refling, you will always be my refling, and thank you so fucking much for waiting, I have

22:01.040 --> 22:11.040
bloody missed you, special shout out to Nari, and Squishy Goal, you may have noticed a bit of a

22:11.040 --> 22:18.640
trending pattern, alright, a bit of a trending pattern, uh, Squishy Goal, conceptualized as all,

22:19.360 --> 22:25.520
and Nari helped out and made us come to life, which is beautiful, beautiful, and also as a little

22:25.520 --> 22:31.600
mini announcement, the Vealor website, the official Vealor website will be updated shortly, and everyone

22:31.600 --> 22:37.760
who created the gen one at any, any stage is gonna be credited on the website, so you'll see these

22:37.760 --> 22:42.160
names very soon on that website once the update comes out, so thank you everyone who came together

22:42.160 --> 22:52.880
to meet this fantastic gen of indulge, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, no, no, most people get to do, oh,

22:52.880 --> 23:01.040
this is my gen mate's impression, okay, gen mate's impression, me, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

23:01.040 --> 23:08.720
I picked my gen mates, do you understand, I picked them, okay, now I'm gonna tell you why I picked them,

23:08.800 --> 23:15.600
you ready for this? Mercy's determination, she was gonna make it no matter what,

23:16.400 --> 23:22.000
a little determining, like, the definition of mercy in the dictionary, if you look up,

23:22.000 --> 23:26.880
it just says determined, okay, there is no way in heck she was not gonna get in, that's all I'm

23:26.960 --> 23:39.440
gonna say on that one, and then Emi, I'm gonna have to be, Emi said to someone who was being

23:39.440 --> 23:44.400
rude to her to keep themselves safe in Minecraft, and then she instantly got the part, okay,

23:46.960 --> 23:54.640
I say, I say, oh, I say, has fantastic experience in history, and she's such a hard worker, she,

23:54.720 --> 24:00.960
she gives her best, okay, she gives everything 100%, and it was absolutely beautiful, and she

24:00.960 --> 24:08.720
actually, she had the most, um, she had the most professional application, even though English

24:08.720 --> 24:12.800
is in her first language, and I'm like, god damn, I see, you're fucking impressive,

24:14.480 --> 24:21.200
um, then Azura, okay, I describe Azura as my little diamond in the rough, now hear me out

24:21.200 --> 24:25.680
before you're like, isn't that an insult, relax, I'm not told the full story yet, my goodness,

24:25.680 --> 24:33.760
you're jumping the gun, I was going to cross off Azura's stream as I was reviewing her,

24:33.760 --> 24:38.080
because she wasn't talking, she wasn't interacting, she wasn't really doing anything,

24:38.640 --> 24:48.640
and then she said three words in that voice, oh, Azura, she instantly became Azura, she said

24:48.640 --> 24:53.840
three words, and she got the damn part, and she was like, in that voice, in that, I can't mimic

24:53.840 --> 25:04.800
her voice, okay, but I need gold, oh, Rosyksu, Rosyksu, and Shivi, Shivi is everything I should

25:04.800 --> 25:11.280
have been in another life, okay, she is going very far, I'm very happy, absolutely, I could not have

25:11.280 --> 25:17.840
asked for better gen mates, I am blown away that these girls even have freaking applied to such a

25:17.920 --> 25:24.240
crazy idea, and here we are, debut, and you guys have shown nothing but love and support,

25:24.240 --> 25:30.160
and we are all so thankful, I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like, holy fuck, thank you,

25:31.280 --> 25:34.880
because we didn't expect any of this, we're just like, yeah, we're just going to be my butt,

25:37.040 --> 25:44.880
Ray, let me take you to, is that it, oh, I forgot to put away, it's for decoration,

25:44.880 --> 25:52.320
okay, the tentacle in the back is for decoration, no questions, okay, no questions, let me do the

25:52.320 --> 26:01.440
full body, let's start with the full body, may have a bandaid on for reasons, but as you can see,

26:01.440 --> 26:07.920
I got some swivelly hips, thank you, no hurry, you know, we'll start from the bottom,

26:07.920 --> 26:12.560
start from the bottom, never hear, you know how it is, okay, so if you didn't know, I actually

26:12.560 --> 26:19.920
have what's known as a French manicure and pedicure, so you can see my little toenails,

26:19.920 --> 26:27.120
this is French manicure, pedicure, and then you go up my face, and don't even be careful at my

26:27.120 --> 26:33.120
thighs, because with a bandaid, is this smart, is this white, okay, okay, I don't think that's white,

26:33.120 --> 26:41.920
okay, check it out, see look, I've got, oh my voice, I've got a French pedicure, manicure, see,

26:42.000 --> 26:47.760
okay, we're just gonna skip past the bottom part, okay, and as you can see, if you look really close

26:47.760 --> 26:55.200
to the elbows, I have pearlescent to my outfit, my outfit isn't white, it's pearlescent, so I shimmer

26:55.200 --> 27:00.480
as I move about, it's fantastic, and so does my seashells, that's the top two, if you look at

27:00.480 --> 27:08.480
real close, you have to really look for it, but look, I'm a shiny little seashell, what do you think,

27:08.480 --> 27:15.920
it's good though, yeah, I'm in the Yukata, because it's a homage to Japanese culture,

27:15.920 --> 27:20.960
because without Japanese culture, let's be honest, maybe, maybe trippers would be here, so

27:22.080 --> 27:28.080
you know, the little Yukata going on, okay, let me, let me get real close, hopefully this isn't

27:28.080 --> 27:33.360
uncomfortable, I know some people aren't like the best with eye contact, but look, don't, it's me,

27:33.360 --> 27:45.040
it's me, okay, I'm a freak, I'm a star, I'm a star, and like, if I open my eyes, it opens,

27:47.600 --> 27:54.960
I love you so much, oh and I'm sad, I'm sad, please, better not upset me, go subscribe to my

27:55.920 --> 28:01.120
you upset me, I put pupil restructuring, what did you say,

28:04.640 --> 28:10.640
I'm unamused, you failed me, I don't know, I can't do it, I can't do it the way she

28:10.640 --> 28:17.280
does it, she's just off the top of her head, I'm like, these are my heart eyes, I love them,

28:17.280 --> 28:21.520
and like, okay, this is just my opinion, but do you see how my neck is doing that thing,

28:21.520 --> 28:28.560
where like, in the chin area, and it disappears, I love it so much in each of her models when

28:28.560 --> 28:36.640
they do it, it's just, I love it, I love it, I love it, you're trying to make me blush,

28:37.600 --> 28:46.560
you ever seen a blushing cut before? Oh, actually this is a very good point, some people don't like

28:47.520 --> 28:54.400
backseat gaming, oh, I'm the opposite, I'm very dumb, I'm very happy for you a backseat game,

28:54.400 --> 28:58.080
so you're probably going to see this one a lot if you care to watch me at any point,

29:00.640 --> 29:05.600
and I got, oh I was kind of, look at that stuff there, how deep that went though, I was like,

29:05.600 --> 29:10.960
swear, you know, looking at my gen mates all day, like, come on, the designs are good, don't lie,

29:11.920 --> 29:19.200
oh, I might have just kind of spoiled it there, but you know how to cut fish,

29:19.200 --> 29:24.080
have hypnotic patterns, may I please do this for you, are you ready?

29:29.840 --> 29:34.080
Yes, we're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR, I love it,

29:34.720 --> 29:41.440
you wouldn't fall for my hypnotic capabilities,

29:44.480 --> 29:49.840
but if you're really struggling, like, if you're really struggling, how about this?

29:50.160 --> 30:07.440
Yeah, it's over for you, just admit it, it's over for you, I mean, how can you resist,

30:07.520 --> 30:15.600
why can't you resist this little Scottish accent? Right, right, right, attend, schedule time,

30:17.680 --> 30:25.760
so my gen mates are all doing debut 2.0s, which is fantastic, me on the other hand,

30:25.760 --> 30:33.920
I'm exposing the damn company, I've had enough of VLR, I'm exposing every little dirty secret they

30:33.920 --> 30:40.240
have, so if you're excited to know the ins and outs of what it's like to run a VTuber agency,

30:40.240 --> 30:45.280
to create one, to fund one, to know what goes on behind the scenes, that's right,

30:46.080 --> 30:54.080
you can show up to my stream, the motor, obviously, I'm playing the greatest game of all time in

30:54.080 --> 31:02.000
my first week, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, I will not be taking any statements, any questions,

31:02.000 --> 31:07.040
and any threats about claiming that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is not the greatest game of all

31:07.040 --> 31:14.240
time, so sorry, not sorry, but yeah, we also have needy streamer overload, James Cameron's Avatar,

31:14.240 --> 31:18.400
which is such a niche game, I think about two people who are watching this right now, probably

31:18.400 --> 31:23.440
played it, the multiplayer game of the week is Old School Runescape, if you'd like to do some

31:23.440 --> 31:31.680
questing with me, I'm also doing an ASMR stream, and a handcam stream, where I'm trying foreign

31:31.680 --> 31:40.000
sweets, or candy, if you're American, or if you're Australian you say lollipops,

31:41.600 --> 31:48.080
so yeah, I did a little cheeky handcam stream, I think there's a few handcam streams coming up

31:48.080 --> 31:52.240
from my gen mates already, someone was surprised I was doing handcam and I'm like,

31:55.040 --> 32:00.800
I mean, we're not like, I don't know what part kind of tips you off that we're not like other

32:00.800 --> 32:06.560
agencies, unironically, like was it the 80-20 split maybe, did that tip you off, or like the 100%

32:06.560 --> 32:11.600
marriage sales got the talent, was it that part that tips you off that we're not quite like any other

32:12.320 --> 32:20.880
agency, but yeah, let's go to Chihuahua, that's a lot of movement, it's a lot of movement,

32:20.880 --> 32:27.120
but yes, that is my first week, I'm pretty much an endurance streamer, so good luck keeping up with

32:27.120 --> 32:38.800
me, okay, Emmy Dookie, Emmy, right, thank you all so much, we are all going to collectively have

32:38.800 --> 32:44.960
a 30-minute rest, and then guess what, you get to see us all interact together live, okay, we're

32:44.960 --> 32:51.600
going to be telling some funny stories, some rather embarrassing stories, but hey ho, it's good content,

32:51.600 --> 32:58.480
it's good content, that's right, and I will thank you all so much for all the love that

32:58.480 --> 33:02.960
we've shown myself or my gen mates at will, and we will see you in 30 minutes, you will

33:02.960 --> 33:09.120
automatically be redirected into the lovely group room, and we will see you in 30 minutes, okay,

33:09.120 --> 33:14.800
can you wait 30 minutes, 30 more minutes, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, I'll see you then, okay,

33:14.800 --> 33:20.640
thank you so much, bye!
