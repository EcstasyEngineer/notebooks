00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,320
Daniel

2
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:58,160
Growing up in the open seas,

3
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,760
there are stories told of the monsters that lurked below, deadly leviathans, monstrous serpents,

4
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,080
yet no giant could hope to match the lethal efficiency of one such creature,

5
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:23,040
equal in elegance incarnate, so alluring yet so deadly, so hypnotically fatal as the siren,

6
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:31,360
the succubi of the sea, the witch of the waves, the black widows of the, uh, black sea,

7
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,720
a maiden with a hypnotic gaze that warped the wills of even the most salt-seasoned captains,

8
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,960
and a song that commanded the crews of even the most loyal sailors.

9
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,920
My mother would read me these tales before bed, tales of aquatic femme fatales that lured men to

10
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:57,680
sail themselves to their blood-soaked watery graves. These horrific tales of nautical nefariousness

11
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:07,120
would keep me up at night. They made me feel so, so inspired. I mean, my people used to do that?

12
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,520
That's so cool. I mean, I've never fed on a human before, and the smartest thing I've ever hypnotized

13
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,480
is a seal. But learning that my ancestors used to eat humans by the literal boatloads was amazing.

14
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,400
I couldn't wait to grow up and eat my fill, fat ones, tall ones, skinny ones, even hairy ones.

15
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:36,000
Though I learned our people aren't as feared by humans as they once were. My ocean, my home, humans

16
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:43,120
defile it with their presence. Worse still, they toss their filth into it, further insulting us.

17
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,160
How could this have happened? How were we brought so low from our past?

18
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,320
They used to tell legends on every port that made even the most straight-laced,

19
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,000
superstitious scoffing marines keep in the back of their minds. They would dedicate figureheads

20
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,280
of their ships in respect to our beautiful, yet delicate bodies. They put us on every map.

21
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:12,880
But now? Ugh, disgusting humans. One night, I envisioned a genius plan. The first strike

22
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,680
microseed against the human world. I would infiltrate in hijack a fishing vessel,

23
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,200
and use it as my own pirate vessel with a crew of hypnotized thralls. I was going to wage a

24
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:32,160
one siren war against all of humanity. It was going to be perfect, and I definitely would have won.

25
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,680
That was, until I envisioned a plan that was even more perfect. Er, well, at least more time

26
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:48,080
efficient. Making my way below deck, I made a strange discovery. The humans were hypnotized

27
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,560
by their own choice. I couldn't believe it. I looked at boat after boat. These humans

28
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,680
charmed like a siren spell, even dedicating their lives to their chosen idols. These

29
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,800
idols they fawn over. Were they sirens too? That's it. That's the secret to defeating the

30
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,240
humans. I'm going to find the secret to their magic, and harness this power myself and bring

31
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,480
power back to my people. I must gather fame, fortune, scandals, anything and everything to

32
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,960
grow my influence over mankind to bring sirens back into the minds of the people. But I'm not

33
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,440
just going to tip the scales. I'm going for complete domination.

34
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Every human will bend to my will. All will be cheering for their own demise. I will be the

35
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,200
instrument of karmic justice. The world will worship me and praise my name as I bring about their

36
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,440
end. I will march every human under my control into the ocean, and my people will chant my name

37
00:09:51,440 --> 00:10:02,400
as they have a feeding frenzy that has written into legend. Though that's a very long-term goal.

38
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,320
With every big venture, whether business-wise or lifestyle, every big undertaking starts small

39
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:23,280
scale, right? Hmm. So, I think I'll start with you.

40
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,080
You wanted a ferro kusugaki? I gave you a ferro kusugaki.

41
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,320
You wanted a doting hag? I gave you a doting hag.

42
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,120
You wanted a dorky yandere? I gave you a dorky yandere.

43
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,960
You wanted a masochistic brocon? I gave you a masochistic brocon.

44
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
You wanted a milk dominatrix? I gave you a milk dominatrix.

45
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:18,240
And now, I bring you the vichu bird that no one asked for, a god damn hypnotic cuttlefish.

46
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:46,080
No copyright. No copyright. No copyright intended, bros. Come on, come on, come on. Relax, relax.

47
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,880
Did I kick or did I fucking kick, ladies and gentlemen?

48
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,440
Have you enjoyed your evening so far?

49
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,520
Hmm. Have you been warmed up by my girls?

50
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:10,480
Who stole your heart the most? Was it A.C., the ferral polar bear, or was it Azura,

51
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,600
the literal definition of mommy milkers? Or whatever. Merci. The yandere that can never

52
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,080
love right? I mean, she's got plenty of love to give. Doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna be

53
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,960
alive at the end of it, okay? But hey ho, you know, you still get love done at the end of the day.

54
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,880
Or was it Emmy, the most controversially created character of all time? But hey ho,

55
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,240
look, we're just gonna skip past that. You know, if you ignore the lore or everything else,

56
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,600
that's fang, it's fang, it's fang. Stop worrying, you guys are such blurry warts, honestly.

57
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,240
Or was it Madame Sheevee herself, a little brothel owner? Because, you know, gonna be honest,

58
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,080
didn't really get many requests for a hypnotic cuttlefish, that's Scottish. But hey ho, hey ho,

59
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,720
that's how it goes, that's how it goes, that's how it goes, that's how it goes, that's how it goes.

60
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,480
There's what made me, let's, let me, let me formally and reduce massing. What do I need?

61
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:10,960
Look at these slays, they're so pretty, they're so pretty, okay? I, ladies and gentlemen, I'm

62
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,280
Strony Cuttles. Please, Cuttles, the surname is because I'm a Cuttlefish. Oh, shocker,

63
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:27,440
and Strony because I am Strony, the daughter of the gamer Strontyum. My dad's gamer tag is Stronyum.

64
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,760
No, it's not actually Stronyum before you're like, oh my god, you just dox your dad, no, relax,

65
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,880
it's not actually literally really, you know, Stronyum, but I'm, I'm Strony, Cuttles, I'm named

66
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,360
after my dad, my dad's gamer, and I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from

67
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,440
his ballsack. Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen, oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber

68
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,480
challenge of tell us your age. It's not really looking good, okay, it's not looking good.

69
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:02,400
Cuttlefish normally live two years, so time's ticking, time is ticking. Anyway, my birthday is

70
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,360
October 10th, which is actually National Squid and Cuttlefish Day, they're both set for the pod,

71
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,160
so I don't mind sharing that birthday with the Squid VTubers if there's any of these out there.

72
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:22,000
My height is 162 centimetres, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update this slide,

73
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,400
like a dafty, but hey, over here now. For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland,

74
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,720
the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language, so in your face,

75
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:44,880
I can speak two languages, so it's fantastic with that. And Grace, I am a Cuttlefish,

76
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,000
and I'm also good at the 100m sprint, thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week.

77
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:58,000
My legs and disc legs, I like mesmerising you, that part comes later, okay, very soon,

78
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,240
the debut is only 30 minutes long, you can go away long with us, okay, you know, really boom, boom,

79
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,760
really quick over here. ASMR, if you like ASMR, you're gonna get spoiled, rotten on my channel,

80
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,640
or any of the ViaLoreGirls' channels, show us your plasters, no, oh god, can you see it,

81
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,320
wait, you're not supposed to see that part, yeah, like, I have to censor myself, my design's a little

82
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,920
sussable, okay, okay, anyway, what was I saying, ASMR, if you like ASMR, me and my gen mates are

83
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,080
all literally ASMR'd out the wazoo, so don't be shy to like or subscribe on any of them,

84
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,120
can't help give you a bigger hint than that, but hey ho, I like seeing victory on my screen,

85
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,800
because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin possible, and you know, you get it from playing

86
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,920
multiplayer games, and you're in the same boat as me, and I also like plasters and band-aids,

87
00:15:50,880 --> 00:16:00,320
my wonder one, for no nefarious reason, for my dislikes, grrr, you know, hate is a strong word

88
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,520
for my dislikes instead, grrr, I don't like bullies in video games, your teammates aren't

89
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,800
often a magically beat MLG pro, so relax, you don't have fun, it's a multiplayer game, team game,

90
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,040
just enjoy yourselves, okay, I don't like serious people, I don't like seriousness, I think my gen

91
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:28,800
mates can all pretty much vouch that I am the most unserious and ridiculous, I can't be serious,

92
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,480
it's terrible, I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire

93
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,360
life, but hey ho, that's like, and I don't like Mongolian throat singing, I'm so sorry,

94
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:49,200
people seem to really like it, but I don't, it doesn't sound nice, so I apologize to the one

95
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Mongolian throat singer that's watching right now, but I just can't, okay, I'm nice and generic, sorry

96
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,440
there's nothing interesting about my tastes, movies, lord of the rings, best as we come,

97
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,440
animes, nice and generic again, books, I actually started reading books this year, I know that

98
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,440
sounds crazy as a sin because people like read books in general, me however, I started this year,

99
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,520
I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads,

100
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,200
for some reason they just really capture me, I like being depressed after reading a book,

101
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,640
for my music Hatsune Miku and Atarashi Gaku, I want to see them live if it's possible, but

102
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:42,720
yeah, sorry it's like choking my spit, oh yeah, just a wee bit of a gamer, a tiny bit of a gamer,

103
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,200
like it doesn't mean I'm good at games, now before there's that one person that's like,

104
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,680
you've played all these games, that means you're MLG pro, not relax, relax, I've played games full

105
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,360
stop, okay, these are the games that I remember playing or just kind of like have a good, yeah

106
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,800
played them type thing, okay, so you might have a few things in common, I could, you know,

107
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,760
move out of the way, there's like some Lego games, I still love my Lego games, but yeah,

108
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,520
these are all the games that I remember playing, there's tons that I've obviously missed out on

109
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,600
that are like so tiny that it's kind of hard to mention, but there's a big ol' square red for you,

110
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,080
as we see it was about an Xbox gamer, do apologize, the old Call of Duty days,

111
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,800
yeah, for my goals, um, I want to get monetized on YouTube,

112
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,600
so feel free to subscribe, because we have been called like crazy since then,

113
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,600
and we need watch hours, so don't be shy to rewatch anything that is offered on the channel,

114
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,280
I want to stream so much that you can basically read everything in my voice, and you know,

115
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,480
you'll be Scots yourself, and you can apply for citizenship, and all that good stuff,

116
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,760
I also want to create a mega ASMR collab with my gen mates, which I've already got quite a few

117
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,480
on the way, so don't worry, it's coming, you just gotta wait, okay, um, I have a childhood dream,

118
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,240
actually, of a 100,000 gamer score, and it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass,

119
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:24,000
I would absolutely love to explore a taken amount of, um, childhood games, and I would love to play

120
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,560
like your childhood games as well, because obviously I was kind of at the mercy of what

121
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,680
my dad would buy me for childhood games, so it doesn't quite count, um, so here's a little fun

122
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:43,600
factoid about me, I'm a wee bit of a workaholic, so I would like to say that for every 1000 subscribers

123
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,120
I get on my YouTube channel, I'm going to upload a celebratory, really hard to say that if you're

124
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,760
Scottish, celebratory ASMR video, pair 1000 subscribers, I've already got like tons

125
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:05,920
ready to go, so don't be shy, you know what to do, wink, wink, I also want to challenge myself,

126
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,520
I want to collab, I want to make ASMR collabs with over 100 different VTubers, and I'm actually

127
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,640
so much of a workaholic, I already have three confirmed with VTubers outside of VLR, so

128
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,480
I'm very serious about that, if you ever have a 3DO, you're a VTuber, I'm coming to find you in

129
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,200
your DMs, um, I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together, I think it would be so fun,

130
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,400
I'm not a very strong reader, but I think it would be really cute to do like a little, um,

131
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,760
like before the end of stream, we read one chapter or something like that, and last but certainly

132
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,600
not least, I would love to get stream sniped, I absolutely adore it, I love playing multiplayer

133
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,560
games where you can join me and you can have an amazing time and have so much fun, it's just one

134
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,680
of my favourite things okay, so please do not be shy, every week I plan on playing multiplayer

135
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,520
games where you can join me at any point, I will try to make them free and accessible as I can,

136
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
these are my goals, thank you, thank you, thank you,

137
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm dumb, okay, I'm really dumb, I don't know how to come up with tags, I'm not funny, I'm not good

138
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:23,200
with puns, so I am more than happy to take any suggestion, um, we can figure it out very soon,

139
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,960
don't worry, okay, my Oshi marks are squid, but I'm a cuttlefish, but squids and cuttlefish are

140
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,040
cephalopod, so I don't mind sharing the emoji, and then the second emoji kind of looks like a man

141
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,760
bowing, hmm, hmm, maybe that is a hint to what I might try to make content wise,

142
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,120
and for fan names, there is only gonna be one option, come on, let's not beat around the bush,

143
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:01,040
you are my refling, you will always be my refling, and thank you so fucking much for waiting, I have

144
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:11,040
bloody missed you, special shout out to Nari, and Squishy Goal, you may have noticed a bit of a

145
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:18,640
trending pattern, alright, a bit of a trending pattern, uh, Squishy Goal, conceptualized as all,

146
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,520
and Nari helped out and made us come to life, which is beautiful, beautiful, and also as a little

147
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,600
mini announcement, the Vealor website, the official Vealor website will be updated shortly, and everyone

148
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,760
who created the gen one at any, any stage is gonna be credited on the website, so you'll see these

149
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,160
names very soon on that website once the update comes out, so thank you everyone who came together

150
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:52,880
to meet this fantastic gen of indulge, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, no, no, most people get to do, oh,

151
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:01,040
this is my gen mate's impression, okay, gen mate's impression, me, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

152
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:08,720
I picked my gen mates, do you understand, I picked them, okay, now I'm gonna tell you why I picked them,

153
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:15,600
you ready for this? Mercy's determination, she was gonna make it no matter what,

154
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,000
a little determining, like, the definition of mercy in the dictionary, if you look up,

155
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,880
it just says determined, okay, there is no way in heck she was not gonna get in, that's all I'm

156
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:39,440
gonna say on that one, and then Emi, I'm gonna have to be, Emi said to someone who was being

157
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,400
rude to her to keep themselves safe in Minecraft, and then she instantly got the part, okay,

158
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,640
I say, I say, oh, I say, has fantastic experience in history, and she's such a hard worker, she,

159
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,960
she gives her best, okay, she gives everything 100%, and it was absolutely beautiful, and she

160
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,720
actually, she had the most, um, she had the most professional application, even though English

161
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,800
is in her first language, and I'm like, god damn, I see, you're fucking impressive,

162
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,200
um, then Azura, okay, I describe Azura as my little diamond in the rough, now hear me out

163
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,680
before you're like, isn't that an insult, relax, I'm not told the full story yet, my goodness,

164
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,760
you're jumping the gun, I was going to cross off Azura's stream as I was reviewing her,

165
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,080
because she wasn't talking, she wasn't interacting, she wasn't really doing anything,

166
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:48,640
and then she said three words in that voice, oh, Azura, she instantly became Azura, she said

167
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,840
three words, and she got the damn part, and she was like, in that voice, in that, I can't mimic

168
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:04,800
her voice, okay, but I need gold, oh, Rosyksu, Rosyksu, and Shivi, Shivi is everything I should

169
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:11,280
have been in another life, okay, she is going very far, I'm very happy, absolutely, I could not have

170
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,840
asked for better gen mates, I am blown away that these girls even have freaking applied to such a

171
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,240
crazy idea, and here we are, debut, and you guys have shown nothing but love and support,

172
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,160
and we are all so thankful, I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like, holy fuck, thank you,

173
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,880
because we didn't expect any of this, we're just like, yeah, we're just going to be my butt,

174
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:44,880
Ray, let me take you to, is that it, oh, I forgot to put away, it's for decoration,

175
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,320
okay, the tentacle in the back is for decoration, no questions, okay, no questions, let me do the

176
00:25:52,320 --> 00:26:01,440
full body, let's start with the full body, may have a bandaid on for reasons, but as you can see,

177
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,920
I got some swivelly hips, thank you, no hurry, you know, we'll start from the bottom,

178
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,560
start from the bottom, never hear, you know how it is, okay, so if you didn't know, I actually

179
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:19,920
have what's known as a French manicure and pedicure, so you can see my little toenails,

180
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:27,120
this is French manicure, pedicure, and then you go up my face, and don't even be careful at my

181
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,120
thighs, because with a bandaid, is this smart, is this white, okay, okay, I don't think that's white,

182
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:41,920
okay, check it out, see look, I've got, oh my voice, I've got a French pedicure, manicure, see,

183
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,760
okay, we're just gonna skip past the bottom part, okay, and as you can see, if you look really close

184
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:55,200
to the elbows, I have pearlescent to my outfit, my outfit isn't white, it's pearlescent, so I shimmer

185
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,480
as I move about, it's fantastic, and so does my seashells, that's the top two, if you look at

186
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:08,480
real close, you have to really look for it, but look, I'm a shiny little seashell, what do you think,

187
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,920
it's good though, yeah, I'm in the Yukata, because it's a homage to Japanese culture,

188
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,960
because without Japanese culture, let's be honest, maybe, maybe trippers would be here, so

189
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,080
you know, the little Yukata going on, okay, let me, let me get real close, hopefully this isn't

190
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,360
uncomfortable, I know some people aren't like the best with eye contact, but look, don't, it's me,

191
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:45,040
it's me, okay, I'm a freak, I'm a star, I'm a star, and like, if I open my eyes, it opens,

192
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,960
I love you so much, oh and I'm sad, I'm sad, please, better not upset me, go subscribe to my

193
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,120
you upset me, I put pupil restructuring, what did you say,

194
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,640
I'm unamused, you failed me, I don't know, I can't do it, I can't do it the way she

195
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,280
does it, she's just off the top of her head, I'm like, these are my heart eyes, I love them,

196
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,520
and like, okay, this is just my opinion, but do you see how my neck is doing that thing,

197
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,560
where like, in the chin area, and it disappears, I love it so much in each of her models when

198
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:36,640
they do it, it's just, I love it, I love it, I love it, you're trying to make me blush,

199
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:46,560
you ever seen a blushing cut before? Oh, actually this is a very good point, some people don't like

200
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,400
backseat gaming, oh, I'm the opposite, I'm very dumb, I'm very happy for you a backseat game,

201
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,080
so you're probably going to see this one a lot if you care to watch me at any point,

202
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,600
and I got, oh I was kind of, look at that stuff there, how deep that went though, I was like,

203
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,960
swear, you know, looking at my gen mates all day, like, come on, the designs are good, don't lie,

204
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:19,200
oh, I might have just kind of spoiled it there, but you know how to cut fish,

205
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,080
have hypnotic patterns, may I please do this for you, are you ready?

206
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,080
Yes, we're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR, I love it,

207
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,440
you wouldn't fall for my hypnotic capabilities,

208
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,840
but if you're really struggling, like, if you're really struggling, how about this?

209
00:29:50,160 --> 00:30:07,440
Yeah, it's over for you, just admit it, it's over for you, I mean, how can you resist,

210
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:15,600
why can't you resist this little Scottish accent? Right, right, right, attend, schedule time,

211
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:25,760
so my gen mates are all doing debut 2.0s, which is fantastic, me on the other hand,

212
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:33,920
I'm exposing the damn company, I've had enough of VLR, I'm exposing every little dirty secret they

213
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:40,240
have, so if you're excited to know the ins and outs of what it's like to run a VTuber agency,

214
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,280
to create one, to fund one, to know what goes on behind the scenes, that's right,

215
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:54,080
you can show up to my stream, the motor, obviously, I'm playing the greatest game of all time in

216
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:02,000
my first week, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, I will not be taking any statements, any questions,

217
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,040
and any threats about claiming that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is not the greatest game of all

218
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:14,240
time, so sorry, not sorry, but yeah, we also have needy streamer overload, James Cameron's Avatar,

219
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,400
which is such a niche game, I think about two people who are watching this right now, probably

220
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,440
played it, the multiplayer game of the week is Old School Runescape, if you'd like to do some

221
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:31,680
questing with me, I'm also doing an ASMR stream, and a handcam stream, where I'm trying foreign

222
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:40,000
sweets, or candy, if you're American, or if you're Australian you say lollipops,

223
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,080
so yeah, I did a little cheeky handcam stream, I think there's a few handcam streams coming up

224
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,240
from my gen mates already, someone was surprised I was doing handcam and I'm like,

225
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,800
I mean, we're not like, I don't know what part kind of tips you off that we're not like other

226
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,560
agencies, unironically, like was it the 80-20 split maybe, did that tip you off, or like the 100%

227
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,600
marriage sales got the talent, was it that part that tips you off that we're not quite like any other

228
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:20,880
agency, but yeah, let's go to Chihuahua, that's a lot of movement, it's a lot of movement,

229
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,120
but yes, that is my first week, I'm pretty much an endurance streamer, so good luck keeping up with

230
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:38,800
me, okay, Emmy Dookie, Emmy, right, thank you all so much, we are all going to collectively have

231
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,960
a 30-minute rest, and then guess what, you get to see us all interact together live, okay, we're

232
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,600
going to be telling some funny stories, some rather embarrassing stories, but hey ho, it's good content,

233
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,480
it's good content, that's right, and I will thank you all so much for all the love that

234
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,960
we've shown myself or my gen mates at will, and we will see you in 30 minutes, you will

235
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,120
automatically be redirected into the lovely group room, and we will see you in 30 minutes, okay,

236
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,800
can you wait 30 minutes, 30 more minutes, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, I'll see you then, okay,

237
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,640
thank you so much, bye!
