0	20000	my little reflex I added a denoiser filter but I don't know if that made this stream worse
21000	23000	hi reflex
29000	43000	mommy's right here she just had to wake up late because I was I was being a mommy and I was having to do a lot of work
43000	49000	strong is life to buy some any need
50000	54000	hello hello my little reflex
56000	60000	sh sh sh sh it's okay
61000	63000	mommy's here
64000	69000	sh sh sh hello little baby
69000	87000	I've put a little, um, a noise gate on the microphone, so hopefully the background noise isn't like the weight noise isn't too bad.
87000	95000	I, um, they don't cope well without you know, I don't cope well without my reflex.
95000	110000	I had to do some business last night, and there may or may not be a collab with another agency planned.
110000	122000	Um, do I spoil it? Do you want me to spoil the surprise? Because only, you only know what the surprise is if you're in this chat right now.
122000	128000	Also, please do check emotes for those of you who are on the emotes here.
128000	138000	I was able to add all 10 of my emotes, and I get to order 10 more, and I'm so excited to order the next batch of 10 emotes.
138000	146000	Um, I already have a few ideas, but yes, please.
146000	158000	I will try to be as relaxed as I can, but the problem is, I get so excited talking to you.
158000	165000	That basically, the ASMR goes out the window all the time, which is, there we go.
165000	167000	Yeah, there's your warning.
167000	173000	Uh, we are not doing hypnosis, uh, unfortunately.
173000	179000	Thank you very much, Nate Sterling, for becoming a free-fling member, dear.
179000	184000	Real dear. God, I need to change the name of that. It's like, so big.
184000	195000	Long-toe-mo-win. Ah, you leave my long-toes out of them, disclaimer's single.
195000	202000	But I'm going to try and be relaxing. Thank you, Jay, for becoming a member.
202000	207000	Thank you, Ken, Gwispy, for becoming a member.
207000	211000	I know I've got my hypnosis background.
211000	218000	I was originally going, ah, Brian.
218000	223000	Can you guys hear Brian?
223000	229000	Ah, Pachinka, thank you for the 5 gifted, hold on, let me get a stream of elements, oh.
229000	234000	Anonymous, thank you for the tip.
234000	240000	Wait. Anonymous is ice-tronning, hopefully your day is amazing.
240000	246000	It's just gone started, and since I can't just start with my reef links, it's going great.
246000	250000	Brian is very quiet, yes.
250000	256000	I didn't, I knew ASMR, so I turned Brian down, like, right away.
256000	260000	I can maybe foam up a little bit, but...
260000	263000	I have a quick question, how did you learn hypnosis?
263000	268000	I just observe. I want to get into it, but it's kind of intimidating.
268000	276000	Literally, I just observe. I absolutely love going, like, deep into things I don't know about,
276000	285000	and I've always had an interest in it, so I like to consume people's production, or whatever.
286000	290000	Zarian, ah, thank you for the 100.
290000	294000	Congrats on monetization years for some of that most, bro.
294000	298000	Zarian, that's a lot. Thank you.
298000	300000	Oh my god.
300000	303000	100 dollar tip, that's crazy.
303000	306000	100 centimeters, nah, that's not possible.
306000	311000	But Pachinka, thank you for the 5 gifted.
312000	318000	But yeah, I just really like challenging myself.
318000	325000	I always have a fascination in trying to understand why people like certain things.
325000	331000	I know that seems silly, but I do.
331000	338000	I just enjoy it, like, as much as I might tease the prep bros or something like that.
338000	341000	I just find it fascinating, I honestly do.
341000	352000	Like, what makes you, you know, what tickles your pickle is a challenge to me, and I accept it wholeheartedly.
355000	364000	But yeah, Secret Subject is an excellent feature, but Secret Subject is such a sweet heart.
364000	374000	She so willingly educates the masses about it, and like, I love that she doesn't like cakey bit or anything.
374000	384000	But like, everything that I do right now, or produce, is because of observations I've made.
384000	387000	Mangope, thank you.
387000	391000	She's learning from spells and empathizing.
391000	393000	It reminds me of someone.
394000	398000	Yeah, Secret is fantastic.
398000	406000	She's got a new feature, Bermuda, which is like a polygon design, like the older video games.
406000	414000	And I was tempted to get one for myself when I'm playing Nintendo DS games, because the graphics,
414000	419000	we're going to be playing a game called Dragon Quest Senators of the Stars, guys.
420000	429000	And obviously the graphics are Nintendo graphics, but I thought it would be cool if that model would match,
429000	433000	but I'd rather save the money and get it for the girls.
433000	439000	Like, I have very bad news for Shibi and Insura investors.
439000	444000	They will be getting a toggle that covers them up.
444000	450000	Me and Mercy did not upset...
450000	454000	Congrats to those who got the memberships with their face.
454000	462000	Me and Mercy's chests don't upset YouTube.
462000	466000	Insura and Shibi's chests has upset YouTube.
466000	478000	If you notice that A.C.'s trailer video has 30,000 views, that's because advertisement money was put into it.
478000	483000	Everyone had the same amount of advertisement money, except me.
483000	486000	I've never put the same amount on myself.
486000	489000	I actually don't think I've spent any on myself.
490000	501000	But Insura and Shibi were denied at running predominantly due to their chests.
501000	508000	Insura's ASMR short was denied, even though she's not doing a single thing wrong in it.
508000	517000	So sadly, at the moment, the girls are being very creative and doing a little thing.
517000	528000	Yes, I will say to the girls, they are welcome to use their toggles when they think the situation calls for it.
528000	530000	That's perfectly fine by me.
530000	536000	Yes, even the shorts, the girls weren't allowed.
537000	549000	Now that they're monetized, today, Mercy is doing her celebration, I believe.
549000	557000	So please do let her entertain you.
557000	560000	I'm probably going to be lurking her monetization.
560000	562000	Our thing is live.
562000	565000	AC is on Saturday.
565000	569000	Emmy, I don't know when Emmy wants to do it.
569000	574000	I mean, you know what? I'm going to DM her right now.
575000	599000	A-M-E-A-M-R-S just wanted to know when you plan, when you plan on doing your S-L-A-B-R-E-S-E on stream.
599000	611000	Just so I know when to remember S-L-A-B-R-S-E live.
611000	619000	And then I'll do a little, and before she's in the channel, and then I'll do a little head-butt.
620000	622000	Need a Mercedes.
622000	627000	She's so going to know how to type that live, there's no way.
627000	632000	Oh no, she's on mobile. She's on her phone, she can see.
632000	637000	Oh my god, the key clicking was in my head when my headphones, sorry.
637000	641000	Emmy was watching AC, okay.
641000	653000	Yes, Azura and Shibi, it is not lost on me that Azura and Shibi are waiting for monetization, and they both just happened to have the biggest boobs.
654000	658000	Feature for manager ASMR.
658000	672000	It's, I do like the boring stuff, like the kind of monotonous stuff where it's like, oh you need to open up membership to your type thing, and you need to do this and that.
672000	686000	Like, I try not to let the girls do that, because it's both stressful and it's both like, it takes time, and rather the girls focus on having fun at debut and all.
686000	690000	And then they're, well they're second week now.
690000	698000	Not bad, I wasn't expecting it to sound so real. That's cause they're for ya.
698000	702000	But they will get monetization nonetheless, right?
702000	706000	Well, we're waiting on it.
706000	712000	I think the AI detection is flagged to them, basically.
712000	717000	So a human does need to review them, which takes longer.
718000	729000	Let's just pray that we have like a weep that understands what an earth featuring is, cause if they get denied, I'm gonna be so...
729000	732000	I'm gonna be raging, I'm not even gonna lie.
732000	740000	I don't think there's gonna be issues, I think the AI has just sent them on to...
741000	745000	And... yeah.
745000	751000	Someone says you own your own tag at Realtary For now, let's go!
751000	756000	Weeps and YouTube headquarters, yeah.
756000	758000	They better...
758000	764000	Did you like my ASMR yesterday? Oh my god, I was outrageous.
764000	768000	I can't believe I even did that.
770000	775000	I got my tools out, I bet you liked that, didn't ya?
775000	778000	I was juicy.
785000	789000	I was pretty gay, great, but can you feel your teeth?
789000	792000	What, cause I liked it so much.
792000	799000	One of your friends had a Q&A, I wanted to send a message, but I was too scared to send one.
799000	801000	Hi Anna.
801000	807000	Do they not see who sent them or do they see if you send a message in front of them?
807000	810000	Thank you for the tip, Anna.
810000	814000	I don't know if you heard that, cause Brian is so nice and quiet.
814000	820000	Are marshmallow messages anonymous? Yes, that is why they are favoured by many.
820000	827000	One of my gen mates had a Q&A and you wanted to ask a question, but you were scared to send one.
827000	833000	Do they see you send some or you know we do not see a single thing?
833000	838000	Information-wise, it's just a question.
838000	846000	You can send them if you want, but... yeah.
846000	851000	Do they not see you send them or do they see if you send the message in the past? No.
851000	855000	I can vouch right now and say no, I cannot tell.
855000	860000	Someone could send me three questions in a row and change their spelling.
860000	864000	And I wouldn't know, so I'm looking confident here.
864000	868000	Hi Brian in the far distance.
868000	875000	I left work early to watch you, but guys, I hope you're okay and you feel better soon.
875000	883000	I like the measuring section. Now everyone knows I have long toes, what you can do about it.
883000	888000	But yes, please, so can you tell, based on spelling.
888000	891000	Well, you don't have to worry about me when it comes to spelling.
891000	899000	There's absolutely no way I can clock you other than if you send a...
899000	902000	I recognise that girl.
902000	904000	Sitting on your feet again.
904000	910000	I'm Gollum sitting right now, so my feet are in front of me and pushed into the chair.
910000	916000	She's learning the pattern. No, I cannot do that.
916000	926000	I do, I'll let the girl talk about it, but there's one girl, a vealer, that does recognise text.
926000	933000	Monka Ace, I don't know how her brain does it, but yeah.
933000	937000	We were close to having a cats and ace workshop.
937000	939000	You've got to see Kim Lee.
939000	944000	And then I go, that's where we learned Kim Lee.
944000	946000	How's your daughter?
946000	951000	Yeah, I'm going to get a doctor's appointment, something's not right.
951000	955000	Someone was like, you need to sue, and I was like, nah, it's just what happens.
955000	960000	It's kind of a risk you accept, because it's a job shop.
960000	968000	You can get like, sorry, I need to scratch my head, my head says sin, or my headset and then...
968000	971000	It's just the thing.
971000	974000	Watching you during my collab lecture.
974000	976000	I'm in your ears.
976000	980000	Look left, look right, I might be in the lecture audience right now.
980000	984000	I know that's not how it works, but get educated, get educated.
984000	985000	Please do go to the doctor.
985000	987000	Yeah, don't worry, I am.
987000	997000	Someone sent me a marshmallow, and I was like, okay, you've convinced me, so don't worry, I've got a doctor's appointment coming up.
997000	1000000	Someone says, very nice celebration.
1000000	1006000	Sorry, I'm reading marshmallows.
1007000	1010000	I'm so, so sleepy, wifling.
1010000	1014000	I was up solely, I've only had five hours sleep.
1014000	1018000	I'm probably going to go back to sleep, but yeah.
1018000	1025000	I was planning all these fun things, and making a lot of progress.
1027000	1031000	My ASMR series is about to start up.
1031000	1039000	My thank you for eggs subscriber series is about to start, and I have no idea what to edit first.
1039000	1045000	My first thing was going to be ear licking, but that's not allowed anymore.
1045000	1050000	And I did a pop rock ear licking, and that's not going to be allowed.
1050000	1054000	So, I have no idea.
1054000	1058000	I do have burping ASMR, I may make that.
1058000	1065000	I have like thigh cupping, I have like sitting on the mic ASMR, like I sit on it over and over again.
1065000	1070000	You're almost at 5K up here or not, you guys are showing too much support.
1070000	1075000	Thank you Lord of Stars for becoming a member.
1077000	1083000	But yeah, I do have like sitting on the mic ASMR, I was squatting so hard.
1083000	1089000	I have like clapping without using my hands ASMR, so that's going to be interesting.
1091000	1096000	But I'll probably edit all that stuff, you heard her hit 5K right now.
1096000	1100000	Stop being so amazing and perfect then.
1102000	1110000	Too much support, literally, but like, don't be, get subscribed, get subscribed, get subscribed.
1110000	1117000	So many ASMRs, yes, I have a long day to think of it.
1117000	1121000	Clapping without using your hands, oh yeah.
1121000	1123000	But Jane, thank you for the day.
1123000	1128000	No matter what you do for ASMR, I will enjoy you, even the burp ASMR.
1128000	1137000	I took a bottle of water, a bottle of water, and a can of cola in the ASMR booth.
1138000	1143000	I'm basically chocked in to produce burps for burping ear to ear ASMR.
1143000	1146000	I think it will be like 14 minutes long.
1146000	1152000	I need to order the artwork of me being pregnant with you because I want to make that ASMR.
1152000	1159000	I want to make it really good, I want to put all my love into it, especially the burp ASMR.
1160000	1163000	Suffering from success.
1163000	1168000	It's funny how you're giving the people what they need and what they want, yeah.
1168000	1175000	I made a joke and it was like the average featureber would do it behind all paywall me.
1175000	1179000	I come out swinging doing it week one, what are you going to do about it?
1179000	1180000	Huh?
1180000	1182000	What are you going to do about it?
1182000	1185000	That baby, literally me, the father, literally me.
1186000	1187000	Hello?
1187000	1188000	The what?
1188000	1189000	That's right.
1189000	1194000	I'm making an ASMR where I'm pregnant with you and you're the father.
1194000	1197000	And there's nothing you can do about it.
1197000	1200000	You had my curio saved but now you have my ditch.
1200000	1202000	You can't stop the cut-offs.
1205000	1207000	No you can't.
1207000	1210000	Oh forget, I have my supposed to read that name.
1211000	1214000	I have my supposed to say your name.
1214000	1217000	Wait, thank you for becoming a member.
1217000	1220000	Let's go on Google Translate real quick.
1220000	1224000	Google Translate.
1224000	1227000	Let's go.
1228000	1231000	What's the translation?
1231000	1236000	Apparently the translation is vacuum.
1236000	1240000	Thank you vacuum for becoming a member.
1240000	1242000	Maybe Joby Stroni ASMR.
1242000	1244000	Oh yeah, no 100%.
1244000	1250000	I'm going to do like a girlfriend forgets to mute her mic while she's eating.
1250000	1256000	So obviously it's only for people who like eating sounds because I inhale my food.
1256000	1263000	So I'm going to order like KFC and then basically just head recording.
1270000	1271000	There we go.
1271000	1272000	God bless this woman.
1272000	1274000	Also the baby and the father.
1274000	1275000	Literally me.
1275000	1280000	Average VTuber asking for 10 bucks to save me.
1280000	1285000	I mean, Milt Stroni put them grippers on the table from the start.
1285000	1288000	Hey, I will even value for money, okay?
1291000	1293000	Little Slurping ASMR.
1293000	1294000	Yeah.
1294000	1296000	Someone says Kuhaku.
1296000	1299000	Kuhaku Google Translate means real cool.
1299000	1302000	Kuhaku, thank you for the membership.
1302000	1306000	Hold on, I can't even see if I'm picking the audio or not.
1307000	1310000	I watched some VTuber data here.
1313000	1316000	Well, ASMR is helping me to sleep.
1316000	1317000	I'm glad.
1317000	1321000	We're having a very relaxed ASMR.
1321000	1322000	A.C.
1322000	1327000	My gen mate, you can click the link in the description.
1327000	1331000	She has been killing it with ASMR recently.
1331000	1333000	She's been doing so good.
1333000	1340000	So if you like live ASMR, that's extra cuddly and a little bit sus.
1340000	1345000	Please do check your A.C. Snowballs in the description below.
1345000	1348000	My little reef links.
1348000	1353000	Thank you all so much for the support you've been showing the girls.
1353000	1356000	It just is so much.
1356000	1360000	It means so much that you even give them a chance.
1360000	1365000	Everyone has their favorite little feeler girl.
1365000	1369000	Or some of you can't even decide, which is so adorable.
1371000	1372000	It's just been...
1372000	1373000	Wait, did I say thank you, bitch?
1373000	1375000	I can't go for the super chat.
1375000	1376000	Thank you.
1376000	1378000	I'm so sorry if I didn't.
1378000	1383000	I got stream elements open so I can see anything I miss.
1383000	1386000	But yeah, thank you.
1386000	1389000	He did admit it, I can't say.
1389000	1393000	Spicy hot slurping ASMR.
1393000	1399000	So I follow in real life ASMRists.
1399000	1405000	And they also got it with a warning for ear licking.
1405000	1411000	So yeah, my theory that YouTube has done a stales policy update
1411000	1414000	is getting stronger and stronger by the second.
1414000	1418000	In real life channels are now getting hit as well.
1418000	1422000	So, oh, I just cracked my freaking wrist if you heard that.
1422000	1424000	That was so loud.
1424000	1429000	Hello, thank you for joining me.
1429000	1433000	Shh, shh, shh, shh.
1433000	1439000	Hypnotize the drill ASMR or I'd like to make that a little bit cute.
1439000	1441000	I came for you but they all seem great.
1441000	1446000	They are so fantastic and they're each in an individual way.
1446000	1452000	Like, I'm so glad that one girl can like speak to you.
1452000	1459000	Let's get the tinfoil hats since you're true candy when you're licking.
1459000	1466000	Yeah, I think I'll just get them out by Twitter premium.
1466000	1474000	So I get Brian, ReluctantlySaint, thank you for the tip.
1474000	1479000	ReluctantlySaint says the towers are so wonderfully amazing.
1479000	1481000	It's hard not to love them all.
1481000	1483000	It's literally impossible.
1483000	1489000	But yes, I think I will buy Twitter premium.
1489000	1493000	And I'll just upload those ear licking videos that I recorded.
1493000	1501000	And I'll also put them on Patreon just like for storage so you can listen at any time, okay?
1501000	1507000	Because it seems a shame to like waste those recorded sessions.
1507000	1512000	For Twitter premium, let's make upload like full videos.
1512000	1517000	So I'll just put it on like for free and all that.
1517000	1519000	Give it a lot of money.
1519000	1523000	Look, I don't have a chance I got to defeat you for a shuffle, okay?
1523000	1528000	You just crack it down and ruin it forever. You're ruining it.
1528000	1533000	Do you guys want me to put you in between my thighs?
1533000	1538000	That's your in between my thighs right now.
1538000	1545000	Okay, do you like it? Do you want to be in between my thighs forever?
1545000	1548000	Oh, sorry, I'm picking the mic.
1548000	1554000	Okay, you just stay in between my thighs.
1554000	1558000	That 3G, oh, literally, I got you in a headlock.
1558000	1561000	There's nothing we can do about it.
1561000	1566000	We're a watermelon, honestly.
1566000	1567000	Bansley.
1567000	1575000	Yes, we can link Bansley on YouTube, that's not allowed.
1575000	1577000	Please crush my school.
1577000	1581000	I feel like all the platforms are going over the top filtering.
1581000	1586000	Yes, I agree, it's getting ridiculous.
1586000	1588000	My enjoyers are being fed.
1588000	1591000	Could you imagine?
1591000	1595000	How good you are at ASMR sounds from my cardboard?
1595000	1600000	Don't be a stop-at, don't be a troll, box enthusiast.
1600000	1603000	Thank you for the neat tip.
1603000	1605000	Don't be so silly.
1605000	1612000	You're just trying to upset me, Mr. Cardboard Box, aren't you?
1612000	1623000	Well, the funny thing is, Twitter just announced that they officially acknowledged and accept that kind of content.
1623000	1631000	And I was like, wait a minute, but this is good for us, this is based.
1631000	1637000	But yes, you can't stop the reeflings, I can know.
1637000	1641000	Watermelons in your neighborhood, now you're reeflings.
1641000	1644000	You'll always be my reeflings.
1644000	1649000	I had to wait an entire year to call you reeflings, okay?
1649000	1654000	I'm actually going to make, I think I may have said this, I can't remember if I have or not.
1654000	1664000	I am going to make a reprogramming hypnosis ASMR where I get you to forget your name and make you respond to reefling.
1664000	1668000	And it's going to be a subconscious plant.
1668000	1673000	So it will always be effective unless, sorry, that was my hot water bottle if you heard it.
1673000	1682000	Unless you listen to my audio that reverses any permanent effects, it's going to be my permanent effect.
1682000	1691000	First audio is you are reefling, you will respond to reefling, and you are mine and owned by me.
1691000	1701000	But I am a merciful streamer and you're more than welcome to be part of other communities,
1701000	1706000	such as Snippets and HeroM and all that, I don't have a problem.
1706000	1713000	The reprogramming, yes, I do have a reprogramming audio, it will be available very shortly.
1713000	1720000	The funny thing is, I'm going to upload it before I even upload any permanent effect hypnosis.
1720000	1727000	Just to be super super safe and everyone knows where to crop it.
1727000	1736000	Don't need hypnosis for that, I already forgot my name, I don't need, I can reprogram, can reprogram, can reprogram.
1736000	1742000	Yes, shh, shh, can reprogram.
1742000	1745500	Good to know we'll have it from the start.
1745500	1750500	I already responded to Riefling, did ya?
1750500	1754500	I think that's so adorable.
1754500	1758500	You're such a good Riefling, aren't ya?
1758500	1762500	So well-behaved for me.
1762500	1767500	I love that you're a good boy for me.
1767500	1772500	And I love that we can tease each other
1772500	1776500	and just have a really good day.
1776500	1778500	Yeah, I'm my kid mommy.
1778500	1780500	Oh, no, mommy. I said mommy.
1780500	1781500	I read mommy in the chat.
1781500	1785500	This is why I can't read into ASMR the same day.
1785500	1790500	Thank you, sir. Okay.
1790500	1792500	Thank you for the consideration.
1792500	1799500	Oh, yeah, no, I'm educated enough to know a permanent effect.
1799500	1803500	Hypnosis, I don't. I think it's very dangerous too.
1803500	1805500	Pachinga, thank you for the 10.
1805500	1811500	Super chat, we accept our stinky overlord.
1811500	1815500	It's not in my budget to support both on-paperture
1815500	1817500	and membership.
1817500	1819500	What do you recommend?
1819500	1823500	Please note, I always have free content always coming out as well
1823500	1825500	on my alternative to whatever I do have plans.
1825500	1826500	Please don't worry.
1826500	1831500	There'll always be free streams and free audios of that variety.
1831500	1835500	If you prefer a live stream experience,
1835500	1843500	then YouTube membership, if you prefer a audio,
1843500	1851500	edited audio experience, where the ending you are supposed to ink.
1851500	1854500	Definitely check out my Patreon.
1854500	1862500	The link is in the description.
1862500	1867500	Oh, I just went sniffing ASMR.
1867500	1871500	Oh, a replay.
1871500	1874500	Oh, I know, sniffing is limited ads.
1874500	1877500	Oh, I'm so sorry, sniffing is limited ads.
1877500	1880500	I completely forgot.
1880500	1890500	I don't know why, but sniffing ASMR is also considered like gratifying content.
1890500	1893500	So I can't really do sniffing.
1893500	1898500	Yeah, I don't know what is going on at YouTube headquarters,
1898500	1903500	but something funky and sus is going on.
1903500	1906500	I don't know of all things.
1906500	1909500	I know, I honestly, I don't understand.
1909500	1912500	There's a hidden policy update going on.
1912500	1914500	They've not announced it.
1914500	1916500	I think the reason they're not announced it
1916500	1920500	is because so many people enjoy ASMR.
1920500	1925500	Zenbros, yeah, I don't know why.
1925500	1930500	All of A.C.'s streams are limited ads.
1930500	1933500	I don't know what she's getting up to in her streams.
1933500	1937500	But it's definitely not looking good.
1937500	1940500	Now, YouTube have reverted policies before,
1940500	1944500	so I'm going to hope that they do.
1944500	1946500	AceDia.
1946500	1948500	Oh my God, I can't say that name.
1948500	1951500	There's too many vowels in your name.
1951500	1954500	AceDia.
1954500	1957500	Thank you for the membership.
1957500	1959500	That's not why you say that.
1959500	1961500	AceDia.
1961500	1963500	I am so sorry.
1963500	1966500	I'm absolutely picturing your name.
1967500	1970500	At the street, YouTube will be only ASMR.
1970500	1973500	Ace does not stay safe.
1973500	1975500	Oh, okay, well, alright.
1975500	1980500	I mean, I can't do a few things here and there.
1982500	1986500	As long as no one says a thing.
1989500	1990500	I'm a girl.
1990500	1992500	I know I'm not the main demographic by La Vie La.
1992500	1995500	Oh, I'm so glad you're going to enjoy it.
1996500	1999500	We are...
1999500	2004500	It's like, I'm not going to lie and say that, you know,
2004500	2008500	guys pay my bills, so I'll appeal to you guys.
2008500	2011500	But I'm glad you're going to enjoy the alert for what it's worth.
2011500	2013500	My lips are sealed.
2013500	2016500	If your lips are sealed, then maybe,
2016500	2019500	just maybe we can get up to a few shenanigans,
2019500	2022500	because reflex when we shenan once,
2022500	2025500	you know we're going to shenan again.
2030500	2033500	Ace's YouTube streams are very...
2033500	2037500	Okay, I'll take your word for it, Evelyn.
2039500	2042500	Yeah, snitches get stitches.
2042500	2044500	Don't think I won't send any on you.
2044500	2049500	Do you think that book is just for resurrection spells?
2049500	2052500	That book, oh dear.
2052500	2055500	That book is nothing but trouble.
2055500	2059500	The things that Emmy can do to you is staggering.
2060500	2063500	I'll say Emmy on you, okay?
2063500	2065500	Lips are completely sealed.
2065500	2067500	Good.
2069500	2071500	You're going to shenan again.
2071500	2073500	Yeah.
2074500	2077500	Wait, can you really hypnotize people?
2077500	2079500	Well, in my other ASMR stream,
2079500	2082500	I think I managed to get quite a few.
2082500	2085500	I'm not doing hypnosis right now, though,
2085500	2089500	but I do have some hypnosis audios coming out in the plan.
2091500	2095500	I wonder if Andy and Lili was an inspiration for Emmy's lore?
2095500	2096500	No.
2096500	2099500	I had not actually played or consumed the game
2099500	2102500	when Emmy was conceptualized.
2102500	2105500	She was conceptualized in June last year.
2106500	2109500	The reason why Emmy is Emmy is because
2109500	2112500	I'm a massive fucking pro con.
2113500	2116500	Yeah, all the girls may or may not have been
2116500	2119500	mainly influenced by what I like.
2122500	2125500	I came to say this, but Emmy is everything.
2125500	2129500	If I had a later voice, I am not even kidding.
2129500	2132500	If I had a later voice, Emmy is exactly who
2132500	2135500	I would want to be as a content creator.
2135500	2140500	The lore, the oni-chan,
2140500	2144500	but I don't have a late voice, so I can't be Emmy.
2144500	2148500	Ms. Morgan, thank you for becoming a member.
2148500	2151500	Your hypnosis eyes animation is so unique.
2151500	2153500	It's so good.
2153500	2155500	Like, wow.
2155500	2157500	Oh, I think I need to get a little closer.
2157500	2160500	Don't worry, I'm not hypnotizing you this stream.
2160500	2162500	What? Sorry.
2163500	2165500	Um, but yeah.
2165500	2168500	If you really want to, like...
2168500	2171500	I'm not hypnotizing you, don't worry.
2171500	2173500	But yeah, that's my...
2173500	2176500	And I can also stack them
2176500	2179500	if you wanted a bigger focal point to focus on.
2179500	2182500	So it's kind of like a hidden spiral.
2183500	2186500	Or, like this.
2186500	2189500	This is like very big, basic.
2190500	2192500	But yeah.
2192500	2194500	I will utilize these.
2194500	2196500	Wow, I'm like really close.
2196500	2198500	Is this too close?
2198500	2200500	Do I need to be further away?
2202500	2204500	Or do you like seeing my teeth?
2211500	2214500	Your eyes are so pretty. Thank you.
2214500	2218500	I love that all of us at VLR have unique pupils.
2219500	2220500	My...
2220500	2222500	It's a very nice distance.
2222500	2223500	Okay.
2223500	2225500	I'll stay here then.
2227500	2229500	My bangs are slightly transparent.
2229500	2231500	Yeah, do you like seeing my eyebrows?
2235500	2237500	Can you see my ears a little bit?
2237500	2238500	Yeah.
2239500	2241500	Get to some of my ear.
2241500	2243500	Wow.
2244500	2249500	I promise I won't do any hypnotizing permanent events.
2250500	2252500	I will.
2252500	2254500	An apple in a box.
2254500	2255500	Thank you for the tip.
2255500	2257500	I think everyone should start manually breathing.
2258500	2260500	What have you done?
2260500	2262500	What have you unleashed upon these lands?
2262500	2264500	Unleashed upon these lands?
2264500	2265500	I dare you.
2269500	2272500	Speaking of AC.
2272500	2274500	Hi, AC.
2274500	2278500	Who's my adorable little feral?
2278500	2280500	Merikisukaki.
2281500	2284500	What was AC doing in her stream?
2284500	2286500	I don't know.
2286500	2289500	I know you AC did back-to-back ASMR.
2289500	2291500	So do check out AC.
2291500	2293500	I also...
2293500	2295500	I'm going to spoil something because you're here.
2295500	2296500	AC, don't worry.
2296500	2299500	You don't have to talk because you'll be tired after stream.
2300500	2304500	There's going to be a collab ASMR channel on AC's channel.
2305500	2307500	Of all the viewer girls.
2308500	2310500	And it's freaking adorable.
2310500	2311500	And I love it.
2311500	2313500	And I can't wait.
2313500	2314500	I can't wait.
2314500	2315500	Post up quietly.
2315500	2316500	Post up quietly.
2317500	2319500	AC played Tim Raider.
2319500	2321500	Oh, that's fantastic.
2321500	2323500	I hope you guys enjoyed your Tim Raider.
2324500	2327500	More like Whim Raider when I'm done with her.
2329500	2333500	Thank you, my Yari, for becoming a member.
2333500	2335500	And thank you, Boy, for the...
2335500	2336500	Oh, my voice cracked.
2336500	2341500	Thank you, Boy, for the five gifted memberships.
2341500	2344500	Thank you, Boy, congrats to those who got the memberships.
2344500	2347500	You will have to exit the chat.
2347500	2349500	Or is that loud?
2349500	2350500	That's not too loud, is it?
2350500	2352500	I can hear that little bloop.
2354500	2356500	That bloop isn't loud, right?
2356500	2357500	No.
2357500	2358500	Oh, it's quiet.
2360500	2361500	Thank you so much.
2361500	2362500	It's really funny.
2362500	2364500	She raged a lot, but she was adorable.
2364500	2366500	She's so adorable.
2366500	2367500	Kusugaki.
2367500	2369500	That's missing from your life.
2369500	2371500	I love her accent so much.
2371500	2373500	Hi, Roller.
2373500	2375500	Thank you for the...
2376500	2377500	Pardon me.
2377500	2378500	Thank you for the super jab.
2378500	2382500	Any plans to do scripted ASMRs?
2382500	2385500	For the video tab for people who can't get to the streams?
2385500	2387500	Yes, hi, Roller.
2387500	2393500	I am so happy to say those uploads start today.
2395500	2397500	Oh, my tummy's rumbling.
2398500	2402500	My first meme ASMR is ready to be posted.
2402500	2405500	I am going to post it today.
2407500	2412500	And I also owe you, yes, you, listening right now,
2412500	2417500	four ASMR videos because for every 1,000...
2418500	2421500	For every 1,000 subscribers,
2422500	2427500	I will be uploading one celebration ASMR video,
2427500	2431500	all of different ideas, different tingles, different varieties.
2431500	2433500	And that starts today.
2434500	2437500	And for the replayings who are worried about
2438500	2443500	filtering, I already told you my master plan.
2443500	2445500	So don't worry.
2445500	2448500	I already know what happens next.
2451500	2454500	I filtered myself for you.
2456500	2460500	I had a year to plan our thing together.
2460500	2463500	I made sure to do it accordingly.
2464500	2467500	Yeah.
2469500	2472500	Thank you, Stroni, for bringing feeler into existence.
2472500	2475500	The gift of AC is something I'll never be able to play.
2475500	2477500	Replay, replay.
2477500	2479500	Thank you for everything.
2479500	2481500	Uchi-san, that's amazing.
2481500	2483500	I'm glad you can link AC.
2483500	2486500	You are definitely Uchi-san levels,
2486500	2490500	but if you're really good, AC may even call you daddy in her accent.
2491500	2496500	Thank you, Iki-to-emo no kuchi for becoming a member.
2496500	2499500	And thank you, Funky, for becoming a member.
2500500	2502500	Thank you very much.
2504500	2506500	Just as a reminder for members,
2506500	2510500	membership streams start next week
2511500	2515500	because the schedule for this week was pretty locked in.
2516500	2518500	And I just had a few background things.
2518500	2522500	I need to finish, but I'm like 100% sure.
2523500	2526500	By week three, I am officially-
2526500	2529500	I have no responsibilities of feeler,
2529500	2532500	and I am so freaking happy.
2534500	2537500	I'm gonna be lurking because I'm not workiest
2537500	2540500	where your audio sets so hard.
2541500	2544500	Have you ever thought about hypnotizing another girl a feeler?
2545500	2549500	She's welcome to listen to any of my audios at will.
2550500	2553500	I will not stop any of the girls,
2553500	2557500	but I would want to condition them to be a bit different.
2559500	2563500	Maybe not condition them to respond to replay,
2563500	2572500	but instead to let me make a certain audio with them.
2574500	2578500	Of my C theme of a right egg,
2578500	2580500	can you imagine?
2580500	2584500	C theme hypnosis on one of my daughters.
2586500	2587500	Oh, I-
2589500	2592500	Mommy, tomorrow, all the vehicular girls are together.
2592500	2595500	I'm so excited for a collab together.
2597500	2602500	Special shout out to MarySafe for streaming so early,
2602500	2604500	as Sarah for being early,
2604500	2605500	and me for being early,
2605500	2607500	she be for being early,
2607500	2609500	and I see for being later.
2609500	2612500	I- like, it's so hard to pick a time zone,
2612500	2613500	and I was like,
2613500	2618500	if you guys do me this favor and do it at my regular stream time,
2618500	2621500	I will repay you in more shorts.
2625500	2630500	If Johnny was streamed responsibly in 12 hours a day,
2630500	2634500	are you supposed to keep up after the third week?
2634500	2636500	Oh, that's the fun part.
2636500	2639500	The third week has four days of Elden Ring insurance streams,
2639500	2642500	because we need to play the DLC together.
2645500	2648500	Yeah, we have back to back to back to back
2648500	2651500	insurance streams on the third week,
2651500	2653500	because of Elden Ring.
2654500	2655500	Oh.
2659500	2662500	Curious, are you gonna do any non-gendered content?
2662500	2663500	I am so sorry.
2663500	2666500	I do he-him content,
2666500	2668500	and I apologize greatly.
2670500	2671500	I-
2672500	2676500	I don't want to say it simply gets harder to make the alternative content,
2676500	2679500	and thus, I make he-him.
2679500	2681500	I'm very sorry if that filler issue,
2681500	2685500	I completely understand if you no longer wish to watch,
2685500	2687500	because of that fact.
2687500	2691500	I don't know what the other girls were planning,
2691500	2696500	but I do know the name of some ASMR artists
2696500	2698500	that make female content.
2698500	2702500	One of them is a fan car ASMR, I believe.
2703500	2707500	She makes female for female content.
2708500	2709500	What's near last stream?
2709500	2710500	Congrats on monetization.
2710500	2711500	Thank you.
2711500	2713500	I'll start in your character with me.
2713500	2714500	Yeah.
2714500	2716500	Time to not sleep for a week.
2718500	2721500	Basically, week three is Elden Ring together,
2721500	2723500	and I'm gonna have my heart rate monitor
2723500	2725500	and a shock collar on,
2725500	2726500	and every time,
2728500	2731500	I cause us leaflings to lose the fight.
2732500	2735500	You guys get to shock me, basically,
2735500	2737500	and then on week four,
2737500	2740500	we're doing landscape endurance to get 99,
2740500	2743500	because I want to get 99 cooking,
2743500	2744500	and I will get it.
2744500	2747500	So, I believe on week four,
2747500	2750500	I will also tell you what movies we're doing,
2750500	2751500	watch alongs of,
2752500	2754500	so you guys can download it,
2754500	2758500	and I'll do the thing where I timestamp it on screen and all that.
2760500	2763500	Yeah, I watched some already, still enjoying your other content.
2763500	2764500	Yo, thank you so much.
2764500	2765500	I appreciate that,
2765500	2768500	and thank you for your understanding, surrounding it.
2768500	2772500	Mommy also sponsors other ASMRs.
2772500	2773500	You're so base.
2774500	2776500	I just want everyone to be,
2776500	2778500	I've literally forgotten to do tingles.
2778500	2780500	I'm just whispering at this point.
2780500	2785500	I just want everyone to be able to enjoy the content they consume,
2785500	2789500	and if that means I can help you find the person that speaks to you,
2790500	2791500	that Oshi,
2791500	2793500	or that person you really enjoy,
2793500	2794500	because like,
2794500	2797500	wait until I get done this rabbit hole, okay?
2797500	2800500	PS, thank you for the refling that encouraged me,
2800500	2803500	and marshmallow to go down all the rabbit holes I desire.
2803500	2805500	I will yank your ear off,
2805500	2807500	unapologetically from now on.
2809500	2812500	So, because of the way society is set up,
2812500	2816500	humans naturally need a face after work,
2816500	2819500	or after doing stressful situations.
2819500	2822500	A face can include alcohol,
2822500	2824500	a face can include smoking,
2824500	2827500	a face can include recreational drugs,
2827500	2831500	a face can include YouTubers,
2831500	2833500	feedubers, ASMR.
2833500	2836500	You should not be ashamed of what you need
2836500	2838500	to help you get through the day.
2838500	2841500	Humans are not set up for the society
2841500	2843500	that we are currently living in right now,
2843500	2846500	and I will scream that from the rooftops
2846500	2849500	to not ever be embarrassed at all
2849500	2852500	for what you need to do to get through the day.
2852500	2854500	A face is also music.
2854500	2857500	You may listen to Mongolian throat singing.
2857500	2861500	I will not judge you for listening to Mongolian throat singing, okay?
2862500	2867500	So, that is why I am not a jealous feature bird.
2867500	2869500	I want you to thrive.
2869500	2873500	I want your health to be as best as it can be,
2873500	2875500	if that means after work,
2875500	2878500	instead of watching a vote of mine.
2878500	2881500	For example, you watch another creator.
2881500	2884500	I am happy.
2884500	2886500	You are able to de-stress yourself.
2886500	2889500	You are able to regulate your nervous system.
2889500	2893500	You are able to look after yourself, okay?
2893500	2896500	Think of yourself like a Sims.
2896500	2899500	You unironically have bars of needs,
2899500	2903500	and what happens to a Sim when you ignore their needs?
2903500	2905500	Well, they start to lose it.
2905500	2908500	They start to have these unfortunate side effects.
2908500	2910500	They start to struggle with life.
2910500	2911500	They cannot function.
2911500	2914500	They cannot follow orders, okay?
2914500	2918500	So, please understand.
2918500	2920500	If you think to yourself right now,
2920500	2923500	Strawny, I don't think you're the one for me.
2923500	2927500	I implore you, my dear watcher.
2927500	2931500	Please check out the other VLR girls.
2931500	2933500	They may vibe with you better.
2933500	2938500	If you like brats who are jealous quick,
2938500	2941500	you may enjoy AC Snow Paws.
2941500	2947500	If you enjoy unhinged, unapologetic memos,
2947500	2951500	you may enjoy my M.A.B. Sue, okay?
2951500	2956500	If you love someone that has a similar personality to me,
2956500	2961500	but isn't me, my God, you're gonna love Sheebie Cottonbomb.
2961500	2966500	If you want to feel little, and you want to feel small,
2966500	2970500	you want to feel cared for, you want to feel appreciated,
2970500	2975500	and you want to hear the most sexy voice in all the land,
2975500	2982500	assuredly, if you want someone who can be energetic,
2982500	2988500	it's so fun, it's so just perfect, and our default laugh,
2988500	2995500	our laugh is natural, then you may love Mercy Moddies, okay?
2995500	2998500	And I'm just getting so happy talking about them,
2998500	3000500	I'm forgetting to whisper.
3000500	3003500	Please check them out in the description, okay?
3003500	3006500	Please, they deserve it.
3006500	3010500	They deserve a chance, the chance that you have given me,
3010500	3012500	give to them, okay?
3012500	3015500	Thank you, dear watcher.
3017500	3022500	Ah, the girls may struggle trying to watch everyone.
3022500	3027500	Yes, but those indulges so strong, yes.
3027500	3032500	Please indulge in my daughters at will.
3033500	3037500	I like virtual abuse, I can't deny it, yes.
3037500	3041500	Is there a new audio?
3041500	3044500	Wow!
3044500	3048500	What the heck?
3048500	3053500	Thank you for the 100, oh my God, reluctantly saying that's a lot of money.
3053500	3058500	Still no idea how so much awesome is contained in one cut of fish.
3058500	3062500	We adore your last and will pass it to the doors, thank you.
3062500	3065500	I really appreciate that.
3068500	3070500	Did I catch you off-guard?
3070500	3073500	Yeah, but you were distracted, weren't you?
3073500	3079500	Distracted by that no-no-by reluctantly saying, huh?
3079500	3083500	I completely caught you off-guard.
3083500	3086500	Did that cinch ever stand your spain?
3086500	3089500	Reef-laying, are you that sensitive?
3089500	3092500	That's adorable.
3095500	3100500	You can't fill us with emotional speech and then backstabbing.
3100500	3105500	But thank you again for the 100, yes.
3105500	3109500	You caught me killed in destiny, shivers through everything.
3109500	3112500	You made me die in Isaac.
3112500	3117500	Speaking of backstabber, did you know that backstabber is an item you can pick up in Isaac
3117500	3122500	which deals double damage to enemies if your tear goes on the back of them?
3122500	3128500	So if you have things like tiny planet, which rotates tears around you, it's quite effective,
3128500	3132500	but you kinda need the distance, you caught me-
3132500	3135500	I'm not reading that out.
3135500	3138500	Almost sent me over the edge.
3138500	3141500	10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.
3141500	3144500	Now I'm decent, we're not doing that.
3144500	3147500	That's for the membership streams.
3149500	3151500	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
3151500	3153500	Oh my god.
3153500	3155500	I'm kidding.
3155500	3157500	Reef-laying.
3160500	3162500	Don't be silly.
3162500	3164500	The painting of Isaac mentioned.
3164500	3168500	Never thought that Isaac combo, all the card.
3168500	3171500	You're kidding, but is she really?
3171500	3174500	What do you guys think about the emotes?
3174500	3178500	Has anyone found the secret to my emotes yet?
3178500	3180500	They're nostalgic.
3183500	3186500	I'm gonna get thy grip and stuff.
3186500	3190500	Every girl is doing great and they're really awesome, I'm happy.
3191500	3202500	I cannot even put into words how much amazing experience to have them.
3202500	3204500	It's just insane.
3204500	3206500	It's honestly insane.
3206500	3208500	I cannot believe the girls even applied.
3208500	3212500	And then they put up with my Scottish ass in the interview.
3212500	3217500	My interview technique is so unprofessional, it's not even funny.
3220500	3223500	I need to grind and RuneScape to help my main cooking supplies.
3223500	3225500	We have an insurance stream.
3225500	3231500	I'm just gonna yap and do Marshmallow, Queer, U.S. Jens during the RuneScape stream.
3231500	3235500	So feel free, I'll do a tweet about answering questions during the RuneScape.
3235500	3238500	I'm sure it'll lead me down some rubber holes.
3241500	3244500	Just realized Ronnie would do bleep damage.
3244500	3246500	I like painting things.
3246500	3248500	This is your warning.
3248500	3250500	You're in or you're out, refling.
3254500	3258500	Oh, hydration check, I've not had any liquid today.
3270500	3272500	All gone, daddy.
3279500	3285500	Okay, maybe I should actually clean your ears a little.
3290500	3293500	Debate marks show people that you own us.
3295500	3296500	Good girl.
3297500	3299500	Thank you.
3301500	3305500	I may or may not have drunk in so much whiskey.
3306500	3309500	Oh, you need to be careful, whiskey'll get you drunk.
3309500	3314500	Although, if there's any Belgian slurking, Belgian beer gets you drunk.
3314500	3317500	I had one Belgian beer and I was tipsy.
3317500	3319500	I didn't even finish it.
3319500	3320500	I was tipsy.
3320500	3322500	I'm like so late.
3322500	3325500	Late, wait, wait, what's that term?
3325500	3328500	Late, wait, wait, that's not the term.
3328500	3331500	I'm so late, wait, I can hardly handle alcohol.
3331500	3334500	What the heck is that word?
3334500	3337500	Late, wait, why is my drink?
3337500	3340500	Late, wait, oh, just dropped the E.T.
3340500	3345500	Okay, sorry, I'm so late, wait, drinker.
3345500	3347500	Wait, why is that so confusing?
3347500	3349500	It's late, wait.
3350500	3354500	Those three words, if I stand up, my desk will come with me.
3354500	3357500	I love so much catching you guys off guard.
3357500	3359500	I don't know why it's so satisfying.
3359500	3362500	Like, I can be so wholesome talking to you.
3362500	3365500	Like, saying all these, like, just talking in general.
3365500	3367500	And then I come up with three words and you're gone.
3367500	3370500	Like, ah, don't give me that power.
3370500	3371500	Don't do it.
3371500	3375500	It's over for both of us if you give me that power.
3375500	3378500	The less you wait, the drunker you get.
3378500	3380500	I don't even know how much I wait.
3380500	3384500	I wonder if you guys can really pinch press me.
3384500	3387500	Are you planning on making role-play audios in the future?
3387500	3388500	Yes.
3388500	3389500	I have a role-play coming out.
3389500	3392500	It's a meme though, but the other ones are role-plays.
3393500	3395500	But I have a meme role-play.
3397500	3401500	Yeah, the both of us, me and you, we fling.
3404500	3407500	It was over before we began.
3407500	3410500	I could deadlift you for sure.
3410500	3412500	I can branch press you with ease.
3412500	3415500	Can't pinch press, can't pinch press, can't pinch press.
3415500	3421500	Someone sent me a very naughty, naughty marshmallow.
3422500	3424500	They were like...
3426500	3430500	They were like, I go to the gym so I can pinch you.
3432500	3434500	Into a wall.
3436500	3438500	And I'll leave it at that.
3440500	3443500	I'm afraid you had that power all along.
3446500	3448500	Nice.
3449500	3452500	I probably can't pinch press you, but I can do a different press.
3457500	3460500	I have crushed a watermelon between my thighs.
3460500	3462500	You'll be much different.
3462500	3465500	The inspiration to get more fat.
3465500	3469500	I go to the gym for the Phil Nelson.
3469500	3473500	You'll never guess why I'm so flexible, really.
3473500	3475500	I'd say you can Nelson me.
3484500	3487500	I brushy brushy your ear.
3489500	3492500	Okay, let me check marshmallows.
3493500	3495500	My little marshmallows.
3497500	3499500	Have I got a new one?
3500500	3502500	Wow.
3503500	3508500	I've been massively into hypnosis for ages now,
3508500	3512500	but I've never been able to find someone who's voice I love.
3512500	3516500	And now I finally get someone who's both a nurses streamer.
3516500	3520500	And I can watch for Arizona in long story short.
3520500	3523500	Thanks. Keep doing what you're doing.
3523500	3525500	You're doing amazing. Thank you.
3525500	3530500	I honestly thought my Scottish accent would be a bit of a barrier,
3530500	3533500	but I am very glad to hear it now.
3533500	3535500	Feels good, man.
3535500	3540500	That's right, you are falling under my spell.
3540500	3543500	You're not, you're not, you're not.
3549500	3553500	I was wondering if there's an official public Twitter list.
3553500	3557500	No, you have to go find the alternative twitters.
3557500	3559500	We can't link to them.
3559500	3561500	Against the rules.
3561500	3563500	Sorry.
3563500	3566500	I didn't, I didn't create the game.
3566500	3568500	I just play it, okay?
3568500	3571500	So the girls can't link to the alternatives.
3571500	3572500	Sorry.
3572500	3576500	Just check who the girls follow on Twitter.
3580500	3582500	Thank you.
3584500	3588500	Someone says, have I done professional voice acting?
3588500	3589500	No.
3589500	3593500	Do I sound like I do professional voice acting?
3595500	3598500	What do you even do when you go to a meeting?
3598500	3601500	Like, what even occurs?
3601500	3603500	I assume they tell you what vocal warm-ups are.
3603500	3605500	Like...
3605500	3607500	Or something like that.
3607500	3609500	Donate the player, I hate the game.
3609500	3610500	Yeah.
3611500	3614500	I wonder if I can get double hypnotized.
3615500	3617500	Can you say burglary?
3617500	3618500	I haven't.
3618500	3623500	I wonder, can we get one stream without someone asking for a purple burglary alarm?
3623500	3627500	But yes, I can say it, but if I'm in my heavy accent,
3627500	3629500	then...
3629500	3631500	Wait, can I whisper into a heavy accent?
3631500	3633500	Purple burglary.
3634500	3636500	Hala!
3636500	3640500	It's funny because right now they're all some more followers than their mates.
3640500	3644500	Oh, we know what the people want, we give it for free.
3644500	3650500	When other VTubers are being greedy, free.
3650500	3654500	Come home, viewer.
3654500	3657500	Reject capitalism.
3657500	3660500	Reject corporate greed.
3660500	3667500	We'll look after you, even if you don't give us a penny.
3667500	3674500	Shhh, it's okay, I know, I know it's a hard concept.
3674500	3678500	Did I talk about that on my 2.0?
3678500	3685500	Someone was like, feeler is gonna fail because of the 80-20 split.
3685500	3691500	And it's like, oh you poor sweet summer child.
3691500	3699500	You are so deep that you can't imagine a successful business without corporate greed.
3699500	3704500	Shhh, it's okay, it's okay, you've been brainwashed.
3704500	3707500	I'll undo the damage.
3707500	3714500	And together, we've got a city to burn.
3714500	3718500	We're gonna wipe the dust out of everyone.
3718500	3721500	The whole world will no longer be.
3721500	3726500	Okay, that's it, we're watching Fate Club again.
3726500	3731500	You wonder why Fate Club is one of my favorite movies.
3731500	3736500	Not just because of the race-nove plot.
3736500	3741500	It sounds like Silverheart based.
3741500	3744500	It's joining Hypnosis Stream, breaking capitalism,
3744500	3747500	mind-washing you to show you you can be successful without greed.
3747500	3750500	Yes.
3750500	3752500	I'm glad we got based.
3752500	3758500	Encourage people to give when they already get a taste.
3758500	3761500	277 playthrough, I've never actually played the game.
3761500	3763500	I'd like to try it together.
3763500	3768500	Never seen Fate Club or we're watching it again, baby.
3768500	3771500	We are watching Fate Club again.
3771500	3774500	Hammer and Scythe, oh no, that's actually,
3774500	3779500	I am going to take you about region-locked capitalism.
3779500	3782500	So before capitalism, there's this thing called Fatuism.
3782500	3784500	I can't remember it.
3784500	3787500	But basically, it's just region-locked capitalism.
3787500	3788500	It's freaking crazy.
3788500	3790500	I wanna do a massive deep dive into it.
3790500	3793500	And like seriously, if you start learning about history
3793500	3795500	and how humans were before,
3795500	3799500	the quicker we are all going to get a farm together
3799500	3802500	and all the reflicks come on the farm with me.
3802500	3804500	And we have chickens.
3804500	3807500	And we have protein from the eggs of the chickens.
3807500	3810500	And we grow our own produce.
3810500	3816500	And we realize quickly that you need community to survive.
3816500	3820500	Because if you are telling, sorry, I'm going down the rebel,
3820500	3827500	you're telling me that all these companies are recording record profits.
3827500	3830500	And we're going to cause the living crisis.
3830500	3832500	But it's not artificial.
3832500	3836500	And all the farmers say that nothing has changed in their production line.
3836500	3839500	Hell yeah, we've got a city of burn.
3839500	3841500	We're going to do it right fucking there.
3843500	3846500	Oh, don't get me started.
3846500	3849500	Don't do it briefly.
3850500	3852500	Calm.
3853500	3856500	Keep me calm, refling.
3857500	3860500	Keep me calm.
3864500	3866500	It's okay.
3867500	3869500	It's okay.
3874500	3878500	Just a question, can you watch movies on membership streams?
3878500	3880500	Boy, you are getting spoiled for that.
3880500	3883500	I absolutely love sharing movies.
3883500	3886500	And watching them for the first time.
3886500	3890500	I'm going to be watching Austin Powers for the first time.
3890500	3893500	Cause you guys are drawing me.
3893500	3897500	Saying that Fond de la Buseau is an Austin Powers enemy name.
3897500	3901500	So we're watching Austin Powers for the first time.
3902500	3905500	Um, yeah.
3905500	3909500	We love when you go Gremlin mode.
3909500	3912500	It's okay, Strani. You'll get on one day.
3912500	3913500	Yeah.
3913500	3915500	Feral aggressive ASMR.
3915500	3918500	Well, I did bait in the ear ASMR.
3918500	3921500	Like actually grivelling at the mic and bait in the ear.
3921500	3925500	But it's going to have to be a Twitter video.
3925500	3930500	Uh, your infantry anti-capitalist ASMR with soft kisses.
3930500	3931500	Yeah.
3931500	3935500	See, wait until you get further into the rabbit hole.
3935500	3940500	So on an individual scale, it's good to not be in debt.
3940500	3943500	For the way that the economy is set up.
3943500	3946500	They want you to be in debt.
3946500	3948500	And wait until you're the kicker.
3948500	3953500	Mortgages, 30 year, 25 year mortgages.
3953500	3956500	Or just normalize debt.
3956500	3958500	You don't own that house.
3958500	3962500	For 25 years, for 30 years, you're in debt.
3962500	3966500	We need to bring back multi-generational households.
3966500	3968500	Okay.
3968500	3970500	That needs to be brought back.
3970500	3972500	But they aren't going to let you do that.
3972500	3979500	Why do you think one business on 60% of the fricking proper ace in America
3979500	3980500	How can I listen?
3980500	3988500	Okay, shh, ASMR, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, ASMR.
3988500	3991500	Relax.
3995500	3997500	It's okay.
3999500	4006500	I can't tell if I'm saying it's okay for you, refling, or it's okay for me to calm down.
4006500	4009500	You know what, listen to my heart.
4009500	4014500	It's time to listen to my heart so you can hear how fricking serious I am.
4014500	4016500	Right, are you ready?
4016500	4020500	Oh, let me, I'm lifting up my hoodie for you, refling.
4028500	4031500	It's okay, refling.
4032500	4037500	Let's go on a journey together.
4037500	4041500	We'll go on a farm, alright?
4041500	4044500	And I'll be over a farm.
4044500	4047500	And we'll have chickens.
4047500	4049500	And we'll have ducks.
4049500	4056500	Because ducks are good for eating slugs and bugs that are the crops.
4057500	4060500	And there'll be a big pond.
4060500	4064500	And the ducks will be so happy.
4064500	4068500	And we can go on a big walk around the farm.
4068500	4073500	And I'll show you all my seed collection because it'll be so big.
4073500	4080500	And I get to grow nasturtials.
4080500	4085500	I get to put nasturtials all around the garden.
4085500	4088500	And there'll be so many bees.
4088500	4090500	Lots of bees.
4090500	4093500	And bugs.
4093500	4100500	Maybe, just maybe we may even have honey bugs.
4100500	4106500	And we'll grow lots of native flowers that are good for all the wildlife.
4106500	4109500	And there'll be birds.
4109500	4112500	And cami will come.
4113500	4118500	And we'll have lots of magpie families.
4118500	4124500	And in the end, everything will be okay, refling.
4124500	4127500	Because it always works out in the end.
4127500	4130500	Doesn't it?
4130500	4133500	It took me a year to get here.
4133500	4137500	To get back to where we were.
4137500	4141500	And here we are.
4141500	4144500	All the stress.
4144500	4146500	The worry.
4146500	4147500	The doubt.
4147500	4151500	The doubt if I could even be here.
4151500	4153500	And we did it.
4153500	4155500	We did it.
4159500	4163500	It took us so long.
4163500	4170500	I hope it feels like it was no time at all.
4170500	4174500	And I didn't take long.
4174500	4178500	And it was a blink of an eye.
4178500	4181500	No more waiting.
4181500	4184500	No more yearning.
4184500	4186500	Me and you.
4186500	4191500	To the man.
4191500	4195500	I wish I had made you sooner.
4195500	4197500	Oh, don't worry.
4197500	4200500	I am strong in cuddles.
4200500	4202500	And you are my refling.
4202500	4209500	And that is all we need.
4209500	4213500	It feels good to be home.
4213500	4216500	Feels good to be home.
4216500	4220500	My little refling.
4220500	4224500	I love you.
4224500	4226500	Okay, next.
4226500	4230500	I need to milk you.
4230500	4233500	You're being so patient.
4240500	4243500	I hope you stay for a long time.
4243500	4246500	Have you got three years?
4246500	4250500	I think I've got three years.
4250500	4252500	You are my favorite person.
4252500	4254500	I love you.
4257500	4260500	You can't keep getting away with that.
4260500	4262500	I love you too.
4262500	4265500	Let me pet your other ear.
4271500	4273500	What was that at the end?
4273500	4275500	Nothing.
4275500	4278500	What happens after three years?
4278500	4280500	I don't know.
4282500	4284500	I just thought...
4284500	4286500	I don't know.
4286500	4288500	I don't know what happens.
4290500	4293500	We don't have to think about that now, okay?
4297500	4300500	You have me for the next 100.
4302500	4305500	She's gonna evolve.
4305500	4307500	I could, if you want.
4307500	4310500	Or, if you want, what we pretend to be.
4310500	4313500	And who will pretend to be A.C.
4313500	4316500	And my new persona.
4316500	4318500	Hello, guys.
4318500	4320500	I'm A.C. Snow Falls.
4320500	4324500	And today, we are going to...
4324500	4326500	Do ASMR.
4326500	4328500	What? I'm not strannic couples.
4328500	4330500	Stop calling me strannic couples.
4330500	4332500	I'm not strannic.
4332500	4334500	I don't even know who that is.
4338500	4341500	I can't really do a lighter voice.
4341500	4343500	Light eyes.
4343500	4345500	Light eyes.
4345500	4347500	Light strannic couples.
4349500	4351500	Monster HMC.
4351500	4353500	Thank you for becoming a member.
4355500	4360500	Oh, the bread's really evolving to biblically accurate strannic.
4364500	4366500	Oh my god, that's so adorable.
4366500	4368500	That urge to A.
4368500	4371500	Are you gonna ink to my RP?
4371500	4373500	Free-flying?
4373500	4376500	Even I admit that's a bit general.
4380500	4385500	What was cute when I tried to pretend to be A.C.?
4385500	4389500	I would need to watch more of A.C.'s streams.
4389500	4391500	To mimic her accent.
4391500	4395500	But I really fell in love with A.C.'s accent.
4395500	4397500	Sorry, my voice is a bit damaged.
4397500	4400500	So it's harder for me to talk.
4405500	4407500	Why am I roleplaying as Casey?
4416500	4418500	Have you missed me?
4418500	4420500	Did you watch my Tomb Raider stream?
4422500	4424500	Wait.
4424500	4428500	You didn't watch my Tomb Raider stream, A.C.
4428500	4431500	But you only watched my ASMR?
4431500	4435500	You don't like me, do you, A.C.?
4435500	4437500	You disgust me.
4438500	4443500	If you were a real A.C., you'd watch everything.
4443500	4445500	But you don't.
4446500	4448500	You forget to subscribe to me.
4448500	4451500	You forget to like the streams, A.C.
4452500	4454500	I think you need punishment.
4455500	4457500	Yes.
4457500	4459500	A.C. sun.
4460500	4462500	Sit on the floor.
4463500	4465500	Open your legs, A.C. sun.
4467500	4469500	What do you mean?
4469500	4471500	What am I doing with my boot?
4472500	4476500	I'm punishing you, A.C. sun.
4481500	4485500	Is that weird to roleplay as my genmys?
4485500	4487500	I think that's a bit odd.
4490500	4492500	I think that was rather odd with me.
4492500	4494500	I'm not sure if that was weird.
4495500	4497500	A.C. will laugh at that.
4497500	4499500	I hope so.
4499500	4501500	Sorry, my voice is very broken.
4502500	4506500	Whenever I do ASMR, my voice gets so broken.
4507500	4509500	I think A.C. will like your jokes on you.
4509500	4511500	I'm into that.
4511500	4513500	Turned an issue beyond the hint.
4513500	4515500	Mercy next.
4515500	4517500	Oh, Mercy, I can't do it.
4519500	4521500	Surprise!
4521500	4523500	Surprise!
4523500	4525500	She's so energetic.
4527500	4529500	Hypnotized to believe I'm A.C.
4531500	4534500	I wonder what TV is, audio I could make.
4536500	4538500	It's called voice acting.
4539500	4541500	Anyway, thank you A.C. for coming on stream.
4541500	4543500	I do appreciate that.
4545500	4547500	This is exactly why A.C. streams.
4547500	4549500	Can you?
4549500	4551500	I can't believe it.
4551500	4553500	I pretend I'm A.C.
4553500	4555500	and I already...
4557500	4559500	I'm already getting my thoughts new.
4560500	4563500	Who are you and what have you done with Strani?
4563500	4565500	I'm back.
4565500	4567500	All flower is gone.
4569500	4571500	When will we see?
4571500	4573500	You're late again.
4575500	4577500	So I'm to die for and proud Edwards army.
4579500	4581500	Can you do a Strani couple's impression?
4589500	4591500	Why do you think A.C. redirected into me?
4591500	4593500	I am A.C.
4593500	4595500	I am A.C.
4595500	4597500	I am A.C.
4597500	4599500	I almost just made a noise if you heard that.
4599500	4601500	I am A.C.
4601500	4603500	I am A.C.
4603500	4605500	I am Mercy.
4605500	4607500	They're all me.
4607500	4609500	Don't you get it?
4609500	4611500	I win.
4611500	4613500	You lose.
4613500	4615500	I love you, Strani.
4615500	4617500	I'll catch up with the Vots since I love the ASMR.
4617500	4619500	Thank you, Tainee, Spani.
4619500	4621500	Let's see if you remember how to say my name this time.
4621500	4623500	Oh god, I'm so sorry.
4623500	4625500	Tainee, Spani.
4625500	4627500	Tainee, Spani.
4627500	4629500	Spain, E.
4629500	4631500	Tainee, Spani.
4631500	4633500	Thank you for the tips.
4633500	4635500	I love the ASMR content.
4635500	4637500	Please, let's see if you remember.
4637500	4639500	OBS, let's see if you remember.
4639500	4641500	Tainee, Spain, E.
4642000	4643500	I am Fielder.
4643500	4645500	I wish I could do a manic laughter right now.
4645500	4647500	Tainee, Spain, E.
4647500	4649500	I am Fielder.
4649500	4651500	I wish I could do a manic laughter right now.
4651500	4653500	Sorry, that was quite loud.
4653500	4655500	D'you even hear my heartbeat?
4655500	4657500	D'you even hear my heartbeat?
4657500	4659500	You remembered.
4659500	4661500	I'm so proud of you.
4661500	4663500	D'you even hear my heartbeat?
4663500	4665500	You remembered.
4665500	4667500	I'm so proud of you.
4667500	4669500	Yeah.
4669500	4672300	Have you ever seen us in the same stream together?
4672300	4673800	No, you haven't.
4676700	4678200	My beloved skizzle cutouts!
4678200	4679200	Yay!
4680400	4681400	Skizzle mode.
4684200	4687200	We're gaining your personality,
4687200	4689900	any pieces identified.
4692400	4693400	Onee-chan.
4695600	4696600	Onee-chan.
4700500	4702500	Listen, I can tell us.
4705000	4706000	Onee-chan.
4706000	4707000	Onee-chan.
4707000	4709000	I love you, Onee-chan.
4711000	4712500	I missed you.
4714000	4716000	I can't do it. Why is it so hard?
4717000	4718000	Let's go.
4718000	4719000	Let's go again.
4720500	4722500	There's no way I can do Isara.
4724000	4725000	Hello?
4725000	4725500	No.
4725500	4727500	Isara is too low for me.
4727500	4729500	She's so far too low.
4731500	4732500	Well...
4733500	4735500	I'm trying to mimic her accent as well,
4735500	4736500	because she has a...
4737500	4738500	It's not on me.
4738500	4742500	I only use my brain cells to calibrate onee, you see?
4742500	4745500	Give me a sentence for Isara to say.
4748500	4751500	Oh dear, bleeding hearts.
4752500	4754500	It's been so long.
4754500	4756500	My voice is cracking,
4756500	4758500	but I'm kind of there.
4760500	4762500	You've done me so well,
4762500	4764500	as a goddess waiting.
4765500	4766500	It's not that.
4767500	4768500	Hey sweetie.
4769500	4771500	Yeah, Isara is impossible.
4771500	4773500	You sound like you're dying.
4778500	4782500	You sound like you're dying trying to mimic your tone.
4783500	4785500	I've missed you.
4785500	4786500	My bleeding.
4789500	4791500	My voice is a bit too soft.
4791500	4793500	I apologise.
4794500	4796500	You can't just build on each unguard.
4797500	4800500	Oh, it's like literally my top one kick.
4802500	4806500	I'm like, it's like, that has to be tier one for me.
4808500	4810500	What would the second be?
4812500	4814500	The other whole, yeah.
4814500	4815500	Yeah.
4816500	4818500	Try Sheebie.
4820500	4821500	Try.
4821500	4823500	Sheebie's deeper than me, I think.
4823500	4825500	I can't do Sheebie.
4827500	4829500	Have you been a good boy?
4830500	4832500	That's not how Sheebie says.
4835500	4837500	It's because she's a deeper tone.
4837500	4838500	I'm so sorry.
4842500	4845500	Wait, what did Sheebie say?
4847500	4849500	Oh, Heron.
4850500	4851500	Oh, Heron.
4852500	4854500	Oh, Heron.
4857500	4859500	Oh, I can't do it.
4859500	4860500	She'd be from Wish.
4860500	4861500	You don't fuck you.
4867500	4869500	You need to call a trash.
4870500	4871500	You are trash.
4871500	4873500	Nothing but trash.
4877500	4878500	Mercy.
4878500	4879500	Mercy.
4879500	4881500	Mercy's higher pitched than me.
4882500	4884500	Senpai's like misty so much.
4887500	4888500	Senpai.
4891500	4893500	My voice is cracking on the giggle.
4895500	4897500	Oh, that's pretty bad,
4897500	4899500	cracking on the giggle.
4900500	4902500	Senpai's.
4904500	4907500	Did you miss me, Senpai's?
4909500	4913500	I'm not even going to pretend that I can do any Vietnamese.
4917500	4919500	Try her Yandere laugh.
4921500	4923500	Wait, I'll lower my volume.
4923500	4926500	I'll see if I can do it in the same laugh like Mercy.
4927500	4928500	Okay.
4937500	4938500	There we go.
4939500	4941500	Igor, thank you for the...
4942500	4945500	Wait a minute, Igor, aren't you from my puzzle stream?
4946500	4950500	Remember when Yumi confessed that she pooped herself before the stream?
4950500	4952500	That was just strong, even.
4952500	4954500	Thank you for the 5, Igor.
4954500	4959500	I'm pretty sure you're from that puzzle game, because I see rated into me.
4959500	4963500	And then everyone started saying Igor, and I was like, what the heck is Igor?
4963500	4966500	And then everyone said it was from the puzzle game.
4966500	4968500	And I was like, oh yeah, that's a puzzle game.
4968500	4970500	Yes, I watched it.
4974500	4976500	This one says you're scaring me.
4976500	4979500	I told you, I'm all a violour, you don't trust me?
4979500	4981500	You didn't even believe me?
4981500	4985500	Just because I've got a Scottish accent doesn't mean I can't mimic your waifu.
4986500	4987500	It's okay.
4987500	4990500	You're allowed to be scared, aren't you?
4991500	4993500	Oh, did you hear that whistle as I breathed in there?
4993500	4994500	I love you.
4995500	4998500	Your voice actually kind of works on the food.
4998500	5001500	Of course my voice works.
5001500	5005500	Everything I do works.
5005500	5009500	Everything I touch succeeds.
5009500	5011500	Don't you understand?
5011500	5014500	I control all of this.
5014500	5018500	If I want to live, I live.
5018500	5021500	If I want to take, I take.
5021500	5027500	And if I want you to die, you die.
5027500	5030500	That was an Assassin's Creed Brotherhood quote, by the way.
5030500	5032500	Please do not panic.
5032500	5034500	Hydration check.
5035500	5038500	I feel like you could tell whether it's strawny or someone else's voice.
5038500	5040500	Swing!
5040500	5042500	Strawny, you just can't have your way.
5042500	5044500	Hydration check, okay.
5051500	5056500	I have my finger in all the pies, my tentacles, and everywhere.
5059500	5062500	Can you please touch the side even?
5064500	5067500	There's only so much I love what color fish would do.
5067500	5071500	Okay, I'll go back to whispering because my voice doesn't crack when I whisper for some reason.
5071500	5076500	But if I try and do so, I've spoken ASMR, it's just like completely messed up.
5076500	5078500	Much love, do you?
5078500	5079500	Oh, yeah.
5079500	5081500	Was that a swing from Queen's World?
5081500	5083500	Yeah, I've never seen it.
5083500	5085500	I've just seen meme complete.
5085500	5088500	Like the highlights and the echo swing.
5090500	5092500	Good memories from Assassin's Creed.
5092500	5093500	Oh, yeah.
5093500	5098500	Once that we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on the tenth of June, can't wait to see you there.
5102500	5105500	Oh, yeah, definitely a motion that was nothing else.
5105500	5106500	Yeah.
5114500	5116500	By the pool.
5123500	5125500	Wow!
5125500	5127500	Congrats on the interview.
5127500	5129500	I hope it went well.
5129500	5130500	Thank you, Grandpa.
5130500	5133500	That's very kind of you to give a tip.
5133500	5134500	You don't have to do that.
5134500	5136500	And just share the wealth.
5136500	5138500	Share the load.
5138500	5141500	If you didn't know, there's a quote in Lord of the Rings.
5141500	5143500	We're so anguished at photo.
5143500	5146500	Share the load.
5146500	5148500	You'd share your load with me, right?
5148500	5149500	Reef one.
5153500	5155500	Thank you again, Grandpa, for the chip.
5155500	5157500	I appreciate it.
5158500	5160500	And I go for the super chat.
5160500	5162500	I don't think I said that.
5163500	5164500	You said insurance.
5164500	5166500	Sorry, my tummy's rumbling.
5166500	5168500	I haven't eaten anything.
5168500	5171500	You said insurance agent.
5171500	5173500	Okay.
5173500	5175500	I wonder what that's like.
5175500	5176500	Are you gonna be on the phone?
5176500	5177500	I wonder.
5177500	5180500	But yeah, you don't actually have to share your wealth.
5180500	5182500	Make sure your bills are paid.
5182500	5184500	Make sure your bills are paid.
5184500	5186500	And then any debts.
5186500	5189500	And then if you are in the position to dip or donate,
5189500	5191500	please consider a dollar first.
5191500	5195500	If you can only do one, always pick a dollar over me.
5195500	5197500	I produce free content all the time.
5197500	5199500	You just have to let me cook.
5201500	5205500	Yeah, you're making me make noises.
5205500	5206500	Go down.
5207500	5209500	How do you think the girls were made?
5211500	5214500	Share the wealth and photos face me,
5214500	5216500	Greg's bill.
5216500	5219500	Stoney, that was too powerful.
5219500	5222500	Like, I like catching you off-card.
5222500	5225500	One minute, you think I'm about to narrow down
5225500	5227500	about Lord of the Rings.
5227500	5231500	Next minute, your tentacle is up.
5234500	5237500	Nice try, but I need my energy today.
5237500	5239500	Okay, let me refresh my marshmallow.
5239500	5241500	Ah, there's marshmallows.
5241500	5242500	Thank you.
5242500	5243500	Hi, Stoney.
5243500	5244500	First, I love you.
5244500	5246500	I love your red light.
5246500	5249500	Secondly, I have two movies that I would give my life,
5249500	5250500	not for you to watch.
5250500	5254500	Please keep it and remember to eat anything with tomatoes in it.
5254500	5256500	More tomato, the better for your boss.
5256500	5258500	Napoleon Dynamite.
5258500	5260500	I've never seen that.
5260500	5262500	This is one of my favorite movies.
5262500	5265500	It's a unique indie movie that is weird in the best way possible.
5265500	5270500	The other one would be Talladega Night.
5270500	5272500	Talladega Night.
5272500	5273500	What?
5275500	5277500	Talladega Night.
5277500	5280500	And it's a comedy that's really goofy and fun.
5280500	5284500	Yeah, I'm 100% open to movie suggestions.
5284500	5288500	I'm going to see if I can push three membership streams.
5288500	5291500	One by default is a watch along.
5291500	5295500	One by default is ASMR membership.
5295500	5299500	And then a third one is either a short video game,
5299500	5302500	a game we might have already played before,
5302500	5307500	or maybe a multiplayer stream-snap kind of experience.
5307500	5312500	But yeah, please don't be afraid to suggest things you want to see.
5312500	5315500	I am very open to any suggestions of content.
5315500	5317500	I don't mind at all.
5317500	5319500	Some feed chippers might not like it.
5319500	5320500	I do not mind at all.
5320500	5322500	I'd love to deliver what you seek.
5322500	5326500	Thank you for your nice message.
5326500	5328500	Princess Breed.
5328500	5331500	How open to your horror movies?
5331500	5334500	I'm 100% open to horror movies.
5334500	5337500	I'll even wear my heart rate monitor if you like.
5337500	5339500	I don't mind at all.
5341500	5345500	Sounds like you're going to love Cyberpunk 27.7.
5345500	5348500	You're just like Johnny Silverhand.
5348500	5350500	Johnny Silverhand?
5350500	5353500	Oh, if he wants to burn down society.
5353500	5357500	Okay, I'm going to enjoy Cyberpunk.
5360500	5366500	I wish I got the super and then I got censored kind of smart autism.
5366500	5369500	But I'm stuck with a pro wrestling fan autism.
5369500	5371500	It's okay, brother.
5371500	5374500	Much old man Randy Savage.
5374500	5380500	I used to watch The Stinger or The Wasp as a child.
5380500	5383500	So don't worry if you like pro wrestling.
5383500	5385500	I know some names.
5385500	5387500	Yeah.
5387500	5389500	Society.
5389500	5391500	Society.
5391500	5394500	I think it's society.
5394500	5396500	Yeah, sorry.
5396500	5398500	Society.
5398500	5400500	Society.
5400500	5402500	Society.
5403500	5405500	Anonymous.
5406500	5408500	Why?
5409500	5412500	Why 100 with no message?
5413500	5416500	Anon, what the fuck?
5416500	5418500	Thank you.
5418500	5420500	What the fuck?
5420500	5422500	Why so much money?
5422500	5424500	Thank you for the 100.
5424500	5426500	What the fuck Anon?
5426500	5431500	And no, do not donate to put a message that says nothing.
5431500	5433500	So Brian reads out nothing.
5433500	5435500	I know exactly what you're doing.
5435500	5439500	I can see you smiling to yourself,
5439500	5443500	being all proud that you dipped without a message.
5443500	5445500	I see you.
5445500	5447500	Don't think I don't.
5447500	5449500	I'm staring into your soul.
5449500	5450500	Don't do it.
5450500	5453500	Bad Anon, bad boy.
5453500	5459500	You're a bad, bad man, Anon.
5459500	5463500	Do you know what happens to bad men?
5463500	5467500	They need punishment.
5467500	5469500	That's a A.C. bring your boot in.
5469500	5471500	How is it my turn again?
5471500	5473500	Yay, boot time.
5473500	5475500	Good.
5475500	5477500	Anon.
5477500	5479500	Anon.
5479500	5481500	What did I say?
5481500	5483500	What did I fucking say, Anon?
5483500	5485500	I called it.
5485500	5487500	You were already freaking typing it in the box.
5487500	5489500	Thank you for the tip, Anon.
5489500	5491500	No, do not.
5491500	5493500	No, do not.
5493500	5495500	I'm ginger too.
5495500	5497500	I'm ginger too,
5497500	5499500	although someone said it looked like a war mill.
5499500	5501500	And I was like, honestly, I don't care.
5501500	5503500	It looked like a war mill.
5503500	5505500	You call me there.
5505500	5507500	Tips refuses to call me.
5507500	5509500	It leaves, literally.
5509500	5511500	I don't know what to do.
5511500	5513500	I'm getting second feelings of scolding.
5513500	5515500	Should I do scolding ASMR?
5515500	5517500	Should I do scolding ASMR?
5517500	5519500	I'm an actual fucking agent.
5519500	5521500	What the fuck are you mean?
5521500	5523500	I can't hear you.
5523500	5525500	Don't make a noise for the rest of the night.
5525500	5527500	I actually can't believe that embarrassment.
5527500	5529500	You, of course, made it on the playground today.
5529500	5531500	What do you want me to drink?
5531500	5533500	What do you want me to drink?
5533500	5535500	Do you know what they say?
5535500	5537500	We've got to say it in Scotland.
5537500	5539500	Is this Lassie Bashers?
5539500	5541500	You're not supposed to be a Lassie Bashers.
5541500	5543500	I didn't leave.
5543500	5545500	Don't scare me while I get there.
5545500	5547500	This is actually true in Scotland.
5547500	5549500	On the playground,
5549500	5551500	you're told not to hit girls.
5551500	5553500	And the way you're told not to hit girls
5553500	5555500	is you get called
5555500	5557500	a Lassie Basher.
5557500	5559500	This is true.
5559500	5561500	Any Scots lurking
5561500	5563500	know what a Lassie Basher is.
5563500	5565500	You'll basically get called a Lassie Basher
5565500	5567500	and bullied and picked on
5567500	5569500	for hitting girls you do not hit girls
5569500	5571500	in Scotland.
5571500	5573500	And then,
5573500	5575500	wait until you look at
5575500	5577500	the domestic violence rates.
5577500	5579500	Lassie Bashers
5579500	5581500	doesn't work.
5581500	5583500	Which one of you
5583500	5585500	took a shit
5585500	5587500	and did they push that tie line?
5587500	5589500	Don't bash my Lassies.
5589500	5591500	I got most of that
5591500	5593500	and enjoyed it.
5593500	5595500	I literally, oh that was my collar
5595500	5597500	cracking if you heard that.
5597500	5599500	I have many movies
5599500	5601500	are we playing in advance?
5601500	5603500	Are we having any moves
5603500	5605500	are you playing in advance on this big chess game?
5605500	5607500	Notting in nothing
5607500	5609500	can stop you.
5609500	5611500	Oh, I learned long ago
5611500	5613500	if you ever stream
5613500	5615500	or make primary content
5615500	5617500	ASMR and then you deviate
5617500	5619500	from that
5619500	5621500	people are like
5621500	5623500	waste ASMR, waste ASMR
5623500	5625500	and then they filter themselves
5625500	5627500	so I took that knowledge
5627500	5629500	of your little wifling.
5629500	5631500	So don't be nervous
5631500	5633500	if you see my sub numbers
5633500	5635500	going up.
5635500	5637500	It's already been planned.
5637500	5639500	Thank you for trusting
5639500	5641500	me little wifling.
5645500	5647500	Do you like 18 plus
5647500	5649500	art if there's a male
5649500	5651500	involved?
5651500	5653500	Mercy's Edge is not like fan art.
5653500	5655500	You
5655500	5657500	can make it a generic
5657500	5659500	white outline of a guy
5659500	5661500	like a protagonist, like self insert
5661500	5663500	protagonist
5663500	5665500	in order
5665500	5667500	excuse me stomach
5667500	5669500	in order to make it
5669500	5671500	a wifling
5671500	5673500	you just need to put a nicotine patch
5673500	5675500	on it.
5675500	5677500	Yeah.
5677500	5679500	Oh my stomach's really rumbling.
5679500	5681500	Maybe I should put the mic to my stomach.
5681500	5683500	You literally
5683500	5685500	yes
5685500	5687500	just put a nicotine patch
5687500	5689500	on a white outline
5689500	5691500	of a guy if you want like a guy
5691500	5693500	stand and think thing going on.
5693500	5695500	That's how you draw wifling.
5703500	5705500	Yeah.
5705500	5707500	A scrawny was wondering
5707500	5709500	if you try a new monster on her.
5709500	5711500	There's a new monster
5711500	5713500	on her. Sorry.
5713500	5715500	There's a new monster on her.
5715500	5717500	I didn't even know that.
5717500	5719500	I want to put my entire
5719500	5721500	tongue inside you.
5725500	5727500	The other one.
5727500	5729500	You are cute.
5729500	5731500	Thank you.
5731500	5733500	I'm glad you like it.
5733500	5735500	Oh it comes in next year.
5735500	5737500	Okay.
5737500	5739500	Shh.
5739500	5741500	Do you want to hear my tummy?
5741500	5743500	Okay. I'll let you hear my tummy.
5743500	5745500	I know.
5745500	5747500	I haven't eaten today.
5747500	5749500	So I don't know how loud
5749500	5751500	and maybe you may actually hear my heart.
5751500	5753500	I'll put you on my belly.
5759500	5761500	Do you hear anything?
5761500	5763500	Oh.
5763500	5765500	Do you hear it?
5781500	5783500	You're just above
5783500	5785500	my belly button.
5785500	5787500	Are you a little bit hungry?
5787500	5789500	Yeah.
5789500	5791500	I haven't had anything to eat.
5791500	5793500	Yeah.
5793500	5795500	I don't really eat before stream.
5797500	5799500	But yeah.
5799500	5801500	When I make
5801500	5803500	the
5803500	5805500	pregnant with you ASMR
5805500	5807500	it's going to have my actual tummy
5807500	5809500	signs in it.
5809500	5811500	Like you really are in the womb.
5811500	5813500	Go eat.
5813500	5815500	I don't want to eat after stream.
5815500	5817500	I have 20 minutes.
5817500	5819500	Thank you.
5819500	5821500	That's my tummy.
5823500	5825500	Do you hear stomach sounds
5825500	5827500	or my new favorite trigger?
5827500	5829500	Oh a few stomach sound ASMR.
5829500	5831500	I'll make that.
5831500	5833500	That's so easy to make.
5833500	5835500	Literally 15 minutes of silence.
5835500	5837500	I just stick a microphone to my stomach.
5837500	5839500	You can 100% have that.
5839500	5841500	Maybe I can name it something like
5841500	5843500	my girlfriend's stomach ASMR
5843500	5845500	but it won't stop f-ing rumbling
5845500	5847500	like to make it a meme title.
5851500	5853500	When you want that
5853500	5855500	pregnancy ASMR
5855500	5857500	you can't just say that.
5859500	5861500	Yeah I would love that.
5861500	5863500	Consider it on my to-do list then
5863500	5865500	because that's like super easy to make
5865500	5867500	ASMR wise.
5867500	5869500	Literally put the microphone
5869500	5871500	on my stomach
5871500	5873500	and be silent for 15 minutes
5873500	5875500	and then apply
5875500	5877500	a noise gate filter
5877500	5879500	and then that's it.
5879500	5881500	We're done.
5881500	5883500	Giant ASMR when?
5885500	5887500	I do have one.
5887500	5889500	Azura has one.
5889500	5891500	I'm going to make Emmy do one
5891500	5893500	because I want her book to go terribly wrong.
5895500	5897500	I'll make a plot where she's tired
5897500	5899500	being the smallest of the allure
5899500	5901500	and then ends up becoming a giant
5901500	5903500	for like 24 hours.
5905500	5907500	When would that be uploaded?
5909500	5911500	I want to say soon DM.
5911500	5913500	Maybe within the month?
5913500	5915500	I'll try my best.
5915500	5917500	Strongly goes crack and mood.
5917500	5919500	Laying on girlfriend's stomach while
5919500	5921500	she's waiting for her Door Dash order.
5921500	5923500	That's actually really good.
5923500	5925500	I might steal that. I'm not being funny.
5925500	5927500	I might actually just straight up steal your idea.
5927500	5929500	Thank you for that.
5931500	5933500	No way. I love you for that.
5933500	5935500	Strongly you're the best.
5935500	5937500	Wait for the giant ASMR
5937500	5939500	stomach.
5939500	5941500	Honestly,
5941500	5943500	I am always like
5943500	5945500	super happy to make you guys
5945500	5947500	happy and I always
5947500	5949500	want your ideas to be
5949500	5951500	our ideas communism.
5951500	5953500	That Door Dasher
5953500	5955500	me, literally.
5955500	5957500	She has
5957500	5959500	the spell to make everything
5959500	5961500	bigger but instead turns
5961500	5963500	herself into a giantess.
5963500	5965500	I know
5965500	5967500	so this is
5967500	5969500	a little fun fact
5969500	5971500	about me.
5971500	5973500	I actually really enjoy
5973500	5975500	giantism
5975500	5977500	which is why
5977500	5979500	Azura can
5979500	5981500	become a giant
5981500	5983500	but she can only be as tall
5983500	5985500	as a skyscraper. She can't be
5985500	5987500	indefinitely big
5987500	5989500	but she is a god at the end
5989500	5991500	of the day
5991500	5993500	but because she gave up some of her
5993500	5995500	divinity she has
5995500	5997500	a regular human height of 185 cm.
5999500	6001500	I wasn't kidding when I
6001500	6003500	said the girls were based after my
6003500	6005500	kinks. I don't care what anyone
6005500	6007500	says is true.
6009500	6011500	But yes, I
6011500	6013500	tiny shrunken chat.
6013500	6015500	I wanted to do swallowing
6015500	6017500	ASMR as well
6017500	6019500	where I get so hungry
6019500	6021500	little reefling and you look like calamari
6021500	6023500	and I swallow you
6023500	6025500	and you're in my tummy and I'm like
6025500	6027500	talking to you whilst you're getting
6027500	6029500	digested by me.
6031500	6033500	Yeah, I just like
6033500	6035500	these kind of things. I'm sorry.
6035500	6037500	No, please don't
6037500	6039500	eat us.
6041500	6043500	I just
6043500	6045500	like these things. I find them so
6045500	6047500	creative. I really do.
6049500	6051500	Well, I'm proud to be here
6051500	6053500	dinner.
6053500	6055500	I hope I'm
6055500	6057500	scared. Only
6057500	6059500	eat us in this other content.
6059500	6061500	Wait, I'm on the fence
6061500	6063500	about being eaten. We'll see
6063500	6065500	what you think after the audio comes out.
6065500	6067500	Maybe you'll like it. Maybe you won't.
6067500	6069500	As always,
6069500	6071500	don't subject
6071500	6073500	your tentacle
6073500	6075500	to something you know you don't like.
6077500	6079500	When is your
6079500	6081500	ink rating stream?
6081500	6083500	Probably next
6083500	6085500	week. It will be my membership
6085500	6087500	stream.
6087500	6089500	Where we rate everything
6089500	6091500	and I get to be as unhinged
6091500	6093500	as I desire.
6093500	6095500	I'm going to be speaking about all
6095500	6097500	the scenarios
6097500	6099500	I want to be doing on you.
6101500	6103500	I'm not holding back.
6111500	6113500	I mean being eaten by you is on the
6113500	6115500	table since debut. I assure you
6115500	6117500	I'm very nutritious.
6117500	6119500	Wow, my stomach
6119500	6121500	really is making my system.
6121500	6123500	Always giving a try to
6123500	6125500	audios you don't know if you like or not.
6125500	6127500	Yeah, some people
6127500	6129500	that didn't think they were going to enjoy the
6129500	6131500	Patreon.
6131500	6133500	Tell me, are you okay?
6133500	6135500	Some people
6135500	6137500	thought they didn't.
6137500	6139500	They weren't going to enjoy
6139500	6141500	my alternative
6141500	6143500	audio of a unique variation.
6143500	6145500	And they really enjoyed it.
6145500	6147500	Which I'm glad. It was
6147500	6149500	a fun challenge.
6149500	6151500	I enjoyed it very much.
6153500	6155500	There's literally no word that can come
6155500	6157500	out of your mouth. I don't love hearing
6157500	6159500	and inking for.
6159500	6161500	Go get food.
6161500	6163500	I'm redirecting
6163500	6165500	very shortly. I'll get food then.
6165500	6167500	I like being with you.
6167500	6169500	I don't want to get distracted.
6169500	6171500	Go get food.
6171500	6173500	If you're going to eat me,
6173500	6175500	at least give me a good time.
6177500	6179500	Maybe
6179500	6181500	I'll pretend that you're getting digested
6181500	6183500	but I'll just foam it you up again.
6183500	6185500	The Bully
6185500	6187500	Patreon.
6189500	6191500	What from any
6191500	6193500	love being with your dad?
6193500	6195500	Thank you.
6195500	6197500	Or do you mean the party one
6197500	6199500	where the P
6199500	6201500	picks on you at a party?
6203500	6205500	I think she be had some
6205500	6207500	problems today.
6209500	6211500	Why?
6211500	6213500	Problems with what?
6215500	6217500	I'm turned
6217500	6219500	for trying most
6219500	6221500	tags except for
6221500	6223500	text
6223500	6225500	because it just makes me sad. Oh, I'm sorry
6225500	6227500	to hear that.
6231500	6233500	Out of the audios,
6233500	6235500	their audios are so fun.
6235500	6237500	There's one ASMR that makes a bunch
6237500	6239500	of audios with listener
6239500	6241500	perishes.
6241500	6243500	Is that Macabre? I know exactly
6243500	6245500	who you're talking about, Macabre.
6245500	6247500	Oh no, I think they changed their name.
6247500	6249500	Sugar. I can't remember what their
6249500	6251500	new name is. Your voice gets
6251500	6253500	me distracted. Good.
6257500	6259500	It should.
6259500	6261500	Chubby weekend
6261500	6263500	tags are my favourite.
6263500	6265500	I have terrible news. Patreon
6265500	6267500	banner.
6267500	6269500	I can probably do something on
6269500	6271500	Twitter with that.
6271500	6273500	But Patreon banner.
6275500	6277500	Instead of one, you could just
6277500	6279500	put...
6279500	6281500	I can bill you.
6281500	6283500	Once you've had your time in the
6283500	6285500	tummy time, the demo
6285500	6287500	one was so good.
6287500	6289500	It was my first ever freaking
6289500	6291500	audio, and I was like so
6291500	6293500	nervous to do it.
6295500	6297500	Oh yes, do you like that?
6297500	6299500	Oh, I bet you do.
6299500	6301500	I enjoy it.
6301500	6303500	Come to bed with me.
6303500	6305500	It wasn't so nerve-wracking.
6305500	6307500	I was like, no one is going to
6307500	6309500	enjoy this, but I'm so glad you
6309500	6311500	enjoy it.
6311500	6313500	I don't know if I like the voice
6313500	6315500	or the attitude. I like to hear
6315500	6317500	what makes it...
6319500	6321500	I thought there's a cat here
6321500	6323500	in my mouth.
6325500	6327500	There's a freaking cat here.
6327500	6329500	Kimly.
6329500	6331500	Kimly, your freaking cat here went
6331500	6333500	in my mouth.
6333500	6335500	All your Patreon content is good.
6335500	6337500	Thank you.
6337500	6339500	I can't remember what the next
6339500	6341500	plot being uploaded is.
6341500	6343500	Yeah, Patreon
6343500	6345500	literally said
6345500	6347500	feedurism ban. Well, no.
6347500	6349500	MasterCard just said it's ban
6349500	6351500	because it's like dangerous or whatever.
6351500	6353500	That cat here
6353500	6355500	literally me.
6355500	6357500	You're in my mouth.
6357500	6359500	Do you hypnotize yourself? No, I can.
6359500	6361500	But
6361500	6363500	lore-wise,
6363500	6365500	mirrors are my
6365500	6367500	biggest weakness.
6367500	6369500	And when I do my tonathon,
6369500	6371500	you guys are going to be sick of those
6371500	6373500	laws. I freaking
6373500	6375500	love ton laws so much.
6375500	6377500	I don't care what anyone says.
6377500	6379500	It's so good.
6379500	6381500	Like, please
6381500	6383500	parade me around like a pup.
6385500	6387500	Credit card companies need to
6387500	6389500	stop. Yes,
6389500	6391500	it's crazy.
6391500	6393500	I mean, they literally run the world
6393500	6395500	whilst they're banning
6395500	6397500	all this stuff and they're all jumping on
6397500	6399500	Epstein Island. Like, you literally
6399500	6401500	can't make this stuff up.
6401500	6403500	They ban feedurism,
6403500	6405500	but they're all chilling on Epstein Island.
6405500	6407500	Prove.
6407500	6409500	Get a fucking grip. Honestly, this is when
6409500	6411500	I don't look in the rabbit hole. You'll go too deep.
6411500	6413500	Well, time to get a mirror.
6413500	6415500	Are you afraid of mirrors?
6415500	6417500	It's because
6417500	6419500	if I look into a mirror
6419500	6421500	like this, I can hypnotize
6421500	6423500	myself because I fall
6423500	6425500	for the spiral.
6425500	6427500	Okay, so I can't look
6427500	6429500	at mirrors while I'm trying to hypnotize
6429500	6431500	you or else I'm in
6431500	6433500	trouble.
6433500	6435500	Don't lose as long as it's
6435500	6437500	huge.
6437500	6439500	Morning, good morning.
6439500	6441500	I want
6441500	6443500	Astronic conspiracy theory stream.
6443500	6445500	You asked, I will deliver.
6445500	6447500	Oh my god.
6447500	6449500	Like, I know I keep mentioning needy streamer
6449500	6451500	overload. I was so surprised
6451500	6453500	that they had that kind
6453500	6455500	of thing because I was like, wait a minute.
6455500	6457500	I'm interested
6457500	6459500	in this stuff, but
6459500	6461500	I'm aware it may filter a lot of people.
6461500	6463500	But
6463500	6465500	then again,
6465500	6467500	more intimate streams.
6469500	6471500	I just made refling.
6471500	6473500	I just made
6475500	6477500	I'm just glad
6477500	6479500	everyone is based. Yeah.
6479500	6481500	We're probably like, we don't really judge
6481500	6483500	anyone here. Just have a good time.
6483500	6485500	All that jazz.
6487500	6489500	Astronic conspiracy
6489500	6491500	theory stream. Oh,
6491500	6493500	that's going to take me hours to prepare
6493500	6495500	my presentation.
6495500	6497500	I'm going to come with a breath.
6497500	6499500	I'm going to come with a receipt.
6499500	6501500	I'm going to change your perspective on
6501500	6503500	everything.
6503500	6505500	They can't handle listening to the
6505500	6507500	truth. I'm going to put a tin foil
6507500	6509500	hat on myself and I will
6509500	6511500	offer you all to wear a tin foil hat
6511500	6513500	on stream too.
6517500	6519500	Feeler is going for cultural victory.
6519500	6521500	Exactly.
6521500	6523500	Based. Oh, should you base it on?
6523500	6525500	The stream is a perfect test for
6525500	6527500	my new headphones. Oh, yeah.
6527500	6529500	Can you hear me in this ear?
6529500	6531500	What if I go into this ear?
6531500	6533500	Does it sound like I am going
6533500	6535500	ear to ear? It's kind of amazing
6535500	6537500	technology, isn't it?
6537500	6539500	Please. I'll let you gaslight me.
6539500	6541500	Oh, please let me main break you.
6541500	6543500	Please. Please for me.
6543500	6545500	I'll be a good little girl.
6547500	6549500	If you let me main break you.
6553500	6555500	I had to dream the other night.
6555500	6557500	I had to dream I had you in a
6557500	6559500	standing position but I was lifting you.
6559500	6561500	Your little legs were swaying
6561500	6563500	as I was moving.
6563500	6565500	A lot of painting
6565500	6567500	and roughness of fall
6567500	6569500	briefly. Oh my god.
6573500	6575500	Great on head.
6575500	6577500	Please. Song sure good girl.
6577500	6579500	That's right. I'm a good girl.
6583500	6585500	Keep playing with me. Be careful.
6585500	6587500	Okay. Yeah. I'm a good friend.
6587500	6589500	Please.
6589500	6591500	Wow.
6591500	6593500	Wow.
6593500	6595500	Wow.
6595500	6597500	Did our legs sway to improve?
6597500	6599500	Did I am in love?
6601500	6603500	An audio where you try and hypnotize
6603500	6605500	Shibi but end up seeing a mirror
6605500	6607500	and hypnotizing yourself and she
6607500	6609500	takes advantage of the situation
6609500	6611500	would be quite interesting.
6613500	6615500	Is that a donathon public
6615500	6617500	report?
6617500	6619500	I think it is.
6621500	6623500	Wait for a Zora to cook.
6623500	6625500	Okay.
6625500	6627500	I will be working one on one with a Zora
6627500	6629500	to help her donathon wards
6629500	6631500	and if it goes well
6631500	6633500	I think a Zora can move out.
6633500	6635500	And I'm so excited for her.
6639500	6641500	Anyway now that you are so close I must say
6641500	6643500	I like a lot of little green
6643500	6645500	parts in my hair. Yeah.
6645500	6647500	I have a few strands of green
6647500	6649500	out but that's just because
6649500	6651500	I can't keep it all away.
6651500	6653500	I have such big hair.
6653500	6655500	Could you please put the head
6655500	6657500	and the eyes on? Sure.
6657500	6659500	But it won't be.
6667500	6669500	Hi Refle.
6669500	6671500	It's me again.
6671500	6673500	Just talking
6673500	6675500	to your subconscious.
6677500	6679500	Don't worry.
6679500	6681500	I won't do anything.
6681500	6683500	Not this day.
6685500	6687500	But this is just a remainder.
6689500	6691500	I own you.
6691500	6693500	All of you.
6695500	6697500	Your thoughts.
6697500	6699500	Your mind.
6701500	6703500	Just a remainder.
6711500	6713500	My hair.
6713500	6715500	Did I turn off the reverb?
6715500	6717500	Is the reverb off?
6719500	6721500	Did I turn it off?
6721500	6723500	Or did I not hit the button?
6725500	6727500	Yes it's off.
6727500	6729500	Okay thank you.
6729500	6731500	Indeed you do on me.
6731500	6733500	Sounds off.
6733500	6735500	Okay get the reverb wasn't on.
6735500	6737500	Oh it never came on.
6737500	6739500	It was supposed to come on.
6739500	6741500	I guess I never hit the button hard enough.
6741500	6743500	Reverb.
6743500	6745500	Never turned on.
6747500	6749500	This is a remainder.
6749500	6751500	Wait is it broken?
6751500	6753500	Oh I think it might be broken.
6753500	6755500	Oops I broke it.
6755500	6757500	Oops.
6757500	6759500	It seems like I dropped my mirror face up.
6759500	6761500	I hope you don't like that.
6761500	6763500	Yes you won't be.
6763500	6765500	It was never on.
6765500	6767500	Do it again.
6767500	6769500	It's broken. I don't know why it's not working.
6773500	6775500	When you mentioned about A.C.
6775500	6777500	using our boots to step on us
6777500	6779500	and nearly triggered something in me.
6779500	6781500	Also you trying to hit me
6781500	6783500	was on a ship with the ships.
6783500	6785500	The ships can't see or get into your bed
6785500	6787500	causing people to get hypnotized by your reflection.
6787500	6789500	That's so good.
6791500	6793500	Wait what almost triggered you?
6793500	6795500	A.C. sound?
6795500	6797500	You almost got triggered?
6799500	6801500	Are you really that badly minded?
6803500	6805500	That something so sweet
6805500	6807500	and innocent
6807500	6809500	and feral like me
6809500	6811500	could hurt you?
6811500	6813500	Could hurt you?
6813500	6815500	A.C. sound?
6815500	6817500	And you'd like it.
6817500	6819500	You're so dirty.
6819500	6821500	I can't.
6821500	6823500	I'm sorry A.C.
6823500	6825500	I'm so sorry A.C.
6827500	6829500	My role playing is my genie.
6829500	6831500	Is that a thing that's weird?
6831500	6833500	I don't know if I'm crossing a boundary.
6833500	6835500	I should probably ask them.
6841500	6843500	They're not the oos in chat over me.
6847500	6849500	Surprise this is my actual voice.
6853500	6855500	You're going to A.C.'s mimic.
6855500	6857500	If my voice wasn't broken
6857500	6859500	I wonder if I could smoothly do A.C.'s voice.
6863500	6865500	Hi A.C.'s fans.
6865500	6867500	Hi A.C.'s fans.
6867500	6869500	I missed you.
6870500	6873500	We are playing Tomb Raider today.
6873500	6875500	I can hardly do it
6875500	6877500	without causing the crack in my voice.
6877500	6879500	That's very hard because she's higher pitched than me.
6881500	6883500	We'll get them next time.
6885500	6887500	That could be a fun idea.
6887500	6889500	Everyone has to impersonate.
6889500	6891500	Well I begs A.C. because she's the only one I can impersonate.
6893500	6895500	With mailed success.
6895500	6897500	I wonder if it's because she's European
6897500	6899500	that I can mimic.
6899500	6901500	That seems silly but at the same time
6901500	6903500	she is the only voice.
6903500	6905500	Your voice is already our favourite.
6907500	6909500	We're very Sean Connery when it's deep.
6911500	6913500	I can make my accent even stronger
6915500	6917500	but I don't talk on stream like this
6917500	6919500	because hardly anyone can understand
6919500	6921500	what the heck I'm saying.
6921500	6923500	Do you mean
6927500	6929500	Sorry do you mean
6929500	6931500	just having a big white square over the male's face
6931500	6933500	with a nicotine patch on it?
6933500	6935500	Maybe I understand.
6935500	6937500	Or I'm just stupid.
6937500	6939500	Sorry for that idea.
6939500	6941500	I had a character with neat eyes and a mouse.
6945500	6947500	If you go on my alternative twitter
6947500	6949500	that are
6949500	6951500	oh why am I
