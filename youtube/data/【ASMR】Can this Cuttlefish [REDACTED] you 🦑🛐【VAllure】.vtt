00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Hey, I was over for you before we even got started.

00:16.000 --> 00:28.000
Hello, are you there?

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
Can you hear this little call of it?

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello, my mouth is wiggling because I didn't put my lid on.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm cooking, I'm cooking.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
So professional, so professional.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
My cats are currently play-fighting.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
So if you hear my cats play-fighting, it's going to be terrible.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
I made the mistake of giving my cats what's called a licky lick.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Wait, I spelled permanent wrong.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm not dead.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
So if you're bumping about, my cats are going to absolutely wail.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Hi.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
Now today is a very short stream.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
But I should really sound like this for you.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Good morning.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Good evening.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
And good afternoon.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I have lots of fun things to try.

01:56.000 --> 02:06.000
I need to make myself louder or lower the background sound.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
Now I just want to say I'm not doing any permanent effects.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
So don't worry, you're in good condition.

02:20.000 --> 02:31.000
I will look after you as I hear my cat bumping against my door.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Hi.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Now I spelled permanent but it remained in it.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Now you all know.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
Make it permanent.

02:49.000 --> 02:59.000
Have to miss this stream, it's okay.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
We're going nice and slow.

03:06.000 --> 03:17.000
I don't normally use these eyes but I can't help it.

03:17.000 --> 03:26.000
It was always permanent.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
I can now hear my cat run behind my couch.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
Oh, there she goes.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, and she's...

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
Okay, I think she's just jumped on the cardboard box now.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
So take your time to relax.

03:57.000 --> 04:11.000
I think she's beaten up V-core right now.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Of course, she's been so good.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
I think she's beaten up V-core right now.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
But it's okay.

04:28.000 --> 04:40.000
So slowly, you can feel yourself starting to drift.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
And that's okay.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Like that feeling, come over here.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
No reflex, don't let go.

04:54.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh no, is this ear broken?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Is this ear broken? Is this ear broken? Hello?

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Oh my gosh, wait, why is one ear stronger than the other?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Both ears work.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Oh, okay, I just said right into your ear that.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Oopsies, sorry, I just whispered right into your ear.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
The ear works, but as less equal, why would that be?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
If anything, can't go.

05:30.000 --> 05:38.000
I don't know why, because my focus rate isn't equal.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Such a professional stream there.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
No, I should say correct.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
It's okay if it's weaker.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
I like them weak.

05:55.000 --> 06:06.000
The bass part, hello.

06:06.000 --> 06:16.000
Let this cobalt fish lure you to the depths.

06:16.000 --> 06:27.000
For no particular reason at all.

06:27.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh, sorry, I did it twice, I had to make twice.

06:36.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm just gonna brush over your ears to give you the feeling of a false security,

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
as I'm sure I'm not planning anything else at all.

06:57.000 --> 07:08.000
Not one single thing.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
We get to go down into the depths together.

07:14.000 --> 07:29.000
Just me, and you, and my voice, and you listening in.

07:29.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah, gently, brushing over your ears.

07:40.000 --> 07:49.000
And some cats, okay, maybe the caster.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
Wow.

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
Gentle, gentle movements.

08:04.000 --> 08:13.000
I have some good news for my reflinks.

08:13.000 --> 08:22.000
My YouTube channel has been submitted for monetizing.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh, the heat just came on.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
I need to go turn the heat off, I'm so sorry.

08:31.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm so professional, let's go.

09:00.000 --> 09:11.000
Come on, it was me, I won't get all lost, being professional, it's me.

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
When can I start being myself, or do I need to keep being professional?

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
The cat turned the heat on, because it wants attention.

09:24.000 --> 09:34.000
Okay, give me five more minutes and I'll be serious, okay?

09:34.000 --> 09:50.000
The noise is encapsulating you.

09:50.000 --> 10:04.000
And you feel behind a sense of belonging.

10:04.000 --> 10:17.000
You could even think to yourself, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

10:17.000 --> 10:38.000
If I gave up control, control to one particular girl, and it wouldn't be so bad.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
What's the worst that could happen from this little gullfish?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Is there a cat in my room?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
No.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Okay, I literally thought Gimli sneaked in there.

10:53.000 --> 11:07.000
As I'm saying control yet, surely this gullfish means no harm.

11:07.000 --> 11:25.000
And even if it was for 24 hours, one day, one day, how much harm could you really be

11:25.000 --> 11:39.000
under, or could be done in 24 little hours?

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
No more harm at all.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
So slowly your mind wanders.

11:48.000 --> 11:57.000
What would this gullfish ask me to do?

11:57.000 --> 12:05.000
Only a few things, my dear refling.

12:05.000 --> 12:14.000
But some things can't be said, only guessed.

12:14.000 --> 12:30.000
You have to go into deeper parts of your mind to know and realize what this gullfish wants.

12:30.000 --> 12:53.000
And maybe my dear refling, you realize I want complete and total control of you.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
Would that be so bad?

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
No.

13:03.000 --> 13:22.000
So maybe that 24 hours becomes 48, and then 48 becomes 72.

13:22.000 --> 13:34.000
And before you know it, this gullfish has had a week of you.

13:34.000 --> 14:02.000
Then two weeks, a month, or maybe just maybe this gullfish made breaks you.

14:02.000 --> 14:12.000
That's just my things that I want.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
But you have to earn the things you want.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
So I need to bathe, don't I?

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
I need to do the right things.

14:28.000 --> 14:36.000
So you're encapsulated by me, yeah?

14:36.000 --> 14:46.000
So how about just for now, I'll be a good girl for you.

14:46.000 --> 14:57.000
And maybe, just maybe, you'll be a very good boy for me.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
Does that sound like a plan, my dear refling?

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:18.000
Let's see how much we can bathe together.

15:18.000 --> 15:33.000
Let's be on our best behavior then.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
I'll tell you a way that I can be good for you.

15:40.000 --> 15:52.000
I'll allow you, refling, to type sentences you want me to say in chat right now.

15:52.000 --> 16:06.000
And I just might go from ear to ear and gain more favor from you as I say what you want to hear.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Does that sound like a plan?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Because I'd love to do that for you.

16:14.000 --> 16:21.000
Gain your favor, huh?

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
Zepai means couple fish in Italian.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Hi, honey.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
All hail the ref.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
You're such a playful little thing, aren't ya?

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
That's why we have such fun together, isn't it, refling?

16:51.000 --> 16:59.000
I love you, refling.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm proud of you.

17:03.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm proud of us.

17:11.000 --> 17:21.000
And I'm totally not hypnotizing you right now.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
Oh, you're not gonna be a loser, are you, refling?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
You're not gonna lose to me.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Don't tell me this is enough to put you under my spell.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
You have to make me work for it, refling.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
You do less work really, really hard.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Here we go.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
You can look in my eyes.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
Just done the spiral.

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
Dear...

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Do you like looking into my eyes?

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
I think they're rather tantalizing, don't ya?

18:32.000 --> 18:39.000
I can make my eyes open wide like this.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Staring right at you.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I see you.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
And you see me.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
And you see everything I'm doing to you.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Right at this very second.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
It's okay.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
You can blink.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
But don't look away for too long.

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
Remember, we have to behave for one another.

19:18.000 --> 19:29.000
Do you like that?

19:29.000 --> 19:39.000
I'll just tap on your ears gently, gently, gently, gently.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
You're more welcome.

19:43.000 --> 19:56.000
You're more than welcome to blink and sink.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
I quite like that phrase.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Blink and sink.

20:03.000 --> 20:15.000
It's okay if your body starts to feel a bit weaker.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
And if your mind starts to wander.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
That's okay.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
You may even say little refling.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
That's by design.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
I don't know.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
There's just something about you being a bit tired around me.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
Maybe you don't want to fade back.

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
Not like you could by the time I'm done with you.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
My little refling.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
Why don't you come a little bit closer?

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
I promise I won't pay.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
No.

21:17.000 --> 21:26.000
In fact, you may blink what you faint.

21:27.000 --> 21:42.000
As you go deeper and deeper with me.

21:42.000 --> 21:51.000
Deeper and deeper, your thoughts are turning to confusion.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
What did you say?

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
With only my voice remaining in your head.

22:01.000 --> 22:13.000
You don't have to focus on a single thing other than what this alluring cuttlefish is seeing.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
There, there.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
Just look at me and forget.

22:25.000 --> 22:37.000
All you need to know, refling, is that you're safe and you're in good hands with me.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
And by the time I'm finished with you,

22:43.000 --> 22:50.000
you'll already want to be going under again.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
But little refling.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
I'll give you a tingle break, okay?

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
I'll say more phrases shortly.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
But have a little break, break, break, break.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
We need to take things slow.

23:13.000 --> 23:26.000
Think of it as an introduction to your induction.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
But please don't worry.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
There will be no permanent effects in this dream.

23:38.000 --> 23:46.000
So you are welcome to go as deep as you like with me.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah.

23:49.000 --> 24:00.000
Although I do admit this good girl likes it when you go deep.

24:00.000 --> 24:07.000
Yeah.

24:07.000 --> 24:14.000
Thank you for the deep little refling.

24:14.000 --> 24:22.000
You like when I do ASMR streams on you, huh?

24:22.000 --> 24:35.000
Oh, I had plenty of time to think of how I could truly mean to break you.

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
This is one of many, okay?

24:42.000 --> 24:51.000
So to those who may be resistant, that's okay.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Because I'm coming for you.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
Do you understand?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I will get you.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
That is my goal.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
And have I failed any of my goals so far?

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
No little refling.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
So heed my warning.

25:20.000 --> 25:36.000
I am coming.

25:36.000 --> 25:43.000
Yeah.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Relax.

25:47.000 --> 25:55.000
If you think my words are waking you up,

25:55.000 --> 26:05.000
they should be slowly bringing you down.

26:05.000 --> 26:12.000
Down, down, down, okay?

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
That's why we need a little timer.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
Where we just listen in.

26:21.000 --> 26:30.000
And whatever our brain and body decides will do.

26:30.000 --> 26:38.000
But that doesn't mean this cuttlefish can suggest a few things to you.

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
Yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:54.000
Hey.

26:54.000 --> 27:03.000
Just let whatever happens happen.

27:03.000 --> 27:12.000
I won't be bidding you purposefully in a trance, okay?

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
But if you just happen to be so well-drained,

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
I welcome it entirely.

27:24.000 --> 27:34.000
I welcome my voice and encapsulating your mind.

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
I welcome your full attention.

27:41.000 --> 27:54.000
So be good, little refling, and don't keep me waiting.

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
You might feel it starting from your head

28:07.000 --> 28:15.000
and slowly a sensation radiates downwards

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
down to your neck, then your shoulders.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
And that sensation splits off.

28:27.000 --> 28:34.000
It splits going down your arms and chest at the same time.

28:34.000 --> 28:46.000
Slowly, slowly, slowly radiating its way through your body.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
Turn your stomach.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
Down, down, down.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
And past your hips.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
It's already gone through your fingertips at this point.

29:08.000 --> 29:17.000
And down your legs, your thighs, your calves, your feet.

29:17.000 --> 29:26.000
Until that sensation is all over.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
There's nothing you can do about it, but that's okay.

29:31.000 --> 29:37.000
Because the sensation is pleasant.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
It's warm.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
It feels comforting.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
It's hard for you to describe, but that's okay.

29:50.000 --> 29:57.000
I will do the talking for the both of us.

29:57.000 --> 30:10.000
That sensation is you possibly entering a trance, and that's okay.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
It's nice when I'm in control.

30:14.000 --> 30:24.000
It's nice when you let me in control.

30:28.000 --> 30:34.000
Enjoy the feeling, okay?

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
Enjoy the sensation.

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
We're both doing it together, aren't we?

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Yeah.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
Yeah.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
Good.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
For you.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
Are your limbs feeling heavy?

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
It's okay, little reef like, that's just a side effect.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
But over time, you'll make enjoy it.

31:12.000 --> 31:20.000
Because when your limbs feel heavy, that's when you know, that's when you know this kind of fish.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
As in control.

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
And I'll keep you safe when you're with me, okay?

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
Okay, little reef like.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
For you.

31:45.000 --> 31:52.000
For you, little reef like.

31:52.000 --> 31:58.000
This is all by your choice.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
Although you might be too deep, should I bring you back up?

32:05.000 --> 32:14.000
Or are you strong enough to give me some phrases you want to hear?

32:14.000 --> 32:21.000
Do you think you could do that for me, little reef like?

32:21.000 --> 32:37.000
You tell me what you want to hear, and this kind of fish will be, will both be good for each other.

32:37.000 --> 32:46.000
Because I'm ready to obey you.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
You're doing such a good job.

32:51.000 --> 32:59.000
I'm so proud of how far you've come, little reef like.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
Back and forth.

33:04.000 --> 33:12.000
Ear to ear.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah.

33:16.000 --> 33:29.000
You did good today.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
And I can see how hard you're working.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
Well done, little reef like.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Well done.

33:41.000 --> 33:48.000
You're a good boy, and I'm a good girl.

33:48.000 --> 33:56.000
Together we'll have lots of fun.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
Just surrender and let me take control.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.000
My little reef like.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
You always do.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
Don't ya?

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
And I'm sure you'll make it through.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
It's hard right now, but you'll make it through.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
You always do.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
Don't ya?

34:31.000 --> 34:39.000
And I'll be there on the other side, cheering you on.

34:39.000 --> 34:54.000
Oh, my little reef like, would you kindly be a good little boy for mommy?

34:54.000 --> 35:01.000
Oh, you're so heavy and so deep.

35:01.000 --> 35:08.000
And so happy to give yourself to me.

35:09.000 --> 35:15.000
Resistance is futile at this point.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Just give in, give up.

35:19.000 --> 35:27.000
My strength is unrelenting, my stamina unending.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
One way or another, you are main.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
Core.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Okay.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
Let's relax, relax, relax, relax.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
There we go.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
I'll bring you back up a little.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
I don't want you guys to get so deep now.

36:00.000 --> 36:09.000
This was supposed to be a very gentle and secret induction.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
I'll do some more little tingles.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Oh, my reeflings.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
I don't know if I should bring you back up,

36:25.000 --> 36:33.000
or if I should leave you in the trance if you're in one then.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
You want to go a little deeper?

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
I need to be gentle with you, though.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Don't you see?

36:46.000 --> 36:57.000
I've had so much time to think of how hard I was going to...

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
What's the word, eh?

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
How hard I was going to go on you.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
And I need to be able to not break you.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
I don't want to break you, no more.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
I want to mate, break you.

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
But that takes time.

37:25.000 --> 37:31.000
We just need to spend a little more time together.

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
My stomach is making noises, I root.

37:37.000 --> 37:44.000
If you bring us back up, it makes dropping back down even better.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
Please, oh.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
For you guys.

37:54.000 --> 38:06.000
Yeah, just relax and let loose all of this burden.

38:06.000 --> 38:14.000
Because when you're under, I'll be supporting you.

38:14.000 --> 38:24.000
And I'll caress all over you, look after you.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
I can only say the rest of it.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
Over reeflings.

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
Okay, I'm going to slowly bring you back again.

38:43.000 --> 38:50.000
And just take your time, slowly.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
You can feel yourself come up.

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
That heavy feeling that's all over your body

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
is lifting slowly.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
Reversing from the path it once took.

39:11.000 --> 39:18.000
From your feet to your calves and thighs.

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
Your thoughts are becoming their own again.

39:24.000 --> 39:33.000
That sensation coming back up, up, up your body.

39:33.000 --> 39:42.000
Past your hips, your stomach, your chest.

39:42.000 --> 39:54.000
Your fingertips, your hands to your elbows, your shoulders slowly up, up, up.

39:54.000 --> 40:06.000
Until that sensation goes back to your collar, your neck, your head.

40:06.000 --> 40:14.000
Until you're here again, little reefling.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
Welcome back to the land of the living.

40:19.000 --> 40:26.000
Hi, reefling. Did you have fun?

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Yeah, good morning.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
Good morning, little reefling.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
That's my tracking every such a silly day. Hold on.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
You need to calibrate.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
Wow, calibration complete.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Johnny returns.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
The meme lord herself.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
My cup of tea got cold.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
I got really into that. I'm sorry, I really got into that.

40:55.000 --> 41:01.000
But my cup of tea is cold, so I can't have my cup of tea.

41:01.000 --> 41:10.000
Good morning, little reefling, or afternoon, or evening, or good time zone.

41:10.000 --> 41:19.000
Oh, let me, uh, this is more me, I think. Yeah, yeah, this is more me.

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
Microwave the tea, reefling, don't be so silly.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
Special thank you again to Anonymous for the tip.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
Anonymous said, holy moly, this ace of art stream is so good.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Thank you very much. Yeah, that was my true heart in.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
But now you've got the meme lord me.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Get wrecked.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
It's very unlikely I will pull that off again in this stream,

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
because I am fricking rubbish at being fricking, uh, what's the word?

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
Serious. Yeah, I should probably, uh, maybe we just, uh, camera thing.

41:56.000 --> 42:02.000
Hi, it's me. I'll leave the background, it's quite soothing, but it's me again. Hi.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
I reefling.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
That cramp lunch box, that's right, get knocked on. Yeah.

42:11.000 --> 42:18.000
Are you enjoying Aces? Oh, Anonymous. I can't say Brian.

42:18.000 --> 42:26.000
Ah, thank you for the tip, Anonymous. Anonymous is trying to cute. Yeah, we cute up in her.

42:26.000 --> 42:33.000
Gremlin's back, oh baby, so don't be expecting any serious to come out of my mouth for the rest of this stream.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
Like, if you're here, if you're here for the, that section we just did, sorry.

42:38.000 --> 42:45.000
The meme-er, the meme-er is back, okay? My voice is right from RuneScape yesterday.

42:45.000 --> 42:53.000
But I do plan on doing weekly ASMR streams, which is why I do say please like and subscribe for more.

42:53.000 --> 43:02.000
Uh, the fantastic news, my little reeflings, the fantastic news is my channel is being submitted for monetization,

43:02.000 --> 43:10.000
which means I can finally start uploading my ASMR videos for my 1000, so thank you.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
I'm already on 4000 subscribers, which is amazing, which means I owe you, yes you, listening in.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
That's right, this streamer owes you content.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
So I have four ASMR videos getting ready.

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
So we've submitted my channel to YouTube, and I'm sure they're gonna really like that.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
James Cameron's avatar stream, yeah.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
When I absolutely raged.

43:38.000 --> 43:44.000
But yeah, the meme-er is back, don't be expecting anything, but how good does this ASMR sound?

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
So how good does this?

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Oh, I should maybe take off the hypno background.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
Now you get to hear my stomach even more.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Thank you for the tip.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
Oh, Irfan Piscotti, thank you for the tips.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Thank you, Momay, very nice and relaxing.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I've got you, like, down there.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
Though returning to Kremlin mode is good too, yeah.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
That's more like me.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Best of luck on monetization.

44:10.000 --> 44:20.000
Thank you for the tip, and yes, um, for that kind of thing, I'm most likely gonna be doing free content on Twitter.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
Milk Cadmus, thank you for the tip.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
That was amazing.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
Please, for the love of all, that is strongly keeping our cut by all of this posted.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
I never did anything wrong in this stream.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
I have done everything correct.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
But this, this is a sensory toy, and it's my favorite ASMR trigger right now.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Listen to it.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Isn't that amazing?

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
Thank you so much for that tip, Milk Cadmus.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
But yeah, I didn't do anything wrong this stream.

45:00.000 --> 45:07.000
But if you didn't know, AC Snowballs is live right now doing a DJ session.

45:07.000 --> 45:14.000
So if you're needing this to be a bit more, if you're needing a bit more hype for your stream,

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
definitely check her out.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
M-A, Shabby, and Zara.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I believe we're all going live as well.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
This is the shortest stream for me.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
We will be redirecting into Shabby Cottonbomb.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
Sounds like a piece of rubber stuck to the surface.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
Hey, yeah, I was a good girl this stream.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
I did everything correct, yeah.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Sounds like one of those squeeze stress toys.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
I just don't want to risk it, and also you only want to say the name right.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I don't even know why I said it.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
I forgot.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Wait, you're going already?

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
No.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
I'm gonna do, Jen, I'm gonna do Kremlin ASMR.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I'm gonna do ASMR like me.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
Look, I even have this to put on your ears.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Are you ready?

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Look, look, look, look, look.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I'm gonna put this on your ears.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Ready?

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Look.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
You're almost home.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
You can do ASMR.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
This is nice.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
I'm rubbing them all against your ears.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
I put winter earmuffs on your ears.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Wow, dinner didn't stream with absolutely no ears.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
What do you mean by cats fighting at the start of the stream?

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
I'm not gonna leave a like, and then don't leave my son.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Yeah, you're so fluffy.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
You're so fluffy.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
You're so fluffy.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
First time I was into ASMR, I'm gonna come back for more.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Glad I could take it.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
It's nice to have a short stream to recover from your infinite stamina.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
My voice is really broken, but because I'm whispering, you can't tell it's broken.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
Some people like chugging ASMR.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I have lots of chugging.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Water.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Okay.

47:57.000 --> 48:03.000
Have I been a good girl for you?

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Wait, wait, wait.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Yeah, I forgot my tea.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
I've got a cold cup of tea over here.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
But it was a lot of fun doing that ASMR.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
And really, sorry, my throat is making throat noises.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
Yeah, but this is just kind of a little bit of a challenge.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I'm gonna do ASMR.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Yeah.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
Yeah, but this is just gonna be an easier stream.

48:58.000 --> 49:04.000
Because I don't want to break my voice.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
This is the closest I've ever been to being fully transitive.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
I'm usually so focused on trying to go under.

49:13.000 --> 49:18.000
See, but I think because I didn't plan any of what I was seeing,

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
because I was like natural, it made it easier to enjoy.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
You know?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
That's probably why.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Be a good girl and swallow what you...

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Reflings, we're trying to leave this up.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
Will you ever do a full hypno video?

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Yeah, definitely.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I need to make sure I make it safe though.

49:46.000 --> 49:52.000
I need to educate myself a bit more, because I need it all to be safe.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
Which is why I'm not doing any permanent effects on this stream.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
Because I may or may not have an interest in permanent effects,

50:01.000 --> 50:08.000
but I already have an audio recorded that undoes any effects that I may do on you.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
But I really like the permanent effects stuff.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
I'm sorry, it's just what I'm interested in.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
And I may want to break you a little bit, but just a little bit.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
It's not going to be bad or anything.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
Like it's just going to be a wee bit of breaking, okay?

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Just a wee bit.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Not a big bit.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
So yeah, I need to make sure I do it 100% safe.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
And it's filbert.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Break me moment.

50:34.000 --> 50:40.000
To keep up the buns, I just have to say, you and your eyes wear a strong ashing.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Thank you.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I love it.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
If you need to present, break, take or leave it.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
And before we commit more times.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Hey, yeah.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Effects like what?

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
Oh, so there's like different kinds of like hypno.

50:58.000 --> 51:06.000
And so you can purposely make like trainer ones where like I train you.

51:06.000 --> 51:12.000
Like I literally path off your subconscious to react to me or to do something.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Or react in a certain way.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
And I need to make sure it's super safe.

51:19.000 --> 51:27.000
And I need if I do an audio that basically states that like I don't have an effect on you anymore.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
It tells your subconscious to throw everything that you learned out the window.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
And then it's all safe.

51:35.000 --> 51:41.000
Welcome to Stronikato's YouTube where safety number one priority.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Thoughts already doomed.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Stroni and her permanent effect will be like you will only do your thing to me.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Basically, kind of.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
It's the plan.

51:53.000 --> 51:58.000
I want to do like sessions that last two hours long.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
I can't wait.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
I know my voice is going to be fried, but yeah.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
Will there be lullabies for the replaying?

52:11.000 --> 52:18.000
My voice is broken, but I know you are my sunshine.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
You are my sunshine.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
My only sunshine.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
You make me happy.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
When skies are gray.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
You'll never know dear.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I'm a giant of you.

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
So please don't take my replaying away.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
Lullabies!

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
I don't know many other lullabies.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
Freerishaka, Freerishaka.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
Dormithu, Dormithu.

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
Would be cool if you had a button that made the camera zoom in on your eyes.

52:59.000 --> 53:05.000
Or, well, next stream I'll have a tracker so it follows my head around.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
So you can't escape my eyes.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
But I wanted to go very easy.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
Very easy on the first one.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Please don't take my sunshine away.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
Dormithu, Dormithu.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
There is that cradle one.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
The cradle you will fall.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
Rock by baby on the tree top.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
I don't know the rest.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
What were your inspirations for being?

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
I have no theme to career.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
I've always, always loved it.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I've always loved it.

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
But I have always known how deep the rabbit hole goes.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
And I've touched on surface level.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
But I was like, I want to go, I want to go rabbit hole.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Sorry, the wire is spilling on the desk.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
I, I want to go all in, baby, all in.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
So, well, the table at the top will be fixed.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
I can fix it now if you tell me how to spell the word.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
What's the word?

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Be'er me, was it?

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Ah, bear me.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
Be'er me, I knit it.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Be'er me, I knit it.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Okay, then you'll just let that sit.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Okay, you even have to bring Cremlund.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Cremlund, know.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Cremlund.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Wow, look at that.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Super professional.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Sorry.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
We're going down the after-roll.

54:40.000 --> 54:48.000
After all, yeah, there's like so much to it that I just knew I couldn't do it until, until it would stay.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
And now it's time.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
Well, tippy tippy, I'm crimsonized, yeah.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Don't be expecting anything serious from me.

55:02.000 --> 55:07.000
Oh, did you, like, make my head load, obnoxiously load my keyboardist?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Oh, yeah, it's so good.

55:11.000 --> 55:18.000
So I, for triggers, I like double finger-clicking.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I like finger-clicking.

55:20.000 --> 55:31.000
For words or phrases, I want to do what you kindly, I want to do mehabs, because I say mehabs all the time.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
Mehabs, refling, you want to go deeper?

55:37.000 --> 55:42.000
Would you kindly, refling, go deeper with me?

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
Like, oh, those are such good trigger words.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
But yeah.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
Is Strony susceptible to hypnosis?

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Yes!

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
My biggest enemy are mirrors.

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
Unfortunately, I can fall to my own hypnosis, but it only lasts 24 hours.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
It's fine, it's fine.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Would you kindly, would be a lyric?

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Yes, we're literally doing it off of BioShock.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
Look, look, um, we're gamers out here, okay?

56:16.000 --> 56:23.000
We're gamers, we're here for the memes as well, but it doesn't mean we can't incorporate

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
our favorite games into our other activities.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
Strony drilling on the floor in front of a mirror.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
Stop, I want to order so much artwork about all these, like, different plots.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
I'm like, oh no, the reflings have found me.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Just going to beat you into a mirror.

56:46.000 --> 56:55.000
We didn't, oh no, but we are doing hypnosis in general, but I've already done the segment

56:55.000 --> 57:03.000
because I need to be gremlin gamer mode right now, because it's me, I can't help it.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
I'm just a freaking meme lord, it's hard to be serious, okay?

57:08.000 --> 57:16.000
Yeah, enjoy the memes while enjoying our, you didn't finish that segment.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Why are you not finishing?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
We're not here gaming.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
We're only big gamers here, you dun scoops.

57:25.000 --> 57:37.000
Remember that a man, a man leads a slave obeys, and reflings we obey.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
What the orges come from the cutie?

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
Yeah, put on a suit for your serious stream.

57:43.000 --> 57:51.000
Oh, a man chooses, oops, sorry, a man chooses a refling obeys.

57:51.000 --> 57:57.000
Oh wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, wait, pause, pause, pause the tunes.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
Okay, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
Oh hi, I see in berries, hold on, we're caught in bio shock.

58:07.000 --> 58:15.000
A man chooses a refling obeys.

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
Oh wait, why is my freaking calibration, I was looking at the polling.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
Hi, A.C. in snowberries, I promise I'm not trying to hypnotize you, we're in gremlin hours, okay?

58:27.000 --> 58:35.000
Hi, A.C. girl, I was your rave, I hope your voice is okay, I was watching you in the bath again.

58:36.000 --> 58:49.000
I take a bath every morning to try and steam my throat before stream, and A.C. is live, so I was watching her, and she dressed up as a princess the way Mercy Drew are.

58:49.000 --> 58:54.000
If you guys didn't see Mercy Drew, I'll turn it off, it was amazing.

58:56.000 --> 59:04.000
Maybe at the end of stream, I will do, I will do, maybe, serious mode, okay?

59:04.000 --> 59:12.000
I'm actually gonna make sure I'm reading into Sheebie, sorry, I'm reflecting to the screen right now.

59:12.000 --> 59:28.000
But yeah, let's just, hold on, customization, redirect, we partied now, all the snowberries are tired, little babies.

59:28.000 --> 59:36.000
Sheebie's playing call of the lamb, oh my god, I think me and Sheebie may be doing multiplayer call of the lamb.

59:36.000 --> 59:41.000
Is it Sheebie first and then Azura, and then Mercy?

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
Who's coming online first, Azura or Mercy?

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
Eh, Azura or Sheebie?

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
Shoulda picked Mercy.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
Uchi-san, party, hot, tall, that's terrible.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Did Uchi-sans have a good time, or are you all ready for a nap after that?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Hold on, I'll just check, who comes online first.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Is it Azura or is it Azura, Azura?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Wait, where's, I just announced the girls on my screen.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
But yeah, first Azura live in, how long?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Azura's live, oh wait, in 5, 10?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Okay, no, it's definitely Sheebie that comes up next.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Sorry, it was amazing, oh Uchi-sans, time to put you to sleep.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Come here old man, you're done for.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:51.000
You partied so hard with Azura, and she showed you how much energy she has, yeah.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Oh, and if you sub all your energy, Uchi-san, they may pay you to sleep.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Better grant them.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I'm ready to jump on my man.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Yeah, I made a little induction at the end of the stream, but right now we're Kremlin mode, okay?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I can't be serious.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I laughed, I cried, I oooged, I am I supposed to even pronounce that?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Even in our ASMR stream, she speaks fast.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Oh yeah, you think that's speaking fast?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Can you be serious, not for long?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Kremlin mode activated, yeah.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Shhh, we're real ASMRs out here.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I'm speaking in a chanted main craft table.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It's pronounced U-O, U-O.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Surely you can be serious, but what was that?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:18.000
It's called Ace Globes, because A.C. finished their stream, I'm using Ace Globes.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I fell farther in love with my cute and funny Uchi-san loving Oshii, and this is why we don't have chat on screen during ASMR streams.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
What is that? It's the unknown.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Ace should introduce you to Aigar, his Aigar.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Ace Globes are so nice, yeah.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Mercy had some Ace Globes in her ASMR, and Amy got skamaste on Ace Globes.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I don't know if she said the story yet, so I'll let her tell the story.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Ah, I feel better already.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
You and Aigar will get along well.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I feel better already, yeah.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
There's no permanent influence on this stream, what does that mean?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So some hypnosis ASMR is like to mark you and leave you with a present,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:38.000
and I'm not doing that because we are slowly working our way.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:45.000
You have to take things slow and take your time,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and I'm gonna take my time with you briefly and get you all tired.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Oh, it's a reference to the polar bear game.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Would you ever use water next to a $2,000 microphone?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I don't know, this is the best water you're gonna get.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Permanent hypnosis is just a gift that keeps on giving.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Slow indoctrination.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Would you kindly rethink?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Let me do what I want to, yeah.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
It's time to come down from the party snowmaries.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
You're under the sea, don't need hypnosis for that.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Today was already a chill day for me, so this stream was really fit, and I'm glad.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I'll try to do ASMR streams every week.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yeah, my back hurts, okay, true OG sounds for it.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000
But yes, I will do ASMR every week.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Some more intense than the others.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Some plots as well, like fill, probably plots, egg and live.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And I do, like, when I get you guys to talk and give me suggestions,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I do apologize if you typed for me to say something.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I had to make sure it fitted with the theme,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
which is why I brought you up so I can start being a gremlin again,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
because I didn't want you to be down and be gremlin mode.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Big Willy Wallace is probably when my back's gone after that DJ stream.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
That's so good.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I break from my own mind every year.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Oh yeah, some good plots.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Oh yeah, some real deep thought-provoking plots.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Okay, let me see if this is a freaking dragon.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I think, because I want to show off.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Okay.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Okay, I think this better.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
My mouse dragon just kind of stops working after all,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
saying, I think it gets confused with the ASMR mic.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
You like the background, thanks.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I made it myself.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I did it.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I'm not like it in Adobe After Effects.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Bass streamer and vealer.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
All my girls were bass streamer and vealer.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
They're all the best.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Yeah, no.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
You do, you strong, we still love you.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Yeah.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
That background is amazing, yes.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I can also go faster or slower,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
but I'll do that another time.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
But just so that I can really make it intense, okay?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Like, this sound you hear,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I can also make it faster and more intense.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
So please don't think I haven't thought this through.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It's over for you.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Don't resist.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
There's no point in resisting.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Okay, little wreathling.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
You are mine.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Just give me some time.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Just let me kick.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Let me kick.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
There.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And then what?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Oh no, all my money's going into your pocket.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
That's terrible, wreathling.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Yeah.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
That sin doesn't have any side effects.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
No, none of them have secret.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I have no secret agenda.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Thank you, window for cracking during the ASMR stream.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
That window cracked like three times during my segments.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I was like, really, you're getting rude.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I wasn't sure if I liked the background noise,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
but I really like it.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Oh, if you don't like that noise,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
don't worry, I'll train you to like it.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Just stop resisting.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Your efforts are futile.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
You will not win against me.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I have unending stamina.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Are my streams not proof enough?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Wah, thank you for today.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Erwin Blair, thank you for the tip.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Yes, let's give all money to feel it.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Thank you for the tip, Erwin.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Support my babies.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Support my babies so they can move out,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
and I can buy them a better internet connection.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Thank you so much for the tip, though.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I appreciate it greatly.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I need some hydration.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
You can hear some ASMR calls.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Ah, all gone.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Ah, none left.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Thank you.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Wow.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Strani, does the cuttlefish's rope effect only have one speed?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Yes, only one speed.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I didn't want people to think I'm doing a rave.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I'll fight Mummy's unending stamina with my own.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Let's see how it comes out on top.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Me.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Oh, the cuttlefish is amazing.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
The cuttlefish is gonna give...

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Ay-yo, I can't read that out.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Oh, my money's gonna skew, gosh.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
For those of you who did join in a little late,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:34.000
my YouTube channel's been spent for monetization.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I'm actually getting a manicure and a pedicure today

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
in preparation for my monetization stream.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
So there's your hint.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Hopefully it comes through quickly.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And I'm very excited.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Zeroed in audible.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Yeah, I did it into my...

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
But yeah, I'm getting my first ever manicure and pedicure.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I have no idea what...

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
So I think they like massage your legs as well.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So I'm gonna like get nice and smooth and like shave my legs.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Just to make sure they don't have to touch my like stubbly legs.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
But yeah, I will be interesting.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Maybe I should like live tweet my experience

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
and being like, oh, the person's doing this now.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
They're doing this to my foot.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Because I've never had like a pedicure is when it's your feet.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Because pediatry is feet care.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And then manicure, mangy tuples are your hands.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And well, the rest of the VL urgent begin monetization too.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Yes, they are being submitted today.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I believe we are waiting for the YouTube stats to update.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Because they're taking their sweet time.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
It took a week for the statistics to update.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
And then everyone is doing their monetization celebration streams.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And ooh, everyone's eating good.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
That's all I'm gonna say.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
It may as well be...

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Oh no, it may as well be Thanksgiving.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.000
What the fuck?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
My tech...

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
What?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
What the fuck?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
My phone?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
My phone?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
My tech talk?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I was so scared.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Oh my god.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I was so scared.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
My phone...

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
My tech talk just opened up on its own.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Bruh.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
China's listening in.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
What the fuck?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
What the fuck?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
My phone just opened up on its own.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
To play a freaking advertisement to me.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
What was that?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I thought someone was outside in the garden.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I was like, oh my god, there's someone outside my house.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I need to end the stream right now.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
That was scary.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Oh my god.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I got so scared there.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I was like, what?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
China, I'll prove to you, sir.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
My Chinese credit just went up by 100K.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
That was horrifying.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I thought that was...

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I got freaking out.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I was like, what?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I should be the only thing making noise.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
What was that?

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Wow.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
My heart rate has accelerated.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Literally, my social credit just went up.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
What on earth?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I think that was an ad because I opened tech talk.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And then, like, it loaded a video or something.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
We can hire her.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
She said, okay, I'm not doing hypnosis.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I'm gremlin mode.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Read the top.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
That's what you get for having TikTok.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
That's what I get for brain run.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
That was scary.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Jeez.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Okay, what was I saying before that?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Oh, monetization.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Wait, is monetization a trigger word for the TikTok spies?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
They want the money too.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
What is it?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Oh, do you want RBSMR?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I don't think I have a ceiling on it.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
A member ceiling.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
The numbers made fun, honestly.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Because I was talking about monetization and then the hand.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000
TikTok loves monetization.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I said, yeah, give me some of that.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Jeez.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Okay.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Let's drag you back into ASMR.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
That freaked me out.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
That was scary, because I was like, hello?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Hello, who's there?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Refill yourself.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Refilling is like you.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Okay.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Just save money.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Shhh.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I accidentally woke up.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
What happened?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
My freaking phone started playing ads.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Even though I didn't touch my phone at all.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I don't like, I'm not bringing.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I don't like that.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
That was scary.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
We're in your walls.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Oh my gosh.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Okay, let's see if we can do RBSMR.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I need to put you over my hoodie, okay?

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
But maybe a little loud.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But this is my heart.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I'll do this side, because it's easier.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
You have one.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Thank you.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Can you hear it?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Can you hear my heart at all?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
That's my heartbeat.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Is it fast or slow?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
It might be fast, because I'm talking.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
That's why at the doctor's office,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
they tell you not to talk when you take the pressure cuff on your arm.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Do you want to see how fast my heart can go?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
We're going to mess around, okay?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I'm going to turn the volume down.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Okay.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And that's just my heart.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I'm hearing mummies.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
You heard my stomach sound.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Stop.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
That's how fast my heart can really go.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Can I ruin a surprise for you guys?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Because it's my content, I'm allowed to ruin the surprise, okay?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
The stomach was louder than the heart.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I'm going to do an ASMR video, like a role play,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
where you are pregnant and you're in my tummy

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
and I'm talking to you about how proud I am

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and how excited I am for everything you're going to achieve in your life.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
And I can't wait for you to experience the world

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
and it's going to have my actual heartbeat and stomach zones in it.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And I'm going to tell you all that you deserve,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
all the good things in life that happen.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And I'm going to be your cheerleader.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And yeah, I need to get the Artwork Commission though,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
because I need to draw me pregnant with you in my tummy.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And I'll be wearing like a mummy outfit and everything.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.000
So yeah, and I'm going to tell you how excited I am for you

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:04.000
to get to know you and I get to see what your personality is like

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
and you're going to be perfect in every way,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
because there's no way that my little reef link can do any wrong.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
That's strangely, yeah, and you're going to hear my tummy sounds

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
and my heartbeat and my voice is going to be muffled.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
It's going to be like this, okay?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
This is what my voice is going to sound like.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
And I'm so proud of you.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Oh, my voice is so broken.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I'm sorry I broke my voice, so this doesn't sound very pleasant.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But I'm so proud of you and I can't wait to meet you

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000
and I can't wait to watch you grow up

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
and do all the things you love

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
and see what hope is you fall in love with.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
And you're going to be so smart like your mummy.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Your broken voice sounds like sadness.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Oh, no, no, I know it's sad.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I'm sad that I didn't have my cup of tea,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
but I had a lot of fun getting you very deep into the moment.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Who's the daddy?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
You again, reef link.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Don't you not know the feeler lore?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
The reason why I have five dollars is all because of the reef links.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.000
See, in order to make sure that no one reef link can claim that they're the daddy,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
all of us got together, turned the lights out and just went for it.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Okay, we just went for it.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
That's how we have five dollars.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:18.000
We should do that again sometime.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
You want to find you will both get the ace more both hired out.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:29.000
We've actually been confirmed that we are showing up to a convention, but it's in 2025.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But I think it's in California.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Ah.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Yeah.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I'm all the reeflings on the daddy. No, I won't take my mists.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
But yeah, very excited.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I don't know, it would be nice if we could all meet up at a convention, but I don't know how the girls feel about her.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And I have absolutely horrific travelling, sorry.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
So I'm gonna be so high.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I'm gonna be high on medications.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I'm paying for that backstage box.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Honestly, I'm the feather.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Oh, I'm the father, does a backflip.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Getting the VIP treatment.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Oh yeah.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I wish I could go to the con. I don't know if I can go to the con.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000
So please do not book any conventions, like for this whole purpose, in case I show up, that's not how it works.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Mummies do weaknesses, travel and mirrors.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I mean, I'll tell it in another stream, but yeah, it's a very unfun story, surrounding the toilet.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
My backyard would love to go next.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
That would be really cute, yeah.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Understood booking all conventions on the slim chance that you show up, yeah.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Oh my gosh, but then, stick an entire brief worth of people in a tumble dryer, and you basically get all the feel.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.000
If we basically boomed you with five dollars, shall we do it again with another five?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
No, with another six.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Come on, mommy needs to cook.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Like 41 hours away from California.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I think it's in California, I don't know, I actually know where it is.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Six, yeah.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Every jan and vealer, in theory, has six girls, and there should be one design of each that you gravitate towards.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:20.000
That's right, I may not be the smartest, but I know what to do someday, but I like being dumb.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I like reeflings doing all the thinking for me.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
What if you gravitate towards all the designs?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I don't know, I feel like one has to speak to you.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
So you are the oven, I'm just an oven.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I just need you to fill it, let's be dumb together.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You're great, except for the naming part, exactly.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
What do you mean strony 365?

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I wonder if I called myself strony 365, because my secret goal was to stream every single day for a year.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
But, yeah, we're already going to blow that out of the water, unless I'm gravely ill.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Smooth out the brain wrinkles.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
This is something I can get by.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
What if I'm gravitated towards the accent instead?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Then who's out going me?

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I like this accent, that's what tickles your pickle.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Oh, then he might need me, I'll tickle that pickle any day, I will.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
What do you mean?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
You will always be my Oshie.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Oh, thank you.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.000
See, I'm here because Fiche, who doesn't like Fiche, also impressive Xbox, keep collection.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
What's that?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Yeah, he's been an Xbox kid, oh, so cool.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I used to be one of those kids in the YouTube comments that were like,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Xbox is so much cooler than PlayStation.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Yeah, PlayStation sucks, yeah.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
The accent is good, it's above.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
The accent's funny, it can be sexy when I put it on.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I feel like if I want to do a voice that commands you,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I need to go deeper.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I'm a console warfare, and yeah.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000
See, I was bursted, and had to be tested from a carpet sale for a fiber.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
PlayStation died.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Yeah, PlayStation drills.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Strangely, I was on the right team for a day one.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Not beating the comeyoshi allocations.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000
The Scottish accent is sexy, I didn't even know.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Like my actual accent when I'm monthly.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I'm like, oh, who's it going lads?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I'm, yep, this is so as I'm pleased.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
We better have some backpapes at the convention.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
No, that's awful.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I double in 360, but I was a Nintendo kid.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Nintendo was so expensive.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
My dad got me a Nintendo DS,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000
but he was always happier to let me buy like secondhand Xbox 360 games

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
over Nintendo's secondhand, because it was so expensive.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000
We used to have this game shop in the UK called GameStop or Game.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I think they both went bust, I can't remember.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And basically, with what?

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
They went bust, but they used to sell secondhand games,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and that's how I got all my games.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
They used to do what was called trade-ins,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and I would have to trade in my games to get new ones.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I think Game Stations bust now.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Yeah, wasn't it called EB games?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
No.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Now in the UK, not that I know of,

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
you aren't wrong though about Nintendo being far too expensive.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Yes.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And they just shut down the eNintendo store.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I think GameStop is still a thing.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Did you ever go to CEX?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I don't think so.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I think most game stores did a version of a trade-in model.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Yeah, that's how I got my games.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
It's been Game Station.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Oh, maybe it's Game Station.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Study GameStop.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Maybe Game Station.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Just remember, I was a weebabi,

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I just looked at the covers of the games and went,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Dad, I want that one.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
EB is...

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Wait, what?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
EB Games was in the UK.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Oh, yeah, no.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
If it went bust in 2002, yeah,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I never experienced EB games.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I was Xbox for a long time then Switch

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
because the Japanese make some fire games.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Game is still a thing in the UK.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
GameStop is still a thing in the US.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I'll go EB games.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
We're just EB sleepy gamers.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I miss choosing games by the cover

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
now I Google them things endlessly.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Yeah, if you're ever one in a new game

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
to completely time sync

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
and you play PC for mods,

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I recommend the painting of Isaac

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
and I'm not recommending it

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
just so you guys can all princess carry me through the game.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It's a very big game.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Big and gay, big and gay.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Yeah, in the UK,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
this game now, GameStation,

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
all go, go, go.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
EB Games was absorbed by GameStop.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Oh my god, we're getting the lore.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
We're getting the capitalism lore.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Ooh, yeah, painting of Isaac.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Yeah.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
The painting of Isaac doesn't work anymore

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
in your PC, huh?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Yeah, I had an Xbox, just an Xbox.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Oh, the Xbox original.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I wanted to get my 360,

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
but I think it's messed up.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
It's the latest console I own by a country male.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Here's a more hands-down based story.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I'm sure I've just misread that,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
but you actually made cameo.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Yeah, it's like fantasy game.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
It's really nice.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
If you're talking about Xbox exclusives,

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
if you're talking about overall,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
yeah, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
yeah, sorry, you've just miss,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
you've just misspelled Assassin's Creed,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000
it's fine, you spell it as, as in,

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
creed, yeah, no, it's fine,

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
you've just misspelled, don't worry about it.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I can read through your head missing.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Any fellow guitar hero enjoyers?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I wish Army of Two was multiplayer,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
but no, I don't think.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I would love to do Army of Two.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Oh, did you ever have a Game Boy?

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I did, and I had like three Game Boy games.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000
My dad, so if my dad bought the console,

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
he would let me play it basically,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
and he bought a Game Boy,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
and he didn't like it, so he gave it to me.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
And I've played Pokémon Ribby,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I've played Legend of Zelda Minish Cap,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
and one more game.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I'm sure there's one more game I probably played.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
The Minish Cap is my only Zelda game.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Oh, my voice is breaking.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Legend of Zelda Minish Cap.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Oh, sorry.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Oh, no, wait, no, sorry, tapping ASMR.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Little, little tappies.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Doesn't actually sound that nice.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I don't know what 33 Immortals is.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I haven't heard about it, have we?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
What's your favorite Pokémon?

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
And why is it Shantler?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I actually didn't mean Lewek.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Lewek is so cute,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
but see, Pokémon have this thing

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000
where they make a really cute, adorable, creepy Pokémon,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
and then its evolution is Oakland.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I don't even want ugly, ugly evolutions.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Lewek is adorable, it's an MMO.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I don't know, we're knee-deep in RuneScape right now.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
I took the console with me everywhere.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
It'd be the crap out of the paint's worn out,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
but it still works.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Old school games, I don't see.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Literally think of, what is it, Joystick Drift?

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
No, that's not a gender name.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
It's a Joy-Con Drift.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Oh, that's a Joy-Con Drift on Nintendo Switch,

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
but Game Boy Advance's that were made

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
how many years back still work.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I'm catching up on Old School RuneScape vision now.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Did y'all know there was a Pokémon card game on Game Boy?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Nope.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
It's in the up-gaming.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Sorry, my voice is cracking.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Hello, I've got 25 minutes,

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
and then I'm going on official vocal rest,

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
and we are reading into Shibi playing.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
If you didn't know, Cult of the Lamb is a 10 out of 10 game.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I rate it very highly.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I had a Game Boy card game, it was so fun.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Courtney was all, it was Courtney.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
The Game Boy card game was actually really good.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Sorry, you can't go back to sleep, me as well, cook something.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Oh, very good.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
And Jack and Kenabiana.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Ah!

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Ah, yo.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Cult of the Lamb isn't your first update.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Cult of the Lamb's multiplayer,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
so I'm going to force Shibi to play it with me.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I still have my Pokémon card game on Game Boy.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Yeah, I'm going to go to work, see you next dream.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Yeah, I'm ending.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
We're going to redirect into Shibi in 20 minutes, okay?

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000
You should play with us as cultists, then starting.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I don't know how the multiplayer works,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
but we'll see.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Cult of the Lamb is Twitch integration.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I don't know if YouTube wants to do that kind of in-game integration or not.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Damn, it feels like the stream just started.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I mean, in terms of insurance, yeah.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Have you ever played War Thunder?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
No, it's how we...

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
It's local co-op, I could have sworn.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
As all they said, I had multiplayer, am I going crazy?

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
What are you doing after stream?

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I'm going to make a cup of tea to soothe my throat,

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000
and then I'm going to message clippers

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
and check any clips that the girls might have had.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And then I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I can't believe I'm saying that, but yes, I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.000
And then I'm going to edit some ASMRs in preparation of getting monetized,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
so I can upload those 1K special videos,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:38.000
and I will probably write the script for the pregnant with you ASMR

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.000
that I want to make, and I'll most likely contact an artist as well about it.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
But yeah, quite a few things I need to catch up on,

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
especially with the insurance streams.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I'll probably be listening to Shibi in the background as she plays.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000
So whoever said War Thunder, you only play that game if you hate yourself.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
But yes, I have a big day, big day.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I don't know if I should show a picture of my feet and hands afterwards,

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.000
because some people don't like streamers that do hand cam or whatever.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I'm very sorry if, you know, get filler, get filler, get filler.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000
But yeah, literally tomorrow you get to see my hands.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Wow, whilst I eat the American candy, wow.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I get to try A&W visages.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000
It's like a cream and soda, it's said, but I don't normally drink cream and soda.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
And what other? I think there is Twizzlers.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:57.000
There is like Spacey Hot Cheetos or something, or Takis.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I get to try Takis, the scrawny grippers.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Wait, do you want me to put the feet in the stream as well?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I mean, I can do it.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I can put my feet in the stream if you want.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Okay.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
You wish as my command.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000
You guys don't understand, like, you might be used to streamers out here

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
that don't do what you want.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
You do not understand.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I will do what you want.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Send me what you want.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Let me know.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Like, as much as I am in command of you, you are in command of me.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I will think of a humorous way to incorporate my feet into moral stream, okay?

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
College kid names.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
My little baby replaying.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
We need the scrawny thighs.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Can I put thighs? I don't know.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I've not decided on my outfit.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
I think I'm just wearing fishnets, I'm sorry.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I can't believe I actually have to put clothes on for a vacant stream.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
You guys are terrible.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Please, let me put on my smile.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Right, I'm just going to check Marshmallow.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Just because we're actually getting really close to the end.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Oh, that's a lot of Marshmallows.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Oh my.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
That was a lot more than yesterday.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
What's mommy going to do?

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Mommy's going to do whatever she wants to.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Oh, sorry.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I love your hypnosis.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I get happy every time I go under someone else's influence.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I'm so glad I did so well during that section.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Okay, okay, okay.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Hey.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Yeah, sorry.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I'm reading Marshmallows, but pretty much none of them can be said on stream.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Yippee.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
This is the part where I'm supposed to be like a business person.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I'm supposed to be like, oh, but what does my ghost do it?

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Are you a bit of a meat and then as far as wishing marks?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I mean, I could try and do hypnosis again, but it's probably not going to be that good.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I need to be in the zone to corrupt you, but because I've been allowed to meme, I feel like myself.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000
And I'm just some goofy dork, like honestly.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Business strongy, yapper strongy, professional strongy.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I wear so many hats.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Why is animus showing us a strange cold?

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Not enough time.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Your error, goofy dork.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Yay, communist hole.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I've already prayed in obedience.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Jokes on you, how many of them?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Uh...

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Hey strongy, after a year of waiting, you've really surprised me.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Well, I'm just...

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I have been afraid to die for a while and decided I'd support your project regardless of the quality,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.000
but the girls are great and the content is stellar, I'm glad.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I usually just work at lurk and watch streams, but I felt like I had to tell you.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I love mommy and I love when she's... and I love what she's done with the place.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I love you too, little refling.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I'm so glad you love the girls as well.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:11.000
I was really worried that, like, you guys would think, like, go support them, you know?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Cause I'm not.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.000
She said she wasn't in a hidden program and I hope you're having as much as a good time as the reflings are,

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
and in any case, thank you.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Oh, I'm having a good time.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The only reason I ain't doing insurance...

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
That's my voice and this is how I talk.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I'm a little broken, but I can bypass that by whispering at the moment.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
That's the reason why I'm not doing an insurance stream today or tomorrow.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
But don't worry, you can fix me.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I just need some of your ink, okay?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
So send me your ink and marshmallow right now.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Wait, we got a tip. I need to read it.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Let me read it.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Airwind player, thank you for the tip blown away today.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Thank you so much for the hypnosis.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Look forward to what's to come.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Really amazed at how good this is going.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Much love.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Thank you.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Don't strain your voice by whispering too much.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000
It's really weird because I broke...

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.000
So my voice is broken and whispering breaks your voice further,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
but I can bypass my voice right now by whispering.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
It's crazy.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I don't know how it works.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
We whisper.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Yes.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Very inkable.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.000
The urge to use my tongue right now is very high,

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
but I shan't.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
I won't refrain from such sins.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I won't refrain, okay?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Getting, getting, getting incredible.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
But yeah, I'll go on vocal rest for today

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
because I don't have to record anything

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
and I need to send collab partner scripts.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Wow.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
SlySaber, thank you for the tip.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
It says, thanks for the ASMR.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Here's your inking.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
My voice is so broken.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
TinySpany, thank you for the tip.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I just got some iron prayer delivered shop.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
So I'll try score soda for the first time tomorrow on stream

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
when you try chord stuff.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Yay, let's go.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I have iron brew too.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Actually, I'll drink iron brew with you.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Oh, you made me ink.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Like, it's supposed to be good for the throat, okay?

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I'm so professional, okay?

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.000
But yeah, I will definitely take a really good look at marshmallows shortly.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
A lot of them cannot be said.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Mayhaps in membership streams.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000
You never know.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Nine out of ten doctors recommend, oh yeah, our refling doctors.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Good for the throat, sure.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I mean, want to find out.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
This is terrible.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Don't you want to help me?

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Help me feel better.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Come on.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
If you can do something to help me, I'll be good, okay?

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
But you need to be good in return.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Be good for me.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Give me what I need.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Give me what I need.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
That's terrible.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Okay, no going under.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
No going under.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Stop.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
It's just me.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I'm still memeing, okay?

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
I'm still memeing.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Not a doctor, but three years into a doctorate.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
If mummy asks refling's answer,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
what, another tip?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Everyone player, thank you for the tip.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Yeah, it helps, Johnny.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I don't know why sometimes the message displays

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
and then it doesn't display.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
It's been so silly.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Can you make your background go a bit faster?

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Right now, I don't think so.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000
But I do have alternate dingy mobobbers.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Oh wait, here we go.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Are you ready?

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Wait.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Yeah.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I can do like this.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
It's going so fast.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Do we need to slow down or do we need to speed up?

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
That's terrible, isn't it?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Just terrible.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
But that's as fast as I can make it.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
So hopefully that's faster now.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Speed up or slow down?

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Yeah.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Okay.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
That should be the correct settings.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I think.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Trucks on you are always under.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Yeah, I get to set the pace.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Just don't make it too fast.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Don't want anyone out here.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Let's see.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Nero, thank you for the tip.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It says all my ink blocks to you, Johnny.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
You just need to ask,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
have I broken you already?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Yeah?

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Am I alleged to break you?

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Have I still got the effect on my voice,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
or is it normal again?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Wait, what?

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
What?

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
What?

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000
My pupils are broken.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
It's normal.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Okay, you broke us a long time ago.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Can't break what's already broken.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I see a few of you are already broken in for me.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
You broke me at a low.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Your hair looks like the famous spiral candy.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I forgot his name.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I don't know what it is.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
My seashells, or my hair.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I'm going to be honest, I wouldn't take much.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000
It's over.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Over.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
That's cheating, Johnny.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Look, I will get my way.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I said unending stamina.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I meant it.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
He broke me at the one.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
It's too far.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Your voice is so entrancing.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Yeah, when it's not broken.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Hopefully, I will do better soon.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
And I can have much more.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Ismar.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I am folding like a towel.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
No, it's not a spring mill.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Unending stamina gives me every day.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Yeah, it does.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
It should.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Should I do vocal requests

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
for the rest of the stream?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
And you guys take what you want me to do.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
It's to solve it for myself.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I did that under a surface ASMR.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
There's only so much better I can draw.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I'm just skull-brained, okay?

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I'm just a bit skull-brained.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I've already folded and put up in the linen closet

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
ready for use.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
You want shh.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Shhh.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
You're asking for all you want me

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
10 to 0.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
We've only got 8 minutes left.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
8 minutes.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
I don't even know if I'm allowed to do your kissing.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
My dummy's making a noise.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Can you hypnotize us to be good dogs for Shabby's stream?

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
I would love to do that.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Can we do that?

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Can we do that?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Can we please do that?

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Can we please do that?

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Please let me hypnotize you to be a dog for Shabby.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Please, please, please, please, please.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Let me set up for this.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I'm so serious.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I need to set up for this.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Hold on, let me drink some water as well.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I'm so serious.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Or I am so serious.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Okay.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Let me just decrymify myself

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
because we're going serious mode.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Wait, I'll do one last calibration

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000
because this iPhone is killing me.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Okay.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Okay.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Okay.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Let's get to work.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Oh no, that's not it.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Oopsies, played the wrong one.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
There, there.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
I'm not the only one

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
that can look after you this way.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
In fact,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I have five more

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
that I refer to

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
as my daughters.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
There is one

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
who will join you soon.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
She will look after you.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
But there's a catch.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
What a refling.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
You need to be well-behaved.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Okay.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Almost like a dog.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
You know how to be a good dog, don't you?

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
You need to be malleable.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Follow commands.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Be told what to do,

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
what to say,

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000
what to think.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
You are nothing

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
but a pup

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
for her amusement.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
And in the end,

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
you are nothing but a pup.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000
And in turn,

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
you will amuse me.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
So be good.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Don't worry.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000
It'll wear off soon.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000
After her stream.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
But for now,

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
good pup speak.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And they go park.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Don't they?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Yeah.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
And then,

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
they wait

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
on the command

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
of their owner.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
You are orange.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Do you understand?

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000
You do not have

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000
free will.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
You're a mutt

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
ready

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
to do the bidding

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
of your owner.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
So let her have fun,

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000
okay?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And in turn,

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
I will have fun

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
and you

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
will have

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.000
fun.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000
So don't think

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
not until you're told otherwise.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Because in three minutes,

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I'm going to hand

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000
the imaginary leash

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
over

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
to your owner.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Your new owner.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Don't worry.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
It's temporary.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
But you'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Get to play with a new owner for a while.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Good pup.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
You deserve some head pads, don't you?

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Oh, you're a good boy.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Such a good boy.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
And it feels so rewarding

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
to hear praise, doesn't it?

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
In two minutes,

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
you get your new owner,

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000
just temporary,

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
for a little while.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
And she'll give you all

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
the attention you need,

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000
all the love.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
And I'll reward you

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000
extra

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
when you come back to me, okay?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
So you'll be good, won't you?

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Little pup.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I've taught you well.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
You know how to behave.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
So be good.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
In one minute,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
your new owner

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000
will take your leash

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
and build you along with her.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Okay?

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Good little pup.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Such a good,

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
good boy.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Oh,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I hear her.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
She's coming.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
I hope you're ready.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Zero.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Good talk.
