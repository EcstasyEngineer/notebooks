0	1080	I'm trying my ankle.
2880	4220	Wah.
4220	5120	Wah.
5120	5960	It's up.
7360	8280	It's up.
8280	9360	I think it's up.
10760	15280	I've just built this freaking game and the music.
15280	16360	Oh my gosh.
22920	24280	Are you there?
24280	25360	Hopefully I'm live.
26480	29400	I know I've started like nine minutes early,
29440	31880	but I'm just sitting here and I'm like,
31880	34080	I don't want to wait the nine minutes
34080	37000	for when I'm supposed to start my stream time.
37000	39080	I just want to start now.
39080	40120	So I'm starting now.
41360	43720	I just need to make sure I can see I'm live
43720	46160	and then I can close my stream.
46160	48520	Okay, yeah, it says I'm live.
48520	50280	I'm so sorry I've been boozled.
50280	51800	Yes, I put in the wrong day.
51800	53400	I put in the wrong hour.
54800	56480	Shocking behavior.
59760	64760	I have the most kind of like saddest start
65600	67440	to a stream so far.
68840	72640	I got on Marshmallow, but sadly due to text,
72640	76400	I cannot see what the tone is behind
76400	80880	and I've read the Marshmallow as like a veiled threat
80880	84240	or something, but I just want to say
84240	87720	to the person who sent me a cat picture link,
87720	89680	like an actual picture of a cat.
90920	93080	I don't know how to break this to you.
93080	98080	I got my payloads in March after a very rough time
98240	100920	where I realized that life was too short.
100920	105280	I've not owned a pet, okay, since then
105280	108360	and my payloads came into my life in March.
108360	111760	So please, like, I don't know if it was like
111760	113640	a weird threat thing going on
113640	115480	and I know for literally everyone else,
115520	118160	this makes no sense.
118160	120800	But I can't read tone in a text
120800	122960	and it looked like a weird veiled threat
122960	127960	and I just like, I got my payloads in March.
128400	131920	And yeah, I don't know what to tell you.
131920	136200	Like I've visited America as a child at nine years old.
136200	137920	I don't live in America.
137920	140280	I don't know what's going on.
140280	143600	So you identified yourself as not a reefling.
143600	146200	So if it's all good, I'm just gonna, you know,
146200	150120	stream here with my reeflings and we're gonna do our thing.
151440	153960	Hopefully it wasn't actually a threat,
153960	157920	but if it was, then hey-ho, I've addressed it
157920	162920	and I've negated what your evidence was purely
163120	167280	on the basis that I got Gimli and Vigo in March
167280	170760	and that's when I got my payloads.
170760	172560	So yeah, I apologize for that
172600	175400	making absolutely no sense to literally everyone else,
175400	178640	but good morning, good evening, and good afternoon.
178640	180280	It is a wild ride.
180280	182800	You play two games of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
182800	186440	I'm literally not even on my third game stream.
186440	189280	I've never done a second game stream variation.
189280	192160	And it's like, oh, I don't think it's a threat,
192160	193840	but at the same time, my brain's telling me
193840	196560	it's a veiled threat, so I'm just gonna address it that way.
196560	199960	If you didn't mean it, sure, but as I said,
199960	202360	I don't live in America.
202360	206320	I have two cats that I got in March.
206320	210120	They were adopted and yeah, I don't know what else
210120	211960	to tell you, bro.
211960	214720	I'd just appreciate if you left me alone
214720	218360	and I'll just be having fun with my reeflings.
218360	219840	So thanks.
219840	220840	Don't do that again.
224200	228520	Yes, anyway, now that we've got that part over, Jesus.
229280	230720	A little bit of a restless sleep.
230720	232280	May or may not have had diarrhea
232280	234160	because I can't tell context.
234160	239160	However, we're gonna be playing a game
239360	243000	called Needy Streamer Overload.
243000	248000	I just opened it up and it gave me a kind of Windows XP thing.
248920	251400	Windows Vista was like before me.
251400	253760	I'm like, oh, 99% sure.
253760	255760	Wait, Windows Vista.
256600	261600	Like, I don't think I even had, like, wait, when, when,
261680	265080	wait, this is Windows Vista, no, I think Windows Vista
265080	267240	when released it.
270520	273760	Oh, would my dad have had that on the console?
273760	278760	Well, let's give it a Windows Vista or Windows 98.
279240	281440	I don't know what version of Windows, okay?
283360	285400	So we're gonna have a shot at this game.
285400	287200	I don't know what to expect.
287200	291280	Now, a few reflings told me yesterday that for a factoid,
291280	295280	this game apparently has over 500 different endings
295280	296840	or I made that number up
296840	299480	because someone said the game had a ton of endings.
299480	302240	Now, this is gonna be a shorter stream today,
302240	305760	but the good news with it being a shorter stream
305760	310760	is I might be able to release my first ASMR,
310760	314200	like 1K thank you audio, like today,
314200	316520	but I need to go edit it, but it's gonna be, like, fun
316520	319360	and it's clean, it's, like, clean ASMR.
320360	322280	Like, it's literally me just rambling
322280	323720	and, like, tapping away on stuff
323720	325680	and all that kind of thing, so it's cute.
325680	328600	Oh, just, yeah, just a short nine hour stream today.
328600	330960	I'm sure you can strap in the lads and lasses,
330960	332680	don't you worry.
332680	336080	Yeah, only seven are, yeah, easy peasy lemme squeeze there.
337200	339600	I was actually thinking Skyrim,
339600	342680	I've put down Skyrim as two, 12 back to back.
343680	348120	I don't know if I should purposely wake up
348120	350520	right before stream for the Skyrim
350520	352120	and then make a second room
352120	354280	and then we'll do, like, 12 hours
354280	357600	and then in the second room another four hours
357600	360560	and then I think the following day, that 12 hour stream,
360560	363000	I can complete the full achievements.
363840	366920	I'm not 100% sure.
366920	368640	I do have a honey tea with me, though,
368640	371320	so hopefully you have some water, some snackies.
372880	374560	And all that jazz.
374560	377160	But, yes, next week our endurance stream
377160	380160	is going to be Skyrim
384160	386960	and we're also doing an endurance runescape,
386960	388160	old school runescape.
388160	390640	I will tell you what world to be in.
390640	393600	I am going to start on a fresh account.
393600	396720	I am going to buy premium in runescape
396720	399920	but we'll get to that when we get to that, you know what I mean?
400280	402360	So let's stream into it.
402360	405600	Yeah, I'm a bit of a fiend for streaming.
405600	407480	I really enjoy it.
407480	410280	Like, some people, like, due to their circumstances,
410280	411720	like, they can't stream every day
411720	413520	or they find it a bit harder,
413520	415320	like, and mentally it takes its toll.
415320	416160	Me?
417680	420400	Like, I'm about to freaking try out this crazy game
420400	421440	for the first time.
421440	422800	I don't know much about it.
422800	426560	Apparently you can do implied scenes in it,
426560	429840	so I'm like, all right, all right, here we go, here we go.
430720	431920	So I'm interested.
433480	434920	I don't know if it should just get straight into it.
434920	436920	You guys can hear it, it's not too loud.
438280	440120	I was worried about the music being too loud.
440120	443000	I can almost turn it off on my end, but yeah.
443000	446520	Yeah, some streamers, like, kinda just do it circumstances
446520	448280	but I just seem to have the perfect mesh
448280	449920	of, like, missing brain cells here,
449920	451680	a bit of a smooth brain here,
451680	453520	a bit more of a complex surface area
453520	454920	at the section of my brain.
454920	456360	Music's actually a bit quiet, right?
456360	458240	Okay, it's just loud in my headset.
459160	460160	Okay.
460160	461760	I've turned off a bit.
461760	465520	I'm a wee bit close to my mic, but, right.
465520	467840	Oh, it's got a little love heart.
467840	472640	See that, so Mersey was theorized that her heart,
472640	475520	right, this is what I theorized when Mersey thingied.
475520	478600	Mersey's pupils are normal
478600	483400	before her first experience as a yandere occurred
483400	485720	and then her pupils broke
485720	488400	and she can no longer love appropriately.
488400	490600	Like, the concept doesn't exist for her.
490600	492920	If you look back in Amy's lore video,
492920	495080	you'll notice she, her pupils are normal
495080	497240	until she picks up that book.
498240	499400	They have little small details.
499400	500840	Obviously my pupils have always been
500840	502160	a little cuddle fishes.
504280	505120	She's broken.
506520	508480	I started to think that if someone is a beacher
508480	510240	within the entire brain, it's just soup.
510240	515120	Honestly, I would happily join the study data group thing.
515120	518800	You can hook me up because I can prove that I'm pretty dumb.
519880	520720	Like, yeah.
522120	523320	I didn't think to pay attention.
523320	525400	No, there's like little small details
525400	526720	like in everyone's lore.
526720	528680	Like, you know,
528680	533680	AC has scars from the polar bear that she destroyed
534760	536560	and then she raised Feral
536560	539720	and like kind of like all kind of plays back into it.
539720	543960	Like for AC's audio work, she's actually,
543960	546640	hey, this is gonna sound terrible.
546640	547560	I'm so sorry.
547560	549640	This is gonna sound terrible.
549640	554640	In my experience, if there is ever an audio produced
555240	560240	where you the listener may or may not be taking,
560400	564600	have been taken by the band page of,
564600	569600	by the female performer, it always goes down really well.
570040	573560	And I consented AC with the idea
573560	576440	that she doesn't know what Bincent is.
576440	577760	She doesn't know what Bincent is.
577760	579920	So she just jumps on you basically.
580840	583920	No prior warning because she was raised Feral.
583920	584760	So it's not a thing.
584760	588400	Like if you're a bear, you grab what you want instantly.
588400	589240	You wanna eat?
589240	590440	Okay, let's go down to the river.
590440	591440	You wanna climb this tree?
591440	592720	Heck yeah, let's climb this tree.
592720	596840	So yeah, and I kind of made her like that.
596840	598840	I've not made her do anything like that,
598880	601880	but it's just kind of like a small detail
601880	602920	because everyone's like,
602920	604720	oh, this brat needs correction,
604720	607400	or like, oh, G-San, you can't keep up.
607400	611120	And it's kind of interesting to see that dynamic form
611120	613800	because the dynamic in my head was like,
613800	618800	she completely has you wrapped around her claw type thing
619120	623480	and she does what she wants to do, which is so terrible.
624320	629040	But look, this is a fun thing about like going from concept
629040	630400	to actually what's happening now.
630400	635400	Like as I said, girls, I've full control type thing going on.
637640	640160	My update for YouTube monetization,
640160	643920	my statistics have updated and we've been told,
643920	647640	like I can see on my YouTube that I've met the watch hour,
647640	650120	but if I go to apply for monetization,
650120	652560	it says I've only got 88 hours watch time
652560	656760	and I'm like, right, it's been four days.
656760	658600	I would like to apply for it now.
658600	660120	Like I don't have no idea why it's taken
660120	662000	so long to update, it's crazy.
665040	666920	I'm going to take a sipping tin of my tea
666920	668920	and then we'll see what this game provides.
670960	674600	So I am warning you, it is a shorter stream today.
674600	679120	However, I do think Shibi is coming on in two hours.
679120	681120	I think AC is having a rest day.
681120	685320	Shibi and me, is it a rest day for Azura?
685320	687960	I think Azura does double back rest days.
687960	688800	What kind of tea?
688800	690040	It's always the same tea.
691840	694080	But Ash, like I think it's called black tea
694080	697840	or English breakfast tea, either variation with honey.
700600	703960	For once having a tough time sleeping is a good thing.
703960	705640	No, Azura is an ASMR.
705640	707880	Oh my gosh, she's an ASMR today.
707880	711280	Oh, I'm so excited for Azura's ASMR.
711280	714560	Please give her lots of tips unironically.
714560	716880	Oh well, in three ways.
716880	721680	Monetary, your advice, and the other.
723520	726280	She's so nervous, but I know she's going to do perfect.
726280	728480	Like imagine listening, I can hear it now.
728480	732920	Imagine that voice going from ear to ear and her kisses.
732920	734760	Oh, and I hope she hugs me.
734760	736520	I need to, I've not told her to,
736520	738000	like I don't tell anyone what to do,
738000	741600	but if she hugs the mic, heart beat, Azura, heart beat.
742600	744880	Heartbeat and kisses ASMR from Azura.
744880	748360	Yeah, I'm there, I'm already on cloud nine,
748360	750520	I don't know what to tell you.
750520	752520	I don't know what to tell you.
752520	757400	Also, I may have infected Azura and Shibi.
757400	759920	They said they might play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
759920	761880	at a later time, because I've inspired them
761880	764080	and they've read my mind about playing the games.
764080	767680	I'm going to be fangirling so hard
767680	769880	if I get to watch them play Brotherhood.
771760	774600	But good morning, good evening, good afternoon,
774600	777240	or good time zone, like that one we fling said.
778080	780960	No better feeling than chilling your childhood game.
780960	783120	Bro, literally, I feel like I didn't know
783120	784800	Azura played that game,
784800	789800	because she spoke a lot of like watching anime in her 2.0.
790200	793400	So I was like, oh okay, like on a scale of gamer to weave,
793400	797040	I'd say she was weave type thing, and yeah.
797040	800000	We aren't real we flings, YouTube is telling on us.
802000	804240	Evening, let's spread the AC love.
804240	806320	Oh yeah, spreads my AC all over your face.
807920	809680	So Johnny, you've made me want to re-play Ezio.
809680	811480	Oh, it's so good, oh.
811480	814600	We are going to revisit in Octogre,
814600	816640	but my morning has been good,
816640	819040	my pants have been shat successfully.
819040	824040	Oh, I never got Marshmallow from a fart in the toilet, Anon.
825120	826320	I don't think he's here anymore,
826320	830440	I think we lost him in the great cryo chamber, unfortunately.
833400	836720	But literally, I think Amy started her stream yesterday,
836720	838680	and she was like, I shoulda dida dida dida,
838680	840480	and I shoulda dida dida this morning,
840480	842320	because I got a really weird Marshmallow,
842320	844560	and I'm like, I don't want to freaking upset
844560	847400	or offend anyone or anything like that.
847400	849200	And I'm like, I can't read context,
849200	851680	so my brain's like, is someone threatening me?
851680	853040	Ah, I don't know.
853040	854960	But yeah, bizarre, bizarre.
857640	859560	Rip to every one, pants shitted.
859560	860880	Honestly, it was fucking weak again,
860880	864360	I'm not being funny, but it was absolutely,
864360	865200	you know what, you know what,
865200	867880	it's a British word that I don't use often at all,
867880	870200	but I saw it in a TikTok recently.
870200	874880	That's Pongin, like P-O-N-G-E-D,
875600	879400	Pongin, Pongin, Pong, so smells.
879400	881160	It's such a bizarre word.
881160	882920	I don't say that, I'm just like, I just,
882920	886280	that's Rikin, we say Rikin, R-E-E-K-I-N-G.
887760	891040	Rikin, Pongin, oh, honestly, that sounds Dutch.
891040	895160	Pongin, junga, alo, yay, mooroo.
896360	897920	Mengen, oh yeah, Mengen, Rikin.
897920	899680	I say Rikin for smell, I think Mengen's like,
899680	901720	more disgust, but Rikin is for smell.
902080	906200	And British, you've never heard that, Pongin,
906200	909320	like when it Pongs, I wonder if it's an older word.
911480	916400	My gran, my gran, I think she said, oh, that's Pongin.
916400	918480	Although she made me laugh one time,
919600	923480	she calls farts Windy Pops, and I was like,
923480	925720	and I burst out laughing, I've never heard of any
925720	928120	like refer to as Windy Pops before,
928120	929840	and I'm like, oh, okay.
930760	933080	I was like, it's so polite and so British,
933080	935640	like if we end up getting a British fridge in too,
935640	938120	I'm making her say like, ooh, Windy Pops,
938120	940440	like in our wee English accent.
940440	942320	I was saying that we could get a Welsh,
942320	946720	or a Northern Irish, Irish, but sometimes Northern Irish
946720	948760	don't really wanna be referred to as British, you know,
948760	950640	and in which I completely respect and understand,
950640	953680	like let's not get into it, wait until you learn,
953680	955600	wait until we do the history stream
955600	959560	of why the Irish famine, potato famine,
959560	964560	wasn't actually real, thanks to the British Empire, yahoo.
966360	969560	It's ridiculous, but yes, if you didn't know,
969560	972240	a lot of Irish migrated to America,
972240	974160	a lot of Irish migrated to Scotland,
974160	977320	to different parts, to in search of working food,
978880	981680	which is why a lot of you are like,
981680	984520	I'm one eighth Scottish, I'm one eighth Irish type thing.
984560	986080	Heck yeah you are,
986080	989760	because that's how mass migration works,
989760	993120	so you know that one eighth Scottish in you,
993120	995080	that's right, I'm in you right now,
995080	1000080	I'm in your blood supply, I'm beating around there,
1000320	1003920	I'm seeking things in your body,
1003920	1005920	because you're like one sixteenth Scots.
1009160	1011360	As a British person, a lot of things were up for.
1011360	1016360	Well England, with its sanctions on Scotland.
1021200	1024040	Please don't take the strunnies in me, oh yeah.
1025200	1026960	I thought it was meant to be the other way around,
1026960	1029280	look it works both ways here, that's all I'm saying,
1029280	1033400	look some people didn't like it, I respect that, okay?
1033400	1037760	All I'm saying, if I had some sort of sensory organ,
1037760	1040400	it would give me more of a reason to explore even more.
1042360	1045720	One fourth Scottish, let's move, actually.
1046800	1049800	What percent campfire will we tolerate?
1049800	1051280	I see the most common.
1053920	1057640	I have three percent strunnie in me, there we go.
1059440	1061640	The potato famine was not fun for Ireland.
1061640	1064840	Well wait until you learn even more about the issues.
1067680	1070240	Maybe we can do an education stream about it,
1070280	1072080	but I don't want it to be like hate,
1072080	1076080	because I assure you any English twat the day
1077080	1081280	did not have any bearing on the famine, many a minute ago.
1081280	1084000	But I don't mind doing historical education streams,
1084000	1086720	and the reason why Ireland kentatized them with Scotland
1086720	1089840	is because there was mass migration due to that,
1089840	1092720	so I don't mind a cheeky education stream once in a while.
1092720	1096480	I've actually really always enjoyed academics,
1096480	1098800	sadly the social sides of academics,
1098800	1102480	I may have failed that part, but I've always enjoyed it.
1102480	1107480	I'm actually going back to college soon,
1107800	1110040	which I'm excited to talk about.
1110040	1112800	Not now though, man's trying to run a business,
1112800	1114640	you know what I'm saying?
1114640	1116560	Well, I say that, I'm actually passing off it,
1116560	1118600	so it's everyone else's problem, but man.
1120840	1125840	But I am thinking of doing beauty school,
1126000	1129600	beauty school, but listen, hear me out,
1129600	1133000	beauty school dropout, that's a grease thing.
1133000	1135760	The reason why I'm doing beauty school
1135760	1138400	is because I want to get a certificate
1138400	1143400	to possibly open up a little, so you might not know this,
1145200	1147800	you know in salons, they have a spare room,
1147800	1151280	these rooms can be rented out for whatever you want,
1151280	1154280	and I was just thinking on the idea,
1154400	1158080	when time progresses, things do their thing,
1158080	1160960	I might have a pop up at a little ASMR shop,
1160960	1162960	but it's just a little bed in the room,
1162960	1165120	and it would just be so fun, and I love it,
1165120	1167600	because I am genuinely passionate about ASMR.
1167600	1169480	I love the stuff about it,
1169480	1171400	I've tried to research some of the psychology,
1171400	1172800	I've came up with my own theories,
1172800	1174280	not everyone agrees with my theories,
1174280	1176840	but that's because it's just what it is,
1176840	1178440	but I think it would be a lot better.
1178440	1182360	V sucky salon, right, you're done, you're done, you're done.
1182920	1185520	Honestly, the skills you've learned
1185520	1187600	running a business is worth a lot,
1187600	1189280	much more than the MBA.
1191880	1193880	Well, you see skills, but literally,
1193880	1196200	I'm at the process where I'm about to hand
1196200	1199560	everything off now, like I'm so freaking happy,
1200640	1202840	and the only thing I need to worry about is clippers,
1202840	1206360	and there's the possibility, for those of you
1206360	1211360	who have an oh-she-desk and editing skills of the girls,
1212840	1216600	I am 100% open, like once things settle,
1216600	1219040	because I know it takes a while to kind of settle
1219040	1220280	on an oh-she-desk and be like, oh yeah, shit,
1220280	1222240	yeah, I'm gonna watch her consistently.
1222240	1225280	If you have the time, and if you're an editor,
1225280	1229680	I am very open, if you wanted to be a dedicated clipper
1229680	1232520	or highlight editor for that girl,
1232520	1235480	you're welcome to email the website.
1235480	1237520	Just to tell you right now, no,
1237520	1240320	you do not get a open communication with a girl,
1241240	1244400	everything is done through IWL messages,
1244400	1246480	but yeah, if you really enjoy one of the girls
1246480	1249160	and you wanna clip them, or do highlight streams,
1249160	1252560	or funny moments type thing, and wanna get paid for it,
1252560	1255680	hit the website up, because it saves me even more time,
1255680	1259800	because right now I'm, today after the short stream,
1259800	1262640	I'm going to edit my 1K, thank you ASMR,
1262640	1265920	and then upload that, and then I'm gonna send away
1265920	1269280	a few more clips for editing, because the second guy
1269320	1272160	we've got, poor guy, I've left him on red
1272160	1276600	for like six days now, and I'm like, oops, but yeah.
1276600	1279040	I'm definitely gonna have to find a few more clippers,
1279040	1282120	I probably wanna try two more clippers, but yeah.
1282120	1285240	You don't like Vsucky, so you'd say that Vsucky blows,
1285240	1287400	honestly, shawty, shawty.
1287400	1288960	But yes, there's opportunities,
1288960	1292600	please don't think that this is a super closed off thing,
1292600	1294960	I'm happy to tell you about what the process is like
1294960	1298280	when it comes to clips, the reason why
1298320	1300600	subtitles kinda jump at you in clips,
1300600	1303000	is because that's what gets the monkey side of your brain
1303000	1304800	to like keep watching.
1304800	1307720	The editor for Mercy's recent clip,
1307720	1310240	I forgot to put credit in the blonde one,
1310240	1312920	you can edit credit in the description.
1312920	1313760	Right, I need to do that,
1313760	1317160	Mercy has a new short coming out,
1317160	1318880	and the editing style is just,
1320440	1322720	captures the ADHD perfectly,
1322720	1326320	it has insider knowledge about VTubers,
1326320	1328200	like I'm just really happy with it,
1328200	1333200	so if you can edit what Mercy's recently published clips
1333680	1336040	are like, feel free to hit the website up,
1336040	1338400	I'm needing a few more clippers.
1338400	1339720	I'm needing to get,
1341320	1345560	Sheeby needs clips very badly, I need to put up.
1345560	1346640	However,
1348600	1350800	there's like so many little notes I'm like,
1350800	1353320	so I've told the girls to cover up your
1354360	1356040	for now, like as you can see,
1356040	1359840	you can only see my deckliotage at the moment,
1359840	1361880	because I'm a bit worried about
1361880	1364120	what the heck's going on with YouTube right now.
1364120	1366200	I feel like there's still policy updates going,
1366200	1367040	but that's just me.
1367040	1368240	But right, let me finish this team,
1368240	1369360	we'll actually jump into the game,
1369360	1371440	because I have been yapping for 20 minutes,
1371440	1374360	I'm not even, oh that's ridiculous, sorry, I'm so sorry.
1376360	1377960	Goodness gravy, once I get started,
1377960	1380360	I can't even stop, 20 freaking two minutes.
1383200	1384680	That is terrible.
1384680	1386320	Are you looking for clippers?
1386320	1389640	Mm, if you look on Mercy's most recent short,
1389640	1393480	if you can do clips like that, that's pre-made stuff,
1393480	1396600	where I just send you the model and the audio,
1396600	1399000	and then you do the subtitling and all the other fancy,
1399000	1399840	like,
1401360	1403720	then yes, definitely apply.
1403720	1406520	If you mean clipping highlight sections in general,
1407680	1411600	again, I'm gonna see what happens after Gelt's stream.
1415560	1417960	Ah, okay, I finished my tea.
1417960	1419200	I came for the yapping, honestly.
1419200	1420040	Don't worry, there was two points,
1420040	1421560	I was like half yapping, but it was so fun.
1421560	1422400	Yes.
1423520	1425600	Okay, what is this game about?
1425600	1428480	Good question, I actually don't know.
1428480	1432720	So all I know is it's called Needy Streamer Overload.
1432720	1435440	I believe it is one girl,
1435440	1439400	and there's a ton of different endings
1439400	1442080	that we can potentially get,
1442080	1443800	so we're gonna check it out, see how it is.
1443800	1445440	I believe it's a click simulator,
1445440	1447280	so I can't get annoyed at the gameplay,
1447280	1448440	because this is my kind of thing,
1448440	1451440	like, nice chill, doing my thing.
1451440	1453120	Vealur, where the company competition
1453120	1456160	is actually just who's the biggest yapper, honestly.
1456160	1459320	20 minute talking, no gameplay, if you can show me.
1459320	1462120	Honestly, this game is a feature for Life Simulator.
1462120	1462960	Is it actually?
1462960	1463960	Okay, that's good, that's good.
1463960	1466160	I was gonna play YouTube Simulator,
1466160	1469160	and then I was gonna call it like, well, Vealur fail.
1470000	1475000	Okay, okay, so there's day progressions, okay?
1476560	1477880	Okay, you ready?
1479920	1483840	Welcome, day one of five.
1485720	1486720	Man, wait, no.
1486720	1490240	Got the stream account, time to log in and get ready.
1490240	1492640	Click on stream and log in with my,
1494000	1498640	thank you for the tip, Joshua Jones, 22.
1498720	1500560	Oh, there's a cat, oh my god.
1500560	1501760	Meow, meow.
1501760	1504440	Click on stream and log in with the password
1504440	1508920	angelkawaii2, log in.
1509680	1512680	Oh, wait, like angelkawaii2.
1515160	1517160	Sorry, I do things phonetically.
1518880	1521200	I see, you've logged in, this is it, we're,
1522160	1525040	this is where, oh no, everyone knows I can't read now.
1525040	1526240	Ah, it's got to fast.
1526240	1528240	We'll be together no matter what happens online,
1528240	1531040	whether I die or I get arrested or I break,
1531040	1533880	or I get stabbed or I get flamed,
1533880	1536680	or I become god or go crazy.
1536680	1539560	But Jenga, thank you for the tip as well.
1539560	1540400	That's got to happen,
1540400	1541720	the main reason I'm here for overall,
1541720	1543120	thank you for the tip.
1544240	1546560	We'll be together no matter what happens.
1546560	1550120	The internet is truly the festering cesspool of heck,
1550120	1552280	born from modern society.
1553280	1556560	But even so, I have nowhere else to turn to.
1556560	1558720	You're squidding me right now.
1558720	1560280	Doctor Resurgence, thank you for the tip.
1560280	1562240	Okay, you're awesome and I love your accent.
1562240	1564880	Thank you so much for the tip, I appreciate it.
1564880	1566400	Cause I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.
1566400	1567560	I don't want to get out.
1567560	1570480	I don't want to get a proper job.
1570480	1573200	No, she's a need, no.
1573200	1576280	I'm scared of other people, adults pee me off
1576280	1578760	and I'm bum bum, I'm dum dum.
1578760	1582240	And I still want everyone to fawn over me.
1582240	1586320	She wants to be an idol and streamers get fawned over
1587160	1589720	and the most, over the most right now.
1589720	1590880	Oh God, everyone knows I can't read.
1590880	1595280	So that's why I want to be one.
1595280	1597120	Thanks for sizing up all my gear
1597120	1598800	and getting my streams off while you're running.
1598800	1602040	Peach and, my name's Pete.
1602040	1603480	Heck yeah, my name's Pete.
1605120	1606280	When I send you a DM,
1606280	1608160	you can sometimes fix your own reply.
1608160	1609680	When the time comes,
1609680	1612320	make sure you think long and hard what to say.
1612460	1613460	Peach and.
1614360	1615220	Peach on.
1617840	1620240	Yep, you're my Peach and cause you're so.
1620240	1623240	Oh, wait, we're the manager.
1623240	1624480	We're the manager.
1624480	1625640	I mean, you're the only,
1625640	1628120	this is the people that have been emailing the website.
1628120	1629460	That's all I'm going to say when they're like,
1629460	1631600	I want to be a talent manager and have no Thanks.
1631600	1633000	I mean, you're the only person in the world
1633000	1634040	who understands and supports me
1634040	1636040	and you're my one true love and you're also
1636040	1637740	like my producer, so fit,
1637740	1639600	oh, this is the freaking scar.
1639600	1641480	Okay, you're super smart.
1641480	1644120	No, you're super smart for naming them unlike me.
1644120	1647660	So you can gave me, you can tell me or anything and I'll do it.
1647660	1649760	Let's do this, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this,
1649760	1652480	let's do this, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this.
1652480	1655160	Oh, it's almost time.
1655160	1657720	My makeup looks good, got my wig.
1657720	1658880	Perfect.
1658880	1660440	Here we go.
1660440	1663140	Here we go, it's time for my first and go.
1667960	1669160	Wait, this is late.
1670160	1674160	Wait, this is good though.
1676160	1679160	That would not have been cheap to...
1679160	1684160	During each stream, you can delete the annoying comments and choose two coloured comments.
1684160	1685160	Super chat.
1685160	1687160	Keep your cursor in the comment section.
1687160	1688160	What?
1688160	1693160	Keeping your cursor in the comment section will slow the game down a little to make things a bit easier.
1693160	1695160	Kawaii ne.
1695160	1697160	Ohai wo gozaimasu.
1697160	1699160	Nice, cheery.
1699160	1700160	Cute.
1700160	1701160	What?
1701160	1702160	Stream as usual.
1709160	1710160	As usual.
1710160	1711160	God, you're so cute, cute.
1711160	1712160	Kawaii ne.
1712160	1715160	Alright, so we're playing Mod Simulator on Ironical.
1715160	1717160	Wait, YouTube Mod Simulator.
1718160	1720160	Choosing comments.
1722160	1724160	Weird name.
1725160	1727160	Kei Angel.
1727160	1728160	Kanjo?
1728160	1729160	Weird name.
1729160	1730160	Parish!
1733160	1737160	Array of light, illuminating the chaotic internet of today.
1740160	1746160	Bringing happiness to the nerds, floating in this electronic sea.
1748160	1750160	Can I type myself?
1751160	1754160	Wait, so she gets stressed if I miss stuff?
1754160	1756160	Oh boy, here come the nerds in the comment.
1758160	1761160	We're all here just to vibe?
1763160	1766160	So don't be mean.
1766160	1768160	We're all just here to vibe.
1768160	1770160	There's no point in starting calling each other nerds.
1770160	1771160	We're all just trying to enjoy ourselves.
1771160	1773160	A promise of future peace.
1773160	1775160	I'm a little manic and moody, but that's alright.
1775160	1777160	Don't go depression on us.
1777160	1779160	Does that mean?
1779160	1781160	I don't know if it's mean or not.
1781160	1782160	I wouldn't care.
1782160	1785160	I feel like I'm deleting all the comments.
1785160	1786160	Go get therapy.
1786160	1787160	No, right.
1787160	1789160	No, don't be mean so hard.
1789160	1792160	The internet angel has descended.
1793160	1795160	Thank you for gracing us.
1795160	1796160	Cheers.
1797160	1798160	Yeah, read it.
1798160	1800160	Oh, I can tell her to read it.
1800160	1801160	Okay, okay, okay.
1802160	1803160	Let's go.
1804160	1805160	Let's go.
1806160	1808160	We got a little Minecraft.
1810160	1816160	Wait, wait, wait, get out of here.
1817160	1819160	No, don't read it.
1819160	1820160	Delete it.
1822160	1824160	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, delete it.
1824160	1825160	You silly sausage.
1827160	1829160	No, don't delete it.
1829160	1830160	Why?
1832160	1833160	What was that?
1833160	1834160	What was that?
1838160	1840160	Or do I tailor to...
1840160	1841160	Okay, I don't...
1841160	1842160	For goodness sake.
1842160	1844160	I'm a rubbish mod, honestly.
1844160	1845160	So when are you going to show us...
1845160	1847160	See, I would leave that in because I've been like...
1847160	1849160	I've got bikini models.
1849160	1851160	I'm the terrible mod.
1851160	1852160	I feel like...
1852160	1853160	I don't mind.
1853160	1857160	If it's a way for you to get your stuff out, then sure.
1857160	1861160	And while I'm at it, I'm going to be the biggest streamer on YouTube.
1861160	1862160	That's a threat and a promise.
1862160	1864160	Oh my God, threaten us more Kangol.
1864160	1866160	Is it Kangol or K-Angel?
1866160	1868160	I feel like Kangol sounds like Kigo.
1868160	1870160	Right, group Kigo exercises replaying.
1870160	1872160	You've got my support.
1872160	1873160	Go big or go home.
1873160	1876160	So I'm going to shoot for a million.
1876160	1877160	Jesus, lady.
1878160	1879160	You've got my support.
1879160	1880160	Yeah.
1880160	1881160	K-Angel.
1881160	1882160	Kawaii Angel.
1882160	1884160	Oh, Pepega.
1884160	1885160	She literally...
1885160	1888160	An interesting newbie has appeared.
1888160	1891160	No one even freaking types newbie like that.
1891160	1892160	That's ridiculous.
1892160	1895160	Show us what you've got, baby.
1897160	1899160	Anyway, there's still a lot I have to...
1899160	1901160	Anyway, there's still a lot I have to learn.
1901160	1902160	But I'm still going to be here.
1902160	1904160	I can't wait to meet you all.
1904160	1905160	I think that's what she sounds like.
1905160	1907160	Nice to meet you.
1907160	1909160	To meet you nice.
1909160	1911160	Time for a challenge.
1913160	1915160	Thank you for greeting us.
1917160	1919160	I'm K-Angel.
1919160	1921160	Go home.
1921160	1923160	Get out of here.
1923160	1924160	Oops.
1924160	1926160	I don't think I was supposed to do it.
1926160	1928160	You get out of here.
1930160	1934160	Oh, and if you're a backseat gamer, do me a favor and stay away please.
1934160	1936160	Well, what's wrong with freaking getting your hand held?
1936160	1937160	They're games.
1937160	1938160	Nice to meet you.
1938160	1939160	Subscribbled.
1939160	1940160	The birth of a legend.
1940160	1942160	First stream complete.
1942160	1945160	At the end of the stream, I will respond to the comments you choose.
1945160	1947160	The fans love that, so...
1947160	1950160	Aren't I so kind and generous?
1950160	1951160	I guess.
1951160	1952160	Tweeter.
1952160	1953160	Hi, everyone.
1953160	1954160	Wow, this is my first...
1954160	1956160	This is my first time meeting all of you.
1956160	1957160	Oh my god.
1957160	1958160	You're an internet angel.
1958160	1960160	What did you guys think of my first meet?
1960160	1962160	I hope you're right.
1962160	1964160	Oh, I can't read that fast.
1967160	1968160	Oh my god.
1970160	1971160	Oh my god, I'm still shaking.
1971160	1973160	Did you like my performance on stream though?
1973160	1974160	So when she...
1974160	1976160	Her voice is deep here.
1976160	1980160	Kate Angel finally descended upon the world after we spent so long mulling over it.
1980160	1982160	We've got a thousand more subscribers, huh?
1982160	1983160	But that's not enough.
1983160	1985160	I want more people to fawn over me.
1985160	1988160	We're only just getting started.
1992160	1994160	I like that bunches.
1994160	1995160	Best design.
1995160	2001160	I need at least one million fans to satisfy my desperate need for approval.
2001160	2003160	That's crazy dialogue.
2003160	2005160	I wonder what dev team made this.
2005160	2006160	We got to get that.
2006160	2008160	We got to...
2008160	2011160	We got to get to that within our month.
2011160	2013160	That's the most motivation I've got.
2013160	2015160	Oh, she's done it in a month!
2015160	2018160	So let's make this month count.
2018160	2019160	Okay, we have 30 days.
2019160	2024160	We can make Kate Angel the biggest streamer in the world if we work together, right?
2024160	2025160	Yeah.
2026160	2027160	Yup.
2029160	2031160	I love you so much.
2031160	2032160	Oh my god.
2032160	2034160	I really hope we can pull this off.
2034160	2036160	We're counting on you, pizza!
2037160	2038160	We're going to make it happen.
2038160	2039160	It's her dream.
2039160	2040160	We have to make it happen.
2040160	2043160	I might break if you push me too hard,
2043160	2047160	but when that happens, we can just destroy the internet.
2050160	2054160	And anyway, I'll be counting on you tomorrow too.
2056160	2057160	Good night.
2059160	2061160	Okay, so it's a 30-day sim.
2061160	2062160	Okay, okay.
2062160	2063160	Day two.
2064160	2065160	Good morning.
2065160	2067160	It's my first morning as an official streamer.
2067160	2069160	Wait, it's already noon.
2069160	2072160	I'm just not a morning person at all.
2076160	2078160	I was a bit too slow on that.
2078160	2080160	Anyway, since we're aiming for 1 million subscribers,
2080160	2085160	we still need 9,000 more.
2086160	2090160	But first, let's start small and go for 10k first.
2090160	2092160	We'll get there in no time.
2094160	2097160	And as you know, I'm completely useless on my own.
2100160	2102160	So you need to tell me what to do every day.
2102160	2104160	I know you'll make the right...
2104160	2106160	Is this terrible of me to say?
2106160	2109160	But as a manager point of view,
2109160	2113160	it's actually super easy to direct people like this.
2114160	2116160	Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.
2118160	2120160	So I'll do everything you tell me.
2120160	2122160	Really, I have complete faith in you, pizza.
2122160	2124160	I'll follow all your orders perfectly.
2124160	2127160	And I promise I'll become the best streamer.
2127160	2130160	Literally, I feel so bad.
2130160	2133160	But this is the perfect employee.
2135160	2138160	Because if not, I think I'll break and fall apart.
2138160	2139160	Or I could break you.
2141160	2142160	I don't want to be...
2142160	2143160	Oh, fuck it, I'm fucking her.
2143160	2145160	Or I could break you myself.
2145160	2147160	Yeah, you could.
2147160	2148160	Oh my...
2148160	2149160	Wait, she reciprocates.
2152160	2153160	Oh my god.
2153160	2155160	Oh my god, I'm sorry.
2155160	2158160	I'm sorry, my penis typed that on the keyboard.
2158160	2160160	I'm sorry, I couldn't...
2160160	2161160	Gum in the side.
2161160	2163160	I'm sorry.
2163160	2165160	Please don't be creeped out by a manager like that.
2165160	2166160	Right, how do I tell her?
2166160	2167160	Are we done?
2170160	2171160	Hang out.
2171160	2172160	Oh!
2172160	2173160	Okay, okay, hang out.
2173160	2174160	New idea incoming.
2174160	2175160	Sleep.
2175160	2176160	New idea incoming.
2176160	2177160	New...
2177160	2178160	I...
2178160	2179160	Medication!
2179160	2181160	Oh dear, that's not good.
2181160	2183160	Oh, she feels okay.
2184160	2186160	So I'm definitely...
2186160	2188160	Mental darkness.
2188160	2190160	Wow, okay.
2191160	2192160	Oh wait, what does that say?
2192160	2194160	Collect ideas.
2194160	2195160	Okay!
2196160	2198160	I comprehend.
2198160	2200160	To collect ideas,
2200160	2202160	I want you to search the internet
2202160	2204160	for the current Twitter trend
2204160	2206160	of a VTuber model.
2207160	2209160	Social media.
2209160	2210160	Social media.
2210160	2212160	Puts her stress up.
2213160	2214160	Pre-streamer.
2214160	2216160	Vanity search.
2216160	2218160	No, don't do that.
2218160	2220160	Video streaming?
2221160	2222160	No.
2223160	2225160	What's ST?
2225160	2226160	I don't know.
2226160	2227160	Dender.
2227160	2229160	No, you don't need dender, hen.
2229160	2231160	Go follow the latest VTuber trend.
2231160	2232160	I don't care what it is,
2232160	2234160	but go do it for me, darling.
2235160	2237160	Someone I met for the first time today
2237160	2239160	told me you look like you would be
2239160	2241160	really into underground male idols.
2241160	2243160	Do I really?
2244160	2247160	The task manager will show you...
2248160	2250160	Oh, I'm learning, I'm learning.
2250160	2252160	Conspiracy theories are always so interesting to read about.
2252160	2254160	It's so funny seeing people argue about
2254160	2257160	whether they are real or absolute BS.
2257160	2259160	I never get tired of it.
2259160	2260160	Okay, okay.
2262160	2264160	You're actually...
2264160	2266160	so smart?
2266160	2267160	I don't...
2267160	2268160	idea gotten.
2268160	2270160	But you know, I feel like if you go deep enough,
2270160	2272160	you'll end up buying into it.
2272160	2274160	Sooner or later, curiosity killed the cat kind of deal.
2274160	2275160	Well, I'm fine though.
2275160	2277160	I never let that happen to me.
2277160	2280160	I'm the most rational and logical girl in the world,
2280160	2283160	and the only thing that drives me crazy is you.
2283160	2285160	Okay, if it's reciprocated love,
2285160	2288160	then I don't feel bad about being weird.
2288160	2292160	But anyway, I figured that conspiracy theories
2292160	2294160	would make for great content,
2294160	2296160	so let's start this off with a banger.
2296160	2298160	Okay, okay.
2298160	2300160	We can only stream once for the idea we get
2300160	2302160	from commands marked with an exclamation mark.
2302160	2304160	If we stream with a low level idea,
2304160	2308160	we'll be able to find another idea on the next level up.
2308160	2310160	Comprehend, yes.
2310160	2312160	Go to dust.
2313160	2315160	Is that my only choice?
2315160	2317160	I don't really want to cross her out.
2319160	2321160	Okay, it's making me go to dust.
2322160	2327160	I think I messed up your mediflicks recommendation,
2327160	2330160	because I was using your account to watch stuff.
2330160	2332160	I'm sorry, that's fine.
2332160	2334160	Wait, you can't stream...
2334160	2336160	Do you actually need to go to bed?
2337160	2339160	Is she tired already?
2339160	2341160	Do you need to sweep, little one?
2341160	2343160	Or do you need to go again?
2343160	2345160	Does she...
2345160	2347160	Do you want to do internet again?
2347160	2350160	Pre-stream alert goes up, but her stress...
2351160	2353160	It will change time tonight.
2353160	2355160	Okay, okay.
2357160	2359160	I wanted to buy myself a super comfy couch,
2359160	2362160	but if I did that, I think I would never leave it.
2362160	2364160	I think it would turn into a blob.
2364160	2367160	Go to night, and then she can stream.
2367160	2369160	So she can stream at night.
2369160	2371160	Can I want to dye my hair pink something?
2371160	2374160	I think even more people would love me if I did that.
2375160	2377160	Pink is definitely an idol hair.
2377160	2380160	Colour for VTubers is very common.
2380160	2384160	I actually didn't want pink VTuber,
2384160	2386160	but I think purple would have a pink one.
2386160	2388160	In general, let's be honest.
2390160	2392160	Right, chat and chill, all hail the internet.
2392160	2393160	I think that's it.
2393160	2395160	So this is her doing her 2.0, so we'll do that.
2395160	2397160	So, begin.
2398160	2400160	Transform!
2405160	2406160	Honestly?
2406160	2408160	I'm digging this so far.
2408160	2411160	This is already blooming out of expectation.
2411160	2412160	Out of the war.
2413160	2415160	Okay, very, very, very.
2415160	2417160	Stream speed as usual.
2417160	2419160	Hi cuties!
2419160	2421160	I'm the internet angel.
2421160	2424160	I kind of sound like...
2424160	2428160	What the heck, the rabbit from Sonic Heroes?
2429160	2432160	Why does she always say bless or whatever?
2433160	2435160	Clearly because she's...
2435160	2437160	You're blessed to have her in our life.
2437160	2439160	You're so quiet. You're super cute.
2443160	2444160	Feeling a bit blue so I'll be lurking?
2444160	2445160	Lurk away.
2445160	2446160	More than welcome.
2446160	2447160	Hopefully feel a bit better soon.
2447160	2450160	I love the internet because all of the lovely people
2450160	2452160	are willing to listen to you alone
2452160	2454160	and other intentional...
2454160	2455160	Parish!
2455160	2457160	Why, angel?
2458160	2460160	Thank you for your super chat.
2460160	2461160	I love you.
2461160	2462160	I keep reading that.
2462160	2463160	It's Kigo.
2463160	2464160	I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise.
2464160	2466160	My biggest fear is sentiment.
2466160	2469160	I can imagine living a life not being needed by anyone.
2471160	2473160	No, this is too real.
2474160	2476160	Oh no, we're about to put on Mr. Kitty.
2476160	2480160	As the hours pass on, you'll live to know.
2483160	2485160	She sure is bold for a new streamer.
2488160	2490160	Did I need to speed this up?
2491160	2492160	Uh-huh.
2492160	2494160	I love you guys for hearing me out.
2494160	2496160	I'll keep working my hearts for all of you.
2499160	2501160	She says she loves me.
2501160	2502160	She loves me?
2502160	2503160	She loves me?
2503160	2504160	She loves me?
2504160	2505160	I don't know about the rest of you,
2505160	2506160	but your face sure is cute.
2506160	2507160	Okay.
2507160	2508160	Well, I love it.
2508160	2510160	This is the true mod experience.
2510160	2511160	Honestly.
2511160	2512160	Can I speed this up?
2512160	2513160	No, I can.
2514160	2515160	I guess.
2516160	2517160	No takebacks now.
2517160	2519160	Chin hands.
2520160	2522160	Oh, this is chin hands?
2522160	2523160	This pose?
2523160	2526160	I got Mercy have chin hands toggle.
2526160	2529160	Because it's all over if you get bored of me.
2529160	2531160	And I don't want to die yet.
2531160	2532160	Let's go.
2532160	2535160	I'm gonna need more so quickly if I'm done.
2535160	2537160	I didn't bring any more.
2537160	2538160	Please don't die.
2538160	2539160	Please don't die.
2540160	2541160	Oh no.
2544160	2545160	I'm bored.
2545160	2548160	Why would you super tip I'm bored?
2550160	2553160	Let's have a look see.
2553160	2554160	Why Angel?
2554160	2557160	I kind of messed up the super chats, but.
2557160	2560160	I've always been an Angel since I was born.
2560160	2562160	Because I'm just too kawaii.
2563160	2565160	Please don't die.
2567160	2568160	People die.
2568160	2570160	And whether I live or die is all up to my bet.
2570160	2572160	Whoa, steady on.
2574160	2575160	Oh well.
2575160	2577160	What a stream.
2578160	2580160	Thanks to everyone who came along to stream today.
2580160	2582160	Sorry I haven't spent all of my plays.
2582160	2583160	I'm so new to this.
2583160	2584160	Love you all.
2585160	2589160	I never caught on days when Kegel streams.
2589160	2590160	I'm so good.
2590160	2591160	I can't read it.
2591160	2592160	Right.
2595160	2596160	Oh.
2598160	2600160	Dear P-chan.
2600160	2603160	This is Saito from Little Bet Creations.
2603160	2605160	As per our last phone call,
2605160	2608160	your rent is still outstanding and you will have to pay.
2608160	2610160	You have until the 10th to pay for-
2610160	2611160	Oh my god, I'm going to get kicked out.
2611160	2614160	Please forward your payment to the account details below
2614160	2616160	and contact me when you've done so with regards.
2616160	2619160	Please reply to this email with any concerns.
2619160	2620160	I'm sorry.
2620160	2621160	I'm sorry.
2621160	2622160	What is this?
2622160	2625160	Does this mean we need to pay all our rent by day 10?
2625160	2627160	We're broke as heck.
2627160	2629160	We need to be able to monetize our content ASAP.
2629160	2632160	We need to get more than 10k followers first.
2632160	2633160	Easy peasy for us.
2633160	2634160	Let's go.
2634160	2635160	Yes, yes, yes.
2635160	2637160	Oh my god, you're such a hard worker.
2637160	2639160	What the heck is that though?
2639160	2641160	That little bear thing.
2643160	2644160	Right.
2644160	2646160	I need you to-
2646160	2649160	Your stress is really high.
2649160	2651160	How do I de-stress you?
2652160	2653160	Hang out.
2654160	2656160	Play game.
2656160	2659160	Stress goes down by five-
2659160	2661160	No, that's number four.
2661160	2662160	That's four.
2662160	2664160	Affection goes up between us.
2664160	2667160	I don't want her to have to-
2667160	2668160	What's this?
2668160	2670160	Spend time together.
2670160	2674160	Her affection goes up and her stress goes down by six units though.
2676160	2678160	I think we'll do that.
2678160	2680160	No, she needs-
2680160	2681160	Wait.
2682160	2684160	Wait, hold on.
2684160	2685160	It says dot, dot, dot.
2685160	2687160	Love is in the air.
2687160	2689160	Stress goes down significantly but mental darkness-
2689160	2691160	Mental darkness goes down.
2691160	2693160	Affection goes up and stress goes down.
2693160	2695160	This is a win-win.
2696160	2698160	This is the most po-
2698160	2700160	This is the best thing to make her feel better.
2700160	2702160	Sorry, but...
2703160	2708160	Is that that game where it's like 120 levels?
2712160	2716160	I promised to never portray you guys, so please keep on showing me all your love.
2717160	2718160	Oh!
2718160	2719160	Noory.
2719160	2721160	Noory Nelly.
2723160	2724160	What taking?
2724160	2726160	No, what?
2726160	2728160	This shows how much pressure I'm feeling.
2728160	2730160	I might start acting weird if I get too high, so watch out.
2730160	2734160	I may even become more scared of the internet by the day.
2736160	2738160	This displays how much I love you.
2738160	2741160	I'd be sad if I don't love you enough, but if I love you too much,
2741160	2744160	it might be hard to handle to try and strike a good balance.
2744160	2748160	This lets you know how I'm doing mentally.
2748160	2750160	How well I cope with reality will change.
2750160	2754160	Depending on the numbers, it might have a bigger influence over my future,
2754160	2758160	rather than in your future.
2761160	2766160	Show me one hater who bothers to wear clothes that fit them properly.
2766160	2768160	That's the most bizarre thing I've ever read.
2768160	2771160	We're definitely gonna have to research tomorrow.
2772160	2774160	We'll do conspiracies.
2774160	2776160	Why are you here now?
2776160	2778160	Transform!
2779160	2781160	Time for her voice to go like this.
2781160	2783160	Oh, way up there.
2784160	2786160	Men here have each other similar?
2786160	2788160	Is that how it goes?
2788160	2790160	I know there's lots of end-ends, but...
2790160	2791160	Thank you, ladies.
2791160	2792160	It's okay, you two.
2792160	2794160	We're a fixer who controls them.
2794160	2795160	The fixer who controls them?
2795160	2797160	What does that even mean?
2797160	2798160	First time here.
2798160	2799160	Oh, yeah.
2800160	2802160	Is that streaming on TV?
2802160	2803160	Oh, wait. No, sorry.
2803160	2805160	I'm reading parts in the voice.
2805160	2807160	I'm not supposed to.
2808160	2811160	Do you think I can conspiracy theories?
2812160	2813160	I do.
2813160	2814160	I do.
2814160	2815160	Have I read about them?
2815160	2816160	But why?
2818160	2821160	Young nerds love these.
2821160	2824160	That's American viewer-spotted.
2824160	2826160	Annihilate this man.
2829160	2831160	Is this supposed to go faster than this?
2832160	2833160	Oh, I love conspiracy theories.
2833160	2834160	I'm excited.
2834160	2835160	Yes.
2835160	2836160	Okay.
2836160	2837160	Do you like conspiracy?
2837160	2839160	So, my company...
2839160	2840160	I can...
2840160	2841160	Please go again.
2842160	2843160	Oh, that's going too fast.
2843160	2845160	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2845160	2848160	Today, I'll be talking about their culture in conspiracy theories.
2848160	2849160	Like, the fricking...
2849160	2852160	Is it the ET game that's currently...
2852160	2854160	dug into a ditch
2854160	2856160	and it's like 40,000 worth of games or something?
2856160	2858160	Some people say that...
2859160	2860160	They develop organically.
2860160	2861160	Oh, this is going too fast.
2861160	2863160	They wanted to do the Japanese masses
2863160	2864160	into nerds to numb them.
2864160	2865160	Sounds wacky.
2865160	2867160	But what if it did happen?
2867160	2869160	I'm not a nerd.
2871160	2874160	I think we'll do a nicer super chat.
2874160	2875160	I think we could do a super chat
2875160	2877160	that makes her happier than that.
2877160	2879160	But then people get mad if you don't read them out.
2880160	2882160	Everyone watching now would be dancing
2882160	2886160	to the tune of three minds on...
2887160	2889160	Feels like you're going to eventually
2889160	2891160	go off the deep end if you...
2892160	2894160	What, talking about conspiracies?
2894160	2896160	But it's okay, because even if you...
2896160	2897160	We're all...
2897160	2898160	This...
2901160	2903160	I can't even moderate it.
2904160	2905160	I'm not a nerd.
2905160	2906160	I...
2906160	2908160	That's what a nerd says.
2908160	2909160	And she's gone.
2909160	2910160	Just like that.
2910160	2911160	Jeez, right.
2911160	2912160	I'm not clicking that speed up option.
2912160	2913160	My goodness.
2913160	2914160	What was that?
2914160	2915160	You upped the stream speed,
2915160	2916160	but I've tried to lower it.
2916160	2917160	Did I not?
2918160	2919160	Wait, is this her alt?
2920160	2921160	I will...
2922160	2924160	Shatalki Mushroom Yoll on my Privilege
2924160	2925160	and will...
2925160	2927160	As long as one finds that they can
2927160	2929160	stay blissfully unaware.
2929160	2930160	And even if someone does find it,
2930160	2931160	it's not like I'm committing a crime.
2931160	2933160	Even though it does feel like real, just...
2933160	2935160	Wait, so this is her alt.
2935160	2937160	Oh, and this is her mane.
2938160	2939160	Oh, that's a shame.
2939160	2941160	She doesn't even enjoy streaming.
2942160	2943160	Then you do it then.
2944160	2945160	So, but you didn't have to stream
2945160	2946160	if you didn't like it.
2946160	2947160	I don't know why we're...
2947160	2949160	Can you write some good stuff about...
2949160	2951160	Thingy on ST for me?
2952160	2955160	I think it'll be too obvious
2955160	2957160	if I do it myself, so please.
2958160	2959160	Please.
2961160	2963160	Medication gives her an idea.
2964160	2965160	Diazipam?
2969160	2971160	One milligram Diazipam
2971160	2973160	makes her floppy.
2974160	2975160	Brof.
2976160	2977160	Brof.
2977160	2978160	It's five milligrams
2978160	2980160	that'll make you floppy, hen.
2980160	2982160	It's not one milligram.
2982160	2983160	One milligram does nothing.
2983160	2985160	That's a tiddly wink of Diazipam.
2987160	2989160	It's someone who's got the anxiety
2989160	2991160	made, so I assure you, it's five milligrams
2991160	2993160	is when you're gonna feel it.
2993160	2995160	Right, I am going to let her
2995160	2997160	get a new idea by playing games.
2997160	2998160	She used to play some games.
2998160	3000160	She's a lightweight, literally.
3002160	3004160	All you need is a beat a blocker
3004160	3005160	and you're good to go.
3005160	3007160	And if you're really not good to go,
3007160	3008160	Diazipam.
3008160	3010160	I hit my gacha a bunch of all right.
3011160	3012160	We just paid money for that!
3012160	3013160	Did you just spend money
3013160	3015160	when we have to pay rent?
3015160	3017160	Nothing beats a good games.
3018160	3020160	Humans were born to play
3020160	3022160	and I'm getting the hang of this streaming thing,
3022160	3023160	so I want to do a let's play.
3023160	3024160	Let's do this.
3024160	3026160	Yeah, that's exactly what you're supposed to do.
3026160	3028160	Why are these reactions so scuffed?
3029160	3030160	You have a new idea for stream.
3030160	3031160	Let's play throwback stream.
3031160	3033160	Hey, that's what I did!
3033160	3034160	Go to dusk, go to dusk.
3034160	3037160	Right, you can play again.
3038160	3039160	I want you.
3039160	3040160	I need you.
3040160	3041160	I need you.
3041160	3042160	I love you.
3042160	3043160	I love you.
3043160	3046160	Atama no naka.
3047160	3049160	I don't know what the tune is,
3049160	3050160	but I've probably heard it
3050160	3052160	if it's that popular Japanese.
3052160	3053160	I'll let her play twice
3053160	3055160	so she can get two game things.
3057160	3059160	Need to grind, need to grind,
3059160	3061160	need to grind, need to grind, grind.
3062160	3064160	So I put a stress by four
3064160	3065160	and affection up,
3065160	3066160	but I didn't do anything.
3066160	3068160	I just remembered this game I played
3068160	3070160	where you become a big shot
3070160	3071160	who has a global influence
3071160	3072160	or whatever I actually got
3072160	3074160	so into it, I ended up skipping it.
3074160	3076160	What game is that a reference to?
3076160	3078160	I just remembered this game
3079160	3080160	becomes some big shot
3080160	3083160	who has global influence.
3085160	3086160	What game?
3086160	3087160	That must be a reference,
3087160	3088160	but it's so generic.
3090160	3091160	But anyway, I know it's recently
3091160	3092160	a lot of people these days
3092160	3093160	like to play games where you have to
3093160	3095160	rule, power to rule the world
3095160	3097160	and even reduce population and stuff.
3098160	3099160	What are these references to?
3099160	3101160	There must be references to.
3101160	3102160	Is the game,
3103160	3105160	is referencing itself?
3105160	3107160	Oh, Papaga.
3107160	3109160	That's very plausible.
3109160	3111160	And some people also truly believe
3111160	3113160	that's what's happening in our world
3113160	3115160	and make up these wild boogie men
3115160	3117160	to direct their rage at.
3118160	3119160	Wait.
3119160	3120160	Is this because I looked up
3120160	3122160	that conspiracy stuff she's saying this?
3122160	3123160	I don't blame them though.
3123160	3125160	I think considering the times we live in
3125160	3127160	it's not so strange that people want
3127160	3129160	someone or something to be angry at.
3130160	3132160	Not as, not as dissect
3132160	3133160	in human nature.
3133160	3134160	Hold on, this game is,
3134160	3135160	I love it already.
3135160	3137160	What the heck, we're like human nature.
3137160	3139160	But we should all be working together.
3139160	3140160	Please, this is my only wish
3140160	3141160	as an internet angel.
3141160	3142160	Wait, but I'm,
3142160	3144160	I'm eating this up for breakfast.
3144160	3146160	Like, I love the intricate
3146160	3148160	like one human nature, like you need something to
3148160	3150160	sounds good, doesn't it?
3150160	3151160	Well, I'm gonna say that
3151160	3153160	and see how the
3153160	3155160	Schumer's React, they are my li-
3158160	3159160	Girl.
3159160	3161160	Do not bite the hand that feeds.
3161160	3162160	My goodness.
3163160	3166160	Oh no, she was talking about theories.
3166160	3168160	I didn't, only one cover.
3168160	3170160	Wait, am I gonna turn her into a politician?
3171160	3175160	Can I turn her into anti-Margaret Thatcher?
3175160	3178160	Please, can I turn her into our
3178160	3179160	Margaret Thatcher?
3180160	3181160	Stop.
3182160	3183160	Stop, anti-Margaret Thatcher.
3183160	3184160	Let's go.
3184160	3186160	E-girl, anti-Margaret Thatcher.
3187160	3190160	We believe in the public
3190160	3193160	owning the fricking things
3193160	3195160	and the private sector does not
3195160	3196160	own or have stakes.
3197160	3200160	And that the people do not buy out mistakes,
3200160	3202160	buy out companies that go bust
3202160	3203160	because it's not the people's problems
3203160	3205160	for the private companies.
3205160	3206160	Oh my God, yes!
3206160	3208160	Revolution, yes!
3208160	3210160	Oh my God, this game's amazing.
3211160	3213160	Hi guys, it's Chloe Angel,
3213160	3215160	the Napoleon of the Streaming Wall.
3215160	3216160	Who's Napoleon?
3216160	3217160	Right, not you.
3217160	3218160	That's a terrible super chat
3218160	3219160	and you should be embarrassed,
3219160	3220160	but we'll put it in
3220160	3221160	because we can take it out.
3222160	3224160	No way we can do this.
3225160	3227160	In 30 years, our world could be
3227160	3229160	ruled by one body.
3229160	3231160	Also, oh, we're too late for that.
3231160	3232160	Conglomerates are screaming
3232160	3233160	to create...
3235160	3237160	Wait, I can't turn it off.
3238160	3239160	What's a conglomerate?
3239160	3241160	I've done another rabbit hole.
3241160	3243160	The division has already begun.
3243160	3244160	Oh, I haven't long ago.
3244160	3246160	Conglomerates are scheming.
3246160	3247160	They're even trying to reduce
3247160	3249160	the world population to one billion.
3249160	3250160	That's scary.
3250160	3252160	I want to live in an equal society.
3253160	3254160	I'll put it in because it's super chat,
3254160	3256160	but we'll see if we can replace it with something else.
3256160	3257160	What would the world be like
3257160	3259160	ruled by one government?
3259160	3260160	I don't know how I feel about
3260160	3261160	worshiping a fallen angel
3261160	3263160	being an angel myself.
3263160	3265160	Lucifer, hold that guy.
3265160	3266160	You can be my...
3266160	3267160	You can be my fallen angel.
3267160	3268160	Sorry, this is a chat.
3268160	3269160	Keep freaking doing it wrong.
3271160	3273160	I'm already taking action.
3274160	3276160	Your frowny face is so cute.
3279160	3281160	Is there any mean comments?
3281160	3283160	I don't think I've seen any mean comments.
3285160	3286160	Literally, we're playing
3286160	3287160	the binding number Isaac right now.
3287160	3289160	We've got biblical references.
3291160	3295160	I'm kind of curious about
3295160	3296160	that kind of world.
3296160	3298160	Okay, we'll put that in.
3299160	3300160	Wow.
3301160	3303160	I assume if I don't...
3303160	3305160	Like, if I skip this,
3305160	3306160	I'll miss out on, like,
3306160	3308160	she might get stressed.
3309160	3310160	I'll have a peek at the comments.
3310160	3311160	That's scary.
3311160	3312160	I want to live in an equal society.
3312160	3313160	Yeah, but then just sitting around
3313160	3314160	and complaining,
3314160	3315160	I'm going to change everything.
3315160	3316160	Wait, I'm spying.
3316160	3317160	No way!
3317160	3319160	We're freaking starting a revolution
3319160	3321160	as an e-girl, please!
3321160	3322160	Yes, you can...
3322160	3323160	I shall be the new...
3323160	3325160	I'll be the new god of this world!
3325160	3327160	Yes!
3327160	3329160	Oh, my God!
3329160	3330160	Yes!
3330160	3332160	How do I make her do more of this?
3332160	3334160	This is amazing.
3335160	3337160	Oh, my God.
3337160	3339160	Oh, no, it makes her shaky, though.
3339160	3341160	Oh, I don't want her to be upset.
3342160	3343160	No matter what you're doing,
3343160	3344160	you're always bound to end up fighting
3344160	3345160	one way or another.
3345160	3347160	Those who do not fight will not survive.
3347160	3349160	Look at my DM and stop ignoring me.
3350160	3351160	I'm sorry!
3351160	3352160	Where's your webcam?
3352160	3353160	Oh, sorry.
3355160	3357160	Oh, I thought I can head-patter.
3357160	3358160	Can I?
3359160	3360160	Obviously, the first thing you've got to check
3360160	3362160	is that you can touch next to this section,
3362160	3363160	but hey, ho...
3363160	3365160	Oh, I can head-patter!
3365160	3366160	Take that!
3366160	3367160	You like that?
3367160	3368160	Head-patter.
3368160	3369160	Okay.
3369160	3371160	I don't think I can talk to you right now.
3371160	3373160	I've just been focusing on your career,
3373160	3374160	so it's fine.
3374160	3375160	It's fine.
3377160	3378160	Ah.
3378160	3380160	Alex Jones feature for art!
3380160	3383160	I want her to, like, take over the world!
3384160	3386160	I'm going to make an Amazon wish list.
3386160	3387160	What should I put in it?
3387160	3389160	Bath bomb costume and expensive mic.
3389160	3390160	I have to do that.
3390160	3391160	Expensive mic.
3391160	3393160	The people need to hear your words!
3393160	3394160	All right, that's it.
3394160	3395160	Yes!
3395160	3397160	The people need to hear you!
3398160	3400160	So not Kawaii, Nate.
3400160	3401160	Oh, my God.
3401160	3402160	You're so Kawaii.
3402160	3403160	Oh, she's blushing.
3403160	3404160	You're so not cute.
3409160	3410160	Okay.
3410160	3411160	Okay.
3414160	3417160	If this is you complaining about me not interacting with you,
3417160	3418160	my lady,
3418160	3421160	I have to say this is the most rubbish interaction
3421160	3423160	I've ever seen before.
3423160	3425160	We are sending each other emojis,
3425160	3426160	and that's it.
3426160	3427160	You're done.
3427160	3429160	How do I make you do that thing again?
3429160	3430160	How is...
3430160	3432160	What was the one that made her get that row?
3432160	3434160	I want her to do that right more.
3435160	3436160	Her stress go-
3436160	3438160	Oh, her stress is 61?
3438160	3440160	Oh, that's so high.
3442160	3444160	Her mental darkness goes up on social media.
3444160	3445160	I don't want that.
3449160	3451160	Daisling stops call.
3451160	3453160	It makes you feel a streamer's voice is a lifeline,
3453160	3454160	but it'll take too many,
3454160	3456160	and stuff will happen.
3456160	3457160	Okay.
3457160	3458160	Everything just feels more manageable,
3458160	3460160	and it makes you feel kind of floaty.
3461160	3462160	Do we pop one?
3465160	3466160	Fuck it.
3466160	3467160	We'll pop it.
3467160	3469160	What happens to her stress levels?
3471160	3472160	Eh.
3472160	3473160	Madame.
3475160	3476160	Madame.
3476160	3477160	Madame,
3477160	3479160	you did not have to post that on the main account.
3479160	3480160	So her stress went-
3480160	3481160	Wait, that was it?
3481160	3483160	The stress went down by one?
3483160	3484160	That was pathetic.
3484160	3485160	Don't ever do that again.
3485160	3486160	That was rubbish.
3486160	3487160	Oh, my God.
3487160	3488160	She's high as a kite.
3489160	3492160	You are in no state.
3492160	3494160	Is this a jump scare here as well?
3494160	3496160	You're in no state to stream.
3497160	3499160	Yeah, you're in no straight.
3500160	3501160	That was useless.
3502160	3504160	You're not looking at my DMs as quickly as you used to.
3504160	3506160	You don't care about my girlfriend.
3507160	3509160	We got rent to make, honey!
3509160	3511160	Get them yiddies out!
3511160	3513160	I love you, but get them yiddies out.
3513160	3515160	What are you talking about?
3515160	3517160	Right, how did I get her to do that?
3518160	3520160	Come on, become a politician!
3520160	3522160	Go on social media!
3522160	3523160	Oh, wait.
3523160	3524160	I think you just put her stress up more.
3524160	3526160	Oh, I'm really bad at this game.
3527160	3529160	Feels like everyone is a little on edge.
3529160	3530160	Is it because of something they did?
3530160	3532160	Also, please remember the streamer and people too.
3532160	3533160	Oh, my God.
3533160	3534160	I see that tweet all the time.
3534160	3536160	Honestly, this game's pretty mad.
3536160	3537160	I have to admit.
3537160	3538160	I don't know.
3539160	3542160	But then, wait, so how'd I progress?
3542160	3544160	I want more of this one.
3544160	3546160	Take a dive into conspiracy world.
3548160	3549160	I'm not allowed to do it.
3549160	3550160	Or am I allowed to do it?
3550160	3551160	No.
3551160	3553160	I think it regurgitates the stream.
3553160	3554160	So you can't do that.
3555160	3559160	The next idea for conspiracy is on internet video streaming.
3559160	3560160	Okay.
3560160	3562160	Let's do a throwback to a game.
3562160	3564160	I needed her stress.
3564160	3565160	It's getting pretty bad.
3565160	3566160	We're over 50%.
3566160	3569160	We're at 56% stress levels.
3570160	3572160	Oh, I didn't mean to skip that.
3572160	3573160	But I did.
3573160	3574160	You got a lot more stream ideas.
3574160	3575160	Hey, cuties!
3575160	3577160	I'm finding time for me to come.
3577160	3578160	NICE never gets old.
3580160	3581160	As usual.
3581160	3585160	We're going to check out some truly ancient artifacts today.
3585160	3587160	What, like Assassin's Creed Brotherhood?
3588160	3589160	Goodness, gravy.
3590160	3591160	I love games.
3591160	3592160	I'm excited.
3592160	3593160	What games are you playing?
3594160	3596160	The chat would like to know.
3597160	3600160	Hey, I'm just doing my algebra while listening to she's background music.
3600160	3603160	It's such a good adaptation.
3603160	3605160	See, this is so slow.
3605160	3607160	But the next thing is so fast.
3608160	3609160	Can I make her...
3609160	3611160	Gamers, let's go.
3611160	3612160	That's right.
3612160	3613160	Gamers are in the most press.
3613160	3615160	And play some flash games.
3615160	3618160	Oh, I don't even remember any flash games, to be honest.
3621160	3623160	Fancy pants.
3623160	3626160	I think it's the only flash game I remember playing.
3626160	3628160	It had like a mohawk.
3628160	3630160	And it was just like a 2D.
3630160	3633160	You look like you suck at games.
3634160	3636160	And you look like you swallow at games.
3636160	3637160	You're nasty.
3637160	3638160	Thanks for the fives.
3638160	3639160	Going to a rent.
3640160	3642160	Don't know what's going on, but I like it.
3642160	3643160	Yes.
3644160	3646160	As long as you're enjoying yourself.
3646160	3650160	What a lovely freaking chat she's got already.
3650160	3653160	Although her design is like, oh, wow.
3653160	3654160	Wow, this takes me back.
3654160	3657160	This site should be the one.
3657160	3658160	Wait, huh?
3659160	3660160	Don't TOS yourself.
3660160	3661160	Don't TOS.
3661160	3662160	What are you opening?
3662160	3663160	Are you all right?
3663160	3664160	What's wrong?
3665160	3668160	Oh, it's so old that support has ended and we can't play.
3668160	3672160	Girl, you're supposed to pre-open the game before stream for this reason.
3673160	3675160	Of course, literally.
3677160	3680160	That's actually in one of my rule books for the girls.
3680160	3682160	I gave them a document and it said,
3682160	3685160	please open the game before stream to make sure you know it works
3685160	3687160	and have backup games immediately.
3687160	3689160	Yep, there is folks.
3689160	3690160	No, that was rude, I think.
3690160	3691160	You're so silly.
3691160	3692160	That's cute.
3693160	3694160	Lol, this is...
3694160	3696160	This was more interesting, actually.
3696160	3697160	Okay, okay.
3698160	3701160	Literally in the document, I'm like, please open.
3701160	3702160	I'm like, don't cry.
3703160	3705160	Stop pandering to the old fucks on the internet.
3707160	3708160	Are we ages out here?
3708160	3709160	Hold on a minute.
3710160	3711160	I'm not.
3711160	3712160	You're not reading that.
3712160	3713160	That's not nice.
3716160	3717160	That's not nice.
3717160	3720160	Or should I put it in there and then she'll address it?
3720160	3721160	Possibly.
3721160	3723160	I'll put it in so she addresses it and she's like,
3723160	3725160	we're not ages out here.
3725160	3727160	We're just here having a good time, you know what I'm saying?
3727160	3728160	It's okay, there's always next time.
3728160	3730160	You're lucky you're so pretty.
3730160	3731160	You're lucky?
3731160	3732160	No.
3732160	3734160	Yeah, you spawned in, okay?
3734160	3735160	You didn't pick the coordinates.
3735160	3736160	You didn't pick what's going on.
3736160	3738160	Alright, maybe I shouldn't have done that one.
3740160	3741160	Oh, I don't know.
3741160	3742160	Don't cry.
3744160	3746160	There are only three situations
3746160	3748160	where it is appropriate for a woman to cry.
3750160	3751160	Alright.
3751160	3754160	When you get dumped, when you lose your wallet,
3754160	3757160	and when your childhood flash games get discontinued.
3759160	3761160	Sorry, I've got warrable if you can hear me rubbing that.
3761160	3764160	Stop entering to the old folks on the internet.
3765160	3767160	Shut up, I love all of this.
3767160	3768160	That's a cool way.
3768160	3770160	Doesn't matter what age and gender.
3770160	3771160	Okay, yeah, she's sure I'm done.
3771160	3773160	That's what I'm talking about.
3774160	3776160	So much for our first game stream.
3776160	3778160	That's all for today, I guess.
3778160	3779160	Blaze.
3779160	3782160	Welcome to the house of Blaze.
3782160	3783160	Okay.
3790160	3791160	Well, that's it.
3791160	3792160	What can you do?
3792160	3794160	Things are only just getting started,
3794160	3797160	so I have to try even harder from now.
3797160	3799160	Come on, I said stop ignoring me.
3799160	3802160	I'm 500 times more needed.
3802160	3805160	Can I like like these so she knows I'm not ignoring her?
3806160	3807160	I don't know.
3807160	3809160	My fiction 50.
3809160	3811160	Our stress is so high.
3812160	3814160	We need to do something about that.
3814160	3817160	We need to do something about our stress today.
3817160	3818160	I'm getting nervous.
3818160	3819160	I'm getting shaky.
3819160	3820160	Right.
3820160	3823160	For your stress, go and...
3825160	3827160	Our stress goes way down.
3830160	3832160	And the fiction goes way up.
3832160	3836160	But the thing is, the stress goes down by like...
3836160	3838160	What number of difference is that?
3838160	3839160	Eight.
3839160	3843160	Whereas the stress goes down by six on that one.
3843160	3844160	I'm sorry, but a wee...
3844160	3845160	Oh wait, I need to talk to her.
3845160	3846160	Sorry.
3846160	3847160	My new microphone's here.
3847160	3848160	People have been calling about the sense.
3848160	3849160	So this is really good.
3849160	3852160	Maybe I should take it with me to karaoke.
3853160	3855160	Oh my God, yeah, I wanna hear you sing, baby girl.
3857160	3858160	It's lovely time.
3859160	3860160	Oh my God, you're so cute.
3861160	3862160	I'm dead.
3862160	3863160	This is so cute.
3865160	3866160	We'll be together in our next...
3867160	3868160	Oh, are we doing afterlife?
3869160	3871160	Yeah, yeah, together in our afterlife.
3871160	3872160	You believe in that stuff?
3874160	3875160	Okay, right.
3875160	3876160	To bed you go.
3876160	3877160	Go do your thing, baby girl.
3878160	3879160	Let's get that stress level done.
3879160	3880160	Cause I'm getting nervous.
3880160	3881160	I'm getting shaky.
3885160	3886160	Wow, some...
3886160	3889160	What's something you guys are really into these days?
3889160	3890160	Minus.
3891160	3892160	I love everything about...
3894160	3898160	I feel like my brain's gonna leak out of my head from how good it feels.
3898160	3899160	I wanna have...
3900160	3901160	Right, we're at night.
3901160	3902160	Wait, we're at night already?
3902160	3903160	Oh, for goodness sake.
3904160	3908160	One day we'll be one of those couples that can afford to call a taxi to go wherever we want.
3908160	3909160	That is so specific.
3912160	3914160	Yeah, oh my God, I would love that.
3916160	3918160	I'm afraid you need to stream.
3919160	3921160	But her stress is so high.
3923160	3924160	And I never even got her to get a new...
3935160	3936160	I never got...
3937160	3938160	Are you sure you want to proceed?
3938160	3940160	You'll miss out on streaming at night, but I can't.
3941160	3942160	I'm out of idea.
3942160	3945160	Wait, she actually can't just do a zatsu off the top of her head.
3949160	3952160	Wait, what am I supposed to do? Am I to send her to bed?
3952160	3953160	What's going on?
3955160	3956160	I already forgot what I told her to do.
3956160	3957160	Is she doing something?
3957160	3958160	Hold on, Danny.
3960160	3961160	What are you...
3961160	3962160	What are you doing?
3963160	3965160	Are you doing something?
3966160	3968160	Is she doing something?
3969160	3970160	You can give her head pads.
3970160	3971160	Okay.
3971160	3972160	Oh, wow, I didn't know that.
3972160	3973160	What on earth?
3978160	3979160	I'm kind of tired.
3979160	3981160	Thanks for always being so nice to me.
3981160	3982160	Yeah.
3983160	3988160	I should carry on your spirit and be nice to my little nerds every once in a while.
3989160	3990160	Okay.
3991160	3993160	How do I reduce your stress?
3996160	3997160	Sexy stream.
3997160	3999160	Her first ASMR stream.
4000160	4001160	Let's go.
4002160	4003160	Go two to one.
4003160	4005160	So we can't do anything because we're, like, out of time.
4007160	4010160	Can I, like, head pat her until, like, some of the stats go down?
4012160	4013160	I think she was doing something sexy.
4013160	4015160	Honestly, I was like, what's going on?
4015160	4016160	Oh, we're on day seven.
4016160	4017160	Rent's due soon.
4018160	4020160	Hey, what color should I paint my nails?
4020160	4022160	Light blue, purple, rainbow, black.
4023160	4028160	I want to say purple because of her hair streaks and her alternative outfit.
4029160	4033160	Light blue and red for her actual natural self, though.
4038160	4040160	Light blue matches her natural self more.
4040160	4044160	I know black is, like, the thing, but she is going to have to dress up for her stream.
4045160	4047160	Aw, she's actually doing as I say.
4048160	4049160	You're actually such a good girl.
4049160	4050160	You're so clever.
4051160	4052160	Good girl.
4054160	4055160	I did my nails.
4055160	4056160	Aren't they pretty?
4056160	4057160	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4057160	4058160	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
4058160	4059160	Like, it kind of matches.
4060160	4062160	Jake, it's not even me that likes the color.
4064160	4065160	Well, I knew black.
4066160	4067160	Found a new girl.
4067160	4068160	I like more than you.
4068160	4070160	I mean, yeah, you get new Oshis all the time.
4070160	4071160	You're allowed a new Oshie.
4071160	4072160	You don't have to say it.
4072160	4073160	I've allowed, though.
4074160	4075160	You know, some...
4075160	4076160	Right.
4076160	4077160	Stress?
4077160	4078160	Oh, forget the sleep.
4080160	4082160	If she sleeps, sleep until tomorrow.
4082160	4084160	A new idea if I sleep until tomorrow.
4085160	4086160	Aw.
4088160	4089160	Okay.
4089160	4090160	I'm just going to send her a bed.
4090160	4092160	We have an ASMR stream planned for tonight.
4092160	4093160	She's going to sleep.
4093160	4094160	Okay.
4094160	4095160	She's going to sleep.
4095160	4096160	Let her sleep.
4096160	4097160	Right.
4097160	4098160	ASMR time.
4098160	4099160	Get the mic out.
4099160	4101160	Get licking it, young lady.
4101160	4102160	Okay.
4102160	4104160	Did I make myself clear?
4104160	4105160	I want to get ha...
4105160	4106160	Oh.
4106160	4107160	I don't think we...
4107160	4109160	I don't think we're allowed to condone that.
4109160	4111160	Sorry, but no, you're about to do an ASMR stream.
4111160	4114160	And we need to make sure it's YouTube terms of service safe.
4114160	4115160	Okay?
4115160	4117160	So, no, you're not allowed.
4117160	4119160	Go do ASMR.
4119160	4120160	Right now.
4123160	4124160	Hold on.
4124160	4127160	I'm going to reach for a water ball from yesterday.
4127160	4129160	Because I forgot to get a new water ball.
4133160	4134160	Sub-squibble.
4135160	4136160	Any sub-squibblers?
4136160	4137160	First time.
4138160	4139160	Hi, cuties.
4139160	4142160	I hope all of you nerds are going through it today, too.
4142160	4143160	Going through it?
4144160	4145160	Like...
4145160	4148160	The Mr. K is the always best.
4149160	4151160	I want to die!
4151160	4152160	Whoa!
4153160	4155160	I don't think I can allow that.
4155160	4157160	Sorry, I put my hand over my mouth in shock.
4157160	4159160	Because I didn't want to...
4159160	4160160	Like, to...
4160160	4161160	I'm not a nerd.
4161160	4162160	But...
4162160	4163160	But...
4163160	4164160	But...
4165160	4166160	So much...
4166160	4168160	Die show food.
4169160	4172160	You're also good for always trying so hard.
4172160	4174160	It's okay if you're chocolate-er.
4174160	4176160	You can lie to someone.
4176160	4178160	Honestly, I'm starting to agree with her.
4178160	4179160	Hold on a minute.
4179160	4181160	She's actually kind of starting to make sense.
4181160	4184160	Like, sorry, but you actually have been told by the capitalist cogs
4184160	4186160	that you need to be productive for every...
4186160	4188160	Here comes the most jobless of them all.
4188160	4189160	Eh!
4189160	4191160	You have been told that you need to be productive
4191160	4192160	for every second of your life.
4192160	4193160	That's not true.
4193160	4197160	You try harder than any of us.
4199160	4201160	But personally, I hate being told
4201160	4203160	that just being alive is enough.
4203160	4204160	Eh!
4204160	4206160	It's just such an empty-ass compliment.
4206160	4207160	No!
4207160	4208160	Sorry, I'm disagreeing.
4208160	4209160	Hold on a minute.
4209160	4212160	K Angel, you're starting to lose it.
4212160	4214160	Get back on the politician bandwagon.
4214160	4216160	I want you to take over Earth right now.
4216160	4217160	I feel that.
4217160	4218160	Tell him.
4218160	4219160	I feel worse now.
4219160	4220160	Uh, not for...
4220160	4222160	I feel like that's cathartic.
4222160	4223160	Is it cathartic?
4223160	4227160	If someone, like, kind of just gets to vent and chat?
4227160	4230160	I feel like that'll put her stress up, though.
4230160	4232160	But it's, like, cathartic to, like, put it out there
4232160	4233160	to be like, you know what?
4233160	4235160	I'm feeling it!
4235160	4236160	You know?
4236160	4238160	I have a really good pick-me-up for you guys today.
4238160	4240160	ASMR!
4240160	4241160	Here we go.
4241160	4242160	What is it?
4243160	4244160	Yo!
4245160	4247160	I'll be your team yell.
4248160	4250160	I'll be your team yell.
4254160	4255160	Smooch!
4256160	4257160	Smooch!
4257160	4258160	Is that what I'm supposed to say?
4258160	4260160	I don't know if I'm supposed to go muah or smooch.
4260160	4263160	You're my real life Angel.
4267160	4268160	Love you.
4269160	4271160	I've always wanted to try that.
4271160	4274160	But now that I have, I'm so embarrassed I could die.
4274160	4276160	May I stop keeping going?
4276160	4278160	No, I'm not going to stop.
4280160	4281160	I need to stop.
4281160	4282160	I need to stop.
4282160	4283160	Can you take it off?
4286160	4287160	Yeah, we're gonna...
4288160	4289160	I'll give it an A+.
4289160	4290160	My first kiss.
4292160	4293160	I'm so happy.
4294160	4295160	Then die.
4299160	4301160	Thank you for the tip.
4301160	4303160	But no, I'm not gonna...
4303160	4305160	This pandering feels forced.
4305160	4306160	It's weird.
4306160	4308160	Is that gonna stress her out?
4312160	4315160	I think because we know she's role-playing, it will.
4315160	4316160	Thank you for the tip.
4316160	4318160	Okay, that's much nicer.
4319160	4321160	I don't want her to get stressed out
4321160	4325160	because I'm already struggling with her stress at the moment.
4325160	4327160	She looks like Monka.
4328160	4329160	Do it again, please.
4329160	4330160	You're too cute.
4331160	4332160	Yes.
4332160	4333160	Ratchets in a way.
4333160	4334160	I don't know if we're gonna make rent.
4334160	4336160	I'm gonna make you my girlfriend.
4341160	4342160	This is...
4342160	4345160	I always send the girls these little symbols
4345160	4347160	all the time in my messages.
4347160	4349160	And they're just surrounding me.
4351160	4352160	Love.
4352160	4353160	Love.
4353160	4355160	Love and thank you for the super chat, too.
4355160	4358160	I love a man who can send me both love and money.
4358160	4359160	Love and money.
4360160	4362160	And thank you kiss for you.
4362160	4364160	And I'll thank you kiss for you more.
4364160	4365160	Thanks.
4365160	4366160	Please go down.
4372160	4374160	Why did you say that?
4374160	4376160	Are you squidding me right now?
4376160	4377160	Why did you say that?
4378160	4381160	Beryl, I thank you kiss for you more.
4382160	4385160	Why did she say that at the end of the stream?
4386160	4389160	Why did you say go die at the end of a super chat?
4392160	4393160	What?
4394160	4397160	I was so confused why she randomly came over that.
4397160	4398160	Did you see her?
4398160	4400160	Hey, did you all like what you saw the date?
4400160	4402160	If you did, let's play again tomorrow.
4403160	4406160	Did some basic ass pandering in my stats or skyroll?
4407160	4408160	Oh, wow.
4408160	4409160	I actually did.
4409160	4412160	Oh, her stress is so high after that.
4413160	4416160	But the longest way around is the shortest way home, right?
4416160	4418160	I can't just ignore the groves.
4419160	4420160	One new Twitter.
4420160	4421160	I missed it.
4421160	4422160	You guys are having...
4422160	4424160	You guys are having a really tough time in life.
4424160	4426160	When you're in life, things are doing overwhelming.
4426160	4427160	But shut up, everyone.
4427160	4429160	As long as you're not falling forward,
4429160	4431160	you'll find me waiting for you on the internet.
4432160	4433160	Is that the end?
4433160	4434160	Do you need a head part?
4437160	4440160	Is there a secret to the stress level thing?
4440160	4443160	I think I'm not achieving whatever it is.
4443160	4445160	I don't want her to break.
4447160	4448160	I reached 10.
4448160	4449160	I want to do a celebration stream,
4449160	4450160	but you know, 10k is a nice number,
4450160	4451160	but that's about it.
4451160	4452160	Yeah, go for it.
4452160	4453160	It's very...
4453160	4456160	I was actually speaking to the girls about this.
4456160	4458160	The first step I'm taking is a legendary angel,
4458160	4460160	but I'm going to get everyone to celebrate it.
4460160	4461160	No takes back.
4461160	4462160	You will love me for...
4462160	4463160	I don't know about you, Andrea.
4466160	4467160	You have a new idea.
4467160	4468160	Internet Angel, the internet and me.
4468160	4469160	Thanks for 10k.
4469160	4470160	Okay.
4470160	4471160	That happened naturally,
4471160	4473160	so I can fully de-stress her today
4473160	4475160	without needing to come up with ideas.
4475160	4477160	Wait, she's going to get an idea
4477160	4479160	if I do this to her?
4481160	4483160	It drops her...
4483160	4485160	Wait, what does this do?
4485160	4487160	Wait, two gaming...
4487160	4490160	Oh, but she gets a new idea if I do this.
4490160	4493160	I don't know what the thing is, though.
4493160	4495160	Rest and touching grass,
4495160	4496160	like a real streamer stress management.
4496160	4498160	Literally, we need to take her out
4498160	4499160	and go meet Gami.
4499160	4500160	So when she meets Gami,
4500160	4502160	things just even out, you know?
4502160	4504160	Thank God they didn't introduce you
4504160	4506160	to demonetising.
4506160	4508160	I'm not even monetised yet.
4508160	4509160	They won't update my stats,
4509160	4511160	so I can't even get my stats.
4511160	4512160	She gets a new stream idea
4512160	4514160	if I do this, though.
4514160	4517160	And she doesn't, if we do play stress
4517160	4520160	and things, internet.
4520160	4524160	Her stress goes up exponentially.
4524160	4527160	Mental darkness.
4527160	4529160	Cine...
4529160	4530160	Video streaming.
4530160	4532160	Watch a movie.
4532160	4534160	It takes her to dust.
4534160	4535160	You know what?
4535160	4537160	She's not actually sat and watched something.
4537160	4539160	Oh, no, she's crying!
4539160	4540160	Wait, you didn't want to watch that?
4540160	4541160	I'm sorry.
4541160	4543160	Were we supposed to do something?
4543160	4544160	Oops.
4544160	4545160	I think so, didn't I?
4545160	4547160	I keep looking up there.
4547160	4549160	I'm rattling the channel page
4549160	4551160	for the prison door screen monetised story.
4551160	4553160	They just won't update the stats.
4553160	4554160	I don't know why.
4554160	4556160	The streaming site I use updated.
4556160	4558160	I've got, like, idle anime, truly.
4558160	4562160	And the best ones are the kids' idle anime.
4562160	4563160	It's not idle.
4563160	4565160	I'm glad you love it.
4565160	4567160	Well, I guess that's why the page on the TV
4567160	4568160	is my best though.
4568160	4569160	Right!
4569160	4570160	For any TV shows,
4570160	4571160	really good inspiration for my streams.
4571160	4573160	If there's anything you guys would like me to do,
4573160	4574160	let me know in the replies
4574160	4575160	and maybe I could do something
4575160	4578160	that we could always have somewhere.
4578160	4582160	A girl's idle journey in a kid's anime.
4582160	4583160	Okay, okay, okay.
4583160	4584160	Shake a prompt.
4584160	4589160	Uh, stress is still faking high.
4589160	4592160	Mmm.
4592160	4593160	I'll miss...
4593160	4596160	Yeah, I'll miss stream if I do that.
4596160	4598160	Is there an internet?
4598160	4600160	It only puts it down by four,
4600160	4602160	but it gives her another...
4602160	4604160	This doesn't do anything?
4604160	4606160	I don't know, it's dindered.
4606160	4608160	I don't know why.
4608160	4610160	That puts her stress down by four
4610160	4613160	and gives her a new news stream idea.
4614160	4616160	That takes her to the next date.
4616160	4617160	No, I think we're just going to have
4617160	4618160	to do spend time together
4618160	4619160	and put affection up.
4619160	4620160	Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.
4620160	4621160	Apparently with this credit card thing,
4621160	4622160	we can...
4622160	4623160	No!
4623160	4624160	No!
4624160	4625160	No!
4625160	4626160	No!
4626160	4627160	Credit cards are bad.
4627160	4628160	They're not real credit...
4628160	4629160	No!
4629160	4630160	Don't...
4630160	4631160	I'll punch you.
4631160	4632160	I don't care,
4632160	4633160	you can beat me up
4633160	4634160	and spit in my mouth.
4634160	4635160	Do whatever you want.
4635160	4636160	You will not know peace.
4636160	4637160	Oh my God,
4637160	4638160	this is literally what I'm asking for.
4638160	4639160	I love it.
4639160	4640160	I love you so much.
4640160	4641160	Oh my God,
4641160	4642160	you just read my mind?
4642160	4643160	Oh, it says read when she reads it.
4643160	4645160	Oh, that's kind of scary, actually.
4645160	4646160	Right, what?
4647160	4648160	Wait, what is this?
4650160	4652160	Affection goes up during game.
4652160	4654160	Game or girl goes up.
4654160	4656160	But experience goes up.
4656160	4658160	Ah, maybe...
4658160	4660160	Does make stress 67s better.
4662160	4664160	Are we going for the end ending?
4664160	4665160	I don't know what endings there are.
4665160	4666160	I've not played the game before.
4666160	4668160	Click anywhere to give a head pat.
4668160	4669160	More.
4669160	4670160	Spend the whole day lasering.
4670160	4672160	Oh wait, did I just skip stream?
4674160	4676160	Oh, no.
4676160	4677160	Maybe?
4678160	4679160	No, no.
4679160	4680160	It's time to stream.
4680160	4681160	Okay, my apologies.
4682160	4685160	Let's celebrate your 10k milestone,
4685160	4686160	because that's fantastic.
4686160	4687160	As I was saying before,
4687160	4689160	I got interrupted by my own thoughts.
4689160	4691160	I actually said to the girls,
4691160	4692160	like, unfortunately,
4692160	4695160	like, you kind of have to celebrate numbers
4695160	4696160	as they come through
4696160	4698160	to like make the tripper news or whatever.
4698160	4700160	And like, it's really annoying.
4700160	4701160	I don't like playing that game,
4701160	4703160	but you do have to play that angle
4703160	4704160	as a Vtuber,
4704160	4706160	and it's like a bit like...
4706160	4707160	I don't like it at all.
4708160	4709160	You gotta do what you gotta do.
4710160	4711160	Hi, here we go.
4711160	4712160	Hey cuties, it's me,
4712160	4713160	Angel...
4713160	4714160	Wait.
4714160	4716160	You're not reading comments for the stream.
4716160	4717160	Hey cuties, it's me,
4717160	4718160	Angel, Cypher, CypherSpace.
4718160	4721160	You're crossing over my fingers.
4721160	4723160	This stream is one to celebrate.
4723160	4724160	Celebrate?
4724160	4725160	What do you ask?
4725160	4727160	Well, did you not read the title?
4727160	4729160	Don't know how to make things for that game.
4730160	4732160	I can't do anything actually.
4733160	4734160	Um...
4738160	4740160	Take your top off.
4740160	4741160	Wait, I can't.
4743160	4745160	This is nothing for you, I'm sure.
4745160	4747160	I guess just skip ahead,
4747160	4748160	honestly, because...
4748160	4749160	no.
4749160	4750160	That's right.
4750160	4751160	Hi, King Angel!
4751160	4754160	Have received 10,000 subscribers!
4755160	4756160	You're such a...
4756160	4757160	You could get away with...
4757160	4759160	You could get way more subscribers.
4759160	4760160	Oh, I can...
4760160	4761160	I'm only gonna get bigger and bigger.
4761160	4763160	I'm just gonna shine brighter than ever.
4763160	4764160	Just watch.
4764160	4765160	Everyone, subscribe.
4765160	4767160	We need to blow...
4767160	4768160	up.
4768160	4770160	Celebrate with something tasty.
4770160	4772160	Well, let's talk about the internet today.
4772160	4773160	I bet you guys are...
4773160	4774160	I can't read the path.
4774160	4775160	You know, I really hated adults.
4775160	4776160	They're all so fake.
4776160	4777160	Adults?
4777160	4778160	Girl, aren't you 18 plus?
4779160	4780160	I'm getting nervous.
4780160	4781160	Are you 18?
4782160	4783160	I'm getting swayed.
4783160	4784160	What's going on here?
4784160	4786160	There's always a lot of adults on the internet,
4786160	4787160	but they're all...
4787160	4789160	But they were all true to themselves.
4790160	4792160	Why do I find you being a dropout cute?
4793160	4794160	Pat-pat-pats.
4794160	4797160	They weren't ashamed of being into anime or manga.
4797160	4799160	They were so free, so natural.
4801160	4802160	I thought to myself,
4802160	4803160	I want to live like that.
4803160	4806160	I want to live on the internet and be my drizzle.
4806160	4807160	I guess I wasn't too interested,
4807160	4809160	but I'm glad I could share with you guys less.
4809160	4810160	She said,
4810160	4812160	you talk too fast for me when I put you on this mode.
4812160	4814160	Jeez, the stream's already over.
4814160	4815160	I'm gonna do a dang thing.
4817160	4819160	Hello, you are all pure cinnamon world...
4820160	4821160	Nerds.
4821160	4823160	Thanks for celebrating 10k with me.
4823160	4824160	I'm going to keep working so hard
4824160	4825160	that everyone in the world knows my name.
4825160	4826160	Please use that in a year's work.
4829160	4830160	Look, I draw some fan art.
4830160	4832160	Oh, that's so cool.
4834160	4836160	That's so cool.
4837160	4839160	Getting fan art is honestly crazy.
4839160	4840160	I have to admit.
4841160	4843160	Can I save it or send it to her
4843160	4845160	so she can see it just so she knows?
4850160	4852160	Oh, the night time trim is actually really nice.
4852160	4854160	It reminds me of that Russian song
4854160	4857160	that goes la la la la la la la la la la la la la.
4858160	4859160	Best of me.
4860160	4861160	She's 17!
4863160	4865160	Am I ignoring her DMs again?
4865160	4867160	How do I ignore them by accident?
4867160	4868160	I'm sorry, I love you.
4868160	4869160	I'm sorry.
4871160	4872160	Can you get an achievement
4872160	4874160	for clicking her head 100 times in a row?
4879160	4881160	Okay, that's as fast as I can click.
4881160	4883160	If I didn't make her happy, I wouldn't have won.
4886160	4887160	I can hear that in the chat.
4889160	4891160	Shit! Wait, she's actually 17.
4895160	4897160	I very strongly think that any content creator
4897160	4899160	should be at least 18 years old.
4903160	4905160	Sponsorships, trying out new drinks?
4905160	4906160	I got DM...
4906160	4907160	Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
4907160	4908160	Oh my god, that's amazing.
4908160	4909160	Oh my god, love you.
4909160	4910160	Oh my god, you're so cool.
4910160	4911160	She's gonna know I haven't...
4911160	4912160	Are you sure?
4912160	4913160	Yeah!
4913160	4914160	Yeah, this, I'm so sure.
4916160	4917160	Wait, what did she ask?
4917160	4918160	I don't pay attention.
4919160	4920160	I got DM'd about sponsorship.
4920160	4922160	Sponsorships, we're entering the big leagues.
4922160	4923160	Let's see what it says.
4923160	4924160	We'd like for you to review
4924160	4925160	of our new...
4926160	4927160	Natto?
4927160	4930160	Wait, Natto is that fermented soybeans?
4931160	4932160	Flavoured cola?
4932160	4934160	And they said they'll pay me a year's supply.
4935160	4936160	No!
4937160	4940160	You have to accept US dollars for payment.
4940160	4944160	You do not ever, ever entertain a sponsorship
4944160	4947160	that say, we'll pay you with our product.
4947160	4948160	No!
4948160	4951160	Hard-earned, cold cash.
4951160	4955160	Do not entertain, respond, reply.
4955160	4956160	Okay?
4956160	4957160	This is true.
4957160	4958160	Yeah, why not?
4958160	4959160	A job's a job.
4959160	4961160	No, we are not doing that stream.
4961160	4963160	Absolute waste of time.
4963160	4967160	I'm going to send you to do that internet thing
4967160	4969160	because I want you to become a politician.
4969160	4971160	But her stress goes up.
4975160	4977160	Her mental darkness goes up.
4977160	4979160	But her stress goes down?
4979160	4981160	No, her affection goes down.
4983160	4986160	We will do...
4986160	4992160	Is ST going to give me the fricking politician angle?
4992160	4994160	I want her to take over the world.
4996160	4998160	This takes me to dusk?
4998160	5000160	Congrats on getting monetised.
5000160	5002160	Why are they happy about that?
5003160	5006160	So they can be her paper already down.
5007160	5008160	Wait, what's this?
5008160	5010160	This bottom book.
5010160	5011160	POST!
5011160	5013160	Oh no, her stress goes up.
5013160	5014160	No, we ain't doing that.
5014160	5015160	Your stress goes up.
5015160	5017160	You go watch some cinema.
5021160	5023160	I've been streaming a lot of anime by myself.
5023160	5026160	Let me know in the replies if you have recommendations.
5026160	5028160	Lying around and watching anime.
5028160	5029160	Late...
5029160	5032160	Late night anime is probably my favourite thing ever.
5032160	5033160	Maybe I'll talk about conspir-
5033160	5035160	YES!
5035160	5037160	YES!
5037160	5038160	Absolutely.
5038160	5039160	Do it.
5039160	5040160	But you know I'm a little scared to-
5040160	5042160	No, keep talking about it.
5042160	5043160	You're going to rule the world.
5043160	5045160	You will rule the world.
5045160	5047160	You must.
5047160	5048160	You must.
5048160	5049160	I don't think I have to do it.
5049160	5050160	No, you have to do it.
5050160	5054160	But I don't think I have to duel too much on that.
5054160	5060160	Plus, I guess believing in them is kind of like its own brand of happiness.
5060160	5062160	Please!
5062160	5066160	But I think I'll talk about microchip snakes.
5066160	5067160	Those are one of my favourites.
5067160	5068160	YES!
5068160	5069160	YES!
5069160	5071160	Your PCs can scan the layout of your house.
5071160	5072160	YES!
5072160	5074160	I remember watching a talk show once in the sky.
5074160	5076160	He was talking about an urban legend and another guest.
5076160	5078160	It's like you got microchipped into you and then the guy was like,
5078160	5080160	I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you.
5080160	5082160	It was the most dead pan face ever.
5082160	5086160	That was what made me look into this whole microchip business.
5086160	5091160	In the first place, I guess I want to talk about it because of how plausible it is.
5091160	5092160	YES!
5092160	5093160	YES!
5093160	5094160	YES!
5094160	5095160	YES!
5095160	5096160	YES!
5096160	5100160	I want her to be like I'm a conspiracy nut.
5100160	5105160	I've been falling asleep with my eyes open so if you see me doing that, please close
5105160	5106160	your eyes.
5106160	5108160	Please close my eyes for me.
5108160	5110160	What the heck?
5110160	5112160	Yeah, I will.
5112160	5113160	Oh my god.
5113160	5119160	Right, I'm just going to de-stress her because we already know what she's going to do.
5119160	5126160	I put her stress up to post on social media which is such a shame.
5126160	5131160	Video streaming seems like such a safe thing to make her less stressed.
5131160	5135160	I'll do that and then we'll stream conspiracy theory.
5135160	5138160	Oh tiny spiny, thank you for the tip.
5138160	5140160	It's work time for me against Ronnie but enjoy the game.
5140160	5143160	You'll probably all find I'm done but I'll catch up later.
5143160	5144160	Yes, thank you so much.
5144160	5147160	Unfortunately, it is a shorter stream but yes, have fun at work and thank you so very
5147160	5148160	much for the kind tip.
5148160	5150160	I appreciate it.
5150160	5154160	I love videos where the person just talks about what they like even better if you learn
5154160	5155160	something new from it.
5155160	5156160	YES!
5156160	5157160	Agreed.
5157160	5162160	I may be dumb dumb with mental issues and a horrific academic record.
5162160	5164160	Wait, hold on a minute.
5164160	5166160	Hold on a minute.
5166160	5169160	This is a henabit too close to home.
5169160	5173160	But I still want to share all the things I've turned up researching these things.
5173160	5175160	Wait, wait a minute.
5175160	5176160	Hold on a minute.
5176160	5178160	She wants to do education streams.
5178160	5180160	Oh, wait a minute.
5180160	5183160	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
5183160	5185160	I'm getting mental Illinois.
5185160	5190160	I'm going to do a stream talking about things I like and I like and my darling little nerds
5190160	5193160	like and to do that, I guess I'll have to start at the very beginning with nerds themselves
5193160	5196160	and I've already done plenty of research on them.
5196160	5198160	Let's do it.
5198160	5199160	Okay.
5199160	5200160	Why are these?
5200160	5201160	Oh my God.
5201160	5202160	Yeah.
5202160	5204160	You're so smart for coming up with these ideas baby girls.
5204160	5205160	I can't even see you.
5205160	5206160	Oh my God.
5206160	5207160	You're so cute.
5207160	5208160	Head pat.
5208160	5209160	Head pat.
5209160	5210160	Head pat.
5210160	5211160	Right.
5211160	5212160	Okay.
5212160	5220160	Let's go to the night and the moment I get a single wrinkle, I think I'll end things.
5220160	5221160	She's hitting the wall.
5221160	5222160	She's hitting the wall.
5222160	5223160	Oh my God.
5223160	5224160	I'm orb.
5224160	5225160	Is she okay?
5225160	5232160	I feel like these are just like such random emotions like as long as she's happy.
5232160	5235160	Were you even paying attention?
5235160	5236160	Yes.
5236160	5237160	Oh my God.
5237160	5238160	You're so needed.
5238160	5239160	Right.
5239160	5240160	Let's do it.
5240160	5243160	Oh, stress goes up so much talking about these though.
5243160	5247160	Her mental darkness goes up.
5247160	5250160	But communication and rabbit hole go up so much though.
5250160	5254160	Take a deep dive into the conspiracy of the world but don't go too deep.
5254160	5257160	But I want her to do it.
5257160	5258160	Right.
5258160	5262160	She's definitely going to be on stress management but we're doing it.
5262160	5263160	Wait.
5263160	5264160	Yeah.
5264160	5265160	Yeah.
5265160	5266160	We're doing it.
5266160	5267160	She's spain.
5267160	5268160	She's an orb.
5268160	5269160	She's orbudes.
5269160	5270160	Wow.
5270160	5271160	Look at them nails.
5271160	5272160	Hey.
5272160	5273160	You changed your nails already.
5273160	5279160	They're supposed to be blue like your hair color and there's little things.
5279160	5281160	Subscribble on ear.
5282160	5288160	As technology improves by leaps and bounds perhaps one day we will all be bankrupt.
5288160	5289160	Oh wait.
5289160	5290160	Turn it down.
5290160	5291160	Okay.
5293160	5294160	K angel.
5294160	5295160	Hey.
5295160	5296160	Hello.
5296160	5297160	Hello.
5300160	5301160	Hey.
5301160	5302160	Hello.
5302160	5303160	Hi.
5303160	5304160	Hi.
5304160	5305160	Hi.
5305160	5306160	And you come and you come.
5306160	5309160	What would her fan base K angel fan base name be?
5309160	5315160	If she's an angel and you follow an angel I guess so you're a worshipper really.
5315160	5317160	Yeah.
5317160	5319160	You just be fan name would be worshipper.
5319160	5320160	K goals.
5320160	5321160	Okay.
5321160	5322160	Well I can't.
5322160	5323160	Yeah.
5323160	5324160	Yeah.
5324160	5325160	She's a streamer.
5325160	5326160	She's needy.
5326160	5330160	And now we need to the overload of weekend rule credits.
5330160	5331160	Their name is nerds.
5331160	5332160	That's what she said.
5332160	5333160	Oh okay.
5333160	5334160	Okay.
5334160	5335160	Call member.
5335160	5336160	Let's go.
5336160	5338160	See it's so slow.
5338160	5341160	If you don't it's literally so slow.
5341160	5345160	If I don't speed this up but it's like far too fast.
5345160	5347160	I don't know maybe nothing's bugging out.
5347160	5351160	I don't know the game seems pretty like the game seems pretty put well together.
5351160	5352160	Do I need clicker?
5352160	5353160	No.
5355160	5357160	Nothing's happening.
5357160	5362160	Imagine cities of people being controlled by microchips embedded from birth.
5362160	5364160	Going into the deep end.
5364160	5365160	Yeah.
5367160	5371160	I'm barely doing work with work I can watch a game now.
5371160	5376160	We're doing the politician route question mark or the conspiracy not route concert.
5376160	5378160	I see you're also enlightened.
5378160	5379160	Yeah.
5379160	5380160	That's so scary.
5380160	5382160	I got one in my arm.
5382160	5383160	What?
5383160	5384160	What?
5385160	5391160	I've just noticed the music gets quieter when I tab over to do moderation stuff and then.
5391160	5395160	That's a really good detail.
5395160	5397160	I've got a microchip too.
5398160	5399160	Is she going to?
5399160	5405160	I feel like that's going to spur her on to do more microchip to do more of these types of streams.
5405160	5408160	Another government conspiracy.
5408160	5411160	Wait until you learn about that time.
5411160	5415160	The ruling class could manipulate our brainwaves as we like.
5415160	5417160	We'd all use our puppets.
5417160	5419160	Oh my god.
5419160	5421160	I don't want to be main controlled.
5426160	5427160	No way.
5427160	5430160	You mean I could be brainwashed right now?
5430160	5431160	Oh wait.
5434160	5436160	Where's my tinfoil hat?
5436160	5437160	Exactly.
5438160	5440160	We're going to be the tinfoil hat gang.
5440160	5444160	Maybe just maybe we already have those chips in our arms.
5445160	5449160	You could not be suggesting such a thing my innocent VTuber.
5449160	5451160	Idol Angel.
5451160	5453160	Kate Angel.
5454160	5456160	Was that a scream?
5456160	5458160	How did you find out about this?
5458160	5461160	Take that instead of the microchip thing.
5471160	5475160	We'll be living under a dictatorship soon mark my words.
5476160	5479160	We are all on a watch list right now.
5480160	5482160	Kate Angel branded tinfoil hat.
5482160	5484160	Hat marriage win honestly.
5484160	5487160	I'm not going to be able to sleep after this.
5489160	5491160	The music is so good.
5491160	5493160	I don't know who crafted it but.
5494160	5497160	As if that technology could exist.
5497160	5499160	Relax people.
5500160	5501160	Thank god.
5501160	5502160	Phew.
5503160	5505160	Stronecottle's branded tinfoil.
5505160	5508160	Literally just get tinfoil out of the cupboard.
5508160	5510160	That was scary.
5514160	5515160	For now anyway.
5515160	5517160	Oh her eyes are starting to change.
5517160	5519160	Am I noticing that?
5521160	5523160	I'm actually going to leave that one.
5525160	5527160	I'll leave the dystopia one.
5528160	5529160	But yeah.
5529160	5532160	Her eyes are changing or have I just made that up?
5533160	5535160	Please talk about this forever Kate Angel.
5535160	5536160	She's going.
5536160	5538160	Oh my god I'm loving this route.
5540160	5543160	Is the music going up because she's going this route?
5543160	5544160	Because I don't remember.
5544160	5546160	You're not like the other girls.
5546160	5548160	Yeah she ain't.
5548160	5550160	I'm going to make sure of it.
5550160	5553160	I feel like I'm going to fall really hard for Kate Angel.
5560160	5563160	That click mouse button sounds like the
5563160	5566160	Legend of Zelda Minish Cap raindroplets
5566160	5567160	or slime droplets.
5567160	5569160	Let's have a look see.
5571160	5573160	I don't want to be mind controlled.
5576160	5578160	Scary isn't it?
5578160	5581160	It'd be scary if I were real though.
5582160	5584160	How did you find out about this?
5587160	5589160	Um, why do you ask?
5589160	5591160	Am I being interrogated?
5591160	5593160	The government must have sent you to kill me.
5593160	5594160	Wait.
5594160	5595160	Girl.
5596160	5597160	Bless.
5597160	5598160	Amen.
5598160	5600160	Amen in the chat.
5600160	5602160	Why are you guys saying bless or whatever?
5602160	5604160	Because we're a cult though.
5605160	5606160	Bless.
5606160	5607160	We're a cult.
5607160	5608160	Bless.
5608160	5610160	Literally get them hand emojis out there.
5610160	5611160	Bless.
5611160	5612160	Couldn't come up with a better greeting.
5612160	5613160	Greeting.
5613160	5614160	We're about to be out.
5614160	5616160	The cult is forming.
5622160	5623160	What have I done?
5627160	5630160	I should have really like a scream being incorporated into the music.
5630160	5631160	Ah, look at you.
5631160	5632160	Bless.
5632160	5633160	She did it.
5633160	5635160	We do have to maintain.
5635160	5636160	Help me.
5636160	5639160	The microchip in my arm is controlling what I post.
5639160	5642160	Microchips are like whatever because even without them,
5642160	5645160	you still can't prove that we actually have free will.
5645160	5647160	Oh, she's at breaking point.
5647160	5648160	She's at breaking point.
5648160	5651160	Definitely de-stressed day today.
5651160	5653160	Hello, pumpkin spice.
5653160	5657160	I believe this is the biggest de-stresser I can do to you right now.
5657160	5660160	It does take me all the way.
5661160	5664160	If we miss a day of streaming, it takes it to 65.
5664160	5666160	Or if we do that, it's 71.
5666160	5668160	Oh, it's still quite high.
5668160	5671160	I don't want her on edge though.
5674160	5676160	These didn't do anything.
5676160	5679160	If she takes a third one, it gives her an idea,
5679160	5682160	like a psychedelic route you can maybe do.
5684160	5685160	No, right.
5685160	5687160	We'll do...
5687160	5688160	We'll just do this.
5688160	5690160	I know it takes us tonight,
5690160	5693160	but I really want her to do...
5694160	5696160	Oh, I keep ignoring her messages.
5696160	5697160	I'm sorry.
5697160	5698160	I keep forgetting.
5700160	5703160	I'm super like manager in this right now.
5703160	5706160	I'm not like VTuber manager groomer.
5706160	5707160	I'm like proper manager.
5707160	5709160	Like I'm going to make you successful.
5709160	5711160	I get some blue DMs from guys.
5711160	5712160	Oh, my God.
5713160	5714160	On Marshmallow.
5715160	5718160	I don't think I haven't been seeing what I've been getting.
5718160	5719160	But let me just...
5719160	5721160	Let me just say that this is not okay.
5721160	5723160	Wait, what?
5724160	5726160	But that's the best part.
5726160	5729160	Okay, we're doing ASMR.
5729160	5730160	I never thought about doing it
5730160	5732160	in my k-angel outfit profile.
5732160	5734160	Oh, hi, wait.
5734160	5735160	Oh, wait.
5735160	5736160	My clothes are finding crumpled.
5736160	5738160	Do you think that I'll be fine to go on camera?
5738160	5740160	Oh, well, if I can't leave...
5740160	5741160	Oh, wait.
5741160	5742160	No, this is a regular...
5742160	5743160	Oh, well, if I can't leave...
5743160	5746160	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5748160	5749160	I mean...
5749160	5751160	I mean, true.
5752160	5753160	But like...
5753160	5754160	You do get suspended and stuff,
5754160	5756160	but a little head pat because you don't...
5756160	5758160	Who's a good swag?
5758160	5760160	You're my good swag, aren't you?
5760160	5762160	Oh, who's my good swag?
5762160	5763160	Not click-bleat.
5763160	5765160	Not click-bleat.
5765160	5767160	Not click-bleat.
5767160	5770160	Not to collect the eight.
5770160	5771160	Jesus.
5771160	5773160	Lying down and...
5773160	5775160	Is it super comfy?
5775160	5778160	I think I need to get a water and a cola.
5778160	5780160	The words are mashing together.
5780160	5781160	And now I can't get up.
5781160	5782160	Come, please help me.
5782160	5783160	Yes.
5784160	5786160	I'm freaking...
5786160	5788160	I think I have to get a cola and a water,
5788160	5789160	unironically.
5789160	5792160	The words start mashing together if I read for too long.
5792160	5795160	Oh, our stress goes round and round.
5795160	5797160	Is there any stream that doesn't put your stress up?
5797160	5799160	Like, I don't feel stressed when I stream.
5799160	5800160	Is that bad?
5801160	5803160	Do we have to skip?
5803160	5805160	Honestly, do we have to skip?
5809160	5812160	I think we skip and do ASMR tomorrow.
5814160	5815160	Um, no.
5815160	5816160	Not the medication.
5816160	5818160	I don't think that's a good route for you, darling,
5818160	5820160	because if you start relying on it...
5820160	5825160	67 to watch something.
5826160	5830160	65 to play together or...
5832160	5834160	59.
5834160	5835160	59.
5836160	5837160	Yeah, no stream.
5837160	5838160	We'll do ASMR tomorrow.
5838160	5839160	No stream.
5840160	5842160	Let her take a day off, yes.
5842160	5843160	Can't really.
5843160	5844160	I stream every single day,
5844160	5846160	so I'm not really sure what the issue is, hen.
5847160	5849160	If I ever find my special someone,
5849160	5851160	I want to go to the amusement park
5851160	5852160	with them.
5852160	5853160	We can scream together.
5853160	5854160	Scream together?
5854160	5855160	Eat ice cream together?
5855160	5856160	Rape the Ferris wheel?
5856160	5857160	Why would you scream?
5857160	5859160	Oh, an amusement park!
5859160	5860160	Sorry.
5860160	5862160	I thought it meant a park park, like,
5862160	5864160	that one in New York City or something.
5864160	5865160	Why would you scream there?
5868160	5870160	Uh, I made up with Peachhan.
5870160	5871160	I made up with Peachhan,
5871160	5872160	and then things got a bit...
5872160	5873160	What?
5873160	5874160	Wait, you made up?
5874160	5875160	You fell out?
5878160	5881160	Is she, like, super lovey-and-dovey?
5885160	5886160	Monetization.
5886160	5887160	Oh, she got monetization!
5887160	5888160	Congrats!
5888160	5889160	That's perfect.
5889160	5890160	You're amazing.
5890160	5892160	Ignoring you.
5892160	5893160	No, you're not.
5893160	5895160	You're literally freaking sending me emojis.
5896160	5900160	We won't get convicted
5900160	5902160	because those online nerds
5902160	5904160	can pay for our rent, Jesus.
5904160	5905160	Dodged a bullet there.
5905160	5907160	I don't want to have us
5907160	5909160	to stream out on the streets.
5909160	5910160	I really need a cola.
5910160	5912160	I need a freaking...
5912160	5914160	I'm gonna go grab a cola in a war.
5914160	5915160	I'll literally be a second.
5915160	5916160	I'm like...
5916160	5918160	Oh, my God, I can't.
5918160	5919160	There's so many words to word.
5919160	5920160	I don't know if you guys get this,
5920160	5922160	but if you read for too long,
5922160	5924160	all the letters start merging together,
5924160	5926160	and it's really hard to think of.
5926160	5927160	Like, a context,
5927160	5929160	a view of one heritage.
5929160	5931160	The actual word is...
5932160	5941160	It's not over all my feelings.
5941160	5943160	I don't know how you do it,
5943160	5945160	but maybe you're a bit different...
5945160	5948160	And yes, I did just keep talking
5948160	5949160	while I walked into the room.
5949160	5950160	I probably didn't even hear anything.
5950160	5951160	I got my cola in a war.
5951160	5953160	I'm gonna take a little sipping tin.
5953160	5957160	Put my blanket around me again.
5957160	5959160	I'm actually wearing underwear today.
5959160	5960160	I can't believe it.
5960160	5961160	It's a Christmas miracle,
5961160	5967160	But I'm not wearing a hoodie, I've just got my blanket like a poncho, like a poncho.
5971160	5974160	These streams are always a blast to watch, yeah?
5974160	5976160	Are you ready for the rabbit hole route ending?
5976160	5981160	I actually kind of, I'm interested to see what the other endings are.
5981160	5988160	I don't think I'm going to do the other endings, so please don't get excited for a strapped in big long stream or anything like that.
5989160	5994160	I think I will happily watch what the other endings look like.
5994160	5997160	Let's take a little water sipping tin.
5997160	6004160	If you are remaining seated, please do wiggle, move your foot up and down.
6004160	6010160	And if you feel your calf muscles flex, then that's good because that is helping the circulation in your legs.
6010160	6013160	Just do a few of those and then you're good to go.
6013160	6017160	See you later, bye bye, thanks for hanging, I appreciate it.
6017160	6020160	Shibi cotton bum, 30 minutes.
6020160	6022160	Shibi cotton bum, 30 minutes.
6022160	6025160	I will redirect into her though, so don't worry about 30 minutes.
6028160	6030160	That's right, you better wiggle.
6030160	6033160	We're increasing that blood circulation for you.
6035160	6040160	Oh, I just realized I can't hear any game sound at all right now.
6040160	6042160	Is it because of that tab out?
6043160	6049160	No, I guess it's the end of the day, so to symbolize it's the end of the day the music stops.
6049160	6051160	I was like, where is it?
6051160	6055160	You know, some things may be cliche, but they're cliche for a reason like this.
6055160	6058160	Welcome home darling, would you like to have dinner first or a bath or me?
6060160	6063160	Wait, is this cause affection is so high?
6067160	6069160	I think so.
6070160	6075160	The music is different as well and she's animated different.
6075160	6079160	Okay, I like this kind of detail, like these subtle things.
6082160	6085160	Oh wow, I'm like appreciating this game.
6089160	6091160	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
6091160	6096160	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, did we just, we were supposed to do an ASMR?
6097160	6102160	Oh no, she's gonna be crazy for me, she's gonna go frickin' yandere.
6103160	6107160	Oh my god, I don't want her to go yandere, I need to like ignore her a little bit.
6107160	6111160	I don't want her to go yandere, I want her to go politicization.
6115160	6119160	No, no, you have to, you have to stream, you have to stream.
6119160	6129160	Oh no, I'm, I'm, I'm frickin', I, I successfully gripped my feature for talent, but I didn't want to.
6130160	6134160	Right, go stream ASMR please.
6134160	6138160	Okay, it drops affection dramatically doing ASMR, that's good.
6138160	6140160	We'll do that.
6140160	6145160	Go be unaffectionate for your frickin' manager, cause that was highly inappropriate.
6145160	6148160	She's like yandere on me, she's called Mercy Mode, honestly.
6149160	6153160	You're too good, I'm too good in this sheet, she can't, suffering from success literally.
6156160	6157160	Wow.
6159160	6164160	Oh, her eyes are different, am I going crazy or am I just makin' up that the eyes are different?
6164160	6168160	Hi cuties, is your favorite Indian, sorry I just drank a cola, so.
6168160	6171160	Is your favorite Indian Angel, Angel?
6176160	6177160	I love you.
6177160	6179160	Oh wait, no, that's a chat, I love you.
6182160	6185160	Okay, we can do super chats today, I can see it now.
6194160	6195160	Get the hole.
6195160	6196160	What should we talk about today?
6196160	6204160	Oh I know, I've got a bit of a trivia about the corned beef I ate yesterday, what are you talking about?
6206160	6208160	Is this relevant to the ASMR?
6208160	6210160	Is this relevant to the ASMR stream?
6212160	6218160	I don't, oh yeah, corned beef trivia, I've never been so interested in corned beef before.
6218160	6222160	Wait, please talk every day about corned beef.
6222160	6226160	Okay, her chat's actually really funny, I'm gonna give it to him.
6226160	6234160	Corned beef ASMR literally, did you know that corned beef is shaped so because of old canning methods, which would?
6236160	6239160	Is her heart pounding?
6240160	6241160	No.
6245160	6248160	Is her heart pounding because she's so in love at the moment?
6249160	6252160	Good stream, but that's all it was, just good.
6254160	6258160	That's a backhanded comment, so we will remove it because that's not very pleasant.
6259160	6267160	Does this game have scenes that I need to be nervous about?
6270160	6273160	Does this game have scenes that I need to be nervous about?
6274160	6278160	A subbing for sure, omega lol.
6279160	6283160	I did not know that was gonna happen, hey don't look, you can't.
6283160	6287160	I didn't know, okay the game's safe, it's safe, okay it's safe.
6287160	6289160	I didn't know if it was gonna go any further.
6291160	6293160	You've just got yourself a new fan.
6295160	6298160	Oh my god, I suppose I could give you a smaller one.
6298160	6303160	Oh my god, that's so mean when the bikini freaking toggle came on and I'm just meanin' about typing.
6305160	6306160	I didn't even notice.
6307160	6308160	Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
6308160	6313160	Okay this game, this game, I know it's early days because we haven't finished our route
6313160	6316160	but I wanna say this is 10 out of 10 already for me.
6316160	6319160	This game, highly enjoying it, highly.
6322160	6326160	Literally flush emoji, flush emoji momento.
6327160	6328160	This is so good.
6331160	6335160	You're gonna get big I can feel it, yes okay, I thought I read that.
6335160	6340160	Thank you mother for having me, thank you for spawning me in on the same timeline as you stream.
6340160	6343160	You just made me smile for the rest of my life.
6345160	6350160	I suppose as a nicer compliment then I give you a reward.
6351160	6355160	But if she needs to pay rent and get more equipment, cause we got that microphone.
6355160	6358160	I will never forget the stream for as long as I live.
6359160	6362160	Don't worry it's already been archived eight times over, you don't got to worry.
6363160	6364160	Can you do a workout stream?
6365160	6367160	Oh, is there like a fitness route?
6368160	6370160	That would actually be kind of cool, you can like make her boss.
6371160	6373160	I feel like you're trying too hard.
6375160	6376160	You're out.
6376160	6378160	You will not hurt my streamer's feelings.
6379160	6382160	Guess this makes you an arch angel for now.
6385160	6386160	Wait, wait, wait, let me read that again.
6387160	6389160	Guess that makes you an arch angel now.
6392160	6393160	Oh, that didn't work.
6394160	6395160	Oh no, did that work?
6396160	6400160	No, my freaking thing doesn't work.
6403160	6405160	My freaking brooms doesn't work.
6406160	6407160	I'm so sad.
6409160	6412160	No, stop, stop giving me money for something so small.
6415160	6418160	You feel, wait, take my memory wipe beam.
6423160	6425160	Oh, my freaking sand board's dead.
6425160	6426160	I don't know why it's dead.
6428160	6429160	Come on guys.
6429160	6430160	Oh, someone's message me.
6435160	6438160	Oh, Amy is such a fucking hard worker, you know that.
6438160	6439160	Hold on, hold on, game, game.
6441160	6443160	Did I accidentally go a little overboard?
6443160	6446160	Yeah, you're just popped it.
6447160	6451160	Hmm, I got way better numbers showing a bit.
6451160	6452160	Hmm, I wonder how that worked.
6452160	6454160	Hmm, I truly am a mystery.
6455160	6456160	Can I talk to her?
6456160	6457160	Oh, wait, we got our goal.
6458160	6459160	She wanted 100k.
6459160	6460160	She did it.
6460160	6461160	Wait, we've won already?
6461160	6462160	That's not right.
6467160	6469160	Did she not want 100k?
6470160	6471160	This isn't the first time reaching so many.
6471160	6472160	I don't know what's going to happen for you.
6472160	6473160	I'm a bit nervous.
6474160	6476160	She wanted a milk.
6476160	6477160	Oh, Hen, that's greedy.
6477160	6484160	Hen, Hen, you're supposed to take down the capitalist cog of greediness.
6484160	6485160	Okay.
6486160	6488160	I need to thank them for their devotion.
6488160	6492160	Yeah, I think she's going to get, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely do a thank you stream
6492160	6494160	because that's like insane.
6494160	6499160	What we will do is nothing affection wise.
6500160	6503160	Definitely stress though.
6504160	6507160	Yeah, we'll just make her watch two videos in a row, I think.
6507160	6508160	Who goes there?
6508160	6509160	Identify yourself.
6511160	6518160	As long as the fiction doesn't go up, then I'm happy.
6518160	6522160	I was watching this idol video and they were all eating popsicles for some reason.
6522160	6524160	I already know where.
6525160	6529160	Oh, ASMR.
6529160	6533160	Oh, she's wanting the ASMR route, but I'm wanting the different route.
6533160	6535160	I don't know how to get the fricking politician.
6535160	6537160	I want the politician route.
6537160	6538160	Is she okay?
6538160	6540160	You look so annoyed there.
6540160	6543160	Here, Jester asked me what I do and I was like, lol, I'm just a voice.
6543160	6545160	That's what I was saying.
6545160	6550160	If someone ever makes small talk with me, I'm just like, I'm just a voice actor.
6551160	6559160	It's so much easier to explain than be like, I'm an anime woman on Das Interwebs, yeah?
6559160	6564160	I'm just like, oh yeah, the Scottish voice is in demand all the time.
6564160	6569160	You know, I get to play big strong women in my audios.
6569160	6572160	Meanwhile, my audios are like, yeah, take it!
6572160	6581160	Oh, can't she go outside for stress relief possibly?
6581160	6583160	I'm dead, that's so cute.
6583160	6586160	That's so cute, I'm dead.
6588160	6589160	So not cute.
6589160	6591160	Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
6591160	6592160	Love forever.
6592160	6595160	Did I just do that and then she's happy?
6595160	6599160	Is she like talking to herself when she does that?
6599160	6602160	Or is that a reflection on...
6607160	6610160	If I sleep until night, her mental dark...
6610160	6612160	Okay, so sleep gets rid of mental darkness.
6612160	6614160	I think we will do that, that's lovely.
6614160	6616160	Yes, just have a wee nap, hen.
6616160	6618160	You've deserved it, we rest.
6619160	6622160	Okay, mental darkness.
6622160	6623160	I hate this.
6623160	6625160	Shaky.
6625160	6627160	I wouldn't say...
6627160	6629160	Are you okay?
6629160	6631160	Why are you looking at me like that?
6631160	6633160	I woke up on record time this morning, please...
6633160	6636160	This morning is night time.
6636160	6638160	Selfie time.
6638160	6640160	You're such a girl, honestly.
6640160	6642160	Selfie time, I mean...
6642160	6644160	Wait, so why is that highlighted?
6644160	6645160	Give me this!
6645160	6646160	How do I unlock this?
6646160	6650160	Does it tell you how to progress or is it just it happens?
6650160	6653160	I want rabbit holes so badly.
6653160	6655160	But don't go too deep.
6658160	6659160	No.
6659160	6661160	Right, we'll do...
6661160	6664160	Thank you for 100k, because that is very...
6664160	6667160	Special milestone to celebrate and it's fantastic.
6667160	6670160	Just got to look around the ideals.
6672160	6674160	You have to find it, oh...
6674160	6676160	Okay, I think...
6676160	6678160	Conspiracies would be...
6678160	6680160	Not in a video.
6682160	6684160	Okay, we can do this...
6684160	6686160	I need to play that Russian song...
6686160	6688160	La la la la la la la la...
6688160	6690160	I can never remember it.
6694160	6696160	Having my...
6697160	6699160	Coca-Cola, he's too mad.
6704160	6707160	Don't politicians usually have high stress and high mental darkness?
6707160	6708160	I'm very greedy.
6708160	6712160	I thought she said she wanted to become like some sort of...
6715160	6717160	What's Socrates?
6717160	6720160	Like a philosopher to rebuild a new world.
6720160	6722160	I thought that's the kind of route that that angle took.
6722160	6723160	That's what I'm trying to get.
6723160	6726160	Well, that's what I think anyway, I don't actually know.
6726160	6730160	Because I was kind of like, oh, let's be anti-Margaret Fatcher.
6730160	6732160	And like, public...
6732160	6739160	The resources of the nation need to be in the hands of the public and all that kind of thing.
6739160	6741160	Yeah, yeah, I want to make her a god!
6741160	6743160	Yes!
6743160	6746160	Andrei, you've grown so much as an angel.
6746160	6747160	Wow, that's...
6747160	6748160	Your channel grows so fast.
6748160	6751160	Our super, super popular.
6751160	6756160	I'm an angel that came down from Earth from heaven to save everyone on the internet.
6756160	6758160	Default setting too strong.
6758160	6761160	I feel like you've said something similar before.
6761160	6763160	Oh, I can't believe it.
6763160	6766160	I can't believe Streamer repeated one sentence.
6766160	6769160	We're not reading comments for the stream.
6769160	6772160	Thank you for coming to bless us.
6774160	6776160	I like how she's...
6776160	6780160	That's so gross down here, you should go back to heaven.
6780160	6782160	Oh...
6785160	6791160	The internet is oversaturated with users and content, but it's hard to tell what to believe in.
6791160	6793160	Yes, you should do more conspiracies.
6793160	6799160	Whenever you feel lost, I want you to know that you can believe in me.
6799160	6801160	All right.
6804160	6807160	Save us, my angel.
6811160	6813160	And all believers will be...
6813160	6815160	Whoa, we're doing the rapture.
6815160	6816160	All believers will be saved.
6816160	6818160	You just need to have a little fight.
6818160	6822160	As the internet angel, I will always be by your side.
6827160	6831160	It says exactly like that one Russian song.
6832160	6834160	Beginning of a cult, cult, cult, cult, cult.
6834160	6836160	Give me a cult, give me a cult.
6836160	6838160	I want cult ending.
6838160	6841160	I'm so glad we got tinfoil, foil, hat, merch.
6841160	6844160	I wear it all the time when I watch your streams, Kate Angel.
6856160	6858160	That's actually really nice.
6858160	6860160	I think that's a good sentiment.
6861160	6865160	Your smile is bright enough to illuminate the hearts of all 100K of us.
6865160	6867160	Change 100K.
6867160	6869160	Does she not say she eats these?
6869160	6872160	Am I going to fail if I don't get her the numbers sometime?
6872160	6877160	I'd like, do you always get the numbers and it's like a unique ending to whoever?
6877160	6880160	Strongly blessing us with ink in this universe.
6880160	6882160	This game gives Valhalla.
6882160	6884160	I've never played that game.
6884160	6887160	Oh, is this simple?
6888160	6890160	Obviously, thank you.
6900160	6902160	I skipped school a lot so I didn't have any friends.
6902160	6904160	I don't like when she gets a bit real.
6904160	6907160	Only the people online cared about what I had to fuck it up with.
6907160	6910160	I used to sit on Xbox and skip school because I had a rough time.
6910160	6913160	Hold on a minute, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.
6913160	6916160	I feel like a lot of v-tubers probably had a rough time socializing
6916160	6921160	and that's how they've got the internet culture to be a v-tuber in the first place.
6921160	6923160	Or is she idle?
6923160	6926160	She's not v-tubers, she's just idle.
6927160	6930160	I didn't know angels had to go to school too.
6931160	6933160	Valhalla is a great experience.
6933160	6934160	How many ever?
6934160	6937160	Big game, weak game, endurance game?
6937160	6939160	She's v-tuber coded.
6939160	6942160	I was bullied a lot, it's good for being so cute and pretty too.
6942160	6944160	Jealousy is it?
6944160	6946160	Try and stay humble, try and stay humble.
6946160	6948160	Hold on a minute, hold on a minute.
6948160	6950160	Can't relate to that part of it anyway.
6959160	6965160	Did I ever tell you at my job, I actually didn't know it was polite to say good morning to people.
6965160	6967160	That's how socially inept I was.
6967160	6972160	I had to learn to say good morning, which is why I like saying good morning, good evening, good afternoon to you guys
6972160	6977160	because I think that hopefully you do get to learn things with me over time.
6977160	6981160	As long as you have faith in me, I will find you within the darkness.
6982160	6986160	I literally didn't know I was like, you say good morning to your cool workers like a dumbass
6986160	6991160	and I didn't know that that was socializing and really common.
6992160	6995160	Guess that makes you an archangel now.
6995160	6997160	Oh, that's strange.
6998160	7000160	Or is it just to signify,
7000160	7002160	Remember, you're never alone.
7002160	7003160	Bless.
7003160	7007160	We are joining the call, the bless call, bless call, bless call.
7009160	7013160	Kate Angel having 20 concurrent 100k followers to create a part of the game.
7013160	7015160	Oh, unbelievable.
7016160	7021160	I can't promise to save everyone because that would be a lie, but if there's just one person to be saved, where's my person?
7021160	7023160	Can I just say something?
7023160	7025160	Oh, she got found her.
7025160	7026160	Oh, she's greeting.
7026160	7028160	No, didn't cry.
7028160	7031160	We didn't need to cry.
7031160	7033160	Why didn't you draw a cry in?
7034160	7041160	Only thing really to draw me crying is because I'm just so happy with that we did previously.
7042160	7049160	If my smile can grant soul salvation, then I will keep smiling for all the viewers on there.
7050160	7054160	Are we changing her personality as well to become a god?
7060160	7066160	I can't play a game, do Q&A, rate a gigantic turtle around Shinjuku.
7066160	7070160	No, I want her to do the conspiracy theory.
7075160	7078160	None of these are conspiracy theory for later.
7079160	7080160	Yeah, okay, okay.
7082160	7083160	I hate this.
7083160	7085160	Wait, did her stress go up there?
7091160	7093160	Her affection's still too high for us.
7093160	7095160	She's like doing this weird thing.
7097160	7099160	How do I find...
7099160	7101160	Do I find the idea here?
7103160	7107160	I put her stress up her affection down and mental.
7108160	7111160	But maybe it'll give us the fricking...
7111160	7115160	I want the fricking politician.
7118160	7119160	Oh.
7119160	7120160	What?
7121160	7126160	I just found out an author that I've liked ever since I was a kid watches the stream.
7126160	7127160	It's like a dream come true.
7127160	7129160	Someone looks like they'd make me so glad to start streaming.
7129160	7131160	I'm happy that one of my favourites would miss me.
7131160	7133160	But when I replied, he was like, do you want a video called The Disappointment?
7133160	7135160	I fell out of that for the video.
7135160	7137160	I thought this was a real start for the mental.
7137160	7138160	Who says that anymore?
7138160	7139160	Conspiracy?
7139160	7141160	Conspiracy, please?
7141160	7143160	Oh my god, what did you think?
7143160	7148160	Do you ever get curious about what cringy things people have done online in the past?
7148160	7151160	I reckon I could turn my past cringy into content or something.
7151160	7153160	That's like watching your debut stream.
7153160	7156160	Definitely VTubers watching their debut stream for the first time.
7156160	7159160	Over again after a while has passed.
7159160	7161160	I do agree that that's good content.
7161160	7163160	I wouldn't mind showing our mock streams.
7163160	7166160	I wouldn't show the girls' mock streams but my mock stream.
7166160	7172160	I actually did better in my second mock stream attempt than I did in my debut.
7172160	7173160	And that's fact.
7173160	7175160	I'm happy to show it at a later time.
7175160	7179160	It's a good idea, but to be honest, I just don't really want to do it.
7179160	7180160	Oh, I just need to think.
7180160	7183160	And it makes people want to die, but the suffering is what makes it interesting.
7183160	7184160	So I guess I got...
7184160	7187160	Being a streamer is so hard, girl.
7189160	7191160	Being a streamer.
7191160	7193160	I'm not putting you in any way.
7195160	7198160	But then again, maybe the stars have aligned for someone like me.
7198160	7199160	I know it's not.
7199160	7200160	Can we not stream today?
7200160	7201160	Day off, day off, day off.
7201160	7203160	I need to blow some steam off.
7204160	7209160	Right, if you're genuinely not wanting a day off, that's fine with me.
7209160	7212160	I'm going to drug you up and see if that...
7216160	7218160	Oh, she's going to get so messed up.
7220160	7222160	She's going to get so messed up.
7222160	7225160	And it puts her mental darkness up to 32.
7226160	7228160	Are you sure?
7228160	7229160	Yeah.
7229160	7230160	You wanted a break.
7230160	7232160	Pass out on these drugs.
7232160	7233160	Have a good time, hen.
7233160	7234160	Enjoy yourself.
7235160	7236160	Three milligrams of the Azepam.
7236160	7238160	We'll not do this here.
7242160	7243160	Oh, no.
7244160	7245160	Oh, no.
7245160	7247160	I thought you were going to go to sleep.
7258160	7260160	More than the sweet release of death,
7260160	7263160	I crave the sweet, sweet follow account,
7263160	7266160	but still, why is living so hard?
7267160	7270160	I guess I'll pop a few pills before going live.
7277160	7278160	Breakdown stream.
7278160	7279160	No.
7279160	7280160	Uh-uh.
7280160	7281160	Get off lying.
7281160	7282160	Get a break.
7282160	7283160	No.
7283160	7284160	You're getting closed.
7284160	7285160	You asked for a day off.
7285160	7289160	I gave you one and you give me break downstream?
7291160	7294160	When I woke up, the sun was already setting.
7294160	7296160	I still feel so lazy after sleeping so much.
7296160	7297160	Can I just sleep forever?
7297160	7300160	You're probably feeling what's known as the side effects.
7300160	7301160	I'm sorry.
7302160	7303160	Can I just sleep forever?
7303160	7304160	Rest for a turn eight?
7304160	7305160	No.
7305160	7306160	Sure.
7306160	7308160	Do you want to sleep again?
7308160	7310160	That means I don't have to bother living in it.
7314160	7316160	Is she off on or not?
7317160	7319160	I think she may be off on or not.
7326160	7327160	Is she okay?
7328160	7331160	I don't think we should have done that one.
7331160	7333160	Oh, she can go out!
7338160	7340160	Oh, but who's fricking affectionate?
7340160	7341160	Wait, Akihabara.
7341160	7345160	Let's visit nerd culture, popular with young people.
7345160	7346160	Young people?
7346160	7347160	Oh, this is actually really cool.
7347160	7348160	So can we map?
7350160	7351160	Disneyland?
7354160	7355160	Akihabara?
7355160	7356160	Akihabara?
7358160	7359160	Shinjuku?
7359160	7361160	Wait, so it says Shinjuku, but I can't...
7361160	7362160	Alright, okay, okay, okay.
7362160	7367160	Maybe that's where our politician...
7369160	7371160	I forgot sick women!
7372160	7373160	Give me politician!
7373160	7374160	Just go to sleep!
7374160	7375160	Just go...
7375160	7376160	Give me politician!
7376160	7377160	Just sleep one more time.
7377160	7378160	We're going to stream you absolutely to...
7378160	7379160	It fails tomorrow.
7383160	7384160	The moment I go to bed,
7384160	7386160	all these horrible memories come flooding back to me.
7386160	7389160	Oh, because you're on 28A, darkness?
7389160	7391160	Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
7391160	7392160	Oh, that's so sad.
7392160	7394160	Oh, no, you can't...
7395160	7396160	Oh, wait!
7396160	7398160	There actually is an Ace of Arc category!
7400160	7402160	Oh, that's so cool.
7403160	7404160	Okay, that's really cool.
7404160	7406160	How cool is it tomorrow?
7407160	7409160	My silver award is getting for your fur.
7409160	7410160	That's amazing.
7410160	7411160	Okay, that's really good.
7411160	7413160	Wait, but there's actually Ace of Arc.
7413160	7415160	Oh, you're so fantastic.
7415160	7416160	Oh, my God!
7417160	7420160	You need to reach 80 mental darkness to prove...
7421160	7422160	Aww!
7424160	7425160	How...
